A charming country. A lovely people. A small independent republic at the Greek-Danish border, notable for its lack of uranium, petroleum, and cops. A sort of heaven on earth. There is, however, unrest in one part of the capital. FRENCH CONSULATE Mr. consul… The inventor again? Yes but this time it's not perfume, it's motor fuel. For a combustion engine, no doubt. Caramel! Who's there? Sweep. Ah, bravo, bravo! Lola! Lola! Ah! Mr. Consul, hello. I'm surprised, we haven't had the usual explosion. Ah! No, boom boom finished. Presently. Thanks to, it works. Gopec fuel, three speculoos per liter. Three speculoos! That's around five cents pre liter. That's very interesting. Yes, very interesting. You must sell more than three speculoos. I need new coat. That's cost price. For selling price, we do much lower. Does it only work in engines? No, everywhere. Do you have the lighter? Look, a lighter. Little flame. Ridiculous. Teeny tiny. Ridiculous little. Presently, here is Gopec lighter. Not very presentable, your excuses, why I don't have the financial means for work, you see. But Gopec lighter! Three drops, two years. Rocket, ten drops, to the moon. Very interesting… Don't you think it's hot in here? It's very hot, yes. And why? I also put Gopec fuel in oil stove. It's melting! Yes, because it's too powerful. It requires a little… …it's just I lack the financial means. Poor Gopec. I lack everything. Very interesting. No, keep. Gopec France friendship gift. He didn't shave. So interesting. Oh, it's melting. Gopec fuel, it's in the stove. Like you say in French. Gopec tried it for me. It's extraordinary. Anyways, tonight take this directly to my nephew Barratier at the Ministry. Of course, Mr. Consul. With this, we could make it to the embassy in Washington. As for your nephew, every door will open for him with his dynamism and valor. Ministers, if I may have your attention. Answer carefully---what is this? At first glance, it is a lighter. -Bravo! Very perceptive. -Thank you. Mr. Minister, please light it. But I don't see why we should care. I insist. Go ahead. Press the little gizmo here. Do you recognize the power here? Excuse me. And the device wasn't even at full power. No. Lighting a cigar from afar, even by phone is child's play with this. With this fuel in a heater you can heat the opera like a large furnace, in two seconds. With this fuel, Paris-Marseille in one hour by car. Avoiding Montélimar, of course. Do you see? One hour by car. After three weeks in hospital at Fontainebleau. Well, everyone must work. You always reject progress. You have a retrograde quality. Daddy's car? We'll build highways. Well, who knows. Why not? Second point, capital. Its meager price is five cents per liter. Ah, that's excellent. Instead of taxing 80% per liter we can go up to 90%. Then we could eliminate the vehicle tax. What? Hold on. -And what else? -I've had an idea. An idea? Yes. This fuel could deal a serious blow to the petroleum industry. But petroleum, it's mainly the English and Americans. You know what you must do. Understood. You must be proud of your fiancé. Very, I am. And now he has no excuse for not marrying. I think you should open tap four a bit. And I think you should close your valve a little bit. Leave me in peace. I don't tell you how to make goulash. Nothing is working! It's all clogged up. Mr. Consul, you know it's hard working with expired, used up materials. Mr. Gopec, what would you say if I offered you a modern, well-equipped workshop where you can make your fuel all expenses paid. I'd say, "fairy tale." You'd be wrong. Because my government would like to offer to pay for all of your work in the best possible conditions. -Me? -Yes, in Paris. In Paris? Paris, France? -Yes. -Why you didn't say sooner? Just need time to pack bags. Oh, Paris! Shopping, fashion, Rue de la Paix. What's this? Telegraph signals? Look, miss… You think I'll let him go to Paris alone? Listen my juicy little Cornish hen, maybe to start it's better I go… Yes, it's necessary. No, I saw an American documentary on the lives of Parisian women and they were always undressing. No! If you go to Paris, I go too. And no discussing! And no discussing! Mr. Barratier, I didn't expect you to come up with a plan so quickly. You're very kind, but it's thanks to you, Mr. Minister. I took your advice. I dotted my i's and crossed my t's. My t's are more dotted and my i's are more crossed. I also made much progress on my speech. This candy thing is great. Well obviously, since it's improvised, it's not much, but… Yes, but the fact remains that you are taking a considerable risk. If you fail… If I fail, oh yes, I know. I'll be demoted to secretary of the deputy Consul. In Bamako. Bamako. Bamako, that's in? Oh, it's sad in winter in Bamako. Don't worry, Minister. It's all planned. I have two good men. Hello, you. It's not the time. Demosthenes awaits. A minister can wait. An Attaché de Cabinet cannot. Let's go. What're you doing for him? Protection services darling. When a VIP visits, we hover around them. They chose the best looking. So you're gorillas. She understood nothing. A gorilla is instinctive, primitive. It's in the shoulders. But we're above that. We watch over the visitor while ensuring an agreeable visit. You're between a cop and a travel agent. Oh, she's funny. See you soon my darling. Wipe your feet. -Hello Mr. Attaché de Cabinet. -Hello gentlemen. I need you for an extremely sensitive mission. A confidential mission requiring vigilance, tact. You've chosen the right men, Mr. Attaché. Mr. Attaché de Cabinet. Yes… It's a vital project with the potential to disrupt the global economy. Here, try this lighter. Oh, if I may, Mr. Attaché. -You're welcome. -De Cabinet! Ah, yes. Perhaps it won't quite disrupt the global economy yet. -Would you take a look? -Yes. I may have better luck. -Mr. Attaché. -De Cabinet. -Ah. -Look. May I? -Give it to me. -Mr. Attaché. De Cabinet, here. -Oh, ah! -Look at that. With a device like that I could be very popular. Ah, yes, and get a spot on the metro at rush hour. Light it to call 911, right away. Yes, or for winter parties. Or to cut through sheet metal in a car accident. Not bad! Or as a super lighter. And how do you put it out, Mr. Attaché? Excuse me. Ah, are they sold together? It must make the pockets bulge. Sit down. -Thank you Mr. Attaché. -De Cabinet. It's a special fuel. Yes, very special I see. The inventor must finish. Yes, people will wonder because… He is coming to Paris for this. You must understand that it's impera- it's impera- Just a second please. Okay. It's imperative to have the utmost level of secrecy and silence. No one can know anything. This work is top secret. Yes, we know. Oh? Who told you? The bistro owner across the street. Disgraceful. In any case, your job is to watch over the inventor and invention. Again, top secret! He agr- Excuse me one second. He has agreed to limit his outside contacts to the strict minimum required for mental health. A monastic life would be ideal. That will be fun. Yes. In any case, we insist that no one, aside from a few qualified individuals and the bistro owner, know about this invention. Gentlemen, Olympic Petroleum is in peril. What I don't understand is how such a fuel was created without our knowledge. You're wrong. We knew about it. What were you waiting for? Simply for the patent to be registered. Then we would have bought it. The Paris initiative beat us to it. And at the exact moment when our revenue finally surpassed Royal Benzine, our main competitor. And at the exact moment when we took Lichtenstein from Olympic Petroleum. Up until now, we have always managed to eliminate these incredible "fuels." Now it's petroleum itself that is threatened. Gentlemen! Complaints are useless. We must act. And what do you propose? Here is my idea. Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Mr. Morrison, the most fierce individual that you have ever met. Mr. President, I'm confused, actually. He resolves the most complex problems, those for which there is no solution that is… legal. His latest success is the revolt that overthrew the sultan of Kiwitt. It's nothing really. And Mr. Blackman who put the son of the sultan of Kiwitt on the throne. Just doing my job, gentlemen. I propose we give him carte blanche. Oh, if I may, carte blanche, it always leads to arguments after. So, what are the limits? Shall we say, systematic sabotage? Are we in agreement? Mr. Gopec, the government has sent us to accompany you and facilitate your visit. Thank you. Very hospitiful. So we begin with Folies Bergère? Casino Paris? And why you seem constipated? I thought French were fun. Paris woohoo! And your work, Mr. Gopec? Listen, we aren't going to work day and night? Of course you will have free time. We are here to facilitate things. Thank you. You will have a very nice workshop, fully equipped. Did you plan for… Retorts, of course. I do this, and you think of retorts. So Paris has a decidedly false reputation, truly. Excuse me, gentlemen. No! This way. What? What is it? Parisian ladies. Grab him. He's going to take off. This way. She's here! I'm not here. Go on! Tell her whatever you need to, but I'm not here. I did what I could. Hiding over! Everytime I come, you not here. I got you, this time! Listen, miss, I'm very busy. I want to join fiancé Paris! Give visa! Listen, miss, I'm sorry. I have orders. You can't have a visa. You don't give visa? Hold on. Let's stay calm. The last one told me no, he has nervous breakdown. Well, miss. I have diplomatic immunity. I bet you don't. Miss, think of poor Mr. Gopec, toiling over his test tubes right this moment. Madame is my girlfriend. I forgot! Be careful. Here! Go Gopec! Come on! Get up! Go Gopec. This is Paris! This is Paris! Mr. Gopec, what is this? Demosthenes, come here. Please. Hey, you participate fun? Am I dreaming, or what? I heard during hard times you stay in back of house. But we say "backstage." That's not the point. You call this work? Listen, if man not have fun, man not work. This French? Understand? Yes? Go dance! Relax, Demosthenes. Yes, come on, you smell of starch. I smell of starch? Oh! Your friend is smart. Miss, I am the Attaché de Cabinet at the Ministry. Attaché, your days must be so long. Oh, my glasses. Miss, give me my glasses right now. Change of partners! Bravo, Barattier. You're promoting cabarets now? No, I can explain, Mr. Minister. I hope so. It's simple. I arrived at the hotel and they told me, go to the Crac Boum. You know me. I was suspicious. I went there quickly, looked around, and what did I see? They were there. -I took the situation into my hands. -I see. I go to find them… And where did you look? I know, Mr. Minister, it looks bad for me. Yes, it does. Including your expense report, which covers three arrondissements. You exaggerate. Perhaps two. No irony, Barratier. You're off to a bad start. Yes. Winters are sad in Bamako. Yes. Morning. Where's the bathroom? Hey. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I think I just saw a woman walk by. Whenever you have a vision, don't hesitate to wake me. Oh la la… -Go on, the party's over. -But! Go on. Go, put this on. I've never been dressed by men before. Yes, go on. It's funny, ha ha! Put this in your memoire. The sweater too, right? -Seriously! -Come on. Go on! Here, put this on. What about breakfast? It's bad for your figure. Watch your love handles. Goodbye. Go home. See you very soon. Thank you. Goodbye. Listen, I think I had a head here last night. What happened after midnight? I don't know. I think I ate the comforter, yuck. Oh, Gopec. No! Get up! So! Feeling good this morning? Did you have a good night? Relaxing? Shall we get to work finally? Oh, aren't we eloquent? Yes, and so gracious. A waking man is lovely. Yes, it gives an air of power. You are not funny and not hospitiful at all. Disasters on feet. But we know places. Yes, we know nightclubs, with little dancers. Yes, tit for tat, or else… Here we are. The neighborhood is quiet. Quiet? It's necrologic here. No noise, no neighbors. No neighbors, no neighbor ladies! Oh, look. It's nice, huh? Gizmo! What's he saying? It works? Ah, it works. If something doesn't work, don't hesitate to call us. We're next door. We'll be with you from now on, Mr. Gopec. Good news. Thank you. GORILLAS DON'T FLOAT IT'S INVIGORATING BORDER, 2 KM Ho! Are you going to Paris? Yes, get in, miss. It would be my pleasure to take you. You know, I can only drive two. No foolishness. Oh. It's going very well. Just a little mechanical problem. When you mix things you never know what you'll get, so there will be surprises. You're there, not worried, then poof! Just like that. But it's going very well. Really. I'm at the Globe Hotel. Bye. You again? -Last, as usual. -Why are you here? Watch my eyes. Ah… If I understand, our goals are aligned. Possibly. Nothing like a common enemy. Sabotage? Sabotage. Thank you. No, thank you. I have my gas. Who are the two guys with him? Inspectors Pounet and Verdier. Security detail. Susceptible to feminine charms. -Interesting. -I'm way ahead of you. Good evening. -Are you the one who called? -Yes. There are two of you? I don't like that. Allow us to clear up a little misunderstanding. Sit down, please. So here's the thing. To love. To love! Yes, to love. Barman! A bottle of champagne. Quickly! No, I would like a Mau cocktail. Yes, miss. A Mau cocktail, what is that? I will let you taste it. Okay, but after this, to bed. We're low on credit. Yes, to save some firepower. Firepower? Another cocktail, no? -No, a pastis instead. -A pastis. Not understood at all. I never understand when French speak. Maybe you have too much accent. I maybe don't understand, but I hurt my head trying to understand. In my country I make puns always. I'll tell you a funny one. Ah, here we are. Here, drink. It will make you float. I'm going to float. It's time you take him upstairs to bed. Ah, I take him. It's nice you always volunteer for the hardest tasks. -Don't be like that. -Please. Come on, to bed. Are we going to take the two ladies? They will follow. Don't worry. Here we go. Come on. Don't take too long. No. I should probably go too because… Must you really? Oh, no. Oh. I'm floating. Yes, you're going to float. You're going to float to bed. Go on. To bed. Here we are. Uncle Verdier will be back soon. Where you are going? Why are you going in the bathroom? Coming. -What is it? -It's Verdier. I'll disable the alarm. Oh, this will be good for the big gentleman. Hello, Globe Hotel? Room 32 please. Yes, I'm listening. Hello? What is that? The alarm, oh my god. Hello? Oh my god. Here. -Drink this. -Which one? The middle one. Drink! And don't move. Don't move… Pounet! The alarm at the lab. I'm going. Take care of Gopec. I'll go tuck in the little one and come back. -Go quickly. -I will. Hey! What's going on? I won't spend the night in here. Someone knocked you out? Yes, but I didn't have time to see a thing. Feel the bump. But you opened the door. Why? -Because it was you. -How? I heard "It's Verdier" through the door, so I wasn't worried. Tell me, was it you who called? No, it wasn't me. Come on… It's over, right? Your papers! Where are your manners? Sonia, we're going to bed. Yes but not here. Yes, here. We're going for a little walk. In the country. -Who's this? -He's my brother. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Stop playing with the elevator! I'm not playing. I'm trapped! We're going to party. -Where? -At the Gare de Lyon. Oh my gosh, Gopec. No, the Gare de Lyon. Ah, Gare de Lyon. But why the Gare de Lyon? We are going to party in the train? We're going to party. There. There is an idiot playing with the elevator. Thank you. Excuse me ladies and gentlemen. What are you doing up there? What am I doing? Making crepes! What are you doing there? I'm looking for the bathroom. Get back inside. We're going to the train station. To the Gare de Lyon. -They stole Gopec! -What? Yes, I heard "Gare de Lyon" Quick! What were you doing? -I was in the… -You're terrible! Come on. Let's go. And Sonia, where is Sonia? Buying newspapers. -Newspapers? -She's coming. -Is Sonia going to come? -Yes. I've never partied in a train before. -He's not in his usual state. -Not in his… And you're in your usual state with this head of yours. You're lousy! -He's lousy! -Go on. Here's his ticket, his passport, and don't wake him before Rome. -Under any circumstances. Here you go. -Thank you, sir. Sonia. Is she coming, Sonia? -Yes, she's coming. -Sonia's coming. Here, taste this for me. There. It's track M. It's over here. Come on. Sonia. Yes, Sonia will be here very soon. Sonia. Once he's in Rome with no clothes, a fake passport… The contents of his bag… We won't be seeing him anytime soon. We're not done. The train is leaving. Yes, number seven. Come on. Get up! What is this? Oh no, you again. But, no! Where we go? We're going this way. Let's go! I don't want to. My hat! Give me my hat. -Let's go. -But what… What are you doing on the train? You took the train, not us. I didn't take the train. I came to party. Woohoo! First, have a drink. Please, vodka-whiskey. In the same glass? Of course in the same glass, there's but one gullet. Vodka-whiskey. Yes, that's peaceful coexistence. Give him a bottle of each, or we'll never get him out of here. Come on. Leave that. Let's go. Lean on me. That's it, lean. Come on. Ah, the train, the car. Next you take me to boat. He's funny. Don't push me! Little delicate fragile flower. Our little delicate flower attracts butterflies. Sonia bought the newspapers? Yes, she's waiting for the latest edition. We should have sent him in a plane. In a trunk. It's already done. Never laugh. Always work. Never sleep. You'll sleep, but in your bed. It's much more interesting. -What is it? -Nothing. Sleep. Pounet, come here. -Look. -My god. 20 million in counterfeit francs. The guys who sent him on the train with this suitcase didn't mean him well. Our information was definitive. No one knew about his projects. You must accept that someone is trying to stop this work. The first thing to do is to move discreetly because they could blow up the lab. If you're interested, I know a perfectly discreet location, Mr. Attaché. -De Cabinet, I know. -Yes. Excuse us. Hello my darling. Did you mistake me for one of your cabaret dancers? Look sweetheart, I was on orders. You do have a disciplined air. Come on. Mr. Barratier, please. First door on the right, miss. -Thank you. -Good day, miss. That Demosthenes. That pig. Let's go. -Sir! -Miss, what is it? -I'm Lola Kreminski. -Ah. -Gopec's fiancé! -Oh. -I want to see him. -Impossible. How impossible? Mr. Gopec is working on a top secret project. Yes, his gasless gas. That's it. His gasless gas. You know about it? Everyone at home knows. We must take precautions. From now on, all visits are forbidden. Not for me! Listen, miss, insisting is useless. I will not compromise! Oh, little mean curly man. He wants to scare me. Oh, that's not nice. Listen miss, you cannot… absolutely cannot… You are cruel with me. I so need affection. The women of my country are all great lovers. Close your eyes and say yes. Really, Barratier? On the job? Yes, but no, Mr. Minister, this lady asked me, but of course I refused. Yes, we agreed like that. But I was firm, however. Please. -I see. -Who is this one here? This one here is his minister. So his boss? I guess. Tell him I want to see Gopec. And fast. Hurry, okay? Or I'll squash you both! Let me go! -Hold onto her until the border. -Yes sir. I will call the Embassy! I am Gopec's fiancée! To the Gare de l'Est, and step on it. Let's go. No, not here. No. If you plan no fun, Gopec no work. But look, Mr. Gopec, the fresh country air, blessed joy of nature. No, too far from cabaret. It's not… But don't worry. I planned everything. I invited a stunning young person to spend the weekend with us. No! Bravo. Him very intelligent. You complete idiot. No, but I also planned it. No! Ah, intelligent both. Fun! Stock market troubles for petroleum prices. Time is running out. Despite my distaste for violent solutions… This inventor is no doubt very venerable, but it's him or us. We must eliminate Gopec. I received new instructions. Yes, me too. -Eliminate the inventor. -It was only a matter of time. The future of the human race depends on dividends. -Oh, look, our guest. -Is she a good girl? Impossible to say before taking stock. Hello everyone. Beautiful spot. Marvelous idea, inviting me. Mr. Gopec, Miss Elyane Tournier. Miss, Gopec drenched with enthusiasm to see marvelous beauty in little miserable farm house. Mr. Gopec, how gracious you are. I'm not used to this kind of talk. In my country, miss, woman is goddess. I think we will get along great. It's this way. Hey, what is this hanky panky? In the interest of our great nation, purple mountain's majesty, you see? I'll tell you what you can do with your purple mountains. -You're truly vulgar. -At times, certainly. Hello, you. You don't say… Thank you for inviting me. You've met already, no? Oh yes. Miss! Gopec drenched with enthusiasm to see you here. Mr. Gopec, at least you know how to speak to a woman. Come, we will do it in stereo. -What? -Purple mountain's majesty. Old friend. Paris travel… There it is. You're right. We tracked them down. Of course. So, Barratier, are you going to explain? It's going great. Truly it's, a great success, by god. Country life is monotonous. Let's add a little good clean fun. First we must separate the two chicks. It would look very bad for us to shoot the weaker sex. Not tonight, darling. A mouse! -What is it? -There! A mouse! Disgusting! What's going on? What is this? Do something! Disgusting. -Don't panic! -There it is! My little tuft. No, not grated cheese for mice. They don't like that. -A nice piece with holes. -There! My bra! They don't seem impressed. Is that insecticide or mouse vitamins? -No! -Don't be afraid. Come with Uncle Gopec. No! Here. There! We're leaving immediately. Okay. Let's get dressed. This mouse thing is weird, isn't it? Indeed, I was just thinking the same. Many strange details in this situation. I don't know… Baudry. -Mr. Inspector. -There we go. -Clever. -Pounet, come see. When you do two things at once… It must have fallen in the stew. Here we go. That's too bad. Oh my god. Look at that. Brand new. -Do you see what I see? -That's a strange shape. What do you think, Baudry? It fell. And your head fell with it? I don't get it. One bump there, two bumps. A whole career in law enforcement, in relief on his head. Baudry, how many times did they beat you? -How many times? -Yes. How many times, Baudry? Twice, but I'm new, Mr. Inspector. It won't happen again. Eyes open. I hope so. It's done. He saw me. Bravo beautiful. Prepare the net. Good. Now's the time. You rang, miss. I'm lonely. Being alone is making me sad. That's funny. Me too, being alone is making me sad. Come! -We'll take care of this. -This wasn't in the plan! What is she doing? Going inside with him? -Really. That's fantastic. -She's crazy. There. With this, goodbye neighbor lady. He's going to sulk. Okay. Tell me that at my place. No way. We can't leave him alone for a minute. No! Leave in peace, please! Who are these savages? We're from the society for morality and protection of young women. Allow us to accompany you away from this troll. Listen, you two! I'm getting tired of you barging in everywhere like bulldozers each time I… Each time I don't need you! You machicolation, vol-au-vent, caramel! Okay, it's time to go. He's going to get nasty. You mustn't! You mustn't exhaust yourself and waste your brain power. I want to waste my brain power! -It's my brain power. -No! -Yes! -No! -We're done. -I'm getting very fed up! If you're going out sad and alone one night don't hesitate. I have a great record collection, a Hi-Fi stereo. Here's my card. And what tax bracket are you in? Maybe we should think about working a little now. -Friend. -Work… No! Gopec no work. -So? -It's fine. She won't be coming back. Oh good. We have gotten rid of the nice women. Okay, so going outside is forbidden, fine. But it's not forbidden take bath, no? How then? Good, let's go. No. Leave them. You don't need them. -I do! -We'll take care of your little things. In my country, we bathe in our blouses. No, you don't need to bathe in your suit. -…our pants. -No. No. Thank you. You are really very kind. That's what we're here for. Go on. Go take a bath. Go. Mr. Gopec. He's cute. He's playful. His little things. His shirt. His blouse. Take a bath in his suit. Really. He must really think we're… It's overflowing! Oh my gosh. Come help me. One… Two… Look at this. He's daring. And pantless. Would you believe it. Let's go. My little ducky. Wait for me. Wait for me. What is this? Can't you be more careful! But I didn't do anything. I just sneezed. Hold on. You broke my window with a sneeze? Have you never heard of ultrasounds? Ultrasounds? No, but listen, grandpa, don't you take me for an idiot! Grandpa! First of all, I'm not your grandpa! Get down. Quick! Go! CHLOREJEX THE FAMOUS TOOTHPASTE WITH CHLORINE That's clever. Imbicile! Quiet little neighborhood, huh? So? I go back to my country. There! Follow them! -No, these are my pajamas. -Let's go. Why moving again? Kidnapping in Paris. -Here shooting. -We have orders! Orders! Orders are protect Gopec! Not his pajama… Leave that! That's why we're going. We will spend even more time with this unlawful life? We will know soon. You again! This one again? Who are you? I am Gopec fiancé! Miss, I already told you… Hello little pigeon! You pay taxi. And move aside. Take care of the taxi and step aside. -Come pay. -Yes, okay. Here, wait. -Here's some money. -Thank you. And the return fare please, sir. Ah, return fare too. Yes, of course, sir. Thank you. I don't need change. Thank you, sir. -Lola! -Why did you leave the country without me? My little juicy little Cornish hen, I can explain. I have so many works to do. Tell her, sir. He's right. Relax, miss. May I? No you may not! Leave in peace. -I have an urgent thing. -I go with you! Listen, miss, there is no… There are mo… There are moments when you mustn't get irritated. If you want my opinion, you should open tap four a bit. Tap four again! Always tap four! With you, marriage, tap four. Obsession. No, it's not obsession. It's feminine instinct. I feel. I feel too. If he gets another fiancé or two he'll end up in 78 soon. No question. The general said one month. Yes but the young lady said "leave us in peace." So that's what we will see. They're going to wear him down. I hope he has a clothing allowance. Lord. So when are you leaving? I'm not leaving! Come now, it's dangerous. Not now. I'm here. I know little chick. Each time he does boom boom, there are ladies. Oh really? Each time there are ladies, he mixes bad, blows it all up. Boom boom. -Oh my gosh. -So that's why. Oh no, with me, no more boom boom. Ah, no more boom boom. Look. Now you understand? -Ah, she's the one? -Indeed. Let me. I'll take care of her. -Where is Lola? -What? -Where is Lola? -What? -Where is Lola. -Lola! Ah, Lola! Where is she. She is taking care of business. Oh good. She's coming out. Let's get her. We'll find out. -Come. -What is this? What do you want? I'm Gopec fiancé. You will regret this. Let me go. Go! -Hello? -Mr. Gopec, please. -Who's speaking? -Guess. A guy's asking for Gopec. What's he like? How would I know, stupid? Mr. Gopec, the phone is for you. Don't hang up. -Me? -Yes. -Hello. -Hello, Mr. Gopec? Yes, it's me. Miss Lola is our guest. Her return depends on you. Under certain conditions. Conditions? There are none! There are no conditions. Keep as long as you want. Just don't let her escape. Understood? Thank you. Kisses. Do you ever dream of an office job? Nine o'clock. Noon. Two. Six. No initiatives. No responsibilities. The turn signal! Unless we declare war. I don't see how we can raid a barracks. Yes, there, good. It looks all finished. Oh, it's finished! -And here's your room. -Room? -Yes. -No! -What? -Gopec not sleep there. That's not funny. It's not funny! You only think of fun. Yes. Everyone thinks of fun, no? Not him.
