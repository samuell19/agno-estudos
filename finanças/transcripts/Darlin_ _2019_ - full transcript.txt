Red... red. Whore! Sorry. I know. What's troubling you now, Charlie? Life. Charles, we can't have you sit there when there's nothing wrong with you. Of course something's wrong with me, I'm homeless. Then go to the mission. I'm not a church going man. Well then, you're in the wrong place here, too. Incoming. Oh shit. We gotcha. No, no, no, stay still. Holy shit. Hey there. Hey, little one. What have you found? Sorry but you have to go now. I won't hurt you. I'm a nurse. Okay. Who are you? I got her. How's our mystery patient? Doctor, since when do we sedate a teenage girl? She was a danger to herself. Alright, tough guy, after an ambulance hit her, she immediately bounced back, tried to rip my hand off like an animal. She was beginning to trust me. She had you on your knees. When are you gonna get used to CHO running things? When they start making directives to serve patients, and not the church. So what's gonna happen to her now? Well, she doesn't have a broken bone in her so she's not gonna stay here. Probably place her in care until they find her a family or whatever. She'll be at St. Philomena's by this weekend. Great... Philomena's. Oh, so now you got a thing for Philomena's, too? Well they turned me and Robert down as adoptive parents before they even met us... seemed like a homophobic move. Maybe they were thinking about the children. Hi. Sorry I'm late out babe, you didn't need to come in. Yeah, I did. You never could resist a stray. Lucky for you. Asshole. - Luck... - Don't ruin it. Come on fam, let's go home. Tell me everything. Well, molar scans suggests she's sixteen... possibly seventeen years old. - She looks younger, don't you think? - Yes. Everything is foreign to her. Television, cellphone. Lucky girl. I apologize, I must take this. Of course, Bishop. Good afternoon, Your Eminence. Would you mind holding a moment, Your Eminence? Yes. It's the boss... one of them. Oh, excuse me. Yes, sir. So what do we know of her history? Virtually nothing. She won't talk. We don't know if it's short term, or if she's just out of practice or... Or? Could be aphonia. That's er, that's the desire to speak but believe that you can't. We don't know how long she's been isolated. A true innocent. Completely feral. it's incredible. I'm not really sure she's always been feral, Bishop. As I say... No evidence of a family? No, not yet. It's extraordinary. Why won't she turn around? There you are. This is sister Jennifer. - Hello. - Pleasure, Sister. She splits her service between The Sisters of Mercy homeless mission downtown. Our girl's care home, Philomela's. Where she was in care herself. It was that experience that brought her to God. I see. So you see, Doctor. She will have a mother of sorts. As well as a father. Not feral, you say? On a low carb diet? Same. I'm gonna miss you too, weirdo. Thank you Lord God for sending this innocent child to me... that she may be a testament to your kindness. Strengthen Sister Jennifer, that she may bring forth language from her lips. That this newborn soul, when obedient to you, may speak of all Philomena's has done for us. So that they won't cut off our funding and close us down. Sweet Jesus, have pity on the poor sinners and save them from hell. Have mercy on the suffering souls in purgatory, Amen. Amen. That, is why I said you were already working at Philomela's. This is my mission for you. Come back to your old home and show her the way. A feral child, converted by God's love, they can not close us down after that. Why would the Cardinal let that happen? It's been a very difficult year. We can barely keep the pews filled, let alone the collection plates. But this miraculous child, like Moses in the basket, has been sent to us. Don't you feel it? I'll make your lie a truth. I'll split my time between the mission and Philomena's. In fairness, you would've done it anyway. Because I'm not asking... God is. Yes, your Excellency. Welcome to Saint Philomena's Group Home For Girls. She's a little shook up. Don't know if she's ever been in a car. She wanted to touch everything. Cars can be exciting. Yes. Sisters, this is our new girl. Well, help her in, Sister Jennifer. She'll starve out here if we let her. She'll grow here, I promise. "Hysterical aphonia: "Treatments include a suffocation of the patient "to evoke a vocal cry of alarm, "use of electricity, "holding tight the tongue, the water cure "or cocaine applied to the laryngeal mucosa, otherwise known as the throat muscles." Well, we can't try any of those anymore. Not unless, you still have access to cocaine, Sister? My drugs were heroin and meth-amphetamine... and my past is behind me. You see, anyone can be changed with God's mercy. What has your search lead you to? Speech therapy, I found some information online. Wonderful, but we must get footage of her as she is now, animal-like. Why would the press care if we don't start with a feral child? It's not just that the devil tries to trick the devout. We too can trick the devil into doing God's work. It's your turn. Chill out, I'm just finishing this. ADD, does anyone not have ADD? New girl, you play cards? You're gonna get into some major shit if you don't learn how to talk. Since when did you care what everyone else did, Bug? Since someone younger and prettier than her came in. Yup, Bug's getting more pissy, the closer she gets to aging out. No family if gonna take her now. Don't make me slit both your mouthy little necks in the night. Yeah right, you won't last a day back in juvie. Fuck you know about juvie? Just sayin'. Will y'all keep it down. I don't want him coming in here. You wanna know how to survive a snake attack in the jungle? - No. - No. I do. You come across one of those big man eating snakes like a Anaconda, you can't outrun them because they're too big. But, if you see one before it strikes, you got a chance, so what you do... is fall to the ground, stay real still like you're dead. They eat dead things but with carrion, they start with the feet first, unhinge their jaw and start swallowing you from the feet up. But when they get just up under your knees that's when you start kicking like crazy from inside of them and then you'll just bust his jaw right off that way. Hello, Sister Jennifer. Darlin', you're to come with me, the Bishop would like to see you. Come on. It's okay. Get her in there, Jenny. This needn't take too long. She doesn't wanna go, she's afraid. It's okay that she's afraid, go in there with her if need be. She looks normal. Perhaps we should dirty her up a bit. Careful Sister, careful. Hold onto her. Hold onto her! That's enough. That's enough, Sister. Sister, we got it. We've got it. it's okay. It's okay, It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, my child. it's okay, my child. I'm sorry. It's okay. Sometimes doing the right thing isn't easy. It's okay, my child. It's alright. It's okay. It's okay. We did a good thing tonight, Sister. There can be no "after" without a "before"... just ask Jesus. We have a special new girl with us today. She's going to join our little family for awhile, until she finds her own. Who would like to explain the rules of the home to her? Ah. Speak separately, we're not in choir. No hitting. No cursing. No drugs or alcohol. No outside food. No secular music. Do your prayers, your chores, your studies and your confessions with grace. A happy face is a mirror to God. Glory be to God and to The Church. Amen. Now, today we will be studying evolution... the evolution of sin. So, for our new girl, we will start at the beginning, at original sin. Open your bibles to Genesis chapter 2 verse 4. This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created by the Lord God. Girl? Girl, you heard the rules? You will do your studies with grace. Sweet Jesus. I wasn't going to hit her. Sister Jennifer, why don't you make yourself useful. Ah... Bug, can you please continue with the next two verses. The Lord God had not sent rain on the Earth and there was no one to work the ground... but streams came up from the Earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Billy. Now, the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals Lord God had made. He said to the woman "Did God really say, "you must not eat from any tree in the garden". That's a warning, Billy. Sorry, Sister Jennifer. "The woman said to the serpent "'We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, - "'but God did say, you must not eat fruit "'from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it or you will die!'" Billy! Carry on. [together[ "You will not certainly die, "the serpent said. "For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened..." Please! Please, don't take me to him. I'll reign it in, I swear... He'll know what to do, that's all. Then the Lord God said to the woman, "what is this you have done?" "The woman said, 'The serpent deceived me and I ate.'" "And I will place enmity between you and the woman, "and between her offspring and yours, "and he will crush your head "and you will strike at his heel... and to the woman he said... " Thank you, Sister Grace. I'll continue. It's the new girl's turn. Read on. "I will make your pain in childbearing very severe "and with painful labor you will give birth to children." "I will make your pain in childbearing "very severe "and with painful labor you will give birth to children." She's exempt, Sister. "And your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you." No girl is exempt. We haven't had this much excitement in a long time. Is it her arrival, or your return? This is just like hide and seek. Goodnight, girls. Goodnight, Your Excellency. Hey, you can't sleep here. What are you stupid? Charles, you can't be in here. Charles! You can't be in here! Don't worry, Shirley, I'll go get him. I'm heading that way anyway. Thank you, Doctor. Nurse! Um... excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. Hey, lady. You can't be here. The fuck... I know where she is. I'll take you to her. We'll... It's just a car. Okay, alright, we'll be there soon! We'll be there soon! No! Fuck! We need outside help to find her. She's out there, alone. It's my fault, I should of... She may wander, but she is not lost. Come. Come pray with me. Dear Father. Watch over our lost child. Bring her home safely to us. That we may show her your way.

You are a special girl, aren't you? Yes, Bishop. Yes. The Devil inside me... how will God get it out? If you work very hard on your Catechism class, after confession, if the Devil is in there, God will get him out. Okay? Okay. Thank you, Bishop. And you will tell everyone when he's gone, won't you?

This is a very important test... to keep away the Devil. Yes, Your Excellency. Okay. Well then, let's start the test, shall we? What did the world look like before original sin? Our first parents were holy and just... and so God wouldn't let them suffer or die. He gave them "Divine Intimacy". They were safe with God, weren't they? That's good, and do you know why he gave them Divine Intimacy? - Um... - It's okay, it's okay, because they were innocent. That's why. They were innocent, like you. Innocent, and naked, weren't they? Come then... show me what that would look like. If God were to see you without any clothes on, without any shame, that would make him very happy, wouldn't it? What's that? It's the Devil. You're scared, too? Why do you think that's the Devil? It killed Peggy, you said you'd take it out. Cover yourself. Cover yourself, I don't ever want to see you in here again. I got a friend now, I got a friend! And she gave me her suit. Ha! You worrying about something? It's God's will. - Jeez, you sound like the twins. If everything that happens to us lot is "God's will", then he's an asshole. Seriously, what's up? Oh fuck. What? God will save me. Not from that he won't. How did you know? How did you not know? Stoner. God will forgive me and I will be saved. Alright, you're the expert. - Coat hanger. - Knitting needle. Overdose of laxatives. Everybody knows that. You, you've got to speak more quieter. Or we can help push you down stairs. Our mom told us. She tried everything. Yeah. But God showed her. Here we are. Ignore Dumb and Dumber over there. You'll be fine. You'll be saved, so will your baby. No baby. You'll still have your baby. No. No, no, no... Oh, fucking hell. I will certainly die, I will certainly die! Please, please be quiet. They'll hear you. You're not going to die. Your immersion in the waters symbolizes your choice to let your carnal nature die. When you believe you are marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession to the praise of his glory. Sister Jennifer, why aren't you filming this? You are baptized. In the name of the Father and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. What did you make her do? The sin of judgment. You can't make her do that. You can't! - I haven't touched her, Sister Grace will tell you. She's eight months along. None the less, it makes me very sad, to see how much resentment you have in your heart for me. You offered me forgiveness. The sin of contempt. I was a child! You were supposed to take care of me. You were a junkie and I did. You leave any girl alone long enough... and someone will take her or she'll whore herself out. It should be God... a man of God, who draws her first blood and leads her into obedience. You can understand that now, can't you? Now that you're an adult? Aren't you glad it was me? It could've been so much worse. I was kind, wasn't I? I was kind. You begged me. "If you don't tell anyone, Jenny. If you forgive me, I'll have the strength to resist", but you haven't. That's why they want to close down Philomena's, isn't it? I am a good man, Sister. You can't do this. I am a direct descendent of the apostles. A direct descendent of the apostles! You'll be excommunicated, before anybody hears a word of it. Excommunicated. The church is my family. I didn't touch her and I wouldn't. Her innocence, is long gone. You didn't tell anyone then because you knew it was your fault, that has not changed. You will return to the mission. What do you think of this one? This works? Yeah. Excuse me? Okay. - I don't have confessions. - Who was he? I knew him for five moons. The rocks catched him. He climbed them and they catched him. I saved him. He was mine. He made white blood. I never seen it before inside me. That when she made... When she made him red blood, and I cried. But he was dead. And I was still hungry. But it feels like... a sin. To eat when they smell of love. It felt like like a sin with Peggy, too. Was I bad... to eat? Do you think they're in heaven? Why did you come here? I didn't come here... she wanted hospital to make baby. I want it out. They took me to you... to God. Yup, you look like a ginger poodle. Arf, arf, arf. Come on, say it with me. Arf, arf, arf. Arf. Arf, arf, arf. Gift. I only wore it once, so... Thank you. You got this, Skinny. Awwwww. Awwwww! I always knew there was a conspiracy with the church. Shit Mona, everyone knows that. Is this kid really yours? Right. Well I got my own little Darlin' right here, that they're gonna have to listen to. Who the fuck gave Mona a gun? I'm not gonna shoot anybody. Isn't it hot though? You know they took Charity's little girl, too. They say they are gonna help raise your kid... no, they just took her. You cried like an animal. Made these little howls. I remember, Charity. Don't you remember? I'll go help you raise hell, honey. That's the spirit, Effie. Time for a reckoning. Aren't you tired of hiding? Charity? Yeah. I got it. I owe her already. I'm going. I'm tired of hiding! I got nowhere else to be. I'm tired, I'm tired of the cops and the guards, and the aliens, and the radiation and my own body, and the C.I.A., not to mention that! Mona, I think you got us already. - Right, let's do this. - Let's go. Welcome one and all to the First Holy Communion of our young ones today. A particular welcome to my boss, His Eminence The Cardinal of Cincinnati. I'm sure you'll be impressed with what you see today. And welcome to the ladies and gentlemen of the press. And welcome to the children. Don't our young girls look pretty today? And don't the boys look like fine young gentlemen? And these modern times, the work of the Devil can be seen in the proclivity for perversion among us and the Devil is wily, he can tempt those who are weak. But the church and you, it's righteous followers, we will not have it. We will not lose faith. See 'ya after your snack. You've now heard of the wild child that came to us just months ago, unschooled, vicious and mute. She could hardly have been called a girl when we first found her. But now she speaks the holy scriptures, baptized, and having confessed to her sins, she is ready to join the other children in being rewarded the body of Christ for the first time. The blood of our savior will finally bring her into forgiveness and purity. Amen. You are here to witness the power of that church. The power of God's mercy for his followers. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Take this all of you and eat of it. For this is my body which will be given up for you. Body of Christ. - Amen. - Body of Christ. - Amen. - Body of Christ. - Amen. Body of Christ. Amen. And now, please welcome our Eve, whom I've made my own personal Christian mission. When I first found her, she looked like this. But now... She's nervous, bless her little heart. Body of Christ. Open your mouth, child. Body of Christ. She doesn't want to! Sister Jennifer is having one of her episodes. You can't force her. This man abuses the children in his care! Sister Grace! Sister Grace, please remove Sister Jennifer. I am sorry. Body of Christ. It should be God, a man of God who draws their first blood as they bring them into obedience. You can understand that, now that you're an adult, can't you? I am sorry... in front of the children... it's disgusting! Get her out! Body of Christ. Shit, the baby's coming! Robert! I'm calling an ambulance now. We've come for Little Darlin'. Get them out! Yeah! What are you gonna do, huh? Oh, Hell no! Oh my God... Mona! Let's go! Let's go! Take her, take her.
