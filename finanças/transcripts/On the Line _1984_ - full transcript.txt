A new load for you. I don't know what you do with your shirts. Ask your cousins, Rosie. They tried to put holes in this one. What cousins? You don't make any sense. Hi. Here we are. I'm Chuck.

Great for him, but I can't sleep on hamburgers and Cokes. Two eggs over easy and some toast, please. - Coffee? - Glass of milk. And what will you have? No, that's for him.

You gonna teach him? Hey, somebody has to open up his eyes. [CHUCKLING] Your eggs will be ready in a second. So, do you think they'll let us go with you? You mean you want to join the force? Yeah. What else can you do around here? Not much. That's for damn sure. Well, we'll start out like you did, Uncle Willy. Join the force. If anything else comes along that's more exciting. You got your own business, right? MUSIC: He might break your heart. By the way Mom sends her best. Said she'll write to you. That's real nice of her, kid. [SIGHING] But listen, kid. There's some kind of misunderstanding here. I ain't got no nephew, no sister, and no business. But I can give you a hand. What's your uncle's name? Bryant. Willie Bryant. You must know him? Yeah, sure. He's not on patrol anymore. Add this to the shirts, Rosie. You stupid asshole. Why'd you have to tell him about me for? Bryant say he was going to meet you here today? He said he'll be here for sure on Thursday. Today is Thursday isn't it? You want to see him, right? CHUCK: Well, yeah. I think I know where he is. Great. That's fine. But I can't wear this where we're going. [MARIACHI MUSIC] Howdy. Hey. Kind of early isn't it? - Nope. Just about bedtime. Here we are in Mexico. What about that? What's that? Looks like a body. It's probably a dog. Mexicans say what floats downstream don't belong to nobody. Not to them. Not to us.

They day you take that hat off it's going to be crawling with alligators. [CHUCKLING] That's why I don't take it off. I don't blame you. Here's the report. Take a look. Mitch, don't you think there's something strange about this? I mean, they brought him across the border at other places at sunrise and they never took a shot at anybody. [PHONE RINGING] Stakes are higher. That's all. Why is that? [PHONE RINGING] Won't you let me look into it? MUSIC: But he'd find out. [HUMMING MUSICALLY] MUSIC: That he'd like to see me one more time. Well, here's the man. I wouldn't get the pants so tight next time if I were you. You guys are in too much of a hurry. There's always time to join up. We only did what you did. Yeah. I lost a lot of good years too. This here is rough country out here. It's not as tough as we are, eh, John? We got no time to lose. Oh, yeah? Well then, you might as well learn something about guns.

BRYANT: Jesus. Go to hell. [PHONE RINGING] For Christ's sake, Mitch, don't give me any more problems than I've already got. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] Good eye, kid. With the way things are going you'd be better off not having such a good eye. Just sign this and shut up. Why don't you get your ass out on the field and let's see how you handle it. My ass has been on the line and nobody ever got shot. If this boy dies we're in for big trouble. The Mexican consul's already called the attorney general. And the press is going to play this up big. Border patrol opens hunting season on Mexicans. And just what do you want us to do about it? For right now don't do anything. Just keep your mouth shut. Everybody's dismissed except Mitch. Come on. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hurry up. All right, let's go. [SPANISH] Come on. [SPEAKING SPANISH] All right, come on. All right, you all got a quarter? It's only 25 cents now. Come on, man, cheer up. You didn't break the law. nothing's going to happen. [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Sorry, friend, she's not available. What'd you say? You heard me. I want to talk to you. Hey, this girl is mine, boy. She's been drinking with me all day. I'll be back in a minute. What the hell is this all about? - You'll see. Engracia, I want you out of here. You don't belong in Boystown. - What? We're leaving tomorrow. I want you to come with us. And break my contact with the [SPANISH]?? You know what he did to get it? Besides the police would look for me all over. Hey, no one will look for you in America. But you're crazy. Why would I leave? What would I do, huh? Don't worry. Everything is going to work. [CHUCKLING] Look, nobody's looking. Come on, get inside. You'll never have to come back. No. I'm not leaving. There is nothing for me in your America. Besides, if I leave all this. I have to see a priest first. What? We don't have time for that. Engracia, I need you. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I'm sorry. We can go to the room for a while. Shit. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What happened? I'm broke. I spent all my money on the car. Well, I'll put it in your bill, OK? OK. I had word from patrol agent Mitchell that a tank truck was northbound on the highway. He gave a command to stop the truck. Did you know that undocumented aliens were inside the truck? No. No. I thought the driver was carrying contraband. Why didn't you think that aliens were inside? EDDIE: Because he didn't stop. Where you been, boy? Playing hooky? It seemed inconceivable to me that he would risk human life like that. But as you see they did. [MUFFLED TALKING] MAN: Border patrol pilot Frank Mitchell. 39 years old. 12 years of service. Divorced. Served as a pilot on the day of the incident. On the night of November 7th you give orders to shoot a tank truck traveling along Highway 83? No. I said it should be stopped. Doesn't it imply the same thing? Hardly. MAN: Who did the shooting? Can you identify yourself? Snyder. He's one of our trainees. He's going through practice exercises before he goes Academy next week for a period of two months. Does a trainee have permission to shoot a firearm? Only in self-defense. The truth is I fired the first shot. And? Well, I didn't hit the target. Mr. Mitchell, the smuggler Mr. William Bryant was a former patrol agent-- So what's happening? Aren't we going? Heard what he said? Then we're staying. Didn't his arrest as a smuggler give you a personal satisfaction? A settling of old scores? No, sir. I'm a professional. I was doing my job. Is it also your job to punch him in the stomach when he's handcuffed? We are not analyzing the Bryant case now. But we are analyzing the spirit in which patrol agent Mitchell carries out his duties. Maybe you are out to get Bryant and it was a matter of indifference to you whether the cargo in the tank truck was drugs or people or children. I object. That's right let's stick to the facts. Mr. Mitchell, you must admit your name is almost always connected with these border incidents. We're returning illegal aliens according to mutual agreement between Mexico and the US. If your border patrol took their job more seriously we would have fewer of these incidents. Are you asking for stronger repression? I don't think this is the time for personal opinions. What a shame. I was just about to ask Mr. Mitchell something personal. Go ahead. No, let's not bother. If all of you are through with me can I go? What's Up? I'm Schultz with the Texas Observer. Is there anything else you want to say? Would you mind telling me why in the hell an American law officer has to give explanations to foreigners? Would you repeat that for Mexican TV? - No, I wouldn't. - You mean you won't talk to us? Get out of my face. Hey, hey, cool it man. Cool it. - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - OK. It's all right now. [SPEAKING SPANISH] - How are you doing? - OK. Is everything OK? Yeah. Yeah, he'll be OK. Where are we going? Boystown. Those dirty Mexicans have been fucking us long enough. Now we're going to fuck them. Hey, I still have to testify. Don't worry. Nobody's going to ask you anything. Or don't you want to go with a real hard ass son of a bitch? It's just that I was there this afternoon. MITCH: [CHUCKLING] What do you know? Engracia won't mind. The more tricks the bigger the take. Mitch, I've really had enough today. At 21? Come on and get in. But I'm broke. We'll find a way. [GROANING] Mitch, wait. Son of a bitch. [CHUCKLING] What a bastard. You're something else, you know that? Jesus. [CHUCKLING] You got a bad case of pussy fever, kid. I understand 'cause she's got something special. You can't keep her to yourself so why not share her with a friend? It's got a nice kind of a ring to it. Like two buddies having a drink together. Yeah. But it'll be the last one 'cause I'm ready to close. Just leave the bottle and go on home. We're not going to get laid. We might as well get drunk. To Engracia. And us. [TENSE MUSIC] You know what I like about her? She doesn't like to do it, but she's a real pro. You know she starts out by faking it and she just gets caught up in it. Starts to liking it. Liking it and it loving it. At least that's the way she is with me. What's she like with you, kid? [CHUCKLING] What's the matter? You don't want to talk about it? Well, you're wrong. That's the best part of it. Talking about it afterwards. Not for me it isn't. Well, you're still a rookie. Gotta go. Hey, come on back. We still got a bottle to finish. I want to send a telegram. Yes to Mexico. Same number. No, I don't know her last name. She works at El Papillon. OK. I want to marry you. That's it. No, hold on. I will love you forever. Yes. Signed Charles Mathewson. MAN: You've got to do something to deserve it first. I mean-- It's almost time to pick up the body. Why did you have to make it so early? It's quiet, Castle. Less trouble that way. Excuse me. So what'd the council want? Nothing special. He's just playing his part. Yeah? What does he want? First money. They're asking for a million dollars to settle with the boy's family. [LAUGHING] Well, they're just asking. You know when we first started out-- Everything was different then. I know that. But things have changed. You're no fool. You know the whole thing is political. And second? Your head. Why me? They want you transferred. That's why. I wasn't even on the road that night. Yeah, but you got a reputation. So? Is that a crime? I'm just telling you what they want. You didn't sell me out did you? We gotta make them happy. Once we settle with the boy's family you're going to be right back on the job. I mean, hell, take a couple of weeks off. I wish I could. They don't want something else? Oh, there's a third condition, but it doesn't concern you. They're not going to get it anyway. You know you and your secrecies and your politics, you're fucking up the whole country. Mitch, it's exactly that kind of attitude that constantly gets you in trouble. Yeah, well when you work it out with your Mexican buddies give me a call. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] [ELECTRONIC BEEPING] ELECTRONIC VOICE: M-I-N-E. You are correct. MAN [ON TV] : [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN [ON TV] : [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] No, I won't. You mean you won't talk to us? Get out of my face. MAN [ON TV] : [SPEAKING SPANISH] [ELECTRONIC BEEPING] - [SPEAKING SPANISH] ELECTRONIC VOICE: R-O-N. That is incorrect. Engracia, [SPEAKING SPANISH]. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV IN SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Let's go to your room. I don't feel like going in there. I don't blame you, but I don't feel like being with such a famous man. Hey. What happens out there ain't got nothing to do with you and me. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hey. I said no. We got plenty to talk about you and me. Who told you to come into my room? Don't get angry. You're much too pretty. But you're going to leave for good? Yes. But now we're not going. Then I suppose you bring me the money, no? No, I came back for a much better reason. You know that. Yes, but you have to pay me first. OK? - Even today? [CHUCKLING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] What a way to start. That's all? Anyway, I don't think we are going to do anything today. What do you mean? I really shouldn't. I'm going to be married. To a very rich man from Chicago. - Oh, really? Yeah. He's crazy for me. Read it. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHING] You're nuts. You're happy because I marry another man? You're funny. The other guy is me. - You? - Yeah. Chucka, Chucka, Chuck and Charles Mathewson-- same person. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Why didn't you tell me? Why you make fun of me? Make fun of you? Yeah. Honey, you're the one who's been giving me a rough time. Listen, I love going to bed with you, but it's not enough. I need to have you. I want you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Are you really going to marry me? How else am I going to get you out of here? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MARIACHI MUSIC] MITCH: Hey, kid. What's this bullshit story I hear about you marrying Engracia? Yeah, I'm going to do it. Making a big mistake, kid. There ain't no changing a whore. If you weren't so drunk, Mitch, I'd get you for that. You are cunt struck. I'll admit she's a fancy fuck, but you can't marry every whore you go to bed with. [BOTTLE CLANGING] [THUMPING] [SCREAMING] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: It'll be all right. CHUCK: [GROANING] WOMAN: No, please. You bit off more than you can chew, kid. I pity you, Mitch. You sick bastard. Sick? MAN: Hey-- [CHATTERING] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: It's all over. MITCH: You little piece of shit. God damn it, let go of me. Let go! Where's my hat?

[CHUCKLING] [MARIACHI MUSIC] [CHATTERING IN SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Morning. US citizen? Thank you. What about you? Yeah. Is this the only document you have on her? Yeah. Why don't you follow me into the office for a moment? Charles Mathewson? Yes. And you and Miss Engracia Gomez just got married? Is that right? Yes. It's on there. Yep. The marriage is perfectly legal, but, uh-- But what? Mr. Mathewson, you're a border patrol trainee and according to US immigration law you cannot bring into the United States, as your wife, a Mexican woman under contract in the zone. You need a special waiver. You ought to know that. Let me talk to the officer in charge here. If you like. It's not going to change a thing. Come on. Hey, look, things have gotten a little botched up, OK? It's all confusion. No passing out on me. Why didn't you tell me you were [SPANISH]?? Sure I did. I must have. No, you didn't. And if they don't like me I don't like them too. Mr. Mathewson. Look, we'll talk about it later, OK? Just hold on. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Where's Engracia? She went that way. Engracia! Wait, where are you going? Leave me alone. I don't want to see you anymore. You're a liar. I want to be with my people. Don't be a fool. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Have you gone crazy? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hey, break it up. Break it up. Get off. Come on, get off of him. It's OK. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Chuck, come on. We gotta get back there in 10 hours. I'm not going back to the Academy. I won't join those bastards. You know they got us by the balls. We're stuck in the border patrol. I can't leave without my wife. [TIRES SCREECHING] [HORN HONKING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Muchas gracias. How much do I owe you? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHUCKLING] Lupe. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Look who's over there. So they satisfied that condition. They've been laid off, but still keep looking for us. Rings, bracelets, real silver. Want to try? [CHATTERING] We shall meet her. I think he wants something else. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] Real silver, madam? No? And you? Do you want something? No. Silver from Mexico? Sure. Sit down. What's the problem? They wouldn't let you back in Boystown? I have to get a divorce first. Looks like we're both on the team. But how long do you think they'll let you pick up guys off the street? The Zulies can play rough. Don't worry about it, eh? I do. If you treat me nice I can get you back in the club. They made a deal. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [TENSE MUSIC] You heard from Chuck? I don't want to talk about it. He's a good kid. He just has to grow up. So, why didn't he tell me he works with the [SPANISH]?? Well, people don't exactly love us. I guess he figured you wouldn't think he was so adorable. I don't. Listen, somebody has to do the dirty work. For instance, you don't like me, but I pay you good. Don't you get a certain satisfaction out of doing something you don't like and knowing you do it better than anybody else? [DOOR THUDDING] MAN: Concerning agreements-- Hey, I got some important business in Mexico. I gotta go down there this weekend. With your car in Mexico? I'd spend the whole time without wheels. Not if we take turns. It's your business. Not mine. MAN: Next deal with-- All right, I'll go alone, but I'll need some bucks. What, do I look rich to you? I Know, but you got the extra check. MAN: Mathewson. You're not paying attention. Can you give us the main points of the 1898 Immigration Act? I'll have to refresh my memory, sir. Well, we have a nice long weekend coming up. So why don't you prepare a report on it for next Tuesday? Sure. [LAUGHING] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Do you like it? [SPEAKING SPANISH] I want to talk to you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What do you want? I said I want to talk to you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] She's my wife. [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] I thought I'd never see you again. And I didn't expect to see you back in Boystown. Well, here is safer. Engracia, listen to me. You and I are not guilty of anything. We're not going to let all this shit of Boystown and the border destroy our happiness. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CHUCKLING] Back again. You guys are fast, huh? You got it. [THUMPING] [THUMPING] [GROANING] Welcome to America. Come on, you gotta hurry up. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Listen, I've been thinking. We'll rent an apartment near the Academy. Then I can be with you on weekends. It's only for three weeks and I'll ask for an assignment where no one knows us. What do you think? What? I love you. You want to repeat that? Yes. Yes, I love you. Oh god. I can't believe she finally said it. [HORN HONKING] She finally said it! [TIRES SCREECHING] [MARIACHI MUSIC] [SINGING IN SPANISH] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [SINGING IN SPANISH] Hey. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SINGING IN SPANISH] ENGRACIA: Hey. CHUCK: Be good, baby. ENGRACIA: [CHUCKLING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [ELECTRONIC BEEPING] ELECTRONIC VOICE: L-G-E-E-N. That is correct. [WASHING MACHINE RUMBLING] Baby, you got troubles and you don't even know it. [CHUCKLING] So you finally made it to America. You know, kid hasn't used his brains once. Brings you to the cheapest place in the nearest town. Go away, Mitch. And now what? You're going to sit here and wait until somebody finds out your wetback and they ship you back across the border? I said go away. I'm a married woman now and this is my home. Fucking home. You don't even know how to use this fucking thing. How long do you think he's going to stay married to a Mexican whore? [THWACKING] I don't want to hurt you. I like you. You know that. Why can't it be the way it was? Go away, [SPANISH]! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Now, now. OK. But if I were you I would think about it. When the border patrol was formed 60 years ago the motto they adopted then still rings true today. Simply put, their motto was on honor first. Honor to your country. Honor to her principles. Honor to your fellow man. Honor the country whose borders you are protecting. Honor the principles which have made her the bastion of freedom. Honor the equality of all men and women whether white, brown, or black, citizens, immigrants, or aliens. The border patrol from its humble beginnings has had a long, colorful, and proud history. It expects the best from its officers. It is a tradition of the patrol for each officer to meet the highest professional standards, courage, and humanity. The border patrol is in charge of guarding some 8,000 miles of America's international boundaries. Few officers realize-- [KNOCKING ON DOOR] To our neighbors in the south and north-- Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you. We're just checking out a complaint. Would you show us some personal identifications? [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN [ON RADIO]: Our nation will be judged first hand-- [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN [ON RADIO]: By your conduct. He works with you. He's in the Academy. He'll be here very soon. We know. Just pack a small bag ma'am and come with us. We will be in touch with your husband. OK. [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN [ON RADIO]: We have another fine class of professionals. 30 young men from many backgrounds. All dedicated to maintain, uphold the dignity and honor of the service. ELECTRONIC VOICE: N-O-R. MAN [ON RADIO]: These young officers about to graduate and enter the field are part of that proud tradition that began more than half a century ago in El Paso, Texas. The border patrol was first-- [MARCHING BAND MUSIC] Chuck! What a surprise. You sure have grown up. Hear that? I can't believe my eyes. Oh, here. It's from your mom. She's very happy as we all are. It's your cheesecake. How are you, Reverend Snyder? Chuck. Well, I was about to leave. I must report immediately. My car's really on its last legs. Very well, but before Jonathan's father has something to do. You've grown up together and you're starting out together. Let us pray. May I ask God to bless you and pray that he grant you success and fulfillment as officers of peace. In Jesus' name, amen. MAN [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Patrolman Mathewson report to the director's office. Excuse me. MAN [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Patrolman Charles Mathewson. Let me make this clear. I'm not in charge of your case. I'm merely informing you that you are accused of smuggling aliens and that you now must go on suspension without pay. Does this mean you're quitting? You can take it as you want. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Chuck. [CRYING] It's OK. I'm here. [SPEAKING SPANISH] You didn't think I'd let you down. No. But I was afraid they'd hit you or put you in jail. It wouldn't matter. I'd always come back for you. No. Then I would never see you again. I don't get it. How'd they find where we live so fast and that you were there? Did they say anything? No. MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHEERING ON RADIO] [MUFFLED TALKING ON RADIO] Boy. Big surprise, huh? - Yeah. How did you, uh-- Ask the magician. You were the third condition. That's all. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Join us? CHUCK: Not tonight. Thanks. Yeah. Since your friend screwed me up I can't cheat at cards anymore. MAN: [CHUCKLING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] OK. I think you're bluffing. What are you going to do now? Wait for the trial I guess. What else can I do? You and me sure don't have the same blood, kid. They fucked him over. It wasn't they. It was he. Wouldn't let his wife into the country. Deported her. Arrested him. He's still going to go back. MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: I'll take two. Don't you think we could find anything here? MAN: Sure. This is the real land of opportunity, especially for a gringo. [CHUCKLING] Maybe we can help you if you help us. MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] BRYANT: Well, I'll see you. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] The cards, gentlemen. MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] Things look different from here don't they? Uh-huh. All these people want is to go to the states and make a decent living. I see nothing wrong with that. Oh. Oh. Oh. No, no, kid. The idea is you draw attention to one point in the river while we work another point that's all. Provide cover? Yeah, that's right. We deal in people and goods. Poor old, Mitch, he always goes to the bait. Yeah, but I'm still with the border patrol. It could be dangerous for me. Nah, you'll be all right. You just stay on this side and keep us posted, that's all. Nice girl. Did you ever think we'd end up as uncle and niece, huh? [CHUCKLES] - We'll see you. - So long, kid. Did you see it? Huh? 200,000 for a Mexican boy. So how much is our trip? Paperboy. [TALKING DROWN OUT BY AIRPLANE PUTTERING] Tonight we're going bear hunting. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Well, well, I heard a wetback. Car 40, who am I talking to? Hoover. MITCH [ON RADIO]: Where are you? On 83 near Santa Santo. MITCH [ON RADIO]: There's group at Las Pasos. Get over there. Right, Mitch. [SIRENS BLARING] MITCH [ON RADIO]: Stevens? What's up, Mitch? MITCH [ON RADIO]: Drive to 83 and keep in contact with Hoover. We're going to get our ducks lined up. OK. [SIRENS BLARING] MAN: [SHOUTING] Mitch is back so the patrol cars have gotta be right behind him. So are we. Not again. Bull crap. Get out and push it. MITCH [ON RADIO]: Watch this, a little night swim? [SHOUTING SPANISH] Come on. They're coming! MAN: The current's too strong. Most of them can't swim. They're all gonna drown. Hang on. Hold on to me. [AIRPLANE ENGINE BUZZING] Mitch, it's me! It's me! Bastard! Come on. Come on. Grab hold. Come on, I got you. We're almost to the American side. Hold on. A few more feet. Come on you son of a bitch.

Chuck, you hear me? We made it. Chuck? We made it. [SPEAKING SPANISH] OK. [MUFFLED SPEAKING ON POLICE RADIO] Go ahead. [MUFFLED SPEAKING ON POLICE RADIO] Would you do me a favor? Tell Engracia not to go back to Boystown. Chuck. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHING] [CHATTERING] [LAUGHING] [CHATTERING] WOMAN: [LAUGHING] Hi. What? How you feeling? I don't want to think about it. That's good. Can I buy you a drink? I don't work here anymore. OK. Let's go. That's my girl. That's my girl. You don't need him.

Try again. ENGRACIA [VOICEOVER]: Thrown into the Rio Grande. As American's say what goes downstream belongs to nobody my love for you is-- ELECTRONIC VOICE: F-O-R-E-V-E-R.
