Transcript by sub.Trader & Clarity In between breath, take the shot. That was... I was hoping we wouldn't have to deal with this scenario so early in our lessons. There is unfinished business you need to tend to. It's tempting to let nature run its course. Lungs will fill with blood. Animals die of natural death but with that process comes extreme pain. This isn't right to let an animal suffer for a... Hey. Zoe. Here. Let me help you. Slow down honey, it's not a race. Isn't it? Aren't we getting close to seeing your prom? Mom. - You have anyone in your sights? - I mean it. Stop. Stop what? Was just talking to a... fly. You've done really good out there, kid. I mean, the size of that deer, we're gonna be eating venison all summer. - All in a days work. - Yeah. And all before 0800. Yeah. Coffee. Hey, Lewis can wait a minute, huh? For what? I think we need to see somebody again. And by we, you mean me? No, I mean us. Listen. Everyday still feels like it just happened. And honey, you are so angry. You are so... - not! - Hey. That look in your eyes. Guys in my unit had that look. Not everything is about the war. You're cutting yourself off from everything you care about. And you're so guarded all the time-- Maybe there's a brochure you can give me so I can go? You're 17 years old and you gave up your cell phone? Well, think of all the money you've saved. Take off my jacket. You go out into the word without that jacket. Should be easy for you if you're really not at war. Sorry, not breaking, just entering. - I did knock. - Yeah. It's cool. I'm ready. Lewis. - Morning, Mr. Hull. - Morning. You know, back there with your Dad I totally saved you intentionally. You intentionally saved me? Oh yeah. I mean it was a calculated risk, but... Really? Explain. Well, number one: you were saying how things are getting more and more heated between you and your pops lately. And "B". You know you were... You started with numbers but continue. And two: you usually come out right when I honk, but when you didn't, I assumed that maybe he had you cornered and so... I engaged. You engaged? - I mean that's how he would say it, right? - You engaged, yeah. What the hell? Rory Mocun, Chaz Harting. And AJ Turners in the back, like an asshole casserole. They're like roaming soldiers who don't realize that their empire is crumbling in just a few days. Or they do realize it and they are totally freaking out. Okay, that just like, looks like one of their faces. Hello! You freaks fucking or what? Hey, we know that you're hurting, Roy. OK? We know Mommy, she didn't hug you enough. And Daddy never said he was proud. We don't need to hide behind stereotypical cave male aggression. We reach out to that scared little boy inside, don't push him away. They are actually pushing us off the road now. Thanks guys. Stay well. Why am I always this guy, huh? Guy who pulls into the dirt... Because you're smart and safe. - Yeah, well... - And not a total asshole. I hate that about me. Is that Chris Jelick over there? Is he doing something completely fucking weird? - Yeah. - Then yes. It's fine, just let it rest a minute. Yeah, now, that's Chris Jelick. 'Cause that is definitely Tristan Voy's rapemobile. We'll see all kinds of dumb stuff today. What do you mean? Hello? Senior prank day. So the swim captain will have Thai food delivered to class and Becky Vaughn will set up her home-made slip'n'slide near the auditorium. And someone with a tiny car will try to park it inside the lobby. God, and even stupider turn of promposals. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Right. Ew. - You can try it now. - What? Like..? The engine. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, what is this, middle school? Fuck. This is bullshit. Giant person. When I'm in pictures. Even though I'm actually really small. But no one needs to know that. Bye now. Wait. Where are you going? Your locker is this way. Yeah, I know where my locker's at. Didn't you hear the bell? Your locker is by the Yearbook office and I need your eye for some new layouts. - Okay, can it wait till after lunch? - Yeah, of course. - You're being really weird. - I'm just stressed out. Maybe I should've never agreed to edit the damn thing-- Okay, look. Just remember, Lewis, this is High School. Nothing that happens here matters in the real world. Got it? - Yeah. - Good. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Bye. Yo, tell me if this sucks. - Is that you? - Yeah. - Who's harmonizing with you? - Also me. I got a new track out. I want this played at my funeral. - We're recording EP this summer. - No way! Yeah, I'll give the gym a shot before reality kicks me in the cootch. Nice. You know I'll come cheer you on. How else can I justify my 50% as your manager? - 50%? - 50%. Is there a lawyer in here? Are you a lawyer? Are you a lawyer? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not in the best of moods. Okay? I have not had my morning coffee because the teacher's lounge was filled from floor to ceiling with balloons. Ha. Ha. Ha. Get it out of your system. All right now, the rest of the time that we'll spend here together let's actually try and learn something. So, should we open up our books at page - One twenty... - Freeze, scholar. Whatever it is just make it quick please. Thank you. My maiden, will thou accompany me to the promenade? - Yes! - Huzzah! Very cute. We all have dates. Now let's shimmer down and get back to business. Okay. That was pure oxygen. Makes a loud noise, right? But no flame, or heat. This balloon however is filled with 100% hydrogen. And an explosion of that type. Because all three combustion requirements were present. Flame from the match. Oxygen from the atmosphere. And fuel from the... hydrogen. Zoe, can I have a word with you, please? Thank you, Mrs. C. Okay. Listen, I know you've been going through a lot. But maybe getting involved again could feel good? You want me to explode next time? I just don't like seeing a bright young woman who used to love my class fade into the background. No, I'm about to graduate and leave all of this behind. I've been accepted to Purdue for the fall-- Yes, I remember. I wrote a glowing recommendation. Perhaps that was premature? Perhaps it was. But like everyone keeps telling me, Mrs. Crawford, you can't change the past. Your attention please. Band practice will not be held in the auditorium today but will instead move to room 112. Thank you. Roses are Red. Violets are Blue. You didn't ask me, so I'm asking you. Prom? "We believe we can change things in accordance with our desires. We believe it because otherwise we'd see no favorable outcome. We don't think of the outcome which generally comes to pass, that we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change becomes unimportant to us. We've failed to surmount the obstacle but life took us around it, and led us beyond it, and if we turn the gaze into the past we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become." How cool is that? And when Marcel Proust finally finished this novel in 1922 he died, the very same day. Nothing? Okay. OK. Hello. What time is this? All right. Cool. If you could bring me a note, okay? It's a Countywide Policy, just bring me a note from the doctor. Hey, what time does your lunch start? - Directly after at lunch. - Very cool. - 12:35. - Very cool. Cool. - Thanks. Thank you. - Yeah. Yes, ma'am, I'm listening. How is the pizza? Have you ever eaten a dryer sheet? Gross. Okay. Okay, so I'm thinking you've been to your locker and you're taking it wrong. How should I take it? Like a goof, like a light-hearted friend thing. We'll go and will make fun of people together. Is that your dream prom night? You wanna spend money on a limo and tux and the wrist flower thingy just to do what we do every day? You pay for your own thingy, but... - Forget it. You're right. - I just... I can't. Yes. It'd be too soon and you know, I don't wanna... What? You know like with your mom and everything we should just-- This isn't about my mom. God, why do you have to do this right now? You were the only good thing, Lewis, it's so-- You're not being with everyone else. Alright? Don't shut up on me too. I was just... - You think I'm shut down? - No. Yes, but it's like it's not your fault. You're just... - Jesus! Dammit! - I'm sorry. Look, this is all like coming sideways. Can you just... I'm just going to the bathroom. When you come back can we just hit refresh and pretend I don't suck. Hey, did you lose something in here? Shit. Hey, you got studs on, girlfriend. Bitch. That did not look like a win, bro. Hey, no. Don't sit there. She's coming right back. - So I'm friends with your ma? - Just leave. Hey, I'm Switzerland. Don't take it out on me. Look, we're right in the middle of it. All right? Just go. Go! Fine. My mom's gonna want all those fake flowers back. And the ribbon too. Little rough on him, weren't you? It's a boundary issue. I agree. You have way too many. I like Lewis. Don't wanna lead him on, end up hurting him. He's just trying to make a memory with you, sweetie. I'm so closed to getting out of here. Few more months.

I love you. Okay, Dwan, did you mom say that she was gonna call the police? Look at me. Look at me. It's okay if she did. Did she? Yeah? She's a good mom.

Knowing you must be close. I'm looking for the thing that made that sound. Brenda, honey? Needing you to come out now. Here. I'm here. You should be ashamed. Brenda, honey, what's happening now? Were those gunshots? Brenda? Yeah, I killed that thing of yours. Where's my fucking-- All right, kiddos. That's it. That's time. Put your pencils down. End the calls, send the texts. Do what you gotta do but I need your absolute silence now. Please. I promise, do you think I'm gonna hang up on you. But I can't. I can't... Move, please. Come on. Move. Jesus. Bradley? Son? Hi, this is Tristan, I'm sending my thoughts and prayers to you during this difficult time. Vernon Central High School, how may I help you? I'm calling to help you, actually. Really? I could use some today. Aren't you cute? Okay, you have a live shooting situation in the cafeteria. This isn't a joke, okay? There are students with weapons in a lunch room right now. And you know this how? Because you are one of the students in our cafeteria with a firearm? Let's get more specific. I'm Tristan Voy. And you say your name is Tristan Voy? Keep talking. You with me. What are you hoping to gain from this, Tristan? Hope's got nothing to do with it. Thank you. He hung up. I'm calling 911. When experts look back on this day they will agree that she should've announced lock down over the intercom immediately. However the rule states that she must first confirm the information. How do I know this? Because they publicly vote on this shit at the school board meetings. That's how. Okay? So while we wait for this ill-advised staff I want you all to pull out whichever app you use to do live streaming video: Instagram, Facebook, Periscope. It does not matter to me, all right? Just get them up and running and point it at me. Now! Hey! You! - Zoe? - All of you. Stop! - Stop! Stop! - Hey. Tristan Voy and Chris Jelick have guns in the cafeteria. They are killing people. It's not even funny. No shit! Don't go back inside unless you wanna die, okay? Go! It's better be real. You are not coming? No. Most of them still don't know. Okay? I'm with you. - Okay. - Yeah? Yeah. Come on. My name is Tristan Voy and you are watching a live take down of Vernon Central High School. At first, I would like to give a quick shutout to the tech giants hosting these video streams. Turn them off, or in any way interrupt them and we will be forced to kill everybody immediately. I promise. So join me as we dismantle a bastion of our society in favor of entropy and truth. Well, well, well. If it isn't our friendly old neighborhood security guard. As if it's not sad enough that they are only paying him $12/h to protect our school. They expect you to do it without a fucking gun? Tristan! Oh, Jesus Christ. - Yes? - I'm unarmed. Sure, except for your normally cutting remarks, but please. What can I do for you? Your grievances with me, not your classmates. No shit? Do tell. Please. You were sent to my office twice last week. That's right. And I threatened you. I threatened you with expulsion. That's also right. Instead of trying harder to understand you. You know behind your desk you have this poster, and it says: "Making a difference, once student at a time." He didn't make time for me. I let you down, man. But you got my undivided attention now. On your desk, there's a picture of you, and your wife and your two kids. Where is that? That's at out camp in Broken Bow. I've never seen a family so happy. Made me wish that I could have that someday. - You absolutely can! - Wow! I can have your cabin? - Sure. - Okay, great. - So you heard that, right? - End this now. - And we'll make it happen. - Everybody heard that. Perhaps I can fuck your wife on the beach while your kids watch too, huh? You see, last week I wanted to come to your office twice, man. During our morning session I grabbed your keys, I went downtown, I had a copy made. And during our afternoon session while you were looking out the window talking about how guys like me would never amount to anything. You remember that? I replaced them. - Tristan. - Rob. Whatever your reasons are for doing this, man, we can work it out between us. Maybe we can. No! No. Please! - Get up! - Please! Don't bother. Phase two is about to begin. What did the Texans have? Grinding determination. But very little in a way of ammunition. What we wanna point out is... A hundred-- - You have to get out now! - Come on! Mrs. Greene, Mrs. Greene, you have to open the window please! - Please! - No, no! Thank you ladies, very clever. Where was I? In the corner of your screen there should be a number, perhaps next to an eyeball icon. Who here has more than 50 live viewers right now? Raise your hands please. Okay, great. That's great. Who has more than 100 live viewers? 500? How many do you have? Just went over a thousand. Goddamn, get up here. What makes you so popular? - I'm not, I'm-- - He does the Yearbook. Ah, the geeky newsboy. Well, actually I'm the admin of the Vernon High Page. Look, nobody asked for your life story, all right? I don't care where they are coming from, as long as they are watching. You are my main camera now, so please stay close. And everybody else please put you phone in a bin as it comes around I have a new task for you. I need to see your work, people. You can't just Google-- Oh my God! Ms. Hull! Inappropriate! What in the name of-- We're under attack. Some students have guns in the cafeteria. - This isn't a senior prank. - Everybody has to get out now. Josh, lock the door. Okay, come on, we don't have much time. Okay, everyone over here now. Single file line. - Where do I go? - Ladies first. Into the woods. Stay until the cops come. You're good. And make sure they're out if you can. - Single file. - Good. Mr. Yates? Yeah. I got you. One leg at a time. Oh my Lord. - They recorded this? - No, it's live. Happening now. - How did you find this? - It's on the school social page. Lewis. It's not that hard to build a wall. Tristan. Coming. - Are we famous yet? - Not yet. Okay. Yes? Permission to kill these? They're useless. Please, you've hurt her enough. Have you heard of operation T4? Hitler ordered mercy killings on the disabled because he didn't want their deformities to infect the master race. Good thing is... We're not Nazis. This is gonna take too long. Should I warn another class? I don't know, I just... You all right? Got this. Okay. What the hell? Relax. All right? It's early. But not unexpected. Anna, can you please figure this out for me? - Copy that. - Keep it moving! I'm on it. Leave it all and line up. Thank you. Isabelle, leave your purse. It will still be here when you get back. What the hell are you doing, Missy? I think that I have a pass here somewhere. For the electrical room? Nobody but me is allowed in it. What the hell does that mean? Did they get to it somehow? I don't know. What's going on? Pranking? Okay. All right. False alarm everyone. Back in your classrooms. You're not getting away that easy. Come on! You wanna die? Go! - Come on. - Okay. Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Maybe if I can get to the office I can make an announcement. Wait, Zoe! I should be the one to do that. Sheriff, if someone shooting at the school-- You're right. If it's an active shooter we go in immediately. This fucker holds the kids at gunpoint. Wait, Tom, if you telling me these kids are calling their parents from inside the school and saying that they are being held by-- I know you're not afraid to go in. I wanna go in. But... it's just... Look, let me finish! If this is more of a hostage situation than an active shooter then we contain, negotiate, and wait for the lead team before all else fails. Final projects are due in a few days. Really impressed with the work I've been seeing. Oh, Goodness. Hopefully you guys have saved your work. Get outside! Get outside! There's school shooting. Let's go! - Fuck! - Oh, shit. Let's go! Fuck! Fuck you, Becky! Sheriff, I'm a mile away, you can't tell me not to go in. Listen to me, Tommy. If it sounds like I'm pulling rank on you it's because I am. Now Vernon is your town but it's my county, okay? You're not the whose with family in there. Yes. I hear you, Tommy. I know your nephew's in there. But you if you have fast an entry team you gonna get everybody killed. Now I'm two minutes away. Just, hold out for just a goddamn minute. We could...Tom? Tommy? Son of a bitch! He hung up? He's hellbent on going in immediately. Here. Get us the hell outta here, will you? Let's go. Go. - Surely they all follow it. - Yes, we see them. Okay, they're gonna keep their lights and sirens off until we know if it's real. - It's real. - Okay. We have confirmation. There are active shooters in the building. They killed Rob. Yes. I'm here. I just... I need to... make a lock down announcement as quickly as possible? Yes, we'll keep the line open. Take this. Okay. Attention, faculty and students. We are in lock down. I repeat we are in lock down. Please just follow your school safety manuals for instructions as we put it in the lock down until further notice. Thank you. Officer, is there anything else we should be doing right now? Hey, you need to slow down! I'm not the problem, okay? They are at the cafeteria. We know that! Get back to your home room and stay put until-- Oh, shit. Fuck. Guys, everyone all right? - Yes. - All right. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Lock down means we stay put, lock the door. Emma, can you lock the door please? Close the window blinds. Get against the wall that isn't in view. Everyone go to that wall. And keep quiet. That's it. Come on in. Keep coming. File in. Hey, we're okay. It's all right. If the office announces the lock down then they're on it. Police have been notified. This is Tarsy. I need all available units to Vernon Central High... - Sir! Sir! - Good Christ! Tommy! - Tom, you read me? - There are officers down, we need medics. Police are here. Some lady cop's calling for an ambulance. Nice! Yes! The phase three begins. And? We just got teased on the Channel 2 News. Are they airing our stream yet? No. The anchor said they plan to go live from out-front. Hello, this is live from inside. Nobody wants to see your bullshit reporter. They want to see me. I'm finished in the basement. Awaiting for the orders. Great work. Do some reckon on the office on your way back. I wanna see how we did. Let the sheriff know we've got the remnants of the home-made bomb here. If somebody wanted to keep us busy and clogged the roads. Understood. I'll let him know. Williams, have you set the perimeter? Nobody does shit around here without my say so! What the hell is going on in here? Sheriff! Sheriff! You have to see this. All right. Come on everybody! Let's go! Away from the school! Hey! Hey! Okay, we need to get out of here. Not as painful as it looks. In fact... When it happens fast there's often no pain at all. Suddenly you're the expert on death? You only did it once. Yes. I'm a quick study. You got that from me. Yeah. Going through people's pockets, that you got from your dad. I need a phone. Always have known exactly what you wanted. Even as a baby. You wanna talk pain? - Breastfeeding you was a-- - Mom. No, it was a nightmare. But I admire it. Do I close his eyes? Well, he's not here anymore, sweetie. He's free of all attachments now. Is that how you feel? Almost. I still got one person who's holding on. Someone who's not quite ready to release me just yet. Definitely success. Maybe even better than expected. Pictures are worth a thousands words, my darling. And video, even more. This is for stealing all my weed. Begin sweeping the rooms. Top down. 10-4. And standby for the pics. Sit! Miss? Do you believe in God? Yes. Huh? Now why would God let something like this happen to you? Oh, Anna. Is it just me or it's hot in here? This is for stealing all my weed. Nice. Free will. God allows the wicked to do their wickedness. Oh yeah? Why is that? So they can be judged. Channel 5 just interrupted their programming. They're warning viewers about graphic content because they are about to air the live stream. Hot dog. You got the con. Okay? We need more bodies so we'll be right back. You two are coming with me. Let's move. Hey! If anyone is in there you need to get out of there. Okay? They gonna come looking for you. Just break the window. Get out if you can. Fuck. Hey! If anyone is in there you shouldn't hide in the rooms. They gonna come looking for you. - Are you a staff member? - No. Hey, look. They are in the cafeteria now. But I think they wanted a lock down. And it makes it easier to round everybody up that way. Break the window. Get out if you can. We're not supposed to leave until the office announces that it's over. No, you don't understand. There is no office anymore. Fuck! Fuck! Run. Hola! Don't worry amigos. For those of you just joining us this is school shooting. Tristan? Ms. Nunez, how are you? I'm gonna need to take everybody down to the cafeteria. La cafeteria. Is that right? Please don't hurt anyone. You know it's the one thing I've always really liked about you, Ms. Nunez, you really genuinely care about your students. Another thing I like is... You know you have this way of turning to write on the board it really holds the young man's attention. Tristan, please don't... Hey, por favor! Ms. Nunez, this is a Spanish-speaking classroom. You are beautiful. And you know what, for you... I think I can promise that I won't hurt anybody if you can do something for me. Qu?tate la blusa. Oh my God! Let go! Let go! Fuck you! Ms. Nunez. It's okay, Kitty. What, do you think I'm a child? Everything. Wow. You know you really are the nicest teacher-- Tristan. I have a few questions for you. I turned on the live comments feature and it's blowing up. People are really interested in-- Did I tell you to do that? - No, I'm sorry. - No. I'll turn it off. What kind of questions are they asking? Don't wanna get your hands dirty, huh? Miss Voy! Hello! Hey, is that you calling in on the land line? Yeah. Is there a car on the drive? It's not. There is a TV on, but they believe ma is off the town. SWAT team's still 30 away. They were on their way up to North responding to the bullshit bomb threats somebody called in. These jackass look three steps ahead of us. Look around and see if there is a back door. Roger that. Miss Voy! He's shooting up a school live on the internet, but giving me his number will violet his privacy? What? Second floor plans. Hey, do we even got a warrant for this? No. No time. That's why I'm calling what you're now doing a wellness check. Roger that. Miss Voy! Okay. How long did it take for you to plan? Fourteen months or so, I really... To make it sane. Between researching the blueprints of the building, gathering the tech, weaponry etc. How did you get the idea to do this? I didn't get the idea. So much, as the idea got me. You know, it reached out and grabbed me by the neck. And it hasn't let go. Quite frankly. Miss Voy! ...we are also waiting for a SWAT team just now en route... It's officer Banks. I got eyes on Miss Voy. She ain't gonna be helping you talk to her son. Breaking in here folks with some very disturbing news out of Vernon Central High School. There are multiple confirmed reports of an active shooting situation. We know that hostages are being held... Come here! Listen up! Anybody inside my perimeter from now on must gear up, okay? We've already lost two good officers. So tactical vest and helmets, right now. Let's go. No, he left me in charge. Not you. No. This is my body. No. From what I can tell, it looks like they are getting ready to enter the school. They are armoring up, not quite sure, but from what it looks like they are preparing to enter the school. Trunks are being opened. They are loading their weapons and vests are being deployed. A full scale seize approach is risky but it could make sense from the... Any reason for committing such a violent-- Shut up. Okay. You're okay. Your vest caught it. You're okay! Let's go, Bill. Come on. Back! Chris. Christopher, answer me. Tristan? Who the fuck else would it be? They tried to escape. I didn't kill without permission. Okay. Relax. Relax. I'm hearing the chors again... They found me here somehow. You know they aren't real. Right, buddy? Hold on. I'm coming down because apparently I have to do everything myself. Give me your extra piece. Well. It's funny when you are holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Everybody to the cafeteria. Now! Two by two, please. And we are behind. So I'm gonna take this group down, you go collect more. We're the number 1 trending topic online. About damn time. Well, get to it! What are you guys doing? Let's move! To the cafeteria, now! Keep the camera pointed at them. Please. Keep it moving. One foot after the other. Keep it moving. Find some floor. Make yourself at home. - I'm sorry. - I know. I know. - They always try to take over. - I know. They are gone now, right? Yes? Because you're here. I'm here. No. Not right now, okay? There is still a lot to get done. You don't love me anymore? - You've moved on my sister. - I love you and Anna both equally. Okay? Now fucking medicate man. Get yourself together, there's still a lot to get done. Get in. Come on. Anna. Where are you? Hey, would you please report back? Tell me where you are. I did that, you bitch! Anna, what the fuck? Speak. Knock 'em dead, sweetie. It's... It's funny cause it's... it's a theater. Your hair. Yeah. Do you like it? So, you obviously met me when you said someone was holding you back. But you're wrong. You died, there is nothing I can do to change that. Well. You said yourself. I only died once. Right? Right. But how many times did I die in your mind since then? How often do you think of that day? But you don't really see me anymore, sweetie. You just see the monster that got me. I can't help it. Well, you can. Look at me now. That deep place inside of you. Your will to live is getting stronger. And it's letting me live again too. - The way I really want. - Jesus! You hear voices too? Maybe. What's your excuse? Really? God! You agreed to be a part of this and it doesn't even mean anything to you? It's even more disgusting. Tristan called it a reckoning. A reckoning? For what? You're a kid! I'm eighteen. You're pathetic, is what you are. What did you know about me? Before all this? Nothing. You are incredibly forgettable. Come on. Come on! God, what are you fishing for, Kip? Sixth grade. Chloe Paul and AJ Turner sneak up and pulled my pants down in front of assembly. But they also got my underwear. - That's what this is about? - Don't. Oh, sorry. Have I belittled your motivation for cold blooded murder? You just want me to say what you already know. Kip, I personally hope you rot in here. But a cop will probably find you. Eventually. Everyone laughed at me, naked! And it started years of people giggling near me. Behind me. So many veil jokes. Even from teachers. About my coming up short on homework. Do you ever think that the people you heard giggling were happy? And maybe teachers with no idea which words were triggering you just didn't wanna see you flunk? Not only... does this punishment not fit any crime, but Kip, most of these people are completely innocent. This girl, Amy Kim, died in my arms on the bathroom floor today. And all I know about her is that she liked horses. On these little ribbons for jumping them. How did she deserve to go like that? I'm a numbers guy. Sure. I would like to... look at my name on the scoreboard just like anyone. But never ever let it be said that playing video games leads to real life violence. It doesn't. Sudoku though... I mean... Come on, that is scary shit. Anyway, when you plan your very own mass shooting don't just go for the ** one of these like they all do. They don't have a set number in mind, they just... - They wanna be bigger... - Todd. and they wanna be better, so they just go in... Lauren, Lauren Cope. I used to cut your wife's hair before. Oh yeah, yeah, right. Thanks. I don't even know what the hell are we looking at in here. It's a live stream from inside the school. It's happening right now. I mean how can you hit a target if you are not aiming? Me, I've got a number. The number that I specially like. And I figure out how to get it. - Please Zoe. - No. No. I'm sorry. I'm not one of them. Okay? Okay. You guys, you need to get out of here right now. We're trying to. Claire says they are in the cafeteria. Chaz Harting getting... Okay. Good. Good. Come on. ...indecisive, helpless... Hello. Holy shit! Girl. Yeah, yeah. I'll find him. Give me one second. Sheriff. Sheriff. Hey. Do you remember that friend that I was telling you about. The one that saved all of our asses? She's calling from inside. Toss it. Let's go. Hello. Hello to you too. Look, Sheriff. An entire class will come out right now. But the shooters are watching our every move on the news. Okay. Hang in there. Let me see what I can do. Okay. As students inside are preparing for their greatest test yet one more failure could cost them their lives. Hey, don't put the school in the shot for a few minutes. - We have every right to do... - No. I know you do, but that nutcase is watching your broadcast. All right? So I know I can't make you so I am asking. Talk to the parents, interview the kids, anything but keep the school out of the shot, okay? I'm happy to not show the school. Well, good! I appreciate that. If you give me something better to point our camera at. We got it. How about a shot of me personally calling that asshole? Great. On speakerphone. Fast! Fast! I will take a large wine pizza. Easy on the cheese please as I am dairy sensitive. Is that what this is all about, Tristan, a lunch order? What I'm saying, Sheriff is that there is nothing you can do for me except watch me beat the game. The game is easy to win if you are the only one playing. Nothing about this was easy. All clear! All clear! Okay, police is just around these corners, go as fast as you can. Go! - Nice! - You're coming. Aren't you? No. Everyone's still in lock down. I'm gonna try to warn as many as I can, OK? Not alone, you are not. - Mrs Crawford. - Go everyone. Run! So you get to see where they are. Come on. Go. You are obviously very smart. Come on. And I don't need some local lard ass cop to tell me that. Fair enough, I could stand to lose a few Come on man, you are gonna work that angle to sensible negotiator who shares a bit of his own life? I don't care how close you are to... retirement or about your... beloved wife, who you lost, and now you understand anger too. My wife is just fine. I'm afraid I can't say the same about your mother. You paid her a visit, didn't you? Well, I hope she's still watching. I think if she watches all the way through, she will finally be proud. Barbara, it's Jane Crawford. Jane. Jane, we're in here. Oh, God! The rooms aren't safe. We have to get everyone out. Come on. Let's go. Hurry! This way. You see, Sheriff, I'm an agent of change. Midwife of the truth. I am an embodiment. That sounds exhausting. Yeah, it's because it hurts your tiny brain. Then why don't you explain it to me is that you are a small child? In a way that I have to explain everything to everyone? Yes. You really put me on the spot sheriff. But I'll give it a try. I could have the people in this room do the most vile things to each other in order to stay alive. And they would. Right? That doesn't interest me. See, humanity is a joke, and you my friend are the punch line. You are the sheep, and I am the Shephard. And I am going to lead you all to the fucking cliff because you've been begging for it. Tristan, nobody in that room asked for this. Oh, come on! That is fucking bullshit. Okay? Everybody watching is culpable, you all post, and you tweet and you share. Everybody jumps for the chance to be both judge and jury. But in that system, Sheriff, you've have created a job opening. An executioner. You created me. So... Do you feel that you have made your point? Is that what you wanted? Yeah, sure, yeah. Great job, Sheriff. You've worked it all out. If there is no hard feelings I'd love to invite you up to my new cabin in Broken Bow. We can pack up with some cold ones, shoot the shit. Play some pool. I guess, all I needed today was to talk to some old fuck. Go figure, right? Tristan, I am asking you Please! Let those kids go. How can we get everyone out of that room safely including yourself? - It's not looking good. - Hey! Someone is letting the things out. I see what you did there, sheriff. My turn. - Right this way. - Mom. Connor. Thank God. Hey. Did you see Zoe Hull in there? Yeah, she got dirty blond hair, she's tall, skinny-- I know. She saved us. She was even outside at one point but she went back inside to help. Ma'am, just a few more questions for your son, if you wouldn't mind. Right this way. Anyway, I've got a number.... It's not fast, and it's not furious, none of that shit. Little closer to "Tortoise & The Hare". That's the reason I want the OG twist ending so... please, watch and see. It's like, it's not safe to shelter in place that shooters are going around to the different rooms. Rounding up the kids and bringing them to the cafeteria, and that's dangerous. But we gonna have to go. Everyone, we have to get up, and we've to get out of here. Anna. Kip? Okay, look, if nobody from my team is responding, is it safe to say that this might be our guardian angel? Will you please talk to me? No? Maybe like the rest of the world you're watching our show? I already asked nicely once. I'm here. Well, hello! You're a chick. What's your name, sweetheart? It's Zoe Hull. It's vaguely familiar. So, if you are talking to me from Anna's phone... She's dead. Huh? And Kip? Alive. Wishing he was dead. You've really made a mess of things, Zoe, you've really pissed in my corn flakes. Do you want more people to die? Is that why you did this? No. That's the last thing I want. All right, well. Here is what happens now. You're gonna drop whatever you're doing and you're gonna come to me. You're gonna beg for my forgiveness and that of my friend Chris, cause that was his little sister you just cut down. And to help motivate you, I'm gonna kill one person in this room every five minutes you don't show your face. Zoe, he'll kill you. And the timer starts now. Stop! Stop! I'm on my way. Okay? You can't just-- Get them out of here, and yourself too. Go! See, I don't make threats. Okay? I provide opportunities for growth. Move. Out of the way, out of the way, get back. Move. Move, out of the way, come on, let's go, let's go. Move it, move it, out of the way. Out of the way. Move. Come on. Let's go. Move it, move it. Let's go. Move. Move. Come on. Let's go. Move it. Move. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Move. Move. Please. Kill me. I shot Vicky Wolves when she was running away. She always used to smile at me. You have to pay for her murder. And all the others, believe it. What are you doing? Tik Tock, Zoe. I'm bad with numbers. But, has it been... two minutes or... four and a half? Okay. Right now. Right now, you are just a sad fat kid everyone in the world will hate, and when they look for a motive, they'll find out you were bullied. Someone will remember that day in the assembly and strangers will laugh at you all over again. Do you want that to be your legacy? Very good. Come on. Whoa. Whoa, whoa! - Where do you want us to stage? - Copy. They just landed. Right up here. I'll kill another I guess. Wait! Wait! Fuck. You? Green Jacket girl? When is the last time you took that damn thing off? Don't be shy, come in. Join us. You can kill me, just as easily, right here. I know. But, that would be terrible for rating. So, come in. I literally insist. Zoe, America. America, this is Zoe. Our guardian angel. Zoe. While you've been prancing around doing God knows what we've managed to make national television. Fuck, I mean I figure at the rate we are going we'll probably make international too. And for those playing the home game we've just unlocked the bonus round for 'Anything can happen.' What? Fame doesn't do it for you, Zoe? No. What does? People. Myself included, not dying. And what does it for you? Being definitive. And creating the ultimate version of something. I don't even have to be the first, I just have to be the best. You killed my sister? She was trying to kill me. I mean none of this ever had to happen-- None of this ever had to happen. God damn! Stand still, you bastards. Zoe, did somebody tip you off as to what we had planned? - No. - So, it was just a... right time, right place kind of situation? Something like that. She has to die, not just in... I will tell you when it's the right time, Chris. Chris, I will tell you - when it is the right time. - For Anna! Okay? He's obviously and understandably upset about his... sister. I don't know who the hell are you. It's over. Kiper. You didn't have the stomach for it after all. Drop the guns. - I'm not kidding. - If we don't, Kip, you are gonna have to do a lot more killing. Do you wanna do more killing, Kip? Are you prepared to do that? Put it down. You put it down, asshole! Fuck you! Hey! Come on! Come on, Lewis! Keep going, keep going. I'll bring 'em back. No. Go kill them and bring back the fucking phone. Come on. Lewis, Come on. Keep going. Keep going. Everybody stay the fuck down! This is not over. Run. Lewis, run. Shit, shit. Come on. Leave me. Leave you? What kind of this is that? Come on! You're okay? You were hit? Hence the "leave me" idea. Yeah. How bad is it? Well, according to you nothing matters if it happens at high school. Okay, okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. You got this. You're okay. You're okay. No, no, no! No, no, no! I don't want them to see us. Okay? I don't want them to see us. - It's cold in here. - No! No. You're not allowed to do that. Okay? Right here. Shit. Shit! Okay. Let me see. I need to tell you something. No, not now. Okay? Just... - tell me at prom. - Yeah. You are not the only good thing in my life. Oh, you are the best thing. Yeah, that's... so great. And I feel the same way. But I really do need to tell you something. I think the vans are rigged to explode. - They are in the cafeteria? - Yeah. Shit! - No, you stay. - I can't. This part I remember perfectly. You and me. We're stuck in a loop. You know, it's not always you. But every time I'm in this room I kill something. Shit. Killing my sister was new. How'd you break that pattern, huh? It was the symbols, wasn't it? Yeah. Almost got them in the right order. Been collecting 'em longer than you. So... fuck you, if you think you're gonna get out before me! No. Wait, wait! It was the symbols. That, it's hard to change the pattern. Oh yeah? I can show you the way out. That's exactly what they told me you'd say. There. Tree line. Hands up. Hands up. Show us your hands. On the ground! On the ground! On the ground. On the ground. Chris. Report back, man. Chris. Come on, man. Answer me. Fight! Chris, man, answer me. What do you think? Worth a thousand words? Fuck. Now, you're the one not talking? What's wrong, Tristan? I thought we've built up a nice support. Am I not being polite enough? With no response, can I assume you are watching my stream? You have no fucking idea who you're dealing with. You know, you're right. You actually are starting to slip my mind. I mean... isn't it ironic? That after all your goddamn hard work people aren't gonna remember you? No? No. They are gonna remember me. - Get up. On your feet. - Please. Please. Move! Get up on your feet! Everybody else stay the fuck down. Noses to the ground. If you look at me I will fucking kill you. Take this and move. Go. Go! Go! I was praying that it was you. I thought I told you to get outside. I will now. This is the last group from the roofs. - Are you coming with us this time? - I'll be right there. I'll be right there. All right. Come on. Let's go. All right. Just like your mama taught you. It really does not have to be difficult. Keep moving. Keep walking. All right? Do not turn around. Fuck. Okay. Get out! Now! Okay? He's gone. Go! Jesus Christ! Jesus. There is a bomb in there! Go! Go! Please! Come on! Good! Good! Keep going! Over here. Help me! Good. Faster! Move, move. Good, good. Keep going. Keep going. Go. Go. Shit. All right. Let's go. Let's go! Move. Go. Go. All right. Let's go! Let's move it! Oh my God. Stop! Stop! On your knees. Put your hands high. Get 'em up. Above your head. Bravo team. We're on the first floor. Suspect is neutralized. Hey, fall through, fall through. Let me know when you got a clear. Hey, I said on the fucking ground! Get on the fucking ground! Come on. Oh, that's gratitude for you? Don't they know who you are? You look beautiful. I know. It feels good. Thank you. I have to go now. I love you. Goodbye. You freed up in your hands so I could shake one. SWAT guys had no idea who you were so... I'm sorry about that. You know, lot of folks have a lot of questions for you. But we can talk about that later. That was a hell of a thing you did in there. Really. - All we are very proud of you, Zoe. - And Tristan? Dead. Burned to a crisp. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Well... almost anyone. Standby one. Can I ask you to do something for me? Name it. You were right. I was at war. Thank Christ for that. Mom would know just what to say right now, wouldn't she? Yes, she would. I guess that's why I still talk to her sometimes. Really? Yeah. It's creepy. Yeah. Thanks for saving my life. Honey... we are even. You gave mine a purpose eighteen years ago. Hey! Is he gonna be okay? Yeah, should be. We need to take a look at that leg. Oh, I'll be right over. Hey man, in a moment. What did they do with your rifle? Nothing yet. Last I saw it there was some little yellow evidence markers around it. It should be right where I left it. Oh. I didn't expect to deal with this scenario. But there is unfinished business to tend to. You see, it's tempting to let nature run its course. The lungs will fill with blood. And the animal will die naturally. But with that process comes extreme pain. And it just isn't right to let it suffer.
