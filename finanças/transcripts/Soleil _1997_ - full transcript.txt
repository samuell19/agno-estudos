It's in the suburbs of Paris. - You miss him? - Yes— What about you, do you miss your father? - No, you know I don't have a father. - Me too, it's as if I'd never had one since he's been gone. Yes, but you know where he is and you know he'll come back. Do you believe he thinks of us sometimes? The horse bath's tomorrow. - Come on, I've got some money. I'll buy you an ice cream at Barreri. Two pistachio! Who's paying? - It's on me. Thanks. - Thanks, my boy. Hello Madame Lévy. - Hello M Vincent. Where are you going? - To see if there's any work at Le Petit Duc. With Aunty Jeannette.

Mr. Vincent spoke to the principal. My father is a veteran. I have the right. All right, I'll have the fabrics delivered to your doorstep. But be careful, Madame Lévy, on time and neat work. - Oh yes, yes. Thank you very much Mr Layani. Thanks a lot. God bless you Madame Elkoubi. Run ahead, call him. Meyer we saw you! Mum found a job! She wants to talk to you. Good morning Madame Lévy. - Good morning. - Oh you came back, did you? - Well yes, you can see I came back. You kiss me too much. Leave me alone. I'll cook sardine fritters for you. Mounette, break an egg and put some flour on a flat plate. - Ok. - The big plate, hurry up. And me? - You set the table. - Don't slam the door! Grandma, come on! - I'm coming. Wait for me. Don't eat it all. But Mum, people aren't going to order you shirts any more. You don't know how to do them. - I do know how to do them. Simone Hachuche wanted 7cm collar points. But now you see, I'm doing them shorter. I'm doing normal collar points. All right, but you're not doing them very well. Yes I am, Aunty Jeannette cuts them. I just have to machine stitch. It's not complicated. You ask too many questions. - I just want to know. - Come here, give me a kiss me, come on. Here. - I want to look at you again. - So look at me. - When I'm rich, I'll take you to a restaurant. And when I grow up I'm going to France. Mum? We'll go to France one day? - Yes, yes. Do your homework. - The human body is complicated. - Yes. It's complicated. - One day I'll be a great surgeon. - Yes, son. - The greatest surgeon in France. - Yes. - They'll call me Professor Meyer Lévy. You'll see. - Yes. - Can I listen to the news? - Yes, Professor. - Have you sold the sideboard? - Yes. So you'll give me my pocket money tomorrow? - Yes. - Can I work while watching you? - Not tonight. - But I want to! - You should sleep. - No. - Tomorrow. - You always say tomorrow. - It's true that I always say tomorrow. - I know why. - So let's not talk about it. Where are we going? - To Guyotville. - What's on the luggage rack? - None of your business! - Is it black market? - Of course it's black market. How else do you think you get to eat? But you always ask questions. I just deliver. That's it. - Was it Madame Schwartzkopf who lent you the bikes? - They're from the workshop, she's every right to. The fabric. Eugénie! The lamb legs. Are there 3 metres? I'll take one, it'll be lighter. Is that Louise Bompard? - Yeah, it's Louise Bompard. We've come to see Madame Schwartzkopf. It's beautiful! Please sit down. - This is for Madame Schwartzkopf. Hello! Hello children, hello! You're well? Everything fine with you? Roseline, Roseline! Come on, eat up, eat up. Go on! Come on, eat! Have some more! Go on, more! You must be hungry. Pierrot, tell your mother I'll see her in the morning. - Yes Madame. - He's so handsome, isn't he? - Bye Madame. - Goodbye Pierrot. Goodbye my children. Are you sure the butcher only gave you one leg of lamb? - Yes Madame. Come on. Put the bikes back in the workshop. - Can I keep one to ride around a while? - No, they're not ours. - Fuck! It's always for others, never for us. You're not going to shove your communism down my throat, are you? - Of course! I'm a communist. And I'll be a communist all my life. The Young Communists are the only ones who care about us! Who's us? - The Jews! And what are you going to do with the lamb? - Guess— - Dinner's ready!! Mmmm, Madame Schwartzkopf's good lamb. - She's coming to see you tomorrow. She wants to talk to you about me. - I'm sure she wants to give you her daughter's hand. - Well, he's the right age, nearly 17. I'm sure she wants you to get engaged to the cripple. - She's not a cripple! - Yes she is, she's lame. She's bow-legged. I'm surprised she can walk. - Meyer, that's enough! There's more to life than beauty. - What about me? You're not asking what I think? - I'm sure you'll refuse. - You're pissing me off! - What's up, Pierrot? - All this engagement, engagement— Madame Schwartzkopf wants to ask you to keep some fabrics and carpets for her. Because of Financial Control, she hides some with all her employees. And when the Americans land, she'll pick them up. I know everything. There's an Italy-Germany Armistice Commission at the Hotel Aletti, so she's scared. Jews have to help each other. - Of course we have to help each other. Poor and rich, rich and poor. - And you, the communist, did you know the Americans were going to land? - Of course I knew that. Better than you. Mum! Mum! Madame Schwartzkopf is here. - I'm coming! Take the back stairs. - Good morning children, good morning! - Pierrot, it's Madame Schwartzkopf! - Where's my Pierrot? Ah here he is. Good morning Pierrot! - Morning. - Well? - Everything's prepared. - Ah, very good. Quick. Good morning, Madame Lévy. - Madame Schwartzkopf. - Are you well, Madame Lévy? - Yes yes. - Did Pierrot explain to you, Madame Lévy? - Yes. - Good. You won't regret it. Just leave it in the cupboard and forget about it. And as for Pierrot, don't worry about him, I'll take care of his future. - Are you going to increase his wages? - Of course, my dear girl. And that's for the little one. Look, Madame Elkoubi, it's not possible. Look at the sleeves, Madame Elkoubi. That's a regular 16-year-old's overcoat. Look at the sleeves of your sister's coat. They're 5 cm shorter. I can't do anything with these coats. And wait, that's not all, Madame Elkoubi. Look at the length. The regular— It's 1 metre 10. Your sister's are 1 metre. I can't sell them for 16-year-olds. What is she doing? Is she keeping the fabric? - My sister is not a thief. Don't get angry Madame Elkoubi. Don't get angry. You're going to be handsome as a prince, son. Put your arms in the sleeves. Mum, give me the pins, please. Thank you.. - What is Pierrot doing? - Deliveries. Late deliveries. He may have a fiancee. - A fiancee? Yes. The other day, when I was waiting for him outside the workshop, I saw him coming out with Louise Bompard. A French girl, Grandma. You don't know her. - I know her. She's beautiful. - One day I'm going to kiss her too. She's 24. - So what? If she wants. - Go and tell your sisters to turn off the light. They're going to tear their eyes out with their Ciné-Monde and Ciné-Miroir. French State, National Broadcasting. What are you doing with all this stuff? - So I can have a little upturned nose like Myrna Loy. - And Hedy Lamarr. - You too? I'm only trying. - And you're going to stay like that all night? - Yes. - I hope you're not planning to do this to Annie so she looks like Shirley Temple. - No, don't worry. Turn off the lights, girls, enough is enough! Have you read my report card? I'm on the Roll of Honour and I got the Excellence Award. - You need that if you want to become Professor Meyer Lévy. - I'm first in everything. French, Latin, Mathematics, History. - That's good, my boy. - I'm only second in Geography. I didn't want to brag. You're not going out? - It's Jeannot Vincenti. Isn't this Vincenti crazy to whistle the Internationale in the middle of the night? Meyer! Don't you think we have enough problems as it is? - I've got to go! - Don't slam the door! When the Americans land, Algeria will be free. - What does free mean? - Independent! - You're dreaming, Kader. - Fuck it, the cops! - Second, it's not a 'g'. You spell it with a 'c'. - Who cares! - Stop! You stop! Come here! - Let me go! - Stop twisting like that! - Let me go! - Get in! - Let me go! Bastard! Let me go! You have to wait until tomorrow morning. You'll be up in front of the commissioner. He'll be here at 9 am. - But—you're not going to keep my son here all night? - Don't come before 9. There's no point. - Come on. Take care, don't wake your sisters. I'm on the Roll of Honour and I got the Award for Excellence. I'm only second in Geography. I didn't want to brag Hey, Moktar! - Ah, Madame Lévy, good morning! - Good morning. Do you want to buy a dresser and a bed? - I don't need them at the moment. - Come upstairs, you'll see, they're not expensive. - I'll do it for you but I don't need them. - Come upstairs, you'll see. - Very well! - Very well— No, me first! - Calm down! - Go on! - Thanks. - Don't you have tableware and carpets? - Carpets are expensive! Well, it depends. Carpets are like women. When they're beautiful like you, they're expensive, yes. - Right, the bed first. - Yes, fine for the bed. But don't you have any material? And carpets, carpets? - I'm off, Mum, morning Moktar. - And the dresser? - Yes the dresser's fine. Fine for the dresser, but carpets? - Hold on. Wait there. Come here. - This is more like it. How much? - Five thousand. - Four. - Two? - Three! - All right, for you, 2800. Deal? Could you sell all the carpets? - Come back next week. Madame Lévy! - Yes. - Ahmed, get me young Meyer. So, we have a fearsome Marxist in the district? - He's a child. - I know but the words are still on the walls and there's nothing childish about them. Sit down. - He'll clean them off. Iif necessary, I'll do it myself. - That's a good start. I'm waiting, Ahmed! Get me young Meyer Lévy, he's in the block. Bring him here! If Meyer does a mea culpa, and agrees that he and his friends will erase the words, we'll forget the case. With the assurance that they won't do it again, of course. Here or anywhere else. Sit down Meyer. - No, I prefer to stand. And first of all, why are you talking to me like an Arab? - He talks to you like that because you're a child, Meyer. It's out of kindness. - Listen, Monsieur Lévy, are you well, Monsieur Lévy? - Yes. - Well then, Monsieur Lévy! Your mother and I have come to an agreement. You clean off Opening of the second front and we forget everything. You go home, we don't talk about it again. Believe me— Your mother has enough to worry about. This really isn't the time for me to send you to the juvenile judge. - All right, I agree. But I don't want to clean off Opening of the second front. I am a communist. - It's all right. - I'll do it, Commissioner, it's all the same. The important thing is that it disappears. - All right, but do it now. With the holidays approaching, I don't want the walls of Algiers turning into a Soviet propaganda outlet. You understand me? - I understand you, Commissioner. Thank you very much Commissioner. You're not going to do it again during the holidays? - No, I promised. - I found you a job for the holidays. - Good. - You'll earn some money. - I'll give it all to you. What job is it? - At Mr. Pulito's shoe polish factory. - Oh no! - Why not? - There's only girls. I don't want to work there! - Why does that bother you? They're workers, same as you. - I'm not a worker. - Well you're going to be a worker! And it's nothing, two months. Meyer, it's hard for me. Everything— Kids, work, the house, money. - Money— When do I start? - Tomorrow morning. - Can we go to the beach this afternoon? - Yes, I have everything ready. We're going to have some enjoyment before— - Before what? - Before the shoe polish. You go and have a swim too. Mum, Mum, your cousin Esther. - Hello Titine, may I sit down? Come on, come on girls. What a day! We enjoyed today. Mum? - Yes. - Can you buy me some fries? - Next time, Meyer. Why did you ask her? You knew she couldn't. - I didn't know! - You do know. You still want everything. You know, Mum— - Yes? - Earlier, about the fries, I was only asking. - I know. You didn't do it on purpose. It's not good! Meyer, give me the clothespins. I have to go to France. I'll be back in two weeks. - Why are you going? - I'm happy. With the sirocco, the laundry will dry faster. You need your father. Yes, you do. I can't take care of you alone. - Are you going to bring him back with you? - Yes. - No! - Meyer, your dad loves you. You, especially— - I don't care! When do you leave? - Noon tomorrow. I'm going on the boat, I have my ticket. - You're coming back? - Yes. - You will come back? - Look at me. I swear. Bye Mum. See you soon! Where's the big dumpling got to? - Don't talk about your sister like that! - Maybe she's my sister but she's still fat, sorry. - Get a move on, shithead! Fuck me! That coat! - Shut up! Come on, I'm coming with you. - Why are you going this way? - I'll explain later! Shit! Hurry up! - Come on, quick! - Why the big detour? - I'll explain at recess. Are you leaving? - Yes. - Will you come back? - Yes. Hey you, where are you off to? - Let me go! Where did you get this coat? - Let me go! - Show me! Please! - I don't care about your coat! That explains the ten centimetres! Has she gone? - Yes. She'll be back. - It's impossible! It's not true! Where are you going, Meyer? Come back, Meyer, come back! She's gone to find your father! Your father! Mum! I'm tired of doing thirty-six servings! Either you eat together, or you manage on your own. If it's going to be like that, I'm leaving! - Where are you going? - Shopping. But you haven't done your homework? - I'll do it later. - I know for a fact, he's off to the Casbah. Don't worry, I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm shopping. You'll end up a dealer! - Better than being a courier. Here, Meyer. You'll be a good dealer, Meyer. - Thank you Mr. Esposito. Meyer, promise me your first time will be with me. Yes Paula. MARSEILLES FAMILY BOARDING-HOUSE THE AZOULAY SISTERS Titine! - Gaëtan, the suitcases! - Titine! - Gaëtan, the suitcases! Oh my dear, you're still so beautiful. Tomorrow we're going to Cassis, to the beach. I know a man who does this sometimes. He's a lifeguard, he's nice. His name is Tonin San Marco. I hope he's not busy. If he's available, I'll take care of everything with him. Money, the departure, everything. You'll have nothing to worry about. Thank you Souka, I'll never forget it. - Have a cake. Made with margarine but still very good. I make them myself, Titine. - Thank you, Honorine. Cheers. To Joseph. Come on, it's free. We're going to Montchanin. We'll make a few changes and arrive at night. Oh! Wait! Let me help you. Are you all right? How old are you? - I'm 25. - I'm 52. I could be your mother. Montchanin, this is Montchanin, Two minutes stop. You have to understand him, he takes risks. And his process is secure: He delivers his produce across the Line. It's his routine. It's there, 140. Mr. Joseph Leroy Postmaster Is that you? - Yes, it's me. - Come in, come in! You didn't make too much noise in the stairs? - No, I was careful. - Oh, I'm so happy. - Me too. Are you thirsty? - No, let me. I know where everything is. I'll do it. Want some lemonade? - It's made with saccharine. - Same as in Algiers. Sit beside me. You have to come back home, Joseph. - No. - The children need you. - I can't manage all alone. - I can work here. I can send you half my wages. Over there, I won't be able to work. You understand? Here, I have my false papers. There, I won't be able to work. Everyone knows me. Can you imagine me telling them— My name is—Joseph Leroy? Can you imagine me in the street? The children would run after me shouting Leroy the Jew! - But you don't have to call yourself Leroy there. You don't need to work at the post office. You can find other small jobs. All Jews work in Algeria. - Not in the administration. You know very well it's prohibited by Vichy law. You were fired, you know how it is. You know all that. - How long will it last? - Not long, I know that. - Know it? Or believe it? - I believe it. How long do you think you'll be protected here? Pierre Laval is the mayor of Aubervilliers. He's a veteran like me. He's the one who decides. He's the one who gave me my false papers. I said thank you. - You're the communist and you're thanking Pierre Laval? - I'm the communist and I have 5 children. What time did you plan to leave? - 6 am. - Don't change anything. - What about you? - Where's your rendezvous? - The Pantin metro station. - You'll be leaving in 20 minutes. I brought you your stuff. Some cans. It's easier over there. Tomorrow, we all get to fuck! - What are you talking about? Are you mad? - No, no I'm telling you. Tomorrow, we're all going to fuck. Lulu Vosgien organised it. - Are you going too? - Yes, of course! - But you're eleven and a half. You can't. - Lulu Vosgien told me I can. - Tell him I'm coming too. Who's going to be there? - Everyone's going. - The whole district? - No, there'll be seven of us. Kader, Charlot Nadal, Jeannot Vincenti, Bébert Fitussi, and the three of us with Lulu Vosgien. - Bébert Fitussi? Are you are crazy? He's nine and a half years old! - Lulu Vosgien told me he can. Where are you going? - To pick up Pierrot at work. - Wait, I'm coming with you. - No, no, no. Pierrot! Pierrot! Come here! Tell her I'd like to kiss her on the mouth. - Ask her yourself. - But she won't, I'm too young. - So what do you want me to tell her? You're crazy! - Figure it out! Don't watch. - Hurry up, I don't want anyone to see us. - Down a bit. What's up with you? Meyer! - Meyer! Meyer. Coming! This won't work. We'll never be accepted with him, he's too young. - We just have to say he's a dwarf. - That's it, just say I'm a dwarf. Wait for me, I'll put on some longs and be right back. Wait for me! Meyer! Where you are going? - We're going swimming. - Wait for me, I'm coming with you. - No, no, no! Kader, you block the front door then meet us at Rue du Lézard. Next! Do you think he'll manage? - Yeah, that's his girlfriend. You two go first. I'll take the last turn, yeah? - Fine. But if you want, you can drop out and come back next time. - All right, all right! I agree. I'll come back next time. - Fine. You can still drop out if you want. - Fine. Hot, hot! Donuts, donuts! Do you think this is love? - Yes! - How could you know? You didn't even come in, you chickened out! - I just know! I even know things I can't talk about. - Come on, talk. - Yes, go on Dédé. Go on Dédé, talk! - Want me to talk? Well, let me tell you something not many people know. Women— They bleed every month. - Are you crazy? You're off your head! Do really women bleed every month? - Yes. All women? - Yes, all women. - But why? They bleed for no reason, just like that? - That I don't know. It seems to be natural. - It's not true! Neither my mother nor my sisters bleed! - All of them! Your mother and sisters too! - Liar! Bitch! I'm going to kill you! Tell me that's wrong, motherfucker! Bastard! - Stop! You trying to kill him? - Let me go! - You can kill me. I told you the truth! I believe that's true. Maybe I'm wrong. That's it, you're wrong! Shut your mouth, you brat! Meyer, Dédé! I'm going to kill you! I'll slaughter you! He doesn't know what he's talking about! He was wrong. - I'll massacre you! - I'll strangle him! I have to strangle him! - Jeannette, it's your son! - Mum! Mum! - Bunch of thugs, go home! Bunch of bastards! Oh Dédé— - Mum, they hit me. - Your turn, Marceau! I'm the only one who loves you. - Focus on the game! I'm the only one who loves you. You came back. All of you will have to work. You'll no longer be able to act like other children. Well. That's all— - I want to work too. - Yeah that's now, but inside a week you'll be whining. Mum, Mum, I don't want any more, Mum. - Oh stop it, Pierrot! He's young. - Besides, I've already found a job at Munoz Fisheries. You shouldn't come and see me at work, I'm going to change my name. - Why, son? Why do you want to change your name? - They don't hire Jews. My name will be Dumontier. - Dumontier? - Yeah, it's more French. They don't ask for ID, they just hire the best students for desk jobs. Mr. Vincent recommended me. - I'll have to thank your teacher. - It's normal, he says I'm a brilliant student. Did you tell him you're a communist? - He knows. He doesn't care. MUNOZ Fisheries Well, Dumontier, everything all right? Do you have any problems? - No, no, Madame, it's not difficult. - Very well. - I'm Jean-Claude Salvant, I'm in 8th grade at Lycée Delacroix. You? I'm 8th grade too but at Lycée Bugeaud. My name's Christian Dumontier. - Oh Lévy! Meyer, it's me! - Shhh! Come here! Come here! Sit down. Manu, I beg you, don't call me Lévy any more. I registered under the name of Dumontier. So you call me Dumontier, that's all. You got it? Dumontier. - Sure. M Dumontier is wanted in the director's office. M Dumontier. Well. Is your name Lévy? - Yes Monsieur. - You lied? - Yes Monsieur. - Are you Jewish? - Yes Monsieur. - Your weekly wages. After all, you people like money, don't you. - Thank you Monsieur. - Why did you lie? - I don't know Monsieur. - Are you ashamed of your name? - Yes Monsieur. - You're quite right. Meyer! What's wrong? You've been crying? - I've been fired from Munoz fisheries. - Forget it, they're a bunch of pricks. Come on, let's go for an anisette at Tantonville. - No, I have to give my money to my mother. - Just take a few coins from your wages, she won't notice. - But they're not going to serve us on the terrace, we're too young. - Yes they will! I know the waiter, he's Charlot Nadal's cousin. Go away, Bébert, you're too young. Here! Babilas, two Phoenixes! - That works! Is it alcohol? - Yeah, it's very good. Drink it all down, it'll do you good. Babilas, two Phoenixes! Babilas, two more Phoenixes! Oh, the little cat— Babilas, I'm waiting! Jeannot. I would like to sing. - Go ahead, sing. ♪ This is the final struggle ♪ ♪ Let us gather together, and tomorrow ♪ ♪ The Internationale ♪ ♪ Will be the human race. ♪ ♪ This is the final struggle ♪ I want to go home. Meyer, what's going on with you? Mum, come quick! - They fired me. - But what's wrong with you? What's wrong? - They fired me from Munoz Fisheries. You've been drinking? - Three anisettes. - But that's alcohol. - I didn't realize. - Sarah, go and make some black coffee. - Apart from that, here's my my wages. I give you everything. They fired me. - You poor thing, sit down. - What did I tell you? - I don't want to work any more. The communist doesn't want to work any more? - He's not well, what's wrong with him? - I won't work any more. - You don't want to work any more, communist? - Oh shut up, Pierrot! Can't you see your brother is sick? - Sick? He's drunk, yeah! - Drink this, darling. - Mum, Mum. - Yes? - Look, Esther's coming. - I have no more to give her. I have no more to give her. Listen to me. She lives better than us. Don't worry. Everyone gives to her. Don't move. She mustn't think we're here. Breathe slowly. She mustn't hear us. - Titine, open the door! I know you're here! Open the door! Open the door! Titine! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Come on! Titine, open the door! - Louder! Louder! Come on, louder! - Aunty, open the door! Aunty, open the door! - God will punish you. You and your children. Trash! Whore! Come on, let's go. I have nothing left, Jeannette. Nothing. - Here, take this. Take it, it's fresh. Wait, I'll join you. Mum, it's Monday, can I have my pocket money? - Tomorrow. I don't want to give you it today. - You always say tomorrow! - It's true, I always say tomorrow. - And why do you always say that? Because I always hope tomorrow will be better. - So tomorrow I'll get my 2 francs, yes? - Meyer— I can't give you your 2 francs tomorrow. I can't give you anything more. You have to do the same as your brothers and sisters. They no longer get pocket money. None of them. - But why? - I can't do it any more. - Well at least give me one franc today and another one tomorrow. - I'm sick of this! I need it! - No. - But why? - That's enough! That's it! I've had enough! You're selfish. You only think of yourself. What about me? Me? Do you think even a little about me? Do you? I have nothing. There's nothing left. Nothing! Nothing! - I don't believe you. I'm sure you're lying. - I'm sure you have some money. How are we going to eat tomorrow? I'm sure you have money to buy food. Let me go! Meyer— Here. Here. You're my son. Take this 5-franc coin. But there's one condition. Spend it all. Spend it all. - No. Technique , kids! Technique! It's sloppy! It's over, Mum. It's finished. - Oh God. Make it be true. Make it be true. On November 8, 1942, American troops landed in Morocco and invaded Algeria. Prelude to the Liberation of France. The Americans entered our city, then our district, and even our alleys. Shit, it's Louise Bompard. Madame Lévy! Madame Lévy, come down! The Americans are here! The Americans are here now! We're free! The war is over! Hitler is over! Oh Madame Lévy! We're saved! We're saved! We're saved! Long live the Americans! Pierrot? Where is my Pierrot? Oh, Madame Lévy! The carpets and the fabrics, did you leave them in the same place? - What fabrics? What carpets? - What carpets? What fabrics? Seriously, Madame Lévy? Did I not give you carpets and rolls of material? - No. - I'm not crazy. You put them in the hall cupboard there! Annie was there. You sold them, didn't you? You sold them to feed your children, didn't you? At least tell me the truth! You're a thief, a liar! - I don't understand what you're talking about, Madame Schwartzkopf. You gave me nothing. - We put them in the cupboard together! Here! - What did we put there? I don't understand. - The fabrics! The carpets! - Very well, if you say we put them in the cupboard, let's have a look. - Come on, Annie, tell the truth. You were there. - No. You are a liar and a thief too! just like your mother! - Don't cry. - We put them there, in the cupboard! There! - Let's see if there's anything in the cupboard— You see Madame Schwartzkopf? There's nothing. You must have been mistaken. Perhaps you left them for safe-keeping somewhere else?. - And you, Meyer? You didn't see anything either? - I wasn't there. Mohamed! Come with me, come on. Good evening. May I? - Yes. - And one for me too? - Of course. - Can I have some more? - Yes, go ahead, tout. - Everything? - Yes, tout! This too? - Yes, tout! And that? - Yes, tout. Go ahead. - Okay. - Three? Go ahead, one more. - Thank you. And that? - Go right ahead. - Two? - Yes, another one for the little girl. - Come on, help Mum. Goodbye, thank you. - I'm fed up. It's half past eleven. I'm going to bed. Coming? - No, I'll wait for them. - Are you waiting for them or for the Amercans' cookies? - I'm not going to answer that. - I haven't told anyone else this. Tomorrow, I'm meeting Gilbert Baranès and Christian Ruby at Place El Djezair. We're joining up with de Gaulle. We go through Kairouan then join the 1st DFL I'd be ashamed to stay here while others fight for us. - You're right. - I'm leaving tomorrow. ♪ I will wait ♪ ♪ Night and day, ♪ Whatever you do, don't wake them up. ♪ I will wait forever ♪ ♪ For you to come back ♪ - Oh, he's sleeping, poor boy. We're not waking him up to give him cookies? - Oh no! - We'll wait until tomorrow morning. - Oh yes. - You woke me up. - Oh sorry— - How was it? - Very good, very good. - All right, we're going to bed. Are you coming, Annie? - Yes. Good night. - Good night. See you tomorrow. - We brought you sandwiches and cookies. You want some? - Yes. - He said yes. - Go and see if Pierrot is asleep. Eat up, go on. He's asleep. I didn't want to wake him. We'll save his share for morning to go with his café au lait. - Mum? - Yes? - Pierrot is going to enlist in the army. In the Free French Forces. He leaves tomorrow. Don't try to stop him. M Murator? - Yes? - My name is Lévy and I'm not ashamed of my name. Is this Annie? - Yes, it's Annie. - She's changed. - She's five years older. - You don't recognize me? - Don't be afraid. - Give your father a kiss. - It's all right. - Go on, kiss him. Grandma! Meyer, Meyer! You've grown. I would never have recognized you. - He's 5 years older too. Meyer, kiss your father. I put all your sweaters in the case. It's cold in France. Especially in the summer. God bless you. No. Check it when you're on the boat. Well, I'm done. Goodbye. Go and kiss your father. Don't forget— I told all my colleagues at the Post Office that you were going to become the greatest surgeon in France. - I won't forget. Meyer. Let me give you my cap. - Thank you Dad. ♪ I will wait night and day, ♪ ♪ I will wait forever for you to come back ♪ ♪ I will wait for the bird flying away ... ♪ My city was fading away. My life was fading with it. To all the children lucky enough to be loved and to all those who have not had that joy. English subtitles by jeremys and Marseille TNT 2022
