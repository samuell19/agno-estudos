Debar for 100 years? Mahi! Are you still sleeping? Whoa! You have already taken a shower. Hmm. Very good. Study for some time. I... Hate Maths! I had a dream last night. I flunked my exams and repeated 10th grade all over again. All the students were mocking me. Stop laughing... You were right beside me in my dream. I also had a dream last night. Teacher caught me cheating on my Math exam. And I was debarred for 100 years. Oh my god! - I wasn’t in the dream with you, was I? - I’m not sure. I won’t be there… I’m not as dumb as you when it comes to Math. Correct. You’ll clear the exams anyway. I just hope I pass the supplementary. I’ll not take up Math ever again. I’ll pursue Bi.P.C in Intermediate. You don’t have to write the supplementary. I have an idea for you. What’s that? Let’s do combined studies. What do you say? Hello? I should get Varna a return gift. Have you got any ideas for me? Our Pre-Final exams are in 2 days... And you’re thinking about the return gift. Yes! Give me an idea, buddy. I don’t have any ideas. Bye! Oh no! Oh God! Hello. Yeah, he’s studying. Mahi! You have a call from Vayunandan. What is it? Tell me.. I have an idea for the return gift. It’s too late, I got my own idea. Oh, really? Care to tell me? I’ll tell you in the evening. In case my mom calls, tell her I’m at your place. We are doing combined studies. Okay? Where are you going, man? Bro, there’s a micro artist in the area that carves names on rice grains. Where is he? Tell me your name. - Vani And the kid’s name? Harish. Rafi... Boss? You can collect it in 30 minutes. What’s your name? What got you thinking? Tell me your name. Actually, I’m not here to get my name carved. If you are here to gift micro art to your girlfriend... Get out of here immediately. I’m saying this as the father to a teenage girl... I don’t encourage teenage crushes. He’s still a kid. And he has a girlfriend already. What are you looking at? Mind your own business. I’m going home... Don’t leave unless you dispatch all the orders... - Okay? - Hmm. Okay, boss. I must thank you, bro. I opened the store on time because you made me hurry. Saved me from his sermon. I’ll be going to college in 2 months. Do I still look like a kid to him? That’s how he is, bro. He’s too orthodox. Don't feel bad. You must’ve been hurt that he yelled at you. But I was really scared. Why is that? He said he feels responsible as a teenage girl’s father... His teenage daughter and I are in love. He was too furious at you. Wonder what he will do if he finds out about us. He possibly can’t scare you, bro. He might be elder to you. But he’s got no talent. He notes customer names and hands it to you. You are the real deal. You can get it done if you want to. Will you please do it for me? No way! My boss will find out. I’ll not tell him... You won’t either. There’s no way he’ll know. - Where are you from? - Secunderabad. You cycled this far from Secunderabad? Hmm. I like your sincerity. I’ll do it for you. But I should get to know you first... Will you tell me your story? Okay. People born in the star ‘Revathi’ don’t have family support... I’m a living example... My family is not supportive to me... Dad is on my side but he’s always camping for work. Me, my favorite hero Mahesh Babu, mom and grandma live together. Chinna! Hey, Chinna! Where are you? I’m almost done with this book. Get me a new book from the temple. Give me hundred bucks. I just put it in the donation box. So what? Take it out for me. How can I do that? Give me the money. I’ll show you how to do it. Uh-huh. Hey, Mahi! My mom is calling... I’ll be right back. Will you wait tell then? Or will you go to your husband? What do you need? I need you to go to the shop. Did you keep me in home for the chores? Why don’t you send me to boarding school along with sister? Why are you hasty? Finish your tenth grade... You’ll be sent to boarding school of course. Mummy! Grandma wants a new book. Give me dad’s bike keys. What do you mean? You want to ride the bullet now? Why can’t I do it? I don’t know if you noticed... But you’re not old enough yet. Now go! When I look back at my teenage in a few years... Grocery shop and the temple is all I have to remember. Damn it! Bad mommy. Hi, sister... Are you studying well? Yeah... So-so... Why do you keep arguing with your family? There are so many reasons. First of all... They make me do all the chores. Second of all... They still treat me like a kid. I have to bring milk everyday... They make tea for themselves. And milk is all I get. Am I still looking like a milkboy? I guess this smile made him fall for you. Who? A guy in this colony is a big fan of your smile. Really? Who is it? Do I still look like a milkboy? No. No. Not at all. Now you're a grown up boy. His name is Srikanth. He moved to D block 6 months back. He wants me to give you his love letters. Why didn’t you help him? First reason. I don’t like people who ask me favors. Second reason... I’m not a kid to pass love letters. Please, please... For once... Put aside your reasons and take the letters next time. Let’s see what he wrote. No! No! Never! I will not doing that. Bye! Come on! Give me the money! Give me the money. We’re the recent victims to this monster from the other colony... He grabs our underwear and steals our pocket money. Bad luck! My friend Vayunandan is his prey for today. Move! Move! Keep going. You can’t escape from me. - Come on! Pedal faster. - He’s coming. Keep going. Go fast, bro! Go! Go! He’s coming. He’s so close. Go fast! Keep going, bro. He’s going to get us. Keep going. Keep going. Leave me. You think you’re a hero, huh? Give me all you’ve got. No. Stop. Hey! No! Pay up! No, that’s my money! See... I lost the 100 bucks mom gave me. Hello! I’ll give you this. Give his money back. Alright. Take it. Hey! What do we do now? Mom will kill me if I go home without the sugar. You go to that shop everyday. Ask him for credit. He might give the sugar on credit... But he’ll not give the change for 100 bucks. Money is more important to mom than sugar. Hey, dude! I got the money. Yes! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Don’t cry. I’ll buy you a new one. We’ll only buy it. Just give us the money. You just want the money? Hey! Hey! Stop. Alright. How much? - 100 rupees. - Hey! It’s for 150 bucks, bro. Yeah, right. 150 bucks. 150 bucks. - 150? - Yeah, 150. Okay. I’ll give you the money. Not just 150. I’ll give you 200 bucks. Please don’t cry, okay? I only have 50 bucks right now. Take it. My store is close by. Take the remaining amount over there. Okay? Shit! I’ve got no cash here. What the hell! No one’s coming. Do you have customers around this time? Yeah. Wait. Hey, boy. Move. Hey, sweetie. Give me money. Those kids are waiting for the money... Go away. He doesn't even have 10 rupees with him. Boy, give me some money. They’re kids. They won’t have cash on them. - Let’s go. - Huh? We’re kids?! Hey! No! No! Come on, give it. Here you go. - See that? - Wow! God bless you. God bless you. Why are you so angry, bro? I don’t know where his money is coming from. But he buys a new shirt everyday. At first, I was happy to get a good customer. But I found out he dresses up everyday... Only to impress the girl I like, Shalini. - Oh. - Here’s 150 bucks. He bought shirts in this model, right? Yeah, right. Give me these 3 shirts. I’ll try to drive him out of the colony. I'll give you my store if you can do that. What’s the plan? Bananas! Bananas! Bananas! What? That’s a two-sided shirt?! Hey... You keep watching... - I’ll be right back, okay? - Okay. Grandpa... Grandpa... Take it. Look ahead. Mind your own business. Pramila, here I am. Hi! All other schools declared holidays already. Is your school still working? No holidays for 10th graders in our school. Show me your hand. What is this? Today, I put a waste paper in my school corridor in the dustbin. That was it. My class teacher noticed... She informed the Head Mistress... She called me on stage and said ‘You are caught while doing something good’. She had the students applaud me and tie this band. Now you were caught while doing something good... So you deserve it. I think mom is home. I should get ready for tuition. Bu-bye. Hey, girl. Care to offer us some? Go ask them. Hey, sweetie! Sweetie! Sweetie, give us some. That girl sent us to you. She said you have the holy offering. Come on, give it. Wow! Same pinch! Pinch me. Huh? Pinch you?! Don’t you know what pinching means? Come on, sweetie. Pinch me. Pinch me, sweetie. Go away. Go away. Yay!!! Sweetie, stop. Hey, boy. How long to fix the puncture? About 10 minutes. Hey... Give me that. Get the bike fixed... I’ll go return these to Karthik bro. Ball, please. Ball. Ball. Ball. Hey, stop! What are you looking at? Hey! A girl passed by, staring at you. This is not the first time. When you went to return Karthik bro’s shirts... Yes... She was staring at you back then too. Hey! There she is. Pedal faster. Go! National College. She’s a college student?! Are you okay with that? What’s happening in your college, bro? Who are all those people? They are the future college students... Pre admissions are going on for 10th graders. Admissions so early? We aren’t done with exams yet. Seats will be occupied if you wait till then. You have to reserve in advance. Hey! Hey! Damn! Hey... What is it? Come here. Who are you guys? Bro, we are tenth grade students... We’re here for the pre admissions. Yes. Go to my room 104 and clean up. Also leave the key in the window. Okay? Yeah, sure. Go. Hey... Don’t touch any of my stuff in the room. Okay, bro. Don’t touch any of my stuff in the room. Yuck! Yuck! This is not a soft drink. Hey, Mahi... That girl is over here. Look. Hey! Hey! She’s leaving... I’m following her. You come home somehow. Bye. - Hello, ma’am. - Hello. - Did you get the admission? - Yeah, we did. Thank you, ma’am. Hey! Who are you? Baby, hold this. Come on. Srikanth bro! This is my first ever love letter. I’m writing the words I can’t express. Song from the film ‘ Swapna’, sung by SP Bala Subrahmanyam. Requested from Bellampalli by... Yesudas Goud, Srinivas Goud,Yadagiri Goud, Mallesh Goud and Prakash Goud. "I feel youthful all of a sudden" "I run to you with excitement" "I can't take my eyes off you" "My heart is jumping out of joy" "Shall I welcome your glances striking at me?" "Shall I thank your heart for choosing me?" "Your tempting beauty..." "I see it all around me" "Your amusing thoughts..." "I feel them take over me" "The day I don't get to see you" "My life feels withered" "The second I don't get to think of you" "I feel a void in me" "I feel youthful all of a sudden" Sister... What? You asked for it, right? Here you go. I got you his love letter. Oh, thank you. Can I give a small piece of advice? What? Don’t love him. His love is not original. Hi! Mahi Teja? I know your name. Do you know mine? That day at the market... You left without writing your name on the board. Varna. Oh. Varna. Deepika. Hi. - Hi. - I’m Deepika. Mahi Teja. Which grade are you in? 10th grade. Wow! We’re also in the 10th grade. Which school? Vivekananda High School. Mm-hmm. We’re from Veda High School. Oh, okay. Varna told us a lot about you. About me? You gave a shirt to an old man on the street. Remember? Yeah. I’ve noticed a couple of times since then... I wanted to be friends with you. Hold this. Show me your hand. Why? Show me your hand! What is this? It’s a special band for ‘Caught while doing something great’. We visited Balaji temple recently. We came across a shop called ‘Eega Micro Arts’. We had this specially made for you. We had your name carved on a rice grain... And got a magnifying glass fixed around it. Do you like it? You had my name carved on a rice grain? That is why I asked your name at the market. I didn’t know a girl’s look have so much to say. Hey, Mahi! Hi! Okay then. Bye. Hmm. Bye. Okay. Bye. Buddy, introduce them to me. Varna... Come, let’s go. This is my friend. Hi. Vayu. Vayunandan. I’m Deepu. Deepika. Hey! Are you in love? Umm... Naughty boy! Come on. Come on. But it’s pointless... She thinks I’m just a friend. It’s really hard for me to just be friends with her. Hey, don’t worry. Girls say you’re just a friend at first... They will only propose later. What if she doesn't propose? We will do it. But this is not the time. High school girls are very dangerous. They share everything with their moms. But if we wait until college... Because they start feeling like adults... They don’t tell their moms... They will accept us easily. Mummy... Want me to help? Don’t assume I’m looking for a favour. I need to discuss something important in my life. Hmm. Tell me. Have you thought about my college admission? There’s a lot of time. Finish your exams first. If we wait till then... All the good college seats will be full. You’ll get me into some crappy college then. Hmm. Looks like you’ve already chosen a college. You are smart, mom. Which college is it? National College. Do they have hostel facility? Why Hostel? You wanted to be a hosteller in Intermediate, right? That college has a super cool hostel. Oh. So you have everything sorted. Hmm. Okay. I’ll talk to your dad tomorrow and let you know. Why wait, mom? Talk to him right now. He must be busy right now... He’ll get angry if we disturb him. Why are you in a hurry? I’ll talk to him. Okay? - You go. - Okay. Hey! You’re going to school. Not a movie show. Button up your shirt. Hey! Why don’t you listen to your mom? Button up completely. Also, close the gate on your way. Why don’t you do it? Here. Take it. Finish it before the assembly ends. I’m tired of eating cashew every day. Bring almonds from tomorrow. Why did you miss the prayer? Silence! Take the chewing gum. In our story, Patan was against King Ramaraju’s activities. He chewed hard on the bread to express disinterest. He spit it out to show disgust, rage, agony, anger, grudge and grief. Silence! Silence! And every time I saw him in the play again... I was ecstatic with joy like everyone else. Raghava’s performance was highly applauded by the spectators. K. Vayunandan... Come here. Write this sum on the board. What is the answer? Y is equal to 23 by 10. Why was the solution different in your book? Why? Show me your hand! Why? Why? Tell me how. How? Go. Useless fellows! Come here. Where is your homework? Show me your hand! [LAUGHS] Who’s laughing, eh? Who is that? Come here! Go sit. Write the formula from yesterday on the board. Hmm. Come on. Make it fast! Come here. You forgot the formula already. Why are you laughing? What’s so funny, huh? What is it? Show me your hand! - Sir... Sir... - Why were you laughing so hard? - It’s my fault, sir. Sorry. - Why were you laughing? Sorry, sir. Your brains are like the Bermuda Triangle. Information goes in and never comes out. Listen! Write this formula a 1000 times as imposition. - Hmm. - Go! Oh god! No! Hey! What if Bussu sir saw you? He’ll smack me for being with you. He who terrifies everyone at school... His name’s Nagendra Kumar. And when he takes a day off... We celebrate that day like a festival. One of my seniors resorted to black magic to see him dead. He doesn’t let any of his students attend tuitions. He takes it as an insult if they do. A Corporate College offered him a job last year. We prayed our hearts out that he accepts it. But Gods are not so merciful with us. Okay. What happened next? Grandma... Grandma... What is this? It is also a God’s name. Just write it a1000 times. You’ll be blessed. Mommy! Mommy! Did you speak to dad? Hmm. I did. He said we couldn’t afford that college. Why? Fee structure is very high in that college. He wants you to find a college that is in our range. Please, mom. I don’t want to go to a different college. I want to join in that college only. Please! It’s not just about the fee. You’re poor in Math too. But I’m focusing totally on Maths right now. I’ve improved a lot, mom. When do you have your Pre Finals? 12th February. Score 95 marks in Math. Huh?! I’ll get you admitted in National College. Deal? My mom wasn’t ready to be convinced. I called my dad and spoke to him. He said mom’s word was final. Everyone takes final exams seriously. But she compelled me to focus on the Pre Finals. Are you done? You ruined it. 1000 times. Can’t do it. Consider matrix A and B A equal to 1425 B equal to 9 minus 4 minus 2 Huh. Tell me. Then find A cross B and B cross A First, A cross B A cross B equal to Matrix A into Matrix B ‘Score 95 marks in Math.’ ‘I’ll get you admitted in National College.’ Mr. Vaman Rao... You’re clever in Math and I’m poor. Why? Did you have a literacy initiation ceremony in Basara? No. Do you eat raw ladies finger? No. Is your mom or dad a Math teacher? Uh-huh. Do you carry a 6 box lunch pack to school? No. Do you have a peacock feather in your Math text? No. You’re poor in Math because you do none of this. Renowned Psychologist Srikanth Acharya... Now you’re going into a sleepy, dopey, wonderful state of relaxation. You’re in a peaceful state of mind. Imagine a tunnel in your heart. Just imagine a tunnel. Can you see a book there? One Math book. That’s the Math text you highly fear. Slowly try to hold the book. No! No! No! Nagendra sir! Math teacher! [STAMMERS] He beats me. No. Relax. Now relax. Slowly open your eyes. Your teacher is the reason you fear Math. Your transferred the negativity towards him to your subject. First try to perceive him positively. You’ll automatically develop an interest in Math. All the best. - Happy birthday to you, sir! - Thanks, David. Happy birthday, sir. Happy birthday, sir. Huh?! Pre Finals question paper. [MUGGING MATH] Ugh! Damn it. [CONTINUES MUGGING MATH] It’s a subject I don’t understand at all. I couldn’t mug it up. If a micro artist like you is convinced... I’ll pass the Math exam easily. If you make slips on nails, pencils, pads and erasers... I can cover the entire syllabus. So you didn't come here for your girlfriend's gift? How will you see the micro letters with your eyes? A protractor with a fixed magnifying glass. Who the hell called you a kid, bro? Bro... Bro, please... Bro... Bro... Bro, please do it. Please! I’m asking you. Please leave me. I just want you to help with Math. I’m good at all other subjects. Please! You think I’ve got no cash on me? Look how much I’ve got. Wait! I’ll tell your boss about your love story. Please do that for me... We don't have the courage to do it. Will you do me a favor? What is it? Don’t tell anyone what I told you. After listening to your story I feel like helping you... But I can’t make micro slips for you. I used to work in a photography shop. My boss got me here to train me in micro art. I’m just a trainee. Only my boss can help you out... He has the skill to carve on anything. He can carve up to 24 letters on a rice grain. Oh no! Your boss will call the cops if he finds out. Uh-huh. What are these, bro? I’ll tell you. Wait. Why did you leave the shop? A Math Professor visited after you left... He wrote a new book... He heard you’re a great micro artist and came to us. I got this photo frame ready. He wants everything in that book carved on this frame. He said the book is highly useful to all the students in our country. In the 30 years of my service... I got chance to do something good for the first time... Well done, Rafi! My boss agreed. Where did you go? Your mom called me several times for you. Did you tell her what I told you? I did... But I feared she’d get suspicious and come home. I’m here now... Don’t feel tension. Hmm. So, what gift did you get for Varna? Suspense. You stay here. I’ll be right back. Okay. Take it. Check it out. You are cheating now because you know the questions... How will you manage final exams? This is the paper Bussu sir prepared. This is all I need to clear the Finals. So will you cheat in your Finals too? Yes! Bro! Bro! No. No. No. Return it. - No. It will be a problem. - No. Go return it. Ugh! I’ll be in trouble if he’s caught during Finals. Why don’t you get it? - It’s going to be fine. Give it to him. I shouldn’t have told you about that idiot. I thought he is cheating only in pre-finals... I would've refused if I knew you’d cheat in your Finals. Take it! I'll pray to God that you don’t get caught. In case you’re caught... Please don’t take my name. I won’t. I promise. Thank you, sister. Mahi! Your Math exam is today, right? Yeah. Did you prepare well? Yeah. Do well in your exam. Hmm. Pre-Finals are just a practice test for Final exams... In case you plan on cheating... You better show yourself. If I catch you instead... The punishment is going to be harsh. Now you can start. Get up. Come on, get up! Step out. Now come on. Time is up. Get me the papers. Why are you so tensed? Our Pre Finals results are out. I saw it on the notice board. Really? - Let’s go check. - No. I want to skip this. You go. Why? You just go and see my marks. If I score less than 95 in Math, don't tell me. Hmm. Okay. All the best! Move aside, guys. Let me check. Hey, move! Hold on. Huh?! First language, Second language, English and Math... Buddy, you didn’t score 95 in Math. Damn it! You scored a 100! - Huh?! - Hmm. You topped our class in Pre-Finals. Yay!!! Hey! "The day you grow a moustache The day you get beaten up" "The day you feel youthful It's the last day of high school" "Let's blow off the pressure from 5 years" "Let's be rid of the hard times back here" "Let's bid adieu to the times spent in fear" "Let's groove away hoping for a better tomorrow" "I wish to join you in 11th and 12th grade" "I wish to read out my poems for you" "The day we shift classes The day we build muscle" "The day we feel too full of ourselves It's the last day of high school" Even the poor students score 70 percent these days. I expected you to do really well... And paid the Pre-Admission fee in college. These are just Pre-Finals, mom. Not the Finals. Are you going to do wonders in the Finals? You’ll score around the same percentage. Where are you going? To take refund from the college. Bye. Bye. My.... Bracelet. Hey, boy! Nagendra sir is calling you. I checked your past academic record. All these years you were just an average student. Passed just on the edge. How did you score 100 percent in the Pre-Finals? Hmm? Did you cheat? Tell me! Did you cheat? Tell me! Yes! I cheated in Pre-Finals. The reason I cheated is you. The reason I hate Math is you. Every time I’d open the Math book... I’d think of your boring face. Five years! Five years of my valuable high school life. It’s in vain because of you. Why do you dress like a scientist? Don’t you have any other clothes? Everyday in your life is the same... Even if you live for a thousand years... It doesn’t matter. Thank god! I vented all my anger from 5 years. Now I’m feeling so relieved. You just guessed that I cheated. But you’d take a gazillion years to prove how. Bye. Stop. I called the mobile number on the back of your bracelet. Micro artist Eega Damodar... He told me everything about your photo frame. I wondered how you know the question paper I prepared. I was clear when my file was displaced in the car. Hall tickets are issued. You’ll give your exams and go straight to college. You must have thought I can’t harm you, right? Your examination center Principal Sunil Sharma... Is my classmate. I’ll make sure you don’t give your Final exams. Hey! Clean properly. Our seniors had fun and we have to clean? When we have fun next year, our juniors have do it for us. Eat. Hi! Is this your bracelet? I only gave it to Nagendra sir. All the girls in our class are waiting to grab your books. But you should give it to me. That’s because I did you a favor. Come... Come... Hey. Mounika! Yeah, ma’am. Coming. What are you doing there? Come fast. Okay, bye. Hey! Please don’t forget. My ambition is to join National College. Mommy! Mommy! Did you pay the pre admission fee? Would you leave me alone if I didn’t? Here’s the receipt. Do you know why I conditioned you to score 95 in Math? Why? Cut off marks were 95 last year in that college... - Really? - Yeah. Don’t be overconfident that you scored 100 in Pre Finals. Study well and score good grades in Finals as well. We’d have to lose our admission fee otherwise. But why? I asked them the same question... And they said they have no refunds. They don’t have a refund policy. We lost 10K on your admission. Pre Finals are just for practice, mom. I’ll score good in the Finals. Alright. Go to your room and study. Don’t you dare step out until the end of exams. Mom... Send her food to her room. I’ll be bored to study alone, mom. That is why I got less marks in Pre Finals. I’ll study with my friends... - Friends? - Deepika and Sri Vani. How much did they score? Deepika scored 90 percent. And Sri Vani scored 92 percent. You said Pre Finals are just for practice. How come they scored so much? They do combined studies, mom. Unlike me. Alright... Ask them to come home and study. Uh-huh. They go to the Central Library to study. I heard whoever studied there are top rankers. Why are you still scared of him? Buddy... I need to tell you something important. - What is it? Every time I’d open the Math book... I’d think of your boring face. Don’t you have any other clothes? What the hell have you done? Even our Head Master is terrified of him. How could you yell at him like that? You know his name’s Nagendra. Translates to King of Snakes. He’ll definitely hold a grudge. He’ll not let you go so easily. I’m already tensed. Don’t talk about snakes and grudges. Oh, no! If he saw me with you... He’ll hold a grudge on me too and fail me. I’ll leave. You continue. Bye. He yelled at him?! How could he do that? Hey, I told my mom you two scored above 90 percent. You tell her the same, okay? Hmm? Please. Hi. Hi. Where’s Mahi? Oh. He’s jumping around from the joy of topping the class. Mahi topped the class?! What’s his percentage? 95 percent. And he got a 100 in Math. 100 in Math?! Really? I could give you Math teacher Nagendra sir’s address. Go find out yourself. Hmm. Give it to me. Stop it. Where’s Mahi now? Look. There he is. I’ve got some urgent work. I got to go. Bye! Hi, Class Topper! Congratulations! How do you guys know? Vayunandan told us. We’re going to the Central Library for combined studies. Why don’t you join us? Why not? Obviously... Thank god! My Math is sorted now. You can clarify all our doubts. - Doubts? - Okay then. Let’s go. Come. I can’t come right now. I’ll join you in a couple of days. Meanwhile, take Vayunandan with you. He loves combined studies. Uh-huh? Hey, Vayu! Come out. Ugh! What is it, dad? Hi! Will you join them for combined studies? Combined studies with you? Yeah, sure! Is Mahi coming? Uh-huh. Mahi is busy. He is not coming. I can prove 7 is an even number. What?! 7? How will you prove it’s even? It's simple. S-E-V-E-N. Seven! Remove the ‘S’ and it’s ‘Even’. - Hey... - Hmm? Can you solve this sum? Vayu, can you solve this? I don't know. What about you? Okay. Let’s go home and try. Whoever finds the solution gets an ice cream treat. Okay. What are you doing here? Is this the ice cream treat question? How do you know? If you want to work hard instead of cheating... I’ll be your tutor. Decide and meet me tomorrow. Go. He asked me to come. Who’s he? Address him as ‘Sir’. Learn to give respect. What are you doing here today? He told you to come tomorrow. I didn’t want to waste time. Keep cleaning the car... Let me ask him. Hey! Clean it. Come, he is calling you. Stop over acting... Pull the shirt button off. Come sit down. Sit down! Now tell me. Which chapter is difficult for you? I don’t understand this. Don’t just say this. Call it ‘Sum’ or ‘Problem’. I see you’ve come this far in Math. You must be clever. Am I right? Someone must’ve told you this sum is important. You don’t need important questions at this stage... Just basics. Let me ask you a basic question. Green. Brown. Black. If we place these colors in a sequence... What would be the 522nd color? Go home, solve it and meet me tomorrow at the same time. Go. Bring Math texts from 6 to 9 grades next time. Hi, sister! Who are you, man? Sister... I don’t understand this sum. Help me. I’m not here to clarify your doubts. I’m here to enjoy my short vacation in the IIT world. - Please! - Uh-huh. Help him... I paid his pre admission fee in National College already. What?! National College? Yes. Of course. You didn’t have money when I wanted to join. How did you manage now? Your son is your favorite. That’s not right. I agreed because all his friends were joining there. Please, sister. Hmm. Go bring your notebook. Did you solve that sum? I tried so hard. I couldn’t solve it at all. I tried too. I failed. There’s something wrong with this sum. Such difficult questions will not be in the exams... Forget it. - Hi. - Hey! Hi! You said there’s something wrong with the sum. See. Wow! Who told you about this? Vayunandan told me. Where’s the ice cream party? Oh. You told him about the treat too. Mom, bring me the pancakes quickly. Eat it. Yuck! Mom, the pancakes taste very bad. Hello! You don't like mom's pancakes? Pancake is great, mom. I was just kidding. I’m in IIT and I still don’t have a boyfriend... You have a girlfriend in 10th grade? Please give it back, sister. Please! Please! I will. First introduce her to me. No! No! Never! That’s not possible. No! Mommy! Hey! This is my sister Swetha. Hi. Hi. What’s up? Group studies? Hmm. Mahi is an expert in Math. He easily solves all the difficult sums. Hmm. He solved an impossible sum in a snap. And he solved it in just 4 steps. Verna is the smarter one in our batch after Mahi. Which college are you guys joining after 10th grade? Verna got a pre admission in National College. We’re yet to decide. I somehow feel you’re all grown up. You’ve decided on your college and girl. I don’t know how your future looks to you. Do you want to know how I see it? Verna will find out the truth about you and hate you. And you’re in pain from the whole incident. Think about it. Bye, grandma. I’ll be back soon. Okay, dear. Take care. Okay. Let’s go. Hey, Mahi! Sister is leaving. Let’s go. Come. Mahi! Mahi! I’m running late, mom. I’ll leave. Bye, mom. Swetha, stop! He’s here. How long are you going to manipulate her? She’ll have to find out someday. If you think she’ll never know... You’re the biggest fool. Bye. Here you go. 6-7-8 9... Good... Well done. Why do you need these now? Don’t you want my books next year? Yes. Then don’t ask me any questions. - Hmm. - Bye! Do you know ‘Unworthy Alms’ mean? No, sir. Go find out. I don’t have a place for someone unpunctual. Sir, please. Sir! Sir! - No! - Sir! Sir, please. I’m so sorry, sir. I also brought 6 to 9 grade texts like you asked. Please, sir! Did you finish the homework? Yes. 522nd color is Green, sir. Hmm. How’d you solve it? Show me. What is this? Hmm? This reminds me of a real incident. A teacher in Germany Told his students to add numbers from 1 to 100... And asked them for an answer... Students immediately grabbed their pens and started adding... But a student gave him the answer in just 10 seconds... That sum would take a minimum of 10 minutes. Both the students and teacher were shocked. Assuming his answer is definitely wrong, teacher opened the notebook. But the answer was right. That kid thought differently than everyone else. What did he do? He divided 1 to 100 numerals in 2 equal parts. 1 to 50... 51 to 100... When he added the highest number 100 to the lowest number... He got 101. Similarly, he added 99 and 2. The answer was 101. 98 plus 3. The answer is again 101. He thus recognized he’d have 50 counts of 101. So what did he do? 101 multiplied by 50. The answer was 5050. Mathematics involves lot of logic. Putting me aside... Is there another reason why Math disinterests you? Come on, tell me. Every time you teach Math... I’d think to myself if I’d ever apply these in life. Do you speak English well? - Yes, sir. Every day. - Okay. How old are you? 15. 15 is Mathematics. English could be a International language. But Mathematics is a universal language. We just know the distance between Earth and Sun is 149.6 million kilometers But did you ever get a doubt how they measured it? Hmm? No, sir. Trigonometry. Through advanced trigonometry, you can measure any heights... Any distances from anywhere to anywhere. We use Math in several aspects without our knowledge. We can’t imagine a world without Math. Correct answer. Yes! I did it. I did it on my own. I did it! I... I... I did it! Yes! Mathematics is a universal language. Mommy! There’s no salt or spice. This is so bland. You’re so poor in Mathematics. Come. Let’s go for a short drive. Hey! Come on. Let’s play football. Come. Come. Bend it like Beckham! Come on! What are you thinking? - Sir... - Come on! Kick it! Come on, kick the ball. Ah, come on, man! Kick the ball! Do it now. Yes. There it is. Come on. One more time. Here comes the kick and... Yes! It’s a goal! Mahi... Students must be having some nicknames for teachers... What’s mine? Hmm? Tell me. Come on. Ah, tell me. I won’t mind. Now come on, tell me. No problem. Don’t hesitate. Tell me. Tell me. B... What’s that? [STAMMERS] B... Bussu sir. Bussu? Couldn’t you find a better name? Huh? Bussu?! It’s alright. We also had nicknames for our teachers in school. Hey, boy. Pass the ball. Thanks, man. Here you go. Have some tea. Mommy, tea tastes great. Now you’re so good in Math. Didn’t Varna come today? She won’t be coming today. She has a stomachache. Walk slowly. Keep to the left. Hi, grandma! Hi, Deepu. Where’s Varna? She’s sleeping. Hello, Princess! What are you guys doing here? We’re doing the group study at your place today. Guys, I'll tell you a joke... When a student saw the question paper in the exam hall... He was feeling bad as he doesn't know any answers... Then the examiner told him... To cover his paper as the person sitting behind him is copying. Hi, daddy! Hey, hero. Get ready... I'll drop you at the exam hall. In Part B... Let me see. Hooray! Exams are over. This is the happiest moment in my life. Stop being so obsessed! Your exams are over. I’m interested in studying... Is that your problem? Go on study... Oh, Lord! Hey, Chinna! Ugh! What is it? Hire a servant to do all your chores. I can't do it anymore. Your grandpa prayed to fulfill a ritual on your birth. His prayers came true. But he couldn’t fulfill the ritual. Every time he would save money... It would go into the house expenses. Years passed by... It was soon before he passed away. Every time you ask when I’m going to my husband... I’d feel bad about not fulfilling his promise. Grandma! Hey! Hey! Hey! I can only love you... I can never hurt you. Here. The 2 rupees you threw away. Lord hopes for those very 2 rupees. Maybe Lord asks for my devotion instead of the ritual. You might have stolen money from the offering box. But you bought me the books from your own pocket. Fulfill the ritual on your own. Come. Let’s offer those books at the temple. Take it. Put it in the offering box. Results for 10th grade exams held from March 24th to April 9th are out. Andhra Pradesh Education Minister announced them at the Secretariat at 10:40 am. Sripathi Kumari topped with 591 marks. Avansha Varna came second with 587 marks. Varna! I knew you’d achieve it. Uncle, please check. Please! Looks like my brain is going to crash. Leave! - No, uncle. Please. - I said step out! Maintain queue. Stand in the line. Go. Hmm. Give it. No. You go first. Ugh! Let’s do Rock-Paper-Scissors. Umm... Okay. Rock-Paper-Scissors! Rock-Paper-Scissors! Oh no! Here. Take it. Next. 65, Math-67, Science-45... Total percentage-59.1! - 59.1! Wow! - Here. Take it. You passed... But your percentage is low. Bro, check in another site. 73... Total percentage 65! 0 in Math?! I cannot believe this. What?! Mahi failed in Math?! No way! Mommy... Question paper was easy, right? Why did you fail? Was my training not enough? What are you planning to do now? I’ll write supplementary exams, sir. Hmm. What if the paper is tough and you fail? Hmm? Shall we apply for rechecking? Rechecking? No, sir. Why? Why not? I feel you gave a blank answer sheet from the looks of it. I’m not taking a wild guess. Your exam center Principal called me. I was waiting for you to confess... But you were quiet... ‘Your student Mahi Teja couldn’t answer a single problem.’ ‘Do you have such dull students in your class?’ I felt so insulted by his remarks. I checked your Math answer sheets. I don’t get why you didn’t attempt the sums you know. I also enquired if Micro Artist Eega Damodar plays a part in this. But he was not there. I met his assistant Rafi... I threatened him and he told me your love story. That’s when I understood your game plan. You need to score 95 in Math to join National College. You checked the number of questions you can solve... And realized you can’t score 95 percent. That’s when you got the supplementary exams idea. You won’t qualify for supplementary if you score 35 plus... So, you've submitted blank papers. I challenged myself, ignored my ethics... Trying to get you through Math exam. But you wasted my efforts for a girl’s sake. I’m defeated because of you. Go to hell! Get out of here! Hi! I can’t believe you failed. You clarified my doubts and I got a State rank. I still can’t believe this. At least 10 corporate colleges are trying to reach me. One of them offered a free seat. While other offered a stipend. Blah! Blah! Blah! But I made a demand. Really? What is it? I’d join the college that offers free seats to my friends as well. You know something? National College agreed to meet my demand. Apply for a reevaluation without any delay... You just have to pass. We can all go to the same college. Wow! This feeling is amazing. Will you apply for reevaluation? Tell me! are you okay with it? Yes, okay. Bye! 'We can all go to the same college.' Go to hell! Get out of here! Hey, Mahi! Come here. - Sir... - Get into the car. Come. I’d scold you all the time. Did you ever wonder why I offered to tutor you? I thought you called me home to beat me up, sir. My wife lives in Bangalore now. She chose not to stay with me. She whined a lot about me before she left. You had the same complaints in the staff room. 'You’re life is a routine…' 'Even if you live for a thousand years…' 'It doesn’t make any difference.' When my wife yelled at me, I considered it her fault. But when you said the same things to me... I realized maybe I am to blame. Accepting my mistakes in your presence... I tried really hard to be positive towards my wife. But no matter what, that hatred I feel for my wife... I can’t lose it. But I had so many sweet memories with her. She was my college junior... I loved her at first sight. I’d get into fights on purpose and beat people up. Do you know why? Just to catch her attention. One day I saved her from seniors ragging her. And she shook my hand to thank me. I proposed to her that day itself. She took a week’s time and accepted me. Every moment with her has been joyful ever since. We got married to experience the joy of a lifetime. I was very happy to marry the love of my life. But that happiness faded in 5 years. Compliments turned into complaints. If you hope your first love stays with you forever... Happiness might or might not last. But if she stays in your heart forever... That happiness lasts for a lifetime. Every time you think of your first crush... Your heart skips a beat. I’m saying this with experience. Listen to me... Memories of first love are sweet only if you part ways. I don’t have the chance anymore. But you do... Mark my words... The important thing in first love is not winning... But keeping that emotion alive until you die. You will top the supplementary like you wished. I will tutor you. But you should make me a promise. You shouldn’t join the college she does. 'I don’t know how your future looks to you.' 'Want to know how it looks to me?' 'Varna will find out the truth about you and hate you.' 'And you’re in pain from the whole incident.' 'If you think she’ll never know...' 'You’re the biggest fool on Earth.' 'Memories of first love are sweet only if you part ways.' 'I promise.' 'You will top the supplementary like you wished.' 'I will tutor you.' Hmm. Come on. Promise me. "A meek smile that lures me" "Let me treasure it for a lifetime" "All the memories that amuse me" "Let them linger all through my life" "You're the suprise that stole my heart" "You've turned this young boy into a Prince" Hey! Why are you solving Math again? Didn’t you apply for reevaluation? - No. - Why? My Math teacher asked me not to. Why? If I clear the reevaluation by any chance... I won’t be eligible for supplementary... He said supplementary was my best option. 10th grade scores are really important, right? They reflect greatly on my life. That is why I decided to appear for the supplementary. Anyway, we as friends don’t have to join the same college. Even if we join different colleges... We can still be good friends. "Memories of first love when faded suddenly" "They're often sweet"
