Revised by Caradecuica I remember. Somebody! Somebody, please! Somebody, please! Help me! Somebody, help me! Please, somebody! I'm alive! Somebody, help me! Somebody, help me! Please, help me. Somebody... Help me! I'm alive! Somebody, help me, please! I'm Michael. Michael Rogan. What's your name? It is you. All these weeks I was beginning to think I was the only one left. Now, I don't know. Where are you from? I was born In Rhode Island. School, Dartmouth. A Master of Arts In English Literature. Gave me diction and a job as a barker on the Empire State Building. Empire State Building. ''We are now situated on a point 102 stories In the air, ''on the highest, loftiest, man-made edifice In all the world. ''Home of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten island...'' Now, that's where I was when It all began. I ran for the elevators, something hit me. I woke up. It was all over. I was the only one alive. In all of New York, the only one alive. I began to run. lt was a nightmare. The whole United States, wherever there had been people, that infernal radioactive dust, It choked and It killed and It... But there comes an end to running. Where were you? Where... I'm going hunting. I go every day. There's nothing to hunt, but I go anyway. I never had it so good. A house, food, no problems. Have you been sitting here all day? Come on Inside. Do you want to get sicker? You sure you don't want more? I want to tell you. I was In the hospital. They took me Into the X-ray room. All of a sudden, there was a strange noise. I don't know what happened after that. When I woke up, I was lying on the bed. Drink. I still don't know your name. Roseanne. The lead shield around the X-ray room. That's what saved you. Why did you come here? My mother's sister lives... Lived here. She was an artist. I came here one summer. I was so happy, I never forgot. Who was... the man In the picture? Steven. Husband? Yes. Do you mind If I stay here a little longer? I thought maybe I'd never see anyone again. Good morning. Good morning. I've been waiting for you to get up. I've gotta go get food. There's a country store down the road. It's about a mlle, so I'll be gone for a while. No. Take me with you. All right. People. Where are the people? There should be people! -Where are the people? -Stop thinking about it! Stop thinking about it! You hear me? Stop it! New York, Cleveland, Chicago... What I saw there was enough to crack my head open, but I stopped thinking about it. I'd look at it, and I wouldn't see it. That's the only way, the world that never was. Not even a mouse. These country stores, you got anything. Take what you want. Remember how important box tops used to be? My ma, that was her big dream. Tear off a box top, write 20 witty words and own the world. Mall it in with 10 cents in stamps, and you'll get rich, fat and famous. Here, madam, tear off a box top. Come on, let's get what we need and get out of here. It's getting cold out. I got enough for all night. All those years in New York, and I never saw the moonlight. I hated New York. It was like a trap holding. When I was a kid, we were so poor, hungry poor. Up in the country, hunger's different, but in the city, everything there... only a piece of glass... between you and what you need. It's done with. Roseanne, What about us? No, no, no! You little fool, there's only us. Steven! He's dead. I'm here. Stop! I've got his baby in me! I've got his baby! I'm almost out of everything. Get you some stuff tomorrow. Take me with you. Let's go to the city. Maybe Steven's alive. I don't know, but I've got to know. Soon I won't be able to walk so far, but I'm all right now. Please, let's go there tomorrow. Why don't you answer me? Do you want to kill yourself and it? Through some miracle, we're safe here, but in the city, how do you know what would happen to you and... But I've got to know about Steven. All right, I'll tell you. He's dead. They're all dead. Everyone! You and I are In a dead world. And I'm glad it's dead! Cheap, honky-tonk of a world. Wait! -I never expected to see anyone. -Why, neither did I. A young lady. I am Oliver B. Barn staple. I am assistant cashier at the Santa Barbara bank. How do you do? How do you do? Miracle. When we saw that smoke in the sky from your chimney... Another hour, and it would have been too dark. Was it pretty rough? The fire feels good. Yes, it was pretty rough. First getting locked in the vault, air got pretty bad. He's a pretty old man. Then when I found the inside release for the time lock mechanism... Then we got out, then we found everybody, everybody he'd worked with all those years. It wasn't easy on him either. I grabbed a Jeep. I used to drive one in the Army. We just went off. Went around in circles, I guess. I wasn't exactly what you'd call normal, either, for a while. I'd always seen the dead in their coffins. -Anyone want some more? -I am most content. Full up. Delicious and delightful. But tomorrow we must be on our way, eh, Charles? Yes, Indeed, vacations are delightful, but one has obligations to one's work. Sirius, Jupiter. I once bought a book on the constellations. An impractical investment. I never got a chance to look at it. We're quite an institution, you know, 3 quarters of a million in capitalization. Do you mind if I stroll out on the point and look at the glories of nature? One must enjoy one's vacation while one can, you know. Of course. -Be careful, sir. -I'll be quite all right. I... want to say something. What I said before, I don't know whether It's true anymore. We're alive, now those two. I don't know. I got a place fixed up down there. I think perhaps Mr. Barn staple had better stay here tonight. No, my dear young lady. No, Indeed. For 40 years I've wanted to sleep under the stars. I never did, you know. It gets quite cold here. It's all right, there's a couch. Come along. I am tired. -lt won't embarrass you? -No. On the way... did you see anything alive? Just a few birds. He keeps talking about bank statements. Yes, ma'am. Before he got sick... he was a pretty bright man in his cage, Mr. Barn staple was, but when he got out, found all the people he'd been working with just lying there, well, you might say he was sort of like a machine, with no one left to press the buttons. -We'll take care of him. -Yes, ma'am. -Charles? -Yes, ma'am? Did you have a family? Yes, ma'am. Excellent investment, a house. What's your husband's business? -He's an architect. -Excellent, excellent. We do a great deal of business with architects and builders. Our escrow department is most efficient. Did I fall down? I don't remember. I must have bruised myself. I seem to be bleeding under my skin. Many places. I think it's radiation poisoning. How do you know that? I don't know. I'm guessing. But after Hiroshima, the magazines ran pictures. It looks the same. -But you're not sure? -No, I'm not sure. Good morning. How's the laundry business? I can't turn off the faucet. How is he? Sleeping. Three days sleeping. Charles, can you give me a hand? Okay. Madam, I hereby tender my resignation. I am entering the broader field of the building trade. Miss, Miss Roseanne. Where'd you get all this wood? Forestry station, two valleys over. There's an electric generator over there. -Is that a fact? -Yeah. Electric light. Now, that would be something. Then maybe we could find me a washing machine. Then I could fix me up a meter, send me a bill every month. Of course, I wouldn't pay it, so that would force me to disconnect myself. Did you ever stop to think? A world without any bills. Charles, Charles! Hi. Michael, Charles. -What's the matter? -He's awake and he wants to go down to the ocean. Ocean? What are you talking about? He seems perfectly rational, but he says he wants to go down to the ocean right away. Oh, yes. -I think he's better. -Yes. -How about you? -I'm fine. I've never asked you before, but I've got to, so here goes, when does... I'm not sure. Three months maybe. Did I ever tell you? When I was a very young man, I always wanted to go to sea. I don't remember why I didn’t. He'll be all right. Coney island. What did you say? I was thinking of Coney island on a day like this. Do you know Coney island? There's people. Hundreds of thousands of them, jammed together, body to body, trying to get a little sun, a little fresh air, and I with them. I still see lt. What's the matter with me? Michael! Michael! Come on! Last driftwood on the beach. How do you feel now, mister? The last survivors. I have listened to the stories of your individual miracles. Now I'll tell you of mine. I was on the mountain when it happened. The mountain. Everest. Surely you heard of our exploration. No matter. I alone. lt was a great blizzard. For five days, I was marooned on the final ridge. When I returned to the base camp, 5,000 feet below, they were all dead. I made my way across Asia, to the coast. Again, I was the only living thing. I found a boat. I went to Hawaii. Again, a mountain of dead. I found a plane. I decided to try America. I ran out of petrol a few hours ago. I climbed Mount Everest. I alone. Always alone. Now there are you. We are quite the community. Mike, Roseanne, come here! What was wrong? He just died. I'll stay. You come back for us. No. I'll bury him here. You take Roseanne home. No, I'll stay. -Don't you think you'd better come along? -No. Charles, It's all right. He loved the sea. She shouldn't be climbing up and down that hill. She wants to feed the man. He's not that sick! What's gonna be with Roseanne when her time comes? I don't know. If my old father could see me now. Why? He used to wave the Bible at me and say, ''In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread.'' How about the bank? No sweat of your face? ''Good morning, Mr. Harrison. Good morning, Mr. Adams. ''Good morning, Mr. Palmer.'' What did you want to do, Charles? I wanted to be a teacher. Why didn’t you? Lost my way somewhere, I guess. First a girl, a decent suit, then after a while, I guess, what I wanted more than anything else was a little piece of security, 9:30 to 4:00, $38.50 a week, every week. Security. Well, how is the agricultural project going? We don't know if the seed will grow. Why not? Things are so strange. Birds, no animals. So many things I don't understand. -How do you feel? -Fine. I think I'd better see how the farmers are doing. Isn't that a misdirection of energy? Why this return to primitiveness? The shelves of the cities are bursting with food, a lifetime of food. Michael doesn't want to go near the cities. Do you want to stay here? I have to now. I mean, after your child. I think I will try to get up tomorrow. That's wonderful, Eric. You're very sweet. Everybody, come on! Hurry, come on! -Take it easy. -What could it be? It's growing at last. So. Pretty good for city folks, huh? Corn on the cob. I was a fool. That long, terrible trip to reach here, endless days at sea, alone, always alone. Now I have found my civilization. As long as things keep growing, everything will be all right. Yes, I know. Nature so arranges it that when a woman ls in your condition, clouds are like rainbows and all the world ls like a cradle. Hey, they're on! They're on! How wonderful! Music. I wanted it so much. We found a hundred records. I wish I could dance. Me! You sit. I'll do it for you. It'll keep burning. There's plenty of gas In the generator. I keep thinking how I never saw the lights. All my life In the city, and I never saw them. Very nice! And here I thought you were sewing booties. -lt is very nice. -Thank you. You have done enough work for one day. Come outside and talk to me. I'd like to finish the sewing. That corn out of the can was mighty tasty tonight. The blessing of our age, the American canning industry. And yet, it debased your taste downto the level of baked beans and hash. I didn’t notice any leftover beans on your plate tonight. When in Rome, eat swill like the Romans. I'd like to go places tonight and have a big time, order a double-decker hamburger with onions, a side order of French fries and a double chocolate malt. Spareribs. Barbecued spareribs. I can smell them. I'd like strawberries, strawberries and cream. Where I lived, the smell of traffic. From morning to night, you could smell the traffic. Telephone. If I could hear a telephone ringing... A New York cop, even a New York cop bawling out a hack driver. Where I lived, the faucet was always dripping. If I could just hear that dripping. Of all those things, which would you like the most? I don't know. Kids raising the devil around the supper table. I hardly think this is the time for nostalgic sentimentality. I've been giving a great deal of thought to why we are alive. Of course, there's a definite primary reason why he and you and I escaped the radiation. I was at a tremendous height and you two behind metal at the bank vault, the X-ray room. And, yet, what about you? You had no such protection. And what about the old man who died In spite of having the same protection as this one had? The answer to me is obvious. Immunity. Simply because there is something within our bodies, a chemistry which gives us special immunity to that which killed the others. I see the doubtful look on your faces. Then mark this: during the Middle Ages, when the Black Plague swept all Europe, when man died by the hundreds of thousands, why didn’t all mankind die? The deadly organisms were there. There was no protection against them, and yet a small percentage of people lived on, as we have lived, with the rest of the world of men dropping dead around them. The answer then was immunity to the organisms, and the answer here today is immunity against the radiation. If what you say is true, then there are others. Of course. Throughout the world there will be others who have our sort of immunity. Not many, only a few perhaps, but very definitely existing as we are here. Some will die from the lingering radiations, but a small number will live as we have lived. -That gives you hope, doesn't it? -Yes. Well, that's just a theory, and a theory's just a bunch of words set front to back. But a theory becomes a fact with proof, and that is the very reason we should go into the cities and look for these people who might be alive. We'll never know waiting here. She will never know if her husband is dead or alive. Tomorrow will be a good day to start. Don't you agree? She's not well enough to travel. Anyway, we're safe here. We don't know what would happen to us in the cities. Michael, I was thinking, with your primitive mind and timidity, In a few years, you'll be swinging from the branches of the trees. Fortunately, I, and I believe I speak for Roseanne as well, am not quite satisfied with this return to nature of yours. Not when the cities are open, waiting treasure chests. Everything in the world is there for us, everything for the taking. And beyond that, what of the others who are alive? I want to get them together in one place. Why? So they can beat their heads on the ground for King Eric the First? The man who climbed Mount Everest? Michael, I do want to go to the city. If we drive carefully, I'll be all right. But you won't be all right. Don't you understand? It's the cities themselves. Where the bombs fell, the radiations are thickest. Why don't you listen to me? He talks about immunity. Have you got immunity to dead, piled up like cord wood with the flesh off their bones? I want to know what's happened out there, too, but Mike’s right. We don't know what would happen there. We know we're all right here. Who, In God's name, asked you your opinion? But I'm talking to her. And I'm telling you to shut up. I've had enough of this Interference. Where have I Interfered with you? That is the question. Your very presence is distasteful to me, that I must eat with you, sleep under the same roof with you. -Now It's out. -Now It's out. No, in this world, you must face really. It is a mistake he is alive. All right, let him go live somewhere else, not with you, not with me! Do you hear me? I want you out of here now. No! Eric! It's like lt never was before. ''And God stepped out on space ''And He looked around and said 'I'm lonely, I'll make me a world' ''Then God smiled And the light broke ''And the darkness rolled up on one side ''And the light stood shining on the other ''And God said, 'That's good!' ''Then God reached out and took the light in His hands ''And God rolled the light around in His hands ''Until He made the sun ''And He set that sun a-blazing In the heavens ''And the light that was left from making the sun. ''God gathered it in a shining ball and flung lt against the darkness... ''Spangling the night with the moon and the stars. ''Then down between The darkness and the light... ''He hurled the world ''And God said, 'That's good!' ''Then the green grass sprouted... ''And the pine tree pointed his finger to the sky, ''The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground, ''And the rivers ran down to the sea, ''And up from the bed of the river God scooped the clay, ''And by the bank of the river He kneeled Him down ''And there the great God Almighty Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky ''Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night ''Who rounded the earth In the middle of His hand ''This Great God ''Like a mother bending over her baby kneeled down in the dust ''Tolling over a lump of clay Till He had shaped it In His own image ''Then Into it He blew the breath of life ''And man became a living soul ''Amen'' Here he is. He. Thank you, Michael. I still think you should be In bed. Listen, mister, who's the doctor on this case? That's right. Don't argue with a specialist. Michael, is that the baby? I'll go see. -He was snoring. -He was not. It's all right. I told him to turn over. Roseanne, when are you gonna give him a name? Soon, I hope. Why not now? This is as good a time as any. You can't keep on calling him ''Baby.'' How about Guthrle or Glenn or Leroy? Yeah, or Ralph or Sylvester or Nathaniel or Gustaf... No! I don't want to name him now. I want to wait until I find out... about his father. Does your shoulder still hurt? No, It's doing fine. Where's Eric? He took the jeep early this morning and went off somewhere. I think we better talk about him now. He seems to think the fact he's sorry settles everything. As far as I'm concerned, nothing’s settled. Maybe the answer is for me to go away. Look, we've got too little a world left to run away. We're here, all of us. Eric’s got to understand that once and for all, and right away. And what if he doesn't? Then he's got to get out. Don't you agree? I don't know. I don't think it's right. You said there can't be anymore running away, and you're right. At the same time, have we the right to send anyone away? Anyway, the way I've got it figured out, it isn’t me or you he hates. He's right, Michael. Well, this is an occasion. -How do you feel? -All right. I brought you a few things. Thank you. I found a place over the ridge. Some wealthy man built himself quite a beautiful place. Many things there we could use. We've been talking about you. Is that a fact? I think I'll go In. Thank you, Charles. Thank you for the things. Not at all. It's very nice to see you up and about. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you. Yes? I said we've been talking about you. You're repetitious. Listen, Eric. Maybe we're the only ones left on Earth, and well, maybe it's true there are others left besides us. Either way, It's like the world was starting all over a Gain. We've got a new chance... to make the world what everybody used to talk about. We've got that chance, let's make the most of it. Let's not make the mistakes they did, the millions of them. Let's not be at each other's throats. Let's work together, live together, like friends. May I have a cigarette? Look, Michael, we've all been living under a great state of tension. That is my only excuse for what happened, but I think lt is a valid one. The tensions are over. What more can I say? I've got to fix the roof tomorrow. Will you give me a hand? Of course. -Do you need help unloading the jeep? -Yes. I'll give you a hand. Thank you. I'll be with you In a moment. That crazy idiot. Why does he do it? Some people have to climb mountains to justify their existence. Sit In the shade. How about you? Aren't you happy here? Yes. We could be happy now. I'm full of so many things to say to you, I lost them all. Roseanne, listen. I'm just an ordinary guy who happens to be here. I thought I was alone, and it didn’t matter much. People hadn't meant much to me. When you first got here, well, you were just a woman, but now you're Roseanne. I think of you when I work, when I plan, so much I want to do. Oh Michael. Those filthy scavengers. I saw them In the city. It's getting late. It's Charles! What's he doing down here? The baby! Charles, is the baby all right? is the baby all right? Sure. Sleeping. Eric? I saw him from the terrace. -Deliberately drove the jeep through lt. -Charles! -ls he all right? -Yes. -How terrible! How did... -Animal. We don't know what kind. Why did you do it? Why did I do what? Charles worked like a dog to make it grow. Why did you do it? All the food we could possibly want is in a thousand warehouses. If the man persists in working like an animal, let him work. I was tired. I took the short route back. Get out! Get out now! I'll go. In my own time. It sure is hot tonight. Sure wish we could find us an electric dishwasher. We're going to get dishpan hands. I told him to get out. What did he say? He showed me a gun and said he'd leave In his own time. He's sleeping. Did you finish the dishes? All starched and ironed. Why didn’t Eric come up for dinner tonight? Guess he went off somewhere. Well, he'll never know what he missed. What's the matter? Was there ground glass In the soup? No. That was a mighty fine dinner. I'm just so full I haven't got any room for conversation. Good night, everybody. -Good night, Charles. -Good night, Charles. What's the matter, Michael? I want to tell you something. What you said today... made me very happy, like I used to be. I forgot everything except being alive, being with you. Oh, Steven. -Yes? -Eric. I've got to talk to you right away. I'm very tired, Eric. I'm going away tonight. -Tonight? -Yes. I've got to find out once and for all about those other people. I owe it to them. I owe it to myself. -Will you be back? -Yes. Of course. In a few days. And then I'll know once and for all where we stand. Your husband... If I find him, I'll bring him back with me. We're a group of living miracles, why not he? Yes. What am I talking about? I don't even know what he looks like. I'll go with you. I have the jeep packed at the bend of the road. Shouldn't we tell? No, definitely no. Michael... who knows what he will do or say? Now we can go without any quarreling, come back, there'll be no trouble at all, but of course we'll take the child. Come. Pack your things. I'll meet you at the jeep In 20 minutes. All right? -Yes. -Good. I thought I was the only one who couldn't sleep. Where you going? What's wrong? What's happening up there? It's all right, darling. We'll be going soon. I'm sorry. It took longer than I thought. Was anyone awake? No. Well, we're really on our way. Too bad you can't drive. Let me sleep until I wake up. Roseanne! Roseanne! Steven! Steven! Where have you been? Get In! Get In! You should have been with me. I told you... the whole world, a waiting treasure chest. Could we go now? I'll get something better. Ever think you'd own the world? -Couldn't we go back now? -Back where? You little fool. I got you away. You don't think I'm gonna take you back? I'll get another car. Where do you think you're going? Get back In that car. Come on! Stay with me as long as I want you! What's the matter? What's the matter? What's the matter? There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing! Roseanne! Roseanne. My baby's dead. If you could cry. I want to help you.
