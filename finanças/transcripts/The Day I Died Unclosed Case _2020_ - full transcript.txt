We have some breaking news. Typhoon Rappa is moving northward and developing stronger winds. With a wind speed of over 47m per second and spanning 350km, it's expected to impact the entire peninsula. (I apologize on behalf of my father and brother.) (Goodbye.) (THE DAY I DIED: UNCLOSED CASE) (Two months later) I represent various cases now, but I used to specialize in divorces. I heard a settlement will be hard. You'll sue him, right? Do you want to forgive? If your husband admits to his faults, you want to end things nicely? Is that it? Instead of... clients who cry and are angry, it's harder to represent those who aren't ready to fight. You may wonder how this happened. If he planned for this, it happened because of him. What else could it be? Why would he apologize to you? Why? How did this happen? Why didn't I know? Could that be an excuse? Will I ever stop wondering? If I go back to work, will I be able to forget it all? Can I live as I did before? Let's see. We don't want your arm to go numb again like when you had the accident. The X-rays look fine. No paralysis. If it hurts at all at work, come right away. A relapse takes longer to heal. Yes? Have a seat. You've applied to return? Yes, ma'am. How do feel? Is your arm numb? It's fine now. If you try to return to work with no good reason, your chief won't take you. And there's the disciplinary hearing. I'm expecting that. Surprised that I called you in? Wearing your uniform... You were the team's ace. It's too bad it happened when you were about to be promoted. I know your chief overreacted to avoid any responsibility. No one died in the accident, and it was a minor collision you caused on the chase, right? It's unfair to lose everything you worked for due to that. Are your personal affairs in order? It's in mediation. Good. Know what people come to disciplinary hearings for? Sexual assault and bribery. I don't want you to be disciplined along with jerks like that. Write up a case closure report before your official return. There was a girl under witness protection. She jumped off a cliff on an island where she lived. It was first ruled out as a suicide. She jumped during a typhoon, so her body was never found. A suicide with no corpse? There's a will and other circumstantial evidence. The prosecutor got consent from her and her guardian and had her take a rest on the island. It's a headache. The trial was postponed, and the prosecutor was replaced. The brass is worried we'd get all the blame. Check the preliminary report. Add more witness accounts and wrap it up for me. If so, I'll put in a good word at the hearing. No need to decide right away. I'll do it. Where's the island? (Safe Sea, Happy Citizens) Good morning. - May I help you? - Hello. You're early. Have a seat. Sure. (Typhoon Rappa Damage Report, Gawol Island) We escorted her to the island but didn't know any details. That girl, Jung... Right, Se-jin! She never left the island. At first, an officer in charge came down regularly. He'd contact the village chief directly and went there sometimes. But later, he said he couldn't come anymore, so we sent people to her sometimes. Just to deliver stuff she needed. We didn't meet her for other reasons. I see. After what happened to her, we helped search everywhere. But the typhoon was so strong. Against that cliff, the waves crash and then pull out, so we couldn't find her. (Typhoon Rappa Damages) Everyone in town sailed out to look for her without pay. Did they verify the will? Yes. It was her handwriting. That settles it. We have lots of suicide cases here. I see. The village chief will take you there by boat soon. Officer Kim! Why is the wind so strong? Chief! Was it supposed to be this windy? This is the only place to dock boats. During typhoons, the boats are all tied up here. I see. There were CCTV cameras here and there. They were taken to investigate the case. Who owns this house? It's Sun-cheon's house. Did the girl know Sun-cheon before? No. It was Sun-cheon's brother, Dong-chul's house. After he died, she took great care of it. This is the best vacant house around here. I helped her rent it out. She didn't know the girl. I'd like to meet her too. But she can't speak. They said not to touch anything, so it's left as is. She lived here for over six months before the typhoon came. The will was left on that desk. Right here. It's where she jumped. That's what we're guessing. Now, over here. We found her shoes stuck here. Then we found her jacket over there. See? It looks calm and quiet now. But when a typhoon hits, see those black rocks? Water fills up to there. Anything swept away can't be found. How did you know they were the girl's shoes? Please, Detective. She's the only one who would wear shoes like that around here. The people on the island knew that she was here? They told me to keep quiet at first. But she stayed here for so long. How could they not know? Is there a house past there? Most folks live near the dock. The girl stayed down this way. Sun-cheon lives down that way. The other homes are all vacant. They asked all this last time. Sorry to trouble you. Please speak comfortably. Can you start from the first day she arrived here? I think it was last winter. At first, her sister and brother-in-law came often. She never came out of the house for a while. Then she'd come out and stuff. Why did you go to the house that day? - After the typhoon? - Yes. I got so worried. No one would come out. I called, but there was no answer. Why aren't you answering? Chief! Chief! I can't breathe! Something terrible must've happened! I went all around to check on my nets. Then I found these on the rocks! Aren't they the girl's shoes? What are you talking about? Chief! She's gone! The girl isn't home! There's a letter on her desk! I have a bad feeling! The poor girl! Did she come here? - No, she didn't! - Let's go check! - Come on! - Oh, no! - Where would she sleep tonight? - I don't know. It's getting late. It's dangerous at night. You'll have to go in the morning. Where can she sleep? Don't worry. I'll sleep in that house. The electricity comes and goes there. It's okay. Good night. Detective! Wait! You'll be needing this. Thank you. Good night. She's a cop all right. I'm upset about your unfair situation. If you finish this job, I'll help with your disciplinary hearing. Hello. You must be the owner of this house. Do you know that the girl who lived here has died? Please don't clean. The investigation isn't over. I'll visit you the next time I come here. (Seonam Police Station) (On red, On left green arrow) Detective Kim Hyun-soo? How did you know I'm on this case? Well, it's important to us too. The site is important, so I went to check it out first. How is her brother? Since his only family member died, he's taking it hard. He's accepted that she committed suicide? Yes. Falling from that height, the chances of survival are slim. And her body was never found because of the typhoon, right? Yes. My job is to refer to the first report and explore all possibilities. If he'd like to come to the island with me... Wait. Mr. Jung Yong-jin is in confinement. - He's in prison? - Yes. He'll be released in December. I see. Why did you ask to meet? His sister took some expensive items to the island. This is the list. We ask that you hand them over to us directly. And if anything is missing, please find it for us. Sure. Please keep in close contact with us. I hope there will be no problems with Se-jin's death benefit payout. That's for you. We hope you eat well on the job. Thanks for the thought. But I can't digest well. I'll be in touch. - Waited long? - No, ma'am. Her brother's lawyer was just here. So fast. Asked to close it as death, not missing? He didn't mention that, but he talked about insurance and some expensive keepsakes. They weren't mentioned in the report, so I'll have to check. Good. As I mentioned, we don't want to take all the blame because word gets out. - Watch it. - Yes. You can wrap up her belongings. Say you're temporarily back. Yes, ma'am. (Seonam Police Station Accompanies You.) I saw Kim Hyun-soo. Wasn't she sick? Is she back? She went on sick leave to avoid disciplinary actions. Isn't she ashamed? What team would take a troublemaker? She pretended to be so smart. But her lawyer husband pulled one on her, so she lost it. Right! He claimed she had an affair with a junior officer. Hello. I heard my stuff was here. I'll greet you later when I'm back officially. She startled me. Jeez. You'll break the door... Will you look at all the CCTV footage? There's quite a lot. I should try. Were you on this case too? About the dead girl's father? It was a big smuggling case. (Case Report: Jung Se-jin) (Park Hyung-joon: Resigned, Kim Ji-young: Maternity leave) (Detective Park Hyung-joon) Who's calling? I'm Detective Kim Hyun-soo. Have you heard about Jung Se-jin? Yes. I don't know why you called. I'm not a detective or a cop anymore. I have nothing to say. I'm busy with something personal. - But... - Goodbye. Hyun-soo. Aren't you going to say hello? We're no longer teammates, is that it? Word travels fast. You can drive now? Yes, I'm fine. That's good. Congratulations on getting married. Sorry I couldn't go. That was a long time ago. We're having a baby soon. Forget everything and move on. - Just forget that jerk. - Some day... Let's have lunch. Sure. - Beer on the rocks. - You bet! - May I have more coffee? - Of course. The lawyer is good, huh? I didn't come to talk about that. Park Hyung-joon was on your team? Yeah. I know this girl. - This is the girl who died? - Yup. The poor girl... Was there a will? They think it was a suicide, but I want to be sure. You could've taken on this case. Park came after you went on sick leave. Never met him? Are you close? I got his wedding invitation, but I don't know if I'll go. I guess he's busy with the wedding. Did you see the girl? Yes. At the beginning. I quit in the middle of this case. I first met her when I went with Park to search her house. Jung Se-jin? Yes. Did something happen to my dad? Obviously, a rich kid who doesn't know the real world. Can you try calling your dad? Even after seeing her father on the news, she didn't know he was involved in smuggling. Does your father only use one phone? Yes. How old are you? I'm going to be in 11th grade. You're not a kid anymore. Something happened to his company, and we're investigating. - The pictures. - Sure. See these? Do you know anyone? Uncle Jin-hyuk came by yesterday. You call Kim Jin-hyuk "uncle"? Did he come alone? It was around this time. He said he couldn't reach Dad. He went to Dad's office to look for something. What was it? I'm not sure. He seemed angry. Did she have any other family? They got divorced when she was a baby. Her mother immigrated abroad. We couldn't find her. Her dad has no relatives. She was close with her stepmom. They weren't legally married, so she's not related by law. She has a brother in prison on drug charges. He doesn't care about his sister. He went nuts to get whatever assets left. Do you have to investigate her father's case too? Well, she ended up on the island because of her dad's case. The case went belly-up after her father died then Kim Jin-hyuk too. Think anyone will talk? I can't get a hold of anyone. Kim Jung-mi's number is disconnected. That girl, Se-jin... She would've done anything to stay with Kim Jung-mi, her stepmom. But if she didn't call after Se-jin died... Forget it! Did these belong to your father? Se-jin was a minor who didn't seem to know anything. So we called in Kim Jung-mi to investigate. We found traces of money laundering through Kim's bakery. Then Se-jin suddenly came to us. Se-jin. As you're a minor, a guardian must be present. But since that's impossible, we'll record this. Can't Ms. Kim do it? As you know, she's under investigation too. You asked where Dad's ledger was, right? You had it? Mister! Ms. Kim is innocent! That will prove it, right? She saw her dad hide the ledger in the boiler room. She hid it just in case. It had records on her dad and Kim Jin-hyuk's smuggling. All the names of everyone involved. The prosecutors had a party! So she revealed her own father's crimes. Right. So Se-jin became a key witness. Why send her to the island? We thought it won't be long. - This is her will? - Yup. At least it's straightforward. Wrap it up quickly and prepare for your divorce trial. Okay? You worked at her house for many years? Yes. Since Se-jin was in elementary school. I had no idea. Her father seemed like a gentleman. Ms. Kim was young but nice. How about the son? Se-jin's older brother? He said he was imprisoned because his father didn't pay. He didn't treat me as a human being. Ms. Kim... She moved to the next building because he harassed her. I worked at that house too. Did it seem like Kim Jung-mi and Se-jin's dad would get married? No, I don't think they would've. Why not? Se-jin took care of the household budget. She paid my wage and the utilities. Mr. Jung left it to Se-jin. Why do you think he did that? Was there any jewelry in the house that Se-jin might take? Well... Even if there was anything, they would've kept it hidden. - Enjoy. - Goodbye! May I meet the owner here? Ms. Kim Jung-mi? A new owner took over a long time ago. Do you have her number? I can take a message for you. Please say it's about Jung Se-jin. This is my card. I'd like to buy a cake. Sure. (Items purchased by Seonam Police that are to be retrieved) (Family's special requests) (Items to be sent to family) (On-site evidence) (Student ID Jung Se-jin) (Mirror) (Photos of her biological mother, Jewelry) The hearing is tomorrow. Your husband will just send a lawyer too. I thought you'd like to know. Let's meet when you get back. Claims to have nightmares and suffer from insomnia. Temporarily installed CCTV in the room to check sleeping patterns. (CCTV installed) She expressed strong discontent at violating her privacy. She demanded that the CCTV be removed. Requested to remove the tree that disturbs her sleep. Hello. Is today a special day? I brought a cake from Seoul, but it got crushed a bit. How thoughtful of you. Thank you. Will you sleep at that house again? Yes. I have to organize some things. I see. Detective, are you married? Yes. Really? Any kids? Why not? I'm not on good terms with my husband. Why ask her that? Oh, no! I'm sorry to hear that. We're getting divorced. It turns out he cheated on me for many years. Oh, my! His wife is a cop! How dare he? What a jerk! Damn jerks like him should be tied up and turned into fish bait! Mother! Ma'am? Do you know who cut the tree behind that house? The jujube tree? She said the sound of the wind scared her at night. Her brother-in-law picked all the jujubes and cut down the trunk. Do we have to mention that kind of stuff too? Yes. If you recall anything else, - please let me know. - Of course. Wait a minute. We're all gathering for a meal tomorrow. Come and join us. Thank you. I will. Promise? - Yes. - Good. Thanks for the cake! He cheated on her? She's pretty. Why? Who knows what happens - between couples in private? - Quiet! I don't even know my husband. I mean, she's pretty... Where did she go? Jesus! You scared me! Why did you go in there? I almost had a heart attack. Why didn't you call me? I came because you didn't come to eat. I'm sorry. Is it a village party? Not really. We sometimes gather like this for a meal together. She's here! Hello. - Come have some food. - Welcome. Come this way. There used to be a lot of folks, but this is it now. We haven't had a guest in a while, so we prepared a lot. Try it. She's my daughter-in-law. I hope you enjoy the food. It looks great. Thank you. But where's Ms. Sun-cheon? She never comes here. We'll take some food to her later. Does she live alone? She lives with a sick girl named Soon-jung. She's Dong-chul's daughter, Sun-cheon's niece. After Dong-chul died, his wife ran off. Sun-cheon's the guardian. The girl had sort of a stroke. She fell in the sea and almost died. She can't move or talk now. She'll be like that till she dies. Why you! Is it okay for her to be treated at home? It's been years. When social services said to put her in a care home, Sun-cheon put up one hell of a fight show. She's normally a gentle woman. But she changed once she lost her voice. - She could talk before? - Of course. Damn woman. Thinking her niece would die, she drank some pesticide. It burned her throat. Still, she's a good woman. She works at a farm so her niece can be treated even after she dies. But someone died in her house again... Why won't the girl's male cousin come around? - Her cousin? - Yes. - The one who'd bring her stuff? - Yes. - I heard he's her brother-in-law. - I know. But that man isn't related, right? Who? My husband saw them. We don't usually go down the path behind that house. Once, he went past there and saw the girl with that man by the cliff. It was near sundown. They didn't see my husband. He said they didn't look like in-laws. Excuse me? Anybody home? Hello. I came to deliver some party food. Wait, please. Could we talk, ma'am? I'm investigating what happened to the girl who used to live in your brother's house. Have you seen her walking around here? She watched... the sea. She got scared and ran. Did you see her often? Three times. Three or four times. Did you ever see her with the brother-in-law? You never saw him? You could've taken on this case. Park came after you went on sick leave. (Park Hyung-joon) Some CCTV footage, missing. Due to bad weather, returned the next day. Contacted library. (To Se-jin) (Buan Library) - Ms. Song Na-yeon? - Yes. Did you send this through Mr. Park Hyung-joon? Yes. Are you talking about Se-jin? Do you know Jung Se-jin? Yes. How do you know her? Well, I know she's not well. And she has no Internet there. Se-jin sent me a list of books, and I sent them to her. Se-jin wrote the notes herself? I think so. Is Se-jin seriously ill? She hasn't asked for new books, and she hasn't returned a book. She died. What? May I see her notes and the list of books she borrowed? But I didn't collect and save them. I'll take a look. Here. Is this the book she didn't return? Right. ("World Map to Choose Your Travel Destination") (Do you have any books on music or learning English?) I had no idea that Se-jin passed away. She always hid her feelings. Is this Se-jin's handwriting too? Yes. It may be her last note. She said she hurt her right arm. Injured her arm? She had it sown at a clinic. The clinic in this town? I think it was the boat clinic that goes around the islands. If you find another note or remember anything else, please call me. Wait. My cell phone may not work out there, so... Were you the one who treated her arm? No, he's not here anymore. The cut was deep, but she came with it wrapped tightly. He told her it'd be best to go to a hospital in town. She just took some medicine and gauze. How big was the cut? Probably about this big. It says he suggested seeing a plastic surgeon so it won't scar. Did it appear to be a self-inflicted wound? It says it's an injury from falling. Any record of anyone who came with her that day? There's no mention here. But she couldn't have come here alone. Excuse me? Ma'am? When Se-jin hurt her arm, you took her to the clinic boat, right? Do you know her body hasn't been found? She didn't talk much with anyone else on the island. I'm trying to find out what happened to her. Anything you say will help a lot. Did you see Se-jin get hurt? The clinic said that she injured it in a fall. I'm wondering... if it looked like a self-inflicted wound. Did she mention anything while you were taking her there? (I heard a pot breaking and went.) (Her arm was bleeding, so I took her to the clinic.) (She kept crying.) Thank you for that night. You don't have to come anymore. They'll put up the CCTV camera again. They'll bother you if they know you were here. I'm fine, so please don't come. Take care. Did she mention any names or anything at all? She said she had a nightmare. She came to my house that night. But she didn't say anything. To treat her arm, she would've had to rewrap it. It must've been hard to do it with her left hand. You didn't help? (Never saw her after that.) She didn't want her niece to be seen by anyone. Wrapping up the interviews here is the last of my job. I have everything to finish my report. Then, no one will ask how Se-jin's life was here or why she made that choice. But I know the look on her face. It's what I saw in the mirror for the past year. Left alone for no fault of her own, she will vanish in the waves and be forgotten by all. (Congratulations on giving birth. Baby's name: Jung Se-jin) It's the salted fish you liked. Thank you. So this is goodbye? Don't say that. - Are you all ready to go? - Yes. - Take care. - Yes. There! You look so pretty! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Goodbye.) Where are you? Your lawyer said you skipped your appointment. Are you crazy? You're here. Hi. Hello. You came earlier than I thought. I'm sorry. I forgot. Did you talk to Min-jung? She was worried about you. Please wait here for a second. Sure. A settlement is not an option. They're so stubborn. It's not worth listening to. We'll have to go to trial. We have proof of your husband's affair. But they also claim you had an affair with a coworker. Is there anything I should know about that? He was my junior and my partner. He's gotten married since. I'm not going to ask him for anything. They claimed that you didn't want to have kids. Is that true? I had an upcoming promotion exam. He's the one who said we could try after the promotion. We were both very busy. I see. Your husband's mistress is pregnant. That's why he wants to get divorced quickly. I thought you should know. Is that disadvantageous for me? No. You both want to get divorced. Division of assets is all that's left. You know your husband will try to pull anything he can. We have to prepare. I know it's hard, but you have to decide now. Know how much I worried when I couldn't reach you? I forgot. You forgot? How could you forget a meeting with your lawyer - at a time like this? - It's okay. I'm fine. I don't believe that. Not one bit! How can you be fine? Tell me! Right. How could I be fine? You said so yourself. How could I not know anything? But I really didn't. I thought my life was good, then it went down the drain. When I think about how I couldn't know he cheated, I can't breathe. But I've been okay for the past few days. I'll wrap it up soon. (Baby's sleeping. Please knock.) Excuse me. There was a CCTV camera inside the house at first. Did Se-jin request that? We all agreed to install it. After adjusting to the house, she begged to take it down. Can we really do this? I'll take responsibility for it. We took down the one in your room. Well, I have to change and stuff. I came here because it's safe, but what's with all the cameras? Bear with us. Then just go behind this line, then you won't be on camera. - Whatever! - Wait! Se-jin was closer with Detective Park Hyung-joon? I couldn't go there often. And he knew her from the start of the case. You should have a mirror. You like pink? - Why? - He took good care of her. Don't like it? He bought her stuff with his own money. Se-jin really liked him. Happy birthday! Wow! I had these when I was young. Let's see. When Se-jin first went to the island, she held on thinking she could meet Kim Jung-mi again. But she couldn't be reached after the investigation. How did Se-jin feel? Disappointed. She'd open up to Hyung-joon more than me. I'm so stupid. Why didn't I know? It's my fault for not knowing. Se-jin. Cooperating with the investigation is the only way to make it right. Did Dad really hide something? The prosecutor looked for anything her father may have hidden. Hyung-joon thought Se-jin knew something. But you didn't think she did? She's a kid. If she had known, she would've told Hyung-joon. I found this. Is this Hyung-joon's writing? There was no turntable. Why would he give her this? I'm not sure. Didn't it bother you? About what? She was a grown girl. When Park went to the island, the CCTV was off sometimes. And he slept over there more than you did. Didn't it seem odd? What are you suggesting? Hyung-joon worked hard on the case. It was Se-jin who was demanding. I pitied her, but she wasn't an angel. It wasn't his fault he couldn't go to the island. Se-jin. I know you're sad that Hyung-joon can't come. Where's the album? Your brother insists on having it. It's nothing. Just give it to him. No way! Try to find it and take it if you can! Se-jin didn't say anything about Park after that? You should know better. Don't make any guesses when you don't know what happened. I heard you experienced it too. Thanks to the groundless rumors, Hyung-joon had to quit. Se-jin once asked me to send a letter for her to Seoul. It was stamped, but I spilled coffee on it. I put it in a new envelope and sent it with the library mail. Should I tell you things like this? I was surprised. I heard she went to study abroad, but the letter was from a domestic address. Do you still have the letter? She said to throw it out right away. What did the letter say? She asked to send flowers to the woman she lived with. A bouquet of 40 white roses, I think. Did you send it? Yes. Were you her boyfriend? Why did she ask you to do that? It was just a fling. Why just a fling? I felt burdened. The lady bought me a new iPhone and asked me to be nice to her. Now that I think of it, she must've bought it with the dirty money. I felt bad about that and sent the roses. Where did you send it to? - Hello. - Hi. Flower delivery for Ms. Kim Jung-mi. Who? It says it's for Ms. Kim Jung-mi. - Wait, please. - Sure. - Hello. - Hi. How may I help you? I'm here for Ms. Kim Jung-mi. - I see. - Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. May I look around? Go ahead. Ms. Kim Jung-mi! Who are you? The one who sent that. Do I know you? Detective Kim Hyun-soo. I'm investigating Se-jin's suicide. You received that before, right? You knew that it was from Se-jin, right? Please stay back. I thought Se-jin didn't contact anyone before she died. Then I found out she sent that. I'd like to ask a few questions. Is Se-jin really dead? I was just thankful for not being sentenced and lived quietly in hiding. Se-jin's brother claimed I took his mom's jewelry and tried to sue me. If he finds out Se-jin contacted me... My lawyer said I wouldn't be able to see Se-jin again if things went wrong and told me to wait until she becomes an adult. Despite the risks, she sent it. Why didn't you try to reach her? I'm still scared of Yong-jin. I thought they'd take good care of her because they needed her as a witness. I heard the police and Yong-jin decided to send her to the island. The prosecutor and police thought Se-jin knew something more about her father. Any idea what it could be? I was with him for over ten years. I realized during the investigation that he didn't trust me at all. Se-jin kept asking if he really did what they claimed he did. She handed over the ledger herself. Why would she hide anything? You can't do this to Se-jin. The searches have been called off. Though her body hasn't been found, there are grounds to presume she has died. (Wedding Invitation: Park Hyung-joon) Yes? Come in. I saw your interim report. Close the case with what you have. I should meet Park Hyung-joon to... Did I ask you to reinvestigate? Still, my name will be on the report. Does your husband know you're on this case? Probably not. A reporter was snooping around. He didn't seem to know much, so there was no problem. That means he didn't hear it from the bereaved family. Your husband is close with the reporters. What if things go wrong again with your personal issues? Wrap it up so we can register her death. (Conclusion: Missing, presumed dead) From things that can't be changed, I wanted to be free. I didn't want to be a burden on anyone. I won't miss anything except for the sunset. If anyone discovers me by accident, I apologize in advance. This is the only way I could think of. I hope I vanish through the waves and never return. I apologize on behalf of my father and brother. Goodbye. Please walk confidently. Smile and relax. Mr. Park Hyung-joon? Someone is here to see you regarding payment. Oh. All right. My brother said he'd pay. I'm Detective Kim Hyun-soo. You didn't take my calls or texts, so I came here. What? I need to ask a few questions. - Now? - It won't take long. How could you come here? Do you want to talk here? You came to threaten me at my wedding? Why would I threaten you? I did this once. If it starts at 2 PM, you have lots of time. Do you think she could be alive? You know the island well. Then is the case closed as a suicide? I didn't find anything that says otherwise. What do you want to ask me? Though she was close with Kim Jung-mi, there's no mention of her in the will. She probably thought it was for Kim's best. There's no mention of you either. You personally brought many things for Se-jin. Would you like them back? After our honeymoon, we're moving abroad. (A-ra) I think you became close with Se-jin more than what people say. Whether by accident or on purpose. Think you know about Se-jin by looking at some files? Did her brother say that? Or the police want to blame everything on me? How dare you say that! She hurt herself after you quit! - What? - Se-jin slit her arm. I wanted to ask you if she called you one last time before jumping off the cliff. Because you're all she had. I thought at least... you'd wonder why she did that. But... it seems like you don't care about Se-jin's death either. Or is that good for you? Hyung-joon? Are you here? Where did he go? Don't go back to work. When did you last have a real meal? Instead of napping in your car, did you ever sleep comfortably? You're not normal! You just have to finish a report. What's with you? You went to a wedding to get revenge for a dead girl? Are you suspicious of Hyung-joon? What do you think he did? Your husband's lies about your partner! You went through hell because of those rumors! You're insanely mad about your damn husband! So let's go and spit in his face! Do it! Do what you want! I've barely gotten any sleep since I moved here. I have nightmares. I died. I see myself dead every night. Can't someone clear the body? Can't someone just bury me? That's all I think about in my nightmare. But if I don't sleep, I'll go crazy. So I take sleeping pills. When I finally fall asleep and wake up all drowsy, I wonder where I am. In the earlier CCTV footage, Se-jin is like that. But there are lots of signs showing that she fought to survive there. Then she died, and her body was lost. But everyone wants the case closed quietly. And I'm using the case to try to return to work. Focus on getting better before returning to work. Listen. - If you do that again... - Min-jung. Think I did that to kill myself? Think I crushed my arm to avoid discipline? No. I have to work to forget all the crap in my life. I thought I'd go crazy not working because of my numb arm! I did it in hopes to fix it! Not because I wanted to die. I did it to live. The girl must've been like that too, but there's no one. I met a lot of people. I wanted to find one person who would tell me she wouldn't die like that. But not one person said that. It must still be a dark night The glittering stars in the sky Sometimes look down on me It must still be a dark night Now, the passing wind (Conclusion: Presumed dead) Sadly embraces me Yes? Come in. Have a seat. I wanted to talk before the disciplinary hearing. I heard about Park Hyung-joon. - I'm sorry. - No. It could happen while on the job. Anyway, you closed the case well, so I'll keep my promise. But settle your divorce before you return. - Pardon? - It's a messy divorce. You'll have to explain to the committee all your husband's lies. Let's not dig up old bones. After your divorce... It's enough. It's enough that you gave me a chance. But... If I need to be disciplined, I will. I'll see you at the hearing. Wait... There's a CCTV camera here. Thought you should know. It's not good for you to barge in like this, you know? I came to say something. Isn't it too late to talk? It's too late to settle. I've been running away from this. I thought it was my fault. But I've changed. I'm not who I used to be. I'm going to fight you. I'll do my best to destroy you. I'll fight to leave proof that I fought. I thought I should tell you that in person. I heard you finished the case report. Thank you. Here's the full report. A list of her belongings is also in there. There was no jewelry. You must've been mistaken. And she must've taken the album because she didn't want you to have it. You must really feel sorry for my dead sister. Right? Not as much as you do. If you see her will, she apologized on behalf of her father and brother. We know about your father. But what did you do so wrong that she apologized on your behalf? Stop being so nosy, you damn cop! Stop it! Sit down! I'm sorry, Detective. Pushing the insurance company won't speed up processing her death. Stop whining. (Eat and take your pills.) The CCTV camera is back on, so let's stay behind the laundry line. If you knock, I'll come out. Look at all the food! Is today a special day? What? Birthday? Thanks to you, I get to eat yummy food. Thank you! (Lee Soon-jung) I thought about what to get you for your birthday. While staying at your dad's house, I listened to his music and read his letters in secret. The letters were all for you. I didn't know they were for you and got jealous. Wait. I have my mom's stamp collection. Seeing them, I thought I could go anywhere. Now, there's nowhere to go but here. Everyone I've been waiting for is gone. You asked for any mail for the former owner. I left it with security. (To Choi Eun-ju) (Mother: Choi Eun-ju) How often are the bills for the charnel house paid? It depends on the requested contract. Payments for them were made every five years, but they were recently extended to ten more years. Really? When was that? She came and paid in person. Do you check what's kept inside each of the vaults? No. It's not a subway locker. May I see the extension document? (Policyholder: Lee Soon-jung) Can I see the CCTV footage? The new section has new cameras. In the old section, the footage is kept for only two weeks. (Choi Sung-moon, Kang Yeon-sook) (Eat and take your pills.) (Her arm was bleeding, so I took her to the clinic.) Typhoon Rappa is moving northward and developing stronger winds. With a wind speed of over 47m per second... (Lee Soon-jung) (Identity Card Issuance Notice) (Disability Registration) What? (Go to Seoul.) I don't have anywhere to go. My brother and father did many bad things. I was too stupid to know. So I'm being punished. There's no one left. (You are left.) No! Why keep telling me to leave? I like it here like this! Let's just live like this. Go out... And live for us. Live. No one... Will save you. You... Must save yourself. Life is... Much longer... Than you think. The sea level is gradually rising. With high waves expected up to 9 meters... Let's... Stay... Strong. Chief! Chief! I can't breathe! I found these on the rocks! What are you talking about? - She's gone! - What? The kid is gone! - Oh, no! - I found a letter! (I made her do it.) I don't know what you mean. I came here because... I took this from the house. I came to return it to you. I'm sorry to have startled you. Please take care. (Disciplinary Hearing Notice for Detective Kim Hyun-soo) (Destroying and damaging company vehicle) She won't answer. What should I do? (One year later) Are you Korean? That waitress told me. Yes. Hello. Would you like to move for a better view of the sunset? Here's the menu. I'm done for the day. - Okay. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Are you getting off work? May I buy you a drink? Sure. Can I have a beer? Thank you. How long are you staying here? I haven't decided. This place will grow on you. Are you on vacation? No, I quit my job. I want to start over, but I don't know what to do yet. Someone I like said life is longer than you think. The tattoo is pretty. I did it to cover my scar. I can refer you if you'd like. How is life here? I was really busy working until last week. I didn't even have time to write letters home. You send letters to Korea? Yes. I know it's old-fashioned, but I like it. Will you ever go back to Korea? I have things to wrap up first. Is this the first city on your trip? No. I've been here and there. I wanted to check on something myself. Did you find it? What? What you wanted to check for yourself. I think I found it. That's good. Thanks. I'm more thankful. (KIM HYE-SU) (LEE JUNG-EUN) (ROH JEONG-EUI)
