(suspenseful music) (thunder rolling) (groaning) (grunting) - What's this? Running away? You mustn't do that. - Oh, god, please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, I was just -- - No, no, no. It's too late for that. (crying) Strangely appropriate, you crawling around on your belly, like that. It seems, somehow, natural. Wouldn't you agree, my friends? (sniffles) Take him. Take him back. - No, please! No, please! - Our work's barely begun. - [Man] No! (thunder rolling) (ominous music) (heavy metal music) - You see, you have to watch out for these freak show guys. Once you get in there, they charge you for everything. Well, that's why it's called a ding, because they ding the hell out of ya. (scoffs) - Haven't been to a spook show since I was six. How about you, Jeanie? - I've never been to a spook show. (laughs) - Well, I've been to a lot of 'em. Bobby and me go all the time. - Sounds like fun, huh? Right, Bobby? - Yeah, it's gonna be great. (clears throat) Let's get goin' here. - Let me give you a hand. (circus music) - Chamber of Horrors? Great. - This is gonna be terrific. - Hey, Bob. Can I explain the whole principle behind a double date? I manage to get Melanie, ice princess of the universe here, to go out with me. She manages to get Jeanie to go out with you, and then you bring your 15 year old brother along with us? - Look, man. What is it that you want me to do, okay? (sighs) I mean, the kid's got special needs. - Hey, well, so do I. And it doesn't look like I am gonna get la, hey! (clears throat) Okay, are we... Ready to go? - Yeah. (deeply exhales) (ominous music) (bird cawing) - Come on down. Three rings for a dollar, one ring on the post wins a prize. Come on, kid, show the little lady how it's done. (rock music) (laughs) - Well, Bobby and I have been friends since we were little kids. - [Melanie] That's nice. - [Tommy] Yeah, he's okay. I mean, not when he brings his little brother along, on a double date. (laughs) Hot dog? - [Melanie] Sure, I guess. - Two hot dogs please. - Everything on 'em? - No, just plain. - Two plain hot dogs. Thank you. (sighs) Hey, I wanna try that game out, over there. We'll be back in a minute. Come on, I'll win you a teddy bear. - So, Jeanie, corn dog? - Mm, popcorn? - Yeah, me too. Okay, three popcorns. - Hey, what do you want? You want one of those camel things, or a little, what about that little dog? - Come on down. Three rings for a dollar, one ring on the post wins a prize. Come on, kid, show the little lady how it's done. Win this girl a teddy bear, $1. Concentrate, now. Ooh, that was close. - Thank you. So, Jeanie, you and Mel are like friends, and stuff, huh? - Yeah, like you and Tommy. - Yeah. Tommy's great. Gets a little crazy every now and then, but pretty much, he's a nice guy. - I understand. I mean, it's funny. I see it all the time. - What? - You know, people like Melanie always a friend like me, and people like Tommy always have a friend like you. - Uh, like what? I don't get what you're saying. (laughs) - Like, for contrast. - I still don't understand. - I mean, if you wanna look really tall, you stand next to somebody short, right? I mean, don't get me wrong, I like Mel, she's great. We really are friends and everything. I just, I can't help thinking that part of the reason she hangs out with me is because, having me next to her, makes her look that much better. - Oh, come on. There's nothing wrong with you. With the way you look. I didn't mean it like that. - Right. Melanie looks great, and there's nothing wrong with me. - I didn't mean that. (laughs) Oh, I see, so Tommy hangs out with me because I look all eh, so now I'm offended. - Just forget I said anything at all, okay? It was just a thought. - You know, that's why Bobby wheels me around all the time. He figures next to me, even he looks good. - Mind your own business. - The only thing that would help me now is a complete body transplant. I mean, everything about me is just, know, other girls get tattoos and they look sexy, I get a tattoo, and it looks ugly. I mean, everything I do turns out horrible. There, you see that girl over there? I'd kill to have her body. - Yeah, me too. - Concentrate, now. Stay focused, stay focused. (thud) So close, and yet, so close. Take three more, just one more dollar. You'll win a teddy bear, for sure. - Look, I really don't want a teddy bear. - [Tommy] I just want to give it once more shot, okay? - [Man] Stay focused. - Hey, Tommy, you can't win at this game. (scoffs) - Says you. - [Man] Come on, now. (thud) - No, I mean nobody can. - Hey, look, I saw the rings fit on the posts, okay? It's stupid. - Tommy! - Damn! - Tommy, the way the posts are cut, you can slide the rings on by bringing them over the back of the post, to the front, but you can't throw a ring so it'll land that way. It's fixed, it's a rigged game. - Okay, you. Why don't you come out here, and show me how it's done? - Look, I don't want any trouble. Anybody has a problem, here you go. Money back. - Is it rigged, or isn't it? - Look, if that's how you feel about it, here you go. Grand prize. - I don't want a friggin' teddy bear! (ominous music) - Well, heck, I'm havin' a good time. Hey, Jeanie, this is for the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. - Well, aren't you the charmer? - You know, I think we better go after him. - Hey, cotton candy for everybody. Jeanie, Mel -- - I can't have any. It screws up my metabolism. - Yeah, that's why I didn't get you any. - Feeling better? - What? Oh, sure, sure. I just don't like people taking advantage of me. That ain't right. Anyhow, I guess Jeanie's got herself a bear. - You know, in carny lingo, they have what they call a lay bear. That's when the agent trades a teddy bear for a, a little sugar. (laughs) (clears throat) - Yeah, we get the point. (laughs) - Don't get any ideas, kid. - What? I wouldn't mind a little sugar. (scoffs) - What exactly is the problem here? Is it my breath? - I don't like being touched. - Well, you know, it's not exactly like I'm mauling you or something. (thud) (coughs) - I just don't like to be handled. I just wanna be worshiped. - Well that is what I'm tryin' to do. - From afar. (laughs) - Hey, watch it! - [Bobby] Hey, Tommy, watch where you're goin'! (laughs) - How about that? Are you okay, little fella? Let me help you up, come on. (grunts) - Tommy! - [Bobby] Hey, come on, man. - Come on, I'm just givin' him a ride. - [Bobby] Put him down! - Excuse me, would you please put him down? Bobby? - [Tommy] Well, how about it, little fella? You want to get down? - I'm afraid I'm in your power, for now. - Well, yeah. (laughs) Well, don't take any wooden nickels, and take care of yourself. - Sorry, mister. - He was just having some fun, okay? - Hey, come on. (sighs) Hey, I don't know about you guys, but I'm havin' a great time. - [Boy] Hey, look. It's a mitt camp. - A what? - A fortune teller. (laughs) - Come on. - [Melanie] What's the matter? Don't you want to know your future? - Wait! I'm looking into the future, I see myself. I see Melanie, wearing spandex hot pants. (thud) (laughs) - Hey, let's go, guys. (ominous music) - What now? - Welcome. Five fortunes, $5. - Hey, I'm a sport, my treat. - For you, to the sideshow. - [Boy] She palmed it. She -- - Dr. Graves' Horrors of Nature. - Oh, cool, a freak show! - So, you gonna -- - Everyone always asks the same questions about the future. What will the future give me? What will I get? And I shall tell you. You will get what you've always wanted, you will get what you've always dreamed of, you will get what you must have, and you will get all that you deserve. (laughs) - Hey, what the hell's that supposed to mean? - And you -- - Hey, lady, I asked you a question. - This reading is now over. - Oh, now that's a nice trick. (laughs) - I never got my fortune! - Hey, let's go check out the Horrors of Nature. Come on, guys! - Step right up! For $1, $1, you'll be terrified! You'll be shocked! You'll be thrilled! - Hey, look who it is. - Inside, just $1! $1! - Oh, my God. - For thrills, for delights! And now, our amazing attraction, Aelita, the Inside Out Girl! You think she's showing a lot now, wait 'til you see her insides! I mean, wait 'til you see her inside. Come on! $1, just $1! Thank you, Aelita. See more of her on the inside. See Hans, the Bug Boy, half human, half insect. Digestina, the woman who can digest anything, anything! There's more. Oh, yes, there's more, much more! For $1, $1! You can see Conjoino, you see one man, or two! You be the judge! Just $1, step right up! Step right up! Don't crowd now, don't crowd! Just $1, just $1! $1, $1! - Let's go! Let's go! Unless you want to wait outside? - Hey, I'm not scared, you know? I just don't like this sort of thing. - Hey, don't worry, I don't even think they allow 'em to use real freaks anymore. It's all, you know, just illusions. - That's right! - For all pass holders, that's right. - Come on. Got 'em just for fun, get your passes. - Horrors of nature! Your admission is 100% free, so step right up. Step right up, come on. Step right up! Take your time, don't crowd. Don't crowd! That's it! Move right along! That's it, come right on in. Come right on in. Don't crowd! Thank you, thank you very much. Yes, thank you! Don't crowd, don't crowd! That's it! Move right along, come right on in! (clears throat) (ominous music) - You see? That's a Fiji mermaid. - Looks like a dead monkey, sewed to a dead fish. - Yeah, well, that's what it is. I mean, the point is, basically, these shows are all fakes, but you know, that's just part of the fun. - Oh, well, I'm havin' a good time. How about you, Bobby? - Great. (clears throat) - Come on. It's all just for fun. Let's go! (thudding) (group chatter) - Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? Prepare yourself for the human marvel. What is it? Some say he was born with this tragic condition. The lightest touch of his skin was sheer agony, facing a life of endless pain. He wished his hardest to wear his bones on the outside, like an insect. Some strange power, perhaps God, perhaps something much lower, heard him, and granted his wish. Others say, his pregnant mother was frightened by a mosquito. (laughs) You decide! Prepare yourself for Hans, the Bug Boy! (group gasps) (dramatic organ music) (groaning) (glops) (yells) (group groans) (groans) (yells) (gurgling) - How'd they do that? - [Dr. Graves] Now, if I can direct your attention to this next performer -- - It's some kind of trick. - No mere words can prepare you for this. The hideous Conjoino, and his brother, Lester! (suspenseful music) - So, what's his problem? - There's nothin' to it. It's either a makeup appliance with a balloon, or... Something inside. (growls) - Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Boy, it's hot and crowded in here. There's only one chair, and I gotta fight the spleen for it, but hey, you can't beat the price. All my meals are free, too. All our insides are workin' together. Uh-oh, there goes my audience. - Bobby, where you goin', man? - I'm just through lookin'. - [Tommy] What's the matter, Bobby? - Nothin'. - So hold your horses. It ain't over yet. - And now, here's something really fun! - Hey, I could show you some fun. - Perhaps later. Ladies and gentlemen, come see the spectacle of horror. See the horror of nature, Digestina! Now, I imagine most of you will, and imagine you have, how shall I put it? An eating problem. - Tell me about it. - But our own delightful Digestina, has no problem at all. Of course, she's not your average eater. Most people restrict their food intake to the edible. Most people eat by way of their mouth, but Digestina does not limit herself to such mundane limitations. You see, she exists in a vat of digestive acid, so don't get too close! Oh, I should mention, that is not Digestina's only peculiarity. No, when you and I eat something, it's gone for good, but when Digestina eats something? How shall I put it? When Digestina eats something, it tends to stay with her. Digestina, do you remember eating that alarm clock last night? (clock alarm ringing) Didn't you have toast for breakfast? Digestina, did you eat the toaster again? - Sorry, Dr. Graves. - And what else have you eaten, that you shouldn't have? - Nothing, doctor, I swear. (bubbling) (group laughter) - [Dr. Graves] Digestina! (laughs) - I can't figure it out. How in the world do they do that? I mean, it has to be a trick. - Come on, let's go. - Hey, wait! (swanky jazz music) - Oh, my ego needs this. - Please, please! For the prudish among you, have no fear. This is not a striptease, at least, not the way you think. - You know, Mel, I could see you dressed up like that. - Although, I am compelled to warn you, that what you are about to see is not intended for children. - What makes you think I don't already? - Do we have any children in the audience? - This ain't my night. - Anyone? (yells) (whistling) Is there anyone not capable of handling the responsibilities of her, these actions? (laughs) - Take it off! - Very well, then. I present to you, Aelita, the Inside Out Girl. She puts a new meaning to the phrase, "Taking it all off." (laughs) - Take it off! - Take it off. Uh-huh, okay. - Take it off, uh-huh. Uh-huh, okay. Okay. (yells) - God, I wish I looked like that. (whistling) (group yelling) (group groans) (gasps) - Someone help her please. - [Jeanie] Now those are some great lookin' legs. - Come on, Mel, it's just a show. - Please, please, just don't touch me. (splat) - Alright, let's get out of here. Come on. Excuse us. - Hey! - [Bobby] Come on! - I want to watch! - Will you just listen to me for once? - No! - Fine, stay. - Hey. As long as you're not scared. - Go, explore! There are hidden corners, twists and turns. More wonders, more terrors, more horrors of nature. Go, discover them! (sighs) - Hey, come on. It's all just make believe. (laughs) You comin'? - What about Bobby? - Hey, I'm his friend, I'm not his babysitter. - I am not going, until I've seen the rest. I have been to 20 sideshows, and I'm telling you, this place isn't like any place else. That's a guarantee. - Hey. Hey, Jeanie? - [Jeanie] Hmm? - You wanna go see if Bobby's okay? - What do you mean? What's wrong with him? - He freaked out. He may have gone outside. Do you want to go and find him? - Oh, sure. Sure, okay. (deeply exhales) - Care to have a look, miss? - No, I'm just searching for the way out. - Oh, well, just go back the way you came. Keep turning to the right, or of course, for a mere 50 cents, this would be a much more direct way out. And, you would get to experience The Great Unknown. - Okay, okay, whatever's gonna get me outside. (clang) - Thank you. (door opens) Care to try it? - Sorry, I don't have the time. - Not enough time to perfect yourself? (laughs) - Not enough time to waste on this silly thing. I mean, even if I believed it, it would take forever to set all those controls. - That's true, but of course, right now, they're preset. There. (dramatic organ music) - Are you saying that this thing will make me look like that? - Yes, that's what it does. - You'd do that for 50 cents? - What would you consider a fair price? - Fair? Shoot, I'd give anything for that body. - Well, then that seems very generous. Go ahead, it'll only take a moment. Afterwards, you need merely ask to be put back the way it was. - You're serious? - Even if I'm not, what do you have to lose? What do you risk, if you really want that? - What do I have to do? I'm not takin' my clothes off. - That's not necessary. Just dip inside. - Are you sure this will work? - You'll see. (whoosh) (beep) (rumbling) - Hey, Grant. Do you wanna see something? Check out this geek. (laughs) - Okay, that's disgusting. (snake hissing) - I betcha if we stay here long enough, he'll bite his head off. That's what happened one time, when I was with Bobby. It was pretty cool. (laughs) (snake hisses) - [Melanie] Are you sure you didn't see her come out? - Yes, I'm sure. I've been standing right here the whole time. - Well, I've been all the way around. There's no other way out, unless you crawled out under the tent. (panting) Are you sure you didn't see her? - Yes, I'm sure! (sighs) - Well, I'll go check it out. Wait here. Hey, maestro, I think one of our friends is still inside. Can I take a quick look -- - We're closed. There's nobody left inside. - Well then, when I look for her, I won't find her. - Maybe you didn't understand me, there's nobody left inside. Now, if you don't mind, we're closed. - Hey! (thud) - Good night. Thank you, Lester. - Okay, we know she wouldn't have just walked off. Just doesn't make any sense. - Hey. - It wouldn't make any sense that she's still in there either. - Hey, look. (dramatic music) (dial tone) - I don't know. - They coming? (laughs) - I don't think they believed a word that I said, but yeah, they're sending out a car. - Look, Jeanie did not leave here on her own. - Hey, I told them that. - Did you tell them about the bear? - Yes, yes, I told them about the bear. Look, they don't seem to place much importance on it. Listen, technically with them, she's considered an adult. If there's no evidence of foul play, they're not going to do anything for 24 hours. (scoffs) - Well, at least when they get here, we'll be able to look inside that tent. - If she's in there, we'll find her. - You the kids that got me out of a good poker game, to come out here, lookin' for a lost friend of yours? - That's right, Sheriff. (sighs) - The last time we saw her, she was goin' outside to look for Bobby. She never made it outside. They closed the show down, they wouldn't let us back in to look for her. - And then we found this in the garbage. - That's just carnival junk. - Look, you don't know my friend. She's not the type to go off with some stranger, and there's no other way home. - And why would she have thrown away the bear? - Well, I'm not a mind reader, kid, but maybe she just got pissed off, or maybe she did something that she didn't want anybody to know about. My point is, there's a first time for everything. I don't know what the hell you expect me to do about it. - What do you know about Dr. Graves? - Excuse me? - Graves, the guy who runs the Horrors of Nature show? (laughs) - All I know is that he's got a permit to run this freak show, or whatever the hell he calls it, and old doc ain't done nothin' wrong yet. I have to give it 24 hours, then if she doesn't turn up, I can tear this sideshow apart. - Yeah, you know, I'm thinkin' something. - Well, that sounds dangerous. What? - If somethin' bad did happen to Jeanie, or if they did somethin' to her, and she doesn't show up in 24 hours -- - Oh, my God. - What're you getting at? - Just that maybe this isn't the first time, is it? - I don't follow you, Sherlock. - He means, the first time a girl comes to the show, and just disappears. - I'm tellin' ya, it ain't any of my business. If you were smart, you wouldn't make it your business either. The law's a tricky damn thing. You kids could end up behind bars. - Look, we're not leaving here without her. - We want to look in that tent. - Well, at least you're loyal. Okay, I'll give it a shot without a search warrant. But, if I get your butts in there, and she's not there, then you're gonna drop it, and that's my final answer. Let's go. (dramatic music) - [Bobby] Sheriff, I'm tellin' you, she did not come through that entrance. - [Sheriff] Yeah, I heard you, kid. - [Melanie] She wouldn't have just left, and we're 20 miles from home. - [Sheriff] You know, you're starting to sound a lot like my ex-wife. She was a broken record. - [Grant] There's somethin' not right about the sideshow. - [Sheriff] That's why they call 'em freaks, kid. I'm just a zookeeper. (knocks on podium) Anybody home? - [Voiceover] Come in! - That was hard. - [Tommy] Come on, Bobby. - Hope we're not interrupting your game. Sorry to bother you. - Somebody got a beef? - Yeah, these kids seemed to have lost a friend of theirs. You mind if we look around? - Do I look like a babysitter? - Hey, look, the least you could've done is let us come in, in the first place. - Hold on. Sheriff, you should know something. This boy here has been giving me trouble all night. Tossin' me around like a beanbag on the midway, and then comes around after closing, with some story about a girl, threatening me. - So I kicked him out on his ass. - She's not my girl, she's a friend of Melanie's. - And she came in here, and she never came out. - That's right. I was outside the whole time. - What about that, doc? - How about what? You think I'm hiding her somewhere? - This is nuts. - Take a look! - It was bigger before. I mean, it seemed bigger. - This is the whole place. You want to search? Go right ahead. - [Grant] I don't get it. - Yeah. Well, unless there's something else I can do for you. - Let's get out of here. - You little mistakes of nature better pray that I don't have to come back here, and make you part of my sideshow. - [Bobby] Come on. - Now, hold on, hold on. Don't want you guys goin' away with bad feelings. Everyone makes mistakes. Here. - What's this? - Backstage passes. Guaranteed free admission to Horrors of Nature. One time only, day or night. - Thanks for nothing. - Hey, take 'em. You might need 'em someday. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, well we'll be back. Don't you worry. - Hope you find your friend. (ominous music) I guess that's show business. - In less than 24 hours, it's gonna be my business. - I wonder where that poor girl could be. (bubbles) (tense organ music) - You'd really do it, wouldn't you? - What? - Would you just blow this whole thing off, go home, leave Jeanie in, God knows where? Christ, man, she was your date! - Man, I never asked you to do anything, okay? Since when did you care about Jeanie, or anybody else, for that matter? - Oh, yeah, go ahead, Bobby. Go ahead, open your frickin' mouth up to me. I'll give you something to be scared of. (scoffs) You want to hear my rule? I mess with people, they don't mess with me, so maybe, just maybe, I don't like havin' some sideshow dwarf mess with me? Kind of smile while he does it? Just maybe, that's the whole reason that I don't want to turn around and say, "Screw it." At least I want to do somethin'. - Listen, Bobby, tomorrow that sideshow's gonna be gone. If there's any chance of finding her or finding any evidence of what they did to her. I mean, hell, if they did something to her, then the place to look for it, is in that sideshow. - There's nothing in there. He -- - I know what they showed us, and I don't care. The inside was bigger before. - Come on! - It was, you know? I know it doesn't make any sense, but you could walk from one side of that tent to the other in 10 seconds. We were walking around in there for a half an hour, and I don't think we were going around in circles. - You're not goin' back, Grant, alright? That's it. - What's the matter? Are you worried about me? Shoot, I'm the last one you should be worried about. By the time I'm your age, I probably won't be able to lift my arms. By the time I'm 20, I'm gonna be dead, if I'm lucky. What? Did I say something embarrassing? I don't care, Bobby. Don't you get it? There's nothing to protect, there's nothing to save. Anybody have a chance, I'll take it! - You comin' with us? - Yes, I'll come. - We're not goin', alright? - Yeah, who exactly are you speaking for? - Why do you always have to act like you're in charge? (clanking) Right, and what are you going to do with that? - This is to see what I'm hitting, and this is to hit what I'm seein'. You comin'? Jesus. Mel, push the kid? We'll head up back that dirt road in the back, then won't see us maybe. - Bobby... You know, I feel sorry for you. - You know, you're crazy to go back there! I'm not scared! (dog barking) - It's just over here. (suspenseful music) Okay. Let's move up, nice and quiet-like. - What do you see? - Nothing. Okay, look. Grant, I want you to stay outside on lookout. - Hey, forget about it! It was my idea! - Keep your voice down! I don't care who's idea it was. If there's gonna be trouble in there, I don't want to be dealing with some kid in a wheelchair. You stay. You hear anybody, you see anything, you holler real loud. - That isn't fair. - Okay, it isn't fair. Come on. Man, sometimes I think that everybody in the world is psycho, except me. - Why leave yourself out? - It's bigger again. - Shh. (creaking) - Listen. Okay, this is weird. - Oh, come on. It's just a wax dummy. - Don't touch her! - Why? Does she got a problem, too? - What? - Nothing, it just... It feels warm, you know? (laughs) I mean, it can't be. Jesus Christ. - Look! The tattoo! - [Tommy] What? - It's Jeanie's tattoo! - Go! Out. Mel! Mel! - Tommy? Tommy! Where are you? - Melanie? (gasps) (suspenseful percussive music) - Please don't touch me! I'm sorry! Please don't touch me! Please, please. (screams) - You make one sound, and I will use this on you. Where's Dr. Graves? - I'm sorry, I don't know. - Stand up. Now you answer me. Where's Mel? What have you done to Jeanie? - I don't know. - I'm telling you, don't you fuck with me. - So you say. - I'm the one who fucks with people. They don't fuck with me. - Are you going to? - Am I going to what? - Fuck with me? - Where are your freak buddies? - Look at my eyes. (screaming) - I should explain something to you. I like to think of my little establishment as a, kind of, court of justice. What happens here, in the end, is justice. You needn't worry about Jeanie. She got her perfect body she always wanted. She wanted it for anything, and now she has it. She has no head to worry about anything, anymore. And you, young lady, what do you dream of? Eternal youth? Eternal beauty? Eternally the desire of all men, but forever untouched. So be it. (screaming) (beeping) (dramatic music) - [Tommy] What the hell am I doing? - Showing me what kind of man you are. You know, you should feel honored. You're my first. (laughs) - [Tommy] Oh, yeah, baby. I believe you, I believe you. - I don't mean the first one to make love to me. I mean, the first one to do this. (crunching) (muffled groans) - Oh, am I interrupting something? - I'm doing it, Dr. Graves! I'm doing it! - Yes, I see. You've always wanted men to see what you're like on the inside. It seems like he's getting a good look. (crunching) (yelling) Well, young man, look at you. Look what nature's given you. Youth, strength, agility, and look what you've done with them. You've wasted them. Now, you'll get the body you do deserve. A body born to keeping of your twisted soul. (laughs) (crunching) (thud) (dramatic music) (grunts) (thud) (whistling) (upbeat suspenseful music) - Grant! Grant, are you okay? (grunts) What happened? - The chair, my chair's broke. - Where the hell are Tommy and Mel? - I don't know. - I told you not to go back there. I told you it was crazy! Let me sit you up. - No, don't grab me. I think I might've broke a rib. - Damn! The van, the van's not far, okay? I'm gonna go get it, you just sit right here. It's not far, it's not far. You just sit tight, okay? It's almost morning. Alright, you'll be okay. (panting) (birds chirping) - Please don't hurt me. - We won't, I promise you. Lester, sit the man up please. - What do you want from me? (grunting) (yells) What in the world are you? - What am I? Why, I'm not very different than most men. Part devil, part angel. Some find Hell in me, others Heaven. But in either case, it's Heaven or Hell of their making, not mine. I simply take what's on the inside, and put it on the outside. Your three friends have already enjoyed the benefits of our readjustments. So, the only question that needs answering now, young man, is what's inside you? What do you need? What's your Heaven? I already know what your Hell is. A young, strong spirit, trapped in a body dying by inches. Dragging down the soul while it dies, and there's nothing for you to do, but to simply surrender to a terrible fate. Ah, your ticket. Hmm, it's yours. One time only. The others came into my realm, so they had no choice but to, accept the justice of Abbot Graves. - But I have a choice? - You have a chance. Stay here, and wait for your brother, and you'll know what will happen. But if you use that pass... Well, that's your chance. (dramatic music) - Wait. - Grant! Grant! Grant, can you hear me? I told you not to go back there. I'm scared. Christ, I'm scared. (bird cawing) - You again. - Show is closed. We're moving to Greenfield, sorry. - I -- - Did you hear what the man said? Scram, before you get into big trouble. - No. - Now, look -- - [Bobby] I don't have to go. - Oh? - I have a pass, a backstage pass. You said it was good any time. - Maybe you should think about it, boy. After all, that pass is good for a lifetime. Once you use it, it's gone forever. One time only, understand? Once I punch that ticket, you can't take it back. - I'm up for it. - Maybe you think you are. You know, we've been working on some new exhibits, things we haven't even shown the public yet, things that take a strong stomach. Do you have a strong stomach, boy? Do you really want to do this? - No, I don't. - [Dr. Graves] Hmm. (clicks) - Hey, kid, what're you waiting for? It's a backstage pass, not a guided tour. You want a look? Go look. I'd tell you to kiss my ass, if I had one. - That's enough. (bird cawing) (dramatic music) - Jeanie? It can't be! - A perfect body, it's what she wanted. It was what she was ready to give up anything to get, and now she has it. Have you had enough? - No. - Well then, go on! - He won't get away with this. I'll come back, I swear. I'll get some help and I'll come back. I'm sorry. - Don't worry about that, boy. Your pass entitles you to see everything. (laughs) (humming) - Melanie? Melanie! - To always be young, always beautiful, always the object of desire, and always untouched, and untouchable. That's what this one dreamed of. (laughs) Now she has it. Hands that reach out with desire, but never touched. (laughs) Never, for all time! Have you seen enough? - No. - Then by all means! - Tommy? (groaning) - Yeah. Help me. - Ooh, that one got what he deserved. - He deserved that? - Everyone deserves to be on the outside, what he is truly on the inside. - What about Grant? What does he deserve? What did you do to him? - If you want the answer to that question, you have to go ahead. There's one more to see yet. (grunting) - Grant? Grant! - No, no, that's not your friend, but she would like to be. You're almost at the end. I just finished the banner. - Bobby! - Grant? Jesus! He deserved this? What sin is he being punished for? - Punished for a dying, wasted boy? Vitality, agility, and a place where no one could look upon him with pity? - You're saying he wanted this? - This is what I need. Don't you see? This was always meant to be my home. (growls) You see, I can walk, I can jump. (growls) - There's still one curtain left. (birds chirping) - So what's it gonna be? That fortune teller never gave me my future. What do I deserve? What do I get? - [Voiceover] Go on through! There's no way back now. (whoosh) - Do you still want your fortune read? - Yes, tell me. What do I get? What is it that I deserve? What do I want? - Aren't you afraid? Do you really want to know what you'll get? - I'm not afraid, whatever it is. - Very well, then. You will get what you have earned. - What? What's that? What have I earned? - To be alone. - Wait! (thud) (dramatic string music) (bells chiming) (heavy metal music) (thunder rolling) (laughs) - Hey! - Uh-oh, there goes my audience. (bubbles) (glops) - So step right up. Step right up. - Damn! (thud) (growls) - Christ, I'm scared.
