This nitrate copy of The Wandering Image, a film by Fritz Lang, was found in Brazil and restored by the Cinemateca de Sao Paulo. I must say I never had the satisfaction of knowing your late cousin, much less his wife, either. Through broad fields. A telegram for Irmgard Vanderheit. Irmgard Vanderheit, The widow of George Vanderheit? "Irmgard Vanderheit, if you think you can escape you are wrong." John Send this telegram for me with the urgent note enclosed and the rest of the money is for you for your efforts. H. Marcus Munich "Suspend temporarly the issue with Irmgard Vanderheit. Greetings" Wil Brand The carriage for Lady Karen Svenden. Oh! I've just given the room that was reserved to this lady to other guests. If Your Excellency will allow, I will put the room that was reserved for me at your disposal. There is still a free room, on the other side of the lake if you want to go there. It's the old monk that is ringing. It is always a bad omen. My name is John Vanderheit. The widow of George Vanderheit - Wife of George Vanderheit? Sir, can't you see that my wife has a mental disorder and I really need to find her, no matter what? Dear Lady, I have no right to meddle in your private affairs, but if you need protection don't hesitate to ask. A monstrous man just asked for your Excellency, so I came to you immediately. Can I help you? Nothing can help me in any way. How can I escape destiny? You need to go immediately, because he is already crossing the lake, and you can only escape through the mountains. I'm forever grateful for your help. Do you think I'm lying? Then look for yourself! I'm looking for the road to escape from the storm. No one can show you a way he does not know. Do you think I'm lying? Then look for yourself and see if you can find anyone inside. The key to this cabinet? I don't know where is it. I lost it, for the love of God. Sir, do you think I hid your wife inside? Do you want to go though this alone? Whoever wants to go on this walk must first meditate for a week. Now you go forward and then turn left to arrive at the stone statue, but be careful because up there they are working in the quarrys For the construction of the new road. Where is my wife!? Wait, you fiend, I'll show you a thing or two! Do you want me to thrash him, Rita? And her alone in this fog, here in the mountains? Holy Mary in the snow Can you help me? Always go to your left. On the right you'll go to the quarry where they are dynamiting rocks now. Shrouded in fog. One more step and I'll throw myself over the edge. We don't have time to reach the village before nightfall. Let us find shelter in the first hut we find, since the weather is threatening. What a strange ringing of bells. There is a very old legend regarding that. The inhabitants of the area say that it's Death that makes the bells ring. Nobody knows where they are. We are trapped by the cave-in! You ... George! Yes... it is I, George! Shadows of the past I was just searching for a house that put an advertisement saying they needed a servant because I need to earn living to take care of my old mother. I placed that advertisement. My search for a wife has brought me countless problems. Would you like to be my assistant? From common work comes common thinking, and one day... I can't destroy all my work like that if you want to be my wife in free love, meaning, by God and my conscience, but not by law. Promise me just one thing: That my mother will never know. The new relatives. First he wants to change the organizations of the world and now suddenly this marriage. And time went by. George, you know that until today I was faithfull to your way of thinking. But now it's not only about me. It's for our son, George. Let me be your wife also in law. Can the woman that loves me demand that I abandon my beliefs? Our son will suffer for your vanity as much as I will. A secret meeting And then a letter. The discovery. But do you want to contradict something I saw with my own eyes? The news about the death. Funeral Notices Missing for a few days is the well known scholar and philosopher George Vanderheit. His coat was found in a boat drifiting in the waves in the lagoon. We can infer he was a victim of a disaster, and most likely drowned. I will not return to the world before you, stone statue, start walking. It was natural landslide - a stone rolled down and trapped us in this cave-in. We must wait for someone to come and rescue us. For now the cabin will hold but if another lanslide comes... I thank God that you are still live and that I can still live so you know the truth. I don't want you to think that I am a crook and that I didn't have the means to support you and the child in the future. You cannot imagine how much I suffered the day your will was read Two years had already passed and your death was already obvious. I leave all my estate to my legitimate wife, Irmgard Vanderheit, n?e Svensen, whom I married in the Church of Saint Nicholas on the 5th of August of the current year. You can find the proof of my marriage in the archives of the Church of Saint Nicholas It was when that I knew about the consequences of my action and I began my ascension to Calvary, but I had your death on my conscience. Do you think I'll continue with this farce? You made me a criminal and now you present yourself as innocent. John, almost daily he forced himself on me, and one day... You think that because one day I was conveniently there I am forced to watch your every step? Luck let me find you and I properly treated you as my sister-in-law... Irmgard is insane. And to escape John's persecution of me, I tried to run away using my family name, so I could rest in peace I took my son to my mother's home. On my way there I got a telegram from John, saying I could not escape his claws. The rest you already know. Won't you forgive me? A second landslide covers them further. I'll see if I can catch that bandit. You go to the cabin. On the way back, with his back turned. Return to the world with me, George, and we will start a new life. I won't return to the world until that stone virgin starts walking, I made this vow and I will fulfill it. I entrust to you a saved soul and I hope you know how to take care of her. Irmgard sent for her mother and son to join her in the mountains. If you weren't the wife of the late George Vanderheit who, in his will, didn't reveal his marriage, all his fortune would have gone to me. So it was my fault that you cease to be the legitimite heir? Can I deny this pleasure to the man, who saved my life? Dear God, what am I to do? Do you have the right not to help a woman in the greatest of her trials? If you are in fact the Holy Mary, as people call you then release me from my vow. The Angel of the Poor A storm at the mountain. Give me this innocent. I will take better care of him than you who have no means. And she came down to the field. Holy Mary in the snow. After the storm THE END
