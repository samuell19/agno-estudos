In 1860, Burckhardt's "The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy" appeared, was published, paying tribute to "L'uomo universalis"... man as superman... ...simultaneously a warrior, philosopher, scientist and artist. Bismarck: The Warrior Darwin Natural Selection Schopenhauer: The World is My Stage Nietzsche: Superman. ..."What crosses he may yet erect..." "What crosses he may"... ..."yet erect." "O Lord"... ..."when night consumes my soul"... - Is Noejd out there? - He's in the kitchen He's in the kitchen again? Fetch him in at once! What's the problem this time? That rascal's been at it with the maid again. Maybe you could have a word in his ear. Would a trooper take any notice of God's word? They certainly don't affect me. And don't I know it. What have you been up to now? I couldn't say in front of the pastor. Don't mind me, lad. Out with it, if you know what's good for you! We were at a dance at Gabriel's and Ludvig said... What has Ludvig got to do with it? Stick to the truth.? Well Emma said that we should go into the barn. - Are you the father's child or not? - How could anyone tell? Were you the only one? I was on that occasion, but there were probably others. This is dreadful. But listen, Noejd... Surely you're man enough to know whether or not you're the father. I admit I did it, but you know that it doesn't always come to anything. The thing is, we're talking about YOU. Are you prepared to leave the girl with the baby? But Ludvig's involved. This will have to be decided in court. Dismissed! Noejd... just a moment! Don't you think it dishonourable to leave a girl like that supporting a child? Yes, If I was sure I was the father, but you ca never tell, Pastor. To slave the rest of your life for someone else's kid is no joke. Surely you gentlemen would appreciate that. Dismissed! And stay out of the kitchen, you rogue! Come, come, come to us, we're waiting... ...now while darkness rushes down... For God to push the door a tad ajar... This, Lord, we your faithful pray. Beautiful songs will be resounding... Why didn't you come down on him? That's what I did. You just mumbled to yourself. I really don't know what to say. What were we talking about when we were interrupted? Yes, it was about Bertha's confirmation. It wasn't about her confirmation... ...but about her upbringing in general... ...desert journey, and into the land of Canaan. Beautiful songs will be resounding... This house is full of women who all want to educate my child. Ma-in-law wants her to become a spiritualist, Laura an artist, and Margaret a Baptist. The maid's a Salvationist. You can't put a soul together with all those pieces. So she has to get out of this place. You've got too may woman running this place. I certainly have! It's like being in a cage full of tigers. Well may you laugh! When I married your sister, I also got your old stepmother. You have to keep your woman organised. ...so that each just gets her share. Laura was treated with a firm hand... ...but I must say of my own sister that she was always a handful. Laura isn't so bad. You can be honest... I know her only too well. After all, she is my wife. All that means is she's the most demanding of you. Laura won't let Bertha leave her... I can't allow her to remain in this mad-house. Mad-house... really? Yes, mad-house. Laura really gets into such a passion sometimes that I'm anxious about her. I'm afraid she's sick in the head. I sometimes think she might burn the house down. All I hear are hints about what a woman can become. It's man and woman against each other all day long. Are you leaving? You can stay for a bit.... You know I'm waiting to greet the new doctor. Have you met him? I caught a glimpse of him as I passed by. He looked a nice trustworthy sort. He might be an ally for me. Can't you stay? No thanks, my wife gets uneasy if I'm late. Uneasy? I guess you mean angry. Let me help you with your coat. You need to watch your health, Adolf. You seem jumpy. - Do I seem nervous? - You don't look well. Did Laura say something? Laura's had me at death's door for the past 20 years. Look after yourself, old chap! Didn't you want to talk about the confirmation? Do whatever you think needs doing. I'm not bothered one way or the other. We've put all that behind us. 'Bye then. Regards to all. 'Bye bro. Say hi to Laura. Say hi to Laura? Say hi to Laura. Say hi to...! 34, 9, 43, 7, 8, 56. - Would you mind... - Just a minute! 66, 77, 84, 89, 100. What is it? Am I interrupting something? No... Itâ€™s about housekeeping money I suppose? Leave the accounts there, and I'll go through them. - Accounts? - Yep! Are we keeping accounts now? Our finances are precarious, and accounts are necessary. Otherwise we can be punished as reckless debtors. If our finances are bad, it's not my fault... ...that our tenant doesn't pay. It was you who recommended the tenant. Why did you recommend someone so unreliable? You accepted him. I wouldn't have got a moment's peace... If I hadn't accepted him, I would have been either in the loony bin or the family plot. Here's your housekeeping. I'll get the accounts later. Thank you so very much. Do you account for what you spend, besides the housekeeping money? Not your concern. That's true. Just as little as my child's education concerns me. Did you gentlemen come to a decision? I'd already come to a decision. Bertha will be boarded in town. Children are raised in the father's beliefs. And the mother has no say in the matter? None at all. She has ceded her rights in return for the man supporting the family. No rights over her child? None. Once you've sold your goods, you can't get them back, yet keep the money. But what if the mother and father come to an agreement? What was Noejd doing here? That's a confidential army matter. That all the servants know about. So you've made your judgement? There's a law about it. The law doesn't tell us who the father is. One usually knows. There are wise people who say that one can never tell these things. - You can't? - No. What if the wife were unfaithful? That's not the case here. Call me as soon as the doctor arrives. Aye aye sir! Straight away. I don't want to appear rude. You understand? I understand. Laura! Laura! Yes?! Isn't my tea ready yet? In a minute! Dr Ostermark. Welcome, Doctor... A very warm welcome. Thank you. Please come inside. My bag. I'm sorry I'm late, but I've already had to make a call. There's a lot of illness in the district at the moment. I hope that you'll find it enjoyable here all the same. We're very happy to have a doctor... ...that we've heard spoken so well of. You're too kind... I hope you shan't require too many visits from me. Your family's in good health? Things are... ...unhappily not as they should be. It's my painful duty... ...to tell you the full story, right away. Couldn't this wait until I've met the Captain? No. You must hear my side, before you meet him. You have me worried. My husband is mentally ill. There... now you know. You'll soon judge for yourself. I must say... I've read your husband's excellent articles on mineralogy... ...and seen a clear and powerful intellect! Really? I'd be delighted if the entire family should prove to be mistaken. Of course, it's possible that his mind is disturbed in other directions.. Tell me about it. But what does he buy? He brings home boxes full of books. Scholars buy books... He never reads them. Don't you believe me? Just look here... We live like exiles in these damp closets of rooms. The house is in chaos. He's furnished for himself in the attic, where our daughter also sleeps. This way, Doctor. Your mail, Ma'am. I'm sorry that it's so primitive here... ...but I thought it best that you saw up close... ...with regard to his condition. Yes, of course. But I still find it hard to believe... Is it reasonable for a man to say he can see activity on another planet through a microscope? - Does he say that? - Yes, he does. In a microscope? Yes, in a microscope. That's very serious, if it's true. You have no faith in what I say, Doctor. Of course I do, but as a doctor I must investigate before deciding. How can I convince you?! Yes? Don't arouse any thoughts that might excite him. They can easily become fixed ideas. You mean... ...to avoid arousing any suspicions? Exactly. One can make an insane person believe anything. Then I understand. I'll just be a minute... My mother has to have her tea. Re the Captain Fixed ideas. Confusion Microscope The Captain asks if you would be so kind as to come upstairs, Doctor No Doctor... you don't need to talk to me... Hurry on up to see him. It's urgent, it is... It's best he sees how he is when he's up there.. If he doesn't go up to see him first he's liable to tear the whole house down. I know how he is, but the doctor's understanding. He seems a nice, kind, tidy sort of man. You stupid fool! No! No! No, I said! But here's the doctor! Doctor, you're most welcome. Forgive the confusion in here. I'm trying to get my books arranged, after all these years. Sorry, I can't hear you. Can you keep it down? Come in here. It's a great pleasure to make the acquaintance of so celebrated a man of science. My army duties don't allow me to make any very profound investigations... ...but I believe I'm close to a real discovery. I've submitted meteorites to spectrum analysis... ...and found carbon. A trace of organic life... How about that?! Can you see it in a microscope? No, goddammit! A spectroscope! Spectroscope... Yes, of course. If only the confounded booksellers in Paris would send me the books! It's a conspiracy! In 2 months I've had no response to orders, letters or telegrams! Driving me crazy. You shouldn't let their sloppiness get to you. My treatise will not be ready in time! But we shouldn't be talking about me, but about you. Would you rather live here in the wing, or in the old quarters? It's all the same to me. That's your decision, Captain. No it's not... Don't you know what you want? Tell me, or you'll make me angry. Well, if it's up to me, I guess I'll stay here. Thank you for that! Nothing irritates me more than when people say "it's all the same to me." Noejd, show the doctor the way. Good day then, Doctor. Do you have to keep on with that sawing? Must you do it in there? It's very disturbing! Can't you at least answer me? See what we have to put up with, Doctor. Re the Captain Regulation Intelligence Spectroscope. Master Adolf... Yes, Margret old girl? You're the only one I can listen to without getting into a rage. There, there, Adolf. Don't you think you should go half-way... ...and come to an agreement with Mistress in this fuss over Bertha? Consider the mother... Consider the father, Margret. The child's surely the one to consider. Well? But I'm so tired. Here... write. Nothing's happening. Because you plan to tattle to daddy. But then the spirits will avenge. He understands nothing of this. Anyway, he has much worse things that can see other planets. Well... isn't there anything? Let me see... show me... "Only after the girl on the moon and the Earth's sons in the thread..." The girl on the moon? Are you making fun of me, you brat?! That's Stagnelius! You watch yourself! I gave the child life... Now I must give her my soul. I still think you could agree. You're no friend of mine. ! How can you say that?! Have you forgotten you were my child when you were little? You were like a mother. Now you've gone over to the enemy... Yes, the enemy! That doctor's no friend either. Twaddle! Humble your proud heart... and you'll see that God will make you happy... ...and love your neighbour. Whenever you speak of God and love... ...your voice becomes hard and your eyes full of hate. You're proud and hard about all your learning... It doesn't do you much good in the end. I know learning means nothing to creatures like you lot! Help me...! Something is about to happen. I don't know what it is. But I know it's not right... ...whatever's to occur. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, help me! Daddy! What is it, sweetheart? I think they're going to hurt me! Who's going to hurt you? What have you done now? You've never told me about this before. Grandma says if I did, the spirits would take revenge. Do you believe there are spirits? - I don't know. - I know they don't exist. But Grandma says there are things that SHE can see... ...but YOU can't see. Well, she's lying. - Grandma can't be lying. - Why not? That means Mummy's lying, too. If you say that Mummy tells lies, I'll never believe you again! I want to talk to Bertha. He's harming her. Has the mail come? For your own sake, you're going to have to leave home. Would you like that? Would I ever! So long as I saw you sometimes. Often. My sweetheart...! But, Daddy... You have to be nice to Mummy... She cries so much. But if you want to and I want to, but she doesn't want to... What can we do then? Then everything will be in a muddle again. Why can't you... Perhaps we could ask Bertha's opinion concerning her own future. No! Nobody can intrude upon my rights. Women or children. Bertha... leave now. Well? So when is Bertha to leave? In a fortnight. So I'll have to try and prevent it. - You can't. - Can't I just!? Should a mother let her child loose amongst evil people... ...who tell her everything her mother taught her was stupid. Would a mother want to be despised by her daughter for the rest of her life? Should a father allow ignorant women to tell his daughter that he is a charlatan? It doesn't matter as the mother is closer to the child. Besides nobody can ever be sure who a child's father is. What do you mean? You don't know if you're Bertha's father. - I don't know? - No. Ae you joking? No. I'm making use of your own teaching. How do you know I haven't been unfaithful? I believe a lot of things, but ot that. Suppose I was prepared to do anything at all... ...in order to keep my child. That I'd say that Bertha was mine but not your child. Just suppose! Then your authority over her would vanish. Once you'd proven I wasn't the father. Would you like me to? I'd only need to give the name of the real father... ...the place... the time... Stop it...! or... Or what? That's enough for now. But be careful... And above all don't make a fool of yourself. I consider all this most lamentable. So why do you provoke a contest... ...with a superior foe?! - Superior? - Yes. I've never met a man I didn't feel superior to. Well, you've met your match now, and you'll never forget it! That'll be interesting... Can't wait to see it! Come on... show me!. Supper's ready. Aren't you coming to supper? No, I don't want anything. Are you feeling glum? No, just not hungry. Come along... Otherwise there'll be awkward questions. Pretty please! Well, stay there! Bertha! You believe I'm Bertha's father don't you? Don't be childish. Of course you're her father. Come and eat... Don't sit here sulking. Come along now. The devil take these witches! Svard! Captain? Put horses to my sleigh, right away! Here you are, Doctor. Master Adolf, listen, please... Get out, woman! Don't expect me home before midnight! Noejd! Noejd! Have you followed my order? Where's my cane? My cane. Jesus, help us! What will be the end of this? I never said that. I made a note of it. You said "microscope". One must be scrupulous when a certificate of insanity is in question. - Certificate of insanity? - Yes. You realise that a certified person loses all family rights. No. I didn't know. He said his correspondence with his booksellers has been unanswered. Have you been intercepting it? Certainly. It would have ruined us. Midnight... He's still not home. Dear Lord... Where do you think he might be? No idea. He has such crazy whims nowadays. Perhaps I should wait up for his return. I could cover it by saying I came to see your mother who was unwell. Thank you. Alright, I'll make sure that works out fine. Six years ago, he acknowledged... ...in a letter to the doctor... ...that he feared for his sanity. "Life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." "The angel of death, hovering over the world, cries out..." "Vanity!" "Corruption!" I don't dare sit alone up there. I feel it's haunted. "What is all that makes up life... Misery, torment, endless strife." May God grant us a merry Christmas. Margret... Is it true that Daddy's sick? Yes, it seems he is. So we won't celebrate Christmas? But how can he be sick and not be in bed? It's like this, my child... He has a sort of sickness that lets him stay up. There's the sleigh! Hurry off to bed and take the tray, otherwise he'll be cross. Quick... off to bed! So! Are you still up?! Go to bed! The old mistress is ill. The doctor's here. Anything serious? No, just a cold I think. Who was the father of your child, Margret? I've told you before.... It was that rogue Johansson. Are you sure it was him? Absolutely... He was the only one. Was HE sure he was the only one? He could never be. But YOU can be sure. Do you think Bertha's like me? Like two peas in a pod. Good evening, Doctor. How is mother-in-law? Just a slight sprain in her left foot. Margret told me it was a cold. Go to bed, Margret. Please take a seat, Doctor. Thanks. Is it true that you obtain striped foals if you cross a zebra and a mare? Perfectly true. Is it true that the foals continue to be striped if the breed is continued with a stallion? Yes, that's true, too. So that shows that the paternity can't be proven. As Goethe says, a man accepts paternity in good faith. In good faith... ...when a woman's involved? That is risky. There are so many kinds of women. Recent investigations have found that there is only one kind! When I was young, I was strong, arrogant and good-looking. There was this occasion I was travelling on a steamer. A group of us companions sat in the dining salon. The young stewardess flung herself down beside me, in tears. She told me that her fiance had drowned. We sympathised with her... ...and I ordered champagne. Women can be oblivious to the villainy of their actions. That's where the risk lies. Captain, your thoughts are taking an unsound direction. You have to control them. You shouldn't say "unsound", when the whole world is unsound. All steam-boilers explode when the pressure gauge reaches 100. But the scale is not the same for all boilers... understand? In the meantime... You are here to keep watch on me. If I were not a man... ...I should have the right to accuse, or "complain" as it's politely termed. Perhaps I could give you a complete diagnosis... ..and even perhaps offer you... ...the entire history of the illness. But I am unfortunately a man... And all I can do is cross my arms like the Romans... ...and hold my breath until I die. Good night. Captain, if you are ill, it will not offend your dignity as a man to tell me everything. I do need to hear the other side of the story. Good night, Doctor. You see I am calm. You can go to bed with confidence. Good night. I cannot take part in this business any longer. Are we enemies? No, far from it. But it's a shame that we can't be friends. Goodnight. Come on in... I heard you listening there. Sit down. I've been to the post office this evening, and collected some mail. It appears that you have intercepted both my outgoing and incoming mail. And I have intercepted mail to you. How noble of you. It appears that you have caused irreparable damage to my work. You have also spread rumours as to my state of mind. The fact of the matter is this... My intellect is intact... ...as you well know. But you've worked away at it, and the cogs begin to slip... ...and the mechanism will collapse. This is the approaching mania. You surrender, then? No. I'm proposing peace. On what conditions? That I keep my sanity. Deliver me from my suspicions... ...and I'll burn these. What suspicions? About Bertha's birth. Maybe you really wish that you were deceived? Strangely enough. Laura... save me my sanity! Must you have power over the child? The power, yes. What has our fight been about, other than power? You know I don't believe in a future life, so the child was my key to immortality. If you take that away, my life is cut short. Why have we never separated? Who is the father? You. No! It's not me. There is a buried crime here. And what a hellish crime! I've worked and slaved for you... ...sacrificed promotion and career... I've endured torture, sleeplessness, worry for your sake... ...because I believed that I was the child's father! - Now you're quite mad. - That's what you hope! I've seen how you worked to conceal your sin. I've heard you cry in your sleep, without letting myself listen. Now I remember... No, go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! What's wrong? You were screaming. What's the time? 3 o'clock. I was reading in the drawing room. You sounded awful. What were you dreaming? Well? Leave me alone. I shall swear before God... ...that you are Bertha's father. How does that help me? You said that a mother may commit any crime at all for her child. Listen... Can't you see that I'm as helpless as a child? I only ask for compassion. I'm begging you for mercy. What's this? Are you crying... A man?! Yes I'm crying, though I'm a man. Does a man not have eyes... ...hands, senses, thoughts, passions? Are we not fed the same food, hurt with the same weapons as a woman? Warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a woman. If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? Why shouldn't a man get to complain... ...a soldier weep? Because it's unmanly? Why is it unmanly? There, there... Cry my child... You have your mother back. Poor wee thing... there... there... I'll take you! I'll take you! You can't manage that... Let me help you... Get it off, damn it!! Now... Get off me! Get away! Go away! What's wrong? I feel ashamed. Do you think I'm unmanly? The mother as mistress... You aren't my friend. Friend? The mother was your friend. But the woman was your enemy. I became a soldier because I saw your contempt. I wanted to achieve something... ...or commit an honourable suicide. I didn't get to go to war... No you didn't. So I threw myself into science. When I reached out my hand to accept the fruits of my labour... ...you chopped it off. A man can not live without honour. Don't you hear me begging for the coup de grace? No... Now I'm sleepy. If you have any more fantasies, keep them till the morning. Do you hate me? Sometimes... When you're a man. Like a racial hatred. If we are descended from apes, it must be from two different types. We're quite dissimilar. One of us has to be the loser. Which one? The weakest, of course. And of course, you're the strongest. Yes. Tomorrow I shall have you legally certified... ...then I'll be able to raise my child myself. - Certified? - That's right. A certified copy of this letter is with the Commissioner in Lunacy. What letter? Yours. Your declaration to your doctor that you are insane. Your functions in thus family are finished with... ...as an unfortunately necessary father and breadwinner. You're no longer needed. You can go! Help! Fire! Fire! Wake up! Captain! Have you removed all the cartridges from the rifles and boxes? Done. Dismissed! Did you ask for the keys? No... I took them out of his pockets, when I brushed his clothes The doctor has sent for a straightjacket. I'm now trying to sort out the household affairs that he's made such a mess of. What have you got there? Good heavens, it's your old doll. And Bertha's rattle. Your letters. Let me see... The locket! He must have really felt for you. I would never have kept such things. Times changes many things. What's this document? "Grave Title." Better your grave than the asylum. Laura, are you blameless in all this? Just what are you insinuating? You can't deny you want to raise your child yourself. I don't understand what you're on about. How I admire you. Me? You are strong... Incredibly strong. Like a master thief... No accomplice... Not even your own conscience. Look at yourself in the mirror. You don't dare. - I never use a mirror. - You're too scared to. Let me see your hand. Not a trace of insidious poison. An innocent little murder... ...beyond the reach of the law... ..an unconscious sinful act. The unconscious act... Such a delightful discovery. If that man ever gets free... ...he'll cut you up with his saw. You talk a lot... like someone with a bad conscience. Accuse me if you can. That I can't. Therefore I'm innocent. Quiet! It's the doctor. Come with me. You'll slip the jacket onto the Captain, from behind. It's to prevent any outbursts of violence. You see it has excessively long sleeves... ...so as to restrict his movements. The arms are tied at the back... ...with two straps that are buckled. You can hear him up there. Are you convinced now? That an act of violence has occurred, yes. The question is, was it madness or just anger? You agree he had "fixed ideas"? You have ideas that are far more fixed, Pastor. - My religious convictions?! - Let's get off the subject. Now, Madam... It becomes your decision as to whether your husband goes to prison or the asylum. What do you think, Pastor? There'll be a scandal either way. So it's hard to say. What if he's only fined for violence. He could be violent again. And a jail sentence would see him out pretty quickly. So you think it more advantageous that he be treated as insane. - Where's your old nurse? - Why? She's to put the straightjacket on. Have her come in. Listen to me now... As I told you, you have to slip this jacket onto the Captain. Secure it to the back of the chair or couch. Are you ready to do it? No... no Doctor... I can't do it. I can't. Why don't you do it yourself, Doctor? The patient mistrusts me. You're the closest to him... But then he mistrusts you too. Pastor? No, I must decline. Noejd? I'd do what I can to help the Captain. So take the jacket... No, he shan't do that! Noejd isn't going to do him an injury. I'd rather do it... as gently as I can. Noejd can help me if it becomes necessary. That he can do. I've found it! I've found it!! I've got it here! It's all to be read here, all of it... On every line...! I have it all here... All of it! Get out of sight! Your shawl! Hurry up... Get out of sight! Out! The whole situation can be found in this book. I wasn't crazy after all. Here it is in The Odyssey, first canto. Telemachos is speaking to Athene. "My mother indeed maintains that Odysseus is my father..." ..."but I myself know it not, and no man yet truly knows is origin." And this suspicion is harboured by Telemachos about Penelope... ...the most virtuous of women. Isn't that beautiful?! Whereabouts is my Bible? I should have it somewhere here.. Here it is. This is what it says in the Bible... This is what it says in the Bible... Here it is... the prophet Ezekiel. "The Fool saith... Here is my father" "But who can tell whose loins have engendered him." It is quite clear. You're here, Jonas? And the doctor, too? Did I ever tell you about the English lady... ...who complained about an Irishman... ...who'd throw a burning lamp at his wife's face. "God, such women!", I said. "Women?!" she asked. "Yes", I said "When it goes so far..." ..."that a man who has loved a woman..." "...would come to throwing a lamp at her face..." ..."then you know." What do you know? Nothing. Nothing. Nobody knows anything. They only believe. They believe... ...and they're blessed. Yes, blessed. I know that you can be lost by your faith. That I know.. - Captain... - Quiet! I don't want to talk to you. I won't listen to you 'telephoning' their chatter from in there. Jonas... ...do you believe you're father to your children? You used to have a handsome tutor in the house... ...that people gossiped about. Adolf, you watch yourself! Upon my soul... I do believe he's gone pale! We're nothing but ridiculous dupes, we married men. How was it with YOUR marriage bed? Didn't you have a lieutenant boarding with you? Let me see, his name was... He's gone pale, too!. Don't be unhappy... She's dead and buried. What's done can't be undone. Do you realise you're mentally ill? I'm quite aware, yes. If I'd time to work on YOUR illustrious brains, I could have you locked up, too. Yes, I'm crazy. But how did I get that way? That doesn't concern you. It doesn't concern anyone. Let's talk about something else. Jesus Christ...! There's my child. Mine. But we can never know. Bertha! Bertha. - Adolf, stop...! - Bertha! Bertha! Bertha... What can help me now that you've taken my idea of immortality from me? What good is science and philosophy if I have nothing to live for.? I grafted my right arm... ...and half my brain, and they came with knives... ...and cut away the graft. Now I want to die. Do what you like with me. I no longer exist. Are you sick, Daddy? Me? Do you know what you've done? Do you? You threw a lamp at Mummy. Did I? What if you'd hurt her. What would that have mattered? You're not my father, if you can say such things! What are you saying? I'm not your father? Who's your father? Who is it? It's certainly not you! Is it still not me?? That I should live to hear my only child say to my face... ...that I'm not her father. You disgrace your mother when you say that. Say nothing bad about Mummy, do you hear?! The whole lot of you have been against me... The whole time! All of you. Daddy... Never speak that word again. Daddy... Daddy! Bertha! My darling girl! The rest were only morbid thoughts blown in by the wind... ...like plague and fever. Let me see my soul in your eyes... I see her soul, too. Your thoughts must be mine. Your will must be mine! I just want to be myself! You can't do that... because I'm a cannibal! I'll eat you! Your mother wants to eat you, but she won't be able to. Eat or be eaten... That's the question. If I don't eat you, then you eat me. You've already shown your teeth. Don't be scared. Don't be frightened, my darling child. I shan't harm you. No! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Did you take the cartridges out? Yes, I just tidied them away.. Come and sit down quietly, Master Adolf, and I'll get them out for you. Come and sit down and have a little chat with old Margret. Let's see now... Come here Master Adolf. Master Adolf... Do you remember when you were my darling little boy? I used to tuck you into bed... ...and read "Gentle Jesus" to you. Do you remember that? I'd light a candle and tell you about pretty things... ...when you had bad dreams and couldn't sleep. Remember? Keep talking, Margret. It soothes my brain so. Keep talking. Remember when you took the big kitchen knife to carve boats with? I had to trick you to get the knife from you. "Give me that snake," I said... "Or else it will bite you." And then I took your little vest... ...and held it up in front of you... And then I said... "In with your arms..." In they go! Then I'd say... "Sit nice and still..." "...so I can button up at the back." Then I'd say... Up you get now... "...and walk around..." ..."so I can make sure it's on properly." Then I'd say... "Now you must be off to bed." What? Did I have to go to bed after I was dressed? You woman of Satan! Who'd believe you could be so cunning? Forgive me! Forgive me! Trapped... outwitted... ...and unable to kill myself! Forgive me, Master Adolf... ...but I had to stop you from killing the child. Why...? Life is a hell, death is a heaven. And children belong in heaven. What would YOU know about what comes after death? Humble your hard heart and cry to God for mercy. The Saviour said... "Today shallt thou be with me in paradise." Are you croaking for a corpse already, you old crow! - Noejd! "Turn to God, o sinner!" Throw this woman out! She's choking me with her psalm book! Throw her out the window, up the chimney... anywhere! "And the earth shook beneath him." God help you Captain, I can't! If it were 6 men, alright... but a woman is different. Why are they different? Have they not laid hands on me? Look at me. Do you think I'm your enemy? Yes, I do. You're all my enemies. Including my mother, who never wanted me... My daughter, when she had to choose between us. And you are my arch enemy because you waited till I was lifeless before leaving me. I don't know whether I ever planned the way things have turned out for me. Maybe I did, without realising quite what I was doing. All my actions have proceeded along the lines that you laid down. Who's in the wrong? What happened to the love... Where did that healthy physical love get to? It died as a result. Your suspicions about the child are totally without foundation. That's what is appalling... I feel I'm fighting with shadows! My thoughts dissolve into thin air. My brain empties, till it catches fire! I'm cold... Throw something over me... I'm so cold... I'm cold. Raw strength has given way to insidious weakness. Get away, you fiend of a woman, and damnation on your sex! Margret, get the shawl and sit here so I can rest my head on your knee. Get the shawl and come here. Sit down there... Then I can rest my head on your knee. That's so nice. Bend over me so i can feel your breast. How lovely! That is so lovely! And so warm. I feel your soft shawl touching my mouth, Laura. It's so soft and smooth... ...like your arm. It smells of vanilla... ...like your hair... ...when you were young. "God who loves his children dear..." "God who loves his children dear..." ...looks after me when I here." He's praying to God. No... to you... ...My beloved girl... ...that you'll put me to sleep. Good night... ...my beloved little...Bertha. May you... ...be blessed. Bertha! First death, and then the judgement. No judgement. No accusations. You who believe God guides the fortunes of men, should talk to Him about it. My little Adolf... Nobody can be judge in this matter. Just as I can't judge the cause of his illness. Is that all you have to say on his deathbed? Yes, that's everything. I know no more. Those who know more can speak. Mummy? Mummy! My child... My very own child. Amen.
