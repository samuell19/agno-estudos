[MUSIC PLAYING] MAN (VOICEOVER): C.I.P. The following program does not express the views of WSTL 18 or its staff. [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Los Angeles, California, nestled in its rolling hills are countless multimillion dollar homes, glamorous shopping districts, and the most beautiful people on earth. Most LA natives enjoy this incomparable prosperity without regard for those less fortunate. But this month, Community Interest Programming caught up with two Angelenos who realize that with great privilege comes great responsibility and want to give something back. Well, James and I were married about a year ago. And since then, we've been very blessed. James makes a lot of money, so we're very well taken care of financially. We're happy, but I think we felt like something was missing. JAMES: I think for me that thing that was missing was my beautiful Jenna. I think Jenna's always been a very charitable person. She's done a lot of volunteer work. She has a very big heart. That's one of the things I really love about her. And when we got married I thought, now that we're getting married, maybe this is something we could do together as a team to help make the world a better place. So we decided that we wanted to start a charity. We just didn't know for who. And we actually-- I mean this sounds silly, but we actually made a list of all the different charitable organizations that we might deal with. It was a very, very sad list. There's the cancer people, and diabetes, which is a horrible disease, and the Heart Foundation-- JENNA: AIDS babies. JAMES: --AIDS babies, crack babies, the NAACP-- JENNA: Gay men. JAMES: Right, them. There's the kids with the-- what do you call-- the-- you know what I'm-- the rabbit lipped kids. Cleft palates. The kids with the cleft palates. There's an organization out there actually dedicated to sewing their lips back together so that they can live a normal life. And there's also the conjoined twins, which are like-- those are Siamese twins. And I remember when I was a kid, I thought that it would be really awesome to have a conjoined twin, because you'd always have a playmate, somebody to hang out with no matter what. You'd never be lonely. But the reality is much more grim than that. It gets old very quickly, and it's hard to maneuver through, like, a restaurant, or whatever. You knock over stuff a lot. JENNA: So finally, we came to a group that really touched very deeply. JAMES: And that was-- That was the homeless. The homeless-- the homeless. NARRATOR: Since the Great Depression, America has been plagued by the plight of the homeless. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal started a long line of well-intended, expensive government and charitable programs aimed at giving the homeless American a pull up by his bootstraps, but none of these has been enough to truly and permanently change the lives of the homeless. James and Jenna Gunn had a groundbreaking answer. [MUSIC PLAYING] --Each week, we provide homeless individuals with a lollipop. But they're not just any lollipop, which would be great. Our lollipops feature uplifting slogans on the wrapper, and each wrapper features some of James's original artwork. Yeah, um, I think that with God's help I'm able to create very powerful artworks that will help to make a real change in the homeless community. That a homeless person might see one of my artworks, and it might change their worthless life into a life that has meaning-- transformation-- that the lollipops of Lollilove may propel homeless people into going out and to doing something good with their lives, feeling good about themselves, perhaps getting a job, maybe using birth control, all these types of things-- I think-- you know what? I'll share something with you. When I was five years old, I had a defining moment in my life. It was the first time I saw my own artwork. And I was blown away. NARRATOR: Armed with only their good intentions, how does a young and attractive married couple in Los Angeles actually start an effective charity? The first thing that we need to do is to find a corporate sponsor. A corporate sponsor brings a level of prestige. You want to get another company involved in you, so that everyone out there knows that you're a big shot. Shay, how are you? I mean, for example, what sounds better? Hey! Lollilove, or Nike a proud sponsor of Lollilove? Oh, good, well I-- yes, I'm working with a new group. It's a brand new charity completely different than anything I've ever done before. It's called Lollilove. I think that what we're going to find is when I get on the phones, something magical is going to happen. I think that people are going to respond to me. They're going to respond to Lollilove. I think that there's something about our organization that is irresistible. NARRATOR: Through James's business connections, as well as through various churches, country clubs, and alumni groups, Jenna and James built an impressive list of potential sponsors. Jim Masterson, hi, Jenna Gunn, calling from Lollilove. Mr. Martin. Scott, hi. You don't know me. My name is Jenna Gunn, and I'm a non-profit organization called Lollilove. Scott, let me ask you a question. Do you walk down the street each day stepping over hobos on your way to work? Each of the lollipops will feature some of my husband's artwork. Yeah, we work with the homeless. Well, that's where our group comes into play. --respectfully request a donation from your company to help us further our work in the homeless community. Hi, Emily, I think we got disconnected. [DIAL TONE] Hello? Yeah, could I speak to someone in your human resources department? Hello, is this Mission Building Corporation. Hello, may I please speak with your mom or dad? Um, um, por favor-- [DIAL TONE] --speak to-- I was just curious how come you hadn't called back. Mr. O'Reilly? I can make that promise. Let me tell you how. Each week we pledge to provide 100 homeless individuals with a lollipop. A lollipop. A lollipop. That's right-- a lollipop. A lollipop. No, this isn't a joke. A lollipop. Excuse me? Why don't you go [BLEEP] yourself, [BLEEP] --sucker? [CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] JAMES: So Jenna got denied sponsorship by another lollipop company today. They told her that she was disgusting, and the idea for Lollilove was demeaning. And I think that that's a good sign, myself. She's a little bit bummed out about it, but, you know, all great ideas face a lot of adversity. So when people start calling you disgusting or putrid or demeaning, you know that you're onto something really terrific. I mean, that's just the way the world works. And I mean, Stephen King-- how many people-- he turned in his novels to how many places that called him a sick son of a bitch? And now he's the world's biggest-selling novelist. You know what I mean? So I don't know. Somebody called Jenna a [BLEEP] last weekend. And she was about to cry. But man, I'm like, hey, you know, that's good. That's awesome. I certainly think that's a good sign. That's a great sign. I see myself as, like, the Martha Stewart of charity events planning. I want to take it up a notch, you know? I don't want to start a charity just because something bad happened to me. Oh no, I got breast cancer. Oh no, my kid was kidnapped. Let me start a TV show. It's not about me. It's about the people. It's about the people who are suffering. And if there's a way that I can get attention for myself and Lollilove, that's what I'm about I don't know if you know this about me, but I used to be a model. That industry was so selfish that I had to get out of it. That is why today I want to be famous for being a charity events planner. Oh god. Personally, I don't think-- I don't think I get a lot out of doing my artwork. I mean, personally, you know, it like saps me of my life, myself, my being. It's like-- it's like I take something out of myself, and I put it into the art, you know? And then it's gone from me, you know? And I guess it does something for someone else, but it just saps me of my energy and makes me weaker. So it's hard. It's a hard, hard process. It's just like pushing at me, man, all the time. And I really can't think of much else but Jesus Christ. He gave himself. And that's what I do with my art. The only difference is is that Jesus is a totally made up guy, and I'm completely real. I really am feeling this. You read his words in the book. This is me. This is real. And I like to, uh, look at the canvas and ask it what it needs. I don't like to-- it doesn't-- I don't think something. It's like I ask the canvas, what do you need? And I try to, like, you know-- I just try to feel it. Feel it, and I try to, like, pull it up. You know what I mean? [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] What am I feeling? It's like I see colors. I see a little yellow over here. That's right-- a little yellow bird singing, singing the song right down here. I like to pull it up. Pull up some-- co-- what's? I see a line of blue. Pull it up out of there, feel it come up through me-- through me. Do you know who I am? Do you know who you're talking to? I am an artist. I am a creator. Pull it up. Come on-- blue, blue, blue. Sorry, but people are being really mean to me. I'm not having any luck with anything. I can't get anyone-- Honey, honey, honey, how many times have I told you this is my private creative area? This is for me, alone. And I've told you a million times not to be coming out here while I'm doing this, all right? How are you-- you're really-- -I'm sorry. - --going to ruin it. -No, you're right. -That's one homeless-- -I'm sorry. --person you just killed. I'm sorry. So um, Jenna is my very best friend. And we met in boarding school. And we just-- we love to do this volunteer thing. JENNA: Oh no, we're just sitting here in the park. We're doing the flyers today. I'm with Sarah. Say hi to Sarah. Hi. Hey! We came to the park today to just stay in the public eye, maybe find a corporate sponsor. SARAH: Lollilove, JENNA: Lollilove-- help us help the homeless. BOTH: Lollilove! Making a difference! Come take a flyer! Lollilove. Lollilove. Lollilove-- help us help the homeless. Hi! Make a difference! Lollilove. Lollilove. Lollilove. Oh, hey, are you and Peter coming to that benefit at the Ritz this weekend? Oh, yeah, definitely. Oh good. Are you guys going to go? I think so. We go every year. Hey, pretty ladies. Hey, honey. I'm going to go get a frappuccino. You guys want anything? SARAH: Oh, I would love a Diet Coke. JAMES: Diet Coke, OK. Same for me. Running out of Kleenexes. Hey, listen, we're going to that benefit at the Ritz this weekend, right? Baby, I don't want to go with those people. They are so out of touch with reality. Can you put the rest of this stuff back for me? Yeah, I got it. Thanks. JENNA: It's true. Doing charity work, you can get something out of it personally, and that is an attractive thing. Like for me, I have to confront my feelings about our wealth. Like, when I see a homeless person, I want to run away. I don't want to look at that, and that's because I don't want to have to think about how very wealthy we are. With James, I mean like James has his thing with germs. And if we're going to do this, we're going to have to confront that. I mean, if we do it, you're going to have to confront that. Well, no, no, I mean, I agree with you. I see a homeless person, and I want to run away. But the germ thing-- that's not-- I don't think that's exactly something that I need to confront, because there's a way around it, like, by wearing gloves. So, man, this is like-- I got a-- I went to the mall today, and I touched the escalator rail by accident. Normally, I stand right in the middle and try to avoid it, but I touched it with this hand. And I got it all over me. It's an awareness. I have an awareness of germs other people don't have. But it's a blessing. It's a-- I have a second sight when it comes to germs, which protects me. I'll probably live to be a very old man because I don't touch dirty things. It's just Jenna thinks I'm a little bit-- I don't know. She doesn't like the fact that I wash my hands so much, but it's not like I'm obsessive or anything. It's just that there's a lot of things out there that you can catch-- E. coli and Lyme disease and salmonella and mycobacterium, tuberculosis-- it's just-- there is germs all over the place, you know. And that's-- I got to admit, that's the hardest thing about working with the homeless is that, you know, they got the E. coli I all over them. They're used to it. They've had it in them for generations. It doesn't affect them anymore. They eat it in their food. They sleep on it. And you know, to touch one of those guys, it's like, can you imagine the amount of germs in one of those guys' saliva? It's just like a [BLEEP] Petri dish. NARRATOR: Following every lead to find financial backing, James and Jenna Gunn approached their circle of successful friends, including celebrity power couple Jason Segel and Linda Cardellini, star of Scooby Doo. JENNA: Oh, so the other thing is how expensive it is to run it as charity. I mean, like, uh-- like the ribbon that we're using-- we're putting bows on each lollipop, and the ribbon alone cost $15,000. And the paper is the finest handwoven paper you can get, imported from Bali. You can tell it's really good, because it's got all the little squiggly threads in it. That's how you tell good paper. Cost about $80,000. Wait, is it like, um, cloth? No, it's paper. Well, I have a-- OK, since you're going to spending so much money on that, and you're going to be wrapping it, why don't you use it to kill two birds with one stone? -Great idea. -Maybe it's a-- Great idea, great idea. Use it as, like, a napkin. JASON: Oh my god, that's a great idea. And then after eating [INAUDIBLE] You hear that? It's just great. Or you know what? I hate to say while we eat. But maybe they use it as toilet paper. That is a gr-- toilet paper. Why don't you guys just use toilet paper? Yeah, I mean, really. JASON: Put a little-- LINDA: You just draw the little picture. JASON: Yeah. LINDA: Make sure it's not-- the paint doesn't run, and then they-- No, the thing is is that they're going to want to save the artwork, so they can put it on the wall next to them and look at it. The wrappers have-- the wrappers have some of James' artwork on them. Mm-hm. You're an artist? Yeah, you went to my show last year at Merry Karnowsky Gallery. You really enjoyed it. Oh, right, you gave us, uh, that thing. It's up in the living room. It's beautiful. He wipes his ass with it. Just kidding. Just kidding. Linda's joking. She's so funny. That is a great joke. No, that's-- that funny. That is funny. JASON: That was a great joke. JAMES: I don't need anymore. And that's funny. That was-- that was-- Uh, well, listen, you guys have a lot of great ideas. And um-- and we can tell you're really fired up about the idea. And-- And one of the reasons we asked you guys to come-- I know we don't know you that well, but we do consider you our best and our dearest friends. Wow. Not to mention the wealthiest. We consider you guys definitely friends, yeah. We like you. Yeah, you guys are interesting. That mean-- that touches me deeply. It really does. And so-- Well, we would, um-- we would like to offer you the opportunity to make a financial contribution to Lollilove. That's so-- I would love to. I would love you. The operation will cost about $250,000. Are you being-- LINDA: Whoa, come on, now, guys. $250,000, James. James, for lollipops. You guys can't be serious. These are for homeless people, right? Why don't you just give them the $250,000? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, maybe then you-- that's-- good point, Linda, really good point. But I-- maybe you should consider a smaller contribution, say $225,000? The answer is no. I think the idea is a little bit ridiculous. And I think if you really want to give something to charity, just give those people the $250,000. So like, $150,000? LINDA: No. JASON: Thank you very much. $100,000. LINDA: No, I'm not giving you a single penny. $125,000. LINDA: You're going to-- you're going to ask us to lunch under the pretense of a friendly get together-- Here we go. --and then ask for $250,000 out of our pockets to hand suckers out to homeless people? So what you're saying is you're open to the idea, but you're not convinced. No, what I'm saying is I'm closed to this idea. NARRATOR: Less than two weeks into the project, James and Jenna were facing seemingly insurmountable setbacks. Hello, this is Jenna. MAN (ON PHONE): I'm calling from Slucker's candy. Did you call us? -Yes, I-- [STEREO PLAYING] Sorry, sorry, yes, I did. I called you-- I was calling from a nonprofit organization called Lollilove. MAN (ON PHONE): Yeah, we know all about you down here. Oh, I'm so glad you've heard of our organization. MAN (ON PHONE): Listen, Ms. Gunn, if you're going to use our candy, we'll be forced to litigate. -Oh, I'm sorry. I don't understand. MAN (ON PHONE): I will sue you and press charges. No, I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why would you press charges? MAN (ON PHONE): You're using our lollipops. You press charges against me-- [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Excerpts from Jenna's Lollilove diary. JENNA (VOICEOVER): I can't seem to make it work. Everything is going wrong. I don't understand. Jessica took our spot at the church auction fundraiser. I can't believe she would do that. This sucks-- truly sucks. We haven't raised a single dollar. All I can do to myself going is to chant over and over in my mind all of the people I'll become friends with if Lollilove happens. NARRATOR: No matter what the obstacles, James and Jenna know that charity work demands a rare dedication and temperament. To find out whether they have what it takes, our cameras visited one of the people who knows them best. Jenna's the one who helped me realize that I'm suffering from an eating disorder. I know you're not going to believe this, but when I look in the mirror I see a big fat woman staring back at me. But then I realized that that's just the disease talking. You see, I'm an anorexic. NARRATOR: With Jenna's counseling and support, Kathy Rohl is bravely facing her disease. You know, a lot of times when I'm, uh, making sandwiches, I-- if you notice, I never eat the ends. And you know what? As I've been sitting here, I've been thinking this is a lot like what homeless people are in the world. They're the ends of the loaf of life. And, uh-- JENNA: James! Uh-huh. JENNA: James! JAMES: Yeah? I'm in the kitchen. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. What's up? I got a corporate sponsor. Oh my god. Oh my god! Oh my god, can't-- oh, I knew you would do it, though, of course. I mean, I told you from the beginning. I know. Anything you set your mind to, you can do. I know. I know. Right? Yes, um, he wants to have a formal presentation in his office. Uh-huh. Um, so I need your artwork. Uh, what do you mean? Uh, well, he wants to see prototypes of the lollipops. So I'm going to go take your artwork. I'll have it scanned. I'll just make up, like, some mock-up wrappers or something. There's one problem is that I-- this thing really didn't seem to be going anywhere, so I stopped working on it a couple days ago. James, that was the only thing you were suppose-- So. Go work on it now, JAMES: I'm making a sandwich. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING] Whatever you do is fine. I just-- it's late, and I have to still go do, like, a million things, so-- So you want me to turn in crud? No, I just want you-- I just want you to do it as fast as you can. That's just-- or if you have any idea of when you think you will be done. I--there's one-- it'll be done exactly in the amount of time it takes to do it. -OK, I don't-- you know what? I don't-- [MUSIC PLAYING] The homeless need your help. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's great. [INTERPOSING VOICES] JENNA: That's great. This is the script for Larry's office. I need you to memorize this for the presentation tomorrow. All of this? Yes, OK? OK, bye. I love you. Good job. Great job. Wait, wait, wait, which character am I? JENNA: James. And you're Jenna? JENNA: Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BLEEP] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! [BLEEP] [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you ready? MAN: Yeah. OK, 1, 2, 3, go. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: It's-- it's-- it's touching your chin. No, it's not. MAN: Your lip too. Look at that. -Cut it out. MAN: Look at that. What? That's how you do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PLAYFUL SHOUTING] They don't have the kind with the gum inside. And if you don't have the gum inside-- I mean, we're trying to help brush their teeth. That's just regular. That's just candy. [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] I mean, what if he unwraps it, and he looks at it, and he sees that they're obviously not the kind with gum inside? I mean, I just don't want to look unprofessional. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ALARM BEEPING] Oh god. Get up. What? You know, James gets a lot of attention for his artwork. And, um-- and I'm proud of him for that. But I am really proud of how those prototypes turned out. I mean, they look great. And, uh, I think this is going to be my moment to shine. Hi. Jenna Gunn, nice to meet. Larry Fitzgibbon, nice to meet you. James Gunn, hi. -Hi, James, are you doing? -Great. You two want to have a seat. Yeah. Well, we prepared a presentation based on our organization, and maybe we can start with that. -Great. -(WHISPERING) OK. -(WHISPERING) OK. -Ready? -Yeah. -OK. OK. [INAUDIBLE] [WIND NOISES] No, I am an important businessman. I don't have time for you. You are human debris. Oh! The homeless are to blame for being homeless. No! Less than 6% of the homeless are that way by choice. No, the homeless are to blame for being homeless, don't you think? No, many of the homeless are victims of child abuse or violence. 25% are children, many have lost their jobs, and all have lost their homes. But they don't work. They're lazy. Many of the homeless are among the working poor. A person earning a full time minimum wage salary only earns $11,000 a year-- not even enough for an inner city rent. But they are drug addicts pumping drugs into their veins. About 1 in 4 are substance abusers, but many of them fall under the 25% who are mentally ill. They smell. They do smell, but that's because they don't have any showers or anywhere to clean themselves. But I tell you-- I tell you I am an important business man. I don't have time for you. You are worthless. And with that attitude, the homeless will remain homeless. Doing nothing ensures that nothing will change. That is where Lollilove makes a difference. But perhaps if I look within myself, I can see that I'm something more than an important businessman. Maybe I'm a-- You matter. And that's basically it. Why don't you two have a seat. Mind if I set that there? No problem. I want you guys to know that I think that was great. I really liked the characters. I think, really, the only last to thing to do is to see the lollipops. JENNA: The lollipop-- the power's in the pops, right? LARRY: Let's hope so. Let's hope so. Um, I think they're in that bag. No, those are-- that's just my stuff. Uh-huh, uh-huh. They were on the table. Right. Um, I don't-- I'm sorry. I don't have the pops, but we can have them messengered over to you. You guys don't have them? JENNA: I am so sorry. Um. JENNA: I guess that, um-- I was really expecting to see them. [LAUGHING] No, [INAUDIBLE] I can't. I told you already. I can't do it. Yes, I'm eating. Right. -Hey, baby. I can't. I can't. We've got this charity thing. Hey, listen. It's not that it's all that important-- I have to go buy a [INAUDIBLE] hat for the presentation. I just have to do it. Yeah. And I don't want to bring the lollipops with me, because I'm afraid they're going to melt. -No, I can't. No. So, I'll take everything else, but when I honk, will you come out with them, please? Yes. Thank you. You will? Not-- repeat what I just said. You said bring the lollipops out to the car. You don't want them to melt. You're going to honk. -OK. -All right? Yes, thank you. [INTERPOSING VOICES] I'm sorry. I'm very tired. I've got sugar. I love you. Give me a kiss. [INAUDIBLE] No, no, no, oh, oh, whoa. I think it's pretty critical as a piece of the decision-making process that I get to see-- NARRATOR: With their backs against the wall, James Gunn improvised. Larry, if you could just-- I know Jenna should have remembered the lollipops, OK? But if you could just humor me for one minute. It's going to sound silly, but if you could just close your eyes for a moment. LARRY: Uh, that does sound pretty silly to me, James. Let's just-- we could just try it out just for two seconds, OK? Close your eyes for me. Humor me. All right, I will. I have some of my own artistic renderings over here. Here we go. This is what one of the lollipop covers would look like. The name of this particular piece is "You Matter." That's a phrase you heard back there. And to you or I this may be, wow, that's a very interesting picture. There's something about it that's sort of touching. But to a homeless person, he looks at this, and I don't want to get too intellectual on you, but this is like looking in a mirror of his inner psyche. A bum looks at this and says, oh wow, this is what I look like. I look like this guy that's got flies all around my head. I've got smells coming out me. I've got googly eyes going in different directions. And, uh, oh wow, I must be a big huge piece of crud. No sir, you're not, because you matter. And then they would go, wuh? So I also have this piece. This is my anti-drug piece. It's called "High on Joy." A crack addict will look at this and say, what am I doing wasting my life smoking all this crack, when I could be high on joy? Over here, we have a mascot that I've created. His name is Felix. He's created to tune into the Latino community. He's Latino. You can tell he is because he's wearing a sombrero and a poncho, as Latinos do. You may or may not know, but about 75% of all homeless people are Latinos. Where did you, uh, hear that? Well, I've taken my own random sampling with-- there's four guys that live, like, on my block. And three of them are Latino-- 75%. I mean, the one guy is black. He could be, like, a dark-colored Latino. But that wouldn't really make any sense, because that would mean 100% of homeless people are Latino. And Felix has a lot of slogans that'll appeal-- give positive messages-- to the Latino community. Right here, Felix is saying, (BAD ACCENT) no complaining, hombre. I imagine down at the barrio, people will be saying this to each other all the time. It's like their own sort of, what's up, doc? I also imagine some other characters that I'm creating. For instance, I have this guy named Mustafa. He's a Muslim. He's somebody who's anti-terrorism. I think that if the 9/11 guys had seen Mustafa giving them a positive slogan before they got in those planes, they would have said, gents, this is not a good idea. Let's do something else. (BAD ACCENT) Ooh, my name is Mustafa. No longer fly planes into buildings, no? Love your Christian brothers and sisters. JENNA: Larry, we're just going to let you think about it. And I'll have those lollipops-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh, no, no, no Jenna, Jenna, Jenna-- I get it. He gets it. He understands now. I'm ready to go. I'm your guy. You don't need to-- there's no higher authority. So this means you're going to cover the whole deal? I sign the checks around here, so let's get going. Hi, um, excuse me. Hey. Hi, can I just talk to you guys for just a second? JAMES: Yeah, totally. I'm Larry's assistant, Michelle. Hi. MICHELLE: And, um, I overheard your presentation, and it really struck a chord with me. I was just wondering, do you ever need any volunteers or anything, because I would love to help? JAMES: Oh, that would be-- that would be terrific. Really? Yeah. Uh, yeah, um, I'm actually-- I'm feeling very overwhelmed right now, and I could really use the help with, like, lollipop production and stuff like that. MICHELLE: OK. Yeah, I mean that we could really use somebody who's just very, very attractive and bubbly and vivacious. And I saw you earlier, and I was like, wow, who's that? I mean, it's really-- you made an impression. And I think you make an impression upon people, and-- MICHELLE: Wow, really? JAMES: Yeah. You know what I'm saying. -Thanks. JENNA: Well, you'd probably, uh-- JAMES: You're welcome. Yeah, you'd be working with me a lot, doing pretty mindless stuff, like stuffing envelopes. Or you could do more important things by helping me. And I could use somebody to, like, be an assistant to come in and mix my paints, come into my private space, and almost-- MICHELLE: Oh, I would love that. -- act as a type of muse, yeah. That'd be great. I took art classes in college, so I know all about that stuff. I'm so great at that. I knew that. I knew that. I don't know why. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, careful with my art. Seriously. You know, your art's really not the priority right now, is it? Well, I don't care what's the priority. I just want to put it in the trunk. Oh, well, if your artwork gets hurt, why don't you go mix some paints with Michelle, and make it all better? How's that going to help? Just get in the car. Open up the trunk. JENNA: Get in the car! Open up the [BLEEP] trunk, Jenna. It pisses her off when I lollygag or sort of take my time. [HONKING] It's not ready yet, honey. It's not ready yet, dear. I have to just put it right-- Just get in the car! Hey, come on. Seriously, I had to put it in there right. You know, you're just angry, because I shined like a star up there, and you sunk straight to the bottom like a $10 rock. Is that so? That is so. That is exactly so. What are you doing? Jenna? Fine. -What are you doing? -I'm leaving. No. I'm taking the keys, and I'm taking a cab. I don't have any money, Jenna, seriously. That's not my problem. It is your problem. Wait, it is your problem, because this morning I said, who's going to drive? And you said, I'll drive. And I said, OK, well, if you really want to drive, you can drive. -Yeah, who's going to drive? You're the one that-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Who's going to do everything? Who's going to plan everything? No. No, that's not-- Me. Always me. No, it's not always you. Now, come on, seriously, you agreed to drive the [BLEEP] car. That's an oral agreement. That's a legally binding contract. I could sue you over this. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding you. Come on, seriously, all right. Just-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm calming down, all right. Just drive us home, all right? You are in a marriage with me, which means that's-- the basis of that is you being trustworthy, which you are not being at all right now. So-- Yeah, trustworthy. Right. Like me trusting you to remember one thing. JAMES: No, no. But because it wasn't about you, you couldn't remember it. No, no. Because all you care about is your stupid artwork. No, no, what? JENNA: You don't you care about the homeless. You don't care about helping people. All you care about is yourself. You're a-- you're a-- you're a-- you're an egomaniac narcissistic [BLEEP] My stupid artwork? What the [BLEEP] is that? Jenna, if anybody cares anything about the homeless, it's me. You're the one that's on the telephones trying to get on TV all day. The only reason I'd ever want to be on TV is because I know I would be a good example for other [BLEEP] stupid [BLEEP] [BLEEP] people. But you-- you don't give a [BLEEP] anybody. You're just out there meeting [BLEEP] celebrities. All I have ever cared about for my whole life is the homeless-- my whole life has been dedicated to helping those people. What are you talking about? You never brought up the homeless until about two weeks ago. My problem is that I don't even know how to be selfish. So I don't even understand you. You're doing a very good job of being selfish right now. -You-- you-- you-- -Shut up. Shut up. You're a stupid [BLEEP] [BLEEP]. Jenna. I don't have any money! [MUSIC PLAYING] I, James, take you, Jenna-- To be my wife --to be my wife. I promise to love you and let you love me. I promise to love you and let you love me. I will never leave you. I will never leave you. I, Jenna, take you, James-- I, Jenna, take you, James, to be my husband. I promise to love you-- JENNA (ON TV): I promise you-- PASTOR (ON TV): --and let you love me. PASTOR (ON TV): --and let you love me. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSING] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [CRYING] I know. I know. Hey, listen, this thing is bigger than us. We've been called by God to do his work. We can't let this happen again. You understand? The truth is-- is that you're right. I haven't been pulling my weight. I've been afraid if I show my true and whole self that I'll overpower you. And today, in the office, when I showed myself with Larry, I did. I overpowered you. But I realized that's the essence of our marriage. And I promise I will not hide myself any longer, OK? OK. So I'm sorry for that. OK. OK. What are you sorry for? Jenna and James have come to me occasionally during those hiccups of their marriage. And I counsel them. I try to encourage them. I'm not-- I'm not saying, like, she's a bitch, like that's who she is. It's just that she's being a bitch. Do you understand? -Look, now you've spoken. [INTERPOSING VOICES] James, now, you have spoken. Jenna, maybe you should talk for a minute. I feel like-- I really hope they can work things out. I mean, Jenna's such a good person. Hey, Jennifer, come on in. How are you? -Hi. -Hi, how are you? -Good. Hi! Hi! Sarah, how are you? Good. JENNA: What we're going be doing today is we're going to be taking the old wrappers off the lollipops and putting the designer wrappers on the lollipops. [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Despite their efforts to make the peace, the tension between Jenna and James almost brought Lollilove and their marriage to the very brink. JENNA (VOICEOVER): March 4, Toluca Lake, California. James continues to sabotage everything I try to accomplish in life. For example, on assembly day, he kept making ridiculous comments in front of Sarah. Well, maybe if someone had given a Jew a lollipop with "dare to dream" on it before they went to Auschwitz, they would have dared to dream to get out of Germany and not just given up and gone to Auschwitz and gotten killed. Do you understand what I'm saying? JENNA (VOICEOVER): She's Jewish. He can be such a moron. He never does any work around the house. The toilet upstairs is still broken. I cannot pee in the middle of the night, but he doesn't care. I am so overwhelmed. I should've known. This is all going so terribly wrong. I wanted Lollilove to bring us together, and the only thing it's doing is driving me crazy. Does he notice? JAMES (VOICEOVER): Dear diary, ordered a video called "Bumfights" this morning. It's full contact wrestling and fighting with real homeless guys. Supposedly, the winners get 40 ouncers and, like, $3. I totally, totally, totally cannot wait to see it. JENNA (VOICEOVER): God I miss him so much right now. It's like a funeral. We never talk. I try to, but whenever I start, I feel I will burst into tears. JAMES (VOICEOVER): Ideas-- in episode 6, Mustafa can get a new sidekick, Osama bin Awesome-- Osama bin Laden's really cool brother. 2, spray-on plastic sheet to prevent body from getting germs. Also, can slither around on ground-- ha. Seriously though, call DuPont. [SOBBING] Just-- I don't-- he just is-- he's driving me crazy. It's just like it's all about him all the time. He just doesn't seem to understand-- WOMAN (ON PHONE): You just have to be patient. --why I might need something you. WOMAN (ON PHONE): No one said marriage would be easy, Jenna. I know. WOMAN (ON PHONE): It takes a lot of work. I know. I know. WOMAN (ON PHONE): It's a lot of work, sweetie. I know. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Everyone goes through this after a year or so. You have to know that. I just-- I mean-- maybe we just rushed into it, you know? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Rushed into what? Just the whole marriage thing. I mean, maybe we just-- WOMAN (ON PHONE): Jenna. It. rushed into it. I mean, we didn't know each other very well. [INTERPOSING VOICES] WOMAN (ON PHONE): Jenna, are you saying that you made a mistake. No, I-- no, I'm not saying that. I'm just-- I'm just saying-- WOMAN (ON PHONE): Sweetie. --maybe I just need to get away. WOMAN (ON PHONE): James is a genius, and that's what happens when you marry a genius. Every Wednesday morning. You have never woken up early on a Wednesday morning to take the trash out-- not once. You always do it on Tuesday night. That's why-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Why are you doing this right-- why are you doing this right now? Why are you not taking out the trash? Because I don't want to take out the trash. That's why. I can't-- I can't do it-- Oh, that's right. I forgot. You don't want to take out the trash. You don't want to call the sprinkler man. You don't want to do anything. No, I don't. JENNA (VOICEOVER): I can't believe how inconsiderate he is being. Doesn't he love me? Can he be so oblivious to see that I am in pain? I can't go through this alone. JAMES (VOICEOVER): Self portrait-- nude, but different from others. [BLEEP] My pen is running out. Why does the world keep [BLEEP] me? Yeah, um, I spent six months in a halfway house for victims of domestic violence. And when I met Jenna, she told me that Lollilove would just help me feel so empowered around men. JENNA (VOICEOVER): Jenna! JENNA: They're doing the interview, James! NARRATOR: Because the Lollilove mission involves direct, face-to-face contact with potentially dangerous and unpredictable homeless people in oftentimes under-patrolled neighborhoods, Jenna and James arranged for a comprehensive self-defense training session for the Lollilove volunteers. Self-defense instructor and four-degree black belt Mike Tanaki tailored the training to anticipate real life street situations. You put it right in the bum's face. [SHOUTING] Attention. We're going to start with just your left hand and a left jab right into this pad. Yeah. Good, two. Hiya, good, good. You might want to vocalize a little bit. It helps you to gather your--your strength and your power. -OK. 6, 7, [SCREAMING] 8. And 1. [SIMPERING] Now we're to up it. We're going to throw two punches-- left then right into this pad on each count. -OK, I got a-- I got a question. -Yes. If a guy's coming at me with one of these things, why wouldn't I just hit him in the face? [APPLAUSE] Who's next? And 1, good, 2. OK, I got another idea. I hit you twice here, duck, and then I tackle you. And then I make you-- I push your face into the dirt, and I make you eat the grass. That's lesson 10. Can you teach me how to do it? Left, right, back! Left, right, duck! Get up. NARRATOR: To conclude the session with a final test of skill, Mike Tanaki enacted in full-contact simulation. Ha! That's pretty good. [SCREAMING] JENNA: Awesome, you guys. That was awesome. NARRATOR: On the eve of their first encounter with the homeless, our cameras returned to Toluca Lake for final thoughts. I realize tonight that we have-- we just-- we are really going to make a difference in the world. And seriously, that's all I've ever wanted to do. I think we're going to inspire a lot of people. [MUSIC PLAYING] FATHER LLOYD: And the world is going to be a better place with this beautiful gesture. And now, let us pray. Thank you, Jesus, for giving us these homeless people to help. Amen. I saw one of the fliers, and I wanted to help. Also, I'm an actress, and I heard there would be some media exposure. So I thought it would be a good opportunity to, you know, be in front of the camera, acting like I care. [COUGHING] [GIGGLING] There you go. One, and [INAUDIBLE] There's the dirty girl. Great. [CHATTER] Judy, always have your bows facing out. James, come on. Let's go. OK, so we have exactly 100 lollipops between us in our baskets. We're going to hand them out to 100 different people, OK? Oh my god. Honey, what are you doing? What? What? You're not wearing that. Oh, come on, baby. Safety first. No, we are going to be seen by the press, and I'm not going to have you wearing that. All right, then just let me wear the gloves, OK? I'm not going to let you wear plastic gloves. You guys get to wear your special fancy gloves. Why don't you let me wear some of those? Yeah, that's because they're girl gloves. They go with our outfits. You're going to look stupid. Baby, I am really scared. Oh, honey, it is OK. Listen, you do not need to wear all this stuff, OK, because God will protect you. He would not call you to do this work and then not protect you. I know. That's why he put it in my brain to wear this special suit of mine. OK. Come on. OK, thank you, sweetie. Please hurry. Please hurry. We'll go outside. We'll be outside. OK, now the green lollipops are the ones, um, [INAUDIBLE] and operate. So if you have someone that is Latino or that you think might be Latino, give them that-- [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm TeeJay Boyce, on location for Channel 7 News. We all see the homeless on our way to work, on our way to play, but one group of heroes is doing something about it-- Lollilove. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, I smell it. JENNA: I sure do too. [MUSIC PLAYING] We've come down here to help the homeless, and it's a little disappointing, because they're all asleep. I mean, I wish they would just grow up and wake up and take the lollipop. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, sir, would you like a lollipop? It's to help you not be homeless anymore. That character's name is Felix, right there. Do you feel in tune with him at all? Is he-- He's got a hat, like you do. I have a lollipop for you to cheer you up and help you to stay off the streets. Thank you. Sure. So stay off the street, homeless man. Hello, ma'am, would you like a nice Lollilove lollipop today? There you go. What's your name? Delores, I'm James Gunn. Nice meeting you, thank you. Nice meeting you. There's bathrooms over there. I'm going to wash my hand. OK, now? Yes [MUSIC PLAYING] There's no soap. There's nothing to dry your hands. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GAGGING] TEEJAY BOYCE: Founded by community activist Jenna Gunn, Lollilove's mission is to distribute fun, uplifting, designer lollipops to Los Angeles' homeless. We've been handing out lollipops to homeless all day. And the response has been amazing. This is a dream come true, TeeJay Boyce! [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] JENNA: Sir, would you like a lollipop? [BLEEP] your bloody gash. I'm going to stab [BLEEP] your bloody gash. [LAUGHING] Baby, what's wrong? What's wrong? What's up? That guy. That guy. Which guy? He said-- right there. He said that he was going to-- he was going to [BLEEP] my bloody gash. I don't know what it means. But I don't-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] -That-- that guy? -Yeah. -That ungrateful bastard. We've been out here serving in the trenches, saving lives, and he said he was going to [BLEEP] your bloody what? Gash. That's your vagina, baby. He was talking about your vagina. God damn it. No baby, wait. Wait. Honey, wait, seriously. He's got a big problem, huh? Let's see what he says-- feel like saying it to me. Hey, big mouth! Guy, hey big mouth! Hey, big man, macho man, what's your problem? [BLEEP] I think you owe my wife an apology. Excuse me, sir. Sir, you have a problem? Sir, excuse me, I'm talking to you, sir. Come on, Mr. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] Who cares about-- You son of a bitch. You dirty piece of trash. You understand what I'm saying, huh? Come on. You want to say that to me? Want to say what you said to my wife to me? Come on. You want to [BLEEP] her bloody gash. Or do you want to [BLEEP] my bloody gash? Huh? [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] Big man Big man, come on. Come on. Bring it. [SCREAMING] No, no, no, no, my god! Get it off me! [INAUDIBLE] I don't want to touch it! Oh my god, I told you I should have worn my special suit. Call 911. Call 911 now. Where's my cell phone? [SCREAMING] Somebody stole my cell phone. JENNA: Baby, please, the cameras. James, the cameras! Why'd you have to spit on him? These [BLEEP] people. [LAUGHING] You murdered me. You're looking at a dead man. [BLEEP] Oh my god! Oh my god. God save me. JENNA: So this is the part where we tell you how we're doing. Right. Well, we've never been happier. Absolutely. Our marriage is going great. Um, this whole project really brought us closer together. I think that for me it was the moment in the park when James came to my rescue when that man was coming at me. He was just so strong and so brave and just so willing to risk everything in order to save us. And I mean, I just fell in love with him all over again, and I realized that that's really what I want in my life is a strong, loving marriage with my husband. Yeah, I think it was shortly after that we decided Lollilove has to come to an end. I wasn't going to put my wife or my loved ones in harm's way any longer. I think we were a little naive to begin with, not really accurately seeing how many dangers the homeless actually presented. We knew about the bacterial danger, but not about the physical danger. JENNA: It was really dangerous. Um, but we're onto new things now, I-- I think. You know, one of the things on that day-- I realized that Jenna could have been raped by that bum that day if I wasn't around. And I have imagined her getting raped by that bum again and again and again and again. And so I did a little artistic essay with Jenna getting raped by that bum in various positions of the Kama Sutra. It covers three walls. And-- and it's really gotten a lot of press-- not all of it good press-- but as you know, there's no such thing as bad press. JENNA: Yeah, I don't think of this as a failure-- JAMES: No way-- -- no, because we got a lot of great things out of it. Um, I think one of the great things that we got out of it is this documentary-- Absolutely. --which is undoubtedly going to go on to inspire a lot of other people to do a lot of other great things. I think this documentary is going to inspire more people than Lollilove was going to begin with. And you know, you think back to, like, the Holocaust-- a terrible, terrible time? Yes. Worth it? Perhaps, because of all the great Academy Award-winning documentaries that have been made about the Holocaust, all the people that have gone to the theater all over the world and cried their eyes while watching about the plight of those poor people. And that would have never happened-- "Schindler's List" would have never happened-- without the Holocaust. Can you imagine if "Schindler's List" never happened. Yeah, I mean it's-- Spielberg would have never won an Academy Award without the Holocaust. So everything works out in the end. A-plus, baby. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] This piece in particular works really well, because I tested it on a number of homeless people that hang out around the shopping center where I go buy my groceries. And all of them were touched. They didn't necessarily say that, because some of them can't talk. They're like [NONSENSE] But they, uh-- they were very touched. For me, what I'm really into right now is helping people. And if that is going to put me in touch with certain celebrities, I can't help that. I mean, I would to get, like, Jason Priestley on our team. I mean, don't tell James, because he gets really jealous. But, um-- I don't know if you know this, but Jason Priestley hates homelessness. We would have so much to talk about. I mean-- -Thanks, Jenna. -Thank you. -You were awesome. -Thank you. You were awesome. Thanks, James. Thank you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate what you said. Thank you for digging deep. I know that must have not been easy. I know it, because I've been there. You bet. OK, there it is. Thank you. -OK. And that's how we came up with an idea for an animated series. And it's going to be revolving around the character of Mustafa. And Mustafa's going to go around the world, and he's going to talk to different terrorists, and he's going to talk them out of that way of life. And, you know, there's-- it's not about becoming a Christian. It's just about how Jesus is more realistic than Allah. I want to also appeal to celebrities. We have some celebrity friends that I would like to try and get involved. I would like to have them maybe be spokespeople, perhaps do some of our television, print ads for us. But probably most of that stuff they're going to want me to do since it's my art. So probably most of the stuff, they're going to be interested me doing it. And then-- but I could probably have somebody like William Aames as my sidekick, or something, right? Yeah. Or John Schneider. I think it should be somebody of color, because I don't think we want it to just be white people. Like Whitney Houston could, you know-- Oh my gosh, I would love to get, like, Halle Berry, because she's actually half-white and half-black. I'm trying to think of another black person. Um. Eddie Murphy. Mm-hm. Tyra Banks. Mm-hm. George Huff. Mexican people? Well, I-- there's still more black people left. Bill Cosby. But what about black people we know? Sorry.
