So you didn't kill him? You two were the only ones in the room and you said you didn't kill him. Moushmi! No. I didn't kill him. Let me go! I... There is someone behind me. / Who? There's no one there! Those who have no way... Moushmi, no one is here. There is no one here! Tormented ghost spirit. Tormented ghost spirit. He spoke of ghosts and spirits. He made us fools. Sir, do you think he's lying? / Yes, what else? These girls live in PG. They do drugs, seduce boys. There must have been a fight with some of the boys. I have seen many such cases. I want to help you. You think I'm crazy, right? It's not my imagination. Not my imagination. I'm the top in my college. / Impressive. I have applied for Phd. It's not my imagination. I'm not crazy! Are you undergoing treatment for your condition? / Oh Lord! I don't have an answer for this. I don't know why they chose me. I want to get rid of them. Please let me go. / Why did you put up this act? Did you commit murder or not? / No! Did you commit murder or not? No! I didn't do anything! They are. Stop talking trash, Moushmi! You will definitely be punished. Why don't you just admit that you killed him? Admit it.. You don't understand. Stop messing around. Who wanted to go, just left. But they don't want to go. Who, Moushmi? Who is dead! Halo. Moushmi! Don't you miss your sister? Who's this? Is that how you talk to your dead sister? What nonsense is this? Who are you? And where did you get this phone? You know, Moush... I can't live without my phone. After all, I really miss you. That's why I called. What's wrong with you, lady!? I just came back from Sneha's cremation and you... playing this dirty joke! Moush, bahasa! Oh, shut up! Listen. whoever you are. You're bothering me. I will go to the police and file a complaint. That's cruel, Moush. I thought you'd feel better when you heard me. But you're threatening me instead. You let me die for scrolls. How insensitive you are, Moush! I never went to the police. Cremation is very painful. It's burnt! Burned!! / Rubbish! Who are you? Where did you get this phone from? Where are you calling from? Did you forget so soon? Whenever I want to hide, where do I always do it? Under the bed. Moushmi. So cruel, Moush! You let me die Is that how you talk to your dead sister? How insensitive you are, Moush! Cremation is very painful. Burned! Come in, ma'am. Check out this house. What a huge hall! And look on the balcony! Look at this! Oh God!! Good. Good. / Look at this! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Come on, ma'am. / Yes. Let me show you around the house. Honey... / You've never seen a house like this. This is bedroom number one. Nice bedroom. You won't find a house this big in Mumbai! Mari. The magnitude! That's my room. Hooray! Of course. Good grief! Look at this! Check out the view! I love that sight! It's beautiful! Come on, one photo. Do you remember Amy? What drives you crazy, back in college. He is in Mumbai. Should I invite him to heat the house? Mom, cold wind, cold water. All you get here. Then why warm something? / Correct. It's hard to find a house this big in Mumbai anyway. Moreover, you are a single woman. Benar? / Ya. Come on, Mom, let me show you the rest of the house. Single women. Isn't the house nice? / Very good. You can't find a house this big. Then how did you get this house for us? That too, for cheap rent. It's been locked for a year. The owner and his daughter used to live here. I convinced and sealed the deal. Thank You. / Sign and send the registration file. - Of course. - And, ma'am, my commission. Do not forget. - That's it. All the best, ma'am. All the best. / He gone Please give me two more glasses! Hooray! Two girls in town. You wait and see, our life will be made into a movie. And Amey will be the first of many. Hello! I don't have a crush on anyone. Come on, Moush! Mosh, we are no longer children in the path of Unit 9 Bhuvneshwar. We are in Mumbai.. City of dreams. And here, we two best friends will make our own luck. And by the way, someone is going to get lucky tonight. Agents give us so many unnecessary reminders. He should have only warned you! Come on! / Come on! Forget it. / I need to go to the toilet. Me, first! / Hey, me, first! me first! / No. No! Me, first! Go! - Hey. Girls are fast everywhere. Slow girls never go anywhere. / Yes, right. Get out, quick / Find another bathroom! Practice! Prax! Open the door! Practice! Praks! Praks! Praks! Mush! Moush, relax! Relax. It doesn't matter. It's okay, everything's okay. I'm here. Take a breath. What's that? He's here! - Okay, breath. First, take a breath. Nobody! Moush, trust me. No one was there. Look. Look? Wake up. Come on, sit down. Come on! Just relax. There was no one there, except the two of us. Come on, sit down. Honey, take it easy. It has been a year since Sneha's death. You really have to move on. I'll open it. Yes? - Mom, we can't send boys. Not allowed. / No. They're not boys, they're my cousins. They came to carry the luggage. The heavy one. / So, should I accompany him? Take them. Are you ready? Come on, get ready. Look at me! I look like trash now. He wouldn't care, honey. After all, dirty sex is hot! Listen. I know she's your sister. But seriously, you have to move on. And the hot young man needs you too. Now remove your virginity label, it has expired. Bitch, help! Whatever! Come on! Cheers! Guys, you guys are excited. Good. Come closer. Closer! Very cool. Tarun says you guys should shake. Shake shake! Good. What's up with men and glances? I do not know. Is it true? / Yes. You know, there was once an Indian boy. He often glanced at a girl outside the campus, every day. The girl was very upset. That man also embarrassed her every day. So one day, the girl came up to him and told him, if you like me that much, let's go out, let's go on a date. The next day, after some serious thought, the man came to him and told him. I prefer glances. Cheers, for the glances! - Cheers! View this video, all men will make their moment. I really enjoyed my moment. Of course, yes. / Yes, of course. You guys, stop. What? What's that? How are you, my friend!? How are you? Hey / Look at the view, man. What's this? Unlucky. Good. You know, right? Your lip balm is on his cheek. So don't get smart with me. Amey. /ya? Will you help us fix the wifi router? It's in Moush's room. Moush, please help him. Go away. Hm? Thank You. Take this, and shut your mouth. Cheers! By the way. The door couldn't be locked. Risky! Mumbai rains on time, right? Now we also have God's permission. Let's start. Stupid! By the way, it's hot. / What's hot? No lock. Anyone can barge in at any time. Honey, what happened? Who is there? Who are you talking to? Mush! What happened? Dear. Mush... Talk to me. Talk to me. Prax. Prax. / I will call Prakriti. I called him. Praks. Praks. Prakriti... Something is wrong with Moushmi. What has happened? / Unlucky! You wait here, I'll go check. Is everything okay? I do not know. Moushmi. / I thought you loved me. But then you buried me alive. Mush. And now, I'm stuck here. Mush... Moush... / Did you know... How... / Who are you talking to? Are you out of your mind? Who are you talking to? / Have you ever... Moush? / eaten alive by bugs and worms? Mush. Mush. You will all die! Moush! Moush! Moush, bang! Moush... Mush. Mush. Are you okay? Where are the others? Everyone leaves, but it's okay. You've seen some nightmares and fears. Are you feeling okay now? Calm. Forgive me. All this happened because of me. Forget everything. I understand that You're going through a bad phase, but you should really move on. And I'm here. I will help you, I promise. Someone is there. Someone is there! No, Moush. Not again. You also have the same story in Bhuvneshwar. Control yourself. I'm not lying, Prax. There's someone there. Who is it, Sneha? You saw him again? Come on, Moush. Are you even listening to yourself? Listen. We all dream when we are little. But you have to get out of that dream world. Sometimes, people see dreams even with their eyes wide open. Appropriate! When you know it's only a dream Don't let them control you. Leave everything. Start from scratch. And the truth is Amy failed again! You're doomed just to sleep with me. Now sleep again. And let me sleep too. There's no one but you and me here. Turn off the light and let's sleep.. Why are you pissing me off? stop it! So even on that day, it was your sister? That's not my sister. It's someone else. The dead are gone forever. But some spirits are like that they don't want to go. Where? / To another world, sir. They are also not of this world. They also can't get over it. They just keep hanging around somewhere in the middle. And they look for the weak of heart like Moushmi. Pawar, I can't believe in all this. Sir, some people call it a fever, but in our village they call it possessed. And slowly, the spirit catches such a human. When he fell, weren't you there? Of. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Yes, I was there. I made rolls and he just swayed and is fell out of nowhere and then like someone was pushing it. So, you mean your sister too killed by those spirits? Initially, I... I can feel it. Around me. After Sneha's death, I'm involved with them. That's when you committed your first murder. I didn't commit any murders. So, what actually happened to Prakriti that day? Practice. Practice. I'm so sorry about last night. It's so embarrassing. Practice. Are you okay? Are you all right, Prasad? Do you recognize him? It was he who killed Prakriti. Moushmi, your story cannot save you. This girl used to live in that house. One year ago, he died! It's been locked for a year, ma'am. The owner and his daughter used to live here. I'm telling you. I've seen her before, in that house. It was he who killed Prakriti. Sir, believe me, this has five levels. They were looking for a weak hearted girl like this for the first time. Then, they called. Moushmi! Moushmi. In the village, didn't they say You shouldn't turn around when you hear someone calling you from behind. There he is! Moushmi's must have been turn and look. Sir, it is very easy for ghosts and spirits to contact him now. Sir, now they're connected to him. Especially after the death of his sister. They have been a part of his every dream. And the second level. They finally appeared in front of these people. Moushmi. You and I can't see them. They will only be visible to those they want to contact. And the third level is their touch. Sir, if someone from another world had touched him even once, then it is impossible to get rid of them. Sir they will now be seen by Moushmi everywhere. They will never go away from it. anyone who tries to come their way, they will be eliminated. Sir, Moushmi has understood this and also accepted it. This is the fourth level. Pawar, you can't... What's with the light? What happened to the lights? / What happened? Check. / Sir, something is wrong. Kadam, check the lights! Please, let me go. Please, let me go. Help. He was completely under their control. Help. No! - Moushmi! What is going on? What is going on? There's no one there! Get back to your seats, now! No! / You killed Prakriti. Admit it! Moushmi! Pak. Moushmi, why are you smiling? Stop playing this game. Moushmi, what are you doing? What is going on? Fifth level! Say you kill him. / Possession! There was no difference between him and the spirits now. The spirit has really gotten into him, sir. I killed them all! God, keep us away from these evil spirits. Save us from them. Help! Come on, let's run!! Help me. Help me. Please open the door. Every time I have to hide somewhere, where am i hiding? Thanks Everyone
