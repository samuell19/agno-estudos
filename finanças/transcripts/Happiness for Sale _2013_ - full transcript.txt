Mi-na's Corn Shop Are they open again? What's all this? The little brats still steal? Daewang Food? Geez. They really screw around with food. Can I help you? Hi. New owner, huh? My name is JANG Man-seok. I'm the sales director of Mana Food. We sell taste of love and tradition! The good old chain candy! We're different from these junky confectionary companies. We've been around for three generations! Take a look! No one can put a swirl in the candy like we do! Not everyone can make junk food. Only crooks can. This isn't junk food. It got government approval! A-ha! - Is it the Love Potion? - Wow! You know the Love Potion? It was a hit last year! Want some in your store? Kids got that confused with rat poison, right? Yeah, but a lot of rats got confused and died, too! Not only is your company old, but it also uses expired ingredients. The candies lost government approval. And you're still dealing them? Boy, it's hot! Hello, Food Safety Division, please. I'm selling good products here. Food Safety? I'm the expert on food and safety, damn it! There was this man. He was the man of all men whose very presence stupified others. He was like my hero. He reminded me of invincible Kyle from Street Fighters. Was there anyone who can possibly stand in his way? Freeze! There was. My dream changed from that day to become the man who arrests men like him. To become the unbeatable detective CHOI Kang-ho! But I ended up becoming a school teacher. The key! What? Wow! It's open! What's all this? Is this better than Miffy click pen? Dunno. This is too expensive. Where is graph paper, ma'am? Tell me! Where is colored paper? Don't have any. Go elsewhere.

SORRY But I don't like the color. - Then how about this? - Nah. - Let's get this one. - Okay! How much is this? A dollar. I knew it. It's a big rock. How about this one? The color's too strong. - Then this? - I don't like the shape. How about this one? - Let's go with this. - Yeah! We'll take these. They're 50 cents, right? You know that's made of lead? You know lead? If you wear that when you're young you might lose your wedding finger later. No refunds on opened products. Sorry. I'll buy you next time. That's okay. You can't find a better deal for that money. No premium, it's in front of a school, and the owner's nice. But it's filled with junk. We're opening a franchise shop. Don't worry. I'll get rid of everything. What's the problem? Refunds are legal within 14 days of purchase. The box isn't open. Look at the receipt. It's only been 13 days, right? Thanks. Do you have any clay? In the corner. It's 90 cents. What's this? It's new? There're so many scratches on it! It looks used. - Doesn't it? - Yeah. This is so lame. Who likes Top Blade these days? - Right? - Right! Look at all this glue. It's defective. - Isn't it? - Yeah. How much is this? Three dollars. What? That's three dollars? It's $2.50 down the street. - Right? - Yeah. - What a rip off! - Let's go down the street. You! Is that good? Yeah. Really good. They sell it at the corner shop down the street. Why don't you sell it? Cuz it's made of ground up chicken heads. Careful you don't choke on eye balls or beaks. But that's probably lean meat. Pigeon meat. Where were the jumping ropes? Fuck! Who opened this? - Ten! - Eleven! - Who the fuck! - Fourteen! What are you doing here? Why aren't you going home? School's finished. We're waiting for the bus. Who said you can wait here? This is where they pick us up! Look at this garbage! Get lost! But Mr. KANG said we can wait here. Yeah! I said get lost! Geez! Everything's okay at the office? What? Someone's been taking the coins from the coin box? What a stinge ball! People like that should be punished for three generations! Don't worry. Once I sell this place, I'll catch him for ya. Bye. Geez! Don't call me for things like this. Just buy them and I'll pay. It's hard to buy men's underwear. Aren't you gonna see your father? We'd just end up fighting. Don't sit here! No one dare goes near her. I wonder if she's really that bad. Who is she? Listen carefully, everyone! Very carefully! - Once more! - Right. I don't expect all that much from you guys. You don't have to excel in school. Nor be a good athlete unless you're competing in Olympics. But! Do not bother or punch your friends! PARK So-young! You think you're so special sitting there alone? Get over here. Shit. People like that will not be forgiven. - Got it? - Yes. Don't forget your recorders tomorrow! Okay. End of class! - Did you take the jumping rope too? - What? - Give it. - Give what? - Give it! - It wasn't me! Stop right there! Stop there! My chips! I said stop! You're dead meat when I catch you! I was a runner in my day! Oh, yeah? Gotcha! Thought you can get away with this? - Handcuffs! - Monster! Teaching your kids how to go to jail, Mr. Handcuffs? Not yet. It's my first day today. Whatever. This! What're you gonna do about this? Did you really take that? Why else would this be in her bag? Come on! That doesn't mean she stole it. And there's no evidence it's from that corner shop. You can put your hands down. Put them down. What? You're not the only one selling recorders. - Right? - I saw her. How can I believe you? I heard all about you and your temper. And that you shout and drive the kids crazy all the time. Who the hell said that? You mean who the hell doesn't say that? What an ass! What? Ass? What a nasty woman you are! Right, So-young? You were right, Mr. CHOI. I am special. What? A special loser. Teachers and kids don't like me cuz I never bring school supplies. That's why I steal. Mr. KANG was such a fool. He never noticed me stealing anything. So I would steal more and more. Then a kid saw me stealing. The teacher took me to the corner shop and Mr. KANG said that I didn't steal anything. That I was just keeping a tab. He knew everything. When and why I stole... When my dad went to jail and my mom ran away. I was the fool. I didn't mean to steal. I wrote everything I took. What do you want? - Apologize! - For what? He said it wasn't chicken neck, but chicken wings! And not pigeons! Yeah? - Is that a big deal? - Of course! Stop shouting! I'm sorry. Okay? No! Write it on paper and put it outside. What? Write down our corner shop doesn't sell chicken neck! Do it now! Write it! My dad's a good person! - Write that down! - Write it! So your family runs the O-sung Corner Shop? I see... - You a corn chip too? - Sorry? - Do kids call you that too? - Yes. Me too. He's a big chip, I'm a small chip. What's this? Underwear and socks! You special? You're eating alone again? I told you not to do that. You need to learn to share with others! - Look at him! - What? - Geez. - Never mind him. You were a loser too. You know how awful that feels. How could you call her that in front of other kids? Dumb-ass! Idiot! Is there anything you do well? Video game! C...K...H! I have something important to tell you. They'll take it? They're wondering why the shop doesn't have many customers. What are they talking about? The brats come in all day. I just kicked them out that day so it's quiet. You shouldn't have! Customers mean business! They're gonna keep an eye on the shop and decide in a few days. Attract kids to the shop. Let them clear the goods for you. It's made of chicken wings, not chicken neck? Ma'am! Ma'am! She must be sleeping. Guys! Go to O-sung Corner Shop down the street if you need something. Go! Go! Over there. Hey! Get going! Why? Mr. CHOI! Mr. CHOI! - What? - I'm done. Good... Next. PARK So-young. Go for it. Wow! Amazing! You're not only pretty but also talented! Applause! So-young's amazing! Next! Damn! Why keep all this junk no one buys? I think of that kid sometimes. Get lost, loser! Go, you idiot! What the heck? This is my shop! Get lost! We paid for it! Teacher said not to eat junk food. I'm gonna report you. SONG Jang-mi, PARK... You stinky corn chip! Want some? He's good! Let's go! Hey! You! Happy the teacher likes you? Like playing on stolen recorder? What are you glaring at? Hey! You! What? Wanna punch me again? My dad said he'll send you to jail if you do. Where you going? It'd be good to see your dad in jail, wouldn't it? That's true! You little pig! I'll kick your ass! - Let go! - Stop fighting! What's going on? Fighting is part of growing up. I know you can't be calm and rational all the time. That wouldn't be human. So I'll forgive you just once this time. Let's shake hands and make peace. You guys are unbelievable! I know it's not easy, but come on! So you're not gonna shake hands? Then I'll make you! Put your hands in here. In here, Tae-gwon And in here, So-young. Mr. CHOI! Eat with your right hand! I'm left-handed. Damn! I'm gonna pee my pants! - No! - Please! I'm dying here! Don't look, or I'll kick your ass. What are you doing? Stop it! Come on! Shoot! Tae-gwon! Tae-gwon! - Where is Tae-gwon? - Let's try over there. What are you doing? No! No! Tae-gwon! I'll really kick your ass next time! Did So-young do that to your lips? And this and this too. Yeah? - You're lucky. - Sorry? That you know where you're hurt so that you can treat and heal it. But So-young is hurt in the heart so she can't treat it and get better. I'll scold her for splashing water on you. No! She was just trying to help. Then you should be nice to her. Then others will think I like her. - How long have you liked her? - Grade Two... Hi! Don't you need plastic sheets? What's that? This. One, two, three! Wow! Winner! - Gimme one more sheet! - Here! - Try this! - Wow! This is a top. Coil it like this. - You're so fast! - Outta the way! - Wow! - So cool! I'll show you what's real cool! - Wow! - That's so cool! Like this, you can win the eraser battle. Wow! Sis! Teach us jumping rope! One, two, three! You're out! - I'm not out! - Yes you are! - Really? - Yeah. - So what should we do? - Attract customers! Right! Then I can sell all this stuff sooner and get rid of this shop, too! Think about it. Where would these kids go if Mi-na's Corner Shop closed? - To our shop! - Right! So you have to help me sell the shop. - Got it? - Yes. Okay! Cheers to us, corn chips! This goes to O-sung Corner Shop! May it prosper! Prosper! Let's play, So-young! - So-young. - Yes? I was actually a loner. So to get back at other kids, I rang their bells and ran away. That was so fun and exciting at the time. But some time later, I started to wonder why I always ran away. Why couldn't I just face up to whoever opened the door? It's not cuz I was a bad fighter or my mom was a cafe lady. I was a loner cuz I always ran away before others approached me. I wonder what happened to that girl I used to hang out with. Rock, paper, scissors! Take it easy, guys! - Two drinks, sis! - Here. Where are you going? - I'm hungry. - Oh yeah? - Want some noodles? - Really? Of course! Just continue the game. - Me too! - I want some too! All of you? - Ta-da! - Yay! - Guys! - Huh? A dollar, please. LET'S COMPLIMENT! As a way of building up friendship between classmates let's say good things about each other. Say something good about your classmate standing at the front. Like he or she is pretty, kind, or whatever. - Easy, right? - Yes. First up is Tae-gwon. What's good about him? - He buys me snacks. - Oh! He gives you $20 discount at Taekwondo School. - Wow, can I get a discount too? - Sure! Good! Next! What's good about Min-hee? Her dad makes a lot of money so he buys us fried chicken. She's pretty and warm-hearted. Jong-ho! You like Min-hee, huh? Embarrass him, everyone! Next is So-young. Let's list what's good about So-young. Nothing? How about we list what's bad about her? Jin-hee cleans the blackboard every recess and Ji-hye's good at tying hair. Jong-ho found Ha-young's bag the other day. Joo-eun lends out her pencils, erasers and sketchbooks and Ji-min helps her partner with studying. Min-hee has a younger sister who's sick. So she takes her to school and home every lunch. Joo-young helps his mother at the market after school. I see him when I go to my grandma's store. Tae-gwon's always the first one organizing the gym equipment. Use Hadoken! Block him!

What did I do? Look. Are you running some gambling house? This isn't a corner shop. And also... Hey! Just a sec. Look at this junk food you're selling! Junk food? It's all approved by the government! Here. So that makes it okay? Kids got that and rat poison confused. It was on the news last year. You know, a lot of rats died too! You're a complete lunatic, woman! Who the hell are you calling a lunatic? You're a crazy monster! - Don't start, sis! - You want your ass kicked? You're pathetic! I'll kick your ass! How dare you! I'm a teacher here! Mi-na!

Loser? You know each other? Mi-na! Mi-na! You write so well! What are you waiting for? Sign the contract! Oh. So you were keeping the kids out on purpose? Just that day, so that it's quiet. We're gonna get rid of that bench outside. It looks bad having little brats slacking around there. What are the kids like here? They're kind. Innocent and pure-minded. We mean their status. Low class kids tend to steal a lot. And they usually look for cheap things. Look. Yes? Can I get the deposit this week? I need it for something. We have the money set aside. That's not a problem. Good, then! We just need your seals. Here and here. If I were a bird, I would fly far away. Into the distance... Why are you alone? Where's your best friend? His mom won't let him be my friend cuz I failed the Chinese test. You're pretty good. Do you study art? No, cuz I'm too busy with other after-school academies. Why do you go to so many academies? Your family must be rich. No, I just have a lot of siblings. My mom doesn't want me in the house cuz she's tired. All done. Look! See your picture? Do you see what's in it? There are Chinese characters in your picture. Here's the character for 'mountain'. Wow! Here's the character for 'wood'. Right? And the character 'field'. - I'm here, sis! - Me too! - Did you pass the Chinese test? - No. What are you waiting for? Join us! You're all done! Now, then... - What's this? - Moustache! My dad has moustache too! It's so prickly! That's right! We don't like dad's moustache! Cuz it's so prickly! - This is the character for 'father'! - Father! Try it! We don't like dad's moustache! Are you feverish? No, just hot. It's getting hot. But this shirt absorbs all the sweat. It's expensive cotton. Still keep your shirt on. Or you'll get a cold. Okay. By the way. - Don't I smell good? - Sorry? Don't you get it? His daughter bought him underwear and lotion. Oh. And also shampoo, soap, toothpaste and shaver. - And these socks! - You must be so happy. Corn chip! I was just taking a walk. I need to get some change. Why here? I was sure I won the video game but someone keeps on topping me. So I wanna find him and beat him for good. It's good to see you. KBG? KBG! KANG Bong-geun! Your father's got good name. You're so good! Like father like daughter! Your dad always bragged about how good he is at video games. I hated him for that. When he got this machine, I told him I want my name as the best player. So that other kids don't look down on me. But he put his name as the best player. He's so childish, wanting to beat kids. He probably just wanted to play with them. He liked kids. Yeah, except for me. Come on! You're his daughter. He always asked other kids to be nice to you. Then gave them extra papers, let them play video games or taught them to ride the bike. That's probably why kids made fun of you more. So that Mr. KANG would be nicer to them. Like this? Let's put this. King Taejong, Sejong... Who was the next king? - Injong. - Oh, yeah! Injong! Which team are you gonna cheer for on the sports day? She said she's on white team. - Right? - No, blue team! I'm on the winning team. So win. 10 note books for winning team. - Really? - Ten note books? - Delivery, miss! - No thanks. I'm not buying any more. Come on, miss. Take my business card. I'm the new sales director at Joeun Company. I said no thanks! You should put some lotion on your face. Have you seen the ex sales director? He seemed like such a gentleman but he apparently beat up his kids cuz they ate junk food. You skipped the academy today, didn't you? What did I say I'd do if you skipped academy? You even failed your test last time! What's going on? None of your business. I'm his mother. Really? Then why are you so clueless about your child? What? You know what your son tells me? Don't have any children. That his mom hates him cuz she's so tired of kids. How can you blame him? Are you really concerned about our kids? You make them play video games and feed them junk food. It's not junk food, ma'am! It's all approved by the government! Whatever, mister! You're just after money! Are you happy making money off kids? No need for further words. We need to get rid of this bench. I never liked this place ever since that man run the shop. - No! - No! Stop it! The shop's closing down this week anyway. So quit all this. What you staring at? What did I tell you? I told you not to come here. This isn't your playground. Get lost! Go home, people! - Don't close the shop! - Don't close it! - Please! - Please don't close it! - Don't close it! - Sis! Let's drink. This is worse than alcohol. So good! This is it! The taste of home. More like taste of junk food. This is not junk food. It's our best friend. It's the memory of a certain time we lived. For me, it's a taste of bad memory. Then coffee is a taste of bad memory for me. So is milk, herbal tea, and egg yolk. For So-young, rice would be taste of bad memory cuz her grandma sells it. So good! Really? So-young's so cool. Kids must've been touched! But the problem is now that So-young's opening up kids are backing out. It's cuz they're ashamed. Oh yeah! Put her in the relay this sports day. She's fast. Relay? Don't you remember? How I became popular cuz I won a losing relay? - And what if she loses? - Make sure she doesn't! Bribe the other team with toys beforehand. Like your dad did? He did that so that you can win. Mr. KANG had a hard time cuz the kid in the other team told everyone. I guess you didn't know cuz you moved to Seoul. I wondered why that kid suddenly fell down. What? So he cheated on you with another woman? No, he cheated on her with me. What an asshole! Let's listen to music, Kang-ho! You'll never believe what I found. Turn that off. What the heck is that? Stop it already. - Come on! - It's all a memory The love I recollect now and then. Don't you remember? Whatever! I long to see you again only if by chance My very first love! Loser!
