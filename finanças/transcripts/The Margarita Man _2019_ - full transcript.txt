- All right, man, we good? - Yeah, you're set, man, you're all set. Okay. Yeah, you got plenty? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pina Colada and everything, man. - All right, cool, man. - Well, you have a good ride. - So your mom told me you wanna be a zoologist. What is that? - Yeah, well, I'm best at science, you know that, so. - I worry so much when you go away for college. - Mother, are you crying again? - No, it's the onion. - I'm only 10 minutes away, and you've done this every single year for the past three years. - It's just the idea of you not being under the same roof as I am. That just kills me. - Love you, Mom. - I love you, too. And you look so much like your dad when we first met. Not just the way you look. - Oh. - But the way you're always having so much fun. - Dad and fun? Yeah, can't imagine that. - Oh, well, you'd be surprised. - Imagine what? - Nothing, just talking with Mom. - Did you order those school books like I told you? - Not yet. - Miguel, I told you to order those last week. What if the store runs out? Come on, man, you need to learn some responsibility, son. - Okay, I'll get 'em. - Hey, don't give me that tone. Hey, well, maybe since you're not going to school 'til tomorrow, maybe tonight you could come by the store, help me out. Maybe I'll show you that special paletas recipe your Grandpa Jose gave me. - I can't, actually. I'm packing, I have school, so, sorry. - You just don't wanna work. - Don't wanna work? I work with you almost every day, all right? I don't understand why you're always riding me, man, honestly. Recipe, I don't even like paletas, so. - Jimmy, why you have to be so tough on him? Don't you know that's why he acts the way he does? - Yeah, well, he needs to start growing up. I'm not gonna be around forever to take care of him. - He knows. - Well, stop babying him. - Mijo, remember when we took that picture? - Yeah, I remember. It was a fun day, then Dad kept getting mad at me for jumping on and off the bike. - Miguelito, he wasn't mad, he was just being a dad. I did the same thing to him. And when you get a little bit older and have a son of your own, you're gonna do the same thing to him. But how about we continue it tomorrow, huh, and let me give you a lift to school like we used to do in the old days? - Yeah, yeah, I'd love that, actually, that'd be cool. - Okay, but these are... Oh, come on, don't fall for that. I'll pick you up tomorrow. - All right. - Um, excuse me? - Yes? - Do you happen to know where Police Chief Doyle's office is? - Upstairs, third floor. - Why, thank you very much. - Here you are, Chief, just the way you like it. - Oh, thank you, Anna, you make the best cup of coffee I've ever had. It's always hot too, I love that. Oh, Sergio. Come on in here, son. You come highly recommended by Miguel Martinez. - Oh, um, Mr. Miguel, he's a very, very cool dude. - You know that Miguel hosts the most outstanding social event on the campus, and his father is a very prominent citizen of our community. - As a matter of fact, sir, I did know that. - You know, he pushes envelope a little bit, but I can respect that. - Well, sir, it's good to know that this institution has outstanding young boys and girls. - Now, judging from your appearance, you're gonna need a little more than your wits. - Whoa. Is this the Viper Tek Safety Ninja 9000? - It certainly is. And you're also gonna need this. - Are these the keys to the Mobile Unit Police Interceptor? - No. No, no, no, no, no. That is something you'll have to earn. That's the key to the buggy. Now, Sergio, my boy, I want you to go down there and get fitted for a uniform, and get in that buggy, and go out and earn your promotion. - Hey, stranger, any chance you can help me study tonight? You know, it's been a while since I've had a good study partner. - I'm checking in right now, but I'll hit you up later. - Perfect. - Who was that, Kemosabe? - I can't remember her name, but just some girl from my biology class. - Well, I don't know too much about biology but I think you guys have pretty good chemistry. You're crazy, Grandpa. - I would like to introduce to you our new social director of Gamma Delta, Tiffany White, please stand. Congratulations, Tiffany, on your first officer's job. - Thank you for electing me as a social director. I'm very excited about this year. I look forward to planning our events, and I can't wait to get started. - It's never too early to get started. This is my final year, and I want to go out with a big bang. I wanna have an end of the year party that will be one to remember. - No worries, I'm on top of it. This party will go down as the best social event of the decade. - Thank you, Tiffany. I would also like to introduce our new treasurer, Elizabeth Turner. Please stand. - Thank you, guys, thank you. - Congratulations, Elizabeth. She is an accounting major, and she'll be handling all budget. - Hello, I've been expecting you. My name is Jesus. - Uh, what? - My name's Jesus, that's what I said. - Oh. - You know, when I was growing up, my best friend's name was Jesus, but we always used to call him Jesse, Jesse James. And you know, let me tell you a good thing about it is that chicks always go for guys with outlaw names. So-- - This is true. - Think about it. - So are you implying that I should change my name to Jesse James to get the chicks? - Yeah. - Okay. Sorry, I'm a little nervous, this is my first time changing my name. My name is Jesse James with the brains, and I don't play no games. Pow pow. - Pow pow, righteous, right on. - You look a little young to be in college. - Yeah, well, I graduated early. Do you know Doogie Howser? - No, who's Doogie Howser? - What about the movie "Boy Genius"? - Oh, like the Jimmy Neutron movie? - Yes, yes. I'm one of those kids. - Oh, cool. Well, my name's Miguel, I'm your newest roommate, and this is my super cool grandpa, Jose. - Nice meeting you, Grandpa. - Yeah, hey, nice meeting you. All right, I've gotta get going, I've got some girls I gotta mentor out there, you know. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - I will see you later, alligator. - After a while, crocodile. - Alrighty. - All right, there, hey, you, wow. You are too much, Sid. - That's your grandpa? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, he's a little different. - Oh, he's different all right. He's always dropping knowledge, you know, that's why I love him. - I bet. - Is this your first year? - Yes, it is. I actually just moved in yesterday. - Guess it's just the two of us, then, huh? Who was that? - That's our roommate John. He likes to Snoop Dog. - Well, he looks like an old homeless dude. Ah man, oh, in fact, come here, Jesse James, come with me, buddy, come here, come here. Oh, come here, buddy, look at that. Do you smell that? Um, I don't smoke that stuff, man. - No, no, not that. I'm talking about the smell of young, freshman talent just waiting to be discovered. You know what, get your swimming trunks on, buddy, we're going on a field trip. Why don't we, yeah, just step this way. Okay. - Glad you all are here for the college preview. We hope you decide to come here next year. It has been my pleasure as the future president of the associate student government to enlighten you ladies. - Okay, you are pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? - It is not a matter of confidence, child, it's a matter of fact. I am the best man for the job. - Would you like to go for a swim? - Ah, no thank you. - You see something you... Did you see that? - Uh-huh. â™ª Daddy's little girl - Oh, no, there's my brother. - Oh, oh, look, look, look, look. Okay, Jesse James, that beauty over there's about your age. Uh-huh. Perfect. She looks like a really good swimmer. - Uh, not quite what I had in mind, but, um, follow me. Come on, bud. - Okay. - Beaner alert. - That guy was so weird. - Oh my god, I know. Did he say beaner? - Extremely rude. - Yeah. - Hey ladies, how you... Kathy? What, what are you doing here? - College preview. What are you doing here? - Well, I'm the unofficial talent scout for the school, so. - Don't tell me you're giving out free tours of your dorm room. - So that's the talent that you were talking about. - What, ew, no, definitely not. That's my little sister. You know what, we're done, let's go. - Bye, Miguel. Oh my god, that's your brother? How does it feel to be related to a gold medal winner? - Gold medal? Yeah, in beer Olympics. - Oh my gosh, so you're Miguel's sister? - Shut up! Code six, 105 North Avenue 52. - I'm not the university cop this campus wants, I'm the university cop this campus needs. Alfred, Joker's rogues are in hot pursuit. Prepare the Bat Cave. - Get outta my car and stop messing around. Moron, you're on buggy patrol, not vehicle patrol, that's me. You know how long it took me to get where I am? Now get out of my car now! Idiot. - Three, so these three? - Yeah. - Yes, anything else? Sorry. Hello, El Paraiso Ice Cream. - Mr. Martinez, please. - Okay, yes, one moment. Dad, it's for you. - Oh, thank you, Mija. - Yeah. - This is Mr. Martinez. Mr. Martinez. - Yes? - We received your payment for this fall. Now, there's still an outstanding balance for student housing damages from last semester. - Wait, wait, wait, damages? What damages? - Well, there's a $15,000 fee for, uh, the floor for a hot tub removal. There's also four door replacements and new sheet rock for the hole in the walls. - What? - And 2,500 for the window slide removal. - A window slide. - Yeah, our records show that Miguel installed a window slide so he could have a faster exit from his room. - Uh, all right, I'll be down to see you later. A window slide? - This is the best party I've ever been to. No, no, no, best party you've ever been to so far. Now let's take these tequila shots, hmm? Come on buddy, you in you? - Do any of you all know Miguel Martinez? - He's in there, old man. - Miguel! - Yeah? Oh! Dad, what brings you here? - What brings me here is a phone call I got about $15,000 in damages from school last year. - Yeah, yeah, um, I'm gonna, I was gonna, I'll take care, I'm gonna take care of it. - Yeah, you're right, you're gonna take care of that and you're gonna take care of everything, because that's it, I'm not paying for school anymore. - What? - You're cut off. No, son, you need to realize that life isn't just a party. Is this your grandfather's sombrero? What's wrong with you? You're embarrassed of us? - No, I'm not... - No. Let's go, Papa. - Dad! - Yo, dude, Miguel, great party man, great party, I'll see you later, man. - Oh, thanks, bro, appreciate, I'll see you at the next one. - You're going down, I've been practicing with my putter. - Well you better practice 'cause I'm looking forward to this weekend. And all the money goes to the kids. - Right. - All right, I'll see you. - Mr. Martinez. - Oh, uh, yes, sir? - My office. - Um-- - My office. - Oh. - Mr. Martinez, I finally get to meet you face-to-face. Heard a lot about you, especially the parties that you host in our dormitories. - Oh, um, thanks? - Apparently your father doesn't appreciate them as much as the student body does. He's only made one payment. That leaves you with three installments which I don't think you can make. So what I suggest you do is start packing now. College isn't for everyone, son. - Actually, sir, no disrespect, according to school regulations, chapter nine section eight entitles me to a payment extension due to financial hardship, so that should give me enough time to pay your second installment. Ooh, can I have a strawberry? - Can I have payment for the dorm you ruined? Good one, sir. - Now listen, young man, you're on thin ice. Don't mess with the bull, or you'll get the horns. - Hey, Miguel. - Hey. - Hey, man, so how'd it go? - Well, I got an extension, but I still need to figure out how to pay $15,000 for last year's dorm room damages. - $15,000, are you kidding me? - Oh, man, that's not including my second tuition payment. - Well what about financial aid? - That's with financial aid. - Well how much money do you have? - Um, let's see. I think I have maybe like 100 bucks to my name and then I'm broke. - So what are we gonna do now? - There's only one way to spend a Benji. All right, who's ready for another shot? - Great party, Miguel. - Oh thanks. - Can you make me a margarita? - Of course, beautiful, who do you think you're talking to? - You know who you're talking to? Miguel Martinez, the one and only. - Thanks, bud. - No problem, man. - Can we get some more margarita mix? - Yeah, I'll go check the fridge right now. - Yeah. - No problem. - It's just gonna be a second, okay, we have to get the lime aid added to the tequila. - Excuse me, guys. Sorry, sorry. What the heck? There's nothing in there. Gosh. Excuse me, excuse me. Miguel, we have a problem, there's no more margarita mix. - What? - There's no more. I don't know what to do. - Sorry, babe, we're all out of lime aid. Can I get you a shot of tequila while my friend runs to the store for more? - It sounds tempting but we're not gonna be here long. What? - We gotta go. Right, girls? - Right. - Right. - Well, wait, wait, guys. I think I might have something in the freezer. You mind, just two seconds, two seconds. Give me two seconds, I'll be right back. Hey, guys, what's up? Excuse me. Oh paletas. Yes, paletas, yes. - He's such a dream boy. - All right, keep it up. Okay. You're in luck, one Miguel margarita special coming right up, okay? â™ª On ecstasy â™ª With your girl next to me â™ª Come celebrate with me â™ª Friday night and I just got paid â™ª â™ª We pop some bottles â™ª Shorties come our way â™ª Now we gonna party till the break of day â™ª â™ª We aint gonna turn down â™ª We aint never turn down â™ª We like to party â™ª We aint gonna turn down â™ª We aint never turn down â™ª We like to party â™ª We aint gonna turn down â™ª We aint never turn down Tell me what you think. â™ª Turn up the bass â™ª Bass â™ª Turn up the treble â™ª Treble â™ª We going out tonight - Oh my gosh, this is the best margarita I've ever had.

One more margarita coming up. - Great party, Jesse James. - Thanks, guys. - Jesse James. - Hey guys, what are y'all doing here? - How did you get all these people to your party? - What about all these girls? - Guys, relax, it wasn't me it was my friend Miguel. He brought all these girls here just so I could meet them. Oh look, there he is. - Okay, now I'd like to welcome you to the first annual hug a gunslinger party. Now this is the man of the hour, so be sure and welcome him with some nice warm hugs, naked hugs are encouraged. Okay, so let the hugging commence, right?

Thank you. - Hi. - Hello, I'm Tiffany White. I'm from the Gamma Delta sorority. - Yeah, I know. We met at Dr. Valenzuela's office. You're his secretary, right? - Yeah, and you're the guy who throws all the parties. - Ah, so you've heard of me? - Don't flatter yourself. - Well please excuse the way I'm dressed. You know Jesse James and I were about to take a bubble bath, so. - Take a what? - A bubble bath. - No that. You, you're something else. - Step into my office. So, miss White, what can I do to you? - I was just on my way to my boyfriend's and I thought I'd stop by to book a Margarita Man. You see, we're doing a Mexican fiesta theme this year. - Do you have any Mexican in you? - No. - Do you want some? - That is not funny. I just want a Margarita Man for my party. - I was talking about the candy. Walk with me. So, tell me what it is that you need? - I want this party to be historic. - Oh, go on. - Well-- - Oh, hold that thought. Sergio, what's up, buddy? Looking good. - Why thank you, mister Miguel. It is my great honor and privilege to serve and protect this wonderful university as buggy patrolman. - Well, I'm glad you're taking the job seriously, man, you know not a lot of campus cops do. - Well actually, as you know, I started out as a volunteer but now I drive the golf cart but in six to nine weeks, pending good behavior and a promotion I'll drive the police interceptor. - Nice. - And that is where the big bucks are. - Sweet, man, that's awesome. Hey buddy, have you had to use that yet? - Do you mean the Safety Ninja Viper Tek 9000? - Uh yeah, that's the one. - As a matter of fact, I have. The suspect may or may not have been in violation of campus code 501-C3, which is actually jaywalking. - Oh. - However, the suspect may or may not have been myself so technically, yes, but I'm not sure that it counts. - Keep up the good work, buddy. - Why, thank you mister Miguel. - Oh hey. Be careful. Don't taze yourself. - Yes, sir. - And stretch it to the left, one, two, three, four, very nice, five, six. - Hey, how you doing? - Seven. - Coach Lavar. Hey, what's up? - Miguel. Hey thanks again for helping me out with my senior aquatics class. - Oh its no problem, Coach, I had some free time. - Oh cool. Hey I may need your help again next week. - Yeah, okay, just let me know. All right. - So do we have a deal? - Uh, either I or one of my associates will be in touch with your shortly. Okay. All right guys, let's get started. Hands to yourself this time, buddy. - Miguel, I've been having to turn people down just because we're all booked up. - I know, I'm exhausted man. I can't make margaritas fast enough at these parties. - And that's the problem, we got to speed up the process, Miguel, for the business. - You know if we had a margarita machine, not only could we do more parties but we could charge more. - Is that in the budget, can we afford that? - Hey, I can help you if you can help me. - How so? - I want to be a Margarita Man. - Oh yeah, I like that technique. - Oh yeah. - That's good. Okay, good. Almost there. Come on, come on. Oh hey, you're getting close, getting close. 16, 17. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. All right, beautiful. And done! Okay good, stir, stir is important. - Okay.

Good. - Good news and bad news. - Oh. - So the good news is we're getting our margarita machine next week. - All right. - Yeah. - Yes. - But the bad news we don't have a truck. We didn't think of that. - Grandpa Jose. - What? - Grandpa Jose. - I want you to help me. - Yeah, yeah, of course. Damn. - Isn't she beautiful? - Gorgeous. I haven't seen her in years, man. - Wow. This was your grandma's very special gift to me. - Yeah, I know. I miss her. - My very special gift to you. - Wait, gift like giving gift? - Yeah, you think you can handle her? - Where are we at with the South of the Border bash? - I am in the process of-- - Tiffany, you can't mess around with our reputation. The future of our sorority depends on it. Please. - No, no. I've got this covered. I just need to get a few things signed. - Just make sure you get them signed so that we can have this party. All of the alumni will be there and we've got to make them proud of us. Elizabeth, please tell me we have some funding to get some better candle holders. - Hey. Nevermind. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Miguel. - What's up? - I don't know, I just wish I could be more like you, Miguel with you, when you walk into a room all the girls they just smile at you. When they're thirsty, you're there to quench their thirst. I don't even know how to talk to a girl and I just wish I knew how. - It takes time, Jesse James. You know, I wasn't always able to talk to girls. Yeah, it's true. I mean I tried and tried and I failed so many times, man. It's when I decided not to care that they came. You know, it's weird, its like if you give a girl too much attention, she doesn't want you. - Yeah. - But if you don't give her any attention she'll go crazy for you. - How do you do it, Miguel, like how are you able to talk to girls? - You just keep it simple, you know, and smile, all right big smile. All right, no girl can say no to a smile. Now look, I'll tell you what, why don't we go inside, I'll introduce you to a few girls and put those pearly whites to work, huh? Yeah? - Yeah. - There you go. Come on, man, let's go. â™ª Get on up â™ª And dance to this music â™ª 'Cause we are â™ª Free free free â™ª Like the birds in the tree - Hey, Tiffany. - Hey, babe? - Where you going? - I need to go talk to the Margarita Man. I'll call you later. - Okay. Who's the Margarita Man? - Haven't you heard, man? He's the hottest thing on campus, life of the party. But look where he parked. - Oh boy. - Yes. - Miguel. - Oh hey, what's up? - I need to speak to you. - Miguel, Miguel! - Oh okay. Oh, hold that thought. - There's a situation, your car is getting towed. - What? - Go. Your car is getting towed. - Are you all right there? - Yeah, we just didn't do this in PE. - Whoa, hey, sir, excuse me. Sir, sir, sir. Hey, hey that's my truck, what's going on? - Hey my man. You can't park there, Hoss. - I was just unloading, I'll be a couple minutes. - Take it up with the city, my man. - Oh, the Margarita Man. Yeah, this is what happens when you try to park in my spot. - Oh okay, yeah. I didn't realize erectile dysfunction was a handicap. - Listen, poncho, you stay away from my girl Tiffany. We'll call you when we need our lawn mowed. - That's a good one, Mr. Winslow. - Good luck, Margarita Man. - I've got it, I booked the Margarita Man for the big party. - Fantastic. This is the dress I'm going to be wearing for the party. Ow. - Stand still. - I also have a mariachi band that will be attending. - You know, I was worried that Miguel would not be available. I hear he's got other guys doing the party as well but Miguel's the one we have to have. He's the real Margarita Man. - Yeah. For sure it's Miguel. - Hey, Jesse James. - Hey. - Have you seen my brother Miguel you know your partner in crime? - Whoa, what do you mean? We're not criminals. - No, it's just an expression. - Okay you startled me for a second. - Yeah. You know, you have a cute smile. If you combed your hair back it would make you look more attractive. - Would you care to sit down? - Yeah. - Kathy, I've been needing to talk to someone and since you're Miguel's little sister, I feel like this is an appropriate time. So Miguel, he's a really really nice guy and I do look up to him but I just feel like he cannot fail no matter what we tries and no matter what he does and I don't know if its just me being a person that loves books and algebra and biology and world history, I'm not good at the social life, if you know what I'm saying. What would Miguel do? - Well pretty much anything he wants. - Seriously? - Yeah, he can get away with anything. - Did you get the truck out this morning? - Yeah but it ended up costing us $350.00. - Ouch, man. Freaking hate that guy. She's way too good for him. Who's way too good for him? - Tiffany, she's way too nice for that dude. He just rubs me the wrong way, you know? - That's the one who booked us for the real big sorority party, right? - Yeah. Actually, can you have John do that one? Yeah, have John do that one. - John? I thought you liked her. - I thought I did, too. - Hey, Miguel. - Oh, what do you want? - I need to talk to you about the South of the Border bash. My sorority wants you personally to do the party. - No way. I'm having one of my other guys do it. - But my girls want you to do it, please. - No, your little boyfriend had my truck towed yesterday. Didn't you know? - I'm sorry, I had no idea. - Yeah, I'm sure you didn't. - I really didn't. - Fine, so what's up then? - Well are you gonna help me or not? - I don't know, it's gonna cost you extra. - How much? - You have to buy me lunch tomorrow. - Lunch, that's it and nothing else? - Of course. What kind of guy do you think I am? Well anyway, Pretty Little Liars is on and Hannah just got back with Caleb, so. - I hate that Margarita Miguel. What's wrong with him is that he makes his people think they actually belong in our world. What are we gonna do about him? - We need to run him out of business. - No, we need to do something much worse. - Dude, I got it. We can get him deported! - Not all Mexicans are illegal, you idiot. Oh, Sergio. - Actually, uh. Actually. Of whom are you speaking? - Miguel Martinez, the Margarita Man. - Oh, actually, Miguel is my best friend. He sells margaritas to all the outstanding boys and girls of this fine institution. Like his dad who sells paletas in their community. - Hey uh, what's a paleta? - Stupid, Mexican ice cream popsicles. - Actually, they're very delicious. You can find them at Paraiso on Fredericksburg Road. Good day, gentleman. - Do you hear that, Zach? Mexican ice cream paletas on Fredericksburg Road. That's right down the street. - Oh yeah. - Sounds like it's time for a family reunion. - You're a stallion, you're a stallion. Hey. - Hey. - So you ready for our date? - It's not a date, just lunch. - Yeah all right, well let's go. Your carriage awaits. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Come on. Get ready for a ride like you've never seen. - Where are we going? - It's kind of a surprise. - Okay. - Just letting you know, it's going down. - Oh, okay. - I got this. I'm a professional, don't worry. I drive this everyday. Uh, where's the seatbelt? - These are so great. These are great. - Well you still owe me a dance, so. - I said just lunch, nothing more. - Yeah huh. Grandpa Jose, hey. - Hey, welcome back to our holistic movement retreat. They missed you. - Well it's good to be back. Oh by the way, this is my friend, Tiffany. - Hello. - Oh, any friend of Miguel's is a friend of mine. Wow, que bonita. - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. You know I would like to introduce you to my good friends. We served in Vietnam together. - Oh okay. - Lee. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you. - We've been fighting for the good ol US of A. The red, white, and blue since what even before the Civil War, que no? - Wow, since before the Civil War? I did not learn that in my history book. - Well, you know what, neither did we. - Thank you for your service. - You're welcome. - Has anybody told you that you look like Ginger Rogers? - No, but I can assume that's a compliment? - Oh yes, it is. He's a charmer, isn't he? - Ladies and gentlemen, this song goes out to my grandma, who forever dances in my heart. I love you, grandma. â™ª Tonight â™ª Is a night â™ª That we belong together - This was my gal's favorite tune. Would you do me the honor? - I would be honored. â™ª You were a star in my life â™ª Tonight - You know Miguel has been coming here even after his grandmother passed away to entertain all the old folks and you know what? - What? - He's never brought anyone here before. - Well. I had no idea. - Oh yeah, now you know. You can tell a lot about a person by the way he or she treats people. â™ª I need you â™ª To feel your â™ª Arms around me â™ª I'll never let you go It's beautiful, huh? It's amazing. - Is this your first time here? - Yeah, I had no idea this was even here. I love it. - Yeah. Come on, let's go look at the waterfall. - I wish Winslow would take me to do things like this sometimes. - He never brings you out like this? - Never. - Hey, you see that green building over there? - Oh yeah. - It's called the Tower of Life. - Okay, and what is that? - Did you know that they shot Ghostbusters there. - Wow, I did not know that. That's pretty awesome. - No, I'm just kidding. It's just a really boring building. - Oh my god. - It's less cool but. Yeah. â™ª Tonight â™ª Is a night â™ª That we belong together â™ª Forever and ever â™ª In my heart â™ª From the start â™ª I knew â™ª You were the star in my life â™ª Tonight â™ª Is the night â™ª And now we are together â™ª Today and tomorrow and always â™ª â™ª To the end â™ª All my love â™ª All my life I love kids. They're so funny. - Probably 'cause you've never grown yet. - Yeah probably. - So, what made you want to be the Margarita Man? - I don't know, I kind of just fell into it. I've always loved watching people have a good time. I guess I just didn't want to be like my dad. - What do you mean? - Enough about me. How long have you been with your boyfriend? - Since freshman year but his dad and my dad were college roommates. - Oh you poor girl. You never stood a fighting chance. I mean it was practically prearranged. - You're something else, you really surprised me today and I am hardly surprised by anybody. - Is that a good thing? - I guess we'll see. - Oh hey, John. Good news man, we made your money back. So here you go, man. - Thanks, Miguel. - Thank you, dude. - Oh so, how's it going with the chicks? - Hey, John, did you find any? - Oh yeah. - I found some. - Okay, back to reality. - Oh sorry, so Miguel with all the money that we made from the end of the year party for the Gamma Delta sorority, we're able to pay for our rent and the tuition. - Hey, that's good news man. - I know. - All right, cool. Oh uh, Kathy. Could you do me a huge favor? Would you mind running to the warehouse and picking up those lime paleta boxes? I'd really appreciate it and little sis, thank you for being here for me. - Miguel, Kathy, is it okay if I give you a ride? Can I give her a ride? - Okay. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Be careful. All right, I will. - Thanks, mister. - I hate kids. - So, Denise was telling me that she's pregnant with Tim's baby. - Cool. Well, we need to cut this walk short 'cause I got a student government meeting to attend in 30 minutes. - Ginger Rogers. So nice to see you again. Such a kind lady. - Nice to see you. Bye. - I hate old people. What the heck? - Looking pretty good there, Winslow. - I do look pretty dapper if I do say so. - I have some very disturbing news for you, old boy. Could be nothing but it didn't really look like nothing. - Spit it out already. - I saw Tiffany on what could only be described as a date with Margarita Miguel. They were in a museum laughing and frolicking around like a bunch of little schoolgirls in love. - Well, we definitely need to show Margarita Miguel where he truly belongs. If he thinks that a little bit of ice and some tequila is going to compete with proper breeding. - Maybe we should arrange a little visit with our brothers. Give him a little rough conversation. - Mm, no. Let's keep it between you and I. I have a better idea. Get the number to his Dad's Mexican ice cream store and let's just show Tiffany how cool Margarita Miguel really is. Operation Paleta is in full swing, right? - Sounds like a plan. Let's do this. - Ladies, as we have all been anxiously waiting, I present to you, Miguel the Margarita Man. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Fiesta, the ultimate party. Have you wondered what life would be like without a party? I shudder to imagine such a horrible thing. Now, for normal folk, I usually come in my costume with just a single Margarita machine but for you ladies, I've got so much more, so much more planned. And now presenting, the South of the Border band. Yes, yes. - And now, for our special guest. May I present to you, the one and only Mexican paleta man. - Paletas Paraiso por todo. - Paletas for the pretty ladies. Paletas for the pretty ladies. - Miguel? Well, now I guess we're both embarrassed, huh? - What, no Mexican hat dance? - Miguel. - What, what do you want? - You just left the meeting. - And what, what did you expect? I mean now everyone knows my dad's a paleta man. It's humiliating. - Why does that bother you? - I don't know, it's, yeah I just didn't want everyone to know that my family runs a paleta company. You know, my dad sent me here so I can be a better person so I can grow up a little bit. - Don't be afraid of who you are. I mean, you are so special to me and everybody around you. Don't be embarrassed of that. - Thanks, I guess. Want to come in? - Sure. - All right, I'll be in the back. - Girl is taking all my profits here. You really like these, don't you, mija? - Yeah, my friends at school really enjoy them. - Well here, look. Take this box of lime. I know your brother really likes them. Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. I'm looking for Miguel's dad. - Oh uh, actually guys. Let's take five, okay, I have to deal with a stalker. Don't make me get a restraining order on you, now. - Very funny. So, I went to your father's shop and talked to him about how you felt. - You went to see my dad? - Yeah, I mean he loves you so much and he's worried that things might come too easy now and when things get rough, you won't be able to handle it. I mean, life isn't always a party. - How 'bout you stick to party planning and leave planning my life to me? Okay. - Why are you stopping? - Look how cute the kids are. How awesome would it be to be a kid again? - Stop being childish. Let's go. - All right, listen, guys. I have amazing news. I have been getting phone calls all over San Antonio and all over central Texas saying that they want their own Margarita Man. How 'bout that? - I can't believe she went to see my dad. - You can't blame em. It's the best move I ever made. I may still be in my room a lot but at least I'm not in there alone anymore. - And then she says that he might right. Like seriously? - Miguel, would you care to join our conversation about us? - Maybe she is right. I'm sorry, guys. This is a first for me. - Or maybe you really like this girl. - That's true. - I don't even feel like a party right now. It's unbelievable, I always feel up for a party. - I think it's time I had the talk with you, Miguel. What are you doing? - What? - What are you doing? Stop, stop. - What are you doing? - No, you're supposed to peel it. - Miguel Martinez? - Uh, yeah what's up? - I have an urgent message from Tiffany. - Oh, thanks. - You're welcome. - What is that? - It's a message from the sorority house. It's an invitation. - Well, what does it say, open it up? - "Miguel, can you please join me tonight? I'd like to share a very special moment with you." XOXO Tiffany. - Is this a good thing? - Have you completed all of your pledge interviews? - I have one more but I think I can have it done by tomorrow. - Tonight. - Well, hello there. - Okay, scram. - If it isn't my favorite racist. How's it going? - I assume you parked in the proper place. I'd hate to see your vehicle get towed. - Well, thank you so much, Mr. Slow. It is Slow, isn't it? First name Win. - No, it's Winslow Huntington the third. - Oh. - That's my full name. Of the Travis Park Huntington. I'm sure you've heard of us. Chances are we've employed your family before. - That's good, that's really-- - Oh, sorry, man. - Watch where you're going, man. - It's cool. - Well, see you later, Slow. - It's Winslow. Winslow, not Slow. - We got him. - Is that that new? - That is the Safety Ninja Viper Tek 9000, sir. - I've been thinking of getting me one of those. - Sir, I highly recommend it. - Keep up the good work, officer. - Thank you, sir. - And this is a man who needs no introduction. Dr. Valenzuela. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. And thank you all for joining us to welcome our new student body president, Winslow Huntington the third. - Hello, everyone. Today is a big day for me and all of us. Today, we celebrate the future of our great university. - What are you doing here? - I thought you invited me? - Starting today, we will make this university great again. Tiffany, there's something I'd like to share with you. Tiffany, would you be my wife? Oh my god, did he ask her to marry him? - No. What is going on? - Where's the ring? The ring is missing. The Margarita Man stole it. - That's impossible, not mister Miguel. Mister Miguel, mister Miguel. He's an outstanding student. He's a cornerstone of this institution, actually. - We will get to the bottom of this. - Mister Miguel, mister Miguel. - Sergio? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But I know you didn't do it but I need to search you. - Search me, search me for what? - The engagement ring you stole. - Oh come on, that's ridiculous. - I'm so sorry, mister Miguel but I'm only following procedure. Arms up, please. - Oh, okay. - Mister Miguel. - No way. - Say it isn't so. You are not a thief. - I'm not a thief, I didn't take it. - I knew it. You can't ever trust a Mexican. - Tiffany, come on, I mean you know I didn't do it. You have to believe me. - Your dad is gonna have to sell a lot of paletas to get you out of jail. - They're gonna take away your green card, also. - What's with the Mexican jokes? I mean, I never even been to Mexico. - Sorry, mister Miguel, I'm so sorry. - You have to do the cuff? - I'll do them so they don't hurt. I'm sorry, mister Miguel, it's procedure. Watch your step, sir. - Now this is a dag gum shame. Them Huntingtons have been generous donors to this campus for generations. - Well, that Winslow Huntington the third has been working hard to be student body president for the last three years now. - Yeah, his daddy done the same thing. I'm surprised he waited this long with the influence that family has over this place. - Pardon me, Police Chief Doyle, I'm sorry for the interruption. - Oh that's all right, just sit down here. What's the latest on this Miguel Martinez deal? - Well sir, I've apprehended mister Miguel and he's currently in the campus holding facility. I just, I just feel terrible 'cause, as you know, he's my best friend in the whole entire world and I swear he would never do something like this. However, I did find the stolen engagement ring in his very own pocket. - Uh whole entire world, you say? - Sir, yes, sir. - Uh huh. Well, that's what happens when they get to drinking, you know they start doing all the wrong things that are not right. - Right, sir. Drinking is bad unless it's in the appropriate time. - That Winslow Huntington the third, though, rubs me the wrong way. Kinda like a tick you can't get unbedded. I just hope Miguel Martinez isn't pissing away his future. I'm gonna assign you to get to the bottom of this deal. - Why thank you, sir, it would be a great honor. - That's my seat. - I'm sorry. - That's my seat, too. - Miguel Martinez, you're free to go! I'm just glad you're out, man. - Yeah, I used your tuition and rent money to post your bail but how did that ring get in your pocket, anyways? - I don't know. I just can't figure it out. I was exiting the building and then the next thing I know Sergio approached me and pulled the ring out from my pocket. I don't even know how it got there. It's like, it's like someone planted it on me. - So, what are you gonna do now, man? - I need a drink. - Don't let this situation upset you, dear. - I can't believe Miguel stole the ring Winslow was gonna give me. I mean, it's not like him to go and do something like that. - You know sometimes you just can't tell about people. Can't judge a book by his cover. - What does that even mean? - Miguel has one foot out of this university. His father stopped paying his tuition. So Miguel has to pay his own way. - Do you think he's guilty? - I think people do drastic things when the pressures on. - You see what I see? - Ah, the three amigos. - Yes, it is our ring thieves. Come on, let's go. - Yeah. - Hey, look who's coming. - Oh crap, not this guy again. - Well, well, well. If it isn't the ring thief and his accomplices. You know, Tiffany tried telling me that you were a good guy and I just couldn't believe it. Your people just can't seem to keep your hands to yourselves. Looks like your American dream of being an entrepreneur are over. You know I also heard from Tiffany that Dr. Valenzuela wants to see you in his office in two hours. Face it, muchacho, the better man won. Let's go. Muchacho. - He's so racist. - So what are we gonna do now that the Margarita Man got expelled? - I don't know but Tiffany better figure this one out. - I... I've got to go. - Emily, why aren't the candlesticks Bedazzled yet? If you're so busy get one of the pledge to do it. Have I taught you nothing? - Tiff, Tiffany. Come on, I know you're in there. Open the door, Tiffany. Come on. You won't take any of my calls. You know you better open this door right now or else I will break it in. All right, all right. You've got till the count of three. One. Two. Don't make me do it, Tiffany. Okay, three. You know, you're really lucky that I hurt my shoulder playing polo today because... I demand that you open this door right now. You're throwing your future away. I mean, do you know how many women there are wanting to be Mrs. Winslow Huntington the third? Huh? - Dude, it's official, Margarita Miguel is history. My girl in Valenzuela's office just texted me and she just told me that he was expelled. - This almost worked out perfectly. I knew once we planted a ring on Margarita Miguel that no one would believe that he did not steal it. I mean, who's gonna believe a Mexican ice cream boy who can't pay his bills and is getting thrown out of school? - I know, and the best thing is the ring got back safe and sound. No one being the wiser. Who would suspect that two outstanding citizens such as ourselves would have anything to do with this. - Now if only Tiffany would just wake up and smell the coffee, she would realize just how lucky she really is. I'm sure she'll snap out of it once Margarita Miguel is out of the picture. All right, let's go. Hello, this is Miguel, the Margarita Man. Sorry I couldn't get to the phone but go ahead and leave me a message, bye. - Miguel, this is Tiffany, call me back as soon as you can. I know you didn't take the ring. Just call me back. - Hi. - Oh, is Miguel here? - No, he's not, sorry. - Okay, can you leave a message for me? - Mhm, sure. - Can you tell him to call Tiffany as soon as he can? - Okay, you got it. Bye. - Thanks for meeting with me, Dr. Valenzuela. I'm having some issues with my financial aid, I was hoping you could help me. - Well, now first we can speak with your student councilor and see if you can't get a little more financial aid. How are your grades? - Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. - Excuse me, Dr. Valenzuela, I need to speak to you for a moment. - Uh, we're in the middle of something here. - I have a favor to ask you. Hello, this is Miguel, the Margarita Man. - Just the guy I've been looking for. - The newest model of the Ford police interceptor. Oh stop. I couldn't possibly. It wouldn't be gentlemanly. Oh, I'm so glad you ask. In six to eight weeks, depending on if I make an arrest, pending a promotion, you will be mine and I'll be inside of you. No. - Sergio? - I wasn't stroking it. - We need your help. - Yes, ma'am, ready to serve and protect. - What do you three want? - Nobody messes with mister Miguel. - Okay? - Prepare to meet the Safety Ninja Viper Tek 9000. - What you got there? - It's a picture of us when Miguel was five. Do you remember it? - Of course I remember it. Miguelito and I were looking at that same picture right before he went to college. - Dad, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I mean I just can't seem to make him understand that life is not just a party. - Wrong right. Right wrong. It wasn't that long ago you and I were having the same discussion. - It's not the same, Dad. - The world is the same. Only now you're not the invisible son, you're the worried father. Remember when you crashed my paleta truck? That's the way life is. I've learned a lot from you, son. Miguelito knows you love him. He can feel it. Now he has to hear it. Just let him know. I love you, son. - Miguel! Miguel, listen to me. - What do you want, Jesse? - Please, you don't gotta leave. - What are you talking about, Jesse? - Just hear me out. - What are you talking about, Jesse James? I got expelled from school. - No. Winslow and his boy, they confessed. They confessed Miguel, they confessed. - It doesn't matter, man. I mean if it's not this it will just be something else. I don't belong here. I'm not fooling anyone but myself. - The only thing that's holding you back is you pretending to be something that you're not. - I'm a nobody, man, and I'll always be a nobody. It's time to grow up. - You are a somebody. You took a common drink, a margarita, and you turned it into a thriving business. You were able to pay for your tuition and our dorm room payment. When times got rough, you know what, you kept your head up high and you didn't quit, you want to know why? 'Cause you're not a quitter. You're not just an average Mexican American. You helped the team. You helped John, a stoner that never came out of his room, and most importantly, you helped a geek. A kid who had no self confidence, a kid who couldn't even walk up to a girl and you know what? That kid is me. That kid is me, Miguel. So you're not a nobody? And you will forever and always be remembered as the Margarita Man. So come on, man just just, get your head back up. - Look, we both know I'm not very good at apologies but I just want to say I'm sorry for everything, for all the crap that I've put you through these past few months. You know I never realized just how good I had it until I almost lost it all. I'm sorry. - I never meant for you to think that I wasn't proud of you, son. It's just that all your life you've always had it so easy. You've lived your life as a charmed young man. It's been so easy for you and I was trying to teach you how to take responsibility, how to grow up. Especially for times like this when it gets rough. - Yeah, I know that now. I know now more than ever that I'm way more like you than I ever thought and that's why I am who I am today. You know? I just want to say thank you for everything and I love you. - I love you, too, son. All right, things will work out. Let's go get this thing straightened out. - You know, I do like paletas, by the way, I love them. - Your honor, I make a motion to dismiss all charges against my client, Miguel Martinez. - In light of the new evidence that has been presented, the state no quorums in dropping all charges against Mr. Martinez. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way to go. - Now, if there is no more business for the court. - Actually, your honor. - Mr. Martinez, your case is closed. You may go home. - Well if I could just have a minute to address the courtroom, your honor, that be great. - If you wish but you need not say anything. The District Attorney has the statement from the pranksters and the state has dropped the charges. You may go home. - Just a minute, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to say that I truly appreciate the support and love from this community. To my friends and family I just want to say that I really do appreciate you having my back and your support in my time of need. - Mr. Martinez, most people when their case is closed they go home. - And to those of you who I may not remember your names, I do apologize. But I really do appreciate you being there for me, okay? Especially you first row first seat. And last but not least, Tiffany. I am so sorry for not trusting in you. I really hope you can give this Margarita Man a second chance. - Oh for crying out loud. This is not the People's Court and I am not Judge Judy. Case dismissed, everybody out of here. - Hey come on over and have some tamales, later, judge. - Miguel, my man. Why aren't you ready for the party? - Just got a few things to take care of first. You guys haven't heard from Tiffany, have you? You haven't gotten any messages, texts? - No. - All right. Yeah I haven't talked to her since... - Hey guys, y'all going to the party? - Well, duty calls, man. - Have a good time. Be careful where you point that thing. - Hey, Miguel. Don't worry, things are gonna work out, man. You've helped a lot of people. - Thanks, man. Dr. V? Miguel, stop by my office before you go to that party tonight. - Uh, yes, sir. On my way. - Mr. Martinez, two things that I'd like to talk to you about. - Of course, sir. - First is, I was really disappointed when all this mess came down. I want to tell you that I was wrong about you. You're a great student and an asset to his university. You bring pride and camaraderie to the institution and the board has decided to refund your bail. So right now you are at a zero balance for housing and tuition. Congratulations, young man. - Wow, I, I don't know what to say. Thank you. - A good friend of yours came by and explained everything. Told us about your personal problems. You're a fine student. - Oh well thank you, Dr. Valenzuela, wow. - You take care of my secretary, 'cause she's the best one I've ever had. - Of course, sir, and again just thank you. You know, I won't let you down. Thank you. - Pleasure to have you. - Thank you, sir. - Hey, stranger. - Hey, miss biology. Well I knew you had good chemistry with Miguel but I had no idea you'd be interested in his granddad. - I guess it's hereditary genes. - Oh there's a lot in those genes. - Hopefully more than what's in Miguel's jeans. - Oh you are so cold but you look so hot. Come on. - Oh mijo, I have to tell you, I'm so proud of you. This is a great party. Congratulations, good job. - Thank you. Thank you, Dad, I appreciate that. That means a lot. I'm glad you're having a good time and how 'bout you, Mom, you having a good time? - I'm loving it. - Yeah? - Yes. - Awesome. - Hey, maybe now you can think about helping me take the paleta company to the next level. - I tell you what how 'bout we do it together, as a family? - Yeah? - Yes. - All right, then. So, to El Paraiso. El Paraiso. - To the Margarita Man. Yes. - Salud. - Salud. Oh, son. I think there's somebody that wants to talk to you. Go handle your biz, mijo. Orale. - Wish me luck. - Andale, mijo. Uh huh. Hey. You realize how happy you make me when you get along with him? - Yes, I do. - Hey. - Hey, guys. Would you mind giving us a second? Thanks, thanks. - Oh aye aye aye, you remember those times? - Like it was yesterday. - Really? - Really. - I love you so much. - I love you, too. And I'm gonna dip my paleta-- - Hey, hey. Crazy, crazy. - It's so cute but I don't. 'Cause I feel like... - They intertwine, so one thing with the other-- - Hey, Kathy. - Hey, I'll talk to you later. - Okay. - Bye. Hey. - Hey. How you doing? - Good, you know this is a fantastic party, by the way. - Thank you, thank you. That means, that means a lot coming from you. - Really? Why, I'm just Miguel's silly little sister. - Oh I don't know why I'm telling you this but it's because I don't see you that way. - How do you see me? - There's just something about you. You're so beautiful and my feelings for you they changed. - You know, you're really living up to that name, aren't you? You're a good guy, yourself. - Thank you. - Let's dance. - Yes. - It's a pretty good party. - Yeah. - Oh my god, who is that? - Oh I think that's Johnny the stoner. - Hold my drink. - Oh my gosh, she's gonna go talk to him. She's so crazy. - Hi. - Can I have one of those? - Yeah, sure. Margarita especial. - It's very sweet. - Just like you. - Want to get out of here? - Yeah. - Well that definitely didn't go as planned. - I would say not. - What does Margarita Miguel have that I don't? - I don't know. - Actually, I can describe for you precisely the traits that mister Miguel possesses that you two rouges do not. He possess dignity, he possess respect, and he possess a best friend named Serj, who happens to be the fine owner of the Safety Ninja Viper Tek 9000. - Can I get you a margarita? - Oh, what flavors do you have? - Vanilla. - Come on, I need something with a little more spice. - Oh, spice? Let's see, think I might have something back in the room. - Oh do you? Huh. - You wanna? - Okay. - Yeah? - Let's go. â™ª Margarita Man â™ª You're the life of the party â™ª And I'm your biggest fan â™ª Margarita Man â™ª Can I get a one round â™ª Two rounds â™ª Three rounds â™ª Of that sweet blend â™ª Oh when the sun goes down â™ª We'll be living it up â™ª I got my dance boots waiting in the pickup truck â™ª â™ª We got the band â™ª But we need the man â™ª And when the well dries out â™ª And the party ends â™ª Well I'll be ready to roll all over again â™ª - Well, here are the rest of the closing files for Miguel Martinez. - Thank you, Detective Anna. You truly are the best. - Thank you, Chief. Things are back to normal in Miguel's world. - Well I'm glad to see things worked out for Miguel. He's the kind of student we like to have on this campus. Ah, Sergio, come on in, son. How's our boy Miguel, how's his little fiesta event going? - Uh, sir, yes, sir. Actually, I've taken care of the liar Winslow and his creepy little friend, Zach. - Oh that's a fine job, Sergio. Have a seat, son. - Why thank you, sir. - Do you know what we do to officers who go beyond the call of duty on this fine campus? - Well, um, actually, sir. I do not know, actually. - Uh, Officer Anna, would you do the honors, please? - Excuse me, sir, is everything all right? - Today, you are getting the promotion that you so richly deserve. These are the keys to the mobile police unit. You start Monday. - Why-why-why thank you, sir. I have no idea what to say but thank you, sir. - Sergio, you are braver than you think you are and much stronger than you seem but we've got to work on those social skills of yours, you know? - Yes, sir, that is correct, sir. - Now I don't usually do this but this is a special occasion.
