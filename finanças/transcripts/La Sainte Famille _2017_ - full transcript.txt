First, he tried to make him fall out of pride, doubting his divine nature. So, he challenged him. "If you are indeed the son of God, "order this stone to become bread". Christ answered that man should not live on bread alone, showing the Devil the vanity of his proposal. The Devil persisted. He said to Christ, "I will give you glory "and all the kingdoms, if you bow down at my feet." Once again, Christ refused, citing the Scriptures. We are men and women made in the image of God. We have the power to resist temptation. Not out of pride, but because God has endowed us with free will. If we can do evil, we can also refuse evil. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Clovis, Charlemagne, Saint Louis and Joan d'Arc laid the foundations for the Church of France. So many milestones in history. Not to mention the separation of Church and State in 1905. Despite the difficulties, growing individualism and materialism, we are still standing, alive. Preparing for World Youth Day gives meaning to our traditions. The eldest daughter of Church holds her place in modernity. And you, youngsters, are in the front row. - Here. - Thanks. Have a nice day. Hello. For Sandrine. I'm sorry. Here. Thank you. What was your name? Alright? - Am I late? - Not at all. You've grown up! Hello, Charles. - OK, sister? - Yes, how are you? - Hello, Charles. - Excellency. - How are you? - She's here. I was waiting for you, Mom. I have a problem, nothing serious. I'd like to show you something. Surprise! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear mother Happy birthday to you Thank you for your financial help. Financing WYD is no easy task. Charles knows how hard it can be. The crisis affects him, too. I better go or they'll end up fighting. I have a meeting at the bishop's office. I don't renew temps. I want some room for maneuver. How many temps? At least 200. Is the situation that bad? It'll be fine by December. If that happens, why fire people? Charles, there are no miracles in pharmacy. No one will get fired. I won't be renewing temp contracts. The weakest always pay for the strongest. The Pope has commented on this. - Guy! - Charles... Mom! He has a driver and he fires people! Try to understand. Going to Mass is not enough. God doesn't approve. You're not God, Charles. Look who's here. Federico! My obnoxious Franciscan. - What happened to you? - It's a long story. - I see you're doing better. - Yes. Your doctor is good. Federico arrived this morning. He's got a bad wound. - Bye, Madeleine. - Goodbye. How long are you staying? Eight months. No, rest assured. I'm leaving next week. I'm exhausted, Madeleine. I need to rest. Thanks for everything. - I love him. - I hate him. He should've called. It seems he had to bring forward his trip. You lied to your son. God doesn't like that. - Bye, Mom. - Goodbye, honey. See you soon, brother. Take care of yourself. Come on, Mom. Tell me. Our doctor says his injury wasn't an accident. - He was probably shot. - Oh, God! - Careful, son. That's blasphemy. - I'm sorry. I hate playing this role. You have long served the Church, but the bishop is unwavering. It's over. The Holy Father has set the limit. Breaking your vows cannot be tolerated. Please, forgive me. I don't have that power. Pray, Étienne, and repent. Two believers testified against you. We don't want a new scandal. You're going to retire. An institution house will accommodate you. Come on, make your arrangements. Who did this? Some bastard. It arrived in the bishopric with an anonymous letter. You've lived with her for 10 years? I knew it was a sin, Charles. But it's a love story. You can't fight it. The Church has rules! When we become priests, we must respect them. It's non-negotiable. Celibacy is part of the contract, part of the mystery of faith. No one can deviate from it. I want to confess, Charles. "Who carries the word of God? "Communities and individuals. "Since they can't bear the load of this word, "they designate another to carry it. "And who does Christ appoint to carry that word?" My friend the Bishop of Havana sent me this. I quit smoking. It's caviar, Charles. A luxurious sin. What would the Church councillors say if they saw us smoking this? OK, fine. How is your friend Federico doing? He's doing very well. I doubt it. First, he's a Franciscan, and second, he's a leftist. I don't like either. Have you been to his lectures? Not yet. But I've heard nice things. My mom loves him. I know. Do you know the priest joke? There are three great mysteries in the clergy: one, the number of women's congregations, two, the real wealth of a mendicant order, like that of the Franciscans, and three, the number of ulterior motives of a Jesuit. Tell me about the Étienne case. It's hard for him, Father. But he repents nonetheless. We went to seminary together. But we decided to be implacable. I know. He was very upset. A long time ago, when a scandal broke out, priests were sent to the colonies. But the Holy Father is intransigent, and he is right. - Is my speech finished? - Almost. What about my note on WYD? One second. Thank you. You can... Stupid habit. In Brazil, the large properties, called latifundia, date from the colonial days. Nothing has changed. Presently, 1% of landowners own 54% of the farmland. Huge estates you can only visit completely by plane. In contrast, there are 12 million agricultural workers working for meager wages. Your bishop has probably warned you. He's worried. He's a good man, but he won't support the landless movement. He can ban your lectures. Yes. No reason to complain. Is your schedule busy? I'm going to Arras, Tourcoing, Boulogne, and Paris for 8 days. I'll stop by before I leave. Do you have a financial goal for your tour? 50,000 euros. What're you gonna do with it? You're being mysterious. You don't trust me? I'm gonna buy guns. Guns? Three assaults in the last months. Four dead and seven wounded, including your servant. We can't keep turning the other cheek. Big landlords send killers. We will defend ourselves. Guns... Are you sure it's your job to do that? If we give up on the poor farmers, the Church will be rejected. Yes, Mom. How are you? I'm with Federico. OK, I'll drop by. I love you. The Franciscan says he loves you too. Hello, Sister. Thank you. LIBRARY OF JERUSALEM Hello, Sister. - Claire, isn't it? - Yes. Can you help me? My mother donated a big pack of books for the tombola, but she left a 17th century Bible inside of it by mistake. - Everything's in the back. - Great. It means a lot to her, so... No, it's not that one. Yes. This is it. I'm sorry. Charles, tell us what decision the bishop made regarding the organization of WYD. We have to finance the plane, or we'll leave people in the field. Charles? What? No. I'm sorry, I... I'm in charge of the negotiations with the charter companies, and... Excuse me. I'll call an ambulance. No, no ambulance, please. No ambulance. I'm gonna tell you the truth. The bishop offered me a cigar. Yes. I quit smoking, and it messed me up. I'm gonna take a shower, and tomorrow I'll be fine. Rich family, right arm of the bishop, cigar... It wouldn't happen in my parish. You're being unfair. Charles is talented, fraternal, attentive. He's a prince of the Church. There's a flood in the church, so the firemen arrive and ask the abbot to get out. He refuses, saying God will provide. The water rises. The firemen ask the abbot to get in the lifeboat. He refuses again, saying God will provide. Eventually, the abbot has to hold on to the bell tower. The firemen come back and say, "Please, you're going to drown! "This is the third time we come". He says, "No. God will provide". He drowns. He gets up there, and tells God, "I don't understand. I was a fervent servant, "and you didn't save me". And so God says, "What? I sent you the rescue squad!" I must absolutely see you tonight. Charles Thank you. Come in. God made us with our strengths and weaknesses. Every day he puts us to the test. No one is immune from error. There'll be more joy in Heaven for one sinner who repents, than for the righteous who persevere. It's a form of repentance. The morning-after pill. The Church is against it. - God doesn't approve. - I know. But it's not an abortion. In extreme cases, it's... Father, I have sinned. I'm in love with a young woman. Have you challenged your chastity? Let me ask again. Did you break your vow of celibacy? Kind of, Father. "Kind of" doesn't exist. Have you sinned in deed, yes or no? - My schedule? - It's in there, Father. Your passport and boarding pass. In the file, I put the speech for the curia and a report on the preparations for WYD. I don't know what I'd do without you. You do a good job. You've been looking tired, Charles, since you started smoking cigars. God will forgive us even lung cancer. Thank you, Tom. You should take a few days off. Later, Father. After WYD. We need to find money. Planes cost a fortune. Passengers to Rome, please report to the boarding area. You have been appointed by the WYD Organizing Committee as one of its spokespersons. Coming from a very pious family, you are a Jesuit, you work with Bishop Lombard, and you just published a remarkable book, Reflections on the Church of France. You could say you're one of the Church's men of tomorrow. That's flattering, but give it a rest. I am only a servant of God. Tell us about how WYD is being prepared. So, at a regional level, the teams have gathered 3,000 participants, i.e. 10 charters. And it's not over. But we don't have money, and we're looking for solutions. Our young people are great. They've come together to raise money. Are you ready to get involved in Father Charles' project? They'd be welcome. Great. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Keep it up. - Goodbye. Bye, thank you. I listened to you on the radio. It was very good. Claire. Thank you. I want to see you. In two days? Charles I am willing to see you, just not here. Claire. I'm gonna miss you. I heard you on the radio. You don't need anyone. Just work. That's all. I didn't ask for it. The organizing committee appointed me. I'm not sure we should give in to the media circus. On the radio, you spoke to thousands of people and spread the word of God. The Church can't snub the media. In my camp, we set up a small radio station. My bishop's glad you're leaving. "Leftism is a dreadful perversion of the gospel, Charles". You might think the same way in a few years. If I listened to myself, I'd be like you. - What's the matter? - I'm doing poorly. And I'm doing great. Elaborate. I don't want to go into details. Don't tell me you're going through something wonderful, but not exactly authorized? I knew you'd understand. We live with thousands of farmers. Accidents happen. Sometimes, God puts me to the test. But you... You can't do things that jeopardize your priestly integrity. You have too many responsibilities. Chastity is hard, but you have to hold on. What are you gonna do? Honestly? I have no idea. When I have a problem, I isolate myself and fast. And God speaks to me. "Keep my soul in peace, near you, my God. "My Lord... "I don't have a proud heart nor an ambitious eye. "I do not pursue great plans or wonders that go beyond me. "No. "But I hold my soul even and silent. "My soul is in me like a child, "a small child against his mother. "Wait for the Lord, Israel, "now and forever". He's convincing, educational. Charles' way of doing things revitalize the Church. He's a great mentor. But he has a lot on his shoulders. So much the better. He gets lumbered with hassle. - Here. - Thank you. He must face adversity. Faith is his armor. Dear Lord, bless this meal. Amen. A great career is impossible otherwise. What I like about you is, you don't hide his ambitions for him. He's the best of his generation, don't you think? Don't force the pace. - The competition is fierce. - Yes. But with your help and that of the Lord, he will prevail. I hope to see you again on my next trip. Just don't get yourself killed. You don't need that to become a saint. Wait. For your charities. Thank you. What would you like to do? Movies. - I have to put on my glasses. - No, don't do that! Yes, a real Tour de France runner. Wonderful. This new molecule has undeniable results in prostate cancer. Demand is strong. Investment funds are willing to partner with us. This is the fruit of 5 years of work. And keep in mind - even you, Charles - that the production line is 100% automatic. The technicians will just check that there are no incidents. Robotics is cutting jobs. That's how it is. Thank you. Impressive. And very reassuring. If I get prostate cancer, I'll try your medicine. Your dear son never fails to speak nonsense. I don't have one dear son, I have two sons that I love. Let's have a drink. Say, Mom, when's Clémence coming back? In two more weeks, probably. I don't want her to give birth on a plane. How is she doing? That's something I'd like to know. Me too. I think about you, too. I miss you. The Holy Father elevated him to the rank of cardinal. We had left him as bishop, he was our Bishop Lombard, and now he's Cardinal Lombard. From now on, he will be wearing the ribbon, the red square hat and the blue sapphire ring. We will call him Eminence. Working like others and with others by his side, I am aware of his generosity in the service of God, the love that he gives to all his collaborators and the joy he instills in the faithful. The Church of France has a new cardinal who honors our diocese. Did you keep on smoking while I was out? Moderately. Right reverend lord Cardinal of the Holy Church. What's wrong with you? "Eminence" will do. But you're a cardinal now! I won't change and you should do the same. Thank you for what you did. The WYD director told me you did a brilliant job on the radio. Now come drink to my election. It seems the mobilization is good. We never had this many sign-ups. Our kids are wonderful. The Holy Father? I met him briefly. I'll meet him again at the next trip. He is calm and nice, and he works really hard. This will be of no use, but.... my son is not doing that well. Exactly my thoughts. Aren't there are more serious things to worry about? Please, I need a break. Only 300 m to go. One last effort and we'll stop. - Where? - Over there. Alright! - Enjoy... - Your meal! - Thank you... - You too! Alright, let's eat! We did at least 12 or 13 kilometers. Four, Father. - Four? - Yes. Four for you, ten for me. Julien, Maryse, tell me where you're at. In Lille, 107,000. We're gonna need buses to the airport, and the money's hard to find. That's true. And you? I got 60,000 from companies. It's not much. I think we need to take the initiative. Good idea. In Roubaix? We're reaching our goal. People are rallying. You should do a few more radio programs, Father. And TV shows. After your last one, we enrolled 300 more kids. France 3 has invited me. We'll see. How do we go home? - Running, Father. - No! You're gonna kill me. We serve the Lord. Alright, double time! The first to pass me, wins. You've been novices for a year, and your behavior is exemplary. In 3 months, if you want and I agree, you will take the veil of the sisters of Mary. You have a job outside and that's good, because you are in society and you exercise your faith in it. But I repeat, entering the Church at your age and in our order is a very tough decision. Charles, I really need your editorial. Yes. OK, I got it. Thanks, Emmanuel. The event for Catholics and young French people is the preparation of World Youth Day. Pope Francis will preside over the meeting of millions of young people. Youth is the strength of the Church. Ombline, where're you at? Each group chooses its own watchword. We have decided to focus our banners on equal pay and the Pope's welcome, of course. What about you? We have a banner on the fight against racism and the dialogue between religions. We thought we'd do a concert to donate the profits so we can have money. A concert of what? A rock concert. Let's go for a walk. - It's about Charles. - Go on. I told my friends in the Vatican about him. Some bishops know him. He has his fair share of friends and enemies. That's a good sign. Also, I think that within a year or two, he may be required to work at the curia. If he passes the exam, I assure you that he could become the youngest bishop in France. What do I have to do? Nothing. Do not interfere. WYD promises to be a success. He is one of the four organizers and spokespersons. He'll meet the Pope. And, who knows, it might be the beginning of a story. You see, things are not simple. Many believers have rallied against same-sex marriage, and new generations are coming to consciousness. The young people who will take part in WYD, are backing the concepts of love, fidelity, refusal of contraception, observance of celibacy. It'll be hard to stand up against this generation. In Rome, the conservative trend is still very active. If we do not deal with dogmas, we will hand our faithful to all kinds of sects. I like to hear you talk like that, Eminence. Claire? - Hello? - Yes. - How are you? - OK. - Were you busy? - No, I fell asleep. - What're you doing? - Writing a speech. I want to see you. When? It was fantastic. I like it seeing you like that. I think of you, too. Sleep tight. Is he cute? Who do you mean? The one who sleeps tight. Your love. You smoke now? To each their own. So? I bet he's handsome. - Not one word. - No. Who do you think I am? Where's John? He stayed in New York. - He'll be back for the delivery? - No. He won't come back. Does he have a new girlfriend? I won't say any more. - I said something stupid. - I will have to agree. I can't take it. I can't take it, Mom. It's OK, honey. In these cases, men are of little use. Assuming that, in general, they serve some purpose. - Queen mother's in good shape. - Yes. So Clémence and John broke up? Looks like it. - What do you think? - I don't know. I've never been in that situation. Right, see you later. How's family? Pretty good. Are you and Claire getting along? Yes. And no. When she's here, it's perfect... but she's often away. She works quite a lot, doesn't she? She doesn't just work. She goes out, too. Sister Joséphine, would you please get us some fresh bread? Of course, Mother. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Sit down. Where does she go? With whom? I don't know. A relative? Maybe. Probably. Would you tell me if there was a problem? We have nothing to hide. I don't know, Mother. Mrs. de Waquin, I would like to see you regarding a photo... My church has no style, but it has a soul. The faithful are numerous. Half the youngsters are unemployed. Vulnerability and poverty is the rule. In fact, raising money for WYD hasn't been easy. A sponsor would be welcome. All the photos have been deleted. 20,000. There's work to be done. I really admire your son. He's talented. And I'm even a bit jealous of him. There's room for everyone. I'm not worried about you. And Charles likes you a lot. He's lucky to have a mother like you. I want you to promise me you'll never say anything against him. You have my word. Another 20,000. My contribution to the parish tithes. In short, this isn't bribery by any means. How could you think that of me? Tom, I need your help. - Our Charles is doing stupid things. - I understand, madam. Clémence will give birth next week. She'll stay with us, and then she'll live here. We'll have to find a new place. I have no idea. But... Hiding... I know. After WYD... Nothing, Charles. I ask for nothing. You smoke too much. You're a wreck. That's what the Cardinal says. I have a meeting. Charles. Charles, please. Charles! Charles. Tom! Thank you. - What a surprise. - Indeed. Hurry, or the baby will be born before we get there. Boy or girl? Doesn't matter. Clémence and I would like a girl. Her husband? He won't come. They're getting a divorce. That was fast. Clemence doesn't want to hear about him anymore. - He used to beat her. - What? He beat her? He looked so nice. A Protestant. There are many houses in the House of the Lord. It happens even in our family. Everything happens in this family. You're leaving tomorrow. I called Sophie. The house is ready. - But, Mom... - No. You're starting to piss me off. You go and have some rest. The Cardinal agrees with me. But, Mom... I won't discuss it. It's final. OK, I'll go. - Tom will drive you to the station. - No, thanks. Tom will drive you to the station. You're in a bad mood. God also grants me that right. Hello? Claire? How are you? Terrific. On my bed, at night, I searched for the one my heart loves. You stole my heart with one of your looks. I was asleep, but my heart was awake. I knocked on your door. "Let me in, sister, "friend, dove of mine. "Put me like a seal on your heart, "for love is as strong as death, "and its fierceness is fire, "a flame of the Everlasting". I've never been with anyone but you. Wait... Sorry. It's the Cardinal. Yes, Father. It's not exactly sunny. No, I haven't tried to swim. No, I'm alone. OK, I'll be at home. Very well, Father. Thank you, bye. Concretely, Father, where are you at with WYD? From Russia, Turkey, London, millions of young people are expected. This, of course, requires substantial logistics to finance tickets, acommodation and food for WYD participants. In terms of mobilization, has France done a good job? The Pope will be proud. There's been a rise in the number of youth who are joining WYD. What would you tell those thousands of young people about contraception, marriage... The Church doesn't usually lower itself to win over hearts and minds. Youth don't need demagoguery. They are aware of the importance of fidelity in marriage to build a family in faith. You're not exactly modern for a young Jesuit. The message of Christ is a very modern message. He's 2,000, after all. Modernity, madam, is the ability to make traditions and dogmas live. Jesuits are loyal soldiers of the Church. I get it, it wasn't good. I couldn't praise the unbreakable bonds of marriage. Yeah, me too. Hello. One cognac, please. Thank you. What? You want my picture? Wasn't it you on TV? Yes. What the hell do you care? Thank you. What would I be without you Who came to meet me? What would I be without you But a sleeping heart? An hour that stopped At the dial of the watch? What would I be without you, But a stuttering? You who made the life of children spring forth in us on the day of our baptism. Blessed be You, Lord! You who spread your love in our hearts to make us free and let us taste the peace of your Kingdom. Blessed be you, Lord! Now bless this water where he will be reborn to live in eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. The Church of God welcomes you with great joy. In His name, I mark you with the cross, the sign of Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen. Would you like some? Would you like some Champagne? Yes? There you go. - Champagne? - No, thank you, Clémence. Mom? Champagne? No, I'm fine. Cognac? Thank you, my dear Guy. Are you OK? - What about you? - I'm good. You've made a decision? - Is it final? - Yes. - You know I'm here for you. - Yes. What about you? Did you get some rest? The cold did me good. I walked... I've been trying to see you two for a month. It's about the factory. Clémence agreed to it. I had no choice. Well? Do what you think is right. Decisions in this family are unanimously taken. We're losing money. Generic drugs don't pay. I checked the figures. The group's fine. - I can't condone the layoffs. - No one's being laid off. Dad would've never done that. We can't start acting like everyone else. But do as you please. He's right. Well? As usual. "No, but do as you please". He's a pain. And you're a jerk! If Charles refuses, we don't do it. Take care of the guests. Mom! The day Charles decides to jump out the window, we all will. Stop it, Guy. You're so dramatic. How are you, Father Étienne? Nothing to say, I'm bored to death. Does your family visit you? I have an older sister. I read, I pray. I watch stupid series on TV. By the way, I saw you. You speak quite clearly. Thank you. Does the Cardinal send you? No, I'm here on my own free will. I'd like to ask you a question. Go ahead. You don't have to answer. When you were a priest, in your mind, how did you reconcile your love story and your vows? Like you reconcile the worst and the best. It was like two parallels. Two different, separate worlds. There was the world of God. I'd do my job, and I think I did it right. The parishioners liked me. And then, the other world. The world of love and desire. A dreadful force I couldn't resist. Will that do? It's enlightening. Let's walk. Yes. I heard the baptism of little Benoît was beautiful. New arrivals in the Church are a unique moment. Like a handover. Do you think it's fair that we can't have children? Here we are about thirty priests, all retired, waiting for death. Some think that celibacy runs contrary to Gospel. For the first time in centuries, we have a Jesuit pope, a Jesuit cardinal, a future Jesuit bishop. You truly are the soldiers of the Church. Disciplined... Too disciplined. But you I like you. Thanks for the chocolates. Thank you. Everything I loved, everything I built is falling apart. Some water? This can only do you good. What he did was stupid, but it's not yet dramatic. First, no one knows, second, it has to stop, and third, it's already happened. You can't defend the indefensible. The vow of chastity cannot be disputed. Whoever practices sin is a slave of sin. I appreciate you reminding me of the rule. "Where sin abounds, grace abounds even more". Saint Paul. Your investing in Charles has turned into a heavy weight on his shoulders. Charles this, Charles that. You decided he'd be a pope as soon as he was born. And you kind of forgot that he was a man. A young man full of energy, full of blood. I love him like he's my own son. He shouldn't have done that. People always expect the best of us Jesuits, but man is weak. And that girl is charming. You can't justify... I'm trying to understand and find a solution. Here's what we're gonna do. First, Madeleine, you stay out of it. Not one word to Charles. I'll handle this. Second, take care of the girl. But beware of acting like an abusive mother. Be tactful. It's probably a true love story. All in all, Jacques, you think I'm a fool. If I did, people would know, and I wouldn't see you at 10 pm. We gotta get him out of this mess. Eminence! I didn't expect you. Of course. I didn't tell anyone. Sit down. Rome needs a report on the refugees. I remember you have a leftist and Franciscan friend - Federico. - He's in Brazil. - Don't interrupt me. It's a perfect opportunity for you to write a report for Rome. Your friend is not in Brazil. He's in a camp near the coast. You're going to see him and call him to order. Of course, Father. - As soon as I finish... - No, right now. Wait, I've been working 24/7 on WYD. 24/7? I highly doubt it. O'Neil will stand in. He's tough. He'll do the job. He has the right to be in the spotlight, too. Let me finish... This isn't a debate, it's an order! Should I remind you of your vow of obedience? Listen to me, Charles. I want a serious report, not some whiny stuff. An observation. The Cardinal knows. He told you? He implied it. He's sending me away. He's right. He's right, Charles. It'll be an opportunity to think. Think about what? I love you. I love you too. People are generally grouped by affinity, sex, age and nationality. And gradually, life gets organized. The restaurant, run by two young Afghans. That's where we store clothes, blankets and all that stuff. All right? Did you settle in? I'll see you later. These are meeting spaces. We try to get people together around activities. Back there are the women and children areas. They're apart. We did it intentionally for privacy reasons. And that's the church. Thank you. See you later. Why are you here, Federico? You said you were going to Brazil! Am I allowed to speak? A friend of mine asked me to come over. When I saw this, I decided to stay. You could've called. To cause you trouble. You would've told your Cardinal. You think he doesn't know? - Your behavior... - What with it? Feeling better? Charles. There are many children and teens alone. The parents? Dead or in their home country. They send their children so they can go to England. They have family there. Look... The official figures are not accurate. There's twice as much or more. They have nothing, not even a decent shower. It's a disaster. The locals have been amazing. They help and bring food. Many of them are Catholics. We must support them. You're right. It is a disaster. But the Church can only do so much. I'm not the Church, I'm Federico. You're a pain! You want to be a saint? Federico. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I'm gonna stay. OK. Olivier, can you bring a mattress for tonight? No problem. Thanks. You don't get it. I want to stay as long as it takes. Then, I'll make the report. Very well. Don't be afraid. This is not a failure. What you have learned will be useful. And you'll serve God in society. We'll never forget you. This happens every night. Do any of them manage to pass? Of course. Despite the police, some make it to England. Nothing can stop the poor. Police! There are casualties often. And smugglers who make money out of poverty. The authorities will shut down the camp. It'll resurge somewhere else. You have reached Claire. Please, leave a message. Thank you. Hi, Claire, it's Charles. Where do I start? I joined Federico in a refugee camp. It's quite tough. But it makes you think. I've been thinking about you. All the time. I would've loved to hear your voice. I love you. - Need help? - Yes. - Enjoy. - Thank you. The Cardinal would love to see you with a leftist Franciscan. I don't answer to provocation. This is Jules de Waquin, the founder. He was a pharmacist who made drugs with little success. His son, Hervé. He founded the Saint Francis of Assisi hospital. Our great-grandfather, François. He settled in Roubaix and opened the first modern lab that manufactured medicines. François developed the company, financed Catholic schools and then moved to Lille. And this is Edmond, the father of Marc, my husband. He was one of the first Resistants in the region. He was deported, then elected congressman after the Liberation. That's when he and my husband Marc set up the laboratories that carry our name. I am neither a bigot nor a possessive mother who thinks about her son all day, although I do think about him. Have a seat. I have three children, but Charles is special. When he told me he wanted to answer God's call, I did all I could to deter him. But the truth is apparent: he has faith and he is talented. Very talented. Do you understand? Of course, madam, and I agree with you. I met a young lady who was in love with a priest. A sincere love. They lived together in total secrecy, and one day, she got pregnant. Life became unbearable for them. The priest lost his mind and committed suicide. If you can't separate, be aware that, in a few years, Charles will hate you for forcing him into this situation. Madam, with Charles, I discovered love. I don't love a priest, I love a man. A wonderful man. I have quit the Church. I won't be a nun. I respect your decision, but I have to protect my son. Your love must be strong enough to keep you away. Leave town, leave the region. I can help you. We'll see. Claire, wait. You think you can buy everybody? I really am a fool. I want to confess. No, no. I need to, Federico. I know what you're gonna tell me. There's no answer. The decision is up to you. Is she a good person? She's a novice. Oh, shit! That's too much. Here. There will be more joy in heaven for one sinner who repents than for 99 righteous who persevere. The Gospel doesn't have all answers. I know you will find the way. You'll be OK. Goodnight. - Have a good rest. - You too. "Charles, I'm leaving the convent. "I won't take the veil. "Keeping up would be madness. "You have to stay in the Church. "You must pursue your mission and live your faith. "I'm going back to school. "Keep your head, even if it's hard. "Walk to your destiny". Charles. Claire. What are you doing? It was a mistake. Look at me, Claire. Look at me. I want to marry you. I want to have kids, I want to live with you. I can't, Charles. - I don't want to. - You do. My career is not an aim in itself. I love you. I love you too. But I'm strong enough to break up. I'm ready to leave if I have to. No, I refuse. - Calm down. - I refuse! Calm down. You must keep going. You don't get divorced from God. His love will guide you. I'll write to you. I'm going to be strong for both of us. - You're not hungry? - It's rabbit, Eminence. I forgot you hated rabbit. - Anything else? - No, thanks. Your report is interesting. But it seems to be missing a few paragraphs. Not one criticism. Not one negative remark. Federico is doing an amazing job. I'd never seen such strong bonds. They live the message of Christ. Si je te comprends bien, So, we should all go live there. The fact that refugees in France are so ill-treated speaks volumes about the times. Perhaps. - But France faces so many problems. - So many unused resources. Your friend Federico has made you dizzy. Sister Cécile. Your report will be used at the conference. Let's have a toast. To your return... and your departure. Father... You don't want me back? The Secretariat of the Holy Father sent me a message. He wants a Frenchman on his WYD team The other cardinals and I agreed on a name: Charles de Waquin. Praise be to the Lord. But, Eminence, I will never live up to it. Please, don't be prissy. You will learn. People will see you, get to know you. In 4 years, if you do what you have to do, God willing, you'll become bishop. I bet my life on it. Have a drink. To tell you the truth, I'm gonna miss you. No one can match you. May God help me. I will pray for you. I don't have any concerns. You're a prince of the Church. Four years later, Charles became bishop. There is a pleasure in forgiveness that cannot be found in revenge. God advises us to be gentle and peaceful with all, to be benevolent towards all and to wish them well. He is the good, He is the generous. He gives everything and more to the one who purified his being to the point of seeing the good, the one who forgives. Then, everyone will enjoy this good. - The body of Christ. - Amen. The body of Christ. - The body of Christ. - Amen. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Subtitles: ECLAIR
