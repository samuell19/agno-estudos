LUMBERJACK 1944 Heih! Butt? Butt, what happened? What happened? It's Julie! What happened to Julie? She came out a little strange some time ago and left this written. My poor girl! Waiting for a failed man. I am not so worried about it. There are only two places she may have gone. Partially Joe and Jacy s the Piece. Jimmy, stay over there in the passage to see if there's anything new. Okay, Hoppy. But, don't tell anyone about it. No word on that, Hoppy. Butt! Butt! Where are you? Ah, stop screaming at your whims! You take care of that part anyway, And keep it quiet! Stay tuned! - Let's go! - Wait! - Let's go fast! - I will go. Come, Madam! Are you trying to kidnap me? Kidnap? You think? I will go! Let me go! - Get up there! - I will go. So settle down and stay here! You think I have no more sense. I just said I will. Help me up. Have no idea. Oh, California! Priest! Priest! I... I'm out of breath. It may be that Julie is getting married right now. Stop! If you stop. Priest! I'm happy to see you. I was waiting for you too. We are late. Are we there on time? I say that love is always in a hurry. Well but if you want you can see the end of the ceremony. No, no! That way It wouldn't be worth it. No, no, not California. You don't want to lose. It is a wonderful institution. But you don't know what you're doing! She turned her back on our love. No, no, no! Everything was for love. Marriage, California is a great endowment, and the bride appears to be a sensible woman. But she is very impulsive. California is right. This will never work. Oh yes, it will. California, you accept this woman. to be your wife forever and ever? I accept. Huh? Wait! Wait a moment! We are here to prevent a wedding, not to make it. Well, continue with the ceremony, Father. What? California would accept this woman. You accept? California, come back here, now! In between. Well, it looks like I'm a little late. Well, Hoppy this is my husband. Ben Jordan. How are you? Julie told me a lot about you, Mr. Cassidy. I hope it wasn't too bad. It was not. She is very calm, but you seem to be in a delicate situation, right? I think I can. Son, the marriage documents, all signed and sealed. - Thank you sir. - Take good care of them, dear? Make sure, I will. Julie, is there anything about this case, between you and your father that you don't know? I know. There's something I didn't say, Hoppy. - Can you excuse us, Ben? - Sure, I'll walk a little. One thing you don't know. Something I couldn't tell Dad. We need help, Hoppy. We desperately need it. See, when I met... Ben! Ben! You killed! - Butt, you did... - I don't even know, who shot it. I was just... trying to stop you from being... Keep it here. Where did the shot that hit Ben's head come from? Official district tax collector Pinerock, Cahf. Delinquent for five years. If you don't pay by June 1st, your property will be sold at a public auction. Hi, Joe! We found this message in our land, Mr. Keefer. What do they mean? Well, Ben Jordan told me that his fights, were invading his property. What fights? Do you have any objection? You know that we've changed. Ah, I'm afraid they haven't changed that much. This is a nice message. So Ben, are you back from the grave? It’s hard to say, but those are your orders, and I will not go against them. Ben Jordan said that, afraid someone would kill him. We will avoid judgments. Depending on what happened to Ben Jordan, you guys will be held responsible. You better be careful. More problems with fights? Yes, but this is already under control. I wish you hadn't come here now, Mr. Familic. If I want to talk about that railway, it was something I wanted to leave for later Well. But the truth is that Ben Jordan hasn't paid taxes for a long time. Yes, I already warned you about that. Alert? So he's already warned. Jordan will never come here with the money. Ah, that's why you look so peaceful. It is expensive, but relative. Come here! This is the block of land that will pass through the road. Jordan was a fool not to have started cutting it in a long time. Have you ever thought about selling them for tax prices, and bet them without price. And the other lands? Ben, left it to the Jordans. Nobody knows that. I don't know how they got there. Look, Julie's wedding is her responsibility. See, the only thing she can do is go to Pinerock. Yes. Look out for her on the way, Hoppy. That's the biggest reason Dad. I asked him to find the man responsible for Ben's death. But if I surrounded the killer, would I be able to recognize him? Yes, definitely. - I'll wait at the entrance, Hoppy. - Right. - Will you come with us? - Yes. - Not this one. No, put it up there and put it in the middle. You mean right there, for when the carriage jolts. But, this is total nonsense. Do not argue! I do not answer for what will happen anyway. What can happen or not? What's not, what's not? It doesn't interest you. Change the subject! Ah, I changed my Saturday night. Carlson, that's all! Where do you think you're going? The Europe? I'm going to town to protect Julie from those woodcutters. Wood cutters! Whatever the way of speaking. I will put them in their place. Ah, I think this road is full of holes. No, each one will end them with their own branch, and some women are skilled. I’m sorry I can’t go on their wagon, but we need to get to Pinerock, before the tax is paid, on June 1st. I know that. Hoppy good luck. Thanks. See you later, Dad. See you later, Julie. Settle down! Good... I'm back. Are the Jordans handling the case? They are! What about the murder? They think it was an accident. But, what a pity. And I have some news that you will appreciate. Jordan was murdered earlier than it would be for me. - Right there? - Yes. Because of his suitcase. She is coming to see you too. Just a few miles behind me. But why didn't you come here before. I had to stop to follow them before I got here. You're going to have to get back on the road and do what I say. The auction will start in an hour. Jordan's wife is going to have to be stopped from getting here. Right now she is protected. She is escorted by three men. The name of one of them is Cassidy. He's responsible for the deaths of many men around here. I think it will have to conform. This is included in the contract and the money. Well I do not know. Lady Jordan is escorted by one of the feared men in the region, but guided by that other gentleman. She will be too late. But you told me, California, that the road had no holes. Well, you know what that road is like. Settle down and restrain yourself until then. I had forgotten to warn you. Dont care. Just keep driving. I know this road well. And all lined with trees. This is obvious. Do not doubt me. Hey, California! Where are you going California? This is the road to Pinerock! No, is that it, Hoppy? I think it is wrong. Look at that sign. Do not understand. Those plates were changed. How do you also have to change. I know that California knows this region. He said the road to California had no hole. Now he says the plates have been changed. I put those signs twenty years ago, with my own hands. I wouldn't forget this place in a million years. Right here I met a lady. Not you... Look up there! Like no other... homesick girl. What I, what I know... oh my tooth, oh my teeth! I would marry her before anything. IT IS? And why didn't you get married? She must know. Let's go! We have no time to lose! California is right. This card has been replaced. See you. I am always right. Oh yes. Well, we have to go ahead. Will I hear five thousand and fifty, through these valuable lands? I have five thousand. Will I complete with fifty? I have five thousand. Will I hear fifty? Fifty! Five thousand and fifty! Will I hear seventy-five? Five thousand and fifty. Will I hear seventy-five? Five thousand and seventy-five I have. Will I hear six thousand? Five and seventy-five for now. Will I hear six thousand? For five and seventy-five, one... For five and seventy-five... two... They Agree? So come on! Sold! Five thousand and seventy-five! An excellent piece of land. the best among mountains and mountains. Don't do the same. Let's keep taxes up to date. A portion worth eleven thousand two hundred, per square meter. - I heard? - Eleven thousand and five! Eleven thousand and five, I have! Eleven-six! Did I hear seven? Twelve thousand! I have twelve thousand. Did I hear twelve thousand and five? I heard twelve thousand and three. Did I hear twelve thousand and three? Listen, gentlemen. Even thirteen thousand to deliver. Well, the Jordans haven't paid taxes in five years and a little more. Twelve thousand and then some! Are they all in agreement? Hit the hammer! Twelve thousand, I give you one! Twelve thousand, I'll give you two! Twelve thousand I give you... Just a moment! - You can't sell this land! - Why not? Mrs. Jordan, wants to pay taxes. - It's too late! - I think not. How do you think this is cool? What does that mean? Six of the eleven. The property will not only go to public auction, if taxes are paid, at least a good percentage. I did not know that! You have to end this auction as you make the effort. Here is the tax money. He's the collector! Don't keep pushing? I was just trying to get through, that's all. You know what, you're too big! Wait a minute... Joe? Is that you? Big Joe Williams! Carl? Why haven't I seen you since that important day? How have you been through all these years? Working at the Bar 20 farm, as usual. Let's see the rest of the auction. Oh yes? But Joe, what do you know... Well, tell me where is that old girl, who did I meet? Ah, she is right there, with my wife. - She is? - Tell me when she sees you... Well well well. You seem to be a sensible young woman. Why pay for the land, the sale price? Mrs. Jordan, she didn't sell any property, she has no interest in that. We know it hasn't sold yet. But we can offer you proposals. Take her to the office, Mr Familic. - But, Julie... - It doesn't matter, Hoppy. You wait for me, after seeing them. Do you remember Carl? Oh, sure, California. Ah, Whitan my girl, I am very happy to see you. It seems that the years have not passed, does it? Say, um... where's Littlemanny? There she is, Carl. She can't be that fat woman! It's herself! Is that Manny? Go over there and see her, California. - No, I think it's better... - No, let's go! I already went... I almost... Here's the receipt, Mr. Cassidy. How do you know my name? Well, I heard when Mrs. Jordan called you... And, Ms. Jordan's business with Mr. Familic, is personal. Mine are too! Hey! Happy to see you again. California! Wait a minute. Manny, you're in the prime of your health! - And can you measure me? - Well, uh, of course. All around. Both sides? Of course! Don't you think I'm growing up? Yes! This one is for, uh, Manny, I’ve never seen it this big. But it's ok. I well... I'll be going. You're without a key, aren't you? Yeah, it's inside. The girl is inside and so is Cassidy - But I don't know... - Before Sheriff Miles, realize what happened to the boy, get busy and get in trouble. Cause fights around the region. That's right. Since what you did is not advantageous, why not consider the law itself? - I? - Yes. Well, if you change your mind, you already have a buyer. Mrs. Jordan knows nothing about the timber business. Hoppy, please! I warn you that you will have to start production immediately. You will be surprised, as it is the largest land in the mountains. Julie, it’s not better to change your mind, and accept the Lord's offer, Familic? I do not know. I do not know what to do! Say no' Look at this! These documents will help everyone to make your decisions. They were in your husband's suitcase. But her husband was unfortunately not taking good care of his land. He hadn't produced in years. We are acting within the law. This land is pure. That was his order I believe that they didn't know what to do with that wood. But there was so much to do! Julie, could you look out that window Please! Those people are depending on your decision. They will wait... for a month. - One month? - California, goodbye! I would like to talk to Mrs. Jordan, in particular, please! It's ok. Julie, don't you see what that means? It's no use, Hoppy. I am already decided. I'm doing what Ben would like me to do. But if he saw what would result, he would not be satisfied. That’s not right, Hoppy, and I’m certainly attending to him I know that Julie, but I counted on your wisdom. You and the guys could make about twenty thousand with Bar 20. It looks like an order. Yes it is. Okay, Julie. I hope you're right, Julie. Bye! So... I think I joined the wood business. Congratulations, Mrs. Jordan. Ah, Julie, this is great! I think you made a very sensible business decision. Put the luggage right there, Jimmy. I just came to say goodbye, Mrs. Julie. Jimmy, wouldn't you like to stay here and work for me? No, not without Hoppy. See you later! Goodbye, Jimmy. Ah, but this is a shame. I'm leaving and... I have to go talk to Jimmy and... But first... I know the time is not good... But I know that going... Yes, California! Is it... is it yours? Ah, you have no way. Get out of here! Well, I think we won't have any more problems, all right, Mrs. Jordan. Let's see... Let's go guys! Hey, wait a minute! Where do you think you're going? To the road. I'm more of a victim of your fights, you made me lose it. It is a desert region. There is no food or even water. Enough for you. I'm leaving. I will give you a lesson that you will never forget. Fix that! - What is the problem? - Those are quarrelsome. They always cause a problem. Surrender! Stand up! Hey, you're doing it illegally! What's illegal about that? That ticket! I have nothing to do with it. He has to talk to the new owner. She's over at Keefer's office. Give it to me! Why are you up to this? I work for Daniel Keefer. My name is Taggart. You know, Hoppy, this is one of the men, involved in the death of Julie's husband. - Are you sure? - I'm pretty sure. Hey, wait a minute! I saw you on her land two days ago. I was there a month ago, once. Your face looks familiar. I have the impression that... You must have mistaken me for someone. I don't think so, one of them is dead. You don't own this place, Cassidy. It doesn't have that power. If you are smart you will take care of your life. Hey, what did you want, hitting that couple? It will not happen again! you leave here alone. Right! Ended? Ended! Are you going to let Taggart go, Hoppy? Why don't you grab it. What for, if we can't prove that he killed Jordan? Well, I think I could force you to say something. He works for Keefer. Keefer works for Familic. And then? So we're not going! You know, Mr. Cassidy, I was talking about young Jordan. Yes. It couldn't have happened to him. I also think. He was as valuable as anyone. The last words he said to us were: "Now I can see clearly, the price the Jordan owed all this time. " And said how he expected to pay? He said something about the railway, didn't he, Joe? Yes, he wanted to do a deal with the railway, cutting and delivering wood. Um... with the railway... Debt contract with the railroad. Thirty-three dollars, as in this page, in cash. Here's an advance. Sign here. please! I think Hoppy was wrong. Come on, Jimmy! Run over here! You go to the city to identify Taggart. And I depend on you delivering that message to him to start chasing him. Okay Hoppy. I think I'm wasting my time here. - Good luck to you. - Thanks. See you later. See you, Jimmy. Here three! For work guys! Here comes the boss. Good morning, missus. What are you cutting, Mr Taggart! Well, the initial part is always longer. You have to do better. Ah, we will. Don't worry, Julie. And will I have to ask you to call me Lady Jordan? Well, I forgot that, it's a common thing in this wood business. We all call ourselves by first name. Besides, I've never had a boss as beautiful as you. Guys, can you please make a bigger effort. Oh, certainly. Certainly. Sure. The next time you show your beautiful face around here, we will have cut down to that tallest tree. Isn't it guys? Of course! So, get back to work. Thank you, Mr. Taggart. You can stop a little, boys. It's a long day. Where are you going? Continues! Hey, where is Taggart going? Well, I think he's going to see where she's going. Everything is alright. They've already dropped, about twenty. Ah, California wants to visit some of his old friends. Those street fights? Julie, I don't see how you don't understand. You are a malleable person. Her husband knew those fights, when the city went to deal with money. He took care of this entire property. Do you think there were never fights there? I do not believe that. You say you don't want to believe. They did not deceive him when he went there. I have nothing against them either. I got married and he died. I know, but you seem to have lost your mind. I will never forgive you for this. Never! I followed the girl and saw the path she took. She was with that guy. Why don't you try to get rid of Cassidy? Like? You can try to shoot him from a distance. And the same thing happens to Slade. It will earn you a thousand dollars. Money is not good if you don't know how to spend it. You don't know how to handle a gun. So why don't you try it yourself. Let's go back to the city. Good afternoon, Mr Familic. - Ah, I thought that... - What did you think? I thought you were shooting over there. You mean you and Keefer want me to go? No, no, Mr Cassidy! You tried to take me by surprise with that shot. - Would you shoot me? - Why not? Please. Please, Mr. Cassidy. I don't want to catch you, trying to kill myself again. Remember that I let you live. What? Don't you have anybody better to keep you company, Hoppy? I know that, California, but they should be here by now. They should. Mr. Familic, I will not be able to accept that contract. I can't deal with those out-of-town men. And bad news! That team you sent me is rambling at work. What is it based on to affirm this? Give me more time or a new team. Well, I'm sorry. In these circumstances, you couldn't offer much to that land, but... I will leave everything as it is. I want to sell it. You cannot break your contract. There is a clause that says you have to bear all the losses. If you don't deliver the wood you will lose everything. You traitors! there she goes! Straight to Cassidy. I think not. She is very proud of that! This is an exceptional case. Hoppy! Hoppy! Where are you? What do you want with him now? California, you have to help me. Ah, I know you had a problem in that city. Here's the cause of everything! I will not waste time on this... - It's Julie! - What happened to her? It's the contract. She is even showing annoyance. - Where is she? - She went to the cut site. Please Whitan. Could you take care of her? I'm going there. Now you’ve put Hoppy in the mix too. - Oh, I feel like I'm going to pass out! - To faint! Support me, California! Why don't you do something, California? What can I do in this case? Touch her there, until she drinks a glass of water. I bring it in an instant. I will make a compress. I was the one who passed out. You will have a wheel to fix until the evening. Well, we can't do any more work here. We have a new job for the whole day, guys. I've been trying to catch you doing this. Oh no! Okay, Julie. You will see how I will treat you now. Let him out. Stand up! drop it, Taggart! Thank you California. Julie, get on my horse! Julie... these people are all for you. They worked for the Jordans for a few years. I know well, what they got. I think I did. You still have a chance. We are all good woodcutters, inclusive. Certainly. We can do the job that is left behind. Certainly. Tell me what to do Hoppy? I would fire that team and set up a new one if you let me. - You have. - Great. Guys, all here at dawn. Do not approach. I'll find out what all this means. What does that mean? What are you doing here? I am a new worker and I do my job. Oh yes? Who authorized it? Mrs. Jordan, your former boss. Mrs. Jordan, isn't it? Well I think she wants to see me out of here. But say one thing: She needs a man to support her. You must feel helpless. Take your men out of here. You are an invader! This is a private property. Okay, Cassidy. You won this time, but i'll be back and then i'll see you invade. Stay calm, men. We are going to the city to investigate these new orders. Okay, guys. Let's go back to work! Wood! I don't think they can do it. It is little time. It looks like they still have to prepare all that land. We need to do something and fast. Well, if you give me freedom, I think I can stop it. Okay, Taggart. It's in your hands, now. Well, they certainly did a great deal of damage. For right. We can't leave Julie now. In addition we will have to get the job done on time. Joe, let's get those logs off the hill, and play on the other side. - Right. - You guys, do the same. Okay, so let's get back to work. Well, Hoppy, we already transported all the logs. - Good job, Joe. - For sure. Call the guys to celebrate. Right. There you go. We're done, Joe. Come on! It's a great thing, but now we have to stop the girl. But I did everything I could. Why don't you go there and find out another way. But this is what I'm going to do now. I'll get this over with. Go wood! That's right. Free way. Right. let's go! Taggart and some men are coming here! Take your weapons and hide. Hide yourself, boys. Get down! Get down! We will try to surprise them. Look! It's daddy! Hi, Julie. Hello Daddy. I'm happy to see your men, with you. - Because? - Hoppy looks like he's in trouble. - Where? - There in the sawdust. We have to go there! Come on, men! I don't like what I'm seeing. I will be ruined. We have to go back to the city, and ensure that those contracts are secure. I will prepare the carriage. What are you going to do? Stop that. will not be long! Jimmy! Follow that carriage! Have you seen this man before, Butt Ah, now! Here is the man who killed Julie's husband. Take it easy. Don't get your hands dirty. Come on! Stand up! The man next to him must have turned into a chicken. Let's go! Did you do it, Butt? Better than I thought. Stand up! That's right. Do not shot! Do not shot! Here is the part of the income that is up to you. Thank you, Hoppy. Do you have any complaints about not going to jail? Here's the part of you, deserved for leaving home, and went to the Jordan lands. Ah, thank you very much, Julie. And this is the new railroad contract, so they can start soon, You only need your signatures to take effect. Everything we always seek, our whole life. We owe you a lot, Lady Jordan. You owe it to Hoppy. That's right. - Thanks, Hoppy. - Thanks. Bye! - Goodbye, Hoppy. - Goodbye Hoopy. Thank you thank you. - See you later, Hoppy. - Goodbye, Hoppy. Goodbye, thank you. Thanks. See you later. Arrangements and sync by Westernkasa / GM NOV2020
