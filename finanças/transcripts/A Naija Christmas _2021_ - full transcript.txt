If my boss catches me, it won't be funny. - Just five more minutes. - This is where the magic happens. - Wow. - Yeah, this is my heaven. Good morning, sir. - Oh, Amos. - I wasn't expecting you this early. - I'm here. Please sit. - Thank you. I'm just gonna hop to the other side so I can be next to you. Get out! And shut my door. So, uh, you like it? Yeah, but it's cold. Oh, yes, so we have to leave the AC on 24 hours. Five degrees Celsius to help cool all of these expensive equipments. - Oh, nice. - Oh, yeah. I got you. - Thank you. - And yeah, a whiskey. That's to help you with the cold. - Oh, that's fine. - To pick up where we left. Nice. And I know what's left. I need to set the mood. - Hear that? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, surround. See, okay, I can't help myself, all right? From the moment I set my eyes on you, it's felt like you're a rhythm I can't get rid of, just like this beat. Come here. Come. Oh, God. What are you up to? Come! - Let's just dance. - Okay. - I know this is quite early. - Mmm. But, um... I can't get you out of my mind, Tanwa. That's not my name. - I'm sorry, Tessy. - No. - I'll show this bastard. - I'll deal with him. - How did you two get in here? - You lying shit. - How did you get in here? - How dare you, you two-timing scum! - Hey. Get out of my studio. - Lying dog. - Oh? You're the dog! Get out of my studio. - Come out. I will destroy you! Hey! Hey. Who the hell are you? - I'm... - How did you get in here? - I can explain. - Explain what? Amos brought you in here. I told him stop bringing side chicks to my studio. - Me? Chick? - Hey! Wait, Tessy... Uh... Tanya, that is very expensive, do not do it. No, no! That's my mixer. - There's fire! My goodness. Stop! - You think it's a joke, right? Where have you been? Get these witches out of my studio! Get them out. Get them out of... Don't touch me! - Let me deal with this bastard! - You are not coming back here! - Get... Throw them in the bin! - I'm coming back. I'll come back for you. My mixer! My demo. I don't... My mixer. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bro, calm down now. You're shouting, please. Don't tell me you forgot about our appointment. I'll be there. All right. I'm coming. My mixer. - Hello? - My demo. Ugo? Is everything okay? This guy is crazy. Obi, what's up? - Where are you guys now? - Speak louder, I can't hear you, bro. Chike, you guys better not be late. Don't sweat it. I'm gonna be there, okay? So sorry. I know this is not a good time. - But my demo. - Woman! It is never going to be a good time. Stop disturbing me. No, but my demo, it means a lot to me. I need... What? What the... My baby. "I do it." - What does that even mean? - That's just bad spelling. It should be "I-D-I-O-T," not "I-D-O-I-T." That's "idiot." Thank you very much. I can spell. Okay? How do I end up with women that can't even spell? - What is this... - Sorry, sorry, but my demo... - What... What... What is this? What is this? - Please. I must record it again. That demo means a lot to me. Woman! Woman, stay away from me. I will come back. - Get out. - When you calm down, I'll come back. - Don't. - I'll be back. - You'll see me again. - Do not come back here. My baby. Ladies of Undiluted Destiny, we are fully in the ember months and time is not on our side. We need to start planning the theme of our annual children's Christmas gala party. - I was thinking... - Ah! Wait, Madam Agatha, please. Ladies, I have a very special announcement to make. Yesterday, to the glory of God... - Glory! - Hallelujah! Yesterday, I, Deaconess Fakorede, became a grandmother. Glory! Aw, what a cutie! Don't worry. Don't worry. You can check his photos on my social media handles. Deaconess Fakorede, congratulations! Thank you. Thank you, Madam Agatha. Don't worry, eh. Your time will soon come. With three grown-up sons, isn't it time for you to be a grandmother? Like all of us here? Excluding secretary Mrs. Bliss. Should we make it a prayer point? Maybe it's a spiritual problem that needs to be tackled with serious prayer. - Exactly. - You know that Chike boy. Maybe if their father was alive. You should go to the mountain and start holding prayer. - It's a foundational issue. - Enough. Enough. Enough. I said enough! So where's this shenanigan happening? Uh, I see them over there. That's Obi. Vera, babycakes. - Are you still there? - Yeah. I'm in line for popcorn. Okay, cool. Um, take your time. Love you. Obi, Obi, Obi, Obi, Obi. Relax. Relax, okay? Calm down. How am I supposed to calm down when she is almost here and they are not here? Chike has my stuff, Kaneng! Okay. Obi, I swear, if you spit on me one more time... - Incoming! - Thank God! - Is everything there? - Yeah, everything's there. - What have we missed? - Nothing yet. As your older brother, Obi, no pressure, all right? You can come back to the single side with me. - You don't have to do this. - What are you saying? - Don't mind him. Where's Vera? - She's almost here. - No pressure, all right. - You guys know the plan, now hide! - Hide! Hide now. - Wait, hide where? She's coming. Hide. My bad. Excuse me. What the heck? Hey! What are you doing? What's going on? Obi? Free me, please! It's okay now! You can stop this nonsense. What's going on? Take these things off! ♪ I give my body and soul to you ♪ What's going on? - Love of my heart. - Obi, what are you wearing? Will you marry me? Mama? Mama, please come. - Mama! - Mama, come back. - Mama, come now. - So what? - Mama, please, calm down. - I'm calm. I'm so, so calm. Very calm! I really don't see why you're angry, Madam Agatha. - Can't we show concern? - I don't need your concern. And for your information, at this moment, this very hour, my second son, Obi, is proposing marriage to a beautiful lady. And she's going to give me beautiful grandchildren. Amen. You mean, this Obi? Will you marry me? Say yes! Say yes! Yes, yes... Vera! Vera! Vera! Vera! Vera! - Mama! - Wait. Mama! Madam Agatha! Let's give her air. - Wake up. - Madam Agatha. Look at that. Aw. - Thank you for calling. - And thank you for waiting. Of course we will wait. How is Mama? Yes. Thankfully, it was just an anxiety attack. I always warned her about her blood pressure, which is high right now. But it's going down and all she needs to do is rest. - Okay. - Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome. - But, Doctor, what caused the attack? Ah, some ladies from the church said she's responding or she's reacting to some video she saw that was posted online. - Well, I'll see you guys. - Thank you, sir. Vera, don't go! Wait, Vera, please hear me out. Obi, you're trending, oh. Wait, #IdiotRejectionGuy. I caused this. I can't face her. Don't hiss. Calm down, bro. Come on, Obi, now. Come on. Mama? - Mama. - Mama. Mama. Mama, are you okay? Mama, how are you feeling? As soon as we heard you were here, we rushed down. Are you fine? What a pity. - If only you boys would emulate me. - Mama, why are you crying? Hmm... Where is Obi? Mama, I'm here. Obi, my darling. When am I going to become a grandmother? Sorry, Mama. Mama? - Your BP! - Whose BP? You'll be shouting "BP," but you are the cause now. What have I done to you boys that you're punishing me like this? - Mama! - Shut up. - As for you, Ugo. - Ma? You are just distributing it here and there. No control, nothing. You are just planting your sperm everywhere. Which doesn't make sense. - And you, Chike. - Yes. God did not create you a eunuch. Why did you decide to turn yourself into one? Ah... I thought I was dying. - You're not going to die, Mama. - Shut up! I said to myself... Agatha Ann, Agusoye, Agu, I. You three have decided to make my life miserable. Is this how I'm going to live? Huh? Not seeing my sons settling down and getting married? It's okay if you want me to die like this. You boys don't care. Mama. Mama, please, what happened with Vera, that was just a minor setback. I promise you, I will marry her. Ma, he said married. Huh? Oh, I have a lady. I have a special lady in my life. - You? - Oh, yes, Mama. You, Ugo? Who? Mama, finally, yes. Yes. A very, very beautiful lady. I can't wait for you to meet her. But then we agreed to take things slowly because it's a lifetime commitment, Mama. You know, small small, I will bring her so I can introduce her to you. What about you? Me? Uh, me? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I... I... I found someone. Um, we're taking it slow. Lifetime commitment. Really? Copy and paste. Really? That's the best you can come up with? Really? And so, when are you boys going to bring the women? - Oh, well... - Um... We need to make sure that... - What I'm thinking is that... - Maybe Christmas? Eh? - Christmas? - Did I say Christmas? I think I said... Christmas! Ah! I'm so happy. Wonderful. Thank God. This is great news. Christmas! Ah! I'm all right now. I'm very, very okay. - You're fine now? - Call the doctor. I'm okay now. I want to start... Remove these things now. No, Mama, you cannot go. - Mommy? - Yes? We are going to take turns staying with you here at home until you're in better health. Eat, eat. - We still have some more. - Thank you. Put that thing down. Stop it. Okay. Who is this Samuel texting? Um... Just a friend. Oh, okay. You know what, boys? Seeing you all here together in this house, reminds me of when you were little boys playing and laughing. And the house is so busy. Oh, it was so wonderful. Pleasant memory. You know what? I have decided that whichever of you boys that settles down and marries first, will take this house. Hmm? What is it? Drink water. Have some water. Give him water now! You have always rushed your food since you were a child. I wasn't rushing the food. It was what you said that rushed into my throat. Mommy, this house, this is my right. I'm the first son. This house comes to me. They're just children now. This house goes to whoever I say it belongs to. And that is the son that is ready to take this house as a family house and not a playhouse. - Mama? - Hmm? Ever since I was a boy growing up in this house, it has been my dream to get married, have children, and raise them here. - Turn the house into a home. - Will you keep quiet! Does it taste good in your mouth, what you're saying? - Does it make sense? - What is your problem? You're my only problem. - In this life you're my only problem. - How am I your only problem? - Because you don't know your place. - Do you know your place? Mama, sorry. Mama, please drink water. Drink water, drink water. Please. - Are you okay? - You want to kill me. - Sorry. - Leave me alone! Leave me. Let me be. You want to kill me. Hey, I'm warning you boys. It's like you have forgotten the kind of mother you have. Pass me the water. I need to wash my hands. Is he not the one misyarning, talking rubbish? Shut up. You big fool. Mama. You know that I have a dream to have children and raise them... Ugo, what is wrong with you? - Mimic me one more time... - What are you doing to do about it? Chike, you too? Both of you, you're thinking of taking this house from me? Not my business. - No interest. Count me out. - That's why I like you, Chike. You have sense. That is the best decision you've ever made in your life. So, Obi, this is between you and me, right? What's the condition, first to marry? Hmm? You couldn't even keep the girl you had. Shouting up and down, "Vera!" "Vera! Vera." Really, Ugo? Really, really mature. Don't go... go... go... go..." - Guys, I need to go. - You're not going to finish? No, I'm going. Going... go... go... go... That's it. This partnership is over. I want my 50% back. Cassie, Cassie, can you just calm down? This is just a temporary setback. Just a... - Just calm down. Exactly, whoosah. - We owe rent. And how many times would I warn you to stop bringing ashy club girls in here? Okay, I've heard you. I will fix this. We needed a remodeling anyways. I'm gonna turn on the light. It might piss you off but calm down. My goodness. Oh! Torpedo. - Mr. Tony Torpedo. - Yes. Uh, that's my, uh, financial partner. Since when? Since... since. You know what's gonna happen? - I'm gonna have a brief meeting with him. - Ugo. Yes, I'm gonna talk with him real quick. I have a plan. I will call you. I will call you. Just stay close to your phone. I promise you. You know I got you. I'll call you. I'll call you. Hey, Mr. Torpedo. Tony Torpedo. I'm sorry about this. I'm just remodeling. When do I get my money? When I marry. Let me explain that to you, okay? So, um... when I marry, I will inherit the equivalent of two plots of prime Ikoyi property. And, of course, we all know that is money now. That's millions. So, from that I will pay you what I owe you. Ah... You know how these things work. Eh? If you don't give me my bar with interest, you know you have to give me something. Um... Well, I understand. There's nothing I can... Why don't you just let me work on this, get married and then I'll pay you with interest. I know you like that. That's what you like. Extra... You know I really know what you like. Ah... Mmm... - Nice wristwatch. - Yeah, it's a... it's a gift. It's a, uh, best record sales gift. It's really nice. - Torpedo. - You keep in touch. Hmm. Let's get married. Hey, hi, Jemila. Oh my goodness, it's been so long. Hello? Hey! Uh... So, uh, last night I dreamt about you. You know I dreamt about you last night. ...to use your name on this track. Your name has been all over my mind. This is Ego, right? I'm talking to Ego, right? Ten years is quite a long time. What are you doing? Are you still... - Hey! - Oh, I picked the wrong number. - I apologize. - How you doing? I was thinking that... What are you thinking about, stupid boy? Bastard. Idiot. Heartbreaker. I hate you, get... Wow. What's with the curses? Vera! Vera! Vera! Good morning, sir. All right, guys, this is a very serious matter. One of our clients wants us to create a fresh, innovative campaign idea for cable wires. They want us to have something that would express... They want a concept that will speak joy and happiness from cable wires. Unfortunately, we have to work through the weekend, guys. And I'm expecting great results. Let's move. Vera, babycakes. Don't you "babycakes" me. You humiliated me outside and you want to do the same at work too? But we have been dating for almost a year now. And... did I say I want to marry you? Vera, I can make you happy. Oh. Fine. If you want to make me happy, come up with a great pitch for these cable wire people. That's going to be a big promotion for us. But I was thinking... - Me, you... - Obi. Come up with a great idea, you can make me happy. Let's nail this together. Sorry, guys. What did I miss? Are those pajamas? Paja... No! It's a style. Smart casual. Here's the brief. Make sure you get them done. Wire? So, ladies, I called for this emergency meeting so that we can deliberate on our annual children's Christmas gala night. Madam Agatha, don't worry. I already planned it in your absence. As the president of the Ladies of Undiluted Dest... Mama, we honestly did not want to stress you. Yes, Mama, and risk another attack. I'm fine. I'm very fine. You see, as president of the Ladies of Undiluted Destiny, I have a sacred duty to perform. You know, when I was in the hospital, a voice came to me. And said, "Agatha, you cannot rest until you finish this your tenure as the president and do good." So, did this voice also tell you what the theme of this year will be? - Because we already decided. - Exactly! Actually... Um, yes. Uh... you see, we usually have the party in the hall, the big hall, but, uh, I think we should have it outside this year. - Out where? - In the streets? The ghetto? Oh. Oh, yes. The ghetto. - The ghetto? - Of course. - We've never done that before. - Maybe we could do Mushin. Mm-hmm. - Mushin. - Splendid, yes. - The security implications alone... - Deaconess, God spoke to her. Glory. - Mushin? - Yeah! Look... Ah! See? It's nice! Oh! This! - You kinda look good. - Thank you! Hello, baby. Can I take you out for some jollof rice this afternoon? Hmm? Finally, a smile. What is this one? Because... you're my best friend. See? I brought your favorite. Spicy cow feet. I'm not hungry. - Kaneng. - Mmm. What am I going to do about this Vera situation? You still want Vera back? After she humiliated you in front of the whole world? Babe's juju must be strong. I don't expect you to understand. You haven't fallen for someone before. Well, if you must fall, clear ground first. That's what breaking up with Tony taught me. Tony, your banker boyfriend? Why do you think I'm wearing pajamas to the office? I finally broke up with Tony. Man, that guy's not loyal at all. Do you know what that non-entity did for revenge? He pushed me out of his flat and he locked all of my clothes inside. This was the only thing I could wear to get to work on time. I'm sorry. - Hey, Obi? - Hmm? If you really want Vera back, then make her realize what she's missing with you. How? Go out with someone else. Kaneng, this is not secondary school. Okay? Nobody falls for that rubbish anymore. Obi, I need a copy of the last document, so if you can get it done ASAP, I'll appreciate it. Mm! Open wide! Yum. Thank you. You know eating here is against company policy. That's why there's a staff cafeteria. Oh... And it's stinking up the place. Thanks, Vera. - You see? You see? - See what? If we keep this up, she'll come running back to you in no time. Before Christmas? Why not? Before Christmas? Thank you. You are a genius. Okay, okay, okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's enough. Um... Just take this thing off. It's tight. This thing is called a friendship bracelet. Or... a... lovers' knot. Or... it's too tight and you need to take this thing off. Hey! Look, Ugo, why don't you just ask your mom for the money? Nope. - How about your brother? - No way. Cassie, I have told you, all I have to do is very simple. I need to get married, my mom will gift me the property, I sell it, I make the money, I pay my debt. It's that simple. That's crazy. Maybe. I mean, like I've said, all I need to do is find someone. Hmm. Hmm? What's "hmm"? Mama, it's less than 120. That's very good. - Ready? - Yeah. Mommy! It's so good to finally meet you. - Who are you? - Uh, Cassie. The special lady I told you about at the hospital, remember? - Ooh, Cassie. - Yes. She's so colorful. Ah. You know what, my daughter? We have to have a talk. Woman-to-woman talk. Eh? Come. Follow me. Uh... Um, Mom? I don't bite. Score! 419. We all know that Cassie is just your business partner. So what game are you playing? Oh, I'm playing the winning game. By the way, Obi, where's Vera? - Vera... ra... ra... ra... - That's the last time you call her name. What's your problem? - Okay. - What's your problem? - Okay. - Are you drunk? Yeah, do I look drunk? I'm gonna invite you for my wedding, by the way. In fact, you're my best man. I don't care if you're happy or not, all right? Can you hear the laughter? That's a good sign. I thought you're meant to be the eldest brother. Do you want me to slap you? Go ahead and try. You think it's by gym? Do you want a slap? I will slap you back. Hey, Sammy, let me call you back. Who is this Sammy fellow? Uh, nobody. Just a client. - Just a client? - Yeah, a client. Cassie? What happened? Are you okay? Your mom... she's good. - What happened? - She's real good. She says I'm going to hell. Ah! - I'm outta here. - No, Cassie. Cassie. - Cassie, it's not that deep. - Cassie! Eee... Eee... Eee... - Cassie the assie. - Mm-hmm. Huh? That's her nickname. That girl is not your girlfriend. Can you imagine? He lied to me. Sorry, Mama. - He lied to me. - Stop crying now. - Mama? - You see what you've caused? See? - My BP. - Don't touch. Sit down. Sorry. See what you caused? - Sorry, Ma. - Oh... - BP's rising. - Sorry, Ma. He lied to me. He's turning this house into a house of lies. I am very, very sorry. You tricked me. All I'm asking is bring good girls to me. Is it too much for me to ask?

Our brother Tom, at the drum, will be leaving for further studies abroad. And we're looking for a replacement for that department. So we would welcome a volunteer. Who would like to take his place in the name of the Lord? Hallelujah. If you're interested, can you please indicate - by raising up your hand? - Uh, I... I can do it. What's wrong with you? Did you tell me you were coming here to raise your hands? Please, what's the name? - Um... - Ah-ah-ah-ah... Pastor, he's Ugo. - Ugo. - My eldest son. Very good music. Behave yourself. May the blessings of God Almighty be upon your household for volunteering to give your son out to praise the Lord. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Amen. You see, even as a child, before he could talk, if I need to calm Ugo down, all I need do, is just to play music. He'd be so calm. You see, dear, I forgot. You attend service from Mushin, right? - Yes, Ma. - Oh, that's good of you. You see, the Ladies of Undiluted Destiny... We are planning on having our annual Christmas gala in Mushin. - And I know you will help us. - Yes, Ma. - You will do that. - It's fine, Ma. Ah. Wonderful. You can help us set up the children's choir. - Okay. - And you'll teach them traditional carol. - What about that? - Okay, Ma. Yes. - Thank you so much. - Thank you, Ma. - Did you call me? - Me? No, no. Call you? No. Oh, all the same, since you're here already we were actually talking about him. - About you. - Ah. Yes, Mrs... Mrs. Bliss. Mrs... Sister Ajike. I didn't know you were a sister. I didn't know you were a brother. Oh no. No. Technically, no. I don't come here often. All right, I just came here, but I... I just wanted to tell you that you slay. I didn't know you could sing. How would you know? After you chased me from your studio. Please, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, okay. They say forgiveness is divine. But let me make it up to you. Come by the studio and I'll do a new one for you. Free. - Just like that? - Just like that. Just like that. Because you're a sister and I'm a brother, plus I am the newest member of the choir, so... You know what, give me your number. No, Brother Ugo, it doesn't work like that. You see, you have to go through the proper channels before you can join the music department. Good luck. But... Oh, this is the Lord's work. No, no, no, please. Is this the best you can come up with? This idea doesn't excite me at all about cables. Does it excite you? Does it excite you? Does it excite any of you here? This what you brought me to do on a Sunday? - You guys just wasted my Sunday. - Sir. I'm sure we could come up with something better. - You better do. - We will, sir. Just give us a few more days and we'll get back to you. Thank you so much, sir. Stop trying to sabotage me. - Someone give me the file, please! - Me? If you care about me, like you profess, prove it by nailing this contract for us. The team is doing their best. But, Vera, let's talk about you, okay? Do you really care about me? Or are you just using me? Obi... Hmm? Does this mean that we are back together? Maybe. But let's get this contract out of the way first. Till then... we'll take things slowly. - Hey, bro. - Hey. So it's your turn to stay with Mama, but don't get too comfortable, all right? Because very soon I'm bringing my significant other to meet Mama. You know, I need her to come here and see where we're going to be living. Mmm. You mean one of your club girls? Come on now, Obi. Really? Sister Ajike, beautiful. Mama approved. A hundred percent wife material. In choir. - Sent from God in Heaven above. - Vera and I are getting married. - Vera agreed to marry you? - Mm-hmm. Well... No, not exactly. We agreed to take things slow. Oh, my goodness, Obi, when a woman says that, it means N-O, in capital letters. All right? Like I said, don't get too comfortable. I got to go. Go... go... go... Bye! Don't go! Go! So this is where the magic happens. Please come in. Have a seat. - Okay. Thank you. - Yeah. - Can I offer you anything? Whiskey? - No. Thank you. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You are going to freeze. I can tell already, 'cause here, we leave the AC on 24 hours, five degrees Celsius. So that all of this expensive equipment can be cool. Hmm. I see. Excuse me. Excuse me. Um, let me play something nice to set the mood. You hear that? Installed the best surround system. Mm. This beat, it sounds familiar. - Oh really? - Mmm. Oh, it must have been a leaked version, because this song and this beat was created here by a brilliant artist. - Hmm. - Yeah. - Aduke. - Ajike. - Ajike. Sister Ajike. - Sister Ajike. Yeah, okay, look, I'm going to be honest with you. Ever since I set my eyes on you, from that very moment, you have been stuck in my head like a rhythm. Hmm. Rhythm that I can't get rid of. Just like this beat. Hmm. - Okay, I have to go. - Whoa, whoa. Why do you have to go? Oh, because this beat is for Tanwa. Or is it Tessa? - How do you know... - I was here that morning. - Right. Yes, you... - Yes. - Yes, you were here. - Mm-hmm. - You... - Look, Brother Ugo. I'm serious about the choir. Very serious. And if you just want to play games, I think you should stay away. - Ugo. - Jesus Christ! Oh my goodness. - How did you... - Javelin helped. Oh, hey. Hey, Javelin. How's it going? Uh, okay. So welcome to my house. I don't hear wedding bells. Oh, Torpedo... It's still quite early, okay? But I'm working on it. That I promise you. Yeah. So what's up? Can I offer you something to drink? That's... That's my little fish. My only flatmate. I call him Tony. Uh... Golden Tony. Not Tony Torpedo. Ignore what I said. Uh... This is nice. - That is the... - Smart TV. Yes, that's a smart TV. Yes, it is a smart TV. Be reasonable... Torpedo, come on now, it's just a TV. Javelin! You don't need a TV. Torpedo, come on now. Just... Just a little time. You don't... Young man, may we get to know you? Very well. My name Ugochukwu Agu. Ugo, for short. - I am the son of Dame Agatha... - We already know your mother. It is you we want to know. Well, I am a music producer. Are you a music producer like Don Jazzy? Uh, well... Are you making music that encourages young women to become loose? Or the kind that promotes yahoo-yahoo, where young men sag and dance very indecently? Actually, sir, there's some decent music artists that have used his studio. And even me, I've recorded a demo there before. And you will... many more. I think if Sister Ajike is going there to record, it should be a decent studio. It is good that you are promoting decent music. It's all for divine need. Well... Given that everyone seems to have certified you, there's no point delaying this interview further. Young man, we will be getting back to you via text. Text? Okay, that... that was tough. But, uh, thank you for having my back. I was just being factual. All right, well, are you rushing somewhere? You seem like you're in a hurry. Yes, I'm meeting your mother in Mushin, for the gala. Ah. Do you live in Mushin? Yes, and so? You don't seem like someone that lives in Mushin. Or should live in Mushin. - Okay. - Ajike. Ajike. Um...  Sorry. Um... Can I escort you? All right, you can come. Let's go. Oh. Some of your mom's results just came out from the tests we conducted and she has to come back to the hospital immediately. Whoa. I'm actually going somewhere very important right now. Can't we do that later? No, no, no, it's urgent. She's gotta come back immediately. I'm also turning back to the hospital, so meet me at the hospital. Okay, Doc. Okay, Doc. Gotcha. Mommy, change of plans. - My big brothers. - Ajike Ade. - You look good, Ajike. - I agree. - What's happening here? Is there a party? - Smart girl. What is this? Why wasn't I invited? Ajike, you should know this is our usual way of relaxing. - Who's this English man? - He's my friend. Are we the ones he is waving at? In this ghetto? Will you raise up your hands? When you come here, you greet the ghetto boys like you're from here. - Say "Salute!" - Salute. Salute! Correct! Now you understand how it works here. Ajike, let us know if he dares to misbehave. No, he won't. Let us know, so we can help you. I'll let you know. - If he becomes too crazy... - No! Please, let him be. - Thank you. - Fine boy. You promised to teach us a song. - It's not ready. - When will you teach us? Christmas Day. - You're prepared to sing with me? - Yes. Are you sure? Okay, high five. My regards to your Mom. Okay, wait was that... Was that about the, um, the demo you made? The song you made? Oh yes, I wanted to market it for them this Christmas. Oh, for real? It's not that bad. I mean it's not bad, like bad-bad. - Oh, Deaconess, you're here. - Where is Madam Agatha? I'm thinking she's on her way. Gosh, the stench of this place. How can I stay? Gosh, I can't breathe. - Here she comes. - About time. This is what I was saying. - Good afternoon. - Where's Madam Agatha? - She wants to speak with you. - Okay. Madam Agatha, where are you? I was on my way to you when Chike told me change of plans. - He has driven me to the hospital. - Mm-hmm. I will join you in the next few minutes. Mrs. Bliss? Um, Mama? I'm counting on you. I'm counting on you. Yes, just take care of yourself. We'll handle things here. - I guess we can leave now. - Take care, Mama. - Take care. - We should be able to... Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop there! Give that back. Stop! Bring that back! Bring the bag! How much is in the bag really? Ah! Solo! Solo! Solo! Chike! He stole Mrs. Bliss' bag. - The boss himself. - Return the bag immediately. Have it. - Ajike, my dear. - Good afternoon, sir. You are worth celebrating at all times. Thank you, sir. Whose visitors are these? They are my friends, sir. This is my uncle, Prof. - Salute! Salute! - What's salute? - Greet him properly. - What are you doing? Ajikks... You guys, none of these ideas are landing. - Cables as suspension wires? - Tony, please. - I'm not coming back. - Where's the joy and happiness in that? - You can take all my clothes. - Now we're back to utility. I don't care. I told you the clients want something that will speak joy. - Are you crying? - That will tug at the heart. Kaneng. Are you with us? Guys... I have an idea. So, imagine a large Christmas tree lit up by Vortex wires and cables. Now this will transform the entire place. It will bring joy and warmth to everyone in the area. We can achieve this. Like I said, keep it simple. "Christmas in the Ghetto." Thank you for your time. I like it. I like it very much. Is this ghetto gala a real thing? - Yes, sir. - Maybe we can sponsor it. - Tie everything together. Well done. - Thank you, sir. - Keep me posted on this. - I will, sir. - Nice work. - Thank you, sir. Well done, guys. - Congratulations, Obi. - Thanks. Uh... - Are you happy now? - Yes. So, is our engagement official now? Not so fast. We still need a team to go to Mushin. Okay. Any volunteers to Mushin? Anyone wants to volunteer to go to Mushin? I'll go. Not you. Anyone else? Anyone? Fine. You'll both go. But first, I want to appreciate you. - Okay. - Tonight? Yours or my place? My place. Mine. Mine. Yours. - Later. - Later. Mommy, calm down. Just rest, okay? Mommy, rest. I got this. I got this. What are your plans? Building a shrine? - We don't understand. Please explain. - No, it's not a shrine. It is not a shrine. It is a... What is...? - It's a gazebo for Santa. - Yeah. Where kids gather to get gifts. - Do you mean Satan's house? - No, you are getting it wrong. - Like Father Christmas. - Ah! Now we understand. Father Christmas? You should have said it in simple English. We heard you'll share some small chops. What does that mean? We don't want that. We want yam flour, jollof rice and well-made semo. I trust Sikira's mom to make a delicious vegetable soup to go with the semo. - Exactly! - Uh... That's fine. Anything else? I heard you talking about Caro. What's Caro have to do with what we're planning? No, carol singing. You know, Christmas carols. - They meant Christmas carol. - Like... ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ What have carols got to do with the likes of us?

So, where are they? Your girlfriends. I'm done with that life. - Ah. - Yeah. I'm now looking for... someone special. Something more permanent. Can we record? Yes. Yes, we can.

Can you please not spoil it? Yeah. Um... It's about time you left. Yeah. Good night. Good morning, Obi. Are you ready for the ghetto? Vera. I waited. I called. I was worried. Where were you? I was at work. Hey... Sorry. I forgot. And you are not dressed. Are you sure we can still make it to Mushin? Go get ready. Go, go, go, go! Kaneng. What are you doing here? Vera. I needed a lift to Mushin. A lift. How convenient. - Okay, I'll be going. - No, no, no. It's fine. You can stay. You're already here and we're heading the same way. And it's for work purpose anyway. Obi is having his bath. Mm-hmm. He had a very busy night. Kaneng. Now, we can go together. This is so inconvenient, Obi. You should have checked the car before we set out. Do you even know how dangerous this place is? I'm just hoping we don't get robbed. You know what? I'm going to call an Uber. - I'm not doing this. - Vera, relax. - Let me see if I can handle it. - I'll come with you. It can't be overheating. I think it's the battery. What are you doing? Try it.

Our client will be delighted to sponsor this gala. - Thank you! - And it was all Obi's idea. Yes, it was Obi's idea. Yes, I said that already. Yeah, Obi's idea. Great! They took the fish tank too?

Cassie... You have gone there. You've been there before. - Hello? - Hey, Cassie. I can't... Hello? Seems like a lot of people here. But it doesn't seem like a "club" club. It's like... It feels it's like a house party. Are you sure? Wait, when I said "all night" you sounded like you knew what I was talking about. Brother Ugo, you're welcome. Let me get Sister Ajike for you. - All right, thank you. - Sister Ajike! Ma? I'll update you, Cassie. Brother Ugo, you made it. Yes, I did. - Uh... - Please come in. Um, so I was a bit confused when I got here. I'm not sure if this is... It's the right place, yeah. I quickly need to do something, can you please hold him? That's very good. Okay, with the band please. Okay. From the beginning. Ugo. Sorry, it's too fast. Thank you. Hold on. Ugo! Ugo. Softly. It's a carol. What kind of behavior is that in front of children? All night. Really? - What are you talking about? - Ajike! Ajike, don't pretend. You knew that I wanted to hang out with you. You had a choice to either say yes or no, but what did you do? You deceived me. Shame on you. Ugo. ♪ Take Some people don't seem to take ♪ Torpedo. Ah. Okay, Torpedo, I know why you're here. But I asked you to give me some time. We all know that when you come here you like to hold on to something. So I am sure if I look in the store I can find something valuable for you to hold on to. Yeah. Javelin! Javelin, do not touch anything. I told you to give me time, this is my livelihood, man. This is all I've got. - You want to stop us? - If I have to, I will! - Can you stop us? - Don't touch it! Ah! Ugo, what happened? Nothing. I'm okay. You're bleeding. Ah. Oh my God. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - You're not okay. We just... We had big cockroaches. I just wanted to... move some... Sorry. Move some things out and remodel the place. It's okay. It's okay. So, why don't you ask Mama or your brothers to help you pay this Torpedo guy? I can't. I can't. I'm... I'm the firstborn. It's not responsible of me. I can't. And so... Ugo, what has pride got to do anything? Ajike, please just... Just promise me that you will stay by my side. Please. That's your plan? No. No. Forget I said that. Just forget I said that. Ajike, look, I know... I know I'm not perfect. But I would really like you to give me a chance. No games. No games? So what about this? Isn't that yours? Isn't this... It looks like your size. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm... I'm joking. You see this life. It's my past. I'm... I'm... I'm done. I just want it to be me and you. - But I have one request, though. - What? Please, can we... Can we go out... a proper "all night"? Come here. Hello? Hello. Kaneng, where are you? Are you crazy? You're missing the office Christmas party. Here where? Your boyfriend must have given you back your clothes. You look... Oh, wow. Thank you. Do you wanna grab a drink? Gather round everyone. Good evening. First, I want to appreciate you all for a job well done. Especially, Obi. For a simple, but brilliant idea. I've known Obi for over a year now. And as many of you know... he asked me to marry him. Ooh. It's true. But the truth is, I was scared. I was scared because he's nice, intelligent, and a wonderful man. The truth is, I didn't deserve him. But now... Obi, the man that puts a smile on my face... Oh! ...the man that always comes through for me. Love of my heart. You know I love you. I'm asking you to marry me. Say yes, say yes. He said yes! Cheers everybody! Kaneng. Kaneng. Hey. I was looking for you. You got Vera back. Congratulations. Thank you. My boyfriend came back too. The... banker. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, he... He wants to get back together. I wasn't sure. So I... I thought I would ask you first. Ask me what? Well... Whether I should go back to him or... go elsewhere. And why are you asking me this? Because you're my best friend, and I thought I'd ask. What's wrong with your eyes? Uh, nothing, nothing. It's just... It's just this stupid fake eyelash. Let me see. Is it this one? ♪ My mind's all in a whirl ♪ ♪ For you're the only girl ♪ Auntie, you call an Uber? - Kaneng. - Yes?

Tell me now, who do you want, Kaneng or Vera? I don't know. Oh. Let's sit down. Let's sit down. - Do you want a drink? - No! - It will calm you down. - No. Okay, I got you. You know that I have wanted Vera... for the longest time. But right now, I am confused. Okay, just calm down. There are ways to solve these things, okay? Uh, let me get that. Who is it? Vera! - You look so good. Come in. - Thank you. - Best of luck. - Chike, Chike, Chike, Chike. No, I want to go inside. I'm going to get something. Hey, Obi. You disappeared on me. Hi... Hi, Vera. Um... I have something to tell you. - In the bedroom? Let's go to the bedroom. - No, no, no, no, no. Uh, I will... tell you here. Okay. I... can't... marry you anymore. I'm sorry if I have misled you, but it is Kaneng that I want. Ah. Okay, Vera. V... Vera! - Where's she? - She hit me! Where did she hit you? - I'm just tryna check if it's painful. - What do you think? I dunno, a woman's never hit me before. But really, bruv. This is actually a good thing. Okay. But look at it this way. This is a good thing. Now you can go after the person you want. What? Now you can... Now you can go for the person you want. I heard you the first time. That's what I should do. I should go for the one I want. - I should go for Sammy. Yes. - What? - Sammy? - Yeah. - No, no, no. - I am going for Sammy. Chike! Chike! Wait, wait, wait! Chike, wait!

I gave Kaneng back her stuff because I want to show how serious I am in getting us back together. But she seemed distracted and confused by you. The two of you are trespassing. I'll just leave a message. Yeah? Leave... Kaneng alone. Kaneng is not a child. She can date whoever she chooses to. Go back to Vera. Hmm? Okay. Compliments of the season! Sammy. Sammy? Sammy. Sammy. Can I help you? Sorry, who are you? Someone help me. In my house. Sorry, where's Sammy? - Sammy? - Yeah. - Oh, you mean Samantha? - Yeah. Oh, Chike, how are you? You're here so late. Is Mama okay? Or is this about the gala? Yeah, she's okay. She... She asked me to come check on you, if you are fine. Aw. That's so sweet. Say thank you to her for me. I... Um... This is Mrs. Agu's son, Chike, the gym instructor who helped me get my bag. - Let him come in. Come in. - Oh no, I'm sure Chike has to hurry back. It's late. Please say thank you to Mama for checking on me. Okay, see you around, then. All right. Good night. I'll just see him out. Okay, no problem. - But my food! - Oh yes, I'm coming. - You told me... - Calm down. - You told me he left. - He came back. Then what about us? I told you this was real for me. - But, what... - Listen, it's over. We can't do this. I am twice your age. I shouldn't... - I never cared about your age. - Shh. Sammy, look me in the eye right now and tell me that this was never real for you. - Tell me that this was all... - Get away from me. ...a game to you. It's over. Please. Hey... - She doesn't drink. - No, I can drink. Are you sure about this? Cheers! I love her! Ajike, okay, you've had enough. - Okay, I'm coming. - What? - I'm just going to go to the toilets. - Okay. Yeah, okay. DJ, please can I have the microphone? Praise the Lord! I can't hear the hallelujah! I said praise the Lord! I told you not to give her a drink. For every single one of you, hmm, who is not going to make it to church on Sunday. I want you to go to the left, to the right, to the left, - to the right. - No, guys. To the left, to the right.

We brought you back here last night. I and Cassie. Remember? I really catched fun. Thank you. Uh, here, coffee. - It'll help you clear your head. - Thank you. - Right. - Oh. And I really "catched" fun too. You were really slaying in the spirit last night. You were like... To the left, to the right, to the left... Come on, stop it. Where's your kitchen? - You want to try one? - Of course. If we had proper agege bread, this would be better. But we'll manage. Mmm. - Ajike? - Mm? Um, I would like for us to go out again on a date. Can we do that? Can we plan something? Is it because I'm cooking for you and eating in your house? No, no, no, of course not. No. - Okay. - No. I, Ajike, I like you. I really like you. I was wondering if you feel the same way. Yes, but... - I don't want to play around, Ugo. - I'm not playing around. Ajike, I'm not playing around. I... I am proposing a serious relationship. - Seriously? - Yes, for real. - Then it has to be done officially. - Okay. You have to tell the church. That's a... that's a joke, right? It's a joke. I mean, we have to have the church sanction our relationship? Mm-hmm. Young man, declare your intentions. We do not subscribe to hit and run here. Especially when it comes to Sister Ajike. Well, ma'am, sir... My intentions are entirely honorable. Sister Ajike is a special lady, who has captured my heart. And I hope that I am worthy of her. Hit and run. He wants to do hit and run. No. No. No, sir, no. I'm not trying to do hit and run. I really do care about Ajike and our relationship. But there's one rule that must be enforced. No intimacy before marriage. How is... How is that even... How is it possible? There is nothing... impossible with prayers. But in extreme case, a cold shower... will do. Kaneng. I, uh... I need to talk to you... - I'm so busy. - ...about the kiss. I ended things with Vera. Uh, why? Kaneng. Nothing seems right with her. But everything seems right with you. Kaneng, please, just give me a chance. Obi, I don't think you know what you want. I thought that you liked me. Kaneng! Kaneng. Kaneng! Kaneng! This is unnecessary. Obi, I told you to leave my girl alone, and next is you chasing Kaneng around in broad daylight. - Have you no shame? - You cannot intimidate me! I care about Kaneng, and Kaneng cares about me. Why then did Javelin see her running away from you in the car park? Boss, I don't think she was running away from him. I think she was confused because she's in love with him and doesn't know what to do about it. Shut up, Javelin! Shut up! Mr. Torpedo. The bottom line is you really cannot help who you fall in love with. And who you don't. But also... you can't force someone to love you back when they don't. Is he crying? Boss. You know someone has to pay me, right? Excuse me? It is only fair that you pay me for this emotional damage. Uh, I... I don't quite follow. Or I will break your legs! Sorry, how much are we talking about? Double... the amount your brother Ugo is owing me. Ugo. - Ugo! - Who is that? - It's me! - It's you who? - Obi. - And me, Chike. Okay, guys, um, sorry I won't be able to welcome you 'cause I have stuff to do. So maybe some other time, all right? We know about the debt. Why didn't you let us know this was going on? Open the door. How do you know? Who told you? What the... Bro, what the hell happened to all your furniture? - I was gonna change that. - The TV. Your... - Tony Torpedo. - How do you know Tony? He is Kaneng's ex-boyfriend. Wow. - Interesting. Okay. Okay. - Ugo. We are your brothers. - We could have helped. - Yeah. Look, guys, guys, I have everything under control. Wait, what? How do you have things under control, Ugo? That Tony Torpedo told me that I have to pay him double what you owe him or he won't leave Kaneng alone. So tell me, how is that having things under control? Obi, I just need you to step aside, let me marry Ajike, and everything will be fine. So that's your plan? You marry Ajike, you sell our family house, and then you pay off your debt? That's your plan? A very good plan, Obi. A perfect plan. And Obi, Obi, Obi... Real quick here, I know you want that house so bad, but wait, with Kaneng? A girl that dates loan sharks? It's his choice, actually. So... - Oh? I see. - Yeah. I see. You know what, guys? I don't have time for this. I was busy, getting ready to go meet with Ajike for the tree lighting. I'm going to go back to do me while you guys use the door, all right? - Ugo. - Wait, wait, wait, Ugo. Ajike. Wait, wait, Sister Ajike? - That's what I said. - Hold on. Hold on. This Ajike?

Everybody is happy. I look at the party I've staged. You boys are not making me happy. Before you know it, my BP will rise up again now. When people are enjoying themselves, I'll spend Christmas in the hospital. My boys, they don't like each other. Mama, we're hugging. - Mama, we're hugging. - We're hugging. Group hug. - Merry Christmas. - A group hug. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. You see? I like this. - I'm happy now. - Good afternoon. - Sorry, I got lost. Am I too late? - It's fine. It's fine. - Hi. - Hey, Kaneng. Uh, Mama, I would like to introduce someone special. Mmm? - Merry Christmas, Ma. - Merry Christmas, my darling. We need to talk. Yes. - Wait, wait, wait, what are you doing? - Come. I'm not going to bite her. Come, my dear. - That's what you said last time. - Uh-oh. - You have a lovely home, Ma. - Thank you. Yeah, um... I heard what you... what you did. You paid Tony Torpedo off. Where did you get the money? I took an advance on my promotion salary. I'll pay you back every penny. You better. Thanks, man. You're welcome. - You're welcome. - Careful, Ma. Come on, Christmas! Hey, boys. I think I like this one. She's down to earth. You know, she says no rushing. And she's sincere, honest. So I like her. And I give both of you my blessing. Ah. - Thank you, Ma. - Thank you, Mama. Merry Christmas! - Congrats. - Thanks. - Now, my dear... - Yes, Mama? Welcome to the family. - Mama, your guests are here! - Okay, let them in. No time. Congrats, bruv. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, my brothers. Now we look good, like three brothers. Welcome. Mrs. Bliss! Hi! Hey, guys. This is Salewa. Congratulations, Madam Agatha. Oh, thank you. I need to show you something. It's Christmas! Our Christmas Gala is trending. - You're too overbearing. - Olivia! - Hand me my phone, please. - Give it back. What's the meaning of this? - I'm really sorry about what happened. - It's okay, Ma. I never expected that things would turn this way. It's okay, Mama. You don't have to be sorry. The community is very happy. They said the fight added color to the gala. People are already calling for support for Mushin community. Dame Chief Mrs. Agatha Agu, this is the best gala this church has ever hosted. Glory! Thank you so much. Olivia, my phone. - You did so well. - Ladies, let's go. Deaconess, calm down. These things, take it easy. Deaconess Fakorede, come back now. Is he all right? Look, Obi, no bad blood, right? You can have the house. I believe that you and Kaneng will make a beautiful home. It's always been a beautiful home. And always will be. It'll always be our home. In the spirit of Christmas, I got you a present. - You got me a present? - Yep. - It's behind you. - What are you talking about? We invited her. Hey. Uh... Merry Christmas. Your brothers begged me to come. Ajike, I know that I have said a lot of stupid things. I've made a fool of myself. He's not wise. He's too playful. He plays way too much. But Ajike, please. Please forgive me. Ugo, you wounded me. Deeply. You were so quick to believe those things. What does that say about you? Ajike, baby. The pretty one with a slim figure. - Solo, quiet. - Aw! Ajike, please accept his apology. I am hungry and need to eat. Please, for God's sake, have mercy on me. Accept him. Let me... Ah! Heavyweights! Never! Please. Ajike, please. - He's a very nice person. - Please. - Please. - Ugo. No. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Get off me! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Thank you so much. Ay! Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas!
