Safiyari Director of Photography: M. Kalari What you are saying are not good reasons for a divorce. -lf there is something else let me know. -Like what? Like if he is an addict, beats you or does not give you an allowance. Nothing like that. He is a good, decent person. Then why do you want a divorce? He won't come with me. lf he does l'll cancel my request for a divorce. -Will you come? -No, l won't. -Why not, Your Honor? -You know why. No, l don't. Please explain again why. Let her explain why we should move abroad in these circumstances. -You give me one reason to stay. -l'll give you a thousand. -Just one. -My father. l can't leave him. But you can leave your wife? -When did l leave you? -You brought me here. You filed for a divorce. When you tell your wife and child to leave, isn't that leaving them? Your Honor, didn't he just say leave if you want? Yes, and l'll say it again. lf you don't want to stay l can't keep you by force. Keep your voice down. Calm down. One day you came to live with me. Today you don't. -When you prefer... -What does ''you prefer'' mean? This was something we both started. Your Honor, after 18 months of running around and expenses, we got our visa. lt has been six months now and it will expire in 40 days. Why should we lose this opportunity? You don't want to lose this opportunity, then make a suggestion. You know my situation. Tell us what to do, Your Honor. -His father is his excuse... -He is not my excuse. He's the reason. -Let me speak. -Calm down. His father has Alzheimer's. He doesn't even know that he's his son. -What difference does it make to him? -Why are you saying that? Does he even realize you are his son? l know he is my father. Your daughter or her future is not important to you? Who said anything about our daughter? Why do you think only you care? So the children living in this country don't have a future? As a mother, l'd rather she didn't grow up in these circumstances. What circumstances? ls she better off here with both her parents or there without a father? That's why l want him to come. l can't leave. How many times do l have to say it? He can't come. So what happens to me? Nothing. Go back to your life. lf l could l wouldn't file for a divorce. Consent has to be mutual. He just gave his. Do you agree to a divorce? lf she prefers to leave her family to go live abroad, yes, l do. He agrees. What about my daughter? You have to agree on everything. How old is your daughter? Eleven in two weeks. She can't leave without her father's permission. He won't give permission. That's between you two. Please sign here and good day. Your Honor, l came here for you to solve my problem. Please sign here. You, too. -Where should l sign? -Here. He can have everything, l just want my daughter. Our daughter is attached to me. She doesn't even want to go with you. -She doesn't know better. -Why not? She is 1 1 years old. Please sign here and don't take the court's time. -No one knows better except you. -No, you're the one who knows better. Your Honor, what should l do? l only have 40 days. You can't file for a divorce over every little problem. A little problem? My problem is not little. lt is my daughter. She is his daughter, too. He has rights, too. My finding is that your problem is a small problem. Please sign here and good day. A Separation Producer, Writer, Director Asghar Farhadi You said the second floor. This is the second floor. Then what's that? That's the ground floor, that's the first. This is the second. The price we gave was for two floors. But the buyer will pay you.

No, l've moved to my mom's. This is a bit difficult. No, you can trust him. Don't worry about these things. Besides, he won't be around. He leaves early and comes back when you leave. Do bring your daughter. She'll keep my daughter company and l'll feel better. Tell your decision to your sister-in-law. Where are you going? What's this? Oxygen. What's oxygen? Get away. You'll wake him. l can't hear anything. What is it doing? Hello. Where do you want to go? -The paper. -What? l want the paper. The paper is in your room.

Simin... Hello. l had a religious question. l am working in a house. There is an old man l am supposed to care for. l wanted to ask... Pardon me, but he has wet his pants. l wanted to know if l change him, will it count as a sin? No one is here. He's 70 or 80 years old and he's senile... The urgency is that the poor guy has been sitting like this for half an hour. l can... l won't tell Dad. My angel. Get up. Open your legs. Okay, now take off your pants. Card! Everyone's staring. Let them. -How much? -37.5. -Any change? -He didn't give it. -You asked? -lt's his tip. Tip? Sir, wait one sec. A tip is for when he pumps the gas. Go get it. -Dad! -Quick! Wait. Here. Keep it.

From tomorrow tighten it a bit more so he can't open it. Sorry but... l can't come anymore. Didn't we say every day? The commute is too much. l turned someone else away. lt's 4:00. How can l find someone now for tomorrow morning? lt's too much work. Really l can't. The work is heavy, l can't. Come to the other room, please. -Somayeh, where's your scarf? -lt's here. Maybe you're tired 'cause it's your first day. No. You were here for a few minutes. You saw. Somayeh, come get your bag. Can you please give me that number?

Tell them Qahraei sent you. They know me. -ls it a man or a woman? -A woman. Call first. You had to tell me yesterday. How can l leave him at home alone tomorrow? -Where does your mom keep the tea? -l don't know. You should've told me l'd have to clean him. Clean him? He soiled his pants today. lt's not right for me to clean him. Please pay me for today so l can go. He always said when he had to go. There are companies you can call for a male helper. l can't just let anyone into my home. Here. Count it, please. Sorry, but it's a religious issue. lt's okay. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Bye. Goodbye. Yes? l wanted to know if it is okay for me to give your number to my husband and tell him l got it out of the paper. For the housework and your father. Give him the job description and if he agrees tell him to come... l don't want to tell him l know you. l didn't tell him l was coming here. Then tell him to call me or tell him to come here tonight. lt's late for tonight. l'll come tomorrow. Just don't give the job to anyone else. You'll see with him for the money. That's not a problem. Tell him to call me. l will arrange to meet him. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Bye. And thank you. Mr. Lavasani? Go ahead. Hello. l am Samadi. -l called about the job. -Yes, how are you? Sorry l'm late. lt's okay. Where did you work before? l was a cobbler. And you're okay with cleaning him? With what? Since yesterday he's been soiling himself. l'll treat him like my own father. But you'll be alone with him and you have to really watch him. Your wife won't be there? No, l am single for now. Excuse me but isn't 300,000 too little for this work? How much did you have in mind? Maybe if you could pay 400,000... l really can't pay that. l'll come for a few days. lf you like my work, add something to the 300,000. -lf not don't pay me. -Here's the address. l can even start today. No, there's someone there today. Start tomorrow and bring an lD. Like what? Any legal lD will do. Pious? Pious? Worshipper. Barren? Sandbar. Desert! Desert. lnsurrection? Rebellion. Doorbell? -Razieh. -No! Her husband. Yes. Give the Persian version of the following words... -''Maquette''? -Nemunak. -''Compote''? -Khoshaab. -''Guarantee''? -Tazmin, zemanat. That's Arabic, not Persian. That's what my teacher said. Don't give me that. What's wrong is wrong, no matter who says what. -For ''guarantee'' write... -She'll deduct points. That's okay, let her. Write poshtvaneh. Poshtvaneh. Hello. What happened? Your husband was supposed to come today. Sorry, he couldn't make it. What about tomorrow? l don't know. lf he doesn't l'll come. l hope he won't change his mind every day. No, poor guy wanted to come. Last night, one of his creditors came with an officer and took him away. Yes, but if something comes up and he can't make it, l need to know in advance. No, he will definitely come. l'll go see the creditor and beg him to release him. Please lock the door behind me. Goodbye. Hi. Don't step on it. lt is dirty. Go take the garbage out. Can you? Yes. Where will l get you a clean dress? Take it off! Take it off! Mommy, he's not in his room. -What? -He's not in his room. Go look in the bathroom. Like that. Block the ball. Okay? Give me five. -Grandpa, whose side are you on? -He's the manager. Did you see that? What's wrong? Sit here. You okay? Where've you been? Poor thing has been waiting for half an hour. lt's a long commute. Hello. Also, take the garbage out with the bin. The bags tear and dirty the stairs.

Take them off. Scum! -Honey, did you take money from the drawer? -No. Okay, go to the kitchen. l told you to go to the kitchen. You saw that nothing happened. Go on... Close the door. Hello. Come here. Mommy, l'm thirsty. Watch him. Hello. Where were you? Something came up. l had to go out. You had no right to go. -He was asleep. -So you lock the door and leave? l was gone briefly. Briefly? You're lying. He was dying when l got here! He always naps at this time so l... So you do this every day? Lock the door and run your errands? No. l swear to God, today l had to. -Why did you tie his hand? -Go wait outside. Was this our agreement? l had to go. l had no choice. Thanks a lot! You tie his hand every day and go do your own stuff. ls he okay? Thanks a lot! Wait outside, sweetie. Go check on Grandpa. Why did you go in that room? Which room? Which room? The one you took the money from. l took money from that room? -Don't l pay you? -l took money? You didn't take it? l swear l didn't take any money. Get out. Sir, l'm swearing on our martyrs. You say l took money. Here, look in my bag. lf l took it, it should be here. Here, take this. Give me my bag. l am swearing on our martyrs that l didn't go there. Here's my bag. What are you doing? l didn't go there. l'm swearing on our martyrs that l didn't step into that room. -Get out. -You're saying... What did l do? Don't touch me! l won't touch you. Get out. l won't leave till l get what l deserve! What you deserve is for me to kick you out. Because of her l won't. Get out! l'm doing you a favor by throwing you out. Tell me what's happened to him. lt's my house, l want you out. Fine, but it's not right. -lt displeases God. -Out! That's it. Dad. Open the door. lt's me. l want to come in... This is how you watch him? Open the door. Go check what's behind you. Have a look. Open the door! lt's no use shouting. This is why l asked you to watch him. Maybe his leg hurts and he can't get up. Grandpa... Dad, open the door. Open the door, please. l'm going to push the door open. lt'll hit you, Dad. Move aside. l'm going to push the door open. Why do you do this to yourself? Who told you to come in? -What happened to him? -Give me the key. Get out! l didn't steal from you. You are pissing me off! l didn't. -Don't give me that! -l wouldn't be here now if l had. Get out. Pay me for today. You already took your pay, didn't you? Since 5:30 this morning with my daughter... Somayeh! Sir, wait! Get out. l swear l didn't steal. Get out! What happened? What happened? Sit. What happened? Mommy, be careful. Tell her to work with you on your English. Bye, Grandpa. Dad, Termeh said bye. Careful! Okay. What is it? Mom says come in. Tell her Grandpa's in the car. She says it's important. Not divorced yet and already ignoring us! l'm busy. People divorce their wives to get less busy. Ma'am, these channels have too much static. Okay, set the ones you can. -Come and sit. -Thank you. Simin... Hi. Where's Termeh? ln the car with dad. Then bring him in, too. No, he is tired. lt's his nap time. What is it? Did you have a fight with that woman? Did she come see you? Her sister-in-law called. Shameless! What did she do? Tied the old man to the bed and locked the door. Went after her own errands. lf l'd gotten there 10 minutes later, l would've lost him. ls he okay? He had fallen off the bed. l don't know for how long he was like that. Where had she gone? How should l know? She said you hit her. l hit her? -Nonsense. -Then why is she in the hospital? Hospital? Why? You're asking me? l just pushed her out of the house. The sister-in-law called and told me off. Saying what? That if she dies, her blood will be on your hands. Stuff like that. -She didn't say what happened? -l hung up. She started cursing. That's what you get for hiring people off the streets. Don't blame me. l told you l only know her sister-in-law. Did she say which hospital? -Hello. -Yes? Hold, please. A woman by the name of Razieh was brought in tonight. -What's her family name? -l don't know. She was admitted earlier. Why was she brought in? -They just told us... -That she was taken to hospital. l'll call you back. Bye. Her husband's last name is Samadi. Razieh Asnaqi? ls she in her thirties? She had surgery. She's in post-op. Why surgery? She had a miscarriage. ls she okay now? Hello? Hold. Yes. ls her family here? lf they are, they are downstairs. Thank you. What did you do to her? What did l do to her? Hello. -How are you? -Fine, thanks. Hello, ma'am. How is she? Who? Your wife. They took her to the ward. Do you know her? -l know her. -My wife. -They didn't have sandwiches. -Hello. Can we see her? Where do you know her from? Your sister introduced her to us for housework. Thanks a lot! She was coming to your house to work? She came for a few days. Apparently you couldn't come so she came in your place. Come sit and eat something. You mean she took care of your father? Just for a few days. Two or three days. Why didn't you tell me this at the bank? l thought she would tell you. Why have you come here now? To see if we can do something. Do what? Help. We were worried. Did she fall? Come with me. l'll explain. l'll explain to you... Come with me. l understand your situation. You kill her child and now you've come to do what? l'm really sorry. l'm sorry won't be a child to her. Just tell me one thing. l'll explain outside. Wait! Why didn't you tell me that day? l told you. l thought she... You live alone in that house. Let him go. Calm down. This is a hospital. Don't! Stop! Why the hell did you come here? Let me see. -My own sister? -l'm sorry. Forgive me. Let me see. Come out here. l want to talk to you. Please, l beg you. Hojjat! Do you want your seat down? No. l'll take you home then l'll get Dad and Termeh. No. No? You want to go to your parents' like this? lt's over. You're coming home tonight. l don't want to. Where are you going? Cell phone. Hand it in. Did you hear his complaint? lt was the 13th. l'm sorry. l was really upset when l heard. -l went to the hospital. -Then you admit it. ls this the medical examiner's report? lt is the hospital report that we took to the medical examiner. Four and half months, male. Please explain. l accept that l was a bit rough. By rough you mean you pushed her? No. l tried to get her out of my house. Be clear. Your charge is murder. lt was 19 weeks old. A full human being. l didn't intend to push her. l wanted her to leave so l could close the door. -You didn't push me? -Ma'am, please. lf l knew she were pregnant, l wouldn't even have tried to get her out of the house. l just wanted to close the door. Do you accept his explanation? He didn't push. He grabbed me here and threw me and l fell on the stairs. l didn't throw you. l wanted to get you out of my house. -Who throws out a pregnant woman? -l didn't know. Why are you lying? l found out in the hospital. Your Honor, can't everyone tell from the body of a woman that she is pregnant? Four to five months pregnant. When would l even see you? l was already gone or leaving when she'd come. When l'd come, she looked like this. Always with the chador. How can anyone tell she was pregnant? He can claim that he couldn't guess. l didn't think a pregnant woman would come for this kind of work. Your Honor, l spoke of my pregnancy in front of him, his daughter and her tutor. They all heard it. When? l don't remember. No, of course you wouldn't remember. The issue isn't that l knew or not. Yes. lf it's proven that you knew, the court can request a prison term of one to three years. -Well? -What? No, l didn't know. His daughter's tutor can testify. Can she come in tomorrow? l don't want her or the school involved. lt's not good for my daughter. You trash. You've killed my child. lt's bad for your child? She matters but ours was an animal? -Don't insult... -Am l insulting? He took my pregnant wife... Quiet or l'll put you in prison. Please, he's a bit hot-tempered. Hot-tempered? l should sue you for working for a single man we don't even know. l wanted to help with the bills. He hasn't worked for months. The tutor has to come in as a witness. Call her to come in tomorrow. Your Honor, l'm here today for one thing. l lost my child but it didn't hurt as much as when he accused me of being a thief. We're thieves? lf we were thieves, we wouldn't come to wipe your father's ass. Do you have proof that she stole? l didn't say she stole. Money was missing and it was the same amount that l pay her. ls that why you fought? He accused her of stealing. Your Honor, my father has Alzheimer's. She tied his hand to the bed and left the house. That day l came home early. l saw him on the floor with his hand tied. l thought he had died. She came back and l'm not saying l wasn't angry, l was. l told her to leave and she wouldn't. Where should l have gone? He accused me of stealing. lf l hadn't asked for the money and left, he would've thought l had stolen. Sit down. -Was your father hurt? -Yes, he was. How hurt? lf he had been, he would've filed a complaint. Yes, he was hurt. Where are you going? l'm going to check on my child. Come back quick. Close the door. What's taking so long? l'm not well. You go, l'll come. He says you locked up his father and left. What should l say? Say? lf he complains you'll be charged. Where's Somayeh? Over there. Go. l'll get her and come. Let's go. Yes? He was sleeping. l locked the door to keep him in. Even he would lock the door and leave me the key. l saw that he does it so l... He says you tied him to the bed. l was afraid he would wake up and do something to himself. l was afraid for him. Why did you leave? -So you should hit her? -Quiet! Who said you could touch my wife? Sir, get out. They don't care about honor, l do. -Don't be offensive. -Leave the room. l want to file a complaint against this woman. Write your complaint. Take your father to the medical examiner. lf he's hurt get a report. What happens to our complaint? Sign this and leave. You have to post bail. What for? You're charged with murder. l can't let you leave. The blood money is 40 million. How am l going to post bail? l live at my dad's. He has Alzheimer's. lf you don't you'll go to jail. My father can't even come here. He's sick. Please don't. l can't go to jail. l've left him at home to come here. l can't go to jail. l can't post bail. lt's not in my hands. lt's the law. Wait one second. What should l do with my dad? l left him at home and locked the door to come here. My child will come home from school. Please. What are you writing? Don't waste time. Go make your call. l can't go to jail. l won't go. Write what you want! Go get an officer. What for? Don't. l'm begging you. Please don't write it. My life will be ruined. Don't waste time. Go make your call. Hello, Termeh. I'm stuck here. They're keeping me tonight. Don't worry. It's nothing. But you'll be alone tonight. Take care of the house. Take Grandpa to the bathroom regularly. Take care of yourself. I'll call you tomorrow. lf you hadn't left, Dad wouldn't be in jail. Your dad's not in jail because of me. He hit a pregnant woman. She came 'cause you left. How upset he was that l left. He knew you weren't really leaving. Did you tell him? No, he knew. Tell me the truth. You told him? Get your stuff. We're going to Grandma's. What about Grandpa? We'll take him, too. l have homework. l'm not coming. -You'll be on your own... -Fine. You'd better not call. He doesn't even ask me to stay. He doesn't refuse to divorce. After having lived together for 1 4 years. Dad! What are you doing here? Who are you with? Didn't you have an exam? No, it's tomorrow. Who are you with? Hello. Shouldn't you tell us you're in trouble so we can bail you out? l didn't want to trouble you. Silly man. -Sit. -No, ma'am, he has a hearing. Where's Grandpa? He's safe. What are they saying? ''My child'' as if their 18-year old son was stabbed to death. Did you speak to them? You can't even speak to the man. l told the wife, ''You're young. ''You can try next year.'' What happened? -l have to appraise the house. -Okay, go. Hi. -l'll be back. -We'll be here. Thanks. -Hi, Mrs. Lavasani. -Hi, how are you? Good, you? -Sorry we're troubling you. -No, what trouble? ls it true what they're saying? Yes, unfortunately he pushed her and she fell and lost her baby. So what should l tell them? l don't know what they'll ask. What if he asks something to his disadvantage? l think you should tell the truth. Please don't stand there. Where was he? Mr. Lavasani was in the kitchen. He didn't have a reaction to your conversation? lf he did l didn't notice. How did you realize she was pregnant? l think she told me. You asked. Why should l tell you? Her daughter was drawing a man and a woman. She said this is my mommy and daddy. l said your mommy's not that fat. She said she was pregnant. So it wasn't from her appearance? No. Why are you lying? You're a woman. You can't tell if a woman is pregnant? Even if l could tell, what difference does it make for Mr. Lavasani? This woman is his daughter's tutor. They've fixed their story. Why are you insulting this lady? No one's talking to you. When did l have the opportunity to fix my story? l was here last night. One thing is clear. Now that we are speaking, that man over there can hear us, can't he? l didn't hear you. My mind is on other things. Why would l listen to your conversation? Do l have to swear to God? Like you believe in God! No, God is for your type only! Open that window. He is an honorable man. l've been going there for a year to teach his daughter. He's not like that. Why should she hide her pregnancy? lf l knew l wouldn't have hired her. Why did you hire her without her husband's permission? Thank you. You may go. Thank you. ''During the Sassanid period, people were divided into two classes, ''the royalty, ''the upper class and the normal people.'' ''The ordinary people.'' What did they ask you? Whether your dad knew she was pregnant. Forgive us for taking your time. There's nothing to forgive. Sweetie, how did mommy lose her baby? She got a tummy ache. Why? Did Daddy fight with her? Why should he fight with her? Maybe because she didn't tell him she was working in people's homes? -Did he hit her? -My mom and dad never fight. Then why were they fighting in your drawing that day? You showed me. They don't fight anymore. No? You're sure? Yesterday he said he didn't know she was pregnant. Now he says he didn't push her. And you just stand there in silence! Honestly, didn't you push me? -l didn't say l... -Listen... Don't repeat everything. How far is the door from the stairs? 2 meters? What else can have happened to her? The corridor in our house... -Look... -l am talking! Don't talk. Just answer. Quiet! You've come here to answer. l've a question for you to answer. l want to ask him... Ask me. lf you hadn't done anything wrong, why'd you come to the hospital to see what was wrong with her? l came out of decency. Where was your decency when you hit her? Was anyone there during the fight? Their neighbor was there. l'll order questionings. They're in it too just like the teacher. He's been insulting me from the start! Am l lying? l'll determine who's lying or not. You be quiet. Sir, do you realize his ex-wife has posted his bail? Oh, my God! Can someone vouch for you? What do you mean? A government employee or business-owner to vouch for you. -No one. -Why vouch? Because she's been accused. Accused of what? According to the complaint he filed... Which he had no right... She admitted that she tied his father to the bed and locked him up. l explained to you why. Her child just died. Keep your voice down. Aren't you ashamed? You call yourself a man? l said quiet. For God's sake, listen to us for a change. He is twisting everything. He beat my wife and she had a miscarriage. What could be clearer? Why are you being unjust? Listen to us for a change. lf you disturb the peace, l'll send you to jail for three days. l've lost everything. You think l fear jail? You should fear God. Mr. lzadi, call an officer to arrest him. Sir, for the sake of the Quran, don't. -No, let them come and take me. -Go out. Be quiet. Why be quiet? So they can trample my rights? Go out. -Fine, l'm leaving. -Sir, come out. Let me get my helmet. Get out. l worked for ten years with a cobbler. They fired me and said get justice if you can. l sued and went back and forth for a year. ln the end, nothing. They said go sit at home. But this time l won't let it go. This time it's different. l have nothing to lose. The problem is l can't talk like this guy. l am hot-tempered. Don't! Hojjat? l don't feel well. Go sit there. Let's go! -What do you want? He's calm. -l have to take him. l'm going to talk to the judge. Stay there and don't move. Sir... l beg you... Please let me speak. Sir, he's stressed out. l've been patient for the past two days. l swear, he's been in and out of prison the past month. His creditors put him in prison. l begged them to let him come out. l beg you to forgive him. Sir, look. Look at these. Sir, can l ask you to please forgive him this time? Sir, every day he has to take these. l swear l'm not lying. Sir, since he was fired, he's been depressed. He can't help it. Sir, you're his elder. Please forgive him. Go tell him to find someone to vouch for you. God bless you. Don't leave the building. No, l'll wait for him to come back. Will you ask her? She'll think it's 'cause she bailed me out. So let her... Dad... Please. Okay. Promise. Why do you promise? Dad... Yes? You didn't know Razieh was pregnant? No. Why? Nothing. So why did you ask? Last night, Mom said you knew. Where was she to see if l knew? She said when you were told that Razieh's baby had died, you didn't say anything. You didn't ask if she was pregnant. You didn't get surprised. At times like this, people usually ask if she was carrying a child. lt was like you knew. Your mom wants to turn you against me. Will you ask her? l can't. Didn't you promise? l'm sorry. Which step was she on? This one. -This? -This one. Take Grandpa in. l'll be right back. -Are you mad at me? -No. You went upstairs? Yes, l went to see Mrs. Kalani. What for? l told her they are coming to investigate. To beware. Beware of what? Beware of... That they are coming to investigate. ls that not okay? lf she is to tell the truth, why should she beware? -Termeh... -Yes? Come with me. -l have homework. -Leave it for now. Look, imagine that l am her. ls this right? When someone is thrown they'll fall straight. They don't hit here and bounce off and hit here and then turn and hit here and fall here. Right? lf l'd thrown her from there, she should've fallen there on those steps or she would fall straight on the railing. She wouldn't fall like this. lmagine you were thrown. Follow the direction. -Then how had she fallen there? -l don't know. l'm just saying she wasn't thrown on these steps. Come and stand here. -Why don't you tell them? -Forget them. l want you to know. Go on. Did he throw you in this direction? No, towards the lower level. You look. This door doesn't allow me to even if l want to. lt's not possible. Where did you fall down? -On these stairs. -Which step? l think it was this one. You think or you're sure? l'm not sure. Ma'am, this is where you found her? l didn't see her fall. When l got here, she was on that lower step. Why don't you say anything? Go show them how he threw you. l was so sick l didn't know what happened to me. Look, l'll stand in her place. You in the doorway and push me as hard as you want. l'm saying it's not possible to fall there. Of course you won't fall. A pregnant woman falls easily. Then you come here. You choose who pushes you. l'm saying it's not possible. l'm saying if you push from here, she won't fall on the stairs. What stairs? She says she fell on that step up there. They all say they saw her on that one. Ma'am, did you see her get thrown? From up there l couldn't see the door, but l saw the stairs when she fell. Can you show me where you were? Maybe she got dizzy and fell. How often did you use these stairs? Why hadn't she gotten dizzy? Excuse me. That morning when l saw her here l asked her why there was garbage on the steps. She said she had gotten dizzy and dropped the bag. Right? -She took the garbage down. -You told me you got dizzy. Mrs. Kalani, hadn't she mopped the stairs that day? The stairs were wet. Maybe she slipped. You jerk! You made her slip. Be respectful! l'm polite in front of your family. You'd better be polite, you shit! Don't cuss. Take him outside. Would his neighbors say anything against him? lf you can prove they're lying... So you think they're telling the truth? To hell with me for wasting my time here. Excuse me. Give us her backpack. Here it is... Don't you want your drawing book? Sweetie, don't be upset that l am fighting with your mom and dad... Let me put it in your bag. My mommy didn't take your money. l know. That's not why l was fighting with her. Then for what? l was upset because she left my dad. She went to the doctor's. Go on. Take care. According to the court's request, l'll examine him and write what l see. Well, Doctor, you can see he doesn't talk anymore. Didn't you say he has Alzheimer's? Yes, but before this happened, he would speak a bit. This is a doctor's office. Prove that in court. Does he have any bruising? Yes, some. What happened? l'm not sure the bruising has to do with when he fell off the bed. Don't run. Mom, pull the window down. They're fighting. Don't you see this is a girls' school? l just have one question for this lady. You're not allowed to stand here. Take your fight to the police. l don't want to fight. l just want to speak to her. l have nothing to say to you. l don't know you or her husband. -Then why did you lie in court? -What lie? She knows what lie. Ms. Safaei, call the police. Don't scare me with the police. She's not involved. Then why does she try to get my daughter to speak? l did no such thing. You are a teacher. Aren't you ashamed? Why did you ask her if l hit her mom and she lost the baby? l never did. You pick on a 4-year-old's drawing and tell her her dad hit her mom and she lost the baby? l didn't say that! Why do you think we beat our wives and children like animals? l swear on this Quran, we're humans just like you. l have nothing to lose. Tell your husband not to make me do something crazy. l'll wait by the door. l'm unemployed. l'll stand out there all day. Eventually you'll come out. Come to the court and say you lied or l'll get to the bottom of what's between you and her husband. Shame on you. l've been patient so far. So why are you defending him? l told the truth. -The truth? -Yes! Place your hand on this and swear. Why swear? What does this have to do with her? l'm not scared. What do l have to say? You said her husband didn't know my wife was pregnant. -Yes. -Swear it. l swear on this Quran that day at their house, her husband was in the kitchen and didn't hear what your wife and l said. Okay? Anything else l should say? He's crazy. Call your husband. Don't go alone. No, l don't want him to know. l'm sorry. Why are you all standing here? Hello? Hello, Ms. Qahraei. l had left you a message. Can you please pick up? The lady that took care of my dad, apparently that day you gave her the number for a gynecologist. l wanted to ask you for that number to call and see if she went to see the doctor that week and what her problem was. l would appreciate you calling me back. Thank you. What do you want to do? With what? You want to keep this up? Every day a new fight? Why? What happened? He went to her school today and embarrassed her in front of everyone. What did he say? He screamed, ''Her dad killed my child.'' How can she go back to that school? Do you know what you are doing? What l am doing? He's making threats. He wouldn't dare! Termeh, go to your room. What if he kills your child on her way to school? What do you want me to do? Run off abroad with you? To hell with abroad. Why can't you talk normally? This is about Termeh and the situation you've put her in. l've put her in? You have some nerve accusing me! Who left home? Who filed for a divorce? You said leave whenever you want. Why did you come back? l didn't. l'm here because of her situation. Her situation's fine. -You have two choices... -Don't try to intimidate me. What intimidation? Either you clear up the situation... -No, l know what to do. -Didn't you hit her? Didn't she fall? Didn't her baby die? Yes! l killed her child. Why are you so stubborn? Pay the blood money and end it. -l won't be forced into paying. -Why forced? Put yourself in their place. -l'm not responsible for their troubles. -Their child died! And my dad has been hurt. He doesn't even speak anymore. He didn't speak much before. l was happy with the few words he spoke. ls it as bad as losing a baby? Where were you to see l caused it? -Then how did she lose it? -l don't know. There might be a chance that her husband did something and now she wants to blame me. Her child said that day she had gone to the doctor. Why couldn't she wait two hours to go to the doctor? Why did she tie the old man to his bed and leave? The examiner said her child died due to a blow. How do we know it was a blow from me? l won't accept it till it's been proven to me. Fine, let me take Termeh. Shame on you for putting pressure on me now. l am worried about her. Your child wants to live here. She has to stay here and learn. Learn what? Fighting and obstinacy? To learn not to be a coward like you who gives in so easily. He knows who to frighten. Why doesn't he threaten me? Yes, l'm a coward. Your whole life, instead of solving problems, you've either run away or raised your hands and given in. Just say why you want to leave this country. You're afraid to stay. l was gone one week and you couldn't manage. l couldn't manage and l'm responsible. Give me Termeh and you do what you want. Termeh, sweetie, you don't have to stay. Go wherever you like. You still don't want to come? ''He sells it for 20 a kilo. ''lf every day he sells 270 kilos...'' Write 270. Then, how much profit does he make in one day? How do you solve this? Did you lie? What? Did you lie? About what? When you said you didn't know she was pregnant. Why? You said that you didn't hear Ms. Qahraei and Razieh speaking. Yes. Then how did you know that Ms. Qahraei gave her the number? Didn't she say it at the same time? Okay. lf we want to calculate the profit... Yes, l knew. Your mom was telling the truth. When they were talking in the hall, l heard everything from the kitchen. Then why did you say you didn't? Do you know what would happen if l said l knew? One and a half to three years in prison. l only thought of what would happen to you, who you'd stay with. l said l didn't know. lf you knew, why did you hit her? l knew she was pregnant but at that moment l didn't. l had forgotten it. l wasn't paying attention. So tell them this. The law doesn't care about this. Either l knew or l didn't... Look at me. lf you want me to l'll tell them. Hi. Didn't l say not to come to the front? Ms. Qahraei! What are you doing? Ms. Qahraei, wait... lf you pull over l'll just explain something to you. Please let me... Dad! Who's responsible for my child's safety now? Without a witness there's no case. So without a witness l should wait for him to kill her and then come to you? How should l know you are telling the truth? Why should l lie? Bring my daughter and father here just to lie? -ls she here now? -Yes, outside. Ask her yourself. l'm afraid to leave her at school. l'm afraid to leave my dad at home. ls the plaintiff here? Did you finish writing? Almost. You didn't know his wife was pregnant? No, l didn't. When she was speaking to the tutor, you didn't hear them? No, l didn't. You didn't, huh? What l'm saying is... The tutor came and revoked her testimony. She says you knew. -She said l knew? -Yes, she came yesterday. He threatened her... Answer me. Did you hear her or not? l said no. How did you know about the doctor's number? My daughter told me. What did she tell you? That she got the number from her teacher. Go tell her to come in. Now? And wait outside. What question? What does he want to ask? l don't know. Give me that. So what do you have to say? You haven't asked me anything. Didn't your dad tell you what l want to ask you? No. What grade are you in school? Sixth. The day your tutor came to your house and asked the lady about her pregnancy, were you there? Not then, l had gone to get my books. Then how did you know she got the doctor's number from your tutor? She gave her the number later, when she was leaving. ln front of you? Yes. Why didn't you tell your dad sooner? What? That she got the doctor's number from your tutor. l didn't think it was important for my dad to know. And did you tell your dad or did he hear it? That she gave the number? l told him. -You told him? -Yes. Okay. What crime did l commit? Nothing. You're right. He's not accepting his responsibility. l admit that he's to blame, but in the end what will happen? One or two years in court for a payment plan of the blood money. But why? That's what upsets me. Why do you think it's for the money? When did l say such a thing? You think l am a bum and my kid died and l don't understand anything. l never said anything like that. Let's see what she's saying. There's no other way. Your child won't come back. My husband won't get hanged. Her husband didn't do it on purpose. They're good people for giving you a solution. Take the money and settle it. You can use it in your situation. Right now we'll decide on an amount and l'll get my husband's approval. Now we have to get his approval? For God's sake leave us alone. You act like you don't need the money. Take a look at yourself. Don't let him go. Wait a second. l want to talk to you. Will you stay? Mom... Let me speak to him. Come sit. l want to talk to you. l can hear you. l went and spoke to her husband today. Sit down. l managed to get him to agree to take 15 million instead of 40 million. Three five-million checks in exchange for his consent. How dare you speak to him about money? l can't handle the stress of my child's safety. You don't get it. Just now when you were late, l was worried sick. Why are you interfering? l didn't come here to fight. Oh, God, why can't l make her understand? Didn't you say it was my fault, that l introduced her, that if l hadn't left, none of this would've happened? So let me fix it, then. lf l pay, it means l have accepted it was my fault. But he has consented. He won't let us be. -He won't, anyway. -Why should l bribe him? Think of it as my dower money. lf l had to l would beg and borrow to get your dower money. But l don't have the money to pay for extortion. Our child is going through adolescence. She is suffering. So you understand the sensitivity of her adolescence. lf she was suffering she wouldn't have stayed. Why do you think she stayed? Did she choose you? To keep us from separating. She knows l won't go anywhere without her. She is suffering but she doesn't show it. Call them now and say l won't pay until it's been proved to me that l am responsible. l'll sell my car. Don't sell it for my sake. lt's not for you. lf your child is not worth... Why are you talking nonsense? Money's not the issue. l won't rest till my child's safety is guaranteed. You don't have the right to do anything. Understand? lf l had done nothing you would be in prison. Come to court and get back the bail. l don't want to be out because of it. Get up, Termeh. Get up, let's go. Get up, l tell you. Mom, please. l don't want you to stay here. No, Mom, l won't let you. ls 15 million more important than your child's life? l won't let you do this. lf your child is not important... Mom, please listen, why are you doing this? You said you would stay. l was stupid! Mom, please... l'll wait in the car. Go there for a few days till your exams are finished. Your grandparents are there. You'll have more fun. Didn't you say it's not serious? lt got serious. Termeh... Honey... lf you cry l'll cry, too. Why won't you pay them so she'll come back? This has nothing to do with her coming back. lt does. She had come to stay. Her stuff was in the car, l saw it. lf you think l am guilty, go get your mom. We'll call them and go pay them. l have doubts. Didn't he throw you? Yes. Did something happen at home? No. Even before, my child wasn't moving. Before he threw you? You mean your child had already died? l don't know. Maybe. Had something happened? l'm not sure, but the night before, l had pain. -Have you ever lost a baby before? -No. l was hit by a car. Your father-in-law had gone into the street. l went after him. He was crossing the street to come back. l ran to stop him but l got hit instead. The pain started that night. Does your husband know this? Why don't you come say this in court? My husband will kill me if he finds out l told you this. Since yesterday when he promised his creditors, he's been waiting. What do we have to do with all this? lt's my fault. Yesterday when he said you'd promised him this money, l got really scared. l called a few people. They say if l have doubts then it's a sin to take it. lf we don't pay my husband's innocence must be proved. l made you swear not to repeat any of this! But your husband won't leave us alone. l fear for my child. l'm afraid that if l take this money, something will happen to my child. What do you want me to do? Don't pay this money. Don't. Will your husband leave us alone? Give me that. Bring some plates. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. When you revoke your complaint, we'll give you these three checks. God bless you. Hojjat, get a pen and paper so we can write everything down and sign it. l want to say something first... Say a prayer and finish it. l have already agreed and will honor my word. l just want his wife and my daughter to be here when l speak. Where is she? Thank you. Please, also call my daughter. Come in. Your father wants you. Termeh, come and sit here. Excuse me, sir. Look... l wrote the checks and l'll give them to you. There's no problem. l need to ask a favor. Ma'am, you are a devout person. Swear on the Quran that l caused your miscarriage. Bring a Quran. Go get it. Come quickly or they'll suspect something. His creditors are here for the money. You'll ruin our reputation. l won't swear. Didn't you say you went to get his father and a car hit you? Why aren't you coming? She's afraid to swear. Why? l... l have doubts. Oh, God... Azam, go sit with them. Why are you saying this now? l swear l told Azam. Tell me exactly what happened. The day before, a car hit me. And that night l had a lot of pain. -Let's go, it'll be my sin. -No. lt's a sin. l asked. What sin? He's consented. Let's go. l am scared we'll be punished. More punished than this? Look at my situation. Have mercy on me. On our child. l'm afraid of something happening to our child. Let's go. l can't. Let's go. l can't. Don't hit yourself! Why did you come here tonight? Didn't l tell you not to come? Didn't l say we don't want your money? How will l live in this house? Why did you do this to me? Come on. Let's go. Hello. Come in. So what's your decision? Your parents have left it up to you to decide who you want to live with. With your father or your mother? Have you decided? Yes. -Have you? -Yes. Have you decided or not? Yes. And what is it? Do l have to say it now? -lf you haven't decided... -Yes, l have. -lf you haven't decided yet... -l have. And? Would you prefer them to wait outside? Can they? Sir, wait outside for a minute. You, too, ma'am.
