Nice place. I'm house-sitting. For a friend. They don't mind I smoke, do they? I don't think she'll care. How long have you been hitching? Not very long. I haven't had much luck, honestly. People aren't as trusting these days. Do you have any family in the area? What, um... what do you want from me? How do you mean? It's just that most people don't usually help out unless they want something in return, you know. I'm not like most people. Besides, I think it's important that we all help each other out, especially, these days. You're very beautiful. That's very kind of you to say, Raymond. Uh, everyone calls me Ray. All right. Ray. How long have you been using? It's okay. I'm not judging you in any way. I watched my brother battle with it. You remind me of him... ...in a way. I'm... I'm trying to kick it, you know. It's very difficult. You shouldn't beat yourself up about it. Life can be brutal, and we all need something to relieve the pain from time to time. How long has it been since your last fix? About 30 hours or so. I just scored right before you picked me up. Well, you can't kick it cold turkey, it isn't safe. Let me help you. It's fine. I can do it. No, I had to help my brother countless times. Really, it's okay. Poor baby, you're shaking. You don't wanna blow out a vein or get cotton fever, do you? Where's your gear? It's fine, sweetheart. I'll get you a bucket, just in case. Hey... It's okay. It's okay. It is funny, isn't it? You little beast. You look like an animal. You're hardly a man. I could smell your weakness from miles away. From the moment I saw you, I knew. You should consider yourself lucky to have survived the birth canal. Hey, guys, it's Savanna. Thanks for coming back to my vlog. Uh, I have a little bit of a treat for you guys today. I decided to take a little, like, mini day trip outside of the city because it's so beautiful outside. And I found this really state grip. Hey, guys, it's Savanna! Uh, thanks for tuning back into my vlog. I... All right, Savanna, let's get started. Uh, just turn to the side like this... Hand on your hip. Look off over there. Great. Now, big smile. Wonderful. Look into the camera. Okay. Now, turn around to the back wall. Now look at me. Hold it, just like that. And beautiful! Nick should be here soon. Okay, no worries. I really love your channel. Your content is amazing. Oh, thanks. You've lost so much weight. What's your secret? I'm just really poor. I live out of my car. You're hilarious. Sorry, I'm late. Oh, yeah, no worries. So, we love your channel. You have excellent engagement, and your base is growing rapidly. Frankly, you have the kind of numbers we'd like to see in a vlog like yours. This kind of... free-spirited travel image with a down-home vibe. Farm girl goes to the city. Thank you, Shelby. Fucking farm girl goes to the city. We can work with that. If I'm being honest, something about you just doesn't seem right, Savanna. And I don't buy this whole doe-eyed act one bit. I think you're better than that. Do me a favor. Stand up. Turn around. Not bad. Shelby, what do you think? She's gorgeous. Thank you! Listen, travel's big right now, certainly. But there's a lot of opportunity for someone willing to take advantage of it. Culinary, cannabis, e-sports, makeup tutorials... ASMR's big now. Fuckin' weird. But very profitable. For the time being, at least. Well, I'd really like to focus on travel. It's my passion. And I think that I can bring something a little... Savanna, please spare me. Are you interested in anything outside of new media, film, television, commercials? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, absolutely. Good. There's a casting call I'd like for you to go to in a few days. I think you would be perfect for the role. Well, we feel great about this. And I hope you do, too. We'll draw up the contracts and do our due diligence. Savanna... you already have it inside of you. We can make you into a monster, if we all pull together... ...as a team. How have you been, Savanna? I've been doing very well, Mother. It's great to hear. I'm the happiest I've ever been. It's truly a blessing. Wonderful. I'm sure you want to hear what's making my outlook so optimistic. Very much so. My channel has expanded quite a bit since you last saw it. Fantastic. I recently got accepted by a prestigious agency that handles new media. Crafted a five-year plan that's very comprehensive. Have they put together a press kit to attract ad revenue? They're putting it together presently. - My other good news... - How long could it possibly take? I certainly hope you weighed your options before hopping into bed with the first agency that paid you any attention. You always were a needy child. They need time to process the contracts. Like I said, they're very prestigious. But the other thing I want to tell you... It just doesn't make sense. If you're this rising star, then they should be waiting on your hand and foot. It's a very competitive industry, Mother. I did my due diligence. I met a man. Is he decent? He's very nice. And he treats me really well. I consider myself lucky. He's a lawyer, just passed the bar. Are you sure you can trust a lawyer? Long hours? I'm sure a great deal of them are unfaithful. And after all, what's was one more lie when you've made dishonesty your occupation. I would be concerned about the impact if you anticipate children... That is, of course, if you're able to conceive. We hope to have children once we're both financially stable. Do you think you'd make a fit mother, Savanna? I think you'll make a wonderful grandmother. I hope you both got tested for STDs. If you are going to try and have a child, at least get a DNA screening. There's no use procreating, if you're evolutionarily incompatible. To do so knowingly would almost be cruel. Don't you agree? Yes, Mother. Good. I can't wait for you to meet him. How soon can you bring him around? Very soon. You'll love him. I'm sure of it. I'm glad to see that you're doing so well, Savanna. Yes, and it's good to see you after so long. I believe what you and father did was absolutely necessary to get my life on track. No, we didn't want to put you out on the street, Savanna. But it was what we needed to do, to force you to take responsibility for your actions. You're absolutely right. So... is there anything that I can do for you? I hesitate to ask. I know you and father had a very strict rule about assisting able-bodied adults. Your father was always too keen on breaking that rule, but it would be cruel of me to mold you into a weak person, correct? Yes. What is it that you need, Savanna? We're having a little difficult to getting into an apartment. He's about to start working for a very respectable firm. But right now, we're a little low on funds on account of us not having settled into our new lives together. We just need a little assistance, with a deposit and some essentials to help us get through this awkward patch. One could say that your life has been a never-ending series of awkward patches, missed opportunities, squandered advantages. What fiscal sense would it make for me to continue to invest in you? Hm? Because that is what you're asking me to do, right? You're capable of at least that much intelligence. Yes, Mother. You and father were so generous. I should have been more grateful... For years, we paid for specialist after specialist wasting thousands on what'll boil down to nothing more than daydreams and night terrors... My visions were real, but I'm much better now, Mother. If you ask me, we're as much to blame as you. We coddled your weaknesses and we amplified them. We told you that you could be anything you wanted to be because we were too afraid to say the truth. You were never going to amount to very much at all. It was practically written in stone from the day you turned four-years-old. You're right, Mother. I shouldn't have been so selfish. I was never sick. It was all in my head. And you have the nerve to come here and ask me for my hard-earned money because you're too weak to go out and earn it yourself. And, yet, you enter your mother's house, and you neglect to greet her in the proper manner. I'll give you the money, sweetheart, but it'll be the last time. Maybe you found some new career flaunting yourself on the Internet. Maybe you haven't. But I do know that you're lying about having a good man. Because what good man could possibly love such an ugly, unintelligent whore. Remember what I always told you... When counting your blessings... ...always consider yourself lucky to have survived the birth canal. "I don't know what they're talking... I don't know what they're talking about, baby. You... You have to believe me. Please, baby, I don't... I don't know what they're... I don't know what they're talking about, baby. You have to believe me. Please, baby. Please, baby, you have to believe me. I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know what they're talking about, baby. You have to have to believe... You have to believe me. I don't know what they're talking about, baby. You have to believe me." Hello. - Excuse me. - Yes. I'm here for the casting call. Uh, what's your name? Savanna. I have, like, five Savannas. - Savanna Mills. - Down the hall, to the right. Great. Thanks. Can you please not slam the door? - Hello? - Hey, Savanna. Are you all right? Yeah, absolutely. Savanna, I just got off a very strange call with the casting director. Did you just leave the audition screaming? What? No, no, No, no, no. I... I just told the receptionist that I had to get something out of my car. Um, I must have said it kind of loudly, so, maybe, he thought I was screaming. All right. Uh, well... Could you come in Monday morning at 10:00? Yeah. Why? What's up? We did a routine background check. It's nothing too serious. We just like to have, uh, thorough meeting with our clients when there's a history of mental health issues, just to make sure we're all on the same page going forward. Yeah. It's, um... it's actually a really silly story when you hear it, but, um, I totally understand. Oh, and... Um, I was thinking about what we talked about me branching out and doing different things with my channel, and, um, I've already recorded so many videos. Um, I... I can't wait for you guys to see them. Okay. See you Monday, Savanna. Yeah. Looking forward... So, to complete your daytime, look, take a lip color that's slightly darker than your natural lip tone. That's what I like to do, um, because we're doing a day time look, you don't need anything too dramatic. So we're just gonna take it and pat it on really, really softly, 'cause you don't need a lot. You're gonna take my... Again? Man, even when they just see the police they know they're going to jail Now, again. Whoa. Another one. - Another one? - Aw. Here's another... Here's a meteor. Yeah! No. You g uys are such drama queens. Can I help it if people are crazy? These types of murders happen all the time. These things must be done delicately, or you'll hurt the spell. Please be careful. This ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe, of known scientific reality. Hi, I'm Savanna. It's nice to meet you. Oh, my God. What did he say? I love you... so much. Hi, I'm Savanna. It's nice to meet you. Hotel maintenance. Time to go. You staying another night? Damn, girl. You aren't like most ladies, are you? Nah, uh-uh. Most, by now, kicking, screaming, whooping and hollering. Begging and pleading. But you? You haven't said a goddamn word. No, you're not like most. Tell you what. You see a lot of low-down dirty shit. Working as a night manager at a sleepy old motel. But never have I seen a room in the state that yours was in this morning. No. Now that, darling, is what we call a really fucking mess. Uh, you don't have to talk if you don't want to, sugar. Makes no "never mind" to me. Either way, me and you're gonna have us a real good time. Please. Sir, please. Please. Please just let me go. I... I won't tell anyone. You don't have to do this. Don't fucking lie to me, bitch. I'm not your daddy. That shit's not gonna fly here. Please. I don't know what you're talking about. Have you got shit in your ears, sweetheart? I went to your fucking room this morning. I've seen the boy. And I've seen what you did with his blood. I know exactly what you are. You're just like me. I'll tell you what. Keep you quiet for a minute. Yeah, that's a good girl. Comfortable? Hey, motherfucker. The fuck are you doing in my goddamn pay booth? Are you Virgil Caine? Yeah. Last time I fucking checked. So is the name on the deed of this private residence. Now, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm Detective Gonzalez. Just noticed your door was open, and I... You think you can just walk in if the door is unlocked, huh? What can I do for you, officer? Sir, there's been several reports of missing women in this area. We're just going door to door hoping somebody's seen... - ...something. - No. I haven't. - No, sir, however you want to... - Look... if you do see something out of the ordinary, - just give us a call. - Amen, brother. Now, could you kindly get the fuck off my property? Thank you, sweetheart for staying so goddamn quiet. - I think you're right. - What's that? About us being alike. Oh. We're both compelled to do horrific things. And if you're anything like me, there's... there's nothing you wouldn't do to be able to stop the urges. I found a cure. It's terrible, but I know it works. There was something rotten inside of me. But it's not there anymore. I can feel it. I see change, like a splinter has been removed from my soul. Right. My mother told me every child is born into God. Covered in the blood of the lamb. Thing is, some people's insides are just so nasty, so spoiled, that that blood clean slides off. Now. I've done a lot of bad things, sugarbear. I can't get the blood to stick neither. I ain't never killed no child. And that there is something you can't walk back. I don't consider my urges uh, an affliction. More of an unconventional vocation, as it were. I spend an hour or two with the whores I bring back here to my shop. And it's where I do the public a goddamn service. I mean, a man can take pride in the sweat of his brow, can't he? It's the only solace this world affords. Now, I reckon if what drives me and you is a malady. Then my work is the only tonic I require. Let's go ahead. Wait, wait, wait. - No, no, no, no, you don't have to do this. - Can't do. No, no. Yeah. Please. You don't have to do this. Please. Please! Please. Please. Oh, but I do, sweetheart, I really do. I enjoy this. Beg for me, baby girl, beg. - Please. Please! - Yeah! Please, just make it stop. Please. Yes. - You want me to make it stop? - Yes. I'll do anything. Yeah, that's what I like to hear. You'd do anything, huh? Yeah. That sounds interesting. Do anything? Anything I want? - Yeah. - No questions. No. Okay, sweetheart. Yes. So... what are you gonna do for me? Huh? I'll do anything. Anything? Yeah, yeah. - Hm. - Yeah. Call me your savior. - What? - You fucking heard me, bitch. You're my savior. I wanna worship you for the rest of my life. I'm... I'm nothing without you. Yeah. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it, Mama? No, it wasn't, Daddy. Quiet now. You can hear that beast moving inside your womb. What? Where... - Where am I... - It's all right. My name is Seth. This is my home. On the road here last night, I found you injured and in shock, practically walking in the middle of the road. You collapsed on the asphalt. From exhaustion, by the look of it. And, uh... Before you passed out, you made one simple request. So I honored your wish and brought you here. What did I say? No police. I had my personal physician tend to your wounds. - I... I don't know, I... - Savanna. This is unfortunate timing, really. As Dr. Bradford was tending to you last night, you woke at one point, started thrashing in a panic. He gave you a sedative and suggested you might not wake until this evening, so I scheduled my day accordingly. I can't stay any longer, but I won't be far. My team will be convening in the living room today. So if you need me, I'll be near. Doctor's on his way to look you over one last time. So make yourself at home and I look forward to speaking with you again. Hello, Savanna. I presume Mr. Campbell filled you in. Keep both eyes open wide for me, please. Follow the flashlight. All right. Let's take a look at that hand. It looks like your bandages will need changing tomorrow. Otherwise, how do you feel? Um, a little foggy. Well, there's no sign of a concussion. It's more likely from exhaustion. So get some rest. In a few days, I'll come by again and take a look at that hand. And when it's fully healed, I'll refer you to a very talented plastic surgeon who can certainly mitigate any scarring or discoloration. Everything is already taken care of by Mr. Campbell. Seth is a good man. You're lucky he found you. That man is Seth Campbell? Savanna, I can't say I know what you went through. I realize situations like this can be very sensitive. So, I'll just preface this by acknowledging that I am by no means a forensic scientist and this may come out of left field. When I arrived last night, by the placement and size of the wounds, the volume of blood on your clothing and body, well, I will say it looked like there was another party involved in whatever took place before you and Mr. Campbell crossed paths. - I... - It's all right. I don't require an explanation. All I will say is, whoever hurt you. well, I hope you gutted the bastard. No. No, it's not smooth enough. What don't you like about the new look? Not 100% intuitive. Okay. Maybe if you just a minute... Don't fucking argue with me about this, Bradley. Just do the job I paid you for. Can you do that? - Yeh, I'll... - Good. We'll just go back to the drawing board. So, if the design is good, I'll coordinate with China. No, Thomas, we're not good. You do realize that the production version would be much more polished, right? Does this look like something designed by Jony Ive, huh? Well, I'm not Jony Ive, Seth. No, the fuck you're not. We cannot settle for mediocrity. I want a chimera in every fucking home in the world. I want the UX to be so profound, so undeniably perfect that anyone who buys this is irreversibly altered. I want them to develop new fucking DNA because of this machine. If people are not completely obsessed with this box, we've failed. You will have failed me. All I ask is that you put in the same amount of effort that I do. That's it. If you're not with that, there's the fucking door. When Design and UI have their shit together, let me know so I can start selling this bitch, okay? Fuck you, Rachel. That's all for today. Mm. What is it? I've... I've just never had food this good before. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I mean, I've just been so busy lately. I barely have time to sit down for a proper meal. I can imagine. Your content is quite good. You've seen my channel? I'm a subscriber. Oh, my God. What? Well, I... You don't really imagine the owner of the platform watching when you upload a video. Oh, Savanna... we're always watching. Seriously, though, I think you're on a great path. Thanks. It doesn't always feel that way. You see the numbers and the comments, good and bad, but I'm still struggling just to get by. I've been telling the board for a year now that there's a hole in the profit-sharing program. It's all right. I don't mean to complain. Trust me, Savanna. I understand. You know, I still have no idea what happened last night, and you don't have to talk about it unless you want to. I just need some time. You know, I must say, and forgive me if this is too bold, but I really like you, Savanna. I don't think that's too bold at all. I'm not sure if you've read the tabloids over the past few years, but you probably know that my past relationships have never fared too well. Yeah, they're kind of hard to miss. I think the problem stems from the fact that I tend to be somewhat eccentric. It's just the way my brain is wired, you know. I can certainly empathize with that. I have certain wants and desires. I work in a very high-stress industry, and it can be quite overwhelming. You find that what works one day to relieve the tension doesn't always deliver the next day. It's a constantly evolving problem. Mm. Seth, you're a great man. You deserve whatever you desire. Well, thank you for saying that. But... For the most part, when I find myself becoming truly vulnerable, enough to be honest about what I really want, it tends to scare most people off. Well, I'm not like most people. Savanna... you have been a naughty, naughty girl. Hm? You think so? Mm-hm. You know what happens to naughty girls? Mm-mm. They get a little spanking. A little spanking. How's that feel, huh? You like that? Do you like that, Savanna? Mm-hm, mm-hm. - You do? - Mm-hm. Do you want it a little bit harder? - Do you? - Yeah. - You sure? - Uh-huh. Oh. How do you want it? You want it hard like that? Uh-huh. - Harder? - Uh-huh. Like that? Whoa. That make you cringe? Uh-huh. Well, it turns me on. You take that... that... You like that, huh? Ooh. You want some more? Uh-huh. - You do, huh? - Yeah. Big day? Yeah. Me too. Oh, yeah. Big things, baby. You want to get dinner tonight? After all the craziness? I have the appointment with the fertility doctor this afternoon, but it should be finished at a reasonable time. Hey, baby. I love you. It'll be okay. You good? It's good? Now connect to your core, to your center of power and relaxation. Your sukhasana. Inhale... and exhale. Wow! I am so excited for the premiere of this film. It looks fantastic. Savanna, tell us what was the most interesting thing or better yet, something you'll remember 20 years from now about the making of this film? Oh, gosh, um... I really don't know. Uh... There's just so many wonderful memories. Like working with the entire cast and crew was just incredible. And um, getting to work with a legend like Giorgio is still, like, just... surreal. Um... I feel... I feel extremely blessed. Now, I know we're here tonight to talk about Dark Feast, but everybody is dying to hear about the wedding. It's all boring, really. It's all boring stuff. Something I just wanna make sure it's a very intimate occasion. Well, I'd hardly call a guest list of 1,200 intimate. - Yeah, I suppose you're right. - Mm-hm. Um, we just feel very grateful to be surrounded by so many people who want to see us happy. I can imagine it's nice to have so many positive things happening in your life, especially after last year and the passing of your mother. - We're done. - What? Nick, can you make sure people read a fucking writer? Savanna, why... - Sava... - It's really fucking unprofessional. Savanna! Guys, will you just cut this part out. - Savanna, I'm sorry. - We're done. Nick? You told me everything was fair game. I thought it was. No, you have to move in from frame left. Hold him in third and push in slowly. It's not gonna cut if you keep moving in fast like that. Okay. Left. - Oh, my God. Abby! - Oh! There he is. Oh, I missed you so much. Seriously. It's been too long. My God. This place is massive. Come here. Give your suitcase to me. Give me that. No, no. Dad fell into the pit that you dug. My God, that's right. I forgot about that. He was so mad he took all your fucking books away. Yeah, I was halfway through The Philosopher's Stone at the time. That was devastating. You were hell to be around for weeks. - Oh, come on. I wasn't that bad. - Yeah. How long do you plan on staying with us? I don't know. I haven't really made a plan. Well, as usual, you can stay as long as you'd like. I don't want to impose. No, no, no, no. We'd love to have you. Oh, I was hoping you could spend the day with Abby since I have that product release to prepare for. Seth, I'm very busy, too. But I'm sure I could make some time. Opening is next weekend, but Chloe wanted you to have the space to yourself in case you wanted to acquire something before the rush. She's currently prepping for a dress rehearsal, so, came at the perfect time, really. - Thank you so much, Brea. - Mm-hm. That's really beautiful. Chloe says you should never call a piece beautiful. It's offensive. - Mourinho, right? - Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, tell me, how'd you meet Seth? So I was invited to tour the south campus of the company headquarters for a promotional event. And we were just meeting all the heads of the departments and about to leave the design wing when I turned a corner and Seth smashed right into me, spilling one of those uh, disgusting meal replacement shakes that he loves. Yeah, all over my dress. It was... it was a complete disaster. Um, we started trying to clean each other up, and I noticed who he was. And then he recognized me, which just blew my mind. Um... And uh, peak awkwardness, he asked me out to dinner. I said yes, and here we are. That's really sweet. Thanks. Yeah, we couldn't be happier. Yeah, and I'm sure it's been wonderful for your career. I'm sorry? Come on, Savanna. Let's just be honest with each other. We're gonna be sisters after all. Aren't we? Yeah, of course. Seth has enriched my life immensely, but he's also helped me grow so much as a person. I adore him completely, Abby. I want you to know that. That's good. I mean, imagine it'd be pretty awkward if you were engaged with someone you didn't care about very much, - wouldn't it? - All right, Abby... It really captured the essence of postmodern power dynamics. Am I right? Yeah, absolutely. This is my favorite. Chloe spent four months in Nepal fasting, meditating 18 hours a day, and at the peak moment of exhaustion and starvation, visual hallucinations started washing over her like waves. And it was in this moment of pure apotheosis that she conceived this piece. I consider it the apex of her oeuvre. Mm. It's not my favorite. Baby, it's all right. It's gonna be okay. I know how much this means to you and... I just love you so much. You were here when I needed someone. And we are stronger than ever. You know, the... the doctor said that there's still a chance. And if not, we can... we can always adopt. We're going to get through this. You know, maybe we should talk to Abby and tell her that right now just isn't a good time to have company. No. No, I need her here with me. I... I need Abby. Sorry it's late, but it's delicious. I'm excited. Seth mentioned it was your favorite. Thanks for cooking, Abby. I'm just glad my brother found a woman with such a good head on her shoulders. Ooh. That looks delicious. Please excuse me. Sweet baby. It's all right. It's okay. You'll get through this. Your mommy loves you so much. I just want you to know that I am here for you. Completely. There she is. We were worried about you last night. You feeling all right? Savanna. Am I not supposed to use those knives? I'll wash 'em if that's a problem. Baby. Baby, please. Please! Seth, it wasn't my fault. Seth, she attacked me. Please. Please, you have to believe me. Please. No! No! Please. Seth. She just lunged at me. I didn't know what to do. And I was on top of her, I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. Please! Seth, stop. Seth, stop. Seth. Seth, I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry. - No. I didn't mean for it to happen. Baby, I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know what I was doing. No, Seth, stop. Please, you have to listen to me. Look at me. You... you have to go away. No, no. You know me. Seth, you know me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. You know me. I didn't mean to do this. You killed my sister. I didn't mean to. She attacked me. Seth, I was defending myself. Please. I love you. I love you so much. Please listen to me. I'm so sorry. Please don't let me go. Please, please. You have to believe me, please. Baby. Seth, I can't go somewhere else. I can't start my life over again. Please. Please, please, Seth. You're everything to me. - Please, stop. - I have to go. No. No! Seth, stop. Look at me, please. Please. You know me. Seth, I love you so much. We have everything together. We were so good. We were so good. Baby, please. Baby, we're so good. - You killed Abby. - I didn't mean to. - You killed Abby! - She attacked me. She attacked me. Abby's not a violent person! She was unstable. I know it. Abby's not a violent person! She's not a violent person! I'm pregnant! She attacked me. I found out last night. I was defending... I was defending our baby. - I can't... - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Baby, yes you can. We're gonna have a baby. We're gonna have a baby. I love you. I love you so much. Hey, everybody. I know, I haven't made a personal post in, like, a really long time, But, um... I just wanted to be the first to let you all know that I'm officially back. There is just so much that I want to share with you all. And the first thing is how much I appreciate you. Um, I really can't do what I do without all of your love and all of your support. And um... I'm really excited for what's coming next.
