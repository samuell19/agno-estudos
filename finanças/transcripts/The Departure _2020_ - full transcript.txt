Like I said, this place isn't the tiptop, but it come pretty close. I mean, all the food's authentic, the staff is super friendly I've never had a bad experience here, so I hope you enjoy the spot. Yeah. Excuse me. Are you ready to order? - Um... - A couple of minutes, please. - Yeah, perfect. Take your time. - Thank you. It does seem like it's kind of a hidden gem. Oh, yeah, it certainly is. Cool. Um, what were you gonna get? Um... Well, I typically get the carbonara pasta. - It's got bits of bacon and the eggs. - Mmm. It's an Italian classic. What about you? What are you getting? Oh, sorry. Sorry. Um, that sounds good. I'm vegan, though, so I was actually thinking of the meatless lasagna. That's right. That must be difficult. Yeah. I mean, like, do you miss eating meat? - Hmm, sorry. - No, no. Um... Not at all. I've been vegan for like, nine years, so I don't really think about it anymore. I would never go back. I do admit though, - I still like the smell of meat. - Mmm-hmm. You know, especially bacon. Oh, hey, let me tell you. I hear you. I can't imagine a world without bacon. Really? You should try it sometime. You know, even just being vegan for like a month. I haven't been sick for like two years, and I swear it's because my diet. Really? Well, that's crazy. You know, doesn't it seem like every few years - there's like a new food topic trending. - Mmm. We had GMOs and then there was carbs and paleo and now the thing is like all meat is bad, even chicken. You know what am I supposed to eat? Just like fruits and vegetables? Uh... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure. Fruits and vegetables, though, maybe vegan's the way to go. You know, I'll think about it. Anyway, uh, I haven't had their meatless lasagna but I have had the regular one and it is bomb. All right, lasagna it is then. So, uh... What did you do today? Oh, sorry, sorry. Okay. I will not respond to any more texts. - No worries. - Um... Well, today's my day off so I mostly just slept all day. Nice. You know, I love sleeping, it's my favorite hobby. Yes, mine too. Really? You know, maybe we should collaborate again sometime. Mmm. Very funny. I think we've also already done that. It was a bad joke. What did you do today? Uh, let's see. Not much. I went to the gym, I did some laundry. Oh, I, uh, I saw a horror film. Oh, nice. Which one? Um... You know, I forget the name, but, uh, it's about this couple and they go out into the middle of nowhere - to take a break from their daily life. - Mmm-hmm. Anyways, the husband handcuffs the wife to a bed to play some erotic games, but all of sudden the husband has a heart attack so the wife is just left there handcuffed to the bed frame and no one's there to help her. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that sounds intense. - Oh, yeah. - What happens? Basically... Basically she starts to have all these hallucinations... She starts to have all these hallucinations... No, I'm not gonna reply. It's fine. I mean, no, please, it's fine. Okay, okay. Just real quick. I think I could stay up here forever. I don't wanna go to work tomorrow. Yeah, it spoils you up here. It's too nice. How long did you say your aunt's gone? Um, about another month. So... Another month. It's ours for the month if you want. Absolutely. - Oh, she's lucky, man. - Yeah. She gets to travel the world for work and then comes home to this? Yeah, but that's... She works super hard. You work super hard. You keep working hard, you can have it too. Hmm, one of these days, maybe. Did you have a good week at work? I was good. I don't wanna talk about work though. Let's just enjoy the pool and the view while we can, right? - All right. - All right. Stop it. You know I hate that. Having a heart attack over here. Oh, you know what? - Actually, there is something I can tell you about work. - What's that? Did I tell you about the new guy, Lucas? No. Super fun guy. Everybody loves him. Um, he has been, you know, like joking around with everybody in the office, making everybody laugh. Um, and then Alfred, that old curmudgeony guy - that like never... - The mean old dude? Yes. Who never once said hi to me. - Yeah. - Never smiles, nothing. Um... So, Lucas is like trying to, uh, you know, break your shell, whatever. Trying to talk to him. And he writes him this little note, like on this Post-it, on this, like, sticky note. And it's like a picture, like Uncle Sam. Like, "I want you" and it says, like, "I'm going to get you to like smile at me, bud, "I'm not going to give up on you," like, something like that. And of course, you know like Alfred wouldn't typically go for something like that. Lucas, I swear, got the guy to smile. - No way. - Someone walked by his office as Alfred's looking at it and he's smiling. Stinkin' Lucas just cheers everybody up and makes the whole office better. - You sound a little jealous. - I'm a little jealous. Alfred never says hi to me. At the same time, I mean, like, this guy he just brightens up the whole office. It's awesome. Makes it a lot easier to go to work tomorrow. - Sounds funny. - Yeah. - Well, I could meet him. - Yeah, you'd love him. Yeah? - Yeah. - Cool, one these days. - One of these days. - Hey. Stop! - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm. It's chilly when the sun goes down, huh? - Hey. - Hey - You know what I was thinking? - What were you thinking? Well, I was thinking, since I'm always either at your place or you're always over at my place That maybe we should move in together. Really? Yeah, well, what do you think? I mean, I have to tell my landlord, like, a month in advance, but that shouldn't be a problem, we could do that. Yeah. So like my place is closer to work for both of us, anyway. Yeah. - Or we could find something else? - No. I like your place. We can move into your place. - Yeah? - Look at us. Real adults. Kind of. - Yeah, let's do it. - Do it? - Yeah - Okay. Okay. I'm so excited. Yeah, I see, I completely understand. We don't typically waive that installation fee. The reason being we don't make any money on the installation. That's actually the fee that we're charged from a third party, so... Yeah, but you know what? Let me, uh... Let me go speak to my boss and and see if there's anything we could do to make this process a little bit easier for you. How does that sound? Okay, hang tight for it. Hey, Nate. - Hey, Bruce. - How's it going? Good. Just about to close a deal with a client. I got him on hold, 'cause he wants me to talk to the boss - about waving the installation fee. - Hmm. Oh, man. People always expect things for free, huh? Yeah. Just tell him we don't make anything of that. Yeah, yeah, I already did. I'm gonna offer him the payment plan that works 99% of the time. Smart. Come see me at my desk when you leave. Sure. Josh, you still there? - Hey. - Sit down. - How did it go? - All good. Closed the deal. Easy peasy. I knew the second I walked into their house, they would be interested. Good job. You've had a good month. Made lot of sales. I'm really proud of how far you've come. Thank you. I've been working hard and honestly I love the idea that contributing the environment, selling these solar panels. That's the right mindset, Nate. That's exactly why I want to talk to you about something, - and see what you think about it? - Yeah, sure. You know the office we opened in New York City a few months ago? Yeah. How's that going? Not so good, apparently. I was there last week and the place is a complete shit show. - That sucks. - The sales seem eager to learn, but Ron, the guy I hired to train them, is a complete mess. He's never in the office. I did some social media stalking on him and found out he's always going to these yacht parties and getting trashed. - Really? - Yeah. I talked to another guy in the office who said, on the rare occasion, that he does make it in he's usually hung over and sleeping at his desk. And while the sales team is out there trying to make sales and when they fuck up and they need guidance, the guy they're supposed to go to is crashed at his desk. - That's a bummer. - Yeah. That's where you come in. I want you to go over there and get that team going. I can't think of a better manager than yourself. New York? Me a manager? Wow, Bruce, that's an amazing opportunity. Well, you deserve it. And it's only for six months just to get the ball rolling. After that, you'll come back here, you'll still be a manager. But we'll give you 50% increase in your base salary. Plus, you'll get a percentage of the sales that your entire team makes. Oh, wow. That sounds awesome. I've always wanted to train a team of people. I don't know what to say. Um... Let me think about it, and, uh, I'll give you an answer in the morning. No, no, no, no. This is not one of those times when you think about it. You say, "Thank you" and "When do I leave?" I just wanted to talk to Jessica, you know, before I made any decisions. Listen to me, you're a smart guy, you don't wanna be knocking on doors for the rest of your life. And Jessica, she'll be happy that you're making a lot more money. Maybe you can buy her some nice gifts. And six months goes by in a flash. Any chance it'll last longer than six months? No chance. Big sales are still here, so I'll need you to come back here and head up this team. Yeah, I guess six months isn't that long. I've been wanting a change of air for a while now anyways. That's the spirit. And as for Jessica, let me tell you something. I've been traveling back and forth to the East Coast since I've been married and my wife and I... still together. Still going strong for 22 years. Twenty-two years. Wow. Oh, hey. You wanna see the apartment we're gonna put you up in? Come here. Yeah. Let's see. Okay, so this overlooks Central Park. - This is the view from the balcony. - Wow. Living room. Twenty-four/seven security. Check this out. Parking in the basement. Hey. - Oh, hey. - Thanks for waiting. - Yeah, no worries. Um... - Mmm-Hmm. Oh, yeah. So, uh, what have you been up to? Um, pretty busy with work, I guess. I have to read these contracts that my boss has draft and make sure they look okay. Uh, it's a little stressful. Just because the deadline's are pretty tight. Yeah, I'm sure you'll be just fine. I mean, you're very smart and very dedicated. Thanks. Yeah, it's just a lot of responsibility, um... They know what they're doing, but if something's wrong and I don't catch it it's my fault and we're pretty much screwed. Oh, yeah. I mean, I hear you. - It does not seem fun. - No. So, what's up with you? Oh... Honestly, I don't know, I was kind of surprised that you contacted me after two weeks of not talking, you now. Managed to resuscitate a ghost. What do you mean? Well, obviously you ghosted me after a month of dating. Honestly, I didn't feel great about it. - Ghosted? - Yeah. Like, when instead of just telling someone you don't want to see them anymore, you just cut them off completely. Okay. Well, I didn't ghost you. We just stopped talking. Yeah, what's the difference? I mean you never texted me again after we went out to that restaurant in Pasadena. Okay, well you never texted me either. I mean, ghosting is when you actually ignore someone's attempts to contact you. Yeah, whatever. Why didn't you contact me then? I just thought that... you know, maybe you weren't interested anymore. Oh. Why? I don't know. Maybe the way you were communicating with me. I just got tired of the chase. Always texting, calling you first. It seemed like someone else was on your mind. Oh. Why did you think? Oh, that night at the restaurant, mainly. I mean, you were in your phone all night, and whenever you got a text message, this smile just came across your face. So... I don't know. Oh. Well, there wasn't anyone else I was seeing. Oh, my God. No, no, no. It was just my friend Rachel. She was texting me. All those photos of her, like trying on old dresses before she went out. Some of them were ridiculous. That was it. Okay. So why didn't you contact me? I guess I just didn't think you wanted to see me. I though you seemed kind of distant. And I don't know, maybe you were looking for something fun. Which honestly isn't really what I'm looking for. Well, I mean, hey, I'm not looking for a no strings situation either, so... Okay. I guess I had the wrong impression. Yeah, I think we both did. So, uh, now that that's sorted out. Can we start over? I mean, I don't know, we could catch a movie or something. Okay, yeah. What kind of movie? - Uh, do you like thrillers? - Hmm. Or we could see a rom-com, it's fine. Oh, no, no, no. I was just trying to think of some thrillers that have come out recently. I love thrillers. I would be totally down for that. Cool. Hey, what about the one you were telling me about the last time we went out? Uh, which one? The um, the creepy movie with the woman that gets her hands handcuffed to the bed while her husband has a heart attack. - Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. No, that one's not in theaters, I streamed it on Netflix Oh. Well, I mean, we could just do something else then. I mean, if you want, you know, we could do that. Come on, I mean Netflix and Chill. Shut up. I just wanna go into a food coma. I'm so stuffed. Let's just go to bed dressed. Oh, it's so pretty outside. Couch. It is nice. It's really nice. Pretty clear night. Yeah, picked a good restaurant tonight. - Authentic Italian food. - Hmm. good. I'm glad your belly is happy and full. You know that is one of De Niro's favorite restaurants. What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was so rude. - I'm serious. I'm serious. I believe you, I believe... I just, I'm sorry. It was, I just, as soon as you said De Niro. I just pictured Lucas' face during his De Niro impression. It's ridiculous, anyway, I can't. - His De Niro impression? - Yeah, it's really good. Oh, Lucas. He's just a little too funny, isn't he - Are you jealous? - Jealous? - That face says it all right there. - Jealous... I'm just saying you talk about Lucas more than you talk about anybody else. Okay, I also talk about my 70-year-old landlord. A lot. Too much, probably. You think I have a thing for him, too? - No. - No. - Oh, speaking of my landlord, I gave him my 30 days. - Oh. He was like super bummed but, you know. Um, I completely forgot to tell you. Um, talked to my boss today. - You wanna come sit down? - Yeah. Is everything... - Yeah. - ...okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um... - Good I think, um... - Okay. You know my boss called me into his office. He told me what a great job I've been doing lately and... you know, I've been closing a lot of deals, - and he's really proud of me and... - Good. Um, he kind of, - well, he wants promote me. - Babe. - Oh, my God, that's awesome, that's... - Yeah. You had me so worried for a minute. I know, but, you know, we're opening the new branch in New York. - Yeah. - And so... The manager they had didn't really work out. He wants to send me up there. - To, uh... - To New York. - Yeah. To kind of train their sales team - Mmm-hmm. and get everything off the ground and running. - How long would you be there? - It'd be for six months and... you know, I've never been in a management position before and I'd have like six or eight people under me, Yeah. But, you know, it's really not that big a deal. I'll just tell him I'm not interested in it and... - No, no, no, no. Shush. - I'll find something else here. Shut your beautiful face. I'm so excited for you. I'm just really sad for me 'cause I'm not gonna have you here. It'd only be for six months. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's not that long. - Right? I mean that's nothing. - Right. That's like what? Half a year. - You sure it's okay? - Yes. Wow, that's weird. We've never spent that much time apart before. I know. We can talk everyday. - Skype or... - Yeah. - I'm gonna miss you. - I'll miss you too. I'm also really excited for you. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Mmm. It's actually kind of perfect timing because my aunt is now going to Japan. - I know, uh, but... - Really? Yeah, but this is gonna be... wide open, so I can move out, hang out here. So you get to stay here some more. Mmm-hmm. Don't look at me like that. - Okay. - It's such a rough life - you got here. - I know. But I'm gonna be all alone. Alone in your mansion. - Yes. - With the pool. - I think you're gonna be all right. - Just be like, - just be sad for me for a second, okay? - Okay. - And then I can be like super excited for you. - Okay. All right. Aw... Hey, man. - How's it going? Thank you. - Yeah, how's it going? Ah, it's going, it's going, you know. Same old, same old. Still the same job. Same apartment, same life. Good. Glad to hear you're doing well. - How's everything with you? - Good. I actually, uh... I actually just got a job offer to move up to New York. Be a manager for six months at our company's office up there. - New York. All right. That sounds exciting. - Yeah. - So, what did you say? - I said yes, man. It's a huge promotion. Plus, it's only six months so why not? That and my boss didn't really give me much of an option. Didn't let me think about it, so... Well, it sounds like a great opportunity. Yeah, I think so. What did Jessica say about it? Uh, she was a little upset at first. We had... We had just agreed to move in together. Right before I got this offer, so... But she understands that it's a big opportunity. So, I think she's happy about it. Moving in together, you know, that's a big step. Congrats. Yeah, I guess that won't be happening. - Not for six months at least. - No. Oh, wait Did you know that, uh, Erica recently moved to New York. Yeah, yeah. I follow her on Instagram. I don't plan on seeing her, I don't wanna start any issues with Jess. Yeah, hey. I get it, I get it. So are you gonna tell Jessica that Erica's there? It's not worth it. I don't want her to worry for no reason. Ah, well, I think you should tell her. I mean if she finds out that your ex is in the same city as you, she might not take it that well. Hmm, well... Its's not really what I'm worried about right now. Oh, yeah? What are you worried about then? There's this coworker that Jess keeps talking about. This Lucas guy. She keeps talking about how funny he is, and how everyone in the office loves him. Even the old guy who doesn't say hi to anybody, - says hi to Lucas. - Oh, come on. You don't think that she likes him like that. I mean if she's comfortable enough to bring him up in front of you that probably means that you have nothing to worry about, don't you think? Look, I'm, I'm almost positive that she wouldn't do anything like that with him, but we have never spent this much time apart. I don't wanna be thinking the whole time that I'm in New York, that she's spending all her free time with this other dude. Look, that's understandable, but she's a nice girl and I'm sure she'd never betray you. Besides, you need to be focused on other things right now. Like how you two are gonna stay in touch. Wish it were that easy, but it's not. Look, I need your help, man. My help? Sure you got it. Wait, I'm not following her man. No, no. I don't want you to follow her. Okay. So what do you need from me? It's a pretty big favor. You might think I'm crazy. Okay. Just say it. Come on, what is it? I want you to try and seduce her. What? What? No. No, no. You're joking. I'm dead serious. She's your girlfriend, man. You're about to move in with her. I don't wanna be remembered as the guy who tried to seduce her. - Imagine if you marry her then. Come on. - Yes, exactly. That's exactly it. What if I marry her? And then I find out later that she slept with her coworker or some other guy. Don't you think it's a little too late at that point? Yeah. This is very weird. No one requests this. Do you realize how absurd this sounds? We're not teenagers anymore, man. I would do whatever I can to help you, but... You're like a brother to me, but this is absolutely crazy. Come on, dude. Okay, imagine this scenario, I try to seduce her, she most likely will reject me, and from then on, I'm labeled as your creepy friend who has no sense of boundaries. I'll be the unwanted guest at all of your parties and events. Imagine me being the best man at your wedding after something like that. I can't imagine it. So why me, man? Why can't you find someone else to do this? Because out of all my friends, out of everybody I could possibly ask to do this, you're the only one she trusts. You're my best friend, man. She trusts me. Oh, for what? She trusts you enough to spend some time alone with you. Jesus, this is absolutely crazy. Okay, um... Say that I agreed to do this and I'm not agreeing. When? Just how would I even approach her? I mean, there's gotta be some places that you all go in common. Where do both you hang out? I don't know. Well... Jessica. Jess. Jess. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. I was really... Yeah, yeah, no, you're killing it on there. - Thank you. - How you been? Pretty good. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. My work's been good, I... How you been? I thought, I thought you usually go to the gym during the day, I've never... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I normally do but, uh, you know, new management at the restaurant, so, my schedule's a little crazy right now. Sure, yeah. So, uh, Nate's going to New York soon. - Yeah, he is. - How are you doing about that? Yeah, I'm really excited for him. So it's... it's great. Um, it's only six months, but it'll go by fast. plus we're gonna Skype every day and and keep in touch and everything. I might go visit him. - Awesome. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and while you're here, don't think about it too much - 'cause it'll be over before you know it. - Exactly. Plus then it gives me more time to work out every day. Work on my perfect body so he sees what he's missing. - Well, you look great. - Thank you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll let you get back to it. - Thanks. - Hit my stuff and I'll catch you in a little bit. - Okay, cool. Hey, Jess. Totally forgot o mention this earlier, but there's this bar that opened down the street Doing a promo for dollar drinks this weekend. - Dollar drinks? - Yeah. - That's unheard of in LA. - Yeah, I know. That's great. Yeah, we gotta go. Uh, I think Nate has like next Friday off. Well, you see, it's a promo. It's opening weekend and today's the last day. I'm going right after I shower up. - Um, you're welcome to come if you're free. - Um... - Yeah. No, I'm not doing anything. Yeah, let's, let's go. - Cool. - I just need to, I need to change and everything. - Yeah, yeah, no. Shower up. Give me like 20 minutes, is that cool? - Sounds good, sounds good. - Yeah, I'll see you in a minute. Will do. Hey, so this is it. Oh, I remember this. I remember this used to be the Blind Gypsy. Oh, that was like a billion years ago. The place has changed management like four times since then. Okay, well, it's a really hard business to keep going, - especially in L.A. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, man. - Hey, Nate. How'd it go? - How'd it go, what? - Come on, dude. Stop being funny. Jess texted me last night. She said she ran into you at the gym, y'all were going to the bar afterwards. - What happened? - What did she tell you about it? She texted me when I was at dinner with my boss and some investors. - I didn't reply 'cause I didn't wanna interrupt. - So you ignored it. Yeah, that was the whole plan. To see what she would do when she was alone with you. So, what happened? Okay, well, I went to the gym, 'cause you told me that she's normally there after nine and she was. So I told her about this new bar that was opening up down the street. So we went to the grand opening, had a couple drinks. Okay, so what happened after the bar? Well, first we got a little drunk because, you know, we had a couple shots. Go on. Oh, my God. - She was so rude. - I know. How do they expect to keep a business going if that's their service. Oh, dollar drinks maybe? Yeah, yeah. As long as it lasts. Hey, uh, let me walk you to your car. - Aw, thank you. - Yeah. This is my car. Yep. Hey, uh, listen. I hope you had fun tonight. I did. I wish Nate could've come though. - Yeah, well. Next time. - Yeah. - Oh. - Oh, I got it. Sorry, I'm... I'm drunk. Yeah, well, it's difficult to say no to dollar shots. Yeah. I just don't know if tequila was the best option for me. Yeah. But it was in a plastic bottle. It's where they keep all the classy stuff. You know that. Anyways, are you sure that you should drive? - I don't want you getting a DUI or anything happening. - Oh. No, no, I'm just, I'm just gonna sleep in the back, for like an hour until I feel like I can. - Got you, got you. - Yeah. It's not a bad idea, but, um, I'm actually like, five blocks this way. It you want a couch to crash on, you have one. It's up to you. You can go to work in the morning. - Play it safe tonight. - Are you sure? Yeah. Absolutely. Hey, you coming or not? Here we are. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks. - Let me go get you some blankets so you don't freeze. - Okay. Here you are. - Thank you. - Anytime. And this is for you. Oh. So... I have a question for you. - Mmm-hmm. - Hey, relax. Something I ask everybody. How do you really measure the strength of a relationship? - Oh. That's a really deep question. - Yeah. Uh... I don't know. I guess it would really depend on the bond between the people in it. Yeah but I mean, how can you test what a relationship would be able to really endure? I mean it'd have to go through something major. Right? Like something that's out of the ordinary, not, you know, some drastic event or something? Okay... can you give me any examples? Um... I don't know. Some big difference in priorities or some big... change. - Or something... - Yeah. No, okay. You have better ones but uh... What about distance? Yeah, I mean... Yeah, I guess it's a good example. Why are you asking me all of this? I'm just a curious person. I like to ask complicated questions. Sorry. No worries. I mean, you know obviously... Nate and I are going to be going through distance and that is going to be... a test on our relationship. So, yeah, I guess that's a good example of what you're talking about. Yeah. And you know, I think that you guys are gonna just do fine. I mean after all, I'll be here watching you and so will Erica with Nate. Erica? You mean his ex. She's in New York? You didn't know? No, I had no idea. What is she doing in New York? Well, she moved there to pursue her dream. Acting on Broadway. She's been there for a couple of months now, actually. - Really? - I follow her on Instagram. That's how I know about this. Did Nate mention anything about this to you? Yeah, well, I mean... He said that he's gonna avoid her. so that he doesn't create any unnecessary issues between you and him. All right. So then I guess the reason he tell me just because he forgot. Right? Because it's not a big deal to move to the same city as your ex. Why would that be relevant information to tell me? Yeah, no. You do have a point. It kind of is. I'm sure that he just didn't want you to worry while he was... Worry? Is there something I should worry about? I mean if... if he's so secure in his intentions... I mean why is he so... Why hasn't he mentioned it? I can't fucking believe he didn't mention it to me. - You think he will? - I don't know. I'm sorry. Hey listen, I'm a big believer in the theory that if a relationship is strong enough like, even if Nate and Erica hang out, there's nothing to worry about. Like us right now, for example. we can hang out. Nothing to worry about because if anything did happen, that would mean that you don't love Nate enough to be exclusive with him. And that you guys aren't even supposed to be together. I mean, obviously the same thing goes for Nate too... I mean if he really did anything with her and... I think you'll be fine but that would mean that... he doesn't love you enough to resist any temptation that might occur. Yeah I guess that's true. I mean if anything were to happen it would just mean that we weren't meant to be. Exactly. Take us, for example, no matter how close I get to you, you've got nothing to worry about because you really love him. Right. And... You don't even... if I touched you, there's nothing to worry about. 'cause you really care about him. Huh. And even... if I kissed you. I need to go. Why are you running away? What? You're afraid of what you might do. Why are you doing this? Because I want you two to be happy and if you can't even endure stuff like this, then why even be together at all? I'm not doing anything, I'm actually leaving. You can't control how you feel so you're avoiding it. You know what? You can believe whatever you want. I will. You know what? I don't run away from shit. Okay. I can stay here because I know my intentions... and you can go sleep in your room. Sure. Good night. Oh, my God. Dude, you scared the shit out of me. You're talking about how you kissed her and then she was kissing you back... Well... She... I didn't say that she kissed me back. I mean it was so quick that she didn't realize what happened. Whatever, man. It's just a kiss. Big fucking deal. When you started telling that story, I was picturing in my head that y'all were... Hooking up and you're... I don't want to even think about it. The important thing is that I was wrong about her. Well, there is something else. Sorry about... Look man, I'm so sorry. I had no idea that this is how it would've happened. I asked you to do it. Don't even think about it. Although it wasn't just her, I mean... Alcohol was involved too, obviously. What did she say after? - She just made me promise not to tell you. - Shit. She felt pretty guilty about it. She should feel really guilty about it. What are you going to do? I'm not going to do anything. I'm gonna wait until she confesses. What if she doesn't confess? She'll confess. And if she doesn't, I'll find one or another to make her. And if she confesses, what are you going to do at that point? I'm gonna break up with her and I'm never see her again. God, man. Why don't you just break up with her now? I wanted to feel all of this. I want her to feel all the guilt and all the shame for doing this to me. And breaking up with her now, would be way too easy on her I want to see how far she'll go. - Hey. - Oh, hey. So... What's up? What did you wanna talk about? Okay. Amber, I wanna make this easy as possible for both of us. So, I'm just gonna go to the point. Okay... So, uh... I think it's not gonna work out. And we should stop seeing each other. I can't tell if you're being serious right now - or if you're just joking around or... - Amber... Oh. Wow. That's unexpected. Sorry, I... I think it's for the best. Okay. Well, um... thanks for coming here and telling me in person, I guess. Especially, since we're not really in a relationship yet. Well... yeah. Honestly, I felt bad about the way I handled things before. - Hmm. - And I thought that I owed you this. I mean, coming here and telling you in person. No ghosting this time. Umm... thanks for that, I guess. Amber, you're a great girl. You're gonna find someone else just as great. It's just that I'm not that person. Sure. Still, I... I don't know, I guess I thought it was going pretty well between us. I mean, even if you're just getting to know each other. Yeah, I mean, things weren't going bad. So, why don't you wanna see me anymore? Uh... is there someone else? No, I... I just need some time to be by myself and... I can't be in a relationship right now. Fine. Sure. Um... okay. Goodbye, John. Bye. Bye. No, I'm sorry. That is bullshit. Three weeks ago, we met up, and you told me you were looking for a relationship. And now, you're saying you don't want anything serious? Come on. At least have the dignity to admit that you just don't like me. That's not true. I liked you enough to hang out with you several times. Okay, then, what happened? I mean, I get it, I understand, you just don't wanna be with me but what, you just woke up this morning and thought, "What am I doing with her?" Okay, uh... - 100% honest? - Yes. Please! There's someone else. Oh. And do you love her? No. No, I'm not in love. But you really like her? I think so. Uh... I don't know. But she loves you? I don't think she does. But she at least likes you, right? I honestly don't know. - It's very complicated. - Jesus. But she at least knows that you like her, right? I don't think. So, what are you waiting for? Why don't you tell her that? So... How are you feeling? Uh, I don't know, John. What do you think? I mean... how do you feel? Like everything's fucked up. Yeah. Well, not alone there. Yeah. Sure. I have some errands I have to run. I can't really stay long. Oh, yeah. No, right. Totally. Um... I really don't know how to tell you this. Why don't you just try? Okay. Um... Nate knows - everything about us. - What? John, you promised that you wouldn't say anything. It was just a one time's... He asked me to do this to you, Jess. He asked me to seduce you. What? That doesn't make any sense. What would he do that? 'Cause he doesn't trust you, okay? He's moving out of state and he's afraid that you're gonna go hookup with that funny co-worker of yours that you always rave about in front of him. Lucas? Are you kidding right now? Because this isn't fucking funny. No, I'm serious. He designed this sort of "Trust-test" for you and I wish I was joking, trust me. God! This is completely crazy. And you agreed to do this. You played me into cheating on him with you, so that you could prove a point? Why can't he just confront me? Because that's not the type of guy Nate is. Look, Jess, unfortunately, Nate's not the same guy I knew in middle school. And he's not the same guy that you fell in love, either. Well, you agreed to do it. So you're not that great either. Yeah. I know. For that, I apologize. Okay? You know, you're not an angel either. I mean... I didn't exactly make you sleep with me, did I? No, but I felt like shit about it since. I mean, I slept with his best friend. And now you're telling me, that you planned this! This is sick! That is fucking sick! You know what? I'm leaving. - Don't. - Why? Because... Geez, this is so fucked up and in one way, this is everybody's fault. But... now we know, you two weren't meant to be together. Okay but why are you telling me all this, John? Does pointing out how shitty my relationship relieve you of some of the guilt or something? I am not trying to justify what I did. Okay then why am I here, John? 'Cause maybe I haven't been able to stop thinking about you since then. Oh, my God. So, you called me today, to tell me that you have feelings for me? What do you expect me to say? "Based upon how shitty my relationship is, oh hey, since Nate's out of town," "Why don't we get together instead?" Yeah, well, not exactly. Leave me alone. Jess, wait. One minute, please. What? What! What do you want? What are you gonna do with Nate? I don't know but since apparently he already knows, I'm sure it'll come up. What if it doesn't? I mean it's got to, right? If he cares... at all. Uh... Babe... I forgot to tell you about the craziest thing that happened at work. - Lucas, you remember? - Yeah. - He got fired. - Really? Because, first of all, he lied on his resume. But he was planning on robbing the bank that his girlfriend worked at. They, like, found all this plans and everything and when they looked into it, they found out that he had this whole criminal record that like, somehow, they overlooked during the interview process. - Isn't that crazy? - No kidding. That is insane. It's like... anyway, now they're like investigating the whole thing. It's a big nightmare but... - He's a more interesting dude than I thought. - Yeah. Right? It is like a whole double life. Oh, there is something else I want to tell you. Um, so I was at the gym, the other day and I ran into John. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, we were both there working out, Um... did he tell you that he saw me? Anyway, he was telling me about this backyard... across the street... Is that your phone? Hold on a sec. Hello? No, it's ok. Yeah, what's up? By tomorrow? Yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah. All right. All right, bye. Sorry about that. What were you saying? Uh... I don't know... All right. It's not that important if you can't remember. Don't forget I'm leaving at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday. All right. I'll be over Monday night then. Okay. Cool. Jessica. He didn't mention it to me. Why? - He didn't? - No. Actually, he acted completely normal. You did tell him, right? You didn't lie about that? No, I didn't lie to you. I told him everything about us. Well then, why didn't he say anything? Does he even care? I think that he's waiting for you to confess. What makes him so sure that I would confess? Does he know that I know about the plan? I can't tell him about that. Then what is he waiting for? What if I don't say anything? Then, what, he's just going to go to New York and... break up with me over the phone? Or pretend like nothing ever happened? I think he's pretty sure that you're gonna come clean about this soon. He doesn't view you as the type of person that can hold a secret and I don't know. He didn't really explain it to me. I don't know. What I do know is that, when you do confess, that's when he plans on breaking up with you. So, he's just trying to punish me by drawing it out and... and ending it anyway. God, what kind of person does this? - This is so fucked up. - Hey. He's gonna leave soon. Whatever you two tell each other, it's going down. It's for the best that it does. You think? Look, I mean, do you really wanna be with someone like that after knowing all this? I mean, what we did was wrong. But at the end of the day, it would've never happened if Nate didn't set it up. But part of the reason that it happened was because of how close we were. For what it's worth, I didn't think you we're gonna do anything with that coworker. - I wasn't - I know, you're smart. You're caring. You're absolutely beautiful. He doesn't deserve someone like you, so just, please, give me a chance. I'm not gonna hurt you like he did. Bruce, it's Nate. Hey, what's going on? Oh, really? I think that's the last of it. All ready to go. What? I know... Six months is a long time. Yeah, it's far. New York is like the other side of the world basically Hardly. Like half-way maybe? Quarter of a way? Yeah, maybe a quarter. - We'll be all right though. - I know and... - I'm excited for you. - Yeah. Got nothing to worry about. We trust each other. Yeah. - It's a big opportunity. - Yeah. I'm proud of you. I am. - Just gonna miss you. - I'll miss you too. - Love you. - Love you. - Don't cry every day. - I'll try not to. - You're gonna be a big boy. - Yeah, yeah. Can we just stay here for a minute? For a minute. You know what's great about us? You mean beside the fact that we're both just devastatingly attractive? Well, yeah. Besides that. Well, what is so great about us? - We, unlike all these other chumps around here, - Mmm-hmm. still believe in commitment. Relationships are changing. People don't believe in that anymore. Yeah. That's what makes us so strong. Makes us so good together, you know. We can always trust each other, no matter what. Even with all these crazy dating apps and... social media. Always on us, world where it's so easy to cheat now. I know that I can trust you, no matter what. Because we tell each other everything. It's what a good relationship is built on. Built on that trust, and that loyalty and honesty. And no matter what, I don't have to worry about anything. It's the same for you. Right? Everything okay? What's wrong? Um... I haven't been completely honest with you or completely loyal. What are you talking about? Uh... So, a couple of weeks ago, I was working out, I ran into John. - Yeah, you told me that. - Um... Well, I didn't mention that we... uh, that bar across the street had just opened up, - it was 1600 or something. - Yeah. They were having this promotion that week because it was new... uh, doesn't matter, anyway... So, we went over to check it out and... we got really drunk and... And? And... And we kissed, um... Did you... sleep with him? Babe... It was just... I'm sorry. It was... It was stupid. I'm so sorry. I don't know... It was just... I was drunk. We were so drunk. I felt guilty for weeks. Weeks about going on this trip. - I was afraid of hurting you... - I know... - hurting us... - I know. Please. Please. Can we just talk about it, please? - Sorry. - I almost didn't take this job. I'm sorry. I need you to go. - Babe, please. - Go! I said, go! Get out! I don't wanna see you again. Yeah, man. She just left. Yeah, come on up. - John. - Hey, what's up? Can I get you anything? Soda or anything? Uh... yeah, water's great. So, how did it go? Everything went perfect. Exactly how we planned it. - She admitted everything. - Mm-hmm. - Came right out and said it. - Nice. I'm scot-free. I'm officially single again. Finally. Finally. That's good to hear. Single, ready to take on New York, look at you. No. Uh... I thought I told you. Did I not? Last week, my boss called. It fell through and I'm not going to New York. My bags are empty, there's nothing in 'em. Oh, shit. - You all right, man? - Yeah. Yeah... - I mean it's for the best, really. - Cool, cool. Now that I'm free and... - So... - Back in the game. You're gonna tell Jess that you're still living in L.A., right? I don't know why I would. I don't owe her anything. - Okay... - She cheated on me. Yeah. Look dude, I know you're still feeling weird about it. But, don't. All right? I asked you to do this and you stuck your neck out there and you did it for me. You have nothing to feel guilty about, man. - I know... - I'm glad you did it. - I know. - It was going down, man. If it was not for you, she would've slept with somebody else. And I never would've known. You know what I'm saying, it could've been a lot worse. - Yeah. - I could've... proposed or something crazy. - And found out later. - Yeah, Nate, uh... you know, I've actually, you know, I've seen Jess a couple of times. She hit you up again? - Yeah. - She is freaking ruthless, man. - I mean... - Who are you texting? "Hey, can't wait to see you again - Jess." She's seriously hitting you up right now. She didn't leave here two minutes ago, man. - I told you she's crazy. - She was upset. You saved my life, man. Of course. You're not gonna see her, are you? Nate, I've been seeing her, I've been texting her. This has been going on ever since that night. It's not gonna happen again, right, John? - Jesus. - John. What are you thinking, man? Once a cheater is always a cheater. If she's willing to do it to me, she's willing to do it to you. I don't wanna... Oh, my God. I don't know what to say. You know what? Fine. But when she does the same shit to you, don't come crying to me because I won't be around. If you do this, we're done, man. Wow. Well, like I said. I'm sorry. John. John!
