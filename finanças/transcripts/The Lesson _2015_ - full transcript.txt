"The beliefs that your ideals can be achieved often, even when this does not seem likely to others." Wonderful. Your ideals being... your aspirations towards something innocent, something pure. Your idealism being the belief that it can be achieved, even if it does not seem likely to others. Exactly how I must have appeared to my older colleagues when I first started teaching 20 years ago. What a wonderfully empathic description of the word. Hmm? "Empathic," adjective, descriptive word of empathy. Abstract noun. Look up "empathy", Tindall. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... Good! Read it out. "The power of understanding and ima..." Imaginatively. "...imaginatively entering into another person's feelings." GALE: In other words, putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Ta-da! [Humming ballet music] So, a classroom of empathic, adjective, descriptive word, children, would have some ability to put themselves in their teacher's shoes. To imagine how it must feel for him or her to face a bunch of sneering, hostile, and apparently soulless adolescents, day after day for 20 years. To attempt to spark some flicker of... ...inspiration... through some of the greatest writers ever known... and to witness the relentless tide of the worst in human behaviors, ranging from indifference to animalistic aggression... to physical abuse. [Shoe hits the ground] [Shuddering] I was an idealist once. I believed inspiration was the key to learning. I had empathy for my students. For the shortcomings of their upbringings. For the miserable blankness of their emotionally, intellectually, and materially deprived circumstances. 20 years ago... You see, I thought... [Chuckles] I thought if they'd encounter humanity, they'd respond with humanity. Do you know what Charles Lamb said? He said, "Let us live the beauty of our own reality." Do you know what he said to Wordsworth? He said, "Have I not enough without your mountains?" He was talking about the beauty he found in the ordinary. In the streets of London. In the urban deprivation that surrounded him. The same urban deprivation that inspired William Blake to write "Songs of Innocence and Experience." I thought if I could just... tap into this imagination... these children could enter their surroundings imaginatively. They'd see the beauty and the horror... of the mundane, of the ordinary, within the very four corners of their own existence. The same imagination would lead them beyond it. Into the world.

Now, do you understand the point of this class? ♪♪ Do you understand the point of this class? Good. Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The forefather of modern child-centered education and the Romantics, or should I say, subjective individualism. [Slowly] Subjective individualism. A departure from the Enlightenment. [Slowly] The Age of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a movement away from religion and superstition, hailed as the triumph of reason. Marked by increasing empiricism. And the belief that everything in the universe was knowable through empirical observation. Observation through our five physical senses. Hearing, sight, taste, touch, smell... combined with mental reasoning skills. In other words, scientific experiment. It was meant to be, as I say, a liberation from the religious dogma and superstition of the Middle Ages. But it became, in turn, restrictive and reductive. Reductive. - R-E-D-U-C-T-I-V-E. - [Breathing heavily] Ten seconds, Tindall. Now, you've practiced... Even with the inability of your right hand. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... One. [Gasping] Ten... Ten... "Tending to present a subject or problem in a sim... simplified form." Yes. It was a movement that had no space in it for perception, for the vast complexities of the human mind. It dealt only in universal truths, empirically observed. All the same to all men. "Your definition of a horse?" Thomas Gradgrind asked Bitzer. "40 teeth, namely 24 grinders, 4 eye-teeth, 12 incisive." "Sheds its coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds its hoofs, too." "Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with iron." "Age known by marks in mouth." [Drops hammer] Is that it? Is that all the horse is? I might as well say you and Whitely here are bipeds with opposable thumbs, made of blood, bone, and gristle with... slightly more complex set of synapses than the average animal. Nothing else. Perhaps you are. Perhaps you fucking are. So, Rousseau's interest was in human perception. Imagination became God. He believed man was innocent and naturally good. He said, "Man is born free, but everywhere he's in chains." He wrote the first treatise on child-centered education. [Laughs] Yet, curiously enough, delivered all his children into orphanages. [Laughs] That, dear Tindall, is irony. [Laughs] But we'll come back to that. [Continues laughing] "Man is born free, but everywhere he's in chains." But what imprisons us? Self-interest, greed, society? What is society? We fall from grace... But how? Why? The biblical metaphor, Adam and Eve, made into an epic celebration of man's fall in Milton's "Paradise Lost", explains it as an inevitable flaw in God's plan for us to have free will... in there. Inside... evil... waiting. Do you know what Blake said about Milton? Hmm? He said, "The reason Milton wrote in fetters... when he wrote of God and heaven, and at liberty when he wrote about hell and devils, was because he was a true poet, and of the Devil's party, without knowing it." [Sniffs] Fetters. Cuffs. Bound. The imagination bound... bound by a religion, that demands the repression of creative thought and passion. In "Jane Eyre," Charlotte Brontë sublimates... [Hits table] Sublimate. S-U-B-L-I-M-A-T-E. Sublimate! Ten seconds, Tindall! Ten, nine, eight, seven, GALE: six, five, four, three... Divert... [Stammering] "Divert the energy "of an unacceptable feeling or impulse, "especially a sexual one, "into activities that are considered to be socially more acceptable." Exactly! That Brontë sublimates... Jane Eyre's adult rage and passion into the mad and dangerous psychological double Bertha Mason, the mad woman in the attic. Milton's description of the devil becomes more and more glamorous, more and more exciting, you see? You see, the devil steals the show, completely at odds with Milton's original intention, whereas Bertha Mason is deprived a human voice. [Stammers] Animalistic grunts and groans, perhaps, revealing Brontë's own discomfort with her own sexual passion and rage. As she's unable to fully... fully escape the expectations of her cultural surroundings. You see? So... so uncontrollable feelings... are so often repressed by society because they're dangerous! Because they threaten to uproot the deep foundations of a society built to contain us as passive docile beings. That, dear Tindall, is real, real evil! The desire of some human beings to suppress the rest! ♪♪ But where's it come from? Is it evil? Huh? Take away God, take away the devil, from our creation. And what is left? What makes us good? What makes us bad? For Rousseau, it was when the first man duped others into believing that he owned a piece of land. Land ownership. Is that ridiculous? Who's to say I own this or you own that? Nonsensical laws woven over centuries to seduce us into believing we own something over another man. Feudalism. [Snaps fingers] Feudalism. Look it up, Tindall. No, wait. I'll just spare you the effort. [Flipping pages] Feudalism. "The dominant social system in Medieval Europe, in which the nobility..." Thank you. ...held land from the crown in exchange for military service." Every bit of the country divided up... and given to those who helped the King rise to the top. Thank you. By William Blake's time, when he wrote "London"... every bit of the charted streets was carved up... and owned by somebody. [Laughing] Even the fucking river! The charter'd Thames was owned by somebody. ♪♪ [Breathing heavily] "I wander through each charter'd street, near where the charter'd Thames does flow." "And mark in every face I meet marks of weakness, marks of woe." "In every cry of every man, in every infants cry of fear, in every voice: in every ban, the mind-forged manacles I hear." William Blake. "Songs of Innocence and Experience." Mmm. Manacles. Shackles. Handcuffs. Mind-forged, made in there. But for the Romantics and Dickens... like Rousseau, we are born innocent. Naturally good. It is society... and the complex chains of governance, born out of greed, that lead to oppression and injustice that corrupt us. [Jingling] But what is society, except just many individuals? We can't all be born innocent, pure, and good. Where does greed and the desire to harm others come from? [Whistles] Thomas Hobbes, "Leviathan." Written during the English Civil War between 1642 and 1651. Before Milton wrote "Paradise Lost". Like Milton, he believes in the natural state of evil, in the Biblical instruction of inherent original sin. But he goes further weaving original sin into a comprehensive social strategy. He states, "The life of man in its state of nature is..." "Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." ♪♪ He states that people need an absolute ruler to control them. Without one, there can be no peace. ♪♪ And hereby is it manifest that during that time, that man shall live without a common power to keep them all in awe, he shall live in that condition known as "war."

Do you see, Tindall? [Gasping] The interesting about "Animal Farm" is at the end of the novel, the animals can't tell the difference between the original human oppressors, the aristocracy, and their new pig oppressors, Stalin, whereas the film, allegedly funded by the CIA, ends with the animals simply overthrowing the evil commie pigs. A fact not often stated. But I digress. To digress, verb. Something you're doing. For example... A hammer, noun. To hammer, verb. A nail gun, noun. What is the verb? Is it "to nail gun"? Possibly. - Once again, I digress. - [Gasping] To veer away from the subject at hand. [Laughing] At hand! [Continues laughing] Anyway, back to "Lord of the Flies". We now know it's an allegorical novel. Allegorical, adjective, descriptive word of allegory. You know what an allegory is, right, Tindall? "Lord of the Flies" is an allegory of human society. It asks the question free from religious indoctrination, what are we human beings? Are we born naturally good, are we born blank, like a new page, are we born with the natural predisposition towards chaos, greed, and conflict? Is evil something learned, or is it something achieved, or is it a result of hardship, injustice, suffering? It takes a group of children... Yes, children, Tindall. Yes.

[Car alarm blaring] Fuck. Mia, come back. Mia, I'm sorry, all right? [Car alarm continues] [Sighs] MIA: Hey. Mia, hi. Have you seen Fin? Uh, no, I was at my Dad's. What's up? When did you see him last? Uh, a few hours ago. He was with Joel. Have you got Joel's number? Yeah. Why? What's going on? Nothing. He just... They didn't come home. Just wanna check he's okay. What are you, his fucking mother? Just call him, will you? [Sighs] [Sighs] It went to voicemail on it. Fin's did as well. Shit, where would they go? Fuck knows! Wish they'd told me. This place is as dead as the fucking underworld, isn't it? Something feels wrong. Something feels bad. Right. Well, I'm going home. You're welcome to join me. You don't give a shit, do you? The question is, why do you? [Scoffs] You know where I am if you need me. [Chuckles] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Dogs barking] [Breathing heavily] [Groans] [Choking] [Gasps] [Breathing heavily] [Gasping] [Keys jingling] [Whimpering] Stop! Mia! - [Whimpering] - [Groaning] Fin, what the fuck is going on? [Breathing heavily] I know you, don't I? From last year, or two years ago. You came for the last few years of school from somewhere, didn't you? Look at you now. You've come a long way since you let your education slip off your skin. As easily as you allowed your makeup to slip onto other boys' shirts, I'm sure. Let's see, if you can learn something now, hmm? Now, where was I? Jack! Jack represents human beings without the enforceable laws of civilization. Lawlessness, savagery, and a thirst to control others. Jack represents Leviathan. Hobbes' natural state of man. But Roger... Now, remember this... Roger's often overlooked. Roger is the group's natural sadist. He is the one free from the controls of normal society, best able to fulfill his potential as bully, torturer, killer. I'd say you were a Roger, Whitely, if the tables were turned. And here we come to the most important abstract noun in literature, perhaps, in life. Irony. [Coughing] - [Groaning] - Read it! Read it. I found the place in the dictionary for you. - Now, fucking read it, Whitely! - [Yelling] Ten, nine, eight, seven... [Groans] [Grunting] [Yelling] - Irony. - [Firing nail gun] "An expression or situation marked by deliberate contrast between apparent and intended meaning." Meat... meat with thumbs! - [Gurgling] - [Sobbing] Oh, God. No! [Sobbing] No! [Both sobbing] If you scream, I'll kill you. Is that clear? [Grunts] [Whimpering] [Gasping] The fact that I appear to be torturing you, and yet, I accuse Whitely of being a sadist... could be construed as irony. [Breathing heavily] And let me tell you something. I'm not a natural sadist. [Whimpering] I could spot the sadists. The special look they had. The void. Blank. Empty. I've got over 50,000 pounds worth of first editions at home. I'd give them all... all of them... just to see one child with an open mind and open heart be inspired. The irony in "Lord of the Flies" stems from the fact... that the boys escape the terrible and yet seemingly righteous war that the adults are waging... and find themselves in a beautiful place. But their basic natures end up taking over, and they end up at war. Do you know what William Golding's profession was, Tindall? Can you guess? [Gasping] He was a school teacher. [Sniffs] Right. It's time for a test. I'm afraid this is mostly for you, Tindall, as Whitely here is incapacitated, and, um... Mmm. I know it's a foreign name. Vukovic! Vukovic here has missed a chunk of the class through no fault of her own. Are you ready? Good! - What's a noun? - Ob... ob... object. Excellent. What's an abstract noun? Ten, nine, eight, seven... Have a feel... thinking something. Not quite. Five, four... Feelings, ideas, concepts. Roughly, yes, roughly. Next, define an ideal. Third nail, Tindall. Now, remember... Ten, nine, eight... Something... something perfect. No, not really. Something seems perfect, something to look up to. Will do. What's idealism? Uh, believing you can get the perfect thing, even when others don't think you can. Empathy? Putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Allegory? A story... a story with a hidden meaning. Totalitarianism? Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... I don't fucking know! I don't know! [Sobbing] [Sobbing] [Screaming] [Sobbing] "O, Rose, thou art sick." "The invisible worm, that flies in the night "through the howling storm "has found out thy bed of crimson joy. And his dark secret love does thy life destroy." Totalitarianism. Ten seconds, Tindall, before I put this nail in her head. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... One person having total control, running everyone. Dictator! Archetype? Symbolic of a type, a kind of person or thing. What did Thomas Hobbes say about the life of a man? "Nasty, brutish, and short." Who wrote the first treatise in child-centered education? Jean-Jacques Rousseau. "In every cry of every man, in every infant's cry of fear, in every voice: in every ban..." "The mind-forg'd manacles I hear." William Blake, London, "Songs of Innocence and Experience," circa 1794. The chart'd streets and the chart'd Thames refer to what, what does it mean? FIN: Everything that was divided up by the rich. - Who wrote "Hard Times"? - Dickens! - "Leviathan"? - Hobbes! Thomas Hobbes! Who wrote to Wordsworth, "Have I not enough without your mountains?" Charles Lamb. - Who wrote "Paradise Lost"? - Milton. What did William Blake say about Milton? That... that he was a poet of the devil's side but didn't know it! [Laughing] Tindall, you're... you're a fucking genius! [Continues laughing] [Whimpering] Milton sublimated his own rage and passion without realizing it in his the depiction of the devil. Who did Charlotte Brontë sublimate Jane Eyre's - ...passion into? - Wordsworth. [Screams] You obviously did not understand the question. Jane Eyre learns to repress her feelings at an early age. But Charlotte Bronte finds an outlet for the expression of female rage and passion where? FIN: I don't know! Please, stop! GALE: You know it! You know it! Ten, nine, eight... MIA: Please! FIN: I can't think! GALE: ...seven, six, five, four... Bertha! GALE: What did she say? - Bertha. - What did you say? - Bertha-fucking-Mason! - [Groans] [Gale gurgling] [Yelling] [Striking Mia] [Screaming] She said... She said, "Bertha"... She said, "Bertha Mason"! Mia? Mia? Fuck! Mia? She must have learned it in class! She must have picked it up! She used to look at me like I was a piece of shit on her trainers, but she listened! She must have listened! GALE: What are you gonna do, Tindall? The fuck! Shut the fuck up! You're bright, you see? - I always knew it! - Shut the fuck up! [Grunts] - Let me get the keys. - No, no fucking way! Then, we're stuck here. Someone... someone will come. She's bleeding badly. Let me get the keys. Why the fuck would you get me the keys? I give you my word. Look what you've done here today, how accurate your recall was. [Groans] No one's ever seen it before, have they? Your intelligence. Why didn't you show it before, Finley? Just once. Just a spark of what you've shown here today in the classroom. All this could have been avoided. [Breathing heavily] You're not a killer, Finley. Just one thing. I'm left-handed. [Screaming] ["White Dust" by Greenhorse plays] Meat! Meat with opposable thumbs, remember? You taught me that! Now! Now, you're just meat! Fucking cunting bastard! Get me the keys, unlock me, and I'll give you your thumbs back. Get to a hospital in time, and they might just be able to stitch them back on. It's a miracle what they can do nowadays. [Groans] The nerves die the longer you leave it! Mia! [Screaming] Wake the fuck up, Mia! [Grunts] Only the educated are free. [Grunting] [Cracking noise] [Hammering Mr. Gale] ["White Dust" by Greenhorse continues] [Drops hammer] ["Rise" by Ruth Stavric and Julsy plays] Mia, where's the blanket? I'm cold. What the fuck? Get out. What? Get the fuck out! Fuck. [Indistinct TV chatter] WOMAN: Have you got an anniversary coming up Chris? CHRIS: I certainly have, thank you very much. There's only 20 of these pieces left and, uh... I think you should snap them up. I mean, look how the necklace is, uh... It really compliments the earrings. [Indistinct TV chatter] CHRIS: ...something wrong, you wanna make it up to her. WOMAN: I hope you're not talking about yourself, Chris. CHRIS: Oh, certainly not. Certainly not. I'll be picking up one of these for my wife anyway. WOMAN: You're not the kind of man that forgets an anniversary, are you? CHRIS: Certainly not, but if you are... get your credit cards out and get on the phone now to pick up one of these one-time-special-only pieces. WOMAN: Here's the number on the screen, guys. ["Astra" by Motohiko Hirami and Julsy plays] [Snickers] FIN: I thought you were gonna sell that one. I want to keep it. Do you want anything? Yes. ["Happiness" by Greenhorse plays] So... What's it all about, huh? [Laughs] ["Happiness" by Greenhorse continues] Synchro: Peterlin
