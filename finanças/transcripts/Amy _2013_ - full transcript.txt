( Breathing heavy, running ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Sobbing ) ( High-pitched tone ) Do you abide in god, and in all the commandments from his holy scripture? Yes, I do. ( Soft music playing ) ( Laughing ) You can't get me! ( Church bell rings ) Can you renounce the devil, the world... And your own flesh and blood? Yes, I can. ( Choir music playing ) Amy... Amy, uh, would you-- would you join me at church this Sunday? ( Soft music playing ) Do you believe in Jesus Christ as the son of god? Yes, I do. ( Choir music continues ) In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit... You are baptized. ( Choir music fades up ) I make an oath to never do anything against god's will. I also promise to stay with my community for the rest of my life... And to make myself an example for the generations to come. Congregation (o.S.): Amen. ( Soft music playing ) ( Music stops ) ( Eerie music playing ) Hello? There someone out there? ( Sighs ) Okay. ( Laughing ) Very funny. You wanted to see if I'd be afraid? You were. Mm-hm. Go on, laugh. Amy... You look so beautiful when you smile like that. I just forget everything when you smile like that. The color purple looks lovely with your skin. And your eyes are brighter when you're in a better mood. ( Soft music continues ) What just happened? I don't know, I feel like somebody's here. No, there's no one here... Except us. Well, i-- I felt like I saw something, or someone, didn't you? Listen, Amy, this is a very vast wilderness we're sitting in here... And there's a very remote possibility for something to bolt out of the blue... And us not be aware of it. I don't think you understand, Robert. There's something very wrong here. ( Faint rustling ) Look, Robert! There, look at that! There's a shadow, look. Amy, I don't understand what happened to you. I mean, if you didn't want me to put my hand on you... You could have just told me. Instead you pretend like there's shadows and things in the bushes. Why do you tell me these things? Do you think I would come all this way to meet you... If I didn't like it? Why would I tell lies? I don't know. I didn't... really. I do want to be with you, Robert... very much. I'm sorry, Amy. I really love you. ( Soft music playing ) ( Music stops ) ( Faint, distant whispers ) What is going on? Mid-afternoon appearing like night. This is odd. I told you there was something wrong in this area, I know it. I feel it, let's-- let's move from here. Don't worry, Amy, you're safe with me. Don't let go of my hand, okay? Follow me. Okay? Okay. ( Eerie music playing ) ( Inspirational music playing ) I heard Mr. Yager made a new buggy for his new horse... For the craft festival. Oma, are these the ones? Yes, yes, that's them. Soak them until you hang all the wet ones. ( Soft music playing ) You must have a long life, Robert. Well, how do you know that? Because out in the east that's what they say... When someone comes and you've just been thinking about them. How are you, Robert? I'm fine, Mrs. Miller, very well, thank you, how are you? Good, by the grace of god. And you, grandmother, how are you? I'm quite well, thank you for asking. How is everything in your family, Robert? All good, by his wonderful grace. The reason I came here today is to tell you that-- on my way back home last evening, I met your son, Daniel. He, uh-- well, he's completely changed. I wasn't even able to identify him until he waved his hand at me. Robert (o.S.): I had stopped off for a drink on my way back home. That's where I saw him. He seemed happy, he was surrounded by many friends. ( Eerie music playing ) Robert (o.S.): The Daniel that you or I know... Isn't it a beautiful day? Yes, it is. I wonder if we'll see Amy today. I think we might. I hope so, I wonder if she's working on the quilt. I think there was one. I hope so. Amy, how are you? Um, good. Are you still working on that beautiful quilt? Um, yes, we are. Is she helping with it? Um, she is, yes, she is. We used that bed design that you guys gave us. Oh, nice. So we almost finished the quilt. Guests for the wedding can add something. That's wonderful. But we'll see you on Sunday, yes? Yes, see you at the wedding. Enjoy your day. Wasn't it wonderful to see Amy? Yes. ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Ominous music playing ) ( Soft music playing ) * leaves to fall Amy. Rebecca... Rebecca's possessed. Rebecca's possessed! I-- I know it, i-- I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me, I'm not lying. Rebecca's possessed. Amy, we're all god's children. That could never happen. But I know what I saw. Even if what you say is true, you have nothing to fear. Our community will never conceal the possessed, Amy, never. You must understand this. She's correct, heed your mother's words. I do not expect you to talk about anybody in vain. We will not speak about this again. Trust me, my child, god is with us. Everything will be all right in time. ( Ominous music playing ) Robert. Would you believe me if I told you something? That depends. I'm serious. What is it that you want to say? Answer me, would you believe me if I told you something-- something unbelievable? I would. Now tell me. Do you believe that souls exist? I believe god exists. And souls, you believe they exist? Yes, I do. Evil souls exist as well, Robert. Isn't that right? Amy, that is what you wanted to say? That evil souls exist? Robert... Rebecca is possessed. What? You're serious. Oh, come on, don't be childish, Amy. I'm not joking, Robert. Rebecca is possessed, I saw an evil soul in her. Listen, Amy... There is no such thing as you're talking about, okay? She is not possessed. So you have to stop talking like that. I have to go. ( Ominous music playing ) Oma, how did you feel after visiting Rebecca? I'm not aware of her problem. Even the doctors don't know what's wrong with her. But I did notice one thing. You are right. She definitely isn't normal. Thank you, for confirming it. Your great-grandfather, Michael... Has been a bishop for nearly 45 years in our community. If anyone knows something about this, he will. But I don't understand why I'm the only one that can see evil souls... And no one else can. We will go see him to see what he will say. ( Soft music playing ) I see only one possibility. Do you remember, Claire, Amy was born on a cloudy day? Full of lightning and thunder. ( Thunder rolling ) With sight, it's a spark of light we all witnessed. I don't understand, how does that explain what's happening to me now? My dear child, the sight of such a powerful spark... Has the power to make any newborn baby blind. It is harmful even to the older ones. But somehow you were normal in every way. Smiling and full of life. You've been given a rare gift. This incident enlightened your inner eyes... Allowing you to see unusual things... That no ordinary person can witness. No wonder, he's right. ( Dramatic music playing ) I don't see why I have to keep quiet about Rebecca. I don't have a choice, I'm forced to. Are you even listening to what I'm saying, Robert? I can't just let her go like this, I have to do something about it. You don't have to do anything. There's no such thing as you're talking about. Do you believe that souls exist? We already discussed that. I told you that I believe god exists. And I told you that evil souls exist, as well... And I've seen it. I've seen it in Rebecca. Okay, let us assume that what you say is true. Then why can't others see that evil soul in her? Why is it only you? Let go of me! I am trying to make you understand that there is nothing like that. I can't believe you don't understand. That you don't believe me. Let's just say what you say is true. If nothing like that exists, then what is it that I see... And why is it that I only see it in Rebecca? I don't see it in anyone else... Not my mother, my aunts, or you. Why not anyone else? You can't understand and you never will understand... Until you go through my situation. Amy! Hold on! Okay. Hi, auntie! Hi, Amy! Is Martha home? Uh, yeah, she's inside. We've been so busy this week... Baking and cooking for the Miller's wedding next week. Oh, yeah. Yeah, is Rebecca with you? No, Rebecca has not been feeling well all week. Oh. Rebecca's at home. When she's at home, is she alone? Yes, Rebecca is home alone today, she's resting. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go see Martha. Okay. Have a nice day. You, too. ( Ominous music playing ) ( Flies buzzing ) ( Marbles clanking ) ( Gasps ) By the end ball, everyone will fall. ( Laughs ) ( Dramatic music playing ) I have not come across any such incidents as you've described so far. But let me check. Perhaps I might find some clues. This book explains why any evil possession happens. Evil can only take over when somebody gives way to it. It cannot approach one who walks in the ways of god. But i-- I don't understand. I mean, our community believes that we're different from the rest of the world... Because we follow the way of god so firmly. Isn't that so? No, actually it is not correct. What do you mean? I thought that if we follow the ways of god, that we're fre-- here, let me give you one simple case. The current generation, forgetting the scripture. It states very clearly, keep away from the lust of the flesh. And what are they doing? They are satisfying their lust of the flesh... Breaking the barriers of rumspringa, running around. Well, most come back after rumspringa. The holy scripture denies somebody... Having a physical relationship before the marriage. And have many people fouled. Isn't that giving way to evil? So why does god allow this evil in the world? God does not allow evil, my child. The youth today are addicted to drugs, which is not accepted. It does not mean that god's permitted them to do so. Here, listen. For god created the light... And the action of the light gave darkness. Don't you see, it's only the absence of god in their lives... Which allows them to go ahead with these unpleasant activities. What we call evil, nobody's created it. Ultimately god tests us. ( Soft music playing ) ( Music changes ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Hawk shrieks ) ( Eerie music playing ) Rebecca. No! ( Solemn music playing ) ( Preacher giving funeral sermon ) ( Hawk shrieks ) Amy (v.O.): Rebecca. Rebecca. Amy (v.O.): Rebecca! Preacher (v.O.): May Rebecca's soul rest in eternal peace. Amy (v.O.): The entire village gathered at Rebecca's funeral. Everyone was grieving her death. But I'm worried. I've seen two more possessed. I hope my great-grandfather shows me the way. Robert (o.S.): A little more. Looks like your dream of building this barn... Is really starting to come true, my brother. Almost. When we move from the old barn to this one, we'll have room for eight new cows. New cows are fine, what about the new member in our family? Not just our parents, even our grandfather was asking this morning. When are you getting married, Robert? You have been courting for 15 months now. Yes, I know. I just need more time. Finish this up, please, I've got more chores to do. Opa? Opa. ( Dramatic music playing ) Auntie, how can you say that? I've seen two follow Rebecca today. How many more do I have to see? I have to do something. I'm as much to blame if I keep quiet, I have to do something. You will tell us if you find a way out of this. We will stand by you, I promise you that. I've lost the only person who could show me the way out. My great-grandfather. I wish I didn't have to go through all this. These experiences... Seeing what I see. I've already lost your brother, I don't want to lose you, too. We don't want you to be shunned like Daniel. If you continue-- I know, I just-- I can't help what I see. ( Somber music playing ) Again, you talk about the trees, saying they speak of death. But do I look like an idiot? Listen, Amy, I don't understand why you want to put yourself into some kind of trouble... For something that's not real. Not real? You think I'm just creating this? I don't get it. You and I, we're fine, our families are fine, but if you keep this-- how selfish can you be? Are our families or just you and I more important than everything? Everything? Than our whole community? Than the people that are being killed gradually by the evil? The last thing I want to do is have this kind of conversation with you. You need to take my advice seriously, otherwise-- say it. Well? Say it. Well, I can't continue with this relationship... If you won't give up this behavior of yours. I see. Listen... Amy... I don't want to spend my life arguing with you. I don't, either. But the truth is, Robert... If you can give up our relationship this easily... Then I'm sorry, I can't stop you. In fact, I don't see the point in continuing a relationship... Where the person doesn't believe me, nor understands my pain... Or refuses to do either. So... So, what? Nothing, um... I was... just wondering. All right, goodbye. ( Soft music playing ) ( Music fades down ) Why? Why me? I don't want to see or hear anymore. I don't want to see everybody die. And you have to stop the fall. Please stop the fall. You see the possessed... And hear the voices of the unknown. Yes? Who are you? Let's say I am someone who sees those who see the possessed. You're english. What are you doing here? My name is Christopher. I'm the funeral director in town... It's the only time your village ever needs us. I-- I have to--- I have to go. Amy. ( Ominous music playing ) I can help you. There is no use fighting those who are possessed. You must find the master... The one who is placing these souls into the innocent... And stop him. Someone sending souls? I don't understand, why would somebody do that? If you want your answer... Be at the house 200 yards south of the cemetery. After sunset. ( Ominous music playing ) Well, I have not witnessed any such instances myself... But yes, I have heard about exorcists and rooting out of evil spirits. Mostly from my childhood. So, it's true. They can bring out evil souls and demons. There are, I suppose, legitimate exorcists... But most of them are just charlatans... Preying on those looking for something, anything. I don't know, I'm sorry, but my knowledge is very limited about this. It's okay, oma. I have to know more. Why do you want to know? I-- I was just hoping someone could be of help. ( Soft music playing ) That's all. ( Dramatic music playing ) Christopher (o.S.): Welcome, Amy. How did you know it was me? Come. Christopher (o.S.): Do not be afraid. I'm here to help you. Sit. The person you are searching for knows everything about your village. They do? I must do something very powerful, Amy... And I need your help. Tell me what you need me to do. I need you to close your eyes. This doll represents the person we are looking for. While I chant... I need you to look at every male face in your village. See them in your mind. When I stop my chanting... And when I look at this doll... If that image in your mind is the face that we are looking for... This doll shall fall. When that doll falls... That person will be struck across his face... Leaving a Mark, a noticeable Mark. You must go and confirm this Mark upon this person... And be back to me before sunset tomorrow... So that I may know how to proceed. Okay. I'm ready. Close your eyes. Open your mind. ( Deep chanting ) ( Chanting continues ) ( Chanting intensifies ) Freeze! Look. Freeze that image in your mind. Who do you see? I don't know, it's-- it's blank. It's absolutely a blank. I-- it-- it was no one when you stopped chanting. Look in the darkness. Look in the darkness. See the face! The doll did not fall. Maybe it's not a man. What do you mean? Maybe... it's a woman. A woman. How do we find out? I must do the same ritual, but with a female doll. Okay. I'm ready. It can only happen... Moments after sunset. And those moments just before sunrise. Bef-- before s-- ( sighs ) This is ridiculous. I can't believe I wasted my time. That I actually thought this would give me the answer. You can't fool me anymore. What do you mean? You know, it's really easy to take advantage of someone who's vulnerable. I-- I don't believe in any of this... And I especially can't believe that I was stupid enough to come all this way. I've witnessed enough nonsense already. This is not nonsense. Dolls, sunrise, sunset, chanting, lemons? It's all garbage. I hope you're happy, you took advantage of someone who really needed your help. ( Breathing heavy, running ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Sobbing ) ( Somber music playing ) Welcome, Amy. I've been expecting you. How did you know I'd be back? I knew you'd come back... Like you know you are possessed right now. You must be the only person on the face of the earth... Who knows of their own possession. Well, that's not something to be proud of. I understand. It must be very difficult for you to accept. There are many practices we could do... To control the soul inside you. If there are, please teach me. No. It takes a long time for a soul to grow inside. We must concentrate on the master. That one who is sending these evil souls into your villagers. We will do the same ritual, but this time with a female doll. And as I chant, I want you to see the faces of every female in your village. Young, old, near, far. Do you understand me? Yes. Close your eyes. Open your mind. ( Deep chanting ) ( Chanting intensifies ) Freeze! Freeze that image in your mind! Blank again. The doll didn't fall. Go through the blankness! Go! Look! Go deeper! It's just-- it's smoke. It's just-- go to the smoke! Go! Go into the smoke. Further! Further into the smoke! Go! Further! Further! See a face. ( Gasps ) Don't open your eyes! Don't open your eyes. What do you see? What is it? I s-- I see a bloody hand that's turned into a barren tree. Rebecca. Rebecca. When the tree became barren, Rebecca died. Do you know this tree? Do you know where it is? We must go. Quickly. We haven't much time. Odd. This is dead. Come here. Look at this. It's the same thread. ( Thread twangs ) What happened? It's alive. I don't know. I'm sorry, my limited powers, I can't save you or your village. Well, what do you mean? I mean, I can't control this. This is beyond me. You have to. I mean, what are we gonna do? What's gonna happen to us? But... But what? There is one thing that I can try... And I don't even know if it'll work. Well, we have to if there's a chance? I must use you as my weapon, are you willing to do that? Yes. Are you sure? Yes, if there's a chance. Are you absolutely sure? Yes! Okay. Okay. ( Dramatic music playing ) I know-- I know what I must do. What? I know what I have to do. I have to find the ashes... Of the body of the soul that's in you... And then I can rid you of this evil spirit. Ashes, no Christian cremates their bodies... That means the chances of saving our village are absolutely impossible. No, no, no, this body, it's not of this amish county. It's outside its perimeter, no, this is not impossible. No, this isn't impossible. Take this. Amy, this will protect you of being possessed from this evil spirit. Do not lose it under any circumstance! Do you understand me? Yes! Are you sure? Promise. Have faith. I will. Have faith. I do. I'll return as soon as I can, as soon as I can. Okay. ( Soft music playing ) Amy! Amy, I've been looking for you. Listen, Amy, I'm so sorry for everything that's happened. For what I said. Amy, I know what a great heaviness you've been through. The pain you've suffered, I just didn't understand. I guess... I should explain by saying that there's somebody at home. He's not normal, I'm certain of it. Did you hear what I said, Amy? Amy, my grandfather is possessed. I think my grandfather is possessed. ( Eerie music playing ) ( Man giggling ) Amy! Amy! What's wrong? Why did you run away like that? Please, tell me. What's wrong with my grandfather? He's possessed, isn't he? Let me show you something. Look at this. So what is it? This tree represents one of our villagers. If you look around, you'll see more like this, that's what I was trying to tell you earlier. Each tree represents each possessed person. How can that be? When the tree falls, so does the person. So is one of these my grandfather? I'm sorry, Robert, yes. But it's not just your grandfather. For sure, everyone will fall sooner or later before this fall. Robert. I have to tell you something. What is it? Never mind. What's in your hand? Nothing. Show me what's in your hand. I'm sorry. Robert! What hap-- what happened? Are you okay? Robert! ( Eerie music playing ) ( Soft music playing ) ( No audible dialogue ) ( Eerie music playing ) What is this? Why aren't you properly dressed? Bare feet? If you're hungry, you can get properly dressed before you leave your room. ( Dramatic music playing ) John! John, the table! The table's on fire! What is wrong with you? You've become so negligent about everything, everything! If we hadn't been here, the whole house could have caught fire. I...did...not...do...it. Stop, now! Stop this nonsense. Something is wrong here, I think we need prayers immediately. You're right, something is wrong. Amy, go get the Bible by the window. ( Solemn music playing ) ( Screaming ) ( Eerie music playing ) ( Demonic whispering ) Amy! ( Demonic whispering continues ) ( Choir music playing ) How'd I get here? I summoned you. I've got the ashes. So how do you feel? Strange. I think I lost the bead... When I showed Robert the barren tree. The soul's growing inside me. Mm. ( Deep chanting ) How do you feel now? Much better. Good. I was happy that I got the ashes. Faith. I know who you are. Man's voice: And I know you burnt my body. Tell me who your master is. He is the most powerful. Christopher (o.S.): Tell me who your master is. Never. Tell me who your master is! Never! Your master is a coward if you cannot tell me his name. ( Chuckles ) You are a foolish man. Do you want to see his power? Do you want to feel his power? Do you want to feel his power! Do you want to see his power! ( Growling ) Let her go! Stop! Stop or she'll die! Amy! Amy! I'm not Amy. Let me go to my master! What are you doing? Stop it! I'm trying to save her! And your village! And your grandfather! Take me to your master! Master! Take me to your master! Master! Stop it! Amy! Amy! No, let her go! Let her go! Only I must follow her. You must trust me or she will die! Somebody is using the barren trees to kill your villagers. Yes, I know, I've been there. You must take these strands of Amy's hair and these ashes. You must find the tree that represents her... And encircle the tree with these ashes before the last leaf falls. How will I know which tree is hers? Those strands of hair will lead you to it. Now go quickly! Save your love! ( Wind blowing ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Music continues ) ( Music continues ) ( Ghostly growling ) Enough! Welcome, Chris, I'm glad you're here. I've been waiting for someone to come along who might challenge my abilities. So, we meet. ( Chuckles ) Cute toy. You... are but a mere child compared to my experiences. Oh, Chris, you may have more years ahead of me in experience... But I assure you, I am a master of my craft. Daniel? Daniel. Daniel, my brother. I cannot speak to her, for I've been shunned. I'm not allowed to speak to her... Though I do love my sister. This is how you show your love? You of all people should understand... That one's power is only magnified when they use it on those they love. ( Eerie music playing ) Right here. Why them? Because I hate them. Because of what they did. Chris, do you know I'm not the only person in the world like this? No, no, and this, this is not my fault. I just wanted understanding, but they wouldn't do that. No, no, they-- they punished me. They rejected me, they shunned me, Chris. I had no hand on my shoulders, no one to wipe the tears from my eyes. No, no. And only because I wanted to give the love in my heart to another man. Now, now I just want to give back what was given to me. Maybe a little worse. ( Demonic whispering ) God, her faith is true! Please, show me a sign! ( Eerie music playing ) ( Dramatic music playing ) Wait! Wait! I could talk to them and they may take you back. No, it's too late for that. There's only time for revenge. I can't let you do that. I'd like to see you try and stop me, Chris. I really would. I'm giving you all of my power. With a single touch, he will turn to ash. ( Dramatic music playing ) No, this wasn't supposed to happen! ( Howling ) ( Soft music playing ) Amy. Amy. Amy... it's okay. It's okay. You're all right. You're all right. ( Soft music continues ) Robert, oh, my god! Oh, my god! What happened? What happened? Oh, are you okay? Oh, my god! No, it's-- are you okay? It's proof of his love for you. May you be happy together. ( Maniacal laughing ) ( Eerie music playing ) ( Music continues ) ( Maniacal laughing continues ) ( Music changes )
