MAN: Some fell by the wayside. Some died with a stranger. And wise men have told us their cause was a failure. But they loved dear old Ireland. And they... They never feared danger. I passed on my way. God be praised that I met her. Be my life long or short. [ birds chirping ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ static over radio ] MAN 1 [ over radio ]: All clear. Okay, Michael. In we go. MAN 2: Okay, lads, out. Long or short, Mr. Flynn? Well, it was such a short one last time. [ timer ticking ] [ gunshot ] Land rover! Into the car, quick! Encountering fire. Sector D3. [ gunfire ] MICHAEL: Who's that? MR. TWEENY: My son. The Royal Ulster Constabulary killed him in 1957. [ kettle whistling ] The old man was in the IRA too. Fought the Tans. Where did you see action, Mr. Tweeny? Where did you fight the Tans, Mr. Tweeny? Cork. So did was my grandfather. Third brigade. Tom Barry's outfit. EMMET: So was he. Did you know Seamus Flaherty? He was at Kilmichael when they ambushed the Auxiliaries. No, I didn't, young fella. Still in Cork, is he? No, he went to America. But he's still alive, though. Still a good Irishman. Seamus Flaherty. You sure you don't remember that name? EMMET: His mind is gone. MICHAEL: You don't remember him? Do you know Billy? My son Billy? He is a volunteer, you know. Brave lad, he is. No, I-- No, I don't. I don't know him. Not yet anyway. Brave lad. Here, I'll take it for a while. No, no. I'm fine. [ engine roaring ] Down! Bastards. Let's get the wires back across the border. Why did your grandfather ever leave? MICHAEL: He had too. He shot a policeman during the truce. EMMET: Here we go. Damn this weather. Can't tell if it's an army truck or not. In Nam, a whole village just went up in a ball of napalm for less excuse than that. Why did you enlist? I thought I'd be fighting for my country. [ scoffs ] [ music playing over speaker ] You know what Pat told me the other day? He said there'd been more battles lost in the pubs than in the field. You're a good lad, Michael. I'll tell you the truth. When you joined the unit, nobody really wanted you. You know, an American and all that. This isn't your war. But you've done all right, Michael. You've done all right. Well, I haven't done much really. Well, you know, as anybody else. That's how it is in this side of the border. [ woman singing indistinctly ] I have a brother who's a singer. Finbar's his name. Writes his own songs and plays the guitar. If you ever go to Belfast, you can meet him. Is he in the army? The IRA? Well, he isn't, he isn't. He's a republican, of course. I mean, he wants a united Ireland just like you and me. But he doesn't believe we should be using guns for now. Just politics. That's where he and I differ. Anytime we Irish have played the game using British rules, we've gotten the worst of it. But then, my brother couldn't fight the bastards the way we do. He's nearly blind. He, he, he.

Five people died in a Belfast gunfight. Three of the victims were school children. WOMAN: Good morning, Mr. Cochran. Isn't it terrible about those children? Okay. [ engine roaring ] [ door opens ] Father Regan. Just a word, Joe, before you go in. About Flaherty. You brought that up already? No, no, not yet. It's just that we sent Flaherty up north, he might get captured. Better lock him in tight before it goes. Get him in so deep he can't talk himself out. Right. But Russell would be the safest one to bring the lad north. And it might help to get him a little more respect from the Belfast units. Sounds good. Look, Joe, I hope it's not necessary. But we might have to use Flaherty up. I've been thinking the same. [ indistinct chattering ] Where is the bastard who owns this place? Monte Carlo or Spain? This is a safe house, Sean. The gardai'll think twice before sticking their noses in here. Makes me bloody sick so it does. Never risk a hair on their heads. Trying to convince people they want justice for some poor bugger while they are lolling around in places like this. On or sooner we have a united Ireland. We won't have to be dealing with these bastards, you'll see. As all the children were killed by British bullets, the Brits are gonna say that the young ones were shooting at the soldiers. Is any embarrassing evidence gonna come out, Sean? Anything that might bear out such a claim? No, we're okay there. Besides no matter what the Brits managed to dream up who'd believe it? Exactly. People will believe what they want to believe. Lads. Lads, it seems to me that these shootings, we should exploit them rather than retaliate. What I'm thinking-- Yes, yes, that's obvious, but I'd rather see the British embassy burning again, but a paragraph in a paper that only the Boston Irish read. We need something different now. Something that'll not only keep the momentum going, but gives us an opportunity to collect funds. If it'd have been three dead American children, we'd have all the publicity and funds we need. Well, we have several Yanks working for us now in the border. MAN: You mean suppose one of them got killed by the British? Exactly. How many Yanks are there now, Joe? There's four. Three working out Donegal and one in Monaghan. MAN: Flaherty? Aye, Flaherty. MAN 1: What do you think American reaction might be if one of them did get killed? The three in Donegal, I'd imagine I'd imagine there'd be a cheer in Washington. I've seen bit of action in the U.S. They blew up a courthouse. What about Flaherty? He's okay. Just a lad. Eager to have a go at the Brits. Pat's happy with him. What's his background, Joe? Rich daddy. Thinks he's Irish. The family sends too much cash over to us. I said no when the boy wanted to join. His dad's upped his contributions now that his son is a volunteer. What are you thinking, Pauly? Well, I'm thinking this. If we move young Flaherty up somewhere where he'd be more exposed, say Belfast, and if he was killed or wounded, look at the publicity we'd get. Would help with all the American-Irish and a hell of a lot of young people too. We'd get coverage on the television networks. We could get interviews. Tell them how Flaherty died for what he believed in. Well, that's pretty rough thinking. The lad must believe in the movement or he wouldn't be here. JOE: It is rough. It's a bit devious for me, but Pauly may be right. There's a lot of Irish lads who've died. Good lads. They'll stick out like a sore thumb in Belfast. Especially if he opens his mouth. And if the Brits managed to lift him, they'll raise hell in Washington. And get the U.S. government to clamp down on the groups that supports us. They'll go to the Short Strand. That's as isolated as anywhere. The Farmer. He'd keep him out of sight. Look, I'm not saying, we should prop him up to be shot But let's get him up there and then see. We're going north to lift Billy Stanley. MAN 1: Stanley? Every Wednesday, he visits his sister who has a house just a mile across the border. We are gonna lift him and just walk him back south. MAN 2: How do we stop him? We don't. Michael and me do. Am I in on this? You two will be waiting for us just the side of the border, but it's only Michael and me is going north. MICHAEL: What's this guy done? He enforces British law. Oh, yeah. Heh. Don't think this is my idea. My choice would be to lift this one. Same as always. Together. HQ want Michael in on this. From start to finish. In on the lift and on everything. Don't worry. He's a good lad. He'll be fine. Bastard that he is. Let him see the barrel right up close. And touch his face with it. If he as much as blinks, blow his brains out. Sorry, to block your way there. I got a flat. There's no jack or anything in the truck. I guess I should have checked at it at the rent-a-car joint. Hands on the wheel, mister. Both hands. Hello, Mr. Stanley. Move to the other side, Mr. Stanley. What do you chaps want? You know very well what we want, Mr. Stanley. Just sit still or I'll blow your head off. There's nothing legal about this. You're a kangaroo court. If you kill me, it will be murder. So why play games? The IRA is illegal here in the south too. Your own government put you people in jail. You'd claim to be a man of justice, Mr. Stanley. Perhaps you could explain how in your court Michael O'Sullivan, a man not a member of the IRA but Catholic, was given an eight years prison sentence for being found in possession of three cartridges. While Ian Patterson, protestant, and a confessed driver of a car that carried a bomb to a Catholic pub, a bomb that later exploded, killing six Catholics inside, was given a prison sentence suspended to two years and is now walking about a free man. Is that what you call justice? O'Sullivan not a member of the IRA. Ha! He was as guilty as hell and didn't have the courage to admit it. As I remember, he said the cartridges were planted on him when he was arrested. Oh, rubbish! Ha! MAN: And Patterson? Why, Ian Patterson admitted his guilt. Any lawful court in the world will take that into consideration. You mean to say that if Michael O'Sullivan had pleaded guilty, you would have sentenced him to one year or six months or less rather than the eight years he got even though he is a Catholic? Use his gun, then dump it. You better come with me, Pat. There's no need for three of you. Right. Ted will be waiting for you lads with the car. [ car's doors open and close ] [ car engine roars ] Where? This way. Okay, Michael. You wanna do this? Put another one in him. [ grunts ] Don't worry. That's the first justice that bastard ever saw in his life. Of course, you did it. You did just fine. MAN: He's tougher than I thought. All of us had seen a mate die or blown to bits before we had to put a gun at the back of somebody's head and pull the trigger. He's going to Belfast. Had to make sure of him. EMMET: What? He's gonna be a bit obvious there, isn't he? Well, the Farmer will look after him well enough. The Short Strand, huh? I'd like to have seen the Farmer's lovely puss when he heard that bit in news. An American in the Strand. Well, he just bloody well proved himself to be more than an American, didn't he? Michael. Still want to go north? Have a go at them in Belfast? Yeah. Tomorrow. Are you kidding? Belfast? [ chuckles ] Okay. [ chuckles ] Look up Finbar. I'll do it. ANNOUNCER [ over radio ]: The Provisional IRA has claimed responsibility for the killing of William Stanley, a magistrate, from Brookeborough, County Fermanagh. The body of the magistrate was found this morning near a Scot's house in County Monaghan. The gardai in cooperation with the Royal Ulster Constabulary have detained Frederick Logan of Clones for questioning. And now today's prices on the cattle market. Bullocks-- [ siren blaring ] Do you think we'll have any problems crossing the border in this thing? You and me won't be going across. I'm taking you to one of the bigwigs over in Dundalk. He'll run you over. I don't think there'll be any problem. He goes back and forth every day. JOHN: Wishful thinking, that. What? Is the food no good? Ah, food's all right. He doesn't have any sons nor daughters. He's here. Thanks. Welcome to the movement. It's good to be here. I've just given up smoking. These are the only thing that help. Would you like one? No. Well, come on in. Thank you. Aah, hello. Hello. I'm Mary. You must be Michael. Yeah.Won't you come in? Thank you. I'll pop down to the office and lock up. I'll be right back. Now, don't dally down there now, dear. We have to be leaving soon. We have a function to cater for. Two hundred people. Two pounds a head.Yeah. MARY: Why don't you take a seat there? I'm just going to make a cup of tea. Um-- Okay, anything you got is fine with me. Ahem. There's a telly there on the front room. I think there's an American film on later on. Bend down now and have a look. Ah, here we are. Yeah, it's just on right after the 6:00 news. Doris Day and Rock Hudson in The Pajama Game. I do hate missing that. Doris Day, now, she is one of your finer actresses, isn't she? Rock Hudson. So romantic and gentle. Just love his voice. I guess they're okay. Never really thought about it that way. I'll make up your bed for you now. Oh, I hope you don't mind used sheets. Nah. I'd go broke if I sent them out to be laundered every time. Don't worry about it. ANNOUNCER [ over radio ]: Former SDLP's dormant Senator Patrick O'Brien and Miss Irene Newman, a protestant of Crumlin Road, Belfast, have been found murdered near Belfast Aldergrove Airport this evening. A few hours ago, Belfast RUC headquarters received a telephone call from a man who identified himself as Captain Black of the UFF. He reported the killings and then said, and I quote, "We are not going to stand by and watch while those IRA animals murder people like Billy Stanley. There will be more deaths in reprisal." The murders appear to be ritual killings. Miss Newman's body bore the marks of more than 20 stab wounds and Senator O'Brien had been stabbed more than 30 times in the head and chest, and his throat cut. Don't worry about the border. It's very different from what you might imagine. No, I'm not thinking about that. What's the UFF? UFF. Ulster Freedom Fighters. Extreme protestant paramilitaries, real bastards. I bet O'Brien was playing a very dangerous game. He was trying to build bridges, you know. Yeah. Bit of a red if you ask me. He should have known what he was risking. Thirty stab wounds and a cut throat. Was that it? We just crossed the border? That's right. Oh, that post back there is not manned anymore. Too much of a target. What, they don't stop and check the cars? Sometimes. You never can tell. It's a fine day, sergeant? Nice and dry it is. Would you step out and open up the boot? Sure. There you are. And where are you heading, sir? Oh, just up to Newry. This young man here is on a business from the States. SERGEANT: May I see your passport, please? Sure. Well, Mr. Flaherty, don't let a few mad men spoil your stay here. And when you get back home, be sure to mention the good things. Okay. [ car engine starts ] Who are those guys? Are they British? Well, yes and no. That's the UDR. The Ulster Defense Regiment. They're all protestant and from Ulster. They don't much like the IRA. [ ominous theme playing] Bang! BOY 1: Argh! Search that bastard! [ explosion ] [ Boy 2 mimicking gunshots sound ] [ car horn blares then tires screech ] What the hell do you think you're doing? You should be looking out for cars when you go flying around the streets like that. Are you hurt, Ivor?No. And who are you to tell a child where he should be playing? He knows we always play in the street. And anyway, he was going to fast-- You get home now and look before crossing the street! Look, look, I'm sorry, but I did manage to miss him, didn't I? And bloody lucky you did. Are you two busy planning war to be watching the street in front of you? MICHAEL: Boy, she was a live one. He's damn lucky to be alive. We'll walk from here. Oh, if we meet a patrol, just keep walking. Okay. [ classical theme playing] [ alarm blaring ] Here we are. Hello, John Russell. JOHN: Hello, Gran. Not much security. It's like anybody can walk in here. Don't you believe it. I bet you six people saw us come in here. And any one of them would've sounded the alarm if we have both been strangers. That's good. Tony is around here somewhere too. Probably around the back. And you still have to get pass Granny. You must be kidding. JOHN: It's her husband's. The British gave him six medals in the First World War and hanged him in 1920. All right. You can go in now. Thanks, Gran. Alone. You, young man, sit down over there. HQ is having difficulty with funds from the States. They want military targets to make the fundraising easier. You tell the HQ that if I had more guns and less dynamite, my aim would be more selective. The Yank seems to be a special kind of lad. Special believer, I'd imagine. All the same. I'm sure he'll be a help to you. Anyone can be a help here so long as they're willing to risk their necks. [ door clicks open ] JOHN: Aah. How's it going, lads? Can't complain.Good, good. Well, done. Tell your Yank to wait. I'll see him later. JOHN: Sure, sure. I'll see you tomorrow then, huh? [ door shuts ] Not yet, Michael, he's still busy, but he'll see you later. Somebody will take you over to Mrs. Cochran's after you've talked to him. You're gonna be around? Yeah, till tomorrow. I'll see you before I leave. Keep your head down. Good luck. Same to you. I wouldn't be surprised if it freezes tonight. Good night, Gran. [ door closes ] [ indistinct chattering ] Is this sulfur? Mix them better. My brother always mix them that way. So there's two each. Now, we'll all meet here at 8, and don't be late. Ma won't let me out after dark. I'll sneak out, though. I won't be missing this. [ sighs ] When do I do it? Don't get too anxious. Just leave your hands on the British SLR. They want a bloody slog dog out of them, so get one. No trouble. And stash it. I'll tell you when. There's no guarantee that any of us is going to be around when the order comes to off him. Right. Take him over to Mrs. Cochran's. And he is to stay out of sight. I don't want to see him until I need him. Get that? Right. On your way, then. [ door opens ] Hello, Tony. Gran. You're the Yank. Michael Flaherty. Tony Coyle. So when do I meet him? He didn't say. But he wouldn't, would he? Announcing his moves in advance, I mean. Hello, Tony. This is my nephew? That's him. All the way from America. Michael Flaherty. Heh. Never was a Flaherty in any of our family. Well, there's no point in standing out here. Come on into the living room with you. Okay, thank you. Let's have some light. You'll take a fry? Uh, no. No, thank you. What about you, Tony? You'll be wanting to be delivered with your tea, won't you? Have you got a rasher? No. Just liver. All right. Fair enough. [ sighs ] James Connolly. Aye. [ thudding ] It's all right. That's Siobhan. I know her knock. [ fryer sizzling ] Something's burning. [ indistinct chattering ] She's downtown for Basey and Joe and he says the Danswel send you his love. God knows. Maybe my prayers will be answered sometime. The days go by very slow without him. Sure. They can't keep him in there forever, Auntie Ivy. Ah, they could keep you locked up as long with they like. Bastards. Come on in. Well, actually, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Ah, come on and have a cup of tea. Someone inside you should be meeting. Come on, This is Michael Flaherty from America. Michael's over here to help us. How you doing? [ sizzling ] Holy God... Thank you, Tony. Did you leave your palm trees to come over here and help us? Are you donating blood to the hospital then? Actually, there aren't any palm trees in Detroit. It's a lot like Belfast, a little bit bigger. In fact, things are so good over there, there's nothing much to be done. Go back to America. We don't need any more gunmen here like that one there. I'm not a gunman. All right? I came here to contribute what I can to the cause. Oh, yes, of course. A cause. And you want to be a down payment for the next generation, do you? It's a sick way to put it. But maybe somebody in the next generation will be my son. That's hoping you live long enough to have a son. And even if you do live through it that you won't have so much blood in your hands that you'll know how to stop shooting when there aren't any British soldiers left. IVY: Now, now. What's going on here? University. Siobhan's got herself full of dreams of another life. She's gonna slip out of this place by the backdoor. That's what they're teaching her. You see that, Michael Flaherty? That's the way people who are only good at pulling triggers think here, hit. They hit everyone who isn't doing what they're doing. You probably haven't seen a good man die for nothing yet. But it wouldn't touch that animal. And it doesn't take long to get where he is. Sorry, Aunt Ivy. It's all right, love. MICHAEL: Hey. [ door closes ] [ Michael grunts then Tony chuckles ] TONY: You know what she needs, don't you? Too good for anyone here, she is, though. But in for a surprise one of these days, I'd say, though. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. Oh, Christ. MAN: Come in. Mm. Mm. Right. They're still a bit damp, sir. Well done, sergeant.Thank you, sir. [ door closes ] Has he left yet? MAN [ over phone ]: No, sir. He's still here. Put me through then, will you? COLONEL WYNDHAM: Yes? Oh, Percival here again, sir. Yes, Nigel, what is it? Well, it's just that I can't help feeling that they'd only bring in a Yank for something really special. It would be much too risky otherwise. And it appears he was in Monaghan before coming here, sir. My informant hasn't been wrong yet. All right, Nigel. Just increase the patrols in that area tonight and check with Baspi at the American embassy in the morning. He's a good man. Oh, does your Yank have a name? Yes, sir. It's Michael Flaherty. Good. Thank you, sir. Marshall, Green, you're on patrol tonight. Patrol? Yes, Green. Patrol. You've got exactly one minute to collect your equipment and be in the yard. Move! All loaded, sir. Very well, sergeant. BOY: Did you bring matches? Nah. The Farmer was in the kitchen. I couldn't get any. Great. Let's go. Come on. BOY 1: That's where the bastards were shooting from last week. Let's go. Throw them into the yard. [ explosions ] [ man indistinctly yells ] Brits. Merciful God. Who's dead now? Must be the old store. Get rid of the bastards for me! Kill the bastards! God bless you, lads. Flaherty, go inside. SOLDIER: Jesus Christ. It's a fucking kid. Hold your fire until you've got a target! Cover me! [ gunshots ] [ soldier indistinctly yelling ] Come on! I said move! [ gunfire continues ] SOLDIER: Coming out into the road! [ gunshots ] [ gunfire continues] Hold that. [ gunshot ] Tell the boys I'm gonna cross. I'm gonna get that rifle. SOLDIER: Go to the radio! [ gunfire continues] SOLDIER: Get that bastard! [ woman screaming ] [ bell tolling ] How's Siobhan? "You should have been watching them," she says. She thinks it was all her fault. Just the pain makes people feel like that. We all blame ourselves first. And you start hating. Hating. Praying to God to live long enough to see the bastards pay for their crimes. I wish to hell I could start doing something. Anything. You are very like him, you know. My Gerard, I mean. He always wanted to keep moving too. Hey, that's Emmet. IVY: Emmerton. Finbar Donovan. They were all great friends. [ Michael chuckles ] MICHAEL: Look at those guys. Heh. I had lunch with the brigadier today. He is talking about the SAS again. PERCIVAL: They leave a bloody mess as they always do. It'll take us six months to get back to where we are now. When things get out of control like the other night and 12-year-olds are killed, we become the best recruiting organization the IRA could hope for. Yes. But with the SAS moving there, we are lucky to have five dead children by next week. Ah, they won't have enough guns to arm all their new members. Information, Nigel. Information is what we need more of. We must strike with lethal accuracy every time. And I mean every time, Nigel. Without proper information, we're as graceful as the bloody herd of elephants in a snow drift. I've managed to put the brigadier off his SAS idea for the moment. Ah. But he won't wait for long. He's expecting results and soon. I see. I suggest we put more pressure on the Strand. You say your informant there has never been wrong yet. That's true. Yes. And he's only telling us what he's sure of. I want him in deeper than that. I want you to pick his brains. Then we will decide what to do with the pieces. I see your point, sir. The other thing, lift the first one of those bastards you can lay your hands on. Damn it, man, we've gotta stop photographing them and start netting them down and making them talk. And use the police for the lift. We can't afford a mess at this point. Right, sir. Now, what about the Yank? What have you found out? Vietnam War veteran. Discharged honorably from the U.S. Army about six months ago. He had no technical specialties in the Army so there's no clue there. His family lived in Detroit. They're wealthy, well-connected. Probably second or third generation immigrants. And I think what we have here is just another idealist who's found a cause that fits him. Probably trying to make up for something he didn't feel in Vietnam. Well-connected, you say? Yes. And his family probably make large contributions to various Irish relief organizations. Now, as far as my information goes, he hasn't been seen on the streets since he arrived. Nor has he been involved in any operations yet. Which seems to confirm the notion that he's being saved for something special. Be careful, Nigel. We can't afford a situation which would give the Irish-American press just what they need to triple the IRA's funds. MAN 1 [ over TV ]: But we're doing mostly local patrols for months, but then one night-- MAN 2 [ over TV ]: It's on. Across the border. MAN 1: --our turn for a stint In border patrol. Although it was a break from the retainment, it was no... [ explosion ] [ indistinct chattering over TV ] It was the fastest, toughest 48 hours some of us had ever spent. But when you're helping to put a stop to terrorism... WOMAN 1: Amy! Oh, God! Somebody get an ambulance. [ indistinct chatter ] [ indistinct chattering ] WOMAN 1: Try to be careful, please! Oh. Oh, God! Over here... [ indistinct chatter ] WOMAN 1: Oh, my God. WOMAN 1: Get her, please. Finbar. Who are you? What do you want here? Michael Flaherty. I'm staying at Mrs. Cochran. I never saw you before, and I live across the street from her house. [ women indistinctly speaking ] WOMAN 2: A real bastard. Hold it! Hold back! Best get out of here. The police will be here in a minute. Christ! Back to Mrs. Cochran's. This time you're gonna stay there. I heard the explosion. You're meant to obey orders. When the hell am I gonna meet the Farmer? [ chuckles ] [ siren wailing ] How long ago was he lifted? About four or five hours. His wife hasn't seen him since he left the house this morning. And last time I saw him was a couple of hours after the explosion, about noon. Nobody has seen him since. Double patrol the other night. Liam and all his jelly. And now Quinn lifted. We have a leak. You reckon? Two bull's-eyes in a few hours. That's more than luck. Losing Liam and all the jelly he was sitting on knocks the hell out of us. He breezed the police stuff. And if you think that was an accident, how can you explain that they've managed to lift Quinn from right under our very noses in broad daylight. I don't know. It's the leak we have. So we have to scrap all the operations we've planned. A few new projects with the jelly we have. Eyes open, mouth shut. And then when the fucker shows his foot here, he can start praying. Oh, it's you, Father Jameson. This is a nice surprise. Won't you come in? Mrs. Cochran, I'm looking for Siobhan. Is she here?She is indeed, Father. Come on in. Thank you. It's about the masses for little Ivor. I couldn't really trouble her poor mother about that. No. Tell me, how is Siobhan faring? Ah, the poor child has been in a terrible state, Father, but thanks be to God, I think things have taken a turn for the better. SIOBHAN: You really want to change the world? No. I think it's great just the way it is. [ Michael chuckles and Siobhan laugh ] Siobhan, does the soul good to hear that laugh. And who is this young man I've never seen in my church. Michael Flaherty. American.Yeah. That explains it. I can't be affected to draw them in from so far away. And I know. And tell me, what brings you to the hallowed Belfast, Michael. Michael is over here to help us. Are you now? Are you a doctor then? Ha, get away with you, Father. I was making tea. Will you stay and have a cup? Yes, I will. Thank you. Give me a chance to get better acquainted with the newest member of my parish. Seeing as how I lost two more today. Maybe you're more interested in souls like meself. IVY: I'm out of sugar, Father. I'll just pop a flash to the shop. Won't be a minute. Ah. I believe I've got it now. You're a man of reason. I should have guessed that before. [ door shuts ] It's reason we're in shorter supply of the Northern Ireland. I'm here to do something that the church never got around to doing. Helping these people. Helping kill more. SIOBHAN: He hasn't killed anyone, and that's more than you can say for the British. Sure. British. It's no wonder people turn to the IRA. Any port in the storm. Are you turning that way now, Siobhan? Go home to America. You'll only add to madness here. We've enough killers as it is. You know you're nothing but a parasite. Living off death and fear. Living off death? So that's what you call it. Yeah. You may as well be British man. In fact, when they go, you're gonna have a tough time filling your church. You'll be out scouting for Americans then. Well, I'll tell you something, Michael Flaherty. From the sound of it, you'll fit in very well here with all your hatreds. God only knows we've enough of the likes of you. Godless men with all the answers. And guns in their hands. And blood, the streets leak with it. And your kind wading through just looking for glory. Pass the plate. Heh. That's not me. I'm not looking for glory. I just know who my enemy is. And there's something sweet in that. It has nothing to do with hate. It's more like a job, without doubts. I don't have any doubts, Father. Your kind's worst enemy are yourselves. Oh, no. You can see my enemy any day of the week. British soldiers marching up and down your street. You say the wrong thing, you stick your head out at the wrong moment and they'll blow it off legally. And you think when you change the uniforms, the rules change too? No, not the rules, just the reasons. And that's more than enough for me. [ kettle whistling ] [ door shuts ] IVY: It won't be long now, Father. Won't you sit down? I'm sure you've been on your feet all day. On my knees with Liam Riley's mother. Living off death. Father, she probably can't afford sugar. Why don't you do without this time. I know you have a sweet tooth, Father. Nothing. I questioned him for six hours without a break. Then he managed to slip out a razor blade concealed in his collar and slashed himself to bits. I've no choice, but to send him off the hospital. Nothing about the explosion? Nothing about the American?Not a word. The worst of it is, my informers are now in a blind panic. Says that lifting this Quinn chap is sure to make them suspect they have a leak. What do they think we're paying him for? To sit in his living room and watch the telly? Look, I've an idea. I mean, if they are aware they have a leak, we can make them believe that the American is to blame. Well, that will cover our man for the moment. Then when they dispose of the American, Irish American executed by the IRA? Unless matter was correctly handled by the press. [ soldiers speaking indistinctly ] They made a hell of a noise in here. FINBAR: More like a scream. You think the Brits knew what was going on over there? No idea. Actually, who but Liam knew what was going on. Came in here every day. Always asking me to sing "Tipperary." Heh. Poor devil. I bet he never even been to Tipperary. Probably not. But from the way he went, I say there's a bit of him there right now. Yeah. Well, I better be off. What do you charge for these? Uh, polar mint, sir. Five p each. All right. Good luck, Finbar. Poor old Liam. [ door shuts ] [ strumming ] [ humming ] ♪ Death looms Above the town ♪ ♪ Seeking victims Silently ♪ ♪ Unseen [ humming ] ♪ Children come To view the night ♪ [ humming ] ♪ We feel the corpses ♪ Silent, helpless ♪ Scream It's a nice life. Sleeping all day. Anyways we'll stay put. You can spend the whole day there as far as the Farmer's concerned. He's busy. Hey, Tony. You can tell the Farmer that if he doesn't have anything for me, I'll pack up and go where I'm needed. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. You saw what can happen the other day. You just tell The Farmer that I'm tired of waiting around. And tell him I wanna see Finbar. Finbar. Yeah. Is that bad for you? Him seeing you here. Well, bad for them I should think with the picture he'll paint. He might even get them to find some use for you. [ chuckles ] Accidents do us more damage than the British. What makes you think it was an accident? Do you mean to tell me that the Brits got in there and managed to blow that building and Liam Riley's bones to bits? Without anyone seeing them go in or out? It's a bit far-fetched. How did they manage to lift Quinn without a trace? It's quite simple. We have a leak. Could be. What about Quinn? It might have been convenient to get lifted like that. Just after the explosion. Quinn's in the hospital half dead. The court didn't get a word out of him. By the way, what's this about the Yank getting roughed up. Why don't you tell the locals who he is? Look, I don't rub elbows with HQ staff. So you just do what you're suppose to be doing, right? Keeping HQ informed and getting us the equipment we need. So far, I haven't been blinded by astonishing results. So just leave running sea brigade to me. Hello, Tony. TONY: Hello there. Patrol. [baby crying ] Hi, Rose. Hello. [ crying continues ] Coyle, take your shovel. Strip together enough jelly to make a good sales package. I want it ready for tomorrow morning. What about detonators. FARMER: They're already over there. Right. I'm off then. FARMER: You knew Finbar. Well, I worked with his brother, Emmet, down south. Emmet. This is a war, Mr. Flaherty. Yeah. I'm aware of that. I came halfway around the world to fight in this war. It's something I believe in. It's something I'm willing to risk my life for. You can't stuff me in a house like this. You saw what happened out there. Who's gonna lead you around? How about you? Why can't I start working with you? All you gotta do is let the locals know I'm okay. After that, I can take care of myself. Look, after the other day, everybody knows who you are. You're lucky I happened along, very lucky. Yeah. What did you bring me up here for? Look, get Siobhan to take you over to Finbar's. And I don't care how willing you are to take risks. I don't want you stopped by a patrol. Is that clear? Yes, fine. So when do I start work? Soon enough, Flaherty. Soon enough. [ door slams ] He looks like a good lad, and he's been working with Emmet. Why don't we use him at the rail yard? I don't like the idea of dead Americans, Nigel. We're getting enough problems with America as it is. You think we can get the IRA to kill him, which is fine. But if they thought the British Army killed one of their citizens, that would make it very difficult. Very difficult indeed. So they're planning a big operation. The sort of operation I'm sure they have been saving this American for. And this is our chance to hit them from all sides. I think we can take out that whole Short Strand unit in a night. Okay, Nigel. It's worth a try.Thank you, sir. And one more thing. Yes? The police do the first stage. Pick-up. Mac Whirter has put a Special Branch unit at my disposal. Very well, Nigel. But if this blows up in our faces, the Brigadier will have my head and I'll have yours. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. You got the numbers?Sure. Keep an eye here. [ line ringing ] [ coins clinking ] MAN [ over phone ]: Belfast Telegraph. Hello there. There's a bomb. Donegal Place, 15 minutes. Hello? Could you repeat that? Yeah. [ line ringing ] [ clears throat ] There's a bomb. Donegal Street, 15 minutes. Violence won't work in Ulster. We're outnumbered, 2 to 1. We lose that way. And the idea is to win. Win what? You're not gonna take a thing from the British that you don't take. Who started the violence? Who shot Siobhan's little brother? The IRA? Uh-uh. Oh, Michael, you sounding very much the Irishman. Slipping into the past like that. Always the past, never the future. Past is easy. It's horrible enough that no Irishman can be blamed for lingering there, but it's not enough. It's not enough. Well, from what I've seen, you won't get the Brits out of here with that song. You're sounding more Belfast by the minute. Oh, hell. Belfast. I'd like to go back to Monaghan. They'd put a bullet through your knee if you did that. You'd be a deserter. Oh, they sure were anxious enough to get me up here in a hurry. I'm sick of waiting around here. Two weeks sitting around doing nothing. Heh. From what I can see, blind as I am, it doesn't look as if you two have been exactly idle. Look, Michael, the Farmer can't use someone who doesn't know Belfast. Well, I'm not gonna get to know Belfast stuck away at Mrs. Cochran's. Being stuck away like that is a part of life in Belfast. [ explosion ] Here we go again. It's the same as usual. We got out of the area and I phoned two warnings. The Telegraph and the army. FARMER: Are you sure you made the two calls? I'm sure. What about getting the place wrong? The paper said that whoever made that call said Donegal Place, not Street. I said Donegal Street. I made two calls and I told them both where the bomb was. Do you think I wanna be blowing up people if I'm not sure they're Protestants? [ chuckles ] The papers are wrong. All right, Tony, you can go. [ chuckles ] [ door slams ] It's him, isn't it? Maybe. One thing is sure. He is used up. He's looking that way. It's a good job he doesn't know about the rail yards. [ tires screeching ] Hold it there, Granny. Easy now. We don't want anyone running with warnings, do we? [ guitar strumming ] Okay, you. You're going on a wee trip. Me? You got a warrant? Have you got a warrant? We do, surely. Ha-ha-ha. I'll bet you're a wiz at reading. Come on! All right, on your way, Granny. Way on, go on. [ car engine starts ] [ clanking ] What's that? It's a warning. There must be a raid going on. I better get home. [ clanking continuous ] [ door opens ] IVY: Michael. Michael. What's the noise for? They've lifted Finbar. God protect him. Finbar? FARMER: He set the timer near the call. The Brits must be lying. SEAN: Tony Coyle. Is he the leak. I don't know. He's used up anyway. He could have said Donegal Place. I wouldn't let it pass him. Can we trust him to do Flaherty? He'd be delighted. Make you sick the way he loves that trigger. Well, he's the man for you all right. Well, then, it would be his last job. Is it wise for you to be offering this job? Well, it's better than hanging around here. Putting bullets into Yanks, so that those brilliant men in HQ can clear their television war. And that bullocks Whirter. What's he always sent around here for? He's been sucking Hanlan's elbow for quite a while now. Boy scout who happened to be on staff. Don't let him get on your nerves. Ignore him. But if he starts giving orders around here one day, by Jesus, I'll emigrate. [ door opens ] Finbar has been lifted. We know, Tony. I have a job for you tonight. You still have that Army SLR? Sure. Flaherty? Afterwards, I want you over the day brigade for a few weeks. [ screaming ] [ Finbar gasps ] He wants to watch. He is afraid his cover might be blown. He wants to make sure this scheme will work. Oh, well, I don't mind. He's working for me too, isn't he? [ screaming continues ] That one wouldn't recognize his own mark. And he was standing right there in front of them. [ whimpering ] That's enough of that. Take his straps off now. You know why you're here, you bastard? [ pants ] No. Tell us about the bomb factory right across from that shitty little shop of yours. Who used it? They were in and out of your place all the time. FINBAR: I don't know. What do they use now? I don't know. [ whimpers ] Now, look at me when I'm talking, you little cunt. Look at me. Hmm? Look at me. Ha-ha-ha. That's right. [ sighs ] All right, get him up. Put him on a chair. If you like a fag, here. Strokes, is there still some tea in that pot? Yes, sir.Oh, give him another cup then. Oh, and move his chair up to the table. It's there, right in front of you. Don't you want any more tea, lad? I changed my mind. Oh, that's up to you. I mean, if you don't want it, you don't want it. Like playing the guitar, I hear tell. Pity you lost that. It's about all you had left, wasn't it? [ screams ] [ breathing heavily ] Well, we certainly can't complain about Flaherty's information. He's put it right on the button every time. Damn shame Quinn pulled that razor. I almost had him.It doesn't matter. With what Flaherty has told us about the Farmer and the sea brigade, we've gotta clean up the whole Strand. Two days at the most. [ Finbar groans ] I don't think this bastard knows anything. No, neither do I. Then let him go. Right. Okay. [ Finbar groans ] I'll have to get him to sign something in both hand. Except over his feet or something. Right. [ whimpers ] Okay. We're gonna let you go. [ groans ] Oh, we'll got a doctor come and look at your hand. You had a nasty fall you had there. Very nasty. [ pants ] Ah, it'll settle all right. You'll be playing the guitar again in no time. Not Michael. What did you say? It wasn't Flaherty. What wasn't? [ stuttering ] The informer. It wasn't Michael. Who was it then? He's standing over there. Sold this-- Polar mints. John Russell. [ rain pattering ] [ train horn blows ] Are you sure they always change the guard at 8:15? It's been that way as far back as a watchman can remember. Then something's wrong. MAN: Yup. Jesus. [ indistinct yelling ] [ thunder rolling ] Perfect drop. Russell. Remember that. If any of those comes out of it. Is Michael up? Yes. Going to have a go, are you, Tony? I am. Michael. Michael? Come on. Should be a few patrols around. We'll scout out and see what we can find. [ cocks gun ] But where's my weapon? Here. Tony. Look, we're both fighting for the same thing, okay? Sure. Okay. You hear about Finbar being lifted? Yeah. What do you think they want with him? What the fuck do you think they want with Ireland? [ thunder rolling ] You move along that side there and see what you can see. Right? Okay. See anything? No. What the f--? HQ doesn't want you around. You have more use to us dead. It's public relations. Do you get it? It's a British bullet. [ clicks ] You'll never make it. [ grunts ] [ thunder rumbling ] I never saw this coming, you know. I gotta see Emmet. You can't do that. Why not? I know he's not in on this. For God's sake, Michael, don't you understand? If they decided you had to die, there was a reason for that. And you shot the man they was sent to do it! Now, you can't change that! You've got to run! No way. Anybody looking for you, they expect you to head south to the Republic. So we'll go north to Larne. And you can catch the ferry to Scotland. That way you won't have to cross any borders. Words. What do you mean words? I hear your words. Public relations. Jesus. [ upbeat music playing over speaker ] Hey, watch where you're going. Hey, you cunt. Don't tempt me man. Don't fucking tempt me! Taxi. Hey! Hey! Fuck you! Bastard! It's all right, Michael. It's not that far. [ Michael sighs and then sniffs ] We better get off this street. [ man speaking indistinctly over radio ] [ man continues speaking indistinctly over radio ] CONDUCTOR: Tickets, please. What? I left my prints on Tony's pistol. Tickets, please. The army got a couple of terrorists back there. You'll be all right, won't you? No. No, I won't. Oh, Siobhan. Please don't. Don't. I'm sorry, Mike. I don't want to make things worse. Hey, Siobhan, you'll come, won't you? Yes, of course, I will. Michael. That's fine, sir. Thank you, sir. [ slow theme playing] Michael? Michael. Hi, Ginny. Michael, I knew you'd be back. I'm so sorry. What are you sorry about? Your grandfather. Don't you know? No. [ door shuts ] Oh. [ clock ticking ] [ wheezing ] Michael. Michael. Michael, it's not healthy you're grieving like this. Come down and get something to eat. Please. You need something in your stomach. I'll be down. [ door closes ] I'm far away. You don't believe that, do you? Everyone knows I helped you get away. Well, I'm sending you-- I'm gonna send you an airplane ticket. Siobhan? Please, Siobhan. Please don't cry. Please. I just want you to come be with me. If I come, I'll never be able to come back here. Well, in a couple of days, we're gonna have to work this thing out. Um... My grandfather's dying. I don't know... There's just so many things... [ sobbing ] Yes, I will. But you've got to give me some time. I do too. I do too. [ sniffles ] [ crying ] [ engine roaring ] [ sobbing ] [ car door opens and closes] Bastards. Bastards! You filthy bastards! [ clock ticking ] SEAMUS: Michael? Michael. Grandpa. I'm right here. Right here, Grandpa. Can you hear me? [ wheezes ] Did you kill lots of those British bastards for me? Yeah, just like you said it would be. Did they remembered me? The lads? Did they remember? Remember me? Yeah. Huh? They sure did. They sure did. You know Sean Tweeny? Barris Collum. Yeah. He remembered you. Sean Tweeny. Heh. He remembered me. Oh, yeah. Heh. He remembered a lot of the stories that you used to tell me. [ coughs ] All the great things that you did. He said he never knew a better man than Seamus Flaherty. And I fooled them all, haven't I? Yeah. What do you mean? Fooled them. Everybody Yeah. It was a steppingstone. That's what it was. Collins. Collins always called it that, and he was right. What are you talking about? Um, steppingstone... What do you mean by fooled?Steppingstone. [ groans ] [ wheezes ] They captured me. Captured me. Said they'd lash me to a mime-- Mime if I didn't help. Help them. Yeah. So I helped them. And then they told me that I had to help more and more but they tell everybody that I was an informer. This is a dream? Is this a dream you had? No. No. Well, Grandpa, wh--? You know what you're saying? You--? Yeah. You're telling me that you were an informer? [ panting ] Grandpa... So they remembered me, huh? Nobody there ever heard of you. Nobody. It's all the same, isn't it? It means that nobody knows. Except me and now you. You and me. Well, did you tell the others that they had forced you to talk? Did they not understand that or something? Understand what? That you've been forced to talk. Uh, they can't blame you for that. By the time I got out... The time I got out, it was too late. They'd already hang Billy. [ wheezing ] My best friend. Shot Patty too. Besides which I... I got to thinking. Maybe it wasn't such a bad treaty. I mean-- No. You can't fight forever. Why did you tell me all those stories when I was a kid. I went over there to be like you. I've always wanted to be like you. I thought you were a great man. I had to. I owed. I don't wanna die owing. What, me? You owed my life! [ clanging and banging ] [ Michael yells ] [ wheezes ] [ melancholic theme playing] [ ominous theme playing] Why not? Why not, lady? What's the matter with you? Did I do something wrong to you? Did I do something to you? I'm very sorry. I'm just walking here, okay? OPERATOR: I'm sorry, sir. I can't get you a Belfast number now. All the other overseas circuits are busy. Try it again. Sir, the circuits are all busy. Try it again. Look, sir, I can't be trying this all day long. [ grunts ] [ melancholic theme playing]
