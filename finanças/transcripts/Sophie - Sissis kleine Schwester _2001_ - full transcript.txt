[Sophie - Sissi's little sister] Sophie of Bavaria grows up carefree. You are the future queen. Promised as bride to Ludwig II., I do not want to be a queen. she meets the commoner Edgar by accident. I am madly in love, Nadine, and I need your help urgently. A deep love begins to blossom between them. Love is worth fighting for. But the society of their time stands against them. She's The King's bride! - This is about my happiness. Public policy and ambition of her parents force Sophie and Edgar to keep it a secret. Well, you can't give The King of Bavaria a knock-back, Sophie. But Sophie's will is stronger and she secretly meets with Edgar. Watch now the second part. Mister Ratzki came at such a late hour because he wants to resolve a completely unbelievable intrigue before it attracts increasing attention. Our Sopherl hase rode out at night all alone more often. That alone says nothing at all. I heard it through the grapevine, Highness, that tonight you supposedly had a meeting with an unknown man. To disprove these opprobrious allegations, I spared neither time nor effort. It was even said that it had come to a clearly intimate situation. That is not true. We did not even hug although I wished for it so much. I just do not love Ludwig. But I never wanted that you get to know it like this. Good heavens. If you would now maybe be so kind and would leave us alone. The police is answerable to the royal regiment. You will understand that I, of course, have to inform His Majesty The King. That is your duty. Sophie. Do we know him? Mummy does. Who is it? The photographer. Edgar Hanfstaengl. For God's sake, Ludovika! I am so sorry. And out of everyone, with a common rascal. That must be the...the son of Franz. But daddy, did you not always say one should follow their heart? And did you not also promise me that I do not have to marry anyone I do not want? Daddy? Gentlemen, I only know to report that His Majesty The King of Bavaria and Princess Sophie had the engagement resolved consensually. It is said that idle heads found opportunity to spread plenty of crazy rumors among the masses. Those rumors are not a matter of interest for His Majesty. Ah what? There's talk of a secret lover of the princess. I assume that none of you seriously considers to doubt the honor of the princess. The King of Portugal retracted his invitation. The Württembergs also want to distance themselves for now due to the given circumstances. Denials over denials. Apologies. The photographer Hanfstaengl from Munich is here and wishes to ask for your daughter's hand. We do not receive this person. - He does not let himself turned away again. I order that he will be chased away from here because a disaster happens. No. That's enough. - Max! Max, you will stay here! Max! Good morning! All of the flower beds have been wasted by the storm last night. It is nearly noon. Do you not want to get out of bed at all? It is senseless anyway. You must learn to look into the future again, Sophie. And additionally someone who still takes a great interest in you wants to talk to you. Allez! As it seems, I will not just dream about you. Special edition! Special edition! Princess Sophie marries Ferdinand of Alençon. Special edition! - Hey! Wait a moment. Special edition! Special edition! [Wedding of Duchess Sophie in Bavaria! Her Royal Highness Sophie Charlotte Auguste, Duchess in Bavaria, marries Ferdinand Louis Philippe d'Orleans, The Duke of Alençon!] First he snags the fox from us and now also the most coveted girl of all. Please warn us about your next chess move. Feats, my dear friends, there have been many in this house already. Weddings. Births. And because this weddings wasn't such an easy birth we are especially happy that you are all here to celebrate today. To cut a long story short: Let's eat! Never ever I will pay that much of a dowry. Then we will inform our guests that the wedding with my son will not happen anymore. No, thank you. What is with you? I will go to sleep. Should I come with you, Sopherl? - No, thank you very much. I will accompany my bride. Sophie! You are not my husband yet! I will wait with joy. What if I do not find him? - You must find him. If he does not come tonight, I am lost. Please, please, please, please, please do it. And when you come back, go through the back. Imagine all the guests... That's a high price. For my other daughters, the dowry was never over 50,000 Guilders. It is your choice. When they made the dress, I wished all the time that you would be the first one to see me in it. I want to be your bride for once/one day. - You will be, Sophie. We just have to find a way. And I promise you... Who are you? Ratzki is my name. Just freshly promoted. And bent on continuing to take care for the country's inner security. Forgive me but I do not completely understand. What is the point of this? The room of your fiancée, duc. You must request admission from your fiancée and compromise her. Are you mad? After such a faux pas, tomorrow's wedding would never happen. You want to marry her regardless? She appears to me like a very sick soul. I know the address of a good neurologist. Professor Kraft-Ebing in Graz. Who already attended to some subversive broads. Maybe I should check on my daughter once again if she feels better by now. But my son also has not returned. I think for once we should leave them completely alone in their happiness. Sleep well. I congratulate you to your son, duc. Thank you very much, madam. Now the evening can begin for real. Play something funny! Hey. Did you sleep well? Look. That is my wedding present. It shall always protect you and bring you luck. And I have nothing for you. You do. The ping-pong ball. We have to go. But be careful. Highness. Yeah Sopherl? You are already wearing your dress. Do not make such a face now. It will not become that bad. Good morning, Highness. They caught him. Oh God. What happened? Don't worry. After the wedding we'll immediately send for a doctor. But until then you'll stay he for now. Well, I'm leaving. Dry up! Take good care of him. Hey, what do you think about that? Dearest Isolde. Nice to see you. And so I ask you, duc d'Alençon, do you want to take the here present Sophie Charlotte Auguste, Princess in Bavaria, as your wife? Love and honor her, for better for worse, until death do you apart? Yes. And do you, Sophie Charlotte Auguste, born Princess in Bavaria, want to take the here present duc d'Alençon as your husband? Love and honor him, for better for worse, until death do you apart? Yes. I do. [Literally: I want to.] No. Where are you going? I have no idea. I can't breath anymore. Take care of yourself. [Paris, 25 years later] Maman? Louise. How nice that you came. And where is Emmanuel? Uhm, he unfortunately did not have time. He sends his kind regards to you. He absolutely had to go to an event at the Sorbonne. And he is so close to his final exams. He did not want to. He is scared of meeting of you. Maybe he will come the next time around. Sure. Love is worth fighting for. Because everything is as fleeting as grass, even humans. They will endure the same as the flower in the steppeland. A hot wind comes. It is already gone. And where it stood no trace of it is left behind. Only if we love, we are immortal. Now that your father has died, it is easier for me to talk to you about my life with your father. Yeah and why we two were only allowed to see each other so rarely. He brought me to Vincennes like prey. There I sat now and did not dare to look at your father due to fear I would burst. I felt like a brave little soldier because I burdened all of that just to save my beloved. Papa only ever spoke kindly about you. He was so sad. I believe he loved you very much. I know. Back then I was young. Young and foolish. Just like you. My grandfather. King Louis Philippe. One of the richest and most powerful men of his time. Until he could no longer withstand the irrationality and stupidity of the rabble. His wife Marie-Amélie, daughter of The King of Neaples. Soon the pictures of our children will hang next to them. I would like to see my room. Come. Go now. Did you never love him? We did arrange ourselves. - I do not understand. How do you mean that? The coachman will drop you off at the market. I still have business to attend to. How could I have recognized him behind all these others who decided for us? And why did you not leave him then? Maybe it was false bravery. Or maybe I was just too much of a coward. Also, I was not completely alone. There was Nadine. There was somebody else too. That...that cannot be. Wait. Sophie! Padre? Principessa Sophie. Principessa, what are doing here? How nice to see you again, Principessa. Duchesse d'Alençon. I...I heard that our dear Duke had married. But I did not suspect that you... Come. I am sorry to hear that your hopes have not come true. After my departure from Possenhofen I thought a lot about our meeting. Again and again I had to ask myself if back then my advice to fight for love had been the right one. It was. I do not regret a single moment I was allowed to spend with Edgar. And that we meet again here out of all place, yeah that appears to me to be a sign that it is worth to not give up. It cannot be a coincidence that our paths cross again. And what about Edgar? I wrote letters to him. Everyday. Yeah and? Did he not answer? I never sent the letters. I did not dare. Furthermore, what should I have done if he had answered to me? What do you think he does over there? Maybe he is mad and immures people. I do not believe that. A nursery? He was so lonely, and it was my fault. What did you think then? He bored me. I even took pity on him. But at the same time, I was completely incapable of being there for him. Unfortunate that your effort put into the nursery was for nothing. What? We will not have children. What? Did they not tell you? I cannot bear children. That is not true. Thus you will be the last of your kind. No! No, no, no! No! No, no, no! - No. Stop. Stop. No. Stop. It hurts but it will be better in a moment. The pains at the back were not bad. Bad was only our distress. And that we were so incapable of helping ourselves. And then you came. You were such a lovely and happy child. You and your brother nearly saved us with your love. Louise, you forgot the flower bouquet for granny and grandpa. Louise! You are this big, yeah? And how pretty you are, Sopherl. - We were so excited. Louise could barely wait anymore. No wonder that the daughter has no eye for the father then. Yeah Sopherl. Where is your other little one? The wet nurse is in the house. She just fed him. - Your mother always thought you couldn't have children. Now she has two. You see. - No, privy councillor Fischer claimed that. Not I. Yeah, yeah, yeah, always the gentlemen doctors. Oh, Ferdinand and Nadine are coming as well. Welcome in Vincennes. What happened to daddy? He is unrecognizable. - Oh it is a cross to bare. The effects of his stroke afflict him and his heart. And we only receive bad news at Possenhofen. Sisi is now in Greece. That is how sick she is. And no one knows what it really is. And poor Marie and her Francis also do not get some rest in Rome. The throne of Neaples is lost forever thanks to Garibaldi. Bravo. Your sister all have such a hard lot. You cannot believe how happy your father and I are that you are doing so well here. Take a look. This Prussian boy, this Bismarck, fools us all. And turns Napoleon, this [French insult], as well as Gramont, a no less than brain softened foreign secretary, into puppets in his game. For which your music crazy Ludwig will pay his South German, Catholic price as well. Forgive me, duc, I do not really understand you. What game does Bismarck supposedly play with us? Look, the French and the Prussians once again are madly at loggerheads. And Bismarck tries to pull us Bavarians into it as well. And that means as much as that your family could already belong to the enemy by tomorrow. I think we should drink to that. To that that may never happen. Cheers! Anton has withdrawn his Leopold already anyway as a marriage candidate. Just like your Napoleon had wanted it. Just like Bismarck had wanted it. I heard news today that to my greatest regret make me feel obliged to entrust you to depart as soon as possible. Why? The declaration of war from the French side is only a matter of hours now. Yes? Forgive me that I disturb at such a late hour. - But you do not disturb. Please take a seat. I... wanted to talk to you alone once again. I wanted to ask you if you really are doing fine here. Magnificently. And with Ferdinand? You always despised him so much. - You did choose for me. He is a good father. Are you still mad at me? What you told us children was a lie! Or you did just betray us because you did not watch out for us in the right way! I'm so sorry. All of my children. I'm sorry. I miss you so much. I'm so worried. Au revoir, mon bébé. Au revoir. Bon voyage. - Thank you for everything well. Ma Louise. Adieu. Thank you for everything. And can you deliver this letter? Please. Thank you. Bye! Bon voyage. Yeah, you are doing amazing, my dear. Yes. He should watch so he learns it too. Do you still need something? Uhm...please get me all newspapers you can get. I want to know if it is true what The Duc told. Please take the whole afternoon off. She only has eyes for the children anymore. It is not right what is happening to us. Not right? Max? Long time ago. Our two children... I have something for your son. Do you want to come in? Who was this? All men between 16 and 60 have been conscripted for the war against France. They also asked for you. They want you as a photographer in the war zone. I'll surely not go to war for the country that made my love impossible. Oh you will like I know you. Unfortunately. - Why? I must go to her. I waited on an answer from Edgar, not knowing where to get it from and the war came closer and closer. I thought myself to be pretty foolish for the letter I had given my father. The Germans invaded France. And you could already nearly hear their guns. And then the day came on which I had to say goodbye to the only friend I still had. You had yourself be transferred to Paris? Yes, I was offered the conduct of the Dominican monastery rue Saint-Honoré there. A long-standing dream of mine. Not that. Now you will leave me as well. Yes, I do not get news from Possenhofen anymore because the messengers cannot get past the frontlines anymore. Everything breaks. Sophie. Come here. Be calm/quiet. I will always be with you. Edgar? We must confess it to her. Because I cannot bear lying. And because I love you. And... because I am expecting a child from you. What? We are having a child. If you want to disolve your marriage, it will not hurt her because she does not love you and we can live together. Who do you think you are? You are mad. You do not believe that I...love someone like you. Let go of me. My beloved... - Do not touch me! Ferdinand! Do you love him? I did not want to go behind your back. I swear it by God. I would got to hell with you. That is how much I worship you. You followed me to hell, Nadine. I will never forget you that, no matter what you could do to me. Help! I do not know what I could have done to prevent the catastrophe which we ran to without noticing. Maybe I should have interpreted the signs better. Padre. You must take Nadine with you to Paris. She is expecting a child and I want it to be born in safety. [My dear Edgar,] [Cannot read it but probably some lovey dovey stuff] Did you hear something from the frontline? - No but I don't have such big ears like you. How far is it still until Vincennes? - About two days' march. Why? - Just curious. Just curious? Just curious. Good day still. - Thanks. Where have you been so long? At church. All of the suitcases... Jean Paul does not speak a word with me. And here... What happened? This is something I found. A bunch of. Give it to me immediately. Give it to me! Give it to me! Give! Where are we driving to? Stop! Identify yourself, monsieur. Our papers of identity, certified by the United German Confederation. My wife, Princess Sophie in Bavaria and I, duc d'Alençon, are politically neutral. We have the permission to freely travel everyhwere. I wish Their Highnesses a comfortable journey. Merci. Let them pass. Much later, already at the convent, I received via abbot Pierre a letter from your father's administrator that after our departure a Bavarian soldier roved around the area and asked for the masteries. I always firmly believed that this soldier had been Edgar. Come on, come on. Quick, quick. Where are the masteries? What do I know? They're gone, fleet. I am so happy you are here. Maman. It is shameful how much one can fail one another. And it was shameful what he did when he took you away from me. Where are we? - You have arrived. No! - Calm down, my darling. Stay calm. It will not that bad. - No, no, no. Yes, please? Thank you, Sister Marie. And you say that your wife is a libidinous broad who lost all sense for shame and morals? And she does not even scare away from adultery? And you fear for your children? I always thought I could solve the problem myself. Do not worry, duc d'Alençon. You can be sure of our absolute discretion. No one outside of these walls will ever get to know that the sister of The Empress of Austria is here with us. How long? I cannot tell you that, duc. Only God know. Chastity suggestion. Treatment by coldness. That constricts the blood supply and will calm your/her nerves. Continue. If Your Highness wishes to do so, you can take a walk in the park now. Professor Kraft-Ebing allowed it. That is a appalling story, maman. What did you do after that? I got footsore to find you. But he hid you too well. Furthermore, they were still looking for me. Because they wanted to put me back into the madhouse. You were nowhere to be found. Until last week. Then I heard from a helper at Saint Honoré that he had been introduced to The Duc d'Alençon's daughter. How my did heart beat then. Highness? You? - What...what happened, Freud? Condolences, Highness. Our Duke, your father, has left us. - What? No... No. No... Mummy? Sopherl. But you still have to get dressed so we arrive in time for the court ball in Munich. And you must tell Nadine that she shall dress you in your beautiful dress with the train. And then send me your father. I still have forgotten to say something. I still have... forgotten something. Forgotten... Forgotten something. - I did not want to live anymore. But then... Then I went to Paris to Father Pierre and joined the Dominican Order as a laicistic nun. My mother returned to the world she had always lived for. And probably she herself would have never thought it possible but after the death of your grandfather only the she noticed how much she had loved him. And Edgar? Where was Edgar? Did you ever see him again? No. Never again. Say, where can I reach you if I should die one day? Well father, if you should really die tomorrow you will reach me nowhere anymore. Come here, Edgar. I'm telling you, once I have brought us the new cameras from Paris the people will run over our store like nothing. You can also bring myself something. A cute girl. Yeah I know your taste. Now crank it up nicely. Did you never consider to write him again? - No. But in my next life, I will marry him for sure. I love you, maman. And it is not right if Emmanuel condemns you. Tell him that we from the convent organize a charity bazar tomorrow. There moving photographs will be shown for the first time. They call it movie. I think that could interest him, do you not think so? Oh Louise. Ride carefully. Always. Well how are you doing today? Do not shove. It is enough for everyone. The ladder over here please, yeah? For the curtain. The tables must not be so close to the screen. Yes. - Sophie? May I introduce to you, Auguste and Louis Lumière. We owe the invention of the phenomena called cinematography to them. Sophie! No! Stay calm, Sophie. I'm getting help. I am so happy you are here. Kiss me once again. NO! Love is worth fighting for. Because everything is a fleeting as grass, even humans. They will endure the same as the flower in the steppeland. A hot wind comes. It is already gone. And where it stood no trace of it is left behind. Only if we love, we are immortal. I thank you, Father Pierre.
