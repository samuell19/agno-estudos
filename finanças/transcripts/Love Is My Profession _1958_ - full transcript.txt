LOVE IS MY PROFESSION The cops'll be here tomorrow. - So... - So nothing. It'll take 14,000 to watch the Queen. So we'll be fine. But we still need a gun. Tomorrow. Bring him here. I'll put him there. - Here... - Take him. She closes at 7 pm sharp. Good evening. Ladies... What would you like? It's for a little boy. Very well, how old? - About 12. - Yes, 12. - A book? - He can't read. At 12? Sorry, he has a book already. Soldiers then? I've everything: French, American, British... No Germans? No, I'm expecting them. Jeanne! Thanks... Eugene! Here I am. Say... How about a gun? Really? They're not for kids. Better kids than adults. I do have something. It's pretty good. Like the real thing. How does it work? Hang on... It's great! May I? It's perfect. How much? 340. OK... 100, 200, 264... - You don't have... - 76 F. Here, madam. And a newspaper. Goodbye. Goodbye, ladies. Tomorrow jewelry holdup... - Stop it. - Silly... It won't be news as there'll be no deaths. - What are you looking for? - The horoscope. - So? - Wait... Here. Leo... Business: chance to do good work, to improvise with brio. Avoid anything to cause you enmity. What? Health: beware of chills. Love: don't bother! - And me? Virgo? - Let's go. - Ladies. - Good evening. How can I help? It's my watch. Let's see... Hands up! What's going on? Hold up! No noise! Give us the cash! My, my! Take the watches. But they're not mine. Move it! They're not mine. Get out! - Killers! - Quiet! Can't you see we're armed? Shut up! Somebody help! Shut your trap! Shut it or else! Leave her alone. Let's move! Let's split up! - Where to? - Gaston's. Damn! Under a spring sky, Orly awaits the royal couple as protocol demands. The flags... are fluttering in the breeze to welcome their gracious majesties, who are now on French soil... - Still not seen my girlfriend? - No. Why, what's up? Nothing. It's just... Nothing. Another cognac. That's the third. - I know, I'll pay. - It's not that... You seem off-color. That obvious? A bit. - That's better. - Say... Look who's in. Not tonight. - Gaston. - Now what? - Got a hammer? - What for? - It needs re-heeling. - Give it here. - She should be here. - Who? No?mie, of course. The cort?ge pauses. A girl Princess Anne's age approaches the Queen and gives her a bouquet in France's colors. Her Majesty seems moved and pats her on the head. The cort?ge moves off towards Paris amidst cheers. And then? The cops showed Gaston No?mie's photo. Proves she was arrested. Rather. But she won't talk. She'll give them her stubborn look. Plus Gaston's a friend. He'll say we were both at his bar. You must make sure No?mie knows about the alibi. As a lawyer, you can visit her. Sort it out with Gaston. He's open until 2am. I won't go see this Gaston. Why not? A lawyer can't speak to a witness. - I didn't know. - You don't know much. But you'll take the case? No idea. Because I have no money? What, no money to boot? If money came so easily - I wouldn't have... - Hit the old lady? She's not dead. Luckily. Parents? No, no one. As they sometimes say... "For you... "it's free." Might as well, before they lock me up. Not tempted? So... "No" on all counts? Sit down. Bourdenave! Yes, sir. Make sure the young lady wasn't followed. - By the police? - Yes. No, madam! Not here! Sorry, no parking tonight. Won't be long. We're off to the queen's party. - My husband here? - With a client. Does this Gaston have a police record? Not that I know of. Do you sleep together? A little. And your friend No?mie? Ever been arrested? Yes. What for? Soliciting. And you? Not yet. Hey, be careful. - Of what? - My desk. Try to relax. Sorry. There's a lot of police... For the Queen. Oh, that's right. Thanks, Bourdenave. There are too many just for you. Did the jeweler see both of you? You can't see with an eyepiece in. Can't see? And this? This is noticeable. But lots of girls have long hair. But I... hid it with a scarf. It's not an easy case. We weren't armed. It was a toy. Real or not, it's the same sentence. - How long? - 5 years. That's if the old girl pulls through. She will. It was just a tap. A crowbar's heavy. This case is impossible. Not for you. Even for me. It's ages since I stopped these cases. Plus there's Gaston's perjury. You can trust him, he'll be good. Now go back to your hotel as per normal. When the police come... - and they will as you live with No?mie - you go quietly and don't mention my name. The next day when they ask if you have counsel... tell them, Mr Gobillot. You're great! Thanks! I'll tell No?mie to take you on... You won't. Don't think they'll put you together. They're not that helpful! So what do I do? Do absolutely nothing, my dear. Better that way. Goodbye, see you soon. Sorry. Duret, open a file on Yvette Maudet. Very good, sir. It's just two girls on the game who messed up. They're hungry, see some cheap jewelry and think, "Say... "Steal that, we'll be OK a while." They get a toy gun and mess up. It's a small case. But not easy. Small, hard and doesn't pay. Why take it? Was she pretty? Cheap. But pretty? - That's not it. - Why then? You look ravishing! May I? Here at Versailles, French history reawakes to welcome the Queen fittingly... You were flattered she knew you. - Not at all. - Yes, you were. You're annoying. Just say it amuses me. We'll see. Staying to watch the Queen? If you permit it. I order it. And switch on all the lights. Thank you, sir. Don't thank me, thank the police. They want light for once. Switch off when you go. I'll remember to remember, madam. A few privileged people take their seats to participate in a river cruise in honor of Her Majesty. And here is the Queen in a dazzling evening dress, followed by her Prince Charming, Philip, as relaxed as if this were the Thames on an English Sunday. A candlelit dinner at the UK Embassy awaits the royal couple with dishes fit for a Queen washed down with the finest wines, and champagne to close the soir?e. The boat is now drifting along to an extravaganza of light music and acclaim. The fireworks have begun lighting up the sky with their fiery bouquets and stars of gold... - Yvette Maudet? - Yes, why? - Come along. - I've done nothing. Didn't say you have. Come quietly. Foul weather! - When did you say? - In two weeks, sir. How's your poor wife? Not too good. She's still in hospital. I still have her stockings. Well, my dear, there's no hurry. - Can I help at all? - No thanks. Excuse me. Hello, I'd like to speak to Mr Gobillot. No, it's personal. Mr Gobillot? No, not an appointment. I won't give my name. This is a favor. I don't want any trouble. It's about what happened in the Rue St Gilles. The jeweler's. Bourdenave! Yes, madam. Just one second. There! Quick, take notes! Sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you repeat that? That's it. That changes everything. Everything. That's extremely helpful, madam. If you have anything else don't hesitate to call. That's right. Thank you and goodbye. Wonderful, huh? Now, let's see... Type that and give it to Duret. Come, don't look so serious. Isn't it amusing? Sorry. Come in. Listen, Viviane... News. The jeweler... Which jeweler? The one who's the talk of Paris. In the Rue St Gilles. I received an interesting call. Tell me. Seems this honest craftsman is something of a satyr. Philandering behind his wife's back. I can use that. After all, that night... his wife was out so he took home two little whores. Yes, why not? Trouble is, he identified the two girls. Yes, but with his bad eyes, he could have picked any two girls. He's had lots of them. I'll put ten on the stand. Make sure they resemble Yvette Maudet and her friend. Easy! A brunette and a blonde. And I won't accuse them. "For it is possible that the guilty are among them. "This one, that one, who cares? It's not my business. "You find the guilty. I'm here... "to defend the innocent." Trust me now? I'll paint my two innocents black, too. They could have done it, only they weren't there. They were at Gaston's bar. "Gaston, members of the jury, who has a clean record." Quite indispensable for a perjurer! perjurers never waver. They give the answers I want. Look hard enough at your jeweler, and you might find a little fencing or gold trafficking, huh? See... I mention whores and even you complete the picture. Fencing, trafficking... Good idea, my old girl. - Poor chap. - What do you expect? Defense is no bed of roses. It would be too easy. Disgusting! Move along now! Not only I think so. - Acquitted? - Naturally. I'd have given them the maximum. Not nice to your husband. No, it's not. Come, Duret... Let's go see the great man. Acquitted! That's rich! Call that justice? - Tell us they were in your bar. - I will. - Who hit me then? - And her eye? No idea. The tart you're protecting! I saw her. My word's better than yours. Your word? You crazy old geezer! Move along now! No one'll believe you, you're dishonored. Local people were here. I won't dare show my face. What does it mean? They paid off the barman. That's a very serious accusation. Leave it to me, I haven't finished yet. My compliments. A very simple case. It was hard. I had to make it simple. That's the hard part. See? The gallery was booing. Let them. This isn't the theater. My audience comprises 7 jurors. That's my job. What's this I've been hearing? More glory? You got two whores off? Were they cute? One is. - Which? - Not the other one. When I poison my hubby I'll come to you. Did you hear? What? They booed you. Not me, my witnesses. I had them like that. You had an admirable helper. The loyal Gaston. The barman? Admirable. First-rate witness and liar. One of the girl's lover? Maybe both. Who knows? What difference does it make? They owe him one. No, me. It's not the witness, but what I do that counts. Where is she now, "not the other one"? A hotel on Bvd St Michel. Why St Michel? No idea. It's near the court and near home. Well we live near the court. It wasn't on purpose. I believe you. You don't know you did it on purpose. - Do you know why you took her on? - No, tell me. You wanted to sleep with her. From day one. You did. I knew and rest assured, so did she. Really? Plus, she's your type. It's meaningless to her and to you. As you said it was for you. Yes, as I said. So what can I cook for you tonight? Not going to see her? And "the other one"? Where's she? With family in the country. Where are you going? Where are you going? Tell me where. What is it? Come in. Who is it? - What's the time? - 11.30 It's not late. I don't have a watch, sorry. Give me your coat. It's nice here. I didn't realize, I went straight to bed. Don't you sleep? Come here. You thought about it too much. I never thought about it. - It's just... - Does it worry you? I guess it could be annoying. When you spoke to me on the stand I kept thinking about it. Really? It's the first time in 6 months. I wish it could be with you. "Strictly confidential" of course. "Dear Clerk, "I am shocked to discover "that I have been charged "before the Bar in connection to the Maudet case." That's right. I know you've never liked this case. You should have thrown her out that first time. You wanted to. So it's your fault. Continue... I'll finish this then I'll fetch you. Nothing serious. Where was I? "I know I am accused "of having contacted a principal witness. "The barman, of course. "This is tantamount to saying "I bought his testimony." The barman worries me most. No, he won't talk. Are you so sure? A perjury charge would cost him too dear. And you even more. Who do you take me for? I have Gaston where I want him. I know things about him, that's why he won't talk. OK, OK! Right. OK. OK! Are you driving or me? You are, I'm going out. Where to? I'll drop you off. No thanks. I know where. No, you don't. You got her a place. Already. What's so funny? Him! He's a wonderful trumpeter. At the jazz club. You're not angry? Should I be? I'd no idea you'd come. Neither did I. If you didn't know, how could I? - I'm not blaming you. - Just as well. - Not asking where I've been? - At the jazz club. Yes, but who with? Him. You've no interest in what I do. You do nothing interesting. Not that. You show no interest. You should. It could hurt you. I just take you as you are. How do you know how I am. You don't ask about me. You know, the trumpeter... I didn't sleep with him. I didn't ask. Well, I did. I slept with him... but not today. There's the hook. You're wonderful! What did you drink? Nothing... I swear. Come here. Drugs, huh? How do you know? Damn! Anything but drugs. Or we're through. - It's for you. - What is? For you. But you start screaming. At least let me explain. Here, take it. What's all that? Look. You don't get it. These drugs... I'm selling, not taking. You're crazy! But it earns quite well. - I can pay you back. - What? - Everything. - Do you know what you're doing? Isn't it sweet of me? Maybe, but it's totally stupid! Where are you going? Andr?, what are you doing? That's worth 1 00,000! And 5 years in jail! Now stop all this dealing. Don't pay me back. Take what I give you. Andr?, I'd like to. But if it's like that I must be faithful. I'm not asking you to be. Then I don't get it. I'm not asking that, either. Yet, I'd have liked to pay you back. Not just like this. What's funny? I'm happy. And look... They make holes in the door. You'll check out tomorrow. Miss Maudet, please. She's gone. Where to? Didn't say. - What's your name? - What's it to you? Why? So you're polite now? She left a letter. Mazetti. Not for you. Here... You can have it. It's you! You scared me. - I thought I'd never see you. - Why? 4 days! Didn't you get my note? I could only go this morning. I'm busy. Don't be angry. I know. What are you looking at? What is this place? It's mine. You don't find it charming? You're hard to please. I'll show you around. Look at that. Fancy a bath? You should. I could spend all day in there. And that's not all... I'd fix a drink, but I've only glasses. He doesn't want me to drink. I get it. What? Well, Yvette... You said that your lawyer, Mr... Andr? Gobillot. That your big-hearted lawyer was kindly seeing you right until you found work. - Right. - Wrong. I know work. You're being kept. Because he loves me. Does he? Unimaginably. He lets me do anything. - Except drink. - Tell him about me? No, in fact, I haven't. About the rest, but not you. What, there's more? Before I knew you. It's fantastic. He's back. And he's jealous. Feel like it? I don't. Well, I do. And so do you. Of course. I always want to. Always. Well then? But not here. Not here. Wherever you want. I don't care. Ugly, huh? I've seen worse. Why live so far away? From where? Where you're a doctor. I'm only a student doctor. Yes, but... why live here? It's near the factory. What are you there? Worker. No more? It's just machines... I'm into medicine. And in medicine, what are you? A sophomore. Is that high up? Not really. So you're a good-for-nothing. I think you're wonderful. A student-worker is great. Really? I don't see it. What's good about it? You. You're good about it. Here it is. It's not so bad. I'll tell you, he never even touches me. What do you mean "no"? You're always lying. True, I lie quite a bit. I told you a big one. About my case. It didn't happen like that. You may never want to see me again. Too bad. I have to tell you. You have a criminal before you. I knocked out the old lady. Without him I might have gone to jail. So you see, a man like that is sacred. No reason to sleep with him. Well I never! Hitting an old lady is OK but sleeping with him is not! Really! - You're immoral. - Maybe. It's worse than sleeping with him. Explain. Why kill the old girl? Not kill. Steal watches. You were hungry? Exactly. We shouldn't go hungry. In hunger, you can do what you like. Is that what you think? And afterwards... you mustn't feel ashamed. I said there was no point. It's closed. Come on. This is near enough. I want you to walk by. I'm scared. Exactly. You mustn't be. - Come on. - Let me go! OK, I'll do it for you. No, for yourself. Forget your fear and shame. CLOSED FOR BEREAVEMENT Now do you see? It's sad but it changes nothing. Shut up! You're heartless! No, let me go! Good evening, Duret. Not at all. Of course I'll put him on. Hold the line. I'm sorry, he's not here. What was it? You don't call at midnight for nothing. Not you. Actually... the charge is looking bad. How was the session? Not good, it seems. - That bad? - Very. Well, we'll have to fight. But of course. Yes, it will be amusing. Very amusing. Very. It was the old man that died. The old man! The it's not my fault. I didn't hit him. Everything's all right then! It's rather you who hit him. What you did to him! Could I face a retrial? What's done is done. You're in the clear. Great. I'm the one with the problem, if you care to think. Problem? What kind? They could bar me 2, 3, 4 years, even for life! No cases, no money, ruined. Ring a bell? What's the time? No idea. Answer. Who can it be? They hung up. Maybe a prank. Unless it's your boyfriend. He'd have spoken as I answered. Anyway, he's not the type to go squealing. No, he's a good man. So good he says it's OK to hit an old lady! He's worker by night, student by day. A student doctor at that! Great, huh? Funny kind of great. You worry I'll mix with crooks. I thought you'd be pleased. I'm supposed to be pleased! No, I mean... You're right. I've messed up again. Well, that's you all over. I see you're upset. Can we change the subject? You said to say everything. Speak of that then. Do you think I'm different to others girls? What do they do? They're like you only less annoying! What number do you want? Answer me! In the name of God, answer! Can you hear me? Well, well! I know who it is. Here I am. That was fast. What's up? Duret called. - Bad news for me? - Pretty bad. They're going to launch an enquiry. They don't hang around. We must fight. I do have friends at the Bar. Here, too, Andre. You still have a friend. I hope so. Can I give you some advice? Not that. Pity, Andre. It's a pity but I won't leave her. You'll pay dearly for her when they judge you. Is that blackmail? Know what we'll do after this? But first we'll go pick up your things. You'll see, it'll be quick. Not tonight, I'm tired. I don't need you, I'll go alone. What will you gain from living with me? After a month you'll regret it. Or I'll regret it. I know myself. I'm not cut out for living with a man. All women are cut out for it. Not me. See, you don't understand me. And he does understand you? Yes, he does. I'm a female. I should do as I like. Did he tell you that? It suits us both. It doesn't suit me! - What are you doing? - Taking your keys. Why? I'll move your gear in 2 trips. Give me my keys. Is that it? You won't come? - So you love him? - I don't know. - I need him. - He's keeping you! It's not for the money. What then? I was in the can. You don't understand that. I don't want to go back. He'll keep me out, whereas you... I don't want you inside. You could end up there. I'm no crook. Otherwise I'd use you and him. You're not a crook. You're worse. Know how it will end? Shut up! You'll end up marrying him! Shame on you! It's what you want. What do you take me for? I've never considered it. He's married. So what? And his wife is somebody. I wouldn't even try. Is that it? You're unworthy? Idiot! Run after him then! I will. Give me my keys. No. I'm keeping them. I need them. My keys! The telephone, please. Over there. And the Masson case? Put off to December 15th. So we can't plead before the 15th. Due to this, I'd like... Good evening. More trouble? Where? On my way. Excuse me, I must leave you. Don't wait. Careful, he'll do anything. I know these guys. They kill for money, not love. Leave it to me. Stay there. Come see. Come on. What is it? Your dresses, my child. Not recognize them? The bastard! There, there... Don't cry. Calm down, calm down. You'll have new dresses. Come, sugar, don't get so worked up. I'm not drunk, you know. I'm sorry, it turned my stomach. You won't tell your wife? Why should I tell her? It's not bad. Looks like Bastille day. You could say that. He sure did a good job. Come... Blow your nose. No more tears. It's not the dresses. I'm scared he'll hurt you. Don't be silly. I'll swear this to you, it's over with him. That's right. You can try. Now what? I'll close up before you leave. What is it? Him? He's got a nerve! Can't you have him arrested? - For what? - For what he did. - You want him inside? - No, not that. Well then. I know you're right, but sometimes he scares me. In that case I'll stay. - You won't go home? - I'm not leaving. That makes me so happy. What about your wife? She doesn't need me. Still on the attack? Attack, defense... Not dead yet. - No one wishes you to be. - But everyone hopes. Yet I'm very alive. Eat, drink and... ...very well, too. And you? Didn't think so. It's me, my child. Did you sleep well? It sounds like I woke you. That's OK then. Were you scared? Did they bring breakfast? I have another case, I won't be there till 5pm. Don't leave the apartment. Is he still there? I don't know. OK, I'll take a look. No, I can't see him. He must've gone. I promise, I won't open the door or answer the phone. Unless it's you. You know what I mean. See you later. - Quick, go, he's coming! - Who cares? No, he knows when you've kissed me. I thought he didn't care. He said I'm all lips. Is it true? Let him know. If he didn't, you'd tell him anyway. True, I would tell him. It seems to amuse you. I think it hurts him. And you? Me? Neither hurts me nor amuses me. You don't really care? No, I do care... It makes me... I don't know. You opened it, of course. Yes, of course. You said I would and I did. You know everything I do. You say you like me different, the way I am... I don't want you both. Keep him for yourself. If he stupidly thinks you'll be a doctor's wife! He knows I won't. I told him. And sleep with him again! How is it worse than before? You're right. But from now you're right alone! Andr?, don't go! - I can't lose you. - You have. Go in. You said I can love two men. Now forbid it. I won't forbid anything. Then we're clear. - I don't want a scene. - I tried to be faithful. In the beginning, at least. But tell the truth. Maybe it excited you. - Maybe, but not now. - Really? I'm so pleased! Stay with me. Like yesterday. Then I watched over you, now I'll be watching you. Don't worry about that, Andr?. You can lock me in! I won't move, I swear. Come... We'll start afresh. I asked you something. Answer me. What's going on? - You want to know? - Nothing serious? No, nothing serious. For reasons that will take too long to explain, she can't stay in rented digs. She needs her own place as soon as possible. Sheltered. From what? From someone who's annoying her. I see. What will you do? - Find her an apartment. - What now? Yes, get her an apartment. Sure... Buy it for her? You won't put it in her name? I asked you a question, I want an answer. Answer me. You won't do that? Not now. Let me get changed. No, right now! OK, look... I'm living a day at a time. I don't know how long for. This apartment may be a farewell gift. No promises, though. This is just how I see things now. That's the way it is. Now, consider this... If you disagree, it's war. I don't want it, but if you do, we both stand to lose a lot. Me, more than you. I don't mind losing everything. I know... But I do. OK, then... I accept. Just one thing, Andr?. What? The apartment... Don't put it in her name. If it's your farewell gift, I'll willingly give it, too. Agreed? Agreed. Poor Andr?. Don't pity me. I don't pity you. I'm saving all my pity for me. - Yvette? - She left. - Where? - Didn't say. Look at all this! Brand new dresses! You see queer things with queer people. She left no word for me? - My name's Mazetti. - Nothing for nobody. Are you coming? Stay! Who is it? Yvette Maudet? That's me. I'm the maid. Come in, quick. Well protected! I can't open to everyone. To no one, in fact. He picked a pretty one. Well, I told him to. - How old are you? - 23. I'm 22. A good match. I'll show you round. I like your hairstyle. - Really? - Yes, it suits you. Thanks, miss. My friends don't like it. Well, I do. - Nice, huh? - It sure is. - Original stuff. - I can see. And it's practical. Two big rooms like this, our room and yours. I'm not upstairs? Of course not, I'd be bored. - There's the Viscount... - Him? He's Viscount as the Count sold him to us. - What's your name? - Janine. Come, say hello to Janine. I met a man walking three. That's the Count. He sells everything. He sold the apartment with the paintings. Look at this one. His great-grandfather or earlier. And this basset is a nephew of the Queen of England's. Well, I never. He goes in the garden as I can't go out. I'll tell you as we're living together. Someone's after me. That's why I never go out. Now I understand. Come, I'll show you your room. It was meant for friends. Now it's for you. I have no friends. You're also allowed portraits! It was a big family. - Well furnished, huh? - It's beautiful. You have a large wardrobe. With hangers. And if you enjoy writing, a sweet little desk. Anyway, do as you please. This is so cute! I made it. - Very pretty. - You think so? And well made. I do it on Sundays, my day off. Careful. - It suits me. - It does! How amusing! It's me! One moment. Whom does sir wish to see? Mr Gobillot. On which matter? - It's private. - Come in. I'll lock the door. He's a stickler for it. - That bad? - Yes, indeed. Your coat... Thank you. Go ahead, please. Your briefcase. If I may... I apologize for the wait. Mr Gobillot won't be long. May I offer you a drink? Why not? What's good? Nothing. There's only port. - He has poor taste. - I'd say good taste! I love port. Sit down! One moment, sir. I'll fetch your drink. Do you like it here? I believe so. Miss seems very nice. She is rather! And mister? It's hard to say... You haven't met him yet. But you won't find him mean. - Will you join me? - Not on duty. And really, I don't like port. How do you like the maid? Do you not desire the maid? My word, not at all. And how about the lady of the house? I like the lady of the house. You like her? You don't waste any time! Here, I adore you! I adore him. I made enough for three. Shall I ask her to join us? If you like. Are you thirsty? No, not very. That doesn't matter. Isn't it a bit bright? Viscount! Viscount! Found him! Here you are. Bad boy. Go in, you'll catch cold. Here he is. He fought. He's stronger than he looks. And all dirty! To bed with you, dirty mutt. Happy? It's wonderful. Like being in the country. But you hate the country. When in Paris, I love it. Are you happy? Shall we say it? That we're happy? Sure. I mean to everyone. Out loud. At this hour? Yes, any hour. Shout it out. What will people think? That we're happy. Too bad, I'm doing it. We are happy! You, too. Do it with me. We are happy! Come in, you're cold. You're shivering. It's not the cold. What is it, my sweet? Why the tears? What would I do if I lost you? What a thought. What would you do? I don't know. What would I do? You tell me. You'd put on a brave face like always. That's true. And then what? You'd shed a few tears and then... Then what? You'd want to drown yourself. Would I? You'd want to, but you wouldn't. It would be an act to keep me. That's right. I really don't want to lose you. That's what bothers me. It bothers you to be with me? I say it all the time. He'll think it's self-interest. That's not what I think at all. What is it then? Sometimes even I think so. Well, you're wrong. It's because with me you live correctly. That's all. Correctly? Janine... Even that was to keep me. Guess so. It wasn't worth the trouble. Really? You'd stay just for me? Why not? I'm happy. Blow your nose. A big blow. You know she had a baby. Who? Janine! At 1 9. Now she's 23. It was at a nursery in the country. They took such bad care, it died. My mother put me in a country nursery. Didn't your mother love you? Not a lot. Mine, neither... Good morning, sir. Say it more cheerfully than that. Not your usual self lately. Hope it's not due to my trouble. That's good, because I'm not all trouble. - I'm sure you're not. - Sure you are! But rest assured, if I'm barred for 2 years, - I'll keep you with me. - Thank you. Don't bother. You're the one woman I can't leave. See, you can laugh. And it suits you. See you later. By the way, - Is bike-man back? - Same place. - He's stubborn. - But stupid. You'll lose him. But I'm fed up playing cops and robbers. Good day. Don't speak too loud. - What's up? - She's still asleep. She wasn't well last night. What's wrong? I don't know. She didn't eat breakfast. She went right back to bed. I won't wake her. Has she a fever? - It's not that. - What then? I may as well tell you now. She's scared. Of what? She thinks she's pregnant. Pregnant? She didn't know how you'd take it. How silly! Hello. Is it true? What? What Janine just told me. She told you? I didn't want her to. You're angry. - On the contrary. - Really? Of course. That may be on the spur of the moment. But if you prefer... I won't keep it. Are you mad? Tell me, have you done it before? Twice. You won't have to look after it. I complicate things enough. None of that talk. Are you sure? Well, yes. It's been 1 0 days. Il this morning. And it can only be yours. Will you really be happy? Of course I will. In a few days I'll see a doctor for a test. Why not now? You're in a hurry. Tell me how you feel about it. It's quite a shock, you know. - A good one? - Of course! It's funny how easy it seems. Easy? I mean, so simple, so natural. It's wonderful. Do you want a boy or a girl? I don't mind. I want a girl. If you like. So she'll be better than me. Don't talk silly! I told you not to move. Janine, he wants it. I'm glad you told him. If you'd seen his face! What are you doing today? Sitting down. Awaiting the birth. Looks like it might snow. How would you like to see mountain snow? Mountains mean sanatoriums. No, silly. They mean winter sports. Winter sports! Hear that, Janine? We're going skiing! It's incredible! Miss Bourdenave? Sir is expecting you. This way. Come through, Bourdenave! Now you're here, let's start. Put that down, get comfy and give me the mail. Port? Thank you. Let's see... Dictation: "Metal Corporation. "Dear Director, "I have received a letter from our opponents. "I will need... "To reply, I will need..." Sort that out. "...the minutes of your last board meeting. "It is essential "that you inform me as soon as possible "of Mr Laourcade's position. "It is an important point..." Poor Bourdenave. I did what I could. Now, where were we? "It is an important point." "It is an important point." "Please have your department look into it..." No. "Have your department study it carefully..." Mealtime! I'm not hungry. You must eat. What is it? Oh, no! Not meat! No fuss, now. Eat, obey and be good. And be careful. Come on. Come on. Oh yes, "I also point out "that in note 4a, "which I sent on..." How many? 6 dozen beauties. I'll take the lot. We don't often see you. Always so busy? Working on a good case? You can say that. Client confidentiality. - How much are they? - 1 5,000. - Here. Will you deliver? - Right away. - Will you leave a card? - I won't bother. Miss Yvette Maudet... Address? 4 7 Quai Bourbon. Funny, that's his address. But it's a different name. Maybe they're for the maid. - Get off my back! - What do you want? You've followed me for a week! - When will it end? - When I find her. You won't. I've nothing better to do. She won't see you. You got her letter? A lovely one, dictated by you. She wrote and signed it. She's a big girl now. Trash! She's no letter-writer! She'll have to tell me that to my face. - Where is she? - No idea. Of course, you're scared. Of what? Despite your money, you're not sure of her. She's impulsive. And loves sex. With me, like it or not. With that mug? Right. I'd like another mug but I do it with this one. I'm not ashamed. Now beat it and listen... If you find her, you won't keep her. We'll see about that! Beautiful, aren't they? Magnificent. Was there no card? No, ma'am, just an envelope. - Where is it? - I threw it away. No, leave it. How's it look? Magnificent. I'll keep it on. Just take off the tickets. - You're wearing it out? - Yes, to get used to it. Give that to the lady. Do you ski? I did, a while back. With your wife? A good skier, of course? I'm sure I'll keep falling over. But you won't ski. You won't stop me dancing? I won't stop you dancing. We must buy a gift for Janine. But she's not coming. Exactly. Buy her the same outfit. We're the same size. At Christmas, I like to buy gifts for everyone. Miss, I'd like another apr?s-ski outfit, please. Wrap it separately. This is for you. Thank you, sir. Over here, please. What are you looking at? Nothing. Us three. What's so funny? I didn't say it was funny. Scooters are fun. Shall we go see the toys? No, we won't go see the toys. Well, let us go then. You want to be admired. Maybe. OK, kids, work well, I'm off to have fun. - So, to the toys? - No back upstairs. - Why? - To buy a gift. For who? Come in. I brought you the same sweater. What? I brought you the same one. So we'll be the same. You'll cope. I'll leave you that. These roses, too. Do you want them? Why not? They're innocent roses. So am I. See, you're made for each other. Goodnight, Bourdenave. Goodnight, sir. You're here? I'm not. Fine... Neither am I. War is declared, Bourdenave. Better that than simple hatred. It will occupy her while I'm away. Don't look like that, there's no harm in it. No, it's the best way of helping her. It's like a mercy killing. Love is exactly the same. Put them out of their misery. That's right. You do what you can. It's better to give them real reasons to hate you. Do you like me, Bourdenave? Well, stop crying. I'm a happy man. Happy, Bourdenave... Despite it all. Maybe because of it. You can't explain happiness. Not unless you experience it. Come... Blow your nose. You, too. Is that you? It's you, Janine? Isn't she sleeping? What do you mean? Where is she? Not home for dinner? Why didn't you call? I'm on my way. Go home, I don't need you anymore. What is it, Bourdenave? No idea, madam. Nothing serious? I hope not. Well, I hope it is. It's you, sir. Still no sign? - When did she go out? - She didn't. It was after you left us. And she hasn't been home since? Well, it's not on! When did you get back? And why did you leave her? Listen, sir... She told me to come home. She had an errand. An errand? Do you know Mazetti? You know him! Liar! She never talked about him? I swear. Nor the Quai de Javel? No, why there? And the name of his hotel? I don't know, sir. That's where she is, dimwit! I know nothing, sir. Nothing! I'm scared, too. Where are you going? To the police. In case she's had an accident. If she hasn't, then she's left. Vaugirard? What's happening down there? I'll send an ambulance. It's not for you. Can you describe Yvette Maudet? 22. Beaver fur coat. Skiwear underneath. Sounds funny. La Motte Piquet? Is that you, Colombani? I'll send a busload. Not for you. A fight at a street party. Thank you, but I can't wait here. If you get any news, you can reach me on this number. All night? Yes, all night. Gentlemen... Goodnight. Mr Gobillot! I'll come down. She's been killed. She was stabbed. Quai de Javel. Hotel... du Midi. Hotel du Midi? Thanks. They could at least shut the window! I'll tell 'em. Stop that noise! They're a pain. It's hardly a time for music. Is that stretcher coming? We're going. Hurry up! I'll get it. Send up the stretcher. - Move! - It's for the "package". Let us through. Move along. Nothing to see. Home to bed. Where are you going? I thought as much! Let him in. It's the girl you defended, isn't it? He made no mistake. A worker from the factory. Name of Mazetti. It's awful. A beautiful girl like that. She didn't want to stay with him. That's the reason he gave. He said, "When she went to leave, "I stopped her." "Stopped." Look, they're the same. That stretcher'll be trouble. - What do we do? - Stick her! Right! Can I go? Translation: Mark Bryant
