RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Don't pick up, don't pick up. Why does it have to be so hard? Hello baby sister. How old do we have to be before you're gonna stop calling me that? We'll be wrinkled and toothless and then, maybe. Okay. Can I take this? Yeah thanks. I saw your face on the side of a bus again the other day. Even after four bestsellers it never gets old. How was your drive? It's been a while since you made it. Beautiful as always. Lights from all the farm houses. I wish you'd tell me why you stayed away for so long. We really missed you at Christmastime at home all these years. You know how it is. Work gets in the way. Anyway, I was practically just here. 24 hours from moms funeral doesn't count. It was just too hard, that's all. I want you to enjoy your time at Oliver's Well. Hey, no working over the holiday. I promise. But I do have to head home the day after Christmas. No! I thought you had more time? Well that was before the promotion. You are looking at Emma Reynolds, Huntley and Morrison's newest Junior Partner. Congratulations. That's wonderful. Oh dad would be so... They would both be so proud. Whatever the reasons, I'm glad you came home this Christmas. Andie, if I'd had any idea last year that both mom and dad would be gone... I know, I know. Hey, no regrets alright? They only spoil our present. Thereby multiplying themselves 10 fold. That's pretty good, you should write that. I did. In my last book, Mindful Passion. Mindfulness For The Busy Creative. Mrs. Jacobs still has her old popup store. Yup. Every year. Keeping the old traditions that she started with Bobby. Why don't you go take a look? I'll get us some hot chocolate okay? - That sounds delicious. - Meet back here in 10? Okay. Alright. Emma Reynolds. Hello! Good morning. You might wanna consider one of our blue ribbon wreaths. They're a town favorite. They were first made by one of our most beloved residents. Caroline Reynolds. I think it was the first item we sold in this shop actually. Yeah, blue's not really a Christmas color. Not a Christmas color? No. Not like red, or green, or gold. They are beautiful, unique. Yes, but not traditional. They've been a tradition in my family for 40 years. Am I bothering you? Have we met? Did I steal your parking spot? I think you'd remember me. Mrs. Jacobs, I will take this one. Wonderful dear. It's so nice to see you. You too. When your brother told me you were finally coming home I about danced in cheer. That house deserves a big proper Christmas. Well, it'll be our last one there, so we're gonna make it count. Well you make sure to savor every moment. I will. I miss her so much you know. How much do I owe you? Nothing. It's an early Christmas present. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas sweetheart. Bye. What are all these cars doing here? Did you know we were having people over? No. Andie. Daniel. Emma. Why are you sneaking through the kitchen? You didn't tell me there was gonna be a party here tonight. I must have. I'm sure I did. I'm sure you didn't. Rumi! Hi mom! Oh I missed you so much. Rumi! Hi. Oh you look so beautiful. Oh thank you. Your uncle was just trying to convince us he told us about this little shindig here. Well I mean, grandma and grandpa did have it every year at the same time. So it's not exactly new. It doesn't matter. The point is we are all here together. Hey where's Ian? Oh he's coming for Christmas Eve isn't he? You're looking a little relaxed. Relaxed? Come on, throw on a Christmas sweater or something. All dad's clients are here. Last Reynolds Christmas party in Honeysuckle house. He wanted us to make it a good one. There we go Emmy! It's been waiting for you all year! I wish I could make Christmas forever. Us too sweetie. Well at least we know it will come no matter what. Auntie Emma! Hi Sophie! Welcome back Emma. Thank you Emory! Marco, is that even you? You are so tall I barely recognized you. Sophie, what did we do? Color coordinate here? Here we go. Come on. Everyone, can I have your attention. Boring speech, we'll need fortification. On behalf of my and my sisters, I want to thank you all for coming. We really are touched that you joined us in celebrating what was mom and dads favorite time of year. Mom and dad married on Christmas day. They passed out candy canes as party favors and served a full Christmas dinner. It was a town event. It was love at first sight. But they turned a world wind romance into a 53 year marriage. Our parents instilled us, my sisters and me, a love of family, of celebration. Andie, Emma, they were so proud of you. And so, I ask you all to raise a glass for a toast. Yes. To mom and dad. To mom and dad. To Cliff and Carol. Goodness, I hope Emma doesn't find her secret present this year. But she's so smart, she'll probably look under my desk. Emma! You are ever so clever. Would you like some chocolate mommy? Apologies for the intrusion. That's all right. How are you Mrs. Bernadette? I'm sorry to hear you're selling the house. Oh, well, we are too but it's not really fair to ask Daniel to keep looking after it all by himself. Andie's got her house and I'm... A New Yorker. Daniel's catering my Christmas Ball Fundraiser for the Historical Society. Did he tell you? Yes he did. It's a great choice. He inherited my moms talent for cooking and dads business sense. He won't tell me what you're doing with Carol's Victorian desk. Well that's because we haven't decided yet. It should go to the Historical Society. We can offer you a healthy tax receipt. Thank you for that. I will discuss it with Andie and Dan. Excuse me, my goddaughter owes me a bear of a hug! Joe! Hello sweet pea. Can I have a word with you? Yes! Okay. Excuse us. Cliff left the firm in good shape. Yeah? We didn't lose a single client. That must keep you on your toes. Keep me at my desk more like. Thinking of hiring someone soon. Now we do everything now you know. From parking tickets to land titles. Dad knew every single name didn't he? Gosh, I can't remember the last time my clients were actual people. So tell me about life as a Junior Partner. News travels fast. Andie mentioned it. I guess that means you're happy at Huntley and Morrison? I never expected to make partner so quickly. It's an incredible opportunity. I'm throwing my usual New Year's party. You'll be there right? I leave the day after Christmas. That'll be it huh? I'll come back and visit Oliver's Well from time to time. If you say so. Now I think some gingerbread with my name on it. Look what I just found. Moms old cookie tins. Man she stashed stuff everywhere. She always knew exactly where to find stuff. How lucky are we to have had mom and dad as examples? You know Daniel, you're gonna need to talk to Ian about what's taking him so long to put a ring on our awesome sisters finger. He's way too busy right now getting ready for Mary Bernadette's Christmas Ball. Which by the way, congratulations on that gig. Thanks. It's big. Could really open doors for us. Rumi's been a lifesaver by the way. Serving and helping Anne Marie. She decide whether she's switching majors? Switching majors? She was thinking about dropping the fine arts and doing something else. But Rumi loves her program. When'd she last tell you that? Oh boy. I don't pry Daniel. Sure, you know her best. Hey, you guys. At her birthday dinner though, she said she needed to change. Well I would of liked to be there. You know I was just... I broke up with Ian. What? Was that one of your jokes to break the tension or? No. I mean yes. No. So he's not coming for Christmas. You've been together forever. Mom and dad loved Ian. So did I, but it just wasn't working. So sorry sweetie. There's no better time to start over than Christmas. True. We all know mom and dad would not want us to be sad during Christmas. Agreed. So, I'm determined we stay true to our Reynold's family traditions. The Snowman Festival is a first, and the town tree lighting, then we will be decorating our tree on the weekend. And Mary Bernadette's Christmas Ball is on Christmas Eve. And somewhere in there we eat and sleep right? We will all participate. I need you two to handle getting the house and the contents appraised. Anne Marie and I have prep to do for the ball. It has to go perfectly. Daniel we got this. Just leave it to us. We have to make this last Christmas on Honeysuckle Lane perfect. How was I supposed to know the old Antique Emporium had shut down? What? You don't go antiquing every other weekend like mom did? I missed that gene. Anyway, if there's anyone who will know an alternative, it's Maureen. She bought this place two years ago. It's amazing how much everything changes and yet everything stays exactly the same. Hey, merry almost Christmas. Hi. Hey Emma, you probably don't remember me, Maureen Cutter. My family left halfway through high school. Oh yes, of course I remember you Maureen. Your dad came in every Saturday to read his paper and he always left a tip with a note on the receipt. The sweetest. This is where he brought mom on their first date when it wasn't Crumpets. No way! I had no idea. Do you happen to know someone who could help us appraise our parents estate? I can think of someone alright. The best man for the job is Morgan Shelby. He's a former history professor. Harvard. Now he owns Memory Lane Antiques. - Sounds good. - Thanks. Well, do you want me to go scope that out and see if it's something? Okay. Hello again. It's you. I don't think we've been properly introduced. Morgan Shelby. I think I must be in the wrong place. Oh no, we're the only antique shop in town. You're Cliff and Carol's daughter. Emma the New Yorker. My secret identity has been unmasked. - Mrs. Jacobs. - I can't reveal my sources. Well, I'm looking to have my parents estate appraised. Art and antiques. I can do a walkthrough for you. Let you know if anything's worth more than sentimental value. Not that sentimental items aren't worth anything. Just, I find most peoples expectations are too high. Are we talking about antiques still or just life in general? Thank you for your time Mr. Shelby. I'll go over it with my brother and sister. Going through a loved ones estate can be difficult at any time. At Christmas, must be very very hard. And I'm sorry. When are you free? The taste is very good. Maybe even exceptional. Except in wreaths obviously. Oh I'll forgive her that as long as I don't see any Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeers or angels in hot pink. Well I only wear hot pink Christmas day. This guy used to have a partner. What happened? I broke it last time I was home for Christmas and I haven't found a replacement. A lot of Christmases here. A lot of memories. Well thankfully those don't go away. You know, I usually advise people to choose something special. And make it represent everything they have to let go of. Thank you, that's really good advice professor. Please don't call me professor. Dr. Shelby's fine. When I was a little kid, my mom used to hide all these little gifts around the house in December. Like a scavenger advent hunt. Exactly. Her favorite place to hide things is in her desk. Or under it. This is special. But only of sentimental value I'm sure. No. I admit it, I stand corrected. This... Did your mother ever show you the hidden compartments? What hidden compartments? I had no idea! They're letters written to my mom. "Dearest Caroline, I miss you more than you can imagine. "But my heart is buoyed with thoughts of our engagement." Your father was quite the wordsmith. This is from before my parents met. Signed RJ. These aren't from my father. My mother was engaged to someone else. Well the earliest is from January 1964. And the last one? June 1965. - When was it your parents met? - June 1965. Well that's not strange. I mean most people have multiple relationships. I know, but we always thought my father was my mothers first love. Their story's kind of famous in Oliver's Well. They married in this very house on Christmas day, six months after they met. My mother was on a bus on her way to Richmond. My father sat in the seat across from her. She looked up, caught his eye, and they noticed each other staring at each other. Then he knew. Yeah. Apparently my mother knew even though she was engaged to someone else at the time. And I'm assuming you have no idea who this RJ is? Not a clue. Okay. Hello hello! Anybody home? That's my brother. He cannot know anything about this. - Why? - Because it would crush him. He puts my parents marriage on a pedestal. So you're gonna keep it a secret from him even though you're angry at your mother for keeping a secret from you? Please don't judge me. If my brother found out it would ruin his perfect Christmas. I will tell him about RJ, I just wanna find out who he is first. If that's what you want he won't hear it from me. Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. Hey. Morgan Shelby, antiques. If I may, absolute beautiful home you have here. Emma, you feel free to call me if you decide you need my help. I will show myself out. Oh don't be silly, I'll walk you out. RJ Dublin. You were a writer born in Oliver's Well, Virginia. That narrows it down. Hello? Hello? Anybody in? Hey Joe! Hi Joe. Daniel mentioned you were all going to the Snowman Festival. I thought I'd come give you a lift. He thought I was gonna forget, didn't he? I can neither confirm nor deny. I actually have a question to ask you. - Well that makes two of us. - Really? Now I'm intrigued. Emma, the truth is, I've decided it's time to let someone else take over the firm. Well, I can't say that's entirely unexpected. I know dad wouldn't of wanted you to wreck your health keeping it afloat. And, I think he would have wanted me to pass the torch. To you. - Joe... - You know the town, the people. It's important Emma, they can trust you. Your parents were so much a part of the fabric of Oliver's Well. I have a job. I was just given the opportunity of a lifetime. Well you say it's an opportunity, but is it the one that makes you happy? I'm not unhappy. I'm nervous. It's a whole lot of change. But I left Oliver's Well for a reason. I made my decision a long time ago. I can't just uproot my life. Life goes with you Emma. You're so much like your mother. So sure of yourself. Really? I thought I was more like my dad. No, you're her. More than you know. Now what were you going to ask? I was just gonna ask, do you have any recommendations for a good real estate agent? Darling have you seen these? The ones you make are just as pretty. You could probably earn just as much starting a jewelry business as you do working for Uncle Daniel. Why are you so worried about me making money? I'm barely 20-years-old, can't I just enjoy college? You're enjoying your classes then? Yeah, they're all good. You can talk to me you know. About anything, anything at all. It's been a slow few weeks mom. Not really much to write home about. I should go. I have to meet the choir for rehearsal. We have two teams. Myself and the kids and... Emma and Ian. No, no, no... Oh lovely, I haven't met your gentleman Emma. No, I'm actually not participating. But you're on the list. Daniel, you signed us up? Yeah, it was too late to cancel. Hold on one minute if you will. I'll be right back. Excuse me sir. What's this? Well Emma's snowman making partner is absent so you'll have to do. No. I'm more of an observer, not so much a doer. I tend to avoid things that involve snow and people. Well, too bad Mr. Shelby. Today is the day that you are going to live a little. Here's your partner Emma. Oh no, no, no, no. If I'm gonna have a partner, it can't be somebody with zero snowman making ability. I didn't say I have zero snowman making ability. You didn't have to. I could tell that about you. It's something of a gift I have actually. Ms. Reynolds, we're going to make the greatest snowman of all time. I certainly hope so 'cause I'm in it to win it. Absolutely. We don't do things by half. However, small thing. No gloves. Game face on. My brother got me into this and now I'm gonna make him pay. You're really scary. I mean cute, but scary. Alright, snowman makers, ready! Go! There's only one stick. It's okay. Well this is a very nice snowman. One more minute! So hang on. You've actually never done any of these town events? Nope. Snowman Festival, tree lighting? No way. Christmas Ball? Tell me you've been to the Christmas Ball. You're coming right? No. I prefer to observe at a distance. You mean hide in the background. Okay everybody! Times up! Stop making your snowman! I think we might actually win this thing. I thought you said you had no snowman making abilities? I think we've unleashed a hidden talent. Why do you sound sad? A cowboy here. Look how hard Sophie and Marco worked on theirs. Sophie and Marco? I worked for 20 minutes on Ernest's chin. It's a masterpiece! And how about you? Look at this. A little baby snowman with a top hat. Whoops. Dear. He seems to have met with something of an accident. No head means disqualification. It was very clumsy of me. Probably the gloves. Well I'm so sorry. Thank you. Now can I take these off and buy you some hot chocolate? Yeah. Okay. Every year the kids make these wooden ornaments and write a wish on the back before they hang them on the tree. What'd you wish for as a kid? I don't remember. Probably puppies. Plural. It all seemed so easy then. Now I don't even know what I'd write. So no Christmas wish for this year? Clarity. I don't think that comes in a box. My Christmas Ball is the most important fundraiser. So speaking of chickening out, what were you saying about hiding in the background again? It's Mary Bernadette. Did you forget to get her a Christmas card? No, she keeps asking me about my moms Victorian desk, she really wants it. I just don't feel like talking to her right now. That's why I live in New York. Small towns you're always running into people. I should probably go. What about that hot chocolate? No, I have to meet someone about one of their market finds. I forgot. So how about coffee tomorrow? I can come by the house, maybe take some pictures? Okay, yeah. Okay, alright. Excuse me. Hello. There you are. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, Morgan Shelby. He's cute. Well, he might be cute, but he's terrible at building snowman. Still calling. Even worse, I keep finding myself wanting to answer. You might need to. For closure. Did you know? I didn't know she had the song. I so wish mom and dad were here to see this. Psst. Wake up! Oh my goodness! I've been invaded by tiny elves! Good morning. We're gonna put up the Christmas tree Auntie Emma! That's right we are. Three days until Christmas! Race ya! Three days until Christmas. You're already here. I thought I'd get an early start. Your sister let me in. You already have that coffee? Emma. Anne Marie made eggnog muffins. I'm in heaven. I can't find it anywhere. Find what? The key to the attic storage room. I can't get the tree down... The key that dad kept by the back door. It's not there. I've looked all over for it. I don't know what he's done with it. What he did with it. It's fine. Emma and I can knock down the door. Yeah. I can take a look at it. I happen to pick more locks than I can count. My clients are always losing their keys to their antique cabinets, desks, carriage trunks. I break 'em open. This is the good part about being in a small town. There's always someone around to lend a helping hand. Touche. Thank you. You're welcome. This is gonna be quite something when it gets put up. What if I fall? Oh I wouldn't let my Christmas angel fall. I can reach now. Oh here we are. You got it. Yes, it is. So who do you spend Christmas with? Oh it's just me and my mom. Yeah. Before we moved to Oliver's Well Christmas dinner was pretty quiet. Now we have a table of family and friends. That sounds lovely. It is. Mom makes the turkey and mashed potatoes. Friends bring the trimmings and I make the mince pies and plum pudding. You do? Now, are we talking from scratch or store bought canned tin? Bite your tongue. From scratch, my father taught me. Really? Well you are just full of surprises aren't you? Yes I am. Would you lend me a hand with these? Sure? You love this don't ya? Being here, celebrating with your family. Yeah, I really do. I mean I wish my parents were here but I feel like they still are. If you don't mind me asking, why'd you stay away for so long? I mean you said you hadn't been back for Christmas since law school. Yeah. It was just life I guess. How come you moved to Oliver's Well? My grandparents lived here for 30 years. Yeah, my dad moved us around a lot as kids, but we always came here for Christmas. It was the one constant in my life. When I was younger, I... What? When I was younger, I actually thought I was visiting Santa's village. I thought the same thing! Yeah? Yeah, because it was so... Magical. Yeah. So jump a bunch of years forward, I decide to take a break from academia and start my own business. I thought, why not have the magic every day? Funny thing is, I think for me, my mom and dad were the magic. Ooh, what's this from? The camera! I'd forgotten about this. What is it? Every year at Christmas my family takes a picture in front of the tree. Look, this is from when my mom and dad first got married. Auntie Emma has been here to decorate the tree for forever. I was always thinking about you Sophie. This is it. The last one. Daniel. This year will be no different. Come on family. You want me to? Yes please. Alright. Alright. Three, two, one! Merry Christmas! Let's see. Let's see how it turns out. It's developing. It's gonna take a little while. That is the third time in an hour. Maybe you should just hit accept. Go ahead. Maybe you're right. Excuse me. Gotta be patient. I think it's gonna be a good one. Hey. Hey, you haven't been answering. Yeah I know, I'm sorry. But I needed you to put in this much effort when we actually were together. Well now you're just gonna give up when it gets hard? Or run away to Oliver's Well like you ran away to New York? Sorry, but I can't give up on you that easy. Not Emma Reynolds. Phone calls are easy. That's not enough. And I'm not running away, not this time. Sorry about that. Everything okay? Yeah, recent breakup. We're still sorting through some stuff. It's Morgan isn't it? Yes sir! I come bearing news. Saint Joe. Thank you. It's tough to get a cup of coffee around here. Yeah. It seems you may not need a real estate agent after all. Oh yeah? Is someone interested in buying the house privately? Young couple. Edith and Mason's son and his wife from Pennsylvania, they've got a baby on the way and they decided to move out here. They'd like to come take a look at Honeysuckle. When? Day after tomorrow. You're kidding? Before Christmas? They're staying with family for only a week. The baby is due in February. They want to move fast. I thought you'd be happy with the timeline given your schedule. Yeah. I was expecting to have a little bit more time to figure out what to keep. It's all hitting home now I suppose. Sorry. It's gotta be tough. It's the natural order of things. I'm just surprised it's moving so fast. Half the time I came through the door your mother was sitting at that desk. Reading, writing letters. Joe, since you're here, do you happen to remember an old friend of moms by the name of RJ Dublin? Morgan found a whole bunch of letters from him in the desk. Yeah, he was a writer from Oliver's Well. No, don't recall anyone by that name. If he lived there, Georgina at the library might now who he is. RJ Dublin? Yes of course I know him. RJ Dublin was a pseudonym used by Gaston Waddleburg. A bit of a celebrity really. Because of the scandal. What scandals that? Town paper went wild with the story. His mother took her children in the dead of night and ran away to Ireland. Which was quite a feat in 1915. Wait, 1915? Yes dear. That would make him way too old if he was born before 1915. So, guess we have hit a dead end. That was definitely not the right RJ. What do you mean? I mean, we're gonna have to look somewhere else for answers. Initials are definitely not gonna be enough. Seriously, am I crazy? Why do I care so much about letters from some random man? So he was some ex-fiance. So what right? I think this is about finding out who your mother was. Or who I thought she was. You don't keep letters like this unless they really meant something to you. And you certainly don't keep them a secret. I don't think she even told my dad about this. I think your mother wanted you to find those letters. What makes you think that? I mean you said she used to hide presents for you in the desk drawers. The Christmas scavenger hunt. I think maybe this was one final gift just for you. I don't know. It doesn't feel very much like a gift. It feels like a burden. We don't know how the story ends yet. You know, when I first moved to Oliver's Well, I was seeing someone and I realized pretty quickly she wasn't the one. She knew it too. But letting go was so hard. I think I've kept to myself because... Because it's scary. Caring about someone. Yeah. I think I was waiting for someone to remind me that it was worth it. Oh no! Oh no. They're okay. I think they're okay. You do? Yes. See, no damage. Wait. I don't think I ever saw this postscript before. "PS, the only photograph I have where I do not look dour." There's a photograph. He gave her a photo! That's more than initials! Yeah. Aunt Em. Hey! What are you guys up to? We are looking for grandma's angels. It's not Christmas without those beautiful gold angels. What are you doing? Just looking through some of moms old things. I swear, that woman kept everything. Ooh! Check this out. I love that she kept that. What is it? Wait til you see. Is that grandma's wedding dress? My god, she was so tiny. I know. You know, grandma was studying fine arts. Just like you when she met grandpa. Actually not staying in fine arts. I'm switching to pre-med. When did you decide that? Well I've been taking the science courses as electives and acing all of them, so... That's fantastic Rumi. Congratulations. I'm sorry. I'm so proud. I'm just surprised. Apparently not a good surprise. Rumi, hold on. So much for being able to tell you anything. Andie. Going to medical school isn't exactly the worst form of rebellion. Of course not, it's just... She didn't tell me. She didn't discuss it with me. And now she might be going to med school. She's gonna be across the country. Yeah. You're gonna be alright. You both are. It's just, New York was only a few hours away and you lost touch with mom and dad. You were so close before you left. Rumi doesn't have to move away to know how much she loves it here if she already does. What do you mean? I've been thinking about it lately. I really wish I hadn't stayed away so long. I missed out on a lot. I know that. I should probably go downstairs. I think Morgan's maybe here by now. Yeah, I'm just... You go. I'm gonna stay up here and spend some more time with moms things. - Bye. - Bye. Why are you here Mr. Morgan? Well, I'm helping Aunt Emma with her house. Why? Because I have a special knowledge of old things. Why? Because I think it's important to learn and remember from the past. Like for example, what you're making? I'm making a star to put on top of the tree. Do you guys know what they used to decorate trees with? Did they put paper snowflakes? No. Popcorn! Close, close, warmer. You know what it was? Food. What! Yes! They used to put candy canes, gingerbread shapes, like apples painted with gold. Yum. Delicious right? Hey kids. What exactly have you roped Mr. Shelby into? I found out that the Reynold's Christmases are very hands on. Look, what I found. This was in the attic. In my moms hope chest. This is RJ. Yeah. Do you recognize it. Unfortunately no. I haven't shown 'em to anybody else yet. Anyway. Oh yeah, yeah. I broke the other one of these. We had a fight. My mom and me. It was before I moved to New York. Right after law school. That's the reason why I never came back for Christmas after that. My dad offered me the opportunity to work with him at the Reynolds firm. But I said no. I wanted to move to New York. My mother made me feel like I was breaking my fathers heart. I said some horrible, awful things to her. Our relationship was never the same after that. She just wanted you to come home. I know that now. And I know she regretted it just as much as I did. Neither one of us ever apologized to the other. We were just too stubborn. It was easier I guess to just stay away. I wasted so much time. And now she's gone. Parents and children, they fight. It happens. It's funny, I've never told anybody about that fight. That's okay. Another secret that's safe with me. Thanks. Ian, hi. Hey, how are you? I'm good. I didn't know you were coming. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Hey! - Uncle Ian! Oh merry Christmas! Ian, your Ian? Yeah. No, I mean no. I mean yes, but he's not my Ian anymore. Don't open them okay? - Hey! - Hey! It's a Christmas miracle. He's driven all this way. We broke up. I didn't invite him. Don't look at me, I didn't either. Well I told him I didn't... Oh no. What? I told him I didn't want more phone calls. Well this certainly isn't a phone call. No it's not. Ian Tillman, cardiologist. Morgan Shelby, antiques. So how do you know the family Morgan? I'm helping Emma. You know, with the house. What are you talking about? No, of course it doesn't have anything to do with Morgan Shelby. I only just met him. Morgan loves Oliver's Well. He's not gonna chase you to New York. Clearly Ian's not giving up so easily. Doesn't that say something? A lot of money in antiques? Not in it for the paycheck. Right, right. Emma tells me you two broke up. We're just going through a little rough patch. But I think that her Christmas present might change things. For the better. Ian, were we expecting you? I was hoping it would be a Christmas surprise. So many of those this year. I'll give you guys some space. It was nice to meet you. Emma, why don't I show Ian where the guestroom is. Good idea, thank you. Okay. Alright. Hey Morgan. Wait, you don't have to go. Well, you might have some catching up to do. No, I didn't invite him here. He came after me. I know but he's not giving up. And I can't fault him. Get inside. Before you freeze. Okay. It's good to see you Em. You look good. Chilled. Ian, what are you doing here? Look, if you want me to go, I'll split. But I had to try. Now come on Em. It's practically Christmas Eve. I mean okay, fine Ian. You can stay for one night. Good. Thank you. This is a great house. I always forget how great it is. So my ex-boyfriend is downstairs basically saying he is here to win me back. It's quite romantic. But it doesn't make a lick of difference if you don't love him. I do love him. I did. I don't know. I just wanted a sign, I wanted some clarity. Now I feel more confused. Well I would just like to point out there are zero men after me right now. Zero. Who is this handsome fellow? Mom was gonna leave Oliver's Well? Did you read this? Yeah. Move to Chicago. I had no idea she'd ever even consider something like that. We're not gonna share this with Daniel are we? No. Not at Christmastime. Anyway, I've hit a dead end now. Photo or not. Why wouldn't she tell us about him? Well, Morgan thinks maybe she left the letters in her desk on purpose for me to find. Like... Like your Christmas scavenger hunts. Mom always tried to help us avoid mistakes she made. Maybe RJ was a mistake. Wait, does that mean you think I should go back to Ian? It means you should stop worrying about what other people think. Trust yourself. If it's a mistake, you learn from it. Maybe you should trust Rumi too. Being a mother is ridiculously hard. I wish mom were here. Me too. With all my heart. Alright. Who is hungry? Me! Those look good, right Sophie? Here ya go buddy. The Christmas tree! Me next, me next, me next! Here. I told them I'm usually king of the kitchen, but he insisted. Oh you need a break sometimes man. Plus, these are a bit of a specialty. Thank you. Oh no thanks. Alright family, eat 'em while they're hot. These taste funny. Like play-doh. Kids, don't be rude. They're gluten-free. I think they're delicious. Well, they're your Auntie Emma's favorite. Actually no. I never wanted to hurt your feelings but I prefer pancakes made the old fashion way. Good to know. So what time is that couple coming over to see the house? Around 11. Anne Marie and I have to be at the Bernadette house at noon. And we need Andie to watch the kids. Well, Emma and I can show them around. No problem. Right? Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. You'll notice the excellent detailing here. There's lots of room in this house for a family to grow. The dining room. Yes, the dining room. You alright? A little hard watching a family in the house. Yeah. It is, unexpectedly so. Well it is a beautiful house. And if I was living in the country I couldn't imagine a better place to call home. It's funny, lately I've been wondering what if I did live in the country? No, Oliver's Well was suffocating for you remember? Yeah, it was. I don't know, dreams change. I've been realizing maybe I need to be flexible enough to change with them. Emma. It was my fault. Us breaking up. I got scared. Scared? Of what? Of commitment. Of tradition. Of settling down. I'm not scared anymore though. Now I was gonna wait 'til tomorrow to do this but I've waited long enough already. Ian. Emma Reynolds, will you marry me? You said you always needed commitment and romance, and you're right. I can do that. Ian this is... You don't have to answer now. Think about it. It's a shock, I know, I'm not stupid. But love isn't always as easy as your folks made it seem. Plus, this is always kind of how you imagined it isn't it? Christmastime, mistletoe. I mean yes, it is. Ian! What are you... - What do you mean? - I didn't say yes. It's stuck! The ring is stuck. It won't come off. Emma? Emma? Ian? Yeah? It's practically a blizzard out there. Daniel just called. He's nearly incoherent. Something happened with the servers. We need to get there. - Okay. - Okay. I haven't been here in so long I don't even remember where the kitchen is. Ian, would you take our coats? Yes. Find some place to put them. Yeah, whatever you need. Thank you. Welcome. Thanks. Something happened during that house tour. Thank goodness you're here. Uncle Daniel is losing his mind about the waiters. - What about the waiters? - Just, we just need to go. They're stuck, in Charlotte. All my catering staff are snowed in. Take a breath Daniel. Take a breath? This is the historical societies biggest event of the year. It needs to be flawless. Since when is anything ever flawless? And Anne Marie and the kids are at her parents. They're snowed in too. If we ruin this... It won't be ruined Daniel. What are you doing? Andie and I both waitressed in high school. Rumi, you just need to give me a little refresher course. Don't spill. And don't eat all the food. Okay. No, Mary Bernadette will know. So pretend it was planned. People are gonna love seeing the Reynolds sister serving. Come on Daniel. Isn't this exactly what our parents would have done? When things don't go exactly as planned, that's when the magic happens. Emma, what is that on your finger? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. That's, this is stuck. This is not. Fresh from the oven. Hey, so what happened? He proposed but I didn't say yes. Does Ian know that? Yes, he said I could think about it but then the ring got stuck and then you came in. Sweetie, if you have to think about it, isn't that an answer? Excuse me. You came. You look beautiful. Thank you. You do realize this is a Christmas party right? Dancing, people, socializing. Not really your thing right? Somebody once told me I need to stop hiding in the background and get out of my comfort zone. Morgan. I found him. I found RJ. You're kidding? Where? Here? Yeah. Where? The photo of him. Saint Nicks Christmas Shop. Bobby and Rachel Jacobs. Bobby, Robert. Robert Jacobs. That is one of my favorite photos of us. It was the first Christmas we opened the shop. RJ, RJ was your husband. RJ, I haven't heard that in years. You know, he started going by Bobby after we were married. Rachel and RJ, just sounded too cute for him. So how did you two meet? Your mother introduced us. It's one of the reasons why we kept making those blue ribbon wreaths. She started it all. Mrs. Jacobs, Emma and I found some letters. Love letters from an old fiance we never knew about. Well, it is the true beginning that always gets left out of their famous love story. But, it doesn't seem like now's the time to tell it. Would you like to come over to the house later? I have to leave right after Christmas. I would love that. I have seen 32 Honeysuckle Lane in a long while. But now I think I'm gonna go track down one of those delicious quiche. Okay. I'll see you later. Yes. Well that's not where I thought the evening was going. I've made a pretty big decision. About? Morgan! Hi. - I thought I lost ya. - Never. Emma, do you know Maureen? Of course. Emma you look gorgeous. Oh, well. The apron wasn't really part of the outfit, but we Reynolds never do anything according to plan. Is that? Oh my gosh, that ring is stunning. Congratulations. So, who's the lucky man? Well it just happened. I haven't actually... A Christmas proposal is almost as romantic as a Christmas wedding. Congratulations Emma. I'm very happy for you and Ian. I should probably get back out to Andie and Daniel. They probably think I've run off. Enjoy your evening you two. Christmas miracle. Hey are you hiding back here? Yeah. Ian we need to talk. You made your decision. I'm sorry, I can't marry you. You deserve to be with somebody who is completely, crazy, madly in love with you. Who doesn't have to think twice about whether they want to marry you. And I deserve... Someone who actually knows you. Yeah. I just want you to be happy. Hey, will you stay for Christmas? If not for me, for Daniel. That's nice Em but I think it's best if I leave. I don't regret one second. Not one. Me neither. You alright Em? Alright and better. Guess who I found a photograph of on Mary's wall? What's going on? They met in college. Your mother planned to leave home for good, join Bobby, RJ she called him in Chicago after graduation. I can't even imagine mom living anywhere else. No. Once upon a time she wanted to be a city girl. Then that summer changed everything though. Bobby arrived in Oliver's Well to find Carol in love with the town and with another man. So she left him, broke off the engagement to be with dad? She told Bobby right away, there were no lies. No secrets. And Bobby stayed? Why? The magic of Oliver's Well. He felt at home here. He must've been so angry. Hurt. At first, certainly. But darling, it takes guts to leave someone who is wrong for you. To admit you made a mistake. And in this tale it was the absolute best decision. Mom allowed not just one but two love stories to begin. She gave me the best gift I could ever ask for. I owe her so much. Oh we loved both of them more than words can say. I gotta tuck the kids into bed. Merry Christmas Mrs. Jacobs. Merry Christmas Daniel. Emma. Emma. Emma wake up. It's Christmas. Merry Christmas sweetie. Daniel's up. Okay. We thought we heard something. Taking after dad? Doing a little last minute present wrapping? Couldn't sleep. That was not the Christmas Eve that I had planned. It was a success. You and Anne Marie were a triumph. Yet, in the middle of it, my sister managed to get engaged and unengaged. Then I find out our parents fairytale love story has a serious twist. A secret they kept from me. Us. I don't think it was intentional deception. Memories get foggy. What else don't we know? I have so many questions. Questions I was too busy to ask. There's so much more I want to say. I know. Me too. I hate that we can't talk to them. I can't believe we lost them. We haven't really lost them you know. They are everywhere. They are in every corner of this house. They're in the lives of so many people. In us. Hey. You don't have to hold this family together you know. Not all by yourself. We are all here for each other. I was just trying to make her proud. Keep Christmas the way they would of wanted. I thought it might keep it from hurting so much. Well you did it. You did it. This is exactly the Christmas they would have wanted. Full of surprises. Speaking of surprises, I have one more for you both. I've decided to buy this house. What? Yeah. I'm moving back here. And I'm gonna take over the firm from Joe. Daniel, this is a good thing. I didn't know. I didn't even think you... Emma the Davis' made an offer yesterday morning after they saw the house. And I accepted on our behalf. Okay. Hey it's fine, it's no big deal. That just means it wasn't meant to be, that's all. Oh no. Before breakfast even. Hey, I make my own rules. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas baby sister. I am gonna head back. Oliver's Well will still be here. Morgan Shelby might not be. Morgan thinks of me as a friend. He also thinks you're engaged. You guys better get in there. The kids are gonna mutiny if we don't start opening presents. Hey you two, talk. So, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about med school. And I'm sorry I made you feel like I was too busy to listen. You have everything it takes to be an excellent doctor. You mean that? I do. I just feel like I'm disappointing you. Rumi, do you have any idea how proud I am that even I wasn't even able to sway you? If there's one thing I learned from my mother it's that you have to let your children follow their dreams. And trust that they'll come home to you. Grandma had a hard time with that and now, I am too. Promise me one thing okay. That you will tell me when you're making these big life decisions? So I can just pretend you still need me. I don't have to pretend mom. I do need you. At least... A present here for you Emma. Wait there's no tag. Not from me. Or us. Don't look at me. Okay. It's just like the one mom had. I broke the other one years ago by accident. When I had that fight with mom. "Dear Emma, Merry Christmas." This gentleman journeyed to my shop two years ago. Kept him hidden because I couldn't bear to sell him. I think he'd be better off with you though. I hope he'll bring you joy, because I certainly have found joy in your company this Christmas. It's from Morgan. Emma. What was the moral of our parents love story? To be brave. I have to go. Go where? I left things all wrong with Morgan. But I have a turkey cooking. But I'm leaving tomorrow. It's Christmas Daniel. You know anything is possible at Christmas. Emma hi, Merry Christmas. Hey, Merry Christmas Maureen. I'm so sorry to interrupt. May I have a quick word... I've got it Maureen. Hey. Hi. I take it you got my gift? I did. I can't believe you had him here. Thank you so much. Did you drive all the way out just to say thank you? You didn't have to do that. Well I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning so it's now or never. I heard the house sold. Maureen knows the couple who bought it so I guess it all worked out in the end. I'm glad. I want you to know, this Christmas would have been a lot harder for me without you. That's what friends are for. I don't wanna leave without giving you your gift. Give it a chance. Maybe it'll grow on you. Thank you. Anyway. Emma. Yeah. Don't stay away so long. Next time. Okay. I won't. If you and Maureen end up coming to New York, look me up. Bye. Really? You should of told her there was nothing going on between us. I didn't realize that's what she meant. But what's the point? She's engaged and she's... She wasn't wearing the ring today. You think a woman like Emma Reynolds comes around every Christmas? No. I think it's been years since she's been here and it's gonna be even more years before she comes back to Oliver's Well. She didn't come over here just to say thank you. Now's the part when you run after her and you tell her that you love her. Because you do. I know because you've never bought one before. What are you doing here? I think I owe you a hot chocolate. Emma. Yeah. I need to know. What happened with Ian? Ian left. He went home for Christmas. Without you? I told him no. I couldn't marry him. I realized that my mother was really brave about speaking the truth about how she felt and what was in her heart. And I decided I have to be the same way. So I told him no, we weren't right for each other. But the ring. The ring was stuck. I couldn't get it off. That's terrible. I know, you're telling me. But you should be home with Maureen right now. Maureen's my cousin. You're kidding. No. I should tell you when I was buying tickets for the ball. I was planning on asking you when we were decorating the tree. But then when Ian came, I just thought... Getting to spend part of your Christmas with you has taught me that I've been playing it safe. Sticking to what I know instead of being open to... To taking chances. I've learned that I don't care if I have to drive six hours to see you. I don't care what I have to do as long as I get to see you at the end of it. And I've learned that I never should of let you off my front step and I'm not gonna let you go now. Emma. I am gratefully, happily, and deeply in love with you. I'm in love with you too. Merry Christmas! Hey Joe! Hey, I come bearing tidings of great joy. What is this? A little present from your brother. This is paperwork for the sale of Honeysuckle house. But Daniel... I called the Davis', told them everything, and they released us from the contract. They totally understood the change of heart. The house is yours Emma. Provided your siblings agree. Of course, it's wonderful. What? Oh Joe! Well in that case, is the offer to take over for you still on the table? I thought you'd never ask. I'll write up your resignation letter to Huntley and Morrison myself. Welcome home Emma. Everybody, here's to another wonderful Christmas on Honeysuckle Lane. May there be many more. This one's gonna be pretty hard to top. I'll try my best. I hope you're hungry. Oh yeah, of course. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
