Chocolate, Mommy! Jules! If you're hungry, I can make you a toast. Chocolate! Not now, you're about to have dinner with the nanny. I'm hungry. Chocolate, chocolate! After, darling. Come on Mommy! My saviour! My darling, can you take Jules please? I haven't got the cake in the oven yet. How's my little man? You good? What's that? a bit of chocolate? No. And Mommy won't feed you? 2 minutes, promise. It's because she is a wicked witch! - No! - Yes. She starves all the little children in the forest. It's not chocolate, look. It's dragon poo. And look what's this? It's ant droppings. And lizard paws. And cat fingers. No, cats don't have fingers. Ah that's true. Lizard have fingers. It's true, it's true! They have hands and feet. No. That's for me. That's for you. Ferrand Family, Francois speaking. I'm hungry. It's Carol. Yes, Carol. No, of course. No, it's fine. Okay, bye. She asked me to pick up the wine. You know, there's a magic word in the English language. It's very short, very simple, it's etymology is indo-European: N. O. She needs me to Francois, don't. I'm having a shower. Thanks. ALICE Victor Hugo is a pain in the arse. I'm going to shorten this race, you'll see. You're going to stand up, please. Get up. Can I... ? How much do I get if I win? You'll double it. Do this for us, without thinking, a passage from Racine. A justified fury overcomes my soul. Whereas you go to the altar I run there, Madam. If the sky is famished for blood and souls, never have its altars been so quenched in smoke. To my blind love all shall be legitimate. Excellent, just need Jean Racine. The guy is on fire. Where were we? Too easy. In any case, way to go to get the chicks. I got the blonde, thank you Jean Racine! And your novel, Francois, how is it going? Yeah Francois, your novel, how is it going? Ten years for the first chapter. Rome was not built in a day my friends. I'm so late. Why didn't you wake me? Francois, it's not even 8 a.m! It's to kill the germs. Give us a kiss. Kiss-fart. I'm sorry, I'm just stressed. Yeah me too, sorry. Goodbye my loves. See you tonight. See you tonight Daddy. That will be 57.37 euros please. Thank you. Yes tomorrow I can take care of her. Not sure. When it suits you. Yes, with Jules. The payment was refused. Really? Could you try again? Of course, no problem. Sorry. See you tomorrow. Okay, let's do that. No, it still doesn't work, the payment was refused. Request declined. Please take your card. This is François Ferrand, leave me a message, I'll call you back. Darling, neither of my credit cards are working, call me when you can. Mrs. Ferrand, the director is ready to see you. End of the hallway, on the left. Thank you. He received three extra weeks to make the payment. Sorry? I do not understand how you could not know. Not know what? As of May last year no payments have been made towards your home loan. Mr. Ferrand came in to see me several times each time he pushed dates on payments until it was out of my hands. The foreclosure process has started. Foreclosure! Yes, Mr. Ferrand made an appeal. François knows nothing of this either. There must be some mistake. Mr. Ferrand has been making large cash withdrawals fortnightly since last year. I don't understand. I can see that. But right now you are owing in excess of 77,480 euros. Your apartment is going to be auctioned in less than three weeks. I suggest you look closely at your accounts. I assure you, this is very serious. But this can't be legal. I have not been informed, not at all! Yes. Countless letters, countless phone calls. No, nothing! Listen... I think you need to have a discussion with your husband. Please, show me the accounts. This can't be right. There has to be some sort of mistake. Our life insurance! If we are a little late, I can pay right now with our life insurance! All your accounts have been emptied. You are not a little bit late, you are over one year late! Do you understand? How is it possible? Why wasn't I informed?! Your husband also has power of attorney... I can assure you that he is fully aware of this situation. Incorrect password. This is François Ferrand. Leave a message. François! What are you doing to me? Why won't you call me back? Come home right now! Jules. You have to eat so we can go to bed. That's enough! You're going to bed! Mommy is tired, everyone is tired! This is François Ferrand, leave a message, I'll call you back. Call me back. I'm begging you François, call me back. I completely forgot. I'm really late. Jules! Incorrect password. Kids, I'm making some calls. Hello. Hi, I'm looking for a Francois Ferrand, do you know him? No. Please, I found your number among his things. No, I don't know a Francois, sorry. Well, how is it then that... Hello, can I speak to Sophia please? Elegant Escorts, Jessica speaking. How can I help you? Elegant Escorts, how can I help you? Hello? Elegant Escorts, Jessica speaking. - How can I help you? - Hello. I would like to know how much you charge. I'm sorry, that is not something we can discuss over the phone. What do you mean? How am I supposed to know? If you are looking for work, we're holding interviews this Thursday at 2 p.m. Would you like to make an appointment? No, I just want to know how much. How much do they pay for your services? That information cannot be discussed by phone. You call me back Francois, you come here and tell me what you... What you... What you... Fuck! Hello! Ah Nathalie, sorry. Yes. I forgot. Of course. Can I drop it off tomorrow instead? Yes, first thing in the morning. Bye. This is Francois Ferrand, leave a message, I'll call you back. Still not answering? You're a loser, an asshole. You're an asshole! Over here girls! I'd like to say we have an excellent reputation because we only deal with the creme de la creme. "The cream of the crop". For those who are anglophone it's appreciated. But it's not necessary. We use an advanced screening system to know exactly who we are dealing with. These are millionaires. And billionaires. We have a price range... ... between 600 and 1,800 euros for the hour between 1,500 and 2,500 euros for a dinner date And 4,000 euros - Or more... - For an overnight. We take 30%, which is little compared to other agencies. It is the lowest rate on the market. Yet we deal with the highest class clientele. Hello Darling. Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb. Thank you, Darling. Excuse me, could I ask you something? Of course. It might sound really stupid but... Your name wouldn't be Jade or Sophia by any chance? Sorry! Really, it's so stupid. Hello, would you like something to drink? Thank you but I'm not staying. Are you alright? Yes. Why do you ask that? I don't know. You look freaked out. Is it that obvious? Yes. Well, you are right, I am. - What? - Freaked out. Why? What's so funny? I don't know. You are. Sorry. I don't mean to be rude. I mean, it's just you're very... - Blunt? - Yeah. What were you doing at the interview? I needed information and they refused to talk to me on the phone. You're thinking of joining the Paris circuit then? The Paris circuit? No, certainly not, no! I want answers. And they didn't want to tell me anything on the phone. - I came because I need answers. - About what? I don't know. Costs, how it works... Hello? Yes. 15 minutes? Alright. Great. Okay, thank you. They are going to call you. Who? Vera and Jessica. You and one other girl will be called. - The others will be disappointed. - How do you know? It's that good girl thing you got going. They will call you. You will need better shoes though. What's the problem? You could just say no. Do you want my number? You shouldn't let yourself go so easily. Darling, your application has been successful. How about Sophia for a name? Call me back. If I want to sell so quickly, it's to save my deposit, you understand? I put down 90,000 euros on this apartment. It's my inheritance, it's all I have got. Are you telling me I'll never see my money again? You need to know what you want. To sell it quickly or... Otherwise, you can sell it at the market price but it's going to take more time. I don't have time! It's over! In that case... Mrs. Ferrand, on paper you are every bit as responsible as your husband. Everything I have is in this apartment. It's all I have. He kept the entire thing hidden. I have a child. Please, give me a chance. Mrs. Ferrand, please, calm down. Two weeks. We need 10% of the debt, that is 7,748 euros in order to push foreclosure. This financial pressure will remain as such until payments are completed. If you miss even one payment, there is nothing I can do for you. A sweet song, my mother sang to me. While sucking my thumb, I listened as I fell asleep. A doe in the forest. This doe is like you. And the wolf, we don't care because we have each other. We have each other. Yes, hello? Mom? Alice? Is everything okay? It's so late... How is Dad? The nurse is with him almost full time now. Of course the insurance won't cover even half of it. It's hard. What is it, Alice? Is Jules okay? Yes, Jules is fine. Mom, I need to come home. Why? What's happening? What's going on, Alice? François took all the money Dad gave me. I have to come home, I have no choice. Hang on, what are you talking about, Alice? I have to come home with Jules, Mom. I have no choice. Alice, you don't leave your husband at the first sign of difficulty. What? He left us, Mom. He stole everything! Alice, Francois is a good man, a good father. There has to be an explication. You have to talk to him, Alice! That would be difficult, he's not taking my calls. Well, maybe he just needs some time. I'm sure he just needs some time. He spent all our money... to go and see whores... if you must know everything. Maybe he felt something was missing at home. You didn't just say that to me. Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry... I just mean that marriage is hard work. Your generation thinks it should be easy, well, it's not. Alice, you have a family to think of now. There is nothing more important than your family. Don't give up... I know it's difficult. But I know you can do it. Be strong. Hello Vera, Alice Ferrand speaking. Yes. I got your message. Hello? Yes, it's me. One p.m.? Alright, I'll be there. Thank you. Speak to you later. Are you okay, Alice? I think I need to go home. Hi! Hi. Come in. Do you want some tea or something? Yes. I've never done anything like this before. A useful tip... We can't see it... yet it's there, ready for use. First, you get the money upfront. That's the most important thing. Then, call the agency. You go into the bathroom you come out in some sexy lingerie. You offer him a massage. You never have to work hard, just get right to it. Then he will turn over. See? It's easy. The rest is up to you. If you do your job right, I promise you, it never takes long. You're the boss. Sophia? Please, come in. So... Would you like a something to drink? No thank you, I ... - I'm suppose to call the agency. - Okay. And also... I'm sorry. For? Sorry. Yes, of course. My apologies. - Here you go. - Thank you. Oh my God! I'm sorry. It's alright. - It's me. - No, it's me. Sorry. - Sorry, I feel terrible. - It's alright, it's alright. It's alright! Sorry. I'll call now. Can I? I'm supposed to call from here. Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead. Press 0 for outside calls. Hi Vera, Sophia speaking. Yes, I'm here. Everything is fine. I'm just going... - The bathroom? - Yes. Of course. There it is. Oh, be careful. It's alright. You're so lovely. Sorry? Would you like a massage? Ah okay, that'd be great. A massage. - Sorry. - It's alright. Oh yeah,That's good. Keep going. Oh God, don't stop! Fuck! I'll do it! I'm so sorry. - Really, I'm so sorry. - It's alright, don't worry about it. - I'm really sorry! - I'll take care of it. I'm so sorry. It's alright. Do you want me to... Yeah, lay down. Relax, okay? Do you... What? Sorry. - Everything okay now? - Yes. Okay, don't talk anymore. Stop talking. Stop talking. I think it clenched on him, it was... Did you hurt him? I was awful, I was so bad. Did he come? Did you do it? Yes but it was over in a flash. So you weren't that bad, you did the job. Where's the problem? I was woeful. But he was your first, you were nervous, that's normal. What is it? I don't feel any different. You mean now that you're a fallen woman? If you're in love, having sex may be the best experience of your life. If you are raped, maybe it's the worst. But in our case, things are under our control, the exchange is fair. So why should you feel different? I can't believed he paid 1,200 euros for that! It's amazing, when I do the calculations! Trick is to cut the agency fee. And get regulars who take you away on weekends. Now that's real money! A lot of money! You think too much. You know how to do this. You have been doing it your whole life. You have been trained to scan people's emotions. To know what to say, how to behave, how to please everyone. Take control, Sophia. That's what he wants. Often, they are a bit scared of you. Think of yourself as a nurse. How can you comfort and reassure him? You have nice hands. May I? You take good care of them, don't you? I get manicures monthly. It's nice a man who takes care of his hands. You're having an effect just by being there. You don't have much to do. Would you like a massage? Very much. I always think of the money. Lots and lots and lots of money. You do the usual thing, fake how fabulous he is. The better you are at faking, the quicker it will be over. Usually the sex part is over fast. And you? Attorney, specializing in family law. Mostly bicultural divorces. So, you make money from other people's misery? That's it. -I quit. -How kind of you to inform me. 2,400 euros! You still owe 3,800 euros before the next payment. It's coming! Goodbye. Come on. You want to go see the boats? Papa! You need to go to your room. Where were you? Where were you? At Olivier's place. Right next door? Right next door! Stop Francois, stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop. Alice. Why François? Why? How could you destroy everything and continue to live with us? I'm here. Why did you do that? How? Why? Look at me. How could you destroy everything? How could you be unfaithful like that? How could you destroy everything we built, how could you do that? And you stole everything from me, all my money! That's the only thing my father gave me. I know. No, you don't know. I needed you. I know. I know, I'm sorry my love. I couldn't come before, but I'm here now. I see you and I missed you so much. I'm so sorry I hurt you. No! Stop. Get out. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out... Hello, Vera. Yes. Yes. 45 minutes? Hi, it's Alice. I have an emergency. Can you open? Okay. What is it? Sorry, it's urgent. Can I leave him with you for a few hours? What's going on, Alice? I can't explain right now, I'm so late. - Late for what? - Please, can I leave with you? - Where are you going? - Can I explain when I get back? Where are you going dressed like that? - Two hours that's all! - Yeah right! Please Carol! You're going to wake Oscar, then he won't get back to sleep. - I won't make it if I don't leave now. - You don't crash on people at this hour! He should be in his bed like all the kids his age. Thank you very much, Alice! Thank you, Carol. Shit. Come on! Come on Celine, answer! Damn! What are you doing? God Alice, they'll never call you again. What am I suppose to do? Can't you get a baby-sitter? In 10 minutes? There is no baby-sitter who can be here within 10 minutes. You could lower your prices and work more through the day for more lower end clients. Such as? 350, 500 euros with a bit of luck. No, I'm not going to lower my prices. Okay. Good girl. I only know one other high end agency that's worth it. I'll give you the number. You can call her. Sorry about that. So... It doesn't stop. You ever thought of Dubai? You'd make a killing over there. I have a kid, so I prefer... Oh, you're wrong. You're so wrong. You look good! Thanks. I'll be with you. It's 1,200 an hour, 1,800 for a dinner, 3,000 over night. I take 40%. - Can you take a booking right now? - Yes! Do you speak other languages? I took German at school. Useless. They all speak English. Here. He is expecting you in 45 minutes. Japanese! Japanese, that's really useful. Who's that now? - Good morning. - Are you Mrs. Ferrand? Yes. The warrant for eviction. What? No, I got an extension. That's not my job, this is my job. You will be entitled to 30 days notice of eviction from today. Once the notice period is up, the bailiffs will attend this property. If you have not already vacated, you will be removed and the locks will be changed. This is a mistake. I got an extension. You can call the number- Yes! You can call the number. Good day, Madam. Yes. Sir? Mrs. Ferrand, we don't have an appointment. I need to talk to you now! - I'm afraid I'm busy. See my secretary... - No! Can I call you back? Mrs. Ferrand, this is unacceptable. I had a man nailing an eviction notice on my door this morning. This is a bank, Mrs. Ferrand, not a charity fund. How dare you? I've been making payments! Your last payment was short by 3,500 euros. I will save my home, Mr. Gaubert. Please, I'm not asking for charity. I will have your money soon, I promise. Three days. I swear to God, I will have your money. It's not just the last payment, Mrs. Ferrand. Your next payment is in fifteen days. I can do it. Give me one last chance! Three days, I'm begging you. Three days but it's the very last time. Thank you, you won't regret it! 15,000? 10,000 if that's too much. Okay, I understand. Vera! Yes? It's Jessica, Darling. A client would like a dinner date with you, and only you! 9 p.m. at the Royal. 2,500 for three hours. - I need to know I can rely on you! - Yes! I'll be there! I can't give 48 hours notice, I need a baby-sitter right now! Fuck! - Hi Alice. - What are you doing here? Please Alice, you have every right to hate me but... Papa! Hello you. You want to see Jules, is that it? - Yes. - Okay. Thanks. This is for Jules. I'm going to get ready. You're leaving? Dinner with a girlfriend. Do you want to spend some time with your son or not? Of course. But Alice, we absolutely have to talk. He is lost, that's true. - That's not good! - No, that's not good. - He is lost. - Yes, he is. There's leftovers in the fridge and yogurt for Jules. Okay? Mommy will see you in the morning, okay my love? I am really glad you could make it. It was good timing. He's sleeping. Do you want something to drink? I cleaned the table too. You can go now. Leave. Why Francois? Answer me. Was it worth it to sleep with all those girls, was it worth it? Can we just sit down? Answer me. How did you think you would get away with this? It was a cry for help, Alice. I need help. I need you. - I know I can't take back what I did... - When did it start? Tell me. The first time, I was 13 years old, my father took me to see someone. It was perverted. With me. When did it start with me? No more lies. Tell me the truth. I don't know. It was mostly last year, I lost it. Mostly last year... Meaning even before you were screwing whores and stealing my money. It wasn't like that. Money, flesh, who cares. It meant nothing to me. I needed to escape. Escape? Escape what? Was it a prison here for you? There's a door for Gods sake! You didn't have to steal all my money. The deposit on this house is all I have. It is Jules and my security! Please, Alice, listen to me. I'm listening, Francois, I'm listening. It was this traditional father figure I had to be. My soulless job that sucks away my lust for life. No real sex between us anymore. I was... I was... I was scared. Scared? Scared? What are you talking about? Alice please, I'm trying so hard here. Who is calling you at this hour? You're not going to answer it? We're in the middle of a discussion. Please, Alice. Who was it? I have a new job. I'm a personal assistant for a rich American business woman. She travels constantly, so she's always on a weird time clock. I have to run back and forth at her whim, so it's difficult with Jules. But she pays me well, so I can't afford to say no. Of course. It would help me if you stayed with Jules. What, now? - Right now? - Yes. Okay. I'm not sure when I'm home. If it's late, just sleep on the couch. Mommy! Mommy! I thought it would do you good to sleep in. Eating your breakfast my love? What's left, he's not very hungry today. I want to help. I can be there when you need me. I can take him to school now if you want. How long would it take you to get here? Hypothetically speaking... I'll come right away! Whenever you need. Except Wednesday nights. I'm teaching in Lyon. Other than that, I can be here, okay? You'd better get him dressed then, it's getting late. I have never had so much free time in my life. Let's go on a boat cruise then. I got accepted at the University of Auckland. That's fantastic! It's one of the best. It's what I wanted. When are you leaving? I'm not going to go. Why? Cause how will I make money? There's no high end in Auckland. Only rednecks. Hang on. Hang on. I need nature. I want to wake up in the morning and go outside. And feel my bare feet on the earth, and feel the soil. Without any pressure to be someone I'm not. You should go to New Zealand, honey. Yeah. In New Zealand when I was little My father used to take me wild mushroom hunting in the forest. God, I loved it! I felt like the world was at my feet. And I was filled with super powers. Good evening. Good evening. I've got a condom. Alice? I need you, Alice. I need you so much. I can't get through this without you. I love you. Where? What? You have cheated on me our entire marriage, you have stolen everything I have, so where? Where is this love you're talking about? How long must I grovel like a dog before you understand I didn't choose to do this. I wasn't in control of myself. I'm going to get help but I need your support otherwise I'll never make it. You think I don't know how badly I fucked up? But it's over! All of that is in the past. There are couples who have been through worse, and they're still together. Can't we, can't we... I noticed you don't have your ring anymore. I sold my watch to get an identical one remade. - Alice Marie-Helen Saurel would you... - I can't pretend, Francois. I'm not your whore. I want chocolate. Can I taste some? Can we put some chocolate? - Here! - Okay. I want vanilla. - Vanilla? - Yes, vanilla. And I want to mix it all. It pisses me off. No, I mean, the job title. There are women, victim of human trafficking and there are women like us. And in both cases it's called prostitution. There's no logic! You know, my mother put me in a beauty pageant when I was 5 years old. 5 years old! It's disgusting! She was brainwashed into living a meaningless life. But I'm the devil incarnate. I'm worth nothing. Her words. Your mother knows? My brother outed me. We haven't spoken since. - I'm so sorry Lisa. - Oh I don't care! What about your father? He died. When I was 11 years old. You really don't talk to your mom anymore? No, I don't. She disowned me. So... I did too. I have nothing to say to her. She will regret it one day, when I will have proven her wrong. When I'll have my degree in political science. And I'll probably end up working for the U.N. or something like that. I wonder what my folks would do if they found out. Disown you! Yeah, you're right. Come on! Come out of the closet! 1. 2. 3. I know, there was traffic. I don't know what time I'll be home. I spoke to the bank manager today. I don't have time, Francois. Are you seeing someone? What? No. Who is helping you then? I work, Francois. I have to go. Elegant Escorts, how can I help you? What are you doing here? What is it, Francois? You are the purest person I know. You've been going through my things? Look at me. Together we are going to get through this. I am lost without you. And you are lost without me. I don't feel lost. You won't have to degrade yourself anymore. I don't feel degraded. I have almost saved my home. Jules' home. You should sleep at Olivier's tonight. You still don't understand. I love you more now, not less. I want to be alone. I'd prefer you don't stay here tonight. Hi Jessica. Yes, I can. Not now, I'm late. Please Alice, don't go. I love you, Alice. We can talk when I get back, okay? I can't let you go. I'm afraid it's not your decision. Think of what you're doing. Like you thought about it? You win. We are even. It's over now. Get off me. I couldn't live with myself if I let you go. How dare you tell me what to do? I'm not telling you what to do. I'm stopping you from making the biggest mistake of your life. But it's my life! I decide, not you! I'm not a child. You have no right to tell me what to do! So what, selling your soul to the devil is okay then? Is that it? Sell my soul? Go fuck yourself! I loved you, Francois. I would have given you my whole life. That would have been selling my soul. Now get out my way. You want to get done that badly or what? Let me go. Well, I can do that. Stop! Stop! Stop it! No! No! Get out of my house! Get off my property now! Alice, let's calm down. We're going to calm down. You get out now or I will call the police. I mean it. Calm down. It's going to be alright. - Get out. - Alice. Alice! Hello, Alice Ferrand speaking. You want war? You want war? You can have it. But it will cost you Jules. You think any court of law will see you as a fit mother with what you do? You wouldn't. Wouldn't I? I thought you were running late. Leave Jules out of this! Stop it! Calm down. If I do it, it's for Jules' own good. Hello, it's Jules' mother. Is he there? Yes, he is. Okay. What time was he dropped off please? Around 8:20. Okay, thanks. Is everything alright, Mrs. Ferrand? Yes, everything is fine. Have a nice day, bye. Thank you for coming so quickly. He can't prove anything, as long as you are careful. You can claim it's perjury. He's got my work mobile and my personal mobile. All my escort activity is recorded on my work mobile. I don't understand. He was addicted to escorts. That makes him a bad husband, not a bad father. Why is it different for me? I did it to take care of my child. He stole all of our money. -Of course that will help your case but... - But? - Look Sophia... - Alice. Alice, children make the procedure highly emotional. The court will see a father who is a manager of a reputable company, and on the other hand... a mother who prostitutes herself. I'm sorry to sound so harsh but... That's what you will be dealing with if you and your husband go through with this. Tell me what to do. Find all the evidence of his use of escorts, that he liquidated your accounts. Make copies, a lot of copies. Okay. Alice... When it comes to society's morals and ethics, there will always be innocent victims. Keep out of court. Do what you can, but don't go there, for your own sake. You're going to the pool? Oh nice. Bye. Alice? But François has already picked up Jules. About 15 minutes ago. Ah okay. We must have had our wires crossed. What are you doing here? I wanted to apologize for my behavior last night. But let's not fight. The parent teacher meeting is at 7 p.m. If you want, I can go. - Look at my present, Mommy. - No. I'll finish the washing up then. Yes. No. Why not a little cat? - No. - Why not? Family Court Attorney: Specializing in Child Custody. I'm going to lie down for 5 minutes, then I'll get ready, okay? Of course. Alice, you're calling my work phone? I've left you about 10 messages. Congratulations for your apartment. - Alice? - Yes? Are you okay? I lost my phone. - What? - I can't talk now. I'll call you later. Everything okay? Yes, it's fine. I'm coming. Were you on the telephone? A girlfriend, nothing important. Are you okay? Why didn't you call me back? I've left 40 messages in the last 3 days. After all he's done, according to 3 different lawyers he'll get custody. Why didn't you call me earlier? It's such hypocrisy! Prejudice is more powerful than logic. Whose side are you on? Yours. But if 3 different lawyers have the same opinion, shouldn't you listen to them? But they are wrong! Come on Alice, let's sit down. We need to think. Maybe I'm the cause and this is the effect. I'm being punished. That's it, I'm being punished! My God Alice, listen to yourself. Francois is being a monster and you... Shut the fuck up! - Okay, calm down! I'm just saying... - No you calm down! You condemn everything but you think you're any better? You say you're going to get your degree, go work for the U.N. You're so full of bullshit! You're just a hypocrite, Lisa. I'm sorry this is happening to you, Alice. But it's not my fault. - The literary guy. What? - What do you mean? The one who always had a poem or some crap for each part of your body. Oh shit... I didn't know. Obviously I didn't, how could I? If it wasn't me, it would have been another girl. What difference does it make? You're the only real friend I've ever had. And it was you. It was you! You fuck other people's husbands too, you know. No, it's your fault. Are you joking? I was happy until you came along. You want your old life back, go ahead! Your husband wants nothing more, make his day. Go ahead! Everything was fine before. Now, if I don't do what he wants he is going to take my baby. He is going to take my baby! Alice, when is the last time you slept? I can't anymore. You need to sleep to think clearly. I've got something that will help. No, I have to be up at 3 p.m. to get Jules. - If I'm not there... - I will wake you up at 3 p.m. Don't worry. I'm going to take care of you. Sit down. What are we doing here, Alice? You know... You're right about me. Except one thing. I'm not a hypocrite. I'm scared, that's all. And you're not a prisoner. All these years I've done what everyone expected of me. I guess I learnt my behavior. I think. A way of being. Like you learnt yours, maybe...? But ten years from now I want Jules to have learnt how to live by watching me. I want him to learn to know himself. So, I need to learn to know myself. Alice, I don't know... I don't blame you for anything. I take full responsibility for my life and everything in it. Including our marriage. Let's start anew, Francois. You know, even when I lost it, I always believed in us. Always... I miss you. I miss you. Let's start anew. Alice, what's this bullshit? What's this crap? Where are you? Call me back right now. And I mean right now! Alice? Take care of Jules.
