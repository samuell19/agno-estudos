RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Grace, these are exceptional. Really, it's perfect for our holiday getaway page. Where have you been all my life? Home with a baby, divorced with a teenager. I have a guest room with an en suite if you want to share with my mother. You might want to leave that off your eharmony profile. Well, lucky for me I don't have one. Well, maybe you should. You should get out there again. Yeah, so you've told me. What are you doing for the holidays? Well, I'm just, I'm really trying to make it special for Lexi. It's our first Christmas since the divorce. How's that working? Well, if she could box that blame and put it under the tree for me, she would. It's okay. I get it. We've had so many traditions as a family. It's hard for her. Well, how about making some new traditions? Next year, we're promoting a small town in Vermont called Briar Ridge as a Christmas getaway. Used to be primarily a farming town, but they made a real niche with Christmas tourism. We're putting together a full spread. Christmas tourism? That's a thing? It is there. And you need pictures? Lots of them. We rented a chalet that used to be a barn. How fun is that? Bring Lexi and your mom. It'll be good for you guys. Yeah. This is gonna be great. Okay. Lexi, mom. It's time to go. Okay, almost ready. Got the presents. Mom, you know they do have suitcases with wheels, right? Yeah, which break and tear. You know, my day we built things to last. There's no need to change if this baby gets the job done. I know, I know. Should we get groceries? I brought snacks. I can't cook snacks. Okay, well, there's stores in Vermont I'm sure. We'll go shopping when we get there. Okay. Lexi, come on. Let's go. Oh, my goodness. It's like watching Dorothy leave Oz. It's only a week. Yeah, for a teenager that's eternity. I was never that dramatic. That's true. You were worse. Please, mom. Lexi, come on. Let's go. We agreed on this. A little bit of family time. You're gonna be positive. Yeah, there it is. Well, we'll work on it. Let's go. Okay, does anyone want to play "I spy"? Just a second. I'm about to win this next level of Candy Crush. Killed it. What about you, Lex? Lexi? What? - Do you want to play "I spy"? - Does the winner get to go home? Suck it up, buttercup. Your friends will be there when we get back. I'm missing Ashley's Christmas party. Literally everyone is going. Well, I'm not, so not everyone is going. Cody is. There will be other parties, honey. Not with mistletoe. Well, Christmas is for family. We're lucky we can spend it together. Not everyone does. Yeah, like dad. He's family. Why is it okay for him to be alone? Your father is fine. He knows how much we love Christmas, and this town is all about Christmas. That's right. We are gonna have so much fun. Just us girls. Hey, I brought cards for a special Christmas blackjack. Amazing. Maybe afterwards we can play "Old Maid". Wait, we don't have to. Enough, Scrooge. Hi. Hi. It's Whoville personified. Big fan of coffee. Yes. I'm a writer. It's our life force. What do you write? Novels. Airport reads, mostly. Congrats. You qualify for a free cranberry sauce. That's very nice, but no thank you. Oh, come on. It's Christmas. Everybody loves cranberry sauce. Yeah, sure. Throw it in. Maybe I can distill it into a crantini. Jack Manning? You write the "Star Cros" series. Yes. I love how Bo Daniels keeps two candles lit in the window and then Amelia sees them and regains her memory. That's love. It's fiction. So, what brings you to our little town? Writing. I need a hideaway from the holidays to finish my next book. It's hard to escape Christmas around here. Yeah, yeah. Tell me about it. But I'm luckily renting a place in the country, so... Oh, well, then you should totally come to our Christmas Night of Lights. There's a winter dance and everything. Honestly, it is the most fun you will have all year. Well, except maybe for the Christmas Day polar bear plunge. I'm gonna take a pass. Yeah, you're not really a Christmas person are you? What gave it away? I'm gonna give you a flier anyway, and if you need anything come on by. - My name's Charlotte. - Nice to meet you, Charlotte. You know, I can't believe this town still has a livery. Yeah. Why, do you need to board your horse? I'm good. - See ya. - See ya. Hey. My weather app shows a storm's coming. Maybe we should have left earlier. Really, mom. You think? Well, hopefully we'll make it to the chalet before it hits. And what if we crash? - I've lived a full life. - I haven't. My last meal. Corn nuts and something called sour patch children. The gourmand community will not be attending my funeral. Now who's being dramatic? Well, you both come by it honestly, I figure. What the... No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Sorry, Santa. This place is not big enough for the both of us. No way. Not. Nope. Absolutely not. Holy Christmas. Is Briar Ridge this exit or the next one, mother? I don't know. The little wheel thing keeps spinning. O-M-G. It is like the blind leading the blind, which, frankly, is offensive, because they'd have the common sense to stay home in the first place. Okay, I'm just gonna take the next exit. - It stopped spinning. - Really? Oh, wait. It's spinning again. Shavin' soap. Hey, Steve. Jack, buddy. How are you? - How am I? I'm in Briar Ridge. - I know. Great, right? Tucked away from civilization, just like you asked. No, no, no. I asked you to get me a place away from civilization and Christmas, and yet, somehow, you've managed to imprison me in a Norman Rockwell painting. Best I could do on such short notice, besides, you should be chained to your laptop, banging away at that final chapter that you promised me by Christmas. How am I supposed to work in this environment? You know, I'm starting to feel like you... - Do you even know how it ends? - I know how it ends. Okay, how? They shoot the dog. Come on, please. You got to give me some credit here. That's worked once in literary history. Give me a hint. You're just gonna have to wait. Okay, how about this? The grand romantic gesture. You're great at that. Not this time. Jack, the publisher really wants another "Star Crossed" novel. This little venture of yours, it's making them a little nervous. Actually, a lot. Yeah, but see, this is gonna be a real novel, Steve, alright? This is gonna be the one they remember me by. The only thing that publishers remember are sales. Star Crossed sells. You better have a follow up on the backburner. A fail safe. Yeah, well, thank you for the faith in me as always. Hey, I got faith in you. You're like my Starbucks. All the times I've been in there, they've only screwed up my latte, like, twice. Yeah, well, this is the sound of your vanilla soy latte hanging up on you. Come on, don't be like that. Merry Chris... Marry Christmas, Jack. "The heart needed protection to survive. Room to grow. The abyss was full of..." Purpose? No. Purpose. The abyss was full of... Full of something. I'm so excited. We are here, ladies. It looks nice, huh? It's gonna be a very Merry Christmas. There's supposed to be a key under the mat. Are you sure you've got the right address? Oh, well. Guess we're gonna have to go home. A-ha, see? They left it open for us. Wait, that seems strange. What if there's a burglar? Really, mom? You saw the downtown. It looks like Mayberry. - Yeah, it could be a squatter. - Maybe we should call the police. Would you two stop thinking the worst? It brings bad luck. Caution never got anyone killed. Neither did central heat during a storm. Come on. It's freezing out here. - Gran, is that mace? - Never leave home without it. See? It's empty. Thought you said there'd be decorations. There's supposed to be. That's what Nancy said. Do you smell coffee? Ted Bundy liked coffee. Burglars don't make coffee during a heist. Hello? What is that mace? What the... What is wrong with you? Well, it didn't break the skin. So, no chance of scarring. Really? Because Roger Clemens over there put a lot of heat on it. Your gram's still got it. Alright, sorry about this, but you startled us. - I startled you? - Yes. I'm the one who should be calling the police to report a home invasion. I don't, I don't understand. Aren't you with the leasing company? No, I'm not with the leasing company. I rented this place. Who are you? What are you doing in my chalet? Grace Olson. Mitcham. This is my mother, Helen, my daughter, Lexi. There has to be some kind of mix-up, because the company I work with leased this place for the three of us. 318 Mountain Drive? Yes. I've got to make a phone call. Be my guest. There's a phone upstairs and the leasing company is on speed dial. Great. And... and do me a favour. Keep the sharp objects away from your grandmother, please. Thank you. Yes, I will hold again. Yes, yeah. No, I'm sorry, that is completely unacceptable. You're gonna have to fix it. It's your mistake. You're in in the morning? Great. We will handle this in person. Thank you. Oh, brother. Okay, turns out they leased the chalet to both of us, and on top of that, everything else is booked. Marvellous. Well, since he was here first, I guess that means we have to go home. Hold on, not so fast. We have the same claim that he does. Besides, I have work to do here. I... I... I have work to do. I have a lot of work to do. Can we talk for a second? - Are we doing that now? - Over here, please. Okay, hear me out. I really, really need this for my family, okay? We've been through a rough time lately, and this, this Christmas getaway, it may be the healing that we, that we need. Look, guys, I'm sorry. Really, I am, but I was here first. I've already unpacked. I got groceries. Looks like you raided a gas station. Slim Jims? - They still make these? - Yes. Can't you do your creative writing somewhere else? Creative... creative writing. I would hardly call a 50,000 initial print run "creative writing". Okay, tell me what you wrote. It's a series, actually. It's called "Star Crossed". You're Jack Manning. What? The Jack Manning. I thought you looked familiar. You're right, it is him. You look thinner on the jacket cover. Mom. I had a lot of salt for lunch. It's nice to meet you both. I am such a huge fan. I mean the way you make Bo so human is so good. Especially after he does all those horrible things, but he's doing them for the right reasons. Yes, yes. He's doing them for, for... - Love! Right. - For love. You got it. Bo Daniels is a dream. You know, so is Sam Steed, but I am so Team Bo. That's what you say right? Team? Yup, Team Bo, you got it. And the reunion in the Rose Garden with Amelia? When he thought that he had lost her forever. - Yeah. - I mean, it's magical. And when they danced barefoot in the grass? The two candles to light the way. - The twin flames. - Twin flames, yes. Yes. Everybody, read them. Great. So romantic, but they really messed up with casting Zac Efron in the movie. He was far too young for the role. I agree, it should have been Tom Hardy. Yes! Thank you. I'm sorry. You wrote those novels she loves? Yes, guilty. You see, guys, you see why it's so important for me to be here? To work? Well, we could all stay here together. What? There are three bedrooms. I mean, you could take one, and Lexi and I could take the one with the bunk beds, and Jack could have the upstairs bedroom. I'd prefer the couch. No, no, no. We don't even know this man. Excuse me, excuse me. This man rented this chalet for the peace and quiet, and I'm sorry, but if three's a crowd, then four's a stampede. Well, looks like nobody's going anywhere in that storm. Okay, fine, fine. Then, I get the upstairs. That's mine. Off limits, okay? Okay, and we will visit the leasing company tomorrow and try to figure out this whole mess. - Fine. - Okay, let's go get our stuff. I can't believe we're gonna share this place with Jack Manning. Perfect, except you take the top bunk. I go to the bathroom too many times. Every two hours. Up, down, up, down. Okay, too much information, grandma. Jack. I know this situation is a little bit strange, but we don't have any food, just corn nuts and candy. Well, according to, grandma? Helen. Helen. My food selection isn't much better. Well, you're just lucky I'm a great cook. I'll treat it like a bit of a mystery box challenge. I mean, I've always wanted to work with hot pockets. - Knock yourself out. - You won't be disappointed, and we will pay you for the groceries. Don't worry about it. There's, some wine there, as well, if you like. Okay. So, what kind of work brings you to Vermont at Christmas? I'm a photographer. I work for a travel website. They are putting together packages to visit Briar Ridge next season. Well, hopefully they don't advertise the chalets because the customer service is terrible. That's true. Well, I'm not gonna get any shots. I mean, they were supposed to decorate this place for Christmas, and nothing. Well, maybe you're in the wrong chalet. - How long did you book for again? - New year's. And you don't miss family over the holidays? No, no. It's... It's just my mom and her fourth... Fifth. Her fifth husband, and to be honest, I could be alone with them or without. - I didn't mean to pry. - No, that's okay. I'll spare you the details, though. But if you really want to know about it, I'm sure you can find it in some form or another in one of my books. You know, my daughter, Lexi, is like that. She got this assignment in fifth grade to keep a journal. She has been doing it ever since. In fact, I think those notebooks know her better than I do. - How old is she? - She is fifteen. That's a fun age, for her anyway. Tell me about it. She went from crayons to lip gloss over night. I mean, she used to cling to my leg, and now I spend, well, half my time trying to talk to her through the bedroom door. So. Well, we all need our space. Yeah. What does her dad think? Well, my ex-husband sees none of it. Lexi thinks he walks on water. Is that why you're here? 'Cause of the divorce? Tom was a lousy husband, but he was an excellent father, and it's just been really hard on Lex, and I was... I was hoping that this Christmas getaway could make things easier for the two of us. It can only go up from here. I will let you know when dinner's ready. Actually, I... I'm not gonna eat. - I got some work to do, so... - Of course. Your deadlines. Yes, deadlines. I'll be upstairs. Enjoy. Well, at least the plates are festive. See? Things are looking up. It's just the three of us. - No Jack? - He had to work. You two are becoming fast friends. What? Saw you by the fire. We were discussing the food situation. Sure. Alright, get your taste buds ready to take a walk on the wild side. That's a fancy grilled cheese. No, it's better. It's an improvised Monte Cristo. What's in it? Slim Jims, Swiss cheese, and cranberry. Sounds so good. - Where's Jack? - He had to work. - No, no, no. That won't do. - Mother, please don't do this. No. Not happening. I wanted to eat. - Jack! Dinner is ready. - No thanks. I'm good. Oh, dear. You are too good a writer to be punishing yourself at that nonsense. But it's what I do. Not tonight you don't. You need the kind of brain food only a Slim Jim Monte Cristo can provide. - Really, I have to work. - Not on an empty stomach. I mean, besides, what self-respecting author would turn down a sandwich based on an Alexandre Dumas classic literary tale? You're not gonna leave even if I ask you to, are you? I am not. Alright, I will celebrate my love of Dumas by joining you for dinner. I was hoping you would. Evening, everyone. Evening. Looks delicious. Thank you, Helen, and congrats on finding a proper use for the cranberry sauce. Well, I was only brought along for my cooking. Have to earn my keep. That is so not true, although it certainly helps. It's an important skill to have. The way to a man's heart is through his stomach. That's how I snagged your grandpa, God rest his soul. You keep that in mind with your friend Cody. Okay, sure thing, gram. And Jack, you're too thin. Is no one cooking for you? Mom. No, no, but, thank you for saying I'm thin. So, this is your family Christmas vacation? That was the idea. Well, the best laid plans of mice and men. Often go awry. Did you know that Steinbeck didn't coin that phrase? He stole it from a Scottish poet. "To a mouse" by Robert Burns. So, what's it like being the king of ya novels? Not that exciting. I'm not as sappy as my stories. Quite the opposite, actually. Really? So, what do you consider a romantic gesture? A romantic gesture. Shoveling someone's snow. Hah, I don't remember reading that in your books. Well, because it doesn't sell, but when you think about it, shoveling someone's snow is a selfless act that says, "I'll make a way for you". It's symbolic. Yeah. And here I was thinking Paris. No, Paris, that's overrated. If you shovel someone's snow or scrape the frost off their windshield, or warm up their car. They say that life is in the details, but I think you can find love there, too. Can we keep him? You know, maybe put up a sign that says, "lost writer", and if no one comes to claim him in a few weeks, he's ours. No one will claim me, I promise you. Well, he talks a good game. So, what's a romantic gesture for you? Easy, one word. Respect. Respect, please. You only brought us here so you could punish dad, but you were talking about love so I stand corrected. Lexi. What? Okay, it's true. You're the one that broke up our family. That's enough. I'm not hungry anymore. - Wine, anyone? - Yes. Please. Yeah, I wanted to apologize for that little episode earlier. Lexi's a good kid, she's just, like I said, she's having a rough time. Well, adolescence is a rough time, but maybe you shouldn't be the one apologizing. Why do you say that? I just feel like people coddle their kids too much these days, and the kids don't face real consequences. Coddle? Okay, I didn't mean to use the word "coddle". How about protect? She is my daughter. That is my job. Hey, I didn't mean to offend you. I'm so used to being blunt in my head, that sometimes I forget... When we're not in your head? Yeah. Real person here, not one of your characters. I know. It's just that I'm an observer. That's how I write, and sometimes I see people and they're hearing and not listening, or they're viewing others the way they want them to be as opposed to how they are. Okay, yeah, I get that. It's easy to say that when you're not in the game. But when you're in the game you just do the best that you can. How many kids did you say you had again? Okay, you know what? You're right. It's not my place. No, it's not. Of course. Hey, there's my girl. Hey, dad. She makes breakfast too. Nothing fancy, just french toast. Coffee? Yes, please. So, did you get any writing done? What can you tell me about Bo and Amelia? Please tell me that jerk Tucker Casey hasn't broken them up. Actually, I'm not working on a "Star Crossed" novel. Really? Well, what are you working on? Well, it's this story about a son reconnecting with a father he though abandoned him. Does it have a happy ending? I don't know yet. See, the son blames the father for the failures in his own life, and he's emotionally cut off, very aloof, in a word, selfish, and he has a tendency to sabotage relationships. - He's terrified. - Okay, he's not terrified. It's a little bit more complex than that. Well, maybe he learns how to trust family again. - At Christmas. - Maybe. You know, I'm actually striving for a little bit more complexity in this one. Well, I'm not a writer, but I sure like simple. Yeah, you and 20 million other people. Well, good morning. Hey, your mom made breakfast. Oh, no. I'm good. Just having a coffee. Ready to go? Okay. Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll have this later. Unbelievable. It's closed because everyone has the flu? Is this a joke? Well, it is a small town. What did you expect? I... I... I needed this. You keep saying that but you haven't actually told me why. I am a photographer. I have a job here. My family hasn't been on a vacation in forever. I'm not talking about that. Those are just details. I'm asking for the reason. The real reason. Because I'm afraid that I'm losing her to him and I can't lose her, okay? You think you're gonna lose her over one day? I mean, Christmas is one day. I know that, but I gotta try. You know, I gotta start somewhere. Okay, fine. I'll pack up. I'll hit the road. And, I hid the Christmas decorations in the basement. Jack, what about your novel? I should be able to write anywhere. What am I talking about? I'm doing it right now. I think it's really admirable you want to do something nice for your daughter, Grace. I hope it works out for you. I know something that might help. - What's that? - You. If you stayed, I mean. Lexi wants to be a writer because of you, and I think she uses the writing to process her feelings. It would really be good for her if you stayed. You want me to stay with you? With, with all of you? All of us together? I don't know. Why should the rental company be the only one to benefit from this mix-up, and nobody should be alone on Christmas. I do like the view. You'd have to respect my boundaries. - I'm on as deadline. - Of course. Alright, how does this work? Paint me a picture. I get the upstairs, your mother still cooks, I'll buy the groceries, but no Christmas decorations. Yes on everything except the Christmas decorations. You can have your Grinch's lair upstairs, but we get to decorate the rest of the house. Fine, but no tree. Definitely a tree, and we split groceries. You can have a tree, but no Christmas music, and I'm firm on this one. Christmas music until 5:00 pm, because my mother needs it to bake the cookies. This is a negotiation. You're supposed to actually give me something. I am giving you something. I'm giving you cookies. Deal. I guess we should get some groceries. Great, I'm just gonna get my camera. Get some pictures. Have you always loved photography? Yeah, it was a hobby that became more in the last year of my marriage. An escape, I guess. What do you love about it? It's easy. You can make the perfect frame. And what if reality doesn't live up to the expectation? Well, you make it so. You construct it. You build the perfect picture. You manufacture the ideal. That's about right. It's a lot like writing YA novels. Oh, my goodness. There's a town livery. Okay, I love horses. I gotta go over there. I'm... I'm gonna take some pictures, okay? Look, just like your book. Thought you didn't read my books. Lexi told me. Sadly, it's just one. You need two candles for twin flames. Aren't they sweet? Yeah, I think this guy likes me. Just have to be gentle. Show no fear. They pick up on it. Not scared. Maybe a little. Did you grow up on a farm or something? No. We used to take Lexi riding when she was a little girl. She loves horses too. Those were good times. Family outings. I can't say I know much about those. My dad left when I was really young and my mom had a different boyfriend every month who she preferred over me. I find that hard to believe. No, I'm serious. This one time, she cancels a trip to Disneyland to cart me off to Augusta, Georgia, so her boyfriend, Clyde, could watch the masters. Let me tell you, that is a thrilling trip for a seven year old. What about Christmas? I got gifts I guess, but it was just another day. I never really saw the magic in the season. Well, we are gonna change that. Oh, you are, are you? You're not that powerful. Three generations of Mitcham women and this town? You don't stand a chance, Mr. Grinch. Do you think you've seen Christmas? Because you ain't seen nothing yet. Really? Come with me. Bye, horses. Lead the way. What did I tell you? Pretty perfect. Hi. Thank you. You coming in? Hello, again. Hi. Your store is amazing. How old is it? We opened in 1901. There's been several renovations since then, but the original owner used to live in a room above the store. Where the candle is? Yes, ma'am. It's our way of honouring him. It's just... we're getting it. Here. Would you mind if I take a picture of your Christmas display? It's for a travel website. Well, no. Go ahead. Thank you. Looks like you caught a little Christmas spirit. I wouldn't go that far. More like the chalet rental double booked. Lucky you! Is there a tree lot nearby? You don't waste any time, do you? It was part of the deal. Yes, right next to the llama farm. The... The llama farm. We're going. It's gonna be fabulous. Great, great, great. Merry Christmas. Hi, excuse me. I see you're sold out. Are you getting any other trees in? Boss says it's our last day. Sorry. Merry Christmas, folks. Merry Christmas. Oh, well. It's still Christmas. Even without a Christmas tree. I know, it's just... Well, never mind. What? Lexi and I, the popcorn garland thing was... Well, it was special to us. It's stupid. It's not stupid. Do you ever feel that no matter what you do you are never gonna win? I won't pretend to know about parenting, I'm not gonna make that mistake again, but I know what it's like to be an angry kid. I punched a hole in my bedroom wall once. Great, is that what I have to look forward to? I don't know, probably not, but I broke four bones. Eventually it healed and now I'm stronger than ever. I got a grip like a superhero. She's gonna come out of this, and she's gonna come out this stronger. I hope so. Hey, can I ask you something, and you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but did you find someone else in your marriage? Is that why she's so angry? I did wake up next to someone else. My husband. The man that I thought I knew, I didn't know at all. He'd been cheating on me with our dental hygienist. I am a walking cliché, right? No, no. A cliché would be the nanny. Lexi doesn't know about the affair. She's gonna find out eventually. I know, and it's gonna break her heart. I suppose that's why I'm delaying the inevitable. That's love. Take the hits. So she doesn't have to. Hit or stay? Stay. You're getting too good at this. We're here. They return with groceries. Is that bridge? - Gram's teaching my blackjack. - Are those chips? Well, a girl's gotta learn sometime. So, are we staying? We all are. - As in Jack? - Yup. Look, I know this was supposed to be a girl's trip, but if it's any consolation, I've been told that I'm very, very sensitive. And Christmas is for sharing. Well, it doesn't really feel like Christmas. When are we getting out tree? Yeah, about that, honey. The lot is sold out of trees. So, no tree, no friends, no dad. There isn't even cable here. This is officially the worst Christmas ever. Hey, I taught you blackjack. Hey. You're not coming out here for a smoke are you? I'm fifteen and no, I don't smoke. Too bad. Gram, you smoke? No, no. It's terrible for you. Although, I have been known to do a few terrible things now and then. Really? Yeah, like, like the time I... I told your mother that if she didn't start listening to me, I was gonna return her to the adoption agency. Mom's not adopted. I know, I was angry. Like you are now. I don't know why she's punishing me. Honey, nobody is punishing you but yourself. You know, you give this stink eye long enough, that's all you see. Come on, let's change the view. I want to show you something cool I found. Come on, okay? It's just around by here. It's a little mucky so watch your feet. Watch you footing. Okay. Here it is. This is it. What is it? Like, a wagon? No, it's an old sleigh. Hey, it's seen better days, but, remember, this used to be a barn, and I'm sure that there were horses. Did your mum ever tell you about the Christmas that your grandfather took us on a sleigh ride? No. Your grandfather had just been laid off from the plant, and it looked like it was gonna be a pretty slim Christmas, but he was determined to make it special for his little girl, and he knew how much your mom loved horses. So, on Christmas morning, your mom wakes up to the sound of a neighing horse, and she looks out the window, and there is a horse-drawn sleigh. And we rode all day. Laughing all the way? Yeah. We absolutely did. One of the best days ever. Dad was always promising he'd get mom a horse. Yeah, well your dad made a lot of promises he didn't keep. Never broke a promise to me. Well, you're his little girl and always will be. You know, being a father and a husband, it's two different things, and your dad is a really good father to you. You're lucky to have that special bond. I just don't know why things have to suddenly change after all these years. Lexi, if something falls apart, trust that something stronger is coming together. I'll try, gram. And be kind to your mother. This isn't easy for her. You are her world. We don't even have a Christmas tree. We can't make the popcorn garlands. Hey, it's Christmas. Anything can happen. It's not over yet. Gram said dinner's ready in ten minutes. Thanks, sweetie. I don't know how you do that. You just, you find the beauty, and the rest is background. They have horses. Yeah, a mare and her colt, isn't that great? They're really good. Thank you. Sorry, for the stink eye. You've been talking to grandma. Are you still mad at me? Honey. I'm never mad at you. You are the most important thing in the world to me. Then why did you get divorced? Oh, honey. I'm sorry. I just... I don't know, a million different reasons. And you know what? None of them are gonna be good enough for you. Gram said he broke promises. Yeah, well, when two people are unhappy, a lot of things get broken. That's how you know it's time to move on. You do seem happier working as a photographer. Yeah! Well, you know what? I am, because I love it. It's my little creative outlet. Do you think I could get paid to be a writer? Of course you could! If you work hard enough and never give up, absolutely. Ashley says I wouldn't make any money. Ashley? It's just as important to make a life as it is a living, and if writing is what you want to do, then you go for it, my girl. And look at Jack! I mean, he's on the bestseller list. You think he'd look at my work? Maybe, if you ask him. Dinner's ready! But Jack shooed me in here. He says he's got a big surprise. - Really? - Really. All right, everybody. Close your eyes. Okay. Come on! Eyes closed, no peeking. Eyes closed, please, no peeking! What are you up to? Just a thing, it's just a thing. And we're walking, we're walking. Okay. We're walking, we're not peeking. No. But we're still walking, we're walking. Just a little bit farther. This way, this way, this way. Okay, keep going, just a couple more steps. All right, and... Open your eyes. Is that... I mean, I know it's not a real tree. I love it. It is missing one more thing. Popcorn garlands? Yeah. Popcorn is in my culinary repertoire. Oh, Jack! You done good. Thank you. Come on, Lexi. Help me get the dinner up. Thank you. It's just a ladder with lights. It's our Christmas tree. I'll get it! - Bravo! - Yay! Not only do you sell Christmas, but you deliver it, too. Yeah, we'll hit every home in Briar Ridge before the night is through, isn't that right, Andrew? Yup. I feel your pain. She drags me everywhere, too. - I heard that. - Yeah, me too! We'd better go. Merry Christmas, everyone. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Thank you! Good night! Yeah, okay. I'll hand it to you now here. All right. Okay, now here, give me this side. Okay, okay! Are you sure this is all the decorations? I mean, there might be some more somewhere. I'm not sure. It's a big house. I have an idea! Remember when I was younger and you had us write down wishes, and then, put them in the glass ornaments? We should do that. I'm already on it! I love it, and then, we can paint them like we used to. That means another trip to the north pole, aka the general store. Sounds good. Here we go. Here you go. No, that's a family thing. You guys go ahead. It's Christmas, you're family! Come on. Okay. I'll think of a really good wish. Everybody's ready? All right, ladies first. Where to go, where to go? Where to go? I'm gonna go right here. Perfect. Look at that! Very good. Well, it's time for bed. Come on, bunkmate. Night night, everyone. Good night! See, that was fun. Yeah, it really was. And I didn't even expect it to be. I'm sorry, are you sure you're feeling all right? You're really optimistic right now. Sorry, I got to take this. Yeah, yeah. - Hey. - Hey, buddy! Sorry to call you so late, but I know you're a night owl. Yeah, it's okay. What's up? Hey, I am sorry to call so late. Something happened. The publishers have been interviewing potential ghostwriters for "Star-Crossed". - What? - Why? I just, I couldn't leave him alone at Christmas. Don't be reactive. I'm not being reactive. - Just focus on the present. - Lexi... - The rest... - ...Will sort itself out. - Okay. - Thanks. I don't mean to be greedy, but I hope you can deliver. Hey, where did all of that come from? From under Jack's bed. He said it didn't fit in the closet. The Grinch's heart grew three sizes last night. Yeah, he was actually very cute about it. He's Jack Manning. You'd think he was cute if he was reciting the alphabet. Well, I think you have me confused with yourself. - Mom! - Calm down. He went to town early this morning, and Lexi's still in bed. Hey, help me decorate. I've already got the garland up. I think we could use a few more ornaments up there. All right, and just for the record, Jack and I are just friends. Well... You can say that, but you can't hide that chemistry. I haven't seen you look this radiant since you were pregnant. Mom! Wait, you're not... No, I am definitely not radiant. This trip has nothing to do with me. It's about Lexi, period. Well, I think she'd understand crushing. I am not crushing, and since when did you start saying "crushing"? I'm hip. I like to keep up. I think the very fact that you say "hip" means that you're not keeping up. Wait a minute, are you talking about Cody? Well, she's texting someone all night. Don't tell me that. I mean, I remember when she used to fall asleep with her Etch a Sketch. Relax, I don't think she's rushing into marriage. Don't be so sure, she has our DNA. I was 21 and you were 18. We had no idea who we were yet. Well, maybe if you're more honest with her about divorce, she won't jump into marriage. When does a mother stop judging? When she's six feet under. It's a mother's prerogative! You have it, too. But my opinion doesn't matter. Your happiness does, it always has and always will. Is this your way of giving my divorce your blessing? Maybe. Is this your way of asking for it? Maybe. Oh, Grace. You're raising Lexi with care and love, sometimes at your own detriment, which is so admirable. I'm proud of you. In awe, actually. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. You know, I think there should be a sign. "Parent at your own risk". If there were, there'd be no more children. That's true. And then, what would Santa Claus do? Not to mention all those elves he employs. Mom, I love you. Okay. I am going to find Lexi, see if she wants to go take pictures with me. Maybe she'll talk to me about Cody. Maybe you can talk to her about Jack, too. Goodbye, mother. What do you even want to take pictures of? It's just a bunch of snow. We're gonna take a ride, enjoy the scenery. Give me that. Mom! Let's promise each other something. Two hours, no screens. Can you give me that? It's my Christmas wish. Fine. Yay. This is gonna be fun! This town is cute. It is, right? I hear that it was founded in the 1700s. So, tell me about Cody. You don't like segues, do you? Not when it comes to you, honey. I... I don't know. I like him. Okay, like, more than like. Do you know how he feels about you? I don't know. I mean, I think he likes me. But I'm not sure. I mean, we talk all the time, but to be honest, I'm too scared to ask him. Why were you hoping for your mistletoe moment? Is this your first kiss? Mom, it's not a big deal! You only get the first one once. You have to make sure that he is worth it. Well, was yours worth it? Definitely not! I mean, his gum ended up in my mouth, I gagged on it. I can't even chew grape gum to this day. Sweetie. I totally have whipped cream all over my nose. Yeah. There we go. Cheese! Now, that is like the Tom Hardy of snowmen. Really? I was thinking Zac Efron. Oh, Jack! Where have you been all day? I just went into town to do some writing, a change of scenery. Yeah? See or hear anything interesting? No, no, not like our trip. - Hey, less talking, more sticks! - Yes, ma'am. How is your book coming along? I'm almost finished, but I don't want to force it. The characters are gonna lead me there. Sounds good. Here, mom. Great, great. Let's give this gentleman some arms so he can swing around lampposts and stuff. Right? Isn't that what they do? Yeah, of course. Thank you very much. That's what they do. - Okay. - Yeah. It still needs something more. Jack? What do you think? Need that? Scarf, no, of course not. You know what? It's gonna look much better on him. Perfect! There we go, what do we think? I think it's great. Let's take a picture. Yes, let's take a picture. Picture time. Time, yes. Cheese! Snowman! Okay, okay, one for Instagram. I need my phone. Fine, but I get it back. Thank you. Okay, selfie time. Honey, what's wrong? Cody. He and Ashley... Never mind. So, did Lexi want a plate? She is locked away. Whatever she saw on that phone really took its toll. Do you think she'd talk to me? No offense, mom, but when I was her age and you gave me advice, it never helped. Never have kids, Jack. You go through labour for 36 hours, and they repay you with brutal honesty. I'm sorry, but it's true. Well, nuts to you. I got a brandy and a game of Candy Crush calling. Wait, you bought brandy? Yep, and I'm not sharing. So, you may want to bring your daughter some cookies, and you know, gently remind her that I like to go to bed early. Okay, mama. - Okay? - All right. Night. She won't talk to me. The heart breaks alone. I disagree. The problem is that we can't hear it, so we don't always know. I'm probably the worst person to give advice on love. I think you're the best person. Right, I could just say, "don't worry, honey. "At your absolute best, you'll never be right for the wrong person". Or, "even at your absolute worst, you'll always be perfect for the right one". You know, I think I'm just gonna check on Lexi. - Right, yes, good idea. - Cookies. Lex? I brought you cookies. Your favourite, red and green M&Ms. Oh, honey, you want to talk about it? Not much to say. Ashley posted a video of... her and Cody kissing under mistletoe. I guess he liked her all along. I'm so stupid. You are not stupid. Move over, mama's coming up. My sweet girl. Hey, talk to me. It really, really hurts! I know. I know it does, honey, but you know, that's why they call them crushes. They were never meant to be easy, but they do make us stronger. Is that how you and dad felt? Multiply that by a hundred, maybe a million, and we survived. I know that it feels like your world is ending, but it is just beginning and there will be many more Codys, only ones that won't break your heart. - You sound so sure. - I just know that there will be. Guess I need a new Christmas wish. Well, Christmases are full of surprises. Maybe you will get something better. Honey, save those kisses for someone who deserves them. Not somebody that chews gum! 'Cause I'm pretty sure that Cody is a big-time gum-chewer. Yeah, me too. I called dad earlier. You don't mind? Not at all, you talk to him. Okay, thanks, mom. I love you. I love you, sweetie. My sweet girl. Hey! What is with your family and sneaking up on people? How's it going? I'm done. I sent a draft off to my agent. Congrats! How do you celebrate? With wine. Just a glass, though. Hemingway would be very disappointed. What are you doing up so late? Writing. Hard to sleep with grandma snoring. Is that... I thought it was the radiator. No. Could I ask you a writing question? Yeah, sure! Where do you get your inspiration? Inspiration... The fall. The fall. - Like the season? - No, no, not the season. Like, from pain. You know, going through hard times. 'Cause when you think about it, what do you really know about yourself unless you've been through something really dark, right? I mean, that's what it means to be human, and that's storytelling. - Like heartbreak. - Yes! That's number one on life's crappy hit list. Yeah, it sucks. Don't I know it. Really? Yeah. I've had my heart broken, many times. Badly! And it's not just... girlfriends. I mean, family can be... Brutal. Yeah, harsh. But you got a good one, you're lucky. One of the traps a lot of writers fall into is they think what's in here is the same as what's out there. What's out there is messy and... and complicated, and painful and beautiful, and... If you have the courage to embrace that, that amazing chaos, that's gonna elevate your writing. It's gonna make your characters come to life. Yeah, well, nothing I write is gonna get my parents back together. Maybe not. But if you let it, maybe it'll bring you back together. Would you read some of my stories? They're super short, and... I'd really love some advice from a pro. Yes, I'd be honoured. Absolutely, thank you. Well, I better get to bed. - Thanks, Jack. - Night. Hey... There's this... Christmas thing in town. I'm sure my mom would love to go. Well, I was thinking all of us maybe. Yeah, sure, that'd be fun. Cool. Hey, Jack? If you and my mom ever... You know... Don't break her heart, okay? She's not a writer. And don't chew gum, either. Chew gum. - Trust me. We good? - We good. Night. See ya. Hi, Charlotte. It's Jack Manning. I need a little assist with something. You know, you were right. This... this is fun. I told you. But you want real fun, there is dancing at the pavilion. Really? Oh, by the way, your surprise is all set for tomorrow. Thank you for your help with that. Smile! - It's Christmas. - Yeah! - Hey. - Hi. Andrew wants to show me a night walk. Can I catch up with you guys later? Of course, we'll be at the pavilion. Well, goodbye, Cody. Hello, Andrew. - Shall we? - Well, yes, let's... Lead the way. Pavilion, right? Yep, the pavilion. Before this goes any further, Jack, I have to ask you a question. Okay. Grace is strong, but she's still vulnerable, and I need to know, are you Bo Daniels or Tucker Casey? Those are characters in my books. Are you a saint or a scoundrel? Because if you're a player, I am kindly asking you to skip this turn. A player? Helen, I'm not even in the game. You want to know the truth? I like your daughter. I really do. And every moment I spend with her... I understand why you named her Grace, because she is. What are you waiting for, Jack? Ask her to dance! - Hey. - Hey. - I noticed you weren't dancing. - No. And you know, I'm not dancing either. So, maybe you'd like to... - I would love to! - Dance? All right, yeah, I'll just... I haven't done this in a long time. Me neither. Should we... Talk about last night? I don't know what to say. You could say it was nice. It was nice. It was better than nice. So, Lexi tells me that you're reading some of her stories. Yeah, she's... She's really talented. I hope she sticks with it. Well, whatever you said to her last night, it definitely encouraged her. What did she say that we talked about? Heartbreaks... and how they fuel the writer's imagination. Yeah, it's true. But you know, I'm learning that the opposite is true, too. Well... Okay, keep your eyes closed, everybody. Eyes closed. Eyes closed, watch your step! Watch your step. This feels familiar. Here we go, one more step. Here we go, okay. Eyes closed, no peeking, no peeking and... Surprise! Would you look at that! It was a wreck before! Anybody up for a sleigh ride? We used to do this as a kid. My father... How did you know? I overheard Lexi and Helen talking about it, so I made some calls. This town is incredibly helpful when it comes to surprises. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. - Shall we? - Yeah. Oh, my god! Look at that! It's amazing! Well, my mom is firmly ensconced in front of "It's a wonderful life", and I don't think wild horses or a sleigh pulled by them could drag Lexi away from texting Andrew. Well, it's their loss, because I think that fire is the best fire I've ever made in my entire life. Lucky me! That's good. It's from a can. It's just how I like it. You know, the sleigh ride earlier really took me back. It was from another lifetime. Your dad seems like he was a great guy. He was, and... So are you. No. I'm a plagiarist. I mean, that was his idea. I just stole it. No, you made it happen. I just thought it was time somebody did something nice for you. Well, thank you. Dad's here! What? Your ex is here? I have no idea why, and I should maybe... I'm gonna have to take care of this. Yeah, sure. Sorry. Should I... Maybe I'll just give you some time. Okay, yeah. I'll be... here. Oh, my god, okay. Hey, dad! There's my girl. Tom, what are you doing here? It's Christmas. I want to be with my family. Well, you shouldn't have with all the gifts and... Please, I want to spoil my girls. Hey, I even got something for Helen. Well, I didn't get you anything. Just being here is enough. Honey, your father and I need to speak for a moment, okay? Tom, please? Why are you here? Because I love you. Because I love my family. You made your choice. Look, I was stupid, okay? I was so stupid, and I am... I'm so sorry. If I could take it all back, I would, but I'm not giving up on 18 years, Grace, not for one mistake. Please, don't give up on me. Look, I'm here now, and that is what is important. Tom! Well, I'll be. Who says the devil doesn't celebrate Christmas? I miss that wit. Christmas is about being with the family, and I am very lucky to have such special ladies in my life. Where's Jack? He's upstairs. Who's Jack? Jack Manning. He's our daughter's favourite author. There was a mix-up at the leasing office, and he ended up sharing the chalet with us. Yeah, he's the one that wrote the "Star-Crossed" series. Handsome as he is charming. I'll go get him. Well... You're leaving? I can't stay. Yes, you can. Tom knows you're here. It's not just about this really awkward situation. Then, what? My dad left us, and every Christmas, I only had one wish. That he'd come back, say he was sorry, and that he would love us again. I never got my wish. So, if that means that I have to leave in order for a family to stay together, then that's what I'm gonna do. Now I know where Bo Daniels gets his nobility from. I'm nothing like him. No, you are far better! Would you make sure that Grace gets this? You know, when the time is right. I just wish things were less complicated. Me too. Merry Christmas. - Where's Jack? - His agent called. He said he had to go back to the city. Really? On Christmas? What a shame. I was really looking forward to meeting this charming writer. I'm sure he's got some fancy parties to attend. You know, they lead these adventurous lives, like Hemingway, Kerouac, Hunter S. Thompson. Yeah, Jack's nothing like them, though, dad. He asked me to give this to you. I just need a minute. Jack! So, what you and your mom been up to? - We went on a sleigh ride! - A sleigh ride, really? Yeah, Jack took us. Yeah, your mother always loved horses. Yeah, weren't you, gonna get her one? Lexi, we live in the middle of Manhattan. What are we gonna do with a horse? Let me just clarify something, Jack who just left, he is just... just a friend, right? What does it matter to you? Well, Helen, it matters because it's Christmas, and it's not exactly a great time to parade a new boyfriend in front of our daughter. What would be a better time, Tom? Maybe at Lexi's next dental appointment. With, what was her name, Chelsea? Mama, don't. What does that mean, dad? Did you cheat on mom? Lexi... Did you cheat on mom?! Dad! Yeah. I made a huge mistake, which I deeply regret. This whole time, I... I blamed you. I'm so sorry. I... I'm so sorry! Sweetie, sweetie, it's okay. Your father and I love you very much. Yeah, that'll never change. Lexi, look at me. Look at me. Hey, we're just the background. You're the beauty. Yeah. When you're... when you're ready to talk, you know where to find me. I'm sorry. Oh, sweetheart. Charlotte? Charlotte! Up here! Do you know of any other places around here to rent? It's the holiday season. Everyone's booked solid. Why, what happened? Grace's ex-husband. Even a room, I just need it for a couple nights. We have the room above the store. Yours, no charge, what do you say? I'll take it, thank you. Can't leave, huh? This place has a way. I can leave, just... Not at Christmas. Grace, please don't take my leaving as an escape, but more of a concession. I never equated love with Christmas, but you and your family have proven otherwise. In return, I want to give you the respect that you deserve. Maybe we were always destined to be Star-Crossed. Yours, Jack. Jack! Powerful stuff. You know, I thought I had seen your best heart stuff, too. If only it were mine. You think it'll give you any leverage? And then some! But I do have just one suggestion. What? Just hear me out. We've been on this roller-coaster, this emotional roller-coaster for this whole time with the father and son. Don't you just think they should reconcile in the end? I mean, the son's been looking for the father this whole time! Don't you want him to find him? Life doesn't always work out. Okay, but something to restore the family, metaphorically at least. I mean, otherwise, Jack, it's a bit of a downer. Okay, look, I'm feeling like we need a little epilogue, a little saving grace for the reader to walk away with. It's in there, trust me. Okay, not convincing you. Let's run it up the flagpole with the publishers. Merry Christmas, Steve. Merry Christmas, Jack. Saving grace... You okay? Yes, of course! Honey, I'm with you, and it's Christmas! I'm talking about Jack. Oh, honey, you know, sometimes happy endings only happen in books. Besides, crushes make us stronger, right? All is not lost. What is it? Andrew said the store is closed. Why are they burning candles? They always keep a candle in the window to honour the original owner. Yeah, but there are two! Just like... Like Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! What are you doing here? Well, we went for a hot chocolate, and... I saw the candles. It's like your book. - What about Tom? - Tom went back to the city. Jack, I'm not much of a writer, but I know how I want this story to end. And how's that? The girl tells the boy that she loves him. And... They fall into a kiss that's only for a moment, but that lasts for a lifetime. You're one hell of a writer. Well, I think I'm learning from the best. So, what do you say? Will you come back to the chalet with me? I never left. Sockies! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
