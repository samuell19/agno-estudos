Hello, Ilavarasi. -Hello, sir. Tell me, sir. Sorry for the disturbance, Ilavarasi, for calling you at late hours. It’s okay, sir. Any emergency? Neelankarai inspector Sampath has been murdered by a rowdy. Tomorrow morning, you go to the spot and... ...gather the required evidence for the court and proceed. And also take charge of Neelankarai station, as an additional duty just for tomorrow only. I’ll send a new inspector very soon. Sir, I have lot of work in my station too. No excuse, Ilavarasi. You've to take up the additional duty, tomorrow. Rest, we will talk later. Okay, sir. -Good. (Indistinct voices) Hello! Hey, my dad has left again to our native, looking for a bridegroom. Inform your parents to come asking for bride. It'll settle only if any elders come and talk in our house. Your father said, he will not get you married unless I become SI. Then, what is your problem? See, if you don't tell your mom... -To mom? ...I'll call myself and ask her to come. If anyone comes here without my knowledge, I'll spare you. Hey, why are you speaking angrily? I'm not angry. -You're getting angry, often. Listen to what I say. Ask your mom to come and talk. Else, you come and talk tomorrow. This time you listen to what I say, everything will be fine. Okay, I’ll talk to you tomorrow. (Indistinct voices) The new police inspector has arrived. Hey, has the old inspector died? Who cares if the inspector is dead. Tell them to get the complaint. (Indistinct voices) Hey, mam has arrived. Good morning, mam. Good morning. Everyone here knows me very well. I'm taking up duty here only for today. Let us observe a moment of silence for the departed Inspector. Then, everyone can proceed their work. Okay? -Okay, mam. (Indistinct voices) Why is everyone so silent? (Indistinct voices) May be a silent tribute! (Indistinct voices) Who are you? Mam, he is our station PC. Yeah, I have seen you somewhere! Mam, six months ago, he jumped into the sea and saved the school children. Someone took the video and he became very famous. It was published on dailies too. You might have known. Yeah, even the Commissioner called you and appreciated, isn't it? Yes. You saved the children not fearing for your life. Really great!! Yes, mam. Vasanth's name is likely to be on the promotion short list of next month. Good. Try not to get any black mark. Okay, mam. What's all these crap here? Sir, hand over your ex-Inspector's things to his house. (Indistinct voices) Kumar, tell me. Good, you've my number. Today morning, I got it from the jeep driver. -Okay...okay... By the way, unable to see you in the station. Have to go to investigate a case in the morning. -A dead body has been found under the Kovalam bridge. -Just now the autopsy got over. Who is it? -Mam, it’s a woman. Must be around 35 to 40 years of age. Oh... -No evidence of rape attempt. -It's said she has committed suicide. Her name is Malliga from Neelankarai slum. Oh, is it? Have you informed her house? -Not yet, mam. -I’m going to the court for an old case. -Oh... -That’s why, I called you to inform. Okay, I’ll send someone else. When will you return to the station? -I’ll return by noon, mam. Okay, return at the earliest. Okay? Okay, mam. Okay. Hey, remove your glasses. Who are you? Why are you standing here and there in the police station? From - Anbu. To - The Inspector of police, Neelankarai Kuppam. Name- Malliga. My mother is missing. -It's a woman, must be around 35 to 40 years of age. Her name is Malliga from Neelankarai Kuppam. Constable. -Tell me, mam. Call the PC. Vasanth, mam is calling you. Bring the old FIR files. Mam has asked the completed cases too. Hey, Vasanth... SI Kumar has completed the autopsy of a woman. That woman's name is Malliga from Neelankarai. This boy has come here since his mother is missing. That woman's name is also Malliga from Neelankarai. I think she must be this boy's mother. Take him along and ask him to identify. If she is his mother... ...hand over the corpse at the house. And complete the other formalities and you come. One more thing, until you reach there... ...you don’t tell him what has happened. Okay, mam. -He is too young. Okay. Hey, boy! have you come alone? My father. Where? Mam, the jeep is ready to go to the spot. (Indistinct voices) What? Have you given the autopsy report to her? Sir, she came here temporarily from the next station. If she asks, will you give right away? Don’t keep talking unnecessarily, hang up the phone. Nonsense in the morning. Congratulations, Murthy sir. For what, sir? Definitely, you've a chance to get promotion in this case. Thank you, sir. The nation has gone haywire to the extent of killing an Inspector. Now, who is taking charge as new Inspector? The Inspector from Thiruvanmiyur. Thiruvanmiyur... That is J6 station. You mean the woman Inspector? Yes... -She is very strict. She has arrived. Go and do your work. Sir, wait. Move away. step back. Good morning, mam. -Good morning, Murthy. Are you doing good? -I'm good, mam. Good catch. Thank you, mam. Murthy, as shown in films... ...did you tell them to kill and waiting down with the gun? Oh, gosh, mam! I was just kidding, Murthy. Has everyone arrived? Yes, everyone has arrived mam. Then, let's finish soon and send to the court. Yes, mam. Mam, you go. Murthy. -Mam. Is this your Inspector's own house? -No, mam. This is the house of someone known to the Inspector. But, he will stay here only. Oh, is it? I inquired at the station. They say there was an old enemity between the Inspector and the murderer. Is it a fact? -Yes, mam. The Inspector once arrested him in a brothel case. May be that animosity also. Why? Any problem mam? Nothing like that, Murthy. The Assistant Commissioner has told to check all the details of this case... ...and send it to the court. That's why. Murthy, I got the autopsy report of the Inspector. Tell to hand over the corpse to his house. Okay, mam. If everyone is ready, bring him. -Okay, mam. What’s your name? Ramar, mam. Look, how you entered and how you murdered the inspector... ...you pronounce and demonstrate everything. Okay, mam. I'll come to this bungalow, often. Yesterday I came here because he suddenly called me on phone. I was sitting here. Inspector was sitting there, mam. We both started to booze. He got little high, suddenly. He spoke filthy about my wife. He also spoke filthy about my mom. I got angry and killed him. When you were slaying, where was the Inspector sitting? He was sitting here. You demonstrate again, how you slayed him? I slayed him like this, mam. Once more. I slayed him like this, mam. Not that, Ramar. You demonstrate the actual speed you enforced when you slayed him. Mam...mam... Shall we put on the handcuffs for safety? Sir, don’t be afraid. We will not murder a policeman... ...unless they cause us trouble. Mam, you don’t be afraid. Did you see his arrogance? If a policeman troubles him, will he murder? Murthy, bring him to the police station. I’ll will go home and come back. Okay, mam. Send all phone call records of the Inspector to my table. Okay, mam. And also the knife stand. -Okay, mam Sir, we caught the accused, right? Instead of signing the paper and sending him to the court... ...she banged the accused and torturing to send the evidences to her table. My promotion is depending on this case, sir. Hey, she has grudge on your police station. She has terrific police intelligence. I know well how the police will thinks, sir. Henceforth, you will know who and what kind of man is this Murthy. I don't need to know anything. Tell me if you get promotion. I'll come. Constable, did you see Murthy sir? Mam is calling. Hey, wait. I'm coming. Come, sir. Yes, mam. Sir, the Inspector's autopsy report, the murderer Ramar's statement... ...everything is messed up. I don’t understand. What's that messed up, mam? It’s clearly written in the autopsy report that the inspector was killed with a Rambo's knife. But, you've submitted an ordinary knife. Mam, when he came out of the bungalow... ...He had only this knife. Even the inspector's blood was in it. That’s the confusion for me, Murthy sir. When checking the Inspector's call records, he didn't call him. But he has given a statement that the Inspector has called him. Inspector died at 1 o'clock. At 2 o'clock, someone from ECR tower has called Ramar. At that moment, Ramar was at Adyar tower. He has come to the ECR tower within the next half an hour. After a while, both the numbers were switched off. I tried to trace who would've called. But, I couldn't trace. The spot he slayed and where the victim had fallen was somewhere else. Sir, with all these confusions, we can’t submit him at the court. Whatever, I'll do a small enquiry and then produce him to the court. Mam, that is... I mean. I understand, Murthy sir. In this case, you've a chance for promotion. For that, I can’t produce a wrong evidence to the court. Please understand, sir. I'm leaving, mam. Sir, is this your number? Nothing, sir. This number was on the list. Yeah, why did you talk to him for ten seconds last night? That is... I updated him about the toll plaza rounds, mam. Okay, sir. I just asked. You go and carry on your work. Hey, this is the ECR case. Neelangarai station. Come in. Hey, Mari pack that dead body quick. His relatives are waiting outside. We can get some amount, and we can share it. Hey, you... Have you killed my wife? I'll kill you all. Hey... -I'll kill you all. Hey, wait. Hold him. Hey, my wife. Hold him. Come here. Leave me. Bring him out. -Hey, leave me. Bring him. -Leave me. Hold him well. Don't leave him. Go out. Throw him out. Get lost. Go away. Hey, lift him. -You killed my wife. Move away. Hey boy, shall we go? (Mourning voices) Malliga! (Mourning voices) Meena, I’m telling you, right! Your father will keep saying the routine. It’s okay, sister. At least, ask what he says and tell me. If I go inside, he will scold me, sister. I’ll give you Rs.200 you asked for. -Okay. Also you've to give the balance of Rs.100. I’ll give you. Go. The department's postings will be announced this month. Chances are there to get. Only chances are there, but yet to get confirmed? Isn't it? Don’t mistake me. Only daughter, I brough her up with all my love. Getting my daughter married to the one standing on the road and saluting... Hope you will understand. Shall I stop saluting? It's the only job you've in the police department. What would you do if you quit that too? I've come across many policemen. You're leaving without saying anything. Within a month, I will get the posting. I have that hope. I’m leaving. He too irates. What happened? He is irritating me, sir. What is he saying? For every two months, he is asking me to become a SI or a policeman. He might even ask me to become a CM. Who is that? Is she your girlfriend's sister? She is the maid, sir. A maid! When the maid itself is awesome... It seems to be a rich alliance. He is a stingy. Damn it. (Indistinct voices) Hey Anand, Where are you? (Indistinct voices) Oh, have you started? Have you come? That's nothing, dear. Akhila is going to get the certificate tomorrow, isn't it? So, looking for a place to keep it. It's enough if she wins in single round. You shower your love only on your grand daughter. Anbu has won in an essay contest at Mary temple fest. Did you bring that cup? I've brought that yesterday itself and kept here. You can remember only that. How do I run with this ripped shoe? Hey, take your shoe. Oh, no! That's ripped pretty bad. It's sticked well, look at it. Aah, grandpa! My lucky shoe is glued. Give it, let me see. Malliga. I'm going to the Police training academy. I'll bring Joe while coming back. His shoot would've been over. Are you going to the ground with her in the morning? Yes, I'll take her safely. Bye. Come, Anbu. Anbu, did you see your dad? I saw him on the way. He is with Gaja brother at wine shop. He said he will be late tonight. He isn't listening me if I tell him not befriend that wastrel. Let him go to hell. Sir. Hi, Murthy. You've come early in the morning. You said that you'll meet the Minister, tomorrow. Yes. So? Sir, regarding the promotion. Getting posting in any place is fine. Why are you in hurry, Murthy? What is that you've done for me? To recommend for your posting. Sir, it’s me who is getting you the bribe at station... ...and also arranging the 'mango' you ask for. You're talking as if you plant a sapling, nourish it with fertilizer... ...grow it as a tree, fetch a mango from it and giving me. You're bringing the one who stands on the road. They will come even if I call. I expect something else from you. Look here Murthy, we can't post ten people for a station. It’s for only one person. Already, Vasanth's name is being recommended for it. Above all these, if you want me to help you... Either you get some big case, Else, make the people at station to believe that you've got a case. With your experience and the case, I'll be able to speak to the Minister. Till then, what you do is... Find for a new mango. Do you understand, Murthy? Okay, sir. Go, do your duty. He came early morning asking for promotion and irritating. Brother... Did he give or not? Brother... Brother, that is... Did he give or not? -Brother... Hey, you... I'm asking you, tell me. Brother... Brother... He gave it, brother. Give me. -Take it, brother. Brother, he gave this and told the other thing. He said, he will give bribe to hooligans not to middlemen like us. Idiot. Damn it. Idiot. That Inspector must be... Hello. Murthy, sir. I don’t know what will you do. Your inspector should die, I must slit his neck with my hands. The entire city must know this. Hey just now you came out. Can't you keep quiet? Sir, I'm unable to go around. The entire city should know that I've murdered him. That’s pride for me. It’s not easy to murder a policeman. You will be encountered, be careful. Sir, I don’t know all those. Something must be done to him. Damn it. -Brother... Hey, go and check wherever the Inspector goes. Okay, brother. Hey, you too go and search. Brother, why is our boss writhing to kill the policeman? What's that in the paper? Hey, this is not the only business to him. Earlier, he did business with women. The Inspector is a paramour. Our brother was the one who sent women, everyday. One day, inebriated to the core, he asked for our brother's wife. Did he send her? -He banged him. Then? -What to say? Will the policeman leave if he was banged? So, he caught our brother, stripped him and imprisoned in brothel case. He got a good name in the department. But our brother was humiliated. Just now he came out free. He would've seen himself naked on paper. That's why, he is furious on the Inspector. No one will respect him, henceforth. Hey! no, dude... No, he is a new guy. Should respect him. We will make it. You... How dare you speak ill about my brother in my presence? Hey, dude! -Hey. I shouldn't see him, hereafter. Get lost. Malliga sister!

Mom, I’ll come back with money. Okay, come soon. Don’t know who it is. Is your father back? You go inside. Go fast. Dad said he is going out of station. Did he cancel the trip and come back? Oh, no! Malliga sister! Why are you coming at this time? I need a big help from you. Come inside. Tell me sister, what is it? I urgently need Rs.20,000. Meena, don’t tell me that you don't have.

I’ll get money, tomorrow. I’ll return the money for sure. Somehow give me the money, Meena. Okay, sister. I’ll bring what I have. You be here, okay? Sister, this is what I have now. I'll get you the balance after dad arrives. This isn't enough, Meena. Please check whether there is anything else. I don't have, sister. If I had, I would've given you. Getting late for class, sister. -Please check, Meena. Okay, be here. She too irates. Coming at odd hours and scratching for money I have my college fee Rs.2000 Adjust with that. Nowadays, you often ask for money and bothering more. Sister, be there. I don't know where I've kept the bureau key. Just wait. What to do with Rs.2000 It won't be sufficient. Isn't there any other time for asking debt? Hey, don’t you have sense? Don't you drive carefully? -Hey, take the vehicle. Hey, that’s the parking place for Inspector's vehicle. Hey, take the vehicle. Is this place allotted for your inspector? For that, will you bump the parked vehicle? Wait, I’m coming. Sir, you started to sleep when we left Kuppam, we've reached the station. you're sleeping still. Get down, sir. Sir, your driver bumped on my vehicle. Hey, it looks like an old seized vehicle. Better move the vehicle. Does this look like a seized vehicle? -Is this your number? Who called in the night? Tell me...tell me... Murthy sir. How about your SI Murthy? Mam, he is a psycho. -He slayed him at different spot... -The Inspector was sitting there, mam. -He was lying at different spot. -It's clearly written in the autopsy report that the Inspector was killed with Rambo knife. -But, you've submitted an ordinary knife. Mam, as you said, the corpse was the boy's mother. I got signature in the autopsy report and handed over the corpse in their house. What is said in the report? Mam, there is no evidence of rape. They said that she probably had scratches as she fell from the bridge. Did you enquire the character of the woman? She is a good woman. Is she your neighbour? I’m asking whether you enquired in the neighbourhood? Yes, drunkard husband and he has borrowed money from many. She died falling from the bridge, right? Yes. Which bridge? Kovalam bridge, mam. You mean, Kovalam bridge? Her house is in Neelangarai. How could she go there at midnight and die there? She went by share auto, mam. Share auto? No, you asked how she went. That's why, I said she would've gone by share auto. Oh... You go. Okay, mam. Brother, Why is the station so silent? Go and see in the godown at back. Vasanth, Murthy sir called everyone to Inspector's room. Everyone come soon. Murthy, why have you come as a clan? Is he awake? You work only for today in this station and leave. Anyway, a new Inspector will join tomorrow. You know very well. If an inmate dies at the police station, what a big problem it'll be... What can we do for that, Murthy sir? You saw yourself, right? If we had hit him still, we could've got the truth. He would've died if we hit him still. If you thrash him in the station, it's a problem only to us, mam. It's said that four people from this station may get promotion. At this point, it's not right for you to do so, mam. Murthy sir, even if I work for only one day, I'll do it perfectly. I'll hand over myself to the new Inspector. For me, it certainly looks like he didn't do the murder. This is not the knife used to do the murder. If knocked him more, He would've definitely told me who told him to do it... ...and on what intention he was told to do it. It’s not at all wrong, mam. You get permission from AC and take him alone... ...hit him or kill him or do whatever. But we all aren't comfortable of what you do in the station. This will affect all of us. Please, understand. Okay, Murthy. Now, what? He is unconscious, right? You take him to the hospital and bring him back. By then, I'll speak to the AC and get permission. I’ll enquire him by myself and then produce him to the court. Because of me, I don’t want your station's name to get spoiled. Okay? Move away. Sir, his medication is over. Doctor said you can take him. Okay. (Indistinct voices) (Indistinct voices) They said to take him. (Indistinct voices) Key, sir. Ramar's cuff key. (Indistinct voices) Hey...hey... Take away the knife. I'll shoot you. Take the knife. Hey... Go back. Hey... Go back. Hey, Vasanth! Leave him. Come on, Vasanth. Listen to me. Take away the knife. Hey, drop the gun and go back. -Hey Ramar, drop the knife. Else, I'll slit your Inspector's neck. Vasanth! Hey, Ramar... Go back. Drop the knife. I'll cut his throat. Hey Ramar... -Go back. Take away the knife. Don't tell me anything. Take away the knife. Enough of listening you. Hey, go back. -Take away the knife. The knife may scratch him. Hey, I'll shoot you. Drop the knife. Listen to us. Vasanth. Hey, listen to us. Hey, listen. Go back. Hey, listen to me. Go back. Hey... It might scratch him. Hey, Ramar! Hey, the knife might scratch. Hey... Hey, move away. Might fall on the public. Hey, Ramar... Hey, listen. Won't you listen if I say? Go back. Sir...sir... Go away... Else, I'll slit Hey, I'll slit his neck. Listen to me. Go back. Hey, leave sir. Hey, listen to us. Ramar, leave him. Call him. Call him, immediately. Hey, hey Ramar! Leave him. Leave him. I'll slit (Indistinct voices) Sir. I shot only the pot. What's that? Why does the dog bark? Constable, what's the noise there? Mam, a dog has brought a parcel and dropped here. A parcel? Bring it inside. Take it, mam. Name – Malliga. Inspector murder evidence. Rambo knife! Knife? Didn’t I tell you? This is the original Rambo knife which killed the Inspector. How is it here? Mam, some finger print report is here. Malliga! This is Malliga's finger print. That's a suicide case. It's perplexing. How is her fingerprint possible on this knife? Who would've sent this? Hello, Murthy sir. The original knife that was used to kill the Inspector was sent... ... with a dog to the station by someone. A dog? -Yes, sir. A fingerprint report has also came along. Then? On that knife, the fingerprint of the woman... ...who died falling from Kovalam bridge is there. A knife and fingerprint? -Yes, sir. Not only that, even the CCTV footage of Ramar is with mam. You take care, sir. Okay, you leave it. I'll take care. (Indistinct voices) Sir, don't you think what are you doing? Already, it's a problem. I had great suspicion over him in the Inspector's murder case. I tried to figure out who is behind him. But, you made it impossible. Mam, he had the knife on sir's neck. The public was around. Feared some other problem would happen... Isn't this a big problem now? Who will answer the higher officials and human rights, sir? Mam, we shouldn't think everything like public. We are the police. Instead of dying in the police station, he died outside. Be happy with that. The thing is, I didn't get my promotion. That's over. You speak well, Murthy sir. Please, go out. Don't frustrate me. This is not the knife used to murder the inspector. You need promotion too? Hey! In police training, haven't you been taught where to shoot? As you all think, the inspector wasn't killed by Ramar. On the day when the Inspector died, Malliga was there. I saw her bicycle there. I confirmed it at her place whether it was her bicycle or not. The Inspector died at 1 o'clock. In next hour, she was found dead on the bridge near the Inspector's house. She doesn't have money problem to commit suicide. If anyone thinks to escape from this case, I'll not leave. But, mam... Ramar is dead. What are you going to do then? What if he dies, Murthy? I'm going to start this case from Malliga. Hey, did you enquire the address of the party member... ...where that woman was working? Don't know, mam. -I'm enquiring. Why should we enquire it there? It'll be known if we ask Vasanth. How does he know? Vasanth is going to marry his daughter. He is waiting for the promotion. As soon as he gets promotion, he will get married. Am I right, Vasanth? Oh, is it? Immediately, send me the contact number of that party member and that girl. Okay? -Okay, mam. Take the vehicle. Meena. Yes, mam. -Be seated. Okay, I'll come straight away to the matter. How do you know Malliga? Malliga sister resides in my neighborhood slum. She is working in my house for past few months. She is good. I think her husband is troublesome. Her children are good. Okay, when did you see her last? Lastly... She came home yesterday afternoon. She asked money since there is an important event in her house. I didn't have money. But she didn't leave me. She compelled me for the money. I too gave the money which I kept here and there in home. Then she left. That's when I saw her last. Else, no other link between us, mam. You must come again if called for enquiry. Okay? Okay, mam. I'll come. Mam. The lab report has come. What's given in the report? We got an important clue, mam. Someone else's blood stain is on the knife. What? Is there someone else's blood? Yes, mam. What are you saying, Kumar? The blood in the Rambo side is the Inspector's and on the other side... ...is the rare blood group 'O negative', as given by the lab report. Different blood groups on two sides. The other blood group! After murdering the Inspector, they have murdered someone else. Yes, mam. Kumar, I want the blood report of Ramar's brother, his aides... ...and all the familiar people to the Inspector. Call Murthy to the police station. We have to enquire him. Okay, mam. Murthy sir, what's the link between you and Ramar? Mam, will you please sit and talk? My neck is hurting. It's said that Ramar and yourself are close, is it true? Mam, it's common for the police and some prisoners to be close. Don't blow up, unnecessarily. It's also very common for some cops to steal befriending the thieves, isn't it? The way you speak is wrong, mam. It seems, you intendly speak to blame me. I have nothing to do with Ramar. I have heard at the station that there are many cases on Ramar. What's the use of getting him with lot of effort? You're ashaming me before the people who are less in service than me. Isn't it you who arrested Ramar on the spot? The knife he had was duplicate. On the original knife, the slum woman Malliga's fingerprint was there. How is it possible? If you ask me? We need to find it all together. Finding out is the job of the cop. It's not to question another cop. SI should work in the checkpost till 4 o'clock. How did you go there? I did my duty as a cop. Going rounds is the duty of a SI. That's when I saw him coming out of the Inspector's bungalow. And I held him. But, now... For me, it looks like you would've told him to go upstairs and stab him... ...and you were waiting down with the gun. You... I cannot be responsible for everything which comes to your mind, mam. The law needs witness and evidence. You look me with wrong mind. Hey! Murthy, why are you afraid? I want to see whether the blood on the knife is consistent with your blood? That's all. You go ahead. It's you who said that law needs evidence. That's why, don't be afraid. Hello! Hello, where are you? Near ECR. Come to the godown next to Neelangarai at ECR. Why? I need to speak. Come. Hey, SI Murthy is coming. Send two of our guys behind the godown. Tell them to call after Murthy leaves. Why does he come here now? Inspector called me for an enquiry. Don't be afraid. Definitely, I'll not betray anyone. First, she enquired me. Then, she will enquire you definitely since you're close to me. If we both discuss where did this problem emerged... ...without hiding anything, it's good for both of us. All the problems emerged at this tea shop. (Indistinct voices) Yes, sir! I'll come, sir. -Give me two bajjis. I got it, sir. -Serve it hot. I got it from them too, sir. The SP sir called. He is asking me to be at the check post till 4 am. Else, I'd have finished it then, sir. Sir. Hey, keep this on charge. Give me your phone. My phone? Take it. -Give me. (Indistinct voices) Where is the charger? Okay. Hey, it's not getting charged. What phone he has. It's not getting charged. Will you even do tik tok like this? You traitors. You're caught, Vasanth. Musical line from the film ”Oomai vizhigal” Let me see. Sir! Sir! Hi! -Come, let's eat. Take it. Why didn't you eat? I'm not feeling good, sir. Why? What happened? My father-in-law has gone out to look for a bridegroom, sir. Hey, you're yet to get married with her. Has he became your father-in-law so soon? Sir, you be quiet. Okay, what are you going to do? Sir, today I went to my fiancee's house when no one was there. I even set the camera. If I do something mischievous and show that video to my father-in-law... He has to get his daughter married to me. Somehow, I managed her to take to bedroom. Some romantic things has happened. -I know. Then, you know... Nothing will happen to me. Damn it. You're a wastrel. Though that girl agrees, you will step back. Sir, did you speak about the promotion? No. He has given me another work. -What's that? His wife is coming tomorrow. He needs to clean the house and told to send the guys from the station. No one is at the police station. Shall we go to the slum and get the guys? Though that girl agrees, you will step back. Yesterday, he was shouting to bring biryani soon. Am I a supplier to him? We are wearing the police garb, right? You've to do more than this. Do you want promotion or not? I want, sir. Then, bring the phone on charge. It's a phone and need to charge too? (Indistinct voices) Hey who is this. Pour some water. Sir! (Indistinct voices) It's been two years since they were imprisoned in Puzhal. You told me to bring them. Oh, no! What to do now? What if you ask me? Okay, we will get someone. Let's take two people. Come on. Let's go and see there. (Indistinct voices) Hey, it's the fragrance of biryani. When in hunger, even sambar rice seems like biryani. Yes, sir. We didn't even have snacks at tea shop. Come, let's eat. Two chairs are there for us. Sir, what's this? It seems awkward to sit here with uniform. Don't I get hungry if I wear uniform? (Indistinct voices) Serve a leaf. It'll be a shame if people see us. Nothing like that. Keep a smiling face and eat. (Indistinct voices) The food isn't good. That's what I said, earlier. You stay back and eat well. -Okay, I'll eat. The sambar rice tastes good. Where is the wash area? -It's there. Okay. -Hey! Take that paper. Thank you. Hey, is it you working in the party cadre's house? The people in the house you stole wants you to imprison. You look pity. You go and bring the jewelry. Let's finish everything. Can you steal at your workplace? Go. Go and bring it. Hey! Hey, it seems with that jewelry, you had arranged this feast. You don't worry. Nowadays, the murder, theft and rape are not at all incidents. There is a saying, 'may hospitality be requited by treachery?' Let's do one thing. You finish all your works and go to ECR bungalow. The Inspector will be there. Tell him, "Inspector sir, please apologize me. I'll not do this mistake again". He will tell you one or two jobs. Do that and get adjusted to him. Do you know what's that adjustment mean, right? How couldn't you know? You're leading a life with a drunkard, that too alone. That's the same adjustment. If you try to do anything, I'll make a call and bring the jeep. I'll hit and drag you like a dog before these people and imprison you. Do you know how will these people treat you... ...if you go to prison once? You've children too. Think well and do good. If you need money also, he will give. I'm a cruel person. If you try to do anything, I'll treat you worst. Our guy is here. He will escort you safely. You're going, right? You've to go. Video evidence is here. Hey, just a little. Just a little. That's enough. The people in the house you stole wants you to imprison. I'll hit and drag you like a dog before these people and imprison you. Come soon, sister. It might get dawn. Come. Let's go. Finish the job soon. The inspector will assign this kind of job now and then. I'll take you, hereafter. If you need money, ask him. it's not wrong. He will give generously. Come. Sir! He is here. Sir! I brought a person to work. Tell her to go inside and do. -You go inside and clean up. Sir, shall I go with her and clean? You go and clean the vehicle. He has come to clean along. Go. Wonder, who gave you the job? Go. -Okay sir. It's the same one who gave you the job, you wastrel. If I get posting soon... ...I'll not ask my assistants to serve me. Damn it. You dare to tell me to clean the vehicle. I'll clean my vehicle. My fiancée will be sleeping. Why am I feeling very sleepy today? What's that sound? Oh, no! What happened? Everything has fallen down. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sister! Who is calling at this time? Vasanth. Hello! Sir, come fast to this bungalow. Sir, please. Sir, come soon please. Sir, come soon. Sir... Hello! Sir... Sir, please come soon. I'm coming. Sir! Sir, I brought her here as you said. Sir told me to wait outside. I was sitting in the vehicle and slept. Suddenly, I heard a sound and came. This has happened, sir. I don't understand anything, sir. Did anyone saw you when you bring her from slum? I don't know, sir. Why did you ask to bring her here, sir? That's unnecessary for you. Everything is for our goodness. At the time of getting promotion, this has happened... I think, she had killed him before he touched her. We can use this too for our promotion, you know? It's the problem for us, if it gets delayed. Sir, for us? I'm not related to it in any way. My name is in the promotion list. I'm going to get married, Sir. Please, leave me sir. Don't involve me in this, sir. Please, sir. I plead you. I'll not tell anything to anyone. Please, sir. Leave me, sir. Coward. He needs promotion. Who is calling at this time? Murthy sir, tell me. Ramar, where are you? -At Adyar godown, sir. A crime has happened on favour of us. Inspector has been killed. What are you saying, sir? Who killed him, sir? You come immediately to the Inspector's bungalow at ECR. I'm coming, sir. If that woman asks anything about Ramar and Malliga... ...say her that you don't know. I'll take care of the rest. Where is the video? -Which one? The video you took from my phone without my knowledge. That video. If I give that video to you, what should I do? Hey, not only stealing the stud is in the video, even my personal is there. Vasanth, if someone has to fear us, his weakness should be in our hands. Until you be silent, that video will be safe with me. If you think of doing anything, everyone will watch that video. You're going to feel sorry for this incident. Hey, you people want to live happily. so, you will fear for anything. I think, why I was born. I'll not care about anything. If you try to take advantage since Murthy has told everything... Shall I leave? Hope you understood. Hey, dude. SI Murthy has left. Come, let's see. It's him. Kill him. Do you know the place where Malliga's corpse was found? Yes, I know mam. 30 minutes is the issue. Who are you? Sir, I'm Malliga's daughter Akila. What are you doing here? I need to talk an important matter to you. About the missing of my mother. Be seated. Tell me. Sir, after you left on that night. The person who came with you took my mother and went somewhere. Okay. I saw them, sir. -Did you see? I too went behind them, sir. What? Did you go behind them? Yes, sir. He took my mother alone, too far. I followed them without their knowledge. He left my mother in a bungalow and he came out alone. He saw me then, sir. Then? Sir, she is her daughter. She came behind us running. I don't want her to stay out at this time. That's why, I brought her inside. What to do, sir? Her mother will finish off the work and come. Until then, ask her to watch TV. -Okay, sir. Come. I'll take you both after the work gets over. Watch TV. Mom! Akila! Mom! Akila! Hey, leave her. You run away. Leave her. Mom! Akila! Leave her. Mom! Akila! Mom! Akila! Leave her. Hey, leave her. Akila! Mom! -Leave her. Leave her. -Mom! Akila! Mom! Leave her. Leave me. Hey! Mom! Leave me. Hey, leave her. Mom! Then? When I regained conscious, the person who came with you... ...was dragging me somewhere. Hey! You... Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir! Sir! Hey, girl! Give me the knife. Hey! Hey! Hey, stop. Damn it. What happened later? Tell me. Tell me. He was searching me furiously, sir. I escaped and ran away, not knowing to him. Damn it. Murthy... Was he thinking? What was he thinking? Don't you know why this woman was brought here? Murthy brought her here for sake of his promotion. Be careful, Vasanth. Murthy sir may grab your promotion it seems. You get some big case. lse, make the people at station to believe that you've got a case. Already, Vasanth's name is being recommended for it. There is not even a small black mark on him. Take care. We are wearing police garbs, right? You've to do more than this. She said she will come for a thousand or two. You said it's a struggling family. So, what you do is take her with you. Hey, you're just a police constable. What will you think more criminal than me? Murthy, being friendly with me, you betrayed me, isn't it? Hello, sir! Come to the bungalow, sir. Please, sir. Come, sir. Sir. What? Think well and say. On that day, the knife you used to stab the Inspector, ...did you come out and gave it to anyone? I dropped the knife there and came running, sir. Think well and reply me. I remember well, sir. I dropped the knife there and came running, sir. Vasanth, you sent the knife to the police station... ...and made a scene to me. Vasanth, where are you? Here, in the tea shop, sir. What's the matter? Be there. I’ll come. Okay, come. I captured the footage where Murthy is taking the corpse at toll plaza, sir. I'll get the report in a while that the blood on the Rambo knife is Murthy's. With your permission, I have to arrest Murthy, sir. Go ahead. Watch out for the media. Thank you, sir. (Indistinct voices) What Vasanth? You're often coming to have tea. What to do, sir? Everything is what you taught me. I think you are in deep thinking. It's visible on your face. Shall I tell you a truth? I too know to think on my own, sir. I don't want your advice. I know all your own thinking. What do you know? On that night, at the bungalow, did you wait outside? Else, you left to house and came back? What? Tell me, dude. -I was there only. Hey, if two policemen think alike at the same time... ...then, it will end up in a big problem. Have you done that knowingly? Have you too done it knowingly? Intelligence and surviving tactics, all these things seems to be criminal for the loser. We can't do anything. You tried to trap me, right? Why did you hide from me that Mallika's daughter came there? Why didn't you say me about Malliga's issue, sir? It's not necessary that I've to tell you everything, Vasanth. There will be many reasons if I hide a matter from you. You've joined as a cop, recently. But, I'm experienced. All these problems occured since you changed the knife. What? Did I change the knife? Either you or the woman Inspector cannot trap me in any of the issue. If Murthy does a matter, it'll be done, clearly. Sir, I know well what's your clarity. You made me a scapegoat to Ramar's brother... ...as it's me who knew the details of the Inspector's murder? That's it, right? The gun was with you until you went to the hospital. You left the gun wantedly in the vehicle, when you went to bring Ramar. You gave an idea to Ramar to remove the handcuff and flee. You made me to shoot Ramar and I must die in the hands of his brother. That's what your plan is, right? Whatever you said is right. It's me who told Ramar to escape. It's me who removed his handcuff. It's me who told you to shoot at the fish tank... ...and pushed Ramar in that. It's me who made you to kill Ramar. Ramar must die on that day. Else, I'd have been caught. Why all those? It's me who shot dead the slum woman, Malliga. I took her to the bridge from the bungalow. As you all think, she didn't die in the bungalow. Being a policeman, can't you even check that properly? It's dangerous if she is alive. So, I hit her to death. It's me who thrown her from the bridge... ...and made it as suicide. That's for my safety. That little girl is with me now. I've recorded everything she said. It's you who took her mother from the slum. That girl stabbed you. It's your blood on the knife. According to this case, you're the No.1 accused. Why are you panicking? Vasanth, shall I advice you now? Sir...sir... Sorry, sir. I did by mistake, sir. Sir, I did by mistake. Sorry, sir. I've to get promotion, sir. Please, sir. My marriage is to be fixed, sir. I'll fall on your foot, sir. Sorry, sir. Please leave me this time, sir. You escaped from the bungalow on that day. It's dangerous if I leave you still. I'll show you who this Murthy is. -Sir! Please, sir! -You damn it. Sir. Go and get me a cigarette. Go. You'll be spared. If that girl says to anyone like she told me... ...you'd have been imprisoned. Kings light. Look at him. Go. He is planning to pull me. (Indistinct voices) Cigarette. (Indistinct voices) I must know who is the reason for my brother's death. Leave me. I'll get all the truth from Murthy. Then, you decide who should you kill. (Indistinct voices) Hey! (Indistinct voices) (Indistinct voices) Hey! Hey, you...being friendly with my brother, how dare you killed him? Lynch him. Vasanth, tell him. You will say to think like a cop. -Don't leave him. Run away. I'm also a cop! (Indistinct voices) Joker! Vasanth! Vasanth, save me. (Indistinct voices) Mam. Kumar, the moment I thought almost I got him... ...He was lynched, at last. Ramar's brothers are big hooligans, mam. This problem will not end here. As we think, the blood on the knife is not that of Murthy sir's. Yes, mam. Just now the report has come. Have a look at it, mam. Where did he keep the phone? My video. Have you seen this girl anywhere? This is Malliga's daughter. Her house is in the 3rd Street. You can go there and enquire. Who are you, sir? Known to them. Are you their well-wisher? Pity on her. She fell somewhere and died. Oh, is it? My husband went to the death. They left to their grand father's house. Someone comes and enquires. Don't understand anything. Have you seen Malliga sister's daughter, who resides in the next street? Her mother died and she left to grandfather's house. Yeah, who are you? - Known to them. He is a retired police. He will give training to the dogs. The oldey is bringing up that dog. There is an old housing quarters. He is working there as watchman. If you go in the night, you can meet him. Hey, Vasanth! Hey! What's this lunatic doing here? Vasanth, why are you here? I came for enquiry. Do you know, Murthy sir was trapped totally. Meanwhile, Ramar's brothers had killed Murthy. That's why, mam has started the case from the dog. It seems that dog comes here, often. Enquiry is going on there. Did you get anything on your enquiry? Why did she come here? Mam called you to enquire. Didn't you go? Vasanth, did she call me too? -Yes. Myself? -Yes, it's you. I'm coming. Lunatic. 'He is a detective' 'He is the driver, Saravanan' 'He is a detective...' Evidence! Who will bring that dog here? Yes, mam. An old man who helps Malliga. But don't know where will he be now. Enquire in the neighborhood, mam. Anbu, this is the last evidence the police is searching for. If Joe hands over it perfectly, all our problems will be solved. Vasanth's dress and his blood group report is here. Vasanth's blood stained T-shirt is here. Everything is here. If we give everything to the police, he can't escape. Okay, grandpa. He has come, grandpa. Hey, run away. How did he come here? -Come grandpa, let's run away. Close the door. Anbu, run away. Don't stop. Go fast. Go. Hey, stop. Listen to me. Don't get caught to him. Hey... Hey... Hey, stop. Hey... Hey... Hey, listen to what I say. Hey... Hey... Hey, stop. The phone! The T-shirt. Hey! Where is that phone? Where is my attire? Got fooled? This is how you cheated my mother, isn't it? I didn't cheat anyone, you crazy. It's you who cheated and took her and killed. It's you who made the police to believe that she committed suicide. It's you who killed my mother and came along with me.... ...and asked whether it's my mother. Last night, my sister escaped from you and came home. A knife in her hand. Blood stains on her. She told us everything. That's why, we decided on that day... We shouldn't leave you, who shattered a good family. We must do something, grandpa. When I came to the police station in the morning, I had the knife which you were searching. I overheard everything you spoke in the station. I saw everything on the table when giving the complaint letter. Did you think, I came along with you and cried hugging my mother? Only then, I took the finger print of my mother on the knife. Hey boy, shall we go? We couldn't keep my mother's corpse even for sometime at our house. We took her to the graveyard immediately. we sent the knife to the station. Thinking that you'll get caught. But, you cheated everyone and escaped. Even now, do you think I came running feared that you will kill me? We must kill you at this place. That's our plan. You've only 30 seconds. In the dictionary of the police, if two thieves are running, They will catch the first thief and hit him... ...and will make the second thief to come back. But, it's a human dictionary. This world is round. This path is a circle. Now, tell me. Who should I catch first? You can't understand, right? Only five seconds time for you. Mom! Mom! Mom! He is the one who killed your mother. You all have mistaken me. That's how, the incidents has occurred. I'm not responsible for your mother's death. But, It's SI Murthy. He escaped and he made me get caught without my knowledge. It's me who saved you on that day. The inspector killed your mother and was searching for the gun to kill you too. At that moment, I only dragged you and tried to save you. You've mistaken me and stabbed me. When I handed over the corpse of your mother in your home, I thought of telling you and make you to understand. Only then, I knew there are no responsible persons in the house except your mother. I couldn't find you in one day with your photo. Even after I told you all these... ...and If you want to do this mistake, go ahead. Since Murthy is designated as SI he killed their mother. You hid that, as you're the PC. Nothing difference between you both. But one thing, in this police department, no one knows who is good and who is bad. We came here to kill those who ruined our family. To kill an innocent, we aren't the cops. Come, let's go. Come, dear. I'll fulfill your mother's dream. You don't worry for anything. It's dangerous if she is alive. So, I hit her to death. He is a worst person, mam. I know, sir. This is how the do something. Then, the press and the public throw all the blame on us. Yes...yes... Mam, if you've followed this dog from the beginning, You'd have finished this case long back. You've come now, so you go ahead. What? You are asking me to catch the dog? I'll not touch any case for two years. I shouldn't get black mark from anyone. Getting a post to this station... Hi! Come. -Sir. Tell me. -Sir, he is Vasanth. Oh... The order is for him. Is it? Let us give him, together. Okay, sir. All the best. All the best. Thank you sir. Biryani for all, today evening. Sure, sir. Okay. -Okay. Nowadays, the posting is rejected even for a small black mark. Isn't him who jumped into the sea and saved the children? Isn't him? -Yes. In this society, the things that we need to get in right way, The opportunities and circumstances make us guilty and creates... ...an environment to struggle and get it. A good guy got the promotion. Murthy turned many people into dice for his needs. But I... I used Murthy as a dice for my need. Yeah, as that old man said... ...there is nothing difference between me and Murthy. More than the people who protects law, order and integrity, There are people who take the same law and order in their hands... ...and misusing it are around us. I couldn't rely on some little integrity and go behind it. It seemed to me that it was wise to escape from the mistakes... ...and go ahead of it. I've never learned a good lesson from this society. Instead, I learnt to lie. But until the end, it was not known whose blood type... ...was in the other end of the knife.
