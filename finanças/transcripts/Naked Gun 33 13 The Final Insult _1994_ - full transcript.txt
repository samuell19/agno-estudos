(CLOCK CHIMING) (BABY CRYING) WOMAN: Hey, look! It's the President! And the Pope! Yee-aah! Yah! Ooh-la-la-la-la-la! MAN: Oh, my God! Look! It's disgruntled postal workers! (CLICK) Wait a minute! Give me my baby back! Aah! Aah! - Frank! Are you all right? - I'm soaking wet. - I'll get the talcum powder. - No, I had a nightmare. There was crime all around me. I couldn't stop it. - It was just a dream. - You're right. All I need is a good rest. In the morning everything'll be fine. (DOGS WHINE) How's my little boy? Getting along okay, sweetie? As well as a heterosexual can in prison. I don't know how much longer I can take it. - How's Tanya? - Tanya's the same. Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into. Ma! I'll get guy cramps! Sorry. Rocco, there's somebody here to see you. Papshmir. My people are very upset. They're always upset. They're Arab terrorists. Ma, please. You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world. Stations, stores, government buildings... The devastation in Florida. - That was Hurricane Andrew. - That's what they told the public. We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes. A first-class job costs 5 million. If you want to step up to the price, I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed. That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different? $5 million buys me. - I'm breaking out of here. - All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving. Fail? Show me one man who can stop me. I used to be a renegade I used to fool around But I couldn't take the punishment I had to settle down Now I'm playing it reaI straight And yes, I cut my hair... PA: Attention shoppers. Be sure to check out our speciaI on aisle 7. It's hip to be square... PA: That's aisle 7. Hey! Give it to me! LADY: My purse! Somebody help me! THIEF: I want the purse, lady. LADY: Help me! He's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny Hear! Hear! Well, we shot a lot of people together. It's been great. But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home. Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party. Well, Ed. - I officially give you my gun. - Aw... And my badge. (WHIMPERS) And... Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir. - Oh, gee... - Cheer up, Ed. This is not goodbye. It's just I won't ever see you again. Oh, Frank. LADY: My purse! Somebody help me! THIEF: Out of the way. Lieutenant Drebin! Frank! Didn't you see that? What? Oh, yes. Kitty litter. Two bags for a dollar. Great. Order. The jury will disregard that statement. Continue, Counsellor. Alimony had been set by the court. Right, Mr Clayton? Yes, but... But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order. I lost her address. She moved twice, I couldn't keep up. Don't lie to me. You're under oath. Do you know the penalty for perjury? (BABIES CRYING) I'll ask that again. Objection! Your Honour, I... ow, ow. Jeez! - Counsel is leading the witness. - Sustained. (GAVEL POUNDS) Sweetie, Mommy said no pounding when she's in session. Please read the prosecution's last statement. "Don't lie to me. You're under oath. " - (BURP) - There. "Do you know the penalty for perjury?" That's all I have, Your Honour. You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin. Er... prosecution rests. Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo? No further questions, Your Honour. Court will recess until after the morning feed. (SQUEAK) We're gonna win this. I can feel it. Yes. Of course. I married the wrong man. I never thought that was possible. - I beg your pardon? - Oh, nothing. Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man. You just have to work at it. Now, let's see. Mr and Mrs Drebin, right? Now, you two have been married for six months? Yes. We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor. You were recommended by our last therapist. Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide. You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame. Now, which one of you is impotent? - That would be him. - Yes, of course. - Why don't you ask who's frigid? - That would be him, also. - How do you know? You're never home. - He resents that I work. He has no idea what a woman wants. You're so insensitive. - Is this the toilet seat thing? - It's babies, Frank. I want to have a baby. Whenever we make love, you get a headache. I'm not a piece of meat, Jane. I'm trying. I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate. - Frank! - Maybe it's your fault. Have you tried sexy lingerie? Some lacy underwear, a black teddy? I've worn them all. They don't work. Oh. Why don't you want a child? Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl? Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest. Make tonight a special night. Dinner, wine, romantic music. Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station. Just be Jane and Frank, lovers. We haven't had a night like that in a long time. - Not together. - Frank? Jane... Having a baby is a big responsibility. It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail. I'm just frightened. Frank, let's make tonight something special. Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much. My little lover sparrow. My puppy-wuppy wover. My little love biscuit. My little shnooky-wookums. My little lady cheesy puppy. Mr and Mrs Drebin, please. I'm diabetic. I think you should go now. I never thought we'd end this way. How did you think we'd end? I don't know. Some other way. Oh, Jason. (CRYING) (DOORBELL) Ed! Nordberg! It's been a long time. Hiya, Frank! You look terrific! Thank you. The little woman got me a Thighmaster. Where are my manners? Come on in. How charming! Sit, sit. Excuse the mess. It's my ironing day. I just frosted some cupcakes. - Would you care for one? - Oh, not just now. Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat. - Police Squad is certain... - I'd love a cupcake. - That coffee smells great. - I grind my own beans. Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help. It's great! I hoped you'd like them. Made them from scratch. I'll just get off my feet. We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt. These were taken by a news photographer. - This girl was the diversion. - We had them enlarged. They look familiar. No, the pin, she's a nurse. Can I keep this one? We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood. - She's Tanya Peters. - Tanya Peters? - You know her? - Don't you remember in the 1970s? The big disco shoot-out. (STAYIN'ALIVE PLAYING) Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk The music loud, the women warm I've been kicked around since I was born But it's all right, I'm OK You may look the other way We can try to understand... Ed, what's happening, my man? Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party. I went to see the Village People. They're a stone soul gas, man. - I can dig it. - What have we got here? One dead disco dancer. Bummer. What a mindbender, huh? We think it was a love triangle. This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters. Cigarette? Yes, I know. Well, we'll need a statement from you down at the station. Nordberg! Coming, Lieutenant! I do remember. You were one of the first test cases for minoxidil, weren't you? - What? - I'm glad I could help. Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven. We need a favour. It's not that big a roast, Nordberg. No, not that, Frank. We need you to go undercover at the clinic. Whoa! I've given up police work, Ed. You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods. - We're in a bind, Frank. - What about Hedges and O'Malley? They're in Hawaii. Together. Well, I can't. Jane and I have a special evening planned. You'll be home in time to make dinner. I'd have to make pork chops. Frank, think of all the crime out there. Nobody is safe. You'd be protecting Jane. You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world. And you haven't shot anybody in months. That's true. Funny how you miss the little things. Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again. The thrill of the chase, to be a man. After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic. It's always important to have a disguise and this operation was no different. I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses and combed my hair differently. The plan was to get in, get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible. I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick. - Can I help you? - I'd like to see a doctor, please. Sign in here, please. - Do you have an appointment, Mr... - Er, Smith. No, I don't. Take a number. Six. - What? - Is six taken? Does it have to be between 1 and 10? You'll be called. Thank you. Mr Smith? We've had a cancellation. We can take you now. Good morning, Mr Smith. This way. I really appreciate your seeing me like this. I'm sure it won't take too long. When did you notice the problem? Uh, in the back yard with my uncle. In the back yard with your uncle? Yes. When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while. What did you and your uncle find out? I can't keep up with him. Mine hurt, especially on the long ones. I can't seem to straighten it out. It has no feeling. It's kind of numb. I may have yanked it too much. - If you would. - For what? - A sperm count. - In here? It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do. Well... (ZIP) (SHOUTING AND YELPING) (GLASS BREAKING) (ZIP) Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork. Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse. - This way, please. - What? - Number 17. - Oh, no. - A problem? - No, no. - This is 17. - Have we met before? If you'll excuse me, I'm next. Ooh! Aah! Agh! Eurgh! - Sir? - Aah! Mr Smith, how are we doing? (SHEEP BLEATS) I've been busy. - Do you want a videotape to help? - Do you have Dances With Wolves? Rocketeer? Lady And The Tramp? An adult movie. Hmm... Ooh! Aah! Yeow! The tape was very entertaining. Follow me. Do you have Spartacus? PA: Maintenance. Clean-up, room 7. Maintenance. Clean-up, room 7. Stat. - What are you doing? - Just freshening up. You should look your best even though you're by yourself. Are you sure we've never met? Here's my cup. Back to work. - Knocking. - Mr Smith? - Are you okay in there? - I could use a little help. PA: Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please. Dr Rosenblatt. (ROMANTIC MUSIC) Honey, I've been waiting all day. I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon. Tonight's going to be special. I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours. Wouldn't Mr Happy like that? - Hours? - Like our first time together. Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days? Possibly a week. You're so cute. Let me go get the oysters and clams. Walk my way And a thousand violins Begin to play Or it might be the sound Of your hello That music I hear I get misty The moment you're near You can say That you're leading me on... Here. I'll shave your back like last time. Jane, I really don't think we should. I... Frank! What's this? I fell on a rake. You're lying. Now I know why Ed's been calling. - You're back on a case, aren't you? - No, I swear. It's another woman! In your wildest dreams! It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male! Jane! Ah! Jane! It was nothing, Jane. I was doing Ed a small favour! Some retirement. I'm leaving, Frank. I never thought you'd go back on your word. - Aren't you being hasty? - I don't think so. - (DOORBELL) - That's my cab. I'll be at Louise's. Oh, Frank, how could you? We need time apart to think about us. I'm not going to think. Why start now? I love you. Look, baby, I am what I am and I do what I do. A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals. - I'm a cop. - Pretty speech, Frank. But my mind is made up. I'm leaving. All right. Then take this with you. You know how my lips feel about things. (DOORBELL) Goodbye, Frank. RADIO:You're listening to KSAD, all-depressing, all the time. Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, who just called from a taxi. "Frank, you Iying weaseI-weenie. "First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out... " He said he'd never go back to police work. Once a cop, always a cop. - He's married to his work. - You'll always come in second. There was an article in Cosmo, "Why all men are pigs". "Frank" is just another word for loser. I never want to see him again. I want to get as far away as possible. We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant. The fresh air will do you good. Go easy. That's your second bottle of Chanel. You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin. No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man. I'm out for the new me. Let's burn rubber. - Didn't forget anything, did you? - I hope not. Just calm down, ma'am. How many bodies did you find in your pool? Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine. Just mail it in. Frank! Glad you could make it! - Welcome, buddy. - Nordberg. Did you find Tanya's address, Frank? I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it. - I'm getting a bit rusty. - It could happen to anybody. I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge! You go on about your business. I'll stay out of your hair. It'll be... Frank, let me take that. We've got a surprise for you. It's in honour of your 30 years on the force. Nordberg. Oh, boy. This is really great. Thank you, guys. We thought it might cheer you up. We heard about you and Jane. Jane, Jane. That name will always remind me of her. Frank, I feel really bad about all of this. If there's anything you need. Dr Kevorkian's home phone number? Nordberg, put it together. - Frank, you know we're here for you. - Thanks, Ed. Well, look who's here. Hi, Frank. Nice to see you. - I've got that data on the bomb. - What did you find out? The explosive is a very fine powder. - It tastes like... - That's fertiliser. Another case. This is what I'm talking about. We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine. - Can you tell us where it came from? - I'd be glad to. Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass... Ted, I'm talking about the powder. We don't know about that. Let me take that urine specimen. We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene. On a hunch, we analysed the paper. - And you got something? - Yes. The paper's from Statesville Prison. - Are you sure? - Positive. We analysed the wood fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary Island pine, which grows only in Oregon. Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma. Unfortunately, the trail ended there. - How'd you trace it to the prison? - Right here on the letterhead. After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect. Rocco Dillon. He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison. There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next. We have to send someone in there. - I'll do it. - I wouldn't feel right about that. If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead. "You might end up dead" is my middle name. What about Jane? I don't know her middle name. I need the action. I'm going inside the big house. Frank, Ed. I think you might want to see this. We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device. We'll see how it works. Get out! Don't make me... Argh! We call it the Denver jockstrap. After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action. Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison. I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers. It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game. It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here. (BELL) After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination, Maximum Security, home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country. And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon. GUARD: All right, in here. Ain't no prison yet could hold me. Attica! Attica! Power to the brothers! Kill whitey! Kill whitey! PRISONER: Knock it off! You're chirping loud for a new canary. Keep flashing the big eyes and I'll rotate your jaw. Hey! You know who you talking to? The man is Rocco Dillon. - Where's your prison number? - It's unlisted. Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk. Look, I'm the muscle in this pen. Just stay out of my way. You just watch your step, McGirk. Take it from me, this place changes a man. Yeah? How? I used to be white. I was the drummer for the Osmonds. Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before. I know. I remember the Osmonds. (BELL) - Better hit the rack, McGirk. - In a minute. First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days. GUARD: Lights out. Lockdown in two minutes. My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns, I miss you so much. I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped. I remember it well. Her name was Gabriella. We were supposed to be married, but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up. I was heartbroken. I figured she had fallen for another man, someone who could do to her what I never could. I thought my life was over untiI that one glorious day. That was the day you became my wife. Our friends gathered to celebrate our love. It seems like only yesterday. We were all so overjoyed. I remember wishing we could take everyone with us. That was the happiest day of my life. I remember the plans we made. Things were going to be so perfect. We got that housekeeper you always wanted. Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D. And I knew that eventually our dream would come true. One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr. ROCCO: Shut up. I'm trying to get some sleep. Nah, it's no use. She'll never come back. (GROWLS LIKE A LION) You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain Too much love drives a man insane You broke my will, but what a thrill Goodness gracious, great balls of fire! I laughed at love cos I thought it was funny You came along and moved me, honey I changed my mind, this love is fine Goodness gracious, great balls of fire! Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover? No problem. Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was well-endowed with courage. Now I had to get on the inside. Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feeI things out. (WHISPERS) Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here. Just you and me. - Burnett wants in. - Burnett's one of the guards! I know, but he's unhappy here. All right, all right. Whatever. Got it all worked out right here. What's this? Another letter from your mommy? - That's private! - Let's see what we have. - Give the man back his letter. - Buzz off, butter cheeks. What's so special about a little letter? Wait a minute. An escape plan! This is your ticket to another 20 years, Dillon. If the warden gets one look at this... Hey! You call this slop? Real slop has got chunks in it! This is more like gruel! And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled! This is room temperature! What do you think we are, animals? ALL: No! What are we? Homo sapiens? You're right! We are men! We are men! ALL: We are men! We are men! We are men! We are men! Left hand blue. Whose hand is that? Come on, son. You can do it. Eat some beans! (CLANG) You saved my bacon, McGirk. I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that. I've been watching you. You handle yourself good. - "Really well". - Whatever. I got something big on the outside. I could use you in my gang. - Dental plan? - Full coverage. - What's the caper? - First we bust out. Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan. Let's have it. - It's a good plan. - I've had better. Listen, I've got a fool-proof plan. They got Tyrone. Can't... Can't we all just get along? Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco. He had to trust me. 'Shh! Hold on. (WHISPERING) Okay. I convinced Rocco to dig a tunneI. It was that or go out in a laundry truck. The thought of Iying nose down in skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early in the construction. Apart from some chafing, we made good progress. We kept digging. Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell. GUARD: Lights out. There was more dirt than I thought. Disposing of it was becoming tricky. Safe! Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall If one of those bottles should happen to fall Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall... Where are you going? - Are you thinking of Frank again? - They're playing our song. I understand. Take your time. - Hello there. - Excuse me. I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me? No. - How about a kiss? - No. When a woman says no, she means yes. - How about that kiss? - Yes. No? I know your type. Come on, baby. We're two of a kind. Oh, my God! You killed him! It was an accident. Call the police. Come to your senses. You killed a man. You're a hero to every woman. We have to call Frank. He'll protect us. Frank is a man. He'll see you locked away forever. Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible. Yipes! Louise, do what you have to do. I'm calling Frank. TRUCKER: Oh, boy, did that hurt. Be home, Frank. Answer the phone. - (TELEPHONE PICKS UP) - Frank! ANSWERPHONE: Hi, this is Frank. And Jane. BOTH: We're the Drebins. We're not home right now so leave a message! FRANK: Which button is it? JANE: Not that one! (DIAL TONE) "Tanya"? It was another woman. Frank wasn't lying. "Honeymoon Bay Road. " I bet they're alone there now! Frank! Cell inspection. There's been a rumour of a possible breakout. If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely. Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel. The last few feet were dug on the run. Another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls. May he rest in peace, in the arms of our... Jesus Christ! ALL: Amen. FRANK: Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us. After making a slight adjustment we arrived at the rendezvous point, a Los Angeles city high schooI. Hey, that was close. Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag? She take one in the face? She's my mother. Mrs Dillon. Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal. - You must be proud of him. - I am. I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" McGirk. There's fresh clothes in the back. Rocco's mom was quiet. I felt she didn't care for me coming along. Like a midget at a urinaI, I was going to have to stay on my toes. Hey! Stop! Oh, Frank. It wasn't my fault. That cow shouldn't have been in the road. Hurry up. You're letting the flies in. - What do you think? - Great setup. No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel. Perfect. Nice digs. But I'm here for the action. What is it? Bank, armoured car, payroll? You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk. Relax, Ma. - She's itching to use her new gun. - I know the feeling. It was Tanya. That bathing suit was never happier. I had only a second to admire the view. I had to watch out. If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf. Come here, sexy. You're all woman. I could tell by looking at you. Hey, she's referring to me. I was talking about your mother. MOTHER: That's no way to be walking around. Get some clothes on. And what are you doing in my bathing suit? Hey, who's the stud? Meet the newest member of our gang. Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters. Wait a minute. Don't I know you from somewhere? I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him. I get it all the time. It's the underwear ads. - Are you saying you're not a cop? - Well, yeah. - That's good enough for me. - Me, too. All right. I'm glad that's all cleared up. Ma, why not kiss and make up? Well, all right. Now that's more like it. Uh! Ow. FRANK: I had to get a message to Police Squad. This was more than I could handle. No phone, miles from civilisation, my prospects look bleaker than a gerbiI's in a bathhouse. Who's down there? Slasher. Have you seen my pigeon? - Pigeon? What pigeon? - What are you doing? I'm just contemplating my next move. Your bishop is exposed. It's these pants. I usually wear a fuller cut. You're all man. I like that in my men. You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem. - You're Jewish? - No. You're Rocco's girl. In my book, that chapter's called "Look, But Don't Touch". I could have two lovers. Kinky. But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one-on-one, with as little dribbling as possible. Oh, you're tense, Slasher. Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? All I know is it's downtown and big. That's the way I like it. - What else? - Just this. What are you doing? Thank you for the advice. I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters. How could you? Just shove your tongue in as far as you can. Oh! Quiet. You don't know me here. That's a goodbye kiss, sister. What's all this? Who's the skirt? Just some dizzy dame. Probably broke down. I'll take her to the bus depot. Hey, she's married. What if her husband comes looking? - He must be a great guy. - He breaks promises. Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him. - He left me. - You left him. - You should talk. - Listen to you. - Listen to you. - Listen to you. - Listen to you! - Listen to you! Jeez, you two, knock it off! - You'd think you're married! - What'll we do with her? One thing's for sure. There's no room for her here. - I say we bump her off. - Let's plug her here. I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage. We know women make the best hostages. They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice. Yeah, we got us an insurance policy. Good thinking, kid. Now, let's get some shuteye. We got a big day ahead of us. All right, it's rigged. Watch the tower, Slasher. This is what'll happen tonight. Hey, aren't we far away? Oh! ROCCO: All right, pay attention. On that tower's a device that's gonna net us 5 million bucks. We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching. - Your crowning achievement. - It's for both of us, Ma. All set! Set! Very impressive. Heh-heh-heh-heh. Cool. Heh-heh-heh-heh. Cool. America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act. This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding. We're almost there. I don't wanna miss this. Regards to Mrs Qaddafi. Tell her thanks for the cookies. PA: It's a beautifuI night in Los Angeles, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th Academy Awards. Fans are clamouring to see their favourite celebrities. It's Weird Al Yankovic and Vanna White. Put the dame in the trunk. I'll meet you and Ma round back in 10 minutes. Got the passes? If we pull this off, it's 5 million big ones. Not bad! - What's going to happen to me? - I have an idea. Right, Slasher. You know what to do. Check the tyres and fluid levels. No, you muffin head, the dame. We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield. PA: Ladies and gentlemen, to present the lifetime achievement award... Roll tape. Go to clip. Aspirin, please. Go to three.

Frank Drebin, Police Squad. - Isn't that a unusual? - It's happened before. - Here's the plan. - You'll never stop Rocco. - Your chances are one in a million. - Better than any state lottery. I'm the good guy. I can't let the bad guys win. Our children can't be raised in fear. They're going to blow that place sky high. It'll be a tragedy. Unless it's during a dance number. Come on.

Get a camera up there. This could be my best work. Any last words before I throw you off? - Yes. Don't do it. - Anything else? Frank, I love you. I want the world to know you're the perfect man. Frank, I hope you can hear me. They said I couldn't do drama. I was wrong. Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake. I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex. I realise that now, and other things. Everything's under control. Nobody move! Any vibration may set this thing off. Frank, I've learned my lesson.
