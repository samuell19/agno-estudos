I did the same thing when I found out that my parents volunteered to work for Black Hole. At first, I was so mad I just looked the other way. I mean, seriously, I did everything to avoid facing the consequences of their actions. But I had to stop running away and face my parents. And Iris, you have to do the same thing about this fear around this time sickness thing. Yeah, but I mean, what if Deon shows up tomorrow with bad news? - Yeah, that could happen.
