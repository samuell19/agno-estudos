A dyna'r newyddion. And now, at twenty to eight, the news of Wales. 500 miners at the Ogilvie Colliery in the Rhymney Valley have been informed by the National Coal Board that the pit will close. This follows a two-year period in which local politicians and trade unionists have fought to keep the colliery open. In the early '60s, the Ogilvie colliery was deemed a long-life pit with an expectancy of at least 80 years' work. However, following a fire in 1971, the south pit was closed. TOILET FLUSHES MAN COUGHS VIOLENTLY HE GAGS HE SPITS RADIO: ..unexplored coal at Ogilvie, the National Coal Board insists that the colliery has become an unviable productive unit. Miners at the colliery have already expressed their intention of fighting the... ..last night stranded on Snowdon was rescued today and taken to Bangor Hospital, where he was treated for frostbite and exposure. The boy, Alun Richards, of Cwfelinfach, was later allowed to leave the hospital and return home. The local branch of the Farmers' Union of Wales have expressed concern over the increase in the level of imports from the European Community, and at a meeting in Llandrindod Wells today they will discuss the problem with representatives from the Welsh Office. HE COUGHS ENGINE STARTS RADIO PLAYS LIGHT JAZZ RADIO: Our reporter in the Rhymney Valley talked to Mr Evan Jones, the lodge secretary at the Ogilvie Colliery, who has been responsible for the two-year fight to keep the pit open. REPORTER: Do you feel that the Coal Board, then, have done everything that they can to save this pit? JONES: No, I don't think they have done all they can. Neither, if I may say so, have the Government, because the Government could have intervened here, and they could have overruled the decision of the Coal Board. And I'm bitterly disappointed that, with a Labour government, that they haven't intervened and overruled the decision of the Coal Board against the closure of this pit. REPORTER: Do you feel that you as workers have done everything that you can to make the pit a paying proposition? JONES: The work performed by the men at Ogilvie... WOMAN: Now, don't forget to phone that Mr Jones today, that lodge secretary, to see what they're going to do about things. Do you hear? All right, I'll go down now. As soon as I've finished shaving. Oh, well, you know what they're like, them and the councillors. Oh, we know that. We only see them when it's election time, don't we? Yes, that's right. LOUD BANGING AND WHIRRING HORN BEEPS CLANKING DROWNS OUT WORDS OK, then. Righto. ANIMATED CONVERSATION Now, calm down. Calm down. Right? Calm down. - Dai phoned me this morning. - Righto. Forget about it. What about the morning, now? What time we got to be up Friday morning? Half past five? - No, no. - Half past eight? No, no, wait a minute, now, Rhodri. You've got the times of the buses there. HE COUGHS I... As far as I'm concerned, and I know that you share my view on this, we must... Nothing must be hidden from the men in any way. The whole facts. We've been truthful up to now with the men, informing them, advising them all the way through, and I think that we must not vary from that line of thought in any way on Saturday morning. The truth and the facts have got to be revealed to the men, right? However distasteful they may be to us, we can't hide anything from the men. It's their right to know. Hello there, bach. Did you have a letter this morning? - Yes. - And I did. - I'm very satisfied. - Now that I've had a letter, I think it's time that we acted now, find out what's involved. I'm coming down to ring the coalfield. - Right. - I'll ring them now. That's a good idea, Bryn. Now, let us know how you get on. All right. Hello. Can you put me through to Evans, please? Windsor Rees speaking. I had a letter from... Windsor had a letter from the Coal Board... - Oh, yes? - ..this morning, - and I opened it. - Mm? And what do you think? They're, er, making them redundant, all the men between... ..58 and, er... - ..and 63. - Oh! And he's one of those that...that are... ..that come under that. So, er... I told him I'm glad to be out of it now. Well, I should think so, a man in your condition. Expected to go to another pit, Windsor? Oh, I couldn't do it. I told him. I think that would be terrible. He appreciates that I can't do it. And he thinks it'll be all right? - Definitely. - And he said a letter - in the second post? - Should be in the second post. - Not to worry, then. - No, I'm not worrying. Well, thank goodness for that. Aye, indeed. At the same time... ..sorry for the boys that have had to go. Yes, aye. Been here since they were about 16. 14, 16 years of age. - Some of them have. - Aye. WINDSOR COUGHS But there you are, we're numbers when we finish. - Aren't we? Numbers, we are. - Aye. WINDSOR COUGHS - No point grumbling. - No. Every other industry's got the opportunity, when they're faced with such a crisis as we are, of any payment in accordance with the Redundancy Act. And I think it's a damn shame that we're not awarded the same benefits as other industries. So he'll have to go on the dole or something, see? I mean, you can't live on this for any length of time, on what we've saved, and this redundancy pay that he's bound to have, isn't he? That's right. Oh, yeah. I don't know... I don't know whether I'm on my head or my heels, to tell the truth. Personally, Dai, I think that, having reached this position, erm, the union have accepted it, er, the, er, the party and the MPs that have been with us throughout have accepted it, and they've made it known to us in no uncertain terms that we have reached the end of the road. I think that our main preoccupation now, Dai, is to protect the interests of all the men at the pit by way of redundancies and also, Dai, by job securities in the way of transfers to other pits, if that's what you think. FAINT CHATTER ..ready, relaying it elsewhere. ..never showing me the reason there's no redundancy... This new... - What's the inducement? - Er, no... The new... ..because we've been gulled all along. I can't see how they can say that the closure of Ogilvie Colliery has come about just like that. I think, myself, and deep, deep in myself, that they've known for months and months, years back, that they've known that Ogilvie Colliery's going to close. And they've disillusioned the men. As soon as they started putting it about Ogilvie's going to close, bang. Straight away, men's feelings... Well, men have got to look after theyselves. This is it. They started leaving the industry, leaving Ogilvie Colliery, and they started whittling away and going out looking for jobs theyselves. They thought, "Oh, well, we'd better not wait. "If we all wait here now for Ogilvie to close, bang, "we won't get a job elsewhere." So they tried to jump on the wagon and they all started leaving, like rats going from a ship. Everybody realises that if Ogilvie closes, that they will be herded from pillar to post. The promises and assurances given by...Phil Weekes... ..well, we know that the promises of the Coal Board are not worth a light. We know that... Go back 15 years, when it was... ..the Coal Board issued a policy that there was a minimum of 60 years' work in Ogilvie. A great deal of money had been spent here, but it's quite obvious that if they are successful in closing Ogilvie, that it's a boon for the scrap people, and then it's a boon, then, for private industry to rebuild exactly the same project in another colliery. ..and we've been promised these jobs that are the same as what we were having in Ogilvie Colliery, and we know very well the offers that we've been having now are disgusting. Nothing short of disgusting. They've been promising this and promising that, and, er... ..we know in ourselves that we're not going to end up with the jobs, the way it's going now. But of course, we've got to wait for our last and final offers. And if we don't get any better satisfaction, we're going to be chucked on the scrapheap. And that's the end of it. ENGINE RUMBLES ENGINE STOPS VEHICLE APPROACHES Well, comrades, this is one of the saddest days in the history of the Ogilvie Lodge. I have to report to you this morning... ..that Mr Weekes, the director of the South Wales coalfield, attended a meeting at the lodge on Wednesday morning, and he brought the sad news of his intention to close Ogilvie Colliery. He stated that it was his intention to support the view which had been expressed before... ..that he'd seen no other thing, nothing else and no other alternative but for the closure of the colliery. To give a fuller, more detailed report on this, I'll ask the lodge secretary to make his comments. Comrades... ..we have failed. We have used the political field in every way possible. All this having been done, at the end of the day, and despite the fact that we can argue and we are convinced that our case was a solid and just one from the very outset, our position and our view today remains exactly the same. Despite the decision... ..being an adverse one as far as we're concerned, our position has not changed from that one which we started out on at the very outset. HORN TOOTS BRAKES SCREECH - You going down to Porthcawl? - Yes. Can you drop us off? Cheers. Well, having discussed our problem seriously and looked at all aspects of it... ..we, after all, as officers, will carry out your dictates. And we will do as you have instructed us to do and inform the board of our refusal to accept the decision for the closure of Ogilvie Colliery. But as you've decided to demonstrate to the South Wales conference, which will be held on next Saturday morning, it's important that the same feeling that you've demonstrated this morning will be expressed on that particular morning and that the buses that will be available to travel to Bridgend, to the conference, will be full. Cheers. All the best. See you. WINDSOR COUGHS There we are, then, Win. What you really need is a bloody good holiday, like I had. Over to New Zealand seeing the wife's in-laws. OK, you can get ready now, if you want to. OK. The, erm... This whole thing is playing you out, isn't it? Yes. How much oxygen are you using at the moment? Oh, quite a lot, Doctor. In the mornings, I need an inch quite a lot. Is it? WINDSOR COUGHS Your card's getting a fair thickness on it now, you know? Yes. See, all of this now, over the last few years, see? See, you've been having boards now for 20 years. And, er, every one of them, no pneumoconiosis...emphysema, the lot of them. See, you have to take it easy, just like I said. All right? Erm, there's a question of... ..early retirement. I think you'll have to consider yourself retired, because if you don't take it easy... ..well, you might as well... nos da. - Yes. - Do you see? WINDSOR COUGHS "Emphysema", that dreaded word. The other thing, of course, you've got to remember - you know you're taking those water tablets? Right, so you know that this is important, rather, that you don't have too much fluid intake, you know? It's rather difficult, of course, with the cold weather. You've got to join in with the old boys, you know, the occasional thing, haven't you? Well, I do have an occasional orangeade, Doctor. You do? You can't do the pints any more? - No. - No. HE COUGHS What the hell are you doing home again? Where have you been? What did the doctor say, then? What did the doctor say? I've been to the doctor's over a dozen times this year. Nothing they can do. I've had X-rays... Er, nothing they can do. - Pit shutting, then, is it? - Mm. Well, I could have told you that two years ago. Oh, what do you know about it? Look how different it would have been! Look at your bloody leaders. Where are your leaders? Two years! It's been on the cards for two bloody years, this pit shutting. It's a bloody good thing it has shut. Perhaps you'll wake up and do something with your life instead of wasting your time in that bloody hole. It was a living. A living? It was a bloody dying. It was a death. - Death on two legs. - You haven't had to go down. I know I haven't had to go down there. I wouldn't. You wouldn't catch me down that bloody thing for all the bloody tea in China. Look at you! WINDSOR COUGHS Two years ago I could have told you. and you never bloody listened to me then, did you? You don't give a damn about anyone else but yourself, and look at you now. You're a bloody broken man. - You're finished. - Well, I had to think of my wife and child, didn't I? If you'd thought about your wife and bloody child, you'd have got out years ago instead of wasting your bloody time sticking at it, following your bloody stupid leaders. They don't give a damn. They care about themselves. They're all up in bloody London. Look at them all. Ministers. Labour members. Look at them! People round here, you follow like bloody donkeys. You've been like sheep behind those men, and they've done bugger all for you all their lives. They've been feathering their own bloody nests. - Look at 'em! - I think so, it is a mess. Have you seen all the bloody homes and the farms in the Home Counties of England? Full up. Occupied by bloody Labour MPs from South Wales. Full of them, it is! Doing well, they are... HE COUGHS VIOLENTLY Fattening themselves at your bloody expense! PUMP MOTOR RUNS DOG BARKS Go on, get back there. Go on! Get back there, go on. BARKING CONTINUES - How's it going, then, Mal? - Morning, Dai. - Is this the bus to Bridgend? - This is the one, yeah. - Ready, then? - Aye, I'm ready, aye. ENGINE STARTS I'd like to have a little bungalow up here now. - I wouldn't like it up here. - Quiet enough, see, boy? Aye, but getting up to it, man, all the time. You'd want a car, definitely. You'd want a car. MAN COUGHS Hello, Tom, boy! Coming to the meeting? I don't feel well enough today, Tom. - Man, come on! - No, I'm sorry. Come on, man! They're all coming. After the report, when we went to London and lobbied our MPs, the boys had the stuffing knocked out of them. Dai, bach... There ought to be two buses from every lodge in South Wales, cos you don't know who'll be next on the chopper. Now, what we're doing, we send this bus straight down, look? Now, we're going to pick the men up in Aberbargoed, right? Coming through Tredegar. Right? And then we'll meet down by Pengam, all right? I'll wait for you by Pengam. Crossroads, eh? No, I tell you what, you carry on straight down there, right? All right? You carry on straight down. You on that bus? You got that. I'll arrange these boys now. They're going straight down. - We'll meet up down there. - Very good. BUS ENGINE RUMBLES ..what the lodge is. McLaren and Ogilvie. And they wanted to integrate them two collieries. Now, we're Ogilvie. Because they said this is the central point. HE COUGHS "And if you'll agree to this integration, "the life of this colliery will be 80 years." - Aye. - And yet, 20 years after, they've put a lid on it. It's a bit of a joke, - when you think of it. - It is, yes, yeah. Now, we're listening to the experts. But what do you think... CAR ROARS PAST LIVELY CONVERSATIONS INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS On the lights? You'll be there, will you? Fair enough. You know the other buses will have gone? At the end of the day, oh, it's fair enough. Of course, you understand on this now, that, er... ..even if we don't benefit as a colliery as a result of this demonstration today, it's...for collieries that are situated the same as ourselves. The pit is the community. If they close this pit now, if they close Ogilvie, the next one might be Bargoed, and the whole community. They'd just as well make a reservoir out of that valley NEWS REPORT: Busloads of miners from the doomed Ogilvie Colliery today lobbied fellow mineworkers at a coalfield conference in Bridgend. The purpose of the demonstration was to draw the attention of their colleagues in other pits to the problems involved in the closure and to call for solidarity from the entire Welsh coal industry. - Colin? - Hello, John. - How are you, brother? - Certainly, brother! HE LAUGHS Well, what I've done, boys, I've tried to arrange a deputation to be allowed into the conference with the president and the general secretary. They won't permit this, because, as they say, we're taking authority off the executive body. And as a result, they don't mind what demonstrations we carry on outside the building and what lobbying would take place, but they're not going to permit a deputation to be in the conference itself to put our case to the conference. The president said he will make a statement, as far as he's concerned, to the conference in relation to the Ogilvie Colliery closure and he will be attending a meeting, as you know, tomorrow night at Pontlottyn, half past five. And he'll put his case, as he sees it, on Ogilvie tomorrow night. But he won't allow, unfortunately... He can't permit a deputation. That's what he said. "I can't permit a deputation." We already know what they think when the executive took a decision before they met Ogilvie. Well, what we want is the chairman of this conference to reaffirm his decision of last May, you see? This is the problem. I realise that, but of course here we have the problem that the executive council have gone the opposite way on the last meeting. Now, had they allowed us to get a deputation in, there'd be something there. But they're saying... The words used... "We cannot permit," were the words used, "a deputation into the conference." They've had a week to study this lot, and it should have been sorted out by this morning for the men to know what's really happening here. INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS I haven't seen him, right? But I'm sure that he will be prepared to make a statement, and I'm hoping he'll have a chance to make a statement in the conference. Oh, no, no, we can laugh. Running us down to the ground, they are. They're terrible! I got no confidence in you or Dai Francis. I'll be honest with you. They want to study it more, yeah? Cos they're running us down to the bloody ground. Why you have invited members of the Coal Board I don't know, but it'll make a lot of thoughts. And if you want any more, you can have them from Ystrad Fawr, too. Give it to brother Dai on the stage. Backhanders, that's all they're having, yeah? When you leave a young pit go like this, you want to think of the other pits, mate. Every one of you. For your involvement as well as us. Definite. "United we stand, united we bloody fall," the lot of you ought to say. Now, let the profiles out down there, my friend. I've said my piece. There's a bloke you want to take a film of. There's a bloke you want to take a film of, the man there. Cutting our legs from under us. That's what you're doing. He hasn't got the guts, man. Never has had any guts. Roll on Sunday, this meeting. Go over and see him. Come on, walk over to him. He won't do it for me. He's not worth it. INDISTINCT How did you get on with the meeting, Tom? Dead loss. - I thought it would be. - I've given it up as a bad job. - Have you? - Aye. I've got no faith in that contest. Nor Emlyn. Oh, well... - It's all over. - All over? What a shame, eh? Dai Morgan? Dai Morgan! Hey, Windsor. Windsor? Just a minute. I want a word with you, if you don't mind. HE COUGHS - Hello, Dai. - Windsor. How are things? Oh, not very good. I'm sorry to hear about your illness and the bout you've had with your chest. Bad bout... Aye. But anyhow, as far as your position up at the colliery now... ..you don't want to go up there again now. You'll be one of those they make redundant. As far as I'm concerned, we all have been given redundancy, because a man having given years of service, which most people have given up there, well, they ought to be given the option of going out redundant, and that should be the end of their service. WINDSOR COUGHS AND SPITS But anyhow, in your own case, you will be one of those that's fortunate enough to go out. We'll hear from the board. We'll have a lump sum, something in the region of about a hundred... ..er, 1,400, something like that. And you'll have a weekly payment of nine-tenths of your take-home pay, which is something about £30, it was. Provided your wife isn't working. So, all in all, you won't be too bad, Windsor. You'll be pretty well off. It's better than being put to the road, as we used to, one time. All right? ENGINES ROAR CHATTER TV: Ogilvie miners lobbied a coalfield conference at the weekend to try to persuade the South Wales Executive to change their minds over accepting the Coal Board's decision to close the colliery... PUB CHAT DROWNS OUT NEWS REPORT - Where were they, then? - Bridgend. - Bridgend? - Over in Bridgend. It was a case of last-ditch. Last-ditch. ..and a livelihood for the valley, the Rhymney Valley. Some of the men of Ogilvie Colliery, then. With me in the studio now is the NUM president, Mr Joe Gormley, who's on a visit to South Wales. Mr Gormley, it must make you feel very unhappy to see a situation like this over a pit closure. I've been concerned in quite a lot of pit closures in my own area in Lancashire, and it's always an emotional scene when a pit closes. But... I can't understand him. What is he saying now? He's mumbling! ..tell us there's a very good future for coal in South Wales and in the whole of Britain. Do you accept that point of view? Well, I want to put it over to all the members of the NUM that, for the first time, we can guarantee, in the future, security of employment, which is far different from the position we've had over the last 15 years. Britain wants every ounce of coal it can produce at a price which fits into the market. That doesn't mean to say that every little pocket of coal must be explored, because it's impossible to do that. But there's such a future in front of the industry now that there needs to be no unemployment amongst miners. And, in fact, we're looking for more miners to man some of the pits in different parts of the country. And South Wales is no different than that. Well, I can't understand a lot that he's saying, but the little bit that I've heard, I would doubt if he's on our side! After hearing him speaking, I think we can throw the sponge in. Couldn't we? ..to convince the board about the other pit. - Mr Gormley, thank you. - Thank you. Here's a very disturbing fact. Three-quarters of the children in Wales have bad and decaying teeth... Hot meals, this is. That's what they call it, see? Hot meals! Meals on wheels! Hot meals today! Aye! Put a bit of iron in your blood, this will. Trying to look a mouse in the face! Have a cigarette, boys. Thank you. But we're going in five minutes. Five? Thank you. Well, it's a sad day for us, boys, Friday. Well, we've got to go, boy. We've got to go. Aye, but we shouldn't have gone in the first place. That's true enough, that's true enough. The union... I don't know whether they're going the back door or the front door, but it'd make you wonder. If Joe Gormley said you've got to go, you've got to go. What can you do? If the leaders don't support you, what are you going to do, isn't it? As far as Gormley's concerned, you can't ever get pork. - Well, I tell you now... - What do you mean, pork? We're bloody human beings here! I had faith in this pit till he come on the television. Now, when he announced that we don't have... ..well, to me, the way I've got to see it, a cat in hell's chance of saving this pit, something's definite wrong. - Definite wrong. - I agree with you. For the simple reason, whether he's after a knighthood, but this union of ours got to stick to their guns and fight more for the working man than for theyselves. And then Joe Gormley, then, sitting on a stone with a flute... ..and the snakes are coming up. And Joe Gormley was... "Joe Gormley, NCB." THEY LAUGH Ah, right enough. There was quite a few on the transfer tonight. Now, Robertson, Robertson... What have you done? You've closed the pit, you... LAUGHTER Aye, that's right, Olwyn. Joe Gormley has the axe, doesn't he? They've executed us now. They say they're going to execute Ebbw Vale now. INDISINCT CONVERSATION Michael Foot is a poacher turned bloody gamekeeper. He said when he was in Opposition he wouldn't close any. When he climbed up the ladder, "You stop down the bloody ladder, boys. "I don't want nothing to do with you." This is Michael Foot! And you can say what you like about Fred Evans - one of the best MPs we've had. Definite. And the poor bugger's bad in bed now. I mean, it is a result to think that we had to turn down... ..and fetch a Tory government down for this, the state of affairs. And this is them preaching to us we'd be better off. - This is it. - Huh? A lot better off. We're a damn sight worse off. We have taken action, worse action, for less than it, to help support, to put our executives where they are today, executive members. So, how long do you think this will go on? - I should think about an hour. - You're sure Winnie's behind? - Yes. - Can you see? Directly behind us, yes. So, you deposited the whole family on the first citizen, did you? Indeed, yes, the first citizen, with his new car. The boys are going to do an audition for the Gwent Youth Band this morning. So they're not here. But Geraint is there, so Stephen will be with him. Did the Ashvale residents come to see you? They did indeed. What's happening up there, then? Well, they're arguing about improvement grants, improvements to the houses that the Welsh Office has been prepared to agree to, but, er... ..their alternative plans have been turned down, and now the council has apparently said to them, "Here, if you don't... "..if you don't accept the plan within a fortnight, "you're going to be evicted," and that they're proposing to send out notices to that effect. I don't know whether that is really the case. - Which houses are these? - In Ashvale. Ashvale themselves? INDISTINCT - Is it? - Yeah! Look, I'm not unmindful, man, that we've got men involved here, but it's happened four times to them! Pidwell's, right, to Elliot's. Elliot's to Croesfaen. Croesfaen to Ogilvie. I got to accept this. And I realise why men are reacting in the way they are! Right? Because they're wondering, "Well, how long am I going there for?" I know this! And you can't turn a blind eye to it. - No, I know. - You've got to accept men's feelings. And I'm not prepared to underestimate men's feelings. But having said that, what one must realise is - right, cos we're in the position we are - and as long as men are prepared to accept the consequences that'll follow, that's all right, providing that it's done in a uniform manner. Right? And that there's solidarity amongst the men. And it isn't right that there's men going away from that pit now, which I met last week, mind. But see, we can't afford to get like this, because what they're doing, they're deserting their comrades. And they've been a party to reaching that decision with their comrades. Having been a party to reaching that decision with their comrades, surely, right, as socialists and as democrats, they must stand there. Go to one of the nightclubs! - Stephen? - Morning. Hello, Gary. Er, every possibility of carrying this fight through to a successful conclusion has been carried through as well as it possibly could have been done. The fight that has been conducted to save this colliery has been put in the best possible way. It has been led by your leaders here in the way that was calculated to have success if success was possible. You have fought in every way to try and succeed and to keep open the possibility of saving the pit. But I do believe that, tragically... ..the only sensible course now is to acknowledge the defeat. I know it's not an easy thing to do, but I believe it has to be done, and that is why I gave the answer that I did to Evan Jones when he asked me a week ago. But I also said to him, as I said then, that I was of course quite prepared to come and listen to anything you had to say to me about it. But that was my opinion. I've given you the fundamental reasons why I think that that is the case, and I fear, therefore, that we will have to face it. But anyhow, I'm here, as I promised, to hear what you may have to say to me about it, and we will see what we proceed with that. ..and if it is the intention of whatever government is in power to hold the trust and confidence in the minds of the miners, to give to them the energy needed to this country, which is required as a means of running this country, then they must be shown in no uncertain terms that the right and proper thing will be done to the men within this industry when a situation of this kind arises again. Now, I know I'm talking here to the manpower of a colliery that has devoted anything from 20-to 40-odd years in the colliery. And I would like the MPs to take note... ..that when we get the cessation of a colliery, the closure of a colliery like Ogilvie, it's only right and proper that justice is done by every man in the pit on the closure, because it's a heart-rending experience. It's the most difficult period you can ever live through. I'm speaking from my own personal experience on this. And when you think - and I'm talking of my case - of 35 years of loyal service to an industry, there must be something more than just, "Go down the road "to the next pit". It is the fact that the Government has done its best, in my opinion, to carry out its pledge to the miners. Certainly, I wouldn't be prepared to stay in any government which didn't carry out its pledges to the miners. And if you take it all in all, I think we've done it, you know. I think we're entitled to claim that. WINDSOR COUGHS Look at this here. Troed-y-rhiw, Merthyr Tydfil. "Pre-owned three-bedroomed terraced house "close to all amenities. "Good-sized dining room, kitchen, "with Cotswold stone feature fireplace. "Brand-new kitchen, "fitted shower room with separate toilet. "Extras include carpets and Venetian blinds. 28,750." Here's another one. WINDSOR HAS A COUGHING FIT COUGHING CONTINUES ..because we at Ogilvie are convinced that Ogilvie has not been closed because of its reserves. It's closed because it needed the manpower in the first place to fill other pits. But we should have had either a public inquiry or we should have had an independent mining engineer to look at a further glance at the resources that are still at Ogilvie. There are many questions taken together, and observations. Would you like to have a go? NEIL KINNOCK MURMURS Now, first of all on the question of, er... ..the belief that the closure of Ogilvie was proposed in the first place by the Coal Board not because of the position of the pit itself and the reserves or what reserves there might be there but because they were short of manpower at other pits and wanted therefore to disperse people from here in order to man up the other pits. And I know that that was part of the case that was put at the beginning of the whole campaign, and certainly we looked carefully at those propositions, and I can well understand how that view was widely held. We do need to change the structure of the National Coal Board. And my opinion has not changed because we're in government, because that has been a constant message that I have tried to promote during all the time I've been in politics, that you cannot have... ..a nationalised industry that has the affection of the people and the respect of the people who work in it if it isn't a democratically conducted industry. So what we try to secure and what I hope we shall have in the lifetime of every person in this room is workers' control of the coal industry. We've told them and told them and told them and told them till we're sick of telling them. And I know, if it is possible to say, "Dai, it's your pit taken over," that within eight to ten months we could make a profit there. I know that, man. We've said this over and over and over. But the stark facts are that the experts and the people who are authorised to run the industry at the moment under statute are determined that - in their views, right? - the pit will be uneconomical. On their appraisal, right? And the unfortunate spectacle we've got now, mind, is that the South Wales Executive and the National Executive is supporting their line. These are the troubles we're in. I hope you won't have any doubt at all about what I'm saying. We are determined, not only in the interests of the miners but in the interests of the miners as well, but also in the interests of the country, the nation... ..to build up the coal industry and sustain it to the full. That's the policy of the Government. And certainly I wouldn't stay a member of a government that was doing anything different. APPLAUSE Gentlemen, I will say let's show our appreciation. Could I say a word? Everybody that has been on that platform this last fortnight has said what a wonderful case that has been put. Now, there's Joe Gormley on television, saying it was a bloody flimsy case in the beginning. - So who are we to believe? - Let me answer this one. Let me tell you this much, and I'd tell this to Joe Gormley, to his face. He never presented a case at London - anywhere! - ..for the retention of Ogilvie Colliery. He wanted presenting that case resting on our shoulders. Now, let's face up to this one, boys. And it's quite easy for Joe Gormley to talk in the manner that he did on Monday night when he visited South Wales. And he didn't come here for the purpose of discussing Ogilvie. INTERRUPTIONS FROM AUDIENCE Right? It was Joe Gormley's intention... Hush up, boys. Hush now, boys. Right? INTERRUPTIONS CONTINUE Look, I told Neil and I told Michael as they came in through the door this morning! Now that Mr Michael Foot and Mr Neil Kinnock have left the meeting, you've heard their report, and as difficult as it is to accept, I think that we have traversed every avenue we can, and all parties and all people who have participated in the fight up to now, including the two MPs that have left... ..have told us that we have got to accept the inevitable. And I see no alternative but to put to the lodge, reluctantly as it is... ..this vote for you to accept the closure of this colliery. He came there... What effect would we have had on him? You tell me. - Nothing. - Well, none at all! You went there to ask them questions, and you should have asked them, right? Why was the National Coal Board allowed, to start with... ..why were they allowed to close the pit? Why was the union... ..Gormley...why was Gormley allowed to say the things that he said on television? Of course, this was out of their hands. He said before the election, "We will not or must not close." - Right, he did. - So why change his tune? He hasn't changed his tune, man! I only read it a couple of nights ago! "Ogilvie will close," he said. It was obvious, what he told them. But they're changing their minds! He wasn't a cabinet minister then, was he? Now he is the man in the middle, now, isn't he? We're talking about Michael Foot now. We had the president and the secretary there. - Now, what did they tell him? - What did they say? They expected a more hostile meeting than that. Oh, they did say that? They didn't tell us that. What was you doing? What's you doing? They spoke. You didn't agree with what they said, and there you was, clapping them. Who was clapping them? I wasn't. The biggest part of the hall was clapping them. So that was the reception. It meant that you was agreeing with the things that they were saying. Ah, but they didn't realise what them fellas were saying. They were blinding them, weren't they? Could have been blinding anybody. - You'd better be blinded! - Did he blind you? - He couldn't. No! - He didn't blind me, too. - Nobody told me. - He didn't. No. Well, I think the chances are good that you will get accommodated. But where? And in what? Possibly in your own job. Now, we were given this assurance - to men in the meeting... - That's right. ..that they would be accommodated in jobs exactly the same as they've got now. ALL GREET EACH OTHER Well, gentlemen, now that we've met, our cause, I'm pretty certain, is a common one - that we've got to deal in this unpleasant situation in arranging the transfers of the men from Ogilvie and the closure of the pit. Now, what you are finding is that everybody else seems to be getting fixed up. Then you've got the worry of moving to another pit. But this worry on top of it, not knowing where you are going, - is that much worse. - It is. And I think this is evident with the biggest part of the people that's in the shop. There are people in the shop now who don't know where they're going. SOMEONE WHISTLES A TUNE QUIET CONVERSATIONS 3459. E Slade. - Yes. - 3 Watson Row, Deri. 5106. J Barratt. It's the bastard tax again. Aye? Stinking. MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCT CHATTER We'll see the right thing is done by every man. And there's no man been put under pressure and there's no man going to be put under pressure. I mean, if I went out there now and said... CLANGING DROWNS SPEECH - Yeah. - ..the boys would go again. And by the time they'd reached the top end of the yard... It starts there but it ends there. - Right? - That'll do. I'll accept it, right? And they're accusing you of hiding things from us, - which, for me, is... - Well, you can accuse me, but I haven't hidden anything from anyone. I'm not saying you have. I didn't intend it as a threat. I was truthful with Geoff Davis this morning. I was truthful with Ben Wright this morning. And I was truthful with Dai Small this morning. I was there when they were being interviewed, and I told Ben Wright exactly where I stood and where I still stand. INDISTINCT CHATTER Well, listen up. There you are, Jim. Is you has gone, and there's Big Bill has gone this morning. I know, he told me. And so you can see now, boys, innit, right? Now that the transfer's taken place, there are some men desperate for tools, because they haven't got any, and so they're prepared to go to any depth to get them now. But the only thing is, Jim, we're not able to identify who they are, are we? You know my views about this. You know damn well my views about this for a long time. They are having the same money as you, Jim, and they should be providing the same tools. Yes... A nice cup of tea now. MAN WHISTLES A cup of tea. - Toast? - I got toast this morning. There you are. It's the oldest bloke in the shop anywhere. Oldest bloke. And the craftiest and the dark horsiest! And the chopsiest! Aye. Chopsy c... - Shut up, you. - Less of your language. You're a big chapel man... When I went up to meet the people concerned with the deployment, and I was offered a position as a fitter and a ground regular in deep navigation, which was not acceptable to me, by any means. And the other offer, then, was about... ..if I was...we would be willing to stop at the colliery in the position of salvaging... ..and I...I said I'd be willing to take this, providing I could get a better job later on, then, when the pit finish...as it is with the salvaging. And he said, "Well, we have a position that we can give you "as a general surface man." On top of the pit. Well, like I said, I didn't go to school for five years to have a brush and shovel pitched on my back and walk around the top of the pit. If they think that that's acceptable to a craftsman, they can work it, because it's not acceptable to me and I can't see any other craftsman accepting it either. - Everitt? - Everitt. - I, double T. - I, double T. 15 Heol Iago. I-A-G-O. Mochriw. Let us not create friction between comrade. Let's deal with it in the right way. It'll prevent any friction whatsoever arising between you. Do you think seniority should have come into this? Seniority doesn't come into it. Our...our concern, look, right, and our role in this particular situation is to ensure that every man's accommodated. Yeah, well, it's bound to cause a bit of friction... I know. But we haven't created the friction. - No. - It's meddlers, - if I can put it that way. - Aye. Aye. Meddling into matters which don't concern them that have caused this friction. Right? They know that, and you know that yourself, Ben. Meddlers they've been, look. Meddle in the affairs that don't concern them. - And... - You won't stop people talking. - And you haven't. - No, you won't stop. I agree with you, Ben. You won't stop people talking. But in a situation of this kind, you've got to be - very, very tactful. - Hmm. Right? You've got to use a tremendous amount of discretion. Right? You've got to try and realise a man's feelings - and a man's reactions. - That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm trained to do. I think the men are bringing the tools up now, so... All right. You know what's going on? That's fair enough. All right. MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCT CHATTER DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES HE COUGHS Windsor? Windsor? HE GASPS Windsor? HE WHEEZES Are you all right? Windsor! Windsor! Windsor. All right, Mr Rees? Feel OK? Just going to roll you over gently now, all right? All right, lovely boy. HE GROANS OK? Easy does it now. DOCTOR: Gently. Right. Over you come now, then. HE COUGHS All right. Bad news, mate? I'll take you to the hospital now. Come on. INDISTINCT CHATTER All right, Mr Rees? Not too much pain? All right? Just going to take your pulse and your blood pressure. WINDSOR: All right. Joe Bryce, right? 58 years of age, a collier. He's been to the specialist at Llandough. And the specialist at Llandough's told him that he's taking a third of the oxygen into his lungs, because of his condition, which a normal man takes. Right? The other one is Garfield Davies. Right? 59 years of age. He's come to me. I've got Garfield down. Islwyn Jones, right? Garfield is suffering ill health. Islwyn Jones. Suffering with bronchitis and emphysema. 59 years of age. I've got him down. HE COUGHS LABOURED BREATHS It's not too much for you, is it, Windsor, me being here? No. Don't let us carry this exercise out because the board wants to see it through as quick as possible. Right? Now, I think we've got a duty as well... ..that we will take our time over this and not be hasty in the decision we're going to make. I told Elwyn Williams last Friday afternoon, when I broke off... on the telephone, that he and anybody else could do just what they like, but we, as a lodge, we're not going to sit back and allow our men to be transferred into other pits to be hobbledehoys. They were either going in, right, to be engaged, right, and accommodated in work comparable to that which they were now performing in Ogilvie or they weren't going there at all. They were going to be received in the right and proper spirit and in the proper atmosphere and treated as men within the pit they are receiving at, or they weren't going to go there at all. I've repeated that this morning, and I think the chairman can verify that. I've been criticised and slammed for A to Z, but I'm making no apologies for what I've done, Glyn. I've done it with the interests of the men in my heart. I haven't done it from a personal point of view, I'm done it from the duties which I'm expected to perform. And I've succeeded to some extent. Not 100% I haven't succeeded but I've succeeded in getting men into work to a great extent. And I've taken the lacing for it. But let that be as it may. Now, I offered Crad Tredegar Works last Friday. And Crad told me, "I want pity, not work." WINDSOR GROANS Got any pain? WINDSOR MURMURS WINDSOR COUGHS You'll do better after a couple of days' rest.

BIRDSONG NEWS: ..involving local authority officials will continue. It was a sad day at Ogilvie Colliery in the Rhymney Valley on Friday, when the pit finally closed after being in operation for 60 years. This means that all the pits at the top end of the Rhymney Valley have now been closed down, and the men from Ogilvie are now transferring to nearby pits in adjoining valleys at Bargoed, Trelewis and at the Merthyr Vale Colliery in Aberfan. - Full name? - May, Sidney Ernest May.

THEY LAUGH AND CHAT INDISTINCT CHATTER Comrades, I'd say this, that all of us were sorry to see Ogilvie closing down, there's no question at all about it, but I suppose these things become inevitable and here you are now - your section of the workforce in Ogilvie have come to Merthyr Vale. Now, I'd say at the outside now that for many years now, I'd say, well, for several years anyway, I'd say there's been a good relationship between the lodge, then, and the management at the pit. We're not short of saying a few words and having our up and downers, of course, but, generally speaking, I would say that there's a fairly good relationship between management and the men and the lodge at Merthyr Vale Colliery. Now, I met quite a number of you this morning and they are quite important problems to you, of course - you're the people involved, and you're being transferred. And at the outset I would say that we'd have to apologise... THEY GREET EACH OTHER MONITOR BEEPS BEEPING STOPS NO SOUNDTRACK SOUNDTRACK RESTARTS DRILL RATTLES CONTINUOUS BEEP BEEP STOPS Mrs Rees...
