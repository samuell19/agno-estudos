The Erasers Yes? You are late, Garimati. Three minutes. It's for tonight. 7:30. Sharp. I got you a silencer. Daniel Dupont. College teacher. Surveyor Street, number 2. In the upper side of the city. An isolated house. He lives alone with an old lady. No need to hang around the place too early. Here are the instructions. They are so precise you could execute with your eyes closed. At 6:55, not one minute earlier, you calmly arrive in Surveyor Street. The railings can't be closed anymore, we've taken care of it. Don't take the driveway, there are gravels. Walk on the lawn. Wait by the bay tree. Dupont is working. It's 7:00. Dupont turns off the lamp on his table. And goes downstairs for dinner. It's the right time. Cross the garden and get around the house by its left side. You have five minutes to get there. The old lady is waiting for him to finish his soup. Proceed quietly. Don't open the door too wide, the hinges would squeak. - I'll cook escalopes tomorrow. - Oh yes! Escalopes! - With peas? - No, salad. And for supper an omelet. Quickly reach the stairs. Don't worry, the floor is covered with a carpet. Be careful on the landing. Under the painting, the floor creaks. First door on your left His study room. The ceiling light is on, don't turn it off yet. You have time. Dupont never goes upstairs before 7:30. Walk past the desk. Hide behind the perennial plant. You're in place. Turn off the light. You are invisible in the dark. When Dupont opens the door, calmly shoot three bullets in his heart. Calmly get out. No excessive haste. Don't be afraid, the telephone line is cut. The old lady can't hear a thing. Anna! She is deaf. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Hello? The Allies Café, yes. Surveyor Street, yes. Wallas? Say no more, I got it. One moment, I'll see. Hello? Do you hear me? Hello? Hello? You heard the news? A guy named Albert Dupont has been assassinated yesterday, in this street. - Daniel. - What, Daniel? - Daniel Dupont. - No, I'm telling you it's Albert. - And he hasn't been assassinated. - Bullshit. What do you know? You never go outside your bar. She made a call from here. Her old maid. Their line was out of order. Diphead, you think you know everything? - Slightly injury at the arm, she said. - Well, now he's dead. - Read the newspaper. - It hasn't arrived yet. - Did you bring one? - No? I gave mine to my wife. Then enough bullshit. His name is Daniel Dupont. And he's not dead. - The weather is cold today! - Yes! Here we are again. Maybe it will snow. At this time of the year it would be surprising. This is a nice house. Maybe. We see it everyday, we don't pay attention. - You're not from the neighbourhood. - True. I wanted to ask you the way to the police station. The police station? No trouble I hope. - No, I'm reporting a passing. - Oh. It's downtown. It's not easy to guide you from here. - It's like a labyrinth. - Just point the direction, I'll find out. Well take the stairs. And then... Just follow the slope and ask again downstairs. It's near the post office. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey guys! Say, I have riddle for you. - We know it already. Pour me another one. - Don't, you don't know it yet. Nobody knows it. Nobody, you hear me? The same for me, Boss. What animal... in the morning... Play with its zinzin? How funny! Excuse me, Sir. - Sir? - Hello, Madam. - The local newspaper please. - Gazette? Meuse? Wallonie? - All three. - Very well. - How much for the eraser? - May I see? No, it's what I need. Thank you. Don't you have special erasers for drawings? These are erasers for drawings, Sir. I wanted... something softer. Something more friable. The erasers from my childhood, do you remember? Everything changes Sir, even erasers. I'll try one. Very well, Sir. Thank you. - Is the post office this way? - Yes. But there's a small office there. It will open at 8, if you can wait. - I need a telegram. - Nothing serious I hope. No, no. What time is it please? My watch stopped working. - 7:30. - Thank you, Madam. What animal at noon... Here comes Jeanette. Hello! - Did you bring the newspaper? - Here it is. If you'll allow me. The government will assemble tomorrow. The fortune-teller was abusing her customers. Very serious accident on the road. Here it is! Saturday, October the 27th. A burglar broke into Mr Daniel Dupont's house. See? What did I tell you? Daniel! - Daniel! - It's not the same newspaper. Caught during his mischief, the malefactor shot several times at Mr Dupont. Badly injured, the victim had been transported in the neighborhood’s clinic, where he died without regaining consciousness. What did I tell you? Lies. The police is investigating the murderer. "Murderer"! For the moment, the inspectors have no lead. That's all. I read it. I don't believe it. These are lies. A slight injury on the arm! Come on, nobody can die so easily. I have a job for you. They sent a Special Agent, Wallas. He rented a room in the Allies Café on Surveyor Street. I want to know what he's doing. I'll be waiting for you... Very well, Minister. That's perfect. I was wrong thinking I was in charge of the security if this city. The central services already took the corpse from the clinic. And now they are sending a guy, Wallas. - He will do the investigations? - I don't know. They didn't mention his function. It's none of out business anymore. The capital is taking care of it. No more assassin. No more victim. - Closed case. - Should I give up on it? No... Who is it? Yeah? Okay, I'll wait. The guy the Minister sent. Do me a favour and watch him. Count on me, Captain. Have him come in. - Captain, I... - Don't bother. The Minister informed me. You are sent here to investigate the case, not in my place, but with my help. Well I have no lead, so you tell me what you're about to do. If this is not a secret. Thank you very much, Captain. I know the most relevant information, but I need some clarifications. May I know what the witnesses said? What witness? The doctor, the old maid... - Didn't the doctor call you? - Yes, he called the police around 9 PM. - Of course, you lifted fingerprints. - Of course. There were four sets. One from the maid and three more. Probably Dupont, the murderer and the doctor. If you wish, I can ask for the doctor's fingerprints. And the deceased's. - I would ask for them if... - If? If the corpse was in my possession. Don't you know? The corpse has been taken away. I thought it was the same service that sent you. You know, several services are working on this case. One more thing, the newspaper reported Dupont died without regaining consciousness. - This sounds strange. - It must be an error. He was not unconscious when the doctor arrived. He even declared he had not seen his aggressor's face. Are you sure Dupont is dead? Here is the death certificate the doctor sent. But it's true there is no mention of the injury that caused the death. If Dupont had committed suicide, it would be all the same. Do you know doctor Juard? War medal, National Order of Merit, Legion of Honor, Daniel Dupont was 55 years old. Teacher at a law school, he had written several books on political economics. Rich, high-profile and original. Very well doctor, thank you. Why would your report to the press mention "Died without regaining consciousness"? It was not my report. Still, it's regrettable. Even though Anna doesn't read the newspapers. As for the assassin, he will be happy to hear about my death. - You still refuse to inform the police? - Yes! We can trust nobody outside of the Group. The Minister said it himself. From now on, I shall pretend to be dead. - What time will they pick you up? - As soon as it's dark. Very well. Be prudent. The maid, Madam... Madam Smith. Her explanations are muddled. - Her telephone is out of order. - The inspectors did not insist. They have not told her her master is dead. I'll keep you informed if I learn something new. Which hotel are you staying at? I took a room in a Café on Surveyor Street, near the house. - Who suggested it? - Nobody, I found it by chance. Number 10. Is there a phone? Yes, I think so. Mr Wallas, please. Wallas? He left already. When? This morning. - What time this morning? - I don't know. - Haven't you seen him leave? - If I had, I'd know the hour. I suppose you don't know what time he'll be back. - What will you have? - Black coffee. There's no coffee at this hour. Well... I'll come back. This is not a hotel. No, he's just renting rooms. - Weird, he's not in our records. - See, your police is not so efficient. Say the assassin slept there, how would you know? The hotelier would have made a deposition just like he'll do with you. I want it before noon. What if he doesn't do it? Then you would be the first credible suspect in this case. A newcoming foreigner staying 100 meters away from the crime scene, and acting unbeknown to the police. I arrived yesterday at 11PM. I was far from here at the time the crime happened. Indeed. The best assassins always have an alibi. Do you have a revolver? - Yes. - What for? One never knows. True, one never knows. Will you allow me to see it please? One bullet is missing. Yes, I know. Give them the bullet you extracted. Say I was hit in the chest. Do you have any objection? No. You don't need me anymore, I'll go check the mother of a newborn. - I'll come back before I go downtown. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Mister. - Goodbye, Doctor. You trust this guy? Let's get back to the papers. I must take them with me tonight. Only you can help me. - Yes, but it's not safe. - For you, it is. You know they don't kill just anyone anywhere. That's why I need somebody out of the Group. - I know, but... - Go to my place before it's dark. Just after Anna leaves. It won't take more than 15 minutes. You'll barely need two briefcases. And you'll bring them here right away. - Will you go? - Yes. But just to please you. I don't want to look like I work for you. And your wife, does she know? The doctor will warn her, it will be better. I haven't seen her in a long time. She won't even want to see my dead body. - Do you know Dr Juard? - He's a gynecologist. Between us, his reputation is not great. - What is it, Sir? - I want to speak to the doctor. The doctor is out. But his wife is here. She always takes his appointments. I'm not a client. I need to see the doctor for a personal matter. - Do you know when he'll be back? - No, could you leave your business card? - No, he doesn't know my name. - You'll have to come back or call then. Goodbye, Sir. I sent you a death certificate, but I thought you may want to talk to me. And you were right, Doctor. Have a seat. Well I don't know what I can tell you about this weird crime. Why "weird"? I mean, uncommon. We don't often have crimes in our city, and... it's rare that a burglar... A burglar, you say? Did he steal something? No, not that I'm aware. If he did not then he was not a burglar. Don't play with words, Captain. - Probably that was he plan. - Oh, his plan? You're getting ahead of yourself. What do you want? Mrs Smith, aren't you? What did you say? Are you Mrs Smith? What do you need Mrs Smith for? Is it for the phone? - I'd like to talk to you. - I don't have time, I'm packing. - I only have a few questions. - I don't understand a thing. I'll come down. Come in, there is the door. The maid called you, right? Yes, old Anna. Weren't you surprised she called a gynecologist to heal a wounded man? Captain, please, I'm a surgeon too. Dupont knew that. We were old acquaintances. - Dupont was your friend? - No, we were just old acquaintances. The phone, we've been waiting a whole week for you to fix it. I bet you visited every café before you arrived here. Madam, this is a misunderstanding! I'm not here for the phone. You don't need to shout. I'm not deaf. - What is it about then? - It's about Professor Dupont. I'm an inspector. I have some questions to ask you. Again? This will never stop. You're the third. What do you want? The professor is dead. - Well I'd like to... - You want me to tell you who killed him? - You know who killed Dupont? - Dr Juard! - You said Dr Juard. - That's what I said, Son. Everybody knows he's an assassin. Ask anybody in the street. - Have you seen the aggressor? - He flew away like a bird. But the professor was alive, on the landing, I assure you. He told me: "This is nothing serious. Just call Dr Juard." And I went to call that damn doctor. You went alone to pick up the injured man? Yes, I don't have many employees. Anna and me just had to help him walk downstairs. The professor refused my help. When I arrived at the clinic this morning, I understood right away. Heart attack, he said, that angel. - I see no blood stain. - Of course, I cleaned it! It was such a pain the remove the stains from the carpet. And from the bed too, where he was when I came back after making the call. Blood stains don't go easily. Didn't you say yesterday he was unconscious? No, Captain, I never said so. When I arrived there, I talked to him. He even made some jokes. But once in the car, his health started to deteriorate. - Heart failure? - No. A bullet was inside his ventricle. His heart stopped when I extracted it. I did everything I could to revive him. How far was he shot from? Five meters. Maybe more. I brought the bullet. The bullet went right in the bull's-eye. Impressive for a fleeing burglar. Chance. Was there any other injury? No. Too bad nobody found the cartridge case. - Have the previous inspectors taken the Doctor's gun? - No. Do you think I'd let them empty the house? Come, it's still at its place. A bullet's missing. Did the professor shoot at the assassin? No. Mr Dupont came with his gun, but the other guy had already fled. Do you know if the professor had used it previously? Like what, Son? Do you think the professor was shooting in his own house just to have fun? With your approval, I'd like to take it for analysis. I'm not asking for a favour, this is evidence, you understand? You can take it, Son, who would use it now? Keep looking if you will. I'll keep packing. - You're leaving? - To the countryside, at my daughter's. - What about the investigation? - I won't stay here one more minute. - Maybe you could give me a spare key? - And now you want a key? Sir! Sir! Where are you? Here. How you frightened me! I turned on the light. There was light yesterday, it didn't prevent... Here. The key to the door you used to come in. - Lock it when you leave. - Thank you. I'm leaving, I have a train to catch. Don't let people say I left a mess behind. Everything is as clean as if nothing happened. Yes, the view from here is excellent. I thought with such a view you could have seen or heard something. No, I didn't notice anything. Any gunshot? Hurried footsteps, a slammed door? Don't ask too specific questions, you'll have me believe I witnessed the crime. Have you seen any prowler, that night or earlier that day? No Sir, nobody comes to this street. Somebody particularly interested in this house? I can't think of anybody. But... Who killed Mr Dupont? I don't know. A burglar probably. Oh. Yesterday, maybe I noticed something. I could see clearly, the night was falling. A man came to the railings. He took some little tool out of his pocket. Maybe pliers. Or a file. The man was wearing a raincoat, with a hat, a light hat. But you said you hadn't seen or heard anything. One's always reluctant to report somebody to the police. I'm not the only one who saw him. Hey, aren't you waiting for me? Hey, buddy! Hey! I have a riddle for you! You'll see, it's not difficult! Hey! Hey! Don't be in such a hurry! Hey! Don't go too fast! Hey! We'll find the answer! Hello. The weather's not hot this morning. Can I make a call? Hey, you made me run. Why didn't you want to talk to me yesterday? Who? Me? Oh, you think I didn't recognize you? He thinks I did recognize him. You know me? Yes, pal. And I think you were not very polite. It was just yesterday. - It must be a mistake. - A mistake? He says I'm a mistake! Me? A mistake? Where was it? At what time? Don't ask me the hour. The hour is never... the right time. It was not dark yet. It was there! Outside! Right there! Near the railings! - Yesterday at that time I was far away. - At what time? The time you mentioned. Well I didn't mention an hour. This round's on you. It's on me. It's on him! - Two white wine glasses! - Calm down, I'm not deaf. "Far away", you don't have a car. I took a train. He says he took a train. Let me laugh about your train. If you think I didn't recognize you, I recognized you. You just came out of here. We walked a bit and I saw you go to the post office. The post office? The small one, in the next street, downstairs. Also he tried to kill me. It would have been convenient. Wearing another coat is not enough. Hello? Immigration service? This is the Allies café, 10, Surveyors Street. I have a traveler here to report. His name is Wallas. W-A-LL-A-S. At least that's what he pretends. Only last night. The night before? You'll have to ask him. Anyway, I informed you. He tried to kill me. Tell them he tried to kill me! Shut up! I heard it was a burglar. But he didn't steal anything! It was in the newspaper. What could he have stolen? Old books? It is a political crime. The professor was part of the Committee. There are many persons in the Committee. Why Dupont? He was the one writing the manifesto. You can't see more than your little businesses. - You'll see, it's the mafia. - Why do you think so? I read it in The Tribune. This one today, tomorrow another one. The mafia has killed eight of them already. The mafia? It doesn't even exist! Hello? Dr. Juard please. I told you to turn off the light. Dupont came upstairs early. I didn't have to time. I'll go back. This time I'll turn off the light. - You have no order for tonight. - This is my business now. I'll kill him. You'll kill him? I swear. Don't swear, it's too late. - It's never too late? - Don't you read the press? It doesn't matter. I'll call again, thank you. Sir, somebody left a letter for you this morning. I almost didn't recognize you with this new coat. Well it's cold today. It's a good thing you came. It's probably not very important. Thank you, Miss. - But I only injured him. - He died, you were lucky. - Maybe the press is wrong. - Don't worry, I have my own informer. You killed him. So he is dead. And that Wallas, what is he doing now? He left the café at 8:00. You mean you lost him. How and when are we going to find him again now? Sir. Hello, Madam. You have a very strange sword. You think so? The picture is very interesting. Yes, it's a great picture. What can I do for you? - I need an eraser. - Okay. What kind? For pencils. But a soft and light one. Like this one? No, more friable. Maybe this one? No. This one is like... "bread crumb", if I may. I need an eraser that can easily be cut. And very smooth. As smooth as... mother-of-pearl. - I saw one at a friend's house. - Do you remember the brand? The brand was almost erased. There were maybe six letters. The letter in the middle was... an i. An i? - Are you sure? - Yes. Yes. I thought I could easily find a similar one. Well I have quite a big collection of erasers. This one should match your criterion. Not too soft. Not too hard. You'll see, it's a very good item. All my customers love it. Yes, I think this one will do. I'll call my wholesaler and ask if he has the i eraser. Thank you. If you could have the answer today it would be nice, I'll be around. Very well Sir, I'll call right away. - Do you sell pictures of the city? - Yes. And also paintings from the Museum. - Is this one from the museum? - This man? Yes, I think so? If it can raise your interest, I took some of them myself. This one, for example? For example. I'll take it too. How much do I owe you? It will be 20 Fr with the eraser. Thank you. This is a nice house, isn't it? Yeah... If you think so. Is this why you photographed it? Yes. Also. - Goodbye. See you later. - Goodbye Sir. "I confirm tonight's operation. Please remain available this afternoon." "G may fail." Let's not draw early conclusions, this letter proves nothing. Well it sounds like evidence. Orders to henchmen, explanations on ongoing operations, arms trafficking... Maybe it makes things too obvious. Maybe it proves you're the assassin. Dupont's gun is an essential item. You think so? Its caliber is exactly the same as the bullet Dr Juard gave me. Also, one bullet is missing from the cartridge. And finally, the revolver is jammed. What do you mean? I'm getting more and more confident that Dupont killed himself. What makes you believe in suicide? I don't know why he would commit suicide but that's the only option that fits the facts. Elaborate. The first bullet injured him. He couldn't shoot another one because the gun got jammed. Dupont took advantage of the maid's deafness to pretend there was a thief. Juard arrives and takes the injured man to look after him against his will. - What did the doctor say? - What Dupont told him to say. A child would know he was lying. Why do you prefer this camouflage over the assassination? Sir, I know your theory. Or maybe I should say the theory from the Minister that supposedly sent you. A ghost's soul in a political party's pay. Killers with an evasive plot. But with all due respect to my hierarchy... Dupont had a family and friends. We should question them. Family? Friends? None that came to our knowledge. - Only his wife. - He had a wife? Yes, much younger than him. I suppose she couldn't bear his hermit's personality. They broke up quickly. Why did you let me know earlier? You said it was a political assassination. She may be part of it. Sure, why not? Go and ask her what she was doing yesterday at 7:30 PM. She has a shop in Corinth Street, not far from here. This is the ninth case. Only the Minister makes such connections. I don't believe in that conspiracy. The central services took the corpse. I'll be pleased to let them have it and put it with the other eight. I wish them good luck. And to you too, Sir. - At what time do we meet the Bossière? - At two. What is it? Sir, what do you want? Don't shout, Captain. And don't call anybody. You would lose my testimony. I come for the death of that poor Dupont. Have a seat, Sir. I was with our poor friend until his last moment. And before he died, he entrusted me with a secret mission. Dear Captain, I will be assassinated tonight. What makes you think you will be ambushed in that house? The Doctor, Captain. Doctor Juard heard everything. Everything what? Dupont told me the importance of the files and what I should do with them. The Doctor was there. He left and called the gang to let their boss know. Come on, calm down. Have you heard what the doctor said? I didn't hear clearly. Only a few words. But these words were enough for me to follow their conversation. If you believe in that trap, just don't go there. It's easy for you to say. I haven't slept last night. You should have. And without a worry! There is no killer and no organization. Daniel Dupont committed suicide. - It's impossible. He told me... - He told you what he wanted. I'm sorry, that brand doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't matter, I need something else. Just after I left, it came to my mind you may be Daniel Dupont's ex-wife. It's true. He died last night. My condolences. Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered you about an eraser. Don't apologize. It was nothing. You wanted to ask me something? I have a confession to make. I am... A policeman? And you're investigating Daniel Dupont's death. Since this morning. I didn't know your identity this morning. It was a coincidence, believe me. What can I do for you? Thanks to you, I'd like to know Dupont better. Maybe his habits, his personality. Let's not stay here. The backroom will be more comfortable. Do you think Dupont may have committed suicide? Suicide? The doctor told me he had been injured. - That he died on the operating table. - That's one version. Captain Laurent thinks your husband has committed suicide. Daniel was not my husband anymore. We barely lived two years together. He wouldn't commit suicide. He would never. How can you be so sure? People say he was sad and lonely. Sad? That word doesn't suit him. How should I say? Boring? No, that's not it. I liked listening to him. What was unbearable was his loneliness. Definitely lonely. He wasn't made for marriage, or any kind of attachment. Why am I saying this? It's of no use for you. To the contrary. We need to know if suicide is plausible. Did he have a reason to do so? Could he do it without a reason? Absolutely not. Each of his actions had its own reason. His biggest mistake was thinking everybody was as rational as him. Maybe he could have changed as he was aging. I saw him again a few times. He was still the same. Happy? In his own way, yes. Far for suicidal thoughts, anyhow. To be honest, I don't believe in his suicide either. So he was killed. But why? Was anything stolen? Have you ever heard of some organization? You must be mistaken. How could Daniel be involved it this? He lived only for his work. I don't know what to say. When I heard about Daniel's death, I felt a weird feeling. To be honest, what's the difference between Daniel alive and Daniel dead? He was barely living. Do you have pictures of him? I have never seen him. A few, yes. But they are at my place. Thier-de-la-Fontaine, Upper Town. Near the clinic, if you know the place. I'll be there this afternoon. If you have the time... Number 7. Oh, the shop! Please give me a minute. Was I too long? Not at all. But I have an appointment at 2PM and I haven't eaten yet. Just one moment. - Do you know what he bought? - Who? The customer who was just here. I don't know. The postcard. The postcard of the house. The one you bought yourself this morning. What was he like? A man of your age. Modestly clothed. He was wearing a raincoat. Please allow me. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What's your name? Hélène. Hélène. So we haven't learned a thing. Only that the raincoat man is not from the neighbourhood. Now you're talking about killers and shady doctors. - Anything new about Dr Juard? - No. I can't reach him. He seems slippery. One more reason to insist. Should I make a call? The Doctor is waiting for you. I can take you there. With pleasure. Perfect. There are a few more things we need to talk about. Especially the report made by my inspector. We'll see this on the road. Another thing: this morning... you had barely left when a madmen came in here. Someone named Marchat. A former neighbour of Dupont. He talks nonsense like you. He says it's his turn now. That he will be killed tonight in Dupont's house, where he has to pick up some files. I wonder if he was acting. His mythomania, his terror may have been faked. First, Dr Juard and his suspicious explanations, now the visionary madman. I must point out that it's a young and naive inspector. He's a bit zealous. He thinks he has a new lead. Dupont didn't report his assassin, because he was too close to him. - What does that mean? - Here's the thing. He questioned a neighbour of the professor. He wrote in his report "A man worthy of trust. He's a guard at the museum." - He caught that night... - That night? Yes, a few days ago, the neighbour did not precise it. He reportedly overheard a heated discussion between Dupont and a much younger man. At some point, the young man sounded threatening. - Is that all. - Wait, there's more. After this discovery, the inspector questioned the owner of the Allies café. What did the guy say? Wait a minute. Dupont, thirty years ago, had a regular relationship with a modest young woman, and they ended up having a son. The professor tried everything he could for that thing not to happen. He then obstinately refused to marry the girl. And that son? The kid became a grown-up. He was visiting his father from time to time, probably to ask for money. Anyhow, it was giving rise to violent arguments the neighbourhood was frequently hearing. What do you think? Interesting. Maybe I borrow the report for a few hours? If you want. I only reported the most important things. Here you are. Thank you. See you soon. Let's keep in touch. - I have an appointment with the doctor. - Didn't you see him in that car? - I've never seen his face. - Don't get mad. He was called for an emergency. He may meet you at 4:30 PM downtown. - Downtown? Where? - Where you want. The doctor will call me soon. Well, let's say at the museum. - The museum? - In front of this painting. - He will understand. - He will? - Where is Thier-de-la-Fontaine? - First street on your left from here.. Thank you. - Hello Madam. - You're looking for Mr Marchat? Mr Marchat is Dr Dupont's friend, right? Has he heard? The poor man was devastated. Misfortunes never come alone. Mr Marchat just lost his father too. He left for a few days with his family. Excuse me, I'm not here for Mr Marchat. I need help. - Where is number seven? - Oh! This is the old garden's door. The house is up there, on the left. Thank you, Madam. Hello. You're here for the pictures? Well, maybe. Come in. I'll be coming downstairs. Have you had lunch? Yes, thank you. On the go, I'm used to it. - May I offer you a cup of coffee? - Only if you also drink one. It will just take a minute. Here is your coffee. I'm sure you won't refuse a piece of Rijstevlaai. - It's our local specialty. - Thank you. - This will remind me of my childhood. - Your childhood? I was born here. But I left the city so long ago I don't recognize it anymore. Yet it has barely changed. In this neighbourhood at least. I seldom came here. I was living near the university. Where were you living before you got married? On Mermaid Street. And your name was Hélène. I was born in Thebes. I lived there until I was 19. When my parents died, my uncle, who was an engineer, took me in. That's how I met Daniel. I was 20 years old. - Is this a picture from your wedding? - The only one. My uncle took it. - You were very pretty. - I was young. You are very pretty. It's strange, how your husband looks absent, distant from chimeras. You're right. I have always felt awkward near him. I felt I was suffocating. It prevented me from wanting to joke, laugh or sing. - Are these all pictures of you? - Yes, from my childhood. My teen years in Greece. You know the house on Surveyor Street. The dark and silent one. Caulked with carpets. Filled with old-fashioned items we were not allowed to touch. Passed the doorway, there was no joy in that house. Daniel felt comfortable there. He couldn't understand people could feel otherwise. He would never leave his study room. He would even spend a good part of the night there. - Do you have more pictures of him? - Only one. It's from before we got married. - Who's the child near him? - I don't know. Daniel never said a word about his years before our marriage. Do you think he may have had a son? I don't think so. I don't know. You seem fascinated by this view. I have indistinct souvenir of this place. Going down these stairs, I entered this door that is now bricked up. I was with my mother and we had come to visit a relative. Was he an uncle? A cousin? I don't remember. It must have been a long time ago then. I must have been six, maybe seven years old. It was a summer day, between two train trips. This door used to lead to the garden. But since I live here alone, I thought it was safer bricked up. More coffee? No, thanks. I'm sorry I must go. Dr Juard is waiting for me. Dr Juard? It's very close, you have time. We'll meet in the museum. The museum? It's weird. I heard it was the only way I could meet him. Is that really needed? What do you mean? Nothing. Don't thank me, your visit was a delight. Come back as soon as you wish. Will you come back? Captain! This was slipped under the door. It's says "Urgent and personal". The janitor didn't see who brought it? He didn't. He found it under his door, after you had left. Very well, thank you. - Hello. Do you remember me? - Yes, of course. I'd like to ask you a few questions. I had understood this morning you were from the police. I read the inspector's report. You overheard the professor talking to a much younger man. Yes, a few days ago. The window on the first floor was wide open. - I heard that visitor was worrying. - Worrying? - He was threatening the professor. - No, I said he was making big gestures. - You mentioned a dispute. - No, I said they were talking loudly. - Did you know that young man? - No and the professor closed the window. - And? - I think the inspector gives too much importance to this visit. Last question: I heard about a painting you have. Delvaux's Temple, I think. - Where can I see it? - Nowhere. It's in Paris for a few months. But if you're looking for Dr Juard, he's waiting for you in room B. In front of the great Picasso. Thank you. - Dr, I was waiting for you. - So was I. I had a tour and got a bit lost. You asked to talk to me. I remain available for the few minutes I have left. I know you're busy so I'll be quick. - It's about Dr Dupont's assassination. - I talked to the police already. Yes, I know the facts. The discovering of the assassin, the gunshot, the wound... - All we know is what you said. - I repeated what Daniel Dupont told me. - Are you sure he told the truth? - I have no reason to doubt his words. - Maybe Dupont tried to commit suicide. - No, impossible. - The shot was fired from afar. - How far? It's hard to give you a precise length. I'd say... Five or six meters. - He was shot full-face? - Yes. Between the fourth and the fifth rib. The shot was fired by a fleeing man, it was at point blank range. Dupont declared he couldn't see his aggressor's face. - Yet there was light in his study room. - He said he didn't know his face. - Were you Dupont's friend? - Let's say we're old acquaintances. - Why would anybody want him dead? - I can't find a reason. I was hoping the police would find. The police don't overlook any lead. But there is a lot to do. Sometimes you persist in tracking a murderer. - What do you mean? - Nothing. Excuse me but it's time. Goodbye Doctor. Excuse me Sir, if you really like paintings we have another Delveaux. Over there. - You frightened me! - Sorry, I made myself at home. - Is your arm fine? - Yes, very fine. - Fever? - So, I'm fine. You shouldn't exhaust yourself. He's not coming back. He'll arrive. He'd better hurry. You still have time. Not that much. So, in the end, we haven't learned anything. Only that my young inspector had the imagination of his age. A delirium. But he's not the only one. That Marchat, he may have fled. Yet, he will die tonight at 7:30 PM. Of auto-persuasion. Another example. This card was slipped under my door. The writing of a woman. Women like to send anonymous letters to the police. "Meet me tonight at 7:30 PM." But there is no place given. Maybe it's the place on the picture. Maybe. I can follow a diagonal path from the river and go straight to the point. - Not at all! - Let me speak! - You never stopped! - You don't get it. I can go straight to a point even if I draw a diagonal line. - It's relative to the river. - You will fall in the water. - You made me wait. - Please give me a glass of red wine. As friendly as ever. Say what you will, I won't go. An oblique line is still a straight line. - Be it in relation to a river or not. - And I'm telling you it's not! I'm never met anybody as dumb as this one. Have you heard that, Sir? A grown-up man, supposedly educated. He won't admit a line can be oblique and straight at the same time. Oblique has a double meaning. I know a good one. May I? Idiot, I bet you don't even know what oblique means. You are very oblique. Let me tell my riddle. I got one ready for my old pal. What animal is a parricide in the morning, incestuous at midday and a widower in the evening? Don't you know? It's rather easy. Parricide in the morning, blind at midday... No! Blind in the morning! Incestuous at midday and parricide in the evening! What animal? - I'll keep the room another night. - Is he paying his round? Hey buddy! Are you deaf? - Deaf at midday and blind in the evening! - Leave him alone! What? Oh, and it limps in the morning! - I asked you to leave him alone. - I'm not doing anything wrong. - I'm just telling a riddle. - Your riddles are fucking annoying. Meet me this evening at 7:30. He was married? Why didn't you tell me? You said it was a political assassination. She may be involved. No. If we can't find a murdered, then Dupont was not assassinated. It also appears he did not commit suicide. - So... - So? Active your Grey matter. Just think about it. Dupont is not dead. And I'm sure, you heard me? Sure! That he's hiding in Juard's clinic. Hello? There is nobody. - Good. I'd like to speak to the owner. - I'm the owner. Did Mr Wallas say what time he'd come back? He only said he will sleep here tonight. Thank you. I'll call again. - This is Dupont's house? - Yes. - You read the text? - What text? What's written on the back. - There's nothing written. - What do you mean "nothing"? - Call Dupont right now! - But... Find a way! Wallas took Marchat's place! Can't prevent death I'm happy I can talk to you. Laurent speaking. I found nothing! You'll never guess. You think so? What? Don't move, I'll be right there. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Let's go. Yes? Mr Wallas? He hasn't come back. Marchat told me everything. He told me he wouldn't go get the files. I know Daniel very well. I knew he would take them no matter what. I had a hunch it wasn't safe. Why didn't you tell me? It wasn't safe for you either. What will you do now? Go back. Make a report. Resign, probably. Don't leave like that. I'll bring some coffee. Here is your coffee. Who was living in this house before you? Nobody. What do you mean nobody? It belonged to Daniel. He was living here before your marriage. He gave it to me when we got separated. Why do you ask? No reason. - What did I say? - What did you say? Albert Dupont, dead. As he was walking home like every evening, Mr Albert Dupont! Look and tell me his name is not Albert and he is not dead. So? So?! So you'd better read until the end before you have a laugh. It's a different story! This one is a car getting out of control and running a pedestrian over. The van's driver then regained control and fled toward the harbor. You're delusional. You can't tell yesterday from the day before yesterday. You're gonna tell me a man named Dupont is killed everyday? There's more than one donkey on earth. Good morning. Do you have the invoice? Good morning. What was yesterday's riddle again? What animal...? What animal is black, can fly and has six legs? No. It was another one. Oedipus Is the train station this way? Yes. It's shorter if you take the big stairs. Hello? The owner? I am. It was a summer day, between two train trips. I was coming to visit my father. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG. Proofreading: flipflink
