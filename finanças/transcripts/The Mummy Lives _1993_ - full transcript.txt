[Woman] When the skies align again, thoth will await the return of his sweet love kia. He will appear again in the night's horizon, hoping she will accept his invitation to immortality.

Aquarius, the water bearer. Positive intellect strengthened by saturn and Mars. Pisces, the fishes, the struggle of the soul within the body, guided by Neptune and Jupiter. [Neigh] [Braying] [A different woman] After my father died, I just felt empty. John wanted marriage and commitment, but I knew I wasn't ready for that, so we drifted apart, broke up. He was mad, but I still just felt empty. From my father's will, I had a little money, so I thought, what the heck, I'll travel. First I went to London, then Amsterdam, but it wasn't until I got to Paris that I realized I really wanted to see Egypt. [Man] Oh, those bastards! Well, I told you to tell them it's not for sale! The man's a fool. He should've been horsewhipped. Right, I'm not happy. Excuses! No, don't give me that. You listen to me, sir. When I tell you to fire an editor, fire him. I don't care if he's the queen's first cousin! He's fired! I'm at the dig. I'll be here a couple of hours. I'm due to have dinner with the ambassador. We'll talk again later. Amateurs, amateurs. I'm surrounded by amateurs. Good morning, sir. It certainly is not. Oh. Couldn't get out of the damn house. Faxes and phone calls! Oh! I have to tell you, gentlemen, there's global interest in our activities here. My newsrooms in London and New York are begging for a headline. Hey, Peter. What progress? We are at the direct stage, lord Maxton. We are not sure, but-- but, but! That's what you've been telling me all this week. You know how much this circus is costing me? Not to mention my valuable time. Lord Maxton, we were out here before dawn. I should bloody well think so, Mr. Kroll. That's what I've been paying you for. [Shouting in arabic] What's going on? What's he jabbering about? Come here! Come here! Come here! Peter, get a move on. We will do it alone. Kroll, you were right. Absolutely right. [Maxton] Good show. It is here. The pyramids always drew me to them. That the entrances are aligned with stars is magical. Hidden passageways as mysterious diversions, and of course the elaborate farewell to the loved ones with the beautiful paintings and stories to guide one into the future. Why do I feel even the sky seems familiar to me? That even these children's voices sound as my own... Many years ago. [Tapping] [Maxton] Oh, it's about time. Come on. Come on. For Pete's sakes, don't tap it, hit it. Come on, man. Come on. Well? Anything? What's the delay? What is it? What is it? [Yelling in arabic] How did he get here so damn fast, this officious bastard? [Moans] Thank you. Good night. Thoth, command of me, thoth, demand of me, thoth, in thy praise, thoth, in thy ways, thoth, in my life, thoth, in my death. Thoth, may we give to you? Thoth, may we worship you? [Chanting om] Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth! Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. Thoth. [Chanting om] [Music plays] [Moaning] Kroll, did you bring the key? Yes, of course I brought the key. I don't want to be seen. Watch your step. How much time do you think we have? We only have three hours before the guards change. We must hurry. Be careful. Be careful. Come quietly. Quiet, everyone. House of bilad! Shh! House of bilad. Ali, are you sure there's no one lurking about? I don't want anymore trouble with that captain mahmoud. All the guards are inside. Just pay them some piasters. Your lookouts are still here? Yes. They are waiting. This could be one of the greatest finds in history. House of bilad. And the Maxton collection will get its due reward. Ha ha! Our friend at the department of antiquities could be of great help. Yes. With a chunk of cash money. I'll give you that. Just beautiful. [Hissing] By jove! We are not alone. This tomb is like no other. Look. The sacred symbol of thoth-- god of vengeance. Oh, yes. Their upper families dedicated their fairest daughters as his concubines. House of bilad! This is an evil place. Thoth is a jealous god. So would I be if I had a string of concubines. Whoever is in this tomb was buried in the "1,950 on the 7th day of the 35th decans." It's only the high priest. Wait. "The high priest aziru "is buried here "with 1,000 curses to guard thoth's treasure." Treasure? Go ahead, man. Read. "We will destroy all who desecrate this sacred precinct." We must not break the seal. Beware the eye of horus. Go and get your men. Lord Maxton. Ahh. Oh! Is this thoth? "For his terrible crime, "aziru was mummified "without having his entrails removed, condemned in body and spirit." My lord aziru. Beautiful kia. What a magical night. Come in. [Moaning] No. No. No. No. No. They're coming. N-no. No. Our wine. For you, my love. To you, my love. [Straining] Hold. I can't let you disturb these holy remains. Beware the curse. Hmmph! Holy. The inscription said he was a criminal. [Speaking arabic language] I think we should leave the mask until we have unwrapped the body. It's the most likely part to be decomposed. There isn't time to unwrap it. I don't want to be diplomatically embarrassed. I can slice right through the mummy's linen in one stroke. Go ahead, man. No, no. You must leave it alone. This is the one. Mmm. [Coughing] [Exclaiming] No physical damage. Extraordinary. [Kia laughing] When am I going to see this? Don't be impatient. It's nearly finished. Well? What are you doing? Leave her! She's innocent. She is thoth's concubine! She's only a child! Let her free. You've defiled her! Take me, not her! You will bring a curse upon the people. Thoth, forgive me. Thoth, forgive me. His stomach is contracted. I think he was buried alive. The contraction of the natron on the linen squeezed him to death like a boa constrictor. Huh. Charming way to die. Oh, my god! The sudden influx of the air causes expansion. [Footstep] What's that? Did you hear that? Listen. I don't hear anything. What's...this? The wind, lord Maxton. Yeah. No. It is the presence of the gods. In the name of thoth, god of vengeance, you, aziru, are condemned in body and spirit. You have defiled thoth's sacred concubine. You shall be buried alive-- never to be purified, never to pass into the great hereafter. You shall guard thoth's treasure for all eternity. Take him from our sight. I accept my destiny. Take this ring. Oh, my love. I will love you forever. I will always be yours. [Aziru] Thoth... I have transgressed. I stole the fairest flower... [High priest] In the name of thoth... Forgive me. God of vengeance... My love for you is greater than any monument man can design. You, aziru... These shrinking bands shall crush my life. Are condemned in body and spirit. I will die your humble servant. You have defiled... Let my death warn all others. Thoth, command of me. Thoth, demand of me. Thoth, in thy praise... Thoth, in thy ways... Thoth, in my life... Thoth, in my death... [Kia] Oh, my love. Thoth, may we give to thee. Thoth, we worship you. I will always be yours. [Weeping] Thoth! Thoth! Thoth! Thoth! Thoth! Thoth! Thoth! Shall we have a look at the head now? You. You do it. I think it's time to go. Ali. Cover it up. No, no, no, no. Professor. I'll do it. Me, I'll do it. Kia. Ah! House of bilad. Taxi! Taxi! That'd be great. Thank you. The pyramids always drew me to them. That the entrances are aligned with stars is magical. Hidden passageways as mysterious diversions, and, of course, the elaborate farewell to the loved ones. The beautiful paintings and stories to guide one into the future. You were loved and respected. You would be remembered. You were part of something large and lovely while you lived here. And once all the many layers are peeled back, once the stories have been etched into the outer layers of the sarcophagus and then removed, you're left with the ornate shell of a life, even wearing the rings and necklaces that once were part of a breathing day. Far away from the insulated walls of the pyramid, a dry, hot Sandy breeze, pouring water and looking into the eyes of your loved one and seeing that spark of recognition that you and he are alive and that anything is possible. [Guttural moan] [Thunder] Take this ring. I will love you forever. I will always be yours. [Alarm rings] Put that down, miss. Put it down. [Speaking arabic language] Get the police. Yes, sir. Thoth... O, mighty thoth, god of vengeance, restore me to flesh and blood. Thoth, command of me. [Speaking arabic language] Barnes. Sandra Barnes. I feel so foolish. I'm not mental. I--i just... I don't know, blacked out. Go back to your hotel, try to relax. I can prescribe a sedative. Oh, no, thanks. My hand hardly hurts. It isn't your hand I'm worried about. The authorities have waived all the charges, but you could be smashing glass cases again. We don't want that, do we? Who's "we"? Carey. Dr. Carey Williams. I'm here with the world health organization. Well, you turn out a neat bandage, doctor. First aid's not my thing, though. I'm a psychiatrist. I work mostly with kids. There are no bats in my belfry. All I'm suffering from is embarrassment. Professor hashim said you didn't know where you were. What compelled you to come down here? Nothing compelled me. I'm interested in egyptology. I'm going to Luxor to see the new dig. That's the one lead by the newspaper magnate lord Maxton. Yeah. I was thinking about going down there myself. You think Maxton needs his head examined? Could be. Listen, if you have any more problems, give me a call. Sure. Miss Barnes. Enjoy the rest of your stay, and, uh, take care. Thank you. It's a great honor, Mr. Ahmahdi, to lead the head of the Egyptian department of antiquities into this sacred place where no living man has trodden in 3,000 years. It is well, sir, that the tomb has not been entered. You have no right to anything in it. I think I must disagree with lord Maxton. There has never been a tomb in this valley that has not been robbed or broken into in some way. I agree with professor alexatos. Look. Who is she? Goddess of gods. Kroll. Ja. You know them all. I thought I did, but this one... Ah! She moved. She is moving. My god. Not your god, lord Maxton. Who are you, sir? I'm doctor riyahd Abdul mohassid. How did you get in here? Ask these eminent gentlemen. They say this is the first time they've entered the tomb. This is no more your first time than it is mine. Perhaps you are referring to when we put in the steel door. Ja. that must be it. I supervised the installation, but I don't recall seeing you. I was there. Excuse me, sir. The room you came from... I suggest you read the inscription before you enter. "I am the protector of the dead. "Those who defile this sacred place will die." I'm going in anyway. "I am the protector of the dead." This is extraordinary. O, mein gott! Gott in himmel! Oh! Who is this? Corporal fousi, one of my men. He was a grave robber. So he was the first one to enter the tomb. And he was the first to die. I am the protector of the dead. No. No. Kia... Go away. Kia... Don't. Stop. Go away. Kia... Aah! Stop! Kia! Aah! Dr. Williams. This is Sandra Barnes. Remember? Yeah. Hah! Come on. Come on. Hah! Hah! All right. It's great out here, isn't it? Beautiful. Sure I'm not going too fast for you? I'm fine. Good. How's that horse? Great. She's a good one. She's a beauty. Whoo. This sure beats a psychiatrist's couch. I thought the change of scenery might be therapeutic. Strictly professional. You ride well. Oh, thanks. You, too. Thanks. So, this trip to Egypt, been planning it a long time, or was it a sudden impulse? Am I back on the couch? Just interested, that's all. So the doctor's interested, huh? Well, my dad died a while back. I inherited the business, sold up, and took off. Was Egypt your first stop? No. London, Paris... But, yeah, I guess I was headed here all along. Easy, boy, easy. Sandra, freeze! Don't move. Back slowly. Slowly. I'm with you, doc. Well, it's not exactly the hard rock, is it? No, but down there the nile flows on as it has for thousands of years. I can almost see it and feel it just as it was all that time ago. When you were back home, did you have scary dreams then, too? Oh, here comes the man in the white coat again. What's that you've got behind your back? A straitjacket for me. I am just an interested party. Yeah. You said that before. The only way you're going to get rid of these nightmares is to understand what's causing them. Maybe I did have them once in a while. I was into this Egypt thing. How bad were they? They were kind of mixed up. I was worried about my dad. And after he died... Don't you ever give up? O.k. Session's over. Come here. I want to ask you something. What? Do you know how beautiful you are? Now, that's better. O, mighty thoth, I, your humble servant aziru, shall purge this land of the unholy plunderers of our graves. [Awk] A gentleman to see you, sir. I hope I'm not intruding. Not at all, Dr. Mohassid. Please, come in. May I offer you some tea? I abstain from tea. An Egyptian not drinking tea? Beer was the national drink of old Egypt, and the best beer came from Memphis. You sound as though you drank it. Well, I know the ancient recipe. Fascinating. You know, the best scholarship today considers wine to have been the favorite drink of the people. They are mistaken. The only good wine was in the pharaoh's court, a vintage called balm of the heart. How would you know that? If you look at the inscription at the bottom of the wine amphora, it says "balm's heart." I never cared for it myself. The wine. No. The name. Dr. Mohassid, we are all most impressed with you. We are curious to know how you entered the tomb without anybody knowing. I am the protector of the dead. "I am the protector of the dead"? Hmm. Dr. Mohassid, we are civilized men. This is the 20th century. [Squawking] Sorry. One moment. [Wings flapping] Dr. Mohassid... This place is great. You know, it's over 2,000 years old. Wow. This is really something. It sure is. Oh, I'd love something like that. Uh-huh. How much is that? This one? It is, uh, good. How much is it? It is, uh...$20. 5. No. It is good. Come on, I'll give you 5. 1o. 1o. 10. 5. 8. 8. O.k. [Speaking arabic language] Please leave me alone. Please leave me alone. I'm sorry. Sandra! Sandra! Sandra! [Laughing] [Jabbering] [Moaning] And kia shall return to aziru as Jupiter aligns with Mars. Who are you? Is this a dream? You've had a nap. Perhaps you were dreaming... But you're safe now. My purse. Of course. Yes, of course. If she calls in, please tell her I'm at the hotel. Sandra, where have you been? Lost, I guess. For eight hours? Holy cow. You're referring to shu, the goddess of the sky-- the holy cow. What? This gentleman rescued me. Well, I appreciate that very much. My pleasure. I don't even know your name. Mohassid. Dr. Mohassid, miss Barnes. How do you know my name? You told me. When you told me where you're staying. Did you say you were a doctor, an md? I practiced medicine for many years, but, these days, I would be considered old-fashioned. My principal interest is antiquities. I have a passion for them, even though I'm one myself. An antique has to be at least 100 years old. Ah, well, I try not to look my age. Sorry. I should've introduced you. This is Dr. Williams. He's a psychiatrist. I guess you have those here, too. There's very little in the modern world we Egyptians did not have 3,000 years ago. I will take my leave. I will see you in Luxor. Luxor? You live there? Yes. I will see you there. Salaam and good night. Strange guy. Where'd you find him? He found me. I like him. Well, he's got some problems. He was afraid to be touched. He wouldn't even shake my hand. You're the one with problems. I need some rest. [Thunder] Thoth, command of me. Thoth, demand of me. Thoth, in thy praise... Thoth, in thy ways... Thoth, in my life... Thoth, in my death... [Yowl] Sandra! What are you doing here? Are you o.K.? Carey? Thank god, it's you. What's happening to me? I knew you'd be at the museum. I knew you'd be here. It was so strange. I saw the weirdest things. One of your dreams. No. It was real. Then show us what happened. Uh-uh. I can't. Sandra, he's right. Come. We're with you. Nothing to worry about. Come along. My favorite figure in the museum. The most beautiful woman in all of Egypt. Who is she? A whore of one of the gods. You are so like her. Is this the stuff you said got smashed? Looks pretty normal to me. But it...It did. It did burst open. [Mohassid] Thoth, command of me. Thoth, demand of me. Thoth, in thy grace. Thoth, in thy ways. Thoth, in my life. Thoth, in my death. Sandra, this business about the sarcophagus is just a manifestation of death anxiety. It's becoming hard to tell where the dreams end and reality begins. That's verging on psychosis. Look, you've recently lost a central figure in your life-- your father. Death anxiety invades both the conscious-- what we consider reality-- and the subconscious, where we dream. In a sense, your dream was a rational thought. The two men were your father and your imagined lover. These longings cause you guilt. That is such crap. Guilt is suffocation. Didn't you say that your dreams usually end in suffocation? Yes. It's bitter medicine, but if you can live with it, you might get rid of those nightmares. That must be Maxton, the newspaper magnate with Dr. Mohassid. That mohassid sure gets around. Yeah. That's him, all right. Looks like they're headed into the tomb. Why is he with them? Allow me. Kroll says it's a medicine chest. What's your opinion, doctor? It's a perfume box. I beg to differ. The cat is one of the forms assumed by bast, goddess of health. Obviously, it's a medicine chest. Bast was a variety of wild cats that beheaded serpents. This is a domesticated cat, and this box would sit in someone's boudoir. How do you know that, Dr. Mohassid? By the protruding tongue. It was a private joke between the young pharaoh and his bride. They were referring to an ancient proverb that said, "the tongue is the best and the worst thing in the world." What nonsense. Ha ha ha! Read the inscriptions. Pleasure. "A tongue... "Is the best... And the worst--" I know all the great egyptologists, but you're a phenomenon. I'm giving a cocktail party this evening. Can you join us? It would be my pleasure. I've reached an agreement with the antiquity service. The contents of the tomb will go to the museum. Have a last look, if you like. You're most kind. Grave robber. Goodbye, doctor. He's dead! The curse, I'm afraid. What happened? He's dead. Dr. Mohassid was here. He's... Well, you're as lovely and charming as one of the dancing girls of the gods. Thank you. Lord Maxton won't mind you bringing us? Lord Maxton won't mind anything. I'm surprised he didn't cancel after what happened. Well, lord Maxton has no respect for the dead, ancient or otherwise. Respect's a two-way street. I'm sure the dead don't think that much of him. Curse of the tomb, my eye! Dr. Ahmahdi's death was an accident. A most regrettable one. Most upsetting. Indeed. But innocent, too, after the death of corporal fousi. Somehow entered the tomb despite your steel door? The guy was a grave robber. Probably was killed by an accomplice or something. Good evening. Mahmoud. You listened to lord Maxton. He knows everything. He's one of the great grave robbers of our time. I resent that, sir. I spent a bloody good fortune in this country, doing important scientific and historical research. You dig up my ancestors. You Rob us of all of our treasures. You take the remains of my people and put them in glass cases in museums, so people can look at them like circus freaks. You call that research? Dr. Mohassid, we are operating under license of the Egyptian government. Then I shall go to the British government and ask for a license to Rob westminster Abbey. We're here because you buggers don't know anything about conducting a scientific dig. You Rob, pillage, rape, steal all of my country's artifacts. You and people like yourself take away the honor of Egypt. Get out. Get out of my house! Get out of my tombs. Get out of Egypt. Lord Maxton... He's mad. There's no way we'll look at the tomb now. Might as well go back to Cairo. Miss Barnes, there's nothing in the world that will keep me from showing you the tombs. Please. Did I ever tell you about the time when I was a boy, how I used to play at the temple's entrance? I met this old man... Better get some sleep tonight. Yeah. I need it. If I have another night-- I'll be right next door. Strange thing is, I like it here. It's like I've been here before, and I know that I haven't. How do you explain that? Oh, no. I won't get into that again. The last time you asked me that, remember what happened? There's a thing called genetic memory. We all go back to ancient times. Prehistoric, even, I guess. And? And... And you shouldn't be in Egypt right now. Let's go back to Cairo. We can plan a trip to the Greek isles or Rome. No. I want to see the tomb. Mohassid said he could take us. He's got you buffaloed, but all right. We'll stay another day, and then we go, o.K.? Maybe. I'll see. You're a sweet guy. Good night, doc. [Aziru] My lord thoth, your vengeance will be continued in the Blaze of the sun. The criminals will meet their gruesome fate. I have gained kia's trust. She will cast off her mortal suitor, which will leave her unprotected. All these things I have set in motion. [Thunder] Please help! Help! Please help me! Please! Miss Barnes. Come in. You look so pale. Pale? Dr. Mohassid, you don't know what's happening to me. I know everything that's happening to you. Come with me. I want you to sleep here... In my bed. I shall sleep under the stars. There. I'm so tired. I'm so tired, I could die. Sleep. Sleep. [Growling] Kia! Aah! Sandra! Sandra! Sandra! Sandra! Oh, my god. He was there... Right beside me... This...thing. Tell me about the dream later. It wasn't a dream. It was real. No matter what happens, it's o.K. It's only a dream. It can't hurt you. Try to relax. I'll get you a sedative. I'll be right back. Very interesting. What do you know about this new head of the antiquities department? He's tougher than the other one. But I think some of this must disappear. The sooner, the better. Quite so, Mr. Kroll. Quite so. Let's go and have lunch. These damn officials. I'm sure they could've been bought like the others. Salaam, lord Maxton. What are you doing here? Please forgive my behavior last night. I was not myself. Thank you, Dr. Mohassid. I accept your apology. You're most kind. I don't bear grudges. Therefore, I've brought you a gift. I bought you this beautiful cat. Please accept it from me. Oh, thank you. It comes from a long line of cats that were buried with the pharaohs. It may be even a reincarnation of one. Thank you, Dr. Mohassid. I admit I'm more of a dog man. I see. I hope you enjoy it. Salaam. Thank you. Well, I'll be damned. Heh heh heh. Take a look at it, kroll. [Meow] [Meow] Aah! My eyes! I'm blind! Aah! I can't see! Get me a doctor! God, help me! I can't see! O great god thoth. Hear... Hear my humble voice. Give me more time so that I may avenge... The robbers of our graves. Avenge the robbers of my grave... And return the girl! Give me one good reason why you should stay. I'll tell you why you won't go. Mohassid. I feel kind of drawn to him. You think he can end your dreams? He can also start them. He might put you in a dream you don't come out of. I think you're jealous. I'm not leaving. Period. There's a bus to Cairo in a couple hours. Guess I'll be on it. I think you should be on that bus, too. Look, you must know by now how I feel about you. Please come with me. No. [Groaning] Good evening, lord Maxton. You. You! I've come to say goodbye. Aah! Aah! Goodbye. Dr. Mohassid's here. You. How did you get in here? I've come to pay my last respects. Lord Maxton is dead. [Thunder] Leave this land, gentlemen. Leave while you still have time, for this is the land of thoth. My god! Thoth kills. [Dr. Williams] Why won't she listen to me? It's as if she's obsessed. There's just so much going on with her right now. Maybe she needs to be alone. This doesn't feel right. And where the hell does this Dr. Mohassid fit in? I know she feels drawn to him. But I don't trust that garbage he keeps feeding her. Like that stuff about... "And geb layith with the goddess Mayotte in a close embrace. "But ra was displeased and ordered shu to separate them. "With their separation, "space and light were created. "All the stars and planets were born of their union. "Every 3,300 years, they are brought together again." Beautiful. Beautiful. Would you like to see the observatory? Oh, I'd love to. Two nights from now, Mayotte will return to geb's arms. In order to do that, Mayotte must move backwards. They believed that the gods can make the planets go backwards? But they do go backwards. Or at least, that's what it looks like. Modern terms would call it retrograde motion. You know a lot about astronomy. Well, we Egyptians have astronomy in our blood. All of our temples were built for astronomical observations. And that's how you know where geb and Mayotte get together every 3,000 years. And then but for a few moments. But within those precious moments, they are stationary in the sky. The night of the embrace. The night of the embrace. If lost lovers are reunited, in those few moments, the gods will allow them to return to paradise, where they will live in divine ecstasy. That's a tall order. The gods have powers. You really believe that. Does that seem so strange? Why must modern civilization fear anything that isn't based on science? With science, there is no passion. Without passion, there is no life. I sense in you a... A great passion. Please. Take this ring. How strange. I've seen one just like it. It's been in my family for countless generations. Oh, Dr. Mohassid, I couldn't accept it. I want you to have it. It's very beautiful, but no, really, I couldn't. Perhaps some other time. Please. [Mohassid] Behold the heavens from where the ancients still watch over us. On magical nights, you can see the gods. [Sandra] Oh, really? That's great. Yes. Tomorrow is such a magical night. On the trip back to Cairo, I worried about Sandra. Dr. Mohassid made me feel she was in danger. I went to the museum to see if I could find any answers. Ancients believed that mummified spirits could be reunited in the flesh... The night of the embrace. Ancient tombs. Mars and Jupiter at the present-day site of Luxor. [Mohassid] Sandra... You walk among the old temples of beauty belonging to the very ground you once graced. Kia, my sweet love, my heart's desire so long ago, and now again. We were both born for this moment in time together. Your heart's sweet, knowing and loving of me. You are drawn back to me here, and I to you. Even though I still love you, I will not make the same mistake twice. I will carry you in my arms to thoth. You will rule with him forever. Then I will be able to gain back his trust. As jackals guard your temple, I am your slave. I am devoted to you, great thoth. Did she say when she would be back? O.k., o.K. Yeah, thank you. Damn. No miss Barnes? No. You know, I should've never left her alone. Is that the ring that... Miss Barnes took out of the display? Yes, it is. The ancients believed it contained the life-force of thoth. His concubines could not enter paradise without such a ring. And this? That is the great high priest aziru and his beloved kia. It is one of the saddest of the legends. The fragment was found in the temple of karnak. Be careful, Dr. Williams. What did you say this guy's name was? The high priest aziru. What is the legend? Aziru was caught making love to kia, one of thoth's sacred concubines. He was buried alive. What happened to kia? According to legend, she reunites with aziru on the night of embrace. The night of what? Embrace. It occurs every few thousand years when the planets are in a certain conjunction. And this is aziru. Nadi, thanks. I got to go. I just know Dr. Mohassid's got some plan for Sandra. He's convinced that she's a reincarnated goddess. And now she's down there by herself. I've got to help her. Overnight to Luxor. [Horn honks] Grave robber! Aah! Prepare to meet your destiny... And join your friends in hell! You're insane, doctor. Please. Anything you want. It's yours. Please! Oh, you're too kind. But I have everything I need here. My embalming instruments. For example, this is used to free your soul. But in this case, I shall use it... To shut your mouth. Now, the embalming instructions should be of interest to a dedicated but soon to be dead grave robber like yourself. Huh? First... First you take a chisel, and you insert it into the nostril, thus. Break through into the brain, one quick twist. Then the teka. The teka is used to cut the brain into little bits and pieces by twirling and twisting this instrument. Ah! Then... At last... The mumbus, which is inserted, and slowly, you extract all the bits and pieces. Ah! Any questions? This is a night-- good. No questions. Oh, and not to worry. Your looks won't be lost. They don't take ugly people into paradise. Believe it. [Knock on door] Hello? Yes. Who's there? Hello? Hmm. "Sandra, please come immediately." You're all right. I thought you were ill. The message said to come at once. There was a misunderstanding. But I'm fine, and we had a date. Don't you remember? It's the middle of the night. Yes... But it's the night of the embrace, when Jupiter and Mars meet. We said we'd watch it together. Don't you remember? Oh, yes. I've calculated the exact time of the embrace. Time enough. What is it? A wine. You've had it before. I have? When we first met. I guess I was too much of a wreck to remember. It seems like such a long time ago. A very long time ago. [Speaking arabic language] Damn! Perfect. Perfect. What's going on? It's all right. Yes. Who's that? You're dreaming. Dreaming. All is prepared. Kia. She'll be there. I'm bringing her. Kia. Come. Take this drink. No. I don't want it. Come. The gods await. Destiny beckons. She ran through the lobby and into the street. But where did she go? One does not ask a guest, especially a lady after midnight. What about the concierge? Does he know? He went home after the storm began. Was she here when miss Barnes left? [Speaking arabic language] A black limousine came to collect her. I'm getting the police. [Aziru] The cycle is unbroken. The stars light the path to heaven. Your hour of eternity is here. O great thoth, god of all joy, it is the night of the embrace, and I return your favorite concubine to you. [Thoth] Prepare her! Kia! If your office felt the same way about Dr. Mohassid, why isn't he under investigation? I don't know. Sandra's not at her hotel. Mohassid's not at home. Doesn't prove anything. I know he has her in there! Let's get into that tomb. If he touches her, I swear I'll kill him. Come on! Let's go! Look. The gate's open. Someone has pulled the trigger. It's a damn cave-in. Tombs were built to keep robbers out. Chutes full of rocks, secret passages. I can't believe this. Your soul shall be liberated. Your body shall be a house that you can return to without death. A life of eternity. Your life is soon over. But with thoth, you will reign forever. Shh! Someone's coming. Take cover. Kill the light. [Speaking arabic language] Stop. Ali? The killer of fousi? No. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I came to search for a few things like the others. Whoa! Take it easy. [Speaking arabic language] Watch out! Aah! What the hell's down there? I'm going to go in. Are you all right? Follow me. Be careful. She's got to be down here somewhere. Come on. [Thoth] The time has come. It is here. The sacred embrace. The gods have kept their vow. Off to the left. A sacred linen. I... I know you're going to kill me. I am but thoth's instrument. I return you to him. Aah! Aah! Aah! There she is! Shoot him! Sandra, come on! Quick! Get out before the doors close! Let's go! Give me your hand! Come on! Keep moving! Come on. We got to keep going! Run! Wait! Come on. Keep moving. Straight ahead! Wait for me! Watch that ceiling. It's going to come down. Keep running, Sandra. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Keep running! [Hiss] Stop! Whoa! Watch out! O.k., go. Come on. Ali! Give me your hand. Aah! Aah! Aah! No! No! Aah! No! No! Come on. You're all right.
