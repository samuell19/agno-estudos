The signal was coded and sent at 02:10, mean standard, Saturday, October 5, of last year. It was received and logged at 03:18 that same day. And the signal was logged as? I'm sorry. The priority rating of the signal. Priority EM13. That was the flash report. The incident report was subrated medical request EM15. Rated 1-3 1-5. So this was urgent. Yes. And when the officer of the day brought you the message... I ordered us offline at 03:36 and memoed Biochem. They had about half the stuff... the medication on board... and could synthesize the rest by the time we reached our launch window. And would you tell us exactly the nature of the medication? Altanine, a recombinant viral vaccine. They needed 63 units and a load of antibiotics to help hold down the fungal growth. Fungus? There were fungus problems on LC10? Yes. Fungus problems similar to those experienced three years ago in the J Group mining system? Yes. And would you like to remind us of the outcome of that epidemic? Many men died. Where are you taking me? Deck 6 is impassible at the center line. Too much condensation again. This is the wrong way. It's a shortcut. We'll cut through D hold. D hold? D hold's full of tourists. No, it's not, not any more. They moved 900 head out of there this morning because of the condensation. D hold's going to be completely empty. Empty? That's good, Mitch. Great. Great idea. I thought it was going to be empty. Excuse us. Look at this. They're shunning water again. Tell me, why can't they just blow it into outer space? They got to recycle it. Oh, yeah, hey, they got to recycle it so they can give it back to these people to drink and relieve themselves of it all over again. Yeah, well, better them than me. - Do you ever drink bush water? - Course not. I work for a living. Oh, look at this. Hello. Excuse us. Let's... let's go the other way. Let's go back. - No, no, no. My drop's in a half an hour. That gives you plenty of time to change your mind. Mitch, it's not a voluntary drop, OK? Regulation section 79, sub three... all emergency missions considered mandatory at the discretion of the captain. - I know. I know. So develop some sudden disability. I'm going. Hey, you know where you're going. You're going to LC10, mining colony. You know what? It's frozen hell there. There's no relief shift for eight months. You're going to sit around with nothing to do. One word, Mitch... captain's orders. You know what, John, you're a lemming... a lemming. That is what you are, John. You know, Lieutenant. I know, Lieutenant. Excuse me, we're having a private conversation here. Yeah, whatever. I think we need a little revolution around here, you know? I mean, why do we always have to go right where they point? Mitch, it's a rescue mission. It's high profile. When I get back, I'm getting a promotion. You can count on it. I'm going to outrank you. If the captain hadn't given me this, I'd have begged him. Uh-huh, well, I think begging's against regulations. Only if you grovel. At 03:43, I logged in orders to the navigational officer, and sent a maintenance crew down to the flight deck, instructed my flight commander to send in EDS. An EDS is a... Emergency dispatch ship. They're lightweight one-way vehicles, disposable. Computer does most of the flying. My ship carries 10 of them. I sent a human down to tell a pilot to pick up his orders. And he was? - The pilot? - Yes, sir. Barton, John Barton. skip loader pilot, second lieutenant. Good pilot? I thought so. Hmm. Barton transferred to the Saratoga two and a half years ago. File says he owns some options, was part of our profit sharing plan. Did he want this mission? Yes, definitely. Why? I think because it would look good on a resume, would weigh in heavily at promotion time. And until the time in question, you considered Barton a good officer. Absolutely. Why? Because he followed orders. Aw, I can't believe they make people live in here. It's the price they pay to get where they're going. You know, somebody's got to pay for better ventilation. You could always ask them to stop breathing. What door do we need? Well, the one all the way down there. Come on, we got to change your clothes. These are brand new boots. Uh. I calculated fuel consumption on your regular weight and, whoa, what have you been eating? Soy meal, same as you. And you're one to talk. Yeah, well, I'm the one who has to fly the kite, and I know you pretty well. Unbelievable. Mitch, it's my reader. It's 2 pounds. It's regulation. What do you think, they give you this paper flight suit because it makes you look good? You were probably sick that day at flight school. But there's this whole thing about, you know, enough fuel to get to the planet, no excess weight... Gardner, take this to my quarters. What am I supposed to read down there for eight months? I don't know. You wanted the gig... suffer. I want that thing back. No, you're not going to get it back. When did you learn how to read, anyway? Much better. See? OK. Coordinates are set, and you got 17 minutes to jump out. So take care of yourself. I want it back. Oh, Yeah. Eight months... dream about me. EDS 34 G11, I need a confirm on this test. Well, that goes for EDS. You are clean and green for item one, so check it down. OK, I have inertial guidance. Right. I have a primary computer. Right. I have backup computer, and I'm enslaving ignition sequence now. OK, that goes forward. We're taking our feet from the bridge. Buddy, you've got 11 seconds to jump out, so I'm going to swing out your item two, that is item beta. And I'm going to give you a mark here at 7, 6, 5, autoignition engage. I turn on your pretty lights, and don't forget to write. Whoa. Saratoga, I have guidance break. Repeat... IG break... Hey, we got a problem. ...reads, uh... I can't see the numbers, Mitch. John, hold on. Um, John, switch your computer over to auto-IGS. All right, that's better. I have pitch stabilized at 93 mark 4%. Uh, what was that, Mitch? I have no idea. Somebody must have sneezed on your.. Should I reset? No, no, you're fine. We're tracking you good. You didn't burn up any fuel. I'm very sorry for your tumble. Forward that. I'm going to run a diagnostic. Big Sara, you copy? Yeah, come back, 10. I've got a funny here... telemetry error, comp alert ID 319er. That's impossible. What does it mean? It means you're too heavy, but I checked that payload myself. Hey, maybe you got a lurky. You know, prep could have left a vacuum cleaner or something on board. You think? This flight crew? Yeah, I think. Uh, why don't you go find it, and boot it, and get back to me, OK? OK. OK, you got me. Hi. - Come out of there. - What? Get out! Get out! All right. All right. You're not going to arrest me, are you? I mean, I'm willing to pay the fine or whatever. What are you doing here? Oh, I guess it's obvious. I'm catching a ride. You can't. Well, whatever. We're going to have to make the best of it. Saratoga, I have a problem. Yeah, John, come back. My name's Lee. I have a situation. What kind of situation? Is it going to be a long trip? A stowaway. What did you say? I have a stowaway. She's a colonist, a girl. I don't know how she... Mitch, what do I do? I have no idea. I think you ought to get a flash report upstairs. I'm burning fuel out here. Yeah. Yeah, that goes forward. Yes, sir. I need bridgecon stat. Never mind, I'm going to go do it myself. So what are you going to do? Ask for help. Don't be stupid. They're not going to help. You're kind of stuck with me. Stupid. I'm stupid? You have no idea what's happening. Yes, I do. I'm here, and it's against the rules, and don't be such a pain. I said I'd pay the fine. There is no fine. It's more serious than that. Look, I'm not scared of you. You think I care about your orders? I'm NC cargo. Nothing is worse than that. What are you doing here? You're kidding, right? I mean, I saw you on the ship, so I know you saw where I had to live. Do I need more of a reason to get out of there? Yeah, you do. I'm going to LC 10. It's a mining colony, worst pit on the frontier. Nobody wants to go. Yeah? Well, I do. Why? My brother's there. I got to see him. Well, prepare to be disappointed. We're not going. Wait, what do you mean, not going? Just what I said. This ship can't go to LC 10 with you on board. What, they won't let us land? No, we can't land. Your weight wasn't figured in when we launched. If we try to land, we'll run out of fuel and burn up in the atmosphere. I am not going back. You can't go back. We don't have the fuel. It's what we call a fundamental design constraint. We could die out here. Well, what are you going to do? Going to I ask for help. EDS 34 G11. - Hey, wait. - It's me. Hey, buddy. Listen, we got us a situation here... you know, a firestorm of proper channels. Every suit in the ship is standing in a circle, calculating trajectory, duel, time loss. Well, Mitch, get them out of this conference mode, OK? This thing only gets worse by the minute. Buddy, you don't have to tell me. Listen the captain's going to come down here and talk to you himself. He is? Yeah. Give me the girl's name and ID number. Hey, let go! Let go! 8-5-2-2-7-Zulu-Zulu-tango. Marilyn Lee Cross. My name is Lee! All right. All right, sit tight. I'll call you when the captain gets here. Over. So why are they keeping us hanging out here? I mean, what's there to discuss? - Protocol. Proper channels. You said we could die out here. Yeah. Well, call him back. Tell him to get with it. Hey, there's procedure, OK? You spent your life on Earth. You wouldn't know. But out here, a misstep can get somebody killed. Yeah, and that's us if they don't hurry up. Look, dropping a freighter back into black space is a big deal. You have to take an engine offline. It's dangerous. Well, I am really, really sorry, but let's get on with it, OK? Because it's not like they got a choice. It's expensive. EDS John. Hey, uh, buddy, I'm going to put the captain on. Listen, we've got to do this formally. I'm sorry. That's OK. What? What's he saying? OK, I'm spooling the disk. Lieutenant Barton, do you consent to this recording as an official transcription of orders issued pursuant to corporate regulations section 41, subsection 1 beta? Yes, I do. John, we received your distress call at 07:03. Is that when you first noticed your passenger? Uh, approximately one minute before that. OK. At 07:02, that's when you noticed the passenger. Mitch, I recommend we cut through the papers here. I'm burning gas out of here. Tell him to hurry up. John, everyone's aware of the situation up here, all right? I just need you to calm down. Don't make any waves. - What does that mean? - Let me just... Let me just put the captain on. Lieutenant Barton, I want to say for the record, I feel very badly about all this. We've made every effort to salvage your situation. Thank you, sir. I've consulted the engineers, the flight director, and the board of representatives. But I'm afraid there are no options. Sir? Your orders are to make the necessary adjustments, and complete your drop. Complete my drop, sir? How? You are to normalize your weight differential. I don't understand. What don't you understand? How can I complete my drop, sir? Listen, John, it's a bad situation all the way around, but I can't change the laws of physics. You're going to have to put the girl off. She's still alive, sir. I'm not sure that was clear. I know that. Yes, I'm sorry. But there are no practicable options. We have solid legal precedent. You will not be liable. But sir, in this extreme situation, couldn't you come back for us? It's not an option. I have a schedule to maintain. The girl brought this on herself. It's a bad situation. I understand that. But sir, maybe there's another ship in the vicinity or... No, it's the first thing we checked. Don't you think we checked it? Now listen, Barton. I've issued you your orders. I feel very badly. We all do. But you are to correct the anomaly by 07:24. Reserved fuel will be sufficient if you are within the weight envelope by that time. You have eleven minutes, son. Do you understand and agree to follow the orders with which you have been charged? Barton? Lieutenant Barton? Yes, I do. Confirmed. Logged 07:13, 5 October. So when's the company coming to get us? They're not. What? He said I have to put the girl off. What? Put me off? Yeah. So I'm supposed to float out there in some kind of suit, right? I mean, until someone comes and picks me up. There is no suit. No, no, wait. Wait, if you make me leave the ship, I'll die. I know. So... so you're saying you're just going to put me off the ship with no suit? Like this? Naked? You're just going to toss me away? It's not like that. They'd come back for us if they could. There's just no choice. Oh my God. You want to do it. I don't. Look at what you're doing. You did this to yourself. This is why the flight deck is restricted, why NC isn't allowed, why there are signs, keep out. All I did was go somewhere I wasn't supposed to. I didn't hurt anybody. Look, try not to think about... let's just... What are you doing? Don't make this hard. Trying to get the execution over with as soon as possible? It's not my decision. No, but you're going to carry it out, right? I have to. Do you really think I'm just going to walk off? Huh? You're acting like there is nothing out there, like I'm going out the door to grandma's. But there is nothing out there... no light, no air. You can't pretend that... You still don't understand. No, I understand, but I don't accept it. They say this. You say that. And I'm supposed to smile and say, oh, I see. Sorry for the inconvenience. Well, I don't see. And I'm not going to let you kill me, because that's what it is. You're standing there hoping to murder me. There's nothing I can do. No, no, no, no, no. You listen to me. I am not worthless, and I am not going in there. So you're going to have to kill me first or drag me kicking and screaming, because I'm not going in there. Saratoga, this is EDS 34 G11. Hey, John, how you doing? Mitch, look, I want you to give me access to... There was some bad business out there, buddy, but don't worry about. Nobody up here blames you. It's not your fault. Just put it behind you. Make your drop. Mitch, I want you to give me access to your guidance computer. What for? I want to calculate my reserve, cut back on my deceleration, burn for as long as I can. Clear the deck. You didn't do yet, did you? Look, I'm going to... it's going to get done. John, that was a direct order they gave you. You got to do it. They're going to think that your disobeying the order. Mitch, OK. I just need time. We have to do what they tell us to do. I feel bad for this girl. I do. I feel bad for her. You're not the one out here looking at her. No, and I'm not going to pay the price. Now, they will cut us both down because of this. I just want to recalculate my entry vector. The captain gave you a direct order. I... what are you thinking? You cannot override your guidance program without authorization. You know that. Just log me onto the Sara's computer, will you? No. I'm not asking you to break any rules. No, you're asking me to help you break the rules. It's the same thing. I can do it on my own box. The onboard computer's not configured to do that. Then give me the access! I will not. - Fine, I'm reconfiguring. - John, don't do that. What do you think about this? They're going to tag you with this for life. John. John. What are you doing to do? I'm going to try to help you. Damn. What? I have to disable the safeties. Well, is that bad? Considering the safeties make sure we can't crash, yeah. What... what... what... what did you do? I'm... I'm... I'm lighter. Am I lighter? I cut back the engines. It should give you a little time. - I think I'm going to be sick. - Toilet's that way. Take a left. You all right? Yeah. Yeah. Damn it. You do know what you're doing, right? Do you want to try? No. OK. I'm going to use up the reserve fuel. Gonna run the engines on low while you're on board to save gas. Run him up to the top just before I land. That should give you a little time, not much. 40 minutes. - 40 minutes? - Best I can do. That's it. - 40 minutes? What is that? I thought you were going to help me. There's only so much I can do. We're outside the weight envelope. I've done the math. I can't make the lines come together. Yeah, and I'm NC, hardly worth saving. I mean, why even try, right? I have tried, but I have orders, and I bent them too far already. I told you already, I don't care about your orders. Would you go if they told you? Hmm? Would you salute them, and thank them for a wonderful career, and just walk right off? This isn't about me. You hate us, same as everybody else. I don't like you. As a group, you mill around with no ambition to get up out of your own filth. But that's not the point. I'm on a medical supply mission. What about the people on the planet? They need this drug. You do not know what it is like to be out of options. We're not so different. I couldn't always see I had anywhere to go. Don't you ever compare me to you. I am not going to let you do it. I'm not going to let you push me off. Then we both die. So that's it, hmm? You resigned yourself to murdering me. I would do something if I could. Would you? Yes. Then you think. You think. Something, anything. Damn it. So say something. What are you doing? I'm trying to recut our course, figure out a better route, maybe save enough fuel to... So what's it telling you? Not much. This computer's not designed to plot guidance. Well... is... is that good? No, it's not. This is not going to work. Let me try something else. Uh. Maybe it'll tell us how overweighted we are. OK. That's you. I have to put in your weight. Did you ever do algebra? Yeah. OK, well, you're x. All right. Ship runs out of fuel here, accelerates towards the planet, hits the surface here. No good. OK, that said, it looks like we're 46.31 grams too heavy, about 101 pounds. Well, that's less than I weigh. It's 'cause I'm using the reserve. And if I weighed less still, say... say... say 50 pounds, I could stay longer, right? Well, yeah. But I can't weigh less, at least not significantly less. No, you'd have to... So there has to be something else on the ship that we can dump to lighten it, besides me. There is nothing. This ship is mainly spun plastic. They build them cheap; recycle the controls, the air lock; leave the rest wherever it lands. It's disposable, one trip. Mhm. So what's your cargo? What is it? Medical supplies. How do you know? I was told. Yeah? Well, let's find out. Don't touch it. Things got to weigh as much as me, easy. No. What? You can't move it? I can't dump it. Why, what is it? I don't know. It's so important I have to die, and you don't know what it is? It doesn't matter. I think it does. I think if it's not important, we can dump it, and they can send more. You don't know that. They don't send an EDS when people have the flu. They send it when people are going to die. Whatever it is, it's needed. End of story. Yeah? Well, let's take a look, shall we? Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Get back. Stop. Let go. Stop it! All right. All right. Stop it! You stay there. I'll look. Go ahead. Look. Altaniasis, OK? That's J fever. I knew a guy who worked in the J mines. He died of it. You hear me? It's fatal. Get off. Get off. Let go. No, I'm not going to let you touch it. You can say I overpowered you. I knocked you out. It's going out the door. No, you cannot put other people's lives in danger. Pull out. Ah! Uh. Ugh. Ugh. Aw. No. Stop. Please. I'm not going to stop. No. Don't. Get up. I'll help you, OK? If we find anything else, we can toss it out. But we can't touch the medicine. Oh, that's heavy. Oh, I guess every bit counts. This isn't going to work. I want you to understand that. There's no way I can take 100 pounds out of here. Hey. You're just trying shut me up, keep me quiet till it's time, till you can get a drop on me. What is it with you? I'm doing the best I can. I want to be sure you're going to try. What do you want me to do? Well, you can find something heavy. Whatever possessed you to get on this ship in the first place? You ever try living for five months in a septic tank with 600 other people, eating next to them, breathing next to them, sleeping next to them, watching them get sick, have babies, fall apart, and die? It is no better down there. Maybe not, but I won't be alone. You weren't alone on the Saratoga, so that's not why you stowed away. I told you why. I wanted to see my brother, Adrian. I was living in that cesspool. And miracle of miracles, you were taking a ship, and you were going my way. I just figured I'd come along for the ride. How did you get on board? Saratoga's an old ship, infested. You got NC-like rats in crawlways you've never seen... ducts, ventilation shafts. They never leave the ship. So you found a shaft, and crawled through, and stowed away. Uh-huh. All this just to see your brother? Yeah. Why couldn't you have picked something less dangerous? Because I couldn't. I mean, it's not like I knew this would happen. Hey, what was that? That was our stuff hitting the door on the way out. So how much did we lose? - About 35 pounds. - How much time? Looks like 57, 58... looks like they give us a little less than an hour. OK, so every 40 pounds is an hour. Looks like. Well, we get two more loads like that and we're there. Listen. What? The sound... you don't hear it? Well, sure, I hear it. You don't have to put your ear up to the... No. No, not that sound. There's another one in the background. Like whispering, like a pulse, almost as if it were a living thing. Living? Yeah, but it's different now. Different after you changed the engines. Different after we threw the stuff out. But somehow it's still the same, like a person yelling, whispering, a little out of breath maybe, but still with a distinct voice. Come here. Listen. No, Thanks. Come on. I mean, you don't know I'm wrong unless you try. Come here. Put your ear right up against it. Nothing. Haven't you ever thought that objects respond to you? You know, just a little. No. Keep listening. Let it happen. Stop thinking. Obviously, I already have. See, I told you. I told you so. Hey, what is that? What is what? The wall. What are the walls lined with? Insulation. It's a polymer. It's light. Even if we took it off, it wouldn't weigh enough. You know that for sure? If we took the insulation out of the whole ship, it wouldn't weigh 10 pounds. So just stand there, and watch. You said you were going to help me, and all you do is argue. You want me to die. I can accept that. I don't want you to die. Have you ever thought about it? About what it's like to kill another human being? No. You know, you could've put me out when you talked to your captain. I thought maybe if had some time, you might accept things. So much for acceptance. Ah, damn it! Ow. I'm... I'm sorry I keep fighting with you. It's OK. Tell me something? What? Anything. Anything about you. I thought this mission would get me a promotion. Why would you think that? Oh, you know, straight and narrow, service above and beyond... that sort of thing. Story of your life, isn't it? Not my whole life. When I was 15, I hopped a shuttle to Mars. Really? You stowed away? I hid in a shipment of beer. They didn't find me for a week. Well, what happened? They sent me home on the next ship. My parents paid a huge fine. My father... my father said I was on my own after that. He figured he'd done his bit, paid all the bills he was going to. Said having a kid didn't mean he had to pay the freight forever. I learned to respect regulations. You know, my whole life I've... I've done everything wrong, but this is the first time I ever really got myself in trouble. Are you scared? No, not anymore. I mean, I know I'm scared, but I don't feel scared. I guess it's the nature of the human mind... denial, you know? I mean, I think if I really thought I was going to die, I'd just pee all over my feet. You know what my brother used to tell me? Every choice you make is the right one, no matter what. Every door you open has possibilities. Every crisis is an opportunity. You can't take any wrong turns in life. I wonder what he'd say about this. No. No. I've seen you. I've seen you all. You do the quartermaster for a blanket. You do the mess chief for extra rations. I never did that. I never let anybody touch me. Guys I work with, they go down to the cargo decks. They do things, not me. I didn't do this because I want anything from you. You think you're going to get me to toss my cargo and my career aside for that? No. No. You smug son of a bitch. You think you know everything, don't you? I don't want anything from you. I'd rather go out the damn door. This is it. That's absolutely all there is. So you can't say that I didn't... uh... You too. - Looks like 16 pounds. - Well, that's almost 60. That's just over 50, not even a half. Well, you didn't think we'd get this far. We just got to keep going. See, I'm good at making things work. Now, the next thing we should do... You still don't understand, do you? You don't understand. There is nothing left. Look. Look. We've got less than an hour, and there is nothing left to throw out. Why do you keep doing this? I'm sorry. What? What is it? What's so funny? You all right? I'm OK. I'm OK. I was... I was thinking about a really funny story. Do you want to hear it? I guess. OK. So the pope is on a state trip, right? And his chauffeur is driving him. And the pope leans forward to the chauffeur. And he says, do you mind if I drive? The chauffeur says, no, because it's the pope. So he... the... the... the chauffeur lets the pope drive. And... and he's... he's taking corners on two wheels and flying through stop signs. And sure enough, he gets pulled over by a cop. And he says, did I do something wrong, officer? And, uh, the cop says, excuse me, your eminence. I mean, it's the pope, right? So the cop freaks. So he goes back to the dispatcher, and he says, what do I do? I just pulled over someone really important. And the dispatcher says, well, how important? And he says, well, you know, important important. And the dispatcher says, well, is it the mayor? And he goes, no, more important than that. And the dispatcher says, what, is it the governor? And he says, no, more important than that. He goes, well... well, who is it? And... and the cop says... I'm not exactly sure, but the pope is his driver. Oh. I've heard it. Oh my god. Yeah, you know, I think I... I'm sorry, but I'm not the one going out that door. John. John, John, John. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. John, no. No. No! No! I need to talk to my brother! You got to let me call my brother! You got... call my brother! You have to let me call my brother! No! John. John. You let me out of here. John, you got to let me out of here. Son of a bitch. You don't have an hour. I'm going to let you call your brother. But I'm not going to turn my back. And if you twitch, I'll kill you and toss you out. OK. I swear I will. I promise, John. Do not promise! I don't believe a word you say. Get out. Get out! Could you help me? Get out. Ow. - Sit there. - I'll stand. Sit! Hailing ground station LC 10, this is Echo Delta Sierra, 34 G11. Do you copy? Hailing ground station LC 10, this is Echo Delta Sierra, 34 G11, do you copy? Come in, EDS 34 G11. This is ground control 039. Do you copy? That goes forward. Ground station, can you please... Signal is weak. You're going to have to wait a minute till you're completely in range. What happened? Sit down. Sit. What happened? We're not completely in range yet. Well, will I be able to talk to him? You just wait a second? OK, try it now. Just wait. - OK, now. - What's his name? Did you tell me his name? Adrian. EDS 34G11 hailing ground station LC 10. Do you copy? We got you EDS. Uh, ground station, I need to talk to an Adrian Cross. Satellite tracking shows you off course by vector heading 34 mark 8. Please, can you get me Adrian Cross? Oh, sure. You know, he's out by the pool, having a drink. Do you want me to send a bellboy? - It's an emergency. - All right. All right. Just a second. Cross. Cross. Oh, he's out surveying with a team near the Sea of Despair. It's not on my chart. It's the single advantage of this job. We get to name things. Look, tell him to get to any transmit point and call me ASAP. That goes forward, but I don't know if he's going to make it back in time. Sun's setting. We're going to become dark in a while. Well, it's an emergency, so get somebody on it. Yeah, they're doing it. Now, we've got your new drop window in about three hours, but you're going to overshoot the pad. It's going to take us a day to get to you. Yeah, I've had guidance problems. I had to scrub my original IG program. Listen, how long can you hold out? Oh, we're OK. If you're having problems, we can delay. Do you want to wait? No, I can't do that. I'll call you later with drop numbers, but I need to talk to Cross. We'll be in contact. Over. So what, they can't transmit after sunset? It's the rotation of the planet. The base goes over the horizon. We can't hear them. They can't hear us. Uh, it's almost dark in their area. Looks like about two hours, so I wouldn't worry about it. That's more time than you have. Nice. Can't we just, um... No, we can't. And don't ask me for anything else. I'm not going to help you. So what am I supposed to do? You wait quietly until he calls. And whether he calls or not, at 9:25, it's goodnight, Irene. Charming You're welcome. John? How much time? 25 minutes. Go back to the bunk. You'll hear it when he calls. If he calls. You'll hear. Can we please talk? I mean, I... I can't just sit there waiting. You know, it's like I have this clock ticking in my head. I don't want to talk. I have nothing to say to you. You tried to kill me. Well, now you know how it feels. I'm sorry. I mean, I know you don't care, but I am. Fine. I never tried to kill anybody before. Me neither. I guess it's sort of funny if you think about it. You think that was funny? Well, it was original. I mean, my whole life I've made the same mistakes over and over. You know, I just repeat them. A lot of people do. My mom, she just got married. She just got married for the fourth time. This guy... Russell. My dad's been married twice. Minute I saw him, I knew she was going to marry him. How'd you know that? His eyes. Her first husband, the one she really loved, he died before I was born. But his eyes, they were, uh... they were pink. Pink? Yeah. Well, not the pupils. They were brown. But the white around it was pink, bright pink, bloodshot, like, all the time. And then later, all her husbands had the same pink eyes, same big clumsy bones. He was kind of scary. Why? Truthfully, made me think I was fated from birth to marry a pink-eyed man. 'Cause you know what, I'm just like my mom. We're the same as two squirrels. Every time I think of her sleeping next to that awful man, I just want to scream, you know? Would you say something? You're just trying to get to know me so I feel bad when I have to... Do you want to feel good about it? No. So go ahead. I don't know what to say. Anything. Is there very much in your life you regret? What, you mean like getting on this ship? No, I mean, like, things you did and... you knew what you were doing when you did them, and you knew why. And you thought you were right, but later you wish you hadn't done them. Maybe because you learned something or just because you find you think differently later on. I wish I'd taken better care of my teeth. I have eight fillings, eight fillings. I hate my smile. When I lived in Cincinnati, I... I found a wallet on the street once. Had ID and everything inside. Belonged to a fellow who lived in my building. Saw him in the elevator almost every day. Almost every day I saw him in the elevator. I knew him. But I kept the wallet. No, I threw the wallet away. I kept the money. It was only $71. So what happened? Well, I felt sorry. So what did you do? I started using the stairs. Hey, what is that? There's something out there. Are we this far already? What is it? Heliopause. We're passing through gases from the edge of the LC system. Kind of like a solar wind. The static from the ship makes it glow. Huh. It's pretty. You know, up until now, my whole life has been getting ready to live. I always said to myself, after I do this, that's when I'll start to live. A lot of people think that way. I know I do. But you can't divide things in half forever, can you? I mean, how many people can say they're alive right now? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know either. I've seen pictures of people who died in space. What happens to a person's body when they go out there? Your lungs will decompress. The oxygen will want to go out to fill the vacuum. The absence of pressure will cause your blood to, uh, sort of boil. And the cold will freeze it solid at the same time. It won't last longer than a split second. I don't think it will be painful. Promise me something. When I go out there, don't look through that window. Don't look at me, no matter what. What was that? Nothing. We've used up the oxygen in the first tank. It's just shunting over to the... Lieutenant, at this point, had Barton tried to contact the Saratoga to get approval for any of this? The stripping of the insulation? The jettisoning of various parts of the ship? No, he hadn't. What was the next piece of information you received? The EDS was still feeding us drop numbers. Lieutenant Barton had... had disconnected his own communication. But there was an automatic feed link to the flight recorder and big Sara, which is a computer on our ship that displays thrust numbers, bearing, fuel consumption, stuff like that. At 09:16, we received the comp alert that there was an oxygen system malfunction on the EDS. And was this in fact the case? Yes and no. We found out later, Barton himself made the system malfunction. Why would he do that? He was attempting to jettison an O2 tank. He needed it pressurized to remove it from the ship. But the computer will not release a pressurized tank, so he had to hot-wire it. Mhm. And, uh, how would he do that? Well, sir, I have no idea. I imagine that he would have looked at the electrical schematic in his computer. Mhm. Lieutenant, why do you think Barton failed to contact the Saratoga? He must've needed help, technical advice. He was insulating himself. Perhaps he was, uh, trying to minimize his infractions. Well, had you threatened him? Pushed him away? Led him to believe he was on his own? No, I was working with him. So you're telling us you were cooperating... No... ...helping him break regulations. No, sir. You have understand, at this point, Barton and I, we were friends. I didn't want to see him throw away his career. I was guiding him. I was helping him. I was trying to get him to follow his standing order. I see. Let's go back to the malfunction. How would jettisoning an O2 tank help Barton? Just like everything else he was doing, it would buy him some time. K. In the back, there should be a gray junction box. You see it? No. Should be eight wires and black in the center. OK, I got it. All right, we're going to have to cross-connect that circuit. Can you reach it? Nope. Well, you have to. Well, give me a boost. Ow! Ow! What's wrong? - Aw, I got shocked. - Well, be careful. There are a live terminals up there. Yeah, no kidding. Thanks for the tip. Ow! Damn! - I said, be careful. - Shut up. I am being careful. OK. OK, I got it. OK, good. Now, one of the input wires is red. Do you see it? Yeah. It's connected in two spots? Yeah, I see it. I see it. Good. You have to pull that out and hook it in with the yellow and the orange. OK. OK. OK, wait. Hold on. Let me get to the screen. All right, I have to vent the tank. Then you bypass the sensor, all right? It has to be draining when we release it, or it's not going anywhere. I'll tell you when. OK, the tank is about 200 psi takes maybe 15 seconds for it to drain. That means you have less than that to rig the thing. So be ready with that wire. I'm ready. What do you think I'm going to do, drop it? OK, do it now. Aw! Damn, thing's hot! Oh, no. It didn't work. What's wrong? What's wrong? Just a second. Hurry up! The pressure's dropping. We got to make the computer think it's zero before it is zero! Hurry up! Come on. Come on. Come on! We're losing it! Come on! If we don't drop it now, it's never going to get dropped! Come on! What are you doing? What are you doing? Come on! Ow! You did it! You did it! 15 pounds. That's 15 pounds. Thank god. Thank god. Thank god. Ow! God! Would you get me the hell out of here? OK, you get your choice. Beef and broccoli, macaroni and cheese, or meat loaf. I'm not hungry. Well, give it a try. Well, I'm a vegetarian. Macaroni and cheese it is. I'm not eating it. Look, I'm hungry, and I don't want to eat alone. So just try it, will you? Fine. Hey, it heats up. Yeah, you're supposed to mix it with water first, but we... we dumped the water, so... Look. Lovely. It's good. You didn't say it was good. Well, the food they gave you on the Saratoga must have been awful. Oh my god. You wouldn't believe it. Hey, how much does this weigh? Less than a pound. Eat up. It's getting cold in here. No insulation. Don't worry though. It'll heat up plenty when we enter the atmosphere. Can you, uh... can you turn the heat up? Well, it's on. Well, it doesn't feel like it. What? This thing must weigh at least 50 pounds. EDS 34G11 going out on y band. Mitch, do you read me? Hey, you really screwed us, buddy. Mitch, can I remove the heat exchanger? - What? - The climate control. Just tell me. John, why didn't you just boot the girl? Why do you think? Barton, you got to... Mitch, look, I don't have the structural schematics on my box. I need you to look them up for me. No, I'm not going to do it. If I access the files, it'll show up on the computer log. You know that. They'll accuse me of breaking orders. But you're the one who wanted to buck the system, a little revolution, remember? Here's your chance. What you're asking me to do is not revolution. You are asking for mutiny. It's not mutiny. As long as I complete my drop, it's a minor infraction. Minor? Do you have any idea what's been going on up here? The captain gave you a direct... Mitch, I'm in a real bind here. Please, just look up the specs! I do not have to. You cannot remove it. Why? How do you know that? Well, Lieutenant, I know, because I watch them repair it. And they do it on the ship. If they could take it out, I would have seen it. But you don't know. John, listen to me. You are out of time. Do you hear me, Lieutenant? We are out of time. You have to boot the girl. I'll decide when I'm going to do it. That's insubordination. - Yes. - Fine. Then you know what you are, Johnny? You're a dumb bastard. And when they come asking about this, I'm not going to help you. Do you hear me? I'm not going to help you! I'm sure you won't. Ugh. OK. Aw, I could really use a pliers. Yeah, well, if we had any, we threw them out. Well, I think I can get it to... Ow. Ooh. Why don't you try turning it? Shut up. Well, maybe it'll unscrew. OK. Whoa. Whoa. I think it's broken now. Hey, John? Mm? If this comes out, I can stay. Can't I? All the way to the bottom. I could see Adrian. I wouldn't have to worry about the radio. You could kiss him on the cheek. John, if you get this out, I will do anything. I'll... I'll get a job. I'll... I'll give you all my money. I'll introduce you to a girl. Who says I need one? John, if anyone ever needed a girlfriend, it's you. You don't know that. Yes, I do. I can't get it out. It's permanent. It's not coming out of there. Are you, uh... are you sure? It's not going anywhere. And there's nothing else? No. I'm sorry. How long can I... wait for Adrian? Ah! Here you go. Come on. Hold still. Hold still. I got to stop the bleeding. Just hold still. Get the first aid kit. We threw it out. Oh god. Oh god. OK, OK, OK. OK. Ah! OK, OK, OK. Ah! Just hold still! Ah! It's all right. It's all right. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. All right. All right. Just lie there. You're going to be fine. You're going be fine. How do you feel? Not good. Does it hurt? I'm sorry. We say that a lot to each other. Yeah, and it probably won't be the last time. I left Earth, because I couldn't tell the difference between myself and anyone else. I felt like if I didn't do something, I would just... I know. I know. It's like that. People, they move out of the cities, and the cities keep right on chasing them down. I learned to conform to everything around me. So what do you want? I thought maybe I'd find out out here. I guess you can't get away from what you carry around with you. Are you trying to get away from yourself? All I know is, until today I still couldn't see much of a difference between myself and anyone else. I'm not... not trying... I mean, I don't... I don't want anything. I believe you. Do I get a last request? You had about a dozen. Where are you going? What... what are you looking for? Remember when we talked to LC 10? We told them we were going to be late... Yeah? They didn't care. They said, be late, delay if we had to. Yeah, but we can't... Listen. Think. If it were an emergency, if people were going to die... Then we couldn't be late. Stand back. Take that to the chair. Did you ruin the medicine? No, the medicine's fine. I ruined my career, but the medicine's fine. What are you trying to find? Information. Liars. What? What? It's not medicine? It's not medicine, not for an emergency. It's a vaccine. It's to inoculate the miners. Well, that... that's medicine. They're not sick yet. It's a fungus in the mines. They found the fungus, obviously. But they haven't exposed anyone yet. With this stuff they can... they can keep working. They don't lose any production time. So they're not going to die? Not if they don't go in the mines. Well... well... well, let's get it the hell out of here. Can you pull? I am pulling. Wait. Wait. You... you said this is to inoculate them. You said they're not sick yet. - They don't go in. They don't get sick. - No, they will go in. They will. They'll make them. You know what it's like. They don't have to. They will make them. What, you think the corporation's going to wait, hmm? You think they're going to strike? They're alive. They don't have to die. If we do this... you know if we do this, people will die. I don't know that. Why'd it say that? Well, I must've punched it in wrong. - John. - Don't worry. It can't be right. The medicine weighed more than enough. Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. I'll reconfigure. There has to be some old data stuck in here somewhere. - It keeps saying... - I know. It's wrong. But why does it keep saying that? I don't know. We had too much weight, and now we don't? We're lighter than we should be. Right, than it shouldn't be saying that. It doesn't matter what it says. We can land. I mean, it's not a... Not a what? Geometrical. What? It's a geometrical equation. What does that mean? It means we've waited too long. Our math is two hours old. We... we didn't recheck it. We... we needed to run another simulation. Did you make a mistake? No, not then I didn't. So how is it different now? When I figured out how much we had to lose, that was for then. If we had lost that then, we'd have been OK. What... what... what difference does it make? We've been burning fuel this whole time. But with your extra weight, we haven't been slowing down as much as we should. The longer we waited, the more fuel we needed to burn. And so as time passed... No, that's wrong. We have more than two hours. We have more than two hours, and we'll be on the ground by then, because every 40 pounds is an hour! That was hours ago. If we lost 40 pounds now, that might give us 10 minutes. John, please. Please. I don't... I don't understand what you're saying. If a car begins rolling downhill, you can stop it with one finger, if you do it soon enough. But if it gets going, builds momentum, it'll run you over. You need more and more force to stop it. For us, that force is fuel. And to have enough fuel, we still need to be lighter. By how much? 80 pounds. Oh my god. Soon it'll be 100, then more. We're back to where we started. John. John, I need to talk to Adrian. This is Eastern Station going out at 945. Are you forward? Eastern Station. This is EDS 34 G11. Do you read? This is Cross. Hi. Lee? Adrian. Where are you? I'm on the EDS. Are you OK? What are you doing on that ship? Adrian, there's a problem. I can't stay. What do you mean? If I stay, the ship will crash. I don't have time to tell you this, OK? I stowed away. I... I wanted... You stowed away? What were you... I can't believe it. Adrian, we have to talk now. And we have to make it fast, OK? So can we just talk? Well, of course, sis. I need to tell you something. I want you to go on. I want you to go on, and work hard, and get married, and be happy, OK? I can't believe it. What... there's no way? No, we tried everything. We dumped the cargo. And John... he's the pilot. He dumped his cargo to try to save me. He's in really big trouble. Adrian, you don't ever go into the mines, do you? - Sometimes. - Don't. Don't. There's no vaccine. Don't let anybody go in there. People will get sick if they go in the mine, so just believe me, OK? I believe you. I'm going to be OK. I don't want you to beat yourself up about this. I'll be fine. Let's... let's not... Adrian, we're never going to get another chance, OK? Are you seeing anyone? Yeah, a... a woman here. Is it serious? I don't know. I think it is. What are you talking about? How can you even... Adrian, it's serious, right? I don't know. What are you doing on that ship? I wasn't supposed to see you for another year. I thought you were going to stop running away. - I wasn't running away. - Yes, you were. That's your game. You always pack up and jet! Yeah, well, not anymore! Not anymore, Adrian, because there is nowhere for me to go. Why have you done this? Because you left me, OK? And I miss you. Is that why you came? I just never figured out how to love anyone else, you know? You're going to die because of me? No. No. Adrian, I do not want you to think of it like that. You hear me? I do not want you to remember me like this. Listen. I want you to listen to me, Adrian. Close your eyes. Just do it. I want you to go back. Go back. We're... we're in our first house, and you're sitting in that room with the big window. Do you see it? Yeah, I see it. You look through the window, and you see the tree on the sidewalk. And you see the painting on the wall, and it's the man on the horse. And the sunlight is on your face. I feel it. And there's someone next to you, Adrian. Yeah. Who is he? It's you. Lee? We're coming up on nightside. - Adrian, can you hear me? - Yes. Adrian, you have to say goodbye to me. You have to say goodbye to me now. We don't have any more time left. I love you. I love you too. You know what. I... I think I've been more afraid of the saying goodbye than anything else. How much time? 15 minutes. So I guess it's our turn to say goodbye. Wait. I've been thinking, maybe we missed something. We didn't. Then you know what? I'll go. You'll land the ship - Oh, sure. - You can. It's easy. The computer does most of it. The computer? John, you don't even know how to work the stupid thing. It's not that difficult. There are eight routines, uh, 14 sub... no, 16 subroutines. The main thing is the initiation sequence. It's a basic signature code. It'll get you down to the subroutines. John. Then, all you need is the navigation, the proximity sensors, and then... - John! - Listen. You have to learn this. We don't have much time! I am not gonna learn this! Do you hear yourself? I'm sorry. Then we'll both go. What? I'm going with you. Oh, really? We'll go together. John, I'm gonna die. Do you really think I want you to die too? But I want... No. I don't care what you want. I'm telling you what I want. You're going to live, because I say so. You don't get a choice. John, you have to live. We did something wrong, and you have to go down there and make it right. You have to tell them about the mines. Adrian didn't know. They haven't told the miners. You have to do something else for me. You have to tell people what happened up here. You have to tell them why nobody would help us. Maybe then it won't be for nothing. Promise me. I promise. OK. Let's get this over with, huh? It's too cold in here. There's still time left. I don't want you to go. I don't want you to go! No! John! Go away! Let me go! Think of all the people that are gonna die! I don't care! No! If you care about me, don't make this any harder. Oh god. John, I love you. I'm sitting in a field on Earth. I'm sitting under a tree, and I can feel the grass under my feet and the sun on my face. And it feels warm. And there's someone sitting next to me... John. And this was the last time you talked to your sister? Yes. The lieutenant landed an hour or so later. I was with the team that found the ship. We took him to the clinic for his injuries. That's where he was arrested. Did you talk with him when you brought him in? Yes. Yes. What was the nature of your conversation? We talked about Lee. You had no problem speaking to the man who was responsible for the death of your sister? John's not responsible for what happened, not to Lee and not what happened later. He tried to warn people, but the company wouldn't let him. That's all, Mr. Cross. I can tell you who's responsible. You are! All of you! Mr. Cross, not another word! Bring in Barton. You can step down. Lieutenant, you've watched this hearing in its entirety from your holding cell? I have. Do you have any other facts to present? Facts which might shed new light on the events we've outlined to the board here this afternoon. No. It sounds to me like you all have it just about perfect. Ladies and gentlemen, I won't bore you with the facts again. You heard what happened. I would just ask you to remember, as you consider Lieutenant Barton's sentence, that we are still dealing with the consequences of his actions on that day a year ago. We are still dealing with the families of the miners who chose to work. 12 men have died because of what the lieutenant did. Many more are seriously ill, and the general strike that this incident touched off has cost much. This incident was the genesis of all the problems we've had this year. And Lieutenant Barton is to blame. Does the accused wish to make a statement before hearing sentence? Yes, actually, I do. I promised Lee I wouldn't let anyone die because of what we did. And men have died. I promised I would tell people what happened, that I would try to change things. And things remain unchanged. You can do what you like with me. I don't think I matter. But I don't think you'll be able to kill the idea of having killed her. Objectives? I think we should make an example. Objections? John Barton, following the recommendation of the prosecution, you are to be sentenced as follows. All company stocks shall be seized by the corporation. You are to be dishonorably discharged. And you will spend 15 years in the mines, on the labor colony, VL 6. Corporal, you're to take the lieutenant back to holding. You will take the lieutenant back to his cell, or you'll be charged with contempt of these proceedings! It's all right to come on over here and take me away. Thank you, sir. If you ever need anything, sir, you just let someone know. Thank you.
