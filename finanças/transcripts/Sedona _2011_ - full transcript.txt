Hey, Mona, how you doing up there? Fabulous. Excellent. Do you wanna get a photo? I'm gonna go ahead and circle back around. Hey, Linda, what's up? I just don't know where I am. Denny! Denny, get down. Hi, young man. Hi. Where are you visiting from? San Diego. That's in California. Is that your friend? No, that's my brother, Jeremy. He's twelve. You want a balloon? Sure. There you go. Ah, I got it. Let's go. Guys! Come on. What about you? Do you want one? Yeah? Can we go on a helicopter? No. Absolutely not. Why not? Give me my phone. Oh, hey! I'm in sedona. What? Sedona? Okay. Well, at least you're in the right state. Bye, mum. Bye. Why are you running so far behind? Wait a minute. Tammy, I-- so, what are you calling about? Did you get the message he left for you this morning? Well, beckwith has to leave tomorrow morning. What? Oh, crap! He's canceling our meeting? Seriously? Denny! Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to have to call you back. I should call you back. What are you thinkin'? Huh? He's fine. Sorry about that. What happened? What is wrong with you? You know you're not supposed to just run out into the street! So what do we do first? Look for a plane? And wait for us. I did that! All right, all right, all right. All right, come on. Let's go. Hop. Come on. Hey! Of course I'm ready. Shit, does it have to happen today? This is too important for something to go wrong. I want that contract. Oh, stop it. I thought you were ignoring your birthday, anyway. Ignoring it doesn't mean it's not still cursed. You're being ridiculous. At the op-- uh, how far are we from Phoenix? That's about two hours. That's it? Probably get in not long after your spa appointment, I've got plenty of time. So don't you dare miss it. What's that supposed to mean? I could have driven, you know. Yeah. I'm just checking my messages. You're running down my batteries. Hey! I was listening. Stop! How did we ever survive before the cell phone? Hey, Andy. You talk on your phone just as much as I do. Oh, please. I-- who doesn't even have their phone here? Well, it's good to have one with you. Yeah, but you don't have to answer it every Dee-dang time it rings. Well, if I don't answer it now, then they keep calling, and then I'm gonna have to call them back-- so, it's just one of those things we have to deal with later. You know, it wouldn't hurt to just turn it off. Focus on your family for a while. It's not fair. All right? What do you think I'm doing? What's the point of a vacation? It's your birthday, for crying out loud. Okay, slow down. Slow down. Quick. Stop the car. Stop the car. Boys. Boys, look. Where? That. Right up there, on the left. What is it, daddy? Pigs? I want to see 'em. They must be are they mean? No. Yes. Yeah. Okay, so now we're going to be flying over boynton canyon, and on the right, comin' up, you can see the backside-- All right. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Okay, we're going to have to come back to the airport. I've got some sort of engine problem. Oh, come on! What? All right. I'll turn the ringer off, okay? Why don't you just leave it in the car? What? Leave your phone in the car. I dare you. What if we need it? Why would we need it? You want me to leave it in the car. Yes, I do. That's gonna make you happy. That will make me very happy. Okay. In the car. No! Yes. Here it goes! Oh. I love you! Put me down. Okay. Here we go. Do we I'm tired. Can we go back to the lodge? - No. - Where's mine? Right here. I can do it! All right. Whoa. Uh, gordy? I think you're too low. What? What the-- Oh, there you go. Boo! Yeah. All right. You got me. Hey, can we go to the alien restaurant again tonight? No! Remember what today is? We're gonna take daddy someplace special. Please? I want to play that video game. It's so cool. Maybe tomorrow. Okay. All right. Give me your hand. I can do it! Yeah, yeah, I know. Just give me your hand. Okay. Give me your hand. Hi, this is Tammy Johnson. I need to cancel an appointment at the spa. Yeah. No, it's for a massage, a couple of other things-- one o'clock. Yeah, I'm not gonna be there. Can you handle that? No, but don't cancel the reservation, just cancel the appointment. You got that. Okay. Thank you. Hey, how's it goin'? How do you think? Oh, sorry. So, how's my car? Oh, the car is fine. Except for the axle. Now, we ain't a body shop, so we can't do nothin' about the bumper and the dents and scrapes on the ass-end of it. So what about the axle? Well, we can have you on the road, uh, tomorrow morning. Oh, no. That won't do. I need it fixed now. Oh. Well, normally that wouldn't be a problem, but, uh, we got several jobs ahead of you. Here. Charge me double, I don't care. Charge me triple. Just do what you got to do. Well, all righty, then. Like I said, you're at the top of the list. How much time? Couple hours, probably. What are you waiting for? Oh. Uh, yes, ma'am. I'll get right on it for you. Alana! Did you hear? Jalandhara just told me that a tour plane landed on 89a! Isn't that incredible? Incredible. This lady can tell you all about it, firsthand. Oh, really? How so? We're fixin' her car. Oh, you mean-- I'm the lucky person said plane landed on. Oh! Oh, oh. I'm sorry. It just took me off-guard. You must have been scared to death. I'm Deb lovejoy. Tammy Johnson. Hi, Tammy. So, you were right there, at that exact moment. Why do you think that was? A really crappy coincidence. Oh, hon. There are no coincidences. Mercury is in retrograde. It started last night. Would you like me to do a reading? A reading? Mm-hmm! Oh, well, an intuitive reading. No charge, under the circumstances. You mean, that psychic bullshit? No, i-I'm sorry. I-- it's just that I don't believe in that... stuff. No offense. Oh, I don't get offended, hon. Listen. If you change your mind, there's my card. Hey, Deb. I just had an idea. Do you have an opening? She has, like, a two-hour wait. Oh, yeah. I can take you right now. Ladies, didn't you hear me? I am depressed enough without knowing my future. Oh, not that. I'm talkin' about your feet. Mm, feet. She does pedicures. Oh, that's perfect! I heard you cancel your massage appointment, and this is the next best thing. It's better! I don't think so. Oh, you have to! It's like fate, almost. Almost! It is fate. And I would not mess with fate, if I were you. You don't want to piss off the stars. N-- uh-- okay, whatever. It's better than standing around here. Your feet are in my hands. Denny! Hey, be careful. Why do you got to get so close? Wow. This is beautiful. Scott. This really is worth a look. Uh, yeah, right. But that's too cool. Hey, dad, can we go climb down it? No. And look, I don't understand! There's nothing you could see from over there that you can't see from over here. Boys, stand there for a picture. I-I don't think that's a good idea. Will you just come down here and take a picture with your sons? I'm not having any fun! Okay? Come on! Perfect. Now, you are from... Portland. Oh, I hear it's really beautiful there. Well, it rains a lot. And it's your first time in sedona. Yeah. Not that I meant it to be. Oh. Not consciously, anyway. Say, do you have a restroom I can use? Oh, sure. Right this way. Thank you. You feel anything? No. I don't feel anything-- guys, watch it so close to the edge, please? What am I supposed to be feeling? Mm. This is a vortex. What's a vortex? It's a heightened center of spiritual energy. Or something like that. I don't know. That's what the guy at the store said. Oh, "the guy at the store" said that? Oh. Oh, which guy was it? Was it the guy dressed like Jesus, was it the guy-- With a giant Santa beard? It was Jesus. It was Jesus? I knew it. If you can't trust Jesus, who can you trust? What, didn't your client tell you about the vortexes? No, he didn't mention vortexes. He just said that this, uh, place would help me get more connected. Connected to what? Your BlackBerry? My inner child. Did she say that? Did she say those exact words? Yup. Love her. Jeremy? Keeping an eye on your brother? Yes. Yes. They're fine. So let 'em be kids for a little while. Don't have to be so... Neurotic about it all the time. It's not neurotic to want to keep him safe. Remember when Jeremy was, like, two or three? We used to go to your parents' lake house. Every single weekend. You remember that? Yeah. Why don't we ever do that anymore? That was you remember fun? I remember fun. We got two kids. We got a house to pay for. We're kinda busy. You know charlene? You know her brother, who just died? Yeah. He was 40. He wasn't 40. He was 40... He wasn't 40. Yes, he was. No, he wasn't. He was older than that. Yes, he was. He was 40, and he dropped dead of a heart attack. What's your point? My point is, is that you are working yourself into an early grave. And if you drop dead of a heart attack, it's really gonna piss me off. Charlene's brother was fat. Not that fat. Yes, he wa-- what are you talking about, "not that fat"? All right, hey, listen. Look at me. I'm just sayin', chill, baby. Okay? I'm a lot more relaxed than I used to be. What? And charlene's brother was Okay? What do you think it looks like? A mountain. No! What do you think it looks like? I don't know. I think it looks like a lariat. Look! It looks like a big rock to me. I want to climb it. Yeah, right. Like you could climb it. Could if I wanted to. You can't even climb the oak tree at grandpa's. So? That's not the same. You're too little. No I'm not! Yeah, you are. Shrimp. Daddy said to quit calling me that. Ooh, sorry, mini-shrimp. Stop it! No! I'm telling daddy. Yeah, whatever. Would you like holistic, or basic? Say what? Holistic includes balancing your chakras, and a little reflexology. Uh, no thank you. Just whatever's quickest. Basic it is. Your feet are like cement. Ouch! See what I mean? What's your sign? Why? Well, I have a guess. I want to see if I'm right. I dabble a little bit in astrology. Well, my birthday's today, so you tell me. Oh, my goodness! Happy birthday. How old are you? That, I'd rather not discuss. Oh, I love birthdays. I always feel like I made it through another year, and I'm still here! They remind me of all the mistakes I've made in my life. Well, how you view it is how you do it. That's my motto. So were you right? About what? About my sign. Would you believe me if I said I was? No. How old is your son? I'm sorry? You mentioned you had a son? No. Oh, no, you didn't. My mistake. Well, she's not sick. Then what is it? You are pregnant. She can't be. That's impossible. That's impossible, right, Tammy Jo? You dozed off. That's a good thing. Shouldn't you get that? No, not in the middle of our session. Disturbs the flow. And besides, it's rude. I think you should answer the door. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. Nicholas, what the hell? I tried calling. You didn't get my e-mails? You can't just show up at my house. I've got a client in there. I got a job. Oh, Nicholas. It's with an insurance company. That's nice. In a few weeks, I'll be able to afford my own place. I thought I had made myself clear. I'm doing everything you told me to do. Oh, you poor thing. Stop that! Now, you just don't get this, do you? I cannot go out with someone younger than my kids. You said that age was just a number. You said-- look at me! Now, I don't blame you for wanting me, but believe me, there are lots of girls who would love to snag you up. I don't want other-- oh, do I have to do this? If you don't leave me alone, I'm gonna have to call the police. Now, you don't want that, do you? Hmm? But-- you want me to have the flowers? Oh, they're lovely. Nicholas! Did you cut these off my bush? Oh! Go home! That guy-- sorry about that! Online dating. It has been wild. And a lot of fun. Here you go. Keep it. But we haven't finished! My car's almost ready. I got to get on the road. Thank you for everything. Oh, let me peek. Coast is clear. Listen. You know, it's not every day that your car gets run off the road by an airplane. Yeah. I'm just sayin' that everything happens for a reason. Good-bye. Good luck! Took more days off this year than I did last year. Did you know that? I bet you didn't even know that. Mm-hmm. And I take Denny to baseball, twice a week. That's something I do for him. For him or for you? He loves it. You mean, you love it. We should have let him quit when he asked us to. Oh, you know, that's a really good idea. You know what? Any time he starts something, and then he changes his mind, he should just be able to quit. Come on, you know-- he's got to know if he starts something, he needs to finish it. Hang on. To be fair, you're the one that talked him into it in the first place. Okay, well, he likes it now. No, he doesn't. Yes, he does! And if he didn't, he'd say something. He did say something. Twice. He won't say anything now, because he's afraid he's gonna disappoint you. Again. Just like last time. We should be headed back soon. Why? We've got all afternoon. I've got a conference call after lunch. You're kidding. No, I'm not. Yeah. I know you're not. You know, it's just-- never mind. Where's my iPod? Denny? Where is Denny? Denny? I'm gonna kill him! Where is he, Jeremy? He said he was coming back here. Where? Here! You're supposed to be watching him. I did! He's probably hiding. Denny? Come on, what did I tell you about hiding? Ooh! So? Wasn't it the best? Not exactly. Oh, no. You didn't like it? She talked way too much. Oh, that's just Deb. How's my car? Uh, Jay's getting a part in conwith. How long? About an hour. I've got to get the heck out of here. Is there a rental car place around here? Yeah. Sure. Come on, I'll take you. So I'll come back here in a couple of days. I'll, uh, get my car then. I got it, I got it. So, what's in Phoenix? Business. Oh, yeah? What kind of work do you do? Mind control. Really? You mean, like hypnosis? No. Advertising. Oh, cool. Do you work for a big agency or something? I work for myself. Yeah, that's awesome! Hey, I'm gonna have my own jewelry business some day? Do you have any advice? I'm not really good at giving advice. Say, listen: Call my cell if uh, Larry... Uh, les. Has any issues, sure. And do me a favor. Don't tell him that I didn't get my car, okay? Because he might just put off fixing it till later. Oh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Excuse me? I'm in a hurry here. Hmm. So am I. Can't you tell? This is exactly why we should have the cell phone. Scott, why would we need a-- to call for help! His backpack's not here. He probably has it with him. Sir? Excuse me, sir! Did you see a little boy on the trail? Little boy? He's seven years old, dark hair. No. Was he with someone? He was with us. He might just be hiding. I haven't passed anyone for quite a while. Did you guys come up from the south trail here? Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait. Um, he might have gone back up the trail that way, to the sinkhole. Yeah, right. Let's go. Jer. Denny! You look familiar! Army hand! This is kung-fu! Sha! Sha! Wa-cha! Oo-ah... Found my gun! Cool! Aw. This is Tammy. Tammy. Al Brady here. I'm great. How's Phoenix treating you? Uh-- love it here. Ah, good deal. Hey, thank you very much for accommodating us. Mr. Beckwith wants to apologize for the, uh... Last-minute change. Well, you tell Mr. Beckwith I appreciate the opportunity. You got it. Hey, one quick question for you: Do you need any other materials besides Powerpoint-- shit. Uh, no. No. Got everything I need. It's all good. Jeremy? Daddy? Jeremy? Guys, wait up! Denny! Denny? Denny! We should head back. Do you have a phone? Yeah, it's in the car. Dad? What? He was talking about that rock. What rock? He said it looked like an alien. He wanted to climb it. Which one? Back there. Why didn't you say anything before? You guys should go to your car in case he found his way back there. I'm Chuck. This is my cell. Call me when you get there. What are you gonna do? Look for your kid. I'm a local. I know the area. Well, wait. Shouldn't we dial 9-1-1 first? Nah. I'm a search and rescue volunteer. I'm coming with you. I'll go too. No. You've done enough. Scott! Keys. You're back? I need something from my trunk. Oh. You need a hand? No, you'd rather just keep doing what you're doing. I need my keys. In the ignition. You left my keys in the ignition? Mm-hmm. Oh, you guys work so hard. I can see why you mechanics have such great reputations for being so fast and efficient. This is just a wild guess, but I'm gonna bet that you're single. You know, that is none of your business! Well, ma'am, we can't do anything to the car till Jay gets back with the parts. Well, I would prefer that you do not leave my keys in my car. That car ain't goin' nowhere, the shape it's in, unless it's on a tow truck. Hey! May I have a cup of coffee, please? Yeah, sure. It's organic. Is it caffeinated? Uh, no. It's decaf. Do you have any real coffee? Never mind. Sorry. Um, the doctor said it wouldn't be good for the baby. The caffeine. You're pregnant? Yeah! 'Bout two months. Why would you want to throw your life away like that? There's a coffee shop around the corner. Denny! Can I talk to him? Did you find him? No, he's not here. Uh, now what should we do now? Stay there in case he shows up. Uh, just stay there. All right. Bye. Jeremy, get down. Denny! This isn't funny! You come out right now, or you're gonna be in big trouble! Hey, Scott. What is it? What kind of shoes is he wearing? I don't know. Hiking shoes. Are they merrells? Yeah. Let's go. I've decided not to tell your father. It's too much. It would kill him. By the time he gets back from his Cambodia tour, this will all be over with. So there's really no point. Is this chair being used? No, go ahead. Take it. Oh, for god's sakes. What? Not you, I'm sorry. Claire. Come on! You just sing with me. Just sing with me. I do know the tune. You know that it's, "one, two, three..." Is she crazy? Well, it kinda depends on who you ask. Around here, but-- ♪ happy birthday to you ♪ We do call her, "Claire de loon." Seriously. Yeah, you kind of have to love the old nuisance. Hmmph. What about them? They crazy too? What are they doing? Now, they are checking to see if the legend is true. What legend? You see, the artist who sculpted that statue used great detail. What kind of detail? "Left nothing up to the imagination"? You're so naughty! Now, why would I do that? Because it's, uh, a good draw. Smart. Yeah, it is good for business, but... Okay, so admit it. You're just gonna have to go see for yourself. Pierce. Tammy. You see, t-- uh! Oh. Let me help you. Ah, hell, no. You won't get it. Oh! Uh... Let me help you here. What? Who is this? It's your half-night stand. You know, the one you ditched? Oh, yeah. Brett. I'm-- it's-- uh, are you okay? Did you get my note? You forgot your necklace. Oh, shit! Thought you might like it back. Uh, yeah. Please. I'll get you a fedex number. Oh. My. God. Are you freaking kidding me? Does he have water with him? Yeah. That's good. Why? Drink. Wait a minute. You know, I'm not sure. What if he ran out? He's still okay. Why'd you ask? Just trying to get all the information I can. What is it? It's his. Denny? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Have either of you seen any car keys around here? No, sorry. We just got here. Do you mind if I look? Sure. Thank you. Excuse me. Oh. Ahh! Oh, my goodness! Excuse me. Have you seen any keys? I lost them in this area. Yes, I've seen them! Oh! Yeah, no problem. I also see your aura. Let me ask you something: When was the last time you had a complete aura cleanse? Have you seen my keys? Yes, I see keys. But before you see keys, you must see yourself! Look at you! What you need is this chakra-blaster necklace. Because this vortex-charged beauty could be yours, and not only will you find the keys to your car, you'll find the keys to your Karma! Oh, for god's sake, I am in a crisis here! How about a metaphysical? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me-- Perry! Perry? Perry, after all we've been through, you've forgotten my name? It's 'Pierce', darling. Sorry, Pierce. I lost my keys. Has anybody turned them in? Is that the best excuse you could come up with? She can't resist me! I am serious! No, the unfortunate truth is, no, I haven't seen them. Has anybody seen any keys? No, but I'd be glad to help you as soon as I can get a break. Oh, never mind! Never mind. Forget it. Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me. Have you seen a little boy up there? Today? Yeah, just now. Recently. I haven't seen much of anyone up there today. Oh. What does he look like? Oh, here. Here. That's him. Aw, cute. Yours? Yeah. How old is he? He's seven. Well, somebody's out there looking for him, I hope. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no. I'm just waiting here in case he comes back. Rockin'. Well, I'll head up there and look for him. Oh. Um... Do you have a number I can call? You have a phone on you? I do. You should always have a phone out here with you. Yeah, apparently. Okay, um-- okay, that's my number. Just call me if you see anything, okay? Will do. What's his name? His name's Denny. Okay. You're welcome. Thank you. No, really, thank you. One time, guy was out by himself, fell off a cliff, broke both his legs. He couldn't move, so he was stranded there for like 24 hours-- all right, you know what? I really don't need to hear about this right now. Okay? Sorry. What do you do? Lawyer. Corporate. Cool, man. You must make a lot of money. Not enough. You like it? Used to. Not anymore? Not so much. Why do you do it? How can you not have an extra set of keys? We don't keep extra keys at this facility. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my whole life! All keys are kept with the car, ma'am. It's standard policy. Little scratch, no problem. Big scratch? We charge you. What am I supposed to do now? Have you tried looking for the keys? Bon voyage. Okay, okay. You know what? Get me another damn car. I'd love to, miss Johnson, if I had one. What? What? No, you're not seriously telling me this is the last car you've got. That's what I'm telling you. Seriously. No. No. No! Look. This is a small town. It's not like we keep an endless supply of cars. Okay? This week has been extraordinarily busy! That's our last one. Wait! Wait! I want that car! Now, miss Johnson. Give me that car! I don't think so. You call him, right now! Now, you calm down! You give me that number. No, where are you-- no. Hey! Hey, I don't think so! Gimme that number! Ma'am-- I want you to call that man right now! That is not gonna happen. I got a couple of cars coming in this afternoon. I promise, the first one back is yours. What are you, an idiot? Have you not been listening? I need to leave town listen, ma'am, I might be an idiot, but I'm not the one who lost your keys. Alana, get me the hell out of here. Right now. Uh, wait-wait a minute, wait a minute. We're really high up. You're not good with heights? No. Look, is there any other way... That we can get... Around-- can we go around, like, another-- Of course not. No. No, he says. Just... Oh, god! No, no. I'm okay. You know, I'm not really feeling that good about this. I think we should call for help now. Why don't we circle up around that way first? Shit! Ah, shit! Ahh! Sh-it! You want a band-aid? You have one? Here. Oh, god. What's this for? Snake bites. You see the band-aids in there? There are snakes out here, huh? Why didn't you mention that before? This is Arizona. I want you to call someone. Don't worry, you don't see snakebites-- he's out there by himself! You understand? The chances of-- I'm not taking anymore chances! Okay, you make the call, you give me the damn phone! Okay. Okay. Denny! You've done this before? I've seen Todd do it. You two are getting married, right? Some day. You know, I'm kind of waiting for my family to come around. They disapprove? I'm a "p.K.", so... You know, cart before the horse? P.k.? "Preacher's kid"? Colonel's kid. Hmm. You know, a rock to the window might be faster. Funny. Do I look like I'm trying to be funny? Well, you know they have charter flights to Phoenix from here? Oh, now you're trying to be funny. Sorry. I told you there's a reason I don't fly. Get a limo. You know what? I'm not leaving here without my car, because that means I'd have to come back for it. And once I'm out of this town, I'm damn sure not coming back. You might want to move away from the car, honey. Why? Oh, my god! I can't believe you just did that! I almost had it. What's the hold-up? It's goin' good! Be done in less than an hour. Less than? Can you be more specific? 47 and a half minutes. At the most. Keep an eye on him. At this rate, I won't have any time to check in and change clothes. I'll be back in 45. Let me know if it's earlier. I gotta-- Well, you're certainly not going to find your keys under there. Not that it's any of my business, but uh, you okay? No. And you know, you are right. It's none of your business. Well, looks like you're kind of having a tough day, but... Heck, it could be worse. You hear about the tour plane that crash-landed on the street today? Now, that was exciting. What is it with you people in this town? Oh, it's the vortexes. The vortexes. Yes, the vortexes. I don't know, but it sure keeps me entertained. Mrs. Keller! Hi, sweetheart. Your cake is almost finished. It's darling. Want to see? How do I know if my water just broke? What happened? It's not time yet. I have-- more time. Come with me. I heard that. Oh, my god. I heard you singing. Excuse me? I was-- I wasn't singing. You're a liar. Claire, is there something I can help you with? No. She's just like the rest of them. No, Claire. She's not, Claire. Yes, she is. You're a-- a liar, mommy. Hey! You found my keys. Give them to me. No. Claire. No. Give them to me. No. Claire-- stop playing, she wants her keys, okay? You threw them away. What are you talking about? Who did I throw away? You threw away the keys to your heart. You just threw 'em away. Finders keepers. I just made a little joke. No! No! Let me have it! This woman is trying to Rob me! Claire! Claire. No! She'll eventually stop. Please give me-- no. No! I'm not gonna let you! Cla-- Claire! Claire. Claire, now Claire. Just give the keys, Claire. Come on. Give me the keys. Claire! Come on, now. Come on. Just give us the keys, Claire. Please. No-no-- Claire, ah! Claire. Tell me you're sorry. Tell me you're sorry. What are you-- what are you... Uh... I've been through enough. Please give me the keys. Tell me you're sorry. I am sorry. Now, say "I love you." God. Please. Please. I love you. Thank you. Here. They look nice.

As long as you want. Would you be mad? No. What would you want me to do? I want you to do whatever you want to do. Can I think about it? Yeah. I want to thank you for helping me with my rental car. Oh, sure. No problem. You know, it was an awful, despicable, evil thing that I said to you earlier about your pregnancy. It was inexcusable, and I'm sorry. Hey. It's okay. Y'all don't worry about it. Will you give me your address? What for? Because I want to send you a gift. You know, for the baby. Well, you don't have to do that! I know I don't have to. But here. E-mail me your address, okay? Oh, that's so sweet. Bye. Tammy, wait. I'd really like you to have this. What are you doing? No, I can't. No, I've got others. I designed it, so... It's no biggy. You designed this? Yeah. It's a lotus. So. Lotuses-- well, they signify new beginnings. Thank you. You're very talented. Thanks. We'll talk about this, okay? Okay. What? Oh! Bye. I'll see you. Oh! Hiya. Hey. Denny, don't ever do that again, okay? Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. No. No. It wasn't your fault. Hey. Come back in 15 years... And you got a job. Okay. Thanks again. You're welcome. Take care. Aw, god!

Great. Well-- what the hell is this? I don't know. Found it wrapped around the propeller shaft. A balloon? Hi. Hi. Welcome to the red planet. How are you? Starving. You came to the right place! Just one? No, I'm not staying. I need something to go. You have something fast, like a sandwich or something? B.L.T.? Sure, sure. B.L.T. Coming your way. Fries okay with that? Yeah, and the largest cup of coffee you got. One cup of coffee. We'll have it right out. You can wait here at the bar, if you want. Do you have a restroom? Through the main dining room, in the back corner. Hey! Unbelievable. Are you stalking me? Pierce. Hi! You remembered. What are you doing here? Oh, just eating dinner. Alone. Well, preferably not. Have a seat? I-I can't. I gotta go! I'm late. Are you sure? No. I'll save you a seat. Sorry. Thank you. Wow! What, no clever wisecrack? You deserve better. What do I owe you? No! No, no. I got this. It's okay. I know you're in a rush. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Linda. Well, I know you missed your spa appointment. I'll reschedule tomorrow. Look, I'm going to have to meet you at the beckwith building. I'm dressed and ready. Where the hell are you? Still on the road. Don't worry. "Just running a little late"? How can you be acting so calm right now? Just try to lighten up, okay? Are you all right? Tammy, what's going on? I'll call you later. Shit! Is everyone okay? Daddy, what happened? Another car bumped into us. Cool, can I see? No, honey, just stay put. Sorry. I am so-- I'm so, so sorry. You know what? It's-- actually, it's not that bad. It's uh-- Is everybody okay in there? Yeah, we're all fine. Are you okay? Yeah. Wait a minute. Aren't you the one from earlier? Sorry. Sorry. Oh, my god! Oh, believe it or not, I am a very good driver. It's just that I've had a day from hell. Yeah, well, it happens. You know, don't worry about it. Obviously, you can see how much of a hurry I'm in. So can we-- yes. I forgot a pen. I have a pen. I have a pen. Thank you. I really am sorry. Happy birthday. Oh, don't mention it. Please tell me you didn't look at the year. No, it's just that, uh, today's my birthday too. So-- really? Yes! It's funny, I mean, you know, what are the chances of that? Where are you from? What? Oh, forget I asked you that. Never mind. I-I grew up in Sacramento. Oh. Why do you ask? Oh, no reason. I was just wondering about your... Accent, or-- kinda curious. Huh. Actually, I was born in Texas. I mean, do I sound like it? No, you don't. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah! Just had a really bad day. Dad, are you coming? Yeah, I'll be right there, bud. Guys, look! Come on, come on, answer, damn you! Any word? Yeah. She should be here any minute. Great. Mr. Beckwith, this is Linda Miller. Hi! So nice to meet you, sir. Linda, my pleasure. I can't wait to meet Tammy! Well, Tammy should be here shortly. Real soon. This is really nice of you, but like Scott said, it's not necessary. I know, but it's the least I can do. Thank you for letting me. Ah, it's my mom. Just-- excuse me. Hey. I want to talk to her. Just a second. It's probably just a birthday call. Ah, yes. What's she like-- his mother? She's a sweetheart. Yeah, Scott's parents are great. Well, I love you too. Let me talk! Yeah. Hi, 'nam-maw. You ready? Yeah. I know, right? Uh-huh. Sorta.
