The Albatross FOR A CLEAN FRANCE VOTE CAVALlER Trying to steal our materials too? Bastard! But we're maintaining order. Under whose jurisdiction? Grim's men were defacing our posters. You can handle a truncheon, can't you? He went that way. He must have gone over the wall. - He's one of Cavalier's guys! - No, one of Grim's. - He went over the wall. - l know, l saw him. They're preventing industrialisation to protect private interests, Private? But we're talking about the small businessman! lndustrialisation can't be achieved without upheavals, The language of a technocrat, A technocrat with no heart, no soul! l'm working for the future, for the youth of this area, You're forgetting that 2 million people over 65 are living on less than 300F a month, For 20 years now you've held this seat,,, and that's the first time you've spoken of the poor, That's called demagogy, So, Cavalier,,, artists and pensioners don't move you? And the disabled? l'd work for them, And the war veterans, l say no to risks! No to improvisation! Stripping away conservatism isn't a risk! lt's the way to the future! You live in the past, Chancellor, Your view has appeal, but voters dislike tightrope walkers, We'll see in 8 days, Here ends the debate between Chairman Cavalier and Chancellor Lucien Grim, principal candidates in next Sunday's vote, Get me 8095 at Badenheim, please. Extension 127. ls that you? l made it out. The main problem is transport. ln 3 or 4 hours at most, if everything goes well. You'll wait at the border as planned? Where? Fine. Miss Cavalier. - What happened? - Grim's men, again. Tell your father it can't continue. Look, he stole my shoes. - And my coat. - He came in here. He's here now. Come on, let's find him. - What's going on? - The grandeur of political duty. Your father was wonderful! He trampled old Grim. l'm sure he'll be elected. Are you going to Odile's party? Of course. At the convent school we 5 were inseparable. Odile's the last to get married. Except you. Except me. Don't move. Take the coat. You'll accompany me out. No way. Then l'll shoot. She's showing off with her young lover. Doesn't stop her father from sitting in judgement on us. l'm not worried, we'll see on election day. But the polls say he's in the lead. l don't care about polls, l trust the voters. After attacking a nurse, Stef Tassel escaped from Markstein prison, The police are currently in pursuit, lsn't that the guy who was with Paula Cavalier? That's right! What did you say? Are you sure? lt was him, and he was with her, Chancellor. You'll see. Miss Cavalier's private life doesn't concern us, Pierson. Especially without proof. Proof? Your proof can't be too far away. Pick that up. Not the keys. Where's your car? Find it yourself. Where? At the back, on the right. They must have left together. You know me, Chancellor. l wouldn't play games... l'm sure it was Tassel. - Why not... - We must tell the police. Found them? - You know who we're after? - Tell me. A campaign aide who tried to misappropiate a van. To steal Cavalier's electioneering van! You see? How original. You couldn't identify the troublemakers? lt was one of your men. l doubt it. Open it. You drive. Get going. FOR A PROSPEROUS FRANCE LUClEN GRlM Tassel escaped by the river. So he may well have come to land near here. Pierson, l've often had occasion to appreciate your discretion. None of this is my business. But my agricultural grant, l've been waiting... You haven't got it yet? - l'll see you have it Monday. - lf you put it that way... You're leaving? Take your wife, and don't mention all this. Politics are a man's business. You were tough on me. And you've got a thick skin. You can verify it next Sunday. Or who knows, maybe earlier. See you soon, Chairman. l'd have liked to see your lovely daughter, but... Please, give her the respects of an old admirer... When you see her. Nazeran, where's Paula? At the Chief Justice's party for his daughter's wedding. l see. To the campaign office! Earlier, would you have fired? Earlier, yes. And now as well. ls Grim paying you? Which one's Grim, fat or thin? He'd do anything to sink my father and keep his seat. Cavalier, Paula. Twenty-four years old, single. Let's go. l'm sorry, but you must tone down your plan of action. But l need double that manpower to seal the north area. l need people for demonstrations, fights... We're in election period. Tassel's a cop-killer, we must catch him. Yes, but l can't mobilise everybody for one man who's probably already in hiding. You've kidnapped me, kissed me... do you count on raping me, too? lt's a possibility. What about reform? You see no difference between my father and Grim? No, they're both scum. Chancellor... Cavalier's men attacked my sympathizers again. lt seems your sympathizers were defacing his posters. Let them prove it. ln fact Superintendent, you should keep an eye on the company my adversary keeps. And his family. What l've learned is of such gravity that l thought l should tell you myself. l'm listening. You're looking for an escaped prisoner. Tassel? That's right. He was at l'H''tel de Ville this evening. What? That's not all. Tassel was dancing... with Paula Cavalier. What you're suggesting is... l know, it's outrageous. But l advise you to make the necessary verification. l haven't seen Paula Cavalier since. l think now l'll be re-elected. Think about it. Good hunting. Does he want me compromised? Obscene photos maybe? You must know how to kiss... not badly, when you want to. Know how to make love... a bit, when you want to. But l hate constraint. No trace of Stef Tassel, 'the Albatross', who's escaped from prison, Arrested in '68 for killing a policeman, Stef Tassel used,,, Of course. We're checking on Paula Cavalier as we speak. Yes, we'll keep you informed. My respects, Minister. Juget... Put everything on Tassel, we need him now! - Double your manpower. - Very good, sir. Left. What the hell... You said left. Left on the highway, don't play games! Stop, switch off your lights. Taking a politician's daughter... that must cost! At least 20 years. Romeo 2, this is Romeo 3. Roadblock 2 is in place. - This'll take all night. - My wife will flip. - Why, is this her night? - Asshole. lf you're not working for Grim, why take me? Me, of all people? Where are you taking me? Time will tell. Think you can fly over the roadblocks? - Like an albatross? - Go right. Go right, go left, is that your future? Think you'll last long that way? Ten years... or ten minutes. lt depends. lf you take me to my father he'll show his appreciation. - With money? - Not only that. - He's a good christian? - Yes, exactly. Stop and l won't kill you, but them. l'll warn you, l won't help you. One mistake and l'll get you. l need my freedom too. Stop. Back up to the fork. When will they catch you? ln ten years? ln ten minutes? Time will tell. l don't carry spare petrol. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Slow down. Back up. The little politician has character! Go on, to the pump. Do you have any 5F coins? l'm flat broke. lt's broken, l've been trying for ages. l'll go the the next gas station. Bad luck. Open the trunk. l hope you'll manage to fix the pump. l'll manage. Thanks. What's that? Newlyweds. ln a hurry. Maybe they're over there in the trees. l'll check anyway. OK, l'll go to the A32. Call you in 5 minutes. Have you seen a girl in a long dress and a white coat? ln a long dress? Here? Are you joking, or what? Don't yell. - l'm first. - As always... Stop it. Get up. Want the girl? Want her? And her, do you want her too? Do you? Thanks, l can serve myself. Empty your pockets. Shall l leave you with them? lt's all your fault. You'll pay for it! Take her clothes. What about me? l'll be naked. Must be used to it. And you keep calm, otherwise... Martial here. Anything suspicious? No, you were right. Newlyweds. l'll switch their lights off and join you. lf it reassures you, it's not mine. - You'd have liked them to rape me! - lsn't it every woman's fantasy? - What would you know, you... - Pathetic loser. This your car? Officer, l... What happened? Nothing, we just got married, and you see... We're fighting already. Where were you? You have to ask? l have to do my rounds. Show me your papers. Here. Hands on your head. You didn't recognise Stef Kassel? The cop-killer. Didn't you hear her? Be afraid! Move and she gets it. Do as he says. l'm Mr Cavalier's daughter. He kidnapped me. - Were you looking for me? - No, your daughter. - At this hour? - l'm very sorry. Paula's at a party for the Chief Justice's daughter. Why do you want her? lt's not serious. l believe she has a Rover, license plate 288WJ68... - Has it been stolen? - lt's possible. An inmate escaped from Markstein prison. He's been seen in a car bearing that number. lt's possible, she never locks her car. Goodnight. Mr Chairman... Germain... lf she calls, say l've gone to meet her. Very good, sir. An escaped con in Paula's car... - The press will have a field day. - And 8 days to the election! My adversaries are unrelenting, they may have set this up. - With the police? - They're always tied up in politics. - And in politics... - Anything goes. That's right, Mazeran. Even blows below the belt. l found his helmet. Without their uniforms and guns, they look like everyone else. - Why do you do this job? - lt's just a job. Carpentry's a job too, and a beautiful one, don't you think? You mentioned a roadblock at the Mittelberg intersection... Yes, roadblock 4. So what do we do? There's the forestry road. lt's an abandoned track that bypasses the intersection. Follow your guide. lt isn't blocked? lf we blocked every trail... l'll make you a deal. Help me, and when we arrive l'll release you. Both of you, alive and safe. And you'll accept it? l don't want to be decorated posthumously. Lights off. Roadblock 4, down there. Good work. Give him his medal. We don't like medals. You can put your lights back on. ''For a clean France... ''vote Cavalier.'' You could have warned me earlier. You told me your daughter was at the Chief Justice's party. l went, and she wasn't there. Nor was her car. She's free, and maybe her car was stolen. l'm afraid not. You'll see. You mean she was kidnapped? That may not be the right word. And what is the right word? Repeat what you said earlier. The guy and the girl were together. A thief and a slut! Stuck-up bitch! Did you speak to them? Where? Down there, in the bush. What were you doing there? Same thing as them. Please... Was she being threatened? A prisoner? Prisoner? Yeah, right! They were a real pair! They stole her clothes. Because her pretty dress was torn. And who tore it? Not us, anyway. Alright, l admit Paula was kidnapped by this... Tassel, Stef. 35... 20 years in solitary for killing a policeman. But that she's his accomplice, 8 days from her father's election? lt's impossible! Tassel is a rather special criminal. - Killing a policeman is unusual? - No, it isn't. lt's normal, daily even. But Tassel pleaded self-defence. That doesn't explain my daughter's involvement. For certain idealists, Tassel is an exemplary victim. A romantic hero. And Miss Cavalier is so young. You speak often of youth... Are you going to go public with those hooligans' statements? Not before Tassel and your daughter are arrested. l know what it would cost me to speak without proof. Pray that l'm not elected. Turn right, we'll go to lllstadt. But the ceremony's not until tomorrow. l'll have time to see Hebrardt. - The lnspector General? - Yes. The Liberal Democrats gave millions to my campaign. lf Grim attacks, they'll hit back. Above or below the belt? And now? No more blocks till Koenigsfurt, in principal. And if there's one anyway? No problem, l've 2 hostages. You'll get through one, then we'll be identified. - What then? - l'll still have 2 hostages. Who you'll sacrifice if you need to. l'd forgotten, you're capable of murder. Or wasn't it murder? How did it happen? During a burglary? ln a hold-up? ln a police station. And what happened? You couldn't understand. Of course, to you l'm just an idiot. But look what l can do! Go for help, quick! Listen, the cop l killed... Stop, don't shoot! Shouldn't have shot. Shouldn't have... ls anyone there? ls anyone here? Papers, please. Germain... Paula? When? Where? So is he still at large? We'll get him eventually. What's going on? Paula called, she's free. She's waiting for me in Burgshoffen. - And the police? - Every man for himself. l want to get my daughter, first. Blowing a tire at night, that's unlucky. We could give him a hand. lt'll slow us down. We should stop. lt'll slow us down. Thank you, they're waiting for me... Close the door. So, they're waiting for you? Where? Who? The police? - l didn't tell anyone. - Liar. And the cop, what did you do with him? He shot first. You killed him? You're lying. The dead man lives. So you see, l didn't lie. And you? Everything's falling back in place. We'll win. And l'll be in power. Have you ever had an orgasm with a woman or a man? lt lasts seconds. Power is like an orgasm that lasts 24 hours a day. By God, that's him! Read it and sign. What's wrong? lt's exactly what you told us earlier... Sir, he's been spotted. By the Eisenbart military camp, near Kronn. l'm on my way. Once re-elected, l won't forget you did your duty. As always. The border - is 15km from there. - ls that where they're waiting? What would l do at Burgshoffen? Though they do say it's pretty. We're nearly there. Paula's got some explaining to do. She almost jeopardised my campaign. Here we are, Burgshoffen. Your hand's still bleeding. - Are you a nurse? - l know first-aid. Do you play tennis, as well? - And play the piano. - The tuba. Now! Help! No, there won't be a second vote... But even with a guaranteed 6?/? of the vote... l should kill you for that. Your trip ends here. We're at Burgshoffen, seems calm. Patrolling the streets. Over. NlGHT BELL What happened? - He has a bullet in his shoulder. - You need a doctor, not me. Look after him. Little punk. - Where's the phone? - There. Room 22... The bullet must come out. There's no answer? Yes, l know the time. lt's urgent, try again. Keep trying. - She should be here. - Did you see that police van? Try again. l know he'll answer. Go and get her from the office. l'll wait. - You'll need a tetanus shot. - Don't bother. She's not at the election office. - But someone heard a scream. - A scream? Chairman... take this. l'll go that way. SOPORlFlC Don't move. ''Vote Cavalier for a clean France...'' - lt's you she's meeting? - Listen, you can't keep her. They say she's your accomplice. lt's terrible, all they want is a scandal. lt'll demolish me! Do you want money? lt's yours. How much? l can help you, l've got pull. l'll get you a new trial... Bastard! What's going on? The horn! Not so great, your dad. Look out! General call, Tassel's been spotted on highway 344. Horn's stuck. Driving without lights. Received. Going towards Burgshoffen. Over to you. Hear that? lt's coming from the lake. lt's him. You can leave. What's up, Phillibert? What is it? Move along, everybody. No, sir, you can't go in there. Go away. - Once they've operated, hide him. - Alright. Chairman Cavalier is waiting for you at his office. No photos. l'm here on a personal basis. Move on. Did the cop confirm the daughter's involvement? On the contrary. He claims she resisted the whole time. But we have other statements. And Cavalier's behaviour. l'll talk to him. Tell him the press are hounding me for a statement, and l'd like to discuss it with him. But Secretary-General, it's urgent... Superintendent Gaber... lt's at 10 o'clock at the war memorial. lt's very serious. The policeman's talking, he says you were meeting your daughter. That's a lie. l was coming to my office here, that's all. - We could have got Tassel. - And my daughter with him. All so your friend Grim could inform the press, and ruin me. The Chancellor Grim wanted me to tell you that he's at your disposal to help decide how to keep this affair quiet. He's hounded by the press. Right! He's using his friendships to sink my campaign. Get Tassel, first. We're on it. A patrol spotted him near the Schwartzwasser lakes. And what'll keep him there? The need for sleep. The pharmacist managed to inject him with a dose of soporific. - Liar. l'll remind you that l'm on oath. As such, l'll have to testify to the events of this night. Please keep me informed of your movements. Chancellor Grim is here. We need time! Bring him in. Chancellor, would you like a coffee? He'd make a great diplomat. So, are you happy? You set this all up, ''for a prosperous France''. Or a prosperous Grim. You're being unfair. l've been working for hours to keep this story under wraps. l suppose you've an offer for me? ln my own interests, of course. l've got pull on the inside. l can stop all this. The witnesses, your presence here, and your daughter's imminent arrest can all stay quiet. lf...? You withdraw, renounce your candidacy. ls that all? Let's understand each other. You'll get a piece of the cake. There are always very large crumbs. And in a few years you'll run again. - At that time l'll... - You'll have made your nest egg. l want my advantages while l'm young. l'd have preferred that too, but that's life. l'll consider it. Be quick, the papers come out at 5am tomorrow. - You'll have my answer tonight. - Good. And thank you for the coffee. lt wasn't poisoned, l hope. l've no statement... for the moment. Think the party can stop Grim? They'll demolish that toad. And if they don't, l will. l'll slowly destroy him. For a clean France. Why here? There's no road. There are trails, and the quarry. He could have hidden his car in it. Private interests are preventing industrialisation, Private? l'm talking about the small businessman! Nothing is achieved without upheavals, The language of a technocrat, - Give me a raspberry liqueur? - None left. What about the youth? You're forgetting 2 million people over 65 have less than 300F a month, Yes, you forget, You've had the post for 20 years! - l'd have preferred raspberry. - None left, l said. We searched the surrounding area. No trace of a car, nothing. We were leaving when Roblin saw that... The fog, the soporific... the police chase... it was fatal. We need to get them out. A dossier... Of course we have a dossier on Grim. We've one on everybody. We must use it, Secretary-General. lt's vital. To our dear departed... Dossiers can't be used lightly. Who's to say he doesn't have one on me, too? We've done business. lf l lose you'll have wasted your money. lt'll be your fault for flaunting your connections with a gangster. All those our country... Shut Grim up, please! l've fought 20 years for this. So you need us to bury this, too. Like the Ben Karba affair, or that Carmovitz business... lf Grim can manipulate the police why can't you? lf the party agrees, l'll use one little dossier. lt'll make a good muzzle. But l need authorization from Paris... - and l'll get my hands dirty. - l'll owe you one. ''Happy those who die in a just war...'' ''Happy the ripened corn and the harvest.'' They've found Tassel's car. At the bottom of a lake. ls the girl in it? We don't know, they've sent in divers. Hell! lf Paula Cavalier is dead, her father becomes a martyr. Untouchable by respect for his sorrow. He'll get 60?/? of the vote and l'll be washed up. Why? There may be nothing in the car. Let us pray, Pierson. And? Can't see a thing, it's full of mud. We need to bring it out. l said you could leave. lf l had they'd have caught you. That's my problem. You hate me, don't you? No, l don't like you. You've been shopping, l see. l'm a good little home-maker. Want me to get your slippers? Switch on the TV? ls there anything to drink? Serve yourself. There's a watchman. You're worth more than your father. My father's a coward, it's true. But yours... he's a hero, maybe? You'd better wait for night. l know where there's raspberry. Do you? Where you see it? Where? There. ln the supermarket. You can't leave now. - lt's too early. - lt's still too late. - l'll go with you. - No point, you've no car now. What'll you do? There are cops everywhere. Lower your head and shoot at random? That's my business. You're used to shooting cops. Will you stop with that? You don't even know what happened. That's true. When you're stopped in the street after a demonstration and beaten up in the police station, what do you do? You hit back. One cop's left and you're charged with murder. But what about the other, at Burgshoffen? - Didn't you... - l took him for help. ln return l got a shot of soporific. That's what you get for kindness. lt's Sunday, right? You're alone. You can get whatever you like. So, shall we go? lt's empty. Cordon off the sector. He'll be so doped up he can't have got far. Have you ever shaved a man before? A few. Your lovers? Leave my lovers out of this. ln the graveyard of memories. The black tombs of late lovers. Did you go through many? Go through what? Men. Lovers. Don't play the virgin. Why are you so nasty to me? l'd like you to be more natural. - Less tense. - Got a recipe? l always say what l'm thinking. And l don't? No, you put your pride first. Proud? Me? We'll see. Let's see. Last night... When those two guys wanted to... rape me, l... l felt... l had an orgasm. They've got some. l'll show you where. Think you'll manage to get away? l've my whole life to do it. Your whole life? 10 years, 10 minutes... it depends. But if it was 10 minutes... l'd rather be myself for 10 minutes than someone else for a lifetime. You'd make a beautiful widow, if you had a husband. And if you won't steal it, l will. Earlier, you said you didn't like me. Yes, because l say everything. And not just one bottle, l assure you. l forbid you. lf anyone steals from here it'll be me. And desire? When you've spent 2 years alone in a cell it doesn't take much. Would you make love to me? ls it because l might die tonight that l interest you? You can't get out alone. Get out of here! l'll scream... Take the wheel. Drive. Go to the border, or as far as you can. And avoid the bumps. You're nuts, you won't do 3km! Please, are you going to the town? To the border? Could you take the children? To the town? They want to go to the fair. lt's not far. No, l can't. They like the carousel. They need some fun. lt's normal at their age. Do you speak French? Your vehicle papers. What did l do with them? l must have left them at home. l was at the graveyard, l was taking flowers to my husband's grave. And the kids are hungry. What'll l do? lt's dreadful. Since his death l forget everything. Do you understand? l just live in town. l'll go get them and be right back. Alright, l'll take down your license plate. You can go. A Volkswagen, license number 1733 EG 68. Seen it? l don't think so, but perhaps my colleagues have. Lieutenant. Thank you, ma'am. You're very clever, ma'am. Take me to the border, ma'am. lt's right near here, ma'am. That's not it. Drive on. End of the line. Not for me, l still have customs. Are you going to fly over it? Like an albatross? Someone will take me. But not by threats, this time. A friend, a real one. Only the papers will be false. Alright, l'm here. You scared me. l called you last night. Where's your car? A brown Opel? l'm on my way. ls he here? Until next time, Mr Tassel. Adieu, Miss Cavalier. BORDER 500m. - So, you got away. - lt wasn't easy. l've everything you need. There. Quickly! You work for the Ministry of the lnterior. Not bad, hey? l'm very honoured. Superintendent Gaber, step out. Miss Cavalier, where is Tassel? - ln Germany. - What? While l was occupying you here he passed calmly through. You're under arrest. Contact Chairman Cavalier and Chancellor Grim. Tell them she's being provisionally held at Pilsheim. - We're going back. - But... we're through, we're in Germany. We're going back. So, my daughter's been put in prison? ln the director's office, in secret. After her games at the border... She made a mistake, it's true. But who hasn't? Don't worry, nothing's been leaked. My proposition still holds. lt holds by a thread. You've had the whole day to think, my dear friend. But you've only minutes to think over mine, my old Grim. You were free, you got through. Thanks to Paula Cavalier. Without her l'd have been taken. Her father will make sure she gets out. But it's up to me to get her out, me alone. You love her. You don't get it. l met her by accident, she's not my type. But l won't owe anything to anyone, that's all. Pride! lf l owe you, tell me. ldiot! You were wonderful, Mr Baudouin. But now you have to go. l've no time to lose. lf l'm taken l'll say l stole your car. l need your professional lD, as well. Perhaps l'll be able to give it back. l'm Miss Cavalier's lawyer. l also have this... H'brardt will pay for this. You'll pay first if it comes to print. Little bastard! Hurts, doesn't it? Mr Baudouin... Already! Already, yes. Mr Cavalier is in a hurry. l know, but there's nothing l can do. l'm awaiting my orders, my hands are tied. Hands up! The original is at the newspaper. The presses are ready to roll, first edition comes out at 5am. You see, you've not much time. Superintendent. Free Miss Cavalier under my guarantee. l'll call your minister tomorrow. Scandal is detrimental to smooth Government. l'll be waiting for Paula in my car. You learn fast, Cavalier. You'll climb high. But when you fall it'll make noise. ln the meantime, l'm going up. He came back. Give yourself up! Tassel, you're surrounded! You're surrounded! Let your companion come down. We've not much time left. lt wasn't me on your mind. So who was it? What? Something that doesn't exist. But l exist. What did you want? One last challenge? Or to do me a favour? Go and give yourself up. They're stronger. They'll always be stronger. l'd have given you nothing but trouble. Goodbye, Miss Cavalier. No need to hide. Here. But... Why did you shoot? lt irritates people to watch others making love. Don't you find? My dear Cavalier, believe me l'm... l'll insist on an investigation to establish who's responsible. But wait... What are you going to do? Hello, Mazeran? Paula's dead. Are the presses ready to go? Then go ahead. You're sunk, Cavalier. What good will this do you? To sink you as well. For a clean France. Subtitling: Eclair Video Subtitles by Esther Russell
