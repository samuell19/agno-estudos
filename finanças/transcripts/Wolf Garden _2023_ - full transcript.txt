William. Bad dream? Maybe. You're all sweaty. It's humid here. That cock is crowing again. I was trying not to notice. It's annoying. You want me to shoot it for you? Yeah. Just have to find it first and get a gun. I think I know where it is. Gun in the drawer downstairs. What? No, there isn't. Yeah. In the living room. -Are you serious? -Mm-hmm. -That can't be legal. -It's John's uncle. You're happy? Very. And you? Despite being dragged here. You were not dragged here. So, you're feeling recharged? I think so. Okay, let's maybe give it a couple more days before making any bold statements. I'm very happy when I'm here with you. Oh, yeah? When are you here without me? I'm not. Not bringing any other women here behind my back, are you? It's an interesting idea. -Oy! -Easy, tiger. I think we should go out for breakfast. Where? Can we go somewhere with a little bit more life? There isn't anywhere. Not in walking distance. Their coffee's crap. Then have tea. I'm not dignifying that with a response. Okay. How about we have coffee in bed and then we have food after? Okay. Hold-- hold up. What's wrong? Got something in my shoe. You want to go back? -No. -If you want to go back, just say so, don't make excuses. -See? -Okay, then. Do you hear that? What? Silence. Mm-hmm. Sometimes I wish we could just escape it all. Well, we have. No, I mean, like, permanently, you know? Just leave everything behind and start fresh in a place like this. It's a nice idea, but it's too quiet here. -It would get boring. -Quiet is good. Boring is good. Escaping the rat race, even better. You'd miss the noise. You'd want to go home in a month. What if we just did it? What if we just relocate? -People would miss us. -Yeah, but would we miss them? Maybe. Maybe not. Do you hear that? What now? I thought I heard something. -Was it the silence again? -Very funny. No, it was like something was moving. -It was probably a squirrel. -It was bigger than that. You do get rabid badgers in these parts. All right, shut up. What if it's an escaped convict or an ax murderer, huh? Then I guess I'd have to kick his ass. Come on, let's get going before it rains. You know it's far too warm a night to have a fire going. -It's romantic. -It is. I think we should come back here every year. There's more places for us to see than just here, you know? Yeah, but this is our place. It's special. It doesn't have a hot tub. Okay, what is your obsession with hot tubs? You know there's a perfectly good bath, right? That's not the same. What's wrong? You will always look after me, won't you, William? I think we better not have any more wine. No, I'm not kidding. You will, right? -You know that. -Well, then say it. I'm being serious. Okay. I'll always take care of you. Where is this coming from anyway? I don't know just... I want to feel safe. You are safe. Nothing bad is gonna happen. I just get this feeling like... It's like we've been here before, but it's different. Maybe it's what's ahead. Okay. I feel like I know what's coming. And it doesn't feel good. But this is good. Right here, right now. This is all we need. Just you and me together, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Chantelle! Hurry up. It's starting to rain. -Shit. -What's wrong? -I scraped my wrist. -Here, let me see. Yeah, I think you'll live. You reckon? I mean, if we get you back to the cottage in time, we might even save the hand. Well, that's a relief. Better be careful injuring yourself like that. Don't want people to think you're self-harming. So I don't know when exactly, but she is definitely going to come. I think probably sometime at the end of October. Well? Remember what you said last time? When? Last time we were here. You said you had a feeling like we'd been here before. Maybe. I'm feeling like that right now. And you call me strange? Does this feel real to you? Does this feel like we're actually here right now? Yes. Anyway, can we get back to reality for a minute so you can actually answer my question? Look, I know we've been putting this off for ages, but she really wants to meet you and I think it's time. Whatever makes you happy. Love the enthusiasm, really. You know I love you, right? God, you really are weird sometimes. Maybe. It's true. I love you too. Chantelle! - Hello? - You didn't answer. It stopped before I got here. Called yesterday as well. It was the same thing. You haven't gone out, have you? Have you? - I was... - Just answer. - Only for a bit. - Jesus Christ. - I had to. - I told you, all right, you can't do that, it's not safe. I only went for a walk down the road. You didn't want to see her? No. It's too risky, all right? You need to be smart. And, hey, you don't understand what's going on out there. I think I do. Listen to me, all right? You can't take a risk like that again. Do you understand? Okay, I won't. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah, sure. - Do you blame me? - What? Do you blame me? Of course I don't blame you, you know that. What is wrong with you? Just keep your head screwed on. I'm trying, I just need to know something about what's going on back home. Nothing good. I saw my picture. It was-- Wait, you saw your picture? What, you've been online? No. Where did you see it, then? - A newspaper. - Oh, for fuck's sake! They were on display outside the shop. Nobody saw me. - I didn't go in. - For your own good, you've got to stay away from people. We discussed this already. I know we did. I just had to do something. You can't. You have to stay in. I'm trying. I do appreciate everything you've done. Good. Because I'm in as much trouble as you if we're found out. I'll be more careful. Look, just stay away from the TV and the internet and don't make any phone calls. I'll see if I can get you next week. Next week? I can't do earlier than that. I think they might be watching me. Can you tell me anything else? No. Now just stay inside. Do not leave the house. William. What's the matter with you? I don't know. Right. Well. You planning on getting out of bed anytime soon? It's nearly lunchtime. I guess I'll get up. Don't forget to make the bed. Remember, last one up rules apply. Yeah, sure. I'm, uh-- I'm just going to head to the shed. The shed? The shop, William. I'm going to go to the shop. Do you need anything? No thanks. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye. You forgot your phone. Hey, you forgot your phone. Whatever happens... we can get through this together. What are you doing here? You looked like you needed the company. -I thought you were-- -Dead? What happened? I-- I wasn't sure if it was-- Real. I mean, I can understand your reasoning there. It has been a complicated chain of events. You might as well have a seat. This is a nice... cozy little abode. Is it yours? A friend's. Must be a good friend. He is. Or at least he was before all of this. They say alone time is good for the soul. But too much can lead you down a dark path. They're getting closer, you know. Who? You don't know that. I do. And you've come to warn me? Well I've no interest in warning you about anything. Then what? Quite the scene of carnage left behind. Not exactly a trail of breadcrumbs, but... only a matter of time. Do you have any idea right now... what's going on? No. Really? Oh, you poor, poor boy. What a number this has done on your brain. But you do know. Deep down, you know. Maybe you could tell me what I'm supposed to know. We could have this conversation a thousand times and it wouldn't change a thing. There are no answers when you're not interested in what's real. -I know what's real. -No you don't. I see things. Out there in the woods. -People. -Oh, yes. They're always out there watching me. Well, they're-- they're part of this now. But they're not real. And neither are you. I can assure you this is very real. I'm not a figment of your imagination and neither are they. You can't run from the truth and you can't solve this by causing harm to yourself. Yes, I know about that. And I can assure you, it would solve nothing. It would put an end to my suffering. Leaving that thing outside, alone. It would start all over again. It won't be like before. It's locked away. If you believe that, you're in more trouble than I thought. I think you should go now. It's going to happen again. And it's going to keep on happening again unless you do what needs to be done. We'll suffer because of you. -I-- -Uh. Think on it. It's really you. Who else would it be? I don't know. I really don't know. And what exactly do you think you need to know? You shouldn't be here. This doesn't make sense. Hey. Are you all right? You look a bit sickly. This-- this isn't happening. You can't be here right now. Hmm? Why are you saying that? This place is dangerous. I don't see any danger. There's something outside in the woods. What? I didn't see anything on the drive up here. There are these people. -They're-- -Okay, look, William, you need to calm down. Everything's okay. I thought I'd lost you. Of course you didn't lose me. Don't be silly. You need to relax more. I'm always telling you that. You're going to make yourself unwell. I've felt better. Maybe you should go see a doctor. I don't need a doctor. Okay. Okay. Where are you going? Just to the car. No. -What? -This isn't right. It's not normal. Life is not like it was. What is wrong with you? Something's wrong. You shouldn't be here. Oh, okay, enough now, William. You're getting yourself into a state. Everything's fine. I can't let bad things happen again. They won't. Look. We'll just have a nice time, yeah? Forget about everything else. Sound good? This place is pretty dusty. Have you been cleaning? Not really. You been getting out much? Couple of times. I need to keep out of sight. Why? You don't know? Of course you know. Maybe we should go for a walk later. -I'm not going to the village. -I didn't say the village. We have to keep clear of people. Okay. We'll walk in the fields then. I just don't understand it. Understand what? Hey, you got any coffee? Top shelf. Same as always. You want one? -Uh, maybe not. -You know, I was thinking on the way over here, we should really get a proper machine, just something we can bring with us when we come. You're always complaining about the coffee when we get here, so it'd solve that problem. Hm. Oh, and I was going to drive over to the superstore tomorrow, just pick up a few bits and pieces. I assume you've been living off of deer and take away without me, so I thought maybe I could make us a proper dinner. Hey, why don't you come sit with me? You know, I can't even remember the last time I saw you. Pretty strange, don't you think? You've been under a lot of pressure. It's understandable. -Is it, though? -Of course. You're-- you're too hard on yourself. I'm sure it was the trip. Yeah, yeah, I think it was. But it can't be, I know I've seen you since then. I don't think that you need to worry about this right now. The last time I saw you, something happened. You don't remember that? I don't know what you're talking about. It-- it was bad. I don't know what, but it-- it was serious. You're not well, William. -Can you stop saying that? -You need to stop this. And how did we leave things? -Leave what things? -Between you and me. -What does that matter? -I want you to tell me how we left things between you and me. Like normal, I suppose. But if the trip was the last time I saw you, that was, what, two months ago? Yeah, something like that. That can't be the last time we spoke. I think it probably was. Two months since we last spoke and that seems normal to you? We haven't spoken for two whole months. Have you got your medication here with you, William? Medication? I am not on any medication. -What are you doing? -We need to go inside, now. You hear that? What? Silence. Same as it always is. I was hearing things before at night. What, more of your rabid squirrels, was it? Have you ever thought there was such a thing as a perfect moment? Of course. Beside perfect, you just wanted to relive it again and again, even though you knew it wasn't real anymore. We don't need to relive anything. There's something going on here. I don't know what... but that thing is out there in the woods... and we're just here, you and me, together. Uh, you've lost me with that. I remember something else from the trip. You got hurt. I got hurt? No, no, that's not right. You must be imagining things. We were out hiking and that's when it happened. I think you're confused, William. We came back and you were okay, but then... I can't remember. We're here now. That's all that matters. Things are different. Everything's changed. All I've ever done is try to protect you. I know. And I love you for that. If I can hold you right now, I mean... really hold you... then maybe all that other stuff will just go away. Maybe it was just a bad dream. I love you so much. Chantelle? William. William. William. William. - Hello? - Will? What the fuck? I've been ringing all morning. I was outside. Listen, it's all over the news. Three people have been killed near the cottage. - What? - Escaped, ain't it? Will? Yeah. Oh, shit. There's a massive search going on. They're going to find you. They know about the cottage? No, but you're going to have to get out of there. Where can I go? Well, I honestly don't know. I can't leave. I have to find it. Will, listen to me. That thing out there is not Chantelle. What did you just say? That thing, it's not her anymore. You got to let it go. I'm here alone. Will, you're losing it, all right? I brought you there weeks ago. You did? You called me to help you find her that night. I got you both out of there. I brought you to the cottage. You'll be smart here, Will. You need to listen to me. I'm sorry, John. It won't happen again. Please. Please, we can't let it happen again. No, I don't want to change. Hello? Hello? - Hi. - Who is that? It's William. William. My God. Where are you? I can't tell you. The police-- Everybody's looking for you. I know. Are you with Chantelle? I need to talk to you. Is she safe? William, will you please just tell me if she's safe? I don't-- What-- what's happened? Where's my daughter? That's all my fault. Is she alive? Please, just tell me she's alive. I have to deal with it now. What do you mean? William, tell me what that means. I'm sorry. Tell me where she is. You tell me where she is. I'm so, so sorry. It's your own fault you suffer. You think I don't know that? No, I think now you do. The trip we took was my idea. What happened to her was my fault. Ah, these little moments of fate that bring us crashing down to where we are. We argued that day. But I never meant what I said. It's such a terrible, terrible tragedy. Whatever it was that attacked us started all of this. Yes. I promised... I'd always take care of her. But you didn't. You didn't deal with anything. And look where that got you. If I could just hold her one more time and tell her that I'm sorry. Now, she's not what you remember. You know there is only one thing left to do. You saw that others have died. And that's on you. It was locked away. I thought it was secure. You were wrong. And it won't be long until they find it. Maybe it's good that they find it. Maybe they can put an end to it all. More will die. Only you can stop that. I don't think I can. It's back in the barn now. I hear it. I can't. You must. I look pretty. Don't you think? My fate... the same as the rest of them. It's in the drawer over there. Take it. It's a full moon tonight. She doesn't deserve this. She wouldn't have wanted to end up like that. Think of it as a kindness. They're almost there. Now is the time. You have to help me, William. Please. Please. It isn't over yet, you know? It is. I did it. Just one more thing. She did that not long after you first arrived. Sorry to say you've got the same fate coming to you. That's not possible. Well, you'll change, just like she did. But at least you're the last one. You can break the chain. Um... best to use that before it happens. There's no other way. Bastard.
