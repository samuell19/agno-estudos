In 1754, the American territory around the Great Lakes was a prize sought by both England and France. The Indians, as a matter of preservation, were forced to take sides. And once friendly tribes became bitter enemies. The peaceful Mohicans had formed an alliance with the English while the warlike Mingos, a branch of the Iroquois under Chief Arrowhead, had thrown their lot in with the French. And bad blood existed between the two tribes. Togamak, reach to fort, the English will send soldiers to help. Uncas? KaLetan? Maybe you didn't like moving your tribe further west, Chingachgook. But you can't say these forests are short of food. And not short of French and Mingos. As long as the Mingos stayed by the Great Water, you can stop-- Smoke. Much fire! - Pathfinder! - Easy! They may still be around. - Mingos! - Uncas, KaLetan? They may still be alive. KaLetan? Uncas? KaLetan? - KaLetan? Uncas? - Chingachgook? - KaLetan? - Chingachgook? - Chingachgook? - Uncas. Mingos, Chingachgook, they killed KaLetan. They killed everyone, my son. You will be the last of our people. KaLetan sent Togamak to the fort but the English did not come. So that's what our treaty meant with the English? We fight for them but they will not fight for us. Bury your dead, Chingachgook. - Where you go? - To break a treaty! All right, Colonel. - Pathfinder? - Get up. I'm going to give you more of a chance than you gave the Mohicans. The Mohicans? I don't know what you're talking about. Get up. But you can't kill a man in this night shirt? What's eating at you? Mohicans sent to you for help today. - But you didn't even-- - To me? - I never have the word. - Help! Help! Colonel Duncannon. - Togamak. - Your Mohican messenger. Get him inside, quick. No use, Pathfinder. Mingos. He said he wanted to see the Colonel. He wasn't here earlier? I haven't seen him since he came in for salt over a month ago. Then Duncannon was telling the truth. I'm certainly glad you found out in time. You're not usually so hotheaded, Pathfinder. What happened? Mohicans were wiped out today. The only one still alive are Uncas and Chingachgook. Better bring them in to the fort. We've received word today that war has been declared between England and France. He will be all alone. Oh, no, no, no. The women in the Fort Plain will take good care of Uncas. I promise you. But the French and Mingos are many. You cannot hold this fort. Aye, you're right. We cannot hold them. I once made you an offer to join us, but you turned me down. I was brought up by the Indians, Duncannon. The white men are taking their lands. Neither you nor the French had enough gold for me to act as guide for your armies. I did not want you as a guide. Pathfinder, you can save this fort and all the women and children in it. With one rifle? Look here. The French have anticipated this war for a long time. They've build many forts around the Lakes. Now the lifeline of the string of forts is St. Vicente. All the French supplies come over land then are shipped out in one large sailing vessel, which delivers them. Now, if St. Vicente were destroyed or in British hands, the rest of the string of forts would wither on the vine for lack of supplies. It is the only way we can hold this territory and this fort. You have a lot of faith in deer slayer. No. You both want to strike a blow at the Mingos as well as the French. This is your chance. The Mingos have set up their camp at St. Vicente to ally their forces with the French troops. You see, the French once offered you gold to be a guide for them. Well... you can take that job. What would you want us to find out? How many troops the French's have got, the number of their canon and their plans of defense. Me not understanding a word of French. But there's someone here who will help, speaks French like a native. What do you say? Arrowhead and these Mingos are at St. Vicente. This is the way to fight them, Chingachgook. Then we fight, best we can. If we get this information, we stand a good chance of taking St. Vicente. Call in your man who speaks French. Good. Orderly, bring Alison. And hurry. I'm sorry it took a war to bring you over to our side, Pathfinder. Heh, but now that you are here, heh, there's a little more hope in my soul about ever getting back to bonnie Scotland. A tot of rum to seal the bargain. This interpreter, it will take a man who can keep his mouth closed and who can handle a gun, if necessary. Heh, your drink, lad. It's the finest rum. I'm going to have to trust this man, Colonel. You know, he can't have the scattered-brain mind of a woman. Colonel Duncannon, you wanted to see me? Aye. Uh, this is Alison. Uh, Miss Welcome Alison. Your interpreter. Duncannon is going to make his camp near the river so we can get information to him in a hurry. Now you got your own story straight? Well, let's hear it. Mais oui. My name is Paulette Dessoir. I was on my way to the settlement at St. Vicente when my party was attacked by a band of Delaware. I was the only one saved. I was rescued by a polite gentleman called Monsieur Pathfinder who thinks all women are-- All right! All right! I guess your memory is good enough. Thank you. Why did you ever accept a job like this? - Why not? - You're a woman. Excellent. I'd heard your eyes were sharp. - Now look. - You look, Mister Pathfinder. I'm not a child nor are all women scattered-brain idiots. So that's what's bothering you. I'm English. That's my reason for taking this job. Now is there anything else? Yeah. Why aren't you having a flock of kids like other women? Unfortunately, women can only marry men. Now since we've a mutual dislike for each other, this should be a most workable business arrangement. You don't have to ask me any questions, and I won't question you. Just what is it you have against men? That's a question, I presume. Yeah. Be ready to leave by dawn. And you better take along a cookbook, ma'am, just in case we have to fight a few Mingos. Owls? Could be owls! Could be Mingos! Perhaps if I talk to them in French. Mingos shoot first, listen to talk later. Know how to handle this? I could probably hit you at this distance. That's about what I expected. It wasn't an owl. How do you reload this thing? Don't tell me you've never used one before? Of course not! What's so difficult? You just point and pull the trigger. Men just like to make a fuss about these things. Use this while I reload the pistol. You did that on purpose. Go through there. Get around back. Get down. This is no position for a lady but you're no good to me dead. Get down and stay down. That too! They won't find us now, will they? Still keep looking. Well, I'm gonna get some sleep. It's bit noisy for sleeping. All right! Big, strong man, now what? Get out your cookbook, may be that will help. Well, how can you hit what you can't see? That one stepped on a twig. Man even shoots with his ears. Chingachgook! - Relax. - Well, how can you relax at a time like this? They won't attack Pathfinder at night. - I've seen all kinds of conceited-- - We're going to make them! Your conceit is really the most colossal-- You're going to what? We got to find out how many there are. They all don't step on twigs. - He's not going to build a fire? - Yep. But they'll see us. Yep. Pathfinder! Pathfinder is dead. Pathfinder! You can't die and leave me alone. You can't die here. Can you think of a better place? Go back behind that far tree. Take my gun and reload it. Take the powder, would you? All right. - What was he doing? - He told them I'm in that grave. - They will be coming soon. - Why? For my scalp. There's none they'd rather wear in their belts. - They will dig up that grave and-- - Quite clear, thank you. I guess that's all of them. I've never seen anything so grisly in my life. It would have been a lot worse, ma'am, if I really was in that grave. Maybe you'd rather go back to Fort Blaine. No. Mingos probably left their canoes at the lake. We'll use one of them to go the rest of the way. You'll stay here and act as our contact with Duncannon. I'll be glad to see civilized people again, even if they are French. You better get some sleep. - Where did you get it? - That Mingo won't need it. Mingo? I didn't thank you for the blanket last night. Of course, not much from a roof over your head. That Mingo hadn't died last night you would have been mighty cold. That's what you live by in the forest, isn't it? Dog eat dog. Oh, it's simple, maybe. There aren't too many things you have to find out about a man that way, with women, there's always a lot to find out. Even with squaws. Are you going to question me? No, it ain't necessary. I know enough. Do you? You didn't think I'd take you along without learning about you. And what did you learn? You're feeling mighty sorry for yourself, for one thing. I--? From one of those old English families, traveled all the way to Fort Blaine, to marry a young English captain, you'd known back in London. When you got here, found out he had taken to drink, rum, deserted and became a renegade. Then you know all about Captain Bradford. A renegade English captain named Bradford married the daughter of Tuscarora chief. I'd expect you'd be madder than a hornet. Glad to be rid of him. Captain Bradford could have gone far if he hadn't come to this country. Maybe. Maybe your kind of civilization would have protected him. But you are a fair hand in the forest, ma'am. The likes of Bradford shouldn't fret you none. Thank you. But if come out of this alive, I'm going back to London. Mingos recognize me, may be a little trouble. He's Pathfinder. Mohican brave. - You die. - Watch him, Sergeant. Well. To what do I owe the honor for the visit from my old friend, l'ennemi Pathfinder? Him, Mohican. Calm yourself, mon ami, he's not going to kill any Mingos here. What is this? His tribe wiped out the Mohicans. Yes, I know. One of the sad things of the war, the Mohicans, the English, they would do the same to us, if they were strong enough. But if I-- Sacrebleu, what am I overlooking? Thousand pardon, mademoiselle, I thought I knew every woman in St. Vincente. I brought her here, colonel. Maybe we could go and pow-wow some place in private. Of course, of course, she has the depth of fire of old wine, Pathfinder. Where do you find such things in the forest? That's the whole story. Delaware war party gave up looking for it. Well, I found her in that old cave, she, uh, sure didn't look like old wine. Mon petit chéri, It could only have been fate that spared you alone of your entire party from the Delawares, and they allowed you to spread your radiant sunshine. You no make friend with Mohican. These people are guests of this post, Chief Arrowhead. One more misdeed and I shall question your ability to fight on the side of France. Pathfinder knows I am a strong chief. Let Pathfinder defend himself in my camp by the river. My friends are most distressed. You almost lost yourself a guide, colonel. A guide? C'est magnifique! This indeed calls for a pow-wow. I'll return this later. Needless to say, mademoiselle, you shall be a most delightful addition to our outpost. Now about your sudden decision to become a guide for the French. Well, the English are going to be driven out the territory. The forest is where I live. I can't afford to be on the losing side. Besides, little Paulette's gotten to be kind of, uh, personal responsibility. Ah, l'amour. This l'amour must be quite a word. What did she say? No. She could get into a pack of trouble taking that long to say no. Now you are working for France as a guide, Monsieur Pathfinder, because we need a guide very badly. Your first duty would be a constant inspection of the area. We do not want to be caught by surprise. Now I will show you to your quarters. Show the lady, monsieur. I'm going down to Mingo camp. It will be dangerous for you. This business has got to be settled, ma'am. But will be settled? Maybe we don't have judges, barristers and courts, but the forest has a law of its own. - Even the Mingos lived by it. - He is right. I have seen this forest code before, we can't change these people, mademoiselle. - I shall go also. - No. No. No. Should I go alone? Or you will accompany me? As you wish. I come to Arrowhead's camp to learn if he has the courage of which he speaks. I will give you a chance to take Pathfinder's scalp. If you fail, your tribe is to honor me. It is agreed? Mohican have honor if he lives. I give you your life, Arrowhead. I will not wear your scalp on my belt, rule your people and see that they do not bother me. The Mohican will be honored by my tribe. Since you are going to be our guide, it's good that you won the respect of my troops and the Indians, Pathfinder. I let Arrowhead live, that was a sign of weakness. You regret the instinct of a civilized human being. You two, you have all the quarrels of lovers without any of the pleasures. Voila, we are here. This is for you, mademoiselle. I trust you'll find it quite comfortable. - Merci, monsieur. - Thanks, colonel. Being as how my talk and my ways aren't much entertainment for the lady, maybe you could arrange for her to meet some of the folks, - uh, party-- - Excellent. Tonight, we'll arrange you a soiree. But I'm afraid my clothes were-- Oh, you will have all the clothes you need. I shall see about it immediately. Mademoiselle. Monsieur. I supposed you think all a woman wants are parties. Now what do you think you're doing? When are you going to stop taking up a Tomahawk - every time you talk to me? - Does it make any difference? Yeah. That make you feel any better. Make me feel better? Sure. It's what you want, isn't it? Or maybe you don't know it. I do believe you've lost your mind. Welcome, you're sore at all men because that captain of yours showed such bad judgment by walking out on you to marry an Indian girl. - Think maybe you're growing old. - Old? You're not so pretty anymore. And not pleasing to the eyes of men. Since I didn't pay you much, never mind it kind of make matters worse. Well, me kissing you should tell you it isn't so. You're right pleasing to the eye. Well. Frenchman might have told you nicer, ma'am, but I'm the one who kissed you. Plenty of practice from the Indian girls, no doubt. Some of them make mighty fine practicing, ma'am. Pathfinder, I told you when we started this job-- It isn't for me. I just wanted to prove to you that you could charm all the Frenchman at that soiree tonight. - How clever you are. - Sure. That's why I suggested the party. The ship they send supplies on is in port, which means there's a supply train heading this way. Enough of your charm, and you could find out all there is to know about that train. And I'm supposed to thank you for restoring my confidence, hmm? - It would be polite. - Well, let me restore your confidence, my friend. You are a savage, an unmitigated abysmal savage. You should have killed Arrowhead and taken his scalp, it would be more natural to you. Remember, ma'am, will be needing that information about the train. Ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Quite a soiree, yup. Quite a soiree, ma'am. Excuse me, colonel, reckon I'll be getting back to my cabin. So soon? Quite a nice party, sir. Thanks for taking care of the lady. But mademoiselle, the soiree just... Where is she? Did she leave without you? I reckon she won't be wanting for company. Tell her I said goodnight. Pathfinder? Come in. I'm glad you are awake. Why are you? Guns aren't like human beings, ma'am, they are reliable if you take care of them. Meaning guns are preferable. - Have a nice walk? - I didn't think you'd notice. Yes, delightful, thanks, most entertaining young man. - I'm right glad for you, ma'am. - Oh, stop calling me ma'am. Using a woman isn't my kind of fighting. Maybe the party was my idea. Maybe it was a mistake. But you didn't have to go lollygagging with that-- Well, you do have human instincts. You're jealous, Pathfinder. There is hope for you after all. - Needn't concern you. - Oh, the information I learned. - What did you find out? - The supply train will reach Wenatchee Ridge on Thursday. Wenatchee Ridge? That bridge has never been crossed. French engineers have built a road along the cliff wall. Even the Indians have never crossed Wenatchee. Point for civilization, shall we say? It's valuable information, ma'am. You must have really charmed that lieutenant. What right have you to be jealous? Don't know as I am, ma'am. Maybe it's... Maybe I shouldn't have kissed you. Man can become discontented with things he has. So you decided to take up the Tomahawk against me. I didn't know we had anything in common. Maybe we do, ma'am. Welcome. There's gentleness in you, Pathfinder, and kindness. They may even be more of these than cruelty one day. Perhaps we both have something to look forward to. Do be careful. If I can keep my wits about me. What do you think you'll do? We got to find the way to stop that train from coming over the ridge. Duncannon will have more of a chance if we can't stop those supplies from getting St. Vicente. I'll have to go find Chingachgook. You better get started. All I had to do, Pathfinder, was smile at the lieutenant. Your bird whistle very good but Eagle Feather still think you Pathfinder. Arrowhead's still suspicious. He must have follow me from the settlement. Pathfinder not listening. I was thinking too hard. The French have built a road along Wenatchee. - Wenatchee bad medicine. - A big supply train is going by tomorrow. - No time to tell English colonel. - No. Suppose there were no road. We can blow a hole in it. Trouble is we need gun powder. Brasseau has that arsenal guarded like-- - We kill guard. - No, too many. If we can only find a way to make them open it... Chingachgook, I think our old friend Arrowhead sent us a key. I don't understand. Clean this off. Put yellow stripes on it. Feathers on both sides. And let the French find it in Eagle Feather's body. Ah, I understand very well. We find clay down by the river. Right. It was Eagle Feather who was killed, sir. We found his body on the edge of the settlement with this Indian knife in his back. I've never seen this kind of striping before. - Have you? - No, sir, never. You sent for Arrowhead? Yes, sir. He will be here in a moment. This is not a Mingo weapon. - Who could've killed him? - I don't know, sir. The sentries didn't see a thing. Eagle Feather dead. And this did it. Delaware knife? Delaware? In this territory, are you sure? Delaware knife. I see many times. Maybe Eagle Feather must see war party. Try to come back to warn French. The British could be bringing the Delawares into this territory. - Sound the guard, sergeant. - Yes, sir. Wait. Delaware not attack at night. Only when sun God come over mountain, want sun God to see brave deed. There's too much at stake here to take any chances. - I want all defenses manned. - Yes, sir. Sounds like Colonel Brasseau has a healthy respect for the Delawares. Get the horse, I'll meet you here. I'm going in. Pathfinder. - You saw Chingachgook? - Yes. What's this about the Delaware? Go to sleep and cover your head. Now go away. But the Delawares? There is not a Delaware within 200 miles of here. Everything goes all right and I'll be back by tomorrow night. - And if it doesn't. - Don't worry about it. I've got to see Brasseau. Try to find out in the morning how he plans his advance. Go. - Pathfinder. - Where have you been? The English must have put a big bee in the bonnet of the Delawares. Oh, mean critters, those Delawares, they torture a man first then scalp him. It has taken all my life to grow this. I'll get this filled and then do some scouting. Maybe I can locate them before they hit us. Bien. Find them. We will attack first. Smart strategy, Colonel. Got to work fast. if we want to reach Wenatchee in time. Sun God is sunning himself for three hours by now, and the only things we have to fight are the birds and chipmunks. - Are you sure about that knife? - See it many times. Where's Pathfinder? Out, scouting Delawares. If there are Delawares, probably he's dead by now. That renegade Bradford is bringing in the delegation from the Tuscarora tribe this afternoon to talk about to join the alliance. I'll be at my quarters. If anything happens here, call me at once. There it is. French are smart. British never would've found this road. We fix now. We'll leave the horse here. - We haven't much time. - Look. Men on the trail. Fire a shot over their heads to see if they're friendly. What a time to figure out how to turn around. The war will be over. Come on. I know. But I'm afraid I have no talent for the military. Oh, you must have other talents. Perhaps, you would have the time to instruct me in the art of, uh, soldiering. Oh, mademoiselle. You are just as unpredictable as the Delawares. And you. I thought you are going to be my very good friend. Oh, mais oui. It would be my pleasure. But military matters are unromantic, Paulette. Plans for defenses, disposition for troops, supplies, arms, these are secret things. And officer cannot show them or discuss such things openly. I understand, monsieur. And I'm glad to see that you are a man of discretion. Then perhaps tonight, you and I... Ah, the Tuscarora tribe. They will expect a conference immediately. - Of course, I'll go. - No. No. But you must meet this Captain Bradford. - Most interesting scandal. - Please, no. No, I insist. Colonel Brasseau, I'm Captain Bradford. Captain Bradford. May I present our Chief Talimi. His sons Montu and Deleka. And his daughter... my wife, Lokawa. It's a pleasure to meet so many friends of France. This is Mademoiselle Dessoir. It's a pleasure for me to also meet a friend of France, Mademoiselle Dessoir. I will be the spokesman for the Tuscaroras, colonel. If you will excuse me. We shall see. This way please. I tell you your father doesn't understand these Frenchman. Brasseau will meet my terms. He can't afford not to. He can't buy my support with beads and promises, it will take gold. Enough gold so that I can live in London as an English gentleman should. You let my people fight so you can have gold. I meant so we can have gold, Lokawa. You'll go to London with me. You'll become a great lady. You promise to take Lokawa? - You promise? - Of course, my sweet. Now I'm going to have a look around the town. - Lokawa go too. - No. You stay here. Welcome. I never thought I should find you in a French settlement, Welcome. In fact, I was wondering when our paths would ever cross again. - Get out. - Not yet, my dear. I have to first determine if I shall tell Brasseau who you are. - Now perhaps we should talk. - And if I don't choose to talk? It makes no difference. But it really seems preposterous that the haughty delicate Welcome Alison should be a, heh, most objectional word, spy. Will you go now? Angry because I didn't wait at Fort Blaine for you? So that you could tell me how low I'd sunk. But you see how wrong you'd have been. I really did quite well. My wife is a princess. I don't care to hear about it. Well, I must admit that both you and London have never quite lost that fascination for me. I expect to have considerable gold shortly. We could go back to England together you and I. Clint, if I could, I'd kill you. Brasseau said that you were brought here by Pathfinder. You know one little word and you both die before a firing squad. However I see no need for such harsh measures, I could be induced to keep your secret quite intact. I'd be quiet if I were you, my dear. Clint, in heaven's name. One word of this, and I go to Brasseau. Come in. Uh, Pathfinder this is Captain Bradford. Captain Bradford. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night, sir. Mademoiselle Dessoir. We can't stay here. Not with him around. He won't say anything. You seem very sure. He still wants me, Pathfinder. And you, ma'am? We have a duty to Colonel Duncannon and to the Mohicans. I'm not forgetting our duty. Since you seem to have so much influence with Captain Bradford, maybe you could find a way to stop the Tuscaroras from signing a treaty with the French. Please believe me, I don't love Clint. We stopped the supply train at Wenatchee. You don't believe me. As you said, ma'am, we've other things to worry about. When the supplies don't reach here, Brasseau will draw troops and supplies from the other ports to strengthen this garrison. Duncannon has got to have our information so he can attack before that happens. I tried to get it this afternoon, all I could find out was that Brasseau may have the plans of the defenses in his quarters. No matter what happens, don't go near the Mingo camp tomorrow night. But what can happen? The less you know the less trouble Bradford can get you into. Pathfinder. Much thought in here. Yeah, much thought. You worry about Mingo camp tonight? We talked about living like white man wants. We were wrong. It's no good for us. This is where we belong. Squaw trouble. We've enough now. Squaw much trouble but better than horse to do work. Not have to shoot when break leg. We'll wait till they start eating. Gun powder. - What do you want here? - I must talk with you, Lokawa. Come. Well, what do you want here? Lokawa, your husband came to my cabin last night. Lokawa see. I don't want it to happen again. And I think it's best that you know how I feel. How I know you tell truth? I'm in love with another man, Lokawa. Is that answer enough? Not good ending squaw love white man. You should've kept him in your village. He say he make much gold from French, take me to white man city. But many of my people be killed. If the Tuscaroras join the French? He make my father take up hatchet against English. Has the treaty been signed yet? My husband not sign until colonel pay gold. But your father's chief. He could keep your people neutral and then they wouldn't be killed. My father once strong chief. But now I don't know. He could be strong again. Maybe he listen to me. You go now. What are you doing here? Why, Clint, I thought you'd be glad to see me. You were last night. Get out. She loves you, Clint. What did she want? Can't talk? Red pig. - Be careful. - If die, take plenty Mingos. It's that new guy, Pathfinder. Open the gate. - Bomb sounds good, huh. - Very good. What is it? What's happening? It might be the Delaware attack, sir. - But those sounded like cannon. - They're English cannon maybe. Close to the Mingo camp, from the sound of it. Chingachgook. His whole plan of defense, everything is here. Get it to Duncannon, tell him to attack as fast as possible. Wait! This way. Don't. Drop it. Now outside. Summon Colonel Brasseau at once. When I came in the drawers were all open and the papers were scattered about. And some very important papers are missing from my desk, monsieur. You've had us both searched. The Indian who brought logs into the Mingo camp was undoubtedly your confederate. I must surmise that he escaped with the plans. I have no alternative... you both came here as spies you will dies as spies. - The lady had not-- - Monsieur. It is against my very character to destroy anything beautiful... but my country comes first, mademoiselle. Sergeant, Miss Dessoir will be held in her quarters on the guard. Take him to the guard house. You have until dawn to make peace with your savior. I'm sorry. I'm such a lazy creature, Pathfinder. I shall hate rising at dawn. It would help if you can sleep, mademoiselle. Could you, sergeant? Ah, monsieur. Sometimes it is no good to think too much. Or perhaps you think the lady, she is looking at the stars also. Funny, now I can think of all those things I should've said to her. Reckon it would've made us both feel better. What time is it? Almost 4:00. 'Bout two hours. Squad, halt. Firing squad is ready sir. Forward turn! What are your orders, sir? Pathfinder and Welcome are still in the town. Pathfinder say you attack. When I signal, fire a barrage. the troops will charge simultaneously. Yes, sir. Squad, halt. Charge. Notify the Captain Valmy to take all the women and children aboard the ship. He's to weigh anchor and escape to Fort de Coteau. - Yes, sir. - Wait. Get the British girl aship too. We'll deal with her later. Come along, come along. Get back there. I was ordered to deliver this prisoner to you, captain. I know about her. I'll take charge of the prisoner. Yes, sir. Monsieur, no one is permitted to board except women and children. Can't you see the British on the streets of the town? As an Englishman, you seem to be afraid of the English. Get off this ship! Get back there. We're getting out of here. Weigh anchor. Get underway, I said. See you still have your hair. We've won, Pathfinder, the battle is over. Reckon there's one fight not over yet, colonel. Care to settle it now, ma'am? Reckon so, if we can do it in private. Good. Yes. Much better than horse.
