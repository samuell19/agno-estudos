They are only 10 kilometers. the Istra reservoir and river it's a good line of defense and it is much more advantageous for us. The troops have suffered heavy casualties. Soldiers do not stand up from exhaustion. To withdraw is to undertake the withdrawal, Cda. Rokossovsky! No, not one step back! Endure to the last! Will you allow me to retire? Are you sure we will retain Moscow? I ask him with the pain of my heart. Comrade Zh kov, Answer me frankly as a communist. I think we will retain Moscow. But we need 2 armies and 200 tanks at least. I'm glad you're so sure. Call Edo. Major General and agree with them where to concentrate the armies that you request. They will be ready by the end of November, but for now I can't give him tanks. Be clear. It will concentrate the armies on the flanks. See you later, Comrade Stalin. EDO. OLDER THAN 16 ARMY. November 19, 1941. Zh kov did not accept my proposal.

He reaffirmed his personal responsibility. for the fate of the entire Western Front. I have known Zh kov for twenty years. Assume colossal responsibility. before all the Soviet people. And if you are wrong about something, at its core it does: You cannot take a step back, Moscow is behind us. You have to fight to the last. WOLFSSOHANZE. November 19, 1941. Field Marshal von Bok personally leads, from the command post, the battle of Moscow. As in the Battle of Marne, a single battalion can solve the fate of the contest. Tell Bok to stop the frontal attacks and Try to go around Moscow, especially in the north. And don't forget about the mediate goals: Yaroslavl, R binsk and, perhaps, V logda. Inform Bok that, in his honor, We plan to give Smolensk the name of Bokburg. And despite the huge losses, the troops of the army group "Centro" They continued their attacks against Moscow. In the Kri kovo Istra regions, Naro-Fominsk, Yakhrom were engaged in fierce fighting. MOSCOW. KM 25. BUS STOP. Next stop: "Red Square" When will the bus come, it seems to be late! It was! Let's keep going! Moscow Soviet? Please inform Comrade Stalin: the Germans are in Kr snaya Poliana ... EDO. OLDER THAN 16 ARMY. November 24, 1941. The Supreme Commander is speaking. You know. than in the Kr snaya Poliana region Enemy units appeared? What measures are being taken? We are aware. We ship there forces from other sectors. Headquarters arranged to send him reinforcements. Ma ana Kr snaya Poliana should be taken. Heavy artillery can open fire on the Kremlin. Very good, general. Now show me Moscow about the binoculars. The Russians fight back, we must retreat! Yes, but I saw Moscow. Maybe the last time. EDO. SENIOR OF THE ARMY. November 25, 1941. Hey everyone! �Camaradas! �Hermanos! For our great homeland, for our Moscow, go ahead! Rokossovsky, with an impetuous counterattack, expelled the enemy from Kr snaya Poliana. The long-range piece battle that was brewing to open fire on Moscow that was taken. Western Front MS. November 29, 1941. German troops were rejected from Dm trov. and expelled beyond the channel. It is time to launch a counterattack. Are you sure that the enemy entered a state of crisis? The enemy is exhausted. And if we don't settle the dangerous wedges now, the enemy can reinforce his troops with new reserves. And so the situation can get even more complicated. The time has come to start the counter-offensive. I will advise with the Edo. Major General. How does it feel? Thanks, better, the crisis is over. The disease is the offensive of the microbes, it is a war. If the crisis passed, launch the counterattack and annihilate enemies with pills. I have huge reserves of those pills ... Going to war, by analogy, I want to tell you that Zh kov believes that the state of crisis of the Western Front is already behind. I also think that it is time to prepare a good compress to the Germans. Understood, Bor s Mij ilovich, get better. Thank you, Comrade Stalin. Say the following order: from today, November 29, subordinate to Zh kov the 1st shock army and armies 10 and 20 Army Group EM "CENTRO". November 29th. Again we must try to attack in the direction of Kr snaya Poliana. It is the closest point to Moscow. 16 kilometers to the Jimki river port. We have to attack! We must crush Moscow's last defenses. The 7th Armored Corps will attack December 1 on the Minsk highway. Agree. The 20th Army Corps will attack on December 1 in Naro Fominsk. Western Front MS. December 1, 1941. By taking off their clusters on a wide front and by stretching their armored fists on the flanks, the enemy, in the fighting of the accesses to Moscow, has lost the shock force. Enemy communications suffer guerrilla attacks. The great casualties of Hitler's troops and the fierce resistance of the Soviet soldiers they affected the fighting spirit of the Germans. Our troops have also had great losses. but all the time they have received help from the homeland and retain their combat capabilities. Trying to take advantage of favorable circumstances to us who have been created around Moscow, the Western Front command resolved to start the offensive. December 6, 1941. defeat the german shock groups. and drive them away from Moscow. How are we going to attack, comrades general? The Western Front does not have numerical superiority over the enemy. This has a greater number of tanks. That is the peculiarity of our counteroffensive. Well, what do you think? We believe that we must attack at night. An infantry day attack on the German tanks does not promise much success. In the dark it will be difficult for the enemy to orient himself. The superiority of the Germans must be reduced to zero in tanks and aircraft, prevent them from engaging in combat. You have to get closer to the enemy and force him to fight short, even, in hand-to-hand combat. How will I keep the address? Do you have a lighter? We will light two bonfires in the rear of the battalions, on the axis of the direction a kilometer away. If the Cdte. when he turns he sees the two fires together, is that they are going in the right direction. If they see them separated, it is that they lost their way. Okay, okay. The enemy advances towards K binka. Immediately settle the rupture! It was his last hit. The date remains unchanged: December 6. The 7th armored body attacked in "rhombus", classic combat formation of German units. In the vanguard, how far ahead, the T-4s marched. My tank army is over. Stand up! Go ahead! On December 5, the Kalinin Front went on the offensive. On December 6, at 6 a.m. sharp, Rifle units from armies 30, 1 and 20 of the Western Front. From the walls of Moscow the counter-offensive began of the Red Army all along the front. At dawn the defense of the enemy was broken. Mobile units developed success. VOLOKOLAMSK On December 8 they went on the offensive. G likov's 10th Army, Boldin's 50th Army and Belov's 1st Cavalry Corps. IASNAIA POLIANA. December 8, 1941. Frederick the Great said that Russian soldiers you have to kill them twice and then push them so that they finally fall. We have suffered a serious defeat. that, due to the stubbornness of the High Command, will lead to fatal consequences. Mr. General, the f hrer speaks to you. Guderian! Stay at any price! I'm sending reinforcements by plane! �Aguante! To order, my f hrer! He will not give the order to fight to the last! F hrer does not know the real situation! After big losses and withdrawals, the Red Army was in Moscow a devastating defeat to the German fascist troops. It was his first defeat in World War II. Near Moscow the Hitlerites lost more than 500 thousand soldiers, 1,300 tanks, 2,500 artillery pieces. The fascist army had not known such havoc. German troops were rejected 150 - 300 kilometers from Moscow. And the Red Army counteroffensive continued. �Bravo, Dov�tor! Bravo, the Guard!

Among them, the cities of: Kalinin, Klin, Solnechnog�rsk, St�ritsa, Volokolamsk, Mozh�isk, B�rovsk, Y�jnov, Maloyarosl�vets, Kaluga, Suj�nichi. We won't touch Bok when he failed in his mission of the "Barbarossa Plan". And now he sets out. Who gave the order to withdraw the troops from Moscow? Call Bok. we will destroy it and put Kl ge in its place. Llame the Guderian! Ll melos to all! Hitler removed Marshals Brauchitsch, Bok, Leeb, Rundstedt; to Generals Hepner, Guderian ... December 16, 1941 Stalin received a note from the President of the United States. Roosevelt escrib�a: "I want to inform you of the great enthusiasm for the victories "of his armies in defense of that great nation." We hear the echo of the distant stop, We dream the routes of the last attack. You are my hope, you are my joy. In my heart you are, my beloved Moscow ...
