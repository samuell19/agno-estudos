Ode to Nothing Damn it. Taho! Taho! Excuse me, ma'am. Have you looked inside the shop? Yes! So this doesn't come with flowers yet? The package you got doesn't include flowers. How much would it cost if there were flowers? It depends on how big the arrangement is. How big is it? Do you have something around three feet tall? This. This one's 300 pesos. Do you have anything cheaper? Here. I'll give this to you for 150 pesos. It's so small. Can I see this again? How about this one? That's 700 pesos. Maybe you can give this to us for free. We have two dead people. That's good for your business. Come on. All right. I'll give you the cheaper one for free. So you're giving me two of those, right? No, just one. But we have two dead people, remember? The other one might feel slighted. Can't you give each of them flowers? Fine, I'll take it. But give me your more expensive one. Ma'am, I don't usually give any of this out for free. So all the more, I can't throw in a more expensive one. Have a little bit of compassion, lady. We're in a time of grief and pain. We're burying two dead people. Two! Why don't you make it three? Then I'll give you the flowers for free! Here's my fare. Excuse me. Mister, here's my fare. Mister! What's going on? Sonya, I'm taking the piano. You can't take that away. So what else can I take? When are you going to pay me? Probably next week. Damn it! Your weeks have turned into months! Take that away, boys! Hold on. Please hold that for me. I'll come back next month. You're a waste of my gas. Anyone there? Anyone there? Just clean her up. Take her somewhere else. All the other funeral shops are closed at this time of hour. Bring her to the ER. She's already dead. And we don't want to take her there. Give her away when someone comes looking for her. Just don't tell them who brought her here. This isn't even enough. Here's some more. Besides, if someone claims the body, they will pay you to fix her up. I don't want to get involved in anything serious. You'll be fine as long as you don't tell anyone about this. My goodness! Are you trying to scare the shit out of me? I dare you one more time... Oh my gosh! Mister, you might want to avail yourself of our flowers. Here's our list. This one's only 300 pesos. This one's 800 pesos. But I can give this to you for only 700 pesos. Your package doesn't include flowers yet. You might want to get this, too. There. You might be feeling a little hot. You're bit of a mischief, aren't you? Till next time. Taho! Taho! Taho! Taho! Taho! Taho! Taho! You took an early nap. Here you go. I don't want you to think I'm heartless. Seems like business is doing good. Just one client a day. That's better than nothing. If I were you, I'd put a curse on all of my neighbors. Then you can pay me with the money you get from fixing up all the dead bodies. I don't know how to do that. I'll go ahead. When are you coming back? Whenever I want. It was only last week since you came here. So what? What about my land title? It's still with me. When can I get it back? When you learn how to put a curse on your neighbors. Just a little bit longer. Someone might knock on the door. So? Don't you have any more surprises up your sleeve? Theodor pulled a fast one on me. I was supposed to use the money to pay for the electricity. It's already past the due date. And to pay off the real estate taxes. Hey, I'm about to close up shop. Any more surprises for me? No more customers just like the other day? Are you still open? Why is the other one more expensive? The quality of the foam is better. What do my parents care about the foam? Give me your cheapest one. Do I need to provide the clothes? Yes, sir. Why are you calling me 'sir'? How old are you? 46. I'm 44. You look 43. Give me a discount. Aren't they such a sweet couple? They died three hours apart. When the man learned his wife died, he went into a heart attack. True love. Hey, you're full of surprises, aren't you? Wonderful surprises at that. Thank you. Taho! Taho! Thanks. Can I have a light? Taho, please! You know, Elmer's grandfather... has been dead for three years. So Elmer took over his grandfather's job as a taho vendor. I fixed up his grandfather. I took my chances earlier 'cause my birthday's coming up. Why not, right? Because that's the way it is. As you get older, you have more reasons to do the things you were afraid to do when you were younger. Or maybe that's just me. I'll buy from him again tomorrow. He might notice me this time. I really do hope he notices me. Stop it! You keep moving. Darn that annoying kid. Elmer already lent me his lighter. There you go. Beautiful! What's your name? Excuse me! What do you want? Mother! Thank you, but... She's not our mother. She might end up here. Here's her picture. Mother, where are you? Father, Maritess... I need to find our mother! Come on, let's go. I need to find our mother! Do you like music? Let me share this with you. Father doesn't know I'm afraid of the dark. I'm afraid to be all alone. But it would be much more frightening if I lose you again. Don't move too much. This will just be quick. It's only a bruise. Do you want coffee? Do you remember his face? How about his plate number? No, I didn't. Commander's going to kill me. The owner? How much did you lose? Around 1,200 pesos. I'm going to show you something. You should have cooked it a little longer. Do you want me to cook it again? She wants it a little more burnt. Why don't you ask her? Do you want me to cook it again? She said it's fine. I am thinking of cooking noodles for my birthday. Do you have any request? Just buy me roasted chicken from Andok's. I haven't tasted their chicken for a long while. How about you? Do you have any request? She said it's up to you. Are you sure? Why don't you buy her a new dress? Do you need something done? Are you open? Hold on. Our luck just keeps on coming! Don't talk about it. You might break our luck. I'll just be downstairs. I've stopped using shampoo. I just use conditioner to avoid getting dandruff. How come you don't have dandruff? What? I'd rather have dandruff than rot. Wait a second. There you go. You should always smell nice and look good all the time. No one notices me, because they said I smell like rotting flesh. Let me see. There. You look beautiful! You know what? Before you got here, I thought... maybe it would be better if I just disappeared. Rather than physically be here, but feel invisible all the time. You know what? This is the first time that father spoke to me again. He was always looking for you. I know that each night he wishes... I had gone away instead of you. This is only for one week, all right? Thank you. And can I ask you not to turn off the lights in my room? We need to save up on electricity. I'm afraid to be alone. I'll go to bed. Let's go to sleep. Excuse me. Sorry, coming through. Is it your birthday? Have you paid your fare? Not yet. That's for the both of us! Consider it my payment for the other day. And my birthday gift to you. Thank you. Too bad I had to get off before he did. I bet you had something to do with that. Is that your birthday gift to me? It sure is. Let's dig in. Here you go, father. Thanks. Here's mine. I forgot something! Hold on! Can you hear that? No! How about now? Father, do you remember this? Father, come dance with me. Come on, let's dance. Go ahead, I'm fine. I'm going to dance with her instead. Go ahead. She told me to dance with you. She said that? Yes, she did. If she said so. Let's dance with her. Oops! Let's dance. Do you know where Elmer is? I know, I know. I'm worried. I haven't seen him in a week. And I haven't had a single customer in a week. What's your problem? Don't tell me you like Elmer, too. Don't get so touchy. I was just kidding. And I really need customers. Theodor might come back anytime. I spent some of my savings on my birthday. And I bought you a new dress. Not that I'm keeping score. Fine, I'm keeping score then. Hey, are you mad at me? Fucking son of a bitch! Work, god damn it! You got here early. Early? It's almost 10pm. That's 50,000 pesos. You promised you'll give me half of what you owe me. I'll give the rest next month. There you go again with your excuses. You know what, this will be worthless next month. Your interest keeps piling up. Is this property really 430 square meters? Excuse me? It says there on your land title. You didn't know that? No, I didn't. But even if you doubled this, it wouldn't be enough to pay off your debts. Well, land value does not depreciate. They say it even goes up over a period of time. I guess that's not a bad deal for me. I'll go ahead. I don't want to fall asleep on my drive back. Sonya, if I don't have the full payment by next week. I'll take your property as payment. Hey. I don't know what your problem is with me. Help me out here. I need to get customers. I'm already neck-deep in my debts because Theodor kept raising the interest. Please give me a lot of customers. I just need to pay off my debts. Are you two having a fight? Why don't you ask her? Talk to her and sort this out. It's only the three of us here, and you two can't get along. Are you done with that? Please bring him down carefully. Are you Mrs. Sonya? Elmer told me we can count on you. We are cash-strapped right now. He told me you helped him when he got into an accident. Thank you, missus. That was a huge help. I hope you can help us again in our time of need. Have mercy on us. I don't have any money, even for his coffin. Are you all right, missus? Missus? Missus? Don't you call me missus, you fucking bitch! I asked you to give me a customer. But I didn't ask for Elmer. I didn't know that bastard had a wife. And you! I thought I could count on you! You weren't like this to me before. I thought we were on the same team. Why are you doing this to me? Sonya! Is that how you speak to your parents? Bring her to my room. I'll keep her until you two sort this out. Don't worry about Sonya. She just needs to cool her head. Let's go to sleep. Anyone here? Mother was out doing errands. I thought she was at our aunt's place. But we found out she wasn't there. - We haven't seen her in months... - She's not here. We've been looking for her everywhere. She's not here. And we haven't had any customers for a while. I've been thinking of closing down this shop. If ever you see her... We might already be closed down next month. You won't find her here. What are you looking at? I might find some money lying around. Theodor is coming back this Saturday. What did you say? You want to talk about it now? Fine! Who was that woman who came looking for you? You already want to leave me just because I raised my voice at you? You want to go with that woman? Fine, go ahead! She's gone! I drove her away! How should I know? Shut up! Cut your drama! You're not even any help! Son of a bitch. I need that money badly! If you can give me that, then you can go and leave! Everybody leaves me anyway. I always get left behind! You. Are you ready to leave me, too? What did you say? Why did you just tell me that now? Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm glad I didn't stop digging. I thought you were just pulling my leg. Thank you again. Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! What the... Sonya! Here's the money. It's complete. I counted it last night. Where's my land title? Just a sec. Who knew you could do it? What took you so long? What's this? That's your money. Are you fucking with me? Huh? - No! - Money? You call this money? That's your money! I counted it last night. - Are you out of your mind? - That's the money I owe you! Stop fucking with me! You piece of shit! This is your money. This is real money. You crazy bitch! I'm on the end of my rope with you. But you keep pushing me over the edge! Where's my goddamn money? Here it is. It's right here. You fucking bitch! You skank! Fucking whore! I'd rather fuck a dead body than have sex with you! This property is mine now. When I come back, I want you and your father out of here! Or else, I'll put this bullet right through your head! What is this? What the fuck is this? Where's the money? Where is it? Where's the money? Where's the fucking money? Where is it? What is this?! Sorry... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
