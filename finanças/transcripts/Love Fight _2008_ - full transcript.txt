Stop it! Help me! We want to hit you. Stop it now! - You need to be beat up. - Stop it! Stop hitting me! Aki, save me! Crybaby Minoru. - Stop it! - Wanna say something eh? - Minoru! - Aki! Bastards, stop it! Stop it all of you! Stop it! Minoru, why are you always with Aki? Without Aki, you are useless. Shut up! What can you do? If you are brave, then don't hide behind a girl! If you are a man, come out! If you bully Minoru, I won't let you go! Let go! All of you, let go! Aki! Oh, Aki has a bleeding nose. How disgusting! A nose bleeding bug. I dare you to say that one more time! How come this girl is like this? Cowards. If you are strong, don't run away! Why are you always being bullied? I am too weak. I am afraid of fighting with others. Don't cry. Aki, it hurts a lot! I hate crybabies the most! Love X Fight During the first day of the school ceremony, big brother fell in love with Nishimura the moment he saw her. What is wrong with this? Hurry up and ask! Introduce her to us since you're childhood friends. Why would Aki Nishimura be in a relationship with a sissy like you? I am not in a relationship with her. What is a sissy? Men that are not like men and can't do things right. If you two are not together, why are you always with her 24/7? We were neighbours since we were young. Our mothers get along as well. You can't understand even that? If she tell you to go eat noodles then you would go right away? You should consider big brother's feelings. I can introduce you to her anytime. - What did you say? - It's my request. Please go out with her. Since you put it like that... Minoru, I see you. Nishimura. How cute. Cute. Hello, I am Kuniharu Saotome. I'm in the 6th class of the first year and with Mr. Tachibana... Aki, don't. Stop. Minoru, let's go. Aki, you shouldn't do that. But they were bullying you. It's because you are always sticking to me. Why are you blaming me? You useless fellow. You're getting better. Her hair looks so smooth and soft. Isn't it a bit longer than it was during the first day of the school ceremony? What brand of hair conditioner does she use? Ogaki-san, smell it. Why? At the morning gathering, I walked by Nishimura and smelled her hair. I use the same hair conditioner. If you like, please try the smell it. Nishimura is mine. She is definitely yours, Ogaki-san. But, Ogaki-san I heard that she has a boyfriend. What? Who? From what school? Who is it? 3, 2, 3, 4... We will stop here today. Thank you. - Don't run, you bastard! - Excuse me. Are you in a relationship with Nishimura? - I am sorry. - Bugger off!! I am not! Then introduce me to her. I will introduce you to her. Please go out with her. Why aren't you stopping then? If I stop, I will get hurt for sure. I am sorry, it looks like you have nowhere to go. You idiot! Here I go! Get up. I am going to hit you. One more time. Enough. Who are you, mister? This has nothing to do with you. Plus, can you beat me in fighting? Don't waste your energy. You are too young to play fist fighting with me. Don't think that this is over. I will not give up on Nishimura. Wait. Yes. Do you want this? Thank you. Idiot! Are you hurt? [Oki's Boxing Gym] 16 years old. You are just slightly old. Your first time at a place like this? Yes. Thank you so much for just now. If I learn boxing will I become stronger? You want to become strong? How strong do you want to become? Do you want to be as strong as those people just now? World number one. I see. Looks like you are used to being bullied. Please accept me as your disciple. I am sorry. What? Okay, stop eating. I don't have to maintain my weight anymore. I am not going to box again, so why does it matter? I worked hard to get into the Boxing Championship. I won't accept this! - Alright. - How can I accept it? No matter what I want to participate in the competition. No one can stop me. I still hope the coach can participate... in the Boxing Championship. I want to see the coach become the world's champion. Thank you for always being on my side. We have worked hard till now. Coach, other than closing the gym, isn't there any other option? Every day only you come to train, how can this place be considered a training gym? Then just recruit some trainees and it will fine, right? I will go to the fitness center and recruit all the professionals and beginners. I will pass out flyers and get a job. No matter what, please don't close the gym. I beg you. Coach. I want to work beside you. You won't have a future with an old man. Find something else before it is too late. Then hand the gym over to me. You just have to be like before and box. That's right. Wasn't there a boy that wanted to learn how to box? Just make the decision and do it once more- If you don't put on the bandages tight, it will hurt a lot. - You must put them on. - Yes. Then wrap it around 3 times here. Pull up your sleeves. Yes. Once... twice. Strike, return. What kind of punches are those? I am sorry. Raise your foot. Return quicker. The basic is to punch and run. Right now you don't need to run. Yes. Go up and try it out. - Can I? - Yes. What are you doing? How do I get in? Just crawl under this. Tachibana. I am sorry. Are you okay? I am fine, I am fine. I am sorry. I wasn't paying attention just then... You only bumped into me a little. But you are bleeding... I am fine, really. Are you Okuda? - Yes. - Why are you here? Didn't you move? I went to Tokyo but I came back. Then your uniform is... Do you remember Yuko? - The one who was our class leader during junior high. - Yes. She text messaged me and told me, you are attending this high school. So I transferred to this school. What? Am I troubling you? No, no. Tachibana, do you run so much every day? Why? Did I scare you? I have just seen a Tachibana I have never seen before. I am a bit shocked. I really like this scent. Because it is the smell of a man that I have never been. May I smell it too? Ah, I'm tired. - Hello. - Oh. Who is this? - She's... - I am Kyoko. What a pretty girl. I want to learn how to box with Tachibana. What? Is it strange for a girl to want that? - Kyoko. You... - No. It's quite typical. Wait. Takae. I am really happy. Our tuition is quite cheap too. [After 4 months.] After you learn boxing, you will definitely get the figure of a supermodel. - Aki, bye bye. - Bye. Wait. Hey, don't run away Tachibana. I caught you. Why are you smiling? It's all your fault. Who is it this time? Ogaki from the 3rd class? That gorilla head? I will kick him until he becomes a pig head. Don't act so rashly. He just wants to date with you. Why do you run away? You think you can survive 3 years at high school like this, as fast runner? Hey! What are you doing? - Shut up! - Don't run! You became stronger. Are you training behind my back? No, I'm not. Ah, it's locked. Nishimura, wait for me. Listen to me. If you don't want to be broken into pieces like this brick, then find that bastard Tachibana! Hurry! - Yes. - Yes. Nishimura. What happened? Don't face me. I am not. Tachibana. Tachibana. What's happened? Kyoko. Who is Kyoko? Your classmate in middle school, Okuda Kyoko. Tachibana, how did you end up inside? No, we didn't intentionally go inside. That fellow... - Don't touch my breasts! You pervert! - I didn't touch them! Nishimura, don't hit him. - I know that you have always been bullying Tachibana. - What? Tachibana, use your boxing skills and hit Nishimura. - Kyoko, you can't tell her! - What boxing? - What? - Kyoko just said boxing. I am not learning boxing. I see. Hurry. Open this. Tachibana, Tachibana. How unexpected. You actually like this place. How beautiful. I heard from Minoru that your punches and kicks are very good. I have always thought that you were the strong and rough type. That is just one side of me. Even though no one knows, no matter how strong I may be, I have times when I want to admire flowers. I hope that you can also use that on me. What? Your arm lock. On Nishimura? I want to feel that kind of pain to understand your strength. But... Just do it please. Really? Start. Pull the arm to the back. Have your palm face down and stretched out. That way you can lock your opponent's arm and shoulder. - Okay. - Nishimura, are you hurt? Not at all. What about this arm? Put this arm around the neck. Is that so? If it hurts, you can tell me. Use a little more strength. Then excuse me. Nishimura. I... That's it. If you truly are a strong man, why would you bully a weaker person? How can I let a person like you go? Nishimura. Nishimura! If you bully Minoru again, I, Nishimura Aki will not forgive you. I made you a lunch box. What? When you were practicing, didn't you say that you were hungry? Here, for you. Wow. It is even in the shape of a boxing glove. Am I troubling you by bringing a lunch box without telling you beforehand? No. No one has ever made me a lunch box. I am very happy. - Thank you. - That's good. Chopsticks. I am going to start eating. How is it? Very good. Then I will make some for you every day. Really? 123. 123. 123. 123. 123. 123. 12... Tachibana, you are good! That... Kyoko, when did you first realized the real face of Aki? Since the first year of middle school. Because I have always been closely observing Tachibana. At first, I didn't believe that Nishimura would be the violent type. I have always thought that you and Nishimura were together. Whether it is elementary or middle school, you two were always together. Yes. But that isn't the same as liking someone. Really? I am learning boxing because I want to defeat Aki and gain my freedom. Willing to defeat a woman makes me sound useless, right? No, not at all. I am very touched. Tachibana, you only told me what your heart really wants. I think it is right for me to learn how to box. Boxing is very interesting. I also became great friends with Kyoko. 123. 123. Hello. We saw an advertisement about this place. May we look around? Please do, please do. Welcome. Please sit here. Here, look! This is the one we hit. Please move aside miss. Is this really going to help us lose our weight? Kyoko, where are the member registration papers? - I am not sure. - Wait. We are only here to look around. Little boy, we are not here to learn. I am sorry. Your hands will hurt. 12. 123. If you continue training, you will lose at least 20 pounds. Do not try this to your husband during a fight. Upper. Upper. The first day is hard. Are you ok? It's really tough. - Come every day. - Okay. Straight to your mother-in-law! - Easy, easy. - Okay. Give me punches. One more time - I am sorry. - Aim before hitting. That's right. Very good. Just like that. This side again. Thank you so much! We will stop here today. Keep this motivation. Tachibana, you have worked hard. Thank you. - Please take it over. - Okay. You have waited long. - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is the specialty of this restaurant. Even though it is the specialty it is only 370 yen. Oh! What a rare guest. Isn't it the coach of the boxing gym? - Long time no see. - The boxing gym has been reopened? Don't be scared. This punk used to be the sponsor. - Excuse me. - Yes? You'd better quit that crappy gym. Little one, you should give up now. Do you know why Japan's boxing champion did not become the world's boxing champion? Because he didn't have luck. Training without luck is useless. Stop talking. This man used to crazily support Oki. - I did not! - Leave, leave. Are you crazy? Let's eat. Minoru, I was like you. I was bullied often when I was young. I couldn't stop crying. Really? Within the boxer trainees who aim to become a world's champion, many of them were bullied often when they were young. I can't be the world champion. Crying as I hit the sandbag, I became strong. Everything depends on the fist. Depends on myself. So you are here. Coach, there is a strange girl who wants to join. What are you talking about? Eat. She said our Minoru is under your care. After she said that, she started hitting the sandbags. Minoru, how is she related to you? Aki, what are you doing? Nishimura. Coach, this is the girl. Hey! Stop it! I am Nishimura Aki. I'm in the 2nd class of the first year at Nishi high school. Please take care of me. If you keep hitting, your fist will hurt. That's okay. It's not going hit me back. Does it feel great to punch people on the ring? Aki! No need to say it, of course it will be great. Do you want to try? - Really? - Takae. Sit down. Yes. - Turn around. - What? Stretch out your hand. First this one. Hold that. That's right. Open. - Okay, try it out. - Thank you. You can hit any way you want. I will be your punching bag. May I? I am really going to do it. Nice punch. She's not bad. Go, go! Tachibana. There's aonori (green laver). I am sorry. It was my fault for telling her about your boxing lessons. It's okay. You can't kick though. If I take your kick, it would break my jaw. Thank you for the advice. How did you learn your moves? You are funny. You actually told me. But there are rules for fighting here. Okay. We will stop here today. Minoru, I have decided. I am going to learn boxing. Aki! Morning. Don't do it. Why do you have to learn at the same place I go? I can go anywhere I like. What about ballet? I am going to quit that. If you start boxing, everyone will know. Know what? If your innocent mask is taken off, everyone will know how rough you are. Do you think that is good? I was so thrilled with the mitt. It was a pleasant sensation. Pleasant sensation? Don't you think the coach is cool? A middle-aged man who looks a bit worn out like the coach is probably my type. Your motive for learning boxing is impure. [Oki's Boxing Gym] Excuse me... Are you here to watch people box? Yes. Please come in. The coach will be back soon. If you don't mind, you can use my towel. May I? Thank you. It is good here. Even though the gym is a bit shabby, but our coach is great. He used to be the champion of Japan. He knocked out in all 11 games and become the defending champion 3 times. Do you want to be as strong as the coach? May's Wing. Is it a movie? Yes. Are you the main actress? Have you ever heard of Serizawa? Serizawa? Oh, he is famous. He appeared in the drama yesterday. Is he the leading male? How cool! The storyline is similar, a man who used to be a champion, loses his daughter, and decides to counter the pain and stand once again on the ring. What a great story. Are you the protagonist's wife? I am... going to be his ex-lover. Misugi Junko? Weird. I have heard of this name before. Misugi Junko... Because the movie contains boxing scenes, I was hoping you can advise me. Because, I'd like to act like a trainee. Oh! I got it! You are that Misugi Junko! You were in a drama before. At that time Miss Misugi was still a high school student. Your role was a ballerina who could not dance after a car accident. Am I right? Coach, stop pretending it's not a big deal. Look at this. How awesome! How perfect! You're already perfect. Whatever a beauty like you does, it will look good. No, let's be more serious. - Please do it again. - Are you ready? Make a small step, then make a punch. 12. 12. Minoru. Yes? Starting from today, we will begin sparring. What? Coach is so biased. What about me? Nishimura. What? I want to fight too. Don't rush it, don't rush it. Good luck, Tachibana! Go! Please teach me. Hurry go, Minoru, go! Don't run away. Hit him. Tachibana... You are good at dodging. Steady your fist and hit him. Minoru, why are you running? Hit him! Hey, Minoru! What are you doing? Hit him. Hurry and hit him. Come over here. What are you doing? The coach isn't even blocking your attacks. Don't be polite! Hit him as hard as you can! Safety gears. Give me some safety gears. Yes. Minoru, I will wear safety gears too. Don't be polite. Aim for my face and hit me hard. Go! Sorry. I can't do it. I am sorry. Here. - What? - Come here. Airplanes will make a very low pass. Holding the rock like this and looking up there and thinking that I may can hit the airplane but being patient. I liked to play this when I was small. Stop being patient, and if you want to throw it, just do it. I can't. I can't throw it. I am such a chicken. Yesterday I was like this too. Whenever I want to throw a punch, my heart starts beating faster. In the end, I couldn't do anything. It's okay. Just let your heart beat fast. Is your heart beating fast? In your lifetime, you will encounter many events that will make your heart beat faster. Because of that, being young is meaningful. Okay, let's go. I told you to stop crying. You are useless. You started smoking? That pair of glasses suits you. I am old and my vision is bad. - Let's again... - Let's... What you want to say must be the same as what I want to say. How would you know what I want to say? Of course, I know you. It's so easy. Why didn't you come that time? I did. Lies. I am not lying. We decided on that day. I waited for you. Inside the Shinjuku store? From the convenience store across the street... Convenience store? Why didn't you wait at that store? I was in the car watching the store's door. Then at that time you were outside? Because I didn't know if you were going to come or not, I was troubled. Minoru lent me his towel. The scent of the sweat on that towel smelt like yours. What? I missed that scent. The scent of the sweat of young men are all the same. Aki! Minoru, why are you crouching there? Don't laugh. What? You probably will laugh though. I don't know what you are talking about. This is all your underwear's fault. What? When I was beat up by you when we were little, I accidentally saw your underwear clearly. Whenever I think about that, I get scared and my heart will beat faster. I can't take it anymore! What does my underwear have to do with you being useless? I am laughing so hard that my stomach hurts. I am cursed and it is all because of you. I am so pitiful. Really? If it wasn't for my underwear, would you not be so useless? That I don't know. You useless fellow! Randomly looking for excuses. What underwear? Stupid. What do you want to say? Say it. Nishimura, if Tachibana and I start to date, will you try to break us apart? Of course not. Minoru and I are not in that kind of a relationship. I am relieved with that reply. Tachibana has always been under your protection. Do you know how much pain it causes him? You must not know. But Tachibana is talented for boxing. In the future, he will be able to protect himself. Okuda, what do you like about Minoru? Nishimura. You have never fallen in love before, right? How do you know? If you had fallen in love before, then you would understand the good things about Tachibana. 12. Yes, very good. Here, 12. Coach, let me participate in the sparring training. After you improve a little. Why do you keep me away from sparring training? Don't rush it. After a while, I will accompany you. Takae's eyesight is poor. I don't want to worry about that. Those words hurt. I want to fight with the coach. No matter what I want to fight with you now. It really is a pity that Nishimura is a woman. You can't kick. I understand. Okay, go. Please take care of me. Aki, good luck! Left, left. Throw punches left and right consistently and quickly. Aki, good luck! Guard, guard. Good luck! Good luck! Stay close. Stay close. So close. How is it? How is it? Weren't you arrogant just now? Coach, coach, go, go! Pay attention to your balance! Both legs are too far apart. Defence is too weak. A lot of holes for attacks. Swings arms too much. Impatient. I couldn't even hit him once. Do you want to go for one more round? When I've trained enough to hit you, please give me another chance. Nishimura, not bad. But next time in the real training be a bit more lively. Don't let the opponent get any space. Yes. We will stop here today. [Oki's Boxing Gym] Go, go, go. Left, left. What's wrong with you? How many times have I told you? Just hit it and stay close to the opponent. Such a cute child, how can you let her go up and fight? Do you want to train her to become an idol? I will pass. I look like a bad guy, but I'm not dark-hearted, but more likely a gentleman. Listen carefully. Your opponent is a professional. I wish you will learn something from her. Okay. Guard, guard, guard. Just like that. I am sorry. Not a bad opponent, right? Are you okay? Not bad. Even though it is your first time, you are not too bad. Guard, guard. Be good at guarding. Be careful of her upper punches. Hello? Hello, Tachibana? Save me! Little Aki, do you want to give up? Kyoko. Kyoko? Kyoko? Kyoko? Are you okay? I can't take such a scary stage anymore. Boxing, in the end I can't do it. Sit for a bit. But, if I give up boxing now, I won't be able to be with Tachibana. Tachibana, will you continue? I don't know. I don't know what will happen either. Tachibana. Are you starting to hate me now? Why would I? Really? That's great. But Kyoko, why did you go to watch Aki practice? I want to make Tachibana happy. Kyoko, this... Wait. Here it comes Look, this. Whenever Nishimura strikes, she will give up her guard, open up and swing her arms. Like this, you can catch her off guard. If you give her a straight punch here, I am sure you will win. Kyoko. Aki is usually on the offensive, so she naturally will give up her guard and smash into the opponent. This can't help Tachibana at all? That's not it. Thank you. Tachibana, you will defeat Nishimura. After defeating Nishimura, I hope that I will be the only one in your eyes. Coach, I will still come to train here in the future. Sparring is more meaningful than punching a sandbag. It is. It isn't easy to become a female champion. I know. Mizuki is very strong. But, I still want to feel purged of the stress after fighting with men. Why do you want to fight with men? Coach. Thank you. Why so suddenly? Coach is very strong and very nice. Even though I can't remember how he looks like I think you are like the father that divorced my mother when I was little. But Minoru can't be. That fellow is very weak. Coach, did you know that in the beginning I wasn't this good? It was very tough for a shorty like me to beat big boys. To protect Minoru, I practiced fighting every day. I didn't want to lose just because I'm a girl and a shorty. No matter how bad I was beaten, I did not cry. Look this way. Minoru and you are like the double-stick soda ice cream. What? When I was little, there were soda ice creams with 2 sticks for handles. It was only 30 yen. It was delicious. You've done that much for protecting someone, you're just so great. You two are a good duo. You shouldn't become cold hearted like an ice cream. A real strong boxer stands on the ring to protect someone. This area has changed a lot too. Serizawa, how long has it been since you last came to Osaka? Three years. Coach, please. At the Kansai region when he talked about boxing he had to mention the rural Serizawa, that's what everyone said. We will help you. Serizawa is from our area. Mr. Seta, your previous movie was really bad. But this documentary film is definitely better, right? During the last scene, show my awesome sparring. How great is that! Thank you. Coach, this man is the worst producer. He chose the actresses and he has an unclear relationship with each one. I would not do something like that! Having two cell phones and using different ring-tones! Which song is for a woman's call? Give me a break! Please. What was that? I thought you would dodge. You suck. Come, idiot. Who is the idiot? This time, we will use two fists. - Okay. - Wait. This is expensive. Okay, go! Oki gym will get a lot of publicity. Even though it is a documentary film, it is an advertisement for Serizawa's movie. Here it says, knocked out the opponent during sparring. Yes. That means there will be a fake competition. Yes. Also, don't wear safety gears. If we don't show Serizawa's face then we can't get the message across. Excuse me. This ring tone, "Ode to Joy". It's a woman. A woman. You, lecher. Which actress is it? Hey Joe, you're retired boxer. Why do you care about a fake competition? Don't you need a lot of money right now? Don't you want to train Aki? For the boxer you train, no matter where you are at in life, you have to continue training her. You must take the responsibility. Don't you agree with that? Listen well, Joe. Our apprentices let us dream of success. Let's say, they offer us tasty sake. But we gotta drink the sake diluted with muddy waters. Oh, the lazy apprentice is coming. Minoru. Being afraid of attacking is being afraid of being hit. That is a good quality of being a great boxer. Even so, I... About your footwork and quick dodging, who could be like you? To me, you are a genius. How can I be a genius? Do you think that I am lying? 10 years of dodging made you a genius. 10 years of punching made Nishimura Aki a genius. You two are both talented people after ten years. It's okay if you don't hit today, maybe you will be able to hit tomorrow. If you work hard for ten years, you can probably become the world's champion. I become a world's champion? Didn't you say that you wanted to become the world's number one? Coach. I am sorry. I lied. To be honest, I learned boxing only to defeat Aki. I am sorry. Minoru, you really are clumsy. But I won't hate you for that. Just be yourself. Show me your fist. Do you know why boxers use this fist to hit their opponents? "I will not to pull their hair". "I will not poke a thumb in their eyes". "I will not play dirty". This is what the fist represents. My legendary trainer used to say that boxing isn't fighting nor is it a sport. It is the world's most beautiful conversation. Takae is also worried about you. Come to practice. Cut! It just doesn't feel right. Cut the stabbed scene and take a close-up picture of her. Junko, because the clothes are stained with blood, please turn around. - We didn't prepare another dress. - What? Director, that way, we won't be able to film the face. That's fine. A good actress can still portray a feeling of beauty from her back. Right, Junko. Hey! Cameraman, water. Is it really fine? It is too much. Yes, it is okay. She even picked up a job like that. She already decided to act in a film, even though I said not to do this one, she said that she had to accept it. The company isn't doing too well either. I am sorry for having you rush over personally. This is the deposit. You used to be close to Junko, right? I am a very weird man. I am very interested in the men involved with my women. I saw the pictures in an entertainment magazine. You were walking out of her apartment, and you grabbed the reporter. After that, her pure innocent reputation as an actress was ruined. I am sorry. In the entertainment world, that is like death. She lost her advertisements and main lead in dramas. You became a drunk and lost badly when you were defending your title. It was as if the two of you planned to disappear together. She also knows that this film is her last chance. Otherwise she would not crash at my hotel. Alone? Where's Takae? He's gone for his part-time job. I heard that you came to watch my filming today. Yes. I want you to come when I have dialogues. Okay. You worked hard. That role is not bad either because I really like this job. The co-workers are very nice too. Junko. Can you put a bandage by yourself now? What? The movements need to be more lively. The base of your foot needs to be raised. Rhythm, rhythm. 12. Just like that. Like this. The arm has to be tucked in. Tight. Aim for the face. That's right. Do it a few more times. Let the body remember the movement. Okay. I am back. Didn't we discuss this before? To give the secret signal, after we win the competition and come home. My face was hit. But once I said "I am back" I felt happier. Work hard on the film. Okay. My family used to be very poor back then. But no matter what, I wanted my parents to have a better life. When I was 19, I went to Osaka with a motorcycle carrying a sleeping bag. At that time I didn't know if I should become an actor. I spent all my time with fighting and part-time jobs. It was then that I learned boxing. Okay, okay! - Be more serious! - I am sorry. - If you can't work properly, go home. - Mr. Serizawa please change the bandage for the match. He's bullshitting. His family is wealthy. He grew up in a mansion. It is part of the movie. Really? Oh. Even though it is a film, you still don't want to see that person lose? As long as he gets money, he agreed to fight in a fake competition. The man you used to have a relationship with, is just that much. What are you doing? Come over and help. I have been anticipating this. Anticipating me lose? No. Because it is the first time seeing the coach fight, so I am anticipating it. Coach, please beat up that man. Are you nervous too? Don't worry. I tried his punches. How can a person like that beat the coach? Don't give me pressure. I am very old. I will be ugly-looking, don't laugh at me. Excuse me. Is it time to go on? If you are ready, then please. - Give this to us. - Oh, thank you. How cool is that! Smelling this scent makes me excited for no reason. Okay, go! Old man, please go easy on me. The random people on the boxing stage, please leave the scene. Beat him up. Good luck, coach. The game will start soon. Countdown from 5. 4321. Why, coach? Why didn't you dodge it? What happened? Minoru, the coach's boxing style is like Minoru's. He only aims to punch the gloves. Hey! What did you do to our coach? The coach would had never lost to a person like that. What did you do? You should know, right? Tell me! Why is the coach like that? Patience. It is all to keep the boxing gym open. Coach, don't fight anymore! I don't want to see the coach like that. I will do more part-time jobs for the gym. Coach, use your real strength! Let me see the real coach! Look closely. He wants you to see the him right now. Enough! Please do not stand up! Coach! Coach! What is wrong with him? Is there something wrong with his brain? Your fists shouldn't be used on a person like that. If you look down on our coach, I, Nishimura Aki won't ever forgive you. Nishimura, you did well! Great! Coach. Let's go back. Stop. I am not stopping. This is the punishment for embarrassing the coach of Oki's Boxing Gym. Minoru, save me! Minoru, what are you doing? Do you want to play? No need. No need? Are you scared? I'm not scared. To be honest, I didn't want to see the coach lose. I don't want the coach to pretend to lose. - But the coach didn't run away. - But... I am not sure if he purposely tried to lose the competition. But he didn't run away. Don't say anymore. No matter what, Minoru, I have definitely lost. Because I didn't punch the opponent, I lost at the end. I had a bloody nose and a swollen face. Did you watch closely? I did. Thank you. Nishimura, thank you. The kick you did for me. I was very happy. Coach, may I ask a question? What question? Why didn't you become the world champion? Aki, shut up. That is a very impolite question. It's okay. But you can't tell other people. Because of a woman. I am very interested in the coach's love life. I just wanted to be with her forever. If it was because of her, giving up the whole world was not a waste. I seriously thought that. I think I have fallen in love with the coach. Little girls shouldn't make such a joke on an old man. Right, Minoru? I want to kiss you. I want the same kiss you gave to the woman who made you give up everything for her. Try me. Hey, Minoru. Aki actually said something like this. Shouldn't you be caring about her? Say something. I... don't mind. Really? - Aki, wait. - Don't care about me! How can you tell me not to care about you? Aki... But just then you didn't care about me. Minoru, you just said you don't mind. Really, what is wrong with that group of people? Serizawa was beaten up badly by a high school girl. Basically humiliated Serizawa and me. We can't advertise it like this. Forget it, hurry up and come in. I am leaving. What did you say? I have prepared to return to Tokyo. Thank you for all the care you have given me. You idiot! Do you know how hard I worked to give you this role? Think carefully of who you are earning money from. Oki taught me something. I have been wrong all along. Hey. Is this Oki's blood? So that's it. Forget it. Come in then. I am leaving first. Hitting with no direction like that will cause your fists to hurt. Apologize to Aki. She is only a first year in high school. A man who makes a girl cry is the worst. I hate the coach like that. Apologize to Aki! Why? Because she cried. This is the first time I have seen her cry. You like Nishimura Aki. Why won't you admit it? Why didn't you listen to your heart? Don't pretend that you know everything! What about you? You couldn't give Junko happiness either. Go up the boxing stage. Use your fist to talk to me. Not right. The coach isn't that weak. My punches would not have been able to hit the coach. Have I ever lied to you? Minoru. The punches then were good. [Oki's Boxing Gym] Miss Misugi's already checked out today. Is that so? Thank you. Take care. Never mind. Annoying. But that's good. Is it really ok that I took over Misugi Junko's role? It looks like I still owe the company's director a favour. I already talked to them and told them not to give her any jobs. Her acting career ends here. You are scary. [Oki's Boxing Gym] This person is called Tsubasa Julia. I think that if she was to act a male role, no one would be better than her. I'm a big fan of her! Really? Don't you think she looks similar? - What? - You and her. Me? Hey... I don't look like her at all. Because you don't watch her performances you don't know. The moment she looked at me, she breathtakingly looks like you! She does stare at you. I have always dreamed of being Tubasa Julia's partner. Tachibana, can you become my Tubasa Julia? What? I have always believed that the happiest moment in people's lives are when they are 16. Wear this, then kiss me. Wait... wait a moment. You don't want to wear it? Then I will take my clothes off. - Kyoko... - This is my gift for you. Kyoko, you can't do that. Let's hurry and sing the birthday song, blow the candle, then turn on the lights. Look. This is a corset. I'm like Scarlett O'Hara, aren't I? I completely don't understand what you said. Every time I see you untie your shoelaces on the ring, I was thinking of the day you can untie the strings of my corset. Kyoko... Calm down, Kyoko, and let's sit and talk. You hate me? No, but... Look, between Aki and I, we haven't found out who is the winner. Do you really think you can win? To be honest, you don't. You don't even dare to punch. How are you going to win? You really do like Nishimura. Are you going to keep her protecting you? Tachibana, you are a big liar! I am sorry. Despicable. My sixteenth birthday is ruined! You are such an idiot. You gave all the money back to them, didn't you? I was yelled at by the director. He will shoot the movie again with another boxer. You just let him hit you. You really are an idiot. You are too. If the boxing gym's billboard is broken, let it be. My drawing isn't that ugly. My drawing is far more better than that. The first time I saw you on television, you were glowing. When I was drawing, I was thinking of the picture you drew. That was the best I could do. I have to thank you for a lot of things. Because of this injury, I can't do the role in the movie, but I received a role in a drama starting next month. So I have to work hard to recover. I see. You should take care too. Okay. That's not right. This is your fist. On that rainy day, I went to watch your last match. I was in the stadium, even though I was stopped by the management company. I wore a big mask and sunglasses. Joe Oki is still a boxer. I am so glad. Looks like the medicine is working now. I feel like I can go to sleep now. To be able to meet you, I feel fortunate. I am back. Welcome back. Why are you here and not practicing? No matter how much you hit the moles, they will not hit you back. If you really think that I am bothersome... then I can disappear from your sight at any time. I always thought of it as a happy thing to be able to protect the coward, Minoru. I always thought of it as a happy thing, but... But when I was kissing the coach, it was the first time I thought of being protected by you. I hoped that you would protect me. That was the first time I cried in front of you. The tears that I clearly hated. I am a loser. So what if you saw my underwear? It doesn't even matter if my underwear is seen or not. Aki, stop being like this. Then fight with me. Stop dodging and punch me down, then tell me that you no longer need Nishimura Aki's protection. Stop taking pictures of Aki! This is not a show! Come here, come with me. Aki... Aki. Hey. Are you okay? Didn't you defeat me? Your punches are great. You have defeated me. Now no one can beat Minoru. You... also don't need... my protection again. Do you like the coach? - Why are you asking that now? - Just answer me. I don't know. You don't know but you asked him to kiss you?! Hurts... What is this? Don't think too much of it. It's an antidote. It tastes like blood. Usually people don't spit at a time like this. My brain went blank... after I was hit down by you Me too. I want to continue boxing. Then I will become the world champion and always protect you. I don't understand Minoru anymore. Me neither.
