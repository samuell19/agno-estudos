(rhythmic drumming) (gentle acoustic guitar music) - [Wil] My name is Wil Hunter. This is my twin brother Orrie. Having a twin can be, well, a pain in the ass. But it's also great knowing someone always has your back. Orrie's into making movies. Me? I like to paint and draw. - (mumbles) died. - [Simon] Get the boys in it. - Yay, they did it! - [Wil] After college, my dad wanted me to move home and help run the family storage business. - Your future's in storage. - [Wil] So he could realize his dream to build a plane and fly like the Wright Brothers. But I wanted to make it as a painter. So with the urging of my girlfriend, I went for it. She and I moved to New York City. And I tried to make it as a gallery artist. - Thank you for showing me your work. It's just not for me. - [Wil] That didn't work out. (snickering) So now I'm just taking life one day at a time. Yeah, that's not a problem. All right, thanks so much, have a good day. Hey Weezy, I don't think we have any mulch left, can you check the back shed? Susan? Hey, what are you doing here? - Hi. I thought you went to Charleston. - Yeah, that fell through, so I'm back here working for dad. - Give me a hug, it's good to see you. Right, sorry. I need to get into my mom's unit, but she can't find her key. - So how's everything with Lucian? - Oh it didn't work out. Anyway, my mom asked me to come help with her arches. She's been kinda sick. The gallery scene is really slow in New York in the summer anyway. - Sorry to hear she's not doing well. I forgot she ran those things. - Yeah, yeah, it's fine. She's gonna be fine, I think she just needs some time to take it easy. (shrieks and laughs) - Got it. All right. Here you go. Need a hand? - Yeah.

Hi, sorry, they told me that you would be in here. - Yeah, hi. - Oh. Whoa, that's beautiful. Wow. Yeah, your colors and the lines are really bold. It's good. You should do this art show this weekend. - No-- - It's gonna be a great opportunity. It's a chance for us to reconnect and... I don't know, I missed you. - I don't think so, Susan. - Look, I have to say this. I'm sorry for how things went down in New York. - Wow. You're back. That gallery owner cheat on you with the younger, blonder model? That what happened? - Just think about it. - Sure. - Couldn't have been blonder though, that hair is like pfft. What's Jabba the Slut doing here? - She wants me to show my art at some art show this weekend. I don't know. - You should do it. Did I miss the part where you told dad we were doing this? - I was going to, and then just didn't find the time. - Hey! Good God, you boys scared the shit out of me. - Yeah, the feeling's mutual. - What are you all doing out here? I thought someone was trying to steal the van. - Okay, Weezy, just do us a solid and please don't tell dad that we're borrowing the van. We'll have it back before he even notices. - I'll lie to my girlfriend, but not the king. Look, no promises, just get it back here as quick as you can. I'm going back to bed. - Goodnight, Weezy!

Goldfish? - Be nice, all right? These are my colleagues. - This is your competition, Wil. They need to be vanquished. - Yeah, I'm not vanquishing anybody. - All right, let's get some soundbites. How do you feel? - Good. Good. - Wil, don't do this, don't do the oyster thing all right, I need you to open up. Let's hear some bold statements. - Bold statements. - [Orrie] You know I can edit this to make you look like an asshole. - Okay, okay, calm down. Dude, I'm nervous, all right? I don't know how people are gonna like my paintings. What if they don't like them? What if I don't sell enough paintings? What if I get there and... - [Orrie] She looks pissed. - [Wil] Shit. - You're late! - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. - You were supposed to be here an hour ago. - Sorry, we got, we-- - [Orrie] There was an accident on 64th. A bad one. - Yeah, accidents and you, what a surprise. Okay, do you have your booth fee? - Can I write you a check tomorrow? - Fine. Oh my God, tell me you have a tent. - Why? It's a beautiful day. - With a 30% chance of rain. (text ding) Oh shit, 40. Orrie, you can't film here. - That's just hurting Wil. 'Cause this is his documentary. A conflicted artist trying to fulfill his potential. Plus, Susan, this actually helps you. You see, no one has done a behind the scenes documentary of an art show before. - No! - Do I need to remind you that I'm an award winning filmmaker? - Oh really? What happened to the horror surf movie you were making? - Cowabunga Corpse? I will admit that surfing in zombie costumes was harder than I had anticipated, but it was a good script. - Okay look, if he doesn't film he's just gonna get in more trouble. - Fine, okay. Do not disturb the artists or the customers. Do you copy? - Yes. - Great, okay, I have a billion things to take care of before this thing starts. Can you unload and set up and get this out of here? - I think we need to set up, so come on. (soft rock music) - [Orrie] Nice. Who packed this? - Rachel, check this out. - Rookies.

So what happens when you win? - They have to buy the first round of drinks that night. - Wait, so the winner of all this has to buy the first rounds? - Yeah, it's ironic. - Artists hook up. - Been there done that, trust me, it is not a pretty sight. - Depends on who's filming it. - Not even. - Bow chica wah wah! - Does he always do that?

My real job is running a self-storage facility. - Oh. - Actually I find it really inspiring. - Really? - Sure. You've got all these people that are storing their stuff, so you have the physical stuff, but you also have the dreams and fears and disappointments. All of it just goes inside a small unit that kinda feels like a canvas to me. - [Male Customer] How much? - For this one 400. - [Male Customer] We'll take it. - Really? I mean great.

I've been getting a ton of great feedback about you and your art. - My art? - It's good. - Sir, I promise, we have rodent traps, we have an exterminator that comes once a month. We will take all of your items and put them in a unit on the other side of the facility where they'll be safe. Again, I'm very sorry, we'll get this taken care of.

Like this. - This guy's the real deal huh? - Take a picture, It'll last longer! It's a figure of speech, dumbass! Now move, move, get out of the way, you're blocking paying customers. - Great art from a terrible human. - Dude, did you see all the red dots in there? I'm starting to have second thoughts about this entire thing. - Hey man, look, I'm struggling too, all right? I have all this great footage and I have no hook. I have nothing to tie all of it together. It's all so random. And have you seen these artists? There's a guy in a tent over there who just sits there and paints his navel. - He paints his actual navel, or pictures of his navel? - It's pictures of. - Still weird. - Yeah. And apparently profitable. - First show is always the hardest. Don't worry, you're gonna be a pro by the next one. - Yeah, I'm not so sure there's gonna be a next one. - Well then you have to come to the after party tonight.

Are you psychic? - Yes, would you like to know your future? - I'm good. - No, I think he's arguing with your brother. - Yeah, that would be him. Would you excuse me? - Yeah. - Hey, dad, what are you doing here? - Did you ignore Weezy yesterday? We had an irate customer. Am I doing your job now? - It completely slipped my mind, I just got caught up here, I'm sorry. - I thought we had this locked down. I'm retiring soon.

Look, every day we come here and we see the same thing. Okay? You got the browsers, the bargain hunters, the dog walkers. But every so often you get that buyer who really needs you. Who needs that piece of you to take home and hang it on their wall. It could be a million dollar mansion, or just some dump. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because those moments, they don't come around all the time. But when they do... It's like a high. It's like, what do they call it Zoey? Chasing the dragon? - You should know, Vic. - That's right, I do know. I do know, it's chasing the dragon, guys!

Where'd you get your necklace? - I actually got this from an artist at a New York show. I just thought it was so beautiful that she collected these lost objects and found places for them to belong. (phone text dings) - [Wil] Sorry. - [Rachel] What's going on? - Nothing, my brother's already here to pick me up I guess. - Oh, okay. - Goodnight. - Yeah yeah yeah, have a good night. - Hey hey hey, buddy. Tell your brother to lay off that Jackass crap. - You got it. - Later. I'll be back! Hey rookie. Think this is yours. - Thanks. You know, I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. - And you wonder why I call you rookie. - Come on, it's all new to me. - Yeah. Don't let my bad attitude rub off on you. - I mean we're artists. Isn't that what we're supposed to do? Show the world through our eyes? Can we go somewhere else? - Yeah, let's go to my tent. I can make us a showstopper. (gentle acoustic guitar music) - One showstopper, as promised. - Wow. - Right? My first show. - [Wil] Is that your mom with you? - No, that's my aunt Judy. Everyone around the shows called her Moon. She was an amazing painter. I started as her helper, going around shows while my parents were getting divorced. It was kinda messy. I don't know. Somehow Moon actually taught me how to take all these confused, angry feelings and turn it into something beautiful. She always said that art helps you face the parts of yourself that you're trying to hide from. Losing her was the hardest thing. So first sale? How did it feel? - I don't know, it felt kinda... Kinda raw. Vulnerable. Seriously, you feel something when you sell, right? - No, I don't. I guess I feel somewhere between relief and, well I think more about where the money from the sale is going, like supplies, gas for my van. - Wow, you're just hardcore aren't you? - I would love to feel what you did, really. Maybe I've just been doing it for too long. Or maybe there's just nothing left of me inside of my work. Oh my God, that sounds really sad. - Yeah. - It's just automatic now, I put on the music, get out the supplies and make art. - Okay. Well then what kind of music do you listen to? - I don't know, just music. - What do you mean just music?

Can't resist the forces of nature. - Okay. You looked so lost just sitting here, I was going to offer to take you to lost and found. - Yeah, it's a hot day. Just kinda spacing out. - Bingo? - Kid drops ice cream cone. - Congrats, you get to buy the first round tonight. Chief's RV at 7 PM. You might wanna leave your brother and his film crew behind, I don't think that would fly. - Got it. - Okay then. See you tonight? - Yeah, I'll see you tonight. Hey. Have you seen Orrie? - Yeah, he's out grabbing B-roll. - Got it. - You know, it kills me to say this, but you got talent. - Hey thanks, man. - Hey, I got a surprise for you. Come with me to my booth. - Okay. What'd you say this flavor was? - Colorado. - Should I have the whole thing? - Oh it's a creeper man, I mean you can go for it, but it might come on you quick. Look at her. - What? - I mean why is she even here if she's not gonna pay attention? Oh there it is. See? Yes, you're having an emotion. Try doing it more often. Put your frickin' cell phone down, you might get used to it. Hey. That's why we're here. (laughs) That and the brownies. - They're good. (snickering) I've been thinking about trying my luck in New York again. - I've been down that road, man. - Oh yeah, when? - Late 90s. I ran around with a bunch of sycophants and Wall Street money types. Anybody ever tells you they stopped doing coke after the 80s, that's a myth. (laughter) - So what happened? - I crashed and burned, man. Yup, that's me. I'm that art show bad boy cliche. I blame myself, really. I didn't have the right support system. Didn't have the right people keeping me in line. So now I stay away from the city, take care of myself, take care of my art. - Your art's great, man. - Hey, thank you. You know what else is great? Rachel. - Rachel. - Yeah, she just doesn't give a shit about anyone or anything and I guess that's just what makes her so... - Great? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. You looked stressed. - Oh no, the cotton candy guy had a meltdown. Literally and figuratively. - Sorry to hear that. - Look, I have some news about Merkovich. - Really? What's up? - Well he wants to include you in a group show this fall. I mean he has some ideas you're gonna need to embrace, but you should come by my hotel later and we can talk about it. - Later later? 'Cause I promised Orrie and the crew I'd get dinner. - Come after. - Okay, I'll try. - Well don't try. Wil, this is important. - Okay. (synthpop music) - [Orrie] You come around this, right on Wil's shoulder all right? - Guys, stop following me. - He's gonna swoop around-- - Orrie, not tonight! - Come on man, this is gonna be such a good moment. - Look, I need to figure out this Rachel thing okay? - Well come on, I'm not gonna bother anybody. - Can you just give me some space? - Okay. Okay. Shut it down Lance, come on. Come on, Lance. - All hail Wil! Today's Bingo winner! (cheering) - Thank you guys, thank you all very very much. Oh, and of course a very special thanks to the little boy who dropped his ice cream cone. (cheering) Long time no see. - Your enthusiasm is very cute. - Cute, really? - No no no, it's good for us road dogs to be reminded of it once in a while. - What's a road dog? - It's what we call old timers around here. - Well you're not that old. - I am in dog years, yeah. I'm really happy you're doing the boardwalk show. - Me too. - "Your work is like a ray of sunshine." - You know, believe it or not, Susan said that he wants to show some of my paintings at his show in New York. But apparently I would have to embrace some notes. - Well I think you need to ask yourself do you wanna be successful, or do you wanna be happy? - I've been inspired by your whole attitude towards your art and your music. It's all just so honest. - I've written a couple of new songs. - Oh yeah? Can I hear them? - Not here. - Okay. - But I could be talked into giving you a private concert. - I think that's good, I'd actually like that very much. - Okay. So here's the plan. I'm gonna get up, call it a night, and then you're gonna wait a couple minutes, and then you're gonna get up and you're gonna call it a night and meet me at my booth. - Pretty sneaky. - It's just these guys are like a bunch of old ladies when it comes to gossip. Besides, Chief's like my dad. - I get it. - All right. - All right. - Okay losers, you're boring me. I'm outta here. - What? Oh come on! You're leaving already? It's not even late! - Get real. - Rach, come on! (gentle acoustic guitar music) - Hey, don't stop playing. - That's just something I've been working on. - I liked it, it's pretty. - Thank you. But I will play you another song that I wrote recently. I've never played it before for anyone, this is the first time. - Well I'm honored. - Might be the last. - [Wil] Come on. ♪ I'll be waiting by the fire just to see what you inspire ♪ When we've got the time ♪ We'll plant rows of corn and lettuce ♪ And the drought will never get us ♪ When we make the time ♪ We'll be energy efficient ♪ We will hand wash all the dishes ♪ And turn all the lights off at bedtime ♪ We'll make a perfect pair ♪ When we've got the time ♪ And we've both gotta see new towns ♪ It isn't time to settle down ♪ But someday I might call you mine ♪ You'll be my man ♪ When we got the time - I loved it. - That's all I got. - That was really good. - Let's go for a walk.

It's short for Wilbur. Does that help you figure out what Orrie's short for? - Orrie, as in Orville? Oh my God, like the Wright Brothers? - My dad's love of aviation clearly trumped not embarrassing the shit out of his kids. - I mean it's kinda cute. Maybe even a little sexy. - Well then you can call me Wilbur as must as you'd like. - Wanna go swimming? - Isn't this exactly like the first scene in Jaws? - Come on. (gentle ukulele tuning) ♪ Where did you go ♪ I just don't know - Whatever, man.

I mean how would you like it if every day you came to work and your boss negotiated your salary with you, huh? - Look, I didn't mean anything by it, I just-- - Well that's the price, it's right there. - Well it's definitely worth it. - Damn right it is. - Do you take checks? - Yes. I need your address and your phone number. And make it out to me. - All right. - It's on the card. - All right. - Tax brings it to 5,300. - Tax huh? Okay. 5,300, all right. I don't know, maybe I need to think this over. I'll be back. - Hey, hey! Hey what's this man? Huh? - Hey, look buddy. - What's this, huh? Who put you up to this, huh? - Deal with him. - What's going on here? You little prick. I oughta shove that thing right up your ass. You think this is funny? - Careful what you say on camera, Vic. - Hey, whoa whoa whoa, guys, hey, what's up? - Your brother sent an actor in to jerk me around so he could film it! - Actually it's not film, it's a capture card. - You know, I don't give a shit what it is, man. You have got no right messing with another man's livelihood! - What are you doing? - I didn't do anything Wil, I'm just trying to get a good shot. - No Orrie, that's over the line. Come on. - I'll show you over the line. - Hey, dude! - You are done! You have got to go! - Me? I was just assaulted. - I don't care! Orrie, nobody wants you here. - Yeah, good riddance, man. - Vic, you're out too. - What for? - Are you kidding? I don't even know where to start with you, you are rude to customers and judges. You're drunk and disorderly. This is not your show, Vic. This is everyone's show. Leave! Go! - What do we do? - We? No, there is no we. Why don't you just clear out of here. I mean how did she even get packed up that quickly? - Show ended, she was gone. - I don't even know why she's upset. - Apparently Orrie's crew was watching a video of you two on the beach last night. - God's sake, why? Why would he even possibly think that's a good idea? I mean even for him. No wonder she... Do you have any idea where she went? - I have no idea. - Okay, thanks Chief. (gentle acoustic guitar music) It's Wil, please leave a message. (answering machine beeps) - [Susan] Hey Wil, it's Susan. It's been a few weeks since the boardwalk and I'm gonna be heading back to New York after the show this weekend. I really hate the way that we left things. If you wanna clear the air, I'd really like that. Anyway, ball's in your court. Let me know. - Well I'll be damned. - Man, I'm not here okay? - Hey, keep your pants on, I'm not here either. - Look, Vic, I'm sorry about how everything went down. - Aw shut up. Come on, I was on my way out already. As if you couldn't tell. Still painting? - Not really. Kinda lost the thrill of it. How about you? - Just got my 30 day chip. - Hey, all right. - I'm living clean again, I'm on a green tea diet. - [Wil] Green tea huh? That work? - Yeah, I'm doing whatever they tell me. I gotta make it work this time. Hey, I got a meeting in 10 minutes. You wanna walk? - Sure. - You know what? You are so close to something, you just can't even see it. You should take a page out of your brother's book, he knows how to take chances. Oh, you guys still aren't talking huh? I had a brother who was a lot like Orrie. He was a real piece of work, he loved to stir the pot. But deep down he was a really good guy. Maybe that's why I let Orrie get my goat. Old dynamics at play. Anyway, he passed away before I had a chance to make amends. Do yourself a favor and get right with Orrie. - Yeah, kinda takes two to do that. - Yeah, I know it does. And I know that he's an ass. But you know what, Wilbur? You two need each other. I mean if you read anything about the Wright Brothers you know that neither one of them would've flown without the other. - Yeah, well we're kinda grounded right now. - You get things right with Orrie, you'd be surprised how many things fall into place for you.

Anyway, it's my last week here, so I'm gonna be very happy to get back to my real life. - No, look, seriously, I didn't answer because I didn't know what to say, but I think I've got it now. You're smart. And really talented, and I know you're gonna do big things in New York. It's just taken me a long time to realize that that's not the life I want. - Look, I get it. But for what it's worth I think you would've done really well. ♪ I'm brave with the moon on my side - Later. ♪ I forget what the point of my point was ♪ Other than to say I have nothing to hide - [Pregnant Woman] Damn it. - Hey, you guys want a hand? - That would be great. - Thank you. - Let me get that for you. Ready? All right. - The move has been pretty hard on her. - You know, whatever problem you guys have, they're probably temporary. Hey, actually, do you guys mind if I take a photo? I'm an artist and you've just given me an idea. - Sure. - Yeah. - [Wil] Thanks. Have a good day, guys. - [Pregnant Woman] Thanks for your help. - [Wil] Hey, no problem. - Hey. What are you doing here? - Don't even bother getting up dude, I'm just gonna get some things. - Wil, I have something to say. - [Wil] Orrie. - No, seriously. I wanna offer you something. - What? - I'm gonna give you a free shot. Don't hold back. - You want me to hit you? - Yeah. I deserve this. Didn't think you'd actually do it. - Why, you said you deserved it. - I did. - I know. - So we cool? - We'll get there man, we always do. - So I was looking through some of the footage. I came across that little piece where Rachel's explaining her artistic motivation. Really struck me. Think I'm gonna explore more of that. - Good, man. You know, I think that that really is the heart of the shows. - It's so beautiful, let's take a picture. - Okay. - That's cute, I love it. - It is. - I'm gonna post that one. - Look at you, mom. - I know, I'm so high tech. (laughs) - [Rachel] I love it. (gentle acoustic guitar music) (phone dings) - Yes. - That looks really nice. - No way dude, what are you doing here? - Just a second, I'm not filming this by the way, I have no camera, see? - How did you even find me? - New lows in internet stalking. - I don't post anything on the internet. - No, but your mom does. Hi, Mrs. Dante. - Hi. - I'm Orrie Hunter, I'm Wil's brother. - What happened to your eye? - Oh I got punched. My brother punched me, I deserved it. - Yeah, I'm sure you did. - Look Rachel, I'm here to apologize. Please don't blame Will for this, this is all my fault. I'm an ass, plain and simple. But Wil's not. And he really cares about you. A lot more than I've seen him care about anybody. Rachel, Wil is the most thoughtful, kindhearted person that I know and he is so sad right now and... And it's all my fault. So if you could do me a favor. Just talk to him. That's all I want. Please. - Oh my God. - [Orrie] I'll drive if you guys have had too much-- - I can't deal with this right now, Orrie. Can you just get out of here? - [Orrie] Yeah, yeah. It's lovely to meet you. - Sorry. - [Orrie] Just think about it. - [Rachel] I really don't wanna talk about it. - [Wil] Hey. - Dude. Wil, these are amazing. - [Wil] Thanks. - This is your best work. Rachel would love that. - Yeah, I've tried to reach out to her a few times, but I don't think she wants to have anything to do with me. - I'm sorry, man. Wish there was something I could do. - What are you doing here? - I don't know. But I'm here. You painted me? - You like it? - Yeah. (soft rock music) (plane engine revs) - He's flying. - Oh my God. - What is this? - I finished it. - You finished the documentary? - Yeah. I think you'll like it. - Hi! Hi. - [Wil] Chief. - Hello. - I need a mama drink, everyone needs a drink, everybody's coming to drink. - Wow mom, you got a big shot, let's go. - Oh my God, okay. - You ready? - To my son. (cheering) - Mama bear like a champ! No chaser! You got it, mom. - [Rebecca] Thank you, that was special. - One of my favorite paintings. - I know, right? - It's amazing. - Thanks. - And your booth, oh my gosh, it's just so great. - [Wil] You're next, you want one? ♪ You are the ones that can go on forever - Oh my gosh.
