And unique When the rays of the morning sun brightened the world And the buds blossomed The bird danced and chirped, "Wake up, darling." "The whole world has awakened" Beautiful and unique Who is the most beautiful of them all? My darling daughter The heart pleaser. One of a kind. Loveable When the daughter smiles in her mother's lap And shows her nuances She would just win your heart Her pretty face is so endearing Pretty. And unique Oh, mother. Oh my! Our family is now blessed with the third generation too. Daughter-in-law, daughter and her daughter. - Whose daughter is she? - Mine. - And you? - My father's. And mother's, too. She's shivering outside in the cold. She barely has any clothes on. Why don't you explain to your daughter, Champa? She's already lost two kids like this. It's not her fault. If her husband was a nice man... But Champa didn't choose her husband. You chose a drunkard worthless man for her. Ma'am, I had no idea he'd turn out like that. Anyway, take the flower. If you don't accept, your uncle's heart will be broken. First promise you'll get woollen clothes for your daughter. Okay. Okay. I promise I'll get woollens. Accept it at least now, dear. Yes. Now I'll accept it. God bless. I can't help it, dear. My family is so big. There is my daughter, son. Their sons and daughters. Tell me. How many mouths do I feed? You'll have to feed everyone since they're your family. May I ask you something? Please ask your father to give me a raise. Not much. - I expect just Rs.150 per month. - That's it? - Yes, ma'am, - Fine. Oh. I am really late for college. Our daughter is a Goddess. She dotes on the kids. May God bless her! Our Nirmala will be an ideal mother. Only if her fiance Loknath also turns out to be an ideal father. I can't say if he does for his own children. He's a tyrant for others' children. I went to see his mother a day before she died. I had just stepped into the house... and the moans and groans of the children just tore my heart out. What I saw was that Loknath... I didn't tell this to Nirmala... or she wouldn't have liked even talking to Loknath. But she must know what kind of a man her future husband is. Didn't you hear? She was telling the gardener just now that... he was responsible for choosing such a bad husband for his daughter. Nirmala won't be happy with Loknath. Can't help it. Loknath's mother kept telling me just this till her last breath. That do fulfill the promise of Loknath... and Nirmala's marriage made when they were young. We must think of Nirmala's happiness first. It's important for Nirmala to get a match worthy of her. Hello, Loknath. Aren't you ready yet? Aren't you coming to hunt today? No. That wounded deer escaped us yesterday. We must find it. Brajnath, today I'll not chase a deer, but my sweetheart. - Why? Has she also run away? - Look. Is it in the newspaper too? Wow! Nirmala tops the university. You must be really happy. - Yes. Very happy. - Why? Why would you be happy? Your wife is a B.A. graduate, and the husband is F.A. fail. It's not that. Actually, I don't want Nirmala to pursue her M.A. Because in that scenario, the marriage... will be postponed another two years. I see. That's why you're off in pursuit of a female deer. Mother, you go and rest. I'll make the arrangements for the party. The girls will be here any minute. Nirmala, your letter. - Who's it from? - Loknath. I see. He's coming. Yes. He's coming to congratulate her personally. Congratulations! He'll only harass her when he comes. Congratulations! Congratulations! - You've passed with flying colors. - Tops in the university. You've saved the girls from being disgraced. You beat all the boys to the post. - A boy, too, has stood first. - Who? Read the newspaper. Did you notice? He jumped to the boys' defense so quickly. That's why he's jealous of even his daughter's achievement. It's not that. That's exactly what it is. You might well not admit it. Okay. Okay. Now let the girls enjoy. So who is this? Mr. Ramdas? - How should I know? - Who else would know? Is he with you all the time or with us? She just doesn't know him. Poor thing. - Is he from your college? - No. He must be from some other college. - Congratulations. Congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations. Ladies and Gentlemen. Look before you speak. There's no lady here. Yes, and no gentlemen, either. Okay. That's why, my useful and useless friends. I mean, achievers and non-achievers. Great. Great. Since the responsibility of congratulating our friend Ramdas... has been put on my weak shoulders, that's why... Wait! It wasn't put on you. You volunteered. Because old habits die hard. Why are you over the moon, Ramdas? You're a guest at this celebration. That's why you can speak your mind at the end. Let me speak first. - Listen. - Okay. Okay. Sit, Ramdas. Sit. Sit. Yes. So what was I saying? Well, your last word was 'listen'. Wow. Thanks for the help. You've gone crazy for sure. So, I was trying to say that this is a matter of great shame. A matter of great pride. I mean a matter of great pride. Ramdas, you've made me forget everything by interrupting me. You'll not get any congratulations now. Who the heck wants it? Is this an achievement, equaling a girl? Who the heck is congratulating you on your achievement? Listen. Since Ramdas didn't let a girl beat the boys in the exams... he deserves a reward. And this gathering's decision is that only... Ramdas be considered worthy of that girl among all men. Right. Right. And this gathering's order is that just as... these two were together in the exams... they will be together for life, too. Absolutely. Correct. Great. I haven't seen her. Who is she? Where's she from? How is she? I don't accept this order. You'll have to accept. You'll have to accept it You might or might not know. You will have to know You'll have to accept her as your life partner. Wow! What if she is dark and ugly? What if she is blind, a bumpkin and really bad? Even then. Even then, you'll have to accept this You'll have to accept her as your life partner. Take us to Ms. Nirmala's house. Why? You changed your mind? - You got scared of the police? - No. I thought you'd be disgraced. And your image will remain clean. Nirmala, I'm ashamed of my mistake. I didn't know the matter would become so serious. It's good that you handled the situation. Otherwise, I would have been slandered. Forgive me, Nirmala. I can't face anyone in your house. Let it be. As you sow, so you shall reap. I won't mention it to anyone. But you'll have to face the outcome. No. The driver returned just now with an empty car. He says the college was closed and Nirmala was nowhere to be seen. Really? I'll be right there, aunt. Nirmala. You have come, dear. What happened, Nirmala? Where did you go? The driver went to the college to pick you up. But... I didn't go to the college today, mother. I went out with Mr. Loknath. - With Mr. Loknath? - Yes, mother. Didn't you see? So cleverly she changed the table in an instant. That's why I say that nobody does it for someone needlessly. Especially women. She was upset with you. You were taking her against her wish. Still, she took your side. I can say with certainty that she loves you. I wish it were true. It means Nirmala likes Loknath. Exactly. She skipped college to go out with him. Now I understand. Do you remember? Loknath said that when he mentioned marriage... Nirmala said, 'Ask my parents'. Nirmala is a shy girl. And she believes in old customs and traditions. One thing is good. We'll be able to fulfill the promise. Yes. Now, Nirmala has become mature. I wanted her to get married this year. Good. I'll ask the priest to fix an auspicious marriage date. Ramnath. Ramnath. Stop. Stop. Why didn't you come to college? You all the spoiled the fun. Where did you go? Don't ask anything. Today I was made a laughingstock. Nothing new there. - It happens every day. - What happened today? It's a long story. I'll tell you at home. Come. Instead of thanking him, I rebuked him. And I mocked him in front of everyone. - When I think about it... - I feel bad. It's natural. Let it be. Who was that gentleman? I don't know. Seems to be college boys. He was gentlemanly. He was brave. Handsome. It seems to be a serious matter. Tell me the whole story. Don't tell anyone. I promised Mr. Loknath. I will protect your promise. Don't worry. I don't know who she was or from where she had come. But she was someone. - Was she beautiful? - Yes. Do whatever you want. Don't feel bad. We thought you had eloped with Nirmala. Who is Nirmala? The girl who scored the same rank as you in BA. She has taken admission in our college. - Is that so? - Yes. We didn't tell you so you'd be surprised... when you met her unexpectedly. And you created a new scene. You got into trouble. You were mocked. And you don't know who that girl was. If I knew his whereabouts, I would have gone right away... to apologize to him. And to thank him. Why not? But his image has been imprinted in your mind. Give his description to the police. Why did you laugh? I feel like laughing at the mention of the police. When they mentioned the police... Loknath's reaction was worth seeing. Really? He got really scared. I stopped him. Hats off to you. A girl fooled four young boys. Loknath must be really grateful to you. Is it from the girl? - Who... - Made you crazy and disappeared. Maybe she felt pity for you. Felt pity or had a change of heart. Quiet. It's from mother. She's returning tonight. Let me see. What is it? What is it? His mother has chosen a beautiful girl for him in Benaras. What's this about? Will you marry or not? His mother has chosen a girl for him. And we've decided on Nirmala. You had a tryst with that girl. Tell me. How to solve this? - Don't worry. It'll be solved tomorrow. - How? When he confronts Nirmala, everybody will be stunned. Yes. I've heard she's as beautiful as she is virtuous. It's the same girl. Who? Yesterday I hwent to release her. Really? Has she come to complain about me? This is Nirmala. You have read and heard a lot about her. You'll be pleased to learn that... she'll be studying in our college. Let me introduce you to Ramdas. You haven't met him, have you? Ramdas, come here. Ramdas. Nirmala. Both of you achieved the same score in this exam. Let's see who comes first in the next exam. Please say a few words. Please say a few words. Speech, speech, speech. I would like to say something. As Nirmala and Ramdas didn't accept our request... if you permit, I would like to say a few words. Go ahead. But speak well. And not incoherently. Yes. And keep it short. Okay. As Nirmala and Ramdas scored equally in the exams... it is but natural for them to sit on the same bench. Nirmala will decide. Okay. Today I will discuss... how history relates to our lives. And... Nirmala is our only child. You know. We got her engaged to Loknath in childhood. Later we worried whether she would like... Loknath after she grew up. God has alleviated our worry. Please fix such an auspicious marriage date that Nirmala... enjoys eternal marital bliss and her husband's love. Look, dear. I have chosen this date. Savitri and Satyavan got married on the same day. You know their story. Even death couldn't separate them. The girl who gets married on this date... her husband will always love her. Have you fixed the marriage date? Yes. Look. Not many days are left. We'll have to make the arrangements very quickly. You have come, Loknath? Today we had to fix the marriage date. That's why I called you. Sit. The priest has found an auspicious date. It's not far. Isn't this what you wanted? Yes. If Nirmala had also come, I'd have blessed them both. I have to go elsewhere. She should have come by now. Where is she? Pramila asked her to come to her house for tea after classes. She must have gone there. - The same man whom you fooled? - Yes. - It must have been embarrassing. - I couldn't look into his eyes. Eyes don't meet after hearts have united. Get lost. Today I'll study him closely. And describe his features to you. Bear it in mind and worship him every day. Tell me. Who will worship him? You or me? I don't know who. I don't know who. Look into my eyes. Get lost. I'll be late. You come, too. Stay at my house for the night. We'll talk some more. - Tell me. Will you come? - Let's go. Hello. Who? Hello. Hello. Did you hear the bell? I didn't hear it. I rang it. For the servant. Why? Nothing. Tea from the hotel... Forgive me. I forgot. Sir. What? Nothing. Go. Since when did you become forgetful? Why? When you saw Nirmala for the first time... you forgot everything and ran after her. Today, when she came, you become so forgetful... that you forgot to tell her. Everybody spoke to her, but you said nothing. What could I have said? The same thing you're thinking right now. Tell me. Am I right? What do I say? Nothing. This ailment is such... you don't say anything. You just think. Don't worry. You're lucky to have such a virtuous wife. She'll handle the house quickly. Look. She has come. Come, dear. I have fixed an auspicious date for your wedding. Kamla and Nirmala share the same destiny. Both are destined for eternal marital bliss... and her husband's love. So also are you. Nirmala's marriage? Yes. With Loknath. She is feeling shy. Nobody knows The pain of this wounded heart A fire burns within me Nobody sees the smoke Since the time her marriage has been fixed... this has been her plight Only the one who is pierced can feel the pain Nobody else Nobody understands this pain The pain of this wounded heart Pramila, did you see that? Yes. We raised the topic of Nirmala's marriage to Loknath... thinking it would make her happy. Did we make a mistake? Shall I tell you the truth? Yes, dear. That's why we have called you. You're her friend. You must know her feelings. If this marriage takes place, Nirmala will always be unhappy. She doesn't love Loknath. She is educated, virtuous, beautiful and good-natured. Aunt, Nirmala and Ramdas' match is made in heaven. That Benaras girl must be nothing compared to her. You think Ramdas likes her? I don't just think it. I know it for sure. What else can I want? Daughter-in-law should be good. Ramdas should like her. She should be virtuous. That Benaras girl is not a perfect match. Tell me everything about that girl. He behaved like that with a girl belonging to a decent family. I will go to Loknath right away and call off the wedding. Look. What's done is done. It's pointless to fight with Loknath now. Explain to him politely. Uncle, he shouldn't know that you know... about Nirmala's unhappy state. Go and tell Nirmala everything. She'll feel better. Go. I'll go right away. But let me tell you one more thing about Nirmala. You'll be glad to hear this. What? What? Did you hear, aunt? Now fix the wedding quickly. Your wish should be fulfilled. Ramdas should marry the girl of his choice. And we should get to eat sweets to our heart's content. Don't be so happy. What if Nirmala's parents reject the marriage alliance? Reject? Ramdas? Is there any such person in this world? Aunt, you just have to talk to them. Even if you talk to them on the phone, the match will be fixed. No. It can't be fixed without meeting them. So meet them this very day. Fine. Give me their telephone number. There's no need to see. I know everything about them. Talk to them. Yes. Yes. Wait a minute. Aunt, Ramdas. I mentioned him just now. - It's his mother. - No. Yes. She wants to talk to you. Come. Come. I am Ramdas' mother. Yes. I have heard that your daughter... has taken admission in Ramdas' college. Yes. I wanted to ask you... Yes. Yes? Yes. Gladly. I have heard many good things about your son. And... What? Yes, yes. Come whenever you like. It's your house. Thanks. - May I come today? - Surely. It's teatime. Have tea with us. Come soon. The tea may get cold. Okay. I'll come right away. Thanks. She's a very nice woman. Where did you go, Ramdas? Poor Moti had to come to call up in Benaras. Yes. And I had to even talk to her. She's a nice girl. That girl in Benaras. Yes. You've told me countless times, mother. I'm tired of hearing it. Good people are bound to be called good, son. Right, Moti? Yes, aunt. She's very nice. God bless you, son. You've lifted a huge burden from my mind. If you permit, I'll lift his burden as well. Both of you handle it. I have to go somewhere for tea. She'll be here soon. What will she say? - Who is she? - I don't know. But she's aunt's best friend. Best friend. She's coming for tea. Come on. Will you come or not? No. Why did you tell mother and father? When did I tell you I didn't want to marry Loknath? You didn't tell me. But I understood it. You claim to be very sensible. I'm feeling really shy. More than you felt at college... - in front of Ramdas? - Get lost. - You come. Otherwise... - What? I told them about Loknath. I'll tell them about Ramdas in the same way. What will you say? What is there to say? Nothing. But there are many things to say. - Tell me. Will you get up? - No. Go and tell them. No, my friend. Why would I tell them? If I had to say, I would have told them at that time. Come. Get up. Look, this glowing face has turned pale. Come. Freshen up. Change your clothes. This isn't bad. It's dirty. You're a naughty girl. I'm a girl, yes... but only Lord Ram or Ramdas knows who is naughty. Wait. I think you've found a better groom than I. - That's why. - No, Loknath. I'll have to search for a groom. Were you less suitable? You're my best friend's son. I'd have been very happy if you had married Nirmala. - But... - But? Nirmala and you will never be happy together. Why not? Because the two of you have different temperaments. - You only discovered this now? - No. I knew it before. But I became convinced of it only recently. - How? - Forget it. I assure you it wasn't easy for me to make this decision. But how did you find out all this? Very easily. Nirmala's friend Pramila lives in my neighborhood. And my sister is her friend. Do you understand? You're a fool. I accept all this. But when I went to save her, why did she fool me? To save herself from disgrace. If she had come with you, wouldn't this news... have spread all over the city? That Loknath ran away with Nirmala. And Ramdas released her. I didn't think of that. How could you? You need brains for that. Is that so? So this is your final decision? Yes, Loknath. I am sure that when you think about it calmly... you'll reach the same conclusion. I hope that we will continue sharing... good relations in the future as well. Yes. Okay... I'll leave now. I've seen you somewhere. I think so, too. Sit. Sit. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. This is Nirmala. And her friend, Pramila. I see. I see. God bless you, dear. God bless you. Where have I seen you before? Wait. You've never been to Jagannathpuri, have you? Jagannath? Yes. I did go there once on pilgrimage. It's been a long time. Nirmala was small at that time. - And you have a son. - Yes. Ramdas. Yes. Loknath's mother and we stayed at the seaside. Right. Now, I remember. Give me. Give me. Leave. Leave. - It will break. - No. Leave. My doll. Good. Good. - What happened? What happened? - He broke it. Don't cry. I'll fix it right away. - Look. - Yes. Yes. You aren't her father. He is.. Him! Ramu. Ramdas. It's him. It's him. It's him. It's him. It's him. - It's him. - What are you doing? Move. Naughty boy. You started fighting here as well. - Forgive me. - No, children are bound to fight. He's the cause of the problem. I won't play with him. I'll play with you. What can you and I do? They've already chosen each other. Dear? Listen. She ran away. I like your daughter. It's my good fortune. We shouldn't delay this auspicious deed. You said what I was going to say. I myself want Ramdas to get married as soon as possible. According to Nirmala's horoscope... there's a very auspicious date next month. There's only one auspicious date next month. And it matches with Ramdas' horoscope. It's a great coincidence. The gods have showered their blessings on this marriage. Fine. Let me see. Not like that. Cover your face, bride. Yes, you aren't going to college now. You're going to get married. But why? The groom is also modern. Yes, I've heard instead of a horse, he's coming in a car. He's worn neither traditional attire nor a flowery veil. Make her modern, too. Instead of a sari, let her wear a modern dress. - Will you wear it? - No. Don't act smugly. You're not married yet. If I want, I can still arrange for you to marry Loknath. Loknath won't attend the marriage? - Is he still angry with you? - No. I thought so, too. But it's been all cleared up now. You didn't see the gift Loknath has sent for Nirmala. Who sent this? Somebody must have sent it. Ask the bride. Bride. I don't know who sent it. Okay. Fine. Three guesses. Guess correctly and win the prize. Tell me. Mohan. Zohra. Rampyari. Neither Rampyari nor Ramdas. - So? - Loknath. - Is that so? - Why not? If a thief stops thieving, it doesn't mean... he's stopped being dishonest. Yes, he couldn't marry you but he still loves you. Lovers are very stubborn. They don't give up. You don't believe it? Our beliefs are unimportant. Ramdas has to accept it. - Has the marriage procession left? - Yes. A long time ago. They'll be here soon. - Hello. - Brajnath and Gehni. You've come. And Loknath? Over there. - You have come, Loknath. - Yes. Why wouldn't I come? I'm glad to know you're no longer angry with me. You still love us the way you used to love us before. What are you saying? Can that love ever die? Doesn't he know his father is your best friend? Yes. Loknath, why did you send such an expensive gift? - It's nothing. - Okay. Fine. - Sit. Feel at home. - Yes. - Nirmala Devi? Babu Rajnikant's daughter? - Yes. But she was supposed to marry Mr. Loknath. Yes, but Mr. Rajnikant cancelled it... and fixed it with Mr. Ramdas. They were supposed to tie the knot today but... lnspector, to which Loknath did you refer just now? Is it that man who lives at No. 3 Garden Lane? - He's very wealthy? - Yes, that's him. I see. Then I was wrong. Inspector, please do something soon. What if the wedding hour passes and there's no sign of Ramdas? Wait. He's a detective. It's possible he can help us with this case. Yes, sir, so what did you misunderstand? Pardon? Oh yes! I have just investigated a serious matter... whose case is being tried in court. But because of some reason, I thought perhaps... Loknath was also involved in it. But from the evidence of this wedding procession... I feel the matter is something else. What? Will you listen to my advice regarding this incident? - Of course. - Sure. You were just telling the inspector... that you were with Mr. Ramdas when the incident took place. Yes, I was sitting next to him. I see. If you will see any of the goons that attacked you... would you recognize him? - I think I'd definitely recognize him. - Okay. Do you know him? He was the leader of those goons. Go immediately and arrest Loknath. But this isn't Loknath. No. He's not Loknath... but a known wanted criminal... whose business is helping criminals with honest fronts... to perform serious crimes for big profits. This goon is also the culprit in my case. Now listen. Loknath, who is completely against this wedding... if he gets this goon released on bail tomorrow... after this goon attacks the wedding procession today... and abducts the groom. Now tell me, who is the real culprit? Loknath. Let's go. Sit down, Mr. Groom. Now stop worrying about your in-laws. Our boss has gone there now. He knows how to play the role of groom better than you ever will. Will you drink something? - Will you eat something? - No. You would have eaten something at your in-laws place, too. There are only two in-laws. Your wife's house or the jail. Now consider it your in-laws place, buddy. Motilal has gone to inform the police and we came here directly. We tired of searching for him. I wonder where the dacoits have taken Ramdas. Oh God! What a terrible thing to have happen! Sir, it's not the time to panic, but to think wisely. The auspicious wedding hour is passing away. Your daughter won't get a better wedding opportunity... - than this in this birth. - So what should I do? What should I do? Marry off your daughter to some other man. Don't let this wedding occasion slip out of your hands. The girl will definitely get trapped now. But the people of the new generation are present here. What if they don't listen to the priest? I am not inexperienced, Birenath. I've known them since childhood. They won't dare to step back from their ancient base. They won't miss this wedding opportunity. Don't panic. We've been ordered to keep you prisoner... till the wedding is solemnized. Then you'll be set free, young man. Till the wedding ends? Then it's fantastic! I myself don't want to arrive there during the wedding. But why? Actually, I'm being forced to marry this girl. And I want to run miles away from it. Really? It's better our boss doesn't come to know about it. Otherwise we would never have gotten this job. Yes, chief. You say you got this big job because of me. Of course. So we're friends. You saved me from this wedding and I got work for you. - Yes, it's fine. - All right. So, come on, shake hands, friends! Let's have a feast and celebrate. Release his hands. - Yes, it's fine. - It's fine. What if he runs away? How can I escape the clutches of so many brave men? Release him! I'll remain a spinster all my life, but I won't marry anyone else. Is it the curse of the soul of Loknath's mother? She made me promise her this wedding before her death. Does anyone get cursed without reason, aunt? Uncle is confused by the priest's talk there... and you're talking about being cursed here. What's the use of wasting time like this? Why don't the people go and find Ramdas? The sea should keep flowing, the cup of wine should be full Host, may you and your bar prosper I am grief-stricken, serve me a drink Host, please make the withered garden bloom again Host, show me that wonder again Please unite me with my estranged beloved one again The sea should keep flowing, the cup of wine should be full Host, may you and your bar prosper - Ramdas! - Moti! Are you Mr. Ramdas? Yes. These are your culprits. Please arrest them. I don't have much time now. I'll take your leave. - Let's go, Moti. - Go. - Wait. I'll come along too. Three constables should escort us... and the rest should keep watch on these goons. Come on. - Give me wine! - Take this wine. Did you hear this news, aunt? The priest is insisting... that this wedding opportunity shouldn't be missed. That Nirmala should be married to Loknath. As if it's not a wedding, but a sacrifice. This wedding will be worse than death for Nirmala. There's no time to think now. If you're hesitating, should I go and ask Mr. Loknath? But priest, I have to think about Nirmala's happiness, too. Sir, one has to judge both the boy and the family for one's daughter. And Loknath is promising in both respects. You had verified these aspects and chosen Loknath. Then our daughters become Sati under its effect. They adapt themselves to their husbands after their marriage. Once married, their husband's house becomes their heaven, their world. Sir, don't miss this wedding opportunity. Otherwise you'll regret it later. Does anyone gain such an alliance easily? Wait. Watch what happens. What else will happen? - Now Nirmala belongs to you and you... - Belong to Nirmala. - So get ready. - You're the groom. And we're the wedding guests - He has come! - The groom has come! - He's here! - The groom has come! He's here! - Here he is! Come on, daughter-in-law. Put it. Join your hands Give your hand. You take his hand. Tell me, beloved Why does the lotus bud feel elated on watching the moon? Tell me, beloved Why does the sunflower blush on watching the sun? Tell me, beloved, what is the reason? - Glimpse of beloved. - Yes. Glimpse of beloved. Glimpse of beloved. Glimpse of beloved Why does the bulbul sing melodiously during spring? What do I know? Ask the bulbul why it sings melodiously during spring? The bulbul unites with his mate Why is the garden of my heart in full bloom today? Why does my heart rhyme like the tune of a lute? - What do I know? - Whom should I ask? Ask your heart. My heart says the sunflower has made the lotus of heart blossom. The bulbul has met his beautiful mate. My life was lonely, my heart forlorn. You have enlightened it with your love. - It's dawn. - Yes, it's the crack of dawn. Have they awakened? They've only just gone to sleep. I think they spent the whole night talking. Really? Yes. A new bride. New happiness. Ten years ago a new bride kept me awake... the whole night talking. Why would I have kept you awake? You stayed awake by yourself. I am not talking about you. I'm speaking of a new, charming, beautiful bride... Aren't you ashamed to say these things at this old age... - And? - Move. If they're awake, I'll serve them tea. All right. You take tea for them. I'll go and pick some flowers. Yes. Madam is very fond of flowers. I know. Anyway, many have come and left here. But the way madam has praised my flowers... I was elated to hear that. Niti! Niti! - Will you take the flowers? - Of course. Then get up quickly. Otherwise your father will do it. - I will go. - Then go. Run. Your father must be picking the flowers in the garden. Go. Father, I'll take the flowers. Here. No, I will take them. Oh father, these aren't yours, but mine. They're mine. They love me and not you. Yesterday they gave me imported sweets and toys. Did you get any? Come on, give me. It is a very nice place. Quiet and beautiful. Away from the world. How long have you worked here, gardener? I've been here since arriving after marriage. You never visited your native place? This is my native place and home, madam. Sir has passed many generations here. Don't you get bored when staying here alone? - We are... - I'm first! I'm first! Sir, I have defeated father. Really? Father said he'd bring the flowers... but I snatched them from him. Take them. My darling queen. Look, Niti is so cute. Can anyone get bored in her presence? Wait. Stay there. Don't move. Don't move, Niti. Nirmala looks so beautiful with this child. A mother's form is the true form of a woman. She looks the most beautiful in this form. Nirmala always loved children. How she used to fight with the old gardener for the sake of children. She's got a gardener's child here too. All the photographs she sent... were taken with the gardener's family. It seems no one else lives in the area. It's an isolated place. Yes. They hardly receive any newspapers or letters. That's why I urged Ramdas' mother to send them there. Till Loknath's case is resolved, they should stay there. The decision of Loknath's case is made. Your son and daughter-in-law will return soon. There's nothing to worry about. Did you hear that? Okay, bye. Listen! I can't rid myself of the fear that... Loknath might put my son into trouble again. No, aunt. What can Loknath do from a jail cell? And after he's released? Who has seen those times? You're already aware that after that detective proved... Loknath was involved in many other serious crimes, too... the court sentenced him to lengthy punishment. We may never see him again. Rest assured. Did you hear? I'll really miss her. Give her to me. Take her, madam. We'll be relieved of the burden of her marriage. Madam is very fortunate. The way she is so fond of children... God will bless her with a child soon. Son, please inform us. We'll starve and come there to have a feast. Did you get leave? No, I want to write an important letter. To whom? The gardener. Gardener? Yes, the gardener where we stayed following our marriage. Why are you writing to him? Don't you remember he asked that we inform him... and he'd starve himself and come for the feast? So, I'm giving him the good news. How did you come to know? Pramila is Nirmala's friend. Mr. Motilal's sister is her friend. And Mr. Motilal is Mr. Ramdas' friend. Understood? Pramila? That witch promised me... she wouldn't reveal the secret to anyone. Let her come here once. I'll scratch her face. Definitely. If Pramila had been a man instead of a woman... I'd have helped you do this good deed. The boys drove me crazy at the college today. Someone called me a girl's father while another said boy's father. It's better that I leave college. Yes, it's really nice. No, no. Leave it. Leave it. No. Pramila used to say that Nirmala wants a son. May God grant her wish! Daughter-in-law. In both Ramdas and Nirmala's... birth chart, not just a son, but a grandson too is indicated. - Really? - Yes. If God wills, you may play with your children and grandchildren. You and me and our cute son Our house will be like heaven With the sweet laughter of the son... our heaven will constantly echo - Our son will grow up. - He will get a sweet bride - With the sweet laughter of the son... - our heaven will again echo - In these honeyed waves of life... - our heaven will constantly swing You and me and our cute son. Our house will be like our heaven The doctor has again gone to have a check-up. Let's see what he decides. Let's pray to God. My advice is the same as before. There's no chance of the child surviving. The mother might survive if an operation is performed immediately. Tell me, should the operation be performed? Why was the doctor so serious? What is the matter, mother? Who are you getting this ready for? For your grandson. - Alright, Nirmala... - is expecting again. Alright. May God fulfill her wishes this time! - But this time she's getting very scared. - Why? Last time's fear is entrenched in her heart, isn't it? It's been almost three years since that happened. The effect doesn't last for so long... on girls who can conceive, right? Don't you know how much she desires children? It was the poor girl's first child. And it was stillborn. This time her fears increase as the days pass. She'll forget all her sorrows and pain when she sees the child's face. May God grant my daughter a painless delivery this time! Hope. How can one rely on hope? It's a wire. It may break again. It never breaks, Nirmala. This wire is the foundation of life. Why would you be given a new life if it had to break? Live this life, brother. What 's the use of getting scared, brother? Life is a struggle, brother. Life is a struggle If you're so scared, why did you come... into the field of life, brother, into the field of life? The world isn't a bed of flowers It is a desire with thorns, brother, a desire with thorns Face life with courage, brother Life is a struggle, brother. Life is a struggle The one who gets scared, dies, brother The one who fights, he wins, brother Face life with courage, brother Life is a struggle, brother. Life is a struggle Give me courage. I won't give up hope. Then? My child? - Nirmala. - Mother. Nirmala. My child. I had so much hope. I prayed so much. Then why did this happen, mother? Why did it happen? From the last life there is a curse on your mother... due to which your children can't survive. So even this time I won't be fated to see the face of a child? No. No. I don't believe it. All this is wrong. Even I want that what you say should happen. But what can I do? Astrology can't be wrong. - Sir, isn't there any cure for this? - It is possible. If he gives his mother up or you give up your husband. No. No. All this is nonsense. If such things were true then... the houses of the world would have been routed. Come on. I won't let the child die. Child. Our child. He is crying out for life. I hear his cry day and night. I am leaving... Forever. Won't you even say a word? One sweet, beautiful word? No. No. Then I won't be able to leave. The child won't be saved. I am leaving. I... am leaving. Give me your blessing that our child survives, wherever he is. Nirmala? Nirmala? - What is it, Ramdas? - There's no sign of Nirmala. What? No. She didn't come here. What are you saying? - Ramdas! Ramdas! - What is it? What happened? What happened? Nirmala. There's no trace of Nirmala, anywhere. It is possible. If he gives his mother up or you give up your husband. Nirmala. Nirmala! Ramdas! Ramdas! And we had complete faith we'd be able... to locate her somewhere in the city or nearby. But when we found this shawl in the river entangled... in a stone, then we started having various doubts in our heart. Her name is written upon it. We thoroughly scoured the area around the river. But we were unable to locate her anywhere. Ultimately, being helpless, we came to this conclusion. She lost her way in the darkness of the storm, fell... into the river and was washed away by the water's force. I have killed Nirmala. If I hadn't taken her to that astrologer... none of this would have happened. She looks as if she's from a good family. How did she get here? Is she dead or alive? She's alive. Listen. Can you hear me? The poor girl isn't conscious. Don't scare me. Nobody will find out your secret from me. Alright, now we'll heat up some milk for you. It will settle your stomach. Even the child will gain strength. It's a natural occurrence As one departs the other arrives, brother Winter, summer, drought, spring It is a daily procession, brother Face life with courage, brother Life is a struggle, brother Face life with courage, brother Life is a struggle, brother Take it. Drink it. - I have heard this song. - You might have heard it. My father used to sing it while begging. Where is your father? The poor man died. He left me alone. That song is my only memory of him. This place has become desolate without him. - I don't like it here now. - Then where will you go? Ahead of this place there is a settlement of beggars. Where a lot of beggars live. I'm thinking of going there. What are your plans? I'm also alone. I can go anywhere. Why don't you accompany me, alright? There we'll both put up huts and live happily. They must be searching for me. What if they find me there? Who will come to look for daughters-in-law... from good, well-to-do families amongst beggars? Nor do the beggars care who comes and goes. You also come with me as a beggar woman. Did you hear? Before now I looked after father. Now I'll look after you. Both of our days will pass. Tell me, will you come? I'll come, sister. Your father had given me hope. It won't be strange that it may be fulfilled in your care. Throw the dice again, player As long as there is breath, there is hope Face life with courage, brother Life is a struggle, brother What is the occasion, today? Why the colorful preparations for a dance? Don't you know it? A boy has been born in our settlement. A boy. - To whom? - That new woman named Nimmi. To her. Alright. Alright. Come on, one more beggar. He will beg and feed. He won't take anything away, will he? What else? As long as he's small, we'll beg in his name and eat. When he grows big he will himself beg and contribute. - This is the way of our world. - Yes. Yes. Sister, my hope was fulfilled under your protection. God, may our child live a long life! My baby Krishna. Yashoda, play with this child The small, cute baby The big swings the cot makes Bless us that... our child lives... awakens. You stupid girl, is this a time to cry? Just look outside, at the kind of fun taking place. Bindi... today, on my behalf, make sure everyone... eats and drinks a lot. Take this. What will happen with this? Such a nice thing. Please give this, alright? No. No, Bindi. How can I give this? This was from him. Stars are settled in both the eyes They fool our mind The eyes are deluded - Well done. - Well done. When the baby would smile in his mother's lap And would give a sweet smile He would look adorable. And just win your hearts So cute and adorable So cute. And one of a kind Dear, apply some kohl. What if someone casts an evil eye on him? You don't know how to raise a child. - Then you raise him. - That's what will happen. Here. Oh! Why should I give up my son? Will you go to aunty? No. He is his mamma's boy. Mom and son are you going to play. Right? So be it. Don't come. I'll not take you along when I go to the Sankrat fair. Okay, Nimmi. Everyone will go have a bath. But you can't come out before night. Poor thing. Anyway, I'll get water for you and him on my way back. - Bindi, I'll always be indebted to you. - Silly girl. Now go to sleep, son. Will you go to sleep? Look. Please come. Sleep. Sleep Why don't you come? And put my son to sleep - Ramdas. - Yes, mother. - Are you going out? - Yes. When will you return? Who knows? Why? Son, it's Sankrant today. I'll observe a fast. I'll worship God. What's the point in wandering like this all day? You must get yourself busy. Come. Worship with me today. Worship. Worship isn't meant for sinners like me. I'm a murderer. Didn't I kill Nirmala? Oh Lord, will my son never find peace? Will all my reverence go wasted, Lord? It's the festival of Sankrat. Do some charity. Only the charity you do will go with you. Sir. Sir. You get quite a lot of alms. You got a child from somewhere and... started begging in his name. I shout my lungs out all day, but no one listens to me. Won't you come? The bathing ritual of Sankrant is going to happen. There will be plenty of charity. You have a child. You'll get plenty of alms. Who will give to us? Everyone gets what is in his destiny. Don't come. I'm going. If I could find a child, I'd take him with me for a while. Bindi said Nimmi is sick. She doesn't go anywhere. Let me see. She might give me. She's asleep. That's good. I'll take him quietly. I'm taking water for Nimmi and the baby. As you know, Nimmi is sick. She doesn't go anywhere. - Sir. - Do some charity, devotees. - Do some charity. - Sir. God bless you. Have mercy, master. - The child is hungry. - Here. Nimmi. Nimmi, where is the baby? - There he is. - Where? Get up. Where is the baby? My son? Where is he? That's what I'm asking. Where did my son go? Where did he go? My son! My son! What happened? What happened? I left both of them for a bath just a while ago. When I returned I saw Nimmi sleeping and the baby gone. - Have you seen my baby? - No. Have you seen my baby? Don't worry. Where did my baby go? Son. Son! Her son is dearer to her than her own life. She'll go crazy if she doesn't find him. Where can he go? Someone must have taken him to beg. He'll be found. Go and calm her. - Have you seen my baby? - No. Nimmi. Nimmi. - My son! - Go away mad woman! No. That wasn't my son. Where did my baby go? My son. My son. - Nimmi. - My son. He'll be found. He'll be found. He'll be found. He'll be found. Someone have mercy on the baby. He hasn't eaten for three days. - Here. - God bless you, sir. I've never seen a baby cry so much. You don't get me as much alms as much as you cry. - Quiet. Quiet. - Why are you beating him? He's crying. He can't live without his mother. - This isn't your child? - No. He's my sister's child. That's why you're beating him so mercilessly. - Where's your sister? - She's dead. I have to raise him. He's an orphan. I have to raise him. So this baby's an orphan? Yes, an orphan. Give him to me. I'll raise him. Who'll give me alms if I give him to you? I'll die of starvation. Your hunger will be looked after. Look at this! Oh wow! See! Did you see this? You are king. You are an emperor. You never cry. You never wail. And look at this. How does it sound? Tick-tick! Tick-tick! Tick-tick! Where did that sound come from? That clock! This is a watch and that is a clock. It's 4 o'clock. Come on, let's begin the play now. People are waiting. You play the king's role and I'll be your vizier. You sit here and I'll sit here. Lord, may my son gain peace through this child. I want to see my son happy once again before I die. Her name is queen sparrow. She chirps melodiously. Listen. Take it. And his name is Mr. Rattle. And his job is to rattle. Understood? Take it. Do you know him? His name is Bulldog Drummond. He sings melodiously. When you were young, I used to cheer up while playing with you. You've grown up now. You don't have any time away from your work. So with whom should I pass my time? You'll definitely have to marry this time. My daughter-in-law will come. The house will echo with the laughter of children again. I'll be able to play my game too. Huh! Munna doesn't have the right pose. How can I take the picture? Look, dear, he tried thrice today... but he's unable to take even one picture of Munna. I took one in my first try. - Look! isn't this Munna's photo? - Yes. You tell me. - Yes, it's his photo. - No. - Then? - It's of you. - Pardon? - Of course! - Look, don't you resemble him? - Exactly. While playing with Munna I often feel I'm playing with you. The same nose, the same face. Where was this till now? I've never seen it. No. Today when you picked up your camera before... coming to the picnic here, I remembered... that I used to take pictures, too. These fancy cameras are available now. We only had ordinary cameras then. But still take a look. isn't it? Yes. May you prosper. May you flourish, sir. Please feed the hungry. Madam. Take it. - Take it. - Give it to me. My sister is mad. - Take it. - Bless you, madam. Come on! Poor ones lead such miserable lives. I feel pity for that mad lady. Have mercy on us, Sir, God will bless you. - What is it? - My Munna! Sister! Sister, I have found my Munna! Leave him! Leave my Munna, witch! - Deceit! - You're a cheat! I was making my Munna go to sleep in my hut... As soon I dozed off, she stole him away! This... Leave him! Leave him! Nimmi, he's not your son. Return him to them. He is my Munna. My Munna. My son. Mad lady, it's been many years since your son was lost. How can your son be so young? Give here. He is my son. Get back! Thrash this wretched lady. Snatch the child from her! No, no, sir. Let her calm down. Then I'll explain about her. She won't harm your child. She's been roaming for years, looking for her child. This poor lady abandoned her home and family for the sake of a child. Really? When? Where? A long time ago... a big storm arrived one night. The next day I found her lying... unconscious outside my hut. If Nirmala's shawl hadn't been found near the riverbank... you couldn't have hidden your friend from me for so many years. It's such a beautiful frock. - Did you weave it yourself? - Yes. So, you've returned from college now? Don't keep away from your mother. Don't you remember that stick? It's such a deep scar. The boys must be teasing him that he got it at home... and daughter-in-law must have scratched him. Your father-in-law knows how to do this perfectly. Yes, I hope I haven't forgotten how. Darling Munna. Nirmala, do you remember? - You, me and our darling son. Our house will be like heaven - The sweet laughter of Munna - will echo in our paradise
