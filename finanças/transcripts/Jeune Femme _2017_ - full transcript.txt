Open the door! Let me in! - Surname? - Simonian. - First name? - Paula. 10 years isn't nothing! It really isn't! I didn't hang around! If he can leave, so can I! He didn't want to live there with me. Me neither. I tell you, I hate Paris! I loathe it. I hate France! That's why I left! And you know what? I'm adaptable, you know? Even in crap situations! I adapt! He told me I... I... that I needed to grow up! And the image of me he liked to photograph... wasn't really me. It was the woman growing in me... What's that mean? The woman in me? So I said: "What am I to you after all these years?" What am I to you? He said: you're a loser I still like sleeping with. And that's not the case for every loser! And the photo, the one that made him well known... It was a photo of me, huh? A photo of me! Would make me immortal. Well fuck being immortal! I want to be mortal! For once I want to have the courage to be mortal. It was starting to get a bit much. With the jet lag as well. And that flat of his! You need to see it to believe it! It's huge! He could have given me a cubby hole. I'd have been invisible! I mean, even a stinking dog... you let him in! My alarm clock that changed colour he took that, no problem! I won it on one of those games on a cereal packet. They have those in Mexico, too. He said we'd never win but I knew we could. Have you ever had a pond with water lilies? A pond, water lilies in your garden and a mountain behind? When we went to the beach we saw whales! This is a tantrum! It's dishonest! You see the trouble is I'm a weak person. I'm not very intelligent. It's true! I'm not so bright. It's OK! That's life. But I'm honest! But I'll tell you something: we were really alright. We were alright. What did you do all those years in Mexico? He's from a very wealthy family. And I'm not criticizing. I never wanted for anything with him. It was great. Have you ever heard of Joachim Deloche? No? I smashed my phone to bits. I smashed it to smithereens. Wham! Like that against his door. You should've seen it. It's still raining out there. Anyway, rain or sun it's all the same to me. At least snow's soft. Have you had any dark thoughts lately? No. No more than anybody else. Any family or children in France? Do you see any kids here? What about your parents? - We don't see each other. - Why not? We lost contact. - No brothers or sisters? - No. How come you lost touch? It was impossible sharing the same planet so I left. Out of politeness among other reasons. - Ever been in hospital? - I'm not that type. I don't know what you're implying but my health's fine. It's not because I'm a bit uptight that I'm ill. Aren't you supposed to be a doctor? I didn't say that. It's a question of fragility... Are you taking the piss with your white coat asking if I've ever been in hospital? I've never had tonsillitis. Never been ill. Never been hospitalised, Dear Doctor! This isn't about illness. People can be fragile... Oh, please! Keep your fragility for your clients! My patients! Patients. Sorry, I lost it. Surely that happens to you? All I know is you're putting your life at risk. If they bring you in like that again we'll have to keep you in. Excuse me a second. It's just that... I was everything to him and now I'm nothing at all. Sorry? I said I was everything to him and now I'm nothing. OK, you're a bit lonely at the moment but you're a free woman. Oh, fuck off with your freedom shit! Calm down, please. Freedom's for egotistical pricks! Please, calm down! What's with you? Wanna photo? Hello. I'll just change your bandage. Aren't you a bit young to be giving medicine to people? Something to calm you down and a painkiller, nothing special. Is anyone waiting for me? I don't think so. Try and keep still, please. - I'll just check the drip. - Sorry. Hello cat! What are you doing here? Excuse me, this is my cat. Come on, you. Damn it, Paula stop hanging about in the street! Go back home to Anne's, please. I'm not at Anne's. Where are you, then? Come down and you'll see. Very funny. Have you nothing better to do? I know your family's a bad subject but... Surely you have places to go and people to see? Or is this about the coats? You're copping out, Joachim. You're just a cop out. What you're doing is so cheap! It's really cheap! I'm not responsible for you, Paula! Know what? I'm going away. Far, far away, Joachim. And you'll never find me! You'll see, huh? You... you... promised we'd take a boat trip on the river Seine. Come on! Come down! What the hell is there to do here? For real? For real? At least open the door for your fucking cat! Shut up! Oh, shit. - Hi. - Hello. Do you sell toilet rolls individually? At the back, but I only sell packs. Could I have that? Can you guess who I am? Amy Winehouse. So you are! Recuerdas que querias ser una Marguerita Gautier? Sublime. It's Ruben Dario. - You don't know him? - No. Did you learn Spanish while you were there? No. Aren't you a friend of Joachim's who... You paint don't you? With blood from people with AIDS. I used to, a few years ago. We met! It was a very long time ago. No, I don't remember you. Your face doesn't ring a bell. That's not surprising. I knew you were a pain, Paula. I just didn't realise how much. Have you ever heard of Toxoplasmosis? I don't want cats here. I'm pregnant! Do what you like, take it... take it back to Joachim! It's his cat, isn't it? I feel sorry for your future baby. Seeing how you welcome me it must be freaking. I'd rather be on the street than with a couple of... Actually I'm not sure what you are or where you're from. You're right. You know what? Here's your bag. Now get out! I'm done with your poor orphan stories! Hey, Anne... hang on! Anne! Sorry! In that case could you lend me some cash? Please, don't put yourself out! Actually I'm not tired! Please, go back to bed. I'm fine. Thanks for the sofa. Sorry to bother you! Piss off, cat! I'm not tired. I hate... I never liked sleeping alone. Oh, yeah? I don't much like sleeping alone, either. You should get a cuddly toy. A teddy. That helps. Am I making you nervous? Don't worry, I'm in the champagne business. - Do you feel better now? - Not at all. You were pretty relaxed earlier when we were dancing. Look, I prefer not to get familiar if you don't mind. It's best at times like this. Give me your hand. Come on... This is not possible. Can't do this! - You've been crying! - No! You have! You've been crying. I haven't been crying. - You have. I like that. - Wow, you're a pain. I like that. It's touching. You know what? Go touch yourself! - Would you like a croissant? - No, thanks. Sorry, it was me who did that. It's just for one night. Forty six, the room and forty three. Which floor is it on? 4th floor. There's no lift. Up the stairs. Why did you go to Barentsburg for the project? How long did you stay there? I stayed for about 4 weeks. I've always been attracted to remote places... whose history isn't well known. Barentsburg is like that. 400 minors lost in the Arctic in a village which is pretty much unchanged since the Soviet Union. So, it's a pretty amazing place. Joachim Deloche, one of the most striking elements in the series is how isolated the inhabitants of Barentsburg are. Well, most of the inhabitants come from Donetsk in Ukraine... So they're isolated from the world and each other. People often stay at home. Bonds are created by the fact that they are all far from home. But in Barentsburg people are alone. Very, very alone. Mademoiselle Simonian... The neighbours are complaining about the meowing. Don't worry. I'll stop soon. I'm leaving anyway. Have you got a cat in there? Loads. I fatten them up and then I cook them to eat with apples. Like black pudding. This room's no-smoking. So why the ashtrays? - Decoration. - Oh, yeah? Look, can't you see I'm naked? If you don't mind... Empty that and clear this place up a bit. Why don't you ask your wife? Disgusting! Right, cat. You'll be fine. Look at all these houses you can shelter in if need be. Huh? You're not scared are you? It's not here. Where's their place? Ah, here we are. There you are, cat. You'll be fine here running about. You can meow as much as you like. Come on! Come out of there! Come on! Be brave, cat! By the way... er... I was wondering about how to pay you. I've no cash now but you know how it is in Paris cash is easy to find. I'll be back in 2 days. I'll have cash then but I can leave this piece of family jewellery. I'll leave it with you. Don't worry, you can trust me. I'll be back. - You've no money now? - No. Well, come back when you have. It's OK, it happens. I trust you. Come back when you can. OK? Thanks so much. For these, 25€ each. - All four? - Yes. This one's nicer. - 30€. - 30? That costs 150€! It's got nicks in it. It's damaged. It's got black marks on it. No. 30€. Sorry, but... That won't sell. That's junk. That won't sell. That's it. And if I add... these are silver. Excuse me, do you need staff at the moment? To wrap presents and stuff? No, sorry. Are you hiring at the moment? Yes. Can you tell me why you want to work here in particular? Love! I love the brand. The atmosphere... The products. They're beautiful! Is this shop part of the one on the 2nd floor? This is a knicker bar. Until the end of February. Then it'll be a stocking bar then a sock bar and in June, a bikini bar. I'd prefer the shop. It must be lonely here. Team work... Sonia, we've got enough Cocoons. We need to restock luxury goods. Forget the nightdresses. You and Melanie do the displays. Anna replace me at the till. I'll give this to the shop manager but I'm not sure you're suitable. You think I want a job in your knicker bar, snobby bitch? I'd rather die than work in your knicker bar. Do they let you work in that suit and tie? That suit's too small for you. This is just an outfit. It can be changed. But your eyes are different colours. That can't be changed. Well, you're not my type either. How well designed the world is. Perfect! Mind your business. - What's your type? - My type? Very different from you. A bit smaller, but tall, strong. Green-grey eyes. Salt and pepper hair. Photographer. About 50. Elegant. Women have no imagination. It's a shame. Paris has no space for imagination. There's too much money. You got a problem with Paris? Yeah. I think it's a city which doesn't like people. Don't you? - It's a beautiful city. - Oh, yeah? For example what do you get out of it? I feel incognito here. Since when's that been a plus? It suits me. The women are beautiful. Of course, that's it! You guys. Always the same old song. I didn't say "you", I said "women". And stop being so familiar! Sorry... The same film as that lady. Immortal Kingdom, Renaissance 3? I wasn't sure if it was you or not. How come you never tried to find me? What about you, all this time? Well? All you ever did was leave. Just like your father. Shall we have lunch? I'm working afternoons again. It makes for long days. That goes over your head having never done a day's work. That's not the point. See you at home? I don't want to see you again! Not here, or at the house or anywhere! Yeah, but I didn't know! No, I can't go. Will you tell him? Yeah, it's all going really well. Look, I'm in the metro it's gonna cut off. I'll call you back, OK? Aren't you Princess Sarah? That cartoon! Remember me? We went to primary school together in Venissieux! No? Sarah Cremades? I'm not dreaming! Aren't you Sarah Cremades? Yes, you are! I knew it was you! How's it going? What you been up to? So, what about you? - You're in the shit. - No. I saw you crying in the metro. I don't miss a trick. You used to be so chubby! How you've changed! But heterochromic eyes like yours aren't easy to forget! I know. At school I was amazed how cold your hands were. Let's see. You see? They're so cold! - Thank you. - Want some? So, what's up? Running away? Splitting up? Yeah, well... It's just temporary. I'm... I'm... I've got a flat that's being done up, ready at the end of March. I'm in a hotel right now but I need to find somewhere. What about Lyon? - Lyon? - Yeah. That would be the same. Wherever you are... It's all about fitting in. So you're staying here to be near him. - No! - I get it. As a kid you wanted to leave Lyon. Did I? Yes! Didn't you? Hey! I forgot about that! Yes. So... You're a free woman. That's good news! At last we can get laid! Don't look so happy! Ah, you're joking! You look tired... We're gonna buy you some kiwis. Kiwis? And maybe some crisps? There's something I should tell you... I told you, don't worry about money. I'm rich at the moment, OK? Stop worrying! Do you have to go to work tomorrow? Is it important? Very important. But I'll be back soon. I'll put you in contact with a friend to help for a job. Her name's Eli. She's really cool. Do you live alone in Berlin? Yes. Why? And happy to be so. You'll call her won't you? She might find you a place as well. I don't want you to rot away here. Why did you say happy to be so? About living alone? I've got better to do than being in a couple. Princess, what's that mark? It's nothing, I fell over. Yeah, I believe you. You fell from the sky. I'm really glad you've stopped seeing that creep. In the family from hell can I have the mother... the cat... No seeing him again, huh? Are you mad at me? - What about? - You know! No. You prefer dicks. You don't know what you're missing. Have your bath. The water's going cold. Turn round. Turn round. Yuki! Turn round. Merry Christmas! You nutcase! Seek fleeting, intense affair with virile (hairy) male. Hobbies: water ski, delta plane. In need of excitement. Serious answers only. Hello. I saw your advert and wanted to say I'm not exactly the man you want but I'd love to try those sports so if you're interested... my name's Paula... You can call me on this number. Have a good evening! And by the way I'm also looking for a job. Hello. Hello... Sorry, do we have an appointment? Sorry, on the phone you sounded under 18! Oh! Me too, I thought you'd be more upper class. Excuse me talking to you like this. How funny! I should've said I'm older. Is it a problem? - No. On the contrary. - Really? - Sorry I'm rushing. - No problem. Your little girl's got character! - She's a bit wild. A little tiger. - Is she? Good for her. I was like that when I was small. But you mustn't worry. It works out in the end. Parents always worry! It's Lila's dad's flat but he no longer lives with us. That's OK. We weren't in love but I do love this flat! So much the better then. It certainly seems a good deal. The flat's lovely. - This is a bit silly. - What? Let's use 1st names we're the same age. That's true. It's an advantage. - Thank you. - Yes. What's this? Ginger! Lila and I love this kind of stuff. - Good isn't it? - Delicious! Lila's cute but since September she's always sulking. Oh, really? Since Djamila left I've had a lot of SOS baby sitters and all that. So as we have the maid's room I thought that would help... and of course it suits me financially! Of course and given the current situation it's great to have a maid's room for that. Very intelligent! And what's your job, if you don't mind me asking? Well... I was an accountant. I'm a dancer now. - Really? - I set up a company and I teach. Really? I can just see you. You have that energy. And you? Have you worked with kids a lot? Oh, I love children! In fact I didn't ask for your references! That's true, you didn't! But I love children. This way. We'll use the servant's stairs. On the phone you said you're a student? Yes, I did. What subject? Er... arts. Oh great! Lila loves drawing. Oh really? And then you'd teach? Er... that could be an idea, yeah. It's that last door there. Right... Sorry, I haven't been up here for ages. There should be clean sheets in the wardrobe. That's not leaking... and the radiator works. I'm sorry I have to fly! There's a 2nd room here. So I'll leave you to look. Think about it. If it's OK for you it's OK for me. - Fine. - Let me know, OK? Yes. Oh, poor little plant! You're not going to last the winter, are you? Sorry, cat. It's a bit manky. While we build our strength up. Mummy doesn't like us standing on chairs. Doesn't she? Does that mean I should put this away? We only eat pancakes on pancake day. Really? Yes, really. Hey, Lila, watch this! - Make them with me. - No, I don't want any. Want some of this? Dulce de leche. Do you like that? Too bad. Have you been smoking? No. Why do you say that? Well, why did you leave the little window open? I don't know. To air the room. Shall I plait your hair? Chocolate plaits OK? No! Where are you going? You've reached Joachim Deloche. I can't take your call now. Please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Hi, it's Paula so... er... hello. Just wanted to let you know that everything's OK. That's all. Maybe you can hear, I'm listening to music with friends. That's all. So everything's OK. Sorry I must be calling in the middle of the night, so, bye. I got your message. Good to hear from you. You seem in good company. But that's good. If you're OK. Apparently you're not in need of anything. Actually I saw you pass by the other day in a weird coat. Carrot or red brick coloured... Carrot! What crap! You know what I mean. Red brick, OK. So... Could you bring the cat back? Please... I'm counting on you. Love you. We called you because we need someone immediately for the stand and 2 shops at Place d'Italie. Is it for a permanent job? No, not exactly. Is it interesting? I don't want to put myself out if not. - It's a good job but not permanent. - OK. My failing is I'm a bit obsessive. I love tidying up... I love... I like things clean. No, really... that can be seen as a failing. It is a failing as well. My good point is I love organisation. And I'm calm. If I say "challenge"? What's your reaction? I feel excited. Why? In your life have you often been faced with challenges that you've had to take up? Yes. Exactly! For example? I do a lot of sport. Oh, sports! Which sports? Lots... Lots of sports. Different... very... I like... I like... variety. Each sport's a new challenge. This is a new challenge because the team's female. And the thing with women is they cut to the chase! Yes, a team of women who work well together. But I must warn you you're not there to shoot the breeze. We are rigorous most especially where nails and makeup are concerned you need to be impeccable. - Feminine. - Like this? Yes, but for example your lipstick's wrong because it's not colour coded with the shop. But we'll explain that later. However unvarnished or bitten nails are unacceptable. That's for sure. In any case we'll call you this evening to give you a positive or negative answer. That's all. Well, it was... OK. Thank you very much. Thank you. You're welcome. My pleasure. I need to see the next candidate. Oh yes, of course! OK. OK. - Thank you very much! - Thank you! I'd adore to work here! Everything going OK? I'm really happy. Never been so happy. How about you? I'm alright. It goes through the top and bottom. Then pull it tight, 1-2! On the other side make sure it's the same height. So you do that and I'll put them on display. You're full time. Morning and evening between here and there? No, I don't do that. I do other stuff. I'm finishing my thesis. Really? What's it on? It's on... it's a bit complicated to explain. Basically it's on surgery for birds. That's good. I mean the thesis and the surgery. Yes, I know. But in fact lots of the people here do other stuff. For example there are lots of girls... Cecile up there... she's a graphic designer. Graphic designer? - You don't know what that is? - Yes I do. But I'd misunderstood. - And what do you do? - Nothing. I'd like to go back to school. But it's complicated isn't it? Going back to school's brave but what will you do after? I don't know. Now is now. Quite right. That's totally it. I'll put some music on. Hello. Who is he? His name's Ousmane. He, on the other hand, is here all day. Hello? Hello? Hello? Paula is that you? - Hi, Paula. - Oh, sorry. Excuse me. It won't work without the reed. Sorry. It's the family's. I'd rather you didn't touch it. Of course. - So I finished all the housework! - That's great! - Classes going OK? - Yeah. Yeah, well... In fact I'd better get going. - Thanks. - Thanks. An Orient Cloud size 42 for the night corner fitting room. Knicker Bar? What sizes are left in pearly grey? Guys, the client coming with an insipid yellow bag wants something by Pretty we don't have. Palm her off with something by Mimosa. I repeat our numbers are down. Meeting at midday. Did you say something? I said enjoy your lunch. Enjoy your lunch, too. A piece of advice: Turn the intercom off at times. Take a breather. Save your energy. Don't play their game. I need to get them on my side first. They'll never be on your side. Why not? Those girls never stay long. Oh, yeah? But I need this job. Have some of this. It's better than that rubbish. Wow, it's really good. Is that wifey who prepares your lunch box every night? So, why do they keep you on? Nour says you've been here a year? I'm resistant, that's all. What do you think about all day long? Stuff. My family, the future. My country. I escape. What's that mark? Have I asked you where you got your scar? Paula your break's 30 minutes. Not 35. Let's play making up songs using everyday words like teaspoons and vacuum cleaners. No. I don't want to. A guessing game? Guess what my job is? No! - I don't want to. - I don't either! Lila, why don't you like me? That's not true. I never said that. I want candy floss flavour. Candy floss? Not those. They're the pink ones. Thank you. Your favourite's candy floss. I've never tasted it. What? You've really never tasted it? No. How odd. It's unusual. Like this? You can break off big chunks, too. Like this. And that's a little bird which is very ill-mannered... Now then! You're the little bird. And what's her name? Her name's Rokia. And she loves doing this in fact when she comes here we always do this. Me too, I love it! I'll take you on a tour of the mall. That'll take hours! No! Thirty minutes. An hour. It depends. Can you see the state I'm in? I've been waiting 1 1/2 hours! I came home to this mess! I'm sorry. You see... I didn't have time to wash up because... That's why I pay you! What do you do all day? I'll do it now! I don't want you to do it now! Now is my time with my daughter! - Don't you get it? - Of course. I'm... And what the hell did you get for dinner? Frozen lasagna, sweets and goldfish! The little one wanted lasagne! The Italian deli was closed so we... The little one? Who decides what she eats? It's organic! I give her fruit. She wants sweets. I'm always mean mummy! I'll hide them. I didn't know I was doing wrong! Stop buying them! I don't give you money to buy this crap! You just have to tell me. It's OK. I'll stop. I'm sorry. What's more we had a great day. We were at the shopping centre. We tried on some nightdresses in the shop I work in. You tried on nightdresses? - No! - That's great for little girls! No, but for her they're dresses. They're long... - We said 7pm. - I know. 7pm means 7pm. If there's a problem, call! My phone was down. - And who are those people? - Who? You see friends, your boyfriend with my daughter? - No! - And the big black man? He's a friend! Ousmane. - A work colleague. - A stranger! What do you do, by the way? Are you a salesgirl or a student? I'm lost! I'm a bit of both. You see I... Right, Lila! Get in the bath! Yes! Wash your hair because you don't smell nice. The concierge says you've got a cat? Yes... Why didn't you tell me? Sorry. I didn't dare. I was afraid... I didn't dare... Now the property manager's after me. - There's cat shit everywhere! - No. The room's too small for a cat so I leave the door ajar... I know it's too small. And for that reason you put that cat elsewhere! Give it away, or... Lila, I told you to get in the bath! Will you give me... Lila, get in the bath! Coming, sweetie. Mummy will give you your bath. See you tomorrow sweetie! You know what Paula? I feel let down. Everything was OK. I trusted you. And then... I don't know. You've lost it. And this goldfish looks awful. Damn it! Paula, it's me. Why aren't you answering my calls? I'm quite worried. Are you still in Paris or have you left? Where are you? Call me. Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK. You need something? Yes. Would you mind looking after my cat? What's it called? Muchacha. It's a female. She's really cute. She has some issues. Cat hair everywhere. She likes eating off your plate. - She's annoying but cuddly. - Like a woman. It's not really urgent but... if by any chance you could... maybe we could meet up later... Do you know what you remind me of? A little wild monkey. Does that mean yes? We'll see. Where's your lovely spotty tie? How long have you been a watchman? I have a degree in economics. This is a stop gap. - Whilst waiting for what? - Some projects. I hardly recognized you. - Hello. - Hi. Are you OK? I didn't know you were still in Paris. Well you see... there's always... a kingdom of knickers awaiting to pamper you. Oh, do you work here? Well, you look great! Thank you. Are you OK? Can I help you out somehow? Yes! There's a great chip shop you should try on -2. I don't feel like chips right now. Sorry, I don't have time to talk. OK. Anyway... See you soon. - Is the job going OK? - Yes, fine. Look at your finger! You didn't bandage it! - It doesn't matter. - It's revolting. It's nothing. It's ready! The eggs are ready! To put your mind at rest, you don't need an MRI. The dizziness and headaches are normal. You're pregnant. You move very graciously. Even your face. And the lines on your face. So precise. I mean it! I'd notice you in the street. You're striking. People don't notice me. It's true! People don't remember they've seen me before. I assure you! - Your shoes. - Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. The coconut matting scratched my bum. - Sorry? - The last time I saw him. He was staying with a photographer friend. He had coconut matting on the floor. And er... sorry! I hate that matting, but I really wanted to make love. So I forgot about the matting until afterwards. We had a huge argument. I was all scratched. Is this pregnancy planned, unwanted? Is it good news for you? Well I never said it was unwanted. I'm only asking you because you said you're on the pill. Yes. Careful! Just a little. When we returned from Mexico well... he talked a lot and I kept crying and vomiting. That must have been when I lost a pill. So it's not exactly planned. But it's not unwanted you know? It's not unwanted... I mean... If we stuck to everything we want and that alone I think life would be a drag, wouldn't it? It's for you to decide if your situation is stable enough to envisage keeping it. Stable? What does stable mean? You told me in exchange for a room you baby-sit. You just arrived in Paris... A child needs love but I think it also needs stability, doesn't it? I lived in the same hole 'til age 15. 15 years of stability. At the first sniff of instability I was off. Stability's boring. What do you know about love? What I mean is... do you know how you were conceived? Was it some drunken night with a madman or a pervert? It's true! You're just glad you're here! Well, I know it's love but that's all I know. I totally agree with you. You're old enough to decide what's best. You're young, full of energy. That's what counts. Young! Hang on. That's easy to say. I'm 31. 31 is nearly 40. That's enough of a reason. A reason for what? A reason for life. For everything. Here. Have a toffee. Thank you. Didn't you say you're 29? I'm 31. Same thing. Listening to yourself is important. Be attentive to what's going on. Understand yourself. I feel like I'm on a TV programme. With the expressions you use. Why stay in Paris if you don't know anyone? Paris or elsewhere. Got to make a home somewhere. And your parents? My dad's dead. It's complex with my mum. And your partner's family? Even worse. Alive but appear dead. Is there anyone you can talk to? Yes. In fact I've so many people to talk to, it's... You wouldn't think so but look at us for example. I'm sure it'd be easy for you to open up to me if we could carry on talking a bit. You're right. No, not here! Not here! Further away. Still further! - Further? - A bit further! There. Here? Paula! Where are you? You scared me! Love is a rebellious bird It has never, ever known a law Love me not, then I love you If I love you, you'd best beware Oh, sorry! Hello. How many times did you pee in the pool today? - None! - Fibber! I said I didn't! I was next to you. I smelt it. A warm current. Yes? - Mummy's put an advert in. - An advert? What for? To find a new babysitter. She says you don't correct my homework properly. And we hang about outside too much. And what do you think? I don't think it matters if you don't correct my homework properly. - Wait, I'll plait yours. - OK. It doesn't matter. Paula? Are you sad? Why have you stopped talking? Yes. I'm a bit sad. Aren't you sad? Oh, no! That's disgusting! That's why I'm being fired! Because you're so naughty. You find that funny? - No... - Do you think it is? No. At what age were you adopted? 1789 my dear. And my brother in 1901. Go for it because I'm smelly. Actually I'm pregnant. That's impossible. I haven't even touched you! That's not nice! So that's why! That aura! Those eyes made for creation. This beautiful body. What crap! Well I never. Hey, I'm cold. Have you got a T-shirt for me? Yes. On the bed. I'll be back! Did you find it? What are you doing? You're not Sarah. Who are you? Well... I'm... I'm... I'm me. That's me. - Is that what you do for cash? - No. You pretend you know people? That's not why. I swear it's true. I'll reimburse you right now. That wasn't why. Fuck! You're a great liar! No, I didn't lie to you. Yuki, I didn't lie to you. But when I saw you in the metro. When you spoke to me I wanted to have you... to feel... as if I'd known you for ever. Get rid of that! It's true! I want... Please believe me. I'm not lying to you. I didn't lie to you. Slap me if you want. I didn't lie to... Excuse me. Your mobile's ringing. And you've still got your badge on. And you've still got your tie on. My mum used to say ties are passports for thickos. Really? It wasn't hers. It was a quote. Sadly I only remember quotes. At least you remember something. I guess so. Are you sure you've found a job? You've found a new job, mum? You're driving me nuts! Thanks. Are you happy with your professor? After ten years. Aren't you bored without kids? Did you have me because you were bored? No. That wasn't what I meant. I forgot the Tornado thongs. That's why. What's going on? You've stopped answering my calls? I found you thanks to Anne! I'm at work. Please go. What the fuck's going on, Paula? I'll give you your cat back. By the way the cat's a female. What are you on about? I want to know how you are. You're not saying. I'm fine. I went somewhere else to see if you were there. But you're not. That's all. - Nice little flowers. - Stop it! What? What's the matter? I'm pregnant. Who's the father? Me? No, the cat. Of course. It's yours. Now please, go. I've work to do. I finish at 7. Stop. Go on. Please leave me. Please, leave. Why are you looking at me like that? So, where are you living? In a maid's room. It's a mouse hole. With the cat? No, not with the cat. The cat's with a friend. Because of toxmo-plasmosis. You do know what toxoplasmosis is? Of course I do! Do you think I'm stupid, or what? Who's the friend? A knicker shop colleague. A knicker shop colleague. Great. Look. This baby, I don't know... I think it's beautiful it happening like this. It's crazy but in the right way. So is it crazy or is it right? Both. When things are unexpected you know how I like that. It reassures me. And you? How do you feel? Are you eating? Sleeping? Are you tired? I'm OK. I wasn't expecting this. You staying in Paris. Nervous breakdowns, A&E. This news makes me feel like a kid. Paula, what's up? Wake up, wake up! You had to take action. I hate to think of you alone, pregnant, in that job... hanging about. Firstly I don't hang about. Second, I like the job a lot. Third, I think kids should grow up being thrown in the deep end where there's noise and activity and contact, you know? I think that's great! Look, drop that shit job. Move in, and take a rest. "Shit job"? - Paula, you know what I mean! - Shit job. Come on. Please. I miss you. In fact it's as if you... put me in the dirty linen basket and now you want me back. Paula, stop it. You're crazy! I feel something I've never felt before. What? I feel nostalgic. What are you nostalgic about? Stuff I've never done. Stuff that I haven't done yet. I'm sorry, we're closing. I'd like to go back to school. To study what? Well... literature for example. Since I've known you I've never seen you finish a book. You did sod all in my classes. You could have taught me things in 10 years! You could have! Instead of just taking my photo! Bubble baths and all that crap. I saw the photo in the gallery in Paris! I was so ashamed! Is that love? Our love? It's ugly! There's no beauty. Your shots of workmen have more beauty. You see? You learnt how to decipher an image. Before I had no opinion. Now thanks to you... I didn't say that. You're exaggerating. Wait 2 or 3 days before handing in your notice. Go back to school if you want to. Do what you need to. But I need you at the private viewing. Yes. Really? Yes. OK, I'll be there. The next one's my stop. Want to sleep at mine? I have to get up early. Here. I brought you this. Thanks! - Hello? - Hello! It's Paula. Sorry I know it's late. - No problem. Cross the courtyard. - OK. Come here. This way. Your little girl's here! She's lovely. Are you thirsty? Hungry? Very hungry. There's plenty to eat. I brought this. I didn't want to come empty handed. I don't drink. Me neither. Here. I'll serve because last time you broke 2 glasses. - You're making me drink? - Yes. And I'm drinking alone. OK. I'm drinking but you're eating. Ousmane? I'll make some tea. I'm not going to keep the baby. Why? Don't you feel capable? No, that's not the reason. I just wanted to let you know. Beforehand. Is this your revenge? No. You don't love me anymore? You don't love me anymore, either. Stop it. Come here. Come here. Stop it! Stop it! Stop! I'm sorry. Subrip by DanDee Subtitles: Olga Helm Subtitling: HIVENTY
