Hey! Hey! Ha ha ha! Yeah! Wa-hey! Yeah! We are not lost! We are somewhere around here. I told you, we're lost! We should've brought a compass. I don't need a compass! No, that's east! We've been walking north since we set off. But... we turned west at the river. It's that way! It's getting dark soon. You play with your GPS. I'm going this way. Akito? Akito! Akito? Akito?! Akito?! Akito?! Jen, you seen the headlamps? Hey, Jen? Hey, Jen? Y-yeah, I'm in the bathroom. You know where the headlamps are? Oh, yeah, um... they're in the kitchen. I'm charging them. Oh, have you seen my phone? No. Uh, but I'll have a look when I get out. Well, better hurry. They're here. What time do you call this? Ah, you said 10am. Yeah, on the road at 10am. It's already 10:05. Oh. How do you live with this guy? I just let him think he's in charge. - Hi. - Mwah. Oh, yours. Ah. Thanks. Where was it? It was just on the sofa inside. You two - smile. Aw! I got that torch you told me to get. Oh, God. Tell him about the torch. Took out a second mortgage to get that thing. 120 hours of full charge. Worth every cent. Guys, get in. Group shot. - Alright, let's hit the road. - Nice. So, uh, I read your latest article. 10 best bars in Bucharest. Tough assignment. Worst hangover I ever had. You've got the cushiest job. This might be a little tricky, though. But it'll be worth it. How'd you find out about it? Oh, my mate Cash. He runs tours out of Cairns. Cash? You'll see. So, anyway, we're over in Puerto Escondido. I look across and I see this crazy bastard. He paddles into this monster wave. This thing was huge. It was near vertical, right? He gets completely wiped out. Fucking boom! Like, this thing explodes on this head, right? So I race over on the ski and I had to haul his sorry arse out. Oh, get off! - I see what you mean. - Mm-hm. So, this cave? Mmm. What I can tell you is this thing is unexplored. Right? You won't find this on any of your caving websites. Yeah, see, that part doesn't really excite me very much. It's all good, mate. I cannot believe I let Eric talk me into this. You say that every time. What is that, water? Not pregnant, are you? Wait. You're not? Oh, wow! Really? That is amazing! Yes, but please don't say anything, OK? I haven't even told Viktor. Why? He's gonna be so excited when you tell him. Yeah. It's just... not something we've ever spoken about. - Well, surely... - And what about you? No, Eric would freak out. You know, things have been kind of... bad for us. Um... Sometimes I get the feeling he's keeping his options open. Well, remember Simmo? Remember that time when he was like... ..he's coming off the bloody pier and he's straight into the water? Simmo's bloody mad, that guy. You want to dance? Yeah? What? Nothing. Let's not do this. Let's just go somewhere by ourselves, huh? Like an island. We can sit on a beach, get massages, order room service... I thought you said going into remission meant you want to live life to the full. I do. It's just... I mean, don't you want to experience something new? Eric can send me the photos and I'll make the experience part up. I write most of my stuff from the hotel anyway. I think it's time you experience the real thing. - Really? - Yeah. - Morning, Prince Charming. - Morning. Hey, don't forget, I found this cave. I'm going in first, alright? Thought we were gonna toss for it. Toss this. So, how did you find this cave? I was in a search party last week looking for those missing Japanese bushwalkers. I was searching through the forest and I stumbled across this shaft. I shine my torch in. This thing goes way down. Any luck, she'll lead to a bigger system and, uh... we can start making some money. And what if it doesn't? Well, then we'll be back in town in time for another party, then, won't we? Eric's shout. Did you see that? Oh, yeah. Hey, are there many crocs around here? Yeah, a few, now that we can't cull 'em. Relax. If some nasty croc thinks he's got an easy lunch... - Jesus! - Whoa! What the fuck?! What? It's not loaded! The clip's in the glove box. Did you ever find those missing tourists? Nah, not yet. Yeah, this is it. - So, where is it? - It's up through there. What do you reckon? Yeah, it's moving south. We'll be fine. Welcome to Cash's Cave. Well? What do you think? Let's go find out. Looking good. You ready, big fella? Yeah, it's all good. You can go first. You've never done this before, have you? Yes, course I have. Wrong way round, mate. Huh? - Ready? - Mm-hm. So, when you're on, it's one hand on the brake all the way down. Mm. - Right, be careful. - See you at the bottom. Yeew! Ready? Ready as I'll ever be. Whew! - You right? - Yeah, totally. Whew! That's it. Nice work, guys. Almost there. Keep coming. Nice! Attaboy. Nice. Look. Over here. What do you reckon? Uh... what if there are snakes in there? Eric will get bitten first, then, won't he? Go. After you. Oh, God. Alright. Here we go. Hope no-one's claustrophobic. Probably should've asked that before we came down here. Mmm. Oh! - You right? - Yep. Everyone OK? Yeah. This looks promising. I wonder how far it goes. What if we get lost down here? I mean, no-one knows we're down here, right? I don't know. We won't get lost. We should keep moving. Yep. Come on. I've got a good feeling about this. Lead the way. Oi, check this out. - Oh! - Oh, what is that? It looks like a... a goat or something. So, we're not the first ones down here, then. How did it get down here? Where do you reckon that's coming from? Just seepage. Careful, guys. Gets a bit tighter up here. Whoa. You feel that? What? Space. Careful. It's low right here, guys. Watch your step, guys. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! This is what it's all about. This makes it a cave worth exploring. Holy shit, man. We are in business! - What did I tell you? - Yep. Well done. - Let's check it out. - Yeah. Let's have a look over there. You guys coming? - After you. - Come on. Watch out for this. You good? Cold? Little bit. Nah, it's not too bad. You right? Yeah. Don't need me to hold your hand? It's just seepage, mate. Maybe. It's running pretty fast, though. Yeah. Probably a natural waterway. Cave river tours. Oop. Oh, shit. Thought I checked those batteries. What happened to the light? Oh, shit. I don't like the look of this. I think we should head back. Are you serious? Mate, this cave's just getting started. A little bit of water's not gonna hurt you. Oi! Inspired? This is incredible, huh? Hey? Hey! I think there's something in the water. What the hell is that? I don't know. Jen! Jen! Help! Help! Jen! Grab my hand! Grab my hand! Jen! Viktor! Viktor! Help! Jen! Faster, Jen! This way. Come on. Are you OK? You're OK. You're alright. You're alright, darling. I lost my bag. OK. We'll find it. We'd better. Had my keys in it. Where in the fuck did that water come from? It was the rain, wasn't it? Didn't you say that we were on the edge of the storm? No, that's got to be more than that. That river must have burst its banks. So, how are we gonna get out of here, then? Oh. Here. - What? Hold on. - Fuck! Hold on. Hold on. Fuck! Does anyone have service? There's not gonna be a signal down here, guys. We're gonna have to go back the way we came in. It's gonna be underwater. I'm not going underwater in this cave. I'm just not. OK? Look. It's only a short passage. Once we clear that low rock, I reckon we'll be above the waterline. Well, we could just wait for the water to go down and... and then we'll... ..we'll just swim back out the way we came in. - No, we can't wait. - Why? The cave's filling up. Look. The water's still rising. We're gonna be in the water whether we like it or not. Fuck. Wait. I saw something. Before the water hit. What? It was over there. I don't know. I'm not going. I'm not going back in the water in this cave. Hey. Look at me. It's only a short swim. I'll go first and check it out, OK? It's gonna be fine. Let's just stick together and stay calm. You right? We need to find that backpack. Alright? We're not going anywhere without those keys. - Yeah? - Yeah. What's that? It's Cash's bag. This is it. I'll go down and make sure we can get through. 10, 15 seconds max, I reckon. Be careful. What was that? - Viktor? - Where did he go? - Viktor! - Viktor? - Viktor! - Viktor? Viktor! - Viktor! - Viktor, where are you?! - Viktor?! - Viktor! - Viktor! - Viktor! - Viktor! - Stop! Wait! Get out of the water! - Viktor! - Get out of the water! Viktor! Viktor! Viktor! Oh! Get her out! Arggh! Viktor! Viktor! Eric, get out of the water! Come on! Come on! Viktor! Viktor! Get up! Get up! Oh, shit! The bag! Oh, fuck! It's not Viktor! Fucking hell! Viktor! Viktor! Viktor! Get out of there! - Get out! - Get out of it! Viktor! Viktor! - Viktor! - Viktor! Oh! Oh, it's coming! It's coming! Get him out of the fucking water! Viktor! It's coming! Oh! Get up! Get up! Run! No, no, no! Get up! Get up, get up, get up! Oh! Viktor! Viktor. Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. Can you talk? - Yeah. - OK. Oh, God. Alright. - Oh, God. - Oh, shit! Oh, God. Is he OK?! Is he OK?! Oh, fuck! He kept trying to roll me. Move back in close. Step back. Hey, buddy. This is gonna really hurt, alright? One, two, three. - Arggh! - Sorry. Sorry. You've got to sit him up. Up you get. OK. - I'm gonna come up the back. - Yep. Good thing he spat you out, huh? Must've not liked the taste of me, huh? Good work. Good work. Thanks. We need to get him to a hospital. This is one of our missing bushwalkers. Those painkillers should kick in soon, alright? Cash and I will go. What? Cash! We've got to swim out of here, mate. Did you miss something? There's a massive fucking crocodile in this water! Yeah. Is your phone still waterproof? Yes! OK. So we get back to the entrance, get a signal, call for help. While we're at it, we grab your gun, come back here and kill the bastard. Look, we just need to get through there and we'll be fine. Oh, we'll be fine, will be? Yeah... No! I've got my knife. That fucking croc comes for us, he's gonna get it in the head. Great. It's bloody Crocodile Dundee. You can't be serious. - He needs a hospital. - Eric. - Jen. - Don't be stupid. We're all gonna be in the water soon. Crocs are territorial. He's not gonna be happy till we're all gone. We have to try something. Mate, this is madness! I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Nup. Nuh. Fuck you. What?! Eric, you cannot get in that water. What choice do I have? W-wait! Wait! Just wait a minute! What's he saying? Cash! Alright! Yeah? Alright, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna push that out there, and when the croc grabs it, we go. You got it? That might just work. Let's do it. Aaah! Go. Whatever you do, right, don't splash. Careful. They're attracted to vibrations, OK? Slowly! Slow! Attaboy. OK. Jesus. Oh, shit. Stick together. - You good? - Yeah. Yeah. Shit. What's that? Just keep moving. Fuck! - What? - I felt something. You sure? Yes! Hang on. What are you doing? Nothing. Let's keep moving. Hey. Here you go. - Yolanda? - Yep? Uh... have you got, uh, Viktor's puffer? - He said it's in your pack. - Yep. Take some deep breaths, alright? OK? Oh... Yep. It's OK, buddy. Throw it over! Come on, Yolanda, throw it over! - He's suffocating! - Yes! Fuck! Uh... Do you have another one of those? - No! - Slow down. Hey. It's OK. It's OK. Look at me. Look at me. It's coming. OK? You're gonna be just fine. It's OK. Hey, hey, hey... It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Calm down. Calm breaths. Calm breaths. It's OK. Calm down. Yolanda, no! Slowly! Gently. Don't splash, OK? Fuck. Fuck. Yes! Aah! Do not move. Do not move a muscle. Aah! Go! Go. Go, go, go, go, go! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Here. Breathe. Breathe. Again. Breathe. Hi. It's OK. I'm here. I'm here. That hole we dropped into, it should be on the other side of this. It's a bit of a swim. Give me your phone. Hey? No point both of us drowning in that crack. If you think I'm letting you have all the glory... I'll see you on the other side. - Righto. - Yeah? Aah! - No way through. - How? It's... The water... must have moved the rocks. We've got to try to move 'em. - Let's do it. - OK. Fuck! We gotta... we gotta go back down. Mate, those rocks aren't going anywhere. We have to go back. Come on. Just give me a sec. Eric?! Fuck. Fuck... Eric? Aaagh! Aaagh! Aaaagh! Cash?! Cash! Fuck. Cash! Water's still rising. There's a breeze. Hey. It's OK. It's OK. We're gonna get out of here. - OK? - Yeah. We have to. Yes, boss. Viktor, I'm pregnant. - You're gonna be a dad. - Yeah. - I'm gonna be a dad? - I was gonna tell you... Yeah. - I was gonna tell you. - Yeah. I've just been waiting for the right time. - I'm gonna be a daddy. - Yeah. Hey? Hey, I found a passage. Look. Here. Oh, baby. Where's Cash? He, um... What? Oh, God. Oh! Oh. Oh, fuck. Well, did you find a way out of here? No, it's blocked. We can't get out that way. Hey, I think I found a passage. - What? - It's up there. Hey, Jen. Where's the Ventolin? Careful. Hey. It's pretty tight, but I think I might be able to squeeze in. - Eric? - Hey, it's alright. I'll go. We need to find a way out of here. - You OK? - Yeah. This whole place is gonna be flooded soon. We need to get Viktor out. We will. We will. Eric, I'm pregnant. Have you told Viktor? Yeah. Just now. Here. That should help take the temperature down. Oh, God. The water's really rising. Hey. Do you think you can make it up there? We've gotta move, OK? Or we're gonna go under. Yeah. I think so. - Yeah? - Yeah. OK. OK. I got you. Hang on. OK, we're there. It's OK. Aarggh! OK, that's it! Come on, buddy. Gotta get up here. Come on. You have to get up here. You can do this. Get up! Get up here! Oh! Come on. Get up! Come on! Come on! Arggh! Here. Yolanda's pregnant. I know. It's amazing. I'm so happy for you guys. We never thought we could have kids. After all the chemo, I thought I was sterile. It's incredible. Fuck! We're never gonna get out of here, are we? We will. Of course we will. What? What? You're OK. - You're OK. - Are they back? No. Yolanda's so sure of herself, isn't she? It's funny, um... Those two have always been the adventurous ones and... ..you and I, we always just wanted to sit by the pool. I used to joke with Eric that... ..maybe we should switch partners. He'd laugh. Look. The keys. Cash's pack. Here. Hold this. Hey. Wait. - Jen... - We need them to get back. Hey, wait. Wait. Jen. Jen. Hey. OK. OK. OK. Fuck! Jen! Jen, I think it's coming! Jen, get out of the water! Jen! Jen? Jen. Jen. Jen, can you hear me? Oh, shit. Shit. Jen. Aarggh! Jen. Wake up. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Viktor? Viktor! Viktor! Come on, Viktor! Oh! Jen. Huh? Jen! I'm over here. Shit. OK. Um... we're gonna have to swim. It's not far. We'll stick together, OK? Hey. Are you alright? Where's Viktor? Jen? What? He, um... Uh... you OK? You OK? Wait, did you... Did you find a way out? Did you get out? No, we can't get out that way. Fuck! Why did you bring us down here? Why did you bring us here?! Jen, just calm down. We're gonna fucking die down here! Fuck, Jen, you wanted to come. - No, I didn't! - OK, I get it! It's my fault! When were you gonna tell me? About the two of you? - Jen, come on. What the fuck? - I know, Eric. Just tell me the truth. Please just tell me the truth. It wasn't an affair. Then what was it? It was a mistake. A mistake? Is the baby yours? Oh, God. Look. Sunlight. There must be a shaft. The light's coming in through it. It's a down current. See the way the water eddies near the wall? So? So... it means the water must be getting sucked out there somewhere. Like a plughole. It could be a way out. We don't know it's a way out. We could get sucked down there and drown. Well, it's that or wait here to get eaten. We could get eaten swimming over there. Yeah? Well, I'd rather take my chances. Jen... What, Eric? You want to stay here too and wait to die? Oh, fuck! Hey. You're OK. You're OK. Just keep swimming. Keep swimming. Nice and slow. You're OK. Oh, shit. It's coming! Swim! Swim! Go! Help me! Ah! Ah! Come on, you bastard! Come on! Eric! - Go! - Eric! - Go! - No! Eric! Come back here! Eric! Eric, come back here! Eric? Arggh! Arggh! Eric! Arggh! Eric? Oh! You're OK. Eric? Oh, fuck. Come on. Come on. What the fuck is this place? Ohhh! We have to get out of here. Which way?! Look! Is that a way out? Go! Go! That's it. Come on! - OK. - Quick, quick, quick! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. This is the road we came in on, isn't it? I think so. Jen. I'm so sorry. Not now. Look out! Oh, God. Fuck. Yolanda, are you OK? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - We have to get out of here. - Oh, shit! - Come on. - Oh! Oh, my God! Come on. Oh, come on! - Can you open your door? - I can't! Come on. This is where we just came out of. Oh, my God. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, my God! The gun! The gun! Oh, my God! Get the gun! Quick, quick, quick! Get it! Did you find it? We need the clip. - Come on! - Here you go. - OK. It's OK. - OK. Where is it? - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Oh, shit! Oh, my God! No! No! Yolanda! Yolanda! Yolanda! Oh, God! - Are you OK? - My ankle! Can you swim? We gotta swim down there. Come on! Nearly there. Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Jen! Are you OK? Yeah. Come on, then. I'm sorry. I love you.
