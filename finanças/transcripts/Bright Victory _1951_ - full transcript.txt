Hey, Mac. Where's coordinate 45 and 22? 84 miles in two hours. What are you trying to do, set a new record for North Africa? Maybe he's personally trying to win the war. Well, you guys know the setup. The krauts knocked out one of our observation posts, so we gotta lay new wire to HQ. Wire. Wire. It's all I've been doing all my life, laying wire. Hey, there's the MPs. We can't be too near the shooting. Where do you think you're headed? Coordinate 45 and 22. Not today you don't. We just got orders, no vehicles beyond this point. Well, that don't include wire teams. Why not? Isn't this carrier a vehicle? Go on, turn around. Flat feet, they're all the same. It ain't only his feet are flat. Hey,. Don't you guys ever read the regulations? Here it is. Section nine, paragraph five. "All communication vehicles are exempt from restrictions on traffic." Now we got a blind battery up there screaming for wire. So what are you guys trying to do, hold up the artillery? All right, all right. You don't have to get shirty. Buddy, you'd think it was the Air Force. Go on. That road hasn't been cleared of mines yet, but go on, get your heads blown off. Where do we turn off for 13? Got a couple of men up there. They've been under 88 fire. You might not get through. That would slay me. Once a cop, always cop. I'll bet he used to give tickets to kids on bicycles. I wish I was on one right now. Going down Powell Street. Even with no brakes. I used to live on a bike back home. Nice flat country in Florida. Sometimes Chris'd go riding with me up the river to fish, but on the way home , she'd always get tired. That's nice. I like girls who gets tired of riding. This a nice girl. Sorry, Sarge. You getting marry her, Larry? Sure, I'm no fool, her old man's rich too, he owns a big plow factory. So I got no problems. A sweet, beautiful girl who's crazy about me and a soft setup for life. Just watching those barrels roll out. What more could a guy want? Oh, how do you like that? Asleep, on duty. Hey, Achtung! This is Rommel! Boy, that guy's lucky we haven't got an officer with us. Say, I hate to bother you, Mac, but... What's wrong, Larry? These guys are dead. Couldn't have been a mine. There's no hole. Snipers. Give me a hand, quick! Drive it out. Take it easy, Sergeant. Cigarette? Yeah. It's lit, just drag. Who are you? Reynolds, a medic. Where's Joe? Joe? Yeah, the guy was with me. Oh, Joe, yeah, he's okay. Say, what's this blindfold for? That's a head dressing with a sofa pack. We're taking you to a collecting station. Why can't I use my arms? You're wrapped in a blanket. You're not lying to me. They didn't cut off anything, did they? You got everything you were born with, Sergeant. You're just a little more ventilated now, that's all. Here, take another drag. Am I gonna be okay? Sure, you won by half an inch, Sergeant. How long ago was it I got hit? Just a few hours. Ah, don't give me that, I've been traveling for weeks. You were picked up near city Buzed early this morning. It's now three in the afternoon. You changed my bandage. How'd my eyes look? We can tell more after we've made an x-ray. - Is Joe here. - Who's Joe? It's Joseph Callan, my pal. First artillery. I was trying to help him when a cross sniper got me. I'll try to find out. Boys keep pouring in. I'll let you know. Where am I? The base hospital at Iran. Oh yeah? I must have drawn a blank. It's the shock, Sergeant, but you're lucky. I hear they're sending you back to the states by plane. Oh, don't kid me. When? Perhaps in a week or two. They can do a better job on you there. What kind of a job? Hold still, Sergeant. What do you mean, nurse? Say, tell me the truth, are my eyes okay? That's what we're trying to find out. And that's where they caught us in the Casserine Pass, but good. You never saw so many tanks in your life. Those big mark fours, all around us, it was murder! I didn't wanna be taken prisoner so I rolled over and played dead. But this crazy guy, Wade, from Texas, pulls out his revolver, jumps up and yells to all these German tanks. "Come on out and I won't shoot."‚Äù We getting close to New York? I've been up all listening to the radio. When do we land? I don't know. But it sure is good to hear "The Lone Ranger" again. Did the pilot say where we're landing? Yeah. Mitchell Field, Long Island. Where you from, Sarge? Florida. Seminola, little town upstate. Say, that's not far from my hometown. Atlanta. You ever been there? Sure. I played basketball there a couple of times against Georgia Tech. Great place, Atlanta. Beautiful girls. Do you know the Fairview Club? Do I know it? I used to wait tables there. Something I can do for you, Sarge? I said is there something I can do for you? Ask one of the nurses to come here. Sure. Nurse, Sergeant wants to see you. Do you want something, Sergeant? Do you mind sitting with me for a while? Of course not. We should see land in about an hour. Aren't you excited? A little. I might be more if I could see it. You will soon, just be patient. Do you have a report file on my case? Yes, why? Bring it here and read it to me. I can't do that, Sergeant, it's strictly against orders. Well, you can do it. Nobody has to know. Those files are sealed and addressed to Colonel Harris at Valley Forge Hospital. He's an absolute wizard, Sergeant. The best eye man in the country. He can do anything. You'll see. Will I? Dr. Laskey. Attention, Dr. Laskey. Please report ward D1 south. Corporal Henry Jackson, attention, Corporal Henry Jackson. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Please return to your ward. Thank you. Was that my fault, Flagg? No, that was a civilian blocking traffic. Go on, Fred. You're doing fine. Good turn, Moose. All I need is one. Say, this guy Tyler's a natural. Went around the course like a bloodhound. Didn't miss a turn. Good boy, Freddy, congratulations. I knew you'd make it. - Nothing to it. - Atta boy, Freddy. Nice going, Tyler. We've all been pulling for you. Thanks, fellas. - Flagg. - Yeah. What can I do for you, Sergeant? Have they notified my family where I am? Yeah, we sent the usual telegram yesterday when you arrived. You wanna send one home too? No, not yet. You see, we advise the men's families not to come to Valley Forge. War travel's too heavy right now. Yeah. If you'd like to speak to them on the phone, - I can arrange it. - Yeah, maybe tomorrow. Look, all I want do now, I wanna see Colonel Harris. Why, what's wrong? Well, I got a right to see him, haven't I? I'm not in here with chicken pox. He's been operating day and night. There are over 2000 men here in Valley Forge besides you, Sergeant. Oh, have a little patience. Hey, fellas. How about going in town this afternoon? We could bowl a couple games, grab a few drinks, Mac's bar, and then take in the dance at the USO. Sounds good to me. Want to join us, Freddy? No thanks, I got a brail lesson. - How about you, Vance? - Yeah. You too, Moose. Okay, you wait till I shave. Well, hurry it up. Want to catch that two o'clock bus in 20 minutes. Hiya, Moose. Hiya, Doc. Hello, boys. What's the dirt in ward one? Hi, Doc. Throw up a chair. Phew, you smell worse than usual, Doc. How many'd you carve up today? Oh, two or three dozen. I'm not through yet. My wife's having a roast duck for dinner. - Hiya, Tyler. - Hi Doc. I'm glad to see you're feeling better today, Sergeant, What you need now is a little exercise. You start walking around the ward tomorrow and pretty soon you can get outside, get some sun. It's lovely out, a nice warm summer day. I wanna see Colonel Harris. He'll get to you later, this is my job. Now turn your head this way. Gonna remove these packs from your eyes and shine in a light. This won't hurt at all. This is a test for refraction. Is a light on, Captain? Yes, Sergeant, it's on. You sure, sir? I'm certain. Turn it out. It's out now. It doesn't make any difference. There's nothing over my eyes. Nothing at all. Is the room bright? Are the windows open? They're wide open, Sergeant. - So what about the test? - The refraction? - Yeah. - It's not so good. Yeah. Yeah, but Captain, why can't I see? If it's broad daylight out there, why can't I see? Your right eye was hit with a bullet. You mean it's gone? Well, it's badly damaged. Perhaps Colonel Harris- - He can save it. - I don't know. You'll have to ask him. Yeah, but Captain, the left eye's okay. Colonel Harris can operate. Why, they told me on that plane that he was a wizard. They said he could do anything. Now that's a fact now, isn't it? Ask him tomorrow. Captain! Now you know the truth, now tell me. I can't wait till tomorrow. - Can you take it, Sergeant? - I asked you. The bullet destroyed your optic nerves. Colonel Harris. He's not God. He's not God. You mean I... You mean it's the lights out, Captain. I'll never see again. I'm afraid so, Sergeant. Hey, I'm sure getting the hang of that razor. My face feels just like a baby's! Well, pin a diaper on and let's get going. Better drink this, Sergeant, there's something in it to help you sleep. Nevins? This is Masterson. I couldn't help hearing the doctor. But we've all been through it, and this is the toughest time right now. So, get a good grip on yourself. There's a lot worse things can happen to a man. It won't look quite so black tomorrow. Thumbs up. Okay. I'm all set. How do I look? Very sharp. - Got your pants on? - Yeah. Come on, Vance. - You with us, John? - I'm coming. How much money you got, Moose? Oh, I'm loaded, I got plenty. Yeah, thumbs up. Carry on. Carry a little tin cup, Nevins. Get yourself some pencils. Here's a penny for it. You'll never see again, never. Not your father's face. Not your mother's face. Not Chris. You couldn't be any worse off if you're dead. "Cause you're blind. You're blind, blind, blind. What you trying to do, man? Stop, don't be crazy. Gimme that blade! Drop it, drop it! Let me go. You got the wrong slant, Sergeant. You got a lot to live for. Like what? We'll show you, that's our job. But you gotta help us. Let me go, let me go, let me go. Nevertheless, the economic necessity to maintain a high ratio of income in the face of a depreciating world market and the astronomical cost of supporting the war must obviously be born by the business man. We came out, went down the left drive to the front gate, right here, went up the right drive, which led to the chapel, which is right there. That's the layout, Nevins. Hospital, grounds, everything, exactly the way it is. Now you've gotta memorize it until you can go anywhere in the place, up and down, in and out by yourself. Memorize all this meat? Not in a million years. No, in three weeks. After you learn to get around, we'll teach you how to shave, eat, take care of your clothes, ride a bus, read braille. It's no use, Flagg. I'll never make it, I can't concentrate. You'll make it. Then after six weeks you get a travel test. If you pass it, you get a month's furlough. Then we send you to Old Farms Convalescent Hospital at Avon, Connecticut for the postgraduate course. That's where they do the real job on you. They teach you to live and work like anybody else. Okay, let's go. It's all hard work, Nevins, and it's all uphill, but it pays off with a future. Stop talking like a recruitment sergeant. This Army's done enough for me already. They don't think so. Now hold your arm straight out in front, parallel to the ground. That's good. Bend your forearm across your chest. Oh no, no, not so low. That's better. Extend and relax your fingers. That protects the far side of your body. Your arm protects your face. Now, can you go back to the door we came through? Sure, I'll follow the edge of the wall. All right, try it. Keep your arm up. That's swell. That's as good a first try as I've ever seen. - I'm lost. - You're never lost. Put out your left hand and feel. Huh? Here's your fork, Larry. Right? All right, now your meat's at 12 o'clock. The corns at three, potatoes are at eight, all right? Bread's on your left over here. Now put the fork down here, that's it. Milk's up here on your right. All right? Cut your meat for you. A little steak for chow, huh? Yeah, swell. Now you hold it well up in the crook, like that, the crook held out. That protects your knuckles from sharp edges and hot pipes. You hold it 15 inches in front of you, across your body, the tip two inches off the floor. Okay, now let's try it. Step up. Don't use it as a feeler. Cane's not a feeler, it's a bumper. You know, like a car. What'll I do with my license, wear it around my neck? Come on let's try it again. Is that you, Pete? - Yeah. - How was your date? Terrific. But terrific. Well, come on, give, Pete. Where'd you go, Mac's bar? We started there. Then... She took me up to her place. Her place? No kidding. So help me. And we sat down on a sofa, had another drink, turned on the radio kinda soft and low. Yeah. We're right there with you, Petey boy. So then? Then we talked a while, this and that, you know, the usual stuff. Sure, sure, taking your time, huh Petey? That was smart. Some guys tried to grab "em right off the bat. So then what? Then we had another drink. Then I held her hand, you know, casual-like. Yeah. Was it warm? Like a $2 pistol. So was I. So then you kissed her, I hope. No, no. She kissed me. No kidding! How was it, Pete? Sorta soft and... With a nice bourbon float. So she kissed you, okay. Then what? I kissed her. Yeah, yeah. So? So I put my arms around her. Then she reached up and turned off the light. Well go on, go on. Then? Yeah, that did it. That finished me. Finished you, are you crazy? What do you mean? All she could see in the dark was my wrist watch. I didn't know it had a radium dial. "Pete, honey," she says, "you gotta go. You only got six minutes to catch the last bus." - No, no, no, no! - No! Yep. Most of you men lost your sight in combat, and with some, the shock hasn't fully worn off. But until these neuroses of panic and despair have been conquered, you will not begin the healthy adjustment which will eventually bring you peace with yourselves and with others. Now, some bitterness is natural. You men have lost a source of great physical satisfaction and convenience in life. But many of your friends lost more than that. You at least are alive. How much alive now depends on you. Yesterday, you could see. Today, you cannot, but tomorrow or someday soon, if you apply yourselves, you'll discover that every part of you is working hard to replace your eyes, and you'll be astonished at your success. This is one of the greatest miracles the human body can accomplish. Remember that. Never doubt it for a second. That's all for today. - Any questions? - Yes, sir. What about our pensions? You'll get $190 a month for life. So it's not too bad, is it? No. It's very sweet of them, sir. - Nevins. - Yeah. Lieutenant Atkins would like to see you in his office, this way. That's correct. Yes, yes, I'll be at this number. Here's Sergeant Nevins, sir. Oh, yes. Please sit down, Sergeant. Thank you, Greg. - That's all. - Yes, sir. Care for a cigarette? No thank you, sir. How's everything going, Nevins? Any complaints? No sir. Well, I have one. Why haven't you answered any of the letters and telephone calls from your family? I figured that was my business, sir. Not altogether. It's our job to straighten you men out. Also not to hide anything from your families. But we give you the chance to break it to them first. Why haven't you? Well, I don't know, sir. I'm just not ready for it yet. I don't agree. In four weeks, you'll be going home on furlough. Your parents need that time to adjust themselves before you arrive. So do you. Yes? Hold the line a moment. I put a call through to Florida to your mother. She's on the line now. Do you want to tell yourself or shall? It's up to you. Mrs. Nevins, this is Lieutenant Atkins at Valley Forge Hospital. I thought you might apprec... Mother. Larry! Oh Lawrence? Lawrence! It's Larry on the phone. Oh, Larry, boy, it's just wonderful to hear your voice again. We want to come and see you, your father and I, and Chris. Tell me, Larry boy, how are you? I'm fine, Mother. Yeah, just fine. Were you badly hurt, son? Oh no, no, it wasn't... Tell her, tell her now or I will. Mother. It's just one little thing. I'm blind. Did you hear me, Mother? I said I was blind. I can't now, I'll call you later. Okay, Lieutenant, does that satisfy you? Nevins, I'm sorry about this. I know how you feel. You know how I feel? I'm as blind as you are. I'm sorry, sir. Okay, this is Mac's bar. They'll treat you square. Let's see if you have enough money. Fives, ones, change. Okay, I'll be back for you in an hour. Don't get loaded. Why not? Would you like to sit at the bar? Thank you. Hello, soldier, what's your pleasure? - Rye, ward on the side. - Right. Do you mind if I borrow this popcorn? Sergeant, if you're all alone, would you like to come over to our table? - No, thank you. - Oh, come on. We're having lots of fun, we'll cheer you up. I said no thank you, isn't that plain enough? Yes, I'm sorry. Hey, this is Judy Green, Sergeant. She's been awfully nice to a lot of the boys. Ah, I bet. You made a mistake, soldier. That's a nice girl. She wasn't trying to pick you up. Who asked you? Hey, we cleaned up Sicily. And landing at Sileno. McCarthy moved onto New Guinea. And that English actor, Leslie Howard, he was Killed in a plane, shot down the Bay of Bisque. Want any more? Baseball scores, Dick Tracy... Advice to the lovelorn, you name it. What's the date, Flagg? Tuesday, September the fifth, 1943. Only a couple of more weeks now you'll be heading south on furlough, huh? I don't want to go home, Flagg. Why can't I stay here? Go on up to Avon. Because it's Army orders. You know, going home's a big part of the treatment. You've only got two more tests. You got obstacle perception today and a travel test next week. What's this obstacle perception? How's it work? Well, nobody knows for sure. It's a peculiar ability of a few blind people to sense solid objects in front of them. The handball court's over here in our left. Watch the curb. That's it. Captain Fala and Lieutenant Calkin are waiting for you. They'll tell you what you're to do. I want you to stand here, Sergeant. Now walk very slowly forward until you reach the wall. Not bad. Now walk back here toward my voice. Good. Now I'm gonna turn you around. Now try it. What's the matter? You only traveled half the distance. You want me to bump my brains out? You're smart, Sergeant. You knew we headed you in another direction, didn't you? You were taking no chances. All right. All right, now, try it again. Now what's the matter? You can do better than that. I'm afraid I can't, sir. There's a wall just in front of me. What makes you think that, Sergeant? When I get close to it, I can feel the wall. Something tells me it's there. How did it feel? Well, it's almost like a change in the currents of the air. Well, it's like when you wet your finger and hold it up in the wind, only this time, the feeling comes against my face. That's fine. Now, once more. This time, stop as close to the wall as you can. All right. Six inches. Ah, it's a new record. Well how'd I do it? What happened? Oh, nobody knows yet for sure. We think it's a sort of supersonic radar. Sound waves bounce back to you from objects, but only a few can feel them as acutely as you do. You're one of the lucky ones, Sergeant. Let's go, Larry. Yeah. Yeah, Mother, it's almost as if I can see with my face, only it really comes through my ears. You see, sound waves bounce back and warn you. They say it's the same kind of thing as lets bats fly safely in the dark. Oh, lad, I don't understand what you mean, but I'm so happy for you. Let me try to tell Dad. Maybe he can explain it to you. He wants talk to you, Dad. Hi Larry. Yeah, sure. What is it, go ahead. It's a mysterious thing, Dad, but the principal's the same as radar. Now doctors here tell me that everybody has it, but people with sight never use it. Well, that makes sense, son. Then half the time we don't even use our eyes. Well, I'll be seeing you in a few weeks, Dad. Seeing you, that's a joke with us up here, but you know what I mean. Yes, I know. What'll I tell Chris for you? Give her my love, Dad. I'll do that. Goodbye. So long, Larry. Attention, Sergeant George Spurling, please report to the demo clinic immediately. Sergeant George Spurling. I'm sorry. Here, here's your cane. Did I hurt you? You nearly knocked my teeth out. You were way over to the left. I know, it's my fault. I was on the wrong side and going too fast. Had a good bump coming to me. If you can't locate it, it's on my head. Say, I'm Larry Nevins. You sound like a southerner. New Orleans. I'm Joe Morgan. What's your outfit, Joe? The 226 machine gun. Yours? First artillery. Where'd you catch it? Antwerp. A booby trap killed eight and blinded four of us. Come on over the PX let me buy you a drink. For that bump. Okay, Joe? Okay, Larry. But the next bump's on me. Say, you know, I had a pal in North Africa named Joe. I never did find out what happened to him. Well maybe, I'll run across him one of these days. Blast you! I'll race you back, I'll race you back. We're Army! Hey, what's the score on the first ball? Hey, what's the score, what's the score? Here it is, Masterson and Tyler 86, Hamilton and Garvy 92, Morgan and Nevins, 94! Hey fellas, sounds like the joint's jumping, eh? Yeah, with hep cats. Hi fellas, how about a nice cold drink? What's nice about it, Miss, besides the ice? - Tea with lemon. - Thanks. - There you are. - Thank you. Thank you. Mm, I've forgotten how nice girls smelled. How would you know a nice girl, Sergeant? - Ooh. - Ooh. Oh, Larry, you better be careful. You've been outta circulation too long. Hey, what'd I get, how much? How do I know? Boy, you must have hit the jackpot. Well, go get somebody to tell us the score. Well, you've got 12,750, Sergeant. No kidding! I couldn't get a score like that when I could see. Would you like to dance with me? - Sure. - Sure. You'll have to touch us, Miss. We don't know which one you mean. All right, you're next. Oh, it's been so long. I don't know if I can remember how. Well, let's try, shall we? Hey, you fellas wait right here. I'll be back in a minute. Cut it up for me, Larry. Give a nickel, somebody, hurry up. We've met before, haven't we? Yes. Before tonight, I mean. Yes. What's your name? Judy Green. Mine's Larry Nevins. What color's your hair, Judy? Oh, sort of light brown. I thought so. Blondes are different. You have a nice figure, Judy. Thank you, Sergeant. There's a step. - Let's sit down, shall we? - Yeah. Step. This has been fun, Judy. This is the first fun I've had in a long time. I'm glad. Say, tell me something. The first time you saw me at that bar, did you know I was blind? Is that why you tried to be nice to me? No, Larry, you just looked lonely, that's all. Nobody told me, but I think you're beautiful. I'm not really. What difference does it make if I think you are? Do you have a boyfriend, Judy? No. Then everybody around here must been blind. You Southern boys hand out quite a line, don't you? Oh, we grow on you. But it takes time. And if you're like most of the other boys, you probably have a girl waiting for you at home. Yeah. Three years. But waiting for what? She's probably scared as I am. Not if she loves you, Larry. Not if you love her. I do, Judy. I really do. We have a lot of happy memories behind us. I don't know what lies ahead, but she says she needs me, and she says it doesn't make any difference if I can't see. Of course it doesn't make any difference. You said you work, Judy. Where? In a bank here in town. You live here with your family? No, both my parents are dead, but I have a married sister who lives in Philadelphia. She and Bill have a cabin near here. They come out for the weekends. We have lots of fun together, fishing and fooling around. Yeah. We used to go fishing a lot back home in Florida, Chris and I. - Chris is your girl? - Yeah. Do you have a picture of her? Nope, only in my mind. So she'll never grow old. Yeah, that's true, isn't it? I never thought of that. So you're a very wise girl, Judy. Here comes your bus. Judy, I'm sorry about the other night at the bar. I behaved like a heel, didn't I? Yes, you did. When am I gonna see you again? Well, I don't know. When do you want to? Well, what about Saturday? I'll get a pass. All right, where'll I meet you? What about the Uso around 8:30? Hey, driver, what are we waiting for? Nevins is saying good night to his girl. Don't rush him, pal. Well, what do you know. And I was thinking he was lost. Why, you old Southern wolf. Go on and kiss him and let's get going. Good night, Larry. Good night, Judy. - Well, did she? - And how. Why Nevins, you old lover boy! I coulda stayed out later. Instead I had to drag you home. "Stay right here, fellas," the man says. "I'll be back in a minute," the man says. Oh, you're jealous. You're just dying to know what happened. Wipe that lipstick off and tell me. Hey, I'll ask her if she's got a girlfriend, Joe. We'll go out and have some fun, huh? You're forgetting my furlough starts day after tomorrow. I'll be home in New Orleans by Saturday. Oh, that's right. Gee, I'm sure gonna miss you, Joe. It's only a month. We'll have lots of time together up at Avon. Hey, Larry. Billy told me there'll be some new men coming in here tomorrow. Yeah, so I hear, and three of 'em are niggers. I never knew they let niggers in this ward. Did you, Joe? Yeah. I've been here nearly seven months now. Maybe he thought you were colored too. Now that should do it. Just about there. How far is it? Oh, about 15 feet. This is the hole. How's my aim, is it about right? A little to the left. Yes, that's it. Hey, what do you think of that? That was wonderful. I really had that one lined up. You really did. Now let's play for the last hole. Come on, I'll buy you another drink. All right. - Hey Mac, couple more beers. - Coming up. Pass that popcorn, Sarge? Here you are, Sergeant. That was pretty straight. Why'd you stop here? 'Cause I'm in front of the bank. I'm very close to it. Is that right? Close enough. Now go in and sign that check, cash it, and come out. Mr. McIntosh will take care of you at the end. Thank you. Oh, excuse me. - Morning, Sergeant. - Morning. How would you like the money? Nine ones and some silver, please. There you are, $10. Thank you. Hey, wait a minute. You short-changed me. This nickel ought to be a quarter. Sorry, my mistake. You're pretty sharp today. Yeah, I have to be with you guys setting traps for me. Good work, Larry. How's the test going? Oh, hi, Judy. I don't know, you have to ask my bloodhound. It's not bad, not bad. The toughest part's still ahead of him. Let's go. Relax now. Don't be nervous. You can do it. Just watch out for the corners and don't trip. Oh, look, no coaching, it's against the rules, - you know that. - I'm sorry. Did you get your pass? - Yeah, it's all set. - Let's go. When'll you pick me up? - Saturday at noon. - Okay, Judy, I'll be ready. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. See ya. And watch out of those fire hydrants. Oh, please. Thank you. So far so good. Now go to the Southeast corner of Fourth and Gay. It seems a hundred years instead of three, and everyone on the ranch is anxious to have you home again, but Billy and I can't wait that long and we're leaving Santa Fe tonight. Our train will arrive in Philadelphia Saturday morning, and we'll come straight out to the hospital. So till then, a big hug from both of us and all our love. Your Charlotte. Thank you, Terry. Your wife and son are coming all the way from New Mexico. Isn't that wonderful news, John? Yeah. Billy was born when I was overseas. I've never seen him. Now I never will. Now it's your turn, Pete. Say, you should have seen this Nevins boy go through that town. Later we stopped on the route like a milk truck course. He didn't miss a trick. Say, what's wrong with those guys, Larry? You have a quarrel? No. Haven't spoken to me since Joe Morgan left. Yeah. I heard about that. Bunch of dopes. You'd think I'd have killed somebody. You did. You killed your best friend. What did you expect me to say, that I was sorry? Joe should have told me what he was when I met him, then he wouldn't have gotten hurt. And he never would've been your friend, either. Would he? You're gonna run into this sort of thing for the rest of your life, Larry. People with no faces, no color, just voices. You gonna ask them what their race or religion is before you decide whether you like 'em or not? Or learn to trust what you feel about 'em? Think it over. Bus is coming over here, Sergeant, to your left. Daddy. Bill? Hi, Daddy. What's the matter? Why did everybody stop talking? We're just watching some people from the bus, Sergeant. Hi, soldier, how about taking a ride? Why sure, who is it? Who is it? So you'd go with just any girl, eh? Oh, it's you, Judy. Why, I thought for a minute it was that red-headed nurse from ward nine. Oh, I feel like a kid just let out school, Judy. Passed all my tests and got promoted to Avon. Ain't it smart? Head of the class. Now you'll be going home. Yeah, Monday, two more days. I'll bet you're happy about it. Yeah, but in one way, I hate to leave Valley Forge. People are used to us here. They understand us. Especially you, Judy. You've been mighty good to me and I'm gonna miss you. Oh, you'll find lots else to think about at home. Old friends. We're almost there. It's just the other side of this old covered bridge. Hi Judy! Be down in a minute. Hello, Bill! Hi, kids. - Hello, Janet. - Welcome to Poison Oak. Janet, this is Larry Nevins. Hello, Janet. Hello, Larry. Well, let's get out of this hot uniform and cool it off. How about a swim? Well, that sounds great, but I didn't bring any trunks. Oh, well don't mind that. Half the time we don't wear anything. Janet. Oh, she's so proper at times. But later on, I'll tell you some stories. I'd love to hear 'em. Don't you believe a word of it, Larry. She makes a pitch at all the boys. - Hello, kids. - Hello. Hello, beautiful. Sometimes I think I married the wrong sister. I just couldn't wait for you to grow up. Larry, this is my brother-in-law, Bill Grayson. - Hello Bill. - Hello, Larry. Judy says you're quite a fisherman. Well, I used to be. What do you mean used to be? Nobody ever got cured of that. Oh no? You cured me, buster. Larry, he fishes just like a Philadelphia lawyer. Whenever they're not biting, he wants to sue the Bureau of Hatcheries for cause. Don't you believe it, Larry. Come on, I'll show you where you change. You ever spent the weekend before with two women? Oh brother, it's murder. Clackity clackity, yada yada, scare the fish, talk, talk, talk, all the time. - You listening? - Yeah... Last week I caught a two-pound trout over by a big rock there. See if you can't put one over there. I'm afraid I can't see quite that far, Bill. Oh. Sorry, Larry, I keep forgetting. Doing okay now. Put out a little more line. What are you planning to do when you get outta the Army, Larry? Well, I think maybe I got a pretty good setup waiting for me at home. Oh, doing what? I don't know yet. It's in a barrel factory. Doesn't sound like a very good job for you, Larry. Did you ever think about studying law? Whoever heard of a blind lawyer? Wait a minute, you're all snarled up. Here, I'll straighten it out for you. There's a guy I know in Philadelphia you oughta meet. His name is Jess Coe. Got a fine practice. Very successful. Lost his eye in the first war, piece of shrapnel. Never guess it to see him in a courtroom. Boy, he gets around like a regular whiz. Doesn't miss a trick. Why, I'll bet I've lost six big cases to him, and I'm no legal dummy either. You mean he does trial work before juries? Well, sure. That's where he really shines. Why, he's got a mind like a steel trap. You can't fool him on anything. Here's the bank. Never asked any favors, nobody ever gives him any, but he wins much more often than he loses. I know I can't beat him. Hey, he's one man in a thousand, Bill. I'm not that bright. Maybe so. But it must have been dark when he started too. Okay, here's your line. How much do you like him, Judy? Quite a bit. I don't know why I asked, it's written all over your face. ‚ô™ In a canyon, in a cavern ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Excavating for a mine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Lived a miner 49 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And his darling Clementine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh my darling, oh my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh my darling, Clementine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You are gone and lost forever ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Dreadful sorry, Clementine ‚ô™ Oh, what a quartet. Larry, we've been needing a good baritone like yours for years. All those other guys Judy's brought up here have been either tone deaf or tenors. And who was that beautiful lieutenant who sang "Trees?" Wanted to go out and cut down every pine on the place. Every pine. You talk too much, buster. Put your little ax away and come on, it's bedtime. Oh, but honey, the night is young. I know, but you are not. Come on, you can have the bathroom first. But I don't wanna go to bed yet. I wanna stay here and talk with Larry. We barely scratched the surface. I'll scratch yours if you don't come on, give her a break. Oh, why didn't somebody tell me? What do you want, a neon sign? Come on. Oh, Larry, your bed's over there by the door, all made up. - Thanks. - Goodnight, kids. - Good night, Janet. - Good night, Janet. - Night, Bill. - Good night. See you in the morning. Good night, Larry. Night, Judy. Oh, they're great pair. I like your family, Judy. You know, I sat here tonight amazed. Listened to myself laughing and singing and acting just like a normal person. A month ago, I was anything else. And you did it, Judy. You're the doctor that cured me. I still can't figure out how I was so lucky with all the other fellas you could have picked out. Oh, I can pick 'em. I never miss. Then why haven't you found a good one for yourself? You got so much to offer a man, Judy. Haven't you ever been in love? Yes, once. Well, what happened? There was another girl. So you gave him up? - Yes. - Why? He just couldn't see me, that's all. Are you still in love with him? Yes. That's not so good. I know. Ah, there'd be somebody else. Would you write to me now and then, Judy? Let me know how things are going. Hmm? But why not? We're good friends, aren't we? I'll write you, or get somebody else to. Please do, Larry. - And send me a picture. - Sure I will. And you can give me a picture right now. This way I'll always remember you. Judy, you're crying. What's the matter? Oh no, you can't be. I know that, but I am. Judy, you're all mixed up, it isn't me, it's this. No, no, no, it isn't pity, Larry. I know that down deep inside. I didn't want to tell you. I never meant to. I tried to stop it. Believe me. But whenever I saw you, whenever you touched me, there it was. Oh, Judy, Judy. I don't know what to say. I don't... Listen, Judy, I'm only human. I've gotta be honest with you. I still love Chris and I'm going back to her. Well sure, maybe if I'd met you before. But don't you see, with Chris I know now. With Chris, my whole life is all planned out for me with nothing to fear. That's the security I need now more than anything else. Yes, Larry. Security. I could never give you that. Judy. That wasn't easy to say. - What time's the train due? - 11:20. Did you call the station? Is it on time? Yes, dear. Will you please throw that cigar away? Why? Because I'm nervous. I can't understand how you can be so calm. I'm not, but this helps. Now Lawrence, they said we should treat Larry just as if nothing were different. We mustn't let him know how- - For heaven's sakes, Claire, I read the letter. It's a regular army form, sent out to all the families of blinded men. And don't ever use that word. Yes, dear. Now don't be long, we mustn't be late. Yes, dear. May I take your hat, sir? No thank you, I'll be coming right out. They're all in the living room. And dear you've, no id... Good morning, Mrs. Patterson. How are you, Edward? Well, Chris, are you ready to go? Lawrence, I want to have a talk with you. But Larry's train is due in. Well, that's what I wanna talk about. You know, we're going to be faced with a mighty big problem from now on. I mean about Chris and Larry. Yes, his mother and I have talked about it too, but it seems to us it should be up to them. Well, I'm sorry, Lawrence, I'm afraid I have to disagree with that. Normally I'd never interfere with Chris's decisions. This is not a normal situation. So let's face this honestly, right now, before they meet each other and it gets out of hand. Now, may I say something? Or is it already decided? Oh, please dear, you mustn't be rude. What should I do? Stand here with my mouth shut? Just because my family doesn't want a blind son-in-law. Oh Chris, that's not fair. Larry is a fine boy. But not fine enough for me. Oh, I'm a great catch, Mr. Nevins. I'm the great golden prize. You didn't know that, did you? Larry never told you. Maybe nobody ever told him, but I am. And now of course, now that he's blind, well, it's just completely outta the question. Nobody cares how I feel. And how do you feel about him, Chris? Remember, you haven't seen him yet. I love Larry, Mr. Nevins. And if he wants me, I'll marry him tomorrow. Well, I've got to be going. Chris, it might be better now if you didn't come with us to the station. You'll see Larry tonight. Or does this change the plans for the party? Well, no, no, of course not. I'll make some excuse to him. Well, thank you, Mr. Nevins. What on Earth kept you so long? And where's Chris? - She isn't coming. - Why not? She thought it might be best if we met him alone. Larry'll be expecting her at the station. She's a very thoughtful girl, Claire. We should be grateful to her. Watch your step, son. - Oh, Larry! - Mother! - Who's with you? - Your father. Hello, Dad. Oh my. Well, where's Chris? She didn't come with us, son. We tried to bring her, but she thought it best for us to see you first alone. Wasn't that sweet of her? All right, well how is she? Oh, she's fine, just fine. And prettier than ever, son. She's giving a big party for you tonight, a real homecoming. Oh, Lawrence, get his baggage, I'll take him to the car. Aboard! We still have the same old car, son, but we haven't used it much during the war. Your father's on the ration board, and he could get extra coupons, but you know how he is. Once he makes up his mind about something, there's no use arguing. And son, I made the biggest batch of biscuits for you. And everybody's so anxious to see you, Larry boy. All your friends have been stopping us on the street and calling the house. We're on River Street now, near the park. Well, yes, we are. I know it by the smell. Gee, I wish I had a nickel for every time I was swimming in there. So how's the fishing been, Dad? Oh, I haven't gone since you left, son. No, we haven't had time for any kind of pleasure at all. I never get up to Jacksonville and your father has to help me round the house on weekends. We just seem to be tied down all the time. Well, what about Ella Mae? Is she still working for us? Oh, didn't I write and tell you about her? No. Well, she just up and gave notice one day, after nine years, after all we'd done for her. I taught her everything, gave her my old clothes, paid her doctor bill. Yes, but mother, where did she go and why? Well, it wasn't the Ella Mae's idea, not at first, anyway, but the word got around Seminola that the war plants up north were hiring Negroes at big, fancy wages. We just couldn't hold them back, that's all. So Ella Mae has been in Detroit now for more than a year. Oh, when this thing's over, she'll find out. She'll find out what? Where she belongs, of course, and where she was happy. Oh Larry, you just don't know what the war's done to our Negroes. I know what it did to one of them. Our Negroes, why do you still talk that way, Mother? The Civil War's over, haven't you heard? Larry, what do you mean? - Hello, Larry. - Welcome home, Larry. Who's that? The neighbors. Now, isn't that sweet of them. They've come to see you, Larry boy. Sit right where you are, old man. Mother, get out. Lawrence Nevins, are you out of your mind? Your boy's come home and people are waiting. I said get out and be quick about it. Larry and I are driving downtown to have some whiskey and we're going to chase it with some beer. Mighty fine to see you back home again, Larry. Sure missed you, boy. Thanks, Todd, it's good to be here. Here's looking at you, Dad. Happy days, son. You have one, Dad? Oh, sure, thanks. I'm glad you brought me here, Dad. I wasn't quite ready to meet people yet. Maybe a drink will settle me down. Sure it will, son, we'll have another. There's no hurry. Dad. I'm sorry I hurt mother's feelings, but I couldn't help it. My best friend at Valley Forge was a Negro, Joe Morgan. I didn't even know he was Black until one night, I said something to him that tore us wide apart. When Mother talked about Ella Mae, it reminded me how she never let me play with Negroes when I was a kid, and how she taught me to think about 'em. That's why I blew up at her. She taught you those things because she was taught them, son. And I was too. The whole world's changing, and you more than we because you helped to change it. Well, there's one thing'll never change, Dad, and that's you. Are you sure about me? Ah, certain. You think now, but we ever talked like this before? Had drinks together in a bar? No, I guess we haven't. Then I have changed. You're right, Dad, that makes it 100%. Well, even Mother isn't the same. I don't know what I expected, but- - Your mother hasn't changed, Larry. She loves you more than anything in this world. Well, she talked about everything but... I don't know. She didn't seem very happy to see me. Neither was I. Did you expect us to be? Well, I thought- - That we'd be overjoyed to see you coming home blinded, Larry? The only child we have? You don't give much credit to your mother and me. It's tough for you, son, tougher than anything can be. But it's hit us hard too. Your mother and me and Chris, all the folks that love you, and your mother's been under a terrible strain. She's had to be brave with all the neighbors watching. Had to be brave for a long, long time. She did her crying and private when you went off to war. Now she's talking fast to cover up the tears that choke her. I'm sorry, Dad. I should have known. Let's go home. Goodbye, Todd. So long, Larry. Thanks Todd. I smell biscuits. And country ham. Mother. That couldn't be a lemon pie, could it? My baby. Oh. Larry boy. Oh, Larry, Larry. Larry. Come on, darling. - Welcome home, Larry. - Welcome home, Larry. Nice to see you, Larry, you look great. You remember Ray Whitehead, Larry? He was in our class in high school. Oh sure, we played football together. Well, Ray's a first lieutenant now, and we're engaged. Thanks, I only need one. Well good for, Ray. Where is he? He's recruiting wax in New Orleans. Well, that's even better. Larry, how much longer do you think the war's gonna last? I'm so afraid something might happen to Ray. Well, I don't know Elena, but I got a hunch Ray's gonna be okay. Larry, we must have a good long talk soon. Just you and I alone. I want to hear exactly how it happened and what the doctors have told you. There might still be some hope, you know. Miracles have happened before. - I don't believe in miracles. - Dr. Bannerman, I never did. Oh Larry, I'm very sorry. That was all my fault. Larry, can I help you? We can just take a minute, we'll get- - Just take it easy, Larry. Are you all right, Larry, darling? It's all right, we'll clean it up. I could use a good stiff drink. Well, come on, then. You'll excuse us. Step. Step. Well, Larry. I can't get over how well you look, my boy. Nobody'd ever dream he'd been laid up in the hospital, would they, Chris? I'm glad you think so, Mr. Patterson. Daddy, I'm taking Larry in for a drink. Good, give him some of that pre-war bourbon, sweetheart. - The 17-year-old. - Thank you, sir. Remember this window seat, Chris? Yes. You had a party on your 17th birthday. 16th. Yeah, okay, 16th. And we left the other kids and we came in here. I forget what excuse we gave. We were looking for a pencil. That's right. At least that's what we said. - Here's your drink. - Oh, thanks. What about you? I have one, and how I need it. Yeah, me too. Were you worried about seeing me, Chris? - Yes, a little. - Yeah. I was too. This isn't quite the way we planned it, is it? No, not exactly. Look, Chris. I know we both been thinking about us, but don't let's talk about it yet. Three years is a long time, and you have to get used to me all over again. Well, you would anyway, but especially now. We have a month together, so don't let's hurry. We won't, Larry. The important thing is that you're home again, and we're together. Don't tell me, Chris, show me. You're a big girl now. It certainly was a lovely party tonight, don't you think so, Larry? I'll bet the Pattersons just used up thousands of food points. Maybe I'd better send 'em some of ours, don't you think so, Lawrence? Well, yes we should, dear, but I really don't think they'll starve. Did you have a nice time, son? Well, there were one or two bad moments. I was never quite sure who was talking to me, but yes, Mother, it was a good feeling being with old friends again. There's no place like home, is there, Larry boy? It must have been mighty lonesome for you up north with all those strangers. Oh, I had a few friends, Mother. You forget it's a big army, dear. No, no, Dad. I mean other friends in Phoenixville. They were used to us fellas up there, and some of 'em were wonderful to us. There was one in particular. Can you follow it, darling? Well, pretty well, but I'm a little confused right now. Now which girl's this one? Well, this is Anne Marie, the girl he was in love with before he was married, only he didn't realize it then, and now she comes back and she's married too, so they- - Please do you have to explain? Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. Please excuse us. Well, of all the- - Relax, honey, she didn't know. Let's get out here, Larry, I'm mad enough to spit. No, no, no wait a minute. I didn't come here to see the picture anyway. Turn this way a minute. Now, really. Haven't they got a home to go to? Not yet, ma'am, but we're working on it. We came here the night you graduated from high school. You wore a beautiful white dress and you had a little green ribbon in your hair and you caught the devil 'cause you got home so late the. The things you remember, Larry. Well, why shouldn't I? That's all I've got to think about. That's probably full of red bugs, Larry. I don't care. Someday I'm gonna get a dog to lead me through the woods and help me find quail. I'll come out here in the winter and hunt, shooting at sound. Maybe I won't hit anything, but I'll still be hunting for quail. Now I'm not gonna let you fool around with guns, Larry. Why do you wanna do what you can't do? Because I don't know that yet, Chris. Well, Larry, Chris tells me everything I settled. You're to be married right after Christmas - when you get back. - Yes, sir. That'll make everybody in town very, very happy. Well, including Chris and me I hope, sir. Why, of course, of course it will. That's why I want to have a little talk with you. Have you thought of trying to do anything - after you're married? - Yes, sir. I wanna work. Well, maybe we can find a job of some sort for you right here in our plant. Course, it'll be some time before you can make yourself useful, but the work will be easy, we wouldn't expect too much from you at first. Well, what sort of work would it be, sir? Well, I don't know. We'd have to try you out, make some experiments. Well, that's very generous of you, Mr. Patterson, but- - No, Larry, don't misunderstand me. Frankly, I'm only doing this for Chris. You mean you don't think I could ever pay for my keep. Well, let's face it, Larry. You're no longer an able-bodied man. It's very pitiable, but it's true. Did Chris ask you to do this for me, sir? Well, yes, we've talked it over. I want her to be happy, and I know you do too. Of course, Chris will have her own income after she's married, and when I'm gone, she'll come into quite a bit more. So when you're back home for good, the job will be right here waiting for you. Oh, Eddie. Yes, sir. - Will you see Mr. - Nevins to my car, please? That'll give you something to think about, won't it? Yeah. Yeah. Watch your step. But you're unfair if you think. Daddy did it because he's sorry for you. I know he's not, Chris. He's sorry for you. That's the plain truth and that's why I gotta get away from here. I have to stand on my own feet, get my own job because I deserve it. One pension's enough, Chris. That's being cruel, Larry. I can't help it, Chris. Don't you see that any job I get here'd be given me outta charity? But where I'm not known, I could get a chance- - Oh Larry, I don't wanna leave Seminola. Everything I know and love is here. Darling, please try to be reasonable about this. Isn't it gonna be hard enough for us without deliberately making it worse? It'd be very hard, Chris. For years, maybe always. You'd have to lead me around. You'd have to cut up my food, comb my hair, do all the things I can't do for myself. But I'd make it up to you. I'd work hard and I'd be somebody you'd be proud of. And I can, I know it. You've just got to have little faith in me, that's all. You know, Chris, I'll be leaving for Avon in a few days, and I'd like to know how we stand before I go. Don't try to decide this right now, but I'll be at home tonight. So could you come by and tell me? Will you? Yes, Larry. Think very carefully, Chris. This is for all our lives. Larry. Yes, Chris. I've tried. I've tried so hard, Larry. I'm just not strong enough. I can't. Will you ever forgive me? Oh sure, Chris. It was an awful lot to ask. Oh, darling. All the things we hoped for. So many years. I know. - Coming to bed, son? - Oh yes, Dad. Left a glass milk on your table, son. - Thanks, Mom. - Good night, dear. Good night. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, son. Larry. Is anything wrong? No, Mother. Everything's all right. - Hello, Larry. - Is that you, Bill? Yes. Here, let me take your bag. Could you make the date for me? Yeah, we're all set. We're going there now. There's an hour and a half before your train leaves. All right, step. Okay. Here we are. And of course, if I knew you better, it might be easier to advise you. But Bill has told me a little and you sound quite serious about it. I am, Mr. Coe. Well, that's the important thing. You know, the law is a hard master, and when you think you've learned it all, you've only just begun. You must never stop learning all your life, and that requires constant study. But law books aren't printed in braille, so someone has to read them aloud to you. And that's why I asked Bill to bring you here to the house, so you could meet my wife. She's been doing that for years. She helps me with all my work and often sits with me in court. I think she knows more law than I do. She's lots prettier, too. So they tell me. We need someone like this, Nevins. They become both our heart and our eyes. Some of us manage to make the grade alone, but it's 10 times as hard. How was it at law school? Did you have any trouble keeping up with the others? They make no concessions to us. It's a long, uphill pull all the way. There'll be many times when you feel despondent and ready to quit. And then one day, like that, you find yourself. It's when you discover that you can concentrate better than the others. That's the one big light in our darkness. That, and someone to love. With those two, there's nothing you can't do. Bill, hadn't we better get to the station? Yes, Larry. I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Coe. This has meant a lot to me. I hope so. And any time you want to talk about anything, - I'll be glad to help. - Thank you, sir. I will. - Goodbye, Mrs. Coe. - Goodbye. - Bye, Jess. - Goodbye, Bill. - And good luck. - Thank you. Wasn't I right, Larry? Quite a guy. Bill. When I sent that telegram to you yesterday, I sent one to Judy. Do you know if she got it? Well, I don't know, but we can call her from the station. No. I don't blame her for not coming. Did she ever tell you about us, Bill? She didn't have to. She was pretty broken up about it. Attention please. Attention please. All passengers for Norristown, Bethswood, Phoenixville, Pottstown, Burch Burrough, and Reading now loading at gate 14. Here we are, you've got just five minutes to... What's the matter, Bill? Is this the wrong gate? No, no, no. Everything is fine. You stay here, I've gotta go and get some cigarettes. I'll be right back. Hello, soldier. Is it really you? Larry. What happened at home? Nevermind that now. Larry. I've got to know. I told you I wanted security, remember? Yes. Well, I was looking for it in all the wrong places. Nobody can ever give it to you, Judy. That way it costs too much. You gotta make it for yourself, or it's no good. I know that, I knew it then. We'll find it, Judy. Hey. - Do you know something else? - What? We're gonna be a lawyer. Of course we are, and someday a judge. Yeah, why not! Better come along, Sarge, if you're taking this train. Larry. When shall I come up to Avon? This week, next week? I'll call you, Judy. But soon. Please, darling, soon. So long, Larry. So long, Bill. Thanks for everything. Here, I'll take you to the gate. Goodbye, Judy. Goodbye, Larry. Gosman. Henry, William. - Nemire. - Check. - Campanella. - Right. - Morgan. - Here. Joe. Joe, is that you? Joe, where are you? It's me, Larry. Hello, Larry. Joe. Joe, this is great. Let's get back into the line, soldier. You guys can pick it up later. Wait for me up there. - O'Brien. - Okay, Larry. - Myers. - Here. - Nevins. - Here. Ship. Dorin. - Over here, Larry. - Hudson. How was your furlough, Joe? Did you have a good time? Pretty good, only no one would tell me - where the bathrooms were. - Yeah, same here. Say Joe. We're still friends, aren't we? Sure, Larry, if you want to be. I want to be. Hey, come on inside. We'll get some seats. You know, Joe, the most wonderful thing happened to me today, I gotta tell you about it. As a matter of fact, it was two things.
