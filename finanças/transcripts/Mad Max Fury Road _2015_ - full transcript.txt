Sure. - You can ask for more than a jacket. - We're going to the Green Place. Wait, it's you and me. Ugh! [GIRLS SHRIEK] We're going to the Green Place of Many Mothers.

Not without them. So we wait. You're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man. You've damaged one of his wives. How grateful do you think he's gonna be? You're sitting on 2000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine. I'd say you got about a five-minute head start. You want that thing off your face? Let's go. Ah, uh-uh. [WHIRRING] [ENGINE STARTING] Of all the legs you had to shoot, that one was attached to his favorite. [GRUNTS] Smeg! You don't have to do it just because he tells you. - What choice does she have?

Nah, stay out of there. Behind you. Huh? The Gas Town Boys. [MAX GRUNTS THEN TOAST GRUNTS] Don't damage the goods. FURIOSA: What do you see?

I think it's the fuel pod. MAX: No, no. I'll go. [HYDRAULIC LINES HISS] - Filth! You traitored him! GIRLS: Ah! [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] SPLENDID: No unnecessary killing! - This War Boy wants me dead! - We agreed! He's kamakrazee! He's just a kid at the end of his half-life! No! I live. I die. I live again! CAPABLE: Hold him! SPLENDID: Tie him up! Throw him out! CAPABLE: Chuck him out! You got more friends. [NUX CHUCKLING] Bullet Farmer. - They're coming from the Bullet Farm. - Yeah? It's over. You can't defy him. Just watch us, mate! NUX: He is the one... ...who grabbed the sun. SPLENDID: Look how slick he's fooled you. - He's a lying old man. NUX: By his hand... ...we'll be lifted up! SPLENDID: That's why we have... ...his logo seared on our backs! "Breeding Stock!" "Battle Fodder!" No, I am awaited! CAPABLE: You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"! SPLENDID: Killing everyone... ...and everything. NUX: We're not to blame! Then who killed the world? [GRUNTS] [PANTING] FURIOSA: I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage. I don't know if it's still any good. Get back in the hold! Keep the hatch open. I need you here. You may have to drive the Rig. Mm. You. You stay. You stay there. Whatever you do, you can't be seen. I'm supposed to be alone. That was the deal. MAX: Down here. Hey. What's your name? What do I call you? Does it matter? Fine. When [ yell "fool"... ...you drive out of here as fast as you can. This is the sequence: One. One, two. One. Red. Black. Go. You have it? FURIOSA: It's all here! Three thousand gallons of guzzoline, just like you asked! I'm gonna unhitch the pod. You drop the rocks. [ENGINES REVVING] MAN: You said: "A few vehicles in pursuit. Maybe." We count three War Parties! Yeah, well, I got unlucky. Let's do this! [GASPS] [COUGHS] [WOMAN GASPS] FURIOSA: Fool! [GUN FIRING] [GRUNTS] MAN: That's our fuel! [YELLS] MAN 1: Make way for the Ripsaw! [MEN YELLING] MAN 2: Come on! Move them! IMMORTAN: Once I'm over... ...Clear the rocks and bring everyone through. MAN: Immortan! Immortan Joe! I got a War Boy! Says he was on the War Rig. You! Climb aboard! MAN: Hey. Hey! I got his boot! I got the Blood Bag's boot! Take me! I got his boot! All this for a family squabble. Healthy babies. [SCOFFS] [MEN YELLING AND CHEERING] [WOMEN GASP] [WHIMPERING] [MEN SHOUTING] Aah! [GASPS] FURIOSA: Reload the clip. I can't. Gun! Gimme the gun! Not loaded yet! Now! We had a deal! Ugh! [GASPS] [MEN YELLING] [GRUNTING] [CONTINUES GRUNTING] Rictus! The wives! RICTUS: No more flames. IMMORTAN: Splendid! Splendid! That's my child! My property! Immorta-- Immortan. If I get on the Rig, there's a way inside. - What is your name? - It's Nux. I'll pike her in the spine. Keep her breathing. IMMORTAN: No. Put a bullet in her skull. Stop the Rig, return my treasures to me... ...and I, myself, will carry you... ...to the Gates... ...of Valhalla. Am I awaited? You will ride eternal... ...shiny and chrome. Rictus! Help him aboard! Ready? Here we go! [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Aah! [GRUNTS] Mediocre! Schlanger! [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] CHEEDO: Look out! IMMORTAN: Angharad! Get out! [GASPS] [GASPING] No! Angharad! Stop! Turn the Rig around! Go back for her! No. Tell him to turn the Rig around! Did you see it? She went under the wheels. Did you see it? She went under the wheels. We keep moving. CHEEDO: No! - We keep moving! CHEEDO: He doesn't know what he's talking about! Whatever happens, we're going to the Green Place. The stupid Green Place. We don't even know where to find it! [MACHINE GUN FIRING] [IMMORTAN GRUNTS] - You all right? - On! On! [IMMORTAN GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [ENGINE CLANKS THEN HISSES] CAPABLE: Cheedo! THE DAG: Cheedo, don't be stupid. CAPABLE: Stop! He'll forgive us. I know he will. There is no going back! CHEEDO: We were his treasures! CAPABLE: Cheedo! CHEEDO: We were protected! He gave us the high life! - What's wrong with that? THE DAG: We are not things. CHEEDO: No! [GASPS] THE DAG: We are not things! CAPABLE: We are not things. -1 don't want to hear that again! - They were her words! And now she's dead! THE DAG: Wring your hands and tear your hair... ...but you're not going back. You're not going back to him. Angharad! Come on! Come on! So, um, ahem... ...where is this... ...Green Place? It's a long night's run, heading east. We need inventory. Match every gun with its bullets. I'm gonna go and do some repairs. We need someone down the back. I'll go. No. I want you to stay together. I can do It. [NUX GROANS AND WHIMPERS] What are you doing here? He saw it. He saw it all. My own Blood Bag driving the Rig that killed her. [WHIMPERING] Stop doing that. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Stop. Three times the gates were open to me. What gates? I was awaited in Valhalla. They were calling my name. I should be walking with the Immorta. McFeasting with the heroes of all time. I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to. I thought I was being spared for something great. I got to drive a pursuit vehicle. For a while even Larry and Barry stopped chewing on my windpipe. Who are Larry and Barry? My mates. Larry and Barry. If they don't get me, then the Night Fevers will. Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here, so he's all but useless. But... ...we can squirt off this little pinky a raunchy 29 times. Angharad used to call them Antiseed. Plant one and watch something die. [CREAKING] [MEN YELLING] [PLAYING ROCK RIFF] MAN: Hold on, mate. [PLAYING MENACING RIFF] [MEN YELLING] We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline... ...19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes... ...seven pursuit vehicles. The deficit mounts. And now, sir... ...you have us stuck in a quagmire. MAN: Hey, Joe! Boss! Your girly's breathing her last! What about the child? Are you coming, brother? Wait! It's gone awful quiet in there. Get it out. Get it out! Come on! I've been called to the torture! Patience! Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy. - I'll fetch them for you. - Be careful! Protect the assets! Just one angry shot... ...for Furiosa. Hut! Yeah! Crying shame. Heh. Come. Another month... ...could have been your viable human! Was it a male? Your A-1 Alpha prime. Hey, Rictus! You lost a baby brother! Perfect in every way. I had a baby brother! I had a little baby brother! And he was perfect! Perfect in every way! Come on. [ENGINE REVVING] Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir. Just probing. [GRUNTS] He wants to help! Who? The War Boy! Where did he come from? I thought we threw him off the Rig! There's high ground... - ...just beyond that thing. - He means the tree. Yeah. Tree! FURIOSA: Leave him to me. Say, anyone notice that bright light? Encroaching gunfire? Get out. I can do this. I know this machine. CAPABLE: He does. He's a Revhead. You've got two left! On him. [GUN FIRING] Don't breathe. Ugh! TOAST: Hey! Hey! Hey! War Boy! I'm gonna use the winch around the tree thing! Take this. Let's get the engine plates. You drive the Rig! - Hold up a flare! - I am holding a flare! - Closer! - It's right in front of your eyes! Aah! [ENGINE REVVING] Hut! Hut! Blood Bag! [PANTING] I am the scales of justice! Conductor of the choir of death! Sing, Brother Heckler. Sing, Brother Koch! Sing, brothers, sing! Sing! Don't they know they're shooting at us? [GASPING] [BULLETS RICOCHETING] Gun fever! [ENGINE REVS] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [GRUNTING] [CREAKING] [CHUCKLES] I never thought I'd do something as shine as that. How are the engines? Very hot and real thirsty. Hey. You need to take the War Rig half a klick down the track. What if you're not back by the time the engines have cooled? Well, you keep moving. What do you suppose he's gonna do? FURIOSA: Retaliate first. Let's go! [PANTING] [GUN FIRING IN DISTANCE] [EXPLOSION] [BIRDS CAWING] [BIRDS CAWING] [BIRDS CONTINUE CAWING] - Are you hurt? - Huh? You're bleeding. That's not his blood. What is this? It's Mother's Milk. [BIRDS CAWING] It's okay. Sleep. Get some rest. How do you know this place even exists? I was born there. So why'd you leave? I didn't. I was taken as a child. Stolen. You done this before? Many times. Now that I drive a War Rig... ...this is the best shot I'll ever have. And them? They're looking for hope. What about you? Redemption. Hey, what's that? I remember something like that. WOMAN: Help me! [SOBBING] Help me! - Help me, please! - Uh, uh. Please! That's bait. Stay in the Rig. WOMAN: Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back! FURIOSA: I am one of... ...the Vuvalini! Of the Many Mothers! My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon! I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa. My clan was Swaddle Dog! [ULULATING] [ENGINES ROARING] It's me. There's something in the eyes. Perhaps it is Jabassa's child. This is our Furiosa. How long has it been? Seven thousand days. Plus the ones I don't remember. Furiosa. What happened to your mother? She died. On the third day. From where did you come? The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains. The men. Who are they? They're reliable. They helped us get here. Where did you find such creatures? So soft. This one has all her teeth! [OLD WOMEN LAUGHING] Oh. [ALL LAUGHING] I can't wait for them to see it. See? See what? Home. The Green Place. But if you came from the West... ...you passed it. The crows. The creepy place with all the crows. - The soil. - We had to get out. - We had no water. - The water was filth. It was poisoned. It was sour. WOMAN 1: And then the crows came. WOMAN 2: We couldn't grow anything. WOMAN 3: Where are the others? WOMAN 1: What others? WOMAN 3: The Many Mothers. WOMAN 1: We're the only ones left. [SCREAMING AGONIZINGLY] CHEEDO: Look. That's what you call a satellite. TOAST: Miss Giddy told us about those. They used to bounce messages across the Earth. Shows. Everyone in the old world had a show. CHEEDO: Do you think there's still... ...somebody out there? Sending shows? VALKYRIE: Who knows? Those are the Plains of Silence. Stay right where you are, little Joe. Kind of lost its novelty out here. You having a baby? Warlord Junior. Gonna be so ugly. It could be a girl. You kill people with that, do you? Killed everyone I ever met out here. Headshots. All of them. Snap. Right in the medulla. Thought somehow you girls were above that. Come here. Take a peek. THE DAG: Seeds. These are from home. Heirlooms. The real thing. I plant one every chance I get. Where? So far, nothing's took. Earth's too sour. Aah. So many different kinds. Trees, flowers, fruit. Back then, everyone had their fill. Back then, there was no need to snap anybody. Can I talk to you? I've talked with the others. We're never gonna have a better chance to make it across the salt. If we leave the Rig here, and load the motorcycles up with as much as we can... ...we can maybe ride for 160 days. One of those bikes is yours. Fully loaded. You're more than welcome to come with us. I'll make my own way. You know, hope is a mistake. If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh... You'll go insane. GIRL: Where are you, Max? Where are you? Help us. You promised to help us. Come on, Pal! Let's go. All right. This is your way home. We go back? Mm. - Back? - Yeah. I thought you weren't insane anymore. What are they saying? He wants to go back from where they came. The Citadel. What's there to find at the Citadel? Green. TOAST: And water. There's a ridiculous amount of clear water. And a lot of crops. Got everything you need. Long as you're not afraid of heights. Where does the water come from? He pumps it up from deep in the earth. Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself. THE DAG: And because he owns it, he owns all of us. I don't like him already. It'll take two weeks to skirt the Wall of Mountains. MAX: No. I suggest we go back the same way we came. Through the canyon. It's open. We know that. Right? He brought all his war parties through. So we take the War Rig and we charge it right through the middle of them. We can decouple the tanker... ...at the pass. Shut it off behind us. Kaboom. [ALL LAUGH] And how exactly do we take the Citadel? Assuming we're still alive by then. TOAST: If we can block the pass, it'll be easy. All that's left are his War Pups and War Boys too sick to fight. CAPABLE: And we'll be with Nux. He's a War Boy. He'll be bringing us home. Bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to. N[9)& Yeah. It feels like hope. WOMAN: I like this plan. We can start again. Just like the old days! MAX: Look. It'll be a hard day. But I guarantee you that a 160 days' ride that way... ...there's nothing but salt. At least that way, you know, we might be able to... ...together... ...come across some kind of redemption. [HUMMING] MAN: War Rig! That's the War Rig! That's them. Why are they going back? Do they wish to surrender? They are heading for the canyon. They're going back to the Citadel! They know it's undefended! Bollocks! MAN: Roll up! [GRUNTING] [GUITAR PLAYS HEAVY METAL RIFF] [ALL YELLING] Go! [EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE] [RUMBLING IN DISTANCE] - What are you doing? - Praying. To who?
