(Petra exclaims in Serbo-Croatian) Why you not ring me when I worry about you?! Not to hear nothing. No call, no Twitter, no Snap... chat shot. I think she's dead, she's had lapse, she's never coming home, like her father who is never here. My life is hell, Katarina. It's "Kate." It's "Kate." "Kate" is not a name. "Katarina" is name. Katarina. Cat is animal. Cat, dog. What I call Marta? Dog. I call you cat. -Meow. -(clears throat) Yeah, no, great, but can I get some sleep? One of us should sleep. I don't sleep. -Yeah. -This is very... -This is naughty. -Yeah. Mum! Can I please just go to sleep? Yes, you sleep. We talk morning. -You are clean, hmm? -This... Yeah, yeah, um... -Pillow. Pillow. -Okay. Um, yeah, it's a pillow. -Head. Sleep. -Yeah, I am gonna... I'm good. (mutters) -Hmm. -KATE: Yeah, okay. (sighs) Okay. -Good night. -Naughty. (yawns) Oh, God.

I'm sure it is. Uh, what about sleep? -Yeah, it's all right. -She never sleeps. -Exercise? -Religiously. -Not at all. -Alcohol? -Every once in a while. Oh, she's drinking like the pirate. -You say you're okay. -KATE: Yep. And your mother says the opposite. Who do I believe? -Me, obviously. -Me, the mother, of course. -All right, all right, listen. -(Petra scoffs) There's nothing conclusive here, but you, Kate, you've got to take care of your heart. You need to rest more, -eat better, drink less... -Da. Da. Da. -and stop being so angry. -Da. -(Kate groans) And you, Mrs. Andrich... you need to worry less. I not sleeping. Can you please give me something for sleeping? Mrs. Andrich, you've been given everything there is for sleep, anxiety, panic attacks, the lot. You have the best that modern medicine has to offer. -Then what can I do? -Join a club. Hmm? Talk to other people. Enjoy time with your friends. -All my friends were murdered. -Okay, fine. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time. -But it's-it's true. -Let's go, Mum. Come on. -They took them. -Mum, come on. Come on. I know. -Thank you. Um... -Come on, Mama, out we get.

I come. -Get-get out the-- Right. -I'm coming. -Thank you. -(door closes) -(sighs) Bloody hell. (bell jingles) Can I help? No. I'm having a self-pity party. Ooh. Am I invited? Well, only if you promise to judge me. Oh, you definitely don't need any help doing that. Or maybe you do. I'm very good at tidying up. (clears throat) Yes. -These expensive? -(rattling) (Kate stammers) Idiot. Follow me. Ah. (singsongy): Tra-la. Tra-la. All right, Mr. Muscle, you can get to refreshing that tree. -This one? -Yeah. Going home always makes me crazy. How was it? Hell. Mum sung me to sleep. You're the only person who can make being sung to sleep sound like waterboarding. Well, it's not that dissimilar. (laughing): These, um, folk songs make you want to string yourself up. Is that where you get your singing from? Yeah, she was a singer back in, um, the homeland. Where was that? Former Yugoslavia. We had to escape. -'Cause of the war? -Exactly. Mm. Must have been hard. Yeah. Dad was a lawyer. Um, and now he stays away from home as much as he can because he'd rather be dead. (chuckles) Except he's a minicab driver, which is sort of the same thing. Can he not practice here? No, he couldn't afford to retrain, so he's out all the time. Also to avoid my mother, who's given to depression in much the same way as, um... What? You're looking at me like some sort of science experiment that's gone wrong. Sorry. -No, I'm interested. -Huh. I mean, your mother-- when was the last time you saw her not being depressed? (chuckles) Ooh, I think when I got really ill. And she was happy about that? No, but she was happy about the attention. I mean, I got a lot of attention, but I was unconscious. She got more. Just the doctors, the nurses, the hospital staff. Drama. God, she loved it. She sort of flowered under it like a... like a late blossoming or something. Anyway, when I got better, it all went away, and she's just never been the same since. Well, maybe she enjoyed being needed again. Oh, trust you to come up with something understanding. -That is truly horrific. -(Kate chuckles) I mean, who buys this stuff? Santa. She's Chinese, so she's, you know, got access to some really freaky outlets. She just loves Christmas more than anything else. -More than taste or sanity. -Yes, exactly. And that isn't even the nastiest thing we sell. Inconceivable. Hang on. -♪ Dun, dun, dun! ♪ -Oh! -Check it out. -What is it? -Is that donkey actually smiling at me? -Yeah. Yeah. And that baby has a full set of teeth. -Oof. -I sold four of these last week. I'm that good. (techno version of "Last Christmas" playing) Oh, it's a... oh, it's a techno manger. -Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool. -It's a disco nativity scene. -(laughing) Is that really a good nutritional choice? Oh, God, don't you start. Where are you? Look up. Yeah. Yeah, after you... what you've been through, I mean, shouldn't you be eating quinoa or kale or something? Yeah, but this admittedly rank burger is all part of my grand plan to become a famous singer and die like Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse and all the rest at the age of 27. -How old are you? Oh. Good to have dreams. Not really. I'm 26. Oh, thank God. You still have time. (chuckles) -Come on. Get rid of that. -Where...? Wait. Let's go. I've got a surprise for you. -Ugh, really?

I can't pronounce it. Lots of glottal stops. "Yogh..." (hawking) Oh, when I try to say it, I sound like a cat with a fur ball. So I've decided to call him "Boy." Mm.

Have you got a bourbon, Danny boy? No, but can I press you to a custard cream? Ooh. I wish somebody would. -Tom, did you say? -KATE: Yeah. Tom. Um, h-he's tall... -Tom! -(people murmuring) Take your pick, young lady. Right. Yeah, see, the thing is, he's not homeless. Well, what's he doing here, then? Um, well, he works here. -Nights, I think. -Ah. Well, I don't see the night lot, me. -He must be a volunteer. -Yes. That's... MAN: Oi, Danny! Give us a hand? Speaking of which, be a pet and serve the teas while I get the soup sorted. And only two biscuits each, mind. I'm not made of bloody biscuits. And watch this one, 'cause last week, he filled his pockets. Come on, then! Tea's up! Okay. I'm Tom. -Ex-grenadier. Will I do? -Lovely. Um... KATE: Do you know, actually, it's... a whole different Tom. But would you like a biscuit? I could... make some tea. ARTHUR: Just the two, then? Just... (weakly): Anyone like a cup of tea? Try and keep it down to... Oi, oi. Nice of you to volunteer. Well, I-I didn't. I was press-ganged. You want to help us with the soup? KATE: No. Thank you, but no. If Tom Webster does come in, could you just tell him that Kate needs to talk to him? -Not "needs." -"Would like"? Yeah. Yeah. -Got it. -Yeah, 'cause he doesn't have a phone. Would you like a bowl of soup? You've earned it. No, I'm good. Thanks. Dan, what do you reckon? (sighs) Bit up herself, I thought.

Hey, at last. -(chuckles) -I was so worry. -(Ivan speaks Serbo-Croatian) Where you are, huh? -Huh? -Um, I was volunteering at a homeless shelter. -Uh, what it mean? -It means helping, Mum. -You?

Uh, yeah, I actually do. It means, "I will nail you to my dick." -Yeah, I knew that. -Not "dick." "Penis." Well, "dick" means "penis." -"Dick" means "penis"? -"Dick" means "penis." Yeah. -No, Dick is our neighbor. -It also means "penis." Dick, our-our neighbor, is called "penis"? Dick is penis. Penis is dick. That's the same word. -Would you stop saying "dick" and "penis"? -It's just... -I'm trying to explain. -Uh, uh, whatever, you know. -I'm just so bored of your shit. -Marta, stop. She's ill. -She's not ill anymore, Mum. -She is not ill anymore, Petra. And what you know? What you know anything about this family? You're never here. I'm not ill anymore, all right? No, she is still ill-- why is she still working in silly Christmas shop when she was always the b-bright one? Nabijem te na kurac. (hisses) You are very hard worker. Wha... Oh, right, yeah, well, well, apparently, with my pathetic, inferior little brain. Now she's wasting her life, which only a miracle save her. Wasting my life. Thanks, Mum. And you have job you dream of. Yeah, except that I didn't dream of it, did I? You did. You know, Dad can't be a lawyer here, so I had to be. No matter what I might have actually wanted to do. Yeah, would you rather drive minicab? Look what it done to him. He look thousand years old. Oh, thanks. -Nabijem i tebe na kurac. -MARTA: And you... y-you sit there, and you think it's absolutely acceptable to say that she's cleverer than me. And I'm expected to swallow it just because she's been ill. -Marta, calm down. -No, don't you dare -tell me to calm down, all right? -(groans) -Marta. -All right, you don't care about anything, Katarina, or Kate, or whatever your name is now, because you're ashamed of who you are. Oh, I'm ashamed of who I am? -(scoffs) -What about you? Where's Alba? (quietly): Shut up. On your big celebration dinner, where is your girlfriend? PETRA: Alba? Alba is... Alba is Marta's flatmate. KATE: Yeah, and that's how it's always gonna be. I bet she's really happy about that. What she say? Oh, God, you're a piece of work. (Ivan speaking Serbo-Croatian) Marta. -Marta. -Marta. Eh. Eat. You look like skeleton. I got to go. Goodbye, Mum. (takes deep breath) I will nail you to my dick.

I don't tell people, 'cause they get weird, but I don't think you'll get weird. No. Is this okay? They took out my heart. They took it and threw it away. And I... and I don't know what they put back, but it felt weird and different and strange and... and like I'd lost my most special part. And they kept telling me I was lucky to be alive. But I didn't feel alive. I just felt half dead. Come here. (Kate grunts softly) I was supposed to be special. I didn't ask to be, but... they made me feel special when I was ill.

He seems to be disappearing a lot. Is he a magician? Well, you never know. (chuckles) Probably just scared of what he feels about you. You know, blokes and that. Yeah. (inhales sharply) -Well... -Bon appétit. Boom. Thank you. -See you soon, Kate. -Bye. -Hi. -Hey. (Kate sighs) Hi. Hi. How've you been? Missing you. KATE: Mm. Mm. Missing and kissing. It's almost like we're having a relationship. Kate, there's something I've got to tell you. (sighing): Oh, God. The "there's something I've got to tell you" moment. Okay. Okay, let's go through the list. Um... You're gay? -No, it's... -Married? -No, there's... -Uh, y-you need space? You can't depend on me. I don't depend on you. -Kate. -(stammers) Who said anything about depending on anyone? Listen, you said it yourself. I mean, you've been having a tough time after all the trauma and... Look, I'm just worried... Oh, so now it's my issue? -No, you... -Look, if this is about commitment, then you just need to say it, because I... I can't do this anymore. I look for you. I look for you everywhere, and you're never there. And it makes me feel really bad about myself. And I'm finally getting better and not feeling bad about myself. I'm not gonna heal my heart and then give it to someone who is going to break it. I won't. No, Kate... (conversation nearby in Serbo-Croatian) -(speaking Serbo-Croatian) -(bell dings) Why don't you lot go back to where you came from? Yeah, you. Speak English, or get out of my sodding country. All of ya! (riders murmuring) (speaking Serbo-Croatian) -(woman speaks Serbo-Croatian) -(Kate laughs) (dog barking nearby) (doorbell rings) -Hello. -Hi. Alba? I'm Kate. -Kate? -Katarina. - Kate?-Katarina. Yep. Just wondering if Marta was in. She doesn't want to talk to you. Yeah. Okay. I understand. Uh... Could you just tell her that I'm very sorry? That I will probably never stop being sorry. That I'm glad that she has you. I'm... and I'm-I'm sorry... that you and I never got the chance to know each other. -Wait. -MARTA: Oh, for God's sake. (Marta sighs) Hi. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. Please don't come here uninvited again. I wish Mum and Dad knew you were happy. It's none of their business. All right, saying sorry doesn't change everything. You do understand that? Yeah. MARTA (sighing): Oh, God. Hey. Look. We weren't so lucky, you and I. Mum is a piece of work. You're right about that. But I guess maybe we're all a bit damaged in this family. And I do appreciate you stopping by.
