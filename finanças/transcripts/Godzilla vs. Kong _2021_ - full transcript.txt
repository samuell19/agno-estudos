Mm. Alert, biodome breach. Alert, biodome breach. Dr. Andrews, did you see that? The habitat's not gonna hold much longer. We need to start thinking about off-site solutions. The island is the one thing that's kept him isolated. If he leaves, Godzilla will come for him. There can't be two alpha Titans. The whole theory of an ancient rivalry stems from Iwi mythology. He's gotten too big over time. This environment won't sustain much longer. It's too unstable. Hey. Off-site would be a death sentence. You don't think the King could take care of himself? There has to be another way. Finding the origin of these creatures is essential to mankind's survival. The interior of the Earth is made up of vast cabins and air pockets, joined by natural avenues. The admiral begins his expedition, searching for an entrance to a hidden world. The purpose is the discovery and the release to the world of the unknown treasures of Antarctica in the interests of all mankind. Members of the lost party were never seen again. Still no word on what may have happened. There's an ecosystem out there, the likes of which we can't imagine. And the place to find it is this island. Hello, loyal listeners. Welcome to TTP, Titan Truth Podcast. Episode number 245. Today is the day. Maybe the last podcast I ever record. And look, I know I said that last week and maybe the week before and a few other times. But, look, this is the point. After five years of deep cover at Apex Cybernetics, I'm finally taking my shot. Something bad is going on here. I don't know what it is, but I'm about to walk in and download hard evidence and expose a vast corporate conspiracy. Yeah, you can call me a whistleblower, but I ain't just whistling. I mean, this is more than a leak. It's a flood. And believe me, this flood is gonna wash away all of Apex's lies. You can believe that. Welcome to Apex Cybernetics. No unauthorized persons allowed beyond this point. When we started Apex Cybernetics, we dreamt of new ways to push past the limits of human potential. Robotics, the human mind, artificial intelligence. Who knows what brave new future we'll dream of next? I'm Walter Simmons, and it is my privilege to lead Apex into humanity's bold new era. We're not going anywhere. And neither are you. There you are, baby. No, don't eat that! It's incredibly unhealthy. It's just all the GMOs. Growing a second head could be useful. You have to let me know. Because me, myself? I can barely handle the one I got. Bernie, you're not supposed to be in here. You ever wonder what we're really doing here? I mean, really doing here. Why are you here? This isn't Engineering. Because, you know, I had to wait because they're rendering these new specs, which is gonna take over, uh... That's calculator mode. ...over one hour, maybe even more. So my foreman told me to just take a walk - and make some new friends. - Oh. Oh! Now that we're new friends, I can share something with you, right? I know it's in here somewhere. This is hand sanitizer that I made from my own garden. It's really amazing. Don't know if I used that or not. Yes. This. Check this out. That right there is radio mesh networking with a voice-record subprocessor. - Guess from where. Come on. - I don't care. A toaster! It's from a toaster. Look at this thing. I have to go to the bathroom. Is it one or two? 'Cause if it's two, it's probably from these apples. Hey, you wanna use the hand sanitizer that I made? I'm good. Okay, I'll just stay here. Okay. Yeah. Ah, let's see. Whoo. Screen. What are they shipping to Hong Kong? What's Sublevel 33? What the...? Evacuation, Titan alert. This is not a drill. All Apex employees, please proceed... That is my cue. That's my cue. This is not a drill. Proceed to the fallout shelter in a single-file line. Let's go! They used cyanide capsules instead of fallout shelters to keep the secrets in, but, you know, that's neither here nor there, so don't listen to me. Level two personnel, this way! Let's go, let's go! Yeah, that way. It's time! We need to go now! Evacuate. One level at a time, okay. - No. - Hey, you! - Where's your clearance tag? - You know what? The fact that you're talking about clearance tags right now in a time of crisis is incredibly unprofessional. We should be talking about evacuation. Yo! Okay! Oh, my God. Oh, no. What the hell is that? This is CNN breaking news. The United States Navy's Fourth Fleet is deployed off the southeastern seaboard of the U.S. after last night's sudden Godzilla attack. A time of relative peace shattered when the massive Titan, once thought to be a hero to humanity, made landfall in Pensacola, Florida. While the damage was largely contained to the U.S. headquarters of Apex Cybernetics, governments around the world aren't taking any chances after the first substantiated Titan sighting in over three years. CEO Walter Simmons had this to say. It's about working together to ensure a safer world. Godzilla's a threat to humanity, and Apex has a plan to deal with it, once and for all. Students and faculty, please be advised a mandatory assembly will be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon. Guidance counselors will also be holding additional office hours all this week for individual and group sessions. Welcome back, loyal listeners, to Titan Truth Podcast, episode 246. Oh, my God. I was there. Godzilla's Apex attack. I saw it go down! You think it's a coincidence that he reappears and just so happens to destroy that specific facility? Ha-ha, no, no, no, no. No such thing as coincidence. Dad, I'm telling you, there's something provoking him that we're not seeing here. Why else would Godzilla flash an intimidation display if there wasn't another Titan around? That podcast is filling your head with garbage. - You should be in school. - I am just trying to help. I don't want you to help. I want you to stay safe. We needed a plan to keep peace with these things, and the best one we had just went down in flames. I don't have any more. And the last thing that I need is to be worrying about you. Godzilla saved us. You were there with Mom. You saw it. How could you doubt him? - There has to be a pattern. - There doesn't. - A reason why he was provoked. - There isn't. How do you know that? Because creatures, like people, can change. And right now, Godzilla's out there and he's hurting people, and we don't know why. So cut your pop some slack, would ya? See you at home, Dad. You wanna know my theory? I mean, of course you do. That's why you're here. Come on, it's all about patterns and variables. Oh, wait, stick with me. I'm gonna take you back to sixth grade with this, okay? Godzilla attacks when provoked, that's the pattern. Pensacola is the only coastal Apex hub with an advanced robotics lab. That's the variable. And add them up and your answer is that Apex is at the heart of the problem. Can I help you? If you want an appointment, my office hours are nine to five. - Please, Dr. Lind. - What the f... Guys like you and me, we don't do normal hours, do we? I've been fixated on Hollow Earth for as long as you have. Your theory that it's the birthplace of all Titans is fascinating. Your book was very impressive. Oh, yeah? Well, I got about 30 unsold boxes in my apartment if you want some. Walt Simmons. I know who you are, sir. It's an honor. No, the honor is mine. As is the urgency. Godzilla has never attacked us unprovoked before. These are dangerous times, Dr. Lind. Allow me to introduce our Apex chief technology officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa. He has an interesting thing to show you. Magnetic imaging from one of our new satellites. You know what this is, right? Hollow Earth. An ecosystem as vast as any ocean, right beneath our feet. This energy signal is enormous. And almost identical to readings from Gojira. As our sun fuels the planet's surface, this energy sustains the Hollow Earth, enabling life as powerful as our aggressive Titan friend. If we can harness this life force, we'll have a weapon that can compete with Godzilla. I need your help to find it. I don't know if I'm the right guy for the job. Did you read the reviews? "A sci-fi quack trading in fringe physics." Look where they put my office. I'm in the basement right across from flute class. Besides, I'm not with Monarch anymore. And Hollow Earth entry is impossible. We tried. I'm sorry about your brother. He was a true pioneer. Thanks. See, all of our forward scans suggest a habitable environment down there. So, what really went wrong on your brother's mission? When they tried to enter, they hit a gravitational inversion. A whole planet's worth of gravity reversed in a split second. They were crushed in an instant. What if I told you that we, at Apex, have created a phenomenal craft which could sustain such an inversion? The Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle. HEAV. We can make the journey to Hollow Earth possible, Dr. Lind. But we need you to lead the mission. Help me. Help everyone. Finding this needle in a haystack is our best shot against Godzilla. Well, I, uh, might have an idea. But it's crazy. I love crazy ideas. They made me rich. Are you guys familiar with genetic memory? It's a theory that all Titans share a common impulse to return to their evolutionary source. Like spawning salmon. Exactly. Or a... Or a homing pigeon. So if this is the Titans' home and this life force sustains them... A Titan could show you the way. Yeah. With a little help of an old colleague. Ugh, where is it? Dr. Andrews, you have a visitor waiting for you at security. Okay. A power source in Hollow Earth? This sounds nuts, Nathan, even for you. It's there! We just need Kong to bring us to it! The second you take Kong out of containment, Godzilla's gonna come for him. You said you can't keep him here forever. No. Our meddling has already wreaked havoc on Kong's habitat. No way am I letting you drag him halfway across the world to use him as a weapon. No, not as a weapon. As an ally. To protect us, lead the way down there. What even makes you think that he'll go in? You always believed that Skull Island was like Hollow Earth come to the surface, right? And that's where Kong's ancestors came from. Mm-hmm. Through the entrance in Antarctica, we could help him find a new home. And he could save ours. Hers. That power source may be our only hope. We gotta stop Godzilla. This is our only chance. We have to take it. - Okay. - Yes! But when it comes to Kong, what I say goes. You name the terms. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. You won't regret this. Mm, I already regret this. Come on. Whoo! Jeez, I can smell him from up here. Well, he can smell you, too. Still not a fan, huh? What's she saying? Just an Iwi expression. It means that you're very brave. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Hey, use a light touch on the sedatives. He's our escort. We can't have him comatose when we reach Hollow Earth. What if Kong doesn't go willingly? What do you do then? Dr. Lind, please report to the forward deck. Dr. Lind. Excuse me. New arrivals. Welcome. Wow. Who's the idiot who came up with this idea? - Ha-ha. - I'm Maia Simmons. My father sent me. I run point for Apex. Nathan Lind, mission chief. Yeah, don't worry. I'm just here to babysit. The Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicles are on their way to Antarctica as we speak. I know you people think you're cutting-edge, but these prototypes we're loaning you will make what you've been flying look like used Miatas. I love Miatas. Forget about the price tag, which is obscene, of course. The antigravity engines alone produce enough charge to light up Vegas for a week. Feel free to be impressed. Wow. All right, we'll be at the Antarctica entry in 48 hours. This path will get us into Hollow Earth. Once we're inside, Kong should lead us to the power source. Now, the gravitational inversion will be quite intense. Our best guess is that on entry, it'll feel like bungee jumping... with the cord tied to your lower intestine. But if your helicopters are as good as you say... HEAVs. If your HEAVs are as good as you say they are, I believe we can do this. They'll do the job. You just gotta do yours. Excellent. Dr. Andrews. We've avoided all of Godzilla's known territorial waters according to your guidelines. Good. Do I need to be concerned? Yes. They do have a way of sensing threats. And we believe that they had an ancient rivalry. The myths say that their ancestors fought each other in a great war. So if they meet again, who bows to who, is that it? No, I spent 10 years on that island studying him. I know this for sure. Kong bows to no one. Is she supposed to be out there? Jia, come on. Come on. Did the monkey just talk? Okay, class, listen up. In the midst of Godzilla's attack on Apex Pensacola, I found some crazy tech with no official classification. What I saw doesn't match any of the engineering specs I've ever seen. So what are they working on in such blackout secrecy, hmm? This could be the thread that finally unravels the Apex sweater of conspiracy. You better believe I'm gonna keep tugging. For now, I'm secure. Anonymous and hiding in plain sight as I continue my mission. To be clear, my brother can never know we took his van. Josh, to be clear, even if we got into an accident, I don't think he could tell. No, no, my brother would never let you drive either. My mission, my wheel. I just don't think it's a good idea, looking for some secret weirdo off the Internet. I mean, we just had an assembly about this. He's not a weirdo. He's a covert investigator. And he's the only one looking for the truth about Godzilla and Apex. So let him look. Why do we have to help him? Because... If we don't, nobody else will. Are you coming or not? Obviously I'm coming. It's stuck. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Mind control. Read up on it, sheep. Psionic link technology is a reality. That's right. One brain controlling another. Oh, man. Imagine that on a global scale and Apex is invincible. We've been listening to this weirdo for hours. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Knock it off! Wait, this is the part I was telling you about. ...need special UV to even know you've been marked! One or two gallons won't cut it. I need my bleach in bulk! Because spy dust is real, people! I mean, come on, invisible to the naked eye... That's how we find him. - The bleach. - Bleach? He consumes a ton of bleach. He drinks bleach? Showers with it. Oh! Yeah, I shower with bleach. No, what? Prevention against organic tracking technology. See? Tradecraft. Would've made more sense if he just drank it. Come on, just one more place. Madison, this is getting old. Hey, you sell bleach? Is this another one of those Internet challenge things? When I sold those kids those detergent pods, I didn't know they were gonna eat them. I'm still dealing with the lawsuits from that. Look, we're looking for a guy who works for Apex Cybernetics. Buys a lot of bleach. Like every night. He's probably paranoid, high-strung, doesn't like daylight. You know, has a lot of crumbs in his beard, if he has a beard. Okay, look, you kids want some candy? Because I can help you with candy. Look at me in the eye. Okay? I need information. Yeah, we want lots of candy. What are you doing? You think...? Oh, you mean Bernie. Yeah, I know that guy. He buys, like, a ton of bleach. I know where he is, too. If you buy a live fish, I'll give you his address. Bernie? Mister... Mis... Mister Bernie not home. Yep, that was definitely Mister Bernie. Yeah. Um... Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk about Apex and Godzilla. No. No. No. I... I got your faces. I contact authorities. Yes. For knocking on a door? No. No. Bernie, you don't trust the authorities. My name is Madison Russell. My father works for Monarch and my mother was... Emma Russell, right? Before we go any farther, I got one question. Tap or no tap? No tap. - Excuse me, what is "tap"? - Water. They put fluoride in it. Learned it from the Nazis. Theory is it makes you docile, easy to manipulate. Oh, I drink tap water. Yeah, I kind of figured that. But she does the thinking for both of you, so it should be all right. - Thanks. - Okay. What you got? I believe Godzilla's most recent attacks haven't just been random. I think he targeted the Apex facility. I'm of the same opinion. But why? What is Apex up to that's provoking him? For five years, I embedded myself inside this company, trying to figure out what their game was. Then, last week... I saw this. A manifest of huge cargo being sent from here to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong, which makes no sense because we are not equipped for heavy shipping. - Then what? - And then boom! Godzilla shows up. Caved in half the facility, but I got a sneak peek at some suspicious tech which was hidden in a secret bunker. I mean, some pretty damn suspicious tech. Yeah, but what is that? That's, um... That's Katzunari single malt whiskey. Yeah, but it's in a gun holster. It was a gift from my Sara. You have a Sara? She was my wife. Um, she passed on. She was my rock. My truth. I'll tell you something, the day that this goes empty, that's the day you know I've given up. Bernie. I think we can help each other. Okay, I guess now that we're a team, I feel like we should come up with a plan. We're breaking into Apex. - Wait, what? - You heard her. Tap water. Shit. Hey. Thank you. How is she? Calm. So calm, it's scary. That was extraordinary. I have been signing the alphabet. Basic commands. I thought that he showed recognition, but he never... Do you have any idea how long they've been communicating? No. I knew that they had a bond. He trusts her. Without her, he'd be tearing the ship apart. You know, Jia's parents were killed on the island. When the storm took over the island, it wiped out the native people. But Kong saved her. She had nowhere to go. So I made a promise, then and there, to protect her. And I think that in some way, he did the same. Do you think he would take directions from her? No. If we have someone who can keep the reins on Kong... Yeah, no one can keep the reins on Kong. And she's a child. I know Jia is only a child. But she's the only one he'll communicate with. And we need Kong to find that power source. The world needs him. What's she saying? Godzilla. Did we change course? No. We're nowhere near the areas you flagged. It looks like he's coming for us anyway. He's not coming for us. Him? Then dump him. Dump the monkey! How about we throw you off instead, huh? We have to release him. If we lose Kong, the mission is over. He's a sitting duck out there. We have to let him protect himself. And us. Oh, my God, Jia! Nathan? He needs our help. There must be some way to disorient Godzilla. Depth charges. He's circling back. This won't end until one of them submits. - Shut it down. - What? All of it. Guns, engines. - Shut it down. Right now. - If we do that, we're dead. No, we're playing dead. And we're making him think that he's won. Cut the power. Cut the engines. Kill anything that makes a noise. This better work. As soon as we move, he'll be back. How are we supposed to get the rest of the way? How's Kong with heights? So, what's the plan? We find out what's on Sublevel 33. Ow. Keep it moving, tap water. Go ahead. All right, Mad Hatter. Down the rabbit hole. Okay. We got this. Oh, my God! Are you sure we can trust this guy? Yeah, why? Well, mainly because he says crazy shit all the time and carries a bottle of whiskey from his dead wife like a gun. I think it's romantic. Whoo-hoo! I really don't understand women. Okay, come on. This whole thing came down, and there was this... eye. Uh, what are we looking at? No, no, no, no. No, it was here. I swear to God, it was... it was right there. Hey, guys. Anyone know where this leads to? You believe me, right? 'Cause I know that there was something here. I'm gonna get a migraine from that torch. "Sublevel." How deep does this thing go, Bernie? Hell. Goes to hell. Sublevel 33. Maglev shuttle departure to Roswell, New Mexico at 0900 hours. Whoa. What is all this? It's breakaway civilization. I mean, come on. This is page one in the Apex-playing-God handbook. Huh? I mean, the Illuminati running shadow economies all to fund a hidden colony for the elite in case any of these governments and megacorporations accidentally hit the doomsday button. It makes sense - if you think about it. - Yeah, sure. - Someone's coming. - What? - Someone's coming. - What? - Someone's coming? - Yes! Oh, my God. - They look like eggs. - Skull-crawlers. What's Apex doing with skull-crawlers? All right, let's load it up! What was that? What was that? No way. No, no, no. Come on. Okay, guys, I think we're moving. It says we're headed to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong. - What? - Hong Kong. That means that we're gonna get some answers. G10, clear for launch. Here we go. We're getting close! It's not working. Just wait. Wait, wait, wait. What if she tells him there are others down there like him? But you don't know that. We lost our entire fleet getting here. There's no way back for him. And he can't survive here. All right. All right. Hey. He's going. Prepare to launch! Everybody to their station. We gotta go. All flights crews cleared for immediate HEAV launch. HEAV 1 online. We're clear for launch. Copy that, HEAV 1. HEAV 2 online. Exiting hangar now. HEAV 2, confirmation 4055. This is HEAV 3 online, launching now. We'll follow him from behind. There. There he is. Are you sure the monkey's gonna survive this? Oh, he'll be fine. It's us I'd worry about. We're about to be launched 1,000 miles in two seconds until gravity inverts itself and spits us into free fall. It'll be the most amazing thing you've ever seen. Here. For the vomit. What? Engine failure, gravity low. Engine failure. All Delta, reverse gravity propulsion! It's beautiful. This is HEAV 3, we're getting some strange radar activity. We're gonna circle back and... All Delta, prepare to attack! That's gross. Kong's on the move. We gotta go. Well, he seems to know where he's going. Oh, he certainly can move. Okay, okay. Creepy monorail is slowing down. Attention: Shipping pod arriving. Okay. Keep quiet. Follow me. We're going in? Yeah. Oh, no! Every time, I swear. Doors hate us. Oh, yeah. - Aah! - Oh, my God! It's just so massive. It's so stupid. So, what is this place? Well, if there's a corporate-friendly term for "sacrifice pit," I'd say we are in it. Oh, God, that stinks. That's not good. Bernie! I really hate this place. Attention: Demonstration in T-minus one minute. All personnel are to stay clear of the area. Mr. Simmons, systems are coming online now. Commence uplink. Engaging uplink. Pilot engaged. That's robot Godzilla. Oh, no. That's... That's Mechagodzilla. Release number 10. Go, go! Go through there! Madison! Run, girl! Yes! Damn it. System only reached 40% power. Oh, I know. As expected. Don't worry. Once the Hollow Earth sample is uploaded, our power troubles will be over. If they can find the source. Oh, they'll find it. I have faith in my daughter. I have faith in our creation. And humanity will once again... be the apex species. This is why Godzilla attacked the Apex facility. They're trying to replace him. Come on, Maddie. Sir, Godzilla just made an abrupt change in direction. He's moving very fast. Projections show he's likely headed to Hong Kong. Transport is ready and waiting to take you there, sir. That has to be it. We were right. He's home. All personnel must display their Apex employee badge at all times. Follow me. Lizard people build all their facilities the same way. I can find the exit. The exit's this way. Guys. Madison! Oh, my God. Bitch, what? It's a Titan skull. No, no, no. That's not just any Titan. That's Monster Zero. Ghidorah. They hardwired its DNA. Self-generating neural pathways capable of intuitive learning. Okay, I'm smart, but I only go to high school. - It's a living supercomputer. - Shh. It had three heads. Its necks were so long, they communicated telepathically. And there's one here and another one inside of that thing. Yeah, it could be a psionic interface. Oh, my God. Careful. It's a pilot. Yeah. He's in a trance. That's a psionic uplink. It follows his will. Oh, Apex, what have you done? This is the day we feared. I've given the order, Doctor. The city is being evacuated. I don't understand. He led us here. Where is it? What is he doing? It's the axe. It's drawing radiation from the core like it's charging. Whoa! Godzilla's responding! They found it! What in the hell? What are you doing? Extracting a sample. This is a power beyond our understanding. You can't just drill into it. Actually, we can. My father gets what he wants. That's Apex property now. What? Energy signature incoming. We should be able to recreate it soon. That is the discovery of the millennium. - You can't strip it for parts. - Hold it. Go. Go. Got what we needed. Let's go! Yes. Mr. Serizawa, start your engines! The upgrade is untested. Once we get online, Gojira will come straight for us. He's been coming for us since our creation first awoke. - We must embrace it. - We shouldn't rush this. We have no idea how this energy source will affect the Mecha. Get in the goddamn chair. - Go, go, go! - Come on, come on! Move! What are you waiting for? Let's go! This way, sir! Hurry! We gotta get back... Okay. Get him out of the way! Shoot him! Go, go, go! Oh, no. No, no, no... Oh, Jesus! Come on, let's go! - Hold on, ladies. - Yeah. Whoa. Stay low. Yeah. Going viral. What? We've gotta try and stop this. Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys. If this wasn't contributing to world destruction, this would be a great DJ booth. I know what it... Maintenance. Madison, we should go. I'm Maintenance. You don't have to alert the... She doesn't buy that. Uh, Madison, we need to go. The woman with the villain hairdo... Madison, they have guns. Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof so I can't really... - I wanna communicate... - Open the door! Say again? Oh, God! Get down! Get down! Oh, shit! We're about to breach the veil! Hold on! Looks like round two goes to Kong. Hey! Oh, come on, guys. Really? Greenpeace again? Greenpea... Actually, sir, not like you would know this, but I'm Level Two Assistant Engineering... Well, Provisional Level Two Assistant Engineering, not like you would know that. My evaluations were incredibly encourag... I'm just saying Greenpeace wishes, is all I'm saying. Where do I know you from? Oh, my goodness. Director Russell's daughter, yes? You caused all of this. If by "all of this," you mean I, and I alone, have given humanity a chance against the Titans, then, yes, I will own that title. Godzilla had left us in peace. You provoked him into war. There can only be one alpha, Miss Russell. It seems to have been providence. It's time to launch. Begin pilot integration. And now... my Mecha. It's not only Godzilla's equal... but his superior. The Apex Titan of my own hand. It's time to show the world what you can do. Pilot engaged. Alert: Failure. System unstable. Alert: Failure. System unstable. This is how we, as a species, win. You see, 10 years ago, when Gojira was first revealed to the world, I had a dream. And in that dream, I saw one thing. And that beautiful, amazing thing was... Oh, shit. No! It's unfair. I really wanted to hear the rest of that speech. What in God's name is that? It's thinking for itself now. We have to warn Monarch. Or try to stop it ourselves. That thing's still linked to their satellite. Wait, Josh. If I can figure out the password, maybe we can shut it down. All right. What the hell is that? What? What's happening? She can feel his heartbeat. He's dying. There's nothing we can do to restart his heart. We'd need a charge big enough to... Light up Las Vegas for a week. Is that a password? Is that a password? I don't know! I'm not used to this. I'm used to pirating movies online. Okay, then go to Settings. - This is Mark. - Dad? Madison, where are you? Dad, can you hear... Can you hear me? I'm in Hong Kong. - Mad? - Dad! Mad? Madison! A-ha! Okay, you two better get some distance. Hey. You are a very brave little girl. I don't know. Maybe we both are. Okay. Good luck, big fella. I thought you said you were a hacker! I said I took an HTML course at summer camp. - HTML? - Yes, at summer camp. Was it a '90s camp? Come on. Use QWERTY. Error. Security lock. No. Shit! Shit. Josh! You have to do something. We tried to take down those Apex bastards, but I think this is as far as we go, so bottom's up. I was hoping to die with adults, but okay. If you've never had a drink before, now's the time 'cause... Drink. Drink! Hey! What are you... That's your solution? I gotta die here with you, and sober! - Yeah! - Yes! Yes! Hey, Nathan? Nathan? Nathan, are you okay? Dad? Dad! Dad! Hi. Um, it was, um... Madison's idea. Shut up, Josh. Dad. This is the man who saved our lives. Bernie, meet Dad. Dad. Uh, Bernie. Um, it's an absolute pleasure to meet you. I was wondering if I could invite you onto my podcast to talk about the Monarch facility in Roswell because... It's amazing. It happened... Jia? Jia! Heads up, guys! He's coming around for his morning walk.
