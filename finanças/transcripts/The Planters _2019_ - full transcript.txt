- Hello. - Good morning. My name is Martha Plant, and I'm calling to see if you're interested in staying extra cool this summer. If it were the apocalypse and I could only save one thing, I'd save my shovel. I could fend off unwanted visitors and still keep my planting business. Not my favorite president, but I'll take it. What the hell? It's been a little complicated, you know, since I left. Oh, Carl thought I was going to hell. Carl is a virgin. I've been having sexual intercourse since I was 12-years-old. He decided, probably my soul wasn't safe, called off the wedding. So, I'm just here... Just... trying to make right with Jesus, you know? I'm not really into that kinda stuff. I used to make Carl peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I'd put them in paper bags and drop them by his work. He was the assistant pastor's assistant in our church. Are those your grandparents? They're my parents. You have your mom's cheeks. I'm adopted. - Oh. - I was left in a trash can. Maybe God brought you to the people you were supposed to be with. Mom and dad, in honor of your one year death anniversary, I had my first lunch guest. It was different than with the three of us. She's very weird. Bridges Hospital Mental health center, how may I direct your call? Hi, I'm calling about one of your patients, Sadie Mayflower. She's sleeping on the street with a helmet locked to her head. Oh, yeah, we've been releasing our patients. Why? We're closing our doors due to bankruptcy, and five counts of embezzlement. Okay. So, they're just out there, running free? All the non-violent ones. You know... I know we haven't known each other for much time and I'm just a caretaker, but I like our talks. Me too. Oh, hi, Martha. This is my friend Jesus. I know who he is. Hi, Martha. It's been a while. Let's go, Sadie. Well, where are we going? You can stay with me. Oh, you need a place to stay, Sadie? You can stay here at the church. No, I think you'd be more comfortable with me, We have a couple of rooms in the back. Nice blow-up beds. I can blow up a bed for you. Okay. Well, if it doesn't work out, you're always welcome in God's house. Do you have any family or friends in law enforcement? No. Any friends you confide regularly in? No. Okay. Whatever happens out here, is between you and me. No one else can know. And nobody can know who I am. I've been running this business anonymously and without any problems since I was 11, and I want to keep it that way. Got it? Good. Depending on how this goes, I may be open to discussing profit splits. I have always believed I'd find the perfect assistant. Someone who would really understand what I do. I bury treasure for the lucky person who gets to it first. Every time, without a doubt, they compensate me in cash. We never meet, but we both win. It's the highlight of my day. God, thank you for today. Thank you, for Martha Plant. For her generosity, for our new friendship, in your name, Amen. Your water pressure is very powerful. I think you get cleaner that way. My mother made me take a lot of showers. We used to be just cold. That's why she had me take so many. Did someone teach you how to plant? No. I like it. Makes you feel like your worries kinda roll off. Because you remember how little you are. And how easy it would be to just pass away. I have another job. I work from home. So, if you want to be in the house while I'm doing that, it needs to be like you have a speech disorder, where you're unable to speak. Okay. What's the job? I sell air-conditioning units. That sounds like fun. It's not. Oh. - Good night. - Good night, Martha. Hello. Good morning, my name is Martha Plant. I'm calling to see if you're interested... ...a nd my brother just died, my husband has cancer, my son can't stop pissing the bed... Does this mean you don't want to buy an air-conditioning unit? Can you do me a favor, Martha? Yeah? Throw yourself off a cliff! - Hello? - Martha. Donald. - Hi. - Oh. How I miss that pleasant voice of yours. Do you have an inkling of why I'm calling? You need me to do better. Gonna need you to do more than that. Okay. It's not okay. You're just so bad. I know, I promised your parents I'd keep you on the roster when I bought the company from them, but I can't do charity work anymore. Now, I had you on salary for two years. Now, do you know how many units you've sold in that time? - Five. - Four. You sold four units. What do you want, Donald? If you don't sell 30 air-conditioning units in the next two weeks, you're fired. What? Mom, I know you wanted me to have this job, but I told you, I'm not good at this kinda stuff. Crap. What a tool. Trying to fire me... in front of my assistant. How embarrassing. Eureka. - Hello? - Good evening. My name is Martha Plant. I was calling to see if you were interested in staying extra cool this summer. No. Good evening. My name is Martha Plant. Wait, who is this? Martha Plant. I'm calling to see if you were interested in staying extra cool this summer. Oh, is this a sales call? Yes. My mother's father's sister, Thelma, died of heat exhaustion. The heat is real. I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you. That means so much. So... I make these calls because I want to make my imprint, you know, however small, if I could prevent a single premature death, I'll die happier knowing I did. You know, I didn't catch your name. What can I call you? I'm Judy. Judy Fine. - Hi, Judy. - Hi. Why, I'm so happy to meet you. Do you know anyone who's dies from the heat? My neighbor died of heat stroke. Like I said, the heat is real. You'd think our bodies could withhold a lot more but... We're so fragile and sacred. Ain't that the truth. Judy, do you have an air-conditioner? Your parents were really, really old when they adopted you. Yeah. They're dead now. Oh, I'm so sorry. Everybody's dead. My grandfather was shot in the head before I was born. Oh. That's so horrible. Who killed him? I don't want to talk about it. Okay. You can't really get to know a girl, speed dating. - Oh. - You need at least an hour, - face to face, to find out who she really is. - Whoa. - You see? - I see. - And today, you and her... - Jesus... Why do you keep locking this to your head? Ask Angie. - Who's Angie? - My friend. Is everything all right, Sadie? Who's Sadie? - What? - Who's Sadie? You're Sadie. I'm Emma. - Who's Emma? - I'm Emma. - Where's Sadie? - Who's Sadie? - You're Sadie. - I'm Emma. Who are you? Hello? Good morning, my name is Martha Plant. - How... - Oh, what kind of plant are you? - Excuse me? - I apologize. What? You have to stop talking. Why? Because I'm working. But you're on the phone. Exactly. Uh, ma'am? I'm selling air-conditioning units for a company called Clear Breeze. Hospital and Mental Health Center, my ass. Discharging a nut like her. If I had friends, I don't even know how I would describe her to them. And they wouldn't understand. Five, ten, 11, 12, 13... Good thing she's with me. I've always wanted a little sister. Emma, is there something you wanna tell me? No. Emma? Did you go to the bathroom in your dress? No. Yes. Yes, you did. You pooped your pants. Well, mommy says I'm not allowed to eat peanut butter. Then why did you eat the sandwich? Who's your best friend? I don't have a best friend. Why? I don't really relate. Why? I don't know. Mm. My best friend is really old. - Who's your best friend? - You. I'm not that old. How old are you? Like, two? Four. Are you a boy? Or a girl? I'm a girl. Oh. Is something wrong with the soup? It's green. Were you trying to kill yourself today? No. - Do you want to die? - No. Well, you almost did. You have to look both ways. I'm not going to do that again, Martha. Good. I have to tell you something about what happened yesterday. I'd appreciate that. I looked in one of your tins. Okay? I saw Jesus in your tin. What do you remember about yesterday? You boss told you you're pretty much gonna lose your job. Something wrong? Hello? Good morning, my name is Martha... I'm calling to see if you're interested in... Good morning, my name is Martha Plant and I'm calling to see if you're interested in staying extra cool this summer. Wait, what is this? I'm selling air-conditioning units. Yeah. Don't call here again! Elephants are apparently the most amazing mothers. Carrying their babies for 20 months inside their bellies. And they stay together for 16 years. Just like humans. I can't wait to have children. Well, sweetheart, it's exhausting but it's worth it. Oh, I bet. My eldest... Been a challenge, all right. The only thing he wants to date, is an accident. Hello? Hi. I'm Martha Plant. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? I'm fine. I'm calling to see if you're interested in staying extra cool this summer. What does that mean? We have a once in a lifetime special going on here at Clear Breeze air-conditioning. One unit now, for $199. What does it usually cost? About the same. Ah, okay. Okay, tell me about it. Its... It will cool the air. Well, what else? It's just an air-conditioning unit. I don't... I don't know. I mean, do you have, like a catalogue, you could send me or something? I like Pina coladas. Okay. I do. Do you? I mean, it's been a while. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay, what? I'll take it. You'll take what? The air-conditioner. Really? ♪ Why won't you have fun ♪ ♪ When it's easy ♪ To give up on my love ♪ When you tease me ♪ Can you run Little wave ♪ ♪ Would you need me ♪ I can't help but fall ♪ Destiny is calling ♪ Martha? Yeah? I saw something. Um, in a tin. It wasn't Jesus. That's good. It was Moses. He parted the sea and I was running through it. I was running as fast as I could. But I couldn't keep up with the Israelites... - Sadie? - Yeah? Did you talk to doctors at Bridges about this? I wasn't seeing anything then. I think you need to see someone. I think I'm receiving information. I think you're hallucinating. Something in your head is making this stuff up. I want to go see someone about this. - Who? - Jesus. Jesus is not a doctor. He's not a good person to talk to. Well then, I'll just go talk to God. Hello? - Hello, Mr. Cox, this is Martha... - Martha. Hi. I was calling to thank you for your purchase of our Clear Breeze air-conditioning system. It is shipped and should be arriving. Does it get old? - What? - You know, your spew. I don't say that line that much. Why not? I haven't sold a unit in months. You... you're funny. Thanks. When you say you saw Jesus, in the tin, you mean you just felt him, right? No. I could've touched him. And at first, I was so scared but... Now I feel like I'm supposed to be watching. Like, he's showing himself to me, the way he shows himself to you. It's not so visible, Sadie. I don't actually see Jesus or any of his word. I just feel him. I don't know what kind of person you are but I was walking down the aisle today. I was in this supermarket and I stopped and I... I didn't know what the heck I was doing there. Not in the crazy sense, but... Sometimes I wonder, what I'm doing. Like, really doing. Are you kidding me? What an insult. Like I'm gonna use a dirty toothpick. What are you doing? This is my favorite room. What are you doing here? What? In this house? I grew up here. Oh. So this was... I get it. It's cute. I didn't know you drink. Did you want some? So are we gonna get in the wagon? Not today. You should speak louder. What? Really? How dare you. - I don't know what you're... - I can't hear you. - I'm talking... - Speak louder. - I don't want to. - Do it. No! Who are you? I'm Angie. Where's Sadie? Sadie leaves when she's feeling bad. I'm Martha Plant. And I'm gonna admit it. The heat is real. Is it hot where you are? The weather? Yeah, it's pretty horrible. You're in the desert, too. I am. It's so hard talking to strangers, man. I sell these air-conditioning units so just thanks for listening. How about you? What's your name? Ma'am, for the third time, my name is Eric. What happened to you guys? We're from the rainbowfish family. Rainbowfish. It's a sex cult. We escaped. You're tough. Yeah. A lot tougher than Sadie. Too bad she gets all the screen time. Aren't I more equipped for the real world? The real world sucks. Yeah. She gets better, what happens to me? So when people ask what you do... Do you say you're a telemarketer or do you tell them you're like a... I'm a planter. - Right. - Yeah. Yeah. It's, like, totally odd. I mean, people actually pick your stuff up. It's insane. I mean, you should be proud. You're doing something really asinine and it's working. I think I wanna throw up. - Hello? - Good morning. - My name is Martha Plant. - Yes. "Yes" what? I will take it. Whatever you're selling. It's an air-conditioning unit. Yes. For $199. Yes, yes, yes. - Why? - I'm working on saying "yes" more in my life. This guy on the radio said the most successful people... You have different people living inside of you? I know. Really? Yeah. People at Bridges told me about them. Oh. Is there a way to get rid of them? They were trying to get us all to meet. If Jesus wants us to, we will. I had a pet possum, too. Really? He died at four. Oh. You know you're choosing cool when you choose Clear Breeze. Can't wait. Waffles during the summer can only be enjoyed during the cool weather. You make a good point. Hello? - Hi. - Hi, Martha. Uh, how are you? Apparently, you know? Here and there. How about you? It's been weird. Martha Poop. That's what they called me in school. Stinky cocks in your socks. That was mine. But pardon me. It's okay. Well... probably made you stronger, huh? Probably. ♪ I can see straight ♪ ♪ If I wanted to ♪ ♪ It's a sad day ♪ ♪ When I'm without you ♪ ♪ My... ♪ ♪ Nothing I can do ♪ It's like, I'm seeing God's word. Where I am with God.

I can't, I'm... - I'm not sure... - I just... I want to help you. I just need to understand more. What's the purpose of it? I mean, she makes a little money. I see. But, but it's more than that, it's... it's a really beautiful process and... It comforts her. Right. What? I believe... I believe you're seeing something. Oh. Good. But it's not him. What do you mean? Works of darkness, Sadie. I don't understand. I wouldn't open those tins no more. I don't think Martha has a good spirit around her. You what? No. No way. That's not gonna work for me. I'm broke down. I'm hungry, I... I'm in the middle of nowhere, man. Well, what am I going to do for four days? Suck my thumb? Richard?

We're best friends. Are you together? We've been together for about a week or so. I didn't know you were in a relationship. We're not. Oh. But you know this primordial towing company can't get a truck out here for a couple of days. If it's okay, I'll just need a ride to the closest motel. Okay. What about you? What do you do? Now, I have something new going. But it's just the beginning, you know. We make acupuncture needles for animals. I love needles. Yeah. It makes me happy. My mother... She died three days ago. She had necrotizing fasciitis. A flesh eating bacteria. I didn't know you were so... I didn't know you were so young, Martha. Well, you should stay here, you know. Until that truck can get your car back to San Diego. We'd love your company. Mm. Martha, what gave you the idea to put peanut butter on both sides of bread with a layer of jelly in between? It was an accident. Moment of spontaneity are so magical. Oh, I'm really glad we're all here. He put us together for a reason. Who? Jesus. Thanks for letting me crash, Martha. Yeah. I don't know when this towing company is going to get it together. But I can leave at any time. It's fine. I mean... no one else is using the couch. Right. Well... Thank you. I'm sorry, Richard. Goodnight. Goodnight, Martha. I gave them a perfectly good screwdriver and all they gave me back was nothing. Great. Unfortunately, Richard won't be able to fully grasp my process. I hear electric wheelchairs are all the rave right now. Really? The water pressure's very powerful, don't you think? You know, you get cleaner that way.

If I punched you in the face. My parents were decapitated in a car accident a year ago. I thought they were going to die in their sleep like normal people. I'm... I'm sorry, Martha. I knew they'd be dead soon, but I still locked myself in my room when they asked me to go to bingo. I kind of hate myself now. I hate myself, too. Hey. Morning. I'm sorry. It's fine. I had a dream I was on a ferry selling lemonade. And it was going well. I was selling a lot. Then I saw Carl. What did you like about him? I liked his hair. What do you like about him? Who? Richard. He' weird. I'll take it. Oh, I can't wait to wear my birthday suit all day. Pay me the... Who the hell is doing this to me? This is sabotage. This guy is sick! What kind of fre steals from a business like mine? I bet he's ugly and eats cheesy puffs for breakfast. Or maybe, they don't have much to give. Or maybe, they're new to the process. I doubt it. Maybe they're confused. I know I am. Confused about what? It's just a couple of dollars. It's not about the money. Maybe they're from out of town. Who cares. Maybe it's a joke. It's not funny. Well, maybe they're... Fucked up! Richard, this is Angie. Hi. How many are there? Three. Enjoying your vacation? - Uh-huh, yeah. - Yeah. You really like Martha, don't you? - Yeah. - Yeah. Feels good, huh? Yeah. What are you like, 70, 75? What? I mean, can you still get it up? My mother's dead. We know. I mean... We're sorry. I'm just waiting for the tow truck company. I think you're here for other reasons. Where you the one locking the helmet on Emma's head? What helmet? Why did you do that? Oh, it's like... It's like... Protection. If you had to be stuck in the closet with someone for the rest of your life, who would it be? Does it have to be a person? No. Then, my dead dog, Taco. Of all things you planted, what was your favorite? A taxidermy raccoon. Have you ever been in love, Martha? No. Why are you still alone? I don't know. I'm just... I'm never real comfortable, you know. And, uh... You kinda have to be. To be with someone. I got to tell you something, Martha. I like being on this side of things, I do. But it is a little tough listening to you, rather air conditioning calls. I mean... I get heavy in my heart. I can't get it out of my head, that maybe, maybe you talk to other people the way you talk to me. That I'm not that special. Can I confirm the spelling of your last name? Oh, sure. You look splendid, Richard. - Thank you, Sadie. - Your eyes are shining. You must be feeling better. I am. That's correct. Thank you. And you know you're choosing cool and you choose Clear Breeze Can you please pass the chalk? Sorry. Hm. This should pass. Where were you before Martha? I was in love. That's nice. Yeah. I think you would've liked Carl. You think she'll ever get over it? What? The tin stuff. - I hope not. - Why? Because if she never sees anything, then I really am crazy. ♪ I can't stand the heat ♪ ♪ Feel it in the way That you move ♪ ♪ I can't stand the heat ♪ ♪ Feeling it enough In your groove ♪ ♪ I can't stand the heat ♪ ♪ I don't know how you do What you do ♪ ♪ I can't stand the heat ♪ ♪ Having nothing all over you ♪ ♪ I can't stand the...

You call my husband that name and I'm gonna have you a boyfriend tonight. I swear. This guy is dead! He's dead to me! Watch me find him! Dead. Dead. Dead! Dead! Dead! Why would someone want to sabotage my business? I have no idea. I mean, it's one of the most successful enterprises in the area. - Oh, I know. - What? Someone would really do this out of jealousy? This is a real sicko! - Martha. - This is why I can't do people. - Martha. - What? - It just slipped. - What? But today, I saw him with a yellow screwdriver. - What? - I'm so sorry, Martha. - Please forgive me. - What are you talking about? I told Jesus about your planting! What? I told Jesus that you're the planter. Who's Jesus? Jesus! Martha! "Beware of false prophets "which come to you in sheep's clothing." Why're you stealing my plants, Jesus? Stay back, Sadie. The wolf plays ignorance. Hey. Put the bottle down, man. Stay away from my tins, Jesus. Everything in those tins is the work of the devil. Work of the devil? I knew you were a murderer. I didn't know you were a liar! - Murderer? - He robbed an old man of his life, when all he wanted was a strawberry milkshake. But he never got that milkshake and I never got my grandfather. Because you killed him! You killed her grandfather? I just shot the gun and it hit him. Why? No one was supposed to get hurt. I'd never held a gun before. I've thought about that moment every day since I was 19. I don't know where you come from, but I came from a trashcan. And I've made something of myself. I'm the planter and you're not gonna take that away from me. Now I know why you're doing what you're doing. You're making Sadie think I was talking to her. But don't make her pay for my sins. That's why you've been stealing my plants? You think I'm putting Jesus in my tins? Well Jesus hasn't actually been in all the tins. I have no idea what's going on. I haven't stolen anything, Martha. I've done enough sin in this life. Martha? Everything okay? We'll find out who it is, Martha! 7:30 a.m. breakfast. 8:00 a.m. departure. We're gonna get this guy. Richard. - Your lip is twitching. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh. I'm nervous too. I'm not nervous. We need to be prepared for anything. There are real freaks out there. Yeah. It's a good thing you have me. Yeah. I mean, have you ever thought of what could happen out there? A little. We need weapons. Okay. Well, we have a shovel. A shovel won't stop someone with a gun. Oh, you're right. - What should we do? - We'll bring these. Now, a knife... For obvious reasons. Put a fork in the eye. That'll blind them. Now I don't like blood either, especially if it's coming from the face. Well I don't wanna use a fork. Mommy always taught me to use my hands. Okay. Use your hands. You look good. What if we miss them? What do you mean? What if they come at night? They gotta do it at night. I mean, it would be too easy during the day. Too... too easy to get caught. It'd be hard to find the coordinates at night. Not if they had a flashlight. Oh. Mommy says I'm not supposed to put things in my mouth, Richard. You're right, sweetie. It's a bad habit. What? What? You put the toothpick in my tin. What toothpick? You've been taking my plants. Oh. Martha. It was you. You've got it all wrong. You're way off track here. I'm off track? Yeah, yeah, you are. - Oh my God. - Martha! A couple of days after I started talking to you, - I got my first empty tin. - What're you talking about? How would I even know about your planting business? Everybody knows. My flyers have been coveted for years. You're not making any sense. So you hit a squirrel and ran into a lamp post. Come on! That fat rodent destroyed my car! I can't believe I let you stay with us! Is your mother even dead? I have to tell you something, Martha Plant! Oh, it's this day you're gonna tell me the truth? Yeah. Yeah, I am. - Then say it! - Here I go! - Go for it! - I love you, Martha Plant! What is she doing? What're you doing? How does it feel, Martha? Hm? How does it feel to know that the thief has been shitting in your toilet all along? I mean, you picked some pretty weird places to plant shit and it's not easy getting there in the middle of the night... when you're drunk. But I did it. And I thought you should know. I took care of you. Martha, it's just not working out. Look at you. You're choking me. Why? Why did you do it? I like to keep things interesting. No! Tell my why! Self-preservation! - You're sick. - You're sick. It's just a tin with junk in it. If you kill me, you kill Sadie too. If you care at all about Sadie, you'll tell her to forever stay the hell away from me. - Hello? - I'm Martha Plant and I'm calling because the heat is real. When it gets too hot outside, those beautiful flowers, they die. That's kind of what happens to your insides when you overheat. Do you know the one thing... The one thing in this Earth that won't let you down? Our Clear Breeze air conditioning system. Because if you let yourself be susceptible to all the freaks out there, you don't know where you'll be. Alone? Maybe. Is it that bad though? Being alone? You hear that? That's a drumroll. That's giving you ten seconds to make your decision on whether you're gonna buy a Clear Breeze air conditioning system. I'm waiting. The drums are playing for you. This is the time to be cool. Because Clear Breeze is offering you a once in a lifetime special... I'm here to help you. It's up to you. Help you, help me help you. Melt in the heat if you'd like. Become a puddle of sweaty... I'm gonna be honest here. More honest than I've ever been with anyone before. I'm about to lose my job. Don't hang up that phone. Do not hang up that phone. We only have a limited time on this planet. Why waste it in pain and misery? Are you sitting by your purse right now? How hot is your hand? Sweaty? Disgusting? 'Cause all you have to do is... Zip! ...open up your purse and tell me, "Martha, "I want to buy an air conditioning unit!" Hello? Martha. Donald. - Hi. - I don't know exactly what you did, but it worked! You've sold all 30 air conditioners. - Yup. - It was a shock to me and I am sure it was a shock to Enoch... So it looks like we'll be flying you down to headquarters first class, Martha! You can teach everyone here the mysterious ways of Ms. Martha Plant! Pack your bags. It's showtime! West Texas is a really lovely place and I'm sure people will love to meet the notorious and famous, most excellent Martha Plant! Thank you for your help. I sold all the air conditioning units. Oh! That's great. They wanna fly me down to headquarters. Wow. That's a real big deal. I've never been on an airplane before. Me either. I hear they give free snacks. I thought you never wanted to see me again. How did you know that? Angie. We made a deal. I told her she could stay as long as she stops stealing your plants. I guess she was donating them all to the church. I'm glad you met. Yeah. She's not a very nice person. If it were the apocalypse, and I could only save one thing, I'd save my assistant.
