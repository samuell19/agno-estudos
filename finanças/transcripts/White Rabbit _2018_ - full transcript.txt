[Music playing] [Exhaling forcefully] [Echoing] Can you hear me? [In Korean accent] I come to America nine years ago with my two boys and a husband, five and seven years old. We come to America because we believe America to be place where dream come true. Work hard and you can make it. So my husband and I, we work very hard. Sixteen-hour days, seven days a week, no holidays, no weekends, and we do this every day for about two years until we finally save enough money to buy our own store. But when we buy our own store, we work even more because it's just us. We never see our children. I miss my boys so, so much, but I call them every day after school. My husband, he reminds me why I work so hard in support my children's education-- my children education in the future. [Music playing] [Panting] - [Dog barks] - [Train horn blows] [Music continues] [Music stops] [Sighs] [Exhales] [Woman speaking Korean on phone] [Man speaking Korean on phone] [Beeps] [Crunches] [Sighs] [Woman] No, I talked to him about the price. I talked to him about the price twice. It's just that, like-- I don't know, I?m just in a totally different headspace right now. Like, I?m a mother and I have a kid and it's really intense and these are people who I feel like don't even know what skin-to-skin contact is. They probably think it's some form of, like, ultra thin condom or something. Like, they're just not my people right now. [Knock on door] - Hello? Hey. - Hi. - Can I help you? - I?m Sophia. Oh. Oh, I?m the task rabbit. - Oh, yeah. - You said you needed help with reorganizing or... Okay, come in. Sorry. Yeah, no problem. Oh, shoes on or shoes off? If you can take them off, yeah, that would be great. Where do you want me to-- can I put my shoes? Um, you know what? You can just put them right here. - Okay. - Just put them-- - Um, okay, that's fine. - Is that--? Okay. Um, so... the baby's toys are a real disaster right now, and he's just starting preschool and I really want him to start focusing, and so I was thinking of the best thing to do-- I mean, do you have kids? - No, I don't have kids. - No, okay. So, it's fine. Um, I just really want the toys to be focused based on their objective. You know what I mean? So the bottom shelf should be toys with wheels that go in a specific direction, and the middle shelf could be musical instruments that you blow. Oh, yeah, so you just want them organized, like, per their function. Yeah, yeah, and then, like, maybe you could even take it a step further. I mean, I know your-- On your profile it says you're, like, super organized. - That's awesome. - Yeah. So you could do something where maybe they're organized by size or by color, too. Just-- I really want to just get his brain stimulated. - No, yeah, I get it. Yeah, no problem. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay, all right. Um, and then also there's this weird spot right here. If you could just do this while you're doing that, that would be great. - I just... - Oh, I don't-- I?m, um-- You just spray it and just let it sit. - You know what? Sure. - Okay, thank you. I actually-- I?m not, like, a cleaner. That's okay, though. You don't have to be. - It's really easy. - I'll just spray it and let it sit. You just spray it. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Nice to meet you. [Playing discordant notes, babbling] Hello. Hi. Wow. Who are you? Emmanuel. Oh, you're Emmanuel. I like your toys. Can I ride on your back like a pony? You want to what? Ride on your back like a pony. You want to ride on my back like a pony? - Um... - [Playing discordant notes] [Babbling] So... Okay. - Was that like a pony? - [Babbles] Um, Alice? Alice? Fuck! Fuck! Hi, this is Sophie, your task rabbit. I?m sorry, um... I-- This is so crazy, but I?m just gonna be, like, a few minutes late. Hello? Does anyone have a bike, a white bike, that's parked on the corner? Hey, is that your bike? Yeah. What-- what the fuck? It's not cool. You locked your bike against mine. - You didn't see that? - I?m sorry. - I?m so sorry. - What the fuck? I missed my job because of you. I was supposed to digitize this guy's high-8 tapes and now I?m like an hour late. Didn't you even, like, check? I didn't. Just-- Can you just, like-- Whoa! Sorry. You just dropped my bike. You know that, right? Yeah, well, fuck that. Fuck you! No, fuck you! Fuck! [Groans] [Music playing] - Ethan? - Yeah, hi. - Hey. - Sophia, nice to see-- Hey, nice to-- Nice to meet you. - Come on. - Um... I got, um, coffee. Oh, you ordered for me? - Yeah. - That's so nice. - It's-- It's cool. - I don't drink coffee, though. - Okay. - Thank you. - Well, then I'll drink two. - I feel bad. - No, that's okay. Don't worry. - Thank you. Sorry. But I?m so happy that you came to meet me today and I wanted to talk to you because I saw your stuff on YouTube... - Oh, which piece? - ...and it blew me away. The supermarket piece. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God. You know, if I?m not gonna get, you know, my voice in the institutions, then I?m just gonna take this corporate grocery store and make it-- turn it into my stage. - Yeah. - Yeah, and, so, that was really fun. I see you as this incredibly powerful Asian American woman. - Thanks. - Yeah. [Chuckles] And, uh, your-- You-- I was not-- Your accent is incredible. You sound totally American. - Oh-- - You know, it's just in the-- In the-- In the piece you, um-- I guess you were doing your-- Yeah, I was, like, impersonating... - Yeah. - ...a character from the past. Yeah. - It's a-- It's a-- Yeah. - So, she was an immigrant, - But I-- Yeah. - Right, right, right. So, I have this film and there's an incredibly powerful role for an Asian American woman in it. And when I saw you doing your work, I thought you just were the part. If you want to know about it, it's about a social media conglomerate, and you would play a character who has a very powerful role in the accounting department of this conglomerate. And it's, like, such a-- I?m not sure if I could really embody that because I?m not really good with math. You're not gonna be crunching numbers onscreen. That would be so boring. - I know, but... - It's about your dynamic. - ...I?m not sure that I could-- - It's your dynamic with this head guy, - And so-- - Wait, so the movie's about her? No, no, the movie is about him. - Okay. - And what he's doing in the world right now. But this is such an important counterpoint - so that he knows that, a... - You said-- You said-- ...there are strong, intelligent women in the work force that he needs to respect, and that they are of, you know, many different backgrounds. - And that's what you would encapsulate. - But didn't you-- Didn't you say it was, like, just a couple of lines? Yeah, it's a couple of lines. It's a very small scene, but it's very important. Okay, I mean, I?d have to read the script. I don't know in what context, but how could just, like-- I mean, sorry, I don't know that-- This much about your world... - Right. - But how-- I?m not sure that in such a few lines, you could get all of that across. Because you're talking about-- it's not about the words. I look at you and all I see is strength and will and determination, and that's all that I want you to bring to this piece is that energy. [Music playing] [Woman singing in foreign language] What I didn't understand was why was this injustice then redirected at Korean Americans? Why were the rioters mostly targeting and burning down Korean stores? Over 2,000 Korean businesses were destroyed, targeted, looted, burnt down during the L.A. riots. And then at the same time, the L.A. media was constantly creating and publishing ready-made racial tension by reporting on all the black crimes on Korean stores and violence. Black crimes on Korean stores and violence. Repeatedly. For every robbery, they would always mention that the store was owned by Korean-born and that the criminal was black, even if race had nothing to do with the crime. [Imitating Korean accent] After city tried to rebuild, they all take away our liquor license. Because liquor license, they have to be active for 30 days. If not active, they took away. They say, "unless it act of God like earthquake or earth-- or rainstorm, is not active." Huh? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, how is massive burning of your store not an act of God, huh? I not plan, huh? I not do, I not. Oh, Hananim, why city punish the victim, huh? Why city take away our voice? We have no political power. We have no voice. Oh, Hananim, oh, Hananim... [Speaking Korean] Oh, Hananim, oh, Hananim. Hey. [Normal accent] Hey. Why are you talking about the riots? Um, hi. You don't recognize me, right? Um, we-- We... It must be, like, my costume. We had, like, a thing two days ago. - You-- Your bike. - You. - Yeah. - You. - I?m so sorry, actually-- - You are fucking crazy. I know. I actually-- I was thinking about you, because that's not really me. That's not who I am. I just-- You caught me in a really, like-- Wait, so you went so fucking nuts on me and now you're here talking about politics? - Like, I?m... - Well, I?m an artist, and I?m just-- yeah, I?m doing this performance here because I feel like it's a marginalized part of history, untold history, that I wanted to revisit because it really reflects our current state right now. - Do you think...? - I mean, were you here during the L.A. riots? - No, I wasn't. - Yeah, well, neither was I. But I know that-- You know, I was doing a lot of research and, like, I was just a kid. Somehow the Koreans were taking this blame for, you know, all, like, sort of the racial tensions go-- you know, happening. - And I just-- - Yeah, well, the woman shot-- I mean, she shot the 15-year-old girl in the back. That's not what my piece is about. I?m trying to explore that the media sort of took that footage and kind of-- They're manipulating the people to kind of sort of misdirect all the real issues. I feel like if we had real dialogue and if we could really talk about these issues, we would know that we're, like, actually connected and that we all want peace. Okay, well, I hear you talking, and this is not dialogue 'cause you're doing all the talking and I?m just-- If you want to have a proper dialogue, I want to talk to you about this because I find you so interesting, and you being here. But I feel like you're talking at me, you're not listening to me. - So... - Yeah, sorry. - It's okay. - I?m sorry, I just-- You know, we had that thing and then I?ve had some other, like, friends of mine who are very dear friends, like, you know, attack me and say that it was kind of like anti-black and blackness. - And-- - Are you anti-black? - No, of course not! - Okay, good. Course-- Are you kidding? Like, my best friends are, like-- yeah, like, whatever. - No. - What I thought was interesting is how you embodied your culture. The voice, the empathy, the love, the understanding. That came from a very truthful place. - Uh, thank you. - I appreciate that. I?m so sorry that I came at you. It's just been a really hard time. Like, everyone's-- every time I look in the news, - there's another person being shot... - Yeah. ...there's another person being pulled down the street, and I?m just so-- I?m just-- That's exactly what I?m trying to draw attention to. - Me, too. - Yeah, so we're trying to do the same thing. - I think-- - It's cool, it's cool, girl. Like, fucking, keep doing what you're doing. What's your name? - I?m Sophia. What's yours? - Sophia. I?m Victoria. - Victoria. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - See you around. - Yeah. - 'Kay. bye. - Thanks for-- Thanks for coming to talk to me. You know, I really appreciate that. Thank you. We're just trying to understand, right? Yeah. Yeah. - Peace. - Bye. [Music playing] [Woman singing in foreign language] [Horn honking] [Music continues] Go around. Fuck. What the fuck is the matter with these people? Just go around. [Music continues] [Music stops] [Phone beeps] [Coughs] [Crinkling on video] [Laughs] [Music playing] # Who watched the dog? # # Lost in the fog # # Squat down below # # Jump to the snow # # Coyote call... # I don't know, I-- Like, it made sense to text you. - Uh-huh. - And then as soon as I did it, - I was like, "no." - [Laughs] "Bring back the text! Bring it back!" Um, yeah, so I just wanted to see you because, um... I don't know, I just, um-- I keep thinking about you, you know. Okay. Uh-huh. I mean, I know-- I know it's been a while. Um... And, uh, I don't know. I just-- I was, like, curious about how you were and... I-- Like, what happened, you know? 'Cause I... With us? Yeah, what happened? I mean... I just always felt like there was no-- Like, we-- like, day to day-- Day to day, I loved being with you. And I loved you. I just felt like the priority was always, like, your work, which was always pulling you in, like, all these crazy directions and I was just kind of like-- felt like I was always here for you, but, like, where was I being seen? I mean, we were living together. We, like, you know-- We made all these compromises together. We were like a team. I mean, absolutely. But it just felt like... And then, like, I don't know, like, out of the blue you're, like, gone. You're, like, not-- You're not, like... - I mean, honestly, when I... - ...accessible to me. I don't doubt that you, like, cared about me. I always knew that you did, and you always made it super clear. But do you remember when I went to visit my mom? Is that what this is about? Because you never-- You never said that. Of course I would've been there for you. I, like, love you. Of course I would've been there, but you ever asked me. For me, really, it just comes down to, like... I don't know. Maybe it was, like, the time-- Like, the moment that we were together. I mean, some couples, like, have their moment and then it's over. I just remember, like-- I don't know, I just remember, like, you holding me and telling me that... you know, that you, like, want to be... [Sniffles] That, like, we were home. [Feedback squeals] [Sophia on microphone] Hello? Can you hear me? So, in 1992, I was just a kid. I didn't really understand what was happening. Every time I turned on the news, I?d hear about some Korean grocer getting shot by black Americans or some rappers rapping about how racist Koreans are. So I asked my parents, "What's going on? Why do black people hate us so much?" And then I remember at the time, my best friend was black, Mikita Jackson. I, like, loved her, and I thought we were so close, but when all of this was happening, I couldn't even talk to her or admit to her that I was having all these awkward feelings. I don't know. I mean, like, you know. I?m, like, at the restaurant like seven days a week. - Oh, my God. - I make no money. I cannot work. I can't work a restaurant job. They would pay me not to come to the restaurant, I?m such a bad waitress. - I don't know. - Oh, man. They don't tell you in art school you have to, like, marry rich or whatever. Yeah, that's what they should teach in art school. - Marry rich. - How do you trap the spouse - that's gonna be making the money? - Support your artwork. The only people I know who, like, are continuously making work are the people whose, like, husbands or wives are making... - Yeah, or you come from money, right? - ...any money, yeah. Like, are we just making work for our friends here? We're just, like, being privileged bitches who, like, had, I don't know, somehow got lucky and went to art school and now we're, like, jacking off into the art circle? - Like, masturbating? - No. Like everyone's in a fucking circle jerk? Is it just, like, self-indulgent to, like, be like, "okay, I can still be an artist" today when the world's, like, going crazy. I don't know. I have to-- I have to make stuff. If I don't make performances or if I don't-- If I don't find, like, a way to express myself, like, I'll go insane. We've looked at this from every angle. We can't pull the trigger on the initiative. - That's great. - Yeah. - That was great. - Okay, great. Yeah, how'd that feel? - Um... - The-- Yeah. - Yeah, you're making a stand. - Yeah, yeah, I felt like-- Um, sorry? You're making a stand. - Right. - Yeah. Would it be more helpful for you if you said it in, like, your native... dialect? What do you mean, my native dialect? Like in the YouTube spot. - Oh, no, that's not my-- - Yeah. English is my native dialect. I was just putting on that character for... You want me to put, like, an Asian character-- - Yeah, do you want to do that? - I mean, Asian accent on this? Do you want to, like, try that? Um, no. No. I just feel as though... [Voice breaks] I just feel as though that would be so powerful, to hear that voice... come through at that time. I don't understand what her being, like-- Having an accent has anything to do with, like... She has had to overcome so much with her family and her history in this country, and now she's actually been given a voice in a company that has an economy, like, the size of Morocco. So this is a huge moment for her, and I think it would be so powerful if she was saying it-- If she spoke in, like, broken English because just speaking English is a challenge for her. That wasn't really in the script. It didn't say anything-- She wasn't a foreigner in this company. No, but you're not a foreigner. - You just-- - But you're making her a foreigner. You're making her the other. Why does she have to have an accent? That doesn't make any sense to me. I don't understand what "the other" is. What is "the other"? Why does she have to have an accent? - She's, like-- - So, you won't try that? No. I feel terrible that I?ve made you uncomfortable. [Voice breaks] I?m sorry, I?m having a hard time right now. [Sniffles] I mean... I?m sorry. You're just so lucky... that you have this thing, this, um... This heritage and this power to speak and you have actually something meaningful to say. I just-- I feel like my life is meaningless, you know... - I?m sure you have meaning in your life. - ...in comparison. It's kind of like what you make of it. No, everything has been handed to me on a plate. - What? - Everything has been handed to me on a plate. I?ve struggled for nothing in my life. Oh, I?m sorry, I?m not gonna feel sorry for you 'cause everything's been handed to you. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I gotta-- I gotta go. - I don't want you to-- - I was just trying to be open-minded. - I was like, why don't I try something? - I don't want this. I don't want this to be the experience you had. It's-- I... You know, I got all up in my own shit - and it's not, um... - It's okay, dude. Like, I tried it. It didn't-- I know, I just don't want you to leave here feeling, like, icky or anything like that. No, I don't feel icky. I mean, I do, but, like, that's cool. It's just some stuff came up for me - and I just-- No, I just-- - No, it's cool, we all-- - No, hey. Sorry. - Oh. I just, um-- Cool. Bye.

[Man singing in Spanish on radio] So, tell me about you. What's your story? I mean, what-- Are you from Los Angeles? No, I?m from Ghana, West Africa. - You know that? - Oh, wow. Course. Wow. So, when did you come here? I?ve been here for, like, 10 years. - Wow. Okay. - Yeah. What about you? Where are you from? Actually, I was born in Korea. Yeah. When did you move here? I moved when I was seven. Yeah, I learned my English watching John Hughes films when I was seven. That's why I talk like a permanent teenager. - [Laughs] - That's how I learned to-- - That's so amazing. - That's why I have this permanent, like, valley girl accent. I speak like Molly Ringwald, basically. - Oh, my God, I love that. - She created me. That's so awesome. You know how I learned English? - How, what? - Watching "Friends." - No, that's even worse! - I know. Between the two of us, we're speaking Pop Americana. # Trying to get to know you. # Ah-ah, oh. [Both laugh] Sorry, I?m so weird. You're funny. - Um... - Have you been back since? Yeah, I?ve been back, but I still wouldn't, like, identify myself with, like, being Korean. You know, it's funny, this immigrant life 'cause you're not, like, fully a Korean and you're not fully American, so you're this hyphenated American. So, what do you do here? I?m a photographer. Mm. I?ve been photographing since I was 16. Yeah. When I came to America, I realized there wasn't-- There weren't that many pictures of me growing up, and so I think I became a photographer because it was my own way of cataloguing my life, you know, and archiving myself. Great job. I mean, I get it. - Thank you. - I think that's beautiful. I?ve never heard-- you know, it's true. I think... It's like "I was here," right? [Music playing] [Traditional Korean music playing] Come with me. It's kind of like appropriating identity and, I don't know, I love it. [Growls] The Earth Mother catches her children in the net, and they fly away. [Squeals] Shh. Your-- feet is tied with a rock and you're on the ocean.

[Smooches] - Hi. - Thank you for having us. [Music playing, chattering] I know. So this is all I based on the harvest. Wow. Installation. [Chattering indistinctly] Which one are you?

'Cause sometimes we-- Yeah, that's the part that I need some help with. 'Cause I don't have balance in my life. Self-help books, Eckhart Tolle, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Oprah. No, do you read a lot? - Got you. I got you. - No. Are you serious? What are some of the, like-- What would be, like, the... God, you make me sound like I?m some kind of guru. I don't know. I don't have any advice. I don't know, you seem so balanced. [Hums, laughs] There's, like, a really beautiful, like, quality about you. You're just so, like, grounded and earthy. I like your vibe, too. I feel like you're close to mine in that way, too. - You know? - Really? - Totally. I do. - You like my vibe? I think that's probably why the universe keeps making us run into each other - in this big-ass fucking town. - I know. Like, to see you again is like, whoa. I just-- I feel, like, so, I don't know... calm. Aw. - Good. I?m glad. - Yeah? I love this so much. This is so nice. [Music playing] [Quacking] I didn't realize I was gonna be modeling today. I would've, uh... Like that, hold it, hold it. - Yes. - ...gotten in shape. You're the perfect subject for this. No, you should be in pictures. You look fantastic. Do you always wear that outfit when you take photos? - Yes. - 'Cause I think you should. This is my studio. I can wear whatever the fuck I want. You look amazing. - Shake it off. - Okay. - Shake your head. - Shake it off. - Okay, you got this. - # Shake it off, shake it off # And now we can do a breathe. Like one breath. Oh, my God. Sophia. You fucking killed it. - You're so good. - I didn't do anything. Tell me about this work. What-- What inspires you? I don't know. I try to create a space for-- in my work-- where women can come. It's a space where it's, like, nurturing and truthful, where they can really sort of, like, be themselves so I can really capture their essence. Yeah, but, you know, your work is so personal that all of these pictures of these women, they actually all remind me of you. That's what I find so liberating about you. You're just so free and I?m so analytical and I?m always, like, over-thinking and I have, like, my inner critic. Blah. And you're just-- I don't know, you're so free. I think all women should feel free. You know, this is-- our body-- Our bodies are our vessel. It's how we move through the world, and it's sad that society's made us ashamed of our bodies. - You're not ashamed. - Fuck no, bitch. You're not ashamed of a thing. With all my flaws. I?m just gonna scrub the fuck out of my skin till I get all these dead cells out. What are your parents like? Oh, lovely. - Are they pretty, like, understanding? - They're African parents. So imagine your Korean parents. How are they? Oh, my mom-- They're all, like, my inner critic. I don't need an inner critic 'cause I just have my mom's voice like, "You're not good enough. This is not good enough." - What about you? - Oh, you're so sad. Well, what I hear from my mom is like, "You should get a real job. You should get a husband. You should settle down." She doesn't like you doing pictures? No, she doesn't understand it. But it's okay. I think our parents, especially our mothers, they didn't have the freedom that we have. as the modern woman, we get to have children later on. That's what I try to do in this work, but, actually, speaking of work, I?m actually going to New York next week. New York City. Cheers. - Cheers, salud. - Salud. [Music playing] Why do you think Koreans were targeted? Oh, it's very hard to say. It's not just one thing that leads to an event like this. Creating ready-made racial tensions. Economic recession. Globalization. They're the new pioneers. [Music playing] Hey, Victoria. It's Sophia. I just woke up. I think it's like-- I don't know, like, noon over there. I just wanted to say hi. I miss you. I can't wait till you're back. [Pop music playing] Hey, Victoria. It's Sophia. I left you a message a couple of days ago. I just wanted to make sure that you got it. And if not, I was kind of groggy when I left it. Anyways, I just wanted to hear your voice. I wanna know how New York is. I don't know. I?m just curious about what you're up to. So just give me a call or text me. Yeah, let me know you're okay. Okay, bye. Now, is it the same photographs? Is this one of signs? 'Cause I know about signs. I know you know signs. You bought three of them. You bought three of my photos. Well, I was also born under one. I was born under the Hollywood sign, right under the letters L and Y. - Wow. - Yeah, literally. - Hollywood baby. - Hollywood baby. What are you doing in New York? Whether it's art or filmmaking, you come to New York. You come to New York to show your work. So I know about that. - And that's why you're here. - [Phone chiming] You're here. What other places have you shown your work at? Dusseldorf? Paris? Okay, okay. I think that the most-- You may have some of the most important work you've done. Sharon has to get picked up by a certain person who has demands that she show up at her house. Yeah, we're gonna go eat. We should go eat dinner at Botanica. I heard it's really good. I heard it's really cute inside. - Oh, I can't-- - Should I just uber to her house? [Woman] She buys less stuff. So laying her off, Nordstrom is making less money 'cause she's, like, not shopping as much. Yeah, she doesn't need to get a job. She still goes to Nordstrom like every other day. [Muffled chattering] [Overlapping chattering] [Woman] Are you okay? What's wrong? Sorry, I gotta-- I gotta take this off. I gotta-- Can I take this off? - Can you help me? - Yeah. I felt like she really got me, and I, like, understood her. It was-- You know, I just feel like, maybe I shouldn't be so open because every time I?m open, I just get my heart broken, and I feel like such a fool. What do you think would help you move from this place? I don't know. Like validation for my work would be amazing. Yeah. Maybe and that has to do with money. I don't even know what I?m thinking, actually. I just-- I miss her so much and I?m just really so stupid. - [Sobbing] - Oh, no. So how about we take a moment and just not think about this for a second, but I just have to get to the task rabbit job that I had you come over to do, because I?m getting charged, and I just-- I hope maybe this will help you a little bit - 'cause the shed is a mess... - Oh, my God, yes, of course. so I really need your help today. Just take care of that. Of course. No, I?m here for you. Okay. All right. - No, I?m sorry. - Okay, let's go. - What is it that you-- - It's right back here. - Sorry. - That's okay. That's okay. You think it might be a good idea? - To tell her that I have a boyfriend? - Mm-hm. You're my man. You have nothing to worry about. So, I mean, are you kinda into her at all? - No. - No? Not even a little bit? - [Knocking on window] - Holy shit. Who's this? Fuck. - What the fuck? - I thought you were back in town. Why haven't you returned any of my texts? I went out of town and I?m just-- I know, but you could've texted me back, like, to just tell me that you were alive. - Did I do something wrong? - No, you're my friend. - We had a really nice time. - Are you mad at me? - I?m not mad at you. - Did something happen? - I?m just trying to do my life. - No, I know. I thought we had something, or am I-- - I?m sorry. - That's my boyfriend. He's my friend-- my boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? Victoria, don't make me look like an idiot. - I mean-- - We had a nice time. - It was great. - No, I know. - What the fuck? - I?m just-- I?m sorry. Like, "What the fuck"? What the fuck? You what the fuck! - You have a boyfriend. - Hey, what's going on? - Listen, dude, I?m not talking to you. - Baby, don't... - Can you just step away? - That's cool. I?m talking to her. I?m talking to Victoria. Can you just step away? You just seem really intense right now. Will you fucking get rid of him? You're making me feel like such an idiot. What? This is too much for me, this constant texting. And Facebook and fucking Instagram. Do you think I would've pursued you - if I thought you had a boyfriend? - Pursued? - I?m not an idiot. - You're my friend. You know you're not just my friend. You're fucking being so crazy right now. - Just chill. You're my friend. - Get away from me. Just-- Don't fucking touch him. Don't touch him. What are you-- Oh, my God! What the fuck are you-- Hey! Fuck you! Okay, stand the fuck back. - You're fucking crazy. - Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck! What the fuck? [Microphone feeds back] - [Amplified] Fuck you. - You bit him. - Fuck you. - You bit him. You guys are parasites of the earth. Fuck-- Fuck off. Is this, like, hilarious-- Fuck off, Victoria, you two-timing cunt. You fucking bitch! Fuck. Fuck you! It's my fucking coffee. [Chanting in foreign language] [Speaking foreign language] [Sighs] Umma. Sophia, so glad to talk to you. I haven't heard from you for a while. - Uma. - Hm? What is it? I don't know what I?m doing. I?m just wasting my life. Did you break up with a boyfriend or something? What's going on? Huh? Did somebody... ...break your heart? You're doing a great job, and I am right because I?m your mother. No, I?m not. You are always talented in your paintings, in your sculptures. You're an artist. Uma, I don't make sculptures. What do you mean, you don't make sculptures? I make things that you can't sell. I make things that you can't sell, Uma. Then who are you making it for, whatever you're making? I don't know. It's okay. Somebody someday is going to appreciate what you're making even though you're not selling it. [Speaking foreign language] You worked so hard and you always had so many more obstacles than me, you and dad, and I just-- I wanna thank you and I wanna thank you for always supporting me no matter what crazy, crazy stuff I wanted to do. Just, thank you so much. And I?m going to be a little bit busy so I won't be able to call you, okay? But don't worry. Remember to take care of yourself. - I will. - Crazy stuff but take care of yourself. - Okay, I will. - And eat. Bye. I love you. - Bye, Uma. - Bye bye. [Typing on keyboard] I know that saying I overreacted is an understatement. We had such fun together, right? And I think I did kind of misconstrue or-- I don't know. I feel like every time I come across something that I start to really love, I just-- I wanna hold onto it and make it mine or... I just wanna grasp it because I already worry about losing it. I have a lot of Han. Do you know what that is? - No. - It's like Koreans have a lot of Han. We have a lot of inner demons, a lot of inner anger that's just ready to come out. - Anyway... - I left just for a week. I was gone only a week, and you were just, like... not getting the hint. I?m sorry that I bit your boyfriend. Yeah, I?m sorry, too. And I?m sorry that I misread all the signals. I think I just got really excited because a lot of my friends that I?ve had, they sort of turn this other path that I don't really recognize. You know, it's really hard to make new friends as adults, and I just instantly just-- I, like, loved you. That was rad. That was connection, right? Yeah. That was great. We had so much fun. Yeah. You know that Osho quote... about love? If you love a flower, you don't pick it. That's how you know love. Anyway, it's all good. I won't pick your flower. Yeah, don't pick my flower. Just let me bloom, girl. Over 100,000 people showed in the march for peace. Unity and support from all over Southern California. It is here that we attracted the mainstream media of our plight.
