(LOCKED IN SOCIETY) going to drink that!? You're not Oh, but I am. A staff room coffee Nothing beats that's sat 6 or 7 hours on the hotplate. Combined with delicious oat milk, this bitumen-like substance becomes a full-fledged latte. From a food-chemistry perspective... BERND: Let him poison himself if he wants to. It's for the nerves. It's not poison, a stack of exams by 5. I have to correct No, I... Do it at home. Speaking of which, I got to go. Pleasant weekend, adieu and see you. One second. What? Something to discuss. We have I beg to differ. I've got to get home, shower, eat, and get to my wife's store. If I'm not behind the counter by 3:30, it'll be the last Friday of my life, predilection for Fridays. And that despite my You parked in my space again this morning. Oh, it's yours? Your own personal parking space? I didn't see a sign. I wasn't aware, Don't act dumb. Don't bother, Klaus. He's not acting. Particularly from you! That hurt, There are rules at this high school, Mr. Mertens. Near the entrance has been mine The parking space since Dr. Clausen retired. Eleven years ago, Mr. Mertens. Have abided by that. All our colleagues Yeah... Phew... I really like the spot. The school quick, You get into and more importantly back out again! So, nice talking to you. Hasta luego, muchachos. You're an oaf! Have a nice weekend. And what's more, I'm off! That was a knock. We all heard it. Who could it be? Who cares? There's one thing I can't stand, I hope it's not a student. If it's students at 2:30. Students at 10:30 are no better. On the door since forever: There's been a notice Students are unwelcome in the staff room. Yet they're a daily occurrence. This is a school. It's almost like The staff room is reserved as a place of retreat and preparation. Grubby senior lounge couch. I don't hunker down on the Maybe you should. To get closer to your students. That's the last thing I want. There it goes again. Maybe it's just a woodpecker. If we just ignore it, maybe it'll go away. Or we just open it. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Who are you, anyway? Sara Schuster. For Biology and English. Trainee teacher I've already introduced myself. Trainees come and go. Is the job description. Trainee Teacher They come and go, too. Are you one of those modern feminists, Miss Schuster? To be addressed correctly. It's Ms., I want I recently had a student who wanted me to use her chosen pronoun. According to "them," I'm now to refer to her as "they." What the heck? It offers no improvement in scientific terms. As non-binary chemistry. There's no such thing But we could still discuss it among the staff. Providing... "staff" is inclusive. Right? Before the tension kills us all. Somebody better get that How about our young colleague? Ms. Schreiber? Ms. Schuster! Whatever. Please. Why Ms. Schuster and not you? It's fine. I got it. It's no problem. Male and female trainees begin at the bottom of the ladder. KLAUS: How's it going to look if Mrs. Lohmann or I open the door to a student? We're locked in! Come on, Peter. It's for you, Mr. Engelhardt. Ah! I don't talk to students at this hour. It's not a student. It's a father. Worse still. What does he want? Tell him I left. He can hear you! So now he knows. I'll take care of it. All right, Yes, I want to speak to him. Uh, Mr. Engelhardt? Great, come in. PETER: Really? PETER: Yes! May I ask your name? I'm Fabian Prohaska's father. Prohaska. Look, it's Mr. Prohaska, Mr. Engelhardt! Fabian's father! My consultation hour is Wednesday at 10. But it's urgent! Everything is always urgent, urgent, urgent. Climate change is urgent, or the refugee question. Why do people take their petty concerns so seriously? That's quite fair. I don't think HOLGER: People with concerns need a friendly ear. And if it's urgent, we need to be here. How can we help, Mr. Prohaska? Has something happened, does Fabian have a problem? Is Fabian's problem. Mr. Engelhardt So I'd like to talk to you, Mr. Engelhardt. Very briefly. In private. Please. What's your son's name? Fabian Prohaska. I'm his father. Yes, I know your son. He's a very nice boy. Your colleague doesn't think so. Nonsense. I have neither sympathies, nor antipathies. The only thing that counts for me is a student's performance. Well... what's the case in point? Had a conversation Mr. Engelhardt with my son yesterday in which... I explained to your son that, according to my records, he's looking at a D. Ah. Precisely. Admissible to the baccalaureate. One more point and he'd be of one single point. It's a matter Which he could have earned. Knows begging is useless. Everyone who knows me I'm just trying to convince you not to spoil his future. Listen, Mr. Prohaska. We have our big conference on Monday. We'll discuss all of our students. I'm sure Fabian will be given a fair chance. But Mr. Engelhardt would have to change his opinion. Which is why I'm here. I don't have an opinion, and they're impartial. I have results, I told your son as much. In giving students hope I don't believe where there is none. It's immoral. Has to take the baccalaureate. Not everyone But Fabian needs to. Your son has had over a decade to prepare for it, is at least 5 years too many. Which in his case under-performers in the system. I don't believe in keeping I'd have winnowed him out long ago. Winnowed out? His first apprenticeship by now. Yes, he could've quit Is that how you talk about my son? It's like a cancer diagnosis. It's hard to face at first, but recognition and acceptance come with time. Sometimes it's the genes, or the character. One has to live with it. Uh... Would you let me by? No. Kindly step away from the door. Uh... I need to leave. You're staying. You're staying. Sorry? You're all staying! I'm afraid I have to get back to my department. There's an experimental setup simmering away. You're staying, too! It could explode. I don't even know your son. So? Mr. Engelhardt doesn't, either! What do you hope to achieve? Won't change my mind. This approach The day is still young. We'll see. As three minutes ago. Not quite as young Enough. Step aside. You'd like that, huh? Step aside! Step aside. No! Sorry. You hit me. Flowing to your brain. It'll get blood HEIDI: Is this how you deal with concerned parents? No, but if it stops them from hamming things up, I'm fine with it. Argumentum baculinum. It's known as Sit down. Sit. Sit down. Sit. Sit. Move! All of you! Mr. Prohaska, please calm down. Why the gun? This is foolish. Please put it away. Nobody move. Or... I'll have to shoot. Don't worry, Mrs. Lohmann. It's not a real gun. I've seen them before. It's an airsoft gun. What? Like the good old BB guns, only better designed. Are you crazy? That coffee maker was a gift from our twin school in Toulouse! Couldn't you have shot Mr. Mertens instead? What do you think you're doing? Taking hostages? If need be, yes. As I already mentioned, Mr. Prohaska, HOLGER: we have our big conference on Monday. To get ahead of ourselves. So there's no need You're having your conference here. Right now. Thanks for this. My Fabian will get his point. At the end of it, He deserves it! Or else you'll shoot us? That won't get your son the baccalaureate. I think we can just give him that point. Right, Mr. Engelhardt? Fabian gets a point and the rest of us can go home in peace. I'd be happy to oblige. Over my dead body. If we submit to your threats, then from Monday on with firearms here every day. We'll have parents We cannot and shall not allow that to happen. Of space your son represents You won't turn the waste into a good investment by employing violence. You're talking about my son like that? My God! Do you know how many times I've had this pointless discussion? Parents project God-knows-what onto their genetic vegetables while the rest of us pay the price. What a way to speak about your students! You're cynical! No. Oh, no. It's honesty. Of congenital non-academics We funnel millions into university education, only to clog up the job market with college-educated non-starters. It's the truth. I think you're going too far, Mrs. Lohmann. We're not here to decide whether Fabian is suited for college, but rather if we should give him one more year to mature. He's repeated a year twice. Nonsense! So this is his last chance. Hm! Is that you don't spoil All I'm asking of taking the baccalaureate. His last chance Fine, we'll do that. Fabian will receive the extra point. No further discussion, you pocket the pistol, we can all... go home happy. Hmm? What? No. That's not what I want. Then what? To judge him fairly. I want you... You're not giving him due consideration. He's gifted. Yes. I'm convinced. Really! If you ask me, I also think SARA: there are exceptions to the rule. No one asked you. I have to get back to my department. My experiment will explode... Otherwise, want to call the police. Come off it! You just The idea never crossed my mind. I promise. And will be right back. I'll turn off the gas Enough! You're having your conference here and now. And how did you imagine that? You all talk about my son. It's simple. You discuss his achievements, behavior and prospects, before coming to a joint verdict based on your discussion. Yeah? Rather than petty-minded notes in your ridiculous book. Is the basis of fair assessment, This ridiculous book nor your pistol can... and neither you This is mob rule. No. It's self-defense. Because I've had it. I have four children. What four children means? Do you know Two times twelve, and two times thirteen years of schooling. Not to mention repeated years. That makes a total of 50 years of school that my wife and I have gone through with the children. Quite the balance sheet! Our own school years. Not counting They were presumably negligible. Fifty years of school! And a sense of inadequacy. Nothing but worries I'm sick of sitting opposite people like you and advocating for my children just so they get a chance. How humiliating it is Have you any idea to spend decades of one's life begging for one point here or a D-minus there? From fifth grade on, they'll never make high school kids are told with this or that attitude! It's terrorist tactics! But did you never consider alternative forms of school? There are many... I know. They're all wonderful options, at private schools! The rich take their kids out of state schools in private ones, and place them but I'm not rich! The municipal administration. I'm with Condolences. Said to me yesterday? Know what my son "I won't make it, Papa. I'm a huge disappointment." So I'm asking you, Mr. Engelhardt: feel like a failure Should a boy of 19 because he's missing one fucking point? I'm not talking about 20 points, but one single point, which here is the measure of human worth. To your question. I won't respond I want my son to be happy! And so you're rushing headlong into misfortune? That makes no sense, Mr. Prohaska. Please... be reasonable. It's still not too late. True, but I still need to get home or my wife will be the one to shoot me. You... will now hold your conference. We like to hold our conferences at the conference table, in the conference room not in the staff room. All right, then push three or four tables together your conference table. and you'll have Move it! Put them together! What's with you two? Don't you want to help? By no means. Nor do I. What about you? You'll oversee our conversation whose opinion you don't like? And shoot anyone I don't want to influence you. I'll leave the room. Cellphones, though... If I might have your We don't have cellphones. Hand them over! Of course not. He's right. We don't have telephones here. They're with the principal in the device box. In the what? The device box. We hand them in in the morning You can check. And pick them up before we leave. There's one device box for the students and another for us teachers. With the student government. We created the project I co-initiated the pilot plan for a cell-free school... And what a brilliant idea it was. So none of you has a phone? No. Honestly. I believe him. Where does that door lead? The principal's waiting room. Uh-huh. Fantastic. Very good. Fantastic. We'll proceed like this. The clock on the wall reads 2:50. I'll return at 4:00 for your decision. You're off your rocker. That's locked. Don't shout out the window, I alone will hear you. And... no tricks, all right? I'll occasionally look in to verify that you're holding your conference. Right. 4:00. Forgive me, I almost forgot. Your names, please. What do you want our names for? You know who you're dealing with, so it's only fair. You're Mr. Engelhardt. You? Peter Mertens. Uh, that's Mrs. Lohmann. No need to ask. You're legendary. For my children, too. That's Mr. Arndt. And your name, if I may ask? Vogel. Bernd. Schuster. Schuster. Thank you all. 4:00. What now? We'll discuss his son. You can't be serious. Why not? The sooner we're done, the sooner we're out of here. Such a bad idea. It's not It'll also advance us as a group. Excuse me? "Advance us." What is this jargon? The communication structure I mean, at this school may be viewed as fossilized. Fossilized? How so? It's possible to innovate how performance evaluation is achieved. We had a seminar at college... a college seminar. Yes, precisely: I don't need a seminar. Spare me, I've been here over 30 years with performance evaluation. And never had trouble Please, don't imagine anything. I simply imagine... Knowledge is what counts. Know it. Not perceived truth or intuition. Education doesn't consist of half-knowledge it's about knowledge. or approximation, Understand? We're here to prepare young people, not to entertain them or to raise them, have failed to do so. should their parents You've got a lot to learn. Knowledge anymore. They don't want They want to be blown away. Teachers as clowns. But what has education become when I cater my classes to immature, disrespectful children, spoiled, and their violent parents to boot? It's out of the question. Exactly. I didn't imagine so. Stop with the imagining, damn it! Why am I even discussing this? How old are you? How old do I need to be to count as a worthy interlocutor? There's anything to discuss If you think about the young man's grade, you're mistaken. There's no need. It's open to discussion. Well, I think Why one point too few? Ah. That's what my notebook says. Yeah. Sure, some basis, right? but it must have One could review his performance and perhaps find there an oral contribution or homework, that might yield for example, Are you insane? the missing point. You think I distribute grades any which way? Of course not, but... But what? That I can cook the books? I know you and many colleagues do so: make contracts with students, come to arrangements, and all the rest of it. Manufacture consensus That's not what we're here for, Mr. Arndt. And I fulfill it. We have a remit What's your remit? It's not open to question. KLAUS: I didn't mean to question it. I just wanted to understand why you're here. You meant to question it just like everyone else. These eighth-graders A few days ago, in which I asked them questions. Wanted to debate the order So what? There's nothing to discuss. "Strict but fair" is my motto. It's simply done. That's how it is in Latin. Really want to know, My remit, if you is dictated by the syllabus, and those who can't clear the hurdle find another game to play. Must, nolens volens, love's labor lost. Klaus, this is The two of us are a dying breed in a mediocre school system. Excuse me, Mrs. Lohmann, but that's condescending, not to say insulting. I don't care. It looks that way from below. You're arrogant. I think she's envious. Mercy me! Why on earth would I be? Because you belong to that dying breed of teachers. That bothers you at work The only thing is the presence of students. And pay you back. They sense it Nobody likes you. At all. But Ms. Schuster here, or Holger, or even Our Chemical Lover is appreciated by weirdos. Why "even?" how supremely indifferent I am If only you knew to whether the students or you or Mr. Vogels like me, honestly! My name is Vogel, Mrs. Lohmann, and I find... to be portrayed as a witch It can hardly please you in every school magazine. I receive mail from former students every year and get invited to weddings and christenings. No wonder. You're probably the father as often as not. Touché! What's that mean? Nothing. Ignore these frustrated, elitist power mongers. They know no better because no young person has ever thrown them... a BBQ! The idea of forcing down dead mammalian biomass And industrial-quality ketchup makes me retch. To the tune of vile hip-hip No doubt it's served or whatever it's called. or hop-hop Who can still sing "The Girl From Afar" or "Spring Song?" It's Franz Schubert. You, I fear. Real education for God's sake! The canon, ♪ The air is blue The valley green ♪ And the primroses bloom ♪ ♪ The May bells ♪ And meadow land so colorful ♪ ♪ Takes on more color By the morn ♪ That's our cultural identity! Children should take their lead from that, not from an emaciated blonde which of her little whores deciding on TV but for fashionable rags! Walks the streets bare You go too far, far too far! No, let her finish. I think it speaks volumes about our Mrs. Lohmann. Your amateur psychology. Spare me Feel free to leave. Very funny. Stare out the window. Practice tying your shoelaces. Do anything that won't overly exert your cognitive capacity. Why am I even talking to a gym teacher? And he calls himself an academic. You and that loser Prohaska are cut from precisely the same ragged cloth. Maybe, but at least we're human. Ah. Here we go again: sentiment triumphing over reason, and the touchy-feely over the intellect. Get anywhere here. Klaus, we won't This is irrelevant. No. Let's get back to the issue. The Chemistry Department will explode in less than an hour for what it's worth. The grade, we must hurry, If we want to discuss otherwise, lengthy and expensive renovations will ensue. There will be no discussion. Fine. So what do we do? What you will do. I have no idea a Cox's Orange Pippin here Luckily I have and a penknife and a napkin. Anyone care for a piece? No? Fine. Keeps the doctor away. "" An apple a day We should really use the time. Ms. Schuster is right: This situation is an opportunity, Peter. Please. We can get in touch with one another and talk. And discuss our way of communication. As well as Fabian. I think he has a right to a fair hearing. At the certificate conference. He'll get that on Monday Come on, Mr. Engelhardt. We're all fallible. Of the students' business. Maybe, but that's none One mustn't let one's weakness become a target, to a loss of authority. as it leads We've had flagrant cases of that. Can we change the subject? What cases? It relates to him. Why should we? Please. And his personal foibles, Thanks to Mr. Vogel we have this abstruse ban on cellphones. We can leave it at that. Right? It's a scandal that not even I, as vice principal, can use my cell phone. It's unheard of, and if I had my druthers... Klaus! Changes would be made! Klaus! What!? I've got one. Got what? A cell phone. I've got one. During morning recess. I confiscated it You've had a cell phone all this time and never mentioned it? I forgot. Give me it. It must be locked, right? May I? Here. It's... four digits. We can guess. If you mean to crack it that way, how many attempts will you need? I teach Biology and English, not Math. Ten to the fourth combinations. There are precisely in layman's terms, 10,000. Or, to put it Going from 0000 to 9999. If you manage 20 combinations a minute, it'll take you more than... though probability dictates eight hours, the last combination, it won't be so count on 4 hours. Maybe it's something simple. Have fun. Is a frequently used PIN. I read that 1234 No, I'm afraid not. Or 0000? This won't work. Nope. It'll go dead after three failed attempts. Or the Chemistry Department will explode. Any pertinent ideas? KLAUS: Let's derive the PIN using a biographical rather than hermeneutic approach. Translation for the gym teacher: the student's birthday. We could try Whose device is it? Benjamin Mehltau. An unconscionable 12th grader and lout to boot. We all know him well. My friend Benny. He was involved in the cell ban, by the way. Right, Mr. Vogel? Wait. Can I try something? Um... What's the plan? I'll hold you responsible if you damage it. Oh! Bam! Hey nonny nonny! Here. Translation for you: How did you do that? Well... Mehltau is a swine. He's been drawing his dick all over since 5th grade. An older teacher's skirt. And he looked up So the combination was worth a try. So what was the code, Sherlock Holmes? 6453. Come up with that? How did you a numerical combination: It's not actually Each digit corresponds to a letter. So what does 6453 spell? M.I.L.F. Milf! Milf? Does "milf" mean? And what You don't want to know. It's not applicable to you. But it worked. Just as Emergency Call would have done. You don't need a PIN. Say so at once? Why didn't you on the epic fun? And miss out absolutely unbearable. You are We should call The relevant police department... before that man returns. Fine. Should I call them? I have seniority. It's incumbent upon me to make the call. The device. Hand me Police Precinct IV, Florian Beinacker, what can I do for you? This is Vice Principal Engelhardt from Rudi-Dutschke High. Do you wish to report? What situation A hostage-taking. Please describe the situation. We're locked in here. It's as follows: Please state the location if you know it. Of course I know it. Then speak up. Don't take that tone with me, young man. What age are you, anyway? Excuse me? Ahem. Excuse my colleague. He's a bit confused. I beg your pardon! Put it on speaker. And what does this concern? Who's speaking My name is Peter Mertens. At Rudi-Dutschke High. I'm a senior teacher I'm in the staff room I see: a volatile situation. With five other teachers. We've been taken hostage. You said it. Is in the next room The hostage-taker demanding we confer on his son's grades. Were perilous for me as well. Those conferences Yeah... please liberate us? C-could you Not from the schoolyard, might see and shoot you. the hostage-taker Of course. Have you understood? The situation is serious, deadly serious. And you were? Vice Principal Engelhardt. Or you'll be in big trouble! Follow our instructions I'll be expelled or what? Give me your name, rank and badge number this instant! I'm the Director of Willy Wonka's Factory, asshole. Outrageous! Your authoritarian tone! Always with Let me try. HEIDI: Right here. No, redial. Police Precinct IV, Florian Beinacker, what can I do for you? From Rudi-Dutschke High. This is Heidi Lohmann just spoke to you. My colleague Oh, yeah, I remember! The situation is as described, please come here at once. Please come quickly, I have an experiment running in the chemistry room that could explode at any moment. The Fire Department. Then we'll bring of Engineers, too. and the Corps The situation is serious. We'll see what we can do. Are you available for queries at the indicated number? Of course. Then remain calm and we'll look into it. Maybe we'll bring along drinks. You guys sound like fun. Did he just call us "you guys"? Should I call back? The officer didn't sound interested in resolving our problem. All calls are recorded. No. They'll come. Imagine something happens the police ignored our call. And it turns out And the police never have those. It'd be a scandal. I find your permanently ironic undertone insulting. For your sandals. The same goes against my sandals? What do you have They're fantastic and conducive to good health. Right! Leave Mr. Vogels in peace and worry about your own inanities. The name is Vogel. As you wish. Something in hand We should have before Mr. Prohaska returns. Maybe he's right enough effort all these years. And we haven't given Fabian to hold this discussion. It could do us credit Without foregone conclusion. Had you been paying attention, conclusion was intended: you'd know a foregone The man threatened to shoot us if we don't vote as he wishes. We could at least try it. Vote? To what end? And it definitely won't be that. He wants a unanimous decision where we stand. But we'll know of awarding Fabian one point? So, who's in favor Do we have to vote publicly? I'd prefer a secret ballot. The complicated way. Fine, we'll do it A slip of paper. Everyone gets If you want to give the kid a point, put a dot on it. Then draw a line. If you don't, Then fold them up, and I'll collect them. This is ludicrous. Maybe, but we've got nothing better to do. Everyone done? Then I'll go around. An election officer, We need to appoint and two deputies. secretary, Your slip, please. Very funny. Many thanks. There. Thanks. Holger, you're taking notes? Mm-hm. Line. Two lines. Another line. Reason prevails. Line. Mm-hm. Dot. Dot. Yes, sir. Another dot. That makes three votes for Fabian and three against. This woman shouldn't be able to vote. This woman is a faculty member, Mrs. Lohmann. She's a trainee, for God's sake. What does she know about such things? We'd have reached a majority. If she hadn't voted, How do you know how I voted? Firstly, I don't need a crystal ball for that. Secondly, I don't care how someone votes who wiggles her ass to tantalize the seniors. Thirdly, the vote is null and void anyway. It has to be unanimous. What was that about wiggling? Leave me be. No, that's enough. Towards Sara is pissing me off. Your condescending manner She's a trainee, Apologize. He's a gym teacher. I rest my case. What's wrong with being a gym teacher? Where should I begin? It was a rhetorical question. Gym isn't a school subject, but a leisure activity. One could spend one's time more meaningfully. How? Making garlands with Nazi maidens and singing your Schubert? He's not my Schubert. A little cultural education And yes, your locker-room-scented life. Would've improved You might've become a real teacher. This is getting us nowhere. This isn't about our antipathies, but about Fabian. We really will be guilty if he fails without our having discussed him. Goodness! It's obvious why Engelhardt and Lohmann voted against Fabian, but why did you... Mr. Vogel? It was a secret ballot. How would you know? Correct. So no one would know As you wished, against Fabian's future. you voted I don't have to justify myself to you. But you could at least explain your decision, couldn't you? I don't know. If Mr. Engelhardt sees things the way he does, who am I to question him? Might be mistaken. Mr. Engelhardt Actually... I've never known Mr. Engelhardt to be wrong. So you always share Mr. Engelhardt's opinion? Why should Mr. Vogels answer that question? His name is Vogel, and he should answer the question. If you only ever go along with Mr. Engelhardt, you have no opinion of your own. Of course I do. Namely? Whatever it is, I'm not voting against Mr. Engelhardt. Because Mr. Engelhardt protects you? What are you insinuating? That porn scandal You know would've cost you your job without him. Nothing to do with it. That has What has nothing to do with what? Stop. It's irrelevant. I wasn't found guilty. Ahem. Our Chemical Lover circulated pornographic material... That's not true. in his classroom. He didn't circulate anything. Strictly speaking, It was like this: a projector to his laptop Mr. Vogel attached about some chemical reaction. To show a film It was about redox reactions converting chemical BERND: into electrical energy, which is fascinating. But not as fascinating as what then ensued. PETER: He set the class assignment and left the room briefly. HOLGER: A student, our Benny Mehltau, had the glorious idea of checking Mr. Vogel's browser history. Everyone in the class was able to see Mr. Vogel's most recent tabs: several short clips... That had nothing to do SARA: with fuel cells, I guess. The little shits recorded it all on their phones PETER: and shared it on Insta. My favorite title was: School Girls Fisting. School girls fasting? So what? This was nothing involving Lent. Dear colleague, No? An embarrassing affair. It was doubtless students should never Like I said, witness teachers' weaknesses. Stay reserved. I never showed it to anyone. Be that as it may, since then, abstruse cell ban: we've had this No one is allowed to take photos or film on school property, a smartphone, phones are banned. And because everyone owns Whether that's permissible... It's in the school ordinance. That's not everything: disciplinary proceedings. Mr. Engelhardt blocked I considered disciplinary proceedings ineffective and advised against them. They'd only fan the flames. In lockstep with Mr. Engelhardt. That's why Mr. Vogel is But we're not voting for or against Mr. Engelhardt, but rather for or against Fabian Prohaska, if I may remind you, Mr. Vogel. This has nothing to do with Mr. Engelhardt. It has to do with Mr. Mertens. Maybe you're only against Fabian Mr. Vogel, against Mr. Mertens? so you can be Ah. You and your Mr. Mertens! You dislike him, correct? It's irrelevant who likes whom. People are all the same to me. Hm. So it's true what they say: that you're an outsider among the staff. I'm an individualist. That explains the sandals. Leave me in peace. Ooh! Oh. It's agitated. Maybe chocolate will calm it down. Let me be. I just want to be left in peace. I've never bothered you. Always picks on me. Everyone Mr. Vogel! HOLGER: "everyone" and "always?" What do you mean by What's upsetting you? Would you like to share? I see the looks you give me, how you talk about me behind my back: I wear funny shoes, I have no family, I always reek of sulfur or whatever... I know I don't have the assertive voice or the charm of Mr. Arndt. Of Mr. Engelhardt "Our Chemical Lover." I'm always just No one listens to me. Everyone interrupts me At conferences, like I'm not even there. No one responds to what I say for my expert opinion. and I'm never asked all just laugh at me. The students in the law of mass action, No one is interested yet everyone must know Schubert's songs. Nobody loves Bronstedt's acid-base theory, but I do. I love it. It's... Exciting. But if I admitted that, I'd suffer Peter Mertens' ridicule. Among colleagues. It's banter We aren't colleagues. Mrs. Lohmann has been getting my name wrong for years. Periodic table's beautiful logic I console myself with the and the two students in each grade out of polysaccharides. who get a kick And if I do happen to make a splash, no one wants to know. What splash? Twice, I've managed to get my students of Young Scientist of the Year. Into the final round Twice! In 2019. And in 2016. And you know why no one noticed? You never mentioned it? Mm, no, that's not the reason. Then tell us. Why don't we know about it? Forget it. No, please tell us. I put it on the bulletin board. With the certificate and everything. It was my success story. Before going to my department. I hung it up at 7:40 By morning recess, my notice was in the trashcan under the bulletin board. Someone had simply removed it. Who would do such a thing? HEIDI: Nonsense! Did you take it down? Is it true? He was with his lab rats. How would he know? That's what Mr. Mertens calls advanced chemistry students: "lab rats." how I know who tore down And I can tell you my laudatory certificate, as it had been replaced by an invitation volleyball tournament: to a beach "Starting at 7:00, grilling and chilling with DJ Pete Mertens." I needed the pins. Sometimes you're such an asshole, Peter. Would apologizing improve things? I'd ever vote along with you. You needn't imagine Never! Okay, Mr. Vogel. HOLGER: I understand that. But if you could decide it all by yourself, if no one else had a vote, what would your opinion on the Prohaska case be? It wouldn't interest anyone. It does. It interests us. Don't include me. His opinion interests me not a bit. Tell us what you think. Mr. Vogel, I think we're... taking ourselves too seriously. Won't make any difference at all This one point in Latin to Fabian Prohaska's life, regardless of whether we grant it or not. He'll scarcely remember it in 10 years. Just as it should be. He should remember other things: the smell of bread, the sound of a ripe apple falling from the tree, a won game of beach volleyball, even. If we award him this one point, he'll go one way. One point, he'll go another. And if we refuse him that So what the hell? He's young as far as I remember. and not stupid important to any of us? And is that one point Not to me. Nor to Mr. Engelhardt. He's awarded thousands of points in his life. If he gives one away, then Lord knows, he'll have done something good, for a change. One point fewer because of it? Will someone else get No. In which I've been making a deal You see, I teach a subject with the students for years: the essential elements, They retain the composition of air, maybe, the oxyhydrogen test, and, with a little luck, the basics of the Bohr model of the atom. In return, they let me and the three or four preserve our dignity. interested students For my honest opinion, I'd say: So if you're asking me We shouldn't act like gods with grading superpowers. In the way of the kids. And we shouldn't stand Which is why I'm in favor of giving Fabian Prohaska the point go his way in peace. and letting him Please, let's vote on it again. By a show of hands. Publicly, of giving Fabian a point. All those in favor Peter? What's this? Why have you changed your vote? For the hell of it. It makes no damn difference who votes how. It still stands three to three. Mr. Mertens, welcome to the land of reason. What's up, Beinacker? Hey, Boss, it's about those hostage-calls this morning. Another one came in. Today because of that crap. So? We went out five times To five different schools. Five false alerts. But this call was different. How so? The other times, there was only one male voice, though he pitched it differently. This time, there were at least three voices. One was a woman. Take the word of an experienced colleague: It's students. Then his friends want a go. One of them calls, They'll laugh their heads off if we go out again. So we're not gonna, got it? Something else. But there was Get to the point. The calls this morning, and the call just now, weren't from the same cell. Give me the number. A fucking Saturday to me ♪ ♪ Every weekday's RINGTONE: I'll speak to the officer. Where is it, who has it? Give me the phone or else... Are you the boss? Nothing. No answer. Can we go back to work and take care of important stuff, Mr. Beinacker? Yes, sir! You lied to me. No cellphones? What did you expect? Of course. The police. Did you call anyone? Half an hour ago. The officers will be here any moment. You called the police? Indeed. And spoke to Police Precinct IV. Indeed. That's fine. But not for you. Fine for us, How can you be so sure? They won't come. They won't come. Believe me. Carry on and no more tricks. You have 20 minutes left. Fabulous. So, what now? We still haven't discussed Fabian at all. But without the students, we wouldn't even be here. Precisely: Where would we be without Fabian Prohaska? We'd all have been home long ago. You of all people should save us sociological lectures. the kitschy I preferred you on mute. When I was on your side. And like I said, I'm sick of everyone picking on me. Let's discuss Mertens. That could get interesting. Huh? But for no one else. Maybe for you, I'd be curious. What's there to know about Mr. Mertens? You'd prefer us not discussing Nothing. Why Ms. Trainee is here today? On a Friday after school's out. I'm warning you. Tell us. I'll tell you nothing. Why were you still here? Then Ms. Schuster: I missed the bus. It looked like rain, so I came here to avoid spending 30 minutes at the bus stop. There you have it. To discussing Prohaska. Let's go back You hadn't gone home, either. BERND: your lamentable part-time job Before going to at your wife's cheese shop, you had to take care of something urgent. This is your last warning. I'm afraid of you? You think I know exactly what's going on. With matured Gouda at home Why make do when you can enjoy fresh cheese here? Peter! It's not worth it. Want your ass kicked? What isn't worth what? It's irrelevant now. Let him go. Would someone please explain what the devil's going on? Ms. Schreiber? The name is Schuster. So why were you still here? With Mr. Mertens? For a rendezvous If that's what you call it. To having a relationship So you're admitting with a married colleague? That's none of your business. You've signaled virtue All this time, the do-gooder... and played While the contrary is true. Put a sock in it! Not to mention you! To the students every day, Playing super teacher while only having one thing on your mind. Volleyball and barbecues? Don't make me laugh! You are an incompetent fool. And an adulterer to boot! A disgrace to us all drawing your victims Not to mention young colleagues. from defenseless What makes you think I'm defenseless? Because. Women are a priori victims to you? Woman might take what she wants? Have you ever considered a So you're a floozy. No, I'm a modern woman. Ever heard of casual sex, Mrs. Lohmann? What's that supposed to mean? And will get you into trouble. Mr. Mertens seduced you Yes. Me in trouble? I only do what I please. On the contrary, With whom is a matter of some indifference. What? But... I thought we were something special. Come off it, Peter. On grubby equipment room mats You think fooling around between dirt and high bar of a beautiful relationship? Was the beginning I risked my marriage for you. And my career. That's on you. I sure didn't. I just like doing married men. Personally addressed, Not that I feel but what's so good about it? It's simple: They treat you nicer than their wives. They make more of an effort in bed. They get lost quick to get back to their families. They don't bug you on the weekend. On stupid little holidays. They don't want to go And they always have bad consciences. It's fun. It's all relish and no regret. Repulsive. I wanted to share everything with you. All my free periods. You two apparently share one brain. Sara! Don't make a scene. This is truly a pitiful performance, Mr. Mertens. Behold the disappointment. He's not used to dealing with real women. Enough with the innuendo. It was always the other way around for the big stud. Women were your toys, inasmuch as schoolgirls can be called women. Affairs with schoolgirls? Is that true? You had Of course not. Of course he did. That's why you changed schools. It's all slander. Dr. Clausen told me as much. Then tell us the truth, Peter. You all know how it is. Fine. Just admitted it herself. Ms. Schuster grab whatever they want. These young things if it's a married man They don't care - they're dealing with. - Cry me a river. You mean to cast yourself as the victim of what might be minors? No, they were all 18. You're so nauseating. A most apt epithet. Great. That's all I need. Thank you. Boss, I know you said to forget about it, but I couldn't. I checked the cell number. The phone belongs to a kid It turns out called Benjamin Mehltau. Does he go to school? And where Rudi-Dutschke High. Beinacker! It's Friday afternoon. Let alone this "Male-Towel" kid. No one's still at school, If we want to get him, straight to his house. we should go Mm-hm. And go to "Mail-Turd's" house. Get some officers Really go to town on his ass. Go to town. To shit his pants! I want the kid Hello. Heh. Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. I'll fetch my husband. One second. Harald? Can I help you? As to remove your helmet, Maybe you'll be so kind Is your son Benjamin home? Right. I'll have to ask my wife. I don't know. One second, please. You'd like to see Benjamin. Yes. Is he in? No. Where could we find your son? I can't quite say. He and his friends meet at that skate park beneath the bridge. Tell him dinner's at 7:00. If you do see Benjamin, Thanks! So now? Time's up. Explain to me why Mr. Engelhardt was wrong in his evaluation. Mr. Engelhardt will enter the point in his little notebook. Anything to add, Mr. Engelhardt? No. Fine. Anyone else? Mm-hm. You had over an hour. And I imagine petty-minded bureaucratic crap. You wasted it on made good use of the last hour. I, on the other hand, By doing what? I thought about you all. And about what possessed you to punish my son for still being a child in so many ways. Nobody is accusing your son of that, but now you mention it, as the "coming-of-age" test. The baccalaureate is known It's supposed to indicate a certain maturity. What my notes indicate That's not in the case of Prohaska filius. He doesn't have what it takes to do a baccalaureate. You have what it takes to be a teacher? Indeed. I've had nigh 40 years' experience. Latin was still alive when he began. So you could teach us what integrity is, you being a splendid example to the children? From saying as much, but... Modesty prevents me yes, absolutely. Interesting. What are those files? What's that? Your personnel records. Where did you get them? What the hell? In the principal's filing cabinet. MANFRED: Now read them to each other. No one's reading my file. On examining your files, one starts to wonder what gives you the right to judge my son. Or, as Mr. Engelhardt might have it: Ex iniuria ius thing-a-majig. You what? Ex iniuria ius non oritur. Right doesn't arise from injustice. My opinion remains unchanged: You're insane. I was by no means only referring to you, Mr. Engelhardt. Are also morally dubious. Your colleagues Sorry, Mr. Prohaska, but we've already learned plenty about ourselves today. That an extra point for my son Yet not enough to conclude would be the most minor mistake of your lives. I don't doubt it, but sadly there was no unanimity. It's three to three. Wrong! I've changed my mind. Fine, then it's four against two. In Fabian's favor. I said it had to be unanimous. Screw that. So if you won't read them to each other, I'll reveal who you're all dealing with respectively. But we know that. Not in your case. Mr. Arndt. You act like everyman's friend, but in reality, you send your colleagues to the slaughter. What? Come on. I'm not listening to this. Arndt, sit. Would you like to hear Mr. Engelhardt, Mr. Arndt made of you? the evaluation Not in the least. "Engelhardt is a cold-hearted, petty bourgeois students and colleagues alike. Whose pedantry torments His megalomania alone outstrips his vanity." put it better myself. I couldn't have You don't come off any better. "Peter Mertens is infantile, and character-wise professionally ineligible for promotion. He distinguishes himself at parties by being overly sociable to female colleagues. An embarrassing millstone P.M. could be termed around the school's neck." Wow. On to Mr. Vogel. MANFRED: "Vogel is an opportunist and a square. He has a stench, Furthermore, and appears unkempt and neglected, the baccalaureate ceremony." even at he got your name right. Hm. At least "Heidi Lohmann MANFRED: thoroughly frustrated governess. Is the prototype of the nor an understanding of youth. She has neither charm, She'll be grudgingly kept until retirement, and then forgotten." Heidi. Would you care to comment? MANFRED: Why did you do it? It's hard to explain. Sorry. I apologize. Why, Holger? Everyone expected Mr. Engelhardt to be appointed principal. Then, to everyone's surprise, Mr. Eckhoff was brought in from outside. He made me an offer. What kind of offer? He said he didn't know the staff, and asked me to put something together for him. After Engelhardt's pensioning He said plus the... corresponding... I'd get the deputy post his parking space. Fuck. Here come the cops. Maybe we should dispose of the doobie, guys. That shit is over the top. I guess so. Mr. Arndt's dossiers. Most revealing, MANFRED: But the other personal files aren't bad, either. Mr. Mertens... Hm? We've already discussed me. Sorry to disappoint, They all know. You're said to have had up to four student lovers at a time. You're scum. Who's been saying that all along? I don't have anything on you. Ms. Schuster, You're a clean slate. She likes doing married men. I'm quite new here. I'm a trainee. Then you'll learn a lot today. Do you have the impression You could say that again. Pursue the education your colleagues of the children? and well-being You want an honest answer? This school has zero interest No, in the students attending it. My dear young colleague. That's nonsense, It's not. Remember last week's big conference? We discussed if the school day should begin at 9:00. Has long since established Chronobiology improves performance. that a later start aren't awake at 8:00. Young people simply Their first class is a waste. Scientifically proven. This has been Proven? How so? And always will begin at 8. School always has, That's stood the test of time. One could simply try it. Other schools have been trying it for a while. Only not this one. Why not? Ah. There were two arguments against it. Number one: his wife's cheese store on time. Mr. Mertens here has to be at if school ends later. He won't make it Family reasons apply to about thirty other staff members. All schedules and bus times Number two: would have to be adjusted. That would mean work. Precisely as they did So things went over the last hour in this room: Everyone against everyone else and each for his own. If you want the truth: No one here is interested in your son. Mm-hm. And you still want to be a teacher? Believe it or not, yes. To do things differently. That's so naive, it hurts. Outrageous! Is that your students What's outrageous can only reach you by fax. The test of time, too. That's stood This school's never heard of digitization. Though home schooling is now so topical, no one here is interested. Is in the secretary's office. The only router one email address. The school has They shut themselves off, can't be reached, There are also budget concerns. And nay-say innovation. You're just praying you retire Come off it. Before this broken system collapses around you. That's a harsh allegation. What if Ms. Schuster's right, and you're all just sitting it out at the expense of our children? Come off it! You act like we're to blame for every E or F. You go face a fifth-grade class full of screaming kids. Prepare lessons for 16-year-olds who tell you to your face what they can google. they won't learn who threaten to sue Talk to parents if their spawn repeats a year. Or worse! What do you expect? You get three months' vacation yearly. In which I attend training courses, among other things. Things aren't that simple, Mr. Prohaska. That every single one of us I can assure you has good intentions. Maybe you once did. But nothing remains of them. You'll go the way of steam engines after the discovery of electricity, being washed away by digitization. It'll be no loss whatsoever. And by the looks of it, How dare you, you vile wench? Wiggle your butt, You come here, seduce a married man and imagine you're a pedagogical authority. It's absurd. No, it's just time. The school has to change as must its teachers. If the school is to be reformed by people like you, God help us all. What do you like least about Ms. Schuster? Or unapologetic opinion? Her butt tell me how to do my job. I won't let some floozy Ms. Schuster in the face, too? Or else you'll punch Once. It happened once. It's all in here. You will not detail that in front of everyone. Injustice for all. Was Paula Sonsbeck. The girl's name An insufferable girl, a downright harlot. And what did she do? She made my blood boil. That morning, she and her friends were going upstairs. I had homework and my bag, a heavy load. And the dizzy-lizzies were cackling away. I squeezed by them, and she tripped me. Seriously? At least, she almost did. HEIDI: not to loiter there. I told the girls They should go to or prepare for their next class, instead of striking poses like scarlet women. Pretty young women SARA: prostitutes for you. are automatically Yes. No. It's how they talk and dress, and lack of decency! their directness everything is displayed. Nothing is a secret, The dirt, greed and... Love of life? For Shakespeare's sonnets, One can feel love a string quartet or even a little couplet. But what young people today rejoice in is nothing but base instinct. Is all about screwing. Shakespeare Even gym teachers know that. To cut a long story short, MANFRED: and the girls didn't back off. Mrs. Lohmann started a fight The girl offended me deeply. Well, you called her a prostitute. There were many witnesses. Repeatedly. A teacher can't start something. You started it. Paula Sonsbeck's insult was in retaliation. What did she say? I will not repeat it. "Unfuckable shrew." Here it says: You hit Paula Sonsbeck so hard, she lost a tooth. That'll teach her. Her parents reported you. There was disciplinary action. Your pay was cut. Your promotion suspended. You had to apologize to the student. If you say so. Right? You despise youth. All that because Maybe you're just envious of the girls? If you say so, Stasi-Arndt. Listen: I don't hate the young. I just can't stand them. Hm. To make you so hard-hearted? What on earth happened Your softness, understanding and tenderness: They're not worth it. You only get disappointed. You're better off without that romance nonsense. Then you don't get hurt. So you were hurt? None of your business. Like I said: That's true. SARA: But maybe others, or at least we, would treat you differently if we knew you have a heart that beats for someone or something. Georges Moustaki. Hm? Sorry? Georges Moustaki, the greatest chansonnier of all times with the most beautiful lyrics, for Edith Piaf, too. I admired him as a young woman. From high school in 1976, After I graduated I even followed his tour through half of Spain and all of Portugal. ♪ No ♪ ♪ I am never alone ♪ ♪ With ♪ ♪ My solitude ♪ Once I was very close to him. In Lisbon. And again. I loved him. I had to see him again I still do. I waited behind the venue. Monsieur Moustaki! YOUNG HEIDI: in my homemade jeans skirt... And I stood there and sassy jacket. Evening. I'm a great admirer of your art. Thanks very much. Very pretty. Pleasant evening. Ooh-la-la. Then there was this little slut, her tits almost tumbling out. That hurt you. I understand But that happens to many girls who fall in love with a pop star. It passes. Yeah... Superficial crushes may pass, and everyone is interchangeable. When there's no foundation with Moustaki within me. But I had a future I lived for the man. I lived with him. I had children with him, a family. You're crackers, Mrs. Lohmann. Well, Mr. Mehltau, let's get to it: Why the hell did you do it? Don't you know it's punishable? It was a herbal cigarette. No biggie. Show me your phone. I don't have it on me. Are you shitting me? I don't have my cell on me. No. By whom? It was confiscated. Who's Mrs. Lohmann? Mrs. Lohmann. A teacher? At my school? Rudi-Dutschke High? During morning recess. She took it from me You made no calls from it this afternoon? How? Mrs. Lohmann has my cell. What the hell are you doing? What does it look like? I'm having a smoke. The smoking gym teacher. How fitting. Athletes are people who smoke and drink And still perform without a kink Sit back down. Shoot me if you must, but I need a cigarette. Where's my damn lighter? Smoking is prohibited throughout the building. Our Chemical Lover is back. Call me Our Chemical Lover again. Mr. Prohaska, tell Our Chemical Lover not to wet himself. If you start a fire here, I'll extinguish it. I'm warning you. Oh, yeah, Chemical Lover? Really? Pity, I was hopeful. Same here. Can we finish up? MANFRED: There's only one left. Mr. Infallible. Propriety personified. Go on, play your trump, so your little mind can find some peace. Let me summarize. Class 10a wants to take a trip to Rome of the Latin language. to the roots Homeroom Teacher Engelhardt creates a varied schedule, and finds a hotel and a bus company. And divides them by 28 students. He then calculates the costs This makes for a contribution of 410 euros per participant, including travel, hotel, and admission fees for museums and educational institutions. So? But that's not the real price. In fact, the bus operator had bribed Mr. Engelhardt to get the contract. The hotel price was wrong, too. A discount for years, It had given him pass along to his students. Which Engelhardt didn't And he also hid the fact that he charged his students for individual tickets, but ordered group ones. Every student 410 euros in cash So he collects from each and though the actual price per person Mr. Engelhardt? was how much, Hm? 295 euros. Ah. So each student is paying you 115 euros too much. With a class of 28, that makes... Well? Say it, it's all in there. It is. 3220 euros. Not bad, old lad. And who knows how often you did it? I did it once. Her gall bladder operation. My wife had a year abroad in London. My son was doing The car was broken. Do you know what it costs to feed a family? Yes, I do. I still don't steal. It all blew up in your face noticed the group-ticket trick. Because two smart-asses They confronted you, and you threatened to discipline them with bad grades. Klaus. Is this really true? First you steal from children and their parents, to wiggle out of the affair? Then you use such means Klaus! I paid it all back and never became principal because of it. What more do you want? For years, you've acted the role model and worn a halo of infallibility after committing such a lapse? Klaus, I don't understand. How can you hit a girl for being joyful, carefree, and pretty? Let me recap: A brawler, a snitch, a pornographer, an adulterer, and a con man are to decide if my son is or is not entitled to one single additional point. You think that's fair? It seems a justice gap has emerged. I'm appealing to you again, Mr. Engelhardt. Under the circumstances, and because none of us are flawless, how about that point? Kiss my ass. Mr. Prohaska said it himself. Klaus! Ex iniuria ius non oritur. Right does not arise from injustice. He meant that because of our wrongdoing, to pass judgment on his son. We have no right But it's a double-edged sword: Our having been taken hostage is wrong, and no putative right may arise from it. Then one injustice must outweigh the other. Our failings have nothing to do with our grading. Our having been taken hostage, is a direct result of it. however, So it's the greater wrong. Stop twisting things, you asshole! My son is getting that point now. When the school explodes... Or the moment has come... I'm begging you, let me go make sure things are fine. One way or the other. We're nearly done, Mr. Engelhardt, please reconsider: still find that point? Where might we more intriguingly still: Or, wait, How did the point disappear? Hm? What do you mean? Maybe he had 5 points and one was deducted. Has very scrupulous methods Our colleague surely to deprive students of points: Poor handwriting here, stained homework there, things like that. Open your little notebook Mr. Engelhardt, and tell us what it says. Hm? It's none of your damn business. And check for myself. I swear I'll take it You wouldn't understand my system, anyway. Of tallying up points and marks It's a sophisticated method that takes into account all the parameters conceivably relevant in assigning grades. Namely? Topic-relevant quality, style of presentation, that is, neatness. Correctness I rate as a priority, at about 71 percent. weighing it Then comes style and handwriting, of an oral performance, or the eloquence if it's not written work, in further deductions, that can result additional points. or, rarely, Now I want to know concretely, what... get for his assignment? What did Fabian What is entered there? Grades. And which is the grade? Fine. I'll give in to the pressure. A D grade, as you knew. Here you go. I bet that's noted there. Were there deductions? You do. I don't have to tell you. Or I'll break your fingers to get that. One point. "One point" what? Had to be deducted. Because of tardiness. Why? Meaning what? Handed his work in late. The student How much too late? Explain what that means. I'd agreed with the class It's simple: that the big assignment had to be with me by Tuesday at 1:00. Everyone was punctual except Mr. Prohaska, with his assignment. who was late By how much? Two. "Two" what? Days? Weeks? What? Minutes. He handed it in Two minutes. While babbling something about a jammed printer. Among young people. A ruse typical Everyone was on time except Fabian, a one-point deduction. so he got How was my son's assignment? Fair in terms of content. A tendency towards six, Five points. But not enough to give them. And a one-point deduction for tardiness. You shitbag. PETER: hypocritical old shitbag. You repulsive, Two miserable minutes! Two minutes? He's not baccalaureate material because of two minutes? It's a question of justice! The rest were on time. Small-minded malice and power, No, it's a question of you miserable old bastard. Klaus! Give me the notebook. Who loves chemicals now? Klaus! Now... we vote. Okay, come on. Oh, man. Fine. Now we vote. Of awarding one point? All those in favor Klaus, I'm sorry. With you anymore. I can't go along You can't pocket money from a class trip, while sealing a student's fate because of a two-minute delay. That won't do. It won't do! Raise your hand now. Go on, Engelhardt, raise it. Raise your hand! Please, Mr. Engelhardt, please. So this all finds an end. I will not raise my hand. Never. Give him the point, Engelhardt. Klaus, do it! Do it. Just do it, Engelhardt. Police! Drop the gun! Drop it! Down on the ground! On the ground! Get down! That's right, nice and easy. EMT: Just around here. Take a step up. And be seated. Go buy some. Got a spare smoke? Snitch. Dick. Listen, officer, I need to get into my chemistry room. You're staying here. We need a statement. I've told you all I know. With something else. You'll come up Beinacker! How are things? It's all fine. Good work. No injuries. Nothing beats experience and intuition. I didn't mean you. Thanks, Boss. Can I use my phone? I'm afraid not. I just wanted to call my wife. May I, please? I can't remove the cuffs, but I can unlock your phone and put it on speaker. Thanks. It's here, in my pocket. The code is: 1, 2, 3, 4. You have voicemail. Want me to play it for you? I won't listen. Worried that I missed dinner. It'll be my wife, My son will be waiting, too. I fought for him. Hey, Dad. It's Fabi. VOICEMAIL: Listen, the thing is... where you are right now, I don't know but by the time you get home, well, I'll be gone. I'd wanted to tell you yesterday, but... after our conversation. I didn't dare You were so upset. I've thought about the baccalaureate, studying and all that. Maybe Engelhardt is right. You know, university material. Maybe I'm not And maybe I shouldn't take the baccalaureate, but do something else. Maybe that one point is like a sign on the wrong track. that I've been I know it's a bit late, but... to me yesterday, and he said Engelhardt came and talked as an opportunity I should take it to change my perspective. I guess he's right. He's pretty okay, really. So what I wanted to say, is you don't have to be pissed with him about that one damn point. Really. It doesn't matter. Anyway, I think I just need to get away for a bit. I got from Grandma for my 18th. I took the money It's enough for a ticket to... you know, to go surfing. Okay. I gotta go. In a couple of months, that is. But I'll be back soon. Then I'll start something else. You'll see. So don't worry now, okay? Okay. Don't worry. I'll be in touch. Bye, Dad. Yours, Fabi.
