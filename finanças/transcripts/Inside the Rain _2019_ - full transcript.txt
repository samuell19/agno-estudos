Hello, Ben. I'm Dr. Holloway. OK. On a scale from 1 to 100, 100 being the best, 1 is the worst, what do you think your level of functioning is? 1. I'm gonna write down 20. It's 1. If you were 1, you'd be a zombie right now. I am. On a scale from 1 to 7, 1 means you're so depressed that you need hospitalization and 7 means full-blown mania. What is your current mood? I'd say it's a 2 but also somehow a 5, I think. You have what is called a mixed state. You're experiencing depression and mania simultaneously. OK, cool, I guess. Did you go to medical school to learn how to say that? So what happened at school? First class at noon. Dad, I need to find dry cleaning because I have three fucking luggage bags of shit that need to go into my dresser, into my closet, and everything is wrinkled as fuck. And I need to find out where the nearest dry cleaner is. Maybe they have an iron. I don't iron. I don't know how to do that. I get stuff dry cleaned because it's the 21st century. - There she is. - Hello! Nancy Glass. Oh, it's wonderful to meet you. This is Ben. Hi, Ben. Hey, nice to meet you. How are you? And I'm David. Thank you so much again for everything. Oh, you're so welcome. That's what the Student Disabilities Office is here for. Wonderful. Thank you. So this is the new home for Ben. Yes. Thanks for helping me unpack. This place looks fun. I want to go to school here. We love you. OK, I know. Whatever. All right, dude. Lot of pretty girls, right? Yeah. Um, I gotta get ready for class. OK. I'm Brian. I haven't declared my major yet. It's between business school and fine arts. I guess I'm bipolar in terms of my interests. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ben Glass, and I'm a film major, and I'm a new transfer student. And unlike Brian, I'm actually literally bipolar. But I prefer to call it recklessly extravagant. Thank you. Our first assignment is going to be a short film based on real experiences. Hey, what, uh, what are those exactly? Adderall. Oh, nice. Yeah, I take this for ADHD. Yeah, I've heard of those. Those help you keep, like, focused and still, right? Yeah, you know, I drink a vodka with Coke and pour a 5-hour Energy shot into it. And, uh, I down all of that with the Adderall. Oh, that-- that doesn't kill you? No. Of course not. I'm gonna ride. She gonna ride. We gonna ride. I'ma what? I'm gonna ride. She gonna ride. We gonna ride. I'ma what? I'm gonna ride. She gonna ride. I'ma what? I'm gonna ride. She gonna ride. All right, all right, you matching me. You matching me. You're matching me. I see you. I see you. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. All you. All you right now. Hey. I'm Ben. This is my friend Griffiin. Hey. What-- what are y'all's names? Or, I mean to say, what are your names? I'm Beth. I'm Tiffany. Well, it's nice to meet both of you. I, uh-- it's funny. I never know how to address two people at once. They say y'all in Texas where I just transferred from. Hey, do you wanna go to the bathroom? Mm-hmm. Dude, that was so awkward. Hey, it's my mom. Gimme a second. So, uh, my first week was cool. Is that music in the background? Yeah, I'm in a stoplight party in, uh, senior housing. What's a stoplight party? Uh, green means you're single. Yellow means it's complicated. And red means you're in a relationship. What color are you wearing? Mom, what do you think? Well, um, there's a sale at Macy's. I could send you all the red clothing you want. That's so lame I might vomit. I love you. Bye. Hey. You're in my film class. You're, uh, Daisy, right? I'm, um, Ben. You live a recklessly extravagant life, so I hear. Very extravagant. Extravagantly like Odysseus. Like Odysseus. You're going to have to explain that to me. Should I get undressed? Duh. So what makes you like Odysseus? Well, I read it in high school, and I think Odysseus is the first man to live recklessly extravagant. I mean, when he goes to sleep, he sleeps for like 10 days straight. And when he fucks, he fucks the hottest sex goddesses in the world. And when he gets angry, he slaughters 100 people. It's-- it's like he's on a manic high. And when you sleep with your fellow classmates, what happens? I have to get up early. Why? It's a Saturday. Debate team meeting tomorrow. We have a match. I'll debate you. Do you know anything about debating? Our critique of military presence, it discourses the abilities and crucial contributions to colonizing international alacrity, which triggers a longitude that only destabilizes its network. But their command sites examine these places where the apparatus of military power torches the ground. I don't understand anything you just said. It's like another language. I really like it. Well, uh, we should do this all the time, right? I have to get up so early. Can I sleep here? Ben, maybe you think this is more than it is. We're not dating. You should go. Really? Yeah. Yeah. OK. I guess I'll leave now. Well, it's morning. Have you ever been in love? Have you ever been wronged? I want your film to show the truth. So does anyone have any idea what they want their film to be about? Ben, we haven't heard from you yet today. I don't, uh, feel well. So sorry. I'm gonna go. I've been sitting here in tears. Oh, those seven lonely mornings, they seem like seven lonely years. The world's just been laughing at me now 'cause your love I just couldn't see. Now you're gone. It's too late now. Those lonely Mondays at my door. Oh, those seven lonely Mondays. Hi, Ben. I'm Dr. Bradley, dean of students. Hi. Ben, as you well know, we're a very close-knit community here at Penrith College. And we never want anyone to feel at risk. Can you tell me why you overdosed on your medications? That's personal. Well, not if it involves the other students around you. I'm really sorry that it happened. I'm sure you are. But do you think that college is the best thing for you right now? Yes. And you don't want to take a break? No, I wanna stay. All right. Come in. I heard you were back. I wanted to see how you were doing. I'm fine. I, uh-- you don't have to worry about me. Well, I was a little concerned. You know, this happens a lot, honestly. And besides, they gave me a lollipop at the hospital, so. You shouldn't make jokes about that. I'm totally cool. Are you sure you're OK? I'm more than OK. This is the greatest day of my life. I have to go. Police. Police. Are you Benjamin Glass? We got a call somebody wants to hurt themselves in here. - Are you Benjamin Glass? - Are you Benjamin Glass? I am. Let's take a ride to the hospital. Let's go. Where are my parents? Why would you do something like this? Huh? I didn't do shit. Then why am I here? I do not wanna be stuck in here, OK? I do not wanna-- I can't be treated like this. Shut up. When I got back on campus a few days later, all of a sudden, Daisy walks in, and she says she's concerned about me. And then she sees all the meds on my desk, and she thinks I'm trying to hurt myself again, which I wasn't. I was taking my meds as prescribed by the shitty doctor before you. So the cops rush in and grab me like I'm some kind of criminal. It was a total misunderstanding, and now the dean of students says that's two strikes and I have to leave Penrith College. It's ridiculous. So I asked for an appeal hearing to prove my innocence. And how do you plan on doing that? Well, I-- I can't speak well. I'm not a lawyer. My dad won't let me get a lawyer for some stupid reason. So I'm going to make a movie to show everyone what really happened. You mean like a documentary. No, no, a movie movie with, like, a script and actors. I think you need to stay away from Penrith for a while. I'm not here for your advice. Can you just prescribe the meds? All right. All right. But I got to tell you. I can cure you within six weeks. How do you know you're gonna cure me in six weeks? Because I've been treating people like you since before you were born, you little shit. Have some gratitude. I don't have any gratitude. Fuck you. You know what? I'm going to redact my clinical observation of 20 on your chart and replace it with a negative 50 because you're obviously functioning as less than a two-year-old. Now we agree. OK. You know how much I love paintball. And you're my only loyal friends. I've known you guys since elementary school. And I need to ask you guys a huge favor. Is this is like the time you asked me to do your laundry? That wasn't laundry. That was dry cleaning. This is different. I need you guys to crew in the movie I'm gonna make. What movie? All right, you know the rules already. They're pretty straightforward. Once you get hit, you put your hands up, you walk off. We'll see the paint on you, so don't try to hide it. Well, as you know, I'm suspended, pending an appeal hearing I requested. And I have no witnesses, so I'm going to make a movie that proves my innocence. You can't make a fictional film and use it in court. Yeah, Shawn's right. That makes no sense. It's not a court. It's a school hearing in front of the J board and the dean of students. I already have a script in my head. Can I count on you guys? - All right. Look, I'm in. I can help. Are you guys in? - I'm in. Yeah, count me in. When's the last time you got laid? When the dinosaurs were here? All right, you're getting manic. So what? All right, you're on your way up, and I need you to bring it down, like, 100 notches. OK. Why don't you sit up? Sit up, please. I don't want to sit up. Ben, sit up now. Thank you. Yes, your honor. I'm sitting up now. I'm going to raise your lithium dose to 1,500 milligrams. I heard you told you it makes me fat. How long have you been sleeping at night? Uh, two hours a night, which is perfect for me. OK. I'm going to also prescribe you 400 milligrams of Tegretol at night. It's a mood stabilizer. Oh my god, I don't need more fucking mood stabilizers, Dr. Holloway. And 3 milligrams of Klonopin to help with sleep. And I don't need sleep. What I need is a lawyer who can fuck Penrith College in the ass. So are you going to try to meet any girls while you're here in the city? Fuck no. Are you kidding me? Look, I really think that you need to be more social. I'm too much of a loser. Let's face it. Girls don't like me. All I do is lay in bed and order in. And feel sorry for yourself. Which I should. I should feel sorry for myself because I'm a victim of a horrible discrimination. But, uh, I'm going to a strip club tonight. What-- no. No, no. No. Strip clubs are not the best place to meet girls. Well, I can't meet a girl in real life. I've been to strip clubs. I've been to many strip clubs. $20 per song. If you want five songs, that would be $100. If you want to go to the private room, that would be $700 for 30 minutes. If you wanted to go to the super, super room, whatever the hell that is, it's like $1,000 for 30 minutes. What if you just want to jerk off? Well, then you would be saving, I guess, $1,000. Ooh. Can we talk to the girl? I know that they said we couldn't, but holy shit. Dude, you're such a lightweight, bro. Come on. I'm just getting warmed up, bro. Where do we put the wasabi, man? Let's find out. Don't ask. Do you think they got dragon roll? Oh, man. So is this a business meeting? Do you guys work on Wall Street? Honey, we've made 20 million since we got here. Wow. That's impressive. Mm. And we like the sushi girl. She's, uh, really focused. I'm impressed. I'm glad. I'll be back shortly. Keep them coming. Keep them coming. Hey, kanpai. - Kanpai. - Kanpai. I'm gonna give you a heart attack, baby but I'm cool as the ground. I've been walking since the break of dawn. Never going to come back on knocking at your door. I've been walking through the night and day. Ain't never going to come back. I might just turn around and wave at ya. Hey, you know when it comes down to it, I ain't joking when I know that you've been through it. I am, I am whoever I say I am. I like your outfit, baby. Hey. You're very handsome. Do you work in finance? No. I'm in college. So you want to unwind after studying so hard? I think that's a great idea, baby. Yeah, sort of. Don't be so nervous. Is it your first time at a titty bar? Relax, baby. You're so cute. Do you want a dance? Do you want another drink? Uh, no thanks. I'm all right. How about one for your lovely companion? I'll have a Long Island iced tea. How much is that? 26. Do you work in finance, baby? I'm on the corner of 12th Avenue and 50th Street. Where are you exactly? I gave you the address already. It's the strip club, the Veil Nightclub. No. Look, cancel my trip. No, no, you have to-- Do you have a light? Uh, no, sorry. Do any of you have a light? For you? Anytime. She's the naked girl from inside with the sushi on her body. This is her. Dude, you missed it. She's a fucking treat. That's me. You're a pro. I'm a model. But that was my first time performing nyotaimori. Fuck. So tonight, you lost your sushi slut virginity. What's up? What's up? No? Hey, what's your name? No name. No name. Uh, OK. I'm going to call you naked sushi bitch. That's great. Let's go. Hey, naked sushi bitch, do you give head a la carte? Because I'm going to have one order of the happy ending blowjob. - Hey, wait. Get the fuck away from her. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck is your problem, man? Hey. Fuck off! You've got anger issues, dickhead. I'm glad. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. You're a fucking psycho. I can't believe those guys talked to you like that. I get that sort of thing all the time. It's gross. Yeah. Well, see ya. Hey, I'll walk with you. What do you want? I don't know. So what do you do when you're not starting fights in public? I'm a filmmaker. You make movies? Yeah, I'm in film school, and I'm making a movie. Here. I make movies, too. Hey, Emma Taylor. I'm Ben. What kind of movies do you make? Well, you have to make a donation to find out. I have to go. Have a good night. Hey, Griffin. What's up? Ben, uh, hey. What's up? Hey, I haven't been able to reach you. Did you get any of my messages? Yeah, yeah, I did. I just-- I've just been really busy with school. Are you coming back? Hell yeah, mother fucker. I just have to win my appeal at the school hearing. You're going to be a character witness, right? Uh, I mean, what would I have to do? You just attest to my character, say whether I'm a good guy or a bad guy. Yeah. Um, you know, I'm kind of late for my next class. I got to go. - It's going be easy breezy. - Yeah. Yeah, keep me up to date, OK? Professor Peele, I'm going to do your assignment about a personal experience, and I'm going to use it to defend myself at the hearing. Oh. Well, I don't know if that's a good idea. I think it's a great idea. I think I'm going to do that, and can you be a character witness? I don't know about that. This must be really hard on you. Yeah, I've been feeling horrible. I'm going to be your advocate at the hearing. That's-- that's really great to hear. Just hang in there. Where were you yesterday? I was at, uh, Penrith gathering witnesses. I don't think you should appeal. I think you should just transfer. Good morning. I know what I'm doing. I'm making a movie to prove my innocence. What movie? It's going to be exactly like what happened that weekend. And it's going to be the truth. That's a terrible idea. I don't want you to make a movie. Are you hearing this? He wants to make a movie about the trouble he got into and use it as a defense at his hearing. Your father is right. Maybe you should drop your appeal. It's a delusional psycho plan to make a movie about this. They're going to think you're crazy. It's not going to teach anyone anything. I'm late for work. We'll talk about this later. Yeah, I got to go, too. But I'm going to reach out to the dean of students today and see if we can work something out. Until then, don't do anything. The whole thing was inside out. So you see if I got in there, I can make a difference, but I didn't know. I didn't know what to do about it. Hey, Dad. - It was awful. One moment. Yeah, my production company collapsed. I had a few DUIs here and there, which did not help. I'm sorry. Dad. Actually-- Ben. Dad. Ben, please. Look, I don't need money, Dave. I wouldn't ask for that. But the thing is, between me and you, I'm living in my mom's garage. That's awful. I know. Dad, can I say something? Actually, we're in the middle of something. Dad, I want the hearing to happen because I need to prove my innocence. And I'm making movies because that's my best fucking defense. Ben, please. I'm making the movie. No, actually, you're not making the movie. So get over it. - I'm making the movie. I'm making the movie. I'm making the movie. Stop. No. - Then I'm stop-- No. Then I'm stopping all my meds until you get me a lawyer. You just stop taking your meds. What kind of a movie are you making? He's not making a movie. Monty, you know what? Let's talk later. Actually, guys, I need you to get out of my office right now. Please. OK, come on. Thank you. Dad is frustrating sometimes. So my wife kicked me out of the house in LA. I got my shot in New York, so I figured, what the hell? I'll come back here and give it a shot. So what's going to happen to you? Well, I don't know. Something will turn up. What is it? Where is that music coming from? Ben, you can't play music at this hour. You should be asleep. Mom, I don't need sleep. I have special powers. The music was helping me to relax, and you messed it up. But you're playing loud music at 3 o'clock in the morning! So? Are you taking your meds? No. You're acting like a lunatic. And you need to take your meds. I already said I'm not taking my meds until you get me a lawyer. OK. OK. Turn off the music. OK. Thank you for meeting us. Ben threw out his medications, and he's refusing to take his medications until we get him a lawyer, which is obviously is not happening. He also says he has special powers. I do have special powers. Ben, you have to trust me to take your medications. But I feel much better off of them. I don't need to sleep. I can outrun a car, and I control the weather. Do you hear yourself? You're manic. So what if I'm manic? Well, you're going to have a huge crash into depression. That's not true. I feel great. Ben, I've treated thousands of patients who were manic. The longer you go without your meds, the worse the crash will be. I'm not going to crash. That's ridiculous. Ben. Ben! Pay attention. Ben! Mom, I can hear everything. What do we do if he won't take his meds? He has to be hospitalized. I'm not going to a psych ward. OK. Well, if Ben won't take his medications and he won't go to the hospital, then I need him to sign this form here. You hear that, buddy? You really should take your meds. He has to sign this if he wants to see me. I've recommended hospitalization. He's not listening to my medical advice. So this is to make sure that I am not held accountable just in case Ben hurts himself or others. Look, this is all melodramatic for some stupid reason. But I have to meet someone, so I have to go now. No, no. Ben. What you have to do is listen to Dr. Holloway, Ben. Ben! Can you do something? Do you want to follow him? Do you want to get him? Did we come here for no reason? Do I-- I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm sorry. So is this unusual behavior for Ben or par for the course? Hey. Hi. Guess what I just did? Did you beat somebody up? No. I just walked out on my psychiatrist. She thinks I'm manic because I said I have special abilities, which I do. What are your special abilities? I don't need sleep. I can run faster than a car. And I control the weather. Really? Yeah, I'm going to make you a star in my short film. Tell me about it. Well, OK. I was wrongfully kicked out of school, and I'm making a movie to prove my innocence. Interesting. Yeah, and I'm doing dramatic reenactments of all the shit that led up to my suspension. And I've got a very important role for you. Is there a script? Yeah, it's all in my head. I just have to finish typing it up. Well, I'll have to read it first. Ugh, it's my parents. They won't stop freaking out because I said I'm going off my stupid meds. Well, why do you take them? I'm the man, that's why. Well, why are you the man? I'm bipolar, ADHD, OCD, borderline personality disorder. What else? You name it, I've got it. Maybe you should take your meds. Oh, I got to go. Where? Work. I'll send you the script soon. See if I have time to read it. I'm taking my meds again. Really? What made you change your mind? This girl thought it would be a good idea. What-- this girl? Who's this girl? She's, um, Emma. I met her outside a strip club. These guys were harassing her, and I told them to fuck off. Ben, you can't start fights in the streets. You got to be very careful. I had to. I saw a damsel in distress. So what do you know about this Emma? She's a glamor model. She's an escort. She does porn. Oh, Ben. OK. Please tell me you don't plan on seeing her again. Yeah, I want to cast her in the movie that my dad doesn't want me to make. Oh. So, you like the porn actress. Yeah, I really like her. She's hot, and she's cool. She might not be dateable. Oh, she's definitely dateable. Really? Yeah. Of course you know that because you're an expert on porn stars. He's asleep. Wow. I am so glad he took his meds. What made him change his mind all of a sudden? I have no idea. Hm. Let me tell you something. I know many of the best writer directors on this planet. Spike Lee, PT Anderson-- Paul Thomas to me-- Martin Scorsese-- Marty to me-- Bob Fosse. And I'll tell you something. You are as good as the best of them. Yeah, even though you're only 25 years old. So, you got any plans? Well, I need to make this movie to prove my innocence. You want to make a film. I just happen to be a film producer. Great. Let's do it. Got any money? Not yet, but I want it to look really cinematic because that's the only way to convince the J board that my version of the events is the truth and nothing but. Cinematic. Cinematic. You want that cinematic look. Absolutely. You know it's going to cost you no less than $5,500. 5,500 is nothing. So you're on board to produce? Sir, yes, sir. I will be stationing scenes right here in the garage. It'll be perfect. Haha, I can't wait to make this movie! Oh, there we go. Sometimes you got to kick this to make it open. Hold on. There we go. Perfect. So can you get the money? Is this really how it went down? It's the truth and nothing but. I'm playing myself. And you're playing Daisy. I'm not sure I want to do this. Oh, I have to go meet this guy. Which guy? He's a regular. Who is he? I don't talk about my patrons. I'll walk you to your car. OK. What are you doing? I like this song. I know I'll see you, paper moon. I feel like I have left too soon. And in this gray goodbye, we share the moment as one. I reached the end, but I don't feel like I'm done. And I'm still hiding, paper moon. And you're still climbing, paper moon. And I won't get choked up when you leave here tonight. I'll see you when I get to the other side. You're so ordinary, but you make me feel brand new. I'm so ordinary, but I can wait for you. I know I'll see you-- This is it. - Paper moon. Cool. I feel like I have left too soon. The song was a nice touch. And in our gray goodbye, we share the moment as one. Emma, you're larger than life. You're so ordinary, but you make me feel brand new. I'm so ordinary, but I can wait for you. Thanks for your help. Hey, Emma, you look stunning as always. Hi, Greg. So what are we doing today? Swimwear. OK. I think I'm ready. Who's he? That's my friend, Ben. Is it OK if he watches? As long as he's quiet. Amazing. Stay there. Stay there. Beautiful like that. Wow. Look at me. Great, beautiful. Stay there. Beautiful like that. Yes. Yeah, I think you can change. Yeah, you can change. So did you have fun? We should get married. Don't be ridiculous. I'm serious. We just met. Let's get married. No. Do you want to meet my parents? Hey, Mom. Oh my-- Hey, Dad. This is Emma. Emma, hi. I'm Dave. Hi, I'm Nancy. Hi. - Nice to meet you. Sit down. OK. Here you go, guys. We've been hanging out for a few days. Nice. Where'd you guys meet? Outside a strip club. Ah. That sounds fun. Yeah. Every Friday night, you can catch me doing body sushi at a strip club in the city. Ah, in the city. Isn't that so cool that she's a model? Yes. Emma, don't tell them about the movie. Chin-chin. Chin-chin, kids. Chin-chin. Your dad's really cool. I like him. Thanks for not talking about the movie. I'll do it. Seriously? Yeah. But is this what you really want? Oh my god. I want it really badly. Then forget about me playing Daisy. What? You have to choose. I'm not doing both. What do they have to do with each other? Every time I get intimate with a guy, everything goes wrong. And I like you, and I don't want things to go wrong, so. I want to make the movie, Ben. Now go. Can I stay? No. Go. I just get the vibe that she's really good for the part. Yeah, good for the part of having sex with you. It's not like that. I'm serious about her. There'll be other girls. But she's the first one. I've never had a girlfriend before. I've never brought a girl home to Mom and Dad. This isn't the girl. I mean, for all you know, she could be having sex with many men right now. It really doesn't matter to me. It does matter. This is what she does for a living. She makes porn movies. She sleeps with guys with cash. People rarely change, Ben. It's going to be different with us. That's highly unlikely. Well, you know, anything is possible. Yeah, you know what else is possible? A giant asteroid crashing into the Earth, but it's highly unlikely. Well, you came out of nowhere and walked into my life. Then you got me all excited, and I had to look twice. There you are. Montgomery Pennington. Emma. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure. Good to see you, Monty. Yeah, salute. This is going to be my first big acting role, and I'm really excited to be working with Ben. He's written a really great script. Penrith College is discriminating against me under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. And these fucking assholes need to pay! We're asking for $5,500 in donations, the required budget to complete the film. It's an all or nothing campaign, so if we don't reach our goal, we get nothing. We've got 14 days to reach our goal, so we're on a very tight schedule. We have some really great rewards for you. And I need to prove my innocence! Wow. I think you guys did a pretty solid job. Don't you think Ben was a little negative? No. No, it doesn't matter. Just watch our money pile up. Ben? What are you doing here? Nothing. Want to come inside my office? No. What's wrong? I'm never going to raise enough money to make this movie. Ah. Why don't you try begging for change on the subway? How about you beg for change? Hm. You'd probably make more money because you look so sad and pathetic. I'm not begging for shit. Then get off your lazy ass and come inside and talk to me, OK? This is like crowdfunding page. I need $5,000 in the next four days to make my movie. Can't you just make a little film with a smaller budget? I swear to God. Do not call my film little ever again. How about I call it manic delusion? You must be loaded up the ass with money. What is it, $250 to speak to you for five minutes? Yes. You're going to give me the rest of the money I need for my movie. Hm, let me think about that for a second. No. Well, I'm getting my money no matter what. Hey, are you Sammy? Yes, sir. Can you open your trunk? OK. Let me get that for you. I got it. I'll help. Ugh, what the hell do you have in here? Thousands of dollars in pocket change. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. So 104-- 5th-- 4th Avenue, right? Yeah, but you know what? It's actually fucking closed right now. We gotta go somewhere else. Somewhere else. What do you mean somewhere else? Do you know where we can find a coin machine to cash in the change? A coin machine at 3 o'clock in the morning? Yeah, I have to do it now, because I don't want my parents to find out that I'm borrowing all the money. Well, you-- you're not one of them crazy white boys, are you? I'm not a crazy white boy. So where's-- where's-- what's the address? Look. Just drive the fucking car to point A to point B, OK? And then we'll be good. Just give me the fucking address, all right? Well, wait, first off-- Give me the fucking address. First off, don't be rude, bro. I don't mean to be rude. If you want to be rude, you can get out of my car right now. Look, I don't mean to be rude. But you are being fucking rude, all right? Yeah, just drive the fucking car, OK? Go from point A to point B, and I'll get the fucking money. Wait, for-- Drive the fucking car, OK? You know what? Fuck this, man. What are you doing? Whoa. Whoa. Don't take the bag out. Don't take the bag out. No, no. No, no. Never disrespect me like this. No, no. - I'll take the bag out. This is shit. I'm not going to jail for this shit. I'm not fucking doing-- put it back in the car. Look what you fucking did. What, I didn't do shit, man. You're robbing me. - I'm not picking shit up. - You're robbing me. - I'm robbing you? - You're robbing me. You-- wait. Yo, get out the car. Yo, bruh, get out of my car. Fuck! Get out of my car. Yo! Get the fuck-- get out of the car. Get the fuck out of my car. Hey, Siri, call Dad. Get out of my car! Ben? Get out of my car. I'm going to call the motherfucking police. Get out of my car! - Sir, sir. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Don't sir me. Get out of-- Do not call the police. Hold on for one moment, please. No, hold on shit. He's hijacking my car. Ben, get out of the car. Is this about that stupid little movie? Is it? Answer me. Dad, I need to make this movie. You don't care about my innocence. Don't make the fucking movie. I'm not going to stop. No. I am not fucking around here, Ben. Now stop the delusional movie, or go into the psych ward. But you make a decision. Ben, you need to make a decision, and get the fuck out of my car! I want justice! I want justice! I want justice! - I want justice. I want justice! Just-- fucking --ice! I want justice! I want justice! - Hey, hey. Hey, OK. Justice! You know what's crazy? Don't say crazy in a psych unit. What's crazy is that my doctors don't even know what I have. They don't even have a clue. My ankles are swollen. My lung is twice the human size. Maybe it's cancer. I don't think it's cancer. But I want to know what it is. If it's cancer, I'm jumping in front of the G train again. Just open. 93 over 70. Open. Thank you. Oh. I brought you the notebook you asked for. Thanks, Mom. How are you feeling? I shouldn't be in here. Why don't you try to focus on something positive, sweetheart? I was talking to your dad. And he is so not mad. And he loves you so much. And we were wondering if maybe-- I don't know-- maybe, maybe, maybe you wanted to transfer to another school. Would you like that? Mom, I wouldn't like that at all. You wouldn't like that at all. Hey, buddy. Hey. What's up, my man? I got to say, they gave you a big room. This is, like, not bad. What are you guys doing here? We came here to cheer you up. There's no point anymore. I'm fucked. You're not fucked. OK? You're going to snap out of this, and, you know, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. That's what you're going with? Besides, you've got something to look forward to because we're going to take you to paintball again. There's just really no point. If I can't win my hearing, I'm going to jump off a bridge. Will you stop being so silly? You're going to be out of here in a couple days. You might even have enough time to still raise the money for your movie. You think I can raise $5,000 from a psych ward, and I don't even have internet. That sounds like a great plan. No. When you get out, maybe you can campaign some more. That's ridiculous. You guys are friggin' nuts. You're the one in the psych ward. Hey. Can I have some of that? Yeah, sure. Thanks. So, what are you in here for? You don't want to know. No, yes, I do. Criminality. I stole $5,000 in change from my parents. $5,000 in change? Yeah, my parents are hoarders. So what are you in here for? Um, I'm here because my dad is going to remarry. Who is he going to marry? One of my childhood friends. Oh, no. Yeah. He's marrying my best friend-- ex-best friend. And he put me in here so I wouldn't come to the wedding and embarrass him. I got to admit, that sounds pretty intense. Isn't it? Have you been here before? No, my first time. You? I lost track. Really? Yeah. Speaking of which, can I show you something? Yeah. Some crazy guy showed me how to do this last year. Voila. Wow. You're a genius. Finally, someone acknowledges it. You're funny, too. Which way is your room? Um, it's that way. Mine's this way. Thank you for the view. You're welcome. Good night. Night. Excuse me. Could you tell me where Benjamin Glass' room is? That last room with the light on? Yes. Thank you. It's this way. I called this meeting today because we need to keep making plans. I'm not going to let this stop me. I don't know if you know this, but the hearing's in two weeks. Right, we need locations. We don't have any money. Do you think it's realistic anymore? We only have one day left in the campaign to raise all $5,000. I'm aware of that. Can't we just improvise with a smaller budget? No. What's your plan to raise all the money by tomorrow? We don't need to do anything. Why not? The money will come to us. The fates have chosen me to get this money. I just know it. Maybe you should stay in here another few days. Emma, you're not wasting your time. You're going to be an actress in my movie, and I'm going to get an Oscar worthy performance out of you because I'm great. And modest, too. So when do you get out, bud? My parents pick me up tomorrow. I'm going to call you guys. And we'll keep making plans. But definitely, do not tell my dad because he will put me right back in here. One minute left. So now that you've returned from the psych ward, on a scale of 1 to 100, 100 being the best, 1 is the worst, what do you think your level of functioning is? 100. I'm going to write down 70 since you just got out of the hospital for stealing money. Jars of change. And hijacking a cab. You'd do that in the same situation. I would never be in that situation in the first place. Well, maybe you should be more like me. Live recklessly extravagant. And why would I do that? I have a great life, a wonderful husband. No kids? Nope. Never wanted kids. You're missing out. You work too much. Why do you have that goofy grin on your face? I just raised all the money. You did? Who gave it to you? It came from one anonymous donor. Someone you know must have put the money in there. Well, I'd love to thank whoever gave it to me. I find it very suspicious. And we start filming in five days. Emma's co-starring. OK. I need you to remember that I don't think this is a good idea. OK? You're still manic, and I'm worried that Emma is going to disappoint you. She's not. Everything's going fantastic. Doo doo doo. He's so cute. Here comes your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Yeah, right. Hey. Hey. Ben, this is Rex. Hey, Rex. - And this is Anna and Javier. - Hi. Hey, Anna. I've heard so much about you. Nice to meet you. So we're ready to rehearse? Yeah, I'm ready. OK. Bye, little guy. Jup, jup, jup, jup, jup. Bye. Bye. So adorable. Emma, you never talk to me like that. Well, you have to be adorable. I am. OK. What does you live a recklessly extravagant life mean? Why does Daisy say that? I said it in class. That's where I met Daisy. The teacher asked us to say something about ourselves, and I said I live recklessly extravagant. No one lives more recklessly extravagant than me. Bullshit. You don't believe me? No. You don't know that much about me. Keep stroking nice and slow. On the count of five, I want you to come, loser. 5, 4, 3, 2. Can you imagine doing me from behind? You better not come until I say 1, loser. What are you doing up? I can't sleep. You're not going to hurt yourself, are you? So we just met at the stoplight party at senior housing. We walked all the way to your dorm room. It's midnight. We're tipsy. Your roommate's gone. Uh-- I'm getting a little nervous. Yeah, so am I. I'm going to wire both of you guys now. OK, roll sound. Sound speed. Roll camera. Camera speed. Scene two, take one. Camera set. And action. Where's your roommate? I thought you were reckless. So I can undress? Yeah. So what makes you like Odysseus? Oh, well, I read it in high school. And I think Odysseus is the first man to live recklessly extravagant. I mean, when he goes to sleep, he sleeps for, like, 10 days straight. And when he fucks, he fucks the hottest sex goddesses in the world. And when he gets angry, he slaughters 100 people. It's like he's on a manic high. And when he sleeps with your former classmates, what happens? OK, cut. Let's do it again. To the movie. Cheers. So yeah, I'm thinking I'll do a road trip to LA and then do photo shoots along the way and maybe couchsurf or something. So when do you think you'll be done editing the movie? Well, the hearing's in 10 days, so definitely before then. And if you win your hearing, when do you go back to school? In the spring. But I really, really think that you should pursue acting. I think you're amazing. Ben, I believe you think that. But I also think you're just trying to sleep with me. So what makes you like Odysseus? Oh, well, I read it in high school. You're good with that? I like it. I want to report there's a student on campus trying to kill himself. Hello, Mr. Scumbag. Ha ha. How dare you do this to your family and everyone at Penrith. Help! Help! I like it. It's good, right? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, the sandwich was really good. It was just a sandwich. Hey, why can't we date each other? I don't get it. Ben, stop. What are you doing tomorrow? I'm going to the beach early. It's a Saturday, so I want to get there early before it gets really crowded. You want to come with? Uh, yeah, definitely. Well, I leave really early, so maybe you should just spend the night. That's cool. Do you want me to sleep on the couch? We can just share a bed. Man, I'm getting tired. Let's just go to your bed now. Here. Hey, Ben, I'm setting the alarm for 6:00 because we should be on the road by 6:30. What do you think you'll be doing right before you die? Hopefully having sex. You're not taking me seriously. No one does. They do. Ben, I just want somebody to take me seriously. Somebody. When I was 19, I tried to kill myself. I just wanted it to be painless. I didn't want to jump off a building or anything because I was afraid I'd mess it up and come out a paraplegic. And I didn't know how I could face my family after doing that, so I took a bunch of pills and ended up in the ICU with my heart being monitored. I came this close to dying. I can't count the number of times I overdose. I was going to school in Texas at the time, and my dad kept flying back and forth. And I'm amazed at how much he was able to handle going between his company in New York and me in a hospital in Texas. I haven't told anyone that before. So that's me taking you seriously. Are we still on speaking terms? Do you know what you're getting? Hot cakes, sausage, hash browns, and coffee. I'm getting the same with the bacon, egg, cheese biscuit and the sausage burritos. You can have half my sausage burritos if you want. OK. We'll each pay for half. Everything's on me today. Don't worry about it. Let's just split it, 50/50. But I'm really starving, and I want to get the bacon, egg, cheese biscuit. Well, that works because if you get the meal editions, then we both can get coffee and hash browns. That's too complicated for this early in the morning. I mean, we can get the exact same thing. If you get the meals, it's $17.26. That's $0.97 cheaper. I don't care enough to deal with it. Why not? Because I'm going to order the coffees and the hash browns separately. That's idiotic. What do you care? I just said I'll pay for all of it anyway. I mean, it's a waste. And for some of us who aren't heavily subsidized by our parents, $1 is a lot. You know, it's really wasteful discussing how to save $0.97. Now you're giving me a migraine, and I have to buy a bottle of Advil for $5. And then I'm going to have to pay my therapist $250 because you won't shut up about the combo meals. And I have to complain to her. And that's going to cost her $255. What do you think of that? You know, I think she'd have a little more respect for me since I fucking paid all $5,000 for your stupid film. What the hell are you talking about? I paid for the whole fucking thing anonymously, Ben. Well, OK. I'm glad that you bothered to tell me that before doing something so stupid. You know what? You can go fuck yourself, OK? How could I ever pay you back? I have 200 in my savings. I don't need your money or your dumb movie. Seriously, go fuck yourself. I'll go fuck myself. Have fun at your hearing. No survivors! No survivors! Up against this little girl and her pussy ass brother. Did you see that? All right, take the sides. Let's go. OK. Olivia, I'll take cover behind that tree. You're going to be our lookout. - OK. - Miley. - Yep. You're going to stay low, take left flank. Got it. I'm going to fuck this family up! Seriously, Ben, shut up. All right, Ben and I are going to take right. Then we're going to try to push in the center. I'll storm off the middle because I'm the fucking man. No, you're not. You're coming with me. I'm storming up the middle. That's a terrible plan. You're going to get taken out immediately. But Shawn, I've got this adrenaline in me. You know paintballs hurt when you get hit with them, right? I'm not getting hit. Come on, motherfucker! Come out, you pussy little bitches! Fuck! Ahh! I got you, piece of shit! Where are you taking us? I made an appointment with Dr. Holloway. Dad. Yes? Thank you for everything. This little girl was shooting me in the chest, and I had a horrible pain. I legit thought I was having a heart attack. I wish I was there. Why? So that I can shoot you over and over again to get my frustrations out with you. Ha ha. So funny. You know what is funny? What? You got so upset by Emma that you had a panic attack on the battlefield and thought you were dying. I've been trying to tell you that Emma probably isn't interested in a relationship. People change, though. I've been rooting for you to have a relationship since the beginning, OK? But Emma, you might not ever see her again. Look, you've really made a lot of progress since the first time I saw you. I mean, you were talking about controlling the weather and having special abilities. And you said you were going to cure me in six weeks. Which I did, because I'm that good. I mean, I'm, like, really, really, really good. So you got shot down by a bunch of people, Emma dumped you, and yet, you still seem like you're functioning. I'd say that you are functioning at a level of 90. Do you agree? Agreed. Knock, knock. Hey, Charlie. Hey. Wow, so you're really leaving us, huh? I am, I am. Be careful out there in LA. I will be. Hey, I'll leave the key under your doormat when I go. OK, cool. Well, we're going to miss you. Thanks, Charlie. I'll miss you, too. OK. Bye. On the morning of September 17th of this year, Mr. Glass purposefully swallowed several bottles of his medications. One week later, on September 23rd, Mr. Glass attempted suicide again on our campus. That's not true. Our responsibility is to keep our student body safe. That's why we created the two strike policy. Can I say something? I understand that you have a movie to show us as your defense. Yes, but before I show the movie, I asked Mrs. Morgan to be a character witness. Can she speak now? Certainly. Mrs. Morgan is a distinguished member of our community. Oh, thank you for having me here today. Mrs. Morgan, did Mr. Glass register at your office at the start of the school year? Yes, he did. And what is your assessment of Mr. Glass? He's a nice young man. And what is your evaluation of his mental health? He's a danger to himself and the community. Thank you, Mrs. Morgan. You may show your movie now. Where's your roommate? I thought you were reckless. Should I get undressed? Duh. So what makes you like Odysseus? Oh, well, I read it in high school, and I think Odysseus is the first man to live recklessly extravagant. I mean, when he goes to sleep, he sleeps for, like, 10 days straight. And when he fucks, he fucks the hottest sex goddesses in the world. And when he gets angry, he slaughters 100 people. It's like he's on a manic high. And when he sleeps with-- I changed my mind. You're not going to show the movie? No. I tried to make all of you understand me. But I see now that you will never accept me as I am. If you leave now, you're done here. Yes? Hey. Ben. What the hell are you doing here? I'm with someone. I just wanted to let you know that I quit the hearing, and I'm not going back to Penrith. Excellent! That's awesome. Now let's discuss it next time when you're not barging in, OK? You should stick with this doctor. She really knows her shit. Thank you, Ben. Now get the hell out of here. Emma. I'm sorry that we had a fight. Me, too. Do you want to get a drink? I can't. I'm headed for LA in the morning. That's cool, I guess. But I'll see you when I get back. That sounds great. How'd the hearing go? I kind of just said, fuck it, I'm not going back. Do you want to go on a road trip? I wish I could, but I've got to focus. OK. I don't want to leave things bad. Are we OK now? I think you're OK. Ben? Hey. - Hey. Lindsay. Hi. What are you doing here? I live around the corner. What are you doing here? I'm trying to rent an apartment, but the broker stood me up. Aw, that sucks. It's OK because I'll keep looking. So have you been back to the psych ward? No, not at all. I'm doing better. Good. Have you? No, no. I'm doing pretty good, actually. You know, I thought about you the other day when I was having popcorn at the movie theater. That made you think of me? Yeah. So what have you been up to? I just graduated college, from art school, actually. Wow, congrats. I still have one more year. What do you study? Fashion design. Whoa, that's really cool. I know you can't tell by the way I usually dress, but fashion is a hobby of mine. Hospital socks look really good on you. I know, right? Well, it's nice running into you. Yeah. I know a great coffee shop around the corner. Sure. Let's go. OK.
