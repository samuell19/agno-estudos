And what's the problematic, tell, is it a he or a her? It's... I don't know. Is it trizangle, circleous, or squarical? Frog, this is taking too long. Just a minutiny. This thing you're looking for, is it walkerella, locomotible, or creeper? Let me tell you a story. Story, yay! I love stories! Somebody stole my mom's memories. Who? Who was it? I'll help you, Tarsility. You're my friendly. Nobody does that to my friendly. Who was it? Tell me. It was like an animal, but long, colorful. And it made a sound like: schk-schk, schk-schk. Schk-schk. I know! Woohooo! I know what it is! You do? Are you sure? Absoluty-rooty! Want to go get it? Do I want to get it? That's what I'm here to do. Marvoolus. But first you have to promise me one little thingaly. What? You have to give me a... kismooch! Why do you want a kiss? I'm just tired of being a frog, frogster, froggerful. I want to be a prince. So as soon as we fix your problematic, you give me a… and we'll be evenied. You in? I'm in. So come on. Let's go get this pesky bugger. You think we're in the right place? Don't worry, Tarsilepede. We're going to get that critter you told me about. Woohoo! Yippee! Yoohoo! Yippee yippee! Hey, you gonna stay there? Hurry up! Or we'll mis-train! Why would we get on this train, Frog? Are you crazy? This here is it! The critter you told me about, see: It's long, colorful, and when it moves it goes schh-schh, schh-schh tooeeeyyy. The critter I told you about was a critter critter, Frog. This is a train! Hey! Where's yous a-goin? I don't know. But what about my... kismooches? No kisses. You didn't do your part of the deal. Our album. That's it, mom. Try to remember everything. The frog! I have to talk to him! Scuse me, scuse me. Excuse me! Frog, wait! Tarsility! I'm sorry, I was too hard on you. Posh... Nobody can stop this critter now! If you need me just say Ju-ju-bee!

I... I'm looking for an animal... He's um... Hey, doesn't any one talk around here? Good morning, missy. Do you have a ticket? Where do you want to go? Piauí, Parati, or Juqueí? Or Sapucaí? But no ride is free! You're in the way, that's what I say. Do you have a ticket today? Have one or none? With one you can have fun. If not you'd better run. Got it, little one? Little one? I'm not so little. And I'm not going on the train. I'm looking for a long, colorful animal. And who... paid for the ticket with this? The compass! So then, it'll be 12 o'clock soon. Do you know where you want to go? There's a train to Oiapoque, there's a train to Chuí. Hey! Where did he go huh? He who? The creature that gave you that compass. It wasn't a he, it was a her, who went to the Valley of No End. Valley of No End? Then that's where I need to go! Are you going on the blue train, the pink or on the purple with green polka dots? Quick quick, please, the train is about to leave. All aboard! Final call. Hey. Get out of the way. Hm… There's just one problem, sir. I don't have any money and… And without a ticket you can't ride. You don't have anything at all? Hmmmm... now that I think about it... Oh! I have a very valuable, incredibly rare, really delicious... piece of Kiwi candy! Kiwi? Yeah! I hate kiwi! But I also have a piece of strawberry, and blackberry, and raspberry. Strawberry? Blackberry? Raspberry? That's it? No. I also have a great big piece of tutti-frutti! Tutti-frutti, yippee! I love tutti-frutti, you see! But… But I hate candy. Candy? Did I say candy? Oh! What was I thinking? This isn't candy, it's a cand-dum! It looks like candy but tastes like gum. Gum! I love gum! Wow, and I really need to chew a piece. How much do you want for this gum, huh? I'll trade you for the compass. Deal. Hey, which train do I take? It's about to leave, right there! Train leaving the station! You just have to buy a ticket and… Buy? But I already paid you! Already? With the cand-dum, right? Oh yeah. I forgot. Gee whiz, my head's really in the clouds. Thank you! Hey wait. I'm getting on! Wait! Tickets! Tickets! Tickets, please! Be quiet, you're making too much noise! Look! Didn't I tell you she was alive? Hmmm... You're right. But what is it? A girl, I told you. Oh, of course. And what is a girl? Oh, don't pay my husband any attention. He's rather forgetful lately. A girl is a person, you see? Did his memory… break? His and a few other people I know too. Nobody knows what's happening. What was it you wanted, my dear? To ask you a question: who are you, huh? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Here we go again. See this? It's our wedding ring. This is the key to our house, this is your horn lotion. And this is your favorite dessert: hay pudding. Oh! I remember now! You're my wife! I love her. Does that always work? Yes. Geeeeee. So then maybe if I do the same thing with my mom's things… Your mom? Yeah. They stole her memories. And now I'm going to the Valley of No End to... The Valley of No End? Your tickets, please. Huh?! Where is it? Your ticket, ma'am. I don't have all day! I'd be careful with this girl, Conductor. She said she's going to… The Valley of No End. She might be dangerous. Ah without a ticket, you're not going anywhere. Don't let her go, Conductor! Come on! You're coming with me, little lady! Huh? Oh! Now what? Where am I? Who doesn't like samba, is a soul incomplete. Loony in the head, or sick in the feet. By the way: nice landing there. Who are you? I'm the monkey, can't you see, who sings on key and lives in a tree. And now I… Samba oh, shimmy low, shake and go, dance to and fro. Ziggly-e-woo, wiggelly-doo, bippety-boo, shimmy-limmy dimmy doo. I'll give you two good clues... Clues? But rhyming is what you must do, and sing for me it's true, That's what I want from you. But I don't know how to sing... Hello, hello, that's wrong! There's got to be rhymes in the song! OK ok, Mister monkey. I'll give rhyming a try. I don't really get it. Or understand why. Now you're getting it, you've got the beat. Shake your body and move your feet. Three vases I'll show you, and here's the deal. If you sing and dance then two will open and their clues reveal. That's alright, that's okay, it's all up to me. Let me see what I want to see, I'll take vase number three She lives in a place really high. Think carefully now don't choose in haste; which will you open, you can only choose one vase. I got it, I understand, this is kind of fun. Go ahead, you can open vase number one. When the day ends, all memories will be hers. Her? Which her? Who is this 'her'? Just two vases, like I said. That's how it goes. That's just all there's to be read Your clues you already chose. Not now, or even later can I give this little filler: That vase number two said it was the Caterpillar. Oops! Ah-ha! So you're the one! “February 21st: I went out with my friends and we gobbled up all the cotton candy in the town square.” That must have been great! “April 17th: Today I went out with him. We went to the movies and saw Fishtronaut. I don't think I've ever had so much fun”. Look what we have here! A beautiful Manacá flower. What sweet memories you must have! Oh yes, so very sweet. She went to so many dances with these earrings! How many special moments wearing them! And now they'll all be mine. As soon as it's midnight all these memories will be mine! Hello! Oh! How many times have I told you to knock first? Sorry. Just don't forget next time. But not even that can bother me today. Ohhhh... You're so great! Here. Oh wow, thanks! You sure you don't want it? No, I don't really like dolls. I'm in more of a pre-adolescent phase now. Is that serious? Clean this up. I'm going to want to play with my new toys in a little bit. Ohhh... These things all have such wonderful memories… Oh! Memories from a marriage proposal! Mmmm, so romantic. Uh! Oh, and a present from a loving dad for his daughter. Mmmmm this memory is so cuddly and soft. And now it's all going to be mine, Big Smelly. It's Billy Bellygood. Huh? My name is Billy Bellygood. Cuz I don't even smell! You really do have a bad memory. I don't need your silly jokes right now. Though I have heard worse. Ohh! Mother? Oh, how I wish you were here with me. No, don't leave the house, mom! Yeah! Hold her back, Agenor! Careful! I... Grandma's quill feather! Ah-hah! Gotcha! Oh! Time for children to be in bed. Who are you? You'll find out soon, little girl. And now? Know who I am? Oh! I know who you are! You're Cuca! The monster from that lullaby. But I'm not a baby. Let me go! Show some respect, little girl. Ahhh! Let me go! It's beddy-bye time! I'm not going to sleep! Just wait and you'll see who's in charge around here! Time to eat. And what's for dinner tonight? Bug soup! Yuck! Disgusting! And now it's time for the child to sleep and she can't. I love this. It's already late. Time to make sleepy. No. I don't want to sleep. Stay awake, Tarsilinha. Stay awake.. Now you belong to me! Sweetheart? Wake up, sweetheart. It's time to go to school. Mom! Is that you? Mom! What was it, sweetheart? It's you! Oh, I'm so happy! So so happy! Could everything really be there? Come here, honey, give me a hug. I had a horrible nightmare! It was like this, there was a big wind, you were lost... And then? What happened? Wow! Thank goodness it was just a dream! What's the matter, Tarsilinha? Don't you like the box? That's not what was in the box You're mine, girl! No! Give that back! Give me that now! But what's so special about this mirror, I'd like to know. None of your business! Give it back! No! That's the only way I could see my… Gingerbee... Gen... Joba... Ju... Joba... Ju... Ju... JUUJUUUBEEEEE! Somebody callring? Frogster! I knew you wouldn't abandon me! You said the magical wordage: Jujubee! And Frogster jujubeed! I'm so glad, so glad you saved me, Frogster! Yeah! I'm not sure! Look back there! Drive! I'm going to distract that crazy Cuca. But I don't know how to drive! Neither do I, holy moly! Come here you cucko Cuca! Boo, you big-tootherly! You big ol' silly-ilical! What? I don't think that's helping! Yous can't-a get me! Hey! Anyone ever tells yous looks like a giantical bananer? Ah-há! Now I'm getting the hang of this driving thing. Oops! Sorry, I think I hit the wrong pedal. Oh! Shoot! I'll get you! “Shoot! I'll get you!” You won't get nothingage, Cuca! Hello, children! No! Fasten your seatbelt, Frogster! Why? How do we get out of here? That way! There? But we're going to crash! Go for it! Oh! Curses! Now what? Where do we go now? With this ex-tank? Eeee. We're not going to get very far. Oh. I think we ran out of gas. Oh man. What's wrong, Tarsa-iccup? Nothing. Nothing? Only if I want to swim. I'm gonna drown in your tears soon. It's just that when I got to this crazy place I found a mirror. And I could see my mom with it. But I dropped it when I was running away, and then Cuca broke it. And I can't find any of the other keepsakes. Everything's going wrong! Come on, Tarsilicious! You're so coolity! I mean, you're doinger everythingfull to save your mom! You still owe me some kismooches, but I still like yous. Oh my, that's right. You want to turn into a prince, right? Hm... Not that I needs it. No, of course not. But you deserve it. Nanica! You kooky, Tarsilooky? Who's Nanica!? My name is Frognald! Come on! I'll explain it on the way. Surefy that's her, that's Nanica? Uh-huh. I saw her just this morning. How much for the doll, sir? Ten thousand for you, my dear. Nu-uh-uh-uh-uh she's not paying that. This dollness was her mom's. Really? In that case it's more: 50 thousand. But it was stolen! Stolen? Are you sure? Oh, well, then that's different. 100 thousand! So, want it or no? Hmmm... I guess not. No? But you can't pass a deal like this! Nanica Doll! From 100 thousand down to 99,999, tax free! And I'll even throw in… this beautiful comb. But, this offer is just good for our first caller. Want it? Thanks. The price is alright, but... But? But I'm not gonna take it. Just imagine. It's a good thing my mom got rid of it. Oh yea... Better believe it. That Nanica is so grody anyways! What does that mean? Cursed. Ever since my mom got Nanica, all sorts of bad things happened to her. Oh, poor thing! Oh, and since she's so smart and stuff... She gave Nanica to the meanest girl at her school! And what happened to that girl? Her teeth all fell out. And she got all stucked like this: cross-eyed. And deaf. Yeah, but she doesn't ever complain. What? She doesn't complain! Why? She can't talk. Get out of here, you evil doll! Well done! Now you'll only have good luck. Bye! Phew. It's a good thing I got rid of that doll! Thank goodness I found you! Lemmee see if I understand: Yous getting all these things so your mom's memoryship will come back? It worked with Rabbit's husband, it'll work with her too. Yous already got the compass, the key, the feather, and the dollity, right? What else are you missing now? The memory of all memories: the earrings. They must be with her. And where does this Caterpilleller live? In the Valley of No End. Va-va... Va-va-va... Va-va... The Valley of No End? Are you coo coo? Yeah. Why? What is this Valley of No End anyways? It's just no one from heres has ever gone theres. Even better! We'll be the very first! Hang in there, mom, we're going to make it! Oh! But how dare you, don't you knock? I was just needing to talk to somebody and you're the only somebody around here. What do you want? To tell you I threw out that jinxed doll What doll? That one I gave you? I found out it's cursed; the girl out there told me. What girl out there? Yeah, a little short girl, with licked down hair, that walks like this. How did that little pest get here? I don't like the sound of this. I do. Now the bad luck went to her. Would you be able to find her again? OK. But I'm not going anywhere near that doll. But first, fetch me my towel. Look away. I need to find out where she's going! Now? Ah! What did I just say? Ahhhh! Unbelievable! Get out of here! And make sure you knock next time! We've got to find this Valley soon, Frog. I'm getting hungry. Oh, I-me too. If we just at least knew which way to go. Look over there! A Market! Goody, and it's a great bigly market too just look at it! Let's go. Who knows maybe we'll find something out there. Hot, hot, hot! That's too hot! Hmmm! Try doing this. Hey, what are you doing? Nothing, no! Just looking at your shoes! They're beauts, by the way. You're from out there? I've got new pairs if you want: boots, galoshes, sandals, flip-flops. Flippers and slippers. You interested? Ooo! Nice! Oh good taste! It'll go well with this one. And this one. And this one too. Hey, you guys! But each one is different? It's the latest craze: loo with loo, roo with roo, every foot a different shoe Sure-ely! Yous only gots one foot! No, sir, one leg. Oh, do you by any chance have a leg? I have four paw-ticles. And they're way better than your legity! Guys! Cut it out! You're Saci Perere, aren't you? You got him. I mean: Me. Want an autograph? No, I don't want an autograph. A Caterpillide stole her mom's memories. Caterpillar! Did you say: Caterpillar? Actually he said Caterpillide. Oh, that thief! She just came by here a bit ago and swiped a shoe. And, then when I try to get her to pay, she gives me this face. Says that when she wears the shoes, she feels like a different person. Keep going, Saci, keep going. That creature likes so much not being her that the other day she said… "One day I'm going to the other side and steal a life just for me." Frog, that must be her! Tell me, one-leg, yous knows where Caterpilly lives? They told us we have to go to the Valley of No end. Who lives there? Her? No Pererecoo, my grandma. Do you know how we get to that place? Well... I know it's that way, but… Who would be crazy enough to even go there? Hey, hang on there. Where're you going, girl? Hey! What's gotten into her, huh? She doesn't have much time-ity to find that Caterpillery, Sacilliam! But that way is the Valley of No End… Come on, Oneleg! Me? Yeah... Then you could get your shoesicles back! Yeah... And she's already taken like twenty shoesicles… I mean shoes! Then let's gone going-a! So let's get going, I will give you a ride. Is it really that hard to knock? I'm sorry, it' just... Have you seen Caterpillar around? I am Caterpillar, genius! Wo..Wo... Wowwww! You look good in a wig! What do you want? Well, you told me to keep on an eye on the girl from out there, right? Well so, she's coming here with a frog and Saci. Saci? It seems he wants some shoes back. Those old shoes?! That Saci really is a bother! Hmphf! How much longer until mid-night? Um, six hours. Oh! Mon dieu! That gives the girl plenty of time to get here. Here. Take these baubles. These make bubbles? It's not bubbles, it's baubles. Set these out in her path. While you do that I'm going to call a friend. Hurry, take her the earrings! I thought they were baubles. And don't slam the door! What did you just say? Don't slam the door when you leave, heathen! Close the door calmly. Six more hours and her life will be mine. Just six more hours. Hello, is Dilla there? I have a little job for you… I think we're going the wrong way. Wrongaly?! What do you mean? The Valley of No End is a deserted place… Yeah, but this is a deserted place. No, this place is fancy. Look there, even the cactus wear earrings. I don't believe it! Wow! It's them. The most important memory! Now I can go home! Thank you, Perere! I would have never found the earrings without you! Gee, even I'm going to get embarrassed like that. Get ready, Frogster, it's time for those kismooches you asked for. Yay, yay! I'm going to be a prince! Did you hear that? I did, and I've heard it many times. That sound is an Armadillabird. They eats little frogs, big frogs, and me-sters too! I told you, I told you. Oh no... Now what? Ahhh It's coming this way! Run, you guys. Wait for me. Phew! That was a near close. Hey, Armabully! Why don't you pick on someone your own sizeness! Watch out, guys! I taste really bad! Frog! Oh, no no no no no no no! Saci! Frog! Hey, I'm over here. Saci! Saci! Are you ok? Say something, Sacilliam! Ahhh, nasty beast! Come back here and I'll show you how many legs a Saci is made of! One? Ah, I'm beat. Go ahead, Frog, go. It's ok, Saci, we already took the Armadillabird out. And now it's an armadi-lying there. So then, everything's ok? Heh, as if. If that critter there wakes, he's going to turn us into lunch. Hang on. When I came here, I came through a place like that. Like what? White, all white. Do you think you can get back home through there? So then go, Tarsislug. Hit the road, bye-bye. But...? You already got back everything that Caterpillar took, right? I did! Then go, it's getting late! But... and you guys? We're made out of colors you see: green, yellow, and blue-esy. If we go in that white we'll... pft... disappear. Your momma-mommy needs you. Yeah, go. Hurry up! Bye, Perere! Bye Frogster! Bye, Tarsilinha! Oh geepers! What? My kissmooches! Hey, Tarsifib, you forgot my kissmooches! You're right! Hang on, Frog! I can't paddle back. Bye you guys, bye! Mom! Mom! Mom! Tarsilinha! I did it, I did it Agenor! Mom! Oh momma! Do you remember me? Who are you? Hang on, you'll remember in a minute... It's all here. Everything. How lovely. Is it yours? No, no, it's yours. It's Nanica. Nanica, strange name... Yeah... What about this? You remember this, right? It's Grandpa's compass. Hang on. We still have time, right Agenor? She's going to remember! Look at this, mom. The feather... The feather that grandma used. Oh how stupid! Stupid. Of course, I should have started with the most important. You see, Agenor? It can't just be any old thing, it has to be something special. Wake up, Mom! I have a surprise for you. Here, take it. Remember mom... Your grandma gave them to your mom, who gave them to you. They're beautiful. Yes! I think you're confused, these aren't mine. What? Of course they are! Mine? Oh, the earrings, mom. Oh mom... I don't understand... I don't understand! What did I do wrong, Agenor? But of course! Of course! The Manacá flower. The most important memory! I love you, mom! I love you! Agenor care of mom. I'll be back before midnight! Bye! Jujubee! Jujubee! Help! Help! Over here! Don't worry, guys. I'm going to get you down! Wow, What happened? After yees left someone came up from backbehindsees and boom! Bunked us right on our idea! Hmmm... It must have been that caterpillar! Saci! And your mom, did she remember everything? No! But it's because I forgot the most important thing. The day he met my mom, my dad gave her a Manacá flower. Then she put that flower in between the pages of her diary. It's the most important memory, and it's the very one I forgot. You think when she sees the flower, she'll go back to how she was? Think no, I'm absatooty sure! Oops… I mean 'absolutely'! And the diary, Caterpillaga has it? She must have it... So then, what are we waiting for? Let's put some speed to our steps guys. Hurricane express coming through! All aboard! To the Valley of No End, Saci! I mean I've seen some people before, but nobody as stubborn as this girl. Huh?! But how did they get down from the cactus? I tied them up really good. Uh-huh! I can see that! But whatever… It'll be fun to see them get so close and have to go back empty-handed… oh! Quiet! We're here! This is it? This no! That! Gee whiz! The monkey was right when he said she lived somewhere really high! Oh oh oh... Looks like there's one heck of stormness brewing. Oh, how much time do we have left? Two more hours. Come on! We'd better hurry! Wow, how coo-cool! Oh! Hurry up, Frog! This is really dangerous! Just one singly one! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Take a picture of this stud here! Nu-uh! You'll break the camera. Now enough, come on. Let's go. You want to turn into a prince or not? Me? My prince-ipal wish! Phew, that was exhausting, right? Anyone have some oxygenement? I don't understand. How do we get in? A-ba-po-ru. Huh?! Who said that? It was that talking cave-er up there. A-ba-po-ru. That's it, Caterpillar lives inside that giant-al! And we're going... in there? Hmmm... That mouth opens sometimes… When he says that word! What word? Something like... Kan-ga-roo? A-ba-po-ru. Be brave, you guys! Come on! Lessgooo or it's gonna close, one-leg… A-ba-po-ru. Wow! Is everyone still in one piece? Ah, I'mma one piecity still! Oh, me too! Huh? Hmm! Look at this. So much stuff... Hmmm... Memories from the Malfatti family. Hmmmm... Memento from the Andrade family. Mementos from the Amphibious Family. Hmmm… You think I'mma end up like this? You already are like that. Butterfly butterfly, whence do you come I don't care, No I don't, just go home. Butterfly, butterfly Where do you go... Where the sun don't shine and where you don't grow. Who could have known such a simple little journal could hold so many memories? Who needs objects when there's an entire life here? And to just think, all these memories will live in my little head. I don't believe it... Hang on! Is she talking about your momma-mom? That Caterpillar's gonna get it! Hey! Shut your mouth, Caterpillar! In my day, people knew how to knock before coming in. Give me back that diary! Or you're gonna regret it! Ohhhh I'm so scared! It's not yours! It's my moms! Only until mid-night. After that, all these memories will belong to 'moi'! Mommy will have to start a new life. I'm gonna get you! I'm the one that gets things around here. Quiet! Take our guests to the room of bad memories. Oh no, to my room? What did you expect? They'd stay in mine? No, but... Hurry, go. There's plenty of room there! And take this horrible butterfly with you! Ah! But why my room? It's always me… Why my room? Quiet! Ugh! This musikee is gonna make me loony! Billy Bellygood, prepare a bath for me in the Johnson's family bathtub. Right away, boss lady. And oh! Don't forget those little lavender soaps from the Smith family. Got it! What a relief-eteef! Oh man, all this is stolen stuff. But it's all just old junk. Yeah, it's all just a bunch of nothing. Not all of it. Oops. That's ok, I'm fine, I'm fine. Huh, it stopped? Strange, it never stops! What's happening? Hey come here... get back here!! Go, go, go, go, go! I'll get you! Come on guys! Let's go go go go! Come on, come on, come on! Go, go! Come back here! Good one! Go, go, go, go Run run run, you guys! Come on, come on, come on! Hurry, run you guys! You three again? Billy Bellygood can't do anything right can he? Silly little baby! I'm not a baby! I think you're just a little too late cherie... you're nearly out of time. You jealous old Caterpillar! I'm with ya girlity! Me too Tarsilinha. Billy Bellygood, take care of these two pests while I handle this little baby here. Pests? We've got your back, Tarsilinha! Come on Oneleg. Let's finish off Billy Bellygood.. Hmmmm, what delicious memories. You really want the diary, baby? Then go and get it! No! No! No! By the time she finds the diary, her time will be up! Stay still! Stay still! Stop hopping and spinning. Come on potbelly, catch us if you can-ally! He's so slowful. He can't catch us. A-há! Got you you little squirt. Wedgie time! Where is it? Where is it? Got it! I knew I'd find you! Come on Sacilliam. Let's show this Chicken Belly how we play ball Há hahaa! Check out my kick ups, and with just one leg. Nailed it! Wow! On the beam! Ha há, you missed me. Oh yeah? What a shot! Watch out! Frog! Get off me! Why do you want all those other people's memories anyways, huh? Because I am a collector of memories. And it's none of your business! But what's the point of having memories of things you didn't do? You have your own. My own? Do you know what it's like to be a caterpillar? Do you know what it's like to lay in bed and only have two types of memories? Walking on branches and eating leaves? Hang in there buddy. Man this guy is heavy. Frog, are you ok? Everything ok, frog? Talk to me, Frog. One day I stole a silk scarf. It was amazing! And then I just couldn't stop: There was a pearl necklace, a painting. All those memories brought light into my dark life. Oh... So you want stronger memories, huh? Then take that! That hurt. And here's a memory of the Duster Family. And here's a memory from the Baccara Family. What is this? Am I in a cocoon again? I just have to be patient... wait a little… and my beautiful wings will open! No! Where are my wings? Get me out of here! I just want to forget about this! Get me out of here, I want out of here. Oh my, poor thing. Please, get me out of here. I can't stand being stuck in here! Get me out of here, please! Hang on. I'll get you out of there. Please, please. Don't put me back in this cocoon. I just wanted to get my wings and be free. But you'll never be free with other people's memories. You have to give them back! Give them back? But without them I'm just a caterpillar, nothing more. The most beautiful caterpillar ever! Look at those little dots. Billy Bellygood! Are you ok? Yeah, when I'm with you, I'm always ok. Look at these little dots. They go perfectly with your eyes. Oh! How cute. You think so? Uh-huh! Oh, that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me. Tarsilinha, we've got to get out of here, the frogster needs some fresh air. Frog, what happened? Caterpillar, you have to help us now! Or Frog is going to die! Let's give it all back. Really? Yes. I think you're right, Billy Bellygood. Come on, we have to get rid of all this stuff! I'm giving it all back! Use the wind to get out of here! Your mom doesn't have much time! Go, Tarsilinha! Come on, Saci! Bring Frog! Hurry, Tarsilinha! Oh, Frog! Oh, is he... No, no it can't be! Poor little hopper, he was a pretty cool guy. And I never even gave him that kiss he wanted. Hmmmm... Anymore kissmooches for me? Frogster? Of course there are, Frogster! I love you! Oh! Wow… Wow, Tarsilinhady, I turned into a prince! Lookee there! It's Prince Frogster! Ha há! You didn't turn into a handsome frog like me! Who needs to? I was born handsome. Boys, I'm going to miss you so much. Really truly. I know, Tarsilinha, but save your speech for another day, you're almost out of time. Yeah, it's almost midnight! Bye, Frogster! Bye, Saci! Bye, Tarsilinha! Bye, Tarsility! I love you guys! Us too, Tarsilinha! Mom! Where are you? Oh no, It's almost midnight! Mom? It's me, Mom! Who are you? One thing at a time. Look what I brought you. For me? Wow, but... No, no, there's no “but”. Open it. Go ahead, turn the page. - No, no. Come on, keep going. - Me? Yeah, yeah. Come on, you can do it. Well? Do you remember? It's the dried Manacá flower... from the day you met Dad. No, it can't be... I did everything right. Hey, why won't you come back? I'm right here! It's not fair. You have to get out of there, you have to come back to me! I don't understand. Mom... Mom... Mom? Mom? Hello, my love! I'm glad you're awake. I'm making us some guava sweets! You… are you really you? You're not Cuca? Cuca?! You think I look like Cuca now? Oh only you! Oh, careful with the pot! Mom, I love you, mom! I love you! I love you too, sweetheart. You are the most precious thing in the world to me, did you know? Oh… Mom! Tell me, who am I? What's the parrot's name? Where are we? Huh, but why? No, tell me, tell me. Just tell me everything so I can hear it, please! Oh, ok, alright. You are Tarsilinha, our parrot is Agenor. And we're at the ranch in our house and your dad will be here soon. And I'm making some delicious guava fruit sweets. Oh! We forgot the lime! Lime? Yeah, for the guava sweets! Ahh! Don't worry, mom. Stay right there stirring and I'll go get one, be right back. You're going to get a lime? There, from the lime tree? Of course, Mom. No problem. Leave it to me!
