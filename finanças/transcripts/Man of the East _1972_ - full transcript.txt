None of them can read and write. - Why have you been writing? I can not write, but I can read. - Kan you know, you can also write. - Is that right? - How? - Like a book from the book. "King Solomon ruled all over Israel." Well. How would you write it? - I do not know. How? - Print it as it says in the book. - You are right! - How would you write: "Five horses to horse is on my way here"? - If they come from here ... - What are you saying? - Davs. Is that something we're going down? - Yes. - Frank Austin. Me a pleasure. - Ar "old ıjelse" the right word? I would like to apologize, That happened in the saloon the other day. Morton likes to bother, but sometimes they cross the line. It's already forgotten. Not Morton? - They pay for the damage Do you only come to say that? We are here also in another corner. Who is Thomas Moore? - I am. - This is your land. - Our. What do you mean by "our"? It stands in your name. I want to buy it from you. You do not work on it. And we will never do that either. Give it to me. - The earth is not for sale. - I offer 20,000. - It's a good deal ... - 30000. - You want to go, Tom? - No, dad got the ground. He loved the words: "The beautiful expanse." - Farvel, Austin. - Tink over it, kn gt. - If you change your mind. - Yes. Goodbye, sir. What is he going to do with more land? He is the state's richest quarterlands. - He's ready. - He knows that the soil is fertile. I know that as an agronomist. See how humid it is. Just man scratches in it, gives it a benefit. Tom, there are horses. - Oh no. - Not an expert. It will take a long time to turn him into a man. - Do not look fools. - What is it? It's about a Paul, There wrote letters to his neighbors. Not one of them answered him. They could only speak. Just look. Creepy not? Do not worry. It's an ant. You have written that letter for several days. I am writing to my professor, that the ants are slain in this country. They do not work so diligently here like elsewhere. - Is not that espionage? - It's scientific observations. Just write that they are smarter than other ants. Come outside. Okay. See. One can clearly see, that there is a horse. - He's yours. - Mine? Monkey wanted to remind him of yours initials, but we did not use it. He may have had a fortune. - No, we got him cheap. - What do you say? - He is the only one. Let's see, if you can hold the saddle. I rode in England when I was were ten, with dogs and trumpets. We have also been here, but trumpets are lacking. You can always play the violin! Get up in the saddle. - What's wrong? - You have no holes in the shoe. Stigb jlerne is a little too long, but it's going to happen. He rides a bit too much like a gentleman. Rid as you go in the Wild West In the same way as us. HOW. Good boy. Did I say goodbye to the saddle? - Yes, it was not calling me. Let's see, if you can support the fiddlers. Thanks, but what should I do? With that gun? There are many things, you can use it to. If a guy says you have to travel from the city, even if you do not feel like it. - Shall I shoot him? - Yes if he insists. Why do I have to go? You can not go round. - A man without a gun is not a man. - How is he s? He does not have any ... You know enough. I'm in, but it does not matter more against going around ... - Who was it? - You were probably mr. Austin's daughter. - It's lördag. We are going to town. - It's Sunday. - What does he do? He has become insane. When I return, we can discuss your unusual calendar. What should he use for, When does he collect butterflies? Does not he catch anyone with the net, can he throw them after them? I've never seen anyone catch a woman with a book. - Where are you going? - I need some fresh air. Keep guard. There is not much man in him, but he has the woman. It's better than nothing. It was the last time you acted, my friend. Where does the price save? He has an important corner. That was bad. We're waiting here. Yes, finally. It did not last long, well? - Can not we... - Low your vibe. Give off your soul and nature. Give off your strength and your courage. Give us what you have in your pockets and dirt otherwise we will break your bones. - Thank you, brother. Thanks. - Come on. - These are some good boys. - They are cool. - Candida Austin. - It's a beautiful name. You have a state name. Thomas Fitzpatrick Philip Moore. - Viscount of Essex.

This will be The White Horse Day. I dreamed of a white horse. You have a white horse. And tonight became a white horse the star of my father. - With my saddle - No, but a horse means nothing. - The most important thing is you're with me. - Yes, but a horse is ... If the horse ... The clock is many! Dad has enough sent people out to look for me. When can we be resumed? - Why can we see you again? - Music on Sunday. - I'm waiting for you here. - I just have to. I want to dream about you. Goodbye. Goodbye! - He's a s d girl. Fascinating. - I came by, so I wanted to Tell me what the dilemma is? - I do not travel anywhere. - Not that? Do you have one of the rolling chairs? With a seat between the wheels? No, but they seem quite inconvenient. If you're not the first diligence, Do you end up in a wheelchair? Did you throw a book after him? Yes, or did not he? Diligency again. Come on, Tom. He's totally welcome. - I have caught butterflies - En with a powerful hello. The knot is actually brave. Yes, but he knows well He's not gonna be with Morton. His father would have knocked Morton. - It's important to realize. He'd rather go there soon. This can not be continued. - You're good, are you? - Were it morton - It's bad that he needs you. - He's just jealous. - Hunting in the same butterfly? - Yes. It's time, that you learn to use that one. - I'd rather kill it. - Morton would probably be happy. Yes, Myself. And by the way, tomorrow you will deliver the horse and the saddle to its owner. Its owner? You do not think so, that I stole the horse and the saddle? - Yes. You neglected them. - What are you saying? I stole them. Did you really know the saddle? - Do you think I am stupid? - Hallo there. - Is it you? It is a miracle. Is this your saddle? - Yes. No, not really. It was stolen from a customer. - We found it. He lost it well? It's difficult when you sit on it. He was just getting drome. He was threatened with life and quickly get off the horse. Where can I buy a horse? - At my place. Come in and see. Will he buy one? Is not he nice? - No, we should not hesitate. Keep the dog for me. - It is an excellent horse. - I believe you, but ... I want a white horse. That's just it. Do you have one? I have one, but ... He's a little ... He is really ... I can not describe him. - Oh my gosh. He wants a living horse. - He lives. - He can not even stand up. - If you clap him, he's. - Now you exaggerate. He's just tired. - Really, Columbus. He is smart. He'd probably lost his mind. - What do you want? - Including the saddle? - Sadel plus horse will be 40 dollars. - We can bury him for ten. Okay, 30 dollars. Stop with to dig and give the horse saddle p. - He can give my tobacco a taste. - Perfect, he's sharp and tears. I'll be back and pick him up for a while. I always cough in the presence of horses. Okay, old boy. Pr v one last time. Hi, Tim. Hey, boys. How are you doing? This is Tom Smith, a friend. Do you try here? - Tim is the city's tambour. - You have shown a lot to do. - What is it for a post office? A new girl has arrived. Iris and her redhead are here. They came in. - Ar Speedy With? - Yes. Tom, her you must meet. She can only one thing ... ...but she's amazing good to it - Goodbye. I'm going to the bank. - I'm going with you. No thanks. I'm going alone. - Have you seen Austin's people, Tim? - Yes, they are all over the city. You will not ...? Your boyfriend looks to need ... shoes. Good morning, mr. Austin. - Is it you? Yes, that's fine. Is not it nice weather today? - Yes, very nice. - Warming, yet comfortable. - I will give you a free r d. Thank you, sir. Let my daughter be in peace, otherwise you will regret it. It was not a good r d. I regret. You'd better look to get away, while you still can. - Mr. Austin. - What's there, Morton? I finally found a wheelchair. Pardon! However, where I was clumsy. I took the Englishman Maureens head between his hands. Kissed her on her brow and said, "Thanks." Afterwards he coughed and died. - And Maureen? She took it very heavily. She loved him right now. She would never wash again. To maintain the smell of his shaving cream on his skin. The poor girl. Now she is stinking. Up with hummer. Now comes the knot. Come and join us, Tom. - It's Iris and Speedy. - It's one of me. - Where have you been? - I hope everything is fine. - The whole is tip top. I need your help, Speedy. - Have a drink Quickly. They found your shoes under the bed. What do you think, Tom? I want to teach them better to know first. Are you now Ebenezer? It is unhealthy to do it on the full stomach. Are you with Morton? Have you decided, Tom? Do you stay here or do you travel stp? - I want to stay here. - Find a girl and foster family. I intend to do that. Have you found a little g s? She is not g s. She is a swan. A beautiful white swan. - A swan sounds like ... Still, you can hug. Is r if it's the swan, we have in mind. Look at me with those eyes. You are s s d. A woman would love to lay in your arms ... Be quiet! Now it is enough. I have said that I do not want to bump in here. Get up. I am talking to you. - Me? - Yes. The dj is not so ugly, as you say. He's waiting for you outside. Come on, please! He just wants to provoke. Come on, your coward. Do not get rid of him. - He called me a coward. Rather a living coward than one d d completely. I am waiting! - Different, ma'am. See you later. - Yes. That said the day before your wedding. We have not seen him since. Will you...? Come with you. Quickly. - Good something. - It is too late. He's a bad guy. I know him. I am waiting. Collect the revolver. - Why? - What do you mean? You are a gentleman? Wait, Tommy. Morton, you forgot something. - Do tell him what it's like. - Good it yourself. That simple, Tom. As soon as you go the revolver, he'll kill you. Not true, Morton? - It's right. Can not I pick it up? - He walks when you ride it. I have never held a man, and he's sick to dream me? - Are you afraid? - Em so I am. - So dirty with you. I could not dream about that. Fantastic, Morton! You are a great shooter. - Is the show over? Come down and gather the revolver. Do you think I'm crazy? - Morton! Came. Now it is enough. The first time I'll kill you. Are you following? - What happened? - He said you were afraid. He was right. Shall we go? It is embarrassing, but I'm going to change underneath. He was not afraid. He was scratched. You cheat when you're in trouble. - It does not harm anyone? Think about your health instead of playing with ants. You're in danger, well. The ants are more important for mankind than morton - Is r because they can not shoot. - Be quiet. I concentrate. A man who has become a relationship to its creator should not cheat. What an evening. - And see the moon. - Perfect relationships to begin Do not you think about anything else? Why Do not you have a good job? What are you going to do, Tom? I will be here. I want to create a perfect ranch. And you three will help me driving it. Give me the best. Even Morton works. He is a pig, but he works. He wants the biggest piece of wildlife and will not let you grab it. He thinks you are fit. When they're married, Austin is in one Accident, and Morton takes over everything. Get up, please. It is late. You... Come on, your lazy kitty. - Ah, Tom! - Hi. You and I will talk to you later. Excuse the delay. I do not know, What's the matter with him today? Should not we meet us? Is there anything in the way, Candida? What I feared most, has been done. What happened? Trust me. My father ... wants to have, that I marry Morton. - How awesome! - Yes, but what can I do? He is old and tired and want a strong man in the house. One can manage the ranch. If that man ands is my husband, They will be happy. Yes, you can count on it. - I can persuade your father. - After what happened in town? - He's how willing I was. - No, it did not appear at all. For him is a man, no chewing tobacco Spears long or shoot holes in the tines he finds- - not a real man. Is he an expert in tindoes? - Morton can hit everything. Even the crowds are quiet, when he comes There is not a separate newspaper on the earth there is no through hole. Tom, my love. Let's escape by far. - It is impossible. - S'm, we say goodbye here and now. - I do not want to blame you for your sake. - There's a problem. - I know it is. - Yes. The reading is found in the last verse of the poem you never finished- - We'll see each other on the train first time "Smile for your love is coming ..." Your love comes. You have given me love Therefore, I give you love Unseen passion, love Your love comes. You've given me love, therefore, I give you Unseen passion, love Unseen passion, love. Lord Byron knew everything. Not all. You left the dirty work to us, angels. Are you feeling well? Unseen passion, love What's wrong with the knee? What are you doing? How works the damn thingest? That worked. I do not know why you've changed opinion, but you have a good reason. You are right. I want to crush Morton Clayton like a flower between the poetry pages. There is action behind the words. - Where are we going? - What do you mean? Now, of course. Socked you like a man for a change. I'm not going to carnival! - Empty. Tom FiztPhil Moore. This is your father's thief, as he carried during our last r veri. Wondering, why did he change his mind? - It was probably not Morton. - No. - He looks like his father. Come on, Tom. It's like seeing the angel again. The pants are perfect. - They go back a bit. It is better, if you are going to sit down. And now for the task. I teach you to sl s. Monkey explains, why optimism does not work. Saint-Joe explains the rest. - I'm ready. You never forget the reason, that you sl s. Why are you smiling? Let's begin. Never trust anyone. Not even your best friend. Forstet? Are you sure? Let's give it a hand. It was unfair! You do not need to pair with k ben. Use your arms. Now he is not too bad at him. - No. Take care of this! Try again. Are you ready? Get angry by the way. Remember why you're angry. Now it starts to look something like that. Up with the parades. - I have not learned you. - Never trust anyone. There's food there. - How are you feeling? - Fint when I'm ready with him. Now you have to take over. Where are you going, Bull? - I'm gone for a while. Continued exercise. They cursed Ants behave like ants. - What ants? - The first kind. - It is not useful to spear? - You have become clever, well. - See you. Good luck. - Goodbye. Good, junior. Let's get started. Do you know what an optimist is? A man in a chest with his hands on the chest. Keep your eyes closed and stay awake. That's the case at the leg. Can I make a sliji? - Yes, you are. I'm ready. Why are you staring at me? - To things make a man sweat. See him as if you intend to take him to the place. Or smile like you is very confident. - Are you following? - Yes. Pr v now. - You better smile, Tom. - I think so, too. Now, see how I'm going. When you go, do you go too? The cock back to save time. It's easy enough. Speed ​​and Action = X Ym, since the energy factor is not known. Yes, that's right. Shoot after the bell over there. No, I want to hit the tind. - Really? - Yes. It was pure luck. - You have not told everything about yourself. - It's pretty easy. To shoot without aiming. Theoretically speaking should I be able to hit it? If you point to an object Do it in a straight lane. And here the revolver replaces his finger. Are you in? Now try to point out. See for yourself. You have the right to God. He is right. - It requires some to be done. - It was what I said. The shoes I bought from you, Iris, Iris. Are we going to have a drink? - Not here. We sit down. I want the money back. - What is it? - Maureen. I've been upstairs. How was Phoenix going? You were right that it was him. - I recognized him around. He did not pay Irene, and two days Later, I am, he was wanted. I'm getting her money. - Forget it. How is the knee it? He is about to be ready. He has good friends. Give me a drink He will already travel? He is a clever guy. He could not do anything else. I'm coming and saying goodbye. Do you do that? When do we feel? You there! If you come along, you're welcome. - Click in and wait. - What did he say? Here comes the passenger. Pardon. The dilemma awaits you, Moore. - Will you or not? - Click in and wait. Come with you! They're waiting for you, my friend. - You must leave. I will be here. - What do you say? You heard what I said. Stand them, Dad. - Morton's killing him. - If he's doing the dilemma. You have ten seconds to disappear from here. Today, I'm killing you, Moore. Udmrket. Just try. I turn around, s is easier for you. He hit the spot. Morton. You should not just stand there. I have only one ball back. Do you know with the dilemma or not? This may be the case for you to change meaning. When he gives signs, throw the revolver to him. Tom is a viscount father. Forget him, Morton. He is a viscount. Hey here, old man. You clap! Do not you want to go on, Morton? - Whenever you go. I'm gonna blow you flat as a bookmark. I wanted to change tactics, if I were you. Speed ​​plus action creates energy. M we are now, sir? He said no. - It's not going to call. - You said, I did not. Do not forget lesson number three, Tom. - It's not coming in. - Pardon. No, Morton ... - Live down there. How many times have I said, that I do not want to bother here? Stay where you are, otherwise come Never to regain you. Come on, Tom. I'm yours if you win. I surrender myself. Do you ask for something? Is that what you say? - How much does he owe you? - Ti dollars. But forget that. She said, that you should forget it. Go in and see what they are doing. St not just there. - Should I? - Yes. - It looks friendly from here. - Go back to your place. They are well-trained. You're in the way. A garde. Touch. Not bad, Tom. Not bad. - Thanks. - Mo we are now? - Move. We have some new passengers. Come on with you guys. It should not last all day. Here is a farewell gift. What is it? It's kind of a ticket to our friend, he can travel. - My Goodness. - Yes. - I knew he was in need. - You know how it is. Why did not you say anything? We just wanted to ... ...for sure, that you did it yourself. I am in. Kr. I have changed. Now, it is your turn. Let's go home. Empty... We travel on. - Ar the ants arrived? - Yes. We are in 1880. You can not avoid it evolution forever. The Wild West does not exist anymore. When we can see the sunset, There is the West. We're pretty simple due to the sunset. I would wish you were right. You will come back We can work together. You are stable. - I'm waiting for you. Lets go. Keep the dog as I get up. Goodbye. Well, Tom. - Good luck. - I'm waiting for you. - We are in the Promised Land. - Let us pick flowers. - Not now. Thank you, Lord, because you have told us a West ... Hold on! The idea was right. - The road's path is unreasonable. Let's ride back.
