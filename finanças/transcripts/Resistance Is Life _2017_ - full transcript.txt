[background chatter] MUNICIPALITY OF SURUCÇ ARIN MIRXAN TENT CITY Do you want me to talk to you? My name is Evlin and I'm from Kobane. We are here because ISIS bombed us. ISIS came to slaughter us and we fled. The children were little so they couldn't run away fast. We escaped slowly and reached the border. Then the gates opened and we crossed into Turkey. Thank you. [melancholic music] [baby crying] [TV] ISIS has launched massive attacks -on the city of Kobane. -[loud explosion] ISIL is a terrorist organization. Pure and simple. It has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way. [English reporter] Outgunned and outnumbered, Kurdish men and women of Kobane are resisting against ISIS. They are calling for support in the fight against the Islamic State. [gunshots] [in English] They are not enemy against only us, they are enemy against humanity. -They are against history. -[gunshots] [reporter] Kobane is located just a stone's throw away from the border with Turkey. [English reporter 2] Islamic State fighters are taking their battle into... [English reporter 3] The U.S. has been pressing Turkey to take a more active role... [Erdogan] Problems cannot be solved with airstrikes. Several months have passed with no results. As of now, Ayn al-Arab, also known as Kobane, is about to fall. It's falling. [distant explosion] Until ISIS is defeated from here, we are going to resist together everywhere. [crowd chanting] Long live the resistance of Kobane! Long live the resistance of Kobane! [chanting continues] Long live the resistance of Kobane! [haunting vocal music] [background chatter] [woman] Where are you coming from Evlin? [Evlin] City center. I have two brothers. Hemude and Mustafa. Hemude is six years old. And Mustafa is five months old. [giggling] My parents and I... we are in this camp. Trying to survive here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! [kids chant in unison] [applause] [Evlin] We are learning in Kurdish. We are going to learn the alphabet from A to Z. [excited shouts] Our school is nice. On our break we play with our teacher. We find solace in playing. [all shout and laugh] I'm learning how to read and write now. It's my goal to educate myself. Without education, you have nothing. [shouting and laughing] [Evlin indistinct] After school I help out my mother. My mother cares for me, and I care for her, too. Everyone should care for their mother. It is working! [background chatter] My name is Newroz and I'm Evlin's mother. We are from Sheran Village. They informed us that ISIS was a village away from us in Tilejbe. They announced from the mosque that women and children should flee the village immediately. It is better that we save our honor before something happens. We must flee before they arrive. And the men who wanted to fight stayed in the village. I called my brother and asked if they were fleeing to Turkey, and whether I could go with them. He said yes and asked where my husband was. I said Aladdin was not at home. I was at the fight in the beginning in Tell Abyad in Northern Syria. During the heavy combat we didn't break. ISIS couldn't break us, and they never will. But the part that broke me personally was my children. As a father of these children, I broke apart. One part of me was with them, and the other was in the battle. [repeated firing] [in English] Daesh is in this village, about a kilometer away from here. It's down this road. I can show you. I'm scared enough that I can protect myself. But I'm not so scared of them, that I'd hide from them, run away from them. I will face them wherever I can. We have many comrades here who joined YPG who are not Kurdish originally. I have met three comrades from Germany. They were born and grew up in Germany. But they saw what happened to the Kurdish people and they came here. And I've seen a lot of American citizens. A few British citizens, Canadians, and Australians. They come because... the pain is so massive. The scale of the brutality is so big. So many people are trying to defend this right. I told my comrade, a guerilla commander, that I wanted to go see my children that night. He said, "Sure, you can go." I started the engine of my pickup truck, which was loaded with ammunition. I arrived at my village and my family was not there. They told me that my family went to the city of Kobane. Kobane was liberated from Syria's Ba'athist Regime on July 19th, 2012. We have established a democratic self-rule. It was peaceful here. Everyone wanted to live in Kobane. There were Armenians, Turks, Arabs and Kurds. There was a brotherhood and a unity here. After one year of democratic self-rule, some dark and chauvinistic powers attacked Kobane. They launched attacks on Kobane on July 20th, 2013. -[engines roaring] -[gunshots] [people yelling] [explosion] After the fall of Mosul, Raqqa and other major military bases in Syria... ISIS started attacking Kobane from all three sides. [repeated firing] With hundreds of tanks and Humvees that they stole from Mosul, and with thousands of fighters, they attacked Kobane. [men shouting] So we had to pull the civilians out of Kobane to prevent a genocide. As ISIS got closer, most of the people fled to Northern Kurdistan. When I went to Kobane... I didn't see my children again. Once again, I returned to my village. I said goodbye to my parents and I left. I met with my brother and my parents and we went to the border. Before crossing the border, my son Hemude got lost. I was very worried crossing the border without my son. It was very crowded and devastating. Babies in cribs were crying. Elderly people were holding hands. Elderly people were carried on shoulders. When I saw all this, I broke down and cried. You didn't say, we made it. [background chatter] Emine, come here. We should attach it together. Wait! Let me do it. [kids sing] It doesn't count. It hit Emine's hand. Be quiet. I'll kick you out if you don't. [TV] There are no words that can explain the war in Kobane. It's a very inhuman and cruel war. It's a dirty war on the people of Kobane. Despite the heavy attacks by ISIS, the people of Kobane continue to resist. [Newroz] When I was in Kobane my niece came up to me and said Aladdin was killed. Then I looked my mother-in-law in the eye, and she asked me if I had heard anything. We were both hiding the truth from each other. She insisted that I had heard something. I said I had and asked, "Is it true that Aladdin is killed?" She said, "Daughter, I heard it too, but I couldn't tell you." I began to cry... I looked at my little boy, and said... "I don't know if your dad is dead or alive." I was already heartbroken when I set foot in Turkey. I just wanted to see him, dead or alive. Was it recording? [giggles] The first crossings started on September 19th. I was there at Ohan Village on the Turkish side. We were there in solidarity and ISIS had just gotten closer. Everyday four to five thousand people were literally jumping over the fence to this side. [cacophony of voices] They left their cars and animals behind, because Turkish soldiers didn't allow them. They were forced to abandon all their belongings. They only brought their children and some clothes. I was not scared on the border at all. Why should I be? [shouting] Syrians are not allowed to cross. Some of them have relatives in Turkey. And they want to cross. This is causing great tension. And now Turkish forces are firing tear gas at Syrian people. [Evlin] When we stepped into Turkey we regretted it. My mother said she can't bear it here. My mom said we should return. After crossing to the Turkish side, I told my family that I wanted to go back. My brother got upset and asked me why. He said, "We are all here, including your children. Why do you want to go back?" You said... You said it was because of your husband. Come on. You are not telling it all. [children shout and laugh] [camera clicks] -[camera clicks] -[Evlin] Like a journalist. I take pictures of my friends and my teachers. I take pictures of interesting things. The pain is heavy. I take pictures of the pain around me. [boy] Evlin, take a picture of me! [camera clicks] Evlin! [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [Evlin giggles] [Aladdin] We are in the 21st century. And you might think that no one is enslaved. Even animals... have a freedom and life. But in this day and age, we are in a tent. Both the people of Kobane and Sinjar. I say enough to blood suckers. They should look at these children. What have they done to deserve this? [Newroz] The first week was very hard for me. I was always crying. I was wondering how my children would survive. It's winter and it's very cold. How can my children survive in tents? I said, "We can't live here." But people here came and helped us. The people of Suruç opened their arms to the people of Kobane, both to children and the elderly. People are really nice here. They are taking care of us very well. At the wedding hall people are helpful. [in English] Oops, sorry. [Evlin] Volunteers will come and bring us food and drinks. We are fed. We are thankful to those people. [in Italian] Olives! We are two groups of Italians that met in Kurdistan. We are here for two reasons: The first is to gather information on what's really happening in Kurdistan, aside from what mainstream mass media tells us in Italy. The second important reason is to create a political connection with the Kurds. We really believe in this experiment in radical democracy that begins with the people. We believe in this democracy, and we are here in Kurdistan to show our solidarity. When people of Kobane crossed to this side, most of the help came from municipalities of DBP, which governs the municipalities of Kurdistan. Volunteers, people of conscience who felt affected by the situation in Kobane, and people that are against ISIS, helped us. [speaking in Kurdish] [Zuhal] The advantage of Kobane and Suruç is that we speak the same Kurdish language. We are the same people. There is no difference between us. This is also their homeland. [narrator] The Kurdish people are the largest ethnic group in the world without a state. An estimated 40 million Kurdish people live in the world today. Kurds are not considered Arabs, Turks, nor Persians and have their own language and culture. They were ruled under the Ottoman and Persian Empires. After World War I with the collapse of the empires and the birth of nation-states, the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres guaranteed the Kurds their own country. It was signed but never ratified. The emerging Turkish state under the leadership of Kemal Atatuürk was opposed to Kurdish autonomy, and the colonial powers agreed to divide Kurdistan among the new, emerging states. In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne was enacted and established the modern borders of today's Middle East, which did not include a Kurdish state. The Kurdish homeland was divided with parts ruled by Turkey and Iran, as well as the French Mandate for Syria and the British Administration of Iraq. Both sides are Kurdistan. But colonial powers and capitalists separated us with a fence for their own profits. It's painful to live by these rules. It strips the freedom from our hands. It's broken here and we are trying to fix it. We face something new here every day. We wake up with the sound of explosions. People get numb to the sound of explosions. People broke through the fences at the border to come here. But now they live in a fenced area. This dirty war made people... I can't continue.

[TV] The resistance of Kobane has changed not only Kurdish lives, but also the entire Middle East. Colonial powers and beneficiaries of this war had different plans. They want to take over Kobane and all the other cantons of Northern Syria. But the resistance of Kobane is a game-changer.

They underestimated how united the Kurds are. They thought they could break Kobane in one day. Even if only one Kurd remains, we will fight for Kobane. [Evlin] We stand for solidarity on the border. We love our comrades and we shout. The people here also stood with us for Kobane. [Selahattin] Willpower from all over the world has become one.

The whole world should know that my homeland is pleasant. [woman continues wailing] [repeated firing and explosions] [firing intensifies] [kids chatting] [gunshots] My name is Menal. I am the bride of Kobane. We didn't want to leave and let the enemy take our city. We stayed here and didn't allow that. Despite the heavy war and clashes, I stood with my little children. No matter what, we haven't given up. I stayed on the front lines for 17 days, with my children and the comrades. And I helped them as much I could. [laughing] We can be cold, we can be hungry... we can face anything, but we won't leave Kobane in the enemy's hands. Suleiman! Come back home. ISIS has been bombing us. The have been firing bullets at us. One rocket fell over there but it didn't explode. [boy 3] Another one hit a bus and broke its window, but it didn't explode either. There is a mortar here, too. [firing] Please follow me Uncle, I will show it to you. It fell over there and didn't explode. Look, it's here. It hasn't exploded yet. [planes roar] [sporadic firing] [Evlin] Remember how we played at home in Kobane? Me, you and Sidra. I wish we never left, but had stayed in our village and played. [explosion] It sounded like a mortar. [festive music] MUNICIPALITY OF SURUCÇ ARIN MIRXAN TENT CITY [children laugh] [laughter] [Ilker] One of the reasons I'm here is to show children the existence of other worlds, with an art that doesn't require a language. Here, there is a war on one side and life on the other. I am trying to show that side. I'm not trying to make them forget the war. That's something else entirely, and perhaps that's not my job. But I am trying to show a world with playgrounds, balloons and seesaws for the children. Despite everything, their smiles are the strongest weapon against the war. In meetings, agreements, and the news, the world has failed Kobane. But we believe it's not going to fall. Because if Kobane falls, then so will life. We are going to win this war with smiling children. And we will continue our activities in our backyards. In the streets of Kobane. [children singing] [laughter] [TV] With heavy artillery guns, Kurdish Peshmerga forces from Iraq have crossed into Kobane from Suruç to help YPG fighters. The Peshmerga commander gave thanks for the support they received on the road. [English reporter 4] Peshmerga, or "those who confront death" seen here crossing the border from Northern Iraq to Turkey in the early hours of Wednesday morning. [Aladdin] Evlin, come help your father. I'm going to cook eggs, my daughter. It may be little but count it as a feast. We are in a small tent, but our hearts are big. [melancholic music] [radio] On the 76th day of the resistance in Kobane ISIS attacked Kobane from all four sides. One of the attacks came from the border gate. They attacked with a suicide tank. It happened in the past, too. But this time, ISIS entered from Turkish soil. My name is Arin and I'm a public security officer. We are here to check vehicles because ISIS has set up many booby traps. We do not allow civilians to pass through until the traps are cleared. We watch out for suicide cars, too. I'm 18 years old. My family is in Turkey. I was here with my father. When the suicide tank exploded at the border gate, my father was killed. [distant explosions and firing] I came from Kobane 22 days ago. The war and the battle still continues. As you and the rest of the world must know, many say that they are against ISIS today, yet ISIS still gets support from the Turkish border. A suicide tank crossed the Turkish border into Kobane and it exploded in a civilian area. How can this happen? I am calling for international attention. [voice breaks] I'm calling... [woman begins singing] ♪ Ankara, the capital of Turkey Is aware of everything ♪ ♪ The Turkish government Is not innocent ♪ ♪ They are part of the massacre Taking place in Kurdistan ♪ ♪ Kurdish lives are burning...

Kurdish anger has spread beyond Turkey, though, to many European nations, too. [in English] Who's selling our women as sex slaves? [all] ISIS! [girl] Who's killing children? [all] ISIS! -Who's the terrorist? -[all] ISIS! Evlin, what are you drawing? A bride. Her name is Kobane. We caught an ISIS militant on Ramadan. We were taking him with us in the car. We took him to the public security office. A guerrilla comrade named Midya was there. When she walked in, the ISIS militant shut his eyes. He looked away and asked us to take her out. He said, "As a Muslim man, I can't look at women." Comrade Midya smiled and said she would leave. Then suddenly he turned around and looked at comrade Midya. The ISIS militant told Midya, "You are one of the virgins from heaven. I am dead and the Kurds didn't capture me." He asked, "Where are the other 39 virgins?" Midya smiled and told him, "They are under my command. They will come in soon and you will see them." This just shows the mentality of ISIS militants. In this era... they have such narrow minds. [Evlin sings wordlessly] ♪ Kobane is united Hand in hand ♪ ♪ They fight day and night ♪ YPJ raised its flag And began to resist... ♪ [Hevjin] I've been in Kobane for ten months now. Being here is very special, especially for the YPJ fighters. When you look at the battle, there are lots of female leaders. Their resistance is a big inspiration for us. It also inspires male fighters. Leadership begins with women. Their strength, resistance, and morale makes us feel much stronger. [Evlin] Our comrades at war are pushing ISIS out, for us to return home. Long live the resistance of YPG and YPJ. [women chanting] Long live the resistance of YPJ! Long live the resistance of YPJ! Long live the resistance of YPJ! [chanting continues] Long live the resistance of Kobane! Long live the resistance of Kobane! [Ayse] The fight for Syria's freedom, the fight for Western Kurdistan's freedom, is the fight for women's freedom. Thousands of women have been raped, thousands of women have been slaughtered, and thousands of women have been kidnapped. And no one stood for the women of Syria. That's why the revolution in Western Kurdistan is led by women. Even today, in many Western countries, what some women don't realize is that freedom is not only about one's look. It's not about physical beauty. But YPJ does not think this way. YPJ started with the concept that freedom is something that begins in the mind. A woman's true beauty is found in her mind. It's in her intellect. It's in her perspective. [coughing] I'm not crying, it's the smoke. Don't we have gas here? Unlike fighting in the mountains, our comrades didn't have any experience in urban warfare. But we have gained a lot of experience now. Long before I joined the movement, I accepted death. Our commitment to our leader and to our fallen comrades gives us the strength to fear nothing. I save this final bullet in case the enemy captures me. It's better that I end my own life. Even 40-50 year old Kurdish women picked up a weapon and fought against ISIS. They stood with the YPG and YPJ fighters on the front lines. They didn't want to leave their children to fight alone. The pains of all women are great, but those of Kurdish women are greater, because they all have a wound in their heart. Their wound is their martyrs. Today every family has at least two, three or four members killed. Despite all this, Kurdish women continue to join the resistance. And when we talk about women's rights, we stand and resist for the women of the world. -Women, life, freedom! -[ululating cheers] Women of Pirsus, Kobane, Kurdistan and Turkey, I welcome you all from the bottom of my heart. [cheering] We are on the border of Kobane. Comrades of YPG and YPJ can hear our support. Let's cheer for them. The National Council of Syria had a meeting in Istanbul yesterday. They have criticized Moscow's initiative in inviting members of the opposition. They ask that only the representatives of the people of Syria be invited. May God help us. -Are you going to school? -[Evlin] Yes. -Who is your teacher? -Teacher Ruken. -Is she from Kobane? -Yes. Aren't you late? Your friends are going. No grandpa, we have a play today.

The last time was in my homeland, in Kobane. Two of my children are still in the battle now. ISIS slaughters and beheads our friends. I saw it with my own eyes. This is not a story. Comrade Mustafa, father of five kids, was killed. He was beheaded. I witnessed it all. When we catch the enemy, because of our traditions, values and belief in our movement, we don't kill or behead anyone. We try to introduce ourselves. We are not the enemy of any person. And we will never show enmity towards others. They are saying that I'm old and should rest, but I don't agree. Comrades ask me why I keep returning. I told them I want to fight. I told them I want to defend my homeland. I told them I will fight even with one hand. I want to stand next to my comrades. The young men and women on the front lines are like my children.

And we honor the fallen ones. They left us bright days ahead. Men and women of Kobane fought until the end. A major part of the resistance in Kobane was led by women. In Kobane, they stood against tanks, and against ISIS, the greatest savages. Young women fought to prevent even a single braid falling into the hands of ISIS. For example, Arin Mirxan sacrificed herself to prevent ISIS from taking over Mistenur Hill, just like many other fighters and commanders of the YPJ. It may hurt some male fighters to hear this... but believe me, 70 to 80 percent of our victory was led by women. Resistance of women. There was a big battle when I came to Kobane. Especially in the city. We were not as technically advanced as the enemy, but our spirit and energy were greater. We honored the fallen and we moved forward. Our confidence kept getting stronger and now we are liberating the villages. The enemy saw that the only option they had left was to retreat. We all know that ISIS has lost. As they retreat they might try to attack other towns around Kobane. We will face them anywhere as the fighters of the YPG and YPJ. Long live the resistance of YPG and YPJ! [chuckling] [kids chatting] People are leaving for Kobane. The tents are ruined. And children are happy because they created a playground from the leftovers of the tents. [laughter] I have less friends now. I love the ones who were here before. I miss them. Now their tents are empty, they all left for Kobane. And I'm left with few friends.

I did not leave Kobane. The battle started on September 14th, and since that time, I've been here. Following the liberation of Kobane, families have been returning day by day. And we want all of them to return. The love for Kobane is rooted in our children and in our families. If Kobane was not liberated, then children and families wouldn't be free. They are all connected to one another. [ululating cheer] [Enwer] After all it was a big battle... A historical battle. Whoever is hurt by the sufferings of the men, women and children of Kobane, should stand with us and help Kobane for the sake of humanity. They should help spread the voice of Kobane to all the organizations and governments around the world. Kobane sacrificed for the world in the fight against terrorism. Due to our sacrifices, we are facing a catastrophe now. We need logistical, medical, infrastructural and educational help. Eighty percent of the city is completely destroyed. Eighty percent of the villages are vandalized. I am hoping people will help and embrace Kobane. It's the symbol of resistance against global terror. We need your help. That's all I can say. [background chatter] I went to the school. They gave me my report card. The school is finished. I'm at home now. EXCELLENT [ALL GRADES] [giggles] Hopefully we can return home in two or three months.
