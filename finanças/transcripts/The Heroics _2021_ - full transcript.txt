Is it my turn? - We hear you, Michelle. Okay, so... Sorry. My name is Michelle, an alcoholic and drug addict. I can not take it any more. I can not stand. My girlfriend left me. I have been detoxing from methadone for four months. I was on methadone for 22 years. They told me it was worse than heroin - two weeks. Four and a half months of abstinence! Greater nastiness I have never experienced. I was left alone. We have a 10 month old baby. The mother is on the other side of Paris. I take the baby every other weekend. I can not any more! I'm 53, 50 kilos, skin and bones! When I'm with the baby, I'm sick of insomnia. I can barely stay on my feet, I'm getting exhausted. Just fell asleep, and the baby wakes up. I haven't had two hours of sleep. How will I drive it? It's unbelievable! Sorry, but I'm furious. I already have a boy. I shouldn't have been a father. I didn't want a second child. I have a child with this woman because I wanted to be with her. And not to leave me. The baby was born and she left. I don't want to start again. The big... What happened - happened. We've already talked about that. Let's remember the past, but not regret it. OK! But I had a hard time with my son. Many of you know it. I've done bad things. And now I realize it. I try to accept it and not repeat my mistakes. So I wanted to be clean for the damn baby. But not without her, dammit. Not quite alone. I don't want to get stuck again. But now... I don't know if I want to get drunk or... I want this to end. I'm sick of suffering. I want this to end. To say: "Fuck abstinence". Let me come here and tell you: "I'm not clean". I'm not clean anyway. Excuse me. Father! Damn it! Dad, are you sleeping? I'm coming. Do not rush. Shit, it's so cold! - Yes. Let's hurry! Grab the wheels. Grab the front wheels. Slowly. - It is very cold. Come on. do you hold - Yes. Let's not wake him. Why aren't you dressed? It's noon! Did you sleep? - No. Don't wake him up! It's 12 o'clock! - Yes, I'm coming. This is my jacket, give it to me! - You're in your pants! You can't wear it! I have a reputation in the neighborhood. Reputation?! - I'm not giving it to you! Help me! - Have you had coffee? I'm not. - Shit! What? - You owe me 10 euros. Here! Do you hear how it works? That's exactly how it should sound. Can you smell it? It's ideal. The mixture is excellent. I'll turn the screw a little more. What are you doing? - I reduce the idle speed. Do you see how they adjust? A moment ago the bars were rattling. They work great now. Should I let go? - Yes. Stand in the back. You tell me when. - Wait. Hold the door. Take it easy! Push, push! Is this your resume? - Yes. You can't show up with that. Why? - Do you have a high school diploma? I have the level. - You can't write it. She'll know you don't have a degree. - How? I have the level. Dad, you can't start with "1984 - master plasterer". It was my first job. Small task paid under the table? - It's work again. I can plaster. - You did it once! No, I worked for a while. - Shut up! Looking for a job as a mechanic? Yes, on motorbikes. - Okay. Just to clarify two things. "Marital status" - you marked "other" and "single". Yes, I live alone. So "unmarried". - Okay. You cannot select both. Two dependent children. - Boys. But you noted that they live with their mother. Yes, my eldest son is of age. They are from different mothers. The little one is with his. - Okay, I understand. Two mothers. Can I have your resume? Of course. Thanks. No degree. No degree. Look... Mr. Kowalski, to be a mechanic you need a qualification. This is not serious. - But why? Do you have a mechanic certificate? No, but just give me a bike and you'll see. You have a plumber certificate. - Faucets don't appeal to me. I want to fix vintage bikes. I have a garage where I work. I make frames. I weld, fix the structure. It's great that you are so enthusiastic. But you need an official document. You have to go through training. Damn the helmets. Give me the little one. Here it is. - A moment. Come on, pull up the blanket. Pull! - Yes. Take it again. - Right. Carefully. Give me these things. How was it? - Very good. How did you come? On foot. - Michelle, don't make a fool of me. What are you talking about? - I'm not deaf. I can't mistake the sound of your bike. Only half an hour... - Can't! Baby on a motorcycle on a slippery road! Aren't you crazy?! If you do that again, I won't give it to you anymore. It smells like gasoline. Were you in the garage? What are you doing? I opened the window. - Open the window. Why isn't he at school? The school sucks. Your mother and I have been trying to find a good major for you. Not true! Go to school! - Come on, go! I'll tell your mother. - I'm going. Bye! Bye! I know I know... It startled him. Deer? I want to show you something. Look what I got tattooed! "Doubt, my dear, in the earth, in the sun, in the starry swarm, doubt..." What does it say below? - I do not see. "Doubt the holy truth, but nivga - in that I am yours!" William Shakespeare. I made it for you. I can not. Why? Grow up! I keep doing it! - Enough! Grow up at last! Can't you see the effort I'm making? I don't hang out with geeks. I don't take anything, I stopped everything. I did it for you and the baby. - No, Michelle! Not because of the child! You're doing it for yourself! Don't dump all your problems on us! Can't you tell I'm exhausted? I need to rest my head on someone's shoulder too. Whose? - Not yours. I can't take apart your mother's cupboard by myself. You still have luggage. Next time, don't forget the allowance. Forty-nine. - You've lost more weight. Does it hurt? - Hellish. Your liver is overloaded. Your hands are cold again. - And my legs too. To see the language. Put some clothes on. Are you able to sleep? Two hours each, three at the most. And when you're with the baby? - It's even worse with him. If you want, we can increase the sleeping pills. I'll give you a benzodiazepine. Then we'll do an abdominal scan. Michelle, are you listening to me? You've been rocking for 40 years. Getting off methadone at 53 is just amazing. No one from the center has succeeded. There's no way you can recover in 10 months. Your body has to learn to live without drugs. Do you agree? And don't be alone. Leo is with you, isn't he? Yes. I am everything, you are nothing. I am almighty, you are nothing. I don't want to be a rock star, all the rappers will breathe my dust! Paris-Dakar with "Dragstar", in a clean livery suit. The 12 heavens protect me, the Earth like Atlas I support. I am a terminator, indestructible, unattainable to you. Cloclo saw in Alexandria a vagrant Nazi and filth. You are a steam engine, I am a powerful turbine. I take over the game, I take over the baton. You will run like in GTA, don't you dare compete with me. With the prophets I live, the demons I rule. With adversities my path was strewn, with a little magic I blow away any presumptuous. I am everything, you are nothing. I am almighty, you are nothing. Guys, I want to tell you something. You are great, but sometimes it is not understood. Put your finger in your mouth. Do you know the number with your finger? You put your finger in your mouth. This helps you speak more clearly. Right? - But not the whole finger. That's how you train your muscles. Then you will be able to rap in Japanese. I am everything, you are nothing. I am almighty, you are nothing. I am everything, you are nothing. I am almighty, you are nothing. Exactly! I understand you now! Hello? What do you want? Now? Thanks. It's sugar free. Is that okay? - Yes thank you. It started in mid-July. The results came out in August. His whole body is affected. The liver too. Lungs, bones, everything. What are we going to do? - In what sense? How will we take care of him? I don't know, you're his chick. - I'm not his "chick". I have no money. - It's not about money. We can take turns caring for him so he doesn't feel alone. Don't you think I have time to watch it? Do I look like a crappy nanny to you? Can't you speak normally? - Don't get all worked up. Is it "foaming"? Do you consider yourself a big man? Why are you here then? - It's normal for me to come, you called me. He is your father! You owe him after everything you've done to him! Grow up! I'm leaving. - Come for a while. Sit down. What are you going to do with it? These are mom's pills. I don't want to die in that place. These will only stun you. Look on the cupboard. An envelope. Open it. They'll make it to the dealers, won't they? You might find me something to help me go. It shouldn't be a problem for you, right? Your spleen is enlarged. You have kidney stones. Your immune system is down. You need to talk to Ellen because of the child. Yes. - It's important, Michelle. Get out! - I don't bring alcohol. Indeed. - Lily, if it's alcohol, get out. It's water. Do you carry gin in your bag? - Michelle, don't! Do you consume here? - Who are you? I'm the one struggling to stop drinking and hanging out. You will not drink here! - Let me go! Are you crazy? Get out! - He's crazy! You're crazy! Give me back my bag, you base thief! You can't drink here! Michelle, calm down! - Do you think you are very important? Yes, I'm crazy! And what will you do? I'm pregnant. God, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to see the difference between them. Thanks. I noticed you didn't say the prayer. - I don't need God. You don't need anyone. Is that why you're here? I do not want to bother you. The prayer is for the group. Take it. - Is that the Bible? No, "Think about each day". One thought a day. If you read one every morning, maybe it will become your Bible. My number is inside. Yes, I'm fine. We are the children of the Earth Looks good. Hi Michelle. - Hello guys. Bye, Dad. - Why bye"? I'll sleep at Tak's. Right? - Yes. You said you would sleep here. - Actually, I'm not going to sleep here. Why? - I do not know... I can't take it here anymore. Can't stand it? - The bench is hard, it's uncomfortable. I'll give you my bed. - No, I do not want. The buses, the light... - What? Yes, buses pass... And for your light, I put a towel. Nonsense, I put her. You always forget her. We'll figure something out. - It won't happen. But no problem... I'll go to Tak. I was just glad you told me you were staying here. I'm sorry. Of course mom doesn't want me to come... What? Your mother doesn't want it? - No nothing. Aren't you of legal age? Why do you involve your mother? - Leave it! Are you of legal age or not?! - Relax. Why are you bothering me with your mother? - Forget it! You don't need to ask her. - I'll sleep at Tak's. I'm of age, I'm going to Tak. - Exactly! My mother has nothing to do with it. - Tell me so! You can sleep here if you want. If not, no. What are you doing with your mother! She poisoned my life for 20 years! I can not believe! It's already 11.20 am, I'm late again. - Excuse me! I packed for the weekend. Milk and pacifier. Don't forget the shaving cream. Are you listening to me? Yes. - Okay. Damn, I'm terribly late! Leo, I just got the little one. I catch the bus and go home. Call me. Bye. Do you want? Damn it! Shit! "Think About Every Day" All over the body. From head to toe. Exhale! Slowly. And again. Look. Look! The effect is stunning if you put a mirror. Like when I first saw Ellen. I immediately fell in love. Come on. Good night, Michelle. Here it is. - Ready. Are you going to be okay? - Yes. Shall I help you? - No need. Thanks. Thank you, Jean-Pierre. See you soon. Everything is flooded. The entire walls are soaked. There is no way it will dry out in the winter. I'm screwed for winter. What will I do with the child? We can't get you an apartment. - Why? That's your job, don't let him see it! It's very complicated, it takes months. You know what kind of people come here. You are not a priority. Please? - You are not in danger, Michelle. What are you talking about? - This is the situation. I will take the child and sleep with him outside in the cold! I'm not a priority?! Are you kidding? - We are aware of the situation. Are you talking to Ellen? - I can not! If she finds out, I won't see her again. You should tell her. You hurt. - This is my mother's closet. I took it apart myself. - Do you? Ellen, you don't even know how to hold a screwdriver. Come on. Where do I leave my luggage? - Here. Here?! Do you bring the allowance? Take it. Here's your allowance. Let's get the mattress up, come on. Is it that good? - Yes. Damn it. Its terrible. Come on. The TV is for disposal. And the big box? - We throw it away. Curse! Beware! Get in, let's go. "Kills 99.9 percent of bacteria." Will do. Better bleach. Removes odor. Something with bleach? - Yes. That's better. - Let me see. It's perfect. - Plus it's written in German. You know I have no right to serve the family. Have you forgotten that we are apart? Shit! Father! - What? Grandpa's girlfriend may be with security. I have a receipt. - Excuse me... 72.95 euros. - I'm going. I'll be right back. You haven't paid them. - How long have we been looking for you! Sir! - This is my mother. We're at the checkout. I do not understand. - What are you doing? Your mother has not paid for one item. - I paid for it. We shopped together but forgot some things and we asked her to wait. - Well, and? She has Alzheimer's. He is constantly confused. OK, but what do I do with it? - With what? Do you really wear these? It's vulgar. Should we ask the cashier? Isn't that vulgar? Don't show them to everyone! - Answer honestly! Go ahead, no problem. - Thank you. Are you coming, mom? You're crazy. - Good day. You will be a man, my boy. No tears on your heroic face. The sculpted body will reach fantastic heights, above which only a dream can soar. You will be a man. From femininity, we trace, we look, we gesture with a hand. I know this song. - Right? I've heard it on the radio. - They keep letting her go. You will be a man, my boy. It is beautiful. It's not rap. - I don't just listen to rap. There's rap and melody, everything. You will become my historical hero. This is for you! Real... ... you are a man! This is for you! - Nonsense! Why should it be for me? "Real man" - who else but you? Are you kidding? - You will be a man, my boy. How come? - The text is nice. Hear it, father! OK, but it doesn't apply to me. Admit it reminds me a lot of you. Come on, enough! - I don't pretend to be a man. You will raise your male power... - God! There is something true. -... against sensitivity... You look like a big man. Yes! - It's you! The leather jacket... The jacket has nothing to do with it. ... you will never cross your legs... You are exaggerating. - Shut up and listen! I like. - You will be a man, my boy. With masculine strength you will shine, with a mighty bearing you will conquer the world. Triumphant manhood will scorn the weak, your masculine glow will carry you high. Do you recognize yourself yet? Real... ... you are a man. Exactly! - You are a real man. Will you drive it? - Yes. Bye, "my boy". - Bye! Thanks! - You're welcome, Josian. I will close. Bye! - Bye! Damn, it doesn't work. - Wait. It doesn't work, don't let him see it! Come on, don't break it now! what floor are you on - On the sixth. And this good one! You know... That's exactly what happened to your father. The elevator was broken and he helped me with my purchases. I offered him coffee. That's how everything happened. The cheese. Is it sadder to die in winter, or just the opposite? Winter is certainly sad, the day is short, it is cold. You say to yourself: "If I'm going to leave, it better be now." Everything will be fine. Yes. Did you keep them? - Yes, I keep them. How long will you stay? Not too long, take it easy. February 18 To each his own I love you This is your boat. - Yes. It's been there for a while. I have to pass an exam, but I don't have time. Your father told me you were a mechanic. - Yes, on motorbikes. I work with cars. - Okay... Crankshafts, carburetors, mufflers... Yes, but it's different. The engines are 4-stroke, but they are automotive. Can you weld? - Of course I can. Is there a certificate? No, but I have experience. I make frames... It's not quite the same. You can take training. You will be at the top level. He will undergo training. You have to evolve. Training does not obligate you. That shouldn't stop you. Say something! My friend offers you a job. What does the certificate change? I have experience, I practice. Today that is not enough. The new norms must be followed. You can't do whatever you want. Training will develop you. I grow in practice. - You're getting on our nerves! We're sorry, Fernand. - For nothing! Thanks. Are you okay? Have you thought about what I asked you to do? Yes, I'm considering it. You're thinking... Have you done it? All addicts are the same. You promise and do nothing. Subutex or Methadone? What do you want? - Meth, in pills. How much? - Four blisters. Okay, 200. - 150. Come on! Be careful, there are cops. - Open them! Don't we trust each other? - Open the boxes! Take it. Disappear! Catch it! His mother! Fuck him! Hold the bastard! You bastard! Did we wake you up? No, I wasn't sleeping. - Come on. Come on. Come have a coffee. Take it. What is this? - What you asked me for. So fast? I love this song. My old man... There was only one Sunday in the week. The rest of the days he looked to win, as he can. My old man... In the summer we went to the sea. As you can see, we didn't live in misery... "Rarely do we see a person fail who has taken our path. Those who do not recover are unable or unwilling to follow this simple program. These are men and women who cannot be honest with themselves. It's not their fault. Apparently they were born that way." Is this your first time here? - Good day. Good day! - Welcome. We'll find you a chair. Michelle, will you bring? Thanks. We will wait. What is your name? - Lily. Hello Lilly. - Anyone else with alcohol problems, who is coming for the first time today? We just started. We read what our method consists of. I will give you the floor at the end if you wish to speak. "We are fighting alcohol - a powerful, confusing and cunning adversary. We can't do it alone. But one is the Almighty, our Lord God. It's time to find Him. We have asked for His protection and help, and we trust in Him." "Our recovery program includes the following stages... First - we admit that we are powerless before alcohol and that we have lost control of our lives. Second, we believe that a power higher than ourselves can reason with us." "Third - we entrust our will and life to God, as we understand Him." - Sorry, I'll come another time. Goodbye, Lily. We continue reading. Stay! We have the same problem. I do not care. - Five minutes left. You know what? You're killing yourself. You kill your child too. Do you know what alcohol does to the fetus? To know. - Do you? Do you want to give birth to a vegetable? - Stop it! That's exactly what will happen. At first I couldn't make it 24 hours. I would get up in the morning and say to myself: "Come on, boy, don't drink until 10 o'clock." At 10 o'clock I said to myself: "Last until noon." I had lunch with my son so I wouldn't screw myself up. Then again, every two hours, until the end of the day. It works, I assure you! Why can't you? He also succeeded. Get tight! In the beginning, none of us succeeded. Two fucking hours. So what? Two hours. For God's sake, Lily! You will succeed! You will succeed, try! Try it in two hours! Two by two until one day there were 24. I lasted 24 hours without drinking! That opened the way for me. I'm back here. I'm back here, you know? But I won't make it. I can not. On the contrary, you will succeed. - I'm all alone! You're not alone! We are here. We all have the same problem. Just try it! Try just two hours! I am down. Will you come down? - I can not. I'm recording a song with Takumi. Nothing, come down for a while. I can't, we're working on a project. I'll send you a link. - What? I'll send you a link so you can listen to it on your phone. What idiocy! - She's not an idiot. You just have to click on the link, and you will listen to the song directly. Don't you want to come down in five minutes? Don't leave me alone, please. Next time. Go see friends. Okay. See you soon! Did you pump two weeks ago? - Yes. There is a problem. - I can't change tires now. No need, use a spray. You spray and then pump. You're a big deal! That doesn't last long. I drove 3000 km with a screw in the rear tire. Yes, yes! Until it drops. - No, that's what the spray is for. You should not remove the screw. - OK... Here is the apartment. That door? - Yes. I upload everything. Come on. Michelle, the phone! Michelle! - What's wrong? Your phone is ringing! Are you deaf? Jean-Pierre, hold on. It's a deer. Hello, yes? Yes I am at work. To have work. What? You forgot the little one in the crib. I should have come. I am waiting for you. Is there a problem? I forgot the child. do you hold - Yes thank you. How are you? Well yes! You're very cute. He didn't tell me his name. Arno. - Arno? Hi Arno. Yes, honey, yes. What? Yes, we will ride. Did you see that? Here is Leo's song. Don't touch! I let her go. Mother's tears, father's lies of my childhood made the days bitter. In silence we hide while you fall. We kill each other with indifference. A fake smile on the face, some money in the wallet. To connect the two ends, you open the bottle at the end. Dad's drinking in the garage, I can't show my anger. I accept the blackmail, mom needs to pack her bags. I am a plant, chaff, rooted in hell. I polish my joker smile, break the silence, about the bitterness of childhood to tell. Take it. - Thanks. See you soon. - Bye. There you are, baby. You'll sleep well here. You will be at peace. Look! This is grandpa. You are wonderful. So... One, two. The lighter is there. - No, I'm 76. Damn it! Like this. Ready. Come on in. Blow them! Come on! Happy birthday, Claude! Who touched my things? Josian, is that you? - I never touch your things. Michelle? Yes, I looked at them. - Did you look? These are my memories with your mother. - Exactly, with my mother. She's not your mother anymore. He killed himself because of you. You ruin everything you touch. You cannot provide a home for your son. Enough! Shut up. - You are like a tumor! Yes, I am a tumor. And what are you?! Stop it! She killed herself because you bullied and beat us! Stop! - That's why he killed himself! What do you think you are?! - Enough! The murky ones got you! Everything will be fine. Hello I am. I wanted to know if you heard the song. Call me when you hear the message. I called you. Kisses, bye! Hello. - What do you want? Methadone or morphine? - One gram of meth? Two. - 15 euros. Okay. Come on. Hello? - Elen, it's me. Is the child with you? Are you mad? - Let me go, I'll explain. Leo told me everything. No, I didn't take anything. I swear to you! Let me in. - Michelle... If you love your son, get out of his life. Wait! Dial... Call. The subscriber does not answer. - Pick up, for God's sake! A call. - Pick up! Deer! Pick it up! Pick it up, dammit! I'll call the police. Select a name and press the "call" button. Michelle, open up! Michelle? God! Michelle? Michelle! Wake up! Where do you keep the coffee? My wife left because I beat her. I was unhappy and started drinking. For ten years now, the kids don't want to see me. But drinking won't change that. I already have a problem, and when I drink, it becomes two. The truth is, she was right to leave. Do me a favor. It forced me to look at myself. Yes, it is hard. To be alone, not to drink. But that's your reality, my friend. Either you drink and throw it all away, or you accept reality. And you move on. And now the abstinence medals. First, for 24 hours. Yes? Great. - Even a week. Well done! Come on in. Great. - Well done! We are done with the medals, we move on to the seventh custom... Yes, Michelle? And I did 24 hours. Okay. God, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to see the difference between them. Thank you all! - Thanks. It's not easy. Don't let him see it, Michelle. Next time, Michelle. Thanks! Bye, Michelle. Thanks. Shall I give you a ride? - Okay. It is hard. Nobody said it would be easy. You have to feel it. A while ago, while you were introducing yourself, I noticed that some of you were wearing rings and earrings, others have long hair. While working, all this is prohibited. It's dangerous. The ring can get caught and you lose a finger. If the earrings get stuck somewhere, you will say goodbye to part of the ear. And hair can catch fire. That's good, isn't it? - It's ideal. Hold the burner like this. - Straighten her up, fine. Exactly. Okay. I'll be back home for a while. Goodbye, Michelle. - Bye. Come on, come on... - How is it? How are you, Taku? - Okay. What do you want? - I wanted to tell you that... I'm going to welder training, I got a job in a repair shop. Great. - We're waiting for you upstairs. Father? - Yes? I'm afraid that you won't become what you were before. There is no. Look, it's perfect. - Not bad. Quite equal. It's like it's machine welded. I couldn't have done it better. How is the training going? It's great. Very good, I'm satisfied. So. Thanks. Good night! Let's congratulate him. Michelle, will you sing with me? Happy Birthday, Dad! Shall we play dad's music? Happy Birthday my love! Michelle? I need help! Michelle! Your mother is waiting for me. Should I put it there? - Yes. That is all. - Take it. Put it in the back. Watch your head. I give you the board. Does it pass? Yes. - I'll take a last look and go down. Okay. You have taken the elevator. Shall I help you with your purchases? - No, I'll be fine. Ellen, it's me. I want to leave a message for Arno. Hey cowboy, daddy's calling. I wanted to tell you that... At first I didn't really want to be with you. But if you want, I'm here now. Michelle, are you coming? - In a second. Want some rock? - Yes. Get the Eddie Mitchell tape. The Rock and Eddy Mitchell? - What else? Eddy Mitchell is the king of rock and roll. Listen now. Listen to the intro! I was listening to the DJ in the car that was driving me on the way to Memphis. Is this rock? - On the way to Memphis. Of course it's rock. Stop it! - Yes ofcourse. A stupid lullaby was playing on the radio. On the road to Memphis. Which road? - To Memphis. Don't you know where it is? - In Tennessee, the city of rock and roll. I come to you. You are waiting for me in a white dress. Come on, sing! - I don't know the text. It's easy. - Yes, "on the road to Memphis." Provincial love is like Sunday. ... Sunday. - Not like that, more seriously! The driver behind the wheel drinks a beer and looks at the time. On the road to Memphis. On the road to Memphis. In the seat next to him, some dog is looking at me as if it is going to eat me. On the road to Memphis. On the road to Memphis. You may have had backing vocals. Solo! It's good. - Attention. I'm coming to you, but not in a white Rolls Royce. And in a suit a little thin. Well yes! I have the right to keep quiet and smoke, with my wrists in handcuffs held tight. On the road to Memphis. On the road to Memphis. Once the cops win, I'll just pass you by. On the road to Memphis. subtitles by tHe Sailor
