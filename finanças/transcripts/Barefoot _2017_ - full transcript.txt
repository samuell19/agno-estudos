IN CO-PRODUCTION WITH PRESENT CHILDREN ACTORS DIRECTOR Must you run like a lunatic? Eda? What happened? You alright? No one’s mad at you. Come out of there. LISTENING TO FOREIGN BROADCASTS IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE Listen carefully! Magic flute. Betty’s going home. Healthy soldier. It’s rolling. They’re coded messages. For the parachutists. What do they mean? Only they know that. That’s why it’s in code. So the Germans can’t understand it. Don’t tell anyone that Dad listens to foreign broadcasts. Not even your friends. There is only one punishment for traitors! Hi! He’s not purebred. But a good dog anyway. What do you mean he’s not pure? I don’t know. He seems pretty clean. ’Bye then. - Have you seen our Ffffuh... - Ferda? - Yeah. - He’s here. Fffuh... Ferda... dah-dah-dah... Home! He’s coming, Mr Chrast. Eda, the ball! - Eda, throw it! - Come on. Eda. Out of the way, Eda! - Game! - Well done. Behind the line, Eda! Mine! Nice! Stay here, or you’re going home! I’ll tell everyone that you listen to the foreign broadcasts! Betraying your own father! Forgive me, Papa! I promise I won’t do it again! It’ll be your fault if your father’s arrested and executed. My dad won’t do the Heil Hitler salute. Neither will mine. Not even at work. There’s a new manager at the power station. A German. Look what’s arrived. You read it. Frantisek Soucek... Read this part... Va... vacate your ap... apart... apartment number seven. What’s that mean? We have to move. So, we’re not going to live at home anymore? Does everyone have to move? No. Just us. Quick! Look out of the window! - Who’s that? - The Gestapo. They’ve come for Chrast! Why did they arrest him? Someone snitched on him for listening to foreign radio. He wasn’t careful enough. Kept telling people what he’d heard. Ffferda, nnno... One of our own people turned him in? Yes. One of our own. It wasn’t me! I didn’t do it! Come. It’s not the end of the world, ma’am. People are always moving. It’s true, otherwise we’d be out of a job. Didn’t think I’d come back here until I retired. It’s your house. Where else could you go? We’ll make do. What will you do for money? My son’s a clever boy. He’ll be okay. There’s no water. The weather’s too dry. They could use a hand in the sugar factory. The boy should clean his shoes. But it’s just a seasonal job. I asked about work at the blacksmith’s. Watch out for the horses. They kick worse than electricity. - It’s not like playing with wires. - Stop it. Why don’t you go outside? Play with the boys. Bring me the laundry basket from the hall. Where’s that? Come, I’ll show you. City boy, this is what we call a hall. For us, it’s a passage. Well, here it’s a hall. - Mrs Havelkova! - What? Tell the city boy to show himself! They can be your new friends. Go on. You can’t hide in here forever. I’m not going. I don’t know anyone here. Well, this is your chance. City boy, sissy boy! Go and play soldiers. Or whatever it is boys play. What’s your name? Eda. Ehhhh-da! What’s that on your head? A cross cap. Is that what they wear in the city? Are you staying for the holidays or for good? For good. You try. Maybe they don’t have stones in the city. Know what that is? A mort-choory. It’s where they put the dead people. Go on! Not bad, huh?! Ota is our general. Shorty’s first lieutenant, and I’m the kernel. You mean colonel? That’s gross insubordination. But you’re new, so we’ll overlook it this time. Just remember your rank, private. You have no business lecturing officers. Fetch! Never talk to that man. Who is he? Wolf. You mean, the dog is a wolf? That dog is a dog. That man is Wolf. His name is Wolf? No, his name is Soucek, just like yours. But he’s not part of the family anymore. Don’t even look over there. Keep picking. Why do you call him Wolf? He tried to throttle your grandma. - And he’s related to us? - Your father’s brother. So he’s your son, Grandpa? He was. Your uncle needed money to build a house, but Grandma wouldn’t give him any. So he started shouting at her. Right here in the barn. Saying he’d kill her if she didn’t give him some. - Our grandma? - His own mother. Imagine that. He would have killed her if your dad and aunt hadn’t arrived. For a long time, she couldn’t speak. We thought she might never again. What are you doing, Grandma? There are maggots in the flour. Doesn’t it hurt your feet? You get used to it. This thing has a 50CC engine. A Jawa-Robot. But an engine without petrol is pretty useless. Private Soucek, take off your shoes! Or be a sissy city boy forever. As far as I remember, you have to slide your feet across the stalks. I did it! Morning. Morning. Well, city boy, are you afraid of horses? - No. - Come and give her a stroke then. What’s your name? Ginger. Right, Karel? Ginger... Eda! Let’s take a look at her hoof. Eda, come and help me! - I’m not afraid of the horse. - Hmmm. - Doesn’t it hurt her? - No. She doesn’t feel a thing. I just stroked a horse! So what? But can you play cards? We’re not allowed them in my house. Grandma says they’re the devil’s invention. That’s an old wives’ tale. Where’s Satik today? I don’t know. Cool! Keep playing! It’s out of tune. When we can get petrol again, I’ll drive over to my sister’s. It sounds great with her fiddle. He’s such an idiot. You’re such an idiot! - So, you’re on the Germans’ side now?! - No, I’m not! - Are you a Czech, or what? - I’m a Czech. Must be a really stupid one then. Well, tell us what you are? I’m a stupid Czech. Only a truly stupid Czech would march and sing along with the Germans. I wasn’t singing! I’m sure you were doing the hi-lee-hi-lo with them. I wasn’t. I just marched. It doesn’t matter. It’s still treason. I was ashamed to see you like that. - What does the first lieutenant think? - I was ashamed too. - Private Soucek? - Ashamed. I say we strip him of his rank and ban him. We won’t share our den with a traitor. I wasn’t singing! With the new school year, we welcome a new pupil. What’s your name, child? - Soucek. - First name? Eduard... so Eda. He had straight As. And that was in Prague. Some of you should follow his example... Skaloud. Wanna get ice cream, like we did last year? Eda! Eda! Eda! I live next door to you. Have you come to see Mrs Soucek? Yes. It’s quite far. - Good morning. - Morning. Goodness gracious. Where are you taking me, boy? We have to go through the cemetery. It won’t open all the way. To stop people coming in here with their bikes and carts. There’s the same gate to get out. Come on. Careful. - Give me your hand. - Thank you. You’ll feel a scratch. Eda! It doesn’t hurt, does it? Bad blood has to come out. Eda! Look how dark it is. Eda! There you are. The Farmer’s Magazine says you can let them out after ten days. - They’ll have made it their home by then. - Be careful. The Farmer’s Magazine had better be right. If these two fly away, they’ll have one less subscriber. Shoo. Shoo! Peter! Petra! Come back! Farmer’s Magazine? Fool’s magazine, more like. Peter! Petra! - What a relief! - Isn’t it?! It’s a beautiful birdhouse anyway. Not everyone could build that. I’ll show you! There you go! There... You’ve helped me so much. Money can’t buy that. Oh, it can. That’ll be forty crowns. They found their way back! They’ve made it home, Dad. - He’s a war hero. - You think? Because of a chicken? Vlastik’s family used to have a mill in the North. The Germans arrived in a tank, a Panzer, to get them to leave. A chicken ran and hid under the tank. Vlastik tried to get her out... But the driver set off anyway and squashed both his legs. - Exactly. The Germans did it! - Not in battle, you idiot. By accident. The driver even apologised to his parents. Oh, that must have helped. It’s still a war injury. You don’t get run over by many panzers in peacetime. I would say he is a war hero. I’d like to see you in his shoes. Hear that? Must be American bombers. God, it’s hot today. I’d say he’s a... victim of war. Yep. But how he’s handled it... that makes him a hero. Yes! The engines sound so close. Crikey! Eda! Come on, hurry! Move. Go, go! - It’s obvious who did this, isn’t it? - It is to me. Let’s get out of here before we get the blame. We have to expel him for life. Right! Til he dies. Isn’t that a bit extreme? By the time he’s fifty, our gang might not even exist. - I’m staying in our gang til I die. - Me too. - Don’t just stand there. Come here! - You think we don’t know who did it? - Who did what? - We banned you, so you burned the place down! - What do you mean? - You’re expelled from our gang forever! And when you’re old and grey and walk with a stick and you come begging us to take you back, we’ll just tell you to sod off! One day soon we’ll look out of this window and see the Russians – Cossacks watering their horses in our well. - The Americans might get here first. - I think we’ve got mice. - I keep hearing a rustling. - I don’t think so. The Russians will want to be first. Your uncle here fought against the Red Army in the Czech legions at the end of World War I. They had to defend an entire railway across Siberia. Look how far that is. Eight thousand kilometres. All the way to Vladivostok. Apparently they’ve seen rats by the church. This big! I’d faint. I still have my uniform. - Put it on, Uncle, please! - Not now... Do you know any Russian, Uncle? A few words. I remember how to say hello. - How do you say it? - Zdravstvuy. I also remember: Kak tebye nye stydno. - What does that mean? - “Shame on you!” Zdravstvuy. Kak tebye nye stydno. Do you know why I chose those colours? Because those are the ones Uncle stole from work? Well, that too, but... Red, blue, and white...? It’s like the flag. Yes. Those are the colours on our flag. We have patriotic bees. But we’ll keep it to ourselves. It’s important not to be afraid. It’s a common beginner’s mistake. The Farmer’s Magazine says that bees smell the fear in your sweat and that’s why they sting you. Is it safe? Yes. These suits you made work! We’re bee-proof. She looks so sad, poor thing... God knows what happened to Peter. Maybe he got lost. Maybe he found another dove. Don’t say that. You saw them together. They were obviously in love. You mustn’t be afraid! We’ll finish this later. Bastards must have got in through the leg. Two. At least. Just a beginner’s mistake. Ow! Three of them! Look how nice your father’s hair was when we got married. Where is that? Here, in the yard. Grandpa had a farm, but he had to sell half of it. Mrs Pazdirkova lives there now behind the brick wall. You can’t recognise it without the wall. What happened to the horses? Grandpa had to sell them too. Why? I wish we had horses. That’s a long story. Did you hear that? I hope it’s not mice. Who are these people? Your father’s brothers and sisters. There were nine of them. Imagine. And who’s that? That’s Wolf. Feed the rabbits, Eda! I’m scared of your bees. Well, that was fun. Doctor Baudys was there. And his nurse. I told him: “Get rid of the pain, but let’s keep the size as it is.” - That’s just like you. - Shame on you. Poor girl, all alone... See? Animals can feel as deeply as people. Please don’t sing that, Mum. Maybe a cat ate him?! Not our cat. There would be feathers everywhere. - Could have been a marten. - True. Did I see a fire here the other day? And it was the old wreaths at the morgue. Oh, that. I had to burn that heap of old wreaths to make space. We’re all damn lucky it was the gravedigger who burned our den. We hereby revoke your lifelong ban from our gang. Welcome back, kernel. I’m allowed back in the den? No. You were banned for marching with the Germans. You can’t take that back. You’re still banned from the den, but since we have no den anymore, it doesn’t matter. Don’t worry, a few decent funerals and we’ll get our den back. They’d have to be big ones. Not just a few bouquets and an itty bitty wreath. Mr Kostal? Mr Kostal! Hello. Hello! Hello. Hello. They’re asleep, aren’t they? Yes. They always take a nap around now. What did you want? Cucumbers. For a salad. Okay. Come on. I can’t. Don’t be scared. You don’t have to tell anyone. Keep it. Thank you. - Kostal has the best cucumbers. - How much were they? He didn’t have any change. He said I can pay him next time. Kostal’s just lucky he has good soil. Stand straight. We need to get the length right. We’ll get the poor boy arrested. He’ll be fine! Why would mice be in a chimney? - He’s shaking like a leaf. - No, he’s not! He’s fearless, isn’t he?! - There’s something in there! Glove! - Don’t let it bite you. It’s not a rat. It’s a bird! A crow! Not exactly. This bird used to be white. It’s our Peter! Get some water, quick! It’s Peter, you daft thing! Your husband! She doesn’t recognise him! SUGAR MILL Ah, dinner for your fathers! - Hello, Mr Melicharek. - Hello. Okay. Let me see what you have. Alright. Go ahead. These wheels transfer the piston movement to this belt. And the belt drives the entire sugar mill. Here. Take it from here. Eda! How are you doing? Hurry! - Got it? - Got it. Go. Show us what you got. Something... Something smells in here. He frisked me from top to bottom! An inch lower and he’d have found it. Melicharek? You don’t have to worry about him. He’s in on it. Why didn’t you tell me that!? Don’t stamp. You’ll ruin the sugar. The sugar is clean. There’s two pounds. Poor boy, he had an accident in his pants. The German army is retreating as you may know. But they’re not giving up. Not yet. We’re being told they’re withdrawing to prepared positions. They’ll defend those for a while and then retreat to new prepared positions. There are many dead and wounded. So our school is going to be a sanatorium. - And where are we going? - Yes. Where will we go? To the old school building. Will the hospital be here forever? Will it be forever? No, children. One day you’ll come back here. Soon, I hope. You’re asking for a hit! Why? You come from the big city, with that stupid hat, thinking you’re so cool. Something up, Skaloud? I’ll find you. Look at me. I can see it all over your face. - What’s on my face? - You’re asking for a hit. But I’m not. Try this. Good. Now add a fighter’s bump. - A bump? - Use your tongue. Like this. You’re getting there. These belong in the cellar. Hello. There. Here you go. You’re good horses. Are they yours? They belong to Bartos. From the farm. I’m just driving them for him. Our grandpa used to have horses. But he had to sell them. Did they tell you why? - Did they? - No. Okay, let’s move on. And Mr Wolf, is it true... What did you call me? Would you believe it? The Americans drop these. - Why? - To confuse German radars looking for planes. They spray this in the air. When the German radars spot it, they think they’re bombers. - That’s really clever. - They’re smart as foxes. Three packs of cigarette papers. Thank you. - You bumped into me. - I didn’t see you. You should watch where you’re going. You might walk into trouble. Leave me alone. What have I done to you? You just look like you’re asking for a hit. - Goodness! - Sorry! - Why are you running? - I have to. I can wait. Chicken! You’ll regret that! What do you think you’re doing! Get lost, you little blighter! What was that about? Nothing. We met in the square and raced each other here. And you won?! - Yes. - Come here. Chop it in half. There’s a knot in the wood and knots are hard. - Do you know what our name means? - “Knot”. Well then, don’t put our name to shame. You know what Vlastik told me? He said there are partisans in these woods. Keep quiet. We don’t want to attract any attention. They must be freezing. - What do they eat? - Keep your eyes peeled. - Are we stealing, Pa? - No! We’re giving the trees more light. More space. - But if the gamekeeper comes? - He might think we’re stealing, yes. - Someone’s coming! - Come here. - Where’s he going with that rucksack? - Who cares? He saw us stealing, I mean, giving the trees more light. How much has your dad made? Thirty kilos. I helped. - We’re beginners. - I can see. It’s waxy. - Soucek! - Here. Take the horses out! Mana! Give the boy a kilo of butter. You’re amazed at all the snow, Ginger, aren’t you? She’s amazed every year. Come here. Come here, you. We’ll be passing your house. Better hide. They need to go out once in a while, so their muscles don’t shorten over winter. Could we give them a ride? Please? He can’t get anywhere in this snow... Stay. Your turn. Spur them. Harder! That’s it! What were your horses called? The short ones are for upstairs. What were your horses called, Grandpa? Never mind. What were they like? The best. No one had horses like mine. Where are they now? Nowhere. Feel this. It’s horse’s mane. From your horses? Yes. I almost forgot! It’s beautiful. They saw you riding on that sledge with Wolf. Like nobility. Calm down. - It’s Christmas Eve. - Exactly! You think Father Christmas doesn’t know what you did? He sees everything! - Father Christmas, just look at him! - Don’t open the blackout curtain! - He understands now. - Did you call us? No, he was just shouting at Heaven. - Join us when you’ve had your presents. - If there are any! Father Christmas has been to us. He’ll come here, too. Not necessarily! He’d be mad to! Don’t say that about him! Look at your mother. Why don’t you choke her too?! Go on! Just you try it! That’s enough! Let’s eat. Imagine what I’d have to do if you did! Grandpa had no choice. He had to cut off his own son. And now you have to decide. Do you want to see that murderous beast in that wolf’s lair of his, or stay here with us where we give you shelter, hot soup... Which is getting cold! So? Where do you want to live? - Where? - Here. Home. - Enjoy your meal then. - Merry Christmas. Ah, more helpers! What did you get for Christmas? - A flute. - You must have been good. If you’re not going to help, go and sit over there. It was the gambling. He was obsessed. I begged him to stop. But he wouldn’t. It was like a sickness. Every night he would go to the pub and play. You didn’t know he’d gambled the horses away? How could I? No one could have known. Someone knew. If you mean Wolf, I suggest you leave him out of it. Last month the Allies’ escalated their attacks on enemy targets. Bombing continued day and night serving as an indication of their intent. It is also clearing and preparing a route... Leave the door slightly open. It’s your house. Your decision. I understand. It’ll take an hour. To set everything up and transmit it... - I know. - He’ll be gone before they spot him. Now, attention. Jirasek’s writings are acclaimed. To be, or not to be. Gothic is an old style. Sensor of sight and hearing. Europe on fire. A fly on the wall. A lion’s family. A hundred is not a thousand. Save time. Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six... Mana, get ready, we’re going! Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty! Grazing time! Hey, Goose-boy! - Are those new pants? - Yeah. Corduroy?! They’re cut from my dad’s. What are you looking at? Americans. At least a hundred of them. Where are they? Really high up. More than ten kilometres. To stay out of range. I see them! It’s a bomb! It landed in the river! Don’t go near it! It could still explode! It’s not a bomb. Just a fuel tank. They release them when they’re empty. Is it really a fuel tank? There must be twenty litres inside! Fuel for Vlastik’s wheelchair! Act cool. - Hey, boys. - Good afternoon. Did you see anything fall from the sky? - We did. - Know where it landed? - It’s hard to say. - Which direction was it? Somewhere over there, I think. I thought it was over there. See how hard it is to tell? I could have sworn it landed near here. What a waste. A few litres. For a bomber, that’s like a drop in the ocean. But for Vlastik, it’s a sea of petrol. Will it run on aircraft fuel? You bet. It’s a two-stroke engine so you just need to add oil. He’s counting on us. We can’t bail out now. - Why are you running? - Someone’s following me. - Are they now? - When I sped up, so did he! Walk around a bit. Back. Hear that? It’s the corduroy. It did that to me too. - I was so scared! - I bet you were. But no accidents in my pants this time! I suppose that’s progress. Anyway, bedtime! I can’t sleep. Don’t worry. It was just the corduroy. You don’t worry either, Dad. Alright. Come on. Here’s the socket. Here. Emil... has finally... arrived... on a ladies’... bicycle. Too much oil! That’s okay! It works! How is that possible? It’s aircraft fuel! Aircraft fuel... Bye! I’m going to my sister’s! Eda! Eda! Eda, wake up. What a pity... You must have been having a wonderful dream. - How did you know? - You were smiling from ear to ear. You young lads everywhere... You hear him? You can tell he’s in a good mood when he starts screeching like that. You young lads everywhere, never give your heart to her... A romp in the hay is all very well. But marriage is the way to hell. - Dear little friends... - Sit down. Today, half of the world remembers the fifty-fifth birthday of a man who changed the course of history. Adolf Hitler is above all a great reformer... Spring is already well under way. So it’s no wonder we’re disturbed by all the birds outside. They’re building new nests, starting families... Adolf Hitler... Our windows were double-glazed in our new school. But here... Can you hear that? ...the fate of three hundred million Europeans... A tit. Did you hear the saw-like sound? Europe will be neither Bolshevik... That’s incredible, children! ...nor capitalist. I just heard a swift. The leader and the German military will take care of that! Swifts, remember, whizz through the air. I think you’re the one asking for a hit, Skaloud! How was school today? Fine. But I think our head teacher’s gone mad. We were meant to listen to a broadcast about Hitler, but he kept talking over it. And what did he say? About whizzes swifting. Eda, I’m sure the principal knows what’s best for you. But don’t tell anyone. Bunny, can you still see me? Chickens. Shut it. I was thinking, Grandpa, there’s no need for this mess. We could put the chickens in the back yard. We wouldn’t have to walk in their droppings. This is the countryside, girl. You can’t change that. Someone should go and pick wheat. I see I can’t change anything here. You’re damn right! It’s not worth discussing serious things in this heat. We never discuss serious things. You listen to him like a little boy. We bought this house with my dowry when he went bankrupt. - So the decisions should be up to us now. - You can’t change an old man. - He was used to managing the farm. - Really well! Come on, Eda. Let’s go pick some wheat. We can have a dip in the pond. If you’d stop playing and start picking, we could go swimming. Do proper strokes! We should probably go. Why? We were here first. Hopefully he’ll leave soon. Mum? Mum? You’re not afraid of him? No. Mum? You’re crying. We have to go. There’s a storm coming. You’re not supposed to run in a storm! We should have left earlier. What was I thinking? Let’s hide! It’s Grandma. It’s Grandma! She must have been looking for us, poor thing. We ordered four wreaths. Not five. It says here: Mrs Anna Soucek, five wreaths. Really? I don’t understand. Our family, sister’s family, Lojzka... Let’s keep the fifth one, Daddy, so Grandma has lots of them. Come, you should see her. It’s your last chance. I already saw her on the road. - Just you come. - Leave him be. He’s too young for this. Look! He’s right at the back. His conscience has been gnawing at him. Murderer. The fifth wreath is from Wolf. - Go on then, show us. - Show you what? We said you could come to our den if you... show us your... you know. We’ve done our part, so... I will. Just not in this cold. In the summer, we can go swimming together or something. Now she knows all about our den. And she didn’t even show us anything. I can imagine them. But it would have been nice to see. What surprises me most is that this was Kernel’s idea and he’s an altar boy! It’s what you all wanted! I don’t actually mind that she’s postponed it til summer. Maybe she’ll have grown boobs by then. They grow quickly, don’t they? True. By then, they might even be bigger than Satik’s. Excuse me. My dad put the sign there so they wouldn’t trample around here. You know what I sing at school, when we sing “My Johnny is ploughing, there in the big field”? - No, what do you sing? - I sing... I sing your name instead of Johnny. Well, that’s a silly thing to do. They’re thirsty. He’s playing the good Samaritan again. When Hitler seized the borderlands in ’38, he gave out water to the Czech refugees then, too. Eda, go ask Mrs Pazdirkova for some yeast. So he can’t be all bad. Water doesn’t cost him anything. Mrs Pazdirkova! Mrs Pazdirkova! I’m looking for Mrs Pazdirkova. - What do you want, Eda? - Is that you? Who else would it be? I didn’t know you had hair... ...I mean such beautiful hair. It used to be black when I was young. I’d braid it every morning. This is your aunt Ludmila, this is your father and this is your uncle Karel. - You mean Wolf? - That’s right. I was your grandpa’s housemaid. I tended the cows and the children. What was he like as a boy? Clever, happy. But he attacked our grandma. Well, Karel was the eldest. And the eldest son inherits the farm. But his friends would joke the only thing he’d inherit were debts. They got him drunk, he stumbled home and lost his temper with your grandmother. He wanted her to tell him where the last of their money was, before that gambler lost it all. He was unhappy and upset. Do you understand? - I think so. - What did you need, anyway? Some yeast, please. Don’t get in their way, children. They’re in a hurry. So, finally, I’m going to let you have it. No, you’re going to have it! Stop that, boys! United we stand! We don’t take crap from bullies! Present, arms! Port, arms! Ready! Aim! Airplane! At ease! Come here. Let me show you something. You shoot, you wear the helmet. Let’s load. Teaching them to shoot? Lean it against your shoulder, aim so that you see the target here, and shoot. - That’s it. - Seven! - Well done! Next. And fire. Good. Are you scared? Good for you. Bullseye! Wow! You soldiers are welcome to come and practice any time. On behalf of our squadron, we thank you. You should never salute without a hat. It’s a regulation. There’s a truck with anti-aircraft cannons. We can have an armoured train. Don’t get involved in this. You’re no soldier. - I know. - The warehouse has no electricity. There are prisoners inside. Will you have a look? No problem here. Go home to your mothers, boys. No train coming. “Which bird just returned from wintering in Africa?” “Children...” “The whizzes, the bird, that swifts.” Nonsense. That makes no sense at all. They are called swifts because they swift. But they whizz! That’s weird. Put down your weapons! They might mistake us for Germans! Hello Ginger. Check their pockets for their identity papers. Search him so we know what to write on the grave. I can’t read this. Do you think it’s Greek? They brought three dead people to the cemetery, from the train station. - You don’t say? - Two of them are Greek or Yugoslav, and the third one... was Wolf. They’re coming! About, face! They’re coming! Close ranks, march! Children, get closer. Hello! Bandmaster, when I wave, alright? They’re coming! - Hello! - What? - I speak some Russian! Really? Hello! Hello! - Shame on you! - What? You made it yourself? Myself! Yes! Airplane! German!? - What an idiot I am! - That’s all right. That’s okay. Let me try! Give it to me! What magic is this? I’m confiscating this! What use is it in the Army? We need it here! Not in the Army. I’m going home. It’s all wrecked there, we’ll have to clean it. Let’s go! They can’t do this! This isn’t enemy territory. They have rules to follow. We’ll report them. Forget it. Take it as payment for the liberation. To the Red Army! We can’t just let this go. They don’t own the place. If we identify him, he’ll have him shot. Shot?! For a vacuum cleaner? Go! And look! He’s not here. So you’re going? I have to. And you should too. You know Father. He’s forbidden it. It’s okay for you, you’re not his blood relative. He’d never forgive us. He died for our country! I know that! You think I don’t?! Do I look like an idiot?! Your choice. I want to go too, Daddy. We place our brother Karel in the ground as his body returns to dust. Oh Lord, give him eternal peace. Let the eternal light shine for him. Are you going to come back for the holidays? That’s good because we’re going to miss you.
