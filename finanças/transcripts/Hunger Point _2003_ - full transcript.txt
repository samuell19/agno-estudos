In our family, fat assumed a meaning as deadly as cancer. You're too pretty to be heavy, frannie. Now's the time to do something about it before it's too late. Getting fat was worse than losing your job, worse than being jilted at the altar, worse than growing up in a trailer park with no shoes. You want the boys to like you, don't you? No. Oh, come on. We're a team. First one to lose 10 pounds gets a new bathing suit. Come on. Come on. [ Indistinct conversations ] Mom, where does all the fat go when we lose it? [ Chuckling ] Mom, where does it go? It goes on her. Frannie, frannie, don't eat the skin. Don't -- give it to me. Honey, I love the skin as much as you do, but do you see me eating it? It's fattening. Why can't I be on a diet? I need to be on a diet. Shelly, you need nothing of the sort. You've got the legs of a gazelle. But...here. You're dieting. Feel better? Eat your dinner. That I desperatelye wanted out of. In high school, food occupied my every waking thought. Breakfast... One piece of toast, no butter... 21 M&M's. You're a fat pig. You don't get to eat anything tomorrow. I hate you, you fat pig. College was a busy time. I found sex. Not good sex, but lots of it. Filled my plate and gave me a break from calorie counting. [ Telephone rings, click ] Hey, it's frannie. You know what to do. [ Beep ] [ Crying ] I didn't know it would hurt so bad. Shelly, I'm here. What hurt? Hold on. I'm sorry. I have to take this. It's my little sister. [ Sniffling ] What happened? Just prom night. I-I'm such a loser. Forget about it. Prom night's always a disaster. Thanks for nothing. Don't you remember mine, when I was dancing and my fake fingernails came off and stuck in his jacket, and he was wearing a white jacket? Oh, god! I didn't want to go to school the next day. So what happened? Shelly was miserable in high school, but she was thin, a combination I found hard to fathom. She came home from Cornell with straight a's, plans to apply to law school, looking gorgeous, but totally weird about food. God, Shelly. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Door locks ] [ Vomiting ] [ Coughing, toilet flushes ] Guess what? Mom had spent all her time worrying about the wrong daughter. Did you just make yourself throw up? It takes discipline to be thin. I thought I had my problems with food. Turned out they couldn't compare with my little sister, Shelly's. We're ready for you now. Her name is Marilyn, but mom secretly calls her "chubby." Shelly? Would you like to tell them? I asked you to come today to help you understand why Shelly decided to go into St. Mary's. Yes, well, of course we want to help Shelly in any way we can, but she has a fantastic internship in a law office, and she's preparing her application for Harvard law school. So I don't know if hospitalizing her is the best idea. That's not your decision, Marsha. Shelly's severely depressed. In order to deal with that depression, we must first stabilize her eating and her weight. If Shelly feels she needs to check into a hospital, then she should. She should be with people who love her. And is forcing US to go on diets and talking about it all the time and getting furious if we gain a pound, is that loving her? [ Chuckles ] I was very overweight as a child. My mother fed me too much because, well, for her, that was showing love. I tried to teach my girls that food's not a substitute for love. I did what I thought was best, and I won't apologize for it. I just want them to understand that I didn't mean this to happen. We know that, honey. That's why you should be home with US. That's not what I meant. Right now, we want to stop Shelly's weight loss. Then she can decide her next step. If you really want to help Shelly, you will support her decision. She's my child, and I want her home. She'll go into a mental hospital over my dead body. Bang, bang. You're dead. Shelly told me each floor houses different afflictions. Seemed to me, the higher you went, the more screwed up you were. Floor number one -- mild depression. Schizophrenia at the very top, which put Shelly somewhere in the middle. How do they get this way? Not all these girls have terrible mothers. Stop. Why? I know everyone blames me. Mom, please, sometimes I just say things. Mom. Don't touch me. Frannie's just happy to see you, darling. No, we won't touch you. You look good. [ Sighs ] Frannie, isn't this place the biggest joke? Don't -- don't say "I told you so," mom. Well, you know, if this place doesn't work out, we'll cross that bridge. "We'll just cross that bridge." Oh! You're the sister. This is Cynthia. Shelly didn't want you to come today. How old do you think she is? 15? 16? 32 -- Cynthia was with the ballet till she screwed up her brain on diet pills. Do they monitor you in here? People sneak laxatives, diet pills, caffeine pills. Some girl even drank detergent. She couldn't stop vomiting, but she lost a pound, so I guess she thought it was worth it. Would... You feel it was worth it? Why do you always ask questions that you think are so probing but are actually moronic? This is Bernadette. She's a bulimic. There's a lot of animosity between bulimics and anorexics. Bulimics think they don't get enough attention. Well, you know, it's not what you eat. It's what eats you. It's what eats you. [ Chuckles ] Go see if pia got it yet. Got what? Who's pia? Just a girl. M.Y.O.B. So, how's the therapy going? Mom, don't touch my stuff. Do you mind getting up? Mom! That stuff's not mine. I know, honey. I'm just trying to help out. Mom, why don't you take a walk so Shelly and I can talk? Fine, you girls talk. I'll get some air. You know, this place isn't really so bad. Why don't you move in, then? [ Sighs ] She's making me crazy. She just doesn't know what to do, Shelly. [ Crying ] I'm so ashamed. I mean, I-I had everything in place, my job at the law firm. I was learning so much, and I was getting my applications ready for law school. I've ruined my life. Do you know how long it's gonna take me to undo this? This is a beginning. This isn't the end. And who's life is perfect anyways? I lost my job, my apartment. Now I'm stuck with morticia and Gomez. [ Chuckles and sniffles ] Where's dad? Yeah, where is dad? [ Chuckles ] You know, they -- they weigh me all the time, but I never get to see the numbers. We get weighed backwards, and it makes me crazy not to know. Do you think I look grotesque? No. Of course not. You're so pretty. I just want to see you get better. Don't say that. I am not like the other girls here. No, I know you're not like them. [ Sighs ] Really, this place isn't at all what I thought it would be, thank god. Oh... Where are you going? Time for meds. She looks so horrible. I want to take her out of here. Mom, she's really sick. I hate hospitals. This place makes me so depressed. Makes you depressed? Think about how Shelly feels. Who knows how she feels? I don't know how she got so bad so fast. Why -- why are you talking about me?! I -- oh! I asked you not to talk about me! Why don't you both just go back to your lives and leave me alone?! Fine, we'll go. Mom, wait. You heard her. If you want to go, go! We don't want to go. We just don't want to see you so unhappy. I'm not unhappy. I -- I just -- I'm just s-sick of being talked about like i'm some c-case study. We're sorry we talked about you. Hey, let's go take a break, go up on the roof. Come with me. Listen, Johnny Brendan's nephew went to Harvard law. Maybe he can write you a recommendation. Hes a big muckymuck at IBM. Mom, "muckymuck" is not a word. Fine. Strike it from the record, counselor. [ Sighs ] We'll be right back. Good morning to you. Just when were you gonna tell me you were fired? I wasn't fired. I was laid off. Come on, lazybones. I've got a job for you. My little sister had checked into a mental hospital, and I was doing exactly what was expected of me -- nothing. Here. Put on my jacket. Look like you belong. Mom, you don't need me here to answer the phone. You're gonna laze around my house all day. You're gonna make something of yourself. He's here. Buzz me and then show him to my office, okay? [ Sighs, clears throat ] Hello. I'm Daniel Reynolds. I'm here to see Marsha about the new agent position. Thanks. Daniel, hi! Hi, Daniel! How are you? [ Indistinct conversation ] [ Door opens ] Frannie. Yes, Mr. Brendan. [ Marsha laughing ] I knew that giggle. It's a girl flirting with a boy she likes, but this is my mother. Ugh. Mmm! It's delicious! There's no end to your flirting. What's that supposed to mean? I can't believe this. The chicken marsala is 300 calories. The deli man, Daniel -- who will be your next prey? Daniel? Don't be ridiculous. He's married, and so am I. Right, like that matters. Ice cream? Frannie, your father and I have been married 27 years. I hope that means something to your marriage counselor. I found the card, mom. When were you gonna tell me? You're just like my sister -- nosy and critical. Are you gonna leave dad for Daniel? I think I have the right to know! Frannie, stop it. Just stop it. I'm not having an affair with Daniel. I'm sorry mom. Let's get some low-fat yogurt. [ Scoffs ] What the hell? Sorry. This place must cost a lot. [ Indistwho's paying for it? Shelly's insurance covers six months. We're hoping she's out by then. Oh, my god. What a great way to meet guys. Oh, what? It's not like they're gonna want any of the women in here. Hello. I'm Dr. Thompson. I wanted to talk to you before you saw Shelly today. Hi. Hi. You are Shelly's sister? Yeah. Are you her doctor now? No, I'm just a resident. Okay. There was an accident this morning. No, no, it wasn't Shelly, but she is upset about it. We moved the girl upstairs for observation. [ Pager beeps ] I have to tell you something. You have the most intriguing mouth. Maybe Abby was right. Are you okay? Are you okay? I wish I were dead. I wouldn't have to feel so ashamed of myself. Don't say things like that. You've got everything ahead of you. You guys don't even know me. Of course we know you. What are you doing? He actually said, "you have the most intriguing mouth." Or "incredible." Maybe he said "incredible mouth." Well... Dr. Thompson? Can I speak with you for a moment? There you go. Yeah. I saw Shelly. I-I don't know what to say to her sometimes. She's so mad at me. She's not mad at you. She's mad at herself. Shelly didn't tell me how pretty you are. And please, call me Bryan. Do you always flirt like this, Bryan? It's not very professional. Of course I don't. Why don't I believe you? [ Gasping ] Something's wrong. She just started crying so hard. It's like she's hyperventilating. [ Gasping ] What did you say to her? She was talking about a girl who took a bunch of pills and her heart stopped. Is she all right? Breathe slowly. That's it. She'll be okay. The girl was Bernadette. Your sister was close to her. It was her roommate! Why didn't you tell me? What do we do? Right now, let her rest and keep coming to visit as often as you can. Even though she says she doesn't want you here, she does. No, Shelly, wait a minute. That's not what I was saying. Frannie, I don't know what you mean. Get to the point. I'm saying maybe we can't count on mom and dad for so much. I stopped counting on them long ago. Why did you call me, frannie? I'm okay now. So what if I went berserko on you? You know something, shel? I'm proud of you. I think it takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing. I can't believe you said that. That's so nice. Yeah, it was nice. Well, you're my sister, the only one I got. I want US to be true friends, frannie, like real sisters are. Me too. Hi, where have you been? I've been trying to get ahold of you all day. Yeah, well, look, it doesn't matter. I just -- right. Frannie's suspicious, but what can I do? I mean, throw her out on the street? No, no, I don't think frannie's capable of taking care of herself. Yeah, well, at least Shelly has a plan for her life. Yeah, she's applying for Harvard law school. Isn't that great? What's that, dad? Oh, this? It's a new item -- sweatshirt. Like it? Yeah. Looks good. Want one? I don't think it's my thing, but I bet it'll sell well. I hope so. Nothing else is. Is everything okay, dad? Huh? Sure. Just a slow patch. So, dad, I'm gonna go see Shelly. Why don't you come with and I'll buy you lunch? No, thanks, honey. You go ahead. I'm gonna finish this up. [ Buzzer ] [ Door opens, closes ] Hi. Hey, you look great. What's going on? Oh, one of the lawyers I've been working for stopped by. He asked me to research a case. It's very important. They may even publish my brief. I know you're looking for that doctor. No, I'm not. Should you be working? I mean, is that a good idea? Frannie... [ Scoffs ] I heard you finished your Harvard application. Why are you pressuring me? I mean, you're just like mom. [ Sighs ] She's the one who wants me to go there. Remember that college luncheon that one time? She lied to those snotty women and told them that she went to Harvard. Shelly, sit down. You're making me nervous. Oh, I can't. I'm totally wired. Maybe it's my meds. "Question -- how much more weight are you going to lose? Answer -- I won't be happy until I reach zero." [ Footsteps pass ] [ Beep, dishwasher starts ] You're not dressed. Look, look, Johnny ordered you your own jacket. What makes you think Shelly finished her law-school application? [ Telephone rings ] Oh, it's your grandfather again. You can go to graduate school, too, honey, as soon as you figure out what it is you want to do. Hello? Hi, dad. How are you? I know, but you're almost completely blind now. It's time. Dave and I are checking them out now. Checking out what? Nursing homes. Get dressed. I see a pattern here. Everyone around you gets institutionalized. Dad, I'm late for work. I've gotta go. I'll call you from there, okay? Okay, bye. You know, you should be proud. Johnny doesn't order this jacket for just anybody. I'm not setting foot in your office again. I refuse to watch you fall all over Daniel Reynolds. You have the most incredible mouth. Come here. Frannie... Frannie, come on! You've got food up! Guess what, Paulie? I hear you. Hey, frannie, frannie... [ Chuckles ] [ Sniffles ] All right, all right. Calm down. But I waited in all weekend. I told you, her mother was sick. What was I supposed to do? You could have called me. Excuse me. Sorry. Would you mind paying your check? You're my last table. We're not finished. We'll leave when we're ready. You can stay as long as you want. It's just I can't go until you pay. I've said you'll be paid when we're ready to leave. Don't talk to me like that. I am a person. There. You're paid. He's a loser. Let his wife have him. Oh! [ Beep ] Mr. Hunter, this is Arlene Reynolds, Daniel's wife from Brendan real estate. I need to talk to you. It's important. My number is 555-7672. [ Click, beep ] 555-7672... [ Telephone rings ] Hello? Hi, is this Arlene? Yes. I'm calling for my father, David hunter. Oh, yes. Yes, is he there? He's not ready to talk to you yet with everything that's going on. I'm sorry. I don't understand. He doesn't know about it, and we don't want him to! So leave US alone! [ Beep ] What right do you have calling the wives of my business associates? She called here for dad. Mom, she knows. She was calling to ask him to print up some t-shirts for a fund-raiser. I'm keeping it from him. You should thank me. I am not having an affair with Daniel. Look, if you want to live under my roof, then I want you to show me some respect. You think I like living here? I feel like I'm 11 and you keep telling me how fat and stupid and smelly and lazy I am. I need your help. I do. Please. Please help this family. I thought I was. Yeah. I know you did I'm glad we had this talk. [ Door closes ] Frannie, I have to tell you something. You promise not to tell mom? I promise. I didn't apply to law school. I-I lied. That's okay. I can't even hold down a waitress job. I got fired from rascals. [ Chuckles ] The hunter sisters. Shelly! What happened to your arms? Oh, I cut myself. With what? A tape dispenser. Don't get hysterical. It's no big deal. It didn't even hurt. They're gonna put me on tubes. Shelly... I'm not supposed to know, but I overheard them talking. Are you okay? I'm not crazy, frannie. I just -- I just -- I just started to think about everything I have to do, and, well, my mind gets overwhelmed, and, um, well, I-I start to get numb, and I-I-I have to cut myself i-in order to feel something. And -- [ crying ] I don't exist. I'm just a big black hole getting sucked into myself. You have to talk to the doctor. It's no use. It's my brain. It's eating me alive. It may not seem like she's recovering, but she is. You'll notice a marked difference in a couple of days now that her medication has been adjusted. She's thinner than ever, she's cutting her arm with tape dispensers, but she's recovering. We should talk about you, how you're handling this. If you want to make an appointment -- [ beep ] [ Cellphone rings ] Hello? Dr. Thompson returning. Oh, Dr. Thompson. Bryan, it's frannie hunter. Thanks for calling back. Who? It's Shelly's sister. Shelly from the eating-disorders unit. How can I help you? I think she's worse than when she got here. Her therapist says she's getting better, but I'm telling you, she isn't. Frannie, don't worry. Sometimes, patients seem to get worse before they get better. She'll be back in med school in no time. Law school. And I'm the girl with the incredible mouth. You don't remember me. Never mind. [ Beep ] [ Clock chiming ] You all right, dad? I always thought these kind of things didn't happen to smart people like Shelly. I don't think anorexia has much to do with being smart. Oh, I know that, but... I mean, with all those brains, why can't she find a way out of it? She'll be all right. She's got big plans. You think so? Yeah. It was hard for me to understand Shelly. One minute, she was in big trouble. The next, she was inviting me out for lunch. You sure this is okay? Marilyn said the diner would be good for me. How much do you think she weighs? So what are you gonna be for Halloween? Anorexic. You? Unemployed. Good. We won't have to spend any money on costumes. [ Both laugh ] Thanks. So what do you talk about in therapy? I don't know. Our family, growing up with mom and dad. How they screwed US up? They have their own problems. I'm past blaming them. It'd be good if you were. Maybe you'd snap out of your depression. Who cares if I get depressed? Everyone does. Marilyn said she'd find someone you could see. I hate when you do this! You switch it all around on me! Do you think you could order something else? I can't eat alone. Order, um... A Turkey sandwich with Russian dressing and fries. Excuse me? I'll be right with you. [ Chuckling ] I know I'm kind of obsessive. There's more to it than food. I think that by not eating, it helps me control my thoughts. I'm trying to figure it out. That's great, shel. It really seems like you're getting on the right track. Where are the fries? Right here. Thanks. Put the dressing on. Yeah, I'm going to. Is it good? Would you like some? Put more dressing on. It's not enough dressing. Will you have a bite? I'm not hungry. Hey, grandpa. Hey, my beauty queen. Where are you? I'm right here. Oh, nice to see you, honey. Where's the little one? Shelly's out of town for a while. Oh? I'll get the Chinese ordered. Remember what I said -- no brown sauce! She'll get brown sauce. I love your mother, but I don't think she listens to me. That's okay. She doesn't listen to me either. I'm so glad you're here, grandpa. Oh, me too. I feel like the next step I take is most important, so with Marilyn's help and mom's, I've decided to become... A writer. Isn't that exciting? What about law school? How come mom knows about this and dad and I don't? We talk every day. I have this theory about depression I want to explore. Why'd you look at me? I was looking at everyone. No, when you said "depression," you gave me this look. Oh, frannie, stop it. Tell the rest, honey. I'm leaving the hospital in three weeks. Oh, that's terrific. We'll fix up your room. I'll put in a TV. Hey, you rate, girl. No one ever offered me a TV. Thanks, dad, but I've decided I want to move into my own apartment. You what? Her own place. Last week, she couldn't handle ordering a sandwich. My mom, her life would be chaos without me. Who sits with Shelly while she spouts her bull? Who sits with grandpa all day while she's at work? Who's keeping her little affair from dad? Sounds like you're jealous. Of what?! That Shelly will be on her own and you won't. Listen, I've gotta go to work. I'll call you this afternoon. Abby, wait! Nine months shoe sales, three weeks selling time shares, five months at pet-o-rama, formerly a waitress at rascals. Huh. Not exactly a soul-shattering résumé. You know what? We're less interested in what you've done than what you're going to do, and I like your honesty, Francine. You'd be surprised at the stuff people make up for their résumés. Please, call me frannie. "Francine" makes me feel like a spinster. I think it's a lovely name. It's my mother's. Is that a Harvard diploma? My mother went to Harvard. Did she? Well, frannie, I have other candidates to see, but I like you, and I've got a good feeling about this. Thank you. What are you doing here so early? Get this -- a big boo-ha at avalon advertising actually likes me, and this time tomorrow, I think I'm gonna have a job. Whoo! Shelly, you just squealed. Whoo! Is this on? [ Rock music plays ] Come on! Come here! Come on! All: ♪ I wanna wage a war against all fear ♪ ♪ I wanna steer not disappear ♪ ♪ won't ever get high, wanna live out loud ♪ ♪ stand proud, too wild ♪ ♪ I wanna set the groove and move to it ♪ ♪ just because you want me to ♪ ♪ well, they say I'm only hanging by a string ♪ ♪ but I'm just a... ♪ ♪ This is the only way I know how to live ♪ ♪ this is the only way... ♪ "Dear Francine, while it was a pleasure to meet you, I regret to inform you that the position has been filled." Shelly, look. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. Get in there, Cynthia. Smile, Shelly. [ Laughs ] I think she's made more friends here than I've made my entire life. Thank you. Oh, pia, is this from my friend ed? I may put that to music. Thank you. Bye. I'll miss you. Thank you! I'm gonna miss you! These pictures are gonna be good. Bye! Bye! Yeah, I was jealous. The thin one got the attention, and the chubby one carried her things. Bye. I feel like I'm escorting a conquistador or something. [ Chuckles ] Oh, here. You must be so proud of your sister. She would have made a great lawyer. She'll make a great writer, too. Are you older or younger than her? Younger. Five years younger. You're lucky to have such a great role model. So lucky. Oh, wait. That's Shelly's. Oh, I rescued this from the file box. Thanks. I need this. Frannie... It's over. I'm free! Whoo! I'm free! [ Laughs ] Ohh! Shelly? Shelly? Dinnertime. I'm just so happy both my girls are home, and I want to congratulate you, Shelly. We're all really, really proud of you. It's no big deal, mom. Let's just eat. No, it is. It's a big deal. And you look just beautiful. Doesn't she look pretty, David? That's disgusting. We all have to eat that, you know. Like you'll be. Shelly, I have a job for you. Now that you've figured out your life, maybe you can help your big sister figure out hers. She just got out of the hospital. I thought Shelly was wonder woman. Chicken's at 9:00, dad. Thank you. Oh... Come on, honey. Have a piece of your dad's special chicken. It's got a yummy sauce. No, thank you. You can even eat the skin. I said no. She's back at the scene of the crime. Stop trying to feed her, mom. Frannie, mind your own business. Marsha, leave frannie alone, and Shelly, too, for that matter. Oh... He woke up. I'm tired of you bullying the girls. Just -- she's my daughter, too. She's 23 years old. You're just figuring that out now? Forget it. Let's just finish dinner. He always does that. No. No. I won't forget it. How many times did you visit the hospital? Hmm? How many times did you even call her? Can you count? Can you, honey? Can you count the times your father visited you in the hospital? Um... I -- I don't want to be here. Don't you dare tell me what I'm doing wrong when you weren't even there. Who was taking care of your father when you were off doing god knows what? How dare you judge me? I can't -- I can't believe you said all that. Hello! I'm here! Hello! Look, I'm sorry about that wonder woman crack. I feel like the world's biggest ass. Yeah, sometimes, you really are. I'm trying to say I'm sorry. Can you please forgive me? I'm sorry, too. I wasn't thinking. [ Sighs ] Let's everybody settle down. Let's have some cake, hmm? [ Sighs ] Come on, Max. We'll take our dessert in front of the TV. Your father just drives me crazy. You understand. Don't you? Frannie... Honey... Knock, knock. Hey, shel, I just wanted to say I really am sorry about the wonder woman comment. Shel. Shelly? Shelly? Mom, dad! Hurry! It's Shelly! Shelly? Shelly! Come on! Shelly! Shel. Shel. Shelly? Shelly? Call 911. What's happening? David? Shelly. David? What's happening? Please, David? Make her breathe. Make her breathe, David. Please, make her breathe! Make her breathe, David! Make her breathe! Oh, my god! Make her breathe! She was getting better. I don't understand. [ Sighs ] Let's get a breath of fresh air. Frannie? No, I'll stay. Shelly, it's frannie. Look, I'm sorry about that wonder woman crack. I didn't mean it. I'm just jealous. You're smarter, you're braver. You can do anything. Let's face it, I'm the loser in the family. When you get out of here, we're gonna hang out all the time, really get to know each other. Please forgive me. Give me a sign. Please. I love you. [ Sobs ] We've managed to stabilize your daughter, but... The doctor said she wasn't going to come out of this. It wasn't the overdose. They pumped her stomach in time. But the anorexia had compromised her ability to recover. Her kidneys were failing, her heart was failing. There was significant brain damage. They wanted my parents to consider turning off the machines. In the end, they didn't have to. She died two days later. She never gave me a sign. After the funeral, I didn't want to talk to people. I didn't want them to tell me how sorry they were... [ Car door closes ] ...especially that snake Daniel Reynolds... My mother's boyfriend. So sorry. Man: She was a good kid. Come inside. [ Voice breaking ] I hate him. I hate him so much. I want to take a gun to his head. [ Indistinct conversations ] Thank you very much. I'm not very hungry. God, she has no shame. My sister was just buried, and she's back to flirting. What? I want to take care of you, Marsha. Johnny? Johnny Brendan? I love you, Marsha. I always thought families stuck together in tragedy. Not my family. Dad joined a bereavement group at church and went back to selling his premiums. Mom put grandpa in a retirement home, started seeing a therapist, and threw herself into selling real estate. I didn't know what to do with myself. I sat in Shelly's room a lot. Pia: Dear Shelly, here is the list of web sites you asked for. I put stars by the best ones. Yours pro-Ana, pia. [ Knock on door ] Frannie... Are you all right? You are such a hypocrite. Your daughters can't have an ounce of fat on them, and yet it's okay for you to have an affair with the biggest pig in new england? Can you explain that to me, mom? It's confusing. Well... Things are changing around here. I'm moving to my own apartment. No. Mom, I didn't mean what I said about Johnny, honestly. Are you and dad getting a divorce? No, this has nothing to do with Johnny or your father or you. I have to do this for myself. Honey... You can't go through this by yourself. Please call Marilyn and get the name of a therapist. Please. Please. Can I help you? Hi. You okay? You don't look so well. [ Knock on door ] They're calling for you, Abby. My mom left. She couldn't stand the sight of me any longer... Not that she ever talked to me -- how pretty and smart I am or how I'm going to Harvard. Obviously the wrong daughter died. That's the absolute worst thing you've ever said. And that's not how your mother feels. How do you know? We've been calling each other. We're worried about you. How dare you talk about me behind my back? I am a person. [ Knock on door ] Look, I have to get to this deposition. Wait right here. I'm gonna finish up as fast as I can. Don't leave, okay? [ Door opens ] [ Door opens ] I'm back. What are you doing? Oh, my god. That's so sick. Where did you get it? It was Shelly's. I guess she was proud to be anorexic. Oh, god. You can't come in here. It's all right. You go ahead. Is your monster still doing it with her boss? What? That's what Shelly used to call her. Your monster used to call every day. Shut up. Keisha? Can I ask you something? Who was Shelly's friend ed? [ Chuckles ] I want to know who he was. Should I? I don't care. E.d. -- Eating disorder. [ Sighs ] There are more of these web sites every day. They close them down, and more crop up. Where did this file come from? I went online, like Shelly did. Please sit down. I don't know why I'm h here. These web sites are horrible, evil things, and you're like, "oh, more crop up every day. Oh, dear." You're angry. I'm angry, too. But some people can't be treated, no matter how we try. 10% of anorexic girls die year after year. That's a terrible statistic. Well, why couldn't my sister have been one of the 90% who lived? I think you are responsible for what happened to Shelly! Yes. I do feel a certain amount of responsibility. I feel responsible, too. How so? Because why her? Shelly was such a beautiful, perfect little child. I was the little fatty who had to go to weight-loss places when I was 10 years old. Are you saying you wish you'd been the one with anorexia? No, that's not what I'm saying. I don't know what I'm saying. Shelly left you with a lot of gaps. This isn't about me. This was a waste of time. [ Door closes ] Dad? David: I left dinner in the microwave. Three minutes is plenty. I'll be home late. Dad. [ Sighs ] [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? Frannie, what are you doing? Nothing, right? Get over here. There's so many cute guys here. No, thanks. Come on, we can have some fun. Remember fun? You have fun. Don't let me stop you. Frannie, you're like my sister, but I can't help you when you're like this. You are not my sister! My sister is dead! [ Beep ] When Shelly died, I thought her food demons were gone. I was wrong. God, Shelly, I never realized how easy it is. [ Retching, coughing ] Stop it. Just stop it now. I don't want to lose you, too. [ Sniffles ] [ Sobbing ] So this is what you left your home of 27 years for. [ Chuckles ] Try to think of it like I do -- as a sanctuary. How about some sugar free jell-o? Mom, what did you and Shelly talk about? I'm not ready to talk about Shelly. What do you talk about with the shrink chubby sent you to? Uh, several issues. She's helping me get off my medications, for starters. How are you? Are you okay? You don't look okay. I can't sleep, mom. You should ask Marilyn to help you find someone to talk to. I don't want to talk to those people! I want to talk to you! You're my mother! What am I supposed to say? Tell me why Shelly died. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I -- I miss her, too. I have a sharp pain that never goes away. Sometimes I can't catch my breath, it hurts so much. I have to get to work. Are you and dad getting a divorce? We haven't decided. Are you coming? Max owes me $15 from this morning's card game. Now, tell me, Rudy -- how can he play cards when he can't even see them? I tell him what to play. Why do you think I lost? Oh, did you bring some brownies? Of course, and macaroons for Rudy. Oh, what a doll. I want you to meet my grandson Charlie. Is he as nice as you? Yeah, but not as good looking. [ Chuckles ] Here, grandpa. Thank you. [ Chuckles ] Mmm. Mmm. I decided to volunteer in the cafeteria at grandpa's retirement home. Good morning. Good morning. Everybody thought I was being so nice. But the truth is it's the only time I don't think about Shelly every minute. Good morning. Hello, dear. Hey, Roberta. You got the hang of that Walker now. I'll just set this here for you. Thanks, honey. [ Indistinct singing on television ] Um, do you know where Max is? Hello? What? I'm looking for my grandfather. Well, I guess he must be someplace else. Are you naturally rude or did you take lessons? Nice hairnet. Well, if you have no objection, I'm just gonna wait right here. I have no objection. Thank you. You shouldn't sit so close. It's bad for your eyes. So you're an ophthalmologist? You're a jerk. Hey, I'm sorry. I just had a very long day and I'm tired. [ Sighs ] Great. This is just what I need. I don't want to add to your very long day, but could you just tell Max that frannie stopped by? Why don't you wait for him? He's probably somewhere with my grandfather. Excuse me. Good morning. Sit down, honey. I've got breakfast all ready. I'm not hungry, dad. Here you go. Look, I know you're sad, but you gotta eat. We talked about this in group. You have to compartmentalize your grief and move on, remain among the living. [ Sighs ] There's a message for you on the answering machine. Sounds like it's a job. Woman: Hello, I'm Vicky tayborn. I got your number from Paulie at rascals. I'd like to talk to you about a job possibility -- forget it. It's just another waitress job. Here, why don't you put that... Charlie, look who's here. Wake up, Max. It's frannie. Yeah, we've met. What do you mean you met? We're introducing you. Now, you look, Charlie. Isn't she pretty? He's blind. You don't have to answer that. I miss the hairnet. You always look like such a ragamuffin. Look at you. We know he's not blind. Well, there's some goodies. I gotta go. Oh, you just got here. I've got a date. No, you don't. Your mother says you never go out. I don't tell her everything. I have a date with a handsome doctor. What doctor? You don't want a doctor. Charlie's a lawyer. I don't happen to like rude men who insult women. Oh, a feminist. Confused about your masculinity? I don't expect to be on top all of the time, but once in a while would be nice. Just listen to them, Max. They're perfect together! Calm down, poppy. It's too early to call the caterers. Yeah, try never. I gotta get going. I don't want to keep my date waiting. Bye. [ Chuckling ] [ Sighs ] So, uh, how about letting me take you out sometime? You've gotta be kidding me. You ever make waffles? You know how the first one's usually a mess and you throw it out, but the second one -- mmm. So maybe the other day was like the first waffle. You're weird, and today wasn't any better. Well, uh, maybe we could throw them both out and start fresh -- a third waffle, as it were. Bye. Auditioning for "Oklahoma!"? I want you to take my picture... And make it look like these. You're placing a personal ad? How's this sound? "David hunter is a middle-aged cowboy "with an achy breaky heart "looking for a pistol-packin' mama "who ain't afraid of the call of the wild "and two-steppin' to garth Brooks. Yee-haw." It's a gimmick. You gotta have a gimmick. [ Laughs ] Ready? Here. Come on. Give it a chance. You may like it. If I was a 10-year-old boy, I might like it. I'm only here to shut up those two old geezers we call our grandfathers. Hey, don't be mad at them. I asked them to play cupid. What for? Man: Everybody clear? Ahh! [ Laughs ] I'm gonna getcha! Whoa! [ Laughing ] Oh, I've already signed up, actually. Oh, yeah? Nice. Nice. Don't you want more? There's so much. No, thanks. I couldn't eat like this in college. I was a wrestler. To make weight, I ate nothing but applesauce and prune juice. I was a skeleton. Now I eat like a pig. What's wrong? I just don't like when people drone on and on about weight and diet and food. I wish it was a good thing to be fat. I wish we were all fat pigs. Well, then, have some more fried rice. I really gotta go. What's wrong? Nothing. Bye. Frannie, just -- just tell me what I did wrong. Please. Skeleton. You said "skeleton." My sister died of anorexia. Her last meal was a bottle of antidepressants and my mother's tranquilizers. They could've saved her, but she was a skeleton. Her heart gave out. My 23-year-old sister died of a heart attack. [ Voice breaking ] Oh, god. It's okay. I knew about your sister. My grandfather told me. I should've said something, but I guess I didn't know what to say. I'm sorry. It's been so hard. I thought I dealt with it. I've grieved, I've been depressed. What else is there to be? I started seeing a shrink, but nothing's happening. It doesn't happen right away, I don't think. But now she's in my head all the time. Charlie, I don't know if there's room for anybody else right now. Right now? Okay. I can wait. Just don't bail on me. What's wrong with you? I'm like the poster girl for the American psychiatric society. Get out while the getting's good. No. No? No. . Hi, I'm Vicki tayborn. Hi. Sit down. Do you want some lunch? I should've called you. I'm just really not interested in waitressing right now. Thank you, though. On the phone, you said a job. You don't remember me, do you? You look kind of familiar. I was sitting at the corner table with my very married boyfriend, and you backhanded a glass of red wine right into his lap. Oh, god. He's not gonna sue me or something, is he? Five years I was with that horse's ass, if you can believe it. Broke it off that night, cold Turkey. I haven't seen him since. Well, I think it's for the best. Well, I think so, too. [ Both chuckle ] [ Sighs ] How's everything over here in sanctuary land? [ Sighs ] I'm sorry you don't like my apartment. Mom, I didn't say that. You're the one who called it your sanctuary. It was the way you said it. If you like it, it's fine. I'm sorry. You're always so critical of me. I'm critical of you? Our entire childhood, we had to be perfect -- in other words, thin. I was just afraid if you didn't watch yourselves, you'd end up fat and miserable. Now you're not fat, and you're still miserable. Yeah. Like mother, like daughter. I'm sorry. Me too. I'm sorry, too. So, what about this woman? You gonna take the job? What do I know about restaurant marketing? At first I thought she meant buying the groceries. They own nine restaurants like rascals, and they're trying to get more business. They're going after the youth market. Well, you're young. Yeah, but I don't know anything. So you'll learn. And you're smart. And people like you. Johnny Brendan thinks you're very clever. Oh, frannie. It really wasn't an affair. He was someone to talk to. He made me feel important. It was only a couple of times, for god's sake. Oh, that's all right, then. You'll never let me off the hook, will you? Why should I? You left my father, you moved out on US. And I killed Shelly. Go on, say it. [ Voice breaking ] Because I did. I killed Shelly. I didn't say that. I killed her! I don't think that. Nobody thinks that. Oh, god! Oh, promise me you won't let anything happen to you. Nothing's gonna happen to me. You promise. I promise. [ Laughs ] You want to know the truth about Johnny Brendan? He was awful. [ Both laugh ] That man should get some exercise. [ Laughing ] I'm putting you in charge of planning theme parties -- super bowl, Valentine's. What's the matter? No, I want to know. What's wrong? This whole thing is such a fluke. So what? So you've seen my résumé. It's pathetic. That's certainly true. Frannie, you changed my life for the better. I'm simply returning the favor. Now, did you spend a lot of money on that outfit? No. Actually, I borrowed this from my girlfriend. Good. Return it. [ Laughs ] That's him. That's Charlie? Cute. Very cute. You look so familiar. Cape Cod. A brunch. Remember? Then we went back to your house and spent the entire day in bed. You were terrific. Oh. I, uh [chuckles] I'm sorry. I-I don't remember. [ Laughs ] We work in the same building. Don't look so worried. I was just kidding. And when I get nervous, I know I screw myself up by saying all the wrong things, but the thing is I like you, and I don't want to mess it up because I think you're the one. But I feel so insecure, I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it. What do you have to feel insecure about? Insecurity's my department. Don't you dare horn in. But I don't know if you like me. So, I met a guy. I know. Grandpa told me. When were you gonna tell me? I'm telling you now. He's nice. That's all I'm gonna get? For now. I'm taking it slow. So how's the job? Mom, it's not a job. This could be a career. I'm gonna look for an apartment. What's wrong? What do I do? I want to help you. Tell me. I couldn't help Shelly. I'm not Shelly. I know. [ Sighs ] You always loved your bread and butter when you were little. [ Sighs ] You know, it's all so... Fleeting. One day your little girl's a toddler, the next she's backing the car out of the driveway. And it's you, the mother, that has to adjust because she's just gonna keep on growing. You only hope your daughter will live a better life than you did. When Shelly died, she took all that away from me. I'd give anything to change places with her. But I have you... ...and that keeps me going. We can help each other through this, mom. She's a nice woman, Eleanor... But? I don't think I'm gonna be seeing her again. You know, she's too intense. She -- she wants to talk about marriage all the time. I'm not ready for that. Dad, can I make a suggestion? Why don't you call mom and take her out on a date? Oh, come on, frannie. No, I mean it. You think she'd like that? Yeah, I do. So, enough with the small talk. You said you had something to tell US. Well, we're waiting. Well, yeah, we do have something to tell you. Poppy, Max... Frannie and I -- [ Breathing heavily ] Oh, frannie. Hi, Roberta. Handsome young man, Rudy's grandson. What's wrong with him? Nothing. Then what are you doing over here? You're absolutely right. [ Sighs ] Excuse me, folks. Just a slight panic attack. Where were we, Charlie? Did you tell them? Well, Max, poppy... You know all the scheming you've been doing. Max: It worked! Rudy: Of course it worked! They're meant for each other. And you guys are the first to know. Well, Shelly, it's been a year now. Dad is emoting these days, which is scary, but I know it's for the best. Mom is mom, but she's trying. I've been working on getting them back together, but so far it's no go. I'm doing events planning for a company that runs restaurants. So far, so good. At least they haven't fired me. One thing I wish is that you could meet my guy Charlie and that he could meet you. Yeah, shel, I've got a guy. I'm trying real hard to get it together, and sometimes I even think I'm gonna make it. Mom, dad, I think I'm gonna say something to shel. Shelly, I think we wanted you to be everything we couldn't. It was unfair, but it's only because we believed in you. You said once you wish we could be friends, like real sisters. You are my real friend. You're my sister. I'll miss you every day for the rest of my life. You will be forever in my mind... And forever in my heart.
