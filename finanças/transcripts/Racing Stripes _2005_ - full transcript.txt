You got a jack there? We need help here! Hey, we got a flat tire in the back now. They got to get that unloaded. Slick, get over there. I don't need you working on the tarp. I got it, I got it. Now pull it down. Hook it at the bottom. Jake, just get out of the way. Come on. Hey, John, Sampson, get out of the truck. We need a hand down here. Hurry up! Come on. We got a flat tire down there. Hey... Let's go. We got to get down there. We got to move right now. I've had it! Hurry up! Hurry now! Yeah, we got to get it unloaded. Don't worry about it... Don't worry about that... Stay with her. Everything's off. Let's do it, let's do it. We'll haul them off as soon as the tire's on. Load them back on! Don't forget anything. Come on. Yeah. Yeah! Come on! Let's go. We got it. Got everything? We got it all... Oh. Huh? What the...? Hey. Hi, there. Hey. Hey, just calm down. It's all right, it's all right. There we go. All right, there you go. It's-It's all right. It's all right. There you go. All right. You weren't kidding. Can we keep him, Daddy? Can we, please? Hi. Shh. I don't know. It's... You know, he's probably got all kinds of special needs. We should, uh... We should probably call a zoo, and... No. No zoos. You know I don't like the idea of animals in cages. Honey, neither do I, but let's just see what we got here. Let's kind of think about this. All right, well, first thing's first. Let's get him some blankets and warm milk. Okay, don't get too carried away. What's that... What's in the basket? Hey, Tucker, can't you see that? Oh, what's to see? You've seen one funny-looking horse, you've seen them all. Oh, come on. Get out there and say hello. Get up, get up! Wake me up when he leaves. You know what? I'll do it myself. It's the weirdest-looking horse I've ever seen. Very strange. Oh, he's cute, Tucker. Come out here and meet our guest. I'm coming, I'm coming. I swear, Franny, the funnier-looking the animal, the more you want to keep it. Kept you, didn't I? Ha, ha, ha. Well subdivide me and Kentucky fry me. You know what, Tucker? You cut those bangs, you and him could be cousins. Eh, just thinking out loud, thinking out loud. Question time. What exactly are you? Yeah. I don't know. Okay, we can rule out genius. Hey! Don't make me chew open a can of Pony Whup. Save the sweet talk for later. Don't pay any attention to him. Listen, he's all whinny and no bite. I'm Franny, this is Reggie, and Mr. Sensitive here is Tucker. And that old goat there is an old goat. Uh-oh. It's the chief. Hmm? You used to be so nice. Yeah, I know, but I got over it. Why do you have to be such a horse's... Ass. Well, let's just get you dried off first, all right? He got real strong legs. He's quite a little athlete. Hey, buddy. Why don't you grab the milk and see if he'll come to you? Okay. Come here, boy. Come on. Come on. Come on. There you are. Come on, boy. Oh, oh, come on. Attaboy. Welcome to your new home, Stripes. Stripes? Well, Spot doesn't work, now, does it? You like that name, don't you? Stripes. Well, I'll take that as a yes. Good morning, Walsh Farm. Well, I know it's not glamorous, but it's a living. Keeps my head on my shoulders, which is more than I can say for some of my cousins. Simmer down there, Linus. Hey. Hey, hey, slow down. Boy, oh, boy. Kids these days... no control. Now, back in my day... Oh, here we go again with the ancient history lesson Enough. Oh. Now we're in for it. Wow! Oh, what is that? That is the only reason for a horse to live, kid. It's called a racetrack. Oh, there's more to life than running around in a circle. Well, maybe to you. It's like this. Humans race, horses race... there was even a chicken run... but there's never been a goat race ever, ever, ever. Get the picture, Franny? Could I race? It's-it's-it's complicated. It takes a lot of work to become a racehorse. What's a racehorse? What's a racehorse? They're the greatest. Once a year, there's a big race to see who's the best of the best. By the way, the horses that won every year were the ones that we trained. Why did you quit? Ix-nay on the other-may. Comprende? Just say what you mean, Franny. We haven't spoken Latin since the pigs left. Oh, all right. A few years ago, the little girl's mother had a horrible accident. Yeah. Her horse stumbled, and neither one of them could be saved. The chief couldn't bear to train another day after that. And neither did we. Hey, look. They're ready to go. How come none of them have stripes? You take this one. Thanks. Uh, uh, just unlucky, I guess. Wow! Look at 'em! Look at 'em run! Watch me! I'm a racehorse! Well, would you look at him. He loves to run; It's in his heart. Yeah, but that's not enough. You could train him, then it would be enough. Let me tell you something. The legs are too short, the head's too big. He's got about as much chance to race as me. Besides, I have got better things to do. Oh, go fix your hair. I heard that. Watch me! I'm in the big race! Whoo-hoo! Excuse me. Racehorse coming through. Whoa, look at that! Come on! Dude, I'm right with you. Cool! Nice Mohawk. That's funny. Mohawk! What's a Mohawk? Shut up, you idiot. You guys train to race? Yeah. You want a taste? Ready, set, go! Catch me if you can! Hey! I wasn't ready. Come on, you slowpoke. Yeah! Yee-haw! I'm not even in second gear yet! Yeah, he's not even in second gear yet! Whoa, Sir Trenton, whoa! Last one to the fence is a donkey! Ooh, it's your dad! Great. Son! Stay away from that fence. Come on, Dad, we were just having some fun. Fun is overrated. If you're going to be a champion, I suggest you start acting like one. Oh, boy, your dad scares me, dude. Not me. Pride! Ruffshodd! Coming, Father. Yeah, um, coming, Mr. Sir Trenton... sir. I don't understand. Why won't he let them play with me? You're just different. And for some horses, different is scary. Come on. He's never late. I'm all ready to go. Where is he? Ah, here he comes. Bring it on. Show me what you got. Here we go. Hoo! Aha. Hm. Whoa. Uh-oh! Better luck tomorrow! Aw, dang, I had him today! She's just not right today, Mr. Cooper. Yep. Better give her a break. Okay. You call that jumping? Looked like she was having a seizure. Sorry, Ms. Dalrymple. She seemed a bit shy on the high jumps, so I thought I'd take it easy on her. Oh, of course you did. But, you know, the thing is, uh... I don't pay you to take it easy. I pay you to train. You can only push a horse so hard. Cooper, Cooper, Cooper. Why must you be so tedious? Okay, here's the deal. Now, as long as I am signing your checks, you will push her as hard as I tell you to. Don't you have a board meeting at the track to get to? As a matter of fact, I do. Yo, yo, yo, Pride! Check out the new filly. What a mane. Wow, look at those flanks. Watch. She's gonna come straight for me. Do I have anything in my teeth? You always have something in your teeth, Ruffshodd. Oh. Hey, where's she going? Excuse me. Would you care to join me for a drink? A drink? Good call! Uh... no. Ouch! Talk to the tail, boys. Um, did you ever consider going around that tree instead of running through it? Yeah, well, usually it moves out of my way. Uh, I've never heard of a tree doing that. You don't know the trees around here. Are you new? Uh, just got here. I'm Sandy. I'm Stripes. You don't say? Hmm. Are you a racehorse? No, I'm... I'm a jumper. I've actually competed all around the world. Well, I'm a racehorse. I'm training to be in the big race. By racing the mailman? Well, the other horses don't want to race me. I'm just way too fast for them. He's not a racer. Not them again. They say his dad's a horse and his mom's a fence. Oh, real funny, guys. Uh, I've got to go. I'm sorry. I-I'll see you around, Stripes? Later. So, Stripey, how's it going? You still racing the mailman? Oh, the mailman wasn't racing him, he was running away from him. I'll race you anytime you want. Ooh... Well, unfortunately, I don't race nobodies. Yeah, he don't race nobodies. Figures. All talk and no action. Well, this is disappointing. Oh, it's my dad. Listen, you, I want you to stop bothering my son. And you can tell Tucker I said that. Trenton's Pride is a champion with a real future, And you, well... you have your place. Father, I... You and I will talk about this later. Mr. Sir Trenton, sir, we've been trying to get this guy to stop bothering us, but he just won't stop... Ruffshodd. Bothering us. Shut up, you idiot. Yes, Mr. Sir Trenton, sir. And may I say, your coat is very shiny. There's a place where we can settle this. No humans, no rules. Where and when? Welcome to the Blue Moon Races. Tonight's first contestant is ten and 0, and good to go. He is the baddest pony on the prairie. Give it up for... Trenton's Pride! Step right up if you're horse enough. Not me. No way. Who's feeling their oats? Nobody could beat him. No way. He's too tough. STRIPES: I'll take him on. Hey! Laugh it up. Just wait and see. Hey, Sandy. Hi, Stripes. Well, well, I'm surprised you showed up. You want to talk or race? That coat is simply dreadful. Well, it's slimming. Oh, you're gonna wish you stayed home. You're gonna wish I stayed home, too... after I kick your butt. Oh! Big words! And now... let's get ready to... r-r-r-race! Up to that heap, around it, and back to here. I am going to make you look so bad in front of your girlfriend. Come on, Pride! Send him home, Pride! You got guts, kid. Come on, Stripey, try and keep up, huh? See you, loser! Just giving you a head start. You're gonna need it. Come on, Pride. Is that all you got? Keep up, would you? I'm not even breaking a sweat yet. Good thing your daddy's not here to see this. Holy cow, what a kick! Thanks. At least you're gonna keep this interesting, huh? I told you guys he's fast. Slow down, kid, you're gonna blow the turn. Whoa! Stripes! Nice turn, Stripey! I tried to warn you. How's that branch taste? Nice, dummy! Eh, what can you say? Rookie mistake. Stripes, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What a loser! Oh, Stripes. Hey, Stripey! Did you really think that you could beat a trained professional? Hey, there, boy... What's up? Hmm? What's the matter? I feel like there's something you're not telling me. What, you sick or something? There you are. Now you're all gorgeous again. I can't have my best boy looking all gnarly, now, can I? Stay out of the mud. So you're gonna stick to the story you don't know where the mud came from? It didn't come from the Blue Moon Races? No. Just took a mud bath for my arthritis. Chan. Helmet. Take it easy. I'm gonna be late for work. Yeah, that's right. Boy, will you get a load of this dump? Even old MacDonald wouldn't want this farm. But it's perfect. Miles from the Jersey shore, not an ocean in sight, not even a birdbath. No one will look for a classy guy like the Goose here. Oh, oh, watch where you're going. That's my knees! So, that's how we land in the big city. If there's no parking space, you make one. Any of you mugs got a problem with that? Nice landing. Can we see you take off now? Hey, are you a small horse or some sort of an ass? 'Cause you look like an ass to me. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but you seem to be a little more surf than turf. Did you take a wrong turn? All right, because you look a little slow, I'll skip the salad and get right to the risotto. Let's just say I'm having a little disagreement with my family. We disagree on whether or not they should whack me. Name's Goose. Oh, a pelican named Goose. Well, my name's Duck. Duck? Duck. Duck?! Goose. Oh, you're funny. But there's only room for one wise guy on this farm. And by the way, you should know that Goose is a name that strikes fear into anyone on the East Coast. Hoo-hoo! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I didn't do it. It was the horse with the funny hair. And the goat's in on it, too. You're fine, pal, unless you're being chased by a backfiring tractor. Look, here's the whole spaghetti sauce. I'm a hit bird. And when Sammy the Gull needs a lesson taught, the Goose is the guy he calls. Only this last job, I had a little mishap. Instead of hitting Freddie the Flamingo like I was supposed to, I hit Sammy's capo, Johnny Storkanado. And now Sammy, Freddie, Johnny, they're all after me. Hey, buddy, you ever try shutting up? You ever try swimming in cement horseshoes? I've taken out punks bigger than you. Yeah? What'd you do, talk them to death? Hey, be careful, pony boy, or someday somebody's gonna wake up with your head in their bed. I should have guessed from the size of that pecker, you'd be a big mouth. Watch it, stumpy. I'd cut you off at the knees, but it looks like somebody's beat me to it. All right, knock it off, you two. Nobody has anything to prove here. Stop it. Proof? You want proof, huh? You see, Rusty the rotating rooster up there? Huh? Huh? He's about to get Goosed. Where is hunting season when you need it? Okay, adjust for the wind. Nice level flight. Come on, Goose, use the Force. Uh-oh. Well, you can't say that he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn door. Acid rain! Acid rain! I'm blind. It's too late for me. Save yourselves. I'm going to the light! I see a bucket of dead relatives. Extra crispy! Extra crispy! Hey, kiddo, that's the worst turn I've ever seen anybody make. Awful, terrible, Stinko. I have no idea what you're talking about. Hey, come on. The Blue Moon Races are the worst-kept secret of all time. I know. I almost had him. I should have beaten him easily. Wrong. You need more than raw talent... which you have... to beat a well-trained racehorse. It takes skill... real skill... and real discipline to become a racer. It's hard work. Nothing good ever comes easy. Uh-oh. And speaking of hard work... Oh, boy. See you later, kid. Good luck. Hey. Tractor's down, Stripes. It's time to earn your keep. Isn't it? Yeah. There you go. Easy. Take it easy. Good boy. There you go. Come on, now. Come on, Stripes. Just give it a little more... little more. It's gonna be over with that much quicker. Come on, now. Come on. Come on... Hey, sweetness, look at your big-time racehorse now. Yeah, big time. Check it out. Hey, Plowboy, you missed a spot. Why don't you guys go choke on an apple? Oh, come on, darling. Don't go getting your tail in a knot. Kid, talk to me. You look frustrated. What's the matter? What is it gonna take for me to get to the track so I can have another shot at Pride? I'm not gonna blow sunshine up your tail, kid. You're from the wrong side of the fence, right? Yeah. The only chance you've got is, is, is, uh... Forget it, forget it, forget it. No. What? What were you gonna say? You got to get someone to ride you so you can show them what you can do. A human? No, we're gonna strap that sea-brained Reggie to your back. Of course a human, so if you do get the chance to race, you'll be ready. And pulling that thing can only help, so put your back into it. Get to work. Yeah. I will make it to the track, Tucker. And when I do, I'm gonna beat Pride and win the big race. Whoa, big fella! That's the attitude. Well, like my mama used to say, "You can put your boots in the oven, but that won't make 'em biscuits." Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Good boy. Good boy. You did all right, huh? Yeah. Good boy. Hey, there's my best boy. Been working you hard, hasn't he? See you later. Hmm. All right... I need to find a way to get rid of you. That could be arranged. Huh? Who are you? Name's Goose. Hey, look, I'm always looking to do a favor for someone who's been in the joint. When did you get out? Out of where? The pokey, the do-right ranch, the I.M. Bar Inn. Come on, you can level with me. What are you talking about? Oh, you're good. Yes, you are. You are very good. So where'd you do your stretch, huh? Sing Sing, Alcatraz, the Bronx Zoo? Look, how can you help? All right, listen up, you give factory rejects. Professor Goose is gonna school yous in how to take out a motorcycle. Class is now in session. Will we be tested on this? Stuff it, McNugget. Rule number one: We never say nothing. Even when tortured, not a word gets out. Franny, watch this. Goose, look out. Freddie Flamingo's right behind you. Hey, Goose. All right. I'll talk, I'll talk. It was Vito. Vito Pelligrino from Pier Nine. What do you know? Goose, who is really a pelican, is really a stool pigeon, who is actually a chicken that ducks. That makes five birds in one. Count 'em. I'm no chicken. Mind you, I got nothing against chickens. I mean, some of my best friends are chickens. Fowl are... fine folks. All right, let's go. It's time. Now, you guys stay here. This ain't gonna be pretty. Oh, boy, now what do I do? All right, tough guy, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Gentlemen, don't let the feathers fool you. This dude's dangerous. He's a killing machine disguised as an idiot. Hey, you like that? Huh? Right in the seat. Okay. Lights out. Burning up the paint! Do you like that? Come on. Can you hear me? Oh, a spitter, huh? Oh, you want to dance? You want a piece of the Goose? Hey-yah, Hi-yah! Karate-chop-a! Hock-a-sock-a! Sock-a-face-a! Break-a-bones-a! You see? You call the Goose, and bada-bing... Bada-boom. This is Reggie Red Rooster with "The Farm Report." In sports news, Goose the Pelican dropped the motorcycle in the first round, then for good measure, taught the truck a lesson, as well. Move it along. Nothing to see here. I'm gonna be late for work. Well, yeah, all right, you can take Old Blue. Oh, that's just great. Oh, come o... How long will it take to put on the spare? Honey, that... that is the spare. What the...?! Can I take Stripes? What do you mean, ride him? Just for today. No. No. Come on. I have to get to work. Can I take him, please? Honey, no. Besides, I mean, I'd never be able to get a saddle on him. All right, so I got a saddle on him... big deal. It's not like he's gonna let you ride him. You don't know him like I do. Well... Even if he does let you, you know how I feel. Dad, I've been riding since I was five. That's not the point. Come on. I mean, it's almost like he wants to be ridden. Oh, honey, honey, come on. Just let me try. Come on, come on... Careful. Now we're talking. Talking to who? What you been talking about? You've been training Stripes, haven't you? Just nice and easy. Run, kid, run like the wind. Show 'em what you got. Will you shut up?! I'm the coach; You're the goat. Now, this is the way it's done. Run like the wind, kid! Show 'em what you got! See? That's coaching. Come on, boy, come on. Whoo! Come on, boy. Whoo! Yeah! Come on, come on, come on... Whoa. Good boy. Oh. We'd better get going back. Circus must be in town. Used to see spots, and now I'm seeing stripes. Go home, Shorty. Where'd that come from? Shouldn't you be on a carousel somewhere? This ain't the zoo. Go home. Go home, four left hooves. Haven't you learned your lesson? You don't fit in. Go back to your tribe. We don't want you. Nobody asked you here, freak. Yeah, no freaks allowed. I'll see you later, buddy. Be good. Those guys aren't so fast. I can take them. On a cloudy day When it's cold outside... Oh, Scuzz! How can you ruin a great song like that? Oh, come on, man. That song's already ruined. You need some good tunes like this... Can't touch this Music hits me so hard, makes me say "Oh, my Lord, thank You for giving me With a mind to rhyme and a do-da-de..." Those aren't even the words to that song. The words don't matter, man. You know "You can't touch this," and then the rest of it's gold. Okay, smart boy. Just go fly yourself into a fan. Now, come on. Let's go get some food. Just follow me. Waiter, uh... table for one, please. Hey, why don't you take a closer look? I'll tell Mom. Oh, Scuzz, I don't believe it. I got 20 million brothers and sisters, and Mom tells me that I gotta look out for you. Well, that's 'cause it's easy, dum-dum. Nothing bad ever happens to me. Scuzz, you know what? Bad is the only thing that happens to you. Hey, pull my wing. No. It's not like before. I promise, nothing will happen. Never, never fall for that. It's too easy. Who does that thing belong to? He's mine, Ms. Dalrymple. I had no other way of getting here. I'll go put him in the stables. Yes, and from now on, you will leave him at that petting zoo you and your father so laughably call a farm. This is a racetrack, dear, not the Serengeti. Here come the hot stepper... burning up I'm the lyrical dancer... burning up Excuse me, Mr. Officer... burning up... You don't know the words to that, either. Yeah? Well, I can make up a rap song about anything. Yo, horses of courses We flies like to bite your booty Then we eat your fresh, hot doo... Hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa, hey, what's that? What? Huh? Well, that's obvious. It's-it's the racetrack referee. Buzz, check this out. Hey, pal, why the long face? Thank you! "Why the long face?" Still got it. Look, wh-what are you doing? Look, you're a horse. You all have long faces. Get it? It's a joke. I've heard all the jokes. The other racehorses have been making fun of me ever since I was born. All I know is that I'm different. Hey, kid, you think you've had it rough? You try starting out life as a maggot. Nobody wants to pet a little maggot... nobody. Scuzz, Scuzz, Scuzz, come on, now. Easy. Seriously, kid, what's with the stripes? Are you making some kind of statement or what? Yeah. You know, I saw you, and I was about to say to my brother, Buzz, "I never seen a black horse with white stripes before, you know?" You dimwit! He is obviously a white horse with black stripes. Now, anybody could see that. Hmm? Guys, look out. Are we dead? Are we dead? Well, if we are... Buzz, we're in heaven. Whoo-hoo. Bon appetito. Ugh! Here comes your Open winner, Ms. D. Yes, well, he'd better be, Mr. Cooper. Anything less than a victory, and you'll be back to shoveling manure. See you, Woodzie. Night, Ken. What are you doing, boy? We shouldn't be out here. I know, boy. I feel it, too. When I was little... my mama used to bring me out here at around this time. Put me on the saddle behind her, take me once around the track. It was like magic. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Come on, boy. Come on. Whoo! Yeah, come on! Let's go, boy! Whoa, boy. Easy, boy. Good boy. That a boy. Easy does it. Good boy. Channing. Well, hold on a second. Woodzie. You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? Mum's the word. Well, who's your friend? Some turn of foot. This is Stripes. He's quick, huh? I'll say. Like to get a watch on him for real. Dad doesn't want me to run, let alone race. Well, that's a crime. You move just like your mom. God rest her soul. And not even a proper saddle. Look, a trainer friend of mine is working some horses in a time trial tomorrow. Why don't you come out early and join in? Yeah, you... just think about it. Hey. Forget where the house is? Ms. Dalrymple made me stay late. I can't stand her. Don't give me excuses. And don't take it out on her. If anything, you should pity her. She sees a horse, she doesn't see beauty like we do, she just sees a piece of business. I don't see how you ever worked for her. She's such a pain in the butt. Well, 'cause I let most of it go in one ear and out the other. Worth it, I got a chance to work with some mighty fine horses. You could do it again, you know. Chan... Dad, everybody says you're still the best. We just need a few horses to get us started. Then we could put old Dalrymple out to pasture where she belongs. That's in the past, honey. I fixed the flat. You can take Blue to work tomorrow. But I want to ride Stripes. He was great, Dad. You should have seen him. That was a one-shot deal. You know how I feel. What about how I feel? The discussion's over. But Dad... I said no, Chan. You are so busy trying to keep me from hurting myself like Mom that you won't give me a chance to just try anything. Just because you've given up on your dreams, doesn't mean that I have to. Cha... He treats me like I'm still a little girl. Well, I'm not. I want to race. I'm gonna race. And no one can stop me. Doesn't anybody have a clock?! Easy, girl. Hey, it's Woodzie. What? No! Hey! I'm drowning! Get out of there, Scuzz. That's the man's "Expresso." I know. Hey... I'm "expressing" myself. You are the reason they invented fly swatters. Ms. Dalrymple, there are those that are saying Trenton's Pride is the only real contender in this year's Open. How do you feel about that? Well, dear, how do you feel about that? Ms. Dalrymple! How does Trenton's Pride compare with his legendary father? Well, I like to believe... What is that? James, where are you? And I... What-What... Where's... Excuse me. Excuse me. I can't believe we're being upstaged by a zebra. What is that dreadful child up to now? How can they allow this to happen? Put those down! Who do you think you are?! You don't know nothing about this! It's a bad joke! You're all right, boy. You're all right. Shh... Go, boy. Whoa, whoa, Stripes. Whoa-ho. Come on, come on, boy. Come on, Stripes. Come on. Hyah! Hyah! Come on, boy! Come on! Faster! Come on, boy! Whoo! Yeah! Attaboy! Faster, Stripes. Faster, come on. Who would've thought a zebra could have such a kick? Faster, faster, faster, boy! Hyah! Hyah! He's on the rail and moving fast. Whoa! Chan! Oh, my. You better make sure you get this, Mike. Chan... Chan... I'm all right, Dad... nothing's broken; It's no big deal. Just look in my eyes. Dad, it's nothing. Listen, listen. It's fine. This is exactly what I told you was going to happen. Your father's right, for once. He just got spooked, it's not his fault. He just needs some more training. Yes, right. Although I'm sure that more than half of the blame sits squarely on the shoulders of his rider. You're such a... Chan, Chan, Chan. Go get Stripes and meet me in the parking lot. You so obsessed with winning you're going to pick on a teenage girl? Really, Nolan, you expect me to dignify that? I'm just a Kentucky gal who loves watching thoroughbreds racing at the top of their game. Of course you are. Tell you what. As Chairman of the Turfway Board, I hereby extend an invitation to Mr. Walsh to enter his zebra in the Kentucky Open. All it takes is an entrance fee. Walsh! Mr. Walsh. Mr. Walsh... Mr. Walsh? Well, there goes the great Nolan Walsh, everyone. Corn farmer and zebra trainer. And you can print that. Hey, Clara, can they print that you ain't won the Kentucky Open since Nolan stopped training your horses for you? Mind your own business, track rat. You there. See what happens when you forget your place? A racetrack is no place for a zebra. What did you just call me? A zebra... which is what you are. You didn't really think you were a horse, did you? But I am a horse. A racehorse. You're nothing of the kind. You're lunch for a lion and that's about it. One thing's for sure, kid. You will never be a Racehorse. A zebra? I thought I was a racehorse. Why didn't anyone tell me? I just can't believe you deliberately disobeyed me. I can't believe you took her side. No, I didn't take her side. And don't change the subject. Mom would have let me ride... Don't bring your mother into this conversation. Just don't. Why not? At least she would have tried to understand. That's more than I can say for you. Don't get out of the truck. Channing, get back in the truck. Don't do it. Huh? Well, well, well. Look what the cat drug in. Oh! Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me! Whoa. Jersey flashback. Hey, we made it, man. Nice. That sure beats flying. We made it, but, uh... well, little skeeter here didn't. Oh, no. You know, that's why Mom always said... "Look both ways before crossing." Afternoon, Woodzie. What brings you out here? I got a hunch about your zebra. Look at this. I left it right where it was this morning. 23 seconds for a quarter mile? I know he didn't finish, but I got him between the quarter pole and the half mile pole: 23 flat. Your zebra. Look, that zebra really wants to race. I can see it. You just need to train him. Where would I do that? And even if I could, I mean... you got the $5,000 for the entrance fee? I don't. I do, and I won most of it betting on your horses. I know a good bet when I see it, and I can't bet him if he's not in the race. Come on, Nolan. No. That's final. Too poor to paint, too proud to whitewash. Whoa, whoa, he's not going to let Stripes race. That's not cool. Let's go talk to Tucker. Ta-dah! Guess who! Hey, Buzz and Scuzz. How you been, fellas? Hey, we sure miss you down at the track. Ah, those were some great years. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, listen... we got some bad news for Stripes. Let me guess: His parole officer's caught up with him. Don't let him take you alive, kid. Is he always like this? Worse. Much worse. Anyway, listen, kid. The chief isn't going to let you race. But don't worry about that; We'll cheer you up. Check this one out. Ebony and ivory Live together in perfect harmony Side by side on my piano... Get off me, you stupid flies. Get off. Man, "Ebony and Ivory" didn't work? Huh, that's a first. I told you we should have rapped. Stripes, you know, walking away isn't going to solve anything. Who cares? Leave me alone. We've got to get this kid into the race. Not a chance, the chief will never go for it. Of course he will. Just like somebody else I know, he just needs a little push. I'm going to bed. Channing. Yeah? Why don't you come on out here? Come on. This is going to be a hard one. I mean... probably the only thing to do, the obvious thing, is to get rid of the problem. What? Dad, no. It's not Stripes' fault. He's not the problem, it's my fault. Dad... you can't just get rid of him. I know him better than anyone ever could. I love him. What do you think the alternative is? I don't ride him. Ever, ever again. That's right, honey. Franny. Hey... Hey... How did you know? Whoa! If you build it, they will come. Well, it's show time, kid. You ready to start training? Why bother? I don't understand this. Isn't this what he wanted? This is exactly why I never had kids. Reggie. Yes? Get off my back. Hey, hotshot. Run into any trees lately? Oh, great; More jokes. I really want to be alone, Sandy. What's going on with you? That doesn't sound like the attitude of a racehorse. That's because I'm not a Racehorse. I'm not even a regular horse. I'm a... Zebra? I know that you're a zebra. I've traveled around the world, remember? Why didn't you say anything? Because I don't care that you're not a racehorse. You love to run and that's all that matters. Maybe to you, but it's not your problem, Sandy. You know, if you want to see the real problem, try looking down. Fine. Honey, I know it's been a long day, and after we're done with the gate, we need to start thinking about how he's going to last through the race. So we got to work on stamina more than speed, 'cause zebras burn a whole lot more adrenaline than horses do. They have heightened flight reflex. It comes from being hunted on the plains of Africa. That's right, you're not the only one who uses the Internet. Impressive, Dad. Let's get back to it. Let's give one more shot at it. All right, bring him in. That's it. Careful, Chan. Careful. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's all right. Walk him away from the gate. Walk him away from the gate. Walk him away from the gate, it's all right. Oh, the gate's always trouble. They should know that. He needs a break. He needs a break. So do I. I don't know why he's acting like this. Well, it's going to take him some time to get used to it, that's all. He'll be all right. I better go talk to the kid. Take it easy on him. Hey, kid, what's your problem? I'm not a racehorse. What does that mean? I don't belong in the gate. No, no, you're wrong, and I'll tell you why. Racing is for anyone, anyone with a fire in their heart. What do you know, you little nobody? You never raced. They're all the same. Tucker doesn't understand. He didn't even know that I was a zebra. He doesn't get it. What's he ever done? Let me tell you something. I've made a few clams on the ponies. This guy's all hair and no brains. That's just about enough out of you, young colt. And Goose: Bang! Come here. These people think they know everything. Every time you try to tell somebody something, they get an attitude. Hey, I didn't know the goat was packing. Come up here. I want you to take a look up there. You tell me what you see. I've seen them before. The chief, my girl and her mother. And that's it? No. Look closer. That's Sir Trenton. And who else? Tucker. That's right. Tucker. He trained Sir Trenton. He and the chief trained all the winners, and not one of them ever, ever thanked him. How come he never said anything? Because to him, actions speak louder than words. He believes in you, and now you're going to have to believe in him, too. I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. I'm the last one who should be name calling. Come on, look at me, kid. When you got shorter legs than a sheepdog, you get used to being made fun of. I can relate. It's just... Ah... I'm not really a racehorse. I'm a... I'm a zebra. So what? To me, you're just a horse with stripes who needs an attitude adjustment. Tucker, you don't really think I have what it takes, do you? Now, listen to me, kid. You're right. You don't have the strength or natural ability of one of the thoroughbreds. I knew it. But you have got more heart than all of them put together. But the gate... I freeze up. It keeps me from running. I don't what it is. I-I can't do it. Look, most horses are afraid of the gate at first. It's perfectly normal. But they get over it. You will, too. You just keep running, okay? And let the chief worry about the gate. He knows what he's doing. Attaboy! Yeah! Yeah, boy! You see... you see that? Good job, Chan! There it is. That's what I'm talking about. Good job, Chan! Walk him out! We might actually have a chance. Yeah, if we're lucky, maybe a 99-to-one. Well, there's just one thing left to work on... and that's the gate. Oh, no problem. You worked every kind of horse there is. Yeah, well, the problem is, he's not a horse. Relax, Nolan. If anyone can do it, you can. I'm counting on it. It's gonna sound like a carnival. You're not going to know which way to look. I want you to just look straight ahead. Just ignore all that noise. All that talk, all that yelling, all that jiggling. Come on, now. You got to let all this... just out of your mind. All that's got to fall away. That's right, that right, 'cause I want your world to be silent. I want you to hear nothing... just your own heartbeat. That's it. Easy does it. Come on, now. That's a good boy. Good boy. Good boy. That's a good boy. He's got the idea. Come on, now. Good job, Stripes. That's a good boy. Chan, duck your head. That's not so hard, it is? Slow down now. Good boy. Easy does it. Good boy. Just like that. There you go. Whoa, whoa. Good boy. You're doing good. You're doing good. That's right, boy. Attaboy. Ho, ho, ho. Easy does it. Good boy. You did it. Yeah, I guess I did, huh? Now what? Well, now you give it all you got. Attaboy! Let's show 'em what you got! They cannot be serious. This will not stand. I will not allow that beast to run in my competition. Please, Father, don't interfere. I can win it fair and square. Ha. That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

Oh, you weren't supposed to hear that. Oh, God, what is that? I got a million eyes and you got every one of them burning. Well, tomorrow's the big day, kid. Do you think I'm ready? Absolutely. Listen, you can run, there's no doubt about that. But remember, your legs are going to be burning up like fire when you're turning for home. And that's when you find out what you're really made of. You know what I used to tell all my racers? Don't look back, leave it all on the track. What does that mean? Kid, when the time is right, you'll know. Hello. Where you think you're going? You have a big day tomorrow. You can't go. I need to make things right with Sandy. Mmm. All right. I understand. But listen, a little advice from an old goat: Relationships are like racing. When you do it for love, you've already won. Go on, go on. Hey, Sandy. What? I was hoping you'd come by. - I'm sorry... - I'm sorry that I was mean. You go first. The things I said the other day... I just wanted to say I was wrong. Well, yeah. You just... you got me so mad because you weren't seeing it. Seeing what? How lucky you are. Me? Lucky? Yes. The grass is way greener on your side of the fence. Look at that those fancy training facilities. You've got everything a racehorse could ever dream of. Yeah, everything except real friends. Friends like you have. And a friend like I bet you are. Listen, Sandy... I know I don't look like a racehorse, but, uh... Stop. Stop. You know, I care more about what's on the inside and you have more on the inside than any of the horses over there, and, well, I also happen to think that what you have on the outside is the cutest thing on four hooves. And, just so you know, I'm already on your side. Well, well, well. What have we here? Beauty and the Beast. Oh, no. Sir Trenton. I'm afraid there's been a change of plans, zebra. You're about to get scratched from tomorrow's race card. Oh, no. There's so many. It's okay. We'll stay calm. Pretty picture, huh, boys? Don't do this, Sir Trenton. Please. Take her away. All right, boss. Let's go. Sandy! Stripes, I'm not going anywhere without you. It's all right, Sandy. Just go. We're out of here. Trust me, you don't want to see this. You better not hurt her. Oh, don't fret about her. As long as you don't race tomorrow, I wouldn't dream of harming her. You, on the other hand, need to be taught a lesson. Show him. Oh, that's just great. The race is in four hours. When he went out last night, he said he was gonna go find Sandy. And you, Miss Softie, you just let him go, didn't ya? Goose, time to earn your keep. I'm on it. Where are you, kid? Where are you? Looks like the work of a pro. Hey, kid... kid, come on, wake up. How many wings am I holding up? Is he okay? Goose, go get him some water. Ah, I knew I should have stayed with him last night. They have Sandy. Sir Trenton's gonna hurt her if I race. Those dirty rats. I say we get busy and show those bums what for. Pow! Oh, yeah, oh, yeah... no, you're right. You are right. Let us go and kick some horse flank. Come on, y'all. Let's move in with the SWAT team! Quiet! Thank you. Now, listen, to rescue Sandy, we all have to work together. Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in! Here's the plan... and I don't why I didn't think of this earlier... I could build a giant wooden chicken and hide inside. Then, under cover of night, I'll drop out and I'll... I'll... I'll... Or I could just stay home. Knock it off, Reggie. Now, listen up. Here's what we're gonna do. Listen, boy. I won this race, my daddy won it. His daddy won it. All the way back to General Trenton, who won the first Kentucky Open a hundred years ago. You get my point? I'll do my best, Dad. Yeah, well, good. You won't get away with this, Sir Trenton. Hush, now, little girl. You're interfering with my Mozart. I wonder if he was a thoroughbred. There's Sandy. Yeah, and there's Sir Trenton... all 1,500 pounds of him. We'll never get her out of there. Oh, yes, we will. We just need a diversion. I got your diversion right here. Out of my way. Goose, stick with the plan. Hey, moron, up here! Huh? Never side against the family. Uh-oh. Will you remind me again why we brought him? Hey, who killed the lights? Echo. How did you get in here? Say your prayers, Pelican. Your lights are about to go out for good. Can I get a little help here? Oh, great. There goes plan A. Say hello... To plan B. Horse's booty at 12:00. Follow me, Buzz. You're my Wingman. No way... you follow me. You are my Wingman. I am not your Wingman. You're my former Wingman. Whoa, dude, a little trim wouldn't kill you. What is that hideous racket? Get back here, you chicken. Come on, I'll fight you with one wing behind my back. Nobody is allowed in my stables. I'll shut you up for good. Scuzz, you always get us in trouble. Hey, Trenton, walk this way. Come on, Buzz, break it down. What in the...? This thing must be disco. Aw, come on, you can do it. You're Superfly, son. All right, partner, step back and watch me work. She told me to Walk this way... Tell me somethin' now. Talk this way... Sound like you mean it. Walk this way... Come on, now. Talk this way What is going on here? Tucker, get Sandy. You're the boss. ♪ Walk this way ♪ ♪ Talk this way... ♪ What...? Come on, Sandy. Tucker, you ol' rail rat, I might've known you'd be behind this. Let's go, quick. You and your animal freak show have gotten in my way for the last time. Those legs won't carry you far, Tucker. Hey, wait for us! Where are they? Come on. Stripes, over here! Sandy! Look out, he's coming! I'm getting too old for this. Listen, you was born too old for this. Let's go. You won't get away with this. Leave us alone, Sir Trenton. You and your foolish friends have accomplished nothing. The affections of a filly do not make you a racehorse. You know something, Sir Trenton? I don't want to be a racehorse. I'm a zebra, and I'm going to the big race. You fool. Come on, Tucker, let's go win ourselves a horse race. I like your attitude. You runts don't know what you're in for. Well, he's nowhere south of the barn. He's not by the creek either. What are we going to do? Well, we're going to keep looking. Going to start at the top of the hill. Well, let's go. We got a race to run. Stripes is missing. We don't know what happened. I don't know what you're talking about. He's looks okay to me. Chan, get him cleaned up and loaded right now. You got it, coach. It's the filly. It always is. Hey! Hey, she's from Philly. I didn't know she was from Philly. Oh, man, I love those Philly cheese steaks. Or any kind of cheese, really. Or, actually, any kind of food from anywhere... especially candy and poop. What were we talking about? I hate my life. Guys, I'm not going to let Tucker have all the fun. There is no way I'm missing this. Hey, hold on! Wait for me! Yee-haw! This chicken is flying the coop. Finally, some peace and quiet. Y'all go ahead. Bye-bye now. I'll just stay here and watch the palace for Shizzle. Woof. Hang on a second. Just, uh... I think your mom would've wanted you to have that. Dad... I don't know what to say. Well, you were right. You know, I've been... scared since Mom died. You know, too scared to train horses and... too scared to let you grow up. You forgive your old man? Daddy, you're not old. Maybe a little gray. All right, well... Just let's get a move on. Riders, up. There you go. Okay, come on. Stay away from the rail, now. Don't get boxed in. Ladies and gentlemen, would you all please stand and join in singing the national anthem. O say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hail At the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes... All right, kid, when you're in the gate, don't listen to the other racers. Let them do all the horsing around. You save your energy for when it counts. Right. But, Tucker, I do kind of feel sick to my stomach. Good. That means you're ready. ♪ ...And the home of the brave! ♪ This is Courtney Jones, KNN, coming to you live from Turfway Park, where horse racing history is about to made. Can a zebra... sentimental favorite, Stripes... beat Trenton's Pride? He is trained by the legendary Nolan Walsh, who came out of retirement specifically for this race. Stripes is ridden by the remarkable 16-year-old jockey Channing Walsh. What could go down as extraordinary in the history of horse racing is taking place at Turfway Park down in Kentucky. Only a few short weeks ago, no one ever heard of Stripes the racing zebra. Nolan. Clara. Beautiful day, huh? Well, it would be if you weren't working so hard to ruin my race day with that glorified donkey of yours. You're awfully chipper for someone who's about to lose. You want to make this more interesting? I mean... I'm listening. All right, I'll make you a deal: My zebra wins, I get your filly... the white jumper. And-And, your horse wins, I'll... I'll give you the Walsh farm. Nolan, well, my filly is worth twice as much as your piece of... land. I'll tell you what. You lose, and you come back to work for me. Lifetime contract... in writing. Deal. It'll be real nice to have you back, Nolan. All right, no speeches. You all know what to do. Go get 'em. Oh, there he is! Come on, Franny. You didn't think we were going to let you have all the glory to yourself, did you? Just like old times, Fran. Ladies and gentlemen, the starter's now called the roll. The horses are approaching the starting gate. Gonna ride you into the track, pony boy. They're all in. And away they go. Stripes! Stripes! Go! Come on, Stripes! You're out of your league, freak. Should have stuck to racing the mailman. Tell Tucker Ruffshodd's got him boxed in. Copy that, big beak. Ten-four. Roger Wilco. Ruffshodd's got him boxed in. Tell Stripes to hug the rail and make his move at the turn. Got it. Let's fly. Hey, Buzz. What?! Did you ever notice the irony when you said, "Let's fly"? What are you talking about? I'm just asking. 'Cause we are flies and all, you know? You ever examine life and think about that stuff? Would you shut up?! Hey, Tucker says to hug the rail and make your move at the turn. You're doing great, kid. You're doing great. How does the rail taste? You'll never see the finish line. Ruffshodd's putting the old Jersey squeeze on him. That's the dirtiest trick in the book. Oh, not for long. Time to take a bite out of crime. Oh, I hate horse meat. Here goes! Come out of the turn, and Ruffshodd has inexplicably tossed his rider. And Ruffshodd is out of the race. That's my boy. You've always been a pain in the butt. They're heading down the backstretch and Trenton's Pride is running a perfect race. He's moving like an absolute winner. Trenton's Pride right up there in third spot, but the sentimental choice, Stripes, is coming under pressure and starting to drop back along the inside. Had enough, boy? It was too much to ask of him. Yep. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh, boy. Maybe I was wrong. He might not have it. The kid... the kid is wiped out. Yeah, he's falling back fast. All right, okay, one last shot. You tell him if he believes he's not good enough, he should stop trying. It's okay. This is Superfly. We're proceeding to the target. Do you copy, Scuzz? Hey, I told you to use my code name... Luke Scuzzwalker. Hey, kid, listen. Coach says that if you're not good enough you should stop trying. It's okay. You tell Tucker I've got a message for him. Hey, Stripes said to tell you... Don't look back, leave it all on the track. Yes! That trick works every time. Whoa. Let's go. Stripes is starting to pick it up along the inside. Stripes is surging back into contention. Trenton's Pride in front, but here comes Stripes charging along the inside. And Stripes is picking them off one by one... he's coming up on Trenton's Pride. Come on, Stripes. Stripes! Come on, Stripes! Come on, Channing! Come on, Channing! Whoa! Ah! Let him run! Who let the zebras out? Ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh! Stripes and Trenton's Pride. Yes! Yes! Yes! No! Let him run! Come on, Channing! Come on! Move your butt! Come on! Way to go! Yeah! Yeah! That's my boy right there! By Trenton's Pride, and Stripes is the winner of the Kentucky Open, narrowly beating Trenton's Pride in a driving finish. I won. I can't believe it. I won. That's my best boy. Whoa. Come on, hurry up. We're going to the winner's circle. This is his moment, guys. Come on, he did it. Did you see him, Dad? Did you see him? He almost shot out from underneath me! Your mom would be so proud. And so am I. Hey, Stripey. Yeah? My father was wrong about you. You're a great racer. Thanks. So are you. We left it all on the track, didn't we? Yeah, yeah, I guess we did. I'll see you at the fence? Yeah, see you. Great job, Goose. You make a lousy gangster, but you're a stand-up pelican. Listen, you mug, I... I... Hey, that's the nicest thing a very short horse ever said to me. Well then, why don't you stick around here, Goose? We make a pretty good team. Now that's an offer I can't refuse. But first, there's something I got to take care of. I demand an inquiry! Do you hear me?! Channing? Channing, over here! That zebra was all over the field! Ms. Dalrymple, have you had anything... You listen to me. I want that zebra disqualified. Say hello to my little friend. And I insist that you pay attention to... To me. Will you excuse me? Oh, I know how you feel, honey. It happened to me. All I can tell you is rinse, lather and repeat. Rinse, lather and repeat. Stripes! Stripes, over here. Stripes! Where's he going? Come on, get back up there. You should be in the winner's circle. We both should be. I'd be nothing without you. Thanks, kid. You know, the roses make you look like Elvis. Very Elvis. Very Elvis '75. I'm so proud of you, Stripes. Thanks, Sandy. Coming through! Coming through! Big winner coming through! Oh, yeah, catch me, baby! Catch me! Get the good side. Hey, boy. Say cheese! Big smile!
