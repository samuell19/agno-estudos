island with all of us wow and say that again wow you amaze me father well miss when when you kicked around i mean when you've had as many experiences as i've had in this world nothing would be too amazing and i thought that the men of the cloth sort of plugged themselves up in monasteries and just red and red gee isn't it great i mean all those crocodiles and everything now listen girls even though he's a man he's also a priest i mean he isn't supposed to be a man i mean he isn't supposed to be uh interested in girls except in a very fatherly way confession is okay don't tell him everything okay well how about some papaya thank you oh um it's a very nice stream down below after you young ladies have finished and you'd like to go down there and cool off but remember stay close together and if you get lost around here we can be in real trouble did you hear that girls i just stay close together and from now on father osgood is the boss anything he says go well let's just sort of think of me as sort of a temporal advisor if i can comfort any of you in any way well feel free to come to me you are so sympathetic and kind father i hope i can always come to you when i need you well you can certainly count on my confidence and please do come to me whatever you desire thank you father i shall i'm ready for the water oh me too yes i i think we maybe all had better cool off a little bit now just remember stay close together oh oh oh my feet these waters are hot sister i could carry you oh thank you anyway father it's not very far is it no no no it's not much further let's move on there's the river watch your step watch these rocks are slippery easy desert hang on i mean sister give me your hand sister these rocks are slippery whoops i have you well last but not least oh this is like something i would saw in a tarzan movie well let's just hope he's not here gee i don't know about this silence plumbing but the bathtubs are great well we're okay for now girls if you want to sort of wash up and cool off go ahead i'll uh keep an eye on the trail okay girls coolest hallelujah my feet are killing me i wonder if i could confess a little something well you could start

kindly country priest a lot of laughs and the twins margarita strong silent title their sister jane what a double hero well there's josie well i'll just have to kind of break it to him gently that

hurry pick up all your things we've got to hide fast crying out loud come out i don't have any clothes on i don't give a what you don't have on come out well all right but turn around are you crazy get out josie josie come all of you get down get down just so this so father oh then i'm he's leaving do you think you could find a place where we were last night yeah i'm sure we can meet me there don't leave anything behind oh oh thank you father oh thank you father well thank you sister thank you sister better get those on hurry on up there oh me oh so oh me vodka me time he has been gone a long time huh so think something could have happened to him what are we gonna do without the father when you stop with my nerves your being nervous is making me nervous so don't make me nervous now if you'll all just relax i'm sure he'll be back all we have to do is wait wait hey father all's good father oh father all's good is everything all right up here yes we were beginning to be worried a little what about you well i'm all right i'm afraid i've got some bad news well there's a [ __ ] radio shack on the island well that louses up this little island we might as well drag out the raft again and look for another sandbox well maybe not as far as i could tell there are only two on the island maybe we could capture them with what you got honey you could capture a whole regiment no no i i think for the time being it's best if we just sort of stay out of their way don't don't let on that we're even here i don't think we have too much to worry about there are only two of them and frankly i think they're they're both as loony as bed bugs they're undoubtedly in constant radio contact with the mainland now if we try to get rid of them their superiors would figure something was wrong and come here to check on them see well we could just be in boku trouble what would happen then we could probably play musical chairs with a whole japanese army yeah that's that's about it so the best thing for now is to sort of uh play hide and seek with them which means we're gonna have to maintain a sentry system as a matter of fact it might be a good idea to sort of study their habits find out what they do during the day well if we're lucky we could sort of share this island without them even knowing it well um another thing we're gonna have to do is find a safe place to stay and i think i've done that so let's move easy here boy my feet hurt at this point i'd rather surrender than take another step well it's just a few more feet girls if you feel you can make it so let's go just stay together and keep quiet well there it is there wasn't a new home it's not exactly the waldorf astoria but as long as we're together we should try to make the best of it the last one in pull down the lid come girl follow father i think the father slipped his lid our suite is just ahead dear dear sister all right honey come on oh i think we are here oh how crazy i closed the lid father you don't have a thing to worry about well that's good oh i just love fresh cut flowers this is it snazzy uh honey that was me well this isn't exactly like home but we'll just have to call it that for the time being yeah you're quite right father just how long would you say the time being will be being well it's uh that's going to be kind of hard to say you know i think we can have a fire here tonight leaves will sort of filter the smoke i don't think we can be seen i'll uh go out and round up some wood perhaps one of you girls should come along and sort of stand watch the rest of you sisters can sort of clean up around here and make yourselves comfortable after you uh father would you mind because in case of snakes i'm just terrified snakes snakes do you think we really need firewood yes father we didn't need firewood definitely all right girls up up up sooner we clean this up up the sooner we can rest would you hang these in the closets oh we're gonna play house i'll vacuum you know i could be happy here for about two minutes ouch what what is it my hair is cut oh oh never fear my dear daddy is here oh i mean father will get a news for you not just just hold it hold it you really do have that card all right you know father this could really be fun of course if it was any other man but who you are but then the girls would really hate me who were they well of course after all we are all girls and no man except for you father but you don't really can't be a priest gloria yes father do you have to call me that well you are a priest maybe there's uh there's something i should tell you suppose i told you that you didn't have to let my being a priest bother you i don't understand well i mean is uh suppose we just let well they sort of accept the fact that you're a woman and i'm a man and just kind of let nature take its own course father why father how could you well no no not don't don't get excited what i mean is i'm not going on being a priest all my life please now look i never was a priest hey you're you're pretty much okay in my book father i know what it is i know what terrible desires are racing to your mind oh you do oh you are so right as i said you're a woman and i'm a man but i have to for both of us for you and for me think of your traditional i can't let you forsake your sacred world in the heat of passion no no father i know you will try to convince me give us any kind of an excuse i won't let you you won't eh no nothing to shave my faith in you i know it will be very difficult and trying father you you have no idea how trying and difficult it's going to be no no no just let's be calm try to think of mr sister or a cousin or something even thinking of you as a brother isn't going to help couldn't we at least hold hands the father father i must try and forget that you are a healthy big warm-blooded man the only man on this island have a banana firewood hmm we have got to observe our enemies habits go on and watch brother habits are the same any matches no matches not in here either not a match amongst us well we're gonna have to eat something besides fresh fruit i guess we have to figure on being here a while huh father maybe years we won't get back oh come on now girls it's not as bad as all that we don't think of a way out want her father oh sure sure it'll be no time at all you know i think i'll run down
