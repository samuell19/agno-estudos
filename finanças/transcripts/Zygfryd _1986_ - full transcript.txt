TOR FILM UNIT ZYGFRYD Written by Andrzej Domalik, based on a short story by Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz STARRING MUZYKA Giddy-up! SET DESIGN SOUND EDITING PRODUCTION MANAGER CINEMATOGRAPHY DIRECTED BY Praised be the Lord. Hello. You're here? During this downpour? Is something wrong? Nothing's wrong, Emil, I just sometimes feel like our lives are too long. How is the work progressing? Accordingly. Everything's going well. We need to add some color here. But the paint dries slowly. It's terribly humid. Plus this weather. So, it's going to be you? I don't get it. I'm asking who will do the bole before the gilding. You? God forbid, no! Kolecki, obviously. He's a true artist. It's lovely to be an artist. Have you ever wondered what “talent” is? Talent. Well, Emil? No. I admit I never have. Never had a reason. That's a cruel thing to say. And sad. - Very sad. - Why? You see, talent is the ability to experience in the extreme. Or rather, it's the ability to extremely express those experiences. No matter. They haven't done it yet, I telegraphed, but we still have to wait. What? I sent the check two weeks ago! Exactly. But my biggest problem are arches. The brick is crumbling. That is my essential problem. Your essential problem. You're a happy man, then. Giddy-up! Giddy-up! Giddy-up! Whoa! Move that horse, damn it! You were supposed to prepare the sawdust. How long do I have to wait?! Move or I'll crack the whip! Just you try. - Leave him be! - What the…? - What are you doing? - Ask others to haul sawdust. Stop butting in, ok? Go back to your horses, chief. Or they'll snap the ropes. - And? - And nothing. Don't start with me. You watch it, too. Don't take it personally, he woke up cranky. He's anxious about tonight. Zygfryd, wait. Come here. Come. Come. Close your eyes. Open them. See? Like in a fairy tale. Do you want me to enchant you? Not so fast, my prince. Show me. Nothing is free. Jesus, you have such strange eyes. So sad and evil. You devil! You have no heart. Show me. I've heard it a hundred times. Are you afraid? Quaking in my boots. - But… - Not here! Do you love me? You know I do. But say it. I love you. Faster. Hurry up. Waldo. The roses of autumn Sad and tea-colored The roses of autumn Like your lips, my love Trees dressed in purple Lend us their last shade Hey, Haganini! Haganini! Come here. The roses of autumn Sad and tea-colored The roses of autumn - Ever seen something so beautiful? - Many times. The roses of autumn You haven't seen shit. - I have. - Idiot. You've never seen anything more beautiful. Remember that! The roses of autumn Beautiful and tea-colored Trees dressed in purple Want some? Hey, play the one I like, will you? Faster, faster! More! Emil is here. Then bring tea. Master Stefan, I took the liberty… That's alright. You took the liberty, and what's done is done. No need to talk about it. The right word at the right moment. That's the secret of style. What are you working on? Goethe. Do you remember? Please, read the underlined section. “The naked body lay wrapped in a white sheet. Around it, in some distance, blocks of ice were arranged The servant uncovered the corpse and marveled at the divine beauty of its members. Before me was the perfect man in all of his splendor, and the rapture caused by this sight allowed me to forget for a moment that the immortal spirit has left this shell.” Eckermann! Naturally. Description of Goethe's body after death. Is it an apotheosis of life or death? Did you know that Lev Tolstoy sometimes hoped, or perhaps even believed, that nature would make an exception and grant him corporeal immortality? The whole world, the whole planet was in awe of him, so why couldn't nature break its laws just this once? Madness. Empirical evidence proves that others die. Emil, it is your duty to avoid platitudes, at least in my presence. The proclamation of banal aphorisms is unfair to both parties. You need some peace and quiet, but I can see that… Peace? Today, at dawn, I dreamed about myself. Some country cottage, candles, and black crepe over the mirror, obviously. I was watching over a child who was supposed to die. I was to make sure it died. You draw beautifully. I always say this with envy. Except that, at times, it seems too… Too cruel, you've mentioned. Old age comes. And ugliness. Until there's nothing left. There's no… life anymore. But you don't understand that yet. And you don't have to, not yet. I actually... came here to invite you to the circus. The circus? If forced, I'd prefer a brothel. I only have tickets to the circus. What would I do there? Clap at somersaulting monkeys? It's hard being a woman With a drunk for a husband No joy will she find in life Few things make one so disheartened No joy will she find in life Few things make one so disheartened So then upon one evening He got home completely drunk Started beating on his wife Downright deplorable skunk But here the wife finally Completely lost her mind She grabbed the husband's neck And choked him until he died She grabbed the husband's neck And choked him until he died Thus ended the sad life Of this never-do-gooder Who wanted to end his wife But was instead ended by her Justice has prevailed, that's comforting. But was instead ended by her Hey, Wróbel! It's going well! Our turn, Wilczur! If you're faint of heart, we advise you to close your eyes now! A daring duel with death: The Crown Trio! You will witness a rendez vous with death! Please maintain absolute silence! The Crown Trio! Are you alright? For God's sake, just what I needed! Congratulations. Unbelievable. Completely out of the blue! What is this? I had a feeling there was something there. - Don't you think it's… - I don't think, I know. This angel will make you famous. - Your moment of glory has come. - Me? Obviously not me. I've been recently discovering things that I don't need. Pardon me... We have to be careful. This is a priceless fresco. It's funny. - It really looks like… - Giotto! No. Giotto is more refined. I was thinking of… That acrobat from yesterday. Come back to me. Waldo. Waldo. Waldo. Bitch. Come here. Apologize. I'm sorry. Get out. Done! Alright, light it! Ok, put it out! Want to help me, kid? Hey! Don't sleep, or they'll rob you! So? Wanna help me out? Why me? Because I like you. What, you're scared? Sure I am. That's what I thought. Little boy got scared, but there's no helping that. Know who'll help me do the trick? What do you? Romeo! I thought you were braver! I'm an acrobat, not a target dummy. I was asking if you were a man! If you had balls! I don't. Hello, my lovely. Hello, boss. Jesus, a circus Madonna. Stay right there. There! Ladies and gentlemen! Bets are open! Will he survive or not? Everyone can win, Zygfryd can lose! Did you say your prayers? Yes. For you as well. God bless. Now close those bluebottle eyes. And don't move. Don't move, damn it! You want me to hurt you? Pardon me. Sorry to interrupt. May I? Hello, my name is Drawicz. Just a second. I'll kill you, motherfucker. I'm Waldo. And this is my wife, my good sir. Dancer and stunt rider. One of the best the circus has ever seen. You can believe me. Yes, I know. I saw it. And I don't regret it. I admired your marvelous show. What a great evening. Thank you very much. Hear that, kids? The gentlemen liked us! As you can see, our troupe is still incomplete. I'm preparing a new show, this tour is just… To get by, as they say. To make ends meet. And what business do you have with us, sir? I came here to see the backstage of circus life. Artists have always fascinated me. Especially as I dreamed of being an actor. But… That was a long time ago. Oh well. As you can see, it's a modest life and hard work. You win some, you lose some… day after day. Sometimes too cold, sometimes too hot. Cold and hungry, dirty and boring. Julian! Step up, Julian. This is our main star. His posture is quite modest. The good Lord skimped on that, but his soul is great. And unparalleled talent. Bravo. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm alright now. Once again, I apologize. I must bid you farewell. Good bye. I wish you all success. Zygfryd! Will you make it home? Of course, my beautiful lady. Come here. You'll walk the nice man all the way to his door. You won't say no. Let's go. What did he want? To look at artists. To gawk. At poverty, dirt, and rags. Men like him like to do that sometimes. Makes them feel better. I know his ilk. They make me sick. I'll do it myself. You can go. Stay. I don't mind you being here. I don't want to be alone. Maybe you're hungry? Tell me something about yourself. Like what? I've always been a circus man. - Can you read? - I can. Julian taught me. The manager? No. The dwarf. It's very beautiful, isn't it? Venice. You went there? I certainly did. It must be so fascinating. What? Traveling around the world. Moving from place to place. Oh, yes. But every journey must end, you always have to return. Why? If you have lots of money… I wouldn't have to. You're wrong. One day you'll understand, and it'll be a painful lesson. A friend of yours? Bring it closer, I can't see. This is Anton Chekhov, a writer. Did you know him? No, he's been dead for 30 years. But I'd gladly get to know him. - Have you read them all? - I have. All of them? I swear. You must know a lot. I don't know anything. Me neither. You must be joking. I used to think otherwise, but I've lost all certitude a long time ago. What about these books? Books, my dear boy, only outline life as it is. The rest you have to figure out by yourself. Look at me. I'm old, I barely care about what's going to happen. To me, to the world. You're only just beginning, but already have to start thinking about why you're alive, what your goals are. And pursue them, otherwise you'll die and no one will notice, not even you. That's hard. Very much so. Go now. You'll be late to your show. I've tired you out? Talking to an artist is always tiring. Will you come to our show again? I'll make an extra effort for you. I'll be thinking about you. Really. Alright. I'll give you something for your manager. Give the boy a bottle of cognac. Ring! There you go! And again! Zygfryd! - Will you go with me? - Where? To the bar, my ray of light. - Have you seen Maria? - Maria? Do you have a date? Leave me alone, you drunk. I'll give you an advice. Well? Stay away from Maria, she's ruined better men than you. She's a bad woman. Remember that. It would be a shame. Ok, off you go. You'll thank me yet, kid! - Have you seen Maria? - No. E. Manet. Manet. E. Manet. Please don't touch anything. They are very precious exhibits. I know. It's not a village market, you can't just grope things. How old are you? - Why? - Hey! And keep the window closed. Leave it. I'll do it. You'd probably end up breaking it. Take advantage of the master's largesse. Learn. It'll do you good. Maybe you'll even go to university, eh? Maybe I will. Look at him, putting on airs. Such a poet, wouldn't you know it. Are you done? Why? You're distracting me. - Listen here! - No, you listen! Scram! I wish to be alone. Alright, alright. Zygfryd! Zygfryd! Get ready, you guys! What was that, damn it? Don't ever do that to me again. Come. March out! Ladies and gentlemen! Good bye, good bye, we'll see you soon. Come tomorrow for new attractions and new surprises. Thank you. I'm looking for Zygfryd. Didn't go great today, people jeered. But it doesn't matter, I think I'm quitting. And going where? I'll figure something out. You want to quit the circus? Why not? And what are you going to do? They might be happy, but I'm not. I don't want to die in this dump. I have to start doing something else. We talked about it. I thought you understood. I'm trying to. You have to work. What do you think I'm doing? Doing the same thing every night. I meant perfecting the thing you're doing. You show people things beyond their reach, you enrich them. That's why you can't disregard your audience or disappoint them. It's important. Remember that. Alright, but what about me? It's also about you. People need you and your art, and you need them. You're an artist, and that's a dangerously loaded profession. Well, I'm here to tell you that it's not enough for me anymore. Anymore? For some time, actually. In that case let me tell you something. You can feel your wings growing, but don't get too cocky, wings are nothing special. You change your tune every day. Not at all. Come tomorrow, we'll talk. I don't think I will. You will. You're our most loyal audience. Yes, I do like coming here. - Strange. - Why? You're an unexpected attraction in my monotonous life. Us? Are you surprised? You know nothing about him. Waldo took him in, raised him, taught him everything. He's made a man out of him. His place is here, he has to be with us. It's obvious, although it's better for everyone to choose their own place, isn't that right? Be careful, this could end badly. Who are you thinking of now? Me? Him? Or yourself? What do you want from him? What are you after? And these books… The fool reads them all night long. You need him. But what for? It's… I can assure you it's not what you're thinking. How do you know what I'm thinking? I do. You're a bad man. Perhaps. May his star of prosperity Never sputter out Never sputter out And who doesn't drink with us May he be struck with gout And who doesn't drink with us May he be struck with gout Best wishes! Bravo! Silentium! Silentium! Here's a toast to give you life penned by yours truly and his wife. Let us drink to the manager Our tireless forager Our future will be clear - When there are no more arrears. - That's right. That is what we wish for you, Julian, Ina, and the crew. Bravo! Thank you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, really. And remember - Waldo's got your back! Hear, hear! Best wishes. And now… For you. Come on, boys! Voilà! What's up with you? I'm worried. I know, I know. It started when you started seeing that geezer. You've changed. What did he say to you? You wouldn't understand anyway. Kid. - And stop following me. - Why do that? It's not for you. Zygfryd. Stanisław? Stanisław! I've missed you. How about you? Me too. Why, hello there. Let's swap, Romeo! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Animals. You were right. I came. I'm glad you did, I was missing… Someone, here. Are you in trouble? I'm completely wasted. Stanisław will make you coffee, Is something wrong? Hello. So that's how it is. I'm sorry, but I preferred the other one. He had mystery. Now it's just unambiguous blackmail, which is unfair. You honestly think so? Naturally. It got too complex and twisted. For what? I mean, all great things are simple and don't require reason. Homer is simple, Christ is simple. But now we have the full scene, a complete story. And something in me objects to the cruelty of this scene. But you have to admit that only now is the real story revealed, and a new world discovered. Discovering new worlds? Whatever for? To bring new suffering to them? Is that what you want? Go and see it up close. It's still worth it. The boy loves climbing to the top. Enough with the irony, my dear friend. You're witnessing the birth of a new man. Yes. You don't realize the impact these couple of days will have on the rest of his life. I haven't felt such joy in ages. I'm only now beginning to understand the nature of humanity. Isn't it a bit too late to be establishing such fundamentals? I'm sorry, I misspoke. It's never too late. He has evil eyes, just like me. Tell him everything about this fresco. Its story, its message, its meaning. He's bright and intelligent, he'll understand. Are you sure that's what an acrobat needs? I hope so. There's a chance that from now on he'll lead a less trivial existence. Is that bad? I don't know. What don't you know? If it will work. Here you go. There! Look. What do you think? Several plain shirts, and definitely a blue one. Definitely a blue one. What's your collar size? Never mind I'll measure it myself. Where shall I send them? - To my address. - Certainly. What a horrible day, the air is like molasses. I'm exhausted. Drink? Just a drop. I'm performing today. Did… Maria talk to you? Why do you ask? She was here. Here? In the street, the day before yesterday. Shall I serve the snack, sir? Sirs. No, thank you. Maybe you would like to see the circus? I'm not really a fan. May I go, master? Yes, you may go. Why do you tease him so? We have a score to settle. A score? With the help? You're right, I didn't think. The light is strange, have you noticed? It's very beautiful, I saw this painting. They were sitting in a garden. - Do you like it? - Very much. I would imagine. Why are you…? Maybe you remind me of someone? Who? I don't know. Maybe me. Really? Yes, I too was once young. Look to your left. More. Turn your head. I'll draw your portrait. I'll draw your portrait. We'll take advantage of the light. Certainly. But we need to hurry. Great, don't move. You look like Doryphoros. Who was that? A young man of perfect beauty. It's a good stage name! The Crown Trio and Doryphoros. Ladies and gentlemen, the Crown Trio and the magnificent Doryphoros. Take off your clothes. Take off your clothes. You're not shy, are you? I want to do a study of the human body. Do you know what the body is? It's nature's most successful creation. There's nothing more perfect. The human body has always been a source of inspiration, and an inexhaustible one at that. Already Praxiteles knew that true beauty cannot be demoralizing. Here is a man. Another man. This is also a man. The synthesis of beauty. You saw here the works of the greatest painters. The most perfect achievements of reason and talent, didn't you understand any of it? At all? Beautiful. But relax and shift your weight to your right leg. Do you love Maria? Don't move. Well? I think that's my business. So you do. That's the actual answer. You love and you suffer. I feel for you. Is this going to take long? Be patient, we've only just begun. Isn't this easier than waiting for the knife? So barbaric. I'm cold. I was scared for you then. Master Stefan? Music! So that's all we have left of him. Pull yourself together, we leave in an hour. Go see what that's about. He's thirsty. Then give him a drink. There's always something, it's impossible to focus. Stanisław. And close that door. Stop knocking, he's working. How about you go to sleep? Get some rest. Translation: Wojciech Góralczyk
