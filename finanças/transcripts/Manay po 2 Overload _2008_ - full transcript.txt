What are you wearing?! We're here to rob and not for a fashion show! - You told me to disguise, right? -You really... Honey, do you really feel hot? Or you just want others to see your bracelet? Hey you! - What are you doing?! -I'm doing it. Okay! Okay! Come on, honey. We might bump into someone rich... She might be interested with my bracelet and buy it... It'll be sold. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is it? Wear this bonnet so they won't recognize you. - I don't want to. It's cheap. -Come on! Wear it! I don't want to! You don't want to wear it? I like to... You really don't know how business works. - Do you like this? -Yes. It's dark. - Let's go to the cashier. -I can't see anything. - Let's go there. -Are you sure? Excuse me. Is it already Halloween? Not yet. This is a hold up! Give us all your things, jewelries, money, all the valuable things. The counter has more money. Oh no! This is so beautiful. VVS1. .75 carats? No. That's only .50. It only has a good cut. - Really? -Look at it. Stop chatting! Take that! Ok. This is a hold up! I'm taking this! Oh my! Wait a minute. This has happened before. You want... my body instead? Are you a lesbian? I don't want that! I have my own! It's even bigger! - Am I right? -Oh... right. Your friend might want to try a different one. Sorry, he's my boyfriend. So it's not possible huh. That's why I'm robbing you! - Give me all of that! Hurry! -Wait a minute. HOLD UP! HOLD UP! Officer! Help us! Idiot! We're not the ones being robbed. We're the ones robbing them. You're being an idiot again! Let's go! We might get caught here! Oh my! Help us! Oh my! Oh my! That was close! Oh honey, you still haven't changed! Your mouth's bubbling again, honey! Mom, you're just going to buy a napkin and yet you're wearing the jewelry you're selling. You didn't learn your lesson. It's because... That's the only place where big pads are being sold. Oh my! Her napkin is this big! Really big! It's a special offer for special children. Aren't you going to stop? At least it didn't happen. You should've given the bracelet. It really happened. Oh my! Your Uncle Gerry and I were already robbed before. It won't happen again. By the way, Wait a minute. - You passed out when we were robbed before, right? -Yes. - But then, you passed out again? -Yes. Oh my. And that girl... ...even slapped me. Whatever! I don't know! I think her brain is lacking. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. By the way... What are you going to tell me? - You'll be having a grandchild! -What?! You already have an ovary? Where will it come out? - Here. -We're getting a baby maker. What?! BABYMAKER! Oh My! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. First of all... I'm too young to be a grandmother! Second... You might get someone from some place. Oh My! I don't like it! I want someone related to us! I'll not allow this! No! No really! Mom, we're still going to be the father. No, I won't let you! No! No! No! You're irritating. -Good morning. -Goodmorning Ma. My God, mom, it's too early to nag. It's because of your brother. This one. I will wait for my grandchild from Orwell. Mom, I'm too young. Mom, my little sister won't change anymore. Oh no... He will change. I will wait. I have faith in him. Orwell, your shoes are dirty. Where? See! I don't see anything. Aren't you going to eat breakfast? I'm on diet. This is probably why I'm wilting. The pest is here again! My God! How are you going to win Little Miss Philippines with that? Look at your legs. Long Hair! Thank God, my best friend's here! Best, come here. Let's go now because this bitter herb is turning sour again! Marky is waiting for us at the office. He said he has good news. Relax. Hi! sister! He's like a female version of Pacquiao. But you know what, I admire you and Marky. You're already hoping for him back in college. You could now write to “Wish K0 Lang...&quot; At least Pop and Martin stayed with us until NOW! ...unlike others. I'm just restraining myself! If not, he'll have a taste of me! You're the ones who betrayed me... ...and yet you're the ones mad at me. I thought we're best friends. But you stole my clients! What?! Stop that, Judy Ann Santos! Your clients chose us... Because they don't like your designs. that's a lie! You just can't take it... ...that I'm prettier than you. Right, you're beautiful! - You're a beautiful sea plant! -Ma'am, are we going now? Oh my! What's that?! No! I don't want to be grandmother! No! No! No! I've had enough! I'm so tired of my life here in Manila! Look at where we live. At the top of a building! It was better when we were in the province. Even though we are poor, at least we eat. And we're not hiding. Mother is right. What's the use of a palace, if the owner is an owl. A nipa hut is better, it is surrounded with different plants. We really can't go back there... because we are being sought out. See? So now, where are your promises?! You told me, I'll be an actress, and a beauty queen too! But nothing happened! You made me go through surgeries. There's an injection here... here... You had everything put on me. I can't even smile properly. But still, nothing happened to us. It's no use! No use! Hey, where are you going?! Let's go to the mall later. - On a date? -Yes. &quot;Right? -Hey. Hey, daydreamer Ida! Wake up, girl. It's already morning! He wants you to accompany him... ...to buy the latest issue of Icon and Valentino magazine. No! Daphne, Orwell is a man, okay? Fine! Fine! Section Immaculate. Yes sir. I'm Mr Padilla. Your new PE teacher. Oh my! That homo annoys me! He's irritating! I want coffee. He makes me crazy! That's your fault. You moved in a new village where Cher lives. Fine. Who would've thought that that impostor lives there? He'll kill me of a heart attack. He's not even Susan Roses. Oh my... This can't happen. I don't want stress today. I don't want tension. My wrinkles... It's good that my super best friend is here! I'm okay. I'm hereto tell you something. What?! You broke up with her?! And you realized that we're the ones destined for each other. That's not it. Gina and I will get married in a year's time. And I chose you to be my best man. Orson, aren't you happy for me? What? No! No! You're just playing with me, right? You're just playing with me. What you're saying is not true. I don't believe you. - I don't believe you! -My sister's getting crazy! - That's not true. -Are you okay, sister? - Are you okay? -That's not -- Are you okay? Ouch! I just wanted to let my emotions out! I thought you're getting crazy. You're just playing with me, right Marky? You're so funny! It's true. Hey! What did you do to my sister, Marky?! Orwell right! Sir! You're good. Surprisingly good. Why aren't you on the varsity team? I'm just inspired, sir. I mean, I'm just shy to try out. I will have a try out next week. For the inter university meet. I expect you to be there. Do you best. I will definitely show my best. Are you sure you can do it? I don't think so. But I'll try. You mean nothing happened between you and Pauline during that 6 years? - Your friend left me! -Why? - Yesterday, you were happy. What happened? -He left with that baby maker! That lesbian! Those fools left me! That's enough. What? Why are you smiling? - Hey... -What now! You told me you want to have a baby. You even have the guts... Do we have food to feed the baby? We don't have enough food for you and yet you want to have a baby. And life is like a wheel... sometimes, you're on top... and sometimes it's at the vulcanizing shop. Just wait. Here. Could you read this, babe? Read this one. See? Perfect! Perfect my ass! What are you thinking?! I can't give my own baby away. And the father would be gay? I don't want to. I really don't want to. Never ever! Over my dead body. Are you sure she can still get pregnant? She looks familiar to me . Right, mom. She looks familiar. Miss... Are you sure you still can make a baby? I still have my monthly periods. - That's her! -You're right. That's her! It's Mystika! Excuse me! I can do splits better than her! Maritess, where is she? You told me she's here. She's already here. She suddenly disappeared. So where is she now? Where is she? Where is she? You really... See - Sorry, I just tied up my shoe lace. Little girl, could you stand up? I'm already standing. Take that. Your baby will be a bonsai. You're too much. Miss... Are you sure you can do this kind of work? You can even include two people. Amazing! Oh! She disappeared again! - Maybe she's under the table. -Where are you? Maritess, look for her! It's a dwarf... Stop that! Just look for her! That's my seat. You're overreacting. Are we done? Yes we're done. Ok we'll just call you. What do you think? - Is she qualified? -Yes. You know what? You look familiar to me. A lot of people look like me... and I joined a beauty contest. It's Miss Forest in the City... in Sorsogon City. and I believe in the saying that... Behind the clouds there are airplanes. You know that saying? Is this your first time to do this kind of work? No. I just need money because... ...it's my mom... She's sick. You're from a rich family? ...and your address here is a Penthouse. Oh my! Ouch! You know what? You really look familiar to me! Maybe in your dreams? Maybe you've dreamt of your grandchild through me... ...who looks like me. You know what, tita... -Stop! Don't call me tita (close older female). You're not yet accepted. Ya, dude . You know. What my mom told me. Don't count the chickens... ...if you have ducks. Hey! Who between the two of will be the... Only him. I don't do the same gender. Could you stand up? Turn around. To your right again. Turn around again. That's difficult! Just like a beauty contest. But it's okay. She's the one, mom. We'll call you ok? Don't call us. Today? No. -In the future. -Like? When? Go now. We're done. Which one? The interviews done! You can go now! I don't have a gown. - Everybody joins, okay? Bye. - Okay. Bye. Don't tell me you're joining that. No. And that's on our swim meet. You mean when that two doesn't have the same date, you're joining? I thought... ...you're not like your brother Orson. Promise. I'm not. Let's not push through with it. The mother has deep instincts. The mother of those gays. She's scary. She might recognize me. Just don't let her find out. And... Don't be an idiot. And another thing... Don't go after her jewelries just yet. Okay- Thank God the guy is cute. At least, you won't know he's gay. I'm sure... ...he can't do it. Well, if there's a well... there's water. How can I refuse Oscar? Our life's better because of Adrian and him. Just like this house. They built it. And they even gave Orson money for his business. And they are sending Orwell to school. They even helped me with my speech defect. Aren't you insecure? You and Gerry... You don't have a child yet. Hey! I'm not yet menopausal! Gerry and I just don't have time. But you know, Bette is pretty. I'm sure your grandchild will be really cute. I don't think I'm ready for a grandchild! And I'm prettier than her. Me... At least I have something bewtween my ears! While she only have something between her legs. What's something between my ears? Earwax? Idiot! No! That means I'm okay. And come to think of it... She called me 'tita'. I'm not that old! - Honey! -Yes?! I didn't do anything! I'm not the killer! Honey, calm down. She's the actress who will buy your jewelry. She's Summer Rain. It's Summer Rain. I was just surprised. How are you? I'm so glad to meet you. Hello Tita! Are you my niece?! Are you my niece?! Take off my bra. Ok.. There you go. Thank you. Take off my panty. Next time, when I'm living with you, don't use my clothes. - Give me that! -You're selfish. I just want to see if it looks good on me. What now? Let's try another time! Please... You're disgusting. - You can do it. -No. Believe me. My God! Believe me, Bette. Believe me. I can't do this. - Is it okay? -My God! What is this? Disgusting! Bette, that's enough! I will grow scales because of you. I'm not a lesbian. I might get kicked out of our federation. I really can't do it. Maybe next time. Well... no Guts, no Glory. No I.D. No entry. Tomorrow, I'll be living at Oscar's house. So we can finally make a baby. At first, you don't want to do it. And now... You can't wait. Maybe... You like that gay. Idiot! We're already there so better do it right. Hey. Hey. When you are able to make one... Ask for a down payment right away. What about considering Tita Luz's jewelry as payment? That's good and... ...take some more. - Ouch! -Smart *ss! You're letting me get pregnant yet you want me to steal. Hey, this is beautiful. How many payments? Give me a discount. - Hello! -Hello! No. No. She's not my friend. My God! - I didn't mean to. Sorry. -My God. You're such an idiot. Marites... Take her to her room. Which room? - To your room! Idiot! -To your room! Idiot! Take this. I'm sorry. I'm beautiful but I'm kind. I didn't mean to. It's just my weakness. Okay, go. You always pair me with different people. There's a massage therapist. There's a dancer. There's a dance instructor. Hey! Papa Marky's good looking and he's classy. Who do you want me to replace him? A cheap one? Girl, you're so choosey. You're choosey! Whatever. - Oh My God! Stop! Stop! -Girl. why?! - Okay! -He's so handsome! Stop! He might get away! Stop! Stop the car! My God! Why are you hiding? Don't be scared! Pervert! Oh My God! That man's a robber! - What happened? -He's so handsome. I think he's the man of my-— - There's blood! -Man of your dreams?! He's dead. No. I will not let this happen. Girl... He still has a heart beat and it says... Orson Orson Orson Actually, we should give him a mouth to mouth resuscitation. What?! You're such a pervert! Let's take him to the hospital. Miss! Come here! Help us! Wait a minute! I didn't mean to! Help us out here! Not there! Let's go! Let's carry him! Oh no! Let's go. When we have a baby, I want a baby boy. I want a girl so we can have a girl in this house. Girl? But we're all girls here. No! Hey, you're tickling me! Hey, you're tickling me! May I join? Bette, what are you doing here?! We should try one more time. What do you mean take two?! I'm don't like floor shows! Get out of here! You will undergo artificial insemination! You're too sensitive. We could have a threesome. Yuck! Hey... Bette. You scared him. Fine! Let him go! At least... ...we could try once more. Bette, what's happening to you? Mommy, Bette's possessed! Hey! It's okay. If at firstt you don't succeed... Tomorrow is another day. We're done with the CT scan. There's a lesion at left temporal lobe of the patient. Theree might be some damage. He can have amnesia. - Doc, could you repeat it? -Hey! I think I only understood amnesia. When we removed the patient's clothes... we didn't find any wallet. You took his clothes off? What did you find out? Was he a biggie? Hey! What's the real name of the patient? Oh! Girl, you're not needed here. You're not needed here. - Are you sure? -Yes. - Okay. -Just call me. I'll call you. I'll even text you. Doc? Continue. The patient's name. His name is ... Marky. Murky? As in Murky Waters? You're irritating, doc. He's my boyfriend. Oh I see. good day. You know what? Pasig is really murky. Doc. Congratulations! He's really a biggie. -Good day! -Good day! Shall I touch? Or shall I not touch? This must be pure. Mother. This must be love. Here. So the artificial insemination would be successful. Do I have to fill it up? No! You can't fill that all up. Here are some girls. These may help. Not that, doc. That won't make him stand. I brought mine. Here. It's good you brought it. Alright see you later. Doc, can't I come with him in the room? - He might need audience participation. -Oh sir... ...that's not allowed in our company policy. Good luck. Just think of me. Doc, do you know have sex change? How much is sex change? We don't offer that service. In 2 months, we'll find out if the procedure is successful. Really? It seems like you're certain that there's a baby already. Your semen is weak. Mom, you're irritating. He's right, Tita Luz. It's like you don't want Oscar to have a baby. She's right. What about your jewelry? It would be a waste. Who will inherit that? Jewelry? - Good evening, tita! -Honey! Honey! Don't be too loud. I'm accepted. I'll be happier of you stop calling me tita! And stop kissing my husband! Honey, I won't be having dinner here tonight. We'll be having a reading. What reading? A mass? Tita is so funny! We'll be having a reading for the movie's script. Honey, I'll be a good actor here. This is for you! Honey, we'll go now. We'll go now. Bye. - What?! Bring my husband back! -Bye, tita! What reading? What's reading? Reading... What was I saying about the jewelry? What was it? You were very obvious. You're insecure with Summer. Hey. I'm not insecure. She's just taller and her arm's smaller but with the face value, I win. Honey... Do you like this, honey? Honey! Honey! I worked hard for this! You like this, right? Just like Summer Rain. Like this. Hey! Hey! You passed out again! It's hard to practice this! Hey you! Hey! That tickles me! Stop it! Catch me first. Hey! Not on top of the fridge! An angel. You know what? I've been dreaming about you. It's good you're awake. Who are you? What happened to me? Don't you remember me? I'm your girlfriend. We fought. I ran after you. Unfortunately... you were hit by a Steamroller. Steamroller? Yes. The road in front of us is under construction. I don't remember anything. I don't even remember my name. But I think it starts with... ...the letter R! There's also R! Maybe you just jumbled it because of your head. I'm Ursula. I'm your girlfriend. Hey... You even know all the parts of my body. Remember? Girlfriend? But you're not a girl. That'll come. I just need boobs. Wig and... It's already cut? Not yet. Almost. Your lunch is here. Go eat now. Oh! It's blood! Take that out! I don't like that! There's blood! He doesn't like blood! Take that out! Replace it with steak! We don't have steak here in the hospital. There's none? Oh Okay. Anything will do! Anything else! Okay- Why? Are you sure... What? ...you're a real man? I can't remember. Hey, we're already late. Hey, girl! There you go. Fill that up today. I'll be the one to submit. I'm still not sure. Come on. You know what? We, goddesses, are born for one purpose. To be a beauty queen. So don't fight destiny. The patron of gays might get mad at you. Who is it? It's San Rio. He's the patron? Yes. Hello Kitty? What are you doing here? We have training, right? Oh. I thought we could have lunch together. Papa sir and veggie Ida, We have an assignment and today's the submission. - We'll go now. -Bye. Hurry. Are you Orwell's girlfriend? Yes. You're very lucky. He's diligent, smart and kind. Perfect boyfriend. Thank you. - Are all your things in there? -Yes, mommy. - Are you sure? -lt's complete. Everything's so sudden. Mother! I'm old enough. I want to experience being independent. But you know what? I think that you're hiding something from me. Me? Oh, I just want to change my view! La Vendetta might release her angst! My God! Are you mad at each other? No, mother. We're close. We're like this. This is me and this is him. Oh mother, I want Orwell to be the one to use my room. Because I don't trust that Bette. You know, son, you're right. I'm also having suspicions. Even her being stupid looks fake. We can't do anything. She's there already. But, mother... ...we should take it... ...that you and Tito Gerry (close older male) won't have a child anymore. You will soon be a grandmother. That's the truth. Is it dense if you're menopausal? - Hey! &quot;Oh My God! I'm not yet menopausal. I even use ultra thin... ...with wings. Oh! Such a snob! Ate Vi!(actress) We need a transformation! Take care. Mom's so chubby! Bye House! What are you doing here?! Why are you using that?! Give me that! Why are you using this?! Hey! Your mom told me to stay here. Hey... are you a gay? I saw lots of magazines in the drawer, men showing their--- All four of you are gay? Mommy! Mommy! You're shouting! What is she doing here? Transfer her to Kuya Orson's! (elder brother) Your brother doesn't want to. He wants you to stay there. Mom, look what she did with my things! She's using it! Bette What a big mouth. It's because... what are these-- ...like this picture here... This is Ugly. I'm Bette. She's my best friend. Ugly... Bette. Come on. Come on let's go. What was that? A young gay? They're all gay? Even the mother's gay? At least it's not obvious. Sir, here's the revised version. Girl, what's new? Girl, what happened to the victim? I don't know. Maybe he already left. Why do you ask? Oh My! Missing! So your name is Rainier Tecson. Oh why? Marriage? We're getting married! Girl, that's kidnapping. So now you're a kidnapper. Where is he now? I don't care about that. Maybe he already left. Girl... If you really love him... If you really love me... Just give me this little time to be happy. This is the only happiness I have. Are you going to take that away from me? Why? Did you ask him if he's happy? But the right guy will come for you. I can't wait anymore. This is too much. We're here at the beach. It's too expensive. It's okay. So we can bond. And so we can get to know her, right? Oh! The witch is smoking! You're right. Bette, why are you smoking? Your bio data says that you don't smoke. It's because I'm nervous. And... we're still not sure if I'll get pregnant. Why don't you want to tell me? It's hard. It's not that easy. You know how life is. It's like a rock. It's hard. That's your call. If you're ready to talk, I'm here. Besides, I'm going to be the father of your baby. Let's go inside. The gown's here are beautiful. Really? So beautiful! Go choose yours! That one has a good color. It'll fit you. Right? I don't want to wear a gown. Hey! You won't have points in the gown competition. The miles will be wasted. Come on. Let's go in. You might see what you like. Come on! I like this. That's perfect for the casual dress competition. Not for me. For Ida. Her birthday is near. Why will you buy her a dress? Why? Are you sisters? Don't tell me, you're becoming a lesbian because of her? Can it be? Oh My God! The Earth will open! Heaven will be mad! And most of all... you will become a driftwood! You're one cheap drag artist! Drag queen! Homo! Hey, get out of there! Where's Oscar? He's at the hospital with Bette. They have an appointment with the doctor. I need two signatures. I have a new testament. I'm taking out Erwin in my will. That witch doesn't even want me to see my sweetie pie. What now? He's not my boyfriend and yet I have a baby to take care? - But still that's your baby. -That's their own. Not my blood! And believe me! Same thing will happen to you when that girl will give birth. Just don't forget what we talked about. No newspapers will be brought here, okay? -Hi Baby!. Good morning! -Hi! Oh. I have good news for you. - What is it? -The doctor said... ...you can get out of the hospital in 2 weeks time. - Really? -That's why I bought you clothes! - Wow! Those are good! -This one will look good on you. This one too. You have already spent too much for my hospitalization. This is too much. Don't I have clothes in our house? When we fought... before I ran after you... I burned your clothes. Even our house burned down. 48 families homeless. What?! Didn't they look for you? You really... It's just a joke! Can't I joke you around, Rainier?! Rainier? Rainier! That's right! Rainier is my name! Yes, it's Rainier! Your second name is Rainier! My God! Go ahead! Take a bath. You... Do you want me to go with you so that... ...l'll be the one to scrub the germs off your body? Can I do it myself first? I'm not yet used to it. And I don't remember someone giving me a bath. Okay- If that's what you want. I can't do anything. You're really kind. Maybe that's the reason why... ...l'm with you. My God! What do you want? Polo? Pants? I'll give you anything! Cell phone? New cell phone? Trip to Boracay? For just the 2 of us! -I'll do it for you. - That's enough. I'll take a bath first. ♪ Here comes the bride. ♪ ♪ All dressed in white. ♪ ♪ Ready to Whoo! ♪ ♪ With my husband tonight. ♪ My God! I'm a beautiful bride! My God! It's honeymoon already! Ursula, I'll take a- Your blush don't matched. Your make-up's too thick. You haven't curled your lashes. You haven't plucked your eyebrows. Your eyebrows are too thick. Your warts... ...it's too many. You can really see it. Discoloration of skin... You haven't cleaned your ears. I'll take a bath. My God! I think my investment is a mistake. But I love him. Sorry, ma'am. But I saw them in a motel. What? A cheap one? or High class? The one like this... or the one with an apple? The girl is like... like... like this... What else? What else? Then there are a lot of guys. There are girls too. They went in that same room. All of them! Oh my! It's so disgusting! That Summer is a whore. And Gerry went with her! Hey, Ate Bette! Maybe you're pregnant! I suddenly feel bad. Come. Come in. I don't remember this as my house. Don't we have any pictures? It's a long story. We were mad at each other before... When we fought, I burned all our pictures... Before we transferred here. This is our new house! Is this it? Hey. That... Those are my friends. How about me? Do I have any friends? I remembered... ...they're from Baguio. - And I'm from Baguio too! -My God! From Baguio? You really... You know what? You might get sick again. You go rest now. You go rest. If not, I might burn some pictures again. Do you want that? Wait a minute! (shouting)Hello Bette! - You surprised Bette again! -Got slapped by the idiot again. Bette. Are you Ok? I'm okay. - I was just surprised. -lt's because of Tess. I have good news! - Bette's pregnant! -Bette's pregnant! Are you okay, Bette? I'm okay. I just got excited. - We have a baby now! -That's only yours. It's ours. We'll register the name of the baby... as Dimagiba-Pengson. Alright then! Before I go back home, I have to do some grocery. My wonderful wonderful sister-in-law... - Do you want something? I'll buy anything. -Okay. Okay. I want something sour. Green mango... Pomelo, Tamarind... Kamias... Or what about something sweet? Water melon, apple... Just buy her fruit cocktail. - Mother, that's cheap. -That'll fit. Okay, I'll go now. Bye. Thanks for the fresh fruits! - Why are your here? -Oh gay! This is not mine! This is Daphne's. What do you want from me? Because I lost my ring. My mother gave it to me. I just left it here. You really look like a diva. Is that you, Regine? Why don't you believe in me?! You don't believe it yourself so why would I believe it? Remember... Honesty is the best policy. But we need cash. Especially me! Are you used to wearing a dress? So don't force yourself. Look at Oscar. Even though he's gay... he still wears manly clothes. Orson is the only one who looks really gay. You know what? I just feel that... I just feel that... You're similar to Oscar than Orson. - Really? -Yes, promise. Thank you. Come on. Let's look for your ring. Hurry. Come on. Shoot that! Hurry! You shoot it! You're too slow. - What are you playing? -Hurry! Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot! Hey! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! You're pregnant and you're playing war games. It's better to do this so that if I have a boy, he won't be like you. Attitude! You're playing with a gay! The one who made that baby, is gay too. So if that baby will be like us, it's not about what you are playing! Hey you. You're making me crazy. I don't want to play now. See? I don't have someone to play with now. Go try to shoot that. Let's see if you can fight me. Fake sister in law. What do you think? Does it fit me? Is it okay if I borrow this? I don't have anything to wear at the condo. Hey! Why are you wearing my clothes?! - Take that off! -My God! Hey you! You perverted oyster! You're a shellfish! Scallops! What did he say? He said you're selfish. He said too many things only for the word selfish. There are oysters, scallops... -shellfish... -Shellfish?! You want me to cook shellfish? Bette, I tried on your lingerie. Why are you all wearing my clothes?! What do you think I am?! A second-hand clothes shop?! You're so arrogant! Ouch! Ouch! That's enough! That's enough! - Ouch! Ouch! That's enough! -Hit him! Hit him! Take that off! You... You're so pretentious... You... I saw you the other day... You tried her bra on. The gay is wearing a bra. full stroke! full stroke! Come on! Hurry! You're gay? - Your son took advantage of me! -Took advantage?! So there. Your son took advantage of him! No, principal! Be ashamed of what you're saying! My son was drowning! You're the one who kissed him! He just hugged him! Principal, it's already lasciviousness?! So the boy just needed your support! What did you do?! - Mrs., I just gave him mouth to mouth resicitation! -Resuscitation! - Resuscitation! -There! He suddenly hugged me! - So there! -He gave malice to what I did! Mrs., your son is malicious! Principal! maybe he just wanted to show his appreciation. He was wanting to show his appreciation. - What did you give him?! -Whatever! If you remove my son from the swim meet... I will sue this school! I will make you into a headline! - Let's go. This school's nonsense! -Mrs., wait! What's wrong with you? The boy just needed your support yet you can't give it to him. He lust hugged you! Why?! Haven't you been hugged before?! He changes his clothes at the locker. I can smell his gayness from here. Let's go. Son, I already told you... ...it's okay to be gay. Why do you have to hide it? I don't want to go to school anymore. Hey. You have to fight. There's nothing wrong with being gay. It's worse if you're a liar and a coward. Maybe you could stay at Orson's room first. Bette wants a big bed. Don't tell me she wants the bed because she's pregnant. Honey. Fine! You go sleep together. Go curl your hairs. Have a make over... Use her lingerie again. You're too much! Do you want me to sleep here? You can stay upstairs. For what? So I can sleep beside Ugly Bette? No, thanks. You get mad so easily. Goodnight. I love you? I love you too. I'm one pregnant diva. My face is so beautiful Wherever I go the guys run after me the others can't compete with us. We're pregnant beauty queens. Our crowns are really big to prove that we are beautiful. I'm the queen of the ramp. Even though I'm already pregnant, I'm the pregnant goddess whom no one can beat. You can't fight me. Your beauty is just an illusion. I'm the real beauty. A beautiful pregnant! Bombo Lobo, when she gets pregnant Gorgeous preggy, no one else can beat her. Bombo Lobo, a beautiful preggy. A beautiful preggy. Preggy, preggy. Beautiful preggy. Preggy, preggy. Gorgeous preggy. Bombo Lobo, when she gets pregnant Gorgeous preggy, no one else can beat her. Bombo Lobo, a beautiful preggy. A beautiful preggy. Adrian, wake up! Wake up! What is it? Bette wants a sweet and spicy tamarind. Tamarind? Sweet? And spicy? Then go to the airport, board a plane and go to Thailand. You're such a snob. It's there, ate. There... There... Why are there so many people? I told you this before, right? That there are a lot of boys and girls who go in and out of the room. What? Are you going to Gerry? I don't know. We should see it first. There. There's a girl. Let's see. Why are there so many lights? You're right. Maybe someone's dead. Honey! Honey! Oh My! Why do you look like that? Your thingy! Why are you wearing that?! We have a shooting here! What is this?! Why?! What's your role? I was supposed to be scared in this scene. Then I won't be able to move. There's the director. It's a shooting. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Why do you have to get jealous? That's just a shooting. It's embarrassing to the director. Please forgive me. You don't want to go to school?! Because they found out that you're gay?! Are you the only one gay in your school? But kuya, it's still embarrassing! She asks too much. When my mom was pregnant, she wasn't like that! You know what, Adrian? You're just jealous! You're jealous! You should accept who you are before other people will accept you. I'm not ashamed of myself because of this! I'm ashamed because I had to pretend! Bette and I didn't do anything. - You're the one I love. -That's what Rewin said to Rowell. Hey! Don't be too loud! I was sleeping. What about the baby? The baby might have a memory gap. It's you! Because of you! And you too! Hey. Hey. What was it? I can't hear anything. What is it? They walked out? They don't like me? Oh my... It's good you took me out. I get suffocated at home. How can I? Ever since that Bette came... everybody's fighting. Oscar and Adrian are always fighting. Orson got kicked out of the house. And Gerry's always mad at me. But mommy... It's not Ate Bette's fault why you and Uncle Gerry fight. You... You should be siding with me. I'm your mother. Whatever, mommy. You can just tell me to be mad at Ate Bette. I'll follow you anyway. What should I do? Ate Luz... - Am I seeing right? -Why? Is that Summer Rain and your Gerry? He will accept the baby. What's the meaning of this?! Hey! How dare you?! - Ma'am! Don't! -Hold this! Ma'am don't! Full stroke! Fullstroke! Hurry! Keep doing it! - Ma'am! -Hurry! Full stroke! The water's only knee-deep! Stand up! Stand up! Hurry! Hurry! Oh! A Squid! - What squid?! -Where? What's the meaning of this?! Nothing! He was just trying to comfort me. Honey... She asked me to stay with her because she has a problem! She's pregnant! She's pregnant?! The Japanese got her pregnant! I don't care! Everybody's pregnant! I'm tired of this! How dare you! Honey! We will do something about it! It's the first day of the rehearsals tomorrow. If you don't come, you'll be kicked out. It's up to you. How? It's the start of the selection for our swim meet. Do they still talk about me at school? Of course. They still talk about you. Where's the future Miss Gay University? Why isn't she here? Is she scared of the competition? You know, you shouldn't waste this golden opportunity. This is your moment! The wheel of fortune is in your hands! So, push your luck... before you lose it. No! I'm not going to that show! The lesbian is here! You already missed a lot of homework. I miss you best friend. She's taking my role. I'm sorry. Maybe we're not meant for each other. There's still 'us'. As soulmates. There, Daphne. We're not best friends. You finally learned your lesson. It's because you girls don't bring salt in your bags. So if ever you see your crush... throw some salt on them. If they grow scales, then they're mermaids. Whatever. But you should go to school tomorrow, Orwell. - I look like a blind man in this outfit! -Of course not! You look good! It's in fashion! Don't say that... - Let's hurry up! The impostor is here! -Why? Hey! Oh my! Honey, are you okay? Are you hurt? Who... who are you? H-honey... S-sir... I'm sorry. I pushed you down the escalator that's why your head got hit. Where's my phone? - It's gone! -Here! Here! You can use mine. What? I have been lost for 5 months! Just pick me up here in SM Megamall. I think this is yours, too. Thank you. OMG! You don't only cheat in the business. You're a two-timer in love! I brought you some juice. It's Orwell. Let's get out of here. He might look at our... The inter-university meet is near. Do well, especially you. Orwell. What are you doing here? I came here for practise. You've been gone for two weeks. I have replaced you. If they win against me, I'm backing out. Ok! Ok everybody. Let's have a contest! Don't let those monsters defeat you. - Swim well! -Of course! You're better than them! Do some warm-ups and stretch! You swim better than them! You can do it! You're so good! Let's go girls! I still have to rehearse for Miss Gay. Is there money inside? What do you think of my tummy? A piggy bank where they put money every month? We already have the half of the down payment! Tell them you need money. Your mother is sick. No! Why do I have to say it? I will not. It's embarrassing. Embarrassing?! -Ouch! You better be embarrassed if you get a miscarriage! Isn't there a saying that 'a couple who's honest, sticks to the knife.' What? Can I please ask money for shopping? Please... my clothes are already old... What? Do you need clothes again? What? How many do you need? Are you turning this into a business that- Mom, let her be. She seldom asks. Let's give in. Do whatever you want. Isn't it embarrassing? How much do you need? - It's just for shopping. -2,500 pesos? Are you sure? - How much is this? -2,500. It's really happening. Are you excited? Of course! - Sister! -What? What? The church for the wedding got burned down?! Orson! No. There's a school homecoming. They're having a Santacruzan. All the past winners and runners-up of Miss Gay are included. Since you're a winner, you're the Reyna Elena. What do you say? Who would be my escort? Who else but me! What are best friends for. - Oh my God! Ouch! -Why? - You hit my crotch! -I have been telling you to tuck it! Hey Bette! We need to talk. What are you really? A girl. That's not what I meant. What's your job? Baby Maker. We went to that penthouse address that you gave us. It was only a rooftop. I even saw a guy... that looks like someone I've seen before. He called me a while ago. It's my brother. We're like that. Why would I lie? Fine but remember this Bette! You're not going to get past me. My husbands were... a soldier... a holdupper... a holdupper... and a stuntman. That's why I feel good when I'm with you even if you hate me! Birds of the same feather.. make a good feather duster! Whatever, Bette. Remember this. That was awesome! That was amazing! Ouch! Bette's giving birth! - Call an ambulance! -Call the police! The police? You should call a taxi! Call the captain! Call a doctor! Wait a minute! - No car? You're so cheap! -Wait. Aren't you still on your 6th month? The baby might still have 4 fingers! Practice only! It was just a joke! Remember. Practise makes perfect. She's not funny! Sister, relax. Sis without an ovary... What did you say? I said you have no ovary... and the hair... That's a lot. I can't take it anymore. Just once. He pulled her hair! Faint! Adrian. Adrian, she's a girl and pregnant. You didn't have to pull her hair! I've been putting up with her for so long! I can't take it anymore! So she can give birth safely, I'll stay with my mom first! Just text me if she's given birth already! Adrian, I need you here! Adrian, I need you here! Both of us are the father! You know what, somehow, I don't feel it. What will I do without you? What will happen to our office? You can do it alone! I can't do it alone, Adrian! Our ofice can't work if we're not together! You're lucky you're happy. I was left alone. I let myself in. The door was already open so I came in. I was hoping you'd be here. You didn't tell me what really happened to me. You hid me from my family. You made me believe that you were my boyfriend. But... you took care of me. You didn't leave me alone. You didn't force me. For that. Thank you. Rainer I'm sorry, too. We saw you that night. Then, we followed you. Then, we saw you lying on the ground You lost your memory. I didn't know what... what to do. I didn't know where to take you. I'm really sorry! Before... a lot of gays tried to woo me. I was really annoyed. I felt that they were just going to use me. But because of you... my view changed. My name's Orson. I'm Ursula at night. Orson, I have something important to say to you. But you might... not like my job. The reason why I know a lot on make-up... ...and why I don't like Dinuguan... ...is because... ...we own a funeral parlor in Baguio. I'm the... embalmer. What? So, that's why sometimes... you smell like formalin. Orson! Hey, Why are you smoking? You said that smoking is bad. Do not do unto others. For the sun will come out tomorrow. Right? I'm not the one pregnant so it's okay for me to smoke. I'm sorry for acting that way to Adrian. I'm just probably fond of him. Am I already a burden here? Your mom and I can't get along. Only you and Orwell could understand me. You really love Adrian, don't you? Of course. A lot. I'm siding with you because you're pregnant. But once the baby is born. I will do everything to get Adrian back. And hopefully... you won't be here anymore. -...there! -Oh, it's Adrian! I thought you're not coming. Why? I fought with Oscar, not with you. My son misses you already. Why aren't they here? Her tummy's hurting. Your brother-in-law is cute! Here! Didn't you say I should bring iodized salt? Oh, no need for that. It's confirmed. - He's also gay? -Do your best! Here's your other escort. How are you? - How are you? Oh! -l'm okay. By the way, this is Marky. This is Rainer. I hope it's fine with you guys if both of you are my escorts... since I'm the Reyna Elena here. And who said that you're the Reyna Elena? You might want to look at the list to see who's the Reyna Elena. I'm in charge of the event. And why would I want you to be the Reyna Elena? Sister? Are we going to fight even here? I know you're in a gown already. But I didn't know where you got that. But what I know is... that this is for the past winners of Miss Gay. Aren't you a second runner-up winner? - Because I want to! -No, he's only third. Look at what you're wearing! It doesn't suit you! You look liked you passed by Lumen's clothesline. Are you feeling like a princess?! Sister!. Super twins activate! The power... of make-up... with the light... We're the twin powers of the gays! We are the Super Gays! You think you're pretty! You're not! You have an ugly dress! Baldhead! It's too thick! What? This competition isn't about natural beauty! Come on. Put on your wig and gown. But I don't want to! I can't wear a gown! What's wrong with you? You can't wear a bikini on your opening number! I have an idea! I thought you're in the Sagala. It's a long story. - Ouch! My belly hurts! -Why did you have to come anyway? Stop it, mom. Of course. I have to support Orwell. Here they come! I'm Marian DeVera... And I believe in the saying.. An apple a day is worth .. 15 pesos! Impressive! Good evening! I'm Angela Locsin! I believe in the saying... Keep off the grass! What happened to your brother? He's not in a gown! - Where's his gown?! -I don't know! Good evening everyone. I am Orwell Castello... representing the 4th year high school students. I believe in the saying that... it's not in the clothes... make-up or wig... to know the real gender of a person. But Still. I'm proud to be gay. Ouch! - I'm giving birth! - It's open! -Ah! Water! - I'm going into labor! -You're in labor now?! Help me! Hurry! Let's bring her to the hospital! Hurry! - Let's hurry! Something might happen to- aaahh! -Pregnant horse! Why are you still in a gown anyway?! So? Why do you care?! My God! I came as soon as I found out. Can you do that later? Because Bette's giving birth. It's so annoying. My fall was pathetic. It should have been like this. See? Just like a princess! Just beautiful. Hey! Get out of the way. People might pass. No one can pass by here! And Bette's giving birth... You know what? You're such a lucky girl. Hey! The two of you! Sit down! What's your problem? You're too tensed! - Just relax! Like me! -l'm tense! Excuse me. Mr.Dimagiba-Pengson. My God! How was it?! I was just carried away. It's just the two of them. So which of the two is Mr. Dimagiba-Pengson? I'm Mr. Pengson and he's Mr. Dimagiba. We're the father. We're gay. ls there a problem? Is this your first time... to see... two guys hug? Yes, just now. Do you want me to lend you a DVD? You don't have to. What happened? - Why is he so dark? -I know. Weren't you tricked? Lets have a DNA test. Mom will get mad at us again. Why did I have to see it? They're bringing him home anyway. Oh my! My grandchild is so cute! Oscar, it looks exactly like you! Mom, are you okay? Look at him! He's so dark. He looks like me? Whatever. I don't care. I could feel it. - It's my own blood. -Dear... we now have a baby! I really want a baby in our house! I feel envious of Summer. Gerry, what shall we do? I don't think I'll be pregnant anymore. Honey, it's okay. I still love you very much even if we don't have a baby. I will not find another lover. I don't think I can give my child away. Stupid! What's wrong with you! What? Can't you see that I just gave birth! Don't scare me like that! We won't be able to get the full payment! And the baby is so ugly! Bette. Why are you crying? It's nothing. I'm just like this. Sometimes sensitive, sometimes happy. By the way, this is my brother, Moxie. I'm fine. - How are you? -l'm okay. Bette, how are you feeling? Can I stay here for a week? I want to rest and... I want to be with my son even for a short time. Okay then. I have to take care of the bills. Okay? Let's go. I thank you so much for the wonderful baby. -Hi Bette! -Hi! Oscar's baby is so cute! Oh, I brought you some fruits! Wait, I think I recognize the two of you. Are you sure? Your face looks familiar. What? I think I've seen them before... somewhere. Honey, I swear I saw those two before. I'm just not sure where. Can you just forget about that? Now, I will be kind to Bette... because their baby is so cute! Baby's feeding time! Hurry up! We're leaving! Mom, didn't you tell me you have to meet a buyer of your jewelry? Yes, it's Summer. She wants to buy the bracelet that was nearly.... Bette and Moxie were the ones who tried to rob us before! Let's go! The baby's so cute! We went to the address that you gave us. But we found no one. - Oh my God! -We'll be going. We'll look for them. An unknown number. Answer it! Hurry! Hello? Who's this? - Who is it? -You know who this is. Do you still want to see your baby alive? Where's my baby?! Where is he?! Prepare five million pesos. I'll call you again tomorrow. If you tell the police... -you won't be able to see him again. Clear? -But... What did he say? Wait! It's Moxie! Moxie called! He's asking for a five-million peso ransom! He said we shouldn't tell the police! This is so interesting... Baby Marcus was just born... But he's kidnapped already, just like in TV dramas! Why did we come back here? - The police might follow is here! -lt's going to be fine. I've already told the guards. And I have visitors here. Is that the five million-peso baby? What's the meaning of this? Let's withdraw our time deposit honey! Oscar. Gerry and I, we have some extra money. Me, I can share... ...my money for my sex change-- -Me! Me! I have nothing. - It's okay my dear, you're still young. -You're still young. - It's Bette! -Oh my God! I'll switch it to speaker phone. Be quiet. - How dare you! Where's my baby?! -We're at the rooftop. He didn't know that I called you. Moxie still wants to sell my baby to a Chinese couple after he takes your money! I beg you! Please help me! Bring the gays with you! We need our army! Right now! An army of what? Of gays. Aren't we included? - I'm coming with them! -Me too! - Cher! I need your help! -What? Why are you bugging me this early?! My brother's son was kidnapped! So what's it got to do with me? What's it got to do with you? You're my sister in the federation! You have an obligation to help your fellow gay! If you don't, I will ban you. You'll be a lesbian! I still don't care. I'd be a monk then. It will be for your old friend who... is asking for your help. I'm so tired of Super Twins. Don't you miss... Charlie's Angels? I'm sorry, sister! I'm sorry, too! Wait, I'll change my clothes first. Sister, we're not going to a party. Let's go! Sir! Sir! - Why? -There are people outside! Meet them! - They're just gays. -Yes, sir. - You told them didn't you?! -No! It's already late and you're still selling manicures? Hey you! Where's my baby?! If you can get past us! - Give our baby back! -Really?! You can do it! I'll take care of it. - What do you mean by distract? -Just go with them! Come on! Let's hurry! Let's go! So who's gay now?! This is what you deserve! Kick him more! This is what you get! How dare you! Now what?! What?! How dare you! I'm going to throw this! I'm going to throw this! He's going to throw the baby! I'm going to throw this baby! Move! - Get out of his way! -Put your guns down! Don't come near me! Wait! - I will kill him! -Wait! Can we talk about this? - Don't follow me! -Don't go near him! - He might drop my baby! -Stay where you are! I will kill this baby! Come down here! Wait a minute! Listen to me! - Put your gun down! -Don't throw him! I'm not kidding! - What?! -Put your guns down. I still have something to say! - Leave or I'll kill him! -Wait! - I need the money! Leave! -Don't be annoying, Moxie! What are you waiting for?! - Mister Policeman, shoot him! -No! Don't shoot! I will drop him! No, it's okay! Shoot him! Do you want this baby to die? Don't shoot him! The baby might die! Don't! Don't! No, it's okay! He will not hit the baby! He's a sharpshooter! Shoot him! Shoot him! If you shoot him, the baby might fall! My grandson might die! Don't! Don't! No! Get on with it! Shoot him! We could catch the baby. Shoot him! What?! Should I throw him now?! I will throw the baby! No! We could catch it! Come on! Do it! Shoot him! Now! Shoot him! You killed my grandson! N0! I didn't kill him! Wait a minute... Here's the baby! Very much alive! My grandson! Oh my God! But wait a minute... Oh! I have been shouting at you but you don't listen to me! Why didn't you say immediately? I know how Moxie thinks. So I switched the baby. Between the two of us, I'm smarter. You're smarter than him? How dumb can he get? That's why he's shot! Stupid! Dumbass! - Idiot! -How dare you?! You didn't even notice... that the baby you're holding is fake! Stupid! How dare you hit me?! You think you're smarter! - That's enough! The baby! -That's enough, Bette. Where's the battle? You're too late! At least, the baby's alive! Rot in prison! You! Come with us. No, she's the mother of the baby! - Yes, sir! -Really? Okay then. Bette, don't leave him. Take care of him. Thank you very much. But... I would like to say something to all of you. You're probably wondering why the baby is dark. I'll admit it. I was really dark-skinned. I just used Glutathione that's why I became fairer. I knew it! I can't really give him. I have something to ask of you. What is it? When he's grown, tell him the truth. ...that he has two fathers. Tell him that... we love him very much. If you need money... just tell us and we'll send it to you. Thank you. Oh! It's Bette! You are tough. You're still alive? How many lives do you have? Nine? I'm serious. Please take care of him. What about you? I'm going to be fine. I'm used to being alone. Bette, thank you very much. Don't worry. We'll still give you your full payment. You don't need to. Can I make a request? Anything, Bette... anything. When the child's grown... ...please tell him that... ...his mother's not a bad person. I really need to give him away because his life will be better with you than with me. And please tell him that... I really love him. And... I will never forget him because... he's my first-born. Look! There's a clown! After the rain comes the storm. After the storm comes.... After the storm what? Flood! You guys are too serious. Honey... are you okay? Why are you sick? What did you eat? Honey... Honey! This is what we have been waiting for! (shouting)I'm pregnant! What was that? It was just gas pain.
