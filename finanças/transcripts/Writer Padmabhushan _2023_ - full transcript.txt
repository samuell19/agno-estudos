Subramanyam, what do you want to be when you grow up? Teacher, I want to be a politician. Bhoolakshmi, what about you? I want to be a doctor. And you Nagaraju? I will become a police officer. Look who's talking. You steal my erasers. Rani, be silent. Kids, shall I announce who won the essay writing competition this time? It’s the girls that won! Once upon a time in Vijayawada Madhusudhan Rao and Saraswathi have a lovely son That’s me! My love for books is as much as, the love my parents have for me, or the love our Telugu states have for cinema. Not just me.. Our entire Vijayawada loves books. Don’t believe me? Just google "Biggest book fair in Telugu states" and you will get to see our PWD grounds. The rarest of books can be found here. Even the author will be surprised to find his own book here. That.. is the speciality of our Vijayawada. Oh, and let me introduce myself.. Padmabhushan Though my name is an award in itself, the prefix 'WRITER' is the biggest award for me. My mother tells me that I picked a pen at my naming ceremony. And that became my passion and calling. Despite getting many good job offers I wanted to be surrounded by books. And that also led to writing my first book. Pay 1000/- more. But we are even. You hammered nails to the walls, pay up. But I didn’t know this before. You know now. You can’t fool me!. Here! Here! You paid 500/- extra. Take it back. I’m a very fair person. Hey Bhushan! You say you will be late by two hours and you came two hours before closing? So you rented out the library for a wedding again? Haha...Pay me and I'll rent it to you too. I’m not rich enough to rent this place. I’ll be happy if you give me my salary first. So you came only because it’s salary day today? No, no. Very soon.. Once I win that case, I'll demolish this library.. and build a huge multiplex with six screens... Hey! Maintain silence there. Every time I say this, he lashes out. I said silence! Sir, sir, sir, sir.. Hey, Who are you all? I mean..thanks for that.. Is there enough ink in my pen for all these autographs? I didn't know that you are such a great writer sir. Your writing feels like it came straight out of your heart. You write better than the greats like Sri Sri and Yandamuri. You are Bammera Pothana with a ball pen. An E.V.V Satyanarayana with an ink pen.. But uncle, isn’t E.V.V a film director ? Okay okay, don't rush guys, I can't sign as fast as I write! One minute! I’m signing as many as I can. Okay you need to stop pushing me now. I said stop! Stop! How silly! Humming a song.. Hello Sir. I ran out of ink in my pen. Can you please bring that one over there for me? Thank you sir. There you go. Make sure you read every one of them. Meet my one and only best friend.. Sowmithri. Wow! You have super thick hair sir! So, do you want your hair coloured? Hair cut! Hair cut it seems! I wish I get more customers like you! You will love this one for sure. Wow! Your right profile looks better! How come you’re so early today.. Don't praise me for such small things. Who kept the towel on the books here? Here, come take care of him. What's there to take care of? You know what day today is? The due date to pay the interest. I wonder why the debt isn’t reducing despite paying every month for the past two years. What you’re paying is the interest not the principal. Anyway, should have thought this before borrowing those four lakhs. Four lakh twenty seven thousand. Exactly! Despite spending all that amount for publishing.. how many copies did you sell? Barely any. And now you stack all your books here and secretly at your home. As if this you’re running a godown for books. Now what? You want me to pay the interest. Is that all? Let’s pay tomorrow. I didn't mean to sound rude. If I had the money I would have paid it myself. I don't want us to get a bad name. I understand. Let's go and pay it off tomorrow. Okay? Okay. Take care. Don't forget. Why do you help such people? They borrow in a rush but don't repay on time. How long have you been working here? Two weeks sir. Two weeks is it? I'll throw you out in two minutes. Sir!? It's a slow day. Hi brother. Not him again. How many books of mine have you sold today? How many did u give me? 29. All of them. Wow..so I need to start printing again? I meant all of them are still here. Not even one was sold? No, see for yourself. Sir..come here first.. Tell me which book you want. Please come inside. Please come inside. We have everything you need. Take a look yourself. The person who believes in me the most.. My father, Madhusudhan Rao. He’s works as a clerk at the Registrar’s Office. (Sings the latest song.."Buttabomma") Saraswathi! Coming! My mom, Saraswathi. Housewife. Here, let me take the bags. Bring those too. Hello there! You dropped the sugar packet here. He is only helping us because it’s sugar. Had it been cashews, he would pick it up and run! Don’t answer his questions. How are you doing Mr. Gurunadham ? I'm doing fine. Madhusudhan Rao Do you need to do all these chores at this age? You have a son. Why don't you get him to do the chores? I have a girl. I can't avoid these chores even if I want to. One more thing, I'm curious to know What does your son do? I knew he’d ask! He has a job. And what job would that be? He works at the State library near Bandar road. And salary? 12500/- A mere 12500/- ? His increment is due. Is that even a salary? I’m surprised people are still working for such small amounts What do you say Madhusudhan Rao? Don’t laugh too much. We can't bear to see those shining teeth of yours. You know him. Let’s go inside. I’ll see you later. You seem to be busy. I'll see you around. Please keep walking! Where did he go? Be nice to him. Hello sir. Hello. Hello sir. You are late this month. My salary got delayed. Why don't you take some more and write a new book? I told you to not call me a writer in public till I become successful. Don't worry. No one's here. I’ll reduce the interest for you. Your interest does not interest us anymore. Sarcasm.. As if this book is earning us huge profits.. Okay. Let's go. Sure. See you soon. Your book. Oh, Sorry I forgot. Yes, just like the last time. Take it. It’s a good read. I have lots of these already, take it. Okay. Hey! Let’s go! See what I’ll do the next time you’re here! Had your book been a success, you would have given him autograph.. not interest. Why don’t you tell your parents about the book and the debt and let them take care of this? The success of my book will bring them pride and joy, but the failure will upset them I’m actually glad I didn’t tell them about my book. I’m waiting for you to be a great writer, So I call myself the best friend to a great writer. You can't fight time and tide when they are against you! Shut up with your lousy logic! Anyway, let’s go. No. I have some shopping to do, Wait in the shop for me, I'll be back in an hour. Bye sir! Get lost! His problem not mine. Are you next? No. You're next. You wait here. Sir! Why don’t you pass your time by reading those books over there? Hello. Hi. Hey!! How did you find this book? I heard it’s in huge demand in USA too. Everyone I know is looking for this book. There are so many here. My friends will be line up in front of this shop if they find this out. In the streets of Vijayawada.. there lives our man. Facing many obstacles.. he wrote his first book. Just like Srilakshmi in Jandhyala's movie, he rubs his stories on us His name is.. Writer Padmabhushan. A youth icon. Writer Padmabhushan. He is a sensation. Writer Padmabhushan. No room for confusion. Writer Padmabhushan. He is a celebration. Mom. I'll be busy for a few days. Don't disturb me with trivial things like lunch and dinner. I wont’ eat or drink.. till I’m done with the work Is it Chicken for lunch today? You want to eat? No..I don't The chicken smells good! Didn't you just say that you don't want to be disturbed for two days? Listen Hunger is a basic need. What can I do? Okay, go He picked a pen as a child. Perhaps drank ink instead of milk. He’s read tons of books. He rides on the vehicle of words. He feels he is the competition to all the trending writers. He is blessed by the Goddess of Knowledge "Saraswathi". He is Called.. Writer Padmabhushan. A youth icon. Writer Padmabhushan. He is a sensation. Writer Padmabhushan. No room for confusion. Writer Padmabhushan. He is a celebration. Everyone has to read his writings. He is relentless in making it happen. Lucky, his name itself is an award. Such people are a rarity. Engine needs an ignition. This man here needs recognition. He won’t let go until we show him our admiration. He is Called...... Writer Padmabhushan. A youth icon. Writer Padmabhushan. He is a sensation. Writer Padmabhushan. No room for confusion. Writer Padmabhushan. He is a celebration. How did you take this book? It doesn’t have an entry here. I didn’t. I found it in the books once I got home. Probably a mistake. Oh! So..did you give it a read? Yeah.. I did.. Is it good? My foot! There is no start or end to the book, clumsily written! Exactly. That’s what I felt too! I wonder how this book even got into our library. But still, that murder episode felt good. That's the worst of all! Why does that character have to die? The death of a character should give the story a new beginning, not the end. It has no emotions, no twists. It’s horrible and pathetic writing! Mr. Seshagiri Rao? I’m coming. Where are my books? Brother! Brother! This guy again? I don't see my books here! My job is at stake for keeping your books for sale here. The owner wants them off the shop. Not even a single copy was sold. Please try to consider... Please just take your books with you. But where are they? The books? There they are! I feel sorry for you. But please understand my situation as well. I'm sure you will become a great writer one day. I printed my photo on the book so people will recognise me as the writer. Why will they? When they don't even like the book, why will they even care for the writer? While I'm used to such insults.. earlier today, when that shopkeeper.. kept my books.. near the trash, It hurt me a lot. Is my writing really that horrible? Listen! You wrote this book because you wanted to be happy. Now this is the reason for your sorrow. Do one thing.. Stay away from books and bookstalls for some time. Take a break. Start afresh. Living in the past doesn’t heal things. Don’t cry. After all this, I have decided I’ll only write next when I can write something amazing. Until then.. (On radio) Simpletons everywhere! (on radio) Saving every penny. Come sit here. Yes! coming. Look! After all the expenses this month, we are saving 8000/- Do you think the coming months will be as good as this? You will have enough time to blush about this.. Listen. Do you know who came home today? My brother, Lokender Kumar. He came to invite us for his elder daughter's reception. But we are not on talking terms with them.. True.. But he is willing to forget the past and insisted we attend the reception without fail. He wanted to wait till you come, but I said I'll convey his invitation. Is that so? What are you thinking? I find it odd he’s come after so many years.. Are you sure we don't owe them any money? No way! We’re not the kind who’ll borrow money! Ha! Now I understand! You know why they invited us? These rich people have the habit of mingling with families that are doing well. Since we just started saving 8000/- he’s come to us. So.. You think they also know about the eighty thousand worth of gold we just bought? Of course! They always have an eye out for such big purchases. Let me go check on the milk. If only I can save two more thousand next month! Venkateswara Swamy Temple! Very well decorated! Look. Why did they invite us to the reception and not the wedding? Well off families like us go abroad for destination weddings and throw a reception back here. I just googled it last night! Hey, you can stop here. But we didn't reach yet! I know, you stop! They don't have to know that we came in an auto. How much was it? Is all this necessary? Stay Silent! You know nothing. Hmm.. Get in now! The decoration looks pretty good. What is that poor man’s food? I would have ordered from a better place! But.. Brainless! Look how they are cramming for food there! But, this is a buffet! To hell with your buffet! Sitting and Dining will be a lot better. But still.. Forget it! Look at that board. It’s in English! Wait.. Everything is a mess.. Honk. My Brother-in-law, Someone is here Of course. But don't feed them like this! Alright, go now. Escape from me. How are you all doing? We’re doing good. I was afraid you wouldn’t accept my invitation! And we were afraid that you wouldn’t send us an invitation!! Just joking! You didn’t change one bit! I have another surprise for you, let’s go. I hope you don’t make us clean the tables as a surprise! Don't worry about the tables! It’s a buffet! There’s no tables!! His jokes are worse than mine! Uncle, please, just one step. Dance with us. We are going to a rich people’s event. Don't pack the leftovers in plastic covers and get them home even if they insist. And you, don't dance or act cheap in front of everyone. Be decent and silent - like me. Rajyam Aunty? Hey! Rajyam aunty! Madhusudhan! How are you all? Is this your son? Yes, Padmabhushan! Here, help him get some ice cream. How’s everyone doing? Is your son married yet? Come closer. Is it good? Cute kid. Can't you speak in telugu? It's okay. He already knows one language more than me. Wonder where Sarika is?! Sit down! He's a good man, but with bad habits! Hey! Don't you know my cousin Suri has piles. Turn him towards the stage! Slowly! Hey aunt! I can start only if you stop. Today, I want to tell you all about an important person. As you all know My Brother-in-law Madhusudhan rao and sister Saraswathi, And I have been apart and not in talking terms for many years. I want to thank you for putting it all behind us. We were apart all these years, But we will never be apart again! My dear Brother-in-law, I announcing this only because I know you will agree. I would like to give my younger daughter Sarika's hand in marriage to your son He is none other than, Padmabhushan. No, no, no. ‘Writer’ Padmabhushan! How does he know I’m a writer? What do you say Brother-in-law? I'm more than happy! How come he never told us he’s a Writer. I always knew he was up to something great. We don’t like boasting about our son being a writer. There she is. There might be many heroines in my stories, But my life has only one..Sarika. My childhood crush. I wondered how and when we would meet again. I didn't know it would be like this. Sorry. I didn't expect dad to announce so suddenly. It must have made you very uncomfortable. My dad always talks about your book. Only after reading it did I realise, what a great Writer you are! I have known you since childhood. Maybe that's why, I started growing fond of you. Okay! That's interesting! So which part of my book do you like the most? That part where you wrote about Sandhya succeeding in life, even after losing her love. No, not that. I'm asking about what you liked in the book that ‘I’ wrote. You must have written so many! How would you remember? I write so much, I tend to forget!. I also need your autograph. I mean..okay Bindu, get me the book. Here. "Idhi Evari Katha" What's this? Did she read some other book? I’ve read this book so many times! Are they planning a marriage thinking I wrote this book? I also love the weekly content that you post in your blog. I wait for it, each and every week. I keep telling my friends about it.. Do you think he got offended by my announcement? There is a blog on my name? Who is he? And there are no contact details here to find him. From tomorrow, you’ll be famous in Vijayawada. My dad is putting an ad about your book in the front page of all the news papers. Pay your bill there. His name is writer Padmabhushan. He is today's Latest sensation! It’s all because of my financial help! Let me know if you know someone who needs help...I’ll give them a break! Look, there he is. Dad, why are you here? We can give you surprises too! We wanted to see all these people heaping praises on you. I didn't know you write so well. Sorry if I was ever rude. It' s alright. Your parents must have supported you a lot in this successful journey. I have ordered lots of copies for the library So more people can read your book. As for your next book, I'll publish it with my own money. You are a famous man now! I need to tell you something. I don't think saving even 80,000/- a month would make me this happy. What a wonder! We think such things happen only in movies. But when they happen for real, that too to the person next to us.. Its' so thrilling.. Isn't it? I mean..damn! It’s so sad what happened! Okay, so what do you plan to do next? I’ll go to the police. Police? How long will you live with these debts and struggles? Police? really? It’s time we think like humans! Now.. Didn’t you say that person in the library will pay for your next book? Take that money and write a book. This book is in your name anyway. You can write a sequel for this. One day, the original writer will come to us. Till then, let’s not worry about it! What? What you said sounds good. Let me think about it. What's there to think about? Listen, your life took a turn for the better now. You're getting married too. If you go to the police now, forget about the money and fame, you'll make a fool out of yourself. I hope you understand! So.. Listen to me and accept the situation, your life will get better, and mine will too. "He who doesn’t open the door when the opportunity knocks at it, is a fool". That’s what I’m talking about! Brother, is that you? I'm Sorry for what I did the other day, congrats on the book's success. Can you give me an autograph? Just one autograph, please, just one! Just one autograph please. Opening a book that’s not yours and signing on it, doesn’t make you it’s author. Accepting this identity, is not your destiny. This is not your story. This is not your story. Mr.Madhusudhan rao, you never told me that your son is such a big writer. Oh you know it too?! There he is! You’re a big writer isn’t it? My nephew is an aspiring writer. Can you give him an intership? I'm busy writing my sequel now. I don’t plan on hiring right now. But I'll let you know if something comes up. Wow! What an extraordinary writer. His writing is filled With deep insights of life! To have such wisdom at such a young age is extraordinary! Okay guys, move! Are you the real reason behind your son becoming a writer? No comments. I might have been a huge support for my son. That doesn't mean you intrude my privacy! When I say no comments, I mean it! Writers at work – DO NOT DISTURB! We’ll block it in advance! Yes, sure! I'm here for Mr.Padmabhushan. Come with me. And who are you again? *Blushes* My pen ran out of ink. Can you get that pen from there? This is the tenth book today! Please come. At this rate I’ll need to print more soon..let me keep this.. Someone’s here for you! I showed her the way. So where were we?.. How come you’re here? You left suddenly that day, And it made me anxious. So I wanted to meet you personally. Is that okay? I wanted to surprise my parents about me being a writer when the time is right. But your dad announced it off and shocked all of us! I'm sorry about it. Can we step out for a bit? Sure but it’s a huge library..lots of pending work.. And I'm the only person here who can do these tremendous tasks You might have to wait for an hour, is that alright? That's okay. I'll wait. Do you want some tea or coffee? No thanks. You can sit under the fan. Ok, I'll sit here. How many times should I tell you to change the ink here? Why don’t you pay attention? Mr. Baburao, look at that person. He steals the newspaper everyday! Is that true Mr. Subbarao? It’s for everyone to read. Please put it back after you read it. Thank god I caught him, what would you do without me? How can I possibly manage every single thing here? Silence! Silence! How many times should I repeat? Is this a library or a public park? You there! Why are you yelling? We all are silent. Hey, who do you think he is? He’s a famous writer! No way he is a writer. It's true! His book is right here, you can read it. He doesn't look like one at all. Like writers have it written on their face? Sit down!! Looks like I’m losing my face here. Mr. Baburao, Yeah tell me. I need to leave urgently, can you close the library? Yeah, sure! You carry on. Shall we? But you said you had lots of work.. I'll take care of it tomorrow, let's go now. Have you decided on how many episodes you will be writing in your blog? Let’s talk about it some other time. But why did you want to become a writer? Can we keep books and writing aside for some time? Please, just this one. May be because I didn’t find a good enough reason to not be a writer.. Can we go to a coffee shop and talk? Coffee shop? Glass walls, dimmed lights, and faint music. So artificial. Can we go some place fresh? Relax, I got it! Are you looking for something? An auto. Oh, you didn't get your bike? I did, but since you are here.. Can't you ride doubles? Of course, I can. But it’s my first time with a girl and you will be sitting on one side so the balance might be off and if someone sees that.. Ok.. let’s take the auto.. No! We are taking the bike! Why would I miss this chance!! Unlock your phone and give it to me. This is why I left it at home. This is the first time I am seeing these things outside of films. It’s pleasant, isn’t it? It all gets dry during summer. The rains will bring back the leaves, but sweeping all the dry leaves.. from here to there would be such a task, even for two or three people.. But why are you telling me all this? What else can I do? We met suddenly and we’re in a park, all this is new for me. And I can’t think of what to say. Ask me something. Generally.. Do you like arranged marriages or love marriages? It’s all the same for me. Doesn’t make a difference for me. I like an arranged marriage. But.. It would be nice to have some lovely memories before the marriage right? You mean secretly talking on the phone, going to movies, roaming in shopping malls, Two straws in ‘one’ cool drink...things like that? Sounds really exciting, but we can’t have them as we’re getting married! Yes, even that is true. I mean, if you’re okay, we can still do that.. Did I just say that out loud?! You say yes? Yes, What’s wrong with it? Our wedding is fixed. But we still need to make some memories, don't we ? True. We need to tell our kids our cute stories. Starting tomorrow till our marriage, We are lovers. Okay? Okay.. But I have no idea what lovers do. Don't worry, there is an elder sister of mine, Nirmala I can ask her about that. She knows it. You can ask her, but don't tell her I don't know anything. She might think I'm a dimwit. Since my name is Sarika, You can call me Saari. And you are Bhushan, so you I’ll call you Bhoo.. Saari sounds good. But don’t call me Bhoo..it sounds like a cuss word. Let's go have a soda? (Voice on TV) Beware of the love trap! Mom. I’ll come home late today. Why? Why are you giggling like that? I don’t know.. But why? What? How can any son tell his mother these things? I'm coming. Be at the main gate. Now that I am here, should I just come in and say hi to your father? He might feel bad otherwise. Hey, we are sneaking out! Secretly. And dad is not home anyway. Did you tell your parents about this? Why would I?! Okay, come fast. I'll be there in two minutes. This coat was a mistake. Damn! Is that my Son-in-law? Uncle.. What are you doing here? Let’s go inside. But me and.. Your daughter and I are planning to sneak out. So you guys don’t want anyone to know about this? Yes, please don't tell anyone. I won't.. To do cute things like lovers, before your wedding? Yes..exactly! Hmm... nice jacket! Thanks, check out these stickers.. My daughter is here, Let me go hide. When I’m with you – the world around me disappears. When I’m with you, time stays still. When I’m with you – Even broad day feels like a starry night! Your laugh – is one big celebration! Your beauty fills my eyes. My heart beats for you. I’m drowned in your thoughts. Let me fill your world with my love. I wonder how lovers roam in this hot sun? Sari, have we gotten too old for all this? Of course not! All this is just new for us. You think I’m getting tanned? Your make-up’s coming off. I figured since I’m coming with you, I’ll put some... Shall we go watch a movie? Yes! There will be air conditioning too. Let me book tickets for a Boss(Chiranjeevi) movie. Oh! in that theatre on Besant road, where they play dubbed movies, right? That one’s Navarang theatre. We’re going to a multiplex, Inox! It’s the one that’s always empty, that one right? No! I’m talking about going to a new film and you talk about an empty.... So, are you OK with going to Navrang theatre? How would I know? I'm just an innocent girl. How would you know, you're just an innocent girl. Careful. I usually wear white to these dark places. Why? Even if I’m not seen, my shirt will be. Come, sit. Let’s sit right in the center. Are you enjoying yourself? I watched this with Sowmithri many times. Such a funny one. *Power shuts in theatre* Bhushan.. You know what people do in this situation? I do.. But I'm afraid you might get uncomfortable. I won't.. Then.. You shouldn't feel bad no matter what I do. Okay. I won't. Are you sure? Yes I am! Play the film you dumbhead! Kong bro was about to fight and it goes off! Are you popping corn inside? I should slap myself with my own slipper for coming here with a girl. Turn it on! Be quick slowpoke! I didn’t really cuss because you’re here. If it was just me and Sowmithri, I would have gone savage! I told you to not feel bad and now you are sulking. Were you expecting something? Chi, Get lost! O Saari, I’m very sorry, forgive me just this once. You look beautiful in a saree my love, forgive me just this once. These winds of love inside of me are turning into a storm. Thinking about our lovely time together puts a bright smile on my face. My feet just walk towards you, It all feels new. And I want to feel like this forever. Your beauty fills my eyes. My heart beats for you. I’m drowned in your thoughts. I fill your world with my love. This writer is soo good! You two should read this week's blog. There are so many twists. I myself couldn’t guess some! My headache's gone! It feels beautiful when I hear the sweet things you say. It feels beautiful when I’m around you. I let go off myself completely, yet I completely surrender myself to you. All this feels exciting and beautiful. Your beauty fills my eyes. My heart beats for you. I’m drowned in your thoughts. Why is there no new content this week? Not even this week. No content again. Something seems off. It’s been 4 weeks since content is posted on the blog. Shall we try some shape? Oh, you do shapes here too? Just joking sir. We need to talk. Come out. Is everything ok? Come out! Okay I’m coming. You, come and take care of sir. I'll be back soon. Sarika's dad came home last night. Probably for wedding planning. Correct? Uncle? Not anymore! Get up! Get out! You wanted to make a fool of us, and get married to my daughter? Listen to me! Hear me out! What? My buttons are breaking off! Bava, what happened? You prick! Careful with my hair! Bava, what happened? Did you guys find out? Why are you dragging him out like this? You are crossing your limits, what did my son do? Don't think that you can come home and create a ruckus like this.. You wanted to marry my daughter By lying to us about being a writer? I believed your son was a great writer. Little did I know his greatness came from putting his name on a book written by someone else. But what happened? What do you think? This marriage decision was a mistake, my mistake! I got a whiff when the weekly content stopped for four weeks. Thank god they are not married yet. I'm going to go to the police! Then what about the marriage.. What marriage? You still think I'll let this marriage happen? It's cancelled, cancelled, cancelled! Oh my God! How are you so calm? The marriage is called off, the police, I'm getting very nervous.. At first, I got nervous too.. But when I realized it’s a dream – I felt better! Dream? Dream...right? Why’d you slap me? To wake you from the dream. Look at the possible repercussions! What if all this really happens? You stopped me from going to the police! Should we go now instead? Now, they’ll throw me behind bars. That's true. And they’ll throw me in too for giving you this idea. We got to figure who’s doing this, and why? Why do you think he stopped the weekly content? He started using my name to write to be anonymous, but then I started using that name to be famous. That must have made him upset and angry. Which is why he probably stopped the content. And if he learns about my plan to write a sequel for his book, he might even stop my marriage from happening! We need to find him before any of this happens. We’ll have to do it very intelligently! I should have got my books and put them alongside these books. Missed it! Let's do it later. Go on! Ask for whatever you want! Do you have those coloured pins they show in movies? Yes, I do. A handful of those! Handful? Full hand! What else? A green board, white board, a globe that rotates, a wooden scale, steel scale, plastic scale, two pens, three ball pens, four ink pens, one geometry box, and some pakodas! Guess I'm feeling hungry! One brown pad, this thick, Without God stickers on it. Color papers – small ones, Two scissors, two ribbons, erasers.. Why ribbons? How would I know why? You have a calculator? We do. Does it have games? Games? Why is he asking so many questions? Just give it if you have it! I need to play games when I’m stressed. One feviquick and.. four chewing gums. We don’t have chewing gum. I told you. This guy has nothing! You got no chewing gum. Those things they give instead of loose change. The dot is right in the centre! What should I do now? What do I write on these boards? What am I looking for in these blank papers? I can’t figure anything out. Oh, he must have found the writer. You’re super talented buddy! I know it since childhood! Cut it, I didn’t crack anything. Hey you, my hair’s going into my mouth. Why are you telling me? Just spit it out. Don't you even know that? Can’t you see I’m on an important call here. Then how do they catch them in movies that easily? Because they have writers for that. Oh, I'm a writer too isn’t it? Anyway.. By the way, did you pray to Goddess Durga? You do know I don't believe in God. I trust hard work, persistence and.. Oh really?! Don't worry, that writer will go public one day and... Stop scaring me now! He’s scaring me more than that writer! I somehow have to convince Mr.Seshagiri that I can't write the sequel now. Thing is, Knowing that I’m planning to publish your book, your Father-in-law met me. Father-in-law? My Father-in-law? Yes. Him. He expressed his desire to publish it himself, and present it as a surprise in your engagement function. Oh.. And you must have nodded your head? Seeing his eagerness, I agreed. This old man messed up everything. Should we go tell your Father-in-Law that you won't be able to write the book? The weekly content has stopped, And I’m telling everyone that it’s because I'm writing this new book. Moreover, I told him I almost finished the book when I met him last. I have nothing to tell him at this time. True, he seems pretty strongly about launching your book on the day of engagement. What what’s our next step? I'm going to open up to Sarika. You can’t do it. Sarika will surely tell her father! I don't care who she tells, I got to tell her everything. Think about it again. It’s one thing to not tell the truth, But it’s wrong to lie to our loved ones, the ones who trust us. Okay, go ahead. Look.. I'm going to say this my way, don’t tease me. A small cute home.. With you and me in it.. As I leave for work, you bring me my lunch box with potato fry, Tomato rasam garnished with your smile. And you wait for me to return from work.. Doesn’t it sound beautiful? Yes. Indeed! But.. What? I'm afraid if this will ever be a reality... What are you afraid of? "Tells Sarika the whole truth" So are you not the Writer? I am ‘a’ writer, Just not for the book you have read.. You got to start with this, that you are not the Writer. Not about the tomato soup, And potato roast, beautiful house.. It’s not roast, it’s fry! Stop it! Are you feeling bad? In those two minutes you were painting our future, I pictured my entire life with you. All this to you tell me that it’s all one big lies! I mean.. I was afraid you’d leave me if you knew the truth. I cannot live without you. Writer or not, you lied to me. Knowing this, I cannot live with you. Sari, listen to me... Should I feel sad for Sarika leaving me? Or should I be scared of her dad knowing the truth? Or should I find the writer? I need to find the writer. But how? Mom.. Can you make me some coffee? Okay. Have you prayed to our Goddess Durga? Will you help me? I can't find any clues. I once visited your temple when I was a child. Here, take it.. Thanks. Look how dusty it is here.. Is this the blog where you post your writings? What is this? All these days you put some wrong number because you wanted to be anonymous. But now that all of us know, why don't you post your own phone number here? Anyway, I'll let you know when lunch is ready. Sowmithri was insisting to not open the stationery seals, Now I used everything here, Who buys four sharpeners for one pencil? Why does a white board even need an eraser? Anyway .. How dare he taunts me by posting his phone number? Hang on, why am I talking to myself instead of calling him? Let me call him first, It’s chaos now, and he is in the middle of it. what created these tickly twists? Staring at the roof and hoping for a miracle cannot solve this mystery. Look where you ended up listening to bad advice. Don’t give up yet, the twists have just begun. Let’s see who he is.. I sent our BSNL Babji the number and he sent me this address. It’s in Kakinada. I would have come with you if not for the work I have here. It's fine, I'll track him down. I know you will! Rising petrol prices raising concerns.. Oh my God! Why did they come now? Oh!! Bava is that you! Come inside Annayya. What a pleasant surprise! Come in, sit down. Thank you I would have made something for you, if I knew. Dad wanted to speak to Bhushan. How are things with you? All good! Did she tell her dad? Is Bhushan home? Yes he is, let me call him. Bhushan! Come fast!! Hi Uncle. What happened.. The weekly content has stopped. Uncle..actually.. There’s been no content since 3-4 weeks. Soo.. well.. .. You there, are you getting anything for us? She needs a reminder! Okay. So my friends follow the blog. And they were asking me why the content stopped. I told them that you were busy writing the new book. Thank God she didn't tell! I always wanted to ask, Why are you so crazy.., sorry passionate about writing? Oh, that’s a good question., Back in those days.. My father.. Late Rajender kumar. Yes, Mr. Rajender kumar He was a celebrated writer. He hoped I’d be a writer too, but I cannot write for my life! Still, to please him, I took a book written by someone else and told him I wrote it. But.. But isn’t that fraud? It is.. I was young! Barely knew anything. While my son here, became a great writer at such a young age! Let it go dad. Looks like you all are having a pretty good time! I need to talk, step out. Here.. I’ll be right back. Do you plan on standing like a statue or are you going to say something? Had lunch? Shut up! Is this all you have to say? Sari, I'm scared... Oh what?! You, and scared? Is the great mastermind behind this scam scared of me? This sarcasm of yours is what scares me. Come here! Closer. Sit. I want to punch you for what you did. But.. I realised I can't live without you. I knew you would understand me, no matter when I tell you. You thought you can leave me after loving me so deeply?! Off, off with the hand! Calm down! He's so funny! Dear, let’s go. I'm leaving to Kakinada tonight to catch that writer. Ask him where he is going. Quiet! You know what.. These great writers have something called a ‘writer’s spot’. Which is why Puri jagannath goes to Bangkok and director Vamsi went to Godavari river banks, When they go to that spot, they get new ideas! So don’t ask him anything, give him whatever he needs. Okay Dad I'm.. All the best! But I am.. Don't tell me anything! All the best! Okay then, I'm leaving. Hey... I wish you some good ideas! Sowmithri, send him off safe. Sure aunty. Collect the change later. Hey conductor! I didn't take the ticket yet! What if you throw me out later for not having a ticket!? She bought your ticket. Who? Sari!! Is that you? You are the definition of true love! You never leave my side. I thought you were too angry to come. Even Sowmithri couldn't make it, I was worried I needed to do this by myself. Thanks for coming! Stop pretending as if nothing happened. I'm still mad at you! Don’t pinch so hard! I know how to calm you down. Here’s the book I’ve written. Read this, and you won’t be angry anymore! What are you doing! Last available copy! Why are you so pissed? Just tell me what you want me to do. Nothing. Shut up and sit. Oh my.... I get sleepy as soon as I get into a bus. Enough of your antics! Now I know... You are ‘hangry’ aren't you? Should I get some chips at the next stop? They have baked ones too.... How about fruits? Peanuts, corn? We don’t have to get down. The hawkers come to the windows! Looks like there’s a wedding happening. I hope it’s not the writer’s wedding! So this is where the writer fellow is! Fellow? Don’t you have any respect? Like your respect for me? As if you are a writer! Of course! I mean.. not of this book of course! But listen, how do we know who he is? Don't stress. I might not know him, but he knows me. So whoever over-reacts on seeing me, is our target. Shocked at my sharp mind? I know I am too smart for this world! Yea, and I’m just wondering where your sharpness was, when you were looking everywhere but the blog for his number. Well, that’s the catch! All great creative people tend to miss some details. As a creative writer.. Why do you run away every time I call myself a writer? Actually, I’m also a little nervous. Hey ther..... Don’t disturb me. We need to greet our guests, at least for formality.. Do you know Kanna? Kanna? Kanna! Where’s the silk saree? Let go Bhushan! Why? So you can write another book and put my dad’s picture on it? I said let me go!! Why did you write the book and the blog? and why did you stop? Do you know the trouble you got me into? Let go of me! "Priest Chants" People are watching. "Priest Chants" It’s my first time meeting a great original writer! That part where you wrote about Sandhya succeeding in life even after losing her love is excellent! Oh.. So you did read that book, okay, actually.. One minute.. You are the writer right? Yes. Original writer! For which book? The one she’s talking about. Which was the one she talked about? You need to ask her that, not me. Sari, weren’t you talking about "Idhi Evari Kadha"? Yeah. Then why do you sound as if you know nothing about the book? Even you knew I’ve written the book just now isn’t it? Yes, we knew it a few moments ago. True, she even told us the name of the book. It’s all fuzzy to me. But I want to know why... You want to know why I did all this. Yes!! Here at home, they don’t even allow a girl to go out to the street by herself. We are an orthodox family, If stepping out of the house is such a big deal.. You think my family would be OK with me writing a book or a blog? Understandable... I’m stuck between these walls, but I always dreamt of being a great writer and hear accolades for my work! Oh, I have similar dreams too! You could’ve use a friend’s or a random name if you wanted to be anonymous. Why me? I didn’t want to disrespect my work by putting a random name. I looked for an upcoming writer. Someone who aspires of being a great writer, but can never be one! I figured it would help that person too....that’s when I found you. What? Will you write please! What? For our wedding. Will you write? I don’t understand. For us to get married, you.. My father believes he’s a successful writer and wants to launch his next book on the day of our engagement. If the book isn’t ready by then, he might call the engagement off! I can’t write a book right now. Kanna, please understand. How can I write when it's my sister’s wedding? Thanks God it's her sister's wedding. Had it been her wedding, our wedding would be in trouble. I’m glad least your son is here...okay I'll call you later. Mom! Meet my friends. Namaste aunty! Why didn’t you come for the wedding yesterday? We were busy with work.... True, I also have a book to finish. She’s well that library is my profession and writing is my passion, but she insisted I come for the pooja at least. So I made it for her, sorry her, happy? Thanks for coming! Kanna, Show them their room. Sure. You think they’ll give us both one room? "Priest conducting pooja" What? Look there! "Priest conducting pooja" Not like I can’t write, But you are the best writer I know. Kanna... Write this book for your own sake! Let me give your talent wings! If you don't write, we won’t get married. If that happens, I’ll somehow take it, but not Sari.. She’s weak. She might go mad, she might even kill herself, Are you angry I’m doing nothing with you despite being alone in a closed room? We are here with an agenda. Also, can’t you wait till the wedding? Get lost! I wish they gave us separate rooms, I’d have practised in peace. I'll give your talent wings! Kanna, please write, I am a big....you are a great.... Please write! Kanna.... Can we talk please? What now? Have you come to convince me now? Please make Bhushan understand, that I can’t write. Bhushan might not be a good writer. But he is a good person. He is kind and selfless, Helps those in need. Even when he learnt about your book, I could sense he was in fear. When I knew the truth, I wanted to break up with him, but I couldn’t. A person who can’t do wrong without fear, is in my opinion, a good person! If you write this book, you will make our marriage happen. First point is "you’re the best" Second is sarika going mad, third is me giving you wings to fly across the state. okay let's go! Where do I start? Not like I can’t write, But you are the best writer I know. Bhushan, I spoke to her. Stay calm, don’t mess it up. But I’ve been practicing my speech since morning! The issue here is not about convincing me. My parents are planning on sending me to the USA along with my sister. So you are leaving us for the USA? I’d rather leave the house! Then come along. With us to Vijayawada. Are you kidding me? Our wedding... Okay, but you need to take me out of this place! Done! We booked a women’s hostel for you. We’ll drop you off and head home. I’m going to stay home with you guys. That's not possible. You can't stay in his house. I’m staying at Bhushan’s, and I’m going to write, that’s final! How can you.... It’s okay. I can now supervise and get it written to my liking! Let's go to my house. You are so... Careful there! Make sure they are spotless. Okay uncle That one There he is... How are you dear? Hi uncle! So, is that anna? Not anna, Kanna Did you tell my dad about her? Why would I? Is she your friend? No uncle, she is Bhushan's friend Damn!! Hello! I met her on the trip, She’s a fan of my writing wanted to join as an assistant. I was hesitant at first, But I wanted you to take the final call She looks like a good girl Being your assistant would help her too! What’s her name? Kanna. Dear... I've told my son to hire you. Now tell me, did you get any plot points? Did you eat anything? That is a mother. That’s what you ask the first thing. Thanks amma Let's go. Okay aunty, My cab is waiting... See you later! I'll come back! Bye all! You think he’s got any new points? Happy morning :) Shut the alarm! In search of something more,You lost what you have, How can one stoop lower than this? Oh! Careful! Thank you! Let me do it. I’ll do it. It’s okay, I ca... Aunty... I’m going to stay here for a few days. Once you lived like the King Now you're handed a beggar's plate Guess whose mistake is that! Anything you need – let me know. I'm right here. I love what Kanna is wearing! But it’ll look way better on you!! Too much respect you’re giving here. Stop over acting. It’s not like that, It’s here writing that inspires me. I respect her writing, not her per se. I understand, but.... Hey! You need something? What? You raised your hand.... Okay. I told you not to look at me like that. You look prettier when angry. Listen! Ensure there’s a twist once every 10 pages, Also, don't stick to one plot, go wild! Keep dropping surprises every now and then, like my father-in-law. Why didn’t you do these in the book you wrote? Bhushan Slurping Putting aside your shame, Turned you speechless today, PadmaBhushan! Mumbling to self Bhushan, what? I was thinking, would you be able to finish the book by the engagement date? Only if you don’t disturb me like this now! I know.. I’m just blabbering... As if I'm going to write it.. I think I need to leave.. Can I see what you are writing? Not until it's finished. Can I at least see the first page? Here, write it yourself! It’s okay, you continue.. He just doesn't stop... If I could write, why would I bring her along? Despite all the hardships, you try to put up a straight face But deep down you're shaken This guy.... What? My father’s getting suspicious that I’m not writing. As a creative person, I want to give it a shot! You must be getting bored, why don't you go home and leave us writers alone! What? What are you listening to? Why do you care? You keep writing... I’m not able to... Why? No idea. Give me one... Give it! You like this song? I do too! Why don't you go inside and leave us lovebirds alone! You can't even sit and write for 5 minutes. Are you even a writer? Did you hear what she said? Sounds like truth to me. Keep it to yourself. This is an insult, to my face! So rude!! His name is... Oh my.... His name is... Oh my.... No, no, no, no...... Shit! I knew it! Entire week of suspense is wasted! Both director and the writer seem to be idiots! Why are you blaming the writer? Who knows what he’s going through! It’s always the writers that get blamed. Why are you crying? It's the onions. One who writes moral stories, Turned a fraud And is down on his feet now Sari... Sari... Are you asleep? Not yet. The thing is... So... Tell me! Where’s her book? What?? The Book! You are such a...! This is exactly how your father grabbed me! When? In my dream. You!! I thought you were asleep Goodnight! Get lost! Goodnight! Have you gone crazy? Why are you laughing like that? I can't stop it! Get out! Shut the door. I knew I’d get caught! Hey! The engagement and book launch date is closing in! As a father, I’ll be asked to give a speech. So I wrote this down. Tell me what you think. Stop it, pay attention to me. Today... The reason I’m standing here, in front of you all is My son Writer Padmabhushan Since childhood, I’ve always believed in him! Not just for him – this is a big moment for our family! To be a good writer.... To write a good book... Writing isn’t enough – it needs a lot of encouragement. Encouragement... I don’t find words like this easily. Every father must encourage his son.. Anyway, you carry on with your work. I’m going to go practice this. Madhusudhan practicing his speech Puri was fine but Paneer tikka was bland.... Oh, you guys are finally home! What’s up uncle? Had your dinner? Yeah!! We’ve been to all those places before. Sari, could you take a picture? Here... Just a second.. Look at this book! What's happening? Why did you stop? Your dad’s checking the book? Dad, how did my assistant write? How’s my training? There’s nothing here. Just random scribbling.... Here, look. Is it my book he’s seeing? Is this what you’ve been doing all this time? Do you think my son.... Let it go please. How can I let it go? He hired her because I told him to, and look what she does. Okay, calm down. But you told you were a writer? Did I say it? Why did you write the book and the blog? and why did you stop? You are the writer right, for which book? The one that she’s talking about. Which was the one she talked about? You need to ask her that, not me. But then, when we met first.... Sari, forget it. It's not her. I’m the one who told her everything. What are they talking about? Something about hints and writer? What happened to your orthodox family, restrictions, and going to the USA with your sister? Would I come here and stay with you if my family was orthodox? How do you not get it? He is trying to squeeze information out of her, let's go in. Look at you, not a gram of guilt! I just didn’t want to go to the USA. So I took advantage of your situation and lied to you. All these days, I believed your lies. And now, I can’t even believe your truth. Just tell me this – are you even a writer? No, I’m not. Then why are you still here? Get out! Calm down Bhushan! Don't you get it? The book needs to be finished before the engagement. And she’s not even the writer. Bhushan!! She says hasn’t written it. I haven’t written it either. So who’s the writer? Bhushan!!! What??? I’d like to know the truth. Can you please tell me? So what happened is... We wanted to come clean about everything and convince everyone after the marriage. Bhushan felt the same.. Dad, let me explain .... Please don’t speak. I need some time to process all this. Perhaps because I’ve never ever scolded him, I’m unable to find words even when I want to scold him. Sorry Bhushan.... Go inside please. I'm sorry for everything.... Let's talk later, go in now. You got to be stronger. Imagine how embarrassed and upset he must be. I’m a father after all! I feel like boasting my son’s achievements But to learn that all this is one big lie – is tough for me to digest. Don’t conclude based on today’s events. The truth could be different. Who knows, maybe, today’s lies might become tomorrow’s reality! That's true. Why do we have to be sad? Worst case – we’ll be where we were, which is still a great life! We save 8000/- every month! That's more than enough! The number you are calling is currently switched off, please try again later! Sarika, tell me. Kanna, are you at Bhushan’s home? Yes I’m still here. Everything alright? How’s uncle? He's OK! I’m trying to reach Bhushan. Is he around? Bhushan and Sowmithri went looking for a new writer. Bhushan and Sowmithri went looking for a new writer. ‘Another’ writer? Yes, someone needs to write and finish the book right? Hi Bhushan, welcome! So I was thinking.. We’ll do the engagement in your library. It's fitting to launch your book in your library, isn't it? As you wish uncle! Where’s Sarika? She's on the terrace. Here you are! I was with our dad. You’re not picking my calls, is something wrong? You seem dull? I understand - you’re stressed that the engagement is coming closer, and that I haven’t finish the book. Don’t worry. Sowmithri has hired another writer already! He’ll finish the book in a week. You have nothing to worry. Oh, so you found ‘another’ writer now? How are you so casual about it? He is a very senior writer.. And if he can’t write well, you’ll find another one! Correct? I didn't mean to... Bhushan, You can’t cross every hurdle in life by seeking help. You need to remind yourself you are a writer too! But I'm doing all this only for us. You are only worried about losing me or our marriage, But you have to realize you’re losing yourself and your identity. Not too long along, when someone read your book – it’d make you happy. If someone criticised – you’d be upset. But you had a fire inside you. But now, it’s disappointing to see you like this. I fell in love with that Bhushan, not this one. You decide – who you want to be. Back then, I was also in pursuit of the writer. But once your father learnt the truth – I hoped you would change. " Not realizing your inner potential is ever more foolish" "Not realizing your inner potential is ever more foolish" Look inside of you – listen to your heart – and you will realize what you’re missing. How long.. will you be deaf to your dreams? How long.. will you stall your progress? How long.. will you be lost in false praises? How long.. will you keep struggling within yourself? Living in darkness. will never enlighten you. No help will come when you drown in sorrow. Never accept failure, you only have one chance. To rewrite your story. Write it yourself. [Beep] Bhushan.. The first book you wrote, not many people have read it anyway, how about re-publishing it for your engagement? Dad, I’ll take care of it.. Anyway If need be, I’ll plead your father-in-law to forgive us for whatever happened. You are surrounded by many untold stories. You can write too! And be great one day. You will be known. You will win. No one’s going to do it for you. You will find your victory When you work for it. so stop looking for help, Never accept failure, you only have one chance. To rewrite your story, write it yourself. All of you have immense faith in me, But me. You have been extremely supportive throughout. My parents, though sad, aren’t showing it as they’re afraid it’ll upset me. and my friend sowmithri, is giving a 50% discount in his salon Just so more people come and read my book. Everyone has faith in me Is it only me who doesn’t believe in myself anymore? Am I even trying? Or am I just scared of failing? I’m lost. Please don’t cry Bhushan. But I can’t stop it. Believe in yourself, and the world will too. What you think, You become. No matter how small your step, It takes you closer to your goal. Your passion will make you achieve your dreams. Never accept failure, you have only one chance. To rewrite your story, write it yourself. Bhushan... Aren’t you ready yet? Your parents have left to the venue already. I’ve got a car ready for you, you better start soon. Hey Yes? Please have this book wrapped. You want a nice reveal at the book launch? I’ll get it done. One more thing, What? make sure no one opens it Sure Not even you! So Bhushan works for you? Yes, I was the main guy in promoting Bhushan's book You might be the main guy, but I’m the money guy! Saraswathi, Is your son on the way? Yes. Why that look? tell me.. Did you open the book? You wrote the book, but instead of your photo, you put that.. So, Is this the writer we’ve been looking for all this while? I’ll take care of it, he is here! You’re not scolding me here, in front of everyone. Let’s talk once we get home. Whatever! Congratulations, you’re getting engaged! Smile, Be happy! It’s your day! That’s a nice shirt. Just tuck it properly! Thanks. You don’t have to thank me for this. The thanks isn’t for this. He’s here, Let’s get on to the dais! and start the event, Sit here. Bhushan, We’ll do the engagement first and the book launch after? As you wish uncle. Okay. Hang on, Let’s launch the book first, and do the engagement later. Bhushan, who do we call to unveil the book? His mother?! Not her, I want my father to do it. Dear brother-in-law, I request your gracious presence on the dais to unveil the book! I’ll do it this one time, and I’ll ensure you do it the next time! Hey sowmithri, please bring the book. Here. What? What’s this? Why is your mother’s picture here? Bhushan, what are you doing? Can you please help me here? Hey, be careful! "Idhi evari kadha"? This doesn’t look like my handwriting either? and this address.. Why is your name here? It even has your address. Tell me, what’s all this? (Flashback) Saraswathi aunty and my mother are friends since childhood. What? So your son hasn’t told you he wrote a book? Then how did you know? When I even know what’s in his heart.. Won’t I know what’s in his room? He might have his own reasons not to tell us, Perhaps he wanted to tell us once he becomes successful. So I figured why can’t I help him with his success! If my writing can help him, I’ll be the happiest. So I decided.. To write a book in his name. You are being silly, We had many dreams during childhood.. That I wanted to be a doctor and you, a writer.. and then, we got married. And that was it! We all thought you’d be a big writer one day, But did you? We all dream, it’s easy, But achieving those dreams, isn’t for everyone. Mummy, It's you who’s sounding silly. What you’re saying sounds depressing... You make it sound like marriage is the end of everything. That there’s nothing a woman can do after getting married. I’m starting to worry about my future now! Not just worried, but scared! That’s not what I... Hang on! Aunty, I understand what you’re trying to do here. I’ll help you. Let's publish a book in our printing press, along with that, Let’s create a blog and publish weekly content. It’ll give us a wider reach. Are you happy? You’re a writer but you couldn’t tell anyone. Seeing you in that state, purely to encourage you, Your mom has written a book in your name. Mom, I'm very hungry, can I get something to eat? Okay Mom. Mom! Be right there! His writing is filled with deep insights into life! To gain so much wisdom at such a young age is remarkable. Why are you smiling? I remembered a joke. Bye. But you, Took the encouragement for granted. Knowing that you failed, aunty wanted to give you the courage.. and confidence to keep on writing. Hence, she wrote a book in your name. You stooped down to a level where you’re now looking for someone else to write on your name. We only did this to make you realise what you were doing. Here, eat this. But I didn’t ask you. You don’t have to, I know what you need. Until now, I have earned a name, With my mother’s writing. and now, I wrote this book. So I put her name on it. To make up to her. All this while, I was in search of who’s story this is, Only to realise, That it’s mother's story – my mother’s story! That’s her place. This is where she wanted to be! But we never gave her that chance. Listen, look at me, I did all this, only so you learn, My intention wasn’t to hurt you. If I told you what to do, You might change – but you won’t progress. Only when you learn by experience, Will you be a better person. Also, I have my own selfish reason to do all this. What makes me happier than being called ‘Writer’ Saraswathi is, Being called ‘Mother of’ Writer Padmabhushan. You wanted people to know that you wrote a book And I wanted them to know that I just want to write! Our paths might be the same, But I was scared that like me, you would also end up like a nobody. But why did you never tell us you wanted to write? No one asked me. Oh, yes. Someone did ask, When I was young, in school, My Telugu teacher had asked me. Subramanyam, what do you want to be when you grow up? Teacher, I want to be a politician. Saraswathi? I want to be a writer, I enjoy writing stories! I thought you could become a writer if you wrote well. Little did I know it would all change, once I got married. Everyone asks a boy who’s growing up – what he wants to do in his life. But to a girl, they only ask when she wants to get married. I started to get scared, That my wings of education, Will be clipped by the walls of the kitchen. People often ask why girls need to be educated.. Are they right? Don’t we really need it? Today, the reason, I’m standing here, in front of you all is my son.. ...No My Wife.. To announce she is a writer, makes me proud. Since childhood, I’ve always believed in him.. Right from the day we got married, I knew she was talented. Not just for her – this is a victory.. For our family. Our entire family. And, To be a good writer... To be a good writer.. In order to become a good writer, Writing isn’t enough, It needs, a lot of encouragement.. Need to..encourage. I, never asked you what you liked or what you wanted to be in life. I am sorry for that. And for doing so much for us even without having to ask, Thank you! My wife.. Saraswathi.. ‘Writer’ Saraswathi! ‘Writer’ Saraswathi This time, the girls have won!! Don’t feel bad, dad. Not just you.. You, me probably everyone else is the same. Even I’ve been like this all this while. I only learnt it now. No one ever told me I need to ask my mother what she wants to be, or do. Who would tell? None of us were told. Every girl in our family wants to be something, has some dream. And leave alone encouraging them, We don’t even care to know what it is. We tag them a ‘Housewife’ and seal their dreams. Just go ask the women in your house what they want to be, You’ll realise there’s no connection between what they are and where they want to be. Can we all ask them, once? To everyone rooting for their mothers' success, and for the success of women in their family, This book is a gift.. Mom! and for the success of women in their family, What are you thinking? It’s just that, I want to call my wife and ask her what she wants to be, but I’m feeling ashamed. What do you want to be in life? We need to be ashamed for not asking them all these years. Not now. Just make the call! You sure? Of course! Just do it! Okay! Sari, tell me what you want to do right now, I don’t want to get in trouble later! Mother’s Story - The Unknown Story
