Becky. Hey. Becky! You're not going. The party's just getting started. I'm meeting someone. Good luck. Did you bring anything? Of course. Oh, yeah? Yeah, we'll hang out. Oi, Lincoln, you dog! Huh? Jacko! What did you say to my fiance? What? Hey. Ah! My eye. Cool. Becky! Becky! Becky! What the bloody hell are we doing out here? Just looking for anything of Becky's. Any sign. Pick up the pace, but keep your eyes peeled. We'll find her, mate. Becky! Becky! Becky! Find something, boy? Have you got something? What's going on? Found something. Yeah, well, this is getting bigger by the minute. Well, I'm going to need some help. This is Mingara, mate. OK. Thanks. Matt! Matt! It's not her. What? It's not her. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Shh, it's not her. Well, it's like you say, John. If you say it with confidence, you can convince anyone of anything. We really appreciate it. You're welcome. See you, guys. Lachlan. Eve. You look great. Skirt suits. Thanks. So you don't miss being in the field? If this is about Mingara, the answer's no. This case needs you. Oh. Well, I don't need it. You know, there's no PTSD in policy-making. We always said that the bureaucracy was worse than the bodies. That was a lot of bodies ago. We'd be running the investigation together, Eve. Equal footing. And when has that ever worked? We can make it work. There are other detectives. But they're not you. Good luck with it. Five bodies, Eve. Serial killer. I've done my time with murderers and... Their Achilles tendons have been cut. To stop them running away. You'll find a good team. Rebecca Ryan's still missing. I think she could still be alive. Oh, just great. Matt Davis. We spoke on the phone. Lachlan McKenzie. This is Eve. Eve Winter. I know. Legend. Thanks for coming. Dan Wild, Bridget Anderson. Dan, how are you? Bridget. We've had the air wing doing aerial search. Dog squad on the ground. Everything we can think of. No sign of Becky. Do you know her personally? She's friends with my son Mikey. I played poker with her dad. Good people. Any chance she's run away? Absolutely not. Her family's not like that. Is anyone compiling these? Trying to. We're a bit stretched. Matt, what's your gut feeling? Has Rebecca been taken by the killer? I pray to God no. Five bodies, none of them Becky. Any identification? No. No wallets or bags and the bodies are so badly decomposed there's no obvious identifying marks. We might not have any formal identification for days. But you've matched two to missing person cases. Yeah. Cynthia Lewis, 22 from Brisbane and Jasmine Kyte, 21 from Victoria. That's a long way apart. Killer could be a traveller. A truck driver maybe. Mmm. Both went missing in November. Jasmine last year and Cynthia the year before. It's November now. That would make Becky number six, right? All the terminals have internet access and we've got some more whiteboards coming. Where are these guys all from? Some from Mingara, some from the surrounding area. Any of them know the victims? No, they don't. Oh. Um, Becky's parents gave us some of her things. They thought that might help. Thanks. Do you have a map of the town? Yeah. Um, Marsh, can you put the map up of the town centre? Bridget? Yes. I want all the evidence on Becky's disappearance front and centre. Sure. And we've got some DNA tests coming. Right. We need to track back what we know of Becky's route home on Saturday night. Um, she turned left up... Excuse me. Oh, sorry. Sorry. You can't come in here, actually. Please, can I just have a moment? My daughter went missing from Gosford two years ago. I need to know. Is she one of the dead girls? I have this photo. This is her. Her name's Amanda Hughes. She was on her way to a school reunion in Bathurst. I put her on the bus myself. Her friends were waiting for her at the other end but she... ..she never arrived. Thanks, Bridget. The police say she must have got off somewhere, but why would she? She couldn't wait for that reunion. I know my girl. This silver cross. Would she have been wearing it? It's a present from her grandfather. She never took it off. Have you...? Have you found...? None of the victims were wearing jewellery of any kind. What do we think? Is it possible she could be one of the victims? Right age, right look. Disappeared in November. Would she willingly get in a car with a stranger, though? No. Yes. Look at the photo. Exactly. Conservative dress. No hair dye, no crazy make-up. She still signs her name with a smiley face. But look at the smile. She's flirting. Like her mother did with you. She calls herself Mandy. It's a little more risque. The right man, if he was handsome and he said the right things. She'd go with him. Yeah, well, we still don't know for sure if she's one of the bodies, though. No. But she's not alive. Her bank accounts haven't been touched. There's that. And a year without contact? It takes a very specific personality type to punish like that. Amanda, Mandy... She wouldn't do it. No. So we're most interested in the last five people we know that saw Becky that night. OK. We know she left the party just before midnight. By the time she got here, the pub was closing. Now, Lincoln De Luca, 25, works at the stock and rural. He runs into Darren McKecnie. Lincoln tells Darren that the pub is closing so they decide to go back to Lincoln's place for a couple of beers. Only Jackson Ciesolka punched him in the nose. Does anyone know why? But Jackson is bad news. It's got to be over a girl, right? You had Mr Ciesolka down as a person of interest. Oh, a couple of assault arrests, plus he had some trouble as a teenager. Snow dropping, perving, that kind of thing. Ray Stafford? Look, Ray's a bit of a mystery. He won't even admit to being in town on Saturday night, but both Lincoln and Darren swear they saw him. What about Damian Jefferies? Well, he ticks all the boxes. He's an out-of-towner. Only been here for a year. Was seen talking to her. He has a vehicle, so he could've taken her anywhere. And he knows her. Knows how? Works in her parents' bakery. Jacinta. How you going? Kev. How are ya? This is Detective Lachlan McKenzie and Detective Eve Winter from Sydney. They're here to help us with the search for Becky. Go inside? I'll see you back at the station. How's it going, mate? Mate, I've had better days. Look, Becky's never done anything like this before. We thought she was getting a lift home. She's got a key. I'll bloody kill her when I see her. What does Becky like to do in her spare time? Does she have any hobbies? Sports? Facebook? We decided to keep the girls away from Facebook with everything... You hear stuff. On the news. Kids... ..sexting. We just thought we'd keep her safe from all that. What about boys? Becky doesn't have a boyfriend. Well, she's... friends with a few boys from school, but she's not dating any of them. Chloe. Say hello. Hello. If you can think of anything else, we're staying at the Commercial. Oi. You're here to find Becky, aren't ya? Yes. Not because of what's going on with all them other ones and... We're here to find Becky. You're good. You practising for something special? The eisteddfod. It's tonight. Does Becky dance? When she was my age. But she stopped. Do you know why? The kid seems wound up. She's eight. Her world's falling apart. In there. She can't understand what's happening. It's too huge a concept. Becky? 15, pretty, walking home by herself. I might not know it, but I guarantee there's a boy involved. Yep. See ya. We're looking for Jackson Ciesolka. We believe he's doing a job for you. We don't want to scapegoat anyone. We just want to find Becky. Alive. If we don't know who took her, how's a bunch of strangers from the city gonna work it out? So you think it's a local? I didn't say that. He's out the back. Thank you. Look, I don't know where Rebecca is. I didn't see her on the night and I haven't seen her since. I barely know her. Most people with nothing to hide tend to answer questions simply. "No, it wasn't me. No, I wasn't there." Why are you so aggressive? Just over it. Oh, for God's sake. It was 10 years ago. I did it once. I was a kid. You're gonna pull me up for that, are ya? Alright, so what do you think happened to Becky? Serial killer. Someone local? No way, mate. Someone like that in this town? You'd know it. Put the tomahawk down, Jackson. Thank you. Did you see Becky that night? Yes. I was waiting outside the pub for Lincoln and I saw her walking by and that's it. Why'd you hit Lincoln? Sweetheart. Uh... This is my fiancee, Stacey. Stacey, task force coppers. We should get going. Yeah, I'll finish up and meet you in the car, alright? So... ..the hit. I don't know. I was just pissed, mate. Just one of those nights. Excuse me. I'll be in touch. Yeah, sure. I've seen Becky. Stopped for a chat. She's a mate. She comes in here sometimes after school. Well, it was midnight. She was heading home. You didn't offer her a lift. She said she wanted to walk. It was cooler. Did you see anyone else in Main Street when you drove off? No. Just Becky in my rear-view mirror. She, um... She turned the corner and she was gone. If I had driven her home, maybe none of this would have happened. What do you think happened to Becky? At first, I thought she went off with a mate. Took a trip to Dubbo and then... ..then Sunday came, then Monday. Do you think she's alive? Do you? Yap, yap, yap. If that dumb tart calls here one more time, I am telling you I am walking. That is it. You can take care of yourself, you and your boy, alright? Go, then! Last chance! Oh, get out of here! Mrs Stafford. Not for much longer. We'd like to talk to you and your husband. Yeah, well, I've got to go to work. Sorry. I've already told Matty everything I know. Which is nothing. You sure you don't want one? Working. Yeah, me too. Not for a couple of hours, but. Train driver, right? Yeah. It's only freight. To Bourke. Nothing for me to do once it gets going. Sounds like you've got it sussed. Actually, I might go a coldie, thanks, Ray. When did you pull the gearbox out of your car? Last week. Always takes longer than you think. So, Ray, did you see Becky the night she disappeared? It's alright. We just crosschecking timelines. It's not a biggie. Cheers. Yeah. I seen her. You didn't say that before in your statement. I didn't want to get involved. Why not? Becky's a local girl. Not interested in finding her? Nothing I've seen is gonna find her. So what did you see, Ray? Just for timelines, right? Yeah. I seen her walking up the street just as Damian Jefferies drives past in his ute. He stops, turns around, goes to talk to her. She leans in the window all friendly. Friendly? Could you hear what they were saying? Nah. But I know when a lady's interested. Then what did you do? I went home. That's it. I've got nothing more for youse. Did you drive? Yeah. No traffic cops after 12. Your car or your wife's? My car. Hard to drive a car without the gearbox in it. Fuck off! Here you go, Ray. You can have mine. God, it's so stuffy. I've given you the right-hand side of the wardrobe and I'm taking the bed by the window. Why pick a local girl? Why now? Opportunity. When he saw Becky walking home, it was easy. If he hadn't have taken Becky, the others might never have been discovered. Well, he got sloppy. Even serial killers make mistakes. Half our suspects are here. Ciesolka, De Luca, McKecnie. They're never gonna give up one of their own. They wouldn't protect a serial killer. Maybe not. They might not recognise him for what he is. I just spoke to the pathologist. He said there's evidence of violent sexual penetration... Sorry. Evidence of violent sexual penetration on two most recent bodies. And it's difficult to prove categorically, but it's possible the killer starved his victims to death. Well, it takes three weeks to die of starvation. Three days, if you don't have any water. How you doing, mate? Hey, Brett, how you going? Hey, young fella. Ciesolka. Hey, mate. Anything new? No, no, I was just seeing that everyone was up for the poker game on Friday night. Mikey, right? Yeah, this is my son. What happened to your eye? Camping accident. His stupid mate Bruno poked him in the eye with a tent pole. I'll see ya later. Let's get back to the hall. Leave you two to it. Hey, baby, how you doing? OK, imagine you're Becky. Start walking towards the camera. She's alright. Try laughing. What am I laughing about? I don't know. Imagine someone has told you a joke. Hilarious. Back to position number one. He's gotta be here somewhere. Nice legs! Come on. Come over this way. We'll shout you a beer. I used to love watching you do that. You're not allowed to say that. Why not? You're married. Not anymore. I got a divorce six months ago. Oh. Kids went with her. It's all very civilised. Is that why I'm on the task force? You're here because you're the best person for the job. And it never crossed your mind? Bridget, get over to Ray Stafford's now. Were the shots from inside? No, no, just a bit further down the treeline. You stay here in case they double back. Tell you what... Oh. Police! Don't move! Follow. Oh. Oh! I've missed my train. I want you to stand up. Stand up, put your hands behind your back. Come on. Don't make this difficult. Come on. I didn't do nothing! Becky! Thought someone was stealing his dope plants. Explains why Ray was so paranoid this afternoon. Who's guarding the crime scene? We just... Well, you left it unguarded. Jesus. Where the fuck were you two? What am I gonna tell her father? Huh? ♪ Out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole ♪ He rocks in the treetops all the day long ♪ Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song ♪ All the little birdies on Jaybird Street ♪ Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet ♪ Rockin' robin ♪ Tweet, tweet, tweet ♪ Rock, rock, rock, rockin' robin ♪ Tweet, tweedly dee ♪ Blow rockin' robin 'cause... ♪ Where is she? Where is she?! I'm sorry, mate. I won't have any answers until I've completed the full autopsy. We're transporting her to Newcastle now and that's far enough. We need to know anything you know. Anything at all. We won't hold you to it. I've heard that before. But in six months, it's me in the Supreme Court who's being ripped apart by the defence lawyer on contamination issues. Yeah, alright, OK. Three questions. Three. When were the Achilles tendons cut? Post-mortem. Post? Yeah. Any other differences? Apart from the cause of death? Blunt force trauma to the head. Rock, mallet, hammer. But don't hold me to that. She's been outside probably the whole three days. So she was dead before we got here? Within 24 hours of her leaving that party. Did she have sex before she died? Can't you people count? I've taken swabs but... ..it's gonna take a while to type the DNA even if there was semen present. Thank you. It's not the same pattern. Tendons were cut after she was dead. She didn't die of starvation. It's a different killer. No-one else knows about the Achilles being cut. Why would you take... It has to be the same person. Why would you take such a risk dumping the body in the open? He's playing with us. Wants to show us he's smarter than we are. Yeah, and so far he is. I know this isn't what you signed up for. I really thought we'd find her alive. This is exactly why I took a desk job. I don't want to feel like this again. We couldn't help Becky. But if we do our job now, there won't be another victim. Do it for me. Hello? Angie? Angie? Fox got 'em. Every one. Must've been a young fox. Grabs the first chicken. The others... ..go berserk. Screeching, flapping around. The fox freaks out. Just wants to stop the noise. They get better as they get older. Angie... ..you know everyone in this town. If you know anything at all, now's the time to tell us. Please. Hi, Sophie. Have you got a minute? I've got a dance class. We won't take long. Have you seen her? Becky? Her body. It's really hers? It's not a mistake? Uh, I'm sorry. Yes. I didn't believe anything had happened. Not really. Not serious. Do you know why she left the party early? What are you doing on school grounds? Uh, sorry. We're with the police. You know you need permission to be on grounds after hours. Yes, of course. We should've consulted with you first. Brian Fleet. Principal. Eve Winter. Good. Sophie, aren't you late for dance class? Sir. He's such a loser, isn't he? He's... ..slimy. Did he show a special interest in Becky? He shows a special interest in anyone in a leotard. Shows up to all our dance classes. You live next door to her. Yeah. I don't know nothing, but. Do you know why we're here, Bruno, talking to you? It's all related to a two-hour time period between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. on Saturday night. The night Becky was last seen. You said you were camping with Mikey Davis. Where were you really? We were at the party. We were setting off fireworks in the backyard. One of them went off funny and hit Mikey in the eye. What happened? We went to the hospital. Look, my old man would kill me if he found out I was letting off fireworks. And if Mikey's dad found out... Please don't say anything. Mate, this is a murder investigation. You have to tell us everything you know. I have. About Becky! She's a slut. That doesn't fit with everything else we've heard about her. Look, if you're lying about this again... I can prove it. Anyway, that's the video we got from Bruno. Had it on his iPhone. Says it's been doing the rounds. But where? If she's got no phone, she's got no computer, no Facebook account. Well, it could have been filmed by any kid with a smartphone. I'll get the analyst to track it back. It might take a while to find the source, though. Looks like she's made it for someone specific. Well, check this out. This is for you, B-Boy. Who's B-Boy? Baker Boy. Well, that's Damian Jefferies. Last person to be seen with her. And he can't account for his whereabouts when the other girls went missing. Grab Matt and bring him in. Go. So, BB. I'm guessing that's Baker Boy. It's cute. Do you like to watch her dance? Take off her clothes? What? Becky's video. She made it for you, didn't she? This is for you, B-Boy. So, B-Boy. I've never seen that before. Your work history. Can you confirm those dates, please? I'm not good with dates. He can't read. Saturday night... This again. I already told the snooty chick what happened. Saturday night, you were driving through town. You stopped to talk to Becky. Is that correct? Mm-hm. Did she lean in the passenger window or the driver's window? Passenger. And how did she seem? What do you mean? Well, was she tired? Talkative? Up for it? Becky's not like that. So you didn't have sex with Becky? What? No. Mind giving us a DNA sample? Just help rule you out as a suspect. If you didn't do anything. Yeah. I'm not jacking off into a cup. You see, that's not how it's done. It's just a swab inside the mouth. Well, yeah, and then you plant my DNA on something and stitch me up. So you're refusing to give us a DNA sample? I'm not refusing to do anything. I'm saying I'm not going to do it because I didn't do anything. I am asking you again, are you refusing to give us a DNA sample? Going back to Saturday night, did Becky get in your ute? No. Sure about that? She didn't get in the ute. OK. Then you won't mind if we have a look through it, then, will you? Knock yourself out. What's going on? Uh, move along, Larry. You know... You guys know something, don't ya? Mate, we've got a job to do here. Matt. I think we've got something. Hey, come here. Come on. Film that. Why are they looking in your ute, Damian? Larry... You know we can't tell you what we're doing, so just move on, hey? Come on. 16:55, Wednesday, November 27. The following items were found in this ute belonging to Damian Jefferies. They will be placed in evidence. Come on. Let's go. Yeah. OK. Out of the way, fellas. You've got Cynthia Lewis's bracelet, Jasmine Kyte's friendship ring. In fact, a whole bunch of jewellery belonging to, I'm guessing, a whole bunch of dead girls found in your ute. No way. I don't know where all that shit came from. I'm not a serial killer. Sit down. Sit down. Now! You know what that is, don't you? Becky was carrying that when she left Sophie's party. She was in your car, wasn't she? So, um... Are we still on? Damian, you might as well tell us the truth. It's not gonna help you to lie. Was Becky Ryan in your car? Yes. Did you kill her? No. Did you have sex with her? Yes. Where? Why didn't you tell us? Becky was only 15. And why didn't you drive her home? She knew that she'd get in trouble with her parents if... ..they heard my ute. Her house isn't that far from here if you follow the tracks. I never saw her again. What about after she went missing? You could've helped. I did. I came back here and I was looking for her. I didn't see her. I was walking up and down here, calling her name. I couldn't tell anyone. We were in love. What's going on, Matt? Come on. He do it? Did Damian kill Becky? Larry, you're not doing yourself any favours standing out here, drinking in the street. Matt's talking to him? It's my mate's daughter. We went to primary school together. We go way back. We all want to do the right thing, OK? OK? Now, I know how you're all feeling. Aw, yeah, right you do. This isn't helping. So go home. Tell us! Go home. Let's go. We can have someone drive you home. I can drive myself home if youse haven't taken my ute. We found items in your ute, Damian, from three dead girls. Damian... We will find who killed Becky. See where he goes. Oh, jeez. Give him some space. We're miles away. Personal space is bigger out here. He'd never pass a breathalyser in a million years, hey? Jeez. Supermodel? Does she even have a name? Hey, princess. It's not a good time. Yes. Where is she? Hey! I've got the pathologist on the line. They've identified two more girls from dental records. Melanie Kennedy, missing from Victoria since December 2009. Well, that's good. Right? Well, Damian was working for a company in New South Wales. All the trips were logged. He was out of the state. Well, logbooks can be dummied. Yeah, true. Go on. Shauna Wilson. Disappeared from Queensland in November 2008. Where was Damian then? Backpacking. New Zealand. Logbooks might lie, but passports don't. He was out of the country. Well, if he didn't kill Shauna, then... ..he didn't kill the others. Come on. Lift him nice and high. Come on! Wake up! I want you to be awake for this. Don't! Yes! Hey? No! Stop. Leave him alone. Piss off, Constable. Let him go. Ready? I said let him go. He killed Becky! And if you kill him, you go to jail. He's guilty and he's gonna pay for what he's done. Get in that car and drive. Drive! Step away from the rope. This is your last chance. Bitch! He's OK. He's OK. Don't you move. Don't you fucking move. Hands behind your back! Come here! Small towns, small minds. Idiot redneck lynch mob right-wing fuckwits. You see, you know? This is why I left the country. Imagine the paperwork on this one. It would have been easier if Bridget had shot him in the head. So we've got two profiles, two killers, and we're looking at a partnership, a protege. Well, if he's a protege, he's not doing a very good job. I just feel like I'm staring at something obvious and I'm not seeing it. It never occurred to you, huh? Maybe. Just a little bit. We can't do this. Do what? Pick up like nothing ever happened. You're the one who wanted some space. 10 years, two kids and a marriage. Well, technically two marriages. You had a job to do. Ah, yes. Befriend a child killer. Endear yourself. Make him like you, you said. And you did. And look what happened. You're the best that I've seen at getting under a suspect's skin, Eve. You become what they need and before they know it they're spilling their guts. This was never about finding Becky, was it? Was it? McKenzie. Another girl's gone missing. Tamara Adams was on a driving holiday with her boyfriend. She went missing from the Dubbo Show last Saturday. Wait, last Saturday? The same day Becky went missing? Dubbo's only 100km from here. Even so, two girls on the same day? They had a fight, she walked off. When she didn't return to the hotel, the boyfriend just assumed that she'd dumped him for good this time. Alarm didn't go off till yesterday when they were due back in Sydney. The boyfriend could be lying. What makes us think that this is one of the serial killer victims? This. She could be their sister. Right look, right age, right time of year. OK, Damian's out as a suspect. Who's top of our list? It's not Jackson Ciesolka. Not if it's a Saturday. Jackson Ciesolka spends every Saturday night with me. No-one else knows except his mate Lincoln. Shit. That's what the fight with Lincoln De Luca was about. What did you say to my fiancee? What?! Did you tell her about Angie? No! Are you willing to vouch for Jackson on Saturday night? Yeah. We need to cross-reference every man in town who could've killed the other girls with those who could've been in Dubbo last Saturday. What do I tell Becky's parents? That we're still investigating her murder. But we're not. Matt, Becky's dead. Tamara may not be. OK, the original police witness statements concentrated on Becky, but checking against Tamara Adams, we've got three people with major inconsistencies in their statements or time lines. Number one, Larry Fernando. He's Becky's dad's best friend. Fudged the time line in his statements, can't account for his whereabouts on Saturday, and it also might explain his attack on Damian Jeffries, trying to deflect guilt. Well, he's got flexible holidays so he can take them whenever he wants. He was working a mine in WA when Melanie Kennedy went missing in Queensland, so he can't be our guy. Second. Brett Holloway. His statement was odd. Answered all the questions, time line was perfect. But there's something cold about it. No warm adjectives, all clinical. What else do we know about him? He's a fireman who's got flexible holidays as well. He's attractive. Yeah, he was rostered on at the fire station on Saturday night, so he's out as well. Next. And last. The school principal. Brian Fleet. Definitely hiding something. No adjectives, no descriptors, keeps his answers as brief as possible. Something was going on with him last Saturday. You think that I killed all those girls? I am married. I have a wife, I have a life. This is preposterous. Where were you November 17 last year? I don't have to answer that question. If you've got nothing to hide... Last year... I don't even know. Well, we do. You spent the weekend at a conference in Bathurst. Yes. Yes. Right. Future Directions in Education. That's the same weekend that Mandy Hughes went missing, right? On her way to Bathurst. Where were you last Saturday? I was at home. I was gardening. I... I finished around lunchtime, and then I drove to Dubbo to get some school supplies. Tamara Adams disappeared from Dubbo last Saturday. You talk to my wife, OK? She'll tell you that I'm not the person you're looking for. You talk to Jennifer. Five and six and seven and eight. Yes, of course I can vouch for him. Brian and I spend all our time together. There's no way he... Brian came home from Dubbo at what time? 5:30. Exactly? Yes. He likes an early dinner. He walked in while I was cutting onions. Um... I remember because I was crying and he handed me a box of tissues. That sound like the actions of a heartless murderer? You'd be surprised. Look... Brian may be a control freak, but he's not a... cold-blooded serial killer. He loves holding my hand. He's actually a very tactile man. My husband did not do this. Well, she's convinced he hasn't done anything. She may be right. He's hiding something. He's really jumpy. There's a righteous indignation but there's real fear there as well. He's terrified we'll expose something. I wish we knew what. That was the IT analyst. She's managed to track back the source of the video. Hello. We spoke on the phone. Hi. Yes. Is Sophie here? Yes. Come in to the kitchen. We'd like to show you something. ♪ It's our party, we can say what we want ♪ It's our party, we can love who we want, ♪ We can kiss who we want, we can say what we want ♪ To my home girls here with the big butts ♪ Shakin' it like we at a strip club... ♪ We didn't mean anything by it. Who did you make it for, Sophie? Damian. But you never sent it to him. Yeah, we did. Off Becky's Facebook. Well, Becky doesn't have a Facebook account. Not in her name. Her parents would kill her, so we made one up. RR - Rebecca Ryan. And she was posting to BB, so it was kind of cute. Well, Damian says he never got the video. Course he did. He replied. They were emailing. He doesn't have a computer or an internet account. But he's B-Boy. He can't be. I'll have to go back to IT. We need to find out who was emailing Becky. So when did you start cyberstalking Becky Ryan? It's just emailing. It's actually called grooming a minor. We know that you posed as Damian Jeffries to communicate with Becky. It was just for fun. Alright? I just wanted to see what students were up to. I just wanted to see what they were saying about me. Just fun. You know, it's actually... it's actually quite explicit. "Hey, Becky. "I'd like to lick you all over. "How'd you like me to go down on you? "I'd like to run my hands down your body, "inside your panties, "and touch your delicate little flower. "I can give you the best." Dan, stop! What? Why did you do it? Hm? These girls... They hate me. They draw pictures and they say things behind my back. Online, they flirt with me. They love me. It's not you. They're not writing to you. Are we sure he didn't kill Becky and the girls? The profiles don't match. The serial killer is organised, careful, clinical. Becky's killer is disorganised, panicked, messy. Yeah, but maybe Fleet wasn't planning on killing Becky. I mean, what if he started to believe the emails really were for him? He could have propositioned her in person, she's ridiculed him, it's ended badly. I still like Damian for Becky. He was the last person to see her. They had a fight. Maybe something went wrong. Damian doesn't feel right to me. Well, how about we try going on the evidence, not just our feelings? I'm sorry. Let's get back to basics. Check his credit cards for the time the girls went missing. Let's confirm exactly where Brian Fleet was... ..and hold him until we do. Oh, God. I know that look. I was just thinking about something Angie said about a young fox, panics, kills in a frenzy. There's something else here I'm trying to put my finger on. Becky and Sophie posted that video on Becky's secret site, so how did Bruno get it on his smart phone? Maybe he downloaded it from a site? I dunno. But it was a private posting. It only went to BB. They're friends, they live next door to each other... Maybe she showed him. Maybe... Maybe Bruno was in it with Becky and Sophie. They wouldn't. It was a girl thing. You wouldn't share it with a boy. Maybe she did. Bruno said she was a bit of a slut, right? How... Why? Why would Bruno say something like that? You were right about Damian. He didn't kill Becky. He didn't need to kill the girl. He had the girl already. See, the good-looking ones, they always get what they want, but this one didn't. The young fox. What are you doin' here? We're here for Bruno. Mikey and me, we let off the fireworks. I took him to the hospital. And then I went home. Saw them... ..doin' it, you know? I caught up to her and I... ..I told her she was meant to be with me and she just... She hugged me. Becky. Bruno. What are you doing here? Don't... Get off! You didn't want to be hugged, did you? You didn't want to just be friends. No. Bruno... I took her body to the grave. She... I thought everyone might think the serial killer had killed her. Did you cut her ankles? How did you know the killer did that? Only the police knew. Mikey overheard you talking to Mr Davis. How did you get her there? We need to know. Mikey helped... We took his wheelbarrow. I didn't mean to... I never meant to hurt her. She just... I hit her and she fell. She just fell. Bruno and Mikey dumped the body but they didn't plant the jewellery in Damian's ute. No. So why set up Damian? Why him? For all the killer knew, Damian could have had a solid alibi for Saturday night. He took a gamble that he didn't. Paid off. Our killer isn't a gambler. He's methodical. He was chosen for a reason. What if he knew that Damian didn't have an alibi because he saw him? He was here somewhere in town, watching. So if the killer saw Damian and Becky that night... Did Damian see our serial killer? Why should I help? I told you I didn't kill Becky. You didn't believe me, now I'm stuck here. You're here because you've been charged with sexual assault! I told you before, I loved her! It wasn't rape! Now she's dead because of some demented little nerd. That's not my fault! OK, alright... Damian... I'm really sorry about what happened to you and I am really sorry about what happened to Becky. We can't help her now, but we can find Tamara. What do you want to know? OK, it's midnight. You've just picked up Becky and you're driving. What'd you talk about? The party. How it sucked. Young kids getting pissed and throwing up. Laughed about it. Then what happened? Nothing. We just drove. It was night. The road, the moon... I could smell her hair. Did you have the radio on? No, CD. Becky put it on. She put on Guns N' Roses. I said not many girls would have chosen that. But... She said, "I'm not like..." ..like other girls. And what road did you take? Main Road. Any traffic? None. There was nothing. Did you take the Seymour Road turn-off? Uh... No. No. A bit further on. Just... just past the town sign. Then I had to flip my rear-view mirror up. Why? There was a car behind. He must have had his high beams on. That's freaky. I honestly didn't remember that before. That's great. Keep going. Um... uh... Well, I just... just took the turn and the truck just kept going. Truck? Yeah. It had to be. The lights were high up. They weren't on high beam. Can you describe the truck? Make, model, colour? No, no. That's all I remember. Alright, well, describe the lights. Well, they were lights... They were bright. They were high up. Doubles. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There were double lights. OK, that's great. Anything else? Yeah, the smell. Shit. It was a sheep truck. So, someone drove their sheep to Dubbo and came back with Tamara Adams. Well, so not Brian Fleet. I mean, he doesn't have sheep. He drove his Subaru back to Dubbo. Yes, but one of our shortlist does have sheep, and he sold a truckload in Dubbo last Saturday. Owns a small farm on the outskirts of town. Brett Holloway. Hang on. He was up for everything, but he was working last Saturday. Actually, he wasn't. I double-checked. He was rostered on but he called in sick. He didn't actually work the shift. And he knows about asbestos. He worked a clearing site near Lithgow. Well, let's go. Hang on. Someone cool enough to murder five girls and dump them under his neighbours' noses isn't gonna let us anywhere near his property. We need a search warrant. Cross-check his movements with our victims'. Times, dates. I want to know how many buildings, outhouses, sheds, dams, wells are on it. Anywhere that he could hide a young woman. He's got an ex-wife. I'm gonna talk to her if she's still around. Jennifer Holloway nee Russ. Now Fleet. What, the dance teacher? Yeah. So Jennifer's been married to two of our prime suspects. That's got to mean something. Hey, Chloe. How are you? I met Brett when I was still a professional dancer. He loved watching me dance. What was he like? Charming. Romantic. He followed me around the country, different venues. Always in the front row. He courted me, bought me flowers. He swept me off my feet. I loved that someone wanted me that much. We married quickly. Too quickly. What happened? After the wedding, he was a different person. It's like he had one personality for the hunt and the complete opposite once he'd got what he wanted. You were a conquest. I felt captured. He wanted me to be perfect, like one of those dancers in a music box. Admired, brought out on special occasions. There was no communication, nothing. We're doing Little Red Riding Hood. Hi. Detective Sergeant Eve Winter. Yeah, yeah. I know who you are. I'm Brett. How you going? Do you mind if I ask you something? Oh, yeah. I'm free Saturday night. That old charm your wife mentioned. Sorry. Ex-wife. So, uh... ..what did you want to know? Why didn't you mention you were driving through town on Saturday night? Well, I, uh... I didn't say anything because, I mean, didn't see anything. You were driving back from Dubbo, is that right? Yeah. So you would have been driving a sheep truck, then. Well, yeah. I couldn't fit them in the station wagon, so... When did you talk to Jennifer? Just now. And you were asking about me? Yes, I was. Why? Police business. What are you doing? Just closing up. We can get out that way. I'm going to walk you to your hotel. That's not necessary. No, no. There's a killer out there and, I mean, you just can't be too careful. I mean, he could take you down right now. No-one would ever know. I've got a gun. Would you have enough time to use it? Thanks for your time, Brett. I'll see myself out. Yeah, righto. Secured search warrants to his farm. He's consented to be interviewed. Well, we don't have nearly enough to charge him. No. We have to be careful. He's here voluntarily. If we spook him and he shuts down, then we've got nowhere to go. This guy is a fireman. He's a bloke. He's practically one of us. I can get to this guy. He's not a fireman, he's a serial killer. He just looks like a fireman. What do you think? I think Bridget's right. Sure, it was embarrassing when Jenny left. But what was I gonna do? Kill myself? In fact, I got pretty good mileage out of it. I mean, every unattached women in town kept asking me over for dinner. I didn't have to cook for six months. You four go down to the sheep pen. You go down there. Down there. Have you ever been dumped, Detective Sergeant? Or can I call you Eve? Sure. Sure you've been dumped or... sure I can call you Eve? Yes to both. Then you know the pain of rejection. Deeply. Mmm. It's like acid in your guts. Eats away. I know the feeling. And did you become a serial killer because of it? Of course you didn't. You got over it. And so did I. I would like to see my lawyer. He's not going to talk. Think about what he wants. This is all about him gaining revenge for his ex walking out, yeah? Yeah, well, maybe you should let Bridget have a go at him. She won't be able to crack him. I need you to do it. Jesus, you're unbelievable. What? What? You want me to go there again, don't you? Become what Brett Holloway needs. To get the job done, yes. Screw you. This isn't about us, Eve. This is about Tamara Adams. The search teams can't find her. If we don't get this right, she dies. He's waiting for her to die. Do you want to give him that satisfaction? I said I wanted my lawyer. He's coming. So, Eve, what are we going to talk about while we wait? Your wife? Nah. No, that's boring. Are you married? I almost married someone once. Ah. Seems like a long time ago now. Why didn't you? We were working together. Sleeping together. It all got so compromised. I needed to take a breath. Well, to tell you the truth, I think I pushed him away deliberately. Why would you do that? Don't know. Maybe deep down marriage scares me. I don't like being contained. And I watched my parents' marriage implode. Ah. Yeah. My father was a cop. Everyone thought he was charming too. And he was. Like you. Everyone thought he was a hero. He killed himself. My mother had left him two months before and... ..everyone thought he did it because he loved her so much he couldn't bear to live without her. But it wasn't that. He orchestrated his death so that my mother would find him. He wanted the last image she had of him to be with his head blown off. That way she'd never forget him. He wasn't doing it out of grief. He was punishing her. You'd understand that, wouldn't you? Because when Jennifer left, you wanted to kill her, didn't you? Oh, that would have been too easy. What she'd done to you, she wouldn't have suffered enough. So how do you punish her without killing her? Without killing yourself? You kill her over and over... ..and over again. Each new girl is another Jennifer. Captured. Contained. Killed. Whore. It's Jennifer. I think she knows where he keeps them. It was weird. It started out as fine and then... ..Brett wanted me to dress up in my dance costume and give him a private show. Except for where we did it. He was obsessed with the idea of me being a dancer in one of those music boxes. So he put me in a box. What sort of box? A shipping container. Up in the back scrub at my parents' place. Mad idea my mum had. She wanted to turn it into a sweat lodge or something and... ..my dad never let her. It's the only place we had sex where Brett could get it up. OK. Gentleman from the TRG, thanks for joining us here in Mingara. Detective Inspector Lachlan McKenzie will brief you on the situation. We've got a shipping container on an isolated property. We're not sure if there are any accomplices or if the suspect has rigged it in any way. Any questions? Let's go. You guys go ahead and go around the back and make it safe. Tamara? Tamara?! You right? - Yeah. Easy, easy. Easy. Cover it. Tamara. She's alive. She's alive! Ambulance! Ambulance, now! Is there a silver cross? No. But there's nails. Bridget... Hmm? It's a smiley face. Ready to make an arrest? No, I'll let you have the glory. Eve. Nup. I'm serious. I've done my bit. You go do yours. You too, Bridget. I might get a lift with Matt. There's someone I want to say goodbye to. Sure thing. Let's go. We're charging Brett. You can't blame yourself. Can't I? Is Chloe here? She doesn't want to go home either. Chloe? Hi, Chloe. I miss my sister. Hey. I know you do. I came third. It's for you. Thanks, sweetheart. Chloe, you know what? I think you need to get home. Your mum and dad are going to be worried about you, OK? Yes. Come on. I'll walk with you. Eve. Hey, Chloe. What do you want? Well, not you, Jen, that's for sure. Off you go. You too, Chloe, hey? Run along home now. Come on. Don't let the big, bad wolf get ya. Ah-ah-ah. You weren't fast enough this time, were you? How did you get out? Don't you just love bloody lawyers? Are you pleased with yourself? You ruined my little game with Jennifer. Would it ever have been enough, Brett? No matter how many times she did it. Were you ever really satisfied? Yeah, but no-one knew it was me until you showed up. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, Eve. Eve, Eve, Eve. Eve. Do you remember that story you told me? About your dad's parting shot? I really like that idea. No. The bullet's gonna go through my jaw here. Through my brain. And out the top of my head. Should be quite a sight. Oh, come on, Eve. You know you wanna see this. It'd be something to remember me by. Go on. Do it. Nice to be anonymous again. Are you OK? Seeing Brett. What he did. It was the best thing he could do for everyone. Saves the parents the pain of a trial, lawyers' tricks. And you? When my father killed himself, I never saw his body, I just heard the stories. I think the image in my brain was worse than actually seeing it. I never knew. Back then I thought I knew you so well. So what now, hmm? You can't go back to your desk job. You're too good. We're good together. Yes, we are. Lachlan McKenzie. Detached, cool, pragmatic. Something wrong with that? No, not at all. The perfect man to head up a task force. But not for you. No. I'll see you.
