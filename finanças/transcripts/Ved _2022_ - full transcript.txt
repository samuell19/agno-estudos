Love! Love is like the tides in the sea, sometimes high, sometimes low. Love is like a handful of sand... Your hand is full, until you hold it tight, open, and it's gone. Love is like an ocean, some get to surf the waves, some get stranded on the shore. But love is unique... Some fall in love madly... some become the madness, in love! Namaskar (Greetings!) Hey, move away, idiots! Namaskar! I welcome you all to the finals of our 'District World Series'. Namaskar, my name is Suresh! It's the final match of our 'District World Series'. I too welcome you, Namaskar! What a lovely shot! -And Bhaskar Anna's buffaloes... -Bulls... They are bulls. Bhaskar Anna's Bulls have set the field on fire. Go man... chase the ball... Run... Run... Chandu is chasing the ball... and the ball is luring chandu... And that's a four... 'Bhaskar Bulls' is seven-time winner of this tournament. Is it so? So, let's see how long can the 'Yuva 11' team face this seven-time winner. Ramesh ji... your language is quite impressive. -I mean, your vocabulary is quite strong. -Yes, I know... I am sure, they will win this match and set a new record for themselves. Was my commentary equally impressive? And here comes, MLA Bhaskar Anna... Future MLA... we warmly welcome him. Start the music... Long live... Bhaskar Anna... Long live... Bhaskar Anna... [indistinct chatter] Bhaskar Anna is now on the stage... He now has a bird's view of the field. His hands are on his hips... His personality is quite dashing. Okay stop it. You may take your seat Anna... I guess, he took his seat, a bit too swiftly, before I could announce. Are these players any good? Or just Buffaloes as their name suggests? Anna... it's always wise to set the exam paper, than studying. What do you mean? We have bribed the umpire... We will win this final match. And... bullseye, the ball hits the stumps... -No ball. -How's my vocabulary? The Umpire doesn't seem to be interested... let's carryon ... Ramesh, I feel... Bhaskar Anna will surely win this match. As he has fixed this match. Err... I meant... I meant... his team is determined to win. As an ardent fan, I can see it happening. The score is 196. Shambu is at the striking end. That was a scintillating sixer. Whoa... That's another four... That was a pull shot... This shot is new to me... but this one is quite good. Bowler is ready to bowl... and batsman is ready to hit. I see the umpire scratching... Hey you... I guess the second inning has just begun. Sir, why do you keep scratching? Yuva team has to face a massive target of 283 runs. That's the first ball. How was that!? Is he out? -Out. - The umpire declared 'out'... That was an awesome drive... I guess it was a cover drive. That's the next delivery... The player tried hard to come forward and hit the ball. And our Anna lost another wicket... I am sure, Anna is not too happy seeing this. That was a swift pull shot. I guess they will score two runs... The player tried hard to score the 2nd run. How was that!? And... he is out! He is out! Hey, he is not out... But the umpire has declared 'Out'. Satya, do something man, they are cheating. But the umpire is always right. There goes the next delivery... That was a good shot... The score is 22 in 3 overs. There goes the next delivery... Out! Batsman Santosh who works at PWD, just got eliminated by LBW. Satya... Bhaskar's men have bribed the Umpire. That's an impressive dive by the batsman. yet he is out... Another wicket gone. That's cheating man, he was not out. the score is 53 for 6 wickets. -Come on... -Hold on... Pass on your Bluetooth... Here, use this and give the other one to the other player. Give me your phone... Here, keep this. Go... and do as I direct. That's the end of the Honeymoon. Do as I direct... Okay? Come on boys... Third man, step in... Fine leg, go behind... He is going to bowl shot, go for pull shot. That's our speed bowler... And... that was an impressive pull shot... and that's a sixer. Fine leg is behind... Long leg is inside... He will deliver a bouncer. Go for an upper cut. That's another sixer. Played for four runs. Bhaskar Bulls is now in deep trouble... The next delivery will be a good length, in the line of stumps... Step out and hit it. The batsman moves forward to hit the ball... and that's another sixer... Shattering Six... Good shot! The air leaks from the gap between my teeth... Ah... that's because there is no gap in your case. Go for a late cut... -Whoa! that's a four. -Upper cut... Sixer... Oh God, this is a miracle... The tables have turned... Whoa... that was a super shot. Last ball and we need a sixer to win. Last ball, runs required 6. Step out and go for a cover shot. Let's see if our friend Nagraj can face this delivery. Catch it man... The Umpire has declared 'out'... Hey... I am not a player... Looks like both the players are out now! That's a sixer. Start the music... -Yuva 11 has won this match. -We won! Bribed the umpire, my foot! Amazing. -Go to hell! -Congratulations Yuva 11 for winning this one. Sir... Thank you, sir, this victory wouldn't have been possible without you. You guys deserved to win. Sir, will you please join us for the celebrations? No... -Please sir... -Sir, please come... We love you... at least join us for the sake of our love? for the sake of love? Okay, can you book room no. 606, at Hotel Taj for me? Sure sir... Yay! [Cricket match on tv] Don't move, or I'll kill you. The bowler is not ready yet, -I will be back before he bowls... -Wait! Sachin is about hit a century, no one moves till then. Sit down! Century! Century! Oh God... -It's a wrong shot.- He needed just one to finish a century... Just one run... People pray and fast for the victory of our country. Couldn't you hold your pee? Satya... I am sorry. Hey Jonty... You had a night shift today, didn't you? I guess, you guys were planning to enjoy the day & night match, hence, I got my shift changed. Thank you Satya, for these notes... Hold on... wait dear... I know my boy is a good for nothing, so, I asked you guys to help him improve... but you guys are worse. Saraswathi... I hope you are watching over these boys. Wish I had not promised you, by now I would've smashed him to pulp... Is your mixer out of order? Cracking a joke, is it? You all are engineering students, after graduation you can join the Railways. But... look at you... Dad... I want to be a cricketer... that's it. I wanted to be the Minister of Railways... But I am only good at waving flags. The train should always be on track, else a mishap is inevitable. Do you understand? Dad, have you heard the cheering on 'Sachin's entry? One day, you will hear it for me... "Satya" "Satya" "Satya" Please come soon, Satya... Hey... go and find out what's the problem. People are screaming, and not cheering... "Satya" Satya... please see what's wrong with electricity. I should be in the limelight... but here I am, trying to fix a fused light. Satya, I warn you... do not touch it... you will ruin it further... I have called someone from the electronics. Your intelligence is quite evident... ... electronics, is it? Don't act too smart, and ruin it further. There is Nothing more that could go wrong. You shut up! Pass on the torch please. Pass it on man... Whoa... He has restored the electricity. Thank you dear... What's the need to thank him? Was that a big deal? The kid is always helpful, and there is no harm if you praise him for a change. The selection for Railway Cricket Team is on... I want to see you in that team... I have been playing for the 'B' team, since last two years. The coach has not seen my game yet. I won't be selected... for sure. Pick it up... Keep it there. Take these inside. Wait... Go get some marigold flowers, be quick... Hey... go walking. Leave the bike here... Your father is a miser... Damn, we'll have to walk... Run... Run... For others, it's just a game. But you guys will be doubly benefitted, by selections and the railways placement. Trials are about to begin, so, gear up. We need to up our game. Yes sir... The last season, Aniket saved us from disgrace. He is injured, is there any replacement? I think we should try Sarvesh... Sarvesh, is a good choice. -But I think... -Sir... I believe Aniket is injured, give me a chance please. Satya... you have a long way to go. May be next year, okay? Sir... Please sir... Satya... Sir may not know your caliber, But I have seen you play... Will you please put in a word for me? 10 grand... What? I will do that, for 10 grand. What? Is sport a business now? It's all about money, honey... Think about it. What do you think? Actually, I intended to draw a Peacock... This looks more like a Hippo... You idiot... I was talking about the 10 grand. Do we have a choice? We must pay him... Or waste another full year, Satya... My father will never agree... Let's try my father then... Look... Hey, you sick idiot, Can you please control yourself? I have an idea... Let's help my father in executing this wedding event. You work for him and let's ask him to compensate. Okay? How do you expect me to forget it? Satya is just a kid... Kid? Satya? Get him married now, in a year you will be a grandfather. So, what do you suggest? Should I go and clean the wall? No, why should you? As is, you are raising an irresponsible guy single handedly. Murli... I know he urinates on walls... But he is not aware that I know it. If he gets know, that I know, I am sure, he is capable of urinating on our house walls too. Just a tip... Don't let him know, that you know about his activity. Don't forget your house has walls too... Father is worse than his son. It's better to die, rather living such a sick life... -So when is the date? -What? Hey... who's that, talking nonsense? Satya... your lighting prowess shouldn't be any less than your batting skills. I am sure, your silly father will fall in love with me, seeing my lighting skills. Your Nisha is such a sweetheart... She was very helpful. Yes, indeed... I was worried, if we will be bogged down by the wedding arrangements. Nisha, managed everything so well. Of course... Kaveri is her best friend. I am so glad we got this opportunity to host this ceremony at my place... Where is Nisha? Are you done? Will you be taking me home? Yes... No! Let me go man... Not a single cable should be visible... Clear this mess now. Is that set up ready? How long man? Hello... Mr. Heartbeats... Do not forget, you are a cricketer. Don't play hide and seek... I just caught her... I am a cricketer, you see... Hey Nishu... Please marry me... Okay... Okay? Okay! You are kidding! How can only you get to crack a joke? Come on... Our parents have given their consent. I am interested in you... What about you? Okay! Okay? Will you please check if the priest has arrived? Not for our wedding dear... I meant, for this engagement today. Hey Dug-Dug... get up... My Mom is missing... It's you who is missing, not your mom... Let's find your mom... Come on. Ah, there she is... the one getting decked up. Is that your mom? Yes! Where is your dad? He left us in the morning... What? He passed away in the morning. and here she is busy dressing up? He went in the morning... Now he is back... Dad... That's his father, she is the mother... and still they are getting engaged? What a mess it is! All set Amar? any problems dude? Dude? Nisha... You consider Kaveri your sister, right? Yes. So, address your brother-in-law, with respect. With respect? Yes... Kaveri, rejected two guys, before accepting your proposal... and, I convinced her to accept you. Here, you are showing your true colors at the engagement. She decides to watch a film, only if she likes the trailer... My mom is on stage... she is busy with her photoshoot. -Okay, I will convey... -Hey, kiddo... The girl on the stage, is that your mom? Yes... And, the one over there, that's your dad, right? Nonsense, he may be your father... My dad is on this table. Hey fatso... come over here... The one on stage, is she your mom? Yes... And... is that your dad? Yes... And... he is your father... -and, she's your mom? -Yes... Hey, let's go... It was already a triangle... ... but now a quadrangle? What a mess it is! I stole from my father's till, yet it's just 8 grand... Still, we need to manage 2 more... She is already managing 2... What? Sick, the same tune playing at two different radio stations. What? The girl who is getting engaged today, is already married twice... What? and has two kids... What? And her kids and two husbands are all present here... What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What's going on here? Looks like they are not too happy with the caterer. What about our lunch? Run! Stop it! Amar, who told you Kaveri is married twice? And about her two kids? This guy... This lady. This guy... She. I heard the light men gossiping. He said, Kaveri is twice married, and has two kids. You are 2 grand short! Please adjust this time... This is not a rikshaw (public transport) to adjust and accommodate! You won't regret man, Satya is like a rocket. Just adjust this one time... Okay, you will be the 9th player. Okay, done... Nonsense... I am an opening batsman... 9th man is better than the 12th man. Great... Great... Well-done... Good show... What an amazing century, Kunal. How can you be so irresponsible, Vijay? Mohan... I told you to keep at good length. Our bowling line-up was pathetic. I hope you guys will not let me down with your batting line up. And please stick to the game plan... Come on, come on boys... We can do it... Go, get up... Come on. Fine leg and square leg both are inside the circle... He should just step out of off stump and hit a sweep shot. Well done boys. Hard luck... You should've gone for a sweep shot... Extra cover is within the circle... He should just step out and go for an inside out shot. Oh God! Well bowled... Satya... -Pad up! -Me? Go! Come on... Come on... Well done... Good bowling... We want one more wicket... Go for it... Good, good... Satya! Good shot... Satya! Oh no. Hey... pass the ball... Six! Good shot Satya. Watch. Get some water... Satya, are you alright? Get some water... Hurry up. Call it retired hurt. Come on boys... It was so embarrassing... such a silly misunderstanding. Nisha... Where have you been? Do you even know what we went through? What's wrong now? The light technician, came and cleared all our confusion. We blamed him for no reason. True... The confusion was created by these tiny tots... Hence, he was confused... Don't blame us... I pointed at my mom... He was a fool to look at aunt Kaveri and conclude. I am sorry... It's okay. What? Your planning was flawless... Kunal was hinting at something. Not now dad... Okay... He is waiting for you... Do meet him once... Okay? Come on cheer up now... Looks like someone pelted stones at you. Are you such a lousy player? I smashed all deliveries of a bowler, and he did this to me out of frustration. -Did you see a doctor? -Of course I did... He said, to recover quickly, I should have Jilebis (Indian sweets), twice a day. Are you sure he was a doctor and not a sweetmeat owner? It's enriched with vitamin B... 'Ji... Le...' 'B...' Oh! 'Ji... le... bi'? Are you trying to fool your father? Just a minute... Don't act smart! here, This is as good as... nothing. Ji, le, bi... Silly sweet tooth! You freaking car... Kunal... please step out for a while... I want to talk to him. What? Step out please. Hi! I am Nisha... Please get inside, I want to talk to you. Excuse me... I am Satya... I heard from my family, that you clarified all misunderstandings. Now I know the facts... I lost my job... what about that? How should I support my widowed mom and handicapped sister? Tell me? My drunkard uncle who abuses me daily, what do I tell him? I was not paid for the work done. Err... let me... I was kidding dear... Shut up! Okay, I will see you at the pre-wedding ceremony. I lost my job, that's for sure... it wasn't a joke. Oh, sorry... It's okay... Come as my guest. See you... Sorry for that... Okay. but I am not sorry for... this. "You quite awesome... " "You are blossom... " "You are pleasant, carefree like weather" "You are charming... " "You are darling... " "You are like a fully charged morning... " "My life was black and white and dull... " "You are the one who colored it bright." "I was always lost in my own dreams." "And you are the queen of my dreams." "You are the one and only love of my life" "The one I always dreamt about." "You are the one and only love of my life" "The one I always dreamt about." -You shop so much... -What are you saying? Oh gosh, she is so beautiful... -Where? -No, don't turn... -What? -You will make her conscious ... Why do you say so? Do you want to see her? Okay, look at her... See... you made her conscious. "I feel blocked, locked, shocked and lost in your love." "I feel wasted completely in your love." "I feel lost, I keep forgetting I exist, when I see you." "I feel nervous, I fumble, I melt when you just look at me." "I have lost my heart somewhere, where do I look for my lost heart?" "I am crazy for you day and night," "will you accept me and give your hand to me?" "You are the one and only love of my life" "The one I always dreamt about." "You are the one and only love of my life" "The one I always dreamt about." There it is... I loved this dress, I want to wear this one for the wedding. Let's go inside... Hey, the shop is shut for a week. No problem. let's go. How can you give up so easily? One should pine for things, until there is a possibility to achieve it. Come on... let's go... Hey, silly photographer... use another angle man... Better... Anna (Boss), should stand-out and shine. Do you understand? Anna, let me see the future minister's swag. Whoa, that's it... Stop it I say... Clear the room, get that guy inside... Leave my hand... Sir, welcome... This is Mr. Bankar... He is an umpire at the upcoming minister's tournament. -He is a teacher. -Please sit... we had to interrupt his class to bring him... You idiots... you should've let him finish his lecture. Education and such honest teachers are the need of the hour. But he is not willing to collab with us. Collaboration means fixing. And fixing is unethical. No means no... Okay... Let him go... Drop him outside school no. 24. Your kid must be waiting for you. I have told you guys several times, to build a speed breaker outside school no. 24. What if right outside his school, ... his kid gets killed in an accident? Okay, you may leave. I am willing... to co-operate... Please come again? I am willing to co-operate... That's the right word... I have been trying hard to find a synonym for the word 'collaboration', in Marathi. Now, I know... Satya... Get out in this over. What? I want you to get out... I don't cheat. Do as I say... Idiot. Satya, run... No... No... Yes... Idiots... we lost such an easy match... And you... Satya... You played like an ass... Sir, I got run out, because of him. -What do you mean? -Yes, I did... That's because, he fixed this match. What? And he offered to buy me out... Sir, this guy is a cheat. -He offered me money. -He is lying. -Stop it. -Sir, he is a liar... Stop it! Satya, I said, stop it. There is no place for cheaters in my team. And I trust him. You are not a part of my team anymore. Get out... Sir, -he is a cheater. -Satya, I said, out! Leave! How is that possible? Didn'tyou try to explain? I tried, but my coach was supporting the captain. In fact he was screaming at me. Forget it... From tomorrow, you start playing football. What? Football? Cricket is my life... Cricket is my life... is all rubbish... ... To be so rigid with your choices. I wanted a particular dress for the wedding, I didn't' get it... so, should I avoid attending the wedding? How's this? Ganya... Yes, Anna... Who is she? I don't know her... but the guy with her is... Satya... Who, Satya? We would've lost our last match because of him. Glad we collaborated with the captain. Why should a captain, or a coach decide your fate? You are the captain of your life. Only you have the right to control your life. Never let anyone control your life. Yesterday, I bought a vest from you, only to discover this... camisole after reaching home. Please explain. Do you expect me to wear this? -My wife was very livid. -Sorry, sir. I suggest you shut your shop now... come with me and apologize to my wife. You need to tighten your reins... Your son is flirting around with his girlfriend. Murli... I know he may have a girlfriend. He doesn't know that I know, If he comes to know that, I know, then he will ask me to get him married to her... And that will be the end of his cricketing career... He can't be playing cricket inside our house... What if he has to face a no-ball? He is such a sick father... It's better to die, rather living such a wasted life like his. Shut up! Sir, I want to apologize for... Satya, I don't want to talk to you. Sir, please hear me out. Don't you understand? I am not interested in talking to fixers. Do come see us play... It's your fate to be an audience. Good morning, guys... Ganya... I can tolerate everything... but injustice... I see vast skies... and he has powerful wings... but he is banned from flying. Such a sad state... hey 'Angry Bird'... Spit this fire on the pitch, not on me. Do you understand? If you want to prove them wrong, then play for my team. Give it a try... Take it... I will open this match... Yes, you open this match... and I will close this chapter. I smashed a century... and won the match. Fantastic... finally you convinced your coach! I played for the opposite team. Playing is important. The wedding is at night... Don't be late. In life, if you don't get what you want, then what's the point? What did you get? What did you get... ... by selling off my father's bike? You can sell off my father's scooter. Okay... Did you guys find my bike? -No! -No! I am unable to find it since afternoon. Actually, since morning. What? I couldn't find your bike since morning... and he couldn't too... what? Our bike... Who? Find the bike. Yes. Come, let's search... find out who conned you... what? I mean, let's find if someone stole it from you. The shop was shut... Yes... It's still shut... Have you always been a perfectionist? Yes, at least during such special moments. Wedding is not just another event. It's the most important moment of our life. That moment is like... the delicately folded corner of a page in the book of our life. We may have finished reading the entire book, yet we can always come back to the bookmarked page. As we frequently, love to experience this special moment of our life. That's why one should strive hard to make this extra special. We all have our special moments in life. What about you? This moment... is that bookmarked page in my life. Wow... this is beautiful. You did this for me? Why? I like you. And what if I don't like you? I will still keep liking you... all my life... Do you love me so much? What I feel for you, is not love... it's madness. I want to make love to you. "After meeting you, I felt as if... " "... the desires of my heart have been fulfilled." "O my faithful beloved... " "together we both are one life." "We'll always be together... " "I won't separate from you." Hey, damn it... -Who the hell is this guy? -Sit... Hey carryon... He is our Satya... Brother... looks like you are day dreaming... Come join us... I am a bit busy brother. Busy? I know you have been quite busy... at the beach... at shopping... sometimes at the bus stop. Lovebirds... Good, keep going... And why do you guys meet at public places? Take her to some private place... Now I know what your problem is... Here, the keys to our party office. The office will remain shut for two days... Thank you... You are like my brother. Satya, remember, always safety first. Excuse me... What do you want? Err... I mean... An umbrella? Umbrella, here? I mean... a cap... Umbrella, I meant a cap? Seat cover? Umbrella, cap, seat cover? Yes... Helmet? Speak up man... what do you want? Condom... What? Condom? What are you embarrassed about? Flavor? Do me one favor... give any flavor... Give him a condom... Here... -What's this? -Condom! Yes... Should I have it with water? I wanted a strip of Crocin. I want medication for headache, and you want me to suffocate and die? Condom is not for this gentleman... -It's for him over there... -Sorry sir. -Enjoy! -Thanks... Satya... So, is this your new activity? Is your father aware of this? I will convey this to your father. But no point talking to his father... It's better to die, rather having a son like him. "My heart is so restless," "I can't live a moment without you." "Let's just melt into each other," "embrace me oh dear." "This unexpected fire in me," "makes me so anxious." "I have wasted my body and soul," "just for you, my dear." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Unknowingly my body trembles in your presence." "And I yearn for your sweet fragrance." "My love for your innocent emotions, makes my heart feel a bit shy... " "...yet seeing you, my eyes bloom with joy." "This unexpected fire in me," "makes me so anxious." "I have wasted my body and soul," "just for you, my dear." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." Brother! -Ganya? -Is everything okay? Yes, okay... Anna is reaching. What? Okay! Nisha, come, let's go... You leave... -Let her wait here. -What? Just for an hour... What nonsense are you talking? Anna liked her... This is the first time Anna has asked me for something. Ganya! Hey, move aside... Satya... Nisha! Anna... Please let her go... Satya... Please don't harm her Anna... Satya... Anna... Please leave her... Let her go. Satya... -Anna, I beg of you... Please let her go. -Hey, take him away... Ganya, you called me brother, didn't you? Please ask Anna to stop this... Get out... Hey catch him... Don't dare to touch me. Move! Let's go Nisha... Move away... Anna... are you okay? Are you hurt Anna? Go get him now... Let's go... Hey, is this the time to come home? Just tell them I am not around... Why? I will explain... Namaskar... Sir... Namaskar! Satya, is he home? He is not around. He was with you, right? Yes... correct... Please call me, once he is back... -Okay... -Let's go... What's all this? Bhaskar Anna's men were chasing her, so, I got her with me. Who is she? What mom meant to you, she means to me. Go, drop her home... Did you get my point? Her friend circle is not good. You have no clue about her. The boys in this locality, are all louts. They will try to get close to her in the guise of helping her... then they will take undue advantage, and your daughter will get pregnant. You know what I mean... Here, purse... I found this in my office. I know you are quite broad minded. Not everyone is like you... In this town, such humiliating news gets broadcasted in a jiffy. Nisha is like my sister... Hence, here I am, to alert you. Let me know, if you need any help. And sir... please don't reprimand Nisha... She is quite soft hearted... Take care... Okay, I'll take your leave. Sister. Dad... Dad... You are misusing your freedom... -Dad, that Bhaskar... -Just shut up! -Papa, I... -Not a word... You are grounded... Dad, listen to me please... Dad! Hey... get out of here... What are you staring at? Get out man! Sir, Please hear me out... Sir... Nisha! I caught the captain red-handed, fixing a match. I realized you were innocent. I am sorry! The day after tomorrow, we have the final 'Railway team' selection. I have recommended your name, so, don't miss it. Satya, do you realize how important this is? Sir, I will get him... I assure you. Great... I will see you on field. Yes... Sir, please listen to me... I said just go... Nisha... -Get lost from here... -Nisha! Leave me... Satya's hanging around, outside my house, is quite embarrassing. Threaten him if needed, and move him out. Don't be too harsh... Okay! Captain says, just threaten and let him off. I suggest, finish him off. Satya... Quick, get inside the car. Catch him, don't let him go... Be quick... Nisha... May I know, what are you up to? Bhaskar's men were out there to kill you. Bhaskar is responsible for my father's misunderstanding... I need to clear it all... Please stay inside... I want to meet your father too. What if you are attacked by Bhaskar's men, if you step out? Listen to me please, just stay indoors, until tomorrow. I have my cricket selection in the evening. Selectors will be there for that. Satya, what's more important to you, cricket or me? Both are equally important. Satya... Listen, let's clear this air, once for all, after that, I promise you... we will always be together. Take care. Don't leave. Wait for me. What if you are attacked by Bhaskar's men, if you step out? Satya, what's more important to you, Cricket or me? Please wait inside... I promise you... we will always be together. Wait for me... Brother... Bhaskar's men are troubling your wife... Hey! Move back. Get lost. Anna... Anna... Hey... what's your name? I asked, what's your name? His name is 'Satya'. I am his father. Sonavane Sir, see how badly he has trashed him... Show him the wounds. What nonsense is this? But as per their complaint, your men triggered the fight. These boys? Sir, how is that possible? They are all social activists. Why would they do such hooliganism? They are all innocents... Sir, you have mistaken... What do you mean? Sir, this Angry Bird here, is quite hot tempered... He has not forgotten his girlfriend... He boozes and troubles people for his miseries... Did you get my point? So did your men misbehave with his girlfriend? No, sir, she is not his girlfriend. She is his wife... My daughter-in-law. She is the victim, right? Bring her here... Let's hear her version. Your name? Shravani. Is he yout husband? Did they misbehave with you? Sawant Ma'am... Please record her statement. Sir, they have filed a cross complaint too... So, your son too will be detained here tonight. if this is going to inconvenience my husband. then, I don't want to lodge a complaint, May I... ? No! Why? Not needed... Who is not needed? Your wife? or your father? Can I get some tea for you? There she goes again... I knew, you will change the topic. Why do you always try to protect him? You have been married for so long... Did you even bother to speak sweetly to her? ... or took her out somewhere? Do you wish to go somewhere? Just send me away once and for all. He always asks me out... I have been declining all the time. Look dear, please don't think, I am not aware of the reality. -Shravani... -There he is... Welcome... Here, some fresh mango pulp for you... This is just for you. Okay, give some to your father-in-law. Okay, give a spoonful to your husband too. Okay, give it all to your dear husband, pour it on his head, for all I care. Please sit, Murli... We avoid even having water at our daughter's in-law's place... How about some tea? Sure, only if it's made without water. Don't you understand? I asked you to deliver this file to our Head Office. Why is it still lying here? Come over here... It's been a month, these papers are just lying around. I want them organized right now. She is always tongue tied in front of her husband, But throws her weight around in the office. I don't know what her problem is? I don't like to gossip at work! That's my problem... Now, do you know what your problem is? The sari your husband gifted you, was bought at 'Buy one and get two free' offer. Do you know where the other two saris are? Everyone in this office is well aware of it... except you... This is your problem... She always speaks nonsense. Pooja Ma'am, this file is... Good morning, sir... Looks like you all shopped at the same shop... That's such an amazing camaraderie... Great... Shravani... meet me in my cabin please. Please come dear, -Please sit down... -Good morning, sir... I know you were unwell, I have drafted all your letters, please do check them... I wasn't unwell... -What? -Keep it low... What? I was out on a trip... -A trip? -Silence... My wife loves ocean. So, I went with her to Goa... on our second honeymoon... -Second honeymoon? -Keep it low... Don't scream and announce it to the world. Obviously not sir... So... Where did you go for your honeymoon? We? Err... -Actually... -What? Ours was a destination wedding. -Is it? -Yes. A destination wedding? So we extended our stay over there. Unbelievable... that's so nice to have a destination wedding. Where was this destination? My husband is fond of ice... -Ice? -Yes... So we went to Manali... Manali? Manali! Such a nice place... Whoa! It's been so many years, you never introduced your husband to me... Do get him over sometime... Okay! Ma'am... Your husband is here... This is pure coincidence... This indeed is pure love... You remembered your husband, and he is right here. Pandurang... Go get her husband inside... tell him, I want to meet him... No! I forgot to mention... He is here to collect our housekeys from me. I am sure he is busy... This is pure love... How come you are here? Yes... I am here... Actually, I was over there... I saw this board, and now I am over here. So, this is our station. No, it belongs to the government... That's what I meant... The government is also ours. I mean, it was, sometime back. Okay, I will take your leave then... Did you call me over? No... -No? -No... Sorry... Yesterday, while washing your clothes, I found this in your shirt pocket. You sure? This is mine? Are you sure? Yes... I supported the Kings XI team for Yuvraj, he quit to join the Sunrisers... When I started to cheer for Sunrisers, He jumped over to the Pune team... When I sported the Pune team's t-shirt... The team vanished... I am glad I didn't wear the team's official pants. Hello... Yes sir... Yes... Okay... Sure, I will talk to him... Coach was on phone with me... Again... He has been asking you to join since last two years, Why aren't you meeting him? Satya... He wants to appoint you as a 'Coach'... How long are you going to drink yourself silly in her memory? Whether I am drinking to remember her or to forget her... I have no clue. Is it that difficult to open your mouth and speak up? I am not interested in talking to him... ask him, is this his hobby to get drunk and create a ruckus outside my house? Tell your dear husband... This is... my gate... Lakshmi... ask him to read the name plate... (Shri. Murli P Shinde...) He has put up his name plate on my gate, how sick is that? Please ask him... Are you out of your head, man? The adjoining property is yours... [Shri. Dinkar Jadhav.] Hey... Aren't you ashamed to get drunk and create such ruckus? What ruckus are you talking about? Say it... Did I abuse you? You Idiot, stupid... good for nothing... Did I ever speak such truth? There you go... I am glad you said it... You ruined your father's life... now you are out to destroy my daughter's life. Do I physically abuse her? or have I kept her imprisoned in my house? She is happy and enjoying her life. Yes of course, at her own expense... You good for nothing, drunkard... Aren't you ashamed living off your wife's earnings? -Father! -Stop it... Don't ever speak to my husband so rudely. Why do you interfere in my family affairs? You should be talking to him, not me. He is good for nothing, a loser... Dad! Enough, I don't want another word against my husband. I am fully aware of his whereabouts. You are responsible for this mess, you have been encouraging this sick behavior. We will take care of our affairs... You don't have to interfere... I am your father. Did you hear what she said... I wish I was dead... -Who stopped you man! -What did he say? Oh, okay... Okay... fine... Dad, please don't. -I will set myself on fire... -What are you up to? Dad please... What are you up to? -Go get a matchbox... -Dad, please stop... -You thew a matchbox at me? -Dad, please stop... Mom, please take him inside... Did you see his behavior? See what a great son-in-law I have... Go sleep now everyone... This is our family issue. I am sorry... Let's go inside. Seventy thousand five hundred and eighty only... The amount I owe you. But I never... One of us need to maintain an account. Why did you marry me? "When I lost my heart to you," "I was just an adolescent." "Don't think I erred... " "... yet I gave in." "Things that seemed normal," "were just an illusion." "I kept looking for something," "which was never meant to be mine." "Do not look for me," "I am but your shadow." "You are the reason, for my existence. " "I sought your attention," "I expressed my love," "you neither heard, nor understood." "I am dissonant... " "... You are my harmony." "I am dissonant... " "... You are my harmony." "I feel incomplete... " "... and you are nowhere near me." "I am dissonant... " "... You are my harmony." "I am dissonant... " "The void between us deepened," "yet the bond remained unbroken." "Though you failed to notice me," "I could never take my eyes off you." "Our match was made in heaven," "but our hearts failed to connect." "The unending questions in my mind," "always went unanswered" "The earth yearns to unite with the sky," "though impossible, yet they embrace at the horizon." "I accepted my fate," "accepted you as my God," "I prayed for you, I worshiped you." "But... I am dissonant... " "... You are my harmony." "I am dissonant... " "... You are my harmony." "I feel incomplete... " "... and you are nowhere near me." "I am dissonant... " "... You are my harmony." "I am dissonant... " "I left everything for you... " "Now I beg of you with folded hands... " "... will you please be mine?" "I feel devastated," "with no control over my emotions," "I want to be with you, will you accept me ever?" "I am dissonant... " "I loved you madly," "yet I feel rejected." "I am dissonant... " "I accepted everything," "always with a smile." "I am dissonant... " "For years I yearned for you," "never gave up." "I am dissonant... " "I lived dreaming," "only about you." "I am dissonant... " "You are my harmony." "I am dissonant... " "You are my harmony." "I am dissonant... " Uncle... suffered a heart attack yesterday... These are his reports... I will make sure he takes his medication. I want to marry Satya... I will never allow you to marry him. I am not asking you, I am letting you know my decision. He has been boozing and wasting his life over some girl. He failed to save his love... Let me protect mine... I will allow this wedding only over my dead body... Okay then, be prepared for lose your daughter. Listen... My daughter has lost her senses. She says, she will commit suicide if I don't let her marry Satya. I don't know what's worse, to die or to marry Satya. Mr. Dinkar... Please accept my proposal... For how long do you intend to live under your father's care? He is worried about you... Do you want him to die with your worries? Instead of doing ten things to appease his soul after his death... ... while he is alive, just do one thing... ... accept Shravani's proposal. "After meeting you," "I felt as if... " "... the desires of my heart has been fulfilled." "O my faithful beloved." "Together we both are one life." Hello, uncle Akbar... I am good... How have you been? How's your Salim? What, is he worried? That's obvious... You are such an irresponsible father, Akbya... Aren't you worried about his future? Listen to me... Don't entomb him alive... He is capable of boozing there as well. What? From where does he get money for alcohol? Your daughter-in-law... silly! He lives off her earnings. Aunty Jodha! How have you been? What, you went to the village, all alone? Uncle Akbar misses you a lot. And he takes out his frustrations on poor Salim. Aunty Jodha... can I tell you something? What if, your husband Akbar, listens to Anu? Yes, Anu is Anarkali, his daughter-in-law. What if he starts listening to her? He will feel less troubled. Sallu and Anu will manage their lives Why should he interfere in their personal matters? Stop it I say... Hang up the phone. Hey Satya... Here, take this one... this shirt is properly ironed. Whoa... Sister Jodha... Err... I mean, Saraswati... I feel restrained because of my promise to you.. else, I would've smashed your son to pulp by now. Dad... -Dad... -Yes? Dad, I do understand what you are going through. I feel... we should try to understand his feelings too. We've been doing that all along. And for how long should we put up with him? Will he ever change? is there any guarantee? Guarantees are meant for appliances, not for relationships... I am connected to him as well. I love him too... You are his father... Your love also has ownership. How do you tolerate his behavior? Dad, you feel his drinking should lessen. I feel his troubles should lessen. It's as simple as that... Your goodness is beyond my imagination. I taught him to walk, and today he loses his balance because of alcohol. and helplessly we just have to watch him fall. A father's expectations are shattered, you won't understand my pain, Shravani. At least love is the reason for your angst for each other. I get nothing from him, neither love nor anger. You will never understand the pain of loving someone. Who never loved you back. Boys... never underestimate the power of liquor. It understands, if you are drinking to celebrate, or boozing to lessen your pain. It understands our emotions. Bhaskar Anna... He has not uttered a word against you. Neither did I complain... But Jonty, my anger is... ... justified. Our country lost a great player, I was very hopeful to see him... ... play for our national team. Now look at him... always hanging around at cheap bars. Jonty, stop living at wife's expense man... Angry bird... put their drinks on my tab. Call up our coach. Why do you have to shine his bike, everyday? Does even bother to use it? He will... You should've given him cash instead, at least he would've used it more effectively. Don't worry, I will use it... Of course... Not! This belongs to him. Whoa... So please... tell your dear husband... to keep his hands off my scooter. along with liquor... He guzzles down my fuel too... Gosh! she is angry... I am glad I was at a safe distance, I saved myself from her wrath. My foot! You think he'll moving out? Satya? You fool... What's up? Don't you have any manners? Are you off to sell some household items for your alcohol? We are off to New Delhi. Ah, I am so glad to see you accompany him... What's the purpose? Err... He has been appointed as a coach for the under 14 team. And finally, he has accepted the offer. Coaching? Wait a minute... Couldn't you open your mouth and speak? I suggest, you take your wife along. I am going on an assignment, not for picnic. -You... -Hold on... Also, I won't get any leaves at such a short notice. -But... -Hold this please... Hey... What's going on? Good luck! Job! Delhi! Coaching! Thank God, he finally landed a job. Are you crazy? I am sure, liquor must be cheap over there he must've gone to buy some booze. Welcome to the academy, Satya... I am so glad, finally, you accepted my offer. Thank you sir. See, coaching has a great future. And I know your caliber. You could've been a great player. But now you have an opportunity to create a great player. Right? Sir, thank you so much for remembering him, for this position. Hey watch... Good, now rotate the batsman... Khushi, you are next... Yes... Oh my God. Maharashtra's girl in Delhi? Next. Good... Now show me forward defence. Next... Good shot! Show me forward defence! Lean front and play, okay? Forward defence! Don't you understand? Can't you hear what I say? I will defend if the ball is worth defending... Pull up you bowler first... not me. Come on, deliver the next... Out... Step out... You are benched! What? You can't play the next match. Satya, she is a good player. I know sir... We need to control her aggression. Such directionless aggression is pointless. Coach... Hello, Mr. Kumar. Did you bench my granddaughter? Yes... She is the best player in the team. So why is she not playing? She is a fabulous player... But she is too aggressive, and that's her problem. It's our new coach's decision, to bench her, at least for one match. It'll be good for her. Who is the new coach? Coach! What did you achieve by separating us? Why did you ruin our lives? You have no clue what I went through. Nisha abandoned me 12 years ago, and I am still waiting for her where she left me. I don't know why? But I know for a fact that, Nisha can never be happy without me. She should be alive, to be happy. That night, we left everything behind, and moved to Delhi. Nisha could never get you out of her mind. Later, I faked some documents, to prove to her that Bhaskar had killed you. A few years later, I married her off to Kunal. Since then, she stopped talking to me. Years later, she gave birth to a baby girl. And then started living for her daughter. But God had different plans for her. A few years ago... Nisha and Kunal met with an accident... And we lost both of them. This morning, the girl you reprimanded, Khushi, she is Nisha's daughter. Cricket is... Khushi's life... It was Nisha's dream... to see Khushi as a cricketer. I never got an opportunity to apologize to Nisha. But here, I apologize to you... I am sorry. Mr. Kumar, I feel it's the right decision, to move Khushi out of her comfort zone. She needs isolated training. We are running out of time. We hardly have a month, to prepare her for the Delhi under 14 tournament. Think about it. If Satya agrees to this, you have my consent too. Kumar, how could you do this to me? I called you here, to set this cranky guy straight, how dare you send me with him for personal coaching? You trust me, right? No! Bye! Thank you for this. Hey... Who the hell are you? What do you want? One clean room... Hey, where are you going? Who is she? Which one is my room... You take the corner room... I don't share my room with strangers. I don't even share the room with the person I am supposed to. Why is she going inside? Who is she? Can't you introduce her? He doesn't care to speak up... Saraswati... what the hell is going on? Are you going to open your mouth? She is Khushi... Nisha's daughter. Nisha's daughter? Nisha? You mean, your ex? Have you lost your mind? Why did you bring her daughter here? Forget me... You should've thought about your wife at least. What's there for dinner today? Oh God... This is so unhealthy... Okra fry, 225 Cal, Potato, cumin seeds, 125 Cal. Royal Cottage Cheese, 375 Calories... I want to be a cricketer, not a weight lifter... Hey, have you informed your parents about your visit here? -Dinkar! -Hey! -Chill, -What do you mean? -Chill... -Okay... My parents are gone... Where? To meet your wife, Saraswati. I can't eat this... I need to call Kumar. Should I cook something of your choice? No! Okay! How's it? Too good... But this is quite high on calories. Do you have some extra? I have an extra spoon. That's fine. Is my coach, your husband? I feel sad for you. Give him some time, I am sure you will realize, how lucky you are, to get such a coach. For how many years have you been married? Seven. In which year did you realize, you are lucky, to get a husband like him? Is Khushi ready? Err... sending her right away... Good morning. Looks like, these days, the wine shops open early in the morning. Who is that little girl with him? She? His friend... she is Khushi, his friend's daughter. He is coaching her. She will go back in 8 to 10 days... She is his friend's daughter after all. Dad... Khushi... is Nisha's daughter, I know the truth. Oh my God... She knew it! Hey... are you hawking used vegetables? Who are you? Who the hell are you? Hey! don't you have any manners? And is that how you talk to kids? Hey... Come over here... I am Murli... So? I am Shravani's father... Oh! Good for you... bye. Wait... come back... Who are you? -I am Khushi... -Khushi! What are you doing here? Satya is my new cricket coach. Oh dear... there are so many super talented coaches in the world, why did you get pick this guy? Murli... There are so many great grooms in the world... yet you chose him for your girl. Wait! "After meeting you," "I felt as if the desires of my heart have been fulfilled." Khushi! Hey Khushi... Listen dear... Khushi... What are you doing? This is my mother's favorite song. Come, listen to this one. It's his Walkman... So? I found it there, so I took it... He won't like it. I'll keep it back. Why do you interfere in my affairs? Err. I was keeping it where it belongs... You want everything where it belongs, is it? What do you intend to prove? That you are a noble soul! Okay, I agree, you are a great soul... So, please! Just stay away from me and my affairs. I took your Walkman. She told me you won't like it. Sorry... It's okay dear. "Hey, brother what's wrong with you," "please tell me now." "Whatever it is, forget it, you too are getting old, so stop now." "Hey, brother what's wrong with you," "please tell me now." "Whatever it is, forget it, you too are getting old, so stop now." "I know someone troubled you," "broke your heart," "pained you from within..." "How didn't you feel it?" "My heart has gone crazy," "shocked beyond belief," "troubled and pained," "always drunk, and blabbered nonsense." "I am so crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She made me go crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "I am so crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She made me go crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She speaks so sweet..." "... her words are sweeter than sugar." "And whatever she speaks," "she can never be challenged." "She never flared at me," "never cried because of me," "She is a darling," "yet I failed to connect with her." "Only lucky few are blessed with such a life partner... "But you are such a fool to ignore her." "Blame your ego for this loss." "You are going crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She made me go crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "I am so crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She made me go crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "I wish I could foretell your future," "but I have no time now..." "Change your attitude," "as love is not a game." "Just lovingly take her hand, and don't let her go, brother." "Don't ever be like me." "I have ruined my love life, just like you..." "And here, I explained to you, what love is, in such easy words." "You are going crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She made you go crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "I am going crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "She made me go crazy, crazy, crazy for her." "Brother..." "She's simply awesome." I see the bat has replaced the alcohol bottle? What made him rekindle his old forgotten passion? The girl is from Delhi... I hear... Who is she? Find out now... One scoop Vanilla... Add one more for her... Sure. Hello, dear Khushi... How are you? Did you recognise me? Just one scoop for me. -Just one. -No, I don't know you. Nisha... I am her friend, Bhaskar... Didn't she tell you about me? -Your mother? -No! I know you are irritated with Satya, right? Just like your mother... What do you mean? Didn't he mention anything to you about your mom? ?? Of course, how will he admit he is a cheater? They had an affair... Satya... Satya... Satya... Satya... Satya stop it... Satya stop it. Stop it. You knew my mother? You knew my mother? Were you in a relationship? Who broke up? My mother, or you? Did you torture my mother, just like you torture Shravani? I am sure, my mom dumped you... Good... She would've never been happy with someone like you. And one fine day, Nisha left Satya, forever... What happens when someone you love, leaves you forever, for no reason... ? I am sure you know it well. Satya always dreamt... to play for the 'Railways' team... and then represent our country. He was mad about only two things in life... Nisha... and cricket. She left him... And he quit playing. What about Shravani? Just the way we all err in life... God makes mistakes too... Unfortunately, God doesn't come to apologize... He makes good by sending a noble soul to look after us. That's Shravani... Hey Satya... I am sorry... It's okay... Smile please... A little more... Little more... Litter more... Sir, this is just not possible Shravani... a promotion, and transfer to Nagpur, is a great opportunity for you. I know it, sir... You try it for two years, and come back if it doesn't suit you. You will get my profile when you come back. I am happy the way I am... Shravani... Nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity. And that's exactly what I don't want to miss... an opportunity. Khushi... Delhi under 14 selection process is about to start. We have 2 weeks to prepare. But I want to represent the 'Railways' team. What? I want to represent the 'Railways' team. What are you talking? Being a part of the Delhi team, will get you great opportunities. I am sure... but I still want to represent the 'Railways' team. Look, I am your coach. I will decide what's right for you and what's not. Delhi under 14. That's it. Either Railway... or no cricket. Is she not ready yet, for the training? She has had a fever since last night. Railways or no cricket... Khushi is a fool... how can she represent the 'Railways' team? how is that possible? For that, one of her parents should be employed at the Railways. Like Shravani who works for the Railways... Now, let's assume... You and Shravani decide to adopt Khushi... Maybe she can represent the 'Railways' team. Adopt her... I am not suggesting that... I will never ask you to... Adopt her! That's too hot... Sorry... Err... while washing your clothes, I found this in your shirt pocket. I was wearing a t-shirt, yesterday... Perhaps... I found it in your trouser pocket. Forget it... I have something very important to discuss. I have made up my mind... (Please... Not divorce... Not divorce...) It's about Khushi... What? Adopt? You want to adopt Khushi? Has he started boozing in the mornings too? Did you ask Shravani... I like Khushi... Have you too started boozing with him in the mornings? And what about... the rich... granddad? Did you discuss with him? Satya... I want to have a word with Shravani. He wants to talk to you. Shravani... I am very sorry. I've always succumbed to Khushi's demands. Sometimes, our contentment is in giving into the demands of our loved ones. If required, I will take her with me, after the selection process. You don't have to stick to this arrangement. Please don't worry. I will take care of her as my own daughter. Shravani... I am sure, even Nisha, wouldn't have done something like this. Your one decision, has given us each a daughter. You both have decided to adopt me... and has Kumar agreed to it. We will try to be good parents. Okay, I don't mind. But before trying to be good parents... first, try to be good husband and wife. Then we will see... That ends her cricketing career. -Good night... -Khushi... Khushi is quite adamant... She is forcing me to sleep with you... I mean, in the same room. But today Dad is not around, I will sleep in his room... Hello Akbar, I reached home safely... Now I will settle in my room and watch 'Mughal-e-Azam' movie. I will sleep in the living room. I will be watching the first half sitting in my room, and the second half in the living room. I will find a place to sleep, you don't bother. No need... you may sleep in my room. "I offered, I sacrificed," "I surrendered myself to you," "and I experienced... " "Yes... I experienced... " "This bond from our past lives," "This happiness of being with you," "I finally experienced it today." "It's so beautiful." "It's such a different day, today." "It's so enchanting." "This crazy heart of mine, yearns more of this." "Finally I know what real happiness is." "The joy of being with my true love." "Here, we are finally connected." "Finally I know what real happiness is." "The joy of being with my true love." "Here, we are finally connected." "This divine touch... " "feels so heavenly." "My dreams... " "have come true." "The relation I had with you," "now has a meaning." "Now I know the real meaning of our vows." "This day has finally made me feel, like your beloved life partner." "Finally I know what real happiness is." "I don't know how this happened," "yet the joy of being with my true love is so unreal." "Finally I know what real happiness is." "I don't know how this happened," "yet the joy of being with my true love is so unreal." Shravani, did you perform this ritual, during your wedding? Let's go check that out... "I prayed, to have you as my partner for seven lives." "Here, I wish I live this moment forever." "I feel so complete, with you right next to me." "This bond, this fragrance of love," "should never go out of my life." What? 50 rupees for this? Dad, this kid Khushi... we have adopted her... She is Nisha's daughter. I know... She is cute... just like her name... From here on, you call me granddad. -Do you understand? -Okay Murli. That works too... Thank you! "yet the joy of being with my true love is so unreal." Congratulations! Why don't you coach our 'Railways' team? Yes! Khushi... Khushi... Yes. Champion! Khushi... Oh my God, Khushi... You are too good. Hey, Khushi... wait. -Satya... -What's the fare? Khushi was fantastic today, I am sure she will get selected. She is far better than other players. She is too good. Please drop them home, I will join you later. Satya, please don't... Everything is fine now, don't mess it up. Please go home. Yes... True... Let's leave... Where is he? He has some important work to attend... He asked us to leave. -Oh, okay... -Come. Sorry... I am late... There was a call from the association, There were some pending formalities pertaining to Khushi's selection, to be completed. The authorities are all impressed with her performance. They feel she has the spark to be a part of the National team. Everything is possible when you are with her. She will get selected for sure. It's not just because of me... It's... because of us. Everything seems so different from the time she is with us. I mean... in the last few days, whatever is happening between us, It's all fake... This façade is just for Khushi's sake. I have not forgotten anything. I know, you don't want me around. I know it very well, we had to bond, just for the sake of Khushi. Spend time together in one room. I feel she is settled now. We can now stop acting in front of her. You can go back to your old self. I am used to it anyway. Shravani... Shravani dear... What's wrong with you? Everything is falling in place now... and why are you suddenly relocating to Nagpur? You won't understand. I've been promoted... should I just refuse the offer? You don't have to go... Just tender your resignation. Firstly, I was never in favour of you marrying him. Now I just don't agree to your decision of moving out of this house. Are you really moving out? Am I so bad, that you are leaving me behind? No dear... Then why do you have to go? Look, I will be in touch with you, Also, soon your granddad will take you home. I don't want to go with him. I want to be with you. Please don't go, mom! When did you get to know about your transfer? Yesterday! Last week, I heard from your boss, you refused the offer then... and now suddenly you are leaving. What changed in a week? Do you really have to go? Do you even know me? We've been married for seven years now. I vividly remember each day of our life. Do you even... recollect a single moment? When I was a kid, a boy shattered our window glass. I peeped out of my window, and could never take my eyes off him. It wasn't just a ball that entered my house through the window. That's when this young boy came into my life. He changed my life completely. I followed him everywhere. I became his shadow. As I grew... I realised... This madness is called... Love! My life became all about him, and I didn't even fleetingly feature in his thoughts. But I was happy, because it was the truth. He was in love with someone else. I accepted it... because it was the truth. Years later, I adamantly married him... but I could never be his wife. I accepted it... because it was the truth. In the last few days, we lived like one happy family. I was living my dream. But, but... yesterday... I saw him enter the hotel... And I realised... everything that I thought real... was in fact, a lie. And this lie is troubling me. I know I am at the wrong platform. However long I wait, I will never be able to board the right train. Enough now... I came to bid you goodbye, before we part ways. Didn't I tell you? either one of us should maintain the account. I went to the hotel, to bid goodbye to my past... ... forever. Shravani, I may have erred... but I was never a liar. I knew, I have you... I took you for granted. She was always there to support, when I boozed and lost my balance. For everyone who abused me, she fought with them, for me. I attempted to end my life, she was there again, to save my life. What you thought was fake, indeed was all real. Every moment was real, just the way it is now. This is the first time you are leaving me all alone. You fell in love, so did I... There is madness in you... ... and in me too. Some madly fall in love... And some... are the madness, in love. The only difference is... You loved me... And I started loving you. I... I love you, Shravani. What if I still want to go? It's okay... It's perfectly fine... ... as I will be your shadow, from now on. You were not waiting at the wrong platform. This (me) train got a bit delayed, "One was passionate, crazy in love..." "And the other became crazy in love but never so knew..." "The one who blossomed in love... just dried and wilted away" "but the one that Shrivelled didn't lose hope in love... " "This yearning is sure sweet..." "The final longing or a new beginning..." "It is your bright heart That has illuminated mine..." You are not leaving, right? I can't... This is a goods train! "I finally experienced the real happiness today." "I don't know how this happened," "yet the joy of being with my true love is so unreal." "My heart is so restless," "I can't live a moment without you." "Let's just melt into each other," "embrace me oh dear." "This unexpected fire in me," "makes me so anxious." "I have wasted my body and soul," "just for you, my dear." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Unknowingly my body trembles in your presence." "And I yearn for your sweet fragrance." "My love for your innocent emotions, makes my heart feel a bit shy... " "...yet seeing you, my eyes bloom with joy." "This unexpected fire in me," "makes me so anxious." "I have wasted my body and soul," "just for you, my dear." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for." "Madness for you, makes this distance unbearable." "Madness for you, makes me crave for your innocent love" "Madness for you, is the reason I live for."
