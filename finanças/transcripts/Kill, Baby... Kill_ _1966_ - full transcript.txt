No! No! Help... help! Are you still going into town, doctor? You see that's how one gets greeted in the village. Death rules here. If I may, please give me 50 crowns. I am sorry, but I cannot go on from here. Sorry, I gave you a ride to this place, because I needed the money. The inn is further ahead, after that arch. It won't be difficult for you to find it. Just ask for directions, it's the only inn in town. You see this is a condemned place, a God forgotten place. Nobody ever comes to this place. You better come back, doctor, before it is too late. I am looking for the inn. Can you tell me where it is? It's over there. I'm looking for the inspector. Inspector Kruger. You are the doctor, aren't you? In this village, we never liked doctors. Quiet! Dr. Eswai? Yes! Come. Come. The inspector is waiting for you. Enough! I said I know nothing about Irene Hollander. I didn't know her, inspector! You, too, know nothing, haven't seen or heard anything? You all have the same answer! Look, you can't fool me! Why such reluctance? What keeps your tongue tied? Is it fear maybe? Fear from what? Tell me! From what? An amulet! An amulet! That's what's keeping you from talking. It's superstition, ignorance. But, I will get you to talk! So that you will tell me what happened, you'll see! You made it. I was getting worried about you. I left immediately, but it wasn't easy getting here, Inspector Kruger. We are isolated from the world here, nobody ever comes to see us. This is Mr. Keirr, the burgomeister. Go, but wait with the others downstairs. Have you lived here for a while, Inspector? I arrived here the other day. I asked for you to come here for a very serious matter. Take a look at this letter. It's from Irena Hollander, a girl who worked as a housekeeper at a villa. The villa of the Baroness Graps. I can't resist it anymore. I have decided to talk, to break the cycle of death... a great burden to me. Come soon, because this time it feels like it's my turn. Irena Hollander. That letter came to the police station... and I came here to check what was indeed true. The girl, unfortunately, was already dead. Impaled by the spears of a gate. A homicide! I still don't know. They keep wanting me to believe that it is a curse. But this letter makes me think about something totally different. But it will be up to you to figure it out, doctor. You'll have to do an autopsy. Burgomeister, we'll continue with the interview tomorrow. Nobody can leave! Have you figured something out, Inspector? I keep hitting a wall of silence. They are afraid, of everything. They are afraid of my questions, it's as if they are being terrorized by something. On the other hand, I understand their distrust towards strangers. You are without doubt the first authority who has made it to this place. Their only belief system is superstition. Earlier, they were carrying a casket... A casket? When? When I arrived. I think I get it now. They are trying to prevent an autopsy on Irena Hollander! Come with me, doctor, quickly! Rufus, Argo! Stop! What are you doing? Who told you to bury her? Wasn't I clear enough? The doctor came for the very purpose of doing an autopsy! It's against the law of nature to touch the dead. Take her to the mortuary. When can you start? Right away. But a qualified witness is needed. There are guidelines I have to follow. I told you to move the corpse inside, immediately! As to the witness, don't worry. I'll send you... Inspector! Inspector! The burgomeister sent me! He wants you to come back to the inn. He couldn't keep the people you were trying to interview. He wants to talk to you immediately! Okay, I am coming. Go do what you have to do. Once you're done, come join me. All right. Mr. Keirr! Mr. Keirr! Why have they all left? I am sorry! But there was nothing I could do about it. I tried to keep them here for the interrogation. But once they found out that you had gone to the cemetery, they ran away. Evidently you don't have much power over these people. Well, it's not a matter of power. Inspector, I beg you! Stop the autopsy! I have to solve this case! Listen to me! You must not let the body of Irena Hollander be touched. I was hoping that you would cooperate with me. I see that you are siding with them, to hide the truth. No! No, Inspector! I made you come back, to explain to you... the village does not speak, not to cover up something... but out of fear. I am not ashamed to admit that I am afraid... about what may happen to me... if I reveal... the secret of Villa Graps. Villa Graps? It sounds like an impossible story, something above the laws of nature. It will be difficult for you to believe me. But the death of Irena Hollander... is not due to an accident. It is murder! Are you Dr. Eswai? I am Monica Schuftan. The Inspector sent me to assist you. I was actually looking for a physician. I am a science student from Grottenburg. I am the only one here who will be useful to you. So, you are from the village? Yes, I was born there. But I have gone since I was one year old. I returned on the same day this girl died. Have you ever attended an autopsy? No, never. That's incredible! They slipped a coin into her heart! Just like the legend says. It's an old legend, which has been circulating around here for centuries. It says that only a coin in the heart would bring peace... to those whose lives ended violently. In spite of the autopsy, we are unable to conclude... whether we are talking about an accident or a suicide. Oh, that coin! Who could have slipped it into the heart of that poor girl? And why? Don't worry about it, Monica. Inspector Kruger will clear up everything. I am here now, this is where I live. I am Mrs. Morano's guest. I don't mean to be intrusive, but why did you come back to this village? I came back to visit my parents' graves. I never knew them. They left me with a small fund, which I lived off before going to college. Thank you for telling me. You have been really brave. Thanks. I wish you a good night, doctor. Good night, Monica. I already told you, doctor, not to touch the dead. He who touches them has to pay with his life. We had to, we had to bury that girl! Why didn't you do that? Stop it! Doctor! Doctor, the inspector went to Villa Graps because of an emergency. He left an hour ago and left you a note in his room. Didn't he say when he would be back? Nobody ever makes it back from Villa Graps. Why are you saying this? I didn't say that. I didn't say that. It's not true. Stay away. Go to your room right away. Dinner is ready. No! No! No! Not me! I didn't say anything, I didn't say a thing! Darling, what's happening to you? At the window! Did you see her? Oh my God, that's terrible! Now that she is scared, there's no more hope! Only Ruth can do something. Go and get her! Quickly, hurry! You were looking for me, right? I could feel that you needed me. Dear Eswai... the burgomeister revealed things to me that I find unbelievable. I am heading to Villa Graps to meet the Baroness... to inquire about something important. Join me there as soon as you can. Sincerely, Inspector Kruger. Calm down, girl. It won't happen to you. The curse will not touch you. Get her undressed. Blood! Strengthen yourself. Death will not touch you. Stay away, stay far away from the Villa. Stay far away! Stay away! Stay away! I heard her. She's here! It's because I opened my mouth! Don't say that, darling daughter! I tell you, I heard her! This will protect you. You can never take it off. I am done now. No, no, go out this way. They cannot see you. I helped her pay her bill. Why did you exorcise this girl? You can help me here. You certainly must know a lot about this village. Why do people seek help in your magical skills? What are they afraid of? There is a terrible curse hovering over these people. Be careful, you, too, are in danger. Irena Hollander was thrown to her death. But, by what? Leave, doctor! Those are things that science cannot explain. Give the inspector a warning right away. Send him away as well. And stop this investigation. Inspector Kruger is at Villa Graps to wrap up the interrogation. He is a practical and driven man. He doesn't get influenced by imagination. He will get to the bottom of the matter. Where is the Villa? I'd like to join the inspector. Don't go, doctor. Don't go there. I mean it. They talk about this villa with such terror... as if even afraid to say its name. It's something I need to clarify. Villa Graps is over there. Wait a moment. You can't tell me anything about this coin either? I found it today inside Irena Hollander's heart. I was hoping that you would help me understand. I already told you that I know nothing. Go ahead, if you wish. But still not too late for you to choose not to go. Thank you. I hope we will meet again. If he ever makes it back from that villa. Keirr, my love. What's the matter, Keirr? And there is another one. It is a mortal chain this one, and it will never break! Death rules at Villa Graps. Yes, there is death. It can be stopped only by death itself. Leave now, Keirr. We have to call the hearse right away. You know the dirt has to cover the body immediately before the sun rises. With its weight, the dirt embraces the dead... and keeps it in the earth forever. They won't take you with them. You will be at peace. Kruger! Inspector Kruger! What do you want? Excuse me, I am looking for Mr. Kruger, the inspector. There is no inspector. But I was told that he came to see Baroness Graps. I am the Baroness Graps. And nobody ever comes here. I am alone here in this villa. Leave! No, wait! Leave! It's for your own good! Leave me alone! Hi. What's your name? Melissa! My name is Melissa. Melissa? Melissa! Oh no, no! No, no, no! Mrs. Morano, I beg you! Mrs. Morano! What do you want? Open up! Mrs. Morano, I am afraid! Open up, I beg you! Go away! What goes around comes around. You shouldn't have touched that girl! Paul! Monica! What are you doing here? I came to see you. What's wrong? I had a nightmare. I got scared. I couldn't stand it anymore! Calm down. You must be shaken by the autopsy. The cord isn't moving. Take me away, Paul. Take me away from here. Did you see that? It was the wind. No, no, it wasn't the wind. It's the hatred, the bell is being moved by the hatred. It always sounds this way when someone has to die. It's been this way since she died without a drop of blood in her. Who? It was a seven-year-old girl. She would hang on to those cords of the bell, looking for help! Her name was Melissa. Melissa. Listen, the lady will stay here this night. Let them prepare a room for her. And, has Inspector Kruger come back yet? No, I haven't seen him. Martha! Yes? Martha, go upstairs. We need to get a room ready for the lady. Right away. Paul! Did you hear what the innkeeper said? It wasn't the wind making the bell sound! Monica! Don't let it affect you this way! But this is not like in the other cases. Even the church is condemned. It's a wreck. People seem to have no faith anymore. No, they are just people in poor spirits, victims of superstition. Miss, you can come upstairs now. Good night, Monica. Good night, Paul. And thank you. Nadienne! Nadienne, what's wrong? You are boiling, such high fever! What are you feeling? What are you doing here? What do you want? Leave! This is none of your business! Isn't she suffering enough already? You can't touch her! Let it be! A cilice! What have you done? Are you crazy? Do you want her to die? Madmen! Your methods are absurd. She could die of these wounds. My daughter will die anyway. Nothing can save her. Shut up! Quiet! Don't worry, Nadienne. It will all be over, you'll see. It's nothing bad. They... they picked me. They picked me! They picked me! I know I won't be saved. I know. She is very agitated. Her pulse is irregular. What should we do? She needs to rest. I will give her a sedative. I left my luggage in the inspector's room. Let's go, Martha. Give this to her when she wakes up, not more than 20 drops! - Don't hesitate if you need me. - Thank you, doctor. Furthermore I feel it necessary not to say anything about... what the burgomeister Karl told me, Inspector Kruger, after several meetings. The burgomeister says that the village suffers from a nightmare of a curse... that started with the death of little Melissa Graps. Since then, according to the belief of these people... Melissa keeps returning by appearing to the living. To make matters even more incredible... the people Melissa appears to, each die under mysterious circumstances... which the farmers call supernatural. Let's hurry! There's no time to waste. Hurry, hurry! Paul. There are lights at the cemetery. What might that be? Yes, I saw them, too. It could be Inspector Kruger. Maybe he has discovered something. No, don't go there! I'm not sure if it's Inspector Kruger down there. What would he be doing down there at night? I don't know. But I want to see what's going on. Kruger...! No, no! The burgomeister lives here. Keirr! Mr. Keirr! Yes, I am here. Come on in. Come in, doctor. I knew you would come. I found the body of Inspector Kruger at the cemetery. I know. I arranged for it to be taken there. He died by a gunshot to his temple. Don't use this tone with me. I didn't say that I killed him. Another victim of the demonic forces, right? And maybe even he had a coin in his heart! Yes. To keep his spirit from answering to the call... of Melissa. I understand this may seem impossible to a man of science like you. I read what you reported to Inspector Kruger. You can't expect me to believe those legends! I didn't believe them, either. They aren't legends... but a horrible reality instead. In the last few years more than ten people were thrown to their deaths. All of them were sane, without worries. None of them had enemies. We are all in danger here. Listen to me, Eswai. Leave as soon as possible. You, too, Miss, leave! You should have never come to this village! I was born here and the bodies of my parents are resting here. The tombs you placed your flowers on... are not the graves of your parents. The Schuftans never had any children. No... That's impossible. That's not true. This is another absurd invention. I have proof as to what I have said. The Schuftans left me a sealed envelope... to give to you in case you should return. I kept it in my utmost care. The Schuftans were servants at the Villa Graps. Your fate, like ours, is connected to this Villa. I will bring you that envelope now. Remember, doctor... the answer you are looking for can be found at the Villa Graps. Do you think there is some truth to it? Keirr! Keirr! Keirr! No... No... Open up! Open! Monica! Monica! I can't take this anymore! I can't take this! Stop it for God's sake! They will kill all of us here! Stop it! Help. Let's go get someone. Come. Come out! The burgomeister is dead! Cowards! You are such cowards, you'll get yourselves all killed! Nobody will ever help us. They are afraid! Let's go. Go away, you murderer! You killed my daughter Nadienne, enough now! Leave, leave! Damn you! It's your fault that my daughter is dead! Go away! Leave or I kill you! Let's go. Monica! Monica! Where are you? Monica! Monica! Monica! Monica, what's the matter? How strange, Paul. I came here as if I already knew this passage. It feels like I have already been here. Paul, I've never been here... yet I feel like I have already seen this place before. We are locked inside, the lock has snapped shut. There is nothing I can do. It's impossible to open it. Let's find another exit. This must be the Graps family crypt. Melissa Graps. Maybe we can get out from there. No, it's not possible. It's locked down there. Paul! It's Melissa. Melissa... Melissa. My little girl. My daughter. Why did you come here? You shouldn't break the peace of my little one. Why? Baroness, terrible things are happening in the village! The village gets what it deserves! They always hated us, the Graps family! They let my little girl die twenty years ago. The village was celebrating, everybody was drunk. One of them ran her over with a horse. She begged for help for a long time, desperately... but nobody would help her. In my opinion, they should all be condemned! And she bled to death. Bastards! Come, come! Please, come. Come. I left her room as it was. Here... she would play here. She was full of life. Happy, always without worries. She liked to see herself in the mirror. She wasn't able to reach up there. She had to stand on her toes here. This was her favorite doll. Everything has stayed the same as she had left it. With her dolls... she had so many of them... Melissa! Melissa! Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul! No! You have recovered, Dr. Eswai. You are lucky. I found you in the park just in the nick of time. You, too, were plunging towards death. The silver coin. At this point I can't do anything else for my dear Keirr... The silver in your heart will bring you eternal peace. I did everything I could to keep him from dying. I have dreaded this moment day by day. I loved you so much! My life without you has no more purpose. I will vindicate you, Keirr. I will go to Villa Graps, even if it will cost me my life. And Monica... Where is Monica? There is no more hope for Monica. She is Melissa's sister, the second daughter of the Baroness Graps. Yes, Monica, you are my little girl. I knew that you would come back to me. Wait. The Schuftans were my servants. I was the one who kept you in college. If you really are my mother, why would you do such a thing? Well, in order to keep you away from the Villa. I was worried for your life. This is you, Monica. You were two years old. And there is Melissa, your sister. After Melissa's deadly accident... they all died in this Villa by Melissa's hatred. Melissa cannot hate anymore now, she is all ashes by now. No! No. You saw her. She is still here. She uses me to return among the living. I am a medium with supernatural powers... which I cannot control. See, with these irresistible powers, I am their victim. They draw their strength from me, in order to survive. I know... I know that they are evil. But I can't stop them, I am their slave, they constantly force me... to call upon them! No! No! No! All of this is absurd, unreal! I have to find Paul. Please, help me. Take care of yourself! Leave! Here, they are coming. I feel them. Let them go! No. I can't let go of them. Go away! I said leave!! You should go as well. Melissa has been waiting for you for twenty years. Leave! Leave! Melissa! Melissa... Melissa... Enough! Baroness Graps, you are done killing. I have finally decided to put an end to this curse. Ruth... you are playing with your fate. Because it says you will die in this house. This doesn't matter to me anymore. I will put an end to this curse. No, you have no powers over them. You will die, too. I have to vindicate Keirr. You shouldn't have killed him. Your time has come! You will pay for what you did to him and all the other innocent victims! You are the cause of all that's happened. You who calls upon past spirits to use for your hatred... that has driven you since your daughter died! No! It's them, it's not my fault. It's them who force me to do so. It's not my fault. It is them who force me to do those things. No! You call upon Melissa with your skills as a medium... in order to invade and throw to their death the people of this village. They could not use their free will... and those poor people were unable to resist. But now your maleficent powers are coming to an end! "To an end..."? You are a murderer! You even want to kill your own daughter Monica. Yes, I hate her as well. The Schuftans kidnapped her from me and escaped through a tunnel. They didn't want Melissa to get to them. I hate them all. You will die. You will all obey me, all of you! Monica! Monica! Monica! Monica! Open for God's sake! Die you damned bitch! You and all your demonic creatures! Monica! This nightmare has now come to an end! The chain of death has finally been broken.
