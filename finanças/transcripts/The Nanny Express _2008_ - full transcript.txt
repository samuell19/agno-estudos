IT'S BECAUSE YOUR SON IS INCREDIBLY SMART. INCREDIBLY SMART, HUH? WHY, THE ULTRA-LAME HAPPY PARTY? WELL, THANKS TO KATE HERE, YOUR BROTHER NOW LOVES MATH. AND SINCE YOU USED TO NOT LOVE MATH, I'D HARDLY CALL THAT ULTRA-LAME. OH, THAT'S WHAT ALL THE EXCITEMENT IS ABOUT? MATH? SERIOUSLY? DAD, HOW ABOUT WE SAY I KINDA LIKE MATH? I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD EVER LOVE IT. DEAL. HEY, HOW ABOUT WE GO OUTSIDE AND THROW THE BALL AROUND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE DINNER? REALLY? CAN WE? ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER USED TO SAY TO ME? DO YOU WANT ME TO, LIKE, GUESS? OR IS THIS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS YOU REALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ANSWER? SHE USED TO SAY, DO YOU THINK IF YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THAT REFRIGERATOR WITH THE DOOR OPEN FOR LONG ENOUGH THAT NEW MAGICAL FOOD CHOICES ARE GONNA APPEAR? SO LET ME GUESS. THE END OF THE STORY IS YOU CLOSE THE DOOR. UH, NO, ACTUALLY, I USED TO SAY, "YES. I DO THINK THAT, MOM." AND I'D LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN. HAVE TO TRY THAT ON MY DAD NEXT TIME. WANT ME TO MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE FOR DANCE CLASS? IT'S OKAY. I'LL GRAB SOMETHING THERE. BUT, UH, THANKS ANYWAY. OKAY. HEY, HOW LONG DID YOU USE THAT LINE ON YOUR MOM? UNTIL I WAS 16. WELL, THAT WAS PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO STOP. 'CAUSE IF YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE FRIDGE AS MUCH AS I DO, YOUR MOM WAS PROBABLY GETTING TIRED OF HEARING YOU SAY THAT, OVER AND OVER. ACTUALLY, I, UM, I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HEARD ME SAY IT OVER AND OVER. FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS. WELL, THAT MUST BE REALLY NICE. FOR YOU TO HAVE THAT OPTION. COMING UP WITH STUPID COMEBACKS TO SAY TO YOUR MOM. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS THE STUFF THAT YOU REMEMBER REALLY WELL. MISS HEWITT? YEAH. WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE, YOU KNOW, FOR HELP, THINGS WEREN'T SO GREAT. NOT AT HOME, OR AT SCHOOL, OR ANYWHERE, REALLY. IT WAS PRETTY BAD ALL AROUND. I REMEMBER. I REALLY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO KEEP COMING HERE, YOU KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW, FOR SOME REASON, I DID. AND I GUESS IT WAS 'CAUSE OF YOU. OH. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, ALL THE HELP YOU'VE BEEN GIVING ME, AND TELLING ME HOW SMART I AM AND STUFF, AND ALL THE THINGS YOU SAID I CAN DO WITH MY LIFE? NOW, I REALLY THINK I CAN DO ANYTHING. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS FOR THAT. WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, SO THIS IS THE PART THAT YOU'RE REMEMBERING REALLY WELL, AND THIS IS THE PART THAT YOU NEED TO GO OVER AND OVER A FEW TIMES. AM I DISTURBING YOU? WELL, I COULD ASK THE SAME THING OF YOU. KATE, YOU'RE NOT DISTURBING ME. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE. YOU ALL DONE FOR THE NIGHT? OH, YEAH, I'M DONE WITH WORK AND TUTORING, AND I JUST HAVE A FEW HOURS OF STUDYING LEFT. I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME HERE AND GET A FEW MOMENTS OF NOTHINGNESS BEFORE I GET HOME. WELL, SOMETIMES, A BIT OF NOTHINGNESS CAN CURE A BAD DAY. YEAH. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. I'M WATCHING THESE TWO KIDS. THERE'S THIS LITTLE BOY. HE'S 9. HE'S AMAZING. YEAH. AND THEN HIS SISTER IS... UNBELIEVABLE. SHE'S SO ANGRY AND HAS SUCH AN ENORMOUS CHIP ON HER SHOULDER. AND I DON'T THINK I'M DOING A VERY GOOD JOB WITH HER. HER MOM DIED A FEW YEARS AGO, AND SHE WAS ONLY 13, SO. NOW, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, BUT I-I REMEMBER A VERY ANGRY, VERY SAD YOUNG GIRL WHO, UH, WHOSE FATHER USED TO DRAG HER TO THIS CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY. AND WHEN SHE STARTED OUT, OH, SHE WAS IN A HORRIBLE PLACE. SOME DAYS, SHE WAS DOWNRIGHT INCORRIGIBLE. BUT BIT BY BIT, SHE--SHE FOUND HER WAY. SHE STARTED RELATING TO OTHER PEOPLE, AND LEARNED HOW TO RESPECT THEM. SHE EVEN DID A LOT BETTER IN SCHOOL. AND, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, I WONDER WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT YOUNG GIRL. YEAH, I WONDER IF SHE TURNED OUT OKAY? NO, YOU--YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST IN GOD, KATE. TRUST THAT YOU'LL BE LED AND GUIDED TO FIND THE RIGHT AND PERFECT WAY TO REACH THIS LOVELY YOUNG GIRL. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, PEOPLE JUST NEED TO BE SHOWN HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR FAITH. IT WORKED FOR YOU. ALL THOSE YEARS OF... AH, YOU'LL DO JUST FINE. AND GIVE MY LOVE TO YOUR DAD. I WILL. ANYBODY HOME? UH, JUST ME. JUST YOU, HUH? YEAH. SO WHERE ARE THE KIDS? UH, BEN IS AT HIS SLEEPOVER, AND EMILY IS AT DANCE PRACTICE FOR HER RECITAL. YEAH. RECITAL. SO I GUESS, UH, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. UH, KATE, ACTUALLY, UM... I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU HOW THE EXAM WENT. OH. THE EXAM WENT INCREDIBLE. YEAH? AND... BEN GOT AN A. THAT'S FANTASTIC. I KNOW. HE WAS SO HAPPY. YEAH, I ACTUALLY MEANT YOUR EXAM. OH. HOW'D YOUR EXAM GO? UH, IT WENT GREAT. I GOT AN A AS WELL. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
