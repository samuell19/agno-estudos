(synth trill) - [Narrator] Although fictionalized, the following dramatization is inspired by actual events. (people chattering) (portentous music) (dog barks) (police siren wails) (baby crying) - [Neighbor] Let's go. (car horn peeps) - Pick it at 8:00 AM. And I'm gonna give you... Hey man...! Hey, that's just my kid. She don't know nothing. Hey... Hey, come back. Oh, man! Come on, don't do thi... Don't do this to me. What am I gonna do now? What am I gonna do now? Look at you. Don't you run away from me. You know what you've done. Get back here, girl. You're always ruining things. - Ray, please. Ray, please, don't. Stop this hitting! - Get off of me. You want some of this, huh? - [Mary] Don't! - Don't give me force. You got to face. Is this what you want? Hey, girl. Hey, you know I'm not done with you yet. Where the hell are you going? - Ray, please don't. You're going to kill her. Don't you go. - Please don't. - [Ray] Mary. - [Mary] Oh no, Ray, please! (Ray and Mary chattering) - [Ray] You know I'm right. - [Mary] Ray, please, don't do this. Please don't do this, Ray. (Mary screams) (Ray yells) - Come on, get back in here. Come on. Come on, I said get back here. Oh my God! - Did you see that? - Yeah! (dog barks) - [Bystanders] Call an ambulance! Is she okay? I don't know. Call an ambulance. Is that a kid, what happened? I don't know. (bystanders chattering) (ambulance siren wails) (ambulance radio chatters) (hospital staff chatters) - [Nurse] You're gonna be all right, don't worry. - Miss! - [Nurse] You'll be all right, just relax. - [Doctor] Check the vitals, get her cleaned up. I'm heading down to OR. I'll be back in about five minutes. - [Nurse] Fine. (ambulance radio chatters) We're almost there. - [Operator] To Pathology. Dr. Pullen to Pathology. (hospital staff chatters) - Hi. You're awake, that's good. I'm Ned Burkett, County Social Services. How you doin'? Don't be afraid. I'm one of the good guys. (tray clatters) (tray clatters) Can you hear me? No, I don't think you can. (office staff chatters) (phone rings) - I have 48 open files, two hearings this week, and I'm finishing up the grant. I'll get it to you tomorrow. - Are we up to speed on the hotline? - Almost, but I'm having trouble with Friday. - We'll staff the hotline first and then finish the grant. We have time. - Sorry, I'm late. - You had all those in your desk at home? - My refrigerator. - They think you're kidding. Status report. - I have 56 open files. I have three hearings this week. Oh, and I have three families that need clothes and housing, so if anybody has any leads, please let me know. And my carburetor is acting up again. - And you're way behind in your paperwork. - I can either service my clients, or spend all my time writing reports. - Now, there's a compromise in there somewhere. - Pam, a deaf woman at the hospital needs your help. - Okay. - [Barbara] Now, listen, I'm gonna need those reports. - [Operator] Dr. Pullen to radiology. - Ned! Hi. - Hi, Pam. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. - You're the one who called? I thought you gave all this up. - I tried but teaching wasn't for me. I missed the trenches. - [Pam] Well, I'm glad you're back, we need you. - Thanks. Ah, Laura Keyes. 20, deaf, possibly mute. She was brought in last night by ambulance, unconscious, no identification. I'd probably still be trying to ID her, if her father hadn't come in and demanded a release. - How badly is she beat? - Pretty bad. I didn't want to release her until I investigated, and I'm glad I didn't. Especially after her father, I'm pretty sure he's the one who did it. Now, here's the twist. According to neighbors, she was never let outside the apartment. - What do you mean never let out? - They kept her locked up, even when they went out. He told one neighbor that she was retarded. The only thing that was good for was keeping the place clean. - How did she end up here? - She jumped out of a window to get away from him, down two stories. She's lucky she's only bruised. People next door said the beatings were a regular thing. - And they never called the police? - They thought since she never screamed for help that she was all right. - Well, maybe she couldn't scream. Did they ever think of that? - Here she is. Uh, talk to her then. Make a call, will you? - Thanks. - Bye, Laura. - [Operator] Dr. Roddall, please dial 884. - Hi. My name is Pam Willis. I'm from the Commission for Battered Women. I'm here to help you. Who did this to you? (hospital staff chatters) (Pam sighs) If at first you don't succeed... Who hurt you? Do you understand? You're illiterate. - Late last night. - [Rita] Oh, yes, she's here. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Please take a seat. I'll have the doctor talk to you as soon as- - Just tell me where she is. - That's the man who hurt you? Father? It's okay. I'm going to talk to him. He will go away. Stay here. - I, I don't care what you say. She's my daughter and I want her now. - Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Keyes- - Mr. Keyes? I'm Pam Willis. If you want information about your daughter, you're gonna have to talk to me. She's my client. - [Ray] Client? What are you talking about? - Your daughter has been badly beaten. I'm here to make sure that she receives adequate care, and to help her take steps so it won't happen again. - I don't have to talk to you. She's mine. - She's not yours, Mr. Keyes. She's of legal age, and she told me she doesn't want to see you. - You're a liar. She didn't tell you anything. She can't talk. - I understood her perfectly. - She's here and I'm gonna find her. - If you don't leave immediately, I will call security and have you arrested. - This is none of your business? - You assaulted her, that made it my business. - She's a lying whore. If you think she's black and blue now, you just wait. - This case is under investigation. If you persist in trying to see my client without her consent, you'll find yourself in jail. Do you understand? (Pam sighs) - A real charmer? - Yeah. Is her room ready? - If it isn't, I'll get it ready myself. - Thanks, Rita. (sighs) I'll try later. (phone rings) - How's it going? - [Pam] Don't ask. - Purview had two beds an hour ago. - They don't take deaf clients, and the few that do are full. How long have we been doing this? - More years than I care to remember. - Why does it seem to be getting worse instead of better? - Well, we're making a difference. I mean, last year alone, we did a 4% increase- - Barbara, you're getting to be as bad as my ex with those damn baseball statistics. - I'm sorry, it's pure reflex. Before I hit people up for a donation, I give them the stats. - Don't talk to me, I don't have any money. - I know. I sign your checks. (woman announces over intercom) (elevator bell dings) (people chatter) - Hi. - I didn't expect to see you today. - The hospital called me. The father showed up and tried to drag her out. Luckily, the security guy stopped him. - Is she okay? - She's scared, but she's okay. Listen, I'm arranging for a restraining order. As soon as you think she's ready, we'll file charges. - That could be a while. She's illiterate. - She doesn't sign? - She doesn't even know what signing is, or words, the alphabet. That animal kept her locked up and didn't teach her anything. - He said she's retarded. - I don't think so. I want to get her tested, but I have to figure out how to pay for it first. - Here. I want you to call this number. Ask for Frank. Tell him I referred you. Set up whatever tests you need. I'll find some account to bury it in. - I was right. - About what? - We did need you back. Thanks. (door latch clicks) (forlorn piano music) I heard about your father. I'm sorry. Okay. Round one. (gentle music) I'm Pam. You're Laura. I knew you were going to look at me like that. Okay. A. A. Apple. Apple. This is going swimmingly. B. B. Bird. Bird. B. Very good. A. Perfect. You really don't have a clue, do you? - [Rita] Pam. Hi, Rita. - Hi. What time are you gonna be ready tomorrow? - Ready for what? - To take her home. - That's impossible, I haven't found a shelter for her yet. - I'm sorry. The doctor said she's ready, and we'll need the bed. I need you here by 10. - 10. No problem. (phone rings) Hi, this is Pam Willis. I can't take your call right now, but please leave a message after the tone. Thanks. (phone beeps) - [Lisa] Hi, this is Lisa from West Side Shelter. I'm returning your call. - Hello, hang on. Hi. Thanks for calling me back. - No problem. Look, I'm really sorry but we can't take her. - But you have space! - But we're not equipped to handle people like her. - She's deaf, not a homicidal maniac. - That's our policy, I'm sorry. - I have had it. If you don't take her, I'm calling the county. I won't win, but you'll be drowning in paperwork for a month. - Let me think about it. - You do that. (Muttso whimpers) Muttso, what do you want for dinner? Mustard? Rice? (Muttso whimpers) Ah, right, we had that last night. Okay. Peanut butter and jelly. (Pam sighs) And crackers. (Muttso barks) Here you go. (van whooshes by) (children chattering) (doubtful music) - Change your mind. - This is your room. You stay here. I'll be back tomorrow. I wasn't going to hit you. I was going to touch your hair. You have pretty hair. I'll see you tomorrow. She can stay 30 days, right? Look, I'm sorry I threatened you, but I was out of options. - Forget it. I've been up against the wall myself, but I'm serious about the terms. Everyone's got to pull their own weight around here. That means you're gonna have to be here part of every day to make sure Laura understands what's expected of her, and to make sure she does it. - I'll be here. Thank you. (forlorn music) You can't catch me! - That's mine! (kids yelling) (radio plays music in the distance) (car horn blasts) - I'm Pam Willis, I'm here for Laura's clothes. - I know who you are. Why don't you just send her home where she belongs? - It's her choice, she doesn't want to come. I think you know why. - Wait here. - Wait. Was Laura born deaf? - No, she got an infection when she was six. - But she doesn't sign, or read. - Ray wanted her home. I did the best I could. - So, she never went to school? - She's stupid. That's why he loses his temper. He doesn't want to beat her. - She is not stupid, and there is no excuse for what he did. (people chattering) - Why do we have to wait a week? - Because your husband's lawyer asked for more time to prepare. (Amy sighs) (phone rings) - He's gonna come after me. I know it. - Is there somewhere you can go where he won't find you just until the hearing? - I've got three kids. They have school. - We have a restraining order, but if you think he's gonna try something, you have to go somewhere safe. (phone rings) - I'm tired of hiding, that's no way to live. - Neither is having 911 on speed dial. I know I can get you into a shelter. All you have to do is collect the kids and show up. - Thanks, Pam, but we're all right. - If there is any trouble, or you change your mind, you call me. - Hey, we're running long in there, and I've got a meeting at 2:00. How's your afternoon look? - I have got to go help with Laura. I was supposed to be there this morning. - You can't go there every day. - I have no choice. There's no one else to help. (gentle music) - [Child] Hold on, hold on! Hi. - How you doing? - I brought you something. Your clothes. What's wrong? (Pam gasps) (uneasy music) - You work too hard. - You're right. I'm taking a week off. - Ooh, as long as you're dreaming, take two. You're short. What's this? - Laura's test scores. She's very bright, but she has the conceptual level of a five-year-old and the emotional skills of a child of eight. These levels will increase with education and attention, but it makes it almost impossible to place her, because she requires constant supervision. - This is tough. I mean, it's almost outside our domain. - [Amy] Pam! - She's not just a battering case. Some other agency should be involved. - Amy. Amy! Amy! Amy! (tense music) (gun bangs) (Amy screams) - Get on the ground, buddy! - Someone call an ambulance! - [Cop 1] I got him! - [Cop 2] Call for backup! - [Cop 1] Right. - Uh, look, I don't think we should wait any longer. Let's get this meeting started. (somber music) - She just got out of surgery. She's going to make it. - Great. Listen. I don't want anyone in this room to think what happened was somehow our fault. - I should have made her go to that shelter. - Pam, she was shot in a public building. It didn't matter where she was staying. Are we all clear on that? (phone rings) All right, let's get on with the meeting. Paula, you were talking about some volunteers you have for the hotline. - L. (child chatters) Good. (bird shrills) Leaf. (birds twitter) Good. (car alarm blares) (Pam screams) (dogs bark) My ears are bad. Loud sounds hurt. I'll explain it to you someday. Thanks a lot. - Bad day? - I can't find a place for Laura, and I have to pick her up in an hour. - What are you gonna do? - I don't have a choice, I'm gonna take her home. - Is her father still there? - I'm not taking her to her house, I'm taking her to mine. - No way. - What other options do I have? I mean, tell me an agency that can help. Functionally, she's a child, but she's not a minor so CPS is out. She's deaf, but she's illiterate so no DSS program. She's not an abused spouse. She's not an abused minor- - Pam, I get it, but she's a client. You can't get personally involved. It's inappropriate, there are boundaries. - Well, maybe I should just save us all the trouble, and take her back to her father and let him finish the job. - Taking her home is crossing the line. I won't allow it. - Well, if you have to fire me, fire me, but I am not letting her slip through the cracks. (office staff chatters) You'll come to Pam's house. You come to Pam's house. To Pam's house. You're okay. Don't worry. You're okay. (doubtful music) (residents chatter) Stay here. I'm gonna go in there, and then I'm gonna come back. Stay here. (labored music) (active music) It's okay, you're okay. You're okay. Pam. House. Pam's house, yes! We're going to Pam's house. Book. Book. Light. Door. Door. Window. Chair. Chair. Table. - What is she trying to say? - Everything! (birds warbling) (child chatters in the distance) (dog barks in the distance) (Ralph squawks) (Laura gasps) Yes, bird. Aren't you the smart one? Come on, Ralph, come on. That's a good bird. Oh, yes. There you go. (Laura gasps) Ralph. Right, bird. One concept at a time, Willis. I don't think Ralph will mind. - No more food. - Isn't that full? You know that one, right? - You're full. - My father always says I'm full and it's coming out my ears. (laughs) - If you rub your tummy, that means that you're hungry. Most of you probably close your hands to tell people... (car engine hums) (birds chirping) - What are you doing? No, no, no, no. You do not have to clean my house. (bell chimes) You read. Learn. Pam cleans. Later, right. Knock yourself out, kid. My family. Far away. (soft piano music) My daughter. Her name? Sarah. She's, um... I have to go to work. You stay here and watch the tape. Okay? What am I talking about? I can't leave you here alone. (Pam sighs) (phone rings) (office staff chatters) (phone rings) (car horn peeps) - [Paula] Hey Pam. - Hi. Thanks. This is Laura. This is Paula. Um, is Barbara here? - Oh, there she is now. - Morning. - Good morning. - I couldn't leave her alone, not on the first day. This is Laura. Laura, this is Barbara. She's a fast learner. - I'm going to be monitoring this situation very closely. - She's happy to see you. (phone rings) - [Receptionist] Social services. (people chatter) - Barbara. Consider a bribe? I admit I bend the rules. - There's the understatement of the year. - But that doesn't mean I don't respect them, or you. (Barbara sighs) - Just find her a place and I'll look the other way. But just this once. (phone rings) (shoppers chattering) - Your hair looks pretty. (upbeat music) What do you think? Laura can't think. (Pam laughs) Oh, that's nice and expensive. We go upstairs. Okay, here we are. We go up. It's okay. It's okay. Sorry. Watch her, watch her. Watch her. (Laura gasps) (shoppers chattering) You like this? No, no, no. No, no. You take this to Pam's house... Or not. Works for me. One more. (doubtful music) (shoppers chattering) (alarm blares) - Stop! - [Announcer] Please go to the nearest register, and have a salesperson remove the anti-shoplifting tags from your items. The system has been activated... - Hey! Officer! Wait! Sir! - Stop! Miss! I have to take the merchandise. - Sir! No, wait! Wait, please! Excuse me. - Hold up! That's her. That's good, go for it! - Please, let go of her! She doesn't understand. She's deaf. (Laura screams) - No, she's shoplifting these clothes. - No, please, look! She's not a shoplifter. She thought I was gone, so she came out to find me. She's my client. Look, we're going right back in the store and pay for everything. (calm music) (bystanders chatter) (car engine roars in the distance) (vase crashes) (dog barks in the distance) (birds twittering) (doubtful music) Hitting is bad. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. (candle holder crashes) It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. (gentle music) (Laura sobs) - [Employee] Pick up. - Thanks a lot. Thank you. Have a good day. (people chatter) I might have a lead in a place for Laura. They're expecting your call. Keep your fingers crossed. - (chuckles) It's more than you can do. What happened? - I caught a football wrong. My oldest kid's got a rifle arm. - How's it going? - My hats off to Julie. I never realized how much she did. Even the amount of dirty dishes they generate is staggering. - What's it been, two years? - Yeah. It still feels like it happened yesterday. How long was it before you were able to function again after Sarah? - Long time. And I still have moments, especially when I hear about some drug dealer getting early parole, then I become temporarily deranged. How are the boys doing? - I think all right. At least they had time to prepare. If there's anything merciful about cancer, it does give you that. (doubtful music) Are you all right? - Yeah. I think the hardest part for me is not being someone's mom. You know? When I'm out and I hear some kid yell, "Hey mom!" I know it's not for me. I miss buying her clothes and fighting over what time she needs to come home. On the other hand, it's much less laundry. (birds chirping) (Muttso growls softly) You know school? Good. Laura's going to school. (Ralph squawks) Yes. Laura goes to school and lives there. The people at this school are deaf like you. It's good for Laura to be with deaf people. Laura goes to school. Laura has to learn. No. School, that's it. You come here weekends. If you're trying to make me feel like Attila the Hun, you're doing a hell of a job. (door slams shut) (Pam sighs) (bell tolling) - Time for class. Today is Tuesday. Pam comes here Friday. Go to class. - There's a dog show on Saturday. All breeds. (Muttso whimpers) Yeah, you're right. They are kind of stuck up. Hey, we didn't finish the paper. (cars whoosh by) - What time is it? Time. Good. Good. What day is today? What day is today? What day is today? Very good. Very good. What day is tomorrow? What day is tomorrow? Good. Very good. (car horn blasts) (phone rings) - Hello? Pam Willis. - Pam. It's Amy. - Amy, I've been trying to reach you. How are you? - Oh, I'm tired. We just moved. That's why I called to give you the new number. It's 555... - Um, okay. - [Amy] 0100. - And what's the address? - Oh, um, it's 1201 Chelsea, same zip. - (sighs) I heard that Joe is out on bail. He hasn't tried to contact you? - No. - Oh, just be careful. Do you need anything? - No, no. We're fine. - Well, if you change your mind, or if you need help, give me a call. - I will. - [Pam] Okay. - Thanks. - Bye-bye. (car horn honks in the distance) - Hey! (train whistle blasts) - If you have something to discuss, call for an appointment. - I want my daughter. - Why? So, you can stand by and watch your husband use her for a punching bag. - She told the police things that aren't true. - Please. - Just who the hell do you think you are, getting her to file charges against me? - You assaulted her. - I was keeping her in line. - You kept her locked up like an animal for 14 years, and you beat her. - You weren't there. You don't know what I had to put with. - I have seen your kind a thousand times. You are pathetic. - I want those charges dropped! - You come near me again, and I'll file charges against you myself! (Pam sighs) - We're not going to try the case. - What are you talking about? You saw the pictures, the hospital report. - We don't anticipate a good outcome to a trial. - But you have irrefutable evidence! - Well, we know he beat her, even he doesn't deny that, but he's going to say he was only trying to protect her, and things got out of hand. - Give me a break. Protect her from what? - He says she would sneak out of the house at night, and she was doing drugs. - She never once set foot outside that apartment. We have neighbors who will testify to that. - And what kind of protection is that, beating her half to death? - You're not telling me anything I don't agree with. - Well, then try the case. - I'll be blunt. The problem is is her. She's not going to be effective on the stand. - I'll interpret for her. - She's not literate in sign, and this pantomime that you two use isn't exactly scientific. They'll argue that it's your interpretation of the case. - It's the best we can do. She needs the court's protection. He's violent, and she doesn't have anyone to take her part. He has kept her as an illiterate slave away from anyone who could help her, and now you're going to reward him and punish her because you don't expect a good outcome? - Is he guilty? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes. If he's found guilty, will he serve time? Probably not. I'm sorry. - You should be. Don't tell me you're on her side. - Wait a minute, we're on the same team, but I'm entitled to my own opinion. - You think she's right? - I'm not saying that. Well, she has tried a few more cases then we have. But that doesn't matter, all I care about is Laura's welfare. - Well, what do you think I'm fighting for? Chopped liver? It's important that this battery go on record. His fear of another arrest will protect her a lot more than hiding her away for the rest of her life. - I agree, so as soon as she's able to sign enough, let's bring her back. - Well, that could take a long time. - So, it takes a long time, so what? - (sighs) It really aggravates me when you're so reasonable. - That's why make an effective team. You're passion and my temperance. I'm running late. I'll check in with you next week. (Ned chuckles) (people chatter) (Pam sighs) - We will go to court later, not now. Laura goes to school first. Learns to sign so everyone can understand. Let's go home and enjoy the weekend. (dreary music) What's making you sad? No, Laura is smart. She learns very fast. (Ralph squawks) Hearing and speaking do not make you smart. Wanting to learn makes you smart. Pam has a dream for Laura to go to school, study hard, get a good job, her own house, car. Yes, Laura drives a car, her car. Yes, that would make me very happy. (bird twitters) (lively music) Whoo! Move. That's it. Yeah! Whoo! All right. (gentle music) Yes, I miss her. Sarah, don't worry. Laura's here now. Laura take care of Pam. That's so sweet. (fire alarm blares) (Pam gasps) (Pam yells) Turn it off! (screams) My ears! My ears! Turn it off! (Pam groans) (Pam yelling) This is Pam Willis at 2311 Shady Avenue. I share my home with a deaf woman. So if you hear this recording, there is an emergency. Please come immediately. This is Pam Willis... - [Nurse] Right, well, there's nobody in the lab right now. (woman announces over intercom) (people chattering) (elevator bell dings) - Excuse me, are you Davidson? - Yes. - Your mother's gonna be just fine. (ambulance siren blares) (elevator bell dings) - Um... Pam will be all right. (door handle clicks) (elevator bell dings) - I'm okay. Let's go. - Hmm? Oh. Hey. I got a feeling you look better than me. (Pam laughs) (crickets chirrup) How's the pain? - Well, I don't feel quite so much like throwing myself in front of a bus. - I don't know where to put that on a scale from 1 to 10, but it sounds like an improvement. - Thank you. Where's Laura? - Cleaning the kitchen. - I don't want her doing that. - She wants to. Let her. She needs to let off some steam. She handled herself pretty well. - She is smart, huh? - Get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow? - Ring softly. (dog barks in the distance) (birds warbling) Why are you sleeping here? What's wrong? You didn't hurt me. You did everything right. My ears are bad. (soft piano music) I was deaf like you for two years. Yes, deaf. I was married to a man who beat me. Once he beat me so badly, I became deaf. Many years ago. I had an operation. Um... A doctor... Uh... Fixed my ears, but I still have problems with loud noises. I did nothing to make him beat me, just like you did nothing to make your father beat you. It doesn't matter what you did, he should not hit you. I thought it was my fault that he would get so angry, but it wasn't. And it wasn't your fault either. No, Laura is not bad. (cars whoosh by) - Hello. As principal of the school I never dreamed I'd have to put money in a budget for a choir for an all deaf class. The next you know they're gonna want their own band. (crowd laughs) Here we have Sister Ann and our angels singing from their hearts.

You're welcome. - Just 'cause you won't look at me, doesn't mean I'm not here. You couldn't make those charges stick, could you? Guess there was no one to tell what happened. - There is someone to tell what happened, and as soon as she can, she will. - You never give up, do you? - No, I don't. - Well, you're gonna lose this one. When she finds out there's no place else to go, she'll be back. (bell tolls) (phone rings) - Ms. Willis. - Sister Ann. I was on my way to see you. I can't believe the progress you're making with Laura. She's learning so quickly. - I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school is closing. - What? - Diocese funds were cut, and they had to make adjustments accordingly. We were just informed this morning. I've been trying to find Laura a placement, but it's gonna be difficult. - When does this happen? - The end of the month. We're asking all of the students who board here convert to day status by the end of the week. - She can't stay here? - Not after Saturday, no. She's welcome to continue class for a month. - But it's a two-hour commute. There's no way I can bring her here every morning. - I wish there was an alternative, Pam. I'm sorry. - Okay. The Langston School, right. I'll give it a try. Thank you very much. (phone rings) Oh, thank you. (office staff chatters) - Textbook catalog. Some county bureaucrat jerks me around, I tell him off, and I head down here for chocolate. How's Laura doing? - Fine. She's, uh... You know, she's got basics down now. She just needs to learn how to spell like any other seven-year-old. - Man, I hope they teach her to spell better than me. That school was a godsend, what would we have done without it? - I don't know. - Well... Back to the mines. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. The school closes tomorrow. I still haven't found her a place. I'm not gonna send her back to Ray. - Lunch is on me. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. Worst comes to worst, we'll put her on assistance. - Oh great, then she can move to a welfare hotel. Maybe the junkies and hookers will get her some work. - Well, give me an alternative. The shelters are either full or they won't take her. - She's not going to one of those hotels, that's not gonna happen to her. - You know, maybe you should think about letting another advocate take over the case. Ned! - For your sake. - Well, none of them can sign. Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore. I can't eat when I'm angry. - All right, truce. We'll figure something out. (people chatter) - [Pam] I thought you broke your right finger. - This is new, basketball. - (gasps) I didn't know raising boys was so dangerous. - I'm surprised I can even walk. You know, you should come by and play with us sometime. We're at Sinclair Park every Saturday morning. - That's when I catch up on my paperwork. - You can't spend your whole life working, Pam. - My life is my work. My clients don't have a lot of options, and that means I don't either. - You aren't one of your clients, but maybe you should be. At least you get more of your attention that way. - I appreciate your interest, Ned, but I'm fine. It's not as grim as it sounds. - Just admit, you should start taking care of yourself more often. Promise me you'll think about it. - I promise. - Good. - You can be very exasperating. - Look who's calling the kettle? (birds chirping) - Hi. - Hi. - I'm sorry I didn't call, but I was coming this way, and I thought I'd dropped this off. I've had it on my desk for a month. It's a house warming present. - Oh, I love it. Thank you. I'm, I'm sorry I haven't checked in in a while. We've just been so busy. - You don't have to check in. I'm glad things are going well for you. (uneasy music) - You coming back in? - I'll be right there. - Oh, Amy. It's just gonna happen again, and this time he might kill you! - I'm sorry. (cars whoosh by) (car horn blasts) - I'm sorry you're not happy, but we have no choice. Your friends will come and visit you, I promise. That's enough! We have to leave! You know, I could be at home taking a bath, or reading, or lying on a beach somewhere drinking something pink. But, no, I have to give up any pretense of a life to take care of people who don't have a clue. I'm sorry you have to leave your friends, but you have to learn about priorities, like having a roof over your head. And Amy, well, you'll be glad to know she's alive and well. (tense music) I might as well just throw my life down a rafter. (Pam chatters quietly) What are you doing? (brakes screech) Wait! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not Laura's house, Pam's house. Not Laura's house, Pam's house. Pam's house. No, no, you're never going back there again. Never. Never. Never. (soft music) Okay. (office staff chatters) - Barbara? - Hey. On the facilities list, you forgot the Catholic Mission Home. - No, I didn't. - It's not here. - Well, that's, that's because it's closed. - It's open, Pam has a client there. - Had... It closed a month ago. - You sure? - Yeah. - Thanks. (washing machine hums) (door knocks) (door knocks) - Barbara? - Laura's here. - Yes. - She's been here all month. - Yes, but I- - No buts. You lied to me. - I didn't have any choice. - I don't know how to make this any more clear. You are required by law to act in the best interest of your client, and bringing her home isn't in it by a long shot. - What do you want me to do? - Keeping her here is not an option. - What do you want me to do? - If I could hand you a list of options- - What do you want me to! - I want you to do your job! Don't you think it kills everyone to have to send somebody back to the hell they came from? - I don't know what happened to you. When we started, we were gonna save the world if it killed us, and now here we are 15 years later, and you're ordering me to just throw someone away? Is that what authority does, makes you callous? - Are you through? - I didn't mean that, but I, I have to keep her safe. - Aren't you mistaking her for someone else? Look. You got a week. If she's not out of this house, you're fired. (Pam sighs) (people chattering) - [Ned] Pam. - Ned, hi. - Hi, I got Laura into the Pearson Learning Center. - I thought that was for people with physical disabilities. - Well, it is primarily. They do have some hearing-impaired residents, and the best part is she'll be in school every day. - You're amazing! I can't thank you enough. - You can try. - I got to go. You're a lifesaver. I'll call you later. (alarm beeps) - All right, heads up now. There you go. (man laughs) - [Players] Are you kidding me? That's got to be a traveling violation. Way to go, John. Over here, come on, pass it! Pass it! (players yell) Over here! Pass it to me, I got it! (players groan) (radio plays music) (residents chatter) (whistle shrills) - Hi, I'm Pam Willis. - John Sanchez. This must be Laura. - She's not too thrilled about being here. - She's gonna love it. If you want to just step back here, I'll get the forms for you to fill out. If you could just fill this out, we'll get the ball rolling. - Thanks. - Have a seat here, please. Here's a pen. - Thank you. - Luckily, we had a space. First one in two years. - [Pam] Really? - I'm sure it's gonna work out. But like I told you, the residents here are pretty much on their own. - Well, she's smart and she's come a long way in a very short time. She does need some supervision, so maybe your staff could keep an eye out? - We'll do the best we can. - Thank you. (birds warbling) See you Friday. (forlorn music) - Come on. Toss it. Come on. (gentle music) Come on. - Time. Hi. You play? You play? Come on. I need one more player. They're killing me. Please. I'm Doug. Laura. Hey, guys, hey! This is Laura. She's on my team. - Laura. Hi, Laura. I'm Mike. Mike. - [Players] Okay, we're up. Set five. All right. All right. Oh! - Good. - Give me five! - Okay, all in favor of a comedy club? (phone rings) All in favor of a picnic? - [Employees] Sounds good, picnic. - Picnic it is. I guess that's it. - Hey, Pam, how does Laura like the new school? - I don't know, I haven't been to see her yet. - [Paula] Well, tell her I said hi, okay? - I will. (phone rings) (people chatter) (radio plays music) (residents chatter) - Can you use your voice? Can you say Laura? Feel the vibration. That's my voice. Try yours. Are you afraid you'll sound weird? I became deaf when I was 15. So, I know what my voice sounds like. I like to talk, even though I can't hear it. I'm afraid if I don't, someday I won't be able to. - Hey. Hi. - You remember Mike? He came to visit last week. What's up? - Hi. Listen, my plans canceled tonight, so I thought maybe you guys might want to go out, play some pool? - Want to play pool? - [Mike] What's she saying? - She doesn't know what pool is. - Tell her we'll show her. It's fun. It's fun. - We'll show you. It's fun. She can't, she has homework. - When, when can she make it? When? - Tomorrow. - Great. Tomorrow we'll play pool. Tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay? - We'll go tomorrow. (Laura chuckles) (soft piano music) (Muttso whimpers) - Hello, Muttso the Magnificent. How are you? (Muttso whimpers) What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? (Pam sighs) (soft music continues) - Laura. Laura. (stereo plays country music) (car horn peeps) (Laura claps) - If I worked at a pool hall, I'd run the table too. - Fine. - Come on. Come on. (clients chattering) I'll show you. (Laura gasps) Great. Try again. (dog barks) (children chatter) (TV playing rock music) - Oh, weekend to the teenager, my favorite. (radio playing rock music) What are you doing? You left the TV on and dishes all over the place. Are you waiting for me to clean it up? When? You're supposed to be doing homework. If you have time for playing with makeup, my makeup, by the way, you have time for chores. I wa... I want you to go in there and clean up your mess! You better straighten up. I didn't like this behavior in Sarah, and I don't like it in you! (Pam sighs) (dog barks) (children yelling in the distance) What am I doing? (Ralph squawks) Dinner's ready. (soft music) I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, but I have to work and so do you. You have to work very hard to catch up. (Ralph squawks) Yes, you have to catch up to all people your age, hearing and deaf. Well, I'm sick of working all the time, too, but that's what people do. They work and they study. And if they're lucky, they have people they love to go home to. (portentous music) Ralph! Here, Ralph! Come, Ralph! Here, Ralph! (Ralph squawks) Ralphie! (Ralph swishes) (Ralph squawks) (birds warbling) (van engine hums) (people chattering) I'm sorry about the weekend, and I'm sorry about the bird. We'll get a new bird. I know you love that bird. I know you're not Sarah! Fine, you don't want me to come back, I won't! (doubtful music) (keyboard clicks) - May I come in? - You're the boss. - [Barbara] How's the stash? - Help yourself. (office staff chatters) (phone rings) - Look, Pam. I didn't want to see either of you get hurt. There's going to come a time when you're not gonna be able to help her anymore. And no matter how close you are, someday she's gonna leave. You've had enough loss in your life. I miss you. - I have a lot of work to do here. - Cool. (dog barks) (people chatter) (bell tolls) - Good catch. Gee, hope you're hungry. - I could be starving and not make a dent in that table. - Oh, my boys will help out in that department. Is Laura here? - No. - Is she all right? - She's fine. She's doing well in her classes. She seems to like it. - But... - She's angry at me. - Well, now, that's good. She's breaking away from mom. I'm going through that times three. - [Kathy] Ned, Ned! - I think somebody is trying to get your attention. Come on! - I'll be right there. The game is gonna start soon. I'm center field. Her name's Kathy. - I didn't know you were seeing anyone. - Just happened. I wasn't looking for it. I didn't think I was ready. It feels right. I hope you find someone, too, Pam. - Well, give me the name of the store, I'll pick someone up on the way home. (Ned chuckles) - You always make me laugh. Hey, you want to play? - No, no. I'll come by later and watch. - Well, don't watch too long, okay? (doubtful music) (children chatter) (birds twittering) (dog barks) (van whooshes by) (residents chatter) - Hi. Where is, um... Doug? Doug, where? Where is Doug? Doug, where? Study, studying. Studying. (Mike laughs) Um... You, me, play pool. You wanna play pool, hmm? You and me, I'll drive. Great, come on. (wistful country music) ♪ Darling, I'll have you remember ♪ - Hey, you're aiming too far left. ♪ Last night's not the way it used to be ♪ (Sarah chuckles) (Sarah laughs) - Um... You, me, one more. ♪ Been taken for granted ♪ ♪ All good things fade away ♪ ♪ But it's not too late to learn to start again ♪ - Sure thing, okay. (wistful music continues) - I'll see you later tonight. (people chatter) (truck stereo plays rock music) (frogs croaking) Oh, home. Oh, you want to go home? Listen, I'm gonna take you home, okay? But I need something first. (tense music) Okay? It's okay. It's okay. Stop it. (Laura squeals) Stop it, okay? Just give me a kiss. (Laura squeals) (Laura whimpers) (Laura screams) Bitch! (phone rings) - Hello? - [John] Is this Pam? - Yes. - This is John Sanchez at Pearson. Is Laura with you? - No. Isn't she there? - We did a bed check, she's missing. - I'll be right over. (van engine hums) (crickets chirrup) - When was the last time you talked to her? - I can't handle any I told you so's right now. - That's not what I meant. I just wonder whether her father might've found her. - I don't think so. She's angry at me. Maybe I pushed too hard, maybe we got too close. I just wanted to make it- Don't blame yourself. - Why not? You knew this would happen. I screwed up. - You broke every rule in the book, and you're a royal pain in the ass, but you're the only one who cared enough to make sure she got a chance. (Pam sighs) - John? John? Is she back? - No. - What did the police say? - They said call back in a couple of hours, if she's still not back. Great. - You have no idea where she went? - No. - What about her clothes? - They're still in her room. I have two staff people looking, that's all I had to send. We're handling it, Doug. - I saw her earlier today. - When? - Around dinnertime. She and Mike were heading to his car. - Who's Mike? - Just a guy. He hangs out here sometimes. - Laura knows him? - A little. He took us to play pool. It's where he works. - Would he hurt her? - I don't know. I don't know him that well. I should've stopped them. - Do you know where he lives? Where is this pool hall? - Fantasia Pool Hall, a few blocks down Central. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirrup) (door rattles) - We're closed. - We're from Pearson Learning Center. One of the residents is missing. - I'm sorry, whoever you're looking for isn't here. - I need the address of someone who works for you: Mike. - What do you want him for? - He was with Laura today, that's the girl who's missing. - Mike. - [Pam] Where's Laura? - Uh, Laura who? - You came to see her today. I don't know what you're talk- - Listen! (bottle crashes) Oh my God! If you hurt her... - I, I already said I never even saw her. - You wanna play like that, I'm gonna call the cops. Where is your phone? - W-Wait! - If you know anything, you better tell us now. - Where is she? - I didn't hurt her. I didn't hurt her. - Where is she! - She's in the park! - What park? - Creston. - Come on, Pam. Pam. Pam. - [Barbara] Okay, there. There, there. Turn here. (van engine hums) Look at that. - [Pam] I'm gonna stop, maybe they've seen her. - [Barbara] Okay. Hey. Pam, that's her. That's her! - Oh, God! What happened, what happened? What are you doing to her? No, I know her! I know her! I know her, I'm Pam. I'm Pam, I know her. What happened? - She got kind of roughed up. She's all right. - [Biker] She's okay. She's okay. - Are you okay? I was so scared. (soft music) Okay. Come on. Thank you so much. - [Biker] Yeah, sure, lady. - Thanks, guys. - [Biker] Forget it. - You okay? I was so worried. (frogs croaking) (crickets chirrup) (dog barks in the distance) - I was worried. I care about you. - No, I'm sorry. I had my dream for you, and I never stopped to ask about yours. (soft music) Of course, you can have a dream, and it doesn't have to be the same as mine. It can be whatever you want. College? A job. Making your own life is a good dream. My dream? (Pam sighs) I have to think about that. (people chattering) - [Clerk] I think it should be at 8:30 tomorrow. - Don't be afraid. Just tell the truth. (elevator bell dings) (woman announces over intercom) Should we go in? (gentle music) - Thank you, Pam. - You've been keeping secrets. I love you, too. (resolute music) (synth trill)
