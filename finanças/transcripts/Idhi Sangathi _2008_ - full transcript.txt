Lord, your devotees increased in number.. ..and you have completely ignored me. I am even offering you a coconut everyday. But you in return are giving me just a broken coconut piece. Give us money, Lord. A lot of money, Lord. So much money that we can't even count. Turn my husband into a millionaire.. ..who would wear a new coat everyday, lord. - Give it to the sub-editor. - Okay, Sir. You came here to request for a recommendation. Then what's the need to come here in uniform.. ..as if you came to arrest me? In uniform anything can be done easily. Alright. Alright. Which city you said? It's here, but it's of no use, sir. Ok. I will talk to your SP. I will get you transferred to the place of your choice. It's my responsibility, Ok? Sir, I thought if I get myself transferred to a good.. ..police station with your help, then I'd make some money. - That's also right. Do one thing. - What? Come to my home tomorrow morning with 25,000 rupees. - 25,000? - Transfer to Kottapeta is 5,000 rupees. And a transfer to the station of your choice will cost 25,000. A few days ago your colleague Narsingh Rao.. ..was transferred to Bhuvanapuri station. How much did I take? 15,000. It depends on the station. You know that and I too know that. - Make it 20,000, Sir. - Hey, what do you think! You think this is vegetable market to bargain? This is newspaper office. - You are a bird. You are a plane. - Rajyam. Here comes this monkey. So Padma, how is it going? You look very happy. First open your mouth. What is the matter? Did you win lottery or something? Oh God! Don't you think of anything other than money? My eldest uncle is serious. He may die anything. My husband called me and told us.. ..that they are taking him in hospital in an ambulance. You eldest uncle's condition is critical.. ..and distributing sweets? Which doctor prescribed that? That's not the thing, Rajyam. My uncle doesn't have.. ..wife or kids. He doesn't have anyone other than us. But he has 10-12 crores property. - 10-12 crores? - What else do you think? His bungalow in Jubilee Hills Alone would cost more than 4-5 crores. His agency would easily cost 10 crores. And we can't tell you.. ..how much cash he has till we count it after his death. What's the matter? Why are you crying? I felt really bad when such a big person is passing away.. ..without a family member after earning so much money. After all he is a fellow human being. I too can't bear my fellow human beings sorrows. You know that? It's just a small wish.. ..that if he dies we could go to Jubilee Hills. It's not your fault, Padma. One man's misfortune.. ..turns into another person's good fortune. A doctor said so. These are fruits of our good deeds, Swarajyam. Give this sweet to brother. Once we shift to Jubilee Hills you too take.. ..a small house nearby and shift to that place. If we have a outhouse in our bungalow.. ..you can also stay with us. Shall I go now? He will give ma a call. Did you see how irresponsible these doctors are, sir! They said our uncle won't survive. He would die. - I was so worried that he might die. - You weren't worried. You were eagerly waiting for that. Your wife distributed sweets as well in our house. She's too impatient. We can act infront of outsiders.. ..but we are family friends. Sir, God injustice to me. I feel like dying when I think of it. I am dying with hunger for the time being. Hey, I am hungry. Read out fast what you have. - For hearing or for eating? - For beating you. Idli, Vada, Puri, Masala Dosa, Onion Dosa, Uttappam. Except those items everything's there, sir. Except those items or last night's remaining items. Instead of eating here it's far better.. ..to go and eat the crap our wives serve at home. Sir, come. Let's go. Come. Hey, you're so upset because your old man didn't die, right? Every person dies sooner or later. And in the same way you would get crores of rupees. You are a lucky person. I too have some relatives. When they come home I have to pay them the fare. - You mean.. - And you know about my job. After toiling all day long I got a small fry. Sir, that's the reason I say that one must either be.. ..a political leader or a political reporter. We won't get the first post, because other than.. ..you voting for me and I voting for you.. ..even our wives won't vote for us. The second post is correct for you, sir. If you stay as a crime report you might turn into a criminal. Damn job! Even if try to change my jobs now.. ..that editor won't pay heed to me. Our editor. This idiot will live for hundred years. - Like my uncle, sir? - How can I say that! The doctor can tell you about it. It's those doctors who told me when he was a patient.. ..that he might die in a day or two. And I waited with a lot of patience for his death, sir. But it seems that now I might become a patient, sir. He is using me to carry the tiffin boxes. He is even using me to clean his back, sir. - Hello! - Why do you have a cell phone? Can't you pick it up when you get a call? You can't. - Anyway, finally I got you. - Sir. Mumbai Express met with an accident at Kottapeta. You know that? No, you don't. You know where that pig-faced photographer Neeladri is? You don't. Even he doesn't lift the phone when I call him. Take him along with you. Sir, I am going home to have dinner. Such a big accident took place there.. ..and you say you would have dinner.. ..take a nap brush your teeth. What's all this! Don't you have a mind! No, you don't. Don't you have to cover the accident news with photos.. - ..for the city edition? - We don't have to, sir. We don't have to? We have to. There's a dearth of news here. Ok, sir. Ok. To chase the trains at midnight with.. ..empty stomachs we are not porters, but we're reporters. Whatever! Sir, it's not this way. There's a short cut from this way. Sir. Sir. How long has it been since this accident took place? More than half an hour. - What's the number of casualties? - I don't know. - Sir. Sir. Sir. - What happened? It's been a long time since it happened. The rest of the press didn't come yet. Even this time if you don't mention my name.. ..under my photos I won't accept it, sir. Okay, first take photo. - O mother! - Look at this way, girl. Yes I got them. Go. Go. I got them. Hello! Hello! When did the accident take place? How many died? I don't know. You find it on your own. I am already very tensed. Don't add to it. Hey, come fast. Sir! Did you see that! They are running with whatever they could lay their hands on. They are leaving only because a human's flesh is not salty. Or else they would've run away with dead bodies as well. It's salty? You will see your photos in the newspaper tomorrow morning. Where are they? Hey, come, come. Your bad luck. I wanted to help you. You too take it. I didn't mean photos. These. Take these. It's called stealing, sir. And stealing gold from a dead body is even worse, sir. Will you take it if I steal it from there? I will take with my eyes shut, sir. I'm coming, sir. It's for me. Ok. It's so unfortunate, isn't it? - So many people died unnecessarily. - Yes. Yes. What will they get there now! Whatever we earn we have to earn it tonight itself! Do remember me as well, sir. The shares must be equal. - Hey, pull the chain. - Where? Do it fast, or else someone will come here. What will you do with that, sir? Not that chain, but this chain. I wonder how you would survive in this world. - Sir. - I will go into the AC coach. Rich people travel in it. Sir, you go inside. I will guard outside and make sure that no one comes inside. Oh God! Move. Move aside. - Sir, did you get anything? - Hold this first. Give it to me. I will hold it. Get down fast. Thief. Thief. Thief. Thief. - Thief. Thief. - I am not a thief. I am a journalist. - I didn't get hit on the right place. - Thief. Thief. Hey! You keep on taking photos. I will keep them at my home. Sir, you will take both the suitcases? You will one of these two. You can take it tomorrow morning. And thank God that I am also carrying your burden. Sir. Come Fast. If you come late the editor will get mad at us. Ten minutes. Just ten minutes. - I asked you to take photos. - But these suitcases.. You thought I would run away with these suitcases? Rama! Rama! How can you say that, sir! I just thought that you won't be able to carry.. ..these two suitcases alone. Sir. Alright. Alright. Fast. - Here.. - Okay. Both are here, sir. Right. We have reached home. - Hey. Only one of those two suitcases is yours. - Sorry, sir. - Which one shall I take, sir? - Oh God! Neeladri. How would I know, which one consists what? Shut your eyes and mouth and take one between them. We should be discussing at midnight.. ..about stolen suitcases in the middle of the street! Fast. 'Red means danger. I think give it to him.' You take it sir. Sir come fast! Murthy, where did you bring all these from? What's this suitcase! Tell me the truth. These are gold-coated for our girl. Right? Even that you won't bring. Bring the airbag. I need to go urgently. - Tell me what happened. - Mumbai Express derailed. A number of people died. I snatched the chains and necklaces I got. I need to go back. Hey go! So you got a great training in Mumbai Express. - Okay. I am also coming with you. - I am not going for shopping. I know you are going for robbing. - Murthy, its full of gold? - Who knows! How would I know? O boy! You forgot to bring its keys. The owner of this suitcase is lying in the train like a dead body Just look at your face. Look there are 18 bangles, 4 chains and 2 necklaces. You will have to hand them over to me at morning. Take care. Shut down the doors. - Murthy. Murthy. - What? When you will return and bring the fake-key-maker.. ..you will see near the railway station. Don't forget it. - What's that? - My wife gave it to me. Sir. She said to go forth and back again and again that I can't be so greedy. She said it would be enough if I bring a sack-full. You are such a selfish guy. - Why didn't you get two bags? - Oh come on, sir! In Hyderabad city one doesn't even have time to look after oneself. Where would I get time to think about others! Let's go fast. It might dawn. Minister sir. Mumbai Express met with an accident in Andhra. You know it. My brother Dhirulal's suitcase contain diamonds worth crores. It's your responsibility to get me back those diamonds. To fulfill this responsibility I will give you 50 lakhs. Right now in cash. Now it's up to you sir. - Do not worry. - Yes. - Your job will be done. - Yes. I am railway minister's PA speaking. - You will get you share. - Okay sir. Be careful. Take out the diamonds from Dhirulal's.. ..suitcase and throw the suitcase somewhere far away. - We will share the diamond 50-50. - Okay. Deal. Sir. - I am the home minister speaking. - Good evening sir. Trace Dhirulal in AC coach and cease his suitcase.. - ..and send it to me on flight with police escort! - Okay, sir. - You start the work right away. - Then what about my.. Yes. Yes I will consider you for the CBI director's post. You will get your share. I will get 80% of those diamonds.. - ..and you will get 20%. Okay. - Okay sir. Percentage? You will give me. I am the one who will give you. And you are the one.. ..who will take it if I give you anything. - We are in trouble. I think police is here. - Police - Hey. Take care of the ornaments. - Okay. - He gave me on count. - Okay. - Good morning. - It's you? - Yes, it's me, girl. How are you? - Fine, come in. I am sorry, if I woke you up. I called Murthy but the phone was switched off. I thought he might be at home. So I came here. - He didn't come home yet, brother. - I see. - He didn't. - Sit down. Sit Down. Sorry. - Thank you. - Can I get a glass of water? Not too cool. - Ok. - Have it. - Thank you. - Did I disturb you? - Too much. I said you want some more water? It's enough, sister. What's this house you are living in, sister? This is not a house a report should be living in. Ask your husband to earn something. We should make hay while sun shines. I wonder what sort of a reporter he is. Even though reporters have policemen for supporters.. ..your husband is not using them well. You tell him. He won't listen to me. By the way Murthy went to the train.. ..train accident coverage last night, didn't he? Did you bring back something from there? I mean ornaments, gold suitcases.. - He didn't bring anything? - I don't get anything you say. Nothing. It's just a joke. Last night on the train a lot of guys ran away.. ..with whatever they could lay their hands on. I read it in your paper. Of course our Murthy.. ..is not that capable a guy. That's why I joked. Nothing, dear. Some really big personalities in our department.. ..got phone calls from the site of the accident. Something has happened that only upper crust know of. That's the reason I am a bit doubtful. I came to know if Murthy got any whiff of it. If he comes to your contact ask him give me a call. - Yes, Yes. - Goodbye, dear. By the way both of you must come to our place for dinner sometime. We will definitely come. - Ok. - Yes. - Who was it? - It's him. Sur Reddy. Bribe-Addict. He thinks everyone is just like him. Inspite of being a police all his habits are that of a thief. You are right. He repels me as well. Anyway, let's not get bothered about him now. Hey, I have kept all your ornaments there. I haven't taken anything. Shall I help you? You look so beautiful. - Can I wear this one? - Ok. Murthy! Oh. You are sparkling. You would not have looked so beautiful.. - ..if you had worn your own ornaments. - Come on, Murthy! You are casting an evil eye on me. Murthy dear, I have got pendants in ears.. ..bangles in hands, a necklace around the neck. It would have been better if I also had a Vaddanam around my waist, right For a Vaddanam I have to.. ..rob a house where a wedding is taking place. Who wears a Vaddanam on train in these days? Brother, you know my husband is such an idiot. You brought so many ornaments.. ..and my husband left four pairs of bangles and a chain. You should have told him a bit. Please don't mind, but your husband is such a person.. ..who when asked to pull chain would pull the train's chain. I am the one who got even those ornaments for him. We are really born with misfortune, brother. If we were lucky our uncle would have passed away long ago. Anyway, my husband is about to return home. I am leaving. - Alright. - Be careful. You are wearing the ornaments. - Thieves are on the run. - Yes. Serve me the meals. I am feeling hungry. Today I am so happy. I am ecstatic. I am so happy. Everyday when I used to cook food I used to get exhausted. But today even though I am wearing so many ornaments I feel so light. These golden ornaments are so light. Damn this silver water-pot. It's so heavy. And yes. Mr. Sur Reddy came over. He asked you to give him a call. He is such a strange fellow. He joked if you did not bring ornaments and suitcases.. - ..from the train last night! - O my God! He must have doubted me or else he would not have joked. Give me those ornaments. Even in the giant-wheel in exhibitions.. ..they take us on four-five rounds. And you are asking me to remove them so soon? Let me enjoy them for a while. Enough of your enjoyment and give me those soon. Why? You would to give these ornaments to Sur Reddy? Shut your mouth and learn to do what I say. When a policeman's shadow touches our home we should be very alert. You don't know that? Don't you have any sense? - Remove them. - What are you saying? - You brought these for me, didn't you? - For you? Who told you so? This is my earning. I told you a number of times not to talk about my earning. Remove those ornaments and keep them on the table. - No matter whatever you say I won't give you. - Hey! If you ever talk about them anywhere.. ..I will cut you into pieces. He shows off even the goods that he has stolen. On the wedding night when he promised.. ..that he won't left me carry even a little burden I did not get it. Now I understood that he meant.. ..he won't let me carry even a single gram gold on my body. And he did not marry me for free. My parents gave him ten lakhs in dowry. He can at least spend a part of that money.. ..and hire a maid for me. - What do you do? - I am a house wife. - What have you studied? - I am also a housewife. "Housewife" is a beautiful name for a woman.. ..who waste their entire lives doing household chores. - What does your husband do? - My husband can't stay.. - ..away from me even for a second. - Why, girl? Is your husband suspicious? 'He' in heroine. 'Adam in madam. 'Man' in woman.. Even in words these men don't let us be alone. - All these men should be.. - My husband loves me very much. The jewelry on your body tells that. I too have a husband. But what's the use! Sir, tea. Sir. What's the matter sir, your eyes is drowse. Madam did not let you sleep last night or what? Hey, are the details necessary for you.. ..if my eyes came out or went in or my wife did not.. ..let me sleep or my neighbor's wife did not let me sleep? - I will kill you. - Sir, some policemen came for you. Policeman? You did not even kill him and the police has already arrived? Look, I have been following you all these days.. ..and you are my sir, and you in return.. ..made me commit a crime? I am very scared. I will tell the truth to the police.. ..that I have got nothing to do with it. You stole them and I just carried those ornaments. I have not done anything wrong. Keep me out of this. It seems that you would scream out the entire story.. ..even before they ask about it. I will talk there. And I will kill you if you say a word. Sir, please tell them that I was not there that day. Alright. Come. Murthy, DIG came here to ask for both your help. - Prajapatrika. - Who are you? What's your newspaper? A train accident took place and about hundreds of people.. ..residing nearby rushed to help the people stuck in it. And you wrote in this paper that they stole ornaments.. ..they ran way with the suitcases.. ..and that they robbed the entire train. You are insulting the guys who risked their lives.. - ..to save other's lives. - I will be back in a while. What this! Hey, what's going on! Who are you? Why are you shouting? - Who let you come in? - What else shall I say! You should write how the accident took place. You should write how many casualties were there. You should write how the government is helping.. ..the families of those who lost their kin. But you are writing some fabricated stories.. ..and insulting those who helped others. Sir, the photos of those running away with the suitcases. You should write that and it is useful for the people. That is called responsible journalism. Sir. Hey, throw him inside the cell. Thank you, Mr. Satyamurthy. - I need all the photos that you have taken. - Sir. We can catch a number of thieves with its help. - Alright sir. - Sir, I am the one who has taken.. ..the photos over there. Please take these, sir. I will give you all the photos that I have. - I will get all of them caught, sir. - Very good, my boy. - I want all those photos by evening. - Alright, sir. Or else I will throw you inside the cell. - Thank you, editor sir. - Thank you, sir. - Goodbye. - Thank you. I need to talk to you both. You know why an officer of DIG's level came here.. ..for after all those photos? - We didn't get that, sir. - Yes, you won't get them. You know what they have written in this paper.. ..about the incident that took place last night? You don't know. At least have you ever seen this paper? Sir, we don't even our paper. - Why would we read others papers? - You won't read it. Even I don't read our paper. That's why we too don't read it, sir. Sit down. You sat there, right? Hear what I am about to say now. You will hear it, right? Last night in the train, in AC first class a suitcase was lost. In that there were some very costly diamonds. That suitcase belongs to a minister. - Belongs to whom? - Belongs to a minister. That's the matter. That's the reason DIG personally came here. In fist class AC compartment a suitcase with diamonds? Yes. You already know about it? You must know about it. Did you see anyone running away with it? You must've seen him. Come on, quick. The three of us will go there and catch him. All the three of us will get three shares and he will get a share. The third person won't even know about it. Let us make sure that police don't know about it. Police won't open the mouth. It's my responsibility. Whose responsibility is it? Mine. Not three shares, but someone fooled all of us. We saw them running away with suitcases.. ..but we didn't know the it contains diamonds. We wouldn't have left it for him. Had we know that we would've got it even by murdering him. Stay quiet. Ok, then, sir. We shall make a move now. We will be working on it. Neeladri, I've got some urgent work. We shall meet later. - Sir, this is not done.. - Mine having an urgent work? That's not the thing, sir. The suitcase I got doesn't belong to someone who traveled in AC coach. It belongs to the Tc. In that there is a wrinkled black coat few torn tickets.. ..and a stinking underwear. Except those there is nothing in it. You are lucky fellow. There are many poor fellows in our country.. ..who don't have vests and underwears. You should learn to be content. Neeladri. You should take what God gives you, ok? Sir, Sir, Sir. You are God for me, sir. In this world I don't have anyone except my uncle, sir. And I won't get his wealth till he dies, sir. But it seems that he won't die till I die, sir. But what do you want me to do? Kill you uncle? Oh God! I can't say such a thing, sir. Sir, if you get those diamonds in your suitcase.. - ..give me half of them, sir. - Oh God! If I had those diamonds you wouldn't have.. ..got a chance to talk to me for so long. That means he too doesn't have those diamonds. Thank God, he didn't get the diamonds. God, those diamonds should be in my suitcase, please. - Wait a minute. - What's the matter, madam? You'd break it with a stone? Then what am I here for? Wait a minute. Madam, you are praying the lord before opening it? - Is there some fortune in it? - You just open it. Hey, don't open it. Don't open it. I asked you to open the lock and you opened it. That's it. - Here's your fifty rupees. - What's this! You should give me at least 200 rupees.. ..for opening such a costly suitcase without damaging it. 200? Thank God you didn't say 2,000. Take this 100. Give me that fifty. Don't say one more word. Go away. I said go away. Mother Kanaka Mahalakshmi, at least now.. ..stop being upset with me and show me lakhs in it. Mother Kanaka Mahalakshmi, you had mercy on me.. ..after all these days? Oh! Tiny little rascals. Look how they are shining. I called them rascals. Forgive me, Mother. He would be so happy when he sees them. He will be jump in joy and scream Swarajyam, you solved all my problems. He won't be able to control his anger. I shouldn't tell him anything. If I sell these diamonds I would get 2-3 lakhs. I will deposit that amount in the bank. If I tell him he would snatch these as well. There is nothing you don't know, Mother. You know how these times are. Money has the power to separate even a husband and wife. Please my mistake, Mother. - I am back. - Did you call me, Mother? Mummy. - Darling. - Mummy. My, dear. My golden mountain. My diamond sack. Mother, what is this? What are these, mother? These? These are all ours. God has given us there. Don't tell you father. - These are 'twinkle, twinkle, little stars', right? - Yes, dear. Yes, dear. Twinkle, twinkle little stars. They are mine. All these are ours. Give me those. Don't tell your father about it. Do you want ice cream or do you want a chocolate? I want chocolate. I want ice cream. I want stars as well. You took after me, dear. As the prime minister of this country. I take responsibility of the failures. Due to irresponsibility of a cabin man and a signal man.. ..43 people lost their lives. A number of travelers were robbed. Really? You are the prime minister. They robbed even your suitcase. When prime minister's suitcase doesn't have.. ..any security what would happen to the suitcases.. ..of the common people of this country? "This is a corrupted state, brother." "This is the state of the thieves, O Prime minister." - Shut your mouth. - Look there. Hey, turn off that news channel. What would happen to the common people.. ..when prime minister himself is tensed? Not one or two. It's 500 crores that God gave me. Yes, sir. Why did you buy diamonds worth 500 crores.. ..and send them with someone in the train.. ..and that too without my knowledge? I attended the natural calls as well this morning without your knowledge. Sorry. Madam, he feared that if the money is kept at home.. ..he might get caught and so he turned it into diamonds.. ..and handed the responsibility to Dhirulal.. ..to send it to your eldest son-in-law. Since going in planes is a risk the person was asked to carry it in a train. Actually going in train is safe, but our time is bad. That turned into a risk and ruined our lives. He stepped into politics and with great intellect.. ..and he won over his enemies and then suppressed.. ..some of them and with great struggle and hard work.. ..he became the prime minister. But what's the use? He got trapped in a train accident.. ..and he was let down by a small train thief. People must change. The officials must change. Intellects must change. Ministers must change. The entire country should change. First this country's prime minister should change. O Lord of Seven Hills! Lord Venkateshwara! Lord, if I get my diamonds back.. ..I will give you two diamonds in your Hundi. O Shirdi Sai Baba, get me my suitcase. I will get offer you prayers. Tell me if I would become a billionaire. If you give me hundred rupees. Will I become a millionaire? - If you give me fifty rupees. Your husband has come. You came home at this hour? You came home at this hour? What's this? Who unlocked it? The guy who makes fake-keys. I got it unlocked. There is nothing except used clothes, scents, razors.. - ..there is nothing else. - Nothing else? Until we get a new lock it is of no use. - Did you check it properly? - Yes, there was a blade as well. That's not the thing, Swarajyam. Didn't you find anything white, smooth and circular? - Those? - Yes, those. There were a couple of them. By those you mean the naphthalene balls that we put in the clothes, right? - Did you check them properly? - What happened to you today? What happened? That Shani (bad omen).. Its wrong. Call him lord Shani. Yes, lord Shani has settled on my head and hitting centuries. Hey foolish, if you know what had happened.. - ..you would die of heart attack. - Tell me what it is. There are diamonds worth crores in the suitcase.. ..that was stolen from the train that met with an accident. How would we benefit from others wealth! Anyway they are not in our suitcase. - Why they can't be there? - O lord! What happened to you! You relax a bit. Just bringing something home is not enough. We need some luck as well. Officer on special duty. A post with such a long name is of no use for you. - Did you get any information about the suitcase? - Yes. - You got it? - It's not me who got it. - But Asian Times journalist got it. - Okay Okay. Read this. Diamond merchant Dhirulal who was travelling.. ..in Mumbai Express that day met with an accident.. ..had complained that a suitcase containing.. ..diamonds worth crores of rupees was lost.. ..and those diamonds belonged to a top minister.. ..from the cabinet at centre. Officer with a high post, what is this! How do these journalists come to know of things.. ..that we hide so secretively! The diamonds must have gone.. ..But we still have three years time in office. But if my PM post is lost my political career will go down. - Only suicide is the last resort for me. - You are right. O lord of Seven Hills, save me. Rescue me from this deep trouble, Father. Not just two diamonds, but I would offer you 200 crores.. ..in your donation box. Lord Sai Baba or Shirdi, save this Dayanand's name from coming out. You must have a number of devotees.. ..but I will get you Bharat Ratna title.. ..that no one can promise you. - Bharat Ratna Shirdi Sainath. - Only if I am in office. Goons, rowdies and pocket-pullers of this city welcome. Grand welcome. Brothers, I am very happy to meet you all here in this way. As a part of our duty we might have beaten you up in the past. And you might have scolded us. I would like to remind you that the relation between.. ..a thief and a police is like that between husband and wife. - But today's meeting is of great importance. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Long live Club King. - Long live Club King. - Long live Club King. Who is he? He has got such a great following. He is the hero of a stalled film called 'Super Thief'. And now in real life he is stealing superbly. - Greetings, brother. - Long live Club King. King. Club King. Srinivas. S.P. Srinivas. Please sit down. - You man. You all know about the Mumbai Express accident.. ..a few days ago. Those train coaches were robbed. Sir, we have got nothing to do with those train accidents. If you have any doubt on us you should drop that idea. Look, brothers. We know that you have not done this. Please sit down. Please sit down. But in that robbery a red colour suitcase was lost. We came to know that it contains.. ..diamonds worth hundreds of crores. People belonging to the nearby colonies robbed that train. So you attack those colonies and seize.. ..their homes and trash the suspicious people.. ..and get that red colored suitcase at any cost. That's our DGP's order. And we need your support for that. - Alright. - Alright. You have our support. Alright. Alright! But is should look like theft. You can take all the gold, silver and money you get. You give us 30% share that we usually get. We will also give 0.1% share to the person.. Who brings that suitcase with diamonds. Not just that, we would also give him a job.. - ..in the police department. - Long live SP. - Long live SP. Long live SP. - Silence. - Silence. - Long live SP. Silence. But there is a condition. Listen to us carefully. No one should know that these thefts are taking place.. ..with police's support or that we are searching for the diamonds. If this secret goes out we will shoot you.. ..inside your own homes. Sir, your department has our full support. But we can trust anyone except your department. You too know that. - The reason I am saying this.. ..is because, suppose I get that suitcase.. ..what's the guaranty that you would give me my share? This is too much. How can a thief not trust a police and a police not trust a thief! You are taking like a joker, sir. While playing cards even if there is a card show.. ..there is no guaranty that it would be a rummy. I don't trust my fellow thief, then how can I trust police! Okay then. A retired judge will mediate between us, okay? Okay sir. Deal show. Arrange a party for everyone. Okay. - Beer-Biryani granted. - Long live Club King! Long live Club King! Long live Club King! Sir, we are throwing the party and he is getting the credit. - That's the way of the world. - Long live Club King! Long live Club King! Long live Club King! Sir, like the number of tigers, elephants, horses.. ..peacocks is falling drastically, the number of good fellows.. ..is also coming down. Newspapers are not good. TV channels are not good. Journalists are not good. Bad fellows. Evil fellows. How can good people like you.. ..survive among such evil guys, sir! First cut that crap and tell me what happened.. ..about the Asian Times reporter. I will tell you if you get down that horse first, sir. Tonight that Asian Times journalist's time will be over. Excuse me! - He has not died yet? - No. If that suitcase news comes into the newspaper again.. ..the news of your death will be printed in every newspaper. Please sit down. Okay. For your kind information the home minister called.. ..the regular DGP and the regular DGP called the.. ..railway DGP about the suitcase. - You can speak now. - How did he know about it. Through railway minister. Dhirulal told him about it. They know everything about it. No one keeps anything secret in politics. What sort of ministers are they! No. It's my mistake that I sent Dhirulal.. - ..to the railway minister. - Yes. What is done is done, but you keep an eye on home minister. - Okay sir. - Someone is hearing us. They are statues. You got them installed here. You are a bit tensed right. It's quite natural reaction. I can't bear this tension. I don't have any objection to be the mediator. But you know about me. I could not earn too much in my service. So clearly tell me how much you will give me. - You say a price. - No, you tell me a price. How much you will pay me to decide who deserves how much.. ..and give each one their share? How much will you pay me to tilt the dharma on your side.. ..and give you a bigger chunk and lesser chunk to thieves? How much will you pay me to act as the mediator.. ..but pass a verdict which makes you get the whole share.. ..and as per the law the thieves don't need.. ..to be given anything except their daily wage. Package deal. Tell me how much would I get. We will give you five lakh rupees. That won't do. Give me another five lakhs. Okay done. Then we would drop those thieves in the colony.. ..everyday in our vans. After the theft is done we will drop them back at the police stations. Or else there is a danger that they might.. ..run away with everything they rob, Mr.Nirmal Kumar. Right. Right. So our condition is that you have to.. ..travel with them everyday in the van and return with them. We will drop you at your home each morning. So you want me to roam with those thieves as an elderly person. Isthat all? Yes, that's all. Goodbye. Then you should give me a share in what they rob. You should talk to them about it. Bye - Would you like to have a beer, boss? - No. - Then would you like to down a beer? - No, I won't. - Then would you like to drink a beer? - No, I won't. You won't have it, you won't down it, you won't drink it. - Come on, have it! - I am an ex-judge. Give some respect. Greetings, Mr.Judge! So you can roam with thieves like us? - Thieves? Who? - We are going to steal right now. - Doesn't that make us thieves? - How would you be thieves! No one can be called a thief till it is proved in the court. You are yet to steal. Police will have to arrest you once you steal. Then a case should be filed against you. The case must be fought in the court. Only the crime is proved the court should declare you convicts. Till then you can't be called thieves. Superb, Sir. I didn't know that you are such a big thief. And you are a bigger thief. Policemen. Will you catch them? You won't. Will you file a case? You won't. Leave all that. Atleast considering my request give me a small percentage. Sorry, Boss. You will get a share only if you.. ..come to hunting along with us. - Hunting is illegal. I won't come. - But you can eat the preys we kill? - That's not illegal. - Sorry, boss. No work, no pay. Remove your hand, you ugly thief. God is there. He will do justice. Correct. Correct. God is there. - Get down. Get down. - All the best. Look, since both the families went there.. ..both the families have to share equally among us. How can we share equally! Three persons came from our family. Two persons came from your family. So we have to make five shares. Three shares for us and two for you. - One person should get one share. - That's it! There's a fair person. He's right. Two families went to stealing, right? Yes, three persons from our house and two from theirs. And who told you about Mumbai Express accident? I told you. Since I told you about it I should be given two shares. Correct. Correct. Since he gave you the information.. ..about the train's accident he should be given extra share. But who are you to interfere in our shares? I am George Bush. How does it matter who I am? Anyone can do justice to someone. Even Bin Laden can do it. This is your share. This is your share. And this is your share. What's this! You are putting everything at one place. Why? Isn't it right? Then we shall call some more fair people. Some more fair people? Hey, they look like real thieves. Distribute those ornaments among them in the right way. They are robbing away our hard-earned money. Hey, please! Don't take it away. Hey, who else other than thieves do you think.. ..will you come to your home at this hour of night? - By the way, whose house is this? - It's mine. Vaastu is not right. You can't have the entrance on that side. This is what happens if you have it on that side. Okay. A few days ago I told you about the diamonds.. ..lost in the train accident. Do you know the worth of those diamonds? 500 crores only. - 500 crores. - 500 crores? 500 crores? Have you gone mad or what? Just because you were interested in engineering.. - ..I paid the donation. - Daddy, daddy, did you ever see.. ..twinkle, twinkle little star? - We see them every day, dear? Did you ever touch them? They are so far that we can never touch them. No, daddy. - They are there. - You don't find them in bathroom. - You can see them in the sky. - They are there, daddy. Come, I will show you. Come. Your twinkle stars are not in the bathroom. They are there. Twinkle, Twinkle little stars? Oh God! You don't get them here. Please, I am fed up of arranging them. What's this! You will play whatever game she will ask you to play? Daddy, they are there. Daddy, they are there. Hey, what's this! Calm down, girl. Calm down. Don't cry dear. Come. What's this! How can you just slap such a small girl! These days your anger is getting the better of you. Calm down, dear. Let's not talk to mother anymore. Let's go to our room. Oh God! She is not a kid. She is a demon. If I had delayed it even by one more second.. ..I would've got caught along with the diamonds. Yes. Uncle, I know this when he asks.. O money. What do you do? Money says.. I can make Harishchandra lie. - I can make husband and wife fight. - You are right. - Money is really a bad thing. - And I can even.. Mummy, mummy, I want that car. That is poor people's car. It's very small. Let's buy a big one. - Big one? You mean .. ..a bus or a lorry, mummy? That's not the thing, dear. Only daddy.. ..you and I would sit in it. - No one else would be there. - Then we shall buy.. ..and auto rickshaw, mummy. Oh no! Auto? And you won't understand it now. Even though I have so much money.. ..I am unable to buy anything for you. Please don't mind. It's alright, Mom. After daddy and you die I am the one who would get everything. - We would die? - By the time you grew up.. ..grandma and grandpa passed away, right? In the same way you would also become old and die. He who is takes birth on earth will have to die eventually. And when one dies one gives the entire property.. ..and wealth to one's children. That's the ultimate truth. Death is the ultimate truth. You have such a smart girl, my golden doll. It's not gold. It's vajram (diamond). Auntie, we are buying an auto. Just an auto, if you ask your father.. ..he can even buy you a car. - You don't know this? - What? His daddy bought a car just a few days ago. Really? Where is it? Did he go to office on it? It's there. To buy a car with my husband's earning.. ..I have to take another birth. Even that won't be sufficient. Rajyam, till a few days ago I used to watch only tv serials. After this train accident took place.. ..I am watching only news channels. Why? So that you would know about those diamonds? What's the use even if I get to know about them? They won't give us those diamonds, right? - Then? - I am watching if a train accident.. ..has taken at some other place. Train accidents don't place everyday. Listen to me and stop depending on trains.. ..and start offering prayers for your uncle's death. - It won't go waste. - What you are saying is right, Rajyam! One thing is for sure that my uncle will die. Then I will give you a crore. Right now give me a few lentils. Few? Full. She's so nice. Thank God my job is done. Listen to me. I let you take the lead and sent you.. ..inside the coach and this is what you have done? What have I done wrong? How would I know.. - ..which suitcase consists of what! - How would you know? You have to know it. Come here. I'll tell you. Come here. I sent you inside the coach with the confidence that you would find it out. You think I couldn't have gone into it? Our management made you the crime with the confidence.. ..that you would find it out. Why? - You think they couldn't have given me that position? - Leave it. - We were not destined for it. - Shut up! First you make a blunder and then you try to escape.. ..in the name of God, destiny and all that crap. You have to accept your mistake. I don't have a problem if you lose something.. ..with your mistake, but I lost crores of rupees.. ..with your mistake. Who gave you the right to.. ..give me such a big loss? I want an answer. Hey! - Sorry, sir. - How many times will you say that? Aren't you getting bored of it? Even if you get bored of it give me my half once.. ..you get that suitcase, sir. Are you done with it? If you are done with it I will take a leak. Why is he taking a leak so many times! I think there's a new customer. - He's our sir. - Greetings, madam. What ca I do for you? What are the big cars you have? Big cars with respect to size or rate. Show me some cars in high rates. I think she doesn't even know the names of cars. Which car do you want among Nagarjuna's car.. ..Shah Rukh Khan's car and Abhishekh Bachchan's car? Don't you have new cars in your shop? All the cars are new cars here. Nagarjuna's car is Benz. Shah Rukh Khan's car is santro. Abhishekh Bachchan's car is Ford Fiesta. Select one among them. Do you have a car worth one crore? A car worth one crore? If you give me the advance and your address.. ..I will deliver it to your home soon, madam. Soon means within 24 hours? If you pay advance you will get it in 24 seconds. Don't say 'if you pay' but say 'if you like it'. I didn't like your face, nor did I like your car. Why would you like our face? You are of Nagarjuna and Amitabh Bachchan's range. Such an irritating customer. I don't have change, madam. - Keep the change. Oh God. Tape recorder. Theft in a thief's house. Details after the break. Welcome back. In the famous train robber.. ..Mr. Satya Murthy's house a theft took place this evening. But that foolish thief didn't touch the diamonds.. ..worth 500 crores hidden in the kitchen.. ..and took away the cheap tape-recorder in the hall. How would such a worthless thief look after his wife and kids! This is Mr. Satya Murthy's wife Mrs. Swarajya Lakshmi. - Hello! - Hello! - Dear, a theft took place in our house. - In our house? When I went to market a thief broke into our house. - He has stolen the tape recorder. - O My God! Alright. I will go to the police station and file a complaint. Okay. Damn tape recorder. Earlier I didn't have so many ideas. Now that I have got wealth I have getting innumerable ideas. Very good. Swarajya Lakshmi, Very good. Will we get that suitcase or not? I don't know if we would get that suitcase.. ..but your father will surely get caught by the opposition. He is not listening to me these days, sir. Keep your party matter aside. Ever since you lost those diamonds I am unable to throw parties. How would I tell my problems to! Miss, you too want to ask something, right? Go ahead. Or else the flow will be lost. Why are we not getting the suitcase? Because suppose if you get that suitcase. Will you return it? No, you won't. That's the reason. Do you even know who has got that suitcase? Does anyone know whom you hand out with? You couldn't save your own wealth. How can you save the country? Since the railway minister is responsible.. ..for that train accident and that train robbery.. ..you asked him to get that suitcase. Some MLAs of your party came from Andhra Pradesh, sir. They want an urgent appointment, sir. Damn this position! I am not getting enough time even for crying. - Okay. Let them in. - Okay. We are done with this colony. Take this. Distribute this among you all. - Did you get it? - Yes, we got Draupati. Shall we share her? I'm asking about the suitcase. About that red suitcase that contain the diamonds. That suitcase? - Middle-drop for the time being. - You didn't get it? Then say it..I, Club King, swear on Lord.. - ..that I am speaking only truth. - So I will have to show now. I am speaking only truth. You are trying to fool me by giving me the position of God? It's God who has given me a blow, or else.. - Tell me. - I don't know, sir. I don't know. - Tell me. - No, sir. Suri, is he a pickpocket or a chain-snatcher or is it a guduma case? He is from the next level. He is a train robber. In Mumbai Express! Instead of saving those who were injured in that accident and was screaming for help he was stealing their ornaments and watches.. Sir, such fellows should not be interrogated or brought to jail.. ..or the court..such people should be shot dead. If you don't mind can I too give him a thrashing? Sir, I think I saw you somewhere. Shall I wait for sometime or shall I come sometime later? Why would you wait, Murthy? Ramulu. - Sir. Come here. Take this. - Giving him a thrashing. - Sir, I really don't know anything. - Sir. Sir. - Tell me. - Tell me. - Sir, please. Murthy, so tell me what brought you here. I am telling the truth, Sir. When Rajyam went to market.. someone stole the.. ..tape-recorder from our house. I wonder how anyone can steal others' belongings. That's the reason they you don't It till you go through it. No, It's nothing. To these journalists who write.. ..just anything about the inefficiency of the police.. ..we appear like Gods when they are in trouble. You are Gods. You are really Gods. Sir, please do something about my tape-recorder. - I have filed a complaint as well. - Give me four days' time. I will either get back your tape-recorder.. ..or I will get you someone else's tape recorder, okay? It's fine if you get my tape-recorder and if you don't.. ..then why don't you give me a laptop, if you don't mind. You don't mind, but I am afraid that is not possible. We can only give you what you've written in your complaint.. ..if we can't find the one you lost. But we can't get you something other.. ..than you what you lost, Murthy. Why didn't you tell me that before? Anyway get me the tape-recorder.. ..but a costlier one and a new one. We get what we are destined to get. One can't even get back the diamonds.. ..lost in the train accident, then what is this tape-recorded! No diamonds, nothing. It's all trash. - Someone started a rumor. - I too thought the same. If really diamonds worth 500 crores were lost.. ..then there would have been such a huge scene out there. Have a cup of tea. - No. I am getting late. I shall go now. Sir, I am telling the truth. Hey, don't forget about my tape-recorder. - Alright. Get me an imported brand tape-recorder. - Sony or Samsung. - Okay. A costlier piece would be great. - Sure. - Okay then..- Sir. Sir. - I saw him in S4 coach in Mumbai Express. - Rascal!. Hey, today he is saying he saw me there. Tomorrow he will say I have stolen something there. File the theft case in my house on his name. He will learn his lesson. Goodbye. You carry on. Hey! - Sir. Where did you see him? I saw him in S4 of Mumbai Express that derailed. What were you doing there? - I was chanting.. - Chanting.. I wonder when we would encash them.. ..without the knowledge of the third party.. ..and when we would buy a bungalow and a car. We shall go to Mumbai and open a diamond store. Siri Diamonds. Rajyam, we will get back our tape-recorder. Not exactly ours, but police would give us.. ..another one in its place. How come? It's very simple. They will catch a thief and make him buy it.. ..and if needed they will make him steal once again.. ..but they will get us a tape-recorder. What more we can ask for? What do you say? Won't I get a gift for that? Another good news for us that the theft of Dhirulal's diamonds.. ..is nothing, but a lie. So we did not lose anything there. 'And those diamonds? Are they fake diamonds? O lord, how can you do this to me! I have even named my diamond shop in Mumbai Siri Diamonds. Several MLAs from Andhra Pradesh.. ..met prime minister today and he promised them.. ..that the reigns will be given to someone else pretty soon. We won't be able to live like CMs of opposition parties live in other states. Sir, I settled the matter of Dhirulal and that English paper's reporter. - Well done. - Andhra's CM is waiting, sir. - Let him in. - Okay, sir. Sir, sir is calling you. After making us sit outside for three hours.. ..he will ask us how long has it been since we came! - Greetings, sir. - Come in. Come in. Sit down. - How long has it been since you came here? - Just a while. So what is the general perception about me.. ..among the people of Andhra Pradesh? They are proud of the fact that a Telugu boy would grew.. ..in dingy lanes is now the prime minister in Delhi. Don't they have anything else to do? - Stop lying and tell me what the matter is. - You know what it is. A fraction in our party is conspiring against me.. ..to bring me down from CMs post. - You know how many headaches I have? - 500 Headaches. I am dying here with so many headaches and you are giving me a new headache. That state is as big as an island. Can't you keep everything in control? Who can keep everything in control, sir? You know how hard it is to control everything even at home. You mean not just making you a CM but it is also my duty to make it sure.. ..that no one throws you out of that chair, right? We shall do one thing. I will quit PM's seat.. ..and become your security guard. When he has given us life he would definitely show us a path to survive! That's what I say. I had not made you CM then you would not have come to me today with this problem. Since you are the one who started it you have to solve it now. If I am not here he won't understand what you say. - Tell me what it is. - Keep politics aside. I am living under your shelter. You have to hand me over the responsibility of that suitcases. Don't ask me how and why I know it. I will find that suitcase at any cost.. ..and offer it at your feet as fee to my master. What if you don't get it? - If you give him three years life.. ..he will bring 500 crores in a flower basket for you. Mr.Omkareshwar Rao.. - Sure. Sure. If I stay in position then keep flowers aside.. ..I will send them in flower-plane. - Thank god you did not say train. - Right. Okay then we are partners from now onwards. Till I am the PM in Delhi you will be the CM in Andhra. And I am the PM with you. I mean personal manager. Lord, PM is very disturbed with that suitcase. The sooner we get it the better for the country. It's Lord Bhairava's wish. We have to worship him nonstop for 48 hours. - And that would cost two crores. - Two crores? It's very less, isn't it. Then add one more crore to it. We have to perform a vow at 108 places simuntaneously. We will have to sacrifice atleast three lives for lord Bhairava. We have to make those sacrifices.. ..at the place where the train accident took place. Human sacrifice means we have to kill someone, Lord. Bhairava! Bhairava! You kill someone with a gun and call it an encounter in the same way.. ..when we sacrifice a lot for Lord Bhairava it can't be called a murder.. ..it is the holy sacrifice. To get those diamonds worth 500 crores.. ..you will have to do what we say. I don't want to hear anything. Please don't get angry, Lord. We will do everything as per you wish. Not just human sacrifices, but even if you ask for pigs.. ..we would be ready to sacrifice them. By the way whom shall we sacrifice? Will thieves do? Will naxalites do? Will the people of human right organisation do? Even police will do. Send me an advance of one crore. I will start the prayers tomorrow morning. Get the men ready by the night after tomorrow. I will give you the auspicious turmeric threads. You have to strangle them with those threads. After killing them you have to leave them on the racks. You will have to take care of those who are sacrificed.. ..and also those who sacrifice them. If there is a case on that I am not responsible for it. It would be better if DGP does it himself. - What! - I won't do it with my hands. - If required replace him. Appoint someone in his place who would be ready to do this job.. - ..first of all send the suitcase. - Alright. - Miss. Rajyam, how are you? - Fine, please sit down. He doesn't have anything to do at home. He came here early in the morning. Boring fellow. Rajyam, bring coffee for Chandram as well. - I won't waste milk for him. - So what's the matter? Anything special? How come you came here so early in the morning? I came here regarding some case after meeting Surya Reddy. I too met him last night to file a complaint.. ..about my stolen music system. He promised me that he would arrange another one for me. Hey, you know this! The diamonds aren't stolen. Surya told me. And if such costly diamonds are lost how can anyone not file a complaint. Yes, that is possible. If it is the black money.. - ..he cannot file the complaint. - That's not the thing. The diamonds merchant himself gave a statement.. ..that he didn't lose any diamonds. What sort of a crime reporter are you! Didn't you read today's paper? That diamond merchant died with heart attack. And the reporter who wrote the news in Asian Times.. ..has also died in the accident. Both are murders. How can you not know that? You are right. All this seems to be a high level scam. World rotates on its axis and revolves around sun, is science. And world on its axis and revolves around rich men is reality. Chander Rao is a fool. He always gives us a crap about ethics and morality. But today what he said is absolutely right. This is a very costly area. For the rent we would pay.. ..they won't even let us put a tent here. Auto, stop there. Take it back. We came here to look for a house on rent.. - ..but not to buy it. - You wait a minute. Once your uncle dies you won't have.. ..to worry about tents and rents. You will own a house. And what's the harm in just checking it out? It's good for us if we fix on a house beforehand. You need planning for everything. Planning. It must be about 4-5 crores, right? We don't have hundreds of crores. We just have a hundred rupees note. Please come. Let's go. - Yes, madam. - We came to see the house. - Please come in, madam. - Listen to me. - Please come in, madam Madam, your visiting card. - Card. Card. It's my fault that I told you that my house owner.. ..asked me to vacate the house. And then coming with you on house hunting spree.. It's my mistake. Oh God! She looks like Phoolan Devi. Come, let's go. Sit down. Yes, please. There's a 'house for sale' board outside your house. Isn't our watchman there? He should've told you everything. It will cost five crores. Do you want to see the house? - We did come to see it. - But not to buy it. First we have to see it. - Hey! - Yes, madam. Show them the house. Okay, madam. Hey, tell them to leave their sandals outside. Call your madam once. Why? - Let her come here. How's the house? - It's cold. Do you have an AC? The house is fine. Why do you want to sell it? Is there some Vastu problem? - Property problem or money problem? - Money problem? The money is too much and the house is too small. That's why we are building a bigger house somewhere else. What other problem can we have! You are saying five crore rupees. There's no wooden flooring. There's no swimming pool as well. We can't build all those for you now. Those who like it will take it. What's the need to.. Okay, then, we will also build a big house as we like. Okay, then, but do buy better sandal's for yourself. It's simple living, but not poverty, aunt. Arrogant woman. How arrogant she is! She sent her guard to show us the house. If felt like hitting her with the same old sandals. What's the use in scolding her, Rajyam! Shouldn't we come bit decked up.. ..when we are coming to negotiate such a big house? You should've at least worn the ornaments.. ..your husband brought a few days ago. You would've looked like something.. - I would've looking like nothing. - That Murthy.. Your husband took away ball the ornaments? - Yes, he took them away. - And you said nothing? Actually what happened is that.. Where is she? - Hello! - I need to talk to you. Yes, tell me. - Sit there first. - You won't tell me what it is till sit here? You are talking too much. When did I talk too much? You got this job with the dowry I gave you.. ..and with my father's recommendation.. ..and you can't perform even a simple task? At home there are maids to do household chores cooks to cook. - What else do you want? - What about my physical needs? Because of the problem in you I didn't have kids yet. What to do with this life without kids and without diamonds? It's fine if you get me diamonds within a week.. ..or else I will have to give you a divorce. Be careful. Government gives us a salary not to bring.. - ..diamonds for our wives. - I don't know all that. Will you bring diamonds or do you want me to die? That can't kill you. I was just kidding. Foolish woman, listen to me with a cool head. As soon as I get that diamond box I will take away those diamonds.. ..and keep some duplicate diamonds in them. There would be no problem then. You made such a big plan? I didn't know your plan and said mean words to you for no reason.. - Ok, erase those words. - You are always like that. Come, I will teach you a lesson. 'When assets increase needs increases.' 'When increase expenses increase.' 'When expenses increase the earning should also increase.' 'With the diamonds we have we can ten such..' 'Not just then, we can open hundred such shops.' What do you want, lady? Can I meet shop's proprietor or the manager? I am everything. Look, girl, we don't have any job right now. - But I have some.. - Sorry.. My name is..My name is Sulochana Rani. - I write novels. - Great. But I don't read novels, girl. Even if people don't read them the writers.. ..can read them and sell them. Writing novels is not a crime. Yes, tell me what brought you here. There is a character in my novel. She gets a fortune in which she gets diamonds.. ..worth hundreds of crores. She thinks that instead of selling them.. ..it would be better to open a diamond shop. It's a novel. She can think anything. For a minute forget that this is a novel. Suppose I got those diamonds. What should I do? Do I need to have a license for this? Whom should I apply? What will be the fee? How much would it cost for these showcases and furniture? What would be the rent of the shop? What is the deposit amount? Tell me such things. Do you have work so hard to write a novel? You can write it the way you want to. Who is coming to question you about it? I am not a writer who would write just about anything. Until and unless I do some deep research on something I don't write on it. When we would sell or buy.. ..gold and diamonds we need to know their worth. How do we know that? In this business what are the profits like? I want such information. Once I shut down this business I will write down a complete book. In that book you will get all the information you need, girl. It's my business hours. Let me do my work, girl. Come here next Tuesday. Excuse me till then. Thanks a lot. I will come here tomorrow Tuesday morning. Morning means our shop opens only after 10 O'clock. Goodbye. Great customer. Giving you your share is quite common.. ..but these days you are taking a share more than your share. You don't even care that I am DIG's brother-in-law. Then don't pay me from now onwards. No, No. You will trap me some rape case.. - ..and play with my reputation. - Good. You understand the benefit of giving us our share. You are not ordinary people. Ok, tell me coffee or tea? Who would drink coffee and tea in such a hot day? Would you have a cold drink then? It's been a long time since I stopped having cold drinks. - I got it. Hey! - Sir. - Bring a cold beer from the fridge. - Okay, sir. - How is the business running? - Everyday new model.. ..big cars are coming to the market. Who would buy these small cars now? A few days ago a lady asked if I have a one-crore car. These days everyone is earning crores of rupees.. - ..in real estate business. - No real estate or bullshit? Her husband is a journalist. She gave me her visiting card as well. Where is it? Here it is. This is Satya Murthy's card. How did that lady look like? She fair, tall and beautiful. Hey, bring the beer. - I am on duty, sir. I can't drink. Thanks, I have got some urgent work. Goodbye. Keep it back in the fridge. In addition to extortion money every month.. ..he takes a beer at this hour of the day. That person said he is not a thief but he's a journalist. I saw him in S4 coach of Mumbai Express.. ..that met with an accident. O evil friend, you made such a big scam.. ..even without my knowledge? From crime reporter you reached a position ..where you would commit a crime. Don't you have a costlier scotch? Even scotch has a name, right? Give me the name of the scotch you want. You don't need to know the names. A few days ago a woman came to our shop.. ..and asked for one crore car. She didn't give me car's name. She asked for a one crore car? Who is she? From the card she gave me she is just a crime reporter's wife. Two women came to our house as well to buy our house. One of them was quite arrogant. She too gave a card in which it was mentioned.. - ..that her husband was a crime reporter. - Bring that card. Brother-in-law, I too have a small doubt. Even when I told your CI Sur Reddy he.. ..too made a similar doubtful face. And then he left hurriedly with that card. She is not a terrorist, is she? I will tell you in a while if she is a terrorist or not. This is her card. See this card and tell me if the card you gave him is also similar. Same to same, brother-in-law. - Murthy, Murthy. - What? Look someone is knocking the door. - Who's that? - It's me, Sur Reddy. - What happened? - What happened? First of all open the door. - What? - What? Where did you keep that red suitcase? You came here in a drunken state and creating a scene. You go home. We will talk tomorrow morning. What's there to talk at morning! We will have to clear everything right now. - That's your bedroom, right? I will show you..- Suri.. Have you gone mad or what? What's this? I am not the one who has gone mad. But it's you. How dare you push me! Move aside! I am leaving you only because you are my friend. Go away. You dared to raise your hand on a CI? Come to the police station. I am arresting you. - You are arresting me? - Yes. First of all I will file a complaint on you. - Come. - Come. You will file complaint against me? You don't worry about me. Bolt the door from inside. He says he will file a complaint against me. - Let's go. Police has become a joke - for everyone these days. Come with me. I will tell you what happens if you raise hand on policeman. I want daddy. I want daddy. Mother Kanaka Mahalakshmi only you can save us. - Daddy. - Siri, don't be scared. I don't want any diamonds. If we are safe and secure that's enough for us. Daddy. Who can rescue us now? Daddy. - Daddy. - Chandar Rao. - Daddy. Hello, is this Mr. Chandar Rao? - I am Swarajya Lakshmi. - Yes, tell me. You must come to our immediately. What happened? Why are you crying? You come to my home immediately. - Okay, I am coming there right away. - Okay. Did Neeladri tell you? How does it matter who told me! You look so innocent. But I have not seen a bigger scoundrel than you? Not one or two. You stole diamonds worth 500 crores. What are you saying! First you steal diamonds.. ..and then you file a complaint that someone stole.. ..something in your house? God! You are very dangerous. Suri, it's true that I stole there. And that too when everyone.. ..over there were stealing I got carried away.. ..stole some ornaments and a red suitcase. But there was nothing in it except safari suits. You can take them if you wish. Really! So magnanimous! You will take the crores and give me the suits? Trust me. Your wife goes to the car companies.. ..and enquire about the cars worth crores and book orders and you ask ..me to believe you like a fool? Hey, police station is that way. - Where are we going this way? - To your father's house. To mortuary chamber. Get down. - Get down. - You are a foreign tourist. I will show you. Come. - Hey, where did you bring me to? - Where? Don't try to act smart with me. Move I will show you. Move. Sit down. Sit down. Look we give respect even to the.. ..big criminals at first. In the same way you have to confess where those diamonds are. We will leave you. - Or else.. - Or else you will shoot me? Shoot me. No. No. No. No. I am fed up of shooting people in fake encounters. I will.. Till you speak out the truth I will cut every part of your body one by one. First of all I will cut your little finger. If you still don't tell me I will cut another finger. And then.. Sell them. It would be better. You won't get anything better. I know you won't tell me the truth.. ..even if I cut each and every part of your body. Quite natural. Even if you don't have legs and fingers.. ..you can live easily with 500 crores. You are not tensed anyway. And I can't get rid of this tension. I am going to.. Hey, Murthy! Don't do this to me. I will help you, brother. I will get you out of this trouble. Give me my share. You can take the rest of it. I won't mind it. In this hopeless job.. ..I have not earned anything except beer bottles. With God's mercy I found you like God. I touch your feet. Tell me where those diamonds are. No one other than you and me knows about it. We can live happily. Please, brother. Please. You are not a good policeman.. ..but you can become a good politician. How many times do I have tell you! I am telling you again, Swarajyam opned that suitcase. And there were no diamonds in them. - Your wife opened that suitcase? - Yes. Oh God! These women have really grown leaps and bounds. I brought you here unnecessarily. You are a waste tourist. I will go to your home. Good idea. Hey! Hey! Hey, Suri. Hey! Hey! Hey, Suri. Hey. I won't give you a share in it. Suri, open the door. After whatever happened it's not safe for you to stay here. You should change your place immediately. Do one thing. You pack your luggage and come with her. I will be waiting in the car. Quick. Miss.Swarajyam, did you bring the diamonds? Those are the roof cause of all these trouble. Leave them. Miss. Swarajyam, we think we are pretty samrt. But policeman are far smarter than we are. They search every nook and corner. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen.. They don't even leave the septic-tank. Then I can't help you in any way even if I want to. Then it's up to you now. Oh, Puncher! Damn! Auto. Auto. Boy, go fast. Malkajgiri. Leave me. Who are you? Who are you? Leave me. Put her to bed there. Mrs. Swarajyam, now we are in safe place. You can take rest. And what about him? You don't worry about Murthy. This trouble shall pass. You will get out of it somehow. But I can never forgive you. He stole suitcase and ornamnets.. ..but you stole diamonds at once. I hate myself now. Hey, you think robbing 500 crores is a joke? If I hit you with a joke it will become tragedy. Got it? Sir. Brother-in-law, did you see.. ..he is saluting me even in this position! You saw how disciplined our CI is. Sir, I don't know where those diamonds are. He too does not know. I doubt that they are with his wife. Sir, if they are really there with my wife.. ..i will definitely bring them to you. Your wife is not there anymore. Give them a warm bath and.. ..three pegs brandy to each.. ..with some food and then let them sleep. After they wake up they will tell the truth. Hey, no one will raise a hand on them in my absence. They will tell the truth. Once they tell the truth we will give them their shares, okay? Hey, that CI can't be trusted. It's up to you now how you would extract.. ..the truth about diamonds from him. That's alright, brother-in-law, but what happened to Satyamurthy's wife? Like we kidnapped them someone must have kidnapped her. - Who must have kidnapped her? - Policemen. DSP. SP. IG. - Yes, that SP must have done it. - SP? Yes, how can he kidnap someone inspite of being a police officer? When you can kidnap two persons inspite of.. ..being a DIG, What's wrong if SP kidnaps one person? There's no use even after bringing so many people.. ..into the battlefield. - We come across corrupted officers at every step. - Yes sir. - Whom do we trust here? - This won't do. But we have to cancel the program for a week. Let's go to Hyderabad and return with suitcase. Shall I pack the suitcase at early morning? - I mean with clothes and brushes. - Do it then. - Then you play with the balls till morning. - Alright. Good morning. Sorry. I think I disturbed you. No, you didn't. - I brought coffee and tiffin. - Thanks. I am going out. If you want something you can take it from the kitchen. I will meet Sure Reddy and bring Murthy here by afternoon. You need not worry here at all. And yes, I forgot to tell you, don't pick the phone. And you too don't make any calls. - And he..- Don't worry. I will take care of everything, ok? Did you see what sort of a woman Satya Murthy's wife is? She stole prime minister's diamonds.. ..and hid them even from her husband and fooled him. She fooled all the policemen as well. She is getting scorned by all the innocent women like you. What is she doing with so many diamonds? We wouldn't have said anything if she had give us our share. She doesn't have a limit to her greed. Evil woman. Police arrested Satya Murthy? If one makes a mistake then not just Satya Murthy.. ..even Satya Harishchandra in his place would be arrested. One can't get away after stealing ornaments from dead bodies You are right, sir. - This is what happens if you betray your fellow human beings. - Correct Now police had set their sight on his friend. Sir, what should I do now? I don't care if I lose my reputation but I would lose my job as well. And if I lose my job my wife would divorce me, sir. But police won't leave her. - They will arrest your wife as well along with you. - What? Police arrested sister Swarajyam! Oh God! I told you that we shouldn't take stolen jewelery.. ..and that the wealth we would inherit from your uncle's death.. ..would be enough, but you didn't listen to me. What will I do if police arrests me now! You don't need to do anything. They will do whatever is needed. You used to wear ornaments and walk like a model on Fashion TV. I never walked like that. You used to walk even worse. Shut up! Don't cry. I am already crying here. Sir, you are a lawyer. Only you can save me from this case. Not just you, but I have to save Satya Murthy and his wife as well. That's the reason I came to you. - Sir, I have a small doubt. - What's that? Sir, how did you come to know.. ..that I am also in it along with Satya Murthy? You are the ones who covered the news before others did. Is that all needed right now? No, there is no need for that now, sir. Go. Go and bring the ornaments. Neeladri, police arrested Satya Murthy and his wife.. ..but they didn't file an FIR. That means they kidnapped them. To get them out we have to file a petition called on police. Let's do that, sir. But is there danger to my life from that, sir? You are already in danger. That petition is make sure that you both are not arrested. Tell me, sir, where shall I sign. I will sign there. - Dear. Do I have to give these two chains as well? If you don't give them police will put such thick iron chains.. ..around your neck and take you away, will that be ok? There is no need for that I will give you these two chains as well. That's enough. You may go now. Take it. You can keep it. You mean you are giving me partnership in this. No, don't get me wrong, sir. You hand these ornaments to police somehow.. ..without taking my name. If we give these to police they will distribute them among themselves. I will hand them over in the court. Sir, don't get angry that I am asking this again. Who told you that I stole these? Does someone have to tell me? You have got some face value. No use, brother-in-law. I don't think they know anything about the diamonds. Look there, our men have tired beating them up. Now they are saying that they won't beat them till they get a raise. We are wasting time, brother-in-law If we get that girl our job will be done. What you are saying is right. She didn't even tell her.. ..husband about those diamonds which proves that.. ..she must held someone else's hand for help. If we hadn't had arrested Sure Reddy and Murthy.. ..she would have killed Murthy along with her boyfriend. Correct, brother-in-law. That must've happened, 100%. We need to catch him urgently right now. We're getting a new character each day in this case. And by misfortune is that prime minister is in this city itself. He is giving me a hard time for the diamonds,.. ..and here your sister wants those diamonds to make a golden waist-ban It's a tragic tale of husband and wife and prime minister. Shall we leave them then? If we leave them we will be inside the bars. What shall we do then? What we will do is find a suitable day.. ..and kill them and throw them near the bus-stand. When Swarajyam was trying to elope with her boyfriend.. ..Murthy reached the bus-stand with his friend Sure Reddy. At the bus-stand she killed Murthy with her boyfriend. They killed our CI Sure Reddy as well.. to leave no witnesses behind. How's my story? You should've been in the jail, brother-in-law. Accidentally you are in a job where you send people into the jail. Hey, you! Mother, whose house is this? Where is father, mother? Why are you crying? Lord, look after him wherever he is Please take all those diamonds and give us our lives back, Lord. Mummy, don't cry. It looks like you cried a river. Mr. Chandar Rao, here are the diamonds. Hand them over to police and bring my husband back. I don't need money. I don't need cars and bungalows. I want my life back. My husband, my daughter and me! That's enough for me. Police needs diamonds and also the thieves along with that. Because of these diamonds I lost the peace of my mind. Please, Mr. Chandar Rao, keep them with you. You want me lose the peace of my mind. Mr. Chandar Rao, please, please. Dreams of past, tears of present day.. Till I give these to police keep them with you. Take them. America in atomic power, China in population.. - ..India in corruption, are leading - Claps. Stop it. Stop it. Instead of dying with shame you are clapping.. ..because we are leading in something. These are not my words are prime minister of India. - It's something mentioned in the newspapers. - Sorry, sir. - What we need is not corruption. - Diamonds. - PA - Diamond like people. Congrats, sir! We traced the people who stole your suitcase. We will catch them today itself. You keep them with you and send me the diamonds. And one more thing, this matter shouldn't get on record.. ..should be out on newspapers and the opposition.. - ..shouldn't know about it. - Okay, sir. I will take care of it - Now the meeting came to and end. Claps. - They or me? Everyone. How is he? How could a person in police custody be? All these happened because of me. Don't cry, Mrs. Swarajyam. I am about to tell the court.. ..that police has arrested your daughter and you as well. Murthy will come out in just 2-3 days. Okay, I am going out. I might not return this night. These are for your daughter. Magazines for you to while away time. And Biryani for dinner. Shall I go now then? Goodnight. Mummy, I want ice cream. Madam, give me some alms. - Who are you? - My name of King of clubs. We don't have rice in our house. If you tell me where the rice box is I will take some rice. Rice box? This is not our house. Our rice box would be in our house. - Why would it be here? - Mrs. Swarajya Lakshmi.. ..rice box and rice in the box are there in your house. But the diamonds..diamonds worth crores are not there. They belong to our country's prime minister. He called me and told me that the diamonds are.. ..with Swarajyam and asked me to bring them. Do you remember once a tape recorder.. ..was stolen in your house? On that particular day I saw diamonds in your rice box. Since I was stealing in policemen's account.. ..I would've had to give them a share in that. That's why I left them there are I thought.. ..they would be safe in your house. Since police is searching for you right now.. ..it would be dangerous if you keep diamonds with you now. That's why I came to take them away Mr. Chandar Rao said that he will give those diamonds to the police, - ..and they will hand them over to the prime minister. - They won't! They will kill you and share them among themselves. Listen to me and give me those diamonds. I won't. We will hand them over to the police. You won't listen to me if I ask you so politely. I will kill you and take them away. You are a dead man when Mr. Chandar Rao comes here. You should be alive till then. And what will you do with those diamonds once you are dead. Go and bring them. Uncle, do you want chocolate? Take it. Very good. Your daughter is a wise girl. I will hand them over to the prime minister.. ..and make her children welfare minister.. ..and you women welfare minister. Goodbye. It's hot Biryani here. I am dying with hunger. Get one more Biryani with Chandar Rao. I will have this one. I love you. Swarajyam, you are such a big fool. - Swarajyam? What's that ugly name! - Shut up! Rajyam darling, don't you know that there is.. ..someone called Chandar Rao in this world? Chandar Rao is a good fellow. He is good soul. He knows how to cash his reputation. Murthy will die anyway. After eating that Biryani.. ..Swarajyam and her daughter will also die. If I throw them on the railway track.. ..no one will know who kill them and how they were killed. But Chandar Rao will become a millionaire. He will become a millionaire. (indistinct railway anouncement) Come tomorrow morning, madam. I need to meet them urgently. - It's not possible. - Please. - I am telling you. - Just once. - It's not possible. Just once, please. - Security. - Yes, ma'am. - You come in. Please go inside. Come in. Will you please give me a glass of water? Here it is. What! Did you come to buy my house. With the diamonds you got.. ..you can buy not one, but hundred such houses. And also these days it's thieves like you, are ruling. Look, do not hurt me because of what I did in the past. Police arrested my husband. Then you will give me those diamonds.. ..if I release your husband. Where are those diamonds? Give me. I will bring back your husband right now. Quick. I don't have those diamonds, but I know where they are. If he reaches our home safely I will tell you where they are. You can take them. You devoured the diamonds without your husband's knowledge. How do I trust you? Atleast for the sake of those diamond's you have to trust me. For my husband's sake I have to trust you. Mummy, I am feeling hungry. For people like you money has become more important than the money. I have not seen people like you who don't have any morals or values. No matter however locations you change.. ..there is only one thing we would say. We don't know. Mr. Naidu, keep this Satyam Murthy with you and leave me. Give me just one day's time. I will find out those diamonds along with his wife. Trust my word. And if I can't you can kill me. Please just for one day. Remember the help we did to each other all these days. For friendship sake. Correct. For friendship sake. There is your husband. He got thrashed a bit.. - ..but still he is safe. - Daddy. Please don't mind, sir. They tied my hands. Or else I would have saluted you. I am a sinner. Because of the mistake I did you faced hell. - Forgive me please. - You can talk about all that later on. If you tell me where those diamonds are.. - ..I will leave both of you. - What about me, sir? I have hidden those diamonds with Chandar Rao. He is at his farmhouse. He will give you those diamonds. Are you sure? Brother-in-law, I am going there. I will call you, if she said turns out to be false. Kill all of them along with that child. And look after their meals, and also get milk for that child. Take care. - Hello! - Hey, Listen to me carefully. - Yes, brother-in-law. - I am going to meet Chandar Rao. Kill them if I get the diamonds.. ..and kill even if I don't get them. Anyone who has seen those diamonds or knows about.. ..those diamonds is alive we will be in trouble. Okay, brother-in-law. Please hire me as the driver for your one crore car. I will drive it. I see. You did not like my face, right! Now you won't like my brain as well. That's right. You think you have got great brain.. ..but I have not seen such a big fool till now. Your brother-in-law will snatch those diamonds.. ..from Chandar Rao and then he would kill him. And to keep that matter a secret all of us will have to die. He will give you a call and you will kill all of us. - That's right, isn't it? - That's right. And then he will file a case against you.. ..that you killed all of us and he will send you to the jail. Then I will tell the entire story to the police. That's why you are also threat to your brother-in-law. He will kill you as well. Hey, I am going out on some work. Don't leave them. Kill them if I ask you to and leave them if I ask you to leave them, okay. Alright, brother. He is going to take away those diamonds. Did he even pay you your daily wage? Daily wage? When he would get 500 crores.. ..he should give them a share in that amount, right? Hey, come! Siri. Come; let's go. Hey, don't do this to me. If you untie me I will also try to get a crore from those crores. Hey, friendship is more important. Hey, isn't friendship important to you? Hey! Get up. It's me. How can you sleep in peace! Sorry, sir. I could not find that out. Had I known that I would have definitely told you about it. - I told you so many things, didn't I? - Yes, you did. You asked me to change CBI's director, I did that. You asked me not to change the chief minister and I did not change him. You asked me to talk to change some useless people and I did that. Shall I tell you something? My advice for you is to do whatever the lord of seven hill tell you now. O lord seven hills, please help me stick to my PM post. Make sure that you stick to your towel for the time being. If you wish you can take all the diamonds worth 500 crores. Hail the lord of seven hills, lord Venkataramana! Govinda, Govinda! In Tirumala an unidentified devotee has donated diamonds.. ..worth 500 crores in lord Venkateshwar's donation box. The temple authorities said that by far.. ..this is the biggest donation given by a single devotee. Let's take a short break now. I am inconsequential compared to you, lord. Hail the lord of seven hills, lord Venkataramana! Govinda, Govinda! - Special officer. - Yes, sir. I pledged lord Saibaba of Shirdi.. ..that I will get the Bharat Ratna title bestowed upon him.
