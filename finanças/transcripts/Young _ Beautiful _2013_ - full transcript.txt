What? Felix is looking for you. You saw him? He stopped by the house. Did Mom see him? Yeah. What'd she say? That he's handsome. Promise not to tell Mom. Okay. Why don't you tell her? It's my life. I'm sure she wouldn't mind. Too many questions. "What's he do? How'd you meet?" Are you in love? Come on, Isabelle! Tell me. Do you think he's cute? I don't know, I'm a boy. Let's clear up. Kids, give me a hand. - Naptime, honey. - Come swim, Victor! We'll swim after we clear up. Mom, can we swim? Not yet, you have to digest. Come on, Mom! You can go after naptime. We're not babies any more! I'm not a baby but I still nap! Stop it! Let me go... Your German friend stopped by. I know. He seems nice. Felix? Invite him to dinner. He's too dumb. See him? Yeah, there. Where? Down by the waves. There. See him? Let's go. Really? Sure! Come on. Here he comes! Turn over, quick! Shut up. Hi, Felix! Hello, Isabelle. My friend, Milan. - How's it going? - Good, you? Hey... We're good. The beach, the sunshine... Party time! Tonight we're going out. Wanna come? Sure, okay. Cool! I'll call, we'll meet up. - If you like. - Great. See you tonight. Awesome, bye. Check it out. - Perfect. - Here you go. Twist the top. - Light me up. - Now? How do I look? Am I hot? You look like a whore. Really? Yeah. Look at me. Careful. That's better. Off I go. Distract them while I sneak out. Okay. You'll tell me everything? Promise. Not in bed yet? What are you doing? Nothing. - And your sister? - Sleeping, I think. Really? - Not seeing her German? - She's not into him. Does he speak French? Yeah. Fluently? Not bad for a German. Go get ready for bed. I stayed at the beach. With Milan, who you met. We bodysurfed. Do you bodysurf? Ice cream? Good evening, sir. Here you go. 6 euros. Have a nice evening. Thank you. Let's go to the beach. Want it? Is it good? Very good. First time? Yes. Don't be afraid. Thanks for tonight. Good night, Isabelle. You're not in bed? Obviously! Where were you? Does your mom know? No need to tell her! What are you doing here? Waiting for you. So? Done. - You slept with him? - Yes. How was it? I don't want to discuss it with you. Come on, you promised! Was it bad? Go to bed. Victor... Don't tell Mom. Right. Hello! It's handsome Felix! - Hello, ma'am. - Call me Sylvie. Patrick, this is Felix. Veronique, Peter... Felix. - Hey, Felix! - Hey, Victor. You good? - Can I sit with you? - If you like. - How about a swim? - Good idea. - Patrick, get up. - Coming. Victor, coming? Not yet. No jellyfish today? Isn't it cold? Your sister's weird. Why? Don't know. I never met a girl like her. Course not. You're German and she's French. Give me a hand. Shouldn't we wait for him? She didn't want him to come. Seventeen. Get the presents. Happy birthday to you We're off-key! Happy birthday, dear Isabelle Make a wish! Don't cry... That was Felix. - Autumn - 6th floor. Come in. Hello... Lea. Hello. I know, I lied about my age. Doesn't everyone? Do you mind? You don't look like the photos either. I know. Like a drink? Maybe a glass of water. Have a seat. You're very pretty. Prettier than the photos. Student? Yes. Times are hard. How old are you? Twenty. Beautiful eyes. Melancholy. You look very young. I know. People often say that. Can I see you again? - You have my number. - Do you do evenings? Just late afternoons. No weekends. Shame. Goodbye. - What'd you write? - "Bold." Dinner's in the fridge. Heat it in the microwave. See you tomorrow. Work on your grammar, Victor. Bye, Mouna. See you tomorrow. I'm wiped out. Learn to knock! What are you doing? - Scram, I'm working. - Watching porn? Get lost. I'll eat without you. No one's serious at seventeen On a beautiful night Beer, lemonade And glaring cafes you do not need You stroll down the promenade Lindens smell nice on June nights The air is so sweet You close your eyes The town is near The wind brings sounds And scents of vineyards and beer June nights Seventeen You let yourself go Sap makes you giddy like champagne You dream A kiss alights On your lips like a butterfly Your heart Crusoes adventurously In the pale halo of a streetlamp A young girl passes alluringly She finds you highly naive Her boot heels tapping She turns on a dime, eyes wide And on your lips Cavatinas die It's love Your sonnets amuse her Your friends flee You're too twee Then one night Your beloved writes And on that night You return to the glaring cafes You order beer or lemonade No one's serious at seventeen When lindens line the promenade Rimbaud explores the intoxication of nature and the excesses that lead to love when you're young and lose your inhibitions. When you're 17 you can have a summer romance then go back to school and tell everyone how you fell in love and what a great summer you had. His beloved makes him a man. It's about becoming an adult. It's about the euphoria of summer, being carefree, having freedom... happiness and joy. There's a neologism in the third stanza. A reference to Robinson Crusoe. You have an adventure but ultimately you're alone. It ends as it begins. Life is often symbolized by an unbroken circle, infinitely repeating itself. It's not just a poem about meeting someone. It's like a diagnosis of youthful dreams of love. Tomorrow, 5 pm. 300 euros. Where? - Coming to eat? - Be right there. A boyfriend? - How'd you know? - It shows. - From school? - No way. - How old? - 32. Wise choice. Screw these runts. What's he do? Works at a law firm. Cool. Remember the perv who hit on us after school? Yeah. It happened to my sister's friend and she went for it. Really? All that for a Prada handbag! What's her problem? We should've kept the perv's number. Seriously? Just kidding. I hate Prada handbags! I'm off. When will you be home? Late. I'm doing homework with Claire. Did you take my gray silk blouse? Are you sure? Obviously. You piss me off. Watch your tone! Study hard. How dare she? Leave it. Excuse me. Hello. Sit down. What's your name again? Lea. Excellent choice. How old are you? Twenty. You're a student? Literature, second year. Where? The Sorbonne. Something wrong? No, I'm fine. Rub your cunt. Be natural. Don't look at my cock! Turn over, show me your ass. On all fours. Here. Can I take a shower? What? My money. Coming. It's 300. You're not worth it. We agreed on 300. Scram or I'll tell your parents you're a whore. I'm free now 500 euros I want my money first. For 500 I want a bareback blowjob. I don't know. Don't worry, I'm married. Full-time business? No, just occasional. Know what they say? Once a whore, always a whore. Where shall I drop you? Subway's fine. Did you know Isabelle's home? No, I didn't hear her. She's taking a shower again. It's a female thing. Working? I have an essay due. - You've got all day Sunday. - I'll do that. Remember the theatre tonight. Couldn't you take Victor? He's staying at a friend's. We'd like you to come. What a bore. You need to get out sometimes. When I was your age... I know, you were a party animal, blah blah blah. Make an effort. We're dining with Peter and Vero after. Hi there! It's about to start. - Where are you? - We're... In the balcony. See you at intermission. Where are they? Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. Did you see your mother? It's about to start. Pardon, excuse me. What a long queue! Wednesday, same time, room 6095, G. 6th floor. You like theatre? Not really. Were they your parents? Yes. He's my stepfather. Your mother is a beautiful woman, too. She has no idea? Good thing. You lied about your age. Are you legal at least? Obviously. I turned 18 last summer. Thank you. Do you see many others? Anybody home? Mom says you got a girlfriend. Right! You can tell your big sister. Did you write to your German? Don't want to see him? Why bother? He lives far away. And he meant nothing. You liked him? Yeah, he was nice. Nice isn't enough. Tell me about your girlfriend. Or boyfriend. As if! I'm like you, I'm not in love. How do you know? Do you jack off? Cut it out! You're such a pervert. - Shocked? - Shut up. Do you use internet porn? Let me watch TV. Wait. You don't want to? Are you married? Yes. The woman at the theatre? That was my daughter. I wasn't a good father. I didn't pay much attention to her. She was angry with me for a long time. It's better now. We're closer. We see plays, movies. She enjoys it and so do I. Are you a good husband? I try to be. How about you? What? Your father. My father is my father. You can undress now. Georges? Fuck! How'd you do it? I told you, I slipped in the shower. No wonder. You take so many showers. I'm putting on some gauze. You'll have a scab. Will it last long? The time it takes to heal. A beautiful bandage! Like when you were little, always bleeding. Such a tomboy. - Winter - Excuse me... - We're looking for Mrs. Bontale. - Have an appointment? Police. My daughter Isabelle? Isabelle... Or Lea. Lea? That's my mother's name. I don't understand. Is this your daughter? Yes, I believe so. Georges Ferriere often saw your daughter Lea. She's leading a double life. As a prostitute. She's 17, you're mistaken. It's definitely her. As a minor, she's just a witness. She's legally considered a victim. But we will investigate to see if she's acting on her own free will or with a pimp. Children can access internet porn. They get ideas. Unless you use parental controls. Ever check her phone messages? Did you know about this? Did you know? - Coming to Ben's party? - Don't know. His parents are gone, it's gonna be good. Yeah, maybe. Etienne will be there. Good time for me to make a move. You can bring your guy. That's over. Shit... Are you sad? It's for the best. Too much age difference. Leaving already? Your mother's home. What's up? It's not my business. What's with her? Don't know. See you tomorrow. Home already? Your sister and I need to talk. Come here, please. I know everything. About Lea. Stay put. The police came. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? Tell me what? What you're doing! Whoring! Whoring? Think it's funny? That man died, do you realize? Do you realize? You sicken me! Do you know how bad you've hurt me? Do you know? What's wrong with you? Have you gone crazy? Why'd you do it? You've broken my heart! Isabelle... Please. Forgive me. I'm sorry. What happened? My baby! My little girl... Why? Did you use condoms at least? Yes. You swear you've quit? Yes. Bring the potatoes, Victor. Dinnertime, everyone. I've got good news. What? About winter vacation. You got it? Yep, the chalet's free. We're going skiing? You can retake the snowflake test! - I ski better than you. - We'll see about that. Will you come with us? Of course, why do you ask? What did I do wrong? Stop feeling guilty. But why? It's pointless. How could I miss the signs? Your daughter's such a pretty girl. What do you mean? It's no surprise she got offers. - Are you kidding? - What? She's pretty, so she's a whore? That's not what I said. Don't talk shit. What did she tell you? Nothing. No explanation. The police say she needs time to comprehend her actions. At least she quit when that man died. What if he hadn't died? She'd have continued, imagine! She needs more authority. Maybe she should go to her dad's. We have enough trouble as it is. She'll give her statement tomorrow. You'll find a shrink and go from there. No point being so dramatic. "Being so dramatic"? Do you realize what she's done? Of course I do. Give her some limits, punish her. She's grounded. No computer, no phone. Does your son know? I suppose so. He saw the police and heard me talking to Mouna. I'll talk to him tomorrow. Good. Think I'm in the mood? I just want to hold you. I'm sorry. A man followed me after school. - He offered me money. - Did you accept? He gave me his number in case I changed my mind. 0623214637. When did you call him? A week later. Where did you meet? Hotel Intercontinental at Opera. Did you like it? Not at first. I was disgusted, but wanted to try again. How did you try again? I saw a thing on TV about students needing money. I got money in exchange for "favors"... I bought a second phone and got started. Plan to continue? I don't know. It was an experience. A dangerous one. Johns can be violent. No one protects you. Minors are easy prey. Prostitutes are frequently attacked, raped, even murdered. Easy money is a downward spiral. Let's talk about Mr. Georges Ferriere. Were you aware of anything? His heart trouble? He was old, he took pills. What pills? I don't know. Viagra. Did you practice S&M? Risky erotic games? Strangulation, handcuffs, brutality? No, it was normal. Why did you run away? I didn't know what to do. How long did you stay after he died? I don't know, I was in shock. He was dead. You're sure he was dead? Yes. Had you ever seen a dead person? My grandfather, but that was different. Did you take money? What we'd agreed upon. Are you keeping my money? You're a minor, your mother will. Finish your yogurt? Go get ready for bed. I'll leave you two alone. Stay, it's important. So... I asked at the hospital. They recommended someone very good. I'm not sick. But you need to talk to someone. I don't want to talk. After what happened, therapy is mandatory. You can't force me. What do you prefer? Therapy, or a mental institution? It's for your own good. It can't hurt to try. What about my money? I thought we might donate it to a charity. Like one that helps prostitutes. Great idea. Assholes! It was a shock, I didn't understand. I still don't. She's always had whatever she wanted. I make a good living, I've always spoiled her. I give her money. She can buy anything she wants. Did you need money? Then why get paid? To know your worth? It was simpler, clearer. How can you say that? Let her speak. Were they older men? Obviously. Your father's age? Or yours. Tell me about him. Nothing to say. I can tell you we separated seven years ago. He lives in Italy. He remarried and has a new baby. The kids see him on school breaks. Do you get along? Sure, he's my father. Do you miss him? You have a right to be angry or sad. Do you get child support? Of course. Everything's fine between us. Does he give you money? Yes, for my birthday and Christmas. - Enough? - Yes. How much? 500 at Christmas. And for my birthday. This year he forgot. No, he sent me a check. You didn't tell me. Now, Isabelle, let's decide when to meet. Are you willing to come once a week? How much is it? 70 euros. Is that all? That's my rate. I could pay with the money from turning tricks. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't know, is it? Isabelle's right. It's her money. She earned it. - Hi, Isabelle. - Hi, Peter. Hi, kids. Hi, Lucie. So? She seems fine, same as usual. What's she wearing? Hi, Isabelle. How are you, Vero? Tired, with Sophie teething. But good. A bottle if she wakes up? Yes, it's all in the kitchen. Bye, Mom. Just heat it. She'll probably sleep. Wanna see my drawings? Don't pester Isabelle. I want you in bed soon. Help yourself if you're hungry. Good luck. We won't be late. Have fun. Password Hello. I fell asleep. How'd it go? Fine. Did Sophie wake up? No, she's sleeping soundly. You came at 7:30. That's six hours, right? Got money, Peter? I only have 50. How much? 10 euros. Thanks. Shall we, Isabelle? Peter, wait. What? I'll take her home. - Are you sure? - Yes. Why didn't you want Peter to take me? I told you, he's up early. You don't trust me? Of course I do. Then you don't trust him. What are you on about? I know Mom told you everything. I'm not the dangerous one. Meaning what? Hi. Hi! How's it going? I made 60 euros. What? Babysitting. Very funny. What are you watching? Nothing much, just crap. Waiting up for me? Is Mom in bed? Yes, she's exhausted. It's tough right now. Why? Don't play innocent, you know why. What's with you? You make me laugh. I make you laugh? You remind me of a guy I slept with. A john. - What's this game, Isabelle? - No game. Go easy on your mother, she's fragile. Talk to her, help her understand. It's hard for a mother. It's my business, my life. Make an effort, be nice. She's very upset. Are you? Yes, I'm upset, too. Doesn't matter, I'm not your dad. So what do you think? I think you're a teenager experimenting, testing her limits, transgressing. Ever slept with a whore? None of your business. Come on, tell me! I won't tell Mom. What's going on? We're just talking. Go to bed right now. Sorry, she... I know, be quiet. How about boarding school? I don't know. She's bad to the bone. What are you talking about? I saw how she looked at you. Relax, she's just being provocative. My own daughter disgusts me. You two need to have a long talk. Where are you going? What are you doing here? It's late. I've got an idea. What? How about a mother-daughter shopping weekend in London? Peter's parents could loan us their studio. We could see a musical. I hate musicals. What have we done to make you this way? I don't understand. We used to be close. We talked. - Is it because of Patrick? - Course not. - What's the shrink say? - Dumb stuff. Such as? None of your business. I was your age once, I was wild, too. Yeah? Were you a whore, too? I'm your mother. It's normal for me to worry and try to fix things. I know about you and Peter. What do you mean? Are you sleeping together? If I said yes, what would that change? I'd know you trust me. You scare me, Isabelle. I liked making the appointments. Chatting on the Internet. Talking on the phone. Hearing their voices. Imagining things. Then going. Checking out the hotel. Wondering what he'd be like. It was like a game. A game that's dangerous. Well, a little. I didn't feel much during it. But when I thought about it at home or at school, I wanted to do it again. With someone else. Until that man died? Yes. Georges. You saw him several times, this Georges? Yes. Why? He was nice. It was sweeter with him. He didn't want much, he'd just caress me, look at me. Except the last time. He asked me to get on him. And he died. After that, I didn't want to any more. I felt dirty. Dirty? Why? For killing him. What's up? I did it with Etienne. That's good news, isn't it? I was awful. He's avoiding me. Acting like nothing happened. Why, was it bad? It lasted three minutes. I felt nothing, I didn't know he came. It's no big deal. You've done it, you got it over with. Don't cry. The first time is always like that. How do you know? You're still a virgin. You slept with your lawyer? No, but... I've read a lot about it. It's always the same. So, will Etienne be at Ben's party? Yes. I'll come with you. Thanks. It's okay. Mom's cool with it? Yeah, she talked to my shrink. - Who'll be there? - Classmates. Do I look ugly? No, you're okay. No make-up? Should I? A little, yeah. Know what this girl in my class does? What? French kisses for 5 euros. That's cheap. Did you buy one? Hell no, I don't have to pay. No shame in it. Good way to learn. Know my friend Marco? I think so. He wants to do it with a girl. Forget it, he can't afford it. Didn't you stop? Yeah, I'm kidding. I'll get it. Don't say anything. Hi! Ready? Hi, ma'am. - How are you? - Good, you? Don't be late. Call if you need to. I will. - Have fun. - Bye. Have fun, girls! It'll be fine. You need to trust her. Hi! Having fun? - Yeah, you? - Yeah. Where you headed? Just around. Hi, Isabelle. Hi. - Too hot for you, too? - I just need air. Me, too. I think I drank too much. We never see you. Claire insisted. I'm glad. Want a smoke? Sure, thanks. What if I said I wanted to kiss you? Sorry, I'm a jerk. Okay, kiss me. You sure? Yes. What are you doing? Come on! Want to come home with me? Not the first night. - Spring - Brunch is ready! Shit! Are they coming? Yeah, we might as well start. It's the first day of spring. Sure is. Sorry, I don't know what's wrong. What are you doing? Just leave it to me. Morning. Have a seat, Alex. - Where's Isabelle? - In the shower. Did you shower? Not yet. - Can you tell? - I can smell! Coffee, right? Thanks. How was the concert? Awesome. Great band. We left before the party. Why? Isabelle wanted to. Not my fault. I know. She works too hard. Isabelle, coming? We saved you a croissant. Where'll we go this summer? We can't seem to agree. I want to go back down south. For two weeks, at least. What are you reading? Leave me alone. What's wrong? I just want to read in peace. Don't wanna go out? Later. Are you mad at me? It's over, Alex. What's over? Us. Why do you say that? I'm not in love with you. Why, what'd I do? Nothing. It's me. I can't help it. We're good together. Aren't we? Yes. Then what? Give us some time. What are you up to? Nothing. Wanna play video games? Go ahead. Where's Alex? He left. Why didn't he say goodbye? Don't know. He seemed sad. What'd he say? Nothing. He didn't want to play. Did you tell him? Maybe he suspects. No, that's not it. Hello, miss. Hello, miss. What can I get for you? - I'm waiting for someone. - Very well. Hello. May I sit down? Yes. What are you having? Same as you. - Are you sure? - Yes. Excuse me. Two whiskies, please. I found your number in his address book. Lea. That was my pseudonym. I know. I wanted to see you. The last girl my husband saw before he died. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. He was ill. Dying while making love is a beautiful death, no? You're young. And very beautiful. Thank you. Too beautiful. I imagined you differently. I imagined you differently, too. Really? Did he talk about me? No, never. How old are you really? 17. 17... Lovely age. I was 17 when I met Georges. I knew he saw other women. At first it hurts... In the end it suited me. I've always been melancholy. If I'd been brave, less shy... I'd have liked men to pay me to make love. But I never dared. Sometimes I fantasized about it. Now I'm too old. I'm the one who'd have to pay. It happened in Room 6095, right? Yes. I reserved it. I want you to come with me. 300 euros? That was your price? So it was here? Yes. I needed to see this room. We loved each other to the end. Such tenderness between us... Want to talk or do I undress? No need. Sorry. Come lay down by my side. I needed to see this room, too. Thank you.
