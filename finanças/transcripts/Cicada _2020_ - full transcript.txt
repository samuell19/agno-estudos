Originally McQueary claimed to have witnessed Sandusky fondling a 10-year-old boy in an on campus locker room March, 2002, but prosecutors now claim the abuse took place in February 2001.

I don't even know why I went to the bar, I don't like gay bars, but a few hours go by, and I'm drunk, and tired of white dudes ignoring me, so I go home. When I'm at the station I see this dude, this beautiful Latino dude. He notices me, and I wink, and he smiles, and I walk over to him, and I give him my number. When he leans in he kisses me right there. This is before I met you. Now in the corner of my eye I can see this old white lady frowning, and so I pull him closer, and we make out hard right there until my train comes. [laughs] I was geek the whole way home. You know I never do stuff like that. And I'm walking back, and this silver car pulls up, and he lays down, rolls down his window, and he, he says, "Where's the party at?" At first I thought he was trying to hit on me, you know like I was gonna quip with something funny, and feeling myself after that kiss, you know. And um, he shot me, he shot me, and I'm just laying there, and he drives off. And I'm thinking, God, please don't let me go out like this, like this is the most cliche boys in the hood way to go out, and I'm thinking about the bar, and the station, and kissing that dude, and I just wish none of that shit ever happened, you know. The craziest part is I actually thought he was trying to hit on me, like he wanted me, somebody wanted me. [insects chirping] [wind blowing] [birds chirping] [ball bouncing] You should tell your dad.

No. I went to an episcopal church though growing up. Yeah, Bible camp. Huh, that's a great kind of camp. Yeah. For a talent show this one year "Who Let the Dogs Out" was pretty big.

No one talks about that, Sam. Come on, Dad. People ask questions what's taking so long. Principal didn't believe those kids. Took a half dozen for them to even question Jerry. Half these kids' fathers didn't believe them. Can you believe that, Sam? [woman singing in foreign language] Have you ever talked to someone? [Ben] What do you mean? Like a therapist? [Sam] Uh, yeah.

Here we are last spring with one of the victims. [Victim] I was, I was just really scared, uh, and I came home after school one day, and I just, I just told her. Uh, I didn't know what to do. [Mom] I always knew something was wrong, and then I asked him, I asked him. I mean I, I had no idea. He was like a father figure to my son. He was basically a father, and he ruined my whole family. He's ruined us. [Ben] [crying] All those kids, Sam. - Those kids. - It's okay. [Ben] You think he's gone, but. [Sam] I got you, I got you, I got you. Okay, let's go back to um, what you were saying earlier. Uh, people automatically judge when they hear you've been abused. They think, oh, this kid is damaged, this kid is a liar, this kid um, is probably going to abuse someone themselves. But this just isn't the case. We are finding out that pedophiles have it innately, like an orientation, and that children who have been molested are just more likely to fuck up our relationship. [chuckles] You know what? First off fuck child molesters. Fuck 'em, skull fuck 'em to death. They acted, let them burn. You know when you get passed all of the hate and the anger, you realize that this is a person who is confused. This person was a kid once too, and, and, and they need help. And the more that we help them get help we help children, right? Right, right? So I think that it would be cathartic for you to um, learn a bit. Um, listen to this. It is a really beautiful piece. This teenager's talking about when she discovered that she was attracted to children. It's really fascinating, it's on NPR. We'll talk about it next week. [feet tapping] Klonopin. Okay, well, that is all the time we have this week. Um, you really talked my ear off. I am not gonna be town for our next session, but for the time being I would like you to practice being more open, Ben. Talk to your friends, talk to strangers, just tell the world your story. [Meteorologist] 94 today in Central Park. 94 or 5 out at Newark International, but that front's gonna come through tomorrow night. And over the weekend it looks perfect. - Couple of showers- - I was molested. [Meteorologist] Upstate New York otherwise uh, it's just gonna be dry, and cool, and crisp. Cleveland 62, Buffalo 61 on Saturday. [upbeat music] Yeah, my ex was molested. She always played the victim, every argument. She was one the worst people I ever knew. I don't wanna ugly cry, no one's even here to see. I love you, you know that? [Ben] I love you. Why don't we go to Dave & Buster's - do all the big kid stuff? - Yeah. Okay, cool, we'll tell everyone you got molested, - we'll get free drinks. - Yeah.

I used to think about him every day, then it was every other day. Then I'd wake up drenched in sweat and not know why. Growing up I'd clean things until my hands were raw. I brushed my teeth until they bled. The only thing that made me feel good was joke. What's the difference between anal and oral? [Sam] What? Oral makes your day, anal makes your whole week. [Sam laughing] [seagulls squawking] I had become such a clown when I finally tried to tell someone they laughed. It was 13 years inside of me. I always thought if I ended up with a man it would mean I lost. Hey, you think this shirt's too small? I should of worn the black one. You look beautiful. [Sam] Oh, thanks. - Hey, sweetie. - Hi. This is Sam. - Hi, Sam. - Hey, how's it going? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. [Debbie laughs] I didn't get the, the memo. [Sam] Ah, yeah, good style. What? Oh, the shirts. [laughs] You're so handsome, my goodness. Ben doesn't tell me tell you anything. Hun, your new son is handsome. [Sam laughs] [birds chirping] I'm sure he loves you very much. He must be proud. Yeah. Well, I wanna tell him. Sometimes a parent knows, Sam, and they're waiting. You know they, they love their children so much but they hate to see them suffer, and they're truly afraid of pushing them away. If he really thinks in his heart that you're wrong it's moments that like this that'll make him rethink what's right. I don't have the answers for you, hun, but I'm so glad you and Benny have each other. - Bye, Sam. - It was meeting you. So nice to meet you. - Bye. - Buh-bye, Ben. - Bye. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you too. [Ben retching] Oh, sorry for the mix up, Ben. I had a morning. Spilled all the soup into a Coinstar. It doesn't want that. But uh, you know like that magic coin machine, Ben, we need to give our bodies what they want. I'm still having problems like swallowing. And sometimes when I run it's like uh, I lose the connection with my body. Oh, I see. Like my toe, it's still numb. Like it feels dead. Yeah, that's all in the chart, bad throat, dead toe. [gentle brooding music] You got enough EpiPens? [birds chirping] It's gonna be great. I'm excited. So the, how many are gonna be there? Six. Six, hmm. And uh, these are like your closest friends? Yep. And they're like around our age? Look you don't have to go if you don't wanna go. Of course I wanna go, of course I wanna go. Okay, this means a lot to me. [motorcycle engine roaring] [motorcycle engine bangs] Jesus. Whoo, that scared me. Whoa. Sam, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You okay, babe? Don't touch me. - Babe, babe. - Please. [gentle brooding music] [fireworks popping] God. God, if I don't take a dump on someone's chest by the end of the night I don't know what I am worth. I can't right now. Okay, give me a minute. [Theresa] Where's Sam? At home? He's at work. You two want a little second agenda. Little yellow legal pad and some penmanship if you know what I mean. I got a, I got a bulletin board with dart. [Theresa whooshes] [Theresa grunts] Theresa, I'm really not in the mood today. Oh. I hope everything works out. [train engine whirring] [waves crashing] Tell mommy what's going on? Come on. Benny. Ben. Ben. [phone ringing] [birds chirping] [Ben] Hello. Yeah, this is Ben. [traffic humming] Hey, Doc. - Ben, hey. - Hey, hey. So good phone call today, huh? - I texted you. - Yeah. You talked to Celia, right? - Yeah. - Great. Let's go back in though, let's go back in. No, no need, we did all the tests, nothing came up. You're good. [Ben] Yeah, but, Doc, you know I still have nausea, okay. - I still get the headaches. - I understand, - but you talked to Celia. - This doesn't come - out of nowhere though. - You talked to Celia. This doesn't come out of nowhere. Doc, I had, I had red marks on my arms you saw that, I couldn't invent that. I'm not saying you did, Ben. I'm just saying that you're fine. You should enjoy that news. Okay. All right, Monday, Monday, you go home now I understand but Monday I'll come back in okay, and we can just talk, and we get to the bottom of it, okay? Have you talked to your mother about this? I can't tell you why you're feeling the way you feel, I'm just a doctor. [knuckles tapping] [door creaking] - Hey. - Hey, how ya doing? [Sam] What's happening, old man? Middle of the week, this is a surprise. All right. [Sam] Can I sit down for a second? Sure, come on. You all right? [door creaking] [door bangs] [insects chirping] [Girl yells] [train engine humming] [Girl giggling] [insects chirping] [train horn honking] [Debbie] I put in extra Tang. Tang doesn't go in Long Island iced tea, Ma. [Debbie] It goes in mine. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mmm, delicious. Long Island ice teas for astronauts. It's crazy how everything's grown in, huh, Benny. Little paradise. You forget there was even a tree over there. Look. You wouldn't have remembered unless I told you. Thanks for coming out and visiting your old momma. She loves seeing her boy. You hear them? We haven't had a brood like this since. '96. Your dad didn't have his hernia. I had a beautiful perm. Cat was, uh '94, very good memory. You know they say this batch is special. I watched a "TED Talk". They only come out every 17 years, so see, yeah, you're right, '96. Some think it's a survival mechanism. The prime numbers prevent their predators from knowing their patterns. They live underground all their lives and then one day they all come out, climb up the big trees, spread their wings, and play us their little songs, and we listen. I just want you to know that I love you and Sam so much, Benny. You make me very happy. I love you too, Ma. Hey, how about you and your momma go to the beach tomorrow like the old days, huh? We'll go to Robert Moses, I'll buy you a snow cone. I'll let you pee in the water. [Ben] It's a date. It's a date? It's a date. Hey, Ma. Yeah, Benny? [Ben whimpering] What is it, Ben? [wind blowing] I gotta tell you something. [waves crashing] [gentle music]
