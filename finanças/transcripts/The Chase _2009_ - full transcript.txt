You can see a woman and a man. The window is half open and it's pouring outside. Their moan is buried within the walls by the sound of the heavy rain. only can be heard in the room. Aroma candles are lit on the bed table... dyeing their bodies in red. Did it hurt? You can do better. asshole. We're not done yet. Come in. Sit over there. I'm glad we left early. They don't know when to call it a night. I should go home. No. You're not hungry. are you? What a nice place. And it has two stories. Let's go upstairs. Come on. I'm really sick. They wiggle like a lizard tail that's been cut off. And they're engraved with fresh blood. He wants to be inspired. And she does magic for him. You will write better with this. Can you be with me? It's weekend. Is it? I hate you sighing. What's the matter? Dead. Who? A plant I liked. You're so silly. It's still there. I'm thirsty. Don't worry about liver cancer. You hardly drink. I mean it. My doctor said... "My doctor said I should carry a plant." How'd you know? Come on. I can't believe you fell for that. You don't get it. My liver is so fatty... On a second thought. I can see why. You still have to drink with me. I really shouldn't. Cheers. It's not vodka. Keep going with the story. And then what? They're in the car. Going somewhere... And the road is beautifully fogged up. Your sigh must've turned into a fog. Should I cook this fog for us? Put your hair in it. too. Must be nice! It tickles. Come here. Stop it. I'm driving. I'll take one thing off for each glass you empty. I won't make you drink for nothing. They indulge each other just as their first time... like two cannibal plants tangled up. He wants her more than ever. wondering how deep he can go inside her. He wants to conquer her entirely because he knows their time is running out. Does she know that. too? She senses it soon. The two halves becoming one. like two cannibal plants. intertwined to feed on each other. They're ready to devour each other's souls. And something happens... that he expected and that she didn't. Was it a warning for their corrupt souls? Or was it God's help to save him from dying in the pain of art? Or did God give her a chance to get something... that she doesn't deserve? Jane... Don't talk. Then what? That's the end? No. it's the beginning. Remember me? My daughter tutored you in high school. I even cooked for you. How dare you show up here! Stop it. You're nothing but a whore. Get out of here! You didn't have to go alone like this. She's crazy! You think so? It's hot. isn't it? Should I continue? Jung-ha... She keeps on living her life. as if nothing happened. I'll send you the design guidelines again. Yes. I'm okay. When's the deadline? Sure. it's no problem. Okay. Honey? Get up. Breakfast is ready. Let me sleep some more. Come on. Let's eat together. You know we can't. Why not? You know...I'm dead. So cruel. Why'd you write something like that? I don't know. Why do people drink? It's so bitter. And why are you getting undressed? I don't know. She planned to start a new life with him in Spain. But her plan is now off. She doesn't know what to do. Whether to hate or miss him... Whether to remember or forget him... Neither does Naru. She just wants to run away. I'm sorry. I won't be working for a while. No. Don't worry. I'm okay. I'll call you back later. One day. she receives a card. But she couldn't care less. She receives another one. And it's trashed again. "Water it and what you need will grow." It's a plant. And out of the card... something really necessary does grow. Why are you here? How'd you get in? I've been here for a while. Get out of here. Now! No point kicking me out. Cause I'll be back again. What's going on here? Did you call her in? Get out. Now. No. Get out. Please. Let me stay here. I'll do anything. Shut up and leave. I'm begging you. Let me stay. You can curse. beat me and do all you want. Just let me stay here. Please. No way. Why don't you? You've got things to solve with her. I said no! Jung-ha. please. Let her stay or I'll leave. Naru promises to be her slave. And Jung-ha decides to take her anger out on her. Cut that part out. Should I? What about the guy? Jung-ha keeps calling him. That's the truth about him she doesn't know of? You can say that. I don't know. Maybe it's like a SOS sign. I can't do this at all. God... Jung-ha lets Naru stay but can't accept her. Jung-ha thought she'd end up exhausted and leaving... or she's too disheartened to deal with her. Hi. You still can't get over him? Searching for his memories... it's not like that. Save it. That's what you're here for. isn't it? I won't touch his things if it bothers you. You sure? Change into that. It'll bring back vivid memories of him. Wanna see me in pain? Give it up. You'll only find yourself in pain. You haven't eaten for days. Try it. You liked it back then. I don't know if you still do. You cooked for him. too? What? You loved him. He would only eat what I cooked. He's gone. and you wanna cook for me instead? Jung-ha... Come on. stop it. Are you ok? I will live. This will serve as evidence that you did drink. Here. You want to see me suffering? Are you? Really? How bad? Very. Very bad. You're killing me. Make it tighter. How do I look? Pretty. Jung-ha is in so much pain... to the point where she can't feel it anymore. Naru just wants to share the her pain. You're still so pretty. What did you do after high school? A lot of things. I delivered. I cleaned. I gave manicures. Then I acted in a few plays. I did magic. too. You know what you're best at. Like what? Recognize this? You could've been a porn star. You were a slut back in school days. I wasn't. You knew that. I thought I did. Eat it. Eat it all. So you can cherish such a precious memory. It's some sight to see. One day she finds another truth about Jane. I'm just curious. "Medical certificate: Hepatoma" We gave his organs to 3 patients. The surgeries went well. No side effects or complications have been reported. Anyway. thanks again for such a decision. Okay. I found a medical certificate in the room. But I'm not sure what it means. Was anything wrong with his liver? You didn't know? He mustn't have told you. He had a liver problem. I'd advised him to carry a plant for 5 years... so he would stop drinking. But I guess it wasn't too easy. His liver wasn't good for a transplant. Oh. you're up early. I'm sorry. I can wash my hair. Just leave. I want to. Does it feel good? Touching someone's skin... It's like going through all the memories... in the cells. While doing it... if I run into a painful memory... I console it. Then the pain heals and you feel better. These touches. The order. Directions. Pressure. So familiar. Is it? Even the water temperature. Did you wash his hair every time like this? Now you're showing me how you did it? I bet it was more than that. You must've started off the same way. But the tub must've been full of blood. Like two brutes... Jung-ha... Get your hands off! It creeps me out. Don't touch me. Get out. Out! When did it begin? Seeing each other behind my back... Did you wanna ruin me? Was that it? No...No... Haven't you caused me enough pain? Why can't you stop? Why? Jung-ha... Why? Tell me why. Tell me. asshole! Naru thought it was a good sign. Coz she was scared of Jung-ha who never showed anger. Why didn't she show anger? She didn't want to give Naru what she wanted. She didn't wanna lose. Let's drink more. I'll get new glasses. No matter how far she fell... she got right back up on her feet. She considered herself fortunate enough... and didn't get upset about anything. What about him? Why'd he cheat on her? He couldn't breathe. Cause she was perfect? No. Cause his life was in a rut. Like a river that's stopped running. Soon he couldn't write. Then Naru came to him. As if she was meant to. But he loathed her. When she stared at him... he felt insulted to his core. Then why? But the short time that he had her he could not give that up. even if that meant he will die in hell. Whenever they had sex like animals... words wrote themselves for him. Are you okay? I'm fine. Come on in. Hi. She's just a maid. Don't mind her. Draw the tub for us. Come. Let's go. Stop it. You're damn hot. Wait. hey! Come up here. You're gonna bring her? Oh. Really? It's okay. Tie me. Are you for real? Tie me up. What are you doing? Tie me like he tied you. Tighter. Come on. Tighter. Come on. Are you sure you want... Tighter! Tighter! Come on! You can do better! Tie me tighter. Make it much tighter. Where are you going? Get back here! It's no fun. Oh God... Why are you making me like this? What's that? For a month. I was at the hospital... I couldn't sleep at all. These are sedative pills. I've saved secretly every day. And I carry them on me. In case I couldn't stand this punishment. Jung-ha... Who says you can die? One day... they are on the road where he was on. It feels weird. Why? A wife and a lover celebrating his birthday together. What a lucky bastard. Without the accident. we would be in Barcelona now. It happened only a week before we were to leave. I had been accepted to a school there. We were so excited to move. I didn't know. No? Looking back. it was just me who was excited. He was so sad. He threw away the plant he had cherished. and wept himself out behind my back. I didn't wanna stop him because he needed you. It was unfair. You inspired him. Why couldn't I? You knew about us? I even suspected he caused the accident. Because he wasted 5 years with nothing to show for. Cause he was indecisive. Leave now. What? Leave. Stop saying that. I'd rather kill myself. I mean it. Do you know what I hated most? It was your forelock. It covers your forehead and eyebrows. It started raining that day unexpectedly. All my dad did was magic. So I didn't expect him to pick me up. You stole me an umbrella from a store. I said I didn't want it. And you said that you didn't steal it but just let the store owner do a good thing... so he wouldn't go to hell for being that bad. Right then. a raindrop... It fell on your forehead like God's voice. And it exploded over your eyebrows. So did my heart. If I could get near you... I would've done worse than seducing him. I just wanted to be with you. That's enough. He might hear you. Don't make him upset on his birthday. Let's go. When we first kissed... Stop it. I don't remember. My tongue... When it got into your mouth... You told me you heard a bell ringing. Was it the same when you kissed Jane? Yes. You truly loved him. Hit me. Hit me. Not enough. Hit me harder. Hit me much harder! Come here. Come here! Naru did the greatest magic of all times... that killed her father in the water container. For her own redemption. Jung-ha felt sorry for her late husband. No matter how hard he tried... he wouldn't have gotten anything... out of a woman who didn't love him. Stop. I said stop. Am I not better than your husband? What a nerve! You're not there. yet. Stop it. will you? Can't you still see? I'm you. Jung-ha. Push me. Are you sure? You sure? Yes. push me Hit me. Awake? You can leave now. Thanks. I have to ask you. Yes? Did you know? Naru didn't... I know. I see. One day. Jane appeared in my dream and told me to understand. Again? Then again. I always had to understand. I can handle myself this time. too. Jung-ha thought to herself... Come on. stop it. Are you ok? I will live. This will serve as evidence that you did drink. Would you let me in?
