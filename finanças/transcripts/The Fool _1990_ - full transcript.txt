Yea all who it inherit shall dissolve, and like thisinsubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made of, and our little life is rounded with a sleep. [music playing] [applause] Oh, [inaudible] do take your time. Oh, I'll have you out of herein no time, Miss [inaudible]. Of course, I quite agree. But how do you know? Well, of course one knows. Of course one knows whenone's gentleman's hands are filled with the evening paper. And the evening paper is filled with the name of the scoundrel. And the greatest rogue that ever was. But her! Of course she was at the bottom of it all. So they've found out thedreadful Mr. Wesley at last. I don't see what youmean by at last, Georgie. You sound as if he knew he was a-- Fraud? Of course he was a fraud. He danced too well. He talked too much. [laughter] Georgie-- [inaudible] Tell us more about Mr. Wesley,dear Lady Wallanger, by all means. Scandals are myweakness, especially when they're about large fortune-- [interposing voices] She's always wrong. The Wesleys will not bedining at Lansdowne House on Wednesday, because I myself have planned a dinner on Wednesday. I'm sitting next to him. And, no, they won't be dining anywhere, because he's to be arrested. Ah. Well, it does seem that thewhole damn thing is over. Now, Lord Paramount, I'm very curious, but I happened to hear froma distant cousin of mine the other day who assures me that he could distinctly remember Wesley when he was a waiter at Brooks'. Nothing is really known or can be known. No, no. He certainly hasn't been inthe city all day yesterday. He should have been in the city. People will whisper forgery behind a man's back who wouldn't darethink it before his face. He should have been in the city. - Forgery! Forgery? That's not the worst of it. There isn't any money. Oh, this is awful. Oh, it could have been worse. Quite a few people have pulled out by now. Still. At a time like this, heshould have been in the city. Wesley's got plenty of money. My father still holds considerable amounts of his stock. There must be some money.Of course there is. - She had plenty.- Yes, they say that her-- I thought her father wasa cotton lord or something. They always have loads. Well, her father wasn't a cotton lord. Or she wasn't his daughter. Or she wasn't to have any of the cotton money. But there were hotels in Paris and shipping interests in the Mediterranean. Maybe some leaky old boat in Naples. There were no ships. I don't need to tell youhow I feel on the subject. The hotels were mortgaged over and over. Too much self-confidence. Too much reckless spending. Too much reckless lending. Not sound. Sir John and I have beenthinking so for a long time. It was to be expected. What a really, really dreadful man. But how the deuce is one supposed to know when a man is not sound? And what will be left of theprivileges of the privileged? My dear Beauchamp-Harper. I'll send him. Now, where is this man? Where is he? What's his name, you know, the one-- the one that they all hate so much? I can't remember his name. But I can't remember anybody's name. Well, uh, you, dear. What is your name? Give me your name. Oh, Mr. Wesley of a mind. I did so want to see his facenow that he's been found out. There's nothing more amusingthan the face of someone who's been found out. Except, of course, for the facesof those people who have been-- It is a perfectly sound-- --taken in by him. When they find out! There must be plenty of them here. Uh? Have you been taken in? And you? I say you. Have, uh, have you been taken in? Have you? Have you? Oh, yes, I'm sure you've been led by the nose. You too? Oh, it's very amusing. It puts me in mind of the South Sea bubble. That was in my youth. Everyone was taken in. 482 members of parliament. 161 peers. Everyone. But that's a very long time ago. They're all dead. There were others, too, all dead. There was a very amusing songwritten about the Greek loans. [singing] It was old when the bubble burst. Twas sweet to mark how cash andcan't did roil or turn at bark. Then it went fi dem di dem di dem [inaudible] fall, the spirit shocks. Were that all but all. The price of stocks. The price of stocks. The price-- hoo. The price of stocks. [inaudible] Oh, no, [inaudible] [knocking] Mr. Frederick? Has anybody seen Mr. Frederick? [knocking] Where is Mr. Frederick? There's too much talking, and not enough getting on with the work. Billy? Billy, where are you? Billy? Billy, where are you? Where the devil have you been? It's so dark. Where's a clip, Billy? Where have you been? I've been out. You've been with with Halton. I've been out on business for you, Billy. Mr. Frederick! What's he hollering about? Shh. I know you've been with Halton, you prig. I haven't, Billy. There was this man down by thearches in an old prison van. They call him Larry. Gives you a ninepence for akingsman if it's a black one. I know all about them parts,and I don't know of no Larry underneath the arches. Well, I tell ya. And I've got some of them. Give them to the old boy. Mr. Frederick. Uh, but I'm-- I'm-- only a check clerk. But let there be no mistakeabout what I am buying, what Sir John is buying. When I pay for a dog at the market price, I buy him out and out. When I pay for a clerk, [inaudible]. MAN: The grave trap, I said. [whistling] What's up with the old blinker tonight? I don't know. Shouldn't ask. Well, just let him pop andblaze away, Mr. Frederick. Mrs. Harris. Has anyone seen Mrs. Harris?- Oh, oh. When is the [inaudible]people coming, Mr. Frederick? She's in her little room. Fetch her out of there. Where is Mrs. Harris? Uh, what? What? Mrs. Harris. Referring to my husband, Mr. Tatham? Oh, Mr. Frederick, if you'remother, lord bless her, could see you, two buttons. My cousin says it-- My husband, Mr. Tatham, will-- [interposing voices] And don't I know what itis to have the landlord come with his hello, hello, there's three weeks due and another week running on. Do you know when-- He were a respectable manand a capital seat of business. Five shillings for 20,000 pounds-- That's because it's thecolor of the Queen's eyes. And she set the fashion for usin eyes, as in everything else. [inaudible] flies, catch them alive. Ivory flies, catch them alive. All flies, catch them alive. Didn't you hear me, you perverse imp? Or shall I call the law on you? Go on. Penny for one. Three ha'pennies for two. Tuppence for three. Go on. Get your flypapers off the only regular fly boy in the business. New-fashioned armlets. One a penny. New-fashioned armlets. Best jeweler's gold. New-fashioned armlets. Well, [inaudible]. Won't be anything today. People have stopped so awful near. I tell you, they don'teven lose things no more. - Oh, rubbish. - One glove. Oh. Found in fourth row of stalls. Two bits of writing. I'll have one of your blue sugars for it. Ah-ha. Well, that's nothing, there. Blue sugar, yes. Fingers. Finger bowls. Blue sugar. Oh, I see what you mean, to me. Finger bowls, yeah. Finger bowls. Finger bowls? It's only sugar. Bah, dinner, fingers. Quality. Oh, nonsense. Yeah. People that's quality justhas neither to earn their dinner nor cook it, but just toopen their mouths and eat it. Can't dirty their hands. So at dinner, has to have glasses to wash them in afterwards. Well, you owe me three pence for that. I'm not giving you anything else for it. Of course not. An old customer like me? - That's very unfair. After all these years and allI've done for you and the boy. Oh, no. Boy, boy. And his mother, your sister. Oh, what's wrong with that, then? Look at him, dusty old, musty old thing, you. SHOPKEEPER: Well, I can't helpthat this place is untidy. Everything in here has beenpawned to find someone in food. SHOPKEEPER: I need help. And if it hasn't been pawned, it's been sold, because it weren'tgood enough to be pawned. But there is no question of it. Of course I shall have Mr. Bowring. He is the man now. His credit is immense. Jim tells me he can borrow anything he likes against his Peruvian mines. Grandfather only an East India director. So, his grandfather wasonly a East India director. I shall seat her next to Lord Paramount. If you have Lord Paramount,you'll have to have the Duke. Well, if I have Bowring,I must have a duke anyway. He's so very fond of dukes. Besides, they will look very good together at my charity ballfor the destitute next month. My dear. You will have the whole government all at one end of the table. You're not having Lord North, are you now? But I must have Lord North. He can talk about the stockexchange with Mr. Bowring. But Lord North is so dull. Sh. So is Mr. Croker. But if I have the Duke, I must have Mr. Croker. But do be careful. He's just about to put outhis next smashing article in the quarterly review. And then, of course, I must have Sir John. Sir John is not dull at all. He never appears to caremuch what he is about. And men who don't appearto care what they're about are my weakness. Besides, he dines with everybody. And who dines with him? I don't know. How curious. Mr. Croker, you who know everything, do tell me who actually dines with Sir John? On quite a different matter, you forgive me changing the subject, sir. There's so much to discuss. Question of a contributionto the quarterly review. Mr. Croker, it really isn'tconvenient at the moment. The Wesley affair has been such a blow. Oh, I'm sure you have little time to think about such trivial matters. My balance is very low,I'm afraid, at the moment. It's an awful expenditure, keeping up the place at Somerset. As to what I spend on farmbuildings and draining-- what I spend on draining,my dear fellow, is something of which you have no idea. Of course. Incidentally, I had thoughtto touch on the Wesley affair in my next article for the quarterly. If you had any clues as to the line that it would be best to take? I don't know that thething isn't best left alone. You know? As to a contribution I'vejust hit upon a thought. Talk to Sir John. He's very handy and civil fellow. Maddeningly light headed maybe, but always ready, and very rich. I know. I know. I've known Sir John for many years, of course. Why, only the other day Iwas with the Duke, and he-- how is the Duke? His influenza? My father-in-law is much better, thank you. And he reminded me of a most amusing anecdote. We were talking about the Peninsular War-- At which point myfather-in-law added, why, I spent all my life in trying to guess what was on the other side of the hill. All the business of war,and indeed all the business of life, is to endeavor to find out what you don't know by what you do. That's what I call guessing what is at the other side of the hill. At the other side of the hill. I have been very tardy in coming to see you. I'd be much engaged for several of your matters, not the least being the Wesley business. What a really, really dreadful man. Oh, quite. Just in case, let me tell youfirst that I have lately seen my authority, whose nameI cannot of course reveal, who tells me-- this is in the greatest confidence, mind you-- who tells me that therecould be, that there may be, compensation. Naturally, if compensationis to become available, the thing looks very different. It does indeed. And I needn't tell youthat the difference to me is a very considerable one. A very considerable one. In that case, we may takepreliminary steps straightaway. We shall make waste paperof those claims yet, my friend Jarvis might say. Very bright fellow, Jarvis. He's Sir John's eagle man, you know. Sir John always has the best people. Well, we'll have to be very cautious. Peninsular War, the other side of the hill. It gives one a curious sense of looking at history through a crackin the door, does it not? [clock bell ringing] Tell me about this compensation. I understand. Tell me, do you think the new regulations on joint stock companies will protect us better-- I mean the investors-- fromthe Wesley's of this world? Nothing will protect us fromthe Wesley's of this world as long as so many of us soeasily buy a man at the price he puts upon himself. Almost everyone went and bought Wesley, and his puffed up businesses,without looking at them once, let alone twice. The only one I can think ofwho did not was Sir John. Or did appear not to. He was everywhere seen with Wesley, but he never bought into Wesley's? No. He appears a very light headedfellow, but he's very shrewd. Or he has very good people. And he's very wealthy. I knew very little, really. Is the stuff really there? Oh, yes. He dabbles in a bit of everything, but he has a lot of property. A lot. Land in Dorset. Houses in West End. Very distressing to admitit, but one has lost a wonder star, a great patron in it. You mean Mr. Wesley? And that I had some little reservations as to his character, I must confess to. But interest and conveniencecommonly oblige many of us to override our feelings. We have dealings ofinterest and convenience, friendships of invest and convenience, mergers of interest and convenience every day, and I was quite happy, I'm a happy nature, to pursue with Mr. Wesley a partnership, interest and convenience, whichwas to our mutual advantage. However, fate decided otherwise, as my friend Arnold likes to phrase it. I must introduce you to myfriend Arnold, by the way. He's a remarkable fellow,a superior Greek scholar, and a most interesting poet. So fate decided otherwise,and our poor little society for the encouragement of literature, taste, knowledge, and gentle education, is left bereft of a patron. Now, I know, I know, that you are just about to suggest that you should introduce me to Sir John. Of course, I should be happy to arrange a-- I'm quite sure that infiniteadvantages for both parties will result in his being madeparty to our little conspiracy directly. Oh! By the way, as you take such aninterest in sculpturing people, I'm sure you wish to meetmy good friend [inaudible], who's been wonderfullysuccessful in France recently. He's just completed a bust of the Duke Demoni, I'm sure you've heard of it. You were wrong about theLouis VI secretaire, you know. I told you I didn't like the shape of it. And, you see, it didn't sell well. If it had been good, it wouldhave fetched a thousand. Now, you remember, you promised to get me the catalog of the Duchess of Bedford sale as early as possible. I shall see to it directly. I was positively on my way. And do you know if Leopold Duel will be at the Standish sale? He is in town, and willbe at Lady Daphne's dinner on Wednesday. You will be going, no doubt, my lord. Oh, I don't know. Will I? I much prefer people cominghere to one of my good dinners to catching cold goingto one of their bad ones. It will be dull enough, too large for society, and not quite crowded enough for freedom. Sir John will be there. I like him. He is a perfect character. Has always something to tellyou and never wants anything. So, arouse ye, sons of freedom! The world seems upside down. Let it seem upside down to you. Has conned the poor manlike a thief in the country and in town. And, hey, in different parts of [inaudible], it's true what I do say. Maybe there's poverty or something on the way. That is-- evening Mrs. Harris-- that is the beauty of it.- I undertake-- [interposing voices] --we will get one thatwill wear longer and look better to the very last. Second hand. Less than half the money. Yes, but things don't fetch the tin they did. Where is Mr. Frederick? People getting stingier and stingier. Where is Mr. Frederick? Where have you been? Where have you been again,last night, Mr. Frederick? Mr. Frederick, you will see to it that Mr. Cocker makes allthe necessary arrangements for these people. But-- Mr. Cocker-- Frederick, you're arguing. You shouldn't argue. Not compatible with your position here. No business to argue. Your business is pounds, shillings, and pence, Mr. Frederick. Yes, Mr. Tatham. There's a slight discrepancyin the takings, Mr. Tatham. About 50 guineas? About 50 guineas. Uh, Peruvians. Seen the Garroways of late. Anything doing? No, not much. Fancy a handful of queer bills? 50 guineas worth. 50 guineas worth, you circular old dodger. When it comes to money, Mr. Tatham, you are a match for the very devil. Well, you know what to do. No need to go into details,is there, eh Mr. Frederick? Copper. Penny. Pound. It won't answer, no. It won't answer. That won't answer. I want more than a penny apound for them candle ends. I mean, I-- I-- ca-- ca-- can't. Ca-- ca-- ca-- can't! I want more than a penny a pound. I know what you fellows get for this stuff. I-- I ca-- ca-- can't. Tru-- tru-- truly. P-- p-- p-- p-- penny. And I know there's houses where you'll give a penny ha'penny. A penny ha'penny! P-- p-- no, fairly. I never haggle. Take them. Go on. You can have them. I never haggle, [inaudible]. But if I thought you wastrying to get the better of me, my friend, well, it's ain't, it's isn't b-- b-- b-- my inclination to-- to-- to--cheapen anyone as I thinks is fu-- fu- fu-- fair. And I was brought upquite different to buying candle ends and kitchen grease, I assure you. And I wouldn't think of offering you less than a penny ha'penny, sir, but it's such an hard fight to live. The wife sick, the little ones haven't eaten since yesterday,there's a week's rent owing, and the stuff don't sell so well. And it's ever such a longway off from the last place. I got some of the stuff so heavy. So heavy my hip's out of joint and agonizing me. And this stuff's such small sale. And it's a trade would starve a cat. You want more fluency. Even though it's all true. Or, if you find the hearts waterproof, and tears don't answer, you canalways try sweethearting them if they're servant maids. You're a likely one. [train whistle] So much for Mr. Tatham, eh Potifer? Time's not so good, eh partner? Bring taper. Not selling so well. Suppose yourself, partner. Uh-huh. Oh, it's you again, is it? Tolerable. Just tolerable. Bu-- but you called me. Did I? Didn't know I did. What would I want to do that for? Oh, well, I'll be off then. Your pinks need pinching. Tea's drawn. Oh, good. Very good. Because I want to talk business. Yeah, well, uh, as youhappen to be dropping by, I have a bit of business Iwant to talk to you about. Your business, or my business? Can you take these to Lincoln's Inn for me? Without any knowing who it's from, of course. On again? What is it? Oh, well, no, I'll have to consider. Will you not tell me what it is? Eh, what's the dodge? If I could tell you that, I could tell you. Which I can't. Ah, you're a deep one, you are. The tea, come on. Old Shem. He used to say we'd neverhave a windfall like Rush. Ah, that was a stunner, that was. And, sure enough, alongcomes the Bermondsey tragedy. We should all have done sowell out of the Mannings, sir. It's a real diabolical murder. Yeah, but you did, didn't you? Ah, yes, at the start. Once attention's away. But after that, ah. No, I've been all over thecountry with them Mannings. I mean, they've had every chance. Blank sheets, half sheets, booklets. No, see, what I wanted fromMrs. Manning was a confession. I mean, all I wanted from her was for her to clear her conscience before she left this vale of tears. Yeah. And what to I get? Her last words on the brink of eternity, I've have nothing to say, Mr. Roe, only to thank you for your kindness. Ah, no. I'm done with that woman. The public always looks to us for the last words of monsters in human form. But there's nothing more to say, Mr. Roe. It's-- it's not worth the pence. Here. Excuse me. That's it. They have no regard for art or literature. Why should they? Yeah. And then there's all the time between the murder and the trial. And unless the fiend in human form is writing beautiful, wonderful love letters, something's not going to be kept up. Love-- you want a love letter? We'll knock you up a love letter in no time. Yeah. Yeah, ah, no. No, there's one in the papers already. You see, we're thearistocracy of this street. And there's no [inaudible] giving them. They pay us just to hear us to talk. And what are we going to talk about? The Mannings, all nosy? Here today, gone tomorrow. I'm going to tell you something. 20 years, I've been in this path business. Yeah, one of the best. And I can tell you those stories Cooper. The march of intellect has put it out. No, I'm-- I'm done withresignations of prime ministers and the killing off of the Duke and the burners down on the Canterbury Cathedraland the Mannings, and-- and Pegworth and allthat-- look, the newspapers have it all. They're all at it. No, I'm getting old. And I want something different. Something of me own. I want me own paper, on my own hat. Something I can work me own self. Now, you're-- you're a manknows what he's talking about. And you have a way with words. I mean, you're-- print's open to you. It's not open to me. So what I'm saying is, what about you, uh, be in my line of business, huh? I'll take your [inaudible]out to Lincoln's Inn, you be in my line of business. Done. No, no, no, no. Not about the money. No, that's just for the-- for the paper. Words on wind. No, I-- I want something to lastand put a hundred to me name. Something about-- somethingabout the poor man. That'll reach right down tothe poor man's point of view. And, you know, take time,like, to go by, like a-- like a proper ballad, huh? Yeah. It'll be a ballad. Do you know these wall lights were made for Marie Antoinette'ssalon de jeure at Compiegne? Which, poor thing, she never used. They are perfect. I have the other pair. Really? Did you succeed at Roger's sale? In adding the little Reynoldsgirl to your Sir Joshua set? Yes. We did have some slight emotion when she started to run up the ladder, but we shut it up in our breast. She was very dear, but she is brutal. And how was Paris, Lord Yonskon? Extremely full, and verygay, and not a vestige of the-- Sir John, I'm quite sure youdon't even remember who I am. I haven't seen you for the last ever so long. You must think my head is full of butterflies. How could I possibly forget? Everyone's been waiting for you tonight. You know, I do very much regret you not being able to run over and see my bronzes. Ah, I would have liked to do so, very much. Here's our friend, Mr. Crocker. Forgive me, Sir John. My lord, his grace wonders if-- a word in your ear. I wish life were a little less polished. Everyone here is like automata. Some of them. They have to be wound up everymorning before they toilette. Some are self impelling. I'm sure you are. Who told you so? My inventive genius. I think you're laughing at me. Are you ever serious? No, very rarely. I'm very foolish. Very. I think I like a little foolishness. And what I also like is youhaven't asked me about my papa. Most people only talk to me because they want to be introduced to my papa, or see my papa, or ask something of my papa. I suppose it's only natural, as my papa is the man who has made the money. I already have the honorof knowing your papa. That's true. My papa says you're very rich. Ah ha ha. Is it true that you are very rich? Well, I manage to make ends meet. You're laughing at me again. I think it's true. I can tell. I can always tell. Can you? I could tell Mr. Wesley was a fraud, but no one would have it. You lucky fellow. You seem to have an immenseeffect upon our young charmer here. Mr. Beauchamp-Harper. I can tell you have much to say to Sir John, and I shall leave you to it. You see? I can always tell. She's a charming girl. How time flies. It seems only yesterday-- but never mind. I couldn't have dreamt of a more agreeable way of getting better acquainted with you at long last, Sir John. Is it not extraordinary, Sir John, that one might so happily go through life dying to know a person betterand knowing the right kind of people and yet somehow alwaysmiss the opportunity of getting acquainted with that person? Do you know, these wall lights were made for Marie Antoinette'scard room at Fontainblanc. The Marquess has the other pair. Really? And we share such a largenumber of intimate friends and such a range of interest. So many, I dare say,strange subjects to discuss. I know you have for manyyears been intimately connected with every ramification of theliterary and publishing world. And so one has seen our poor literature beset with difficulties and vexations. As the genius of the countrystifled under heavy expense, enormous percentages to agencies, proportionate shares awarded to publishers, and our poor authors, who write for bread, totally at the mercy of publishers, who dole out to them under painfully humiliating circumstances. And for scanty and uncertain pay. Oh, I know. I know. And so, you're going to do methe honor of suggesting that I become a patron of yoursociety for the encouragement of literature et cetera, et cetera. Ah ha ha, I know that a man of your most-- Ah, no doubt you will dome the favor of suggesting that my contribution tothe capital of the society be in keeping with my eagerness to join the rows of illustrious names adorning the front of your spectacle. One's anxiety for theadvancement of our literature and consequently the success ofthe society to does not leave one from looking to a lucrativeand beneficial investment of the associates [inaudible]. - Naturally. Naturally. In that case, of course one simply must take up the fight for the protection of this country's literature. My dear Beauchamp-Harper,how could I possibly refuse? Ah, tell me, who would bethe fortunate beneficiaries of the society's generosity? The society will give to authors, all authors. All authors. And who will judge the manuscripts submitted? Oh, I don't know. We'll naturally select a committee of persons competent to judge. Tell me, what preciselywill secure the soundness of the whole project? Why, the-- the-- immense service to the-- the-- the learningand genius of England. No, no, no, no. No. What will secure the soundness of it? I beg your pardon. You seem to have dropped something. I mean, the soundness of the whole project. Well, of course, the,uh, rules and regulations have been weighed up and discussed by persons of greatexperience and legal acumen. No, my dear Beauchamp-Harper, I mean the soundness of the project. Sir John, the-- the size of the capital alone. The size of the capital. The size of the capital andthe integrity of the director. Of course. The integrity of the director. And the integrity of the director. See, the names involved, Sir John. Lord Mulgrove, Lord Willows,Lord Winchester, Sir Robert Turney, Sir William Pever. Robert Popel, Esquire, Lord Brooks. I can't afford to go anywhere else. And I must sell. It's good wood, Mr.Picken, you must know that. It's superior mahogany. I'm only asking for 35 shillings. You see if you can get 28 shillings elsewhere. I can't afford to go elsewhere. I must sell. Thank you, sir. I shall want you tomorrow. A letter to Charing Cross.- Yes, sir. I'll be here, sir. Thank you, sir. I'll be here, sir. You know me, sir. You've got my character. Thank you, sir. Well, I did. Oh, come on. It won't take a minute. No, I saw some lovely blueribbon in here yesterday. They say that he's a lord, you know. Very good to see you again, Sir John. Here he is. I've lost-- Can I have seven poundsof coal, please, Mr. Bill? Hey you. Move out the way. You've got enough room there. I'm trying to make a living here. That's not fair. Last time you gave[inaudible] with my light. It wasn't nice. It had stuff on, didn't it? That was washed off. That was Mary down the road, wasn't it? Why did you lend it to me then? I told you she was ill, didn't I? Stagnant water is a little world in which-- in which thousands ofanimal bracket small animals enjoy existence. At first sight they seem to be without the least appearance of mouth or anytrace of organization whatever. And the flowers of the fieldafford shelter to millions of little creatures. The vast ocean is clouded with-- He's very bad today. Haven't been able to go out at all. Fashion grows to be cheap things nowadays. People gets to wear them low-figured things more and more as they [inaudible]. Where are the second handthings to come from, I ask you? Well, you'll get eightshillings on that, I dare say. Maybe even 10. I can tell. Nothing green in my eyes in that way. I've been in that line before when your sister was still with us, you know. She could tell a good thing a mile away. Whether a fancy waistcoat would go down well with the genteel people. People goes now for the new slops. Their-- their-- their green ishad by the advertisements and-- but coat's not really usedas often as they were once. Mutton pies, oh, come on have a look. Oh, lovely penny pies. Oh look, come and get them pies. Lovely fresh pies baked this morning. Fresh from the old manor. Lovely beautiful pies. Hello, Violet. No, but I'm married. It's nothing, lass, [inaudible]. Apply the composition to the place using cold water and a cloth. Rub it in, leave it to dry,and when you brush it-- Hey, you! You'll have to move along, you know. I can't have the public beingbothered by the likes of you, you know. The ladies don't like the sightof the likes of you, you know. So, here it is, ladies and gentlemen. The very stuff, as I haveproved to you, is so useful, and never known to fail. Just one penny a cake. I use the very fine pinsso they're dearer for people as has a penny to spendlikes to see things nice. And big pins might poke holes in the pictures. Yeah, but no one's going to notice. What do you know, you devil? You don't know nothing. I don't know nothing? You don't know nothing. He don't know nothing. Beg your pardon, sir. Have you seen a harp? A what? A harp. The musical instrument. Mr. Blackthorn has anengagement to play the harp. The harp was to come ahead of us with a cart. The man with the cart was toleave it for Mr. Blackthorn. This is Mr. Blackthorn. I haven't seen no Mr. Blackthorn. I haven't seen no cart. I haven't seen no harp. How'd you do? You don't know where ourharp is, I'll be bound. Catch them alive. Catch them alive. Catch them alive. Catch them alive. Catch them alive. It's Mr. Blackthorn. He's got an engagement to play the harp. What a lark, eh? What do you do here? I clerk. Check clerk. Pound, shillings, and pence. Do you know aboutprofessional disappointment? He who has never seen thechild of his nightly toil on the printed page can never know what it is to be stimulatedto frenzy by the sight of that printed page discarded. Floating away in the gutter. How do we like it, Potifer? Hmm? I think we like it. Runners. Scarlet. Beans. And, um, [inaudible], wall flower. - Is this where you live?- Yes. Like it? Nothing could do me so well. Where you come from? Well, London. Mothers rag and bottle shop. Dolly shop. Unlicensed pawn shop. Takes what the pawns won't have. You? It's me work. He comes from Shropshire, buthe's fond of the roving life. I come from London. Me father was an [inaudible] and me mother was a feather dresser. I was married young. He was an house painter. We had a little boy. But he was a gay man, very gay. Spent his income to the last penny. Sometimes we hadn't astitch but what was in pawn. Good thing I've beenbrought up to the small way. When our little boy died, my husband left and never came back no more. Everything in the world was upset, you see. Mr. Blackthorn was very kind to me. He gave me half a sovereign togive the undertaker something to let a man come and throwa pall over the coffin so it wouldn't be seenexactly like a parish funeral. Then I took up with Mr. Blackthorn. Has he always played the harp? No. He's a poet, really. He can do anything. He's very clever, writes most beautiful. Poems, a tragedy, songs. Will you sit down? But people took their advantage on him. The tragedy was a dreadful failure. He couldn't humor it. It was not getting hisrights that made him ill. It's like the notion has stuck with him that he's got to go around thewaste men, the places that uses waste paper, to findprintings of his tragedy. I'm used to it. I don't mind. Ah, but it is a great thing. Second nature. I sell these mats, pen andneedle cards, bit of tape. So we make ends meet. The up end and the pin end. Tea? I grew up in mother's dolly shop. Between one chair with three legs, one chest, little sailor,and three saucepans with no handles on their whole. Listening to mother. One altar chair, chipped, and cracked. One pudding basin, ditto. One plain cup, no saucer. Hmm. I'll give you tuppence anda farthing for that, love. Is that all? Oh come on, give us thruppence. Oh, tuppence two farthings. Tuppence two farthings or nothing. Hmm. I lived under the counter, watching their feet coming and going. Coming and going. Feet with no shoes, shoes withholes, shoes with no soles, made you wonder how they stayed on. Small feet with no shoes. Not decent. You must have some tea now, dear. Something warm inside you. Ooh. Ooh. Keep the chills and the rummaging out. You must now. There. Oh, Frederick, thosesugars, stir yourself some. Can't you see, the young lady needs warming up. Comforting. There's nothing to be done with the boy. Puts me out of patiencewith him sometimes, dear. After all I've done forhim, slaving to get him up in the world, all the schooling,, all the ciphering, all the writing. She had ambition, of course,to see me make my way in a banking establishment. I was sent to Mr. Nibbs. Nibbs, Marks, andMayberry, Longbarr Street, to be considered for asituation as a copying clerk. I had a good hand. The coat was shabby. The others had coats orconnections, and jauntier. The appearance, Mr,Frederick, the appearance leaves to be desired. We like our young men to be buttoned up and to show up as first rate articles. Mother was terribly disappointed. Oof. Need some sugar. Have you seen him? Not since this morning, early. Thank you for the tea. I'd better go. He didn't have any money. I can show you around the place. He might be downstairs somewhere. He might. You see, I can't let him have any money. It's not good for him. You want to know where the evil lies? I'll tell you. It lies in that pint pot and in that quart pot. And if it wasn't for somany pots and so many pints, there wouldn't be half as much misery as there is in the world. Hey, that was, um,Campbell's for Richard III. What do you do here? Nothing much. I'm not much good at anything. I'm a sort of clerk, check clerk. Mr. Tatham calls me the nondescript. It was a doublet that had been given to Mrs. Harris that did it. She left it in pawn at mymothers, so they got acquainted and I ended up with a situation. Well, it's something, son. And who knows. Could end up becoming SirJohn's secretary, son. Now, he is someone. The Duke, further back, sir. With you, please. And the children down the lane say he sold hisself to the devil. No, I don't know what he couldhave done with a Manning. And you'll get a plainmercantile education, son. Heard all about theirwindings and their turnings. Now, that is something, son. Ah, if that isn't something,there's nothing in anything anymore. Their windings and their turnings. Oh, mother. Yes. Keep quiet, everybody. --hour, we write and write. And then from hour to hourwe rock and rock, and thereby hangs the tale. Mr. Tatham. Mr. Tatham-- [interposing voices] Well, you can't do it. You can't do it. Oh, noble fool. Oh, worthy fool. Motley's the only wear. Oh, worthy fool. One who hath been a courtierand says if ladies-- Do you want to see below? They have the gift-- they have the gift-- and in his brain, which isdry as the remainder biscuit-- You are not an actor, are you? No! Certainly not. Lot of talk. I can't bear actors. I know their tricks and their manners. No, I'm no good at anything like that. Oh, no, nothing like that. Nothing ever gets a grip in here. Brains as dry as an oldbiscuit, with strange places, crammed with observations. Oh, coming out in mangled forms. Frederick, what a fool you are. Poor mother. Yeah, I'm a little rambling, I know. Very absurd. Still, fools, like drunks,may say anything they please. No account, you see. How clear the voices sound. Oh, yes. A lot of them is louder and more thundery down here than up there. Particularly Mr. Tom. Beautiful. Into Eh, when he does theghost in "Hamlet," beautiful. Eh, Mr. Frederick? That is the best play of Shakespeare. He outdoes himself there. I have learned everythingin it, in my own head. Blind people can hold agreat deal in their head, and thinks a great deal. I feel they does. And for all the beautifulthoughts that ever a man possessed, there's none to equal a blind man's when he's by himself. Professionaldisappointment is [inaudible] confined to you and me. Many a great man has been down [inaudible]. --May have crawled out ofhis concealed starvation into some thoroughfare towatch one of his calling driving past in a carriage. You are a bad fellow, you are. Where have you been? A carriage, procured by an undeviating system of hypocrisy and humbug. Where have you been? The waste man. Waste paper man. He didn't behave well, I tell you. He was purse proud. I can tell a purse proud man by his voice. Domineering, hectoring, as an ancient Roman might speak to his slave. To his slave. It seems that a man is tobe kept when he is down. Tis queer. In answer to your question, Sir John, you know, being the repositoryof so much information of such extremely confidential nature makes one feel at times reluctant to impart communication over, say, eventhe state of the weather. It would be most unfair to-- Oh, I quite understand. Believe me. --as to the general architectural effect of the statue. Oh, careful. Careful. But if you-- I'm sure you understand this is quite ingenue. Well, the answer is the management undertook to guarantee theshareholds of Wesley's newly formed company against any loss on assets and liabilities transferred. Ah. And Lord Paramount was, atsome point, a director-- --of the new company. Directorships were thrownabout rather than recklessly. I expect it was one of those boards where the names of persons appear rather more frequently than the persons. Yes it is, sir. A perceptive and open mind. Oh, blotting paper. Dry biscuit. Besides, I thought the Duke professes it to be more becoming not to interfere respecting the statue. Tell me, have you ever thought of studying law? You would find the worldappears quite another thing. Once you have become involved with the law, you find facts becomequite different from what they hitherto appeared. Flexible. Elastic. Accommodating. You may do anything with them. Twist, turn, buy them. My dear Croker, damn the statue. It will look just as well inthe bed of the serpentine. All it is is a lot of bad management and I have been harassed enough. Besides, I'm much moreworried about the insurance for my pictures in Manchester. It appears that the gentlemenof the executive committee have declined to insure my pictures. I am most anxious, of course,to contribute my share to the Manchester exhibition. But you know, even in themost favorable circumstances, it is always dangerousremoving, packing and unpacking, and hanging so many paintings. I think of railway accidents as well. But assay, assay, Sir John, I want to hear about your little project. And you must come and admire her. You must promise to keepme posted up, Mr. Simpkins. You must admire her, my little Reynolds girl. She was very, very dear. But she is beautiful. She is beautiful, is she not? There is a fine Marilow at the Townsend sale. But it is a portrait ofan old man, and I confess, I do not like the portrait of an old man. However fine it may be, it is not pleasing. But there is another Reynolds, too. Oh, I am very undecided. Leave it. We will continue tomorrow. I think I must have that Reynolds. Hope it will not ruin me completely. The prices one pays nowadays are immense. Not to mention commissions and so on. Agents always try to humbug one so. I know. Agents, brokers, helpfulpetitioners of all kinds. Being wealthy. Oh, it's quite simple. I never give anything. One wouldn't know where tostop, as there are no rules about these things any longer. How much did you pay for theReynolds girl, [inaudible]? Over a thousand guineas. The Marquess gives nothing. But Mark, Pontifer, the Earl of Cork's brother, gives a shilling a year to 10 blind people. Lady Autway gives one shillingeach to 70 blind people on the 1st of May, every year. And fancy, Potifer, the Earl ofOupington gives two shillings and sixpence to 10 of them. The Lord High President. The Lord Treasurer, theLords Mulgrove, Williams, Petherstapleon, doodle, daddle and doodle, faddle and foodle, noodle, foodle, toodle. Pop and cackle. Crackle and cackle. Rattle and tattle. Tittle tattle and prattle. A rummy lot. A motley crew. A lord or two? A lawyer? A broker. And a banker, too. You know, there's an idea the size of a pea rattling around in my noggin. Well. What say we warm it up? Hmm? Maybe it'll grow. What a sensible characteryou are after all. Now, for the case, I have a dodge to sell. The noodle and prattle dodge, say. And the case. There's plenty of fellows aboutthat require a little shaving. Plump it out. Plump it out. But you know that they all want something different off you. Your name, your influence,your gratification, your approval, your consensus. Ah. [inaudible] You're a great man withthe words, you know that. They want you to back up their dodge. Well, maybe you ought to goin for a bit of the straw in. Tell me more. Yeah, quite a straw. Um. [inaudible] Straw, he was,uh, he was the first Straw in my time, I think. And he used to have a pitch that-- [inaudible] what do you used to do with this? He'd sell a bit of straw tosomebody passing by, you see. And he, he'd give him, uh, a bit of paper and say he daren't sowhatever the people wanted. Yes. He didn't care what it was. Religion, newspaper stuff. Anything at all. Uh-huh. So long as it could be censored, you see. And then he'd make a great todo about the secrecy of it all. And sometimes he'd give them a-- a blank paper along with the straw. And they'd fall for it. You know, because you see, the papers, they wasn't of much account. It was the straw, the straw theywere really buying, you see. My idea is growing to the size of an orange. Well, I done a bit ofstraw myself in me time, too. Well, you know the way itis for those street people. We-- we have to live by our wits. Thanks. We just have to give ourminds a chance [inaudible]. Attempt it so other people fall for it. Yes. Oh yeah, you'd be-- you'd be surprised. See, nobody likes ever havingto complain about being took in. Well, they might lose a bob or two. That hurts their feelings. But, I mean, if they, uh, if they're made to grumble about it in public, ah, that's, that's worse their pride. You know, it's the [inaudible]the [inaudible] one's. They're the-- the easiest to take. But this is what you have to do. You sooth your man into a,what's it, a compliant state of mind, you see. Grease the works, so to speak. And yet, you let on aboutthe papers, or whatever, bit at a time. Just a little bit at a time, mind you. And then you make a greatthing about to secrecy of it, you see. And that's the dodge. That's what chloroforms them. And you try it. It's irresistible. Winter's drawing in. This morning was quite chilly. Well, they say the winter'sgoing to be particularly cold. Yeah, will interfere withone's travel arrangements so. And we'll be pestered withapplications for relief. Well, if I dare say, someone in your position must been very much exposedto that sort of thing. Must be such a bore. You have no idea howone is inundated, besieged by all kinds of creatures, inthe last extremity of distress requiring seven shillings andsixpence to set them up again. And here was I, was about to take your time with another plea. You sign this, [inaudible]. The refine hunt? It will round off yourengagements for today, my lord. Yes. Thank you. My time, such as it, isat your disposal, Sir John. Oh, it's a quitenonsensical little scheme to protect our authors fromthe rapacity of the publisher. But I wouldn't dream of throwing another burden your way. Even though, seeing it in another light, it could be considered a very safe investment. One can't stress too much theneed to consider the investor. Won't you take a seat, Sir John? It is certain the investorneeds to feel secure. Someone putting out their money is entitled to expect safe return. The investor is, afterall, a delicate creature. Quite. A hothouse flower, not madefor the wintry world outside. Yes. A draft, and he withers away. Look what happened to theunfortunate shareholders of the villainous Mr. Wesley. Oh, what a really, really dreadful man. I'm told-- though, who told me? Why, it's a mystery-- when the last Wesley company was formed, only 15 pound had been takenup for each share, their nominal value being 50 pounds. The difference representing a most unfortunate liability for the shareholders in the circumstances. Dreadful. Positively Arctic conditions. Of course, there's always anextreme want of information in these matters, but I thinkthere were numerous creditors, loans, all kinds of small suppliers, all adding up to a considerable sum. And the shareholders liable to that extent. It makes one shudder. State of the company hadbeen grossly misrepresented. The same party-- I can't for the life of me think of who it was-- also told me that you hadsubscribed very heavily to that latest issue of Wesley's. In fact, I'm told that theshareholders have claimed that they should rank with the creditors to the extent of the paidup portion of the shares. Oh, that is a purely legalmatter and a very complex one, too, which one has to leavewith one's solicitors. Unfortunately, legal fees are so exorbitant. Imagine a kind of financial machine taking, as a matter ofcourse, the risk of flotations and acquisitions, and protectingthe investor from such chills. Sounds fascinating. This is, of course, quite ingenue, you know. It's most confidential. It's a mere ideafloating through the air. Ah ha ha. I myself have such a foolishincapacity for business. It may never land anywhere. It's a most interesting idea. Anyway, I shan't troubleyou with our little conspiracy for the protection of literature and the arts. Most of the capital has already been subscribed. No, no. Wait. I shall take a look at it. Well, it's these names one is after, names of persons of rank and influence. You can put me down asone of your names directly. As to subscribing, well, if thesum involved isn't too high. Oh, it could be merely nominal to start with. Say a couple of hundred? 10 shillings? 10 shillings? Two years ago. I could have got three pounds for this. That was two years ago. Good afternoon, Sir John. Oh, what a rogue and peasantslave am I. Is it not monstrous that this player here but in afiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so to his own conceit, that from her working all his visage wanned? Tears in his eyes,distraction in his aspect, a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit. And all for nothing! With forms to his conceit,and all for nothing. And all for nothing? Who's the scribbler over there? He goes around the town,young [inaudible] with his eyes in a box, offering them at a lower price than in the regular season. Mrs. Harris! What is Sir John to say to this? I ask you, gentlemen, what is Sir John to say to this scandalous, this-- he would ask for your heads,gentlemen, I don't doubt. Where is Mrs. Harris? What is the meaning of thisbill from Messires Oaks and Peak Theatrical Warehouse, forthe loan for 281 nights as from the 28th of June of a stuffed parrot for 14 pounds and one shilling? 14 pounds for the hire of what? A parrot? Why was this bird notreturned to Oats and Peak after the piece was withdrawn? I'm asking you, Mr. Frederick. I'm only a-- a-- check clerk, Mr. Tatham. Why, Mr. Frederick? Why am I-- why is Sir John--let us not forget Sir John, Mr. Frederick-- why is Sir John employing moneytakers, check takers, candle stickers, painters, wardrobe,and nondescripts such as you, would you say, Mr. Frederick? Would you take me into breakfast, Sir John? I always feel a bit daunted when old lady Daphne's children are here. Em, please do look after Sir John. 'Fraid he's engaged. She's a real heiress. She's going to have thousands and thousands. No, really, Robin. How can you? George, Robin. Sit down, for heaven's sake. Mother, please can Ihave the barouche tonight? Ask your father, who is late, as usual. Martin, you are late. Good morning. My apologies, my love. Good morning, Sir John. Morning, Jarvis. Kidneys will be cold. I'm sorry my love. I understand the leads are going really strong. Oh, I never touch railways. Why? Is it your broker's advice? No, I don't like the noise and the smoke. That doesn't sound very business-like. But I'm not at all business-like. Not at all. Please can I have the barouche tonight, sir? Ask your mother. Ah. I suppose, Sir John, youleave all that sort of thing to your broker person. Is he good? Mine's very bad. Well, I find most brokers are so-so, by which I mean so at onetime and so at another. Well, it's just like banks. Incidentally, I'm about to start a bank. Yes.I think it might be rather fun. LADY DAPHNE: Martin! You sign your own checks. I don't think it is at all suitable. Why on earth do you want to go to Africa? Why can't you read about--- Besides. Banking in this country is fearfully underdone. --with my young gentleman, with the proper letters of introduction to all the consorts. Listen to your mother. She's always right. I have bought this mostdelightful little building off Cheapside. Perfect situation. A couple of steps away from the Garroways, ha ha, for one's news. And half a step away fromJonathan's for one's lunch. George! What on earth's the matter with you? [inaudible] Take your hands from your face. I-- I can't hear what you're saying. The chops. Mother, it's Sunday and there are no chops. The butcher died on Friday, dear. The building has the mostdelicious little porch, and-- and-- it butts-- it butts ontothe cemetery of St. Dunstans, where they appear to have buriedsome great great uncle of mine. So you see, there's a very, verystrong family connection there. Ah. How very fascinating. How much did you pay for it? Oh, about 17,000, not bad. Now, anyway, capital is not lacking. We've plenty of that. No, all we need is a little business. You know, customers. Well, we are looking for someone to do some banking for us, you know. I mean, this little fancy of mine. You know, the, uh, Society forthe Protection of Literature and the Arts and so on and-- Of course. We'll do your bit of banking for you. We're delighted to. Robby, would you pass the toast, please? Loans, too. Yeah, we can make lots of loans. Dozens of loans. Dozens of them. We're-- we're-- we're just positively dying to lend people money. Ha ha ha ha. Did I tell you, Martin, that I caught William, the underbutler, selling 44 pounds of used candles? See my dear, the times we live in. Toast? Uh, no, thank you. Excessive philanthropy has brought us to this. How much did he sell them for? I don't know. James? How much did William sell those candles for? What makes my project most eligible is that it involves notrouble, no estates to manage. Really, Sir Martin, youshould join the board as well. A penny ha'penny a pound, it appears. Penny ha'penny a pound. Are you going to sack William, mother? Certainly not. His father-- I give you [inaudible], you give me [inaudible]. I sell hat. You sell. You sell [inaudible]. I thought it was you. And I thought it was you. Quite a coincidence. You were not mistaken and I'm not mistaken. How clever we are. Will you listen to me? I don't know. I'm looking for Mr Blackthorn. Will you listen to me? And who am I listening to? The gentleman in the frock coat called Sir John, a man fromHumbugshire, Mr. Frederick? Those fellas, they're allthe same with their tricks and their manners. I know Sir John is an old,old man, nearly blind, nearly deaf, living inHighbury with an housekeeper and a dozen cats. That he owns this place and lots of others. That he never goes out, and doeseverything through a secretary and a lawyer. How do you know all that? Mrs. Harris. Mrs. Harris talks too much. And you're a great deal too forward, poking your nose into thingsthat don't concern you. They sent me with a letter to Highbury once. And the old man took up a fancy to me. Or, rather, I called to hismind a fancy of his youth. An actor. His name was Richardson. He'd been the mostcelebrated Hamlet of his day. But he died very young. Sir John would have me read, ohwhat a rogue and peasant slave am I, over and over again. I think it must have beena great passion, once. He wouldn't let me go. He'd have me come back again and again. Read Hamlet to him. He'd give me business lettersto copy in order to keep me there a little longer. By the end of the year I was like his secretary. I signed his letters. I talked to his solicitor. I negotiated with his broker for him. Mother was full of ambitions. She wanted me to go out in the world. Be someone. So I went out into the world. And I found that the generalrule is that if a man is down, if he's poor, if he has nocoat, no connections, then he's to be kept down and blamed for it. Oh, Sir John was very kind to me. But it was a whim. I was a ghost. I had no coat and no connections. I was badgered and bulliedand browbeaten by old Crooks-- he was manager here before-- and by Mr. Tatham, and the other clerks. By the man at the door, the man at the bank, the man at the tax office, theman at the registration office, even the man in the coffee house. I had no coat and no connections. Then one day I took a letter from the old man to some lawyer, Stevens, Pierce,and Mables, Lincoln's Inn. I went in saying I was Sir John. I don't know what made me. I don't know what I was thinking. But men do foolish thingssometimes without knowing why. But having done it, it was easy. So easy. And it changed everything. I had a connection. The office boy opened the door for me. Their clerk showed me out. Sir John. So I borrowed some money and I bought a coat. I took great care of my coat. I cultivated my connections. I went to places where Sir John was known of, but hadn't been seen for years. And little by little, someone remembered that I was so and so's nephew,so and so's second cousin. Above all, they couldn'tfail to notice that I could dispose of $70,000 a year. Sir John's thousands. The man at the door bowed. And I behaved like a wealthy man. I was close with my pennies,circumspect with my schillings, liberal with my checks, andquite reckless with my IOUs. Little by little, I became Sir John. And it was so easy. I can't begin to tell you how easy it was. All that would stick in my head is figures. Those pounds, shillings, and pence is my subject. I took another broker, then another. Spread my funds. Sir John's funds. Played with them. Worked them. Worked them well, and made a lot of money. Made Sir John a lot of money. So it's the same old story,doing something for ourselves and making out it's for another. No. It's not that. I always thought you wasn't one of our sort. It's not that. I did better. Listen. A few years ago, I met a broker and a dealer called Arthur Wesley. Very clever. Very witty. Terrible crook. Quite reckless. And very careless. I found out that he'dembezzled some little sum belonging to Sir John. I knew the amount, could stateit with the utmost precision. And I pointed it out to him. That matter was settled to Sir John's advantage, and very discreetly, for whichWesley was really grateful. He introduced me to his connections. They were numerous. They were everywhere. Vast numbers of people havehad dealings with Wesley, have cheated Wesley, or trusted Wesley, or both. You don't understand, do you? Listen. I am Sir John, with so many thousand a year, dabbling in everything a little. Knowing everyone a little. A muddling sort of fellow, maybe. A little eccentric, maybe. Such a foolish, light hearted fellow. But every day, I know more. I know who's got money, and where, and how it's locked in andwith whom, by which deviousness they got it there, and why andwhom they cheated, and when, and how. Every day, I know more about their windings and their turnings. And there's more work to do yet. But what is at the end of it all? I don't know. It's a kind of madness, a fever. To win that man over and find out. Win another man over, find out more. No one can hear us up there. That's true. Are you frightened to be found out? No. But there's more work to do. There's more work to do yet. So is Tom Dunstan. And you must get Alfred todrag himself to the house and be on our side. The man of the moment,as my friend [inaudible]. Good evening, gentlemen. Mr. McClean, congratulations. Thank you. And if you don't get Alfred to vote with us, I shall never speak to you again. Oh, Daphne. I'm sure we can have thegovernment beaten if we just rouse ourselves a little. Would you say 3,000 [inaudible]. Oh, I don't know. Uh, 3,000? 10,000? I really wouldn't know. I've no head for figures at all. I-- I shall consult with my people on that. Now you absolutely must promise me to come to my charity ball for the destitute. Everybody will be there. Do you suppose it possible that a man like my father-in-law-- --change about the statue. But there's been a most important skirmish in the Commons about it. Hughs, Waitley, Dunscombeare all with us. We have the government dead beat. Indefinably loose. Three weeks in Somerset-- Women our age have made the appetite for gain into a virtue. They've started to confusecommercial endeavor with greed, financial acumen with sharpness. It is a climate for fraud. It's not half as awful as nothaving anything to amuse one. It's very disagreeable thing. Is a very disagreeable thing to be harassed about your money. Perhaps I could see you on Friday. If only one had thetime and the inclination. What is there to stop us? How are we to tell if a manis sound as well as clever? Why shouldn't we glide with the same easy lubricity from being highly confidentto merely foolhardy? Our friend Mr. Croker iswas very busy this evening. If he gets it right, in a few minutes Mr. Shillibeer will have a duke on his board. Might be advisable for you to-- Mr. Shillibeer, about[inaudible], I'm in favor of-- Look at them all surrounding Bowring. Bowring's clever. Very clever. Once everything is in place, we can look to very high profits. And very greedy. He'll stop at nothing. He has a nose for undervalued assets. He just bought an Italianengineering company, refloated it, and made a vast profit. His enterprises will growand grow and grow, rather like our ladies' skirts, until their size becomes dreadfully inconvenient and makes them liable to stumble. You mean he'll break his neck, like Wesley? They've all forgotten Wesley already. For a while, they kept theirmouths more tightly than usual, looked at one another suspiciously. But Wesley's already forgotten. As you mention Wesley, you know, I've always been rather curious about what happened to some of his assets. I-- I know very little about these things, but assets unloaded very early on, before the company was floated. My head is so muddled aboutthese things, you know, but I do remember that there was some property. You know, I'm rather looking forward to this meeting of the board ofthe Society for the Protection of Literature.I think they're rather fun. Obviously everyone one knows seems to be on it. Croker, you mean. His rushing all overthe place makes me giddy. And besides, you know,there's too much money about. Too much loose money. [inaudible], Dunham, the coal merchant. His carbonic majesty. And Mr. Shillibeer, the man who has made the money, ever so much money. Their horizons, however, are a little cramped. Other than buying anothercoalfield, more ironworks, or maybe a railway, and dabblingin a little philanthropy, what are they to do with it? But surely someone will come along to help them out of their predicament. Someone like Bowring? Hmm. Or Wesley? The banking of this country isvery much underdone, you know. All this loose money, this underused capital could be so much better harnessed. Making the money make moremoney, and more money still. If we had financial houses large enough to be able to carry the burden of risk. Large enough to be respectable, and respectable enough to be desirable. Large enough to command almost any sum at will. And powerful enough to be able to interfere almost instantaneously. Flexible enough to be able to be in a position to be called uponat any point, at any level. Imagine a financial house-- A house? Necessarily, one house would become more powerful than the othersuntil it gained control. It would be able to mastermind a flotation, raise loans, move funds to accommodate-- And then [inaudible] the market. Control the value of the stockof its subsidiaries, of course. Convert share holdings into borrowing, debt into shareholdings,direct, stabilize the market. For the common good. Its size and its ability to carry risk would make it so secure andso attractive to investors, it could only grow and grow. What about the skirts? The skirts? The ladies skirts. Ah ha ha. It all depends upon who is inside them. SIR JOHN: Ah. You mean the integrity andsoundness of the management. Did you know that the um, wall lights were made for, uh, Marie Antoinette's card room at, uh, Compeigne. Compeigne? I thought it was Fountainblanc? And all for nothing? Because it suits that work atthe newspapers, that's right. But you know that yourself. Do I? Go on with it. Of course you do. Hey, which would you saywas the worse [inaudible]? How far Jack Cryer announced Lewis Phillips after being shot at andmaking a few bucks of it, too. Yeah, all the stock jobbers. Buying and selling on the rumorthat the French government is falling. And making thousands. But I know the prejudicethat goes on about the streets, and I can tell you this much. In the matter ofbusiness, the man of the-- the man of the streets far more ruthers than the man of the shops. Ah. No, I-- I been instreets where everybody's just making a living out of allsorts, all classes of roguery. And what are they? I can tell you what they are. They're like-- yeah, they'relike that bit of a pencil there to a tree, comparedwith them-- them rich fellas. And them taking onthemselves to decide what's good for the rest of us. Huh. Yeah, and I know-- I know them stories about-- about rogues and thieves in the lodging houses. Nothing to the rogues andthieves above in the banks and pla-- places. Yeah. And you know, they alwaysstart off once upon a time, and it was a good time,though it wasn't my time. This is where we change it, for the poetry. Once upon a time, andit's not such a good time, but it is my time, and yourtime, and everyone else's time. Yeah. Now that's the dodge. Now, you want-- you want togive the words a bit of a sway. You melt the pot. - Yeah, like music. Yeah, now Jim O'Neil, now,he does the Sound of the Shirt on the fiddle and it's great. It's-- it's funny. It's like 1,000 bricksfalling off the back of a car. [crash] Yeah, but I'm no vocalist, you see. I-- I want music in the words, like. Whichever gives along to Shakespeare's. To astonish me landlady. Huh? Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Well, no. See, what we want now is a chorus, you see. We need to have-- We-- you mean a jingle? Yeah. No, not a-- no. A chorus. Don't be putting words inme mouth I never spoke. See, every ballad has to have a-- have a chorus. It was the right kind of chorus, well, that, that sells the ballad, you see. That's-- that's important. [singing] What Danny hasn't spoken yet-- That's stunning. That's great. Stunning. Oh, [inaudible]. [inaudible] That'll dancea bob or two out of them. Ha ha. First the happened-- ah, that's good. Croker has been lambasting,in the quarterly review, this poor little fellow who has put out some silly little book, butwho is a protege of mine, and he's very unhappy. If the society could look afterhim and make him happy again, Sir John, I'm sure Ishould match my commitment to it with my gratitude. SIR JOHN: Oh, I'm sure weshall find some way of making everything as smooth as can be. I should be most grateful. Do help yourself to [speaking french]. I so do detest the fuss, and most of all, getting my name dragged into the papers. Oh, I find most people love tosee their names in the papers, short of having their statueat the top of the arch on Constitution Hill. Oh ho! Ooh, that's there too. There seems to be nothingelse for the government or anyone else to think about. Lord Paramount gets quiteheated on the subject. Paramount is easily roused by anything touching his father-in-lawor any one of his family. He can get very fierce about it. A family man. Quite splendid, Paramount. He has only one idea in his head, and he sticks to with quitemagnificent determination. Unfortunately, it's usually the wrong one. May that be the case with the guarantee to the Wesley shareholders? Pinched himself into a real fortress. Probably. But then everyone was humbugged by that. But why? The way of the world. It is a masquerade. You may listen to all sentiments and opinions, but everything you hear and seehas only one object, plunder. And in their blind expectation of plunder, people are willing to swallowanything and crave for more? Everything is so loosened. There are no rules,except for a sort of code of conduct within society. But that is a very fickle setof rules, set by snobbishness. Don't disparage snobbishness, which is the very spring of society. It replaces self esteem for those who cannot afford the real thing. I grant you, that wouldn'tstop anyone falling for Wesley. Only someone like Paramount could afford to do big stakes, whereas I, I have to be careful with my spending. The prices of everything nowadays have risen and become so immense. You must have some [speaking french]. I hope it still is. I shall pour it for you. It needs a little sugar to be added. Or, if you just want one [inaudible]. I wanted to tell you that we'll be leaving at the end of the month. Why? He wants to go to Birmingham. He has a sister there. Well, the truth is, he can't settle. It's a pity. I wasn't doing badly with themats and the other things. He's a good man. No better man walked in two shoes. But a confined life doesn't suit him. The roving spirit, it's strong upon him. I'm sorry. I liked it here. Look, Mr. Frederick. I don't want to pretend anything. Nor do I want to go round and round to anything, because there's always a straight way to everything. I know I don't understandall the particulars of it, but I've been thinking on it,and I've been thinking on it. And I don't see how you can beso intimate with such deep tars as them people without starting to see through their eyes a little. What you mean? What I mean is, don't youthink that their slippery, eel-like crawlys might grow on you? Don't you think that they're windings and their turnings might grow on you? That you'll forget plaindealing and plain speaking? You think it would be wiser to cut? Well, my dear, of course it would. It's much wiser. One's mind needs to be sovery, very clear at all times. And that's really wearing. It's very wearing indeed. Mr. Frederick, what I'msaying can't be laughed aside. I'm not laughing. What if you get used to their ways? I shan't get used to them. I'm studying them. It's a mechanism that's long wanted looking at. And I mean to look at it. Do you really think you will cause something better if you do? You don't see what I mean, do you? I mean to know how its springs,and its cogs, and its wheels all fit together. I mean to know itsworkings, all its workings. I'm mean to see- I can see that you'll start meaning things that you just mean, andwill always only just mean. Can't you see-- I can see you twistingand turning and making out. I can see you sinking your real character into the mere doing of it. Why? Why do you nag me so? Why do you go after melike a teasing, biting flea that won't let me sit easy? Mr. Frederick, thosepeople, they care for nobody. Nor does nobody care for them. They're all the same withtheir tricks and their manners. They're as like one another as peas in the boiling. How could they be different? They don't put themselves, onlytheir money, into what they do. And there's no variety in that, is there? So they must all do the same. It stands to reason. A man who has no money has toput himself into what he does. And it's only him whoknows exactly what that is. That's what wants looking at. Frederick, Mr. Tatham'slooking for you everywhere. There's no telling what a manmay do one day, Mr. Frederick. There's things that a man may dothat put him far above everyone else, even if he doesn'tknow of it himself, nor even if no one knows of it. ACTOR: And in the torches of mine ears did pour the leprous distillment. [inaudible] It doth posset andcurd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood. These intricacies-- Oh, we'll-- we'll keep theterms as simple as possible. It is, after all, the simplest of loans. Sum of 700 pounds. Redeemable in three months. That came off uncommonly well, Trott. Now, we must buckle down to business, pick up every share of the society we can. Bowring Globe's goingdown very nicely, Sir John. I should think we shouldbe able to come in at 65. Much obliged for the accommodation, you know. Don't mention it. I really can't see what it is about the Society for the Protection of what have you-- Literature? That I have such afoolish, fancy, of course. It's not very business-like. Oh, but I'm not. I'm not at all. No head for business, no. I must just see what I can see through the fog of my own folly. And what I can see. What I can see. I wish you were more business-like here. Have you sold him your shares? Yes. The society could extendthe sales of its publications by allowing a discount to its shareholder. But which publications? Where are the authors? The flotation has been a great success. The capital has been entirely subscribed, the mahogany polished, the stationary printed, the directors have breakfasted and dined. In short, the project iscomplete, but for projects. Where are the authors,my dear Beauchamp-Harper? It seems your people and my people have come to a satisfactoryarrangement over the sale of my shares of the society. I was really only most anxious to ask whether you would accept to remain on the board in an honorary capacity. Delighted. There would be a fee, naturally. I dare say there might be some expenses. Expenses? Of course. There are bound to be some expenses. Of course. I say. Here I'm buying the quarterly. They're absolutely brokered. Really? That will secure Croker. Papa wishes to get into Parliament. Oh. What do you think I'll be paying for it? 200,000. Bowring's furious. He wants the quarterly, Croker, and the Duke. [laughing] Copper. Welsh tin. Batchworths. The [inaudible] Steam Navigation Company. That's Bowring. Vernan, Boovery, andWitworth, that's Bowring too. And so it's Hydraulic. [inaudible] Syndicate. The market looks good. And here we have theSociety for the Protection and Encouragement of Literature. The entire lot. Well, Trott, Shall we makea dash with our spratt's for the capture of this whale? This is devilish annoying. You know Shillibeer has bought the quarterly? [inaudible] it.This is devilish annoying. If Shillibeer has Croker, he will hook the Duke. And you wish to hook the Duke? Sir John, I have ballrooms to fill. And you need names to harmonize with the trust and confidence. Look not just to the peerage, Mr. Bowring. Look to the arts. Look to literature for your names. Listen to this. Graham Scott Robinson Esquire. Sir Peter Tatlock. Robert Popwell. Lord Winchester. Sir William Pether. Lord Pomfrit. And Lord Paramount. And he's paying 500 pounds into the society. A third in shares of Consolidated Investment Company, and twothirds in Bowring Globe. Just in time. They're up already tonight. And Overstone has been very busy. Very busy indeed, sir. Overstone is playing ball like I haven't seen anyone play ball before. ConsolidatedInvestment closed at 153. 153. - Quite extraordinary. Gentlemen. Someone is buying and buyingConsolidated Investment. Sir John's people? I believe so, yes. Trott? Are you ready? Are all your little friends ready? Isn't it too soon, Sir John? Are you ready? Consolidated Investmentsare up at 210 today. They will be up again tomorrow. Precisely. Will there be a message? When you receive it, we let loose. TROTT: We unload? We unload. TROTT: Everything? Everything, my little Trott. It's no use creeping around. I know you're here. And me, trying to be so very discreet. May I? Make yourself at home. Don't stand upon ceremony. You don't belong in this old wilderness, you see. Do you? I have something to tell you, you know. And you had better listen to me. When Trotts receives thisfrom one of your one-legged cross-eyed frayed out, favorite messengers, he will start to sell. He will sell Consolidated Investment first, then the Bowring Globes. We've taken quite a fancyto this game, haven't we? Overstone will step in with what's left of the Peruvians andBatchworth and the Hydraulic. By the time of high change,the lot will be gone. We shall clear a million on settling day. Why are you telling me all that? A million pounds. Just think of it. A million pounds. Think of scattering the shiners out there. A million pounds worth ofshillings and half crowns. To the flypaper boys, tothe girl selling chickweed, the man selling prints atthruppence, the man making at a tuppence a dozen, the boy making brushes at threepence two farthings a dozen, and the woman across the way stitching shirts for tuppence two farthings for a whole day's work. There's more than 30 houses in this court, and no less than eight rooms in every house. Now, there are eight ornine people in some rooms, I know, but say there werejust four people in every room. How many is what? Well, 900-- 960. Pounds, shillings, and pence is my subject. Now, there are 12 courtslike it in this street alone. Some 10,000 people livingon five or six pence a day. What's your million to them? The injustice remains. Oh, can't you see, you scatterbrained fellow, how one million can become two? Can't you see howbeautifully it all works? Can't you see that as long asthe illusion persists, as long as I can walk through their drawing rooms and tell by theircountenance and the curvature of their spines that I am worth that million, then I can make another million. And another. For you to spread about. And what happens to the pride of a man who has to look about him at thecountenance of other people to see what he's worth? Don't get so put about. Can't you see, you idiot,that you've caught the fever? Can't you see? You can't play such deepgames without being took, and once you've took to the business, you can never get out of it. It's that girl who's turned you, you know. Hmm? The early gooseberry. Look here, sir. Come on. Look at me, straight in the face. I beg to know, is it right or is it wrong? You look here, Mr. Frederick. I don't have to remind you thatI have full power of attorney from old Sir John, and that I'veincreased his capital tenfold. And-- You know very well that's not what I mean. I mean the perpetual unfathomable deceitful game you're playing. Even the rules themselvesare fraudulent. I mean, selling a rigged articleand juggling with the credulity of other people, softening andsmoothing to win them over, japing and jesting to get the better of them. [laughing] But everyone does it, Mr. Frederick. This is a commercial countryin which every man is out to outwit another in a kindof universal dovetailedness of sharp practices. Everyone is at it, you know. Not just in the banks and the shops, but in your lanes, and yourcourts, and your houses. All your 10,000 people are at it. Yeah, but I-- Old tea leaves into new. Sawdust into coffee. Lime into pure. Water into beer. Shavings into shoddy. All cheating for the sake of a farthing here and a penny there. All the same. A man must do what he can. But they are poor, sir. How can a rich man justify himself by what a poor man does? There's no common sense in that. Law, common justice. You are poor, Mr. Frederick. Look at you. You poor shabby creature. Strip a man of his coat and what is he? Remove the connections and who are you? You're a moping, solitary, weed. A nondescript. A mountebank, made to be set up and badgered and bullied and knocked overand set up again, like skittles. Made to be kept down. You poor thing. But I-- no. That is where you are wrong. That is not me. Mother always wanted me to be someone. I said it wouldn't answer. That it wasn't me. Old Crooks bullied me,badgered me, but it wasn't me. Mr. Tatham and old SirJohn, it's not me they see. It's always being thus with me. That coat, the shiny studs,the silk hat, the smooth talk, the slippery way, and the million pounds, that isn't me, either. Nor is it me who hasconverse with the foxy crooks and fatuous old cheat's that you have risen with and are so familiar with. Who is me? I don't know. I'm so adaptable, you see. Tis a baffler. Who is me? I should like to know, ifmerely for information. You are a fool. But you are the foolwho will do this madness, mischievous and splendid. I was in the shop at one time. So busy-- My husband does not likeme to talk about this-- Has Overstone anything to do it? Yes. And Trott and Ellis, Sir John's people. Has anyone heard anything? No one said anythinglast night at [inaudible]. --around the room in five minutes, obviously. What will be aroundthe room in five minutes? Nothing to do withyou, my dear [inaudible]. --going to publish my article about the knobbed gowns of Nonesuch? I have not. I wonder why Sir John hasn't come? There is ever so much talk of him tonight. Sir John. Have you seen Sir John? Sir John! I say, Sir John, favor me withyou attention, if you please, Sir John. - Bowring. I feel I must correct a slight error. Sir John is a gentlemen ofvery advanced years living in total seclusion in Highburywith an ancient retainer and twelve cats. My name is Frederick. Mr. Frederick. I'm a check clerk at a theater. It's my business to balancepounds, shillings, and pence. I have balanced pounds, shillings, and pence for many years. Mr. Tatham, my manager, willbe pleased to give a reference to anyone wishing toinquire about my abilities in that respect. I have with me, at the present moment, 987,000 thousand pounds, 12 shillings, and 8 pence, in Bank of England notes. Almost a million pounds. It's my purpose here to settlea few outstanding accounts, some of which are long overdue. On consulting your head clerk, you will find that your house received today 750 pounds in satisfaction of the loan you had the kindness to extend to me. On inspections of the books, I discovered a small errors of 10 poundsto your disadvantage, sir. If you will accept? Surely, Sir John, this is not the time. Not the time, nor the place. Never mind. Mutual extinction. Reminds me of a fellow mygrandfather used to know, fellow named Rigsby. Have you heard anything about this million? Did you say a million? A million pounds. A million. Have you seen what Sir John is carrying? Have you heard what he's doing? A feint, my dear Henry, clearly a feint. A million pounds. What is going on? Will somebody pleasetell me what is going on? A million pounds. Don't concern yourself, Mr. Bowring. It's money quite legitimately brought into existence throughknowledge, financial cunning, and a sense of timing. Quite legitimately. Something about a million pounds. Legitimately, that is,within the rules that we know. They are few, and they serve but a few. Deregulation is the cry. But where are the rules? We do not want them unless we can bend them. What's going on? They say Bowring Globe'shave got the end of it. I suppose everything has. In March 1856, you were adirector to Wesley Financial Enterprises, a subsidiary of Wesley and Company, Lord Paramount, were you not? And? Wesley FinancialEnterprises was successfully floated in May of that year under the name of Wesley Financial Services, and yousubscribed to a large amount of the capital. However, only a portion ofthe capital was called up. And the directors of Wesley andCompany, the parent company, guaranteed the shareholdersagainst any losses involved in the transfer of assets ofWesley Financial Enterprises, the wholly owned subsidiaryto Wesley Financial Services, a public company. Unfortunately, Wesley FinancialEnterprises had done poorly and suffered severe losses, and its assets were heavily mortgaged. So it was decided to call up the remainder of the capital, at which point, Lord Paramount, you resigned from the board. What's more, you and other shareholders contended that you couldn'tbe held liable on the ground that Wesley's situation had beenfundamentally misrepresented. Quite, quite fundamentallymisrepresented. What's more, you claimed that you should be compensated for lossessuffered on the paid up portion of the share. There is an exaggeration here. Is not this verysingular, Lord Paramount? And what strange rule permits it? How can you, Lord Paramount, be a director with such responsibility inMarch and a creditor in July? This is absolute nonsense. I only did what other people did. I don't know what other people did. I only know what I did. I did it believing in thehonesty and experience of those who approached me. Precisely. What other people did. We invented banking,discounting, stock holding, and other financial intricacies. We've created an ever more complicated and delicate financial machine. And it works on what? What fuels it? Oils it? Keeps it going? What other people did? Rumor? Wildest rumor. The paltry belief that becausea man is rich and powerful, he must therefore be sound, andit wouldn't do to cross him. The great conviction that enterprises, which are like so much wind, canfeed off one another endlessly. And the mere size andspeed of the monetary flow will keep them afloat. What on earth is he talking about? Where will it end? Who knows to what pitchthe science of manipulating investors' funds will advance. Who knows what walls of oriental subtlety will be invented to create the illusion of a separation betweenconflicting business interests? Who knows what contortedlines financial ingenuity will learn to draw between optimistic promotion and misrepresentation of fact, between craftiness and deceit, cunning and fraud. Did you not say, Sir Thomas, it all depends upon who is in them? Shortly before hisenterprises started to fail, Wesley sold some of his mostvaluable assets, some property, well under what it wasworth, to you, Sir Thomas. Property which is nowvalued at 10 times as much. Were you not on the board at the time, Sir Thomas? I wonder-- no, I don't wonder. I know. I know something about almosteveryone here, gentlemen, and can state the amountwith the utmost precision. I know a story of houses in the East End, bought and sold withoutpayment of the purchase money as to the buying, but withreceipt of the purchase money as to the selling. What is all this? What nonsense? I know-- What did he say? I know! I know! I, ha ha, fooled you! And this very nearly fooled me. In the back street, in yards,the lanes, and the courts, where I come from, I see men,mere men, weak, deceitful sometimes, shabby, gullible,struggling to exist. Here, I can see men, meremen, weak, deceitful, shabby, gullible, arguing about bitter returns on money for which they've done nothing. I mean, in the yards and on thecourts, I see men, mere men, struggling to exist. Laying down entire lives in the making of the wealth of this country. Here I can see men no better, no wiser, taking upon themselves to dispose of it. It may be that so many yearsof balancing pounds, shillings, and pence have given me a peculiar turn of mind, and that like someone with a chaffed skin, I've become sensible tothe smallest irregularity, the merest discrepancy. But a million pounds in the hands of one man with the exactknowledge of 10,000 others eking an existence out offive or six shillings a week is a discrepancy unendurable. How very dear and sweet to get so worked up over one's principles. I do have a weakness for a paladin [inaudible]. Done it again! Done it again! Done it again, again, again. And such a pretty, pretty bubble, too. Do you think they buy many knitted mats in Birmingham, eh Potifer? Listen, Potifer. Once upon a time, and itisn't such a very good time, but it is my time, and your time, and everyone' else's time, some men I know, their blood is blue. Swells, fops, and bucks, a motley crew. Toffs, gentlemen, a lord or two. Lawyers, brokers, and bankers too. They deals when err they speaks and acts, with friends and foes and laws and facts in such a sweeping way. Some men I know, their houses poor, their shoes is worn, their trade obscure, whatever will some food procure,because tomorrow is never sure. They're men as knows the price of bread, and the landlord they've learned to dread. Yet they haven't spoken yet. Some men I know and they are rich, oh, somehow it sticks to them like pitch. Mere men, little men of little mind, not evil, nor even yetunkind, with the loveless pity the poor detest. They do what err they thinks isbest, in such a sweeping way. Poor men's work so they do degrade. Judge their worth by the sums they've made. Buy 'em, sell 'em,without contest, for they do not know what's best. They work and toil without a rest. They know the people withthe [inaudible] is best. Yet, they've never spoken yet. [music playing]
