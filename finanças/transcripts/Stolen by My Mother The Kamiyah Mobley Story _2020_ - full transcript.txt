Then now I find out... I ain't got a damn clue? What you talkin' about? It's just totally just... Messed up. You wanna talk about it? No. [Alexis narrates] this is my mama, gloria, and I love her with my whole heart. Everyone was excited about this pregnancy, especially my grandparents... ...And my mom's boyfriend, charles. A man ain't a man till he has a child of his own. [Sighing] [gasping] [gasping] oh, my god. Oh, lord, help me. My mom kept her miscarriage a secret. She kept going to work at the veterans' center and pretending she was still pregnant. Oh, hey, gloria. I thought you'd be on maternity leave already. When's that baby coming out, girl? [♪♪♪] [running footsteps] - hey, girl... - Hey. You're gonna hurt the baby, charles. Okay, when's my baby gonna come, huh? Soon, charles. Mm... This baby gonna make a whole new man outta me, right?

[♪♪♪] [news report] jacksonville central hospital remains on lockdown tonight as dozens of sheriff's officers and fbi agents comb through every corner of the large medical complex for a missing baby girl. Kamiyah mobley disappeared from her mother's arms when she was just hours old, making every mother's worst nightmare a reality for this young mother, shanara mobley. [Sobbing] please! Please bring my baby back to me! If you don't have no kids... I mean, how do you think I feel? That's our first child! - [Baby crying] that could be my only child! Please, please, please, bring my baby back to me! Kamiyah is mine! Bring kamiyah back to me! I don't do nothin' to nobody! [Anguished sobbing] [♪♪♪] [father] I can't wait. I'm sure she'll... Oh, here she is! - [Mother] girl! Oh, my god! [All exclaiming] oh, gloria. Oh... - My goodness. Watch her head. Oh, look at how beautiful. She looks just like you did. [Father] poor girl. Daddy. Oh, my god, look at her. Sit down there, mama. Hi, sweetness. Oh... You didn't have to do this by yourself. Why didn't you call anybody? I mean, I went into labor at work. I mean, it's 80 miles from here. I didn't have no insurance, so they rushed me to the er, and she just popped out. She's an angel, isn't she? [Sister] yes, she is. Charles know he got a beautiful daughter? Yeah, I mean, I called. I... I left word. Somebody will tell him. But you know how it is, for most men, though. They don't feel like a baby is real until she can fetch his slippers. Tell me. Ain't that right? Come on. [Mother] oh, she is so beautiful. [Gloria] give her to me. Oh, my gosh. Look at the baby. That's my baby. [Kissing] I love you so much, baby. Mama loves you so much. [News report] the fbi has run down over 3,000 leads... I want the kidnappers to know we are determined to find that baby. [Craig on news] all those people out there, talking about us, hinting we might have done this, you know, the cops cleared us right away, even though we always felt like they saw us as suspects, but, you know, at the end of the day, our baby is still out there. She's still gone. [Shanara] it beats you up, not knowing nothin'. I wonder, "what is she like? What kind of food is she eating? Is she safe?" I just want my baby back-- [turning tv off] - bruh. - Yo. How you gonna tell me jordan better than magic? - Greatest of all time, son. - Child, please. I don't even know why you come over. Child, please. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa... [car approaching] what's the difference between a baby mama and a dog? [Baby crying] - shit! What the hell, charles? Come here, baby, come here, come here, come here... - [crying] - oh, no, no, no. You okay? - [Crying] the fan is right there. This is how you watch your daughter? You said having a kid was gonna make you responsible, when it's not. You ain't never gonna grow up. Watch it, girl. You don't talk to me like that. You know what, charles? I'm done. Get out. All y'all get out. You too! Get out. [Alexis] and just like that, my mom was done with charles. And stay out. She wasn't gonna have anyone putting me in danger... No exceptions. You're okay. Come on. My mom showered me with attention, especially since she lost her boys in a custody battle, so I was her obsession, but I didn't mind. Most of the time, I felt blessed.

Well, I'm new, but I plan to stick around. - Do you, now? - Mm-hmm. [Alexis] funny thing, watching your mom flirt with a guy. I wanted her to be happy, but it had been just the two of us for so long, I wasn't sure if I was ready to share her. [Girl] that your mama? Is that your daddy? I think they like each other. [Laughing] yeah. I guess so. You got a dad? He been gone for a while now. You got a mom? His ex-wife... So you know what that means. If I know my dad, you and I might have to like each other. You okay with that? [Alexis] arika seemed to know exactly what was going on, while I was clueless. I'd always wanted an older sister, a confidante, but something about her intimidated me. [♪♪♪] [chuckling] - so... - Mm-hmm? Are you nervous? Of course I'm nervous. Why? I want to make a good impression. My family is gonna love you, just like I do. How about that? [Oskie] yeah, I hope so. [Gloria giggling] [kissing] [giggling] mama, daddy! I want y'all to meet somebody. This is oskie. [Mother] well, hello. ♪ Here you are ♪ ♪ some kind of miracle ♪ ♪ whoa, whoa, whoa ♪ [kissing] ♪ some kind of miracle ♪ ♪ whoa, whoa, whoa ♪ [alexis] so much for it being just mom and me. Our family had now doubled in size. [Gloria] my god, so what are you sayin'? [Oskie] I'm saying, arika feels you expect more from her than from alexis. 'Cause I do expect more from her. She's older, she's a mother, she needs to be more responsible. [Oskie] arika works for everything she has, clothes, pocket money, baby stuff. You hand that girl whatever she wants. She's spoiled, and that's not good for a young girl. [Gloria] I know. Okay, I just... I want her to focus on her studies so she can have a better life than me. Every road is hard. She's got to learn that, and she ain't gonna learn if you keep babying her. [Alexis] like all families, we had our troubles, but listen... My family always know how to have a good time. [♪♪♪] okay! Now, come on, stop playin', before the food get cold, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on... This cake is delicious. My piece is just too big. Now, that's your second big piece... [laughing] you gotta slow down. Honey, I've been meaning to ask. How did that interview at work go today? He said I needed a college degree for the job. I work hard all these years just to hear that I'm not educated enough for a promotion? I mean... That just ain't right. That is not fair. Mom, you probably know more than anybody else in that place. No, it's not, but I've made a decision. I'm going to college. Baby... You all right with that? Well... I guess I got me a college sweetheart. [Everyone laughing] aw, yeah, you do, come here. Aw. I'll drink to that. Will you carry my books home from school? You bet. [Laughter] [alexis] I had no idea that those good times would end so soon. [Crowd murmuring] [♪♪♪] all rise! Be seated. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] my only daughter is turning 16 today, so I figured lunch... And a day of retail therapy. - Ooh! - Gimme some! [Laughing] okay. You done messed up now, ma, you done messed up. [Laughing] no, you better just shop on the sale rack, that's what you better do. Aw, nah... [laughing] [kids laugh and play in distance] [alexis] shanara never gave up. Every July, she celebrated my birthday with a cake, always wrapping up a piece for me. By the time they found me, there were 18 pieces of cake sitting in her freezer. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [kids laugh and play in distance] [gloria] oof, I'm stuffed. [Alexis] mom, look at this free sample. Think this is gonna cause a riot? I think if that lipstick is on your lips, and you in my house, it's gonna definitely be a riot. Put it back. But I'm tryin' to be a little spicy... - Oh... - And you won't let me. Because you are not spicy, all right? You sweet. You my sweet bae. A little bit of hair, a little bit of paint-- "makes a woman what she ain't. A lady." And you not a lady yet. You still my baby. A little grown. No. - A little-- - no-- how y'all doing, lexi, miss gloria? Honey, how you feeling? Susie, you gonna drop the baby on your shift? It's my last week. Can I have your job? [Susie] hell, yeah. Let me ask alex. Uh-uh. Grades, that's what you need to be focused on. You don't have time for a job. Yes, ma'am, but you know how much I want my own money. For what? I buy you everything you need. Look at all these bags! That's beside the point. - Mm. - Please? What's the point? The point is, I want to get it for myself. A'ight, alex says that you know the customers and this menu better than me, and despite that mouth of yours, everyone loves you. If you want this job, it's yours. Ma, please. Okay, but if your grades suffer, you're fired. Yes, ma'am. Okay, cool. Bring us two sundaes with extra hot fudge. We celebrating her birthday. Happy birthday, lexi. - Thank you. - The sundaes are on us. I'll get your uniform, but you gotta bring in your social security card before you get started. Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. Thank you.

I got something I need to tell you. Ma, what's going on? I did something. I did something bad. You might think it's unforgivable. Ma, you're scaring me. [Mizrahi] ms. Mobley, how old were you in late 1997, early 1998? 15. And did you have a relationship with a craig aiken? Yes, I did. [Mizrahi] did you become pregnant from that relationship with mr. Aiken? Yes, I did. [Mizrahi] what were your first thoughts when you found out you were pregnant? I was happy. I felt like god gave me a chance to straighten up, so I had a reason to. [Crying] [shanara sobbing] you take your time. No one will be rushed in this courtroom. [Shanara crying] you know how they say people don't change overnight? Well, that's not true. I was a teenager, runnin' away, havin' fun, and one night I was takin' a nap on my uncle's floor, and I woke up, and I was just like, "I don't want to run the streets no more." I wanted to do better. I was pregnant, but I didn't... I didn't know it yet. You're not my daughter. I took you, a long time ago-- no, I said I wasn't gonna say "took." I stole you. What the hell? Ma, you know this ain't funny. That's you. [♪♪♪] whoa, what? Ma, what is this? I don't even know who you are anymore. Yes, you do. I'm the woman who raised you. I'm the woman who loves you. All these years. Did everybody know except me? No. Nobody knew. Not even oskie. I mean, I guess I gotta tell him now, but... Yeah, you go ahead and do that. Wait a minute, let me finish talking to you! Wait! [Insistent knocking] hey, lexi. What's wrong? I thought I knew exactly who I was. Then now I find out... I ain't got a damn clue? You want to talk about it? No. Not now. I just really needed to see you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [alexis] I needed someone to lean on, and swerve, he was always there for me. I mean, we loved each other as friends, but at that moment, we became more. [♪♪♪] ...More than friends. [♪♪♪] [sobbing] I had just lost my baby, and I thought I was-- that was somebody else's baby! You didn't think to tell me? You didn't think you owed me that? I'm sorry. Listen... Please just listen to me. I was just trying to protect you-- - no! No, no, no, no-- - yes! You were trying to protect yourself! This is so unlike you. I can't believe-- [door opening] but I can fix this. I can make this right. - No! I will call the police and turn myself in! Okay, yeah-- - [alexis] what? - I can, um-- - oh... No! Ma, you can't do that. Baby, I have to. Ma, please, please. No, ma, ma, ma. I hate the fact that you lied to me-- I'm sorry. But you still my mom. Oh, baby. I don't care about that other family. You're all I know. Ma, please, just think about it. We can-we can go into hiding, we can run away. I can come with you. Ma, please. What kind of life would that be? I can't live without you! You have-- listen, I'm going to pray about this. - Ma, no! - I am gonna-- ma, just think about this, please! [Oskie] stop it! That's it. You're my wife. I made a vow. I love you, and I'm going to stand behind you. Oh, I love you too. Oh, god, thank you. Oh, thank you... [alexis] we loved her, so we made a silent pact. We'd live with this secret and hope for the best, but a dark cloud settled over our family. [♪♪♪] you need to talk? [Chuckling] lettin' me off the hook, huh? Hey. You know you can talk to me about anything. I know. Okay. [Alexis] I wasn't mad at her, at least not yet, but I wondered, "how did she kidnap me? Did she take the stairs? What color scrubs was she wearing?" But I couldn't ask her any of those questions. She had enough to worry about. [♪♪♪] [swerve] light me up. [Alexis] hold on. I got you. [Gloria] alexis manigo! Are you crazy? Huh? This boy got you skipping school now? Go! What the hell is wrong with you? I didn't even skip school. I just left early, that's all. Don't fix your lips to lie, 'cause the school already called me at work, and told me that not only were you cutting class, but you done dropped all your honors classes, and now they wanna know if everything is okay at home. [Alexis chuckles] you tell 'em I gotta get high all the time 'cause that's the only way I'ma deal with the fact that you stole me? [Sighing] I'm sorry, ma. It's just too much for me. So you're smoking weed? Is that all you're doing? Answer me. Is there anything else? [Alexis] no. But I ain't lettin' it go. Oh, god. Lord. Lord jesus, help me at this time-- [scoffing] ma, what are you doin'? Nothin' is funny. I'm praying. We need god to give us a miracle. Sit your behind down and pray with me. Come on. Lord, please bless my family, and please deliver them from the mistakes I made. Let them... Oh, jesus. Just bless them, lord, please. [♪♪♪] [typing] [shanara] it's stressful to wake up every day knowing your child is out there, and you have no way to reach her, and it beats you up not knowing nothin'. [Alexis] I tried not to think about who I came from, but curiosity got the best of me. I stalked them online, read their posts, wondering if we'd ever be sisters, or even friends. I really wanted to be close to them, but the thing was I worried how I could love another family without giving up the one I got. [Keying in number] [call ringing] [telephone ringing] hello? Who is this, please? [Beeping phone off] [dial tone] [♪♪♪] what are you doing up? You okay? I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. Look... I know I've been a bitch lately, and I'm sorry. This kid thing is intense. I don't sleep. I can hardly stand myself, so I get why you avoid me. No. You're fine. I'm just goin' through some stuff... Everything okay with gloria? Makes me jealous, how she gives you everything you want. You all think I'm spoiled, that I don't want to work. [Chuckling] honestly, I thought... You were allergic to it. I'm desperate to work. I just can't. Why not? I don't have my paperwork, birth certificate, social security... You can't work without it. What's up with that? Why can't your mom get you the papers? Come on, we're sisters. Anything you say stays right here, I promise. [♪♪♪] [arika] tell me. She's not my mom. What, are you adopted or something? 'Cause that ain't no-- because she took me. Stole me from a hospital from my birth mom. Oskie knows. We're so scared that somebody's gonna find out. Oh, you poor baby. Now I gotta carry around this secret, and it weighs a damn ton. If someone stole my baby, I don't know what I'd do. I'd lose my mind. [Dial tone] [keying in number] [call ringing] [cell phone vibrating] hello? Happy birthday, kamiyah.

We received some information regarding your step-sister, and we'd like to ask you some questions. [Mizrahi] can you tell the judge what was going through your mind and your heart when you first saw kamiyah again after all these years? [Shanara] oh, my god... I saw me. I mean, she don't look like me, but everything about her is me... The police want me to bring you in for a dna test. No. No! Sweetie, they not asking me. Ma, you need to get up outta here. The tone of her voice, her hair, the way she walk, everything is just... Me. [Mother] how could you do something like that? Let her talk. I was in a dark place, and, um... But you were pregnant. What happened to the other baby? I lost it. I had a miscarriage, and I... And I took her. What is done is done. You're our daughter. How can we help? I need an attorney, daddy. I'm in trouble. Okay. Lord help us. [Alexis] what happens now? They come for me. When? I don't know, tomorrow, maybe? The day after? You know, I'm blessed, g, to have someone like you love me the way that you do. Baby... I will love you forever. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. I need to get in the house and make some calls. You know I've got to call your brothers. Um... Why don't you spend the night at swerve's tonight? You sure? Yeah. I mean, come back in the morning, and I'll make a big breakfast. No use in you sitting around here. I'm sure they're gonna give us till the weekend, at least. Is it okay if I tell him? You need to tell him. You're gonna need him now.

Damn, what's wrong with y'all? Whose house is this? It's mine! I doubt that. Where are your parents? They're out of town, where you should be. I could tell by your badge, y'all ain't even local. This ain't legal. Alexis, I'm detective rodney holly from florida. I've been working this case for 18 years, so I know you had nothing to do with this. You just... Got raised by the wrong family. Watch your mouth. If you've been working this case for 18 years, then you know I was raised in exactly the right family. [Holly] with all due respect, your birth parents have waited a long time for this day. You take all the time you need. Clear out, give her some space. [♪♪♪] [alexis] where they at?

Did they hurt you? I am fine, okay? I was just worried that I wasn't gonna get to see you. [Sobbing] don't cry, baby. Ma, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? You are gonna live your life. No... And I am gonna put my faith in the lord, and I'm gonna trust that my attorney can figure out what's best. Tell them that you gave me the best life possible. Everything, everything I ever needed, everything I ever wanted, everything I ever loved. Baby... You gotta stop worrying about me, okay, and live your own life. Listen to me, lexi... I want you to behave... And I want you to be respectful to your family. Ain't nobody gonna tell me who my mom is. Ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do, and what to feel, and you can't make me see somebody I want nothin' to do with. Try. Think of them as your bonus family. It's just more love. Ain't nobody ever died from too much love. [Holly] five more minutes. That's her meds and her glasses. She needs both. I'll make sure they're transferred to florida with your mama. [Alexis] thank you. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry that your life got turned upside down... But I want you to be okay. If you need help, I want you to get it. You hear me? Yeah. [Crying] [gloria] you hear me? [Sobbing] I love you so much, ma. I know. I love you more. You know that. [Door lock buzzes] [♪♪♪] [crying] [sobbing] [woman] hang on a second. That is them.

[Alexis] she helped me escape the reporters... Alexis, we just need a couple minutes of your time! Just a few questions! [Alexis] ...And found me an attorney. [Alexis] no matter how hard I try, I can't do it all. I can't be everything for everybody. That's my job. You're about to face a tsunami. The press, your new family, your mom's needs. Exactly. That's why I need a job. You'll get one, but it'll take a little time to set up a brand-new life-- social security card, birth certificate. Can you help? I'd be honored to. If alexis will have me, and if she promises to do exactly what I tell her. [Chuckling] I don't think she's ever made that promise before. [Chuckling] okay. I promise not to do anything without asking the boss first. You got it, girl. I'm taking over. You ready? I ain't got no choice. Now, the press are in a frenzy. We've got to get in front of the story, control the narrative, that's the only way they'll leave you alone. Don't worry about that. I got that. That's the last thing I'm worried about. I'm more worried about meeting my new family. I can help with that, too. If you need me, I'll be there. Nah. I gotta do that part on my own. You ready, kiddo? Here they come. Kamiyah! [Crying joyfully] kamiyah! Kamiyah... Come here, come here, come here. [Shanara sobbing] shanara. Craig. [Sobbing] I've been looking for you. [Sobbing] oh, I've been lookin' for you.

Alexis says even though some people think she should hate her mom, expect her to, she doesn't, and won't. I love my mom. She will always be my mom. Except for one mistake, my mom gave me the perfect life. I was blessed, and I never had a reason to question that. Well, you did us all proud, sweetie. Thanks, grandma. I'm still processing it all. I understand it will take time. I need to give my biological family a chance. I owe them that.

Hey. [Shanara] I just found you, now I gotta watch you on tv talking about a woman who stole you from me? You belong to me, kamiyah. Why do I have to compete with a kidnapper for your love? That ain't fair to me. I am so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings at all. You know I'm still coming down next month to get to know y'all better. Maybe we can work on our relationship then, but as of now, I'm just not ready to do what you want. I gotta go. Bye.

So many opportunities for you here. You know I'm a country mouse. Look, I know you got a life there, but you got a whole new life here, girl, huh? Our family welcoming you with open arms. Huh? Come on, now, give us a chance. Look, I need a photo of this. I don't want to forget this night. Hey, hey, cuz! Hey, come on, man, take this picture, man. [♪♪♪] yeah. [Camera shutter snapping] yeah, yeah. That's what's up, girl. ♪ ...And I just wanna have some fun ♪ ♪ we came here to party ♪ [shanara] you know all my kids make the best macaroni and cheese. You learn how to cook yet? Oh, no. I can order takeout like a champ, though. [Laughing] you know, you'd be a fine cook if you was raised in this family. I could teach you a thing or two. My grandma taught me everything I know. [Cell phone vibrating] we're bondin', kamiyah, and she's callin'? You know, it's not right, you goin' on to the tv people, talking about your mom this, your mom that. I'm your mother, kamiyah, and I'm still hurtin', so, baby, you're gonna have to pick one of us. Wait... If you expect me to stop loving her just because you want me to love you, look, I'm sorry, but that'll never happen. You listen to me. I don't want you talking to that woman again. You hear me? She's poisoning you against me, can't you see that? Now, if I have to, I'll get a court order to keep her away from you. What? Yes, I said it. Yo, where do you think you're going-- [johnson] gloria, you understand, if you take the prosecution's offer, you give up your right to a trial? So does this mean she goes to jail for sure? Yes, it does. For how long? Maximum 22 years, minimum 12 years. No! Baby... Gloria, if you reject the plea deal and go to trial, you could get life in prison. No. I can't take that chance. I won't take that chance. Ma, just think about it. [Gloria] no. I'm not gonna put you through the hell of a trial. I'll take the plea. [Johnson] at the hearing, we'll make the case for the most lenient sentence possible. [♪♪♪] I just feel like a rope in a tug of war, both sides just pulling on me with... Love, and demands on my time. Throw in the damn media hounding me, everybody around town talking about me... I'm just sick of all of this. I just wanna roll up in a ball and hide from them all. Listen up, this hearing's gonna be hard on you. It's gonna be hard on everyone, so prepare yourself. I know. Kidnapping is a serious crime, and gloria's sentence has to reflect that to deter others, so even though she did a fantastic job raising you, the judge can't just slap her on the wrist. You understand? I understand. [Crowd shouting] how could she have so many supporters, craig? She stole my baby. That's right, mama. What's wrong with people? [Crowd shouting] [camera shutters clicking] [shouting] [mizrahi] let's go back to the hospital. Did you think that gloria williams was a nurse? She's beautiful. Yes, ma'am, she sure is. Her name kamiyah. She was dressed like one. [Mizrahi] was she nice? [Shanara] she was real nice. Proper tone and everything. [Gloria] I've been doing this a long time, and I can see how tired you are. Give her to me. [Mizrahi] did you trust her? Ms. Mobley, did you trust her? Yes. She asked if I needed help. She came in, picked up kamiyah, looked at her, smiled... I know you hate to be away from her even for a second, but we keep the thermometers in the nursery. I'll be gone 15 minutes, and then I'ma bring her right back, and y'all can keep getting to know each other. ...And then she told me that all new babies have to be checked for a temperature... - Okay? - Okay. All right... In the meantime, new mother, get yourself some rest. Okay? I'll be right back. ...And eventually she was gonna have to take her outta the room to be checked. [♪♪♪] ms. Mobley, has time healed these wounds? [Sobbing] it doesn't heal now. I have kids now, but... I'm still hurting. That is my baby. I am your mother, kamiyah! I am your mother, and your name is kamiyah mobley! [Mizrahi] can any sentence that the judge gives ms. Williams change the 18 years that you lost with your daughter? There's only one sentence, and I don't think she's eligible for that, and that's death. [Crowd murmuring] [crowd murmuring] [camera shutter clicking] mrs. Williams, describe your relationship with charles manigo. I, um... I was always taught that if you love somebody, they'll love you back. That wasn't the case with charles. He took me to a dark place... You ain't never gonna grow up. You see what I mean? ...And my soul and my spirit broke. Get out. I don't have the bruises anymore, and thankfully, god has healed my heart, so... When you were in that relationship with mr. Manigo, did you become pregnant? Yes, I did. I already had two kids, but... Charles wanted a baby. He thought that it would, um... It would make him stable. I believed him. I wanted to believe him, but after the stress, and the abuse... Things, um... They didn't turn out like we planned, so... [johnson] what did you do then? I, um... I was headed home from work, and I got into walterboro, and, um, I just, I just kept driving on 95 south. It was like I was on autopilot. [Johnson] where were you going? My life was out of control. I had, um, lost custody of my boys, I lost the baby I was carrying, and me and charles... I just... I felt like I didn't... I didn't have anything, and I couldn't tell anybody in my family, because they looked at me as this, you know, upbeat kind of a person... I just, I kept putting one foot in front of the other, and nobody knew the nightmare that I was living. [Johnson] so, you get off the highway at a hospital in jacksonville. What was your intent at that time? It definitely wasn't to take a baby, that's for sure. Did you choose shanara mobley because of her age and the fact that she was alone? No, ma'am, I-I did not. I-I didn't know whose bed I was walking up to. I just... I just saw her, and I... [♪♪♪] I thought she needed help. [Johnson] so even then, you had no intention of taking the baby? We was just talking, and, um... She was... She was so young, and... ...And she didn't know what she was gonna do... And... And, um... I... I just wanted the abuse and the pain to stop with charles, but... It never did. Mrs. Williams, is there anything you would like to express to the birth parents now? Ms. Mobley and mr. Aiken, I, um... I ask god every day to renew your hearts, and your minds, to-to give you a peace that comes with knowing his word. I wronged you... [sniffling] and for that, I'm sorry. I can't imagine what this has been like for you, and I never... I never meant to hurt your family, but I know that I did, and... And, um... I just want you to know that... I'm not a bad person. I did a wrong thing, and I hope that-- hope that one day you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Alexis-- kamiyah-- kamiyah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you, baby. [Justin] so? Talk to me. She got me. Mm-hmm. We could talk about anything. Whatever it was, she'd give me the straight facts. She was my number-one go-to. I mean, like, now I have you... Which is cool, but it's not like you're always around. Ta and swerve, they help, but I don't know, without my mom, I just... Still feel alone. I know this is really hard, and I can't say it's all gonna come out the way we want... But it's time to start building your new life. This should help. Your new social security card. Go ahead, open it up. Kamiyah mobley. I guess that's who I am now. This crime was calculated and premeditated. This woman, who allegedly lost a baby months earlier, drove all the way down to florida, and just happens to find a hospital right off the side of the road. She goes straight to the maternity ward, and finds herself a young mother. She brought with her a car seat and a baby bag, evidence of a cold, calculated premeditation, and that shows you the character of this woman... [crowd murmuring] that's right. ...And that heinous crime continued for 18 years. It was a selfish act committed by a selfish woman, and it destroyed a family, and I urge this court not to mitigate your sentence because somehow gloria williams is a good person. Gloria williams is not a good person. You cannot be a good person and kidnap a baby... [♪♪♪] okay. Okay, baby. There... [♪♪♪] [crowd murmuring] ...And there is no way that you can restore what this defendant stole from shanara mobley and craig aiken... ...But your sentence can define the way our society views the crimes that this defendant committed. The state of florida is asking for the maximum sentence under the plea agreement of 22 years in florida state prison. [Crowd gasping] thank you, your honor. [Crowd murmuring] your honor... Looking at gloria williams' many accomplishments, and her place of respect in her church and in her community, especially what a wonderful parent she has been... [♪♪♪] ...As is evidenced by the amazing young woman that kamiyah mobley has become... [gloria] I am not the only graduate! My baby graduated today too! Daddy, get our picture. - Uh-huh. [Camera shutter clicking] - there, that's nice. - Ooh, now, come on, boys. I want to take one with all my kids. - All right. - Okay. All right, say cheese. Cheese! ...The defense is humbly asking the court to impose a very reasonable and appropriate sentence, well below the maximum. We thank the court for its time and understanding. [Judge] thank you. This is a very unusual case, and I'm going to consider everything that's been presented here to make sure that I am as thorough as possible. Imposition of sentencing will be one month from now on Friday, June 8th. Court is adjourned. [Bailiff] all rise! Be brave. [Cell phone vibrating] ma... How are you? Hey, baby. I miss you. What's going on up there? Tell me everything. Well, I'm workin'. Which, by the way, sucks. Big time. Hmm. Well, I got one word for that. "College." [Chuckling] you still swervin'? Funny, ma. Yeah. What? What's wrong, baby? I just got so much pressure on me. It's overwhelming. You ain't here. I gotta pay my own bills, get health insurance... I just hate being an adult in an instant. Everything bugs me. I'm becoming an angry bitch. I keep telling you to get some counseling, girl. It's no shame in that. How are you? You doing okay? I just hate thinking about you in there. I'm praying a lot, and, um... Tryin' to get these young ones in here to learn from my mistakes. How come you didn't call me on mother's day? I... I wanted to give you time with your birth mother. She's all you got in the world. Did you see her for mother's day? So, what did you get me for mother's day? I'm so sorry. Look, I've been super busy, and plus I'm paying for everything now. But I bet you had enough money to send a criminal a card. [♪♪♪] you are my mom. I love you. I will never love anyone else as a mother. I can't just turn that off like a light switch. I need to see you, and talk to you, and they're trying to take that away too. Did something happen with shanara? I just don't want to see her, not now, maybe sometime, but listen, not now. Baby... She's hurting, okay? She's in a lot of pain, but I promise you, she's gonna come around. Well, that's on her, okay, not me. Okay, sweetie, um... What else is goin' on? Bring me up to speed. You know I only got 15 minutes for these calls. It can't be 15 minutes already. Well, it is getting close, so let's just talk as long as we can, okay? I love you. I love you, too, ma. I'm gonna see you at the sentencing, right? No, baby, um, you know what, it's gonna be so quick, I don't even think you should come and put yourself through that. Are you sure? I'm sure, and you can come and see me after. I mean, I know it'll be hard with work and all, but... Hey, I got paid. So I put money on your commissary, for mother's day. That is... That's just like you, always thinking of others. My time is up, baby, I gotta go. I love you. Bye. I have listened carefully to all the testimony. At this time, ms. Williams, would you proceed to the bench with your attorneys, please. This is a very hard and emotional day. There are no winners. Many people have suffered, including the defendant, gloria williams. On the first count of kidnapping, under florida law, I'm sentencing you to state prison for 18 years. Oh, no. [Scattered applause] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] on the second count, interference with custody, I'm sentencing you to five years in state prison. [Applause] this family suffered not knowing where their infant was. Ms. Williams is awarded credit for time served of 511 days. Your two sentences will run concurrently. Ms. Williams, you have 30 days from today in which to appeal the legalities of this proceedings. Court is adjourned. [Bangs gavel] [bailiff] all rise! [♪♪♪] we'll get through this. We'll get through this together, okay? God loves you. [♪♪♪] you wanna scream? Wanna throw something? There's gotta be somethin' going on in there. Yeah... I think I lost my debit card. I need to find it. [Alexis] I knew it was coming, but it hurt anyway. Before this, I could always depend on my mom... And now I was on my own. I had to be strong and find my way without her. So, what you gonna miss most about this place? Yo, what you talkin' about? I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, you are. You're getting the hell up outta here, lex. It's time to start doing right for yourself. People see that, they'll leave you be. Who made you boss? Look, be your own damn boss. Get outta here, go to college. Make a new life. When I'm here, and I close my eyes, I see her. I love that. Look, these are just places. The memories... You can take those with you. Hey, how are you? [Cell phone vibrating] hey, nana. What? Okay, look, I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way. [Heart monitor beeping] grandpa, I don't know what I'ma do without you... But I'ma be okay. A'ight? I promise. I mean, you taught me... You taught me how to live a good life. So, like... It's okay. It's okay if you... If you need to go right now. I know that you love me, and I love you so damn much. [Incoming call ringing] there's my girl. Hi, baby. Ma... How's it going, g? The real question is how are you? Right, and don't say "fine" or "okay," 'cause I know it had to be hard losing your grandpa. Yeah. The hits just keep comin'. Okay, well, you talk to somebody. As long as I'm talking to you, I'm feeling better. Okay, well, you know, I don't have a lot of time, so I gotta do my mom thing-- let me guess. "Go to church, apply to college, stay off weed, practice safe sex..." does that cover it all? Okay, stop being a smartass. What's going on with the applications? Um... I heard I could get a scholarship to a college in florida, but... I don't know if I wanna do that. Okay, well, at least you'll be closer to me, and to your birth parents. How is that goin'? You're my mom. You will always be my only mom. When I close my eyes at night, I see your face. My daddy's okay, though swerve tells me not to trust him. Okay, well, I'm tellin' you to keep trying. You hear me? And wherever you end up for school, get out of walterboro. I want your life to be better than mine. I'm determined to make you proud, ma, but leaving here scares me. It's not because I love it here, but because... This is where we shared our life together. Yeah. I wanna hang onto that. Hold on. Where'd you go? You remember this? Yeah, I do. Best day ever, and it's right here. You got to go live your own life, lex. Okay. I only got a few minutes left, so, um... Do me a favor? Sing with me? [Chuckling] hold on, I gotta, you know, get it together. Clear my throat.

She cared for me for 18 years. I will always love her. [Reporter] it was a secret that forever changed two families. She says she's trying to find a balance, a way to keep everyone she loves in her life. Today, she goes by both names, her family in florida calling her kamiyah, her family in south carolina, alexis. She loves each family, and trying to navigate that water to make sure she's not in the middle of a feud, or... She doesn't want to upset anybody. She says she is optimistic, ready to move on and move forward with her now much larger family. What do you hope for the future? That I can find a better way to balance everybody and everything, you know, and not so much tension. - [Robin] it was a kidnapping that rattled the nation.
