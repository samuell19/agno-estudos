Self-proclaimed as the guru Shuroo... The guru Shuroo... Nobody knows how, but he's a miracle worker. Couldn't even be around myself... I have turned myself into a monster... - He'll change your life. - All thanks to him. Life has a habit of catching up with you. When you make your living selling stories, make sure your own story couldn't sell for a dime. Andrew? Hey. Andrew! I'm so happy to be home. Oh! I missed you. So much. Paris was a zoo. Daphne was so much worse than either of us thought. Duke has the patience of a saint, putting up with her. Although Paris seems to agree with them, so I don't know. I've got so much work to do. I've barely put anything on paper. Oh, God. I mean, you were so right. You just actually predicted everything. I don't know. Did my rebate check come? It did, right? Did it come? We need to talk. Yeah. Sure, let's talk. I'm not happy. Of course you're not happy. You need to quit your job. We have the same conversation every three months. I mean, we're gonna wake up and be 50. Shit! I'm so bored. I'm bored of this situation. What are you saying, Andrew? I've lost patience playing this role with you. Your lifestyle. You haven't let up on the booze, the blow, the smoking. I don't want my kids around this nonsense. Your kids? Andrew, your kids fucking love me. And also, I am a lot of things but boring... boring is not one of them. Case in point. Andrew, I haven't stopped in ten days. Hey, can we please just relax? And talk about this in the morning? I'm going to Florida with Mags and the kids for the week. When I come back... You're going to Florida with your ex-wife? Come on. This is not out of the blue. - If you weren't so shit faced... - Don't you... Don't you fucking dare. Don't you dare tell me that. Have fun... - in Florida, you... - What the fuck? - What the fuck? Are you serious? - Go to fucking Florida! Go to Florida! Go to fucking... - Florida with that bitch! - They fucking live there! Fucking cunt! Go! Go with that fat cunt. Go! I am leaving. You know what, Andrew? This is what happens when you settle. I, I am a successful, accomplished, beautiful woman. And that fucking intimidates you. And it always has! You slimy, fucking pencil dick, motherfucker. I am fucking leaving. I'm leaving! Do not need you! - Hello? - Hey. Edie, it's me. Guess what? I, I have left Andrew. He's having an affair with his ex-wife. Wait, are you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. Listen, can I come to your place tonight? I could totally get a hotel, I'm just... I feel traumatized. Of course, honey. Yeah, come over. Thank you. Okay, I'm coming. Auntie Parky! - M'lady. - Hey! - Hey, got you some coffee. - Thank you. You have a Bloody Mary? Nope. How you doing? I feel okay. Okay. I just need you to just stay in bed today, okay? I'll let Adrian know that we'll just see him at the event. - Have you got your speech ready? - Oh, God. What are you wearing? Stop. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll pump a look. The show must go on. I'll be okay. We're here live at the fifth annual Rogue Journal Awards. I'm speaking with Edie Maxwell. Edie, can you tell us what are the areas having the most progress? Well, emphasis is on the developing world... Where the fuck is Parker? Sorry I'm late! Better late than never! You look amazing! Hi! Which one is Getty? Let's go. Thank you, guys. Come on. Stop! Thank you guys for coming. We'll see you later. I'll see you up there. - Sorry, excuse us. - Hi! P, come on! Welcome, one and all, to the fifth annual Rogue Journal Woman of the Year Awards. Taking their rightful place in society in developing countries and escaping poverty and - taking their place in society. - Hey! All the while, there are still forces in it, - trying to turn back the clock. - Jesus Parker. I'm going to hand you off now to the founder of these awards. Is that thing supposed to be on your head? - A singular woman about town. - It's called fashion! Ladies and gentlemen, Parker Schafer. Get the fuck away from me! Hi! Thank you! Thank you. It feels really good to be here. Shit. Anyway, I can't find my speech. That's okay. I would like to say it is an honor to be here representing Rogue, honoring all of these generous, accomplished and successful women. Give it up for women SA. You know what I wondered though? I wonder why is it that the women still have to make all of the sacrifices? Me, I've sacrificed my entire adult life for the love of journalism. And what has it gotten me? Some shoes. And some clothes I could never afford if they weren't given to me. I mean, no nest egg. No kids. No relationship. In fact, I was dumped because he couldn't handle the lifestyle. Does anybody know what that means? Yeah, you know what? We are under attack. And ladies and gentlemen of the one percent, while you're busy worrying about who goes to what bathroom, and what crystals to put up your ass, America is becoming an oligarchy. I mean, the end of the world is going to be sponsored - by KK Cosmetics by... - Let me go, okay? Fucking hell. Thank you, Parker. Thank you. Look, if we don't wake up and pay attention here, we're all going that way. Hey, stop, Edie. Stop! Fuck! Fuck! Stop! Fuck! Fuck! Stop! Fuck! Fuck! Parker, I think you need to take some personal time. You can't fire me, Adrian. I built this magazine. Then why don't you act like it? That's not it! Right now, this magazine is hemorrhaging cash, and at this rate, we won't have a magazine to sell. I can't stand by you anymore. It's too much. Are you kidding me? Do I have to remind you the amount that I've done for this place? And for you? For the sacrifices that I've made? Every relationship I've ever had is doomed because of the amount that I work! This is embarrassing! What about the double standard? I remember picking your ass up from meth binges at five in the morning... That's why I got help! Look, Adrian, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Parker, you have a problem. And I am here for you, but I will not enable you. You can keep your email address, and we put together a six months severance package. Wow, Adrian. Where did it all go wrong, huh? I gotta tell you, it's a good thing. I've been turning down collaborations for a long time because of Rogue. And that is not going to continue. You're right. This could be a good thing. You should get out of New York for a little while. Put your shit in storage, and go actually fucking write, P. Go and stay with Duke in Paris for a month. Every time I go to Paris, I gain 10 pounds. Let's just put out the feelers. You're not gonna have a problem. Edie, my naked ass made the National Press. I think I need a minute. - Right. - Yeah. I mean, you gotta do something! Maybe you should meditate. Wow. Actually, there's this girl that I follow. She's raving about some center. About something, yeah. Here we go. The Shuroo Process. See? "The Shuroo Process. This process will help you become conscious of and disconnected from negative patterns of thought on a conscious level." Who is this guy writing this garbage? Oh, God. Off to the races. Thank you. Jesus, blow! It's early. Don't stay out too late. Parker, unbelievable! What you gonna do about it, babe? I mean, I have... I have left him. I have walked out. For real this time? I took his mother's camera, and I smashed it into a million pieces. - Hey. - Wait, wait. Hold on. Parker, it's 4 a.m. What are you doing? Hey. You want a glass of champagne? No, I don't want a fucking glass of champagne. You're bringing drugs into my house while my daughter's asleep next door? Do I have to remind you that Chris is asking for full custody? - I'm sorry, okay? I just... - You know... I've been under a lot of pressure. You know what? You need to take a good look at yourself because you have been on borrowed time for a while. Are you, are you actually kidding me right now? And don't think I don't know everything you've been saying - about me at the office. - The office? Where are your fancy friends now? Why are you yelling? Are you fighting? I'm sorry, honey. Your mom was telling me to go to sleep, and she's right. I should've gone to sleep. I'm sorry. I've traveled the world on a quest of knowledge. From New York to Bhutan. I've chased the ghost of Plato and Pythagoras, Confucius and Buddha, Locke and Thoreau, in hopes of finding one true universal belief system. And yet, I'm haunted by the words of my DMV driving instructor in 1995. "When you've lost control of your vehicle, it is often best to steer in to the skid." Hey, it's Edie. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you when I want to. Hey. Edie, it's me. I... just wanted to say I am so sorry. I've been such a selfish bitch, and out of my mind. And I wanted to let you know that I... I'm on my way to the Shamoo thing. I guess I'll become... conscious of... on an emotional level... Anyway, I... I'm sorry, and I love you. And I'll call you in a few days, okay? Okay. Oh, shit. - Hi. - Hi. Parker Schafer! Yeah. I am a huge fan. Oh, fuck. I love tiny tits. I mean, it's so breathtaking to see you here. Isn't this place just magical? We're gonna leave your car here, 'cause Shuroo doesn't like any reminders of the outside world on the property, so. Let's go. I'm gonna drive you. - Okay. - You ready? Isn't it beautiful, Parker? - Yeah. - I'll show you the house now. Right this way. Come on, slowpoke! All right. Now, down here is where most of the meetings take place. Cool. This is the kitchen. Excuse the mess. Just trying to get lunch made for everyone. And this is May over here. But she actually goes by Stormy for some reason. Hi. I don't like stepping on this one stair. Fucking bitch. It's the 13th, and I've already done my 12 steps. This gotta be bad luck. This is your room here. Let's get some fresh air in. Oh! Is that a rooster? How do you look so great, Parker? Are you a hugger? Sorry. Okay, well, you know what? Just wait until all that booze and coke's out of your system. I'll be back soon. In thirty. I just don't give a shit. Then why did you agree to come? For you. I'm doing this because you asked me. It's not that complicated, Nadia. I just wanna go on holiday, go for dinner. Have no stress. It's hot. And why is this walkway so long? Should've taken the train, like everybody else. Who takes an Uber to the Catskills? - Why won't they open the gate? - I don't know. This better not be some freaky shit, Nadia. Excuse me. - May I join you? - Please. - Hi. Willie. - Jane. Nice to meet you. And you. Hi. Is this a real person? Speak to an operator. I read his book. It was a gift from my crazy neighbor. It spoke to me. Yeah, well... It was all out of my comfort level, really. No way I spent that much money. That's impossible. There's just some fraudulent activity on my account. I'm Nini. - Nice to meet you. - Mark. You, you here for the Shuroo weekend? Yeah. So, how's your life? Not bad. - How about yours? - Awful. All right, we're being honest. Hungry? - Did you make it yourself? - I did. It's vegan. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh! Delicious! - Thank you. Well howdy, campers. Now don't mind my driving. I've yet to have any crashes. I wish I had been born 40 years ago. You guys are so lucky. Men these days are either gay, in relationships, or just complete dogs. I'm newly single myself. Oh, good luck with that at your age. I'm 27... 23, and I'm over the hill. - Would you like a candy? - Oh, my gosh. You are so cute. No, thank you. Hello? God, I hope there's food. I'm fucking starving, by the way. Hello? Have you been to L.A.? Oh, my God. Of course you have. I mean, I got so tired of it. I was never sexy enough, smart enough, talented enough. I was this close to getting my tits done. Crazy. So small. She needed distance. No. I needed distance between me and my life, to reflect on the trail of destruction I've left behind. And the bridges I've left burning in my wake. No. The bridges I burnt were fiery enough to have lit up the sky. Oh, my God. Now this up here is the 13th step, which I like to warn people about stepping on. But you do you. Wait, what? Something about a 13th step? This is lovely. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. You must wear the uniforms at all times. No makeup is to be worn by anyone. You are beautiful. Don't be afraid to reveal your true self. There will be silent time where no talking is allowed. There will be no contact with the outside world. There's no Wi-Fi, and good luck getting cell service. You must journal your experiences daily. Meet on the lawn at noon. Dress to meet Shuroo. Now, all y'all beautiful people. It is now time to hand in y'all's phones. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, my parents will probably... Okay, put it in. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah! Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all for coming. Don't worry. I'm just going to steal all your money and alienate you from your families. I'm kidding, of course. The reason for life is self-development, ladies and gentlemen. To understand ourselves completely. We live in an age where people are terrified of themselves. Middle class morality and self-denial have stopped us from being what we are. The conscious realization of the universe. Gods, ladies and gentlemen. Who the fuck am I, you may well ask. Let me give you some background. Twenty years ago, on the 20th of January, 1997, I died. That's funny? You guys are twisted. - I like it. - Seriously? But it wasn't my time. I was in a serious car accident. And, while I was in a coma for two weeks, I was visited by non-physical entities. They gave me the name Shuroo. Shuroo is the Hindi word for beginnings. That's why you are all here. To shuro again. If you're gonna be my devoted followers you're gonna have to learn to laugh at my jokes. All right, take a seat. I woke up changed. I felt something... ancient within me stir. I had this overwhelming need to give form to every feeling. Expression to every thought. To bring back the courage that is inherent in the human race. You all look petrified. Look, here's what I know. You have the answers, not me. You were sent to me to find the right questions. I want you to be rebels. Spiritual outlaws. Question everything that you know. It is only the weak and superficial person who takes years to process an emotion. A person who is the ruler of themself can squash sadness just as quickly as they can invent pleasure. But first, we need to hear how the world sees us. Everybody get comfortable. First impressions. I'm gonna choose two people at random. One person will be asked to give the other their first impressions. The other person will stand in silence and process the information. Who wants to go first? Jane. My love. Why don't you give us your first impressions of... Nini? Come on, Nini. Okay. Whenever you're ready. Attractive. Friendly with a love of adventure. Loves to be around people. And the center of attention. I'm pretty sure there's a shifting self-image, though. - And moods that can fluctuate... - Fluctuation... chronic feelings of emptiness. Emotional instability. Feelings of worthlessness, insecurity, impulsivity. Impaired social relationships. Well, Nina, I think it's safe to say you have borderline personality disorder. Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing. Is this terminal? I should get a second opinion. Actually, I'm glad that you brought that up. I'm cutting back on some patients, but I do have someone to refer you to, who's qualified. Wait. Are you breaking up with me? Yes. - I wouldn't say... - Well done, Jane. Come on, Nini. Let's lead the group with a round of applause for Jane's honesty. Next up, why don't we have... Parker and Nadia. Let's go. Come on. You want me to do her or her to do me? Why don't you give us your first impressions of Parker? All right. Whenever you're ready. Hi. Great style. I loved that strip down look you were rocking when you arrived. Maybe works in fashion. Not a model, though. Obviously. It looks like... you've been through a lot in your life. Maybe... not as old as you look. Probably single, looking for love. Maybe... struggles with your weight a little bit. Standoff-ish, insecure. Wow. Awesome. Great. Thank you. Well done. Well done, Nadia. Great. Why don't you stay where you are, and... Why don't we have Willie? Come on, Willie. Why don't you give us your first impressions of the lovely Nadia? Come on. Don't be shy. Come on, Willie. Yeah. A beautiful young lady. Could have the world at her feet. But... I sense a sadness. It makes me feel protective towards you. Untapped creativity. But I'm sorry, also rage. Thanks, Willie. Nadia, take my hands. I want you to repeat after me. I deserve love and abundance in my life. I deserve love and abundance in my life. Again. Really believe it this time. I want you to say it from the depths of your soul. I deserve love and abundance in my life. Wonderful stuff. Okay, that's enough, guys. Thank you. Everything that you've been through, everything that has brought you here today is part of who you are, and what will make you stronger. I wish I had just... hugged her. Told her I love her. Just adjustment, and acceptance. She came by with him, and acted like we were gonna be best friends. Happy I'm here with you guys, and... You know, it's your typical story. Girl moves to L.A. Girls' parents kidnap her. Genesis through adjustment, and acceptance. My ma stopped recognizing me around two months ago. My sisters want me to put her in a nursing home. It was just like... five years had never happened and... somehow I was crazy. I need you all to reject your sense of injury. Your sense of victimhood. Winning. - It's all about the win. - I just feel... so thankful for all the blessings in my life. Course I wanna keep her at the house. I don't wanna see her die in some shithole care facility. Shuroo allowed me to be me. And I feel so grateful for that. I wish that I had listened to her more. You know, I wish that I'd taken on-board what she wanted. I need you to reject that harsh prudery you've been forced by your entire lives. I'm sorry. Am I telling you too much? The light within me honors the light within you, ladies and gentlemen. Beautiful stuff. Are you pleased with your accommodations? Yeah. They're, they're nice. Rustic. I'm really glad you could make it. Yeah. I'm happy that you had space for me last minute. Space? For the infamous Parker Schafer we made space. God, you've seen it, haven't you? I saw it on the news. I like what you said. Great. I don't think you know how powerful you are, Parker. The effect that you have on people. I think you're lonely. I see you surrounded by lots of people all the time, but you never showed them who you really are, because you're ashamed. I think you came here because you need something. What is it you think I need? I have a few ideas. But what's the first rule of show business? - What? - Always keep them wanting more. Time is envious of all of us. Ladies and gentlemen, this moment is all that we have. Embrace the darkness that exists within your mind. Let it invade your soul like an exotic root. Embrace the darkness. Move, ladies and gentlemen! Move! Okay, guys. I just want to say incredible, incredible first day. I can really see the, the cowardice slipping away, and the soul starting to come up from its secret hiding place. As much as I'm enjoying this witty banter though, I'm gonna ask you to spend the rest of the evening in silence. I want you to peacefully witness your thoughts from today's exercises. And then after dinner, we'll go to our rooms and journal. Oh, and for the hike tomorrow, I want you to find your personal items that we asked you to bring. Make sure that they have some sort of significance. All right? We will make haste at dawn. It struck me as strange that I felt safe for the first time in... God knows how long. I realized that cynicism is easy. Clarity is the hardest of them all. Shuroo, Shuroo, let me be. Keep that pelvis far from me! Hey, stop. D'Arcy, give it back. - Stop! - Oh! - Stop. - No need to hide, my darling. This is private, stop. I'm serious. God. I think you should take a chill pill. Maybe you should. - Maybe you should. - Stop it. All right, Princess. Hey. You know who I think is really hot? Shuroo? Ew. No, Mark. - You think Shuroo's hot? - No! - No. - I can totally see it. He wants to fuck you. During the mask thing, oh, my gosh. Can you stop or the blond thing is going to be up here again? - Okay, silence? - But seriously, Parker. He's like really into you. And you're into him too. - Oh, stop. - Oh, my God. You two would be the weirdest fucking couple. That would be so good for me. Come on, girls. The tree of silence bears the fruit of peace. Hey. Hey, look! Sweetheart, I asked you to calm down. Yeah but what part of they've frozen my account do you not fucking understand? We need power of attorney. I gave you the power of attorney. As long as our insurance... Look. There's nothing else I can do for you. Fuck! Shit. Hey. Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Raring to go, I see. - Uh-huh. I'm going to kick the butt out of this hike. Good man. Yeah. I'm really going to enjoy this. Make sure you put some sunscreen on that lovely skin. I will. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. So, three words. Faith, forward, future. I want to remind you all why you are here. To begin again. To move past our negative patterns of thought and live our best lives. Right? - Right! - Right? Let me hear those vocal cords vibrate. Right? - Right! - Okay. I want you to set an intention. Think of a person or a situation you'd like to free yourself from. We're gonna hike to a powerful vortex point - I found two years ago. - What's a vortex, mate? Fuck if I know. Fuck! Let's see if it breaks. - It's good. - D'Arcy, wait up. Why do you think you're here this weekend, D'Arcy? To get laid. Yeah, but what's it about? What's it all about? All right, mate. Save me the philosophy lecture. I know enough about philosophy. I used to think if we came together, we could find a system that works. But what I've learned is that people only care about their own selfish needs. It's about the win. Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. Who's love did you crave most when you were a child? Your mother or your father's? My father. I only got to see him twice a year. And who did you have to be for your father? Captain of the rugby team. Complicit. - A version of him. - Complicit? How? I had to sit back and watch him... destroy my sister and make my mother suicidal. But you loved your father, right? I mean, you craved his attention. Doesn't every child crave their father's attention? Yeah, but you can't stand how much you craved your father's attention, D'Arcy. Rejection breeds obsession. You're terrified of being vulnerable, and you're modeling your father's bad behavior. - With your lack of... - I'm nothing like my fucking father! What personal item did you bring with you this weekend? That's very sweet. - Is that your mother? - Yeah. You think your mother made herself ill by pushing down all the anger she had for your dad. But... And I need you to hear me when I say this to you, D'Arcy. It's not your fault. Fuck. You got me. Don't wanna talk about it, though. And out. And in. And release. Great day for it! - Focus, guys. - Do not mind me. Keep the energy going. And in for three. And out. Take it easy on them, Declan. Keep your eyes closed, guys. On release, let's look to the sky. Open your eyes. Release. I guess I'd wanna be free. Free to really be myself and do what I want. I worried for so long what people thought about me... It's been such a waste of time. You know what, Jane? It sucks. It does. I mean, I'm not gonna stand here and spout a load of Namaste bullshit at you, hon. I mean, it fucking sucks, but... you have to ask yourself, "What's your next chapter?" What do you want? Gotcha. Watch your footing. Try to keep up, ladies and gentlemen. Step inside... ...the vortex! Feel the vortex in your body. In your soul. Let it enter you. The final part of today's exercise, guys. We're gonna release these personal items - into the ether. - What? This... ladies and gentlemen, represents the future. And those items that you brought today, they represent the past. Now, I know this is terrifying, but they are mere objects. I don't want to do this. Sweet Jane. I want to meet the new Jane. And so do you. What did you say to me? You said you want to set yourself, free. It's just an object. A piece of metal that's bringing you pain on a daily basis. A reminder of a painful history. You need to let it go. All of you need to let it go. Trust me. Okay. Just to be clear, you want us to throw our personal items off the ledge? Off the fucking cliff, Nini. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. We ready? On the count of three. In one... two... three! Look at that! Fuck! Beautiful stuff! Well done, Jane! So, that bitch, Parker, her journal is full of shit we can use. Come here and fuck. - Wanna jerk off on it? - My feet are filthy. Who are you getting all dolled up for? Nobody. Come on. Come on. Give me the foot. Give me the foot. All right. - Fuck yeah. - He's gonna be here soon. Michael! Michael, what did I tell you? Get over here! Hey! You okay, honey? - We're going home. - Yeah. A constant limbo between passive and active... Remembrance of my brother. A purgatory of madness. So gloomy. People just say that to me when I'm lost in thought. I think I just have resting bitch face. It's hard when no one has your back, right? What do you know about it? - You'd be surprised. - Hm. You're not crazy, Parker. Everybody else is. What was the significance of the... Plath poems? My brother gave it to me. We both love her. - Macabre. - Yeah. You ever try your hand at confessional poetry? Nope. Tell me about the young Parker. Okay. My parents had this hippie school, and we lived in the back. And my father was the principal, so I was bullied senseless. Until I met these two girls, and they were really cool, but kinda troubled. And we dyed our hair black and called ourselves witches. Nice. Yeah, until we burned down a church. Oh, shit. Yeah. Anyway, I... I keep thinking about my brother. I was carried away to this reform school. And I escaped one night, and I came back. And I remember... just begging to my parents to let me stay. And when I was carried off again, I remember my little brother just pleading with them. To not make me go back. He was beautiful. He was a dancer. I think he was gay. A few years later, he came to visit me in New York. And I, I basically made him try cocaine. I don't even know why I did it. And he took to it like a fish to water. Except they don't have cocaine in Goldenfield, Iowa. They do meth there. And he was dead in a year. Is this the first time you've talked about this? Yeah. I don't want to open that box, you know? There's so much more to you than these events, Parker. Look at what you've accomplished. You're a fucking artist. All right? You know what grace is. You know what sorrow is. And that is what makes you fascinating to the world. And you're beautiful. Yeah. Okay, campers. Let's get started on dinner. Let's go get some food. - All right? - Yeah. - You must be starving. - Yeah. M'lady. Fucking late. I'm a bit late. Don't worry. I'm good for it. Got two K here. Fucking late. Fucking late. There's nothing I can do about it, man. All right? I don't get fucked. I don't get fucked. Hey, I got a fucking now, all right? What the fuck are you doing? - Barry, what the fuck? - You wanna shit on me? - I'm gonna shit on you. - Fucking Christ, man. Hey. Are you gonna peel these? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Helping others is part of the process. - So... - Sure. Okay. I gotta go. I'll give you the rest of the money next week. You and Stormy better fucking calm down. I don't get fucked. Yeah! I am enough! I am enough! Great. Well done. Three times. So, what does it feel like? What? How does what... What does what fee like? Helping people the way you do. - Being famous. - I'm not famous, Nini. And that's not something I aspire to, just to be clear. - Yeah, but hang on. - You know you'd be in the studio. You know your life is about to change. All our lives are about to change, right? And it's not something that you can feel. You're helping people become more authentic. That's gotta feel like something. It does. It feels like something, yeah. It feels good to... feel things. - Yeah. - You're making a difference and you get recognition for it, so... You're a good looking guy, Mark. Aren't you? - Nah. - Right? - Yes. - Nah, my man. Nah. No! But... you don't walk around all day thinking about how good looking you are, do you? Or thinking about how well you take after your sick mother, which, by the way, is more admirable than anything I've ever fucking done. Just like that. That's grace. That's beauty. And that's truth. What's for dessert? Okay! Come along, Seraphina. Yeah. Good stuff. Walk with the glasses. All right. This is called... shamanic journeying. The Native Americans have been using mescaline for more than 5000 years. It provides an enhanced experience of the natural world. And gives us insight and balance of the patterns of life, Nini. Seraphina has administered the dosage within an inch of its life. So don't be afraid. And always remember, don't fight it. Okay, Jane, love. Feel it. Feel it. Okay, everybody. Bottoms up! Yeehaw! So don't be afraid. Don't fight it. Feel it. I'm... I'm gonna go on a spirit walk. Don't get lost. All right? Don't wander too far. Alone. - Okay, Parker. Be good. - Catch you later. Nadia. Nadia! It's you and me. They'll never understand our love. Get off me. Get off of me! What? What the fuck? I shut my eyes And all the world drops dead I lift up my lids And all is born again And sung me moon-struck Kissed me quite insane! I fancied you'd return The way you said You know what they say, Parker. If you expect nothing from anyone, you're never disappointed. Who's there? Your naughty little brother. Do it. I'll always be with you. I love you. Please forgive me. Are you feeling this, mate? Fuck yeah. Come on. How now, children of the forest? To the barn. Let's go to the barn. Come on. Yes, man. There's a bar. Let's go. Let's do this. We can get there. Come on. Come on. Fuck. I've lost my shoe. - Hey, cock. - Hey, cock. Hey, cock. Rita, give me that necklace. - It's from my first husband. - I don't give a shit. - Give me the necklace. - He'd fucking kill me. Give me the necklace, Rita. Welcome, gentlemen. Glad to see you made it off the reservation. How's Charlie Manson treating ya? Go, go! Fuck. Shuroo. You could at least buy me a drink first. Cervezas, mi amigos. I'm gonna go take a piss. Who's paying for this? I got it. No, it's the card. The fuck? What are you doing? - The fuck are you doing? - Taking a leak, mate. Same. Fuck. Hey. Hey. Can I have a gin and tonic please? What the fuck, Stormy? I thought you were our maid. I'm not your fucking maid. I manage... I help Declan take care of his property. What can I get...? I'll have a dark and stormy. - That's a good one! - Look what the cat dragged in! You know, you have such a wonderfully infectious laugh. Well, it's nice not to feel invisible. What do you mean? You know I cannot believe how beaten down you think you are. Jane, you are beautiful. I see you. Do you see me? Crystal clear. Okay, then. I'm gonna go to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight. See you in the morning. And I did it again. Elaborate self-sabotage. Breath in to the sky. Prayer the hands. Hands to heart. Windmill back to warrior two. Breathe in for triangle pose. Oh, fuck. In to the sky. Out, prayer the hands. Out, spread the legs. Strengthen back. Bend the legs. And up to the sky. Breathe in. Namaste, motherfuckers. Namaste. Oh, fuck me! Gone beyond the mask. We're gonna go around the group, and each person is gonna share with us their darkest, most shameful secret. We call this exercise "What I don't want you to know about me is..." Who'd like to go first? Mark. I think I might have a drinking problem. Okay. Why do you drink, Mark? I don't know. To numb myself, I guess. What are you numbing yourself from? My entire life, all I ever wanted was... to be regular. You know, like, find a girl, settle down, be happy. But... there's just always been something missing. There's been this part of me that I fucking hate. I've been blocking it out with booze and drugs for as long as I can remember. Praying that it would change and... that shit ain't working for me anymore. I can't pretend to be something I'm not. I think it's just, like, finally time to accept the fact that... I'm fucking gay. Wow. Amazing, Mark. Wow, truly. Beautiful, Mark. I think I can go next. Parker, of course. What I don't want you to know about me... is that... I came here because I had nowhere else to go. And that I judged all of you for being weak, and vulnerable. And what I don't want you to know about me is that... I feel responsible for my brother's death. And what I do want you to know about me is that... I want to change. And that I'm really grateful for this weekend, so thank you. Aww. Thanks, Parker. We're grateful for you, Parker. The truth will set you free. I think I'd like to talk next if that's okay. Yes. Of course, Nadia. I... had this uncle growing up. Uncle Pete. More money than God. He, like, bought my mom a house, he paid for my school. Everything. When my parents got divorced, my mom just couldn't take care of all four of us siblings. So, Uncle Pete offered to take care of me. And he was everything to me growing up. But then, when I was eight... he started grooming me. But it didn't feel like abuse at the time. It just felt like... I don't know. Like love, I guess. At least, that's what he told me that it was. And that, just... we had to keep it a secret because no one would understand. And it really wasn't until the past couple of years that I realized that... it was abuse. But, just the hardest pill for me to swallow has been that... my mom knew the whole time but she just turned a blind eye. She just didn't want that gravy train to stop. But I just hate that the one man that I think about... ...every day is the man that... raped me for five years. You see, guys? Letting go of pain is never easy, but the sunlight heals all wounds. Seraphina, why don't you sage the room? I think we should take a little bit of a break. Why don't we take five? All right? Let's process what happened here this afternoon, okay? I can't look at you right now. Wait! D'Arcy, please? Hey. I'm an idiot. I ruined everything. That was literally the most... bravest thing I've ever seen, Nadia. I don't know why he's so upset. He should be the one chasing after you, not me. No, it's over. He's never gonna want me now. Good. Fuck him. Woah, D'Arcy. Stay out of it, Jane. Are you out of your mind? How could you be so cruel? You know nothing about our relationship. She shared her darkest secret with you, and you dumped her. She loves you, and you've broken her heart. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Fuck! Hey! Hey, hey, hey. I don't know if she's doing okay. I think there needs to be some kind of professional... We are seeing amazing results, Parker. This is a tried and tested process, okay? Change is never easy. You know that more than anyone. Can you set up the stools? Please? - Oh, my gosh, I've got it. - Look how much taller I am! You are such a pain in my ass, you fucking whore! You don't want it now, you fucking piece of shit? Because he's watching you? You never do anything. You're fucking useless. Stupid, try and give it to me... For fuck's sake, girls. Can somebody get the cushions? - They're upstairs. - Bitch. What's on the menu today, Stormy? - Hello? - Edie. Edie, it's Parker. It's a long story but I need you to look someone up for me. Are you okay? What's going on? Where are you? P, you've gotta give me... Shit! - What is it? - Hey, I'm so sorry. Give me something. A name or something? An address. What do you need? Come on! Declan Costigan. - Spell it. - C, O, S, - T, I, G, A, N. - T, I, G... - Costigan. - Okay. I'm looking. Tell me you didn't fuck the Shampoo guy? You did, didn't you? Oh, God. "Feds raid felonious guru's routine, Declan Costigan, a former offender, has been indicted on fraud and identity theft charges?" The indict's on 14 counts shared people's personal information and signatures, false income tax returns on their behalf. - Shit, shit! Gotta go, gotta go. - Members' accounts... Fuck! This is a shitshow! Oh, my God. Stop, stop. I'm... so sorry. You're all I have in this world, Nadia. This wasn't about you. You make everything about you. I was just... angry you hadn't told me that... There's no excuse. I'm a fucking prick but I... I can change. I wanna... I wanna make you happy. Baby, please? Don't leave me. Please? Oh. What's that? Time for my run. I've got to get this body in shape. I think you look great just the way you are. And I think you should stay. So you're really not into... Yeah. That sucks. I always fall for gay guys. Sorry? This is actually going to be amazing. I've always wanted to have a gay best friend. And guess what? I promise you I will be the best fag hag ever. And you are going to get so much dick! You're fucking crazy. I know. It's a disorder. Hey, beautiful. I'm sensing some acrimony. Still upset about Nadia? She's learning to master her emotions, Parker. Dominate them. Is that a problem for you? No. I'm just wondering... have you ever turned the supernatural powers of perception on yourself? Come on. I've more than probed my soul, okay? Do you think this happened by accident? No, I'm talking about... I'm talking about identity theft. And tax fraud? - Well done, Parker. - Fourteen counts. I'm wondering where my wallet is. Congratulations. You're a real sleuth, huh? Do you want the truth or have you already made up your mind? Sure. My given name was Declan Costigan. I'm from working class Dublin. My parents were maniacs. In my late teens, my life took a... pretty dark turn. Ended up a junkie. Found myself in jail, where I shared a cell with a monk. Who, I can honestly say, saved my life. And when I got out of jail, he sent me to Peru to meet a shaman. Skywolf. I stayed with Skywolf for five years. We traveled the world together. He was on a psychic excursion... You might remember him. He became quite famous in America. Anyways, we moved to Sedona where he set up a process... He was arrested on some pretty fucking crazy charges, and he dragged me down with him. I can't be mad at him, 'cause it brought me here. Today, with you. I'm assuming that's all on the record? What I don't want you to know about me... ...is... My God. Have you got a light? Can't believe your story is crazier than mine. You gonna write about this? If you're lucky. If I'm lucky. If you're lucky! God damn right, I will. I wish... I hadn't pushed you away. I wish I hadn't been so hard on you. I have so many regrets. I blame myself for pushing you into his arms. You were the only family I had. Now you are gone. Please forgive me for not being there for you, babygirl. Well done, Willie! Honestly, congratulations. - That was absolutely beautiful. - Thank you. Full of truth, and honesty. A real breakthrough. I'm very proud of you, Willie. Well done. Well done, Seraphina. - Thank you very much! - Congratulations. With re-enactments we learn to see ourselves through our own eyes. So we can begin again. I have borderline personality disorder, and I don't even know how much longer I have to live. I'm an actress. An influencer... You're a disgrace to this family. Mark, I told you. We talked about this. You can use the voice. Yeah, I don't wanna do that anymore 'cause of how it feels. I give you permission to use the accent, okay? Fine, fine. I'm an actress, a comedian, an influencer, a humanitarian. I am a lover of animals... You're a disgrace to this family. I know I am, Dad, but you just have to fucking deal with it! Great energy. You may exit that way. Just be careful, Mark. Yeah. Do you ever think about me? All those years. I feel like such a fool. You think I ask too little of myself, I know. But there was never any room for my dreams. It was always about you. Now I can see you're a coward. A mean, old man! Yes! You... are the best investment. Next up, we have a truly brave, young woman. Who's made a massive breakthrough this week. Nadia, why don't you come up on stage? Remember, guys. As I said, this is just the beginning. So you should all be full time members of the Brooklyn Studio, okay? All right, Nadia. Okay, in your own time. Try not to think about it too much. Just... be. Why did you choose me? Because we love each other. But I was eight years old. And you bought me. If you loved me, you never would've done the things that you did to me. Don't listen to their lies, Nadia. They will never understand our love. I'm only now just starting to process the damage that you've done to me. You completely robbed me of my childhood. - I just wanna be fucking normal. - You enjoyed it. Okay? And you know you did. Your family never complained. Huh? The houses? The trips abroad? - We love each other, Nadia. - No, I fucking don't. You fucking animal. I fucking hate you! - We love each other. - Get the fuck away from me. Why don't you come and sit over here next to me, Nadia? It's been a very long day. - You like it, don't you? - Get the fuck... Jesus Christ. Stop it! Oh, my God! Just take deep breaths. Hey! Where are you going? I'm gonna go get a first aid kit. - Don't panic. - Are you kidding me? Call 911! Can you stop doing that right now, please? Leave us a message. Hey, David. It's Declan. Hope you're well, buddy. Yeah, listen. I had a few friends up on the farm this weekend and there was... a little bit of an accident. Ha! Never a dull moment. But I just wanted to let you know that I'm doing things this weekend, and you know, if you... if you get a call, just go ahead and let them know that I had... permission to be here. All right? Let's grab drinks in the city soon. On me, obviously. Lots of great stuff happening. Okay, talk soon. Bye. Fuck! Hey! It's okay. I'll take care of this. You should go. You should go. I got this. Drive! If you want a happy ending, it depends on where you stop the story. Is this your tell-all? I wanted to be honest about my whole journey, and that involves this place and us. Didn't leave anything out, did you? I'm not, I'm not doing this for dramatic effect, but I need to pee. Be right back. Okay. So the angle is beware of false prophets, right? But even though the retreat was a total disaster, I still... ended up having to confront my past so I could actually move forward with my life. You know I would put a bow on this, right? The story ends... when the girl gets her shit together. She gets her old job back, and she tells us all about it from the cover of Rogue Journal. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. This is the most honest and vulnerable thing that I've read in a long time. The Shuroo Process. "If hipster gurus didn't exist, would we have to create them?" "Musings from a millennial meltdown"? This is perfect! Thank you. You gotta see this! Our next guest has been called the... - Oh, my God. - ...college professor, the high priest to the hipster community of self-help. The Sham Shaman. And my favorite, The Voodoo Guru. But really, what can I call ya? You can call me Shuroo, Tom. Not Declan? Declan no longer exists, Tom. Okay, well, may he rest in peace. But, just to be clear, you had no direct permission to use the property of the Catskills? There was a misunderstanding. It was a misunderstanding? What about the two ex-cons that were found along... Wait a minute. We have, right here, a photograph of the two that you were keeping company with. They're... It's not somebody you would invite to a party, is it? Look, the stabbing incident that you're referring to was a mere flesh wound. The man in question - has never been doing better. - Well, that's good. In fact, I think it was the making of him. I mean... ...and these two ex-cons, that I was paying to rent the property from, - by the way. - You did illegally administer drugs to people on the property. That's a fact, right? Semantics. And frankly, I don't know whether I like these "gotcha" questions, Tom. It's a little bit below you. I don't know. I have... taken care of all of my legal liabilities, and now I'm just ready to move on. Everybody that was on that weekend is flourishing. So, have you seen Miss Schafer lately? Look, I had genuine feelings for Parker. I did. But I feel like she seduced me, all the while promising a piece in her sad, little magazine, and I fell for it. You feel like you've been used? You know, I do. I do, in fact. I feel like Parker used me for sex, and other things. You know, I'm in a really good place now. - Oh, my God. - I'm sure you're glad... - He's so sexy. - ...that's a turtleneck... - I'd love to sit on his face. - ...and not a priest collar. I am no messiah. I never said I was. All right? I'm just a guy out there trying to help people. What's coming up for you? What you got next? Well, Tom, I'm excited to share with you a first look at my new docuseries, The Shuroo Process. A World Awakens. On the premier episode of A World Awakens, we visit the home of Hollywood superstar, Eric Roberts, to see how the Shuroo Process has saved his life from addiction. Are you shitting me? - You fucked him? - Shit. Why wouldn't you... How do you even leave that out? I was embarrassed. I didn't want it to overshadow the story. I thought you were here to bare your soul? I did. I just... I don't know. I... Were you in love with him? Fuck it. Let him have his 15 minutes. Maybe some of these housewives who watch the show will buy the magazine. You know, I tell you, I'm going to own it. Let's call Oprah. I'll do every interview imaginable. - Why not, right? - Exactly. - Thank you. - It's only getting weirder. Everything in life is writable if you have the outgoing guts to do it. The worst enemy of creativity? I'll take all of them. Self-doubt.
