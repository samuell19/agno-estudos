Two outs already. WHITE TIGERS SHIMONOSEKI BELLO A Come on! Last pitch. Right in the center. Play! Are you okay, Seiha? Does it hurt anywhere? You feel sick? Seiha, we're nearly there. Hold on, okay? Takumi, close your window. Seiha could catch a cold. Takumi! It feels nicer with the breeze. Seiha, Grandpa's house is over there. Wow! I can see it. Brother, it's over there. Takumi, that's where our new life begins. Come see. The air is so good. Seiha… - Feel better now? - Yeah. - Your throat's not sore? - Yeah. Has that always been there? Of course. That's Grandma. How nostalgic. This is still here? This used to be my room, you know. Our stuff arrives tomorrow, so tidy up today, okay? Got it? Seiha! Where are you? It's time for your medicine. Never heated a bath like this, right? I really appreciate you letting us move in. No need to be so formal. Anyway, it's good you could move during spring vacation. Yes. Takumi. Say hello to Grandpa, Takumi. If you want to go for a run, go up to Nitta Shrine. Grandpa. Yes? Teach me the curveball. Not yet. You're not ready. Takumi… Please excuse his attitude. It's just the way he is. Nice pitch! You're Harada Takumi of the White Tigers, right? I watched all your games… right up to the finals. We were in that tournament, too. Though we lost our second game… I've been a fan of yours ever since, Harada Takumi. Oh, I'm… I'm Nitta Stars' cleanup hitter Nagakura Go, the catcher. The catcher! Want me to pitch? Huh? If you can catch my pitches, that is… Great. Then I'll come help you move in tomorrow. Let's do it after that. Seems your Mom and mine are friends from childhood. Maybe it's a lucky sign. A lucky sign! Take this. No, thanks. Take it anyway. See you then. Go… Why did you give him the fishes? It's fine. It's been a while since we got a fish that big. We can always get more. Harada Takumi… Seiha. Coach! Sorry for being late. Sorry, Inamura, to trouble you on your day off. Hey, Inamura. Hello. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Oh, the famous catcher. No… Mom. Five more seconds. Four, three, two, done. Let's see. Huh? See? I told you I don't have a fever. We have to be vigilant. Seiha, don't get overexcited. There! Hello there. Hello. What's your name? Harada Seiha. How cute. I'm Nagakura Go. - How old are you? - Nine. My Go was the cutest at Seiha's age. You did well to convince Go to quit baseball at elementary school. I can't see Takumi doing that. He played on the condition that he give up before junior high. He is Nagakura Hospital's heir. You're right. They can't play baseball forever. Maki, your accent came back at last. You're right. It's been so long. I'm surprised I still remember. - Don't you forget it. - What a surprise. Was that Takumi? Jeez. He's so unsociable. Seiha. Hey, Go. What does this fish eat? It's very fierce. So… bugs, worms, or frogs. Sometimes humans. What? Really? Just kidding. Let's do it. I'm ready. Come on! That's… That's incredible… How long did it take your catcher to catch these? Just over six months. I bet. Come on, then. Wow. It's like it's got a life of its own. Catch it properly. A runner could steal a base. You'll let 'em get that far? Almost… I did it! Harada, give me more. More! I'll get them all. Come on. Time out! Oh… Sorry, Takumi and Go. Inamura from my company wants a go. How about it? Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you guys but… Watching you… it was so tempting. Mind if I take a swing? Not at all. He was in the last team your grandpa took to Koshien. The cleanup hitter at Koshien! So what? So… Let's strike him out. Of course. Got it. Strike one! Nice ball! You can just feel its power. I can't believe he's in junior high… Inamura. Yes? They both start junior high next week. What? What? Got it. Strike two. Go Koshien finalist! Go Takumi! Wait. Time out. Hey, mister… What is it? The next one will be… right in the center. Come on. Got it! Strike three! - Batter out! - Yes! Great! Nice ball! We did it. Hey, Inamura… You figured they were just kids and that was your mistake. Go… What are you doing? It's time for your cram school. Mom, why are you here? Why? I got a call from the cram school's teacher. Okay… Okay, just wait! Okay, wait! Seiha, you mustn't be out dressed like this. Okay! Okay, I know. Just wait a bit. Sorry Harada, I have to go to cram school. You passed. You, too. You got an amazing arm. Will you pitch to me tomorrow? Until I decide whether to keep on playing baseball? I want to catch your throws every day. Sure. Looks like it's done. Eat up your veggies too. How's Seiha? Better? The medicine's finally working. His fever's down and he's half asleep. Listen, Takumi. I told you countless times. Don't show off to your brother. Seiha's weak. Baseball's out of the question. How could you show it off to him? You're his big brother! - Makiko. - You too, Dad. I was wondering where you were. You're still not over baseball? - Makiko! - You too! Yes. We moved here for Seiha's health. That's what we all decided. But from day one, it's been baseball, baseball, baseball… Hiroshi. Yes. Seiha's quite impressive. Yes. In what way? Today… his eyes were sparkling. Those are the kids with promise. Maybe I spoke out of turn. Anyway, let's drink. My name's Harada Seiha. Nice to meet you. Let's start! Cheers! I'm leadoff hitter, Sawaguchi Fumito. All-round player of Nitta Stars. Call me "Sawa." Sawa's family runs the temple. They run the temple! His dad's a monk, but he's scared of ghosts! Higashi! They'll come if you say that! I'm Nitta Stars' third baseman, Higashitani Keita. My family runs Tenma Sushi. You're welcome to come any time. Higashi's always promoting the family business. He has a knack for it. He has a knack for it. Hey. What does your dad do, Harada? He moves around a lot. My brother was born in Tokyo, but I was born in Hiroshima. That's why you got an accent. Yeah. Is this it? The Nitta Stars? I… I tried to gather all the guys to welcome you. But most have quit baseball when we left elementary school. How about you? One, two, three, four! Five, six, seven, eight! Okay, let's practice. To your positions, Ryota, Masaharu! Ryota, Masaharu, do your best! Seiha, here! What? Don't, Go. He'll get a fever. Seiha, it's fine. Get out there! Okay! Don't run, Seiha! Come back! It's fine, go. - Go for it, Seiha! - Seiha! It's no fun just watching. With your pitch, it'll never reach the outfield anyway. Come on, Harada! Strike. Sawa, struck out. - Okay, nice pitch! - Damn. Give me another chance, Harada! You struck out! Strike two. What's up, Higashi? Last chance. Nice pitch. Is Tenma Sushi closing? Hit it properly, Kappa! Shut up. This one's for the pride of Nitta Stars' third batter. Nice ball. Kappa strikes out. - It's so fast. - Okay, nice pitch! - Hey! - Come on, Kappa! At last, the fourth batter, Nagakura Go's turn. Come on, Go! You should stick to catching. Sit down. What's with that attitude? Higashi. No way… We got to show him what the Nitta Stars is made of. Thank you. Come on. I challenge you, Harada Takumi. What are you doing? I'm fine here. Come on, then! Whoa… Whoa! Strike one, then. Come on! Seiha. - Seiha! - A hit! Seiha! - He got it! - He got it? I got it! He did! Nice, Seiha! You did it! - Nice catch. - A fine play. Go, can I keep this ball? Of course. Your first commemorative baseball! - Yay! - Good for you. He's got promise, huh? Don't touch my shoulder. Oh, sorry. Is that your mom again? Cram school. You need a phone to play ball? I'm sorry. What, did the ringtone distract you? Harada's pretty sensitive, huh? Sorry. Hyottoko. - Kappa. - This one! Why do you treasure it so much? You wouldn't understand. I'm definitely going to play baseball. Just like you. Takumi. That's right, I wanted Go to hear it from you that he hasn't got the talent for baseball and to give up. To be blunt, this is your doing, Takumi. Go was going to quit baseball, but now he wants to keep it up. We let him play baseball until he entered junior high. But that boy… Ma'am. Baseball isn't something you let us do, it's something we do. Seiha, let's go. Okay. Seiha just told me he's joining the Nitta Stars. I forbid him but he says it's none of my business. Why did you let him play baseball? You were rude to Setsuko… Go's mom, right? Who do you think you are? Never touch a pitcher's shoulder. I'm home. What's going on? I spoke out of turn again. BASEBALL LESSON 1 INTRODUCTION TO BASEBALL Hey. Why… Brother, I played catch with Dad this morning. Grandpa said I'm pretty good, too. What's wrong? Baseball isn't for a weakling like you. That's not true. Give it back. Give me my ball back. There's no way. There's no point in this. My ball… Takumi! That's Seiha's keepsake! Let's practice. Takumi! How could you be so cruel? I don't get you sometimes. Forget it. You got no power. These aren't Harada Takumi's pitches. Liar. It's true. Your pitches today aren't as fast as you think they are. Hey! You left us out! I won't let you have our sushi anymore! That's right, you were left out! Practice's over already. What? Really? You're really going to keep playing baseball in junior high? Yeah. I'm surprised your mom agreed. She said… baseball isn't something she lets me do. Fine words. Then let's all sign up on Monday. Yeah. Yay! Takumi! Isn't Seiha with you? What? He's not home yet. Takumi! Higashi! Takumi? The forest behind this shrine is really thick. Even the locals avoid it at night. This way! Seiha! Seiha! Are you okay? He'd never be here. No way. Why not? Seiha… He's a scaredy-cat. No way he's here. Takumi. You ever given up hits in a row? You've never had the bases loaded with no outs, right? No. I bet you're weak under pressure. Seiha, you idiot. Answer if you're here! Brother? Seiha. Over there. Takumi! Takumi! You okay, Takumi? Here. Are you okay, Takumi? Brother?! Seiha, don't move! I'm coming! Seiha! Seiha! Seiha! Seiha! Brother? It's all right, Seiha. I found the ball. That's good, Seiha. Yeah! Why did you bring manga? Do you even want to study? And what's these bangs, huh? Why are they so long? Have you looked in a mirror? Hey you, get in line. DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE Button up your jacket. Disciplinary committee's orders. Empty your pockets. Hurry, show me! Show me! Right now. What the hell? How dare you. Hey! Stop it. Both of you, stop. You, huh? Harada. What are you doing? Come with me. Why not empty your pockets? Cigarettes? Booze? Or is it a switchblade? Mr. Tomura. You mustn't…! BASEBALL CLUB APPLICATION FORM I run the baseball club. Anything you want to say? Please give me my ball back. Playthings aren't allowed. Baseball isn't play. You're a pitcher. A good fastball but no curveball yet. You run five to six kilometers daily, and you frequently stretch and exercise. You're qualified. So… Anything else you'd like to add? Please give me my ball back. Harada. That's no way to talk to Mr. Tomura. Apologize. Harada. I'm glad. Are you hurt? Otomurai, right? I was worried. Otomurai? Mr. Tomura. It's Tomura, so Otomurai. He once yelled at a kid who then had a heart attack and died. They say his ghost haunts the storage room. Hey, get into your seats before the bell. Sawaguchi! Who's on duty today? Mr. Kusanagi. Yes? Please let me quit the disciplinary committee. What? The committee had my friend in tears this morning. That wasn't right. I don't want any part of it. Yajima, you're not a little kid. Don't be so selfish. But… Why was I summoned to the faculty room? Well… You weren't punished, huh? Thanks to Mr. Tomura's kindness. Be grateful! If he decides everything, why the need for regulations and a disciplinary committee? Harada, it's fine. Stand by your beliefs. I think giving up half-way is really the worst. Hey, Harada. Do you think Yajima's cute? She was in tears. Harada, what do girls think of me and my shaved head? Jeez. I wonder what girls think… Move! Oh. Sorry. Hello! Gather around! Hello, Sir! Hello, Sir! Second and third years concentrate on infield defense. Sir! And Harada, show me your pitch. Aren't you going to answer?! Sir. Nobunishi, you catch. Sir. Throw, then. What? Awesome… He'll never catch it. Yeah… Nobunishi! Are you okay? It's got speed, but no control, Coach. I was testing to see if he was really trying to catch it. Takumi! If you want to see my pitch, please have Nagakura catch. What? Come on! Nice ball! One more! Nice! He'll make the team for sure. We better shape up. - One more. - That's enough. I get the picture. Harada. Shave your head by tomorrow, okay? Will that make me pitch faster? If you can't do as I say, leave the club. Your pitches aren't so good that I have to beg. Hey, Captain. Sir. Second and third years on defense. I'll bunt. First years to the outfield. Let's go! About inspection at the school gates… I thought in our class, we could make it voluntary. Harada, what do you think? Me? You were the one who said I should stand by my beliefs, right? I realized I've been giving up constantly for the last 12 years. Even my name, Yajima Mayu. My parents wished for me to emerge as a pretty butterfly. But that's a chrysalis, not a cocoon. Know what comes out of a cocoon? It's a moth. A moth! I used to hate my name so much when I was little. If I'll only ever be a moth, what's the point in caring? Then one day, a friend showed me a real cocoon. It was so pretty, sparkling in the light… Like fresh snow. You snapping at me made me think. I like my name. So I'm not going to be such a quitter. Sorry, I talked too much. You sure did. I wanted to say that at homeroom, I'm going to suggest my idea. Will you back me up? I'm rallying support. You should be glad you're Yajima Mayu. Why? It's better than Yajima Sanagi. What's with that? I understand how you feel. You can go home, Harada. You said my pitches are not worth begging for, Coach. Yes, I did. So what? Can you even hit my pitches? Play ball. Ball, one. Strike! Ball. That was a very low strike, Nobunishi. Correction. Strike one. Shortstop! First base! Out… Right, Coach? What kind of defense was that?! And you call yourself a captain? I'm sorry! You all practice defense today. - I leave the rest to you, Captain. - Sir. Harada… Harada and Nagakura, you two practice pitching. Sir! Nobunishi. Sir? Order the uniforms. Coach, are you going to field him? That's none of your business. This is a tough one… Long time no see. I played baseball at Nitta when you coached there. Makoto, right? Fifth batter, shortstop, Tomura Makoto. Yes. I now manage the Nitta East Junior High team. Takumi, right? Yes. Your grandson is a remarkable pitcher. But he's got character issues. I was wondering if we can help him together. Takumi's brother… got very ill moments after being born. My wife and I had Takumi with us for a while. Takumi was only three then. He cried, looking for his parents every day. But then… when he got hold of a baseball… everything changed. He stopped crying completely and wouldn't put the ball down. A three-year-old. He was chosen by baseball. Proof of a genius player. To Takumi, baseball is… proof of his loneliness. To him, baseball is full of sorrow. Makoto… Takumi won't get any better. I'm going to try to make him! In high school, we had faith. That you, who regularly got to Koshien, would also guide us there. But you abandoned us. Retiring just before the tournament. A player you abandoned is going to guide your grandson to Koshien. Isn't that funny, Coach? Makoto, to you, baseball is… full of sorrow, huh? Pardon? He didn't abandon you. Seiha… Grandpa quit being a coach because the doctor said Grandma didn't have much long to live. So Grandpa left baseball to spend even just a little bit of time with her. He didn't abandon you, mister. Mister, do you love baseball? Makoto… What is it about baseball? As things stand, Takumi won't improve. No… Maybe baseball may even hurt him. - Daddy? - Yeah? Even Grandpa's wrong sometimes. What about? Why are we on duty today of all days? Is this where that ghost hangs out? What… Don't say things like that. Is it okay if I wait here? What are you guys doing?! Stop! Be quiet! Hold him down. Take what you deserve. You pushed your luck. Don't touch me! Who do you think you are! You idiot! Don't touch me! Takumi, can you hear me? Takumi! Harada? Go, fetch a teacher. You can't. You can't. Where's Sawa? He's not here. Here you go. Thank you, Coach. Makiko, another one! Makiko! Makiko! Bring the whole bottle. Makiko! Bring the whole bottle. - Be quiet and eat. - Sorry. - I'm cleaning up. - Sorry. Here, apples. - I said two dry days a week! - Sorry. Sorry. You, too. Takumi, welcome home. Want dinner? No, I don't. Eat. Before I clear away. Takumi? Makiko, cold sake's fine. Just hurry up. Dad, you've had enough. And you're as bad. - Sorry. - Hurry up and eat, you two. To be… To be… or not to be. or not to be. That is the question. That is the question. To live or to die? That is the question. That's what this means. One day maybe you'll have worries just like Hamlet. Then I hope you'll remember these words. You going to Sawa's house? Harada, do you think Sawa was involved? Hello. Hey, hello. Where's Sawa? Up there. Sawa! What're you doing there? Come down. No. Harada… You're mad at me, right? That's a great tree, Sawa. What can you see up there? Just this coward. Sawa… Did you really… I waited outside the storage room… Suddenly a hand went over my mouth… they told me to keep watch. And to keep my mouth shut. That it'd be a disaster for the club if anyone found out. We're done. Don't tell anyone. Nobunishi and two third years. Got it?! I was worried about you, Harada, but I was so scared… I ran away alone. I abandoned you, Harada. I didn't even call for help. I'm a coward. I'm just as bad as they are! I don't know… I don't know what to do… Let's play baseball, Sawa. What? Come to school tomorrow. I'll protect you from them. Harada… …lost in thought My life goes by As I stare at the rain fall The classics teach us not only grammar but the culture and feelings of people in past times. "When you enter, knock, say 'excuse me, ' ask for your teacher, and leave quietly." Sawauchi? Yajima… Why were you absent the last few days? Is Mr. Tomura in? Mr. Tomura? Wait here. Hey, Sawaguchi. I wonder if Sawa's still up on that tree today. I wonder what he's looking at. Harada! Harada… Just earlier, Sawauchi was here. Sawa?! Looking for Mr. Tomura. But a baseball player in the disciplinary committee dragged him off. Damn! Sawa! Nobunishi! - Sawa! - Sawa! What? You're back for more? We'll happily beat you up again. Hey! You guys. What the hell is this? Nobunishi, Okuhira, Midorikawa! Answer me. Let's just move past this, Coach. We got entrance exams. And you have the team's reputation to consider. Nobunishi, why? You of all people? What? Wow. So even Otomurai doesn't know everything. You punk… Why did you do this?! Why, Nobunishi?! How could you do such a thing?! Mr. Tomura! Are you alright? I'm fine… Oh no… Wait, please, I'm fine… But it's your head. An ambulance, please. Nitta East Junior High, by the storage shed. I never gave a damn about baseball anyway. I just joined the club to make my transcript look good. Clubs, the disciplinary committee, cram school… I got sick of being busy, but I stuck it out. Day after day after day. Harada. If only you'd never showed up. Doing and saying whatever you wanted… Effortlessly making the team. You started this. It's all your fault. It's Harada Takumi's fault! Trouble like this is common enough. But Nobunishi has entrance exams. I can't have this incident bothering the other students. Nobunishi's group will leave the team and that will end the matter. And from now on… The baseball club will close for the time being. Needless to say, this means withdrawing from this year's tournaments. Please wait a minute. The spring tournament, I agree. But the summer one is the last match. Please let the third years take part in that at least. Mr. Tomura, you seem to misunderstand. Misunderstand? Our baseball team doesn't belong to you. All club activities are at the assent of the school board and myself. You would do well to remember it, too. Baseball doesn't belong to you. More! Again? You eat so well recently, Seiha. Baseball gives me an appetite. Really? But don't overdo it. She's right, Seiha. If you stuff yourself, you won't be able to pitch well. I meant baseball. Eat well, Seiha. It's this fresh air that gives us the appetite. More. With pleasure. Okay! Okay! I got it! Hey! Second! Out. So you've been practicing here. You must be pretty upset. Takumi. The principal who's never touched a ball took baseball from us. Frustrating, right? I'm frustrated too. Harada. Think you could strike out Kadowaki, that champ hitter from Yokote? You know them, right? Yokote Junior High placed second in the nationals. The cleanup hitter, Shugo Kadowaki. He set a record with 12 tournament home runs. They call him "The Beast." If that beast strikes out to an unknown first year, I'm sure they'll challenge us. I want that game to be the third years' farewell match in place of the tournament. I'll take full responsibility. I'll put my job on the line. Who does baseball belong to, Coach? You all. He said it! Go. Let's do it! - Let's go! - Let's do it. See, it didn't hurt. But it did, really. I'm not exaggerating. Oh, Harada. Yajima, shouldn't you explain? Shugo's my cousin. Mr. Tomura asked me to set it up. So we, the Tennis Club, are mediating the deal. Mr. Tomura, you owe me one. I'm deeply obliged. That was just a joke! Mayu! I've got your drink. Thanks for waiting. So you're Nitta's problem child who pitches at 500 kmph. And you're his long-suffering wife? Excuse me? Oh, I'm Mizugaki Shunji. Yokote's fifth batter and Shugo's minder. It's not common knowledge but we retired to study for exams. Shall we begin, Shugo? Sir, I'll be umpire. Okay, nice ball! Let's start. Let's get it over with and go home! Play ball. Take it easy. Come on! Yes! Nice one! Nice, Takumi. Shugo. He's the real deal. I've never seen you so rattled. Time out. Time out! Uh-oh, he's getting into gear now. Come on Takumi. Give it all you got! Strike one! Play. Foul! Strike two. Good. Nice pitch. What will you do, Beast? Last chance. Come on, Takumi! Oh, no. Home run?! No, a foul. But he's got his timing right. It was a good hit. Time out, please. Time out. Don't worry, Takumi. Your ball's got wings today. Even Ichiro couldn't hit it. We'll nail him with the next ball. Let's do it. Right in the center, Takumi! Come on! What was that pitch? Looks like we won. It was just one turn at bat. You wouldn't win in a game! Harada, how dare you humiliate Shugo. Sir… We'd like to play your team. Hear that, Harada? We'll bring our best players. And we'll crush you guys. Yes! In a few days… We'll get a challenge from Yokote Junior High. They'll bring their regular championship line-up. I know third years have exams, but I want to field a full team. But of course, you decide. You decide how you want to play it. From here on, I won't get involved. That's all. Come on, everyone! Come on, Takumi! Damn! Sorry. Next! Right on target. Catch it properly! Sorry. I'll get the next one. Out! Out! As expected of Yokote. They have some good members. It's Takumi. Brother! Let's start with that pitch. I'll definitely catch it today. Isn't there a weird vibe coming from those two? Come on! Play! Ball to first! Pitcher! Strike three! - Nice pitch, Harada! - Nice pitching! Harada! Go, go, Harada! Go, go, Harada! Takumi. You won't strike him out with that pitch. We'll overtake them! Grandpa? He seems different today. Really? He looks to be in tip-top shape. Jeez… Yum. Let me hear it! This is really nail-biting stuff. Hello! It sounds different. Huh? That fastball is coming, right? It will. Come on! Play! Left back! Left okay! Loosen up and relax! What's wrong?! Come on! Strike! Damn it. This time… This time for sure. It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry, keep it up. Takumi, give me your best! Damn it! Since when? Since he first pitched against Kadowaki. What is it, Coach? Hmm… His pitch is evolving faster than them. There's also something going on between him and the catcher. No, it's like he's on his own out there. What do you mean by that? This is what I mean. Shugo! Dropped third strike. We can't hit Harada's pitches, but the catcher can't catch them either. Dropped third strike! Dropped third strike…! Time out, please. Time out! I'll catch the next one. I bet my life on it. I promise. I'm your catcher. Trust me, all right? Takumi. Come on, then! Home run! Why, Takumi? Harada! What the hell was that?! Did you hold back because you thought I couldn't catch it? Answer me. That's like a betrayal. Sit down, Go. Takumi! Sit down! You betrayed him first. What? You aren't good enough to be Harada's catcher. If a catcher can't catch every ball, the pitcher's hands are tied. Like a dragonfly without wings. That fifth batter… he's completely crushed them. Crushed what? Go, which also means Takumi, too. The battery itself. Play! Balk! Let's go! Let's crush them, just like this. What's wrong Harada? Still no outs! Nice batting! Hey, what the hell are you doing?! Coach! Oh! Excuse me. Kadowaki! Mizugaki! Who gave permission for this game? Mr. Ato, I did. I gave them permission. Mr. Tomura. I don't recall allowing this game! And most of them are third years. They should be studying for exams. This is inexcusable! Coach, we're just having some fun. Having fun in Yokote's uniforms, Mizugaki? You Nitta boys think this is some fun? No, we don't. Kadowaki… Especially you… You have a sports scholarship, you shouldn't be out here! But you wrong the school like this. I'll decline the scholarship and drop a year. What… What are you… I'm under Harada Takumi's spell, Coach. I can't quit baseball without getting to hit that ball! Harada! Nagakura! You got that?! This isn't over! Kadowaki! How dare you hold back on me?! You made a fool of me today. Say something, Takumi. Fight me! If you won't trust me, I won't trust you either. That's the end of this battery. It ends today! What? Go, your food's ready! Go? One, two… I wonder what happened to Harada and Go. Oh, hello. Takumi? Takumi! Sawa, why did you want to see us without Go? I was thinking of becoming Harada's catcher. What are you talking about? The rematch is in two days. That's why. You don't have to pitch full power. We can win even if you dial it down to 70 percent. That should be plenty for you to put up a fight. Let's practice now. Two full days of practice should do it. You can't do that behind Go's back! You wanna play so bad you'd even push Go off the team? I just want to play ball. I don't want their squabble to drag us down with them. Come on, Harada! You can throw harder! But your limit is 70 percent! Come on, right in the center. Okay, Nice catch. See, I ain't that bad. No sweat. In the center. Again! No worries… You being Harada's catcher… This isn't right! Sawa. Shouldn't you be running to Go instead of Higashi? I really believed you'd go talk to him. But… Why can't you go talk to him? Like you did with me, inviting me to play… Why can't you?! What's up, Seiha? What do you want? Go! Seiha… Go! What's wrong? Go! Hey, Go! Higashi? Are you fine with Sawa taking your place?! You're the catcher! You don't mind Sawa taking Harada?! What do you play baseball for? You used to give it everything. Shutting out your opponent, dictating the play. And now look at you, prepared to pitch at 70 percent. I just don't get it! What is baseball to you?! Answer me. Answer me, Harada! What does baseball mean to… As if I could catch that! I quit after all! You're so lame, Sawa. Quiet! First and foremost… I'm a first baseman. How are you an all-rounder? Go memorize some prayers. Shut up, Tenma Sushi! Go eat some kappa maki! Hey! Let's play a small game! What? I'll pitch and Go can catch. Okay. You'll play too, right? You promised to play with me. Okay! Let's play! Okay, let's do it! Let's do it! Seiha, hold the center of the ball and throw. Okay! Come on! Takumi, to home base. Out! Nice throw! That was awesome! That was like a laser beam. In just five throws, you managed to catch my pitches. When we first played catch. It sent a shiver down my spine. I had found a great catcher. I thought, "I can't let this guy go." It wasn't your fault Kadowaki hit a home run. You said you saw it, right? The elementary-school Chugoku tournament. Final game, bottom of the 9th inning… Two outs and a runner on third… I was confident I could shut them out. I threw the best pitch ever, gave it everything I had. Since that day, I've been scared of pitching. Until I met you. I've been scared all this time. That day, it all came back. I suddenly got worried. You looked worried, too. Which made me feel more scared. That's why that last pitch to Kadowaki felt so weak. But next time, I won't be scared. I'll never betray you. Just pitch, Takumi. Just pitch. Enough chatting, just pitch. I'll catch them all. So… just pitch. Come on! Almost. Nice pitch, though. Damn it. Hey… All right! It's got power. Nice catch. Great pitch. You're doing good today. Gimme another. Right in the center, come on. Okay, got it. I'm home. Welcome home. Is it Seiha? Takumi… How is he? No change. It's your fault. How many times did I tell you? Letting Seiha play baseball… If anything happens to him… Makiko. Stay away. Get out. My specialty curry. Eat up. You can't fight on an empty stomach. Tomorrow's the big game with Yokote, right? I'll be there, Takumi. The Harada Takumi and… Kadowaki Shugo showdown. I can't miss it. Why are you so hard on Takumi? I guess I am taking it out on him… But… What? Compared to Seiha, he's so strong… When I see Takumi doing whatever he wants… It makes me mad. Your father said… To Takumi, baseball is proof of his loneliness. It's tragic and sorrowful, too. That was pretty hard to hear as a parent. But I think there's more to it. To Takumi, baseball… is a kind of prayer. A prayer? Having a sickly baby brother, a brother who's always being rushed to hospitals like this, a brother who not even be with us for long. Darling… I think Takumi devotes himself to it because it's Seiha's beloved sport. To tell the truth, I joined the baseball team at work. Harada Hiroshi, no. 8, right field. It's the first time I've ever played. I discovered it's a sport that brings out your feelings. Feelings? You share your feelings and read those of your teammates. When you can do that while playing, it's really, really fun. I truly want to share this with Takumi. And tell him that it's okay to enjoy it. You want to get through to him, too, right? To say it's not just Seiha that you love… That he's precious, too. Let me hear it in your voices! Get in line! Line up! Let's begin. Let's do this! Why isn't Harada here? He'll come. Takumi will be here for sure. Let's do our best, everyone! Brother… There are times… when I think I might die… The fever makes my body feel so light… like I'm becoming invisible… gradually disappearing… Is that what it feels like to die? But you know… the sound of you getting ready to play baseball… always brings me back. I heard it just now, too. You have a game today? Brother… Will you pitch? Will you keep pitching… all by yourself? Yeah. Will you… keep pitching… to the very end? Yeah. I'll pitch. You have to win. Seiha. Don't worry! One more try. Let's hear your voices! - Give it your all! - Play! - Time out please! - Time out! Time out! Takumi. Pitcher change. Harada Takumi. We're counting on you. Takumi, give me all you got. Right here! - Nice ball! - Strike! It's faster than before. Wow… Great, Takumi. Nice ball. Gimme another one! Takumi! What? Go! Go! Takumi! Fight! Fight! Takumi! Your brother… he's on the mound, Seiha. Mom's there, too. She went to support him. Isn't baseball amazing? Keep up the fight, Seiha. Go… Go… Seiha… Takumi, right in the center, come on! Strike! Out! I'm gonna throw now! Subtitle translation by Kennedy Taylor
