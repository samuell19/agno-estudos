(chisel hitting stone) Woman: THE BAD DREAMS ALWAYS COME BACK AGAIN, LIKE UNWANTED FRIENDS... AND LAST NIGHT I FOUND MYSELF IN LIMMERIDGE CHURCHYARD. NORMALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD STAY DEAD JUST AS NORMALLY IT IS THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE LOCKED UP RATHER THAN THE VICTIMS. BUT THEN... THERE WAS NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US... EXCEPT PERHAPS THE BEGINNING... THAT SUMMER'S DAY ON LIMMERIDGE LAWN WHERE WE WITNESSED THE FATE OF POOR LAURA'S CROQUET BALL... (train whistle blows) AND THAT NIGHT, THE ARRIVAL OF A TUTOR TO TEACH US DRAWING. (owl screeching) YOU DON'T SUSPECT ME OF WRONG, DO YOU, SIR? WHY DO YOU SUSPECT ME OF WRONG? I SUSPECT YOU OF NO WRONG. I HID... TO WATCH YOU PASS. DO YOU STAY HERE? YES, I HAVE BEEN OFFERED A POST. OH, HOW HAPPY YOU MUST BE. WHERE DO YOU STAY? NOT HERE... BUT THERE AND EVERYWHERE. TOWNS. I DO WHAT I'M TOLD, SIR. DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME, SIR, WHAT TO DO? WHY? WHO ARE YOU? I'M NOT MEANT TO BE HERE. THEY DO NOT WANT ME HERE. DO YOU KNOW A BARONET, SIR? NO. PERHAPS I CAN TRUST YOU. (carriage approaching) MR. HARTRIGHT? Man (continues): YOU SAW A WOMAN FROM THE VILLAGE, PROBABLY. I CAN ASSURE YOU, AS FAMILY LAWYER THAT IT'S NOT OUR NORMAL PRACTICE TO MAKE OUR GUESTS WALK BUT IT SEEMS THE ENGINE ON THE BRANCH LINE BROKE DOWN NEAR CARLISLE. YOUR CHARGES, MARIAN AND LAURA, HAVE NATURALLY RETIRED AND YOUR EMPLOYER, MR. FAIRLIE IS A MAN OF IDIOSYNCRATIC NATURE. HE KEEPS TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS. TO BE FRANK, I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FAILURE TO ARRANGE A PROPER CHAPERON. AH, YOU SHOULD NOT WORRY YOURSELF, MR. GILMORE. I AM TOLD MY SITUATION IN LIFE ACTS AS A GUARANTEE OF ITS OWN. MY LAST EMPLOYER EVEN COMPARED MY PRESENCE UNDER HIS ROOF TO THAT OF A HARMLESS DOMESTIC ANIMAL. MR. FAIRLIE? I AM MR. HARTRIGHT. MR. HARTRIGHT, SIT DOWN, SLOWLY WITHOUT TROUBLING YOURSELF TO MOVE THE CHAIR OR OTHER OBJECTS. IN THE WRETCHED STATE OF MY NERVES MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND IS EXQUISITELY PAINFUL TO ME. SO GLAD TO POSSESS YOU AT LIMMERIDGE. YOU HAVE SEEN YOUR STUDIO. WILL IT DO? (excitedly): WILL IT DO? I CAN ASSURE YOU... NO, MR. HARTRIGHT, A LOWER KEY, PLEASE. YOU SEE, LOUD SOUND IS TORTURE TO ME. YOU WILL PARDON AN INVALID, I'M SURE IF THE LAMENTABLE STATE OF MY HEALTH DICTATES A CERTAIN CODE. BUT AT LEAST YOU WILL FIND YOUR POSITION HERE AS ARTIST AND TEACHER TO MY NIECES PROPERLY RECOGNIZED, MR. HARTRIGHT. THERE IS IN THIS HOUSE NONE OF THE HORRID BARBARITY OF THE LOCAL GENTRY WHO WOULD TREAT ARTISTS AS THEIR SERVANTS. NOW, WOULD YOU PUT THIS TRAY OF COINS BACK IN THE CABINET? (sprays atomizer) AND THEN GO AND TAKE DOWN THAT PORTFOLIO. ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH? YES? OH, HOW NICE TO BE SO STRONG. DON'T DROP IT! YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF THE TORTURES I SHOULD MR. HARTRIGHT IF YOU DROPPED THIS PORTFOLIO. NOW, BEFORE I CONTINUE HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO ASK ME? JUST TSTION OF MY EMPLOYMENT HERE. DO YOU MIND MY CLOSING MY EYES WHILE YOU SPEAK? I FIND IT MUCH EASIER. YES? THE TUITION OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES? OH, THAT. I WISH I FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO GO INTO THAT, BUT I DON'T. MY NIECES, WHO PROFIT BY YOUR KIND SERVICES, MR. HARTRIGHT MUST SETTLE AND AGREE ON YOUR WISHES PROVIDED YOU DEAL WITH THE MORE SUITABLE SUBJECTS-- THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF LANDSCAPE-- FRITH, LANDSEER AND SO FORTH. MR. HARTRIGHT. I AM SORRY IF YOU CAUGHT ME OBSERVING YOUR ARRIVAL. MY SISTER AND I ARE SO FOND OF GOTHIC NOVELS THAT WE SOMETIMES ACT AS IF WE WERE IN THEM. YOU WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE PERFECT SETTING FOR YOUR PRETENSE. MY UNCLE IS NOT THE EASIEST OF MEN TO ENCOUNTER UNBREAKFASTED. I AM SORRY. NO, NO. HE WAS PERFECTLY COURTEOUS. WILL YOUR SISTER BE JOINING US? NO. SHE THOUGHT IT BEST THAT I MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE FIRST. I WILL NOT DISGUISE FROM YOU, MR. HARTRIGHT THAT WE ARE A LITTLE UNUSED TO MALE COMPANY. THAT IS COMMON ENOUGH IN MY PUPILS, MISS FAIRLIE BUT CAN I HOPE YOU AND YOUR SISTER WILL AGREE ON A COURSE OF STUDY? AGREE? I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT LAURA AND MYSELF. YOU WILL NOTICE PRESENTLY THAT WE ARE NOT ALIKE. HAVING DIFFERENT MOTHERS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING BUT IT GOES FURTHER. SHE IS QUIET AND I TALK. SHE INHERITED GREAT WEALTH THROUGH HER MOTHER SHE IS SWEET-TEMPERED AND I AM CRABBED. AND SHE HAS A HIGH OPINION OF MEN, WHILE I... TO SPEAK PLAINLY, MR. HARTRIGHT SHE IS AN ANGEL AND I'M... WELL, PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER PASS THE MARMALADE AND FINISH THE SENTENCE FOR YOURSELF. ONLY BY SAYING THAT YOU SEEM TO REQUIRE SEPARATE TUTORS. SEPARATE? NO! LAURA AND I MAY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON BUT WE WILL NOT BE SEPARATED, AND WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING. YOU MUST PLEASE BOTH OF US, MR. HARTRIGHT OR PLEASE NEITHER OF US. IT'S UNACCOUNTABLE, BUT THERE IT IS. AND I'M SURE WE CAN AGREE ON WHATEVER COURSE OF STUDY YOU PROPOSE. LAURA. MISS FAIRLIE? FORGIVE ME-- JUST FOR ONE MOMENT YOU REMINDED ME OF SOMEONE I MET ON THE ROAD LAST NIGHT BUT I SEE NOW IT IS SOMEONE I MEONLY A RESEMBLANCE NIGHT NOTHING MORE. BUT WHO WAS IT, MR. HARTRIGHT? I DO NOT KNOW. SHE WAS DRESSED ALL IN WHITE. A GHOST, PERHAPS? YES... LET US MAKE A START. IT IS MY INTENTION TO BEGIN WITH THE MOST BASIC PRINCIPLES OF STILL LIFE AND LANDSCAPE. I'M SURE YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE WORK OF LANDSEER. Laura: BUT, MARIAN, WE DO NOT YET KNOW HIM. WHAT IS THERE TO KNOW, LAURA? MR. HARTRIGHT'S LESSONS ARE AS CAUTIOUS AS HIS MANNER AND HE IS SO UNINTERESTED IN US I SOMETIMES THINK HE IS HALF ASLEEP. (giggles) YOU ARE TOO HARSH ON MEN. BUT IF ONLY FATHER WAS HERE NOW. HE COULD HAVE HELPED US WITH SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, PERCIVAL HAS NOT WRITTEN. PERHAPS HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND. LAURA, HE WROTE TWO DAYS AGO. IT IS LESS THAN A WEEK SINCE THE LUNCH. WHY IN HEAVEN SHOULD YOU WORRY? YOUSAY THAT. AND WHY NOT? MARIAN! I KNOW. FOR WEEKS NOW YOU'VE HAD SOME... I CAN'T SAY... SOME CONCERN FOR WEEKS NOW YOU'VE HAD SOME... ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHY DENY IT? LAURA, I HAVE NO WORRIES AND NOR SHOULD YOU. A CHANGE IS COMING AND I'M A COWARD . THAT IS ALL. MR. HARTRIGHT? ARE YOU STILL WORKING? BUT THIS IS MY UNCLE'S COLLECTION. WHAT HAS HE ASKED YOU TO DO? UH, SOME REPAIRS. HE WANTS THEM COMPLETED BY TOMORROW. TOMORROW? BUT THERE WAS MONTHS OF WORK HERE. HE HAD NO RIGHT TO ASK YOU. WILL YOU ACCEPT AN APOLOGY NOT MERELY ON BEHALF OF MY UNCLE BUT OURSELVES? THE TRUTH IS WE THOUGHT YOU QUITE CIRCUMSPECT. WHEN A MAN HAS URGENT NEED OF A JOB MISS FAIRLIE, I FEAR HE GENERALLY IS. BUT WHAT ARE THOSE? OH, JUST SOME MATERIALS I WAS USING FOR MOUNTS. ROSSETTI. WHISTLER. YES, THESE ARE COPIES I MADE. THIS WAS ROSSETTI'S WIFE,T? ELIZABETH. HE DID IT AFTER HER DEATH. (sighs) LOOK AT THE LINE OF THE FACE... SO MUCH LONGING. DID YOU KNOW HE DUG UP HER GRAVE? YES... WHERE HE HAD BURIED HIS POEMS. THIS PICTURE ALWAYS HAUNTED ME... SUCH A TERRIBLE FEELING OF LOSS. (screaming): NO! IT IS THE SAME WOMAN I SAW. I WILL GO DOWN. (woman moaning mournfully) AND THEN THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HER. IT WAS RIGHT HERE. BUT IT WAS NOT A GHOST. IT WAS A WOMAN. MR. GILMORE SAID SHE MUST BE FROM THE VILLAGE. SHE MUST BE FROM THE VILLAGE.O? IF WE COULD JUST HAVE SEEN HER MORE CLEARLY. WELL, THERE IS ONE WAY. DO NOT MOVE. STAND STILL. YES, INDEED, THERE IS SOME RESEMBLANCE ESPECIALLY IN THE COLORING. MISS FAIRLIE, IF YOU WILL JUST LET YOUR ARMS HANG. OH, I CANNOT. NO... JUST SO. (both laugh) IF YOU RELAX YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT SUBJECT. MISS FAIRLIE, PERHAPS IF I MAKE SOME SKETCHES OF YOUR SISTER, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU HOW IT WAS. ASSUMING YOUR MODEL IS HAPPY. YES, MARIAN, I'D LOVE TO TRY. Marian: SO TELL ME, MR. HARTRIGHT HOW DO YOUR SOCIETY SUBJECTS STAY STILL? OH, I HELP THEM ALONG WITH GENEROUS PORTIONS OF COMPLIMENTS. RIGHT WITH GENEROUS PORTIONS OF COMPLIMENTS. MR. HART WILL PAY ME NO COMPLIMENTS. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE I KNOW I WILL BELIEVE ALL YOU SAY TO ME. (piano playing) (music continues) (giggling quietly) AH, THERE ARE TOO MANY BUMPS. INDEED, AND WITH ALL THIS JOLTING AND INTERRUPTION WE CAN CONFUSE MR. HARTRIGHT BETWEEN NATURE AS IT IS WHEN HE LOOKS UP... AND NATURE AS IT IS NOT WHEN HE LOOKS AT OUR WORK. (gasps) WHAT WILL YOU DO? WHAT I KNOW IS RIGHT. BEFORE MR. HARTRIGHT CAME I WAS SO SURE OF MY FEELINGS. WHERE WOULD I BE IF I CHANGED NOW? Marian: MR. HARTRIGHT BECAUSE WE GREATLY VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP I FREELYDMIT I DO NOT LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY BUT I THINK I HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR SECRET. THE TRUTH IS, IF SOME ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN FORMED TO LAURA THEN IT IS MY DUTY TO TELL YOU NOW THAT IT CAN GO NO FURTHER. MY SISTER IS ENGAGED WILLINGLY AND HAPPILY, TO BE MARRIED. INDEED, HER FIANCE IS EXPECTED ANY DAY. I SEE WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE. WE'RE UNUSED TO THESE THINGS AND WE HAD NO THOUGHT THEN OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. MISS FAIRLIE, IT WAS IN ANY CASE MADNESS FOR A TUTOR TO ENTERTAIN SUCH HOPES AND I GRATEFULLY ACCEPT THE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP. IN MY DEFENSE, I CAN ONLY SWEAR IT IS THE FIRST TIME A PERSONAL SYMPATHY EVER ENCROACHED IN MY TEACHING. Marian: I CANNOT GET THE SHAPE OF THE CHURCH. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A GOOD LIKENESS OF THIS PLACE. IT IS VERY DEAR TO US. THEN I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW IT. WHOSE IS THE GRAVE? OUR FATHER'S. OH, MARIAN, I MUST GET READY. MAY I FINISH OUR LESSON FOR TODAY, MR. HARTRIGHT? I CAN WALK BACK. Hartright: HER FIANCE? Marian: YES. HE LIVES NEARBY? NO, HE COMES FROM THE SOUTH. SIR PERCIVAL'S FAMILY WERE FRIENDS OF MY FATHER WHO APPROVED THE MATCH BEFORE HE DIED. AS I DO. OF COURSE. HOWEVER, WE DID SPEAK OF YOUR SECRET MR. HARTRIGHT AND NOW I WILL TELL YOU MINE. HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE UNCANNY FEELING WHEN YOU GO INTO A ROOM OR MEET A PERSON OR SEE A PICTURE THAT IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY AND YET YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG? A KIND OF PREMONITION, YOU MEAN? YES. IT IS NO MORE RATIONAL THAN THAT. AND IT CONCERNS LAURA. YET SIR PERCIVAL IS GOOD-LOOKING WEALTHY, AND SHOWS EVERY SIGN OF BEING IN LOVE. BELIEVE ME, I HAVE PUT HIM TO EVERY TEST ANNOT FIND BELIEVE ME, I HAVE PUT HIM TFAULT WITH HIM. C BUT IS IT NOT NATURAL YOU SHOULD FEEL SOME APPREHENSION? YOU AND YOUR SISTER ARE VERY CLOSE AND YOUR LIVING RELATIVES ARE DISTANT. MR. HARTRIGHT, IF I HAD ANY DOUBTS YOU WOULD PUT YOUR OWN FEELINGS ASIDE TO HELP ME YOU HAVE JUST DISPELLED THEM. (playing piano) (melody ends) Marian: YOUR TEA, SIR PERCIVAL. YOU MUST FORGIVE ME, MISS FAIRLIE. I QUITE FORGOT MYSELF. IT IS SO MANY WEEKS SINCE I LAST HEARD HER PLAY. NOT SO MANY. FOUR WEEKS, TWO DAYS AND, UH... SIX HOURS. IT WAS AT A LUNCH PARTY IN THIS VERY ROOM. MR. HARTRIGHT, IF I MAY SAY SO LIMMERIDGE IS INDEED FORTUNATE TO FIND YOU AS A TUTOR. I SAW SOME OF YOUR DRAWINGS AT BURLINGTON HOUSE LAST SUMMER. IT ISDO NOT EXHIBIT MORE O FTEN. YOU ARE VERY KIND, BUT I FEAR IT WILL BE SOME MONTHS BEFORE I HAVE SUITABLE WORK TO SHOW. WELL, I HOPE AFTER LAURA AND I ARE MARRIED YOU WILL REWARD US BY COMING TO STAY AT BLACKWATER ON OCCASIONS AND CONTINUING THE TUITION. AS YOU MAY KNOW IT IS MY GREAT WISH THAT MISS FAIRLIE HERE WILL MAKE OUR HOME HER HOME. I MAY BE A FOOL, MR. HARTRIGHT BUT THANK HEAVEN I'M NOT FOOL ENOUGH TO TRY AND SEPARATE THE INSEPARABLE. MISS FAIRLIE, I'M SORRY IF I STARTLED YOU. I LOVE THIS SPOT. YES, IT HAS MEMORIES. OUR FATHER USED TO COME HERE. HE TAUGHT US TO THROW STONES. I'M PROBABLY BETTER AT IT THAN DRAWING. THEN, WILL YOU TAKE THIS ONE? A BLUE STONE? I'VE HEARD THAT IS LUCKY. SO I AM GLAD TO GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD NOT BE HERE ALONE. PLEASE. IN... IN A FEW WEEKS I WILL BE MARRIED, MR. HARTRIGHT. BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING. I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS SUMMER-- THE DAYS WE HAVE HAD TOGETHER THE TIME I HAVE SPENT WITH YOU. WHEREVER YOU GO, WHATEVER YOU DO I WANT TO WISH YOU HAPPINESS. THEN, NO MATTER IF IT IS WRONG I WILL THINK OF YOU AND I WILL KEEP THIS MEMORY. FOR GOD'S SAKE, PLEASE GO. Gilmore: THE MATTER IS OF SOME DELICACY, MR. FAIRLIE. YOU WOULD OBLIGE ME BY GIVING THAT MAN PERMISSION TO WITHDRAW. MAN? WHAT MAN? YOU PROVOKING OLD GILMORE. WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY MEAN BY CALLING HIM A MAN? HE'S NOTHING OF THE SORT. AT PRESENT HE IS SIMPLY A PORTFOLIO STAND. WHY OBJECT, GILMORE, TO A PORTFOLIO STAND? I DO OBJECT; IT IS IMPORTANT. (sighs) (servant leaves room) SIR PERCIVAL HAS JUST LEFT AND I WANT TO DISCUSS LAURA'S MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT. OH, THE SETTLEMENT. THE TERMS DEMANDED BY HIS LAWYERS SEEM TO BE EXCESSIVE. THERE IS, AFTER ALL A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE INVOLVED. GOOD GILMORE, HOW YOU RECONCILE ONE TO HUMAN NATURE. BUT WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU PROPOSE? THAT EITHER WE RESIST THEIR DEMAND, OR AT THE VERY LEAST BEFORE WE SIGN, MAKE LAURA AND MARIAN ACQUAINTED WITH IT. MAKE THEM ACQUAINTED? GILMORE, IN SUCH A MISERABLE WORLD AS THIS IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF PEACE AND QUIETNESS? NO? AND YET YOU WOULD UPSET ME UPSET YOURSELF, UPSET GLYDE UPSET LAURA, AND WORST OF ALL, UPSET MARIAN. AND ALL FOR A TRIFLING NOTHING. HIS LAWYERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO DEMAND THESE CLAUSES AND IT SEEMS TO ME AS THAT THEY'RE ANXIOUS TO SETTLE BEFORE SHE COMES OF AGE. NOW, IF YOU STAND FIRM, THEY MUST GIVE WAY. YOU DEAR OLD GILMORE HOW YOU DETEST GLYDE FOR BEING A BARONET. WHAT A RADICAL YOU ARE. OH, DEAR ME, WHAT A RADICAL. MR. FAIRLIE, I WILL PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL OF YOUR PROVOCATION BUT AFTER HOLDING THE SOUNDEST CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES ALL MY LIFE, AND SERVING THREE GENERATIONS OF FAIRLIES I WILL NOT PUT UP WITH BEING CALLED A RADICAL. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT NO DAUGHTER OF MINE SHOULD BE MARRIED UNDER SUCH A SETTLEMENT! DON'T SHAKE THE ROOM, WORTHIEST OF ALL POSSIBLE GILMORES. DO NOT SHAKE THE ROOM. I WOULD DISPUTE THIS REMOTE CONTINGENCY WITH YOU IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T; I HAVEN'T STAMINA ENOUGH. SHALL WE DROP THE SUBJECT? THAT'S A GOOD GILMORE. YOU HOLD BY THIS, THEN? SO GLAD WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AT LAST. MAKE THEM GIVE YOU A GOOD LUNCH DOWNSTAIRS. DO, GILMORE MAKE MY IDLE BEASTS OF SERVANTS GIVE YOU A GOOD LUNCH. DO YOU WANT SOME, SIR? DO YOU WANT SOME? DO YOU NOT REMEMBER ME? IS GLYDE HERE? WHAT? I SAW HIS CARRIAGE. WHAT IS SIR PERCIVAL TO YOU? I WANT TO HELP YOU, NOT HURT YOU. WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE? A MAN WAS ONCE KIND TO ME HERE. THIS MAN. AND HIS WIFE. BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHERS. GLYDE PUT ME IN THE COLD ASYLUM, SIR. TO THE COLD STONE AND THE BATHS. THEY SCREAM IN THE BATHS. I WAS WRONGFULLY TREATED. YOU MUST WARN THEM HERE. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE. (gasps) WARN THEM OF WHAT? I WANT NOTHING EXCEPT TO HELP YOU. YES, TO HELP ME. AND THEN THEY PULL AT YOU WITH THEIR LIPS. STILL THERE'S COINS IN THOSE PURSED LIPS. PLEASE. PLEASE! I MEAN YOU NO HARM. Percival: I'M MIGHTILY GLAD, MR. HARTRIGHT THAT YOU MET WITH ANNE CATHERICK. BUT I WAS MOST INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT SHE WAS AT LIMMERIDGE CHURCH. IT IS MY URGENT WISH THAT SHE'S FOUND WITHOUT DELAY. HAVE YOU KNOWN HER LONG? Percival: YES. HER MOTHER, ONE OF OUR MORE FAITHFUL RETAINERS AT BLACKWATER WAS DOUBLY UNFORTUNATE IN HAVING A HUSBAND WHO DESERTED HER AND A DAUGHTER WHOSE MENTAL FACULTIES WERE DISTURBED AT AN EARLY AGE. IN TIME, THE POOR GIRL'S SYMPTOMS MADE IT NECESSARY FOR HER TO HAVE MEDICAL CARE. BUT MRS. CATHERICK DID NOT WANT ANNE TO GO TO A PUBLIC ASYLUM. SHE APPEALED TO ME TO MEET THE EXPENSE OF A GOOD PRIVATE ASYLUM WHICH-- IN MARK OF HER SERVICES TO OUR FAMILY-- I WAS HAPPY TO DO. KIDSON, A HARLEY STREET SPECIALIST WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE CASE. AND DID SHE IMPROVE? NO, SHE DID NOT. AND AS HER CONDITION WORSENED, SHE DEVELOPED A CONFUSED HATRED FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IN HER TREATMENT INCLUDING, I'M AFRAID, HER MOTHER AND ME. SO I HOPE SHE'S RETURNED TO PROPER MEDICAL ATTENTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I HAVE TO LEAVE TOMORROW. I WILL WATCH FOR HER TONIGHT FROM THE CHURCH. Gilmore: WE MUST ALL HOPE THE POOR GIRL IS FOUND AND I WILL COMMUNICATE ALL YOU HAVE SAID TO LAURA'S UNCLE AND GUARDIAN. I IMAGINE THAT ENDS THE MATTER. NO... IT DOES NOT. IF MY PLAIN STATEMENT OF LEGAL FACT HAD ONLY BEEN ADDRESSED TO YOU, MR. GILMORE AND TO YOU, MR. HARTRIGHT THEN I SHOULD CONSIDER ANY FURTHER REFERENCE TO THIS UNHAPPY MATTER AS UNNECESSARY. BUT... MISS FAIRLIE, MY POSITION WITH A LADY IS NOT THE SAME. I HOPE, SIR PERCIVAL YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE I DISTRUST YOU. NO. BUT I OWE TO YOU WHAT I WOULD CONCEDE TO NO MAN ALIVE-- PROOF OF WHAT I SAY. HERE IS THE ADDRESS AND NAME OF ANNE'S MOTHER. MAY I INSIST YOU WRITE AT ONCE TO ASK ANYTHING YOU WISH AND ENSURE THAT SHE CONFIRMS MY ACCOUNT? SIR PERCIVAL WATCHED ALL NIGHT HERE BUT HE SAW NO SIGN OF HER. WHY WATCH FROM HERE? YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE GRAVE. DID YOU FIND HIS ACCOUNT CONVINCING? MORE THAN I THOUGHT POSSIBLE. TO TALK WITH ANNE CATHERICK. THEN WE MUST KEEP LOOKING. I THINK I WILL START MAKING MOONLIGHT SKETCHES AROUND THE ESTATE. THERE IS A CHANCE I MAY SEE HER. BEGGING YOUR PARDON, MISS. YES, MARGARET? I WONDER IF I MIGHT ASK YOU SOMETHING. OF COURSE-- WHAT IS IT? I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO TROUBLE YOU BECAUSE IT MAY BE NOTHING AT ALL, BUT I WASN'T SURE. IF SOMETHING IS WORRYING YOU I'LL HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN. IT IS MR. HARTRIGHT. MR. HARTRIGHT? WHAT ABOUT HIM? WELL, YOU SEE, IT WAS GETTING LATE AND I SAW HE WAS THERE DOWN BY THE SUMMER HOUSE AND IT'S JUST I WASN'T SURE WHAT HE WAS DOING WHETHER HE NEEDED ANYTHING. OH, I SEE. NO, MARGARET, HE WANTS TO SKETCH VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ESTATE IN MOONLIGHT. PLEASE HELP ACCOMMODATE THAT. I AM VERY KEEN TO SEE THE RESULTS. OH, YES, MISS. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, THEN. THANK YOU, MISS. JUST IT SEEMED RATHER LATE. YES. BUT I'LL GO THERE AT 10:00, IF IT HELPS HIM. THANK YOU, MISS. (door shuts) TOGOTHERE? (bell chimes) (screaming and crying) (sobbing) PLEASE, MISS, PLEASE! HE TRIED TO MAKE ME UNDRESS. WHAT? Hartright: MISS FAIRLIE! MISS FAIRLIE, PLEASE, I CAN EXPLAIN! PLEASE, LISTEN. Marian: INSIDE. GET HER INSIDE! Gilmore: I WAS ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF A PROPER CHAPERON IN YOUR ARRANGEMENTS HERE. FORTUNATELY, MR. HARTRIGHT IS LEAVING IN A FEW HOURS. BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THIS SERVANT TO CONSIDER. SIR PERCIVAL HAS ALREADY OFFERED THE SERVANT CONCERNED A POSITION AT BLACKWATER PARK SO THE CHANGE OF SCENE SHOULD HELP HER. AND PL DON'T FORGET, MR. GILMORE IT WAS MARIAN WHO SAVED HER. WELL, THIS IS TRUE. AND PROVIDED BOTH OF YOU ACCEPT THAT YOU WERE COMPLETELY DUPED BY THIS YOUNG MAN I SUGGEST WE LET THE MATTER REST. I ACCEPT THAT WE WERE DECEIVED. I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT I WAS WRONG TO TAKE EVERY MEANS AT MY DISPOSAL TO FIND ANNE CATHERICK. HER MOTHER HAS NOW WRITTEN TO ME. EVIDENTLY, ALL THAT SIR PERCIVAL SAID IS TRUE TO THE LETTER. Hartright: MISS FAIRLIE! I WILL BE GONE IN A FEW MINUTES. ONE I WILL BE GONE MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.ASE GRANT ME IF I'M FOUND WITH YOU, I WILL BE PUNISHED. THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY. I SAY NOTHING FOR MYSELF BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I WAS DISGRACED LEAD ME TO SUPPOSE YOU AND YOUR SISTER ARE IN VERY GREAT DANGER. I BEG YOU TO TAKE HEED OF THAT DANGER. (sobbing) Marian: MR. HARTRIGHT'S DISGRACE WAS SUCH PAINFUL PROOF OF OUR OWN INEXPERIENCE THTO FORGET ALL MY DOUBTS. IT HAD BEEN AGREED I WOULD JOIN HER AS SOON AS THE HONEYMOON WAS OVER. AND HOW STRANGE IT SEEMS NOW TO THINK THAT I TRAVELED THAT LONG ROAD IN HOPE. Man: WELCOME, YOUR LADYSHIP. OH, LAURA! OH! OH, HOW LONG IT SEEMS! MARIAN, I'M SORRY, I'M TIRED FROM THE JOURNEY. WILL YOU EXCUSE ME? MISS FAIRLIE... I MUST APOLOGIZE. LAURA IS A LITTLE TIRED. BUT HOW NICE TO FIND YOU AWAITING US. I REGRET TO SAY IT SEEMS WE HAVE A GUEST ARRIVING LATER IN THE WEEK-- SOME WRETCHED COUSIN WHOM I BARELY KNOW. STILL, HE WILL ONLY BE HERE A SHORT TIME. WILL YOU EXCUSE ME? MATTERS HAVE REACHED A HEAD AND THE SITUATION MAY BECOME SERIOUS. (voice fading): WE MUST ADDRESS IT AT ONCE. Percival: BUT IF I CAN OBTAIN THE SIGNATURE TO THE PAPERS. THAT WILL RESOLVE THE QUESTION AT A STROKE. THAT WILL RESOLVE THE QUESWE CAN THEN PROCEED TO CLEAR THE OUTSTANDING BILLS TO CLEAR THE OUTSTANDING BILLSY BECOME DUE. (door shuts in near distance) Woman: PLEASE! (Laura and Percival arguing; conversation muffled) SIR PERCIVAL, I WONDER IF I MIGHT HAVE A WORD WITH YOU REGARDING SOMETHING. MISS FAIRLIE, OF COURSE. I HAVE BEEN HERE FOUR DAYS NOW. IF SHE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE HERE THEN I CAN LEAVE. BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WILL NOT TALK TO ME. I CANNOT WHOLLY UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF. I HAVE KEPT EXPECTING HER TO CHANGE BUT I FEAR THE MOODS OF WOMEN ARE SOMETIMES UNACCOUNTABLE TO ME. YOU HAVE HER MESSAGES. SHE MAKES EXCUSES-- SHE HAS BUSINESS, SHE IS TIRED. ONCE I PASSED HER AND SHE TALKS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN GOES ON. IF I HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO OFFEND HER THEN I WILL BE DULY SORRY, BUT I MUST FIRST KNOW WHAT IT IS. BELIEVE ME, MISS FAIRLIE, YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING TO OFFEND HER. YOU MUST SIMPLY GIVE HER TIME. IHAVEGIVEN HER TIME. AND IF, AS YOU SAY, I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG THEN I MUST LEAVE AND RETURN TO MY UNCLE BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR SHE DOES NOT WANT ME. PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM THE SERVANTS TO PREPARE FOR MY DEPARTURE. I HAVE EVERY HOPE SHE MIGHT CHANGE AND I WILL TRY AO PREVAIL UPON HER TO BE MORE CIVIL. PLEASE... STAY LONGER. NO. YOU'VE BEEN KIND BUT I CANNOT IMPOSE MYSELF IF SHE DOES NOT WISH ME TO BE HERE. (door opens and closes) Laura: MARIAN... DO NOT LEAVE HERE. OH, DEAR GOD, DO NOT LEAVE! LAURA, OH, LAURA! IT WAS A BAD DREAM. WHY WOULD YOU NOT TALK? WHAT IS THIS? IT WAS A FALL. I MUST GO BACK NOW I MUSWE WILL TALK TOMORROW.W, I AM SO SORRY. LAURA, YOU MUST TELL ME. WHATEVER THE MATTER IS, YOU MUST TELL ME. I BEG YOU. WHEN WE WERE IN ITALY, WE WENT TO SEE A WONDERFUL TOMB THAT A HUSBAND HAD BUILT FOR HIS WIFE. SHE WAS CALLED CECILIA, CECILIA METELLA. IT WAS A BRIGHT AFTERNOON. I ASKED PERCIVAL IF HE WOULD EVER BUILD SOMETHING LIKE IT FOR ME. HIS REPLY WAS THAT IF HE DID, TH MY OWN MONEY. IT WAS A JOKE, LAURA. WHAT OF IT? I AM SURE THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT MUST PROVIDE FOR HIM TO INHERIT AT LEAST IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE NO CHILDREN. AND, MARIAN, I DO NOT WANT CHILDREN NOT THE WAY HE TOUCHES ME WHEN HE... TELL ME. I NEVER KNEW MEN COULD ENJOY THE ACT EVEN IN HATRED. WHY DOES HE HATE ME? IS IT BECAUSE I HAVE DONE SOMETHING? YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING. AND YOU MUST NEVER THINK OF YOURSELF IN THIS WAY. THEN I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE. HE WANTS MY MONEY, AND I AM SURE HE IS PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING TO GET IT. COME ON, WE MUST GO BACK. LAURA, YOU CANNOT BE SURE. PERHAPS IF YOU WOULD TALK TO HIM. I HAVE TRIED. SOMETIMES I HAVE SEEN SADNESS BUT... NOW I KEEP REMEMBERING THE WARNING OF THAT WOMAN, THE POOR WOMAN IN WHITE. (barking, neighing) Man: WATCH YOURSELF, MY LADY. A DOG HAS BROKEN LOOSE! HE'S DANGEROUS! (growling) KEEP STILL, DON'T RUN! WE'VE SENT FOR THE KEEPER. LADIES, KEEP QUITE STILL, PLEASE. Man: MIND, SIR HE FLIES AT EVERYONE. HE DOES THAT, MY FRIEND BECAUSE EVERYONE IS AFRAID OF HIM. LET US SEE IF HE FLIES AT ME. CAREFUL, SIR. (continues muttering) (chuckles) MISS FAIRLIE, LADY GLYDE, YES? I WOULD BEG YOUR VERY GREAT FORGIVENESS. IN MY HASTE, I NEGLECTED TO MAKE MY INTRODUCTIONS. I AM COUNT ISIDORO OTTAVIO FOSCO ONCE, THROUGH MY PARENTS, OF SIENA, NOW OF PARIS ARRIVING FOR ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN MY LIFE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO MY COUSIN AND HIS BEAUTIFUL HOME. I MUST ADMIT THAT MY EARLY LIFE WAS SPENT LIKE ANYONE ELSE'S-- IN INNOCENT FOLLY. I RULED THE FASHIONS OF A SECOND-RATE ITALIAN TOWN AND WROTE PREPOSTEROUS ROMANCES FOR A THIRD-RATE NEWSPAPER. THEN I STUDIED LAW, FINANCE AND CHEMISTRY, IN THAT ORDER. LAURA, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TO SIGN IT'S A FORMALITY BUT WE MAY AS WELL DO IT NOW SO THE BOY CAN TAKE IT DOWN TO THE TRAIN. THE COUNT AND MISS FAIRLIE CAN BE WITNESSES IF THEY DON'T MIND. WHAT IS IT I AM TO SIGN? I WOULD TELL YOU, BUT WE'RE SHORT OF TIME AND I DOUBT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND IT. I ASK YOU TO LET ME TRY. WHEN MR. GILMORE HAD ANY BUSINESS HE ALWAYS EXPLAINED IT. WELL, I DARESAY BUT YOU SEE, HE WAS YOUR SERVANT AND WAS OBLIGED TO DO SO. I AM YOUR HUSBAND AND I'M IN A HURRY. (nervously): IT IS JUST... IF MY SIGNATURE PLEDGES ME TO... YOU'RE NOT REFUSING ME, SURELY. NO. PROCEED TO SIGN IT AT ONCE.L SIR PERCIVAL, PERHAPS I MAY EXPLAIN LAURA'S OBJECTION... Percival: MISS FAIRLIE I HOPE VERY MUCH YOU CAN CONTINUE TO BE OUR GUEST BUT IT COULD OBVIOUSLY BECOME DIFFICULT IF YOU CHOOSE TO INTERFERE IN OUR AFFAIRS. IT IS JUST... PARDON ME FOR ONE MOMENT, SIR PERCIVAL THAT I SPEAK WITH RESPECT. WHAT THAT DOCUMENT THAT LADY GLYDE IS ABOUT TO SIGN MAY BE I NEITHER KNOW NOR DESIRE TO KNOW BUT I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT WITNESSING ANY SIGNATURE AT ALL WITHOUT A FULL AND FAIR UNDERSTANDING BY THE SIGNATORY. YOU TAKE MY WIFE'S SIDE? I TAKE THE SIDE OF MY POOR EUROPEAN CONSCIENCE WHICH IS DIFFERENT. BY ALL MEANS, SET ME DOWN AS BEING NO BETTER THAN THE REST OF MY KIND. I WILL SEE IF MY LAWYER CAN FIND SOME WAY AROUND IT. NOW, I REALLY MUST GET THE REST OF THESE PAPERS OFF. WITHOUT YOU AND THE COUNT HE WOULD HAVE MADE ME SIGN IT. PLEASE, MARIAN, GIVE HIM NO EXCUSE TO MAKE YOU LEAVE. I WILL NEVER LEAVE WITHOUT YOU. BUT, LAURA, YOU MUST NOW TEL MANY THINGS-- POISON, A FALL A BOATING ACCIDENT IN THE LAKE. HE WANTS M IF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS TRUE, THERE ARE LAWS. LAWS CANNOT PREVENT EVIL, THEY MAY ONLY AVENGE IT. I HAVE NO EVIDENCE AGAINST MY HUSBAND EXCEPT THAT HE IS CRUEL. WHAT IS THAT? SO ARE HALF THE MEN IN ENGLAND. I WANT TO SEE. WHY? PLEASE. NEVER AGAIN. I DON'T CARE IF YOU KILL HIM; YOU WILL NOT LET HIM NEAR YOU. FROM THIS MOMENT ON, I SWEAR OUR ENDURANCE ENDS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT CAN WE DO? WE CAN FIGHT. Marian: "I HAVE NO MEANS OF PROVING MY SUSPICIONS, MR. GILMORE "ANY MORE THAN I CAN PROVE "THE BURNED DOCUMENT FORMED SOME PART OF A PLOT "TO TAKE MY SISTER'S MONEY. "I KNOW MY UNCLE WILL NOT COUNTENANCE A SCANDAL "BUT I BEG YOU TO ASK HIM WHETHER THERE IS SOME WAY "LAURA AND I COULD RETURN ALONE TO LIMMERIDGE AT LEAST FOR A PROLONGED VISIT." (panting) (gasps) WHO ARE YOU? YOU'RE NOT LADY GLYDE, ARE YOU? NO. NO, ANNE, I'M NOT. I AM HER HALF-SISTER. WHAT? THEY USE YOU, MISS, DO THEY? ANNE, I COULD HELP YOU TO SEE LADY GLYDE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO HELP YOU? I DON'T NEED HELP. I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE TO THE ASYLUM. NO, I WON'T TAKE YOU BACK THERE BUT WE CAN HELP. YOU WANT TO SEE LADY GLYDE? TO TELL HER THE DANGER. IT'S NOT SAFE HERE, MISS. NEVER, NEVER MARRY, MISS. I TRAVEL FREE; I CHOOSE. CAN YOU CHOOSE, MISS? WHAT IS THE DANGER? WHERE CAN WE FIND YOU? AFTER DUSK, TOMORROW... THE BOATHOUSE. BUT YOU MUST TELL NO ONE ELSE. THE SECRET FRIGHTENS HIM. I PROMISE. BUT WHAT SECRET? ANNE! Laura: ILL BE HERE TONIGHT WE MUST BRING HER FOOD AND CLOTHING. I WILL LOOK OUT FOR SOME OF MY OWN. SHE HAD SUCH SADNESS. SHE'S FREE. BUT AT WHAT COST, LAURA? DOES IT MATTER, MARIAN? AT LEAST SHE CAN MOVE ON FROM THOSE WHO ABUSE HER. AND SO CAN YOU. MY LETTER WAS IN THE POST THIS MORNING. BY TOMORROW IT WILL BE WITH GILMORE AND HE MUST ACT. AND THE COUNT HELPED US BEFORE. HE WILL AGAIN. (playing somber piece) (birds chirp) (chuckling) OH, MISS FAIRIE SEE THE LIGHT DYING IN THE TREES. DOES IT NOT BREAK THE HEART? AH, BUT COUNT... THE HEART WILL SURELY MEND BY MORNING. YOU HAVE YOUR THE HEART WILL SURENGLISH SENSE, MEND BY MORNING. MISS FAIRLIE BUT YOU CANNOT DENY WHAT IS SO STRIKING-- THAT YOU FEEL THINGS VERY DEEPLY. Laura: I WOULD NOT DENY IT. AND YES, THE LIGHT IS BEAUTIFUL. AND AS YOUR POET SAYS... "TRUTH IS BEAUTY." (laughs softly) SEE, YOUR FACE SHOWS AS MUCH NOW. SO, YOU STUDY POETRY AS WELL AS CRIME, COUNT. BUT I WISH TO KNOW IS YOUR STUDY OF DETECTION AN AMATEUR INTEREST ONLY? TO BE TRUTHFUL? NO. BUT THEN I HAVE DABBLED IN MANY THINGS INCLUDING THE SCIENCE OF CHARACTER AND I SEE THAT YOUR SISTER IS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU AS AN ALLY. I HAET ANYONE LIKE YOU. NEST WITH YOU. THEN I MUST BE AT THIS MOMENT, WE'RE IN NEED OF AS MANY FRIENDS AS WE CAN FIND AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. Laura: YOU'RE QUITE SURE WE ARE NOT FOLLOWED? Marian: I AM CERTAIN OF IT. (door creaks open) NOT ALONE? Marian: IT IS AL RIGHT, ANNE. THERE IS NO ONE HERE BUT US. LOOK. WE HAVE FOOD AND CLOTHING FOR YOU. LADY GLYDE'S THINGS WILL FIT YOU. MY LADY... I HAVE YOUR WORD YOU ARE ALONE? YOU HAVE MY WORD. I HAVE ONLY KEPT OUT OF THEIR SIGHT BY MOVING FROM VILLAGE TO TOWN STAYING IN WOODS AND DITCHES. NO ONE WILL LISTEN. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO MIGHT BELIEVE. THERE IS A SECRET. IT WOULD DESTROY HIM. WHAT IS IT? ANNE? IT IS HIDDEN. (faint barking) I'M SURE I HEARD A NOISE. (barking grows louder) (horses approaching) (horses neighing, dogs barking) (quavers) ANNE! (shouts): GET HER! Marian: STOP! STOP THIS! LEAVE HER! (shouting and barking continue) STOP! (barking intensifies) (gasps) LEAVE HER BE! (Anne cries out) STOP THEM, PLEASE! (men snicker) (dogs growl, Anne quavers) Percival: ALL RIGHT, BAXTER, GET HER UP. THE POOR WOMAN'S ORDEAL IS AT AN END. WE WILL CONFINE HER... UNTIL AN ASYLUM CAN BE FOUND. (roughly): GET UP! I CURS BETRAYER! MAY YOUR BODY TWIST AND FALL FROM THE HIGHEST TOWER OF BLACKWATER PARK! ANNE, I DIDN'T, I DIDN'T LET HIM KNOW! MOVE IT, MISS! ANNE! WHAT IS THIS? Man: COME ON! WELL, LET US JUST SAY IT IS POOR ANNE'S. SHE'S IN NEED OF CLOTHES. OH, AND THERE IS EXCELLENT NEWS. THE GOOD COUNT HAS AGREED TO STAY ON... FOR SEVERAL MORE WEEKS, I HOPE. SO THE COUNT IS NO COUSIN, BUT YES, HE IS A SPECIALIST. GOD KNOWS WHAT HE WAS HIRED TO DO IN THIS HOUSE. BUT THE SIGNATURE? HE HELPED US. NO. HE KNEW I WOULD NOT LET YOU SIGN SO HE PRETENDED TO BE OUR ALLY. LIKE A STUPID GIRL FLATTERED BY HIS ATTENTION I LED HIM STRAIGHT TO ANNE. SO WHAT WILL THEY DO? (sighs) WE WILL NOT WAIT TO SEE. WE'RE LEAVING. (footsteps approach) AND, LAURA, FOR ALL HIS TALK I'M SURE THE COUNT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY OF THEM. Marian: NEVER LET HIM SEE WHAT WE FEEL. (Fosco whistles melodiously) (imitates bird) (whistles tune) (speaking French whimsically) TA PETITE QUEUE. (laughs) OH... MAIS... TU VOYAGES, EH? (laughs) (whispers playfully in French) MRS. RIDEOUT? (footsteps outside) MRS. RIDEOUT? MRS. RIDEOUT, I NEED YOUR HELP AGAIN TO SEND A TELEGRAM. MARGARET. WHERE'S MRS. RIDEOUT? SHE'S GONE, MISS. GONE WHERE? SHE'S LEFT. YOU SEE, I'M TO BE HOUSEKEEPER. YOU? THE OTHER SERVANTS HAVE HAD THEIR NOTICE. THE LAST OF THEM ARE OFF NOW... APART FROM LIZA HERE. Marian: YOU MEAN IT IS JUST LIZA AND YOU? OH, YES, MISS. SIR PERCIVAL HAS BEEN VERY KIND. AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH MR. HARTRIGHT. MARGARET PORCHER IS ON THEIR SIDE. SHE'S HOUSEKEEPER TO HIM NOW. NO, PLEASE. I DOUBT I CAN DO BETTER. (giggles softly) LADIES, MAY I PRESENT TO YOU MY DEAR WIFE WHO HAS JUST NOW JOINED OUR COMPANY? Countess Fosco: CAN I SAY HOW PLEASED I AM TO BE OF THE PARTY. Marian (whispering): THEY ARE CLEARING THE HOUSE. Laura (whispering): YES, IT IS JUST AS WALTER HARTRIGHT WARNED. HE BEGGED ME TO BELIEVE HIM AND I JUST TURNED AWAY BUT I SEE IT SO CLEARLY NOW. HE WAS INNOCENT, MARIAN. THEY MADE HIM THEIR VICTIM. (sighs) WE WILL LEAVE AS SOON AS IT IS DARK. THE STATION IS HALF AN HOUR'S WALK. IF WE CATCH THE LATE TRAIN, WE ARE SAFE. TAKE WHAT YOU CAN. I WILL JOIN YOU ON THE LAWN AFTER DINNER. BEG PARDON, SIR. HOW CAN YOU GET THROUGH SO MUCH CREAM, FOSCO? Fosco: A TASTE FOR SWEETS IS THE INNOCENT TASTE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. I LOVE TO SHARE IT WITH THEM. ANOTHER BOND, DEAR LADIES BETWEEN YOU AND ME. OH, THIS WEATHER IS IMPOSSIBLE. IT MUST BREAK SOON. IT WILL BREAK. I HAVE TOLD YOU, SOON NOW. BY THE WAY, THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF POACHERS IN THE PARK WITH GUNS. BAXTER IS STANDING GUARD BUT IT'S HIGHLY DANGEROUS. YOU UNDERSTAND? I TAKE IT THE GARDEN IS SAFE. YES, PROVIDED YOU STAY IN IT AND DO NOT VENTURE OUT. OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE-- YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THE HONOR OF MY COUNTRY IS AT STAKE-- UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME MORE PRESSING BUSINESS IN WHICH CASE I COULD ACCOMPANY YOU. YOU SEE, THE ENGLISH WERE ALWAYS REVILING THE ITALIANS FOR THEIR MUSIC. I AM SORRY, I KNOW NOTHING OF MUSIC. BUT I'M SURE THEY FORGOT ROSSINI. AS A VERY GREAT PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME, MIGHT I ASK YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS AND SAY IF ANYTHING MORE SUBLIME HAS BEEN COMPOSED? (playing deep chord) (continues playing tune) I HAVE NO WISH TO INTERRUPT THE COUNT BUT I AM FEELING A LITTLE FAINT BUT I AM FEELING AND I MUST GET SOME AIR. THE COUNT WOULD NOT LET ME GO. WE MUST BE QUICK OR THE TRAIN WILL LEAVE. BUT THE POACHERS AND GUNS? THERE ARE NONE; THAT WAS JUST TO SCARE US. I HOPE WE NEVER SEE IT AGAIN. Marian: THE ROAD CANNOT BE FAR NOW. (branch snaps; cries out) I THINK I CAN SEE IT, JUST A SHORT... (gunshot; women shriek) QUICKLY! (gasping) QUICK! GET UP! (panting) IT WAS BAXTER. THERE WERE NO POACHERS. HE KNEW WHO WE WERE, BUT HE STILL SHOT. WHAT WOULD THEY CALL IT? AN ACCIDENT? AT FIRST LIGHT WE WILL GO TO THE STABLES. I WILL TELL THE GROOM THAT SIR PERCIVAL REQUIRES HIM URGENTLY AND THEN WE CAN TAKE THE CART OURSELVES. STAY WITH ME. NO. I MUST KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. Glyde (almost inaudible): ...TALKING IN RIDDLES. YOU'VE A JOB TO DO AND IT'S TIME NOW FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN. Fosco: I WILL COME TO AN EXPLANATION, SIR PERCIVAL ONLY WHEN I AM QUITE SATISFIED WE ARE UNDISTURBED. WE HAVE REACHED A CURIOUS CRISIS, AS YOU KNOW. I DO NY RISKS. (distant thunder) (thunder crashing) (clock chiming) (groans) D SIT DOWN; YOU'RE AS RESTLESS AS A CAT. HAVE SOME BRANDY AND WATER. YOU KNOW HOW CAREFUL WE MUST BE. THE COLD WATER WITH PLEASURE THE SPOON, BASIN OF SUGAR. EAU SUCREE,MY FRIEND, A WONDERFUL DRINK. A SICKLY MESS, YOU MEAN. YOU FOREIGNERS ARE ALL ALIKE. IT IS HERE AT LAST-- THE RAIN THAT WASHES AWAY OUR SINS. SO, SIR PERCIVAL HOW WOULD YOU TREAT A WOMAN WHO OPPOSES YOU? KNOCK HER DOWN. YES, THAT IS ONE INFERIOR ROUTE CHOSEN BY THE LOWER ORDERS BUT THE SUPERIOR WAY IS TO DENY ALL THEIR SUSPICIONS AND NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACCEPT A PROVOCATION AT THEIR HANDS. YET, DESPITE ALL MY WARNING AND ENTREATIES YOU KEEP FORGETTING THIS CRUCIAL FACT WITH YOUR WIFE'S SIS YOU KEEP FORGETTING THIS CRUCIAL AS A SPECIALIST.IFE'S SISED ME Percival: ARE YOU GOING TO STAND IN THE RAIN ALL NIGHT? SO AS A SPECIALIST, I TELL YOU, SIR PERCIVAL IN THIS SWEET RAIN, THAT THERE ARE LIMITS EVEN TO THE MALE PREJUDICES OF YOUR GOOD COUNTRY. WE CANNOT KEEP THESE WOMEN HERE INDEFINITELY. OF COURSE, BUT WHERE ARE YOU LEADING? I SAW THAT YOUR WIFE'S SISTER WOULD LOSE US THE SIGNATURE TO THE DEED. I GE AND SECURED ANNE CATHERICK. BUT WITHOUT THE SIGNATURE WE ARE HAVING TO DO SOMETHING INFINITELY MORE COMPLICATED AND INFINITELY MORE DANGEROUS. ARE YOU READY FOR THAT? OF COURSE, BUT HOW? Percival: THE DEBTS MOUNT AND THERE IS DANGER, TOO. ANNE ALMOST TOLD THE WOMEN OF THE WILL MY FATHER MADE AT THE END. AND I STILL CANNOT FIND WHERE SHE'S HIDDEN IT. AND THE WILL WOULD DISINHERIT YOU. WHY? YOU HAVE HINTED AT SOMETHING WORSE. IT WILL NEVER BE DISCLOSED. NOW, COME TO THE POINT: I WOULD HAVE ACTED EARLIER AND MORE CRUDELY AGAINST MY WIFE. YOU RESTRAINED ME. TIME IS RUNNING OUT SO I SAY TO YOU AGAIN, HOW? I SHALL TELL YOU HOW. FIRST, WE MUST SEPARATE THE WOMEN. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, PERCIVAL? WE MUST SEPARATE THEM TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST. THEN I, FOSCO, WILL RESORT TO THE MOST OMNIPOTENT OF ALL TYRANTS, THE CHEMIST. AND THEN TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST... (thunder rumbling loudly) LIGHT! BRING A LIGHT! SOMEONE IS OUT THERE. THEN WE'LL FIND HER, TOO. (groaning) (moaning) (footsteps approaching) TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST, TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST TOMORROW... TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST, TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST, TOMORROW AT BREAKFAST... (footsteps pass down hallway) (gasping) AT DAWN... I MUST GO TO HER AT DAWN. (footsteps pass again in hallway) Marian: NO BREAKFAST... NOT A BREAKFAST WITH THE CHEMIST. (bashing at door) OH, NO. LAURA.... I MUST SEE LAURA. (Marian screaming) (crying) LEAVE HER! GET HIM OUT! NO! (no voice) (crying) NO! (screaming): NO! Marian: DREAM... DEAR GOD, ONLY A DREAM. BUT THIS IS NOT MY ROOM. WHY HAVE I BEEN MOVED? YOU'VE BEEN IN A FEVER, MARIAN. THE DOCTORS MOVED YOU SIMPLY FOR THE RISK OF INFECTION. MR. GILMORE, THANK HEAVENS YOU'VE COME. OF COURSE I CAME. I WANTED TO BE SURE I WAS THE ONE WHO SAW YOU FIRST. WHY? WHERE'S LAURA? THEY HAD TO BREAK OPEN THE DOOR TO GET HELP TO YOU BUT THE DOCTORS SAY YOU ARE STRONGER NOW AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO BE BRAVE, MARIAN. THERE IS BAD NEWS. YOU WERE TOLD ABOUT IT BEFORE, EVIDENTLY BUT NOBODY KNEW HOW MUCH YOU'D TAKEN IN. TOLD WHAT? THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT. LAURA... IS DEAD. SHE FELL FROM THE TOWER. THEY HAVE KILLED HER, THEN. Gilmore: PLEASE, MARIAN. YOU ARE STILL NOT STRONG. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I HEARD THEM PLOTTING. GLYDE AND FOSCO DRUGGED AND KILLED HER. GLYDE HAD NO HAND IN HER DEATH. LAURA'S MIND HAD BEEN TURNED BY ANNE CATHERICK'S PROPHECY. THERE ARE WITNESSES. WHO? A RESPECTABLE DOCTOR I KNOW WHO WAS TENDING YOUR FEVER. HE WAS WITH GLYDE AND FOSCO WHEN SHE FELL. IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. LIZA AND MARGARET PORCHER WOULD HAVE DONE IT. GLYDE USED MARGARET AGAINST HARTRIGHT. HE HAS PAID HER TO KILL LAURA. THIS IS MADNESS! WHO ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE INVOLVED? THE GROOM? THE STABLE BOY? THE DOCTOR HIMSELF? THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST PROOF OF ANY OF THESE ACCUSATIONS AND I WILL NOT HEAR OF IT. BUT THEY WERE ALL IN LEAGUE AGAINST US. THERE IS SOME SECRET HIDDEN-- A WILL THAT WOULD DISINHERIT SIR PERCIVAL. I SHALL NOT LISTEN TO THIS, MARIAN. GLYDE WOULD HAVE THE PERFECT RIGHT TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST YOU. NOW, PLEASE, COME DOWN... FOR LAURA'S SAKE. FROM HER SHAWL. IT WAS FROM LAURA'S SHAWL. Marian: I WOULD NOT GO TO THE FUNERAL. I SAID I WAS ILL. AND WEEKS HAD PASSED BEFORE I COULD BEAR TO SEE HER GRAVE. I PROMISE, LAURA... WHATEVER IT TAKES. AND SO I LEFT LIMMERIDGE, SCENE OF ALL MY HAPPIEST MEMORIES AS READILY AS ONE LEAVES A SCORCHED DESERT. AND WITH ONLY ONE THOUGHT IN MY HEART-- THE PROMISE I HAD MADE AT HER GRAVESIDE-- I SET OUT ON A NEW LIFE. Gilmore: THE FOSCOS SENT WORD THEY ARE HAPPY FOR YOU TO JOIN THEM BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D WISH TO GO. I HAVE PROBABLY MISJUDGED THEM. THE CHANGE OF SCENE WILL DO ME GOOD. DID YOU FIND NEWS OF ANNE CATHERICK? SHE'S IN A PRIVATE ASYLUM BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER WHERE. MRS. CATHERICK HAS GONE ABROAD SO THERE'S NO MORE I CAN DO. MY DEAR MISS FAIRLIE NATURALLY I OFFER YOU MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES. WE ARE BEGUILED THAT YOU HAVE ELECTED TO JOIN US. WAS THE HOTEL TO YOUR LIKING? VERY MUCH SO. NOW, SHALL WE START THE TOUR, COUNT? I'VE ALWAYS LONGED TO SEE THE MUSEUM. WHAT GIFTS THEY LEFT FOR THE DEAD. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, MISS FAIRLIE? IF I DO, COUNT WE TALK IN THE MOST HAUNTED ROOM IN ENGLAND. IT IS SO LONG SINCE WE LAST TALKED TOGETHER. I STILL REMEMBER THAT WONDERFUL TWILIGHT. THIS ROOM IS NOT TOMYTASTE, COUNT. I SHALL MOVE ON TO THE TREASURES. I REMEMBER THE TWILIGHT AND I HAVE OFTEN REFLECTED SINCE THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. RIGHT? THE HEART DOES NOT MEND BY MORNING. NOW I THINK I WILL TAKE YOUR CARRIAGE BACK IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION. I FEEL A LITTLE TIRED AND I HAVE NO WISH TO INTERRUPT MADAME FOSCO'S TOUR. OF COURSE... THE CARRIAGE WILL TAKE YOU SAFELY BACK TO THE HOTEL. I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU FURTHER OVER DINNER. I AM MISS FAIRLIE, WITH COUNT FOSCO'S PARTY. THEY'RE OUT FOR THE DAY BUT IT APPEARS AN ITEM OF MY WARDROBE WAS SENT TO HIS SUITE BY MISTAKE. I WISH TO COLLECT IT. ROOM 11, MISS. THANK YOU. (fabric tears) (outer door opens) MISS FAIRLIE! I AM SORRY, MY CAPE WAS SEPARATED FROM MY LUGGAGE AND IT SEEMS THE PORTER BROUGHT IT HERE BY MISTAKE. AH. BUT YOU HAVE RETRIEVED IT. GOOD. WELL, I FOLLOWED YOUR EXAMPLE. THE MUSEUM WAS TOO EXHAUSTING. AND NOW YOU'RE HERE, WILL YOU HAVE SOME REFRESHMENT WITH ME? FOR A FEW MOMENTS AT LEAST? Fosco: I THINK WE'RE ALL IN NEED OF SOME REFRESHMENT. NO? SEE, MISS FAIRLIE, MY MICE HAVE NOT EATEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE. AND SINCE THEY KNOW NO OTHER MORALITY FOOD IS THEIR ONLY NOTION OF VIRTUE. "A GOOD NOTION OF VIRTUE, TOO" SAYS FOSCO. SAYS FOSCO. MAN WHO SAYS WHAT OTHERS ONLY THINK. AND WHAT IS YOUR VIRTUE, MISS FAIRLIE? I SUPPOSE THE SAME AS MY NOTION OF GOODNESS. EXCELLENT, MISS FAIRLIE, EXCELLENT. HERE IS MY NOTION OF GOODNESS. TINCTURE OF LAUDANUM. MANY FIND IT HELPS THEIR DISPOSITION AND SINCE YOUR NOTION OF GOODNESS EVIDENTLY EMBRACES LYING, STEALING KEYS RANSACKING PEOPLE'S ROOMS AND DESTROYING THEIR PROPERTY IN SEARCH OF EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM I'M SURE IT CAN EXTEND TO IAUDANUM... WHICH IS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR! (gasps) YES, THIS WOMAN HERE WAS ATTEMPTING TO STEAL FROM ME. NUM. YES, THIS WOMAN HERE WAS ATTEMPTING TO STEAL FROM ME.DA COLLECT HER THINGS AND THROW HER OUT. Marian: THERE HAS BEEN A MURDER! MY SISTER WAS MURDERED BY HER HUSBAND! GET OFF! GO ON! (people clamoring, man snickering) (woman chattering provocatively) MUST GET A CAB... (yelps; carriage wheels trundle ) (winces) YOU SEE, MISS FAIRLIE, ATTACK ME AND I MUST DEFEND MYSELF. I FEAR THAT ONCE YOUR UNCLE HEARS OF THIS YOU WILL BE AN OUTCAST: LIAR, THIEF, BETRAYER OF HOSPITALITY, DEGENERATE. YOU THINK I CARE? I ONLY WANT TO DO YOU AND YOUR KIND HARM AND I WILL COMMIT ANY CRIME TO ACHIEVE IT. OH, CORRUPTION WHERE ONCE IT BEGINS IS A WONDERFUL THING, IS IT NOT? THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, MISS FAIRLIE-- BUT THERE IS NO GOING BACK. I FEEL NOTHING BUT THE AFFINITY OF MASTER FOR PUPIL. CAB! YOU NOT ONLY CAUSED A SCANDAL YOU ALSO MADE WILD ACCUSATIONS WHICH MAY WELL PROMPT LEGAL ACTION. YOUR UNCLE IS SEVERELY ANGRY AND DISTURBED AND WILL NOW NOT HAVE YOU BACK AT LIMMERIDGE. IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE PERSUADED HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE A SMALL ALLOWANCE ENOUGH FOR LONDON ROOMS, BUT ONLY ON ONE CONDITION: THAT YOU GO NOWHERE NEAR LIMMERIDGE, NOT EVEN THE CHURCH. BUT WHY? AM I NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO VISIT MY OWN SISTER'S GRAVE? I AM SORRY, BUT I MUST HAVE YOUR UNDERTAKING. IS DESTITUTION. I AM SORRY, BUT I MUST HAVE YOUR UNDERTAKING.RNATIVE Man: COME ON, DARLING. (people laugh and chatter drunkenly) DEAR, GIVE US A FARTHING. (accordion playing) THERE'S A LADY OUTSIDE WANTS TO SEE YOU. SHE'S OFFERING TEN GUINEAS. HOW MUCH? TEN GUINEAS. SHE'S OUTSIDE. SORRY, BETTER OFFER. WHAT DOYOU M EAN? HEY! YOUR OFFER FOR A PORTRAIT IS GENEROUS BUT THIS SETTING IS HARDLY APPROPRIATE. WHY NOT COMMISSION AN ARTIST OF YOUR OWN STATION? BECAUSE, MR. HARTRIGHT I WISH TO SEEYOU. WE HAVE THE POWER TO AVENGE HER NOT TO LET ANYONE FORGET. FORGET? I THINK OF HER EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY HOUR. YES, I WOULD LOVE TO FORGET HOW I FAILED HER. YOU HAD NO CHOICE! SO I TOLD MYSELF WHEN I LEFT YOU-- WHAT A MISERABLE LIE. AND I LET HER DIE. NO, YOU DID NOT. I REMEMBER HOW YOU FOUGHT BACK, EVEN AFTER THEY CRUSHED YOU. LAURA REMEMBERED, TOO. SHE SPOKE OF IT OFTEN AT THE END. I'M AS GUILTY AS YOU ARE. I COUNSELED HER TO FORGET YOU. IF YOU ARE RIGHT, THEY PLANNED IT PERFECTLY. YOU WILL FIND NO EVIDENCE AGAINST THESE MEN. THE LAUDANUM YOU SAW PROVES NOTHING. BUT DO YOU NOT SEE? ONCE SHE WAS WEAK MARGARET PORCHER AND LIZA COULD FORCE HER TO THE TOWER. I CANNOT ACT ALONE. AS A WOMAN IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO TRAVEL ALONE BUT I DO HAVE A LITTLE MONEY. WILL YOU HELP ME? YES. I WILL DO ANYTHING. WHERE CAN WE BEGIN? PERHAPS WITH THE WOMEN. THEY CANNOT BE HARD TO TRACE. IF WE WORK TOGETHER AS EQUALS, WE CAN HURT THOSE WHO HURT US. YOUARECHANGED. YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK? LET THEM THINK WHAT THEY LIKE. WE CANNOT GO BACK TO SUCH SCRUPLES. THEY TOOK EVERYTHING WE HAD BUT WE ARE FREE. I WANT TO USE THAT AGAINST THEM. I WANT(knocking on door)ST THEM. TELL YOUR MISTRESS THLIE IS HERE WITH A MESSAGE FROM SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE. YES, MISS? I SAW YOU FROM THE WINDOW. WHAT DID YOU WANT? IS THERE SOMEONE WITH YOU? YES, THERE IS, MARGARET. PERHAPS YOU RECALL HIM. HELLO, MARGARET. WHY? WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT HIM? I BRING HIM BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ACCUSED HIM FALSELY AND YOU HAD A PART IN MURDERING MY SISTER. IT WOULD BE AS WELL FOR YOU IF YOU TOLD US WHAT YOUR PART WAS. (chuckles) IN OTHER WORDS, YOU KNOW NOTHING. YOU'RE MAKING WILD AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND I COULD ASK MY SERVANT TO THROW YOU BOTH OUT. YES,MYSERVANT, MISS. IOWNTHIS HOUSE NOW. I'M NOT A HOUSR ANYMORE AND I DON'T NEED TO BE BULLIED OR HARASSED BY YOU. GLYDE BOUGHT YOU THE HOUSE, DIDN'T HE? WHAT IF HE DID? NO LAW THAT I KNOW OF AGAINST REPAYING A RETAINER FOR FAITHFUL SERVICE. BUT WHATKIND OF SERVICE? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THE CLERGYMAN BOWS TO ME HERE. EVEN GLYDE DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BUT IT IS SO. I AM A RESPECTABLE WOMAN. BUT I AM NOT A RESPECTABLE MAN AND I HAVE ONLY YOU TO THANK FOR THAT. YOUR LIES BOL THIS AND OTHERS PAID DEARLY FOR IT. I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU. AND HOW ARE YOU TRAVELING TOGETHER, ANYAY? ARE YOU MARRIED? NO, YOU'RE NOT, ARE YOU? NOW GO. (rings bell) WE WILL NOT STOP. WE MEAN TO FIND ANNE CATHERICK. YOU CAN'T. WHY NOT? WHY? DOES IT FRIGHTEN YOU? I MERELY MEAN YOU CANNOT FIND HER. YOU KNOW WHAT A STATE SHE WAS IN WHEN THEY TOOK HER. HER CLOTHES WERE SO FILTHY I HAD TO BURN THEM. E. LEAVE THE POOR AND LEAVE MEALONE. I AM NOT LEAVING ANYTHING ALONE. AND I DON'T CARE WHAT I HAVE TO DO. (rings bell) (rings bell)MM-HMM. MMM. NO, I FIND NOTHING AT ALL PHYSICALLY WRONG, MISS FAIRLIE. I RATHER THINK THE SYMPTOMS YOU DESCRIBE MUST HAVE BELONGED TO SOME PASSIVE INFECTION WHICH TOOK A TOLL ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. I FEEL SURE THEY WILL NOT RETURN. YOU CAN PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON. DR. KIDSON, I ALSO WISH TO ASK YOU ABOUT A PATIENT WHO I THINK YOU WERE ONCE INVOLVED IN COMMITTING TO AN ASYLUM. A MISS ANNE CATHERICK. ANNE CATHERICK... YES... YES, VERY SAD. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS. I FEAR THAT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE, MISS FAIRLIE. ALL SUCH MATTERS ARE ENTIRELY CONFIDENTIAL. NOW, PLEASE, GO PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON. I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO KNOW. I FIND YOUR TONE RATHER OFFENSIVE. I'VE TOLD YOU, I CANNOT HELP. I HAVE OTHER PATIENTS TO SEE. I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME. YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME. AND IF YOU WALK OUT NOW I WILL SCREAM. WHAT? I WILL RUN AND SAY THAT YOU MADE DISGUSTING OVERTURES TO ME. HOW DARE YOU! I WILL SWEAR IT. YOU THINK THEY WILL BELIEVE YOU AGAINST ME? I AM HAPPY TO TAKE THAT RISK, ARE YOU? YOU CAN BE SURE THERE WOULD BE SCANDAL. I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU OR WITH THIS KIND OF BLACKMAIL. A MEDICAL EXAMINATION WILL QUICKLY REVEAL... YOUR HAIR ON ME. I TOOK IT FROM YOUR BRUSH IN THE CLOAKROOM. I WILL ALSO MAKE A PUBLIC APPEAL TO YOUR NEXT PATIENT WHO IS, I BELIEVE, THE DUCHESS OF NORFOLK. IF YOU DENY ME, I CAN CERTAINLY WOUND YOU, PERHAPS DESTROY YOU. AND I WANT NOTHING FROM YOU BUT INFORMATION WHICH CONCERNS ME. NOBODY NEED KNOW YOU HAVE PROVIDED IT. PLEASE PUT SOME CLOTHES ON. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU. I WANT TO KNOW HER HISTORY, AND ALSO WHERE SHE IS NOW. (coldly): SHE WAS MOVED TO A MORE SECURE ASYLUM AT TREGYLLIS IN CORNWALL. I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE HER RECAPTURE BUT I'M TOLD SHE'S OF NO USE TO ANYONE NOW. WHAT LITTLE MIND SHE HAD IS QUITE GONE. YOUR NAME'S FAIRLIE. ARE YOU RELATED TO PHILIP FAIRLIE OF LIMMERIDGE HOUSE? THAT WAS MY FATHER. AH. ARE YOU AWARE THAT ANNE'S MOTHER, JANE CATHERICK WORKED ON THE LIMMERIDGE ESTATE WHEN YOU WERE IN YOUR CRADLE? IT IS POSSIBLE. SHE CONCEIVED OUT OF WEDLOCK AND LATER, TO AVOID EMBARRASSMENT A JOB WAS FOUND FOR HER, BY YOUR FATHER, I BELIEVE. FAR AWAY ON THE ESTATE OF SOME FRIENDS, THE GLYDES. THAT WAS THE BACKGROUND TO ANNE'S BIRTH. WHEN SHE WAS 12, SHE CAME TO SEE ME BECAUSE SHE WAS MORALLY DEGRADED. QUITE BEYOND CONTROL. WHY? I DO NOT KNOW. MUCH WAS CONCEALED FROM ME, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HER MOTHER HAD BER HER SILENCE. BUT ANNE DIVULGED SOMETHING TO WHICH MAY SEEM SUGGESTIVE TO YOU. SHE HAD LEFT SOMETHING-- A LOCK OF HER HAIR-- IN YOUR FATHER'S GRAVE. NOW, WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT? I CANNOT THINK. NO? HMM... IT RATHER SEEMED TO ME THAT THE CATHERICKS HAD BEEN USED AS SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL RESOURCE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY TAKEN AFTER HIM YOURSELF. NOW, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD LEAVE AND NEVER RETURN. WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF YOUR CLASS YOU'D CERTAINLY BE ON THE STREETS YOURSELF... MOST PROBABLY IN THE GUTTER. (faltering): YOU THINK ANNE IS MY FATHER'S CHILD? Hartright: WE MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR FATHER DID NO GREATER WRONG THAN MANY MEN. YOU SHOULD NOT CONFUSE HIS SIN WITH WHAT WAS DONE TO LAURA. BUT HE WAS MY FATHER. PERHAPS HE STARTED A CHAIN, USING PEOPLE FOR WHAT HE WANTED AND I AM WHERE IT ENDS. I TOLD MYSELF IF I WAS ACTING WICKEDLY IT WAS FOR LAURA'S SAKE. NOW I SEE IT IS IN MY BLOOD. THAT IS NOT TRUE. ITISTRUE AND THE COUNT RECOGNIZED AS MUCH. I CANNOT GO ON. LISTEN TO ME. I DID NOTHING FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE MATTERED BUT LME NOW FOR HER SAKE. IF YOU TALK LIKE THIS, YOU LET THEM WIN. YOU ARE NOT GIVING UP, AND NOR AM I. THERE ARE TWO OF US NOW. WE WILL GO TO GILMORE TOGETHER. HE MUST. LAURA WOULD HAVE WISHED IT. VERY WELL. BUT FIRST WE MUST HELP ANNE. R MIND MAY BE GONE BUT FIRST WE MUST HELP ANNE.HE BUT IF WE FAILED LAURA, WE WILL NOT FAIL HER. ESPECIALLY IF SHE IS MY SISTER. Man: YOU SAID IN YOUR LETTER THAT YOU ARE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY. WE HAD BUSINESS IN FALMOUTH AND SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ASKED US TO SEE HER. YES, OF COURSE. WELL, IT WAS SIR PERCIVAL AS BROUGHT HER HERE IN JUNE. HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER. WELL, SOME ARE AND SOME AREN'T. THIS PLACE IS MORE COMFORTABLE THAN A PUBLIC ASYLUM, SIR. IT IS, AS YOU KNOW, ONLY FOR THOSE WHO CAN PAY THEIR WAY. ANNE CATHERICK GIVES US NO TROUBLE, AS YOU'LL SEE. MILD AS A LAMB. THOUGH THAT IS PARTLY WHAT SHE TAKES FOR THE DELUSIONS. LAUDANUM, SIR. DO YOU HAVE MANY VISITORS? THINK SO, SIR. DO YOU HAVE MANY VISITORS?LY MOST OF THEMS THAT ARE HERE ARE HERE A LONG TIME AND ARE WELL OUT OF SIGHT. AND OUT OF SIGHT IS OUT OF MIND, ISN'T IT, SIR? OUR DOCTOR VISITS AND DOES WHAT HE CAN BUT THEMS THAT COME HERE ARE NOT FOR CURING, I FEAR. NOT REALLY FOR CURING. (pigeons cooing) OH, I'VE JUST REMEMBERED: SIR PERCIVAL HAD THIS MESSAGE FOR YOU. FOR ME, SIR? Hartright: HE WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU'D HEARD FROM MRS. CATHERICK, ANNE'S MOTHER. Attendant: NO, SIR, I'VE NOT HEARD ANYTHING AND SIR PERCIVAL SAID I WOULD NOT... ANNE? ANNE. IT IS A FRIEND. LAURA! (weeping) OH, MY GOD IN HEAVEN! LAURA! Hartright: WE'LL SEE YOU ARE NOT BLAMED. AND FOR NOW, NOBODY NEED KNOW SHE HAS LEFT. IT IS A PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT, AND WE WISH TO REIMBURSE YOU FULLY FOR YOUR PART IN IT. BUT WHY? WHY? IT WAS ANNE CATHERICK WHO FELL. IT WAS ANNE CATHERICK WHO FELL. MUST HAVE BEEN. THEY LOCKED HER UP IN THE TOWER AND SHE THREW HERSELF TO HER DEATH. AND WE HAD GIVEN HER LAURA'S CLOTHES. SO THE DOCTOR ASSUMED ITWASLAURA; OOKED SO ALIKE. AND FOSCO NO LONGER NEEDED TO MURDER. HE HAD ALL HE WANTED-- THE LIFE OF ONE THE IDENTITY OF THE OTHER. THEN IT WAS ANNE WHO GAVE HER LIFE. (train rumbling on tracks) IT HAS BEEN HOURS. WHY DOES SHE NOT KNOW US? IT WILL TAKE TIME. YOU MUST SLEEP NOW. BUT WHAT IF HER MIND IS GONE FOREVER? LIKE ANNE? "A PHYSICAL RESOURCE." WHAT? IT WAS SOMETHING THE DOCTOR SAID. Marian: FATHER! Dr. Kidson: CONCEIVED OUT OF WEDLOCK. SHE CAME TO SEE ME BECAUSE SHE WAS MORALLY DEGRADED. ALMOST TOLD THE WOMEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME BECAUSE SHE WAS MORALLY DEGRADED.ANNE OF THE WILL MY FATHER MADE AT THE END AND I STILL CANNOT FIND WHERE SHE HAS HIDDEN IT. . AND I STILL CANNOT FIND WHERE SHE HAS HIDDEN IT.ECRET IT IS HIDDEN IN... Kidson: SHE HAD LEFT SOMETHING, A LOCK OF HER HAIR . Kidson: SHE HAD LEFT SOMETHING, A LOCK OF HER HAIR'S GRAVE NOW, WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT? (gasps) (breathing rapidly) I KNOW HE WAS HER FATHER AND I KNOW WHERE THE WILL IS HIDDEN. THIS PAINTING ALWAYS HAUNTED ME. THE STORY OF HOW THE ARTIST EXHUMED HER BODY. NOW I SEEWHY. IT IS IN MY FATHER'S GRAVE, WALTER-- WITH HER HAIR. THEY NEVER ALLOWED US TO SEE HIM AT THE END. HE WAS TOO ILL. (carriage approaching) (carriage receding) NO ONE. (shovel hits solid object) WE ARE THERE. LOOK! HER HAIR. AND YES, THE WILL. ANNE DID HIDE IT HERE. WHAT'S THAT? ALMOST IN SHREDS... BUT IT HAS WRITING. WE NEED MORE LIGHT. IT IS AS WE THOUGHT. THIS WILL STRIP GLYDE OF HIS TITLE AND ESTATE. IT WILL DESTROY HIM. "ANNE CATHERICK, AGED 12. "I HIDE THIS WILL... WITH A LOCK OF HAIR "IN THE... GRAVE OF ONE... WHO WAS KIND TO ME "AND... I KNOW TO BE MY FATHER." IT MAY YET TELL US WHY GLYDE WAS CUT OFF. (sighs heavily) GO ON. "BECAUSE THESE PAST MONTHS MY OWN SECRET IS I HAVE ONE WHO COMES TO MY BED AT NIGHT AS A HUSBAND." "MY HUSBAND, PERCIVAL." DEAR GOD, WALTER, A CHILD! WHAT DID THEY DO? (Hartright groans) I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR SO LONG AS YOU KNOW. SHE WAS 12 YEARS OLD. OH, THAT. IT IS ONLY THE RAVINGS OF A DISTURBED CHILD. Marian: A PHYSICAL RESOURCE. YES, THE CATHERICKS WERE THAT. FIRST THE MOTHER AND THEN THE CHILD. EVEN IN DEATH? Percival: YES. I HEARD YOU FOUND YOUR SISTER. IS SHE OF USE TO YOU NOW IN HER CONDITION? EVEN NOW YOU HAVE NO REMORSE. I WILL TELL YOU, SIR PERCIVAL, WHAT YOU ARE! YOU ARE A SHAM, A HOLLOW SHELL A FALSE THING. I NEEDED MONEY. I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO. IT IS OVER NOW. NO, IT IS NOT OVER AND IT WILL NEVER BE FORGIVEN. NO DEGREE OF SELF-INTEREST NO CIRCUMSTANCE, NOT EVEN IGNORANCE COULD EVER EXCUSE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO US. TO ME AND TO MY SISTERS. SO WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO? WRESTLE WITH ME? NO. IF YOU PUT YOURSELF SO LOW THEN I CANNOT SEE YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Percival: OPEN THIS DOOR! NOW! (door rattling violently) LET ME OUT! (straining) (Percival banging on door) Percival: LET ME OUT! (pounding door) MISS FAIRLIE! (Marian grunting, breathing heavily) (Percival yelling for Marian) MY GOD, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT. (groans groggily) Percival: HELP ME! HELP ME! PLEASE! MARIAN! FORGIVE ME! FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME... MARIAN, ARE YOU MAD? COME AWAY! (screams) (explosion) IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. AND THAT IS HOW IT WILL BE SEEN. (exhales deeply) Laura (shakily): MISTER... M... MISTER... HART... ...RIGHT. (sobbing in delight) MARIAN! MARIAN! Laura: MARIAN? LAURA. Fairlie: ALLOW ME TO PRESENT MR. HARTRIGHT-- WHO WAS WRONGFULLY ACCUSED. GREAT WHO WAN INVALID AS EVERSED. AS BUT HE INTIMATED I MUST BE HERE AND HE IS SO VERY OBLIGING AS TO SPEAK FOR ME. THE SUBJECT IS DREADFULLY EMBARRASSING. PLEASE HEAR HIM, AND PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A NOISE. (sniffs) ALL OF YOU WILL HAVE HEARD THAT A CONSPIRACY HAS BEEN UNMASKED WHICH LED TO THE WRONG WOMAN BEING BURIED IN THE CHURCHYARD HERE AND LADY GLYDE BEING MISTAKENLY IMPRISONED. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO CELEBRATE THE RETURN TO LIMMERIDGE OF LADY GLYDE WHO IS ALMOST RESTORED TO FULL HEALTH AND MY OWN ENGAGEMENT TO HER. (crowd exclaiming and applauding) CONGRATULATIONS. Man: MARVELOUS NEWS. (chisel hitting stone) Marian: AND SO IN MY DREAMS I OFTEN FIND MYSELF BACK IN LIMMERIDGE CHURCHYARD IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH WHICH IS NOW ONLY A BARE SHELL. AND I STAND THINKING NGED THE LETTERS ANDON THE GRAVE--INGHEY CHA THE GRAVE THAT WAS NO LONGER OF MY SISTER LAURA BUT OF A CHILD WHO WAS SHUT AWAY FOR LIFE BECAUSE A MAN HAD ABUSED HER. OF COURSE, EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED NOW. WE LIVE A DIFFERENT LIFE SETTING OUR FACES BRAVELY FORWARD TREADING CAREFULLY AROUND THE BUT I CAN NEVER FORGET THE CRUEL CYCLE THAT BEGAN SO LONG AGO WITH THE BIRTH OF AN UNWANTED CHILD. AND I HAVE ONE WAKING PRAYER. AH! (sighs) LET IT BE OVER.
