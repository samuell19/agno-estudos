My father escaped with you all and was chased after. Luckily. he met your teacher and together they fought back During the fight your eldest and second brother were somehow separated My father entrusted you to your teacher Your third and fifth brother were entrusted to the chiefs of two clans to raise them up discreetly so when you all grow up you could avenge your father I am an orphan then My father made a cut on the left arm of each of you When you brothers put your arms together it will form a continuous scar Miss Yan, there's something I still don't understand You're headed for Flying Dragon villa to Long Zhen Feng suspected that it was my father who helped you all to escape On the surface, he seemed to be my dad's friend, but in fact he wanted to find the whereabouts of you all Since my father's death he even took great care of me He's in fact keeping a close watch on me This time he's sending someone with me to the villa I see So where are my brothers?

The elder & 2nd brother's whereabouts are still unknown Can't say for how long would I still have to wait I'm anxious for revenge There's a lot of martial experts in there, it's risky I must avenge my father & dismiss other considerations Then you should take the cue and act accordingly Say, if you are no match, head for the Long Snake Mount temple & await your 3rd brother Alright, thank you Miss Brother Gao Zi Yang Town is the only route You have wounded the men of Flying Dragon villa they will surely wait for you in there You'd better take the short cut & go past Zi Yang Town Alright, thank you What a rash guy Blacksmith Gao, our butler is here What can I do for you?

Miss, what do you mean? Naturally I have good reason to advise you to cancel your trip to Flying Dragon villa They do all the evil deeds why are you interceding on their behalf? Why would I?

Long Zhen Feng is highly skilled in kung fu We were lucky to be able to escape When can we avenge father? What's the big deal, I can fight him Brother, if only we could fight till the death with him Who's afraid of death? But he's so highly skilled in kung fu I'm afraid that even with the five of us together we are no match for him No, if all five of you are here you can fight against him That rascal's kung fu is too good to find a match Not difficult at all In order to help you avenge your father, my late father travelled a lot and got a secret manual As long as you five can unite to accomplish its kung fu you can kill Long Zhen Feng What kind of kung fu is it? It's called Five Tigers with one heart Take it and read it Second brother 5 tigers with one heart it'll be invincible" This style of kung fu requires five persons to practise and one of them must have great physical power which can lift up heavy weight That one of course is me Miss Yan, what kind of kung fu is it? Never heard of it After accomplishing the skills you will become one like a giant with unlimited power Only when five people are united in spirit can this style of kung fu be accomplished Wait until you brothers get together then you can start practising I'm going to look for Gao Shia You stay here to rest and recuperate Before I come back, don't go out Alright, Miss Yan we'll wait for your return I wonder when third brother will be here The appointment should be on June 15 I suppose he should be on his way Yong Sheng..
