Our relationship started from an order. Ever since I saw you, I knew you were different from anyone else. But I was not brave. Not brave enough to stand by you. Who can tell me what planet we live on? Earth That's right. Earth is a planet Planets rotate around stars So, our sun is a star Ms. Lee, here's the new transfer student All right, thank you Everybody, this is the new transfer student from Taipei Let's give her a warm welcome You can sit over there for now We'll ask her to introduce herself later Ok, back to class Besides stars and planets, there is also the comet Every time a comet visits our solar system, it brings unexpected surprises When a comet visits, it usually brings a beautiful spectacle what we call, shooting stars And what do we do when we see a shooting star? Jonathan, have you ever been to Taipei? Hush That's right, we make a wish We wish for mommy and daddy's health or to become a good student Everyone can make his own wish Remember that Shane Yu, what are you doing? Both of you, stand up! The rabbit hops and hops... then it runs off and disappears... Ia la la la la la la The rabbit... Stop stop stop! Stop looking outside Shane Yu scared the new student so much that her family decided to transfer again If you don't behave, you will be punished too like Shane Stop looking outside Let's repeat the song 3 2 1 sing! The rabbit hops and hops... then it runs off and disappears... The rabbit boasts... I'm the fastest... He's very naughty and gets into trouble all the time I sent him to see the doctors before The doctor suggested that if he can pair up with another student, it will help to modify his behavior and he won't feel like making trouble all the time Everybody stand! Attention! Salute!
