Don't turn me into a bitch, Auntie. You need to be treated for diabetes. You can't be begging in the street. You could have asked me for help. I don't need your money. Why? Because it's stolen? It's me. They're here. Here's where you've been hiding. I've been looking foryou everywhere. Aren't you that loser who was eating Chinese noodles? What the hell do you want? Why else would a cop be here? Lieutenant Oh is my superior officer. Give us a break, Detective. We're just trying to make a living. You must be the Myeongdong boss. You could have told us you were a detective. Can you see with that eye? Be careful. You'll break an arm. Wait! Go easy on those guys! We have to take this secret to our graves. Let's put the past behind us. We'll make a great team. Only if you promise not to stab us in the back again. Do we get the same amount we talked about? Yes. We'll give 30 million in cash to the five elders in your gang. You stole all of these. Don't think you can lie to me. I swear I'm not lying to you. Ljust can't rememberthem all. You can't remember because you stole from so many people? Too many to remember... No! Don't write that in! Is this your address? Dohwadong 223? I... I... We got Myeongdong. Let's start with Dongdaemun. Yes, Boss. We got here without a fight. Bless this food we're about to eat! Look at this crowd! I can barely move! Does this come in any other color? No. Just that one. What about the size? Is this all you've got? I don't think I like the design. I'm going to the bathroom. Don't touch the money. Terajima? How is it looking in Tokyo? Yes. Get everything ready. Don't forget the money. I'll have to call you back. Jang-mi? Are you going to Japan soon? I didn't know you spoke Japanese. I studied it a little to pass the time in prison. I hope you're not thinking of leaving us. Of course not. By the way, I heard you bought land on Kanghwa Island. I hope you're not stealing from me. Don't be ridiculous. You know I wouldn't do that. Take it. Use it to pay foryour grandfather's service. You don't have to do this. We're fine. I've never done anything for him. Take it. Give that dirty money back to her right now! We can't use that filthy money over our grandfather's grave. Dae-young! Don't do this! Take it, Su-hyeon. Don't! Take it! At least let me do my duty as a daughter! Get out! Dae-young! She's our mother! Don't do that to her! She's our mother! What's happening to her? She wasn't like this before! When did this happen? Suddenly curious, are you? Because she's your daughter? She hung herself the day she found out you were a pickpocket. Don't come back. The second you step through my door, we're all dead. She's called Pig Lady. She comes from Pusan. She gets her diamonds polished and set on Sundays when stores are closed. I heard she's coming this week. I need you to get that for me. Those rocks would be worth about 800 million. Pig Lady's in. Get ready. The Twins are behind you. Be careful. How did Jang-mi find out about Pig Lady? We need to get those rocks. Our lives depend on this. Yes, Boss. Get ready, Yong-su. I already told you! He left hours ago! Forget it! I'm hanging up! You thought you'd get something out of this? These are all fake! What? I know betterthan to trust smuggled stuff, but I thought I could trust them because they came from Man-bok. Sir, I really have to go upstairs. You're the asshole who begged me to get those off my hands. Asshole? Did you just call me an asshole? You heard me. Asshole. Move! I have to go! How can Yadang betray us? How can they work with Jang-mi? Does this look like the right time to be chowing on noodles? Hello? Mr. Han? Yes? I see. I'll see you at your law offices. Boys. Yong-taek is being released on bail. What? Really? How does that feel? Great. Your muscles are all tense. That's because you kept refusing to meet with me. Give me those sweet lips, Ji-hee. Hey! Yong-su. I hearyou're working forthat bitch Jang-mi now. You turned my brother into a cripple. Are you really that good with the razor? Are you? I'm really sorry... I'm sorry... Such pretty hands... I'm not surprised... A good pickpocket needs to have pretty hands. Although, what the fuck happened to your pinky? Don't do this... Please... Tell Jang-mi and your Antenna. Give Dongdaemun and Myeongdong back to us if you don't want a slow death. I've known him for a while. I met him while I was there to buy this. I see. What were you whispering about? I asked him if he was working in Myeongdong, but he wasn't. I was only trying to help you. You came here all alone in the middle of the night. Was there something else you wanted to say to me? Actually, I'm done talking to you. I have something to show you. It's Indian ink. It's the color of midnight. You can't make a tattoo even with all the inks in the world unless you have this. You need it to make the lines. I made these myself foryou. I thought you might like them. I'm a cop. I don't need tattoos. It's the Thousand Hands Sutra. It has 1,000 hands and 1,000 eyes. It can see the pain of mankind through its eyes, and it uses its thousand hands to rescue us from our pain. Your eyes are full of sorrow. Auntie Man-ok? This is delicious. Where'd you learn to do this? I have you to thank. I was a prison chef for 20 years. We've known each otherfor a long time. It must be fate. I wouldn't call it fate. I'd call it a twist of fate. It's up to you to break the bad karma. This is to congratulate you on your store opening. All it needs is a little water. Let me read your palm. Your luck is going to come to you in your lateryears, Auntie. Dae-young's grown up to be a fine young man. Thank you forthe food. I should call you Mrs. Cho from now on. I knew this was going to happen. This is why I never work with women. Yong-taek is out of prison. What are we going to do? I'll go overthere right now. I'll kill all those sons of bitches. Don't be so hasty to jump into anything. That's when things go to hell. That's how Korea went to hell. The police are afteryou, so you in particular have to lie low. You seem to have found out a lot in just one night. What are you doing? Are we giving up the gang? Let's talk tomorrow. We're done here. That's it. Thank you. - Thank you. Come again. - The Twins are threatening to come after me now. We could lose everything if we give up our turf to them. You need to secure Myeongdong. Mom. Come home for grandpa's service. I'll talk to Dae-young. He'll be fine. It's his birthday that day, so you really have to come. I heard this place has the best hagfish. It's really good, Auntie. Yong-taek got to Yong-su. He can't use his hand anymore. I really need your help. Just this once. In fact, I'm leaving forJapan afterthis is over. I already gave the money to the guys at Yadang. If I don't do this job, I'll go broke. Do you want me to lose my wrist, too? Motherfucker! I didn't take care of you forthe last 7 years for nothing. Why won't you help me out? Is this about your cop son? What? What did you say? Is this because your son is a cop? You know I don't have a son. He's really something. No wonder he's your son. He's great in bed, too. You can give it back to him. He left it at my place. No. You must be joking. My son would never do that. Are you sure? After all, he's a guy, too. They're all the same. Did you know? He has a burn mark on his shoulder. He burned himself when he was little. Fuck! Fuck you, Jang-mi! I'll kill you! Calm down. I learned this from you. You slept with quite a few cops in your day. You ruined their lives. This doesn't have to be hard. I'm asking you to help me once. You. Me. Your son. We'll all be happy. Don't tell your son I gave you the money to start up this place. He's got quite the temper. We don't want to cross him. I knew Jang-mi was up to no good. The Japanese authorities just sent word that Jang-mi took part in the heist. The Yakuza is refusing to say anything. To protect her. We'll have to bring her in. I used this little toy of mine to fuck Jang-mi's little hole. She had the tightest pussy ever. Get up. Work is work and revenge is revenge, but ljust couldn't forget the taste of that sweet pussy. I'm here for a little reunion. Baek Jang-mi. You and I are in the same boat now. We both have to take this to our graves. Hello? Terajima? There's been a slight change in plans. You'll have to hurry. She's not coming. I knew it. She will! I said so! Jang-mi. It's only fortoday. That's the deal. What are you waiting for? Aren't you going after her? Lieutenant Oh. It's me. Baek Jang-mi says a gang is planning an operation in Myeongdong today. We can't trust her, but we still have to move on this. Let's do our best. Pay close attention. I don't want you boys getting hurt while going afterthose guys. Yes, sir. They're here. Auntie! Run! Stop it! Help! Kang Man-ok. Here we are again. And you thought you could be a mother? Not anyone can be a mom. Certainly not you. Do you miss the glory days? Now that you're old and sick? Is that why you're back to doing this? Auntie! Are you out of your mind? Let go! You'll get yourself killed! - Don't hurt my son... - Let go! Let go! You'll Die. Let go! Die. Dae-young! Stop! Hey! Stop! Detective! - Dae-young? Are you okay? - Dae-young? Are you okay? Mrs. Cho! Mrs. Cho! Wait here. Wait here. We need an ambulance! Quick! I'm sorry... I'm sorry... This is a news update. A WAIS detective was injured while trying to arrest pickpockets near a Myeongdong shopping mall at 9 p.m. Yesterday. He was stabbed by a knife wielded by Choi, a member of the gang. Another member, Kang, was killed on the scene by Choi. Choi was shot while trying to flee. He's undergoing surgery now. The police have issued a warrant for the arrest of Baek, who is thought to have been behind the operation. I'm a victim, too! I'm a victim! Shut up! You're not making any sense. Where is Baek Jang-mi? I told you I don't know. She betrayed me, too. I've been trying to find her. She must have turned invisible or something. No one knows where she is. Dae-young. This is from Lieutenant Oh. He said he found it with mom's things. She must have wanted to give it to you on your birthday. Mom! Bring me back a watch! Don't forget my watch! Dae-young? What is it? Where did they find it? A crane operatorfound it in the river while dredging mud to use in a construction project. Are you okay? Cause of death is loss of blood due to a wound in the carotid artery. There's one strange thing, though. I found traces of titanium and Indian ink nearthe wound. It's Indian ink. It's the color of midnight. - What? - You were right. I checked Suyeongman Dock like you said. There are three yachts leaving for Osaka this afternoon. It's my yacht operating license. I got it in Osaka. Don't I look pretty in this picture? One's registered under a Japanese. The owner's name is Terajima. What do you want with a yacht anyway? What's going on? It took me a while to find a yacht you'd like. Thank you. And the money? It's in a private safe at the Citibank in Shinjuku. Thank you. I'll see you in Tokyo soon. Titanium and Indian ink were found on Hong Yong-taek's body. You know betterthan I do where those are used. Ljust wanted to live. What about Kang Man-ok? Did you use her so you could live? Is that it? Not everything goes as planned. I didn't expect that to happen. Is that why you came to me? So you could live? What do you want me to say? Every breath we take is a lie! Stop! Is anything going to change if I do? I'll end up with a life sentence. I don't want to die in jail. Either let me go, or end this right here. Baek Jang-mi. You're under arrest forthe crimes of pickpocketing and grand theft. Seong-su! Take this. And be careful. You too, Jang-mi. Let go of me! I told you it wasn't me! This isn't yourfirst time. You can't get out of this. You still haven't learned your lesson. I mean it. It wasn't me. How do you explain this? - I'm really sorry. - How many times has it been? I'm sorry. We can discuss this down at the police station. - I'm sorry. - Hurry up! Come on. I said I was sorry. You haven't learned your lesson yet. - I mean it. I'm sorry. - I said we can talk at the station. - Lieutenant? - We can talk there. Hey. Good job. Mom! Over here! Mom... Mom... Wake up...
