KHOM OH SHIT… A DRONE FLIES TOWARDS HER BALCONY. CUT TO KHOM, WHO'S PANICKING. KHOM OH SHIT… Shit, indeed. Damn it. I'm so out of ideas. KHOM OH SHIT… KHOM OH SHIT… Damn! You have been staring for days now. Your life can't end like this, Diew. Hey! Hey! That's it. Oh, great! This will be awesome. Are you Pawinee's family? Yes. Right. The patient needs medication. Bring this to pay at the cashier and get the medicine at the pharmacy, then bring it back here. You got that? Yes. - Just wait here a while. - Okay. Dr. Prakit Jongwilai, please come to the ER. Thank you. Yes… How much? Here. Thank you. My mom was admitted to the ICU three days ago because of her heart condition. It's so bad that she needs a ventilator this time. The doctor told me to be prepared for the fact that she might not make it to the new year. My mom is very old now, and she has many health conditions. I just want her to know that if she still wants to fight, I will also fight with… Shit! I forgot the idea I came up with. Here it is. It's coming. Coming… That's what she's gonna do? What the hell? Forgot again. Come on, script. Ideas… come to me! Ideas… come to me! Ideas… Damn it. Ideas didn't come, but chaos did. You won't take it? No sound alerts are allowed in front of the ICU. Don't you know anything? I'm sorry. Did you switch yours to silent mode? Yes. Do you have a phone? Switch them all to silent mode. You talked so loud earlier. Watch that. You have a phone? Switch it to silent mode. Quick. I know you never write scripts for love stories. But Tui has a faith in you. - It's okay if it takes a while. - Yes. He is looking forward to reading it. Yes. I… - Please tell him I'm sorry. - Okay. Yes. I'll send you the script soon. All right. Keep it up. Yes, thank you. Writing a romantic comedy in a depressing atmosphere… How is that gonna work? MANTRAS She is religious? I have seen people praying for their relatives. To be honest, I'm not sure if that works. Come on, just leave her alone. Keep writing. Keep writing. Keep writing. Then Khom made a precise decision. He called his best friend, Golf. He told him firmly… Ah, shit! Why are you chanting along with her? Damn, this isn't the time for hiccups. Stop. Stop it now. Oh shit! There! That always works. Oh? Who made that loud noise? My piano student always gets the hiccups. That's why I know how to fix it. Hey, you told me earlier about writing a romantic comedy script that gathers several stories in one movie. When you pitched the idea, how did you come up with it? Was it difficult? You'd have to cast many actors who are suitable for the roles, right? Which one should I answer first? And when you think of punchlines, how do you know which ones work and which don't? Damn… she changes questions so quickly. And the script you are thinking of, is it fun? Can I read it? Is that a good idea? How can I say no when she is fluttering her cute eyelashes? Yeah. You can. HAPPY ENDING - Hey. - Are you finished? No, I'm too lazy now. Can you just tell me the ending? I can't. Of course you can. I want to know how it ends. Please. Well, when you read a movie script, you have to take your time to understand the characters and the situation they are in. So you truly understand them. And my script… has four storylines in it. Just take it easy. Come on. There. She doesn't get it. Well, I should continue with my writing. Well, okay then. I'll keep reading. What's the password? I love you. Huh? - The password. "I love you." - I see. That's sweet. SOMEONE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE Go. Go. Go. What the hell? - Please eat chicken rice for me. - Huh? Take this one too. I'm only bringing my friend chicken rice. Hey. Hey. Follow her. I told you, I'm bringing chicken rice for my friend. That's right. My story started off out of nowhere, just like this. Only because I brought my friend chicken rice. Yes! Yes! Yes! I told you about gambling. Don't challenge me. I'm born for this. TRANSFER COMPLETE THB 1,000 Attaboy. We were just betting on how many free kicks, and you still got it. Damn, this is boring. - I'm gonna go. - Come on, one more match. How about throw-ins? Not interested. Corner kicks, then? - Corner kicks? - Yeah. Read my lips. Fucking Fatty. Why did you call me beautiful? I'm just… kind of cute. You know? Cutesy. You need help. Move. I'm gonna take off. I gave you a chance to make up. Damn you, Fatty. Are you off tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yeah. The Japanese programmers can't come. My company can't do anything. That's lame. Right. What? I bet you two crates of beer, you can't handle staying in for two weeks. Wanna bet? Shit. It has only been three days. I'm so losing this. The doctor will call me in for a checkup. If there's no infection, I don't have to stay in quarantine. I'll call you when I'm released, Dad. Bye. TEE CALL HISTORY, TEE TEE FUCKER TEE Fatty. Let me tell you this, you are losing this bet. I've unlocked a new power. Have you ever seen the first food delivery drone in Thailand? It's me. This very friend of yours. Oops. Shit. Oi! Hey. Hey, you. You… don't… Shit. You just went ahead and hit it! So crazy! Crazy how? The drone flew in out of nowhere. It could be from a pervert. Anyone would hit that. But shouldn't you check first? And you know what? The repairs will cost tens of thousands. Don't know. Don't care. Why do I have to pay for the repair? It's not my fault. Well, well, well. That is the face of an irresponsible person. Don't know, don't care. But I think she's cute. I'll talk to you later, Ice. Someone might be cursing me. Are you listening? Sure. Why are you smiling? Can I change the bet? I think we should level up this game. How? Hit on that girl across the building and win her over within 14 days. What do you say? Nah. Apart from the two crates of beer, I'll give you another 20,000 baht. Wanna bet? Nah. Hey. Mr. Kongkait. Since when were you such a pussy? Afraid of losing? That's lame. And my story begins here. You don't want to take him back? I'm done. It's been a year since I broke up with Tee. He still keeps calling me. Just let me move on, all right? Okay, okay, I get that. Yeah. When you are released from the hospital, let's have some chicken rice. Okay, okay. You can bring your boyfriend. I'd like to meet him. He is so damn mysterious. He is such a private person. He doesn't even take couple selfies. You better make sure that he only doesn't want to take pictures with you because he keeps his life private, and not because he is living a double life. Look at Tee. It came out eventually that he was seeing four other women. Damn. Shit! Why is it here again? What did you say? I'm not talking to you, it's that drone. Hey, gotta go now. If it were you, would you add Khom on Line? I would. First, I'd want to know what he had up his sleeve. Second, if we didn't get along, I'd just block him. Third, I'd want to forget my ex. This could be a way to deal with the situation. Not too easy, is it? Come on. It's the 5G era now. Just last year, my sister married someone she met on Tinder. - Yeah? - But they got divorced last month. - Oh? - Well… If it's the right person, it'll be right in every single way. If it's not, it'll end, and we go separate ways. Get it? I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. I COULDN'T CONTROL THE DRONE. HOME ISOLATION IS BORING. "EXTRACTION" IS A GOOD MOVIE. - SCARY? - NO, IT'S FUN. WANT A WALK TOMORROW? OFF TO BED NOW. Whoa. You've been chatting for three days. How did you pull it off? I'm good. In 14 days, you better prepare two crates of beer and my 20 grand. Asshole! Well, aren't you confident. Where are you going? Out to dinner. Where is it? Are the restaurants open for dining in? Can I come along? Khom. THE SNACK IS TASTY BUT THE GIVER IS TASTIER WANT TO GO WALK AROUND TOMORROW? HOW? WE NEED TO KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING. YOU'LL FIND OUT. Ready? What is this? I don't want to do this anymore. What? You know, the bet. I don't want it. Why? Afraid of losing? I'd win. Whoa, Khom. Just because she drew you a heart? Women do that. Don't be so vain. Come here. Huh? I'm being serious. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. I don't even know how she feels about me but I feel bad for lying to her. See? Can you imagine? If she knows the truth, it'll be upsetting. Besides, my girlfriend is coming back soon. She's okay now? Wait, Khom. Don't tell me that you are falling for the girl in the building across. Shit. What if your girlfriend finds out? Dunno. Hey. TRANSFER COMPLETE THB 20,000 What is it? Don't forget my two crates of beer. I won that game. But this one, I'm out. You've become a pussy all of a sudden. All right, I think you should take off. Why are you so into it? Get your shit together, dude. I'M LEAVING NOW. GOTTA SEE MY FRIEND FIRST. WANT SOMETHING TO EAT? I'LL BUY IT FOR YOU. Hey! Yes. Chicken rice party as promised. And I have a surprise for you. Well, I… knocked on the wrong door, sorry. How did you get here? Jing. We need to talk. What is it? Come in. You came at the right time. - I have chicken rice. - I have something to confess. I don't want to carry on like this. What happened between us… It was just a bet with my friend. A stupid bet. But so far between you and me, it's just superb. I feel like we are good friends and I don't want to lose a friend like you. But the truth is… I have a girlfriend. Hey. How did you get here? Jing. This is my surprise. My boyfriend lives in the same condo as you. Fuck! That's for my plot or… for Khom? - I meant you. - Huh? Why did you finish the story like this? Oh, well… Well, I don't like happy endings. None of us knows how our life will end. We don't always get a happy ending, right? Okay, George. Ah, yes, bro. I'll send you the file soon. Hey. - What is it? - I want to read more. - Here. - What's the next story? Is it about teenagers? Movies these days must be about teenagers so they make money, right? Hey. Why do you ask so much? Just read it. Well, why don't you tell me the ending? Come on. I'm joking. Why don't we find a place to sit down and read? SOMEONE NEXT DOOR BANGKOK PITTAYAMONTREE SCHOOL STUDENT OF THE YEAR, 2021 This girl is Chayen, known as the ice queen. Seeing her face really annoys me. Why? I just feel like we come from different worlds. Hey, Ter! Will you pass us the ball? Shit… Luckily, the teacher, Somchai, is okay, and the school gate can be fixed. If there had been more damage, how could you have covered the expense? Teeradet. Fifty points will be deducted from your behavior score. - Come on. - "Come on"?! You want another punishment? You can be Mr. Somchai's teaching aid for a month. Do you have to call in my parents? Call in your parents? Whoa, teacher. Who'd hit a student these days? "Who'd hit a student these days?" Me. What is it with you? You bring me embarrassment every day. - Such a bad son. Here. Here. - Ouch. Shit. What the hell? I meant well. Never know an honor student could give the middle finger. - Yeah? How? - Like this. - Oops. - Here. Are you sneaking here smoking again? And you gave me the middle finger too. Come here, I'll slap your middle finger off. - Calm down, Mom. - Come here. Damn, you saw her taking off her top? - It must be so magical. - It was okay. What do you mean, "okay"? It's the ice queen. Hey. Hey. What is it? There. I think she's kinda cute. It's just that she doesn't smile much. You are so lucky, living next door to her. - More like unlucky. - How? Ter. Bring this yellow curry to our neighbor. Ter, bring the mango to our neighbor. Ter, go and change the light bulb for them. How did you fail six subjects at school? I got four last year. And this year, I got six. Isn't that cool? You think it's cool, but I'm embarrassed both as a teacher and as your mom. Look at your friend next door. She is an honor student every year. And really, what happened to your nose? I'm a man. A real man always has wounds. Come. I can help with giving you more manly wounds. Where are you going? Come back. Really? - That sounds depressing. - Understand me now? I wish the ice queen would disappear. Disappear to where? Anywhere that is not next door. Hey, teacher. We brought them all here. Umm. Great. Why did you bring them here? I told you to bring them to the gym, not to the assembly hall here. Bring them to the gym. You never listen. Oh well. - Goodbye, teacher. - Goodbye. Get home safe, everyone. What are you looking at? She's gone. Where? Well, to study abroad in China. Aren't you in the same class? How come you don't know? CONGRATULATIONS! STUDENT OF THE YEAR, 2021 It's strange. When the ice queen is not around, I just don't feel right. Hey, teacher. - Where is your motorbike? - It's still at the repair shop. Here, someone wants you to have this. What is it? Don't you know what a WeChat ID is? Yeah, but whose ID is this? Add it and you'll know. I shouldn't have lived near you. Hungry. And I found out that night whose WeChat ID it was. Hello. Hello. Well… I need some help. I've been here for three months. My dad won't have been home much. There's just Tan, the housekeeper. I'm worried that my grandma will be lonely. Can you do me a favor? What is it? Can you drop off something nice for her and talk to her? I'll send you my grandma's favorites and wire you the money. Easy-peasy. Who the hell are you? It gets difficult when her grandma starts getting Alzheimer's. You like scary movies? Hello? Hello? Shit! Scared? No, Grandma. This is nothing. Shit! BLOOD DRAWING ROOM Chayen likes the taro filling. She says it's sweet. When she comes back, I'll make it for her until she gets chubby. Who the hell are you? What? I always take this route back from school. There is a market with a lot of snacks. Would you like anything? I'll get back in two weeks. Umm. Anything. Anything is kinda difficult. Hey, I talked to my grandma the other day. Thank you for everything you do. I'll bring you some souvenirs. Hey. Ter. Hey. The ice queen is not icy at heart. Her smile melts my heart. You really took your time. I'm always late because of you. The Chinese government has announced that they will lock down Shanghai to contain the virus and stop the spread of COVID-19. CHINESE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES LOCKDOWN TO CONTAIN CORONAVIRUS Mom. Hmm? Why do you love Dad? What's wrong with you? What an odd question. You told me that when dad hit on you, you hated him so much. Your dad had some qualities that others don't. And they were…? Your dad made good Pad Thai. Oh… "Oh" what? Actually, love comes from the little things that we do for each other every day. The love that is over the top and overly sweet romantic love like you see in movies? Fake. So you fall in love with Dad? - I hated him even more. - Whoa. Why are you surprised? Well, your dad made me love him, and then he went around selling insurance. I didn't see him much in the year. Not long after you were born, he happened to die. How can I not hate him? Well, that's love. You don't have to hide it. Every woman in the whole universe is good at hiding. How about you? Have you made any woman hate you? Does this count as hate? How is it going? I'm okay. I only stay in my room and can only use the internet sometimes. But at least they provide us with survival packs. The embassy has informed us that if we're lucky, there might be a flight home next week. Really? But I'm not sure if I'll get to go back… or when I'll go back. I've never missed home like this before. Please take care of my grandma. No. She's your grandma. You come back to look after her. Why are you saying this? Well… well… Then you'll get to come back soon. What are you smiling about? Nothing. It's strange. We lived next door for a long time but we've never talked this much. It's not strange. You and I… we live in different worlds. That's true. Well… when I get back, can I ask you something? Of course. What do you want to know? Can I… Oh, hey. Damn. Why is it frozen now? Damn. Can I come to your world? We are bringing you the meal. Oh. Okay. - Sick bastard. - Picking on me again. Don't look puzzled. I meant you. There. Well… Why are you mad at me? Why do you always write the ending like it's unfinished? Did Chayen make it back home? Does Ter ever find out that Chayen is into him? Will they get together? What happens after this? Why do you write crappy endings? Hey. I don't know in what way it's crappy. I think open endings are good. It's up to the viewer's interpretation. Your movie is gonna flop. What? Actually, you can stop reading so you'll stop criticizing. Don't be so paranoid. I might like your next story. But I'll say so again if I don't like it. SOMEONE YOU HATE Have you ever hated someone's guts even though you've never seen their face? This is the one I'm talking about. It's not because they're working for a rival company. It's because I see them all the time. Either this intersection or the next. I've raced with them many times. Two losses, one win. That's our score. Today, we'll race again. Dad will get mad if he sees that. Don't let him see then. - What? - Bribe me. - Here. - I don't like green. I prefer the red ones. Whoa. Just take a blue one. I need to save up for motorbike repairs. I've told you many times. You are a girl. Why don't you play with dolls? Dolls are for ordinary girls. I'm extraordinary. - Says who? - Says me. I'll build a rocket when I grow up. A rocket that can take me anywhere. What are you smiling at? You always make a stupid face, Aod. Oh? - I'm your brother. How could you…? - Ouch. Aod, when will Dad come home? While he is sleeping, do you think he has dreams? Dunno. Maybe he does. I hope you have a nice dream that you make a lot of money from driving a taxi. Don't forget to dream about Ing and Aod. MEDICAL BILL 54,508 BAHT I thought you'd quit racing and gone back to studying and had become a delivery man. COVID messed you up? Can't cope with the new normal? Don't waste your time talking. Prepare to lose your gold, bro. Just look at my ride. It's just been modified. - Smooth, right? - Where do you want your funeral held? Any temple with beautiful decorations. Bastard. Shit. Daddy is here. Shit. Daddy is here. - Your dad is a policeman? - My mom likes a man in a uniform. Bastard! Let's go. - Bro, how about my gold? - Come get it tomorrow. Hey, Peud. What's wrong? Come on. Don't die on me now. Shit. At that second, I thought I'd go to jail. But they turned up. Yes. That person. Hey! Stop! Stop right there! What should I say? I don't want to say thank you. I've always imagined what that bastard must look like under that helmet. Don't you know how to say thank you? Thank you. - You don't have to. - What? I'm not done with you. I don't want you to get arrested. That's all. Damn, even her shrug is cute. What do I do now? Wanna get something to eat? Eh? There's the way. How did you know I like this flavor? I know more than that. You'll die tomorrow. What? I said, tomorrow you'll die. Huh? How do you know? - Are you a fortune teller? - No. I'm from the future. - Don't believe me, do you? - Nah. I'd be dumb to. But it's true. Tomorrow, if you go racing, you will be munched like Cocoa Crunch. Thank you so much, Chut, for my motorbike. Thank you, sir. Ing, let's go upstairs. Come on. I have come a long way to see you. Don't disappoint me. Who is she? Is she from the future, or is it just a prank? But the present here is so real. 54,508 BAHT I think you are so kind to be my sponsor. Tomorrow, you'll die. How could you get it? I'm glad to see you here. Take it. Though I have enough money, I don't know if my dad will recover. Stop complaining. You don't know the future like I do. And quit making that stupid face. Aren't you going to see your dad? Oh, yeah. Wait up. So who are you? You dolt. Don't you remember? I'll build a rocket when I grow up. A rocket that takes me anywhere. You go for sci-fi? Yeah. You think it's over the top? I don't know. But… if someone really came from the future… and told me what was going to happen, that would be nice. And… if it's bad news? Well, good news or bad news, at least you don't have to wait in the unknown and get drowned with hope or fear day by day. That's more traumatizing. Visiting hours for in-patients and emergency patients are over. Relatives can visit tomorrow during visiting hours. Thank you. Hey. Thanks for the drink. No worries. A trade for your movie script. Hey. Hmm? I never asked you. Who are you visiting here? My boyfriend. Bye-bye. SOME SECRET ADMIRER 35,7 Tom. - What? - Is 33,2 considered a fever? I don't think so. But I think you're dead. How can someone's temperature be 33 degrees Celsius? The thermometer must be broken, Hoodlum. This guy is Suer. It means "tiger," but he's a wuss. He is a man of determination. Determination to line up water bottles. The brand must align. To find ticks on dogs. To memorize the clients' names. Hello, Mr. Noo. Would you like some sausages? Hi, Mr. Pom. How are you? Hey, Mr. Tu. Nice shirt. So sleepy. How come Joom never assigns me a morning shift? That's good. You don't have to go out drinking. What's wrong with drinking? Drinking is not bad, but being drunk is. You ask for trouble when you are drunk. I like it. I like night shifts. Not as many clients. It's cooler. I get to play with the dog. Really, Suer? I don't think those are the reasons. What are you talking about? Hi. That's the reason. Hey. What should I get for the doc? How about this? So spicy that it'll wake him up. - He should like it. - I see. Thank you. The only thing that Suer is never determined about is telling his crush how he feels. See you later. I'm going, Hoodlum. Bye. He has a crush on her, but she has a crush on the dentist. She leaves stuff for him in the fridge every day. FOR DR. NOOM Club Friday stuff. What does this dentist look like? How do you know that the dental clinic is still open? They close at 9:00 p.m. How do you know that that dentist is still here? He goes home 8:30 p.m. Whoa. You have done some homework, haven't you? So, do you have a crush on the nurse or the dentist? - Take painkillers only when it hurts. - Where is he? - The next appointment is next week. - Yes. - Thanks so much. - Goodbye. Whoa. He's so ugly. Even I look better. What is it? Over there. He is a doctor. You are a dog. You don't have a chance, Suer. You are degraded to just a cat. - What are you looking at? - Piss off. Looking for dental care? Yes… a bit of toothache. Which one? I don't know. Ask him. Umm. You have a severe cavity. You need fillings. Be cautious about COVID. I'll clean up the infected area and we'll have an appointment for fillings later. I'll give you an anesthetic shot. What is it? Huh? What did you say? He asked if it'll hurt. Oh, not at all. You won't feel a thing. - Come on. - Ouch. No. "Can we do it later?" Let's do it now. It won't hurt much. You'll be fine. Come on. You said it won't hurt. Did I say it wouldn't hurt? I don't remember that. - Just a bit. - No. - Like an ant's bite. - No. - Just a bit. - No. - It'll hurt a bit and then you'll be fine. - Get out. Ouch. Doctor. - Can you get up? - Yeah, I'm fine. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I'm okay. Come on. Hey. Nurse, do you see the syringe? Ah. That's all right. We'll get a new one. How's the script so far? I like that he is determined. Try and play with his determination. I think desperate guys are cute. Right. Are you Kawin's relative? Yes. The doctor wants to talk to you. Come with me. Yes. We'll talk later. She said we'd talk later. I also wanted to talk to her. But after that, I didn't see her for days. HAPPY NEW YEAR, 2023 I still remember what you told me I'm still overwhelmed Just thinking about it It rains over there, the chills reach here I still want to hear everything Do you still go to bed late? Did you lose weight? Don't forget to share it with me Well, I haven't seen you for days, so I thought that your boyfriend had been released. Oh, he hasn't been. I went around to make merit for him. I see. I went everywhere my friends said was a holy place. - Yeah. - There was a temple… The bread for fish looked yummy. I tried it. It tasted kinda nice. I actually didn't spend that much time doing that. The rest, I… spent packing up my boyfriend's stuff. Well… When the doctor called me in, he said that… my boyfriend doesn't have much time left. Come on. I'm okay. So what's the rest of your movie script? DENTISTRY Whoa. Just because she likes a dentist, you're trying to become one? Isn't that wishful thinking? I gotta try. But there are some things you're just destined to end up failing. By the time you are accepted and you graduate, she'll be bringing her kids to you for dental care. Right, Hoodlum? Hey. He knows that the snacks in the fridge are mine. THANKS FOR THE SNACKS FROM DR. NOOM Does he? How is it going then? So he… invited me for a dinner at his condo. That's nice, right? Umm, that's nice. That's all I wanted to tell you. I gotta get back to work. See ya. Bye. "At his condo." I don't think it's just dinner, Suer. Just admit it. Let's find a new crush. DENTISTRY SEVERAL DAYS LATER Hey. What happened to you? I went out drinking the other night and fought with a bunch of pricks. I told them to meet after we closed. Because I know that we're open 24 hours a day. But damn it, I forgot that we have to close after 10:00 p.m. They were waiting behind our shop. So punctual. All standing there like boy band members. Don't make me talk so much. - It hurts. - I didn't make you talk. You'd better take some medicine. What is it? He has a girlfriend. I saw them together. That day at his condo… he might just… I'm so stupid. I've just realized how hurtful it is to be played. But it's not as hurtful as when I saw him throw away the snacks. DENTISTRY Do you need dental care? Oh, God! No! Please calm down. Security! Anybody? Security! I think that was Suer's determination to show her his love. But afterward, Ja never came by again. She resigned and moved back to Chiang Mai. Rumor has it that she had a child without getting married to anyone. As for Suer, he resigned soon after that. Nobody knows where he went. But I believe that he must be determined to do something, somewhere. CHIANG MAI Where have you been? Did you play games until the battery died? No. If you don't cry today, I'll buy you two ice creams. - Good. - Very good. Next patient. You can see the doctor now. Let's go. Let me pick up my stuff. Mek, is it? Umm, five years old. Have you brought him here for dental care before? Hello. Hello. DENTISTRY Really? - A dentist? - Well… Wh… why? You told me to play with his determination. So, here. And in real life, even a garbageman can be a pilot. Why? Is the script not good? You don't like it? Of course I do. I like this ending. See? You can write a story with a happy ending. It's cute. Well… I actually don't know how to write these kinds of things. But it's because… Because of what? Because… - Because… - Hey. The patient woke up. It's you, boy. Your mom woke up. Seems like she wants to see you. Yes. Go ahead. The lab results show improvement. We can remove the ventilator tomorrow. - Thank you so much, doctor. - Congratulations. Thank you. I'm so happy that your mom is recovering. You see? Actually, our lives can have happy endings. I'll watch your movie at the cinema. I had no idea that when I got to talk to my mom again would be the same time that Bua had to say goodbye to her boyfriend. My mom remained in the ICU for another two weeks. Then, she spent two months in a regular ward. I never saw Bua again. Every day I visit my mother, I think of her. I wonder where she is and what she is doing. I hope her tears dried out. And I hope that she misses me too. Hey, you! You… don't… Shit. How may I help you? Love Distancing, screening at 7:30 p.m. The 7:30 p.m. session has already started. How about the one at 8:30? 8:30… 8:30… - You just went ahead and hit it! So crazy! - Crazy how? The drone flew in out of nowhere. It could be from a pervert. Anyone would hit that. 10:30 to 11:00? - Right? - But shouldn't you check first? And you know what? The repairs will cost tens of thousands. Don't know. Don't care. It's all right. Thank you. Oh, hello. Yes, Bas. Right. I'm watching my movie. - Then I'll take 8:30 p.m. - All right. I want to see the audience's reaction. Yes. Okay. I see. Really? Thank you so much. Yes. Yes. What are you doing here? I'm here to watch your movie. At that moment, I felt like a happy ending feels really good. Hello. Hello. IN REMEMBRANCE OF PAWINEE AMARUJI
