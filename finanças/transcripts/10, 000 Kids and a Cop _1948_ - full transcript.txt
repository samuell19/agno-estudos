"10,000 Kids and a Cop" came to be because we had a baby brother who passed away... Drowned when he was a year old. And Dad wanted to... He loved children, and he wanted something good to come out of that baby's early demise. And so he bought some property in Los Angeles... downtown L.A. And he wanted to give something to the community. He wanted kids who were disadvantaged to be able to have the things that he thought all kids should have... Play facilities, swimming, arts, crafts, sports... And put together... Built this wonderful foundation, youth foundation, you know, in Los Angeles. And it'll be open for all those poor kids down there. They're gonna have a 40-by-80 swimming pool and a clinic and basketball courts and handball courts and everything that you'd like to have. "10,000 Kids and a Cop" came to be as a way of letting the public know what was going on. And William Bendix was in it and Jimmy Stewart. It was like a tribute, actually, to the center and to our brother. And I think it made Dad very proud to know that he could, in Lou Jr.'s name, do something for the kids of Los Angeles. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm privileged to introduce to you this most important picture. It was filmed entirely in the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation in Los Angeles. I'm sure that the message contained in these reels will bring the same warm response to the hearts of every mother and father, as it has brought to all of us here in Hollywood. Hello, Officer Powell. Hello, Mike. Getting ready to close up? Yeah, it will be all closed up in a few minutes. You know this place certainly has changed this neighborhood. It's almost like Peaceful Valley around here now. It certainly made a difference. Here's the key, Mr. Mike. Good night, Mr. Mike. - Good night, boys. - See ya tomorrow. And thanks for picking up all those things. Say, what were those two young hoodlums doing in there? Hoodlums? Why, Bill, those two lads are two of the finest we have here. Are you kidding? Why a year ago I'd a bet my bottom dollar that both of them were on their way to the state reformatory. So they're two of the nicest boys you have here, huh? That's right. Why don't you come by some day and let me show you around this place? Yeah, yeah maybe I will. - Good night, Mike. - Good night, Bill. Okay, kids! All open! Yea! Ah, hello, Bill. What brings you around so early morning? Well, I just got off duty, Mike, I was on my way home, I thought I'd stop in for half an hour and look around. Glad to have you. Come on, I'll show you around. Good. - Morning, Mr. Mike! - Hi, fellas. Say, Mike, that's those two boys again, what are they up to? You'll see. Now, our big game is Saturday as you all know. This is the last chance we have to practice. Now, let's all get out there and give a good practice and really bear down. Aw, go on. I can't imagine that Fred in charge of all those kids out there. He certainly has changed, all right. Well, Bill, that's what this foundation does for boys and girls. And that other kid, Jerry, where is he? Ah, come on, I'll show you. Carrie, come here! For the tenth time, please get it right. 1,199 kids have passed the lifesaving test, have received their certificate, and you'll make an even 1,200. Now let's try it again. Okay, remember you're trying to save me from drowning, not choke me to death, now, let's go. All right. You see? Jerry is our swimming instructor, and doing a marvelous job. As he said, 1,200 kids have passed the swimmer's lifesaving test, and have cards to prove it. Yes, I see it, Mike. I see it with my own eyes, but I still can't believe it. Fred and Jerry certainly had me fooled. Wait until the boys down at the station house hear about this. Bill, the foundation keeps the boys and girls busy. They don't have time for mischief. - Should we go? - Yeah. Nice pick up. Johnson! Yea! Great! Come on, come on, here's the ball. Mike! DeMarco! Good catch! Mr. Abbott. Mr. Costello. Meet a friend of mine, Officer Powell. Bill, meet Abbott and Costello. Hello, boys. Glad to know you, Officer. - Very glad to meet you. - Good to know you. Say, do you boys come down here often? Every chance we get. Sure, hanging out with the kids keeps us young. And this place is open to all kids, huh? No religious or racial distinction? Tommy! Let me have the lineup. Here you go. Go through the lineup. Tony Gonzalez, first base. Willie Johnson, left field. Mike McNulty, shortstop. Irving Rosenberg, center field. Charlie Luong, right field. Pete Pelligrini, second base. Joe Wyroczyk, third base. Olaf Swenson, catcher. Carl Ludwig, pitcher. - Does that answer your question? - It sure does. You know, this is marvelous. I still can't believe it. Mr. Costello, we're getting sort of anxious to start the game. We haven't got any umpire. Would you umpire for us? Tommy, I'd like to, but Mr. Mike, Abbott and I, we have to talk about the party tonight. Hey, wait a minute. How about the officer umpire? How about it, Officer? Well, I'd sure like to, but I don't know whether the kids would like to have me. What do you say, Tommy? Well, sure, but if an officer umpires, we can't steal any bases. - I'm in! - Okay. Okay, boys! Play ball! Okay, fellas, come on, let's play ball here! Batter up! Strike one! Strike two! What's the matter, Tommy? Come on, play ball, play ball. What is it, Tommy? My ankle. Well, can you stand on it? Ow! We better have somebody look at this. We'll take him over to the clinic and let the nurse look at him. Clinic? The foundation's clinic. It's right over there. Oh, well, I'll take him over. You get my hat. Come on, Tommy. We'll get you right over there. Thanks, son. You'll be all right, Tommy. - Does it hurt? - Nah. No more baseball for a few days, though. Aw, gee! I've got to play the big game Saturday. Not this Saturday, but if you take medicine regularly, you'll be able to play the following Saturday. Aw, who ever heard of taking medicine for an old bruise? The medicine I'm prescribing for you is a great, big chocolate soda every day. Think you better run right over to the snack bar now. Hey, I could use some of that medicine myself. Let's go, Tommy! - Bye-bye, Tommy. - Okay. Bye. This is it! Ah, it's pretty nice. - I'll treat you, Officer Powell. - No, Tommy, this one's on me. Two chocolate sodas. Officer Powell, is it true what Mr. Abbott and Mr. Costello told us about you policemen? Well, what's that, Tommy? Whenever we get in any fights, or in any trouble or anything, we should always come to you first? Why, sure, it's true, Tommy. That's what we policemen are here for. If you kids get in any trouble and you don't come to us, how are we ever going to get to be friends? That's what they say. Oh, there you are, Bill. Didn't know where you'd gone. What happened to you, Tommy? I heard you were in the clinic. Oh, I got hit by a pitched ball. The nurse said it was just a bruise. Imagine that, Mike, they got a clinic here with nurses and everything. There are a lot of things here you haven't seen yet. You stay here, Tommy. I'm going to show Officer Powell through the foundation. - Okay. - Come on, Bill. How much for the sodas? Officer Powell, you don't pay anything here. Everything is free. - Oh! See you later, Tommy. - Bye. You know, Bill, this foundation is a big place. We have three acres of ground, and this building covers over 27,000 feet. That's pretty big. - What's in here? - Let's go ahead and see. Sure. This is a hobby shop, where boys and girls are taught to make things that are useful. Come over here. What are you making, Benny? Oh, Friday's Mom's birthday, Mr. Mike, and I'm making her a wall shelf. Oh, that's wonderful, Benny. I know your mother is going to be very proud of that. Who made this? I did. That's pretty good. This room is full of boys from morning till night, making things for themselves and presents for others. Certainly fully equipped, got all the latest type tools, too. That's right. Shall we go? Yeah. Bye, Benny. - It's a great place, all right. - Oh, yes, it is. What about this room here? Well, this room we have our library. Wow, look at all those books. More than 10,000 for the boys and girls who like to read. No wonder I never see any kids on my beat anymore. If I was a kid, I'd be in there every night myself. I bet. Now, in this room, we have all of our athletic equipment, footballs, basketballs, badminton and all kind of games, Baseball bats and gloves and tennis gear. We're starting an archery game pretty soon. And we're even thinking about freezing over the pool to make up a hockey team. That's terrific, but say, this is all for the big kids, what about the little fellas, five and six years old? Well, we've taken care of them too. Outside we have one part of the grounds that's devoted to the little boys and girls. They have a lot of swings and seesaws and sand piles, and even an old wading pool. You haven't forgotten anything, have you? No, I don't think we have. Let's see if something is going on in here. - Uncle Lou? - Yeah. Jackie has rehearsed a number all for you. Would you like to hear it? I would. Go ahead, Jackie, what's the name of the number? "I Don't Want Him." You want to sing me a song? It's for you. Go ahead and sing me a song. ♪ I don't want him ♪ ♪ You can have him ♪ ♪ He's too fat for me ♪ ♪ He's too fat, he's too fat ♪ ♪ He's too fat for me ♪ ♪ I get dizzy ♪ ♪ I get numble ♪ ♪ When I'm dancing with my jum jum jumble ♪ ♪ I don't want him ♪ ♪ You can have him ♪ ♪ He's too fat for me ♪ ♪ He's too fat, he's too fat ♪ ♪ He's too fat for me ♪ - How do you like that? - It's all right. We got a surprise for you too, Uncle Bud. - For me? - You betcha. Jackie, what does Uncle Lou say to Uncle Bud every Saturday morning on the kiddie show? What does Uncle Lou say? Hey, Abbott! Hey, say no more. Well, Bill, I want you to meet somebody over here. Officer Powell, this is Miss Wallace, one of our staff here. - How are you, Miss Wallace? - How do you do? I'm just showing Officer Powell around the foundation. Yes, and I just can't believe that there's a place like this and all free. What's this over here? That's the schedule of the coming events for next week. You see we have a dramatic class here too. I have over 300 children in my dramatic class, and they're all really fine performers. You'll have to come over one of these evenings and see one of our plays. Yes, I'll have to. I'll bring the wife and kids too. We teach many educational things here. As a matter of fact, we have 55 boys and girls studying the piano. And don't forget our ballroom dancing classes, Mr. Mike. We have over 600 children learning all the new steps for the Conga, La Bamba, waltzes. I'll have to take a couple of lessons. You should see some of these youngsters swing it. - I'll bet. - That's right. And in a couple of hours we're showing a feature movie. Couple of hours? Well, look at the time. I came in here this morning to spend a half an hour, and I've been here nearly all day. Well, you were so interested, I didn't think to tell you. I didn't mind it, though. It's one of the most enjoyable and pleasant days I've spent in a long time. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Thanks. I have to run along now. Good-bye. Good-bye, Miss Wallace. You know, this is really a great thing. Who's that little boy? That little man is responsible for this entire foundation. He was Lou Costello Jr. His father didn't get to know him very well, because he lost him on his first birthday. Folks, this is the sort of thing that chases juvenile delinquency right out of a neighborhood. We police officers believe that there is no such thing as a bad boy, if he's given a chance to be a good boy. If boys and girls have some place where they can meet their friends, and indulge in good, clean, healthy sports, without prejudice or intolerance, then, believe me, the battle against juvenile delinquency is won. Don't put the burden on the police. These kids here today treated me as a big brother. Not as a boogie man. We police want the kids to be our friends. And we want to be their friends. We are all fathers too. We have children of our own, and we don't want to see another man's child caught in the toils of the law. You mothers and fathers can prevent that by going to your city councils, asking for an institution like this foundation. Every community wants every boy and girl to grow into decent, honest, respectable citizens, and this is the way to do it. I... I'm sorry, folks, I didn't aim to make a speech, but... well, I guess just got carried away by what I saw here today. That was swell, Bill. I know your message won't go unheeded. I gotta be getting back to the station, Mike. I want to thank you for letting me be your guest here today. Fine, Bill, I'll see you to the door. All right. Oh, Officer Powell, um... Yes, Benny. - I... - Go ahead, Benny, ask him. All right, just give me a little time. Officer Powell, what I wanted to ask you... Aw, quit stalling, ask him! Okay, okay! Officer Powell, what I wanted to ask you is... Have you got any kids? Why, sure, Benny. I got a little boy just about your size. And I got a little girl just about your size. Gee! That's swell. Go ahead, Benny, give it to him. I will. Officer Powell, I've got something here I'd like your little boy to have. Would you give it to him for me? I made this myself. Well, thanks, Benny, that's wonderful. And I want to thank you for my little boy too. I know he'll be very proud of it. Mr. Policeman, here's a doll for your little girl too. Well, thank you, sweetheart. Mike, I want to thank you again for one of the finest experiences I've ever had. - Fine, Bill. - Good luck to you. Officer Powell, Officer Powell, you didn't get your soda, so I brought you an ice cream cone. Well, thank you, Tommy. You're welcome. Good-bye. Good-bye, Officer Powell. You hit a homer next Saturday, you hear?
