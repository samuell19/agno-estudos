It is said that there was a time, when human could see colours. Every colour. It was after the catastrophes, when the whole world sank into despair, that eyes turned grey. While what remains of humanity seeks for survival, the 'Eyeless', some strange and feared creatures, that inhabit the desolate corners of a ruined world, multiply. There are rumors, barely whispered, of the existence of a distant island, crowned by a lighthouse. And of a child... You can't be found. Are you thirsty? BLUE And the child? The child doesn't exist. He's dead. They killed him. We'll be alright. You're all dirty. We're running out of gas. Come here, I'll drive. Jota... Yes, I saw them. Accelerate. Stop the car! Stop! Get out of the car. Stay there. Don't make me take it away from you. You should have a really good reason to aim a gun at a man of the law. This doesn't work. Ouch! Ouch! Don't worry, they can't smell us from up here. How is she? She's fine for now, but it's getting infected. What are you doing here? Come with me. And the briefcase? The child doesn't exist. Doctor... She exists. Do you know how long it's been since I last saw one of these? What are they called? Don't take it. Focus. Where did you get it from? Do you want it? How did you know it was a red one? Color is here, in our head. I can feel it. And if I get it wrong, it can't be that bad, going blind, ripping out your eyes. I can't see... Where's the light? Jota! Jota! You've never seen a color. It's beautiful to see a color. You've never seen one. It's not that bad. What? To be like you? Taking this shit. Does it hurt? Kind of. Well, it's better if it hurts, means you're alive. This will disinfect it, and relieve the pain at the same time. It's all natural. What's that? That's a peacock. It's a kind of bird. They say that when it unfolds its feathers, it's because it's about to rain. I dreamed of one just like that one. Just when I was about to quit smoking. It's been a long time since I last did this. As a child I always had the same dream. I could see the color of the water. The moment I got to see it, I woke up. I wanted to go back to sleep, but I couldn't. It's been years since I last had a dream. I have a nightmare. Always the same one. I'm in my room and I hear a noise coming from the window, I come closer, and there they are. Not one or two, thousands, everywhere, I can't even count them. What's your plan? With Ana and Jota. Going East. Is that still your plan? It's what I have to do. What about Ana? What about her? Why do you sentence her to go with you? What do you suggest me to do? That I abandon her on some road? You weren't there. I had no choice. Just like now. What about Jota? What about him? The pills, Zeta. We need to go back. Olives. What are they? Bullets. Be careful. Don't squeeze them. They explode. But... but you just threw one at me. It's food. At first they taste a little bitter. But then, hmmm, delicious. They are horrible! Be careful! And that notebook? It's a gift from Emma. I don't steal. May I see? The island... What? The island. Do you know the story? When I was a boy, they told me a story about an island... According to what they say generation after generation, the people that lived there, could see the colors. Every color. Yes, like before it... Yes, like before it happened... There was talk of a lighthouse... A lighthouse? They were tall towers that were used to guide lost sailors. They followed the light, and arrived at destination. Many tried to get there. But no one ever did... How did you know? Because it's always like that. You're right. I got used to being alone after you left. I'm sorry. What are you apologizing for? For leaving, I guess. You had to, didn't you? Sometimes you don't choose situations. It's the other way around. Then don't be sorry. You did what you had to do. I think we can... Look, it doesn't matter what you think, what matters is what happens. Not what will happen or what you think. Don't you always say that? I think we can be together aga-- Love doesn't exist. Since a long time ago. What? Nothing. Happens every time there's too much ash. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I hate it when things break. And from what I see, in this house everything is broken. I'm not bothering right? No. Is there someone else in the house? No, I'm alone. Green. Red. Not everyone can see both colors. Are you okay? You're shaking, Emma. It would be a pity if you couldn't enjoy all of this anymore. If your eyes become... blind. If you can't see this forest anymore... If you can no longer wake up in the morning to see a sunrise. You're going to scream when the night falls. And at times, that strange feeling, that you still have eyes, that you will be able to open them, to blink, and to see again. You won't make me take you with him, will you? Where is the child? Are you guys hungry? Lucia! And the manners? Where are your manners? Look me in the eyes when I'm talking to you, please. Huh? Why don't you look me in the eyes? What's wrong? Don't you like my eyes? I think she doesn't like you. Do you know what's happening? She just can't resist me. That's what's happening. Is that it? If you look at me you can not resist me. Look at me, my love. Lucia! Lucia, right? This is dirty. You shouldn't have drawn attention. Calm down. We're leaving. I need some water. Can you give me some water? My friend hit me, he doesn't like losing. He is a terrible loser. You have to be obedient, do you know what happens to girls who aren't obedient? I would be a little more careful. The boys want no trouble, right? He hates violence. He prefers games. Just a detail... I don't like losing. We are not interested. We respect rules here. I play. One is poison. The other just a sip of life. Each player has to drink from one of the two bottles. The poison effect takes exactly 30 seconds. Water refreshes. It's all a matter of luck. We just have to wait. You forgot the blue. I want two rooms, gasoline, and for everyone to leave. Everybody out! Why did you do that? I'm sorry. Do you understand the situation you put yourself on? If only one of them finds out... I get it Zeta, I'm not stupid. Don't you ever do something like that again. What if I didn't play? What would've happened if I hadn't play? He knew, Zeta... Mr. Blue... The last test. What are we going to do without Mr. Blue? We need time. We can't be in this place for too long. I protect you. Jota protects you. I also protect you. Legends. Calm down. What do you want? If you want to drive, you will need gas. I know where to find, I know a place. In exchange for what? Escaping. Where's Zeta? I don't know. Where is he? He is... On the East. She dreams. She dreams. Who dreams? The child. We'll be right back. I don't know you but for some reason you got into my party. You come to my office, you offer me pills. Something is not right. What's your name? Zeta. Zeta, like the letter. Zeta... Tell me, Zeta. What's worse... ...than attending a party you weren't invited to? When you can't get out of it. What's somebody filled with pills, doing at my party? I want gas. Where did you get them from? What he's asking is where does what we are going to sell to our people come from? Do you understand? From someone that's dead. What a tragedy. He is taking too long, he is taking too long. Pure. You've never tried colors. Give me. Give me the pills. Give him gas, and make him leave. We're leaving. Bring me the child. Fuck! Zeta... Give me the gun. Don't panic, they are harmless. The map ends towards the East. We could go South... But? We have never gone that far. Do you hear that? That is a violin. Shhh! You almost interrupt copulation. Come in, come in. Sorry for the mess. Aren't they lovely? It's been decades since I last saw other people. I mean, other people who aren't blind. But I'm not alone. I've got them! And Parmenides. Parmenides? Yes, yes. Parmenides. It is the last of its kind. But, who are you? What brings you here? We run out of gas. I'm Ana. Jota. Zeta. Nice to meet you! Do you want a drink? What do you have? Beer! Craft beer from the house. Oh, and food, mushrooms of the last harvest. Oh, and you can spend the night if you wish... I got room. No, no drinks for you, you know that already. Alcohol interferes in the study. When I discovered how to synthesize XQ28, which is the gene that causes everything, it was already too late. There was, in fact, a way to go back. A treatment based on what we know today as Iris. For them it was easier to let it all fall apart, to disintegrate society. To let the panic and chaos spread. And we already know what is achieved after that. Unfortunately, they stole my formula. Or did I sell it to them? I do not remember very well. And they turned it into a perdition, selling it as a panacea. And in some way, even if I didn't want it, I became responsible. What do you see? Where? Today we have to live with the results of that act: the blind. Here. Dots. Black and white dots. Don't you see the number? And what's the plan? For years, man has stopped having plans. Which number? The 74. What did you say? I asked something to Jota. Yes, yes, that. What did you ask him? I asked him if he could see the number. Let's see. What can you see there? Number twelve... What about this one? A red forty-two. And in this one? A yellow six... Enough. Ishihara, the cards of Ishihara, only who can differentiate all the colors, can see the numbers in those sheets. That would be the irrefutable proof dear Marcelo. No, no, no. Science can not restore color to man. No... Science can not restore color to man. No.. It can't... No, no, no, no. You have to leave! You have to leave right now, this is more dangerous than you think. It was a mistake, it's my fault. My fault! Take her. Take her! Science can not retrieve the colors to mankind. But she can. Zeta. Get to the car! I'm fine. Why would I lie to you? I'm going to get you out of here, brother. I'm going to get you out. Come with me. Zeta. I'm dying. I thought it would be worse. Take care of yourself. Take care of her. I'm going to stay here, okay? What are you doing? Don't leave me alone. Ana. Everyone is dead because of me. No one is dead because of you. You are going to do it very well. I love you. Go. Go. Go. Zeta! It was just one more bullet. You had already done almost everything. I never understood why you saved her. Zeta. Zeta! We would've made it far. Where is the child? I don't know what is worse... Dying... Not everyone can see both colors. No! No! Or becoming one of them. What you're going to see will be the last thing you'll see of the world. Remember it the best you can. The child is on foot. She is not going to make it far. I'm sorry. Run. Run. There was talk of a lighthouse. They followed the light, and arrived at destination. Keep walking. Whatever happens, don't go back.
