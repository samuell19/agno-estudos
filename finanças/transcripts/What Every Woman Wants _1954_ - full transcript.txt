(dramatic orchestral music) (alarm whistles) (lively orchestral music) - Oh, Mark. I'd like you and the lads to work over this evening. - Oh? - Just till job's finished. It's a rush order from America, you know what that means. - Yeah, I know what it means all right. More profit for the boss. - You'll get your overtime rates, same as usual. - No, thanks. - (chuckles) I wouldn't say no, Mark. I could do with the money. - Well, I'm not stopping you. You can work 24 hours a day, if you're fool enough. - Don't be so daft, Mark. You know very well they can't go on without you. - That's their bad luck. I've got something better to do tonight. - One of your meetings, I suppose? - Yes. - Going to dream up more rubbish to paint on people's walls? - Now, you listen to me. Through no fault of yours, you're my father-in-law. Through no fault of mine, I have to live in your house. All right then, that gives you certain rights over me, but it doesn't give you the right to criticize my politics, or tell me what to do on my own time. And the sooner you realize that, the better we'll get on. (moody orchestral music) - All right, lads. Go on home. - Well, that's another day done with, I'll be at the dogs tonight, if I can get me money out me old woman. - The old woman will be at me tonight, if I don't get any money out of the dogs. (bright orchestral music) - There you are, dear. "Care to charge it to my account, young woman?" - Oh, Mrs. Ramsbottom again. - Yes. That's the fourth bottle of perfume she's had this month, but it doesn't make any difference. She still comes through it. - See you at the dance tonight? - Oh, yes, that new chap from the furnishing department's taking me. - Which one's that? - I don't know his name yet, but, he's the one in lino with spots. You're coming, aren't you, Jane? - Yes, yes, Mark's taking me. I bought a new dress for it, too. - Oh, lucky you, my boyfriend will have to be content with the old pink taffeta. Goodnight! - Goodnight. - See you later, Jane. - All right. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - That you, Sarah? - No, it's me! - Oh, I'm just making a pot of tea. Will you have a cup with me? - Love one, Granddad. Mark not back yet? - No, love, you're first home. - Steady on the tea, now. - Huh? - Since we adopted you, I haven't had a decent cup of tea. - These shops. You'd think they were doing you a favor serving you. I swear I won't go to them again. - That's right, love, you starve. (chuckles) That'll learn 'em. - Granddad, just look at your braces. - Braces? Where? What? - Dangling again! (titters) You're not fit to live in a respectable house. (grandfather groans) - Now look what you've done. You'll have me britches off me backside. - There's your baccy and you owe me six and tuppence. - Six and tuppence? - Aye. - What am I smoking, gold dust? - And there's a nice bit of tripe for your supper. But if you've mended your teeth. - Mom, look. - Oh, Jane, dear, it's beautiful. - Mm-hm. - I'll pick you up in about 20 minutes. - Okay. Jane? - Here, Mark. - Ah, there you are. Supper ready? - It won't be long. - Good. Oh, what's that? - Why, it's my new dress, of course. - It's very nice, what's it for? - The dance tonight, silly. - Oh, the dance, I forgot. Jane, I've got a meeting on tonight. - Mark, you're joking, it's a staff dance. - You'll have to go on your own. - But, Mark, you-- - I can't help it, Jane. It's very important. - And I'm not? - Oh, I said I was sorry. Anyway, you know I'm not so hot at dancing. Look, you go on your own. There'll be a lot of fellas there to dance with you. Especially if I'm not around. - But I don't want to dance with anyone else. Oh, Mark, you promised-- - Jane, please don't start a row. I've got enough on my mind. - I am sick to death of your meetings, and your politics. - Oh, you'll never understand. - Now then, love, no sense in upsetting yourself. - Well, I'm fed up with it, Granddad. He's never in the house five minutes nowadays. All he needs a home for is to sleep. - You know, what you want, is a baby. - Isn't that what every woman wants? But not in my mother's front parlor, thanks. - (chuckles) Oh, nonsense. Why, your mother would love it. - I know she would, I'd never know if it was mine or hers. - (laughs) You go up a few places on the council's list. - (chuckles) I need quads to get in the first thousand. - Look, Jane, if you're not gonna get my supper, just say so, will you? - Mark? Couldn't you possibly get away from the meeting early? I wouldn't mind if we go to the dance late. - Look, can't you understand, there are some things more important than dancing? - Got a date, haven't you? - Yes, with some intelligent men. - I see there was a big explosion in the munition works yesterday. (chuckles) That'll be a bit of good news for 'em, won't it? - Look, why don't you stop picking on me? It wasn't my fault I wasn't in the army. - Who said anything about being in the army? - You've always had it in for me, haven't you? Just because I was in the reserves occupation during the war and just because you've got a chest full of medals, you act like a tin god, and that goes for that ruddy cousin you're always yapping about as well. - Jim Barnes, you mean? - Ah, that's right. Captain Jim Barnes. Well, he got enough medals in the last lot, didn't he? And what did our grateful country do for him? Bunged him out to Korea to fight somebody else's war for them. - He volunteered! - Yeah, more fool him. - Don't talk to him when he's eating, he might choke. - And a good thing, too. Stop him talking tripe. - For heaven's sake, get him out of here, before I throttle him, will you? - What have you been up to, teasing Mark again? - Ah, it's rust on him. No sense of humor. - Maybe so, but he's got a right to his opinions, you know. - That's all right, but there's no reason why he should be walking around house looking as though he got a mouth full of castor oil. - He's got as much right here as you have, and don't you forget it. - Oh, don't worry. I'll be off soon enough. With my feet first and a hearse to carry me. - Trust you not to walk if you have a chance of a ride. - Supper ready, Mom? - Will be as soon as your dad gets in. - Well, hurry it up, will ya? I've got to meet Mary. (horn honks) - Did I hear you bring your bike indoors? - I had to, it looks like rain! - Well, you can just take it right out again, and quick. You know what your father will say. - All right, all right, I'll move it before he gets here. - You're too late, he is here. - Is that you, Dad? - Oh, is that me. Who did you think it was, Reg Harris? - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Dad. - I told you before to keep that thing out of here. - Oh, look, you've dented my back spokes! - Aye, and I'll dent your backside, if I find it in here again. Him and his blinkin' bike. I told him about leavin' it in the... And now that thing. What're we running in this house, an obstacle race? - Oh, sounds like you had a bad day at the works. - It were all right until I had words with young Mark. - Hm? - They wanted him to work overtime, but he refused. - Oh, now you can't blame him for that, Bill. He's going to take our Jane to a staff dance. - Aye, that's what you think. He's told her she can go by herself. He's got a meeting to blow something up. - Granddad, you don't mean it? - I just wanted to apologize for losing my temper at the works today, but I really couldn't work overtime tonight. - Aye, I gathered that. - I'm sorry, but it's important. - Mark, don't disappoint her, lad. If you only knew how excited she's been over this dance. Couldn't you, couldn't you manage it just this once? - I've been all through this with her already. It's not for myself, you know. There are others that I'd be letting down. - And what about our Jane, aren't you letting her down? - You don't think I like leaving her at nights, do you? I've asked her time and time again to come to meetings with me, or perhaps she hasn't told you that. - She's not interested in your sort of politics. - Oh, well I'm not interested in her sort of dancing. So, that's that. - Oh, there you are. - Yes. - Mark? You'll need this, it looks like rain. - Jane, I... - Well, are you coming? - Yes, I'm coming. - If I were her, I'd run away and leave him. That's what I'd do. - If you was her, he'd be glad to get rid of you. - Why can't you tell him to pack up and get out? If he can't mend his ways. - Listen, Dad, why don't you control your tongue? Haven't you learned anything in 74 years? - Aye, I've learned that a man's home's his castle. Till vermin gets in. - Never mind the vermin. You get on with your tripe. (knocks) Jane, would you like a cup of tea, love? - No, thanks, Mom. - Herbert! Come and get your supper! Herbert! - I'll have to be quick, Mom. - What's that supposed to be, fancy dress? - It's my new cycling outfit. For our holidays, me and Mary and going to the lakes. - Tonight? - Course not. But we thought we'd go for a spin this evening. Just the try them out. - Oh, aye? - Well, for heaven's sake, wait till it gets dark. (knocks) (dog barks) - Oh, Herbert. - You like the outfit, Mary? - Oh, oh, you look lovely. - I thought we'd try it out tonight. - I'll go and get my bike. - Right. I thought we'd have a run out to the park. - Oh, no, Herbert. Let's go somewhere where everyone can see you. - Oh, all right. You all set? - Yes. (thunder claps) (rain splashes) - I hope it's only a little one! - But it'll rock me saddle. - Oh, my perm! - Eh? - What about my perm? - Oh. (sighs) (Mary yelps) Come on. (thunder claps) - Sarah still upset? - Aye, I've sent her in nextdoor, by the time she's had half an hour of Mrs. Edwistle's morning sickness, she'll have forgotten all about her own troubles. - Well, now we'll get a bit of peace. - Aye, cut the crew. - Can't we come in, Dad? - Oh, aye. - Evening, Mr. Brown. - Hello, Mary, love. - Evening, Mr. Brown. - Well, don't stand there like orphans of the storm. Sit down. - Are you going to be in here long, Dad? - No, only just all the evening. - Oh. - Oh. - It's raining out and it's cold. - Oh, so that's what it is? I thought someone had seen you in that lot and chucked you into the river. - Oh, we couldn't go into Mary's place 'cause they're busy. - 10. - 20. - 30 for one. - 31 for two. - Their Agnes is having a baby. - Well, that'll give your mother something to think about, Mary. - And their Agnes. 15 for two, 15 for four. A pair is six and six is a dozen and two for a pair-- (lively jazz music) What the blazes? - Sorry, Granddad. - Why can't you do your courting on the quiet? I never needed no music to help me. - Oh, but look who you married. - It's raining cats and dogs out. - I know, I know, and they can't get into the pictures, and their Agnes is having a baby. - Well, you carry on, Herbert, as though we weren't here. I'd like to see how they go about it these days. - (chuckles) Aye. (Herbert sighs) Here, Jane and Mark are out. Why don't you go in there if you can't manage in here? - Shall we? - Well, of course, I don't want to spoil your game. - And we don't want to spoil yours, love. - Oh, thanks, Dad. - And turn that wireless off. And turn that light in there on. - Oh. - Things are difficult for young 'uns these days. When I were a lad, I did my courting in back of a slaggy. And when it were raining, I knew a nice dry stable I could get in. Them were the days. (doorbell rings) - Now, who the heck can that be? - Just as I'd got a good hand. (chuckles) We must play this one. - Yes? - Hello, Uncle Bill. - Jim! Why, we thought you were, come in, lad, come inside. - Well, how is everyone? - Oh, fine, fine. Let me take your bag. By gum, won't Granddad be glad to see you. - Hurry up and get rid of whoever it is, Bill! - He's never let us hear the last of it, since you got that third pip. - Jim! Jim! - Hello, Granddad. - It's good to see you, lad. Come in, sit down, sit down. I thought maybe you'd-- - Bought it? No fear. - Well, they can't kill tough ones like us, can they? Only it's two years since I heard from you. - Oh, you know I never write letters, Granddad. - Hey, your aunt Sarah's having a gas nextdoor. I'll give her a knock. Oh, better give them a knock too in case. (knocks) Can I come in a minute? They're too busy. (knocks) - What is it? - Come on home, you've got company! - Coming, love! - You're home for good? - I'm on demob leave. - What? You're not coming out? - I stopped one. - No, bad? - No, not really. How's Jane? - Oh, she's fine, lad. - I'll be glad when Mrs. Edwistle's had that baby and done with it. - Hello, Aunt Sarah. - Why, if it isn't little Jimmy! Well! Sit down, love. Well, I never expected to see you again. - Well, after all, you're the only folks I've got. - What about your wife? - I'm afraid I caught it properly there. She's run off with someone better, or with more money. - Oh, what a shame, would you like a nice cup of tea? - No, thanks, Aunt Sarah, I had one at the station. - Then what're you going to do now, Jim? - Well, they fixed me up with a good job, but it doesn't start for a couple of weeks, so I thought I'd come along and see you all. - And you did quite right, lad. And now you're here, you can stop for a bit. - What? - Granddad, how can he stop here? We've got a house full already. - Oh, no, don't worry about me, I'll go to the hotel. - What? Man with a DCM sleeping yon fleepit? Not on your life. He can have my bed. - Well, I dare say we could manage, if you wouldn't mind the sofa in here? - I'd appreciate it, Aunt Sarah, for tonight anyway. - Of course, only, it's a bit difficult like, with Jane and Mark in the front parlor, you understand? - Are they living here? - They, uh, can't get a house yet. - I see. Is she... Are they in there now? - Oh, bless you, no, you know what youngsters are. They're out somewhere enjoying themselves. (peaceful orchestral music) (audience laughs) - And I tell you, it's in your power. You're the people who do the work, you know. Not the unions and not the owners, but you! Without you, the factories would be useless. And it's in your power to shut them up! - I wish we had the power to shut you up! - Yet, despite all that, despite all that, you're the lowest paid, the worst fed and the worst housed. You let yourselves be pushed around like a lot of animals! Not a day passes without one of you getting victimized. Take Matt Kosher, for example. - You take him, we don't want him! - If you don't shut up in the back, you'll be put out. - Oh, aye, and who's gonna put me out? - I will. - You and who else? - Comrades, please listen to me, listen to me! We must not fight amongst ourselves. - Hey, who did that? - I brought you another rug. - Oh, thanks, Aunt Sarah. - I shall have to get you up early in the morning I'm afraid. There's a bit of a rush here then, with there only being one gas cooker, one bathroom and so on. - (chuckles) Don't worry. I shall be up before the rest, I expect. - Well, whatever you do, don't let Granddad get in anywhere before you, or you'll be held up for an hour or two. - Right, I'll watch it. - Ah, you look comfortable enough now. So, I'll say goodnight. - Goodnight, Aunt Sarah. And thanks for everything. - It's a pleasure to have you, Jimmy. I'll switch the light off as I go. Goodnight, love. - Goodnight, love. I thought you were a ghost. - Not yet, lad. I've forgotten me biscuits. - Biscuits in bed? I seem to remember a joke about that. - No joke when you've got my trouble. Wakes me up at four o'clock every morning, regular. And I find if I nibble a couple of these, it sorta soaks up the wind. - Well, goodnight, Granddad. - Goodnight, Captain. Sir. - Just looked in to say goodnight. I didn't wake you up, did I? - No, no, Uncle Bill. - That's good. Well, uh, sleep well. - (chuckles) Yeah, yes, I'm sure I will. - Aye. (dog barks) (bell dings) (groans) - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Dad, but you said I could bring it in here after everyone was in bed. - All right, all right! Only get it out of the flipping passage! Suppose we oughta be thankful you haven't got a car. It's time you were in bed. - Yes, Mr. Brown. Night, Mr. Brown. (Herbert sighs) - Hello, Herbert. - Hello, old Jim. Are you going to sleep here? - Why, did you want to ride around the room? - Eh? Oh, no, I keep it in here usually, 'cause there's not enough room in passage. - Well, don't mind me. - Ta, I won't. Has Mark come back yet? - I don't think so, why? - I wanted to know how they got on at the meeting tonight. There may be a strike, you see. - Would it worry if there is, Herbert? - Oh, but it'll worry me if there isn't. If they come out, me and Mary are going on a bike tour of the lakes. - Oh, I see. (door closes) - Maybe that's him now. (gentle orchestral music) No, it's only Jane. I don't suppose Mark'll be back till later, he never is. Well, that seems all right for the night. - Yes, I'm very comfortable, thank you, Herbert. - I meant the bike. - Oh, sorry. - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight, Herbert. - You like the light off? - Yes. If it's all right with the bike. - Oh. - Hello, Janie. Did I frighten you? - Why have you come back? - I'm that old bad penny that keeps turning up, remember? - You shouldn't. I just got used to the idea of never seeing you again. - I know. There's a lot I want to explain. - It's a little late for explanations, isn't it? - Are you happy? - As happy as most, why? - They told me you and your husband were out enjoying yourself tonight. - Oh? Yes, yes, that's right, we went to a dance. We're always going dancing, it was great fun. Mark's just seeing some other people home. - Oh, I see. - Well? - Janie, I wanted to come back for you long ago. You must believe that. - I believe it. I know soldiers. They get a leave, they want to have fun, so they look up an old girlfriend. - There's more to it than that. - Yes, the old girlfriend's married, but don't worry, Jim, I'll play the game. We'll have lots of fun, make you feel at home and send you off overseas to have more fun with someone else. - Janie. - I'll be the perfect hostess. Are you comfortable? Got everything you want for the night, enough pillows? - Janie, please. - No, no, no, no, no! Our hero's returned from the war, we must keep him happy. (sighs) And look at your uniform. The least we can do is to hang-- - No, Janie. (dramatic orchestral music) (Jane sobs) Janie. - Oh, darling, I'm so sorry. - How were you to know? I'm much better off, really. I always had a corn on that foot. - All those terrible things I said to you just now. - You had every right to, I deserved it. (train whistles) (melancholic orchestral music) Nice night now. - About time, after all the rain. - It's like that last night in Blackpool. - That was a wonderful leave. - I remember every detail of it. The night we won the spot dance competition. The dash home in the rain from the Pleasure Beach. The old harrodine of a landlady who wanted to see our marriage lines. - Oh, Jim, why didn't you come back? - I don't know, Janie. I was all mixed up, didn't know what I wanted. After that leave, there was Germany, Egypt, then Korea. There's always a place where soldiers are wanted. - You've left something very important out, Jim. You got married. - Wasn't important? - It should be. - When I got back from Korea, I found she'd run off with another fellow. - Oh, Jim. - Oh, it was a mistake anyway. We went to a registrar's office instead of going to-- - Blackpool? - Now, Janie, no, I didn't mean that. Blackpool was different. Do you hate me? - No, no, Jim, I don't hate you. - What's more important, can you forgive me? - I don't know. Does it matter? I must go in now, Mark will be back soon. - Sleep well, Janie. - Same to you, goodnight. And Jim? Whatever you may have heard, I am happily married. (sighs) - Jane? - I think she's upstairs, washing. - Who are you? - Her cousin, Jim Barnes. - Well, well. I've been waiting a long time to see you in the flesh. - Take a good look. - You don't look much like a hero to me. - Well, who could in pajamas? - What're you doing here? - I was trying to get some sleep. - How long are you staying? - Hadn't thought. - This place is already overcrowded, you know. - Is it? Well, why don't you leave? - We would, if we could. - You're not comfortable here? - No, I'm not interested in comfort. - Well, I am. - Oh, I know your type, anything is good enough for the worker, as long as you're all right. - No, you haven't got that quite right. In the army, we say, "nevermind you, Jack, I'm well placed." Or words to that effect. - I wasn't in the army. I didn't fight for freedom and democracy. (chuckles) That's a laugh, freedom and democracy. Five bob a week on the pulls and once a week to the pictures. Nevermind how or when or even why they live. - (chuckles) You have got it bad, haven't you? But why tell me all this? Why don't you tell your bosses, or are you one of them? - Me, do I look like one of them? 5,000 a year for telling people like me to produce more and consume less. No, I've no time for any of them. Union bosses, capitalist bosses or political bosses. - And what about scout masters? - I can see you're just like the rest of the family. Try and discuss anything above the dogs and the pictures, and you've had it. - Well, that's because you're too serious! Make them laugh and they'll give you the shirts off their backs. - I'd rather pay for my own shirt, thanks. - Or better still, there's something somewhere about a man forsaking everything but cleaving unto his wife. - Yeah, have you ever tried cleaving onto a wife, in your mother-in-law's front parlor? - (chuckles) You've got something there. - (chuckles) Anyway, what're you defending? You're no better off. Look, you've been fighting capitalist wars since 1939. What've you got to show for it? - I've got four post-war credits. - Tell me what they're gonna do for people like you, huh? - Oh, no, not tonight, I've come a long way and I'm tired. - Okay, I'll see you in the morning, I expect. - Fine. Goodnight, comrade. - Goodnight. Sucker. - Shall I put the light out for you? - Yes, please. - You're sure you're gonna be all right? - Wonderful, thanks. - There's nothing I can get for you? - No, thanks. - Jane, are you coming to bed? - Goodnight, Jim. - Goodnight, sweetie. - And goodnight to you, sweetie. (train whistles) He's a friendly sort of a bloke, isn't he? - Why shouldn't he be? - Why not? You two were pretty thick at one time, weren't you? - Naturally, we grew up together. - Mm. - What do you mean, "mm?" - Just that I wouldn't get too friendly again if I were you. He might start getting ideas. - Don't tell me you're going to stoop to anything so ordinary as being jealous. - Me? Not in your life. I'm broad-minded, what happened before we were married is a closed book, as far as I'm concerned. - Are you sure you wouldn't like me to open the book for you, just a little bit? - No. - Supposing I told you he was more than just a boyfriend? - Look, if you're trying to make me jealous, you're barking up the wrong tree. - All right, Mark. - But if he does start any funny business, he'll know about it. - (sighs) Don't say anymore. - If he thinks he can come in here in his fancy uniform and have a darn good romp before going back, he's mistaken. - Oh, please, Mark. - I expect he's banking on everybody feeling sorry for him, just because he's fool enough to go off and fight capitalist for them. - Mark, shut up! You don't understand. - No, don't I? - He... He's lost a leg. (dramatic orchestral music) - Poor devil. Poor, stupid devil. (alarm whistles) - Herbert! (knocks) Come along now, bathroom's empty! - All right. (playful orchestral music) Fat lot of use getting up. (Sarah sighs) (knocks) - Come along now, no dawdling! - No dawdling? I'm waiting for you! Oh, crumbs. - Oh, morning, Jim, sleep all right? - Like a top. - Mm, I heard you spinning. - Mm, I'm afraid I'm always a bit restless. - Wonder how things are on the bathroom front. (Herbert sighs) - Are you still hanging about? - Crikey, what chance have I got to do anything else? - You'll be late for work again, as sure as fate. Hurry up, the rush is on. - Well, I'll wait a bit, let the workers go first. - Don't you believe it. You slide in while you've got the chance. - No good? - No, cuing for all parts. Oh, at last. - Herbert! - What? - Come and move your bike, it's in my way! - Oh, not now, Mom! - Very well, if you want me to move it, then. - Oh, all right, don't mess about with it. - Look, darling, about last night, I-- - Not now, I'm in a hurry. - Good morning, comrade, how's the battle? - There's no cue at the moment anyway. Look, about last night, I may have appeared a bit rude, I was a bit tired. - Were you rude? I hadn't noticed. - Well, I just wanted you to know that I, well, I'm glad to see you're here. - Waiting for this? - What do you think I'm waiting for, a bus? - Good morning, Jim. - Good morning, Granddad. - Excuse me. - Here, you, wait your turn. - Here, I haven't finished in there yet! - Isn't it about time you were thinking of getting dressed? - Well, fancy meeting you here. - Yes, fancy, how did you find out? - Spies. - Granddad one of them? - Could be. - Oh, this is a friend of mine, Dolly Winch, Jim Barnes. - Pleased to meet you. - How do you do, Dolly? - Oh, granted, I'm sure. - I wanted to talk to you. - Here? - Well, I thought perhaps you'd have lunch with me. - Well, um-- - You wouldn't mind, would you, Dolly? - Oh, not at all, I'd love to. - Oh. - Oh, come on, Jane, be a sport! - Well, if you're quite sure I won't be in the way? - Oh, not at all, don't be silly, where shall we go? - Somewhere quiet? - I know just the place! Come on. (lively chatter) - You're sure this isn't a little too quiet? - No, come on, quick, before it gets too crowded. Where do you work, Jim? - I don't. That is, I was in the army. - Really? Oh, what a funny thing now. I used to have a boyfriend in the army. Well, not really in the army. - An officer? - No, a deserter. Oh, but he was ever-so nice, really, he was. You'd never think he'd been to an approved school. Lovely manners, he had. But the things he used to tell me about the army. Well, it was quite obvious, of course, that they never really understood him. There was one sergeant he said who used to say the most terrible things to him. He used words he couldn't possibly repeat to a nice girl, and I couldn't, of course, repeat them here. But, of course, I don't wonder he got out of it, because fancy asking a sensitive lad like that to get up at 5:30 in the morning. Of course, you're much different, you're stronger, and much nicer and I can see that-- - What, me? - Oh. Yes! You, handsome. By yourself? - How's my favorite orator? - All right. - That's the boy. - Help yourself. - Thanks. Look, the meeting's in the same place tonight. Ready to face them again? - Tonight? - Sure! - I didn't think I ought to, after last night. - Well, you're not afraid of a few things being thrown at you, are ya? - No, I wasn't thinking of that. - That's when you've got to hit 'em again. If one sees we're afraid of them, we've had it. You'll have to speak again. - Yeah, I suppose so. - That's the boy. - Have another sandwich. - No, thanks, comrade. Might spoil my lunch. - Here we are, back through Grassmere and then we can go up Elvalid. - I know you're so set on going there, but, I don't think we should, we're going to need every penny. - I tell you, we can do the whole thing for 12 pound. - 12 pound is 12 pound, if ever we're going to get married. - I'm not stopping, so you can carry on. - We were just planning out the best route. - By god, this cold weather makes your knees red, lass. - Yes, it's the wind, mainly. - You shouldn't suffer with that at your age. - Now, how far had we got? - It's no good looking, my mind's made up. - I don't see what you're worrying about! Your Agnes will get a council house, now she's had the other baby-- - What, me? Set up house at my mother's place? If that's what you're waiting on, our engagement's off. - Well, I don't see what else we can do, unless... Unless Jane and Mark leave. - Are you out of your mind? I wouldn't come here to live with your mom, not if-- - What's wrong with my mom? - Aye, what is wrong with me, lass? - Oh, Mrs. Brown. Well, well, I didn't mean anything by that. It's just that, well, I want to have children. - You never said anything up till now about having kids. - Well, what did you expect to have, bicycles? Now, come on, get this muck off the table. That'll be your dad and I've got tea to get. - Mom asked if Herbert could come to tea with us this evening. - She's welcome to him. - I'll go and get me bike. - Bike, and it's only four doors down the street. - Have a heart, I've been on my feet all day, haven't I? Come on, Mary. - Goodnight, Mrs. Brown. - Goodnight, love. - Night, Mr. Brown. - Goodnight. - Hello, dear, had a good day? - I'm fed up with those young idiots at the works. - Oh, what have they been up to this time? - Trying to start a strike. And what's more, they look like getting one. - Oh, well, you could do with a rest. We'll manage, somehow. We always have before. - That Mark's at the bottom of it, him and his rotten pals. He stood up on the platform last night, in defiance of union officials, mind you, and had the nerve to tell them that Matt Kosher was victimized. "Victimized," and him, the drunkenest, laziest-- - Bill. - Well, it fair gets my goat. - You men. You're all born with enough brain and muscle to do a useful job of work, yet you all end up as politicians. - I suppose you'd like women to run the country for us? - Well, they couldn't do much worse. - And have the men do your jobs, eh? - Yes, if it wasn't for the fact that you men would make such a mess about having babies. We'd finish up with a pram full of monkeys or something. - When you see Jane, will you tell her I had to go out, please? - I'll tell her, then. - Another meeting of the Brains Trust? - A committee meeting, if that's what you mean. - Look, I know it's no business of mine, I only work at the factory, but when's the lightning strike going to start? - Now, look, I've got no quarrel with you, but I'm fighting for what I believe to be right. - Such as getting Matt Kosher reinstated, I suppose? - No, I'm not fighting for Matt Kosher, but I am fighting against the machine that tossed him out. The machine that allows men to be pushed around, like so many pawns. - "Machine, pawns," talk sense, Mark, or-- - The baker was telling me today, he's had to get a new horse. The other one used to get itself all worked up and excited whenever a motor blew its horn. (rooster crows) - I suppose you're right, I think I'd better go. - If I threw you out, I suppose you'll go around yelling that you've been victimized? - It's a free country. He has a right to his opinions, no matter how silly. - Just a minute, lass. - Hm? - So, I'm just an old motor blowing its horn? (Sarah chuckles) (Granddad screams) What the blazes? - Granddad! - Hey! Eyes down! Look at it, look at that! - An egg! - Aye, an egg! She's done it at last! - What're you gonna do with it? - Why, have it for tea, of course! - What, all of us? - No, that won't do! Get cards out, we'll cook for it! - Aye. (chuckles) Look out! (granddad screams) (rooster crows) - You can still scramble it. - No, thanks. We'll wait for the next one, two years will soon pass. - Mom, I've just saw Mark's mom and dad coming this way. - Never. - Coming here? - I'm off. - No, you don't, Granddad. You'll stay here and suffer with the rest of us. - Mark in yet? - Aye and out again. Another of his precious meetings. - Oh, that's fine. - Perhaps they'll go past us? - Not her. (doorbell rings) See? - Look, if we all keep quiet, maybe they'll think we're out. - Bill. - Well, here goes. - Gracious me, with a dirty tablecloth on. Oh, she'd just love to see that, quick, give me a hand. - Nice time to come calling on folks. - She always was an awkward one. Never see her from one year's end to the next. Then she calls in the middle of tea. - Is your mother in? - Yes, how nice to see you. Come in. - Is your dad in, too? - Yes. Well, look who is here, Mom, Mr. and Mrs. Hadley. - Oh, how lovely to see you both! - Hello, Sam, good to see you. - Aye, same here, Bill. I hope we haven't come at an awkward time? - No, no, you couldn't have come at a better one. - That's right. You're just in time for a cup of tea, Polly Ann. - No, thanks, we've come to stop. - That's good. - Where's our Mark? - Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed him. - I'm sure you're very sorry. - Not very, just sorry. - We haven't seen him for months, we thought we'd better come along to see if he was still alive. - Was he, when you saw him last, Granddad? - As much alive as he's ever likely to get. - Ah, here we are. Now, I know you'll have a cup, Polly Ann. What about you, Sam? - I've always got room for a drop of your tea, Sarah. - Not too strong, goes straight to his stomach. - Look at her, she's always on about me stomach! - Shut up. - It must be nearly six months since we saw you. - Well, we still live at number 46, don't we? And the number's on the door. - And we still live in number 12, and it's no further from here to there than it is from there to here. - And there's buses every 10 minutes, both ways. - And if someone were to hurry, they'd just catch it. (clock chimes) - Have you found a house yet? - A house, what's that? - You are trying, I hope? Or don't you want to leave your mother? - There are 10,000 before me on the list, and seeing that Mark's got no point of ex-service and I've no kids, there always will be. - Well, the remedy for that lies in your own hands, I should've thought. - If you've come for a row, I'm just in the mood. - Now, Jane, that's enough. - No, it's not enough. I've walked holes in my shoes looking for a place. I've answered hundreds of adverts, and the only offer I've had so far was one room with one table and chair and 50 quid to get in. He's your son, why don't you try and do something? - Jane, mind your temper. Have a piece of cake, Sam. - Oh, thanks, I'm fond of a bit of homemade cake. - I hope there's plenty of bicarbonate in it. - There she goes again. (chuckles) She'll be throwing me over her shoulder next. - I know how you feel about Mark, Polly, but, it's not our fault that he hasn't been to see you lately. He's been busy. - I'm not saying it's your fault, Mr. Brown. - No, it's mine, of course. - Well, if the cap fits. - I've told him to go and see you, over and over again, but I might as well talk to a brick wall. If you want to see him, you better write, and ask for an appointment. He might even like to see his wife at the same time. (sighs) I need some fresh air. - Jane. - I'm sorry, Mom. About the only time I see your precious son is when he turns over in bed. So, work that one out. - Well! - When will you learn to keep your big mouth shut? - Do you realize that precious son of yours hasn't taken Jane out for three months or more? And hardly been home of an evening? - Perhaps he's got something better to do! - Aye, he's got a lot to do, right enough. If he were my lad, I'd put him across me knees, big as he is, and give him a walloping. If it weren't for fact I might knock his brains out doing it. - Sam, I've heard quite enough. - Well, you can't say you didn't ask for that, Polly Ann. - Are you coming or have I got to send your bed? - No hard feelings, Bill? - No hard feelings, Sam. - Sam! - You'd better get along, goodnight. - "Goodnight," with her? Some hopes. - Did I tell you about that lass, Ann, in Singapore? - No, and you better not while I'm around. - Go away, woman, and look after your man. - Jim's just come in, I'm going to get him some tea. - Hello. - Hungry, Jim? - Yes, I could eat a horse, Aunt Sarah. - I should, if I were you. (chuckles) It'll taste a lot nicer than what she'll cook for you. - Oh, you. - Hello, Jim, had a nice day? - I've just been walking around and thinking and looking. - Hey, I noticed in the paper there's an old-fashioned dance on at the assembly hall tonight. - Are you going, Janie? - No. - No, she can't go. Mark's got a meeting tonight. (chuckles) Pity. - Couldn't I take her? - Oh, I don't know about that. Might not be proper. - Well, now, steady on. Jane and I have known each for years. Surely. How about it, Janie? - Yes, why not? (jaunty orchestral music) (lively chatter) - Profits which could give you higher wages and decent living conditions. Profits which could build you houses. What does it matter if the unions do refuse to back our claims? They don't do the work, we do! So, let's fight the owners themselves, on their own ground! (upbeat orchestral music) (audience cheers and yells) (tense orchestral music) I'm asking you to back up the committee. We've got to be solid behind this. And then we'll make one last effort to get the management to listen to our claims. (bell rings) (audience yells) (audience cheers) (tense orchestral music) We've given them every chance! We've tried to negotiate, but they refused. We've tried to have friendly talks with them, but they wouldn't! They forced a strike and they'll get it! Are you with me? (strikers murmur) - That settles it, out he goes. - No, you've said often enough, a man's got a right to his opinions. - I don't dent the right to shout his opinions from the old stops, but I've got my rights, too. This is my house, I bought it, and one of my rights is to bar the door against any man I don't want to listen to. Maybe it's the only freedom I've got left, but it's a good 'un, and by by gum, I'm gonna use it. - Bill, have some sense, they've nowhere to go. You can't do it. - I can do it and I'm going to. - What about our Jane? - He can leave her here. - You old devil. If they part, you'll be the first to go, and quick. - I'll be gone soon enough, but she's young. She ought to enjoy herself. - Maybe he's right, Sarah, they should've parted long since. - You too? You don't know what you're saying. You fool. (sobs) - I'm sorry if I upset you, love. Oh, I know how you feel about it, but I can't help it. Me mind's made up, it's him or me. There's not room for both of us in this house. But... We've always made our decisions together in the past and... I would like you to be with me in this one, Sarah, love. - I better get on with the ironing. There's one or two things of our Jane's there. She'll need them to take with her. - He's a very good speaker, that Mr. Humphrey. Well, didn't you think he gave an interesting talk? - How should I know? I was asleep! (peaceful jazz music) - Ready? - Yes. - Well, did you see that, Samuel? - What? - Only our Mark's wife going off with their new lodger, that's all. - Cor, not the one I saw with her at the dogs? - That'll be him, come along. - Where to? - To see Mark! - Oh, no. You can go if you want to, I'm gonna have a drink. - A drink, after just coming out of a Bible meeting? - Well, have you heard what that Mr. Humphrey said about the unquenchable spirit? - Well? - Well, it's given me an unquenchable thirst, and I'm going to slake it. - Would you like another drink? - No, thanks, Jim, we'd better get home. If you don't want to miss the fun. - Fun? - Mark's mother saw us coming in just now. - Oh, I see. Well, I suppose he had to know sometime. Do you think she'll go home and tell him tonight? - Oh, like a streak of lightning. I can see her this very minute. "I am not the one to poke my nose "into other folks' affairs." - But my son's affairs are my affairs and always will be. And nobody can deny a mother's right to that. - What're you gassing about? - You'll soon know. If you'll allow me to wait here till Mark comes back. - You'll have to wait a long while, then. He's down at strike committee meeting, clapping himself on the back. - I can wait, if I'm not keeping you up. - Well, don't stand there like patience on a monument. Sit down and tell us what's up. - She's got something on her mind. If she doesn't get it off soon, she'll burst her britches. - I hear that you've got so much room here, that you've taken in a lodger. - He isn't a lodger. I'm putting up my sister-in-law's lad for a while. But I didn't know it had been put out on BBC. - I suppose you know that Jane's carrying on with him? - Oh, so that's it. Aye, that's what I like about you, Polly Ann. You can smell muck a mile off. - Then you admit there's muck to smell? - Certainly not. - But I saw them myself. Drive up in a taxi, as brazen as you please. You'd never have caught me doing that with a lodger. - You'd never been asked. - I hope you know what you're playing at, Polly Ann. - I know that she's my son's wife and that it is high time that he was told she's got a fancy man. - That's enough. I'll not have anybody talking about my girl like that. - Truth always hurts. - How dare you. - Get out of here. - Is that you, Mark? Mark. - Hello, Mother, you're up late, aren't you? - I've been waiting to see you. - I can't stop now, I'm in a bit of a rush. I only came back to collect some papers. - Good, then while you're getting them, you can get the rest of your things! - What is this? - You heard me. Pack up your bags and get out, and then go and scream to your pals that you've been victimized. - Has Jane been told about this? - Don't you worry about her, she's with her fancy man. - Her what? - Her fancy man, the lodger. - Jim? - Yes Jim, if that's his name. - Well, I'm damned. - What're you going to do about it, Mark? - Jim's all right. - Well, I've never heard the like of that in all my days. Aren't you going to do anything about it? - Yeah, I'm gonna tell Jane to pack her things. We're not welcome here. - (chuckles) Taken you long enough to find that out. (Sam sings drunkenly) - Well, lads, I can see you've given him the glad tidings. (sings drunkenly) - I've told him the truth, and I don't need any booze to help me! - Good, all the more for us. ♪ For tomorrow we'll be sober ♪ (chuckles) ♪ For tonight, we'll merry be ♪ ♪ For tonight, we'll merry be ♪ ♪ For tonight, we'll merry be ♪ ♪ Tomorrow we'll be sober ♪ Come on, let's have some glasses. - Glasses, what for? - I'm asking you to have a drink! Oh, come on, Bill! - I'm no mood for boozin', Sam. - No, no hard feelings, Bill? - No hard feelings, Sam. - (chuckles) Come on, then. - How you can think of drinking in this house of shame, I don't know. - Oh, shut up, you silly old woman. - I'll talk to you when you're sober. Mark wants to carry on as if nothing had happened. - Well, and what has happened? - I can guess. - Oh, for heaven's sake, get her home, Sam, before I do something I shall be sorry for. - I'm not budging. - Come on, get yourself up! - You'll have to carry me out. - It's a pleasure. Come on. (Polly Ann yelps) - What's all this? - She's here. - Put her down, I tell you. You'll have all the neighbors in. - Well, here goes. We might as well give them what they're looking for. Oh, that was a wonderful evening, Jim, darling. - I'm glad you liked it, sweetie. - There, what did I tell you? - I'm warning you for the last time, Polly Ann. - Well, look who's here, what a surprise. Jim, come and see what the cat brought in. - Good evening. - Same to you, have a drink? - Oh, thanks. - There, what did I say? - Like my new dress? Jim does. Oh, it's been wonderful, we've been everywhere. Maloney's, Three Horseshoes and then to The Orchid. - In a taxi? - That's right, in a nice, dark taxi. - Jane, do you know what you're saying? - (chuckles) Of course! - You villain, what did you put in her drink? - Vodka. - Where have you been? - I thought your mother had told you? - I'd rather hear it from you. What's got into you? - Are you asking me to confess everything, in front of your mother? That wouldn't be fair to Jim. - Now, steady on, sweetie. If you want to know whether I'm in love with Jane, the answer is yes, I always have been. But if you want to know whether it's gone any further, the answer is no. - Not yet, anyway. Thank you, Jim, but we've got lots of time ahead of us. - Your father's chucked us out. You're coming with me tonight. - To your mother's? No, thanks. - I'll give you two minutes to pack and bag and change out of that dress. - I am not leaving tonight. - You mean you'd stay here, without me? - It wouldn't be the first time. - Then you are in love with him, aren't you? - You'll come with me if I have to carry you. - Let go, you are hurting me. - Now, look, you are my wife, and you'll do what I tell you! - Leave me alone, go away, I hate you! - Well, you've got what you wanted. You've broken us up, I hope you're satisfied. (door slams) (Jane sighs) - Locked him out of his room, that's what she's done. She'll not get a penny piece, I'll see to that. - Aye, I'll bet you will. - Look after her, Jim. - And you look after yourself, comrade. - You needn't worry about my son. He'll have me to look after him now, thank you. - You make me sick. - You've asked for that, Polly Ann. And may you be forgiven for what you've done this night. - You better save your prayers for her. - No hard feelings, Bill? - No hard feelings, Sam. ♪ For tonight, we'll merry be ♪ ♪ For tonight, we'll merry be ♪ ♪ For tonight, we'll merry merry be ♪ ♪ Tomorrow we'll be sober ♪ (door closes) (knocks) (Jane sobs) (Bill groans) - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Dad! - Eh? Oh, that's all right, son. - Jane, love. It's me. They've all gone. (Jane sobs) Don't fret, love. You're doing fine. (suspenseful orchestral music) - "Hopes of settlement in strike. "After six days of strike, "there was hope last night of a general return to work." Well, read it yourself. And this is no newspaper yarn, it's true. There is a movement to go back. And do you know who's behind it all? Your blinkin' father-in-law. - What? - Your father-in-law, Bill Brown. Look, what's the matter with you, and where have you been the last week? - I haven't been feeling too good. - You'll feel a darn sight worse if this strike fails. They mustn't go back. - We've no right to stop them, if that's what the majority wants. - They don't know what they want. Now, listen. They've called a mass meeting for this afternoon. Well, we're going to be there, and you're going to do the talking, not Bill ruddy Brown. - Frank, I don't know about-- - You turning black leg, too? - All right, all right, I'll be there. - Okay, see you at 3:30 in the committee rooms. (door closes) - Are you all right, son? - Yes, I'm all right. - Well, I don't like to think of you sitting up here, all by yourself. - I'm all right, Mother. - Well, it'll be dinnertime soon, now what would you like? Would you like a tin of salmon or a nice bit of cold ham? - Anything you like, I don't mind, anything you like. - Are you sure you're all right? - For Pete's sake, stop fussing around me, will you, mother? - Well, I'm only trying to please you, dear! - Look, just leave me alone, will you? That's all I ask, just leave me alone. - You've been up here all day! - I'm quite all right. Just leave me alone. (sighs) - Hello, Jane, love. Aren't you going out tonight? - No, Granddad. - Where's Jim? - He went down to the local for a game of darts. - Oh. - Everything is so mixed up. Why did he have to come back? - When a man's in love, he usually does. Jane. Do you love him? - He's had such a rotten time with his marriage going wrong and then his leg. - That doesn't matter. The important thing is, do you love him? - I did. And yes... I do. - I see, has he asked you to go away with him? - No, of course not. - Do you want him to? - I don't know. Really, I don't. - Well, if you don't know, love, if something inside you hasn't told you, why ask me? - (chuckles) Because you're very old and very wise. - (chuckles) I'm old, right enough. You know, 50 years since, I fell in love with a lass. Aye, she were a beauty, too. Made my heart jump every time I looked at her. - Do you mean Granny? - No, no, no, no. Granny and me were wed. We'd planned it all to run away together. Didn't bother about anybody. Only thought about our own little bit of happiness. She had her bags already packed, and then on the night we were to go, your granny told me she was going to have your father. I've often wondered whether that lass would've stuck with me or not, or whether I'd have got tired of her. Fancy women soon go second-hand, you know. - Did Granny ever get to know? - I think she knew all the time, but she never let on. (chuckles) She made a rabbit pie for me that night. (laughs) It's a funny thing, I can remember that rabbit pie with its rich brown crust, as though it were yesterday. But I'm hanged if I can remember that lass's name. Queer, isn't it? - Did it upset you? - Aye, I had indigestion for three weeks. (laughs) But your granny sure nursed that out of me. - And so? - Well, so the moral is that, in the long run, a rabbit pie is more tasty than a fancy woman. - Now what're you up to? Stuffing her head with more of your nonsense, I suppose? - No, I'm giving her a recipe for a rabbit pie. - If you'd kept your mouth closed in the first place, she'd never have started going out with Jim. - Aye and if you'd made men, you'd have put wings on 'em. - Have you heard from Mark yet? - You know quite well I haven't. - Then I think it's high time you went round to his mother's before something serious happens. - And beg to be taken back, I suppose? - It doesn't do a woman any harm to climb down now and then. Especially if she's in the wrong. - Wrong? Before he left me, I was always in the right. Now, I'm wrong. Well, if it's any satisfaction to you, you've helped me to make up my mind. Only, it's not the way you want it. - You must be daft, woman! - Oh, shut up. When I want your advice, I'll ask for it. - I won't shut up, you don't even know your own daughter! You can lead her by the hair of her pretty head, but you'll never drive her! - Things may not be exactly as we'd like them to be, I'll be the first to say that, but we're no worse off than the rest of the country. And we're a darn sight better off than most other countries in the world today. - Hear, hear! - But the quickest way to drag this country down to the level of the others is to keep on downing tools. Mind you, don't get me wrong. I'll always abide by the wish of the majority, but I don't believe that the majority of you do want this strike! - Let's go back! - He's got 'em willing, blast him. - What's the use, you can't argue against that. - All I want is your authority. - We're not finished yet. - There's practically the whole plant here, what can you do? - Where's our common sense, lads? - I'll show ya. - No, Frank, not that way! - What about it? (workers murmur) - Don't listen to Bill Brown, what does he know about it? - Go on, get out of this, go on home! - If the bosses want us back at work, they must take Matt Kosher back, too! - Where is Matt Kosher? - He's at the Starling Yachter. (workers laugh) - Matt Kosher is a victim of class distinction! - Sam, hello! Well, I never expected to see you. - It's Polly Ann, Sarah. She wants to see you, if it's all right. - It's about time she came to her senses. All right, tell her I'll be here when she wants me. - Well, Polly's here now. - I just had to come, Sarah. I'd have gone out of my mind, if I hadn't. - Come in, love. It's about time you and me buried the hatchet. - Well, well, well, what's this, a peace conference? - He does come out with them, doesn't he, Sarah? - Oh, he's so sharp, he'll cut himself one of these days. Sit down, Polly. Oh, you look proper poorly. - This business has taken 20 years off my life. - You don't look any younger to me. - Shut up. I know the very thing for you, love, a nice drop of port. - Believe me or believe me not, I've not had a wink of sleep this week past. Nobody knows what I've been through. Well, it's such a shock. I've never seen such a change in a lad in all my life. - Aww, well, just you drink this up. - I've had a shock too, Sarah. - Have you? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Sam. I'll get you a good dose of bicarb. - Sarah, what do you think? The strike's over, we go back in the morning. - Oh, what have you been doing with yourself, man? - Stopping the strike. - Just look at the mess you're in. Bill, fancy fighting at your age. - Oh, stop fussing, me love, there's nothing wrong. I'll get cleaned up in a minute. What are they doing here? - Drinking all our port. (knocks) - Jane, I-- - Mark? What's happened? - Oh, it's nothing. I want to talk to you, Jane, can I come in? - I suppose so. The rest of your family's here, so why not? Wonderful, isn't it? Our separation has brought the two families together. "In a united front with a common purpose." One of your favorite bits, Mark. - Look, Jane, I know I've made mistakes, plenty of them, but since we've been apart, I've realized one thing that's important to me and that's you. - It's too late, Mark. - No, listen to me, Jane. Please, I wanna get out of this town. There are a lot of places up north where I can get a job. Places where we can be on our own. Will you come with me, please? - It's too late, I've made up my mind. I'll give you evidence for a divorce. - I'll never divorce you, Jane, never. - But you must, Mark. - I love you, Jane, and if we clear out of here, it'll be all right, I promise you. - I couldn't go through all this again, I just couldn't. - Jane, I... - I shouldn't go after her, Mark. - Leave her to cool off for a bit. - Aye, she'll come round in a minute. - Did you have to come poking your nose in again? - Don't talk to me like that. - Oh, she was only trying to help, lad. - Now, listen to me, all of you. The best way you can help is to leave us alone. If she wants to burn the bacon or give me custard for scrambled eggs, I have to eat it, you know, not you. So, leave us alone, will you? If I want to black her eye, that's my business. Let's fight like cat and dog, if that's the only way we can live together. Let's make a mess of our lives, if we want to, but for heaven's sake, leave us alone. And if you don't, we shall end up by hating you. - Don't try and put all the blame on us, lad. - Oh, I don't. Look, I know I've slipped up badly. But still, what happens between a man and his wife is private and as soon as it stops being that way, we might just as well be cattle living in a field. - We are you going, son? - I'm gonna get drunk. - Good, I'll come with you. - Well! Did you ever see the like of that? They'll be the death of me, those two between-- - I hope so, I knew you'd muck it up between you. - Perhaps you'd like to have a go, if you think you're so clever. - Perhaps I will, and see you get rid of yon load of rubbish, before I get back. - Oh, that does it, you're too good for me. - Signs of a misspent youth, I'm afraid. Half, please. - Half, right. - Have one with me anyway. - No, thanks, mate. I'd better get off home to the old woman. With a bit of luck, I'll have me supper thrown at me, while it's still warm. Come on, George. - Goodnight, Jim! - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Two pints, please. - Hello, Mrs. Higgenbottom, how are ya? - All right, thanks. - You too, Granddad? - Aye, couldn't stay in the house, too many darned women. - Well, have a drink? - Thanks, Jim. - Pint of beer, please. - Long time since I was in a pub. (chuckles) Smells good. Used to be a dead hand with these, too. - Like to try your luck? - Aye, I'll have a go. You know, things have come to a bit of a head tonight, Jim. - Oh, I'm sorry, what do you want me to do about it? - Well, I was just wondering, if you might like to go away. - Go away, why? - Give Jane a chance to get her mind clear. - If you think my going away would many difference toward my feeling for Jane, you're wrong. - I'm thinking more of her feelings. She's not the sort of lass that hangs about around the barrack gates, you know. - I never thought she was. - Well, I just mentioned it, in case you might think she loves you, over what's happened during the war. - Oh, and what happened during the war? - What happens to most young couples in all wars, as far as I've heard of. They put passions into the lads and sympathies into the lassies and before you know where you are, they think they're Romeo and Juliet. Then when peace comes, they find they're just Charlie and Maude after all. - Now, wait a minute. Are you for me or against me? - I'm for Jane. - Well, so am I. - I know that, lad. I'm only asking that you make sure she does love you, before you do anything rash. This story about your wife running off, is it true? - Of course it is, I wouldn't make up a yarn like that. - Well, I've known soldiers make up worse things to get what they want. - You know me better than that. - All the same, supposing it weren't true. Supposing you hadn't lost your foot. Do you think Jane would just be the same? - Of course she would. - I wonder. - Well, I'm sure of it. - Would be very interesting to find out. She's back in her own room now, all alone. - Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there? That's to ask. - Hello, Mark, so we're back at work again tomorrow. I'm not sorry, I'd rather have your father-in-law for a foreman than my missus. (chuckles) - Huh? - Don't excite yourself. (moody orchestral music) (knocks) - Mark. - No, it's me. - Oh, Jim. - Disappointed? What happened between you two this evening? - I told him I wanted a divorce and we were finished. - And yet you were hoping he'd come back? - Yes. No, no, no, I don't know what I'm saying anymore. Just take me away from here, please, Jim. - Well, I'm ready. But are you? - Yes. - Janie. Are you sure? Positive you'll have no regrets? - Of course not, darling, I want to get away. Don't you see? Once we get away from here, I'll forget about Mark and everything that's happened. - Yes. Yes, of course you will. - What's the matter, Jim? - Nothing, just thinking. - About what? - Janie, supposing... Supposing that story I told you about my wife wasn't true. - But it is true, isn't it? - No. (Jane chuckles) - I don't understand what you mean. - She's in London still. - She didn't run off with anybody? - No. - Are you separated? - We were living with her family. Our marriage was a mistake, for me anyway. You see, I never forgot you, I had to see you again. - She, she wants you to go back to her, I suppose? - Naturally. - Why don't you go? I won't keep you. - I've told you, I don't love her. I suppose she thought the baby would make everything all right. - Baby? - Yes, she's going to have one. Or so she says. - Is it so impossible, then? - Not impossible. But it's just a trick to get me back, I know her. Besides, what difference does it make? - What difference? - I love you, Janie, that's all that matters. - But you lied to me, why? - I couldn't very well tell you I was happily married and going to have a baby now, could I? Besides, you're on the same boat. You want to leave your husband. Or don't you? - No, Jim, I only thought I wanted to. I don't think I ever did want to, really. - Well. That's that. - Yes, Jim. Please go now. - All right. If that's the way you want it. (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, Jim? - You and your supposing. - Was I right? - I was a fool to let you talk me into doing that. - I know, lad. - And I wouldn't do it again for a VC. - What're you going to do now? - Go to Newcastle. The job starts next week, and I've yet to find a home for my family. - Family? - Oh, of course, you haven't heard. I just got my wife back, and a baby. - (chuckles) So, that's how you did it. Well, well, well. - Where's Mom? - Upstairs with your dad. - I can't talk to her there! - Well, you can't talk to her here! Get out, go on. (door closes) So, we shan't be seeing you again, Jim? - No. No, the trouble is, Granddad, I've hurt her. The last person in the world I'd want to hurt. - Well, don't worry, she'll get over it, they always do. - Yes. But will I? - (chuckles) If I were you, I'd get me a nice rabbit pie. - What? - Nevermind. I'm going to miss you, Jim. - Granddad, say goodbye to Aunt Sarah for me and... Take care of Jane. - Wait a minute. Come here, lad. Look. I'd like you to take this as a souvenir. My own Demona Star. Egypt, 1896. First battle I ever fought in, with Kitchener, and old Churchill. - No, Granddad. - Go on, take it, take it. What you did today showed far more courage than I've ever had and St. Peter will never notice I'm improperly dressed. - Thanks. Sir. - Damn. I must be growing old. - Like a drink? - No, thanks, I've got one. - Pint of beer, George. - Coming up. - Are you going away? - Yeah. Jane said if you weren't doing anything tonight, she'd like to see you. I'd go, if I were you, comrade. - Thanks. Sucker. - Well, do you feel like making a night of it, laddie? - I always do! - Well, what're we waiting for? George, make that two more pints of beer. - Right. (melancholic orchestral music) - Jane? (music swells and intensifies) - Well, it'll be lovely having the house to ourselves again. I think I'll shift you in there, Granddad. - Oh, no, you won't. I'm keeping that front parlor for my Sunday-afternoon nap. We'll have a gas fire put in and sit there every blinking night. I'm fed up with keeping that room for weddings and funerals. - And it'll come in very useful for Herbert and Mary, because they've nowhere to do their courting when it's wet. - There you are, Mom. - Well, don't stand there looking so miserable, the pair of you, we've got good news. Jane and Mark have made it up and they're moving out. Now, what do you think of that? - Oh, it's marvelous! When are they going? - Oh, soon, I expect. It'll be like home-sweet-home again. - Mom... Mary and me is getting married. - What? - What? - Can we have the room? - You? Don't be daft. You ought to know what married life's like by now. No, you wait till you get a place of your own. - Well... That's the trouble, we can't, we need somewhere right away. - "Can't?" (suspenseful music) Herbert, what have you been up to? - Well, now their Agnes has had a baby, there's no room for Mary's bike. - Another full house and we start all over again! (group laughs) (dramatic orchestral music)
