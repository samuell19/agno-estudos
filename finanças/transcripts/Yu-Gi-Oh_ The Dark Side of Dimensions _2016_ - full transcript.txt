Anything in those scans? Well... For the last time... you're behind schedule. Speed up your progress or we'll find someone who can! Yes, sir! Faster, everyone! Work faster! I wonder... is this thing even really down here? Please, we're working as fast as we can... But, sir... huh? Big bro, it's Mokuba. Don't worry, we'll find it. Bye, Grandpa, gotta go. Wait one second, Yugi. What's up? Well, I was wondering... Wondering what? I'm kinda late. I was wondering about Tea, I haven't seen her lately. Uhh... Don't you two always walk to school together? Only little kids do that, Grandpa. Anyway, gotta run! Hey, there. Yugi! Tea. Hey! Hi. Hey. Great to see you! Sorry I kept you waiting. You didn't. Well, let's go! Aw, man... Uhh. How am I late for school again?! Rrr! Sorry, Joey! It's cool, Sanpei! Luckily, I skipped my morning shower! Whoa! Whoa! Don't you know the speed limit?! Nope, goin' too fast to see! Oh, you're so funny! Check it out. Bakura! Hey, over here! I baked this for you! I guess there's just something about that accent. Yugi! Yo, Tristan! How 'bout a lift, pal? Sure! Whoa! Whoa ! This is gonna be close! Thanks for holding the door, Jeeves! Why you... ! No way! You got in? That study abroad program's lucky to have you. But, aren't you a little scared? Well, to be a professional dancer, I can't be afraid to bite off more than I can chew! If you're as graceful as you are with those chopsticks... you'll make it for sure! I'm so proud that you're following your dreams, Tea. At least someone gets to. My Dad says that after I graduate... I'm gonna have to go work in his factory. Hmm. Chin up, bud, it could be worse... I knew a guy whose job was bein' a professional wrestling dummy! Okay, fine, that was me one summer. But I did learn some moves! I call this one... the sleepwich! Uncle, uncle! And you, Joey? You still plan to become a pro-duelist after school is over? You better believe it, I'll be the champion of the world in no time! There's no one out there who can stop me! Except our math teacher, who confiscated your Duel Disk for polishing it in class last week. Though it took guts to do it during our final exam. Your turn, Yugi... It's time to share. Tell the guys what your game plan is. Uh... sure, why not? I'm going to keep helping my Grandpa at the game shop but I'm gonna start creating my own games, too. I know it may sound a little cheesy, but maybe one day... we'll all be able to play one together... That would be lovely, Yugi. For sure! In fact, let's promise, when Yuge's game makes it big... We all meet up and play it, whadaya say, guys? I'm in! Yes, me too! When you say "big..." Don't worry... you'll do it. Just remember, your friends believe in you. Thanks. And... I believe... in you all too. Yeah, It is pretty good, but... my best trap card-- huh? What gives? That kid over there... in the corner... Who is he? You don't remember? I do... but then again... I know he's been in our class all year, but I can't remember his name. Am I crazy? Nah, you're just dumb. His name's... uh... Yes, what is it? Oh, I know... It's, uh... Uh, it's... Oh! I remember! Aigami! That's his name. Aigami? Oh, yeah, Aigami. How did I forget that? Right, Aigami... Take your seats, everyone. Sit down! Okay. Sorry. Well, Joey, hope you're happy, you got your Duel Disk back. Sure did! Though it could use another polish! Still... all good! Great. Hey, whatcha got your deck out for, Yuge? You wanna take me on in a duel? No... just thinking back. About what? About... him. You mean Atem? Uh... sorry. Just forget that I even brought it up. Yuge, it's okay... you guys shared a connection. It totally makes sense ya miss him sometimes. Not just sometimes. All the time. It's just that things ended so suddenly between us... You used to be a part of me, but then you weren't and we had to face each other in a duel. A duel to determine whether I was ready to stand on my own. And when I defeated you, you left us, you left me... forever. I know it was for the best, but I wish I just had one more chance... to let him know what he meant to me. But destiny had different plans for us. Uh-oh, trouble! Huh? What is it, Joey? Smile bright, Aigami... After all, you're the star of my how-to film on bullying! Please, please, stop! 'Fraid not-- only I get to yell "Cut!" Oh, yeah?! Aah...! Oof! That was on purpose! Joey Wheeler! What do you want?! A fight if you don't let him go! Aah... you... meet at the old factory tonight or else. Come alone. Later, loser. Hmph! Unh. Whoa, Aigami! You all right? I am now... thanks to you, that is. Thanks for stepping in there. Everything okay?! You're Joey, right? And Tea... ? And you... you're Yugi Muto... Isn't that right? Yeah... but... Don't we already know each other? Yes... but of course. Thanks again. Hold up! If those mouth-breathing bullies give you any more trouble... We can help. Just say the word! Thank you... but I'll be fine. Well, he ain't much for words. So how do we know and not know him at the same time? Yeah... wish I had a good answer. Same here. No worries. At least there's always one thing that's certain... I'm starving! Whadaya say we go get some dirty water dogs? Yugi's treat. Or Tea's. Or I guess we could call up Tristan. Uhh. I don't believe it! The dunce actually showed! Bad move. Now then... whadaya say we get back to makin' our film? I believe we were at the part... where you start crying like a baby. If he don't cry, Scud, we got ways to make him. And it don't involve... an onion. Huh? Huh? Why are you laughing? We're serious about the onion! I, I mean it! I'm certain you do. And that is why you must vanish. Huh? Do you... h-have a ... wand or something? What I have is the power to change your pathetic world into someplace grand... someplace you don't deserve to exist. Who are you? Even worse, who are they?! Who they are will be made clear soon enough. But I'm afraid you won't be around long enough to learn this truth. Look... I'm sorry... Please, just let me go! Oh, yes, you'll be going all right. To another dimension more fitting for you. What's happening to me?! Uh... you don't look so good. Oh, no, Scud! He's history! No... history is remembered. I've been waiting for you... Pharaoh! Today we settle things once and for all. Hmph. I take that to mean you want to duel... Kaiba. I certainly didn't go to all the trouble of bringing you here to ask you to dance. Yes, we'll duel. And we'll do so with my new, bleeding-edge, beyond state-of-the-art Duel Disk! I've been waiting for this a long time, Pharaoh! Now... prepare to do battle! And prepare to lose! Oh, I see you're just as cocky as ever, Kaiba, but so be it... It's time to duel! Let's begin! Let's begin! I'll go first... I draw! Hmm. I warned you to prepare for battle, Pharaoh... but there's no preparing for this! I Fusion Summon! Behold, Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon! Your turn, Pharaoh. Fine, Kaiba. I draw! First I activate the spell card Dark Magic Veil! Then by using my life points... I can summon... My most ardent ally, Dark Magician! Next, I'll play Thousand Knives And give your Ultimate Dragon an ultimate shredding! I don't think so! I play my trap! Dark Sacrifice gives your Knives a new monster to mince! Huh, not bad, Kaiba. Got that right. Since you failed to destroy Neo Blue-Eyes, it can now attack! And Dark Magician will be its first victim! You have no monsters to protect you, Pharaoh. You're through! Wrong! Huh? I activated the trap Time Chain. Not only does my Dark Magician survive your attack, but both he and your Dragon are locked out of this duel for two turns. You're just prolonging the inevitable, I will beat you! You've been saying that for years, Kaiba. I summon Celtic Guard of Noble Arms and Celtic Guardian! Pharaoh... you don't know how long I've been waiting to battle you. The things I've had to do to make it possible. But for me, there never was a choice. After all, my scars of defeat run deep, Pharaoh. Scars you inflicted upon me... And though they may never go away, something can be done to make them easier to live with. Inflict upon your enemy an even greater wound, a defeat so resounding it leaves their soul completely crushed! You're the closest I've ever had to a worthy adversary. But you aren't worthy. And I'm finally going to prove it! Two turns have passed, Kaiba, so Dark Magician is released from the ties that bind him! But there's more. I play Magical Dimension! Celtic Guard of Noble Arms, lend me your strength, and I'll use that strength for... Dark Magician Girl! And with her arrival comes your monster's departure! Now go! Double Dark Magic Attack! Aah...! Don't you dare! Unless you want to fall prey to my Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon! That's right. Call off your attack! Heh. You could never stand up to my power. Not then, not now. And with this power... I will crush you! I beg to differ. Hah. Go! Dimension Reflector! By banishing my two magicians, this trap transforms into a Mirror Monster with the same attack points as your Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon! But here's the best part, you then take damage... equal to those same attack points! You set me up. It's over, Kaiba! Huh? But I knew you'd set me up so I had this ready... the Trap Enhanced Counter. Too bad, Pharaoh... The damage you sent my way increases my monster's attack points instead. That means... Yes... it means that after all this time... I will finally have my revenge! Attack! Hyper Neutron Blast! Well done, Mr. Kaiba! A success on every level. You should be proud. I am. The Duel Link Solidvision System is a technological marvel. It's far superior to any design that's come before it. It's sleeker, more precise. It gives me real-time data from Kaibacorp's Crystal Cloud Network, and when used in tandem with my new Duel Disk, it gives life to all the cards I've collected through the years. It can even give life to my very thoughts! After all, since it's directly connected with my brain, anything I imagine can become a reality. Just as you all witnessed with the Pharaoh. He proved to be an exact replica. And you defeated him soundly, sir. I concur, it was no contest. Quiet, you sniveling sycophants! It's true, I went to a great deal of trouble recreating the Pharaoh's deck, strategies, even his perfectly coiffed hair. In fact, that part is what took the longest. But still... it wasn't the real Pharaoh, so I didn't really beat him. And until I do, my scars of defeat will continue to burn! Fire whoever designed that bottle. Kaibacorp products shouldn't bend that easily. Yes, understood! I will face you, Pharaoh. You can't hide forever. Hmm? Seto! Seto! I got some good news, bro! We found it! Pharaoh. Hey, there. Super cute, like movie star cute. You're a big dog! He's trained. Tristan, isn't that Joey's Duel Disk? You got serious guts taking it apart like that! Nah, it's cool, Duke-- it's been acting up so he asked me to fix it. Hey, what are you looking at there, Yugi? What? Oh... This article... Wait... it's those bullies. Says here that they all just disappeared without a trace. And they're still missing? Mm-hmm. Gets worse, the article says there's been a whole bunch of these cases all around here! Not just here, the whole world. I saw online something about 50 people vanishing all at once. What? No way. Anyway, enjoy your lunch! Thank you, Duke, we'll try... But how do you enjoy your lunch knowing someone's out there taking people? That someone could be watching us right now. True... but I think they're all pretty harmless, Bakura... Look. Huh? Hi, Bakura! Hi! It's the accent, gets 'em every time! Attention, people of Domino! Huh? Huh? It is I, Seto Kaiba! And once again, I am about to change your lives! With the next generation of Duel Disk... your reality will become even more real. You're welcome, Domino! You're welcome world! A brand-new Duel Disk?! Looks pretty cool... and pricey. Ya just know that jerk Kaiba's gonna charge a fortune for it. No problem, you'll just have to man up and work some overtime. Or should I say dog up? Hey! What have you done with my Duel Disk, Tristan?! You broke it! Huh? And... 'cause you did... you owe me! Owe you? You asked me to fix it! And now I'm askin'... for a new one! Guys, chill out already. Hey! Beat it, ya mutt! You need to be put back on a leash! No! My balloon! Way to go. Hey! Wheeler! I've told you... no clowning around here! This job isn't a joke! Selling ice cream is not a laughing matter! You've turned my business into a circus! When the Pharaoh leaves this world, the power of the Plana will be granted. But should he ever return, this power will be recanted. Our dear master Shin told us this prophecy, a prophecy that has come true. When Yugi sent the Pharaoh to the great beyond, we attained the Plana, the magic to remake the very fiber of reality. And I shall wield this power to avenge you... Master Shin. No, Diva. Do not let your emotions control you. But what happened to Master Shin cannot be forgiven. You must forgive. You must not forgive. You must resist your dark urges. Good cannot grow from evil. That is what Master Shin taught you. Or have you forgotten his teachings? Not for a single moment. Even now his words still echo... But so do the memories of what happened that fateful night and the days that led to it. I cannot, I will not forget them. They remind me that I must make him pay for what he did to Master Shin. And since he's in Domino... that's where I must go! No, Diva! Come back! Diva... Diva! It's not too late to change your mind. My friend, I doubt Master Shin would desire revenge. This is not revenge, Manny. This is simply doing what is right and just. Come now, Diva, you know that's not so. I must do what I must do. But at what cost? At any cost. Understand, Manny. There is nothing wrong with eradicating evil. And no one is more evil than him! But, Diva... It's been found! Just as we feared! Oh! Mr. Kaiba has arrived! Hey there, bro! You grace us with your presence, sir! Have all the pieces been accounted for? Each and every one, sir! So this is it... the spot where the Pharaoh and little Yugi Muto had their final duel. Where the Pharaoh left this world. As you requested sir, the pieces were placed in our most sophisticated security apparatus so that no one would disturb them before your arrival. Motion sensor technology, reinforced puncture proof glass, I can assure you, no expense was spared. Load it into the chopper at once. I plan to reassemble it today. Right away sir! Reassemble it? You do realize it took Yugi eight years to complete the puzzle, don't you? That's because Yugi's a simple-minded child. Let's go! Sorry, sir. The system's on a time delay for extra security. It'll be a moment. In that case, why don't you introduce yourself? We have a visitor with us, Mokuba. That's right. I know you're here. So show yourself, Aigami. Or would you prefer your other nomenclature, Diva. You know my real name. Most impressive, Seto Kaiba. But I'd expect no less! So nice to meet you. My network of security tech says that you were in the town of Domino minutes ago. How is it you're suddenly here? With a power you can't possibly comprehend. It's a kind of magic... the same magic these others have used to arrive here. And unlike your tech, magic has no limits. What's this guy's deal? I assume you're here to take the Millennium Puzzle. Make that my Millennium Puzzle. Oh, it's yours, is it? We'll see about that. No, we won't. No false moves, kid. Whoa! You got me! Or... do you? Stop, now! But there is no stopping us, for we wield the power of the Plana. And this is what happens when you meddle with us! I gotta be dreaming! This isn't happening! Help me! Stop! What are you doing?! Nothing much. I'm just sending him away... to a dimension that he may not enjoy. For you see, we are the Plana... the next evolution of enlightenment, a collective of souls who will rid this world of all evil. They are wise to run, but at the same time, foolhardy because there is no escape from what's coming. Not for them and most certainly not for you, Seto Kaiba. Because let's be truthful, you're the worst of them all. You have gone to great lengths to create your very own collective. One where everyone serves you, whether they be a consumer... or an employee. You want to control everything. But no matter, it's all coming to an end. And as you just saw, we've already begun... banishing evil ones to an alternate dimension... where they will receive just what they deserve. Those reports about people vanishing all over the world... they must be 'cause of him! Ah, so you know my work. And we won't rest until every evil soul in this world suffers that same fate. But don't take my word for it, Kaiba... See for yourself, after all, you're next up on our list! Farewell, Kaiba... and good riddance! Seto, no! I think not! No one orders around Seto Kaiba! No one!! What? What's happening? He survived? Diva... how is this possible? The Plana is all-powerful. He should not have been able to repel it. Aah! You said tech has its limits. Wrong. There are no limits when you're as brilliant as Seto Kaiba! Clever... however... I cannot permit you to resurrect the Pharaoh. Please. You can't stop me. Perhaps not like the others, but I have alternate methods at my disposal... such as my cards. As do I... so cease your brainless stammering and let's get on with it! I was hoping you'd feel that way. Yes, let us duel... but this duel, Seto Kaiba... ...will be unlike any you've ever had before! What's going on?! Mr. Mokuba, look up! What's that? Be careful, Diva. Kaiba is a formidable adversary... Let's duel! Let's duel! I'll do the honors... I draw!!! What's this?! I can summon my high-level monsters without paying any cost? Correct. In this duel, you won't be summoning monsters in the normal fashion. You'll be Dimension Summoning. Furthermore, you are allowed to choose how many attack and defense points each of your monsters have. And how do I do that exactly? By infusing your spirit energy. But you can't exceed your monster's original point total. Fine then. These new rules will make crushing you simpler than before! Here goes! I Dimension Summon! Rise up! Krystal Dragon! Then... I'll end with these! I see you've spirited your monster's attack points to the max, but... there's something you should know. In a dimension duel... if your monster's destroyed, you don't take battle damage... you take damage equal... to its attack points! Speaking of monsters, it's time to bring out one of mine. And as you can see, it's a looker! Feast your eyes on, Vijam the Cubic Seed! You're keeping its attack points at zero? Correct, Seto Kaiba... I end my turn. Not surprising. You cower from power... while I... embrace it! I summon another Krystal Dragon! Now... attack Vijam! Where'd it go? To another dimension that's well out of your Krystal Dragon's range of attack. And there's more... No way! This is what happens when a monster attacks Vijam. It loses its special abilities and its ability to attack. So you've neutralized it. Guess it's a good thing... I have a spare ready to go! Not for long... not with my trap card! Cubic Ascension summons another Vijam that you're forced to attack! Now both your dragons are out of commission. You're wrong! Behold... I activate... Dragon's Orb! This trap card not only restores Krystal Dragon's abilities, but I also get to draw... two Blue-Eyes out from my deck! You know... why should I stop at two Blue-Eyes... when I can Dimension Summon a third one! Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon! Unleash your rage, Blue Eyes... Blue Lightning! Not bad. Ohh! But unfortunately... Just before your attack landed, I played the trap Cubic Rebirth. Not only does it negate your attack... it also allows me to summon yet another Vijam. Oh, but fortunately for you, you get to summon the two Blue-Eyes in your hand. Oh, wait. Did I say "fortunately"? I lied. They suffer the same fate as your other dragons! Fine. Upset? Then I've got bad news... you really won't like this! I Dimension Summon! Say goodbye for now to one of my Vijam's... and hello to Dark Garnex the Cubic Beast! Whoa! His monster transformed? Yes. Dark Garnex absorbed Vijam's essence to gain 1000 attack points. Attack points it'll use to great effect! With your dragon gone, my Cubic Beast transforms back into Vijam, but... the fun isn't over. Know why? Because I'm combining and transforming more Vijams! Forge into a new Cubic Beast! A Cubic Beast that is twice as powerful! Blade Garoodia! It destroys two more of your monsters. As your dragons fall one after another, so do any hopes of you winning this duel! Face it. You are finished! I use all three of my Vijams to Dimension Summon once more! Emerge, Buster Gundil the Cubic Behemoth! This monster can attack three times. First, shatter his Krystal Dragons! No! No! No, Seto! Aaah! Agh! Ohh. And with this final attack... there will be nothing left of you! Farewell! I play my trap! Go Counter Gate! What's this?! It stops your attack and I get to draw a card. And if I should happen to draw a monster card... I get to summon it. That won't be happening. I play my trap! Cubic Mandala! It returns all your dragons from your graveyard back to your field so you have no room to summon a new monster! Aww, they don't look so healthy, do they? It means they've lost their special abilities! In other words, you lose! Can't be... No... this won't be how it ends. Not after everything I've done. Not after all the sacrifices I've made. Not when I'm so close to reviving the Pharaoh. I will duel him again! What trickery is this?! I draw! What's happening?! Aah! It's Obelisk the Tormentor! An Egyptian God Card! But how?! Those no longer exist! This can't be. When the Pharaoh left this realm, so did the Egyptian God Cards. Do my eyes deceive me? How did Kaiba make the impossible possible and raise from the ancient beyond one of the Pharaoh's mightiest monsters? I activate... Obelisk's... ability! By destroying all of my monsters, you take damage equal to Obelisk's attack points! But your monster can't use its abilities! It's no monster... it's a god! Attack with Fist of Fury! All right! Huh? Uhh! Kaiba... I'm still standing! Big bro! We're all set! Let's go! Oh, no, the puzzle! The boy's escaping with it! Later! I don't think so. Aigami! To be continued. Hmm. I-I don't believe it... Can it really be? Huh? Whoa, did I... oversleep? This is not my pillow! Kaiba?! You're not my pillow either! Hey! That there on your arm, is that the new Duel Disk? Yes... it is... but you can't have it! You're not worthy! I am so! Hey! Stop laughing! I am, so, worthy! I am, sooooooo... Uh... I am so... dreaming? Wake up... or I'll make it a nightmare! Anyway, back to what I was saying... "And though we may be going our own way..." Why do we gotta rehearse our graduation anyhow? Hey, show some respect. Respect for who? No one's really listenin', right, T? Tissues! I need tissues! Diva. Diva! Sera. I'm told you battled against Kaiba. Yes. I'm afraid he's located the Millennium Puzzle. If he's able to reassemble it... I know. The Pharaoh will rise. But don't worry. He won't reassemble the puzzle. He can't. And even if he could, it would not matter. What do you mean? We'll lose our powers when the Pharaoh resurrects in Yugi's body. That won't be a problem if I get rid of the body. You're going too far! You're blinded by hate, brother, and if you don't stop, it will destroy you. I still believe in you. Just consider what I've said, brother. I beg you. It's too late. Nah, seriously, Yuge, I heard the whole speech! So, now that rehearsal's over, you guys wanna chill? Hey... Yugi! Awesome! No coming back from that! Hooray! Fun! Hey, Aigami. Check it out! Whadaya think? Wow, it's a Red-Eyes! Yeah, me and this card have been on some adventures! Hey, what about you? Do you like dueling, Aigami? Mm-hmm, but I'm pretty bad. Maybe Yugi can give you some pointers. Yeah, totally, he's really good, he even beat Seto Kaiba! My! That's impressive! That settles it then. You and Yugi ought to make plans to duel sometime. What? Me versus Yugi? I don't know. It's fine, Aigami. Don't feel pressured... No... I mean, if you're willing... then, yes... I'd love to duel you. Awesome! And whoever wins faces this guy! Now that's a grand prize worth fightin' for! I have an even better idea. Why don't we all get together later and have a tournament? Yeah! I'll be there! Be ready to lose too, 'cause I'm taking you down! This'll be fun! The elevator is on standby at the ground terminal. Earth port orbit angle at 90 degrees west longitude. Gravitational field stable. All systems are go. Repeat, all systems are go. The preparations are complete, Mr. Kaiba. All is set. Then I'm going to the station. Roland, while I'm away, plan for a duel exhibition. I want to give Domino a demonstration of my new Duel Disk. Sir! I want it big. The biggest Domino has ever seen! Greetings, Master Kaiba! I've been expecting you. The machine is ready. Then let's get to work. Affirmative. The puzzle reconstruction device uses a three-dimensional multi-grid interlacing laser scanner to analyze each puzzle piece and simulate various compositional patterns and potential matches with other pieces. By utilizing the zero gravity chamber, we will have a full cross-sectional rendering for each piece from every angle at well beyond a sub-atomic level. Don't you think I know that? I invented the blasted thing! Affirmative. But my AI has recognized your affinity for being reminded of your genius. At the current rate of assembly, the Millennium Puzzle will be completed in approximately five hours, 49 minutes, 37 seconds, 43 milliseconds-- Yes, yes, I get the point. And very soon... I'll get my glory. I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to dueling Yugi. I've thought of nothing else all day. It's going to be such fun, I'm sure. Hey, Aigami... what's with the cube? This? Well... it's precious to me. Like your Duel Disk is to you. It looks like an antique. Yes, that's because it is. Someone very special gave this to me. You know, Aigami... my father happened to be an antiques dealer. He and I travelled all over the world together. In fact, before we settled down here, we were living over in Egypt. Egypt? You don't say. Tell me more... Bakura. Oh, and don't forget to lock up! No way could I build a deck without this card! You've gotten me out of more dueling jams than I can count! It's lovely. That golden box. It has a kind of glow. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. But... you're right. This box is very special. You see... it's where I keep my duel cards. Not every one of them, of course, just the ones that are extra precious to me. Of course, but I think you mean cards extra precious to you... and extra precious to the Pharaoh. Oh! I know, Yugi. I know of the Pharaoh because of my master... Master Shin... Shadi Shin. Hmm! Not long ago, Master Shin bestowed on myself and others a great power. the power... of the Plana. This power is so strong, it can remake this world, turn it into someplace beautiful. A utopia. Oh! But if misused, this power could do the opposite. Where are we? This is the gathering place of the Plana. Plana? We are the ones who carry on the will of Master Shin. But there is dissension among us. And it could mean trouble for all of mankind. I have no one else to turn to other than you, Yugi. Who are you? I am Sera. Destiny has led me to you. So I shall entrust you with my destiny. Ohh... Whoa! That was... so strange. No way! Master Kaiba, it is impossible to reconstruct the Millennium Puzzle any further. There's no such thing as impossible. Stop making excuses and finish it! Negative. Pieces required to complete assembly are missing. Ahh! Diva. He'll pay. I... don't feel well. Uh, what was that? Are you okay, Bakura? Please. You were saying... about Egypt? Uh... my... I... don't want to relive that memory. My father received word that an artifact he'd been searching for was in a place called the Valley of the Kings. It was a special artifact. One that he'd been looking for all his life. So he set off for this valley to acquire it. For some reason, I was worried about his journey, so I secretly followed him. I remember the sky. So peaceful, so clear. No... why am I talking about this? I don't want to revisit the terrible things that happened that night! Bakura! What's going on? Talk to me, pal! Hey, what the... Uh... we take a wrong turn somewhere? I know... I'm dreamin' again! Or maybe nightmarin' is a better word. This is no dream or nightmare. What you are experiencing right now... is a result of we, the Plana. Our powers are transforming your world right before you. Your powers? Aigami, what are you talking about?! Ahhh, yes. I forgot, you're the slow one, aren't you? All you need to know is I need you gone. I ain't goin' nowhere! Grr... You and your goons don't scare me none. But we are outnumbered. Bakura! Get up! We gotta get outta here! He's zonked! 'Cause a' you! Rrr! Violence, huh? That's so very typical of your kind. Kind? And that's why, Joey... you'll now be banished like all of the rest. Prepare to enter into a world more fitting to your primitive sensibilities. A dimension that reflects your own feeble soul! And in this world, Joey... you will forever stay! That's enough outta you! I... I can't move. Farewell, Joey! Now... be gone! A piece of the Millennium Puzzle... It's getting late. Where is everyone? Hey, Tristan! Yugi, the playdate is cancelled! Wha... Come on, something's happened to Joey! Uhh... Huh?! Huh? Wha?! Where... am I? Oh, back here. Looks like things are normal again. Or are they? Huh? What's wrong, Joey? You look scared. Why, you-- Aigami! What gives?! You're trapped in a world made up of your own thoughts. An alternate dimension from which there is no escape. No way, my world would have less traffic! You're not making this world, Joey. Your memories are. This place, this reality only exists as long as your memories do. But what do you actually remember, Joey? Do you remember your first breath? Your first laugh? Do you remember everything you see? Every scent? Every touch? No wonder you're alone and isolated in surroundings so colorless and dull. Quit your yappin'! I'm gettin' outta here! Run as fast as you can. There is no escape. The power of the Plana is absolute and no memory you have is strong enough to survive it! Even now, the blinding radiance of our power spreads. The only thing you're spreadin' is the crazy, pal! And I don't want any! What you want is irrelevant. Here, you only have what you brought with you. And anything you forget is gone forever. Man, how long is this street anyway? For someone as weak and simple-minded as you, Joey? Not too much longer. It will end as soon as you stop resisting your fate. Whatever, chump! I may not be an A student, or even a C student, but that don't mean I can't remember stuff! Like that's Sanpei's Grocery Store over there! Sanpei, where ya going? You're a fool, Joey... Do you really think you can win a battle of wills with me? No one here knows you exist. And as we speak, I will erase these memories one by one. Every face you've seen. Every day you've known. Terminated! And since a man is nothing without his memories, once they're all gone, you'll be gone, too! Farewell. It's just not like Joey... He'd never abandon his Duel Disk. Totally, there's no chance he'd leave this behind. I spoke with Joey earlier in the day and he said he was hanging out with Bakura and Aigami. If we find them, we might find him! Bakura, you said you didn't want to relive the terrible things that happened that night in Egypt. Well, I don't blame you... because I was there and I can promise you it haunts my memories even more than yours! Master Shin, tell us again why you chose us. Because... as children you can understand things in a way no adult ever can. I don't get it. Yeah... I mean... So what if we're children, Master Shin? How does that make us understand things differently? You see, Diva... a child's judgment has not yet been consumed by fear. So fear... is bad? That is correct, because fear... turns into hate. Umm... I still don't get it. Why does fear turn into hate? Because... fear tricks and clouds your judgment. Oh, I think I know what you're saying now. When someone is scared, they can forget to do the right thing and lash out... and end up angry at the whole world. Very good, young one. And they often take out this anger in the form of aggression. Sadly, this has been the cause of the world's failings for millennia. Don't worry about me! Ever since you saved me, I haven't felt a moment of fear! And as long as I'm with you, I'll never feel fear again! Young one, that is the very definition of fear. It is? My children... please, listen closely. When the seven treasures are inserted into the Pharaoh's stone, the door to the afterlife will open, and the Pharaoh's soul will finally be able to move on. When this happens, young ones... the Plana's power will be yours to wield... and wield as you see fit. Which is why I teach you these lessons. Because I may not always be here to give you guidance. My hope, however, is that I will remain in your hearts. And now, young ones, there is one last matter. It is not a lesson but a warning. And one you must always remember. When the Pharaoh leaves this world, the power of the Plana will be granted. But... should he ever return... this power will be recanted. Ohh... Yes, master... Oh! Huh? Young ones... stay and do not follow. At last... I've finally found this place! And there it is! The Ancient Stone! And just as the ancient texts said, the Golden Ring is inside it! Whatever you want, I'll pay it! Just tell me what your price is and I'll see to it! I must have that ring! You are mistaken. The Millennium Ring is not an object one can possess. It possesses you. It has powers that even I do not fully understand. Great and terrible powers. So? I do not care! I've been searching for it my whole life! Please sir! It is not my place to interfere... with what destiny has in store. You've been warned. But if you still want the ring, it's yours. Yes, yes, yes, I want it! What must I do?! Go take the ring and place it around your neck. Yes... yes... It will decide if you are worthy. It feels amazing! Like nothing I've ever experienced! No! Papa! Papa. The ring. Where is it? Where? There. I'll go get it! Oh, no! Are you all right? Shadi, your services will no longer be required. Now be gone, old man! No! Master Shin! Master Shin! Are you okay?! Say something! Remember, young ones... do not give into your fears, do not give into hate. One day, the seven treasures will become one with the Pharaoh's stone... you must be ready... you must find harmony between the forces of good and evil like the most precious of these treasures. Hold on, Master Shin! Please hold on! Diva... take this. When the time comes, use it to wield the power of the Plana. You must carry it now, for my time in this world... is complete. Don't leave us! Please come back. Don't waste all your tears on him... You really ought to save some for each other! I like this new host body. I think we'll be able to do all kinds of terrible things together. That's right... it was you, Bakura. Please, Aigami... just listen to me-- I don't want to listen... What I want is to avenge my master! I know... but it wasn't my fault. The ring did it, not me. You lie! You're just trying to save yourself but it will not work! I'm not lying! The ring used to control me, but it no longer does! Still... I am so sorry... It's not easy to lose someone. I know because I lost someone as well on that day. So you did... This isn't good! It's like my memories are vanishing faster than before! There's gotta be something I can do to stand up to this. Great, now I can't even stand. My foot! Ahh! No, it can't end like this! It just can't! Aigami... please forgive me. Stay away! You're the enemy! Bakura, you ruined my life. Yes, he did. Oh! He ruined all of our lives, Diva. Manny? Now do it. Take revenge on Bakura. You're acting strange, Manny. If you won't, I will. Heh, I'm going to enjoy this, Bakura. No, Manny, wait, this isn't like you! But it is. The new me. Impossible! Is that the Millennium Ring? But how? I found it. I came upon it at the shrine after your duel with Seto Kaiba. Manny, listen to me... The ring has done something to you! Something bad. But it feels so good! Manny! Diva... You are right. The ring's infected my soul. I'm trying to fight it but... it is so very strong... Manny! Manny! I'm coming! Manny... I'm here. I'm right here with you. Must I lose everything? Master Shin... now Manny. Who's next? All that's left behind is this Millennium Ring. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Looking for someone? Hello, Yugi. Aigami? What's going on? Aigami... who are you? There is no Aigami. I'm Diva and we are the Plana, and... we are not ones to be trifled with. Yeah? Then spill what ya did with Joey! I sent him away to another dimension, to a world from which he will not be returning. You should know that your friend Bakura is long gone, as well. Ahh! Ohh! And you'll be joining them soon. It's your fate. The fate of all who oppose me. We'll stop you! That's just it. There is no stopping us. Our power is too great. And once I banish you, vessel of the Pharaoh... it will at long last be absolute. Not gonna happen. Guess this really is it. No more running... no more crawling... so long world... so long everything... Guess... Joey's signin' off. Is that... Ohh! No way! Ohh! Are you okay?! Hey, it's you guys! I'm back? I am and I'm all right! That's good. But... how?! You should be long gone by now! You should be nothing! I'll tell ya how... some 'a my memories... are forever! And that includes those of my three pals here! Their friendship withstood the power of the Plana? How is that possible? Where did Diva go wrong? That's right! Go back to wherever you all came from! But not you, Aigami, not 'til you hand over Bakura! This changes nothing, your fates are all still sealed! Including Bakura's. 'Til next time. Wait, stop! He's gone, Joey... We'll find Bakura ourselves. Hope he's somewhere we can find him! Split up! Right! Good luck! Bakura! Yugi, wait! I just... wanna say... Thank you. That's all. Uh, you're welcome, I guess? I don't understand. The power of the Plana is supposed to be the greatest force in the universe... Diva... did you really think you could get away with stealing the last two pieces of the Millennium Puzzle? Ha. You noticed earlier than I thought you would. And now this... a Deprivation Mask. Clever, now I can't communicate with the Plana. That's right, Diva. Your team of glowy-eyed goons can sit this one out. Take him away! My cardio stinks. Kaiba? What are you doing here? Good to see you, too. Not long from now, I'll be introducing my new Duel Disk, and to mark the occasion, I'll be holding a tournament the likes of which has never been seen. And you will be taking part in this tournament, Yugi. I have bigger issues to deal with! No way! The Millennium Puzzle? That's right. Most of it anyway. But you can be sure that I'll have it in its entirety soon enough. How did you get it? That's not important. Yugi... you'll come to my tournament. And bring the puzzle piece that you have. Huh? You know? But how could you? I know everything that goes on in Domino. What is it? What are you after? The same thing I've always been after. To show the Pharaoh... that I'm the greatest! You will wear the puzzle again and summon him, Yugi. Then I will duel him... and I will defeat him! But... Kaiba... Be honest, Yugi. I know you want to see him too. Hey, Yugi! Long time no see! Looking good down there! I have Diva. Oh! I have Diva. he'll duel in the tournament as well. And I'll win those puzzle pieces from the both of you in front of the whole world! I'll be seeing you again soon, Yugi, and after I beat you, I'll be seeing the Pharaoh! My box! Yugi. But I... How'd I get here? Sera... I have to know... why did you give me this puzzle piece? I entrusted you with that piece for one reason... it may be the only way to save my brother Diva. Brother? He's giving into fear and anger. He's losing his way. But those who are lost don't always have to stay that way. He wasn't always like this... but our lives have been full of challenges that could darken even the strongest of hearts. Please, Yugi. Please save my brother. He is all that I have. Please help him remember who he once was. Sera, where are you? Where are you, Sera? Sera? Help! Hey, what's the big idea kid?! Little brat. Check your wallet. Sorry. I'm here. Lousy beggars. Pretending to be poor to get some money. Now come, we have plenty more stops on our tour. Thanks, Sera. Of course, brother... Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Wakey, wakey, Diva. Nice pad. you're on my bro's turf now so I'd cooperate. Let's begin. First off... we've analyzed your cube. We know there's a piece of the Millennium Puzzle inside. But... what we don't know is how to get it out. Huh? Of course not, that requires true intellect. Your brother may build a decent Duel Disk... but when it comes to the way of the Plana, he doesn't have the first clue. And besides, even if you were able to extract the piece, you would still require the second one to complete the puzzle... and unfortunately for you and your idiot brother, I'm the only one who knows where it is. So maybe it's all of you who should start cooperating with me. Looks like you don't know everything. How's that? We're two steps ahead of you. We know where the second piece is and it's practically ours. No, you lie! Yeah, sometimes I do, but not now. Here... don't take my word for it. Look at this. Sera... no. Those jets are giving me goosebumps! Man, Joey, this is gonna be the duel of Yugi's life! Hope he's ready! Of course he is! He knows this might be the only way to get Bakura back! Huh?! Mayday! Mayday! Oh, no, look out! I gotta get out of here! What just happened? What's goin' on here?! Duelists from around the world, what you've just witnessed is but a taste of the technology possible with my new Duel Disk! That was a hologram? You owe me a new pair a' drawers, Kaiba! This is the start... of a new dueling era! An era where the only limits that we face... will be those put in place by our own imagination. For too long we've been forced to live in just this reality. It's tedious, poorly designed and pathetically constructed. If the one responsible was in my employ, I'd have him fired. I knew that I could do better... and with just a modicum of effort... there's no doubt I most certainly have! The time is now to grab the reins of the world, and utilize my new Duel Disk to create a future... where the ordinary can be extraordinary, the impossible, possible! I have never settled for mediocrity as an acceptable standard and neither should you! And when you wield my Duel Disk... you will find I've spared no expense to make sure you have pure tech perfection! So, world, this is my gift to you! Go out and grab it! And when you do attain it, the next time you catch yourself wondering about the great marvels of the universe... and who's responsible... you'll have an answer... Better yet, a name. And that name is... Seto... Kaiba! Now... on with the entertainment! Duelists, rise up! I've hand selected these two duelists because they're the best... which means they should give me at least a little bit of a fight before I crush them completely. Yugi... But this duel's about more than just winning or losing. Behold! The Millennium Puzzle! But it's incomplete, it's missing two pieces. And those two pieces are being held by the two duelists you see before you. Yugi?! But they're just keeping them warm until I take them. Brother, I'm sorry... But I couldn't tell you I gave my puzzle piece to Yugi Sera... you're all right. I'm glad but confused. I had to do something. Diva, can you not see the error of your ways? I can see fine. It is you who turns a blind eye to what must be done. Now let's get started. My first opponent... will be you, Diva! Wait, Kaiba! I am going to duel with Diva first! He and I have a score to settle! We do. Uh, this is my tournament! I call the shots! Not this time. I have a friend who's in trouble. And beating Diva may be the only way of helping him. You know me, Kaiba. you know I'll do anything for a friend. So back off! Or we're gonna have a problem! A threat? Sure, why not? Now what's it's gonna be, Kaiba? Yeah, Yuge! Very well, then... I will grant you this favor. But just this once. Then let's go. Well, well... Yugi. It was a long time coming. But we're finally having our duel. Listen, Diva. The piece of the puzzle... the one that your own sister gave me is inside. She's worried about you. Can't you just release my friend? Not happening. Very well, then you give me no choice. We'll settle this in a duel! Yugi! The new Duel Disk? Yeah, you'll need it. Now... it's time for you to battle! Ready! Then let's duel! Yes... let's. But first let us go to the realm of dimensions, Yugi! Seto! He's dimension dueling again! What's going on? What is this stuff? Don't get me wrong... I like pink, but whoa! What is going on?! What the... Please, Yugi. Please save him. Whoa. What are all these screens? Dimension dueling? Guess I'll have to learn as I play! Here goes... I draw! Okay... I infuse my spirit to Dimension Summon! Sentry Soldier of Stone! I place two cards facedown and end my turn. I hope you're a quick study, Yugi, because in this match... any mistake will cost you. I summon Vijam the Cubic Seed! Then I'll use Vijam... to Dimension Summon this. Take to the field... Geira Guile... the Cubic King! By itself, Geira Guile the Cubic King has zero attack points. But by absorbing Vijam, it gains 800. Plus, you lose 800 life points! Whirling Windstorm! Next I play the spell! Cubic Karma! Geira Guile absorbs two more Vijams to gain even more attack points! Attack Yugi's Sentry Soldier of Stone and pulverize it into rubble! And you take damage equal to its defense points! Oh, no! You triggered my trap. Dig of Destiny! Since I took battle damage, I get to draw a card! Draw a million cards if you want, Yugi. They won't help you. Not as long as I have my Cubic Monsters. They'll keep transforming into new and powerful forms! I Dimension Summon another Cubic King! Observe Vulcan Dragni the Cubic King! Say hello to Yugi, won't you? I don't think... he heard you! Attack him directly! Aaaagh! Why stop now? Next... my Cubic King will transform itself again. And reveal to you... its ultimate form! A form so powerful, it's no longer a mere king, it's become something even grander. Behold, Indiora Doom Volt the Cubic Emperor! Unh! Ohh! Not good. One more attack and Yugi's through! Farewell, vessel of the Pharaoh! And, Pharaoh, farewell to any chance of your return! Wrong. I send a monster to the graveyard to activate this trap! Silent Swordsman, cut the Emperor's attack points down to size! Unh! You are merely delaying your demise, Yugi! It's my turn! I draw! Please... Yes! I Dimension Summon a new monster! Lord Gaia the Fierce Knight! You max spirited your monster's attack points again? Go! Lance his Cubic Emperor! Your Cubic Emperor has been... dethroned. You can never truly get rid of my monsters. It split back into three Vijams. Correct. Then by sending Cubic Karma to my graveyard, I eliminate half your life points! Man. I can't watch. Fight, Yugi! Ignore your friends. The sensible move is to give up. Then I guess I don't have a lot of sense. I will never give up... not when I have a friend on the line! Friendship... your kind knows nothing of friendship, just of cruelty! And that is why you must be banished! Taking you down is the only way to guarantee the promise of the Plana! The promise of a better world... a world without hate. Can you even comprehend such a place? Where instead of using people, you are of use to them? Maybe you can, Yugi Muto. Maybe you are the exception. Maybe you should join us... and together we can remake this world into one without hate, where no one has to live a single moment of fear, a world of our own design. I'll never join you. Ohh! You say that we hate. Well, from what I've seen, that's all that fuels you. So there's no way you can create a world without it. Diva. Grr! You don't know what you're talking about, Yugi! You don't know what I've gone through. What I've seen. But perhaps you'll understand once I show you... I'm so tired, Diva. I know, Sera, it's been a long day. You must take me for a fool! Out all day and this is all you say you've earned?! No food for you! Or anyone! I'm sorry. It's my fault we're not eating tonight. No... you know that's not true. No matter how much money we bring back, it's never good enough. Yeah. But... if you're hungry, hug a pillow. It almost feels like you just had a big meal! Here... I prefer ice cream. Huh? Hey! What's so funny?! Oh, now you're not laughing, eh? That's what I thought! Fear not, children. I come in peace. And I bring with me wonderful news. You... are all free. Why you... Why can't... I move?! Those who have had the most wretched lives... deserve the most beautiful. Together we will create that beauty. Diva! Your brother is fine. As you all will be. People like you... are why I am here. You will harm no one else. Except you! You'll pay! Master Shin... he saved us all, and it won't be for nothing! I'll do whatever it takes for the Plana to survive! And no one's going to stop me! No, Diva. Serve me again, Indiora Doom Volt the Cubic Emperor! You may have gotten your Indiora back... but its return also powers up Lord Gaia! Rah! You know nothing of power! I play the spell Cubic Wave! While my monster's attack points are doubled, yours are cut in half! Aw, man. Oh! Fight! You're finished, Yugi! And with your defeat, so is Kaiba's plan to resurrect the Pharaoh! And I will never lose the power of the Plana! Cubic Emperor, attack and erase the vessel! I don't think so. What? We're not through... not at all. Go! The Trap Dimension Sphinx! Since your monster has over twice the attack points of mine... the difference is dealt to you as damage! But... so what?! My attack still ends you! Not when I play my second trap! Dimension Guardian! It keeps Gaia from being destroyed! Are you through?! Not yet! 'Cause now I play... my third trap card! A third trap? Dimension Mirage! Since you failed to destroy my monster, your monster is forced to attack again! Oh, no... That would mean... you trapped me! That's right. Indiora is caught in a perpetual attack loop! Which, thanks to my three trap cards, will result in you losing life points with every attack! And with no way to escape my combo, you know what that means. This duel between us is all but over. Diva, I know you fight for a cause and that you believe it's a noble one... but when you fight using hate to achieve peace... you've already lost. Hmm! Now for the sake of Bakura and for us all... I'm ending this! Master Shin... Yugi just won... Master... I've failed you. Ohh... The puzzle piece. Diva lost. The Pharaoh will resurrect. What will become of us? Stay calm everyone. The fate of our future is for Yugi to decide. Oh, man. That was a close one, huh? Okay, so Yugi won, but where's Bakura? What is that? What's that light? Is it him?! Ohh! 'Scuse me! Comin' through, guys! Pardon me! Bakura! You're okay! Whoa... where am I? With friends! Yuge! We got him! Ya did it! He's back! Yugi... the two puzzle pieces... you now have them both, yes? So, Kaiba... once again it's down to you and me... just like old times. No, you aren't the one that I want to duel, Yugi. I want the Pharaoh. You will complete the Millennium Puzzle and release the Pharaoh's spirit, bringing him back into your body. This is not a request. This matter is not up for debate. Listen to me, Kaiba. I understand how badly you want to battle Atem. I do. More than you know. But the reality is-- No more words! Yugi... if you won't release him willingly, I'll just have to force you! And, Pharaoh, if you can hear me, prepare to be crushed! Let's do this! Let's do this! Make your move, Yugi. Very well, Kaiba... I draw! I summon Marshmacaron in defense mode! Then I'll end my turn with two facedowns. Is that all? Fine then, it's my turn! Fly in, Assault Wyvern! Now, slice and dice that blob! That's much appreciated, Kaiba... 'Cause you've just created double the trouble for yourself! Hmm. Then let's give this a try... Assault Wyvern's ability allows me to summon the legendary Blue-Eyes White Dragon! Next I play Dragon's Fighting Spirit! My Blue-Eyes gains an additional attack... for every monster that you have out on the field! Now go, Blue Eyes, Triple White Lightning Attack! Unh! I activate Dark Horizon! I may have taken damage, but that has allowed me to summon my dear friend, Dark Magician! I look forward to destroying him. When I'm ready. It's your move, Yugi. Here goes! I draw! With this... I end my turn. A single facedown? Why, Yugi, it's like you're not even trying anymore. Blue-Eyes, attack! Now! I activate my trap! Metamorphortress! Can't get to me now, Kaiba Not with your Blue-Eyes. Lucky move. My turn! It's my Castle's turn to show... it packs a punch! Heh. You think you've taken things to the next level. Very well. You've given me no choice but to ritual summon and take things to the maximum level! You said I couldn't get to you with Blue-Eyes. Well, I can with this! Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon! What was it the Pharaoh used to say? Playtime is over? Well, soon it will be! Attack!!! When Chaos Max Dragon destroys a monster in defense mode, you still take damage, double the damage! Now, how's that for storming the castle? You haven't defeated me yet, Kaiba, because like Atem always taught me... I duel to the end! And it's not the end yet! I summon Apple Magician Girl! All right... if your monster is so tough... then let's see if it can take her down! You fight me with fruit? Don't mock me! Chaos Max Dragon, pulverize her! Thanks, because when Apple Magician Girl is attacked, she can bring out her friend! And this friend's bound to leave a sour taste in your mouth. She's Lemon Magician Girl! And your dragon's attack is diverted to her! But that's not all, she cuts the strength of your attack in half! Try making lemonade out of that! There's more. Like Apple Magician Girl, Lemon Magician Girl also calls up her friend! The one-and-only Dark Magician Girl! Zap away Chaos Max Dragon's attack points! You really hate dragons, don't you? But no matter how many dragons you destroy, they'll never go extinct! Watch as the Relentless arrives from the far reaches of light and space seeking vengeance! Witness Deep-Eyes White Dragon! Deep-Eyes inflicts damage for every dragon in my graveyard. Feel their wrath! I'm not done, Yugi. Deep-Eyes gets Chaos Max Dragon's attack points! I don't think even the Pharaoh can save you anymore! You're finished! I play my trap... Magician's Defense! The damage I take... is cut in half! Unh... Your move. Playing that trap card saved him, still... if Yugi doesn't do something this turn, he's finished! This is it, Kaiba. It's all or nothing. First I have to give you a card. So here... take this one! By doing so, I can activate the Spell Magical Contract Door. It lets me draw a new monster... and I'll summon it now! Break free from your iron prison! Gandora-X the Dragon of Demolition! Gandora-X's ability activates! It destroys any monster that I choose... and I choose Deep-Eyes! And you take damage equal to its attack points! Then Gandora-X gains the attack points of Deep-Eyes. Unh! No! Not if Deep Eyes takes Gandora down with it! Do you see now? Nothing will get in the way of me resurrecting the Pharaoh! But what if it's not up to you? Or me, for that matter. I tried to tell you, Kaiba, but maybe I need to show you instead... Yugi... Ahh! Uhh! Ohh! The ring? Help me, Sera! Help me! Master Shin! The Pharaoh... he has not returned. He's gone, Kaiba. Gone forever. I've known it deep down in my heart since we said goodbye. He's no longer inside the puzzle because we've gone our separate ways. It wasn't easy, it still isn't, but I had to let him go. And you have to as well. I'm sorry. But this was what destiny chose for us. You lie. He's just afraid! Scared to come out and face me! He knows he's no match for me... But it's not going to work, I'll beat him out of you! This trap lets me discard a spell card to activate it. Kaiba, wait, no! And the spell I'll activate... is the one you foolishly gave me! Monster Reborn! Return from the great beyond, Deep-Eyes White Dragon! This is it, Yugi, it's over! I activate the trap... Final Geas! All the monsters in both our graveyards are banished. But I'm allowed to bring one of them back! Him. Are you ready? I'm always ready. Hmm. Go, Dark Magician! Dark Magic Attack! Kaiba! Huh? That's Diva's cube. The Millennium Ring. What is this? Aah! Whoa. Not good. Diva, is that you?! Yes, it's me, dear sister. I'm back. And better than ever! Better or worse? W-what's happening to them? And what's coming out of that cube?! Diva? Oof... He's looked better. Diva! Diva, what are you doing? Diva? Diva is no longer in control. I am. His fear invited me into his soul. He has saved me! And by bonding the Millennium Ring's dark energies with his Cube... I'm stronger than anyone ever before! and now, at long last, sister... I will bring forth a perfect new world! The one we've been dreaming of! No... When used correctly, the Plana can create a world of beauty, full of peace and harmony. But if even a single drop of evil mixes in-- It will remake the world into a dimension of darkness! Such is the power of the Cube! Such is the power of the eighth Millennium Item! This isn't what we wanted. This isn't what the Plana is for! Please... you have to fight this, dear brother, for these poor souls and for Master Shin! Shin is my master no longer! That is why I did away with him. As I will do away with anyone who opposes me! Including you, dear sister! Look out! Diva... Sera! Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba... Now the fun shall truly begin! The darkness... it's devourin' everything! Yugi! Aah... You know... Huh? If I'm going down, it won't be without a fight. Do you mean...? Time to battle. Diva! Keep your paws off our dimension! We'll defeat you together! Aah... and save the world! Let's duel! Let's duel! A duel? Excellent idea. Why destroy you quickly when I can savor the experience slowly?! You will meet your doom, Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba! And it starts with this, Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord! Diva's willing to sacrifice his own life points if he can do damage to us as well. Fool! You lose more than life points! You lose your very life in this shadow game! I said I'd destroy you! And I meant it quite literally. Aah! We'll just see about that! Bring the pain, Pandemic Dragon! Yah...! And by paying 500 life points... Pandemic Dragon lowers your monster's attack points! And by weakening your monster, Pandemic Dragon automatically destroys it! Aah. None of my monster's abilities affected it. Be careful, Yugi. It's my turn! I Dimension Summon Silver Gadget! Aah...! And like every good gadget, it has a cool function, I get to summon Gold Gadget! Aah...! Then I'll end my turn with this! I expected more from you. It only makes this easier. Attack! Now! I play my trap! Metalhold the Moving Blockade, and you better believe it can hold some metal... my two Gadget Monsters, to be precise! Metalhold, load and fire your cannons! Pathetic. Aah! You're not the only one with traps, Yugi. And this brings two more Crimson Novas to join my ranks. I'm getting really tired of that laugh. Rip Pandemic Dragon apart! Huh. When my monster is destroyed, yours weakens. Ha! You harmed your own partner! Nice teamwork. Aah! I'm not finished! My Crimson Novas can attack you again... and this time, you have nothing to defend with! I have Spiritual Swords Of Revealing Light! It creates a barrier to protect us! However, the price of playing it is steep. 2,000 life points. All from me. Aah...! Yugi! It's cool, I'm okay. You won't be soon, Yugi, not when I activate yet another trap card! I channel all the hatred of the shadows with my Millennium Ring to fuse together my three Crimson Novas into the ultimate fiend of despair! Crimson Nova Trinity, the Dark Cubic Lord! 4500 attack points?! Crimson Nova Trinity can't attack unless you feed it life points. Life points that I take from you! Now, which of you pests shall be the first to perish? I choose... Yugi! Oh, no, you don't! Go, Krystal Avatar! Your attack switches to me! But, Kaiba... you won't survive this! Aah! Kaiba! Why did you do that? For him. The Pharaoh. Take this. Kaiba! Bring him back, Yugi. But, Kaiba... The Pharaoh's gone... Do not grieve for him. After all, Yugi Muto... you're about to be joining him! Feel our wrath! I send Clear Kuriboh to the graveyard so that I won't take any damage! That's not good enough, Yugi! Crimson Nova Trinity can still cut your life points in half! Face it. You've lost! The whole world has lost. And now a new world of darkness will commence! For all of eternity! Now, Yugi, be gone! I must keep fighting. I still believe... in the... heart of the... cards... No! What's this?! This... can't be! The Pharaoh has returned. Diva... Sera... what have I done? It wasn't you. But the Pharaoh did return... so... Our powers are gone. Manny. Diva. But it is for the best. Yugi... you actually saw the Pharaoh? Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it was great seeing him again. How's he doing? Good. So, like, be honest. He asked all about me, didn't he? Oh... Please! Sure he did. He wished us well. I said he'd be back. Oh! Hate to say I told you so but... told you so. You were right. I thought the Pharaoh would never return. But you never stopped believing. Hmm. You have your bond with him... and I have mine. Take care, Yugi... until our paths cross once again. See ya later! Till next time. Goodbye... and thank you! Big bro! The new Duel Disk numbers are in! It's a big hit! Thank you for the update, Mokuba... but I really need to concentrate right now. Big bro, are you sure you want to go through with this? We haven't even tested this prototype. It's too dangerous. Seto? Seto! It's time. Mokuba, you're in charge. Seto... promise you'll come back.
