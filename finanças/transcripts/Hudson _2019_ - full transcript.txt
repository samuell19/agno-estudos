Hey, Hudson. Hudson. It's... Who are you? How do you know my name? Dude, come on, it's me. It's Ryan? I don't know you. -Want me to call the cops? -Seriously? Ah! I got you. Oh my God, your face. -Come here, cousin. -God. It was so funny. It was so fun. I needed that. Thank you. -You all right? -Not really. Come on in. You want me to close this? -Oh, sorry. I got it. -No, it's all right. It's all right. Yeah, I got it. I'll just put it over here. So, uh, how have you been? What have you been up to? Not much, you know. Writing mostly. Get out of here. Writing what? Uh, haikus. -Haiku... -It's this Japanese, uh, form of poetry that's based on syllables. So it's kind of cool because, you know, even though we have entirely different languages, you know, the syllables are global. -Like, we... But all use syllables, so... -That's true. Everyone has, uh, syllables. "It's nighttime again "I can't see "Where is the light? "Dark, dark "and more dark" That's pretty dark. But I liked it. It was good. -That was good. -Oh, thanks. -Sure. -I appreciate it. Well, life is fragile. Take things for granted and... You know, you hear it in movies and books all the time. Life moves so fast, and... It's just all... Just a flat screen until it happens to you. So, hey, I, um, I was on my way up for a film shoot. But I have all this free time. I'm on hold. I really don't know when we're doing these reshoots, so... What do you say I grab a hotel or a bed and breakfast or something, and I'll figure out where I'm... Hotel, shut the fuck up. No, you stay... You stay here for free. I wouldn't wanna... Wouldn't want to be a burden. Oh, I'd love to have some company. -You sure? -Yeah. It'd be great. All right. All right. Let's, uh... We'll be bunkmates. Yeah, although I don't have bunk beds. Ha, gotcha. See, we're smiling already. It's already a good idea. Do you have a bathroom? Yeah, bathroom is back there. Could you put the car on the floor? -Yeah, sure. -Thanks. I've got few more laps to get in. -Yeah. Yeah, I understand. -Thanks. Let me know if you need anything. Hey, it's Beth. Leave me a message, and I'll get back to you. -Taking a tour? -Hey. Yeah, this room's great. It has all your old stuff in it. It's like a museum. I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't... I think it was... Was it not already broken? Yeah, I thought about remodeling, but haven't really got around to it. I mean, what's the point? Do you wanna play croquet? -You good? It's your turn. -Oh, just gonna get my left arm. I hear you sell sandwiches now. What? No. I mean, I was in the sandwich commercial. Yeah. Right. When you're doing the commercial, do you get to eat the sandwich? It's plastic. They make it. They spray... They spray paint it. They put... They, uh... -That's... -...like a little film on the top, to make it look... Just use a real sandwich. Remember we used to lock each other under Grandpa's porch, and you'd have to use the tools under there, to break out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you were, uh... You were really good with those tools. You were like MacGyver. Yeah, I used to be. You remember that time you were, uh, walking to the doctor's with your mom? And then you tripped and fell, and your teeth went through your bottom lip. And you got the stitches, and then you went back to the doctor to check them next day and you fell again. I know you were too busy to make it. What's up with the tent? I don't know. Psst. Ryan. Ryan. -Ryan, wake up. -Hmm. I found this in your wallet. I want to scatter my mom's ashes at the willow tree at Cherry Ridge. Remember the place? I don't have a driver's license, but you do, so you can take us there. It's fate. It's fate that you're here today, -it brought us together. -Hudson. It's not fate when you go through somebody's wallet. It's fate. Okay. Can we talk about it tomorrow? Oh, yeah, yeah, totally. Okay, get some sleep. That thing still run? Yeah. I mean... Uh, I don't know. Oh, I'll check it. Are you... Are you okay? -There's no gas in the car. -Oh. Do you think this is gonna work? Yeah, it is. -Ready? -Oh, I got to get my mom. -Ready? -Yeah. -Here we go. -All right. - Who's that? - It's my neighbor. Oh, my God, this is happening. -Hi, Colleen. -Hudson. How are you? Uh, you know, hanging in there. I heard about your mom. I'm so sorry. Oh, thanks. I appreciate it. I haven't seen you in a while. You've been okay? I've been right here. She was a gem of a woman. I don't... I don't know what I'd do without my mom. - I don't know. - Well, yeah. I don't know how you're gonna do it. - Well... - I don't know. Uh, yeah... Yeah. If you need anything, anything, you just come over, okay? I could make us some TV dinners. I could... I could make a casserole. Oh, yeah. TV dinner? Sounds pretty good. I know you get the good ones. Oh, yeah. You should come over and see the cats. - Oh, yeah. - They would love to see you. You know, they would just love to see you. I think we gotta hit the road now. You always loved Snowball and Mr. Jingles. -Yes, yes. -Nice meeting you. Have a safe trip. Nice meeting you. Wait. Who's this guy? Who's that guy? Thank you, Colleen. I planted a tree for your mom. Oh, that's helpful. Thank you. She's not wearing any pants. Remember, it's got the swing on it? Uh, what's that? The willow tree where we're going, it's got a swing on it. Um. Sort of. We all went to Cherry Ridge when we were kids, remember? It was me, you, my mom, my dad, your mom and Hobbs. My God. Hobbs. We couldn't find him... We had to, like... It was getting dark. We thought he was... We'd have to leave him there. That dog ran away so many times... -Five. Six times. -Whatever happened to him? He died. He got hit by a car. Oh, right. Because he ran away. You know, how many times can you really run away? Right, right, right. "All of the flames burn "My dreams don't have you in them "No, not anymore" It's kinda sad. Hey. Do you want to get ice cream? Uh, it's 7:00 a.m. Do you want to get ice cream at 7:00 a.m.? -I think they open super early. -You think they're open? I know he is. Yeah, we should probably step on it 'cause there will probably be a line. Yeah, I don't think there's gonna be a line. for ice cream at 7:00, but all right. It's really popular. It's gotten even more popular since you were there. Uh, what flavor do you want, Ryan? Uh, chocolate and vanilla. Chocolate and vanilla. Sprinkles? Sure. Great. And what kind of dip? Do you want a... You should get a dip. Oh, that was fast. Here you go, Ryan. Thank you, sir. Cheers. But don't actually touch them because they'll fall apart. Mmm, how's yours? It's, uh... I'm not, I'm not gonna do this. You just dropped your ice cream. -Come on. -What? -Come on. -What? Suburban sprawl. I could never live like this. I don't know how people do it. Everything looks exactly the same. Look at this. Where do you live in New York? Well, I live with my girlfriend in the... In the East Village. It's nice. It's, uh... You know, it's more the area that you want to be in than the size of the apartment. But we have both. I just like that there's always something happening there. You know. You have a girlfriend? Yeah. Oh, what's her name? Beth. What's her middle name? Elizabeth. So your girlfriend's name is Elizabeth Elizabeth? I don't wanna talk about it. I'm gonna run to the bathroom. How's your day, guys? You, uh... It's beautiful up here this time of year. It's an old guy, huh? Four... Is it four-wheel drive? What you got there? IPA? It's good talking to you. Best of luck. See you guys. Safe travels. It's a 240. What? It's a good car. Yeah. I don't... I don't know. Yeah. Good car. Hey, what is that thing? Oh, this is my mom. And my cousin's driving me to the willow tree at Cherry Ridge to scatter her ashes. That's beautiful, man. That's the one with the swing on it, right? - Yeah. - Oh, man. I love that tree. - I used to go there as a kid. - Yeah? Yeah. My grandma lives over there. I'm Sunrise, by the way. I'm Hudson. Nice to meet you. Sunrise. All right, Hudson, what's our next move? What do you mean? No, how do we get to the willow tree? Well, I don't know. So you don't know where we're going? Correct. All right, all right. Well, we'll just get up to that area, and then we'll ask. We'll ask around. Sunrise, she knows where it is. What? No, no. We're not taking that girl with us. She could be a murderer or a drug addict. Oh, no. Oh, you know her so well? We're leaving. What's wrong? - Pop the hood. - Wha... Is that? - The other button. - Sorry, hold on. That's the wipers. - All right. - There you go. Uh, excuse me. We don't we don't have any drugs. Do you know... Do you know what you're doing? Do you know what you're doing? I think it's the fuel pump fuse. - Yeah? - Yeah. Sounds like the fuel pump fuse. Yeah, that's what she just said. All right, go ahead and try and start it up. Purring like a kitty. Good luck on your journey, guys. Thank you What is she doing? I'm not a hitchhiker. Just throwing that out there. Sounds like something a hitchhiker would say. - Here you go. - Thank you. Watch... Hudson. Hudson, I'm driving. All right. Yeah, here it is. So if we take 44-55, that's gonna connect us right to the back roads, and then we'll be, like, right there. That's near, uh, railroad tracks. - Yeah. Yeah. Just use my phone. Eh, no, thanks. I don't like those things. So you're headed up to Cherry Ridge? Yeah, that's where my family is. It's my grandma's birthday. My boyfriend was supposed to take me, but he's being a dick, so... Such a dick. So what are you? Like, a mechanic? Uh, I worked in a shop for a while, but right now I'm just trying to save up all my money because I really want to open an animal rescue and just be surrounded by dogs. What about birds? Yeah, birds, too. Whatever. That's fucking awesome. I just shot a movie with animals, actually. And, uh, the director had these owls just flying back and forth across this room, and one of them just decided, it got distracted or whatever, and it just started to lay into this one actress. And its claws got tangled in her hair, and it started to tear at her scalp. She was bleeding all down her face. So I'm still waiting to... To do reshoots on that. But I'm an actor. Hmm. Is she okay? No. I don't... I don't watch movies, so... Yeah, me neither. Sorry about your mom. Thank you. What are you writing? Oh, just, um, haikus. That's cool. Can I hear one? Um, sure. "The dead flowers sings "Even though no one listens "Sing flower, you're good" Wow. It's beautiful. Seriously. - Thanks. - Yeah. I'm hungry. Are they free? They are trees. Of course they're free. Take as many as you want, bud. Nick. Yes, I'm gonna move it! If I tell you, I'm gonna move it, then what do you think that means, Dad? Relax. How's it going? -I'm good. Thank you. -Great. -I'm just here with my new friends. -Hey. - Uh, this is Hudson. - Hey, Hudson. -Hi. -That's his mom. Uh, that's Ryan. Hi. What's your name again? - Nick. Nick, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. So Hudson's never had cider before. -You got to be kidding me. -Yeah. Well, let's rectify that. Come on. -I think we want to try both. -You got it. Cortland is, uh... It's a darker red apple. Uh, it's got, it's more robust. It's got more rich flavor. Mmm-hmm. More full-bodied, whereas... I think this one's bad. This one... It tasted, like, cloudy or... Cloudy is really more of a look than a taste, but that's okay. If you don't like it, then maybe... Sorry. The Empire, uh, starts tart, and then goes sweet, and then at the back end, it sort of goes back to tart again. - So it's kind of a sweet... - Mmm. Oh, no, that's... Something is definitely wrong. - Yeah, man. I just think. I think that's how cider tastes. No, it tastes... No one else should drink that. You are getting very sleepy. He's been here forever, and he doesn't even look old. I think it's the apples. He probably eats like a hundred a day. Doesn't seem, uh, healthy. Whoa. I used to juggle in gym class as a final. - What? - Yeah. - Gym class? - Juggled for 30 seconds. Oh, that's weird. Yeah, it was weird. The guy wore a fanny pack. Well, this corner... That corner... - That didn't go over so well. - Almost. Yes, I heard you! What's going on? Uh, somebody got lost in the corn maze again. Oh. Does this, uh, happen often? Uh, yeah, several times a day, more than you realize, actually. Hunter! - Hudson. - It's Hudson. - Hudson! - Hudson! Hudson. What's the worst thing that's ever happened in this corn maze? Uh, I'm legally not allowed to tell you that. Bear attack. -No shit. -Yeah, yeah. - Hudson! - Hudson! -Who gets lost in a child's corn maze? -Yeah. What're you doing on the ground, man? You okay? We got him. -All right. Grab his hat. -Who... Who's that guy? Is that the cider guy? -Yeah. -Yeah, that's the cider guy. You're welcome. Section five secure. Can't you just go in? I usually have to wait. Every time? He makes you wait every time to make an appointment? Hudson, hi. - Hi, Maureen. Hi. - Hi. Hudson, I'm really sorry. Oh, thanks. It's okay. Yeah, thank you. Cause your mom, uh... Yeah. Uh, that plant's dead. Yeah, it's dead. I thought I would see you sooner. It's okay. Okay. So... Okay. Um, whenever you're ready. Okay. Are you still getting headaches? Um, it's just shortness of breath, really. How often do you come in here, man? He's a regular, which we like. Anyway, um, Hudson, your blood pressure's pretty high. Uh, but he'll be in, in a minute. See you soon. Bye. What? That's impossible. Panic attacks again? Come on, Hudson. Hey, Uncle Jerry. Got a regular reunion here, huh? Get off my scale. Sorry. Look at me. Follow my finger. Dad, how come you didn't come to Mom's funeral? Hudson, I haven't seen your mom in like 25 years, so... I'm really freaked out to see you two together, I'll tell you that. Why is that? Oh, you don't know that story? Wait, who are you? I'm Sunrise. - Of course you are. - Dope necklace. Oh... Yeah, that was, uh... I got this from a Cheyenne holy woman one really cold night in Wyoming. Oh yeah... Yeah, that's another story. When they were kids, Ryan pushed Hudson out onto a frozen lake. Uncle Jerry, you can't... You can't say that. It wasn't... It wasn't... It wasn't just me. It's not what happened. Are you talking? I can't hear you, man. I got the stethoscope in. So Hudson went through the ice, almost drowned. Another one, Got hypothermia and minor brain damage. One more. Yeah, so that's why every once in a while, you know, he seems a little... Are you... Did you just call me retarded? I didn't say that, Hudson. Yeah, you kinda did. Uh, not exactly. Hudson, I'm sorry. There's nothing wrong with you. Yeah, yeah. Well, I got other patients. Oh, um, I brought Mom's ashes, if you want some, I don't know, maybe you might want some of her ashes. I don't know. It's really thoughtful of you, Hudson. And kinda creepy but, uh, fuck it. Yeah, sure. If you want, I'll take 'em. -Okay. -Yeah. I'll figure out something to do with 'em. I'll get somewhere to put 'em. "When I was a kid "I used to be scared at night "You left the light on" We get along okay. And he left to start this other family. He had new kids. I sort of just saw him less and less and just became this person getting farther and farther away in his rear view mirror. Yeah, and... Now, I'm all grown up, it's like I'm just a stranger to him. He doesn't really know me at all. Sorry. Ugh, you guys like ketchup? No. Makes everything taste like ketchup. Ranch dressing all the way. - Yeah. - Mmm, that sounds good. Mmm-hmm. Mustard? You guys like mustard? Plain or Dijon? - Dijon for sure. - Ryan. What's up, man? - Hey. - Joe. Yeah, I know, Joe. What's up, man. What're you doing here, man? Um, reshoots. - Oh, no shit. - Yeah. - That's cool, man. - How about you? Uh, actually, I'm doing some location stuff for this comic book thing that I just booked. -As an actor? -Yeah, man, of course. What else? - That's huge. - Yeah, bro. It's gonna be... It's next level shit. A lot of money. Shooting overseas... Right now, we're scattering my mom's ashes. - Is that her? - Mmm-hmm. That's Mom? -Pretty much. -Okay. Mind if I grab a strawberry? Never get to eat any of this fatty food. Mmm. That's good. How's Beth, man? - Good. - Good. That's awesome, bro. Good to hear. You know, just between me and you, if that one gets away from you, I'm nabbing her up. Yeah. Anywho. Hey. Yeah, no. I'm coming right now. There I'm is. Nah, just some fans. Hey, I'll talk to you guys later. Yeah. No, I wasn't talking to anybody. Yeah. No way! I'm going to the bathroom. Is that true? I didn't push him. Ugh. Maybe I did. I don't know. We were young, we were stupid. We were just playing a dumb game. Seeing how far we could push each other out onto the lake and... It just happened. I don't know. Hey, remember this place? Not really. Yeah, you do. It's a mini golf course we used to play at. I was really good. I beat Ryan a lot. I didn't always lose. He would get really mad, take his putter and swing it over his head and, like, throw it really far. Yeah, that happened once. Uh, it happened all the time. And once, it, like, went in the parking lot, and it hit a car. My mom would yell at him. Hey, what're you doin'? We have red, yellow, orange, yellow. You might enjoy our Super Deluxe fun package. It has batting cages. We could turn the waterfall on for you, and you can have slushies. No, that's okay. Nobody needs a slushie. Hudson, why don't you just grab a ball, and, uh... All right. We'll see how you feel at the end of this game. These clubs regulation? Uh-huh. - What is he doing? - I don't know. -You sure you want to put the ball there? -Shh. You know the rules. You don't talk when somebody's gonna swing. Sunrise, what did you get on that last one? I think, like, a six. -Where's your club? -Uh... -And I got a two. -I don't know. I don't know. Okay, Bob. It all comes down to this. Off and on, lots of ups and downs. He has had a lot of interesting ball placement throughout the day, -not sure if he wants to put the ball... -Shut up. Ooh, that's gotta hurt. It's about what he's been doing all day. It's fine. It's all right. It's all right. It's just a game. Just a game. So the final tally was Princess Sunflower, 52. -Yes. -Mr. Crybaby, your final score was 39. And Your Majesty got 33. It was a good game. I think I'm gonna put this on my fridge. -Can I see that? -Yeah. That wasn't very nice. Yeah. I have to get my shit together? No, you have to get your shit together. Yeah. Hey, it's Beth. Leave me a message... Ow! Oh, Hudson! I got it. - Yes. Thank you. - Boom. Deserves. So how's it start? Oh, right. So you have your fingers locked like this. Then you bring these fingers up to make the steeple, you put your thumbs in front to make the doors of the church. Hudson, can you keep your eye on the map, please? I don't know where we're going. Oh! Clermont. Remember we went to Clermont County Fair? Ryan, he, um... We went in the thing that spins you around really fast. And so you sit on it, and I told Ryan to, like, spit, and he did, and it went right back in his face. It was funny. Oh. Oh, my gosh. And then we... Where are we going? Hudson. I got another story. One more story. And then we played whack-a-mole, and, uh, I told Ryan... Map, map, map, map, look at the map. Okay, calm down. We're on 44-55. We're just taking this all the way until we hit the backroads, and then we're there. We're on the right path. What was that sound? Was that... That's bad, right? Or... I thought you said this was a great car. Uh, try and start her up. Yeah, she's not going anywhere. Um, if I had my tools I could fix it but... Oh, man, you're never gonna get service out here. So? So what do we do now? I mean, we could walk to town. It's only 5 miles that way. 5 miles? Well, I mean, we could... We could cut through the woods. That would shave it down to a mile. And I have a friend who can fix the car. -Where? Which direction? -A mile that way... This reminds me of Boxcar Children. -What? -Who are they? The books? There're all these kids that live in boxcars in the middle of the forest. And they just survive, and it's so cool. Wait, I'm sorry. It's a children's book about homeless children that live in boxes? - Is this the right way? - Yeah. -How long have we been walking? -Too long. All right, look, I say we go back up to the road and wait for someone to come. Dude, it's just a little bit further this... Just a little further. Actually it's that way. -It's that way. -Right. Yeah. You see this is ridiculous. You have no idea where you're going, and neither do you, okay? Okay, so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna go back up to the road. I'm gonna wait for a human being in civilization. All right, I'm going back to the car. Goodbye. Dude, that's not even the right way. Oh, this is funny to you? It's so funny, everything's so funny and easy going to you. With you drums. Always drumming. All right, it's bullshit. I don't buy it. Hudson doesn't buy it either. Your blue eyes and your charm and all your fucking too-hip-to-be-poor outfit. It's not even my hat. I borrowed all my friend's clothes. Look, I'm going back to New York. I have a life to get back to. Unlike the two of you. Goodbye. Are you okay, Ryan? It's probably been a while since you been the woods, huh, cuz? Probably can't wait to get back to Manhattan. There's nothing to get back to. What're you talking about? - You have an awesome apartment. - Doesn't exist. Just like my girlfriend. And my career, actually. I had nowhere else to go, and I knew you lived up here. I'm a dick. I haven't seen my parents in 10 years. I got in a fight with them and didn't go back. What happened? I kidnapped my grandma. Huh? Well, technically, it was kidnapping, I didn't know it was illegal. I just, uh, I took her from her nursing home back to her house. You know, my parents put her in there, and I didn't think she belonged there. It was a big huge waste of time. They ended up bringing her right back to the nursing home, so... Sunrise, you're a criminal. I guess it's my turn. I, uh... I wish I'd, uh, done something to make my mom proud before she died. You know, instead of just living under her roof and eating her food, and, occasionally, taking out her garbage. Now, there's nobody... Nobody really left to... To care. Hey. Let's go. Everyone up. Come on. We can do this. Come on. Hudson, come on. Hudson. Hey! Who's that guy? I don't know, but looks like she really likes him. What? How do you know? You don't know that. It's kind of a long hug. Hey. - Al saved the day. He's the best. So he's gonna go tow the car back here. He's gonna fix it. It should take, like, an hour, an hour-and-a-half. Yeah, who... What, is Al your friend or an old boyfriend or... - What? - Is anyone else hungry? Yeah, I am. Are you? -Yeah. -Yeah. I can go get us something. -Yeah, I'll come with you. -Nah, I'll be okay. Um, I'm just gonna go over there to Rong Chengs. Chinese. Sounds good. I'm gonna go ask Al if he's got a first aid kit. -All right. -Yeah. You know, you really just got to chill out. Yeah? Just thought I'd be further along than I am. Nothing has turned out the way that I'd planned it. What did you plan? What was your grand plan? Everything was very simple before. I think you're just taking everything way too seriously. You're looking at everything wrong. This should be an exciting time. Like, no one's telling you what to do. You don't have to worry about anyone else. No boss, no girlfriend. No place to live. Those all sound like terrible things. Well, you can do whatever you want. That's awesome. You know, people wish they could do that. I don't know. I think you're too much... You're just in your head. That's all. -Sorry. -Did you listen to anything that I just said? -Come on. -Yeah. Peace offering? Got it. I hope you like food. "Make serious decisions in the last few days of the month." What's the date? "Listen to yourself more often." That's good. "Keep your feet on the ground and your thoughts at lofty heights." I don't know what that means. You doin' okay? Yeah, I don't think you need those, Hudson. Have you seriously never driven? Uh-oh. Here comes the blue car. Am I going too fast? - Whoo. - Uh, no. All right, give me the keys. Go ahead and just take this road all the way down, you'll hit that barn I was telling you about. That red barn. Just park there. They don't care. Take the railroad tracks, follow those for a while, and then it will just hit this clearing. The tree is right there. You can't miss it. Thanks. You're going to be fine. Bye, I think. Oh, she left the window down. I'll get that up. Looks a little different now. Hudson, where you goin'? Hey. Hudson! Hold up! Stop running! So just tell me this. Does this hurt? Relax, relax. Does this hurt? No? Okay. Good, good. This? Okay, okay. What you do? Throw him off a cliff? He tripped. I ran and tripped and fell and landed on my... - My arm. - Put your hand on there. It's not broken. I'm 99% sure that. You got a sprain here, maybe some bruising. Fucking Velcro. Okay. Here we go. You're gonna have to get this looked at again in about a week. Okay. I'll make an appointment. -Here? -Yeah, definitely here. If that's okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's cool. Let's get this on the correct side. Okay. Good. Good. Try not to run away from stuff that isn't there, okay? Maybe, uh, I don't know, maybe you want to fall by the house sometime, have a beer. Um, sure. - Maybe, uh... - A little, uh... Yeah, that'd be great. I have some really good shit. And, you know what? It'll help mellow you out. Just... Yeah. - Yeah, I see that. - Do that with me. - You felt that. - I felt that. I can see that in your eyes. - Yeah. All right. Here, let me help you. I'll go around. - Can you do the thing? - Yeah, yeah. - Thanks. - You good? Are you okay? Hudson. Yeah? I, uh... I never meant, um... Oh, it's okay, man. I get it. - Yeah? I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm sorry. -You all right? -Yeah. -Here is your hat. -It's more of the... Thanks. -Yeah. -Thank you. Sure. You hungry? Oh, yeah. You think I can stay here for a few days? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Stay as long as you like. -It'd be great. -All right.
