Let me out! Vitka! Stop! Look out! Out of the way! Get away from the horse! Get the kid away! Get the kid away, I've said! Calm down, Sanko! Calm down! If only they were so kind to you as you are to them, grandpa! Burtya, take away your damn daredevils! Nina, we respect your family, have some respect for mine. We'll not hurt the child, especially yours. There you go! Grandpa, the foal is hurt, what shall I do? Well, take it to its mother on the field, let them eat, you'll catch us up later. - Larysa! - Girls! Girls! I'm in here! - Get in, get in, I tell you! - Why me? - C'mon help me! - Help yourself!

You'll get along alone. Open up! - What was that? - Nothing. There-there, get out... Slowly... What are you looking at, you wee wanker, get off! - Get off!! - Are you crazy? Shut up, he's just a kid! Come here, come to me. What are you doing here? Let's go, let's go, we'll take you to your granny. It's 40 days since your father died, you'll help your mom with commemoration? - What are you doing? - What? There's this crump following us! - Nastya, are you fucking dumb, he's a kid! - As if anyone cares. Calm down! Let us send the kid home, and go to see the boys. All fine. Vadyk! Vadyk, go home! C'mon, go home, Vadyk! OK, let's go, let's go faster. Why did you come here? Go away, get away from the horse! What are you doing here? Why are you lurking here? Go away, go away I tell you! Go away! Away! Go! Go! And what will you tell to your grandma? To your mom? I'll tell nothing, I'll just leave with you. You'll be a burden. Don't dare to tell me that! - Scar, let us leave this place! - I've told you we are going to leave when I'm back... Don't push it on me! Hush-hush, no one is nagging you... Let us leave for a place without your work, without my grandmother, just you and me. Let us go to the sea, let's go there! Let us go there, please, let's go there! Scar... Let's go there... Do you hear me? We will fuck there... You and me, you hear that? - And then? - And then... We'll find a cave there.... And I'll be walking naked, and lying on the stones... ... laughing... - And? - And... ... and you will come and have me whenever you want, you hear me... ... I'll blow you, there will be just you and me, on the beach... ... we'll eat figs, just you and me, you hear me... ... just you and me... - And? - And... And... And... Hello there, horsey. Stay with me, horsey! Shameless you are! We've almost died here with Irka looking for you! You'll go to your mother first thing in the morning! Vitka will stay with me. And you'll go to Tamara, help her out with the commemoration and the neighbours will not call my grand daughter a slut! And you go to bed! I've told you to go to bed, go to sleep! Leave the horse and go to sleep! Just you look at that! She's even turned her cousin against me! It's good that your late father does not see you now! You go to bed! Go to bed right now! His eyes would have been burned out out of shame! Just look at that, what a sissy, what a nervous sissy! You should take care of your nerves, you should be calmer! You should be nice to people or you'll get nothing! Larysa, stop! - Larysa, wait, you'll go to your mom tomorrow! Larysa, don't leave me! Don't leave me! Come back, you fool! - Larysa, don't leave me! Don't leave me! Vigro, brother! Sanko stop! - Sanko! - Let me go! Let me go! Grandfather! Why?! Thank you, thank you. Wow, calm down, you ninjas. Hi there. Take me with you, please. I won't bother you, I swear. Please, I beg you, take me with you. Please, I won't be a burden, really. Take me with you, please! Oh wow, what do we have here! Calm down, man! What's up? - Is that your doll? - Mine, do you care? - Nope, she's just pretty. - I know, I like her too. And what is that? Served in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan? Where exactly? What does Vadym want? OK, what I've got is that our client has screwed everything up on gambling, the house, the money, everything. And Vadym wants his money back. What we need to do is to tickle him up a bit, press him a bit, no wet-work Vadym will kill us for that, he's already said that before. No wet-work, that's clear. - I don't feel well. - Why the fuck are you drinking if you don't feel well? - Why are you shouting at me? - Let's go! - Wait, wait! - Let's go, let's take a breath. Feel better? - A bit. - Thank God. - You're mad as if you're not happy to see me. - Cause I'm not! Why the fuck did you go with us? As if I have nothing else to do but watching your ass. And what was I supposed to do? Go back to grandma's after all that happened? - Yes, to grandma's. We had a deal! - What a fucking deal did we have, tell me? - Couldn't you have waited for couple more days? - No, I couldn't wait any longer, you get that? - What's going on, girls? - Fuck off, man. What's wrong, dude? Any problems, dude? Come over here. Let her go, you motherfucker! Vitiuylya stop! Let it go! The train, guys, the train! C'mon, we have to catch the train! Move! - Wait, wait! - What? - I'll catch up! You're not coming! You're not coming! - No! - No, no, please, no... - Here's the money, go to your mother. Go to your mother! I'll be back and we'll go to the sea, and now - go to mom. - That's it. - What? - I'll be back! - Scar! Scar! Scar! Scar! Motherfucker! - This train goes to Lozova? - Yes! I'm begging you, let me in. Come up! Just look at yourself! I cannot even look my neighbours in the eyes! Those neighbours are bitches anyway. It is so hard without Kolya... 40 days since he died soon... ... and he is still here... He is here still. I wake up at night, and he's here, walking around the flat... Angry... And you haven't been to cemetery to see him, even once... You only think of having fun. Mom, don't speak of dad... You'll go to the accounting office with me tomorrow. Mom, please, no, I beg, don't do that, please, mommy... Don't you "mommy" me, don't... You've already got what you wanted, everyone thinks my daughter is a slut! Everyone, who? Those everyone, where are they? Show me, I want to see them! - All the people! - What people?! Who are they? Where are they? There? Here? Are you here? Turn your TV on and let us leave our life! Can you hear me? Are they there, mom? Or maybe they are there, ha? Or there even? Can you hear me? Leave us alone! And fuck off! Or are they somewhere else, mom? Are they in here? Leave us alone, you get it, fuckers?! Leave us alone! What?! What?! Don't touch me! No! You bitch! What are you doing! What are you doing! Mom, no, stop it, mom, no! Good morning! And who do we have here, little and bare feet? Granny is a fool! You can't say that about your granny, the God will punish you! - No He won't! - Yes, He will! - No, He won't! Yes He will! And you'll get pimples all over your face! - No, it won't! - Yes, He will punish you and you'll get pimples! One more word and someone will be slapped on the ass, guess who? - The God will... - You, wicked child, you'll get what you deserve! Stay there! Where are you going! Stay there, you damn child! I will get you! Oh my God, where are you running to! Stop! Help me good people! Help me good people! Are you crazy? Kostya, what the fuck? Motherfucker! Wake up! Wake up! Calm down, you asshole! - Didn't you like it? - No, I didn't! Punish him! Punish him hard! Are you leaving me or what? You're leaving? Calm him down! What is this? Hemp pancakes? Don't panic, a friend of mine brought it. Hey, body, are you up for a breakfast? And what's on the menu? Pancakes, sir. Everyone freeze! Hey, girls, wait a minute! Tamara, and what do we have here? - Do we have a newcomer? - Hello, Vira! We've missed the college because of Kolya's death, and I thought she might work here a bit... Of course, let her work, she's a smart girl, even my son Roman likes her. Let her work, have some experience. Let it be, let her work. - Hi there, pretty doll. - I have a name, it's Larysa. Hey, don't you get the jokes? Larysa, darling, wait a minute. Listen to me, I don't bloody need a daughter-in-law like you, but my son likes you, so use it while it lasts. Do you get that, my dear? Have a nice day. Tamara, wait for me, let's go to work together. Stop biting your nails! - Give me the report! - I will! Larysa, take this, dear. it's a small task. Label it all with numbers. - Have you left your granny alone? - Why alone? Vitka is there with her. Her grand-daughter from Kyiv. Of course, it's summer break, left the children on granny's guard she must be very happy. Why should she be happy? They make kids and then no one cares of them. For God's sake, shut up! Think of Masha, she has a bunch of kids they bring them up with the whole village and nothing's wrong, the kids are fine. But that is the case when really all of the kids are common! Larysa! Why are you so sad? I've given you a task to do! - I've lost the count! - Sorry, it's not a computer. Ladies, you're not ladies, you laugh like horses! Are you smoking? You'll have green kids then! Yours will be of the same green too. I'm a man, it's not a man's concern, he came in, came out and left. Well, yeah. I don't want children, I don't like children. Don't say that. You'll get married and will get pregnant straight away. In this shit?.. What kids, I don't even want to live in this shit... Well, look, I have a house, an outhouse to my mother's house. I'll buy some piglets in autumn, and then move into my house. You really plan to live here? And why not? And I will leave. Where are going? - To dad's grave. - I'll join you. - No, I want to do it alone. Tamara! Don't worry, she'll get over it! Let's go and have some tea. Come on! I hear Kolya walking around the flat. i wake up at night, and hear his footsteps, angry. My God! Oh boy! Call the ambulance! Call the ambulance! Why are you looking, call for doctor! Are you completely mad? Sons of the devil! Guards! Happy? OK, and now what? Gonna have to buy something. There, buy a titbag for Larysa, what size? I've wanted to give her this, the ring. - Wow, looks nice. - It's my mother's. - Cool. - A family treasure. - A real one? - Yeap. - You think she will forgive? - I would! - What? I like it! - Something is missing... - There! - Try it on! - Fits well! - A true beauty! And my friends are still waiting. Well here I am, still here. Let's go to the cashier. - Sweety, what are you doing here? - I'm throwing the stones. And where is your mom? Where's mom? - Mom is there! - There? Let's go and find her. You're so dirty. Come to me. Masha! Come with me. Don't be afraid, hush! Masha! Masha! - Let's go! - She's here? Masha? The door is closed. Masha? Hush-hush. Take care of your brother, girls? Go there, take care of your brother, go ahead. Granny will now pour the water, and when it gets out, you'll hit it with your shovel. - Okay. - Are you ready? - Yes. Is it getting out? Get ready with your shovel! Horsey... Daddy... Who's there? Baby, how long shall I wait? I'm in the right place, you've ordered a boy? What kind of a fucking boy? A blue-eyed dark haired, 190sm tall. Wrong address, moron. What do you mean wrong address? Fuck! What the fuck didn't you get? Crawl the fuck off till I pushed you down the stairs. If you don't like to be on top, you can do bottom, no shame! Asshole! Motherfuckers! Creeps! Faggots! Shut his fucking mouth! You've broke my knee, you fucking assholes! Where is the money? Where is the cash? - Who the fuck are you, monkeys? - Monkeys? He called us monkeys, Kostya. Ah, you like it this way! - Faggots! - Faggots, you say? Give it or we'll find it anyway. Give back Vadym's debt! Fuck my life! I've set it all out with Vadym, long ago! Darling, I'm Vadym's man, you have set a shit out with him! - Where's the debt? - Call Vadym, we'll see. I'll roll you up in concrete, fuckers. Oh look, you have a car! But your leg is now in pain, you won't drive it, I'll have it. - Shut the fuck up, whore! - I'm not a whore! You want your second knee shot too, ha? You are telling me where the money is and we are leaving? Got it? - It's all empty here! C'mon, where's the money? - In your ass! In the ass! Let us make it fast, where's the money? Go fuck yourself! I've found it! What the fuck? Who's also here? How many people? Speak! You've had your share, fuck off. Don't hurt my father! Stop it, Vitya, stop! Stop it, calm down! Get the fuck out! Vadym? It's Anton! Kesha's killed. And Sasha, his son, they've killed him too. I've brought him the money, three wankers came in, said they work for you. Are they your men? Why?... Why did they have to kill? Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin! For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. How long will you wait for your bandit? Maybe something happened with him? And you want to waste your life waiting for him to be killed? Mom, he promised me he'll come... He promised me, really... Mommy... Marry Roman... - And so... we didn't make it without the wet-work... - Yes, we didn't make it! Yes, we didn't make it! Cause we didn't make it! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Not a word! We get Larysa and go to Poland! Then everyone on his own, and we don't tell each other where we go, got it? And why we can't tell each other where we go? - You don't get it, fucker, don't get it! - Yes, I don't get it! Vadym will catch you, brake your fucking fingers and you will tell where we are! And otherwise, you will be busted and your conscience will be clear! And why would I need my conscience if I'll be dead. I want to live... You want to live... That kid wanted to live too. - Faggot. - Faggot? - Yes, I'm a faggot! Super Fucker! - Shut up! Shut up, there're cops there! - Well... - Fuck my life! They've lost their shame! C'mon, faster! Guys, we'll handle these on our own, deal? Guys, we have a company, check the mirrors! Fuck! Bitch! - Fuck! Fuck! - What? What?! - Do we have a plan? What's the plan? - I don't know! I don't know!!! We'll make it, faster, go faster! Goose it up! - Faster! Faster! - Just shut your mouth! Shut up! C'mon! Drive! Faster!!! - Whata fuck is going on... - Go faster, fuck!

Thank you! And this is for her... Vitka, give it to her. Tell her I'll be back when everything settles. I will be back, you hear me? Tell her, I will come back for her. Oh you Gypsy scumbags, stealing my apples! Get down there or I'll let the dog on you! The ring, where's the ring? Granny! What a rascals! Bastards! - Sit down, Yukhum, sit down! - And what did I tell you! And you keep on saying, kids, kids! The Gypsy scumbags! You see, stealing in the daylight! One has to kill them all! Well, not killing, perhaps... Look what has happened to Burtya's grandson.. May he rest in peace. Well... And how's your youngest doing? Oh, I'll call her for breakfast! My God! What a day it is! I was saving it for the burial day! My Dearest God! Have I deserved this punishment? Stop there, you wicked child! Stay there! - Vadyk, let's run together! - Stay still, you wicked child! Stay there! Stop! Vitka, stop! Vadyk, stop! Stop right there, you wicked children! Wait till I get you! Oh you, nasty dog, I will get you... And you... what are you doing here? Go away! You Gypsy scumbags! I will, I will... What are you...? Give it back! Give it back to me! Where are you dragging me? Granny, we are on fire! Granny, we are on fire! Vitka, go back to bed! Granny! We are burning! We are on fire! - What do you mean... - On fire! Get up! Where is the fire, you, wicked child! There! Fire! Yukhum's house is on fire! Yukhum! Yukhum! You will sit there, you'll all fit! Take that, pour some into glasses. Pour some for Tamara. We will commemorate Kolya with everything the God has sent us. Tolya, go ahead, say something! Say a word! Let us honor Kolya, go ahead! Life... No one knows when it starts, We don't know when and why it ends. No one knows where do we come from, and where do we go to. One church tells you one thing, and the other - completely different. They've told us for seventy years that the God does not exist. And now they say, He exists. And I think He exists. And He will meet us there, when we die. And He will ask us, if we lived well here. I don't know what did you tell him, Kolya. But you've gone a long way here. And now, Kolya, you are there with God, and we are still here. We are about to meet Him, but no one knows when or how. Pray for us there, and we will pray for you here. Rest in peace, my friend. Without saluting! Let us drink! - Roman, what had happened? - Vitka, where are you going? Ostapivna, stay, stay with us, they will figure it out themselves. What is wrong, Vitka, my sunshine, what has happened? I want to tell you something. I don't like your Roman! Well, what can I do... Scar gave me a ring and I've lost it... Vitka, stop making things up! But he really gave me the ring! Honestly, honestly! Stop making it up! Lets' go! - But he did! - Stop lying, go to grandma! You are mean! What had happened there with the two of you? Let's leave tomorrow? Where to... Why would we go anywhere, I've bought the piglets already... Let's go to the sea tomorrow... And what will we do there? We will sleep on the beach... We will eat figs... You will have me whenever you want... And why won't you just marry me, we'll live like all normal people? Granny, and why did the little one die? It just happened... Died. The God has taken her. Ask God not to take me and not to kill me... And not to touch me... So that I could live forever and never die. And so I wasn't sad or hurt... And so I would never cry... And so that no one ever cried. And so that all of the people were happy and joyful. And I will be there sitting in the corner. And enjoy every day. And I will laugh a lot and I will do a lot of good things! And tell Him I want a doggy, a kitten, and a younger sister. And I want to eat a lot of candies for breakfast. And I want to disobey my granny, and her not to scold me... I want everyone not to argue... I want everyone to be happy and joyful. Newly weds, enjoy the webs! Our children are here already! - They are so fine! My children! May God bless you with happiness and health. May you always be among the high wheats and bright flowers. May happiness and love be with you! May your children be nice! May love be with you! God bless! Congratulations, my darling. Come with me, I'll show you my present. Look, he's got her on the horse, they will steal her, trust me! They will take her away! The white horse is like the moon. clean and beautiful. Let it take her far away from the sadness and pain. And may their family never know miseries or hardships. Hope everything will be fine! Roman, take her down! Hold the horse! Never let her go! Dear guests, we invite you to our house! My dear guest, you are all welcome! Welcome, welcome! Come into our house, dear guests! What's up, Vitka, let's go! What's wrong, what has happened? Scar was here... and told me... to give his ring to Larysa... ... and I've lost it... Honey, there's nothing wrong in that, it happens, let's go. No! But he really gave me a ring! - It's not your fault! Everything's fine! - No, it's my fault! It's my fault! Listen to me, Scar will; be back, I like him more than this one too. Quiet, quiet! Katya, what do you have there? Pour the glasses full! Life... is a journey full of hope. you always hope that it will start at the next turn! But, not everyone is that lucky! I want to wish you, children, to have patience, patience, and patience once again. What does he say! Bollocks! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
