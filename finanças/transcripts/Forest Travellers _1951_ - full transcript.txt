Time to get up! Just a minute. Let's hurry up and wash. I'm washed. Your neck too? Now brush your hair ... And now, children, We will learn to jump from branch to branch. Attention! Ready... go! As you can see, it is not that difficult. On "ready", you bend over into a ball, on "go", you push off with your hind legs and jump. Let's do it. Ready... go! Now go up. Ready... go! Good! Now go down. Ready... go! What's up? Can I do this exercise not all at once, but gradually? What do you mean, gradually? "Ready..." I will do today, and "go" - tomorrow. You see, I'm very scared. There is nothing to be scared of! It's embarrassing to be cowardly, Sandy! Jump! Ready... go! I fell. Well, kids, you've done some jumping, now find something to do without me. I'll go find us something for breakfast. Let's jump into the next the tree, eh? What are you saying?! There's no way you'll jump that far! Yes, I will! Ready... Oh. Ready... go! Well done! Made it!! Where did you come from? Ah! I'm not from here. I am a jay bird. I came from another forest. There other forests besides ours? Ah! Of course there are! Over there, downriver, beyond the field. It's so beautiful and large! And there is a lot of food there - mushrooms, and pine cones and berries! - How interesting! - Well, I must go. Wait a minute, foreign jay! What's up? Tell me something else, please! I have no time to stay here, my dear. Why stay? I'll accompany you to that fir tree, and you can tell me on the way. Where was I? - The mushrooms. - Ah! So many mushrooms in that forest, you'll never count them all! Empty again! Oh! Oh... you could kill someone like that! Oh, it's you, neighbour! Believe me, I didn't do it on purpose! I'm so upset! Now I've got to bump along home without a single pine-cone. Yeah? Hmm... I've got a pine-cone bump myself now, by your grace. Only, unfortunately, it's not edible. Oh, Grandpa, you're joking, but I'm in no mood for jokes! My children have not even had breakfast today. Maybe I should go look for mushrooms or something? Don't even try it, neighbour! I've been all around the area, and didn't see a single mushroom. - You didn't see any? - Not one. In that case, this is my mushroom! Oh, I can't believe I missed that! Now I'm left without a dinner. Don't be upset, neighbour. You're welcome to bite off any bit! Thank you. - Shh! - What? - Hear that? - I hear nothing. Me neither. Even the birds are silent. What could it mean, hmm? What's the matter, mice? What? What's going on? - Marten. - Marten?! I need to run to the children! Oh! Where's the marten? I d.. do not know, but i... it seems like she's everywhere! Are my kids all right? Mum, you've been away for a long time! Shh! We cannot talk loudly! Where is Whitenose? - He jumped over to the next tree! - Yes, and then dropped out of sight. Out of sight! Mum! Ahoy! If the marten hears him, he's dead! - It's Whitenose! Why do you not answer him? - Yeah. If I shout out to him, it will bring the marten to our nest! Mum! Ahoy! What should I do? Oh, Mum! Someone is chasing me! Mum! Mum! Here, here! Hurry to the nest, quick! Where did he go? Mum! Ahoy! Ah, there you are! Mum! - Mum! - Mum! Listen up, children. Although it is difficult for me with a wounded foot, and it's far... we need to move to another forest. - There's not much food left here. - Where to? We'll walk through the old places we knew, upriver. But a foreign jay told me that we need to go not upriver, but downriver. A jay may say all sorts of things. Maybe there isn't even a forest there. What if someone runs off and finds out? What do you mean, "someone"? You mean yourself? Well, you can't, right? - Not now, I can't. - There you are, so I'll go! They say there are pinecones and mushrooms there beyond count! You're still little! Little, but quick as anything! I doubt any harm will come to him! It's very far. I can't even give him any food for the road. I'll eat when I get to that forest! Oh, what am I to do with you? Hooray! You agreed! And one and two! And one and two! And one and tw... Here is the mushroom you left behind yesterday, neighbour. - Is that really the same one? - The same one...! I went out this morning to get it. - Eat it and get well soon! - Thank you. - Uh-huh. - Grouse! - Yes? Do you have a minute? I have a big request to ask of you. Please, catch up with Whitenose and give him this mushroom. Only, well... do it on the sly. If he finds out that it's from us, he'll never take it, he'll say, "they themselves have nothing to eat." Got it. Well, now I can have breakfast! How did you get here, Whitenose? I-I'm travelling. Where are you going? Home, to my black grouse. So you will see my mum! Give my regards to her, please, and then... could you... Ha, ha, ha, ha! What a clever trick you thought up! You've got a good head, there! Ha-ha-ha! You should have seen how delighted he was... When he found the mushroom, he even did a little dance just like this! And I was hiding behind a bush and almost couldn't hold my laughter! Your son sends his regards and asked me to bring you this mushroom. He found it on the glade. Yeah... Hello. Do you know how to get to the forest where there are a lot of cones and acorns? mff mff mff I'm sorry, I did not quite understand. Could please repeat that? MFF MFF MFF What did you say? I can't understand. I said, "I have no time to talk to you!" - Got it now? - G-g-got it now. Thank you very much. So anyway, do you know the way to the forest? I'm a hamster. I live in the field. I-I-I know nothing about any forest! A-a-and do not bother me any more! You see, I'm busy! I'm gathering supplies... for the winter! Would you please give me a few grains? I haven't had anything to eat since yesterday. - No. - No? You haven't picked all your grains up. There are a few left over here. mff mff mff - What? MFF MFF - What? MFF! MFF! MFF!! - What are you talking about? I said "thank you" three times already! What else do you want from me?! Just get out of here before I forget myself! There's the forest! Hey! You on that log! Keep hold of that log, or it will break our dam! How can I keep hold of it, when I can hardly keep on top of it?! Ay-ay-ay-ay! Oh-oh-oh-oh! Help me! Follow me! Mum! Oh-oh-oh! Oh! Ma-ma! Don't you worry, neighbour! If he is not eaten by a hawk or a marten, he'll surely come back! Yeah... There's surely no way he could drown, for example! - Where am I? - Amongst friends! Goodbye! Thank you, beavers! Good luck with finding a new home! Hey there, buddy! Well, what do you think of our forest? Do you like it? Hello, Jay! I love it! Ah! Ah! Well then, come live here. Look - here is a home, ready for you to move in! When you get settled, come and visit me. Okay, now I need to get home quickly! Enough, enough, enough. That's all, that's all, that's all. Coming, coming. Thank you, thank you! Okay, let's go! Very kind of you. Where are you going? To get mum! You'd better wait a little - look at that dark cloud coming in! The cloud moves slow, but I run fast, so it won't catch up to me! We'll have to get back before evening, from the looks of it! Go, go, go! I'll wait here a little bit longer. Maybe he'll come back after all? We'll also wait with you a bit longer! Dear neighbour, well... Listen to me carefully. Uh... Mum, it's me! It seemed to me that I heard someone calling me. You imagined it. Don't be sad! Who could be blamed if Whitenose has died? I, I can be blamed. I should not have let him go. He was so handsome and funny. He used to sneak up behind me, put his paws over my eyes, and not make a sound. I'd know it was him, but would deliberately say: "Ginger!" And he would burst out laughing: "Got it wrong! Got it wrong! It's not Ginger, but me... Whitenose." Stop it, Ginger. I'm in no mood for jokes. Got it wrong! Got it wrong! It's not Ginger, but me - Whitenose! Yes, hrm, very... very touching! Mum, hurry up! Come on! It's a really great forest there! Really great! Happy housewarming, neighbour! Thank you. And where is the rest of the family? Gin-ger! Mum, I'm here! I fell again! And where is Whitenose? Sleeping. Dreaming of something. Quiet, you! Whitenose is sleeping. THE END Subs by Eus, ed. by Niffiwan after Russian subs by Elena
