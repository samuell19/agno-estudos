Well, it's about time someone opened something around here. Cooper, don't you even think about it. - Come on, stop it! - Hey. Let him up, now. I'm just playing. How about I come in there and do that to you, huh? Treat him nice. Hey, Rock! Stop messing with kids over there. Help me figure out this burp in this tranny. - Hey, baby. - Hey there, Dawn. Oh, that looks so good. What's going on? Eat this pie before it gets cold. You getting to be quite the man, ain't you? I just want to get the shop open, you know. Here. You hear that? What? The sound of nothing. Just you, me and the crickets. Yes, sir. Now, you sure there ain't nothing I can do to persuade you gentlemen not to take my stereo? Ma'am. Yeah... Yeah, I'm real sorry about skipping the payments, boys. Ever since I hurt my back, I can't work. I can't work, can't make money. It's all right. We understand. Sorry to have to do this to you. Uh, y'all sure you don't want a little something to drink before you leave? - Little something might be nice. - All right, take it. Clint. What the heck's going on here? Huh? You and your buddies hanging out in my house? Can't a man visit his boy when he wants to? You know Franklin ain't home this time of day. What, your mama ran out of whiskey? Huh? I don't know what he done told you, but he don't live here no more. So y'all better get to steppin'. We're from the Plantation repo. Oh, for the love of sweet Jesus, Dale. Franklin's gonna be devastated when he can't watch the race on Sunday. Are you just gonna fucking sit there? Huh? Are you just gonna fucking sit there and let them take all my stuff? Well, I-I mean, it's not really your stuff, now, is it? I mean, y'all didn't even need to break the door down or nothing, did you? He just let you in, just gave you a drink. Oh, you just lay down. You lay down, Dale. - Yeah, why don't you just shut it? - Lay down like you always do. Just shut it! Just shut it 'fore I make you shut it! Oh, big man's got his whiskey talking, huh, Dale?

Sorry to spoil your fun, but, uh, this piece of shit's done paid for. Want me to give her a try? When it comes to stubborn engines, got a good touch. Keep doing that, you're gonna flood her. Fine. Yeah. Go on. Well... Thank you. Hey, I'm sorry. It just feels like everything's being stripped away. Just pulled away, you know? And sometimes I... think how much we got to lose before we got nothing left. Maybe I can see if there's something I can do for y'all. Boy's into NASCAR, huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah, he lives for it. You just do what you got to do with the TV, all right? Don't mess yourself up on my account. I won't mess myself up. Why you being so nice to me? Let's just say you seem like a decent person. You know? And I don't lay down. Better get on now. Well, thank you. Hey, Clint, come on! Let's go. Looks like you're a little light here. Well, there's this person. I was just hoping maybe we could cut her a break just now. Maybe talk to Stewart or something. "Her"? So, uh... this is a woman, huh? It ain't nothing like that. Well, sure sounds like something like that. Well, you never ask for too much, so, yeah, I'll talk to Stewart and get him to cut this person a break.

Do you think it's funny? Do you? Tom's like a father to me. He looks after me. These people are like my family. And they're Klan, right? My granddaddy was Klan. All right. So you know, then.

Thank you... - Be careful. - ...for lending your body, not just in the protest of the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan... - ...and all the ugliness and hatred that it represents... - Yes. ...with their history of murder, of rape... - Yeah! - ...of inciting terror in the hearts of people of color, but towards the march of equality... ...towards peace, towards unity for all men and women in this great country. That's right. - There we go. - Amen. The niggers are coming. They're coming up the street. All right. Here we go. Uh, Clint, you and the boys wait here. Mike, come with me. You're up on the roof. Remember, a man has a right to protect himself. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, boys. My brothers. My sons. Calm down. Remember why we're here. Stay calm. How long are we gonna let this go on? Either you protest peacefully or you go on home. Why don't you go on and tell Grant about peace. Son, what are you thinking about? What are you doing? Hold on. Y'all want to go see the museum, it's gonna cost you ten bucks. Might want to stop by the bank, though, 'cause we don't take food stamps. See, that's just... - Hold on. Hold on. - Right there, man. Let's not do anything before things get out of hand, now. Before things get out of hand, go. Y'all heard Reverend. Go. Hey, Kennedy. You come to check out the merchandise? We got some new stuff for you. You can get your picture taken in full Klan regalia for 15 bucks. Only for you, it's free of charge. Don't you want to know what it feels like to have the real power? He ain't got no power. Come on! Give it a shot. I bet your uncle would've preferred to be under this hood than under a train trestle. - Come on! - Back up! Yo! - Everybody, let's file out. Let's go on home. - Y'all heard Reverend. - File on out, everybody. Just go home. - Let's go. Let's go. File out. Janice, get 'em on out of here. ♪ Kumba, kumba, Kumba vista... ♪ Don't you be eyeballing me, you fucking nigger. What'd you call me? - Kelvin! - Come on, fucking nigger! Let's go. Let's go. Baby! Listen, Tom, we're gonna take him down. We ain't gonna process him, all right? So he'll be back in an hour and a half. Okay. Thanks. Well, at least someone had the balls to try something. Just can't believe it was Clint and not you. I think your mama'll understand when I tell her we're having faggot for dinner. I know you. - Let me up! - Fuck you think you're doing? You forget good, old-fashioned Southern hospitality? Better late than never, son. You're out of order, Klansman. Fine with me. I ain't no Klansman no more. Now, you just settle down, boy. Don't go writing no check your ass can't cash. Michael, honey, maybe you should just sleep this off. There ain't nothing to sleep off. You want to leave? That's fine. Don't mean a thing to me. Go. God help you, son. When was the last time you saw God anywhere around these parts? I told you, Tom. That Judy must've had some nigger in her. Anybody else got anything to say? Huh? Any y'all? Yeah, that's what I thought. Hey, you stay here. I'm out. What's up, little man? Go ahead. Want to put this cable back on? If I can reach. I ca... Yeah, I can't reach. Never pull down. That's the first lesson of mechanics. How about up and down? Yup. And the back. Y'all got to vacate the premises by order of the sheriff's department. - What are you talking about? - Failure to pay rent. That ain't right. We're all paid up. It's the middle of the night right now. We got a kid in here. You can take it up with the judge in the morning. Meantime, you got 30 minutes to gather your belongings. You got anything in the kitchen you need? Up we go. Lion! We forgot Lion! I'll go get it. You're out of time. - It's the kid's stuffed toy. - Not my problem. It's a fucking stuffed toy. No, I think it's okay to go get the kid's toy, but, uh... we're gonna take the keys to the truck. Feel like you got them all? Why don't you rinse that out. Hold it a little while. That's good. Now we got to check them. You know how you check them? Check them like wolves. Do you happen to have any, uh, jobs available here? Appreciate you. Do you happen to have any jobs available here? Thank you. Yo, little man. Thank you. Welcome to Chicken Run. Oh, yeah. Thank you so much. Hey. I got fired! Klan's reach runs far. It's gonna be weeks before I see anything from unemployment. I don't even have an address to send a check to. Maybe we should leave town. Well, better the devil you know than the devil you don't, huh? Should've told me that before you made me leave the Klan. Well, I didn't. Now we got to go to the grocery 'cause, uh, all the food I got from the house is all gone. I put gas in the tank today. Are you saying there's nothing left? Maybe a little something for Franklin tonight. What about tomorrow? All right. You say "miss" if she's not married. - You say "ma'am" if she looks old and respectable. - Drop it. Hey, you got any change? - Spare any change, ma'am? - No. Spare any change? Got any change? Hey, you spare some change? Hey, spare some change? Hey. Spare some change? Has the child and woman eaten yet today? Why don't you ask them. All right. That tapioca there... that's my son's favorite, too. What do you say, Franklin? Thank you. You're welcome. You know, Reverend, Mike here... he, uh... he left the Klan for us, and that... that's why we're in this... what you might call predicament. Where y'all been sleeping? In the car. All right, then. Am I understanding that you would like a room for that man? And his family. You know who that man is? I know him as a brother in Christ, Alvin. And I know him as a brother in the Knights, Reverend. I'm sorry. I'm booked up. You're booked up? Can't do it, Reverend. You be careful with your new friend, Reverend. - Dumbass Negro. - I just want to say the pie was good. Thank you very much. - Yeah. - How many pieces you eat this time? Uh, that was him! That's him. That is you. - Hi. What's going on? - Hey, Daddy. How you doing? What? I got a booger hanging from my nose? This here's Michael, that's Judy, and this is Franklin. They're gonna be staying with us for a while. Well, welcome. Uh, let us get your things to... I figure that, uh, they could stay downstairs in Kelvin's room. - Kelvin, you can sleep on the couch. - My room? Kelvin, go and help them with their belongings and show them down. Yo, we better go home, head out. Thanks for dinner, Ms. Kennedy. - Yup. - Reverend. Yeah. Night. God bless. I guess, just follow me. I know, I know. I know. You're probably upset 'cause they're under our roof out of wedlock. And I... I should've... I should've called you and told you that I was gonna have dinner already. Oh, shoot, David. You miss two out of three meals chasing the Lord's work, but this, this is... Janice... they're living out of their car. They got no food. They got their kid. You know that Clarence... he knows her pretty good. You and I both know we are not talking about her or her son. How could you let that man in this house and endanger your family like this? His woman said that he's left the Klan and that's why they're in this state. Did he tell you that? I've been praying. I've been praying for some kind of sign. Now, if this ain't a sign, then I don't know what is. I love your heart... and you know I share your faith in God, but I'm just not sure I share your faith in men. Yeah, go talk to your son. Yeah. Hey, wait up there. I know you must be bothered, but he... You know I don't agree with your ways, but bringing your almighty struggle into our house? - He left the Klan. - Left what? You don't leave the Klan, Daddy. It's in you. See, you see nothing from up in those pulpits. I deal with guys like him every single day on these grounds. They hate us. And now he's sleeping in my bedroom. Son. Mm-mm. You don't have to be doing that. It's all right. Come in. Come in. Oh. What, he asleep already? - Yeah. - All right. Try to get yourselves some sleep, and we'll... we'll see you in the morning. Reverend, thank you so much. All the praise go to God. Michael, gonna tomorrow see if we can fix you up with some work. - Have a good night. You sleep well. - You, too. So, what did that little deer ever do to you? That's the best thing you could do for him. That's what my daddy taught me. One time, we was hunting. I must... must've just been about Franklin's age. I was out in the woods, all alone, and this deer come right up to me. And I was thinking, how cute... oh, how cute this little thing was. Like old Bambi and all that other shit, you know? And I knew in that moment that he knew something about me, that he could sense something about me. And I knew we was gonna be friends, and he knew it. And all of a sudden, just bam! My daddy blows its head right fucking off. And he called me a pussy when I cried. I realized then that's the worst thing you can do for them... make friends with them. 'Cause they get comfortable with you, they're just gonna end up getting killed. All right, then. Start tomorrow. Ma, there ain't no hot sauce? I forgot the hot sauce. You can't have no pork chop with no hot sauce, now. - I'll go get it. I'll go get it. - What you gonna do? Something's wrong with this. It don't taste right. What did I say, G? You tell them what I said. - Hey! It's good, though. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - Mike! Look who came for dinner! - Y'all good? - Hey, Mike. - What's up there, little D? Hey. - Hey, baby. - Hi. Can I get the hot sauce, please? - Hot sauce? - It's hot, now. I know. That's why it's called "hot sauce." Oh. I'll go wash up. We got some plates in there for y'all. I'm not hungry. Thank y'all. - Be careful, now. - It might be too hot for you, Franklin. - Ooh! - Oh, that's good. Number four, Ronny. He's finally gonna do it. There he goes. Waiting on the outside. That's what you've been waiting for. Look at him go. Yes, sir. Oh! Couple more cars to pass and he'll be in the lead! Look at him coming back right there on the front. Can we go down into the pits? I want to play in Tom's car. - We got to sit up here. - There he goes, folks. - Now, you want to get some roasted nuts or something? - No, I'm okay. Another great turn. He's making his final move. And now he's got the lead, folks! He's got the lead! That's what I'm talking... Oh! Oh! ...banks off the wall. Stay back. You sit right there. You don't move, all right? - Yes, sir. - Keep an eye on him. Well, they didn't say a damn thing. I got a feeling if there was something bad, - they would've come on out. - Oh, good Lord. Hello, Mike. Come here. Saw you at the races. Hoped you'd come down, see if he was okay. Well, no matter what's gone down between us, it's still Ronny, you know? Listen, I know I can be a pigheaded son of a gun. But when you split, I... I mean, I'm just... I'm just too old to lose a son. That's how I think of you, Mike. So, come on home. You don't belong living with niggers. I'm just here for Ronny. - Hazel misses you something awful. - Look, it's just harder now. Yeah, of course it is. That fucking Kennedy bossing you around and shit. Christ, I thought you were gonna get rid of him for this town. Now you're his whipping boy. Well, that ain't no way to live. - Look, it ain't nothing like that. - Yes, it is. You hear that? It's that old sound of nothing... again. The sound of nothing, huh? Man, your bullshit's so loud right now, my fucking ears is ringing. Yeah! Hey, Burden! Got a visitor! - Judy? - What you doing here? Well, you know, we had leftovers from the dinner drive, so I thought y'all could use them. That's so thoughtful of you, Judy. You shouldn't have. Can't take all the credit. Toosie and Jan cooked their behinds off. Y'all enjoy your lunch. - Yeah. - Thank you. Ah, appreciate you. - Hey. - Hey. Seems like a good gig for you. - It's a paycheck. - Mm-hmm. Well... I'm real proud of you. Tell your old lady thanks for us. - Appreciate you. - One fine meal. I'll tell her you say that. Fine meal from a fine woman. What? Ain't no shame in that. Man, you think you're fucking funny? - What you gonna do? - Let that go, man. Just keep your mouth shut about my girl, everything be cool. I don't think you get it. I'm the boss here, boy. I ain't nobody's boy, man. Listen, it's been one hell of a hot morning, and we need to just chill. Mike, chill out, man. Al, come on, man. Shit, I'm just fucking with you. But I'd sure love to tap that ass. What'd you say, nigger? Get off me! Get him off of me! - Get off him, Mike! - Say it again! - Get him off of me! - Say that again! I fucking dare you! Chill out. Chill out. Chill out. - You out your goddamn mind? - Did you hear what he said? - Get him out of here. - Come on, Clarence. Let's get out of here. - Come on! - Nah, Mike! Oh, fuck y'all. He said "nigger," huh? - Yeah. - So, he got fired, then? Well, yeah. He needs to go back to where he belongs. - Back to the Klan? - He actually said "nigger"? Sister Kennedy, it weren't like that. All right, so he... I don't think the man know what he saying half the time. And it was over Judy. It was all over the place. Clarence, that man don't know nothing but how to hate. Can't get rid of hate unless you replace it with something else. H-He love Judy and Franklin. That should be the first step to help to let go. The boy is Klan. And he's not all that smart to boot. You know, I feel sorry for boys like that. They've been told that being born white is the end-all, be-all. But then they got to look at their sorry-ass lives. White, male, poor, raised up in... in brutality and addiction, lacking education, lacking... Teeth. Lacking teeth. What you gonna do? So, what you gonna do? I'm gonna pray. Klan... bastard! I do not want him here. What? I, me, the man... do not want that man in our house. But... this family, that man... If I abandoned him now... I won't be able to preach no more. Are you drunk? More drunk than sober. Not as drunk as I ever been. Goddamn it, Mike! I already got one child to deal with! - I don't need a-fucking-nother! - I was protecting your ass. None of this would've... Protecting me by getting your ass fired? By calling him a fucking nigger? None of this would've happened if you didn't come on down there wearing that goddamn dress, trying to flirt with all those fucking guys! Are you fucking crazy? Is that what's going through your fucked-up mind? That's what you think of me? You think I'm some fucking whore trying to get over on your foreman? Is that what you think? Is that what you... God. Yeah... Maybe I should just... Maybe I should just go and get me another guy to get with. Oh, yeah, you get yourself another guy. - It's like you ain't never had a woman. - Well, I haven't! I got all this shit coming down on me! How am I supposed to deal with that, huh? I don't even know what I'm fucking doing here, with you, Franklin and all these fucking people! Yeah, maybe I am crazy because this ain't my fucking life! This is our life! This is our life, and you keep fucking it up! Yeah! I'm fucking crazy, huh? I'm mad! I'm bad! I'm evil! Yeah, out of my fucked-up mind, huh? You stay... stay away from me. Been looking for you. What you doing over there? My uncle's grave. On his birthday, I go out, I throw him a little party. Them flowers is from my wife. He loved them balloon just about as much as he loved that wine. Is this your uncle you said... Was lynched by the Klan. Aren't you ever worried that's gonna happen to you? Should I be? Michael, if you truly want to leave the Klan, then your first step is admitting what you done. Here you go, uncle. You know, when I was growing up... my mama used to take the bus to work. And on that route she took home, there was a dog that was staked to the yard of this man's house. Many times, she'd see that dog being brutally beaten by that man. One day, when that man wasn't home... she got off the bus and she stole that dog, and she brung him home and she named him Solomon. That dog... he was so grateful. And if ever somebody went through the tiniest little squabble with my mama, she'd have to put Solomon in another room. Otherwise, that dog, he would bite. You can come with me if you want. Now, I could tell you ain't had the best of life. But you can't go through life thinking like a beaten dog. I ain't a thinking man like you, Rev. All I was trying to do was just find a nice little place for me and Judy to just have a home. Have a family. So I don't have to keep looking over my shoulder, feeling like I got to keep choosing sides. Align yourself with love, with God, and there will be no more sides. But you must take responsibility for your actions. Then you can repent and find redemption. I appreciate everything you done for us. I just know that being with you, it ain't safe. It's time for us to just move on. Saw a trailer on the side of the street that was selling for about a thousand bucks. I was wondering if maybe you knew somebody that might want to buy a building for about that much. Sir, if I call you my enemy, I'll walk through Heaven and I will punch God just to get to you. If I call you my friend... I'll walk through hell and I'll slap the devil for you. Hey there, Bob. Just in time for the end of lunch. Got no time for the good stuff today. I thought you ought to know, your boy Mike Burden... he done sold the deed to the shop over to that church. Well, maybe I got a minute to get off my feet. Want to go for a walk or something?

Ended up breaking almost every bone in my damn body. Got titanium in my knee here. Broke my collarbone, just like... - Get the fuck up! - Hey, man, get up! Look at me. Look at me. Well, this is a pleasant surprise. We was talking about you, and here you all are. It's a pity, though. We were gonna have a bonfire, maybe roast up some marshmallows.

You think this is ever gonna end? Never. We ain't ever gonna stop. That reverend, that church, that boy... we're gonna burn 'em down. And that woman of yours... I'm gonna enjoy that. You're a poison in the well of these folks. Anybody who takes you in. Can you please state your full name for the record? Michael Roderick Burden. You are aware that you're being deposed in the case of Kennedy v. Griffin? I am. In April, do you recall Tom Griffin signing over the deed to the property at 108 West Laurens Street to you? Yes, sir. And while staying with the Reverend Kennedy, you sold this property to the New Beginnings Baptist Church for $1,000? Yeah. While you were with the Kennedys, you also informed the Reverend Kennedy about a plot to kill him involving Tom Griffin? Yeah. He asked me to kill him. - "He"? - Tom Griffin. Is there anything more you would like to add to your statement, Mr. Burden? Yeah. June 23... 1996. I beat a man real bad. His name was... Grant Davis. You realize you're incriminating yourself in a felony? I acted alone.

I don't like saying it, really. They call me a nigger lover. We see the Klan moving and we see the skinheads and the neo-Nazi groups moving all throughout America, and we get discouraged. I bear witness in my spirit. There's hope! I see the other side of Mike that no one else sees. Behind closed doors, he's a different person. I can't see me hating someone just because of the color of their skin. She changed me. She's the one that started chipping at that itty-bitty hole that was in that wall.
