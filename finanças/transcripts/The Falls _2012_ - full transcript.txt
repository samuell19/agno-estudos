My name is RJ Smith. Or now Eider Smith. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Or you can use the abbreviation LDS, if you want. I'm twenty years old and I'm going on a mission in two days. This is my mother, my father... ...And my sister Mary Anne. We are told at a young age that it is our duty as men to serve God as missionaries for 2 years. Mormons are told: If you proselytize honestly and well, will you become a better husband, father, student... ...And work better at your job. I was raised to believe that. I know the church is true and I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. This is my retirement party. This is my friend Elise. So far there have only been fleeting kisses, cuddles and dry runs between us. She's a real sweetheart. This is how I end each evening: With a prayer. This is how I start each morning: silently in prayer. Thanks for coming, I appreciate it. Enjoy your meal! Do you remember when he was that big? You look great. -And he travels the world! family night food, board games, charades, readings of Scripture. The Mormon faith is truly a fountain of health. This is the MTC or Missionary Training Center where Elders prepare for the mission field. At first I was a little bitter that I was only 6 hours away to proselytize. Then I realize our Heavenly Father has his reasons for doing this. At the waterfall This is the building. How was the bus ride? -Good. Smelled like diapers the whole time, but... -You get your own keys. Let's see... bathroom... Wardrobe... That's it. There's the kitchen. Perfect. Yes, it's a great area too, you'll like it. So you're the jock. It's going ok. It's always said: Not so modest, you're not that great. That's Eider Merrill's bed, and this is yours. So keep it tidy. By the way, where is Eider Merrill? -In a meeting. But you'll get to know him soon. Tell me how is he? Eider Merrill... His father is a member of the First Quorum. I'm sure you knew that. He reads a lot, eats lucky charms like they're going out of style. Don't know, was there anything specific you wanted to know? -No, just like that. You will meet him soon. Sometimes you don't like each other. If this is the case, we will find a more suitable one for you. Or you wait a few months for a new missionary companion. Eider Harris... And you must be my new companion. Elder Smith. And you must be Eider Merrill. -Exactly. Did Elder Harris show you around a bit? -Yes a little. Then I'll let you now... I'm looking forward to your reports., \See you. Goodbye, Elder Harris. Thanks for the tour. -No problem. He is nice. I may be glad to be here. Really excited. I also look forward to my missionary work. Schön. Good to know. Would you like to start our fellowship with a prayer? -Absolutely. Are you ready? where are you from again -Salt Lake City. And you from Idaho, right? Where have you served before? -On the coast. Toll. And what do you like to do? I like sports. Outside of competitions, I'm a drummer. I'm learning to play the guitar... In a way. I don't have them with me. And you? No idea. I've been on a mission for so long... I don't do anything else. do you have a girlfriend at home -Fortunately not. do you have one Yes, we've been together for a while. -What's her name? - Elise, And how long? -Three years. Wonderful. Do you have a picture? She is pretty. Are you ready? -Yes, thanks. We still have a lot to go through. I have some planning to do for tomorrow. First of all, we need to get you a bike. Sleep now, the drive was long and we start early in the morning. That wasn't bad. Don't you need help? No, rest! By the way, the left side of the dresser is yours and the top fridge compartment. Do you need a break, Eider? -I think so. We're meeting David Fellows this afternoon, but before that we'll get you a bike. And from 2 a.m. I'll take you on missionary work. Next week we meet some candidates, including Lydia Davis, a possible convert. That's pretty much it. Are you ready? I'm ready. How are you, ma'am? Everything great? A good day for you? -Until now... My name is Eider Merrill, and I am with Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints. Na Here's my card if you want to call. This is for you, and don't feel rushed. Thank you for your time. -With pleasure. Have a nice day! real good job -Thanks. How are you? -Good. My name is Eider Smith. How did you do that? My name is Eider Smith, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Nice talking to you. How did you do that? -What? -The lady there... You know, that doesn't sound real... But already. You just have to... Made! -Your first? Congratulations! Hug? It's okay like that. We just don't want... I was just energetic... How was that now? -Good. ...carved on those tablets what we have today as the Book of Mormon. Do you belong to a religion? We have to go, we didn't know it was taking so long. It was a pleasure. Not bad. -You could have... offer the book. - Would that have worked... are you Then can you tell us something about it? Well, I know I don't care. I am strict christian. no -Do you know who Joseph Smith is? Actually, I'm on my way to the concert... And how did it go? -Great. We were proselytizing. Some baptisms, conversions? -Not yet. Maybe you're not cut out for this. That was a joke. Sisters, may I introduce... Sisters Tulsa, Brass, Oelsen, this is Eider Smith. Glad sisters. You know Eider Merrill. -Hello, sisters. Nurse Tulsa is doing a tour. \If you like... Fine, then come with me! -Great. We'll go to them later. Six? do you sell anything no sir So what? Are you Jehovah's Witnesses or something? No, from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Thanks guys, but I'm not very religious. I can leave you the Book of Mormon and mark some places and... ...I'll leave you my number... ...And you can always reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns. That's clear. Thanks for looking guys. Have a good time! -You too. Dear Mom, Dad, Mary Anne! Mission life is going well and I guess I'm getting the hang of it. Missionary life is entirely routine. We get up early. After the prayer, Elder Merrill and I go for a run. After breakfast and washing up, we study the Scriptures. We're usually on the road by eight. Missionaries speak about the gospel of salvation. All over. At any time, We teach most of the day proselytize those who are interested in the truth of our scriptures, keep appointments with candidates... ...and plan for upcoming meetings. Once a week we have P-Day or Personal Day, to write letters and for other activities. Although we are scolded for all sorts of things every day, overall it's going well... ...And so far smoothly. I miss you all. In love... ...R.J. You must be Eider Merrill. i am jim -I am glad. And you're... -Eider Smith. Come in! One fine spring day in 1823, Joseph Smith went into the woods. He knelt down and began to offer his heart's desires to God. Suddenly a power seized him that came over him completely. She was so strong that he could not speak. It took all his strength to call out to God may he free him from the clutches of the enemy, that had gripped him when he was ready to sink into despair. Surrender to becoming. Not some imaginary doom, but the power of a being from the invisible world with miraculous powers, that he had never felt before. At this moment of greatest terror... ...he saw a pillar of light... ...right above his head, brighter than the sun until they gradually... ...to him. Then two people appeared to him. One pointed to the other and said: This is my beloved son. listen to him That was the First Vision. We know the Book of Mormon is true. Eider Smith and I can tell you exactly how it changed us all. It brought us closer together... and so will it be for you and your family. A little more detail... Gladly. Where does Jesus say to us we would have to marry in a temple of eternity, to attain supreme glory? In Doctrine and Covenants. May I have a look at your writings? Let's see... There it is. Isn't that a revelation about polygamy? No, about eternal marriage. It states that under certain circumstances... Multiple marriages are allowed. And under... ...what circumstances does God permit them? Joseph Smith practiced polygamy long before this revelation. Polygamy, according to Jacob, was only allowed to spread his seed. Besides Emma, ​​how many children did Joseph Smith have? I don't see the relevance... To see if he wanted to spread his seed. Do you know what they called him? I heard some names. -The psychic. Clairvoyants were not uncommon in New York around 1820. They were impostors, crooks. They claimed they could find Indian treasures. They looked into stone or glass and stared into a hat... and found the imaginary treasure. -We know all this. That too? One of his wives was 13 years old. So not only was he a polygamist, he was also a pedophile. It is now clear that we were brought here under false pretenses. And for preparing for today... and have far more knowledge of our writings than you led us to believe. I'm sorry but I... ...don't think it will continue here. -Wait, I didn't mean to be rude. It's all true. Elders...! Eider Merrill... Is everything ok? fine. Certainly? I'm doing well. I just can't believe what he said. Excuse me. I should be your guiding oath. Sorry, That I lost control Everything's fine, you haven't lost her. Why is this guy inviting us out to dinner just to ambush us? IM not sure. I wanted dessert. I beg your pardon? I wanted dessert. These brownies smelled...! What then? Was? I've never been that serious. -I know, I believe you. This is my serious face. -Your serious face... I would very much like to see your serious face. Is that it? is that your serious face Is a good serious face. There are three degrees of glory. First the Kingdom of Heaven, supreme. The Earthly Kingdom for honorable people who reject the Holy Message. And the Telestial Kingdom for the sinners. And despite the many murderers and thieves, it's still a paradise That sounds really nice. The thought is to be with God in the highest kingdom. All three sound good. Still, the safest thing is to earn the Kingdom of Heaven. Because, Miss Sanborn, as you continue reading the Book of Mormon, you will probably find our statements confirmed. We believe you too deserve the highest kingdom with our Heavenly Father. We want to ask you because you seem to find truth in our writings... Would you like to be baptized and become a member of our church? I'm not sure. -There is a singles club. That's not the same. Karl Malone was on the Original Dream Team... I'm just saying, besides Stockton, there were better players: Bird, Johnson, Jordan... Did you see Williams play? He can jump out of the stadium. Is 10 cm taller and twice as fast. What are you talking about? Stockton was known for his speed. He had eyes behind, he didn't have to be big. I've been talking to Nurse Tulsa a lot lately. cute. She taught me sign language. Are you going to the conference later? - Yes, it's all in here. If it's not in here. -But you planned it. I'll schedule it when it's in here. Hallo... So... I better go. Thank you friend... Good this way? -Yes. Please, friend. Remember, I'm a missionary! -Yeah, me too. This is Eider Smith. Yes, I have it lying here in front of me. Are you ready? We had two conversations... .15 Books of Mormon delivered... ...zero trials and zero baptisms. Where have you been this morning? Did community service with Sister Tulsa. You know you shouldn't be alone with girls on a mission. There were others there You shouldn't leave your companion's side either. Everything OK? -Fine. Here, this has come for you. You should have been there too. i miss you everyday I'm so proud of you and your work... Do you like... ...Something to drink? No thank you. - That goes for both of us. Are you sure? sorry for the mess Please excuse that. I know that's rude, but... I don't know, I'm pretty excited. I haven't had many guests lately. Surely you have a doctor's prescription for it. No, I haven't. It's okay, we're not the police. I hope not. They don't dress as nice as you. -Is correct. Thank you for getting in touch again. After you were gone last time I threw your book on the table here... ...and there it was for days and I ignored it. Then, A few days later I sat here and watched TV but nothing went right. Over a hundred channels and nothing clever Like I took it and started reading and... Well, it wasn't that bad. There were wars and... ...a lot of incomprehensible stuff. So I called you so you can explain it to me, tell me more about it. Yes of course. Do you currently practice a religion? I am Catholic but no longer practicing. Don't tell my mom! Were you in the army? Yes that was me. In Iraq? I, Sir... im Iraq. You have done your country a great service. -Thanks. Are you still an active soldier? -No, I was honorably discharged. Were you hurt? Not physically. What happened? -Eider, he doesn't want that. No that's fine. A lot of guys don't even want to talk about it, but I don't mind. I enlisted with my brother Mark. We were stationed at Ash Shura, been there for quite a while. We were as good as home, counting the days. They sent us a new lieutenant. Totally inexperienced, fresh out of college. We are just... ...moved from one place to another. Then the point where we... ...thought we were in the minefield. They teach you to turn back directly, following in your own footsteps. So that you don't step where you haven't been before. Mark war... ...Right in front of me, when we went back. I have no idea what happened. He stepped too far to the right or left or something. Suddenly... ."..I was flushed red, covered in blood. I thought I died! Then I looked up. Saw what happened. Was actually my own blood. The only thing I could think of was: How am I supposed to explain this to mom? You guys really don't want anything? Maybe we'd better talk about your cause, yes? Get out of Iraq. Jesus won there, that much is clear. Jesus is pretty awesome. That's what all kids say, right? Eider Merrill has been slacking off a bit lately. He fell asleep again today. And during our area conference, he sat in silence. If... ...Cliff takes the shift, and that's open, it's his shift... Everything OK? You seem so distracted lately. How do you mean? Don't know... forget it. -Tell me I'm curious! Sometimes you don't seem to want to be here. -Why do you say that? Initially, you were up at 5:30 am and excited about teaching, but... But what? It just seems like you're slacking off. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I appreciate your sincerity and you are right. You're right, I have to go back... -I was just observing, not judging. I just want to make sure you're okay. It's not that easy to explain, sorry. It's just... ...no idea... I've been thinking a lot lately and... For example... Our dinner with Mr. Davis last week. There's a man comfortable in his life... ...And content is completely without religion. We come to his house... ...twenty years old... ...with the intention of teaching him and his family to reconsider their lives. That's what missionaries do. Three weeks of training at the MTC doesn't qualify me for it. Doubts are normal, everyone has them. I know. I know it's difficult. Also for you. I hear you have secular music in the headphones. I saw your eyes on Sister Tulsa. -What? No... Don't tell me your faith isn't being tested all the time... Of course he is. So how are you? All right, sometimes. Sometimes I'd like to be at home, sometimes I'd like to be at school... All in all I like being here. I also. I like being with you. You are a good companion. Everything is going to be alright. Are you two always this collegial? -Excuse me...? Saw him rubbing his arm there. I'm taking it easy, just wanted to know if you're all like that. Mormons, right? I'll pay for that. Shall we go? -Yes, thanks. L.D.S... Church of Jesus Christ... right? Where do you want to go? Do not go away! shall you not convert me? teach me? Got a letter from my mom yesterday. She wants to set me up with this girl at home. -Do you know her? All my life. If I just ignore her, maybe she'll get married before I have to say no. I do not know either... At home they drop like flies. You should keep an eye on Elise. -I do not know... I always say what should be, should be. That's what happened to Eider Harris, by the way. -I beg your pardon? His girlfriend wrote to him: I met someone and am marrying him. That's tough. That's why he's so tense! window paste... The guys from the restaurant. Just keep going. Where are you going? Shall we take you with us? No, everything is fine, thank you. You shouldn't be out so late, rabble comes out at night. -Come! Worth... Get in, we'll take you home, it's safer. Come on, get in! -Let's drive, Craig. We can easily see that if you like to touch each other. You're from Utah, right? What area there? I'm from Utah, small town, Ferron. Have you heard of it? My father couldn't get a job because of your people. Drunk into oblivion. You only care for your own kind, you hypocrites. fags! Am I pissing you off, faggot? RJ, what are you doing? Come on, leave him! Don't hold back, let him! are you okay I'm still a little upset. I've never seen you angry. I'm usually passive-aggressive. -He was hospitalized! I know it's terrible. I hate to say it... But he deserved it. Mormons are not allowed to argue. Mormons are not allowed to do many things. We should keep that to ourselves. I agree. are you really alright -It's okay. Your hands are all bruised. Sorry... -Not bad. Thanks. did i look cool Actually pretty cool. When someone looks cool fighting in a shirt and tie... Then is it me? -Then it's you. That's really cold. -It's ice cream. You got it from the freezer. The catcher in the rye Eider Merrill's disinterest was contagious. We didn't teach much this week or last week. And we may not, but we went to the cinema tonight. I don't think it's worth serving a mission without having fun. Why don't you ever talk about wrestling? - No need, I'll do it. Anyway thanks for your help the other day. -You would have done the same for me. You're slim for a competitor. And you talk more about basketball than wrestling. Sorry for being such an idiot that night too. You weren't an idiot. Anyway, thanks for listening. -No problem. Your feelings were absolutely justified and completely normal. What feelings? Doubt... Confusion. Then do you have them too? -Naturally. Have you ever been tempted in proselytizing? -To what? I do not know... anything. What a missionary should not do. -Yes. Excuse me Elder... ...I need to step out. Sorry, I have to too. I guess we both have a bit of stage fright, don't we? Allegedly. False alarm. Worth! I believe what I... ...really want to find out is... Did you want to kiss me last night? What? -While half asleep I saw you above me. I... I don't know... That is allright. Eider... I try to keep those feelings at bay. I've been praying to God in tears. Hoping that one day I will love and marry a woman. that I want to kiss her wants to hold her and have sex with her. But I can not. That's not how I'm built. When we finished, we both prayed. Then we got on our bikes and rode back to our apartment. We didn't talk about it the rest of the evening. We are bad Mormons. I also think. Are we headed for the outer darkness? I don't know what do you mean? -I think we're safe candidates. And? R.J... Have you dated girls before? -Not really. And what about... what's her name? We got close, but no. The first time I kissed a girl I was bound to fail because I was praying I should like it... ...And when it happened, it was just a kiss. Not more. \Nuss it there? I've always known my feelings, but... ...well, there is... There's a park near my parents' house called Hope Grove. It is located on an embankment near the falls and... ...I didn't know what the park was for. Once I woke up very early, didn't fall asleep again, got up and went shooting baskets. Gradually I heard something. I looked around for the sounds but couldn't see anything. So I went. And I saw two men. One on his knees, the other stretched against a tree. And I stood there and watched. One of them noticed me and so I went closer... I've been attracted to men before, but this... ...Very different from that. Somehow I've gone far now. This is completely right. i like it when you talk I have a feeling you wouldn't get around to it otherwise. I still remember... I was out to dinner with my family when I was about nine. In the restaurant I sat next to my dad and... ...a few tables down I saw this handsome boy my age. I then said in front of mom and dad and brother and sister: That's a pretty boy! They totally ignored me, but at home... my father took me and yelled not to think such a thing... ...And never say anything like that again. There's always been a rift between me and my father because... He must have always known. Why don't you open forever? -We studied the scriptures. Oh yes? Which verse? Verse Nephi, Chapter 2, Verse 15. He is good. And what are you planning to do now? -Keep studying, as I said. Let's play basketball. After that I don't feel like it at the moment. I would like to go Also, it's Monday... You have no meetings scheduled today. So let's go! Yes, we'll be right there. Damned. And what have you been up to lately? Not too much. Proselytizing... the usual. Your numbers are low. In fact, the lowest in the district. What's going on there? Why are you looking at him, you are the leading eider... You weren't in church, we had to pull your numbers out of your nose... we were sick were you both sick? I was sick and then infected Eider Merrill. -For real? You should have said something. The bishop and mission president were concerned. I will inform you. By the way, you are a HOR. Was? You had an H and a 0. That was an R. Walk in! How are you guys? Long time no see! How did you do? -Really good. I haven't heard from you. I thought you should hunt me down, convert me and baptize me. We're glad you called. I read what you marked for me. Do you mind? I know you shouldn't have anything to do with this. -Go ahead. Rodney... Exactly, the scriptures... The writings you marked in yellow were very beautiful. But... ...repetitive. And it happened... and it happened... - Yes, always the same thing. Mark Twain said the Book of Mormon is a boring detail of invented history... and a dreary plagiarism of the New Testament. Mark Twain probably didn't have a good word for any religion. Or? I agree. I suppose you're right about that. -\Where do you get your information from? Mainly from the internet. can i see You gave it to me... -The bag of... ...the Grass. Smells really good. -Yeah, that's one of the best things about it. Can I see...? The whistle? No problem. RJ, what are you doing? -I want... I'll try it. Why? -I'm just curious... Is there anything already in there? - Yes, it's already stuffed. I saw you do it once, I do that too. Keep it on the side... That hole there is called a carburetor. hold it shut ...And there is pressure in the glass. Then you put it in your mouth, light it up, pull it, let go of the carburetor and it goes deep. I'll guide you, go ahead, start! People... What am I supposed to feel? Haven't done that before. -Never? i am mormon -He's Mormon. Then you feel... ...Interesting. Chris, if you like, feel free! But it's not compulsory. Do you like? do you have it I don't feel anything. Maybe you don't have enough or not right...? Can you guys watch tv? Not really. Haven't watched TV for a long time, but... A little doesn't matter. - I don't even know what's going on anymore. A little certainly doesn't matter. -Do you want to see a movie? I have... ...Finding Nemo and The Princess Bride, Yes, they are all... -Saving Private Ryan... They're fine. -What do you want to see? Full Metal Jacket, They sound... -Increasingly violent. war movies... can you watch something like that? Sometimes I watch them. Sex And The City - Der Film. -Sex And The City? Women in New York who have sex with anyone. Isn't that the series with the three snipes and their mom? You mean all in the family. -No, this is Golden Girls. do you like my knife -Yes it's beautiful. Do you have something to snack on? - We're talking about the knife. That's pretty. Has this been here all along? Even before I moved in. I don't even know what that's supposed to be. Remember, raise the roof? That was cool. I have no idea what you're talking about. Chris and I have never seen these films uncensored. Mormons watch a lot of edited videos. For example, the Casino and GoodFellas versions only had 35 minutes. We also showed Rodney favorite Mormon movies. What a mess! It's a cartoon or something, but... Who cares how many cows a woman is worth... We were spending more and more time with Rodney. He is unable to work and mostly at home. There are times when he's a little nervous. He just needs human contact. I tell myself even though Chris and I neglect our duties we do good by keeping him company. What are you planning to do when you get home? I'm not sure. I'll be on a mission for a while. Probably study. -The same. That doesn't sound very enthusiastic. How old are you anyway? -Twenty. Twenty? I wasn't in the military when I was 20. Worked at the assembly plant for two years and saved. One day I resigned. Without notice. Just resigned. I got in the car, oil change, new tires, forked my brother Mark up and down to 35. I drove across the country for three months. The best time of my life. do something like that! -I always wanted that. That would be great. -You are twenty! Go out and live! Do drugs, get drunk! Drink your way into the blackout! Don't remember anything! Have sex with girls and sex with boys! Have sex with both at the same time! You have to do that! Steal all of Hans Christian Andersen's books from a library! Go to jail and spend a night there! Make experiences! Eat Taco Ball! Something about you two is different. Im Ernst. Something has changed since we first met. What's happening? What do you mean? You're both in a slightly different shape now. I get it now. Hope it doesn't bother you. -Are you kidding? Nothing gayer than the military. What I've seen... Nobody is straight in the cover hole. I can not believe it. Two gay Mormons smoking pot are sitting here in the living room eating tacos! Are you alright, RJ? Look boys... I don't care if you're gay... ...hetero or... ... preferably masturbating. You are fine with me. Do you still want am I reading this book? How do you feel about all of this? What do you mean with all that? just you and me ...And the mission. I guess I'm still trying to understand everything. And you? How do you feel? I am not an apostate. I still have a deep love for Jesus. Me too. I think we're both on the verge of something new. And it's going to be tough. But we can do it. It will be alright. And? Worth! Good day Eider. Good day, President Pierce. -Please take a seat. Well, I'll get straight to the point. Elder Harris told me he knocked on your door yesterday... ...And then entered your accommodation. Why didn't you graduate? -I thought I had. Now our area manager saw us in bed together. I don't know how it happened and I don't care. But... ...I can only assume it was about more than unorthodox sleeping. What do we do now? I dont know. I was also made aware of your permanent absence... ...At church and at missionary meetings. Also... I find this behavior unacceptable and ungodly. You are not here to entertain any unconscious perversions. You did this as a missionary under the eyes of our Heavenly Father... Goddamn! -Not... What? Saying God's name meaninglessly? I spoke to the stake president about this... Yes, I'm still a Mormon. -I also. But my perspective has changed. So you better stop wasting your parents money... Mine hasn't changed that much. -\How do you mean that? Maybe you're a bigger fag than me. ...And drive home and deal with it. Be with your family and get right with God. And, Richard, did you... ...to say something? Nun... ...thanks. And God bless you. Could you send in Eider Harris as well? Hallo, Paps. Hello RJ Your mom and your sister are in bed. Hungry? Spoke to your bishop a few days ago. We talked for a long time. Is... ...told me a story. About a young missionary who came to him before the mission, and told him the thoughts he had... ...for other guys. The bishop said he should serve a mission. That would be good. Go on a mission, he said. You will come back and meet a wife... He also said he didn't have to mention it anywhere. The Lord will resolve these matters in due course. This young missionary came back after honorable mission, went to the bishop and said he still had these thoughts, but... ...he listened to his mentors when they said if he meets the right one, everything changes. And a few months later he met a beautiful young woman. They married within six months had their first child at the end of the year and the second a year later. Dad, I don't know what to say... -There's nothing to say. I went on a mission. I wanted you to go to one to have experiences like this so we could talk about it. -I have done my missionary work. And I have had such experiences and really enjoyed it. I know that, my son. It is only... Damn Ricky...! You are a winner, a champion! Also: You've done your missionary work, and that's very honorable, but... ."..my son, you have difficult decisions ahead of you. They affect your future. It's going to be tough for all of us. Ricky, this town and the church know all about you. Do you think they don't get what happened? -Yet. And what are you going to do now? Nothing. Nothing? I let people fantasize wildly. How so? -I don't owe anyone an explanation. You are my son. And first of all love you. But... ...I cannot help you in this matter. Your family cannot help you. So what are you gonna do? Will you at least try maintain your reputation in the Church? would you be -I don't see how. The Church is unlikely to recommend compassion for people like me to its members. people like you Ricky... It was all just guesswork! -Assumptions? I'm gay. I didn't choose that. It's been in me for a long time. I told everything to my beloved sister. I didn't want to leave her in the dark. She understood. I told Elise, who already knew but wanted to hear from me. She was hard to console. Today I meet the stake president. I see him before I meet the Council. -Take place. RJ, I'd like to start with a prayer. Is that in order? Heavenly Father, thank you for RJ coming here safe... ...And please bless this young man and guide him through this difficult time. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. RJ, I've known you since you were a kid. I was at your baptism. I watched you grow up, watched you go to high school, went to college... ...And I appreciated you for your mission. If someone had told me I would read these words on this paper, ten years ago I would have... RJ, tell me why are you here today son? To talk about my future as a member of this church. This is a very serious matter, don't you know? And it can be grounds for excommunication, do you realize that? First... ...please tell me the details of your relationship with Eider Merrill. I am sorry, but... ."..I don't know if I can talk about it. You broke a very sacred right. -That's correct. I did that, I can't deny it. Did you want to go on a mission? -Naturally. I've always wanted that. And you wanted to serve, even though you knew that about yourself. I'm not the first nor the last gay man to be sent on a mission. The church... ...doesn't offer us any way of dealing with it honestly. As for Eider Merrill... Elder Merrill and I were fellow missionaries. We served our church well. I can neither speak for him I'll go into more detail... ...except... ...that I say I have strong... ...Feelings for Eider Merrill. My feelings for him are... stronger than for... ...every other person. And acted on my feelings I see no wrong in that, still shame. You should be ashamed! And this church should be ashamed! I was raised believing I was part of something. Part of my family, my friends. And now because I am who I am, I can't be that. I am excluded from this. I'm not sorry. I hope you know that. I'm not sorry. How did it go? -Quite well. I told him I don't want no honor back... ...And don't go to the council either. Was? Why not? So where do I go from here? Maybe I should just throw a dart at a map... Or I see where the world takes me.
