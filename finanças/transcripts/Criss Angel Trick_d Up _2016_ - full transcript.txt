I, I wanna go everywhere.' I gave you a gift which you brought today. I have here. Yes. I brought, uh, two books one that has some meaning to you. 'I'm familiar with this one.' I want you to touch one of the two books. Okay, so we'll use the one that you're familiar with. Fair? "Dracula." Okay. Now, what I'm gonna ask you to do is I'm gonna go through the book and at any point, I want you to say "Stop." You just say "Stop" at any point you wish. Stop. Right there. Is that fair? Yep. Okay. I want you to remember the page number uh, the page number that would be right over here. Remember that page number. Yes. And I want you to... look at the first line and I want you to create a visual picture.. ...of that first line, whatever that line is. Try to create a visual picture as if you were in that... scene wherever that might take place. 'Okay?' Yes. Okay. Have your mom hold on to the book. Now, what I want you to do is to really visualize you're there. 'I want you see it.' It's interesting because.. ...it's actually not just you, is it? There is... someone else in this scene. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. 'And you're both' kind of questioning.. ...but then again agreeing at the same time. 'Am I correct?' Ye-yes. Yeah. There's a conflict of s-something.. 'Yes.' ...of there's two sides. 'It's like yin and yang. It's like good and evil.' 'Right?' Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Now, let's try something, just as an experiment. What was the page number? Uh, two-seven-eight. Two seventy-eight? So what I want you to do is you're gonna take the book and I want you to go um, and find that page number 278.. Okay. '...and read that line.' Two-seven-eight. Okay. Um.. Uh.. It's.. There is no, uh, there's-there's no page 278. It's torn out. It.. Uh.. As if.. But it wasn't just a.. No. It.. What have you done with it, mother? I don't know. Now, I gave you a present yesterday. I want you to please open up the little gift. Just rip it open. 'And it is a perfect match if you look' at this.. It is indeed. It's a perfect match. Mother? Marvelous. Marvelous. 'Who wants to help me?' I do. Okay. I want you to think of a person anybody you wish, whoever you want. This. This.. This will be our canvas and I want you to visualize if you would visualize the person's body that you're thinking of. Just get that person in your mind.

You know, well, let's make this easy. We'll use this sheet as a canvas. Let's cover him up. 'Okay.' Let's cover him up. Just cover him up. And I want you now to visualize, if you will.. ...that person that you're thinking of. Now, the person that you're thinking about.. Just send me. It's a celebrity, am I correct? Yes. It's actually in.. ...his field, he's probably the most successful.. ...in what he does. Yeah. And you're a big fan? Yeah. Are you thinking of first name, first letter, an "S"? Yes. Is it Steve? Yes.

But, I mean, to get my nails done with Criss Angel is, uh one of, like, the legendary moments of my life now. 'I think it's the other way around, bro.' Paris, look deep into my eyes.
