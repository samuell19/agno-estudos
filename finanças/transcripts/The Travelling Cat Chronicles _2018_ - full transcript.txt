I am a cat. As yet, I have no name. Lines spoken by a famous cat once upon a time. I, too, was a cat with no name. You seem happy today, Nana. Let's get going. This is my owner, Satoru. - ''Driving Safety Charm'' - We met five years ago. Five years ago, I was a proud stray cat. I'm an expert hunter, but sometimes they get away. Hey! Kitty! Satoru was a keen fan of mine back then. These fans can be quite valuable when hunting is unproductive. But don't get attached. Aloof, as usual. You can pet me when you bring me a present. But my life... My cat life took a dramatic turn one spring night. I was on my way to a cat meeting. One mistake can end your life. The life of a stray is harsh. No one will help you. No one. But just then, I remembered him. I'm hurt. Help me! Help me! Do something! Hey. Kitty? That was a close call! You called me, didn't you? You called for me. Good kitty. You remembered me. That's how I became Satoru's cat. He's a little helpless at times, but he's quite capable as a catservant. And above all... ...he cried for me. The Travelling Cat Chronicles Sorry I can't keep you, Nana. I'm really sorry. I heard it a million times. It's blowing up my ears. We're almost there. It's been a while! - It sure has! - Can I park here? Our parking lot's over there. OK. Nana. Nana... Will he come out? He will when he feels comfortable. I'll never feel comfortable. I'm never coming out. I won't ask you for details, but I'm sure it's a big deal if you're giving up your cat. I'm happy to take him. Coffee? It may not taste too good. Thanks, I'll have some. Where's your wife? At her parents'. We had some issues. But when I texted her about your cat, she responded. My wife loves cats. Maybe she'll come back when she finds out I've adopted one. I don't know what you did to drive her away, but I'm your bait to get her back? I've sunk to new lows. Sorry to burden you. I was surprised when I saw his photo. He looks just like Hachi. Maybe it is Hachi. Hachi? Sounds nothing like Nana. Time flies, doesn't it? It seems like just yesterday when you and I found Hachi. You remember? How could I forget? Yeah. Those were good times. See you, Satoru. See you, Satsuki. Kosuke! He's adorable! I'll ask my mom if I can keep him. No fair! I'm the one who found him! Sorry. You found him first, so he's your cat. He's light as air. So tiny. In the end, my dad wouldn't let me keep him. We even ran away from home. That was your idea! That really messed things up for me. Really? Really. Hurry! I know. This way. - Hurry! - Where were you... We're gonna get caught! Wait a minute! We're in trouble! You're not in trouble! Hurry! Wait a minute. I said, wait! Wait right there. What are you doing, Kosuke? - Sorry... - Hurry! There they are! You liar, Satoru! Running away didn't work at all! You never know. We could still pull it off! No way! They're on the roof! What are you boys doing? Kosuke! Come down right now! I'm dead. I'm going to get a beating! Don't give up! If you give up, the game's over! It's already over! Leave it to me. Satoru? That's dangerous! Come down! Stay back! Or I'll jump! According to Kosuke. Kosuke! Satoru! Dad! Come down! It's dangerous! - Satoru! - Calm down, sir! Kosuke, go stand on the ledge. No! That's crazy! You want to keep the cat, right? I can't! Why don't you keep him instead? You mean I can keep him? It's better than your friend and cat committing double suicide! Dad! Mom! Kosuke says he wants us to keep the cat! Then he won't jump! We'll adopt a cat or dog or whatever! Just stop him from jumping! We'd even adopt an alligator or hippo! Just come down! A hippo won't fit in our house! But a pygmy hippo will! We can do a pygmy hippo! OK! Yay! We did it! Hachi, you're so cute. Hachi. Hachi! Hachi, Hachi. Hachi! Wait a minute, Hachi! What are you doing? He's running away because you're chasing him! Dad. Dad. Look. Satoru's fever is breaking. Maybe it's Hachi's doing. Excuse me! Did you catch my cold? It's fine. Don't worry. ''Cat Scratcher'' Hachi was a good cat. When my dad was mad and I went to your house, he stayed on my lap. He knows who's in need of comfort. Whenever my parents fought, he'd always stay by the loser's side. My dad most of the time. Your dad was outmatched. A real pushover. You're so naive! Wise males always let the females win. Your spending money. I'm dividing it between your wallet and your coin purse. Don't spend it all at once. Spend wisely. Put your dirty laundry in this bag. Got it? You'd better listen! I'm helping you pack for your field trip. Help your mom. Mom packs your stuff for business trips. That's for my work, though. You should be saying, You're right. I'll pack myself next time. But I'll forget to pack something. That's why Satoru acts so lazy. He's copying you! Don't get hysterical. You're such a pain! Hey! I'm doing this for you! Forget it! Pack the rest yourself! I'm done! That was your fault, Satoru. Go apologize. It's too late for that! Mom is really mad. I'll tell you the secret to making up. A souvenir. - That's so unoriginal. - What? Any fight before a business trip was resolved by a souvenir. Every time. It's my trump card. What should I buy? Kyoto, right? There's a famous facial blotter paper. I brought it back from a Kyoto trip once. She loved it! Were you fighting then, too? Don't ask. It has to be from the Yojiya Store, though. It's a thin facial blotter for women. Yojiya? Yojiya. - Yojiya. - Yojiya. Will Mom like it? She said I had good taste for once. It's guaranteed. Was that a compliment, though? Sorry. I'm sure it was. How much money you got? About 3,000 yen. Hachi... Hachi... Two pairs of socks, a shirt. Mom. I'm sorry. That's OK. I was a little on edge. I'll buy you facial blotter paper from Yojiya. Dad's recommendation, right? I'll look forward to it. Go to sleep now. OK. Good night. Good night. I'm gonna buy my dad this. And for my dad... Maybe this. This cat looks a little like Hachi. What about your mom? I need to get facial blotter paper from some shop. It's famous but I forgot the name. I have no idea. Does it have to be from there? Yeah. It's my peace offering. I see. I hope I can remember the name. I'm going to buy this. Let's go look at those shops! - Where? - Over there. - There! - Let's go. Thank you. Satoru! Satoru, come with me. Just come. What's wrong? I'll explain later. We need to hurry. To where? Satoru? We need to go home. I'm home! Mom. I bought you a souvenir from Kiyomizu-dera Temple. Shut up! Get ready! We're going to Satoru's house. Go change your clothes. Satoru went home in the middle of the trip. What happened? His parents passed away. Don't be dense! Satoru's mom and dad died! It was an accident. They were trying to avoid a bike that turned into their path. The guy on the bike was safe. Satoru lost both his parents at once. Poor boy. I feel so sorry for him. Funeral Service Kosuke, hold the umbrella. I'm sorry for your loss. Hello. We're very sorry. Good evening. It happened so fast. Really. How is Kosuke? He seems OK now, but I'll keep an eye on him. Shall we sit? I think this is the facial blotter paper you were looking for from Yojiya. The peace offering. Facial blotter paper Yojiya Store Satoru... Thank you. This is the first time he's cried since he's come home. He finally cried. Thank you. We're looking after Grandma. She's already a handful. Satoru's in sixth grade already. He won't be that much trouble. Why don't the Miyawakis take him? They got married despite the family's objections. We can't ask them. So I guess he'll have to go to a facility. I suppose... It's for the best. We have no choice. Excuse me. I'll adopt Satoru. You're not even married. How can you raise a child? He's my nephew. It feels like the just thing to do. Just thing? You really do sound like a judge. But raising a child isn't cut and dry like the law. It's not theoretical. I'm not talking theoretically. I feel very strongly about this. What's wrong with you? You don't want to take him, yet you object to my adopting him? Do you want him to go to an orphanage? - That was awkward. - I'm shocked. She's as headstrong as her sister. It won't be easy. Satoru. Yes. I talked to your relatives. Why don't you come live with me? Can I bring Hachi? I move around a lot and live in company housing. No pets allowed. He's not a pet! He's family! Satoru? See? Look at this. And this. And this and this. He's always with me! Hachi is family! Family! Look at this. - And this and this and this! - OK, I get it. - Hachi is family! Look! - OK, Satoru. - And this! And this! - OK, OK. See? Satoru. Look at all these photos! OK, OK. Hachi is always with me. See? Sawada Photography Hey, Dad. Can we adopt Hachi? A cat? No way! But Satoru just lost his mom and dad. It'd be sad if he had to give Hachi up to strangers. They're his relatives, not strangers. But he doesn't even know them. I said, no! Some cats live for decades. Can you take that responsibility? I can! I will! You can say that once you're making your own money! I hate you! Kosuke! He wouldn't even adopt a cat for his son's best friend. He had no compassion for kids. I hated him. But you quit your job to take over his business. The only time we got on was when we talked about photography. I felt sorry for him when he said he was going to retire. One last smile. Make it good. OK! Thanks. But now I regret taking over this place. Why? He and my wife don't get along. He badgered her about an heir. When she miscarried our first child, know what he said? At least we know you're fertile. Is that why she left? Yeah. Sometimes I wish he was dead. Sorry. Every relationship is different. I loved my parents, but if I had your dad, I'm not so sure I could've loved him. Some people aren't meant to be parents. They're just not. I hope your wife comes back soon. She probably thinks I'm a coward. It's a conditioned reflex. I still can't talk back to my dad. I clam up when he yells at me. I may be in denial by wishing a cat will bring her back. Spineless! Don't use me as bait! Confront your dad! Nana... You know what? You and your wife should find a new cat. Taking Nana will be like rubbing the Hachi incident in your dad's face. He doesn't even remember Hachi. But you do. So you and your wife's cat should be a brand new cat free of any baggage. I agree. It's time you get out from under your dad's thumb. Kittens become independent within six months of birth. He really looks like Hachi. He might let you pet him now. Then I'll want to keep him. Thanks. For what? It made me happy. To know I have a friend who'd rely on me. I should thank you. It's nice to know I have a friend I can rely on. See ya. Come again! You and your wife should find a new cat. Hello? It's me. Um... What? Let's find a brand new cat. Are you kidding? Your dad would never allow it. Don't worry. I won't let him interfere. I didn't know you could open it. I only come out if I feel like it. Hello, Yoshimine? Glad you called. Nana's first arrangement didn't work out. Sorry, we just adopted a kitten. She still requires a lot of care. Can you wait two, three months? I see... Sorry. That's OK. I have other prospects. Thanks. Bye. Bye. You're so cute. I thought I'd try an old friend from middle school, but he just adopted a kitten. He's a nice guy, so I was counting on him. I have no intention of leaving you, Satoru. It's rude to set up these arrangements without my consent. But don't worry. I know someone who'll adopt you. Weren't you listening?! From: Shusuke Sugi Found someone yet? We can take him. OK. Are you sure you're OK? Don't worry so much. I'm just driving. I have a spotless record. I know... But it's a long drive. What if you get tired? I'll be fine. The weather's beautiful. We can see Mt. Fuji. Mt. Fuji! I'll send you a photo later. All right... We got a good look at Mt. Fuji, thanks to my aunt, the worrywart. What do you think? It's so majestic. Bigger is better! I wonder how many cats in Japan have actually seen the real Mt. Fuji? That makes me feel special! Sugi is a good guy. You'll like him. Long time, no see. Hey. Thanks for coming. I finally made it. It's nice here! Yeah. But cold. We're in the mountains. It gets much colder. Need help? I'm fine. How's Chikako? Full of energy, as usual. Good. So this is Nana? Hello. Nana. Cute. I'll introduce you to our dog first. His name is Toramaru. How do you do, Toramaru. This is Nana. Who are you? Get out! What the hell? Mess with Satoru and you'll have to deal with me! Step outside. No, I'm coming out! Go home! Let me out, Satoru! I need to teach this dog some manners! It's OK. Don't get mad. Tora! Come on, Tora. What's going on? Miyawaki. Hi, Chikako. Are you OK? We just took Toramaru by surprise. Sorry, he usually doesn't bark like this. Don't worry. Can we come in? Nana is quick to fight. He's all riled up. I'll scold Tora later. Go inside. Right. Welcome to our B&B. Is this your stuff? - I'll bring it in. - Thanks. Put your bags down and come have some tea. OK. Nana. Sorry Toramaru scared you. I hope you like it here. Thanks, Chikako. We'll be right there. Hmm. I see. You should've let me out earlier. I would've taught that dog a lesson. I heard about you from Chikako. You're Momo. I'm Satoru Miyawaki. That's Nana. Hope you get along. Hello. Your owner is very polite. But in comparison, your dog is a barbarian. He barked at Satoru when he was only saying hello. You and Momo will get along. Hello. Welcome to our B&B. Hello. Hello. I'll show you to your room upstairs. I'm glad your business is thriving. I saw it featured in a magazine. We targeted guests with cats as well as dogs. Guests with cats. Was that your idea? Can you tell? As a fellow cat-lover, yes. What are you talking about? Your successful business. How's it going with you? Your company is undergoing a major restructuring, right? I heard it on the news. Is that why you can't keep Nana? For various reasons. I'm lucky you could take him. He's a very dear cat to me. I can't give him to just anybody. I trust you both. I want to tell you up front that we consider this temporary. We'll take good care of him, but come back for him as soon as you can. Thanks. I owe you big time! Count on me! You're the best! Let me help. - No, it's okay. - No, really. What? Hurry up! Wait. I can't believe it. I go out of my way to give you my lecture notes, and you oversleep? I said I'm sorry! What is it? You'll make me late for the test now! Isn't that Miyawaki from our class? What's he doing in the river? What are you doing? The dog fell in. He can't get across! It's OK. Come here. We're going to miss the test! We can't just leave him. You go ahead. Wait! Come here. I'll help you. You approach him from that side. Wait, I'll go. Shu-chan! There! Get him! Cover him with this! Don't worry. You're OK now. Thanks. Thank goodness! I'm not saying you're lying. But was it worth missing the test? School should be your first priority. But we couldn't abandon him... It's just a dog. It's going to the pound, anyway. I'm adopting him. Don't make any rash decisions. I said I'm going to adopt him. If a rash decision will save his life, I'm happy to do it. I'd never take a dog to the pound just because it's convenient. It's just a dog? It's just a test. A test can be retaken any day. We're sorry. - Retake the test. - Yes, sir. Let's go home. You'll be fine. You'll have lots of friends at home. Is she always like that? She's always been a champion of animals. Shu-chan? Are you childhood friends? Hey! I told her not to call me that. Why? She's cute and brave. Cute? Really? Yeah. Will that dog really be OK? Sure. Her whole family loves animals. They have 5 or 6 dogs and cats. Cats, too? Chikako's more of a cat-lover. I'd like to see them sometime. I'm a cat-lover, too. Part-time job? It's against school rules. I know, but I can't ask my aunt for an allowance. I want to go to Takamatsu this summer. Takamatsu? What for? To go see a cat. - A cat? - Yeah. A cat I used to own. Thanks for working part-time with me. That's OK. But are you sure Chikako didn't sucker you into this? Working on her family's tea farm isn't against school rules. She just needed help with her chores. Why are you so harsh when it comes to her? She's a good girl. Cute, too. You're too nice. Don't tell her or she'll get big-headed. Working hard? You were probably talking about me. Calling me a slave driver. Bingo. How'd you guess? I knew it! - This guy... - Sugi... Whichever. Hey! Help us carry this. OK! Miyawaki's a good guy. I wonder if he likes someone. OK, back to work. Get to it. - 'Morning. - 'Morning. You're up early. It's summer break. I'm meeting a friend. Sorry I'm so busy. I can't spend time with you this summer either. No worries. I'm in high school already. I guess it's too late now. Do you have enough money? Tell me if you need more. - I'm going. - See you. Hello? Yes. I'm sorry I'm late. You look pale. Are you OK? Don't push it. I know you want to get to Takamatsu, but... Did something happen to your cat? I got a call this morning. He was hit by a car. You loved that cat. He was family. I had him when my parents were alive. His name was Hachi. Hachi. Such a sweet cat. Zoom, zoom! Hachi! Hachi! Whenever we fought, he'd be there to comfort whoever was losing. He was always...always... What about the job? You gonna quit? I don't need to go to Takamatsu now. You should go. Make enough money to go and say your last goodbyes. You have to mourn the loss of your cat. Don't blame yourself. Go give him a proper mourning. Tell him you tried to get there, but you couldn't. You have to give him closure so he can rest in peace. So let's eat this melon and get back to work. Come on, eat. Good night. Good night. Miyawaki. I'm expecting a souvenir. A souvenir. Yes, ma'am! - See you. - Bye. Wait for me! Wait up, Sugi. - Coming? - To lunch? OK. You're going? - Wanna come? - No thanks. Why not? Here Sugi. A souvenir. Udon noodles! Looks good. Thanks. What about me? - Yours is right here. - What is it? From Yojiya! What else? A mirror! Cute! I love this color! - Chikako! - Coming. - Thanks, Miyawaki. See ya. - See ya. What'd you get? Yojiya? You went to Kyoto? I went once on a school field trip but left midway when my parents died. So I went back. What'd you get? How cute! Isn't it adorable? - Isn't Yojiya famous? - It is! My dad was right. What? He said that facial blotter from Yojiya was the best souvenir for my mom. That she'd love it. She would've been excited. Just like her. Thanks. - What? - Nothing. I swear, it's nothing. What should we eat? For lunch. Rice omelet? I feel like curry. Rice omelet sounds good, too. ''Restaurant Minato'' Thank you. Hey. I went to see a movie while you were in Takamatsu. With Chikako. Because if you were here, she'd want to invite you, too. So I asked her when you were gone. I... ...love Chikako. Since we were kids. I know. Anyone who knew her that long is bound to fall in love with her. I'd better go pay. For two. That was good. Thank you. Please don't tell Chikako. If you do, she'll probably... We're talking theoretically, right? Don't worry so much! I'm going to transfer schools soon anyway. My aunt moves a lot for work. Relationships are hard when you know it's going to be long distance. Let's go. Thank you. Come back again. That watermelon was good. See you tomorrow. Bye! Why are you such a good guy, despite your bad luck? I'm neither a good guy nor unlucky. That's a faulty premise. I'm going to take a bath. Wait. Booze. We've had enough. Let's go to bed. I need more booze. Come on. Let's go to bed. Wait a minute. Why? Wait. Why should I go to bed with you? If you're going to drink 'til you drop, you might as well collapse in bed. What a sloppy drunk. I thought they were friends, but I'm not sure Sugi likes Satoru. Chikako liked your owner once upon a time. Really? That's what my owner thinks, anyway. I see! That dog is Sugi's dog, right? Now I get it. He's being protective of his master. Toramaru's still young. A bit too straightforward. You know so much about your owner. We've known each other a long time. Almost 15 years. You're lucky you've had so much time together. I suppose. Yes? Thanks. What's the medicine for? The food was so good, I overate. Is Sugi OK? Does he always get that drunk? He's happy because you came. But he really overdid it tonight. He's stone drunk. He's sweet. And a little spineless. And annoying at times. But he's hopeless without me. Sugi's a lucky guy. We have to give Nana and Toramaru a proper introduction tomorrow morning. Yeah, thanks. I'm glad you reached out to us. Good night. Night. Hey, Toramaru! - Hey. - Is he OK? He's super agitated. Go home! If you stay here, you'll just be a constant reminder of Miyawaki! I wouldn't want to stay here with a stupid dog like you anyway! Go home, dammit! I can't let a cat that reminds them of Miyawaki stay here because... Shut up! Not another word or you'll regret it! He smells of despair! I told you to shut up! Nana! I'm really sorry. No, it's my fault. I'm glad Nana didn't get hurt. We really wanted to take Nana. Too bad, Momo. Momo! Never mind. They didn't get along. Shut up, Toramaru! We're seeing them off. Thanks, Toramaru. I was wondering how I'd get back home, but you made it easy. Leave Toramaru to me. I'll talk to him. I'll be going, then. - Thanks. - Sorry. All right, Momo. - Take care. - Thanks. I can tell you now... What? I was in love with you in high school. Did you know? Oh my god, that was ages ago. It's too late now. I know. But maybe I should have let you guys fight over me. - See ya. - Bye. - Take care. - Thanks! Bye. What? What? Nothing. Aunty. I just got onto the ferry from Osaka to Kitakyushu. Really? I'll head home after I visit Mom and Dad's grave. I'll probably reach your house the day after tomorrow. Sorry that Nana's still with me. Don't worry about it. But you changed jobs for Nana. You loved being a judge. I'm tired of moving around. I was planning to join a legal office eventually anyway. A colleague asked me to join him. But never mind about me. Can you drive? You're being a worrywart again. I'm fine. Really? Well, be careful. Thanks. Bye. Look at all the rape blossoms. Nana. The field is full of them. Want to make a stop? It's beautiful! Nana. Look. Look, Nana. Beautiful, huh? Look. Wow, Satoru. It looks as vast as the ocean we just crossed. Shall we go? Nana? Where are you? Come back. Nana. Nana! Nana! Nana! I'm right here. Stupid cat! I'd never find you if I lost you here. Stay by my side. I've always been by your side. I wasn't lost. Don't leave me... I need you by my side. You finally admitted it. I knew how you felt all along. Don't worry. Stop crying. I'll never abandon you, Satoru. You got to the hotel safely. Good. Eat well. Get plenty of rest. I know. I'm going to sleep. Good night. All right. Good night. Induction Ceremony Sorry, Aunty. ''One year ago'' I'm here, Satoru. I brought you some things. Let me know what else you need. Sorry, Aunty. The surgery didn't work. I think I have a year left. Sorry, Aunty. Miyawaki Family Grave Here. Dad, Mom, this is Nana. He looks just like Hachi, right? How do you do. Hachi may have been a good cat, but I'm not so bad, right? Look how pretty, Nana A rainbow. Nana's rainbow. It's beautiful, Satoru. It's a beautiful rainbow. A beautiful rainbow. Nana's rainbow. That rainbow was our rainbow. A farewell gift to mark the end of our trip. Anything in the back? - Yeah, two bags. - Got it. I'm glad you made it. Did you get lost? Your map was perfect. You're so meticulous in that way. Just in that way. That's not what I meant. Don't worry. It's true. It's a nice house. Your room is over there. - I'll make some tea. Go relax. - Thanks. This is your new home, Nana. See? First, I'll conduct my inspection. Noriko. What is it, Aunty? Nana suddenly appeared and... I'll get used to him. Just give me some time. Do you hate cats by chance? No, I'm just not used to them. I was bitten by a cat when I was a child. Keeping Nana was a big deal for you. Thank you. But that's not the reason I didn't adopt Hachi back then. I know. Hachi was loved until the end. He was lucky. But Nana ruined his own chances of finding a new home. Thank you for finding a house so we could keep him. Nana. Nana says thank you. - Touch him. - OK. He's so soft! What a nuisance. Satoru, the car's ready. Thanks. Where's that thing you need to take to your doctor? - In the kitchen? - The kitchen? There's no rush. Here it is. Satoru. Does it hurt? I'm fine. Just take it slow, OK? Whether he smiled, took walks or went to the hospital with Noriko, that smell never left his body. That smell of despair that Toramaru caught on to. Your cooking tastes like my mom's cooking. A little sweet and you use shimeji mushrooms in your chicken stew. Our mom died when we were young. My sister's cooking became Mom's home cooking. Maybe that's why I adapted so quickly to living with you. I'm glad you took me in. I wasn't a very good guardian. Remember what I told you when I first adopted you? Aunty. I'm ready. OK. Sit down, Satoru. What? This is something you'll find out sooner or later. You're not really your mom and dad's child. It's horrible. The case I'm working on right now. I can't believe they're human. How can they do such a thing? They abandoned their baby because he was too much trouble. They stopped feeding him because they didn't want to change his diapers. They shut him up in the closet when he cried from hunger. They threw him in the trash so they wouldn't have to go to the hospital. Why even have a baby? Noriko. What's going to happen to the baby? His parents' relatives refused to take him, so he'll end up in an orphanage. You were very lucky that my sister and her husband adopted you. You were way better off with them. Do you understand? I know it was the truth, but there was no need to tell you at the time. I'm so one-track minded and insensitive sometimes. You're wrong, Aunty. I'm glad you told me. Because you told me then, I was able to realize early on how lucky I was. Until you told me, I never thought for a second that I wasn't their real child. That's how genuine their love was for me. My real parents threw me out in the trash, but another set of parents loved me so much. Isn't that amazing? I know. I was just as happy when you adopted me. But it wasn't easy for you, moving around so much. Every time you made friends, we had to move. I made friends I wouldn't have had otherwise. All of them agreed to take Nana, no questions asked. When push came to shove, so many people were willing to take Nana. I'd say I had a happy life. And even if it didn't work out, you agreed to take him in the end. You adopted me. We spent lots of time talking about my parents. Why wouldn't I be happy? Plus I have Nana now. I can spend my final days with you and Nana. Don't cry. But... Nana. Hey stop crying, you two. Let's eat! Your stew was delicious. Which one should I comfort in this case? You need a companion in the hospital. That will be me, of course. I know, Nana. I wish you could come. You're a good cat, so you'll understand, right? Have I ever been anything but good? Hey! Wait, stupid! Stop joking around! You'll be a good cat, right? Shut up! Good is for the dogs. I'll never forgive you if you leave me! Be good, you stupid cat! Who's calling who stupid? Take me with you! I don't want to leave you. I love you, you idiot! I love you, too, you idiot! Come back! Come back! Come back! I want to be your cat until the end! I want to be with you, Satoru! Come back! Don't go, Satoru! Satoru! Don't go! Satoru. Don't go, Satoru... Come back! Satoru! Satoru! Satoru! Don't go, Satoru! Come back, Satoru! I'm going to make my rounds. Thank you. Your daughter was here. Yes. I'm home, Nana. Nana? Nana. Nana. The doctor said you can see Satoru. Not indoors, but in the garden. Way to go, Noriko! Yes! We did it, Nana. You can see Satoru. Look. Satoru! Nana! Go to him. Satoru! You came! I missed you, Satoru! You smell good. You smell like the sun. The sun and I are friends. Smell me all you want. I've missed you so much. Nana... Wasn't it nice to see Satoru, Nana? Nana, no! Nana! Nana, wait! Nana! Nana... Nana...? See ya, Noriko. Bye! Now I can see Satoru whenever I want. I was a stray once upon a time, but it's not easy going back. But I can do it. I'll be Satoru's cat to the end. Mr. Miyawaki, it's a nice day today. Shall we go to the beach? That sounds good. Yes? OK. Noriko's here. I'll go see. Will you be OK? Nana! I know. I won't chase you. Fine, then. Nana, you're such an idiot. That's not very nice. Will you come back to see me, Nana? I'm your one and only cat. We need to stick together until the end, right? Satoru! Nana! Sorry. Aunty, I have a favor to ask you. Can you bring Nana's favorite chicken breast treats? I'm sure Nana is going to come and visit me again. Good boy. You understand. Mr. Miyawaki? Did you take your medicine? Um... Want to go to the beach? It's getting a bit windy. I'm here, Satoru. ''Chicken Breast'' You know, this reminds me of those days. When you used to feed me by that silver car? I'll tell you now that I liked you from way back then. These hands rescued me. They loved me. The ocean looks beautiful. It sure does. Mr. Miyawaki. It's time. Nana. I'm glad you were my last cat. I knew that already. Satoru. Satoru. Satoru. Satoru. Satoru? Nana. Nana... Nana! Bad boy, Nana! Let me see your face. Look how pretty, Nana. A rainbow. Nana's rainbow. Asahigaoka Medical Center Satoru! Satoru! Satoru. If there's anyone you'd like to call, you should do so. Um... The cat. Can I bring Satoru's cat? Don't ask me that! If you ask me, then I'd have to say, No! It's almost time. Mr. Miyawaki. Nana! Satoru, it's Nana! Satoru? Th... an... k... you... No heartbeat. No light reflex. Time of death is 22:12. I'm sorry. Thank you. Cats aren't allowed. Please take him out. Nana. Can I believe that Satoru lived a happy life? What a silly question, Noriko. ''One year later'' Thank you for coming today. Give your daughter my regards. Excuse me. It's a pet friendly B&B. A great place. You should come. - Can cats come, too? - Of course. We have a cat. Want to see? Look. Isn't he cute? He even won my dad over. He hates cats. The power of cats. Even people who don't like them fall in love with them eventually. Aunty, do you want a kitten? Our cat had kittens. We're looking for homes for them. You can have a trial run. I'll bring one over. I'd be honored if Satoru's aunt adopted one. Well... We'll take one, too. We'd love to adopt a kitten from Miyawaki's friend. - Really? - Sure. Right? What was Miyawaki like in grade school? I'm curious, too. He was an airhead. - An airhead? - He was so mature in high school. Satoru. Everyone's talking about you. I hear that fool Kosuke talking. I hear Chikako and Sugi, too. And another unfamiliar voice. But I can tell they love you. Noriko looks happy, too. Hey, Satoru. The people you love are connected, even if you're not here. They're talking about you with fond memories. Can you hear them talking? Do you have rainbows like the one we saw where you are now? Wait for me a little while. We'll all be there someday. Until then, I'll continue my travels. And have lots of stories to tell you.
