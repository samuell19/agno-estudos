--== McEphie ==-- I'll go ahead. Okay. Auntie Cory, what are you doing? Today is your last day and you're still working. Hilda, I'm paid until today so I have to do my job. That's why I look up to you, you're a model employee. You know, if there's an award for that, you'd probably be in the hall of fame! You know, on the wall. Don't change the subject, the pancit malabon that Merly got for you is already here. -Let's go, I'm hungry. -Wait. What's wrong with this machine? Aside from being noisy, it's slow. Auntie, haven't you gotten used to the outdated things in this office? If I know, I'm sure you're going to miss that antiquated printer. -Come on, let's eat. -Let's go. You know, you guys... -Wow, you prepared so much food. -Why not, Auntie Cory? You didn't have to bother. What are you saying, Auntie? Let's eat. Get your... Am I going to eat all of this? You all have to eat with me. -Let's eat. -Come on, let's eat. Everyone, let's eat. Wow, it looks delicious. Did you cook this? Actually, we just ordered it, Auntie. -Wait a minute, Thelma, before I forget. -Yes? About that weekly report at the audit, don't forget that that's important or you might get into trouble. -You know what happened last time. -The hanky panky incidents? I'm aware of that, Auntie Cory. And I know, you don't want me to get caught up in their mess. But trust me, I won't forget everything you asked me to do. But in the meantime, since it's your last day, let's party! -Come on. -Yes, let's party! Everyone, come here. Let's eat. Cory, we're going to miss chatting with you. Likewise, I'll miss you too. But there's the telephone, we can chat all night long! Telephone's so dated. You should open a Facebook account so we can chat online. And so that I can tag you in our throwback pictures! -That's right! -I agree! That's a good idea, Cory. It will keep you busy. You'll get to see my OOTD. What's that? -What do those mean? -Throwback pictures meaning old pictures. -OOTD or Outfit Of The Day. -Wow. Okay, I'll open a Facebook account so I won't miss out on our throwback pictures and those OOTDs. But first, here's the ritual for all the retirees. -Thank you. -Here. Game! For Auntie Cory's new life. For the new places you'll discover. For your unlimited soap opera hours. And for your endless quality time with your husband. And of course, for more hours of beauty rest! -Cheers! -Cheers! Thank you. Took a long nap? Got tired of tinkering with stuff. It's so hot. See? I fixed it. Took me a whole day to do that. It would be a waste to throw it away when we can still use it. That's why your shirt's dirty with grease. You didn't even bother to change it. It's all right. I'm going to take a shower anyway. And maybe, I might work on our car tomorrow. I might change its alternator and water pump. Is there hope for that old thing? Wouldn't that going to be a waste of money? Come on, Coring. Don't you believe in my abilities? Look at this electric fan that's on the brink of its death, I fixed it, and now it's working. Then, I can also do that in our car. Remember before, didn't I work at Uncle Gimo's car repair shop before I got a job at the bank. After I've fixed our car, then I can drive you around. If you want, we can go to all the churches you've always wanted to visit. And you want to learn how to drive, right? I can finally teach you. Yes, I've always wanted to, but you never got around to doing it. I was too busy with office work. But now, it's possible. You've got a lot of time on your hands. Wait, isn't it... Isn't it your last day at work? You're retired, right? You're not supposed to frown. You should be happy. Because we'll be together every day. You can take care of me every day. Thank you, Lord. Is your senior citizen card ready? So we can both get a discount. That's worth something. -Here we go. It's about to begin. -Previously on Heaven Has Fallen... Father, I will not let you throw Vanessa's family out! We'll go. We'll go, Emilio. No, how about me? It's the PBA championship now. Maybe, we can switch the channels. If the commercials are on here, we can switch to the basketball channel. And if the commercials are on in the basketball channel, then we can go back to your soap opera. Be quiet. Wait a minute, I'm waiting for what's going to happen. Don Pancho will throw Vanessa out of the house. But we know she'll come back. Even if she's thrown out of the house, she'll come back. Watch with me. You're leaving? Can't we just leave Vanessa alone? Let her go. Fine, Marco. Continue siding with this woman, you won't get a cent from your father. For the skin that is as white as pearl. Shining like the sun! Beauty that's well taken care of. Sabon, beauty soap! For the unexpected beauty. Meanwhile, partner... Stupid! You let him through. Pass the ball! Give it to Navarro! Give it to Navarro! You fool! It's over. Shit, you can't win this anymore. What? He's free! What happened to Heaven Has Fallen? TO BE CONTINUED... Nothing, it's over. That's why I switched it. Why were you up so early? Why did you wake up early? Thought you still have work today? You know what I've been thinking? I want us to go on vacation. Where do you want to go? Why don't we go to Bohol? Or Baguio? Or Palawan? Okay. When do you want to go? Next week. Why are you laughing at me? What's so funny about that? Because, Cory, it's obvious that you're getting bored staying in the house. And you find that funny? Forget it. Don't get mad. Don't get mad. That's how it is in the beginning. You're still adjusting. What are we supposed to expect? We're supposed to grow old together in this house. Didn't we promise each other on our wedding day that "till death do us part"? ...go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Thanks be to God. -Cory. -Hey! Didn't know that you're here. How are you? You're so blooming. Pretty as ever. I was going to drop by your house to give you some plants. They're called succulents. They're so pretty especially if you put them indoors. I'll give you some. You know that I have no green thumb. They'll just whither. Andong's the one who tends to the garden. Just try it. I'll give you some. Gardening's a nice way to pass time. Whenever I have no one to talk to, I turn to my plants. Maria? Isn't that... Oh, my! Third is back! Isn't he your first love? -Let's go! -Be quiet. Andong might hear you. He's handsome. Let's go to him. He might not recognize us. That's impossible. It's you we're talking about. Come on. I'm going home. I need to cook, okay? I'll wait for those plants, all right? -It won't take a minute. -Forget it. You're such a killjoy. No, I'm telling you, that's fine. Go, approach her, she's staring at you. Today's so tiring, right? Cory, Third has been staring at you. Why are your cheeks getting red? -She's giddy! -Stop... Shut up, both of you. He might think we're talking about him. You know what, you look perfect together. Really? You think so? Of course, you'd look great together. Just imagine. Corps commander and campus star dancer. Perfect combination, isn't it? -Quiet. -Look at him, look at him. Stop! He's here, he's here. What do you mean he's here? Don't mind my silly friends. Are you okay, Cory? Did I hurt you? I'm okay. I'm good. Cory, has someone already asked you to be his partner for the prom. Not yet. Look at her playing hard to get. Because I was wondering if... I was just wondering if, if I can be your date to the prom? And that is if that's okay with you? I'm not sure yet if I'm going to the prom. Is that so? If that's the case... No problem, Cory. I understand. But... I'll just wait for your answer. I'll go ahead. Cory... Cory. I'll go ahead. Oh, my gosh, Cory! What happened? Why did you refuse? The chicken already went near the rice hulls. Isn't the chicken supposed to eat the rice hulls? But where can you find a rice hull that jumped away from the chicken? Nita has a point, Cory. I panicked. I was shocked! Look, my heart's still beating so fast. I didn't even know what to say. A simple yes would do. That's only three letters, Cory. Y-E-S. -Yes! -Third! I'm saying yes. One. Two. Three. You're fooling me. I'm not fooling you, Cory. I can never do that to you. You're the flower of my life. You're that beautiful to me. Did you like it? Where are you going? Cory! Andong. Come, let's go to sleep. Good morning, my beloved Philippines. Let's continue our joyous conversations... Hi, Granny. Auntie. Oh, you're here. My hand is wet. Bless me, Grandma. -How have you been? -I'm good. Here, Auntie, I brought you some empanada. I baked these myself. Have Uncle Andong eat some. Looks like you have a new pastime and it looks yummy. -Of course. -You already know how to bake. Grandma, it's because Dad's new girl is a good cook. Shut up, Ton-ton. It's true. You wouldn't want to lose to foxy lady. Right, Ma? Don't ruin my day, Ton-ton. -Go to the other room. -But I want to eat first. Not now, this is for your grandma. Go. For grandma only? You're always making me starve. This boy is impossible. Come on, leave us. Okay, tell me, until when will you let that suffering go on? Auntie, Ton-ton was just kidding. Randy has changed. Auntie, do you have all the requirements for your life plan? I need them so I can process the lump sum that you want. Okay. But I'm having second thoughts. I'd rather have a monthly pension. That seems a good option for you. What will you do with the lump sum, anyway? I want to start a business. But, of course, I don't want a small one. That's why I want to get the whole amount. Auntie, you really have to think about it. That might be too hard for you. You can't start a business if you're not completely sure about it. Okay, I'll think about it. We have a memorial plan promo at Forever Life. Do you want to get one? What's with you? I only retired. I'm not yet dying. I'm not saying that you're dying. It's just that, I want you and Uncle Alejandro to have a secured future. And Auntie, who's taking care of you here? Only me. And I can't be here every day. Let's talk about it next time. I have to do something. Arni, please try to understand your Auntie. She's irritable these days. She's just getting old. Oh, why is this boy not stopping poking that thing. Grandma, how come we're not yet friends in here? What "friends?" I don't know what that is. You don't have this yet? You don't have an account here? I'll teach you how to open one. Isn't that for young people only? No, a lot of oldies are members here, too. -Come on, where's your laptop? -Over there. -Come on. -That's hard. Let's go so that you can stop cleaning the house every day. We'll make you an account. There. Write your first name. Corazon. There. And then, you can put your picture here. You can put any picture you like. You can even choose one from your younger days. -It has to be a beautiful one. -Of course. Then, you're going to look for your friends. Who do you want to find? The ones I know like my classmates. Like Maria. Who else? Hey, that's my officemate. -Click this. There. -Like this? You can like their pictures. There, there. More friends are appearing. They're my officemates. -I want to like their pictures. I want... -Okay. Just click it. There. I'm tired. Coring! Coring, it's time to prepare our dinner. Maria. We have a reunion. Third is inviting us. Yes, we'll all see each other. It's funny, he didn't know that Nita has died. He's here to process his property documents in Davao so he can't stay long. Wait. Wait a minute. Where will it be? And when? Next week at his old house in A. Luna. And he asked to tell everyone to bring our husbands or whoever we want to take with us. Who will I take? Gerardo's gone. I'll look for one around the neighborhood. Wait. I'll talk to Alejandro first and check if he'll agree for us to go. You know him, he doesn't like going out. Then force him. You have to be there, okay? All right. Okay, thank you. The time now in the Philippines is 7:00 p.m. You take care of it, okay? Has he called yet? Cory, why are you so restless? You're like a mosquito larva that can't stay still. I already told you, he hasn't called yet. Purita, be honest with me. Does my hair look okay? Is my dress pretty? Yes, you look beautiful tonight. So stop fidgeting or you'll wrinkle it. Cory! Dad! -Ouch! -Yes? What happened? What happened here? Sit here. Purita, answer the phone. -Where- does it hurt? -Hello? -Here? Does it hurt here? -Yes? Anybody home? Anybody home? -Third? -Yes, Sir, good evening. Is it him? I'm here to pick up Cory. I'm sorry, lad, but Cory can't go out tonight. May I see him? HERE, GETTING OLDER. ME TOO. BUT I MUST SAY YOU, TOO, YOU'RE STILL HANDSOME. LOL TO YOU TOO. You know, it's really better to have your clothes done by a dressmaker, especially by the daughter of Ms. Chato. Darling, it's a good thing you inherited your mother's talent. -Thank you, Ms. Maria. -It's true. -Ever since we were single, -Yes. We would go to a dressmaker. It's better to go to a dressmaker because the measurement is perfect. -Right. -It's a perfect fit for your body. That's why I don't buy clothes at the mall and they're expensive. Not only that, those clothes quickly go out of style. Unlike our clothes, they are still in style up to now. That's true. Our clothes never go out of style when done by a dressmaker. We're the only ones who do. Just you. But that's true, Cory. Our fine taste in fashion hasn't changed, right? We've been like this since we were young. And this applies not only in clothes. The same goes in our bags, shoes, and hairstyle. And with the men we love, too. But do you remember, when I told you that you and Third should've ended up together. That's the only part where I missed about your preference. But if you're happy with your choice. What's wrong with you, Maria? Up until now, you're still a fan of our love team? Do you still remember those things? It's because you and your first love were such a good match. You should have seen them. Stop that "First love" memories. That's only for the young ones. We're too old for that. Corazon, tell me I'm crazy but love is not measured by how old we are. Love is ageless, Auntie Cory. Correct. Since we're into the topic, there's nothing wrong about it, right? Unless if you put malice into it. I want to know, until now, you still haven't forgotten Third? Come on, Maria. Let's not talk about it. Have you no shame? What's to be ashamed about it? Ever since you had that little accident, when you were supposed to be his date, you didn't even bother to talk to him or call him. You didn't even see him before he left for America. That's what we call, "first love never dies." Why don't you just focus on taking those measurements before you die? You're so funny, my friend. You know, at this point in our lives, we shouldn't talk about what's in the past. No, Cory, at this point in our lives, it's much better to reminisce the past especially if it gives us a little thrill, even for a short while. What's wrong with revisiting and cherishing those memories from the past? -Are you done? Is it my turn? -Yes. I'm next, right? -You can stand here. -Okay, it's the old woman's turn. You know what, before, Chato, your mother, knew the exact measurements of our body. Back when I was slender. Okay, there at the waistline. -It's 38. -Thirty-eight! -You heard that? -You whispered too loudly. I wonder what Third will say when both of you meet. Your waistline's 38. I know what you should say. Tell him you're pregnant and he's the father. What are you talking about? Mom? -Is that Roland? -Mom, let's go. Just when the topic gets interesting. -What now, Cory? -We have to go. -I have to meet someone. -Okay, all right. Are you coming with us or should we go ahead first? We're not yet done. We just started. Can't do anything about this kid. Can you hand me my bag, please? Oh, I can't stretch that much now. I'll go ahead. -We'll have the usual all-in rate, okay? -Yes, Ma'am. -I'll go ahead, my friend. Bye. -Okay, take care. I swear Roland has the worst timing. Why are you in such a hurry? I have an important meeting. Just when I'm starting to have fun with my friends. Cory, are you feeling sick? I'm okay, Auntie. How come you look like you have an upset stomach? I'm just shy. I don't know anyone here. Get over that shyness. That's why you haven't had a boyfriend. It won't take much to talk to the people here. There's nothing wrong with that. You're old enough. Auntie, go to your friends. I'm okay here. What I'm trying to tell you is to learn from my experience, for time has passed me by. It's a good thing I found a boyfriend at my age. I'm surprised that it's still possible to love and be in love at my age. Don't wait till you're 50 years old before you look for a boyfriend. And we already agreed that I'll introduce you to Alejandro, Peping's nephew. Not now, Auntie. Forget about our deal. No way! I already told you, Alejandro's a good man, and has a decent job. And looks like he's going to be an old bachelor. You'd make a good match. Here's Alejandro. Come. -How are you, Alejandro? -Good evening, Ma'am. I'm good. -Come and sit down. -Thank you. -Did you see my Uncle Peping? -Not yet. I'll go look for him but this is my niece, Cory. Cory, this is Alejandro, Peping's nephew. Don't be shy and talk to each other. I'll go look for Peping. I'll ask him to join us. Go, talk to each other. Go. Here, I cooked breakfast for you. Just get a spoon. I'll just go to the plaza. Let's go. We're already dressed. What's wrong? We're already late. It will be easy. Hurry, leave those. No one will steal that. Let's go to our positions. -Don't push me. -Let's go to our positions. Energy, give me some energy. Keep the energy going! You can do it. There. There, do it properly. -Wave your body, yes! -Push it! Wave your body! It's painful on the knees. Wave your body, then hips, and wave your body. Keep going. Bend down! -My back, it hurts. -That's just in the beginning. Let's keep going, we're going to keep going. And another set, another set. -Look at my sweat! -Yeah, it's running down up to here. You know, I haven't perspired like this. It feels good. -Did you enjoy yourself? -What? Yes. We'll see how my body will feel tonight. So we will do this regularly? -Yes, I think so. -I think I lost 1000 calories. That's too much! Maybe 400. I sweat buckets! It feels good to do aerobics. Now I'm starving. Actually, it does make you hungry. You have to watch what you eat or our exercise will be for nothing. Boys don't like heavyweight women. They might mistake us for boxing partners. They're looking for women with toned muscles, slim, so they can be good sparring partners in bed. You're all cougars. -Hi, Auntie. -Hi. -Did you join just now? -Yes, first time. It was only recently that I've had time for this. -Yes, it's fun. -We really enjoy it. You're a fun bunch. This is my BFF Cory. -See, I know what BFF means. -Trying to sound young. I'm Maria. -Hello! -Hello! I'm Ana. This is Linda, Cuncha, -and Madam Fely. -Hi. Hello. You know, I really enjoyed our aerobics and meeting you all. You're so fun to be with. I enjoy hanging out with you. It's really fun exercising here, even if it's exhausting, it keeps us youthful. Why is that, Madam Fely? Only men grow older, while women are forever young. Ana's forever young. She looks for forever young boys. I'm what you call a cougar. Stop with the gossip. Cory, young men go after me but I don't go for them. But it's okay to have a ten or fifteen-year gap in a relationship -compared with Beverly. -Who? She has a boyfriend who's half her age. I heard she pays for his schooling. Yes, the boy's going to be a seaman. Leave Beverly alone. She says she's "still sour." What the... And you, are you still sour? You look like you're "still sour" too, right, Cory? My sweat is as sour as vinegar. Coring? Coring. Coring! What? Why do you keep on asking for me? Why are you so grumpy? Because I'm busy doing something. How would you feel if I'd bother you, too? You know, Corazon, I've noticed that ever since your retirement, you've been cranky. You always avoid me. I just want to ask for a glass of water. Here. What's with you, Corazon? Why are you always getting mad? It's because you're picking on me. I'm doing something. I'm busy. I'm not used to being stuck like this. I prefer to keep myself busy. I feel useless. I feel like I'm a prisoner here. Do I make you feel that way? I don't know. Maybe you shouldn't have retired yet. So that you won't be cranky here. -Come in. -It's so hot. -Hi, Auntie! Hello. -What brings you here? Come here, child. Ton-ton and I were in the neighborhood. Just wanted to ask if you're interested in that location by the highway. Ask your Auntie. She's going to decide on that. Auntie, have you decided on it? Someone might beat you to it. It's a good location. Yes, I'll take it. It will keep me busy. That's what I like about you. What do you plan to do with it? Open a grocery store? Yes, a grocery store. But you have to help me with getting suppliers, okay? Yes, Auntie. But Uncle, Auntie, you have to be careful with your customers, okay? Don't allow them to buy on credit. They might not pay you. So, do we give a reservation fee? So you can start with your business. Yes. Tell you what, come back in two weeks. I'll give you the money for the taxes for our property in Cavite as well. When is it due? -Wait, I'll get the documents. -Okay, Uncle. Wait! That's not it. Let go. Here's the deed. See, you crumpled it. Corazon! -Corazon! -Yes? Can you explain what to do with this? Grandpa, can you still fix that? It's vintage. You can sell it to an antique shop. It's still going to run. Believe me. Why do you insist on working on this? Grandpa, it's better if you buy a used car. I can help you browse through Buy and Sell. I can still repair this I can still fix this. You know, Ton, if a thing can still be fixed, then it can be saved. It takes perseverance. You have to persevere. Hand me the pliers. Then, you can give this to me. Since Dad can't afford to give me one. You're something. If you want to get a headache, then I'll bequeath this to you. I think this can still work. I want to help you but all I know are computers. How do we do this? Auntie. Auntie, may I loan some money? I have to pay for Ton-ton's tuition. Why don't you ask your husband? Randy just got a new job. He can't ask for an advance payment. And he can't get a loan yet. I knew it. What you mean is, you can't count on him. Look at you. You work like a dog. He has left you so many times, and you still haven't learned anything? You make yourself look stupid. He cheats on you over and over, yet you keep on welcoming him back. Auntie, don't get mad at Randy. He promised. And I can see that he's changing. He got himself a new job. And Auntie, you know, I love Randy. Maybe that's how it is. Once you get married, you carry a cross for life. All right, Auntie, Ton-ton and I have to go. Wait. How much do you need? Five thousand pesos. If not for your son, I wouldn't do this. Thank you, Auntie. That's why I really love you. I knew you'd lend me money. I now have the money to pay for Ton-ton's tuition, Auntie. Thank you, Auntie. I love you. Why did you put the call down? Mark, stop! Who keeps on calling you? I don't know. There's no one on the other end of the line. Then forget about it. Let's watch. Corazon? Coring? Cory, my BFF. Anybody home? -Hey, beautiful. -Hi, Maria! Come here, take a seat. -I will. -Wait there. -I'll get you something to drink. -Thank you. You didn't have to. -The weather's pretty hot these days. -Thank you. What brings you here? Oh, my. Cory, my dear, you'll be so happy with your dress. -I'm sure it's going to look good on you. -Really? Yes, but you didn't get to wear it because you didn't go to the reunion. I don't know. I kept on calling you but you never picked up. -Our phone's busted. -Then change it. Oh, my god. I don't know. And here. Here are some chocolates from Third. Come on. Don't be so loud. Is this all? Share some with me. The truth is, I didn't go because I didn't want to make a mess. Alejandro saw my letters for Third. What? He'll definitely get mad. Or maybe not, but I know... he saw Third's name on it. Oh, lord, how can you be stupid? Why do you still keep those letters? Do they still mean anything to you? Tone down your voice. -Yes. -Corazon, throw them away. You've been keeping them for years. Those letters are valuable to me. Because they remind me that there was a guy who loved me. How can you say that? Did you know that I wrote to him every year but I never sent them because I was thinking that nothing would come out of it. So I would write letters and I imagine him writing back to me. Maria, you have no idea how it made me happy. That was the only time when someone showed me that kind of special love. Maybe, that's why I couldn't forget him. But of course, time has passed us by. We've grown old. We think that those feelings won't fade away until I reached the point where I stopped writing because I don't know him anymore. What's the point of writing to someone you no longer recognize. Until recently, I don't know why, but all of a sudden, I felt that all those memories came rushing back at me, the memories of how happy we were, when I saw him at the church. That's impossible. Corazon, don't take this the wrong way but I can't believe that after all these years with Alejandro, you have never felt that he loves you. Maria, sometimes two people are together because they love each other. Sometimes, they're together because there's no one else to be with. And there comes a time they stay together without any fuss for each other. I live to take care of Alejandro. We eat together. We sleep together. Then we wake up and we get busy with our daily lives. We don't make love anymore. We have no children. You're lucky, you have one. When you grow too old to get around, someone will guide and take care of you. While Alejandro and I have no one but each other. But you should feel lucky because your husband is so kind. He's not a drunkard, he doesn't hurt you, and he's hard-working. Alejandro is kind but I haven't felt how it is to be truly happy with him. Now, I've realized how lucky I was with Gerardo... May his soul rest in peace. ...because I married the man I love. But I have to tell you Cory, let's keep this between us, there were days when I felt that our relationship was monotonous. Because of that, I kept asking myself, did I truly love Gerardo? Was I happy with him? I repeatedly asked myself that, Cory. Over and over. Did you find out the answer? Loving a person is like taking care of plants. Every day, you need to water it and take care of it. Every single day, you look for a reason and a way to feel you're still capable to love and you still love the one you chose to be with forever. But don't give all of that love away. You have to keep some for yourself. That's important. This is making me thirsty. This water's not enough. Hello? Who's this? Third. Hold on. Cory? Cory, it's Third. Your classmate. Why didn't you go to our reunion? I wasn't feeling well. Do you know that I am leaving for the States next weekend? I was just wondering if you have time to meet. We're getting old. This might be the last time we could see each other. All right. What can we do for you? I want my hair styled. By the way, just relax first. Hi, Ma'am! What style do you want? Girl, I want a haircut like Rihanna's. Is that okay? -This one? -Yes. -Looks fabulous. Okay, let's do this. -Okay. Madam, what hairstyle do you have in mind? Can I have the same one as Rihanna's? Yes, we can do that. But are you sure about it? -Yes, I'm sure. -If you're sure, then let's do it! What happened? Are you going to attend a party that's why you styled it like that? Why? Is it ugly? Can't I try to look pretty? Alejandro, I think I have the right to make myself look good once in a while. I have no intention to look tired and haggard in this house. Coring, whatever your hairstyle may be, you're still the most beautiful woman for me. Watch it! Look at your hands! They're so dirty, you might soil my dress. You're full of grease. You can wash it off. I don't want grease on my clothes. You know very well why I'm full of grease. I've been repairing our Mercedes Benz, so I can teach you how to drive. All right, you may hug me but only after you've fixed our car. You know, let's leave Cory alone. Looks like she's going to a date. Let's go. I want to show you something. -All right. -Is it okay? You know, we're going to a beautiful place. -Really? -Yes. Cory, wait. -Dude, may I borrow your guitar? -Yes. -Thank you. -No problem. Oh, please don't say goodbye Oh, Sun That's my only plea Because when you're gone We have to bid each other goodbye Bid each other Goodbye And at night I pray To dream Of your face I always long To be with you I plead the depths of the night To hurry and leave For I long To see you again Every afternoon Where are you going? Cory! Got you! Is for you not to leave Not yet, My Sun Not now My Sun... ...is you Corazon! Corazon! Coring! Coring! Hurry! Hurry up. What's with you? Why do you keep bothering me? It's done. It's working. We can drive around. It's fixed? It's running? The engine is running. So, will you teach me how to drive? Sure. -You're wonderful. -Go get dressed. -Hurry. -Okay. Wait for me. Coring, look at this park. It looks like the park that we went to on our first date. It looks like our park. I remember, my wallet got snatched. Instead of eating somewhere fancy, we ended up having cheap ice cream. I know. And can you still remember? It's also on that same place, where a bird pooped on you. Oh, well. I'm sorry, Coring. It took me a while to fix our car. But I did it. Good thing that you did because I've always wanted to learn how to drive. I'm so happy because now, you can teach me. But we can do more than having driving lessons because you now have more time. We can go to the places you've always wanted to go to. Right? We don't have to stick to watching TV all the time. And you won't be grumpy anymore. You have to put it in the first gear and then release the clutch. The brake pedal is in the middle. -And the gas pedal is on the right, okay? -Okay. To start, shift to the first gear and then step on the clutch -before you step on the gas pedal. -Okay. Do that slowly and now, we're going to drive faster so go to the second shift. -Okay. -There. Did you get that? Look out! There's a girl in front of us! Sorry. Are you okay? I'm okay. Thank God, she's fine. You made me nervous. No, I was just showing you how to use the brake. I know, but you still have to watch where you're going. You know that, don't you? Our car has strong brakes. -Second gear... -You almost hit someone... Andong, I'm so happy. We had a such fun adventure. Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it. That's all I want, for you to be always happy. So Cory, if there's anything else that will make you happy, do it. I may not be able you give you everything that can make you happy. We don't have much time left. You know, we're getting old. ...HAS PASSED SINCE OUR LAST MEETING. ...I STILL REMEMBER UP TO THIS DAY ...SOMEDAY I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN Third, don't say that. The same goes for you. Just like the old days. Let's order. What do you want? -I'll have iced tea. -Two, please. You know, our town has changed so much. There are so many coffee shops and the malls are huge. The Philippines has progressed a lot. That's true. So much has changed. Are these your kids? The boy's handsome and the girl's cute. Timmy, the eldest, is a doctor specializing in brain surgery. My daughter, Mary Ann, is a pastry chef. You sound so proud of your children. By the way, how is your wife? I shouldn't have asked about such a sensitive issue. It's okay. No problem. How about you, Cory? How many kids do you have? None. Alejandro and I didn't get to have children. I was kind of hoping for maybe one. You can still have one. Silly. By the way, remember how I used to do this to you? Do you remember this? This... Silly. I know your magic trick. It's corny. I'm going back to America. I was just wondering if, you have time, why don't you visit us in the States. Let's have a tour. It's not that easy to go there, Third. We have to save up for it. Thank you so much for seeing me. Thank you, too because we finally had our first date. Third? What does GTG mean? Got To Go. Let's continue our Internet chats, okay? I talked to the travel agency for our Palawan trip. They'll call back tomorrow. Have you had coffee? Not yet. I've been waiting for you. #THIRDISMYFIRST Subtitle translation by Fiona Borres
