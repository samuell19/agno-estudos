I'd never even heard of AC/DC. And the manager said, "Just stand here. And the band comes on in, like, two minutes." So l stood there and the band comes on... ...and there's this little guy, you know, about that big... ...in a school uniform with a bag on his back... ...going crazy, and l laughed. They must have been on for half an hour. I laughed, and l still laugh. And l think he's great. It mesmerizes me. You know? It's very exciting. Like, l was in a situation once where l had a broken hand. We had to get a replacement for a few weeks. And, uh, for a few nights I sat at the front and watched... ...and l enjoyed it very much. Except for the other guy playing drums, of course. CLIFF: He amazes me. I love to watch him all the time. He amazes me. He's better than Mick Jagger. And Elton John. And Rod Stewart.
