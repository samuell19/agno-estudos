>> Hi, Emily. Didn't need to be like this, did it? [sighs] Emily Gray. First class honors, high school. Graduated, Vancouver. Everything seems to have gone on pretty swimmingly until 1995. Then 1996 comes along and...wow! You tried to drown a little boy in the lake... out of the blue. You served five years for that. You're out for only one, and then this mess. You want to tell me what's going on? I mean, you do, right? That's...why you confessed. I'm all ears, Emily. You got something worth saying, let's hear it. What...the hell...happened? >> What if I told you that I knew the meaning of life? >> [eerie music] >> The thing you have to understand is...either everything has meaning or nothing does. Look around. Life is just an accident, man. Random collision of particles in space. Any meaning it has, is only one we've given it ourselves. Just like a riddle. What do the poor have that the rich want and God fears? Like death or love or God, the answer to the riddle all depends on how you look at things. What the poor have, that the rich want that God fears...simple... >> Nothing. That is so for real. It's...it's like everything is just one big puzzle in your mind. >> Mmhm. >> [doorbell ringing] >> [footsteps] >> And every mind is different. >> [Hard rock'n'roll playing] >> VERN: You were late. >> SARA: I got sidetracked. >> [car doors closing] >> Buildings have alarms but there's no on-site security. >> [click] >> VERN: Go. >> [dramatic rock'n'roll] >> What demands an answer but asks no question? >> [phone ringing] >> [running footsteps] >> MAN: [on phone] Okay, Sara. Are you ready for this? It's in, kind of, a strange place. >> Thanks for the tip, Dad. What's the next clue? >> [on phone] You're holding it. You're one strange puppy. You know that, lady, for using that story. You're the first person I met, into this shit, that's not a kid or a freak like me. >> [on phone] Well, if you want to see the world differently, you have to practice seeing it differently. >> Whatever rows your boat, baby. By the way, you got three minutes to go. >> [coins jangling] >> SARA: "Just keep letters that win this race and find your final resting place." Letters that win this race...first letters... phone number! J, k, l. J, k, l. "That win this race." >> [phone ringing] >> Come on. >> [phone ringing] >> [door rattling] >> Find your final resting place. >> [stopwatch ticking] >> Gotcha. >> [alarm clock bleeping] >> [beeping stops] >> MAN: What is life? Who are we? Why are we? Why do things happen the way they happen? Today in our philosophy discussion we'll be looking at three key figures. Aristotle, Descartes and Nietzsche. Three different men with three very different views of the world. >> Novak! Hey, Novak! I just want to tell you how moved I was by what you said the other day in class. Phew! All that stuff about the nature of reality and everything...it really touched me, you know. And I thought that maybe you and I could go out sometime and discuss it a little more in depth? >> Thanks, Curran, but I think I'll pass. >> Ooh...I'm serious. You know Marie, right? We've got this little study group going and we both very much value your input. But, I have to say that it's not so much a...metaphysical thing as it were. It's really more a hands on, you know? So how about it? Would you be interested in a group learning experience? >> Oh, come on! It was just a question. >> Curran, have you ever stopped to wonder why none of the little games you play ever work or do you just figure it's a hygiene problem? >> Hey, I'm only responding to all your dirty little signals, honeysuckle. >> [laughs] Well, re-adjust you radar, Romeo. >> Okay, so maybe I got you all wrong. But at least I'm not the one lugging some big dark secret around with me all the time. Hmm? You got a secret, Novak. The whole school practically knows it. >> Hmm. Let me guess...I'm a closet nymphomaniac? >> Oh...ah! Twice a week you drive a car to school but then take the subway home at night...and then back the next morning. So that means you must be going somewhere you don't want your car to be seen--right? I guess, uh, little miss angel isn't such an angel after all. So come on, tell me, where do you go when you catch the train? >> [train rumbling] >> [crowd murmuring] >> [crowd murmuring] >> MAN: All right, people. As most of you know the lousy bastards that pay our minimum wage have sprung for the proceedings this evening--their way of saying thanks for doing a good job. Lads, keep fooling them. >> [applause] >> JEFF: Go ahead and open it. >> Did you manage to fit an entire security system in here this time or maybe just a shotgun? >> Look and see. >> You know I took the revolver back. There's no way I'd ever use that thing. >> It's your birthday. Will you get on with it? >> [laughs] Dad! It's beautiful. >> [laughs] As a police officer I can tell you mace is effective up to six feet away. How the hell's my girl doing anyway? Are you doing okay? >> The usual I guess. Studying a lot. >> Are you going out, seeing people? >> Mmhm hmm. >> You know, Sara, when all your friends went away to University and you decided to enroll here I thought, well, maybe it was for the best. After all you've been through it will give you some continuity and your grades start to slip and I thought, well, it's natural. But to just sit at home and watch the world slip by... >> Dad... >> You have got so much... >> A man is running late for work one day. In his rush he forgets to grab his umbrella and his raincoat but he still manages not to get wet. How? Because it never rained. >> Ah. I'm assuming you have a point. >> You always want me to be so prepared against failure, burglary. You have to let me live my life though, find my own answers. >> So, while you're looking you can come over tomorrow night and see me and Lea... >> [laughs] >> We could go to the movies... >> Get real cozy and play happy family? Thanks, but I'll pass. >> JEFF: Sara... >> I don't need a replacement caregiver, Dad. You married her. Not me. I've got an early start tomorrow. I should just go. >> Sara...your real present. >> Is this mom's? >> Yeah. It's good to look for answers. Sometimes, if you look too hard, you lose the ones you already have. >> I'm okay. >> PROFESSOR: The curse of human consciousness is that it longs to know only that which is unknowable. For all our philosophizing, can the meaning of life ever truly be understood? With exams only two weeks away, let us hope, for your sakes, that at least some of it can. >> [sighs] >> Look, Curran, it's not going to happen, okay? Not here, not on a plane, not in a train. >> [laughs] I have my secrets, too. [laughing] >> You ever hear stories on TV sometimes that don't make any sense? Maybe a train derails for no reason or an unexplained fire breaks out somewhere, you know, a mystery. A few years ago police found out about this invitation that's been sent around. Some people got it in their mail or on their computer, even painted on the side of their house. The invitation was a riddle. >> What do you mean? >> All I know is the answer led you to an abandoned building somewhere in the City. If you could work out where it was, then you became part of a game and the rules were simple. You begin receiving riddles--anonymous ones. Once you solve them, all you had to do was return to the building and write the answer on the wall. If you get a certain number of them right, then one day you'd be shown "the design." It's this idea riddle freaks are into, you know, that all those unexplainable events out there that no one can make any sense out of, they're all just part of one big riddle we don't understand. Well, according to the game, if you played long enough, one day you get a chance to see the answer to that riddle. This was the calling card of the game. Want to tell me where you got it from? You really don't want to get involved. >> Uh, just a friend. It was a joke. >> Funny kind of joke. >> Yeah, funny kind of guy, believe me. So, what happened? You said the cops found out about it? >> Yeah. That woman a few years ago tried drowning that boy in the lake--it was all over the news. >> Emily Gray? >> Yeah. When the cops questioned her about it, all she would say was that it was part of "the design." >> You're joking me? >> No. Your friend's joking, remember? I'm just hitting on you. >> When 34-year-old Emily Gray attempted to drown her neighbor's child in the city harbor last year, all of Toronto was left in a state of shock. Tonight, in an exclusive interview, we get a chance to speak with Emily for the first time. >> [fast-forward audio] >> WOMAN: He was just a little boy, Dennis Reveni, 12-years-old. Why did you try to kill him? >> Cyclone hits a tropical island, kills 45 people. Train derails in Colombia. The brakes fail on a school bus in Calgary. Why? What reasons are there for anything? >> WOMAN: Near your house, police found an abandoned building with words spray painted all over the walls. Did you try to murder this boy as...part of some game? >> It was all part of the design. When he looks in the mirror, he knows... I never sinned. >> [sirens wailing] >> [fast footsteps] >> [train rumbling] >> When it's ajar. >> [train rumbling] >> "What has keys but no lock...space but no room. You can enter but never go in." >> [static] >> You can enter, but never go in... A keyboard. >> [bleep] >> [thud] >> Hello? >> [thudding] >> Hello? >> [train rumbling] >> [frantic music] >> [police radios] >> Sara! I just heard! What the hell is going on? Someone chased you? >> It was the cleaner. He thought I was stealing and I thought...I overreacted. >> Novak! I think we found what scared you, ma'am. It was in the computer. Source of the images. >> Images? >> It's nothing. A practical joke. [laughs] >> Sara, was this harassment? >> Dad. >> I think we should file a report, huh? >> Dad, listen! I am fine. Really. >> At least let me give you a ride home. >> Oh, God. >> Are you all right, dear? >> I, um... I have a study thing. I forgot. >> Now? >> Yeah, in the library. I've got to go, okay? >> Oh, Sara. >> I will call you. >> Sara! Sara! >> [rustling] >> [rock'n'roll playing] >> Excuse me? >> Sara. Curran's friend, right? >> Yeah. Do you know where he is? I need to talk to him. >> So, the rumors are true I take it? You're going through a younger guy thing. I've been there. >> Look, I don't know what you've heard. I just need to ask Curran a question. >> Well, then... He was at the Chez "M." My work. Curran dropped by last night. I haven't seen him since. You know, now you're trying a few new things out, maybe you could, uh, drop by too sometime. I could show you a few tricks. We've all got our secrets, honey. >> [elevator whirring] >> SARA: Why did you give this to me, Curran? >> [tires screech] >> [tires screech] >> If you saw me, then I saw you. Okay, Curran. What's your game? >> [hip-hop music playing] >> [hard rock'n'roll playing] >> Say, Vern, I was just thinking about that stuff we were talking about the other day, you know, life and stuff. >> Yeah, well, uh, meaning is what you make it. It's all in your head. >> I know. I know and that is why I've come up with another one. You know, a riddle that has meaning if you look at it just the right way. >> All right. Go. >> What's a ghost's favorite color? Boo! Yeah. >> Oh. >> No, I...I know! I know! But think about it. Okay, think about because if that's true, then what would be a ghost's favorite thing to wear? Boo jeans, dude! [laugh] I know! That's pretty for real. >> Yeah. Look, um, I've gotta grab some stuff from the back. >> I'm glad he got that on tape. >> "Ancient riddles." "Riddles of the night. Riddles for the spider." >> [beep] What has rivers but no water," forests but no trees, cities but no buildings?" Fine! >> [train rumbling] >> A map...a map. >> [bleeping] >> "Find Romeo's girl...and the word of fear will then be here. >> Curran? Curran? Okay, so you know where I go when I catch the train. What do you want? It's just a game. No big deal. >> [bang] >> Curran? Curran? Curran? >> [gasping] >> Sara? >> [gasping] >> Sara, what are you doing here? Oh, fuck! Sara, come on. Sara, no! Sara, stop! >> The police... we have to call them! >> No! We can't call the police. >> He's dead, Vern! >> Sara! Sara! You were playing the game. That's what you were doing here, right? And we can't go to the cops. >> We have to. >> Someone is setting us up for this. Do you understand? Do you understand? Now, get in the truck. Go home. We'll meet tomorrow. Go home. >> [open door] >> Go home. >> [alarm clock beeping] >> [birds chirping] >> A man lies dead in the middle of the desert. All he has with him is an unopened package. The unopened package explains his death. What's in the package? >> LEA: What are you mumbling about in here? >> Nine across. Unopened package explains the man's death...bing! Parachute! >> Oh! I gotta get to work. >> Oh, honey, do me a favor, would you, hmm? Some of Sara's mail came here. I thought if you return them to her, it might be a nice excuse to pop in and say hi. >> You never give up, do you? >> Hmm? >> Oh, for God's sakes, Jeff. She treats me like a rash. >> Oh, that's not true, Lea. >> Isn't it? >> [doorbell ringing] >> Tom? >> Sorry to bother you, boss. There's been a situation. >> You lied. >> I've never seen that before. >> You were playing the game, Sara. Don't you think that's close enough? Yesterday someone left a nice little message for me on one of my windows. At the other end of it all was you...and a corpse. Now I might be a little slow here but what the fuck is going on? >> About six months ago my car wouldn't start. I was running late so I caught the subway. It was just like you said, Vern. Written by the tracks, this riddle. I didn't know what it was. I thought maybe it was for me. So I answered it. The answer led me to the abandoned building. When I got there the rest of the game was spray painted on the floor. They were easy. Write your answer to the subway riddle on the wall of the building. That was it. Then one day, maybe after one riddle--or a hundred--you'd finally get to see it. The reason behind everything we don't understand, you would understand somehow. So, I did it. I went back to the subway and they were there and... >> ...you answered them. And you had no idea who they were from. Real good, Sara. That's real good. >> I didn't think anything would happen. What do we do now? >> We? Look, I take full responsibility for this, okay? Really. I mean, this whole time I was thinking you were just this chick into her intellectual thing, but, you know, normal. Turns out you're a psycho. Oh, spare me the Miss NaÃ¯ve act. I saw that body, too, remember? >> What? You think I did it? I found him like that! >> Oh, yeah, out of the blue, there he was. >> I was playing...the game. I was... >> ...answering riddles in the subway. Crawling around in the dark, you said. What you didn't say was why. Come on, Sara. Good-looking educated girl like you. I bet the boys are lining up a mile long for their piece of white bread. But you decided to come down here instead. Slum it with the likes of me. Play your little mind games. Well, something doesn't smell quite right. Why are you doing this? Why are you playing this thing? Why are you playing the game? >> I was in a car crash, okay? My mother was driving. It killed her. I was thrown clear. There is a reason? A design? I guess I just wanted to know what it was. >> Sara, it's just a game. It's not real. >> What is a game, Vern? Something where you have to give the pieces back once your time's up. Well, guess what? It means it's all a game. Life, everything, one big game. >> [doorbell rings] >> [footsteps] >> We have to find out more about this thing. Who else is playing it. Any idea where to start? >> [techno music playing] >> SARA: Curran's friend saw him before he was killed. She works here. >> [techno music playing] >> Novak, what the hell are you doing? Who's he? >> Well, you're the one who knows all about my secrets. Why don't you tell me? Everyone's got secrets, honey, remember? >> I don't know what you're talking about, Novak. >> You and Curran had something going on, your little swinger's thing. Now you're going to tell me about the rest of it. What's my secret, Marie? >> If you're talking about what Curran said, he told me you were a stripper, okay? In another bar around here. Someone gave him this card, some kind of VIP pass. >> VERN: Was this it? >> What are you? Her pimp or something? >> Stripper? >> Romeo's girl. Place used to be a strip bar before it was abandoned. So who was the person who gave him the card? >> Well, I don't know. He just said some guy. >> Just some guy? Nothing else? >> All he said is he'd been given the VIP pass for a club and some kind of password, "I never sinned". You know, you say the password, you get a special treatment. >> I never sinned? >> You heard it before? >> WOMAN: He was just a little boy, Dennis Reveni, 12 years old. Why did you try to kill him? >> [fast forward] >> When he looks in the mirror, he knows...I never sinned. >> That's one very mixed up lady. >> Something happened to her, Vern. Straight A's through college, a good job, a family. She was playing this thing and she went crazy. >> Well, let's say something did happen to her. Some kind of cult thing maybe. We've got worse things to worry about here. Someone wanted us to find that body for a reason. >> Well...according to her public access file, Emily Gray was released from an asylum for the criminally insane last year. They keep her in a halfway house just outside Toronto now. >> Whatever is happening, it ain't over. >> [police radios] >> [on television] In breaking news, parts of Toronto University are being sealed off today as police investigate a murder. Known for the attempted drowning in 1992 of a small boy, Emily Gray, this morning, has confessed to killing a student from the local university. >> MALE REPORTER: Why did you do it, Emily? >> It's all part of the design. >> FEMALE REPORTER: Police are refusing all comments until a psychiatric assessment has been made. >> Still hasn't said anything? >> Other than her initial statement...no. And, of course, her request to see you. >> We found the body in the bushes by the library. It had been dragged there from someplace else. >> OFFICER: It's been identified. The victim is who she claims. >> JEFF: Jeremy Curran. It was all part of the design. >> In other words her wheel's spinning, but the hamster's dead. >> What about her lawyer? >> Oh, he's given clearance for you to talk to her. He thinks maybe she's seen you on TV before. Is making some kind of connection. >> Okay. Tom, let's get a copy of her character profile. Now she phoned it in initially right? >> Mmhm. >> Let's get a recording of that, too. Damned if I know why she wants to talk to me, but I promise you this, she won't ask twice. >> [police radios] >> I know what's happening. Buddhist monks knew it all along. What is the sound of one hand clapping? Where does the room go once you leave it? They believed once you opened yourself up to enigmas, you began to see the world differently. You know who the figure on this card is? Well, neither did I. So, I did some research. >> VERN: Nemesis. >> SARA: It's the closest translation they found for his name. He was an Indian monk from around 400 B.C. He broke away from his monastery and studied the way of enigmas. Two years later, he was executed for murder. You want to know how they caught him? He confessed. >> Emily Gray. >> Nemesis claimed--just like all the other mysteries of life--the murder and his confession could be understood through the contemplation of riddles. In the years after his death, a game was developed by his followers. The players solved riddles and wrote their answers on the temple of prayer. When, if they were diligent, it was said they would go to write their answers on the wall, only this time they would find a riddle waiting there instead--the final enigma. And if they solved it... >> ...they would see the design. >> Those that saw the design would then leave more riddles for others to follow. >> So Emily Gray tries to drown the boy after she plays the game. >> If she had drowned the boy, my guess is she would have confessed. >> But she failed. So they lock her up. When they finally let her out, she tries again. This time she does kill someone--your friend. And then confesses. >> Just like Nemesis. >> [sirens wailing] >> Vern, what are you doing? >> What I should have done from the start. >> What? You mean the police? First you want to leave them out of it, then when someone confesses you want to get involved? >> Sara, if you hadn't noticed, something's not quite right here. According to your stripper friend, someone tricked Curran into going to that building. It wasn't Emily Gray. It was a man. Someone you know. Think about it. The riddle you found in the subway wasn't random. They had to know who you were, what you were into. They even know about me, right? They left the riddle in the store. Whatever's going on here, it's not just about Emily Gray. >> We can't go to the cops. >> Yeah, well, watch me. >> Vern...what if it's real? What if there's something happening that we can't explain? Don't you want to know the answers? >> You just don't get it, do you? Your mother died. I'm sorry. That's messed up. But if you're looking for some kind of magic potion for your problems just because you had a rough ride, well, guess what? You're not the only one. Try watching two of your friends die in a construction fire that was you fault. Try getting over that in a hurry. We've withheld evidence of a murder here. If we don't tell the cops what happened, then our credibility is gone--and that's all we've got right now. We've got nothing but our word here. Find Romeo's girl and the word fear will be here. >> What are you talking about? >> Nothing. Maybe you're right. Maybe we shouldn't go to the cops. Go home. Get rid of anything to do with riddles, anything to do with the game. >> You think we can cover this up? >> Just that part of it. Get rid of everything that connects you to this thing. >> What about you? >> I've got to check something first. >> Hi, Emily. Didn't need to be like this, did it? >> [sighs] Emily Gray. First class honors, high school. Graduated, Vancouver. Everything seems to have gone along swimmingly until 1995. Then 1996...wow! You tried to drown a little boy in the lake... out of the blue. You served five years for that. You're only out for one and then this mess. You want to tell me what's going on? I mean, you do, right? That's...why you confessed. I'm all ears, Emily. You got something worth saying, let's hear it. What...the hell...happened? >> What if I told you that I knew the meaning of life? That every leaf that falls, every bee you crush underfoot, it's all part of a design. So complex it looks like chaos, but it's not. >> Is there a Santa Claus, too? Okay, you got me. What's the design? >> Describe the color red. Some things you have to see for yourself. >> Right. So, how do I see this design? Look, Emily, if you want someone who's going to pant and beg for what's going on in your head, you've got the wrong guy. Either you tell me what this is all about or I'm out of here--right? What's the design? Okay. That just about covers it. Good luck with the padded cell. >> Have you figured out why it happened yet? Your poor wife. Three days in a hospital, her ribcage crushed by the steering wheel. You haven't been able to make any sense out of it, have you? >> Who told you that? Look, just because somehow you got a hold of my file, doesn't mean to say I'm going to roll over and play dead. I hate to be the one to tell you this, lady, but there is no design. You're crazy. >> Am I? Because I tried to drown a boy? Because I killed a student? Is that so wrong? Is an earthquake wrong when it kills? Or a car or a flight of stairs. Why don't you just admit it? You don't understand why anything happens and you never will. >> [file drops] >> Congratulations, Emily. You're the only one in the whole wide world who knows the design. >> Not the only one, Jeff. There are many of us. When I look in the mirror, I know his name. Another who has seen the design as I have. Look at it in the mirror. >> Look at what? >> Ask your daughter. >> [frantic music] >> [phone ringing] >> Hello? >> JEFF: [on phone] Sara, I need you to listen to me. >> Dad. >> Do you know anything about a woman named Emily Gray. >> What? >> She claims...you know something about a design. She looks in the mirror and she says she sees a name. Do you know what that means? Does this mean anything to you, Sara? >> Yes. >> Listen, I want you to go get in your car and go to the house. Do you understand? I want you to go somewhere safe. Sara... >> I...yeah. Erm, yeah, I'll go. >> JEFF: [oh phone] It'll be okay. I'll see you soon. >> [suspenseful music] >> Dennis Reveni. >> WOMAN: He was just a little boy, Dennis Reveni, 12-years-old. Why did you try to kill him? >> When he looks in the mirror, he knows... I never sinned. >> [computer bleeps] >> I'm here. So where's the word of fear? >> [computer beeps] >> [computer beeping] >> All right, I'm here. This is what you wanted, right? I was supposed to come here with the answer. Well, here I am. You win, man. I thought you were the village idiot, okay? You win, man. What do you want from me? >> [thud] >> You want to kill me, hmm? Is that it? Do you want to kill me, too, you ghost? Bring it on. "What eats to live, but never drinks?" >> [clattering] You want me to answer it? Is that it? You want me to come down here and write the answer to your riddle on the wall? What eats to live, but never drinks? What eats to live, but never drinks? >> Oh! Oh. Sorry. >> I was just this little boy and I was playing by the water and she came up and she tried to push me under. She tried to kill me! And I never understood why... until I found this riddle. When I answered it, I suddenly knew. It's all part of the design, Sara. You un--you understand, you know. No matter what we do, Emily showed me. There's no right or wrong. There's only the design. We kill because there's no reason not to. You can't run away from it, Sara. We all have our role to play in this. I know mine. Do you know what yours is? Arrghh! [gasping] You'll see it soon. >> [gun shot] >> [scream] >> Tom, is she okay? >> Whoa, whoa! Boss, boss, boss... >> What? >> Just...just give her a minute. >> Well, what happened? A street kid attacked her. We got two witnesses inside. >> Street kid? >> He died ten minutes after we got here. >> Oh! >> There was a struggle, he had a gun. >> Who was he? >> That's what we're trying to get from her now. >> Sara, I need you to think really clearly right now. I want you to tell me exactly what happened. >> I told you. I was attacked by a gun man. His name was Dennis Reveni. >> What was he doing here? You knew who he was. Sara? When we searched the body, we found this in one of the pockets. It appears he knew who you were. >> Sara, are you okay? Baby? On the phone, you said you knew something about all of this. You've got to help us now. What happened? Sara, please! You know, honey, we might never know why mom died. But if we knew all the answers, we wouldn't be human. Maybe...maybe not knowing the answers but going on living, that's what life's all about. Tom. >> TOM: Yeah? >> I'm going to take her down to the station myself. >> You okay? You want me to come with you? >> No, we'll be...be okay. >> All right. >> Sara! >> Vern? Vern, are you in here? Do you know the answers now? Do you understand? Is there really a design? >> It was all part of the design, Sara. >> *
