Why don't you continue, Chief Inspector? You're in such good form today. Please, punish me! At last! It's never been that good. Do you admit... - Yes. - ...that you are a danger to men. - Indeed. And that you deserve punishment. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Stop! Enough of these extra pleasures. - No, please, just a few more. Defendant, if you don't withhold, we will tickle you with our rods. That would be too good to be true. Please, do it. I'm ready for anything. But don't forget I'm a woman. What further satisfaction do you seek for? - Anything a woman can hope for. Good girl, are you... - Yes, I'm horny. Good girl, are you... - Yes, I'm a nymphomaniac. To free you from this condition once and for all, I will do what has never failed, even in the worst cases. My great buddies will put you into a healing sleep with lasting effects. All your buddies? Great. Your bedroom manual is filled to bursting with virtues. You will be sentenced by all men present here. Wonderful. It's always been my dream to be sentenced by men. You will be the devil's hellion. No, please. No! Lead her to the hardest bed of her whole career. - No, no! To the scaffold. I haven't exploited all possibilities yet. I know incredible tricks. I'll teach them to you. You can only teach something to the devil. Where is the devil? No, no... He'll come to get you. Just a second. Take it easy. - No! What's that? - Your execution. Okay then, god damned! One is not enough for you? Even in your damnation you stay unmoved. Damnation? I hope hell will be extremely enjoyable. You'll know soon enough. The next one to kiss you is the devil. So that's the reward for the pleasures I have given you men? The guillotine is your prize. So now you are in your favorite position. Maybe the devil don't even fancy her. So what? I'm sure he'll learn to fancy her and burn her properly. Silence! No private conversations between executing officers, please! Go for it, men! Here we go! In the name of the nation of men... - Stop! Executioner, do your duty! Can't you wait another hour? I have to lay the judge before I go to hell. No! We are roasting the rascals. Angels and the whole of high society, from head to toe. As a hog roast on the spit... As omelette surprise! Let them go to hell! And who are they about to serve? Me! Welcome, milady. - Where am I? Exactly where you belong. People call it hell. A lousy word. As lousy as mankind itself. And I really continue to live on here? So there is really a life after death? Life... Another awful word. By the way, you will remain here with me until eternity. Here in hell. You said eternity? And how long does that last? - Endless. Without end? - Precisely, Marilyn. I understand. Will I like it? We'll be able to tell from your personal file. Today is the 14th, 2:30pm. One second... Yes. What's that? It says another day here. You see? An error. - The judge and I should have... Curse it! My agents made a mess again! These idiots! - The judge was my type... You've come too early. It's not your turn yet. You said 'your agents'? Who are you then? This one and you in one person. But you're a man of flesh and blood. - Yeah, well... I have to see it for myself. - You're getting closer. You simply can't let it be. Maybe you will enjoy my rod. You don't even exist! The devil exists. You better believe it. He is the one within you. I am your second ego. The only thing certain for me is that you made a mistake in getting me here too early. I admit it. - And how do you plan on making it up to me? You would've been due on the 15th anyway. So, it's only a question of one night. And for that you are making such a fuss? Even if it was only an hour, I could've used it. But you don't think you could manipulate your list of sins in such short time. Luckily, I am stuck far too deep in you. You're already in my possession. You obey me: your senses, your cravings... My senses are not that devilish. I will decide that. I'm the one controlling your phantasies, your lust. It's about time to realize that. But you should give me another chance. Let me go back for one last time. Let me see what can be done... Curse it. You attended a black celebration in honor of the devil. Is that true? - Yes. You've had it off with men and women... Our laws don't forbid that. And I've paid my taxes always on time. Nobody will deny that. I've always been good to sleep with. Yes, I can testify to that. I gave uptight men happiness and love. Every human being has a right to be physically happy. Talking of human rights all the time but forgetting the right to sex. Good, good! Sexuality is our fulfillment on earth and the relief from enforcements dictated to us. Good, good! - Not even the devil has the right to intervene in a girl's sexual freedom. Human society does it all the time. So, what will happen to me? As soon as I push this button, you will return to earth, Marilyn. I'm sure you already know how to spend your remaining days on earth. I will live them according to my creed. I have never been prude. For the freedoms I'm taking, I'm ready for hell. Such a stupid talk... Hell? Hell is within you. Gentle Archie! Archibald, what a good dancer you are! - Thank you. You're equally good at other things? - Yes. You'll be sorry if you're not. I am crispy, aren't I? Take them all. Sweet Satan, you. - You're no angel yourself! Hot! Like the devil. Jimmy! Let loose! You can do it! How good it works... Wonderful! - It's like baking Pretzels. Should I stop? Is it enough? - Yes. Yes, that's enough! Oh Carlos! Carlos, I can't... Carlos. He's too good for the fire. You have a fire in you, you could melt a glacier with. Wait, not so stormy. Come here, you old sweet polar bear. Come on up. I'm getting really hot. You are such a wickedly crafty slut. You can breathe down men's neck! You are like this fire spitting Mount Vesuvius! He and the others were only a straw fire. Marilyn! Come, come. My agent is waiting for you. Nothing will help you put out the fire, that the devil has started within you. Calm the lust, he has triggered off you. Only a man... No, many men... Archibald, Jimmy, Carlos, Otto, Mephisto... You are made to give and get pleasure. No one can blow out the flame. You're damned to burn for the short time left to you here and for eternity. Yes, I'm coming. In the middle of the night. What a stupid idea. Women. Yeah, who's this? - This is Marilyn. She's dead. - You're crazy. But... - I'm still alive. Sorry, but aren't you mistaken? - Hardly. I was at your funeral this afternoon. You've been in my bed. - They carried you to your grave today. Stop it, Eulenspiegel. - I swear... I swear that I'm alive. - No. How was I? - The way one is at one's funeral. - I meant in bed. I've cried my eyes out. How sweet of you. - Marilyn... Jack, my darling, you know I am a little banal. - True. I hope you will excuse me... - If you... - ...if I... - ...are dead? ...hang up now. - Tell me at least where you are calling from. - Bye. Bye? I'll be on my way. Even if I've to run after you into hell. I have to get into her apartment. That much is clear. It was quite a merry evening. Miss Marilyn would lament because I'm coming home so late. God, I am so thirsty! What's happening? Are you crazy? - But aren't you dead? I've just returned from your funeral feast. - That wasn't my body. Not yours? - Come here. - No. A ghost! I've lost my mind. I'd prefer you losing your mind to me being a ghost. But I can relieve your mind. Ghosts don't weigh as much as me. You're... You're still feeling warm. You see? Come and sit down, Dorte. Now tell me: How was my funeral? All the old boys were there. Tearful. Archibald, Jimmy, even Otto. Really? - Yes, it was a glamorous double funeral. First yours, then Carlos'. - Carlos'? - Both in one go, so to say. Did he die out of grief over me? - Not really. It has been like this: The morning you died, the doorbell rang. Out of piety for that day, you shouldn't have opened the door! And who else should have received all the flowers and wreaths of your lovers? And who else should sleep with them? With my due respect, this thought did come into the gentlemen's minds too. So what? - Mr. Carlos' actions had quite final consequences for him. So, it has happened. - Yeah, it's happened, Mr. Carlos. Fate is stronger than us, Miss Dorte. I will for always remember the pleasure the dear departed has given me. Her liberal and open manner was peerless. Please come in. Madame's friends are certainly welcome to share in my pain. Thank you. Please do accept this wreath as an symbol of my deep felt sadness. Under these laurels she shall rest. Take off your coat, please. - Like in old times. Your mourning dress suits you very well, Blondie. Do you still remember? Every Tuesday... - This way, Mr. Carlos. - My pleasure. If you don't mind, I will take the wreath into the lounge. As you know, I've always brought her flowers. Everything here is at your command. - Thank you. You are so kind. Till now you never had a chance to take advantage of my kindness, unfortunately. Yes, unfortunately. But the final chapter has not yet been written. But as you see, just looking at this rocking chair overwhelms me. Me too. - Please put it over there. That's the place we loved the most. I'm not sure you'll understand, but she was so gloriously vivid when she sat down on it. And on her bed, she was vivid too. And now she's dead. - Yes. - Stone-dead. Truly a great tragedy. - Yes, terrible. How old are you? Now you're all alone, you'll need someone. You've hit the nail right on the head. - Let's hit it then. Sure, if you think it's doable? But of course. The impossible always gets settled instantly. Only miracles take me a bit longer, my Blondie. Depends on the partner. The dear departed must have been the perfect partner, yes? No doubt, she was a marvelous woman. But once you take off your clothes, sweetie, who knows what I'll be capable of. The fact that you are no longer a forbidden fruit to me, gives me an instant bounce. I can feel it already. Only good be spoken of the dead and the departed but men really like changes. When I think how hard I tried to make you see me during her life. But you only had eyes for her ample breasts and her big... - Express yourself, Blondie. I don't have that much to offer, right? - You're alive, this gives you a benefit. The departed was unique but we have to forget about that. I will find out now how you make miracles happen. No! Leave your glasses on. Or else I don't stand a chance. You'd see everything even smaller. You cute little bunny! Get some self confidence. You're fresh and soft, exactly what an elderly experienced gent like me loves most. Madame sometimes embarrassed me with her fancy requests. Now I can admit it: Her charm was a little too brutal for my liking. Nothing bad about the dead, but I prefer something alive like yourself, of course. In this situation, I've no use for a dead woman. Everything at the proper time. There must be order. - Surely! How about a miracle now? - Don't let me stop you, Blondie. I won't. I'll tame you... Tame you... You wild cat, you! Oh, Dorte! Dorte! I'm coming as fast as you do. I can make miracles happen. Can't you feel it? Wonderful! Finish him off! Yes, finish him off. Go on! - Yeah. You would like that, you old horndog! What's wrong with you? Darling, no! What a beautiful death. It's mean to make fun of this. Shall we have a bet, darling? I'm sure the old boy isn't dead. Kiss me! Your kisses taste of bitter almonds. You are poisoned after all. Nonsense! Start. Get the feather. If you think you can bully me around like before, you're mistaken. At your grave I swore, I will never get dependent on another woman again. The matter with me and Carlos worked perfectly. - Really? But he's dead. And if he isn't? I will drive you mad with jealousy. - Nonsense. I will have it off with your lovers. - You? With all of them at once. - Witch! Then you'll see how it is to be only watching. You spy on me? - What did you think? I can't keep away from the keyhole. Just wait. - At least I want to have a piece for myself when you're cheating on me. Come! - Now you want me. But when your lovers appear again... I only want you. Come closer Even closer. Come. - Yes. This gives me great pleasure. Darling. Marilyn. Will you forgive me for being mean to you earlier? Yes. I forgive you anything. You are better than all men I had all together. I had hundreds... Darling! Come! You will give up Carlos? - Yes. You will not spy on me? - No. Never again. You will not steal any of my lovers? - No. None. You will stay with me forever? - Yes. You want to be totally dependent on me? - Yes. The devil has possessed her. Her good resolutions are gone with the wind. I hear someone. - Dorte. The door has been opened. - Is it Jacques? I called him earlier. I can't possibly see him. - Why? I've had so much fun with him at the funeral. - So you had it off with him too? See you later, Darling. - I want to know whether you've had... Bye. See you later! That's definitely your voice. - And everything else too. True! - As you can see I can't be killed. Kind of you to be still living. - Hello, Jacques. Exciting as always. - Yes. Little kiss... And who did you sleep with after my death? - You don't assume that I... With you, one never knows. I was heartbroken. - Yes, with Dorte. With your friends. Only with them. - Really? I've had so many friends. I hope you don't regret that. You seem so changed. You haven't been like this before. Why? - If I only knew. Please, be like you used to be. OK? Don't worry, sweetie. You are as sexy as you've always been. Kissing you is as good as before. Your body is gorgeous: so warm and vivid. I'm the same as before. But you aren't yet. We could change that. Patience, babe. In a bit you'll have your old Adam back. - It's about time. Now you're your old self again. You just can't wait. - Yes, Jacques. That's your biggest appeal. - Come on! I'm already here... - Finally! Jacques! - Marilyn... Sweetie... We are together again, Marilyn. - Jacques... I do what I can, sweetie... Now you can feel that I'm alive. Right? - Yes. Take me! Dorte! Dorte! Stay with me. Stay with me. Send her away! Away! Stay! Stay! I'm staying. To hell with her! Send her away! To hell with her! She's been there already. - But she has returned. Yes, she was wilder than ever before. Tell me about it. She was so nicely dead. - But now she's so nicely alive again. And makes me suffer with her moods. She pleases me because she is a real woman. One that can never get enough. - Right! She can never get enough. Never enough! Never get enough! Never get enough! Never get enough! It's your fault I had an attack. Because of you I have to burn in hell. Carlos! Dorte! Dorte! Dorte! Why don't you come closer? I am sleeping with Jacques right now. Can you hear us? Jacques? He doesn't exist. Only a horndog. Here! Bring him here! Here! - I am with Marilyn. More! More! Farewell, Jacques. I need her. - I need her! Dorte! - Yes? Dorte! Yes? Come! I'm coming! - Come! I'm coming! - Here! Come! - I'm coming. Marilyn! - Jacques! Witch, do you know who I am? Jacques? - No. Carlos? - No. A man! A man... Slut! - Carlos! I'm burning. - Come! You too are possessed by the devil. - Yes. I give it to her better than you. Slut! I'll make it better for you! - Yes! - No, me! Carlos! - No, me! No, me! - No, me! I'm the first. In hell I can be forever. Forever! Get away from here! Do you feel the devil in you? - Yes. It's so nice. Are you the devil's? - Yes. Then I shall stay. Send him to hell! I shall stay. I shall stay. - Send him to hell! Jacques, where are you? - I'm coming. To hell with you, you devil! - I'm a man! You hate him! I'm a woman! - Here she is. A man, a woman. A man, a woman... Ugh, yuck! Are you dependent on me? - Yes. Are you my slave? - Yes. Will you forever serve me? - Yes. Then come. Follow me. Into hell! - Yes. Come closer. Closer. Dance with me! Dorte? Dorte! Damn! Dorte! - Yes, one second. I'm coming. What's the rush? Here! Dorte! - One can't get any peace in this house! Hurry up! This infernal machine is finishing her off. Or you... - Me? Dorte. You're very slick. Truly. - Yes? Your hands are talented. Almost too talented. Soft little paws... So I'm talented after all, right? What about a small salary rise? - Yes. I've earned it. - Yes. Hello, this is Marilyn. - You are alive? Archi told me you've bitten the dust. This is Otto. - You all should stop that. It's really too silly. But he was at your funeral. Come and see for yourself. - Okay. When? As soon as possible, of course. Meaning now. You know I'm not patient. That's true. By the way, how is Dorte? Talking to me but really talking about her. You too have it off with her behind my back. - What do you mean, 'me too'? - Lovely! I will seriously think about this. You hear that? - Oh, come on... Forget it. - See you soon. - Say hello to Dorte. - You will see her. That's a mystery to me. I have see for myself. Hopefully I can keep him quiet. Open the door! - Not a word, Otto. Please come in! Thank you, Miss Dorte. Will I see you later? - Doesn't look good today. I've just spoken with Marilyn on the phone. We want to sort out a dissent. You are expected. You have a visitor, Madame. Good evening, Marilyn. - Your coat, please. Thank you. - You're welcome. It's truly you, in flesh and blood. - Flesh and blood, Otto. This will solve that question. - Any more questions? Not from my part. But you said you had an uncertainty that occupied you. Let's forget about that. Agreed, I would most welcome that. - Then we are agreed. I would really love to dance. - My pleasure. Come. Since eternity. - Finally, once again! Sweetheart. - Marilyn. It's nice to feel your arms around me one more time. You will have the pleasure occasionally. - Who knows? My time is limited. In what way? - I have lots to catch up with before I... Maybe the devil will get me suddenly. Bang! Let him come. I will spoil his fun. You do that. I will reward you. Here's your prize. Grab it. Do you like it? - Again and again. You have the chance to win the big prize. But you have to get it yourself. It will go wrong. - No. Just pull on it. I enjoy that over and over again as well. My sweetie pie, you are and remain a hotshot. Absolutely fabulous. Otto, you're just perfect, even in sweater and trousers. - How will I be without them? Matchless. - Yes. Unstoppable. Like the devil. Didn't I want to spoil his fun? - Right. - One second... Seeing you like this, it will be hard. Best I wrap you up and take you with me. Take me with you? - In a few days I leave for Africa again. But it's so infernal hot there, you can walk around there the way God created you. Infernal hot? - Yes, an infernal heat. Repellent! I won't go there. Wait! - Darling, I love waiting. When I am as dead on as with you. No woman even comes close to you. Poor child. Infernal hot. I will cool you. Free you. You shall have him. My sweet little dolly. Have you been waiting for me? - Yes. Marilyn too? - Leave her... You've got it going... - Wonderful. You've been missing this, haven't you? - Yes. That's a hot ride, isn't it? - Yes. I'm burning. - Don't worry, baby. A special kind of cooling down... We have to be careful. She mustn't see us. Don't bother. She always steals the show from me with her super breasts. - Or you're going to steal the show from her. You disgusting, revolting chameleon. Having fun with my lovers at my expense. You are gas. Absolutely gas! Aunt Sally! Freeloader! Bastard! Slut! Wait till we see each other in hell! You feel like you're getting higher and higher? - Yes, all the way up. Here you are again, milady. Your time is up. May I ask for your confession? Yes, I have loved. I have felt and given pleasure. I may have committed bigger sins than other human creatures, but only because I'm like that is no reason to send me to hell. Undoubtedly you have a wrong idea of hell. As your fellow humans, much to my regret, have a wrong idea of me. Hell doesn't exist. What you'll sense as hell is your demand to live your life as before. And he is truly damned who can't find a way to part from his habits. You were enabled to love a lot on earth and to be loved. To love a lot is one of the human virtues. Looking at it in that light, you were virtuous. But then I ought to go to heaven... Heaven is outside my competences. I don't manage these kind of societies. In my opinion, it wouldn't be anything for you. Because of the climate. The air condition could stop you from walking around the way you're used to. Fact is I have to give up well loved habits here and there. In confidence, do you really live here alone, on the far side of civilization? Of course not. If you count sex as part of civilization, you and I would have to come to an agreement. Then I would ask you to send me to the region you are managing. Your wish is my command, milady. Hello, lad, how are you? - You are the whore of Babylon personified. Darling, I can still confuse you. Go to the Deuce, woman! You are to blame for my damnation. Me? You're mistaken. Fact is you died in Dorte's arms. I've always been treating you softly and thoughtfully. Tenderly and devoted. Fatty, don't be grumpy. You've always loved our drolly vampire games, haven't you? Be honest, my golden bunny. I promise you, it will be just as great as in the past. Stop touching me, horny slut. You can only find what you're looking for with the devil. But maybe the devil can't offer what I am looking for with you. Don't think that your cheap tricks still work with me. I'm cleansed. It's not gonna work. Even if you show me your super body in large, it won't work with me anymore. You're more likely to push a bullock off its feet than to overcome my fortitude. If only you hadn't started talking so puffy here in the netherworld. You had such a kind and pleasant manner. Tempi pasati. Hell manipulated me into a saint. I'll have to produce relief. Maybe it's just a Fata Morgana. You see something that's not there. Hell is unlikely complicated. That much I've learnt already. Look here, Carlos. I can't see anything. - You see paradise, the apple and Eve. I only see a huge stone desert. - Carlos! Help! Let me go! You just can't execute me twice! I'm already dead! Stop screaming! Stop the chatter! We decide how often you die! - Dead persons can't die. Besides I'm already in hell. No reason to pinch me, stupid devil. Keep your legs still! - The devil who pinches your calves. You would like that! A hell you've been longing for. As potent as you picture your men... even the devil can't keep up with it. How do you want to know? You don't even know him. I've met him. He's extremely charming and very sexy. He isn't as much to your taste as you imagine. Want to bet? I can hardly wait to be all his. He's always been in you. Damn! Marianne! - Yes, milady, just a second. - Get me my breakfast. I can't work magic. Always this bullying tone. I really have to break her of this habit. Either she stops that, or I resign. What took you so long? I expressly instructed you to wake me early. When I sleep late I always have nightmares. I beg your pardon. I didn't wake you on purpose. After this terrible night I figured... What happened last night? - A terrible thunder storm. Didn't you hear it? Yes, but I thought I was only dreaming. - You didn't dream it. It happened for real. You can go, Dorte. - Marianne, milady. Not a difficult name to remember. By the way, you had three calls: From Mr. Carlos, Mr. Jacques... Tell me... When did you clean out the fire place? But it didn't burn. - But last night, the letters I've... I sat by the fireplace and read. But we haven't lit it so far this autumn. No? I must be mistaken. You can go. By the way, I have a request. Could I take off this afternoon? I have to attend a funeral.
