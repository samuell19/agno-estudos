Andale. - This is all of the holding cells that we currently are filling, and, uh, there's another set on the other side. We keep them separated by age and by gender. Everybody goes through a screening process to determine who their consulate is. As you can see, we're overpopulated and understaffed, but we're kind of used to that at this point. We do our best to take care of everybody in the same way. - He had a phone call yesterday.

Again, file number 264-499-838. Oscar Fernández. - Oscar Fernández, correct? Let's proceed. File number 264-499-838, is it true that your name is Oscar Fernández? - Sí, mi nombre es Oscar Fernández. - Yes, my name is Oscar Fernández. - Just answer the questions with yes or no, please. - Do you understand? - Sí. - Yes. - Are you prepared and willing to proceed with this hearing without counsel? - Sí. - Yes. - The court notes that the respondent has chosen to proceed, thereby waiving their right to counsel. Oscar Fernández, you are now under oath. First, are there any documents that you wish to present to the court here to support your case? - Sí. - Yes. - Thank you. Is there anything the government wishes to enter? - No, Your Honor. - Oscar, is it true that you were born in Honduras and that you are not a citizen of the United States? - Sí. - Yes. - Is it true that you illegally entered the United States on May 10th of this year? - Sí. - Yes. - You reported that you had an uncle, Manuel Fernández. You are currently in his custody. Is that correct? - Sí. - Yes. - Noted. Let's proceed, Oscar. Why did you choose to enter the country illegally? - Honduras is very dangerous. - Why is it dangerous? Bad people. - When you say "bad people," am I to infer criminal gangs? Can we make a note that the defendant nods? You have to answer the questions yes or no. - Sí. - So your fear of these gangs is the reason you think you should be allowed to stay in the United States. - Sí. - Yes. - Did they ever threaten you? - They put a gun to my head and they told me that I had to join the gang or they would kill me. - Noted. And did you join the gang? - Sí. - Yes. - And did you subsequently take part in any criminal activity? They forced me. - What type of criminal activities did you witness during your time with the gang, Oscar? Several things. - What things specifically? They would steal things. - Did you see or participate in any acts of violence? - Please answer the question. - I saw how they shot a boy. - You witnessed the gang murder a boy? - They don't care. - They shot a boy from my school. They left him there laying in the street. - His family couldn't even take him that day. - They just left him there in the street. - And where were you when they shot this boy? Oscar, did you participate in any way in the death of this boy? - Did they force you to do something, Oscar? - I will ask you one more time to answer the question. - Answer the question! Put your earphones back on immediately. - Put your headphones back on now. - Oscar, answer the question, please. - Oscar? Oscar, I understand why you're afraid to go back to Honduras and why you came here. But tragically, gang violence is very widespread throughout your country. - I cannot give you asylum in the United States. - But since you're under the supervision of Manuel Fernández, you will receive notification by mail. - Okay, okay. No, no, no, no. Hey. Fuck me. - Fuck me. - No, no. - Shh. Ah.
