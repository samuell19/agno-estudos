(gentle music) (birds chirping) (children giggling) - Tara! I can touch the sky! (laughs) - No, no, Katy, you mustn't! (Katy giggles) - [Katy] Whee! - [Child] Wow! - Whee! (laughing) Oh no! (laughing) I can fly! Look at me, Elsie. - Oh no! - Look at me. (laughs) (child gasps) - [Child] Look out! (woman screams) (wood clattering) (glass shattering) (child laughs) (woman screams) (playful music) (chickens clucking) - Oh. - Katy Carr! How many times have I told you to stay off that swing? Must be a hundred or more. - I didn't mean any harm, Aunt Izzie. If only you hadn't come in the way-- - Oh, so it's my fault I suppose! - No, no, I didn't mean that, but-- - You always have some dandy reason for everything that goes wrong, Katy. Well, this time I've got one, too. It's you. (door creaks) (knocking on door) - One moment please. Now, who's next? Oh, Miss Carr. Can't it wait till after surgery's done, Izzie? - No, it can't, Dr. Carr. - Come in. Excuse me, this won't take a moment. - Good luck, Katy. - Now, what seems to be the problem? - You may make light of it, Philip. I tell you I've had enough. - As it happens, I'm glad that you came in because there is something I wanted to talk to you about-- - No, don't go distracting me. I will have my say this time. She has to go away to school. - But it won't happen again. - That's for sure. - What was it this time, Katy? - I was just swinging on the rope and-- - She destroyed the whole back yard. - Izzie, please. Let's just have the facts. - Well I did, pretty much, but I never meant to. - Well then, I guess you should put it back to rights. And maybe that swing should be out of bounds? - It was out of bounds. The child is running wild! She doesn't listen and no more do you. - If you just giver her her head a little, then maybe she'd come round. - Give her her head anymore and it will come right off! No, Philip. You must send her to school. - No. Please, Daddy, don't! - Now, we don't want to rush this. You never know what's gonna happen next. - Nothing will happen if you have your way. - I agree. I think it's time something changed around here. - Philip. - Cousin Helen, she's coming out of hospital. - Cousin Helen that's always sick? - Uh-huh. She asks to see the children. What do you say? - Bring her back here? Are you crazy? - Oh, come now, Izzie. Helen is one of the family. Where else should she go? - After all that's happened here, this is the last... Well, if Cousin Helen wants to see the children, she certainly doesn't need any more trouble. Katy will have to go. - I don't think she'd like it here. - [Izzie] Besides, how can she possibly stay here? Where will the nurse sleep? - No nurse. She's had her fill of nurses and doctors. She'll only agree to come if I promise not to be a doctor anywhere around her. - You mean you've asked her already? Oh, Philip, you haven't. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (children laughing) - [Katy] Hurry up now. (laughing) - Come on, Johnnie. Katy will eat all the picnic. - Thumper doesn't want to go to the lake. She's too tired. - Why didn't you leave her home then? - I'll carry her. - You're too small. - I'm not. I can even push Robbie Taylor over. - Can you? - Yes. And I did, too. (playful music) (Thumper barks) (water splashes) (children laugh) - [John] Dorry, I found something! - It just doesn't make any sense. Cousin Helen is coming here to see me and Aunt Izzie's fixing to send me away. - I wish I could go, too. Mother says it would put notions in my head. - (scoffs) Aunt Izzie thinks it will take the notions out of mine. (sighs) It's not fair. Cousin Helen can't do a thing for herself. She's not going to like it here one bit. And I mean, I'm the eldest, I'm supposed to take care of the tiddlers. How can I do that while I'm away at school? - Katy? - This is my home. I don't want to have to leave-- - Katy! - (sighs) What is it, Elsie? Are you spying again? - No, I am not. - Elsie Eavesdropper. (slams book shut) - You'll catch it, Katy Carr. - Oh, Elsie, come back. I was only joking. (sighs) Drat her. What did she mean anyway? - (laughs) The tiddlers, I guess. - Ugh! John! Dorry! Get out of there. The leeches will suck your blood until you drop down dead! - [Dorry] Ew, quick Johnnie get out. - You see, they need minding all the time. Aunt Izzie only notices the bad things. She'd really miss me if I was gone. - I'd miss you, too. - She says at school they'll make me act like a proper lady. - But that's just getting older, like putting your hair up. - But it's different. People change when they leave Burnet. Look at Ned, I hardly even recognize him. - Well maybe. But he's nicer. Isn't he more, more of a gentleman? - Cecy, are you going soft on Ned Clark? - No! Of course not. A person can't help noticing that's all. Anyhow, it's you he's sweet on. - I've known him since we were babies. - Known who? - Nobody. - (laughs) Only you. (girls laugh) Must you wear that uniform all the time? - Most of the fellows do. (Katy sighs) You want to hear something scary? - What? - You promise not to tell? - Promise. - Promise. - No, it's not for girls. - If you don't tell me right now, I'll throw that fancy hat of yours into the lake. - Gonna have to catch me first. (all laughing) (leaves crunching) Oh! - Give it. (Katy laughing) Got it! (panting) Tell me! Now! - All right, all right. It's in the barn, back of Fraser's place. - What is? - A dead body. - You're kidding, aren't you? - Joe Taylor told me. - Told you what? - A corpse in Fraser's barn. - Oh, my word. A dead person? - Let's go see it. - No, we can't. We should tell somebody. - I might take a look, though, so as I can tell the Sheriff. You coming, Katy? - Yeah. You don't mind, do you Cecy? - No, of course not. I'll take the tiddlers. You go on. (bright music) - Come on. (birds chirping) - You ever see a dead body? - Nope. You still want to go in? - Well, we might as well, now that we're here. (suspenseful music) (door slams shut) (children gasp) (door creaks) Oh my. (gasps) - I told you. - Wonder how long he's been here. Smells pretty bad. - It must be new dead. Rats would eat the body. - Well, dead bodies go stiff. You know, rigor mortis. We should probably check. Look. His name's inside. I wonder how he died. - You better not touch it. - Why not? - Katy! - Shh! Oh! (man groans) - Oh no! (Katy gasps) (man groans) (playful music) - Katy, you all right? I lost my head there for a moment. - Ned, I think he's really sick. I think we should get help. - Right, come on then. - No, I think I better stay here with him. - I don't reckon I should leave you alone. - Fetch my father. Quick! (Ned gulps) (dramatic music) (straw rustling) Here. (stammering) Don't worry, my father's a doctor. (man grunts) (gentle music) - Oh, you silly, silly girl. Put those filthy clothes in the bonfire, Debbie. - Yes, Miss Carr. - Not the hat. Please, Aunt Izzie. - All of them. (Katy sighs) - Weren't you scared? - Oh no, it was too exciting. - Did you undead him, like Jesus? - For heaven's sake child, where do you get such notions? - But it was like Jesus. - Well, I'm sure our Lord had the good sense not to bring his miracles home with him covered in bugs and lice and what not. - Oh, I'd have been scared half to death. Ned said you were cool as a cucumber. - Did he? - He tore in here like a hurricane. Aunt Izzie reckoned it was you hurt for sure. - Humph. Time to cut on home, Cecy. (Thumper barking) (man screaming) - Ow, ow, ow! What are you doing to me? That's cold! - Come away at once. Shame on you, making a spectacle of the poor wretch. (man screaming) - That's too cold, stop it! Stop it! - Oh! - [Man] You're a cruel man! (birds singing) - [Izzie] Now you see why she has to go away. This afternoon's nonsense was just typical. - [Philip] I don't think you can call it nonsense. She certainly meant well. - [Izzie] If intentions were all that counted, Katy would be an angel. - You have to admit she showed some courage out there. - She should never have been there in the first place. Alone in the woods with a raving drunkard. - [Philip] Harmless enough. - [Izzie] Thanks be. No, Philip, this won't do. She doesn't listen to me and without her mother, God rest her soul, to teach her how to-- - That's enough, Izzie. Don't you think I know that every day that goes by? (sighs) Well, I will speak to her in the morning. (door slams nearby) (footsteps approaching) (knocking at door) - I beg your pardon Miss Carr, Dr. Carr. That fellow is at the back door asking to see Miss Katy. - Certainly not, she's already gone to bed. You see? (Katy sighs) - Ah, there y'are. (Katy exclaims) Good evening, missy. - Evening. You look very smart. - Oh yeah, regular swell ain't I? - (laughs) I'm glad you kept your hat. - Ah, just got a little singed and I wouldn't know myself without it. - Sorry I got you a scrubbing. - Kind folks is just regular fiends for washing. - Aunt Izzie says cleanliness is next to godliness. - Amen. But it wears off soon. (Katy laughs) I put a mark on your post there. It's a thankee from a gentleman of the road to a proper young lady. - Thank you. - You mind yourself, now. - [Katy] I will. - Goodnight, missy. - Goodnight. (gentle music) (church congregation singing) ♪ Your holy light ♪ ♪ Give us thy light ♪ ♪ My soul my Lord ♪ - Why don't we cut through the woods? - But Aunt Izzie said to go straight home. - Well, we'd be home quicker than anyone. - Katy, did you forget about Cousin Helen? - How could I? - Hello, Katy. - Ned, where's your folks? - Back there, with Cecy's ma. She can talk. No wonder Cecy's got nothing to say. - Cecy's got plenty to say. - Not like you, though. A fellow can talk to you. - That's 'cause she's more like a boy than a girl. - Oh, mind your own business, Elsie! - How can I? You're yelling down my ear. - (sighs) Then walk ahead. (sighs) She's just a kid. Sorry. - You looked like you were praying pretty hard in there. - My cousin arrives today. She just has to like me. - Why wouldn't she? - I don't know, things always seem to go wrong. If only there was some way I could impress her right off. - Like a 21-gun salute? - That's right. (bright music) You couldn't, could you? - You bet. (Katy laughs) (bright music) (train horn blows) (bright music) - You sure this is going to work? - Sure, I just did the artillery course. (door creaks open) - (gasps) John. - What are you doing? - Gunpowder. - You gonna blow something up? - No. It's a spectacular. (bright music) - Elsie! Your hair is in rat tails again. Whatever will Cousin Helen think? - Aunt Izzie, what's a spectacular? (Katy sighs) - [Izzie] Katy? - Oh! (Katy groans) - [Izzie] Katy! - Bother! - [Izzie] Katy, where are you? (bright music) - [Katy] Ned, back here. (bright music) - I don't want to be a girl. I'm a boy! - Shh. - You look sweet Johnnie. (John scoffs) - All right, now, where is Katy? I suppose she hasn't washed yet. All right everyone, don't move a muscle. Perfect. Now just stay there. Katy! Katy! (Ned grunts) - [Katy] Oh, Ned, sorry. (dramatic music) - [Izzie] Katy! (match striking) Katy! There you are, Katy. (Katy gasps) Didn't you hear me calling? Ned, you cut along home now. Katy has to meet her cousin. (fuse crackling) - Uh... - Hurry up, Katy. Whatever will Cousin Helen think? - Oh. Coming, Aunt Izzie. - Come along then. Hurry up, come on. Line up. Line up. Hurry. Johnnie, come on. Katy. - Katy, where's the spectacular? - Uh, changed my mind. - Well, here we are at last. - Welcome back to Burnet, Helen. You know we live plain enough but I hope you'll enjoy the peace and quiet. This is Elsie, Dorry, Joanna. - Hi. - [Izzie] And this of course is-- (rocket bangs) (rocket whirs) - [Philip] What is that? (glass smashing) - The spectacular! - [Izzie] My china! (rocket whizzes) (explosion booms) (child screams) (rocket whizzes) (Thumper barking) (explosion booms) (all scream) (horse whinnies) (rocket whizzes) (explosion booms) (rocket whizzes) (explosion booms) (rocket whizzes) (girl screams) (rocket whizzes) (explosion booms) - [Katy] Oh no. (chickens clucking) - (laughing) Bravo, bravo! I'm Cousin Helen. And you must be Katy. (both laugh) - To do something so foolish, so dangerous. Whatever got into you? - Please don't send me away, Daddy. I'll be so good you won't even know I'm here. I can take care of the tiddlers. - (scoffs) As far as I can see, you are the main hazard in their lives. - I'll change, you'll see. I shan't tear my dresses anymore or get into scrapes. - Katy, you just blew up your last chance. Now, that kind of racket is all very well for cadets but it just won't do for young ladies. - I don't want to be a young lady! Why can't things just go on as they are? - And what about your cousin? Straight out of hospital and you launch a full-scale war on her. - It was exciting, though, wasn't it? (laughs) I never expected them to blow up like that. - Katy, I'm serious. This time, you've gone too far. Now, Mrs. Hall has told your Aunt of a fine school in the city. I'll be writing to the principal in the morning. And that is final. - Well, I hope you'll listen to your father more than you do to me. Heaven knows I'm sick of the sound of my own voice scolding. - I think we've settled things. How is Helen? - She's very tired and she hasn't an ounce of flesh on her bones. She needs proper food. But she's comfortable for the time being. Tidy yourself up, child. Your cousin wants to see you and you're no ornament as you are. - Cousin Helen? - Well, of course Cousin Helen. How many cousins do we have in this house? Though why she wants to see a troublesome creature like you, I can't imagine. (gentle music) (knocking at door) Here we go. - Thank you. You are kind. Well, Katy, that was the most memorable welcome I've ever had. Next time some music, what do you think? (Katy laughs) (Izzie sighs) You know Katy, I was a little afraid of your aunt when I was a girl. - Humph, excuse me. - And she hasn't changed a bit. (Katy laughs) I feel like I've never left. And yet, look at you! You're as tall as a sunflower. (laughs) She looks so like Ruth, doesn't she? - Does she? (stammering) I never, I don't see it. - Your mother had the most beautiful eyes. And yours are just the same color. - Are they? - (laughs) Yes. So tell me, what do you like doing best? - Me? I like climbing trees, reading, and I love to skate during the winter. - Me, too. I used to love skating. Do you remember that time, Philip, out on the lake when we had the dance and the band? The band froze up (laughs) and we all had to sing. ♪ Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah ♪ (Katy laughs) - Mm-hmm. Now, Katy, you're not to tire your cousin. - Uh oh. That means I'm talking too much. Never mind, we'll talk again tomorrow. And the next day and the next and the next. - (laughs) Oh, yes please. Oh, but I shan't be able to. I have to go away. - Away? - To boarding school. Because of the fireworks and everything. - Oh, but they were so wonderful! - Oh, to hear Katy, you'd think it was a jail sentence. Tell her, Helen, it'll be an adventure. - Well... It will and Katy will be a great success. - There, you see, your cousin agrees. - But Burnet's a hard place to leave, I know. And I'd hate to be the cause of Katy's going. - Oh, it's not you. Katy has had her chances. - Well, then for my sake. Please, Philip. I want so much to know Ruth's children. - Father? - Well, I'm not sure. - Thank you. - I only said I-- (Katy laughs) (bright music) (birds chirping) - Good morning. Isn't it a fine day? - Ah, there you are. Did you brush your hair this morning? - Not yet, Aunt Izzie. - Fit for a scarecrow, that's you. Do up those shoe laces, or you'll break something else. - Yes, Aunt Izzie. Good morning, Cousin Helen. How are you? I hope I'm not too early, but I've been up for hours. It's much too fine of a day to sleep. - You've, you've brought the sunshine. Please, open the blinds, Katy. (gentle music) (Helen laughs) - They're for you. - What flowers! Oh, they still have the dew on them. Katy, open my trunk and we'll find a vase. There, now, do you see the box? Look inside. It was given me by your mother. Set it here. Won't you have a rummage around, see if there's anything else you can you find. - It's like a treasure chest. (laughs) - Well, hardly treasure. I've become a magpie, hoarding bits of glitter in my nest. - Did you wear these to the dance? - The same. They might fit you. - The lake doesn't freeze over until Christmas most years. Will you stay that long? - I don't know exactly. I hope so. Come. So tell me, how is Burnet these days? (Elsie knocking) Elsie, more flowers? I'm spoiled. Come, bring them here, we'll mix them in together. Thank you. - Aunt Izzie was calling you, Katy. - I didn't hear her. - That reminds me Katy, I need your help. - You do? - With Izzie. She's after me to eat more and I can't. So, if you could fetch my breakfast and keep it small? - Don't worry, I'll be right back. (Katy laughs) - [Cousin Helen] There's no rush. - Whoa, whoa, steady there. Is it Derby Day? - Sorry. I've got to get cousin Helen's breakfast. - Of course. Katy, your laces! - Is Cousin Helen's breakfast ready? - Katy, must you thump so? Didn't I ask you to tie your shoelaces? - Cousin Helen wants me to take up her tray. - Huh, better not use the best china then. What little there is left of it. Oh no, no, no, for goodness sake, Debbie. We know how to treat our guests in this house. Some of that bread, if it's not too heavy again. - Nice and light this morning, Miss Carr. Master Dorry, you didn't! - I was near starving, Debbie. - Little so-and-so. I declare the child must have worms. Where's the powder? - No, Aunt Izzie, I don't have worms. I just growed in the night. - (sighs) Cousin Helen can't eat this. - Yes she can. Just cut off the crusts, Debbie. - I'll eat them! - You will go upstairs and stop all this growing nonsense. - Not so thick, Debbie. - Yes, Miss Carr. (gentle music) - I'll take it. - No, it's fine. See? (Katy gasps) (Elsie screams) (dishes smash) - Well, I guess that takes care of the breakfast. (laughs) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (children laughing) Oh no, if I eat anymore, I'll burst. - [Dorry] Oh, Debbie, I'll have that. - [Izzie] Oh, that's enough for you young man. - [Dorry] Will you play with us now? - [Izzie] Get along and don't bother your cousin. - I'd love to. How about tag? (children exclaim) My chair is home. You start from over there and Katy will stand guard. (children laugh) - They're not too much for you? - Oh no, it's what I dreamt of. (children exclaiming and laughing) Oh! (laughs) Oh, it's all right. - [John] Are you all right? - It's all right, it's all right. - [Katy] I've got an idea! (children laugh) - That child is a perfect nuisance. - No, she's a perfect tonic. - (laughs) To be taken with care. - [Katy] We're gonna have a race. (children laughing) - [Child] Father get in, get in. - What, me? I'm usually the donkey on these occasions. Okay, here we go. - Hey, it's not fair. Father's heavier to push. - Thank you. - We'll take the outside course then and Izzie, you must be starter. - [Dorry] Come on, Aunt Izzie. - It'll only end in tears. - [Child] Come on Aunt Izzie. Come on, Auntie! - All right then. (children laugh) Ready? Set. Go! (thrilling music) (children squealing and laughing) - [Child] Come on, push, push! Come on! (all exclaiming) (thrilling music) - Oh! (children exclaiming) - Oh! (Helen and Katy laughing) - (laughing) Well! (all laughing) (gentle music) (frog croaking) - (sighs) It's plain as day. Cousin Helen looks better already. - Oh, she is pretty. I loved the lace on her dress at church. - She has all her clothes made in Paris. She says they understand her funny shape. I don't think she has a funny shape. I think she looks just fine. - Do you think she had young men in love with her before she got sick? - Dozens. They drowned themselves in despair when she wouldn't have them. - Oh, did they? How awful. - (laughs) Noodle! That's only in books. - Well, Mother says it's vain and frivolous to care about things like clothes when you're sick. - That can't be so. Cousin Helen isn't a bit vain. - I'm sure you're right. Only Mother says she doesn't behave the way a sick person should. - Of course I'm right. She's my cousin after all. (dramatic music) (door clicks open) (door slams shut) Cousin Helen? (Katy stomping up stairs) - Katy. (laughs and sniffles) I was far away. - Should I go or... - No. I'm glad for company. (Katy sighs) Did you see these? - (laughs) Is that you? - Yes, and your mother. What a pair. (laughs) (Helen sniffles) - Was she your best friend? - Oh, yes. She was like a big sister, too. Full of plans and adventures. You remember her? - A little. The others don't. Not really. - It's hard, isn't it? She was so full of life. Now, she's only here, in our heads. - I can't see her face anymore. Only out of the corner of my eye. - She was like you. And not just to look at. - Was she? (Helen laughs) Father doesn't really like to talk about her. - She was so quick. She was (chuckles) full of ideas and energy. And yet, she had a kind of peacefulness. - That doesn't sound like me. I'm just the opposite. I'm always in a tangle. - It's there, though. Give it time. - You're not at all like I imagined. - (laughs) Aren't I? Why not? - I thought you'd be sad and serious all the time. - And instead, I'm foolish and frivolous. (Katy laughs) (dramatic music) - Some people think that when people are sick it's wrong to care about clothes and such. - I've heard that. I think sickness is ugly enough as it is. It doesn't need my help. And I don't think a bit of ribbon's going to turn our heads now, do you? - No. - (laughs) Good. Because I was hoping you'd take me shopping tomorrow. - We're going into town? Just you and me? (bright music) (horse clopping) - This, this is for Elsie. Oh and this for John, don't you think Katy? - John doesn't really like dresses that much. - (laughs) That's the truth. Wriggles like a fish when I try to measure her. - Oh, well, she'll wake up one day soon and change her mind. Especially when she sees the dresses that Mrs. Pettifer makes. (Katy laughs) (gentle music) Mm! It's delicious. - Oh! Thank you. (Katy laughs) (chickens clucking) Well, how about this one? - Did you pack a picnic? Oh, I see, you're wearing it. (both laugh) - Oh! (both laughing) - [Helen] Straight ahead. I'm ready for a cup of tea and something to eat. Aren't you? (door bangs open) - [Barkeep] You get out of here! (man groans) (both gasp) (man groans) And stay out! (water splashes) - [Helen] Goodness! - [Barkeep] No good bum. (man groans) - Oh, it's you. (spits water) - Hello there, Miss Katy. - Are you all right? - Well, it seems I can't get enough of this here washing. (both laugh) - You're supposed to do your clothes separately, you know. - Oh, really? Huh, well, I'll try that next time. I'll be seeing you, Miss Katy. - Bye. - A friend of yours? - Oh, uh... He was poorly and I-- - Lent him the soap? (both laughing) - Oh, do you have to tell Aunt Izzie? - [Helen] That we met a friend in Burnet? No surprise in that. (Katy laughs) - The coffee shop is just right here. (Helen laughs) (gentle music) - Good day. Could you help us in, please? - No room. - Well, perhaps if we put the wheelchair in the corner, out of everyone's way? - I said we're full. - But I can see plenty of spare tables. If you could just-- - They're for the regular patrons. - I'm sorry, I'm a little hard of hearing. Did you say rat poison in the coffee? - Uh-uh. (coffee shop woman stammers) - Well, thank you for telling us. We certainly will go elsewhere. Good day. - Oh! Oh! - Well, that was a lucky escape. - But you're not a bit deaf. - Oh, it's a well known fact that people in wheelchairs are deaf and dumb and quite frequently mad. So, where shall we have our tea, then? - There is nowhere else. We'll just have to go home. - Oh, no. Not until we've eaten. I don't know about you, but I'm as hungry as a wolf. Is that hotel out by the springs, is it still there? - The Spa? Oh, it's very grand. It's got carpet on the steps. - It's perfect for two grand ladies, then. (bright music) (motorcar rumbling) - Signorina, may I help you? - We'd like something to eat. Um, my cousin. (Helen laughs) - Signorina, this is a hotel residential only. I regret we cannot be of service. Perhaps if you try in the town. (Helen speaks foreign language) - Katy, we have come to the right place. This is Signor Rinaldo and he is quite the best majordomo in the world and he used to work at the Gran Palazzo at Como. (Helen laughs) (Rinaldo speaks foreign language) - Signora Helen, aha! I'm so happy to see you again. You come for the waters? - We've just come for some tea. Can you do it? (Rinaldo speaks foreign language) - Boys. (claps) Help the young lady, eh? Signora. (gentle music) - Oh! - Signora, you permit me, I must show you this place. It is my pride and joy. Tea for the ladies al terrazzo. (gentle music) (Katy exclaims) I come here because of you. I dream of the New World and then one day in Como you tell me to make, you remember, a place to dance on the ice. - I remember. - Yeah. - Oh, Rinaldo, que bella! Dance with me now. - Si? (both laugh) (both hum a tune) - Katy! Come! (both humming tune) (Katy and Helen laughing) (all humming) - Ah, Signora. It has been waiting for you, this place. Come. There is more. - Ah! (Katy and Helen laugh) (Rinaldo humming) (fountain spurting) (Helen and Rinaldo speaking foreign language) (both laughing) - You take the Signorina soon to visit my country? - I shan't. But when she goes, she will carry both of us in her thoughts. - Bravo! Ah, Signora, an angel guide you down here to make me glad. (Rinaldo laughs) - Oh. - You take care with this lady. She wind a string around your heart and she never let go. - Signor Rinaldo, I believe you've been taking too much of your own spa water! - Ah! (Katy and Helen laugh) I never touch, is horrible. - [Helen] Oh, is it? (all laughing) (glass shattering nearby) - I leave you. Signora. Signorina. - Mm! - Oh, he's right, though. You must go to Italy and feast. Mm, taste, touch, smell. Fill up your senses. Venice, Florence, oh, Verona, Rinaldo's Lake Como, they're all magnificent. You've so much to look forward to. You'll grow wings and fly away. - I don't want to fly away. Unless you come, too. - I'm home at last. I shan't be leaving. In fact, we should be getting back. Aunt Izzie will be wondering what's become of us. - Oh, she won't worry when I'm with you. You always make things go wonderfully. More cake? - No, I don't think I could. I am a little tired. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize. Do let's go. Signor Rinaldo, please help us! (dramatic music) (Helen coughing) (dramatic music) - Katy? Is that you? - Father. - Oh, Lord. Get her in the house. Fast! Come on, Duchess. Your aunt thinks I was wrong to bring Helen here. - That's not fair. She's part of the family. - Yes, she is family. And that's what Ruth... That's what your mother would have wanted. But Izzie is right. I hadn't thought it through. - I'm glad she came. She's not at all like a sick person. - No, she isn't, is she? - We went to the Spa Hotel. We were dancing in the ballroom. It was like something out of a storybook. (gentle music) Then she got so tired all at once. - I know. I know. She's very sick, you know. - What's wrong with her? - No one quite knows. A disease of the blood. When it began, she went in search of an answer. - A cure? - Oh, an understanding at least. It's hard to fight an unknown enemy. She set out alone. Trains and ships, hotels and hospitals. Every day a new place, strange faces. - She made it sound like an adventure. - Sometimes the company of strangers is easier to bear. - She will be all right, won't she? - She's come home, Katy. We must make the most of her. (birds singing) (gentle music) (Thumper barking) - You going to the lake, Katy? - No, thanks. - Are you gated forever? - Cousin Helen's really sick and I want to help her. (Katy thuds floor) - (sighs) Katy Carr, what will it take to get you to grow up? - Please, I need to see her, Aunt Izzie. Just for a moment. - Elsie, can I trust you to be careful? - Yes, Aunt Izzie. - Go down to the dispensary and get Helen's medicine from your father. - Yes, Aunt Izzie. (gentle music) Excuse me, I have to go and get Cousin Helen's medicine. - Let me do it, please. - Aunt Izzie asked me. - I need to see Cousin Helen. It's very important! - No, you get everything. It's my turn. Let me pass! I'll tell on you! - I don't care! - Then you don't care if Helen gets her medicine. (Elsie screams) (Elsie crying) - Elsie! Elsie, are you all right? - Leave me alone, leave me alone! - I'm so sorry! - Leave me alone, I hate you! Go away! (crying) - Elsie fell down the stairs! - Katy pushed me, she pushed me! - No! No, I didn't! We were arguing-- - Yes, you did! - She, she just fell! - Did she now? Elsie, stop your blubbering. Where does it hurt? - My head and my arm! - Oh! - Nothing a spot of arnica won't cure. As for you, Katy Carr, what devil is in you to hurt your sister so? - I didn't push her! - Yes you did! - I didn't, she just fell! - I will have none of your lies and excuses. You go up to your room at once. - I am not lying! - Katy, go up to your room this instant! - I'm not lying! - You go! - I didn't push her! - Katy Carr, you come back here right now! Elsie, stop it! Just stop it, you're all right. Calm down. (dramatic music) (Katy kicks bucket) (dramatic music) (rope snaps) (Katy screams) (cracking crash) - [Izzie] (distorted) How many times must I tell you? Don't go on that swing! - [Helen] It was a dance on the ice. Everywhere we went, there were rubies. (voices swirling) - [Philip] She's sick, very sick. (voices swirling) - [Izzie] Katy, are you all right? ♪ Katy Katy did you see what Katy did ♪ ♪ Katy Katy did you see what Katy did ♪ ♪ Katy Katy did you see what Katy did ♪ (gentle music) - No change. - You must rest. I'll sit with her now. - Dear God, if only I'd taken your advice, Izzie. Sent her away, none of this would have happened. - No sense taking blame on your shoulders when you have enough to bear already. - She's so young. It's a punishment. - Stop it, Philip, it was an accident. - Everyone I love is struck down around me, Izzie. - You're not being punished. Come on. Your job is to care for her. - I can't. - Philip. You must. - I don't know what to do. Spinal injury, it's so dangerous. Easy to do more damage. - Someone must know. (Philip sighs) - "All we know is how little we know." That's what Professor Reinhart used to say. He knew more about backs than anyone. - What about him, then? Reinhart? - Oh, he wouldn't come out here. - Ask him. What is there to lose? (gentle music) - Please come soonest, stop. Fear broken back, stop. Daughter, stop. Carr, stop. Is that correct, sir? We was real sorry to hear about the accident. Such a character, your Katy. Always getting in scrapes. (bell clanging nearby) That'll be 60 cents, sir. My wife said to say if you or Miss Carr need anything... - Just send that, please. (dramatic music) (horse trotting) (Thumper barks) - Thank you. And the big bag. I wish to see Dr. Carr. - Look. Oh! - What's he gonna do to her? (Katy screaming) - You hurt a great deal. It is a good sign. Pain means there is feeling. - So what do you think? - Well, there is no fracture of the spine. And the cause of the fever I suspect is inflammation of the spinal fluid. - Will she walk again? - We'll talk downstairs. (crickets chirping) (glass clinking) (drink pouring) - Will you have another? - Enough. You also. - You don't have to worry about me. - To neglect your own health is not going to help your child. - (laughs) Physician heal thyself, eh? I don't seem to be much use to anyone else. - Your family needs you. - Since my wife died, I... - I heard of your loss. I am sorry. But we cannot go back. - But what is the point of it? The ones I care for most, I fail. Ruth is dead. Her cousin's sick and now Katy's... I'm a doctor and yet I can do nothing. - You are only a doctor, not God. Every one of our patients will die at the end. We are all failures. - Is that it? You have an odd notion of reassurance, Professor. - I tell you, I can do very little for your daughter. - You're giving up on her? - No. I'll give what's in my power. Set the body straight. But you're her father. The rest is for you. (gentle music) - Well. How are you this morning? Did you do your exercises like the doctor said? Never mind. You have some visitors. Come along, you two. Come! Come on. In you go. There we are. Well, Katy. Here they are. - Oh, Katy. We've been so worried for you. The pastor says special prayers each Sunday and everyone's been asking after you. - That's nice, that everyone's been thinking of you. Well, I'm sure you have lots to talk about. (door bangs shut) - (whispers) Ned, come on. - You look real bad, Katy. - Ned! - Sorry. - You look fine, Katy. Only a bit pale. Like a princess. It's a shame you missed Zannah Clark's tea party. It was a proper, grownup affair with boys and all. Everybody wants to know how you're doing. How are you doing, Katy? It don't seem right to see you of all people stuck here. Does it, Ned? - Nope. I'm going off to college in a week. Can I write to you? All right. I will then. - Well, I promised Aunt Izzie we wouldn't stay long. (melancholy music) (door thuds shut) (crickets chirping) (Helen coughing) - How are you? - Can't sleep. You too? (Helen scoffs) (Helen coughing) - I'd forgotten the sound of these hot summer nights. (Helen coughs) - It was my fault. - Katy falling? - I promised Ruth I would take care of them. - And you do. You can't wrap them in cotton wool. Least of all Katy. (coughs) - I wasn't paying attention. - You are now and that's what counts. - Oh, Katy's in such pain. - I know. It's hard. - She's only a child. Her whole life to come. She may not... - Are you afraid she'll be crippled? - Yeah. Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that. But Katy... Always running and jumping. So carefree, full of life, full of energy. To see her lying there white and broken. That is terrible. - She'll never be the same. You mustn't expect that. Whatever happens. - Would you go to her? I think it would do her good to see you. (dramatic music) - Breaks my heart to think of Miss Katy laid up, her as bright as a sunbeam. - She's so grumpy now. - Is she going to be sick forever? - No, your daddy's gonna make her better. - Well, he didn't make Mother better, did he? - What a thing to say, Miss Elsie! When a person's time is up, they're called to God and that's that. - So he might call Katy, too? - No, he's not going to call Katy. - Why? Isn't she good enough? - Now, just stop it, please, all of you! - I hope Katy doesn't get better. - Dorry! - I only meant Aunt Izzie doesn't bother with us anymore. Can I have another pancake, Debbie? - Certainly not. You can go upstairs and make your bed at once, young man. Not bother, indeed. Fine chance of that. Aren't those breakfast trays ready yet, Debbie? Do I have to do every little thing around here? - Aunt Izzie, could I take up Cousin Helen's tray? - No. Your cousin is having breakfast with Katy this morning. I don't want any disasters. (Helen scoffs) - Of course, I'm under strict instructions to make sure you eat. How are you? - I can't move. It hurts all the time. - Mm-hmm. Pain's a monster that swallows you up and stops you from thinking or caring for anything else. But it doesn't have to win. You will get better. - My whole life is going by and I'm stuck in here. - Knowing you're here, other people will come to you. - I want to do things for myself. I don't want to have to live through other people. - Well, you can't live without them. Have you thought what that would be like? - This isn't any kind of life. - Well... It's what you make of it. - That's easy for you to say. You don't mind. - Don't I? (sighs) When I first found out I was ill, I was really angry. What had I done to deserve this? I was jealous and bitter and I wanted everyone to feel sorry for me. (sighs) But I was terrified of pity. So I ran away. - From here? - From everything that reminded me of what I couldn't have. And then a year later, your mother took ill and she begged me to come back, but I refused. I hurt her. I was so wrapped up in my own misery. I couldn't hear anything else. And by the time I understood that, it was too late. - Why are you telling me this? It has nothing to do with me! - I'm sorry, Katy. I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I did. - Well, I don't want to be like you. Don't want to be a cripple. - Nobody wants it. - I hate your life! - Then take hold of your own. - I'd rather die. - Oh, that's easy to say, isn't it? Just give up on life, it's not worth the trouble. (scoffs) I thought you were brave like your mother. I thought you had some fight in you. - I'm not like her! You don't know me at all. - No, I don't. This girl, who's happy to give in and give up, I don't know her at all. - I'm not listening! Just leave me alone. (crying) (gentle music) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) (rain falling) (gentle music) - Oh, missy! - What do you want? - Uh... Is she still poorly? - Mm-hmm. - Would you take her these flowers for me, please? I won't bite. Different slice of the pie you're from, eh? Bit more vinegar in the mix. - She's changed. You wouldn't recognize her. - That's too bad. Such a bright spark, it doesn't seem fair. - It should've been me, then no one would have minded so much. - Oh, I don't know about that. Seems to me you got a fair bit of spark in yourself as well. (birds singing) Now, will you take these flowers for me, please? Or do I have to stand here all day yarning? - I'll take them. (gentle music) I didn't mean to wake you. - I wasn't asleep. - Shall I? - Oh. Thank you. That's better. - Shall I sit with you for a while? - If you like. (bright music) - That man you found in the barn, he brought them. - They're lovely. - Will you try the soup? (gentle music) - Mm! This is good. What is it? - Squash and ginger. Not too spicy? - No, it's fine. Nice and warm. Mm. Did you make it yourself? So you can cook? What else can you do? - Tables up to 10. Eight jacks on a bounce. Flags of the world. Click my fingers. (snaps) - Like this. (snaps) - I can't do it as good as that. - Well, not yet. (dish clanks) I'm sorry I pushed you down the stairs that day. - You didn't. I mean, you didn't mean to, I just fell. - So are we quits? - Quits. (gentle music) - That soup was good. Is there more? - Sure. Debbie wants to fatten you up. (laughs) But Helen said not to pester you. Katy? - What else did she say? - Well, that you were sore all over. Not just your body, but your heart as well. And that you couldn't play or carry on like before because that stuff takes a long time to mend. - Hmm. - See, John and Dorry couldn't figure out why you were so crabby all the time. You're not crabby now, are you? - No. I think I've had about enough of that. (Elsie laughs) (bright music) (door clicks open) - Have you taken leave of your wits, Debbie? - No, Miss Carr. It's Miss Katy. She's eaten three biscuits already and she's asking for more. - Is she? Well, that is good. Still, no call to go plumb crazy. She'll be sick if she eats too much. - Very good, Miss Carr. - Do you like my dress? Cousin Helen gave it to me and nobody else ever weared it before. - Oh, it's lovely. - All right. Give your sister some air. It's time for her wash. (water pouring) - Katy, look! (Katy laughs) - You brushed your own hair, then? - I thought I'd try. - Fine mess you've made of it, to be sure. You can't rush things, Katy. - How is Cousin Helen? - Some days better. (water dripping) Did her good to know you were mending. - Did it? - Brought on that smile of hers. So take care of yourself for her sake. (door thuds shut) (gentle music) (owl hoots) Thumper? Thumper? (owl hooting) Hello? (suspenseful music) Who's there? I'll set the dog on ya! Oh. You frightened me half to death. - Set the dog on me? Poor old Thumper. - Well, you shouldn't go skulking about like that. What are you doing here? - Snow's coming. Been in the air all day. I'm just trying to get my head clear. - It's time you told her. - What if it sets her back? - She needs the truth. - She's only a child. - Not anymore. (dramatic music) - I'm not asleep. - How do you feel? - Not so bad. - You look better. - Father, I have to see Cousin Helen. I said some dreadful things to her and I have to say that I'm-- - You can't see her right now. - Well, then in the morning. I don't want to waste any time. It's important. - Now, Katy, your cousin... - What? What is it? - Helen's gone very far down this time. - [Katy] She's dying? - Yes, she's dying. That's why she's come here. To die at home with us, her family. - (sobs) But she can't die. She mustn't. I need her. Why? I don't understand, why do all the people we love have to die? - I don't know. Maybe they're just lent to us for a while. (owl hooting) (rumbling nearby) - Dorry? Is that you? (door creaks) (suspenseful music) I'll get help. - No! No, you've got to help me. Just help me up, please. No! No. Get the crutches, please. - I don't know. - Please, Elsie. (gentle music) - That's it! (Katy laughs) (knocking at door) - (weakly) Come, come in. (gentle music) Oh! (Katy sighs) I knew you could do it, Katy. Thank you, Elsie. - I thought you'd hate me. I never meant any of the things I said. - I know. I... I wanted to come to you. - Father, he told me. (Helen sighs) - We have so (sniffles) so much to talk about. - Do you need something Helen? Elsie, what are you doing? Katy Carr, you get... You're sitting up. You're sitting up! Philip! Philip! - Aunt Izzie was crying. - You see? Miracles do happen. - Elsie, help me up. (gentle music) - Oh, Katy. Oh! (bright music) Oh, Katy. (gentle music) - [Elsie] (laughing) Cover your eyes, Katy. (Katy laughs) (Izzie clears throat) Aunt Izzie! - Oh! (egg cracks) - What on earth? (children laugh) Katy Carr, what mischief are you up to? You don't fool me with your eyes tight closed. (children laughing) Elsie! Clean up this mess this instant. (door bangs shut) (children laughing) To tell the truth, Debbie, there hasn't been enough mischief in this house since Katy got sick. - I never thought to hear you say that, Miss Carr. - Well, no more did I. (Izzie laughs) ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ (all clapping) - Oh! Oh, lunch everybody! Katy, to your guests. - Cecy! How are you? - [Cecy] Good. - Ah. Ned! I haven't seen you in so long, you're almost a stranger. - Sorry, I had to study for my exams. - Ned's doing great at college. - Ah. And no uniform, I see. - Only freshman do that. You've changed, Katy. - You think so? - Well, I guess you're taller, that's it. - Guess I am. - (sighs) Sorry I never wrote. Real busy, you know? - I know. Cecy told me. - She did? - Will you stay for supper, Ned? - Uh, I promised the fellows that-- - But you said. - Well, merry Christmas anyhow. Come and see us again, won't you? - So long, Katy. - So long, Ned. - I don't know why he's being so stupid. Oh, he can be so sweet when he wants to. (gentle music) (Helen breathing shallowly) (piano playing) - [Katy] Does everybody know what we have to do? - We write a wish on the paper and throw it into the fire. - And if it goes up the chimney, Father Christmas will bring us what we wish for. - But it has to be a secret. You can't tell everyone or else it doesn't count, Dorry. - I shan't tell. Is it only one thing, Katy? - Only one thing. Or else how could Father Christmas give presents to all the children? - All right. - You ready? Come on. (playful music) Ready? It flew, it flew! - And mine, I saw it! - All right, Elsie. It's your turn. (gentle music) (Elsie sighs) - Never mind, you can write it on the back of mine. - Thanks. (paper rustling) (gentle music) (all laughing) (bright music) - [John] Merry Christmas everyone! (children laughing) - Whoa! - Yes! - (laughs) He came, huh, Katy? What did he bring? - Okay, Katy, Katy! - Is this for me? (children laughing) What is that, Elsie? - Look, Katy! Isn't it lovely? (all laughing) - I'm so glad you like it. - [Dorry] Chocolate! - Don't eat them all in one day, though. - Can I just have one? - I suppose, but make sure Aunt Izzie doesn't catch you. - What did you wish for, Katy? - It's a secret. - Katy. - Look what Father Christmas brought us! - Will you play with us, please? - Not right now. Katy, she wants to see you. - All right. - [John] Look at the game I got! We'll have so much fun. - [Elsie] What's Cecy brought us? - And I'll beat you, though. (dramatic music) (Katy cries) - I... I wished so hard you would be better. - Father Christmas is a friend of mine. He had to listen to my wish. - What did you wish for? - Time. To know you. Time to say goodbye. - But you can't leave me. - I don't want to go. - I love you. - I'm afraid. Hard to let go. (Katy shudders) - I'm here. (Katy shudders) (wind howling) (birds calling) (carriage rattling) (gentle music) (carriage rattling) (horse nickers) (birds calling) (gentle music) - Appreciate it, Michael. - Thank you. Come along. Wait over there. - I'm so sorry, Katy. - This isn't what she would have wanted at all. - (tuts) Poor Miss Carr. It's so distressing for you after all your troubles. When a life full of promise is cut short? You must all be very shocked. - [Izzie] We had known for some time. - Yes, yes, a tragic shadow over the family. Though she didn't always quite behave as one might have expected from a person in her condition. Mm, I hear she left quite a sum to Katy now. One would never have thought. - She wanted Katy to have some prospects. - Oh, my Cecy told me. College now, ain't it? (laughs) Well, that's all very nice, but a man doesn't like a girl to have too much education. - I'm sure we appreciate your kind thoughts, Mrs. Hall. - Why, think nothing of it, Dr. Carr. Why, I was just saying to Cecy yesterday, wasn't I dear? (children laughing and exclaiming) (gentle music) - Oh, Isabel, leave that. - It won't do itself, you know. (clock ticking) You did right to bring her here. - You think so? You know, you carried most of the weight. But perhaps it came right in the end. - [Izzie] More than that. - She's ready to go. - I wish Ruth could see her. She'd be so proud. - We all are. (gentle music) - I'll miss her. - So will I. (Izzie laughs) (gentle music) (dramatic music) (crutch clatters) (dramatic music)
