[Eliza] Can't nobody predict the future, you know? No matter how hard you try, it never turns out like you thought. You know? I just ain't built to work eight hours a day in a mill. [scoffs] Gotta pay the rent, though, so... give it a shot. Next thing you know, broke my damn back. They had me on all kinds of pills. 'Course, you need it, anything to make that pain go away. You just don't expect to get hooked. Can't never escape this shit. It's a tough spot. [exhales] The fuck am I tellin' you for? Sob stories is all the same. [Josie] I got oxy in 30 and 80s.

[Boots] Thank you, guys. For all of this. It's awesome. I just wish Dad was here to see it all. Don't say shit like that, man. Why not? Don't you ever wish he could see us-- 'Cause you don't know what you're talking about. [Boots] Yeah, I do. He was a good man. And he would've been proud of me. [chuckles] He wouldn't have given a shit. Yeah, he would! You don't know. Ya gotta forget about that old son of a bitch. -You mean like Ma did? -[Josie] Boots! Ya know what? Exactly like Ma did. She saw through his shit and got out the fuck out -while she still could. -Fuck that! She left us. Don't you fucking talk about things you don't know anything about, -all right, Boots? -I know plenty. Dad took care of this family! He gave us all a chance! What, while he was up at county? He was a fucking coward who shit all over the Conley name. He was a fuckin'-- Kip, wait! [groans and grunts] -[Josie] Kip! -[man] Hey! [Eve] Kip. -[Boots] Josie... -Shut up. That shit's on you. [Kip] You ain't supposed to see that. You ain't supposed to see anything like that. [Eve] Stop! You don't need to protect me. I ain't made o' glass, I can handle it. [Kip sighs] Maybe you just need a little space, ya know? I think things'll be better once you-- It's just that he doesn't remember the way it was. If he keeps pushing me like that, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm just about to snap and I-- -I know. I know. -[door opens] [Josie] Evie, you mind? Yeah. Of course. [sniffs] You gotta get that temper under control, or you're gonna put us all at risk. I'm not just talking about Boots. He was five. I know. We don't get to pick our heroes, ya know? [Kip] We're all he's got. Maybe we're sending him down the wrong path. We're doing the best we can. Like always. You two gonna be good? Of course. [Josie] Good. I gotta go see Clay. Use that ice. [country music playing] You called? Yeah. Thought you might wanna stop by and sing a little karaoke with me. What does he want? Come on, you think I know? ¶ Please don't let me Down, down this road ¶ [Gonzo] You're welcome. Clay. Josephine. Quite the view you got. Don't be sarcastic. Jesus. Doesn't sound good on a lady. [groans] Look. Alleyways. Parking lots. That's where it all goes down. You wouldn't believe the shit that's down there in those dumpsters. Take your word for it. I'm late for the game. What's up? I been hearing about dead bodies in my bathroom. You know anything about that? -Sure don't. -You think this kinda shit is just gonna go away? You got a problem, and you'd better take care of it. Any problems I got are your problems too. I own a bar, sweetheart. And it's about time you know that's it for me. -Don't you understand that? -Fuckin' coward. [Clay] Oh, please. I quit all that shit when your dad got locked up. [sighs] You better watch yourself. [scoffs] You threatening me? I'd never threaten a Conley. You're all too fuckin' proud. -[Josie] Damn right. -[laughs] I should yank that fuckin' tube right outta your fuckin' nose. [Clay] Well, you'd be doin' me a favor, ma'am. Get out of my bar. [door slams] [clicks] [saw whirring] [indistinct chatter] [saw whirring] [indistinct chatter] Conley, you motherfucker! Goddamn, you got a lot a nerve showin' up here.

Get your fuckin' hands off me! You're poison! You and your whole goddamn family did this, and I ain't gonna fuckin' forget it! Get the fuck off me. [indistinct chatter] -[curtains rattle] -[Boots groans] [Josie] Get your ass up. Day's half over, man. [Boots groans] Fuck off. [Josie] Get up. Unbelievable. [door closes] [Kip] Where's Josie? [Boots] In the office. [bottles clink] Hey! Are we good? Yeah. Always. Hey, can I come in there with you guys? -[Kip] No. -How am I supposed to-- [door closes] [Josie] You ought to let him in here. He's not gonna be able to learn otherwise. [pills rattle] What? What happened with Ted Wallace's wife? Didn't have anything to do with me. That's not what Ted Wallace thinks. Yeah, well, what she does in her own private time is her business. Listen. This stuff is here either way. The only thing that makes a difference is who makes the money. [bag zips] [door closes] [clattering] [clanks] [Boots] What the hell are we doin' here, man? [Kip] Waitin'. Ain't you never waited for nothin' before? [Boots] Well, what are we waitin' for? I want you to meet someone is all. Yeah, who? He served two tours a couple years before me. He's a war hero? Just because ya fight in a war, don't make you a hero, man. [Boots] Yeah, it does. Don't talk about shit you don't know nothin' about, Boots. Hey, you fought for your country. You killed terrorists. I don't care, you're a hero to me. I laid on rooftops and shot at people who didn't even know I was there. That ain't being a fuckin' hero, man. [Packard] Hey, hey, hey, man, who's this guy? That's my brother, Boots. Boots, I want you to meet Packard. How you doin', man? [Packard] Hey, you know, it is what it is, y'know? Yeah. Here. Oh, man. Hey, I know it's not much-- No, no, no. You keep that. You take care of yourself. Take care of that woman too. Of course, man. We're gonna do that. Yeah. All right, man. Hey, your brother, man. He's a good man, best I ever knew. [Kip] Come on, Boots. [Boots] Hey, what was that all about? You skimming off the top for that guy? Two pills every run. Does Josie know? What you think? [car door closes] Why are you showing me this, man? [sighs] I know you've been meeting up with people. Trying to make moves. Come on, man, it's nothing. It's-- It's... You need to kill it. No, man. I'm not gonna fucking kill it. Fuck! I'm trying to look out for you, all right? You don't need this shit. This shit is what we do, man. There ain't nothin' else for me. Just fucking kill it. You hear me? Yeah. Whatever. [car engine starts] [Boots] Is it really that bad? [Cooper] You think this is boring? You should come visit me in Tisdale. -I'll show you boring. -[Boots chuckles] Yeah. So, you, uh... you talk to your brother yet? You sure you wanna mess with this, man? Yes. Fuckin' yeah, I am. I ain't just gonna sit around with my dick in my hand all day. I gotta fuckin' make shit happen. All right! Fine. He's, um... He's got a guy. He sells other shit, but no oxy. No pills. Not yet. His name's Marcus. Marcus. All right. -[Cooper] The only thing, man... -What? It's gotta be quite a lot. Make it worth it and everything. Okay. Yeah. I can get as much as his ass can pay for. -Yeah? -Yeah. [crowd cheering] [whistle blows] [man] Blue 45. Blue 45, hut-hut! [grunting] [crowd cheering] [phone beeps] [crowd cheering] -Later, Jimmy. -[Jimmy] Thanks. [crowd cheering] Oh, shit.

[crowd cheering] [man] Ten-hut! [crowd cheering] [woman] That was amazing. [Sheriff Knox] Somethin' on your mind? No. Nah. Just, um... You and me? We're, um, still good? Still maintaining our delicate balance? Is that what this is? A delicate balance? So long as I don't see anything I don't wanna see. I know. Of course. You take care, Kyle. You made a choice, Jo. You don't have to do this. [chuckles] Some choice I have, huh? I always forget how quiet it gets out here. Yeah. It's too quiet. You can hear yourself think. When was the last time you slept a full night? 2009. [chuckles, sniffs] How do you do it? How do you shut it all up? Shut what up? People. The... I mean, all of your sins, just... Just waitin' for a chance... so that they can pop back up and remind you. [Josie] Well... [sighs] One of us ought to get some sleep at least. [sniffs] Hey. Are we any different than Dad? We're doing what we need to do to get by. No different than anyone else. Can I get ya anything? -Nope. -[whispers] All right. Good night. [door closes] [woman on TV] This plant-- The herbs are gonna need the same kind of plant in a pot. Three to four in a pot depending on their roots. This is French thyme. [man on TV] Now, what's-- What's French thyme? [woman on TV] Uh, French thyme is what you would call a mother thyme, and it grows... [door creaks] [car engines shuts off] -Sup, brother? -[Cooper] 'Sup, man. So, you're the kid, huh? You must be Marcus. Got the money? [Cooper] All right. Cooper, come here. What? -[Ryan] Get in the car. -[Cooper] Why? [Ryan] Because this isn't your deal anymore. -Get in the car. -[Cooper] Boots? This is my deal. What the hell! Ryan! This is my deal! [Marcus] It's all good, man. It's all good. [Cooper] Fuck you! [Ryan] Get your ass in the car, boy. [Cooper] Ryan, what the hell? [Boots] All right, then. That's all there is to it. -Ryan, what the fuck? -[gun cocks] [Boots] What the fuck? Hey, man... -[Cooper] Ryan! -Pathetic. -[Cooper] Ryan! What the fuck? -[breathes heavily] You got no idea who you're fucking with. Hey, just leave him. -Is that right? -[Cooper] Boots! I know your face, man. You're fucked. [Ryan] Fuck this, man. Come on. Let's go! [Boots] You steal from the Conleys? We'll turn you inside out and take back what's ours. [Ryan] Marcus. [breathes heavily] You're a lot dumber than I thought, Conley. Come on, Marcus! Let's go! Hey. Wait. I-- You said it. You're not giving me much of a choice. -[Boots] I didn't mean it-- -[gunshot] [groans] [gunshot] [gunshots] [Cooper] What the fuck is happening? Ryan! -[Ryan] Fuck this. -[Cooper] Ryan! [gunshots] -[Ryan groans] -Ryan! [gunshots] [car engine starts] [gunshot] [Boots breathes heavily] [Kip] That all of 'em? Kip! That all of 'em? Yeah. [Kip] Come on, you gotta help me with this. We gotta move. Kip, this shit's real. I didn't know... I didn't know that they would do that. Hey, shut the fuck up, or I'll bury you right next to the rest of these motherfuckers. You gonna help me or what? [car engine revving] [sniffs] [Josie] Got all the pills? Yup. And you cleaned it all up? Yup. You need to eat somethin'. Two kids are dead, Josie. [utensils clatter] What happened out there... was awful. But all the more reason why we can't just walk away. We can do this together. [Kip] Josie... promise me something. Protecting this family comes first. When it's time to quit, we quit. No questions asked. -Of course. -[Kip] Promise me. No questions asked. We're all in this together. [Boots] What are we doin' here? What's going on? What's my car doing here? Someone could've seen it, Boots. There's way too much on the line. -You gotta be smarter. -[Boots] Wait! Josie, what the fuck! Come on. Hey, look. I know I messed up. You wanted to be part of this? This ain't a kid's game. The world's a cold, ruthless bitch. I can't afford for you not to understand that. -Look, I didn't mean-- -It's never just you, Boots. You doing this ain't gonna make me learn better or anything. Oh, I'm not gonna do anything. You're a big man now. You can clean up your own shit. Show us you're ready for this. -No evidence gets left behind. -[lighter clicks] [Boots sniffs] Josie, I'm sorry. Josie, I'm sorry! [door slams] [car engine starts] [shop bell rings] -[Josie] Hey. -[Eve gasps] Hey! Kip, uh, asked me to swing this by. [Eve] More baby stuff? That was sweet of ya. [Josie] So, um... you and Kip been lookin' at houses at all? Yeah, a bit. I think we're gonna look at some more this week. All here in town, I hope. Oh, yeah, we ain't gonna go far. Good. Because I still need him. Yeah. Course. All right. See ya around. Yeah. [shop bell rings] [car door closes] [Boots sighs] So, what do you want me to do? [Kip] Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. Then what's the point of me even bein' here-- [Kip] If it were up to me, you wouldn't be here. Yeah, well... [Kip sniffs, sighs] [Kip] Here we go. [car engine starts] Stay here and watch. What the fuck is this? Who the fuck are you? Just give me the fucking money. Yeah, that's not gonna be enough. Fuck you, man. You're done. You son of a fucking bitch, I'm gonna get you for this. [Duane] Don't fucking walk away from me. [gun cocks] Really? Is this it? This is what you wanna do? -[car door opens] -Yo, what's going on? [Kip] Get back in the car, Boots! [Scrapper] What the fuck are you doing, man? Who the fuck are you? [Kip] Hey, calm down, that's my brother. He's gonna get you some more money, all right? -Just calm down. -[Scrapper] Yeah? -Well, come on then! -Boots, in the glove compartment, there's more cash. Just bring it to me, all right? [Scrapper] Well, come on then! [Kip] Fucking calm down. [Duane] The fuck is he doin'? Hey, hurry up! [Duane] Come on, let's go! [sighs] I'm just gonna go back and get it, all right? [Duane] Slow. [Kip] Get back in the fucking car. [Duane] Slowly. Grab the money. [Scrapper] Come on. Let's get the fuck outta here. Come on, man, let's go. Fuck! Fuck! Get in the fucking car! -[engine starts] -Fuck! [tires screech] [sirens blares] You're good. Just be smart. What the hell is going on? -[Kip] What do you think? -[Sheriff Knox] Evening, y'all. Quite a scene you're causing, Kyle. Wanna come inside? [indistinct radio chatter] I'm fine out here. How ya doin', Boots? [Josie] You wanna tell us what's going on? I don't know if y'all heard, but a few kids went missing up in Tisdale a few days back. Local boys are on the case. They followed some tire tracks into the woods and found a piñata of shell casings. Multiple weapons. One of which was a .308. Y'all wouldn't know anyone else around here with that kind of hardware, would ya? Afraid we can't help you. None of us ever go up to Tisdale. Yeah, see, that's just it. This wasn't up in Tisdale. This was just past the river. Right here in Bates County. You listen to me closely. I can't stand by and just let this happen. Don't be stupid. We have leads. We have witnesses. And we're closing in on this thing fast. Good luck finding that rifle, Knox. Y'all have a good night. [takes deep breath] [car door closes] [car engine starts] [car pulls away] [breathes heavily] -How'd the buy go? -They fucked us. Assholes nearly shot us both. -[Kip] Josie! -They what? That's it. It's over. What are you talking about? I'm done. We're done. Excuse me? You don't get to say when-- You said that when we needed to, we'd stop. This is that time. -That's-- -No questions asked, right? Don't tear this apart, Kip. Wake up, Josie! We got cops knockin' on our doors, Boots just had a gun to his head. Hey, don't fucking talk about me like I ain't here! I can't go into a bar without somebody trying -to kick my head in! -That's bullshit! I will not put this family in any more danger. You wanna keep the Conleys together, then we stop this shit right now. Without the dope, there are no fucking Conleys! Don't you fucking get it? Or are you gonna put your girl through college by chopping fucking wood? This gave you everything. It's who we are. And I'm not gonna quit just 'cause you're getting scared. I will fix it. Knox, Cooper, all of it. -I will fix it. -You're just like him. Just like him. [Josie] Kip, wait! Kip, I can fix it! [Boots] This is so fucked. This needs to be sorted and bagged right away. -Are you a part of this or not? -Yeah. -Where you goin'? -[door closes] [Kip] Hey, what's up, man? [Gonzo] Hey, man. [clears throat] You, uh, want me to go wipe down the booth for ya? [Kip] No. No. I'm not working, man. I'm just here for a little clarity. Clarity, huh? We like to keep most of our clarity in the bottom of the glass. [Kip] That's what I hear. Rocks or straight up? [Kip] Straight up. [Gonzo] You let me know if you need anything else. [Kip] All right. Thanks, brother. [Ted] You ain't welcome here. I got no business with you, brother. -[Gonzo] Hey, Ted-- -[Ted] Shut up! [bangs chair] Come on, man. Fuckin' coward! Hey, you better calm down, all right? Calm down! [clattering] She was everything to me. -Look at me, you fuckin'-- -[glass shatters] [Clay] Not in my bar! You know what this man did! [Clay] Not in my bar ever. We'll take care of your tab for tonight already. You go on home. I hope you get to feel just an ounce of the pain you've poured into this town. 'Cuz it will fucking eat you up. [Clay] You're lucky I was here to save your ass. What do you want, old man? What do I want? Hmm. When I was a little kid, we were playin' behind my house one day. Little kid named Jimmie Mooney... he got bit by a snake. Right here on the vein. And we didn't tell my mom. We knew goddamn well that we'd get in trouble. Well, that venom traveled real fast through Jimmie's body. And a few hours later... he died on my porch. Well, I'm sorry for your loss. [Clay] Yeah. Hear me. That venom is in you. It's in all o' you. And it's spreading. Deputies came in here asking about you. They're probably questioning that knocked up girlfriend of yours right now. And you got a decision to make. Are you willing to cut off an arm to save the body? [shop bell rings] [knocking on door] [Cooper] Josie. -[Josie] Hey, Coop. -What are you doing here? Can we talk? I'm... I'm really sorry. It's godawful. Losing a brother. And like that? Look, me and Boots, we never meant to cause you any kind of trouble, or-- [Josie] I know. Your brother... Your brother was just in with some really bad people. And they caught wind of a deal. I... I really appreciate you coming out here. I was fucking terrified that you'd-- We got you burned and that you'd never wanna-- [Josie] Listen. They were shooting at my brother too. Remember? It's a miracle you two got outta there. I don't advocate for this much. But... you and I are both going through some shit right now. [sighs] If ever two people deserved to... unplug for a second, it's... you and me right now. You with me? You done that before? No, I saw my brother do it a few times. [Josie] Feel so good in a minute. [sighs] [Cooper] Fuck. [chuckles] Yeah. [sighs] I'm glad you got outta there, man. [Cooper exhales] You're a good kid. You don't deserve to go down in your brother's mess. Have the cops been calling around here at all? Huh? The cops? They're gonna try to hang this on somebody. [sniffs] Maybe you. Maybe Boots. Maybe even me. [lighter clicks] Gotta make sure we don't get burnt. [Josie] They ask you any questions or anything? [Cooper] Hmm. Sure. When Mom first caught wind that they were missin'. [sighs] But I-- I was a mess. I couldn't-- I couldn't say a thing. [Cooper sighs] But the... The Bates County guy, he called yesterday... wanted to... ask some questions of his own, I guess. Yeah? [exhales] Is that... Is that-- Is that okay? -Should I be worried? -No. Nothing for you to worry about. -Just, here. -[Cooper] Wait, wait. -That's for you to-- -[Josie] Hold still. [phone rings] [phone rings] [Boots panting] [sniffs] [keys jingle] [sobs] [sirens wailing] [Boots panting] [Josie sniffs] [Jack] ...and I sat there, stared at it, but I know I couldn't do it, ya know? I just thought about my kids... and so I'm here today. [moderator] Thank you for sharing, Jack. [all] Thank you, Jack. Anybody else like to share? [Sheriff Knox] I'd like to share. [moderator] Okay, great, Kyle. Go ahead. [Sheriff Knox] I'm Kyle, I'm an alcoholic. [all] Hey, Kyle. [Sheriff Knox] I had a bad day yesterday... and I was tempted, um... I was alone. My wife went to her mother's. There was an argument about work. Things there have been kinda rough lately. Ya know, people you trust can let you down sometimes. Anyway... when she left, there it was. Sittin' there, waiting for me-- [door closes] [moderator] Sorry. Go on, Kyle. [Sheriff Knox] Hey. You know, it helps if you stay the whole time. You all right? Sorry about Breanne. That cunt. [laughs] Here we are again. Two fuckups in the same parking lot. You think we're going to be doing this in 30 years too, hmm? Like two broken pieces of pottery... [sighs] ...sitting in some shitty, old cabinet. No idea what you're talking about. Why do we do it, Jo? I'm sorry. Why? I really, really am. [sobs] Wait, wait. [both panting] I can't. [grunts] -[Sheriff Knox] Jo-- -Fuck off. [engine starts] [inaudible] [shop bell rings] [Eve] Kip. Fuck! Kip, honey, you need to calm down. Let's go back inside. Come back in and talk to your brother, all right? Kip. Kip. Kip, wait! I don't know what you got in your head, but don't you go doin' nothin' you can't come back from, ya hear me? [indistinct chatter] [glass clatters] What exactly do you think you're doing? I asked you a fuckin' question, boy. [sighs] This one's for you. What the fuck you want, Conley? Repentance. [Eve] You, uh... You want a pop or something? I got some extra here. Here ya go. Thanks. Let me clean you up a bit. Help us take our mind off things. What do you say? Come on, I ain't gonna hurt ya. [exhales] [Kip groans] Fuck! -[thudding] -[grunting] [phone vibrates] -Yeah. -[Kip] Jo. I'm at the mill. I need your help. I tried to fix things and it got... messy. Please hurry. [tires screeching] Look at that. We got quite the man on our hands. [chuckles] You were right, ya know. Your father'd be proud of you. Yeah. [keys jingle] [door squeaks] [clattering] [Josie] Kip? Kip? [rats squeaking] [Josie exhales] [whispering] Kip. [Kip] Josie. [Josie] Kip, what the fuck is going-- [thud] [thud] [car engine starts] [tires screeching] [dog barking] [door opens] [phone ringing] [operator] 911, what's your emergency? [Kip] I'd like to report an incident... over at the mill on Highway Nine. [knocking on door] [indistinct chatter on radio] [vehicle approaches] [car door opens] [Sheriff Knox] Kip. Sheriff. [sighs] What happened to you? [exhales] I'm all right. I suppose you heard. I don't have a whole lot of information just yet, but... Sorry-- I don't need you to talk, Sheriff. [Sheriff Knox] Understood. Just listen. Excuse me? [Kip] No doubt you'll search her truck. When you do, you're gonna find that .308 you've been looking for. And I'm guessing that the casings gonna match the bullets found in them poor Tisdale boys. She was a determined woman, Sheriff. I'm gonna have to bury my sister. And when I do, I... I'd like to bury this whole Conley business along with her. I don't think it's going to be that simple, Kip. Yeah. It is. Last thing we want is your wife and kid knowing that you liked to fuck the local oxy dealer. Right? You're a good man, Kyle. You always have been. But that don't mean you don't do bad things sometimes. I just don't see a reason to hang you for it is all. Do you? All right. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go see my little brother. [indistinct chatter] -Take her for a minute? -[Kip] Sure. Oh, so cute. -[chuckles] -She don't sleep. [Gonzo] She did good today, man. Real good. Didn't cry or nothing. She's a tough cookie. She takes after her mother that way. [Gonzo] Oh, yeah. [baby coos] So, uh, how you guys gettin' by? I mean, she's cute as hell, but... it ain't cheap having a kid. You, uh, really put all that away? Got to. Mm. We get by. Eve says that the salon's doin' real good. And the little bit extra from the mill. Just day by day, brother. Yeah. [bottles clink] [Boots] You're fuckin' late. Yeah, I-- I'm sorry. I just... Here. So that'll hold you, yeah? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And? Well, uh, yeah, yeah, Kip doesn't-- Yeah, well, Kip ain't here. Is he?
