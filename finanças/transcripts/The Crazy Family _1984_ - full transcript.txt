Wrong, mom! Don't slip downwards there. I didn't slip. - That's how it goes. Hey! We'll see it shortly. What? Where? Where? Which one is it? There! - What, there already? That was fast. Erika! This one there! That's it! What? That's it? Awesome! Careful! Whereto? That's right! Oh, sorry. Yeah, right! Yeah, put this one there. Be Careful! Look, you mover! Look, what Erika is doing. The Barbells are very heavy. But Erika is strong. For gods sake! Be careful! That table was expensive! Great! Great! Erika is so happy. She is so happy, little Erika! Now I know. There! There! Beautiful, ain't it? Although it isn't big. We finally did it. Dad? - What is it? Please turn out the light and close your eyes, until I allow you to open them again. Why? - Don't ask. Rather do it! Yeah. All right. Don't open your eyes yet. Wait a bit longer. Not yet! Now: Light on, Eyes open! We thank our father for the beautiful house! Sadly I don't have anything for you, but therefore you got your wife for you alone now! Here, your present! Take it! The children live on their own now. November 2nd. Blithe. Today we finally moved into the new house. Kazukuni Kobayashi is now a house owner. Now it finally came true. The family luck has always been my biggest wish. This day and this joy I'll therefore remember my whole live. My whole family looks happy too. Until now I couldn't afford to have a house like that for my family. That's why I felt like a loser. All my family members are infected by that sickness. That's my big suffering, that my wife, Masaki and Erika suffer from that sickness. Yesterday we got out of the inhuman urban area. That's why I think this sickness will soon better itself. Our surrounding has gotten a lot prettier now too. Now it all depends on me having enough strength. It all depends on my strength. Well I gotta go then. Good-Bye! Good-Bye! - Good-Bye! - Wait! Wait for me! Quick, hurry up! Take little Erika with you! Or she will be late! Oh, Get on! Hold on tight! Here we go! - Yes. Good. How was it? - What? Did you sleep well in our new house? Yes, at best, Dad! Little Erika loves you! So you slept well. Good. You got your own room now after all! Now you just need to get rid of your exaggerated childhood language. A stranger probably wouldn't think it is funny. No that's not true. People like that. Everybody is saying: She's talking so cute. Tut! "Cute". I think they are all mocking you. Just talk a little bit more straight! Erika is talking straight. Buh! Children, children, children! What is it with you? You look bad, children! Mhm? I see, your still tired from moving. Just a second, OK? You'll get some fresh water right away! Don't you want too? And now a new exercise! Dad, have you gone insane? What are you doing? What is it? Common help me. - Very well then! Whoops! Come. Heel! Inumaro! Hey, come here. Starting today I'll call you Inumaro Kobayashi. You, what are you doing here? Get lost! Drop it! Or you'll get punished. This is a sacred dog. Fate has brought us together. That's why I gave him that name. I am going to raise him! Raise? Does that mean you feed him and take him for a walk? Yes, yes, I'm gonna do that. I see. So, if u don't want to, you don't have to go to university by force. You can also become a dog parlor owner. or a stockman in the zoo. Or you can go on a safari. Whatever makes you happy! To university by force? I am doing what I want. What are you talking there? All right then. Kill the white ant, or she'll destroy your house! A white ant! Where did he get it from? Yes! Kill! Kill! Dad, Erika suffocates! This wasn't for amusement. It was just one single white ant, wasn't it? Don't you think you are exaggerating? I think, that was enough. Was this really a white ant? They slowly get used to the new life. Hope gradually has increased too. But we still may not be careless. Yes! The child is great! Very good, Grandpa, isn't it? Grandpa is enthused. Saeko was right. You're singing is great. Good, starting from now I'm gonna be your manager. Honestly? Really? - Yes. Awesome! That I even have a manager before my debut, that's crazy! But Erika doesn't know for sure yet, If she'd rather become a singer or a catcher. Which do u like more? Both is OK. Erika is the Superstar of the future. But Dad, don't say something like that I know what I am doing. Grandpa deliberately took the express train, to be here early. Therefore he's still fit, isn't he? No! The family head drinks first! Grandpa brought fish roes for us from the homeland. You missed that a lot, eh? Kazukuni, You made it. - What? I'm talking about the house. Now everything is going to be fine. For your measures you achieved a lot. It's just a bit cramped here. Oh, but that doesn't matter. Well, now you did it! Well done. Did you really get a look at everything? I did! I looked around everywhere. I've seen every angle. I even took a look into the toilet bowl. Congratulations! Masaki is missing! Doesn't matter, does it? We'll start anyways. Grandpa! Oh, that looks delicious! Saeko, really, don't make yourself too many inconveniences! Oh, I don't mind. Oh, Sushi! Oh, that looks great! Oh, um, grandpa? - Yes? Erika's gonna give you her tekamaki and so you're gonna give her your shrimps. Yeah, OK, the shrimps. - Erika! I'm gonna give u ginger and you're gonna give me your tuna. No that won't work! So Erika's gonna give you radish and you're gonna give her you're baked egg. Yes! There! Oh no! That's disgusting! Ah there you finally are! Hurry, or there won't be any sushi left. That's Masaki. Man you've grown a lot! You're walk took quite long? Have you been far away? Enjoy your meal. Going out on the street while listening to music is dangerous! So, here! This isn't music. It's english-lesson. You're even learning while taking a walk? That's exemplary! Masaki, you know what you are? You're a real sprinter! Maybe I am a sprinter, but one, who has to catch up a lot, haven't you, Masaki? Why that? Brother has flunked university once already. Keep quiet! Oh. But you have time to prepare yourself. And which university do u want to go too? Yeah, there's only one, Tokyo-University. Wonderful! That's aiming at the right goal. That's the task of a real man. There's nothing else. You inherited you're face and you're figure from your father. He looked like you then Your intelligence however stems from me. From my Blood. And when I was your age then, I was just as smart as you. That's right, isn't it? Today was a beautiful day. I didn't have such an amusing conversation in a long time. Really. Masaki and Erika both have grown so much. I like them both so much. As far as I know my brother has children the same age. I didn't feel comfortable there. Was there any trouble at my brothers'? What? That means you've thrown him out? But that isn't OK, Brother. You couldn't endure it any longer? Well, just... Don't forget all he has done for us. Hit it to the goal! Come on hit it. Hit it! - Now come on, come on! Don't make yourself nervous! Now I want to see a really good hit. What are you waiting for? Your stance is already good. - This is going to be a perfect shot. I want to see this. Saeko, you're a genius! Believe me. Done! Wasn't that something? Oh, you are already back. We are out of beer. Besides we don't have any snacks at all Do that please! Do you have something ready yet? You, um... What? He will be staying here forever? But we don't have a room for him. Talk about it again with your brother! Who is next now? He thinks he's always staying with us. Saeko, it's your turn again. Come on over! come on over! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Now it'll start for real! Now it's getting hot here! Have you gone crazy? In front of all these people! Dad, we slowly have to! Oh, Kuzukuni, you trained your wife pretty well. Masaki is learning upstairs! Oh! Well then it's time for him to pause! Today is a day that is only for celebration! Everybody has to party with us! Did You teach her that? No! For gods sake! What are you talking? Well, I don't know. Don't you want to join me? Bah, I see, you're a chicken. Stop it! Stop it! Thank you, thank you. Dad, I urgently have to discuss something with you urgently! Good Night! - Listen! Grandpa is asleep. Let's have dinner now! Call mom! Look at mom. Are you sick? I find it really terrible seeing something like that. Dad, don't you notice that terrible smell? It stinks here! It stinks here! If it will continue stinking like that Erika will perish. She is already. I gotta puke soon, really! Masaki! What do you want? I know, it has been really noisy today. It probably did disturb you? No, I still did it, my whole pensum! lt'll soon be time to take your dog Inumaro for a walk. Grandpa been walking around with him all day. Now he is totally exhausted and sleeping. That's why I had enough time to study. Sitting inside ones room all day isn't healthy either. I'll soon have exams, I got to persevere. There's nothing else left for me. It doesn't work like that. I have to do something. The symptoms of their sickness aren't getting better, they even get worse! I have to do something! Do it! - Come on! Throw it! Good, I will throw it. You think you can catch it? I'm an old man, I can't throw that far anymore. Come a bit closer! Further, further! So, stripling! Just come! Heaven's judgement. Old geezer! I'm sorry, little one! Company, at ease! Are you still fit, dad!? It hasn't yet come that far You can't yet beat your dead. Yes, what a nice view! You're intricateness hasn't changed at all. If u want to talk to me, then just say it right in my face! Yes. Well then. Dad, say, what do you think about my family? What do you mean? Did you ever recognise something abnormal? Well yeah. If you ask me like that, they are a bit escalated. They are. They all have become a bit strange. Yes, to be honest, they all have the Civilisation-Sickness, some kind of neurosis I think. If that's the case, we should call a doctor and admit them into a lunatic asylum. That's nonsense! Todays doctors are so irresponsible, I can't intrust my wife and my two children to them. I only can cure my family with my love. Calm, keep calm! You don't have to trouble yourself like that. I know. Kazukuni, honestly tell me, tell me please. Am I in your way, living at your house? No. That you are here with me is ok. I'm glad about that. Just if u keep behaving like that, so reckless, the chance exists, I'm afraid, that the sickness of my family is getting worse. That's why u have to change. Behave more according to your age. I see. You don't have to say anything else. Everything is clear for me! I will assist you with your endeavours. Dad, come over please! Which one is it? Mine? First Erika thought too he is a funny grandpa. But he smells so much. He smells like incense, he smells old. That disgusts me, that's so gross! Besides mom shall not sleep in Erika's room all the time. She uses all of Erika's make-up. What's that? I don't even touch it. No you're using it! And do you know, what's even dumber. Erika can't do her singing-training anymore and np acting-exercises. The most important thing for Erika. So, what are we gonna do about it? I guess there's no way out. Or do you know a way? So, where am I supposed to sleep now? Out there in the doghouse? OK! I can just sleep together with Inumaro. But you have to feed us well. As a quadruped I am going to eat a lot. Common! Stop it! Dad! What are you planning to do? That's not much. But you can buy a small thing for Masaki and Erika with it. Please take it. what does that mean? Do you want to...? I don't like giving someone money. By a dictionary instead and a few notes! Put a nice favor on it and give it to them. And I cause a real lot of trouble to Saeko. I know I can hardly make up for that. Give this lucky charm to her. It is for the whole family. What happened to you? Are you going back to my brother? No! I don't want to be there. I'm not going back there. But than you don't have anybody you can go to. Take your luggage down for now! No. No, don't worry about me! I'm used to sleeping outdoor. You know, five or six years ago I did a bike-tour across Japan. And now I m gonna do one by foot. That's still an adventure. A piece of romanticism. Please stop that nonsense. Sit down! Sit down! Watch it! Be careful! Don't move! You hear? Saeko! Erika! Grandpa wants to move out? What are we going to do? Oh, I just remember, tonight I wanted to cook something really nice for you and I'm missing some ingredients. I have to hurry and go shopping. Near Grandpa it stinks too much, That's why I will go shopping with my mom. Do you really want to accept this? Good-bye! Masaki! What happened to you? You are bleeding. I worked through the night. And when I'm getting tired I do this. In such a tough situation I actually shouldn't disturb you. But we have to talk about something serious. Please don't disturb me anyways, if it is somehow possible. Grandpa wants to move out and is making a big fuss about it. But we don't have a room for him. That's why I thought about building something for him in the yard. But I wanted your affirmation for that. And what are we going to do with Inamuro? Yeah that's it. I thought, maybe we could give him to an animal shelter for now. Does that mean Grandpa is moving into the doghouse? Nonsense! Good, so that means I'm going to feed grandpa, put a collar around his neck and take him for a walk. Is that how it was meant? Stop that nonsense! OK! OK! I build that kennel and I build it for a dog. But if u want to, you can destroy the kennel. It is your yard and your house. You can do what you want, if that's how it goes. I'd actually be thankful to you, very thankful, if you wouldn't bother me. Did you understand? Yes, yes! Understand. Kazukuni, it'll be best if I... I got it! Yes. A whole! We dig a whole! A basement. And that we are going to make into another room. At last that's my property, my house. Nobody can say anything against that. That's the way to victory! That's your best idea until now! Dad! - What? This will be your own room! So take especially much care! No problem for me. I'm gonna do that. That can't be. What's this here? Have you gone insane? That's the plan. We are building a room here. For grandpa. I thought at you too when doing that. From now on you won't be disturbed anymore. The solution. A good solution, I think. So? And where are we going to have dinner tonight? Our dining room, where is it now? What am I going to do with all those things? Finally I had a big kitchen. That's why I used my savings and bought all those beautiful things to cook for you. Why are you doing something like that? Don't worry! No problem! lt'll be right done. You can watch us in the meantime, if u want. And you too. And Masaki, now we don't need to destroy your doghouse too. I don't care about all that. I just want to have my privacy. I really feel happy again. - We'll be done in no time. Kazukuni, don't pause! Hang on! Masaki! Masaki! Your midnight meal is ready! No, no. I don't want it. No, I said no! Who is there? - Dad is here. Come in. Oh, dad. What's going on? Today you are sooo late! Oh, no! What do you want? Why don't you let your mother in? I really feel sorry for her. I already told you. If she hangs around her, I can't concentrate on my acting-exercises Didn't I make that clear? Sure, sure. But the next night she'll be sleeping here again, understood? Oh, cut the crap! After all it isn't my fault that she has no room, is it? Their symptoms have become a lot worse. There's not much time left. I have to finish my job as fast as possible. My proud creation! Casserole! Oh. Super. Dad? Why aren't you at work at this time? That's a crazy tool you bought there. What's that supposed to be? We'll progress a lot faster with this. Great! Totally great, Kazukuni Super. You're really super. Dad! Dad! Stop it! Stop that! Stop it! Stop it right now, you maniac! Oh, you could help me. Would be a good alternation for you. Dad, stop it dad, stop it! Such a maniac! Fucking maniac! Dad, look! Here! How about this? Come! Please, finally stop it! Dying means sixty. Dying means aggrieving. Dying means not losing ones pride. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. It tastes good! It tastes good, tastes good. Hang on! Just hang on! Just stay calm and hang on! Hang on! Here they are! Here they are! White ants! White ants! - White ants! And now? Insecticide! Quick, get me some! Insecticide. Understood. Those damn insects. Fucking insects. Fucking insects. - Here! Fucking insects. Here! - Fucking insects. I'm gonna get you all! Breathe that, you beasts! I'm gonna get you all! Fire! Fire! It's burning somewhere! Come out of there! Dad? What's that? Dad, where are the white ants? Dad, where are they? There is a whole nest. You found an ant nest. White ants! Fucking insects. Quick, give me fire! Fire? - Bring Fire! Why are you moving so slowly? Fucking insects! Hey! Fire? Quick, the fire! Quick! Here you have fire! Here! Here! Here you got gasoline! Yes, good. Gasoline. Thanks. Kazukuni! - Yes! Gods Fire! Yes! Gimme. Goods fire is good. Now water! Water! Bring it! Quick! Water! Water! Now he needs Water! Hey! Where's the water? Wait. I'm coming. - Wait! Here you got water! Hurry up! - Dad, hang on! Hurry up! Hurry up! Help! Here comes water! Hang on! Dad, stand up please! Please stand up, yes? lz was really terrible, wasn't it? But you have to go to work today. It's about time you go. Since the day before yesterday they've been calling all the time. Look, the whole has become that deep already and we killed all the white ants. So, you're gonna get dressed now, take your breakfast and get going! If you're going to get fire now we're all going to starve! That's why I'm begging you, go now! Yes? What happened? Such a hard-working man like you are, stays away for three days without telling us. What's that? What was going on? How should I apologize? A case of illness in the family. Yes. But then you could have told us. Well, next time you'll remember. Yes! A beautiful good morning! White ants! White ants! White ants! Dad, what's going on again? What's with your job? Why are you back home already? Kazukuni? What's up with you? White ants! They are certainly still there! Oh, the white ants are all killed! Actually, what are you doing there? Dad, come quickly up! Come up, or you'll drown like a rat! You idiot! You're a big idiot! A moron! Really! Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! I don't want anymore! I can't take this anymore! I can't take this anymore! It's enough now! Now I'm leaving! Thanks a lot for living together until now. Mom! Don't leave! Don't leave! Please stay! Please stay! Just some more patience. Soon the kobayashi family... Kobayashi? What is that? I don't belong here anymore. I don't have anything left here. Who are you? What do you want? Could you please let go of my arm! Help! What do you want? Do you want to rape me? Hey! Hey, you too! Look here! Here! A farewell letter from Erika! A what? - Read it. I am going to sacrifice myself all alone. You please try to find a happy family again. That's it. Erika. Quick, quick, go to her! Hurry up! Search her! Erika! I got her! I got her! She's here! Erika! - Erika! You shouldn't do such fooleries! Let me! Let me! Listen, what grandpa has to tell you! I know, I was bad to you too! I made mistakes, using your make-up and I neglected you too. That was my mistake! I don't want anymore! I can't take this anymore. You animals! You here me? You animals! Finally shut up! If you become even louder, I don't know anymore... Masaki! Masaki! Masaki died! - Masaki! - Masaki! Masaki! Come back! Masaki! Masaki! Come on back, my boy! Hello! Is this the emergency physician? Here is Concrete street 4, Kobayashi. Please instantly send an ambulance. My brother has gone crazy and then he fainted. Please come as fast as possible, I beg you! Did you understand! Kobayashi, Kazukuni. Saeko. Masaki. Erika. Hisakuni. Kazukuni! What are you doing this late? What games are you playing in the middle of the night? Again! No! What's that supposed to? That fits well. I have to tell you something. Please all come to the dining room! What do you want to tell us? I'm tired. Don't you have enough, man? Don't start any new bunk! Really. Come to back your senses. If you became sensible I will forgive you. You exaggerating everything so much. Why are you sitting so tense? What I am going to tell you now is of ultra large importance for us. Therefore concentrate and keep a level head. Now I will switch on the tape recorder and give the microphone to each of you. And then each of you will talk about the Kobayashi family and oneself. Before you start talking better all drink some coffee. There's caffeine in the coffee. For Erika a bit more. The head will be more leveled through this. What nonsense are you talking there? Maybe you still got something left? A little head injury? Bah, nonsense. It's pretty funny. I don't know what he wants but I was just thirsty anyways. Keep attention. Is the volume ok? Good. Ladies and gentlemen, our Kobayashi family is invincible. So, how was that? Erika, now you! Mhm. Puh! That's all? This spring Erika deputes with this song. The lyrics are from Matsumoto Takashi. Composition Otake Eichi. It's going to be a big hit. Can I have your attention please. What's wrong grandpa? Hey? Grandpa? What's wrong with you? The coffee! The coffee! Strange. Dad, is it possible that the coffee is bad? You put something into the coffee, didn't you? What? That's wrong. You said, so we get a leveled head, but my head feels muzzy now. I had such a weird feeling all the time. What are you planning, dear? You locked us all up in here and now u want to murder us. Good. I'm afraid it's about time, that I am forced to, honestly tell you something concerning you. If possible, I will end this without ruffle or excitement. But I'm sadly afraid, it won't work. You force me to be stumpy. You all are terrible sick! Totally mentally impaired! But you don't notice that. And this symptom has developed that far, that there no-one can help you. I noticed the sickness you have already several years ago and nursed you my way. This house for example. Health control. and building the basement. But now I don't know how it should go on. Thereby I have become so tired. I did everything for your sake, really everything. Really everything. Your in the final stadium now. I beg you, die at last! Then you really put something into the coffee? But that can't be. So you poisoned... Yes. That's right. The ant poison is in the coffee. Now I want to die with you too. So take the mugs, please close your eyes and drink everything at once! When you have drunken this you'll finally be freed. This is my last therapy for you. After I stood by you I will follow you instantaneous. Common, drink! Maniac! This maniac! The only one who is sick here is you! Kazukuni! You're heavily sick, believe me, heavily sick. That can't be. So you too. I thought you were the only one of them who wasn't sick. Don't talk rubbish like that and don't blame others. You alone are sick. Your head is sick! You maniac! That's can't be. I had a weird feeling for some time. But you really are sick, aren't you? Totally right. He really is heavily sick, our father. I always wanted to tell you. Yes, you are hopelessly sick. And you, brother, you too you two are similar, you two fit perfectly together! What do I hear? The geezer is really crazy, that's clear! But I'm totally sane! You goat! If somebody of us 2 is sick it's you, you hypertensive nymphomaniac! Shut up! What are you thinking saying something like that, you... you...! Shut your trap! Now both have an attack. I didn't think it was already developed this far. Whereof is this? Your family? Yes, that must be it. It's not a good inheritance. It must be in your family's blood! That's why I am the only healthy one! You are all crazy! Saeko! What are you thinking suddenly saying something like that. No, that's not truer! Erika isn't crazy at all! No, no. Saeko, I'm sorry, but you are all sick. Who are you calling? - I'm calling an emergency physician. Stop it! Stop it! Don't you get it yet? Don't you get anything? What are you doing there? You... What? Watch it, you maniac! You belong into a lunatic asylum! You bugger dare to offend your father? So! I will show you! That's the end! Yes, that's the end! Die! I beg you all: Die! Die! Die! This is a madhouse! Why did I have to get into such a madhouse? Get along with yourself alone! Die! You maniac! Get fucking lost! You want to kill me? But that won't work! Mom! Attention! Bah, you too just get finally lost! Who are you? Not my daughter anymore, that's for sure! Mom, stop that! Mom, please stop that! You scare me! You just shut up! Save me for all the evil spirits! Save me for all the evil spirits! Save me for all the evil spirits! Save me for all the evil spirits! Master! I beg you, help me! I beg you, otherwise I'll be killed! I beg you master, give me strength! Protect me! Now it can start. No. Finally she shows her true face, the evil snake! Fuck! Fuck! Am I angry now! Come here! Right here! I'm ready to fight, you monster! Masaki, I'll redeem you shortly! I will you too, dad! I'll crush your brain. And then I'll have destroyed your dementia. Come on! Huh? Come! Die! No! No, stop that! No! - Look there! It's the blood! Now you see that it is your blood! That's the evidence, your family blood is sick! This girl is now my captive. From this moment on is the whole district controlled by our company. You all have to capitulate unconditionally. Put down your weapons and surrender! If you don't follow this instantly, this captive will be raped right now as punishment! Yes, yes, just do it! Your three generations can commit incest with each others! Very well then! But if want to pull me into this, I'll strike you all dead! That hag! Look! You best look really close! Yes. Yes. Stop. You don't dare do that! I'll never let you do that! Weapons down! This is an order! This chinese girl is very well grown for her 13 years. What are you looking so stupid? Weapons down, I told you. We die all together anyways. Yes, Kazukuni. I understand your hopeless situation very very well. Maybe it is true that our blood isn't pure And that's why we are crazy. And therefore you didn't have enough strength, to defend your surrounding from the enemy. The strong eat the weak. It has always been like that. Ready! And now I'm going over to single combat. As a soldier in Manchuria I killed a lot of guerrillas too! Now I show you what I got! Enough! Finally quit the whining! Aaand company marsh! One two! One! Company attention and to the right! Marsh! One, one, one! And company stop! At ease! Marsh double quick! Go, go, go! Company stop! You, who have been hiding, unnecessary resistance is useless, this district was conquered and has capitulated. The war is over! The war is over! Here I am, you moron! That animal! You beast! You animal! Animal! Animal! Animal! What are you doing? You show a lot of resistance against the troop of the winner! That horny bugger. I willingly make your biggest wish come true! Digging the whole was pretty exhausting, but the fight is even a lot worse, a lot worse. What is it? - Just come, you beast! Common! Come down! It's finally your turn too. I even overlooked that. Leave me! Go away! Get lost! Stand up, you freak! You faggot! The little whore didn't deserve it any better. You filthy... I'll show you, damn old geezer! I'll crush you like a fly! Here comes some more! Fire! It's burning! What? Where burns it? Fire! Fire! Extinguish! Extinguish the fire! Phase 1! Get help! Phase 1! Alarm! Help! Help! Stay back! I advise you. Stay back, with this you'll never make it. It's over. Run for cover! Run for cover! Run for cover! Run for cover! Run for cover! Oh, oh, I'm alive. He's alive! Time for some food. - Huh? It's about time we get something to eat! - Huh? Call the others all! Here, Dad! For you! After the meal we clean up all together, don't we? I have to go on learning. I wasted so much time. Next week Erika has a valuation. Have to practise. Well, that was work enough for today. I thank you all here. I got bruises all over my body and terrible pains. That's why I'll have a comfy bath and then go right to bed. That's not OK. You always only think of yourself and nothing else. That's the reason this whole thing happened. Good. That was the best solution! I beg you, stop it! Hey, Dad! What are you up to now again? You maniac, crazy geezer! Finally stop it! Kazukuni. You still didn't come to your senses. Get done with it! What's going to be with our house? Dad, stop it! - Stop it, I said! You rather be careful not hurting yourself. Go away from there! No! That's not OK! Just think of Erika! Think of Erika! Dad! How laborious was it getting this house! It's not that bad that a bit of it is broken. But if it is completely destroyed, whereto should we go then? Moron! You can't be saved anymore! Don't worry. Dad isn't crazy at all. My doing is the result of thoroughly thinking. I destroy the house, to start a new life with you. We need to be ingenuous and clean to start anew. No comment! Watch me! No, don't do that! The whole house is breaking apart! Stop it!
