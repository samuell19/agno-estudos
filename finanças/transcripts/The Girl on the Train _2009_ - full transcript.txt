THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN Jeanne? Take a look. "Law firm seeks dynamic, bilingual secretary for long-term contract. "Good spoken, written language skills... "experience vital, 5 years + diploma. "Send application. "with CV and photo to Judith Bleistein." Bleistein. The name sounds familiar. Why are you showing me that? Mum, I stand no chance. With a defeatist attitude like that. I'll try, if you insist, but it's pretty far-fetched. Work on your application letter. What do you mean? It's just that... I'm direct. It's not a novel. No. Just this once, let me write it. CIRCUMSTANCES You okay? Why the beard? - For a change. Here, for you. - Thanks. Hi, how are you? Have a good trip? Great. You okay? Life without me, are you coping? It's like a breath of fresh air. I can see. You, old fella, you look years younger. My secret recipe. I let Judith do all the work. That's why she looks so rough despite her tough talk. I'd better go, the family doesn't need me. No, Mum, don't go. She's not going anywhere. I booked a table at Sardegna. Suit you? I'd forgotten what a pain my ex-wife is. Are you okay? Are you hurt? No, I was scared I'd damaged the camera. You know, jet-lag can mess you up. Be nice to your father, okay? Yeah, it works. You've got yourself a nice place. A bit small perhaps. It's a 19th century town house that I completely renovated. You've started collecting? Not only. I try to enjoy life. It's strange. I never thought I could be happy, but as you can see... Yes. I can see. I certainly can. What do you think? Go on, be honest. I don't know, it's brand new. And it's not finished. Mum finds it cold and ugly. She says it's sad. It's your grandfather's dream home. He likes it. I'm not sleeping here. It stinks of paint. I'm going home. - And what do I do? - It's up to you. Nathan, your father's come from China for your holidays. You never see each other. Don't be like that. So, you want to take me to Venice? Yes, I'd like that a lot. I'll pay for the trip. I'll pay if you don't mind. It's my present. I'm sick of presents. Don't touch that. I wanna go home. You're staying with me. Can I help you? - Just looking. - Please do. How much for the case? 50. 30? No, no way. It's 50. The price is 50. You like that one? It's too expensive, 50 euros. Hold on... - 50 euros for this? - Yeah. - It's not even a replica. - It's 50 euros. Look, it's not even worth 15. The price is 50 euros. And the set of 3? These 3, how much? - Those 3? - Yeah, all 3. All three will cost you 90. How about that? - Divided by 3, that makes 30. - Right. Here... - Thanks. - There's 30. Hold on. You're 60 short. You owe me another 60. I'm not taking the others. One case is 50 euros. - So 100 for two? - Yes. - Plus 30 I gave you, that's 130. - Right. - And you said 90? - Right. So you're still ahead. I can count. Come on. Thanks. Hold on... Thanks. I'm Franck and you are? Jeanne. How did you do that with the case? You conned him. Conned him? Don't exaggerate! It's ballsy. You got my courage up. Now you can go travelling. Yes, to Italy. I go every summer for the vacation. And what are we doing later? You, I don't know, but I'm busy. - Tonight? - Neither. So when then? Thanks for getting me a good deal, but no thanks to the rest. Cheer up, there are heaps of prettier girls. I'll be the judge of that. I don't like guys hitting on me. I never hit on girls. This is something else. Love at first sight? And why not? I'll need proof. I'll prove it to you. Here... What I owe you. No, keep it. Give me your number instead. Or your email, or both. I went to interviews all over Paris. Subway, trains, I'm drained. The cops searched people at the station. - You had your I.D. On you? - Sure. - You bought a case? - 30 euros. For the vacation. This year, you can forget your vacation. The bank called. You're 130 euros in the red. Don't worry, I'll find a job. How's your leg? When I put shoes on, it hurts. Isn't she a sweetie-pie? She puts her food away. Give me her strawberry compote. No, don't eat her dessert. I like the chocolate ones better. Her father's here. She misses her Mummy. I'd best get her home. - Yes, she's tired. - Thank you. Go and play. One normal weekday evening, David Rothman was going home from work. As he stepped off the train, he felt a blow to the head. 4 or 5 youths started hitting and punching me, totally unprovoked, for no reason. I asked them why. They said,"We don't like Jews. "You're a dirty Jew. Go back homel" In shock, David escaped with bruises and 4 days' work disability. Of the 541 anti-Semitic acts reported in 2006, physical attacks have increased the most. Over 45% of this year's total. The youngest are most at risk. At school, it would never have occurred to me that one day I'd be punched for being a Jew, even though the Middle East was no easier then. Better protection means religious schools are attacked less. But the Jewish community feels vulnerable since Ilan Halimi was abducted and beaten to death last year. Let me make one important historical point... That's Bleistein, the lawyer. Look! What lawyer? You know, the job offer on Internet. He's changed a lot. How come you know him? Back then, he wasn't bald. ...and didn't wear glasses. He was barely 25. How old was I? You weren't born. He was in the army. Your father was a captain. ...Exposes a long European tradition of anti-Semitism. At the time, he had a crush on me. What about you? I loved your father. ...it's fertile ground for new forms of anti-Semitism. Miss Fabre. Well... It's very vague. Too vague. No references from previous employers. I did have some. Where are they? I sent them off with a CV and forgot to make any copies. Or keep the originals. Your overseas trips. No dates? I'll email them to you when I get home. You speak English? I get by. I can answer the phone, for example. We have a receptionist. Your exact skills escape me. I can do anything that needs doing. Excuse me. Yes? What is it, Mom? I can't talk now, I'm busy. What? Thanks. Don't start all that again. Yes, definitely. Of course, he'll have a Bar Mitzvah. I'll call you tonight, okay? 8 PM. That's 9 PM your time. Okay, Mom. Big kiss. Is that your son on the photo? Yes, why? He looks like you. Going back to your CV... The spelling's awful. They're just typos. Anyway, I prefer talking with people... ...like we're doing now. One-on-one. Does politics interest you? Not particularly. Really? I thought it did. You mention anti-Semitism in your letter. There, the spelling's fine. The style's different. Can I see Mr. Bleistein? Unfortunately, no. He's in a meeting. I'm Capt. Fabre's daughter. My parents were friends of his. You should have said so earlier. I messed up my interview, didn't I? I love making myself useful. If you hire me... I'll do long hours, work hard... I really need this job. It's a pleasure to meet you. I remember your parents from the army. How is your father? He was killed on a mission. I didn't know. I'm sorry. It was in Paris Match. How did it happen? In Afghanistan... ...in the corridor for humanitarian aid. I was 5. I have no memory of it. - Of course. - Only photos. My father was immune to fear. He defied danger. You have an appointment. That's true. Judith will take care of you. My best wishes to your mother. Shall I show you out? Don't worry... we'll be in touch very soon. Goodbye. Do you want to see her CV? How do you work with all that noise? It doesn't bother me... ...but if you want to talk... remember me? - remember me? - Sure. sunday's too far away don't be impatient i wanna see you again where? When? Same as last time ok for everything? What's everything? You are You said it's your birthday soon. I've no idea what to get you. Business cards. - Business cards? - Yeah, embossed ones. Fine, if you have something to put. What would you put? Your profession? My profession, no. Nothing, just me. My name. What do you do? I mean, your job? Secretary. Where? A law firm. Bleistein's. It's opposite Parc Monceau. When we meet, couldn't we sleep at yours? I don't want to force a guy on my mother. I'd like to meet her. What for? No reason. Do you get on well? More than well. We're inseparable. Right. You think that's weird? A bit. Let's go. I liked it there. There, I want to kiss you too much. Come on in. Sorry... I wanted to see Franck's place. I'd no idea... It's 2 to a room here. Jeanne...Tom... Hi, make yourself at home. We share everything. Even chicks. Strip. Strip! You idiots. She fell for it! - The look on her face. - I'm off. - Later, Tom. - You had me going. Is Tom a student? A wrestler, like me. Potential champ. I like the photos. They're of bouts I won. When do you go to Italy? I'm not going. How come? I lent a friend some money and she can't pay me back. So I'm stuck in Paris all summer. You're short of cash? Yeah. Yeah a bit or a lot? Just yeah. - So this is her? - Marius...Jeanne. You were right, she's a looker. Thanks for the compliment. C'mon, I'll show you round. We'll go in the back. Come on. There's a code, 21 BA3. That's the office. Up there's the private living area. What's the job entail? You're the caretakers. During the inventory and summer closing. Any other questions? Come on, kid. I'll leave you the Audi. The shutter's here. See? Buy some decent clothes. Do some shopping and get settled in. I need a regular couple... who won't arouse suspicion. If you say that's us...You're the boss. Okay, you're good. - Here. - Thanks. Look, we got an advance. - Franck! - Coming. Go take a look upstairs. I'll be right back. Right, it's simple. The clean stuff... ...and the loaded stuff. The whole pile? Yeah. Memorise it. Don't write anything down. Right, I'm off. I hope he makes you happy. Franck isn't just anyone. He could win the Olympics one day. And it'll be nice to make money. Pretty dress. The colours suit you. Why do you change the subject? Don't you like my new job? Being a caretaker, honestly... You're a qualified secretary. It's all there was. I'll call Bleistein, talk him round... As if he cares. He's forgotten. He couldn't give a damn. Leave it to me. It's worth a try. Watch the kids... I'll show you something I found. I never throw anything away. It's a letter Bleistein wrote me. "Dear Louise, "I'm leaving the army tomorrow. "I respect your husband... "but you're not cut out for this. "I'm no Prince Charming, but I can give you a new life. "100 years ago, I'd have carried you off. Not now." And he asked me to meet him. Did you? No. Who did you say? Who? Put her through. Yes, speaking. Don't apologise, I'm glad you called. Very glad. Meet up? This week's tough. Hold on, let me check. Next week's better. How about the 25th? 6 PM? I've tickets for a concert. ...at St. Eustache if you like. If you're free. My son's backed out. Yes, I have a son. The noise? There's a train going by. It makes a hell of a racket. Yes, I'm in the suburbs, I'll tell you then. Thursday 25th, okay. Goodbye, Samuel. Gentlemen... Shake hands. Judges? Timekeeper? It's pretty violent. Our motto is "Getting to grips with life". - I can believe it. - Totally. - Can you bring another? - Isn't that enough? - Dessert, then? - Not for me, thanks. Our family doesn't have a sweet tooth. Don't go. I'll have an Armagnac, a cigar. ...and 3 coffees with some chocolates. We don't have any chocolates, but we do have baklava. Sounds good. Am I the joke? Of course not. We're just enjoying ourselves. Franck loves playing the fool. But I'm nobody's fool. Just kidding. No sweet tooth, you said. Liar! It's just a little white lie. Once a liar, always a liar. Are you ever serious? You want serious? Jeanne and me are getting married. You could have asked me first. I wanted your mother there. I think we're all a bit drunk... You know... A wrestling champ is a pretty good catch. Your whole life won't be in the ring, though. The ring's for boxing. Okay, the mat. Physical education teacher, after that. You think that's crap? Look, Franck, it's not about me, is it? It depends on Jeanne. It's her life. Exactly what I hoped you'd say. See, Jeanne? It's your call. Thank you. Excuse me. Just a moment. He insists on paying for us. He's... ...a straight-talker. Yes, I like that. Bordering on aggressive. He knows what he wants. You could say that, yes. - Thirsty? - No, thanks, I'm fine. It's the 1st time I've lived with someone. Me, too. In Lyon, you lived with your family? I have no family. Parents, at least. My brother raised me. I went from his pals to my pals at the Academy. No girls along the way? Girls? Sure, but only for sex. Your brother's still in Lyon? He got into trouble. He's got 2 more months to serve. Is he often... What? In prison. I don't want to talk about it. Can't we find better things to do? What are you doing? Nothing, just looking. I thought you'd split on me. You must be joking. Bored with me? You're crazy to even think it. You drive me crazy. - You okay? - Hi, rascal. Go dry your hair. I went through it all. The passages are underlined. I can't read that on TV, it'll bore people. I think it's vital, but it's up to you. Try to avoid the whole Holocaust trauma. ...that makes us immune to others' suffering. That's the trap. Go freshen up, I need to talk to your grandfather. Not that, nobody'll accept it. It's your call. I can say that, though. So did you talk with Alex? The timing's bad, he'll get upset. The Bar Mitzvah's your idea. Take responsibility. I always take my responsibility. What a family! It's unbelievable. It's your family. No, don't say that. It was my family. Fortunately, that's no longer true. I'm looking for Marius. He's not here. He'll be back in a week. Who are you? I'm the caretaker. Marius didn't say to expect me? No, he didn't. Sorry. Bullshit! I'm here to pick up. Can just see Marius here. Don't you wanna count? - You're new to this, huh? - I'm lost. I'll explain, then. My deal with Marius is 60 eurosIgram. 10 g, 600 euros. You can check. I can't let you do that. Come back when he's here. Sure, in a week. Funny guy! I'm meeting a guy at 7:30. In 40 minutes. Tell me, what do I do? - Whatever you want. - No, I don't. I work for a guy. I'm due at Roissy Village. Know it? Sure, near the airport. Exactly. But the junkie's... Your junkie's none of my business. So back to your car and let me do my job. Okay, hotshot! You weren't surprised by the cash sums Marius paid you? 1,200 euros is a lot for you? 1,200 euros to sit tight in his store? And being paid cash in hand? Marius isn't the type to give pay slips. You and your boyfriend never wondered about the merchandise? Sure, I did. But I trusted Franck. Did you two ever go on a trip to Holland? No. Why do you ask? The drugs found in the store come from Rotterdam. Guedri supplied every borough in eastern Paris. Learn to open your eyes. Follow me, please. Tell me if you recognize any faces. Round here. I don't know any of those guys. Try harder, will you? Are you trying? I got no sleep, I get shuttled about... Tone it down! I want you to listen to something. When I called, no one answered. I was here all day. Why do you let the phone ring? I told you I need a quiet couple. Does your girlfriend know? No, I don't want her mixed up in this. Apparently, you know more than me. That's what saved you from being in a cell. What have we got here? That could be our big boat. No, that one! That's our boat? Okay, it's a big boat. The wind's blowing, the sea's raging. Let's make another, even bigger wave. Have a seat. I've seen you on TV. I get asked often. They like the idea of hard-working poor kid. ...becomes famous lawyer. ...thanks to the French system. Sorry, I didn't get time for lunch. Excuse me. Can I get you something? Tea, please. So, how are you doing? How am I doing? Do we ever know? You never answered my letter. It was insane of me. It was all very childish. I waited for you at St. Eustache. At the last minute, I lost my nerve. Samuel, I'm sorry to bother you... ...it's not my style... ...but I have no choice. You remember my daughter? You met her here. She lives with a... ...guy arrested as part of a drugs ring. He's in hospital. That's why, I thought of you... I thought maybe you'd... I mean, lawyers... Besides you, I don't know any. You know, Louise... ...it's not really my field. Perhaps you'd make an exception. ...for old times' sake. Shit, I'm no good at this... I can't bribe you with the past. This delinquent you mentioned, who's his lawyer? He hasn't got one. Just the public defender. He can't afford one, he's in the shit. I'm ashamed to ask. He needs help. Help, but not false hopes. And your daughter? She's back living with me. I'll need the boy's name and the public defender's. Did you always smoke? I never noticed. A friend smokes like a chimney. He intoxicated me. Friend or lover? Both. I hope I'm not being indiscreet. Not at all, I have no scruples talking about it. You never wanted to remarry? No. With no commitments, I feel stronger. Freer, you see? "Making it official" sounds so awful. My boyfriend wanted to leave his wife. I said no, too much trouble. I preferred to keep it hidden, just him and me. That's still the way I like it. I'd like to see Franck Gu?rin. Your I.D. Card, please? Leave your bag here. I'll look after it. Arms up, please. You can go in. If you've nothing to say, don't come. You knew about the drugs? Of course, I knew. I took the risk for you. For me? So I could live with you. My fault for getting attached. - I care for you, too. - Cut it out. Lying's second nature to you. Why do you say that? You don't work in a law firm. Parc Monceau, your airs and graces... It's a crap lie. What did you want? To impress me? You're an airhead. I'm gonna get 10 years. I wish I'd never met you. Get out. There's no point you staying. Get out! Miss! Your bag. I was at the hospital. Is he any better? Yes. Everything he did was so I'd be happy. I saw Bleistein. He'll find him a lawyer. No, nobody interferes. I know what I have to do. So do I. Don't interfere in my life anymore. The extermination of the Jews will be done, it's a minor detail. Then people come along, 80 million fine Germans, each with their good Jew, saying,"All Jews are pigs, but mine's a fine Jew." But we know what it's like to see 100 corpses lying in a row. 500 lying there, 1000 lying there... And... having withstood that and maintained our decency has made us strong. It's a glorious page in our history that must remain secret forever. My name's Jeanne Fabre. I was born on February 18th, 1987... ...in Germany, at Baden-Baden. I caught a train. ...this morning at 6:30 AM. I got on at Gentilly and stayed standing by the door. As we were coming into Drancy... ...some youths aged 16-17 came down from the upper level. What's that on your cheek? Were you in a fight? Are you sure you're okay? Can I help? Leave me alone. There's a pharmacy nearby. Leave me alone, will you? Whatever you say. Some of them were black... ...others Caucasian. I wasn't paying attention until they jostled me. They stole my bag. ...and found a business card from a lawyer I know, Samuel Bleistein. They said... "She has a Jewish lawyer. Jews defend Jews!" One grabbed my arm. ...and took out a knife. His hand was black. He pushed me right back. I just saw the colour of his skin. The one with the knife, yes, he cut my arms, neck and face. Another raised my dress... ...got out a marker pen and drew swastikas on my stomach. I yelled for them to leave me alone. Nobody got up to defend me. CONSEQUENCES Alex Bleistein, please. I didn't expect you so early. I hate places like this. I love them. I'm delighted to be in a hotel. I realised I'm cut out for it. It's kind of my destiny. Alex, you're not in Paris for long. Your father asks you to stay. Don't be paranoid, accept. Be simple for once. But I am simple. I like being alone and free. My father can't stand my way of life. Or thinking. That's the way it is. Always has been. I hope my relationship with Nathan will be more serene. Serene? Yes, serene. Absolutely. Sadly, it's impossible because of you. You're cold and dangerous. It's not about keeping you warm, but keeping my distance. And keeping Nathan out of it all. So what do you do? You try to turn him against me. He won't go to Venice with you. He hates the idea. You hate the idea, you mean. Don't make him pay for my so-called flaws. Nathan'd rather stay with his friends. He doesn't have any. He's a loner. I was the same. Before I became the jerk who fights with his ex-wife. ...because I want to take my son to Venice. ...so he'll appreciate beauty. So he'll appreciate beauty? You sound like a book. You're like your father. You both have hubris. Hubris? What's the heck is that? The arrogant illusion of being overpowering. Like the heroes of antiquity. So there! Hubris... And I sound like a book! It's always my fault. And you're as pure as driven snow... whatever you do. What do you mean? You know full well what I mean. You're not talking about my lovers again, surely? I still can't get over it. All those texts you sent checking where I was, with whom... Thanks, you've spoiled my appetite. Time for my pool game. I hear you made a film about life in Beijing. - Wanna see it? - Yes. Come up to my room, then. Your room? No way! I've got my life, you've got yours. I won't jump you. Not dressed like that. Honestly, your new look doesn't suit you. Makes you look old. Really? Good. So I won't have to fight you off. Best news I've had all year. Okay, you win. I won't go to the country. No Bar Mitzvah for me. I'm going back to bed. You must come to the country. You can't miss your son's Bar Mitzvah. Look, Judith, it's simple. I'll do what you want. When I was in China, I couldn't get you out of my head. I hated you so bad. Same here. Who can that be? Who can it be? I'll be right back. Good afternoon. Police. - Does Jeanne Fabre live here? - Yes, I'm her mother. Can we see her? She didn't come home yesterday and her mobile isn't answering. We tried, too. Can you ask her to call us? Here's my card. Is something wrong? She filed a complaint yesterday. 6 guys attacked her. Don't worry. They roughed her up, but she only has scratches. Can we see your I.D., please? Don't you have the kids? No, I'm not working, I was waiting for you. Where were you? What happened? I slept at a hotel. I had some spare cash from my caretaker's job. I needed space. The police came by. You need a doctor. No need. After my statement, the doctor examined me. It's superficial. What do you mean, superficial? So they said at the hospital. Look. Mum, it's all over now. The doc said I should forget. Forget? ...Anti-Semitic attack on a train. A woman was set upon by 6 men with knives, who took her to be Jewish. After molesting her, they daubed swastikas on her stomach. Aur?lia Guillemin reports... It was rush hour on RER Line D. At Louvre station, 6 men with knives approached a young woman, shredded her clothes, cropped her hair and drew 3 swastikas on her stomach. It's cowardly not only to do things like this, but also to sit and watch it happen. The victim, who is not Jewish, made a statement to police, but couldn't identify her attackers. They fled from the train at Sarcelles and have yet to be traced. It was on the TV news. It's serious. On TV? Shit. I didn't think... Why did they think you were Jewish? The name Bleistein. They found his card in my bag. That started it. Samuel, she said your name. I'm sure she's making it up. Does she often lie about stuff? But this isn't a minor matter. Louise, as a lawyer... I have a duty of conscience. You should inform the police. The police? No way! She's my daughter, my only daughter. Calm down. Don't answer the phone. There'll be a media feeding frenzy. Come to the country. Get away from it all. Bring her and we'll talk. I'll get to the bottom of this. I stand more chance than you. Mothers are blind, they worry too much. It's the last thing they did before they got off. They cut a lock of my hair as a keepsake, they said. Why did you keep it from me? Because. They said," Keep quiet, we know where you live." You really want the papers? I prefer not to know. Intruding on your family like this... I'm so embarrassed. Don't be silly. Give me your bag. I heard the radio news. It's a real uproar. The Human Rights League... ...the Board of Jews... They've all released statements. There are petitions. ...and journalists are going wild. It's one hell of a stink. What do you think of that? They'll find who did it. They have to. It's not the first attack like this. This is my grandson, Nathan. I'm a monster, like him. Aggressive inside, cuddly outside. That's his idea of a joke. I don't like the country. That's easy for you to say. My wife chose the house. ...and took care of everything. Why do you tell lies? The train attack, you made it all up. We even have a pool. No need to go on vacation. Bar Mitzvah comes from Aramaic. It means"son of the commandment". Thirteen is a decisive age, when you become a man. Responsible for my acts, at last. Thirteen? Seems very young to me. It depends on the father. In theory, he plays a big role. Fathers used to prepare their sons for the ceremony. ...as part of their education. What? What's funny? Nothing. My education, my religion. Makes me laugh. You're not eating? For my Bar Mitzvah, I made a wish. What was your wish? You can tell us now. To be a painter. To earn a living from art. You lacked the talent. Your paintings were mediocre. I didn't want to get your hopes up. They were awful, I admit. I trashed them. ...and changed tack. I got into business school to obey Dad. You didn't have to obey me. You only have yourself to blame. You're right. I don't think I'll go back to Beijing. I don't want to wind up a financial analyst. At Nathan's age, we're all wannabe heroes. But gradually we're nudged aside. It's hard to resist. It's called peer pressure. I don't agree. That's the school of resignation. I don't buy it. I hope Nathan will be able to rebel. Be careful what you wish for. - He's already insolent. - That's not true. Am I insolent, Jeanne? No idea, I don't know you. I'll tell you who I am. I have a modern, liberal education... ...but actually I'm not free. I have to go to Venice to please my father... ...have a Bar Mitzvah to please my mother. My only right is to keep my mouth shut. Tell us what we did wrong. What you did wrong? Your whole relationship, for example. It sucks. Divorced one day, back together the next. You mess up, then act like you know it all. You little shit! Run off to your den! - You wanna come? - She's staying with the adults. You think you're so modern, you're an old-style Jew. Kissing your kids or cursing them. You haven't said much this evening. I was listening. I had nothing to say. I have a contact at the Ministry. The investigation's stalled. No witnesses have come forward. They checked the security camera footage between 6- 7 AM ...and found nothing. The station staff didn't notice anything unusual. That's the time-frame when it happened, huh? Yes, at 6:30. No trace of it. Isn't that a bit strange? Yes, very strange. Let's go fishing. It's the crayfish season. Crayfish aren't kosher. I didn't think you were so religious. You're joking! I'm the agnostic son of communists. Alex is a radical atheist. Judith's the only religious one. I'm going to bed. I'd rather we talk about the attack. That's why we're all here. We'd like to know more. You already know everything. Sorry, I'm tired. I need to sleep. She's traumatized. Her boyfriend got stabbed. He's going to jail. Don't find excuses for her. Anti-Semitic acts have gone up 50%. This isn't one more, it's one less. It discredits real crimes. It encourages revisionism. I'm not defending her. Yes, why so hostile to Louise? Don't blame her, she's trying to make amends. I can understand her lying. It's only human, to gain an advantage. But I don't see what she wins. I'm her mother. She's not here. I'll tell her. Thank you very much. It was the President's office. Jeanne has his full support. This has gone too far now! The President's office! This is crazy! You have no respect. A mother's pain... ...our family name dragged into all this... Our name isn't sacred! Let's have some perspective. The whole thing's grotesque. The President, for God's sake! He should make sure his boys check their information. Same goes for the media. Spare us your leftist spiel. Society's fault, sure! Not society's fault, the State's. And it goes all the way to the top. They chose to alert the media, but they don't have a case. It's not the girl, they're behind all this fuss. Louise, are you in there? Are you okay? I'd better go to bed. The bedroom's which way exactly? This way. I'll show you. Have you any sleeping pills? I never touch them. I think Alex has. It's just his style. Who's this? H?l?ne, my wife. She was beautiful. She was a dancer. Dancer's a fine profession. How could Jeanne do it? I'm so ashamed. No, no shame. That emotion shouldn't exist. What good's a mother's love? If it comes to this. You give, you give... I've nothing more to give. I could kill her! This way! Bring it in here! You're nuts taking the boat out in this. You wanna drown? You can't sit here in a wet dress. Take it off. I won't look. You can turn round, I don't care. Watch out! All this wood, it could catch fire. No sweat. And with all that rain coming down. - You often sleep here? - Yeah. This is my den. It's to celebrate Sukkoth. What's Sukkoth? The Feast of Huts. 40 years of wandering for the Jews in the desert. Here at least, no one's on my back. Come closer to the fire to get warm. Why did you call me a liar in the car? Look at me. You can see the marks. I didn't make it up. Look. Touch. Will you believe me now? I'd like to believe you, honestly. But something doesn't add up. What do you mean, doesn't add up? The guys searched through your bag? Yes, and? They found a card with"Bleistein" on it? That's how it happened. I'm sorry, it's not my fault. My grandfather always says business cards are for idiots. He never got any printed. You had no way of knowing. You have to tell them the truth. How did you make those marks? At home, with a knife. Why did you do it? I don't know. I wanted to be loved, and the opposite happens. You can make noise, I'm not asleep. Why are you up so early? They'll be looking for me. My parents sleep till noon at least. Is your dress dry? It's okay. I'll be going. Good luck! You're going the wrong way. Go round there. I wasn't sure. Can you get the boat? I'd rather walk. If you want. Seen the sky? It'll be a beautiful day. Nice and low to avoid waking your mother. Want some coffee? - Yes, please. - Sit down. Normally, she's up at this time. We got to bed late. And she took a pill. She's shaken up by all this. I made it all up. I lied to everybody. You knew, didn't you? I'm not a cop. My job's not to force you. It had to come from you. Just a moment... Okay, write. "To all those I deceived. "and hurt by my acts... "I wish to say that I'm deeply sorry. "I present my apologies to the President... "to all the police officers and rail staff. "called into action by my acts... "and all the people. "who expressed their support for my lie." Jeanne's come to her senses. - Want some coffee? - No, thanks. Actually, I will. What do I do now? We have to get back. Thank you for everything. Don't thank me, it was nothing. What else should I write? Nothing. Just sign it. The first thing to do is call my colleague. I have complete faith in him as a lawyer. - Thanks for being... - Stop thanking me. I did the minimum, believe me. It felt weird seeing you again. Let's not make a meal of it. What do you mean? No virtual romance. You're happy with your life, aren't you? - Yes. - Me, too. - Except for Jeanne's brainstorm. - Go easy on her. It was only a lie, make-believe. All that fuss with no proof, just a statement and a few scratches. It's outrageous. I'll go with you to the police. No, I prefer to go alone. Are you sure? Yes. - The swastikas were back to front. - That's not all. Louvre to Sarcelles takes 13 minutes. The train stops 3 times. It's impossible. People get on and off. They'd have said. Police HQ confirmed the news that went out on press wires. The Justice Ministry didn't urge caution. A serious error. Any excuse to accuse inner-city youths and expose cowardice. And underline the attackers' minority origins. It reflects people's fears. Play on that, not on her pathology. I'll try. Go on in. Remove all your clothes and hand them to me. Give me your bra, too. I keep it. Lower your panties. Your blanket. You can get dressed. Yesterday, we revealed doubts about the attack on RER Line D. The young plaintiff was placed in custody today. She has confessed to making up the whole story that provoked a wave of outrage. Sander des Adrets reports... Within these walls, Jeanne is in a cell. Questioned by officers, she admitted to making it all up. If found guilty, she risks 6 months in prison and a fine of 7,500 euros for false report of a criminal act. I want my daughter to get treatment and justice to be done. I agree that it's not right for her to upset the nation. I knew she was fragile. She'll see a psychiatrist, but she says she's not ill. She says she's not ill. Where did she get the name, Bleistein? Is it the famous lawyer? A friend of hers? A name she made up? I don't know. Jeanne spent 48 hours in custody. She got a 4-month suspended sentence with 2 years'probation conditional on psychiatric care. I've been taking notes on the case. Maybe I'll write a book about it. I already have a title, "Story of a Lie". Did you realise she told lies? Obviously. It didn't bother you? No. Her lies took her far away... ...like she was escaping me. It made me want to possess her, make her mine. In her way, Jeanne's a rebel. If you like, yes. When we were together, we never fought. I never met such a submissive girl. She always said yes. I'd happily do it all over again. All of it. Shall I read or make it up? - I want you to read it. - Okay. "Once upon a time... "there was a little boy. "who didn't want to go home. "and wanted to live in the forest." Why? "Because he preferred. "being with the animals than his parents. "His favourite animals were the birds." Do you like birds? Yes. Why do you like birds? Because they live in trees. ...and because they fly. You'd like to fly, huh? Job Offers Dear Jeanne, I often think of you and our night in my den. You wouldn't let me touch you. Too young, I guess. I'm growing up and hope one day you'll let me take you in my arms.
