Where's Vince? I don't know. He's still up on the ridge. That ain't ours. That's Chink. Okay, wait five. Thought I was gonna have to drink alone. Yeah, they've got you dealing, haven't them? Yeah, only the two fingers out, deal with the other three. Okay, daddy. Come on, get up. Take it easy, they got me in the leg too. Let's make a piggyback. - Okay. - Hold on, Jameson. Okay, give me a hand, will you? Easy. Easy. Well, I owe you something, huh? Yeah, you're marked deck. You're such an honest slob, you wouldn't use it. Come on, let's get out of here. Easy. Better make sure there's no more of them. Alll right. Check everything. And check behind those locks. Look, you big square. I've never made a promise in my life, but I'm making one to you now. If we ever get out of this thing and I ever make any money, a lot of money, half of it's gonna be yours. It's a promise, Matty. Gotta get this thing out of here! Hey! Move it! Let's go! How long were you in the hospital? Oh, it was a long time. First in Korea, and then here. I felt like Humpty-Dumpty. They got you back together again. More or less. And now it's silver. Oh, vitallium. - Vitallium? -I know, it looks like silver. Doesn't it tarnish? I wouldn't want a polished job every six months. You're lucky to be alive. That's what I keep telling myself. What about Vince? Ever hear from him? Oh, three postcards in eight years. He moves around a lot. I think he's in Central America. Tell me about Nina. I don't mean the gossip. Tell me the other things. Like what? Do you still... Are you still in tantrum with her? The answer is yes. I don't understand. I mean, if you don't love her anymore... Well, it's different when you're married. I wouldn't know. Maybe... Maybe I'm in love with her the way she was. Maybe it's my fault that she's not that way now. Does it ever ache? Sometimes. It feels cold. Well, the rest of me is warm. For Nina, Matt, not for me. - Come here. - I don't have any right. I'm going, Matt. Could I see you tomorrow? No doubt. - Del Garsa. - Thank you. Thank you, Se?or Del Garsa. Would you register, please? Room 431, Mr. Del Garsa. - Good morning. - Good morning. Is he in? Stucco, ballast, verity's rock, who cares? We're in business to make money. I know all about making money, and the first thing you do is to give people what they pay for. They're paying for a house, they're getting a house! Look, let's just forget it. Buy me out. There's a little matter of advances against salary. Deduct them. You wouldn't break even. You know, she's got a expensive taste. I'll tell you what. You wanna get out of the hole, why don't you squeeze the subcontractors a little? There are such things as kickbacks. I'll look the other way. Now I know where Nina got her sense of values. You can't be a hero all your life. You'll learn that. Takes too much out of you. How are you, Mr. Jameson? Good, hi, Ruth. Is Mrs. Jameson here? Upstairs. Mr. Jameson, patience is a virtue of the Lord but there isn't such a thing as too much patience. Oh, yeah, you're sure right about that, Ruth. You're sure right. Nina. Nina. Stick them up. I thought you might join me in a drink for once. Don't you think we've outgrown the water pistol stage? It's not a water pistol, honey. It's a martini pistol. Taste it. I got it especially for the party. Be a big hit, don't you think? Come on, Nina. Grow up, will you? If you want some of this, get a glass of the bathroom. But it's twice as dry this way. Aerates it or something. Well, if water pistols are your idea of... Martini pistols. ...are your idea of not being dull... Your idea seems to be cheap little secretaries. You, uh... You wanna discuss secretaries, do you? They all have fat hips. I said let's discuss them. Sure. How about Monday? You came home with lipstick on your chin. Like a schoolboy. Just like a schoolboy. You know, uh... Lipstick on the chin is almost a mark of innocence. Since when? Well, if there were any big affair, you can be sure the lipstick would all be wiped off. Now let's discuss your innocence. Let's not. By the way, I heard about your new blow-up with daddy today. What have you got? A direct line? Well, of course. I'm still daddy's little girl. Isn't that sweet? You wanna help me? I'm getting a little secretarial myself. Do you think I'm getting a little secretarial, a little, huh? But not too big. You know, you're gonna threaten to quit your job once too often. I know daddy. He'll take just so much and then... poof! Anyway, I should think you'd be grateful. For what? Everything daddy's given you. Especially me. Don't think I like this dress. Gonna get changed, little schoolboy. You'll be late for the party. This old zipper is always so darn stiff. Would you do it for me? You know something? Leave it. I don't wanna go to that party. Matt. Matt? Please, Matt. Matt, please. Never mind, Rose will get it. Sure she will. I just wanted to make sure I still owned you. One of these days I'm gonna kill you. I know it. I feel it. Please. You know I bruise easily. It's all right, honey. Everyhing's under control. You well... run along, huh? Hey, hero! Vince. Hey, the morgue? Hey, hero! Vince. Who were you expecting? You, son of a gun! Hey, you phony! You phony! I thought you'd be a fat old man, buddy. You'd better look greater, I'll tell you. Yeah, well, it's the late hours and all that liquid, huh? Hello. That's just my style. Hey, you remembered, buddy, a blonde. Oh, she's perfect. Sweet, huh? Honey, this is the fabulous Vince. A pleasure. Well, you're a real fine buddy, buddy. My first night down, you got me a long one, huh? How about you? What do you want? Oh, I'm gonna like him. Well, that's my wife, and you know it. That's your...? For real? For real. You're breaking my heart. Bet I'd never do. Hey, honey, you're coming unglued. Here, let me fix it for you. Oh, allow me. Oh, he's got to come to the party. Absolutely. I tell you what, pretty girl, you... you run along, and let Matty and me be together for a while, huh? Why don't you go on, honey? You know, Vince and I haven't seen each other in eight years. But I wanna get to know him. Don't worry. He'll be here when you come back. Promise? Guaranteed. You know, we do have a guest room. Oh, it's fine. Do you think he'll be happy in it? He's used it before. Here we are everybody. Oh, I need one more. Hey, wait a minute, what are you doing? Cut that out. Come on. Oh, come on, Ralphie. Let's really play for that star. Excuse me. Don't waste it. Here, honey, have some of this. - Listen, Annie Oakley. - Thank you, Jane. Why don't you find your own husband? Ah, shut up! We were just having fun. Hey, by the way, where is Matt? Yeah, where is Matt? Ah, that's the question. Where is Matt? Well, where is he? Matt is getting ready. Ready? I've been ready for years. Ready for what? Murder. Wait a minute, everybody. I'm not kidding. He wants to kill me. He already tried once. See this bruise? What's it? Oh, boy, what a way to die! Yeah! I told him it just wasn't done at barbecues. Hey, hey, anybody for Braille? Yeah! Yeah! But I never thought you'd get here. I always keep my promises, don't I? Old promises too? Old promises too. Mr. Jameson, are you sure you won't need me? Oh, yeah. It's all right, Ruth. We're just gonna lie about our war record. You go on and have a good time. God bless you, Mr. Jameson. Thanks. You know I rented the car and I rented this with the slides I own. Now, if you can provide the wall. For sure. Let's see. Yeah. This picture out here. Matty, s? sincero. How are things going, really? Lousy. Well, Uncle Vince is here, and your troubles are over. Come on, sit down. Uh... do you want me to turn out the lights? Yeah, turn them out. Now, this is the guy I work for. Se?or Melendez. You know, he's so rich he could buy the state of Texas out of his petty cash fund. He's tied up very close with this fellow, Peral, the strong-arm boy, the dictator of Cuellavaca. Now, Peral has some enemies. They're sort of the strong-arm agitator types. They lifted 3.5 million from Se?or Melendez. It's pure cash. Dollars, not pesos. Where's the 3.5 million now? It's on its way here in a suitcase. A gray metal suitcase. With this fellow, Se?or Zaragoza. He's due to arrive in San Francisco with the money to buy arms. Uh, Zaragoza can't buy arms here. They made a deal with a Yugoslavian syndicate. The Cuellavaca consulate general's office in San Francisco has made the arrangements. Now, Peral's enemies will get their arms if Zaragoza delivers the money. That's it. No gooks, no bullets, no bugs, and no mud. It's easy, huh? Remember the old days, Matty? We had to take a whole hill to make the boss happy. Now all we have to take is a suitcase. A gray metal suitcase. You drive, I grab, we both run away. Soft touch. That's no joke. I'm serious. Yeah, I know. That's what's so funny. Look, Matt, I got Melendez's word. Recover his lost loot and the commission is one cool million. Half for you. Just for doing the driving? Wrong star pays off, suburban chauffeur gets lucky, huh? You're the good old Vince, Korean Army, as always, aren't you? You know, for five minutes I was goofy enough to think that you really might have something worthwhile. What could be better? A blow for humanity. And a fat fee. All in one. Fat fee is right. Let me ask you a question. What makes this Melendez so incredibly generous? Well, I've done him some favors. You know, personal favors. A million dollars is his way of paying me back. And a half a million is my way of paying you back. Wouldn't it be because you can't pull this job off alone and you need somebody you can trust? Yeah, that could be part of it, yeah. Come on out. Come on! What kind of a spook is that? Come on out. Come on! That's a neighbor's spook. She comes from a party next door. Come on out! - Hey, spook! - Come on! Get out of here! Get lost! Come on, we want you two to play Braille with us. Go on home, Vera. She's too drunk to get the message. I'll give her a message. Well, what do you say, buddy? How about the plan? Let's say you're nuts. I'm heading for San Francisco, but I'll stick around for a couple of days. And, I know you, before I leave I'll give you an address where you can reach me. It could be you change your mind. Well, think about it, buddy. It's growing. I laughed at him at first, but now I'm beginning to think maybe I'm the jerk. He swears it's legitimate and he says all we're gonna be doing is recovering what rightfully belongs to his boss. It's a nice phrase for stealing. Look, stolen jewels are recovered this way all the time. It's accepted procedure. Do you take me for a thief? You're thinking like a thief. All right. All right, never mind, I was just talking anyway. These impossible dreams of yours. What's wrong with them? Just ways of avoiding decisions. I make lots of decisions. And what about us? There's not gonna be any more of us, Liz. As of tonight, we're not gonna see see each other again. Why, Matt? Oh, look, don't you see I'm in hock up to my ears? I can't get out of this marriage. Besides that, I'm bad luck for you. I don't care about the luck. Well, I do, and I'm gonna change it! If you had Vincent's half-million, would it make any difference? You bet it would. I'd get out of that marriage and I'd grab you, honey, and I'd say "let's go". And I'd say no, Matt. No, thanks. I remember my father. He was always looking for $200. "If I could just find $200, I'd get rolling". He said it once, he said it a thousand times. Don't you see, Matt? It's not a question of a half a million or a half a hundred. It's not a question of money at all. What is it, then? If you really wanted to get out of your marriage, you'd get out. No matter what the cost. If you're looking for an easy solution, then you're not gonna find it. Maybe you're right. When I first met you, I thought you were an impossible dream. I even started to back out. And I heard the talk about Nina. Nina and this one, Nina and that one. Shut up, Liz. Well, take a look at me, Matt. I've become just like all the other little girls. Secretaries in love with their bosses, hiding in the shadows waiting for their wife to bow out. What's happened to me? Somewhere along the line, I've lost my sense of values. I don't like myself. I'm not very nice at all. Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are nice. Don't you see? It's me. I'm the heel. I'd still like to change my life. Please don't go to San Francisco. I won't. I won't. Don't worry. Look, why don't you do me a favor and find yourself a nice fellow without any problems and get married? You make it sound so simple. I'm glad we figured a few things out in time. It's barely here. One of these nights, I... I'm being as close as you need it. You're telling me. I guess I'll be getting another job. Liz. Liz, I know this sounds empty, but... Good luck. Good luck, always. I like it loud. You get Vince to the airport? Eventually. What does that mean? Whatever you want it to mean. He's not dull, I'll tell you that much. He's fun. Was it good, lover boy? Was what good? The cat on the hot tin typewriter. You mean Liz? She's always good. But not in the way you mean. She's a very nice person. What's that? It's what you could be. If you wanted to. Sounds dull, awfully dull. I dub you... Sir Matthew. Matthew the brave, Matthew the honorable, Matthew the defender of secretaries. Matthew the patient, Matthew the honest builder, Matthew the noble. Arise and accept your honors, Sir Matthew. Sir Matthew. Matthew the long-suffering. The long-suffering hot tin nothing. Nothing. Nothing! Go ahead, kill me. I told the neighbors you were planning to and they're expecting it. Did I hurt your little head? You just must have forgotten it. Forget? How could I forget? Everybody knows about Matt Jameson. He's a hero. Korean war hero. Buzz, buzz, buzz, yes, that's the one. Matt Jameson has a plate in his head. He stopped a bullet in the war. He's the medal winner. Oh, yes, buzz, buzz, buzz, Matt Jameson, plate in his head. - Matt Jameson, plate in his head. - Shut up! You're not a hero anymore. You're a zero. A zero hero! I came back here tonight to try to patch things up. I wanted us to get back together again. You know what I'd do without you? I'd get a hold of that doctor who fixed your head. Because when he put that plate in, he took something out. The stuffing. The hero stuffing. That's what he took out. And now you're just a long-suffering, lame duck with a built-in excuse. What do you want from me, Nina? What do you want? Nothing. It's too late. Much too late. It's too late for you. You're a spoiled human being. You're drunk, you're sick, and all the rest of it. What about the rest of it? Do you wanna know about the rest of it? All right, I'll tell you. It's the locker room talk. It's the club talk. And what I hear makes me sick. Whatever the boys said, they were probably right. Maybe it's... Maybe it's more than being just a spoiled human being. Maybe it's a disease. Compulsion's a disease. Drinking too much, that's a disease. You got something that's worse. Put a label on it. Go ahead. I don't like the word. Well, I don't know what you can do about it. Because you've done nothing about anything the past seven years. No, and I'll tell you why. It's because I've been in a cell. A lock-padded cell. And I think I was put in that cell deliberately by you and your father. Poor fellow. Little Nina had round heels, and you think her nasty old father locked zero hero in with her to make her respectable. That's it. That's exactly what I think. Pity. Why'd you let it happen? The decline and fall of Sir Matthew. Now he's just an ice-fetcher for Princess Round Heels. Well, I'm through fetching. Suddenly you're gonna change. Suddenly I'm gonna change. Doesn't happen suddenly. I got a cure that's gonna come fast. You just watch me. I wish you luck. Where are you going? I'm gonna pack a bag, Princess. I'm getting out of this cell. No! You can't leave me! You can't leave me, do you hear? I'm leaving you! I'm leaving you! ?Si? Es el Sr. De Garza. It's me, Vince. I'm here in the hotel. Matty? You changed your mind, huh? Hey, you're no longer the builder of houses, huh? No longer the errand boy for Se?or Malden. You are the smart muchacho, huh? Come on up, Matty! Buddy, now we start the rehearsal. Now up that ramp is the new freeway constructed by the citizens of California to make our job a lot easier. 18 minutes from here to the airport. We don't want to hit it too early and not too late. There's not gonna be any gunplay. Guaranteed. The cops are not there. If I ever find you're playing me for a sucker... Buddy, you saved my life. Would I do that to you? I don't know. Would you? Trust me. Just trust me, kid. Get in close. Listen to teacher. See the lower level? That's for arrivals. Incoming passengers, head for it. You know we're in a restricted area. That's right. But don't worry about it. We won't be in this car. Affairs of state are handled in style. We'll have a limousine and a diplomatic sticker. While you're waiting here for me, I'll be in there meeting Zaragoza. You mean the courier? Yeah, the guy with the money. He'll come through that door. How long is it gonna take you, Vince? About five minutes. He's a VIP, gets his baggage in the hood. Meaning the gray metal suitcase. The gray metal suitcase with the green money. Three and a half million dollars. What about customs? There's no problem. He has diplomatic immunity. When I get him in the car, I'll jab him with a hypo. But don't wait for it. Get going immediately. What's in that hypo, Vince? The stuff that dreams are made of. You're not gonna hurt him, are you? Do I look like a nasty man? Didn't you see that sign? Yes, I did. It says no parking. It means no parking. I'm sorry, officer. We're just trying to spot a friend of ours. Yeah, I know. Move on. If that happens on the big day, you just give him the old diplomatic over routine. You know, "no comprende ingl?s". The sticker will make it convincing. That car's been following us ever since we left the airport. Maybe it's a blonde that thinks you're cute. Gives me the creeps. No, it's a guy. He looks normal enough. So do we. Look, we relax. We got 20 more rehearsals to go. Fancy-looking hospital. Yeah, Zaragoza travels first class. I'm taking him through that side door and leave him in confident hands. While I'm inside, you got a little, uh, housework to do. Like what? Scrape off the decal, wipe off all the fingerprints. All the fingerprints. And do a good job. The boys in the yacht club might be watching. Yacht club where? The guide maps call it Alcatraz. After we deposit Zaragoza, then what? Then we hop in the little old station wagon and take a million-dollar ride, buddy. Huh? My chum were golden. My message of a few days ago bore fruit. There'll be no reception committee at the airport for Se?or Zaragoza. You called the consulate again just now? Yeah, just now. As far as they're concerned, Curio Zaragoza won't arrive till next week. Intense week. Yeah. Hand me the hypo. Might as well get everything ready for the good Se?or. All right, Mr. chauffeur, time for your bonnet. Hey, you look pretty good in that. Maybe you missed your calling. Reminds me of the old days, huh, Matt? Just like going on patrol, don't you think? You got that same stomach-in-the-mouth feeling, if that's what you mean. Relax, kid, it'll be a snap. So far, I've seen at least ten suspicious cars. Take it easy, buddy. There aren't that many nice guys like us in the whole town. Good deeds are rare these days. There's another limo in our space. Maybe the council's wise to us. Don't worry. It's a studio car. Must be some big actor arriving. Things are starting to go wrong already. I don't like this, Vince. Hey. Hey. You're making me nervous. We're going out now! Making quite a stir, aren't they? Let me loose! I'm going to hand this autograph to my kids! I'm going to hand this autograph... I love you all! I love you all, yes! Thank you, kindly! Thank you, kindly! I love you all, yes! I love you all, yes! No gunplay, huh? What are you crying about? I'm the one that got hit. - Is it bad? - Bleeding like a bull. Who were those other guys? I recognize one of them. - Has a beard? - No. And the other guy's name is Cortez. - They're some of Corelli's boys. - Yeah, he's one of the agitators. On his own now, probably angling for the big hauls just like... Just like us. Is that it? I'm taking the Bayshore Route. Are you crazy? Go as planned, use the freeway. No, it's an old route. Less chance the cops. Look, Matty. As we rehearsed, the freeway. All right, go ahead and pull the trigger. Be your own chauffeur. Well, you failed me out once, kid. You do it again. Good move. Look, Vince, you better get this straight. This time I'm saving my skin, not yours. Are you making it? No. Can you do anything about it? Yeah, I can drop dead, but I'm not going to. Cars 87 and 94 proceed to Bay Bridge off ramp and... 909 B regarding... The police! ...go too. Hang on! Our hard-hitting Arturo Tamalito. He's the congressman for you, Your next congressman, Arturo Tamalito. He'll lower your taxes. He has never been beaten in San Francisco. Vote for Arturo Tamalito. Watch out! Everybody watch out! The police! Quick, let's make a run for it! So it was just getting money back for your boss, huh? - Later! - You bet, later. You really did get it, didn't you? Get the money first. Well, come on. Easy. That's it. That's it. Okay. Now what do you say? They're all in hundreds. 500 to a stack. It's $50,000, right in my fat little hand. That's 50,000. That's 50 grand, Matty. From now on, it's Christmas for a lifetime. Christmas forever. You know, this stuff cures anything. All you have to do is rub it on a wound and it gets well. Come on, baby get well. Get well. Big toys, Matty. Girl toys, Matty, pretty pink girl toys and pretty pink ribbons. We're thieves. We're nothing but lousy thieves. We're saving lives, Matty. We're preventing a bloody revolution. Go ahead and count it. 50,000 to a stack. 73 stacks total. $3,650,000. That's exactly right. You are lifting this to return to Melendez? You were just stealing it. So-so. Exactly right. That's my way, buddy, of... ...paying you back for saving my life. I don't know that I... I want any of it. Well, while you're thinking it over, go buy me a doctor, will you? I wanna be around to enjoy my Christmas party. And try a rich neighborhood, will you? The girl's here. Why not? We had an argument and I didn't think she'd be around. Hey, check it. - Is it sure with the logs? - Yeah. Anything in the paper? They don't write it. No mention. Good. Let's hope it stays that way. Come on before anybody watches us. Well, careful. There's my bursitis. Hey! Where are you going? I gotta break the news to Nina about our happy houseguest. When you get that test done, get your job back. What for? Appearences, buddy. Appearences. Nina. - You again? - Your note is very dramatic. I started to leave last night. But... I'm taking my time. You have no right to the house anyway. - Obviously you kept the house filled. - Of course. Of course. I've got compulsions, remember? Let's not get into that. I'm gonna be back for a while, if you don't mind. I do mind. Vince is back with me. He can stay. He's got to stay, you see... he's recuperating from an operation. They took a piece of bone out of his leg and they put it into his shoulder. Something about bursitis. Ran into him in San Francisco. What were you doing there? Oh, I was... uh... up there looking for contracting jobs. San Francisco is a good place for you. For better or for worse. Look, Matt, darling, I haven't changed mind. Pardon me. I thought I heard voices. - Good morning, Ruth. - Mr. Jameson. Can I...? Can I fix you some breakfast? Oh, no, no thanks, but... our house guest, Mr. Biscay, is back. You may ask him if he wants some scrambled eggs or something. Certainly. Very nice to see you back, Mr. Jameson. Thank you, Ruth. Ruth, take my bags back upstairs. We're all gonna play house again. Trick or treat? Happy Halloween! But what is this? Hi! It's Halloween! I thought Halloween was tomorrow. Oh, well, it's good enough, isn't it? He's not a man, he's a calendar. Well, girls, here he is. Lover, this is Vera. She's our local Braille expert. How do you feel, doll? And this is Yolande. She's an expert at everything. And this is Arlene Andrews, our local gossip columnist. Mr. Biscay, is it? Look gossip, the PTA meeting is that way. Besides, I'm in considerable pain. Where does it hurt, honey? All over. What you don't seem to realize, girls, is that it's a very contagious disease. What is it? Yeah, what is it? It eats you away slowly. Where does it do that? Shall we see? Like here for instance. Ohh, it's for real! How awful! Come on, Mr.Biscay! Hey, hey, this is a sick man. What's the matter with you? He's not to be bothered. Now come on, get out of here, all of you. Out! You know, you know better than that now. Don't stir. Bye! Bye! Shut the door. You're about 5 minutes too late. Slipped away from the party I saw old man Malden. I got my job back. Those Halloween witches blab! You'll have a job with the government for life. Liz. This is for you, it's important. Hey, wait, wait a minute. Don't run away. I have to get back. I have a new job. Sneak! Sneak! - Sneak! - Get out of here! Believe me, I'll use it. - You may have to. - One point. She came to my room. - You're still leaving right now. - Where? Anywhere. You and the money. I'd be a little conspicuous, wouldn't I? Listen, buddy, if they get me, I'll make sure they get you. I'm not gonna fry alone. I'm still getting you out. Wouldn't be too hard for them to put that together to figure it out. All right, I'll leave. You pick me a place to hide. I'll stay there until I am well enough to travel. Yeah. Keep those for your souvenirs, huh? Yes, folks have a cabin in the mountains about 50 miles from here. Pack my bags, boy. Don't you push me, Vince. I'm taking Vince to the airport. I'll talk to you when I get back. Drop dead! Maybe I won't be here. Come in, sneak. I know you're sneaking again. What did you do? Park two blocks away? Sneaky snake! You've come to give me a whole mishmash about Vince, no bother. He's not the first. It's the most recent of a long life. A long life. All of them fun, especially Vince. And the first time that happened was the day I drove him to the airport. Bad sore guy. I'm getting the divorce, not you. Understand? I'm getting the divorce. You, spy! I'm leaving. Good! Get out and stay out! I can't stand sneaks anyhow! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! It's been written that people like you will burn in the fire. You're the worst kind of sneak with your pious phrases! You mark my word: The Lord will punish you for tormenting a good man. I bet he pays you extra to spy on me, doesn't he? Doesn't he? Doesn't he? No, in the name of God! You're the devil in the bottle! Oh, my God! Get out! Get out of my house now! Hag! Witch! Sneak! Sneaky snake! Now who's that dumb? Push people downstairs, will you? That's what they teach you in your holy books? You and your friendly friend. You're no saint. You're a killer, a worthless killer! Killer! Killer! And your man starved too. With all your Bible babble your man starved. You're in love with my husband. Don't think I haven't seen that cow look on your face! Well, you can have him. Who wants him? Now hurry up and get out, snake, and take all your junk with you. I don't want any part of you around here! You wanted the place, don't you? You maids, you're all alike. We take you out the streets and give you a place to live. And what are you doing? Nothing but frown and sneak. and look thoroughly. Ungrateful haggs. Hey you, I'm talking to you! Hey, you Saint Sneaky! Hey, you! Nina... Nina... Decided you want some of the money? No. Oh, come on, buddy. - Take 'em, hey. - I'm sad. Look, I wouldn't feel right if you didn't get your share. After all, you extended the courtesies of your house. All the courtesies. That's a bad joke, Vince. Nina is dead. What did you do, kill her? She was dead when I got back from here. I found her in the hallway. She's been drinking. She must have fallen. Heck! Come on, buddy. Huh, come on. That's the truth. You know, I think I almost believe you. What difference does it make? She wasn't worth it. Besides, what does that have to do with me? I buried her. What? I buried her where she'll never be found. Believe me. With these... they'd say I killed her. What am I gonna say? That I wasn't there when it happened? That I was up in the mountains with a guy named Vince Biscay? This Vince Biscay. You're taking Nina's car and driving to Mexico. I'm the bad guy. I ran off with your wive, huh? That's it. Now you tell me, buddy, how am I gonna drive? I really don't care. I just know you're gonna do it. Okay. Pretty soft touch, okay? There aren't any soft touches, Vince. You really believe that, don't you? I sure do. Hey, you could be right. I'll let you know. Now they said the release is the biggest project we've ever taken. Believe me, the biggest one. Nothing like it ever before anywhere around. Hi, son. Where's Nina? She's gone. She's what? She's gone. So it's Vince, our houseguest. I was afraid of this. I could feel it coming. Alright, Mr. Malden. If we could have you and Mr. Jameson come over here. Right over here? Alright here? Over here, Sir. Hey, Matt, come on. Come on over here. Right on this side. Down, just a little bit. Right here. All right. We wanna get the cement in too. - Hold it. - Now a nice big smile for everybody. - Hold it. - A real big juicy smile. Look happy. Come on, the world is yours. Hello. Hello, Liz. Matt... Matt. Yeah, you alright? No, Lizzie... Oh, the whole world has gone wrong. Everything's upside down. You guessed right about those clippings. And you did go with Vince? Yeah, yeah to San Francisco. Oh, Matt, I've warned you. Look, Lizzie. I gotta talk to you. I gotta talk to somebody. Nina is... ...dead. What? Nina is dead. Matt, Matt... you, you did? Oh, no, no. I'll explain it when I see you. You better pick me up here tonight. What time? At 6. I'll see you at six then. Thanks, Liz. Nina... Nina... Nina! Not yell. Any luck? We have looked everywhere. We find nothing. There must be here somewhere. Half of it anyway. Biscay would have the other half. We have looked everywhere. Take the sponge out. Nina... Nina... Not yell. Where is the money? What... what money? The money you took from Zaragoza, you and Biscay! Biscay? Vince Biscay. S?. S?. Vince Biscay. I haven't seen Vince Biscay since the war. He thinks he's 21. - He makes a bluff - Oh, no, no. no! Perhaps not. Perhaps you have erased the memory by the force of the blow. I know about these matters of the head. No, no, wait, wait. My brother, the doctor, he tells me about this when I'm a fighter. He says every blow to the head is a concussion. This my brother, the doctor, tells me. Nina!!! Wait, wait. Hey, look. Look... This is why he does not remember. Part of his head is missing. Perhaps he will get his memory back. Perhaps never This my brother tells me. Any doctor can tell you this. We cannot ask the doctor. I suggest if we leave before it is too late. There's nothing we can do here. Yeah. Come on. That's it, baby! We've come to see you. We're gonna have a party! Here we are, baby. Gunned all! You're sad and lonely! That's a surprise you're right back. Look at this place: you two really had a knock-down drag-out. Take my advice. When she comes crawling back, tell her to get lost. There are plenty more pebbles on the beach. Man, pebbles to die! American? American. Vacation? Just a few days. What's in here? Three and a half million dollars. Go on. Just give up, boy. It'd be from my own land. She wears size 12 and pregnant pants. Morgan, it's yonder doorbell. I can see you're tied up. I'll go. Good. I'll go see who it is. Nobody go away! Wow! Is Mr. Jameson in? Oh! Come on, baby, joint the party. That fella don't wait too long. Oh yeah, look what drops in the first night his wife's gone. Remember our motto: You are into your life. Little added entertainment: Spinning the bottle for a brawl up. Yeah! See, honey, the game is called Braille. The idea is to find your wife by the Braille method. You know, like as though we were blind, which we usually are. With any luck, it gets us there. Won't have any trouble finding her. Get out of here. What's the matter? I said get out of here, all of you. You're kidding. I'm sick of you, you're rotten! ?Everybody get out of here! He isn't kidding. All right. Come on over there. Come on. You killed joy. Nina, ?where is Nina? No. It's me, it's Liz. You called me earlier. No, I... I didn't call you. Last time I talked to you was... Today at the office. I haven't... I haven't been to your office in a week. Don't you...? Again. Don't you...? No wonder you don't remember. Listen to me. We've got to go to the police. We've got to tell them about San Francisco. Everything. Tell them what? What about San Francisco? I'll help you to remember. Trust me. Come on. Good evening. Beer. What kind of beer? Doesn't matter. Evening, se?orita. Good evening. Another one. Thank you. Five pesos. Five pesos. Five pesos. Five pesos. Thieve! Pay me! Five pesos. Pay me, thieve! Police! Police! What happened? Hey stop! He's dead. Yes, Sir. Right, Lieutenant, I'll send them in. That door. What is it? Lieutenant, I've got to talk to you. It's about Mr. Jameson. I think I know about Mr. Jameson. Mr. Jameson, it's not your fault. I told the Lieutenant. I told him you are a good man. I told him what happened with Mrs. Jameson. Please, forgive me. Forgive me. Lieutenant, there's more to it than that. He was involved in the robbery at the San Francisco Airport a few days ago. We know about that too. Some foreign fellows were picked up near here just a few minutes ago. We know the whole story. Come on in. Do you think the money's here, Matt? Yes, I... I think so. Where exactly? I think... Up there. Come on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Nina... Nina... ?Nina! I remember. I remember it all now, Lieutenant. I buried her. I buried Nina. And the money, Matt. Where's the money? Vince has the money. He took it to Mexico with him. Lieutenant... We'll take you home, miss. He'd be all right, I think. He seemed to snap to when he... I know, I heard. We'll find out the truth, miss. The right thing will be done. Thanks, Lieutenant.
