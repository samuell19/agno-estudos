Previously on Chase - US Marshals, hands in the air. - This is a private party. We've got a warrant to search the premises. And for Pablo Cordova's arrest. Hey, Isabella didn't just take down Max Ramirez; she killed two of my guys. Anything happens to my wife, I will blame you. It's a tracker. O'Neil knew that Perez was gonna have this briefcase when he met the new witness. Dan O'Neil's an assistant U.S. attorney. Everybody's got a price. Dan O'Neil. You're under arrest. Hello? This is Deputy U.S. Marshal Annie Frost, and your son will face the death penalty for eight counts of murder, unless you turn yourself in. Here she is. Go! Put your hands on the car. Isabella, what are you doing here? We had a deal. Matthew! Isabella. ♪ ♪ Chavez. I like being engaged. Mmm... Me, too. No. No. They can live without you for an hour. I can't. Mmm. This is... Let me just... Let me just... No. This is Jimmy. Hey, now, you listen to me. I'll be there in ten minutes. You hear me? Diles que estamos aqui. La tenemos. Vamonos rapido. Si, senor. In here. Put her in the trunk. Bitch broke my nose. Go home, Chavez. And torch that car. Mr. Cordova, words cannot bring back a wife, a son. Comfort can be felt in knowing that they are now in the Kingdom of Heaven. May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed through the grace of God rest in peace. U.S. Marshals! Get down. Out of the way. Where is she? Where is she? I'm burying my wife and child. Where is my partner? Your men didn't cover their tracks, Pablo. We know it was you. Then prove it. Jimmy, come here. It's all right. You want to fight? Come here! Jimmy, Jimmy, not here, not here. Not this way. Not this way. Jimmy, I didn't know you were married. Good to know. You better let her go, or you're a dead man. I'm already dead. This is harassment. Stay away from my client. Oh, you again? Jimmy, let's go. We warned him. It's your one warning. It's your one warning. Get 'em out of here! Get 'em out of here! Think we rattled him? Yeah, with any luck, he'll be calling Hector now. And we'll track the call right to Annie. Quitalo. Welcome. Pablo Cordova wants you to see where you will die. Cuidado. Es una combatiente. Pongenla! Hopefully, we have better luck with the SUV. The owner reported it stolen from the parking lot of the Houston Galleria. That mall has cameras everywhere. Yeah? I had the tapes brought over. You guys want to tell me why I'm missing my kid's football game? Hey, Frank, you want to give us a minute? Thanks. What is it? Annie's been kidnapped. What? By the Allende Cartel. You're one of only five people who know. My lips are sealed. What can I do to help? Owner said he parked in the Green Lot, Level Two. Arrived about 7:30. Right there. That's the SUV that hit Annie's car. Looks like they're staking out which car they're gonna get. Something big enough to ram Annie's Escalade. Can you get the plate off the Trans Am? Yeah, yeah. Here's hoping it isn't stolen. It's not. It's registered to a... Peter Chavez. He lives in Fondren Southwest. Run him through the JIMS database. Got it. He's got a record. Possession With Intent to Sell? Yeah, and look where he was arrested. NightLight Club. That's one of Cordova's places. We just found one of Annie's kidnappers. Man in his 20s. And we believe that he works here. Goes by the name of Peter Chavez. Peter Chavez! U.S. Marshals! Put him on the car. Where's Annie Frost? Who? Where?! I don't know who you're talking about. We got you on tape. You're done. You're looking at the death penalty. Tell us what you know right now! I'm not telling you jack. I want my lawyer. Oh, yeah? Well, you can't have one. So, we're gonna bring the U.S. Attorney's Office in on this, right? Get them to offer a deal? We turn him in, and he'll never flip on Cordova. Last guy who did ended up in a barrel. Well, what other option do we have? We hand him over to the Satevo Cartel. They'll find out what we need to know. Jimmy, we can't do that. That son of a bitch has got information that could lead us to Annie. You hear me? Look, I care about Annie just as much as you do. Okay, but you're talking about breaking the law... Listen, if you're worried about your ass, then go back to the bullpen and you stay the hell out of my way. Jimmy, why would the Satevos help us? Because they're at war with Cordova, and helping us means hurting him. We cross the line, no coming back. Look, guys, playing the cartels against each other is the only chance we have to get Annie back alive. They're gonna kill him. We don't know that. Looks like you're the odd guy out, Luke. We need to bring in the chief, get other agencies involved... You listen to me. You want Annie killed, huh? Then go blow the whistle. You make sure that doesn't happen. Yeah. Let's go. Hey. I hope you're right about this. Me, too. No! No! No! Hola? QuiÃn estáahi? I-I don't speak Spanish. My name's Annie. What's yours? Tim. How old are you, Tim? If they hear us talking, they'll hurt us. How'd you get here? They took me from my house. Why? My dad. He's a prosecutor in Houston. What's his name? I-I work there as a... as a U.S. Marshal. D-Dan O'Neil. Do you know him? No. But I'm sure he misses you very much. How long have you been here, Tim? I started counting 42 days ago. Hmm... Leave your guns here. That's not gonna happen. Jorge, it's okay. Let them in. Thanks, Jorge. Zolo. Martinez. Long time. Been a while. Mm-hmm. Orale. Uh... Lot of soldiers here, Zolo. You may have heard. I'm in the middle of a business dispute. We were told that Cordova offered a million dollars for your head. Maybe you shouldn't have killed his family. Your friend has a very funny way of asking for help. I'm not asking. My partner was kidnapped by Cordova, and I want to know where she is. Am I Cordova? How is this my problem? Once the word gets out that a U.S. Marshal was kidnapped by a drug cartel, it'll become your problem, Zolo. It's gonna bring down a lot of heat. On all the cartels. Every agency in the country's gonna be crawling up your ass. It's gonna be bad for business, Zolo... It's gonna cost you millions. So? What do you want? Information. Give me a call when he talks. Tim? Who brings you food here? Victor. He brings us rice once a day. Does Victor do that by himself? Or does he bring a guard with him? Tim? You got to help me. So I can help us. If you help me, I promise you, you are going to see your parents again. Now, tell me about Victor. Allende soldiers. No backbone. What did he say? Deputy Frost is still alive. But she's not in the country anymore. You better not be lying to me. Cordova had her taken to Mexico. Where in Mexico? Chavez didn't know. Believe me. If he had, he would have said something. But he did say that Cordova had left orders for her to remain alive. He's going to ransom her? To kill her. But he wants to do it himself. I should've killed the son of a bitch when I had a chance. Maybe you still should. If Cordova gets to Mexico, your partner is dead. You're trying to get an arrest warrant for Cordova? News travels fast. Well, the judge released him yesterday for lack of evidence. You better have something juicy. Nothing you can use, Perez. Come on. DEA spent the last 22 months building a case against Cordova. Tell me what you got. You don't want to ask. Okay. I won't. But Melissa Randolph will. Our new acting U.S. Attorney isn't the rule-bending type. She doesn't want to end up in prison like her ex-boss. Right. You have evidence that Cordova's about to commit a murder, but you won't tell me how you know, and who he's gonna kill? Sounds promising. Look, we can't divulge our source. You think lawyers don't deal with confidential informants, too? Ma'am, with all due respect, until everyone in this office is clear of the allegations... My boss was the one selling info to the Allende Cartel. I can vouch for everyone in this office. Cordova can and will get to anybody. We can't risk it. And I can't ask a judge to issue an arrest warrant with no probable cause. We're talking about a person's life. And you're giving me nothing to work with. I'm sorry. Right. You know what? Screw the warrant. I'm gonna arrest Cordova. I'm in. One of us has got to come out of this with our badge. All right? Jimmy, I'm in. Hey, Jimmy. What? I got an old speeding ticket that Cordova never paid. Webb County. '97. I know it's a penny ante charge, but it's something. Nice, Perez. Hello? Yeah. Okay, thanks. That was Bouf. TOG picked up a call. Cordova's having his plane fueled. Bastards think they can just fly down to Mexico and kill Annie, huh? There he is. Let's cancel his flight. Get out of the car! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Get out of your car! My client stays in the vehicle. There's your warrant. Now, get out of my way. Yo, Ricky Martin, back in the car, brother. All right, go. I got them, come on. An unpaid speeding ticket? You guys really are desperate. Put your hands on your head. I'll have him out in 15 minutes. Yeah? Pablo Cordova, you're under arrest. Let's go. Come on. You been walking around your cell? Stretching your legs, like I told you? Yeah. Yeah. Good. Let's go. I'm scared. I am, too. Tim... It's time to go home. Okay. Okay. Close the door. ♪ ♪ Come on. Come here. Get down. Get down beside that car. Stay down, Tim. Get in the car. Tim. Hey, that was a smart move. Thank you. Pablo quiere que ella este viva! You hear that? Get down. One disagreement and you guys cut me out of the loop? What the hell are Jimmy and Marco doing? I don't know what you're talking about. Really? 'Cause I just got a call from the acting U.S. Attorney. She said that Jimmy and Marco arrested Cordova and disappeared. Keep your voice down. Look, Cordova's lawyer is raising hell. Okay, he called the Department of Justice and now the U.S. Attorney's calling me, and I don't like lying to her. How can you lie? You don't know anything. I know that Annie's been kidnapped. You didn't tell her that. No, but maybe I should have. Just tell her to call Jimmy. She called Jimmy, okay, and Marco and you. No one's answering. Look, Daisy, please, just tell me what's going on. Annie's been taken to Mexico. What? She's being held until Cordova can get across the border. He wants to kill her himself. Oh, my God. How long have you known about this? Jimmy called me an hour ago. And you didn't think I should know? You didn't think I could help? That's not what this is about. So what's Jimmy's plan? He's just going to hold on to Cordova? How are we going to find Annie? Jimmy's questioning Cordova right now. No, no, we can't do it like this. Okay, we got to do this the right way. I'm gonna call my father. No, don't. He's got friends at the CIA. If anyone can get Annie out alive... If this turns into an international incident, then Annie is dead. That's Jimmy talking. He's right, so don't make me regret telling you, Luke. Back in Narco, I used to hear stories about how Cordova used to torture people. The cartels corrupted my partner. They deserve what they get. How come I never heard about your partner, Marco? Because on the record, he was a good cop shot in the line of duty. So you couldn't tell the truth? He had a family. If the truth came out... They wouldn't get their benefits. I visit them sometimes, tell the kids stories about their dad. It's like I said, they deserve what they get. Hey. Annie didn't kill your family. The Satevo Cartel did. I'll deal with the Satevos. Not if I hand you over to 'em. You can't do that. Oh, yeah? You're a U.S. Marshal. Yeah? Hey. Have you heard from your man Chavez lately? How do you think I know that Annie's in Mexico? Okay. So long. Wait. Wait? Wait. What, what? Give me a phone and I'll tell them to let her go. Oh, yeah? You'll tell them to kill her. You think I'm stupid? You think I'm stupid?! You tell me where she is! Thanks... for getting me out back there. Don't thank me yet. We still got to get off this road and switch cars. Why? Why not just keep driving? I chase fugitives for a living. A known vehicle is the easiest one to spot. ♪ ♪ Hablas ingles? Some. You got a phone? What about a cell phone? You got one of those, I'll pay you. Only that phone. Sorry. Tim, grab some food, whatever you want. I need you to show me where I... Get down. Tim. Damn it. Hide us. I don't want trouble, huh? They find us in here... you die. Hola. Estamos buscando dos Americanos. Una rubia y un nino. Lo siento. No los he visto. Cuatro paquetes de cigarrillos. Si usted los ve, llama a la policia. Si, senor, claro. You okay? Yeah. You know those police work for the Allende Cartel. Of course. You tell 'em we were here, they're going to punish you for lying. I won't tell them. I need your car. Hey, Perez, what are you doing here? I'm meeting with Jimmy. Jimmy's here? Hey, Daisy, can I see you in the briefing room, please? Yeah. It's okay, we got it handled. Jimmy, he knows. So this is where they're holding Annie... in a compound 75 miles south of Laredo. Now that we have her exact location, we can send our own people to extract her. We're going to need the DEA to send in a chopper, okay? Well, I got guys we can trust. I'll see how fast they can mount a rescue. How fast can they move? Best case scenario... eight to ten hours. No, that's not good enough. We're in a meeting. Deputy, I need you to answer some questions about Pablo Cordova. Sure, some other time. Now. Annie. Damn it. Go back, please. Okay, Calle Ruiz. Let's hope this goes north. A dead end. Yeah, we're going to wait it out in there. We can't just break into someone's house. Well, I doubt anybody lives in there. I'll take the car, put it around back, check it out inside. Stay there. See? Told you it was empty. Whoever it was left in a hurry. Where is Pablo Cordova? Marco is booking him now. Where? In Webb County. He's driving him halfway across Texas on a speeding ticket? Yeah, a warrant's a warrant. Deputy, what the hell is going on here? Jimmy, you got a second? Yeah. Excuse me. Annie's on the phone. I thought we could make it to the border. Did you say "we"? Yeah, I got someone with me... Tim O'Neil. Dan O'Neil's son? They kidnapped his son. Reason the U.S. Attorney became the cartel's mole. Yeah. Now they have a whole army looking for us. We pulled up Calle Ruiz on a map. We located your abandoned house. Please tell me there's another road out of here. The only road is the one you rode there on. Can you stay where you are until we get people to you? How long? Eight to ten hours. I don't know, guys. Uh, if they saw us turn down this road... I'll get you out in four. Four? Yeah, four. Okay. See you then. And, um, Jimmy... Yeah? These don't count as vacation days. All right. How the hell are you going to get her out in four hours? You can't keep breaking the law! Right now the law's not the most important thing. How many of those things you eating? Want one? No. Thank you. Hmm? Do you think... I could call my Dad? On that phone? Tim, I already told you... it'd just worry him. We'll call him when we get back. What if we don't get out? Please, can I just call him now? Listen, I got something to tell you. I do know your dad. I work with him. Why didn't you tell me? I got some bad news about him. Is he all right? He was arrested a few days ago. Why? He... Tim... the Allendes kidnapped you to force your dad to help them. And he did. No, he's... You-you're lying. No, I just wanted you to know, 'cause when you go back, you're going to hear some pretty ugly things. I wanted you to learn it from a friend first. Is he in jail? Is he? No, Tim. Damn it! Damn! No, no. Come back in the house! Get back in the house! Get back in the house. Get back in the house. Off of me! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Listen, hey. I'm sorry. Come on. We got to get back inside. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I don't want to die. Go get in the bathtub. Lie down flat. What? It's the safest place to be if the shooting starts happening. Wh-what about you? Just go! Vengan aqui, estan aqui! Bajan sus armas! Pablo quiere que ella este viva. Annie?! Just stay in the tub! Annie?! I'm here. What happened? I don't know. Just stay down. ZOLO Annie Frost?! I have a message for Boots! I made a deal with Jimmy Godfrey to get both of you over the border. In return for what? In return... This is all the evidence you need to convict Pablo Cordova and the Allende Cartel. You will deliver it to the DEA. You want us to wipe out your competition for you. This time, Cordova won't have any witnesses to kill. He'll go to prison... and you will be a hero. If you take over Cordova's territory, we're coming after you next. It's a pleasure doing business with you. I'm not gonna forget what you did. Well, I'm not gonna forget what you didn't do. I hope these guys know how to keep their word.

You mean, if I'm going to make a deal with the devil. Uh, I looked it over... Was it worth getting our hands dirty? When you deal with the cartels... Nobody stays clean. So, are we done?
