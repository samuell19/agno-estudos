No, we're not done yet. I need some water. - Be right back. - Okay. Travis? Travis. Travis? There you are. I like the way you think. This is Ellie. The opposing council said what? Well, that's ridiculous. He infringed on not one but four of our clients' patents, and they're filing for validity? Are you kidding me? They may as well cut the check now. Yes. I understand what you're saying, but time is of the essence. Well, I'm actually back in Oceancrest. Marcus and I are still unpacking. Yes, it's very exciting. He's doing well, much better. Thanks for asking. Yeah. I think we're all set. I will be in the office... first thing in the morning, and we know what to do. Yes, that sounds perfect. Okay. Yeah, I'll speak with you in the morning. Bye-bye. Marcus, I'm here. Honey? So much for waiting. Yeah, sorry. It just showed up this morning, so I threw it together. It's not much, but it's starting to feel like home. Aw. I remember when Brit won this at the fair. I miss her. Well, look, Berkeley's only an hour away. Okay? She'll be home for fall break before you know it. Yeah. This is a big lifestyle change, you know. Do you think it was a mistake leaving the city? No, I don't think it was a mistake. I mean, we came right out of college to having Brittany, and... busy career, so... it's our time. -You're stuck with me. -Stuck with you? Once, of course, your case is over, that is. Ellie Warren. Hey! Ellie! I'm so late. Freeway was a parking lot. I just figured you guys had a late night, first night in the house. Well, the house is new, but the man is not. -How about happy hour tonight? -Can't. I am dying to get my flirt on, and I need my wing woman. -I know, but Marcus is cooking. -You see, that is exactly what I need. So, tomorrow, then? We'll get drunk and bitch about our respective firms. Do you know how crazy traffic is gonna be on a Friday night? Yeah, it's gonna be a nightmare. It's always a nightmare. Get over it. I won't take no for an answer. Bye. Good morning. Good morning. This is our lead counsel, Ellie Warren, who I am hoping we can all persuade to reconsider and stay at the firm after this is closed. This is the tech consultant I was telling you about, David Hammond. Ellie. David, hi. -How you doin'? -I'm good. You two know each other? Yeah, we, we actually went to college together. - Yeah. - It's been a long time? It sure has. Twenty years. You look like it's been 20 minutes. Well... Okay, as I was telling David, our client alleges that the patents belonging to Mr. Moore, the defendant, infringe on four of our client's provisionals. In addition to that, Mr. Moore seems to be in possession of certain proprietary information that he could only have gotten from our client's patent counsel. -Ellie, your thoughts? -Thank you. It appears that Mr. Moore's nephew was working as a clerk at that time, which means he would have had easy access to confidential information. You do realize that any relevant communications I acquire from the defendant and his nephew will be inadmissible. You just find those e-mails and let me worry about how to handle him. I'll find them. They warned me your boss was a shark. Maybe next time, you should bring a cage. I can't get over how great you look. -Thank you. -Wait, hold on. There. Thanks. Well, I have another meeting to run to, but, um, we should catch up. Yeah, I would like that. How about tonight? Actually, tonight, I would have to take a rain check. Not gonna make me wait another 20 years, are you? Um, no, that, I will not do. Here's my card. Call me anytime. I'm gonna hold you to that. -It was really good to see you, Ellie. -Welcome to the team. I'll do some shopping this week. Maybe fire up the grill over the weekend. Sounds good. The wine is great. Thank you. Yeah, you know, I think this firm is gonna be... a really good fit for me. They let me take over a project from another architect, so it'll be... good to get back on the horse, as they say. Well, that's amazing. Just make sure you take your time because you're still in recovery. Have a seat. Your friend's a miracle worker. Already, he has uncovered damaging correspondence from Mr. Moore. All of that in a day? Actually, it only took a few hours, but I wanted to bring it to you in person. Look at this. So, do you think they'll settle? If we play our cards right. -This calls for celebration. -Yeah. Drinks tonight? I can't. - Again. - No, I promised my girlfriend Courtney I'd meet her for happy hour. Girls' night. I get it. Yeah, I'm sorry. But you know what? -You should actually come with us. -No, I couldn't impose. David, you should. It'll be fine. She will not mind. -You sure? -Yes. Where? Nolan's. Seven o'clock? -It's a date. -Good. Nice work today. -Thank you. -See ya. Bye-bye. Like another? Hey, where are you? I'm here. Okay, look, don't kill me, but I have to finish this brief before I leave. We go to trial next week. Courtney, are you serious? I promise I'll make it up to you. I understand. Um, well, I guess I'll see you later, then. All right, see you soon. Bye. Hey, Ellie. David, hey. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. I have a booth in the back for us. Um, is your friend... Courtney, no. That was actually just her. She's stuck at the office, and she won't be able to make it. I guess I have you all to myself then. - Just a little. - Okay. Wow. You're many things, Ellie Brooks, but I've never known you to be a woman who couldn't keep up. It's "Warren." Right, right. Mrs. Warren. Yes. So what's this about Janice saying you're leaving the firm? So, my husband and I, we just bought a new house in Oceancrest. And, as soon as I finish this case, I'm gonna start my own practice. - Wow. - Yeah. Living the dream. It's exciting. And my daughter, she just started her first year in college, so it feels like a good time to go. -No way you have a daughter in college. -I absolutely have a daughter in college. Wanna see? There she is. Wow. She's beautiful. Thank you. Has your eyes. Yeah, that's my girl. So... So what about you? Wife? Girlfriend? Children? What's your story? Divorced, no kids. Um, I guess we all can't be as lucky as you are. Unless there's trouble in paradise? No trouble. I do. I do have the perfect life, the perfect husband, the perfect daughter, the perfect home. But, you know, one day, you wake up 20 years later, and you realize the person sleeping next to you feels like a complete stranger. I don't know how that happens. Twenty years is a long time. But I'm pretty sure he's still attracted to you. I don't know. But look, I don't wanna dump all my drama on you. No. No, we're just catching up. Okay. Janice? Marcus. Mr. Warren. Yes. If you have to leave, I totally understand. No. I'm good. -Another bottle of wine, then. -Um... If we stay here drinking, people are gonna start talking. Where would you like to go? I don't know. Twenty years ago? So, tell me, how come you and I never dated? Well, probably because you were too busy dating those other guys. -Maybe I was just waiting for you to ask. -Maybe I didn't wanna get my heart broken. Well, maybe we were just preserving the friendship. I'll drink to that. To friendship. You're a bad influence. But let's say... What if I had asked you out? Would you? Well, I don't know that I remember you looking this good back then. I got a confession to make. Please. I knew you worked with the firm before I took the job. -Really? -Yeah. Janice inquired about my services. I found out you worked there. I figured it'd be fun for us to catch up, work together, you know. -I hope you don't mind. -No, no. Not at all. I gotta tell you, if things had worked out differently... you would never feel like you're sleeping with a stranger. If only. Do you trust me? No, I don't trust you. Come on. Ellie... No. No, David. I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I have to go. Ellie! Ellie. I gotta go home, David. To the complete stranger sleeping in your bed? -I never should have said that. -Listen, you deserve to be with a man who appreciates you. I needed tonight, but that should have never happened. My car is here. Good night, David. Hey, babe. -Didn't hear you come in. -Hey. Thank you. This is amazing. It's exactly what I was looking for. So, David, as I recall, the last time you were here, you weren't doing so well. Yeah, I know, doc. But the good news is I'm fine now. - Really? - Yeah. Work is good. I'm sleeping again, going to the gym. -I've even started seeing someone. -There it is. Yeah. She's a lawyer. -Is she? -Yeah. The thing is, she's just getting out of a long-term relationship, so we're gonna take things slow. Give her some space, you know? David, do you remember when you first came to see me for your court-ordered anger management? You told me how broken you were over Deborah. Yeah. Do you still feel that way? Why do you keep bringing that up? I... I told you I was over it now. Because, after what you've been through, I don't think anyone would blame you if you were still having problems. Hello? Mom? Dad? Wow. Wow. There she is. Dad, where did you find this? I keep all your old stuff, baby. Welcome to your new home. Thank you, Dad. I've been looking forward to this fall break. Aw, we missed you. - Missed you, too. - We missed you so much. So, what do you think? It's pink. - She doesn't like it. - She doesn't. Well, we can change whatever you don't like. We just wanted you to have something special to walk into. Aw, thank you. But wait, did you see the private beach though? - 'Cause that might fix everything. - I think it might. Yeah. -Come on. Let's go see. Come on. -Okay, let's go. Hey, sweetie. Mom! So, what do you think? You did it. New job. New house. Dad's smiling again. Now I can breathe. Come on, admit it. You miss the city. I don't know. Mark my words. You'll get sick of writing wills for rich old ladies, and you'll be back. You'll be back. They always come back. -See you later. -Bye. Mwah. -Bye. -Yeah, bye. One second. Ellie? David. -Hey. -Wow. I just left a meeting across the street, and I thought to myself, she looks like Ellie. You look great. Thank you. Look, I'm just gonna come right out and say it. About that night, I apologize. No, it's... it's totally fine. You don't need to apologize. It was late. We both had too much to drink. It should've never happened. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought you might be angry or something. -You know? -Why? Why would I be angry? I'm... I'm fine. Well, you haven't returned my phone calls. Hold on a minute. Sorry, sir. How about we grab a coffee and talk? My treat. I... I, um... I actually just had a coffee, -but thanks. -Okay, just talk then? I've got an hour before my next meeting, and I wanna hear all about your new firm. I can't, David. I am married. It's not okay. I said wait a goddamn minute. Hey, are you moving or not? I get it. But things don't have to be awkward between us. I just want you to know... I'm here for you. I appreciate that, David. Take care. Shit! Hey, baby. Hi! I didn't even hear you come in. - What happened? You all right? - I just cut my finger. Does it hurt? A little bit. Mwah. How about that? Better? Maybe. -That's better. -That's better. Thank you. Wait, wait, you know what? It's been a really long day. I think I... I need more. You have a visitor. Hi. Hi. What a nice surprise. Thank you. You're welcome. Wow! Looks like you're getting settled. I'm trying. We're almost there. Wow, this looks really good on you. I've never seen you look so relaxed at work. It's amazing how effective I can be at my job when there aren't millions of dollars at stake. How's that? Sweet enough? It's okay. Okay? Madam, I will have you know that that... is the nectar of the gods. What do you say we take this desk for a spin? - That's not a bad idea. - The notary's here. - Sorry. - To be continued. To be continued. I'm so sorry about that, sir. Honey, don't forget we have dinner tonight. Courtney's coming over, Brittany's on a date, so it'll probably just be the three of us. Steak or salmon? Salmon. Done. -You must be here for my daughter. -Yeah. Scott, sir. Marcus Warren, FBI. Sir? Dad, you remember Scott? We went to high school together. Hey, Scott. Hey, Mrs. Warren. -How you doing? -Good. Thank you. -Good. Where you guys headed? -Dinner and a movie. Nice. So, be home at 11:00? Mom, I'm in college. I'll be home by 12:00. 11:00. How about 12:00? Have fun, baby. Thanks. Love you. Love you. Bye. Bye. I don't get a hug? See, it's starting already. Honey, I feel like maybe we should've ordered in. -I feel like I'm so behind. -No, no, this is perfect. Table's set for three. We're good. -Yeah? -Yeah. Okay. -She's here. -I got it. Hey, man. Marcus. - Welcome to our humble abode! - Wow! Beautiful. I hope you don't mind the last-minute plus-one. - No! Not at all. - Hey! You look beautiful. -How are you doing? You look gorgeous! -Hi. Hi, I'm David. Nice to meet you. Ellie. Before I forget. I figured white goes with everything. Yeah, man. Thank you. I like this guy already. Look at that, babe. -You guys want a tour? -Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, come on. Out here. - This is what sold it, so... - Whoa. ...I'll show you that first. I'll show you the... main attraction here. Watch yourself. Wow. So, David, listen, you gotta tell me. I'm familiar with tech consultant, but what's your lane? What's your specialty? Actually, I'm a hacker. Babe! He's consulted with some of the biggest firms in the city. Yeah, I'm the guy you hire when you need information that doesn't wanna be found. Aha! Well, it's legal though, right? It's "unofficial." I'm surprised your old firm never hired him. -Yeah. -How'd you two meet? -You wanna tell them, or... -No, no, you... -Okay. -You tell them. Okay. So, I'm waiting for the elevator one day, and up walks this very handsome, very confident man, and suddenly... it was like everyone else in the lobby just disappeared. I think I even heard music. Yep. So I introduced myself and... Yeah, and I was so captivated by her, I asked her out for lunch that afternoon. Here we are. Turns out, he'd just gone through a bad divorce. What happened? What's there to say? I had the perfect home, perfect wife. One day, you wake up, and it feels like the person you've been sleeping next to for 20 years is a complete stranger. Wow. That's gotta suck. Yeah. -Babe, you don't have to talk about it... -No, it's okay. It's okay. I mean, what hurt the most was, no matter how much time and effort I put in... she didn't take me seriously. Well, hey, onward and upward, right? Another toast. To new friends and happy relationships. -Cheers. -Cheers! Cheers! Anyone up for dessert? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Yeah. -Courtney, wanna come with me? -Yeah. -No, no, it's okay, baby. I'll get it. -You sure? -Yeah. -Okay. This guy. Are you crazy? How dare you show up at my house. You don't return my calls. You don't return my texts. -How else am I supposed to reach you? -You're not supposed to. You don't have to worry. Our secret is safe. My husband... My husband is outside. Do you not see what I'm willing to do for you? Don't you touch me. -This could work. -I don't know what you think this is, but I want you to go outside right now and come up with an excuse as to why you need to leave early. And I don't ever wanna see you around me, my daughter, my husband, or my home ever again. Do you understand? Just got off the phone with a client. The file I was working with got corrupted, so, and they need it tonight. So I gotta go. Courtney, I can take you home. No. No, that's okay. I don't want you to have to drive all the way back by yourself. That's... It's fine. -Call me. -Yeah. -What's wrong? Everything okay? -No, I'm fine. Hi, you've reached Courtney. Leave a message. Courtney, it's Ellie, and I need you to call me back. I've left you so many messages. I need to talk to you. Hey, Mom. What's this? - Call me back. ! "Forget Me Nots." I remember this song. Where did you get this? I actually found it in a box in the garage. This could be worth some real money. If you don't want it, I'll take it. -I'll keep it. -Okay. -Hey. -Don't! I know you're upset. You seduce my friend? You show up at my house? You've crossed the line, David. I get it. I get it. You wanna be discreet. -No one has to know about us. -Us? There is no us! Would your husband think that? If you even think about calling my husband... I'm not saying that I would, but I could. Come on, Ellie. Tell me that night didn't unlock something inside of you. I mean, look at you. We did it! You know what? I've tried to be considerate of your feelings and respectful of our friendship, but what is it gonna take? -For what? -For you to stay away from me, my family, and Courtney. And make the same mistake we made 20 years ago? David, the only mistake I made was getting caught up in the moment that night. I am warning you, David. You've gotta stay the hell... Who do you think you're talking to, Deborah? Who the hell is Deborah? David? David. Look. Okay, listen. I know that we have had some amazing memories in the past, and I am just asking you to please... let's leave the past where it is. This has got to stop. I need you to leave me alone. Hey. Hey. What's wrong? He told me everything on the way home. So you basically just let me sit through that whole dinner and make a fool out of myself. Courtney, that is not true. I tried to tell you. Tell me what? David is unstable. He's unstable? You come on to him in the middle of a nightclub, rip his clothes off in the bathroom, but he's unstable? You then invite him to lunch, scream at him in front of the entire restaurant, -but he's unstable? -No, wait. I'm sorry. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What exactly did he tell you? The truth. How you wanted to have an affair ever since Janice hired him, but he turned you down. How you've been trying to seduce him... ever since you found out I was seeing him. No, that is not true. You know me better than anyone. I would never do that to you. Really? You wouldn't do that to me? Explain that. Wait a minute, no. He sent these messages to me. He must have just switched the names. I didn't do that. You know, he didn't even wanna show them to me because he knows what these would do to your marriage if they ever got out. And you believe him. You actually believe the guy... who sat with us at dinner and told us both that he was a hacker. If he wanted you to know so badly that he and I were having an affair, why do you think he waited so long to tell you? Because apparently, he's the only one who cares about your marriage. I really don't know why I bothered to even come down here. - Wait. - My God. I'm... I'm just gonna go. -Courtney! -No. No. Thanks for your complete honesty. -Really nice, Ellie. Really nice. -Wait, Courtney. Listen to me. Are you telling me, right now, that you really believe that there's nothing wrong? I definitely believe there's something wrong here. Courtney, you're being ridiculous. I would not lie to you. Courtney. Courtney! Linda, if anyone calls, I'm heading into the city for a few hours. Okay. But I need those papers on my desk by Friday at 2:00 p.m., Desiree. - Ellie! Hi! - Hi. How are you? -It's so good to see you. -You too. Professor Nicole. I don't know that I'm ever gonna be able to get past that. God. I can't believe how good you look! What are you, hiding one of those portraits in the attic? -What's your secret? -I left the city. Yeah, that'll do it. Brittany told me about Marcus. He's getting better? Yeah, he's doing good. Slowly but surely. -Thanks for asking. -God, it's so funny you call. I was just going through old photos for the retrospective. -Really? -Yeah. What brings you up this way? David Hammond. What about him? A friend of mine is, looking for a consultant, and I knew you were friends. And I was just wondering what you thought of him. I mean, I don't remember much. Just that he was smart, kinda quiet though. Then, of course, that he was totally obsessed with you. He was? Yeah, come on. Wait, you didn't notice? No, actually. No. That's right. Because you only had eyes for Marcus, all hot and sweaty in his Stanford uniform. Well, yeah, that I remember. But you must remember David's ex-wife, Deborah, right? No. I don't... I don't know that I've... I've met Deborah. Really? She looked just like you. -Really? -Yeah. So, why did they get a divorce? I... I mean, look, David was a nice guy, you know. Handsome, accomplished. But off the record... Deborah told me he had a crazy temper. And he was super controlling and just crazy jealous. Wish... I wish I could hear her side of the story. Ellie, she's dead. What? A couple months after the divorce, someone broke into her new boyfriend's place, killed them both. My God. Was David ever considered a suspect? Yeah, they investigated him, of course. But, I mean, at the end of the day, the police decided it was just a robbery. Apparently, the new boyfriend was a dealer, had a bunch of cash lying around the house. Ellie, what's this really about? My God. Courtney, hi, it's Ellie. Please call me when you get this message. I have some information I think you need to know. Call me on my cell. I'll be in the office as well. All right. Bye. Love you. Come in. -Hey, Mom. -Hey, sweetie. You're up early. - Yeah, Scott's coming over. - Okay. -Is everything okay? -Um, yeah. You know what? Give me a hug. Why? I need it. - Morning. - Morning! - Any messages? - Your 10:30 confirmed. Okay. If Courtney calls, pull me from whatever I'm doing. No problem. And if this guy shows up, call the police. Sure. So the good news is I'm finally starting to get some clients of my own instead of just proofing. That's great, Dad. Yeah. You remember that job I did in Palo Alto? Babe? Mom? - You remember the job I did in Palo Alto? - Yeah. Well, it turns out that guy bought some land here and wants me to design a building for him. That's amazing, honey. Yeah. Looks like things might be finally turning around. Everything okay, Mom? Yeah, no. I'm... I'll get it. No, no. I got it. -You okay? -Yeah, no, I'm fine. Um... I need to call my office. Be right back. Hey. How did you get it? Ellie, if I can break into one of the top e-mail service providers in the country for you, I can definitely hack into a nightclub for me. You give me one reason why I shouldn't call the police and get a restraining order. Well, I wonder what would happen if I sent that video to Marcus. I wonder what would happen if the world knew what really happened to your ex-wife. I'm not giving up on us, Ellie. David? David. Shit. Hi! You've reached Courtney. Leave a message. Courtney. It's Ellie. Please call me as soon as you get this message. I need to talk to you. So how was your day? It was great. You're so sweet. Babe. What is it? Sexy. Sure you wouldn't rather see me in less? It's no rush. Okay. I guess I'll see you in a minute. What do you think? Beautiful. Tell me you love me. - You did all this time, tell me. - I love you. Yeah, I want you. I'm yours. Don't go. I'm gonna miss you. Yeah. Promise. Okay. See you later. -Call me. -I will. God. Hey, David. Hey. Hope you weren't waiting long. Hey. No, man. Not at all. Gotta tell you, I was surprised when I got your call this morning, man. I never thought I'd get a chance to play this course. It's amazing. You're gonna love it. There it is. Good one. Thanks, man. Tell you, it's the putter. Thing damn near putts itself. Elle got it for me for my birthday last year. She really seems like a great woman. I'd love to hear your secret. Well, I'll tell you. A marriage counselor once told us that you have to approach marriage as a series of little marriages. So you two are in counseling? No, no. Not anymore. We were, but... that was before I got hurt. Mind if I ask what happened? No, no. Not at all. I was riding my bike over Glen Canyon, like I do every morning. I must have veered off the road or something, I'm not really sure, but I never saw or heard the truck. Week later, I woke up in the hospital, broken collarbone, couple cracked ribs. I was in a body cast for six months. - Ouch. - Yeah. It was tough at first. It's getting better. Everything is. Work's great. Things with Ellie are a lot better. You're a lucky guy. She's beautiful, successful. A lot of guys would kill to have a woman like that. Thanks, man. I'm just saying. You have no idea what it's like to see the woman you love touching another man, kissing another man, wondering if she really loves him. What you might do if you got that man alone. Hey, man. Sorry to hear about your wife, too. Ex. Ex-wife. Yeah, well, either way. Hey, there. How you doing? It was, man. It was good stuff, man. I appreciate the call. Let's do it again. -Absolutely. We will. -All right. -Hi. -Hi. How can I help you? I'm not sure if you remember me from this morning, but I'm a friend of, um, David Hammond's. Um, I left a few things in his place last night. So, I was just wondering if you could let me into his apartment. We've all had those nights. My God. No, no, no. Hey, babe. Golf was really fun. Yeah. You on the way home from work? You want me to pick up some dinner? Okay. Headed to you right now. Answer the phone. Courtney! You've got about ten seconds until I hang up. Courtney, I think David killed his wife. That's not even remotely funny. Listen to me. I know you are upset with me. And you have every right to be. But David is not the man that you think he is. Everything from getting the job at the firm to dating you has all been to get to me. And you know this how? Because I went to his apartment. He had pictures of me on his computer. He's been watching me. Courtney, he's dangerous. I gotta go. No, Courtney, please! -Hey, baby. -Hey. Mwah. So, who were you talking to? What's that? When I was coming down the hall, I heard you talking to someone. Just a... a work call. It was nothing. Sounded pretty tense. You know how it is. Some people don't know - how to take no for an answer. - Tell me about it. You shouldn't go through other people's phones. What, why do you have photos of Ellie on there? You know we're old friends. Yeah, but these are new. Have you been following her? -Janice asked me to do it. -Her old boss? Yeah, she thought it was suspicious Ellie was leaving the firm so soon, so she asked me to make sure she wasn't compromising anything. Was she? Was she compromising anything? No. Yeah, I... I think I need some air. Everything's gonna be just fine. Courtney! Courtney. Courtney! God. Courtney! Courtney. Courtney, wake up, please. Courtney. God. Somebody, help! We sent units to his apartment, but he wasn't there. We'll find him. Okay. Is she gonna be all right? She's fine. Elle. Elle, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, honey. -Where's Brittany? -She's fine. She's with Scott. -Are you sure you're okay? -Yes, yes. You must be the husband. I'm Detective Larson. -Can you tell me what's going on? -Her friend was attacked. Attacked by who? What happened? I'm gonna send a unit to your house until we find him. In the meantime, if you need anything, anytime. Thank you. Babe, what happened? What's going on? I'm gonna tell you everything when we get home. -But please, get me out of here, okay? -Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, this guy's out here drinking my beer. I played golf with this son of a bitch! I don't get it. I don't get it. If you guys were so close, how come I never heard about him before? I haven't talked to him since I graduated from college. I haven't seen him since we graduated from college. And when he showed up at the house, I didn't know how... I... I didn't know how to tell you. So, you... you screw him in the bathroom? I'm sorry, you almost did. I was drunk. How do you do this to us, Elle? I just got caught in a situation, and I did not... I didn't know what to do. The last thing that I ever wanted to do was hurt you. I'm sorry. If you were so upset about the way things were going, why didn't you say something? Because I didn't know what to say. I didn't know how to say it. I did not... -I didn't know how to tell you anything. -Elle! I don't understand how you can make a living talking to 12 people in a jury box that you don't even know... and you can't talk to me? I mean, Jesus, is our life really that bad? No. No, I love our life. I love our daughter. I love the life that we've built together. I love you. I... I'm sorry. Mom. Dad. Why are there police cars outside? Come sit, baby. What's wrong? Dad? Just sit down. So, the use of an accelerant is gonna make DNA tests very difficult, and the dental samples are gonna take a while to reconstruct. Thank you. However, both the handwriting on the letter and the clothing on the body appear to be a match for David. Yeah. We searched the apartment, and we found the folders that you mentioned. There were also a number of searches on the computer about suicide. Apparently, he left a message on his therapist's voicemail last night, taking responsibility for everything... including the murder of his ex-wife. My God. I know this isn't quite the resolution you were hoping for. But it is a resolution. Yeah. Um, thank you. Thank you for everything you've done. -We appreciate you. -Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Detective. How's Courtney? Is there an update? She's doing better. I took her statement this morning. She's got stitches, a bad concussion, but the doctor said she should be ready to receive visitors tomorrow. Thank you so much. Marcus, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all of it. You know, I remember... the first day that I realized I was in love with you. It was like, in that moment, everything just... made sense. I can't tell you that I'm not angry. And I can't tell you that I'm not hurt. But what I can say is... that I will always need you... for my world to make sense. So... I told you before, I'll tell you again, I guess you're stuck with me. I think we're stuck with each other. Good catch. Low coastal clouds will be rolling in later tomorrow afternoon... -Hey, babe. -Hey. Look at this. It's perfect. There's no way I'm going in to the office today. Don't. You know? We have so much to be thankful for. I know what I'm thankful for. You want some tea? -Yeah. -All right, I'll get some. ...after murdering his ex-wife and her boyfriend, as well as stalking an Oceancrest woman and her family. David is a textbook definition of narcissistic personality disorder. All right, guys. We gotta get that thing in first thing in the morning, all right? Eight hours. Stick it full. Shoot. It's Linda. I need to go to the office and sign some documents before the holiday. -It's almost dark. -No, I know. I'll be quick. All right. - Bye, guys. Have fun. - Bye. -Bring us a pizza. We're hungry. -I will. Hey, don't make me come down there now. Linda, I'm here! No. No. You left them alone. David. This is Detective Larson. David is still alive. Ellie? Slow down. Where are you now? I'm in my car. I'm driving to my house. No one's answering. Please. Get someone over there now. Ellie. Ellie! It's Detective Larson. I need units sent to 57 Shore Road immediately. Marcus! Brittany! This is such a great song, right? What are you doing? Remember that party senior year? They must have played this entire album, like, twice. Come on, dance with me. Come on. David, where's my husband? Where's my... Where's my daughter? I'm disappointed. You would think a man would put up much more of a fight for the woman that he loves. Marcus? Brittany? Ellie... I know you think you love him. But way down deep... you realize you made a mistake, and that's okay. We all make mistakes. The important thing is we can be together now. We can start a brand-new life. Maybe you're right. I knew you'd come around. It's like my psychiatrist used to say. Sometimes you just gotta put the past in the rearview mirror and move on. Yeah. I don't wanna hurt you. David, please! I just believe some things are worth fighting for. Marcus! Marcus! - Ellie! - Honey? - Marcus! - Help! God! Here. Sweetheart! God! Mom! Honey, are you okay? God. -Where is he now? -He's upstairs. Hold on. Lean forward. Here. Here. The police are here. He's upstairs. -Come on. -He's upstairs. Go. Go! Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on. Come on. -Scott! -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, come on! Elle, come on! Go! Hurry. Hey, we need help! - My God. - Hey, go see if you can call for help. I'll get Brittany out of here. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, get in the car. Get in the car. Brittany, get in the car! Hello? Is anyone there? Somebody, please, help me. Please, somebody. Can anyone hear me? Hello? Come here. Brittany, go! Let her go. Come on, babe. Come on! Go. Go. Go. Marcus. David, no! Ellie... I never meant for things to get out of hand. Please. David, please, put the gun down. Even now he's abandoning you. Okay. Okay. Okay, just calm down. Can't you see we were meant to be together? David. -Please. -Let me make it up to you. We'll start over. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? Honey, are you okay? David! No! No! I got you! David, hold on! I got you, Elle. I got you, baby. I got you. I got you. All right. So you're leaving us already? Well, you're not paying that tuition for me to sit around here, are you? I'm not. I'm not. I love you. Love you, too. Call me when you get there. And then every day after that so I know you're okay. I will. Don't worry. I'll be back before you know it. -Okay? Love you guys. -I love you, baby. - See you soon. - Bye. Drive safe. Put your seat belt on. I love you. I love you, too, babe. I'm so sorry. Stop. Stop. -Can't wait to get back to the city. -Yeah. Me, too. -Come on. I'll cook you some dinner. -Nice. Steak or salmon? Definitely steak.
