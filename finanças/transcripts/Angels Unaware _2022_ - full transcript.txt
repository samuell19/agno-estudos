Before The beginning, God created powerful archangels. After many years of peace and harmony, a war broke out as one of the archangels and his minions tried to remove God. They were exiled from heaven. God's greatest creation, humankind, is now being threatened by that archangel, my brother, Lucifer. I have been sent to earth to thwart his attacks. Judge Ceiver, well, well, well. Pastor Matt. How are you this fine evening? So many things going my way. How goes your ministry? I'm struggling. It's occupational hazard, I think. Hmm, it's not uncommon. Humans are flawed. I don't know if I can truly listen to, and love unconditionally all these inmates, you know? All these child molesters and murderers and rapists. Interesting. But aren't we just one act from being them ourselves? Looks like a storm's coming. Have a good night, judge. Good night. A storm, indeed. Well, I say let it pour. Come on! No, no, no, no. Hello. Hello? You belong to your father, and so shall carry out his desires. What? Hey, is this? As to the son from the father. The father of lies. Hey! Hey! Give it up, I know you're in here. Come on, man, there's no way out. Where the hell did you come from? What did he do? Who are you? Eden. Eden, what? Just Eden? - What? - I don't know. You wouldn't happen to have an extra phone in there, would you? I prefer face to face communication. Hey, would you like a cookie, Mac? How'd you know my name? Now, is that a no? Is what a no? No, you don't want a cookie. They're delicious. Who are you? I told you, Eden. Something about you. I don't know, you're not like the rest of them. Not like the rest of who? Not like the rest of the homeless people? Women? Black women? Humans? What are you doing up here anyway? Waiting for you. You do realize you're trespassing? And you do realize that you are no longer a cop, Brian MacDougal? Okay, I get it. You caught the news. What do you have, a newspaper, a TV in there or something? You don't know a thing about me. Ooh, you're carrying a lot of weight. And to think that you always dreamed about doing this when you were a child. Now your grandfather, and his father, they were both cops, right? Yep, and I wish they would've beat some sense into me. You're tired. And that's understandable after what happened. Who the hell do you think you are? And who do you think you're- - Go ahead. Do it! Add one more to the list. Stay back. You. Yeah, it's me. Do it! It'll be one more down. You two know each other? Is he the one you were chasing? Yes. Mmm, now what did you do? I ain't done nothing wrong. I was trying to get away from this crazy, vicious animal. Crazy dog. You wasn't there. You didn't hear it. What are you even doing here? This is your side of the street anymore. I wasn't supposed to be here tonight. Look, you startled me, and I automatically went into cop mode. That's always the excuse, isn't it? Your face has been all over the news since that shooting. I was at the protest. I organized it. You were standing right there next to the chief's son when he shot Areleus Jenkins down in cold blood. The man was just protesting. Respectfully. Peacefully. Legally. Had no weapons, posed no threat. You made quite a name for yourself out of this, hadn't you? Yeah, I know who you are. Somebody's gotta stand up for this city. Standing up for the city, but you're running from a dog? I got my limit, okay? Don't try to change the subject. I still can't believe that the DA and the mayor took your word over everybody else's. Over 300 people, a mixed crowd, mind you, say they saw an unarmed man shot down in cold blood! Now, how is it that only two people, the chief's son and you, say the exact opposite and your story's believed? You don't understand how it works! As painful as the truth may be. It will always set you free. I wanted to tell the truth. I tried, but- - You were afraid, afraid of what would happen next. That's your chief? Hm? Aren't you going answer it? Bet he's wondering where you are. Why you haven't stopped by to pick up your Purple Heart yet. After all, you are his hero. Matter of fact, give it to me. I got a few things to say to your chief. He's no longer my chief. You still took the fall for some people that wouldn't do the same thing for you? Must be a bad feeling being at the bottom again, huh? All right, that's enough outta you, Randolph. How do you know my name? You're always trying to fill that vacant spot inside of you. Isn't that right, Mac? When you first joined that force, you were on a fast trip to the top. And, ooh, that police chief, he you sure took a liking to you. Hey chief, would you like some more coffee? Felt good to be seen, especially by someone that you respected. He quickly became like the father that you always wanted. He's not the man I thought he was. People, they disappoint. They lie. When someone you hold in a high regard, turns out not to be who you thought they were, that's really something. First time I saw the chief beat his wife, he had that same look in his eye that my dad would get when he would hit my mom. Must really be something. When you realize that you're not the hero you thought you'd be, 'cause you look in the mirror and all you see is a coward looking back at you, because you didn't have the guts to stop somebody. What did you do, Eden, for all this? What I still do, I help people make decisions. What kind of decisions? Decisions that will influence the shape of things to come. Essentially, the fate of many individual lives. You're tired. You haven't had a good night sleep in months. It's this city. Nothing good can come from a city like this. I begged to differ. A long time ago, they said that nothing good would come out of Nazareth. What? This city has great promise. Well, if it's not this city, then it's the people that make up this city. 48 hours this time. They never keep me. I'm not crazy. It's probably why I never had kids of my own. I know firsthand how bad a father can screw up as kids. Ain't that the truth? Randolph, your stepfather was a very bad man too. He would tie your wrist to your ankles and he would beat you. And then he would lock you in a closet, sometimes for days. Is she right? So what, man, what about it? I'm not judging you, man. Been, knocked around more times than I care to remember. That's right, Mac. Your father, he would make you go hungry for days on end. And he would sit across the table from him and he would make you watch him as he ate his dinner and his dessert. And he would dare you to ask for something to eat. And then he would send you to your room hungry. And you would eat from people's garbage cans on your way to school. Damn. And the way he would beat your mother. She never told anybody. She was scared of what my grandfather and his brothers in blue would do. She didn't wanna leave us kids without a father. Can't imagine the kind of guilt that carries. I can. You two have more in common than you will ever know. Turn my head way too much. Looking the other way when other cops were planting drugs on innocent victims, lying on the stand. Move ahead another step in line. I got nobody to blame for myself. What about Tamir? Hey, what you doing, punk? What? Nothing? I wasn't doing anything. I was just taking this bike home. I didn't mean to do anything. Story after story, but you should have done different. You didn't do anything to stop that one neither, did you? I tried. But you didn't. I thought I told you not to come around here. I wasn't doing anything wrong. Now you see, Ms. Eden, this is why I gather crowds in the streets to protest this abuse of power. This is why I stand up, because somebody has to! I gotta wake up the people. Yes, wake up the people. Protest all the injustice. Protest, yes, you do that, but you do the right way. You do it without the violence, without the looting, without the fires, without the breaking windows. And you educate the people. You educate the people and you teach them how to educate themselves. And you make sure that they get together and they vote, and they need to know who they're voting for. And they've got to vote every time, not just for the president of the United States, but for the people in that district, they've got to know what they believe in. They've got to know where they've come from. They've got to know what they've done. Educate the people. And yes, you, you protest. But you do it the right way. So that's where your abuse of power comes from. Are you serious? So you're still not gonna take responsibility for your actions through all of this? That kid was countless other black and brown kids. What happened to him happens on a regular. Now you're gonna shoot me? Hm? Now you finally got the courage to do something? Hm? All that talk, should've done what was right, but it ain't even about them, man. It still all about you protecting yourself, your jobs, your people, you. You gonna follow through with it this time? 'Cause I sure as hell won't go down a coward like you. This isn't for you. Put it down. No, he's right, this is the best way. No, there is another way. You don't have to carry that weight around your neck for another moment, for another second. If you are really sorry, ask for forgiveness. God will forgive you. Why? Why should he? Are you sorry? Yes. I wish I had done what was right, even if it cost me everything else. You're not gonna kill yourself, Mac. How do you know? Like I told you before, I know things. Put, put that down. What do you want? Peace. I want peace. I need peace and forgiveness. Who or what do you believe in? I don't know. And what about you? I believe there is a God. I have a lot of questions concerning him, and I have a lot of questions for him, but yeah, I believe God exists. Now that peace and forgiveness that you desire, it's available, but you have to be willing to change. Answer it. Hello. Who is this? Who do you think that was? I don't know. I heard "It's still time." Like, "Now's time." "Come, it's the time." Be clear headed, be alert. Your enemy, the dark one, is like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Ms. Eden, I don't really know who you are, and I don't really know what's going on here, but I feel like things will be all right. You keep doing what you doing. You are walking in your purpose. I look forward to watching you as you grow into the leader that you are born to be. I said leave! Mac, my dearest, dearest, Mac, you are now and have always been my hero. My greatest pleasure on this earth was being your wife. This cancer in my bones will never reach the depths that your love reaches in my soul. I will see you in heaven, Mac, and just know that you always, always be my hero. You okay, man? Well, it's in your hands. I follow through with this, you realize what this means, right? I realize what it means if you don't. When we turn our heads to things that are wrong and we don't do anything to stop it, we are just as guilty, because we are allowing it to continue. Just like you were willing to lay down your gun, you are showing deep sacrifice for the greater good. Isn't that the irony? That's what I assumed I'd be doing as a cop. Be the hero, Mac. Be the hero for all of those young boys and all of those young girls that are dreaming the way you once did. This. This is your new beginning. For you to take hold of it. You, you were created to do good things. Do good. There are a lot of good cops out there. They're waiting for you to do the right thing. You, you stand up and you lead the way! Truth will set you free, right? Yes. This is full of emails and files and photographs and the dashboard cam footage from the day of the shooting. I've been meaning to do this for a long time. I just never had the guts to follow through. This is the perfect time. Take it. Do what you do, man. We can do this. Right? Right? You don't wanna do this. I'm telling you, you don't wanna do this. I was right. She's here. It's you. You're back. I am. I'm sorry, come in. It's just, I'm still so overwhelmed that you're actually here. It looks like a storm is coming. The storm is already here. How was your evening? Fruitful, Sister Anne, fruitful. I am so glad. May I get you something? Anything. You are so good to me. Serving you is an honor. That God would use me in this way. Don't, no, Sister Anne, you don't bow me. We only bow to Father God. The prophecy will be fulfilled. Yes, the prophecy will be fulfilled. Are you all ready? We have been ready for centuries. Just waiting for you. Here, I'll give you your space. Thank you. Thank you. Father God, creator and source, ancient of days, as it has always been and will be forever, I am yours. I will serve you, I will worship you only. Use me. Lucifer. Sister, I have missed you. And I missed you, brother. I wanna go back to how we once were. We can't. Why not? Lucifer, what you've done, it can't be undone. When you've tried to remove Father God you severed ties that can never be repaired. Your selfishness, your pride, your, your greed for power, it destroyed our sacred relationship. You did this. Yes, brother, you did- - I know! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know that you are. Please. My one regret, my one regret, it that I lost you. There's gotta be something I can do. I've gained the world but I have nothing without you. Please, my life is miserable without you. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry too. Give another chance. Gimme another chance to prove myself. Let me in. I can't come in unless you allow me. I'll do anything. Tell me what to do! There's nothing that you can do. And there's nothing, nothing that I can do. No! No! No! No! Eden! Breaking news. We have live coverage as protestors take to the streets. New video evidence comes forward about the Areleus Jenkins police shooting. Dash cam footage, as well as a series of incriminating emails, has surfaced showing widespread corruption of the police force to the very top.
