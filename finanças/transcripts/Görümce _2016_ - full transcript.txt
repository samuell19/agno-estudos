Ahmet? Ahmet? Ahmet? You're talking to me? What are you saying? I can't hear you. Pears? Sure, I'll prepare some. Ahmet! I said "Did Ahmet wake up?" Why can't you hear me, you idiot! Now I understand you... Don't make me open my foul-mouth... See, I did already. Wait! Where is Ahmet? -I don't know. He got up early and left. -It's our Sunday breakfast time! Ahmet! I hate to spoil the lady's yoga ritual, but would she open her door to a lonely man who ran away from home? Ahmet! I'm yours for the day, my sultan. -Breakfast? -What brings you here on a Sunday? -Fine, so I'll go. -Wait, don't be silly. Come. Don't insist. I'm not coming. Really, don't insist. I'm leaving. I'll tear my hair out! Fatoş, do these colors go together? This one goes with the color of diet bread! Go and change it! -The person you have called-- -He doesn't answer. I know him. That's how he is. He sees and hears it, but he won't answer. I'll call you ten times! You'll see! You still didn't tell her, did you? I will, but I'm on the lookout for an opportunity. Right. You'll say, "We can't do it like this." Right? -Am I not right? -You're right. You're right. I'll talk to her as soon as possible, alright? But now, we'll enjoy today. Give me a cheek. It's from work. You pour the tea, dear. You just couldn't get the job done! You called me so many times. What is it, Onur? What is it again? She'll find out! Everything is in place. Don't worry, it's all good. So why are you calling? Are you hitting on me? I called to say don't worry. The theater is all ours. -The owner is okay. I got the confetti. -OK, don't overdo it. Look, when Deniz's friends call, make sure they get the address right. Don't be silly. I'm not coming. You'll have to deal with this yourself. I trust you. How can I find someone else at the last minute? And even if I did would she say yes? Onur, stop being silly. It's alright, we're coming soon. Hang up. OK. Well, so, you can count the tiles, then. I don't have to come. -Let's go. -Where to? -To the film theater! -So early? You can watch movies anytime. In Korea, they have screenings at six am. In Korea? -Right. -What are you talking about? It's not nonsense. Come here. -Are you serious? -Yes, I am. Come on, man... Sorry. Give me a break, man! I can't do it when you wait for me! You can't say goodbye to all you have eaten. I'll go get the tickets for the girls. It's clear you won't get this shit done. Hey! Altan. Make sure the tickets are on the same row. What is on the same row? Where is he? Who is he with? What's he saying? Wait a minute, Fatoş. I can't hear him. He's losing the signal. -I have no signal. Hello? -Onur, where are you? At Moi, theater nine. The film is almost over. Ahmet is about to-- Hello? Come on, hurry! Don't be late, come on! He hung up. What did he say? -He said something about same row! -OK. "I'm in panic. Ahmet is about to..." he said. What does that mean? He is about to kill himself! Oh, Ahmet! Oh, Ahmet! Oh, Ahmet! The film in theater number four is starting. -Is it here? -We'll find it dear. Come here. Sorry. Yes. -I forgot to get popcorn. -Never mind. The film is starting. There's still some time. -We can get it later. -No, I'm coming now. Some people are unique. You can't see them anywhere else. You can't even imagine how life would be without the other. That's exactly how I feel. Every morning I wake up without you is like wine without grapes, rice pudding without rice, always missing the other half. -Onur! -Is she watching? Did she get it? -She didn't get it. -She didn't? No. It's all going right. Let me go! Come on! -You can't go in. I have to search you. -I'll talk to your superiors! What's their number? Breaker 1-9! Mayday! Mayday! -Ma'am, I have to search you! -OK! -Ma'am, what are you doing? -Get away! Let's get this done. -What's this? Who is she? -What do you mean? He's going to commit suicide! Don't you get it? Suicide? What suicide? What suicide? Where? Without you, I feel incomplete. Let's put our arms around each other and be together, for the rest of our lives. It's almost over. Man, I'm warning you, don't get too carried away. -Maybe she won't say yes... -I watched every video online. Even I would say yes to some of them! -But she plays hard and says no. -It's shocking, sure. -I'm not going to risk that, man. -Well, I won't either. The ring. Where is the ring? You had it. What ring? I'm kidding! My precious! -Sorry. -Popcorn. Come on, hurry up! -Come on, run! -Suicide! -Where? Where is the theater? Where is the theater? Upstairs! Get away! Where? I know you don't like this kind of thing. And I'm aware that I'm taking a risk. I know that. But I still wanted to take my chance. What do you say? Surprise! I don't believe this! Ahmet? -Behind you. -Look behind you! Behind you! A lifetime of seeing me with swelling eyes every morning having to laugh at my bad jokes and finding my socks in the most unlikely places around the house would you like to live such a life with me? You're silly. You know that? I know. But won't you say something? Ahmet! Sister? -Say yes! -Sir, wait! Don't do it! Ahmet, what's going on? Sir, what are you doing? -What are you doing? -He'll kill himself! -Are you alright? -Ahmet! My brother! How can he do this? He was so young! He did it! He did it! How did he do it? In the theater, he went down on his knees. Like in the movies! And everyone applauded him, without shame! No way! How can they applaud a dead man? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? What dead man? Didn't he commit suicide? No! He proposed to her! It's worse than death! My brother! How could he do that? Sister? Welcome, Ahmet. Ahmet, I was so-- Where you've been? Put her down, wash your hands and let's eat something. Won't you ask me something? Are you hungry? Sister! Wait, I'll tell you something. Sonay bought a blouse. It was ten sizes too small for her. -Why buy this? -You saw it all. She said-- Saw what? The thing today? Yes, I saw that, but it was just a fake proposal. Are you trying to get in her pants? -You pig! -Mind your words! You know what, she is too short. So that so that, I could barely see her. She's squint. I saw that much. You know what I did today? I went shopping. It was so hot! My hair was messed up. -We're getting married! -Should I get my hair trimmed? -We're getting married! -Maybe I should use this caviar serum. -We're getting married! -OK, no rush. We'll talk about that later. -We'll talk about it now. Come here. -No. -Let's... -Sit down. I fell in love for the first time. Look me in the eye. You'll like Deniz when you get to know her. Sister. You will support me, right? As always, right? Look this time-- You know what I mean. Take it. What a bigmouth! He loves her, he'll get married. I won't let him! What about me? Will I grow old and wither away all alone? I won't wither away! I'm crying so hard, I'm getting wrinkles. Will I wither away and die in wrinkles? He's so sweet. You know, the suicide thing aside, he put out a real show. So well done. Even I was shaking in excitement. We do all the work and he gets the girl, and all the praise! That's not fair! Nebo, admit it, even you got emotional. I could feel your energy. No way. Let's say it was more like a shock. It took just a movie ticket to persuade a woman who said she'd never get married! Here comes the groom! Wasn't the beating supposed to be after the wedding? That's so funny! I first thought that was part of the plan. -I didn't get that. -That's the intense energy! Everyone was drawn into it. Didn't you feel the energy? I felt it so intense! Where's your sister? You should have invited her. She got very excited when she saw the surprise. -She's weeping for joy. -What do you mean? Didn't she know? If she did, we wouldn't be here. You're exaggerating. I can get along with everyone. You know that. I can get along with her, too. My name is Yeliz! Do you think I'll give my beloved brother away -to that ugly girl? -You won't! -Didn't I scare his ex-girlfriends away? -You did! -And I broke them apart? -You did. What's my nickname? -Fixer! -Slut! Sonay, what did you say? I said, Fixer! Sure you did. Alright... Fatoş, wait a minute. Where is the lace of this teapot? -Will it taste different with the lace? -Don't answer me back or I'll fire you! Right, where were we? We're cutting the fat, short, squint, loser girl down to size. I'm running out of patience! Why are you picking on him? He's young. Of course he'll get married. He'll get married, have kids, have a wife, a family. What do you care? He is not getting married! Shithead! I'm not giving my brother away to some girl! -Your Sivas blood has come out. -Fatoş, bring me pen and paper. I'll make a plan for that ugly girl. What are we meeting for? -Hasret, I'm sure you know. -How am I to know? Congratulations, by the way. I heard you said yes! Right, I did something crazy. Come here, let me take a look. He even arranged a movie theater, right? Never mind. Not everyone has to propose in a creative way. So that's how he did it. I want a ring on my finger like that too. I need one too. Find me a Turkish girl. Francesco, Turkish girls aren't what they seem. You don't understand. I admire Turkish girls. He admires them because he has no idea. Once you get to know them, it's all over. -Shame on you! -The boss is coming. She seems very nervous. Guys, we'll have a new contest. Our aim is to create a strong, reliable, leading brand. Deniz, the ugly bitch flirting with my brother behind my back for a year and a half. Squint, vertically challenged. She's our target this time. The rivalry is tough. We must be different. With Ahmet's ex-lovers, we've been victorious. This time, we'll be more creative, more impressive, and even more cruel. This bitch is planning to get married with my brother. This time, the enemy is strong. Our deadline is 30 days away. First of all... We'll arrange a dinner for three. Mark my words, my name is Yeliz and I'm going to break them apart! The war has just begun! Ahmet, why are you so nervous? Maybe you should wear a bullet-proof vest. You're exaggerating. Women understand each other. We'll get along. I know. Yes, yes. And older sisters are sweet, nice, warm. I've always wished I had one. Yes, yes. Is that your sister? Yes, yes. -Hello. -Hello. My one and only! Look, how handsome he is. Sister, Deniz. Ah, I'll have to bend down a bit. -What's your perfume? -I don't use perfume. -This is natural soap. -I think you should. Sorry. Yes, ma'am? No, please, go on. We were going to a family dinner. It's fine. I'm listening. I'm coming. Yes, I'm listening. I prepared them. Sure, I'll add those too. So I'll get them ready tomorrow. Alright. Thanks a lot. Good night. Sister! You got your seat? I insisted! She feels sick at the back, dear. OK. A short person must have sat here. My legs are long. I can barely fit here. -Are you comfortable there? -Yes, yes. Is it close? Yes, we're almost there. She is vertically challenged. This table is free. -Oh no! -What? What happened? Is something wrong? I got too much attention again. May the evil eye look away. Let me pinch my bottom. I've pulled out the chair for her since she was a child. Sister! -Filiz, how are you? -Deniz. What shall we eat? Well, I don't know if we can trust the kitchen here, Ahmet. This is Deniz's friend's place. Oh dear. Don't worry. I'll take you to a much nicer place next time. Welcome. -Ah, Nebo. -Hello. My friend. The owner. -Nebo. -Hello. Did she say Nebo? Just the kind of name that goes with the place. I knew it would be something like that. -Şule. My friend from the agency. -Hello. This is Fazıl. He came from London. Come on, skinny, ask me. You're going to say "How can you be older than him, you look younger." Right? -Sorry? -It's genetics, baby. Some have the genes, some don't. Nebo. -Yes. -We're hungry. What shall we eat? We have great organic chicken soup. I can also get you a rustic salad. -Great. -Here's what I want. I'll eat tarhana soup, and some rice. With a wooden spoon! Why don't you choose the starters? What are you doing? -What? Nothing. -Look, I warned you. Be kind to Deniz. I am. Don't blame me for nothing. Fine, she's a sweet girl. -Yes, she is. -But she's squint. -Sister! -OK, I didn't say anything. This is for your own good. She's good. -OK. -But she's squint. She looks like that. If it weren't for you, I'd smack her in the mouth. You can't see her mouth with all that make-up. That's enough! Don't put me in a tight spot. She thinks she's making fun of me. "Give me tarhana soup and rice!" she says. -You should just give her some chili. -Right! Honey, come over here. I missed you. So, Deniz is a successful copywriter at an advertising agency. Yes, we work very-- It is getting cold, did you notice? Good thing I put this on. -Are you cold? Do you want a shawl? -No. There! Oh, I missed it. I hate flies. Too many flies here. Let us tell you the story of how we met. It's romantic. Now, we went to Spain on a business trip-- I killed it this time! It couldn't get away. If something upsets me, I just crush it like that. -You spilled it. -Sorry. -Who is it, honey? -İsmet. We have a new client, and she's bothering me about the project. -Did you tell her? -I couldn't tell her, Ahmet. İsmet is my boss at the agency. She's a peculiar person. -No. -What is it, Ahmet? -Nothing. -She believes work and marriage don't really work together. So if she hears you're getting married, will she fire you? Definitely. I mean, probably. No, no way. You know what my sister does? -She... -What does she do? Anyway, the food is here. -Here you are. -Thank you. The soup may be a bit hot. I hope you like chili pepper. I love it. I'm from Sivas! -Bring on the hot stuff! -Really? Deniz, if it's too much for you, I'll eat it. Did you like it? -Does it taste good? -Very good. Sister? -Are you OK? -Blow in my mouth! Blow! Blow in my mouth! God, I'm burning! Where is the bathroom? Help! I'm burning! God! Where is the bathroom? Where is the bathroom? Ahmet, I'm burning! Ahmet, this is not water! -No! -Don't drink more! Toilet! Ahmet! I'm burning! I'm burning! God! I'm burning! God, I'm burning! Ahmet, don't do that. Stay at your own house, in comfort. What would people say anyway? We'll get married. So I don't care who says what. What do you mean you'll get married? I mean, I'm thinking of Filiz-- Deniz. I'm thinking of her. Don't let people call her a bad girl. Sister. Alright. Honey, please. My brother! My brother! Ahmet! -My dear wife... -We aren't husband and wife yet, sir. -We're not married yet. -Oh, you're complaining. You're a wife already. Don't make me throw this ring on your head! I've always wanted to say that. So, since we're fighting like an old couple we can get to the next level. Next level? Could you be more clear about that? Sure, I can. Ah, it's coming. -What's coming? -A call. From my sister. -How do you know it's your sister? -I feel it. Look. Yes, dear. -Did you get your keys? -What? Don't get locked out. I told you that I was staying with Deniz tonight. She sends her greetings. Right. Right. -What happened? -My sister loves you. "What a pretty girl!" she says. She's crazy about you. Crazy. My brother! Don't go, I need you You're the light in my eye You're my precious, I need you Kill me before you go I'm a sister! My brother! I won't let you go! You're my brother! Yes, sister? Ahmet, honey, I thought you might be worried about me. Right, we were just about to lay bare the question "How is my sister doing?" Honey, why did you-- Lay bare? Honey! I was just looking at the old photos. I saw a photo of you at your circumcision feast. You look so afraid. Like I always say, we should never nip the youth in the bud, right? I'm kidding, honey. You're holding my hand so tight. I'll hold something else if you just left me alone. Kisses. -Is that her? Isn't she asleep? Hello? -Deniz sends her kisses. "Kisses!" Did she tell that to me? Disgusting! Blockhead! Who are you to call me idiot? Didn't you call me idiot? Who are you to say "Kisses." to me? -Right, OK. -Look at her voice. You jerk! How dare you say "Kisses!" To me! You scumbag! Who do you think you are? Right, OK. My sister loves you. "What a pretty girl!" she says. She's crazy about you. Crazy. Idiot! How dare you talk to me? Did I say hello to you? You jerk! I'm out of breath. What were we saying? I think we weren't talking. So what were we doing? Ahmet! -What is it? -I don't know. -What are you doing? -Is that gum? -Is it? Wait. You're hurting me. -It's stuck! -Wait. -It's hurting! -It's stuck. -Ahmet! You stepped on my foot. Do you have scissors? -Scissors? -Scissors. Their target market is women. We have to come up with something never said before. Something new. Never mind work now. Tell me about your sister-in-law. What is it with you? You love gossip! Right, let's have a gossip. I mean, she's a little strange. A resentful soul. I'll tell you what. Maybe she has lost her light in her former life. Look, who's coming! Come here. Ah, darling! What a beautiful dress! Turn around, let's see it. Turn around. It's beautiful. You're a princess now? Yes. -What will you be when you grow up? -I'll get married. What else? What work will you do? I'll make a baby and I'll cook. -Look at that! -Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Let me see. You look dirty. That's no way to be a princess. She's a child. Let her get dirty. What do you mean? She isn't a street child! Everyone will condemn you. They'll call you dirty girl. Come on. -Goodbye, princess. -Come on, my princess. Goodbye, princess. Şule! I got it! PRINCESS Princess? -We know our enemy now. -Is she pretty? -Ugly. -How was she dressed? A disaster. A lousy, green blouse. -Nile green? -No. -Khaki green? -Not that either. -Water green? -No! Just green. Normal green. She works as a writer for some advertisement place. How do they find time to work? Sonay, stay on the subject! Look, last night at dinner, she gave me a hint she never should have. What hint? She said that if her boss heard she was getting married, she would fire her! So, what will I do? I'll go to her work tomorrow and shout around that she's getting married. And then what? -Her boss will fire her. -Hello, Ahmet? And they'll fight and break up. Watch out! -Hello. -Hi. There's a big-mouthed, squint vertically challenged girl working here. -Sorry? -Deniz. -Deniz? -Yes, her. -I'll let her know. Please, wait here. -Right. Deniz is getting married, by the way! Deniz is getting married! Deniz is getting married! Watch out! Deniz is getting married! We should get approval on this. Please, don't mind me. I'm looking for a friend. -Yeliz! -Deniz! What happened to your hair? You shortened it. It was longer last night. Deniz, who is the lady? What's that? You folks drink your coffee in this? Carton! So ugly. You've got to have better taste. And what is this? That's a box we designed for a website, for our female customers. I say that's just a trash box! Presentation matters, ladies and gents! It should be a box you don't want to toss out. You should keep using it. And the brand will be there all the time. See, there. You... What was your name? Francesco Bellini. You're welcome. Can I have that box, Francesco? Thank you. But that t-shirt won't fit in that! Hold it, please. Of course it won't, if it's you who folds it! Yes. You, curly! Toss me that thing on your neck. Give me that. Something is missing. Ah, wait! I'm affected by the evil eye every day, you know. There! That's it. Don't stare! Here, this is customer insight! -Who are you? -I'm the consumer customer ins-- No. I'm Deniz's sister-in-law. -No, she's not! -Ahmet? -Ahmet? -No sister-in-law. Sister! Here comes the groom! -They're getting married. -No, no marriage. There's been a misunderstanding. Come on. No, let me go, honey! Don't I deserve to share my happiness? I'm her sister-in-law! -Ahmet, what's going on? -I'm asking you the same! We're having a wedding this summer. Everyone is invited. We have a wedding this summer. They're really getting married! I'm so happy, as a sister! No! No marr-- I mean, it's a joke. It was just a bet between friends. -A bet? -No! He proposed to marry her. -Please! -What is he saying? You know what he says to her? "My love, my darling." He proposed to her. I saw it with my own eyes. He said "Would you spend your life with me?" And she said "Yes!" She never believes me, but she believes this! -Come on. -Wait a minute. -Are you getting married? -Yes! No! -Yes! No? -No! -Yes! I mean, no! -No? -Why would I... She's squint anyway. Come on. Wait a minute. My bag. So they gave up, then. I was really excited. In this day and age, we consume things and throw them away so fast. Unfortunately. Come with me, dear. My God, what did I say! You did well by giving up the marriage, Ahmet. Of course I didn't! But I won't let you interfere in my life anymore! OK? How dare you say "I've had enough of Deniz!" Shameless! You rascal! Horny Deniz Call me, Ahmet! You're so shameless! Don't answer it! I told you. It was clear that he was a hit-and-run type. Don't be silly. Wait! Deniz, your energy is getting too high. Go and wash your face. I don't get it! How did he do something so stupid? He wasn't like that. -He became so unbalanced. -Deniz? You must have understood how wrong it is to let go of your career for a man. İsmet, I'm not too enthusiastic about getting married. But I believe that if a woman wants to, she can do well at both. I've never seen anyone who managed that. Even if you do well, your husband won't let you. -Anyway-- -Right, right. We're not going to argue this all day, are we? Everyone, get to work. İsmet... Ahmet did something stupid today, but it's not him. -When you know him, you'll understand. -All of them are the same. Look, what he did under pressure. Who am I telling that to? I brought you the best of fortune-tellers. -Where do I sit, dear? -Here. Thank you. I'm not used to daylight. Get me somewhere in the shade. -Of course. -Hello. -Welcome. Which one of you? This one. So I'll sit over here. Of course. You might be surprised at first sight that I haven't picked a profession in which I can use my physical advantages. I have preferred a job in which I can make use of my intuition, rather than my body. I deal with astrology. So my time is of the essence. Now... ...would you like me to tell the truth, or tell you fairytales that will make you happy? Tell the truth, of course. Thanks, dear. Give me your hand. Turn it over. Give me the little one. Yes. Year of birth? 1970? 1981. No, 1970. 1979! You have an insecure personality. You are introverted, but you also want to look flamboyant on the outside. Your hips are too wide, but your forehead is small. Next to an extraordinary woman like me, you're a sore loser! Your north and south psychic angles are entangled. Your karma is falling through the floor. You have deceived everyone you have met in your life, dear. She really got that right! What are you saying? Your fortune is blocked hopelessly, dear. All the planets step back when they see you. You're being dragged into a black hole. You're bothering your brother, trying to hinder his happiness. -No way! He's my brother. -You will not succeed. You will go crazy of anger. Your screams will be heard all over. But these screams will not be the sounds of joy made by a woman at the climax but rather, tormented screams of reproach. -But I-- -All sorts of people will hit you. Again, these hits will not be related to pleasure, but rather, painful ones. -God damn you! -You too, dear. Darling? -I'm coming in. -Don't. I came in. Go away, Ahmet. I won't listen to you. I'm still angry. Honey. Look, my love... You embarrassed me in front of my co-workers! "We're not getting married! It was a bet!" Are you a child? It's my sister who is a child! You deserved it! -Go away, I'm not listening. -I'll tell you everything. Look, my sister is crazy. She's too protective with me. When she heard we were getting married she went crazy. You said to her, "If the boss hears we're getting married she may fire me." And she tried to use that to her advantage. I don't understand, Ahmet. I'm trying to save our marr-- You do that by saying "It was a bet. That's why I proposed her." in front of my co-workers? I did it to stop my sister! Please, understand me. Stop your sister? If you think like this about her, who knows what you'll think about me! My sister is crazy! I told you. She did it before too. She said "Gülse had Ebola." and they quarantined her! -That beautiful girl went through so much. -Beautiful girl, is that so? Go, marry Gülse then! No, we just can't get along. No, I... Deniz. I can't live without you. You're right, I'm a fool. I messed it all up. But my darling will forgive me. Won't she? Ahmet. I'll ask you something. Am I squint? No. Who's calling so late? -Hello? -Baby, you want me to put out your fire? I've put out many fires with my firehose! Sorry? -What's going on? -I love your voice. You're burning hot! Hello? So we talk the details with you, bro? We need two hours. You got a car? -Yes! -Ahmet! -Give me the address! -Wait! Ahmet, dear! What happened? Nothing. Are you hungry? Girls, our plot to chase the squint away may have been ruined by my dear brother Ahmet. But are we giving up? -No! -Maybe. Sonay, if you're tired, you can leave! Let's say "Ahmet is a pansy!" This girl won't leave Ahmet. We have to get Ahmet to leave her. What is the weak spot of us women? -What? -Beauty! How will that work? Who is Ahmet's prettiest ex? -İrem. -Gülse. No! Aslı, from high school. When this girl sees Aslı, she'll get depressed. When she gets depressed, she'll start bickering on Ahmet. When she starts bickering, Ahmet will get angry at her. When he gets angry, they'll fight and break up! Hello again, sullen face. Wait a moment. How will I do it? Yes, Ahmet? Where are you? I'm at the spa, getting a massage. What is it? Right. I was wondering if you were going after Deniz. You're blaming me for nothing. Why would I be going after Deniz? I wonder why. OK, I'm working, I need to go. Kisses, dear. What are you looking at? Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sorry, I didn't see you. How are you, pretty and smart woman? That's very kind of you. Right. Can I have my hand back? -Sorry. -I need it sometimes. I came to pick Deniz up. Deniz is working. There's some chocolate on your lip. With your permission. Ah, no! Bitter chocolate. I like it a lot but it's bitter. You speak such great Turkish. If I didn't know you were Italian I could've mistaken you for a Turk. Thank you. Acker cacker, soda bracker, cacker acker boo. -You got it? -No. I scream, you scream, that's all we eat, ice cream. Let me go and tell Deniz, OK? You can wait in my room if you like. Here. I hope it's alright. Please. -OK. -I'll be right back. Please tell her; "Deniz, your sister-in-law is calling you for some gossip over lunch." OK. I'm not Horny Deniz! Where did you get that? I'm going crazy! You've called so many times! Enough! -What's happening? Who is that? -Some maniac. Such idiots! Deniz, your sister-in-law is calling you for gossip. What? Gossip. She says let's eat some gossip and have lunch. Something like that. -You mean Yeliz is here? -Yes, Yeliz. I'll go and check her out. She's not there. I put her in my own room. Just in case she gets bored. -Francesco, what did you do, man? -What? I came there just because I missed you. I got caught off-guard. And Ahmet said "I'm not going to marry her." just to protect you. It's fine, I know you. Ahmet is a bit anxious these days. Call me by my name. We'll be family soon. -Look, there they are. -They are here. Hello, girls. This is our girl, Deniz. -Hello. -God bless you. May God bless you. Amen. -Sit down, Deniz. -Come over here. Let's have a chat, get to know each other. You've got some wrinkles on your face. You should start stem cell treatment. Get some lifting done for your gill. -Lifting? -And for your buttocks I definitely recommend mesotherapy. I never heard of that. Your skin color makes you look ill. Pale. -Did you get a boob job? -Sorry? Did you get the tits inflated? They're saggy. Poor you. Girls, don't humiliate my dear Deniz! Maybe she doesn't want to get attention. -Exactly. I like to be natural. -I've got blusher. Put some on. No, I don't use it. Thank you. Deniz, I got a message. From Aslı, one of Ahmet's lovers. I mean, ex-lovers. She says she absolutely wants to see me today. I'll call her. It's fine with you, right? -It's fine. -But she's very beautiful. -It's fine. -OK. She's coming. Wow! Yeliz! Aslı! Welcome. -Hi. -What happened to you? I went to your doctor. You always said "Your lips are too thin." you know? I wanted them fattened up a bit but I got an allergy. It's horrible. I can't go out. But when you said "It's very important." I had to come, of course. Let's sit down and I'll tell you everything. No, don't sit down, Aslı! Who's that? I don't know her. It's my aunt! We're talking about dividing up the family land. It's a very delicate matter. -Let me say hi to-- -No, really, don't sit down. -Let me say hi! -Go away! Go away, Frankenstein! Just go away! I'll see you later! I fear my sister may do something stupid. It's going to be alright, man. Yes, I want the beam reports too. Don't worry, Let the women deal with it. You don't understand. She is out of control. She has her mind set on this. So, what will you do? It's actually, what we will do? We? Follow my sister. And let me know if anything happens. Understood. OK. Detectives Onur and Altan. We'll follow her around like her shadow. She won't notice a thing. -Is it you? -Who else? Mind your words, or I'll fire you! Fire me! Please! Like you can find someone else! Why are you sitting here doing nothing? Sonay will bring a cooler. We have a fridge already. Why-- Did you break the fridge? God knows what she did to break it! -It's working. -Am I supposed to open the door? I'm busy. -Did you bring it? -Yes. Is this the amulet that makes them grow cold of each other? It makes them grow so cold! I got a piece of blessed plaster for my back. -It will work, right? -It worked great for Hacer's backaches. Ah, you're asking about the other thing. Of course it will work. -It will break them up. Certainly. -Let's go and put it under her bed. You're getting into talismans now? You'll get paralyzed, like that! Don't do stupid things with your face! Shut up, will you! -Have you got her key? -No. How shall we put it there? -Let's get ourselves invited. -You're her sister-in-law after all. Yes, I am. Why am I supposed to be her sister-in-law? No, I'm not! No, I-- I'm her sister-in-law today. I won't be tomorrow. Is it well hidden? The enemy is in the vicinity of Deniz's house. There are four of them. Unarmed, but they have high heels! -I'm coming. -OK. Come on. Run! Do you have that Amazon tea that Fazıl brought? -Yes. -I'm never drinking that. A friend says he talked to the chair for an hour after drinking it! -No, thanks. -It's completely natural. You need to use just a pinch of it. I don't want it. By the way, Yeliz and I, our style is so different. -All she wants is to be beautiful. -Exactly. Şule. Have you ever heard of something called mesotherapy? -Mesrotherapy? -Meso. She says I need mesotherapy. -She's calling. -Who? My sister-in-law. You made me say that word! I'm not answering. Come on! Answer it. -Şule! -Answer it! We'll have some fun. -Hello, Yeliz. -Are you at home? -Yes. -I thought I'd stop by. We're at the door. At the door? -Yes. -I'll open it. I'm not sure if this is your building. Because it's a small apartment. They opened the door. We're here. Ah, there you are. How are you? I remember her. The spiritual one who opened the door too. So, girls... Welcome. We weren't expecting you. It's a surprise. -You have such a unique house. -Thank you. You don't have nesting tables? -No, I don't. -What's that? No nesting tables! I don't believe it! Where do you display your crystals? I don't have any. How so? And no nesting tables either? Do you happen to have a bathroom? Yes I do. It's over there. Anyway, I'll have some tea. Tea, OK. -Me too, dear. -Of course. Hello, Deniz. Where is the kitchen? Let me help you with the tea. God bless you. You're so beautiful. Thank you very much. You're as beautiful as Ahmet says. -I'm Fatoş. -In fact I almost know you. Ahmet tells me about you. He says "You should taste Fatoş's great dishes." My dear. I love Ahmet so much. He pretty much grew up in my hands. He's a wonderful boy. I hope everything goes right for you. Ignore these women. No, she and I, we're just a little different. A little? You're very different. Doesn't your hair get worms? Of course it does. Would you like a fleshy one? -Disgusting! -Nebo! So, ladies, what do you do? -Do you produce anything at all? -What am I supposed to produce? I don't know, like, plant flowers, paint, or listen to music, whatever. Any such things? We buy those things ready-made. Right, İnci? OK. Not even a dresser! Ugly girl! God! It's an earthquake! It was so long. God damn you! It must be so hard to do it on this! God, forgive me. I'll smack her in the mouth! You go in, don't leave them alone. I'll brew the tea. -Nebo! -Don't get me angry. Nebo? Şule? -What's going on? -Nebo, please! This queer will beat me up! She called me a female bear! She... I'll ruin her! Is this the tea? OK, since you have all poured out your hearts, can we calm down? Bastards! Yeliz! Yeliz! Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm very fine. I just lost my earring. And I hate losing my earring. My blood pressure goes down when I lose it. -And when it goes down to-- -Your earring is on your ear! Oh, it really is. That was easy. Come on, tea is ready. Let me pour some more tea. Some more. May God be on our side. My daughter! Mom! Dad! -Hello, dear. -I don't believe it! It's you! Look who is with us! My brother! Ahmet! We entrust him to you. Take good care of him. Come on, go to your sister. My dear Ahmet! Mom! Dad! Don't leave us alone! Please! My brother, don't you worry! I'll never leave you alone! My one and only! -My one and only! -Sister? What are you doing! Sister! Did you drink something cold again? Why is your voice like that? My dear, is that you? Sister, what are you doing? Don't be silly. Wait a moment! What are you doing? -Ahmet! -Sister? Ahmet? What are you doing? Are you hungry? No. All our plans have failed. Let's talk about what to wear at the wedding. I'll wear something sexy, with a bit of cleavage with padded shoulders and fringes. I'll wear a mid-calf dress. With a deep back cleavage! You're idiots. You know that, right? There's not going to be a wedding! But we ran out of plans. Yes, Yeliz. Just let them get married. We'll get them to divorce. "Get them to divorce." It wasn't me dancing with those bohemian girls! Stay focused. This isn't over yet. Doesn't this girl have parents? How do they let her marry so easily? Right, we didn't even ask for her hand. Really, why didn't we? Let's do it. Are you crazy? If you ask for her hand, they'll get married. And it's all over. Depends on who is asking, baby. Who's asking? Yılmaz. My alcoholic uncle! The one who kept asking why no belly dancer came out of the cake! And then he rolled over into the cake while he was looking for her. Uncle Yılmaz? The one who did that thing with the credit card at the wedding? No way! OK. -We're not doing this! End of story! -Call them, ask them if you're close. Which if they were, we could tell by the smell. He always smells alcohol. How did you come up with Uncle Yılmaz? Am I supposed to ask for her hand? The family elder should do it. He may be a drunk, but he's your uncle. An uncle is good as a mother, right? -Which Uncle Yılmaz? -How many do we have? -It's Yılmaz the drunk! -The drunk... See, he got the smell already. No way! We're not asking for her hand. I didn't ask for it anyway! You heard me? We're definitely not doing this! I'm calling Deniz. End of story. Cancelled. Ahmet! -Uncle? -Ahmet. We're not late, are we? Yeliz, my dear baby! We're just in time. Thank God. Welcome. Unnecessarily well, in fact. Your uncle quit drinking. He quit it totally. I quit it. I won't drink one drop of alcohol from now on. Congratulations. You found just the day to quit! -My God! -Well done, Uncle. -Let me kiss your hand. -My dear. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go and get the girl, right? Of course. Let's go. Isn't that Fatoş? She hasn't changed at all. Uncle, you may get anxious out there. Have a sip of this! I quit, dear! Yeliz, don't do that! -No, your uncle quit, Yeliz! -I don't even go near a cologne bottle! Fine, but this is just once! -Just a sip! -Don't shove it in my mouth! -He quit it completely! -Well done! -Just a sip! Just a bit! Come on! -No! Get off him! Get away! The man quit drinking! Please. -Let me go! -Let him go! Ahmet! Deniz, I'm so anxious. It's like they're asking for my hand. We finally got to meet you, Yeliz. Yeliz? We have already met Ahmet, of course. When they decided on this, that made us happy, of course. Even though it was a bit early. Early? Oh, please. I know my brother well. He would never miss such a beautiful, natural girl! God, look how natural she is! Ahmet! Look at her. Look how elegant, how natural she is! Me, I've got plastic surgery all over me. No, you're beautiful too. Deniz got her beauty genes from me! And her intelligence from me! -Her father is a bit egotistic! -And ours is a quitter! And ours always has an answer! Deniz, here's a word of motherly advice for you. Don't waste your career just for a man. You'll become dependent on others. So we're others now? Don't say that, my little peanut! That's not a nice thing to say, my little hazelnut! Look at me! Look at him! See how sweet he is? Look how cute he is! Let me... ...kiss you! Give me a kiss! Ahmet! This is incredible! This is just incredible, Ahmet! You smell exactly the same as your father-in-law! When he was a boy, he used to steal all the soap in the house! And he went to the bathroom-- -Come on, Uncle! -What are you doing! -No, I won't drink! I quit! -Uncle! He would go into the bathroom and soap himself for hours-- Yeliz, wait a moment! Rubbing himself-- If you give your blessings, we ask for your daughter Deniz's hand for our son Ahmet! Dad? So, she's yours! We're so happy! Come here, my beautiful bride! She's so sweet! Wait. It got tangled up. -Hello? -Yeliz, did you ask for the girl's hand? What girl? Deniz, of course. Your photos together are all over the place! Everyone is talking about you on Facebook! Hang up, just a moment! Together how? No way! No! No! I can't have done this! No! -No! -Get ready! Wait a moment. From the bride's sister-in-law! It's a family heirloom! So expensive! My ring! -You really didn't have to. -You deserve it. This ring is an heirloom from my grandmother. Don't be sad. It was old anyway! Shut up! How come I put that ring on that bitch! Alcohol is bad for you. Why did you drink so much? You just lost the ball-sized diamond! You'll leave and I'll have to deal with her! Bless you! Thank you. We have to get this ring back! -A message. -You'll steal it? I bet she'll even think of cutting her finger off! Yes, I'm thinking. -See, I can cut it, crackling like that. -Hello? What? Who is this? Hi, Yeliz. We have a happy hour at the agency today. It would be great to see you. Francesco. -Isn't that the... -The foreigner. Not foreigner, he is Italian. -There you go. -You know what? You said yes when he proposed. That's OK. They asked for your hand. That's OK too. But the ring? You are so keen on marriage. I decided to get married, but what can I say for the ring? If you don't want it, don't wear it. -Don't wear it! -But it's got a lovely energy! -"It's got a lovely energy!" -I have to. It's a family heirloom. What if she doesn't see it on my finger? There she comes. Just when you need her. -Deniz. -It's a miracle! I saw you, and I was dying to see you. God, no need to die. Look, how my heart beats when I see you. -How? -Knock knock. Can I have my hand back? Yeliz, welcome. -The ring! -Ring? What ring? Ringing! I had to keep ringing the bell over there, when I came in. We have a Happy Hour her every Friday. -I'll be back soon. -Deniz, wait a moment. There's something on your lip. Right, it's fine now. İsmet. -İsmet. -Yes, Deniz? Say it quick. I forgot my phone. Can someone bring it? Right away. It's about the contest. -The campaign is ready, but... -So what is it? I have another idea. Like a social campaign. Deniz, we're not a charity. We already have a campaign. -I'd focus on it, if I were you. -Here. If you can, of course. After all, you're very confused these days. Your sister-in-law is always around you. But, İsmet... You know, you look so funny. Wipe your face. Speaking of awareness... Isn't that too much? Yes, it is too much! -That's too much. -Yes, this was too much for me. And your hands are so smooth, by the way. Yes... My hand? Oh, no. Deniz! This cream is too much for me. Would you like some? Give me your hand! Wait! The ring will come off. It's old-fashioned anyway. I'll get you a new one. But I'm looking after it so well. Why is that, dear? But I'll keep it on my finger forever. Because it's your present to me. But I need to go to the toilet. There's something on my face. Your hands are always so soft. -Thank you. Alright, tomorrow at noon. Shall we sweat again, like last time? Some positions were a bit hard for you. I hope you don't quit early this time! See you. This bitch is out to meet her lover! I'm sure! Don't blame her for nothing! That's such a sinful thing! I'm not blaming her for nothing! I heard it with my own ears! She said sweating, position! Maybe she meant something else! Shut up. She's out! Wait! -Deniz is here. -She's getting on the bike. -She's going. -So get out, Fatoş! Taxi! The adventure begins. Hit the gas! Get a taxi! She's going. Taxi! Fatoş, this is the house of sin! Come on. Fatoş, come on! -Fatoş, come on! -Alright! We're at some building. We're waiting to hear from you. There are strange sounds coming from here. Wait. We'll catch her in the act! No! She'll put something on. I always keep a sweater ready in case someone knocks on the door suddenly. Why do I need to know about your sex life, Fatoş? Legs up. -Now change position. -Open the door! Bastards-- Take out the camera. -Open it! -Wait a moment, please! Go on, Fatoş. What are you doing here? Yoga! Yeliz? Fatoş? Deniz! What are you doing here? I teach here. And you? We... We came here for pole dancing. Pole dancing? Yes, pole dancing. We get straight to the dancing. We don't do warm-ups. You know how to pole dance? It's rather difficult. We do it all the time! We're good pole dancers, but the pole where we do it is getting worse. It's such a bad piece of metal. -It kind of smells. It doesn't slip. -Did you two follow me? No... Follow you? Nonsense. Don't be silly. Why are you smirking? Don't we look like pole dancers? Please! You can do it if you like, but it's difficult. Fatoş, show them please. No. Show them, let them see! So I'll show them. Get out of my way! We do it all the time! Won't it be hard in those clothes? I always do it in these. Always. Oh, God. Yeliz! -Sister? -Ahmet! -Ahmet! -Deniz! Fatoş! Sister. Sister! -How is she? -She's going crazy. What happened to you? I'm about to go crazy. Crazy! Nothing works on this girl! There's some kind of curse! -We have to solve this completely. -Right. What shall I do, İnci? Hit her with a spade in the mouth? I'm a sister-in-law! Or grab her by the arm turn her in the air and slam her on the ground? Sit on her like a sumo wrestler? Crush her? I'll crush her! Die! What are you doing, İnci? And what am I supposed to do, Sonay? You slut! -What did you say? -Nothing. I didn't say anything. I'll find you! -The woman upstairs got cheated on again. -Her husband never stops. She keeps finding her husband's lovers and beating them with a rolling pin! Right. You slut! Slut? Sorry? So you're my husband's latest plaything! -What husband? -You know what I'll do to you? You slut! You little midget! -Don't run! -There must've been a misunderstanding! Help! Deniz? Are you alright? I'm fine, don't worry. It's just twisted. -They put this on as a precaution. -What happened? The evil eye touched her! A maniac attacked me with a rolling pin, saying "Stop going after my husband!" It's the evil eye, you know. Now I have to testify to the police. -Police? I'll be out. -People are so strange. OK. Does it hurt? No, I'm fine. -How are you? -I'm fine, dear. My dear! I'm so sorry for her. Are you sure? Sure of what? You don't really look sorry. Who? Me? About Deniz? Yes, you. About her. The girl whose hair you stuck gum on, who you snitched to her boss, who you made the victim of perverts by writing her number everywhere. You remember? Ahmet, I didn't do any of that! I'm not telling you all of it. Plus the Uncle Yılmaz incident. -He wasn't an alcoholic. -Good thing he wasn't! I know everything. I've been aware of it since the beginning. Don't you worry. I didn't do anything. Are you even aware of what you're doing? You had her beaten with a rolling pin! What if something worse happened to her? What if she died? Do you hate her so much that you want her to die? Ahmet, I didn't do anything. Fine, you didn't. But don't forget... ...that whatever you do to Deniz... ...you are in fact doing to me. Is Deniz here? Yes, here. Fatoş! -What are you doing here? -She fired me. -So what are you waiting for? -She'll call me back. So you're fired again. -She is a difficult person, right? -Who among us isn't? You suffered a lot for her. Right, but I can't deny all she's done for me. You made us suffer a lot too! She'd wait for you at the window. With no mother or father to look after you... Right. But you didn't forget the things she's done to me, right? I don't want to get between you two. I always end up being affected. You can't anyway, Fatoş. She fired you. Yesterday, for the first time in my life, I was afraid. I never thought she could take things that far. What are you doing here? I'll catch a plane. I'm going to London for two days. I was going to leave things to you, but I see you've been fired too. -Don't worry. We'll call-- -Fatoş! Fatoş, where are you? Don't be sad. You're like hand and glove. She's your sister. Wouldn't Yeliz want you to be happy? This is just how she is. Fatoş! Now, let me go, before she goes even crazier. Fatoş! Where have you been? -You fired me! -Right, but-- Message. A message from Francesco. What is he saying? Hi, Yeliz. I'm Francesco. I'd like to take you out to dinner tonight. Would you like to? Why is he talking like that? He's Italian! I don't know if it's right to go into something unpredictable like that. -What would people say? -Right. I shouldn't just say yes to him. -Yes. -Say it. It's none of your business! It's just a date! What's wrong with trying? You're left all alone by yourself. You're getting into a lot of crazy things. Don't make me mad! Go, it will be a change of air for you! Come on. -She's right. -What's going on? What's all the noise? Welcome, honey. Who knows where you've been. You're dirty all over. Go wash your hands and let's eat. Are you hungry? Can I have my hand back? I'll need it. Thanks. We have this saying in Italy: Two things make a dinner beautiful. Wine and women. If you say so... What shall we eat? You choose. I just want to look at you. With such a dessert, I don't need to eat. Let's just have water at least. I'm fine, Ahmet. There's a meeting tomorrow. I'll be there. I'll tell them that I have an idea. İsmet didn't spare time to listen to me. She'll have to listen tomorrow. You're a real woman, you know? Right, a real geisha. -Geisha? -Right. A real female. You see? You're a real woman, brother. Thank you. You call me brother, you know? Even that sounds nice. You don't need all this make-up. That red lipstick covers up your beautiful lips. With your permission. I'd like to wipe it in another way, but... So, tell me. I'd like to get to know you. Who are you? What do you do? Where do you work? I don't work. I mean, I didn't go to college. I couldn't. What was it you wanted to do? Like I said at that meeting "Man, this woman is really smart." Since I was a child, I've always liked making things beautiful. Presentation is very important for me. For example, if I arranged this table, I would never do it like that. Look at that. What are these toothpicks doing in a place like this? Or, I don't know, look at the bread. They're getting depressed in that napkin. You know, you're very beautiful. You really make everything around you beautiful. Really? My sun That warms me up on a cold day Here's what I'm saying. We raise our daughters like princesses. They were being raised isolated from any danger and reality. We give them rules, limits. We say "Don't do this! Don't do that." So they end up caring only about beauty and glamour. And then they wait for a prince. And did you find your prince? You're not listening to me! I'm trying to tell you something. We need to redefine being a princess. They can achieve anything, if they want to. A princess can be a doctor, architect, or even an astronaut. We have to tell them that. Coming! Deniz, I came here because I was so worried about you. Ahmet is out on a trip. Your foot is hurt. You might be afraid. Anyway, we had a great dinner with Francesco. Why should you stay alone when others are having nice dinners? Come in. Fine, if you really insist, I'll sit for a little while. Were you very busy? No, I just finished a presentation for tomorrow. So, Francesco. Since when have you been going out? In fact, I should've noticed. Francesco keeps asking about you. What did he ask you about me? Is he curious about me? -What is he curious about? -I don't know. It's not that I wonder, but... He was always asking me out, but I kept turning him down because I was so busy. Now, I ran out of excuses. -So, we danced. -You danced? He lifted me up in the air. And he sang a song. Wow! A song? I don't believe it! Wait for me to get some coffee. Crazy guy. Büşra! No, wait, don't go! Please, listen to me. -No! -So? So he is cheating on her with his ex-lover from high school. And she is married to his business partner. Now the woman is pregnant. It's not clear whose baby it is. They'll do a DNA test at the hospital. Don't watch such silly things. Your story is much better. Tell me. Ah, wait. So, we had a chat. He told me how much he liked me. He says he finds me very smart. -Wow! -He took off the lipstick on my lips. He tied back my hair. He said he likes it natural. -Just like me. -Natural. Just like you. That's so romantic. You know, in fact I don't trust men at all. I had this ex-fiancée, God damn him! I don't want to think of him now. Change the subject. Focus on something else. -Don't remember it. -I vouch for him. Really? He's a trustworthy man, isn't he? He doesn't look like someone who can do bad things. He's very cute. This is the first time I'm seeing you so happy. I don't believe it! I forgot to ask Francesco his astrological sign! -I think he was born in December. -Was he? He can't be Scorpio, as he didn't touch me. He is Sagittarian. -What's your sign? -Leo. 30 July. -These two get along well. -I'm an Aries. Yours is a fire sign. Ahmet is a Libra. Air. Air fans the fire! You'll get along well with Ahmet. Libras are very irresponsible. I hope he can get here without missing his plane. Last year he was on a business trip on my birthday. He missed the plane. I was so sad. I was alone on my birthday for the first time. But I have forgiven him. -Leo and Aries get along well too. -You and me? Yes. Brother! 30 July? Fuck, I'm late. Yeliz! I'm late! I'm sure I set the alarm! -What happened? -I'm really late for the presentation! Oh, that's so bad. So bad. -Is the meeting over? -No. -Right, you take these. I'm going in. -Deniz. -İsmet, shall we conclude? -Of course. I'm very sorry, I'm late. I hope I'm not too late. We have one more idea we would like to present to you. Another campaign? Deniz is one of our copywriters. A young, successful and stubborn one. She has a different proposal. Sudi, I think you have two daughters, don't you? -Yes. -I'm sure you raise them like princesses, you treat them with great care. Of course. But do you think people will treat them like princesses when they grow up? Deniz, could you start talking about the campaign... When you raise them like princesses they end up waiting for their handsome prince that will come and save them like in fairy-tales. Is that what you imagine for your daughters? They are strong enough to succeed in everything. -Just like that! -Deniz! İsmet, are you kidding me? You're dead! -Deniz! -I was fired. I really was fired. What are you saying? That's really so bad. I'm so sorry, dear. How did that happen? I don't know how it happened. It's so silly, but it happened. Let me bring you some water. Calm down. What happened? I had a beautiful presentation. I prepared it so well. I'm really shocked right now. Calm down, drink your water. Never mind. You were going to get married anyway! Who cares if you don't work? How could I make such a mistake? I embarrassed myself in front of everyone. It's not like you put photos of naked men in the presentation yourself. This must be some virus. Such things happen. They steal credit card numbers and so on. But of course, why would they care about your presentation? I'll take a bath. I have to go and pick Ahmet up. OK. Don't hurt your-- I'm so badly hurt too. I'm hurting inside. Honey, please, don't worry. Your boss was such a strange woman anyway. You can find another job. Did you tell your sister about these nude men's photos at the presentation? No, why? Hello, İnci? Tell everyone, give them the news. Tell everyone "The wedding is cancelled!" She got fired! From the agency, of course! What happens now that she's fired? She'll take it all out on Ahmet. What happens then? They break up before they get married. That's how I do it! That's how I do it! Francesco Bellini. Sweetheart! You cutie pie! Let's see who you are... ...mister. Francesco. Bellini. The famous advertiser and the mysterious beauty... No way. Mysterious beauty... They were caught together? Or is she... She isn't his lover, is she? You fooled me too? God! I knew it! I've had enough! Did you fool me too? Why does everyone fool me? Why? Why do you do this to me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want? Why do you do this to me? Why? Why? Ahmet! Look at the house! -Yeliz! -Wait a moment! Yeliz! UGLY SQUINT Ahmet, Yeliz is gone! Yeliz! Yeliz, open the door! Tell me, what happened? You're scaring me. Fatoş, go! I'll fire you! Fire me, dear. Just come out, and then you can fire me. Ahmet, dear! -Where is she? -Inside. Open the door! I said open it! -Ahmet, Francesco doesn't-- -Stop it. Don't say my name. Congratulations. You finally did it. She lost her job, thanks to you. Are you happy now? Fatoş, you know, -I did it all for his own-- -Look at me. Are you happy now? Look at me, look me in the eye. Look at me! I love you more than I love myself, you know that, Ahmet. No. You only love yourself. You don't know what it means to be happy. Because you've been trying all your life to make others unhappy. And made everyone run away from you. Now it's finally my turn. There you are, left all alone. Enjoy it. Ahmet, wait! My mother entrusted you to me, right? She wouldn't do any of this. Ahmet, please! Wait! Ahmet, please don't go! Ahmet! Fatoş, don't let him go, please! Fatoş, don't let him go! My sister loves you. "What a pretty girl." she says. She is crazy about you. Crazy. Deniz! I did it all because I envied you! I couldn't let my one and only brother love someone more than me! I have nobody except for him. I have no work, nothing to do. I'm powerless, Deniz. I couldn't go to college either. He told me not to study. "What's studying good for?" Who? My ex-fiancée. And then he went on and cheated on me. He married someone else. Jerk! I wasn't the girl I am now. I had my dreams. I was strong. I was smiling. I was like you. Then I lost it all. All I had was my Ahmet. And I didn't want you to take him from me, Deniz. I wanted you to die! Die! I mean, not now, I didn't mean that. Deniz. It's me who changed the photos. I thought if you were fired you two would break up. When I heard that Francesco had a lover, I went crazy. I think I messed up the house a bit. That's how I am. When I get angry, I lose my senses. I got carried away. -You'll understand me in time. -You're such a bitch. Don't mention it. I wish I could apologize to Ahmet. I made him so angry. Yes, you made him very angry. Ahmet must be somewhere close... Ahmet! This is what my mother would do. You tidied up the house. Do you use contact lenses? Of course. My sister would never want her beautiful eyes to be seen. I understand everything now, but who was Francesco's lover? Francesco? I'll tell you later, Ahmet. Their photos were all over the internet. He and a mysterious beauty. And you vouched for him! Shame on you. -You mean Sylvia! -Right, Sylvia. That's his sister! Is that girl Francesco's sister? I'm such a fool. I'm such an idiot! I've got to think of something else. We have to start wedding preparations! Now that I have no job, I have a lot of time. Nice shot. Get out of there! No boss can ever fire my one and only sister-in-law so easily, Ahmet! -It was half-done anyway. -Half-done? You don't just talk about an idea like that. We'll make a film! A film? What film? You want to run, you can't You want to stop you can't The things you want to do Are not fit for a princess Princess, you can do it You're ready for the toughest With the power in you Princess, you can do it Princess, you can do it -We'd like to speak to Sudi. -Sure, just a moment. -Give him my greetings. -Wait! Where are you going? Have a nice day. My arm! What's going on here? Easy, big shot. We're here to make up for a little mistake of ours. Where's security? Not so fast! Nebo! Nebo, calm down. Lady, wasn't your misbehavior enough? You're right, Sudi. But we have an idea we'd like to present to you. -Easy! -I have a bomb in the bag! Get away! We'd like you to see it. And if you don't like it, we'll quietly leave, right? -Right. -Right. Thanks. Princess, you can do it You're ready for the toughest With the power in you Princess, you can do it İsmet, you got the job. I've just watched your film. Congratulations to you and Deniz. -Yes? -I think we deserve a celebration. Good. I'll leave the couple alone. Because I have someone coming for me. My brother-in-law! Brother-in-law? Franco! Why did you never tell me that you have a sister? I don't have one sister. I have seven older sisters! Seven older sisters? So, they're my sisters-in-law? -Hello? -Babe? Enough already! Don't you have any shame? -Why do you keep calling? -Is it him? Pass me the phone! Why are you disturbing her? I'll smash your face in! I don't disturb anybody! -Wait, stop! -I'll talk! -Hello? -Wow, are you Deniz's stablemate? No, I'm not her stablemate. I'm her sister-in-law. I'd like to ride along with you. Riding along? Does he think I am a horse or what? Where did you see me? Give me the phone! You pervert! How many times do I have to tell you? Hello? Subtitle translation by Deniz Karagöz
