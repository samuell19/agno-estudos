The Masai are showing some anxiety... Kev! Come on! Come on, get off, will ya? Get out! Go on! Get out! Is that the last of them, Jock? All the rest took off before sunup. How long till the next eclipse, Dad? Around here about 177 years. Let's not wait around, huh? Can we go swimming later? Mmm-hmm. Jock, the women are starting to build something inside the boma. I don't think it's Osinkira. What's that? That's the ceremonial hut. But they are getting the other huts ready. Freshening up the colors. Mmm-hmm. They're starting. I got to make my first move today. Yeah, you might do that. Oh! Great white hunter thinks it's too soon, huh? Well, you might give them another day or two to get over the excitement. They're touchy about being photographed at any time. And now you want to move in with a whole film unit. Don't the Masai like us? No, no, Kev, it's not that! It's just that the Masai are a very proud, very... Very private people, and we have to respect that privacy. Hey you're going out for track next year, right? - Yeah. - What would you give to learn the secret of how the Masai warriors can run all day and all night? They can, you know. They train to run full out and nonstop right into battle. They don't even stop to pick up the other warriors because they wear bells on their ankles so while they're running they're sending out the battle call, and then the other warriors in the other villages grab their spears and jump into the run. I'll bet you a quarter I can beat you to camp. It's not loaded. See, no bullets. I was just using the scope to see better. Using the scope to see... Why were you hunting Masai? I wasn't. I was only playing a game. - Who are you? - Kevin Whitlock. He asked, "Where you from?" I assume you are an American? Yes, I am. And I assume you came to see the eclipse? Yes, I did. Well, that's very nice but the eclipse is finished now! Isn't it? Yes, but my father's an anthropologist. He say you throw stones at his cows. Oh, that, well, we were... They were going to run into us. Damn it, I should have more blankets. One for each of the elders. Well, we can check, see how many elders there are first. Hey, something going on here. Soba. Hi, Jock. Hi, Dad. Kevin, what the hell is going on here? Is this your son? Ah, yes. Do you teach him to point guns at people? No. No, I don't. Is that what he does at home? Kevin, what were you doing? I was just looking through the scope, that's all. The gun is empty. The boy was playing a game, I'm sure he meant no harm. My son is very sorry he disturbed your people. I promise you it will never happen again. Thank you. Again, I apologize for my son. One moment! Your son tells me that you are an anthropologist. Are you connected with a university? A museum in Philadelphia. Ah, you find the Masai interesting, do you? Anthropologically? Uh, that's why I'm here. All the way from Philadelphia? Just to study us? How would you go about it? Well, I was hoping I'd be allowed to photograph. But did I not see you taking some photos? Oh, you mean yesterday? Yesterday... Yes, yes, I was taking some background shots for a little film I did on the eclipse. Except of course, the background becomes very close with a 250 millimeter lens. Jock, I'll see you back at the camp. Let's take a walk, Kevin! I'm trying to make friends with the Masai, and before I even meet them, you blow the whole thing with that little pop gun! I'm sorry. Oh, you're sorry. Thank you. Unfortunately, that doesn't help. Can't we go to another village? No, we can't go to another village! This is the only village having the only Eunotoin East Africa, and it may be the last one, Kev! That's why I'm here! Can't you understand that? Look... I told you, and I meant it. I'm gonna make as much time for us to be together as I possibly can. But when I'm busy, Kev, I'm busy. Let's face it, that was a dumb and dangerous thing to do! Kevin, those Masai warriors are fierce! You're lucky you didn't get yourself skewered! Now look, I'm already stretching my visitation rights as it is by taking you out of the States. All I have to do now is go home and say to your mother, "Sorry, Kev won't be back! "The Masai enjoyed him so much "they had him for dinner. Shish kebab." Well, what's the difference with me looking at 'em through a scope, and you looking at 'em through a camera? Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, that wasn't such a smart thing to do, either. - Jambo! - Jambo. Take a shower. - Well, what's the matter? - What's that? That's a hyena. Damn, I thought I told you under no circumstances to ever leave your tent at night! I was scared. Yeah, well you ought to be. That thing could have ripped you apart. There's a sleeping bag under the bed. You better stay here tonight. We want to take pictures inside the Manyatta. He says, "Why?" We want our people to know you. Lomoiro, people all over the world are changing. Only the Masai keeps his traditions. Is true to his life. Independent of the rest of the world. And you don't believe in change? No, no, not for its own sake. What about for our sake? I have tested your civilization and found it wanting, for the most part. But change we must. Grow we must. Learn we must. Perhaps even from you, in a small way. Don't deny us that! He says why do you want to see the Eunoto? We understand that the Eunoto is when your young warriors put aside their spears and become elders. It's a time when the whole Masai family comes together and celebrates the growth of their sons. Lomoiro say, "The Eunotois only for Masai. "Not for foreigners." But why do you only speak of the Eunoto? Maybe you will see many other things of interest for your museum. I want to see everything. As much as I can but the Eunoto is very important to me. It's very special. Why? Get out! Go on, get out! Leave him alone! Stop! Scram! They must have thought it was loaded. It's not really. See? Really. Look! Hey! Come! Come on! Take a drink. No way! Oh, just look. - Have a drink. - No! All right, it doesn't matter. Let's go! Let's go! Shower time! All right. I see you found a friend. Yeah. What's his name? I don't know. Well, how'd you happen to meet? I don't know. You know... Does he speak English? Yeah, he's been to school. No kidding! That's great. Are you going to see him again? I might. Well, I think you should, don't you? If you want me to. Kevin, it's not what I want. It just seems like a pretty good opportunity. Behind the ears. - Hey, Dad! - Yeah? Well, did you talk to 'em over at the village? - Yep. - What'd they say? Well, I told them we wanted to see the Eunoto, and they're thinking about it. In the meantime, though, I think we can look around all we want. Hey, that's great. Hey, what do you say tomorrow we go over to the Manyatta and see your friend? Yeah, I guess so. Would it be all right if I took a few... Just a few photographs? - Yes, yes, go ahead. - Ah, thank you. Soba! You know, of course, the first day we met... You really knocked me off my feet speaking the King's English so well, huh? Where did you learn? Well, let's see. How long have the British been in East Africa? I learned in school from your generous missionary. And then later on from the generous British in Nairobi. Tell me why do you find the Masai interesting? You, personally? Is it because they are primitive? I notice you say, "They." They are my people! I am Masai! Oh, in Nairobi I wear a necktie and a clean shirt every day. So perhaps I'm not primitive enough for you. I can't tell yet. There are so many things I don't understand. So many things I don't know. You, for instance. Now, you leave a good job in Nairobi, a good life, to come back here. Why? Very simple. Where else can I really be myself? You're a lucky man. At least you've got a place to do that. Any suggestions for me? Where'd you get it from? I brought it from Lake Nakuru. Hey, dad, look at this. Hey, that's a beauty. Flamingo. My nephew went to fetch it to prove that he's growing up. That's what every Masai boy must do at the beginning of his manhood. Be on his own. Face danger. A sort of initiation. - Shall I take you there? - Hey! Oh, well, how far would he have to go? Oh, a journey of perhaps three days. I think you'll do without your feather. Do you wish to go? His father does not wish it. Maybe sometime you can ask your father to take you. It's not so long by car. Yeah. Maybe. The Chief's painting this for the Eunoto, right? That's right. The mysterious ceremony. How long will it be until the next one? Oh, rather a long time. Yeah, and what's a long time? Oh, perhaps seven years. I wonder where the Masai will be then. Where do you think? Look at us. Look at this. The world's most stubborn people. But beautiful! How to keep this beauty and still progress. That's what I want for my people. That's a good thing to want. # Row, row row your boat # Row, row row your boat # Gently down the stream # Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily # Life is but a dream # Row, row row your boat # Row, row row your boat # Gently down the stream # Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily # Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily # Life is but a dream Chief, etusca, yes? Here. Kevin, bring the Chief a beer. Sit right down here. Nemolok. Sit over there. All right. There we go. The picture's going. Here. Lomoiro, Lomoiro, look, look here. Look, there's a baby in the back of the tent. Now back down over. Now pan left and get the mama. Just over to the side. That's it, Jock. Chief, I'm sorry, that's all the pictures I have, but it was good to see you and all the people enjoy it so much. If you give me permission to film the Eunoto in the Manyatta, we'll have much fun together, and it's very easy to do. Then you and I will both have a picture memory of the Eunoto. Will you excuse me for a moment? He wishes to talk to me. - Dad? - Yes. Codonyo wants to know if I can spend the night at his place? Umm... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Wake up. Let's go. I want to show you something. So that's how the Masai get so tough. They take a lot of cold baths, huh? He sat all the night in the stream - to help the pain. - What pain? The pain of the circumcision. - You want to see it? - No way. Okay, let's go. They suffocate a goat and he will eat it for strength. Hi, Kev. - Can't sleep? - Mmm-mmm. You feel okay? Your belly ache or something? No. You, um, can't quite shake what you saw this morning, huh? I can't say that I blame you. I'd probably feel the same way if I'd seen it. That is without a lens in front of me. I can look at anything through a camera. But I really do know how you feel. The test of manhood is how much pain you can take, hmm? Well, it's not so different with us. But to cut a boy that age with no pain killer. You know... If he had even flinched, they would have stoned him to death. And that's brutal. It's inhuman. It wasn't like that. It wasn't? It... It was exciting. He knew they were sort of celebrating for him. And they took care of him. They sang. They danced. They planted a tree for him. They were all for him. Yeah. Yeah, I guess the Masai at least knows for better or for worse that he's got his tribe. They planted a tree for him, huh? I wish I'd been there with you. This is everything that a Masai needs. You would say his capital. Soba. Are they going to kill it? Why? What for? Now we add the sweetener. What's the matter? - I'm okay. - He's fine. There! Blood for strength, milk for nobility. You see? No artificial ingredients. Maybe this is why the Masai is so simple and natural. It may work for you as well. Certainly worth a try. Well, it's very good. Excellent. And now, what about you? No, thanks. Go ahead. It's good for you. Kevin, why don't you give it a try? Hey, look at the zebras! Why don't you go look at the zebras? What the hell do you think you're doing? This isn't a shooting gallery. The best you could have done with this damn thing would have been to maim one of those animals. I was only trying to show you I could do it. You keep your hands off this! You never touch it again, you hear me? Never! Grow up! I can't do anything right! Do you want to go for the feather? For what? To Lake Nakuru. Oh. You want to go tomorrow? Hi. Hey. Who're they? They're Sipolios, bringing ostrich feathers for my cousin. Will you take me to the lake? You know, like you promised for the flamingo feather? Oh, yes. - Take this. - No, you keep it. Oh, just take it. Aren't you going to get your things? I'm ready. Let's go. Who were those guys anyway? They were circumcised before my cousin. Boy, they sure look weird. Oh, no. Kevin, don't go there. Come this way. That is my old school. I don't want the headmaster to see me. # Jesus, my savior Son of God # Who came to suffer For our sins # Jesus, my savior Son of God # Who came to suffer For our sins # Oh, now Come and bless me # Come and bless me # Come and bless me # Oh, now Come and bless me Come on, Kevin! # He was without sin Son of God # Who came to suffer For our sins # He was without sin Son of God # Who came to suffer For our sins # Oh, now Come and bless me # Come and bless me # Come and bless me Boy, does that one feel good. You want some? Yes. Hey, don't take it all. Hmm? I want to know where they went. Oh, I could probably find them. I went on the same track myself as a boy. He's with Codonyo, he knows. Wonderful! But I don't know. I can understand your confusion. But, I can also understand Kevin's. I was there with you at the zebras. I think I understand. He can't please you. He can't please himself. However, let me tell you, Codonyo is a clever boy. And Kevin couldn't find a better guide in the whole of Africa. And I trust him. And with Codonyo perhaps Kevin might find something he needs. You might think about that. Look! Morans hunting lion! Hey look! Whydah birds mating. It's their mating dance. Hey, look at that water! Yahoo! Come on, let's go! Hey, let's take a swim! Ah, you are already circumcised. Kevin! Help, help! My foot is caught! Help, help, pull! Pull, help, help me! Hey, yeah! Any hippos ever come around here? Oh yes, sometimes. Sometimes comes... It's an elephant. And..., it's a lion. - And... - What's that? Monkey. Sometimes come... Comes rhino. Rhino? They don't ever come around the fire, do they? Oh, sometimes they come. Do you like your father? Yeah, yeah, sure I do. Sure. Sure. What about yours? Oh, yes. He's a man. He's a chief. Uh, 12, 24. You may be right. That's probably what I had in mind in the first place, I want him to be, uh, independent of his, uh, mother and me. Except, I wanted to be the one who showed him how. To impose independence, how typically American. Well, of course, the Masai let their young, flower freely and naturally, You've got your own ugly ways of imposing on people. So, you now find something lacking in the pure Masai culture. Mmm-hmm. But you'll forgive me if I don't get involved in because at the moment my son is lost in the African bush. No, my friend, it's you who's lost in the African bush. Um, try making a word, will you? Hey, look! Do you like that? My father said there was once this much game in the States. See, the warriors, they killed a black-maned lion. - Black mane? - Very fierce. Kevin! See, the women are cleaning his wounds. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Hey, come here! Come on! Hey, let's get out of here! Does this river flow into the Flamingo Lake, I hope. You tired? - No. - Yes, you are. Why do we have to pitch camp so early? I'm starved! - Have some milk. - Yuck, you call that milk? I can't even stand the taste of that stuff. It's very good. I mean, I want real food. You sure we're gonna get to the lake tomorrow morning? Oh, yes! I'm gonna catch a hundred fish and eat 'em all by myself. What are you doing in there? Get out! Who told you you could sleep in there? God told me. Well, God's telling you to get out! Get out! It's my sleeping bag. You think you are God? Oh, dry up and go to sleep! Bad friend. Shut up and go to sleep! Ah! Help! It's all right, it is friendly. It's all right. I'm gonna look for Kevin. - Will you show me the way? - Let him alone! He'll be back. I don't want to let him alone! I have to find him. And I need help. Pull over by the tent. Whose plane is it? Wh... Where's the pilot? It belongs to Provincial Commissioner. Good chap. Lets me use it any time I like. Come on! What do you think you're doing? Taking you to your son, isn't that what you wanted? It's all right, don't look so worried. Come on! Hi. Hi. You okay? Yeah. Come on. Why did you come? I found out that I had to make this trip myself. I came to get a feather. Nemolok, thank you. While we're here, I wonder if we could find out if there've. About the eunoto, you mean? Let me have a word with Lomoiro. I'll let you know later. Don't you ever do that to me again! I was all right. Yeah, sure, you were all right! Robert, I'd like to speak to you. Do what you like, but my advice is to keep out of it. How do I tell him? Tell him the truth. That's the way they die. - Are you sure she's still alive? - Yes. All right, let's go. Here she is! Shh... Jock, get the stretcher. What's wrong with her? She's very, very old and they brought her here. With all these hyenas? Kevin, that's what they do. Are you sure you want to do this? Kev! All right, uh, let's get her out of here. Yes, uh... Lomoiro. Jock! Jock... The word has got out. He knows that, uh, the old lady's in your hands. Maybe some of the camp staff let him know. Tell him, uh, she's dead, and I'm very sorry. He says he wants to take her away. Yes well... - Tell him I'm sorry. - Come on. What'd they say, Dad? They're not feeling very friendly. Did you tell them it was my fault? No, no, I didn't, because it wasn't your fault. I knew the risk. Shall I tell them to start packing up camp? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How soon can we, uh, get out of here? I would think by tomorrow sometime. - Dad? - What? Oh, you better put in a radio call to Gilbert in Nairobi and tell. - Dad? - What? What if you'd found her instead of me? Let's talk about that later on, all right, Kev? Boy, I bet Codonyo is really in trouble. Oh, I don't know, it depends. But he didn't do anything. He's your friend. Difficult to say how much they're gonna make of that sort of thing. Off you go and pack, Kevin. They want to know what you are doing here. I want to explain about what happened. They say they don't want you here. It was my fault. My father, he knew no one was supposed to touch her. But he had to try to help her, on account of me. It was my fault, the whole thing. - Your father sent you? - No, he doesn't even know I'm here. Kevin, do you understand that you interfered? Yes. And that it was our business, and not yours. I know. Then I suggest you tell Lomoiro what you just told me. I know I interfered in your business. But it's my fault, not Codonyo's, not my father's, just me. Lomoiro asks if you would ever do such a wicked thing again? Will you, Kevin? I don't know. See, the thing is, if I see someone that looks real sick, I would try to help them. I guess I'd do it again. Lomoiro says he sees a black mane. Oh? A black-maned lion is the bravest there is. Tell your father to come. Lomoiro wishes to speak with him. But without cameras. Thank you. You see, the Morans come from many villages to join the eunoto. Hi. What are they arguing about? Well, tradition has it that the one that has been selected goes out of the circles and goes to the Chief. He begs for mercy. But nothing can change the decision. An elder he must be. Come over here. You can see better. You see, the elders have rejected his plea. Now they take him into the circle to have his head shaved. You see how the warriors resist? They have fits. Like trances. They know their time has almost come. I wish you had a camera. I feel fine without it. And now comes the time of rejoicing. The new elders are honored. The dancing will continue until sunset. He wishes to make you an honorary member of the Masai tribe. Now you can come back any time you wish as a fully fledged Masai. And you'd be most welcome. Lomoiro sees a man of great courage. And of honor. So do I. - Sere. - Sere. Hello, Kevin, sere. Good bye. Good bye. Hey, Kevin! I see a Masai! Good bye. - Sere. - Sere.
