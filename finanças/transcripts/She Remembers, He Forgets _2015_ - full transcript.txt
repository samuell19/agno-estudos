How many people will be going? How many days are you going for? When are you planning to go? Next month? I'm sorry. I can only check within a specific time frame. How can I help you? A lot of people from Hong Kong like to stay there because it's close to a mall. Are you going for your honeymoon? Yes, we are. What a great choice. One adult and one child. Once it is amended, print a copy for the clients. -Okay. -Hey, Fung Chi. -Yes, sir? -Can you get me the tenancy agreement? -Are you going to increase the rental? -Hotels have been built nearby. Our business is not getting any better. The world is in such a turmoil. People think twice now before spending money on vacations. Manila? It's still pretty dangerous there. We should go to Tokyo instead. Scientists say that the fishes are affected by radiation. We'll die if we eat them. Where would you like to go then? I've already said that I'd like to go to Bangkok. I'm afraid of the riots there. Try Sun Moon Lake. You always know what to recommend to the customers. When was the last time you had a vacation? I haven't had a holiday with my husband in the last five years. By the way, have you been working here for ten years? It has been 15 years, sir! YING YAN ALUMNI REUNION Yu Fung Chi! You can't hear us because you're always on your Walkman. You need to go to the exhibition. Hurry! It's about to start! Isn't the deadline at noon? What is there to see? Exactly, the deadline is just around the corner. -Hey, we're here. Don't you need help? -It should be the Rose Garden from 6A. -The Rose Garden is none of our business. -Let's go. Come on! May, stop looking. Why are you guys so slow? She only ever listens to her Walkman. -Hurry up. -Wait a second. What are you doing, Master Handicraft? OUR WET DREAM Yu Fung Chi? -Master Handicraft! -Master Handicraft! -Master Handicraft! -Master Handicraft! -You're late! -Where's my bag? Sorry. See how excited he is! -You're extremely late. -What? Since you're late, why don't you apologize to our classmates? Since it's my wife's order, I, Pang Shing Wah, sincerely apologize to my old classmates. -All right. -Stop bowing to me. -Shall I start writing some lines? -There's no need. -Dinner's on me, okay? -Okay! Are you crazy? Let's just drink! -All right. -Hey! You need to drive. I won't drink. My wife forbids me to do so. You're so bitch whipped, no wonder you're loaded. -I'm not loaded yet. -Really? Yes. And also, I always have the say. But only when I'm at home. When I'm out, of course, I listen to Mrs. Pang, right? You're the only one who can make Fung Chi happy. Not really, you're looking more and more attractive. I can make you happy too. I'm not kidding. Your wife is right here, and you're flirting with other girls? This guy flirts with both guys and girls. That's true. Do you guys remember that song? All the girls were impressed. -Yes. -Yes. I didn't get to hear the song as I was helping you out. I haven't heard of it ever since. How about this? Let's sing it right now! -Of course! -Of course! Shing Wah, you were late. Your punishment is to sing. -Sing now. -To repay a debt. Sing! Aaron Kwok... I forgot the lyrics. Fung Chi will tell you the lyrics. Her memory is better. Why aren't you singing? Check it out, they're so lovey-dovey. Which guy in our class is still a bachelor? Oh Kwok Hung. Even he's married. And then there's Sin Kwok -Keung! -Keung! He's settled down in Canada, and has a kid. There was a guy called Chan Si Sheng. Chan Si Sheng is gay. He's pursued me before though. No wonder he turned gay. So Bok Man Yes, So Bok Man. Where is he? So Bok Man, the guy who sang with you. Where did he go? What is he doing? I remember that he was always launching those water rockets. We never saw them come down. I was flipping through the old school magazines and saw him. Looks like there was some news about him. I wanted to bring it today. -But I forgot. -You have a terrible memory. Wait a minute. You guys used to be tight. You guys didn't keep in touch? No. It was the last semester of high school. He suddenly quit school and disappeared. Yes, it was during the school's Open Day. People saw him limping across the quads. I saw that too. Somebody said that a white shadow always followed him. Come on, I still need to work at Ying Yan every day. Hey. You go first. How about going on a vacation? Didn't we just go on a vacation? That was five years ago. Has it been five years? You said that we should go paragliding the last time but we didn't do it. Let's talk about it later, I have a lot of work to do. It's your turn to talk. About what? Nothing. Am I a middle-aged housewife? You're not mad, are you? Are you crazy? Who drives like that? Do you think you're a king racer? What were you saying just now? I'm done talking. I addressed you as "Mrs." but I didn't mean it. I also said that Cindy was attractive but that doesn't mean that she is-- I said that I'm done talking. I was just trying to lighten up the mood at the gathering. That's just the way I talk. Don't sleep too late. What? I still have work to do at the office. What's wrong? You're mad again? I'm not mad that you have to work. But how would I know if you don't tell me? I'm telling you now. I'll just throw the soup away. You knew that we were eating out, and you made soup? It was made two days ago. Do you live here? Honey. I'll drink it all when I'm back from work. Even if it's cold, even if it makes me sick! YING YAN COLLEGE 1992-1993 THIRD YEAR OF SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL GROUP PHOTO Stop checking her out. Focus. No. She's really pretty. She's Yu Fung Chi from Class A. She just transferred from St. Clarence. Her measurements are 32, 22-- You asshole, how would you know that? I bumped into her once at the vending machine and she wanted to get a drink. But she only had a 20-dollar note. I was looking for some change, and I only had a 5-dollar coin. So I just bought her a Vitasoy. You bought her a drink? You must have just pretended to not have any change! Have you memorized the lyrics? Shit! Why is that old hag doing her rounds now? Sit down! You two, sit down properly! Let's go back to the original version. Are you crazy? I spent a whole week working on this. And now you're telling me to sing the original version? She was really cool, wasn't she? Yes, indeed. A huge thanks to the great dancer Cindy Leung from Class A. Our next performers are equally talented and entertaining. -Who could it be? -Who could it be? Let's welcome Pang Shing Wah and So Bok Man from Class S! Welcome. You asshole! Just wing it. The mountain is tall The trees are green Be wise, reflective and reliable Bring glory to our school The school anthem? Give my Dragon Ball comic back to me! What a teacher's pet! You ass kissers! Get off the stage! Yim! Get out! Come and join us Tomorrow is full of hope Like heaven bestowing rain Upon all living creatures Someone is smoking in the toilet. What? How dare he! I'm going to get him. Don't waste the good times ahead Come with me to testify! Today, we move forward To realize our goals Aaron Kwok, you got beef with me? He wants to make a water rocket And shoot our school to the sky I went on stage and met Yu Fung Chi Mr. Luk's bald spot aroused Ms. Chan My unending love For you will last forever Jimmy Lin and Andy Lau Will duke it out with Leon Lai Who gets to hide? Who gets to dodge? After today What will happen to the Rose Garden? Super Saiyan will not accept defeat I'll eat dim sum While you copy my homework I read comic books in class Going to nip your nipple in the morning And cut off your dick in the afternoon That guy wearing Levi's is so cocky Why did the teacher Bring a pager to class? None of us know for sure What's going to happen in the next century Let's meet up at the Handover in 1997 See you back in Hong Kong So, with the results of your votes, -the Best Performance Award -the Best Performance Award goes to... -Shing Wah and Bok Man from Class S! -Shing Wah and Bok Man from Class S! Firstly, I'd like to thank Ying Yan College for such an endearing school anthem. Besides that, I'd like to thank Yu Fung Chi who was in charge of the lighting and the smoke machine. Let's give her a round of applause! Fifi. Did you sleep well last night? You're full of energy now, aren't you? Let me give you something to eat, okay? Here you go. Let's do some exercise, shall we? One, two, three, four. I'll take you to the vet after I get home from work today, all right? The sandwich is on the dining table. Don't throw your dirty clothes everywhere. Good morning! Hey! Hey! Shing Wah. Rose is here, and she's really pissed. What? We have work today? Shing Wah, I'm not kidding. -We can't hold on much longer. -All right, you deal with it first. I'm on my way back. What's with you guys? What about the concepts that I talked about previously? Which one of them did you manage to achieve? Actually, Rose, we agreed previously that-- How many times have I told you that the first concept is luxury and the second concept is oriental colors? Which one of those have you achieved? Good morning, Rose. I've been waiting for you, Mr. Pang. Did you have an ionic perm again? Mr. Pang, I don't see the outcome of the concepts I gave. It's this brand, right? Rose, do you remember what you said to me the first time I went to your office? You said that Yuan Ming Palace needs to face the world. Yes, I did say that. I bought this ashtray from Rome. It costs 500 Euro, but it's made in China. And tourists were queueing up to get it. What does that have to do with my concept? The most important concept behind this design is fusion. We need to use modern and contemporary design to interpret the traditional elements and then allow it... to face the world. It's okay if you don't understand. I've prepared some books for you to flip through. I brought them over especially for you. This is from Sotheby's current auction. This is on Japanese design, and this one is from Germany. These are award-winning books. You might not be able to digest it in a short amount of time. But I can go through all of them with you and list out all the main concepts about how to use modern design to interpret traditional values and allow the luxurious Yuan Ming Palace to shine with its western colors. Oriental. Are you interested in an oriental sauna? Just kidding. Let's get a drink at the Mandarin Oriental? Come on. Rose and I are going to talk about the details over drinks. Thank you, Rose. Goodbye. Rose, how do you keep your fringe so nice. Hey. You're good. You got rid of her within three strikes.? Treat women as if you're crossing the road. Red means stop, and green means go. What do they call you again? Cougar Tamer. You're the Cougar Tamer among the Chinese designers. Thanks for that. Hey, a piece of advice. Don't bring back a Mainland Chinese girl. -What? Seriously? -You're married. And? -Stop it and get back to work! -All right, I'm going. Go and work on your Yuan Ming Garden. -It's Yuan Ming Palace! -It's all the same to me. Go on, eat something. Face the world! ARE YOU REALLY TOO BUSY TO CALL ME? I REALLY MISS YOU TONIGHT. SHANGHAI CAESAR'S NIGHTCLUB SHANGHAI CAESAR'S NIGHTCLUB SO BOK MAN AVIATION CLUB AVIATION CLUB So Bok Man! AVIATION CLUB Yu Fung Chi. So Bok Man. I'll help you push it. All right. You don't need to go to class? You don't have a class either? Economics class is so boring, so I'm just out for a bathroom break. How about you? I already know everything that they teach in physics, so I got the teacher to sign me off to come down and work on some stuff. "Aviation Club"? What do you guys do? Play Airplane Chess? Pump it up to 30. All right. I'll help you. Stand over there. -Almost done? -Yes. Three, two, one! That's awesome! Will it hit the birds? I'm trying to reach 300 feet to enter into the Water Rocket Championships. -Three hundred feet? That's amazing. -Give way! Give way! -Mr. Tak. -Mr. Tak. So Bok Man, are you skipping class again? Don't mind him. We're good buddies. Mr. Tak is awesome. He takes care of all the plants. And the pipes, the plumbing, the equipment in the labs. He takes care of all of those. He's integral to my plane and water rocket projects. Can I have a look? Your drawings are quite unique. Why is the sky purple? It's quite pretty. Do you remember So Bok Man? So Bok Man. THIS IS YU FUNG CHI DO YOU STILL REMEMBER ME? MESSAGE SENT Thank you. That would be 500 dollars, please. -Mr. Pang, it's been a while. -Yes. Well, I've been busy with work. Are the flowers for your wife? No. It's for my high school sweetheart. -What's going on? -That hurts. What's going on, honey? -What's going on? Are you okay? -Your necktie. I told you not to leave your things lying around. All right, it's gone. Are you okay? Are you really okay? I'm sorry about last night. These flowers are pretty. Why? Is there a new store opening downstairs? Why didn't you get me a bigger bouquet? Just kidding. I'll put it in a vase later. I'll do it. Have you been busy at work lately? You always seem so preoccupied. It's nothing. A client is just being really annoying. She wants to investigate her husband and see if he has a mistress in China. That's no big deal. When I say that it's no big deal, I don't mean that having a mistress is no big deal. I'm just saying... You think that I'm having extracurricular activities? Does it hurt? Are you okay? As long as you weren't serious about it. How did a lighter from Shanghai get to Hong Kong? I just picked it up at the Shenzhen Airport. You work at a travel agency. You should know that. Are you sure that you're all right? I think that we really lack communication. I don't even know what you do every day. These planes look good, but they don't fly. Shing Wah made these. Who's better between the two of you? Who do you think? Shing Wah designed this board for me. He said, "Why do people assume that this is the front? Why can't we think of this side as the front?" Shing Wah's thoughts can be pretty interesting. Needless for you to say. What? A scandalous couple. Take this back. Thanks. I'm done being scandalous. I'm heading back to class. -I have to get back to the classroom. -Wait! I'll take you. Get on board. Stand right there. Can you even fathom these? A dragon, a phoenix, a tortoise and a griffin. How do we even get these onto the four pillars? This is crazy. It's too much work. Why do we even need these sculptures? We might as well have Snoopy, Garfield, or Mickey Mouse. How about the characters created by the society? Such as naughty chicks and impotent lover. What else is there? Stop messing around! Even if the client wants your dick sculpted, we'll make it happen. The customer is always right. She's the tits that feed us the milk! Let's get to work. Come on. Give yourselves a round of applause. LINA CALLING Why aren't you replying my texts? Is something bothering you? Your tone is so different than from when we were in Shanghai. Lina, I want to apologize to you. The first time that I met you, it felt like I'd known you since forever. We really got along, so-- Stop it, we're not kids anymore. The next time we meet up, perhaps I shouldn't drink. That's the lighter the waiter gave us, right? You said that the lady's pose was very weird and you kept on laughing about it. Didn't you think so too? This lighter, don't let your wife see it. We're separated by a computer. I can drink with you then. I don't know why. Sometimes, you remind me of my ex-boyfriend. Do you only talk to me when you miss him? You're nothing like him. It's just that when I'm with you, I feel like I'm young and in love again. Honey, did you help me wipe my face last night? Thanks. Call me when you get off work today. Someone texted you last night. Told you to go meet her in Shanghai. You're thinking too much. Whatever. Read all of my messages. See if there's anything in there. -I need to get back to work! -So do I! Back then, why did my husband get all of you to drag me to the Rose Garden? And in such a hurry? Let me think. Moonhead was making his rounds at 12 p.m. Moonhead was making his rounds at 12 p.m.? I think I remember that. Moonhead had told your husband to build the Rose Garden then. Yes, your husband used to put all of his secrets in there. But if Moonhead saw it when he made his rounds, he would have told him to make changes for sure. And it wouldn't have been the same then. That was why we had to get you up there before 12 p.m. and in such a hurry. Your husband was working on it until 11 something. He didn't know where you were, so he asked Cindy and me to go and look for you. What about Bok Man? You said that he was limping. When did you see that? When I was looking for you. Come on! May, stop looking. Maybe he bumped into something. You guys were tight. You didn't ask him? What about the white shadow? There wasn't any white shadow. That's all bullshit. Why did you throw a ball at me? I threw a ball at you? Yes. I remember that. I saw you and kept yelling your name. But your earphones were plugged into your ears. The volleyball girls happened to pass by, so I took their ball and threw it at you. Yu Fung Chi! Sorry sir, I am not feeling well. Can I take a half-day today? Students, the theme for Ying Yan College's Open Day is "The Future." The year 1997 is approaching in a few years. China will take back Hong Kong's jurisdiction soon. A lot of people are worried about an uncertain future. They're all afraid of this and that. I'm telling you, Hong Kong is a goose that lays golden eggs. Who would want us to die? There are a lot of opportunities ahead of you. According to the Chinese scholar Hu Shih, -"Every -"Every -man -man -needs -needs -to -to -have -have -his -his -own" -own" Wet dream! EVERY MAN NEEDS TO HAVE HIS OWN DREAM. Who was that? -It was him! -That's him! Who was that? -Stand up! -Stand up! -Wet Dream Doug! -Wet Dream Doug! EVERY MAN NEEDS TO HAVE HIS OWN DREAM. Dreams belong to the young. Don't squander your youth like Doug. All of you have a Dream Planner in your hands. This method is based on the extensive research of a famous educator named Hattis to allow all of you to get to know your own dreams. Dreams can be divided into three categories. The first category is, what you want to do. The second category is, what you can do. The third category is, -what society needs you to do. -Quick. Quickly. And the pursuit of your dreams, can be divided into four phases. The first one is the Determination phase. And finally, the fourth one is the Maintenance phase. Pang Shing Wah. Yes. Stand up. Listen to me. If I remember correctly, you're the president of the Art Club. I want you to set up a special art committee and transform this activity room into an exhibition dedicated to the Rose Garden for our school's Open Day. Use your creativity to portray Hong Kong's major infrastructure projects in the next decade. -What would you like to have? -Rice with sweet corn and pork? Wet Dream Doug. Stop bothering him. -Are you ready for the Open Day? -The Open Day is hardly open at all. That whole Dream Planner thing is a drag too. You should take it seriously. He might pick you. And you'll have something to say during your university interview. Class president, you're the ambassador of positive thinking. I hope that you get into the CUHK Medical School. I'll come to you if I need a doctor's note in the future. What did you pick, Cindy? I want to study dance at the Academy of Performing Arts, but my dad would kill me! Goodness. I think your dad is right. You can dance whenever you want. Listen, come with me to Hong Kong University. All the handsome lawyers and engineers are at Hong Kong University. Maybe you'll marry a successful bachelor and you can dance whenever you want, Cindy! Cindy, don't listen to her. If you want to dance, then dance. Who's actually doing the picking here? What are you doing, Fung Chi? Isn't that true, though? How do you know that the guy is the one? How would you know that he's not? Let's do some fortune-telling. Let me look into your future, Cindy Leung. Because you wanted to meet a lawyer boyfriend, you chose to study accounting at Hong Kong University. And you have classes at Sai Ying Pun every day. You're exhausted and dealing with a lot of pressure. So you started having breakouts and dark circles. -Your menstrual cycle... -Is messed up! None of the guys would even look at you. The efforts of Cindy Leung to find a lawyer boyfriend at Hong Kong University eventually turned her into a crazy old hag! Fung Chi, you're so mean. -I don't want to go crazy. -I'll still pick Hong Kong University. Go ahead and become crazy old hags. I definitely won't become one! I don't want to! That's filthy! Fung Chi! I have to go. Good luck turning crazy! I'm going to have my revenge! Hey! Hey! Excuse us! -Sorry! -Crazy! Fung Chi. This place is awesome. How did you guys find it? It was passed down from the seniors. It's reserved for VIP only. In that case, I'm honored. Is there an entrance fee? There's no need. Just help me out with the Rose Garden project. Hey. What about my Aviation Club? We need help with that on the Open Day too. Nobody knows how to deal with your water rockets. They wouldn't be of much help. Stop arguing. I'm really clueless about planes and rockets. And the Rose Garden project is a huge endeavor. However, I'm not too interested either. If you renovate the Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park next time, I'll reconsider! Hey, wait up! Hey Bok Man, why do you like airplanes so much? Story time again! When I was little, my family moved to Kowloon City. My mum was worried that the airplane noise would scare me. So she took me to the roof every day, to listen to and observe the planes. So I would watch the planes fly by every single day. Before I knew it, I was hooked. Bok Man can distinguish the sounds of 36 different types of aircraft. Thirty-eight. Is it really 38? Yes. Are you really that good? I'll teach you some other time. Hey. How many people are looking at the Lion Rock right now? There should be quite a few. If the three of us were to go up there, we'd be able to wave at a lot of people. Don't you think that we're starting to sound a little bit silly? Yes, I think so too. It's almost time to go. What? Let's go. We'll come back next time. After I finish my homework tonight, I have to watch a TV drama, The Greed of Man. Really? Tonight's episode is about "The Day of Miracles." Look after her. What about yourself? Exactly. You sucker! You're retaliating? It's terrified. Don't be afraid, little parrot. You poor little parrot. What are you doing here all by yourself? Did your master abandon you? You must be sad, being abandoned like this. I've been abandoned before as well. It's okay. If they don't want you, I'll take you in. Come home with me, okay? I won't treat you like they did. You've helped us out with the rockets every time. Why not this time? Mr. Tak, we'll come to see her every day. We won't keep her here for long. Just until we find a suitable place for her to stay. Is that okay, Mr. Tak? Look how cute she is. PARROTS She's this species. You're right. It's this one. -I'll write it down. -Is this correct? Keep it. You could have torn it in a better way. I want to use the toilet. Come on! What happened? She shitted on your head! Wipe it off first. All right. New home. She loves the cage we made her. Hey. You dropped something. Thanks. Are you guys from the Aviation Club? What? I'm an alumna of the school. I was also in the Aviation Club before. I see. You're an alumna. What were you saying about an Aviation Club? Fung Chi. -Mr. Hing Kin. -Mr. Auyeung. There's no need to address me formally. Let me introduce you. We've already been introduced. What extracurricular club is this? -This one? -Yes. This is the Civic Education Group. We're preparing for the school's 85th Anniversary. All right, enough talking. Let's go to my office. I'll come and check on you guys later. The Aviation Club doesn't exist anymore? Hasn't been one in a while due to budget cuts. Stuff like the Civic Education Group gets funding though. 8TH INTER-SCHOOL WATER ROCKET CHAMPION: SO BOK MAN Check out how cool Bok Man was. He doesn't like to smile in front of the camera. But that guy really was a legend. You weren't too bad yourself. He's much better than I was. He scored higher than me in physics. His rockets shot higher than mine. There was only one thing that I did better than him. What was it? What was it? Class attendance. Jeez! But if we could really find him now. I have a score to settle with him. He went missing a week before the Open Day. I had to clean up his mess with the teachers. Ms. Tam Yuk Ying! What? It's Deputy Principal now. Deputy Principal Tam! Yu... Fung... Yu Fung Chi. -Correct. -Good memory! How thoughtful of you to come back and visit your teacher. And my classmate. Of course! Deputy Principal, do you still remember things back then? Of course, she does. All of us were essentially brought up by Tam Yuk Ying. I've been teaching at this school for more than 30 years. And I remember bits and pieces of it. Deputy Principal, I was wondering if you remember this guy, So Bok Man. So Bok Man. From all my years of teaching, he's the smartest in physics. Deputy Principal, my physics scores weren't bad either. -Yes. -Right. Please excuse me, I have to go check on my students. You two take your time. -All right. -I'll go take a look. Deputy Principal, has So Bok Man been in touch with you? No, he hasn't. Are you looking for him? No, we were just talking about him during a reunion. I remember that he came to me just before he quit school and told me that he wanted to become a pilot. He was considering which overseas university to attend. He was very bright. I knew then that he could do it. Sometimes, when I see planes fly across the sky, I would stop and think whether it's being piloted by So Bok Man himself. It's time. Come on. Why didn't you invite Shing Wah? Shing Wah got caught by Ms. Chan for his bold hairstyle. He's in detention right now. Boeing 747-400! How would I know if you're right? Usually, the 747 has a protruding forehead. Forehead? Right there. Those who are late, sit down right away. Opportunity knocks only once. Our special class today is about to commence. Are you crazy? This class is two hours long. Everyone has prepared in their own way. Exactly, Fifi needs to go to class as well. Keep quiet until the end of the class. -We'll take you to karaoke. -All right, students. The Open Day is less than a month away. To get everyone more involved in this event, I have chosen a few well-written Dream Planners. The first student who has been chosen is you, Tang Hao Tsing. Start reading from External Opportunities. As far as external opportunities are concerned, I believe that Hong Kong will remain as the financial center between China and the West. We'll need a lot of English speaking talents. As for environmental analysis, I think that Hong Kong will implement "One Country, Two Systems." Therefore, a sound judicial system is essential. I'm actually emigrating with my family next year. I want to major in translation at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. HKU Law Faculty. I hope to carry on my family's business. Perhaps even study abroad to expand my horizons! Hong Kong films have become increasingly vulgar nowadays. This absurdist culture is polluting our youth. My long-term goal is to become a film director. I hope that my films will not only appeal to Hong Kong citizens but also the entire Chinese population. Wait a minute, Wong Sao Ting. Your dream is to make movies? Do you need dancers in them? Give Cindy Leung a chance. Cindy Leung. If you want to dance on stage in the future, I'm not going to stop you. But you have failed two subjects in a row. Stand up and tell everyone what you wrote in your Dream Planner. Just start from Section 2A, Short-Term Goal. Everyone would like to hear it. Section 2A, Short-Term Goals. To study accounting at Hong Kong University. You're crazy. I wanted to write dancing but when I got to Interim Goals, Environmental Analyses and Market Competitiveness, I had no idea how to write it! Exactly, Mr. Luk. It was the same for me. I wanted to put down soccer player as my profession. But while I was writing this thing, and got to the Social Adjustment section and whatever Reward Assessment. I ended up writing fitness trainer as my profession. But a fitness trainer and a soccer player are two completely different things! My dream is to become Diego Maradona and lead the Hong Kong team into the World Cup! Quiet! I'm not trying to stop you from participating in extracurricular activities. But what are we talking about here? Your future! And the society's future! As your teacher, I'm concerned about all of you. That's why I'm telling you to move with the time. If you don't embrace this age, you will be abandoned, and you will be destined to fail! Yu Fung Chi. Don't think that you can get away with not handing in your work by keeping quiet. I haven't finished it yet. What's your ultimate dream then? I want to land on the moon. -The moon! -The moon! Shut up! What's going on here? Shut up, all of you! Shut up! -The moon! -The moon! Shut up! What is the matter, Sui? Yu Fung Chi. Does Mom know that you're back? I came back with your stepmom and your stepbrother. That's why it's inconvenient to see your mom. So, it's convenient to see me? What will happen to Mom if I leave? I think that your mom will agree for you to study in the UK. Think of it as insurance. Do you expect me to trust you? You've already cheated on Mom and divorced her. And then what happened? You said that you'd take care of me but then you left with my stepmom and moved to the UK. You lied to me again. I hate being lied to! It's different this time. This isn't about our family anymore. Look around you. Everybody with the means has left already. Trust the people around you. Fung Chi, where are you going? Shing Wah! Bok Man! Fung Chi! Fung Chi! Be careful. Fifi! Sorry, are you cold? Don't be afraid. Come out. Oh no, poor Fifi. Sorry. Wai Yip from 5A is moving to America. Mary is emigrating to Australia. Weng Tat and Dai Kit from the choir club are moving to Canada. Sau Lai and Lok Man are moving to New Zealand. Will you guys shut up? Stop being silly. I won't move to the UK just because my dad told me to. So you're not leaving? Who'd take care of Fifi if I left? Where would I find two dummies to hang out with? Don't be stupid. It won't fly when it's wet. Actually, I've always wanted to study abroad. As you know, Hong Kong is a tiny place. I've heard that Cornell University in the States has a great program for interior design. But that's way out of my reach. Polytechnic University then. Hong Kong Polytechnic University isn't bad at all. I quite envy the two of you actually, and also Cindy, and Maradona. All of you have a grasp of your own dreams. But I don't feel that way at all. After graduation, we'll all just become a gear within a machine. Is it really that easy to pursue our dreams? I think that your dream is... the thing that you really want to do even right before you kick the bucket. I know what my dream is now. It's to launch 10,000 paper planes! It's Gansu province, not "Gansiu." Did you proofread this? It should be "peeled." Please check your spelling and grammar. And take this work seriously. We were never this careless when we were your age. Are you checking your Facebook? Does your dad own Facebook or something? Not only did we not have Facebook. We didn't even have... the Internet. What are you looking at? Just do the corrections. What were you doing? I told you to proofread it! Hey! Hello. Don't look so down. We used to face the music all the time. We always talk about the good old days, but we all made mistakes too. -Really? -What's up? They'll only take it at 3.8 million dollars? This board of yours is quite shoddy. What else can we do? -It's all the same anyway. -It's already an improvement this year. Remember last year's "Let's Participate Civic Duties"? That was absolutely soul-sucking. Students, if you could choose any topic you want, what would you choose? Now that's no good. If you can't make up your minds once we give you the freedom, then stop complaining that the topics are boring. How about comic books? Dragon Ball? You all like Dragon Ball, right? Dragon Ball is from another generation! Even One Piece is on its 500th issue. Forget it. Stop dreaming. Let's get to work. This stuff needs to be done for the anniversary. Did you stick this on properly? It keeps falling off. This foam board doesn't seem like it's going to stick. Are you saying that I'm dreaming? Do you know what we did in the Aviation Club? It's so thin. What's going to happen next? COME AND FIND ME AT THE BACKYARD. You're channeling Shing Wah. Nonsense! "Inter-school Water Rocket Champion." I saw it in the school paper. The whole school knows. Congratulations. You asked me to come here just to hold your trophy? I'm done holding it. Here you go. It's nothing, I just wanted to... I wanted to ask you what the Aviation Club should do for the Open Day. You have so many ideas. You don't need to ask me. I'm looking for a breakthrough. Why not ask Shing Wah? He is so busy with his Rose Garden. He's not free to help me. Hey, since you like flying so much you should have a flight demonstration! Not bad. Hey. Did you hand in your Dream Planner yet? Not yet. Aren't you worried that Mr. Luk is going to flunk you? What if you can't get through to the next grade? I wanted to put down "Travel the world" but those A and B sections made me stop filling it in. Fung Chi. Let's go to England together. What I meant was, I've done some research. The University of Southampton has a great engineering program. A lot of pilots are graduates from there. I think my parents can afford my tuition fees. I'll earn my own living expenses from part-time jobs. I might even get a scholarship. Think about it, the Brits are so lazy anyway. We Hong Kongers will excel wherever we go. If I were a pilot, I would take you traveling around the world. Fung Chi. Listen to your dad and come to England with me. Hong Kong is not a place for dreamers. Fung Chi. Come fly with me. It's getting late. I need to change. Actually, I'll just change here. There's nobody around. Keep a lookout for me. How do I look? We're in a hurry, let's go! Where to? Shing Wah didn't invite you? Why didn't you invite Bok Man? What? You didn't invite Bok Man? He won't come to a place like this. How did you know that I would? You're not like him. I can tell that you're a bad girl. You never hand in your homework. You talk back to your teachers. You think you know it all, don't you! All right, I'm going to go home and be a good girl and finish that Dream Planner. Goodbye. Hey, you're really leaving? Have a drink first. Come on. Let's have a drink. One Cosmo and a Blue Moon, please. Thanks. Cheers. So, how's your Dream Planner coming along? I'm thinking of being a flight attendant. Flight attendant? As a flight attendant, I can travel around the world. But I can still travel around the world as a tour guide. What are the qualifications as a tour guide? Congratulations, you finally finished your homework. How about this? If you do end up becoming a tour guide, I, Pang Shing Wah, will be the first to sign up. Really? Don't bullshit me. I'm not bullshitting, I swear. If Yu Fung Chi successfully becomes a tour guide, I, Pang Shing Wah, will be the first to sign up for the tour. If not, I won't be named Master Handicraft. Won't be named what? Master Handicraft! Hey, So Bok Man. I'm sorry. I didn't know that you wanted to go as well. I'll invite you next time. -Why did you force Fung Chi to drink? -She wanted to drink. She has rashes all over her skin! She's allergic to alcohol! Mr. Tak. Mr. Tak. Remember me? It's Fung Chi! I used to hang out with Bok Man and Shing Wah. Fung Chi? Why aren't you wearing your school uniform? If you get caught without a school uniform, Moonhead will put you in detention. Tomorrow night, Class A has a Physical Education class. Don't forget your Physical Education kit again, and use it as an excuse to come hang out at the backyard. Mr. Tak? Yes? Have you seen So Bok Man? Bok Man, that punk. He asked me to build him a plane. I've built one, and it actually works. But he didn't end up using it. Fung Chi. If you see Bok Man, tell him to come and find me. And we'll finish that plane, do you understand? I'll try my best. Fung Chi, please help me with these. Put them back on the shelf. All right. INTER-SCHOOL WATER ROCKET CHAMPION 1992-1993 YU FUNG CHI'S BOARDING PASS BOK MAN'S AIRLINE AROUND THE WORLD TICKET If I were a pilot, I would take you traveling around the world. Why did you suddenly decide to go back to the school? At our reunion, Hing Kin said that he found an old school paper. There wasn't much work at the office, so I went back to have a look. I also wanted to check out the school paper. I didn't bring it back after I read it. There's not much to it anyway. If I didn't take some time off today, I would still be working. I thought that you said there wasn't much work at the office? Good thing you took the day off. And I managed to get a reservation here. The restaurant might not even be here the next time your schedule is free. Excuse me. How may I help you? Do you have any non-alcoholic cocktails? I'm fine, thanks. Just give me some warm water. Okay, right away. Honey. Actually-- You don't need to explain. I've forgotten about what happened last night. Just be smart about it. And delete the messages before you get home. I, Pang Shing Wah, solemnly swear that if I did whatever it is you think I did, I won't be named Master Handicraft. Master Handicraft? You're such a fool. On my first day as a tour guide, you really signed up for the three-day Shenzhen tour. Yes, I did. You were bored out of your mind. Yes, I was, from high school to middle age. Why did it suddenly come to your mind? No big deal. It was more than 20 years ago. I've just completed a big project at work. I can take a week off. The main course for tonight. Take your pick. Ignore the prices. It's just a room with a bed anyway. Might as well stay at home. Where do you want to go? I need to go to work. We haven't been on a vacation for a while. So you're available after a big project. But it's peak season for me! Your schedule is the only one that matters? Not my schedule. It's my clients' schedule. I don't get to choose when I can go on vacation. If you can't choose, can you at least let me choose? What are you talking about? Answer your call. Your office needs you. Thank you all for your hard work. We've completed Yuan Ming Palace. Let's aim higher next time. The Louvre! I want to say something. Let's all toast to Rose! Drink! -Master Handicraft! -Master Handicraft! Cool, isn't it? How is it? What are you doing? Master Handicraft? Follow me. This is the best spot. One... Two... Good morning, Mr. Luk. How's the Rose Garden coming along? Almost there. Almost there! OUR WET DREAM -Mr. Luk. -Mr. Luk. Yu Fung Chi. I'm just helping out. Okay, good. Not bad. Not bad at all. But the airplane needs to be higher. Do you want them to hit the parents? Pay attention to details, will you? You should also put some signage here. If not, how would the guests know what's going on? -Yes, sir. -You guys work so carelessly. Always so careless. You guys won't succeed that way! We have three hours to go. After three hours... You can take it as a souvenir and play with it over there. Thanks for supporting us. Hey, where is Bok Man? He's not even here on the Open Day and has left all the work to us. He has disappeared for a week. I don't know what he's doing. YING YAN STUDENT ASSOCIATION Shing Wah! Let me do it. I'm smaller. Come down from there. Hold this. Be careful. Give me the flashlight. ACTIVITY ROOM All right. OUR WET DREAM I knew you had it in you, Master Handicraft. You did Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. Hey! This is beautiful! This is crazy! This is the new airport. It's not in Kowloon City anymore. Kids of the future won't end up like stupid little Bok Man, being scared by the sound of planes. Take the water rocket. There's a button here. One, two, three! You're awesome, Bok Man. You shot down all the birds! Cindy told me to thank you on her behalf. Why thank me? For calling her crazy. Hey, did you see that director get detention from Ms. Chan? Yes, he stole the camcorder from school to edit at home. Here's the World Cup qualifying rounds, Hong Kong vs. Brazil. Maradona of Hong Kong takes the lead. Lookout! Super shot! What a shot! -Who put a smoke machine here? -What smoke? What's happening? It's okay. Everything's okay. Why did you say sorry? CONTACT ME UPLOAD DOCUMENT BOK MAN, I'M SORRY CAN WE MEET? SENT LINA: I'LL BE IN HONG KONG THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, CAN WE MEET UP? Sorry, the traffic was bad. Then, you have to drink. Waiter, can I get one more? No. Chamomile tea is fine. I said that I wouldn't drink in your presence. I just broke my promise. Your wife is a lucky woman. I hope she is. Where did we first meet each other? Are you testing me, or did you really forget? I had a drink, I can't recall. At the model shop on Changle Road. Right. We picked the remote control airplane, right? Yes, the yellow helicopter. No. The white glider. No. Your memory is really deteriorating. It was a yellow helicopter. I still have it at home. Right. We picked the same model of aircraft. So we decided to buy it together. And fly it together. Who paid in the end? I forgot. It was you. You paid. I took you to the countryside. I even asked you if it's weird for a girl to play with model airplanes. And you said that it wasn't. You also know a girl who liked airplanes. Thank you. But there's one thing I remember clearly. All right, let's hear it. A memory test. After we were done with flying the plane, we found a little bird by the field. Wrong again! It was a cat, not a bird. No, it was a white bird in a paper box. You ran towards it when you saw it. And you held up the nervous little bird. And said, "You poor little parrot!" "Did your master abandon you?" "You must be sad, being abandoned like this." "If they don't want you, I'll take you in." LET'S MEET TOMORROW AT 3 P.M. AT THE ISLAND CAFE? Are you Yu Fung Chi? Please, take a seat. I was Bok Man's girlfriend when he studied in the UK. Sorry. I was the one who created the Bok Man's World website. When I was dating Bok Man, he was always nostalgic of his past. He always told me that he had two really close friends in Hong Kong. When I saw your comments on his blog, I realized that you must be one of them. Bok Man always wanted to be a pilot. However, about ten years ago, he discovered that he had color amblyopia. So he couldn't become a pilot. After that, he talked less and less. One day, he stole a small aircraft. Bok Man... has gone to heaven. He had a box of things he always kept in his study. I think he left it for you. COME AND FIND ME AT THE RADAR PLAINS AFTER THE OPEN DAY THE YU FUNG CHI AIRCRAFT COME AND FIND ME AT THE RADAR PLAINS AFTER THE OPEN DAY If you're still in contact with the other friend, please also show him the contents of this box. Honey. Are you okay? Don't worry, I'm here. SO BOK MAN You're the coolest guy around. A lifetime honorary member of the Aviation Club. Forever 18. GRAVE OF SO BOK MAN AVIATION CLUB What are you doing, Master Handicraft? I thought that you were very forgetful. How come you are doing all these things from 20 years ago? GRAVE OF SO BOK MAN Hey, Master Handicraft. It's a lot of work, right? I found all of this stuff in Mr. Tak's backyard. Hey, don't stick it in the middle. But the center of gravity is in the middle. Don't give me that tone. I'm an alumnus of the school after all. Not bad at all. I didn't rat on you for smoking the other day. Add a little green in there. GO! I'M GOING TO FLY! Take some courage and go the distance We can almost fly away Your smile should've been gone long ago Has all the old days of ambition Been destroyed? What are the dreams Which cannot be put into words That makes me wander into the unknown? Even if I knew, I can't go back in time Take the step towards The rest of the world We still have to believe That there is imagination Hoping that time would slow down And we won't grow up All those unfinished wishes I'll yell it to the ocean for you Listen out for the echo Who could leave no scars In the days of youth? Why should we still believe That there is hope? I wish that I could spread my wings Like a bird Hugging the wind during my journey Where can I find the light of daybreak? Going forward together hand in hand, While we're young We can't let go of the good times ahead From today, we make a promise to our goals For the betterment of the world We'll give our all We still have to believe That there is imagination Hoping that time would slow down And we won't grow up All those unfinished wishes, I'll yell it to the ocean for you Listen out for the echo Who could leave no scars In the days of youth? Going forward together hand in hand, While we're young We can't let go of the good times ahead From today, we make a promise to our goals For the betterment of the world We'll give our all
