Help! Help! Oh, welcome, welcome. Let me know if you need anything. Oh my God. Why is this so heavy? It's just a couch. It's heavy because it's real furniture, babe. It's not that online, do-it-yourself garbage. Thank you for helping. I know this has been such a pain. Oh, come on, you know I got you, but I do think we should take a break. No, not until I finish unpacking the kitchen. No, no, no, no. I think you need a break. And I know exactly how to recharge your batteries. Come on. - Mmm. - Oh. What? Oh, no. Later. We're busy. Very busy. Uh, it might be work. Oh, babe. Really? - I'm sorry. - But I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hi, Mrs. Linenberger. Yeah, my classes are going great. Just moved in to my new apartment. How is it? - It's... - Pocket-sized. Very efficient. It's the perfect study space for a med student. How's everything with the twins? I cannot wait to start work on Monday. I promise, I'm gonna be there bright and... Oh. Oh, you're getting transferred. That soon. That's great news. No. No, no, no, no. I'll be fine. I just wish I could say bye to the girls before you move. Yeah, yeah, no. Another time. Thanks. Okay, bye. Everything okay? I can loan you some money till you find something else. Babe, I just got that promotion down at the bank. I do all the credit checks on the new employees we hire. Is that as thrilling as it sounds? I mean... nah. Not at all. This is why I hang around you. All the thrill I need. Don't worry, babe, you'll definitely find another family to work for, even better than the twins. Hi, I'm just busy in the kitchen. - Come on in. - Mm-hm. Baking up a storm here. This looks tasty. Say what it really looks like: a disaster. Would you hand me that bowl, please? - Yeah. - Thank you. Oh, here's my first rent check. Oh, and I didn't even have to ask for it. I knew you'd be a good tenant. Did you get moved in okay? Yeah, it was great. How are you doing? You look like you need some help. Ugh, I just need to have my head examined for taking on too much all at once yet again. I have to get these cakes over to the church by 1:00. I never should have volunteered to be on the Birthday Committee. You know, every time I do something nice like this, it just turns around and bites me in the butt. Oh! Do you know anyone at the church who needs a babysitter or a part-time nanny? I need a job, and fast. I thought you were busy with the Linenberger twins. I was, but Mrs. Linenberger got a job transfer and they moved this weekend. It was perfect because I could only work part-time, and most families need a full-time nanny. I just... I can't do that with school. Well, I might have a temp job for you today looking after this little rascal. What little rascal? The same little rascal that keeps eating all my frosting. Danny? Danny! It's never a good thing when he's this quiet. Means he's up to no good. Did he get outside? Danny? Danny. Danny? Danny. Danny, you know I don't like these hide-and-seek games you always play, now show yourself. Is Danny your grandson? I wish I were so lucky. No, his parents are friends of mine from church. Danny, I am not joking. Now where are you? Gotcha! Hoo-hoo. Scared you good this time. Mm-hm. Danny, you know you're not supposed to sneak off like that. What would your mother say? She would say scaring people isn't a game. I'm sorry, Mrs. Tubbs. Oh, you know I can't stay mad at you, you little stinkbug. Wow, those are cool shoes. Do they light up when you walk? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. Oh, this isn't a stranger. This is Delondra. She's gonna look after you while I finish baking. Is that okay with you, Danny? Depends. Do you like snakes? I don't like snakes. I love them. Me too. Catch this. Ah! Oh! Think fast. Oh, there's a park down the street I've been dying to check out. Do you wanna go? If that's okay with you. Oh, please. Let him run off some of that energy. The boy is like a nuclear reactor. He never runs out. Tag, bet you can't catch me. Oh, I bet I can. Hey, why do you like kids so much? Don't you have friends your own age? Yes, but sometimes I think kids are more fun to be around than adults. I don't want to grow up. Why not? Because adults worry too much, and they always frown, like my dad. Why does your dad frown so much? Hi. Hey. Come on, Danny. Come here. Hey. No. Let go of him! Don't come any closer. What, Mom? We were just playing! Are you okay? Did she hurt you? - No! - You're his mother. Yes, I'm his mother. Melody, no! It's okay. This is the babysitter. Yeah, Mom, don't get mad. She's nice and she likes snakes too. You should have called and asked my permission. You know how I feel about strangers watching Danny. Oh, she's not a stranger. This is my new tenant. She moved into the attic apartment after Lonnie took off for Alaska. You must think I'm a terror. No, no, I think you're a good mother. I probably would have reacted the same way. I'm Delondra Caprez. Melody. Melody Chessman. You have a great son. I've watched a lot of kids, and I can tell the ones who have good parents. Come on, let's make this truce official over some tea or coffee. Come on, kiddo. I'm so sorry I lashed out at you at the park earlier. Stop, it's forgiven and forgotten. Well, there is a reason that I reacted so angrily. It's okay, you can tell Delondra. She's good people. What happened? Seven years ago, Danny was kidnapped. He was only a couple of months old, and he was gone for a week before the police found him. Kidnapped? How? The babysitter took him to the park, and she was attacked. Some terrible monster just yanked him out of his baby carriage. I'm still surprised that we got him back. They found him at the fire station. I guess the kidnappers decided that a baby was just too much trouble, and they decided to give him up. Danny still doesn't know what happened to him as a baby. And it's going to stay that way. I want him to grow up feeling as normal as possible and feeling safe. They never found who took him that day. So when I saw you with him at the park, someone I don't know... You thought I could have been the one who kidnapped him. It's ridiculous, I know. But I still will check on him at least twice every night while he's sleeping just to make sure he's still there. You can trust Delondra. She'll keep him safe. She's a professional. A professional? At what? I'm a nanny. I've been doing it on and off for the past couple of years while I finish med school. Mm, that's very impressive. And Delondra is currently available, so what do you say? Are you looking for a nanny? Well, my husband and I have talked about it. He's been really sick, and I'm busy at work. If it wasn't for Mrs. Tubbs, we would be lost. That boy is wearing me out. You're not gonna find a nanny better than Delondra. And Danny obviously adores her. I don't know, it's a big commitment. I really need to talk to my husband. Oh, I'll handle Joel. But if it's not Delondra, it's gotta be someone. You need help taking care of Danny while you're at work, and I just can't keep up with him anymore. Wait, so was today a job interview? Mm. In a way. Well, when can you start? Right now. I... I just... I can only do part-time while I'm in school. I'm studying pediatrics. Could she be any more perfect? But don't rush making your decision. And I can talk to your husband too. I just... I do need to find a job rather quickly. No, you don't. You have one if you want it. - For real? - For real. - Hi! - Oh, there he is. Oh, geez! I missed you. Delondra, this is my husband, Joel. - Hi. - Hey, Delondra. Welcome to the family. I hope this little guy hasn't been too much trouble for ya. Only the good kind. Danny. This is wonderful. Do you mind if I share this with my friends? No. Let's do it. One, two, three. Now everyone will see what a good artist you are. I will not wear your real diamonds. They're knockoffs. Seriously. Please take them. You're like the younger sister I never had. I always wanted a big sister. Looks like we both got our wish. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Bye, buddy. - Bye. See you. - Bye, Mrs. Tubbs. Bye, honey. I knew she was the right choice. I never thought that I would be comfortable with anyone who wasn't one of us watching him. But she's special. Yeah, it's been really nice not having to worry about him all the time. We can focus on work, our home, our life. My health is already improving. Yeah, it's like we can finally exhale. You know how long it's been since I've been able to do that? About seven years. I'm sorry I doubted you. How can I thank you? As long as y'all are happy, that's all the thanks I need. What do you want to do first? This. Gonna have fun with this. Careful, okay? I will. This is amazing. I love the stuff that's over here. It's a beautiful day. Hey, uh, will we still be friends when I'm older and I don't need a nanny anymore? Yeah, you got me for life, buddy. Pinky swear? Pinky swear. I'll never stop being there for you and keeping you safe, okay? That's a promise. And now can we play hide-and-seek again? Again? Yes, again. And I wanna hide first and you count down from 15. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna start counting. 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come. Where are you? Okay, you're too good at this. You win the hiding prize. Come on out. Danny? Danny? Danny? Danny? Oh, look, I made a new friend. I've been calling after you. Why haven't you answered? Come on, get off the swing. But I'm still playing. Danny. Right now. Thanks so much for keeping him safe until I got here. I'm Delondra. I'm so sorry, but we can't stay and play. We gotta go home. Let go of me, you're hurting me. As I lay down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Night, Danny. Sweet dreams. Danny? Do you need some water, buddy? Danny, did you do this? What are you doing here? Did you follow me? You're gonna have to kill me before you hurt that little boy. The little boy? Delondra, we're back. Wait, wait, wait, she might hurt you. - Who? - Her! She must have gotten away. Who? A woman from the park earlier. I think she followed Danny and I home. God, Danny. Danny's fine. He's sound asleep. So you noticed any recognizable tattoos, birthmarks, moles, or anything like that? Um, she had a strong smell. Like she hadn't showered recently. Hm. And you said the first time you saw her was today at the park? She's probably a vagrant. She followed you home hoping to find some quick cash, which explains why she broke into the home office. So you're saying she could come back at any point? Not likely. The homeless, they're not career criminals and they scare easily. Well, do you have enough information to catch her? We'll try. As you know, a lot of break-ins have been happening lately. We'll keep our eyes open, but you guys should do the same. Well, thank you. Yeah. - We appreciate it. - Yeah. Melody, let me help you with that. You're shaking. Of course I'm shaking. You were almost beaten up, and Danny... Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. No, it won't. She'll come back. The police are gonna handle it. What, like they did the first time Danny was kidnapped? If Delondra hadn't been here, then that maniac could have made off with our son again. Look, Melody, we have no idea if she's the one who took Danny seven years ago. Yes, she is. Who else would it be? How's Danny? He's fine, he slept right through it. Oh, thank God. She thinks it was the kidnapper. That's impossible. Why? They never caught who took him before. God, I can't go through this again. And you're not. Listen, why don't we just go to bed. - In the morning... - You are not suggesting that we spend another night here. I will not stay here another day and wait for that lady to come back and take our son. We can't keep moving, okay? This constant relocating is not healthy for us. It's not healthy for our son. No, I can't sleep here. I won't. Pack up a few things. You're staying with me tonight. And then tomorrow, when you all have cooler heads, we'll figure out next steps. - Yeah. - Okay. I'll help you pack Danny's things. Oh, no, we got it. You relax. You've been through enough tonight. Can I make you something warm to drink? Cocoa always makes me feel better in times of stress. You're so good to the Chessmans. Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be? I can't remember whether you have a queen or a king-size bed in the guest room. Which linens should I bring? Oh, don't worry about that. I have plenty of linens at home. You know what? Maybe this was just a one-off incident, - terrible but... - No. It was the original kidnapper. I know it in my heart. I just don't understand how she would find us. We intentionally move every two years just so something like this won't happen. And we don't post anything on social media, so how in the world would she find us? Delondra, is something wrong? I posted a photo of Danny. What photo? A photo I posted on social media. - Danny and I. - Are you kidding me? What photo are we talking about? Who gave you permission to post photos of my son? He's not some toy for you to use. This is your fault. You're why she found us. I didn't think that... Yeah, you didn't think, just like I didn't think when I hired some stupid med student to take care of my little boy. Melody, that isn't necessary. You knew how scared I was to trust you and how afraid I was that something like this was gonna happen. I thought you were my friend. I am your friend. I'm sorry. Look, it's deleted. And I will never post anything about Danny again. That's right, because you're never gonna see my son again. - You're fired. - Melody! You don't mean that. Because of her, a kidnapper broke into my home and stole the happiness and security that I've spent the last seven years trying to regain. I'll go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down. I'm sorry. I blurred the lines. But they didn't feel like another nanny job. Melody, Joel, Danny. Really felt like family. I blew it. I'll get it. No, it's okay, I got it. Hi, I just wanted to stop by and say... Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back. Oh, no, it's all good. I actually was just about to leave. I'll see you tonight for dinner, babe. So sorry about what happened, but I know the police are gonna find her. Our city's got a good force. Thank you. Wow. You've made this place really cozy. I remember when this attic was just a storage space. Oh, I didn't realize you've known Mrs. Tubbs for that long. Yes, there was a time whenever she was the only person that I could count on. And then you came into our lives. Melody, I cannot tell you enough how sorry I am about that photo. Well, then let me tell you. I was out of line yesterday. No, you weren't. Will you let me finish my apology? I just get so scared that someone's gonna come and take Danny again, that I just can't think. And sometimes I say the worst things to the people that I care about the most. It's not much, but I wanted to make it up to you. No, you didn't have to do this. - That's too much. - Oh, it's nothing. It's just some of your favorite cosmetics and a few other guilty pleasures. - Still friends? - Of course. And most importantly, will you still be Danny's nanny? Yes. Great. Have the police made any headway yet? Shh, not in front of Danny. None of us are safe as long as that woman is still out there, and I am not waiting around for the cops to get their act together. Are you leaving? Mrs. Tubbs offered us the use of her cabin. It's five hours up in the mountains. It's the only way for me to keep Danny safe. And you too. You want me to come with you? Well, you are still our nanny. And you don't go back to school until the fall, right? Yeah. I mean, I would feel safer being away until the cops catch that woman. And we would feel safer having you with us. Danny doesn't need any more disruptions. You're one of his new constants. Okay, you got a deal. But I gotta be honest, I am not that great at the whole camping, outdoors thing. Well, neither am I, and neither is Mrs. Tubbs, which is why her cabin is equipped with TV, internet, and a hot tub. Ooh, are we staying at a cabin or a spa? Well, after all we've been through, we all deserve a little bit of luxury, but most of all peace of mind. Yeah. Wait, what do you mean you don't know the address to where you'll be staying? How am I supposed to know where to send my love letters to, babe? Please! You never sent me a love letter the whole time we've been together. - What? - I'm lucky if I get a text back. All I get is "Sup" and "K." I mean... It's just because I prefer to express my feelings to you in person. No, but seriously, babe, you sure you're gonna be okay alone in the woods? I'm not gonna be alone, I'm gonna be with the Chessmans. Besides, Danny will keep me busy enough. Are you sure you're gonna be okay here alone? I actually fly out for that finance conference up in San Francisco tomorrow. I was kinda hoping you might come with me, turn into a little mini vacay. I wish, but the Chessmans need me. I mean, it's taken a lot for them to trust me with Danny. I don't want to let them down. Tell me something. Do all nannies take their jobs as seriously as you do? Only the good ones. I would invite you in, but we're leaving super early tomorrow. Nah, it's all good. I understand. But, hey, I guess I just better go ahead and give you this now then. What? Open it. For any close encounters with wildlife you might have up there. Stop. Baby, what's that? Rob! The last thing I need is a bear encounter. If Goldilocks can hold her own up there in the woods, so can you. Thanks. All right, come on. Give me my good night kiss. All right, be safe. - I will. - Good night. Good night. I don't wanna hurt you. Where is he? Where is the little boy? Will you tell me? Please don't hurt me. I just wanna talk. About Danny? Danny? D-Danny? Hey! No! Hey, let me out! No, please. Let me out! 9-1-1, what's your emergency? There's a woman. She's in my apartment. You sure you're all right and you don't have to go the hospital to get checked out? No, she didn't hurt me. Scared the heck out of me, but I'll recover. We're gonna keep her booked overnight. Then we're gonna transfer her to a facility across state where she can't hurt you or anyone in this community again. - Who is she? - Who knows? She didn't have any ID. Logistics is gonna run a fingerprint scan, see if she's been booked for anything before. Like kidnapping? - Delondra. - No, let her ask. It's just nice to hear that someone else is just as suspicious of this woman as I am. She kept asking where the little boy was. Sorry, we're short-staffed. Got to cover a bust at the mall. We'll continue this conversation later. Whoever this woman is, we will find out. She can't hurt you again. I know we're staying in a cabin, but I thought it might be fun to camp a little. Here, there you go. Oh, I'm so clumsy. Don't worry. Nothing broke. Melody, you're trembling. I can't stop thinking about that horrible woman and what might have happened if she had... Honey, nobody got hurt, okay? More importantly, Danny didn't get hurt. Morning, Mrs. Chessman. Mr. Chessman. Morning, Officer. Didn't expect to see you so soon. Yeah, I was in the area. Just want to give you a little update. Going on a trip? Yeah, just a little vacation. You know, with everything that's happened, the family can use a change in scenery. Hm. I love camping. Know a few good spots. Uh, where ya headed? Uh, why are you here? Is this about that woman? I got some good news depending on how you look at it. Fingerprint check confirmed that the woman who's disturbing you is Karla Wichael. And turns out you're not the first family she's threatened like this. So, this isn't a random thing? I can't disclose too much, but she's been arrested in several states over the past few years, in Indiana, Ohio, Texas, all under some misguided belief that someone took her child and she wants him back, which explains her obsession with seeing Danny at the park and why she followed him back here. Wait, so could this be the person who originally kidnapped Danny? Mrs. Tubbs says cupcakes are just like muffins but only fancier. Did you have cupcakes for breakfast? Wow, are you a real cop? You must be Danny. Are you here to arrest us? Oh. Of course not. I'm here to help. That's what police officers do. Officer, maybe we could talk more privately, away from little ears. Of course. Have a good trip, kiddo. Yeah, come on, let's get you loaded in the car, - get ready for our big trip. - But I want to play with the cop and pretend I'm a robber. Danny, mind your nanny and get in the car with her right now. Come on. Melody, this tension is gonna give you a nervous breakdown. You have to learn to calm down. I wish you were going with us. It's your cabin after all. Oh, I've got too much to do here. And my church would be lost without me. Besides, I should stay here and keep an eye on things, just in case. Just in case what? God, I don't know how much more of this I can take. A summer away from this nonsense will do your heart good. And it's just for a summer, right? For now. You can't keep running and you can't keep being so scared all the time. It's not good for Danny. I know. Delondra, I asked you a question. Sorry, buddy. What is it? Will you play games on my tablet with me? You're gonna share your tablet with me? What a privilege. No, it's because I love you. I love you, too, sweet guy. - You guys ready? - Yeah. Well? Oh, he just, uh, he just wanted information on the other detectives working on Danny's case, you know, that way he can update them on this Karla woman. Mommy, don't be sad. Oh, how can I be sad when I'm with you? I love you, big guy. Don't ever forget that, okay? Okay. Hey... Road trips are supposed to be fun. Let's have some fun, okay? Okay. - Melody? - Okay. Louder, Mommy. Okay. I still can't hear you. Okay! Do you care for some coffee, Detective? Oh, no. Just gonna get going. Have a nice day. Wow, this is just like Robin Hood! Hey, Dad, can we catch our own food? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure they have chicken fingers in the wild you can catch. Yes! This was the right decision. You can relax. It's okay to exhale. - Okay. - Hey, I can get the bags. You guys go inside and get settled. Are you sure? It's a lot. Go on. Hello? Is someone there? - Can I help you? - No, but can I help you? Oh my God. You scared me. Weren't you talking to me? No, I was... I don't know who I was talking to. Well, now you're talking to Babs Bennett, and this is my father. Welcome to the mountain. We own the cottage down by the old mill. You should come by sometime. Bring your boy. Oh, no, I'm just the nanny. I'm here helping the family while they're on vacation. Summer vacation. How fun. Well, I won't keep you from getting settled in. - Come by anytime... - Delondra. Nice to meet you, Delondra. Delondra! Delondra! You won't believe what they have in the house. Deer heads! Do you think they can talk to us? I don't know, let's find out. Ooh, it's all so musty. When's the last time Mrs. Tubbs was here? Uh, I think it's been about two years. She's not even rented it to anybody either. Oh, I met a nice family. They live down by the old watermill. I was thinking I could take Danny there for lunch tomorrow. I don't think it's a good idea for us to be socializing with anyone while we're up here. I mean, we're gonna be here all summer. It's not like we can avoid them. Well, we came here to find privacy, not have it invaded. Are we not enough to keep you company? Oh my God, look at the wildflowers. Oh, I think I'm gonna go pick a bouquet. Yeah, pick two or three. This place could use some flowers to brighten it up. Why don't you come with me? - It's so beautiful outside. - No. Danny's taking a nap, and this is a new place, so I don't want him to be afraid if he can't find me when he wakes up. Okay. Everything okay? I'm not so sure that bringing Delondra here was the best idea. I'm just scared. Stop. We learned long ago never to make decisions based in fear again. All right, this summer is gonna give us time to figure out what to do. When will it end, Joel? What? This feeling that everything we have will be taken away. Ah! Ow. I won't hurt you. My name is Caleb Jantz. I just want to talk with you. Are we clear? I promise. I don't want to hurt you. I don't have any money. I don't want your money. What do you want? Are you related to that couple in the cabin? Sister? Cousin? - Answer me. - I'm the nanny to their little boy. He's not their little boy. What are you talking about? Of course he's... That little boy was kidnapped seven years ago. How did you know he was kidnapped? Wait, you mean... they actually told you they kidnapped him? They? They didn't kidnap him, they're his parents. Aren't they? They're only pretending to be. I suspect that couple you're working for aren't that little boy's parents, but are the people who kidnapped him seven years ago. And you're the only one who can help me get him back to the family he really belongs with. Oh, Danny wore me out. Besides, he says Delondra is the only one cool enough to play fortress with him the right way. Where is she? She's still out picking flowers, but she has been gone for quite a while. All right, I'll go track her down. No, you rest. I will go. And while she is playing with Danny, you and I can sneak off and play with each other. Who do you think you are making accusations about people you don't even know? I know they're not who they're pretending to be. And why should I believe you? You assault me in the woods and you expect me to take you at your word? I'm sorry I grabbed you. I didn't know how else to make sure you would listen to me. If you don't believe me, I won't bother you anymore. No, you must have the Chessmans mistaken with another family. Another family with a little boy who was coincidentally also kidnapped seven years ago? What does that have to do with you? My nephew was kidnapped seven years ago when he was an infant. Our family has been a wreck ever since Aspen was taken away from us. - Aspen? - Yeah. That's my nephew's name. Well, see? Then it can't be the Chessmans. Their son's name is Danny. Because they changed his name. He was an infant when he was taken, so he wouldn't know the difference. No, you don't understand how much they love him, the lengths that they go to to make sure that he's never kidnapped or in danger again. You mean the lengths they'll go to make sure they're not caught? You suspect I could be right. Just a little. I see it in your eyes. Why should I believe you? Because I have proof. Back at my Jeep. It's parked down the hill. I promise, I won't hurt you. Yeah. You can say that again. I can see why they hired you to be the nanny. Follow me. How do I know I can trust you? Because if you love that little boy the way I think you do, you owe it to him to set things right. Delondra? Are you out there? Delondra! Go ahead, take a look. No. If you want me to see something, show me. I'm not putting my knife down. That's the woman who was stalking me back home. How do you know her? Karla is my sister. This is the last photo we have of my nephew before he was kidnapped. Is she up here with you, too? No, no, she's still in jail. They won't believe a word she said. She's had these kinds of encounters with families she thought took her son before. She had a nervous breakdown after he was kidnapped. When she doesn't take her medicine like... So, she's accused other families of kidnapping her son before? - Yes. - So she has to be mistaken about the Chessmans. Look, I'm really sorry about your family's misfortune, but that doesn't mean you can come up here and just... I'm not finished. I told you. I have proof. When the police pretty much gave up trying to find my nephew, I hired a sketch artist to draw what he might look like today. You know... I'm telling the truth. Don't you? You know that little boy you're taking care of is my nephew. If your sister really is his real mother, then why didn't she just tell me instead of acting like a crazy person? She broke into my home. Because she's not on her medicine. When Aspen disappeared, her mind cracked right open. Getting him back has become an obsession. We all tried to convince her it was a lost cause, but when she called me from jail and begged me to find out if what she suspected was true... Why are you coming to me? I'm just a nanny. I'm not a police officer. The police won't help us anymore. My sister has wrongly accused so many people over the years, they won't take my word or hers seriously anymore. We need proof that little boy... What kind of proof do you need? - DNA evidence. - Please. It's the only way to know if that little boy really is my nephew, Aspen. Once I have that proof, then the police will have to take my claim seriously. What am I supposed to do? Take a sample of his blood? No, just some of his hair. You've really thought this through. I promise I won't make you do anything else. I'll even pay you. Just a few strands of hair for the lab to compare with his baby hair and see if it's a match. There has to be somebody else who can do this. If the DNA isn't a match, then I'll know it's not him. But if there's a chance... I'll make a compromise. I'll call the police and I'll leave an anonymous tip, and then Child Protective Services will be legally required to investigate. That... that could take weeks. If the Chessmans suspect anyone is on to them, they will flee and I may never have another chance to find him again. Please, give me some of his hair. I'm sorry, it's just too much to ask. You're the only one who can do this. You owe it to that little boy to give him back to his proper family. There has to be another way. Delondra? Am I interrupting something? No. Yes, but, um... I was, uh, just asking her for directions to the best place to fish. Haven't had any luck out here. Yeah, I told him he was wasting his time because I've never been here before. Uh, perhaps you know a good spot. I don't fish. None of us do. Found your basket. Oh, great. I was scared I lost it. Good luck with your fishing. I'll, uh, be out here all night if you change your mind and want to join me. Nice meeting you. You sure you're okay? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Everything's fine. I hope these stems aren't too broken. Can't make a bouquet without any flowers. So, uh, what was going on back there? I'm on to you. Oh, it's... It's not like that. Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell. He was cute, I don't blame you for flirting. I'm not gonna tell Rob. That is what you were doing, right? Guilty. Oh, to be young and single again. Look, it can't be a coincidence. And you should've seen the drawing, Rob. I'm still not sure I believe any of this myself, but the drawing that the artist made looks just like Danny. Hello? Melody? Joel? Delondra, if all of this is true, I don't want you staying there. I don't know if any of it's true, which is why I need your help. Can you see what you can find out? I can't get on my computer here. I can leave San Francisco tonight and come and get you first thing in the morning. No, no. All of this could be nothing. I know it sounds unbelievable. But it could also be very possible. Babe, I got a bad feeling about all of this. I can't go to the police with just feelings. Only proof. So, see what you can find out and call me back, okay? How am I supposed to know you'll be safe? Well, you gave me a good luck charm in case of wildlife emergencies, remember? Delondra, I love you. Babe, please be safe. I will. I love you, too. Boo! Danny. You're a little three-foot-tall bogeyman, you know that? Uh, where's your mom and dad? I don't know. Let's play a game. Um, yeah. First, let me brush your hair. It's a mess. Come on. Delondra? Is that you? Who's there? Caleb? Caleb? I did what you asked. Oh, Rob. Did you find out anything? I couldn't find anything online, so I did a credit check through my work database on Joel and Melody Chessman, but it turns out I don't even think that's their real name. Get this, babe, they changed their name three times over the past seven years. You're kidding. What are their real names? George and Carol Probasco. And they do have a little boy named Danny. Well, at least they did. Records show he died in some type of household accident seven years ago. So it's true. Danny isn't theirs. They really are the kidnappers. Get out of there now. - No, not without him. - What do you mean? You think these maniacs are just gonna let you walk up and take the little boy? No. I have to get him away from them tonight. This could be his last chance to be with his true family. If I disappear, then they'll know that I'm on to them and they'll run away again and they'll take him with them, and who knows when anyone will have a chance to save that little boy? Call the police. That's what they're there for. I'll call the police as soon as I get Danny away from Melody and Joel. The only way that I know he'll be safe is if he's with me. You are just the nanny. That little boy is not your responsibility. Yes, he is. I made a promise. People break promises all the time. Not me. Not to him. I'll call you as soon as I have Danny, okay? Del... Is someone there? Caleb? Is someone there? Caleb? - Oh! - Oh, Delondra. What are you doing out here so late? I thought I was the only night owl in the woods. - You look scared to death. - Um, you said you live right down the road, right? - By the old watermill? - Yeah, yeah, you can come visit me and my dad anytime. Can I come there tonight? Tonight? But it's already so late. Yeah, I might need your help with something. I just can't tell you what it is yet. Can I trust you? Of course you can. Is there anything I can do to help you now? No. Thank you, though. Have fun with your new boyfriend? I see you've been talking to your wife. Well, is there any truth to it? I hear he's been making quite the impression on you. I just wanted to go for a walk before bed. Got darker faster than I thought it would. - Night. - You know, Melody said your new friend's been making up stories about us. He didn't say anything about you. You wouldn't lie to me now, would you? Of course not, Mr. Chessman. Just as I know you would never lie to me. We can trust each other. Of course. Yeah. Uh, get some sleep. Yeah, I know Danny wants to wake up early and make pancakes, so... See you in the morning. Does she know? I mean, if she did, why would she come back to the cabin? True. But I don't want to take any chances. I think I may take a hike tomorrow with just Delondra. Melody, she doesn't know. Otherwise, she'd have the police here by now. Okay, so I want to make sure it stays that way. Don't worry, you won't have to be involved. I'll take care of all the messy little details just like I always do. Danny. Wake up. Shh, we're gonna play a secret game. Okay? Just you and me. All you have to do is be quiet, not make a sound, and then you win all the ice cream you want. What game is this? It's called the Monster Game. We have to be as quiet as we can so we don't wake the monsters up and they catch us. Can you do that? Okay. Okay. Put your jacket on. Hop on my back. Remember, don't make a sound, okay? Okay. All right, on the count of three, we're gonna run really fast, but we have to be quiet, okay? One, two, three, come on. Come on, buddy. Come on. Yes? What can I do for ya? I'm really sorry to bother you, but, um, can you let us in, please? We need your help. Delondra, it's the middle of the night. What is going on? I'll explain everything. Please, can you just let us in? Did I win the game? Can I have my ice cream now? I promise first thing in the morning you can have an ice cream cone for breakfast. Can you take Danny back to a bedroom? I need to talk to you two privately. I don't want to go to their room. I want to go back home, to my bed. Please, just listen, okay? Be a good boy? Just take him somewhere comfortable and quiet? Hey, did you know I have a room filled with teddy bears? Want to see? Sure. Suits me. You're scaring us. What's going on? Follow me. I know this sounds like something out of one of those true-crime shows, kidnappings and fake names. What are their real names again? George and Carol Probasco. My boyfriend, he works at a financial services company and he found that out when he did a credit check on them. They really did have a son named Danny, but he died seven years ago. And then Caleb Jantz showed me a photo of his nephew, or at least what his nephew would look like today, and the boy looked exactly like Danny. I mean, it was eerie. I was gonna meet with him tonight and that's when I ran into you. I don't want to believe the worst about the Chessmans or the Probascos, whoever they are, but everything that I've learned brings me to the same conclusion: the boy I've been nannying for the past few months isn't being raised by his parents, but by the people who kidnapped him. It's like they're using him as a replacement for their dead son. Certainly seems that way. I didn't think you would believe me. I believe in maniacs and that this world gets more twisted every day. I mean, to look at them, you would never think that they would do something like this. They're so nice. Delondra, could you give me and Babs a minute to discuss this? Shh. Everything's gonna be okay. You'll be home soon, okay? Your real home. Oh, I must've fallen asleep. Daddy! We'll handle this quietly, Delondra, don't make a scene. And if you keep making accusations about us kidnapping our own son and using fake names, then we're gonna be forced to press charges. You don't want that, do you? Get up and put on your shoes. You should go, Delondra. Yes, let's go, so you can get your things and you can go back to where you belong. I've already told Mrs. Tubbs to be expecting you. Did we win the game, Delondra? Did we get away from the monsters? No, Danny, we didn't. Look, I can understand you wanting to find out who took Danny, but to accuse me and Joel? I thought of you like my sister, Delondra, and I thought that you saw me the same way. Then why did you change your names? Rob did a credit check... Which is illegal. Your boyfriend obviously has us confused with someone else, and I will make sure that he never works in the financial sector again. No, don't bring Rob into this, okay? He only checked because I asked him to. But why? Why would you think that we could do something so vicious as to kidnap our own son? Caleb showed me photos... Who's Caleb? The man I was with. The man you saw me in the woods with the other day. He has a nephew that was kidnapped seven years ago... No, no, Delondra, stop it! Maybe I got... carried away. I believed the wrong person. You obviously did. Just take your stuff and get out of here. Joel will take you back. Um... where's my phone? I don't know. What, are you accusing me of taking that too? You know, you really are messed up in the head, Delondra. No! I want Delondra to stay! - Danny! Danny, come here! - Please! I told you to wait in your room until Delondra leaves. Come on, Danny, let's go outside and see if we can find some bunnies. No, I want Delondra to stay. Look, Danny, I wish I could, okay, but I made a mistake. - Now I have to go. - What kind of mistake? Was it because of that game last night? Did I not do a good job playing? - Danny, let go of... - No! - Help me. - No, no, leave me alone! - Calm down! - Leave me alone! - Danny, quiet! - Leave me alone! Let me stay! - Danny, quiet! - Let me go! Leave me alone! Just calm down. It's gonna be okay, Danny, just calm down. Why did you have to be so curious? Why did you have to know? Grab her, Joel. Oh, this is gonna be nice and quick. Just a few swallows and you'll never have to think about your worries again. You brought this on yourself! No, no! Enough! Joel? Come on, now. You know we have to do this. Oh, don't you go get weak on me now. Man up! Killing her is not gonna change the fact that... It is over, Melody. Oh, no, don't do this to me. We knew it was over the minute his mother found where we live. But she can't prove anything. You saw her, she's out of her mind! Violent. They think that she's crazy. But they'll investigate. Especially if Delondra goes missing, they're gonna search for her, they're gonna find something. No, no, they won't, because we'll just run away, and we'll start over like we always do. We can't keep running, Melody. I mean, it was easy when Danny was little, but he's older now, he... he's smarter, he's gonna figure it out. His teacher, his teacher's gonna find out, one of his friends at school. This is why we home-school him, so that we can control who he's around at all times. It's a lost cause, Melody. Joel, don't give up on our family. Aren't you tired? How many more people do we need to kill before we feel safe? I can't do it anymore. I'm too exhausted. There's nothing wrong with... protecting our family, and... and making sure that our son is safe. He's not our son. Yes, he is! Our son is dead! Face it. That little boy does not belong to us. It's over, Melody. I'm done. No, no. Are you saying that you want us to turn ourselves in? Oh no, this is all my fault. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have put you through so much. Joel, stop crying and look at me. I need you to tell me if this is what you really want, because once we go to the police, that's it, that's it. It's better than waking up terrified every day that we're gonna get caught. That's no way to live. And that is no way to raise a child. Where did she go? Don't worry. I won't make you do anything that you don't want to do ever again. I love you. Hey, don't worry, okay? We're gonna be fine, just hold onto me, okay? Danny? Danny? No! Watch your head, okay? Delondra, where are we going? Um... I just have to remember which way to Caleb's Jeep. Think, Delondra. Um... Okay, let's go this way. Come on. Come on. Are you okay? Delondra, your face. I'm fine. Come on, let's keep going. Okay, watch your head. Okay. Got it? Come on, come on! Give me my boy! - Mommy? - Give me my son! Come on, come on! Danny, Danny! - Mom! - Danny, come on, baby! Just stay down. Come on, come on! Delondra, it's a manual, just like Mrs. Tubbs' truck. Yes! Danny! Dan...! Danny... Danny, are you okay? My parents did bad things, didn't they? I overheard you talking. Yeah. I'm sorry. It's okay. It is? At least I know that you're still good because you always kept that promise of keeping me safe. Let me see your lip. You want some more aspirin? No, I think I'm pain-relieved out. I just hope Danny's okay. I think he's still back there with the social worker, but I'm just concerned about you right now. I'm fine. I'm terrible, I don't... I don't know what I am, I just... I hope I did the right thing. Are you kidding me? You helped that little boy escape from those terrible people. Of course you did the right thing. Terrible people that he thought were his parents. How is he ever gonna recover from this? Excuse me... Delondra Caprez? I'm Todd Wichael, Aspen's father. Aspen? Oh, you mean Danny. And this is my wife, Karla. Yeah, we met. I'm so sorry about my behavior. I wasn't on my medicine. No, don't apologize. I can't imagine what losing a child like that would do to somebody. I don't think I could handle it. Our nightmare is over because of you. I can't begin to thank you enough for bringing our son back to us. No, I'm nothing. I think anybody would've done the same thing. No, not anybody would've just... Oh my God. This is Todd and Karla Wichael. They're the couple I was telling you about. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. No, buddy, we're not strangers. We're your parents. We're your real parents. I'm your mommy! And this is your daddy! We've come to take you home. What's going on, Delondra? I know this is confusing, but you weren't raised by your real parents. Um, so now you're gonna go home, to your real home. I don't wanna go home with them, I don't know those people. But I know you, Delondra. Take me home. I'm sorry, I can't. You have to go be with your family. I'll be good, I won't take up much room, I'll do everything you ask, just please, Delondra. Is there any way that he could stay with me, like, an adjustment period or something? He's just a kid. Trust me, it's better this way. Oh, Delondra! You poor thing. Oh, does that hurt? Oh, I hope it doesn't leave a scar. You know, I've got some vitamin E oil, it'll fix you right up. Detective, would you like a cup of coffee? I'll be stationed outside for the next few hours, till my relief gets here. You're gonna stay outside all night? What on earth for? Although Joel Chessman's body was recovered at your cabin, Melody Chessman's still at large. You think she could come here? It's not likely, but we'll keep your house under 24-hour surveillance until we locate her. Thank you. If there's not enough blankets in the guest room, just let me know and I'll pull more from the closet. Oh, Mrs. Tubbs, Rob and I can stay in my apartment tonight. I mean, the attic is just up there. Absolutely not. That attic apartment it not as secure as the main house, what with all the deadbolts on the doors and locks on the windows. Besides, you're better off here where both me and that nice detective can keep an eye on you just in case. I still can't believe it. You know people for years, and then something like this happens. It's pretty crazy. Mrs. Tubbs, I was actually hoping I could stay with Delondra too, so I was wondering, could I maybe crash on the couch tonight? Or you could just sleep with Delondra. I know I may be a church lady, but I don't always have the morals of one. What's the use of sinning if you can't be forgiven? Amen. I'm still too upset to eat. I hope little Danny can eat tonight. I can't imagine how scared he must be, staying with people who are complete strangers to him. I mean, they're not really strangers. They are his real parents. But, yeah, he must be really scared. It happened so fast. I barely even got to say goodbye to him. Well, at least you got to see him off. What about me? You'd expect that they would at least let him spend a few days with me so he could adjust to the fact that his entire life has just been turned upside-down. I mean, he may never recover. Melody and Joel are the only family he ever knew. All that love, all that kindness. It doesn't matter. No, they just took him away. He's been kidnapped all over again. All because of you. Are you saying that Danny was better off with the people who kidnapped him? Whoa, Mrs. Tubbs, no disrespect, but clearly Melody and Joel are the ones in the wrong here, not... not Delondra. I'm sorry, please forgive me. I... I think I'm just... Just very upset over the whole thing. Hey, this is, um, this is some delicious cocoa. Thank you. It was Danny's favorite. Mm. I would serve it to him when he would stay overnight with me sometimes. Am I ever gonna see that boy again? Of course we will. We just need to give his family time to adjust. Okay, I know it's gonna take time, but I know we'll see him again one day. We don't even know where he is! They just put him on a plane to God knows where. He's with his family. His family was here! Because of you, Joel is dead. And Melody? She's just lost in the woods somewhere to fend for herself like an animal. You just left her there! Who does that? I expected so much more from you. I'm getting really tired of you insinuating that I'm the one who did something wrong here. Because you did do something wrong! Danny was just fine before you came into our lives! I was a fool to recommend you. I don't know how my judgment could be so off. You know what, I think Rob and I are gonna stay at my apartment tonight. Rob, let's go. Rob? Rob! Oh my God. Oh my God, Rob! He's barely breathing! Mrs. Tubbs, call an ambulance! Why are you doing this? Because you took my grandson from me. Officer Leiker! Officer Leiker, help! You've been a very bad nanny. There's no one coming to help you because there's no one who's left that can. I told you my house was very secure. All the doors are locked and all the windows are barred shut. So just be a good girl and drink your cocoa, otherwise this is going to hurt a lot more than it needs to. Are you okay, my dear? No. She made me kill George. And then she tried to kill me. You knew? You knew that Melody was the one who kidnapped Danny? Oh, you gullible little twit. My daughter didn't kidnap anyone. I did. I needed to get my daughter a new baby to raise. After my grandson died, Carol was suicidal. The only thing that was going to fix it was to find a new child to take the place of the one you lost. We could love him better than his biological family could anyway. So it was meant to be. Why did you bring me into this? Because, after seven years, this family needed a break. I was getting older. George's health was failing. We couldn't keep up with the constant demands of a rambunctious little boy. And Carol was cracking under the constant fear that someone would find out and take Danny away. - I was fine. - No, you weren't. You were getting edgy and scared and catatonic. We needed help! We needed a nanny. But we chose wrong. You were my friend, my ally. And what did you go and do? You took away everything that was precious to me. What's good for you, what's good for me, is doubly good for you. Fair is fair. Delondra! You are gonna wish you just drank my mama's cocoa. I'm gonna make sure this hurts really bad. I'm gonna make this hurt real bad. Delondra? Show yourself! Carol! Oh, honey, honey, are you okay? Are you okay? Oh! Delondra! No, no, Delondra, let us out! Delondra, come on! Game over. Delondra? Delondra! Rob! Open this door! Rob! Rob! Rob, wake up. Rob, wake up! Please wake up, Rob, Rob! Hi. Delondra. It's me. No, you're gonna be okay, okay? I'm gonna call for help. Delondra! You came! Of course I did. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Hey. Oh, the cake says "Danny." What happened to "Aspen"? You know, after everything our son's been through and adjusting to his new life with us, the last thing we could do is take away the only name he's ever known. So, everything's good? He's happy? Ask him yourself. Hey, Danny! Delondra! I can't believe it! Here, this is for you. You didn't have to get me a present. You already got me one. You do? You brought me back to my real parents, and that's the best thing I could ever ask for. Well, I hope that you get everything you wish for. I already did. You're here, just like you promised. Remember, pinky swear? Pinky swear. - You wanna do this cake? - Yes. All right, everybody, cake's ready! Come on over, cake time! Gather around! All right, on the count of three. Ready? One, two, three!
