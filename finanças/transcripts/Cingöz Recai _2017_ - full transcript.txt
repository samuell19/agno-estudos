Göze, how is your vacation? -Pretty good. -Don't you want it to be better? THESE ARE POISONOUS I love it! -Okay, tell me now. Where is he? -Who? Didn't Eren Deren make all these? Eren? My boyfriend. No, Göze. That gentleman did. Who is he? Hello? Hello? Hello! Who are you? Why did you send those things? It doesn't matter anymore. Excuse me. Would you stop for a second? What do you mean, it doesn't matter? Let me put it this way, I was charmed when I first saw you. I asked who you were. They said you're half Italian and have a good family. So, I made the gesture. But I regret it. Why? Because you're a liar. -Excuse me? -The note I sent with the chocolates said they are poisonous. A funny sense of humor. No, it's funny that someone who speaks Italian ate them. I don't know why you're lying, but... But these earrings are fake, too. Don't be upset. You were too beautiful to be true, anyway. Who are you? I'll tell you when we meet again. So, boss? Did it? -It did. -What happened exactly? The bird's in the cage now, I think. -Bird? -The key person for our new job. -Göze. -Wow! Starting again, huh? If we don't, why did the boss bring us all the way to Russia? This looks like a warm up. Sadri is right. Warm up well. -This time it's going to be tough. -Finally! Finally, some action. Just like the old times. -Welcome, Göze. -Thank you. Welcome, Eren. That necklace deserves to be on your neck more, don't you think? No, Eren. It looks very expensive. So what? How can I steal your heart if you don't accept any of my gifts? Aren't you with me because you couldn't steal it yet? Dear guests, we're at the fashion show where Zuhki's fall collection is to be announced. If the heart of the fashion world is here today, that's because the famous model Cara Delevingne will be carrying that heart on her neck with an emerald necklace. -Superintendent Mehmet Rıza? -That's me. Hello? Hey, partner. Didn't you miss me? Cingöz! How is your wife? How are the grandkids? You had an assistant, Sevil. How is she doing? Oh, I know. She's in jail. You're right. You cornered me the last time. But the game isn't over yet, partner. Don't call me partner. I'd just arrived at White Manor. I was opening the safe and I thought something is missing. My partner. Oh, excuse me. If I hadn't called, you would've been upset. I'm stealing the hot necklace everyone's talking about. Chief inspector Mehmet Rıza. Patch me to the emergency line. Pull over. We have police and cameras. Easy! Operation Necefli Maşrapa is completed successfully, boss. -What are you doing? -Slow it down! Pull over, I'm going to get off! -What the hell? -What are you doing? Pull over! Drive slowly! Hotel manager? Are you the manager? -I was just going to the safe. -Don't go anywhere. I'm the assistant of Inspector Mehmet Rıza. He's on the way. -This is a crime scene now. -Why? Because the vicious thief Cingöz is at your hotel now. Don't let the hostess out of her room. I want to talk to her, too. Sir, you don't know this man! He might have cooperated with anyone. Even with you. Come here. This way. Mehmet Rıza? -How do you know my name? -Your assistant told me. -My assistant? -Yeah. Where is he now? He's at the penthouse, interrogating the hostess. -Let's go. -To the safe? There's nothing left inside the safe. -To the penthouse. -Okay. Hello. What? Is she the thief? Did you break in through there, or the window? Dear incompetent manager, the thief didn't break in through the window. He got out through the window, thanks to you. Cingöz got inside freely. He had his friends with him. He knew the police would come as he called me. The only thing he had to do was to come before us and go to the floor where the safe was. You looked at them just like that while they were going, right? You also opened the door personally. But he was so confident, Inspector. -Chief! -What? I'm chief inspector. Yeah, chief... How do you know that it happened this way? I know even more. You stayed here for ten minutes... But Cingöz doesn't rush things. He started the preparations. He lit his cigar. He took a sip from his coffee, special from Anamur. And started working. Filiz. I'm ready. Is everything ready there? The distance between us and Mehmet Rıza is 14 minutes, three seconds, boss. I'm sorry but how do you know so much about this guy? Let's say we have a common past. July, August and September Don't stop smiling ever Life's too short, believe me We don't get to see summer maybe Life's too short, believe me We don't get to see summer maybe I don't care, I don't care I don't care about the world In daylight? How could they steal it with so many guards around? -Göze? -Yeah? -What happened? -I thought I saw someone I know. Sir! Cingöz is back, Fikret. Dressed like a policeman. Attention all units. The thief is dressed like a policeman. Who are you? Um, sir, her name is Hülya. She's the one who's supposed to be newly assigned to our unit. Who told you to report it, kid? -Was I supposed to set up barricades? -No need, thanks to you. -Why? -Because he heard you. Who heard me? Dispatch, this is 56-48. I think you're looking for me. I'm right outside. I'm waiting. Over. -Come on! -Fikret, buy me a döner kebab when you return. Yes, sir. What have I got myself into? Dispatch, this is 63-55, suspect is headed to Nişan Street. Block the road at the other end. Attention all units. I'm turning right. Follow me. Over. Dispatch, this is 51-42, suspect vehicle's pulling away. Over. What's up, Cavit, how are you? -Fine. -The back exit is this way, right? -Yeah. -Thanks. Wait a minute? What's going on here? I see him. This way. Come on. I really want to stay and chat, Cavit. Spurious confessions from an honest thief. -Come on! -Come on! But I've got to go. Please accept my gift. Put your hands up! Don't move! Good job, don't you think? It is, but this poor girl's out of order now. Why don't you take her to the garage and end her misery? I was just going to say the same thing for you. Why didn't you? Couldn't you form the sentence? -I didn't want to go hard on you. -Shut up, kids! We're home. Why don't we see this trophy for ourselves, huh? -I gave it to the police. -What? You gave it to the police? Why? Boss! -What's this all about? -How should I know? We'll see eventually. Peyami, my boy! When are you going to talk, my boy? Peyami? -Sir, your sandwich. -Take it. Look, we have döner. Would you like to have some? Would you? -I want to submit my report. -Hülya, isn't it? It requires patience to make the parrot talk, Hülya. As it does to catch Cingöz. You can't catch him by running after him. Yeah, but we've already got him and taken him to court. And Cingöz wasn't the thief. Oh, really? Who was, then? His name is Cavit Seyhan. We also found the necklace on him. I'm sure there's tons of evidence against him, right? You must've found out his other crimes not related to the robbery, am I right? -Yeah, do you know him? -Nope, never heard of him. But Cingöz gave us someone, which means he's playing a game not to be seen at first glance. I think I couldn't make it clear enough, so I'm saying again. Cingöz wasn't the thief. Do you know Cingöz, kid? Yeah, the notorious master thief. Fifteen years ago, one of the most valuable jewels in the world was stolen from the jewelry fair. A necklace covered with 20 carat diamonds. In daylight, there were hundreds of guards around but nobody could understand how it happened. Sir, but... You can't catch Cingöz with descriptions, kid. He has thousands of faces. I understand, but technology has evolved so we can identify suspects much more easily. He's got cutting-edge equipment. He even invents some of it. A special interest for him. I see, he's good with high tech and his secret is cutting-edge equipment. He knows everything very well, he can succeed at anything. But he knows something better than anything. -What's that? -The human soul. "Think of a thief, a thief that never kills anyone, never steals from innocent people and think of a thief that shares what he steals with poor people." -From your interview. -That's right. He busted Cingöz four years ago. He couldn't escape and fell from the Bosporus Bridge. He couldn't survive. No, Fikret, Cingöz is alive. The question is, why is he back, as a man who always does everything for a reason. I think you chose the wrong day to die. You can't die on a sunny day like this. You can. I'm sure Alan Turing didn't think so. Adile Sultan, I haven't studied for the artificial intelligence exam tomorrow. Please, don't make me get confused. What have I done? If you don't want to get confused, get out of the water. Come and have some cookies, come on. Cookies? Don't drop it! If I don't, I can't have cookies. You won't have any, anyway. You're on a diet, no cookies for you. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -No. -Yes. -That's what I'm talking about. Go on. Don't quit. -What? -I'm about to break a record. You can't break one while hungry. Have some of them. Let me see. That one's too big for that, anyway. Try this one. That was the last thing you didn't know about. Too small for that. -You have tea? -Yep. Thanks. I couldn't fix it yet. Why don't you check the second gearbox joint? Gearbox joint? What's that? I don't know. I made it up. I know nothing about cars. Come on, don't be late. CLIMBING RALLY OF TURKEY You miss him so much, don't you? Yeah. He left not getting enough of you. He didn't leave. They took him from me and I couldn't do anything. That's enough. You were a kid, what were you supposed to do? But I've grown up now. You have. You've become a sturdy one. Had he seen you, he would've been so proud of you. No father would be proud that his son has become a thief. Don't keep calling yourself a thief. You're no thief. You're Cingöz Recai. Your father's proud of you. He will be, Adile Sultan. He will, eventually, if not now. What? I'm out now! Forget about the deal. Because you lied to me, you tricked me. I'm a racing pilot, not a courier for your dirty business. And you threatening me now? Bring it on, you bastard! There you are, my little Recai. Come, don't be afraid. Come, what do you say to arm wrestling? Come on, be my opponent. Come on. Take a seat. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Who did you talk to, Dad? A friend of mine. It doesn't matter. Come on. Don't lie to me. You don't yell at a friend like that. Sometimes you need to be tough. But not always, sometimes. At arm wrestling, for instance. Come on. Come on! Push it! What are you thinking? Don't scare me. Would you gather my tricksters in Filiz's room? I'll tell them why we're back. We're all ears, boss. Inform us. This is Cavit Seyhan. The guy you took care of today. Yep. This guy was the driver of the gang before he was busted. Yusuf Kaba. He breaks doors and skulls. He's the muscle of the gang. He's like a giant. Not as lovable as you, though. I can hunt the BearHunter. Well said, am I right? Sadullah Yılmaz. The confusing and cool guy of the gang with disguises. Codename, Arsène Lupin. Don't let him fool you. He's nuts. A great sharpshooter. This is the worst of them. Adil Tekir. Leader of the gang. Let me show you the crime scene from his last job, you'll get the idea. Why did we only give Cavit to the police? We should've brought down the whole gang. How could I replace Cavit, then? Here we go. Tell us then, boss. Why should you be in this maniac's gang? Because they're planning a robbery. That girl... Göze, that beautiful cheater is the girlfriend of the man they want to rob. Then rob the man with us. Why are you doing them a favor? Because I don't want what they'll steal. What I want is the power behind the throne. The Ghost. Nobody has ever heard his voice or seen his face. He's unreachable. But I'll have that honor. Don't drive us crazy and tell. What do you want from the Ghost? What did he do to you? He killed my father. But, sir, what should I write for the report? I don't know, write what you've found. His name was Cavit? Yeah, but Cingöz Recai... Quiet. Don't set the Thames on fire before I figure out why he's back. Nobody should know. Do you have any idea, sir? Why could he be back? Because of why he came back the last time. Cingöz isn't the kind of guy to be busted on the middle of the Bosporus Bridge. He was up to something then, too. He must have a weakness. And I'll find out what it is. I've bought something to cook for dinner. Nope, not for you. For me. You don't deserve to come to my house yet. Okay, I'll visit you tomorrow. Okay. Love you. Bye. Hi, gorgeous. She's been dealt with, boss. Good. Tie her up there. Hello? We have the girl. What should we do now? Boss, we have a problem. There's someone there. Who are you? My name's Balatlı Ömer. Aka, Ömer the hairdresser. Aka, Ömer the cheetah. -Aka... -Why are you here? What I wonder more is why are your hands tied? Had I got in here freely, and that's how I did, you would've tied me up anyway, right? -I would've. -Then you have to pardon me, BearHunter. Wait a minute! How do you know our names? Boss, he's a cop. Should I finish him? You're after a plum job. And I'm here to help. Really? -How can you help us? -Let me explain. -BearHunter. -Yeah? Push the button, dear. As you know, Eren is the owner of a security company. A tech genius. Also a social media monster. He has two million followers on Instagram. He shares photos of his houses and boats. He's recently invented something. A smart system that will change home security all over the world. We already know that. It was in the newspapers. Everyone knows. What everyone doesn't know is that there's a safe only Eren knows about, underneath his base where every celebrity goes in and out every day. Is that right, Adil? You want to rob that safe. Because in that safe... BearHunter, push the button, dear. Mihrap. The lost painting of Osman Hamdi. -Its worth is approximately... -500 million. It's clear from your eyes that you want this painting. But there's a problem. Eren's base is one of the most secure places in the world. Tricky business. I love it. It's in a place even the best thief can't break in. Only one person can. His dearest girlfriend. What's happening? Help me! What do you want from me? -Tell her, Arsène. -As you wish, boss. Now, ma'am, I'll slit the throat of this man next to you. There'll be too much blood, so I apologize for that now. But I guess this is the best way for you to get the point. Tell me what you want! It's quite simple. We'll replace a painting in your boyfriend's safe with a counterfeit. And you'll get us inside. In other words... Welcome to the gang. Boss, what should we do with him? -I think my expertise would be useful. -Oh, really? -I'm a driver. -No shit. Do you want us to give you a car? There's no need, I've brought mine. BearHunter, my man? Can you push the button? How could this car be here? I have my own qualifications, as you'll appreciate. I heard your driver Cavit got busted because of that emerald job. It's the eleventh hour for you. Do you have time to find someone before the robbery? Let us investigate you first, Ömer. You'll be our guest until then. Thanks. Arsène, BearHunter. I'm glad to see you again. Me too, Cingöz Recai. How did you know I'm Cingöz? Tell me about it. I'm surprised, too. The mighty Cingöz is sitting here with hands tied. Do you want me to sit like this? How did you do that? Tell me how you knew and I'll show you. It's up to you. Untie me, or I'll tell them you're not tied. How did you know I'm Cingöz? Tell me and I'll untie you. I won't. Blighter! Smartass. Show off. I can't believe you. It ruined your beauty. Let me fix it. -God damn faker! -Oh, please. I'm an honest and clean thief. So? I'm waiting for your answer. Hello. -It's closed, sir. -I'm not here to get shaved. I'm here to shave. Where's Ömer? Ömer had something urgent and left early. -Really? -Yep. Cut the bullshit. Now you and I will sit and talk about Ömer a little bit. -You have time, right? Are you available? -Yeah, sure. Let's order us some tea and then have a chat. Do you have anything to eat? I'm starving. Okay, I'll tell. Well, it was your appearance, your body, your smile... You gave me the eye. Do you know how I knew, actually? The amulet on your neck. It was there while you were both at the beach and the hotel. Do you think that shitty amulet will protect you from these men? Oh, shoot. No time left to untie you. So that thing must be important for you. I was inconsiderate. I'm sorry. If you say so... I won't untie you. Okay. Our boys have thoroughly investigated you, Ömer. You're free. Thanks, BearHunter. Now, I have to go. Me? What about me? You're with me tonight, gorgeous. Let's see how much you're willing to cooperate with us. I'm going to test it, gorgeous. Hey! That's mine. It's my wristband. I won't let anything happen to you. Don't worry. -Thief! -You're the thief, BearHunter. -I've come to see Eren. -We know about it, ma'am. -You can go. -Thank you. Welcome. Eren's looking forward to seeing you. -Then why isn't he welcoming me? -He's in a meeting, you can come in. Pass it in! It's inside! Look, our project group's here. What do they do? Wander about. Sit and enjoy themselves. Since childhood we've been told that we were hopeless, Göze. I want to change that now. You and your crazy team. Come. Welcome, Eren. Look. Films are shown here 24 hours a day. Why? People find inspiration while watching films. But people will get lazy and won't work. So what? We have something nobody in this world has. Creativity. It's time to take that from the foreigners' hands. Come. I'm a person who has faith in his country, in his people. For years we've been looking at the past but there's something we fail to notice. -What's that? -The future. The future is ours, darling. As long as we believe in ourselves. -My hero. -You haven't seen your present yet. What present? I don't lie. I set up traps and steal. But I don't rob anyone who doesn't deserve to be robbed. I'm after the noble bandits. Always. And you'll say what you want from me? I want from you to be patient for one more day. I have a very important thing to do. Don't worry, it won't get to you. -And here's the explanation! -Wait a minute! We don't have a minute to waste! It's about my mother. Hey! Don't bring your mother into this. I'll kick your ass. -Shut up. -Sadri! Okay, you can keep me here but my mother should be worried sick. Poor woman has nobody to cook for her. She has nobody but me. -What's going to happen to her? -Give me the address. -You didn't give too much, right? -Come on. Tell the truth, for God's sake. How much? I looked like I was touching my butt. Don't do this. Wait and see. May God be pleased with you, son! Goodbye. -Come on. -How much did you give her, boss? You told me about your favorite food in Italy. Chocolate machine! Göze? Have I done something wrong? I just... I was... I have to confess something. Tell me. You can tell me whatever you want. I was... When you weren't there... I put on four kilograms. -Is this what's troubling you? -It's... I want to eat them all. All of them, but I can't. Not when I'm like this. Okay. Tell me. I'll do whatever you want. Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want. -Whatever I want? -Whatever you want. Call my fitness coach. Of course. Okay. -What are we going to do? -We'll put on their shoes. -Darn! -At the same time. Okay, begin! Where is it? Wait, the phone's ringing, it doesn't count! It doesn't... Chief inspector Mehmet Rıza. Good evening, partner. Wow, my dear friend! I was about to call you. I'm sure you were. Believe me, I'm closer to you than you always think. I know, pal, I know. So am I. Let me tell you something. Today, Zeynep found a puppy on the wall when she came out of school. She put it in her backpack and brought it home. She's hiding it in the garden. She's afraid to tell you. -So, I thought... -You didn't have to go to the trouble. I could've handled it. It's my job, after all. Open your bag. You won't regret it. Grandpa, what's that? Did you buy me a gift? -Say yes. -Um, yeah. Eren will be robbed. Help me and I can get the robbers. Leyla... Good for you doing that. You need to protect her, after all. She doesn't have a father, you need to become one. Do you know what I've just seen? What? You. You wake up in the morning in a hurry. Have your coffee. After that, a little workout... Every morning, I never skip it. Do you never? Then? You go to your wardrobe. You're a meticulous man. Choose something suitable for today. You dress up, get excited. Because you have work to do. You're going to buy a gift. Right? Then you visit a pet shop. Not one, I visited a dozen of them. Then you think. Which one should I buy? The red one? Or that beaded one is prettier? You can't decide. That's your granddaughter. Hard to please. Isn't she? You wait for hours in front of that shelf. You get worried. You don't know what to do. -Do you know why? -I'm a meticulous man. No. Because you don't have a child to buy gifts for. You don't have any children, siblings, or parents, Cingöz. You're an orphan, kid. You're jealous all alone, on the other side of the phone, my granddaughter's laugh and that I'm hugging her and playing with her, aren't you? Because you don't have a family. I have to go now. This time it's different, right? This time it's personal. I know you. Kiss her for me. Take good care of her. You were always alone. You're still alone. And you'll end up being all alone for the rest of your life when I get you cornered and catch you, do you know that? I know, partner. I know. That's what I've been counting on from day one. Then tell me where you are, -I'll come and get you and end this. -Of course. Of course. Ask the new member of your family. She'll tell you where I am. Eren Deren's house is going to be robbed. Help me and I can get the robbers. Then I'll turn myself in. You told me to get someone inside, and I did. So, one of us will be the fitness coach. Fitness coach? Boss, let me be the fitness coach! Please, let me! Tell them, Ömer. I'll be the fitness coach. You want the guy in sight to be someone expendable. So that if I screw up and get caught, your plan will still be on track. Good job. Well said! Thanks, I know a thing or two. But you're missing something. Do I accept it? Do you? Maybe, if you ask nicely. Boss, stop asking this fitness coach. -Force him. Break his skull. -Break it. Tell them, boss. There's no time to make a new plan. Everything's ready. There's a big opening at Eren's house tonight. He'll demonstrate his new security system. Everyone will be there. Things will get crazy. What do you say, Ömer? Tricky business. I love it. Deal! Electronic circuit breaker, liquid nitrogen freezer... You're trying to be James Bond or what? A circuit breaker won't work. Fingerprint spray won't be useful. This house is protected with the highest tech. This plan won't work. -Do you have a better plan? -I always do. -Right. -We'll do this our way, not the Bond way. Could you hold it? You won't take anything with you. I'll get all the equipment inside. The only thing you need to do is take the place of the security guards. Got it? Will it work just like that? The simplest cases are the ones that look the most complicated. It'll work. But first, we need to locate the safe. The safe... Okay, dear friends. The lesson is over. While you're having a break, I'll talk to Göze about this fitness coaching. -Alone. -Oh, alone. Okay. They're discussing it. Discussing what? They'll kill me when the job's done. We'll kill Ömer and leave him there when it's done. -Why? -I hate his guts. But you have another plan. Always. What happened to your lip? It's nothing. Did BearHunter do that? God damn animal! Don't go. It doesn't hurt. I'm okay. And I'm not afraid. You told me you won't let anything happen to me. I believe you. Please. Don't go. Why are you smiling? You said you believe me. Yeah, I believe you. So what? In general, people have a hard time believing me. But I believe you. Well, then, I should find the safe's location. We don't have much time. So, when are you going to propose to her? We need to get the invitations ready, boss. Enough with your jokes. -Is it done? -It's done, boss. I placed the bug on the car. He was talking to someone when I finished. We're going to finish it tonight. Where should I bring the trophy, where should we meet? I'm writing it down. Thanks. This is it. -When you get that note from Adil... -I'll find the Ghost. What happens when you do? You're breaking in to Eren's house alone, and you'll go to the Ghost alone too? Get it, boss. We go wherever you go. -Are you never short on surprises? -Never. One, two, three! I can't believe it. -It's like a dream. -That's my private floor. I've made a couple of changes for you. You can work out as much as you like with your coach. CONNECTION ESTABLISHED You need to wear this ring inside the building, Ahmet. The chip inside it will show me your location. Your security number is 336. If your take off the ring, the alarm will go off. OK? OK. You can park your car over there. -Thank you so much. -No problem. I should go and get changed. What should I do with my jewels? There's going to be a lot of people. I saw the newspapers. There are many thieves around. Are you talking about Cingöz? I saw too. He made the headlines. Don't worry, baby. He's an old man from the past. He can't compete with us. We should put them in a safer place if you have one, though. What do you say? You've become obsessed with safety today. Haven't I? Too obsessed. I'll go and get changed. My coach will be here soon. What are you doing here? I thought I could work out while I'm here. I'm working out to reduce my stress. Göze, I wasn't completely honest with you. I have secrets as you do. Like what? Like this wristband. What is this exactly? Ciao bella! Mehmet. -Where have you been? -Mehmet. Ahmet. Ahmet, Mehmet... Don't get hung up on names, you're here. Let me look at you. The safe is opened with a wristband. It's on him. I'm not happy with what I see. You've put on four kilograms, gorgeous. Come. Let me introduce you to the man responsible for the weight. Ahmet. -Hello. -Hi. I was just leaving. I have guests. But honestly, I'm jealous of you. Göze and me? Has she told you? What? What's there to tell? A weekend in Sorrento. That's it. You two, huh? For a short time. Just two days. Those two days. We shouldn't make you wait. -You have a lot to do. -Nope. I'm going to keep warming up. Of course. Eren and I are friends from college. He used to say he'd save the world, but we didn't believe him. But he's accomplished such things that now we believe what he says, right? Like this. Now turn. Great, Göze. But the back should be straight. Great, gorgeous, great. Now, backwards. -What are you doing? -If you don't like it, I'll stop. Now, the other way. You know what? The gains in here are only for showing off at the beach. If you have any suggestions, I'd gladly hear them, Ahmet. Just like that. Are you interested? I always do some. With a trainer, sand bag. I also have a training partner. Shall we try? Let's see if the money paid off. I'd love to but I have guests upstairs. They're waiting for me. I have to go. Oh, I'm sorry. Come on, Göze, continue. But now I'm curious. I didn't know you were so interested. Show us. Okay. I'll show you a couple of moves. I've come to take over, man. But my time isn't... -You ready? -Yeah. You? -Always. -Good. He must've worked pretty hard. Ahmet, this one is called spinning back fist. It's enough for you I think. We can stop. What do you say? Stopping? -We've just started. -Really? Yeah. What would you do when the security you're so proud of is in danger? Ahmet, I said the same thing to Göze. This is the most secure place in this country. -This place? -Yeah. -This place? -Yeah. Only you and I are here in this ring. What's keeping me from taking that wristband? Yeah, Eren? Come. Do you understand now that these toys are for nothing? You've never had a fight in your life. This is your first fight. Göze? Who are you? What do you want? That wristband on your wrist. That guy's nickname was Ahmet Uysal, right? His number is... 336. The safe is there. One day we were on a spring vacation. With Eren, of course. Where the hell is this guy? I've nothing left to say. I don't know him that well. Um... We woke up in the morning and guess what... That's the signal, we're going in. Police! Move away! The code changed. We're going code red. Everyone, go to the inner court. Quick. Come on. Arsène, kill Ömer. Kill him. BearHunter? How was the event? Did I miss something? Shrimp sandwiches. Delicious. -Wow! -Pull yourselves together! Open it. BearHunter. You have ten minutes. Come on, go for it. Go, go! Come on! Um... -What's this place? -What is it? -Where's the safe? -Where is it? Wait a minute. -He's playing a game with us. -How? I infiltrated your gang, wrecked your plans. I found a partner in crime I could work with. A beautiful one. -Göze. -That's right. I took the bullets from the weapons, saved the girl. I get you caught. And I'll get the painting and get lost. Good for you! How? How could one man do all these things by himself? Oh, fuck! He's not Ömer, he's Cingöz. Cingöz! BearHunter! Kill him! This one's for Göze, BearHunter. You don't hit women. Now you made me very angry. Right on time! Had I known that you love coffee, I would've been quicker to finish you. He put something into our coffee. Potassium sulfur chlorate. -Thanks. -Effective in seven hours. It doesn't kill but it incapacitates. But I didn't have coffee. That's the beauty of it, Adil. I have a special recipe for you. -What's that? -We'd both prefer to die -than go to prison. -We'd rather blow our brains out. Is that right? Let's see about that. I'll get out of here soon and lock the door behind me. And I'll put this ring before the door. The alarm will go off. And a police friend of mine will come and put you behind bars. Till you get old and die. No! I took the address from your pocket, by the way. I have a special show for the Ghost. In the meantime, this is my last favor for you. I'd not waste it if I were you. Stop! Who are you? Access granted. Thank you. So, where is the safe? Don't do it, Göze. I'm trying to do something good for the country. -I'll give you everything. Don't do it. -The safe. Wait a second. What's that? Wow! Our next generation modern guy isn't as innocent as he seems. Secret places, armories, he's infiltrated everywhere. What did you expect? Who do you think would provide such resources to a college boy? You made a dirty deal. You infiltrated everywhere, under the cover of the security system. That's right. Wars aren't won by armies anymore. People like us decide the fates of countries. -You asshole! -You traitor! -The safe! -The safe is there. It's there. Open it if you can. Guys, are you there? Oh! Thank God we've heard from you, boss. We're here. Where are you? I'm where I'm supposed to be. Filiz, I'm sending you a code now. You need to crack it, right now. Send it, boss. Guys, have I told you before how much I love you? Nope. I don't remember such a thing, boss. Maybe you did, but we didn't hear. If you want to hear it again, you have 25 seconds left. I'm telling you. Don't be so sure, boss. We might have a lifetime before us. Come on, Filiz. Good job, Filiz! Boss? Guys, are you there? Boss, are you there? Sir, we got the thieves. Adil Tekir is here, too. He shot himself. But no sign of Cingöz. No sign of Cingöz, I know. Do you know what I learned from my father? I was a little girl. I was living abroad with my family. While we were on a trip... Eight times six? 48! Good girl. What do you want to be when you grow up? Supergirl! I'll save everybody! Dad! Don't be afraid, honey. I'm with you. Dad, are we going to die? Aren't you Supergirl? Nothing will happen to you. -Seven times seven? -49. Good girl. Six times four? -24. -Six times two? -12. -Three times three? Nine! Okay, honey. Okay. Calm down. The plane crashed while descending. My mother didn't survive. My father didn't survive. Nobody but me survived on that plane. The numbers are our fate. Only the math at the origin of life saved me. Four times eight equals 32, Dad. It's right, Dad. Come on, show yourself! I waited for my father to show up in one of those ambulances. You father won't be back, kid. But he gave me his word. -And he kept it. -I had nothing but my numbers. Nothing happened to you. He gave you a special power. The power to survive. Now you'll survive no matter what happens, like me. But I don't want to survive. I want my father. I don't want to be alone. You won't be alone anymore, little girl. I'll always be with you now. That man took me with him. He raised me. Made me ready. For what? For today. The Ghost! It was his plan. He set me up with Eren. He's the one who put me in the gang. He knew. He knew that I was after him. But I didn't. He never mentioned you. I figured it out after seeing you in that warehouse. The salvation. You were accepted. Only Cingöz could pull a trick like that. Of course he didn't want the painting. National secrets obtained by Eren. He's going to sell them to foreigners. And he made me do it. He used you. How couldn't I figure it out? How? I see everything. Why couldn't I see you? Do you know why? Because a part of me really believed you. It believed that you are a man, to protect me, to love me. What makes you think I love you? Because I'm... Because I'm... Close your eyes. As long as you're the one doing it. Go and take a look inside while I'm filling the tank. Maybe someone left something for you. -What kind of thing? -Something you deserve. Dad! Dad! Daddy! I couldn't make it, forgive me. Forgive me, Dad. Filiz, it's done. Copy that, boss. You dealt with the men. You opened the safe. Took what you want. You got out freely in the rush. You had already planned your escape. But this is a serious job. This escape should also be an insult to us, right? He's in front of the parking garage. Cingöz! Have we finally met, partner? Don't try anything stupid. Prison isn't for me, you know that. Cingöz, don't. Never forget this, partner. I have an immortal soul in an unassailable body. Cingöz! Cin... Don't shoot! No, no! Don't shoot! Don't take him into the car. Don't take him into the car! Don't take him into the car! Don't take him into the car! You thought we'd be late, right? Accept it, boss. The day we're late is the day we die. How is this one? Well said, big guy. Don't push him. One more job to be done, right, boss? You're right, Sadri. We have one more job left. Grand finale. You ruined a great legend. You broke him into pieces. I should say I'm a bit upset. But not as much as you are, I think. This was my last job. You promised me. Look at me, Göze. Can you forget this face for your life? I can't. And that's why I can't let you go as long as you're alive. You're mine. Till death. I'll buy you one if you want to play. I don't feel like playing anymore. What happened? You've become a shadow of yourself. I did everything for my conscience. But it makes me feel empty now. Then stop it. I'm not like you. You work for the future of all of us. But I'm stuck in the past. -What's the point of living like this? -What are you talking about? I was watching you. What could a thief teach to that kid? No, you have your own qualifications. Like what? Am I to teach how to crack a case? You had to make me say it. You're an honest man. You have principles. Those are your principles. I stole them from you. You know what will happen in the future, right? I'll catch you one day. I know, you told me. Prison is the only future. On that day I go home and tell my granddaughter, "Remember today, kid. Today, a hero left us." Way to go, partner! That's exactly what I thought. -This was a game, too? -Always. -You jackass! -That envelope is for you, partner. So, what do we do now, boss? We're going to bid. Here we go again. If we're to give what we win to the police, then I'm out. Don't count me in. Why are we doing such things? Because if there's any profession that combines theft with doing police work it was invented by me. The meeting is set. Come on. Come on. Another player will join us. What? I hope you didn't start without me. This gentleman represents a buyer from Germany. United States, Russia, Germany. I see you have many friends, Göze. The rules are clear. You can bid as much as you want. And this is the prize for the winner. I wonder what you are going to do when you get the documents. A power threatening the whole country. But we're not just playing among ourselves. That's the problem. Let me be clear. We're all thieves here. And we're going to steal Turkey's future, right? But nobody living in that country is aware of this. 400. No. 80 million people live in that country. If each one's worth ten dollars, 800... You think each one's worth ten dollars? What about you? What do you think? Thanks, I'm relieved. That's all from me. Oh, one more thing. Don't move. This is a robbery. He couldn't pick up. Filiz, your turn. Look. A bright young lady. The future of my country. Game over, everyone. Interpol will breach in five minutes. Wait, what? Their leader is a Turkish policeman. Good deal for ten dollars, right? Don't waste your time. That door won't open. Yadigar, how are you doing? -Who's the strongest one? -You are, of course! You can't find a guy like him for ten dollars. Wait, what are you doing? Filiz, show him. I don't know that woman. But Cüneyt is the fastest man in the world. Really? Does she know what you've been doing? That you have suicide squads in Ukraine and Serbia, that you're one of the dirtiest agents ever? Sorry, let me correct myself. Do you want her to know? Sadri! -The coast is clear, boss. -Let me introduce you. Sadri the badass. Great heart, nimble fingers. Also, I trust him the most in this world. Thanks, boss. You made me sentimental. I'm not a simple thief, my dear friend. I have a name. TOP SECRET The Ghost must've figured out something went wrong. That's what I'm counting on. Faster. Cingöz Recai! I'm convinced. It's definitely him. Boss, I'm tracking. I'm leading you to the location. How does it feel? Letting me slip away from your hands after years of pursuit? Take a look at the file in your hand. You think I haven't? You need to make a decision now, Cingöz. Are you going to take your father's revenge or run after your country's future? You worry about your future, Ghost. Your foreign friends won't be able to save you. Now that you've decided to be a hero, one last lesson, with great sacrifices come great prices. No! Göze! Göze! Göze, you're alright. It's okay. Hang on. Göze, hang on. Filiz, call an ambulance. Quickly! Göze. Stay calm. The ambulance is on the way. It's on the way, Göze. Hang on. Göze, don't try to go anywhere. I won't let you go. Look at me. I made a promise. I promised to save you. You've already saved me. You loved me, right? -You did. -Göze, don't. Let me hear it once. Say it. Say it once. I love you. Göze! GREAT SUCCESS FROM TURKISH INSPECTOR Peyami? How are you, my boy? How are you? Guess where I went. I went to foreign countries. You still can't say a single word, can you? Partner! Did you say something? Take the call, partner! -You shouldn't have done this, Cingöz. -I visited your office at night. -I had a chat with Peyami. -With Peyami? With my Peyami? Don't say that, partner. He's our Peyami. You'll see whose he is when I catch you. Hello! Did he say anything else? Where's Cingöz? Where's Cingöz? Where's Cingöz, my boy? -Yes, anyone else? -500,000 lira. We have 500,000 lira. Anyone? -550,000. -We have 550,000. Anyone else? -750,000. -We have 750,000! Anyone else? -800,000! -We have 800,000. Anyone else? -900,000. -900,000 from this gentleman. Anyone else? Anyone? Two. Million. Two million from this gentleman! Anyone else? It's going... Going... Wait a second. What's the hurry? Are you going to bid higher, sir? Always! Subtitle translation by Nuri Karataş
