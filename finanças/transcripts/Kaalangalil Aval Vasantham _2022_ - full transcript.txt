There isn't a soul in this world that hasn't admired a butterfly! But has any one of you... seen a caged butterfly? Look into a mirror! Yes. You are that butterfly. And your heart is the cage. The troubles humans face when they listen to their hearts... It decides to call someone a good person, only to see them as the enemy the next day! The quality that made it celebrate them, would turn against them. The beauty of a butterfly is in its independence! Who'd admire a butterfly in a cage? Think about it. "Oh! Butterfly!" 'She's spring time' 'MONSOON' 'Kaushik Ram' 'Anjali Heroshini' Hey! How many months have you been following me? Are you mute? Oh no! I can talk well! This is the first time I'm seeing up close! That's why... - I couldn't speak! - Oh! - I could sing a song for you! - Huh? I've written a song called Pappali Pappali! The lyrics are awesome! Do you wanna hear it? "Hey, papaya!" Hey! Stop it! Huh! Oh, no! Why? Don't you like papaya? Shall I change it to paniyaram? You're so funny! First, do you know my name? I'm Anuradha. Nice name! You usually don't follow me up to the hostel! What's so special today? No, I'm a Cancerian. I read in the papers that proposing today would work in my favor! That's why! By the way, I'm Shyam. And I love you so much! Hey! You're crazy! What? Is that it? That's it! Look here. You are this butterfly. You are inside me. And I won't let you out! I don't really know how to impress you anymore! Please! 94244- 31114 Yes! 'Product Aram Entertainment' "Radhe! Radhe!" "Say her name, parrot" "Say Radhe, Radhe!" 9424431114 9424431114 How many times have I told you not to get drenched in the rain? - [mumbles phone number] - What's that number? Nine... Four... Two According to me, cinema is the true depiction of love! To propose to a girl... and get drenched in the rain... to fight with swag... and to surprise her with a song! I know nothing beyond this! I'm one of those innocent youngsters who believe cinema life is real. This is not just my story. It is your story too! - The fruit has slipped into the decoction! - Decoction? She's like a white paniyaram, Mom! If I stood next to her... Even I'd look dusky! What are you talking about? The girl I was following for while... She's given her number! Oh! Is that it? I was thinking you'd cleared your arrears. You told me last year that you were in love with someone. Okay. We'll see how long this lasts! Mom! Why are you jinxing it? Falling in love with a different girl every year isn't true love, my dear! What else can I do, Mom? The perfect romance that I'm looking for... I can't find it anywhere! Does that mean I'm supposed to abandon all hopes? Listen to mom. You aren't the type to fall in love! I'll find a girl for you and get you married to her. Start your life with no expectations! It will be smooth like our life. Hmph! You and your ideas! I want to fall in love madly and get married! Someone like you who's lived with dad wouldn't understand the idea of romance! Don't say that! Rather than saturating her happiness... Living a life without bothering her is love! Do you know something? Your dad has never made me cry. He's so romantic! Hey! Good joke! I've never even seen that man smile! Romantic, it seems! Alright... Tell me why you fell for that girl. The feeling of stepping on a live wire... cannot be explained! It can only be felt by those who've done it. That's a different feeling, Mom. Nonsense! Do you want me to explain? You fall in love if the girl looks beautiful. If I asked, you'd say it's "love at first sight!" If beauty is your benchmark... You'll keep looking for a better option till the end. Roaming around like a mad man! Make a note, Mom! If I don't get married to this girl... You can call me a madman! Check and mate. Okay. Idi Amin is back! Forget what I just said. "My dad's back home!" "He's gonna give me advice!" Hey! Shyam! Yes sir! My close friend is visiting us after a very long time. He moved from the US three months back! When he's here tomorrow, act decent! Don't wake up late and act like a hobo in front of them, got it? Heil Hitler! Why does he give me the slip when he sees me? Is he up to no good? Don't doubt him unnecessarily! It's nothing! If I'm not this strict, he'd put his hand on my shoulder and say 'Isn't this chick gorgeous, bro?' He's no longer like that! Ever since he started working, he's become very responsible! Go, freshen up! I'll make some coffee for you. She's enough to spoil him! 9- 4- 2- 4... He'll never change his ways! My son is so fond of chicken biriyani! Is that so, Aunty? "Radhe! Radhe!" "Say her name, parrot" "Say her name, Radhe, Radhe!" Alright. So what are your plans? Are you going back to the US or are you settling down here? Oh, that? My daughter has to... "Radhe, Radhe, say her name!" Oh! He's here. My son Shyam! "Radhe! Radhe!" "Say her name!" Shyam is very brilliant! After completing his degree in engineering, he got placed in the campus interview. He's been working ever since! Now he earns three lakhs a month. Oh, is it? He's in automobile research and development! I figured out the research he's doing from going to his bathroom yesterday! Hey, Sundar! You haven't changed one bit from our college days! The same of sense of humor! You said you wanted to have a look at the house I'll show you around. Yes! I need to see how the architect built his house. At the first glance of your house, my daughter said This house looks so beautiful, Mom! Is that so? Thank you! - My son picked out everything! - Is it, Aunty? All I ever did was pick up the bricks. He built the house! Let's go! Uncle! You go ahead. I'll have a chat with Shyam. Sweetheart! The coffee is in the kitchen. - Take it from there. - Okay, Mummy. Wonder what's going to happen! Hi! I'm Radhe! Oh! Radha? No. Ra- dhe! I'm Shyam. Yeah, I know. Are you interested in R&D? What? No way! My mother must've hyped it up! I'm not interested in any of that stuff. I studied engineering for my dad's sake! 20 arrears! By the time I could clear 19, three chief ministers and two prime minsters have come and gone! I've felt of late that I'm roaming around without an aim. Which is why... I fell at the feet of my father's friend for a job. I make 30,000 a month! Now he earns three lakhs a month. Then... What else interests you? I'm interested in cinema. My love... My passion... My soul... Is cinema! Oh! Then you must be creative. You're going to be a well- known film maker some day then! What? No! You must think highly of me. I'm mad about watching cinema! I watch every other movie in the theatre, on the very first day! From STR to Superstar... Every single one is my favourite! Okay. Then... What else are you interested in? I love going to the pub. I don't drink that much... but to make up for that, I enjoy ogling at girls! My father hates me because of this. Do you read a lot of books? Only Facebook! Those are my dad's collection. He wished for me to be just like him. I felt that the household could handle only one genius and gave up the throne to him! Alright! Tell me more about you. To put it simply, I hate everything you love. If I started talking about what I like... You'd get bored, I guess! Oh, please! You aren't at fault. I think my DNA is at fault. I don't know why, but... I like you very much. Thank you! Thank you! Everyone says that! Wherever I go fans throng me! If you like me too, can we get married? "Oh, butterfly!" "Fly, fly, fly, fly, In the sky!" What happened? You look stunned! Didn't I tell you then? My son is quite brilliant! Mom! Is that girl mad? Was she an inmate at some mental asylum in America? Or did you make her some upma in the morning? Hey, your dad is in a bad mood already. Sneak upstairs without blabbering a word! I'm not the one blabbering! She is! You wouldn't believe it, but do you know what she asked me before you walked in? Oh no! Did you tell her the truth about your salary? Our honor is lost! You twit. That's not it! She... asked me if I wanted to marry her. She asked you? She studied in America and owns a startup. Did she ask you this question? She must be kidding! Oh, she was probably kidding! No, Aunty! I really meant it! I like your son very much! I left you alone for ten minutes. What did you do by then? He didn't do a thing! It was love at first sight for that girl! What a bunch of crock! Can a girl not feel love at first sight? Should it always be limited to guys, Dad? You stood there brushing your teeth like a duffer! How could any girl fall for that? That is what I like! He was very down to earth. If she knew what kind of a doofus you were, she'd leave of her own volition! I don't need someone brilliant. I need a guy who's honest! And he's handsome too! There's no chance! My close friend's daughter is like my own daughter! I can't spoil her life. You cannot take care of her! I like him, Aunty. If he feels he doesn't want me, you don't have to convince me! So let him decide, please. Should I fall in love with someone whom I chose? Or should I marry someone who chose me? I'm so confused, buddy! Don't annoy me, bro! I can't find a girl because my stars aren't aligned. Hey, why are you so confused? Whoever seeks you out is always the best! Don't ever listen to what she says, buddy! Only after you marry will you know if it's an angel or the devil! If you fall into that trap, you'll be torn to bits... without anyone to fall back on and end up financially ruined and become a pauper like me! Hey, who wants to know your history? - Hey! - You decide who's best for you! You're too fast! I don't think so. Why do you rush to get married? Exactly! That's my opinion too! Date him for a few days and then decide if you want to marry him! I don't believe in dating, Shalini! Even Shah Rukh Khan would become boring! Then, we'd seek out another chance... And it goes on! The human mind can never be satisfied completely! I need commitment. To fight or to have fun! It should be with the guy you've always wanted to! What is it that you find attractive in him? I can't spill it out all at once! I'll tell you as and when it comes to my mind. To start with... He's a real doofus! In all the boys I've met in my life he was the only one who didn't want to impress me. He's a casual guy! Guys do this tactfully, knowing all too well that girls love it! Don't you think I know that technique? But... He was very genuine! I felt like he was being himself. I got the feeling that he's my soulmate at the first sight! He has a great sense of humor. I hate watching movies. But he loves to! If I married someone with the same tastes as I do, I'd get bored! He's very manly you know! I love his mom too! She's so innocent. So much so that you can figure out when she's lying from the way she talks! She's very sweet. I felt connected from the minute I entered their home! Usually, when you spot a beautiful house you think about buying it! But I felt like living there. Maybe this is what love is! Guys! - Hi! - Hey! I've decided to get married. HEY! Oh... Congrats! I could kind of make that out. You look like you've been dipped in bleach! Live a happy life! How'd you come to this decision? Wheat flour is healthier than refined flour! - Eh? - Hey! Is this a reason to get married? Isn't that enough! As though you need a reason to get married! The routes don't matter when you're headed to the cemetery! Glad to hear that, sweetheart! Great! Rest in peace! So, do I get to call you a madman from here on? Mom! Please! Forget the past. On one hand, I'm very happy that a girl like this is coming to our home! You've miraculously given the nod to get married! On the other hand, I'm worried about you! At first sight, I felt like she was my soul mate! You had a choice in love. Marriage is one- way! Give it a good thought. I've thought about it, Mom! Checkmate! Go on! She's waiting for you. Hi Shyam! How are you? I was fine. Till the day I met you. Now I'm acting like a mad man! Is that so? Take off your glasses da. What? Da? Why? Should I call you brother? Oh no! Da is fine. What are you looking at? I was trying to weigh the love in your eyes! How much can you spot? Enough to drive me crazy! Let's get married. Oh! Are greeting cards still a thing? Hello! As long as 90's kids like me are single, greeting cards and roses will hold value! Okay. Love you, Anuradha! Who's Anuradha? Is she your ex- lover? No... I thought that was your full name! Don't lie! You are like your mother. I can tell you're lying from the way you speak! Hey... That's not... I'm being serious! Please! Trust me! I'm being honest! I thought Anuradha was your full name! You are such a doofus! And you better stay that way. I love that in you! "The dream that took the form of a woman, Why does it rain today?" "As you pour upon the earth, My heart gets drenched!" "My love floats like raindrops, Is this even real?" "Like a dew drop, The silence melts away!" What? She hates the rain? "Like the white clouds, I float and soar away!" "I grew, like crops ready for harvest!" "I'm the black and white Of the rain clouds!" "Shall I color you like a new rainbow?" She's totally worth it! "You performed magic in my heart!" "Everything looks so beautiful" "As I step foot in this dream world" "A breeze flows gently, Touching my heart!" Stay blessed! Thanks a lot, Shyam! For giving me the life I wanted. Is it? Okay... What are you going to give me? Take your hands off! You shouldn't touch a girl - without her permission! - Hey! You are my pappali! I'll do what I please. Hey, Shyam! What are you doing there? You can pop balloons later. Move away from her! Oh no! Grandma! I didn't do a thing! She's the culprit! He takes after his grandpa. He resembles him in all aspects! Are you still a virgin? I thought you were a playboy based on the list of girls you've fallen in love with! Hey Ekalaiva! The deed isn't important. It should be romantic! If you have a good idea, speak up or I'll learn from YouTube! You can probably learn cooking from YouTube... Fu... Are you trying to stir me up? Now, look! Desires aren't like a T20 game that you rush into! It's like a test match, you need to be patient and willing to wait! You seem to have played a long game! Which is probably why you got divorced early. You've insulted me! I'm cursing you now, your first night will never happen! Hey! Ekalaiva! I'm sorry! Hello? Hi! Hey, where are you going? You want to sleep now. Is that all? Go ahead and sleep! A girl's pain of being with a stranger on her first night is something I understand. I have watched Mouna Ragam. Is it? Okay, go! You watch that movie for another 10 years. You'll only keep watching movies till the end. What now? This apple... Apple? The demand for the apple you bite is too high. That's what is there behind iPhone, which is being used worldwide. - For this apple? - Yes, the same one. "Hey lottery, lottery babe!" "I want to live with you, my dear!" "For the day to bloom as a flower!" Hey, come on. Let's get drenched. Get lost! "You are the sweet cuckoo, my darling!" - Then, is this your decision? - Hmm! "You will be drizzled upon, my honey!" "I was born to live with you!" Why is the swimming pool so dirty, Aunty? You should question your husband about this. Alright, I'll build a swimming pool as you asked. But you should take the responsibility for maintaining it. Think about it. Dad, I'll maintain it really well. Look at how it has been maintained. I'm a state- level chess player. But I love to lose to my son. Did you think I'll have a downfall? Awesome! The only bad habit my son has... He doesn't know to apologize. "A lotus out of water" "Looked up into the sky, my love!" "Rain of flowers" "Is asking to be sprinkled!" "The days I live near you" "Is not lust- induced!" - Mom, dad is calling you. Go! "Is this love in my heart?" "As I look for a word about you!" "Ask the rain shower" "I'm your love- buddy!" "Change your ways" "The heart asks for it" "Very sweetly today!" "Hey, lottery, lottery babe!" "I want to live with you, my dear!" "For the day to bloom as a flower!" "You are the sweet cuckoo, my darling!" - "You will be drizzled upon, my honey!" - Hey! Hey, hey! "I was born to live with you!" Hey, don't act too much. Shyam! Boss! What is this? Come on. Follow me. "Hey, lottery, lott- - " Shyam! What do you think of yourself? I see you have been coming to office everyday. - Boss, what's the problem? - Stop talking. A wheat flour has placed her trust in you. Boss?! - How did you know? - Everyone in this office knows. Your close friend, Ekalaivan... He is not just Ekalaivan... But Triplekalaivan. He was the one who spread the word about your flour. Look! You are newly married. You should go on a jolly honeymoon. Oh, that? We are really having fun, boss. Damn it! How will I make him understand? You... Hey! Haven't you watched the movie Roja? Do you remember what all Arvind Swamy does with ice? 'Do you remember what all Arvind Swamy does with ice?' Boss! This wasn't even on my list. Super, boss! Just go to Kullu Manali and be happy. This is how I used to be with my wife when we were newly married. My God! Don't let Triplek know about this. He'll ruin it. Hey! Don't tell your dad. I'll be dead if he gets to know. Papaali! Surprise! - What is this? - We're going on a honeymoon. Kullu Manali! What were we doing here all these days? Whatever happened here is nothing. We'll go there, play with the ice and have fun. Did you ask me before booking? Then it wouldn't have been a surprise, idiot papaali. I'm allergic to hill stations. I have tried a lot of times and I've been disappointed with those trips. You'll be fine if you go with me. Listen to me. We'll only end up fighting if we go there. I would have considered it if it was Goa. Hey, I cannot waste this leave sanctioned by my boss without even a loss of pay. In that case, you go with him. - Then, is this your decision? - Yes I put so much effort to buy this ticket. Dear, do you know what happened in Marumagal Marupakkam serial yesterday? If you keep watching serials, then I'll give you a divorce. Stop joking! Daddy! - Huh? - Mummy! You have a surprise! This is the first thing you have done right in your life. Thank you! How did it occur to you to send us for a second honeymoon? It just occurred, Dad. Take care of the house. - Don't let Chocy down. - Alright. Leave now, Mom! - Fast, fast! - Bye, Shyam! Go, go! Just get lost. Yaay! Hey, pappali! I have got rid of the senior citizens. When are you coming home? You are such a sly fox! But don't get angry. I have a very important conference. I'll come home a little late. I don't care how late you come, but I have a condition. You should only cook dinner. Why? That's the condition. Okay, done. What do you want? Did you wash your hands? Hey, dumb papaali. Do you think I asked chappathi to eat? Crooked fellow! I didn't know chappathi had so much romance. Not just in chappathi... It's there in all dough items like parotta and poori. Then... don't you want dinner? Let's cook dinner together... but not eat it. I'm so happy! You? Why won't I be? Do you know how long I have dreamt of this? I totally understand why you have 20 arrears. Okay, tell me. How did you like me at first sight? What if I was a bad guy? As if you are a good guy now! Give me a serious answer. I married you only to find out why I like you. At the same time, I wish to live all my life without finding out why I like you. Why? God or love... It's interesting only as long as there are unknowns. Huh?! For me 'love is God.' You know... Manmadhan is my ancestral deity. Is it so? I'll ask you something and I want you to tell the truth. Who is this butterfly? It is you. What kind of question is this? - Really? - It really is you. Why? I thought it was Anuradha. Hey, I was just kidding. Why are you overreacting? Don't use this as an excuse to run away. You have to clean the hall. Is this even a problem? No, Preethi... I feel she's stirring the past for no reason. Just give it a thought. Who wouldn't suspect if you give the card bought for one girl to another? She really had a big heart to marry you after all that. Hey! I don't want anyone's sympathy. I didn't beg anyone. - That's not what I meant... - You said it right, bro. It will start here and end in divorce. They will spin it as if you asked for that divorce... - Only then can they get compensation. - Hey, shut up! - Get lost. - Don't generalize your problem. You always keep talking negatively. - Let's go, Shyam! - As if madam is so positive. Come on. Will they get back together? Thank you! Actually, I wanted to invite you all home. But I came here myself to give a surprise. Oh, how sweet! Thank you, dear. Your biriyani is very professional. Is Ambur your hometown? There was a fool living with me for six months, as my wife. She has never even prepared a maggi for me. So sad! - [mumbles] - Let him be. Come! You also join us for lunch. No, no. I'm a vegan. Vegan? You have cooked chicken biriyani being vegan... How did you learn this? I gathered what Shyam likes even before getting to know who he is. So, I started learning everything immediately. Shyam, let me tell you something. I just realized I shouldn't be judgemental about people based on my own experiences. You've hit gold. Keep it safe. Chocy! Is this your decision? Love you! 'SPRING' Hey, where are you going? Hey, please. I need to leave urgently. Go man, go! Go past our corpses. Then what? Didn't you read the mail? You better leave after finishing your work and sending the mail. Hey, hey! Please! I have very important work to do. Even we know what that important work is. Hey, Preethi! You too? Traitor! Who is the traitor? You or us? We'll sit here and send mails, but he will go home and... Are you trying to stir me up? Deal with that Orangutan whatever it is. I understand your urgency. - Even I'm going there. - Boss, boss! Follow me! Please boss. I have an important work. What? Ice cubes, right? Stop kidding, boss. Oh, don't get me started. Kullu Manali got canceled. Hey, will someone go all the way to Kullu Manali for ice cubes? Hey, pappali. Where are you? I'm just leaving work. Come soon. Wait and see what I do. I just want to feast on you... Hey, don't do anything foolish. Shalini is coming along, okay? - Muah, muah... - Hello? - Muah, muah... - Hello? Hey! Shyam... Hey, my husband is this crazy romantic type. - He won't bother who is around. - Is it? Where is your romantic husband? He must be upstairs. Wait, I'll call him. My papaali! Oh God! I'm so dead! I'm so sorry, Shalini. I'm feeling really embarrassed. No, dear. I was here at the wrong time. Wait, I'll drop you. No, it's alright. I'll hire a cab. Please... I hope you won't tell this to anyone at work. No! But what you said is true. What is it? Your husband is really very romantic. Hey, you leave now. You might not get a cab, so hire an auto. You... - Hey! - You really embarrassed me. - Don't do it, papaali. - You... Damn! It might hit at the wrong place. - Listen to me... - Let it hit. I don't care. Hey! You are dead. Yaay! Hey! What happened to your cheeks? The dog bit me. Dog bite? Would that dog's age be 18? Hey, shut up. He's married. Don't talk rubbish. So what if he's married? It isn't something I haven't been through. Dog will come... bite... - Hey, Ekalaiva... - Here it is. - What? - Will you never play with men? Shyam, did that ice cube idea work? I see hard evidences. Keep it up! Player! Let him be. What? Do you have important work even today? If you escape today, then that's it! Hey, Shyam! I'm going to Bangalore for a week. Client meeting! Muah! Sorry, dear. Emergency. Take care of Chocy. Give him a bath with shampoo. Okay? Bye! Hey! Hey, Shyam! Hey, hey! Hey! Do you have to leave immediately? I'm already late. What is so urgent? A very important meeting. I need to go to the Bangalore office. Even I had an important meeting yesterday. But I came home for you. Yes... and you embarrassed me. Shall we play a game? Oh! This game? This is a wonderful game! Not this. You wish! We shouldn't talk to each other for one week. No calls, messages, or WhatsApp. Why so? They say a small separation will deepen the love. There's nothing like that. Which dumbo said that? I'm telling it. Just like how you are crazy about me, I too wish to be that way at least for a day. I want to long for your calls. I want to yearn to see you. I want to feel all those too. Our life will get boring if you keep coming behind me always. So, the game starts now. Turn! Oh God! One important rule - whoever calls first is the loser. Oh God! Then I will lose so easily. If you lose, I'll extend the game for one more week. Hey papaali, please! What does it mean if you leave halfway? It means we don't talk to each other for one week. Bye! "Something inside me is distracted" "It floats as a fuzzy puzzle!" "The search to relish love In separation is taking off!" "The moments you aren't with me" "It is a beautiful addiction in itself!" "The words spoken while being messaged" "It becomes a babble And I search for your fingers!" "The nights that didn't see small pecks" "With your shirt being my playmate" "I lust after your scent!" "As love multiplied with time" "I realized it to be a treasure!" "My wild womanhood is softening!" "And you are the thief!" I'll listen to anything you say. Just for you! "You are the thief!" Should you listen if I say? Can't you at least send one message? You are such a doofus! I need just that. And that's what I like about you. What is it? You are in some dream world. It's nothing. It's written all over your face. Tell us. I just thought it would be nice to have Shyam around. Oh my! Him? Please no! My modesty is on the line. Shut up! - Hey, what happened? - It's nothing. I have never see you date like this. I am just trying to be Shyam. Go to your Shyam mode later. Now be our boss! We have an investor meeting today evening. So, let's get started. Come! - Come on, let's go! - Hmm! Hi! What is it? Do you want to see Radhe? No, I want to meet you. Please! I came all the way to meet you. Come on. Let's maintain this distance. Hey, this is too much. I threw ice cubes the other day mistaking you for my wife. Alright, let it go. What did you call me for? I'm planning a surprise for Radhe. I want you to help me with it. Please! Okay, tell me. What should I do? I miss him! "Hey, papaya!" "I became a fan of The trouble maker days back" "I became restless watching her, My angel in white" "Her words were like poetry, My daredevil" "And dancing to her melody, I became viral!" "Our love story garnered Loads of fans" "And I kept you within, My queen of Insta Reels!" "My ravishing papaya!" "Your captivating beauty Is like a walking piece of art!" "Hey, my dazzling papaya" "You make my heart race!" "Here I come forth, Right behind you" Checkmate. One more. One more. "O butterfly!" "Fly, fly, fly in the sky!" "O butterfly!" "Fly, fly, fly in the sky!" "A fun and stylish person, I am" "My sweet talk would enchant you!" "A chill yet crazy person, I am" "I live a life of my own free will!" "It shook the cringe girls And mesmerize the boomer boys!" "Let's create an epic love story!" Who's that guy? "I became a fan of The trouble maker days back" "I became restless watching her, My angel in white" "Her words were like a poetry, My daredevil" "And dancing to her melody, I became viral!" "My heart's as comfortable as a Benz" [in Kannada] Who is that fellow? Enquire who he is. "...and travel worldwide!" "My ravishing papaya!" "Your captivating beauty Is like a walking piece of art!" Come here, you! What do you think of yourself? How dare you come into our area? Bro, bro! Calm down, bro. What's the matter? My owner doesn't like the current song. So scram. Is that all? -Why do you make a scene for that? -[in Kannada] Do you know what it means? You cannot sing in Tamil here. Get lost now, you! Shyam, let's leave. As if there aren't any other pubs in town... Screw them. Them and their "hogu"... Spending days consuming routine food, Speaking petty tales which is of no good, Toiling in vain with a dejected spirit, Doing deeds which possess no merit, Turning senile with grey hair, Burdening life within your lair, Like so many people who live in vain... Did you think I would fall prey to these follies? Shyam! Ouch! Come get me. What have you done? What did you expect? I planned to surprise you in person! And when he spoils it... - do you expect me to stand still? - So what? Would you fight them? - I fought for your sake! - For mine? Yeah! Must I not express my love for you? You don't need to fight to prove it. We're married! And not teenagers. Please! Don't do this again. I can only express my love like this. What will I do if something happens to you? Come on, my pappali. Why do you worry unnecessarily? Also... You know Bharathiyar's poems, huh? I only know that one poem! Yeah... But how? Have you not watched the movie, Mahanadhi? When I heard this poem in Ulaganayagan's voice, I had goosebumps all over me! It made you feel like bashing a few people up. I see. And I too wanted to implement this somewhere... Then, the opportunity came! Will I miss it? So, you never watched that movie? Such a doofus you are! Remain this way, okay? Because I love you this way. Even if you had to search, you could not have found a groom like him! I love Shyam so much, Ma! My love is nothing compared to his! Okay Ma, I'm hanging up. Trespassers will be prosecuted. Yeah, yeah. As if. Idiot. How to impress a girl! Okay... Rains - from Minnale movie. Street fight - from Run movie. Bharathiyar poem - from Mahanadhi movie. Did you think I would fall prey to these follies? In a single cool drink, two straws. We'll buy a single cool drink bottle, with two straws in it, let's gaze upon each other's eyes... Chappathi dough - from Alaipayuthey movie. Chappathi dough... Do you think I asked chappathi to eat? 2006 - Anandhi. 2008 - Rebecca. 2009 - Sneha! 2010 - Anjali. Madhumitha... Sangeetha... Anuradha... Rains... Hey, let's get drenched! Candle light dinner. Wow! This is so romantic! I love you so much! Do you... Do you know how long I have dreamt of this? I know, I know. Okay, come. Let's not wait any longer. Have a seat, please! We must savor every second of this! Do you know how long I planned to do this with you? How are we both alike? We're just made for each other! Enough of the act. Have a seat. A beautiful... ...and a caring wife like you... I didn't think I'd ever get this! Why are you silent? Nothing. Your happiness is mine too. Alright. How did you know... ...that I like this gesture? Or is it a mere coincidence? I cannot believe it! Like it was written... Did you read my diary? Yes. Why did you read it? It's very personal. Then me? So, what is the issue? Aren't you happy with me? I understand one's possessiveness after learning about their past. Have you not watched movies like Autograph and Premam? It isn't wrong for one to have had one or two failed relationships. I don't care about your past relationships. And I know there are married people with hidden pasts. But after I entered your life, your love must only be for me! I'm crazily in love with you! There's no one else in my mind. So, don't doubt me. If I were to, wouldn't I do that based on Anuradha's greeting card? Then what? See, you aren't getting my point! Your... Your idea of romance is my biggest issue! You've made a checklist for every girl you've dated! And I'm just another girl in that list. You want to get drenched in the rain... You want to stand on the shore... Must eat the same icecream... Must fight with swag and to surprise her with a song! This doesn't seem like a list to impress a girlfriend. But to impress yourself! All these actions are deemed as love to you. If someone else was in my position, you'd do exactly the same! Have you ever thought if she liked to visit Kulu Manali, or eat ice cream, or even like to fight! Is it wrong to fantasize romantically about their fiancée? Your ideas aren't wrong, Shyam. Those must pertain to just your girlfriend! You may have dated a lot of girls before marriage... But that should be a 1000 different love stories! To test out a particular design, love isn't an engine that's tailormade for all cars! Do you think I still follow this? I threw the diary away the moment I saw you! I wrote this way back! You believe that old diary but not me, right? Is that so? Fine. Tattooed on your chest is a lone butterfly, right? To how many people did you lie that it was them? You lied to me as well! Wouldn't you be hurt if I said it was for someone else? I lied for your sake. You could have lied to me about many different things! But the lie that it was me? That was only to impress me. All your actions to impress me are what I don't like! I assumed you weren't this way and fell for you! Oh, God! What more do you want from me? You said that you loved me. I accepted. You said that you wanted to marry me! And we did. And now you decide what I should do next! I'll do it. To be honest, you never really loved anyone, Shyam! You've mistaken stalking girls for love. First, realize that your idea of love is superficial! You be yourself, Shyam! That's what I want! Do all these cinematic gestures only if you mean it. From the heart. But don't assume this equates to love. Or... You could greet me with a smile! Do anything! That is enough for me! I made a mistake, bro. I shouldn't have married. Feels like I rushed into a trap. Why? Did she have a diary too? Then what? Tell me clearly what happened! Don't you know me, bud? I've dreamt of a perfect romance since my childhood! As those dreams come closer, I feel like I'm ruining it! Oh! Did you meet refined flour recently? No, dude! I was supposed to meet her that day! If I had hit send on my WhatsApp text to her, my life would have been way different! It was her! Who charmed me with her words. And now? She blames me for everything! She says my actions aren't deemed as love! She says "it's cinematic"! And asks me to "be myself"! Didn't she realize my true self before marrying me? Hey. Hey! Listen patiently to what I say. I know nothing about her but know everything about you. You now think Anuradha was a better choice, right? Who knows? She might walk out on you when she doesn't like you anymore! It's impossible to find a girl that checks all your boxes! And that's the truth. That's it. Listen... I'm not saying this out of anger but from experience. Only when you're alone and struggling, will you realize the value of your wife. Could I have apologized? Could I have treated her a little better? You would think that you could've compromised a bit! She won't be beside you then. Amid the battle between sorry and ego, lies all the divorce cases of the nation! Listen up! Don't overthink and let go of her. - What do you mean? - That's all I have to say. Are you asking me to adjust and move along? Heck yeah! What else did you think? Adjusting and compromising your ego is love! Did you think these cheesy gestures are called love? Definitely not, dude. Love has only 1 rule. Everything must be mutual. That's it. The rest that you mentioned, right? A perfect romance! That doesn't exist, my boy! All of it is a myth. Alright, then. Since you're a know- it- all, tell me why you divorced your wife? Why didn't you adjust with her? I wondered why you didn't ask me this. Life is like a funny game, dude. In that, his own experiences won't matter to him. And it'll be used only when advising another individual. The advice that I give you now - If you live your life and die in peace without sharing it to anyone, it means that you've lived your life to the fullest! Please be patient, bro. Time will heal everything. And make you understand. But you need to make space for that. If you think too much about it, that's when unnecessary thoughts rush in. Could you stop here, bro? Please reverse a little. A little more. Shyam? Alright, let's go home. Shyam! Come dude, let's go! Don't worry about it. Shyam! Shyam! Shyam! Shyam! 'SUMMER' What are you thinking? Mmm? In this vast universe... I'm searching where I am at! It's difficult if you are still searching from outside. Seek within yourself. That's right! -Are all bookworms like this? -Mmm? Bluffing some nonsense pretending to sound brainy. Just like my dad! Bookworms are a total bore to people who only read Facebook. Dear God! I have no idea how I married her! It's hard for you to be yourself, right? You hate it, right? If you give a banana to a monkey that is used to swing and leap, it'll only scheme to snatch it and run. But it doesn't get that the banana was for him in the first place. Hey! Who are you calling a monkey? Will I ever call you that? You are a doofus. I referred your heart. Oh... I see! Can I tell you something? Are you gonna stop if I say no? Get done with it! This butterfly on your chest... -Is not me, Anuradha, -Dear God! or anybody you have ever loved, Shyam. This is you. Have you ever seen a butterfly fly straight? If you map out its flying track, it looks as innocent as a baby's scribble. Look how spontaneous that is! Your love is just the same. There should be no pre-planning. If you plan the things to do beforehand, then it is not love, Shyam. Mmm? Are you done? Good night. How do I put up with her? Hi guys! We need to go out of station regarding an important client meeting. Two people can go. Who is interested? Did he start sleeping? -Boss! -Who's that? I'll go. Nope. You can't go. You have many things to do in your house. -With the ice cubes... -Hey! What are you going on about ice cubes?! Why is he suddenly getting worked up? Sorry boss. Don't make me mad, boss. I'll go, please? Shyam, I thought of you as a naughty boy. But you are a very good boy. Okay. Who else is willing to go? Nope. Do you know the venue? Pondicherry Beach Resort. Sir! Sir! Sir! I'll go, sir. I'm ready! Hey! Stop it! Have you all never seen Pondicherry? Come, bro. Let's go. -You sinner! -We'll go, sir. We are coming back from Pondicherry only after satisfying the client. Damn! I can't even pluck a hair in this house. Hey! How did you know? I'll tell you if you kiss me. -Give me the trimmer. -Try and take it from me! Anuradha often tells me I look handsome with a beard. Let me try that! Thank you. What is this for? To hang myself? Dad! Bye. -Mom! Bye. -Mmm. [TV Programme] You remember the rules, right? The same game. We shouldn't talk to each other for a week. No calls, no messgaes and no WhatsApp. The one who calls first loses! Okay? Then I'll easily lose, Shyam. If you lose, I'll extend this game for a year. "In a forlorn cage Like a free Ibis" "Like a candle I'm slowly melting away" "Like a bird drenched In your love shower" "I'm searching and longing For your shelter!" "You became my whole world!" "Your breath fuels my life!" "Now, why did you leave me stranded?" "I wither Like a dry leaf stuck in the wind!" "The pain of parting My heart suffers for the first time!" "My nights stop dead I wish that was a dream!" What is this for? To hang myself? "The truth makes my soul humble!" "What happened to us? What is happening to us?" "Tell me, my love!" -Shall we play a game? -Oh! This game? -This is a wonderful game! -Not this. You wish! This butterfly on your chest... This is you. Hey! Will anyone shoo away a butterfly? I am not sure why buddy. Nowadays, I get so irritated at the sight of butterflies! "In a forlorn cage Like a free Ibis" "Like a candle I'm slowly melting away" 'SUMMER RAINS' Hey Shyam! What a surpise! I gave you my number. Why didn't you call me? Do you how I ran after you at the beach the other day? But you left already. Okay! I'm staying in room number 110. Let's meet for dinner at 8 sharp! Hey Anu! It's getting late. -Come quick! -Don't forget. Dinner. At 8. Deal. You guys won't change. You guys will never change. Hey! I'm gonna surprise Shyam at the candle light dinner. I'm gonna ask him to marry me. Yay! [singing "Mujhse shadi karogi"] I'm so excited! Buy your own trimmer, man! You have everything in double, right? Hey! If you leave midway who is gonna answer the orangutan? I love you so much, my papali. I missed you so much. Are you drunk? Or did you hurt your head somehwere? No. My heart is hurt. Sorry! Your cheesy corny lines don't work for me! -You didn't believe what I just said? -No. Ask the trimmer. It'll say how much I missed you. What are you looking at? Tell her! Shyam missed you a lot. Very smart! I believe you. I have a surprise for you too. HEY! Wow! When did you clean this? Hey, how did you know I liked swimming? I know it! Thank you so much, my papali. Join me! No! It's just for you. Look inside! I swear! I closed my eyes and sketched you. But when I opened my eyes, it turned out as a butterfly! Isn't it beautiful just like you? What happened? You are happy, right? What are you looking? You are happy, right? Tell me! Hey! What is up with you? You just called me papali, hugged me, and coddled me! -Now you are pushing me? -Did I ask you? Did I ask you to marry me? I was simply whiling away somewhere. We are married because you said you liked me. Now you torture me, asking me to change into cockroaches and butterflies! Okay. I said that. Where did your senses go? -You could have said no! -Hey! How's that? I should have said no is it? It'll take six months for me to muster the courage to talk to a so-so girl. You are breathtaking. That too, you asked me to marry you ten minutes of knowing each other. I should have said no is it? No men on earth is that sensible. So what is your point? Are we always gonna be fighting like this? My God! You are the one who is fighting. I still love you! You are the one who doesn't understand. I might have gone behind many girls. But will you believe me if I say you're the first woman I ever touched? Yes! I was never behind lust. I felt you were my soulmate the moment I saw you. I felt I could leave everything behind just for you. But you? You make it hard to forget my past by bringing it up again and again. All problems started the moment you touched this butterfly. I'm scared I might start to despise you. According to you, everything I do is fake. Is that it? Let it be. That's me! I'm a filmy guy. Love me as I am. Or leave me alone. But please, don't ever preach and go on about love! What happened, dear? Why are you not at work? No Aunty, I'm dead tired. That's why. Oh! How should I deal with your son, Aunty? I was about to talk to you about that. How did you know? I knew it when you dried that already-dried saree, Aunty. Tell me! You are such a smart girl! I'll say what I wanted to say. My son is a very good person. Only thing is, his ego gets the best of him. There is only one way to deal with him. What is that? Doesn't matter how big the problem is. A sorry can fix a lot of things. Sorry? I have never apologized to any one in my life. That's the problem. When you apologize, you'll feel relaxed. It's totally fine if you feel like it's not your fault. No harm in apologizing. Sorry... should come from my heart. -How should I do that? -Sir, someone has sent you a bouquet. I am sorry. Radhe. You asked me how right? This is it. Learn from her! You might have seen horror movies. But have you watched it with the devil itself? I'm the devil that possessed you. You can't be exorcised that easily. You may have loved many. But... I am the woman that married you after falling in love the moment I laid my eyes on you. Please! If you are still mad, at least go watch it with someone else... Or take me with you. With love, papali. Do you want popcorn? Okay! Cheese or caramel? Buy them both and mix it together. Get lost! Gotcha! The first time, you missed my number. Second time, at Pondicherry- Do you know how long I waited for you? Why didn't you come? Let's see how you are gonna escape from me. I had a meeting. That's why. Meeting or dating? -Do you have a girlfriend? -No. -At least be honest about that! -No. What are you looking at? No use trusting you. I'll call you myself. I'll see you. So... Which movie are you here to watch? Conjuring! You too?! And you? I'll be back. Hey! Where are you running to? Hey Shyam! You should have told her that you are married, right? Why? You are looking for a back-up is it? Yes. Hey! It's written all over your face. Why are you confused? Not just me. All men face the same crisis. Tell them to say otherwise. I'd like to see them. Hello boss! Is there any righteous man out there? Mmm? Can't hear you. No, it seems. Uncle! When did you come? I didn't see your car outside. She dropped me off before going to the temple. I had some work to do. -Take it. -Thank you. What's the problem? Nothing, Uncle! I'm fine. It's okay to fail in life once. It's okay to fail in our choices. I don't believe in love at first sight! I knew we'd reach this point even before your wedding. Sooner or later. Tell me now. Do you feel bad for rushing into this too soon? Sorry, Uncle! That's something personal. I love him very much! Is this love or your ego? A lot of people confuse self-ego with love. Listen, Radhe... You are a brilliant girl. You aren't able to cope with the fact that your intellect failed you. You are unable to come to terms with the bad choice you've made! You want to fix this damage before anyone finds out. No. Not at all! You are desperately trying to prove that your decision was right. Had this been an arranged marriage, you would've walked out by now! You are sticking to your guns just because this is your choice. Because you can't blame anyone! You think you'd look like a fool if someone found out! Is this what you call love? Love isn't about celebrating the positives in someone... The ability to stand by someone despite their negatives... That tolerance is love! Love accepts everything. With all the flaws. If you can, try to accept him with all his flaws. If not... Leave him and live your life, as you see fit! Don't hurt yourself trying to change him. Just think about it. Hey! Why are you wearing my black shirt? Give it back! I'm sorry, Shyam! I'll never try to change you. I'll accept you the way you are. I love you Shyam! You look so beautiful! If beauty is your benchmark... You'll keep looking for better options till the end. Roaming around like a mad man! Hello! Hi, Shyam! This is Anu. Tell me, Anu. I want to meet you. Can you come to the beach in the evening? Today? I'm on my way to work, Anu! I'm late already. Maybe some other day? Hey, what happened? Are you avoiding me on purpose? I'm not! You ran behind me to get me to fall in love! You are the first guy to propose to me in the rain like a Mani Ratnam movie hero! -Oh no! -What happened to you now? Please try to understand what I'm saying, Anu. I can't make it! Look, if you don't come today... I'll commit suicide by jumping into the sea! Hey Anu! Hello! Hello? Oh! She's already here. Anu, I'm married. [in Hindi] I'm married. No! No! No need! I'll say it in Tamil! I'm married, Anu! Oh no! I wasn't scared like this even when I proposed to her! You walk up to her... Tell her you are married... And come back! Don't get caught, Shyam! Hey, Shyam! There's an important... Come on... Tell her the truth, Shyam! Speak up now! Standing with you as the waves wash our feet, makes me really happy! I want this all through my life, Shyam! If my phone could speak, it would tell you how many times I looked at it expecting your call! Two months after you left, Rajkumar turned up. Rajkumaran? Do you mean your dream boy? Prince charming? [in Hindi] No, no! His name is Rajkumar. That is it! Oh! Okay! We must've been in a relationship for just three months! We broke up by then! I understand. I understand how much you loved him! No, we didn't! He turned me down before I could say no to him! -Some guy rejected you? -Hmm. Looks like he lacks taste in life! Did he give you a reason? I'm apparently afflicted by Hasini-syndrome! Hasini-Syndrome? What's that? Have you seen the movie Santosh Subramaniam? Seen it? It's an excellent movie! I've seen it three times. Once for Genelia, once for Jayam Ravi-- -Hey! Hey! -Once for Prakash Raj! That's not the point! Listen to what I have to say. "You're acting like the heroine from that movie!" "You be yourself!" he said. Did he say that too? These people... Read books and advice people! Who are you talking about, Shyam? Someone else! What else did he say? "When Genelia did it, it was very cute!" "What you're doing looks disgusting!" he said. Was he this honest? My heart was broken. And we broke up! -Why, I'll-- -Shyam! Don't, Shyam! Don't do anything to him. Because... I need you Shyam! I can't visit you in jail. Please! [in Hindi] Please understand! I'm letting him off, just for your word! Otherwise, he's a goner! Shyam! I love you, Shyam! I love you so much! I can't imagine a life without you! Shall I say it now? I'm being explicit... I don't wish to sleep with you! I want to be with you. Looking at the sea... Writing your name in the sand... And even if a tsunami hits... I'll hold on to your hand and die a happy death! "Our love story garnered Loads of fans" "And I kept you within, My queen of Insta Reels!" "My ravishing papaya!" "Your captivating beauty Is like a walking piece of art!" Hello! Your acting is very bad! Just as I expected. I can't be peaceful for a while! You immediately turn up to disturb me. The reason people get married is to disturb each other sweetly. If we don't disturb each other, we'll get a lot of disturbance from the outside! I'm feeling sleepy! Whatever it is, let's discuss it in the morning. -Goodnight! -Hey, what's the rush? I have a surprise for you! Now watch me. Why'd you get my name tattooed? Don't you like it? So sweet. Phew! You haven't smiled at me like this all week! I'm not going to spare you! My teddy bear! Watch what I'm gonna do! So you can get a tattoo to impress me. But if I do that... It's a mistake. And that isn't love? Artificial. Cinema-like? We haven't been together in a while... Is that it? You could've been direct about it. Why beat around the bush? And go through the trouble of getting a tattoo? If you turn around and act angry... would that cover up the fact? Tell me! I don't even come near you these days! Is that it? You've tattooed my name on your waist. So that you can seduce me! So many girls out there... They don't even want sex! All they need is someone to be with! That's true love. But you... Damn! 'AUTUMN' "Why did you even meet me?" "You showed me soulful love!" "You are the unlucky one My love!" "You punished me with compassion!" "When would you forgive me?" "I'm always behind you My love!" "Due to my mistake My heart" "Aches and yearns!" "My eyes tear up all alone Like the sea!" I thought you'd be back in two days. It's been two weeks... Without you I can't function properly. You don't speak about the problems between you two. He insists that we don't ask! Whatever it is, we can talk it out! Please come home. You are the one who's calling me daily! Shyam hasn't even sent a message. I told you... He's a slightly egoistical! Otherwise, he's a good kid! Enough! Keep quiet! Didn't your son propose to the chemistry teacher when he was in sixth grade? When was this, Uncle? I learnt about this only yesterday! I met his school principal after many years during my morning walk! It was an embarrassment! He'd given her a poem which goes Papaya Papaya or something. The principal still remembers it and laughs about it to this day! It was a mistake. I didn't raise him properly. I admit it! You have to take care of him from here on! Why? Do you think she's jobless? Are you a father or a villain? You sound like you'll split them up! I'm saying, don't blackmail her emotionally! Let's be practical. Just this once, for my sake... Can you talk to my son in person? I'm sure he'll change once he sees you in person! Please! Hi! How are you? I was doing fine. Before I saw you! That's true. Am I the problem? I've never said sorry to anyone before. You know quite well. But I want to say that to you! I'm sorry! -Hey! It's okay, Shy-- -No! You were right in hitting me. I've spoiled your life. I'm feeling guilty! No! Come on-- For good or bad... I should've led life my way. I should've turned you down when you asked. I fell for your beauty! I mistook you for my soulmate. I've just learnt not to fall for looks. I won't hold you back from here on! You deserve a better life. Let's split up on a happy note without fights or arguments. Goodbye! "I can never be your perfect match!" "I realized that way back That's the truth!" "My heart, even if it's broken" "Cries a little for you!" "I committed deceit My companion!" Hello? Hi, Shyam! Are you coming to meet me today or are you going to give excuses? [in Hindi] Tell me! Tell me! -I'm not well, Anu. -What happened, Shyam? [coughs] What happened? -Hello? -I'll call you back! Shyam! I've been noticing that you haven't been yourself lately. What's wrong with you? Forget about it, bro! Even if you forget, looks like she won't. Refined flour is here! The chick you chased around for six months... I mean chased behind! Refined flour Anuradha is here. Hey! How do you know? I kind of figured this out at Pondicherry when you were being respectful... That she'd be the one. But you never once listened to my word! Hey! Hi! Who asked you to come here? You don't come to any place I ask, which is why I came here! Hey, don't talk like a fool! What would my colleagues at the office think about me? What's wrong with this? Introduce me as your lover! No. Why? Do you have another gal at your office? [in Hindi] What happened, Shyam? What happened to you? You look like you just saw a ghost! Uh-oh! You're a dead man! What happened to you? You are not the old Shyam. You wooed me on the streets, singing Pappali Pappali and made me fall for you! You proposed romantically, saying I'm like your butterfly tattoo! Why are you feeling shy all of a sudden! Do you love me or not? Tell me. Can you please keep quiet for a while? If you don't like me, let's break up right now! But don't call and beg me to take you back after that! And I mean it! Do you love me or not? Tell me! You better decide that and call me. Okay? Bye! Couldn't wait for our divorce? Hey, please! It's not what you think. Just shut up Shyam, okay? Just shut up! Fine, forget it. Don't run away like a coward. Start talking! Don't you feel ashamed? You've misunderstood the whole damn thing! Did you tell that girl you were married? Did you tell her? Answer me! You wouldn't have. If you had told her, she would have shamed you! Please don't end up ruining her life too! Don't act like a gentleman! Hi, Shyam! I told you to about the ice cube trick and you've set up an ice factory! You're such a player! You couldn't even come up with that! Tell me one thing that you've thought of by yourself. Listen to me. This is my office. Are you afraid you'd lose face? Let everyone know! Let everyone know that you're cheating when you have a wife! -HEY, SHUT UP! -GET LOST, SCUM BAG! You cheap pervert! Loafer! Would you lie about anything to pick up girls? -Huh? -Uh-oh! You're a guy who makes a list of girls you go out with! You're the type that runs behind girls! Shyam!? Damn! I'm pregnant! I came here to ask if you wanted to have the child. Goodbye! Shyam! Your wife is pregnant, and you just slapped her? -Go and apologize to her! -Sorry, sir! I was wrong to slap her! "I have no worry about you" But if went back and talked to her... I'll end up saving my marriage! She is very innocent! It's better to let her go! I'm sorry! Coming to your office was my mistake! What am I to do though? Tell me. I was rude because I was upset I couldn't spend time with you! I'm in the middle of some other issue! Give me a few days. I'll call you back. Okay. But could you at least come home? Just once! We aren't meeting outside. Can you come over at least for dinner, please? I won't disturb you after this! [in Hindi] I swear! If you can't even make it to this, forget about me! [doorbell rings] Hi! I was wondering if you'll not turn up. Thanks for coming! Do you stay here alone? No, I stay with my friend. - She's gone out. - Oh! When will she be back? Did you come to meet me or my friend? No... I just asked because we'll be alone. I won't eat you up. Come in. Will you eat chappathi, Shyam? Hey, do you also like chappathi? I just love to make it... Not to eat. It's unbelievable! You have all the characteristics of my dream girl. Luckily, I didn't miss you. Thank God! Thanks a lot... For coming in search of me. I love you, Shyam! Hey! Butterfly! Who's this butterfly? What a question! It's you! Do you like it? His name is Rajkumar. What happened? Who's this butterfly? It is you. What's wrong, Shyam? Don't you have just one butterfly on your chest. But to how many would you have told "it's you!" - I'm married, Anu. - Huh?! This butterfly on your chest... It's not me or Anuradha or any other girl you've been in love with, Shyam. This is you! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hi, Shalini! Where is your friend? Are you kidding me, Shyam? It's been a week since your wife went to Bangalore. Are you planning another surprise? - Do you want my help? - Oh! Didn't she tell you anything about me? What are you talking about? She always keeps talking about your naughtiness. Sometimes even I get jealous of your love. She's very lucky! I understand only now. What? How lucky I am! I'm going to Bangalore to see her. Please don't tell her. Shh! I can't stand this. Radhe has to return home. It's too late. Everything is over. Dad! Mom! I'm off to meet my papaali. I wanna meet her and apologize. I'm going to bring her back to this home. I'm going to live with her. - Hey! - Wait! What if she slaps you? I'll take it. Good! You're just maturing. After sending us off on honeymoon... This is the second thing you have done right. Go! Bring her home. See you, Mom. You cheat! Our love is not true, Anu. It's just a fantasy. We've been fooling each other. You are the one who cheated me. You could have pushed me away when I proposed to you at the beach. Yes, it's a mistake! I'm now here to apologize. I'm sorry! Raj, who asked you to be yourself has loved you with all his heart. The Raj, hidden in your tattoo made me realize that I was at fault. What a big mistake! You're simply my reflection. The Shyam you fell in love with... Exists only in this diary. And not here. Read that diary patiently after I leave. All the love you had for me will just vanish. You might even want to kill me. But you'll slowly forgive me. Then... You'll forget me. Does that mean I'm not your pappali, Shyam? Didn't you love me even for a second? You're my best friend, Anu. You're the one who made me realize who I am. Remember this. Rather than to cloy... Giving a life without hardship is true love. Go find Raj. Apologize to him. You be yourself, Anu. Take care, Anu. Hey! Who are you? Why did you abduct me? Tell me. "I became a fan of The trouble maker days back" "I became restless watching her My angel in white!" What are you looking at? [in Kannada] Do you recognize me? Brother, please! I'm no longer the person who fought in your pub. Yes, I accept it was my mistake! I'm really sorry! Let me go. You fought my men the other day. - Fight me now. - I'm not that old Shyam, brother. And I'm in no mood for this either. Please let me go. If you want to leave this place alive... [in Kannada] There's just one way out. You need to win me in a fight. You dared to sing Bharathiyar poems in our land. Let's decide this today! Are you okay, boss? - [in Kannada] Come here. - Tell me, boss! THIS IS MY GAME! - Hello? - Tell me, Radhe. I'm back in Chennai. Oh damn! Why did you come here? Why? No... Shyam has left to Bangalore to surprise you. I guess it's a flop! Wh... What? Shyam? Yes, he had come to the office today. - Did he come in search of me? - Yes! Hang up now! Brother! Winning you is no big deal. But I don't care about losing now. That's because... Only love dwells in my heart. The customer you're trying to reach is not available. I'm not a filmy hero to win all the time... Nor is this a movie. Thanks for the lesson! Your Bharathi has said, 'Tamil will die a slow death.' You die too! I don't care about dying, brother. But... I have one last wish. Please! Tell me. I want to talk to my wife, brother. No! I'm not even asking for a call... Let me just send her a voice note. Please! Hmm! I AM SORRY Hi, pappali! I wanted to meet you in person, apologize profusely, and say a bunch of thanks. That's the reason I came to Bangalore. I guess even God feared you'd change your heart and come back. I'll be dead once I finish talking. I just wish this voice note stays with you till the end. Because this is the first and the last thing I'm going to talk being myself. I accept now... Whatever I thought was love... I learned it all from movies, from friends, and from Google. I have never done anything intutively on seeing a girl. My romance is just like a plastic rose. A rose that never withers... A rose which has no scent or thorns... I understand everything I thought was real is a lie. I've been fooling myself all these years. I feel I'm being natural for the first time in my life. But you aren't with me! Have I ever called you by your name till now? But now I feel like shouting out your name. I wish to live with you. If you had changed into a butterfly the first time we met... Wouldn't we have lived together happily? For not giving the life you wished, and for not understanding your love... It's alright even if you don't forgive me. But will you listen to this audio over and over? Please! Because till you die... I couldn't find a way to apologize, Radhe. I love you, Radhe! Goodbye! I'm leaving this world happily. You have given me so much love that'll last for lives. But... I have nothing to give you. Except for sorry and thanks. This is what love is! Until sometime back... These men who wanted to kill me, are now the ones happily talking to me. Something my parents couldn't teach me... Something that I didn't find in any girl I fell in love with... That love, which even my Radhe couldn't make me understand... I understood what love meant when I hugged the guy who pointed a gun at me. Love isn't something that belongs to two sexes. It's something much bigger. We're all stuck inside the cages of religion, caste, race, and language. There's just one key to break out of all these cages. In whatever language it is said... That one word no one is tired of hearing... That one feeling... Is love! I knew nothing would happen to you. As long as I'm there... And until I die... I'll fight the God of death to bring you back. You may be Savithri... But I swear I'm not Sathayavan. Idiot! You are my butterfly! And... How did you escape? Your love saved me! Look at what your love has given me! But you are still a doofus! Why? You sent a WhatsApp note to my mom instead of me. Really?! I was just joking. But just be a doofus. That's what I like. It's been so many days since you called me pappali. Say it once. Radhe! 'Kaalangalil Aval Vasantham' [She's Springtime!] "Hey lottery, lottery babe!" "I want to live with you, my dear!" "For the day to bloom as a flower!" "You are the sweet cuckoo, my darling!" "You will be drizzled upon, my honey!" "I was born to live with you!" "The dream that took the form of a woman, Why does it rain today?" "As you pour upon the earth, My heart gets drenched!" "My love floats like raindrops, Is this even real?" "Like a dew drop, The silence melts away!" "Like the white clouds, I float and soar away!" "I grew, like crops ready for harvest!" "I'm the black and white Of the rain clouds!" "Shall I color you like a new rainbow?" "You performed magic in my heart!" "Everything looks so beautiful" "As I step foot in this dream world" "A breeze flows gently, Touching my heart!" "Hey lottery, lottery babe!" "I want to live with you, my dear!" "For the day to bloom as a flower!" "You are the sweet cuckoo, my darling!" "You will be drizzled upon, my honey!" "I was born to live with you!" "Oh my beloved! You are full of my heart!" "I bloomed like a silent flower" "Like the white clouds, I float and soar away!" "I grew, like crops ready for harvest!" "I'm the black and white Of the rain clouds!" "Shall I color you like a new rainbow?" "You performed magic in my heart!" "Everything looks so beautiful" "As I step foot in this dream world" "A breeze flows gently, Touching my heart!" "Hey lottery, lottery babe!" "I want to live with you, my dear!" "For the day to bloom as a flower!" "You are the sweet cuckoo, my darling!" "You will be drizzled upon!"
