We couldn't go out for three days it rained solidly every day. We didn't know what to do with ourselves Mari, why are you telling us this? Just a documentary report We asked a hotel employee for a top - A top? - Yes, you know? A spinning top painted with flags - We passed the time playing with it - Oh, really? - My husband's very good at it... - Really? Oh, really? You shouldn't flaunt it in front of the single girls How silly! We don't play with spinning tops, do we? We're not children, are we?

How can you say that? - What is it? - She has no right Right, I'm leaving Single people don't know what real happiness is They have no right to talk Look who's talking, Mrs Carrot! Single people have no say!

We always split into two groups... ...the married and the single - Aya got all worked up again - How come? Because the married ones look down on us for being single Why not get married, then? - You're on their side? - Of course Oh, dear! I'll think about it, then You should. How about the man Mr Satake suggested? He sounds nice Mr Satake speaks very highly of him Oh! You scared me! Were you awake all this time? She doesn't seem against the idea I know. I think it's a possibility She may accept. Try and ask her This cake tastes really good Is it? - I'll buy more next time - Please do Noriko can be stubborn so be tactful I know. Leave it to me Tell her that her father approves, but don't press her too much Don't worry Do your best, all right? Hello? - Hello? - Who is it? Hello. Long time no see Ah, Aunt Tami. Come in Very well. Thank you Sorry I haven't seen you for such a long time Where's Koichi's wife? She went shopping. Please make yourself comfortable Here's something for you from my hometown I hope you like it. It arrived this morning You're always very kind Oh, it's nothing We had a strange visitor this morning Oh? Who was it? I'd never seen him before A man with parted hair, glasses and a black bag At first, I thought he was from the tax office - But I was wrong - Who was he? He was from one of those reference agencies He asked me questions about Noriko Did he really? Then I realised that it must be about her marriage They're doing a background check - I asked him who was interested - Did you? He just scratched his head and tried to laugh it off I got so annoyed, I told him he'd never find a better girl I gave him what for! Oh, my! Turns out, that horrible little man knew quite a lot He even knew that both our sons were classmates... Oh, hello Welcome Thank you for being so kind to Kenkichi And how are you? I'm fine, thank you Your son has become a fine doctor Thank you, but all he does since his wife died is read books - It's been two years, hasn't it? - Yes. How time flies - What about your son Shoji? - He won't be coming back Some people have returned recently from the south I've given up hope There you go My wife still thinks he's alive somewhere I know how it is. You can't help it Every day, she listens to the Missing Persons Hour on the radio It's funny how our memories work I forget about recent things... ...yet I remember everything about Shoji so vividly He won't be coming home PHYSICIAN You were stationed in Zentsuji, right? That's right Ever hear of a man called Manabe? No. Who is he? Never mind - Sakaguchi was at Zentsuji - Was he really? He might know him. He knows a lot of people That's a stalemate position - Was this here? - No, it was there There are so many kids around here now It's extra noisy on Sundays My house is filled with them today I can't stay in that position Watch your legs! Careful! There it goes! More speed Here it comes! - Coming! - Almost! - Is this ready? - Yes, take it in What a crowd! Lunch, everyone Sandwiches for lunch! Sandwiches!

Her husband's going away on business. She really wanted to come I see... How inconvenient. If I were her, I'd have come It's not that simple for her She could have come. She has a maid to help her Maybe a wife has other worries - We single women wouldn't know - Right! Help yourself Kamakura is such a nice place I wish I could live here Noriko, phone call for you! - From Oiso - Is it? Hello? Takako? What is it? Really? I see... Takako just called. She's in Oiso Oiso? Her father's sick That's not true. He's on a trip, I read it in the newspaper Is that so? This party was her idea as well I wonder why she didn't come We've been dumped Because we're fussy, right? We were such close friends in school Now we're slowly drifting apart Can't be helped. That's how it is, it seems I can't bear it Shall we go to the beach later? Yes, shall we? - Have something to eat - Let's eat Pass me the juice This may be the happiest time for our family We'll be sad when Noriko leaves us to get married You're right What do you think of Mr Satake's plan? I hope it works out. It's time she got married How time flies Koichi got married, our grandchildren were born... ...and now Noriko's getting married This may be the happiest time of our lives You think so? But we'll still have happy times We mustn't ask for too much I've really enjoyed today Look Some child somewhere must be crying Remember how Koichi cried when he lost his balloon? Hello? Hello. Yes, it is - It's from home - Oh, thanks Hello? Fumiko? It's me I have to stay tonight to keep watch on a patient ls Noriko home? I see Her prospects seem very good.

That's so expensive! - Is it their usual price? - Yes I've lost my appetite Come on, pass me the plates I shouldn't have asked you The plates, the plates! I feel terrible. I shouldn't have asked you to buy it Will you pay for half of it? Me? Forget it - I will, I will! - You're serious? Here - It's so expensive, though - But this bakery is the best It costs as much as half a pound of wool But it's a rare occasion, I suppose - Good evening! - Who is it?

Not that often I wish I could - May I? - Please It must've cost a lot It was quite reasonable, right? It was cheap, so don't worry It's good Noriko, I believe congratulations are in order Really? So I've heard Really? How wonderful. What's the occasion? I'm right, aren't I? Maybe... - And you too, I hear - Me? - Your mother said so - That's just an idea in her head I think you should remarry. Shouldn't he? Yes, it would be good for little Mitsuko, too - I heard the lady's really nice - Mother's just getting all excited Are you not going to eat that? If not, I will - I certainly am! - Are you sure? Too bad It's so good Hide the cake What is it? Evening, Minoru I'm home Hi, Dad Hi, Dad Great! Look, Mum! Great!

My belt... The proposal for Noriko seems very promising That's very good Sakaguchi says the man is from a very good family in Zentsuji - He is the second son - Really? He's in the social register and seems to be a fine businessman I see. How nice. And how old is he? He was born in the 43rd year of the Meiji Era, so he's...42 - 42? - That's about right - Forties, huh? - He's that much older than Noriko? Age doesn't matter! - But that's too old for Noriko - That's right So what age is good? Noriko's not so young herself She can't be too choosy or she'll never get married As long as he's respectable, we shouldn't be picky I just feel sorry for her Sorry for her? Why? What do you mean? With that kind of attitude, you'll spoil things for Noriko - I wonder... - Yes, you will Aren't you asking for too much? You always do this - Yes, but... - But what? What does Noriko think? - You said she'd accept - Yes, but... Didn't you tell me that? - You said so - But it was you who... Idiot! Stop twisting things around! Am I asking for too much? What's wrong? He scolded me It's all right We're all just concerned for Noriko Don't worry about it Liar! Liar! I wanted train track, not that! Stop that! This stupid thing! Stop that! Why did you do that? You do not kick food around! Liar! That's a bad thing to do! - You understand? - Let me go! Isamu, come here! I'm home! Where are you going? Have you been scolded? - Where are you going? - I don't know I'm home Did you scold them again? You're in a bad mood You shouldn't scold them when you're angry - I feel sorry for them - Why? - They've grown scared of you - Don't lecture me I'm not lecturing you. You're always... Just mind your own business Very well - I'm home - Welcome back He's in a bad mood, isn't he? Idiot! Idiot! Isamu! Come on! Where can they be? Where, indeed?

They've asked me to run the internal medicine department at Akita Hospital - They asked you? - Yes The offer came through Mr Mamiya He told me I'd be called back to Tokyo in a few years What do you think? What do you think? I'd like to go. But I can always go on my own - You can't do that! - Will you come with me then? - How about it? - Well... It's far away Not keen? I'd get a big raise Can't you find a job like that in Tokyo? No, posts like that are only in the provinces Listen, Mother, it's a great opportunity for me I know that, but... And I can do my research on local problems there They promised I could return to Tokyo in three or four years I don't know when I might get another opportunity like this What do you think, Mother?

But nothing too expensive - Stingy! - Expensive dishes aren't always good Shall we go? - Good evening - Who is it? - It's me - Ah, Noriko? Welcome. Please come in Thanks - Mitsuko's fast asleep - Yes You're packing? I'm not making much headway, though This is a little farewell gift from my family Oh, you shouldn't have. You're very kind Thank you very much Where's Kenkichi? Still at his farewell party even though he's off tomorrow When will you join him? As soon as I finish cleaning this place up It must be hard work Thanks for all your kindness over the years - Is this your first trip to Akita? - Yes The furthest north I've been is Utsunomiya I see You'll be back in a few years That's what Kenkichi says, too - It's true - I hope he's right I wanted him to get remarried... ...and then we could live the rest of our lives here Actually... I hope you won't be offended, and please don't tell Kenkichi - What is it? - Well... I know it's an impossible dream... ...but I just wish Kenkichi had got married to someone like you - That's what I thought - Really? I'm sorry. It's just a wish in my heart Please don't be angry with me - Do you mean it? - What? Do you really feel that way about me? Forgive me, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings You wouldn't mind an old maid like me? Then I accept - Really? - Yes - You mean it? - Yes Are you sure? You really mean it? How happy I am! You really mean it? This is so wonderful Thank you so much! Thank goodness I mentioned it, or this would never have happened See? Sometimes it's good that I talk so much Oh, I am so happy! I feel so relieved Noriko, let's have some red-bean buns No, thank you. I ought to go now Why? Please wait a little. Kenkichi will be home soon But it's already so late Very well - Can I really believe it? - Yes - You promise? Are you sure? - Yes How happy I am! - Goodbye - Goodnight And thank you. Thank you - Welcome back - Thanks for last night - When's your train tomorrow? - It's the 8:45 to Aomori - Well, goodnight - Goodnight I'm home Um you see News'? Did she say anything? Nothing in particular Listen, she said she'd join our family She promised she would You see, I told her what's been on my mind It was good that I did. I didn't think she'd accept - What's this about? - She'll join our family - What for? - What do you mean, "what for"? She's agreed to marry you, to become your wife ' My Wife? ' Yes! Isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy for you I'm absolutely overjoyed! You must be happy too. I'm really glad for you - Then stop crying - I can't help it If you're happy, then show it You are happy, aren't you? - Yes, I'm happy - Then don't hold back. Show it! What an odd boy you are! Is Noriko back yet? I heard her come in a few minutes ago - Father - What is it? - You too, Mother - What? Please come downstairs - What is it? - Please sit down - Well? - Noriko wants to marry Yabe Kenkichi? Yes. She says she promised his mother just now But he's leaving for Akita tomorrow morning That's why I decided This is important. Have you given it careful consideration? He has a child, too We've all been concerned about you getting married You must've known that Why didn't you at least talk to father and mother? Have you thought this through? You acted rashly I don't know about father and mother, but I don't like this match But I... When his mother talked to me, I didn't feel a moment's hesitation I suddenly felt that I'd be happy with him That's why I accepted Are you sure you won't be sorry later? I don't think so Are you positive you won't regret this later? - I'm sure - You're sure? Absolutely sure? I'm sure Don't you feel chilly, dear? Shall we go back to bed? Let's go back to sleep It was thoughtless of her to decide on her own She acts like she grew up all by herself What should we do? Should we let her? Why not? It's her own decision Maybe something can still be done What could we do now? She's made up her mind You know how she is Yes? There's a visitor for you in reception All right - Thanks for seeing him off - I'm glad that he got a seat He couldn't have stood all the way to Akita - He's lucky - What brings you here? - The station was too crowded to talk - About what? I couldn't possibly ask you with all those people around... ...but I kept thinking about it after we parted - What is this about? - About last night I still can't believe it. It feels like it was a dream Did your parents approve? - Yes - And your brother? - Don't worry - Really? They approved? Wonderful, wonderful But what does Kenkichi think? Kenkichi? He's overjoyed. He didn't sleep a wink last night We ate again in the middle of the night Really? I'll live a nice long life, thanks to you I feel so relieved now Well, I'll be going now. I'm so happy! - This is the way out - Oh, is it? On, I'm so happy! Fumi, can you pull it from that end? I wonder if she did the right thing, deciding on her own I wonder too She didn't have to marry someone with a child You're right Maybe she doesn't mind... ...but it's a pity there was nothing we could do I always thought... ...ever since she left school... ...every time I heard people compliment her... ...I wondered what kind of family she'd marry into You know Mrs Shinoda from Denen-Chofu? Yes Whenever I visited her beautiful home... ...I dreamed Noriko would be a wife in such a smart house one day I'm sure Now I think Mr Satake's man might've been a better choice I agree I don't understand young people nowadays Are you going out? To buy some seed for the canaries I'll see him out - Do you want me to get anything else? - No See you later So you've already decided? It was all very sudden. When's your wedding? We'll discuss it when he returns from Akita in a few months You've taken a big step I didn't think you were the type who could ever leave Tokyo Why? I imagined you'd live Western-style, with a flower garden... ...listening to Chopin And in your tiled kitchen, you'd have a refrigerator filled with Coca-Cola I thought you'd be a wife in a house like that And when I'd visit, you'd meet me on a covered porch... ...wearing a white sweater, playing with a Scottish terrier... ...and you'd greet me over a hedge, "Hello, how are you?" - Not at all - I couldn't imagine otherwise Akita is farm country, right? - Will you wear farmer's clothes? - Of course "Awright my luvva? "Proper nice weather we been havin', eh?" Can you talk like that? "Reckon I can awright. Tis easy" "Well, I be! "You come up 'ere from the big city and already talk our dialect "You don't look local, but you talk local" "if I's gonna live in Akita when me man an' I tie the knot... ..."then reckon I shud learn the dialect" You speak it so well! A girl from Akita went to our school So that's why! Do you remember... ...before your brother Shoji left for the front... ...we went hiking with him and a friend? Is he the man? I don't remember if he was with us Did you like him then? I had no particular feelings for him - When did it start? - I don't know. It happened gradually Really? I had no idea Of course not. I never imagined myself marrying him So what happened? - It was just by accident - Accident? Well, that's not entirely true. How can I explain it? It's like when you look for something all over the place... ...and then you find it was right in front of you all along My mother always looks for her glasses when they're on her nose - That's how it was - How so? He was so close at hand, I didn't realise he was the one So you did love him No, it wasn't like I was in love with him I'd known him well since childhood, and I knew I could trust him That means you love him No, it's different. It's the feeling of being totally at ease with him Don't you understand? If that's not being in love, what is? - No, it's not - Yes, it is You've fallen in love with him - You're in love - Am I? Yes, you are. Don't make me hit you! - You better not. I know how you hit - Right! - Grab her, Mother! - What's going on here? - Aya, where's that thing? - What thing? The thing I brought up the other day. It's about this big, and yellow I was sure I'd left it here somewhere - Madam, you're wanted - Oh, all right - What's she looking for? - I don't know She's always like that. She'll be back, anyway I wonder if she's getting senile I can't leave home to get married with her like that Wouldn't your husband live here with you? No way. No real man would live with his wife's family See? And she usually comes back once more Really? I'm happy for you. You're lucky you found a man you love I'm sure our new life together won't be easy There will be a lot of difficulties and inconveniences to deal with I'll have to scrimp and work really hard - And what about your boss's plan? - I declined this morning What did he say? He laughed that I was old-fashioned for a modern girl That's funny. He's upstairs right now And Mr Manabe's with him Why not take a peek from the next room? - No - Come on, it'll be fun - He's quite good-looking - No Come on. Why not? It'll be all right No, I'd rather not. I don't need any more husbands Don't worry. Come on I may marry whoever's left. Let's go! - We shouldn't - It's fine! - Let's not - Come on! I wonder if we should give her our blessing She's impossible I just don't know I feel sorry for her Let's talk to her again and make sure Maybe we should She said she's decided, but she might have second thoughts I'm back! - I'm home. Sorry I'm late - Welcome home - I went to see Aya - Did you? Have you eaten? I'll fix myself something. Don't bother. I'll help myself - There are some leftover croquettes - Good. Thanks Thanks for the food Are you worried because I'm marrying a man with a child? - That's one reason - Please don't be worried - I'm not worried - But mother feels sorry for you I saw her crying in the kitchen last night But I love children Father and mother don't see it the same way as you do Mitsuko will grow up, and what happens when you have your own child...? It'll be fine. I've given it a lot of thought It'll be all right The situation's not that unusual. I'm sure I can manage - But... - Don't you worry, Sister - I'm confident I can do it - Is that so? That's all right, then Maybe I'm an optimist Being without money doesn't worry me like it does other people I'm fine with it - Are you sure? - Yes I'll stop worrying, then Frankly, I felt I couldn't trust a man... ...who was still unattached and drifting around at 40 I think a man with a child is more trustworthy - I admire you, Noriko - Why? I knew nothing about marriage when I got married But what will become of the family when I leave home? You needn't worry about that Your father and mother only want you to be happy So don't worry But it'll be harder for you without me It'll be fine. You and I can compete from now on - At what? - Economising - And I don't intend to lose - Neither do I You'll have to stop eating shortcake Of course! It's too expensive But if we're given some, I'll eat it Come on, it's lovely down here! I'm glad you came Congratulations Thank you for everything over all these years No, I should thank you Shall we call Aya and go out for dinner? Well, thank you for asking, but I really must be going I see Well, do stop by if you ever come up to Tokyo Thank you very much And take good care oi your husband Manabe will probably be disappointed, but tough luck If I were younger and single and proposed to you, would you accept? You'd turn me down too? Hey, come and take a good look at Tokyo Tokyo's not so bad Putting it back on? - I can't decide - Leave it off Please look towards me Keep still, lsamu Madam, chin down a little, please Ready, everyone? - Thank you - Thank you Could you take one more picture of my mother and father? - Good idea - Really? All right Very well You look wonderful together - Don't make fun of us - It's been years since the last time - I'm finished - Me, too You've eaten everything up! Where are you going, lsamu? To poo Thanks for the meal Now you're marrying Yabe, I wish I hadn't sent him to Akita But knowing he was leaving made me realise how I felt about him Three or four years will pass in no time Yes, it'll go quickly We've lived in this house for 16 years already That's right It was spring and Noriko had just left primary school That's right. She was just a little older than Minoru is now She used to wear a ribbon in her hair... ...and she was always singing She was so cute Children grow up so quickly - What will you do now, Koichi? - I'm going to start a practice here - Really? - And what about your hospital post? I'll keep working there in the evenings I see... Well...we're parting ways, but we'll be together again I wish we could live together forever... ...but that's impossible Father and Mother, you must visit us now and then from Yamato I'm sorry, it's all my doing No, it's not your fault. It was inevitable Noriko, please take good care of your health I hear Akita's very cold Yes, you must take care and keep healthy Then we'll be sure to get together again Hey, look there A bride is passing by I wonder what sort of family she's marrying into I wonder how Noriko is Our family's been scattered But you and I, we've done quite well We've experienced a lot in our years together We shouldn't ask for too much We've been so happy THE END
