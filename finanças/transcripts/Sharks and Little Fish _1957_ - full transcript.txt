Sharks and Little Fish 1957 haie und kleine fische It is a rainy day in the middle of war. Four naval cadets go aboard an auxiliary minesweeper. I had to follow all of this. - Where's Albatroz? - On the port side. - I hope it's not five kilometers from here. This is your first combat action. Like the weather, the reception is cold and hostile. - Is this Albatross? - That's right, here we are waiting for you. - Aspirants. - Where's your commander? He is wearing a clean shirt to greet him with dignity. - Let's say we're here. - Camp? - Down there, go slowly. - Is the whole crew here? - Where did they dig you up, baby? - What do you mean? - Well, where are you from? - From Böbling. - And what's your name? - "Birds" Come on, you comedian. - Good taste. - Thanks. - I'm Stolenberg. Emil Stolenberg. We just finished the receiver. - What is your name? - Like my father. If you are so rude, I will give you one immediately. I prefer to be more afraid of your grandmother, you rattle. Look, I don't give you a... Let's go. I am Teichmann. - Smell it. stinks of graveyard. You already go to the ground, take note, You see! What's going on here? What are these types? You probably don't consider it necessary to report to the first officer, do you? - Naval cadet Heyne reports on the ship. - Take off that "beret". Did you hear me or have your ears plugged? I listen well and wash my ears every morning, Lieutenant. The Lord is an academic. And to play sports, take three laps on the deck. I will kick your bat's audacity. What are you waiting for? Should I bring you a wheelchair? Don't you want to take your bag? Or should I take it for you? It's still the same. I have this forever on my Albatross. Why are you upset? You volunteered. Yes. What are we doing today? The soldier is suffering on Sunday. He has nothing to do. I'm going to the movies, I'm getting a little polite. - I'm too lazy for that. - Let's go sailing. You can't help it. It's not a bad idea. I wonder what our first trip will be like. It's going to be very hard. Laziness, you can sleep the whole war. Play with the boats in the bathtub, idiots! At least you woke up. Cows behave as if they are on an ocean liner. Today, this kitten needs to be brilliant. 1? - Yea? - Assign a crew to clean the ship! - I will. So I'll check everything in person, so that desolate action learns what purity is. Do this, number one. Yes wait. Who sailed with number 22 last night? Get out! Well, will it be? Officers, waiters! This is what I must have thought. And which one of you was in charge? - Me, lieutenant. - Who am I? - Naval Cadet Stolenberg. - Get involved. - So it was you? - What did I do? - What did you do? The fleet commander will tell you personally. Get ready for a few days down. What else are you perched here for? Autumn! Change your clothes and inform the commander! Do you know women? How, please, captain? - If you're good with women, I ask. - Captain, I think... - You must be confusing me, I'm Teichmann. I... - Cadet Naval Teichmann. Teichmann naval cadet. I should be punished, but I don't know... Be careful. Last night you insulted two ladies who passed you on a speedboat. Then. Yes, captain. But they were very little pigs. - What? - So they sailed without regulation, Captain. - Then? - Yes. The sailboat took precedence over the motorboat, and they were speeding. They should have slowed down. But there were two stupid geese on the boat, ladies. One of them was the portkeeper's wife. By chance. And that is why the report came. You were unlucky. Well, what am I going to do with you? - What service do you have this afternoon? - Cleaning the boat. And then go away. To learn how to treat women, you will introduce yourself to my lady in the afternoon and help her furnish my service apartment. You may have to bring a few more things out of town. Wear a hiking uniform and have a written pass. - Report to my apartment at three, right? - I will, captain. - Are you waiting for me? - I wish. I'm waiting for my boss's old man. - This is me. Good morning. - Hello, lady. Do you always whistle like that when you greet someone? No, not really, but... Well, come on. Thanks. - The password is "bottle mail". - I remember this. Have a nice day, lady. Will you allow it? Come here. Nails! Let's go! They could be cleaner, you have sadness behind them. Take off the lid! Do you need a medical certificate to finally go to the barber? Put the caps on! Remember when you accompany the lady you have to be out of the box, understand? - You understood me? - Yes, Lieutenant. - A handkerchief? - Can we finally go? But of course, madam. I'll just check the man's exterior, I have to... - I've done this. - Yes ma'am. - Let's go. What do my inflamed eyes see? Look, Hans with the commander's old man. Dude, it's a cat. This is exactly what the doctor ordered. - The body will work. - You are crazy? - You probably jumped. You will have a break when you hang it. - What a pity. - Why? Your service will end in a few minutes. - Then you would work in your spare time. - This is not work. - But? Could you give me a screwdriver, please? - What did you do again? - Sorry to talk to you like that, but... - It increases your confidence, doesn't it? - It might be. - I mean, the curtain fell. - Then he slipped a second time. - Master, I... - I was flirting, because if I don't finish today, then... - Thanks for the great idea. - So you don't get me wrong. I can't ask for a helper tomorrow. - And why not? - Because it does not work. I have to make dinner, my husband will be here soon. Don't worry about me, in the worst case I will be on a boat. Are you so young or so cheeky? So young, lady. Year eighteen, especially sparkling. - And not yet fermented. - True, but better every day. Where are you at home, Teichmann? In the dorm. The father is no longer alive and the mother remarried. Yes, and now it's suspended. You are really useful. Don't you want a cigarette before you leave? Thank goodness, thank you. Is that you? The husband doesn't approve, he doesn't like it. He doesn't think it suits me. First, he doesn't see it, and second, a cigarette suits any pretty woman. And third, it stays between us. Good. Husband... - To edit. - Yea? Hey darling. I have bad news. The port commander, my officers and the ladies will visit tomorrow night. - Unfortunately, I couldn't postpone it. - I'll do my best. Teichmanne. - How does a cigarette on duty taste? - I have two minutes after the service. Just listen to him, he's the most brazen guy in my club. - But the curtains can fall well. - Defend him again. - Can you mix a bowl? - Bowls? Yes, I would like to help you with that. You will have a lot of work until tomorrow. - Bowle is my specialty. - But I mean stir, don't drink. I will, captain. Madam, is it well mixed? I'm right at the top, because I'm still proving it. - Sour. It tastes like vinegar. - It's not a problem. - You exaggerated. - Not at all, that's all. Please turn the board over or release a new one, right? You are seriously incorrigible. How far are you with that bow? Done. I think it's excellent. Try this. I suspect you never mixed a bowl. I can't argue with that. You said it was your specialty. I lied. I wanted to come again. Go away, Teichmann. immediately! So, am I playing or not? Okay, I just don't know where Hans Teichmann is. - I haven't seen him all night. - I'll go get him. - She is very beautiful, isn't she? - Who? - Don't ask a fool. Here you go, calm down. - Drink your beer yourself. Promise me, Gerde. Let's go. Minesweeper Candles. Carefree expectations are mixed with the fear hidden in the cadets' hearts. What will it be like when you start at once? - Emil is an animal lover. - What do you mean? - He feeds fish, you know, right? But you have forums, I hope I laugh. - I'm better now. - We'll see how long. Attention, gentlemen, Pauli is coming, greet him, at least once a day. - Should that be a greeting? - Yes, Lieutenant. Do this again. - What is it? - Air alarm. - Everyone in position! - Should I greet you again? - Shut up! - Leave him alone. - What's your name, man? - Cadet Naval Vögele! - Birds. - Damn, it's still a long way. - He's spying, keeping out of reach. Tear your shirt. You must not shoot without command. You should have known this a long time ago. - What if he gets closer? - He won't come. See, it's spinning. - Same. - He was an explorer. - Get out of combat positions! Get back on course! - Return to the course. Vögele! They sent you to me for a report. They say you treated Lieutenant Paul with disrespect. - What you think? - Nothing, Lieutenant. And what did you say to Lieutenant Pauli? I didn't say anything to Lieutenant Paul, I just told my friend Teichmann that he was scary. Dude, you must be crazy. How can you say something like that about a superior? - Can you say something about your apology? - No, Lieutenant. Or did you mean out of fear, not Lieutenant Pauli, but one of his friends? No, my friends are fine. You must have been really upset, right? I? Not at all, but Pauli was dialed, driving like an angry dog. God, you have strange expressions. Try to speak like a villain once too. - Cadet Naval Heyne, let me speak. - What's wrong with you? When people in southern Germany say that someone is scared, it means something upset, nervous, upset in our north. - That's what Vögele meant. - And so? It will be like that, but it was not me who was called, but Lieutenant Pauli. I'm going to speak to Lieutenant Paul before I arrest him. Dude, are you really that stupid or are you just kidding? I love it when other people get involved in a conversation. You are really the biggest idiot I have ever met. Plane, plane! What the hell are we waiting for? - Pal. - Finally. - Guy. Okay, bro, you shot him in the ass. - He fell like a pear! - Congratulations, you gave it to him. - That's right, isn't it? - It was like butter. - You have to have lynx eyes. - Congratulations... I would like them to come back so I can get one too. - Teichmann, wait a minute. - Good morning. - Good. - You go to the boiler room for two weeks. - How? Punishment for wrong greeting. Order of Lieutenant Pauli. Pauli? He has nothing to command. I will complain to the commander. Feel free to go, but you're out of luck. - Yes. - Until the new commander arrives, Lieutenant Pauli will represent him. You understand - I understand. - I have to pass orders, nothing more. - I understand. I throw so much coal into the boiler that it explodes. Try it, but don't forget that you will be closer to the boiler when it explodes. Just make up. That's because you didn't greet our Mr. Pauli badly enough. He can kiss my ass. It won't kill me. And you take the bullshit, idiot, and you better get me some coffee. Come here. Alarm! - The fleet commander reports a rapid boat attack, Lieutenant. - Where? - Where? - Right there! Three pieces to starboard. - We have to sound the alarm. - Yes. Hurry, sound the alarm. - I will. - You have to turn around to join them. - Why? I will turn the ship... Rotate the ship to reduce the target area, or a torpedo will take us down. We're getting out of here before we cook here. Put it on my back. Close the partitions! Move, close all partitions! I gave the order, Lieutenant. - Signal for the command ship. The torpedo hit, the ship falling quickly. - I will. What are you waiting for? Get out of here now! He is not sure that we will sink if the partitions last. I did not ask your opinion! We're falling, you can see that, right? - For now, we're just tilting. - I have to go to the boiler room. - You are crazy? I'm asking for permission to go to the boiler room. Teichmann is there. Dude, I'm going to throw you overboard if you don't follow the order. At full power! - There are still people in the boiler room. Let the partition open. - No. - I would like to say... - No, I said! Do you have clogged ears? HQ message: '' Fleet Commander to the ship's commander, we are reaching the side. '' Finally. It's not possible. It is closed. These pigs locked us here. Teichmann is down there, you know? Teichmann is my friend. - He can't leave, I have to go after him. - Autumn! If they are not here soon, we will roast here like a Christmas goose. Open it! Hansi, hurry up, get out. Cook first, he's hurt. What's going on down here, huh? - What are you doing here? - We pulled the three. Why did you leave the bridge? I ask you, why did you leave the bridge? You refused to obey the order. This is pure disobedience to order! - They cook there if we... - I don't care, man. - They would scream there, Lieutenant. - Keep your mouth shut. I will send you to court martial. What are you doing? - Hansi! Stop! - I'm going to kill you, son of a bitch. The fleet commander is on board. This is going to be expensive, Teichmann. Chief helmsman of Karls, supervisory officer. - Loï can't maneuver, we were hit... - I see. - Where's Lieutenant Pauli? - I do not know. He just left the bridge. What are these ways? All right... Captain, I must report a serious breach of discipline, I was... Where's your hat? The wind is not blowing, she couldn't fly with you. - I don't know, Captain. - Do you report anything besides a violation of discipline? - Yes, we were hit by a torpedo, I think... - I think so, Lieutenant. What did you think of becoming the only ship in the fleet to port? You couldn't do more stupid things. The blind boats must have seen the fast boats. - Yes, I saw them too. - And? - Prepare the tow ropes at the bow. - I will, captain. I am waiting for your answer! - Which is? - Water ticket removed, captain. - Partitions? - Closed and on hold. And then you signal that the ship is sinking. I don't see anything like that. - I was afraid that... - Yes, you were really scared. And then just run away from the bridge! You will no longer enter the bridge in my fleet. I will let you be replaced by incompetence. You can spend your days on land for me. Take note. What do you want to report for breach of discipline? Nothing, it doesn't matter now. It does not matter anymore. - Hansi! - Yea? - Are we going to see the Dora girls tonight? - What's wrong with your girls? - Dora is the best of them. Your Dora was stolen from me. There is something for you too, baby. - Hope so. - Which is? Since when do you carry suitcases? It belongs to the commander, I have to take it to his apartment. Wait a minute, I used to wear this on my watch chain. Dear guy, I have to say this. - I think he's practicing pucfleka. - The work is noble, boy. I prefer to stay a mess. Sorry, I'm carrying luggage... Please. - Which is? - I would like you to forgive me, my lady, my... I know I shouldn't, shouldn't... - But... I was so... - Drunk. That's what you mean, isn't it? You don't have to ask for forgiveness. - I never take drunks seriously. - I wasn't drunk. None of us were drunk. Are you still proud of what you did? Are you always so intrusive? You probably treat women like that all the time, but if I told my husband then... You don't have to worry about telling him. You are just a baby to me. Here we go. Welcome to the Dóøina luxury salon. Whoever forgets never knew what a home is. At home, the boy could not be happy or satisfied. This attracted him to the world, somewhere to the south. He just cheated on his own happiness, or left his girlfriend at home... Come on boy. He wants courageous happiness. Emile, this is a business, isn't it? - Cheers, Teichmann, beat the commanders. - How do you know? It will break fast, dear. You can go far to the marina. Yes. If you honk the horn even more, they'll shoot me tomorrow. - Stay with us, word of honor. - We'll see how long. The same thing again. Where is Dora trapped? Fat man, where's Dora? - She's taking a break. - I like it very much. - What do you want from her? - You can guess three times. - What's your name, little one? - Birds. Like a bird? This name can be changed for money. - Do you have any practical suggestions? - We'll see what can be done. - You will dance all night. Aren't you thirsty? - Of course I do. So say something, dear. - Hi, Gerd! - Hi, Dora. - Yea. That you will appear too. You're getting more beautiful, girl. And you're getting funnier. He's my smartest friend, - He's always philosophizing with me. - Then... No '' then, then ''. What are you? I'm sorry, Dora, this is Hans Teichmann, friend. Good manners forgotten at home, huh? I didn't know that there were many demands for decent behavior in your home. - Freie, Hans, so as not to disturb Dora. - Let him go, the milkmen are going for a walk today. They drink and chatter, which makes their throats want, so that they feel a little more mature. You see, Gerd, he’s quieter and tighter immediately. Bored, that's the right word. Why did you take this guy with you. You know I hate these cheeks. I told you. He is a friend and only knows who Schopenhauer was. Many people think that he was a gauleiter. Everyone knows that Schopenhauer is a composer. Dora, I prefer to be okay, okay? He was a philosopher who wrote a book against women, and he was the one who said: '' To call the fair sex short, shallow shoulders, wide hips and short legs, only a male intellect with a male motivation could be sexually instigated. '' - Idiot. - Well, he didn't know you. - You will return? - I have to take care of the guests a little. - But he'll be back soon. - I will not go until the green man disappears. You can't ask her to understand a philosopher who hated women. - You can't ask anyone that. - We'll see. Now I'm going to talk to those idiots here. - Gerd, you're always drunk. - It is not me. I just want to say something to these idiots. Stay here, you will not always stand. Now I'm talking to those idiots of the soul. Listen, you poop. I quote Arthur Schopenhauer... - Heyne jumped. - Keep your balance, Gerd! Just the sight of a sad female figure already says that a woman is not destined for great spiritual or bodily performances. Gerd, you can't talk to women at a bar like this. Of course I can, you heard it yourself. Shoot now. And you hear what Schopenhauer says next: "With nature, the woman created, what dramaturgy calls the sudden effect. '' - You pig! - I won't let you offend. Look, this is my friend. Stop! Stop, stop, damn it, I'm talking! Stop it, damn it! Stop! What is wrong with you? You're always bleeding, man! Damn it, get out! Here, come on, wash up, man. - Which woman stepped in your eye? - Why? Just don't do that. When a guy acts like you, then the woman let him go, and the woman the young man loves so much, right? There is nothing wrong with that. Nekecej. I know you. - You are not the first to forget. - Who wants to forget? I know, it hurts. Don't play the merciful sister. But I don't mean this pain, but this one. And I have the right medicine for you. The fleet is transferred to France. Ships must cross the channel. Two degrees on the port side. Neuchatel lighthouse, captain. - We'll be there in a minute. - Yes, captain. - That would be good. I'm going to take a nap. Watch out for me here. - I will. - Calm guard. - Take a break, Captain. - 18. - Yes. - 20. - Two. - Dude, I'm done, I have a family. - Zero? - 4? - 7? - 30. - Dog. Now daddy is going to show you how to win a big one without four. - He's losing. Against. - What, do you have all four against it? - I'll hang it on your nose. - Lost. See what I found in the Vogel cubicle. He writes poems secretly. '' Beauty is the meaning of every being. Right first... '' I mean... '' At first, she poured serious wrinkles of false shame from the veined loins, it sparked raw joy, ignited desire and desire, she lit the fireworks of a delicious instinct. '' The guy writes poems and doesn't even speak German properly. I think it is a very good poem. Of course, and Vögele is a very kind lyric soul. You must not drop everything immediately. You are an intelligent beast and, of course, do not know what true feelings are. Come on, read on. "I can't believe the little death, that we look over our shoulder every day, we will remain concerned and needy. I do not believe that we are in serious danger. I'm still alive, I have time to build, my blood is redder than red roses... '' What's the matter with you? Do you have a lock on the lock? Let's play. Take it out. Hurry, let's get him out. Damn cowards. Shit, ugly pigs... Captain... Loï L is no longer reporting. I wonder where our fighters are. We request air support, the torpedo boats are leaving. What is the point? Now all that's left is Albatross, the command ship. If he stays in the dark, he must be safe. Hopefully. We're diving! Hansi! - Everyone get off the ship! - Everyone get off the ship! - Move, jump up! - Everyone get off the ship! - Dude, Hans, what is it? - You bitch! Stay down, Hans, we're playing lifeboats. We will go for you. Teichmanne! Teichmanne! Hansi! Didn't you see Teichmann? - Let's go. - Hold tight. - Didn't you see Teichmann? - I saw him fall from the ship. Captain! Damn job. Shut up. I don't scream either. I put myself! Leave me finally, you idiot! My eyes are burning terribly, damn salt water. Why are you doing this? Who are you? - It is better? - Who are you? - Teichmann. - Good... - Gerde. - Yea? - Something is floating in front. It is a piece of destruction. And Hans! Movement, rhythm. Guys, take it with you. Hansi, let's go. Move faster. Come on, guys, even closer, more. Get the hell out of you. Hans, give me your hand. People, walk, hurry up. To hold on. Take it! Polez! So hurry up, damn it. Submarine! Here we are! - Careful, stay away from your side! - Throw me a rope, I'll get it. So do this, take it. Movement. This one is hurt, be careful, be careful. Be careful, take it down. Be careful, slowly. Good. - Come on, take it with you. - Yea. Careful. Squeeze. Erich, old man, it's me, Lüttke. - Who? Johann Lüttke? - Yea. Dude, you? I'm bothering you, aren't I? I liked to emerge because of you. That we're meeting right here. Everything will be fine again. He will have to do this, for Edit's sake. You were there when we got married. - I'll send a message to her. - Fine. - Now try to fall asleep a little, okay? - Yea. He looks like an Arab, a Bedouin in a turban, you know, but it suits him. - How's he doing? It's bad? - What's on your mind? Just don't be afraid, a little salt water for him... ... she messed up her face a little. Erichu. Honey. I heard you coming, I recognized you from the steps. So, what's up with Wegner? I'm sorry, but I won't say anything definitive. - I can't operate it. - Why not? I'm not an expert. He has to go to an eye clinic in Germany. The case is more complicated. He kept me afloat all night. He even gave me his own life jacket. If it weren't for Teichmann, I would be finished. Follow him. It must be somewhere. And tell him that I hope to see you soon. Take the flowers with you. He likes them more now than I do. Thank you, Teichmann. This is Teichmann, he saved her husband's life. - Let's go after Erich. - Yea. To edit. Stay. You need to clean your bed better. The team doctor wants the blanket to be perfectly smooth. - I'll do it, sister. - Fine. This also applies to you. He is well. - Hi sister. - Good morning. Who are you going after? Hello, we would like to see Mr. Teichmann. What do you have in your bags? Please note that the team doctor strictly prohibits the delivery of alcohol and... - I see, alcohol. Do you know anything about alcohol? - No. It's lingerie, sister, lingerie for girlfriend. We are going on vacation and we have to bring something from France. - Is there something wrong with you, sister? - Such that? Hansi. Dude, are you still alive? You can't even kill yourself, can you? - No, you were looking forward to it. - How are you? When I see your round face, Emil, wonderful. - What have you been doing all the time? - We have a new steamship, we are cruising the Canal and looking for mines. - They already took us to the naval school. - Congratulations, me too. Well, I'm going crazy. So the old club is together again? - And he brought something for you. - What is it? Laundry? It depends on what is under it. Damn it! But don't drink tonight, store it well. - The team doctor is coming for a visit. - God. - We better get out. - For now! - And now let's drink for the health of our new toasters! - Thanks Dad. The most beautiful Christmas present, those ensign ferrets, huh? - Health! - Cheers, General! - Cheers, uncle! - Health! I have a feeling this is the last Christmas of war. The Führer certainly knows what he is doing. Until now, he has always proven to be a brilliant military leader. - Just take the campaign to France. - Let's go. - The German General Staff is also involved in this, right? - I don't deny that. Anyway, we have France in our pocket. And England will follow. - I need a cigarette now, Emil. - Yes of course. I think the shit inside you is just as irritating to me as it is to me. They believe in God and money, but in reverse order. It seems to work wonderfully well. Daddy. - Do not sit. And you serve us a little more. - You're a good one. My son told me that you volunteered for the submarines. Yes, but unfortunately Gerd is going to another one. Man, the three ensigns on a submarine, that would be a little weird. - We've always been together. - Let's drink for this. I wish you and survive the war in good health, - and it doesn't matter how it ends. Health! - Cheers, professor. Thank you teacher. To finish soon. I am an old man and have been teaching history for thirty years. I do not believe that this war will end as we wish. linen, but that's not a theme for Christmas Eve, I think. - Are you going to bed, dad? - Yes, it will be better this way. I don't feel as strong and sure of victory as my relatives. Goodnight. - Good night, Father. - Good evening, Professor. - Hurry, Emil, fall, get a snout. - You don't have to call me twice. And I have another special Christmas surprise for you. - For me? - They sent it here from the naval school. The sender is Edit Wegner. Gerde! She invited me. Her, what about her husband? - They should release you from the clinic at Christmas. - Don't forget that you have to go to France tomorrow. Yes, but I'm going for the next vacation. Health! Submarine base in France. We have an interesting kitten. The greatest fortress of the fleet is the commander, the greatest elegant is the first officer, after all, the royal prince, but he doesn't like to hear. Address him simply by the post. And the biggest bum in the fleet is our chief engineer, but only on the outside. - Stay away from me, friend. - It is clear. - I'm asking the lieutenant for permission to pass. - Just go. I'm sorry, Lieutenant, we didn't know you. Nothing. My name is Wächter, but I am not a wächter on the track. - I work as a top heater. It's visible, isn't it? - Yea. I warmly welcome you. The first officer is over there. Movement! - Good morning. Ensign Stolenberg. - Teichmann. I am happy to welcome you on our cruise. Unfortunately, the first class cabins are already sold out, but we have two bathrooms on board. Here is an academic personally. Doctor of Philosophy Timmler, war correspondent assigned to the ship. I am very happy to meet some educated people here, very nice, nice. The commander is coming on board! Crew, watch out! Proceed! A war correspondent, a civilian expert, Dr. Timmler reports on board. - Come back! - How please? - Inverted March! - Are you cold in the neck? - What do you mean? - Aren't you cold in the neck? - I do not realize. Get the wave cut. - Who's in the haircut? - Mohre mechanical torpedo tower. - And he will come. - Mohre mechanical torpedo boat! - Mohre mechanical torpedo boat! Ensign Teichmann reports the war school on board. Ensign Stolenberg reports the war school on board. - Freeman Mohre announces his arrival. - Come back! - I will, captain! - When? - Immediately, captain. - Can I turn around again? - You may. Shouldn't we greet the old man in particular before bringing the goods? Okay, let's go. - What's wrong with you? - We also want to thank you for getting us out of the water then. This is completely unnecessary and not prescriptive. Match! Pull your abdomen. Get out again. Get out a little more. Smile, boys, at the home front. Are you kneeling before, Dr. Timmler? No, captain, but they will look bigger. This is none of your business. Sea water softens the skin and favors beard growth. Yes, Lieutenant. Will you probably have to sacrifice another card? yea. In fact, I feel sorry for the good old Völkischer Beobachter. I still wonder what he will say: '' Our enemies capitulated. '' Air alarm! Alarm! Time. - Flood the chambers! - Flood three or three! Why are we really falling? Replace the fuses. Slow motion. - Do your teeth hurt? - No, captain. - Minus ten! Both machines at full power! The Lüttek submarine has been searching the tropical waters for weeks. No trace of the enemy. God, this heat will destroy me. Just so you know, I have more sensitive nerves than others, I'm a writer. Among us, the commander's style is terrible. The term 'while' can only be used if two events are taking place at the same time. He can't write, '' While we have tropical heat, a freshwater manufacturer has abandoned it. '' There is no heat in the heat. Instead, he should write: "When it was tropical heat," right? For example, I could say, '' While I scrambled my finger on my nose, I take a handkerchief out of my pocket with my other hand. '' Upon hearing you, I realized that you were an ox. Is this right? Yes, captain. I'm a pain now. Commander, clouds of smoke at 40 degrees. Head of the helmsman, send a radiogram. Prepare for a subsurface attack. Prepare for immersion. In position. - Teichmann, check the torpedo chambers. - I will. Drain five hundred liters! Three hundred fall forward. Now hell is going to start. Dovnitø. Both machines at full power! Go to 80 degrees! - Dive! - Dive! Prepare chambers one to four for underground shooting. Prepare chambers one through four for underground shooting. Prepare chambers one through four for underground shooting. Flood one. - Chambers one through four ready? - Chambers one through four ready? - Prepare. - Prepare. - The periscope is submerged, a little higher. - Top ten! - Chamber one? - Chamber one?... - Fire! - Fire! Intervention! - Switch to camera two. - Switch to chamber two. Switched! - Chamber two! - Chamber two! Friend! Sonar commanders. Diving sounds captured. Destroyer at 85 degrees, quickly approaching. Go for 120 meters. Insert the periscope. Jump to 120 meters as fast as possible. - Turn on the emergency lighting. - Turn on the emergency lighting. - Do we have a baby on board? - I don't know anything about it. Commanders! The starboard generator went down. Electrician, for me! Dr. Timmler. You immediately go to your cubicle and write to me for lunch tomorrow detailed front-end report on the topic: '' The difference between a man and an orphan ''. And take an example from life, understand? - You understood me? - Yea. - Captain? - Are you still alive? I already thought you were gone. What happened? The distribution board to starboard was on fire. - Damn it, do it right. - I will, captain. Bow water, captain! - Fighter, take a look at what's going on. - I will, captain. You take over the periscope for now. - What does wiretapping say? - What does wiretapping say? - Rear location, captain! - Rear location, captain. An outer cover is leaking a little bit, we can plug it. Ensign Teichmann, for me! Ensign Teichmann! Ensign Teichmann! - Captain, I was trying to... - Who are you? - What? - Who are you, I asked. Do you have clogged ears? Ensign Teichmann announces arrival! - It looks better, doesn't it? - Yes, captain. If you make the wrong report again, I will kick you off the ship! What do you really imagine under the penetration of water? The message should be: '' The outer seal in the stern area is water permeable. '' Clear? Yes, captain. When you pee, you don't immediately talk about the waterfall. And now they fall. - Captain, to starboard... - Shut up when I speak! - Yea. And now fall to the ground. And the others will explain how to deal with this water penetration. I will, captain. And you sure want to let me know that the generator is good again, right? - Yes, captain. - What does wiretapping say? - What does wiretapping say? - Rear location. - Rear location. - Periscope level! - Periscope level. Above! - First! - Captain? Radio operators... - Encode the message. '' Commando Union... '' - Commando Union... 2 tankers and 2 cargo ships with a total displacement of 35,000 tons were sunk. Signature. - Good morning. - You are expected. - Thanks. - Hello, Teichmann. - Hello lady. Glad you came. Thanks. - In a yellow vase. Please, come. - Thanks. - Please sit down. - Thanks. We haven't seen each other in a long time. As you did? Good? I am very happy... Very happy that you wrote to me... Please put it here for now, okay? ... and she invited me. The husband will come immediately. And that you visited me in the infirmary. - What would you like to drink? A cup of tea or...? - Thanks. I'm mixing something for you, okay? Please, sit down again. But I love you, Edit. I know that. I just came for you. - You wrote me. - Please. Let's go. Teichmanne. I didn't forget anything, and yet, I have no idea what I should say to you. The servant has not yet learned to tie his tie properly. - It's better now, isn't it? - Yes, I have a valet. This servant is a great thing, you don't have to do anything alone. - Anyway, what are you drinking? - Nothing until now. Little people, aren't you abstinent? No sir. - I'll prepare something to drink. - No, stay seated, I can take it. - But... - No but. Sit in a chair. Teichmann must also try my special cocktail someday. - I hope he's not that crafty again. - You will drink what you earn. Do you like Lüttke's? Not particularly, to be honest. - Do you know him? - So I don't know him, he's my friend. I asked him to ask you. Much effort. He hates me. But what, are you just kidding. You can talk to Joachen Lüttek. It's a little inaccessible, but it melts on the spot with a glass of whiskey. It's embarrassing. - See, your special cocktail was very strong. - Please. The torpedoes were taken. The submarine is ready for action against the enemy. Dude, you tears. - She can't take it, it's too much for her. - And what do you want to do with it? She told me to come back. And I will go. Maybe he needs me. Additional! - Am I interrupting, Ensign? - But no, Lieutenant. I feel kind of responsible for how you spend your free time. I wanted to invite you to explore the beauties of the city with me. - Are you interested in French architecture? - Do not stop! Especially live! - Don't be more stupid than you, Emil. - Me, why? Among us will be a woman, a mulatto or a Creole or something... Zebra's name is because she likes to wear a black and white striped dress. - If he's probably using one, right? - You're a great psychologist. - Life saver? - It never hurts. - Prevents delayed ignition. You don't seem to have read more than Plato. Health... - Gentlemen, leave exactly at seven! - Come on, Lieutenant! - Thank you dear. - Dude, it's Lüttke! He probably wants to sound the night alarm here, in my view. We will probably put Mr. Lüttke in a coconut. - Here we go. - How will it end? Captain. Lady. Friends. Lady. Ensign, drinking here. Let me, lady, sit next to you. - Thanks. Can I introduce you to my captain? - What does he say? He just introduced you to the lady. I introduced myself. That you are not ashamed, first. I didn't want to touch you. If you need an interpreter... - I don't need any. - Gentlemen, this is a drink. - Thank you, Emil. And now excuse me, please. My mouth can do more than just speak French. - I believe you. - What is this conversation again? He says his mouth can do more than just speak French, Captain. You act like impossible, first. - Why? I just wanted to tell her that I also knew how to sing. - Very funny. Will you allow me to greet the famous submarine commander Lüttke? - It's allowed. - Captain! - My captain is an ascetic man. - What does he say? That you are an ascetic person. See you? - He wants to know what you're denying. - All bad. So, why is he here? Captain, you want to know why he is here. - Stupid question. - Have fun, captain. Please excuse me, Lieutenant. Lady. Pure whiskey. Me too. I know, captain, that I act again, but let me drink for your health. I pay! What you have against me? I will say exactly that so that we finally know what we are doing. I don't like you as a soldier or a human being. As a soldier, you did something unprecedented and attacked an officer. So, so? How do you know that? The man who asked me to take you with me. - Wegner? - You were lucky that no one reported it. Unfortunately, where there is no claimant, there is no judge. And even Wegner only learned about it much later. Then. And do you know who the officer was? - Lieutenant Pauli behaved like a pig. - It is not for you to judge. If it weren't for the friend's recommendation, I would take him off the ship on the first day. Both for you as a soldier. I'm not interested in your private life, but it seems that their human and military levels are no different. Life is too short to be angry at a German officer. You can speak german I can do more than just German. Come Dance. Aircraft! - What was the visibility? - Four to five miles, Captain. - Cloud height? - 1000-1500 meters, captain. Are you telling me you didn't see the plane? Captain, the machine did not fly horizontally, but did dive. He emerged from the clouds about 500 meters from the ship, dropped the bombs and disappeared again. So it was probably controlled by the Holy Spirit. I can't explain, captain. I need to know why he may have attacked us without being able to defend himself. You must have heard the engines. - Yes, but when he took off, not when he flew. - Did you hear anything? Yes, but it wasn't until he dropped the bomb. He probably shut down the engines before. This is bullshit. How do you know that? At most, it can be said that the Ensign did not hear any of these engines. But I am pleading your unqualified claim, right? Yes, captain. I will report this case. You will bear the consequences yourself. - Sure, captain. - You... I don't care what happens to you. You have no idea what this is about. If what you just said is true, we can scrap our submarines. So the war is over for us and we're all going to peel potatoes. Don't your idiots understand? I will take you to court martial. They have a new locator. And the commander refuses to admit it. - And the location? - Quite complicated. But no, they have a device for the plane to sniff us without seeing them. Look, I'll explain it to you. This storm is us... This is a steel tube, our submarine. My knife is a target beam that the opponent sends to find us. He's looking for us now, isn't he? Be careful. Now he is suddenly upon us and the storm has not noticed him. And then he falls to the ground, so... He focused, and that is us, or rather, it was us. To fight positions... Prepare cameras one through five for a photo below the surface! Ready cameras... - Five ready. - One ready? Go back, quickly go to twenty meters. - We're going twenty meters. - Insert the periscope! - Both down. Both machines with full power forward! A corvette is heading for us. Go to the periscope level... One ready? Prepare... Chamber one! Friend! - Chamber two! - Prepare! Friend! - Chamber three! - Prepare! Friend! Intervention. - Chamber four! - Prepare! Friend! - Second blow. - Yes and two out. Go for 150 meters... - At 150 meters... -... and close the flap. - Close the tail flaps. - Quick, move! - Top ten! I have signals at 88 degrees. Perhaps an enemy submarine. The wrists are very clean. I'm keeping in touch. Aiming at beam. They sniffed us. They want to win an order. They will not receive anything from me. I have contact with an enemy submarine at 92 degrees. Clean and constant impulses. Friend. Turn on the emergency lighting! They lost us. - I did not ask you anything. - Yes, captain. I want to leave. Let me go. Get me out of here. Put the baby to bed. So it is for the rest of the day and all night. Corvette against the submarine. And it looks like the submarine will be submerged forever. - Captain? - Yea? - Which is? - We're almost out of flashlights. We are always underwater for more than 16 hours. What are we going to do? - Let's emerge. - What? Yes, I'd rather go up than go down. - You understand? - Yes, captain. - Prepare to emerge. - Both at full strength! - Prepare to emerge. - Both with maximum power. Drain 500 liters. - Captain? - Which is? - When we are on the surface, what will happen? If the request were made for similar questions, you would receive one now. Second! Periscope level. Yes, captain. - Prepare secret things for destruction. - I will, captain. I repeat, Admiralty. For stormy seas and lack of ammunition watching an enemy submarine is very risky. Action canceled. End. lnženie? - Captain? - They'll be good waves, won't they? I would say it is a storm. I think we can celebrate a birthday. Yes, captain. Butcher, how are we? All damage was removed, except flap four of the torpedo chamber. She's stuck. Come on, or they'll pirouette us again. We do what we can. Move boys, fuck you. - The two are going up. - All right. It's not working, pig scythe. - The old man is going to destroy us today. - I do not. Captain, we must stop our work. People cannot do that in this cold water. Posers. And they will take a hot water bottle with them. - Bring me a respirator. - Breathing apparatus for commanders! - Breathing apparatus for commanders! - And they freak out. - Don't undo me. - Is the flap open? - Could not be opened. I once told you to value your answers more. You should have said that Teichmann was unable to open the axle flap, and not that it can't be opened, okay? You understood me? - Yes, captain. - Go down the stairs and open. - Move on! - Mark me. I sank for the last time. And the commander kisses my ass. He won't do that even if you take a shower. Move, get out and let it dry. I am going down. Let me go. Everything is fine. Above! The supervisory officer reports that everything is perfect. Both machines run at a slow speed. Course 162 degrees. Aircraft! Move on! - He took the first one. - Take him down! '' Amazing airplane attack. The opponent has a new locator. I am withdrawing a motion for a war process against the naval lieutenant, Prince of Wartenstein. Lüttke. '' - Radio operator! - Heads up! - Captain? - Sign first. It's late, captain. The first is dead. Imagine being a lieutenant. The man with the loudest clapper and now the lieutenant is stunned. They invited us to go to Bremen to celebrate the promotion. Remember old Professor Heyne and his cellar... - You are not listening to me at all. - But yes. Hansi, I like mushrooms, but... Don't go to the Wegners. - Why not? - It will be a hassle. Please come, make yourself at home here. - Sit down, preferably here. - Thanks. We no longer have a servant. We fired him. We do everything ourselves. - How's Lüttek? Do you smoke - Thank you. - Are you still up in arms? - I think we're a little closer. Well well... Thanks. Over time, all problems will be resolved, although they seemed unsolvable. Teichmann, I don't want to do theater here for you. I don't see and I will never see again. There were times when I cursed the English for doing only half the job for me. Those times are over. Thanks to two people for still being alive. For you and... You must have smiled badly now, right? - Yes. - Yes, I understand. I wanted to say that I owe you and my lady the fact that I am still alive. This is exactly what I wanted to say to you. The last time you were here, everything was very new, unusual. We haven’t taken care of everything yet. Yes Yes. Do you know what I realized? This life is a wonderful thing, because life is not so insignificant, how one thinks when one is healthy. But you probably know that. He's already here. Time. - Edit! - Yea? I have a surprise for you. Teichmann has arrived. - Hello, Teichmann. How are you? - All right. You are old. Like all of us. - Bring us a drink to welcome. - Yes, I'd love to. You know, we share our lives. Everyone has a task. What one cannot do, the other will do. Don't worry, the glasses won't break this time. In the meantime, I learned how to prepare your special cocktail. - Thanks. - Thanks. And now let's drink to Lüttke. May it always arise. - I am useless. - Don't bother me with your bullshit. You could hear me too. It's very important to me. - Who fired them all? - I. - So I don't think the house is so empty. - How empty? I do not understand. - Come on, sit here. - Thanks. What would you do if the people you were ready to die with orders to... -... killed dad? - What? Yes, I think about it all the time. Who killed whom? In this writing, the administration of the Belsen concentration camp tells me that my father died suddenly of an internal disease, and if I want his remains, I have to pay shipping costs, so many Reichsmarks, and indicate the account number this and that. Only after the money has been transferred can the corpse be delivered. Hello Hitler! - Gerd, your father did nothing. Is not true. - But yes. He spoke contemptuously of waging war. - Besides, he had a criminal record. - Your father? His grandparents were Jews. And I'm a Jew in the fourth, or eighth, I don't know much about it. I've been thinking about it. If I don't marry a Jew, my sixteen children will be Jews and they will be able to live. In my opinion, nothing happens to 16-member Jews. But these are forums for me, Vögele would say. - Don't be cynical, Gerde. - I'm not a cynic. Nobody is cynical by nature, but... Sometimes, it is the only way to overcome certain things. The next day, Lieutenant Heyne, the only son of a man executed in a concentration camp, board a submarine to fight for the preservation of Western culture. If I refuse, they will cut my head out of cowardice. At the same time, I was promoted to lieutenant out of bravery against the enemy. What should I do now? Gerde... Can I help you? Sit down again. There is no reason to protest against us. We are both just small fish and sooner or later we will be eaten by sharks. Gentlemen who hear a giant shark that lives only on the dead. So, now the little fish will go to bed well. Good night, Hans, sleep well. Where your room is, you know. But tomorrow... We have another day tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow everything will look different. Goodnight. Good night, Gerd. Gerde! Gerde... - Proceed. - Hans, you can't show up here in that uniform. - I do not mind. - Hold the tab. Get out here! There will be nothing with me, Dórinka, not today. Idiot, I don't want anything from you. I want to get you out of here before the plane catches you. Fair and they will come! Let them in, bro! I am smart. Dora, be human, won't you? There are people who say that I am human. Just let them... Dóro, Gerd Heyne, my friend Gerd Heyne killed himself. They are right, these guys. They realized. I hear. - To calm down! Shut up! - What is he talking about? - Calm down, okay? - You are all my friends... - Then invite us for a drink. He's very glossy, dear. It is a pity that you are so stupid. That you are terribly stupid. - Slowly. - Keep this shit, okay? - You still believe in Jesus! But he died! But a shark, you don't know anything about him. Great shark and small fish. And those little fish, it's you, and he's going to eat you. This will eat us all. All of us! All of us... Hansi, take it with you. We need to take a train to France. - Yes. - Dora, if you only knew what gave me the trouble of finding him. I looked everywhere every night before thinking about looking here. - What are you talking about, where should I be somewhere else? - Yea. Thank you, Dora. - Shall we have another one? - You've had enough of last night. But goodbye, for me, for me. I was wondering what you said about the great shark. I can't believe he would eat us all. There are many small fish for us. There are always some. - And let's have a drink! - Health! And now go. Goodbye, Dóro. - Hi Hi. My God, bring them back, goldfish. Alarm! - Alarm! - Teichmann understood. Everyone inside! Severe blow! Water penetration! Close the partitions. Closed! The ship is at the bottom. Depth of forty meters. Get ready to climb. Distribute the cans. Everyone and eat what they can. We don't know how long we will have to swim. - The front section is clean. - Open the front screen. - That is all? - Yes, captain. All. Stolenberg. Where is Stolenberg? - Stolenberg! - Shut up! That's where the other thirty are. In the back, she drowned. Let me in! Put it in my cubicle. Radio operator and links him. Take a self-contained breathing apparatus. - Engineer, instruct the people again. - I will, captain. - Loosen the screw in the manhole. - I will, captain. Hurry, share the cans! Get ready to go up. This is an order! There is no more order for me, I will stay here. That would suit you. Now it's the only thing to get out and survive. I didn't want that horrible war, I conducted it fairly, so I'm going to end it too. I am the commander of this submarine, and it does not matter if it is on the seabed or on the surface. And as a commander, I order you to speak. Otherwise, I pat my friendship, understand? Feel free to hit me. You smothered me from the start. I also wanted to put you in my mouth, when Stolenberg took me out of the boiler room. And now he's behind the counter. I lost all my friends and a woman, that I loved. But you are fine with that. - Something's wrong with me. - It's out of fashion. Eat, quick! Then we will all be wet as mice, but eventually we will see paradise. Do you think it will be blue? The sky is always blue somewhere. The point is that the person is directly below him. Mohre, get your senses back. You want to leave too, don't you? - Yes, Lieutenant. - So you see. Be careful and listen to me carefully. You've heard it a thousand times, but I'll tell you again. If you get out of here to the bottom at once, it's over. So keep your nerves calm and strong. Which is? So, sit here, boy. - I'm going to open the torpedo chamber and the manhole. - Yes, captain. One more thing. The bridge is probably shot, they can project sharp edges and break the respirator. You know, then it would all be over. When passing through the manhole, be careful, okay? - Yes, Lieutenant. - Then break your neck. - Water! Everyone listen to me. As the water rises there, the pressure is equalized. So we left. Place the nozzles and nose clips. The 40 meter water column compresses the submarine. Lüttke must fill it with water, so that the compressed air inside the ship opens the hatch. Only then can men leave. Drain the climbing rope. First team, now! The next day, at dawn, a German submarine discovers the wreckage and takes eight survivors out of the water. Among them is Teichmann. Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesternKasa / GM FEV2021
