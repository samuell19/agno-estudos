(unintelligible conversation) Look, Bibi, your cake! - Bibi! Look at that! Everything is made of Marzipan! - That's so nice of you! That was not necessary, it wasn't very special. No. You only saved the life of two kids. Who wants first? - Me, please. But not that much. Its only two weeks. - No Problem, Dad. Frau Hubner and Bernhard will help you. - Dad! I am 12! I know. But... - Tournament is Tournament. I need to do this. Mom? As long as Tom is on Tournament can Florian stay in the guest house? Good Idea! - Yes? Thanks! Tom! Florian can live in the guest house as long as your in London! Okay,I don't mind,yes! - Yes! Please can I have everyones attention! Especially Bibi! Lets go, Lets go! Our well known and beloved Mayor asked me, Karla Kolumna, To hand Bibi the honorary needle of our Town. He couldn't make it here. "For her heroic and courageous rescue at the fire. Which made it possible to save the Muller-Twins! The Mayor." (Karla) And this is for you, Bibi. Bibi! A bit more respect! - As a Witch you need to use magic when someone is in Danger. - That was so brave! You have a Letter! It looks funny! Can you open it, Bibi? Yes... l'm getting the Witches Crystal Globe, Mom! Tomorrow! "The Young witch Bibi Blocksberg, will be awarded on Sunday, the 15 at 8' o'clock,for special Merits the Crystal Globe of Galinda. Walpurgia, Chairman." Bibi! I'm so happy! - You only get that when your 15! Bibi will get it so much earlier! Oh, I'm so happy for her! Oh what Crystal Ball is this? - The Witch's Crystal Globe! Without that your not a real Witch! - You always say that you are one, right? Right. But more like an apprentice! - Bibi, The Witch Apprentice. Haha. Very funny! lh! Uah! Wow! Like in a Fairy tale! Is it precious? Immeasurable! and irreplaceable, says Mom. What can you do with it?? - Everything! Look back into the past, and the future... like a kind of Crystal Globe television. No camera behind it? - No! - When Bill Gates finds out about that one...! He will pay you millions for the Patent. Can you turn it on? For that I need Mom's Crystal Globe witches demanding. But she won't tell me. Hey, Flo! Listen! When your Father falls in Love with Karla Kolumna he won't go on tournaments. Then your not alone anymore. But I'm cool with being alone. Someday I'll go too. Don't tell mom about the Crystal Globe! This is totally her Sanctuary. Dad? Can you look after Florian, when I fly to Blocksberg? Its not even decided yet,young lady that you will fly there. - Of course I will fly! Mom! A full Witch in the house is more than enough! What does that even mean, more than enough? I can go then. Barbara, please! - Bibi is a good witch and really advanced for her age, she is ready for her Crystal Globe! Or have you ever saved the lives of two children? She only made it rain! - Why don't you try that! The Lawn needs water! - I'm just a normal human! and not a ...Sorcerer. - But I am a witch! And my daughter is one too. You knew that from the start. And I should have never gotten involved! Sorry! It just slipped out I didn't mean it. I just have too much work. I just know that Buttkock wants the balances, and they are not ready by tomorrow. He is going to say..Blocksberg, Speed is not witchcraft! Your Witches at home can help you with that! He doesn't trust me. When he hears about the Crystal Globe, he trusts me even less! We will treat this Crystal Globe ceremony very discreet. Nobody will ask I promise you. Oh Gosh! I need to show the Witches a magic Trick! Which one? What do good Witches spells? The bad Witches always have more ideas. (Music) There are no bad witches. Bad Witches there Are none.. (Voices) Bad Witches... Bad Witches do spells. There are no bad witches, they are all just make believe. If someone says different, they'll soon will disappear. I'll zap him into the darkest grave even if its difficult. I'll dance on the graveyard at night, to calm my very soul. (Music) Bad Witches do spells... There are no evil cats. That's right! Never mind! The chinese talking cat! Will be my Magic spell! Eene meene Cat, Start talking like mad! Hex-hex! (The Cat speaks Chinese) Chinese? No one understands that! We better try again! even if its difficult, and if it takes all night! I'll dance till dawn, to calm my very soul! To calm my very soul... for my soul... To calm my very soul. Your not going,looking like that, Bibi? Going to Blocksberg? A Witches Crystal Ball Ceremony, its not a Dance competition! Eene meene Rittersporn, for Bibi a ceremonial uniform! Hex-hex! How does this look, when I fly on my broom! (honking) Florian! This is embarrassing! Good Morning, Bibi! I'm so relieved,that when you leave, Flo stays here. This is for you so you can come and go. But I'll be always here. Only today I have to go to the Blocksberg. Oh! Touch this. - You feel warm. -I have a fever. Stage-fright probably.I know that from the theatre. When two hundred people stare at me.I always feel hot and faint. You only play the Trumpet, and not have to do a magic spell! ''only'' that's funny. Ok, Flo.Lets get this over with. Look after yourself.- You too. I'll write you on how the tour goes and where I am. Come! Morning everyone. - Morning, Bernhard.- Flo! Welcome in your new Holiday accommodation . - Thanks!

Come. - Just a moment,Bernard that is my Taxi! Bernhard, that is my Taxi! - Of course. Sorry. What is going on with you? - See you, Tom! - See you , Dad! Today is Saturday? - Yes. Why is he going to the office then? Dad is totally confused. He even forgot his Briefcase! That is Tom's Briefcase! It's his Trumpet! Crap. Mom! Tom forgot his Trumpet. - What? What are we going to do? - He is going to notice very quickly. And he will tell us where to send it. Or he will borrow one - Hello! Hello! - Am I late? I wanted to write about Tom in the weekend edition. Maybe he will be a famous Trumpet player someday! He has gone to the airport.He forgot his Trumpet. - I can take it with me there! I just need that eye cream for my wrinkles. - I'm sorry but the witches kitchen is closed today. You can hang on until tomorrow. - You think? Lets go mom! We will be late! - See you later.And Good Luck! Eene meene Dandylion, fly away, my Baldrian! Hex-hex! Wow! Now my turn! Eene meene mei fly away, Kartoffelbrei! Hex-!hex! Karla! No photos about flying ! Bernhard will get in trouble with his boss! Nobody will mind a few photos. - Probably not. Hello! Hello! (Music) Bibi! Not so wild! Bibi! Can you see? Up there is the Blocksberg! (Music) (unintelligible conversation) Welcome to the Blocksberg. Come, give them your broom. Did you have a good flight? - yes. So this is your Bibi, Barbara! Beautiful girl just like the mother! Adorable! Hello, Bibi! Schubia and Arkadia will look after you, my dear! They will be the most horrible Traditional witches! Your streaks are amazing! - Made them myself! But... Aunt Walpurgia doesn't like it, She only likes black-haired boarding school witches. Why are you not in our boarding school Bibi? - I rather live with my parents. Which means, I'm moving out. - In your own apartment? ln our guest house. Can you tell me where I... - Are you exited? - Oh yes! Have you seen Rabia, she totally looks old! - And broke. Buy yourself eyeglasses, Edwina. You don't look like 105 anymore either!To let you know! (Spannende Musik) Maybe she really didn't steal the recipe for eternal youth. If Aunt Walpurgia hears us talk about that, were in trouble! - Why? Come with me! There is a safe with recipes and Magic potions and stuff. A year ago the safe was broken into and the formula for eternal youth disappeared! Stolen! For ever? - yes! And there was a smell in the air like Hyacinths! And everyone knows that only one uses Hyacinth tinktures! - Rabia! They searched her whole castle! Far and wide no formula! Only 300 pairs of red shoes. She collects them. She's got a screw loose! - Oh Gosh, were going to be late! Eene meene Kinderhasser down with the flushing water! Hex-hex! Barbara! - Rabia! Is this the small heroine? Cute. You can't even tell, that she is not... - What? That she is only half a witch. Still together with the pretty Bernhard? Its not the right time for your attacks Rabia. - Attacks? Why?I worry about the future of our witches coven. About the superiority of our witches, and a child growing up in a human environment, having the responsibility for a witches crystal Globe is perverse. Leave that to Walpurgia! She is Council President. Not you. (Music) Welcome, Sisters! Three Cheers Hex-hex! (All) Hex-hex! Hex-hex! Hex-hex! Sisters,We are gathered here today to honour a girl! that,despite its youth, proved to be a courageous grown up, responsible Witch! Bibi Blocksberg kept,during a flaming Inferno Despite danger to Life, Limb, and Broom 2 helpless children from certain death. Come closer, my Child. You know,actually a witch gets her witches crystal Globe on her 15 Birthday and with that gets accepted into our society. You are ah? Twelve. Twelve-and-three-quarters. - Almost 13. This Globe contains The healing power of Galinda. Whoever gets this has a great responsibility! The powers of the globe will help you with rescues and healing. And the dept of the visions guides the dept of your thoughts. Her wisdom becomes yours and guides your actions! But before we get too emotional. What spell have you brought us? - The chinese talking cat! All right. Lets see! Eene meene Superpaw, come forth China cat! Hex-hex! (Surprised exclamations) Eene meene sailors linen, Cat, run now on two legs! Hex-hex! Eene meene garden rake the cat talks german now. Hex-hex! Miau! (Amazed shouting) Sorry. Eene meene Mouse rattle, you stupid cat should start to talk! Hex-hex! (Surprised exclamations) What a pity! Bibi! We all know you can do spells. That was a classic attack of? - Stage-fright! I agree. who is in favour, that Bibi, despite her mistake be allowed to get her Crystal Globe? Witches of the inner circle... step forward! You know the rules? - yes. Your only allowed to to good with the Globe. Whoever abuses this will be punished with two years in the Bog. - Very good. And now happening, as it is customary. Long as your nine lives the globe should give you luck! Long as your seven lives the globe should give you luck! Long as your seven lives the globe should give you luck! Long as your seven lives the globe should give you luck! Long as your seven... My Globe! How Embarrassing! Can no one here fix the globe? Eene meene heart arrow, Globe, be whole again! Rabia! Was that intention? - Why? No! I don't have a reason! - There is only one solution. Rabia. Give your Globe to Bibi Blocksberg! If that is supposed to be a joke Walpurgia, its a bad one ! My Globe? Why on earth should I. Your Globe. That one! - Noo! We can call in the Night Court of Justice! Since we not a democracy but a Witchocracy, The Judgement will be 5 years in the Bog If you keep resisting me! Can I put good word in - That speaks well for you defending her, but My decision is final. Rabia gets a new Globe, As soon as the next Witch enters the eternal Witching grounds. This will be your Globe, Bibi. Long as your seven lives the globe should give you luck. Give you Luck. Hex-hex! - Hex-hex! Hex-hex! Hex-hex! (Unintelligible) (Knocking) Should I test you for your Homework? I have not memorized it yet! Can you explain the Globe to me. Maybe you can get rid of these weird letters Beber, bebe, ribitzebe... Weird. Walpurgias Spell should have freed it from all the outstanding commitments. Is that a Commercial? - Not in a Witches Globe! I was wondering, as soon as I try a spell, the letter soup disappears. Look at that! - You landed in the wrong time. When was that, I can't remember that at all! Bibi ,your in the future! - I haven't done anything! If you think only one second about the future, all the Globe's timescale is off. Your Thoughts should be clear like Crystal! I only thought for 2 seconds about my geography homework! What is that look in dads eyes! - What happened? (captivating music) Life is a downer when your getting old, Mistress. How could you let them take your Globe? Why don't you use a spell to get it back! Because there are no spells to steal it back, stupid Purrpuss! Now your missing the last ingredients for your youth potion! Want to get wrinkled? Do something! My fur is getting gray already! 10 ingredients where still needed! 10 of 365! I cant believe it! It your fault! Why didn't you make a copy of the formula? And you? A witches globe as a safe hiding place? Ha! Thats how it is! That's how it is! Why don't you just get it back from this Silly girl whats-her-name! How then,do you think they'll invite me to lunch, so I can steal the Globe for desert, yes? - I heard that they are a small and happy family... And now they have 2 globes! We are not happy, and we have no globe! I'll find a way! You can rely on me! _ Squirrels often fight with each other,to... What do you think of squirrels, Maribor? For Breakfast? Hm... You want to turn into one? Does the globes operating range reach London? The Globe doesn't measure distance! Why? Tom plays today in the ''Rockhouse''. Eene meene Zirkuspferd, there is Tom in the Concert! Hex-hex! By the way the Concert. They are closed! Maybe they had to reschedule. Because he has no Trumpet No they have a holiday! - Tom wouldn't lie to me. Right. Maybe he plays tomorrow. - Lets see, what he is doing right now. Eene meene Witches Globe, show me Tom in the city crowds, hex-hex! That's why! He has a girlfriend in London! But Tom has no girlfriend. He would have told me!! Weird... The Lady reminds me of someone. Me too! Of my dentist. What is she doing in london if I have an appointment after tomorrow! Haha! But what if your globe is right? - The globe is always right! Then Tom really did lie. Just like back then when mom left. He said she would be back. Just like Janna in my class. Her mother left on a sunday. Mine left on a friday. On Sunday me and Dad went to the Pool. And later to the Cinema. I'm heading over. Maybe he already called. And explained everything. We can look in the globe again tomorrow. Sleep well. You too. (Music) ''Hello, Flo. I'm in London. Its raining. The Concert in the''Rockhouse'' was a great success. About 200 People, and no one left. Now everyone left for their Hotel rooms. I'm alone and a bit lonely... Weird. The Mayor is building a fitness room in the town hall! But no new Gym. - Somehow he needs to loose some weight! Need some more Coffee? - Tee! You are so nervous!

You help me the most when you don't do spells, as long as this annoying merger is in process! No Witches Globes, no flying, no nothing, hm? Bibi? Whats that in your hair? The same color as Schubia. - I find it looks super. Look! cute! - What are they named? Chip and Dale. - Striped Squirrel from India. From so far? So early in the morning?

The color doesn't change back! I know I was not allowed to take it. I only wanted to know about Tom and the woman beside him. I have my suspicions. My Globe almost broke! I'm really mad at you! Should I leave? - I don't care! Move to Timbuktu! l'm not wasting my time anymore with your Family drama. (Melancolic Music) You where really successful today! They caught you as stealing squirrel and you didn't get the Globe either, as a cleaning lady. Shut up! We need to try something different! With Wits and cunning! Bernhard doesn't like that his women do spells. How can we get them to stop doing that? That's it! Renouncing! They will renounce witchcraft! - Re. . . what? Renounce! Give up being witches! Renouncing the Witches demanding. Your a genie! And so simple. - Simple? They have always been Witches. The Blocksbergs are not going to renounce Witchcraft! Especially Bibi! Since 1458 it only happened 4 times. But it doesn't matter. She has to do it. She has to loose everything she loves. Her friend! Florian, he's gone. The Parents,the money. Money! We need the youth Potion! My fur is turning gray! Quiet! As If I didn't know! So! Step one _. Friend gone. Step two _. Parents gone. No! Or, We will see. Anyhow It will be the Globe's fault! - And? And? When Bibi Blocksberg renounces witchcraft, the globe goes back to Walpurgia. And of course back to me! One misfortune after the next! Bad luck is a Home run! Like Dominos! (thrilling Music) My Glo- (Music) What was that? (Music) Ah! Bibi, your sweating! Are you sick? - Rabia wants her globe back. You where dreaming, Bibi. - She won't stop for anything. I feel it in my Witches nose. - Quiet up there! Ah! Au! CrapGlobe! Hach! Florian left. - I know. He left a message. Everyone is mad at me. Dad, Florian, my teacher has colourful hair because of me. I still love you! - Mothers always love their children. Whatever they do wrong. - would be nice, if it was like that! Why do I make mistakes all the time, even though I know it already? Why do I say things, that I don't think? Florian can't stay alone in his huge house! Someone needs to console him. - Hex him his favourite pizza. Otherwise he will just eat Canned ravioli and Popcorn. Eene meene Magenbitter, Florian gets a Margarita Pizza! Hex-hex! Frau Hubner? - In a half hour he gets Pizza. (Honking) Here is Bibi.

(Melancholic Music) Somehow in the last while, we did not have so much luck with Witchcraft Maybe we can try for a while without it? Completely or not at all, Bibi. Say_.

Don't throw it away! - I have to decide. a Witch without her powers that doesn't exist! What can a Witch do with her life , When she can't do spells anymore? Then the Broom stays in the corner and can't fly anymore, When she can't... If she was a normal girl, from next door When I can't do spells anymore.
