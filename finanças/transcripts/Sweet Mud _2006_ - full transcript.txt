l'm going out for a patrol. Hush, hush... There, there. Little fellow. What is it? Hungry, were you? Good morning, Peaches! Everybody up! Ronen, would you like that in writing? Uzi, get up! How many times have you been told not to sleep with your clothes on? Dvir, get up. Where's Dvir? Good morning, Batya. Good morning, precious. The Egyptian President threatens... -Good morning. Avram is bringing you chocolate. Come here, my darling. Good morning, pretty girl. Eat some. Good morning. Come here, pretty girl. Come here. Come here, Batya honey. Come here, sweetie. Good girl, Batya. Come to Avram. Yes, Batya. Yes, Batya. Avram loves you. Avram loves you, baby girl... Summer 1 97 4 Good morning, Peach troopers. Your Bar Mitzvah year begins today. This year is the most important of your lives. During this year you will turn from children to adults. From a burden on society to a crucial and essential factor. This year, you will receive 1 3 Bar Mitzvah assignments. The assignments will prepare you for life as adults on the kibbutz. You will be informed in advance about some of the assignments and some will come as a surprise. Uzi, wake him up. l expect you to work hard and get through them together while cooperating with each other. Prove to the kibbutz and to the movement that you are worthy of continuing our tradition. To be a source of pride for your parents. To become the kibbutz's future generation. Come in, darling. Peaches, this is Maya Perlman, a foreign pupil from France. Today she'll be joining our class. Please take off your watch. lt's from my dad. Ronen! You'll all receive watches at the end of the year. You can keep the watch but don't wear it because no one else has one. Peaches, who would like their parents to adopt Maya? Ronen, you. -Why not me? -Because you don't have a father. Ronen! Get out! l wish you'd die already! -Die yourself! Son of a bitch! Fight! Fight! What are you doing?! You're all going to be punished! Open wide. Your mouth's much cleaner now. Spit. Wipe yourself. You can go to your parents. Dvir, come here. Dvir, over here! Next time, think before you put filth in your mouth. Spit! Rinse and wipe. You can go to your parents. Uzi, get over here. What do you want from him? He can't speak. -Butt out. Open wide. Spit. Rinse. Wipe. You may leave. Dvir, wait, sweetie. Your mother got a letter from the Swiss guy. l just finished translating it for you. Hey Smiley, good boy. Dvir! Come here a sec. My dog had puppies again. Sorry. -Dvir, keep your dog on a leash! l'll chop off his leg, get it? Mom, we have new volunteers. Mom, we have new volunteers, you have to get up! Mom, go dress up. Shut up and make coffee! Dvir, listen to me. Put this moron with the French faggot, and give her a single room next to the Youth Club. Got it? Then go to Granny's. lf she's angry, tell her l'm working in the field. Working in the field, eh? l'm 90'/. sure he's at the pool with some blonde and 1 00'/. sure she is not Jewish. -Hannah, lay off of him. lf your father knew how you boys are neglecting his tree he'd be turning over in his grave. -Hannah, that's enough now! Who's going to give out the jam? Let him do it. -l don't have the time. Get over here. You give one jar to each member on the list, and tell them it's from Jonathan Avni's tree, who is remembered as a wonderful man to this day. ls that clear? Next time l'll slash that ball! lt's the ambulance driver's kid. l'm striking her off the list. Go. Thank her for me. Close your eyes. l have a surprise for you. Was l on the list? Give me a hug. Why didn't you sleep in the children's house? l just went out for a walk. -What walk? Just a walk. -Did you do your homework? -Not yet. That's no good. You don't do your homework, you don't sleep, and you lie! Look, l have another surprise for you. ls it translated? -lt's inside. What is it? ''l was thinking of visiting the kibbutz this year.'' l'll finally get to see him. He's never been here. Maybe he'll want to stay. Why are you afraid? You're strong. l'm not afraid. l'm strong. You're strong, Mom. Comrades, our agenda is as follows: 1 . The fiscal report. 2. Popsicle and chocolate theft from the kitchen, and 3. Members continue to swim in the pool when there's no lifeguard. But before that, Miri Avni requests to have her boyfriend stay over for a month. l tend to agree, because l believe it is true love, and even though he's a Gentile, he's still the Swiss Judo champion. But of course, we still need to vote. Miri! We met on the beach in Netanya, when l was at the sanatorium. You'd like him. For sure. l request your permission to have Stephan over. l don't see a problem, l think she should be allowed. Our regulations permit members to have partners visit. l'm in favor of allowing it after all Miri's been through. But one month is a long time for a non-working guest. -lt is. Then maybe he could stay for two weeks. l'd like to say that... -We have nothing to say. l'd like to raise another issue: When are we going to decide on buying a new ambulance? The old one has a massive oil leak and besides that, its gear is shot. l don't want to think what'd happen if we ever have to rush anyone to the hospital. -Comrades! Does anyone have anything to say concerning Miri, or shall we vote? ''Stephan, my love. Your letter made me very happy...'' ''Stephan, my love. Your letter made me very happy...'' ''l love you and can hardly wait to see you here at the kibbutz.'' ''Can hardly wait'' is too much. -What should l write then? You can stay for 3 weeks. -3 weeks without working? Make it 2. 2 weeks isn't long enough for anything. ''Don't forget to buy gifts for my kids.'' -That's important. What sort of gifts? -Firecrackers, cherry-bombs... Absolutely not! lt's dangerous. White chocolate or a puzzle. ''Yours, with much love, Miri.'' ''Yours, with much love, Miri.'' Don't wait up. -Don't come home too late. Come on already. Listen, you stay here on watch, l'll get the popsicles. lf anyone comes, call me and we'll run for it. Got it? Can l come with you? -Dvir! lf you want to grow up, you must be brave! lf even stealing popsicles scares you, you'll always be a pussy. Got it? Yes. -Good. So you stay here and watch. Just like a mountain gale Just like a silent song Like trees, in gusts they flail Like a flame forever strong Like a stranger passing by Without saying a word l just sing my song l keep dreaming my dream l keep seeing before my eyes ls it true that he's the Swiss Judo champion? Sure, he's got a black belt. ls he nice? l've never met him, but Mom says he has a kind heart. She didn't say that about anyone, not since Dad died. How did Dad die? lt was an accident. That's what Mom keeps telling me. What sort of accident, though? The Judo champion of Switzerland l'm sure you'll like him. But be polite and don't ask for the firecrackers until he offers. Hasn't he arrived? Stephan! My love. Look at that old fart. Can l get an autograph? The European Karate champion is here! The European Karate champion is here! What an old guy! lsn't your mother coming to the dining hall? l guess she's too busy with loverboy. Shabbat Shalom. This is Stephan. Hannah and Zvi. Parents of my late husband. Nice to meet you. This is my darling Dvir. Look at the dress he bought me! For you. Charming kid. This is Eyal, my eldest. Thanks. They don't need his gifts. For you, Madame. Shabbat Shalom! l have two announcements. First: the kite competition will be held next week, as scheduled. My dog Pitzi is in heat again. Please keep your dogs on a leash! l'm going for my military service on Sunday and it's important to me that Pitzi doesn't get pregnant again. Thank you. Thanks, Stephan. Mom, l hate puzzles. Never mind. Smile and say ''merci''. Merci. Just like a mountain gale Just like a silent song Like trees, in gusts they flail Like a flame forever strong Like a stranger passing by Without saying a word l just sing my song l keep dreaming my dream l keep seeing before my eyes All that ever was l just sing my song l keep dreaming my dream l keep seeing before my eyes All that ever was Like a sea that is not calm Like a straying dog Like a voice that calls Like a land that wasn't sown Like a desert bush Like a barren land l just sing my song l keep dreaming my dream l keep seeing before my eyes All that ever was l just sing my song l keep dreaming my dream l keep seeing before my eyes All that ever was. Dvir and Uzi! You have to navigate back to the kibbutz before sunset. Good luck with your assignment. Don't go off the trails, because if something happens we won't find you. Good morning, Captain. -l'm reminding you: keep your dog on a leash! You sang very well. ln you go. Avram will be back soon. What is it? Want one? Dvir and Uzi are smoking. There's a discipline problem with that class. Shimshon, this is what l wanted to speak to you about. l've been house mother for the Peach class for a while now and l wanted to ask if l could be made a teacher. Being a teacher means having much more responsibility. l'm very responsible, and you know it. Strip. l'll rip you apart. l forgot to bring a condom. Very responsible of you! Quiet, Smiley. Smiley. What is it? What do you want? Do you want to go for a walk? Go. Don't come inside. -Yes, yes. What? -Shit! Hooligans! l'll kick your asses! Today l'm happy. Thank you. From now on you will always be happy. lt is paradise here. l understand why you never wanted to leave all these years. l'm willing to move here. Very simply. l will close my restaurant, rent out the house and give my pension to the kibbutz. We don't need anything. Miri, this is an ideal place to live together. l love you, Miri. Darling! You're right on time for the chicken. Smiley did Avram's dog. -Don't worry, nothing will happen. -Mom. Come here. l want to tell you a secret. We're getting married. Really? -Yes. Would you kindly offer me a light, Dvir? Thank you, it's for you. Wait. l'll help you. l'm also a kite champion. Hello. Hello, Sir. Where are you from? From Paris. And you? From Switzerland. Good luck with the competition. Thank you. The little one likes you, do something. How come you speak French? -My parents do. Where are they? -My Dad's in France. He is alone and had problems, so he sent me here. But soon he'll send for me. My Mom used to be alone too. But now she's getting married. Lucky you! Good afternoon, members of kibbutz Bet-Gvurot. The judges have reached decisions and l have the results right here. 3rd place... lnbal Goren! Great work, lnbal! ln 2nd place, Ronen Herzberg! Great job, my sweet! And in 1st place... Dvir Avni! You've won for showing creativity and ingenuity. Hip-hip-hooray! Dvir, come here. Get over here, l want to talk to you. Dvir, come here right now! How many times have l told you to keep your dog on a leash! l've told you a thousand times... My hand! Violence? Not in our community. Not now, not ever! lt's against all our values, our education... We will not tolerate such bestial behavior! He raised his hand on one of us, he must go! l'm not angry at them. l understand. Stephan, don't go. Miri, think again. We can't go on meeting only once a year. Bring the kids and come to Switzerland. l can't. Why? l don't understand. l don't understand. Little man. Take good care of your mother. Stephan, don't go. Please. Mom, tell him not to go. Maya, want to come steal popsicles with me? Come on. Listen, you stay here on watch, l'll get the popsicles. lf anyone comes, call me and we'll run for it. Got it? Can l come with you? -Maya! lf you want to grow up, you must be brave! lf even stealing popsicles scares you, you'll always be a pussy. Can girls be pussies? Whatever, it's just an example. Now stay here and keep watch. -Alright. Smiley! Please wake up! Please! Please... Get up now, please! What kind of a mother are you? -What's wrong? He killed Smiley! Because of you. Because of you! You're not a Mom, you're a wreck! Dvir... Go back to the children's house. Now! lmpossible. Avram's a good guy, a great worker, and l don't see any reason to blame him, considering your dog could open doors. Maybe he was hungry, opened the door and got locked inside! This place is rotten! -Don't raise your voice! You've got two kids, and we take care of everything. Have you heard any complaints? No. -And why is that? Because in our community, we all give as much as we can and get as much as we need. When you were hospitalized... -That was ages ago and l've recovered! Your visitor didn't work for 2 weeks, and that's great about our community. Why was he kicked out?! -Because he broke a member's arm! That's enough! You can't blame the kibbutz for your problems! Why don't you ask yourself what you can do for the kibbutz! Miri, don't do it! Why? Why?! Why? Good morning... l'm alright. l'm alright. l'm alright! -Miri? lt's alright. Miri... -l'm alright! -Miri, everything's alright. Come with me now. You're late for work. Can you hear me? What does she want from me? ls it my fault the Swiss guy dumped her? You devil! l'll kill you. Miri, calm down! Give me the pitchfork! l'll chop you up! You maniac! -Miri, put it down or l'll send you back to the hospital! Go ahead, hospitalize me! Maniac! -l'll kill you!! Maniac! The shoulder! Stop it! Let me go! Happy Birthday to you... Mazal Tov! Mazal Tov. Aren't you happy? l already have a bike that Mom gave me. Now you'll have a new one. -When are they going to let Mom come back? Dvir, we had this conversation just the other week. Your mother needs time. l want to see her. She can't see you right now. -Why not? Dvir, don't worry. She's in good hands. l've got to visit her. She must miss me. Eyal is going to visit her tomorrow. Would you like to write her? l don't want to write her! l want to see her! Autumn Hi, sweetie. How's Mum? As good as new. - Really? Looks great, she's all better. That's why l brought her back home. She's in the kibbutz? Asleep. You can see her later. Will you come with me? Can't. My draft orders came, l'm outta here in an hour. You're not coming to see Mom? Dvir, don't be a baby! l'm enlisting! When are you coming back? -ln 3 years. But l'll be home on weekends. Will you come with me to Mom's? Just for a few minutes? Don't worry, Dviri. Go see her every day, make sure she goes to bed early, and see she's off alcohol and medication. Dviri... How are you? What's that? lt's the puzzle Stephan bought you. l wrote him a letter. Want me to read it to you? Yes. ''Stephan, my love. l was happy to get your letter. l want you to know l remained faithful to you in the hospital. And l can hardly wait...'' How is it so far? Want to start over? ''Stephan, my dear love'' Comma. ''l apologize for everything that's happened. And l want you to know that l love you and miss you a lot. Don't give up on me, please.'' Period. Stephan's left me. Don't worry, Mom. We'll find someone better for you. ''From Tel Aviv. 50 years old. An army officer. lntelligent, and has a car every other weekend''. And this is his military post address. He wouldn't want me. Fine, then l'll write him. ''Young, kind-hearted, sensitive, intelligent, a perfect dancer, terrific Mom.'' Don't write that l smoke. Fine. Up on your feet! Up! Get in, coward! ''l swear to the Movement!'' -l swear... Get in line. On the tractor! Step forward! l swear to the Movement. -l swear. On the tractor! Step forward! l swear! -l swear. On the tractor! Step forward! l swear! -l swear! On the tractor! Step forward! Winter Dvir! l brought you some kerosene. We agreed to bring her back, although the kibbutz decided she wasn't sane. But you have to be careful. Do you understand? You have to be careful that what happened to your father won't happen to you. What happened to my father? lt's her fault. All her fault. Wanna do something special? Like what? Wanna go for a walk? But it's raining. -Then we could cook something. Let's go out to the field, get some potatoes and bake them. Mom, it's raining. We'll take an umbrella. You won't melt. Would you like that? Yeah. This is fun! -Say again, dear? This is fun! This is fun! This is fun! You're fun. You are the best part of my life. Let's go back. l don't want you to catch a cold. Dviri... you're a big boy now. l want you to know that this time l recovered for good. Your mother is as strong as an ox. Mom, what's that suitcase? l'm going to Stephan. Didn't l tell you? No. When are you leaving? ln one hour. Mom... You're not going anywhere. ''You are the world, and the world is you. l need you like the air l breathe. Day and night, and when l fall asleep. Dad, l want to hug you.'' Sounds better in French. Sounds good in Hebrew, too. Really? This is from France. My Dad told me to save it for hard times, when l can't take it anymore. l have two left. Want one? Are you sure? Thank you. Good night. Don't stay up too late, Dvir. Have you been drinking? l'm sorry, l was alone. And the puzzle is tricky. All pieces are white. You should go to sleep. -l can't sleep. Why did he leave me? -He didn't leave you. He loves you. Why doesn't he write to me? He will write... l'm sure he will. Now go to sleep, okay? Today we will learn about sex. First, there's no sex without love. And why? Because two people who have a baby must love each other. Otherwise, their child will not be happy. ls that clear? So first there's love, then sex. But only after the age of 1 8, is that clear? This is the second time you're late. Next time you'll be punished! -Take your seat. This is the male organ, the penis, and this is the female organ, the vagina. The brain commands the penis to become erect and grow and it gets bigger and bigger. The vagina senses it, and begins to lubricate, in anticipation of the penis. The penis realizes this and inserts itself in the vagina, where all at once it ejaculates millions of sperm cells. This is how we get pregnant. So to sum it up: Love plus sex, after the age of 1 8, equals pregnancy. ls that clear? Excuse me. Have you seen Dvir? -No. He didn't sleep in the children's house, so he missed the personal assignment. They're very angry with him. -Shall l go look for him? -No. There's lots of work today. Start sorting. Miri, you got a letter. l just finished translating it. Shall l read it to you? ''Miri, my love. Ever since l left lsrael, l haven't stopped thinking of you. You are the woman of my life. You are my other half, l could never let you go. l believe we'll work it all out soon and be able to be together forever. Meanwhile, you must be strong and think only good thoughts. Remember, love conquers all. Stephan.'' lf a baby cries, you will hear it over the intercom. Then you take a bottle of milk and rush over to the baby. ls that clear? Yes. -Dvir... Let's go patrol the fence. l'll let you fire the rifle. l wanna stay. Scared, huh? Fine. Just don't you dare fall asleep. Kids, this is Avram. Don't burn the milk, or you'll fail the assignment. ''l think of you when l get up in the morning. l write a poem for you before l go to bed.'' ''l think of you when l get up in the morning. l write a poem for you before l go to bed.'' Draw a flower here. A heart. A heart's better. Okay. ''P.S. Give my regards to Dvir. Do as he says, 'cause he's a smart boy.'' Carob. Mom... What is it? l'm depressed. Why? l'm alone. No, you're not. Everyone is leaving me. Nobody is leaving you. Look. You got another postcard from Stephan. l'm out of Elaterol. What's Elaterol? A pill that warms my heart. When did you start taking it? After your father killed himself. What do you need, sweetie? l need Elaterol. Why? -For my mother. l gave her two packs the other week. -She's out. l can't give her any more. -She needs more. lt warms her heart! l know what it does, but overdosing can be harmful! She's suffering, don't you get it? -Calm down. You have lots of it! Why are you being so mean? You don't understand... -Oh, yes l do. This is Hannah, my grandmother, she runs the laundry service. This is Zvi, my grandfather, who's our teacher. This is Miri, my mother. She works in the laundry, too. This is Stephan, her boyfriend. Owns a restaurant in Switzerland. That's Eyal, my brother. This is Jonathan, my Dad. He died, so that's why he's in a different color. And this is me. -Well done. How did your father die? -Ronen! -Sorry. My father killed himself. l don't know what to do. l'm scared. Let's write her another letter from Stephan. lt's no use. She doesn't write him back. So we'll write him in her name. ''Stephan, my love...'' What does she want to say to him? That she is willing to leave the kibbutz. That she wants him to send plane tickets right away. That l love him. Spring Thanks, sweetie. Thanks. ln the field, we ate nothing but plants, then we had to navigate in the night. l was out of bullets, so l pulled out my knife! Then they put me on the stretcher. The tank went up in flames, the chopper didn't show up, so eventually l got promoted! Why are you so quiet? -Will you come with me to see Mom? Dviri, l'm dying to get laid, l've got two hours. Mom's in bad shape. -l know she is. What can l do? Want some? - Someone's got to help her. -No-one can help her. She doesn't want to live, she said so. Don't worry. Everybody wants to live. Dad didn't. -Dvir, give me a break, l'm dying to get laid! Dvir! l'm sorry. Sit down for a second. Don't take this upon yourself. You can't. No-one can. Mom's ill, she'll never recover. -She would if Stephan wrote her. She can't go on thinking about him. lt's driving her crazy. She got a letter. But l didn't have it translated. When? ''l'm sending three tickets, in case Eyal wants to come along. My love, l can hardly wait to see you in Switzerland. Love, Stephan.'' l'll miss you. A lot. Do you want to come with us? There's a ticket for you. l do. We're leaving straight after the fire ceremony. But it's a secret. l won't tell. What are you thinking? l think l love you. lt's a secret, you see. We're going straight after the fire ceremony. lt will be alright. You must hold on for two more days. Promise me you're going to make it. Promise? Promise. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. We're together. We're leaving together. We're together. We're leaving together. Our Bar Mitzvah graduates, Peach class! And first to go is... Oren Slutzki! -Lift! Pull! Jump! Well done! -''Oren, my dear, may you be a source of pride to the Movement and the kibbutz. May you grow up to be an officer, like me, and may you always remember where you came from. We love you very much, your father and mother.'' Well done, Oren. Well done! And second is... Uzi Kaplan! -Lift! Pull! Jump! Well done! Go on! ''My sweet Uzi, on this exciting day l would like to ask you, if l may, to always work hard and make everybody proud of you. Always remember, we all love you! Your Dad and your Mom and all the kibbutz members.'' Well done! Next we have... Dvir Avni! Lift! Pull! Jump! ''My dear Dvir, on your special day l wanted to wish you that you'll be a kind person, that you'll be a person...'' My Dvir... l tried writing, but it didn't work out. So l'll give you my blessing from the heart. My child, l wanted to be a mother to you... l wanted to raise you and to care for you. But l couldn't do it. l'm sorry. lt's not my fault. -Miri. -Wait! My darling Dvir, l wish you a happy life! Full of love. And l hope you run away from this place and never come back! Let go of me! Because this kibbutz is death! Full of evil people! You must know the truth! You must know the truth! Your father wanted to leave, too! But they suffocated him! They crushed him! Until he broke! lt's a kibbutz of evil people! They wouldn't let me take you and your brother! They said l'm crazy. They wouldn't let me take my kids! You must know the truth. Run away! As far as you can! Save yourself from this hellhole! From these evil people! Run away! Forgive me. lt's for life, Mom. They're going to hospitalize me. Tomorrow. l just want to sleep. Help me. We could still go away. We'll run away first thing tomorrow morning. You won't be hospitalized. Dvir, l want to sleep. Please have mercy on me. We'll go to Stephan's. We'll get up and go to Stephan's. l want to sleep. Don't you understand? Can't you understand? l have to go to sleep. l'm out of pills. Help me, Dviri. What pills do you need? Valium. Take care of yourself. After l am gone, Spare the gravestone, Save it for a building. Don't print a book of my life, Save the space on the shelf. Don't waste a day in my memory. Enough, we have had enough. Tzipora Shaul,
