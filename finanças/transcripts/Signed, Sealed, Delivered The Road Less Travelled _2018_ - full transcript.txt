HAZEL SAYS THAT, UH, TERMINAL ANNEX JUST DROPPED OFF A NEW SHIPMENT OF-- [NORMAN]: FIRE IN THE HOLE! [MUFFLED EXPLOSION] [SIGHS] [NORMAN]: WE'RE FINE! EVERYTHING'S OKAY. AGAIN. GOOD TO KNOW! AGAIN. [BOTH CHUCKLING QUIETLY] YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO GO-- [TOGETHER]: ...SEE HAZEL. YEAH. [♪♪] EWW! THIS ONE HAS A HOLE IT IN! A MILLION POSTCARDS IN HAWAII, AND PEOPLE MAIL THOSE. OH! HOLD ON. [HAZEL]: OH, THAT REMINDS ME, WHERE ARE YOU AND NORMAN GOING ON YOUR HONEYMOON? [RITA]: OH, WELL, MY PARENTS GAVE US THEIR STARCRUISER, SO WE'LL PROBABLY TAKE THAT SOMEWHERE FUN, BUT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH MORE TO DO FIRST. [HAZEL]: WHAT'S A STARCRUISER? [RITA]: IT'S SORTA LIKE A WINNEBAGO. [HAZEL]: HOW FAR HAVE YOU GOTTEN ON THE LIST? "THE LIST"? WHAT LIST? THERE'S A HUNDRED THINGS TO DO? OF COURSE NOT. THERE ARE THOUSANDS. THOSE ARE JUST THE FIRST HUNDRED. THANK YOU, HAZEL. [CHUCKLES] AS USUAL, YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT HELPFUL. HAVE A GREAT DAY! RITA? [RITA WHIMPERS] IT'S OKAY. THIS WAY. THIS WAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! THERE'S EVEN A LIST OF WEDDING LISTS. AND ACCORDING TO THIS, I'M ALREADY FIVE WEEKS BEHIND. YOU JUST GOT ENGAGED FOUR WEEKS AGO. GOOD MORNING, LADIES. [RITA]: MORNING. WHAT HAPPENED NOW? UH, WELL, WE EXPERIENCED A MINOR CHEMICAL MISFORTUNE. A LITTLE TOO MUCH POTASSIUM CHLORATE IN NORMAN'S "RAPID RECOVERY" MIXTURE. WHAT'S THAT? A NEW AND IMPROVED "REVELATION SOLUTION FOR THE PARTICULARLY ILLEGIBLE AND INDECIPHERABLE." I SEE WE'VE BEGUN OUR WEDDING PLANS ALREADY, HMM? [CHANGING TOPICS]: OLIVER! UH-- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OLD CAMERA? [OLIVER CHUCKLES]: WELL. IS THAT... [SNIFFING] COCONUT? IGNORE THAT. UH, WELL, THE HOUSING IS CARDBOARD AND NOT PLASTIC, SUGGESTING AN EARLIER MODEL. UH... THE COCONUT DAMAGE HAS ERASED THE EXPIRATION DATE, BUT THERE IS A PARTIAL ADDRESS. UH, J-A... "M"-SOMETHING... "K"-- NEXT WORD IS ILLEGIBLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE? NOTHING. LAST WORD ENDING IN "...I-T-Y." UH..."CITY"? OH, THERE ARE SEVEN TOWNS IN COLORADO WITH THE WORD "CITY" IN IT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE REMAINING INFORMATION HAS BEEN WASHED OFF BY THE, UH, COCONUT MILK. HMM. WHAT IS AN OLD CAMERA DOING IN LAST WEEK'S "UNATTACHED ITEMS" BOX? [INTERCOM BEEPS] NORMAN? IT'S TIME TO COME IN NOW. [NORMAN]: ROGER THAT! PERHAPS I CAN LIFT A REMNANT OF INK WITH OUR NEW SOLUTION. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SUCH A CHEMISTRY BUFF. OH, YES! IN FACT, WHEN I WAS 10, I BEGGED MY FATHER FOR A CHEMISTRY SET BUT HE FELT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON INDOOR PURSUITS ALREADY, SO HE SIGNED ME UP FOR LITTLE LEAGUE INSTEAD. [LAUGHS] HOW LONG DID THAT LAST? THREE DAYS. TOO MUCH DIRT? [SHANE LAUGHS] HERE I AM! WHAT DO YA GOT FOR ME? WHOA... I HAVEN'T SEEN A CAMERA LIKE THIS SINCE MY COUSIN BARTHOLOMEW'S BAR MITZVAH, WHEN I WAS 12. YOU KNOW, RITA, PROVIDING THESE CAMERAS TO YOUR WEDDING GUESTS MIGHT BE A WONDERFUL WAY FOR YOU TO CAPTURE MOMENTS YOU MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE GET TO SEE. I GUESS, BUT EVERYBODY HAS CELL PHONES NOWADAYS. WELL... NOT EVERYBODY. AHEM. MS. MCINERNEY, IN OUR WORLD OF INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND COUNTLESS RE-DOS, THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY SATISFYING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO HIT "DELETE" IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER PHOTO WITH BETTER LIGHTING OR A MORE PERFECT SMILE. AND SOMETIMES... IT'S THE IMPERFECTIONS IN LIFE THAT MAKE SOMETHING... PERFECT. HMM. WELL... YOU STILL HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE. NOW, SHALL I WIPE IT OFF, OR SHALL I JUST LEAVE YOU "PERFECT"? TRUST ME. LOOKS LIKE A SOLUBLE FELT TIP BLUE MARKER. HANDWRITING IS SHAKY... INDICATING POSSIBLE HAND TREMORS. THE PENMANSHIP SUGGESTS WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEONE EITHER REALLY OLD OR REALLY YOUNG. WELL, MAYBE THEY WERE REALLY YOUNG WHEN THEY TOOK IT, BUT NOW THEY'RE REALLY OLD? WHOEVER IT WAS USED THE WHOLE ROLL. CAN FILM THAT OLD STILL BE DEVELOPED? THE PICTURE QUALITY WON'T BE VERY GOOD, BUT THERE'S A CHANCE WE'LL GET SOMETHING. THEN YOU MUST AT LEAST TRY, NORMAN. MS. MCINERNEY, YOU AND RITA TRY AND TRACK DOWN THE MAKE AND MODEL OF THE CAMERA. LET'S FIND OUT HOW OLD THESE PHOTOGRAPHS REALLY ARE. SO, THE ROLL WAS SERIOUSLY COCONUT-IZED, AND THE FIRST 15 OR SO ARE FRIED, BUT I'VE GOT THIS ONE. OH, YES! THE 35-MILLIMETER "FUNSHOOT". FROM THE SLING? REALLY? YES! THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. SO THE DISPOSABLE "SLING" WAS CHANGED TO THE "FUNSHOOT" IN 1989. MM! WELL, ACCORDING TO THIS, THEY STOPPED USING CARDBOARD HOUSING ON DISPOSABLE CAMERAS AROUND 2003, WHICH MAKES THIS AT LEAST... WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? UH, BIG HAIR... AND BIG HAIR. I'LL SAY! [LAUGHS] [OLIVER]: PLEASE, TAKE A LOOK. MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING OTHER THAN HAIR. AND TAKE YOUR TIME. NORMAN IS GOING TO BE A WHILE. OKAY. [HUSHED]: UH, IN THAT CASE, IS IT OKAY IF I TAKE RITA FOR COFFEE? SHE'S PRETTY STRESSED OUT ABOUT THE WEDDING PLANS. DIDN'T THEY JUST CHOOSE A DATE? YES, AND NOW SHE'S WAY BEHIND. [♪♪] ANYTHING NEW TO GO ON, NORMAN? OH. UH, WELL... I TRIED DEVELOPING THESE A FEW TIMES, BUT THAT'S THE BEST I COULD DO. THE FIRST ONE LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TAKEN FROM A MOVING CAR, AND THE NEXT ONE DOES, TOO. WELL, THAT'S A... A ROAD SIGN. BUT WHAT IS THIS? UH, IT LOOKS LIKE, UM... MELONS? IN THE SKY? WELL, SOMETIMES, AN IMAGE CAN GET SUPERIMPOSED ON ANOTHER IF THE CAMERA ISN'T WOUND PROPERLY. AHH. HUH! DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? "ORDER THE FLOWERS." I CAN DO THAT. "HIRE THE MINISTER." WHAT ABOUT NORMAN'S GRANDMOTHER? SHE'S VERY SPIRITUAL. "ORDER THE INVITATIONS AND HIRE A CALLIGRAPHER"? HAVE YOU SEEN OLIVER'S PENMANSHIP? "SECURE A VENUE." I DON'T HAVE A VENUE! I HAVE YOUR VENUE! WHAT? RAMON'S NEW RESTAURANT. THINK ABOUT IT! UH, THE CAKE, THE CATERING, THE BAND-- HE CAN TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THAT. -IT'S PERFECT! -HUH. NOW ALL YOU NEED IS THE PERFECT MAN, WHICH OF COURSE, YOU ALREADY HAVE. [LAUGHS] WELL, IT SEEMS AS IF OUR PHOTOGRAPHER WENT FROM TAKING PORTRAITS TO LANDSCAPES TO... FOOD. YEAH, BUT NOTHING TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC LOCATION OR PERSON, EXCEPT FOR THIS WOMAN. THE LOWER ANGLE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER IMAGES. TAKEN BY SOMEONE SHORTER? A CHILD, PERHAPS? EXCEPT THAT THE FIRST ONES, OF ALL THE HAIR, WERE TAKEN BY A TALL PERSON. THEN WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO PHOTOGRAPHERS. AN ADULT, AND THEN, LATER, MAYBE... OLIVER. MM? LOOK. [♪♪] [LAUGHS] I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THAT HAIR. AND THOSE CLOTHES! OH! OLIVER! WE THINK WE KNOW WHERE THESE WERE TAKEN. THERE'S A BANNER THAT READS-- SOMETHING "...THE '80S." WE'RE THINKING "END OF THE '80S" OR "FAREWELL TO THE '80S." AND PROBABLY AT A HOTEL, BECAUSE THERE'S A PODIUM WAY IN THE BACK AND YOU CAN JUST MAKE OUT THE LETTERS "...U-E-B-L-O." "PUEBLO." SO WE THINK IT'S A NEW YEAR'S PARTY IN PUEBLO, COLORADO IN 1989. "FIND ME, DADDY. "WE'RE IN GRAY CAR. I WANT TO GO... HOME." OH... [♪♪] "I WANT TO GO HOME." THIS IS SO SAD! LOOK AT THAT LITTLE BACKPACK. LOOKS LIKE HE'S PROPPED HIS LITTLE NOTEBOOK UP AGAINST SOMETHING BLUE. POST OFFICE BLUE! LIKE MY WEDDING COLORS. OR LIKE A MAILBOX! COULD BE, AND THAT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF LOG? THIS FEELS SO URGENT, EVEN THOUGH IT HAPPENED 30 YEARS AGO. WELL, THERE IS NO EXPIRATION DATE ON THE TRUTH. SOMEONE MIGHT STILL BE LOOKING FOR THEIR FATHER, OR A FATHER FOR HIS SON. I'M GONNA FILTER FOR PARENTAL ABDUCTIONS USING "J-A-". JACK OR JAMES "M"? OH, RITA, WHAT WERE THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS ENDING IN "CITY"? CANON, CENTRAL, COMMERCE, GARDEN, LAKE, ORCHARD, AND SUGAR CITY. [OLIVER]: NORMAN, RITA, WILL YOU CHECK FOR PLACES IN PUEBLO THAT HAVE BANQUET ROOMS? AND IF SO, HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE RECORDS DATING BACK TO THE '80S, HMM? I'M GONNA CALL DALE AT THE STATE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS. PERHAPS THE OLD CHILD ABDUCTION RESOURCES ARE BETTER AT THE STATE LEVEL. YES? UH, THANK YOU. YEAH. [HANGS PHONE UP] WITHOUT SUFFICIENT DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION OF THE CHILD OR CAPTOR, AND CONFIRMATION OF WHEN AN ABDUCTION TOOK PLACE, THEIR HANDS ARE TIED. AMBER ALERTS DIDN'T BEGIN UNTIL 1996, SO I'M TRYING TO ACCESS EARLIER RECORDS FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN. [NORMAN]: OH, SO JUST SMALL CONFERENCE ROOMS, AND NO BALLROOM. WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. [RITA]: OH, HI, SYLVIA. WE'RE TRYING TO LOCATE THE ORGANIZERS OF A PARTY THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED AT YOUR HOTEL BACK IN THE '80S. WE'RE WONDERING HOW FAR BACK YOUR RECORDS GO? NO, IT WAS A PARTY IN THE '80S, NOT AN... [REALIZING]: ...'80S PARTY. WAIT! WHEN DID YOU SAY THAT WAS? AND WAS EVERYBODY DRESSED UP, LIKE, LIKE, MADONNA AND "FLASHDANCE"? OH, YES. ALL THE BIG HAIR. YES! AND WAS THERE '80S STUFF EVERYWHERE? LIKE, UH, RUBIK'S CUBES AND, WELL, DISPOSABLE CAMERAS? OH, YES. LEG WARMERS... WAS THERE A SIGN THAT READ... "MEMORIES OF THE '80S"? "MEMORIES OF THE '80S"? GREAT! THANK YOU, SYLVIA! YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU GUYS... I THINK OUR CHILD WENT MISSING THREE WEEKS AGO. THREE WEEKS AGO? YEAH, SO, THE BANQUET ROOM AT THE HOTEL MESA PUEBLO WAS BOOKED A MONTH AGO BY THE PUEBLO NORTH HIGH SCHOOL CLASS REUNION, 1988. THAT EXPLAINS THE VINTAGE CAMERA. SO OUR CHILD IS STILL A CHILD. AND THIS CAMERA IS NOW OUR TOP PRIORITY. I'M GONNA CHANGE THE SEARCH PARAMETERS FOR A RECENT ABDUCTION. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THESE WOMEN. RITA, TAKE A PHOTO OF THE PHOTO, EMAIL IT TO SYLVIA. MAYBE SHE'LL RECOGNIZE ONE OF THEM. OKAY. [SHUTTER CLICKS] ALL I SEE IS HAIR AND MORE BIG HAIR. [OLIVER]: THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN ONE PHOTOGRAPH, AND IT'S CERTAINLY ABOUT MORE THAN JUST... HAIR. WE... ARE GOING TO PUEBLO. AND... WE'LL NEED SOME SORT OF A... UH... MOBILE COMMAND UNIT, HMM? UH, NORMAN, RITA! MAY WE ENGAGE YOUR RECREATIONAL VEHICLE? HMM? WELL, UH... WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY-- [RITA]: WHAT A GREAT IDEA! IT'LL BE LIKE A PRACTICE HONEYMOON, ONLY BETTER, BECAUSE WE'LL ALL BE TOGETHER. [SHANE]: OH, RITA... I DO LOVE YOU. AWW! NORMAN? YOU ARE MARRYING A WONDERFUL WOMAN. THANK YOU. [DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS] HAVE I MENTIONED THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THAT THING? [OLIVER]: IT'S QUITE STRIKING. EXTRAORDINARY, REALLY. AND BIG. JUST THINK OF ALL THE PLACES THIS VENERABLE VEHICLE HAS TRAVELED. DO I HAVE TO? MY PARENTS PUT 200,000 MILES ON IT! WELL, THEN, LET'S MAKE SURE THE NEXT 200 MILES COUNT, SHALL WE? MM-HMM! WELL... DESPITE THE GRAVITY OF OUR MISSION, IT WILL BE FUN TO GET HER OUT ON THE OPEN ROAD AND SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO. OOH, WELL, HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST? MY TREAT. AH. [♪♪] ♪ ALL I'VE GOT IS DUST IN MY POCKET ♪ ♪ ALL I TELL YOU WON'T CHANGE YOUR MIND ♪ ♪ ALL I'VE GOT IS DUST IN MY POCKET ♪ ♪ I'VE GOTTA MOVE ON... ♪ YOU SEE, NORMAN, IT'S REALLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT. YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH EVERY LITTLE NOISE AND RATTLE IN THE CHASSIS, IF YOU WANT TO LEARN WHAT SHE LIKES AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T. OKAY. [OLIVER]: THE THING TO REMEMBER IS ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION... HOW'S IT COMING? OH! WELL, FOR THE CAKE, WE BOTH LIKE CHOCOLATE, SO THAT SHOULD BE EASY, AND RAMON CAN PICK THE MUSIC. WHAT ABOUT THE INVITATIONS? WELL, IT SAYS HERE, "ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR A BIT OF WHIMSY IN YOUR WEDDING." SO I'M THINKING INVITATIONS IN THE SHAPE OF OWLS THAT SAY "GUESS WHO'S GETTING MARRIED"? VERY WHIMSICAL, VERY YOU. AND THEN, FOR OUR COLORS, WE'LL JUST STAY POSTAL. RED, WHITE, BLUE? RIGHT! OKAY. JUST HAVE TO KEEP A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN LOOKING BEHIND AND LOOKING FORWARD. GOT IT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU HAVE TO TREAT HER WITH RESPECT-- DON'T PUSH HER TOO HARD, OR SHE MIGHT, UH, SHE MIGHT BREAK DOWN. WELL, WE DON'T WANT THAT. NO. BEFORE TOO LONG, WITH PATIENCE AND DETERMINATION, YOU START... YOU START TO BECOME ONE. [SHANE]: EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE STARCRUISER, RIGHT? I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW, THAT ONCE WE GET TO PUEBLO, THE HOTEL EXIT IS 43. THEN YOU TURN RIGHT, GO 4.2 MILES, AND, WELL, THAT SHOULD BE COMING UP IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES. OH, THANK YOU, MS. MCINERNEY. MM. MY PLEASURE, MR. O'TOOLE. [CHUCKLES] [WHISPERS]: I KNOW YOU LIKE TO KEEP THINGS PROFESSIONAL, BUT WE'RE OUT OF THE OFFICE NOW, SO IT'S OKAY TO CALL ME SHANE. UH, WE ARE OUT OF THE OFFICE, BUT WE ARE IN THE MOBILE UNIT. A, UH... FINE DISTINCTION, PERHAPS, BUT... I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT. OH. YOU DID? UH-HUH. I JUST LIKE HEARING YOU SAY IT, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU, MR. O'TOOLE. [NORMAN]: OH, LOOK! EXIT 41. SO CLOSE. [CELL CHIMES] OH. [♪♪] OH. [♪♪] [AWKWARD CHUCKLE] OH, YOUR PHONE DINGED. OH. THANK YOU. WHO'S ALEX BRIGHTON? OH, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO READ IT. I JUST LOOKED DOWN AND-- IT'S OKAY. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. IT SEEMS LIKE HE REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. I'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF WRONG NUMBERS RECENTLY. OH. [♪♪] [OLIVER]: WELL, EVERYONE, WELCOME TO MESA PUEBLO. [♪♪] GOOD AFTERNOON. HI. CHECKING IN? DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION? UH, NO. AND NO. [SNEEZES] BLESS YOU. THANKS. WE'RE ALL SOLD OUT TONIGHT, UNFORTUNATELY. WILDFLOWER CONVENTION, HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. OH, I UNDERSTAND. WE JUST HAVE A QUESTION. [SNEEZES] BLESS YOU. WE'RE HERE FROM THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. WE'RE HERE TO SEE SYLVIA PELLSON. SHE'S IN CATERING, AND SHE'S EXPECTING US. [DIALS PHONE] HEY, SYLVIA? HI. I HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HERE SAYING THEY'RE FROM THE POST OFFICE? SAYS YOU'RE EXPECTING THEM? SURE. OKAY. SHE'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. THANK YOU. [SNEEZES] BLESS YOU. FLOWER ALLERGY? [SNIFFLES] HANG IN THERE. RITA? WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THESE FLOWERS FOR YOUR WEDDING? OOH, THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL! OH! AND PRICKLY! MM. ARE YOU THE FOLKS FROM THE POST OFFICE? YES, WE ARE. HI. I'M SYLVIA. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? UH, WE WERE HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE WOMEN IN THESE PHOTOS. [LAUGHS] OH, HO! WOW. JOANNE AND BECCA ARE GONNA LOVE THESE! THEY SURE WENT ALL OUT. YOU KNOW THEM? SURE DO. THEY'RE OUR ACCOUNTANTS DOWN ON FOURTH STREET. THEY DO OUR AUDITS. DO EITHER OF THEM HAVE A CHILD? HOW OLD? UH, WE'RE ESTIMATING ANYWHERE BETWEEN 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD. WELL, THEY HAVE KIDS, BUT THEY'RE ALL IN HIGH SCHOOL. WELL, IF JOANNE AND BECCA TOOK PICTURES WITH THE SAME CAMERA AS OUR CHILD, THEN THEY MUST'VE CROSSED PATHS SOMEHOW, RIGHT? HOW MIGHT WE FIND THEM? [♪♪] THERE WEREN'T ANY CHILDREN THERE. NOT THAT I SAW, ANYWAY. I DIDN'T SEE ANY. WOW, MY HAIR WAS BIG. WERE THERE A LOT OF DISPOSABLE CAMERAS OR JUST THE ONE? JUST ONE. IT WAS PART OF A DISPLAY OF A BUNCH OF '80S STUFF. I MEAN, WE JUST STARTED PLAYING WITH IT. THOSE THINGS ARE FUN TO CLICK. I MISS CLICKING. I SEE. I MEAN, NOWADAYS, YOU'VE GOT TO PRESS, AND SLIDE AND PRESS, AND IF YOU WANT VIDEO... WAIT A MINUTE. MY HUSBAND WAS RECORDING THAT NIGHT! JEREMY! I HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS YET, SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S ON IT. HOPEFULLY NOTHING TOO EMBARRASSING. YEAH. IT WAS QUITE A NIGHT. [♪♪] [JEREMY, ON VIDEO]: YO! CLASS OF '88! [ALL CHEERING AND HOOTING] [LAUGHTER] '88! '88! EIGHTY-EIGHTY-EIGHTY-EIGHT! I'LL JUST FAST-FORWARD A BIT. [CLASSMATE]: JEREMY CARR! LOOK AT YOU, MY MAN. [JEREMY]: OH, MAN, I SEE YOU'RE ROCKIN' THE ZEBRA PRINT! [CLASSMATE]: CLASSICS NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE, AM I RIGHT? AND... CAN YOU BACK THAT UP, PLEASE? SURE, BUT IT'S JUST ME AND ERIC BEING STUPID. [JEREMY]: ALL RIGHT! LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED! YO, ERIC! HEY, MAN! JEREMY CARR! STOP! OLIVER... THE BACKPACK. THAT LOOKS LIKE THE ONE WITH THE LETTER IN THE LAST PHOTO. WELL, THAT'S HIM! THAT'S GOTTA BE HIM! WHY CAN'T WE GO TO THE POLICE? WE HAVE A VIDEO. OF A WOMAN AND A LITTLE BOY, BUT NO FACES, NO NAMES. NOTHING TO REPRESENT ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. [RITA]: BUT WE CAN CONNECT THE DINOSAUR BACKPACK IN THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE ONE IN THE VIDEO. [SHANE]: WELL, AND IF THEY STAYED HERE, THEY PROBABLY HAVE A RECORD OF HER CREDIT CARD. [RITA]: BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS PAYING CASH WHEN SHE WAS TALKING TO DOUG. [SNEEZES] OH! DOUG! I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE THESE. THEY'RE THE EXTRA-SOFT ONES WITH LOTION. THANKS. I THINK SYLVIA JUST WENT ON HER BREAK. ACTUALLY, WE'RE HERE TO SEE YOU. WE NEED YOUR HELP. UH, DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS WOMAN? SHE MAY HAVE CHECKED IN HERE ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO? [RITA]: IT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE '80S REUNION PARTY. WHO COULD FORGET? I'M SORRY, GUYS. I CAN'T GIVE OUT GUESTS' PERSONAL INFORMATION. OH, WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE? THE MAIL PEOPLE. WE'RE SPECIAL AGENTS FROM THE D.L.O. TASK FORCE ON A TOP-PRIORITY MISSION. IT'S LIKE THE F.B.I., ONLY POSTAL. I BELIEVE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT, UH, LIKE YOU, WE ARE UNABLE TO DIVULGE CERTAIN DETAILS. HOWEVER, UH... I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO MAY BE MISSING, AND WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO FIND HIM. LET ME SEE THAT. OKAY. YEAH! THE-- THE KID WITH THE DINOSAUR! AND THE LADY. SHE WAS A BIT FREAKED OUT, THOUGH. HER CREDIT CARD DIDN'T WORK AND THEN THE KID RAN OFF. I'M SORRY, BUT THIS CARD DECLINED. THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE. DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER CARD YOU WANT ME TO TRY? [QUIETLY]: NO. NO. THAT'S OKAY. HOW MUCH DID YOU SAY THE ROOM WAY? WITH TAX, IT'LL BE $115.85. [♪♪] LET ME GET YOUR CHANGE. [♪♪] DID YOU SEE A LITTLE BOY? ARE YOU SURE IT WAS HER CHILD? I JUST ASSUMED. OH! AND THE FIRST NAME ON THE CREDIT CARD WAS RACHEL. I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S NAME. DID SHE FILL OUT A REGISTRATION CARD, BY ANY CHANCE? OH, IT WAS SUCH A CRAZY NIGHT, WITH ALL THESE WEIRD '80S PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND. I FORGOT TO ASK HER TO FILL ONE OUT. I BLEW IT, DIDN'T I? [SNEEZES] -BLESS YOU! -THANK YOU. ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HER? ANYTHING AT ALL? WELL... WHEN SHE CHECKED OUT THE NEXT MORNING, SHE SEEMED A BIT CONFUSED. I ASKED HER IF SHE NEEDED DIRECTIONS SOMEWHERE, BUT SHE SAID-- -I'M OKAY. -YOU SURE? OKAY. BYE. [♪♪] BUT THE WEIRD THING IS, A COUPLE MINUTES LATER, SHE WAS STILL STANDING OUTSIDE. HER KID WAS PULLING ON HER, AND IT WAS AS IF SHE WAS STUCK IN SOME OTHER WORLD. SHE WAS LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD AS IF... SHE COULDN'T MAKE UP HER MIND WHICH WAY TO GO. AND NEXT TIME I LOOKED UP, SHE WAS GONE. I'M SORRY, THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU GUYS. WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE, THIS IS MY CELL NUMBER. I HOPE HE'S OKAY. HE WAS A CUTE KID, WITH THAT BACKPACK AND THAT... WAIT! [♪♪] SOMEONE IN CATERING FOUND THIS IN THE BALLROOM A WHILE AGO. NOW, I BELIEVE IT BELONGS TO THE KID. NORMALLY, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DISPOSE OF THESE AFTER THREE WEEKS IF NO ONE CLAIMS IT, SO I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T TAKE IT. UH, IN OUR LINE OF WORK, THIS IS WHAT WE REFER TO AS AN "UNATTACHED ITEM"... AND WE NEVER GIVE UP. I HOPE YOU DON'T. WELL, WE KNOW THAT HER NAME IS RACHEL, AND THAT THE LITTLE BOY LIKES DINOSAURS, WHICH GETS US FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD-- FIGURATIVELY, OF COURSE. WHAT ABOUT THE "...I-T-Y" WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF THE CAMERA? I MEAN WE THINK IT STANDS FOR "CITY," RIGHT? WELL, THERE ARE ONLY TWO TOWNS NEARBY THAT END WITH "CITY". THERE'S SUGAR CITY, WHICH IS 60 MILES EAST, AND THEN THERE'S CANON CITY, WHICH IS 39 MILES WEST OF THE U.S. 50. WAIT. WHAT PHOTO COMES NEXT, NORMAN? THE ONE THAT'S AFTER THE '80S PARTY? UH, WELL, THERE'S THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TAKEN FROM A MOVING CAR, AND THEN THE ONE AFTER THAT DOES, TOO, EXCEPT THAT ONE'S DOUBLE-EXPOSED WITH SOME CANTALOUPES AND... WAIT! A SIGN THAT READ "U.S. 50 WEST"! [SHANE]: MM-HMM! ON TO CANON CITY!

[SHANE]: OKAY, ONE MORE TIME-- BIG HAIR, THEN MADONNA, THEN BLURRY SPEEDING CAR PICTURE, THEN U.S. 50, AND IF SHE WAS COMING HERE TO CANON CITY, WE SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS ROADSIDE STAND BY NOW. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK, OLIVER? OLIVER? I'M SORRY, HMM? OH. YOU'RE TIRED. YOU DID A LOT OF DRIVING TODAY. WELL, SO HAVE YOU. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE SUCH AN EXCELLENT DRIVER. WELL, STICK WITH ME, KID. I'M FULL OF SURPRISES. YES, YOU ARE. YOU KNOW, A YEAR AGO, I WOULD'VE SAID THAT WE WERE ON A WILD-GOOSE CHASE. I WOULD LOOK AT THESE PICTURES AND THAT STUFFED DINOSAUR AND THE VIDEO, AND I WOULD KNOW THAT NONE OF THIS IS GONNA GET US ANY CLOSER TO FINDING THAT LITTLE BOY. MM. BUT... I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME, OLIVER... THAT THAT CHILD DIDN'T JUST DROP A CAMERA INTO A MAILBOX, HE MAILED A PIECE OF HOPE, AND SOMEHOW IT FOUND ITS WAY TO US, AND HERE WE ARE, IN A STARCRUISER. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING, BUT I KNOW THAT-- THAT WE'RE ON OUR WAY, AND I'M TRUSTING THAT WE'LL GET THERE. UH... DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? YES. "TRUST THE TIMING." RIGHT? [HAWK SCREECHES] WOW-- OH, WOW! WHAT? OH, WELL, DID YOU KNOW THE COLORADO RED-TAILED HAWK CAN FLY AT SPEEDS OF UP TO 120 MILES PER HOUR? NO. NEITHER DID THAT MOUSE. NORMAN, I NEED YOU TO PAY ATTENTION FOR A SECOND. -RUN! RUN! -NORMAN. WHAT? I'M SORRY. WE NEED TO TAKE THIS TEST-- "SEVEN QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE GETTING ENGAGED." BUT WE'RE ALREADY ENGAGED.

NO GPS TO TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW TO GET SOMEWHERE AND HOW LONG IT SHOULD TAKE. THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT BEING OUT ON THE OPEN ROAD WITHOUT A-- OLIVER. WHAT? THE GUY AT THE HOTEL-- HE SAID THAT RACHEL WAS HEADED SOMEWHERE, BUT SHE SEEMED-- ...RELUCTANT, AS IF SHE WERE NOT SURE WHERE SHE SHOULD GO. [SHANE]: WE KNOW SHE HEADED WEST ON U.S. 50, AND SHE WAS GOING TO CANON CITY, BUT... WHAT IF SHE GOT THERE, AND SHE DECIDED TO JUST KEEP GOING? WE'VE BEEN THINKING THAT ALL THE PHOTOS THAT WERE-- THEY WERE ALL TAKEN BEFORE CANON CITY, BUT WHAT IF-- ...ALL THE PLACES IN THE PHOTOS AREN'T BEHIND US, THEY'RE AHEAD OF US. YES! OH, MY GOODNESS.

YOU CAN'T START A MARRIAGE HOLDING BACK A PIECE OF YOUR HEART. YOU'RE BETTER OFF GIVING HER ALL OF IT FROM THE BEGINNING. THEN YOU JUST PRAY SHE WANTS TO KEEP IT. [♪♪] RITA, I DON'T KNOW TWO MORE COMPATIBLE PEOPLE. AS FAR AS YOU KNOW. MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW NORMAN AS WELL AS YOU THOUGHT YOU DID. I MEAN... [SIGHS] MAYBE I DON'T, EITHER. YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW SOMEONE AS WELL AS YOU THINK YOU DO. DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW MANY COUSINS HE ACTUALLY HAS? WELL, I DON'T EVEN THINK HE KNOWS. [BOTH LAUGHING] LADIES? UH, NORMAN BELIEVES WE MAY BE READY TO RESUME OUR JOURNEY. WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE. [♪♪] YOU READY? HEY, I'M A LITTLE TIRED. UM, OLIVER, WOULD YOU MIND TAKING THE WHEEL AGAIN? OH. UH, YES. HAPPY TO. UH, MS. MCINERNEY, WOULD YOU CARE TO BE MY CO-PILOT? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW. OR WHEN. DEFINITELY NOT IN THE STARCRUISER. MAYBE TONIGHT. OR NOT. SOON. MAYBE. NORMAN, ARE WE OKAY? ALL I KNOW IS THAT I LOVE YOU. [DEEP BREATH] THEN THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. [PAGES RUSTLING] HUH. NO. NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT PATIENCE IN CASE OF A BREAKDOWN. GUESS I WAS, UH, COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THAT. I'M VERY SORRY. I WAS OUT OF LINE. THE RV OVERHEATED AND SO DID I. I FORGIVE YOU. BUT WHY? WELL... OH, MY GOSH. IT CAN'T BE! THE ROADSIDE STORE! THAT WAS IT. THAT WAS IT! [♪♪] MELVIN'S MELONS. HUH! YES, WELL, BEING FROM THE EAST COAST, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE THAT COLORADO IS FAMOUS FOR ITS CANTALOUPE AND HONEYDEW. YEP. SOMEHOW, I MISSED THAT. [PHONE CHIMES] UH, I GUESS NORMAN IS ON TO SOMETHING. [NORMAN]: RIGHT, UH... HERE. YEAH, THEY WERE PROBABLY PARKED RIGHT HERE WHEN THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN. [♪♪] DO YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT? I'M NOT HUNGRY. I WANT DADDY. STAY IN THE CAR. [♪♪] [SNAP] -HI THERE. -HI. THAT GONNA BE ALL FOR YA? THAT'LL DO IT. [REGISTER BEEPING] THAT'S $15.75. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M, UH... NOT GONNA GET THESE. OKAY. [REGISTER BEEPING] $10.25. I HAVE A QUARTER HERE, SOMEWHERE. [HONKING REPEATEDLY] MOMMY! LET'S GO! LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A TIRED LITTLE BOY OVER THERE. YEP. LONG TRIP. WELL... TELL YOU WHAT. [CASH DRAWER RUMBLES SHUT] SOMETIMES GUMMIES MAKE THE RIDE GO FASTER. YOU'RE VERY KIND. THANK YOU. WHERE'RE YOU HEADED? YOU KNOW... [SIGHS] I'M NOT REALLY SURE ANYMORE. THANK YOU. YEAH, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE HER. DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT HER? UH, SHE HAD A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS TIRED OF BEING IN THE CAR AND HE WAS GIVING HIS MOM A PRETTY HARD TIME. DID SHE TELL YOU THAT HE WAS HER SON? NO, BUT HE CALLED HER "MOMMY." DID SHE MENTION WHERE SHE WAS GOING? NO, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY'D BEEN TRAVELING FOR A WHILE, AND, UH... YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A GUESS, BUT I THINK SHE WAS RUNNING LOW ON CASH. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS PLACE? [LAUGHS] I SURE DO. THAT'S MINNIE'S CAFE. I STOP THERE EVERY FRIDAY TO GO TO THE BANK IN MONTROSE. MINNIE'S, YOU SAID? OH. MY CELL PHONE DIED. I THINK I LEFT MY CHARGER IN THE D.L.O. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE USE THOSE THINGS. I LIKE MY WORDS ON PAPER. PRECISELY MY SENTIMENT. EXCUSE ME, SIR? UH, COULD YOU TELL US WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND MINNIE'S, PLEASE? SURE CAN. YEAH. YOU STAY WEST ON U.S. 50. IT'S ABOUT 15 MILES PAST PONCHA SPRINGS. MAKE SURE YOU TRY MINNIE'S APPLE PAN PIE. BEST IN THE STATE. NORMAN LOVES PIE! YES. I DO. [RITA LAUGHS] PLEASURE MEETING A MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW SHE'S HIS MOTHER. AND YET WE CAN'T BE SURE THAT MAKES HIM SAFE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THE BOY HAS BEEN TAKEN, BUT WHAT IF HE'S BEEN RESCUED? OH, SO WE KNOW RACHEL IS HIS MOM, BUT MAYBE SHE'S... RUNNING AWAY FROM A BAD SITUATION. YEAH. SORRY! I JUST HAD TO BUY SOMETHING. A MAP. SHOCKING, I KNOW. YOU HAVE YOUR LAPTOP. WELL, I LOST MY HOTSPOT. EXCUSE ME? NO MOBILE INTERNET, SO NO LAPTOP CONNECTION, SO NO GPS. HENCE, THE MAP. WHO ARE YOU? AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH SHANE MCINERNEY? OH, DON'T WORRY. SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH RITA YET? I BELIEVE YOU NEED A DISTRACTION. YOU SAID YOU HAVE A LEARNER'S PERMIT, YES? UH, YEAH. I RENEW IT EVERY YEAR. I JUST DON'T USE IT, BUT... HMM. [GASP OF REALIZATION] [♪♪] YOU'VE GOT THIS, NORMAN. JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

I AM SO HUNGRY. AGAIN! [RITA LAUGHS] [SHANE]: ME TOO. WELL, EXCEPT FOR THAT MINOR HICCUP WITH THE SIGN, AND THE MATTRESS IN THE ROAD, WHICH NO ONE COULD'VE PREDICTED, I THINK YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB, NORMAN. WELL, THANK YOU. IT FELT PRETTY GOOD. SCARY... BUT GOOD. WELL, AS YOUR WISE GRANDMOTHER ONCE TOLD ME-- "YOU HAVE TO FACE THE SCARY." LIKE WITH RITA. LIKE WITH RITA. [♪♪] THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PLACE. WE SHOULD FIND THE EXACT TABLE. MM-HMM. [♪♪] [♪♪] THIRD TABLE'S A CHARM. THAT'S GONNA BE $4.38. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND MY WALLET. I'M IN NO RUSH, HONEY. TAKE YOUR TIME. I HAD IT WITH ME ON THE ROAD... I THINK IT FELL OUT OF MY BAG. [VOICE WAVERING]: I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. HONEST. MY-MY WALLET... [SOBBING]: EVERYTHING'S GONE. I'VE LOST EVERYTHING, HAVE YOU BEEN DRIVIN' FOR A LONG WHILE NOW? ABOUT 10 MILES UP THE ROAD, THERE IS A LITTLE LODGE. SUMMITS POINT. THEY HAVE NICE, CLEAN ROOMS. [SIGHING] BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. WHEN YOU GET THERE, YOU TELL CARL THAT MINNIE SENT YOU. HE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU. I CAN'T. YOU WILL. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU. YOU JUST STAY STRONG FOR THAT LITTLE MAN OF YOURS. THERE. FOR TONIGHT. WON'T SOLVE ANY OF YOUR TROUBLES, BUT... MAYBE, FOR A MOMENT, YOU CAN SET THEM ASIDE. AND SOMETIMES A MOMENT IS ALL THAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO GO TO NEXT. [♪♪] WELL, THE WAITRESS DOESN'T RECOGNIZE ANYTHING, BUT SHE'S NEW. OHH. HERE YOU GO, FOLKS. [RITA]: THANK YOU. UH, WE WERE HOPING YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A WOMAN AND HER SON. I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH TO GO ON... AND WE THINK HE'S 5 TO 10 YEARS OLD-- AND THEY SAT IN THIS VERY BOOTH THREE WEEKS AGO. WE WERE HOPING YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THEM. WE GET A LOT OF FAMILIES STOPPIN' BY. WE'RE THE ONLY RESTAURANT IN A HUNDRED MILES, SO. HE WAS WEARING A DINOSAUR BACKPACK. OH, AND THEY WERE DRIVING A GRAY CAR. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE? [SIGHING] THAT'S ALL WE HAVE, I'M AFRAID. ARE THEY IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? SORRY. IT'S GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. WE'RE NOT AT LIBERTY TO DIVULGE ANY FURTHER DETAILS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU-- YES, I KNOW. I REMEMBER THEM. REALLY? MM-HMM, MM-HMM. NICE LADY. LITTLE BOY. LOVED DINOSAURS. DID THEY MENTION WHERE THEY WERE GOING? UH, YES. UM... DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT IN, UH, IN GRAND JUNCTION. I-I EVEN GAVE 'EM ONE OF THOSE BROCHURES BY THE DOOR. OH, MY GOODNESS. CAN YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL? UH, NO, NOT REALLY. JUST THAT THEY WERE VERY HAPPY AND HUNGRY. LIKE YOU FOLKS, RIGHT? [ALL LAUGHING] WHAT CAN I GET YA? [♪♪] [OLIVER]: WELL, IT MAKES SENSE. RACHEL'S LITTLE BOY LOVES DINOSAURS, AND THE DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT IS ESSENTIALLY ONE RIGHT TURN AT THE END OF U.S. 50, BUT IT'S AT LEAST FOUR HOURS AWAY. [♪♪] NORMAN... THAT'S YOUR THIRD PIECE OF PIE. HOW CAN YOU STILL BE HUNGRY? [RITA]: NORMAN LOVES PIE! ALL THAT DRIVING REALLY TOOK IT OUT OF ME. YOU DROVE 13 MILES. I THINK WE'RE ALL TIRED. WHY DON'T WE FIND A MOTEL AND GET SOME REST? WE'LL DRIVE BACK TO DENVER IN THE MORNING AND DECIDE WHERE TO GO FROM THERE. WAIT. WE'RE NOT GONNA GO SEE THE DINOSAURS? WELL, LET'S BE HONEST. RACHEL AND HER BOY CAME THROUGH THREE WEEKS AGO, AND THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE BY NOW. ALL WE HAVE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE LETTER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITHOUT A SOLID LEAD AS TO THEIR NEXT STOP. THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO PRAY FOR ONE. [♪♪] [RITA]: WHAT'S IN THE BAG? [NORMAN]: THE LAST PIECE OF PIE. [SHANE]: YOU ACTUALLY LEFT ONE? I SAVED IT FOR RITA. [SHANE]: THAT'S SWEET. WE WERE FORTUNATE. THERE WAS STILL ONE ROOM AVAILABLE. YOU AND RITA MAY TAKE THE ROOM. NORMAN AND I WILL, UH, SLEEP IN THE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. [CHUCKLING] OLIVER O'TOOLE, MAN OF COURAGE. OH, COURAGE TAKES MANY FORMS, MS. MCINERNEY. [LAUGHS] WANNA TAKE A WALK? YES. OKAY. [SHANE SIGHS] HOW DO THEY DO IT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, SOMETHING'S GOING ON BETWEEN THOSE TWO THAT THEY HAVEN'T WORKED OUT YET, BUT... THEY STILL HOLD HANDS AND... THEY DON'T LET WHATEVER IT IS PULL THEM APART. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? NO. DO YOU? YES. SO? OH, I'M NOT TELLING. [LAUGHING] GOOD. I'D BE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU IF YOU DID. WAS THAT A TEST, MS. MCINERNEY? [LAUGHS] NO. I HATE TESTS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S HOW A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS END. YOU FAIL SOMEONE ELSE'S TEST THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE TAKING. WE ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP, AREN'T WE? UH, I'M GONNA GO WITH... "YES". THEN I NEED TO ASK A QUESTION. OKAY. WHO IS ALEX BRIGHTON? YOU SAW MY PHONE. YES. IF I... TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT READY TO TALK ABOUT IT YET... WILL YOU TRUST ME? [SIGHS] YES. [QUIETLY GASPS AND SIGHS] CAN WE STILL HOLD HANDS WHILE I'M WORKING THINGS OUT? SHANE... I'M NOT LETTING GO. [♪♪] [OVERLAPPING]: YOU WANNA TALK--? [RITA]: NO, I-- YOU GO FIRST. [NORMAN]: NO. YOU. DO YOU NOT WANT TO MARRY ME ANYMORE? OF COURSE, I WANT TO MARRY YOU. BUT YOU DON'T WANT A FAMILY NOW? YOU DON'T WANT CHILDREN? I DO. MORE THAN ANYTHING. I JUST THINK THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE, UM... MY CHILDREN. [LAUGHS] WHAT? BUT WHOSE ELSE WOULD THEY BE? I NEVER KNEW MY FATHER, AND I BARELY KNEW MY MOTHER, AND THE ONLY LIVING RELATIVE THAT I KNOW OF IS MY GRANDMOTHER, AND SHE'S REALLY SMART. LIKE YOU. AND FUNNY. LIKE YOU. AND KINDA WEIRD. OH. SHE JUST SEES THE WORLD FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. USUALLY ON THE TOP OF MACHU PICCHU, WEARING AN ALUMINUM CROWN THAT TRANSLATES THE RAYS OF THE SUN INTO HAIKU BRAINWAVES. [LAUGHS] SHE REALLY IS ONE OF A KIND. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF SHE ISN'T? YOU KNOW, WHAT IF I'M LIKE HER, TOO? SHE TOLD ME THAT MY MOM DID SOME PRETTY ODD STUFF. AND ALL THROUGH SCHOOL, THE KIDS MADE FUN OF ME FOR BEING ODD. YEAH, BUT THOSE WERE BULLIES, NORMAN. THEY COULD ONLY SEE THE DIFFERENT, THEY COULDN'T SEE THE AMAZING. I'M NOT AMAZING. I'M NOT EVEN NORMAL. IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING. LIKE, I CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT CARS, I CAN EVEN FIX CARS, BUT ACTUALLY DRIVING THROWS ME, AND I CAN'T PASS THE DRIVER'S EXAM. THERE'S ALL THOSE LANES, AND I NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE, AND THEN THERE'S MERGING AND YIELDING. WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT A MAN IF HE CAN'T PARALLEL PARK? NORMAN, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. YOU CAN INVENT MAIL RECOVERY PROTOCOLS THAT NOBODY HAS EVEN IMAGINED. YOU CAN DEVELOP OLD CAMERA FILM, AND YOU CAN INVENT NEW CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS. YOU CAN ANALYZE THE HANDWRITING ON A HOPELESSLY RIPPED AND MANGLED ENVELOPE WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED. YOU HAVE SPECIAL GIFTS. AND NOT EVERYONE WILL SEE THAT, BUT OLIVER SURE DID. THAT'S WHY HE ASKED YOU TO BE A PART OF HIS TEAM. THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE SPECIAL. I'M DIFFERENT. AND I'VE PAID A PRICE FOR THAT, AND I DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN TO HAVE TO. SO... I THINK WE SHOULD ADOPT. OH. [QUIET CHUCKLE] NORMAN... I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WE WERE GOING TO ADOPT. I PLAN ON HAVING A WHOLE RAINBOW OF BABIES WITH YOU, AND I DON'T CARE HOW THEY COME TO US. BUT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, THEY WILL BE LIKE YOU... BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THEY WILL INHERIT FROM YOU WILL COME FROM YOUR HEART, NOT YOUR D.N.A. YOU ARE THE SWEETEST, KINDEST, MOST LOYAL PERSON I HAVE EVER MET. AND THAT'S THE MAN THAT I WANT FOR THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN. THE MAN WHO SAVES THE LAST PIECE OF THE BEST PIE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. AND THE ONE WHOSE HEART CAN BREAK FOR A LITTLE LOST BOY, AND HE WON'T GIVE UP UNTIL HE KNOWS HE'S SAFE. THANK YOU. AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR DINOSAUR BOY. I KNOW. BUT I WAS ALSO TALKING ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE SAFE NOW, NORMAN. YOU'RE NOT THAT BOY YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. I MEAN, YOU NEVER REALLY WERE. IT JUST TOOK A LITTLE BIT LONGER FOR YOU TO BE APPRECIATED. YOU... WERE BORN THE BOY WHO WOULD GROW UP AND MARRY ME. THE NORMAN THAT I WAS MEANT TO LOVE, AND THE MAN THAT ALL SORTS OF CHILDREN WILL LOVE AND CALL THEIR DADDY, THE SMARTEST MAN THEY WILL EVER KNOW. [♪♪] WE'VE GOT A PLACE TO STAY, SWEETHEART. I THOUGHT WE LOST OUR MONEY. WE DID. BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY... [VOICE CRACKS]: ...NICE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. LIKE THE MAN WHO GAVE YOU THE GUMMIES, AND THE LADY WITH THE PIE. AND THE MAN AT THIS MOTEL. [SOBS SOFTLY] WE'VE GOT A PLACE TO STAY, BABY. [CRIES]: AT LEAST WE'RE OKAY FOR TONIGHT. DON'T CRY, MOMMY. I'M SO SORRY, DANNY. I KNOW HOW TIRED YOU ARE, AND I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU MISS DADDY. I WISH I KNEW HOW TO FIX EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW. I'M SORRY. I WON'T ASK ABOUT DADDY ANYMORE. I PROMISE. NO. NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, HONEY. AND I PROMISE, AS SOON AS I CAN, WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING SPECIAL. I'M GONNA TAKE YOU TO SEE THE DINOSAURS. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT? I KNOW IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS DADDY, BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT FOR THAT, OKAY? OKAY. I LOVE YOU, DANNY. I LOVE YOU TOO, MOMMY. [RACHEL SNIFFLES] [♪♪] WHO DO YOU BELONG TO? HMM? [TAKES A DEEP BREATH] [SIGHS] SO I'LL TAKE THE FIRST LEG BACK TO DENVER, AND THEN, NORMAN, DO YOU WANT TO DRIVE? OH, CAN WE STOP AT MINNIE'S FOR PIE? I NEED ONE FOR THE ROAD. AND I MEAN I NEED ONE PIE. ONE WHOLE PIE. [RITA LAUGHS] WELL... WE DIDN'T END UP ACCOMPLISHING WHAT WE WANTED TO ON THIS TRIP, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT JUST TO SEE THOSE TWO HAPPY. [RV FIRES UP] IT WAS WORTH IT JUST TO SEE YOU SURVIVE 12 HOURS WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS. [LAUGHS] VERY FUNNY. OLIVER? HMM? LOOK. OH, MY GOODNESS. [♪♪] SEE? IT'S THE SAME LOG. [SHANE]: THEY WERE HERE! [OLIVER]: IT WOULD SEEM SO. MAYBE THIS TIME SHE FILLED OUT A REGISTRATION CARD. -CHECKING OUT? -YES. AND WE HAVE A QUESTION. [CLERK]: SHOOT. ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, A LADY NAMED RACHEL AND HER LITTLE BOY STAYED HERE, WE THINK. THEY HAD A GRAY CAR. HUH. NOBODY LIKE THAT. ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE WE HAVE A PHOTO THAT PROVES THEY WERE HERE. OH, YES, UH... I DO REMEMBER. UH... PRETTY LADY, ABOUT 35, MAYBE? GRAY CAR. -OH. -LET ME SEE. SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO MESA VERDE. YEP, DOWN TO DURANGO, BECAUSE THE LITTLE BOY WANTED TO SEE THE NATIVE AMERICAN RUINS. DURANGO? MM-HMM. YEP. YOU TAKE THE 50 WEST AND THE 550 SOUTH. BUT THAT WAS THREE WEEKS AGO, AT LEAST. THEY'RE PROBABLY-- ...LONG GONE BY NOW? THANK YOU. THANKS. DURANGO? THERE'S NO DINOSAURS IN DURANGO. AND IT'S COMPLETELY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HE SEEMED SO SURE. BUT SO WAS MINNIE AT THE DINER. EVERYONE SEEMS AWFULLY "SURE". CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PICTURE FROM THE DINER AGAIN? RACHEL, PRESUMABLY PAYING FOR HER BILL, [SIGHS] MENU BOARD... "HELP WANTED," SOME PLAQUE-- WHAT DOES THAT SAY? OH, HERE. UH... OH. "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF." MM. WORDS TO LIVE BY. "HELP WANTED..." HMM. [NORMAN]: WHAT? WELL, THE MAN AT THE ROAD STAND SAID THAT RACHEL SEEMED AS IF SHE WERE RUNNING OUT OF CASH. IF THAT WERE TRUE, SHE COULDN'T AFFORD A CABIN HERE AT THE LODGE. LET ALONE A TRIP TO GO SEE THE DINOSAURS, OR TO GO TO DURANGO. WAIT. SO, IF SHE COULDN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE, AND SHE COULDN'T AFFORD TO STAY, THEN SHE WOULD HAVE-- ARE WE BACK IN THE RACHEL BUSINESS? IT WOULD SEEM SO. DOES THIS MEAN MORE PIE? [♪♪] WELL, LOOK WHO'S BACK. FIND YOUR LADY YET? NO. BUT WE COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT ANOTHER SLICE OF YOUR APPLE PAN PIE. OH, THAT PIE BRINGS EVERYBODY BACK, SOONER OR LATER. SIT WHEREVER YOU LIKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO, UH... OH, PIE? COFFEE? ICE CREAM? ALL OF THE ABOVE. COMING RIGHT UP. WEREN'T THERE, UH, FOUR OF YOU LAST TIME? GOOD MEMORY! SHE'LL BE RIGHT IN. YOU GOT IT. ALL RIGHT. PHOTO, PLEASE. DID WE REMEMBER OUR LITTLE FRIEND? SAFELY TUCKED IN HERE. OLIVER, YOU WERE RIGHT. THERE'S A GRAY CAR PARKED IN THE BACK. "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF." NOW, I BELIEVE THAT MINNIE'S PROBABLY A VERY GOOD SAMARITAN. HER MOTTO'S STILL UP ON THE WALL, BUT THE "HELP WANTED" SIGN IS NOT. I'M GUESSING RACHEL RAN OUT OF MONEY, SHE COULDN'T KEEP STAYING AT THE LODGE, SO MINNIE DECIDED-- THE PIE IS COMING RIGHT UP... AND WE ARE PUTTING EXTRA ICE CREAM ON. THAT'LL HOLD YOU UNTIL YOU GET TO MESA VERDE. UH, DON'T YOU MEAN DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT? YES. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. PROBABLY CONFUSED, BECAUSE CARL FROM THE SUMMITS POINT LODGE CALLED TO TELL YOU HE SENT US IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? [FORCED CHUCKLE] I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK YOU DO. AND SO DOES... RACHEL. DON'T YOU, RACHEL? WE'RE NOT HERE TO UPSET YOU, RACHEL. WE... [RUMMAGES IN BAG] WE JUST WANTED TO RETURN THIS TO YOUR LITTLE BOY AND MAKE SURE THAT HE'S OKAY. BERTIE! MOMMY! YOU FOUND HIM! BERTIE! SO, YOUR MOM SEEMS PRETTY COOL, HUH? YEAH. SHE'S GONNA TAKE ME TO SEE DINOSAURS! BUT JUST THEIR BONES, THEY'RE NOT ALIVE OR ANYTHING. OH. SHE SOUNDS REAL SUPER-COOL. YEAH. MY MOMMY LOVES ME. MY DADDY DOES, TOO. [RACHEL]: EVERYBODY'S GOOD FOLKS AROUND HERE. THEY LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. CARL DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE JUST FROM THE POST OFFICE. I DIDN'T MEAN "JUST". THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ALL WENT TO SO MUCH TROUBLE JUST TO RETURN A TOY. UH, WELL, ACTUALLY, WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO DELIVER A LOST CAMERA. WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE FILM INSIDE, WE FOUND, UH, THIS... [QUIETLY]: OH, DANNY. I WAS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I WAS JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIM. PROTECT HIM... FROM YOUR HUSBAND? FROM THE TRUTH ABOUT MY HUSBAND. WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, JACK WOULD NEVER HURT US. HE WOULDN'T MEAN TO. HE DIDN'T MEAN TO... HE WAS A WONDERFUL FATHER. "IT'S BRIGHT BLUE AND YOU PLAY WITH IT, TOO." [♪♪] "SOLVE THE CASE IN YOUR HAPPY PLACE." [♪♪] I FOUND YOU, DADDY! [LAUGHS] YOU SURE DID, KIDDO! YOU SURE DID. HEY. DO YOU LIKE IT? AND GUESS WHAT? ONE OF THESE DAYS, MOMMY AND I ARE GONNA TAKE YOU TO SEE WHERE SOME OF THEM USED TO LIVE. PROMISE? PROMISE. HOW 'BOUT A SMILE FROM MY BOYS? SAY, "I LOVE YOU, MOMMY." [FELLAS, TOGETHER]: I LOVE YOU, MOMMY! [SNAP] "JACK." [CHUCKLES] WE HAD A "J" AND AN "A," AND AN "M" AND A "K". MY HUSBAND IS JACK MARASHAK. I SEE. THAT'S WHY MINNIE LIED TO YOU WHEN YOU CAME IN LAST NIGHT. YOU SAID YOU WERE FROM THE GOVERNMENT, AND SHE JUST KNEW I COULDN'T HANDLE ANY MORE. UH, MR. MARASHAK WAS MAYOR OF A TOWN IN NORTHERN COLORADO UP UNTIL ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO OR SO. NOW HE'S IN CANON CITY, AT THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. JACK... [SIGHING] ...GOT CAUGHT UP IN SOME SKETCHY PLAN TO INVEST THE CITY EMPLOYMENT PENSION FUND WITH A FINANCIAL GROUP THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A SCAM. THE GUYS HE TRUSTED TOOK OFF WITH THE MONEY AND JACK WAS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. HE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING, BUT HE LOST EVERYTHING. HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK CLOSER THAN THAT. HE DID THE WRONG THING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS, AND HE PAID FOR IT. [SHANE]: AND SO DID YOU. SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE. IT'S A SMALL TOWN. THERE ISN'T ANY PLACE TO GO TO AVOID THE STARES AND THE WHISPERS. AND SCHOOL IS STARTING SOON AND I COULDN'T SEND DANNY BACK TO THAT. YOU KNOW KIDS. [SHE TAKES A DEEP, SHAKY BREATH] SO, I... I PACKED UP MY CAR, I TOOK WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE BANK, AND I TOLD DANNY WE WERE GOING TO A NEW HOME. I THOUGHT I'D FIND SOMETHING NEAR THE PRISON, BUT... ...THE CLOSER I GOT, THE HARDER IT GOT. HOW DO YOU TAKE YOUR LITTLE BOY WHO WORSHIPS HIS FATHER TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT? I KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH, TRYING TO MAKE UP MY MIND, AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT TO CANON CITY, I... JUST KEPT DRIVING. I THOUGHT I'D TAKE HIM TO THE DINOSAUR MONUMENT, BUT I LOST MY WALLET. [SHAKY BREATH] [SOBS]: AND IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MINNIE TAKING US IN AND GIVING ME A JOB, AND... AND DANNY DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT HIS FATHER? I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH. HE... [SNIFFLES] ...THINKS DADDY IS AWAY SOMEWHERE AT A NEW JOB. BASED UPON THE CLUES DANNY LEFT BEHIND WITH HIS CAMERA, ...HE'S, UM, INCREDIBLY BRIGHT. HE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, SOONER OR LATER, I'M AFRAID. I KNOW. I'M JUST PUTTING IT OFF AS LONG AS I CAN JUST TO PROTECT HIM. AND YOURSELF. MAYBE. GOOD PEOPLE DO STUPID THINGS. I KNOW THAT. BUT... YOU LOST YOUR HOME AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR REPUTATION BECAUSE OF WHAT JACK DID. YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU'LL FORGIVE HIM, MAYBE YOU WON'T, BUT, UH... UNTIL YOU CAN FACE HIM, RACHEL... BELIEVE ME, IT... [DEEP BREATH] YOU'LL ALWAYS BE SORT OF IN PRISON YOURSELF. I KNOW, BECAUSE... [DEEP, SHAKY BREATH] [RAGGED SIGH] MY SISTER HAS A GAMBLING PROBLEM. A-- A... BIG ONE. LIKE, SHE GAMBLED HER WHOLE LIFE AWAY, AND, UH... TORE APART OUR FAMILY IN THE PROCESS. [♪♪] WE HAVEN'T, UM... WE HAVEN'T TALKED FOR A LONG TIME, SO... I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL. AND WE CAN TELL OURSELVES THAT WE'RE MOVING ON, BUT, UH... WE DON'T REALLY GET VERY FAR WHEN WE'RE DRAGGING SO MUCH BEHIND US. SO... MAYBE... MAYBE... THERE'S A REASON THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES TOGETHER ON THIS ROAD TODAY. TO HELP EACH OTHER AND... DANNY. [♪♪] SO, I WILL MAKE YOU A DEAL. [SHANE SNIFFLES] IF YOU REACH OUT TO YOUR HUSBAND, I WILL... I WILL REACH OUT TO MY SISTER. [♪♪] YOU'VE... YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED YOUR SISTER BEFORE. HURT TOO MUCH. STILL DOES. BUT NOW YOU KNOW. THOUGHT YOU KNEW ME, RIGHT? UH, I STILL DO. I JUST DON'T KNOW YOUR SISTER. YOU'RE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. YOU'RE SHANE MCINERNEY AND SHE'S, UH... SHE'S-- ALEX. ALEX BRIGHTON. ALL THOSE TEXTS ON MY PHONE, THOSE ARE HERS. SHE'S BEEN IN RECOVERY SINCE LAST YEAR, AND EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE, SHE CALLS AND TRIES TO RECONNECT. BUT YOU NEVER CALL BACK. NOT AFTER WHAT SHE DID TO OUR MOTHER. ALL THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, THE RUINED HOLIDAYS. MY MOM EVEN SOLD OUR HOUSE TO PAY FOR THE DEBT AND TO-- AND TO PUT HER THROUGH REHAB. [TEARFULLY]: MAYBE... MAYBE MY SISTER HAS GOT HER ACT TOGETHER NOW. I'M JUST SO... [FUMING SIGH] I'M STILL SO-- ANGRY? SO ANGRY! I-- I AM SO ANGRY THAT I AM-- I'M AFRAID TO RETURN HER CALLS, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA SAY. SO I JUST DON'T. BUT NOW I HAVE TO. [BITTER CHUCKLE] WHAT WAS I THINKING, MAKING THAT DEAL WITH RACHEL? IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME, BUT NOW I ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IT. YES. BUT... YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALONE, SHANE. [♪♪] [CRIES]: I THOUGHT THE SUN ROSE AND SET WITH HER. THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THAT. EVERYONE ELSE WE JUST HAVE TO FORGIVE FOR BEING HUMAN. [SOBS] [♪♪] [LOCK BUZZING] OKAY, HERE WE GO. [♪♪] YOU CAN GO SEE HIM. I FOUND YOU, DADDY. YOU SURE DID, KIDDO. YOU SURE DID. THANK YOU. HE MISSED YOU. HOW ABOUT YOU? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME, JACK. BUT I GOT THIS FAR... AND I ALREADY KNOW ONE THING-- I LOVE YOU. [♪♪] READY? [DIALING PHONE] [EXHALES SHAKILY] AHEM. ALEX? IT'S ME. [QUIET GASP, VOICE BREAKS]: HI. [LAUGHS] REALLY? WELL, THAT'S, UM... THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? UH, HAVE YOU SEEN MOM? OH. [TEARFULLY]: YEAH, MAYBE AT CHRISTMAS. STILL IN, UM, DENVER. NO, I, UH... I LOVE IT, ACTUALLY. [WHISPERS]: TELL HER... YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND. [QUIET CHUCKLE] [STIFLES A SOB] I, UH... [LAUGHS] I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. [SNIFFS] YEAH, UH... HE'S, UH... ...EVERYTHING I NEVER KNEW I WANTED. "OLIVER." [LAUGHS] I KNOW. [♪♪] SO, THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL WHITE WEDDING CAKE WITH A GANACHE GLAZE. THIS ONE HAS A DELIGHTFUL LEMON CURD. OLIVER LOVES LEMON. AND THAT'S THE CHOCOLATE ONE WITH A CARAMEL FILLING. MM. NOPE. CAN'T HAVE ANY CARAMEL. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE ALLERGIC TO CARAMEL. I'M NOT. I JUST DON'T LIKE CARAMEL. UH, BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS? DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AN APPLE PAN WEDDING PIE FROM MINNIE'S? OOH! MAY I? PLEASE, BE OUR GUEST. MM. UH, SO, WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT? WELL, UH, WE STILL HAVE 76 THINGS TO DO ON OUR "100 THINGS TO DO BEFORE OUR WEDDING LIST," AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. WELL, WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN. NUMBER 43-- "CHOOSE YOUR BEST MAN." NUMBER 44-- "CHOOSE YOUR MAID OF HONOR." YOU'RE THE FIRST FRIEND I EVER HAD THAT TRULY BELIEVED IN ME. YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO STAMP AND SORT AND FORWARD AND DELIVER ALL SORTS OF IMPOSSIBLE THINGS. YOU MADE ME BELIEVE THAT BEING LOVED BY SOMEBODY INCREDIBLE, LIKE RITA, WAS NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE THING. YOU'RE THE BEST MAN THAT I KNOW, OLIVER, AND I'D LIKE YOU TO BE MY BEST MAN. I CAN THINK OF NO PLACE I'D RATHER BE THAN BY YOUR SIDE WHEN YOU MARRY RITA. AND YOU... [CHOKING UP]: WELL, YOU KNOW... YOU'RE LIKE A SISTER TO ME, LIKE THE SISTER I NEVER HAD. BUT EVEN IF I HAD A SISTER, I WOULD STILL WANT YOU TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR. NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST MY REAL SISTER, THAT I DON'T EVEN HAVE... I JUST-- I CAN'T IMAGINE GETTING MARRIED, OR-OR BEING MARRIED, OR RAISING CHILDREN... I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OF THAT WITHOUT YOU. AND NORMAN, OF COURSE! OF COURSE! OF COURSE, NORMAN! OF COURSE! NORMAN! [LAUGHING] [♪♪] SO, UH, WHAT IS QUESTION 45? UM, "DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT "YOU'RE GOING TO FLY, TAKE A TRAIN, OR DRIVE ON YOUR HONEYMOON." OH! LET'S GO TO FIJI! OOH! YES! DO NOT MAIL ME A COCONUT. WHAT? I LOVE SENDING COCONUTS IN THE MAIL! NO COCONUTS. ARE YOU SERIOUS? BUT THAT'S, LIKE-- RAMON? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I LOVE ANYTHING TROPICAL. [♪♪]
