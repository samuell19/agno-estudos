[Wind blowing] [Western music] [Sound of horse galloping in distance] [Horse neighing] Tyler, your dreaming again. Now get off that horse and wake up or we're going to miss the bus! What?! I said, get off that horse and wake up or we're going to miss the bus! How'd you know what I was dreaming about? 'Cause, that's all you ever dream about. What? Now, hurry! (It's going to be the pits, going back to school after having the coolest Christmas vacation a kid could ever have.) (My sister Sam is only seven, but she thinks she's my Mom.) (If you can believe this, her New Years resolution is to make sure I don't miss the bus.) Let me in! Hurry! (Like I need her to help me catch the bus.) (None of my friends except Stoney can believe I put up with Sam.) (But they don't understand, how can you be mean to somebody who risked their life for you?) (She loves me, what can I say?) [western music] [Spurs clanking] (That's Stoney Davis.) (Two weeks ago, we didn't even know each other.) (Now he's my best friend.) (A lot of kids think he's pretty weird, but after what we've been through, I know he's not.) (I'll never forget the first time I saw Stoney.) Teacher: Students, we have a new member of class today. He and his family just moved here. His name is Stoney Davis. Stoney, why don't you tell us where you're from, and a little bit about yourself. Stoney has a surprise for us, he's going to do "show and tell." Thanks. Like the teacher said, my name is Stoney Davis and I'm from the great state of Texas. Down in Texas, I live on a million-acre ranch. I have tons of cattle, and horses. My goal in life is to be the best cowboy in the world. For my "show and tell" today, I brought a rope. Down in Texas, we ride quarter-horses and chase after strays. We rope them right out of the saddle. Strays are called dogies. I could use a little help. You. Come on up here and be my little dogie. [western music] [Whispers instructions] Yeehaw! Go! Stoney: Yeehaw! Students: Wow! Come here, little dogie. Thanks. That's how we do it in Texas. (About a week after Stoney moved here, and just before Christmas vacation, Mrs. Smith showed us a movie.) Today class, we're going to watch a video on the Wild Mustangs of Nevada. Video: Nevada, land of the wild mustang. The world's largest herds of wild mustangs, roam free in the desert wilds of Nevada. The wild animals date back ... [Western music over voice] I couldn't believe it. Millions of horses just running wild. For the rest of the day, all I could think about was wild horses. After school, I just had to ask Mrs. Smith some questions. Mrs. Smith? Tyler. Ya know that movie we saw today about wild horses? Yes. Is it true, I mean are there really wild horses just running around? It's true Tyler. And they don't belong to anybody? No, they don't. They don't belong to anyone. Thanks Mrs. Smith! You're welcome Tyler. Oh yeah, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas Tyler. Hi! Hey, Ty! Where's Mom? She went to the mall. Oh. What are you doin'?S I'm getting ready to go to Jen's. You're going to be back before Christmas aren't you? Yeah, I'm only going to be gone a day and a half. Why can't she come here? She came here last time. It's my turn to go there. You're not going to marry her are you? Mom says she tries to run your life. Is that what Mom says? Yeah. I don't know. We'll have to see what happens. Where does she live? She lives in a little town called Lewis. Where's Lewis? It's in Nevada. [Magical music] Nevada. So, how was school? Ty? (I couldn't believe it.) (It was meant to be.) (My big brother Brad was driving to Nevada.) (The land of the wild mustang.) (But wait, I couldn't catch a horse by myself.) (I needed someone to go with me.) (But who?) (I only had to make a couple phone calls and I found out where Stoney lived.) What are you doing here? How'd you know where I live? Kate Williams told me. I thought you lived on a ranch? We're just staying here until my dad buys the ranch. Ten-thousand acres and six-hundred head of cattle. Are you really a cowboy? And know about horses and all that stuff? Yeah, why? 'Cause if you're really a cowboy, I need your help. What kind of help? How would you like a real live mustang for Christmas? (I told him about my plan.) (How we could sneak a ride with my brother to Nevada) (I told him we could catch two wild mustangs and ride them home for dinner.) (Then I told him I would call him that night.) (On the way home, I felt like I was flying.) Brad on phone: C'mon Jen, they're my parents. I've been away to school for four months. They want me home for Christmas. Listen, we're going to have a great time. Okay, I gotta go. I'm leaving about six o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll get to your place at about ten or eleven. Okay? I'll see ya tomorrow. Okay, bye. [Hangs up phone] Tyler on phone: Hey Stoney, it's me Tyler. My big brother is leaving to Nevada at six O'clock in the morning. Ya gotta be here before that. Here is what you gotta bring: Some rope, and that lasso thing of yours. Some water, a coat, and bring some stuff that horses like to eat. Okay, bye. [Alarm ringing] Tyler and Stoney: Startled gasps Gosh, don't scare me like that. Shh, come on. My brother is going to be here any minute. [Garage door creaking open] Tyler: Shh, I think I hear somebody coming. [Car door opens] [Tyler and Stoney gasp] Where do you think you're going? Answer my question! Where are you going?! I read the note. What's the big surprise you're coming home with? None of your business. Fine, if that's the way you want it. Wait! Where are you going? To tell Mom and Dad. How'd you know we were going some place? I heard everything you said on the phone last night, and I'm coming too! No you're not! Fine, if that's the way you want it. What makes you think you can catch a horse when you can't even catch a bus? You better not tell Mom and Dad! [Garage door creaking open] Hurry, Brad's coming! Tyler and Stoney: Come on! Tyler: (If we knew what was going to happen that day we never would have gone.) [Television news anchor] And now a local interest. J.D. Anderson's prize stallion has done it again. [Man cracking neck] [Television news anchor] Last night in San Francisco, the big horse was awarded National Show Horse of the Year. Haley Brown was on the scene in San Francisco last night. I'm standing here with J.P. Anderson, his granddaughter Andi, and of course the General ... Luke, Luke, come here quick! Our future is on t.v. Ha, ha! [T.V. news anchor] Do you think you'll be back next year? I don't think so Haley. I think it is time to retire. The big fella here he's earned it, we're going to go home and take it easy for awhile. Well congratulations again and we'll see you back home. Thank you. What a beautiful horse. This is Haley Brown in San Francisco. [Toes cracking] [T.V. news Anchor] That beautiful horse is the nations top show horse. That one beautiful horse is purportedly worth ten-million dollars. Today, horse and owner are in route home to Clarkston, Nevada, where a celebration is awaiting them tomorrow. That's the one, and if all goes as planned then we are going to be on our way to Mexico today, with that ten-million dollar horse. When we sell that horse, how much are we gonna make? Ray figures that there is going to be no less than six-million. Which means there three-million for Ray, and there's two-million for me, and then you get a million dollars. How come there's only one-million for me? You consider yourself lucky just to be part of this pal. It's my little Merry Christmas present to you. How come I only heard nine of them? Oh, I can never get that little one on the right foot. [Toe cracks] Oh! It's okay too! [Phone rings] Hello. Get me Luke. How come you always want to talk to Luke and you never can talk to me! Get me Luke. Okay ..., Okay. I'm here. You gotta do something about him. Yeah, yeah. They're on the old highway going southeast. They should be there in less than an hour. Be ready. If you need me, I'm on the cell. They're going to be there in less than an hour and we still got to gas up. Yeah, well I gotta go to the bathroom. Well, we're going to do it at the gas station! [Upbeat country music] ♪ I've been all around ♪ searching up and down ♪ for the right thing. ♪ I even went as far ♪ as looking to the city ♪ for the real thing. [Cell phone rings] Hello. Hey, Jen. Yeah, I'm on my way. Yeah, I've got my seatbelt on. Yeah, I have it with me right now. You want me to go over the whole list? [Sighs] Alright, just one minute. Number one. I got my hair cut, I already told you that. Sideburns are just the way you like 'em. Yeah, I'm sure. He's talking to his girlfriend. I don't like her, she's way too bossy! Oh, brother! Number three. Stand when your Mom walks in the room. Four. Buy your Dad his favorite candy. I got him peanut clusters. I'm kidding, relax. I got peanut brittle. Take it easy! I'm afraid if he ever married her, we would really clash. Jen, wait a minute, you're cutting out. Jen? [Makes static noises] [Fading out voice] Jen? [More static sounds] Number six. That's enough of that. If he really liked her, he wouldn't do that. [Turns up music] I've got to go to the bathroom. Me too. Why didn't you two take care of that before we left? [Cracks neck] I'll go first. I can't hold it any longer. Okay, but no crossing swords. Yeah? We're in some little gas station outside of Clarkston. We'll be there in about fifteen minutes all set up and ready to go. Won't you relax?! This ain't the first time I stole a horse. When we get the horse in the trailer and on the road to Mexico, then I'll give you a call. Gotcha. Uh oh! My big brother Brad is right outside the door. I got an idea, c'mon! Howdy! Billy, you comin'? [Engine problem noises] Why is he stopping? I don't know. Maybe we're in Nevada. It sounds like there's something wrong with the car. I'll look and see. You'll get caught! Relax! What do you see? Nothing. He's got the hood up. [Gasps] What's the matter? Nothing. He didn't see you did he? I don't know. He saw you, didn't he?! Oh, Tyler! Hi. Howdy! What are you doing back here?! Get out of the car! Do you know how dangerous it is being in the back here without any seatbelts?! What if I would have gotten into an accident? We're two hours away from home? What are you doing back here?! Tell him. Tell him. You tell him, it was your idea! Tyler, what's going on?! Well, we were going to catch three wild mustangs, then ride'em home. Mustangs?! Then ride'em home?!S Come on Tyler, I don't have time for this! What am I going to do with you guys now?! Get in the car! Take my phone. I've got to go up to the gas station to buy one of these. Okay? Stay down! Don't move! I'll be right back. You keep the doors locked! Then what's gonna happen? Then, I'm taking you guys home! You're in big trouble with Mom and Dad! Can I ask you a question? What? Are we in Nevada? Yeah, we've been in Nevada for an hour and a half. Now you guys roll the windows up and lock the doors! I'll be back. Need some help? I do. I could really use a ride up to this gas station to buy a new belt. Well what do you think Andi ... think we can trust him? Hmm, maybe. Just this one time. Hop in the front here. Thanks. I have a feeling there's a whole herd of wild mustangs hanging out just right over that hill. Black stallions. White stallions. Just waiting to be caught. Sam ... when is the last time our family came to Nevada? I can't remember. That's because we never come to Nevada, and we never will again. Tyler, what are you thinking? I don't know what I am thinking. I just know we came all this way and I don't want to come home without a horse. I think we better just listen to Brad and stay right here like he told us. Thank you, I appreciate it. We could wait and take you back. Couldn't we Grandpa? Oh, why sure! We go right back that way anyway, the junction's our turn off. That would be great, I'll be right back. Tyler: What if we caught four horses instead of three. Then we could give one to Brad. Good idea. That way, there's no way he would be mad. I wish I knew if he liked girl horses better than boy horses or, what his favorite color is. Guys always like black. Midnight black. C'mon let's go! I really appreciate this, thank you. Glad we could help. It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. See ya. I thought you were going to ask him if you could help? It crossed my mind. Tyler! Sam! It looks like it is our day for good deeds. Let's see if we can help these folks. Why I sure do appreciate you stoppin'. Troubles? There's nothin I got but troubles with that thing. Well, my granddaughter here is a certified mechanic so I am sure we can help you. What do you think the problem is? Well, I think it's probably the carburetor or something. Grandpa! Grandpa! Hey, what are you doing, let her go! You listen! You don't want your granddaughter hurt? You're going to follow the instructions! You understand? We want that horse! We want the cell phone, we want the trailer keys, and we want the truck keys right now! Don't give them anything Grandpa! Tyler! Tyler! [Starts engine] Just in case you get any ideas about goin' anywhere. Easy boy, easy, easy. Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, that's for sure. C'mon, c'mon. Like I said, you'll never get away with this! Hyah! C'mon! C'mon. Go Gen go! Go General boy, go! Go! Go Gen. Go General, go boy, go! Hey get down there! Hold it, hey! Where are you going! Come back here! Dang! Gosh! Why do you keep doing that? It's what the Indians use to do. They could hear a herd of buffalo from five miles away. Do you hear anything? No horses. Just some jack rabbits about a mile off. What happened?! [Sighs] Nothing! Do your thing again. No horses. Maybe we should really go back. Brad's going to be really mad when he finds out we're gone. Let's just go over that next hill. That's what you said on the last three hills! C'mon, just one more. My Grandpa called the Sheriff, he's on his way. I know you'll be anxious to get going and so we'll get a ride home with them. Alright. Any luck getting a hold of your brother and sister? No. They must have the cell phone turned off. [Sighs] This is all my fault! I can't believe I left them in the car alone! Don't worry, you'll find them. I mean, what else could you do? And, thank you so much for your help. You're welcome. Good luck! Thanks! And be careful, it's easy to get lost in the desert. I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. When I go up this road, is it a right or a left? Left. Got it. Ya know, I know the desert really well. Do you want me to come? It could speed things up. You can't do that, what about your horse? Well, my Grandpa has that all under control. Are you sure? That would be great. Okay, I'm going to tell my Grandpa. Where are they? There are supposed to be millions of them! Maybe they are having a nap. I'm starving, I can't go on! All we got left is an apple, some celery, and carrots. I need some real food! Well, it just so happens that I came prepared. Would anyone like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? I've got smooth and crunchy. I'll have smooth and crunchy. What's the magic word? Please. Yeah, please crunchy. It's a good thing that I came, huh? Uhuh. Whoa, whoa. Oh, yeah. They went this way. C'mon! Stoney, hasn't your mother ever taught you to not chew with your mouth open? Sorry. If they only knew what a good home we'd give them. And how much fun we'd have. They'd come running so fast. I know your disappointed but, we really should go back. Where are you?! Come on, let's go back. I was thinking, even if we did catch some horses, where would we keep them? In the garage. Hmm, I never thought about that. Or, as soon as Stoney's Dad buys the ranch, we can keep 'em there. Huh Stoney? Uh huh, sure ... [Horse neighing] (Tyler) King of all the wild mustangs. (Sam) She's so beautiful! Sure glad you know how to use those ropes. C'mon let's go. That's their footprints. Which means they went that way. When I get my hands on those kids their dead. Oh c'mon, their just kids. Just kids, I told them to stay in the car and they go off into the desert. I was supposed to be in Lewis an hour ago. Okay so, wait a sec ... They hid in your car without you knowing it. To come to Nevada to catch some wild mustangs. Yeah, and ride them home for dinner. That is so cute. Sorry. So how old are they? Tyler's 8, Sam's 7, and cowboy kid must be Tyler's age. Hmm, okay. Well that explains it. Explains what? That's normal for little kids. Don't you remember what it was like? Everything and anything is possible. Sit down. Okay, here's the plan. Sam, we're going to get on the other side and scare him towards Stoney. Stoney, when he comes towards you lasso him. and all three of us will grab the rope. I can't. Yes you can, just stand right over there. No, I mean, I really can't. Come on, We got the king of the wild mustangs right here. Your a cowboy remember. Wait a minute Tyler. Stoney, are you afraid? You did all this stuff on your ranch. Stoney, have you been telling fibs? Well I didn't come this far for nothin, gimmie a rope. [Western Music] Go Tyler! You can do it. Driving a black Toyota pickup, pullin an old green horse trailer. Now if you can come up to the ranch with me, I'll give you some pictures of the General for a perfect ID. Okay, can I give you a lift? No, I'm expecting my for.... here he comes now. Sheriff this is my foreman Ray Wilson Ray, this is Sheriff Kirk Smith. Nice to meet you Ray. Howdy. Well I'll see you both up at the ranch. Okay. What's going on? I need to tell you about it Ray. Come on. I almost got him that last time. You'll get him. Sorry, I lied I'm no cowboy. I've never been around a real horse in my whole life. Then why'd you say you'd come? I never thought we would find a real live mustang. What about the ranch in Texas? Your not really from Texas, are you Stoney. Where you from then? Winnemucca, Nevada. Then where did you get the ropes and all the cowboy stuff? My next door neighbor was a rodeo cowboy. One day he fell off his horse and got hurt. He had to quit, he gave me all his stuff. So your dad's not going to buy a ranch. I don't have a dad. You tell fibs because you think it makes you popular, Isn't that right Stoney? Yeah. Well, you don't have to fib anymore. We like you just the way you are. Tyler, Stoney look! Okay, here's the plan. When the horse takes a bite of the sandwich, I'll slip the rope over his head. Tyler, I think Stoney should do this. No, no it's okay, Tyler can do it. Stoney, you do it now. [Western Music] We got him, we got him, a wild mustang! Stoney, I can't believe it you did it! I roped myself a wild mustang. I'm so proud of you. [Music] [laughing] [Laughing], well This is gonna be a whole lot easier than I thought. What you talkin about? You see that little cowboy? Yep. [Both laughing], let's go have a little bit of fun. Howdy. Hi, hi, howdy. So where did ya find my horse? Your horse? He's ours. I roped him myself. We're gonna brand him, so everyone knows he's ours That's right! Well, There's nothing I'd like more than to give you that horse. But, the truth is, that horse is mine. Alrighty. Now this morning he got out of the corral, and I don't know why he just ran off. Me and my buddy have been on our horses since sun up, and we've been lookin' for him. Alright. I'll tell you what, Just because I appreciate y'all, for helping, How about a little reward, huh. What we got here? How about five dollars a piece. Are you sure this horse is yours? Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go Luke, We're burnin' daylight. Come on, I want you guys to take this, come on sweetie. Go on now. [Music] Bye, Beauty. Come on, let's go. [Remembering voices] Would you relax, this ain't the first time I stole a horse. Oh my gosh! They're lying! What? Those guys are bad. That Luke guy lied, I saw him at the gas station. He was talking to someone on his cell phone, He said something about stealing a horse, and he said he's been in the desert since the sun came up. He lied, because I saw him at the gas station. Are you sure it was the same guy? Yes. Oh my gosh! She's right, I saw the other guy come out of the bathroom at the gas station. We're going to get our horse back, you with me? Of course. You comin'? Should be getting home but, good luck. Okay, but, watch out for those coyotes. Let's go. [Coyotes howling] Guys wait for me! Guys wait for me! [Cell phone rings] It's Ray. Yeah. It's me, you got the horse? Yeah, I got him. Good work. Listen their's something I got to talk to you about. What? We just got done chasing this horse down for 3 hours. Both of us about broke our necks. I had to rope him on a dead run. Listen, we've been talking Ray. We figure we both need to get a little more money out of this. What's a little more? 10,000 dollars. 10,000. No way! If you hadn't messed things up back there In the first time around, We'd be half way to Mexico by now. Oh, I'm disappointed in you Ray. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, We'll just turn him loose right now, just forget about the whole thing, how about that. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Okay, you got a deal 10,000 but, not one penny more! Not a penny more. Now, where are you? About a mile an' a half this side of Apache crossing. Now listen to me, In no time at all the cops are going to be looking for you, we got to hide that horse immediately. Now I know the perfect spot. It's not more than a mile from where you are. Have you ever been to Snake Canyon? Yep, I've been there. You know where that huge rock is up there looks like a snake with it's mouth open? Yep. Good. About hundred yards from that snake There's a spot where two rocks meet form a big room. Hide in there. Alright I've been there. Call me when you get there. Woo! We just made a little bit more money, I do believe so. [Excited screams] Hey, guys I found something. What is it? I'm not sure. I think it's a rattle snake rattle. We studied about them in school. Yep, that's what it is alright. Let me see it. I wonder he belongs to. Maybe he's a she. How do you know? Because she's to pretty to be a boy. Oh, brother. [Western music] Look here, Sam never eats her crust. Your right! Look their footprints are everywhere, There's horse footprints,too. What? I think they found the General. How do you know? By the shoe, My grandfather has special shoes made for his horses. Brad, we have to find the kids before those men do. [singing annoyingly] Would you shut up. This place is amazing. [laughing] Look, that's the big snake Where? Right there. Oh yeah, I see it. There's a little cave in there that goes all the way back. Come on let's go. I'll show you where we can get some firewood. Whoa, look at all those holes. Look like a bunch of meteors hit the mountain. It's called corrosion, I just learned about it in my school. Let's go in one of those caves. First we got to save Beauty, come on. [Spooky sounds] Ain't nobody gonna find us here. Last time there were cougar tracks all over the place Cougar tracks, your kidding me. No, I'm not. Ray we're here inside right now. Can't you here that echo. Okay. Why don't you go get some firewood? I'll take care of these horses, alright. So why are you going to Lewis? Oh, that's where my girlfriend lives. Oh, what she like? Uh, she's tall. Kind of looks like you, but, blonde. No, I mean what she like? She's a human day planner, She does not waste a minute. She must spend half her life making to do list. Really? Yeah. Here, look at this. Here's the list she made for me, when I meet her parents Hmm, well I hope your ready for all this. I am. What? I don't know, I just, I'm a little surprised. Surprised at what? Well, you come off so confident, and in control, not someone who needs to be told what to do. I don't need to be told what to do. I'm sure you don't. Nice haircut. Whoa, that was close. No kidding. What are we going to do now? I don't know. What's wrong? I thought I heard something. There's nobody out here. What's the plan? What's the plan is when Ray get's here, we're going to load up them horses,and go to Mexico, and make us some money. [Both laughing] Why do they call this Snake Canyon, because of that big rock out there? No, because this place is crawling with snakes. When I was a kid, and we were up here, It get's hotter than an oven out here, So we crawled in those holes you seen out there, just to try to cool off a bit. Well, I was sitting there one time and right from the ledge above me, something drops in my lap. Snake? Yep. Great big rattler. Head about the size of my fist, just staring right up at me. You've got to be kidding me. Well, what did you do? Nothing, I couldn't move, I was petrified by pure fear. About an hour and a half goes by, that thing just finally crawled off, crawled out of the hole. Be careful. They're scared of fire, ain't they? Like cougars, and snakes? Yeah. Ugh, I hate snakes. [Tyler] Sounds like they're waiting for someone else to come, and then they're taking Beauty to Mexico to sell her. We can't let them do that to Beauty, She'll be to home sick, and die. I know. Well, we can't just go in there, and take the horse. We got to figure a way to get them out of there so we can go in and take the horse. I got an idea, it just might work. Here's what we need to do... Feliz Navidad. You bet, And a Merry Christmas to. Merry Christmas. Hey! You stole that horse, and I'm telling the police. Get him! You go get him! [Indian music] Hey! Hey Mister! [Stoney screams] Karl. Karl! Come on, we got to move fast. Please don't let me die. You get me out of this one, I swear, I'll go clean. As soon as we sell that horse. Hurry! Karl, Where are you? Karl. Here. Come on boy. I don't think he wants to leave the other horses. Karl. I'm right here. What are you doing? Help. Snake. On my back. I see it. Don't move a muscle. Don't scare it. Just relax. What's that? That's the snake that's on your back, What? You're an idiot, you got fooled by kids, their probably back there taking those horses right now. Now come on. Good boy. Tyler, Stoney, their coming! Get out of there now! Hurry. Get that little cowboy. No, ahh Where do you think your going? Go sit down over there. Don't move. I can't stand kids, especially ones taking my horse. [Indian music] I'll get you! I bet your wondering what happened to my eye. [Laughing] Everybody wonders about that. Don't you move. I got my eye on you boy, I got my eye on you. Well I don't know where the kid went. Looks like I'm going to have to find him myself, huh Karl? It's a kid's hide and go seek heaven out there. One minute you think you got'em then they vanish into thin air. You keep your eye on that kid. You just keep your eye on that kid! And you keep your eye on that horse, huh. I'll find that little runt myself. You guys are in big trouble, what do you think your doing? Shhh, they'll here you. What are you talking about? Where is Tyler? The bad guys got him. [Stoney] We got a horse, and then those guy's took it from us. When we went to get it back, Tyler got caught. Tyler's in the cave. What cave? Right in there. They have my little brother, we have to call the police. Where's the cell phone? Tyler has it. Shh, someone's coming, come on, come on. You guys stay here, don't move, we'll be right back. Come on. That's Ray! Who's Ray? He's our ranch foreman, my grandpa must have sent him up here to find us. Why is he driving a moving van? I don't know. Come on. Ray I'm so glad your here, The two guy's that stopped on the highway and tried to steal the General, are in the cave, and they have the horse, there's a little boy in there, we need you to help us. Ray, they're in the cave right now. Keep your hands off me! Ray what are you doing! Let go! Ray let go of me! I'm sorry honey, I'm sorry! [arguing continues] What are we going to do now? I don't know. Where did you find them? Who is he? Found these two out there. Go get a rope, tie these guys up. Where's Sam, and Stoney? They're out there somewhere. Don't worry, they'll save us. Good they left the keys, get in. Just see what you can find. Sam, look. What is it? It's a flare. You light it, and put it on the road at night, when the car breaks down. I think I know a way to get them out of the cave. Tell them your snake story. They don't want to hear the story. I got to make a call. It's me. We got the horse. We'll be leaving here in about 30 minutes. We'll be in that rental truck I told you about. We'll make the switch as planned. I'll be in touch. What did he say? Everything's under control. What about the money? I said everything's under control! [Truck horn blaring] What's that? Somebody in the truck. Cops are going to hear that. Go on! Go see what it is. I bet you it's Sam and Stoney. [Indian music] No, no, hey kid! Let me out of here! Well, I'll go take care of this myself, looks like. Don't you worry about it. Two down, one to go. Karl. Help me Luke, get me out of here. It's locked. You got fooled again by those kids! [Stoney screams] Don't worry, I'm here to help you. [Indian music] Oh, this is hard. It's okay. You can do it. Okay now here's the plan, Stoney.... Oh good there's Stoney now. When I say go, jump up and punch that man right in the nose. What? Don't worry, you can do it. Go! Nice going Brad. Tie him up, then call the police on the cell phone. Come on,come with me and we'll go get Stoney. Come on Tyler, let's go get the rope. Thought you were going to get away with this, huh? You listen up! Let her go. You listen, I want the keys to the truck. and the keys to that padlock, now! [moans in pain] Get him General! Okay, no, no! Get him Beauty. Okay, call him off. Get him Gen. Call him off, call him off! That a boy! [Tyler] When we got finished with Luke, Karl, and Ray, they wished they never thought about stealing that horse. When we got back to the highway, the police were waiting for us. I don't have to dream anymore, because J.P. gave us each our own horse. Now you might be saying to yourself what good is having a horse, that's so far away that you never get to ride it. Well we got lucky again. Brad never made it to Jen's house. Now he spends alot of time at the ranch with Andi. He takes us there any time we want. Bye, see ya. [Tyler] Now you know why I put up with Sam, and why Stoney's my best friend ever. When you go through something like we went through, you just can't help but, be friends forever. Welcome back to class. I hope you had a great time over the Christmas holiday, and that you missed me. Yeah, yeah! And that your ready to get back to work. Boo, boo! Ah, well to start the new year, I have a video to show you called the Wild Llama's of Peru.
