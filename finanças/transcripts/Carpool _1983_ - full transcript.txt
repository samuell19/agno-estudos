[CARS HONKING] RADIO ANNOUNCER: Hi, there, everybody. Looks like it's Monday morning again and time for that old freeway report. Let's see. The Long Beach appears to be loaded, the Simi stuffed, Pasadena plugged, Corona crammed, Santa Monica strangled, Riverside rotten. There's a big bind on Bernardino, mess on the Marina heap on the harbor, glum on the Glendale, and a no-no on the Newport. If that's not bad enough, I'm sad to report that there has been a tragic accident on the San Diego. Tragic. A liquor truck has overturned, bottles have been smashed, stuffs running out all over the place. People out there are jumping from their cars and licking the asphalt, and I can't say that I blame them. Riding those freeways can really do it to you. But let me tell you something, folks. If you've got some friends right in that car with you, maybe it won't be so bad. A few close buddies sitting side by side, sharing that ride, can sure make getting to work a lot mellower.

That's quite an outfit you're wearing. Thanks. I got it down at the... Spare me. She's not there. Who? Jennifer O'Connor. She's supposed to be standing right there. Is she a beatnik? I haven't heard that word in a long time. Hi. I know, your mom told you never get in a car with strangers, right? Well... Well, this is Mr. Brooks here. And I'm Bobby Duff. And you're Jennifer, right?Yes. Ah, we're not really strangers anymore, are we? No, I guess not. What a beautiful car. Why do... Saves energy.It's patriotic. Ah. Are we it? No, one more. Lois Vaughan. Two boys, two girls. Could be interesting. When do we pick Lois? Now, corner of Maple. Corner of Maple, coming up. I don't see her. Just that negro. Haven't heard that word in a long time, either. Wonder what he's waving at? Maybe at us. I certainly hope not. Are you Brooks? Are you Lois? Otis. Otis Vaughan. [GROANS] How you doing?Hi. Hey, this is nice wheels. Why are you... Saves energy. BOTH: It's patriotic. You all know it's $20 each.Yes. Every week. In advance.Right. Some patriotic. [SYMPHONY MUSIC PLAYING] Now listen, 5:30 on the dot. Everyone understand that? It's a long bus ride back to Pomona. Come in, Bobby. [CHUCKLES] You've had a chance to look over the copy, haven't you, Bobby? Yes.Ah. Did you have time to formulate an approach? Well, I...WOMAN: Oh... Try to think of it as sort of an inward nobility trying to share a negative experience in order to help another human being. Uh, can you work with that? I... I think so. All right. When you're ready.Ah. Gas pains? Sure, I get them from time to time. MAN: Too young! He's way too young. Oh, and, too... Too mean. Sorry. Ah! Thanks for coming in, Bob. We will let you know.I'm quite older... Maybe an oriental. You know I did The Mikado in high school. Well, not the singing part.MAN: That's an idea. MAN 2: Oriental.MAN 1: Oriental! [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [COUGHS] [COUGHS] Oh, hello, Mr. Winston? Yes. This is Wendell Brooks of Carnegie Investments Limited. Yes, sir. I'm very sorry to bother you at home, but I'm very anxious to share with you a wonderful opportunity to invest in semiprecious hedges... Semiprecious stones as a hedge against inflation. Yes, sir, that's Carnegie Investments. Semi...[PHONE DISCONNECTS] MAN: Missed again, huh, Brooks? You know you're barely covering your phone bill. It'll be all right. It's going to be really good now. [DIALING] I have confidence. Hello, Mr. Wergstein? This is...[PHONE DISCONNECTS] RIDGEWOOD: Ah, Miss O'Connor. Hey. You... You wanted to see me? Yes, I did. I think you'd best sit down. Oh. I'm afraid I won't be able to recommend you for graduate school. But, why? My, my grades are... Well, I... I just don't think you'd be a very good candidate for clinical psychology. But I... I want to help people. Miss O'Connor, I don't think you can help people unless you know something about people. I get the feeling you've never had any close intimate contact with people. Oh. I see. You do? Yes. You want some close intimate contact with me. What? Sexual favors, that's what it's called, isn't it? Miss O'Connor, if you'd bother to check my background, you'd know that I'm a happily married man. I'm a grandfather! Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Have you ever thought of becoming a nun? Dr. Ridgewood, if you'd bother to check my background, you'd know I used to be a nun. [GROANS] Nice punch, champ. Ooh. Ooh. Yeah, I didn't hurt you, did I? No. No. [PANTS] Man, do you like being a human punching bag? Hey, man, the money's good. Eh! You're gonna be the richest guy in the cemetery. I mean, you work all night, and then you come in here and... Hey, Tigo, I'm just trying to get ahead, okay? Yeah, I think you're trying to get a busted head. Look, how much longer are you going to do this? Until something big happens that changes my life. Like what, man? I don't know, I don't know, but somewhere out there, there's something good and it's coming my way. [WHISPERS] I can feel it. Okay, Mr. Feeney, sign please. Yeah. And don't spend it all in one place, hear? Sure, rookie, sure. Bye, boys. Looks like it's going to rain any minute. Let's see if we can beat it. Count up, Feeney. [THUNDER CRACKING] Hey, couldn't you pick a more scenic route? I'm sorry it displeases you. For your information, I'm trying to avoid the interchange traffic. The problem was caused because Little Lord Fauntleroy back there was 15 minutes late. He said he was sorry.[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Say, let's listen to some music with a little more life to it. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] I like that. No, man. Uh-uh. [RELIGIOUS HYMN PLAYING] I like that. You've got to be kidding. That's boring. [SCOFFS] [SOUL MUSIC PLAYING]Ow! Yeah. Now, that's music. Whoo! [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] This relaxes me for the arduous drive we are now forced to make. You want me to take the wheel? Don't be ridiculous. Hey, man, I wasn't trying to be ridiculous. I was only trying to help! Yeah. All he really said was that he... Look, I can handle this. Say you shouldn't be like...[INDISTINCT TALKING] This is my car and I'll do the driving! And I'll go the way I want, and listen to the music I like! Let's get that settled right now. Does anyone disagree with that? Yeah. I disagree with that. So, as soon as you drop me off today, it's going to be the last you're going to be seeing me. Fine with me. It'll make for a much quieter ride. You're being unfair. I think you just talked yourself out of a ride, young lady. Don't you think he's being unfair? Well, yes and no. Look out! [BANGS][TIRES SCREECHING] JENNIFER: Stop! Maybe he's hurt. He looks fine. JENNIFER: How can you see anything through that window? Uh... Maybe we should go back. Go back? And miss leaving the scene of an accident? Accident? What accident? Besides, it was his fault just as much as it was mine. You look out! [TIRES SCREECHING] Say man, you been driving long? You want to get off right here? Not me, I used to live in this neighborhood. Stop. What's that? Something fell out of that truck.What is it? Only one way to find out. [PANTS] A little peek can't hurt, huh? No. You shouldn't do that. [FABRIC TEARING] Oh, no. Well? It feels green. [GRUNTS] It's green, all right. It's hundreds! There's usually a hundred bills in the stack. Listen. You mean to tell me that I'm sitting here with $10,000 in my hand? Oh, my! My, oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my! Whoo! It's all hundreds.Oh, no. Are they new bills? I mean, are there serial numbers in all of them? No, no. They're used. Real used. Oh, boy. I know what you're thinking. Yes, and I know what you're thinking but you just better stop it because this money doesn't belong to us. Well, nobody said it does. Nobody says it doesn't. Haven't you ever heard of "Thou shalt not steal"? Haven't you ever heard of "Finders keepers, losers weepers"? I've heard of that. JENNIFER: Why are we just sitting here? WENDELL: We are sitting here so we can talk about it. JENNIFER: But we've been here for 15 minutes and no one's said a word. OTIS: Hey, you think it's going to start to rain again? JENNIFER: That's not what I mean. ROBERT: Look, why don't we just go home? JENNIFER: We can't go home until we talk about it! ROBERT: Okay. It's $970,000. What do we do with it? We return it. To who? To the people it belongs to. Why?For the reward, right? Reward. I never thought of that. That's...Wait. Wait a minute! How can there be a reward, when those turkeys don't even know it's gone? That's right. Maybe taking the money back now would be foolish! All we'd get is a hearty handshake, thank you, and good-bye! Now you're talking. Besides, I didn't catch the name of the armored car company. Did any of you? Not me.Oh, gee, I didn't either. So what do we do? Wait till they post the reward. Then we come forward, like good citizens. Well, what are we gonna do with it until then? Well, that's not a problem. I'm used to handling large sums of money. So, I'll simply take it home with me and then when... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute, Jack. Hold down. Something wrong? Yeah. I don't know you. And I don't know you! And I'd like to keep it that way. But in the meantime, in-between time, I don't wanna be responsible for what you're going to do with that money. Like what?How's bug out? That's preposterous!But I know what he's saying. I mean, we can't just give the money to you. Why not? 'Cause you got shifty eyes. So what do we do? I'm the oldest...Well, I think it's ridiculous that we're discussing this.I'm the most responsible. This money isn't ours!You people are all young... Wait a second. I got it. I got it! Why don't we divide it up? Huh? Each of us take part of it home. That way, if any of us gets any ideas, the others won't be responsible. Sounds good.ROBERT: I'll buy it. Uh, I don't, uh... [STUTTERS] No, I can't. [MUMBLES]What's wrong? No, I, uh... Well, just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm gonna faint. Like you going to faint? Yeah. I can't take the money. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Well, let's try a little experiment. [SIGHS] Here's $10,000. You're going to faint? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Well... Well, I... Here's $40,000. You're going to faint? I don't know. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Well, here's $80,000. Now you're going to faint, huh? A-ha! [JENNIFER SNICKERS] What's so funny? I don't know. It's so big. That's what I thought. MAN: Where the hell you've been, Otis? I had car trouble. Car trouble, huh?Yeah. Yeah, well, this place has gotta be finished in two weeks. You got all the plumbing, the electrical, the drywall... Hey, man, it will be. Only it'd be nice if you'd pay me a little something. Pay you?Yeah. Pay you? Are you kidding? Look, I'm getting you in the union. And that's the deal. And besides, you're living here free in comfort. Hmm. By the way, Otis, those furnace parts got here, put 'em in tonight and you'll have heat. Rosanna! Are... Are you... I'm going. Back to St. Theresa's? No. I'm afraid not. Then where? Just... Away. [CHUCKLES] All by yourself? But, Rosanna, it's a dangerous world out there. [HORN HONKS] That's him! You're going away with a man? With a man? Jennifer, I know, you won't understand right away. Maybe someday?Oh. No, but who's gonna pay your half of the rent? I got to run! Good-bye, Jennifer!Good-bye! [CHUCKLES] Have a good time. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] WOMAN: Wendell, is that you? Yes, Anita. ANITA: What kept you so long? Traffic. Are you coming up? Yes! Yes! I'm on my way, dear. [CLOCK RINGING] Why did you bring that upstairs for? I don't want you cluttering up my room with all your junk. Well, it's my room, too. Don't get smart with me, Wendell. This house was left specifically to me by my father, as well as the car I let you drive. Even the clothes on your back belong to him. You were very lucky you wore the same size. Some luck. Running this house costs a fortune. Running that car costs a fortune. Why the hell didn't he leave us some cash? Wendell, where are you going? Uh, downstairs. I just wanna watch the news. Before you fix my dinner? WOMAN: Well, we have to do something. MAN: But he's your own brother. Half-brother. And until he dropped in on us six months ago, I hadn't seen him since he was four. What's the difference? The difference is that you're down to working a three-day week... And I can't...We still have some money in the bank. Money that we sweated for. He hasn't earned a dime in the whole he's been here. He's wrecked my car twice. A little dent. I want him out of here. Now are you gonna tell him or not? [KNOCKING ON DOOR]Come on in. Hi. Have you been home long? No, a while. You must have heard that. You know, I really got to start paying some rent around here, buying some groceries.Look, Bob, I mean, you know your sister's not been feeling too hot for a while I think she's going through the change. Well, the truth is, you know I feel like we ought to have some time for ourselves. Look, here's $62. It's all I got. Tomorrow morning, I think you better look for someplace else to live. Good luck, kid. Thanks. [SOUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLUTTERS] Ow, ow, man! [GROANS] Ooh! ♪ To the clouds ♪ High in the sky ♪ It is so peaceful ♪ There's no trouble anywhere ♪ I want to climb that stair someday ♪ ♪ The sound ♪ Of you can be ♪ I need a friend ♪ To tell it all to ♪ There's no one here ♪ But me ♪ I have always kept my sorrow ♪ Deep inside me ♪ Only somehow it's time ♪ To start [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] ANITA: Wendell, you're keeping me awake! What are you doing? Uh, just watching the late news! You've been watching the news all night. What do you expect to see? Wendell, lights out! WENDELL: All right, Anita. All right. Pleasant dreams, Wendell. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Are you getting in? You're early, aren't you? So are you. WENDELL: At least there's two of us. It appears there are three of us. You're early. Because we're good, clean, honest Americans. Three out of four's pretty fair, I'd say. You think Otis will be there? You said it. I didn't. Did you hear anything on the news last night? I don't have a radio. Or a television. I stayed for the 11 o'clock. There was nothing on that. Strange, isn't it? As strange as that. How come you're early? What are you doing here? Just getting ready to collect my share of the reward. Where do we line up? So, you haven't heard anything, either? Look, it's gonna be very difficult to take this money back if we hold... ROBERT: Look! The morning paper. WENDELL: Maybe there will be something. Let me grab one. WENDELL: What's he doing? JENNIFER: Why doesn't he just buy one? ROBERT: He's coming back. WENDELL: Without a paper? Anybody got a quarter? See, I didn't think it was wise asking the guy if he had change for $243,000. Let's all pitch in. "Police suspect that yesterday one of the slickest armed-car robberies "in the city's history took place. "Shortly after 5:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon, "an armored car from the Inner Security Company "was attacked near the corner of 8th and Union. "When someone threw a Molotov cocktail at it." What's a Molotov cocktail? Uh, it's kind of a fire bomb. "The driver and two guards escaped injury by jumping from the truck. "The damage was slight but this morning it was determined "that some of the contents..." Well, what, what? What does it say?[MOANS] "Notably, a bag containing $970,000 was missing." That can't have anything to do with us. We weren't within 10 miles of 8th and Union. "Police say that since a fire bomb was used in the crime, "it is being classified as an armed robbery. "An investigation is now in progress." ROBERT: It had to be the same armored car. Why did they think it was an armed robbery? ROBERT: Well, they probably discovered the money was missing and had to blame on something. Then we'll just have to them when we take it back. OTIS: I'm not sure we want to do that. Why not? There's bound to be a reward. Sure. "For information leading to the arrest and conviction of." Which in this case would be us. Why don't we just mail it to the police anonymously. That's a good idea. If we do that, we'll miss out on the reward. What if we just kept it all? There's your answer. We can't. That's immoral. This is a question of morality? Apparently, not with you. Now somebody is out that money. She's right.WENDELL: No, no, no! Don't you see... Look. The armored car company is responsible because they were in possession of the money. So they have to pay it back to whoever it belongs to. But they have insurance. So doesn't cost them anything. Now the insurance company, they just deduct the losses from their taxes. In the end, no one loses. Sounds good to me. Sounds good to me, too. No. Doesn't sound good to me. We didn't earn that money. It doesn't belong to us. Oh, you mean it didn't belong to us. I don't know. Maybe she's right. Maybe we should take it back. Wait a minute! We can't do nothing with this money right now. Why? Because it has our fingerprints all over it. Oh, boy! I forgot all about that. What are we gonna do? Take it easy. Just take it easy. We don't have to do anything right now. And after all, we're the only people who know we have this money. We'll think of something. [HONKING] What's the matter with him? MAN: Get this over! Don't you understand English? Do you hear what I'm saying to you? I'm talking to you, mister! ROBERT: I think he wants you to pull over. JENNIFER: But we've got all this money in the car. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] What's he saying? Tell that guy to pull over! I don't think it's English. Hey! What are you, deaf? What are we supposed to do? Forget it, man, let's go! MAN: Get it over there! Get this car on the side... MAN: Don't you hear me? [MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [TIRES SCREECHING] ROBERT: I think he's some kind of maniac. JENNIFER: We've got all that money! OTIS: Don't tell him!Open that door! Police! Open the door! He say he's a cop. What do we do? Open the window. Open this window! I demand to know what this is all about. What've you got in that bag? Say, Jack, you got a warrant? Here's my warrant. Looks good to me. Now what've you got in those bags? I don't think you're a real policeman. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it? Close the window. [GROANS] [GASPS] What do we do now? Drive on![SCREAMS] [ENGINE STARTING]MAN: No! WENDELL: I don't want you driving my car. [TIRES SCREECHING] [BOTH GASP] ROBERT: Is he all right? We've injured him. He's fine. He's perfectly fine. How do we find out? Open the window. [SCREAMS][GASPS] This man is disturbed. What do we do? Close the window. You see what he's trying to do? He's trying to kill me! Man, we have got to get out of here! WENDELL: Not again! [TIRES SCREECHING] WENDELL: Stop! We're going to kill him! Talk to him. Hi, there. We're obviously having a misunderstanding of some kind. But if we just talk... Is he listening? That depends on if he's breathing. Oh, no. Can't just leave him there. It's bound to affect your mileage. Open the window. We have to see if he's still... Still... [THUDS] He looks dead. Check his pulse. No. I think his heart's still beating. What do you think he wanted with us? How in the hell am I supposed to know? Maybe he saw us pick up that money yesterday. That's it! He was there when the money fell out. He probably followed us home. Bet he figured he could cut himself in. I think he figured right. Shouldn't we take him to a hospital? Not till we negotiate as soon as he comes to. We'd better find out who he is. He must have a wallet. JENNIFER: Oh, this is wrong. All wrong. Right. He is a cop. JENNIFER: We shouldn't have just left him there. OTIS: We couldn't very well take him home and nurse him back to health! WENDELL: Just remember. We never saw a badge. Never. Never! JENNIFER: He didn't show us one! OTIS: How were we to know he was a policeman? WENDELL: He sure didn't act like a policeman. JENNIFER: Are you sure he wasn't dead? WENDELL: Well, look, I'm no doctor. ROBERT: Have you ever seen a dead man before? WENDELL: No, but... ALL: We better go back! [TIRES SCREECHING] JENNIFER: What do we do if we he's dead? OTIS: You gotta shove him in the trunk of his car. JENNIFER: Oh, no! WENDELL: Come on, this is serious. ROBERT: I'll say it is. OTIS: He's gone! So is his car! OTIS: Maybe someone stole both of them. Drove here himself? That's right, Captain Ross. Pulled into the emergency entrance, dragged himself through the door, and collapsed on the floor. Looks like someone tried to strangle him and tear the soles off his shoes. Well, when will he be able to talk? When he wakes up, I suppose. OTIS: Why did I ever pick up that bag? JENNIFER: Why did I ever open that window? WENDELL: Why did I ever get into a carpool? [SIGHS] ROBERT: Why did you? He needs the money. Hardly. I happen to be a very successful businessman. Well, it will appear very unusual unless I show up at the office on schedule. So, uh, everybody out. Hey, hold on, hold on. Wait a second, man. We have to make a plan. [SIGHS] We just go on with our day like nothing happened. Well, under the circumstances, we have to come up with a better plan that that. So as you successful businessmen will say, "Let's have lunch." Lunch? Well, that sounds a good idea. We'll all have lunch. Uh, let's all meet back here at noon. Okay? Now, now, everybody out. Noon. Please! I'm late. I bet he goes right to the police and turns us in. Maybe we should do the same thing. I don't think we should do anything but meet back here at noon. And then, if he doesn't... Are you gonna be here at noon? I don't know. Oh, I don't like this. Are you gonna be here at noon?Yeah, I'll be here. Are you sure?I'm sure. Are you gonna be here?I'll be here at noon. I was kind of expecting that you'd be here. Now I'm certain. I knew I'd be here at noon. Both of you and I'll be here. It was never a question for me. I think if you reconsider the facts, Mr. Carlowe you'll see that that's not true. It's... It's oil that's in the dumper, not natural gas. That's right. You see, the government...[PHONE DISCONNECTS] Well, at least you're consistent, Brooks. All your customers hang up on you. You better think about getting into another line of work. [WHISPERS] Ryan. Ryan. Can you remember anything? [GROANS] WOMAN: Dr. Gardener? Dr. Gardener? Hey, doc, what's the problem with him, huh? If you're referring to his voice, it's only temporary trauma to the larynx. His memory loss is something else. It's probably caused by the traumatic nature of the assault. Amnesia of this kind can last a few hours, a few days. Who knows? You Reed? Yeah. Oh. Captain Ross.Yeah. What can you tell me about this? Just that he came out of the station last night. He asked around about the armored car thing. And then he took off. You think this has something to do with the armored car robbery? It did happen in our division and Ryan is on that detail. ROBERT: So, I see some guys in the parking lot, with some lights, and camera, and a couple of pitchers of orange juice I just lost my job as a gas meter reader. So I go on over, you know, and hang around for a while. Anyway, pretty soon they motion me over. And they put the lights on me and point the camera at me and they give me two glasses of orange juice to taste. One's good, the other isn't. And the guy asks me, "Which one do you like best?" Now, if these guys were making the good stuff, they wouldn't have to go to all these troubles. So I hold up the one that gagged me and I said, "Well, I like this one better." Now, it seems they were testing this rotten stuff in Cleveland. I'm the only guy anywhere who said it was any good. One week later, I am on television. Everybody in my rooming house, everybody on my block, everybody in the town knows me. I'm a hit! And also with the start like that and a half-sister living here... There's something wrong with that policeman. He had no reason to treat us that way. We hadn't done anything wrong. We were just four ordinary people. With nearly a million dollars that had just been taken in an armed robbery. But if he was aware of that, he would've arrested us yesterday. So, you see. He couldn't have known. He shouldn't have known. Maybe he did. Whoever it was, they were taking a real chance. Yeah. These irons aren't just for show. We know how to use them. They must've come up through a manhole. Somehow they knew just which bag to grab. Captain. Whoever pulled this one off were real pros. [GROANS][PANTS] Hey, come on. Don't just stand there, man! Come on! You're supposed to move around a little! Oh, man. Now, what's the matter, eh? You got the blues? Tigo, tell me about Mexico. Ain't got no money, man. Stay here. What if I got some money? Lots of money. MAN: How come so many $100 bills? WOMAN: Well, that always helps. See Friday is payday for most of our customers. Then we took it in all weekend, and pickup isn't until Monday. There's always that much cash? Oh! That was the most ever. See, we had a special sale. All big ticket items. Color TVs, refrigerators, stuff like that. Well, who could've know how much there was? Oh, well, that will have to be someone pretty smart. You know, somebody who knew what they were doing. Excuse me. WOMAN ON TV: Then, somehow, he drove himself to the emergency ward at doctors' hospital, suffering from what are described as moderate throat injuries. The officer has been identified as detective Sean Ryan of the southwest division. Meanwhile, the manhunt intensifies. In a moment, sports. At least he's not dead. [WHISPERS] Oh. that's good. But he can identify us.That's bad. [WHISPERING] I'm taking mine back. BROOKS: You can't! If you're caught, they'll nail all of us. What about you? What do you say? I don't know.You never know. Can't you ever be decisive? Well, uh, maybe... That's a positive statement if I've ever heard one brother. Once in a while you have to stand up and be counted. You're right. Here's what I'll tell what I think we should do. Sit down! I can't see the TV!Awfully sorry! Let's say we take a vote. Majority rules. All in favor of taking the money back. How come minority never rules? Ryan. Ryan, listen to me. This is your wife here, Ryan! Don't you recognize her? [GROANS] [WAILING] Oh, no! How long have you known Ryan?Forever. [RYAN GROANING] Is he all there? He's not exactly the world's brightest guy in the world. How did he make detective? It happened 20 years ago, his wife's uncle was the precinct captain. Remember Mickey Doyle? No. Man doesn't mean anything to me. Mickey retired to Hawaii a while back.Yeah? And there was a cop you didn't wanna fool around with. They called him the avenger. [SOBBING] Uncle Mickey... PEGGY: This is so bad, I don't know what to do. You just hold tight, Peggy. I'll be on the next plane. You will, Uncle Mickey? And when I get there, I'll take care of everything. Oh, thank you! Thank you, Uncle Mickey. Bye-bye, honey. Good-bye. Hey, Ma?Yeah? That was Peggy on the telephone, Ma. What's the matter?Ah, somebody beat up Sean. He's laying in the hospital. How terrible. Did they get the ones who done it? Not yet, Ma. But if they don't... I will. OTIS: Now, now, listen. This is gonna be real easy, okay? All you have to do is walk in there, set it down in an inconspicuous place and walk out. I don't know.Walk in there nonchalantly, okay? I don't know.It was your idea. I know!Well then, get on with it! Okay... [MUTTERING]Get on with it. Nonchalantly walk in there.It wasn't my idea. Hey... Oh, hey, baby. [GASPS] Hi. I'm Sergeant Thompson. You can call me Bill. And what's your name?[CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] Well, my name... Still nothing yet. Do we need a play-by-play? Here she comes!I can't look. Tell him we don't know her. We just gave a ride down here, okay? All right. Hold it. Didn't you forget something? I'll see you tonight, huh, Raquel? This is pretty heavy. What you got in here, a million bucks? Almost. [OTIS CHUCKLING] [ALL LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] Hey! Downtown L.A., and step on it. OTIS: The way I see it. This guy Ryan is gonna remember us. He's gonna remember your hair, so change it. And he's gonna remember that moustache, so shave it! And he's definitely gonna remember those glasses. So, get new ones. What about you? Nothing to worry about, my dear. You see, to guys like him guys like me all look alike. We got to get different clothes 'cause cops remember clothes. What do we use for money?None of this. Who amongst us has all his credit cards with him? Ah, yes. Okay. One for you. And... One for me. Oh, yeah. We're gonna have to hide your car. My car? Why? You see, it's not your average compact. Give me the keys, brother. Look, I done just like I was supposed to. The second we hit that pothole I dropped the bag. I don't like this, one little bit grilled all morning by the cops and after that by them guys from the insurance company. I ain't taking the fall for this screw-up. Okay. Edna!Yes? Bad news.What? You know that deal I was talking about? Yeah.Looks like it might fall through. So, maybe I ain't gonna have the money for you to open that high-fashion boutique. [SCOFFS] Psst! Is that you? Is that you?Is that you? I think so. Where's your friend?[HORN HONKS] [HONK] What do you think, man? Do you like it? [TAPS ON CAR] Huh? I mean, this is sharp. It's got air conditioning in it man. It's got a television. Where did you get this?Uh, you know. Friend in the business. I traded it for yours. You what? You traded...That's right. Are you crazy? My wife will kill me. Get my car back!Come on man, lighten up! Calm down. It's just one little while till things cool down. All right, okay? All right. All right, well, let's go. Let's not just stand around here. What's this? It would look funny, otherwise, wouldn't it? [ENGINE SPUTTERS] [ENGINE SPUTTERS] Sean. Sean, this is your Uncle Mickey. Can you hear me? [MEEKLY] What, Uncle Mickey?Yeah. Are you alone? Yeah. [NORMAL VOICE] That's good. What happened? Somehow, it didn't quite go off like you planned. Where's the money? Somebody else got it. They knocked me off my motorbike. I did the Molotov cocktail bit. I tried to salvage something. Do you know who they were? I sure do. They tried killing me again this morning. Do you know where do they live? Pomona. I got it from the license. Oh. Then maybe it's not as bad as it seems. JENNIFER: Well, I guess we'll just have to try giving the money back again. OTIS: Once is enough. Afraid we're stuck with it. [ANNOUNCEMENT ON TV]Hey, we're missing the news. So Detective Ryan is still unable to tell you anything? Uh, that's correct, but based on our ongoing investigation, I've decided to turn the case over to the mayor's task force for organized crime. ALL: Organized crime? Organized crime? Uh, yes. This has their mark all over it. Gentlemen, I think you can see that we have a problem. Insult added to our injuries. Isn't bad enough that we own the armored truck company and the insurance carrier but we're being blamed for this. Can we trust the police to expedite this matter? Have we ever? I move that we investigate and take appropriate corrective action. Second it, gentlemen. OTIS: Look, I know what I say. But messing with organized crime is lot worse than messing with the police. I don't think it's gonna work. Hey, man it will only take 10 seconds. We walk up to the desk, We say, these are for Detective Ryan, right? We put them down, then we walk out. It's all simple. It's all we could do. [INDISTINCT] I knew it! Get out of the way, will you? Get out of the way! Would you get out of the way? [RYAN MOANING]MICKEY: Easy, easy, easy! Wait! Come on, will you? Cut it out, will you? REPORTER: What about this link with organized crime? REPORTER 2: Any comment? MICKEY: Get out of here! BROOKS: Here's your stop, Otis. OTIS: Right. I think I'll get out here, too. Well, I guess this is good-bye. [CRYING] What's wrong?Everything. [SOBBING] I just know bad things are going to happen to us if we don't give back that money. Oh, please, not again. Come on. Can't we just think about it tonight? Sure, we can. We... We can meet in the morning and if anybody has any ideas... JENNIFER: Yeah, don't you think so? Well? All right. Tomorrow at the usual time. Oh!But it's the last time. I'll just get out here. [SLOWLY] Think it's only a short walk. Good night. [SNIFFING] Hey, I'll see y'all later, all right?Yeah. How far do you have to walk? I don't know. Where do you live? I don't live anywhere, not anymore. I moved out. Well, it's dinner time. Do you have any...No. None whatsoever. Well, I've got some Brussels sprouts, some brown rice and some yogurt. Sounds great. I can pick an appropriate wine. Do you think what Mr. Brooks said about the money was right? Do you think we're stuck with it? It seems that way to me. Anita. What? Will it be all right if I came over and visited you? Wendell, you visited me last week. Can we talk? About what? Going away. You mean like Palm Springs? No, no, no. I mean far away. Tonight. What? I just want to start all over again. You and me. Oh, Wendell! Anita, I know you've lost your respect for me but I can get it back. I know I can. I care so much for you. I know how to make you happy. You know that. You know that, don't you? Anita. Anita. [ANITA SNORING] Sweet pea? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello. MAN: I know you've got the money. Hold on. Hold on for a second. [WHISPERING] Who is this? You're gonna bring it to the La Belle Cafe nine o'clock sharp tomorrow morning. If you're not there, you're dead. La Belle, la Belle, la Belle... I got it. Where... Where is it? Rosemead off-ramp, corner of Dunne and 184th. You can't miss it. I won't. I won't. I won't. Dunne and 184th. How will I recognize you? I'll be the guy with the gun. Oh, my God. It's fun pretending, isn't it? Pretending? I'm real, you're real. Brussell sprouts are real. We're just two beautiful people having a beautiful dinner together, enjoying some fantastic wine. And then we look into each other's eyes and then we make love. We do? Sure. Don't we? Well, I've really never had any experience with men. None?How did you know that? You just told me. That I used to be a nun. Oh. I thought you said you had none. That, too. Oh, I'm awfully sorry I just came on to you like that. It was very complimentary. You're not offended? No. I... I think you're nice. [GUNSHOTS FROM TV] [SCREAMING] But look, Mickey! All that organized crime stuff on television, that worries me. Them guys ain't the guys you want to mess around with. Look what they did to Sean. You know as well as I do, that's why I quit the force! I'd rather be poor than dead! Yeah. Yeah. Them guys, them guys know everything, everything. MICKEY: Not to worry, Fred. Not to worry. We'll split it tomorrow. You get the number he dialed?No problem. These are the hands of a master. You know, I should've been here to help Sean. I suppose this means we're not getting married again? Oh, no, Ruthy. Nothing like that. You've been saying you're gonna marry me ever since I was a radio dispatcher girl and you were on Car 62 and that's been 37 years! I said someday, sweetie pie, and that someday is tomorrow. You can hire the hall, dumpling. Yay! [LAUGHING] Okay, now. You're not gonna have to hurt anybody, are you? No, I don't think so. You see, we've got a big advantage here, Ruthy. We know about them, but nobody knows nothing about us. Former police captain Michael Doyle... Who liked to be called "The Avenger," planned the whole thing. His longtime friend, Miss Grogan, saw to it all the big bills were in the one bag so that Mr. Feeney could easily drop it out of the truck in order for Mr. Ryan to pick it up and still have time to get ahead of the truck and somehow cause the fire. Were there others? If there were, we'll soon know. And the missing funds?We'll recover them. Penalty? The maximum. Gentlemen? [SIGHS] Bert, what is the matter with you? I'm upset! The robbery, the business deal. I don't know! Honey, why don't you have a great big glass of prune juice and then go to bed. [DOOR BELL RINGS] Who's that?How should I know? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING CONTINUES] [GASPS]What's the matter? Bert! What are you doing? Bert! Is there something I should know? Be grateful that you don't know, Edna! That way they won't kill you. Bert, are you crazy? Bert, you're gonna catch cold! Bert, you come back up here, you hear me? You're gonna upset your stomach! [GRUNTS] Bert! Bert, you come back up here, you hear me? You'll be in bed for a week! I'm not gonna take care of you! Bert! Bert! Bert! Pomona? Where they go, we go. I thought we're gonna meet them at the La Belle Cafe? We're just making sure they go to La Belle Cafe. [ALARM RINGS] Hi. Hi. Did you get any sleep? What does it feel like waking up next to a man? It was nice. Um... If you want to shower or... You think we could both fit in there? A little morning joke. Oh!To start the day off. Um, well, I'll make some coffee. And you shower. Yeah. Let's go. [POLICE BLOWING WHISTLE] MAN 1: This is gonna hold us up.MAN 2: Yeah, I know. [SIGHS] They're turning right. I see it. We'd better not have lost them. Don't worry. We'll see them in a second. We lost them. Go. Good-bye, Anita. A cowboy! You didn't tell me he was a cowboy. I don't know who that guy is. I never saw him before in my life! [ENGINE STARTING] Is that the same car? Nothing like it. Nothing like it? [ENGINE SPUTTERS] Wait, wait! What's he doing now? I think he's putting something in the mailbox. Whoever he is Uncle Mickey he's got something to do with it. Follow him! Follow him! [CHILDREN PLAYING] I've made my decision. I'm not keeping this money, no matter what. Me, too. I think everything's going to be all right. Me, too. Hey! Hey! What are you doing in there? What are you... Otis?Yep. What did you do to your hair?I cut it. Where are you going with those tools?Away, brother. Hey, you can't do that, Otis! You can't do that! You're letting me down! I'm not gonna get you in the union! That's cool with me, bro. I don't care if you are wearing that suit, you're not gonna get in the union. Never! Hey, Uncle Mickey. Look. He's picking up some people. Who are they? I don't know. They got to be in on it. MICKEY: Let's go! Let's go! Hold it here. Don't get too close. Well, who's he? I don't know. It's them. I get it now. They must have been wearing disguises when they stole our money. Ah, tricky. And that... That girl. [CHOKING] Well? I don't want the money. You know, I could take a three-way split. I don't want my share, either. Woo-hoo! Talk about get rich quick. Hello! There isn't gonna be any rich. What? Got a phone call last night from some guy who knows we have the money. Was it the cops? No, sounded like a real hoodlum. Supposed to meet him at a cafe off the freeway. He said he'll have a gun. So, now what do we do? We give him all the money. There's something else I think I have to tell you. We don't have all the money, anymore. That's all right, I mean, I'm the only one that they know about, so... I'm the only one that has to go. Sounds good to me, brother. Hey! Hold on. Wait a minute! Get back in here. Listen. We've been together on this thing from the start. Now, we can't let him face that kind of trouble alone. We sure can't. I know I'm gonna regret this. Okay. We all go. I said let's go! There he is. I got him. Here. Read this. And if it's okay, sign it. Just so, she spelled, "Immunity" right. You know where we can find Mickey Doyle? Look, I turned him in. I ain't picking him up for you.

The turkey croquettes are superb. Cup of coffee. They just sat down. I can see that. Why won't they come over here and arrest us? What are they waiting for? He doesn't recognize us. He recognizes us. Must be the one I talked to on the phone last night. I thought it was a hoodlum! Who are the others?Just customers. Didn't we just get an APB on this vehicle? Well, I think I'm gonna go for those croquettes. Uh, would you like to join us? I believe you have something that doesn't belong to you. Right you are, officer. Hey, now what are we gonna do, Uncle Mickey? Easy, Sean. Not to worry. Them four have just as much to lose as we do. The turkey croquettes are superb. No, thank you. What's going on here? I don't know. Don't policemen talk to each other? Not when one of then is in with the mob. That explains everything. Except how do we get out of here? Can't those real policemen help us? They can also arrest us. Arrested is better than dead. Maybe if we gave those guys back this money. That'll be the end of it!Or the end of us. What have we got to lose with the police? Look, if we can't explain our connection with those guys and these bags and what's in them and why we've been carrying them along so long... Let's say about five years! Yeah, It's still better than dead. Hold it! Shh. Just relax, be cool. OTIS: That's right, man. Just be real cool. I confess, officer! Please, no handcuffs, okay? [CHUCKLES] We have a small emergency here. Please get up and leave as quickly as possible. Excuse me...Now! Oh, right! I always do as I'm told. Let's go! What's he looking at? Only one way to find out. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] POLICE: Stop right there! [ARGUING INDISTINCTLY] All right. All right. Don't get excited, now. Don't get excited. After all, robbery... All right, fine. You see, I can explain those. POLICE: Put your hands on the counter! Shut up! Shut up! Where'd they get the money? From my mailbox.Hey, I think we better get out of here! [CAR BONNET OPENING] What are they doing?Looking for us. Let's get out of here! Hold it, folks. Everything's under control inside. You can come back and have your meal. Uh, actually I am on a very strict diet. We're late for an appointment. Sorry about the inconvenience. Whoa! Walk slow. Just be calm. [ALL HUMMING] MAN: They only have part of the merchandise with them. The other parties we're looking for must have the rest. We'll locate, collect and terminate. Did you hear everything he said? I heard, "terminate" which is more than enough! Let's get out of here! I don't know about the rest of you. But I'm heading right for LAX and getting on a plane.What about the money? You better keep it 'cause ones those guys start looking for you you better go far and fast. Those people are totally unreasonable. [CAR HONKING] I'm afraid they're right. We really have no choice. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [DOOR OPENS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Stop! Get out of here. All right! Let's just... May I have your attention, please? Let's just all take it easy. Just a second. May I have your attention, please? Quiet over here. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, the task force for the organized crime from the mayor's office will be releasing a statement, a formal statement within the hour. But, I can tell you now that we are fairly certain that we have arrested all of the conspirators in the armored truck robbery. And I might add in less than 48 hours. What about the money? The money? Uh, well, we have some of it in our possession now but we have every right to believe that we will recover the rest shortly. What, uh... What organized crime figures were involved? [CLEARS THROAT] We have, in our custody, one police officer, one retired police officer and two others formerly associated with the police department. Uh, there doesn't seem to be... Any, uh... Organized crime connection here, now. That will be it now. Thank you very much. Gentlemen. This will be a public relations triumph for us and, not incidentally, a disaster for the authorities. The missing funds we continue to look for. I think we should consider it promotional expenses. I move we suspend that operation. Seconded.Gentlemen? What do you mean? You're going to Brazil? I'm going to Brazil.Hey, man it's a big country. Not big enough. Hey, listen I just want to go to a place where a guy like me with a little capital can get ahead. Try Mississippi. Rio de Janeiro, one way, please Ma'am. Don't give this man a ticket. Hey, don't listen to this man. What have you got leaving soon? What destination? Anywhere. We've got a connecting flight to Alaska in 20 minutes. That will be fine.One seat? Make it two. This is gonna be the beginning of a beautiful partnership. I don't need you. I can find a smart Brazilian to be my partner. You speak Portuguese, brother? Hmm? There are a lot of very rich high-class Americans down there too. Right! That's what I'm saying, man. So, I build 'em and you sell 'em! I tell you, Otis, it won't work. It will work. Trust me. [LAUGHING] It might work. Aren't there avalanches in Alaska? Yes. And polar bears?Yes. But don't worry I'll be there to take care of you. As long as you're there to take care of me. I think I'd like that. Me, too.
