( music playing ) Elliott Saiontz: This is the story of Srulek Feldman, my great-grandfather. He was put in the Nazi death camps during World War II. This is a close-up of his number from Auschwitz. "A17606." That was his number, and he told us, "Back then, your number was your name." That was all he was to them. ( music playing ) Hi, I'm Elliott. I'm ten years old. This is a picture of my family. I have my dad, my mom, and there's my brother, Jared. This is my great-grandfather. He is a Holocaust survivor. Elliott: Hey, Poppy! Elliott: We see him every summer, and whenever we come visit, we play games... hang out... read our books together. And this is one of his hats. He loves wearing hats. Every time I go to the store, I buy a hat. I buy another hat. I keep buying. I say, "Well, how many hats you need?" I say, "Well, I like those hats." Elliott: As far as I can remember, I've been asking him questions. He's good at storytelling. We talk about all kinds of things. My favorite topic to usually talk to him about would be what he did before the war. Who's that? That's my daddy. - That's your dad? - Yeah, my daddy, and that's my aunt. - That's Sammy. - That's Sammy, and then-- - That's me. - So that must be you and Sally? That's my wife Sally. I had a big family. Can you tell me a story about where you're from? - Where I was born? - Yeah, where you were born. - I was born in Poland. - Where in Poland? Srulek: Where? The name of the town: Sosnowiec. - Elliott: Was it pretty or what? - Oh, yeah. Nice place. ( birds chirping ) Srulek: We live good there. - Elliott: Did you go to school? - Sure, I went to school. ( children chattering ) What'd you do for fun? I went to watch the soccer game. Very happy life. We have a good family. We were very close. In summertime, we went for vacation. It was a good life. What did your father do as his job? He was a cap maker. He made hats. That was his business. He was very successful. And Saturday, everybody went to temple. My father dressed up, elegant, with a nice hat. He was a smart man. He was young, but he was smart. Did you ever learn how to drive a car? Drive a car? ( laughs ) We have a horse, not a car. - We have no cars. - ( both laughing ) Elliott: Great-Poppy told me there's always trouble for Jews, but your religion didn't really matter back then... till the Nazis came. Eventually there was a lot of problems going on, and Adolf Hitler made a big speech and said, "All of the Jews are causing all the problems. If we kill all the Jews, then we're gonna have no more problems." Srulek: They said, "Well, Hitler's coming to you." They was very nasty. ( crowd shouting ) Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Elliott: Most of the Jews were scared. They didn't want to get hurt. Do you remember seeing any of this? Like, seeing the burning temple? Mm-hmm. Do you remember what this was? Jews were forced to wear a yellow star. You have to wear this. You put it on right over here. I used to wear that. Elliott: Why? When you walk on the street, they know you are Jewish. Did you have to do that to your store? - Yeah. - Write on all the windows, "Jews"? Srulek: Jude. That's a Jew. Elliott: There were people chucking rocks at Jewish people's stores, only because they were Jewish. My great-grandfather, it was really hard for him. He got kicked out of school because he was Jewish. Srulek: The Germans came in, and they rounded us up. And they sent us to the ghetto. We left everything home. You couldn't take nothing with you. Elliott: The ghetto was a little area where they crammed a huge bunch of Jews in there, forced them to live in there. Srulek: We had maybe... 15 or 20 people sleeping in one room. I slept on the floor. Elliott: They lost their homes, they lost their possessions, they lost their money, they lost their businesses, they lost everything. What happened after you were in the ghetto? I was walking with my friends on the street. I was young-- 14. Then the Germans with a car pull up, and they grabbed me, and they took me away. - Did they grab any of your friends? - Yeah. - All of them? - All of them. And they put me in a room. My mother and father-- I looked at the window, I only see my father. My mother, she didn't come because she was heartbroken. My father came in, he say like that, "Good-bye." He told me, "You're young. You go to work. We don't know what will happen to us over here." And he was right. You know what happened to your father? What happened? No. I never saw him. I never knew it what happened. I never knew what happened to my mother and my father. I never saw them again. Elliott: The Nazis wanted to take over all of Europe. ( gunfire, explosions ) And so they invaded one country after another. They planned to kill every single Jewish person in Europe. Did it scare you? Scare me? Sure, they scared me. I always hope I go see my parents again. ( baby crying ) I always think about them. Elliott: When the Nazis captured you from the ghetto, what'd they do? Srulek: They transfer me. They put me on the train. - Elliott: To where? - To the camp. ( hinges creak ) Srulek: They sent me from one camp to the other one. When I was in Fallsbruck labor camp, my father sent me this hat. My father did a lot of business with the German people, and they brought this in for me. I knew it-- why he sent me the-- the hat. Right here he put the money in, you see? Right here was open. When I got it, I open up and I found the money right there. But I couldn't do nothing with the money. You couldn't buy nothing in the camp. So I took the money out and I give it to the head man from the camp, then he give me some food and he treat me better. Great-Poppy says the extra food and stuff that he got from the money is how he survived. Srulek: Finally, they send me to Auschwitz. ( chatter ) Elliott: Auschwitz was a death camp or concentration camp. Concentration camp was a place where they kept them behind a bunch of electric fences so they wouldn't escape. And they had guards around the electric fence, with guns, to shoot them if they tried to escape. When I arrive in the camp, they put this number. Srulek: They didn't call me Jack. They didn't call me my name; they called a number. So they weren't who they really were. They were just numbers. When he was at the death camps, they were like slaves. They didn't care for them. The Nazis made them dig holes just to make them work. If they did one little mistake and they got caught, they'd just, like, shoot them, kill them. We dig the ground, you know? We don't know for what. Srulek: No peace. You want to lay down and sleep, they call you. There's no peace. What did you eat there? Srulek: Soup, water. On Sunday, they give you a piece of bread. Were you, like, skinny? Kind of like this? Skinny, my feet were skinny, my whole body was skinny. How did you get out of Auschwitz? Srulek: The Germans started to lose the war, and they wanted to run away. They took us, and we march. For six months, walking, walking, every night, every day and night. Without food. Without shoes. A lot of people couldn't make it. Elliott: Thousands and thousands of people just died. If you stopped or, like, went off course-- shot you, dug up a hole, threw you in the hole. Srulek: We walk until May. May 5, I was liberated by the Russians. When the Russians left, the Americans came in. Elliott: After the war, he went back to his hometown. No one was there. Did you find anyone? In my hometown, I didn't find nobody. That's why I left. Elliott: He went to Germany, to live there, in a displaced persons camp, and he got married. - ( foghorn blows ) - And then he went on a boat. When he got to America, the funny thing is, he thought his name wasn't fancy enough, so he changed his name to Jack. And then opened up Jack's Fish Market. Elliott: Hi, Poppy. - You see the fish? - Yeah. Srulek: That's Poppy's store. What time is it? It's time for lunch. - Elliott: I like the grouper. - Srulek: You like grouper? And you, what you like? Salmon. Salmon! Let me find out if they have salmon. Man: This is the only place that we know that you can get something to eat if you ain't got no money. This is his number right here. And he knows exactly what it means to be hungry. So therefore, if anybody's hungry, he will feed them, if you got money or not. ( chattering ) Elliott: His stories have, like, changed a lot of people-- the way they think, the way they act. You need to know it to understand, to stop it from happening in future generations. Elliott: They say in, like, a year or two there's gonna be, like, no survivors left, and so we're trying to get all their stories, all the information, before they pass away. He's a hero to most people... for how he survived and stuff. I know he's my family's hero. ( music playing ) Srulek: I had nice day today. I enjoy very much with you, to be with you. When you coming to see me again? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yeah. - Oh, okay.
