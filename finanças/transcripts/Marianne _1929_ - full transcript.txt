So she cooked you a pig! Well, boy...you gettin' along all right! Oh, give us an invitation to your dinner! No I'm gonna ask my dinner out to you. Here, take this, Sammy... Oh, wait a minute...I'll eat it, but I wouldn't handle it! Let me handle it... In the barn...I'll be there in a minute. Hey! Save me a wing!

Quick...the lieutenant he wait... you get me my pig...quick... Let 'im wait! Oh, but you do not understand, m'sieur... He has paid me money for this pig. He paid you money?! Oh, oui, monsieur... It is the most money we have in the world. I buy shoes for François... dress for Nanette... pants for Jacques... and a pottie for Sylvestre. Oh, gee babe, I didn't know he'd paid you money. Why, I'll get it back for you, tout de suite! Now you just wait here a minute. Oh, Mon Dieu! Jusqu'au je veux sel! Why all this delay? Oh, m'sieur le général... So sorry I am!

Disappear?...Has the girl gone mad? Lieutenant...was this young woman in actual possession of a pig? Oui, m'sieur...he live here with me. Why, I knew the pig as a suckling, sir. I'm not asking for your reminiscences, lieutenant... I'm merely trying to find out if we had a pig here for dinner. Oh, yes, sir...why I smelled him just before you came in sir. I beg your pardon. Pardon me, General. Certainly. Now see here, young lady... just what became of that pig? Well, it was like this, you see... Just where did you last see him? Well... He was sitting on his plate. Sitting on his plate? A fine place for a pig to sit! And where is the pig now? Oh, m'sieur...he was so fright that are not to be served... such a great general. That...he run away. And where did he run to? Maybe he run to American boys. Oh...so the battalion quartered here is responsible for the disappearance of the general's dinner, eh? Oh, no, m'sieur! It is what you call a...one-man job! Who is that one man? Oh, no man, m'sieur... no man at all. Indeed! Then whom do you suspect? How I know? You must have some idea. Near here...very old farm... Full of the thing which return... The thing in the long white shirt... The big ghost! Oh, so it was the ghost who ate the pig, eh? Exactement! Now is all clear! Just as clear as mud! I'm sorry, we must be going, lieutenant. But, General...I... You invite me to dinner, and all I get is the "Tale of a Pig", eh? Please sir, let me apologize. It's alright, lieutenant... We'll probably get something at headquarters. And then we have no ghost who is fond of roast pig. Oh, but let me assure you sir... Very, very funny! Oh, je suis minable. Oh, je suis minable! Marianne! I got there too late! I had to battle those guys even to get this much back. Oh, I'm sorry! Oh you... This is all a little game for you. Why you laugh at me, practically eh? Why you give them my pig, eh? Now in all this trouble you got me! Oh, gee...we didn't know it was the general's dinner! Gee, I wouldn't have done that to you! Oh..."Gee! Gee! Gee! Gee!"... I 'ate you! Go away! Arrest this time...I get you shot! Oh, listen...! Well...so help me, Pershing! So it was you, you New Jersey hick! Go a little easy with that stuff... The war's over! Yeah...well with you it's just beginning! No, no, no...please! Do not make the fight! This one have not steal the pig. - He didn't, eh? - No... Because if he steal the pig, he would eat everything. He bring something back! Oh, so that's it... You're both framing me. I suppose the money I gave to you, you gave to him. One day, lieutenant...when you and me are back in civvies... I'm gonna meet you, and when I do... I won't forget that crack. Is that so?! Well, just now, you're wearing a uniform. What to do...eh? I guess it's alright... I probably deserve it. Arrest that man...throw him in the guardhouse. I'll be over and prepare... On your way, buddy! Do not take him! Wait a minute! What they do to him...? I hope they hang him. Hang him?! You are mad with him...eh? Because you think he have liked me, eh? And because you know I have liked him, eh? Well, that's why you want to get him shoot, eh? What he have do to you, eh? He have steal the pig which you have pay for the dinner, eh? Well, now...I give you back your money, eh? And the dinner... she's not yours, eh? You have no more to fight about the dinner, eh? So, here is your 200 francs. Now, what your kick is...eh? My kick is that I was ever foolish enough to have anything to do with you. Which is the same from me to you!

Henri Dubois François Georges Joseph Anatole Dubonnet... That's enough! Sounds like a cocktail. I don't know who he is. What shall I tell him, sir? What's he want? If I could understand him sir, I wouldn't have bothered you sir. Alright, send him in! Lieutenant Dubonnet! What's your business? This is for the general. I am one of his most dear friends. Oh, you are? Well that's startling news. I didn't know he had any. Oh, oui...he have like me very much. And I 'ave like 'im very much. We are what you call... "most intimate." I'm beginning to understand. So you and the general are great friends, eh? Oui. You didn't meet him at the front? No m'sieur, I have meet him at the back. I have meet him here in the village. The sly old fox. Now you will let me see the general, eh? You're a cute little devil, whoever you are. I don't suppose you'd even look at a mere major. I am look at you now.

So they 'ave ask me to go to the general... and see if 'e can 'elp you make the getout. Oh, so that's how it was, eh? You went to the bat for me for what my friends said, eh? Sure.

Bonjour! Hey!... Say, Lieutenant... Next time ya see that girl, will ya tell her I love her? Love her better than anything on earth. She will not want to hear it... After all these problem which you 'ave caused 'er. That's the way with us men... We always hurt the people we love most. But sometimes... we try to be worth it. M'sieur...you have insulted a French officer. Well, if you still wanna be a Frog 'loot'...OK! Hey, fellas! Hello good-lookin'... what's wrong with YOU? Marianne wouldn't let him inside the house since he came back. Well I don't blame her. She don't want any jail-birds around here corruptin' her kids. Ain't it lucky you monkeys found a hand organ. Oh, we didn't find it. We were walkin' down the street over here... The man what we bought it from wasn't looking! And let me give you a tipoff, kid... It's no use for you to go in there to sing to Marianne... Because we have the exclusive rights to serenading her. Never leave your girl with an Ital...ian Go and grab yourself a tin cup, and you'll do OK. C'mon...let's make happiness. Oh, Nanette... Voolay voo... Can you tell me where Marianne is? Marianne fait la lessive dans le ruisseau. Thanks a lot. Hello! Busy, eh? Am I not always busy, m'sieur? Sure...I just said that to be talkin'. You know...I like you a lot better in your own clothes. And I like you better when you are not so close. You don't mean that, Honey! I do not, eh? You are funny one. Always making what you call the kidding. That's the very thing of it Marianne...I ain't. I was, yeah... But yesterday. somehow... With us gettin' ready to leave, and all... Gee...I've got an awful queer feelin'. Maybe you have drink too much. Now YOU're kiddin'. You're just doin' it coz you don't want to listen to me. Ain't that so? I am too busy, m'sieur... I have no time to make the kidding. You've gotta listen, do you hear! You've gotta! Coz I ain't foolin' now. I love you! I love you. You hear me? Sure I 'ave 'ear you... Am I blind? I didn't know at first... I mean I wasn't sure. Coz I never been in love before. Honest I haven't. How laugh you make me. You tell it to every girl you see. Sure I did. And knew I was lyin' when I said it to 'em. Now it's on the level...you hear me... It's on the level. I love you...and I ain't goin' away without you. No, not that... You must not do this. You will go when the soldier of your country go. And I...? I will stay here where I am alone. And when you get back to that Second Forty Street... many girl will meet you and say... "Hello Stagg!" "You 'ave nice time with French girl at the war?" Quit it, you hear! Quit it! You can't fool me! You can't fool yourself! You're in love with me. O, Marianne...what's wrong? No Stagg, please. Tell me...what's the matter? Listen, you hear that? It is like the voice of someone who tell me I am bad girl for like you. Why, what do you mean? That song...it tell me just now to tell me no. But what's the song got to do with it? This song has the same name as I have...Marianne. In the war before she start... a boy sing this song to me. And he ask me to wait until he come back. And you? I have give the promise. Wear the ring which he have give. Where is he now? They tell me he was tooken prisoner one year ago. Gee...then he'll be comin' home soon. Why didn't you tell me before? I am like you, Stagg. I think it not so seriously. And besides... I am forget! You think that's gonna make any difference? Oh, you mean that? You got an idea... Just coz some other guy's in love with you, I'm gonna quit? I been fightin' over here a year and a half... No, Stagg, please not to make the fight. Listen...I will kill him, too. My Marianne, will you remember me? All the time...while I'm...away? Oh, my Marianne, I hope you will keep for me Each caress of yesterday. Deep in my 'eart I 'old you, tenderly... I know that you...that you will be true to me, chèrie... And so when I am gone... I'll carry on... My darling Marianne... for...you. Yeah...I know that song...I'd forgotten. Wouldn't it mean the same if I sang it to you? The words could be mine, just as well as his, couldn't they? My Marianne, will you remember me? All the time while I'm away? My Marianne, I hope you'll keep for me Each caress of yesterday. Deep in my heart I hold you, tenderly... I know that you are true to me, chèrie... And so when I am gone... I'll carry on... My darling Marianne... for...you. You see...anyone can sing the song... But ANYONE can't love you like I do. You're mine... And the whole French army couldn't take you away from me! No, Stagg... Then must I take myself away from you. When one knows what is the duty... Which is the honest thing to do... Then nothing else... Oh, Marianne! No, Stagg, no...you must not see me again. Not see you again? No. Holy gee, kid! How can you ask that? Just this guy you ain't seen in 4 years! Just because he made you promise! No Stagg...Marianne have make the promise. Marianne will keep it. You will shake the 'and? If you cannot... Then that is good for me also. Though I will say... Au revoir! I wish you much happiness. Much...happiness! Marianne! You know...we're shovin' off for home tomorra... ...and these boys are givin' you all these presents to remember 'em by. But I lost all my money in a crap game. So I'm gonna give you somethin' for the future. When you get married... if you have a little boy... When he grows up, give him this address in New Chateau Believe me you should know the girl from New Chateau.. Her lips to kiss 'n' this is my ambition... She got a chicken named Marcel And this girl spends her days By gettin' up at 6 in the morning To watch how Marcel lays. Believe me you should know the girl from New Chateau.. and oh, how she cooks gefilte Fisch! Boys, I wanna tell you about this girl... While we were here, fighting for democracy... We all was making us a crisis... Didn't we all was showing the right spirit. Now, I'll tell you how she cooks gefilte Fisch! She takes the pole, on the pole is a hook... On the hook is a worm... she puts it in the water... Gets a nibble...pulls up the fish... Cleans off the scales, cleans inside... Cuts of the head, cuts off the tail... Over here is the head... over here is the tail... She puts them all together... And Oh................ Believe me you should know the girl from New Chateau... We're friends, so why should she be my wife?! Julie-Fifi met a fellow, Julie-Fifi fell in love... Julie-Fifi do much spooning While the moon shone from above.

I take 'im to the door... We stand an hour or more... And do we know what for? Oo-la-la-la-la! My spine to go like this... My 'eart to go like that... My 'ead goes spinning in a trance... I could holler "Vive la France." At 12, he joke with me... At 1, he serve me tea... And then from 2 to 3... Oo-la-la-la-la! Sing like Maurice Chevalier! I 'ave no straw 'at! Every little breeze seems to whisper "Louise." A bird in the trees seems to twitter "Louise." Each little rose Tells me I that I adore you. Every little beat that I feel in my heart, Seems to repeat, What I knew from the start, Each little sigh Tells me that I adore you, Louise. Just to see and hear you Brings joy I never knew. But to be so near you, Thrills me through and through. Everyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be, but the wonder is this: Can it be true, Someone like you could love me, Louise? We have all day to doubt... My heart it jump about... Boy, if my wife finds out... Oo-la-la-la-la! Sing a Sarah Bernhardt song! In the French way? I will try. Oo-la-la! Oh, wait a minute! Look, blondie...why don't you give a Yankee a break. I will sing it like the American doughboy. When I see my sugar... I get a lump in my throat Marianne, please... I can't keep quiet no longer.

That is the fella...that is the real fella of the gal that Stagg thought he was the fella of. Au revoir. Oh look, they got with him a 'pritzer'. A 'pritzer'...what makes marriaging. My guess they're going to get marriaged right away. No, no...Marianne won't get married until the battalion’s gone. Why? You see, well, Marianne don't want to make the battalion cry. Look at Stagg...there is coming out of his eyes water. Hey! If you guys don't lay off me... somebody 'll get a sock right in the puss! Now get that!
