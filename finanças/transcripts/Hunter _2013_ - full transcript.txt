(soothing instrumental music) (traffic hums) - Amy will call at around 10. For breakfast. But I'm hungover and my body wakes me up at eight. I spend three dollars on coffee. 13 on cigarettes. (jagged electronic music) I smoke. I wait. It's eleven o'clock and I'm tired again. The phone rings. (baby crying) And I answer. It's so fucking hot in this room. - Grace is calling. - No, don't, don't pick up. She keeps annoying me about that stupid short story. - I thought you quit. - Last pack. - [Amy] Can I have one? - Don't you wanna go eat? - Yeah, just let me, uh, rest my feet for a second. These shoes are miserable. So what's new? - Absolutely nothing. - Nothing? - I stopped wearing underwear. - Ew. With jeans? - So? Farah's inspired me. - You think she's gonna move in with her boyfriend? - Farah? Not a chance, she's not exactly conventional. - Convential? What, you think Adam and I are conventional? - [Man] Maybe. - Shut up. - What? You moved into his apartment. You cook for him. You're conventional. - How am I any different from Farah? - You know Farah, she'll casually down a bottle of whiskey and have a threesome on a Tuesday. - Yeah, 'cause she's insane. - She's not insane. She's just anxious. Derek just sent me a picture of a poodle. Why's he still texting me? - Beause he likes you. - You think? - Yes, that's what people do when they like each other. They just, like, text photos of random shit. - [Man] Well, it's really annoying. - I think you love the attention. - [Man] No I don't. - Yeah you do. Just do me a favor and don't string him along like you always do. It's rude. (phone rings) Hold on. Hey, babe, what's up? Yeah, just having lunch with Gavin. Why? Are you serious? I literally just got off the train. 'Kay, fine. I said okay, fine. Bye. Shit. He needs me. - He needs you? Right now? You just got off the train. - What am I supposed to do? He left his keys in the apartment, I have to let him in. - What am I supposed to do, eat alone? - What's wrong with eating alone? Don't all great writers eat alone? Like Williams, Capote. - Fine, just, just go. - [Amy] Well what are you doing later? - I don't know. - 'Kay, so I'll call you. I'm sorry, love you. - Oh hey. - What? - Can you please finish the invite for my birthday? - Can you please get your own Facebook? Maybe then I'll have lunch with you. I shouldn't waste money on a cab but I just got my last paycheck and my feet hurt. And so I wait. Adam's getting coffee down the block from our apartment. I tell him I'll call when I get home. I change out of heels and into a pair of flats. He hates when I look taller than him. I take my eyeliner off because he says it makes me look like a slut. He's right. I text him to say I just got home. (clock ticking) I wait. And wait. (clock ticking) (phone chimes) And he answers. (doorbell rings) - [Gavin] Coming. (knocking) - [Voiceover] Hi, slut. - [Gavin] Oh yeah. - I forgot my keys. And I have to pick up a few things. - You leaving? - [Woman] Yeah, I'm going to Jersey with James, remember? - So you guys got back together? - Uh, yeah. He fucked me so good last night. - Really? - Listen, my mom called and said that the landlord called her. Apparently the neighbors complained. - About what? - About our buzzer always ringing. They think you're a drug dealer or something. - What? I don't complain about their fucking baby crying all night. - [Woman] Yeah, I don't, I don't know. (TV chatters) - Hey, you're gonna be back in time for my party, right? - Yeah, it's on Saturday, right? - [Gavin] Yeah. - Yeah, I'll be back Saturday morning. - Do you think the neighbors are gonna kill us? - What? Fuck them. It's your birthday. Just don't do anything before then to piss them off. Oh hey, do have the rent check? - No, my dad's bringing it tomorrow, sorry. - Can you just put it under my blow dryer? By the mirror. - Yeah, totally. - Cool. Okay. Do you like this outfit? - It's nice. - Do I look fat, be honest. - [Gavin] You don't look fat. - Be honest! - [Gavin] You don't look fat. - I hate you. - I love you. - All right, I have to run. Call me if you love me. - Bye. - [Woman] Bye bye. (gentle instrumental music) (doorbell rings) - Hey. What's goin' on? - [Amy] Adam just broke up with me. - What? Just now? - [Amy] Mm hmm. - [Gavin] Did he say why? - I mean, he said that he's gonna go stay at his brother's place, but I just. No, I don't wanna be there alone. - [Gavin] Of course. - I hate that stupid apartment. - Well, stay with me. - Can I? - Yeah, Farah just left. She, she's going to Jersey to visit her boyfriend for a couple days. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - [Gavin] Of course. - Thank you. Are you sure you don't mind? - [Gavin] No, I hate being alone. - Me, too. Can I use your stove to burn the stupid necklace that he got me? - I wish, but Farah hasn't paid the gas bill. - Fuck. Jesus Christ, it's hot in here. - Yeah, that's why she's never here. - Can I just sleep with you? - Uh, no. (pulsing instrumental music) - I wanna drink. Heavily. - Really? Well, you know, Derek just asked me if I want to go down to the Eastern Bloc. - Isn't that a gay bar? Okay, it's not exactly the rebound night I had in mind. - It's right down the block. And he usually pays for everything. Probably buy your drinks and mine. - Okay. Fine. (bright electronic music) - That guy's hogging our game. (Pac Man bloops and beeps) - I know. I, uh, I keep giving him dirty looks. - [Gavin] No, don't. - Why not? - I mean, look at him, he's all alone. - I'm going on a date tomorrow. - A date? - Yep. - Who you going on a date with? - Uh, there's this guy that keeps coming to the record shop. He's always asking me to get a drink. - You work at a record shop? - Yeah, on Sullivan. - The bathroom is disgusting. So gross. - I think you've had enough. - I'm fine. - How long were you dating this guy? - A year. - I dated somebody for five months once. - I've never dated anyone before. - You're lucky. - [Gavin] No I'm not. - Yeah you are. - At least you've experienced what it's like when someone feels that way about you. - Yeah, but it's not what you think. It's better just not have that to begin with than to have it and lose it. Trust me. - Don't you think it's worse to know that you feel that way about someone and know that they'll never feel that way about you? - No, knowing that you once did and don't anymore, that's worse. - Whatever. - I wanna go home. - Why don't you guys just stay for one more drink? - [Amy] No, I just wanna go to sleep. - [Derek] But my tab is still open. - She's staying with me. I, I should take her home. But, hey, I'm having a party on Saturday for my birthday? Coco'll be there, you should come. - I didn't know it was your birthday. - [Gavin] Yeah, Saturday at my place. - Cool. - Hey, feel better. - Thanks. - [Gavin] You okay? (rhythmic electronic music) (Pac Man bleeps and bloops) - See the way he smiled at you? - Yeah, it was totally creepy. - Oh my God. I can't help you. - What the hell are you doing? Amy, what the fuck are you doing? Get up. Amy, get up, come on. You can sit at my apartment. - I'm gonna sit here. Am I fun? - [Gavin] What? - You said I was conventional. - Amy, come on. I was kidding. You're lots of fun. Okay, how 'bout this? We go home. I have lighters and matches and we can slowly try and burn your necklace, how's that? Just get up. Come on, it'll be fun. Come on. Come on. Come on. - [Amy] All right. - Come on. Yeah, that's a girl. - [Amy] I'm so fucking excited to be. Who's that? - [Gavin] I don't know. - [Amy] You don't know? - [Gavin] I have no idea. - [Amy] You don't know who that is? - [Gavin] No, I don't know. - [Amy] Well maybe he's one of Farah's weirdo friends. - Maybe. - Why is? Why is he? You really don't know who that is? - No. Dude. - [Amy] Is he one of your secret lovers? - Dude, get up. You need to get up. - [Amy] Gavin. - [Gavin] Get up. - You, you don't, you don't know who that is? - [Gavin] No, I don't, no. - He's a stranger? - [Gavin] I don't know who it is. - It's a stranger? - [Gavin] Yes, I don't know him, therefore he is a stranger. - [Amy] Oh shit, what the fuck? Here. Who do you wanna call? Oh shit. - What are you doing? - [Amy] Oh shit, I'm calling the police! - No, no, do not. - [Amy] Wino, Gavin. - [Gavin] Do not. - [Amy] What if he's a thief? - [Gavin] Do not call the police. - [Amy] Gimme that! - [Gavin] Stop it! - [Amy] Gimme my phone! - Shh, my neighbors. - [Amy] Gimme my phone. - My neighbors hate me. No! - [Amy] I have a voicemail. - [Gavin] I don't care. - I need to check. - [Gavin] I don't care, you lost phone privileges. That's it, you lost it. - Gavin, I don't, okay, okay. I have a plan, I have a plan. I'm gonna go inside and. Give me your keys. And you can be the man of the hour. - [Gavin] Can you just, can you just let me think? - [Amy] Gavin. - Just let me think, okay? (muffled voices) (fluorescent lights hum) Okay. I need you to help me, okay? - [Amy] No. - Grab his arm. - No, I'm not gonna push him down the stairs. - [Gavin] We're not gonna push him down the stairs. We're gonna carry him inside to my apartment. (Amy laughs) - [Gavin] What? - [Amy] No! - My neighbors get up and they see some random guy passed out in front of my door, I'm screwed. - [Amy] Then why don't you just push him in front of somebody else's door and they can handle the situation? - Come on. - I don't like this, Gavin, this is weird. This is. - [Gavin] Yeah, you're right. - It's so fucking weird. - [Gavin] It's weird. It's weird. You know what else it is? - [Amy] Hmm? - Unconventional. - You're an asshole. (laughs) (Gavin laughs) It's not funny. (Gavin laughs) Don't laugh. - I mean, come on. - [Amy] Why are you dumb? - Please. Come on. - [Amy] Okay. I'm not gonna touch his skin. - [Gavin] Okay, fine. - Just grab his arms. - I'm not touching his skin! - Okay, fine, grab his feet, I'll grab his arms. - [Amy] But there's skin everywhere. - Oh my God, just grab his shoes then, I don't care. Okay, ready? On three. One. Two. - I really have to pee. - [Gavin] Three. (baby crying) (door knob rattles) (muffled voices) - The first thing I hear is people laughing. First thing I see is white. Then blue and red. (construction work hammers) - [Gavin] Hi. - Hey. Do I know you? - [Gavin] No. - No. - We found you last night. By the stairs. - We? - [Gavin] My friend Amy and I. - Yeah. (snorts) Thanks. - Mm hmm, sure. I'm Gavin. - Carter. What's with these? - They're my roommate's. I don't know. So do you know someone in the building or? - [Carter] I don't even know where the fuck I am right now, man. - 513 East 5th Street. - [Amy] Morning. - Allie. - Amy. - Don't you have to, uh, call someone? - Uh. I think I may have lost my phone. - [Gavin] Uh. Well, what's the last thing you remember? - Um, shit. I got off the plane and-- - You were on a plane? - Yeah, I'm from outside Denver. Uh. I got in to New York and I tried calling my friend but he didn't answer. He had the address I'm supposed to go to. And, and then these people that I met on the plane, they bought me a bunch of drinks in some bar. And then I just, yeah, I started walking. Could I pour myself a glass of water? - Don't ask me. - She's not a morning person. - What time is it? - [Gavin] Eight. - Oh Jesus. - Do you wanna use my computer to, to Facebook someone or something? - No, I, I don't even have Facebook. Uh, I'll figure something out, it's okay. - Hey, so, look. - [Amy] Did he leave yet? - He only has $150 to stay in New York until Sunday. - What a fucking idiot. - He's from Denver, he doesn't know. Plus he's supposed to meet up with a friend but he couldn't get ahold of him. - Facebook. - Doesn't have one. - Of course not. I know what you're thinking. You can't just let some random person stay here just because he's cute, Gavin. - So you think he's cute. - [Carter] The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. (snorts) - I just feel bad. I mean, what's he gonna do? - The exact same thing he would've done if he didn't pass out on your doorstep. You've already been nice enough. Tell him to leave. This whole thing is dangerous. - So, listen. I was talkin' with Amy and-- - You've read this? - I just started it. Why, have you read it? - Parts. My mom was obsessed with this author. She was 22 when she wrote this, Carson McCullers. 23 when she won that, um, that prize. That, like, award. - The Pulitzer? - That's the one. - So, I have this couch that no one's gonna use. It's not very comfortable but I thought you could crash on it if you wanted to save your cash for food and stuff. - Seriously? - It's only two nights. - I, I could pay you something. - No, you don't have to do that. If Amy and I were both gone, then you'd have to, uh, you know. - [Carter] Leave. - It's not that I think you'd steal or anything, it's just. - [Carter] You think that I might steal something. It's cool. - Cool. - [Carter] I mean, you're sure you don't mind because I really feel like-- - No, no, I, I like having people around. - Nice boots. - Thanks. - Better hide 'em. (jagged electronic music) How much do you pay for this place? - 1,000. - Together? - No, I pay 1,000, she pays 1,500. She got the bigger room. - [Carter] Holy shit, where do you work? - Uh, I go to school. - So how do you pay for it? - My parents. - You're lucky. So is your roommate depressed or something? - She's not my roommate. You mean Amy, she, she's just a friend. Why do you think she's depressed? - I don't know. People that sleep a lot tend to be depressed. - She just broke up with her boyfriend. - Oh. Breakups suck. Oh, sorry, you're busy. - No, I'm just makin' a stupid invite for my birthday party on Saturday. - [Carter] Your birthday's this Saturday? - [Gavin] 22. - Oh, well you've got, you've gotta win that Pulitzer next, next year then. - Yeah, right. How old are you? - [Carter] 23. - [Gavin] Could've been you. - So, why don't you just call your friends? - Can you imagine someone doing a maybe over the phone? - What's wrong with maybe? - Maybe's a terrible word, it's, it's yes, unless something better comes along. - Oh, Grace. - [Gavin] Don't pick up. - Gavin, can I talk to you for a second? - Uh, sure. So, what's wrong? - I left my last paycheck in my drawer. - At your apartment? - Yeah. I'm afraid he's gonna go through my shit and take it. - [Gavin] Okay, after my dad comes, I'll go with you. - [Amy] You don't have to go with me, I'll go alone. - No, I'm not gonna let you go there alone. Take Carter. I think he feels awkward about staying here anyway. - Is he actually staying here? - It's two nights. - I slept with a frying pan last night. - Yeah, I know, I think he's scared of you. - Good. I'm glad you think it's hilarious. - Relax, I just. - [Amy] Don't need to relax. - Look at it this way, okay? Think how it'll look if Adam is actually home and you walk in with an attractive blonde stranger behind you. Come on, don't be such a drag. He's nice. - Where are your cigarettes? Adam works on Thursdays. Last week, he saw my class schedule for the fall and mentioned something about switching shifts. I smoke. I change. I tell myself I shouldn't want him to be home. But I do. Carter comes to the door to ask if I'm ready. And I answer. So explain this to me. You lost your cellphone. Don't even know how that's humanly possible if you keep it in your pocket. You don't have a Facebook. So, like, that's it. How are you supposed to find your friend? - Well. - [Amy] Giving up? - My friend doesn't know I'm here and I don't know where he lives. - What? - Listen, it's kinda personal, okay? - Oh, sorry. - [Carter] Yeah. - Is that how you get to stay in people's apartments all the time for free? - What is your excuse? - Gavin happens to be a good friend of mine. I didn't just pass out on his doorstep. He invited me. - He invited me, too. - [Amy] Yeah, because this is Gavin, he's nice. Especially to people like you. - People like me? - [Amy] Mm hmm. - What's that supposed to mean? - [Amy] Nothing. - How far is this place anyway? - It's like two stops off the L, Brooklyn. - So, we should take a cab. - L is a train. And, uh, I'm not paying for a cab. - I'll pay. - 'Kay, not like I care at all, but, uh, if you're short on cash, you probably shouldn't waste money on a cab. - Come on, I want it, it's like a New York thing, right? Ridin' around in taxis, really New York, right? - If you're paying for it, yeah, of course it is. - [Carter] Yeah. - [Amy] What are you looking at? - [Carter] Your necklace. Who got that for you? - I got it for myself, why? Who got that for you? - My mom. - Your mom? That's cute. Didn't exactly pin you for a Mama's boy. Um, did Gavin, like, tell you anything about me when we left the house? - No, he just said we're gonna pick up some stuff at your place, why? - Um, okay, so at my place, there might be this guy there that I, like, haven't seen in a while, so. I don't know, I, um. I just need you to do me this stupid little favor and just pretend that you, just pretend that you, like-- - You want me to pretend that I like you. - [Amy] Something like that. - What do I get? - I'll stop asking so many personal questions. - I don't mind. - All right, uh. I'll buy you dinner. - Okay. (muffled electronic music) - (sighs) It's hot as hell in here. - There's AC in my room. - You still have all this garbage out here? Is this yours? - Farah has a friend staying over. - Well what kind of friend? - Just a friend. - [Older man] For how long? - Few nights. - You think that's safe? - He's her friend. - [Older man] You told me you quit. - That's all Farah. - Not dating this girl, are ya? - Farah? No. - Here. - Uh, no, I think the landlord put, put me on the lease, so it has to be made out to him. Not, not Farah. - Oh. Well what's his name? - I don't know. Uh, it might be a company or something. I can ask her later. - Well can you call her now? - [Gavin] Her phone's been off all day. I tried earlier. She'll be home in like an hour. - Fine, okay. Fine. Here ya go. And put it somewhere safe. - Thanks. - [Older man] Come on, put it, put it in your wallet. - I don't have a wallet. - Why don't you have a wallet? Uh, okay, fine. Get yourself a wallet. So how's school? - Hasn't started yet. - [Older man] Well when does it start? - Next week. - [Older man] Well what are you plannin' to do next year? Are you plannin' to stay here? - I don't know. - I work Saturday, so I won't be able to take you out for a birthday dinner like last year. Why don't we go now, grab a bite? - I can't. I have some friends coming over. - What about Sunday? Your mother and I could come in, we can do brunch together. - Yeah, maybe. - 22. - Okay, wait here for like 10 seconds and then come up. Hello? What are you doing? - Oh, um, could I have a glass of water? - Yeah, it's in the right one. - So did you get what you needed? - What? - Did you get what you needed? - [Amy] Oh. - So your dad came? - Yeah, to drop off the rent check. - He wouldn't stay for longer? - I lied and told him I had friends coming over. Plus I think he got angry when he saw this. - I could hide your pack for you if you want. It worked well for me. - Well, that's my last pack. I'm gonna quit after that. - Really. - Yes. I can quit whenever I want. I have before. - It certainly seems like it's working well now. - Fine. I'll probably find them anyway. Want me to close my eyes or something? - Yes. - Okay. - You know I can hear your footsteps, right? (gentle acoustic guitar music) - He hasn't called. And he changed his Facebook status to single. - Well, you broke up. - I know, it's just weird. Everyone's gonna know and ask me about it. What am I supposed to say? You know he hasn't even called me once. I checked my voicemail. I don't even check my voicemail. You think he just doesn't care? Sorry, I'm venting. - No, it's fine, it's just. - What? - [Gavin] Nothing. - No, say it. - I just really have to go to the bathroom. - So go. - Well, I have this thing about doing it in front of other people. - [Amy] I'm not listening. - It's not really you I was worried about. - I don't know what to tell you. (Gavin sighs) (shower splatters) - I should have about five minutes or so. Maybe three now that I've waited. Gavin's in the shower. Amy's asleep. And I'm digging. (TV chatters) - [Voiceover] Hey, Carter, this is Felix. I was up last night when I figured you'd come in. I'm not sure if your flight got delayed or cancelled or what, but, um. I know I gave you this already, but my address is 225 East 5th, apartment one. Um, well, you have my number, gimme a call back, okay? (TV chatters) (door creaks) - [Amy] What are you doing? - [Carter] Um, I am looking for some shorts that I can't find. - [Amy] It's not a denim day? Yo, where are Gavin's cigarettes? - I hid 'em. - [Amy] Why? - He says he's quitting. - [Amy] Okay, but I'm not. Can I have one? - Yeah. (TV chatters) Don't tell. (fan hums) (Carter sighs) (siren wails) (baby cries) (softly pulsing instrumental music) (muffled R&amp;B music) Hey, um, one sec. - Uh, you wanna play? - Uh, no thanks. - What, what's your name? - Carter. - Frank. Where do you live? - [Carter] I'm actually from Colorado. - [Frank] Oh, what are you doin' in New York? - I'm looking for someone. - Uh, I have a cousin in Colorado. I went there once, it's so beautiful. You, you're sure you don't wanna play? - No, I'm okay. (bass-driven R&amp;B music) (door clicks) There was a baby upstairs that cried all night last night. I heard sirens, too. How do you sleep? - You get used to it. - I couldn't live here. It's too loud. - No, it's, it's good. You never feel alone. - Okay, so 43 people are attending. - How many maybe's? - 12. - You have a lot of friends. - Yeah, well, let's see how many of them actually show up. - You invited Adam? - Did I? - Why the fuck would you invite Adam? - I, I didn't realize I did, is he coming? - Maybe. - Shit. I, I was just clicking every name I knew. - How could you just see Adam and click without thinking? What's wrong with you? - Look, I'm, I, I'm sorry, it was an accident. Shit. - Who's Adam? - Her ex. We should probably get outta here. - Yeah. How far away are we from the Empire State Building? - Uh, far. - What about the Statue of Liberty? - Uh, it's kinda like a whole day thing. You have to take a, like a ferry, I think and it's, it's dumb. - Well, what about a museum? (Gavin groans) Is there anything you like to do here at all? - Did you go out last night? - No. - Thought I heard the door shut. - No. - Well then what's that mark on your hand? - Um, I, uh. I couldn't sleep last night and then it got really hot. I just went out for a drink. I'm sorry, I should've told you. - No, it's, it's fine. Where are my keys? - In the kitchen. (repetitive electronic music) - I take him to Washington Square Park. He asks how far it is from my apartment. I say six blocks or so and he calls me funny. And he laughs. And I laugh. So what do you wanna do? - Um, I don't know. - Hey, are you hungry? - Maybe a little. Dude, you don't have a wallet? - Nah, there, uh, too bulky. Come on. - I check the invite for the 15th time. I go to the liquor store. I try a bit. And I try a bit more. (cellphone buzzes) I hear something strange. And I dig. - Yeah, I was a big fan but I guess as I grew up I stopped watching and caring. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, what about you, you like sports? - [Derek] Gavin? - Oh hey. What's up, where are you off to? - [Derek] I have work in 20 minutes. - Where do you work? - At, at that record shop on Sullivan. I told you about that, remember? - Right, right, right, right. Uh, sorry, this is my friend. Carter, this is Derek. - [Carter] Hey. - Yeah. Uh, you go to school here, too? - Uh, no, actually I'm from Denver. - Yeah, he's, he's just staying with me for a couple days. (cellphone rings) - [Carter] Yeah. - [Gavin] Oh, uh, this is Amy, I gotta take this. - I got, I gotta run. - Okay, but you're coming tomorrow, right? - Yeah, for your birthday. - [Gavin] Hey, what's up? - [Voiceover] Where are you? - [Gavin] Yeah, we're just walkin' around the park. - Okay, so listen, I'm sitting on the couch and I hear something vibrating. So I walk over to it, it's Carter's bag. I opened it and there was a cellphone, Gavin. Cellphone. - You sure? - Yes! Will you please listen to me now? I'm not crazy. - Hey, let me call you back. - How far is your place from here? What? What? - You said you lost your cellphone, right? - Yeah, I think so, why? - [Gavin] &quot;Think so&quot;? - Yeah, why? - Amy said she found a cellphone in your duffel bag. That some guy Felix was calling. - She went into my duffel bag? - She, I mean, she just heard a phone ringing. I, I'm not trying to be annoying or anything, it's just. You take my keys, you go out. And now you have a cellphone. - 'Kay, it sounds worse than it is, okay? - Is Felix the friend you were supposed to stay with? - [Carter] Sort of. - Sort of. - Actually, um, he's not a friend. He is my dad. - Your dad lives in New York? - [Carter] Yeah. - So why aren't you staying with him? - I'm supposed to be, that's why he's calling me. I just. - What, are you mad at him or something? - I've never actually met him. And I've only spoken to him like twice on the phone. - [Gavin] But you've never seen him? - [Carter] No. - Don't you want to? - Yeah, I guess. - [Gavin] It's your dad. - Yeah. - He's probably pretty worried about you. - I don't know. - Well then maybe you should-- - Listen, you don't understand the situation, okay? Listen, I'm, it's complicated. I'm sorry, let's just go back to yours and I can pack my stuff. - I'm, I'm not gonna kick you out or anything. If you don't wanna see him then, you know, that's, that's okay. - So, so you don't think I should go see him? - It's none of my business. Just wait a second, okay? Hey. - Is he still here? - [Gavin] Yes, he's still here. - [Voiceover] Hey, Carter, it's Felix again. I called the airline this morning and, uh, they said that you were on the flight to New York so, um. Not really sure where you are or what I should do here, to be honest, um. Just give me a call back, please. - Hey. I think I'm just gonna go take a walk. - Where? - Just around. - [Gavin] Okay. - Cool. - Don't forget your map. - Don't you think it's a little weird that he could just come up with all of that off the top of his head? Like, isn't that too clever? - Still doesn't explain why he lied to you about the cellphone. But you never listen to me. Also I'm still mad at you for inviting Adam. - He went out last night. - Adam? - Carter. - [Amy] Oh. - He went to Eastern Bloc. - Did you go with him? - No. He took my keys and snuck out. Saw the mark on his hand this morning. - He took your keys? Dude, I, I don't know what to say. (knocking) - [Carter] Hey. - Hey. - Listen, I'm really sorry I lied to you guys. Kinda stupid really, but I thought I'd use some of the cash I had left to, uh, cook you guys dinner. - Uh, my gas doesn't work. - Shit. (fan hums) (baby crying) (Carter sighs) (baby crying) Gavin. - [Gavin] What are you doing? - [Carter] I'm sorry, it's really hot out there. Do you mind if I? - [Gavin] No, but, uh, do you wanna sleep in here? - [Carter] No, don't worry, I'm fine here. - [Gavin] Dude, it's, it's not a big deal. - [Carter] Really? - [Gavin] Yeah, whatever. - [Carter] Thanks. - [Gavin] Yeah. - I walked past the apartment today. - [Gavin] Which? - Felix's. - Did you go inside? - [Carter] No. - Did you ring the buzzer? - No. - Gavin. Oh, oh my God, sorry, my bad. - Dude, why are you not wearing any underwear? - Oh, shit! - You dirty little slut. - He's just a friend. - Mm, I bet. - It's not like that, he just wanted my AC. - Right, so is this something that you do every time I'm away? Just bring guys home. - Yeah, yeah, you caught me. - Mm hmm, mm hmm, I see that. So did he accidentally take off your underwear, this little friend? - No, actually, I took your advice and stopped wearing underwear. - You did, do you love it? - [Gavin] It's okay. - It's okay? PS, who's in my room? - Amy, I can wake her, sorry. - No, that's fine, I'm leaving anyway. - You're leaving? - I'm gonna go fuck Peter. You're not the only one with good friends. - Peter, what about James? - [Farah] Oh, I don't wanna even go there right now. - [Gavin] Why? What, I thought the two of you were getting along? - Dude, I don't wanna talk about it. - Okay, sorry. You'll be back in time for my birthday party, right? - Oh my God, happy birthday! Happy birthday. (baby talks) I'm so sorry, I totally forgot. But you don't have Facebook so it's not all my fault. - Yeah. - But I'm totally gonna be back in time, okay? I'm just gonna, I'm gonna suck his dick, wait for him to get hard again, fuck his brains out and then leave. I mean, it's Peter. I'll be back in like an hour, tops. - Okay. - [Farah] Okay. Now I need you to be honest with me. - You don't look fat. - Are you sure? - [Amy] Yeah, actually, with this, it won't move. - That's so good. - [Amy] So. Like that. - Oh, there you go. - [Gavin] Is this yours? - Yeah. - And these? - Yeah. - What are you guys doing? - [Carter] Nothing. - Nothing. - Farah's probably gonna wanna sleep here tonight. Since she's coming to the party. - Are you kicking me out? - [Gavin] I mean, I don't know. - Well where is she now? - Well, her and James are fighting so she's off fucking some other dude. - [Amy] Ew, that's so gross how she just, like, does that. - She's forward. - Yeah, you think? - Well, it works for her. - Okay. - [Carter] Ooh. Hey. Here. - Thanks. - Hey, um, happy birthday. - What's this? - It's a wallet. I remember you saying you didn't like bulky stuff in your jeans, so, yeah, it's kinda flat. - Where did you get this? - Well, I didn't have enough money to get another one or a new one, so, uh, it was mine. - No, I, I'm not taking your wallet. - I have another one back home. That is, unless you don't like it or anything, I. - No, I do. Thanks. - Cool. (rapid drumming music) - For you. - [Gavin] Ah, wine. Of course, thank you. - Do not let me have any. - Here. - [Gavin] Oh. A CD. - [Derek] It's stupid, but I'm bad at gifts, so. - No, no, it's cool, thanks. Hey, how ya doin'? Thanks. - [Voiceover] Happy birthday, brother. - [Gavin] This is what a man takes to heaven. Thanks for comin'. - I've been calling you. - I know, I can,. I've been really busy. - [Amy] Time is it? - What? - What time is it? - Midnight. - Nobody else is coming, right? - Are you drunk? Too drunk? Are you gonna be sick? Come on. Come on. - He doesn't like me. - You don't know that. - The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. Tell me about it. - Gavin would read something that depressing. - [Amy] I'm fine. - [Carter] Come on. - [Amy] I'm fine. - [Carter] Lay down. - Yeah. Oh no. - [Carter] You okay? Hmm? - Do you think I'm conventional? - No. - Yes, I am. - No, you're just a little drunk. - No, I'm not. - Is that what your boyfriend said? That you were conventional? Is that why he broke up with you or something? - He didn't break up with me. I broke up with him. Cool. Right? Cool. Cool. - Then why are you so upset? - I don't know. I guess I just wasn't really thinking about it. I just got anxious. It's stupid. - Well you almost attacked me with a frying pan. Wouldn't exactly call that conventional. - Oh yeah. Almost. Sorry I was a bitch to you. - It's okay. - You're leaving tomorrow. - Yeah. - [Amy] Do you think I'm attractive? - I think you're drunk. - Sorry. Was that too forward for you? Mama's boy. I'm sorry, I'm drunk. (bright pop music) - Do we have any more alcohol left? - I definitely gave Gavin a bottle of wine but I'm not sure where it is. - That's okay, I'll ask Gavin. - Ooh, wait, wait, come here, come here, no, no, don't go over there. You see, he's talking to my friend Derek? Fucking Gavin is just so ridiculously picky. - What do you mean? - I'm trying to, you know, set them up. - You're the one from Denver. - Yeah. - Hi. - [Carter] Hi. - I'm Grace, I go to class with Gavin. - Carter. - [Grace] Hi. - Amy, Amy. - Uh, right now, I'm working at this elementary school and I'm seeing how, how young kids have their minds develop. - [Carter] Oh. - You know, over time. - Yeah. - Um, like the other day, I go up to a student and I go, &quot;Hey, I like your shirt.&quot; And she goes, &quot;Thanks, I don't like yours.&quot; - Wow. - [Amy] I know, right? But it's funny because, you know, you know, that's weird, but at that age they don't know what lying is. You know? - [Carter] Yeah. - Like, they don't even know it's a possibility yet. - [Carter] Yeah, I guess. - But there's just so many things that they just don't know about yet because they're so-- - [Carter] Interesting. - [Gavin] Hey, where's the check? - What? - [Gavin] The rent check. The one that I put under Farah's blow dryer. Where is it? - I never touched it. - So it just magically disappeared. - Well, you're having a party. Maybe, maybe someone here took it. Or when you were cleaning up, maybe you moved it. - Nah, the only people that have been in that room are you and Amy. I saw both of you. - Dude, I never touched your rent check. I didn't even know you put it in there. - Gavin, I'm, I'm sure it's in there. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'll go look. - Why'd you go to Eastern Bloc? - What? - [Gavin] The bar, the Eastern Bloc. The bar, you went and you had the marker on your hand. Remember, I saw it. - Yeah, I, I went out, I told you. - You didn't tell me where. You didn't tell me you went to the Eastern Bloc. - What does it matter where I went out? That night, I followed Felix there, to that bar. I followed him inside. I didn't know it was a gay bar. Is, I mean, is this why you're so upset? - No. - You sure this has nothing to do with it? - No, it, I. Look, I. - I didn't take your rent check. I don't need your money, really. (fan hums) (muffled pop music) - [Amy] Hey, John. Is your brother with you? Adam. It's Amy, is he staying with you? No? Oh, yeah, no, no, I'll call you back. (solemn instrumental music) - [Gavin] Do you know where Amy is? - [Grace] No. - Do you know, uh, do you know if she left with Carter? - No. - Are you leaving? - Yeah, um, I have to go write, I have to get up early. I've been writing this one passage for weeks and you know when you just keep rewriting and rewriting and then you forget what you were writing in the first place. - Yeah. (laughs) Mm hmm. - What? - [Gavin] Oh, it's, I, since when are you a writer? - What do you mean? - Oh, you know, I just, you only took one creative writing class in college. I just, I just thought it was a hobby, that's all. - Yeah, happy birthday, Gavin. (people chatting) (clock ticking) - [Derek] Where's your roommate? - Who knows? She's insane. - Are you reading this? - Yeah, I, uh, I just started. - What's it about? - Uh, a bunch of lonely people. - Why would you wanna read about that? - How was your date? - What date? - [Gavin] You said you had a date with some guy. - Oh, yeah, uh. It was all right. - Are you gonna see him again? - [Derek] I texted him and he never responded. So, oh well. - I'm sorry. - [Derek] I should go. - No. Why? - I'm kinda tired. - [Gavin] Okay, well, will, will you just have one more drink? - I don't think I could drink any more. - It's my birthday. Please. Just a little while? (clock ticking) - Hey, hey. Hey. You all right? - Do you live in this building? Apartment one? - No. - No? - [Man] Are you sure you're all right? - Yeah. - [Man] Okay. - Yeah. - [Man] Take care then. (soft, repetitious electronic music) (baby crying) (door slams) (baby crying)
