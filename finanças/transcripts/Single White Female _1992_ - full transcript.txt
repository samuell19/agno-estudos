- So how many kids do you want? - I don't know. What's the statistical norm? - You and your statistics. One point two. - Okay, then I want 2.2, and I want them to look like you. - Oh, those poor kids. So, am I gonna be able to drag you away from your computer tomorrow to buy you that ring? - Sure. - Yeah? - So, is this gonna be a real wedding? - As opposed to a fake one? - You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with 200 people. - That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have any kind of a wedding you want. Underwater. You can have it at the steam room at the Y. Horseback. - Naked skydiving? - Naked skydiving. - Okay-. It's gonna have to be a small wedding, though. I haven't been in New York long enough to know very many people. - Except me. - Well, you're invited. - Thank you. - And my friend Graham upstairs. - Won't be long before you know half the people in New York. People like you, you know. But I found you first. - You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hello? - This is Lisa. May I speak to Sam? - Hold on a second. Sam. It's your ex-wile. - What? - It's Lisa. - Hello? - Yeah. - Sam, we need to talk. - No. - Why didn't you call me? - Because. - I'm hanging up now. - Sam, don't do this. I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here. - It's where you live. She's entitled. - Don't answer it. - Hi, this is Allison Jones. - Why does she do this? - Talk to her now. You're already up. - All right. - I'll get that. - Hello, Sam? Sam, would you pick up the phone, please? Hello? Please don't do this to me. - Lisa. - Sam, I've been sitting here since you left this afternoon. - Yeah, Lisa, honey, can we talk about this tomorrow? - You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then-- - Dammit, Allie, how the hell do you shut this thing off? - Sam, you said you were gonna-- Hello? Sam? - Uh-huh. Okay. Good-bye. - I take it back. She's not entitled. - I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie. I swear to God. - Oh, well, I feel a lot better knowing it was accidental. - She's very depressed, okay? It was the anniversary of our divorce. She heard we were getting married, and she'd been drinking. - I don't want to hear this. - I feel bad for her. I'm moving on. She makes me feel guilty. Believe me, it won't happen again. - Believe you, believe you? I'm supposed to trust you now? Think about how I feel. - Jesus, it's 4:00 a.m. - It's me, Graham. - Allie? - I'm sorry. It's... Sam left. I told him to. And, um, I can't be alone tonight. So I came up here. Thanks. - Allie, I let you sleep. - What time is it? - It's about 10. - Oh, my God! Oh, I've got a meeting. It's really important. Hi. - Hi. - I'm sorry I'm a little late. - No, no. It's worth the wait. - Thank you. - So. You can redefine your product on screen without going through an expensive redesign process. This is Allison Jones software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has. - Who do I get to run it? - I stay 'til everyone's up to speed. That's included in the quote. - Ah, the quote. That's the one thing I haven't seen. - Best for last. I think you'll find that's reasonable, as a ball park. - Here's where I was thinking of playing. It makes sense for you. See, after our last meeting, I made some phone calls. To your former partner, for one. - Well, I wouldn't rely too much on what she says. It was not a friendly split, and I did all the work. And she took all the credit, and she didn't like me telling her so. - Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled apartment which means your overhead is minimal, as is your client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you say you are. But that is the only way to prove it. - Well, I could go for something... - Oh, no, please, please. Don't embarrass yourself. That's my final offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about it. - I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report. - I look forward to it. - No messages. - What is this? A song cue? You're nobody 'til somebody loves you? - It's just living alone, you know? And the thought of buying those books like Cooking For One. It's just too depressing. - There are worse things than being on your own. You know? - Maybe it's all a sign I should go home. - Come on, you came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy interfere with my acting career? Assuming I had a career or a guy to interfere with it. - You'll find someone again. - Maybe I will. Why not? But the point is, if I don't, I don't. - I know that. I can do it on my own. - Absolutely. - I'll just get a roommate. You could always call him, Allie. - Not if I have a roommate. The managers couldn't really know you were going to live there. Well, that's the problem. It's rent-stabilized so you couldn't come on the lease. - Nice. Yeah, really open 'em up. I can't wait to get in here. Are you good with tools? - I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the incident yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have this sense that I survived something. All my therapists think so. Oh, God, a kitchen! I hate kitchens. Cooking, cleaning, anything feminine. I think it's probably my mother's fault. - I think this could work. If you feel the same, please give me a call. - Hello? Sam Rawson. Hello? - Excuse me. - Oh, hi. - Hi. The front door was kind of opened. Are you Allison Jones? Yes, Allie. - Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning. Are you sure you're okay? - Um... You know what, I'm not. Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow? - Why don't you just sit down? - No, I'm fine. - Let me make you some tea. - I don't think I had lunch, that's all. It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here, let me help. I use a wrench. Oh, wow! I'm so sorry. - If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli. - Oh, thanks. - Hedra. That's unusual. - I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling you. - Not Hedy like Hedy Lamarr? That's exotic. - Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school. As opposed to now, right? They're dry. Here. - Thanks. Oh, uh, you can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's the reason why I'm looking for a new roommate. - Oh. - Yeah. - Do you think there's a chance you guys might patch things up? 'Cause I don't want to move in and catch you on the rebound and then have things change. It would just be awkward. - Well, nothing's gonna change, Hedy. Except for maybe now my faucets will work. When can you move in? - No, really? - Congratulations. - Thank you. - I've got one friend, Graham. He lives right above us. - A friend? - Oh, no, not like that. He's gay. So anyway, it's not a real friendly building, but at least there's not a problem with privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door. - Yeah. - No problem. - I'll leave you alone, you know? I mean, whatever's good for you. - I don't mind. - Wow. - Hey, look, Allie. This could be good, huh? - Laundry room. I don't go in there at night. Too creepy. It's okay in the day, but still, lock yourself in. - This one? - No, that's the mail key. - This is creepy. - Oh, it's not bad. It's just kind of old. Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use the screwdriver. Excuse me. - Which floor? - 11. - 14, please. - Okay! - Allie, look what I found. - I'm not sure. Hold on, let me check. Allie, it's Sam. Where did you guys learn to dress like that? I mean, it's just so New York. - I think you look very comfortable. - Yeah. I never know what looks good. - I think that looks nice. - Yeah? - But I found this, which I think will go great with that. - Okay-. Hey, what do you think? - I think you should get them. - Oh God, you like them? - I think they go with that dress. - You take them. - Well... - I'll just borrow them when I want to. _ God! I didn't know you were home. I was, um... I was, um... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been here two weeks, and I'm already in your room. I was just about to go through your drawers. - It smells nice on you. - Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just always wanted to try that. - Oh, God, no. Anything of mine that you want, just go ahead. Share and share alike. - Well, I don't really know about that. I'm an only child. Do you come from a big family? - Mm-mm. Just me. I, um... Well, I was supposed to be a twin... but she was stillborn. - Oh, that's so sad. - I grew up feeling a part of me was missing. You know? Allie. God! It's beautiful. Thank you. What do I owe you? Um, nothing. It's just a little housewarming. Forget about it. Oh, no, no. - Shh. They look beautiful on you. - I can't take these. - It's a housewarming. Thanks, they're great. Excuse me. Hello? - Talk to me. - No, Sam. - Why not? - No, it's not a good time. I'm not ready to see you. You're just prolonging something that's over. Look, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's somebody here right now. All right? Okay. Bye. - Why don't we order some Chinese? - Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message, thank you. - Allie, are you there? Allie, pick UP- Allie, listen. Please call me back. This is torture for me. I know you need me as much as I need you. I love you. I'll do anything to put this back together. Just call me. - Buddy. Oh, yes, what a good, clean boy. Yeah, you're gonna cheer her up, hmm? You're gonna cheer her up, and she'll let you stay? Shh, stay. - Yoo-hoo! - No messages. - I know I shouldn't have. But they were just giving them away at the market, and... Well, they said I could bring him back tomorrow. - Well, I hope they meant it. - Look. His name is Buddy. Oh, I had a dog named Buddy when I was little, so... Tomorrow, okay? I promise. - Shh. Oh, come on. Okay, come on. Shh. - You're working so hard. - Myerson better refer some clients to me. - He will. You're the best. - Oh, God! Hedy, thanks. I never would have gotten it done without you. - I love helping. - Crunch, crunch, crunch. - What a good boy. - Wait, wait. Come here. Family portrait. Ready? - Yeah. ' Buddy! - I lived a few weeks... While you loved me. Good-bye, David. - Ready to kill her yet? ' Who? Hedy? - Mm-hmm. - No, no. It's kind of fun having a girlfriend again. - I can tell. I was worried for a while there, you were so down. You were starting to look like a Kennedy wife. - You were great, Graham. I've just had to spend some time with her. She needed a lot of help moving in. Plus, I've been working like crazy. I promise I'm not avoiding you. - I've got you cornered now. Actually, I've been meaning to come down to see you. In fact, I was on my way to ask you something. Do you feel like cat sitting again? I gotta go up to Boston this weekend for my cousin's wedding. - Fun. Sure, I'll watch Carmen. - Great, I made you a set. You know which is which, right? - Yeah. - And ignore the litter box this time. I do. - That's so cruel. We'll be fine. - You know, I think I saw her the other clay, your roommate. You were leaving the building. At least, I thought it was you. Your backpack, this jacket. But when I chased you down, you were someone else, someone very nervous. - Oh, that's Hedy. I've thoroughly freaked her out about people knowing she's living in the building. I would have had you down to meet her, but she's shy. Well. Friday. - That'd be great. Make you dinner when I get back. - Hey, I thought you'd be at work. - No. - Don't tell me we have the same belt. - Oh, yeah. Sorry. - Listen, I have to talk to you. - You have to see these. Look. - Cookies for dogs. - Oh, they're great. - I had to get them. - Allie, can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah, sure! - Can you come with me and talk to me for a second? ' Buddy! - Woof! - I tried to let you know. - What are you doing here? Hedy! - No, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay? I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you. - Listen, I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me. Okay. - Why can't you just leave me alone? - You gotta talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend that I don't exist. - It's easier that way, okay? Is that so wrong trying to make it easier on me? - But people screw up. People do something wrong. And it was wrong, I admit it. And you just cut them off. You don't take my calls. You don't answer my letter. - Wait a minute. You lied to me! If she hadn't called, would I have found out? I think that's really scary, okay? Please, Sam, if you want to be nice, just stay away. - Okay-. - I know that there are some things that you just can't put back together and I was hoping that this wasn't one of them. - Well, I guess it is. And I didn't get any letter, so I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it. - Well, I sent it with the keys. - Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say? Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you. I have no excuse for what I did. Allie, you have to give me a second chance. - You really hurt me, Sam. - Excuse me. Can you tell me where the biography section is? - Towards the front against the wall. - Thanks. - Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message, thank you. - Hi, Allie. It's me. Um, I'm just calling to see if you're okay. Uh, call me at work, okay? My number's on the fridge. Okay, bye' - Say, next month. Would that give her enough time? - I don't know. We've just gotten her settled in. Hedy's been wonderful. I'm sure she'll understand. - Evening, Mr. Rawson. - I have an idea I must be in love with you. Has it hit you that way? Hey! It's not for you. - Would you like it to go on for always? - Does anything go on for always? - Well, one likes to think some things do. - Where the hell have you been? _ God! Hedy, what are you doing in my room? - I've been waiting since 6:00 last night to hear from you. I've been worried sick. Buddy was crying all night. I finally had to come in here so he'd calm down. - I'm sorry. I guess I just didn't think. - No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know? This is New York. Things happen. - Okay, okay- I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're making me feel like I'm 16 years old here. Hey. Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I just... Forget it. So, I guess you patched things up with Sam, huh? - Yeah. Well, I made him suffer. - Is that an engagement ring? - Oh, well, I... - It's a beautiful ring. - Thanks. - Really great. I'm sure you'll be very happy. You'll be very happy, and I'll be alone. - No, wait a minute. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean, God, if I can... - Why don't you look in the mirror? Huh? Look. You're in a different league. I know that. You have this great personality. You've got this great style. You're running your own business. You are always gonna find someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you wouldn't. Well, I guess you and Sam want to be together so I have to move out, right? Huh? - Well, not right away. Sam's gonna keep his place for a while and I know you just spent a lot on furniture. - Yeah, your timing is great, Allie. It's really great. You promised me that this wouldn't happen. Exactly this. - Nothing's happened, Hedy. Come on. I mean... Look, I'll talk to Sam. Maybe we'll move. I don't know. Maybe we'll find someplace like this. I don't know. But we'll see. We'll figure something out. Okay? - They tell me they're nervous. - Of course they're nervous. They're salesmen. They want to be sold. Let's set up a demo at the staff meeting. Something special, something different, you know? Maybe at night. You know, open bar, open minds. That's F9. - I'll set it up. Maybe I'll call you tonight after I check on some things. - Great. - What's 8796 Knox? What's this Knox? - Oh, no, that's Graham Knox. He's my upstairs neighbor. That was just for last night. It's the first one. - You know, I've got to admit I'm very impressed. - Well, maybe you'll start spreading the word. - You know, I could see I'm not gonna be able to afford you anymore. - Great. Just press enter. That's it. You thirsty? I'll be right back. - Well, you would know more about that than I would. - Oh, hi. - Allie, do you want to sit? - Oh, well, I guess I'll turn in. Good night, Allie. Night, Sam. - They're ready. - All right, just a minute. - They'll get cold. - All right, all right. Rawson, actually, is a Norse name. - A what? - Norse. - Well, it's thoroughly uninteresting. Hey. - Hi. We going? - Scrambled or fried? - This is fine. - Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent. You know, if you don't want to do this apartment thing today it can wait until I get back. Why don't we get away together, drive to Bucks County? ' Buddy! Come here, boy. Come on. Three's a crowd, sweetie. - It's all right, Hedy. He's fine! Poor guy doesn't know who's who anymore. - Why don't you and I take a day off, rent a car... - No, that's okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Thanks. - You guys got a good day for it, if it doesn't get too hot. - You don't have to do that, Hedy. You do enough already. - Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here. Oh! Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys would trust me with dinner. Do you guys know when you'll be back? - It's kind of an anniversary tonight, so I think we're gonna eat out. - Really? Wow, that's great. Um, well, good luck. - Thanks. - Good-bye. Buddy, come here. Come here, sweetie. I know. I know. Buddy, come! Come! Fine. - But this is half the size for twice the price of our place. You're far too nice to Hedy. - It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice. - Can you imagine going from the Victoria to this? Do you think we could smoke her out? - It would be such a mess. I just can't do it to her. I think I'm her only friend. - My God, what happened? - One of those balconies. _ Hedy! He's dead! Buddy's dead! - What? - You left the window open! How could you do that? - But I thought we could leave it open. I thought you fixed it this morning. - I thought I did. - It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for breakfast. Allie, it's my fault. Allie! - Allie? - Allie! Thanks, that pill helped. - You still going on that trip tomorrow? - Well, you know, she wants me to. - If I had just let you finish your work this morning... - Listen. If she blames anybody, she blames me. Okay? - Hello? Hi, Mitch. What? Oh, God. I know, I'm... No, I just... I'm just running a little late. I didn't forget. No, no. Just hold him 'til five, okay? Thanks. - You were terrific. But you know that, don't you? - Thank you. - And here I thought all the guys would resist you. As if anyone ever could. - Oh, no, thank you. I gotta go. I'm just cleaning up. - Now hold it, hold it. Not so fast. Now, everybody under me knows more than I do. I hate that. - Well, block off some time for me next week then. It's a little late tonight. - Oh, please, please. Just a taste. Something simple. Right now. - Okay-. Something simple. All right. Now, this is just the Mickey Mouse stuff, but it does come in handy. - Uh-huh. - Okay, enter the vendor's name. Oh, vendor. J-O-N-E-S... Allison. - Very good. Here you go. Contract price. Payments to date. Balance outstanding. Uh-oh. According to this, we should've paid you last Friday. That's all right, Barbara will handle it. - Not 'til I give her the word. - I hope you're satisfied with what I've done. - So far. - But this is it. I mean, well, there ain't much more. Except for a little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time if you want to set up some of those meetings with your colleagues. - I was thinking maybe I wanna keep you all to myself. Topper? - What are you doing? - It's just that you're so tight right in here. - Please don't. That's enough. Mitch! - Now look... - Come on. - I've been a good boy, haven't I? You've been a good girl, and we have nothing to prove anymore. This is your last chance to play before you're an old married lady. Let me turn around, okay? - That's better. Just a second. Fuckin' bitch! - Here. Take this. - I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so humiliating. - You're too nice. That's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't care how nice they seem. You always fall for that. - But what I did... It was like something inside taking over. It was scary. - No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He should pay for this. - He'll pay- I set up all my programs so that they have to, eventually. - What? I'm not talking about getting paid. I'm talking about getting even. - You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the money. I just took the job for the word of mouth, and now that's gone. It's like he's put me back to square one. - Only if you let him. You won't let him, will you? - What can I do? - Oh, Allie. And, of course, Sam's away. _ Hedy... - I didn't wanna say anything. How he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died... Especially when it was his fault. Hello. May I speak with your husband, please? - Who are you calling? - Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones. He'll take the call. - What are you doing? - Listen, you pathetic shit. You wanna hold on to your business? No, you listen to me this time, asshole. If you trash me around town, you are fucked. And your family is fucked too, you got that? It won't just be you. Ta-da! Let me tell you, he is pissing in his pj's right now. - Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me. Hedy, we really have to talk. - Allie, please. I have a surprise for you. _ Hedy! - Oh, Hedy, I'm really not up for this today. - What? No, no, no. It's gonna be fun. It'll make you feel better. I promise. Okay? And I'm paying- _ Hedy... - It'll be fine. Come on. - Thank you. - You've gotta be kidding. You just should've asked first. - But I wanted it to be a surprise. - Can I have Consulting Marketplace? - Sure. - This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind. - Thanks. I'm gonna take a shower. - Ellen Besch? Sam... - Want me to fix you something before I go? - No, thanks. I'm just gonna go up and visit Graham. - 'Kay. -'Kay! - I love myself like this. - Have fun. - Yeah. - I love myself like this. - Taxi! - Taxi! Don't lose her. It's very important. She has something of mine. - Do you wanna play? - No, thanks. - Come on, Jim. - Allie. Hey, Allie. Regular or diet? - Diet. - Something's different. - YES. Jim, you look like my sister's boyfriend. - Jesus Allie, what is it? - You've gotta help me, Graham. You've gotta tell me what to do. - Allie? I'm home. Allie? Allie! Goddamn it. - It's so weird. It was like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a shoe box in her room. Nothing she told me is true. Like, the twin who she said died at birth. It was in an accident when she was nine. And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do something. - Get rid of her. Call the police if you have to. If she's lying and stealing, you've got to get her out of there. - You're right. I'll tell her tonight. I can't just throw her out on the street. She obviously needs help. - She's a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight. - It's just that I feel responsible somehow, like I'm the only one she has. Except for maybe her parents. - Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or I go to the police, okay? - That was very impressive. I can be butch when I have to. I get it from my mother. If you're worried about her, I got a friend who's a shrink. Maybe he can help her. - on, God. Well, maybe after I talk to her she'll just leave. - Do you wanna sleep here tonight? - Look, don't tempt me. I just needed to talk it out. Thanks. She's not gonna chase me out of my own place. - When's Sam coming back? - Oh, tomorrow. - That's good. - Yeah. - Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting our hair down, these little air vents between our apartments carry sound. It's a weird acoustic thing. - Well, what do you hear? Oh, no. Oh, no. God. I am so embarrassed. - Big deal. I'm sorry I didn't mention it sooner. - I am so sorry. - You sure you wanna go down there? - Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it. Thank you for the tea. - You're welcome. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - Hedy Hedy? Hedy? - Jesus. It's a lot more serious than I thought. No. I know you can't diagnose over the phone. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. Phil, I never met the woman. She could be infantile or paranoid. I don't know. I'll tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from there, will you talk to my friend? She can tell you better than I can. - Fine, call when you get there. - Right, okay? Thanks. So, all right... You might hear from us. Love to Jack, and you're not charging me for this. Carmen. Allie! - Good night. - Hedy - I'm sorry. - Wait, Hedy. - What? - It's okay. Take it easy. We just want to get you some help. - No, please. Please! I didn't do anything wrong. - It's okay, take it easy. - I'm sorry, I didn't do anything. - I know, no problem. - Hello, Mr. Besch. You don't know me. My name is Allison Jones. I think my roommate, Hedra, is your daughter. Ellen... I'm not sure, really. She's been under a lot of stress lately, and well... God, I really would rather not get into this on an answering machine. Could you please give me a call? Or her? I'm sure you have the phone number. It's 212-555-9814. I'd really appreciate it, and don't say I called. Oh, thank you. Hedy! Hedy? - What? - Hedy, are you all right? - I can't hear you. - It's okay. I was just starting to worry. You've been in here so long. I'm making some tea. You want some tea? Chamomile. - Yeah. That'd be great. I'm not feeling really well. Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice. - Are you crampy? Sometimes tea helps. Something warm. And we could talk. - About what? - About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves. It's just crazy keeping two places like this. - I thought you wanted a long engagement to be sure you can trust him again. - Well, frankly, Hedy, that's my business. I'm sorry, but it is. - Uh-huh. It's me, isn't it? I'll change, Allie. I can change. - No, that's not it at all. You've been a good roommate. It's just that this is the man I'm gonna marry. I want us to start our lives together. - Well, he will cheat on you again. That's a promise. And when he does, don't come running to me, okay? 'Cause I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll... Hello? - Is it Sam? - Ellen, is that you? Talk to me, or your mother. Honey, we miss you. We want you to come home. - Don't call here again. - Ellen, listen to me. We'll stop sending the checks if you don't come. Promise. No doctors this time. Just come... - An obscene phone call. New York. Find someone else, jerk! - I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in tonight. - Just for a little while, okay? Sam'll call back if it's busy. I'm sorry, Allie. It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. I just... I don't want you making a mistake. - I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends, keep in touch. - Sure. - Hello? - Allie? - No, it's Hedy. Hi. Where are you? - I just came in from the airport. Is she asleep? - Yeah. It's after 2:00. Do you want me to wake her? - Yeah, tell her to surprise me. - Okay, I'll tell her. - Good night, Hedy. - Good night, Sam. Sleep well. - What? Hey, Allie, what are you doing? - Shh. Oh, geez. Allie? - No, I'm not Allie. - HEY- Hey, sleepy guy. I knew it. - Knew what? - I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be faithful. And now she'll know, hmm? - She'll know what? That you came up here and pretended to be her? I mean, my God, what is this hair? What is this supposed to mean? You're in her clothes. You're wearing her perfume, for Christ's sake. - You knew it was me. Come on. You knew, and you didn't care. Well... I think she should know that. - You think she's gonna thank you for that news, do ya? - Well, I don't expect you to understand our friendship. - Oh, she cannot fuckin' stand you, for Christ's sake! - That's not true. - Aw, bullshit! - Mm-mm. - You're too needy. You're always clingy. You're constantly in her face. - She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost raped her, hmm? - What? - Who took care of her? You were off on a business trip or screwing someone. - She never said a word to me about that. - That's right. She told me. So, don't try and make me think that we're not close. We lean on each other, and we protect each other. We're best friends. - You're nuts, you know that? I think you're outta your skull. - Yeah, well, sticks and bones, okay? - Oh, man, man. - Sam. - Don't touch me. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look... I know you wanna save face. I won't tell her. Okay? Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her that you're going back to your ex-wife or something. And I won't say a word. - Yeah. Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart, because I'm gonna tell her myself. ' No! - Fuckin' bitch! - HEY- Hey. - I'm sorry, sir, but the party doesn't seem to have checked in. Yes, sir. Why don't you try again later? That'll be fine. Good night, Miss Jones. - Good night. - Hedy Hedy... Hedy? - Oh, hi. I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start. - No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today. - There, I think that's it. I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs. That way I won't have to bother you two when I move. - Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out. - Well... I better get this stuff out of here. - I'll help. We can have breakfast when you get back. - And now, morning news break. We go to midtown Manhattan... - Police found the body of a man brutally murdered early this morning. Identification of the victim, a white male around 30 years of age, is pending notification of next of kin. A witness I spoke to described hearing the sound of a struggle emanating from Room 612 around 4:00 this morning. - Atherton Hotel. - Um, Sam Rawson's room, please. Room 612. - I'm sorry. There's been an accident. I think you should speak with... - Allie? What are you doing down there? - I just suddenly felt sick. It was the funniest thing. I hope I'm not pregnant. - Let me help you. - I'm fine. - Let me get you some water. Hey. Drink some. Okay? Feeling better? - Yeah. I'm gonna go out for a while. I'm feeling much better now. - I thought you said breakfast. - It's in the blender. I gotta go. - Dressed like that? - Well, I'm just gonna go upstairs and see Graham. He called while you were out. - Well, still, if you're not feeling well you should wear more than that. - Maybe you're right. - Leave the door open so we can talk. You know why I think you're sick? You're upset about Sam. You know Sam's dead, don't you? Yeah. We don't have much time. - You didn't do it, Hedy, did you? You couldn't have! Why, why? - Allie, he came in my mouth and then tried to beat the shit out of me because I wanted to tell you. You know, it was an accident. But... He deserved it. Okay, come on. The police will be here soon. - But... But you shouldn't run. It'll only make it worse. I know you weren't yourself when you did this. - I know. I was you. Who is this Hedy, anyway? No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy. You have to come with me, Allie, or they'll put you away. - Hedy, it'll never work! Besides... People have seen you. Just calm down. We'll call a lawyer who could help, or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police or something. Why are you making me do this? We're friends, Allie, and you could be in a lot of trouble without me. But I'm not gonna leave you. That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go- Come on. Up. Up, UP! Let's go, go, go- Come on. Come on. No, no, no. Up to Graham's. Come on. No, no, let's not involve Graham. Let's just leave. - He's already involved. - Nobody's home. - Use these. Come on. Go on, hurry up. Go, go! - He must be sleeping. We were up late last night. Graham? - He can't hear you. - Wait'll you see me. Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking like you anymore, can I? Okay, now, Allie, don't laugh. Ta-da! - Five years ago, these magnificent creatures... - How's that, good? 23 and 24 are the movie channels. I gotta cash a paycheck. So, I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate to be alone. Okay, are you good? Are you comfortable? All right. So, um... Well, when I get back, we'll do your hair too. Okay? Be good. Bye. - What's the part this time? - Excuse me? - You're an actress, right? You're never the same person twice. - Oh. - I like it. I just thought the other was more you. - Well, maybe next time I'll try blond. - Really? I'm flattered, thanks. - Miss Besch.

The people you hated I hated. People like you don't care. You're just like that stupid girl in Tampa. She called my parents too, told 'em all my secrets. You want to put me away, huh? I can't... I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie. I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't... Oh, God. What? What? - Please. - No. - Don't make me leave you, Ellen. Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

I'll go see. I can't find it. - I know I saw it somewhere. Maybe it's in the kitchen. No, no! no] - It's going down. - Excuse me, miss? IS this 1203? Is Graham Knox at home? - No, he's on a cruise. - Actually, I'm looking for a woman. Allison Jones. Do you know her? - Who are you? - Mitchell Myerson. She did a job for me. - There's no one named Jones on this floor. - Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I did contact her here once. - Well, I'm the only one here now and I never met her. So, if you'll excuse me. _ Oh, sorry. Let me get that. - This is hers. You do know her. - What the fuck is going on here? - Be careful. She's crazy. - Get off of her. - What? - You think she wants you touching her? Huh? I said get off her! Okay, okay- I hear you. I'm gettin' up. - Hurry. Where is she? - Don't worry about her. I took care of her. - I don't wanna try to be loved anymore. I don't wanna be scared anymore or to kill anymore. I don't wanna kill anymore. I don't wanna be alone anymore. I don't wanna be anything anymore. I don't need a reason to kill myself. I need a reason not to. There isn't one. You wanna say anything special to anyone? Okay. Allison Jones. Go on. There. Now they'll know it was you. - No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was never that scared. Not like that. - Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being alone. I saved you from that... but you don't care. Did you know that identical twins are never really identical? There's always one who's prettier. And the one who's not does all the work. She used me, and then she left me. Just like you. Go on. Take them. Come on, Allie. It's nicer this way. - Okay-. - Allie! Please. Please! - I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not anymore. I'm like you now. - I'll kill you! - Get off him! Graham, stay inside! - Allie! - No, no, no! Allie? Allie! Hey, here you are. Don't make me come get you. Allie? Come out now. Come on. Allie! Allie! Come on! Come out now! Allie, please! I'm scared. Where are you? Allie... Why are ya hiding from me? Think I can't find you? Huh? Your goddamn shirt is stickin' outta the door. Allie... - I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral. Graham says that won't bring him back. He says I have to start letting go. He's right. Hedy's parents said that for years they tried to explain to her that her sister's death wasn't her fault, but she never forgave herself for surviving. So, every day I try to forgive Hedy for Sam. Then I try to do what she couldn't, forgive myself.
