I think everyone is just ready for some closure. Now that we finally know what happened to him. Right, Violet? I feel like I need to address the elephant in the room. Finding out about Hazel must have been very difficult for you, Nora. And you too, Violet. I feel... betrayed. Of course. But despite everything, he was my husband and I loved him. It's just something I need to work through. But for now, I'd like to focus on the arrangements. I'm here for you. For the both of you. I'll start digging into the paperwork and uh, we can schedule a will-reading before the service if you'd like. ♪ Maya: After Scott's first wife died, we had a thing. Oh. I thought it would grow into something more, but one night I went to a charity event. Scott was there. And so was Nora. Of course, they uh, hit it off. So you were upset he started dating Nora? (laugh) Surprised is more like it. Anyway, she found out we used to be an item and didn't want me around. Honestly? It is water under the bridge for me. But maybe she felt threatened. Who knows? (phone chimes) Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry, my security camera is so sensitive, they go off all the time. Hm. They sold me a deluxe package. Little did I know it would turn out to be FBI-levels of surveillance. (laughs) Did the police ever ask you for your footage from the night Scott died? I was away on a work trip. So, if they came knocking, I wasn't home. Besides, I live far enough away from Scott's house, they probably wouldn't even check here. Do you mind if I take a look at the footage? I'm just curious. ♪ Sure. (phone rings) I'm sorry. I have to take this. It's work. (phone rings) Hi, I'm in a meeting so please make it brief.

(beeping) Violet: Yeah, that's Faith's car. Nora's sister. Leila: You're sure? Positive. But wasn't she watching a movie with Nora that night? That's what she said. Could she have gone for pizza or something? Maybe, but her car was gone for an hour. That's a long time for take-out. Yeah. It also doesn't make sense.

I should have told you about Brad and his debt. It's not your fault. I really did love Brad. He was a huge part of my life for such a long time. (sniff) He just got into something bad. And now I'm responsible for it. No. You won't have to worry about that much longer. I'm going to pay Brad's debt myself. (sniff) Thank you, Nora. We will get through this.

You don't already know? There was a confession. Yes, but I think there's a possibility that Hazel didn't do it. I'm sorry, uh, you need to talk to Nora about this. I really have to go. Faith, please. I know you left the house that night. What are you talking about? One of the neighbors has security camera footage. Your car left the property. I haven't gone to the cops. Not yet anyway.

What are you talking about? (footsteps approach) I know that you killed my dad. How could you say something like that? Violet, tell me what's going on. Nora knew about my dad's affair this whole time. Peter, that is not true. Don't believe her. She's just a child. Leila: A child, huh? You mean a kid who figured out the truth about you, our dad, Hazel. Drugging your own sister. How could you accuse me of such terrible things? No, I am your stepmother. I've done everything for you. And you... I took you in. I welcomed you into this family. I gave you a place to stay! And paid off your boyfriend's debt! You played the role of a betrayed, grieving, selfless widow. But now we all know the truth. Peter, isn't it obvious what is going on here? These two, they are after me. Nora. Violet was always a troublemaker. Scott and I even discussed sending her to one of those rehabilitation centers. They're working together; they're trying to take Scott's money. They set me up. Scott has been a family friend for a long time. He wanted Violet to have everything. But he didn't have time to change the will, did he? Hm? So let's proceed with the reading. Scott changed his will with my partner before he died. Nora, it's done. (shout) (panting) No! Hey! (grunt) Don't you ever touch my sister again! I knew nothing good would come the moment you showed up. Nora! Stop! Faith, what are you doing here? (distant sirens) (sob) I called 911. Faith! (approaching sirens throughout) Why would you do this?
