Living on Love Alone Paris is beautiful, huh? I didn't notice you! Come with me. - You're Julie, right? - Yes. I'm pleased to welcome you to our company. Beautiful word, "company"! Well, yes. Uh, I'm glad... Well, that I'll be part of a team. You'll work under Arno. We're informal, okay? Have you met him? No, not yet. Arno is very nice, very open to everybody, that's quite unusual. Arno is a true artist. You can learn a lot from him. We are all very independent and are open to new ideas. The best way to charm Arno is to be natural, be yourself. He leads a healthy lifestyle. Doesn't drink or smoke. You'll understand after a while. You will start next week. Okay? Of course, it's up to you, I'm free. Well, it seems we agree. My name is Diane. Well, Julie. Thanks for coming. Thank you also. See you. Arno, that's Julie. She will work with us. - Welcome. - Thank you. Hello, Mom? I just come from "Alter Ego". Everything's fine! She was very nice and said that everything's okay. I start next week. What? For six months. No, that's fine, you just don't understand. Well, okay, I must go, and the money runs out. Yes, I'll come soon. Bye, kiss. Shit! Nothing's good enough. Kebab with fries, please. Any sauce? Garlic please. Hello daughter. We agreed on tomorrow. Tomorrow I can't. Do I disturb you? - No, no. Okay, Jamel, enough for today. - Alright. Still taking maths lessons? You must be a master already! He's quite good. - "He's quite good." You're funny! - How much is it? - 130. Damn. Here. - Thank you. "Ocean Breeze"? Why do I need that one? Instead of going out. I found a job. Great! After so many applications... And where? In a PR agency. PR agency? - What a garbage. - I like it. Washed with the shampoo? You've not just wet your hair? Where's a hairbrush? Like the apartment? Yes, everything is fine. Where is it now? In the 19th arrondissement. Nineteenth... Not a very nice area. Well, it's not dangerous. Put on the radio? If you want. Are your ears still buzzing? - It depends, today not really. A coffee and water please. - How much is a croissant? - 1.20?. And water please. A glass of sauvignon, please. Here you are. Now it's lunchbreak. You know about it? No one told me. - Arno rests at lunchtime. At 7th floor everybody sleeps. Not for long. Just enough to have a smoke. May I? - Sure. Have you been here a long time? - A month. I still don't understand what I shall do. It's a very strange way to work. On Monday serve coffee. Tuesday, give advice on design, and on Wednesday pick up Diane's kids at school. What are you doing here? It's only the second day, but something similar. Yesterday I was sent to the break room to pick up the demo, and then I was ready. Are you okay? Yes, just... just the cigarette. A strange taste. - Well, I've to go. - Me too. Shall we meet after work for a chat? Give me your number. I need the results of the consumer research. I can do that. Thank you. See you soon. They came from London yesterday. Arno's happy. The customer has approved our proposal. Could you organize a meeting with the European Art Directors? - Next week? - Yes. No problem. What is this? - A project for Shisheido. No, no, we're changing a lot. Looking for designers. Yeah? I... - You like children? - Yes... Okay, do your work. See you. I want to eat. We'll eat soon. But I want it now. No, Emil, it's soon our turn. Always wait! But you wanted to watch the pirates! We've got money from mom. - Stay here, I'll buy you a waffle. Emile is gone. What? Where to? Probably for the waffles. Have you seen a little boy? - No, I'm sorry. Come, Rosalie, we must find him. Go ahead, I don't want to miss you too. You have not seen a boy, blond? - No, I'm sorry. Rosalie, come on. Come on, I said! We need to find him. You haven't seen a child? I see 50 children in a minute. - Little boy in red shirt, about seven. - Your son? - No, the agengy director's... Don't worry. We'll fix it. Balloo! The girl lost her child. Can you help her search? - I go with Balloo? - He'll help you. Come on. Good luck. Are you nuts! You can't leave all alone! Oh, I'm sorry, Emil. I'm just so scared, your Mom would be so too. Hey. What's up? They were all in panic. Diane looked for you everywhere. I told her that I will take care of the files. She forgot that you told her. She left it to the new one, Daphne, a redhead from the design school. She asked me to replace you. And said, "immideately!" Couldn't you get them yesterday? - It was Sunday. That's true. So how was it? Nightmare, I tell you. Well, I have the video included. See you! Daphne will work with us from now on. - Are you okay? - Yes. How you thought about food? Lunch? You haven't arranged it? - They can't go upstairs? - 16 people? Takes to much time. Usually we buy takeaway. You didn't order anything? Okay, we'll improvise. Should we have asked them to bring sandwiches from home? Well, I'll do it. I'll be right back. Everything's in place? 16 takeaway meals please. We've got Summer Evening, Wild Garden or Last Kiss? What is in them? "Summer Evening" is a salad with dried tomatoes and arugula with cold pea and mint soup and sesame cake... "Summer Kiss" is... What does Alter Ego usually order? I've no idea. Can't you look in the system with the client number? I'm sorry, I don't have time. - Give them a call maybe... - I can't. Well, here's the menu, choose something. I'd like a "Last Kiss". Arnaud? This is Julie. Julie... Your assistant. I'm sorry to bother you at the meeting, I just wanted to know what kind of takeaway meal you prefer... There's Summer Evening, Wild Garden and Last... You've chosen? Last Evening, 16 portions. You mean Last Kiss? Excellent choice. Your customer number? The last ones. - Can you help me? - Of course. - I hope there's no sauce? - No. Have a nice day! Here we go. Yes, Diane... I'm in a taxi. I'm getting lunch. I'll be there very soon. And here's the second... We rearranged. Daphne brought food down from the 5th. What I wanted to do. I had to do it like this. We always do the simplest. - But that sucks! - What happens? Are going to hit me also? I'd like to talk to you after the meeting. It's all right. Job Search Sales Manager, PR-manager... Excellent communication skills wanted... Bad deal with the Alter Ego? - Yes, they suck! Come on, forget it! Dance! - One Mojito. - Two, please. - What's your work? - I conduct polls. Awful! - No, it's funny. Today was the question "What is your greatest dream? " It turned out for most people it's a good job and a big house. What do you dream of? Being a longlegged brunette! - What nonsense! - It's the truth. You dream about what, Julie? I go home, I work tomorrow. Coming? I'll stay a while. Let's talk on the phone. - You live far away? - In the 17th. - Well? - I don't know. You'll like it. - Well then, let's go. - Ok. This is your apartment? Yes. It's so empty? Well. I gave everything to ex-wife. - Can I take some water? - Of course. How old are you? 41. 41! The first time I sleep with someone so old! You'll see, it's cool. Really? Better than 17? I must go. Could you borrow me 20 ?? I spent everything yesterday. That's all I have. - I'll call you. - Bye. Julie Bataille, I'm 23. I graduated with a degree in PR management. Address: Rue Tanger 18 19th arrondissement. I'm not married, no children. I have three years driving experience and speak perfectly English. I wish to work responsible on interesting projects, I am diligent. And I am a big a fan of your company. I'd be proud to be part of... What transportation do you use? Metro. And no other? If necessary, I can borrow a car. Why do you want to work for us? Well, as I already said, I am big fan of your company... Why do you talk to us this way? Are you talking like that usually? You see, we emphasize on mutual trust with our employees. You exercise? Yes, swimming. What else can you contribute to the team? Well, I'm young... - But that's not enough. But I've much experience. I worked with publishing... But you lost that job? The company couldn't afford a regular employment. And Alter Ego? You didn't stay, although it was ideal for you? Yes, but there were two people at one position. Now you don't work? I have found spare-time work in a darkroom. 8 hours a week. That's far from your qualifications. Well, in addition, you need to have sales skills. In what sense? Now we will make a small test. May we film you? Yes. You need to convince a customer to buy a 12-volume art encyclopedia. We've hired an actor, who waits for you next door. It will help us to estimate your ability to improvise. - Right now? - Yes, next door. All right. See you. - Who's there? - My name's Julie. I work for a publisher and I'd like to introduce our products. A publisher? You will come no way here, I have neither time nor money. I have no money me neither, but aren't you curious anyway? May I come in? How nice it's here! It's not my apartment. You live with your parents? I visit my grandmother. And where is she? Hush, she's sleeping. - Well, then we whisper. - Sit down. Look what you could show her, when she wakes up. What's this? Beautiful! - Artbooks. - Classy! Pasargadae... Achaemenid. Grandma would love this. She was looking for such a book all her life, can you imagine? She won't believe... that I eventually found it. What was it? Something about his grandmother. Louder please. I'll tell you a secret. I'm not her grandson. No? I am a social worker. Helping older people so they can live at home. What happened? It amuses you? Mademoiselle... I'm sorry, How do I print photos from a flash drive? There's a machine over there. Over there? Patrick, can I take my break now? All right. Can you work tomorrow from 5 to 9? Yes, of course. Jennifer, come over here. Hi, it's Julie. I have a break. Is this your car? - Yes. - But it is... Yellow. Well, yellow, yes. Do I really have to use this? Shouldn't you provide a car? Well, forget it. Insurance, registration papers... I'll show you how to shift gears. - Khalil Ajam? Who is that? It's not yours? No, a friend's. He's out travelling. Look... The first, second, third And the fourth. In order to reverse, push, and pull right. Push the brake to stop... Otherwise, great sound... Just kidding. Turn-signal, headlights, high beam... - Janitors. - A normal car. Steering wheel, mirror, counter... Alright? Ininitially it was an automatic, it broke down and he bought a manual transmission instead. We had an accident, confused fourth and reverse. Not very smart. Thank you for borrowing it. Very sweet of you. What did they say? Will I get the job? You are sad and ugly and without humour, so you can be trusted. Have a pizza when you're ready? I'm ready at 9, but, no, today I can't. Then when you return the car? I'll call you this week. I have to go. Thank you. Damn! What a fool I am. Just as a normal car. Don't forget about the fuel, okay? Excuse me. Wake up! To work. Are you having breakfast in the car? I just came too early. I was afraid not to find it. What a mess. Just like my son's room, no place to put the legs. Let's not waste time. I hope we're ready before lunch. Will you guide me? No, dear, it's your job. I shall just teach you. Just ignore me, and I'll comment on it. So where do we start? Maybe, with one-family houses, they are the most interested. Excellent! You know the way? You've got no GPS? What kind of car is this? Yours? - No, someone else's. - From a friend. Maybe you'd change the friend. Well, arrived. What will you take? Well... Too many! Three or four at most. More they don't understand. The topics should be different. "Egypt" is always popular. "Museums of the World"... - Not good, it bores them. "Gardening". And... "Classical music". Come on! Back in half an hour with three orders, okay? Don't forget to mention that they have a week to regret. It helps. Door-to-door sale is always suspicious. Three rules for a seller: Good mood, good mood and good mood. Come on baby, do it! Well, next door! Hello, I'm from a the publisher, do you have a couple of minutes? Yes, here you go. Voila. And this is from '77, my wife and children in Hamammete in Tunisia. Just before the birth of Amelie, our youngest. - Your wife loved to travel. - That's right. We were in Turkey, Greece... We were travelling in Croatia when she fell ill. I'll be right back. Hello, I'm looking for a colleague. She's here. We were talking. We don't have time to talk. A coffee you can drink! Would you also like a cup? No, it's time. I'll bring "Sailing ships". All right. Good-bye. Have a beautiful day. Thank you. Do you ever use your head, damn it! What the hell do you care about his old photo albums? You're not a nurse or a social worker, you have to make him subscribe. I can imagine! Comes a young woman... "Take a cake, take one please..." "Ever been in Kairouan, and in Tataouine?" It wasn't like that. His wife had died and he needed someone to talk to. He needed to talk! Why with you? And me? I'm too old for this kind of game. I need cash, my three children love shopping, none of them has work. You're wasting my time, damn it! I never succeed. Nothing works. Nothing. I can't make it. I'ts too hard. I'm all alone, I'm 23, I never have any money... I had a job. I lost it. I've no idea how I shall pay my tiny flat that has no soul. I wash myself in the public bath. I'm scared, but nobody cares. No. Don't say such things. Life's not only black and white. It'll fall into place, don't worry. When you just relax it'll go the right way. I do it just for the sake of it, I don't care for it actually. I don't want to do it. I don't want to sell this stuff! Well, we all want something else actually. You're at the bright side of life. I don't see any bright side. Everything's just crap! Take it easy. Time flies fast, you'll see. At your age it's hard to believe but it passes quickly. I mean being young. I also had a hard time. I didn't want to work like this. The internet will take over anyway. Get out of it. You don't like it. Get an education. Yet another one. I wish I had given a damn. And gone abroad. We always think we could rather have done something else. I tell you, it's bullshit. Alright. Enough for today. Let's go eat. How old are your children? 13, 10 and the youngest 5. What's her name? Oceania. What's so funny? - I don't know. Just how you said it... I had to think of that toilet cleaner, you know, "Ocean Breeze". Why do you say that? I didn't want to offend. She's so lovely, my daughter. Don't look at me. I'm shy. I take the chance. I've rarely seen people like you naked. It happens once in awhile. Well... I'm going home. You can even stay here. Damn... How many cards I have! Look here. It could be a card game. Accord... Attacks... Aurora... Good name. I wanted to call my daughter... Yves Rocher... This is my wife. Here you go. You deserve it. It's too much. Take it, I say. Don't be shy. I thought you need money. Well? I'll rather give you money than donate to charity and other shit. Thank you. This doesn't mean so much for you like for me... I mean, I feel awful. Why do you say that? I'm sorry. Forget it. It's me. When I have sex in the afternoon, it makes me sad. I have to go. See you. I want to pay for the room. Monsieur has already paid. Are you hungry? Pizza's cool. I doubt it. I'm a pizza philosopher. I'm an expert on Plato, Marx, Nietzsche and others, as well as for the exact time for cooling down pizza. What? The pizza philo. Philosophy at daytime, pizza in the evening. Like in the countryside. - Never been here before? - No, never. Didn't you play here as a kid? No. I just recently came to Paris. You look like a Parisienne. My mask. Where are you from? From Melun. I love Melun. You can have back your friend's nice yellow car. I don't it need any more: I quit. Excellent. Well done! It was a lousy job, and I also need a car soon. Are you really an actor? Not at all. I just made a show. They paid well. I'm good in acting, they believed me. Actually, what are you doing? Actually... Well, okay. You know, if you want money, it's better not to work. You need to work a lot for a little money. You could earn a lot as a model. I know. I'm afraid I can't pay my flat. Well, it's not a problem. I know a work where you can earn enough to pay your flat. What's that? Help my friends. In Melun. Go on! They make pizza. Sell pizza, get out pizza. And that works? They make the real stuff. Well, the word gets around. I'm going south next week. A friend offered me a house at the Spanish border. It's actually his father's. I'm going to fix some things. I'll take our nice yellow car as you call it. Like to come with me? Spend the summer there. I can't. I need to find a job. I don't want to hang around in this photo shop. As you wish. If you don't find anything you can just come. I can offer you a train ticket and an income receipt. You're tempting me. It's a pity. I'd like to go swimming. Is it far from the sea? I don't know, maybe half an hour by car. The best I know is spending a day on the beach. Why do you think it is so nice by the sea? Because... Because... Why do you think it is so nice in the park? A little race? Where to? See the tree? The winner may sleep with the loser! What did you say? Let's go to Spain, Madrid. - I've no money. Damn money. It's not important. I invite you. What is important? That you leave this nasty job and go south with me. Come on! Leave me alone. You don't want to go? Like to stay here, huh? With that other guy? Who's as terribly sad as you? What do you think of? I don't know. Of those whom I slept with. Thank you for sharing! And you? Slept with many women? No, I've not! With one or two and not for real. - You know where I wanna go? - No. To Barcelona. - Is it you, dear? - Yes, it's me. You're too late. We agreed on noon. It's broken. - Hell, I forgot. - Maybe, say hello? Service Center? Washing machine. You're so pale? Yes, fine. Where're Laure and Mathieu? Service Center. They went on the market. Damn! I must eat something. Damn, this answering machine. I hate things break. You don't eat enough. You look tired, is it your work? Is it? Look! A gift from the team. They had arranged it with champagne and canap?s. It was very nice. You can try. Marie and Yasmina had a speech with memories of me. "I remember Coco at a seminar in Montreal, I remember Coco on an intern training... " I remember Coco taking care of us. Just laugh at me. I haven't forgotten... Good stuff. A little belated. Since you don't come so often nowadays... buy a gift to yourself. I'll open it later. Thank you. Mamula. I'm back soon. With love from Mom Damn! - You rearranged my room? - A little. You only come rarely. This could be a guest room, well, or... or for rent, why not. It's a sofa bed. No problem to sleep on it, it's very comfortable. Have you seen your father lately? Yes, I met him. Recently. He wasn't better. If that's your question. We tried everything with him. I hope you're aware of it. I know. Are you still alone? I'd like you to have a suitor. Now they came. Boom! Boom! An elephant walks through the savannah! Remember John and you playing that? You were always laughing. Corinne, do you have a mixer for lettuce? Yes, of course. I like this one, we've got it in Stockholm too. What beautiful roses. Where did you get them? In the flower shop at the station. Do you want? Pull hard! Great. We're lucky, the weather is good. Can I help with anything? I played with your son. Kids are cute, right? What are you waiting for? Becoming old and ugly, while taking care of them? Don't! Don't eat now. How's the barbecue doing? The meat is fried. Well then, everybody take a plate and go out. Beautiful roses. You want, Luke? A new one? When I retired from work. Strange. I worked all my life, even when you were born. It was the perfect work for a woman. What will you do now, Corinne? She doesn't like to be called that. Call her Coco. The wrong ones... Well, I'll be traveling. With cheap flights you go anywhere. Or with an association maybe. Wherever people need me. Then you don't need to fly. What about you? Will you stay in Sweden now? Didn't we tell we moved there permanently? Well... Mathieu first said that you just try and come back, if you don't like it. It must be said that the quality of life in Sweden, doesn't compare! For the kids it's night and day. Especially night. Clown. Stop playing the most intelligent. You're alone, but with children, it's impossible to live in Paris. So why return to Paris now? Well, it's expensive to live in Paris. Really. How much is your flat? 600. 600 ?! For one room? That's madness! But how's work at Alter Ego? Come on, tell. You like it? Is it interesting? Well, yes... It's OK. Little brother had to fix it. Say thank you! Apart from low wages, 10-12 hours a day, over-time on weekends, it's great! You don't understand, Julie. For a beginner it's well paid. What exactly are you doing? I'm the assistant of an art director. I thought I'd participate in discussing projects and texts, but no. I should play nanny for their kids. Diane calls me in the weekends at all times. I'll stop there. That's not funny! I really worked hard on them so you got the job. I'm fired. Really? What have you done? Nothing. I don't know. They said that I'm "Too impulsive and not natural. " I fixed you work in the best Agency in Paris and you got fired? Anyway, they're all assholes. A bunch of assholes? Will you start like Dad back then? You're just spoiled a child. I work 60 hours a week, moved to Sweden... She didn't lift a finger! Don't like to look after the kids, it's disturbing on Sundays! Wake up, the world has changed! People live different. I don't want such an Ikea life! Do you know anything better? No work is nothing. Isn't it time to earn your own money? Sure. Only it's not life. You're so dumb! I wish I'd be dumb enough to go to work and be happy! Is that a life? Mom, please, tell her to shut up, I can't, I've heard it all from my idiot-father. Look where he's now! Lives like a cur in a kennel! It's you who lives like a cur! Changed the car? Well, I rented it. You're really paying the rent? This is for you. For me? Try. It's is a gift. Not bad. Perfect. Where do we go? I'll show you the house, and then we take a walk, okay? As you wish. It's still far? A little remote. Sounds good. This way. It's beautiful here. Why are you laughing? I laugh because I'm happy. What you mean, happy? I'm happy because... Because you're here. I'm glad you came. Thought I wouldn't come? Yes. At first I thought you had forgotten, or you don't want to. Why are you here? I don't know. We just arrived. Nothing to do in Paris. Nothing else isn't enough. Yes, that's true. Nothing else is better than not coming. I wanted to see the south. Put down the beer. You are beautiful. No. I'm not beautiful. Well, you're ugly. Ugly ugly. Put it on. I'd like to be like you. A man? What an idea. No, I'd like to... I'd like not to give a damn like you. It must be great. I want to meet a guy who says, "I'll take care of you". A guy who doesn't care for anything, but does everything for you. Well, I'd like such a serious girl like you who knows everything about about people like me. Beautiful. You like it? Are you sleeping? Liar. I'm just thinking. What do we do now? I don't know. Don't you like it here? More coffee? I'll get a cup. Have you found everything? There's no running water? I'll get it from the fountain in the village. And for washing? If you want there's an outside shower. Didn't you actually come to do repairs? Well, it seems in good shape? - Well, yes. - It's fine. I don't know. I don't understand what you're living on. Tomorrow I must do something. What? A quick drive to Spain. To do what? Smuggling? Just for a friend. The car is prepared. And I'm alone here? It goes fast. Takes only the morning. Like to come along? A couple of hours, 3000 ?. Like this? - Wait. Come on. Hold it tight. A little padding. Damn! What an awful noise! Incredible that such a thing can kill someone. Damn, it's really not a toy. Would you kill for money? For money not. When you did it... This is gangster stuff, why have a gun? Just in case. You think I'm a bandit? No, but aren't you afraid to kill someone innocent? Or get killed yourself? Never thought about it. What do you think now? Nothing. It's impossible to not think. We think even when we're not thinking. I did think nothing. - I don't believe you. - It's true. Come on! Try not to think anything. There you go. I don't think anything. You're lying... And now? Still nothing? - Yes. Come on! It's true. I don't believe it. Nobody can not think with a gun at his head! Are you sleeping? That's a lie. What is it? Nothing. Not true. What's up? Nothing. I shouldn't have come. What am I doing here with you? I don't even know you. A guy who walks around with a gun. I'm scared. I want to go back. I need to look for work in Paris. Drive me to the station. - I won't take you to the station. - Why not? There are no trains. Don't you need a little rest? I can't rest, I don't work. That's not the reason. Slave in that photo shop again? Shall I drive? Are you scared? Are we far from the border? About 15 minutes. Put on someting else? Have a CD? No, I'm sorry. Really? Aren't there any CDs? I don't have CDs. This one, I suppose. I think so. What's in it? I'm sure you know. I can't tell you. Say it... Weapons. Happy now? I thought drugs. Drugs... You know what? I don't know where we're going, and what we do there. But it's fun. Hurry up. My battery's dead, Do you have a phone? I forgot to charge mine. I'd be happy to help, but I don't have a phone. Well, lucky me. There's rarely someone your age without a phone. I don't know, ask someone else? Well, have a good trip. Holidays are over. Quick! - What? - A strange guy. - What did he say? - Wanted to phone. - And? - Don't know, but it was strange. Damn, there he is. - What? - Don't look at him! Go on. Stay calm, we can still get stopped by a patrol car. Just exhale. We need a black Renault Clio, 812 ZMK 66 between the pizza kiosk and sales wagon. That's it. This one? Yep! 3,000 ?. Better than on TV, right? Is that really 3000 ?? I can't believe it. I thought it would be much more work for that money. It's great, right? What shall we do now? Buy food? I'm hungry. - Me too. - Come on. Monsieur, please come with me. - Why? - You know why. What's up? Mademoiselle, stay calm. Well, here's the money, you leave me go? I can't do that. I need your passport. Take it before I start to cry! You could have thought before. What a nonsense. Take it! It's Daoud. I need help. - Stop it. - Come on. - You fuck off! - What the hell? Police! Stop the car! Hands on the wheel! I wanna see your hands! Out! Hands on the hood! Spread your legs! What are you doing... Out of the car. And no nonsense. Your name? Passport? Don't have a passport? Search her. Stand up. That's all. Name, age, profession. Julie Bataille, 23 years old, unemployed. What will you do with the money? I don't know. Maybe travelling. And when it's finished? We'll find out. We can sell the car. And there it ends. What do you mean? For the bandits. I thought you meant the love. No, love is never ending. You believe that? - Yes! True love lasts... forever. And? What? Nothing. Subtitles: The Huge Animal From The North
