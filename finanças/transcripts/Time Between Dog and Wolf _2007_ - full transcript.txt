Dad! Get in! What are you doing, Ari? Final Episode Yes. Come straight to the villa. Make sure no one is following you and watch out for patrols. Ah Hwa will fetch Madam. I think we should drop Miss Ari here. No! If we separate here, we might not be able to see each other anymore. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you until you leave. Ari... Please. The closing meeting is ready. All right. Byun Dong Suk is dead. All the art pieces displayed at the auction were confiscated as evidence... and members who were left at the event venue were arrested. What about the production plant? Yes. Three assault teams were sent in, and secured all the production equipment and raw materials. We have arrested everyone involved in the transaction. What happened to Mao and his members who ran away? We've informed the Immigration Office to make sure they don't leave the country. We have sent wanted posters to the police and strengthened the inspection searches. Okay, good job, everyone. It seems Cheongbang is almost destroyed. Let's work hard until the end. Good job. Soo Hyun has disappeared with Mao. So? We have to quickly find out where Mao is. The mission is over and we don't know what Soo Hyun will do. Didn't you hear Team Leader Park's report? We have done everything possible. The only thing left to do is wait until Lee Soo Hyun contacts us. Suh Ji Woo is with them too! That's good. He won't be able to kill Mao in front of his own daughter. Go back. Not only the police, but other groups are looking for your father as well. It's dangerous, so go back. What about you? You have finished your job. What is there left to do? There is something I haven't finished. By any chance, about that work... Do you remember what you said to me in Thailand? That you were going to find and take revenge on the person who killed your mother... By any chance... was my father the person you were trying to shoot earlier? Kay! I need to talk to him, so go inside first. Okay. Who do you think did this? What? The traitor. Only Director Mun and I know the location of the production plant. Who gave the information away? If both of you are the only ones who know, then it must be Director Mun? Although he is shrewd, he doesn't have the nerve to betray me. I'm sure someone else leaked it. Kay, can you think of anyone? Well... Myoung Jae, I have a favor to ask. Tell me. Can you find out what is in ahjussi's computer? Especially files related to Chief Jung. Your boss is destroyed and yet you are staying quiet. It seems you have loyalty. You really don't know where Mao is hiding? Team Leader Oh, let him go. What? We don't need to waste our time with someone who doesn't want to talk. He will either be indicted by prosecutors or be taken care of by the yakuzas or the triads. Whatever happens, I hope you keep your loyalty. Hold on. The fake passport will be ready today. I see. Is it okay to leave like this? Other groups are targeting us, and CheongBang's elders will probably not leave us alone. Kay. In this field, you won't fail if you have three things. Confidence, a trustable subordinate, and money. Oh yes, Kay. Yes, President. Before we leave tomorrow, drop Ari off. Her road and ours are different anyway. We have to let her go. This is Kang Min Gi. Come to my office for a minute. Macau Bank... secret account? According to that friend, it's enough to buy a small island. As long as they have that fund, they can rebuild the group not just in Thailand but in any country. So? The account is registered to the boss, so it seems Mao has done it himself. He's been carrying around the USB which holds the information. He probably has it right now too. Lee Soo Hyun will probably not contact me but he will call you, right? Are you thinking about asking Soo Hyun to get that for you? If he can get me that information, I can protect his identity and fulfill any requests that he has. It's an unusual action for NIS. Do you think Soo Hyun will believe you? That's why you have to persuade him. So Lee Soo Hyun won't pick extreme solutions like revenge. Your responsibility as a brother is bigger than that of a colleague. You didn't care about Soo Hyun when he disappeared... after foiling Cheongbang's transaction. And now that you need that information, you do what? Identity protection? Unusual action? You were always like that. Not just Soo Hyun, you also used Byun ahjussi... and then threw him away! Why do you think they were used? After Byun Dong Suk was arrested by the Thai Police, he made a deal with me. You can say our government denied his existence... but he too received money on the condition that he hide his true motives. Lee Soo Hyun accepted the undercover offer in order to take revenge for his parents. No one pressured nor used anyone. Both of them accepted according to their necessities. Dad. You didn't sleep yet? Yes. Are you worried? About what? Everyone is looking for you. Are you really okay living like this? Why? Do I look pitiful to you? Yes. We had a good relationship a long time ago. Don't you remember? Yes, we did. Back then, if you hadn't gone with your mother and had stayed in Thailand... We would have had a good father-daughter relationship right now. It might have been the opposite. Being around a father who commits crimes, I would have become a daughter who is always nagging, telling you to stop and to quit everything. Yes. That's possible. Ari. Yes. When I leave... we might not be able to see each other anymore. I know. Wherever you are, whatever you do... Just remember that I love you. Ari's massage is the best in this world. Really? Yes... it's refreshing. Don't make others unhappy anymore. Especially starting with you, dad. Are you going somewhere? I'm going to take the young lady back. It's the President's instruction. Oh, hyung, a while ago I dreamt that we were back in Bangkok. We received VIP treatment wherever we went and we were doing very well. When we go to Thailand, it will not be a dream but a reality, right? What's wrong? I'm leaving now. Do you want to go with me? What is it, Kang Min Gi? What bombshell declaration are you about to make by creating this atmosphere? I'm requesting help from both of you. It's about a secret undercover plan with Agent Lee Dong Jo... that Chief Jung started which took place in Thailand a long time ago. Even though it was impossible at the procedural phase, there is a suspicion that he enforced the plan. As you said, whether there is a problem at the procedural phase or not, why are you bringing up an old case? I need to check the NIS Internal files for the details but my access is limited. I hope that both of you can help me. You want to destroy Chief Jung? If needed, I can do things even more serious than that. Jerk, Kang Min Gi... It's not an old case. The same thing is being repeated right now. What are you talking about? Agent Lee Soo Hyun is currently in an undercover plan. Who? After making a new identity, you will probably need 2 weeks to get settled in the country of your choice. But I'm sure once you arrive, you will want to disappear from our sight. You know me. There is nothing to worry about. I have no intentions of involving you in anymore plans. Maybe because it's the last time... I want to believe what you said. Then my promise is up to here. What about yours? There is one thing I want to ask. You put my father in the plan in Thailand and failed. You eventually made me an undercover too. Was it planned from the beginning? From the first time I joined NIS? Regardless if I lost or regained my memory... leaving me behind in Cheongbang too? I don't question the causes. My task is to decide the next step based on different outcomes. Deciding what would be best for our country and our organization. Like these decisions. You don't care about the steps and methods. There is a saying that if the end is good, then everything is good. Don't you feel lonely? You don't understand anyone, and don't ask anyone to understand you. You calculate alone and decide everything on your own. Lonely... Lonely... Ji Woo! What happened? Where are you now? Don't worry. I'm fine. I was with my father. I know. I heard he was being chased by the police. Is he safe? Yes. He's leaving Korea today. Also, he won't be coming back. Okay. Let's talk more when we meet. Dad, thank you. For believing in me and being understanding. You can't say such things in a parent-child relationship. Dad, I'll call you again. Did it go well? Yes. Everything is finished now. Please face the screen. Verified. What is it? What is it you have to tell me? Lee Soo Hyun... You put him in an undercover plan, right? Even though you have the power to select and put the black agents in, this case is obviously misconduct. You also used Lee Soo Hyun's father, Agent Lee Dong Jo, as an undercover agent... and did things you shouldn't have done. Agent Lee Dong Jo doubted this undercover plan and requested that it be terminated. From Byun Dong Suk's findings in Thailand, we found proof that you ignored this request. As team leaders, as long as we know about this case, we are not going to let it go lightly. We'll be going. Is something going on? The atmosphere seemed serious earlier. It's nothing. Hyung-nim! Chief! Explosion Time: 12:20 Kay... Kay... - Hey, move this there and be careful. - Yes. Madam. Kay hyung will go straight to the airport, so let's go. President. You guys head out first. What? I have something to take care of. I have to resolve something with Kay. I'll be on the next flight. No. I want to wait for you. Giraffe, take her to the airport quickly. Let go. I will wait for you. I'll see you later. Honey. Okay, go. Where did ahjussi go? What are you going to do? What? Are you going back to NIS? I don't know. I think I'll stay here for the time being, tidy up my things, and think this through again. No matter what you do, don't leave without saying anything. I don't want to let you go like that again. Okay. Is it? all finished now? Didn't you say there was someone you needed to take revenge on? That's right. That's why I became an undercover agent. But by living for the sake of revenge, I've realized, one day, that I had changed. I had turned into that person whom I hated so much. Have you found that person? Yes, he's already dead. He's dead? What a relief. I still thought that you? Nothing. I'll stop saying these things now. - Wait a second. - Why? You haven't eaten all day, have you? You have to eat something. Here. How is it? It's not tasty, is it? It's not that. Being able to sit here with you smiling face to face? It just doesn't feel real. Me too. I'm grateful that you're alive. But you should put more pakchi* in this. (*Thai word for 'cilantro') What? It tastes awful. Ji Woo. Kay. Where are you? You still have not left? The data you took with you was false. You shouldn't be... I thought you wouldn't be? Come out. If you come on your own, then I'll give you the data myself. No, I don't need it anymore. Really? If you don't come, then I'll come to you. Aren't you the one who really understands me? A person who betrays the group? will have to sacrifice something in return. Even if you go into hiding, your family, your friends... The people who are important to you... I'll find them all, one by one... and I'll kill them. Until you show yourself. Soo Hyun. Sleep. When did you come? A while ago. Ji Woo's inside. Where are you going? You're going to see Mao, aren't you? It turns out running away won't solve anything. Why? You've won. Cheongbang has been destroyed. All that remains is for things to go back to how they were. If you go to him now, then either one of you will die. No matter who it is, you'll lose. One way or another, he will end up finding me. Before that, you, mother and maybe even Ji Woo? might end up getting hurt because of me. It can't just end like this. I have to cut this evil bond with my bare hands. Ahjussi died while saving your life. Don't let his death be in vain. Hey, Lee Soo Hyun. Don't go, you jerk! Soo Hyun, don't go! Don't go! Don't go! Go back. I'll take the boss away. If you don't go back now, you'll die at my hands. Min Gi, are you all right? Myoung Jae, help me get an exact location quickly. Kay! Who are you? Are you my son? Or are you the traitor? Answer, Kay! My name is not Kay! If you were hiding your identity simply for the sake of an investigation, then you could never have deceived me. Mao, you've lost. Why have you saved my life so many times? Every time you had that look in your eyes. That sense of loyalty. What was it? It was only a momentary mistake that I made after losing my memory. Thanks to that, I was able to completely deceive you. Wrong. At that time, Kay, you were real. Perhaps you don't want to admit it. That was the real you, Kay! Shut up! This is for betraying our group. And this is for betraying my trust. Where did you get that watch? Why do you have that watch? It was my father's. The person you killed when I was born. My father! You want to know why I was so loyal to you like a dog? Because I wanted revenge. You killed my father, and you killed my mother in front of me when I was young. That's why I wanted to finish you off by myself. So it's you. You were Lee Dong Jo's son. What? That... was the first time I killed someone. Following Sir Jang's orders, I planted a bomb in a spy's car. I only found out later... that the target of my first assignment was... a friend more precious than one's own brother, Lee Dong Jo. Shut up! Who is your friend? This is the watch that I gave to him as a memory of our friendship. Stop lying or I'll kill you! If you don't believe me, then I'll show you. Don't move! The invincible Mao... is actually begging me to spare his life by using such a lame excuse? Do you want to live that much? What is your name? Your real name? What are you doing? Let go! Well, it doesn't matter anymore. Because you were my son, Kay. I want to rest now, Kay. Shall we start to look into it now? Yes, Overseas Team 1 should take charge of it. Team Leader Kang. Wow, this is my style. Very peaceful! You are right that it's peaceful here. But there's a lot of work. Sunbae, what do you want me to do with these? Although the process of our work is tedious, the objective is simple. Amongst the hundreds of thousands of data, to find that one piece of useful information. Sunbae. Sunbae-nim. Call me Team Leader from now on. Team Leader Gu, let's go. Confirm Monitor 1. [note: Ji Woo is reading Michael Ende's "The Neverending Story"] Is Jae Woo awake? Awake? My Jae Woo, you're so adorable! - Sorry. - Why have you just come? I had a last-minute meeting. - Let's go to daddy. - How has my Jae Woo been? So adorable. Where did she go? Has work been good lately? So-so. I draw then I worry. And then I go back to drawing. That's my life. Have you prepared for your overseas studies? Yes, I'll prepare this year, and go next year. Where are you going? Paris. Wow, Paris. What a great place. He's not like your usual bad guy. Welcome. I heard that you applied for another black mission in another region. You think I will change the person in charge because of that? Where is it? I'll chase you to the ends of the earth. Is Jae Woo growing well? Hurry up. What location is it? Rascal, for how long are you going to live as a dead man like this? I'm leaving. My next mission is at a paradise for spies. Paris?

Until the boy finally figured out the true meaning of himself. Nightfall... All things become stained red. There beyond that hill, approaches a silhouette... of a dog that I raised or a wolf ready to harm me. A time when that is indistinguishable. It is the time when both good and evil can only be red.
