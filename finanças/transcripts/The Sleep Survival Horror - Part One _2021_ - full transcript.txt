Look outside, there's no one out there. True story. - About time. - Untrue story, spooky... - Pizza's here! - Ooh, pizza! You know what I'm saying, though? - Hi, thank you. - Not really, I guess... How is there not - one kid who comes to the door. - One second... So excited for pizza! No payment needed... - It's 30 minutes late. - No one's really in the mood. Look, I'm telling you, man, there's some weird shit going on. - Sweet. - I know. - Have a good night! - Weird shit for weeks! I know, right? There are zero trick-or-treaters outside. - Pizza's free! - What happened to fun, - like when we were kids? I mean... - Come eat! Come eat! when we all went trick-or-treating, - you know? - We're not kids anymore. Yeah, I know we're not kids anymore., man, but... - Move, move.... - I agree with Brandon. Everything used to be more fun back in the day. - Fuck yeah. - What day? The fucking day. You know what I mean. Now, things that are supposed to be fun aren't even fun anymore. Seriously. Like movies... - They're all so damn serious. - Right? I mean, look at this, you can't even tell what holiday it is. - Not true, we got a cake. - It's Halloween! It's pretty good cake, too. It's not that good, I've had better. - When did things change? - Thanks mom! When did people stop playing outside - and showing up to events? - Uh, coronavirus? When we got old. Hey, speak for yourself! I miss the Eighties. You weren't even alive in the real Eighties. So I can still miss it, can't I? You know, every era - had a feel to it. - True. The Eighties were the Eighties. - The Nineties were the Nineties. - Love the Nineties. But after the 2000s. What? What era are we in now? Cell phones, Facebook and Xanax. This era sucks, what the fuck happened? Yeah... 9-11. - Hmm. - This. I seriously can't believe this. Why do people keep shooting people? Like, what the fuck? I hate guns. I think they should be fucking banned. - They should. - Like, what are you going to do with an AK-47? Its sole purpose is to kill people. I mean, you can't just ban guns. They have so many different uses like sport and game. - True. - Game? Really? An AK motherfucking 47, its sole purpose is to kill human beings. And don't tell me otherwise! I wasn't specifically referring to an AK-47, but okay... Like, imagine... actually killing someone... Do you think you could actually kill someone? For real? Like, imagine what it would take... Imagine seeing someone's life leave them in front of you because of what you did... It's fucked up, man. Yeah... It's real fucked up, I couldn't do it. Yeah, neither could I. Jack? Whoa, don't ask me like a bullshit loaded question like that. No, I mean, seriously, you can kill someone with a butter knife. - I mean, honestly. - Butter knife? If someone's coming at me, bro... Come at me, bro. They're going to get dealt with. Boom! - Oh! - Seriously, guys! We're desensitized. You watch this shit on TV... It's not "real." Dead body in a movie, dead body in a street. Come on, Monica. It changes when it's someone you know. it has nothing to do with you until it has something to do with you. Stay asleep. Do nothing. Watch what happens to your life. Jesus. Happy Halloween. What do you do about it, Monica, huh? Alright, alright, you guys. There's so much fucked up shit that happens in the world every day, right? Yup. I mean, there's nothing we can actually do about it if you really honestly look at it. I know... That's why we have fucking police and shit. Police are busy handling crime. - They're not... - Handling crime? feeding the poor and picking up trash and shit. - They're busy killing Black people. - Are we being real right now? Because I can get real. Oh boy... It sounds fucked up, but I have my own problems to worry about. I can't feed bums on the street, I can barely pay my own fucking rent. - Wow! - Really? Really John. - That's true though! - So true. I'm not trying to be an asshole or anything. Tell me I'm the only one in the room who thinks this? Tell me. Right? I mean, shit, if I'm being really real. There have been starving kids in Africa since before I was born. So like, if they're still starving, they must not be really starving or they'd be dead. - Dude! - I'm just fucking saying. - Oh my god... - If the greatest minds haven't been able to solve the problem in all these years what the fuck can I do? - John! - He's right! - Think about it! - How am I supposed to pick up all this trash on the beach? - Yeah! - If people just keep putting it there. I have a life. I won't be truly living if all I'm doing is picking up trash. Exactly, I hate donating blood. I can't stand blood. Why kill myself for someone else? Bet you'd kill yourself for me, right? Fuck yeah, bitch, of course. Come on. All these problems in the world, I live halfway across the planet, I can't do jack shit. See, that's why I want to be rich so I can donate to things. - Aw, you wanna' be rich. - I agree with Luna, people come up with new solutions all the time. Yeah, while you two are getting rich, people are going to die. Why is the world so fucked up, though? Has anyone actually thought about it? Like, why would God do that? It's the devil. - True story. - It's not the fucking devil. - All right. What then? - Could be. You have no idea who runs the media and governments. - Oh fuck off. - The governments? Who do you think controls the news telling you it's all bad? Come on. And the economy? Making us stressed, anxious and depressed so they can sell us drugs and make shit tons of money off? Oh, Monica, chill! Just saying Britney, there is some fucked up, sinister shit going on in this world that no one talks about because they do... What shit? Jack! Shh! What? You know, every mass shooter was on some sort of mind drug, right? - What? - Stop! The news never talks about that. Any celebrity they want to terminate... Suicide... OD... It's the new "natural" cause. And they told me I had ADHD when I was nine. - Can't imagine why. - Wanted to end my creativity. Fuck you! I was nine! I'm supposed to be hyper at nine. Okay. How do you even know all this? I've researched a fuck ton online. Oh, all that fake news, conspiracy shit. You need to know how to do proper research. It's right there. Okay, show me. Okay. All right. All right. You guys, please, no, can we stop with the fucking conspiracy shit! Jack, come on! - Jack, dude! - Please, you guys! You guys? The world is fucked, okay? And we're not going to be able to do jack shit about it. So let's just enjoy our lives. - Let's! - Okay? Right? Why, I don't even... Why the fuck are you watching this shit? Seriously. - Thank you! - Let's go do something fun. Like what? I don't know. Brandon, what do we do as kids? You're the one complaining. Ideas? I don't know, I guess, talk to each other more? - or play catch. - Yeah, no, that's great! - Spin the bottle. - Play catch! I talk to a lot of people now more than ever on social media, so I don't know what you're talking about. - I can't do social media. - You know, I kind of lost touch with all my friends on social. I see everything they do, but... When we talk, it's kind of superficial. I guess... - I don't think so. - Another reason why the world is so fucked. Computers, phones, social media - making everyone fucking antisocial. - Alright. Alright! - Monica, come on. - Get off then. Knock it off! Can we just fucking look each other in the face and fucking fact on each other? We are talking to each other. I need some water. You're an asshole, John. Yes, but I'll always be yours. - Go talk to her. - Change your sexual preference. Suck my dick. Anytime, anywhere. Go! Okay, ya'll, listen... This is my fucking house. And if I say we're talking to each other, we're gonna' fucking talk to each other. Monica! Oh, Jesus! Fine. What do you want to talk about? - Hey. - Hey. - Let's talk about horror movies. - I don't know why I'm so thirsty. Yeah, me too. You know... All that talk in there made me realize something... Oh yeah. Yeah. They're all jump scares... That we don't really talk enough... What do you mean we don't talk enough? I guess I don't mean like talk enough, I guess... You know, talk about things that we really... should talk about... Well, what things do you want to talk about? Is anyone feeling a little strange? Yeah, kinda'... I'm feeling tired... What's in this drink? I don't know, but it is strong. It tastes like Vodka... You know, since your grandma, um... things have been different... Yeah, it's been um... I know. I'm sorry. What?

That's shocking the body and administering psychiatric medications make the brain impressionable. And in this vulnerable state, we can impress deep within the all-powerful mind commands. And not just buy this magazine or eat this food, but commands which only the brain and its infinite potential can grant. On a moment's notice, through triggers on a television, a computer, a game, a phone, even music... we can create subjects who will act upon our every command without fear, without remorse. Subjects who will go beyond our public trials. But coming true weapons of mass destruction that we can use in lands foreign or domestic... Now mental disorders have been used to prepare the world with medication. We're ready for the next step. We've begun tests of greater magnitude. - What the fuck? - Was that shooting today? Fuck, man. I don't know what kind of fucked up shit is going on here, but count me the fuck out. Let's get out of here. Dude, is that a real shotgun? I don't know.

When I was a young boy, I was deathly afraid of the monsters in my closet and under my bed. My mother was a nurse at a local asylum, so... She used to treat me... Every Friday night, she would tie me up, and make me watch horror films and footage of the horrors of society... as she listened to Marion Harris, and doing her crossword puzzles and her board games. Suppose I do have to thank her, though. Because in the end, the treatment worked. I wasn't scared anymore. I was so accustomed to fear, it became part of me. And it will become part of you too... Enjoy the experiment. That's where you're meant to go, your family and your friends and such are in there. Wait, what? He says I'm not supposed to kill you. I'm not supposed to kill you. Fuck. Riley!

It's about an hour and a half until we're through... And at that point, If you haven't made it through two more houses, you will immediately be killed. Oh yes. Now my journals will help ease you in and to understand All you have to do now is choose another house.

We have to be fucking discreet. - No, hey! - She needs this, I don't know why she fucking needs it, but she fucking needs it. Either way, It doesn't matter. Yelling her name like a walking target is going to get us all fucking killed. He said we had ten minutes. - It's only been two or three max. - I don't care. No, hey, we're going to find her, and we're going to get out of here. But we have to be fucking intelligent about this. Intelligent about what, - about what? - About whatever the fuck this is! Singulas domus supernaturale visione vides. This is so fucked. We have to fucking deal with it, okay? I know none of this makes sense. So the fuck what? The only explanation is that there is no explanation, and that's good enough for me. We're fucking surviving. Journal 304. - Shit. - What the fuck. From the hypnotic effects of modern medications. We no longer need to administer electric shocks to gain compliance. The drugs act as a shock in themselves. We only have to give the commands and they'll follow. Many subjects have undergone these tests to great success all over the country. Oh, fuck. The results are... sufficient... which leads us to our latest experiment. - Mom. - As you can see, I have entered the area, educated the public and convinced them onto the medication. Mom... Now we use them how we see fit. And that was just the beginning. One by one, they moved to influence one another, spreading the drug amongst themselves, rendering the town into a mass, hypnotic state. No fucking way. - These motherfuckers... - No. - No, that's not... - We have to find Luna. How's that possible? They can't do that. They can't do that! Yes, they fucking can. This shit isn't real, we just saw the whole fucking town! I know what we just saw! I'm telling you it's real! It's what LSD was developed for with MKUltra in the 1950s. - Basic mind control. - MKUltra? Bullshit! We need to get Luna, we find her and we get the fuck out of here - Now! - How are we supposed to do that? We're not supposed to do that. You think they're going to fucking let us leave, huh? - After seeing that shit?! - We'll figure something out! Hey, Brandon's right. We have to figure a way out. It's the only fucking way. I'm fucking going. Brandon. Fuck this. Fuck... Fucking dammit. Luna.... Help! Help. Help me. Help me! Luna!! Help me!! Luna! Help me! Luna! Help!

That gives you 35 minutes. Where is he? He's in there. He's right there. Go get him. Go get him. Yeah, get him. He's yours. Unleash it, find it inside you... Do it, Luna. Do it... Go go! Brandon! Luna... Luna! Journal 289. I finally begun to research the technology for myself, and its power is remarkable. It seems to be some sort of engine... It has the power to make what's in your mind manifest. - How far does that go? - This way... I'll continue to do more tests... - Wrong way... - What if the subject is hallucinating, or under hypnosis... Brandon! - Luna! Over here... - They'd like to know. Luna! ...Luna... It's abuela. It's grandma! Luna... Luna... It's abuela... It's grandma... Over here, mijita. Over here. Brandon is over here. Luna! Help me! Brandon! Aqui... Aqui... Come... here... I need you! Good... Keep going... Down the stairs... Mijita... I want to show you... We need to show you! Soon you'll be one of us... Luna... You are going to die... Please... Mary? You, you know me. They killed my baby. - They killed my baby. - You'll be here soon... Kill! Derek. Go! Mr. Peterson? Join us... This way... Have a seat. Where's Luna? He appreciates what you and your friends have accomplished. We didn't expect you to get this far. Where are my friends? Luna is alive and fine for now. You have many questions. Why are you doing this, you fucks! You have many questions... Why?! Answer me! What the fuck is wrong with you?! Where's Luna?! Where are my friends?! Say something! Answer me, God damn it! Ahh, you son of a bitch... Fuck you!! Oh, fuck! You need to drink. He likes you. Then let us go! He can't do that. This is greater than any of us. Even now, this is part of the experiment. He suggests you hurry. You still might be able to make it out alive. Luna is in the house. She's not far. Okay. Best of luck. Journal 310. The key experiment. We've administered the drug and installed the commands in the young adults... Subjects B. Triggers and phrases will bring them into hallucinated realities where they'll unknowingly follow the commands. If you take off your weapon you get an extreme migraine and die in 60 seconds. You see your family and friends killing you. You see each house in my supernatural vision. Kill them. You will commit mass murder. Subjects A... ...the families that we've been controlling for the past few weeks have been released from our control to become trial victims. They're given only two commands. One... not to leave the house. Two... To agree to the imaginings of Subjects B. This shows the power of the mind Somehow Subjects A respond to the fabricated rules of Subjects B without being told what those rules are... Telepathic communication. Subjects B are weapons... killing their loved ones without remorse. Death will act as a trigger, reinforcing the commands. If they try to resist, they will attack themselves, however they see most fitting. Now, I believe that we can achieve our aims with drugs, hypnotic commands, and triggers alone... However, many of my colleagues in The Association believe our government sponsors have a point in the usage of The Technology. I consider it to be overkill. Why expend that much force if you don't have to? Although, it is quite effective. Britney run! Subjects A have fully become the monsters Subjects B believed them to be. Come on!! We will see which method is best to achieve our goals. Brandon! Brandon, come on! Brandon! - Yes! Come to me... - Luna! Brandon! Luna! Go.... Let the demon take you. Just like my baby... - Let the demon take you... - Brandon! Let the demon take you... This way Luna... Luna, I'm over here! Help me! Brandon, do it, kill them. Good... Very good... It's your parents... Hey son... I can't take it anymore. We know, baby. It'll be over soon. Make it stop... She's coming to kill you, your mother, me... You need to stop her. End her life. She doesn't love you. She has betrayed you. She's coming to get you. Kill her first. Kill her first. Kill her, kill her. It's in your hands... Brandon! This way... Kill... This way... Luna... You'll be dead soon... Luna... You'll be dead soon... Brandon! Brandon! Luna! Luna! Come here... Time to kill! Let me take over your mind. - No! Ah! Ahh! - Your mind is mine. I own you! Become me. Luna!! Where are you Luna?! Luna!! Where are you Luna?! Luna!! Come out, you fucking bitch, come here!! Luna!! Kill. - Kill! - Let go. Kill Brandon. No... Please. Don't do this. Kill Brandon. - Please! Ah! - There we go... Kill him! - Stupid girl... - Stop, please! Killing is your nature. No! - You must kill him. - Please... No! - You have to kill. - Let go. Let go...

Luna. - Pick up the glass. - This isn't real. They want us to kill each other. - Kill him with it... - They gave us pills, okay? We're hallucinating all of this. Remember what they...

What are you doing?! Stop. Luna, please. Luna. Look at me please, Luna. You must kill him. You have to kill. Stop! Ah. Stop. Brandon help me! - Luna. They gave us commands. - End his life. Kill him.

No Luna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You like hitting girls? - I'm sorry... Hmm? - No, no. - No! No! Brandon! Flashlight... Flashlight! You can't escape! Don't even think about it. Luna! Jesus. Take the flashlight. Don't stop... Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Your mind is mine. Brandon. No! - I own you. - Brandon! Please stop! No. No. - Brandon!! - Fuck! Luna. Oh god! Luna. No. Hey, come on.

Work, you piece of shit. I didn't get to finish... Don't... Move... They did this to all of us. Don't speak. I can't think. I can't think. I'm sorry I killed your friends. I don't... I have no control, sometimes. My psychiatrists knocked a couple of screws loose. Cebem maha munstro! Fuck. You know, psychiatry began with torture. Not many people know that. The original torture was used to rid people of evil spirits. They were trying to get the evil spirits out, but not in the way they said they were. Copsom darei! Come on!! They wanted to use the evil spirits. They were trying to rile them up and to make them angry to even turn someone into an evil spirit... A witch. Psychiatry was never meant for healing. They went from torture devices, to ice pick lobotomies, to electric shock to pills. To me... their greatest achievement. I don't feel healed. Hitler used them for Nazi work. Well, I will not be used! Perperiem... Ahh!! God damn it! These things never work when you need them to! Wait, what? Where is it? He says this thing can be the new atom bomb. Use it. No. Destroy it. Destroy it. Ah! No, it's dangerous. Use it. I said, use it. You could use it on everyone. You could kill everyone. No, god... Shock! Shock her again. Oh shit. Fuck! Come on, come on, Luna. - Strap her down. - Where do we go? Drag her in. There's no door. Sedate her! You can't do this to me, you can't do this... - It's okay... - I'm a human being. No, no more. - Shock her. Shock. - Where's the exit? Oh, fuck. It's an elevator! Let's go. Come on, come on. Oh shit! - Again! Again! - Help me! You won't get away with this. Come on, come on. Oh fuck. - Take the pills. - No. No! Come on. You will become death. - No, I don't want to. Please. - No! No. No. Leads... You're amazing, Lily. You are powerful! You are amazing! This is necessary... I love you, Lily... You're my greatest experiment. You will be the strongest of them all. You're a weapon of mass destruction. Kill! No... Kill them all. What's happening? Run. Run! Oh, shit. - Kill them. - Run! Go. Go. I won't let you get away. I won't let you get away with this. Ahh! - What have you done to me?! - We gotta' go! What have you done?! You're a killer. Go. - Run, run! - What have you done to me?! What have you done? You're a weapon of mass destruction. - What have you done to me?! - Kill! Kill! Ahh!! What have you done?! Lily!! Shock. Shock her again. Again. Again! - I said, what, have you done?! - No! Please! Please!! Please stop! You crazy bitch! Let's go! Come, get up! Come on, let's go! Go. What have you done to me?! Ahh! What have you done to me?! I said, what have you done to me?! What have you doing to me?! Congratulations. You three have survived. So what you will do is take one a day for seven days and it'll wean you off the medication we gave you earlier. I suggest you start now. Come on. Come on, take them. Good. Brandon, let's go. Haha, good... Good, Monica. You've all provided us with very useful information. Your contributions will not go unacknowledged. Thank you so much for the great work, we really appreciate it. The Association appreciates it. Farewell, until we meet again. Come on. Another mass murder late last night, - A mass murder last night... - more than 30 bodies were discovered early this morning in the middle of the street and within their homes. Three armed assailants... Brandon Williams, Luna Valdez and Monica Cohen... remain fugitives... Wanted for the mass murder of their neighbors and their families... More on the shooting at nine. When we come back, A major breakthrough in the field of mental health. The FDA has just approved a revolutionary new drug... Paxoloft SR, marketed as an honest-to-goodness cure for anxiety and depression. Having been put through rigorous clinical trials they're set to begin mass production next week. When we come back, experts from the Global Psychiatric Association will discuss what this means for the field of mental health. This program is sponsored by Paxoloft SR... the only medication clinically proven to help anxiety disorders and depression. Do you ever feel depressed for no reason?
