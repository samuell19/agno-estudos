There's a little town up Highway One. Past the mountains and the seals... ...called Cambria. A place of beauty, where everyone stays the same. Girls unchanged. Pretentious in their desires. Ugh, I don't understand what I'm gonna do with my hair. You're really annoying me because you keep talking about your hair all the time. You're really annoying me, because you're not putting a balloon up. Oh, okay, can you stop? Can you stop? Can you just maybe move and do something. Um, where do you want this? On the ceiling where a disco ball goes. There's a nail right there. I mean, I don't understand why no one can see it. It is plain as day. Please, just put it up here. Just there. To the left. Building our celebration. A new year. You know, the next step in your career. Oh, my God, Sasha, not that window, the window over there! Thank you. What was the theme? New Year, 1969 to 1970. I love dress-up parties. Why didn't you tell me? I really thought I did. Hey. Hi, hi, I'm Alex. Maria. What are you doing? Can you not do that, please? Releasing our weariness and ennui. Some people, searching, adventurous souls, move away. Hey, how you doing? Five minutes, okay? Okay. Many of us, the lost, stay. We do sometimes attract those from foreign lands. But that's where I knew her. Nina. And those years, the years after she left, they blended together. Not for her. But for me. You're acting really dramatic about this. No, I'm not. You didn't tell me it was a fucking dress-up party. Everyone looks amazing. I promise that I told you. You look amazing too. I literally came from work. Dem, Dem, Dem, guess what we are? Guess our outfit. I don't know. Astronaut and star. My bright and shining star. Isn't it perfect? It's like David Bowie, like "Star man." Can I have a hit of that? I can ask Anna. I don't know her. I know her, and she's really sweet, okay? Okay. Hi, Anna! It's Ah-na, but yeah, hi. Okay, I'm so sorry. It's fine. This is my friend Natasha. Hi. Hi. Is there any way you'd let her borrow something from your closet? I'm sorry. Sure, yeah. It's right there at the end of the hall. You can take whatever you need. Thank you so much. Yeah. I can't believe I showed up at this party in that outfit. I'm telling you, you always look good. I feel like I showed up naked. Shh! Sorry. It's a little peasanty. Yeah, but in a sexy way. Okay. Does it not go? It goes, it goes. What do you think? It's beautiful. It's not... right. I just really want Dem to like it. Yeah. Natasha, you know he likes you in anything. That's not true. Looks better in everything. Baby, that's it. Are you kidding me? I don't really feel like myself, and that feels good. Thank you. Yay! Can I have another shot? Is that... is that okay? Why are you asking me? I'm sorry, I just wanted to make sure that it's okay. Okay. Three, two, one. I got it first! - Whoo! - Whoo! This is gonna get me really fucked up tonight. I don't know anyone here. I was in this Uber, and I was going to my American investor's house for his New Year's Eve party, because we're launching in Italy tomorrow. Launching what? Oh, it's my new app. Um, it's called Following. Do you know it? No shit. Wow! Yes. Yeah. You made... you... That was me. Okay, this is unreal. Wait, wait, this is um... Yes. ...remind me what it does. It just tracks, it tracks people. - Maria. - Say it one more time. M-Maria. M-Maria. Yes. Yes, like, uh, "West Side Story." Oh. What? Well, she is... I look for her. She's right over there. Yeah. With the black hair. - Yes. - I'm Paulie, by the way. Whose party is this? Um, this is, um, whose party is... Oh, this is you, uh, Sasha's sister's party. It's my sister's. Cool, Sasha. Alex. Yeah, meet Maria. - It's new. - Yeah, it's fine. It's gonna be launched, like, in the next couple of weeks. - Oh, wow. - Um... Hey. Hey. You want vodka? No thanks. Vodka? Yeah. We like vodka. Vodka? Mm-hmm. Mm. Youngest app creator ever. He's funny. How do you say "giraffe" in Russian? Like, in Russian language, or...? Not, like, in Russian. Like, in a Russian accent. Oh. Giraffe. Giraffe. Oh, my God, excuse me, is that my vape? Yeah. You know cucumber flavor is discontinued. I thought... Oh, my God! I only have three pods! I thought it was mint that you... That's... no, stop taking my shit! Sorry. Maria! Happy New Year! Are you having fun? 'Cause we are. Oh, my God, I'm so happy everyone went with the theme. We all look so fabulous. Wait. Wait, I forget what the theme was. Is it "Deep Throat"? Ew, no that's absolutely disgusting. This place looks amazing. I know, right? It's my parents' little love cabin. Maria helped me decorate, you guys. Wow, really nice, Maria. Oh, my God, how rude of me. Um, Maria, this is Nikolai. He works with my dad. Oh. Hey. You can call me Nick, for short. He's from the Far East. Wow. And by Far East, I mean Russia, obviously. Where in Russia? Siberia. Oh. And you live here now? Well, I, uh... He works for my dad, like I said. I visit. Work tree. Oh, that explains why I haven't seen you. I know everyone in Cambria. Yeah, Maria and I used to be, like, really close in high school. Oh, my God. Maria. Guess who's coming. Who? Guess. Who? No seriously, guess. I don't know. Nina. Oh, I didn't, I didn't know she was... Yeah, I know. Me neither. But I mean, you know her. It's all very mysterious. Wait, isn't that the girl from your grade, that actress who, like, moved to New York? Yeah. Yeah. She was part of our group in high school. Um, Maria and her were, like, inseparable. But then she, like, went off to New York, and we haven't heard from her since. It's been, like, what? 10 years? And then, all of a sudden, boom. She's back, out of nowhere. I mean, come on, there must be something up, right? Or maybe nothing's up, and maybe she's, maybe she just wanted to come home. Did I ask for your opinion? No. I apologize for Andrei, you guys. He struggles with social cues. Uh, actually... Anyway, so as I was saying, it's really crazy that she's back. She hates Cambria, so... I'm sorry, where did you say you went to school again? Oh, he went to the same high school as us. He's just, like, way older. But he knew about us. I mean, everyone did. Everyone knew about our little group, right? Yeah. Yeah. Right. Oh, my God. Guys, let's go to the hot tub. Yeah! I think it's warm. Let's go. Come on. Alright. Race you there! Hey, wait for me! Do you like my outfit? Yeah. I changed. It's excellent. It's stolen. No, it was a gift. It was a gift from Anna, who I don't know at all. Break it, you buy it. I like this. You can have it. That's mine. I can, huh? Amazing. Do I look like I'm in a Renaissance fair? Just a little bit. Yeah? Yeah. Kind of cool though. What about this? Fantastic. Okay with it? These fucking jewels keep falling off my fucking vape. Oh, shit. Mm-hmm. Do you want me to get you a couple of new ones? No. We're at a party. Alright, okay. Maybe for your birthday or something? God. You want to get me stick-on jewels for my birthday? I thought they were important to you. That's disgusting. Jesus. Alright, you don't have to give me such attitude. Hey, give me some of that. Hi, guys. What's wrong with you? I think Pedro's broken up with me. What, out of nowhere? Maybe it was just an argument or something, but I'm really depressed. Uh-huh. Um, oh sorry, I don't think y'all have met. This is Maria. This is Ira. Hey. Hey. Is she okay? I am great. Mm. Sorry. I just need... Um, how do you guys know one another? Oh, this is a funny story. I met Ira when I was visiting that Finnish guy in London last summer. The one I was fucking. Remember him? God, he was so hot. You fucked him? Yes, I fucked him. Are you serious? It's none of your business. Jesus. Yeah. Pedro was going to meet me in San Francisco, but now... Oh. So, you're like a big Tony Bennett fan? Yeah. Yes. He's very big star in Russia. God, heartbreak, am I right? God, it's the absolute worst. But you would never do that to me, would you, Flushie? Never. Never. Nina! Oh, my God, you're here! Come in, come in! Come on! Here. Thanks. You haven't changed a bit. Still as precocious as ever. So, you do remember me. Of course I do. You're Anna's little sister. Oh, God, I idolized you. Nina, I idolized you. I worshipped all three of you, actually. Anna, Nina, Maria. You were the inseparable three. I guess we used to be. You haven't been back in years. Unless my sister lies to me. No, she didn't lie to you. This is my boyfriend Alex! Hi. Hi. Nina. Nice to meet you. You too. He's my professor at school. Isn't that sweet? So, um, Nina, Anna, Maria, they were best friends in high school. Oh. Nina lives in NYC now. Oh wow, okay, I-I studied at Columbia. Oh, really? So yeah, yeah. I loved it there. Hey is... is Maria here? Oh, my gosh, she's outside, and she's gonna be so happy to see you. Oh, this is Paulie. - Hey. - Hi, Nina. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Do you want a drink? Yes. Cool. She's so smart. She speaks like so many languages. But they say that Elvis is the king. I say Bennett. Tsar. What's up? You like Paulie. What? No, no, no. I mean, she's fascinating, but no, no. It just was... The conversation was gre... I mean, she's like, it's just funny, 'cause I was listening to a podcast about, um, like the tech boom and the app development stuff in Silicon Valley, um... No, you've been with her all night. What? No, not all night. We just got here. The party just... just started. Thinks he's so superior, doesn't he? Um, hey, could you do... Professor Livingston, please. Yeah. Could you, uh, could you ask them to go? Why? Just another... They're my friends. Okay. I'm sorry, but I just... It's just that ABBA over there is, um, in my astronomy class. It feels a little bit weird, you know? I'm in your astronomy class. Could you just talk to them? I'll talk to them. Can you guys please leave? We just got here. You're making Alex uncomfortable. Oh, we're making Alex uncomfortable? What are you supposed to be, anyway? Uh, we're ABBA, okay? Minus Bjorn. Isn't it obvious? Maybe you should ask your boyfriend. They're from his generation. Wait, wait, we have to... Are you seriously dating Professor Livingston? Yeah, it's been three months, so... Three months? Why did you keep that a secret? It's not a secret. Then what is it, Sasha? It's a personal relationship. Okay, right. Can you just leave? At least to another room. - We gotta go find Bjorn anyway. - I'm not leaving. - No, no, no, no, no. We gotta go find Bjorn anyway. - I'm fully not leaving. Please, let's... Let's just leave. Fine, I think I saw him on the balcony. We can leave. That's fine. Let's go to another room. It's all good. Bye, Sasha. Seriously. Can I ask you a question? Okay. Do you really like Natasha? No, I really like... myself. Well... she's really in love with you. So are you. What makes you say that? Look, it's not a competition. It's totally a competition. Okay, then, I don't know. Where's Natasha right now? Taking a nap. A nap? Yeah, a nap. I don't know what that means. But I do know that I'm here right now. Do you like her dress? She changed for you. Look, I'm... But I'm just me. Does that make sense? I really don't want to have this conversation right now. Well, it seems to me like you are in the best possible situation. Two beautiful girls are in love with you. Okay. Not that I'm beautiful. Did I say that? I'm sorry about that. Natasha's beautiful. I'm average. Sorry, lady. Hi, Dem. Long time no see. Nina? Fuck, you look different. Not really. Well, what are you doing here? I thought you live in New York. I do, but I'm back. Like, how long are you here for? Uh, you two know each other? Yeah, from a long time ago. He knows her. Who? That girl. In what way knows her? I don't know, but it can't be good. Good for you or good for me? Wait. Neither. They have history. Hm. You ripped my dress. No, that's just the dress. Oh. So, I'm trying to really decide between like, this one which is more heads hot-y, and, like, this one that's, like, more model-y. 'Cause you know, like, I'm a commercial actress. I do kind of prefer that one. Why do you prefer that one? Just because... Why not this one? Do you not like this one? No, no, no, no, no, I do like it. No, you're putting... No, but why do you not like this one? Now I don't... This is from like a very, very, like, famous photographer right now, and I paid a lot of money to get these done. So, I just don't understand like, why. I just... I just wanna... Now I'm really confused. Now I-I don't which one. You look good in all of them. Why are you confused? It's a simple question. Because you look good in all of them. I asked you to tell me which heads hot you prefer. Now I feel trapped. Now you're making me feel like I'm trapped. You feel trapped? You're not an animal. Like, come on, like stop victimizing yourself. I'm not. Don't touch my phone! I asked your opinion, I didn't ask you to swipe on my phone. I'm gonna swipe. Alright, alright, alright. Go to the third one then, okay? That's the third one. No, that's the second one. No. Whatever I do, I can't cry. My face is like a statue. Just frozen. My eyes are like... two dead bulbs in these dry, dry sockets. I feel emotion, but I can't produce a single tear. Teach me how to cry. You're the best crier I've ever seen. I don't know how to. I don't know how. Natasha... why are you crying? He doesn't love me. He doesn't love you. He only loves himself. And her. Who? Nina. Oh. Her. Yes, that makes it even worse. Natasha. The way the tears leave your eyes... it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Please, teach me how to cry! Have you seen a sewing kit? You ripped my dress. It was an accident. Well actually, it's not even my dress. It's Anna's dress. It doesn't matter. Anna has 100 different dresses. It does matter, Martha. It doesn't matter! Teach me how to cry! I want to cry! Oh, sorry. That's okay. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I don't know what's with all the crying tonight. I gave my friend Natasha some shrooms, and she is like so fucked up. It was like a big mistake. I'm not crying. Okay. Do you want some? I mean, they might make you feel better. No, I don't do drugs. Okay. I'm Dem, by the way. Ira. You know what is funny? Everyone here has Russian name. Huh? Yeah? Yeah, but they are not Russian. Oh. No, well, Natasha... Anna... Daniel... Daniel? Daniel. Daniel's not a Russian name. Dan is very Russian. We are very proud of our... Dans. Dan, yes, Dan was good friend with, um, with Geoff. Geoff. Geoff, yeah. "Geff." Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Your name, you are very strong old Russian name. Yeah, Maria. Yeah, that I get. Daniel? You know. It's a long history. Okay. Mm. Hey. Hi. It's been so long. I didn't think you'd be here. Is that your boyfriend? What? Oh, no. I just met him. He's not from here. He's Russian actually. What? I know, it's weird. Do you want one? Oh, no. I stopped. Wow. How long have you been here? Since Christmas. Oh. I had no idea. No one did. Yeah, but I usually see everyone down at the shop. Your mom still comes in sometimes. You still work at the shop? Yeah. Hasn't it been since, like, high school? Yeah, um... I just had my 13-year anniversary, which is pretty sad, I know, but, um, I'm manager now. So, I guess I progressed somehow. Not like you, across the country. I didn't think you'd ever come back. How's New York? It's New York. Okay. That's not very enlightening. There's not much to say. Yeah. You were always like that. Like what? Oh, I don't know. Quiet. Repressed. Mysterious. I'm not mysterious. Oh, okay. How would you call yourself then? Inscrutable? You'd call yourself that? Maybe. That's worse. How are your parents? They're good. Around. Oh, guess what. What? They still have the boat. Oh. Good Time Nina. Hm. God, this town. Mm. Hey, are you still acting? God, you were so good in that play senior year. Um, what was it called again? I was just thinking about it the other day. "Sylvia"? Yeah, that's it. I played the dog. Yeah, you were fucking fantastic. I was terrible. What? No, you were amazing with all the physical... I mean, I can't even, obviously, but... you were great. We all knew you were gonna get out of here, follow your calling. I wish I could have been that brave. Hey. Oh, hi. Yeah, um... Nina, this is... Nick. Yeah. Nikolai. Wow. That is a firm handshake. Where on earth did you come from? Oh, it's a long story. I work for, um, Anna's father. For tree job. Mm. Oh. Am I, um, do I interrupt something or...? Oh, no. No. Well, do you want to go inside? Hm? Yeah. Sure. Okay. Okay. Was, um, nice meeting you. You too. When we first met, he was with someone else. This girl from Spain, 'cause that's where he's originally from. And he left her for me. So romantic. Anyway, she was, uh, um, and his family, well, he's from a really good family. He's this amazing architect slash conceptual artist, and he just built this sculpture in King's Cross, which is a station. Like Harry Potter. I fucking love Harry Potter. Yeah, I've got a picture. Do you want to see a picture? I'm okay. Honestly, it's spectacular. I bet. So, you guys broke up? I don't know. I mean, I got to California a week ago, and then, he stopped taking my calls. I sent him a million messages, and I can see he's read it, but nothing. I mean, why would he do this to me? I'm beautiful, I'm intelligent. What's wrong with me? Oh. Nothing. Anyway, we've been playing phone tag all night, and obviously there's a time difference, so... I don't know. What would you do? Should I keep calling him, or is that just desperate? What do you think, Demetrius? It's Dem. Sorry. I must have got Demetrius from Shakespeare or something. Do you want to know what I think? Yeah. Okay, so how long have you been together? Three months. Oh! I can't... When you know that that person's the one, you just know, do you know what I mean? I can tell that Peter is the one. I thought his name was Pedro. That's what I said. Okay. Do you think they can get up to leave? I'm really allergic to the smoke. Natasha... Get out. What? Come on. The time is now. We're leaving now. What time is now? Come on. Come on, you guys. It's the... we're done. No. What the fuck? What are you... No, we're not smoking. So, what were we talking about? Your boyfriend. Oh, right. I thought if I asked my friends to go, you'd pay more attention to me. Well... Basically, I just want my boyfriend back. Okay, um, yeah. Yeah, can we actually talk about that? Just, um, I wanted to... I wanted to... Did we agree to... To start using those words, the boyfriend-girlfriend thing? It's not a big deal, but I just want to sort of touch base about that, just see where you're at. I can't believe you would even question if you're my boyfriend. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not questioning. That's not... That's not what I said. I'm just saying like, people... it's like, uh, I don't know. People throw those words around, and I just... When I say that kind of thing... You know what? I'm thinking out loud, and this is so stupid, we shouldn't talk about... hey. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, I'm here with you, okay? I'm not going anywhere. Hey, hey... You've hurt my feelings. Okay. Okay, maybe I should go. No, don't go. No, I'm... I'm gonna go. I want you to go. It's not even about you, I should just go for me. No, I want you to go. Just... Okay. No, don't go. Come here. No. Actually, just go. You know, yeah, I'm gonna go. Because you're not my boyfriend. You can just go. Obviously. That was... I was like... I was like. And moreover, what is everyone doing having fun at this party? Why is it a New Year's party and everyone's smiling? I'm on holiday, and... I'm on holiday, and it's really bad. It's really bad, this party. I'm having a really bad holiday. It's a really bad holiday! No, of course I know. Yeah, I've been the one telling you this for months. I'm having a really bad holiday here. What is this place? Uh, I speak perfect Italian, thank you very much. No, I've been calling them all... Uh, I... I have to call you back. New Year's, why is everyone so happy? Why am I in the middle of nowhere on New Year's Eve? Where's my boyfriend? What is everyone saying? Did... did you just eat that fish? Yep. That... was amazing. Ew. Where's your boyfriend? He went home. Well, then I'd say he's not really your boyfriend then. No, he's just an adult, and he has a life. Why is that funny? 'Cause I don't have a life? Gross. God, I can't believe Nina actually came. I know. She looks amazing. Older, I guess, but I can't remember what she looked like, so... She looks way older. Yeah, well, I admire Nina. Why? 'Cause she got out of Cambria. We're so different, you and I. Why would you ever want to leave? We have everything here. Maybe I want more. Okay. You know, I'm so glad I could pull you away from exchanging fluids with Andrei for more than 10 seconds. Jesus, aggressive much? Also, that guy you were with, your "boyfriend", he's way too old for you. I don't know what's wrong with him. He's probably going through some sort of mid-life crisis. You should stay out of it. I just want to talk about my feelings with you. I do not want your opinion on anything. Yeah, well I am older than you, so I know better. Except we look the same age, so... Cheers. Oh, can you... can you help me with the beer? What would you think if Andrei and I had our wedding here? - What's your name? - I'm Andrei. What's your name? You're getting married? No, like, hypothetically, do you think this place could host a wedding? Maybe. Petra. Petra, like the Seven Wonders of the World. - Mm-hmm. - Cool, cool. - So... - Yeah? Doesn't Andrei look cute tonight? I have a girlfriend. He looks the same, but an astronaut. But he looks sweet, right? What is your problem? Is he too young for you or something? Jesus fucking Christ, Anna. What? Shit! Shit, shit, shit! God, let me help you. Fuck! Mm, ow. He's married, Anna. Alex, he's married. Can I have that Band-Aid? You know, somehow, you just managed to make it all about yourself, didn't you? I'm not sure what you want me to say. You got yourself into this mess. I'm trying to express my feelings! I'm fucking upset. Did you not know that he was married? Yeah. I forgot. Oh, come on, you forgot? When you love somebody... You don't love him. You don't know what love is. Look who's talking. What? I just wanted to get a beer. Okay. Get one. So mad at me. Do you want me to save you a spot in the Jacuzzi? Leave. Alright. Jesus. I missed you. You know, your mom used to stop by the store, and whenever I'd see her, she'd be like, "Nina's doing this, Nina's in this play." And I may not have fully understood what you were up to, but I loved hearing about you. It was like you were a postcard from a past life. And then a little while ago, your mom stopped coming into the store, so I stopped hearing about you. I wasn't sure what had happened, like she'd moved or something? Um, but honestly, at that point, um there was just no way to keep track of you, so, um, I, uh, I Googled you. You Googled me? Yeah, it's not that weird. Everyone does it now, but, um, I saw these photos of you online at this gala. You looked so fancy. What happened to you? I got involved with the wrong person. I met him senior year. He invited me to join his theatre company in New York, so I went. He was older, a playwright. James Thomas, but everyone called him Tom. I never told anyone about him. I never thought I'd ever come back. Well, I, uh... dropped out of college. Yeah, I don't know if your mom told you but, um... but I've kept writing. I mean, my poems are pretty terrible, but... I haven't given up. And sometimes I think about quitting my job and working at that bookstore by the pier. Hey, remember we had that plan? I was gonna write a play, and you were gonna star in it. We could still do that. Now. Tonight. Maria... I'm gonna get another drink. Do you want anything? No, I'm okay. Maria? Thank you. For what? For listening. Anyway, since we're new friends, do you want to play a game? A game? Okay, technically I made it up, but basically, we just stare at each other and then we tell each other's futures. Okay, what do I have to do? Okay, okay, okay. Gonna sit like this. Oh, God, okay. Um, now look at me. Mm-hmm. And we just stare at each other for five whole minutes. It's fine, I... I like to be looked at. Can we, um, blink? No. Yes. Okay. Yeah, just... Just don't breathe too heavily. Yeah, okay. Just, like I hate... It's serious. Okay, sure. This is serious. Okay, sure. This is your... I'm concentrating. Happy New Year! To see such things in nighttime remind me of when I had love. Which is the end of everything. Everything that I ever had. On this day, this new life which I begin! Again. And again, and again as I cut down all of these imaginary trees. Trees. Um, I feel like it's been five minutes. No, no, no, no. No. I'm really into this now. I'm picking up loads of things. Okay. I love this game. I feel like I'm really, really reading your soul. Okay, I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry. Really? Yeah. It's just there's this... this girl here. I mean, I think she's outside somewhere. I don't know. I mean, she just showed up. She just showed up tonight. And this makes you this anxious? Yeah, yeah, because I'm in love with her. I... You're in love with her? Maybe more like the idea of her. I don't... ugh. I don't know. I mean, I need to - I need to explore this... I need to like, figure it out. But anyway, thing... The thing... the thing... The thing is that she... She can't stand me. Okay, she hates me. She like honestly hates me. I mean, like, she used to do this thing where she would be like, "Hi, Dumb." And I'd be like, "What?" and she'd be like, "Hi, Dumb." And I'd be like, "My name is Dem." And then like everyone would laugh. I mean, it was like seventh grade, but like, I like, I don't know. So then, basically, she just shows up tonight. She just shows up out of the blue. What am I supposed to do with that? I mean, like nobody just like does that. That like, has to be something. Okay. I've got an idea. What about if I go up to her and speak to her? She doesn't know me, so... and I'm really good at reading energies. I can just pick up whether someone's cool or not. You know, what their vibe is. Okay. You know when you just kind of know? Yeah. Yeah. So, I can... I can do that for you. Wait, you'll do that for me? Yeah. Oh, my... That would... That would be amazing. Of course. Oh, my God. Okay, but first, how do I look? I think you know. What do you mean? You look amazing. Really? Yes. Really hot. Wait, wait, what... What was my future? Oh. Do you really want to know? Yeah. So, you're gonna die. But it's okay because the world's gonna end tonight. I know because I'm psychic. That checks out. Thank you. Mm. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Hey, do you know if, um, Sasha is still in there? Sasha? Long blonde hair, um, young... er No? A blonde child? No. No, no, no, she's a... She's a grown woman. Yeah. The stars are bright tonight. Must be something in the air. Yeah. Yeah, no they are. Actually, I, um, I teach astronomy. Sort of like, uh, like precious little gemstones from this distance, but... of course you have to remember that a lot of them are bigger and brighter than our sun. I knew a man was from the desert. From Israel. And he, uh, had platoon that was stuck in enemy territory. They could not find their way out. Gunfire, lost for days. And he looked up at the sky and said, "That is Cassiopeia. I can lead us home to safety." But it was not Cassiopeia. And they all died. We should all just fucking shoot ourselves. Okay. Hey, say hi to blonde baby for me. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Sasha. Sash. Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey. - Hi. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Do you want one? Oh, no, I don't smoke. It's not the '70s. God, it's such a beautiful sky tonight. Yeah. It is. Can I help you with something? Oh, sorry, I'm Ira. Nina. Nice to meet you. I already know, actually. Should I know who you are? No, no, no. I-I'm just visiting from... From England. Oh. So, how do you know Dem? How do you know Dem? We just met tonight. Everyone met tonight. It's a no. Hi, Dem. Hi, Nina. So, um, it's been really fun getting to read your energies. I mean, I sense there's some kind of disconnection. Which is cool. It's been interesting. But, um, yeah, I... I'll see you in a bit. I'm so sorry. I'm not giving up. I've been waiting for this for like, forever. It's like pretty sad, right? Who are those girls that have been following you around all night? Okay. Well, Natasha moved here a couple months ago. I used to work at Cambria Coffee, and she would come in there every single day. And finally, I asked her what she wanted. I mean, isn't that obvious? No, uh, actually she just wanted my weed. Best in the county. And Martha, Martha is her best friend. They met on the Ventura boardwalk or something. Rollerblading. Those girls? I mean, they're so obviously obsessed with you. Isn't that what you always wanted in high school? Yeah, yeah, I guess. I just... I wanted you. No, you didn't. Not really. Well, no, I... I just knew it wasn't gonna work out. I don't know why. I just wanted to tell you. I know it's stupid. It's just, I wanted to savor these last moments of Nina in my life. I mean, come on. You never wanted me. You came back for her, right? Um... Ow! Oh! Sorry. Dem! Dem! Dem! Dem. That's my cue. Nina... I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. Um, I... What's wrong? Nothing, um... you are first American woman who I'm... Yep. Kiss with. Okay. No, I look. I'm, um, I'm really sorry. I, uh... I'm not actually Russian. Uh, what? I'm not. My name isn't... Isn't Nikolai. It's Nick. It's Nick. It is Nick. I... I'm uh, Nick Walters. San Diego. Oh, my God. Yeah. But Anna said that you were... I know. She was... She was in on it. We met at a toothpaste commercial. So, tell me about the character. Well, he's uh, like this Russian teen. Ooh, Russian. Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty excited. I... I don't really have my vowel sounds down yet, but slow and steady. It's a little hard when you're just, like, doing it by yourself. I have an idea. I think you should try it out at the party. Like, be in character all evening? Yeah. Yeah. And I have this friend, she's really cute. I think you guys would make a really cute couple. Super gullible, loves exotic men. She dated this Turkish guy for a while, and I think she'd be like the perfect person to test it out on. She thought it would be a good way to sort of like, test out what I'm doing, you know? Um, well you were really convincing. Thank you! Yeah. Thanks, yeah. I, uh... I've been really trying to build something, you know, to kinda take me into the next step, you know? Into the next level. I... I have a second callback for a Wes Anderson spy thriller. It's kind of a big deal. Wes Anderson does spy thrillers? Yeah! Well, this is sort of like his first foray into like, a true genre, uh, spy thriller? You know, I... I think it'll be very good. I'm really intrigued to see how color translates in what is normally such a stark world, but, you know hopefully I like, I can sort of rein everything in and get my vowel sounds in really tight before I have to get into the room. Candle. Potted plant. Sink. Tea towel. Skill. And Mr. Murray's in it. The... the Bill Murray is in it. Right, yeah. So, I'm pretty excited. Great. Actually, my character was supposed to be a puppet. But they went a different direction, which, you know I'm... I'm trying to use a little of marionette to influence my being, but it... it's hard with that like, stoic, stiff Russian masculinity. Bye. Wh... wh... um... Yeah. Sorry, just take your hat. Okay, alright. Well, I mean, look, it... Yeah, just take that, as well. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Well, yeah. See you later. Okay. See you down there. Yep. Literally, let go. I can't! Hey, hey, where are you going? Have you seen Anna? She's been so nice. Wait no, are you... Are you leaving? Yeah. I booked a cab. I've got a hotel down the street. No, I've got a truck. I'll take you. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's fine No, come on. It's no big deal. Come on. No, really. Come on, I'll take you. Let's go find Anna. What is happening? Literally the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life. - Bye. - Bye! It's been so fun. Come to London! It was wonderful. I will. No, do come. Come. I'll come soon! Okay. She's like, "I've got to go to Disneyland. Quickly!" She was wearing Mickey Mouse ears. She was wearing those earlier! - Get home safe. - Bye. She just put them on? She was wearing them? Do you remember she put them on? She had something else on her head. She just put them on for the truck ride. She's like, "Oh, going on a truck! I gotta put on..." Got... got to get in my carriage now. I'm glad you came back. Me too. We okay? Yeah. Hold on. Excuse me. Hi! Happy New Year. Can I help... My name is Doreen Livingston Charles. I'm in the fourth grade at Cambria Middle, and I'm your neighbor. No, I don't live here. Whatever. My mom sent me over here because she said your party's too loud. It's almost 3:00 A.M. It's New Year's Eve, and we're on a cliff, so... You still have neighbors. Anyway, she's going through a really hard time. Why are you dressed like that? It's a party. A themed party. Wait a minute, I'm gonna get my sister, okay? Kids these days. Do you want to come in? That's so cool. Thank you. Let me take this. Okay, I'm gonna be right back, okay? One second. I love your dress. Thanks. Oh, sure, yeah. Literally. Dad? Dori? What... what... um, what are you doing here? You can't be here right now, sweetie. How did you know I was here? Where's your mom? Where's your mom? How did you get here? How did you know I was here? Let's just get outside really quick. How did you know I was here? How... how... how did you... How did you find me? Mom put a tracking device on your phone. What? Yeah, some sort of new app that tracks people. She told me to come up here, pretend to be the neighbor, try to get inside. It's really awesome in there. Oh, my God. Okay. Dad, don't take the Lord's name in vain. I'm sorry, okay? Look, you have to go, so where's your mom? Down the hill, in the car. She's pretty upset. She said to hit this button if you gave me any problems. Makes a really loud noise. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please. Okay? She cries a lot. She thinks you're dating some bimbo. She says it's the holidays, and you need to come home. I don't really have feelings about this situation. I'm just exhausted by the two of you. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Do you want me to come home? Alex? What's up? I heard there was a noise complaint. Nah, I lied. I'm not really the neighbor. Do you know her? I'm his daught... No, no, no. That's... look, I'm sorry. This is not how I wanted this to happen. We have to go. We'll... I'll... I'll call you. Dori! Dori, please. Come on, Dad. Let's go. I'm so sorry, um... I'm really sorry, Sasha. I'll... I'll call... I'll... I'll um, I'll... I'll text you. Whoa. Anna. That trick you played on me? What trick? Nick. He isn't actually Russian. It worked, right? Did you fuck him? Oh, my God, you did. Oh, my God! Yay! Fuck you, Anna. Can I join you? Sure. You're... you're uh, Anna's bo... uh, uh, Ah-na's boyfriend, right? Yeah. Is that what everyone knows me as? Uh, I mean, I don't, like, know your name or... Oh, I'm Andrei. Andrei Greller. Uh, Nick. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Wait, didn't you have an accent or something before? Yeah. Yeah, it's a... It's kind of a long story. I get it. You do? I mean, I don't get it get it, but you don't have to explain it to me. God. There are mainly girls at this party, right? I mean, here we are, just the dudes. Sorry, man, I have... It's been kind of a weird night. Um, I... I get it. I totally get it. I mean, you saw Anna before, right? I mean, she's like, she's so demanding, and then she gives me all this attention. Like, too much attention. You know, she's not like other girls. She's definitely not like other girls. ...criticizing this picture because I went to a really famous photographer, and I paid a lot of money for it, and now you're telling me that you don't think this... This picture's good. I was trying to tell you the truth. No, I'm actually gonna cry right now because, like I really... Babe, no! I didn't mean to do that. Look, look... Don't touch my phone! It's a little suffocating. I hope this is okay that I'm telling you this. I feel a little embarrassed about this, but it's brought something out in me that I don't think I've been able to express before. I've been scared to kind of talk about this and tell someone that... ...I'm gay. I'm fucking gay, man! You sure? Ye... yes, I'm sure! I don't know what to do about it. I should go. I should go back in there and tell her, right? No, but I can't, because then she'll fucking... It's like fucking my mom! She's gonna kill you, man. I know she's gonna fucking kill me! What the fuck am I gonna do? Do I go back in and just say, "Hi, I'm gay. I have to go"? I need to go. I need to go, man. I need to go inside. I should just fucking shoot myself. Mm. Um... Sasha? What are you talking about? That girl... in the red tulle, the... The... the blue dress? I don't know if she's lost. Maria, are you okay? Yeah. Why? Do you ever feel like everything is falling apart? Like nothing makes sense? All the time. I am nothing and a nobody, and nobody cares about me. If I never went home, my parents, they wouldn't notice. If I didn't show up to work to fucking restock the bait, my boss wouldn't care. If I die, nobody will read my poems. Or maybe they'll discover them years later, and I'll be proclaimed a genius. But honestly, when I think through everything, through my pointless, tired, almost 30 years on this earth, I am completely forgettable. Our generation, Nina, is completely forgettable. What do we live for? Maria, you're not forgettable. You're the reason that I came back. Let's dance. I kind of lied to you earlier. What? About going to New York. I went there looking for you. When? Two years ago. I saw your face and name on a poster, and I went to the theater where you worked, and I saw the show. Why didn't you say anything? When I saw you up there, I knew that you'd moved on. That you weren't a part of this anymore. And without you, and with you gone, I, even then, couldn't bring myself to see you. To wait for you there. So, I waited at this deli across the street, and I sat looking at the theater entrance, and then I saw you walking out with him. And there was just no way that I could intervene. I thought you were long gone. And I'm someone who, no one even remembers my face. And here I am sad, dressed just not like myself at all. And I'm like this invalid, this spirit of a person who lives off the Highway One with absolutely no purpose in life at all. It's funny how we see ourselves. The last play I did, I couldn't remember any of my lines, and I just thought, "That's it. It's over. I'm never gonna act again." You were wonderful on that stage. You were always a part of me, Maria. Part of me that I didn't really understand because I was scared to. Even though I was with Tom for all those years, and they were awful and abusive and fucked up, they made me feel safe. Because I didn't have to truly face who I was. And now that I'm sitting here with you, it all makes sense. And I just wish I had come home sooner. Well, I'm here. And that part of me, that part of my soul that was almost... I, um... I'm... I'm sorry. I... I thought you... In my mind, there is a dream. In my mind, there is a dream. Join me there. Join me there. Where you can feel alive. You can feel alive. - With me. - With me. In this never-ending space. In this never-ending space. - I am you. - I am you. - You are me. - And you are me. - Don't give up. - Don't give up. - Just give in. - Just give in. - Follow me. - Follow me. - What was that? - What... what was... - What's going on? - What was going... - Oh, my God. - What is it? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What's that? - Maria! - What happened? - Maria, get up! - Someone call an... - Call an ambulance! - Call an ambulance! - Get a towel! - Maria! - Maria, can you hear me? Are you okay? Maria! Cut! Okay. - How are you doing? - Thank you. I want to swap lenses though. Hey. I'm so glad you didn't die in real life. Really? Yeah. I know. "There's a little town up Highway One past the mountains and the seals called Cambria." Hey, those are my lines. Yeah, I know. I wanted your part. Really? It's a better part. Yeah. Alright, I gotta get to work. Okay. See you... See you later? Yeah. Okay, bye. Bye. In our lives, we dream. We often try to figure out what's real and what isn't real. What happens and what doesn't. To make sense of our existence while taking in the beauty of what's around us. The sea, the sky... ...the rolling hills, the earth. Even the simple things. To not take them for granted. Even what happens in our imaginations. How do we love beyond what we know? Who do we love, and what does it mean? And love, love makes us feel. It makes us soar. Beyond nothingness. And, well, everything else in life is just a game, I think. The decision to decide what's real and what isn't. It's up to us. My name is Maria. I work a lousy day job. I live off the Highway One. I ride a bike. New Year's is my least favorite holiday. Um, I am an artist, or at least I think I am. But I do, I do love someone, and she's special. And sometimes, I try to make sense of it. Everything that's happened. Sometimes I can, and sometimes I can't. And that's the beauty. The beauty of life. Or is it?
