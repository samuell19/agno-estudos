You're not gonna resist? You dress in outlandish clothes. I can't stand the sight of you! Cap and uniform is the dress code. Why don't you have your hat? I have it... I have it, too. If you have it, wear it! Take your hats off now. You bastard, take that! Damn morons! Stand up! Take that! You bastard! I can't ride the train with this face. I'm taking a hired car home. I'll take you to the station. Well, I'll find a hired car. Long time no see! What's the matter? You never call me, at all. I called you last night. I feel blue recently. So do I. Why don't we go play golf next Sunday? By the way, I hear Tonko had a fight with Kacchan. And, apparently, she likes you now. She calls you, right? She does. When? Yesterday? Everyday. That's what I thought. So, are you into her? You are too noisy! Mind your own business. Are you getting off at the next stop? - I will go with you until Yokohama. - You're too noisy! I've told you I'm feeling blue. See you. I will call you tonight. This local train is heading to Shibuya. The train that goes to Shibuya is on platform 10. There is no waiting for the express train. Please use this train. You look good. I'm sorry, but we have no money for the train ticket. I'm sorry, but could you lend us some money? I don't have enough money, either. I doubt that. You look wealthy. I borrowed these. I only have 100 yen. You must have a death wish. We'll meet again. Stay well, okay? I see... I also feel blue. Because... Koike calls you, doesn't she? I know she does. But it's up to you. I'm aware of that. That's right! I hear Tonko had a fight with Kacchan. Were you aware? You know what? You're the cause of it. She calls you, doesn't she? Stay quiet for a moment. - Welcome back. - Hey, handsome guy! Handsome guy! Handsome guy! Hey! Don't ignore us! Or are we not even worth your attention? Screw you! Damn it! Yes, I'm coming. Welcome back. Open the door whenever I'm back home. - Welcome back home. - Where's brother? He's not here yet. - He didn't return last night. - He'll be home later tonight, too. This house is haunted. There's no one here but spirits. I'm here, though. You are the ghost! - You're in a bad mood, aren't you? - Of course I am! See, your girlfriend is calling you. Cheer up, will you? Hello? - Will you have dinner right away? - Of course. It's Koike. What does she want? Hello? You are too noisy! We just met a bit ago. I won't go! I'm not in the mood, anyway. Goodbye. Eat the steak and cure your blues. We have Matsusaka beef. You only serve beef because it's easy to cock. Wash your hands first. I know. You are too noisy, too. The phone is really loud today. Tell her I'm not here. Hello? Yes. I see. He hasn't arrived home yet. Yes, see you, then. Who was it? It was Aikawa. Silly, you should have told him I'm here. Hello? Yamada speaking. Oh, it was you who called. Yes, I was home. That's because my nanny is mean. - You're lying. That's a false accusation. - Why can't you be quiet? Yeah, I wasn't talking to you. Well... today hasn't been a good day. I was planing to call you, anyway. I'm back. Welcome back. What a good timing. Yes. - We got Matsusaka beef. - Be quiet, you're too noisy! You're well as always. - He said he is feeling blue. - Shut up! Like I was saying... Those seniors are cocky. They still have four months before graduation. I'll train until then. - I will have my revenge on them. - Oh, how scary! That's why you should quit playing basketball - it's a girly sport. I'm also quitting golf. I can't tell you right now. I'll see you tomorrow at school. Take care, then. Goodbye. - You've been making suspicious calls. - How come? I will train myself from tomorrow. I'll beat them. Why would you say goodbye to a friend you see all the time? Of course I'd do that. We are good friends. What are you going to do tomorrow? - You two are going to study together? - We sure do. Really now? Shut up! You shut up! Jab, jab! One, two! Speed up! Speed up! Use your body! Jab! Jab! Jab! Pull your chin down. Straight! One, two! One, two! Speed up! Speed up! Use your body! What's the deal with you joining the boxing club? You're training yourself to get back at us? That's stupid! Say something! You bastard! Wait. If it's five against two, we're bound to lose. If you're a senior, you should be fighting one-on-one. You two are a pain in the neck. Alright, I will fight with you. Hey, you're fighting with him. You bastard! You bastard! Hey, Yamada! Is it you, Ichiro? I'm home. Where is Ichiro? He hasn't returned yet. What are you saying? You airhead! So rude... Oh, my! What's happened with your face? Let me see that. It's nothing, I'm okay. What if your eyes go bad? You are injured. Were you fighting with someone? - Mind your own business. - Go wash your face right away. Were you hit in the boxing ring? I'll hit whoever hits me. You are such an idiot. You should play basketball instead. I think boxing doesn't suit you. I'm going to grab some medicine for you. Oh, the mercurochrome medicine is missing. What's the matter? It seems Ichiro had a fight, so he got injured. We don't have mercurochrome medicine. What's that on your foot? I used it all for my athlete's foot. You'd better apply some other medicine. It's all red and disgusting. Go buy some. We do have other ointment. Other medicines will hurt him. Those would do the trick. Don't be silly! Go buy it. Alright, alright. I'd like to try other ointments. What's wrong with her? She's gone crazy. I feel I'm going crazy here, too. Leaving that aside, it's your friend that's the problem here. Yamada was his name? The queer one? You shouldn't be friends with that rich boy. I'm sure you can find someone better from your 40-50 students class. There isn't anyone decent enough. - Yamada is the best. - Don't joke around. Someone who does boxing can't be good. That sport is for hoodlums. Students should play other sports. The home of boxing is England! Huh, so what? England is also the home of pirates! I'm not surprised you look so bad. There isn't a single decent person among your friends. You got beaten up for looking so cocky. That's right. You, be quiet. Aikawa is the son of the restaurateur in Ginza? I was the one who invited him. That's right, he was talking about taking his revenge... Hey, don't say that! I worry about you. That hurts! You should be patient. Why have you started practicing boxing? You don't know the world, brother. You have no idea what's going on in the world. Boxing is popular in the Soviet Union and the US. - An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. - Don't scare me. Our father is busy with his work. And I am also busy with my studies. That's right! Your grades were good until you entered college. Do not say "until college". Your grades have dropped since you went to graduate school. That’s not true! Your grades have dropped tremendously. Students have to study, anyway. Your father is a corporate executive. And I am the maid of this house. Everyone should do their best to accomplish their jobs. This phone doesn't stop ringing! Hello? Yes, indeed we are. Yes, he is here now. Please wait a bit. It's him. It's not for you. Your girlfriend is on the phone. When I was younger, I didn't make as many calls. There was no phone at the time! When? Girls nowadays... They're too brazen or something. It's called being assertive. No wonder you can't concentrate on your studies. You are too noisy. Why can't you be quiet? I can't stay silent. I'm responsible for what happens here. I'm your mother's replacement. I've been raising you since you were babies. Do you understand? Welcome! Welcome! There is a seat upstairs. Here is fine. What a stylish place. It's my first time here. Can I take your order? - What do you want? - Let me see. It can be anything you like. Well, we’ll leave it up to you. Do you want saké? - Beer. - Certainly. - Welcome. - Welcome. Shall we go upstairs? Here is better. I don't really like to sit on the floor. You are being cold. I don't know what I should do. That's why I told you to do whatever you want. So, if I turn down the marriage proposal, what will you do? - Don't say it like that! - Then, how do you want me to say it? How am I supposed to answer if you ask me so seriously? This is a serious matter to me. That's why I didn't want to go upstairs. - Is the food ready upstairs? - Yes, it's ready. Is that person also a waitress? No, she's the owner's daughter. She is beautiful, isn't she? So, the man in the kitchen is her father? Then, that must be her mother. Yes, she's the owner. Aren't you asking a lot? I have a reason to ask. Is that so? Please bring the beer upstairs, Kiku! Yes! - How many beers did you deliver upstairs? - Eight. If they drink that much, they won't be able to taste the food. There are a lot of vulgar customers these days. The owner complains a lot. Let's go upstairs. You said you didn't like it. The owner of this place scares me. - Excuse me, we'll go upstairs. - Alright, go ahead. Welcome! You came here because you wanted to see that woman, right? - I'm surprised. - By what? She is certainly a beauty. Are you making fun of me? I'm in pain, you know? So, what am I supposed to do about that? You should say you'll marry me. Why do I have to say that? Because I like you! That's just ridiculous... Excuse me. You don't have to fix your posture. Shall I serve you? - Excuse me. - Yes. We had a call from Ichiro, he said he will stay at his friend's house tonight. At whose place? - He said around Yokohama... - He can't be helped! Again playing with his bad friends. There are many bad kids in the Yokohama region. I wonder if that's true. Don't joke around. Kids in Tokyo are way worse! A lot of high school kids are bad these days. He's quiet at home, but he has a lot friends who are no good. Just like the person in front of me. What do you mean? Please make yourselves at home. Shall I bring more beer? Please bring a lot. We don't care about the taste of your food. Certainly. Why did you say that?! You take an immediate interest in beautiful women. Refill me! Let's make a toast to our farewell. What the hell are you doing?! You're really awful. You know what? I'm nothing more than your friend. I didn't do anything wrong! You held my hand that night. You said it was a lovely moon. You were the one who held my hand! - And you got burned by my cigarette. - Not at that time! In the woods of Karuizawa... Even that time, you manipulated me to hold hands and sing. That's ridiculous! You'd even tarnish our memories? Excuse me. Oh, my, what happened with you? I'm soaked... We shouldn't have come upstairs. You wanted to see her face, that's why we came! I don't care about you anymore! We are leaving, so bring the check. I'm leaving! Please enjoy your time with her! Let me take care of your jacket. Sorry about this. Is your name Yamada? It's a boring name, I know. My brother's bad friend is also called Yamada. He's really troublesome. Please wait a moment. I'm in a bind, too! There's a phone call for you. Thank you. I'm exhausted! Isn't it too hectic to even think with the music on? I feel distressed when it's quiet. I heard that studying is done in a quiet place, I never heard of anyone studying in a noisy place on purpose. This house is haunted! I must be the ghost, then. I'm okay. I'm not fooling around. We are studying together. It's true! Ask my friend. You should study seriously. I don't want to be invited to the parents' meeting. I know that. See you. He said "goodbye" to me. It's no use complaining to him. That's because you're never called to meet the teacher. It'll be fine. If he flunks out, we can make him a cook. That kid will never learn how to cook. He just wants to play at his age. I have never studied in my life. Of course. You didn't even go to middle school. I didn't think anything of it at the time. My parents also told me that if I didn't like school, I could just quit. It was that simple! But you were always having fun. You got into the habit of it. Whenever you saw a girl, you'd ask her out. And I ended up with such a wife. Like husband, like wife. Ignorant and illiterate. Never even wrote a love letter. I can't believe this. Welcome. - Welcome! - Oh, excuse me! Oh, this seems like a good place. Thank you. The food and the women are wonderful here. Yes... - He's not talking about me. - Oh, don't be shy. You're not bad either, Kiku. - You mean my appearance from behind? - Well, if I were to be specific... So, I just serve as a foil. Welcome! Welcome. Oh... Mikako, he's the executive director of Yokohama Commercial. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. If he goes overboard and becomes a hindrance... - Please feel free to correct him. - It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Yamada. I'll come here from now on. Oh, my, is your name Yamada? Yes. You know him? No, a customer who just left was also called Yamada. Oh, what a coincidence! Which Yamada do you like the most? But the other customer was young. I'm also young, you know? But that Yamada was in a lot of trouble. He came here with a woman. But she splashed beer on his face. Oh, that's too bad! Then, do you also want to splash beer on my face? I don't trust any Yamada from Yokohama. I hear most of them are bad boys. What a fine thing to say! She saw right through you! That was harsh! It's my older brother. Shall I say hi to him? - Don't tell him anything weird. - Just leave it to me. I'm polite, you know? Welcome back. Give me something to eat. You haven't eaten? - I couldn't eat at the restaurant. - I'll prepare something now. Welcome home. Oh, it's you. - It's good to meet you. - Take a seat. What do you want to drink? Water is fine. Don't be so formal. - You don't have to hold back. - Alright. Do you have any siblings? I have an older sister. You must feel lonely, then? But Yamada also has just one sibling. It'd be hard enough to have several brothers like him. I have to be hard on you. My sister is also hard on me. She is a very beautiful woman. - She's famous at school. - So I've heard. - Your brother is famous at school, too. - Huh? How come? They say you're handsome and tall. Stop it. It'll go to his head. - But that's coming from a girl. - And who is that girl? Our plaything. Silly, I told you not to say anything funny to him. Enjoy your drink. - Do you want to eat beef steak? - Yes, I do. You always cook steak, anyway. You will be smarter if you just eat steak. Please study much harder! She is always complaining! You will have an exam soon? - We studied together. - I'm beat. You study while listening to jazz, right? Shut up! She is always so noisy. Shall we go back now? Okay, let's give our best! At any rate, his sister is surely beautiful! Why are you sticking your tongue out? Well, it's not a matter of which subject he is bad at. He's doing bad at all of them. He is not a bad student per se, but... How can I say it? He is a bit mysterious... I think he needs to study more. Moreover, he started to do boxing recently. Don't you think that coming home exhausted interferes with his studies? Well, whichever club he might join, I believe things would be the same. I'm sorry, I caught a cold. But he didn't have to pick a fisticuffs sport. And doesn't he have bad friends as well? How were Yamada's results these past exams? They weren't too good... I asked his brother to come, but he hasn't as of yet. He doesn't feel like coming. Birds of a feather flock together. Why doesn't he have any smarter friends? That's what I thought, too. They do seem to get along well. Well, they're both kind-hearted, after all. Well, they do have their defects... They're old enough to be interested in women. If only that were the case, we have countermeasures for that... But that's not the case. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with them. Do not assume that I'm giving up on them. I'm in trouble as a teacher. I've got a cold and I feel terrible. I'm sorry I'm late! Oh, my! You are here, too? You are Yamada's brother! I'm Hikaru's older brother. Why didn't you say it before? You were saying bad things about him, so, I lost my moment to say it. And you were with that woman. She had nothing to do with it! Teacher, I now understand what kind of friend Yamada is. - Can I go home? - Yes, go ahead. Thank you very much. - Excuse me. - Hold on, please! What do you mean you understand how my brother is? That's because he is your younger brother. - I'm sorry about that. - Don't worry about it. Please take a seat. It seems I caught a cold. Did you get hurt? Please have a sit. What a beautiful sister she is, right? Let me see, then... You need to consider whether your sister is wrong or you're wrong. I'm tired of being called to school every semester by your teacher. I will do it from now! You're all talk. Don't you want to go to university? I don't care. - He says he doesn't care. - You, be quiet! I'm not expecting for you to become a prodigy. I just want you to get into college, even if it's from the last place on the list. Don't you think you are blessed to be able to go to college, even on the last place, when others can't even dream of it? - I know that. - Show your appreciation. She's right. - I wonder about that. - Hey, dear! I'm thankful. But being happy is entirely different. What do you mean by "entirely different"? You are cheeky. I'm glad things were easier back in our time. Even back in our time, there was no one else like you. - You think so? - Of course we do! Anyway, you should stop boxing. I will stop if you want me to! - I think it's a good, manly sport... - Why can't you be quiet? And you should stop being friends with Yamada. What does he have to do with my academic performance? Both of you are doing poorly because you spend all time playing. But I think a man shouldn't only study, but also have fun. All you did was play back then! Please be quiet, will you? Are we clear? You can play as much as you want, as long as you study. See, I was right. Both of you, go back to the restaurant! I'm going, but, by the way, Fujii's son said the other day that he wants to take you as his wife. Give me a break! He just eloped not long ago. You should give it a thought, as well! I don't need you to tell me what to think! Wearing nice kimonos, bring beers, getting a nice guy... That makes you happy, right? Silly, you are just a kid! You don't have to study a lot. Just study a bit more. - A little study won't get you into college. - Right. What do you want to be in the future? You have to work and make a living for yourself. I'm sure I'll manage. I doubt that. What are you going to do after you finish university, then? I will work for a company. Then, what will you do? I will work there. He'll become the president or an executive. - Right! - And what's so great about that? What are you saying? That's a good job, isn't it so? Seems pointless to me. You are right. It might be pointless. What are you talking about? Having a meaning or not is not defined by results, it's all about the way you live. Then, tell me what way of life has meaning in this world. You wouldn't understand if I explained. I found out the hard way myself. Hello? Sorry, he is out now. I wonder what kind of families are these girls growing up in? In any case, you should stop seeing Aikawa for the time being. - Why? - That'll be the best for you two. Whatever! What a noisy phone! Hello? Oh, it's you, master. I wonder what these humans are thinking when they come here. They are not human beings. They are men and women. What's so great about Christmas? With the atomic bomb dust still in the air... What good would praying do you? I hope the atomic bomb kills them all. Brother! Let me sleep with you! What's wrong? I'm afraid of the ghosts! You are such an idiot! I could hear the rain. I felt so scared, I was shaking! What are you doing here at midnight? Sorry to keep you waiting. She is beautiful, isn't she? Yes, it's true, she is really beautiful. Thank you very much! - Are you from Kyoto? - Yes, I am. She's the owner's daughter of the inn that I frequent. Come now, don't call me that, I'm just a maid. Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is mine. I'm a maid here, too. It's a lot of work when your family is in the hospitality business. They use me a lot. - In return, business flourishes. - Oh, my! - Let me pour you some. - Thank you. Just a glass, please. Excuse me. - Mikako. - Yes? Mr. Yamada is here to see you. Mr. Yamada is downstairs? I brought him in the Tsuki room. - He wants to talk with you. - I'll go right away. Oh, what a strange thing. Whenever I come here, that Mr. Yamada also shows up. Then, please make yourselves at home. The nerve of him! - Sorry for the other day. - Please, excuse me, too. Well... - Where is the restroom? - This way, please. - It's at the end of the hallway. - Thank you. It's from a woman! Excuse me. Thanks for taking care of my brother. You're being sarcastic? You have such a strange brother. I could say the same about yours. But I wanted to talk to you in order to avoid misunderstandings. My brother is still a kid and he's not as bad as you think. I'm here to tell you how adorable my brother is. I would assume so. After all, your brother's family is well educated, unlike Ichiro's. I didn't mean it like that! Your family is also doing well, running a respectable business. You can't educate children well when you work in the nighttime business. I would say we are in the same boat. However, the first time I met you, I made a blunder. And I think that made you make assumptions about my brother. Anyway, since my brother is the only male sibling, he is very important to us! My brother is important, too! Why would it matter if he's the only male child or not? I don't want him asking my brother to play boxing. What if his nose grets broken? - That's what I told him! - Well, it didn't work, did it? If he's a good friend, he'd suggest him to stop boxing and start studying. He should also give him good advice, not only for fun. That's why I came here, to talk to you about that. While bringing your girlfriend and fight? But, at that time, you... You came here to check on our family, right? To know what kind of home my brother had? You don't have to... Don't get too comfortable with me! I'm not here as a maid... I'm sorry. You're here as his sister? As the owner! I'm flabbergasted! Anyway, call a waitress to get me some beer! Sure, if you're here as a customer, I don't mind acting as a maid. Beer, was it? Beer, huh? And this is where I got splashed last time. Let me serve it. Bring a beer to the Tsuki room. Sure! You don't have to worry. I'm not trying to be difficult. I am happy now. Excuse me. How is that Mr. Yamada? According to Kiku, he is a handsome man. I don't care about his looks. He upsets me. That's very suspicious! He is the brother of my brother's friend. That makes it even more suspicious! It's not suspicious, at all! His family is suspicious, though. The other day, the school called me again. I see, you seem to be in a bind. - What would you like? - Anything's fine. Oh, by the way... Can you call my home and tell them I will be staying at Tokyo tonight? - This is the phone number. - Sure. Oh, my, this phone number is... What? What about it? Now, everything makes sense! Let me tell you this clearly! I don't want my brother to be friends with your brother! I see, so that's what you think. I will tell my brother that. I'm disgusted with this. I'm the one who feels disgusted! You think only your brother is wonderful. And that the others are bad kids... I don't know whether your brother is bad or not, but... Aren't you being unreasonable? I'm disgusted with you and your father! What did you say? There's a beautiful woman with this man in the next room. Oh! Oh, it's you? It's you, dad, as I thought... Well, have a seat. Let me introduce her. Fate sure works in strange ways. - So, it was you, huh? - I'm embarrassed enough. Why are you embarrassed? I heard a woman splashed you with beer. He is my eldest son. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Welcome back. - Where is Ichiro? I don't know. How come? Is he here or not? - There's no point asking. - You're so annoying! He is not here, right? I wonder if he is with him. Hello? This is Yamada residence. No, he is not here. No, Hikaru is out now as well. Excuse me for asking. And, also, your master will be staying at Tokyo tonight. Yes, goodbye. I'm sure they're out messing around. Right attack! Right attack! Right attack! Shige... I feel like eating something, can you get me some green tea over rice? Shige! Yes. I want to have green tea over rice! Do you want to eat at midnight? But I'm starving. Isn't it bad to eat this late? I want to eat! There's a tangerine here! I want to eat green tea over rice! I'm so sleepy, though... Okay, I'll cook for you. You're always dozing off in your spare time. If a thief breaks in, you wouldn't notice. I'm afraid you're right. It can't really be helped. What are you even saying? What does Ichiro do when he is alone? I don't know about that. - Does he watch TV? - No. He told me watching TV is boring. You should watch it with him. I don't want to do that because it hurts my eyes. I wonder if they're showing anything interesting. Being alone is so boring. If being alone is so boring, why don't you get married? - It's not that easy. - Is that so? Ah, I wanted to watch that! You told me you didn't watch TV. But watching boxing is different. Men's muscles are so nice. Ah, you're so naughty! No way! I know you are, too, miss. What do you mean? I know you'd like to have a husband, miss. - Aren't good people coming to the store? - You're so rude! I have a very good man. The other day, I had a cough and he gave me some cold medicine. So, that's why you bought the wrong medicine the other day. I've got much better now, see? You disgust me... You should find a good man to marry, miss. Mind your own business! You pretender! I thought you were going to stay in Tokyo, since Aikawa called us. Well, the client preferred to stay in Atami instead. So, I escorted them to Minaguchi. What are going to do about him, though? Shall we find a home tutor? If he's not motivated, there's nothing we can do. Hello? This is Yamada residence. Oh, please wait a moment. It's your brother. No, I will take it. Hello? It's you, Hikaru? What? Is it you, daddy? Where are you playing at? Come back home soon. But it's really late now. Can I stay at my friend's place? You'll staying where exactly? At Aikawa's. What? Aikawa's house? Let me speak with him. Hold on a second. Hello? You shouldn't stay at his house. Why can't I? You can't and that's it. At any rate, come back home right now. Hello? Hikaru! Hello? You give me no choice... Can you tell me Aikawa's phone number? Sure. Hello? This is Aikawa residence. Hold on a second. Hello? Oh, it's you... What do you want? No, Ichiro also didn't come back home yet. So, he was calling from outside. My brother told me he would be staying there tonight. If he arrives there, please feel free to drive him out. Thank you. What? I thought he had returned already. It's very late now. Why don't we ask them when their son arrived home? But it's midnight now. Our trouble is mutual. Let me call them. Right. Well, shall we go to bed now? There's no way a bright child would come from this old man. Stop with your jokes! Boys take after their mothers! Yes, I see. No, he didn't come here. Yes, my brother returned home alone, and he is sleeping now. I will wake him up and ask him. Hold on a second. I'm sorry to disturb you. - What did they say? - Ichiro is on the phone now. Hello? Are you Ichiro? Yes, you're his brother, right? Did Hikaru say anything when you separate? He was very angry after your call. - He said his brother was being absurd. - He's right! Your sister is the one who is being absurd! My sister scolded me, too. You don't have to tell him that. You said goodbye right after that? He said he'd return home right away, and asked some money from me. It felt a bit strange, but I lent him all the money I had on me. - How much did you give him? - 300 yen. Do you know where he could be staying? Well, I have no idea besides our house... Let me talk with him. Hello? Yes, it's me. What did you say to your brother over the phone? Why does it matter what I told him? You're the one who gave me an earful. It's you who wants to break the friendship between them. If anything happens to my brother it will be on your conscience. Oh, my... He said if anything happens... You said something to Yamada's brother, didn't you? That's because you don't study much! I told you I will stop boxing next year. You should have done it sooner! I can't study in this house! There's no one to talk to here. No one to comfort me! The same goes for Yamada. No wonder he feels like dying. "Feel like dying..." What an exaggeration! Conscience, my foot. Both brothers are the same. And their father isn't any better. Hello? Yes, this is Yamada residence. Yes, yes, will you please wait a second? He is sleeping since he returned home late last night. I will wake him up now. Sir, there is a phone call from Atami. Is that so? Hello? It's you, Kiyo? It was terrible last night! Please come in, wait a moment. Yes. Aikawa is here with his sister. Really? That just woke me up! Hikaru stayed the night in Atami? Anyway, please ring him up. He did go there. Don't say "hello" to me! Why haven't you called us if you were going to stay in Atami? I couldn't sleep because I was so worried about you! I couldn't sleep either because I was afraid to hit the hay alone in my room. This person woke me up just before I did. After my brother made me angry, I thought I could stay here, even if I had no money. Yes... yes... Welcome. Oh, Ichiro. - We found my brother, he's on the phone now. - Really? - Where was he? - Please, take a seat. Where is he calling from? From Atami. Atami? He was relaxing at the spa. That's expected from your little brother! How nice it is to be carefree. My head hurts because of this. I couldn't sleep, at all. Were you worried about us? Of course, since you threatened me! But you overracted. Of course, I was worried about you. This is no laughing matter. My father will pick me up by car, so you can come with him. I'll wait for you. I'm sorry I can't send you all the way to Tokyo. It's faster if you take a train from Yokohama. I hate to say this while you're sending me off, but... I really didn't want Ichiro to go to Atami. Why is that? That person from Kyoto is there. But I couldn't tell him not to go at that time. You should've just told him. Oh, where are you going? I'm upset, so I have no idea where to go. You must be kidding! I'm not kidding. I haven't slept well. I wonder what happens if I speed up? My, you're awful! Where are you going? Stop here! The car will stop if I crash. You delinquent! Hoodlum! I am Hikaru's brother, after all. Why have you stopped here? I don't need a pretty landscape to talk to you. I don't want to talk with you. You are too selfish! You're always insulting me! Let go of me. Or I will shout. Help me! Somebody help me! Please, come in! You're so clumsy and shameless! Go ahead, complain as much as you want. It will keep me awake. I don't want to talk with you. Please take a nap, then. This will take a long time. You don't have to drive to Tokyo! I'm not driving to Tokyo but Atami. I can't believe you! If you worry about your brother, you should go pick him up. Yes, I worry about him. Your father was in our restaurant holding the hand of a woman. How can you show such a scene to a child? If they love each other, why not? I'm speechless. I don't want my brother involved with your household! No problem, so I should bring Ichiro back to you, right? Then, you can tie him up. Mind your own business. Poor boys. For both my brother and Ichiro to not feel loved by their brother and sister... That makes love the same as the atomic bomb dust. Once you touch it, you start to rot. I'm the rotten one. No, it's me! Here is a good place, shall we take a rest? Go ahead, if you're feeling tired. Then, let me have a smoke. Give me a cigarette, too, please. Here you go. I rarely smoke. Women smoke when they're in a bad mood. Is that so? You're wrong, though. I'm not in a bad mood. But you're certainly bored, because your job consists of taking care of drunkards. Drunkards are innocent, though! You think so? So, it's people like me and my father who are bad? If it's strictly business, it's fine. But isn't it great to take a rest from time to time? This sight of Mt. Fuji is quite rare. What do you think? It's very nice, isn't it? I don't need any pretty landscapes. I think you do need them. - If you look closely, the view is nice. - Are you talking about me or Mt. Fuji? The moon is in the east, the sun is in the west. It's really beautiful! You talk like a bad guy. You make everything look bad, except yourself. So, shall we go now? I still have a lot to drive. The sea looks so nice, right? What a lovely color! Can you stop here? - Have a smoke. - I'm fine, thanks. Okay, then. The closer we get to Atami, the more I feel it's better to not go. What? Let's go home, okay? Atami is right over there. We're almost there. They are having fun, so I don't want to bother them. It's not like I have anywhere to take him during his school holiday, anyway. That's a pity. It's a pity, indeed. But I'll turn a blind eye just for today. Ah, I wish I my eyes would go blind right now. You are sleepy, right? I've been so worried about my brother until now, that I didn't have eyes for anything else. Didn't you also feel the same? I wasn't, not even one bit! I guess that's just how you are. What do you mean? It seems like you're not aware that you were born beautiful. Spare me the flattery, I hear it enough at our restaurant. No wonder your personality is like this. You don't take sincere words seriously. So, what are you trying to say? Well, I am... In short... Anyway, please get in the car. Let's go home, then. Go ahead. The back seat is fine with me. Oh, is that a castle over there? That's Odawara castle. Shall we go see it? Don't worry. We're not here to sight-see. Mt. Fuji or a castle. I just remembered! Odawara's eel is delicious. Shall we eat some? I don't really like eel... We won't, then. Eel is supposed to be aphrodisiacal, anyway. You are funnier than I thought. Yes, that's right. Don't look behind you. It's dangerous! Thanks to my brother, we're having a nice drive. We have a guest! Please come in! Who could it be? - You're tired, right? - You must be, too. I'm a bit hungry now. I will get you something. Make yourself at home. Oh, my! - Welcome. - Thank you for having me. Thank you for always taking care of my brother. - Who might your brother be? - Ichiro's friend, Yamada. Ah, the problem child. I'm the problem child's brother. Anyway, welcome. Thank you for visiting us. Can you prepare a tea for him? Sure, I will. Please make yourself at home! What would you like to eat? - Anything is fine with me. - Then, how about eel? No, make it something more aphrodisiacal. Who is our guest? A fine man. - Could he be her future husband? - No way! Remember that problem kid, Ichiro's friend, who got into trouble last night? He is his brother. He would be suitable! No way! You will get Mikako upset. Silly! Despite being a woman, you know nothing about a woman's heart. I will go see him. Bring that tea, then. - Get me some plates. - Alright. Please come this way. - Get him a hand towel - Got it. And get me some salt, too. Oh! Thank you for having me Hello! You don't need to be so formal. Thank you for coming! Thank you for always being so mindful. Not at all, sorry that my brother is always causing trouble. Not at all. It's just that our daughter is too strict. Well, I'm afraid my brother has a bad reputation. Is that so? My daughter has a good reputation, you know, but no good man has asked for her hand yet. She's like a damaged tuna left unsold. You see, her bad character comes from her mother. Her good qualities come from me. What are you saying, father? Anyway, please make yourself at home. Young men and women are so nice... He looks good, right? But he's an airhead. Go ahead. How was it? It's love at first sight. I'm really glad. Not you! - Do you think Mikako likes him? - How do you expect me to know that? I also worry about lots of stuff. I mean, my brother is more under my care, after all. My brother is also very dear to me. I was a freshman in high school when our mother passed away. He was still in elementary school and I felt so bad for him. Luckily, our nanny was there for us. I know how you feel. He's going through a difficult time right now. That's why I took the opportunity to come here today. Please be patient and let this one go for your brother's sake. For me and my father's, too. I also may have said too much... Well, so did I. From now on, let's cooperate with each other and talk about our brothers. Let's do that. Let's shake hands! Mikako! - It was a call from Atami. - What was it about? He said he'll go to Kyoto from Atami directly. To Kyoto? No way, he shouldn't go! Did you hang up the phone? I did. Mr. Yamada, please call him right away. But didn't he ask you for permission to go? He said he will study hard starting from next year, so he asked me to let him go. Then, what was your reply? I told him Kyoto is a nice place, so he should go. No wonder he hung up! Did he go with everyone else? Perhaps. This is why I don't like him. He's such a softy. My father is the same, though. That's why I don't like him! Your father staying with that woman and flirting with her was disgusting. Holding her hands like that... - But didn't we also just shook hands? - I take that back! I see, then I will call him. Where is the phone? Over there. Kyoto at the end of the year is nice. You idiot! She's lost it completely. Hello? Is this Minamijien? It's Yamada speaking, can you call my father? Did he say they're coming back? I'll be going to Kyoto now. Did they leave already? They were probably afraid that we'd call back to scold them. I hear they have just left. I hate that about your father... Taking my brother to Kyoto without the family's permission. That's one of my father's strengths! Why would he call to ask for permission if the kids are having a good time? That may sound as an excuse, but I love that about my father. Thanks to him, now I also get to go and play in Kyoto. Excuse me! Would you mind giving me a ride if you're driving home? Sure thing. I can give you a ride all the way to Giza. Dad! Ouch! You hit my face! That's what you get for trying to hitch a ride like a penny-pincher. You fool! How frustrating! Ichiro really knows how to write! Of course, he's going to school. He's better than me, if he can write like this. Even I'm better than you. There's always someone better than you. - Isn't there anyone worse than me? - Nowadays, there isn't. Then, I can say that he's a wonderful son. I mean, if someone as bad as me can run a business like this, then someone like Ichiro could run a place twice or thrice as big. If it weren't for my support... If you hadn't interfered, this place would have been a building by now. Then, you'd have worked in the basement cafeteria? And you as a toilet cleaner. Both of you talk so much. Can't you keep your voices down? I'm busy on December 31st. I can't shut up. I have to work with my mouth and my hands. You're just upset about Kyoto. If you want to go, you should. No one will complain, anyway. I never said I wanted to go. Then, don't worry about it. Even if you can't get a man, I get a lot of marriage offers for you. From playboys, hooligans, gangster's sons, yakuzas... Thanks to you, business is going great. - Don't you agree? - Yes. Alright, shall we go back to work? - Can you get things ready? - Alright. Hello? Yes, yes. Yes, that's right. Could you hold on a second? Mikako, you have a call from Kyoto. Hello? Oh, it's you, Ichiro. What are you doing? What? Postcard? Of course it arrived. It came by express mail. Yes. Then, Yamada's dad has returned home. I see... So, when are you coming back home? What? You're returning home right after hearing the New Year bells? Yes... Hearing the New Year bells in Kyoto must be nice. Is it you, Mr. Yamada? - See? - Yes. Her voice sounds different now. Thank you for taking care of my brother. Huh? Oh, your lighter? Yes, we have it. Huh? Is that so? I see. I thought it was from your lover. Yes, I'll be sure to keep it safe. Well, but tonight will be very busy here... You don't have to worry about us! Yes. Yes, now if you'll excuse me. That was easy, wasn't it? Just wish and it shall be granted. He said this lighter was a memento of his mother. Mikako, why don't you go to Kyoto? I can't just go during New Year's Eve. - You don't need to be upset. - But I am upset! Get food, get drinks, go upstairs, go downstairs.... I don't know what I'm struggling for anymore. So, you should go to Kyoto and think about your life. Gong! Gong! Ichiro makes me worry all the time. The festival will make you forget about your problems. - Gong! - You sure are noisy! If you don't want me here, I'll go. I don't care about Ichiro or this restaurant. Okay, I will go to Kyoto alright. If I'm in the way, I'll go. Goodbye! Heh, she's got some nerve! Saying she's leaving because of us when she's meeting the man she loves. It seems like there is no one here. The door wasn't even locked. Welcome back... You shouldn't do that. The door has to be locked. I have to go to Kyoto now. Please, prepare my things. What's wrong? It's over for me! This is strange, to see you, who are strong of heart, cry. You got it all wrong, I'm actually faint of heart. You have tea cakes here. Did you have a visitor? Yes, he already left, though. Who? That man came to see me. That man? Oh, the drugstore man that you fancy? So, miss, will you listen to my story? I don't want to hear about such a topic. You're so cruel. Can't you see I'm sad? I am going to Kyoto. I have no time for this! Go ahead. Everyone is cold, anyway... Come on, tell me what happened. I will say it directly. I'm brokenhearted... Are you serious? Well, excuse me! People like you have no idea how I feel. You didn't have to say that. So, what happened? Actually, he said he wanted to talk to me about something. He's called Yoshio. Good name, isn't it? Then, what did that Yoshio do? - Please, listen to me! - I'm listening! My heart was racing... It's the first time in my life. - You'll have to guess. - I will. So, he came here? There was no one in the house... I served him tea and sweets... He left without eating anything... Please, eat if you'd like. You've been lied to, haven't you? No, no way! He was serious and proposed to me. That's good for you, isn't it? It wasn't good, at all... Yoshio's father has no wife now, so Yoshio asked me to marry his father. With his father! How old is Yoshio now? Twenty years old. Twenty, huh? I can still be called miss, you know? This is ridiculous. Don't cry and help me, will you? Today is the last day of the year. You'll find a better man next year. Well, I don't have much time! I want to go somewhere, too... You liked Yoshio that much? Liked really is an understatement. But I will forget him. Tomorrow, it'll be a new year. I'll start over with a fresh mind. That's right. I'll start over with a fresh mind, too. Is there anyone nice in Kyoto? There is, everyone's nice in Kyoto. Get the toiletries ready. Since it's the New Year, could you please introduce me to someone? - We got separated now. - They just want to talk alone. - They are young, after all. - Did you lose them? I guess they want to be alone. Let's go to the bell tower. I'm sure they'll be there. You may think of my father's relationship with Ms. Kyoko as immoral, but I don't. After our mother died, my father didn't bring any woman home for our sake. So, what if he got himself a girlfriend out there? Just as there is love for us, there can be love for my lonely father. Just like we have freedom, so does your father, doesn't he? Thank you. I'm glad you understand it. Let's shake hands. The bells started to ring. The New Year is finally here. This year, I'm going to take on the seniors. I'll knock them out! THE END
