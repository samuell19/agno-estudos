This is Marcia speaking. Yes, a cut with Mimi. The earliest we have would be Tuesday. ( phone ringing ) Good afternoon, Mimi's. This is Marcia. Hi, Amanda. Oh, thank you. Just let your bangs grow out. I'm sorry, I don't think we have anything that could accommodate a party of that size. Excuse me-- we're not a restaurant. Oh, wait-- this is perfect. We can take all six girls. You bet. A bridal shower extravaganza. Great... see you then. Oh, good... good. Okay. Appointments are on the screen. This shipment of polish is the right one. Coffee filters are in the back cupboard and the temp's on her way. Good luck. Thanks. I need it. No, you don't. You look great. Thank you. I always planned to go back to work but while my daughter Zoey was growing up I just felt it was important to be with her. My ex-husband did well enough that I didn't have to work. But I kept myself busy running school fund-raisers and annual charitable events. And, um, I started a community-outreach program at our church. So, even though I haven't been formally employed for the last 16 years I have kept up my managerial and organizational skills. And it's about a year and a half ago, I got divorced and my daughter doesn't need me the way she used to. Well, she's 16 now, so, of course, she doesn't. She doesn't really want me around school at all so, um, here I am. Well, it's good that you minored in journalism. People never realize how much memo-writing is involved when you run an office. Being clear on paper is a real plus. So what happens if I call and your teenager answers? No problem. Leave a message, I'll get an answer. Zoey's very responsible, very mature for her age. WOMAN: Zoey? Sorry. Smokey's mad 'cause I beat him at hearts. Good. It's healthy for him to be mad. Mrs. Cardona, here's your juice. Mrs. Cardona? Wow, looks like Elena finally has you beat, Larry. Put whiskey in it like I asked? Always. You ought to play poker. How come? You got that "hiding what's going on" kind of face. Virginia had that face. Hell of a poker player. Did you take your pain meds or are they in your pocket? Is that part of the volunteer program? To harass old men? The program ended last month. I'm harassing you on my own time. Oh, my gosh-- I have to go. I told my Mom I'd be there by 5:00. What'd you do that for? Now, she'll be mad at me. My mom? She never gets mad. Well, that's suspect. Do me a favor, will you? Name it. Bone up on your card game. ( chuckling ) See ya! Where is Zoey? What time does the library close? Are you asking me? Maybe I should just forget about being an office manager. I could teach elderly women how to do their own hair. Well, that's a really bad idea. "A", you'd be the competition and "b", they don't really come here for that. Well, they don't come for the coffee. No, they come to be cherished and fussed over just like you and me. Ah, there she is. Hey, punkin. MARCIA: Zoey. I'm sorry. I was just about to call the library. I know, I know. I guess I got buried in cellular structure. Oh, you know, that used to happen to me only it was in the back of Shawn McNab's car. ( laughter ) I thought you wanted to do highlights this afternoon. I thought you wanted me to have a 4.0. I do. Only because I know you're capable. But what I really want is for you to come with me to Weatherby's. But I'm supposed to study with Kayla. Couldn't you just tell her you'll be a little late? I really need your advice, honey. Maybe I just have all the wrong clothes for interviews. Oh... how'd it go? Well, they offered me a CEO position but I said it was too much work. Oh, I'll just put this in the back. Okay, call me paranoid but I just can't sleep at night unless everything is unplugged. Also, if you want me to pluck your eyebrows later you know, I'm available. Mimi, I hate how that feels. Shopping feels better. Bye. Bye. Bye. See you tomorrow. Mom. Oh. Ooh, we like this. Sure. Okay, does this say "professional"? Kind of says "dull." Really? Yeah. And this makes me look like a marshmallow. It stops at the completely wrong place on my thigh. It's just the light and these mirrors. They make everyone look like marshmallows. It's the perfect time to buy a winter coat, though. Look at this-- would you hire me? For what kind of job? Oh... Oh, look at that! That's handy. Go, go. You missed the tapioca. I'm not into tapioca anymore. That's all you're having? Yeah. Kayla's mom always makes something. Mm, okay. Listen, don't forget to call me when you get there. And I don't want you staying too late. You know, if I had a cell phone I'd call when I got there and when I was leaving and while I was driving home. Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, you should just be glad your dad and I agree on something. I'm not getting a cell phone. You're not getting a cell phone. ( slow dance music playing ) ♪ Why does it fade away? ♪ ♪ Hearts are broken every day... ♪ Marty, why would I call you if I didn't have the money? Wait, wait. Hang on. You're getting a call. Probably another invitation to the semiformal. Hello? No, it's Zoey. Can she call you back? Thanks. It was Brad. Okay, I'm back. No, Marty, one ten-dollar bag. Because that's all I can afford. Fine. Yeah, later. ( stereo clicks off ) Okay, so, identify the stages of the cell cycle. Uh, the stages of a cell cycle are the beginning stage, the middle stage and last stage? Maybe if you didn't leave your book at your dad's you could study the night before the night before the test. Or maybe if they figured out a better "who's got Zoey's schedule" instead of always changing it at the last minute. Whoever invented joint custody was a moron. Yeah, or else a parent who never got to see their kid. Okay, what do you think is better-- this one? Right? Or this? The first. Okay. Want one? Hmm-mm. Might make you jump higher. I'd just be higher when I jumped. Fine. Um... okay. The stages of a cell cycle are... interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Cool. So, who was the guy at lunch? That was random. Well, I know he's a transfer and he's totally hot so why's he talking to you? Because you have Brad. No, his name's Ron, he's a senior and... he couldn't find the language lab. ( knock on door ) Hey. Buttered popcorn in the kitchen. Well, Brad about died when I told him your parents got you a car. It's just 'cause they hate driving me back and forth to their houses. What do you think about him anyway? Oh, my God, are you guys... No! What... No, Zoey. Like, I wouldn't just mention that to my best friend? Well, how do I know? You're the one in love.

Thank you. ( muted music continues ) ( knock on window ) I don't see a "no solicitors" sign. What? It's a law. Now, if someone has a "no solicitors" sign and they come to your door, trying to sell something they can get arrested. Well, are you selling something? ( chuckling ): Well... I got a Ron Morris pre-owned beer if you're up to some backwash. ( laughs ) No, thanks. How come you're not staying? My mom expects me at a certain time. She freaks when I'm late. Ah. Mama's girl. Doesn't break rules, doesn't make waves. Doesn't get busted. Hmm. Well, you ever play with the big boys? Marty sells baby food. Now, I, on the other hand have a guaranteed, first-round knockout. They even made a movie about this one. It's, uh... Makes you feel like everything's for you. Ecstasy? Better. Like a cross between a rufi and a secci. So you are selling something. Yeah. Yeah, but you can't have it. You're not ready. Oh, really? Yeah. Uh, besides, it's probably out of your price range. Do you ever shoplift? Oh, God. It's an American pastime. Movie stars do it all the time. Well, of course, they got money to burn which makes it kind of weird, but... but you can do it. Have a one-item garage sale, then buy some of my candy. Something in the 50-dollar neighborhood. All right. All right, Mama's girl. Well, when you get tired of baby food, you let me know. ( door opening ) Hey, Punkin. You okay? Cramps. Oh... Your back hurt? It gets sore toward the end of the day. Certain tensions don't help. I was thinking of taking up nude dancing for the extra cash. You're kidding, right? Yes, I'm kidding. You should take some Midol for those cramps. You got that big bio exam tomorrow. Oh... I'll cheat off Kayla. Ah, don't even joke about it. Come here. Sweetheart, you would tell me if things were too... too hard with all the back and forth thing. You would tell me, right? Would it get me a cell phone? Nice try. You should get ready for bed. Do some studying. Great idea. I taped us a movie for Saturday night. Okay. MARCIA: Hi, sweetie. Good morning. Morning. Mom, I buy my lunch. I know, I just thought you might want some of this excellent fried chicken. Remember when you were little I used to put surprises in your lunch? Bet you want some money, though, huh? Oh, I don't think so. That's funny, I could have sworn I had two $20s in here. You bought clothes. Not with cash. Oh, right. I took money from your purse yesterday. I thought I'd need it for gas but I didn't. I can give it back. No, that's okay. Keep it. Just do me a favor, will you? Promise to stop me next time I try to move the washing machine by myself. Okay. I appreciate your telling me about taking the money. Mom, I didn't take it. I just forgot to tell you I had it. Okay. You want some eggs? No, thanks. I'm going to get doughnuts with Kayla. Oh, okay. Bye-bye. I'll call you. Okay. ( rock music plays ) You know, eating powdered donuts makes my teeth feel like they're wearing sweaters. That's because you're weird. RON: Zoey? Ron. Hey, um, do you know Kayla and Jan? Doesn't that powder make your teeth feel weird? That's what she just said. Nice. ( school bell rings ) Let's go. Wait. Better. I'll see you later. Okay. Oh... now he is what I call worthy. Yeah, looking for the language lab all right-- it's the language of love. And my Journalism minor gave me a lot of practice with clear, concise writing so memos would be no problem. Oh, point of fact is our office managers delegate the memo-writing. Now, did you say that you were a single mother of a teenage daughter? Yes. Zoey. My ex-husband and I actually share custody. He's very supportive. And she's a great kid. Um, straight A's... very responsible. No problems at all. ( soft music plays ) ( heart pounding ) That's $9.75. ( cash register beeps ) Thank you. ( heart continues pounding ) ( breathing heavily ) MAN: Excuse me, Miss. I'm sorry, Miss, you need to come with us. I didn't do anything. This will just be a minute. I didn't do anything. It'll be okay. Straight on through. Thank you. Can I help you? Yeah. My name is Larry Carter. My daughter Zoey is here. She's here on some kind of mix-up. Yeah, got that right. Average teenager's about as mixed up as a human being gets. Aliens steal their brains. No kidding? Yeah. They get them back eventually. Least yours doesn't talk filth. Hi. Hi, honey. So, did you call Mom? You asked me not to, didn't you? Thanks. So, what do I do to take my daughter home? The store manager was open to creative negotiation and he dropped the charges. So, you won't have a record. Will I lose the car? No, unfortunately, you need it. We'll pick it up on the way. What would you have done if I had been out of town? Oh, I'm assuming that you never plan to tell your mother about this. You know, my dad used to say if I ever stole anything it ought to be enough to live on for the rest of my life. Why a watch? I mean, you have a watch. Did you lose your watch? Were you afraid that if you told me you lost your watch... No, I told you. because I'm thinking of getting one for Kayla as a gift. It accidentally slipped off the counter into my purse-- it was an honest mistake. Okay. All right. Just, uh... before we get home, one thing. Just don't make this mistake again. I'm not going "home." I'm either at your house or Mom's house. I don't have a home anymore. Babe? Hmm? Someone's here. Oh, my God. I thought this was the bathroom at Mom's. Oh, God. Dad? Creepy woman that was with Dad? I thought I couldn't have a cell phone. "Big responsibility. I'll pay the bill." Yes! "Program it yourself. Hands-free set for driving. Everyone makes mistakes." You ought to know. ( bell ringing ) MARCIA: I-I don't know why she lied to me. Are you absolutely sure about the library? Yeah. The recording said they've been closed for renovations since the beginning of the school year. And she-- she said she's been going there every day. Wait, wait, wait. Is that her? Where? There. Yes. Get in the car. Who is he? I have no idea. She never mentioned a boy. You think she could have a boyfriend? Well, why not? She's pretty, she's 16 and she's your daughter. As I recall, you weren't exactly a nun. Yeah, but she would have mentioned it. We talk about everything. I don't believe you. First of all, he could just be her friend and second of all, so what if she lied? I mean, it's not a crime. She's ready to have her own life. You know what? He looks pretty good to me. Mimi, this isn't a joke. Oh, my God, he's going to kiss her. We shouldn't be watching. Okay, you're right. I am absolutely not going to watch this. Oh, this is really dangerous. They're sharing a soda. I feel like an idiot. ( sighs ) Whoa, they're getting in her car. Okay... let's go. We're out of here. Somehow, I feel I don't know my own daughter. Honey, you just don't know what 16 is anymore. ( soft dance music plays ) RON: Yeah? All right. How does it feel? Do you like them? ZOEY: Yeah, I like it. I knew you would. Hey. Hey. I thought you were going to go see Smokey today and take me to meet Mrs. What's-Her-Face. Oh, Mrs. Cardona. Uh, I can't make it today. We got to reschedule. Right. Well, thanks for not calling me back last night. I was at my dad's. Yeah, I know, I left a message. So did I. Let's go. See ya. See ya. It might be better if I drive. You might not want to be behind the wheel in five minutes. You'll be rolling pretty hard. ( phone rings ) Hello? Oh. Yes, Mr. Byers. Okay, sure... Chad. Ah. I see. Of course I understand. Yeah, well, there wasn't much I could do to make it look like I had recent work experience. Thank you. And thank you for calling. ( phone rings ) Hello. Larry, it's not a great time. What? Of course she's supposed to be at your house. Yeah, that's what I thought. I went to wake her up and she wasn't there and it didn't look like she'd been there so I thought you know, maybe she got the schedule confused and went to your house. No. Maybe she went to Kayla's and forgot to call. No, no. I was just at Kayla's. Kayla's mother took her to school because Zoey didn't show, so... Look, does it look like she's been over there? Marcia? She's not here. The bed hasn't been touched. Aw, jeez... wait a minute, wait a minute. No, this might be her. No. Damn! No. That's not her. Wait... her car is here. All right, I'm coming. I'm coming over there. Zoey? Zoey? Zoey, wake up! Zoey! Zoey? Zoey, wake up! She's lying in the backseat. I can't get the door open. Zoey. Open the door. It's locked? Do you have a spare key for this? No. Zoey! I have a spare key at home. I'm going to go get it. Get a rock. Let's just break the window. Zoey? Wait a sec, wait a sec. She's okay. Come on, honey, open the door. Good girl. Did you lose your key? For God's sake, what You were supposed to be at my house were you doing in there? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was studying at the library and I just... I got really tired and I think I was, um... I was using the key to your house as a bookmark and so I left it there and I drove here. And I don't know, I climbed in the back to get my backpack and I think I fell asleep in the backseat. All right, well, at least you're okay. And it was a good idea to lock the car. There were no good ideas last night. Look, she's here, and she's safe, okay? I mean, you let her off the hook for everything and now she thinks something through I'll go to school and you won't support it because it's not your idea? Larry, you have no idea what you're talking about. Guys, I just want to go to school. You're not even in the same loop. Hey! And whose fault is that? That's because you don't tell me anything... Hey! Isn't the point of divorce that you stop fighting? Come on, honey. You need to shower... have a bath. No, no, I don't. We're losing her. Larry, I called the library. Why does everything always have to be about loss? I know divorce wasn't in your plans. You know, believe it or not it wasn't in my plans, either but every time something happens that you can't handle, then it... Look, we both know Zoey is a great kid. And if every once in a while she shows terrible judgment we don't have to flip out, okay? I mean, this isn't about you. Uh, no, Mrs. Carter. Zoey wasn't reported absent or tardy. I can request to have her come to the office, if you like. No, no, that's okay. Thank you. We had a little... car trouble this morning and I just wanted to be sure she got there safely. Thank you. Well... there are several different types of medication here. I might not even be able to determine what everything is but whatever I do is going to take at least a couple of hours, okay? Okay. Well, Zoey's at school, so... I have a job interview and then I should stop by Mimi's, see if she needs me then I'll give you a call and see if you're finished. Sure, or come by. I'll be here, okay? Okay, thank you. MAN: So, ultimately, you would be queen and this would be your queendom. How many employees are there? Six full time and two part time. They definitely need a grown-up with some... how should I say, um, parenting experience. Oh, well, I definitely have that. My daughter Zoey is 16.

I just thought it was weird you didn't call back but I definitely did not picture you sleeping in your car. Your parents must have freaked. Not as much as they're gonna when they see the grade I got on that test. Why? I thought you studied? ( coach yelling ) Is that a hickey? Crap. Are you sleeping with Brad? No. Are you sleeping with Ron? What I do with Ron isn't any of your business. So... I know, like, going back and forth to your parents and not knowing what your schedule is like...

Yes? You finished? Well, not quite. I'm going to need a little bit more time to identify everything. But there are some capsules from your prescriptions as well as Larry's plus some nonprescription drugs, okay? Some uppers and downers and some very powerful narcotics which, all by themselves, can be highly addictive and if they're combined, they can be lethal. So, um, I... What do I, uh... Do you have to report this to the... No, no. But look... there's no reason for Zoey to have any of these, okay? She's either taking them or she's selling them. She needs some help. So, is Marty, like, your best friend? Nah. We move too much for me to have best friends. So, now that you've done the entree you going to go for the full-course meal? Maybe. What are you doing for the rest of the day? Being with you. There's someplace I want to take you. Cool. Oh, you got to learn how to play cards. Cards can fill up a whole space in your life. Help you pass the time when some woman breaks your heart. Hey, Zoey. Hi, Cora. Um, Cora, this is Ron. ( clears throat ) Nice to meet you, Cora. Likewise. Don't keep him long. It's nap time. If he doesn't rest, he gets cranky. Okay. Okay, deal. Deal. ( car approaches ) ( car door opens and shuts ) Zoey, I want to talk to you. Okay, in a minute. Now. What's going on? What? I phoned the library so I know you've been lying. Mom... Also, I went through your backpack and found the drugs. Okay, Mom, I've been hanging with friends instead of studying as much as I should but I'm telling you the truth. A few pills were mine but most of them, I was holding for other people, I swear. I don't even know what they are. Really? I'll tell you what they are. They're illegal narcotics, Zoey. And pills you stole from your father and me. Everyone has them, Mom. Besides, you didn't even notice they were gone. You've got five refills for everything. They help you stay awake to study. And then, once you've been up for three days straight and aced your stupid test they help you go to sleep. Mom, you always say, "Give it another chance." Come on. This is so not a big deal. You're, you're right. It's not a big deal. It's the biggest. You have no phone or Internet or driving privileges indefinitely. Now go get yourself cleaned up. Your father's on his way. All right. ( phone rings ) WOMAN: Benchmark Advertising. How may I direct your call? You're next, right? Mm-hmm. Is this your second appointment? Yours? Yeah. I made a doctor's appointment for my daughter before they called and I was just wondering if it'd be possible for us to... Sorry. I have another interview after this. I see. Thank you. Frances Manning. Excuse me. Sorry. We're running a bit late. Let's visualize other choices we could have made during those dark moments. Thus, we imagine letting go of our crutches beseeching our life truths to course through our crippled parts and then, then we stand. Lou? Stand, please. And we face ourselves walk down our own paths on our own. We'll mingle for a ten-minute break. Here we go. Nothing to say? I'm sorry about everything-- the library, the watch, my drug experimentation but these people are such losers. If you just think about it you'd know I'm not like them. I have to pee. Well, want to come make sure I don't shoot up in the bathroom? Come on. Come on. Come on. I wonder how she's going to take the news about the urine test. You're going to tell her. LOU: Shall we reunite, bring our feelings together? How did you find this place? The pediatrician gave me a list. "Drugs that cause false positives." "Tips for test-taking." "Use our urine, not yours." Oh, wait. Here it is. "Detoxifying bag." No, I'll get it overnighted to my dad's house. I can always get to his mail before he does. ( knocking ) Ron, I got to go. Hello? I thought you were going to take a shower. I will in the morning. You know your Dad and I both love you. Yeah, I know. ( bell rings ) Hey. Hey. They test you yet? So, no fun tonight, I guess? No, but I should have what I ordered by this afternoon. Cool. Catch you later. Okay. K! I was a jerk. Okay, so we agree on that. Look, there's been a lot going on and I've been kind of out of it and I didn't mean to be the way I was. Good. So... Since when are you driving? Well, since you got punished and Jan's carpool is full. I would take the bus but Mom doesn't want me to, so... You know what? I left my bio book at my dad's again. You wouldn't drive me there to get it, would you? Get in. ZOEY: Come on, Mom. Kayla already took me to Dad's. I got my book. No, we'll be at her house. Her mom will be there the whole time. Please, Mom, I won't do anything wrong. I got the message. ( no audio ) Thank you so much. Okay, I love you, too. Bye. Can we make a stop? Are you, are you kidding? Zoey... I'm just returning something, okay? Marty said he'd give me my money back if I hadn't used something and it doesn't look like I'm going to be using. It's so weird. It's like a regular business. It's on the way. ( rock music playing ) Hey. Where's Marty? Um... I think he's out back. Are you gonna roll tonight? Want a beer? Look out, look out. Sorry, sorry. Beer? No, thanks. Okay, I'll be right back. Kayla... Kayla, come on, how was I supposed to know he's crazy? I'm sorry. He's not crazy, Zoey, he's hammered. They all are. He was all over me. You have no idea what you're missing. Zoey... ( engine starts ) ( tires squealing ) Mom? Hmm? Is everything all right? Remember I told you I had one really good job interview? Yeah. Turns out I don't have the right qualifications. That sucks. What do they want? Fake boobs. Big ones. Mimi knows somebody who knows. They gave a multitasking, room-for-advancement job to someone with over-the-counter fake boobs. ( sighs ) Will you turn up the heating pad? Maybe you should get a pair. ( chuckles ) Maybe I should. I'm going nowhere fast at Mimi's. Funny how things don't turn out the way you plan. I'm really tired. Good night. Night. ( bell rings ) MAN: This is common for kids your age, Zoey. Body's working overtime and the brain's bound to take a header, right? But you're lucky though you've got parents who are involved with your schooling. You talked to my parents? Zoey, you failed a simple test. Look... you know you can talk to me about what's going on, right? My life is going on. Not what you choose or my parents or my friends choose-- my life. So screw you and yours. GIRL: Oh, no, I know, no one can ever find the language lab. It's okay-- come on, I'm going in that direction. RON: Cool. MARCIA: Just tell me what to do, Mimi. I don't know what to do. Okay. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, and what I know is... she's not driving, she's not at Kayla's she's not at Larry's... I don't know, nobody seems to know the boyfriend's number. I can't call. What? Wait a sec... Oh, my God. ( sighs ) The car's gone. Yeah. I don't know, she must've had another set of keys made. Wait a second. I think... I think she might be... Yeah, she's just pulling up now. I'll call you back. ( car door closes ) MARCIA: I don't know if she took something, Larry she can't even talk. Honey... Honey, listen to me. We're almost there. Shiloh General, emergency. ( horn honks, tires screech ) Oh, my God, oh, my God. Stay with me, honey. Just stay with me now. Help! Help! Help! Help me! What happened? I think maybe she took something. You're her mother? Yes. What'd she take? What's her name? I don't know. Zoey. Zoey... Zoey... Zoey, Zoey. Open your eyes for me, Zoey. She's not responding. Maya! I got an overdose coming to you in Trauma One. Okay. I'm going to need the correct spelling of her name... Okay, Zoey, stick with us. and her medical card. No, I don't have any card with me. Come on, Zoey, open your eyes. She's going to need to be tubed. Page Dr. Archer stat and get respiratory down here. As soon as you get a line in, give her some Narcan and see if that wakes her up a bit. I've got an 18 in her ACF. Come on, sweetie. Point eight of Narcan in. Come on, kiddo you got to breathe better than this or you get the nose hose and the breathing tube. Pressure's only 80. I'm going to start a bolus. Okay, what do we got? It's an overdose. GCS of three. No response to point eight of Narcan. She's in regular sinus brady of 56. No blocks, QRS is normal. BP is 80/50. Unassisted resps about four. Sats are 100% with bagging. Let's get her tubed. Get an NG down her, 250 of charcoal. Let's do a CBC chem 7, tox screen, send a urine. How long has she been down for? It's unclear. Her mom found her unresponsive. Any idea what she took? No, I'd guess benzos by the level of consciousness. Give me some suction here. Where's respiratory with the vent? They've been paged. And the irony is, without kids like you, I'd be unemployed. All right. Here's the deal... Zoey. I listen to you, you listen to me and one of us might learn something. Yes, ma'am, that's right. Yes, just give me that information and I put it in the chart. ( whispers ): The Carters here? Hi. Excuse me, can you tell us anything about our daughter? Are you the doctor? I'm Mike Harper, a psychiatric social worker. Dr. Archer looked after Zoey this evening. I met Dr. Archer. Zoey's stable but she's still unconscious. I'm Marcia Carter. I brought her in. I'm Larry Carter. In a few hours, the lab will be able to tell us what was in Zoey's system. A few hours? We can't see her before then? Can we be there when she wakes up? Mrs. Carter, Zoey almost died tonight. When she regains consciousness it's essential she be in a calm and a controlled environment and that will also give the staff a chance to thoroughly examine her condition. What's going to help Zoey right now is you giving me all the information that you can. Okay. All right. What about prescription drugs in the home? Well, I take a muscle-relaxant for a shoulder injury and also an antidepressant. Uh... and I've had a lot of dental work lately so I take something for the pain. All right, and Zoey has access to these medications? BOTH: Yeah. Okay. To your knowledge has Zoey had a history of drug abuse? No. No. Alcohol? No, definitely no alcohol. No, but Marcia found some pills and... MARCIA: Yes. Um, Zoey said all the kids took them and she was just keeping them for somebody else. I told her that was not acceptable. And a few times, she did say that she took something to help her study. We are aware of the problems teenagers face and even though we don't live together-- we're divorced-- we're there for Zoey. I mean, we-we talk as a family. We keep track of her and she knows that there's consequences when she doesn't follow the rule. I mean... Okay, great. Great. Now... generally, when we see a patient as critical as Zoey, it's not their first exposure to the drug culture. ( knocking ) Excuse me. Zoey's awake. Mike. Dr. Scheckman, let me introduce to you Zoey's parents. This is Marcia and Larry Carter. This is Dr. Vivian Scheckman. She is our head psychiatrist and the head of our in-patient psychiatric unit with which we do business. We'll speak at length tomorrow and if I could be of any assistance. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thanks, Doctor. Hey, punkin pie. It's Mommy. Hey, Zoe. Uh... She was intubated. A tube was put down her throat, so talking probably hurts. There's no rush. But she's going to be okay? She should be fine. You hear that, sweetheart? You're going to be fine. You don't have to worry about anything. This is so great. You certainly look a lot better. Your dad and I camped out in the visitor's lounge last night. He's freshening up. Morning. Good morning. Hello, Zoey. Remember me? Psychiatric social worker extraordinaire? Hi. Well, you look well enough to come home. Doesn't she? Or to Mom's. I believe they're keeping Zoey for observation. Oh. Why? I mean, it's not hard to tell that she's better. Yes, well, both doctors have written orders. Oh. Well, we appreciate their interest. My understanding is that home is the best place to recover. Well, yes, often that is the case. Well, then, the best choice is home. Maybe we could discuss this outside. I think we've discussed it. Is this your stuff here, honey? It's the law, Mr. Carter. When someone is brought in in Zoey's condition, the attending physician can request that they remain for up to 72 hours. Well, they can request all they want. If you attempt to take Zoey from the hospital y... you'll be breaking the law. Well, then I'll just have my lawyer deal with this, okay? Because my daughter's going home. LARRY: Look, I'll take care of it as soon as I get back from Chicago. Thanks. MARCIA: I don't understand. You said you were going to have your lawyer get her out of there and now, she's still there and you're leaving town? I made a mistake, okay? I can admit it. But this Dr. Scheckman seems okay and at least Zoey will be getting some discipline which she could use. She's 16 years old. She's in a strange place with who knows what kind of people. And I don't get this thing where she's the one who decides who visits and who doesn't. And even if she says she doesn't want to see us I think you should be there. And I'm not so sure Scheckman's okay. Why? Now, I checked her out. This woman has credentials coming out of her ears. Big politicians send their kids to her program. Oh, yeah? And how are they doing? Look, I-I don't believe you. Zoey almost died, and you're worried about how long she's going to be away from you? She's more important than any business trip you're ever going to take. And I think this is a time when you should be there for her. Zoey doesn't care whether I'm there or not. You're so wrong. ( sighs ) ( buzzer sounds ) Hey, Doc, when can you get my sketch pad? WOMAN: Okay, see you, Julia. You missed breakfast. Too bad, too. It was great-- French toast real deal maple syrup, powdered sugar. Right. The last girl believed me. What happened to her? She's not here. Your mom dropped those off. I'm Julia. I'm Zoey. Yeah, they confiscate everything. Shoelaces, belts, hair scrunchys. Have to keep it away from the likes of us "troubled minds," you know? Hair scrunchys? Yeah. So, what kind of troubled mind are you? ( sighs ) You ever heard of a close family? Sure. Well, mine was too close so I tried to go away. Where did you go? To buy syringes. So, do you ever even, like, see your family? My brother and my dad are locked up, so... What about your Mom? ( scoffs ) Still drunk, is my guess. Good morning, everyone. For those of you whom I haven't met yet I'm Dr. Vivian Scheckman the director of this rehabilitation facility. I will be supervising most of the group sessions and I look forward to speaking to each and every one of you. Julia? Would you like to start? ( phone rings ) Good afternoon, Mimi's. This is Marcia. Uh, let's see. Uh, it... looks like there's a 2:30 with Mimi, but just hold... You've double-booked yourself. All day Wednesday. Yes, that would be fine. Great. We'll see you then. What can I say? I need you. Apparently, you're the only one. Okay, Pam, could you just put some product in there? Sure, Mimi. Everybody knows kids don't come with a set of instructions. ( phone ringing ) Oh. And why do you think I never adopted or, you know, made a withdrawal from a sperm bank or tricked some international playboy? You know, into giving me millions in child support? ( laughs ) ( bell rings ) Kayla. Hey. Hi. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to talk with you for a minute. Is this a bad time? Do you think you could... ? No, no. ...wait over there? No. Don't sweat it. You sure? Yeah. You know what? I think I'll just, uh, double-book myself you know, for the rest of the week. Thanks. You're a good friend. Oh, you're a lousy employee. Go. Bye, Mimi. Bye, honey. KAYLA: I didn't really know what to do. I mean, Brad tells me I stress about stuff too much and my parents told me what they almost always tell me. It's my decision, and... ( sighs ) I straightened Zoey's locker. It's a little money, a few pills, and... some weed and rolling papers and stuff. She's been unhappy for a while. About a lot of things. And that guy, Ron-- the guy she likes, Ron Morris... He-he's cute, right? He's not a good guy. I still don't get why I'm here. I was being honest, all right? That's how I am. And if I'm going to get punished with a private session every time I say what I think we're going to be seeing a lot of each other. Well, I think it's really important to express yourself, but... that might have been a little over the top. She was pushing Julia to say things that she didn't want to say. What do you people want? For you to find a way to manage your world without having to reduce it by doing drugs. I was really upset and tired and I took the wrong combination of pills by mistake. Well, mistakes happen. Look, I'm fine now. My world is fine, and if you don't think so why don't you fix it, so I can get out of here? Actually, you have that backwards. You have to fix it, so that you can get out of here. Okay. How do I fix it? Tell me why you're here. My parents got a divorce, it pissed me off and I freaked out by mistake. Can I go now? That's right. I forgot. The drug dealers have that secret pact where they only sell drugs to kids whose parents are divorced. Is that supposed to be funny? It's supposed to suggest that if you want to get to the root of your woes you need to dig a little deeper. If you want to get out. Okay. My dad works as a communications coach but his hobby is women. Of course, my mom didn't realize that when she married him but then once she became the perfect wife and mother and figured out what was really going on she got mad at herself, 'cause she felt like a jerk. Plus, she got mad at him, because he was a jerk. Then they went their separate, jerky ways. Now can I go? Almost. How do you feel about what you just said? I don't know. Incorrect. What's the population of Argentina? I don't know. Correct. How do you feel about what you just told me? I said I don't know. Incorrect. What's the longitude and latitude of Scotland? I don't know. Correct. How do you feel about what you just told me? I don't want to talk about this! Correct. You can go. Yeah, okay. Of course, I know it isn't specifically because of the divorce. Right. But e-every child is an individual and every individual is going to react individually to the same event. Right. But even, even when we were married... Larry and I were far from the perfect parents. Perfect's a word I-I... don't have much experience with. ( laughs softly ) I've never been in a therapist's office before. They're all pretty much like this. ( laughs softly ) How does it feel? I feel like I'm in a nightmare. I feel... guilty. I feel I've done something wrong... or I'm doing something wrong... to have my child turn to drugs, and I... if I could just... figure out exactly what it is and change it, stop it, then maybe I could... I could turn around some of Zoey's behavior. Marcia, you have to understand this isn't about something that you've done. Zoey's the one down the hall in the lockup with the drugs in her system, probably... probably itching to go out and get some more. Right, and the fact that she's involved with drugs means something. What? It means that... that, that, that along the way, I messed up. I did something wrong. You probably did 10,000 things wrong. Every parent does. But Zoey's her own person. She's not you. I-I-I'm sorry, with all due respect I-I have no idea what you're getting at. ( sniffles ) Look... Zoey almost died and-and I'm here with, with my tail between my legs to ask just one question. I need to know what I did wrong and what I can do to fix it. I wish I could tell you, but I can't. I don't know what's wrong with Zoey and she certainly doesn't know and the drugs are... just a symptom. But what I've been trying to say is that the person responsible for understanding Zoey's issues-- for dealing with them or fixing them-- is Zoey. P.A.: Orderly to Day Room. Orderly to Day Room. What are you doing? Hey. Those private sessions really take it out of you, huh? That'll teach you to protect your fellow inmates. I like those. Why are you changing them? I'm not. I'm leaving. Where to? till the courts decide where to put me. Or I decide where not to put me. So, are you seeing your mom today? How did you know that? I saw her name on the visitors request log. Yeah. I might as well get it over with. She'll just get more freaked the more I don't want to see her. P.A.: The Visitors Lounge is now open. Please meet your guests in the Visitors Lounge. Okay, you better hug me. I probably won't be here when you get back, so... Good luck. You, too. You going to be all right? N-no matter how much she tells me she hates it here... Or she tells you there are drugs here and she's being subjected to awful tortures... I tell her I can't save her. Because you can't. Well, thank you, I guess. Have a seat right over here. Okay. Ah. Your mom's waiting. Oh, F.Y.I.... I'm on duty tonight. Hey, Punkin. I'd prefer you didn't call me that. Okay. Well, Mimi sends you her love. Where's Dad? Business trip. With his girlfriend? You can ask him yourself in two weeks when he gets back. I've got all the stuff from your locker-- the pipe, grass, pills, everything. There's drugs here, you know. Everyone has them. I can get anything I want. Oh, Mom... please, please please forgive me, I'm begging you but this place is such a nightmare. I will never do anything like this again. Just get me out. If you want to get out of here, you've got to do it yourself. I can't do it for you. Well, then, I guess you can go. Zoey... No, it's my choice here who I see and for how long. Okay. Okay. Bye then. Hey. You weren't on the visitors log. Yeah, I know. I think they made a mistake, or something. I mean, they didn't even ask me any questions. I just came right up. Did you see my mom? She was here, too. Yeah, she was definitely here. Of course, it could have been worse, you know? It could have been my dad which would have been really boring except that he's out of town on business... which isn't all that different from when he's in town, but... So, now that I'm in here, I'm guessing you think you're, like, superior, or something? I think Ron's a jerk. Ron doesn't have anything to do with this. Well, at least he didn't rat on me which someone did, because they gave everything that was in the locker to my mom. That was me. There's only one reason you would ever rat on a friend and, and that's if you know that they're in bad trouble and, um... and you love them. Thanks for stopping by. You might want to know that Ron hit on me, too. Well, you'd make a great couple. I think you should go for it. ( phone ringing ) ( phone ringing ) WOMAN: Hello. Hi, is this the Horizons Retirement Home? Yes, it is. Good. Is Cora Sims there? Cora! Cora, it's me, Zoey. Hi, Zoey. I'm so glad you answered. I've been meaning to call for awhile. Honey, I know you're calling for Smokey. I'm sorry, what? Have you heard? Have I heard what? Have you heard that he had a severe heart attack and passed away? Say that again. Smokey died. He's dead? I'm sorry, honey. I know how much he meant to you. When? It just happened yesterday. He hadn't heard from you, and I'm just starting to make the phone calls. Hang up. Zoey? Now. Zoey, honey? ( sobbing ) ( talking incoherently ) I thought I was, but I'm not. I'm not fine! I... MARCIA: So, did they talk to you about going back to school? Seeing your friends? Mom, I'm fine, okay? I can handle it. Just let me handle it. MIMI: Zoey! Hey! Hey. Welcome home, sweetie. Hi. Oh, so glad she's home. Let me see. Oh... ( clicks tongue ) You look like someone who's in need of... seafood pasta. From Victonio's? Yes. And wait'll you see what I got for dessert. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Yes. So you're going to go back to school, sweetie. I bet you're excited, hmm? Yeah, but if you ask me, it would've made more sense to let me do some school work at the rehab center. Well, you only missed a month of school. And still you get to finish this semester with your friends. ( mumbling ) ( laughs ): Okay, thanks. Uh, bring the bakery box, all right? Okay. ( plates rattling ) And I think it was great of Mr. Rogers to start that plan for you. She's got a kind of after school study program to-to catch up. You know, and then you can choose your community service and figure out how many hours you have to put in. And sit in your office every day doing nothing. ( gasping ) Oh, my gosh. Oh... ( chuckling ) Okay. So, Mom, what happens if my community service is, like, not somewhere close? Well, I'll have to drive you. As I mentioned on several visits when you're willing to start a step program you'll get your driving privileges back. And as I mentioned to you I don't need to be in a step program. MIKE: Then I guess it's no privileges. That-that's the deal, right? You start a step program and there's driving and then, what else was it? Uh, you don't have to come to my office after school. And you get your cell phone back. Right. So, no driving, no phone... no freedom. But I didn't make that deal. So it's not a deal, it's a rule. How's this? Dad and I make the rules. You decide if you want to live by them. ( scoffs ): Like that's really fair. They're the rules, Zoe. Come on, it's not going to make any difference if I go to a meeting with a bunch of drug addicts who introduce themselves just so they can say they have no power over their lives. Please, I don't want to go. Well, then, don't. You know, yesterday I realized you were the first official patient of my private practice. I was glad it was you. ( chuckles lightly ): Okay. Zoey. Hey. Hey, I didn't know you were here. Uh, today's my first day back. They change any of your classes? No, I just have to wait till the end of this week to get my community service assignment, so... Hey, Zoe. Back from the trenches, huh? What's that supposed to mean? You made it-- you went into hell and you came back for more. Yippee-ki-yay. Hey, I hear they got more stuff on the inside than out here. Is that true? How you doin'? Let's go. She broke up with Brad. I'm just... Hey. Hey. BOY: We got to get home. Call me later. GIRL: Yeah, we got to run. ZOEY: Don't get out. Excuse me? No, I just meant, please, don't get out. Because, you know, you want to go and if you get out, then, you know you can't get back in in time and... Did you also mean to say, "Um, thanks for picking me up, Mom. And how was your day?" Yeah. I was just about to say that. ( engine starting ) Excellent. MARCIA: Did you return the key? Mom, you've asked me that every day this week. Except one, which was the day you left it in the bathroom. It's returned. My supervisor just asked me to join him in a meeting that could last past 5:00, so... you're going to have to wait. Here? Where else? What'll I do? Do your homework. But it's almost done. Then read a magazine. Mom, I've read them. I read them all by Wednesday and now I have nothing to do. Can't you just drop me off at home before your meeting? No. Please? Just this once? I've got to go. Fine! This is a good job, Zoe. And I'm going to do what I have to to keep it. If I could, I'd wave a wand and make everything that's bothering you go away. But I can't-I can't do that. I can't fix things for you. Only you can. ( door closes ) Well, the timing of that meeting couldn't have been better. What did you say the address was? 10-10. Ten. Even. That's a couple of blocks up, on the right. I think you made a great choice for your community service. It's nice that you're going to be working with retarded people. ( laughs ) Developmentally disabled. Oh. I didn't know. You know they call us "normaloids." We're normaloids? Yep. I don't think so. Okay, this should be it coming up. Is this where they live? Uh, no, this isn't where they live. Because I don't start community service until the beginning of next week. What? This is where the step program is. And you're not supposed to come in with me 'cause I have to do this alone. It'll be over in an hour. I'll be here. Captioning sponsored by VIACOM PRODUCTIONS
