[WIND HOWLING] Be still, my cousin. Be still. Rebecca. It has been many years, my cousin. And at the end of it a long journey, by the look of you. From El Agheila. From the sea. You are welcome among your father's people, my cousin. But now I must go on. - It has to do with this war. - [GRUNTS] One tribe of infidel fighting another tribe of infidel. My mother's people are in this war. A man should follow his father's people. And if a man has two fathers? A father and a fatherland? The Germans are like the nomads, proud and strong. They will win this war and rule the world. Inshallah. Asyut is nearby. - Do the trains still run there? - They run. If you wish, when you have your strength, I will bring you into the city. I must go in alone. This case I leave with you. It will be safe? It will. But you will not be fit enough to travel for many days, my dear. You rest. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. [LAUGHS] You don't change. I live here. What is going on here? What are you doing to my clothing? Ah, you are the lady who lives here? Of course. - What is the meaning of this outrage? - The meaning we know. The subject of this outrage, however, is more elusive. Where is Claude Regasse? Perhaps you could respond civilly to a civil question, Sergeant. Why are these... people, vandalizing my apartment? Ma'am, the Egyptian police, under the able direction of Superintendent Kemel here, are assisting the British army in the apprehension of Mr. Claude Regasse and the recovery of British property stolen by that individual for sale on the black market. That is absurd. Claude is a respectable businessman engaged in the export/import trade. I'm sorry, ma'am, but these cases, found in a locked closet in your bedroom, contain British military issue. May I ask your name, ma'am? Elene. Elene Fontana. Try Sarah Askenazy. - What about this stuff, Sarah? - I prefer Elene. Elene Fontana, actually. And I do not know anything... Major whatever your name is. You know anything about the black market? Thefts? You didn't know Regasse had run out. You're not married, are you, Sarah? - It is safe to say that. - What'd you do before Regasse? I did an occasional man. Prostitute. We cannot all be army majors, now, canh we? Check the inventory, Jake. All complete, sir. Have all the medical supplies sent to the hospital. Superintendent Kemel, the arms to Ordnance. Of course, Major Vandam. And what would you like me to do about the lady? We haven't got any charges against her. She can stay here for now... in Cairo. Stay here? I have no money, no income, no way to support all this now that Claude is gone. What do you suggest I do? Do another man. [DOOR CLOSES] Hi, Dad. - Hi, son. - How goes the war? Oh, smashing. Smashing. The war progresses, which is more than I can say for your dinner. Did you catch any spies today, Dad? No, it was a slow spy day. Couple of thieves, some stolen military equipment, signed a few papers. That's about it. How about you? Oh, thank you, Gaafar. It's not good for the boy, sir, to eat at such irregular hours. You're right. The war mustn't interrupt his digestion. It's cold. Cold. [TUTS] Hmm. Shall we do the king? - Yeah. Nel’d - To King George. - King George. - Dad? - Mm-hm? - Can we do to Mum? - Right. To your mother. Thank you, Gaafar. I can't be keeping in kitchen all hours. And studies. What about his studies? Yeah, Bill, what about your studies, hmm? Hello. What's that? Murders in Silk? It's great, Dad, a smashing mystery. You should read it sometime. All right, I'll make a deal with you. You do your studies and I'll read the murder mystery, OK? No, Dad. I'll do my studies, Gaafar will read the mysteries, and you'll catch a spy. Do you always have to have the last word? Is cold. Cold. [TUTS] [WHISPERS] He always has to have the last word. [CHILDREN GIGGLE] [GROWLS] - Boof! - [GIGGLES] I was wondering... When we found you, your mind was wandering. You spoke of Rebecca. This person is of some importance to you? Ah, yes. Rebecca. Ishmael... This case that I leave with you, no living person is to see it. No person who sees it would live. Go with Allah. And with you. [CAR BRAKES, REVERSES] Where the devil have you come from? Unfortunate for me, my car broke down some distance back. - I've been walking all night. - My God, I think you have. I'd better see your papers, please. Alex Wolff. You live in Cairo. What are you doing up this way? I have investments in the north. I like to pay them surprise visits from time to time, make sure the caretakers are on their toes. - You know the wogs. - Only too bloody well. We'll give you a lift to Asyut. Corporal, take the man's bags for him. He looks done in. Yes, sir. Round this side, sir. - Do you have some water? - Ah, yes. There you go. I'm Captain Newman, by the way, stationed with the 17th. How do you do? Where does your accent come from? My parents were Boers. The name Wolff is Dutch. Well, we'd better get you to a decent hotel. We'd also better see that something's done about that car. - Car? -Your car. That broke down out there on the desert. Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry. I must be so tired that my brain is baked. Perfectly understandable, old man. Well, you can relax. We'll look after you. MAN: General Rommel. [SPEAKS GERMAN] Herr Feldmarschall. Guten Tag. I hope my staff has made you comfortable. Comfortable, mein liebe General? Huh! What is six hours and 43 minutes in sweltering heat in a desert tent as between friends? I'm sorry. I was fighting a battle today. I had to give my orders on the spot. Even the British generals keep in touch with their headquarters. Well, perhaps that is why they lose battles than win them. However, today you did not win, huh? I understand you are withdrawing your troops. Today the British are here, here, here and there. Everywhere. They have more men, more tanks, more ammunition, more gasoline. Every month that goes by and we have less. Still, they have more territory to protect and so they are spread out. For instance, today, we dug back behind their minefields and hit them from behind. And if I had not run out of gasoline... and ammunition, and if I knew where they had what, 1 would whip through their weakest sectors, we would be in Cairo by now. Rommel... you will not go to Cairo. That is the direct order of the Fiihrer. Would I disobey an order? Bring us some tea. And strain some of the sand out of it for the field marshal. Albert, sit down. - [CAR HORN HONKS] - [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] [HORN HONKS] There you are, Mr. Wolff. A wash-up will do you wonders. Thank you very much, Captain. I do not think I could have walked to Asyut. You still look all in. I'll leave Corporal Cox to look after you. - That won't be necessary, Captain. - Nonsense. We Europeans must keep an eye out for each other. See that Mr. Wolff gets decent quarters, Cox. Yes, sir. Then escort him to the garage and make sure a tow truck is sent after his car. This way, Mr. Wolff. Very kind, Captain. Think nothing of it. Right. Well, here you are. I'm sorry about it, but... it's as snug as you'll find in this arse end of creation. Thank you very much, Corporal. Shall we see about the car, sir? In fact, I am much too tired to bother with a garage at the moment. I should think my car would be no worse off in a few hours. If you say so. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll unpack for you. No, don't bother. I'll see to it after my nap. It's no bother. I'll take care of it in no time and then you can have a nice lie-down. Good Lord. [BELL RINGS] Cairo! Cairo! Cairo! What's up, Jake? I've taken the liberty of replacing Ibbotson in Sector Nine. - Oh? - Uh, signature, signature. Usual bumf. Colonel Bogge, as usual, wants to see you as soon as possible. There's a Captain Newman calling from Asyut about the knifing of a corporal down there. He copied us. Is it automatic with British aristocracy? - What's that? - Perfect tea every time. It's Asyut again, Sergeant. Asyut. Uh, hello, Cap... Captain Newman? Yes, sir, this is Major Vandam, Intelligence, GHQ. I see you... I see you marked this report for us. Now, why is that, Captain? I believe that the circumstances were unusual enough to warrant an intelligence copy, Major. He had papers in the name of, uh... Alex Wolff. I see. Address. . ...Villa Les Qliviers, Garden City Section, Cairo. - Any suspicion they were forgeries? - I'm sure they were real. Well, they were old. They'd seen use. Well, thanks for the information, Captain. Major, I'd be grateful for a call if you turn anything up. Cox was a good man. Goodbye, Captain. Anything? - Not really, no. - Another overtrained captain. A man is picked up on foot on the edge of the Western Desert and kills a British soldier trying to help him in Asyut. With an address in Cairo. Does that seem strange to you? There's no real shortage of Egyptians who'd welcome the chance to stab us good night, sir. - No, he's European. - True. If you were trying to come into Cairo unannounced, - which way would you come in? - Not through Asyut, sir. After all, the reason we don't cover it is that there's nothing beyond Asyut except miles of desert. Right. Ah, yes. Third finger down the seam, look down the wicket, give it a polish. One, two, three... and... [YELLS] - Ah, yes, Vandam. - Yes, sir. Now, Vandam, I want you to organize a cricket match this weekend with the Ordnance group. I have some slow googlies I haven't uncorked yet. Put Sergeant Lendenowen on it, will you? Did you see this report on Asyut, sir? Oh, yes, that. Huh. Well, I think the murder of a corporal hardly qualifies for an intelligence report, Vandam. It looks like this captain is trying to capture the eye of his superior officer, what? Possibly, sir. Except the captain doesn't come out of this looking too well. I'll... We should be concentrating on Rommel. You know he went round our southern flank and captured 7th Army headquarters last night? Yes, sir, I heard it was a shambles. I'll get on this Asyut right away. That would be a waste of your time, Major. Let the Egyptian police look after it. Now, Rommel, the cricket match with Ordnance, and not necessarily in that order. [CHUCKLES] - All right, dismissed. - Yes, sir. - Can I fix you a fresh cup of tea, sir? - No. No, thanks. I'll tell you what you can do. You can... You can set up the stumps and bumps or whatever the hell they're called and rustle up 11 idiots from Ordnance. - JAKE: Colonel Bogge's cricket match. -Yeah. JAKE: The smack of leather against willow. Yeah, sorry about that, but that's Bogge's war. Now. . Now. . Could a man, would a man, cross 400 miles of open desert on foot. .. ...just to sneak up behind me? [DOOR OPENS] - Did you find anything, sir? -\What? Did you find anything? No, not a damn thing. Not a damn thing, but I smell him. I smell him. I'll tell you what. Send a description of Wolff to every department. Put a round-the-clock watch on this house. And, Jake, I want the Egyptian police checking every hotel and flophouse. Alert the wireless listening service to check for any new local transmitters. Right, sir. Effendi. Mr. Wolff. A real pleasure. Yes, yes. How can I be of service? Where else would I find scarce delicacies, Nicos? - I trust you have not changed? - Cairo has changed. I have few items these days. The army takes everything. And for me, Nicos? I manage at great cost to secure some items. What is it that you have in mind? One dozen tins of beluga caviar. A few bottles of champagne, good house, good year. Perhaps a few other items along this line. Mr. Wolff, please, don't you realize there's a war going on? Yes, so I've heard. So, then, what I need is not available here? It's not cheap here, no. No, Nicos, you have not changed. [LAUGHS] The dance is the language for body, OK? [SPEAKS ARABIC] Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! ALL: Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! Sonja! [SLOW DRUM BEAT] [EXOTIC MUSIC] SONJA: Caviar. Mmm. You need something special to wash down that caviar? You. Get out of here. Go on. Get. It's there on the floor by the chair. [WOLFF CHUCKLES] Everything to excess, eh, Sonja? Not the slightest sense of moderation about anything. It adds excitement to your beauty. You reappear here in my dressing room after three years as if it had been three hours. - How dare you. - I had no choice. Believe that. You could have said something. And what words would have been adequate? Goodbye. You could at least have shown some respect for my feelings. I see you still have that golden necklace I sent you from Berlin. No one was to know where I was going, that I was going or what I was to do. That's very good. Now you can get out of here and keep on doing it. Or I will have the owner throw you out. Oh, Alex. Why did you leave me like that? The British are looking for me. They are checking everywhere. They have already been in my house. Well, then, let the British have you. You deserve each other. First they have to catch me, and that they will not do. - But I need your help. - Why should I help you? Because, my love, you hate the British even more than I. And together we can rid Egypt of them. At this very moment the German armies are driving the British out of the desert, and soon Rommel will be at the gates of Cairo, with our help, you and I together. Oh. Big words and big plans. [KNOCKING] SONJA: Not now. How do you afford all this anyway? Even the rich are penniless these days. I am financed by the Third Reich. SONJA: What? And now I am in Cairo to get information for Rommel. - To spy. - Are you crazy? Sonja, there are many others to whom I could have gone, Egyptian dissidents who would welcome the opportunity to overthrow the British government. And yet who but you could I trust? Look at me. I am not dangerous. Oh, yes, you are. And only you will know where I hide. In my villa. You bastard. [KNOCKING] Not now! How is Tanya? She left me. So I will have to find us another Tanya, huh? [TAPPING] [TAPPING CONTINUES] [CHUCKLES] Happy news, Rommel? One of our Berlin personnel has slipped into Cairo. Code name Rebecca. Intelligence reports are rarely accurate. Information from spies even worse. This... Danke. This, uh, Rebecca, came into Cairo from the desert, alone, on foot. If he can do that, I think perhaps he is capable of anything. Hmm! You will lose half your army to the back streets and the gutter cafés. I have better faith. If this one, any informant, can pinpoint for me where the British will try to break through, exactly just that, I will eat their armies for my lunch. Oh, Major Vandam, the sentries said you had left. I'm lucky to catch you. Superintendent Kemel, I didn't expect to see you here. I heard you wanted to see me, so I came at once. Of course, here it is always difficult. Egyptians are not always welcome. I apologize. It's just wartime stupidity and red tape. I was just wondering if you'd had any luck in locating this Alex Wolff. Oh, nothing, Major. Not a hint. My informants, they have heard not even a rumor. Do you know what I think? I think, sir, the man never reached Cairo. - You think that? - I and my officers are ever alert. If this spy dare to appear in the city, I will know, and then you will know. Well, I appreciate that. That's reassuring, Superintendent. - I am your servant, Major Vandam. - Thank you. I too am your servant, Major Vandam. Hershel. Jews make lousy servants. You know that. They argue too much. What, argue? Respond, debate, discuss. So we can talk about it. So that's an argument, huh? Come, I have something for you. Hershel, why can't you give me a simple report without all the dramatics? Everything with you people is s0, so bland. It's like your food. There's no spice. Well, the Jewish Agency is supposed to give us reports, not philosophy. And England is supposed to supply us with Palestine, not sawdust. When they give it to me, I'll hand it over to you, all right? You're not gonna buy me a drink, are you? You told me you need ears among the people, the kind that might be able to hear things, to work for you. Such a person came to my office today. This person wants to go to Palestine. Maybe I thought, between you and this person, there could be a... huh? Major Vandam, you should meet... Elene Fontana. Oh, you do not insist on Sarah Askenazy today, Major? HERSHEL: Ah. You two know each other, huh? I'm surprised you did not ask the maijor for help. The major's job is to hurt people, not to help them. The major's job is to help stop the Germans from winning the war. Nothing else. I'll say a few words and then I will go away. Surala, you wish to go to Palestine. Now, this man can get the papers for you. Major, you want people on the streets so you'll know that while your soldiers face a German bullet from in front, they are not brought down by an Egyptian knife from behind. She's a beautiful woman, the sort in whose presence men become... careless, hmm? I leave you to make a shidduch. OK, Miss Askenazy, Fontana, whatever. Let's assume for the moment we can help each other, as one professional to the other. Just so that we understand that my profession is not prostitution. - What is it? - Actually, I am a bad singer. And a mediocre dancer. And sometimes I find a rich man to pay my bills. - Are you shocked? - Should I be? Is that not what most women do when they marry? - Find a man to pay the bills? -lsit? Actually, I just turn them around a little bit faster than the average housewife. OK. Cairo's filled with officers and men with a lot of secrets. They know our strengths and our weaknesses . You can be damn sure the Germans have got people trying to get that information. My job is to see they don't get it. Well, I certainly can go places in the city where a uniform cannot. I wanna know everything you saw, everything you heard. - If we had an arrangement. - Such as? I need rent money, food money. - And I want to get to Palestine. - How much for your apartment? - 75 a month. - Well, you gotta prove you're worth it. All right. We'll give it a trial. I'm particularly interested in a man named... Alex Wolff. Did you ever hear of him? - No. - OK. Here's my card. My address is on the back. Home address. To espionage, then. And you know where I live. If you come, you bring flowers and chocolates. People will think you are visiting your mistress and not your informant. That's how it's done, huh? Well, you should bring jewelry, but anyone who balks at 75 a month better start with flowers. Thank you, Major. Thank you. BILL: "Lacey moaned from her bed, her breasts heaving through the gossamer silk of her nightgown." "Don't hurt him, Moxie." "Moxie's eyes slitted to Phil, who was firing the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth.” That Phil Scott, some cool customer. "You're some cool customer, all right." "What are you doing in my wife's bedroom?" "Isn't this where the Grant Street trolley stops?" - Oh, hi, Dad. You're home early. - Mm-hm. Yeah, I took the Grant Street trolley. Oh, sir, a few moments more, young man's light would have been out. It should have been out 25 minutes ago, Gaafar. If this happens again, I may tear out the last ten pages of the book. Oh, sir, you wouldn't do that. We would never know who stole the Kimberly Jade. It was either Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre or an Egyptian butler I know. But there is no Egyptian butler. Oh. [TUTS] Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy. What am I gonna do with you two incorrigibles, huh? I'm sorry, Dad. I'll have to try harder. Mm-hm. You know, it's not really fair to take advantage. You know that. You mean if Mum were alive, she'd be making sure I behaved? No, that's not exactly what I meant. Come on, lights out. You miss Mum as much as I do, don't you? I do miss her, yeah. Night. You loved each other very much, didn't you? Yes, I did love her. And she loved you too, Dad, didn't she? Good night, Bill. To my love. Café. When do we stop talking and act? Soon. With the help of the Germans, the British will be finished. Oh. And so we have the Germans trumping for us. No. The Germans need allies. We shall be those allies. It is the only way we could ever negotiate for the return of our country to us. We shall let it be known in certain quarters that we exist, that we can be ready... ...and that we wish to negotiate with Berlin. So, the Egyptians conspiring against the British. Save your weapons for the enemy, wherever you may find him. Which one of you is Superintendent Kemel? - And who are you? -] am from Berlin. Alex Wolff. Half of Cairo is looking for you. Superintendent Kemel. Only half? I am disappointed. In particular a Major Vandam. British Intelligence. Presumably the man who violated my home. I have been asked to evaluate your group, its numbers, its ability to support Berlin... when Germany takes Egypt. - And will it? - With my help, yes. He leaves for his office every morning at this hour. Does he live with anyone else? There is a son, William, ten years old, raised in England before moving to Egypt, and a servant named Gaafar. - Wife? - Dead. She died in a Luftwaffe bombing raid on the island of Crete. You're very well informed about this man, Kemel. An American who chooses to join the British is something of a rarity. But I should know more about you, Mr. Wolff. I need some assurance that you are able to contact Berlin. All things are possible. Is it imperative for our group that we make some arrangements. Negotiations with Berlin, Hitler, Rommel. And of course you must show them how useful you can be. Where can we contact you? We cannot be seen together. You don't. I contact you. Now, I have an appointment. Would you be kind enough to drop me? - Of course. Where? - British military headquarters. That is where they keep all the secrets of the British Empire. The secrets of the Middle East Command at least. And you have come back to steal them, Achmed? Only just a few, Abdullah. Of course, I would not think of stealing anything in Cairo without first turning to the master of all the thieves in the city. [CHUCKLES] Not all the thieves, Achmed. Let's say the thieves of any consequence. But you had something special in mind when you asked me to meet you here? Ah, yes. You see those officers there, their insignias, commanding general staff? Every morning the command staff meet for a briefing across there, after which the staff members take their orders and their papers to their offices elsewhere. Like those three officers there. I want you to steal one of those briefcases. - Which one? - Doesn't matter. This is an experiment. Just choose your place in the square and make your arrangements. But, dear friend, do it soon. Tomorrow. Inshallah. [INDISTINCT] [SHOUTING IN ARABIC] [SHOUTING IN ARABIC] My briefcase. Flowers, darling. For me? How sweet. Oh, yeah, well, I was just... just in the neighborhood, and I, you know, brought these, um... You are such a dear. Come in. We'll have an aperitif. Yeah. This, Major, is a posy. It is for smelling and sniffing and as such quite charming, but as a lover's disguise quite hopeless. OK. Perhaps that is the military problem. You all think of women as Red Cross uniforms and teapots, and we are not. OK, what did you call me about? Well, last night I was out on a date and there was a lot of chatter about what had happened outside of British headquarters in the square. Everyone was laughing because apparently it was an organized thing set up by a thief called Abdullah. - Do you know him? - Uh, yeah, I've heard of him, yeah. - Go ahead. - Well, not much else. I called you because there were British officers involved. Yeah, I heard a couple of our officers were roughed up a little bit. - One of them lost his briefcase. - Well, that is the joke. Abdullah got a load of wallets for himself as a bonus, but actually he was paid to make the riot happen to cover up for something else. Something else? Briefcase. Staff officer's briefcase. Possibility. - Possibility. - So... can I stay? Where's that aperitif? Salaam alaik, Achmed. [LAUGHS] What a success. [SPEAKS ARABIC] Success indeed... for you. - For me? - Yes, I saw your boys in the crowd. - Picking pockets. - But of course. I don't go to all that trouble to steal a little briefcase. But what a joy, huh? What fun. Did you see the man eat fire? Yes. I also saw one officer who could not find his briefcase. - May I have it, please? - But of course. If, um... if you will first give me the extra 50 pounds you promised. But of course. Shukran. You have opened it already. [SPEAKS ARABIC] But look. Go on, look. Look. See what I've stolen for you. See the top secrets of the British high command. Now you know everything, Achmed. Now you know the exact weight of every morsel of food that will pass the lips of every British soldier. The barracks' menus for the entire month. [LAUGHS] That's it. [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Shepheard's Hotel is off limits for business discussions, Major. - There are rules, you know. - I realize that, sir. I just thought this was important. Well, if I heard you correctly, this Abdullah's wanting our canteen menus? I think, Colonel, he was trying to steal secret papers, and I think he was being paid by Alex Wolff, who I think is in Cairo, and I think he is a threat to our military security. - That's what I think, Colonel. -Oh. And this from some tart informant you hired, hmm? That's part of my job, Colonel. Street robberies are the job of the Egyptian police. The situation's quite bad enough without our treading on their toes. Colonel, this is our job too. This is a matter of military security. You don't think the Egyptian police are gonna arrest Abdullah? Too many of their officers are getting rich with their bribes already. Don't you lecture me, laddie. Wogs don't even know how to put a decent olive into a martini. They still try and blame us for the shortage of gin. Perhaps we should start bribing them. We do, Colonel. Didn't you know? Colonel, let me pull Abdullah in. Let me sweat him out. General staff intelligence doesn't pull wogs in and sweat them, Major. Remember the politics. So drop it, Vandam. Drop it. Yes, sir. Thanks for the drink. No. [LAUGHS] I don't want food. I want... Tanya. Well, if you don't want pété de foie gras, there's no point in any going to waste. Never mind, you pig. [WOLFF CHUCKLES] Mmm! Mmm. Where do you find these things? Just enjoy yourself, darling. By the by, I found a way to get into the staff briefcases. With the help of an Egyptian policeman. I'm going to select a member of the British GHQ staff. Someone very close to the commander in chief. .. ...and make him my friend. - My very close friend. - How will you do that? By offering him something that he will not be able to refuse. What? You. - No. - Oh, yes. Why should I? Because you hate them... ...and you love me. [CHUCKLES] No, no. No. [BOTH LAUGH] JAKE: Major. Major. - A hit. A palpable hit. - \Wolff? - He's made his second mistake, Major. -\What? The alert we sent the paymaster to look out for forged sterling. - Yeah? - Quite a lot has turned up. Hot damn. Hot damn. Now, if we can link these up with German presses... All right, give me that file on forged bank notes. - There it is, sir. - Where? Oh, thanks. - Do you think I should just tidy this up? - No, don't mess with my mess. Just dig me out some made-in-Germany English five-pound notes. And... we shall compare. Thank you. Now. . Ah. The P. - No. - Oh, no. The D. No. Ah. - The foot. - The foot? On Britannia. See the smudge? Yes. That, plus the water mark. That's Nazi money, all right. You'd think they'd know better. Espionage is an expensive business. They counterfeit passports. Why not money? Still, you'd think they'd cotton on to the fact that we're catching their buggers this way. Yes, well, we don't tell them that, do we? No, that's true. Now Bogge can't blink away the fact that we've got the evidence. KEMEL: Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you this evening, Major. I'm sorry I wasn't able to provide you with a drink. No. Work all the time. Well, please enjoy the rest of your evening. I'll certainly try, Superintendent. Thank you. Scotch, please. Cap off in the bar, Captain. Oh, thank you, Major. My mind was somewhere else. Oh, sweating like a pig. Bloody weather. Yes, it is, isn't it? Cigarette? No, I never use them, actually. - I'm Smith, by the way. GHQ. - Oh. How do you do? - Slavenburg. BTE, sir. - You can ease up on the sirs too. No bull in the bar, eh? And personally I wouldn't put water with the Scotch. They say it comes straight from the Nile, you know. Well, then, I must be used to it, sir. Cheers. You've got no gippy tummy? You must be the only white man in the whole of Egypt who doesn't. I was born in South Africa. Been in Cairo for... ten years. If you've lived in Cairo for ten years, you must know somewhere better to go in the evenings than this blasted bar. Short-range Shepheard's group, what? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Have you... Have you seen belly dancing? It's some fat wog woggling her behind, isn't it? Well, then, obviously you've not seen the real thing. Real belly dancing is... bloody exotic. It will have you crawling right out of your chair. - Is that right? - Quite. As a matter of fact, I was planning to visit such a place tonight. A place called the Cha Cha Club. Perhaps you'd like to join me. Well, that's very sporting of you. [EXOTIC MUSIC] Fantastic! Fantastic! I'll go back and see if the girl'll join us. Worth a try. [LAUGHS] Yeah! Sonja, allow me to introduce Major Smith. Maijor, Sonja. Enchanted. Enchanted to meet you. I thought your dance was absolutely art... artistic. Very kind, Major. I must say, you do wear a European gown beautifully. Thank you, Major. And you wear the English officer's uniform perfectly. I do wish you'd call me Sandy. Of course... Sandy. Ah, well, Major, I must be up early tomorrow morning. So if you'll excuse me, please. May I escort you home, Sonja? No, no, no, I'm more than happy... happy to do that, that is if Sonja doesn't mind. Of course not, Sandy. Very well, then. Major. Sonja. Thank you, Slavenburg. Enjoy. Well... To.. To new friendships. To warm friendships. VANDAM: Hello? Ah, good morning, sir. - As-salamu. - Salaam. You own this shop? Nicos Aristopulos at your service. Two days ago you took 147 English pounds to the British paymaster in exchange for Egyptian currency, right? Yeabh, of course. This is the way of the honest merchant, no? Whoa, sir, please, please... Hello. I haven't seen these items since Harrods, '39. Champagne. Please take it. Oh, and allow me to send a case to your billet. Black marketing can get you a lot of time in the hole. Not to mention passing counterfeit currency. Counterfeit? I know nothing of counterfeit. Tell me about the man that gave you that currency. He was European, right? Sometimes. Other times he comes as an Arab. Oh, he buys only the best. He has lots of money. - Alex Wolff. - Yes. Yes, that is the very man. - Mm-hm. I deliver to his home. -Where? The Vil ... - The... Villa Les Oliviers. -Ah. - That is where he lives. - Not any more. Well, not lately. Well, when do you expect him back? Whenever he runs out of champagne, or... whatever. You need help. I'm gonna get you a clerk. But, sir, British soldiers will frighten away my customers. It won't be a soldier. It'll be a woman. How dare you leave messages this morning for that worm Smith to come here. I loathe him. Oh, his touch is like... slime. Listen, darling, I want you to bring him here. - I won't! - Like you did last time. Sonja, don't be difficult. This is important to me. You canhot make me. No, true. But if you fail me... ...l will surely slice off your lovely lips. You do not love me. Why are you so terrible to me? Oh, Sonja, I love you, desperately. But I have other desperate needs. Hmm? So, the time is set for noon. Major Smith will have no time to go to his office from the staff meeting. He will be carrying with him a briefcase, in which briefcase will be the notes from that meeting. Now, I want you to be sure... ...that he puts his blouse and his briefcase right there close to the dressing room, hmm? Does it mean nothing to you that I despise this man and all like him? Of course it does. And that is why you must do it. It is your chance to avenge yourself against the British. Don't you see, for a man like Smith, you, Sonja, are the unattainable dream? Make him crawl to you... not away. Really, my dear, you must not leave messages for me at the office. It's just that it's... it's not right. I had to be with you. I dreamt of you all night. Really? Really? Well, I... I dreamed of you too, but it's just that it's so early. - You see... - I could not wait. I need you. - This fine, strong body. - Ooh. No. The strength of your arms as you draw me in. Be... Be gentle, my d... Be gentle. Be... gentle. SONJA: It's perfect. My maid does not come until one, and we have. .. [BOTH MOANING] _an hour all to ourselves. Oh, Sandy. [SMITH GROANS] - SONJA: Yes. - Don't bite. Don't bite. SONJA: Yes. Yes. SMITH: Be gentle. - Gentle. -Yes. WOLFF: Assault. .. From west and south. Forces consist of one 24th armored battalion deployed... I'm sorry, Major, but I was passing and saw your lights on. That's all right. Can I fix you a drink? Oh, thank you, Major, but I've sort of got a young lady waiting in the car. Oh? You sort of got her, or she's sort of waiting? What's up? Wireless listening service stumbled across this signal at 13:20 KCs. Oh, yeah? What time did this come in? Midnight, on the button. Probably his check-in time. As you see, it starts in the clear, Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca. And then it goes into absolute gibberish. Mmm. Looks like a one-time notepad. No way to break this without the key. - OK, give it to the code boys. - What do you think, Major? Wolff? I don't know. I think we can pin up three cards for Mr. Wolff, though. One... he uses his radio at midnight. Two, he sets it at 13:20 KC crystal, and three. . ...his code name just might be... Rebecca. What are you doing here? Qur battle plans are formed. We really cannot plan battles on the basis of rumors picked up from some grubby little spy in Cairo. I respect your advice. The Fuhrer has given me carte blanche to commit the Afrika Korps when, where and how I see fit. Colonel, what signs confirm? The British 32nd Tank Brigade has just been moved to Rigel Ridge. Now, this a logical position from which to attack Sidra Ridge. This afternoon we picked up a low-grade cipher from an Indian brigade requesting clarification of orders for an artillery bombardment. I assume. .. ...that they will hit us at dawn, June 5th, as Rebecca has signaled. Let us deal then with Operation Aberdeen. Qur engineers tonight clear a gap... —in the minefield at Bir-el Harmat so the 15th Panzers can swing south through the gap tomorrow and attack the British from the rear. If all goes as planned, the British will be surrounded, cut off and... wiped out, leaving us a clear path... ...all the way to Tobruk. Oh, what lovely flowers. They really are beautiful. Oh, and, uh... You certainly rate a kiss for that. [FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS] Oh, uh, let us not stand out here in the hallway. Oh. Now, this is more like it. The champagne was a particularly nice touch. You really like this stuff? Oh, I love reading thrillers. Anyhow, won't it teach me how a spy is supposed to behave? Not exactly, no. Oh, joke. OK. You really should have chilled this, you know. Yeah, I... I know. Elene, I'll tell you why I came here today. I wanna send you on an assignment. Remember that spy, Alex Wolff, who I was telling you about? - Yes. Nel’d - I wanna send you. - What will you do if you catch him? They'll probably hang him. They usually do. But I... And you do not care? My job is to catch ‘em, not to kill ‘em. Whatever happens to ‘'em after that is not my business. Oh. You are very hard, Major. Elene, those are the rules of war. I didn't make 'em. Anyway, maybe you have to be hard to make the war end. Anyway, there's this grocer, a Greek grocer named Aristopulos. Alex Wolff frequents his store. I wanna put you in as a clerk. When Wolff comes in, Avristopulos will alert you. And then what do I do? Do I leap over the counter and fell him with a sack of sugar? No. It's not a joke. I want you to get to meet him, be nice to him, make friends with him. Find out where he's staying. What do you mean, make friends? Just that. Be good to him, whatever. [SIGHS] I have told you I am not a prostitute. Elene, soldiers kill people during the war and they're not murderers. I'm asking you to find out where he's staying and do just what you have to do. Blame it on the war. Well... I guess it is no worse than other things I've had to do in my life. I suppose so. Hey... I'm sorry. So am I. This is it, sir. It certainly looks like the Rommel communication post. Yeah. This is what we're looking for. This is good. - The buggers really caught it, eh? - Poor blighters. Jake, get some boxes. Let's get all this stuff sent back to Cairo right away. JAKE: Right you are, sir. They're getting louder, Vandam. Jerry'll soon be here. Not to worry, Colonel. This is the one sector our forces held, thanks to the Aussies. Let's take a look. Soldier, here, to me. Come and help the sergeant. [EXPLOSION] That was a close one, Sergeant. JAKE: Well, I imagine the Jerries must be at least ten kilometers off, Colonel. My God. Vandam... this is the message we intercepted decoded into English at this end. Sergeant, look. "The British will attack on the fifth. It'll be a two-pronged assault.” Rommel's getting all his facts in advance. No wonder our troops are being massacred. JAKE: Bloody hell. Well, this information can only have come from a British officer. - Yes. - What do you mean, yes? You are responsible for personnel security. Do you realize what a leak of this proportion means? This is your responsibility. Jake. "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again." Jesus. This is it. What are you talking about, Vandam? You remember the coded message we picked off the air last week signed Rebecca? Yes. Well, go on, Sergeant. All due respects, Colonel, every code book has a key. Different key, different message, different text. Very well. Well, we have got the name of the spy. Now, all we need is the code book and the key. All we need is the key, Colonel. We've got the book. [AIRPLANES FLY OVERHEAD] [EXPLOSION] Guten Morgen, Feldmarschall. [SPEAKS GERMAN] Field Marshal Kesselring has done it. He has the Luftwaffe delivering a devastating attack as promised. No thanks to Kesselring. We give orders to the Luftwaffe today, thank God. [EXPLOSION] Look, sir, there's the signal from the assault engineers for the artillery to lengthen their barrage. Ja, good, we make progress. Ah. In Tobruk, there is fresh fish for supper. Liver, fried potatoes, fresh bread. And a real bed with a feather pillow. - And a toast to Rebecca. -Ja. They've cut the wire at strongpoint 68. Group Menny is attacking now with infantry. That's it. We have a gap. Let's go through it. - BOGGE: Vandam? - Yes, sir. Where's that report from Tobruk? I asked for it half an hour ago, damn it. We can't reach 'em, Colonel. What do you mean, you can't reach them? - We have a direct line. - The line's been cut, sir. Well, send a messenger round. Send a speedboat round into the harbor. Use your imagination. Colonel, there's a battle going on out there. You know that. Oh, I know that. But what do you do when I ask for information of the battle? You go into a trance over your master Boche spy. For God's sake, man, where's your sense of priorities? Sir... Tobruk has fallen. Where'd you get that information, Sergeant? Major Vandam told me to call the RAF. Their observers report German tanks and troops all through the city. Qur troops are surrendering, sir. I'm sorry, sir. My God. Get your cup, Jake. To all the idiots, incompetents and madmen who wage war and consider themselves exalted, God bless us all. Hi, Dad. I was looking for Tobruk on the map. Teacher said the Germans are there. Does that mean that they're near? Yeah. Practically at the garden gates, Bill. Soon they'll be looking for Gaafar and the silver. - Are you swoggled, Dad? - Swoggled? What kind of a word is that? Swoggled. Oh, if you'd learned your lessons instead of reading all those mystery novels, you might have come up with a better word than that, Bill. Try, uh, crocked. That's a pretty good word. Stewed, fried, tight. The ever elegant pissed. And dead drunk. That's premature, but it comes later. - Has it been a bad day, Dad? - [CHUCKLES] Disastrous. Try... Try cataclysmic. But you'll fix it right again. You always do. Oh, Billy. Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy. The fact is, your father's failed, and there's no other word for that. Dad? Dad, don't, please. I'm frightened. Don't you be frightened, Bill. Don't you be frightened. I'll never let anything happen to you ever, ever. I'm S I'm just tired, that's all, very tired. I knew it was something like that. Right. - You just need to get to bed. - Mm-hm. You too, huh? You go on up and I'll tuck you in in a little while, OK? - See? You're feeling better already. - Right. In the morning you'll go out and catch all those spies, and we'll go back to America and have a proper home again. Right, right. - How goes the war? - Smashing. Just smashing. [SIGHS] Smashing. Smashing. [MUMBLES] If you touch me one more time, you greasy pig, you will be singing soprano. Please, I would not like to sing above tenor. And what do you want? Nicos, you greasy pig, what are you doing to this girl? Oh, uh, I'll be with you in a moment. - This is my niece. - Niece? Look here, is there something you want? What a leading question. Shall we start with some... English marmalade? It is in the back. - It's him. Him, him, him. - What are you talking about? The bad money man, that's him, Mr. Wolff. Oh, my God. Oh. Will that be all, sir? I could use a half a case of champagne. It is right here. I expect you would like us to deliver this order? No, thank you. That won't be necessary. I think that will be all. How much? Let me see. Aristopulos must be doing very well to employ an assistant. Well, you would not say that if you know what he pays me. So you don't like your job? I would do anything to get out of here. Anything? Thirteen pounds, ten shillings and four pence. How did you know that I would be paying in British sterling? You are a British officer, are you not? Very astute. Keep the change. All this champagne... You must be having a party. I love patrties. All of life is a party. Cheerio. And you are sure you do not want help with that? Yes, I'm quite sure. But if you like parties, meet me tomorrow night at the Oasis restaurant at 6:30. Goodbye. I hope you found everything to your satisfaction. - Superb. -Mmm. I want some more of these cakes. Of course. It's always an honor to have the greatest dancer in all of Cairo grace my humble establishment. Another one of those cakes, Ibrahim, and you'll be graced by the fattest dancer in all of Cairo. It's quiet here tonight. People are staying home tonight. Worried about this news of terrible British defeat. - Ah, yes. - Everyone is frightened. Ah, well. Rumors, huh? - Life goes on. - How true, Effendi. I'll send madam her cakes and bring your change. So, now you think I'm fat. Just a joke, my love. I think that you are the loveliest woman in all of Cairo, when you're not fussing with your hair or pouting. Oh, come, now. We are here to celebrate the defeat of enemies, huh? I have a mind to throw you out of my villa. And then what will you do to look into Sandy's briefcases? You really must stop threatening me, Sonja. If I were to take you seriously, we might both regret what follows. Well, you don't care about me, about my needs. You promised to find me another Tanya, and have you? As a matter of fact... I think I have. - You have? Where is she? - Softly, dear. I must first be sure of her. A little shop girl I met this morning. A most delicious smile. And a very promising body. When can I have her? We must not rush into these things, Sonja. I have a date with her tomorrow night. If I find her suitable, I will bring you in at the proper time. All right? [PHONE RINGS] Yeah? Yeah. Ibrahim's? - You're sure? - I'm quite sure, Major. The proprietor compared the five-pound notes with the flyer you had us circulate, and he's positive that they're counterfeit. A couple of MPs are on their way to Ibrahim's restaurant right now to pick up the party. A couple of MPs? We need a squad for this man, on the double. I'm on my way, yeah. When the Germans win, I expect at least a palace from you. Oh, you shall have your palace, my love, and ... I will be... ...Hitler's ambassador to Egypt, hmm? And wear my SS uniform to the mosque? [LAUGHS] You'd have to take off your jackboots. And when I visit you at your palace? Everything else. But not the boots. What is taking so long? I am sorry, Effendi, but I had to send out for change in sterling. It will be but a few moments. Accept a glass of my most excellent brandy. - With my compliments. -Ah. You're very gracious. I am getting quite bored with this waiting. I don't like it. Let's go. I'm so sorry, but it shouldn't be much longer. - Keep the change. - Just a few moments. - Perhaps another brandy? - No, thank you. We must go. - May I call you a taxi? - No, we'll walk, thank you. You can't go. The money you gave for your bill, it's not good. The money is counterfeit. What are you talking about? Are you the one who called about some counterfeit sterling? - There was no need to call the police. - It's an offense to pass counterfeit. 1 did not know it was counterfeit, Corporal. See here. I will pay the bill by check. And tomorrow I will turn the notes over to the paymaster, and if they are forgeries, I will surrender them. - I prefer cash, if you please. - Oh, stop all this nonsense. I have Egyptian money. 1 will pay the bill and we can all go home. I'm afraid you'll have to come with us all the same. Why? The bill is being paid properly. My orders are to bring anyone in for questioning in relation to forged money. [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARS] [ENGINE STOPS] [ENGINE STOPS] WOLFF: Abdullah. Achmed, my dear friend. What an unexpected surprise. We've been looking for you, me, the police, all over Cairo, ever since some little trouble, was it, you had at Ibrahim's restaurant some hours ago. How did you know that so quickly? Not a leaf falls from the tree but Abdullah hears it touch the ground. Abdullah knows everything. Then you must also know that I need a safe place for the night. Now, if you would grant me your hospitality for this night, surely Allah would bless you, and, of course... I insist that you accept this small gift in return. What jokes you do play with me. Here, my sweet little Fatima. You take the good English pounds sterling of my friend Achmed. You take. Play with them. [CHUCKLES] You know, Fatima, once before I did this man a service, and he paid me with the same money. It's counterfeit. You know, Achmed, there are some men who would feel hurt, even insulted, to be played such tricks, but not Abdullah, no. Abdullah is made of larger stuff. You are my friend. You are welcome in my house for as long as you need. And I'm sure that when you have the proper means, you will wipe out this insult. My dear friend, Abdullah, I appreciate your generosity. And in truth I did not know that the money that I was giving was counterfeit. But that does not alter what I know that you will do. As surely as the moon follows the sun, you will now sell me to the British. Ah, yes. Business is business. [SCREAMING] I pray that you have earned a place close to the feet of the prophet Muhammad. What is this? Why have they brought me here? JAKE: We just want to ask you a few questions. Full name. Sonja el-Aram. If you were Egyptian, you would have known that. Who's Alex Wolff? - Did he do that to you? -Who is he? A wealthy patron of the Cha Cha Club. Wealthy in forged currency. How'd you meet him, Sonja? How else? He comes to watch me dance. - What's your address? - You have a room somewhere? Villa Jihan, Zamalek. It is in a quiet neighborhood. Do you take Wolff there? Unfortunately your intervention could not provide that opportunity. How old are you? Is that an example of British manners? All right, let's stop playing games, Sonja. No, you stop playing games. By tomorrow morning half of Cairo will know that the British have put Sonja in jail with no reason, and there will be a riot. My people will burn the city and you will have to bring your soldiers back from the desert to deal with this. We'll deal with it. - She's quite the prima donna. - As you say, sir. I don't believe her for one minute. But she's right, though. We can't do anything. We can't hold her. What we can do, though, is put a surveillance on her villa. I'll round up a couple of our men, sir. No, don't think it's a good idea. I don't think Bogge would allow that. Tell you what, contact Superintendent Kemel. - Ask him to put some of his men on it. - Consider it done, sir. You do good work. Anybody ever tell you that? My nanny did once, sir, but it's nice to have it verified. - Is your shoulder OK? - Oh, yeah, yeah, it's still there. Good. Alex. How did you get here? Don't you realize they must be watching my villa? They are watching your villa, my love, under the loyal and dedicated direction of Superintendent Kemel. A great honor to meet you, mademoiselle. - You are a policeman? - KEMEL: An Egyptian policeman. Have you been arrested? Mr. Wolff contacted me to see if I could suggest some place where he might avoid tonight's little problem. He thought the best place might be right here with you, under the friendly eyes of selected Egyptian policemen. You see my dear, Mr. Kemel, like yourself, is counting the hours until Egypt is rid of the British tyrant. Naturally I shall report that nothing suspicious occurs here, mademoiselle. When this is finished, I must thank Major Vandam. Preferably before I kill him. You will be the one killed if you use any more stupid tricks like using forged currency. Damned Abwehr penny pinchers, they gave me those bills. By God, somebody will be garroted for this when I return to Berlin. Speaking of Berlin, you won't forget our arrangement? How could I, my friend? When my work is finished, I will turn my radio over to you. Rommel has his listening posts attuned to my crystal. They will relay you directly to Berlin. Come along. I do not love you. You do not love me. - I do not love you. - You do not love me. But you know what I need. I know what you need. You know what I need. I told you, I've found her. I'll start work on her tomorrow. All right? Hmm? You do not love me. Ah. [LAUGHS] [INDISTINCT] There are 12 men and two RACs in place outside, six men and four RACs in place inside, not counting us. - She's just arrived. - How does she look? JAKE: Absolutely incredible. Her nerves, Jake. How does she look? - Very cool, sir. -What time is it now? 6:17. He's not due for 13 minutes, assuming he has the German penchant for preciseness. [INDISTINCT] - She wants to know what to do. -What time is it now? 7:16. He's 46 minutes late. Stay put. Sure you got the right time? Yes, Major, I am sure. You know it's damn important I stop this man. You know that. What about the rest of the British army? You make it sound like a personal conflict. Itis. Did he hurt you? No. I fell off my motorcycle. Not very heroic, is it? - I'm sorry. - No, it's all right. But... I must say, I prefer you in civilian clothing. You look less formidable. You're very lovely. I knowv. You've been told that before, right? But not quite so abruptly. Is this the first time you've looked at me? No, no. Why? This is a... strange conversation. Sure as hell is. I think I better take you back to your house. I think you'd better. I'll just tell Jake to send the troops onh home. Won't be a minute. And I will stop a cab for us. [SPEAKS ARABIC] WOLFF: Mademoiselle... in here. I thought you were not coming. Well, I'm sorry that I'm late, but the unexpected arose. But we still have the best part of the evening ahead of us. Please, come in. But the Oasis. .. Ah, yes. Well, I have a far better place. [SPEAKS ARABIC] - Where is she? - I think that car picked her up. Jesus. Damn. Damn! One of our men is bound to have got the number of the taxi. How did it happen? I mean, did he see our men? - How the hell did it happen? - Oh, God. I don't know. It all happened so fast. Maybe it was just caution. Unless he knows she's working for us. Oh, God help her. God help her. You arrive almost an hour late, you snatch me into a taxi and drive me off to God knows where. I do not like this at all. Now, take me home. I am sorry, and you have every right to be annoyed. I certainly do. I do not know your name, what you do or where you live. Why should I be here with a man I know absolutely nothing about? So let us start again. As for me, you may call me Alex. As for what I do... I have... money to burn, in a manner of speaking. And as to where I live, should we... [CHUCKLES] ...should we find pleasure in our company, I will bring you to my home. Nowv, as for you. My name is Elene Fontana. Not a very Greek name for the niece of Aristopulos. It is a stage name. Champagne? Uh... I am on the stage, or at least trying to get there. Ah. And as to where I live, should we find pleasure in the company of each other, I will bring you to my home. There's nothing more you can do, Major. I'll call you if anything turns up. Don't worry about waking me. I'll be up. You'd do better to get some sleep. Every available police and military unit is out looking for that taxi and its occupants. - We'll find them. - Thanks, Jake. [DOOR CLOSES] Hi, Dad. Young man... that's one book that's off limits, OK? - Why? What's it about? - Rebecca? Oh, Rebecca’s about a young girl who marries a widower. And. . a widower is. .. A man whose wife's dead. Right. Right. Anyway, their... their relationship is affected by... by the memory of his first wife. It sounds complicated. It must be true to life. Yeah, you could say that. Who burned the book, Dad? Someone who didn't like the story? No, it was a German soldier, actually. Evidently they were using it for code and didn't want us to get our hands on it. Really? Wow! But you've got the book now, haven't you? So you know the key. Well, not exactly. You see, the way it works is the sender has a copy of a book, receiver has a copy of the same book, but there is a key, and it's usually on a slip of paper, and without that key, even though we intercept the message, it doesn't do us any good, see? See? So we have to find the piece of paper with the key on it, right? Right, and I wish we had you oh our staff. Right. WOLFF: I first came here when I was a boy. My parents were Europeans working in Egypt. While I was still very young, my father died and my mother remarried an Egyptian. A lawyer, very important. Later, when I had grown up, when the city would become oppressive... ...l would come here to this place, this bridge. My way back to the desert. You see, for me, restrictions are the most terrifying things of life. Have you none? Only imprisonment. If ever I were locked up in ajail cell... ...l would surely go mad. In that case, you must lead a very careful, lawful life. [CHUCKLES] Who do you favor, Alex, European mother or Egyptian father? The best of both. Interesting, this. I have revealed more to you than is known by most of my intimate friends. That is flattering. I am comfortable with you, Elene. And yet I know little or nothing about you. Believe me, Alex, there is little or nothing to know. What do you want from life? I want... to be safe. What do you want? I want power. The power to rebuild this bridge, my bridge. May we both find what we want. May we both take what we want. We will do this again. I would like that. [SPEAKS ARABIC] Isn't that the taxi we're looking for? Lights. We'll pick that man up. You follow the cab. - Where is he? - Are you going to shoot me? - Where is he? - Alex got out at the Sharia Abbas. - How long ago? - About ten minutes. All right. Sorry we frightened you. You cannot know how glad I am to see you. - What's up? -We've had a dash of luck. An Egyptian police patrol under a British officer spotted Wolff leaving the cab. The officer and a policeman went after him. By now they've either got him or he's scarfed. Take the driver down. See if you can get any information. I'll see what I can learn from the lady. - Right you are, sir. -We'll never catch him. - Why do you say that? - I know him now. He is not the kind of man to be picked up in the streets. Halt! Stop or I'll shoot! [GUNSHOT] 2Zwei, drei, vier... _sechs. . So you never saw his place? No, just to that bridge. It is quite beautiful, actually. Oh, yeah? What's he like? He is charming, intelligent. He is... dangerous. - Does he wanna see you again? -Yes. Good. I hope he does. A few hours ago you seemed glad he had not shown up. But he did. What do you suppose he wants to see you for? Well, I should think that was obvious. Most men find me attractive. You seemed to think that Alex would want to take me home to bed. Alex? Hmm. Must have been awfully good champagne... and a long stroll. Get out of here before you make me very angry with you. - Why are you upset? - Because this is ridiculous. You asked me to do a job at whatever the cost, and now that I have done it, you're acting like a... a jealous lover. [DOOR CLOSES] Yes, I think you are. VANDAM: Fragmentation grenade. Wolff could have picked it up oh our side of the line. Do you suppose that whoever's supplying him with headquarters' secrets is also arming him? I don't know. But I do know they could kill more of our men with those secrets than all the arms in Cairo. We need another good break, a decent lead. What about, uh, Sonja? Any activity around her house? Well, according to Superintendent Kemel, she only leaves her house to dance and then returns. Uh-huh. Might be a good idea to see that she doesn't make any detours. - I'll undertake that chore, Major. -Oh? You sure you're up to it, watching belly dancing? Well, sir, can't dump all the dirty jobs onh the enlisted man. No, that's right. Good man. SMITH: Really, my dear, we must... we must try and make these arrangements for the evening. I barely have time to get through the staff meetings in the mornings. I am being selfish. Perhaps we should stop seeing each other. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, really, my dear. It's. .. It's so wonderful. tis... Itis so... so wonderful. [SMITH GROANING] [WOLFF MUMBLES] SONJA: Yes. Darling. Darling. Yes. [MOANS] Sandy. I'm sorry, sir. You left orders to be shown any communication from Rebecca the instant it arrived. Ja. Look. Look. New British defense line. Matruh to Sidi Hamza. Disposition 10th Corps. Minefields. My God. 1st Armoured Division. Second New Zealand, fresh from Syria. - He has done it. - Again. Again. This will give us Cairo and all of North Africa. - Good evening, madam. - As-salamti. I must see Major Vandam. My name is Elene Fontana. Major not yet return home, madam. May I wait, then? It is most important. You may wait here, madam. My name is Gaafar. Please call me if there is something you require. Thank you very much. That's not a very good book. It's about some silly girl and a blighted marriage. There's no action. You do not need action for a good book. There is suspense and romance and much you will appreciate as you age. I'm Elene Fontana, by the way. I'm William Vandam II. Just call me Billy. - Do you like tecs? - Tecs? Detectives. I've read all of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers. Really? I like detective stories too. Could you lend me one? It's so hard to get new books these days. Well, let us swap. What do you have to lend me? Hang on. How about Raymond Chandler? Americans are much more true to life, you know. None of that English country house and locked door stuff. Oh, I'm forgetting my manners. May I get you a drink, Miss Fontana? Elene, please. But, no, thank you. If you change your mind, I mix a first-class whiskey and soda. - Do you, now? - Dad says so. And... what about your mother? - Is she here? - My mother's dead. She was killed in a German bombing last year. Oh, Billy, I am so sorry. It's all right. It's the war, you see. It is not all right. Every terrible thing that happens to us, we simply bow our heads and say, "It is the war." It is not all right, damn it. It really isn't, is it? "He could clearly see the gun reaching through the whorls of light, the muzzle pointed steadily at the bridge of his nose." "The Colt .38 was overbalanced by the heavy silencer embracing the front end.” Bang, bang, bang. And the three culprits bit the dust. Well, I see while the cat's away, the rats have played up too late again, huh? It is my fault. Gaafar warned me you are very rigid about bedtime, but I was enjoying myself too much. - [ will get your drink, Major. - Oh, yes, thanks, Gaafar. And, um, table for two? It's a little bit cold, dinner. - [TUTS] How goes the war, sir? The war goes smashing. And the lights go out. Hold lights out till I get mine. - Good night, Dad. - Night, son. Good night, Elene. We will do it again, Billy. How'd you get Billy to warm up to you so quickly? I broke your iron warrior's code. I let him do something that he's needed to do for a long time. Oh? What's that? Cry. Did you get a chance to talk to the boy that brought Wolff's note? He ran off without a word. 10:30, Tuesday, Oasis. What shall we do? Same thing as we did before, only this time better, I hope. But I do not want to spend another evening with him. Why? He frightens me. I can't blame you for wanting to quit. We'll try and set the trap without you. But Alex is so cautious. He will never show up without seeing the bait there. Why should that bother you? You've earned your ticket to Palestine. That is why you've continued to help me, isn't it? Yes, of course. OK. I'll make all the arrangements. You can drop Elene Fontana and go back to Sarah Askenazy. I suppose that'll be some comfort. I will keep that date with him. He will never show up unless he sees me there. You will never catch him. Thank you for a lovely dinner. Elene. Elene. Wait a damn minute. What for? I told you I will stay. 1 will finish the job for you. I will help you catch your spy. Oh, William, what more do you want from me? I want everything. Everything. [ELENE LAUGHS] VANDAM: I don't knowv. All wanna do is laugh. I don't know why. I don't know. It's never been like this before. I mean afterward. I don't know what I mean. [CHUCKLES] Here you go. Oh, hello there. [BOTH LAUGH] [VANDAM SIGHS] [ELENE SIGHS] Elene. Is that not the way it is supposed to be? VANDAM: I don't knowv. It's a surprise to me if it is. But your wife. I thought you two were so much in love. VANDAM: Everybody did. Only Margaret and I knew the truth. Whatever else she felt for me, it.. it wasn't love. ELENE: I do not understand. VANDAM: Margaret was the only daughter of a British industrialist. We had what should have been a simple affair. So, naturally, she moved into my flat. - [PLAYS TUNEFUL MELODY ON PIANO] - Why "naturally"? You had to know Margaret. Her father ordered her to come home, so naturally she married me. He commanded her to have an annulment, so she got pregnant. Everything Margaret did was rebellion. Even with you? Oh, we pretended we had a happy marriage, for Billy's sake. Then the war came along. And I had had a little experience with intelligence, so I joined the British army. I wanted her to stay home with Billy. So, naturally, she joined the Wrens. She was sharing a bed with a RAF officer when the flat was hit by a German bomb. Why do you keep her photos? - For Billy. - He is a nice boy. You have done very well. No. He's done very well... in spite of me. I drink too much. I don't stay home enough. And somehow... I'm not flexible. We shall see about that. William... I love you. Albert. What a happy surprise. It's good to see your smiling face again. I thought you were in Sicily. I've just flown in. Several hours ago. Ah, sorry. Did you bring me some gasoline? - No. -Ah. Damn it, Rommel, you were supposed to advance to Tobruk, no more. Well, circumstances have changed. Your air and sea support is needed for my attack in Malta. Now, after I have taken Malta, then your supply routes will be secure for an advance into Egypt. Albert, I have not come all this way by playing that old game, advance and consolidate and then try to move again. When they attack, I dodge. When they defend, I go around. When they fall back, I pursue. And they are running. Now is the time to take Egypt. Huh! With 75 tanks? Confirm. I know where the Allies are regrouping, their unit strength, details of their weaknesses. They will do the dying. Where do you get your information? Primarily the reports of a spy, Albert. My God, Rommel. You have no tanks, but you've got your Rebecca. His information was quite correct the last time. I am here to reconfirm the Fiihrer's original order. You will make no further advance. I sent a personal envoy to Berlin... ~ to the Fiihrer. He has only just returned... ~with an answer. "To Feldmarschali Erwin Rommel." "It is only once in a lifetime that the goddess of victory smiles." "Onward to Cairo. Adolf Hitler." Your promotion to Feldmarschall. Congratulations, Rommel. Erwin. Return to the airstrip! Well, let us finish this war. I still don't understand where on earth you got an idea like this. Riding through Cairo. Half the city's trying to get out. The rest of them seem to be preparing a parade for Rommel. And you apparently intend to feed him our battle plans, huh? Now, according to this memo, you no longer intend to capture this Rebecca spy. No, sir, I intend to try to capture him, but first I wanna locate his radio and the key to his code. That way I can be Rebecca and send him false information. - False information. - Yes, sir. You intend to aim Rommel at our weakest point. Now, surely, Major, it makes more sense to aim him at our strongest point and smash him there. Colonel, number one, we must allow Rommel through our lines towards Alam Halfa. Two, he must attack from the south. There's quicksand there that he can't know of without the maps that only we have. And number three, if we draw him into one area, we can concentrate our forces, like he does, instead of scattering 'em all over the map trying to protect everything. Don't you see? Yes, it... does begin to make sense. Tell you what, Major, I'll fine-comb it in shape and then I'll take it up to the brass. Oh, there you are, Vandam. Stand at ease, gentlemen. I've been wanting to talk to you about your memo, Major. - You know about it, General? - I sent a copy to the general. - It's on your memo, sir. - I hadn't noticed. You're supposed to be catching spies, Major, not advising generals on strategy. - I was just saying... - Frankly, I think it's a splendid idea. Now, look, Auchinleck is having a meeting in a few minutes' time. I'd like you to come in there and sell it to him. You can spare him, can't you, Bogge? - Oh, of course, sir. - Right, Vandam. Shall we? [JAUNTY MUSIC] So... Vandam proposes to bait Rommel... ~ from the south... ...by luring him towards Alam el Halfa... ...then to catch him in the desert quicksand... ...and squeeze him on both flanks. Nutcracker. By God. Excuse me, darling. I'm just going to go and wash my... wash my hands. - I'm just going to... - No, no, Sandy. ...wash my hands. No, Sandy, wait. - Sandy, wait. - No. No, no. I must... - Sandy. - I must. I must. I must. No, Sandy, wait. Where are you going? Who the bloody hell are you, you damned wog? God. You, Slavenburg, you traitor. What have I done? What have...? No more. No more. Get it out of my bath. WOLFF: Now I must find someplace to hide him. SONJA: They'll search everywhere for this pig. In a few days Rommel will be here and it won't matter. You are so sure of your Rommel. Yes, I am. This latest report seals it. Not only do I have the disposition of the El Alamein forces, but I also have Vandam's plan for deception. Tonight's message will be the last message that I have to send. Thanks to him. Thanks to you, Major Smith. Tonight... tonight you were to bring this girl to me, this Elene. Alex, you have been promising me long enough! I want something for all of this. All right! You shall have her. Besides, it will be a pleasant enough diversion until you have to radio your message, hmm? Get it out of here. I am sorry. They are lovely. You are lovely. The world is lovely. No, the world is grim. War is hell. But you are lovely. In half an hour I will meet Alex, you will capture him, and everything will be wonderful again. Elene, I'm sorry, but there's been a change in plans. We've got to find the key to Rebecca's code. But when you catch him, you will have it. He would never have it with him. He's probably hidden it with his radio. - What can I do? - Meet him as planned. Make him take you to his home. Don't worry. I've got men surrounding the restaurant. No matter what direction you take, they'll follow you. Once he's in his home, they can grab him and the radio. And then I look forward to you rescuing me. The midnight message to Rommel has got to come from us. But what if he tries to use his radio before then? Then you must smash it. How? There's an element, a small crystal, black crystal. Smash that and the radio's useless. I'm sorry to do this to you. I wanna say to hell with Wolff. I don't want you to see him again. -Butl... - I know. It is the war. [KNOCKING] Who is it? WOLFF: Alex. - [WHISPERS] What is he doing here? - [WHISPERS] Damn. He must have changed his plans again. [KNOCKING] WOLFF: Elene? I am still dressing. [WHISPERS] What should I do? [WHISPERS] Go to him. Open the door. Be careful. I'll be near. Let him in. Go on. Go. [KNOCKING] [DOOR CLOSES] Well, I see someone has already arrived with the same thought in mind... —and done me one better. You do not think I am without other admirers, do you? A British officer who's company I had to refuse in order to spend the evening with you. Hard cheese for the British officer. Come along, then. I've hired a car for the evening. [SIGHS] Actually, I would like to eat dinner at the Oasis. We have made two dates to go there and I have yet to taste the food. You'll enjoy much more what I have planned. Trust me. I suppose I will have to. [ENGINE STARTS] - What's your name and rank? - Corporal Hamadi, sir. - Who? - Corporal Hamadi. Corporal, I'm Major Vandam. Superintendent Kemel may have mentioned my name. - Indeed he did, sir. - Have you got a gun? No, sir, not for surveillance. All right, I'll tell you what I want you to do. I want you to get to a phone right away. Call British headquarters. Ask for Sergeant Lendenowen. - That's Sergeant Lendenowen. -Ah. Or Colonel Bogge. Tell 'em we're outside of Sonja's villa. The man we're looking for is inside. Tell ‘em to bring enough men to take the place right away, you hear? - Do you understand? - Perfectly, Major. Atelephone is just four blocks from here. - Good. I'll wait for you here. -l go. WOLFF: More caviar? No, thank you. I was hoping to enchant you. Instead I bore you? Oh. No. Only 11ish. Time goes so quickly. I thought it was earlier. - What an enigma you are. -\What? One moment so... distant, aloof. The next moment within reach. Now naive and childlike. And then in the next moment so knowing. You seem afraid of me. Hardly. What are you doing here, Superintendent? My detective didn't call your headquarters as you asked. - What? - He called me instead. Oh, damn. I phoned your headquarters and spoke to your Colonel Bogge. He is assembling men and will rush to your side. In the meantime, I came to see if I could be of help. Good. Good. KEMEL: Sonja. Come on, let's go. Gently, Elene. This is a friend. Sonja. Alex has told me so much about you. I've so looked forward to this, my dear. You're early. I could not wait. I told them I was ill. Looks like we'll have to take him. - We? - Yeah. - The two of us? -Yeah. At least we'll have the element of surprise. You got a gun? - Yes, of course. - Let me have it. [GUNSHOT] Alex, what is it? Quiet! How dare you. What are you doing here? - What is the meaning of this? - Major Vandam followed you here. Vandam? Where is he? In there. There's no need to worry. I am cenrtain he is dead. - My radio. - Radio? You promised to give me this radio. Without me, Vandam would have had you this night. Without me, you would have been dead. - Alex. - Wait inside. The radio. Take that body away and wait for me here. You shall have your radio. It's all right. It's all right. Oh. Yes. Oh, yes. Come on. Yes. [ELENE SCREAMS] [SONJA LAUGHS] [SONJA WHIMPERS] I know this woman. I helped Major Vandam raid her apartment for black market goods. Did you, now? You made some sort of arrangement with Vandam to trap me. - You failed. - So have you. I broke the crystal. You think you have won some sort of victory. From this moment on, the length of your life will be measured in six inches of steel. Who did it? Who killed him? Wolff. He stabbed him in the back. I should kill you. Where is he? Where's Wolff? He just drove away, I swear it. Let's see who's home. She did it. By God, she did it. No more messages from Mr. Wolff. - You. -Where's Elene? - How would I know? - Wolff took her. Why are we at his house? He's out in the city looking for you. Vandam is dead. Oh, I see that you had more than a professional relationship. So much the better. The boy will know you. Billy? To end this discussion, because of your actions, I must return to Asyut. But now everyone is looking for Alex Wolff, a lone man, however a man travelling with his family, an attractive wife and a healthy and loving young son, well, that's a different matter. - [GASPS] - Please don't make it difficult. - I hope you understand me. - Or you will cut me again. I will cut the boy. After you. - Ah, Miss Fontana. - Good evening, sir. Captain Alexander, British Intelligence. Major Vandam is on duty this evening and has asked that I come round and fetch young Billy. - At this hour? - WOLFF: It's the evacuation, you see. The children of staff are being taken out of the city tonight. Would you be kind enough, please, to bring young Billy around? But the boy is asleep. Really, I must speak first with the major. It is all right, Gaafar. You know me, and it is urgent we take Billy right now. Very well. If you say, Miss Fontana. Come in, please. Takes a few moments to waken the boy and get him dressed and... Thank you very much. We can look after ourselves. Thank you. That was very helpful, Elene. What could I do? You would have killed Gaafar and taken the boy anyway. Exactly. Your major had a painfully middle-class taste. Painfully middle class. And yet it seems he was quite a reader. Coleridge. I've always liked Coleridge. "If there be beings of higher class than man, I deem no nobler province they possess than by disposal of apt circumstance to rear up kingdoms." Such heavy flow. Rich. One can almost sense the melancholy. I suspect that Coleridge had Teutonic blood, don't you think? [FOOTSTEPS] Elene, Gaafar said that Dad sent you. Will you be coming away with me? - I will be with you all the way. - As will . Captain Alexander. How very nice to meet you, Billy. Will Dad be coming with us? He will follow. Please not to finish Death In The Dust until I join you. BILL: But you know it must have been Phil's wife who did it. Come along. We mustn't miss our connection. Nonsense. It was the bald-headed man with one blue eye. Now, you do everything Miss Fontana say. Be good boy, hmm? I am holding you responsible for all damages to my home. I must tell you, Major, I have many friends in high places. Where is Alex Wolff, Sonja? I know nothing of the man. When did he murder Major Smith? Who is Major Smith? The man my men dug up in your garden, Sonja. You must be mad. I know... I know... I know nothing of... buried men in my garden. I'm a dancer. I'm the most popular dancer in all of Cairo. You told us that, but you haven't told us where Alex Wolff is, Sonja. 1 will not be interrogated. Get out of my house! Corporal. What. .. What... What is this? Call it multiple choice, Sonja. What? Either answer or she cuts. No. You wouldn't dare. Did Major Smith come to see you, Sonja? [SPITS] Cut. No. No. - [SCREAMS] - Did he? No! Did Major Smith come to see you, Sonja? - [SPITS] -Cut. - No! No! - Did he? Did he, Sonja? No! Did Major Smith come to see you, Sonja? - [SCREAMS] - Did he, Sonja? - No! - Did he, Sonja? No! No! No! Yes! Yes, he did! How did Wolff get the information, Sonja? I don't know. - How, Sonja? - I don't know! - Cut. - My hair. No! No. - How Sonja? - No more. No more. How did Wolff get the information? From the briefcase while we were making love. - What happened to Elene? -1 don't know. I don't know. - Where is Elene? Where'd he take her? - He took... I don't know. - He took her with him. - What happened, Sonja? I don't know. I don't knowv. All right. You don't know. Guess. He... He has a house. He has a house. Villa Les Oliviers. Guess again. He has cousins in the desert. He has a back-up radio with them. Radio. Where? Where are his cousins? I don't know. I don't knowv. They're Bedouins. They're nomads. They could be anywhere. I don't know. I don't knowv. Alex would know. - My hair. - All right. - My hair! No. - All right. No. [WAILS] [BELL RINGS] Elene. Elene. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [WOLFF SPEAKS IN ARABIC] First class. There. If there was an evacuation in Cairo, he would tell me exactly where we were going. He would let me know exactly where he was going so that I would know. Will you sit down and stop babbling! Shouldn't like to fight with him when he grows up. You must learn to control him, my dear. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] Gaafar, what's this? What's going on? Captain Alexander said there would not be much time. Time for what? What are you talking about? What Captain Alexander? The officer who brought Miss Fontana here last night. She was here last night? But you sent them, they told me, to take your son to Jerusalem. But he said... you said... What have I done, Major? Gaafar, tell me everything that happened, everything that happened. Was early this morning. This man appeared at the door. Miss Fontana was with him. They had come for Billy, to evacuate him. You had sent them, they said. You were on duty and would follow later. And you did what? I went upstairs to waken the boy and pack him a few things. - Did you not send them for the boy? - I sent for no one. No, I didn't send them for the boy. The man is a spy, a damn spy, and now he's taken my son. Bastard! Slimy Nazi bastard! Are you sure? Have you told me everything? Can you remember anything else? Anything? - No. -You're sure? Quite sure, Major. This blood... Did they hurt him? No. Miss Fontana must have cut her hand, but the boy was not hurt. VANDAM: Asyut. Asyut. That's where Wolff was before. - Asyut. - Oh, my. You must tell the army to send soldiers to arrest this spy. No, no, he'll kill them all before he'll be taken alive. How would he get to Asyut without a checkpoint? Train. Train. Where's that schedule? Where's the schedule? - What time did you say they were here? - Three, four of morning. The next train was. .. - ...20 minutes ago. - Can I do anything, Major? Fill my canteens. My canteens. Don't worry, Gaafar. I'll bring him home. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] I may go for one moment. Billy, run. Stay put. - Let me go! - Quiet. - I want my dad. I want my dad. - Your father's dead. Look at me. If you make the slightest move again to thwart me, 1 will instantly kill the boy and then you. All right. You will get back inside... ...and take care of the boy. [PHONE RINGS] - Captain Newman. - This is Major Vandam. Spoke a few weeks ago about a corporal of yours who was murdered in Asyut. - Do you recall? - Of course I do. Did you have any luck in running down Alex Wolff? Yes, he's on a train right now, due to arrive in Asyut in three hours. It'll be my great pleasure to arrange a reception for him. No, you can't do that, Captain. He's holding hostages. He's also got some equipment hidden that we gotta find. We're gonna have to let him arrive at his final destination. Now, I should arrive at the station about a half an hour before the train. I want you to meet me there with a few items. What do you need? [BELL RINGS] Taxi, taxi. I get you taxi. Get in. In the back. [SPEAKS ARABIC] Come on, move it! [HORN HONKS] Just keep going straight. The road ahead. There's a turn to the oasis. Remember, I have the boy. I thought you were dead. He told us you were dead. Let him think that. Give us a chance to use this. But that knife is always in Wolff's hand. As soon as he comes back with the radio, all I need is one shot. Where is the case, Ishmael? I told you I sent for it the moment I had word of your arrival. Now, please, you will stay in my tent tonight. No, I cannot. I must return to the city immediately. Find a hotel room with electricity. Good. I'l be back tomorrow. This is all very important to you. This is important for the world. - Come, Billy. - Achmed. Achmed! The sun rises, it sets, we live and then we die. May Allah protect you. Here he comes. [WOLFF SPEAKS ARABIC] [ENGINE STARTS] [SPEAKS ARABIC] Can't you drive this thing any faster? - I feel sick. - Quiet. - Better stop for some air. - WOLFF: Keep him quiet. - I feel sick. - WOLFF: Quiet! Elene, please, please, can't we stop? Please. I feel sick. Dad! Dad! [TIRES SCREECH] Get out. Awkward time to meet, Major Vandam. 16 minutes to 12. You wanna make your midnight call, Wolff. - Let's make a deal. - This is the deal, the only deal. Rid yourself of the gun. Step away from the car. Wolff... Leave the boy and the woman here. Take me as hostage. A soldier's no hostage. He's meant to die, Major. Wars are fought to protect children and women. Now, a dilemma... _clustered here as we are. Shall I... drop the boy bleeding for you to watch? Or do I leave you to greet the Afrika Korps as they march triumphantly through Cairo? Thanks to me. To me! Ah, yes. Hold her. Hold her in your arms now if you like. VANDAM: Wolff, it's finished. - You're finished. - I think not. I have the radio. Billy, run! [GUNSHOT] - Dad, Dad, Dad. - Shh. Run into the shadows. Quick. [GUNSHOT] [TAPPING] Rebecca. The Panzers are finished. Field Marshal Kesselring has sent a message asking if you are advancing, holding or retreating. Alexandria is 25 kilometers. One more handful of desert. .. and we would have had North Africa. It was all the fault of Rebecca. This information led us into one trap after another. What shall I radio to Kesselring? Make him happy. Tell him the British have beaten me. I am withdrawing what remains of my forces. VANDAM: It is beautiful. It is beautiful. Even if... I came here with him? Yeah. That is why I brought you here. To show you. My papers came through. I have passage to Palestine. Thank you. Don't go to Palestine. If I stay, a British officer once advised me that I'd have to do another man. I know someone. Oh? Would he take care of me? Yes. Is he a good man? He's a better man. Better than...? Better than before.
