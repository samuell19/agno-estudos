This is my family. This is my dad, Rob. He's a cop. He s also a jerk. This is mum, Marina. She s a nurse, but dad says it doesn't count because she's not a doctor. That s me. Francine, Frankie, Fran, Frangipani and... And that's Teddy. Oh yeah, he's a zombie. It all started one day last year when Teddy came home a little sick. I don t know how or where he got it from, but within three days he was a full on zombie. It s not that hard you know. I go to school, Ma and Pa go to work and Teddy gets locked up in the chamber. It s pretty sweet if you ask me. Pass the salt? Hmm? What did you say? I said salt, Frank. Geez Rob, say please. Even the mute kids in hospital say it. What do you mean? They can't say it. They can say it. They don't necessarily say-say it, but they can do this. Come on Teddy, show Pa with me. Good boy! Want some salt, Teddy? You're so cute. You trying to scare me like that? Bop. That's my boy. How was school today Fran? Yeah, good. There's this dance coming up that will be pretty cool. Pretty lame. Yeah... pretty lame, I guess. That's all really. How was your day Teddy? Rargh. Rargh. So pretty chilled, hey? Well, today, I arrested two guys for B & E. Cool. Don't talk with your mouth full. It's disgusting. You're so funny, Teddy. You're so impressive, baby. No you are. You are. No, you are. You are. You are. Teddy? You ever think Dad doesn t like you? Rargh. Yeah, stupid idea. You're right. Teddy, I really miss hanging out with you at school, but there's this new girl - her name is Calissa. She's so cool. She s got nice hair, those dimpley-things and I think she must play netball. She's awesome bro. Anyway I was thinking of asking her to be my best friend. What do you think? Rargh. Nah. I can t ask Dad about it. He wouldn't know how to make friends. Rargh. I thought so. I ll let you know how it goes. Man you have to practice. You used to be so good at doing that. I love you, bro. Hey, Teddy, have you seen my school shirt? Rargh. I've got it here. What happened? Sorry honey, I put it in with Teddy's shirts again. I forgot blood stains. Yep. Teddy stop being such a messy eater. Can t we get him a bib or something? No. But why? No. Why not? Because I said so. Because I said so. What did you say? Okay, go go go. Francine, get ready. Put your shirt on. Get your bag. Rob, drink that coffee. Get your lunchbox. And Teddy, finish that steak. I love you. I love you more. No, I love you more. I love you more than the time you said you loved me more. That was just then. I know. Bye baby. Bye. There he goes. So Ma, there's this new girl at school that I really like and I wanna ask her to be my best friend. What do I do? Oh. I m not very good at that sort of thing, Fran. You should ask your father. He's very outgoing. But I am asking you. Well then, when I was young, it was a bit easier to make friends. Girls either liked you or didn't like you. But now with the internet... you have to be very careful who you hang out with Fran. If someone doesn't like you, they hate you, they can make your life living hell. People can say anything online and it can really take its toll on girls like you. Sorry, I'm not very helpful. Just be yourself and she will adore you. Also on a side note, you might want to stay undercover today. Magpies love steak juice. Good luck. Bye mum. Hey Frankenstein, nice shirt you got on. Oh thanks. I was joking. Ooh. Bet you wish you were somewhere else right now? Yeah, why don't you go back to Indo-laysia? Butch, that's racist. So? That's offensive to me. Oh. Sorry Brooklyn. That's okay man. And that's not even a country. What did you say? Keep it together man. Keep it together. Haven't got your brother here to protect you anymore, huh? Yeah, where's Teddy when you need him? Not here. Guess what Frankenstein? What? I don't like... You! She screams like a girl. She is one. What's your point? How about you both get lost or I ll tell Ms Green what I just saw. They're bullies. Don t listen to them Frankie. Hey, I like your pink shirt. Really? Yeah, pink is one of my favorite colors. Mine too. Something smells. You stink! Oh, no, it's my shirt. Beef juice. What? Yeah. Ma says I've got to stay undercover, otherwise I might get attacked by magpies. Cool. You wanna try? Ugh. Ow. Ah. Ooh that tickles. Magpies get off me. Stupid Magpies. That was awesome, Frankie. Are you okay? Come on. Okay, so your homework for the weekend is to write a poem on something that you're passionate about. So that might be horses or ponies or... The Mexican Cartels smuggling contraband across the American border. Only to be caught and permanently thrown in jail. Or dolphins or unicorns, or the dark history of the Belanglo State Forest. Or whales maybe? Cows? Cricket? Who likes cricket? How was your day? What the? You're lucky I brought a towel. We've just had these seats cleaned. Ma have you seen my homework? I don't know honey. Ask Teddy. Teddy, have you seen my homework? Teddy, what have you done? That was the best homework I've ever done! Pa, Teddy ate my homework. Oh good one. Like I haven t heard that before. Pa! Seriously, he ate it. Frank, what have I said about lying? I'm not lying. It's a poem, Pa, like the best one I've ever written. Oh Teddy ate your homework. Yes! Teddy! Where's your proof Shakespeare? Chamber, now. You know the rules. This is what happens when you lie. Why'd you do that Teddy? Now dad thinks I'm a liar and it was seriously the best poem I had ever written. You can't repeat that kind of genius. It was like... Uh, I can't remember. You ate it all. I'm sorry, Teddy. You must have been really hungry, huh? Rargh. Oh, Calissa? Well I think we are becoming best friends. I don't know though, the only best friend I've ever had is you and you're family. But Teddy, I've never stared at someone for so long before. I timed it. Forty-three seconds. Do you think we'll be forever friends? Rargh. I think so too. I made her a friendship bracelet just in case, I'm going to give it to her at the dance. Rargh. I love you too, bro. Rargh. Teddy you can't do that. I'm almost eleven. I need my privacy. Bad boy Teddy. Are you excited about the dance tonight Fran? Yeah. Calissa's gonna look so good Who? My girlfriend? You have a girlfriend. Marina, did you know about this? She's a girl who's a friend. Anyway, I was hoping we could pick her up Ma? Who? The girl. Who? My friend! Oh, I thought she might have been imaginary. Oh Rob. Stop it. Of course Francine. I think there's enough room in the car. What do you mean, enough? Well... Teddy's going too. He hasn't been to a dance in so long and he got so excited when you mentioned it. Yeah, he's been bugging me all weekend. Fudge. No, he's going to embarrass me. Embarrass you? You'll be the coolest kids there. You guys look like idiots. Thanks dad. Rob, please don't say anything when Calissa is in the car, okay? She still coming? Does she know what they look like? Behave Mr. Luca. Okay fine. So Calissa, You re ten years old? Yeah. You look beautiful, darling. She's ten? I'm so proud of you both. Look at us, just one normal family. Let's take some photos. Okay. Smile. Smile. Smile Teddy. Teddy, Teddy, smile. Smile Teddy. Teddy? Baby, let's get out of here before anyone notices we know them. Wait, wait. How about one with just you and Calissa then, Fran? Oh sure, Mrs. Luca. And one more with Teddy. Rargh. Stop it Ma, you're embarrassing us. Okay then. Bye. Imagine if Ramsay Street looked like this? I know. Okay, so just don't do anything or say anything. The kids at school can be monsters. Rargh. No, not like you bro. Now look alive. Sorry about my brother Cal. He's so lame. I think he's nice, Frankie. I really like what you're wearing Teddy. You look like a big avocado. Rargh. You're funny. Teddy! Go make your own friends. Where's, where's Teddy? I don't know. Let's find him. Well, if it isn't Frankenstein's brother, Teddy Bear. Long time no see, mate. Yeah, you look sick. You look like Butch's uncle at the funeral. Brooklyn, that's insensitive. Oh, sorry, Butch. Your uncle was such a cool guy. Thanks. But he looks freaky anyway. You know what, Teddy Bear? I never liked your sister. Actually. Yeah, you did. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. No, I didn't Rargh. Want to start it? Keep it together man. Listen here you weirdo. Tell him. I don't like... You! Have you seen Frankie's brother Teddy? Have you seen my brother? You know, Frankenstein gave me one of her sandwiches once. It was peanut butter. I'm allergic to peanut butter, but it didn't really matter. But then I beat her up. Have you seen my brother? He smells like dead people. What? Dead people. What? Dead... oh forget it. Okay. Frankie I know where Teddy is! The girls said they saw Butch and Brooklyn take him outside. Looks like there s no one here to help you anymore, Teddy Bear. Yeah, not so cool anymore, huh? Let's see how deadly you can get. Rargh. Whoa man. I actually like Francine. She's really cool and she's good at art and stuff. And I think she's the prettiest girl in the entire school. Rargh. He'll be alright. What happened to your hand? Oh, it's nothing. Teddy accidentally bit me before. It's fine. Don't worry about it. How was the dance? Teddy bit Calissa and now she s all white. Score! Go Teddy. You use tongue? I mean, don t worry Frank, she was white before the dance too. I'm sorry, baby. Did Teddy make any friends? Don't ask me. Teddy? Rargh. I m still not speaking to you. I can t believe you did that. She was my friend. Mine. Rargh. Don t even try to explain. I hate you bro. Teddy. Teddy. Go back to bed. It's bedtime. Teddy. Where are you going? Ma! Ma! Teddy's trying to eat you. Fran, why did you wake us up? I heard this noise and I followed him into your room. And then I saw him crash down next to your toes and... Fran. Stop yelling. You're scaring Teddy. You haven't run into my room scared, since you were a little boy. Rob, can you get Fran out of here? It's alright. It's okay. But no! But what about mum? Pa! Pa! I swear, I followed him into your room and then... Shut up, Frank! I don't know what you have against Teddy, but it stops now. Go to bed. But what about Ma? I don t care. Go to bed. Good night Teddy. Last night Francine, you woke us up in the middle of the night and scared Teddy. And so he had to sleep with us. Rargh. It was very inconsiderate of you... Yeah, especially because it was the weekend. And so your father and I have decided you will spend the weekend in the chamber. Like a prison cell. Your meals will be brought in. You're in jail now. And if you need to go to the bathroom, knock two times. Not allowed to pee in there. We would appreciate it, if this doesn't happen again. In you go. I will eat you... Ma! Pa! Help me. Help me. What is it? Look, look! On the cupboard at the back. What is it Frank? See. What have you done to my cupboard? This is gonna take ages to clean. There'd better be some sauce left over for my dinner, you idiot. It says, I will eat you all. What is wrong with you Frank? Look what you've done to the cupboard. My cupboard. It wasn't me. It was Teddy. That's enough of that. No more of this talk. Teddy has done nothing wrong, and he's definitely not trying to eat us. [LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS QUALITY[ Smarty pants. I'm sorry Teddy. What the? What happened to Teddy's arm? Rargh. We were playing cricket and it fell off. Uh, stay there. Baby, it says that there have been multiple biting attacks by adolescents in our area. Reckless. I hope we catch those meddling kids and teach them a lesson. You'd never do anything like that would you, Teddy? Rargh. Mum, Dad, I would just like to say that I have been doing some research, and I have some very worrying news to tell you. Teddy's a zombie. Now, I know you don't believe me, but I'm telling you, he was definitely trying to eat you when I woke you both up the other night. Oh, were you Teddy? You were probably using a knife and fork to eat our brains. Yes, that's right, except with his fingers and his fingernails and his sharp chompers biting into every... You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. You have the right to an attorney. Okay, we'll finish that very special poem off tomorrow, class. Tomorrow morning. Yeah. Francine. How are you my dear? Good. How's the family? Bad. What about you dad? Is he alright? Has he locked up any crims lately? Actually, while I've got you here, I might ask you a couple of questions. Do any of these look familiar to you? It's been a difficult time for everyone. A lot of kids coming down with a virus, all those attacks going on. Sounds suspicious to me. What do you think, Officer Luca? Hmm? Now I'm no investigator, but I have reason to believe... that some of those attacks have been linked to children from this school. Maybe you want to take me down to the station and take a statement. Now I'm not gonna name names without an attorney present. But... let's just say there are some pretty rough kids in this school. Ever stopped a bank robbery? Yeah. Ever fired a gun? Yep. Ever been in a high speed chase? Thank you Ms Green. I'm so glad you brought us in. We will definitely speak to Francine at home. That's my pleasure. Really. Anything I can do to keep justice in this town. Justice! (mock gun sounds) Don't worry. I've got a permit for these. Alright. Okay. Hey Fran, we should talk. We haven't DnM'd in ages. Hey Frangipani. It's me, your mum. Mum, I don t feel good. First of all, Teddy is trying to eat you. And Calissa, she's been different. You know, since the dance. And worst of all, I think Dad hates me. Oh darling. That s not true. Your father loves you very much. And Teddy? Well he can act a bit strange sometimes, but it's just a phase he's going through. It's those terrible teens. Did you and Calissa have a fight? No. Calissa got bitten by Teddy and now she's a zombie. Fran, chin up. Don t you worry about her. She will realize what a huge mistake she's made and come crawling back to you. Literally crawling. What's up Frank? Nothing. Okay then. So, how's your girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend. Aw, did you guys break up? No, Calissa's a zombie. I think she was a bit too tall for you anyway. Cheer up. She's my BFFL, dad. What does that mean? Best friends for life. Just forget her, Frank. Trust me, a frenemy is no friend indeed. Aw, what now? He did it! He did it! What s wrong, honey? What happened? Teddy ate my bunny, Booboo. I went upstairs and I found little tiny bones under my pillow. Oh Fran, I'm so sorry. We'll go get you another one on the weekend alright? Another one? It's his fault! This is all Teddy's fault! You can't blame him. He only gets like beef, chicken... Human brain. What did you say, miss? I said human brain. How dare you speak about your brother like that. He's not my brother anymore. He's a murderer. That's enough Frank. He attacked people at the dance. He had blood all over his face from tearing their limbs apart. I said that's enough missy! Then he stole my best friend. And when she trusted him, he took a chunk out of her hand. Say sorry to your brother right now, or else! He ate the only thing I love, and now you're next! Well let's hope he does us all a favor and gets rid of you first. Then finally, I won't have to listen to all of your stupid lies! Rob! Fran! Everyone calm down! Fran, why don t you go find a good place to bury Booboo darling. I'll talk to Teddy. Robert Luca, you should be ashamed of yourself. So that wasn't cool, Teddy. Your father's right. You can't go around eating other people's things. What you need to do is apologize. Rargh? Oh I'm sick of you two ganging up on Frank. She is such a sweet girl and you are always so mean to her. This weekend Rob, you're going to spend some quality time with your daughter and get to know her. And Teddy, you're going to clean the house with me. Rargh. So unfair. I want to clean the house with Teddy. He was a beautiful bunny. It was a she. Oh well, there you go. Hey Fran, I know you've been upset lately because Calissa backstabbed you, She didn't backstab me. But Pa has agreed to take you out to a movie this weekend to get your spirits up. No. Yes. He really loves you Francine and he wants to hang out. Just like we all used to. I'll tell him you can't wait. So... You go. No you. No, you first man. Go ahead Pa. I should anyway, I'm the oldest. What do you want to do tonight? I don't know. What do you want to do? I don't know. Want to go to the movies? Yeah. What should we see? I don't know. What's good? Anything. You choose. Good idea, I'm the oldest. So... you like blowguns? What? Blowguns? What is that? You know the pipe that you blow and then poisonous darts shoot out. Oh... I don't know. They're really coo, l but deadly dangerous. Cool! I like drawing. Drawing's lame. No it's not. Since when? Since always. Mum said it's great. Well Mum says that about everything. Drawing is lame. So I think we spent enough time together. Mum will be happy, aye? Yeah sure. Okay when I say laugh, you need to laugh, alright. Why? To prove we had a successful night. Ready? Now. Where is everyone? Marina? Teddy? Something feels wrong, Pa. Nah. Don't worry about it. They're probably just asleep. It's only eight o'clock. Oh hey baby. I missed you too. I didn't think we were gone for that long. We had a fantastic time, we saw... what was it? My mum's a zombie. You sure? Anyway, we went to dinner afterwards and now we're the best of friends and I think we're gonna keep her. See? Now, where's my newspaper? I see what you've done. But you won't get me or Pa. It's over red-rover. Rargh. Rargh. Rargh. I hate you bro. Let go Teddy. Let go of my hand. Let go! Oh thanks. Rargh. Good morning Frank. You're alive? More than ever. Ma, are you feeling alright? Of course darling. Sit down, have some breakfast. What's this? It's salmon on toast, miss. Your mum's gone through a lot of effort to make that. Because we had fun last night. Look, Teddy's enjoying his. Pa, can I talk to you for a minute? You're kidding, right? What? Didn't we spend enough time together last night? I've got this weird feeling. Well, I think you should talk to your mother about things like that. I think Ma got bit last night. What are you talking about Frank? Raw fish. Since when has Ma ever given us raw fish? Well maybe she's trying something different. I mean, she knows I don't like seafood, but sometimes women get an urge to eat weird food. When she was pregnant with you, all she wanted to eat was rockmelon. I hate rockmelon. But Pa. This time I know it for sure. Soon enough they are going to bite us and we'll be one of them. You know, you're weird, Frank. You're making stuff up. Now hurry up and get inside. But Pa! So then the superhero girl comes in and she saves the day, right Frank? Anyway thanks for dropping me off baby. I love you. See you later tonight. I scared you. So... You're next. What? To be dropped off. Then... I'm going to eat you. Hi guys, wow, red looks great on both of you. Hey, what's white, black and read all over? Close. Newspaper. Or zombie, I guess. I honestly don't think I'll be that nice. I only eat greens. Like broccoli, peas, celery, apples... oh no that's a fruit. Rargh. Rargh. Teddy, what's this? You want it, yeah? Go get it! Psst. Psst, Pa. Psst, Pa. What? Why you being so secretive. Shh. Come here. But I'm hungry. Hurry. Babe I'm home. Francine wants to tell me something secretive in her room. Be there in a second. What is it Frank? Something's not right Pa. Oh, not this again. I've been thinking about it all day. Ma wouldn't have locked up Teddy the night we went out to the movies. They were cleaning the house, remember? So he would have bitten her then. What's your point Frank? I'm just saying, Pa, she'll be a zombie in no time. It'll be us against them. I'm hungry. Save this rubbish for story time at school, okay. We don't have story time. I'm in year five. I'm in year five and my name is Frank and I think my family are zombies and they're gonna eat me. Stop it. And my dad is an idiot because he won't believe me and now his wife and his son are gonna bite his head off. They are. I'm trying to save you. If only, if only my dad would believe me. And then I would save his life and he would be forever grateful. I'm so alone. I'm a lone Frank Frank Frank Frankie-furt. Are we done? Baby, what are we eating tonight? Chicken. Teddy helped me prepare it. Well done Teddy. Maybe you could be the next Iron Chef. Let's tuck in. Well, I'm no chef, but I feel like you've forgotten to do something Teddy. I think you forgot to kill it first. Am I right? Baby? Baby? Is it safe? Can you eat a live chicken? Don't you get salmonella? I told you! They are both zombies now. We gotta let them go. We're next Pa. But maybe it s okay right? I knew it. Teddy's the worst! I eat raw vegetables, I eat raw fruit. Maybe chicken's alright. Pa, they're zombies. Forget them. We have to save ourselves. That makes a lot of sense. Like last night, she was scratching and nibbling and... What? Never mind. We have to look after ourselves Pa, otherwise they'll get us. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? Go into the kitchen. You were supposed to go first. So I managed to get all the food that could fit in my hands. Should last us a few days. What about you? Well I got some handy tools. Some nails, a hammer and some gaffer tape. That's it? What else was I supposed to get? I don't know. You're the cop. Whatever, as if you know everything. Getting food. How is that supposed to protect us? Well, we won't starve, will we? Well judging by your selection, I might have to. I got all this life-saving equipment to protect us from our loved ones barging in and busting down that door. All done. Lock and load. Oh la-dee-da. Well done. Just to be safe. Thanks dad. Hey, Dad? Yeah? Thanks for believing in me today. I never thought Teddy would bite Ma and Ma would become a zombie and they'd both try to bite us next. But I'm glad I get to keep butts with you. I mean, you're a policeman, you kick butt all the time. We'll work something out. Good night. Good night Frangipani. Have they gotten through? What? No. No one gets through gaffer tape. I've got a plan. Frank today I'm gonna show you how to fight. What? I can't fight. Don't be a loser. I'm gonna teach you. Come on, how else are we gonna beat these things? Fine. Whoa. What are they? Blowguns. They are so cool. They are friggin cool. This one is from an ancient Mayan culture. And this one comes from the Ming Dynasty in China. And this one? Was my great-great-great-grandfather's. Let's go. Know how to shoot it? No. Know how to load the shaft? No. Know what a dart looks like? No. Why are you so lame? Actually, yeah, I do know that one. Well, then let's get started. I can't do it. I'm just not good enough. You're just not trying. I am trying. Well, then work harder. And stop being a quitter. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm not Teddy. What is that supposed to mean? I know you hate me Pa. What Frank? Teddy has always been your favorite even when he was a zombie. I'm just the loser, the idiot, the quitter. That's enough. When your brother came home sick that day, I didn't know what it... I didn't know what to do. He'd changed. He said when he grew up he had wanted to be like me, that he wanted to be a cop. And now I've lost that. Look, that's something that I've been trying to find, that bond. But I haven't lost you yet. Then why do you bully me all the time? What do you mean? You call me names and lock me up in the chamber. If I knew that hurt you, I would have stopped. I know I can be harsh with you sometimes. But there's no one else I would rather be with than you, if we're about to face a family zombie attack. So let's try that shot again. It's Calissa. I think she wants to speak to you. What will I say? Maybe you should say... Rargh. No Pa, I'm serious. Oh okay. Okay. If you go out there, then maybe you can sort it out. If she's really your BFFL, then this is your chance to make up. This is your chance to build a bridge and create a relationship that will last forever. You're right. Take this. No, she'll never hurt me. Well then, take the gaff. Bye. You're here. Rargh. Listen Cal, I never got to say thank you for sticking up for me the other day. Rargh. Wait! How can this work? You're a zombie now. How will I know it's me you really want rather than brains and flesh? How can I sleepover at night knowing you're awake, planning my death? What if I don't like raw meat? And I just want a traditional mud cake for our joint birthday party? I don't want two cakes. I want one cake, Cal, shared. Rargh. But you're dead Calissa. There's no way for us. A zombie and human, that's unheard of. Everywhere we go people will judge us for being together, for holding hands in public, for caring for one another. Rargh. Rargh rargh rargh. Rargh rargh rargh. Rargh. Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-rargh. No Calissa, no biting. Rargh. Rargh rargh rargh. Rargh. You're so right. Hey, I've never asked someone this before, but will you be my best friend? Rargh. Oh man. Not you guys again. You know what? I'm sick of this. All my life I've been treated badly. I've been called names by my Pa, beaten up by you guys and my Ma and Bro have tried to eat me. But today it ends. The only person fighting my battles is me. Now please, stop bullying me. It makes me feel sad and anxious. And it sometimes gives me a rash. And I feel you have some issues that you might want to talk to the school nurse about. Oi Frank! You're surrounded. Get out of there! Grab on to the gaff. Best friends for life! Rargh. Hey listen, I'm going to go and get us some help. What? You can't leave me. It's okay. You stay here. I'm the man of the house and I'll protect us. I'll go down to the station and call for more backup. But there's zombies out there Dad. Don't worry about them. I'm awesome. If they come up to me, I'll punch them in the face. Or you can get in with your perfect shot Frank. Okay. But come home soon. It's alright. Look at me, I'm unstoppable. See you soon Dad. Marina. Baby, you look so... So sexy. That was super quick Pa. You really are a superhero! Did you see any zombies? Yeah. yeah. And I had to fight them all off. All good though. You're the best dad. Hey Frank. I've got to be honest. Something happened out there. I miss you so so much. I love you baby. Rargh. Oh Pa, how could you? That's gross. Yeah, well, sometimes a woman can be irresistible. But Pa, she's a deadbeat. Don't say that about your mother. Anyway, I got bitten. What? Where? Where you can't see it. She bit my lip. So I think it'd be like two days, maybe three, before I become full zombie, depending on how deep the bite was. So, I think it's best if I just leave. But Dad you can't go. Come on. Don't make this any harder. Listen, I just want to say I'm proud. You're both sensitive and tough, and the way you handled those bullies out there. That was mad, Frank. And you're a natural with a blowgun and you follow your gut and if you wanted, you would be the best police officer this world has ever seen. I love you Frangipani. I love you too Dad. Time for a new piece of gaff. Ah my arm. Oh baby my neck. No don't. Dad. Argh., Ow, Oh, please. Dad. I have to do a marathon tomorrow. If you can just only take chunks that aren't compatible with breathing. Dad? What now? You're alive? Yes! Geez that sucks. It really hurts. I think they just wanted to infect me some more. You're gonna hate it when we get you. No more Zombie Ma. No more Zombie Pa! And no more Zombie Bro! It's Clacilla, Clarissa... what's her name? Okay, okay.... Teddy eat that fish... steak. I've got a plan. Great work today Frank. Thanks Pa. Geez, you bad father. You're always so bad. I love you honey bunny. Cheeky little ears. I'll put you in a dress. Hmm. Let's tuck in. You're back son. You're back. And cut. Cut. Was that a wrap.
