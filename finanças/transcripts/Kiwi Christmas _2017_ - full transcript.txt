Hi, kids! It's almost Christmas! It's not Santa. Ha ha! It's Crazy Dave from Crazy Dave's Toys. I've got bigger toys. I've got better toys. I've got billions of toys. Don't wait for the real Santa. It's Christmas every day here at Crazy-- Need that last minute Christmas tree? Cheap-Ass Chainsaws will see you right. Just buzz on in to your nearest store for Santa's cut-price specials. When the big fella is on his way. Oh, no! Big night ahead, and you're under the weather. Thank goodness for Bye Bye Cold. Stufur! Get in here! Yes, Boss? What is this? Licensing. We've been through this before. Whatever happened to spreading peace and goodwill by delivering presents to the children of the world? No, we can't do that without a balanced budget. Earn more, spend less. That is why I sold the reindeer. Sold? That old sleigh was so last century. We have to move with the times. Your new sleigh is more cost-effective, and it's all run by this device. Reindeers, they are Christmas. Our gross tonnage of presents per air mile has gone up by 45 % this year. The reindeer can't hack the pace. Yeah, I know how they feel. Another beautiful summer's day here in Godzone. Hope you haven't left the Christmas shopping to the last minute. In the next hour, your chance to win a year's supply of sausages and a barbecue to go with it. Hi, Santa. It's Sam from New Zealand here. I hope you're well up in the North Pole. When my great-great-great grandfather started out, he had a small sack of simple wooden toys made by his elves, and kids loved it. Try telling these kids that. I want a new pony. It has to be a white one. I'm sick of brown. I want boots that are going to make me win. Not these useless things. I want a new phone, a new tablet, some new clothes. Come on, Santa. Call that a video game, Santa? It doesn't even kill people. Sure, I'll take care of your request right away! No, no, no, Boss, don't take it personally, no. Of course I take it personally. I am Santa! Get out, get out, get out of here! Get out of here! Do you know what you can do with this job! You can shove it! Ow, ow, ow! Yes. That's far enough. New Zealand. Yes, yes, you'll never find me! You see, well, my mum and dad are separated, and all I really want for Christmas is for them to get back together. Sam, come on! Are you ready? Yep, I'm ready. Who were you talking to? No one. Look, I've told you before, there's no such person as Santa Claus. - There is so! - Even if there was, he won't know where you're going. He'll find a way. He always does. So what'd you ask for? Nothing. Molly, don't! Give it back! Give it back! I'm calling Mum. And these personalized crackers really show you care. Exactly. Make that extra effort to show your family you really love them. And what better way to show them than with this simple Christmas menu. Dark chocolate and whisky tarts with dehydrated berries and black salt. Mum, Molly's beating me up. - Am not. - Am so. Dad hasn't picked us up. We're here by ourselves, which is technically illegal. Kids, eh? And so then the piece of string said, "No, I'm a frayed knot." Hey, was that your phone? Oh, the kids! Oh. Liz! You were supposed to pick the kids up two hours ago. Could you do me a huge favor, finish off? - Eh? - Thanks. Come on, come on, start! Pete. Pete! Look, I'll meet you at the turnoff to the beach. So you want me to take the kids. Only to the turnoff. It'll make life much easier. You know what? You sticking to your promises would make life easier. Come on, Liz. It's on your way. You just never stick to a plan, do you? Look. My plan is to take the kids camping to spend time together because they're gonna have a proper Kiwi Christmas. That's my plan Liz, please. Just get there as soon as you can. Oh. Sorry, Doug. I owe you one. Merry Christmas. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Hey, I've come for the boat! You've missed three payments! I know you're in there! Who do you think I am, Santa? I'm not a charity! I know you're in there! I don't have time for this! It's Christmas! Oi! Sorry, fellas. Holy... Now that is something. I won't be needing this anymore. Boss? What are you doing in there? I haven't got you down for any test flights. - That is right. - Where are you going? As far from here as possible! Oh, heck. No, no, no, no, no. A million times, no! Stufur! We got a code red. Boo! Yeah! Code Red! Code Red! - We've never had a Code Red before! No. There's been no training for this! I think Santa's gone AWOL. He's here! Hey! - Hi, son. - Dad. How are you, mate? Are you all right? - Good day, Dad! - Hi, my darling. - I missed you both, heaps. - Missed you too. Alrighty. Hi. - I didn't forget. - No, no, no, of course not. You never do. You just get a bit distracted. - Look at Dad's boat! - Choice! And did you buy that with money you don't have as well, just like the TV you bought before the oven got repossessed? Liz, take it easy. I am taking it very easy. I'm going to have a great time in Rotorua at Cathy's wedding. Ah! Excuse me. Cathy, hello! I'm calling the wedding off! No, no, you can't. Yes, I can. - Honestly, men... - No, no, no, no, no. Roberto's had an accident. Mountain biking? Oh, my God! No. He slipped over getting a latte. Will he be okay? Not for the honeymoon, he won't. So I'm postponing the wedding for two weeks. Postponed for two weeks. I'm really sorry, babe. I'll call you later. Ooh, ooh, ooh! That's no good. - You can come camping with us. - Awesome. No, no. The resort's already been paid for. You always loved camping. Remember when Mum and Dad attacked us with those water bombs? And then Mum and Dad had too much wine and got all smoochy. Yeah, yeah, right-oh. Okay, that's enough. You could come camping with us, and still do the wedding. Be like old times. Yeah, but it's not like old times, is it? Come on. I'll make some room. Oh. Fireworks for New Year's Eve. Don't tell your mum. Sam, pass me that suitcase, mate. Get around, get around! Liz! Get over here, Liz! Oh. Could've been worse. Brilliant, Pete. Absolutely brilliant. Whoa. All I want is to rent a car. Not until after Christmas. What? After Christmas? - Hey, are you kidding me? - That's right, lady. Hello? Well, at least you got your clothes. Yeah, but I haven't got my car. My nice little car! Okay, um, I am so sorry. I was just really looking forward to a really nice, relaxing holiday, okay? Yeah, we know. Look, the last thing I wanted was for your plans to be ruined. But, well, since we're all here, why don't you at least spend Christmas with the kids? - Yeah! - It's only for a couple days, and I'll drive you to Rotorua on Boxing Day, if that's what you want. - Come on, Mum. - We've got the pup tent. We've got plenty of food. We can make it work. For the kids. I'll be on my best behavior, I promise. - This doesn't look good. - Mm. Boss, if we don't get all the stuff delivered, there'll be millions of disappointed children all around the world. Yeah. That's millions of ungrateful kids. You can't do that. You're Santa. Ah. Sure beats the city, doesn't it? No Wi-Fi, though. I'll Wi-Fi you. What? Ah, welcome to Paradise. Mm. What have we got here? Oh, yeah. Oh. Good afternoon, sir. Coastal Security. Guarding our coast to keep you safe. Just doing a routine check. You got anything to declare? I don't think so. Just an old bag of chips under the seat. Pete, just stop it. This is actually no laughing matter. My job is to keep out undesirables that can come in by land, sea or air. In fact, I think you could be harboring some Ciona Intestinalis? Now, don't move while I inspect your rear end. Of your boat, of your boat. I meant to say boat. - Hadn't finished. - Okay. So is this the only fruit you have with you? That's right. Then what do you call this? That's our Christmas cake. Yeah. A Christmas cake containing fruit. Fruit? I'll take care of that! You guys are gonna have to leave this with us. It needs to be disposed of in the appropriate manner. Hey, why don't we just let them off on a warning this time, eh? Tama, a word. - Yeah, sure. - Just hold it there, folks. Yeah? Are you gonna be the one to let in a tiny piece of fruit that releases the larvae of a fruit fly, and brings down New Zealand's entire agricultural system? It's a Christmas cake. It's a Christmas cake. A little Christmas cake, eh? Yeah. Ah! Too much. What are you lot still doing here? Scat! Grapes. Another biological hazard. Merry Christmas, guys. What a waste. For your information, we're just doing our jobs. Keeping our coasts safe, okay? - All right! - Okay. Come on, Pete, let's go. All right, let this lot through! Don't forget to recycle, eh, mate? Hey, look, the hippies are back. And the family with the kitchen sink. Here we go, good ol' family campsite. Ah. I'll just get 'em to move. Hey, boys. Look, I'm afraid, um, you're in my spot. Really? Oh, I'm sorry, mate, 'cause I booked and paid for this site. They must have made a mistake. Show me your booking slip, and I'll move. I don't have a booking slip. - So you've just turned up? - Oh, no. I mean, we've been coming here for years. This has always been our spot. And now you just want me to move. Yes, please. Well... I got a little Christmas message for you. Get lost. Merry Christmas. Ah... You know what? I just remembered, this spot is rubbish. It's too windy. I know the perfect spot. It's just along here. I like that spot. Two, three, nice and easy. That's the one. Here we go. Do you even know what you're doing, Pete? Ah, of course, I remember. Do it in my sleep. Should we time you? Dad loves a challenge. Right, first up the poles. Liz! - Norman and Elsie. - Oh! Lovely to see you again. Oh, Molly! She's shot up in the last 12 months. I've been taking illegal steroids. Sorry? Nothing. And don't tell me. This young man here is Sam, right? Yeah, that's me. Know what? Can I have the poles, please? Oh! Oh, Norm and Elsie, how are you? - Hello, Pete! - Hey! Lovely to see your happy family again. Actually, Mum and Dad are having a trial separation. - Oh. - Kids, eh? Yeah, well, um... bet you're looking forward to Santa Claus coming, eh? Yeah, but I don't think he'll find me this year 'cause I've forgotten to tell him we're going on holiday. Oh, no, don't you worry, I promise you. Santa will find you. - Yeah, well, we've got to go. - See you later. - Bye. - See you, Norm. That was a bit rough, mm-hm? - Sad. - Yeah. Yellow poles, please. - Where's he going? - He's lost his marbles. Well, he's not gonna find them down there. Ooh. I'm tasting... blackcurrants, Jupiter berries, marshmallow biscuits, and, uh... cinnamon muffins. Ah, this is the life, eh? Hey, Dave? Do you know that there's 17,000 kilometers of coastline in New Zealand? Yes, mate, and it's our job to guard every centimeter of it. Yeah, right. Another disappointing day. You're gonna need to make yourself a really good catch if you want to get out of this backwater. That'd take a miracle. Oh, oh, oh! Oh! - Ohh! - Whoa! Oh, oh, oh, oh. Sausage, Dave? Most gentlemanly of you, Tama. Here it comes. I don't know who you are, but I'm gonna bust your backside. Mmm. Ah! Yes, Boss. We have an intruder trying to enter our airspace and slip in under the cover of darkness. Ah! They're coming your way now. Keep your eyes peeled. Eyes peeled, Boss. Don't you worry. Oh, sorry, bro. But the instructions say green first, then black. Yeah, well, instructions are for the cognitively impaired. Just forgot your father always has to do it his way. The right way. Can't we just start again, and try to do it together? "Oh, I know what I'm doing." How many times have I heard you say that? Not my fault you're such a control freak. I'm just telling you what it says. I don't need to be told what to do. - I know how to do it. - Obviously. Idiot. - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. - You're dumb. Sam, what the heck do you think you're doing? You should know better than to bring fireworks. Yeah, it was just for fun. Ohh! Pull up, pull up, pull up! Pull up, pull up, pull up! Oh, no! What's going on? What's happening? What's happening? What? No, you. Boss? That thing just flew over the bay. Did you see anything? That is a negative, Boss. Check it out! Now! - Sam! - Sam! - Are you all right, son? - Oh, my God! Hey, help me get him into the recovery position! Is he okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! - This guy needs help. - Okay, sir, calm down. Look, we've had some reports of unidentified flying objects. In the sky. Flying around. - You seen anything? - Nothing round here. Probably just a fruit fly out to get you. Pete. It'd be a battle of wits. - Pete! - I've got my eye on you. Oh, for goodness sake! What about this poor man? Oh, well, what do we have here? Mm. Drinking and swimming. He should know better at his age. Easy on the sauce there, Granddad. Yes. Come on. Up you go. There you go. - Did you find anything out? - No, he's not a local. None of the other campers know him either. I reckon he's from some old folks' home. - Probably got confused. - Shh. Well, he can't stay here. Okay, okay. There is no need to panic, all right? He's just stopped for a rest. He'll be back in time. We need to have everything ready for him. So go! Git! That sleeping bag okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Good, fabulous. Thanks! Great. - Night, family! - Night. - Night, darling. - Night, son. Gotcha. Ah! Isn't this glorious? Ah. Yeah! Yeah. Mum said you needed a hat. Dad said it's time for breakfast. Breakfast? Yes. Thank you. Oh, yes. Look, I'm just saying-- As long as the kids are safe, it'll be fine. Here he comes. You've had quite the adventure. - My son found you in the drink. - Drink? - The water. - He's still hungover. You should take it easy on the sauce, mate. - Sauce? - Drink. Oh. Anyway, I'm Pete. This is Liz, my... Hi. Hi. - Uh, Molly and Sam. - Hi. I remember now. And my name is San... Stan. - Stan? - Stan. - Well, hi, Stan. - Hi, Pete. Now that accent tells me you're not from around here. Where you from? I'm-- Up north. Oh. You might know my whanau. Mmm. Yeah. Ohh... Anyway, wrap your laughing gear around this. Laughing gear? Has anyone said you look like Santa? Hey, Sam, don't be rude. - But he does. - It's all right. I have heard this many times before. So where exactly are you staying? With my family. Oh, nice. Are they here? No, not yet. Oh. How did you get here? By bus. But we found you on the beach. Yeah, yeah, on the beach, yeah. By water bus. Okay, well, your family, are they supposed to be here already? - Is that right? - Yes. I'm sure they'll turn up. Whoo! He still believes in Santa Claus. And you don't? It's scientifically impossible. Santa has 24 hours to deliver presents to over a billion children. That gives him one-thousandth of a second per household to drop down the chimney, leave the presents, and eat the snacks left for him and his sleigh. Sounds hectic. And don't get me started on how eight reindeer could ever provide enough thrust to move that sort of present payload. 45 % bigger this year too. Really? Oh, ah, I imagine. - Oh. - Yeah. Off your backsides. Tama! Surveillance headquarters just intercepted this call. God, I love Surveillance headquarters. Boss, if we don't get all that stuff delivered, there'll be millions of disappointed-- "That stuff delivered". Do you know what that means? Um, he's a pizza man. - Hawaiian? Oh! - Cheesy crust. It means they're smuggling something illegal into this country. Do you know how I ended up with you two clowns? How? Because I let the Calici virus slip through my fingers. It was smuggled in down the underpants of a farmer on my watch. And do you wanna know why that's never gonna happen again? Yeah, because your gonna use rubber gloves next time? It's so hard to soar with eagles when you're working with kiwis. No, you idiots! Because you two are gonna track him down and find him. - Understand? - Yes, Boss. This man here appears to be the courier, okay? Now, he's wearing some sort of disguise. Have you seen him before, Tama? Ah, no, no, never. Track him down, find out what he's up to, and stay undercover. Don't let him recognize you, okay? We need to catch this sicko red-handed. And if you guys fail, I've been asked to recommend two Border Security members to do a two-year stint on a small island. Oh, nice! In Antarctica! According to Einstein, time makes very strange things. If you can move faster than the speed of light, you build a sleigh with an antimatter warp engine, and according to my calculations, Santa would be back home at North Pole before he even left. But what's the point in him? Young lady, he must have some uses. I hear he's a very intelligent and very clever man, this Santa. Clever enough to bring our parents back together? Santa cannot change the way people feel and think, though it might be a better world if he could. Gidday, gidday. Thought I'd introduce yourself as it looks like we're neighbors. - Hi. Liz. - Harry. Good to meet you, Liz. Those are my boys, Mick, Rick and Dick. Ah, nice to get away for a wee break, isn't it? Oh, yeah, especially when you're a solo dad and, you know, you're trying to make the best of it. - Oh? - Yeah, widower. My wife Melissa, she... She got a brain tumor. Yeah, we met in Form Two. She was the love of my life. - I'm so sorry. - Hey, these things happen. But it's been hard on the boys, obviously. Anyways, if you ever want to come for a ride in my boat. Ah, no, thanks, mate. Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you two were-- No, no, no. Pete's my ex. Ah, trial ex. Well, I think it's great that you two put the love for your kids ahead of any personal differences, and come away on holiday together. Yeah. Um, Harry just invited me for a ride in his boat. 2.5 horsepower? Yeah, I got, ah, 15. Ah, 2.5 is enough to get me to the big one. Huh. I'd hate to see the size of your carbon footprint. Ah. Bigger than yours, mate. Hey, let's get out on the water, eh? - Make a day of it, yeah? - Yeah! Okay. Hey, guys, don't forget your togs and towels! So you and Pete are separated? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, news travels fast in our family. We're just too different. Pete lives in the moment. I like to plan ahead. But ever since he moved out, we've had no money problems. We don't argue anymore. The kids are still doing well at school. I'm a lot happier now, that's for sure. - Yes. - Go, Dad! Sometimes you just have to do what you think is... best for you. The secret to surveillance is to get as close as possible to the enemy camp, okay? Stealth, yep, stealth. Hey! Sneaky. - Oi! - Hey, mate. Nothing to see here, people. Just carry on, yep. Whoo-hoo-hoo! All right, hold on! We're gonna go round one more time! Keep going! Whoo-hah! Hang on, boy, that's the one! Good boy, Sammy! Yeah! Could be anywhere. Good boy, that's the one! Oi! Oh. Gotcha. Okay. We need to observe him up close. Perfect. Okay. Oh! Oh, okay. Oh, oh, oh. Andy, there's some creep perving at me. Uh... Wow! That was fun! Yeah, but it's not for me. Okay, so... plan B. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, okay, here we go, here we go. Gotta limber up. Okay, yeah, yeah, good, good. Okay, okay, pass it. Go back, go back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good. Aah! Oww! That man broke that little kid's toy. I'm good, I'm good. Well, these things happen. There we go, there we go! - Well? - Huh? I guess Santa will have to give him another one for Christmas. Abort! - Hey, hey! - Go, go, go, go! Where do you think you're going? Come back! Okay, let's have a look. Those eggs, eh, son? Oh, no, it's broken. Oh, amazing! Wow! It looks better than the old one. Yeah. - Thank you, Mister. - Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. How did you do that? Well, I think it's time to cool off. Lizzy! About to go for a whizz around the bay to warm her up. Care for a lift? Oh, no, thanks! Oh, come on, you only live once! Where's Mum? All right, then. What's she doing? Dad! He's making a run for it! Come on! Stop it! Help! - Help! - That looks like Stan. - Cool! - Will he be okay? Hey! Sorry, mate, government business! Okay, come on. Living the dream! David! Sorry about that. - Far out! - Stan! Stan! Hey! Hey, hey, are you okay? Catch you later, Lizzy! - That was fantastic. - What happened? - Hey, what happened? - Your friend. Mr. Check-Out-My-Massive-Boat. That's what happened. Where you going? I'm gonna go and provide for my family. But don't let me stop you from having a good time, okay? Yeah! Nice one, Dad. Hey, Dad, what's your saying? "The worst day fishing is better than the best day working." You better believe it, mate. I got something! - Well done, Sam. - Good man! It's snagged. On something red. Ah, I'm, um, um, um, I'm gonna be seasick. Just over the side, Stan. I have to get back to shore. Please. Whoa. It's come loose. Okay, all right, all right. Hey, lines in. We'll head back. Hi, Mum! The hunters have returned, and the family shall eat tonight! Gidday, gidday! Caught far too many of these for us to eat. - Would you like one? - Wow! That's so nice of you. Ah, no, no, no. We're good thanks, mate. We got our own. Suit yourself. Just trying to be neighborly. Showed him. - Ah! - Sorry. Hey! Why don't you teach your kid how to hit the ball straight? He can hit a ball straighter than any of you lot. Well, you're talking to the campsite cricket winners five years in a row. - But not six. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Game on. Dad! - What? - Look at them. We can beat them, right, Dad? Of course! No doubt. Liz! I'm out. Stan, you look like you could throw a good googly. Googly? ¶¶ - Let's go, Ricky! - Let's go, Stan! - Big hit, mate! - Come on, Stan! Howzat! Yeah! Yes! Let's go, Dad! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - Whew! - Ricky! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Pow! Do your best, eh, darling? Keep your eye on the ball, okay? Dad, I know what I'm doing. Let's go, darling. Big hit, yes! That's one! Go, go, go! Yes! - Howzat! - Oh! Let's go, son. Big hit! Go, Sammy! Oh! Brilliant, Dad. You caught the ball. Out! He's out! - Yeah! - Whoo! All right, Mickey! Just get going! - Yes! Go, Molly! - Run, Molly! Here, darling! - Yeah! - Nice one, Dad! Great game. Good innings, good innings. Come on, Dick! - Way to go! - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! - What was that, Dick? One, two, three, go! Careful, mate. You might do yourself a mischief. Watch and learn. Give him a good one, Sam. Boom! - Sam! - You all right, son? Sam, are you okay? Harry? Harry, that was a little bit mean. Oh, it's a competitive game, Liz. Maybe you shouldn't go crying to Mummy every time something goes wrong. You've gotta harden up! Is that what you tell your boys when they miss their mother? We don't miss her that much. She'll be back on Tuesday. Hey, you! I thought she was... In Sydney... on a girls' holiday. Yeah, right. That's enough, boys, eh? Back to the game, huh? Flight or fight? Fight! Yeah! Yeah! Bring it on! Yes! One to win! Going out of the park. Whoo-hoo! - Yours, Stan! - Yeah, baby! - Catch it, Stan! - Come on, Stan! Yeah! To the victors... the spoils. - Okay. Tongs. - Tongs. - Fork. - Fork. You two realize you're watching a master at work, right? Unlike some others. Ohh! Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Water, water! - Is that on me? Give it! Oh. Maybe I should cook. - Yeah. - Bunch of amateurs. Oh! Dad! They look very nice. They're yum. Thanks. So has your family arrived yet? My family? Oh. I just heard today they are not going to make it for Christmas. Ah. Well, that's a shame. Nothing serious, I hope. No, no, no. Just a last moment changes of plans. Well, you can stay with us. I-I couldn't possibly. Well, you can't spend Christmas by yourself. Dad! Well, it's your Mum's holiday now too. Stan, we'd be delighted. Wouldn't we, Pete? Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Sure. - Yeah It is so kind of you, so kind of you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much Let's eat. - Yeah. - Dig in. Yeah, dig in. Nice work. What say he's never coming back? Yes, what say? We should go get him. Yeah. How? - The reindeer! - Yes! No! We let them all go, remember? Hey, he'll be on his way back right now. I'm sure of it. Come on. We might have to keep you on, Stan. Yeah. No more Santa. Goodbye. No. No, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! ¶ I've been looking everywhere near and far ¶ ¶ Turns out right here in front of me is where you are ¶ ¶ You got me in my head ¶ ¶ You got me in my heart ¶ ¶ You got me in the air ¶ ¶ You got me from the start ¶ ¶ Give me your love ¶ ¶ You've got my love ¶ ¶ Whoo hoo hoo ¶ Watch out for your marshmallow. ¶ Hoo ¶ Here, give it to me. You can have that one. That was beautiful. Hey, do you remember Barry's Beach? When did we go there? Well, you didn't. This was long before you were around, mate. Tell us about it. Well, that's where I met your mum. I was out camping with a few mates, and... there was this beautiful woman around the campfire, and I had to woo her, which I did with my amazing guitar skills. Well, that's what I told him anyway. We spent a lot of summers there. Just a little pup tent and a boat just like this one. It's moving. It is moving, isn't it, darling? No, Dad, the boat's moving! Hey! Mate! Please, please! - Get out of the way! - Look, I can pay! You're too late. I've got the money right here, right now, I can pay. You got two minutes. What's going on? I bought the boat when I had the contact, but it fell through, okay? - It's not my fault. - It's never your fault, Pete. I got that boat for our kids, for our family to have fun. Oh, well, at least you've got the money now, right? Yeah, about that... Merry Christmas. Hey, Liz, wait! Liz, please! I just want to say-- Oh, no. Ah! Morning, Stan. Good morning. Christmas Eve is upon us. Yes. Yes, so it is. So it is. Morning. Ta. Hey, Stan, you want some kai? What? - He means breakfast. - Oh, breakfast. Yes, thank you. Of course. Ah, yes. - Hello, darling. - Hello. Mum! Dad! Look at this! Hey, where'd you get that? On the beach. Open it. No, no. It might belong to somebody. Finders keepers. Cool! Sam, were there any more where you found this? Not that I could see. Cool! Christmas crackers! Yeah. Whoa! - Ooh, a present. - Careful! It could be booby-trapped. That's what these big-time smugglers do. It's just a present. Yep! Explosives! Secure the perimeter! She's so brave. Look out! Get out of the way! What was that? I'll go and have a look. Ooh, okay. Why didn't the skeleton go on the rollercoaster? Why? Because he didn't have the guts. Zip it! Using exploding Christmas crackers to disguise your evil smuggling. How low can you go? I don't know. How low? I don't joke. Oh. I will find him, and I will crush him. Right, Boss. Come on. That's him, there he is. Ask him, Elsie. Liz said you might be able to help us. Norm always plays Santa at the children's Christmas picnic. We wondered if you'd take his place. You look the part. I'm very sorry, but no. We've been doing it for 35 years. We weren't able to have children, so... we've always loved giving the children here a little something. It... It would mean so much to Norman. Yeah. I've a pillow in there for the tummy, but you may not need it. What? Come on, Stan. Just say yes. - Well-- - Oh, thank you so much! - No, I did not say yes! - Thank you. Nice, Mum. Just taking one for the team, eh? Here he is. There he is, all the way from the North Pole, Mr. Santa Claus himself. You shut up. You look just like the real thing. - Duh, there is no real thing. - Hey, Molly. Just because you don't believe in him doesn't mean he doesn't exist. - Eh, Stan? - Of course. I think this Santa needs a good old kiwi entrance. Come on. Come on, Stan. You don't want to go the Santa picnic, right? There he is, boys. No, that's Santa. Hey! What, you guys not coming? Ah, yeah, yeah. We'll take care of the boat. Okay, awesome. Thanks. Okay. This better be good. Trust me. Santa! Now, boys and girls, have you guys been good this year? - Yes! - Excellent. We're really pleased to be here today, aren't we, Santa? Yeah, ho ho ho, yes. Anyway, Santa's really excited to hand out some presents, and first up, we've got... Tyler. Yes, Tyler. - Come on up. - Come here, Tyler. Yeah, Merry Christmas. - Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, what's he got there? - Whoo-hoo! - Thanks. Fantastic. Now, Santa... you're delighted to hand this over to Lily, aren't you? Yeah. Lily, Lily. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you, Santa. All right. Isn't this fun, Santa? Very fun, yes. Ho ho ho. Good girl. Oh, that's lovely. And this one, Santa, is for Scarlett. Okay, Scarlett. Here is for you. Thank you, Santa. - I love you, Santa. - Oh! Thank you, Santa! It was around here somewhere. You mean... that? Out of the way! Out of the way! This is official Coastwatch business. - You! - Hey, hey. You get presents only if you have been a good girl. Smart aleck. Smart aleck. This man is not Santa Claus! Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy. But the kids. He has violated border security, customs and immigration rules by bringing goodness knows what into this country. But now the jig is up! Hey, leave him alone! Leave him be! He is smuggling illegal substances into these so-called presents under the guise of Santa. You make me sick. - Bubbles. - They're bubbles. - Bubbles? - They're bubbles. A likely story. Tama. - Bubbles. - Bubbles. It's bubbles. Oh, mate, you guys are crazy. - Those are presents for kids! - Hey, moron, stop it! Oi, you watch your mouth! Don't you talk to her like that. I've got this Pete. You butt out of it. You don't talk to him or him that way, please. - Take him away! - What? What? No, you're not taking anyone away, okay? You guys get out of here now! Yeah, get out of here! Under the Boarder Security Act, I have the power to detain anyone that I have grounds to believe is breaching this country's security. Hey! Christmas is over, old man. Ho ho ho ho! - Go, Santa! - Get him! You are powerful. You are a winner. Believe in yourself. You are the man. Got ya! Move out, Boss! - Do you think it works? - Let's try. Yow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Santa! Where are you? We need you! Wait. What? Santa? Stan is Santa! - I told you! - Ring them again. Don't hang up! Born to be wild. Hey! Pick it up, pick it up. - I've got this one! - Oi, come here! Get back here! Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Oi! Oi, come back here! Santa's with us. What? You kidnapped him? No. He's just staying with us. Well, tell him to stop staying with you and get back to North Pole! Huh? It's Christmas Eve! Yeah. How would he do that? He needs to get into his-- Hello? Hello? We've got to help him! - Whoa, whoa! - Oi! We can use this to pull the sleigh up. Isn't this supposed to be tied off? - Whoa! - Sam! Sam! Sam? Sam, grab my hand. Sam! Sam! Help! Stan, help! Help, help! - Sammy! - Help me, please! Mum, Dad, help! Please help me! Help! Molly! Molly! Okay. Sam! Sam! Grab my hand! - Come on, he's getting away! - Slow down, Dave. Help him, Dad! - Got ya! - Go, Tama! You're coming with me, old man! What kind of sicko are you? On the boat, son. In there, buddy. Sam, are you okay? Darling, you look after your brother, okay? I'll get us back to shore. What were you kids doing out in the water anyway? Stan! Stan is Santa, and we saw his sleigh, and Sam got his foot caught in a rope! Molly, this isn't time for games, baby! - What? - Idiot! Come on. Ohh! So you can breathe okay, honey? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll get you a towel. Good boy. Are you okay, son? Sam, Sam, they've taken him. Well, we've gotta help him! Wait. I've still got this. No, no! Let me go! Let me go! The only place you can go is directly to jail! I've done nothing wrong! You are an illegal alien smuggling in illegal goods and risking the nation's biosecurity! I am Santa Claus! Santa Claus, Santa Claus. I hate Santa Claus! When I was younger, all the other kids at the orphanage, they all got presents, except me! You wanted a doll. I left you one, and one to Harriet, little Harriet next to you. That cow! She said she got two dolls. Ah, no, no! None of your mind games with me, old man. You're no more Santa Claus than my butt. Hey, Santa, why aren't you at the North Pole, putting presents on the sleigh? It's a little complicated. That's because he's not Santa Claus! Get him in! I'm sorry. Hello, hello, hello. I'm out of the workshop right now. Leave a message after the beep. Ohh! He's running out of time! Big Mama to National Base. Big Mama, go ahead. We've got a Code Purple. Roger. Code Purple. Code purple! Code Purple! Run! Run! Hey, little man. - Let me go! - Settle down. Put me down! - Right now! - Come on. Put me down! Okay. Santa's little helper, eh? He really is Santa! A-A-And you should let him go. Put him in. In there, little man. What are you doing here? Of course they'll be all right. They're good kids. Well, of course. They're our kids. - Where's Sam? - Where? Is he all right? Yeah, yeah, but they've got him and... - Stan. - Who? Those Coastwatch guys locked them in their caravan. - No, they can't do that, Pete. - We need to rescue them! - Let's go. - No, no, no, wait. - What? - No, we need a plan. No, we need to go now. If we rush into something like this, we're gonna be-- I'm not rushing in without thinking! Can you both stop?! You guys never listen to each other. Can't we work together on this one? It's okay, it's okay. I know who you are. Sure. My family are coming to help. They'll get us out. And you can get back to deliver all the presents. I'm not sure it's just going to work. Flight or fight. Fight! You can do it Do you know why I am here in New Zealand? Sam... I don't want to be Santa anymore. What do you mean, you don't want to be Santa anymore? You don't have a choice. Well, I know it's hard for you to understand. What I understand is there's millions of kids waiting for the most exciting, brilliant day of the year... for you. Not for me. The presents. They're waiting for the presents. Things. Things that get more expensive every year, and even then, they are not good enough. By January, they'll be broken and forgotten about. Not my presents. I can remember all of them. You gave me a kite when I was five. I was so excited. And then there was Clarence when I was four. That stuffed bear. Yeah. I've still got him. There's millions of kids just like me, who can't wait for Christmas. And it's not just the things. It's the magic. And you're part of the magic. By my calculations, you'll need more than just magic to get back home. Molly! Would this help? The world needs you, Santa. All right, all right. Get up, get up. Pete, what do you think you're doing? You should know better than that, pointing fireworks at people. Well, it's a diversion. It's matter of life or death. Yes, it will be if you set those off. Nice job, Boss. Just keeping our shores safe. Hurry up. Come on. - Hey! - Hey! Stop him! Dad, now is good! Ow! Pete, get over here! - Whoa! - Aah! We're under attack! Run! Oh, well. Could've been worse. I'll help Dad. Keep coming, Mum. - Mum? - Yes! Whoa! - Hang on. - Hang on what? Hang on what? Nice job, Mum. - Hold on, Stan! - Please help! Don't leave me. Don't leave me! Not on my watch. Please! Help! Take me off of here! Hang in there, Stan! Come on, they're getting away! I'm going as fast as I can! Mum, Stan's on the roof. You're gonna kill him. Stop! Oh, hey, Stan. Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't see! ¶ Silent Night ¶ ¶ Holy Night ¶ ¶ All is calm ¶ ¶ All is bright ¶ They're gonna have to move. No, we need to get to the beach. - To the beach? - Trust us. Please. Can I have your attention, please? Santa needs to get back to the North Pole right now, or he won't be able to deliver everyone's presents. - Probably a charity thing. - Sam. Hey, I don't think this is a good idea. Dad, you said you would trust us. - But the Coastguards-- - Dad! All right, so who wants to help Santa get back to the North Pole? Left it a bit too late, haven't you, mate? Hey, hey, hey, you. It only takes four minutes to get back there. And if I exceed the speed of light, I'll be back earlier than I left. Santa can do anything! Yeah! Yes, my little friend. All right, we need to get to the beach now, and we need lights, any lights you can bring. Whoa, hey, this man is a fugitive. No! They're wrong! He's a kind old man. Hey, do you want to ruin Christmas for all these kids? Yeah, what she said. All right, let's go! Lights, torches, lanterns. Lights! Lights! Big Mama to National Base, I need a recovery team. Roger, Big Mama. Recovery team on its way. I'm out of the workshop right now. Leave a message after the beep. I'm afraid that's it. He's not coming back. There'll be no more presents delivered this year. What now? Crazy. My sleigh. Now everybody back off. Back off, back off. On this side. Hurry up, hurry up. Move, move, move, move, move. Because... I want to thank you all, my Kiwi friends. And especially, I want to thank Sam... and Molly... and Liz and Pete. My new friends. And I want to thank all you little friends. You have helped me so much. Especially you, Nathan. Don't be surprised I know your name because I'm Santa. Someone might think, sometimes, that this period of Christmas is gone-- - Step away from the sleigh! - Ah, Stan? It's you who needs to be gone now, mate. - Santa. - Santa. All right, show me your lights. You know what to do. Now go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Yes, my friend.
