This is my half-brother's story. I tell it because it's all I can do with the way things turned out. Eugene left me with something more important than any of the facts. Now, first thing people get wrong about his story is the beginning. It didn't start with the Wells lady. It started with the first train full of homesteaders. Amongst the heartbroken fearful who arrived in Bismark on that day were John, Olivia and Eugene Baker. The Bakers had moved their lives West into the Great Plains, on a promise. A promise that now looked as rotten as the dirt they stood on. They prayed for rain and began to build a new life up from scratch. But John wasn't convinced. He believed there was something cursed about this land. Over the next years, John's drinking worsened... ...and he became paranoid. His mind filled with visions of some other life... where he could live in God's grace again. And just like that, when Eugene was five years old, - he lost his father. - You're just leaving? An absence was created that would haunt him for the rest of his life. Eugene only ever got one postcard from his father. In it, John claimed he had found the eye of God in the most beautiful place on Earth, the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Olivia quickly tried to fill that absence in Eugene's life, and a year later she married George Evans, a county deputy, farmer and my father. But John Baker and the world he wrote about were never far from my brother's mind. He wondered what his father had really found out there. Then, when Eugene was 17, something else took his attention. All of ours, for that matter. Just like the curse John had spoken of, the land turned on us. My fellow Americans, I have been on a journey to nine states. Fourteen storms hit Bismark in the first year. I saw a group of families who had lost their wheat crops, lost their corn crops, basically withered without food. The more we tried to start over, the worse they got. And the banks came for Bismark. Crazy preachers would scream about God and salvation, while families did the only thing they still could... ...until they couldn't even do that anymore. Eugene hid away in the abandoned family barn. He would daydream about his destiny, fantasizing about a life like his heroes... ...the outlaws and adventurers he read about. Phoebe, come back here! I suppose no one warned Eugene about what can happen when you dream about something so much. That's how Allison Wells entered this story... ...like a bat out of hell... headed straight... for my brother. Roadblock for me, would you? Look at this cold bastard. I bet he'd be in bed with a different broad every night if he were real. I bet he knows exactly the right thing to say to a girl to make her crazy. That's all it takes really... words. Unless you live in a dead old town like this. Amen to that. Hey, what's going on? Harold, he'll tell you all about it. - Check it out? - Mm-hmm. All right, folks, we got some things need to be said. So, y'all quiet down now so that they can be heard. Ma'am? During their raid on a Missouri bank, the thief and murderer, Allison Wells, sent a nine-year-old little girl to heaven. Nine years old. And that was just one of five human souls that were taken on that day. If you see this woman, do not confront her. She will not hesitate to take another life. Now, all and all, she's just one little lady with half the Texas law enforcement trying to find her. And find her we shall. Is this real, this reward? Ten thousand dollars if we find her? You're Deputy Evans' boy, ain't you? Yes, sir. He's my stepfather. Well, I appreciate your interest, son, but we've already got all the help we need from the Evans family, so just run on home. Search party meeting at church after the service. God and coincidence cannot occupy the same Earth. We know this, ladies and gentlemen, for where there is a sign, there is the hand of God. And our community is under his palm now. And now we see why... women like Allison Wells... Eugene. What a drag. Ready to go? Eugene? Hey, Joe. - I want you at home today. - Why? With that Wells lady on the loose, it's not safe around these parts. We're going with the search party, Ma. We'll be safe. We'll look after each other, all right? You have my word. Mmm, home by dark. - Yes, ma'am. - And stick together. Give me that. - Can I come? - No, you cannot. - By dark. - Yeah. Can you even imagine having that much money? I sure as hell can. Can't you? No, not really. I bet you actually can't neither. Fighting words, Evans. Hell, you best give me your share so as I don't whup ya. I will die of laughing before you whip me, boy. Think we'll find her dead? I don't know. Probably. You okay? - Hey? What's the matter? - Nothing. Come on, tell me. What's up? We're going to California. They told us this morning. Said we are giving up on Texas. Shit, man. How long you going for? Well, forever. I mean, when you think about it, why would we come back? Yeah. Guess you'll have to find someone else to bitch to. Ain't no one I'd rather bitch to than you, Garza. - Can you handle that? - Let go, you jackass! No. I gotta get it in before you go. Yeah. Come get me! Come get me! I'm gonna miss you, buddy. Come on! Come on! Let's go! What you gonna do? I'm faster than you, boy. I always have been. You really think we're going to find her in all this? It's worth a try. I said "before dark." George wants to talk to you. You're in trouble. His request. You wanted to see me? A mother's word... is law. When a mother tells a son to do something, he does it. Always. That's how families work. Good times and bad. We understand each other? Yeah... Uh, yes, sir. What you got there? Nothing. Do us both a favor. Don't act like you think I'm stupid. What money from what job did you pay for that garbage? See, your mother may let you off easy, but I can't. There's no room for boys in this family anymore. Think about that. Wash up. Lights out. Don't make a sound. Don't! It's yours if you want it. What's your name? - I'm Allison. - I know who you are. Well, then it's only fair that I know who you are. Uh... Eugene. Eugene. That's a smart name. Ain't that you? Huh? - They said you was a killer. - I'm not a killer. Eugene... I'm gonna be real frank with you. I'm trying to maintain composure, but this hole in my leg is hurting like a motherfucker right now. So, if you help me, I'll tell you everything. Listen to me. Eugene, listen to me. I'm not a killer. You still wouldn't believe my story. Just like one of these books. Except I'm the man in the hat. Wow. Not bad. All right. Oh, Jesus. Looks worse than it is. All right. Got steady hands, kid? I think you should see a doctor or something. No, no, no. You're my doctor now, okay? Dr. Eugene. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. Clean your hands with that. Okay. Everything's gonna be fine, all right? Okay. Get the tweezers. Clean them. Okay. You sure you didn't kill nobody? No. - Okay. - All right. Uh... Get the, uh... Rinse the alcohol on... right smack on it. Just pour it all on. Holy shit! Holy shit! Okay. Give me the flashlight. Okay. Can you see the bullet? Yeah, yeah. I think so. Okay, take it out. It's okay. Okay. Uh, think of something nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bandage it up. - Okay, I'll hold it on. Yeah. - Hold it. Okay. You okay? Yeah. It feels good. That was amazing. Uh, you thirsty? And he's a mind reader too. I'll be right back. As fate would have it, Allison had lost her own family and farm in Missouri one year previous. Her mother and father had both succumbed to pneumonia. Now, I have no intention of painting Allison Wells as a liar, as others have, but I will say she understood who her audience was and told her story accordingly. How old are you? Uh, 25. Uh-huh. You got a girlfriend, Mr. 25? Well... park yourself. I guess I should explain things. I appreciate your caution, kid, but... right now, if you wanted, you could break me in two. It's true I robbed that bank. And it wasn't the first. I never killed anybody. Well, if you didn't, then who did? According to the story Allison told Eugene that night, she was the victim of this whole affair. After her land was taken and her family passed, she became an outlaw. It was her only way of taking something back. Which brought her to the Guthrie Plains bank robbery. It had been her fourth robbery that month, but it was the first with any loss of life. The fact, she insisted, was solely the police's fault. Those cops, they got scared. The second we came out of that bank, they started firing. Didn't matter that there was still people on the street and in the sidewalk. Her claim was a stray bullet from the police ended the life of that innocent little girl. It was straight out of one of Eugene's stories. - They're hunting me. - Her... stealing back the memory from a world that had taken everything... ...and left her with nothing... ...and no one. That's why I need you, 'cause I don't have anyone else. You can stay here as long as you need a room. - As long as you want. - Thank you. I'm sorry. It's okay. Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you for more than I know is fair. How much would it be worth to you to help me get to Mexico? Mexico? How does $20,000 sound? That's double your bounty. That's the point. You got that much on you? I don't have a nickel. But I know my way around a bank, even a Mexican one. And I can have you that money before you even know I'm gone. All you need to do is get me a car. Well, that ain't an easy thing to get around here. Especially with an empty wallet. Maybe I'm wrong, but you seem like a pretty capable fella. I need a few days to rest up. And if you apply yourself to our problem between now and then, well, then, I'd say we're in business, wouldn't you? I've seen your fields, Eugene. I know your family's in trouble, same as mine was. I mean, if there's a simpler way to fix things for you, I don't have the faintest what that would be. I could turn you in. Sure. You could. But, Eugene, and I say this with all seriousness and sincerity. If that's the choice you make, and it is your choice to make, have no illusions of the consequences. I won't be another victim of their lies. I'd rather die by my own hand. Or yours. This is a land of burden, kid. Right now, you get to pick yours. Makes you one of the lucky ones. - Why are you naked? - Shh! Okay, but... what the hell? Don't worry about it, okay? And don't swear. I ain't worried. I'm curious. Don't be. All right, just go back to sleep. Come on. You're heading into town today. Look for some work. Take your sister with you. Yes, sir, okay. And gear up. They're saying it's a windy one. Hey. - Hi. - I thought you might want to change. It's perfect. I hope it fits okay. It's my mother's. She don't wear it much, so she shouldn't notice it's gone. She'll notice. Maybe she'll come in here looking for it. What, in here? No, no. They ain't got much use for this since the drought started. Okay. Thank you. Oh, excuse me. - What are you looking at? - Uh, nothing. You're supposed to take me to town. - Yeah, well, I'm busy. - You ain't. - I am. - What were you looking at? Nothing. I was just seeing how it looked in there, that's all. I ain't dumb. What's in there? Ain't nothing in there. Christ! Okay, I'll tell you if you promise me you ain't gonna go in there and look for yourself. I don't want Mama or George going in there until I clean it up. Clean up what? You promise? Yeah, tell me. Two dead dogs. Lying there with their blood and their guts all in the dirt. Flies all around. Dogs? Whose dogs? Nobody's. The blue yonder's. What killed 'em? Coyotes or something. How should I know? That's sad. That's life. Wait, where you going now? Going to meet Joe Garza. - What about? Can I come? - Nothing and no. Hey, Eugene Why the hell you drag me out here, Evans? I got some private words for you, Garza. You know, I thought we was gonna look for that woman today. So I got up butt-crack of dawn. And then you don't even show. Now this. How long have I known you? - Years and years, by my count. - You stand by me. And in those years, I've gone and trusted you. Okay? And that's why what I'm about to ask might seem unfair, but it could save both our necks. Spit it out. I need your family's truck... for good. I'll send you the money as soon as I get to Mexico. You getting stupid on me, Eugene? We are leaving in it next week. What the hell's going on? I can't tell you everything right now, but I've met somebody. And they're gonna pay me 20,000 to get them to Mexico. Twenty-thousand! Do you believe it? No, Evans, I don't. And even if I did, shit, I'd tell you to eat a toad. If you're saying what I think you're saying, then me just saying it could wind me dead. No, no, no. No one's gonna wind up dead. They're chasing me out of town enough as it is. Imagine. A murdering white lady too? Two dead dogs. Dinnertime. What's wrong? Any luck with the automobile? No, not yet. I'm still trying. Are you gonna tell me what's eating you? I need to get out of here, Eugene! Yeah, I know that. - Did something happen? - No. Something could. It's not safe, me being here. It's not safe for anyone. Yeah, I know. Just... - I'm going crazy in here. - I'm cooped up. I'm hurt. I'm dirty. - Yeah. - I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't mean to yell at you. Sorry. I may have just thought of something that will cheer you up. What's that? You can wash here. This is a clean swimming lake. Property's abandoned, so, we're safe. We can clean your leg and then dress it after. How about that? All right then. We're leaving in five minutes. Hey, that's for later. I couldn't resist. Sit down. Where is Eugene? I'm missing my blue dress. Have you seen it anywhere? Um, no, Mama. Hello? Anyone hear me? I said, "Where is the boy"? Him and Joe was out looking for work. He said you told him to. Said he's going to meet us there. Where are your shoes? Do I have to wear them? Yes. Come on. Oh! Hello. Evening. What are you staring at? Oh, nothing. I was, uh... I was just thinking about my father. He took me swimming here once when I was real little. I'd forgotten about it until just now. He ain't around anymore. You must miss him pretty bad, huh? Yeah, I suppose so. When I wonder what I miss about him, I can't think of nothin'. You know, I just can't remember. It's funny. Do you ever get that? You know what the worst part of dying is, kid? I didn't say he was dead. But... when you quit it with all this "kid" crap, you can tell me. You don't like it when I call you kid? No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I didn't mean it like you're a kid. I meant it like... Billy the Kid. You know him? The outlaw. The myth. Yeah, I know him, but I... I don't like it either way. And why is that? Well, 'cause what's the big hoopla about some dummy that got himself killed before the age of 30, huh? This ain't about when he died. It's about how long he'll live. You see, the worst part of dying... is being forgotten. That's why I like Billy. 'Cause even though he died before 30, every couple of years someone claims to have seen him. You know, at the groceries or riding a freight train. He's like a ghost out of time. You see, you can't really die if people still want you to live. Not in any meaningful way, at least. - Hey! You! - I thought you said this place was safe. - Damn it! - He was supposed to be off this land by now. This is still my land until the first of next month! Shit. Go, go, go. Go! I don't think he saw. We got to... Hey. Have you seen my brother? Can I pinch a smoke, please, sir? - You got a light? - Yeah. Thank you, sir. I'm telling you, they should be sending out search parties still. Damn sure she's still here with a wound like that. I hope so. A little excitement never hurt no one. A little excitement never hurt no one, huh? You seen the evidence, Ernie? Nah, I'm just saying. Well, I have. All of it. And let me tell you something. She don't tend to leave no witnesses. All kinds of horrors in that evidence locker. You hear Hartwell talking in there? He said he saw her just a couple hours ago. Swimming in that lake of his. Everybody keeps claiming they've seen her. That's why we gotta get all the farmers together, and we got to search. Splitting the bounty won't save everyone, but it will some of us, Ernie. I told Ethel I'd dance with her to this one. There's my girl. You gonna dance with your pa? Shall we, little lady? Whoo-hoo! You might be the worst damn thief I think I've ever seen. Shit, Garza, you almost gave me a coronary. Run a block, would you? Hell you think I'm doing? Your daddy would've beat your ass in public already if it weren't for me. He ain't my daddy. Bingo. You are up to some fishy shit, Eugene Evans. Yeah, you have no idea. Ride your bike here? Sit down. Come on. Mm-hmm. - Yeah! - Uh-huh! Ohh! Punch it! Whoa! You ain't supposed to be in here. I'm sorry, sir. I was just getting this for my... for my old man. - He wanted to take a look at it at home. - Who's your old man? Uh, Deputy Evans. - I have his keys. - You're Eugene Evans? Uh, yeah, sir. Yeah. Well, George knows better, but, uh, I understand he's got a bug up his ass about this whole situation we got here. Yeah, yeah. Sure has, yeah. All right, well, take him what he needs. - Yes, I will, sir. Thank you. - All right. Hey. Tell your ma I say hi. Yes, sir. You found her, ain't ya? The Wells lady. I ain't going to tell nobody, if that's what you're worried about. - You ain't? - Not if you tell me why you've been such a creeping, little toad lately. It's complicated. Complex. I'm scared. I know. It scares me too. Everything's gonna be all right. I promise. Show me that smile. - Come on. You want a ride back? - Yeah. Okay. Three, two, one. I saw a change in my brother that night. There was a resolve in his eyes I'd never seen before. Like something invisible that had tied him to our world came undone and set off a series of events that would change the shape of our family forever. Maybe if I'd known his father, I would have recognized that look. Sheriff wants to see you in his office. I'm looking for him too, Janice. - George. - What's up? Sir, she is still here. I found that on the edge of the Hartwell property after he claimed that he had seen her. And no one's safe until we find her. Now, the way I see it, is if we raise the bounty, we could get every farmer and every farmhand in the county on her ass. What the fuck do you think I brought you in here for? - Huh? - You send your boy in here at night to steal evidence and expect me not to fire your ass? Where you been, kid? I know about Perry Montroy. You lied about him. You could be lying about everything. I didn't... I didn't tell you about him because it's hard to talk about. Was you in love with him? Are you jealous? Yeah. I've never seen anything like it. You're right. It ain't safe for you here. Or for any of us, for that matter. You said 20,000, right? Find me a car, and I'm history. Same as your family debt. Oh, shit. George is back early. Sheriff cut me loose. You know why? The evidence you took, where is it? - It's gone. - Gone where? I forget. Okay, all that stuff was lies and made-up nonsense! Where in God's creation you get the idea of calling that woman innocent? - Well, I know things. - Oh, you "know things"! The apple don't fall far from the tree, now, does it? Full of foolish thoughts, like your old man. Well, I may have raised you, but you sure as shit ain't my son. Well, thank God for that. Son of a... Where is it, huh? Huh? You're gonna break your mama's heart when you end up dead like John Baker. But he ain't dead. He's in Mexico. I'm gonna find him one day. Sure. Mexico. And this door, from here on out, stays open. Shit. Come on. Shit. Shit. Come on. Don't stop now. Oh, God. It's fine. It's fine. I'm seeing stars, Allison. No. No! No, no, you can make it. Come on. We can make it. Come on. Keep running. No. No. I'll see you in Mexico. Jesus. Hey, Papa. Glad you're home. What's wrong now? No, you ought to stay inside. If he's hiding it, it's in that barn. Don't. That boy needs his mother. Maybe he'll tell you what the hell is going on. George, he's sorry what happened. But he told me what you did. Just trying to help. Help who? George was dismissed. Eugene, look at me. We're less than a month away from being homeless. George said John Baker was dead. And he was right. Do you remember that postcard he wrote you when you were six? Of course, I do. Yeah, well, he sent more. But I burned every one of them after the first. Every month, he'd write, and every month, each card was worse than the last. They'd be full of talk about God and people and strange things he'd seen, but it was all jumbled up. He was drinking himself to death, and his mind was falling apart. I couldn't let a little boy read what he wrote. I only lied because I love you. - You're lying to me now, Mama. - No, Eugene, I'm not. After five years, the cards stopped. And I believe that was 'cause he died. No. No, you can't be sure of that. You can't. Eugene! Eugene, I... I'm sorry. Oh, God. He shut that door? I did. He say anything meaningful about what he done? No. I need your help with this, George. He ain't going nowhere. That day came to be known as "Black Sunday." It was the worst storm Childress County had ever seen. And for Eugene, just the sign he needed. Phoebe... I'm leaving. Okay, I'm going. I'm here to say goodbye. Take me with you. You don't even know where we're going. That don't matter. Phoebe, we're going to Mexico. Mexico. I'll learn Spanish, okay? No. You gotta stay here. I'm gonna send money. I'm gonna send lots of it. - Where you getting money? - Well, that don't matter, does it? This is a good thing. Why you doing this? I guess I'm in love. You don't know anything about love. You don't neither. I know that if you loved us, you'd stay. - If you loved me. - Phoebe, I do love you. Well, then stay. I'll see you soon. I promise. Just go. Quit drawing it out. I held my breath that whole night... and I imagined I was him... laying in the same bed after his father left. Once the storm passed, George checked the barn. But to his disappointment, he found nothing. Food's ready. Can you wake the boy? Gene? Oh, shit! Oh... He went away with that lady. What lady? What are you talking about? Allison Wells, the fugitive. Why are you saying that? Because I'm telling the truth. The damn truck's gone. Papa! Papa, Phoebe here's been saying strange things about her brother. I want you to tell her they isn't true. What things she been saying? She says Eugene's been helping Allison Wells, the fugitive? But that just isn't possible. It's just a little girl's fantasy. - Isn't it? - No, it ain't. Phoebe, you best tell us where he's gone. You don't want your brother to get hurt, now, do you? I'm gonna miss you, but I hate goodbyes. You should pull over soon. We don't draw this one out. No, no, no. There ain't gonna be any goodbyes. You don't gotta fret about it. Oh, no. Kid, no. I'm going to Mexico alone. Afraid not. Afraid so. What about your family? You just gonna leave 'em? You know what, Allison? I've got family in Mexico too. Your father. Right. John Baker. High damn time I track him down. I don't think you understand what it entails to find somebody, let alone in Mexico. What does it matter to you if I come to Mexico or not, huh? - It matters 'cause you're in love with me, and you expect... - No. No. No, I ain't. You know what, Allison? Last night I said to myself, there is no way in hell that you're going to Mexico by yourself. There ain't. So, whether you love me back or not is besides the point. I don't love you back. Well... it's a long drive. God, what did I do wrong? How did they come across one another? I don't know, but if word gets out that that woman was hiding here, and I'm not the one to bring her in... Makes me sick to even think about. You think I care right now about any of that? What's gonna happen to my son, George? I'm calling Tade, and I'm calling Lomax. We're gonna find him before anyone else does. Tade? George Evans. Have you still got that buck shooter? - Don't shoot my son, George! - Hey! Ain't no one getting shot until he's free and clear. All right, Tade, bring the vehicle. Mine's on the fritz. We stand to get a third of the bounty. - Then we can stay. - Just bring my son back to me, or you don't bother coming back. Goddamn it. Turn back, you bastard. What do we do, Allison? Do you have the gun? - No, we ain't using... - Please, tell me you have the gun. We ain't using it though, right, Allison? Not if we don't have to, but we do have to pull over. Shit. I want to report a car stolen. Yeah. License plate number 3285M8. What's the problem, sir? Well, the problem is you ran a clearly placed stop sign. You leave your good sense at home, son? Oh, uh, no, sir. I'm sorry. I didn't see the stop sign till it was too late, that's all. Where you headed and why? I'm going to Lubbock. Gonna pick up a part for my old man. His tiller's broke, so... Who's your old man? John Baker of Bismark. I don't know him. You know, there's a fugitive about. A lady. All armed and ready to kill. Yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, she ain't the kind of folk that I associate with, so I ain't seen her. If I do, I'll be sure to let the authorities know. What's your name, son? I'm gonna write you a citation, then you're free to go. Uh, Eugene Baker. Slow down. I will. Thank you, sir. You fucking did it! That's right. Well, you may not be the worst person to go on a trip with after all. - Mama? - Huh? Eugene has to have someone looking out for him. More than just Papa. Hmm? What the hell you saying? No, you're not setting foot outside this house till this is over. Not another word on that. Just go to your room. Close the door. Morning, Mrs. Evans. Eugene's going to be A-okay. Evans. Uh-huh. Is that so? Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just my boy. Sorry for the mix-up. I'll handle it myself. I appreciate that. They're near Matador, heading south. Someone must've reported my truck stolen. Let's go, boys. Phoebe? Come here. Phoebe! Phoe... Phoebe. No, no, no, no. No! Come back! You ain't gonna believe the green when we get out of these forsaken parts. There's rivers of it, just rolling and rolling. I'm telling you, there's, like, bright green orchards... bright blue waters. I've seen a tree before, you know? Yeah, well, have you seen the ocean? No. No, I haven't. I used to dream a lot about it when I was a kid. Not sure exactly what it's supposed to look or feel like, though. Have you seen it? No, but I used to dream about it too. I plan on running into its big, burly arms when we get to Mexico. Yeah, that sounds nice. Yeah. Phoebe. Hi, Papa. No. No, you should stay here. No, thank you. I need to stretch my leg. Allison, the clerk might recognize you. And once we're gone, he'll tell everyone how pretty I was. Here, take this with you. Let's just see what we're working with here. - Evening. - Evening yourself, handsome. How are you doing on this lonesome night? Can't complain. Sign says you have vacancies. That's right. One room or two? One. You're Room 17. You're too kind. Thank you, sir. That was the last of our money. Yep. We'll get more. I'm gonna shower. Hey, kid. Why don't you come in here? Ah, God, feels like heaven. You want to shower? You afraid? No. Are you embarrassed? Why do you want me in there with you? What do you mean "why"? That's a funny question. Seems reasonable enough to me. Jesus, you want me to drag you in? Thinking too hard about this, kid. There it is again. I'm "kid," but that dingbat behind the desk, he's "handsome"? You need me to call you handsome? No, I... I just... Did I ask the dingbat behind the desk to get in the shower with me? Well, maybe if he was here, you would. Wow. Fuck you. All I'm saying... All I'm saying is, I don't know if you actually want me here or... are you just saying that because you're trying to get me to stick around 'cause you're afraid I'll turn you in. You wouldn't be here if I didn't want you here. You know that as well as I do. I apologize. Thank you. But I need to make something crystal-fucking-clear. This was your choice. I didn't ask you to come. Okay? You insisted. And you talk a great game. And hell, I'm accustomed to your company. But if you have any doubts about being here right now, you need to go home. Go home. Be a kid again. Okay? 'Cause every second you spend here, that option gets slimmer and slimmer. You understand that, right? This ain't a world for kids. It's ugly. Ugly. I ain't going nowhere. I want to reach the ocean with you. Your skin's so soft. Okay? I'm sorry. I think I need some sleep. Have you ever done this before? - No. - Lay down. You okay? Yeah. You sure? I just wanna... I want to be good. Okay, I'll show you. I don't really know what's gonna happen now, but... can you, um... Can you just close your eyes? - Why? - Just... close 'em. I think you should have it. You don't like it? Won't it remind you of him? You seeing me wearing it? Wherever Perry is, the last thing he needs is a watch. Besides, I want it to remind me of someone else. I believe that Allison Wells did come to love my brother back. And that she was truthful, for the most part. Maybe it's on account of how badly I miss Eugene... but I've always imagined that, for a moment, the world appeared before him the way he always dreamed it would. In that moment, Eugene and Allison were bound together by the dream. One they believed they were in control of. I never been too concerned with whose idea the next part was. It never really mattered much to me. There are certain conditions to the life Eugene dreamed of that I'm sure Allison wished she could have kept secret from him. Prices she hoped to have paid for the both of them. There's no going back. Okay? We're in and we're out. Two minutes is all it takes. Keep an eye on that watch. Kiss me. Count to five. Pardon me. I'm going to need that. This is a holdup! Everybody kiss the ground! Shut up! Shut up! Get on the goddamn floor! I don't need you back there, ma'am. Get out. - Everybody, calm down! - You can stay. Please, this is a family bank. - I'm not falling for that, lady. - We ain't insured. Everybody, calm down! Everybody! Tell 'em! Tell 'em now! Do it. Do as you're told. What now, Allison? You know what to do, ma'am. Faster you go, the faster we leave. - Please, hear me. We are not... - Oh, I hear you. Now, hear me. I want you to open that little safe back there. Me and my partner can get out of your hair. Come on! How's it going over there, Allison? Tell him how good it's going, lady. Good! Good! It's going good! That's right. Real good, kid. It's going well. It's going okay. Everybody, just do as you're told. Stay down. It's going to be over before you know it, okay? Thank you. That will be all, folks. Allison! Eugene, come on. Go! Just breathe. Come on, Eugene. We can't stop. - We can't... not till we get to Mexico. - You gotta pull over. Pull over! Eugene, please. Eugene? Eugene, please, we really gotta keep going. Kid, we gotta move. Kid, please, get in the car. One dead. Citizens Pride Bank in Stanley. Two fugitives, including Allison Wells, are heading south on 281. South, black truck on 281. License plate number 3285M8. - I repeat... - That's them. Goddamn! I can imagine how you're feeling right now, and I know that feeling ain't about to go away, but you need to have that feeling in the car, or we're gonna get our asses killed. He should have just stayed lying there. Yeah, he should've, but he got arrogant, and he got stupid. I wasn't even thinking. I just... I just did it. Because you had to. Eugene, it would have been me otherwise. And if someone had to die today, I'm sure glad that choice was yours. A man is dead because of me. I know. I know how you feel. I know how you feel, but we need to move. You need to get in the car, Eugene. Allison, I don't think you understand. I don't think I can do this. - I do understand... - You don't! I understand! Maybe "I understand" doesn't mean I'm just gonna sit down and wait to die myself. How would you understand? Eugene, please. Please, get in the goddamn car. Who did you kill, Allison? You're everything they said you was, ain't ya? - I don't know if it was me who killed her. - How could you not know? Because it was happening all at the same time. If you weren't there, would that girl still be alive today? You made me into something that I ain't. I didn't make you into anything you didn't already want to be. Eugene. Please. Eugene! Ain't that your truck? Eugene! Stay here with her. Eugene, we can still get to Mexico. Don't you want to find your father? He's gone, Allison! He's dead. I ain't gonna find nobody! This is goodbye. Don't shoot me. Phoebe, get in the car! Go. If you want the bounty, you can take me in and get it. Or we can stick to the plan. I said, get in the car. But Eugene's out there. I won't let nothing happen to him. I promise. It's all right. It's all right. Stay here. Either way, I'm leaving it up to you. I'll tell them I made you do everything. You can go on with your life. You got to pick your burden, kid. Hey. I never wanted to lie to you. I told you all the truths I knew how to. And I am who you thought I was. It's a little more complicated is all. I'm scared, Allison. Yeah, me too. I'd rather be scared with you than alone. Please. We can baptize ourselves in the ocean. Let's go. Eugene! Get out of the way! We can make it. Run, Eugene! No! No! Allison! Oh! Oh! Allison. Oh, my God. No. It's over, son. Put your guns down. Put 'em down! It's all right, son. Put your guns down! Put it down! I said put the gun down! On the ground! Run, Eugene! That was the last time any of us saw Eugene. We don't know where he went or if he got there... but I never tried to find him. That was never my destiny. Different fathers, I suppose. But I do what I can to keep the legend of Eugene Baker alive. And with the tools left for me, that true and honest absence that John left him and he gave to me, I tell his story. The last time I saw my brother was 20 years ago on April 16th, 1935... The first day it rained in almost a year. Maybe a sign that Eugene found what he was looking for.
