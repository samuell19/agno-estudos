(gentle music) (rocket blast) (distant explosions) (distant explosions) I'm going to put a map on the table, if I may, just to make the points. You want me to hold it? - Let me just put it here. We think there are 150.000 people here. 400.000 civilians in the Old City. In this part of Western Mosul still under the control of ISIL... probably another 100.000 people. So under the control of ISIL, as many as half a million civilians. This is genuinely uncharted territory. But trust me we bend over backwards... to minimise the damage to civilian population and infrastructure. There is an aspiration... that the Iraqi's like to complete the liberation of West Mosul before Ramadan. That would clearly be fantastic. When we were doing our scenario planning for Mosul... our worst case was that a million people would come out. That was our worst case. We are right now at half of that. We have always been very clear that humanitarians of the government... nor partners will be able to cope with that. Part of the reason, ambassador, we are thankful you convene this meeting, because... that is staring at us. The worst case is staring at us. (water splashing) (baby laughing and crying) Bring a chair up. In this area we have five camps. Four are open... and one will be opened next week. If the next camp is open, how many tents do you have? 1560 tents. 1560... - Tents. If you see the number we have about 13.000 families. 13.588. We can say 13.000 families in these camps. Where are we going? Are we walking or driving? (laughter) Shall we take off our shoes? - It's okay, don't worry. Hello. - Hello. This is the ambassador, a very important person. He lives in a country far away. So when IS has left and things are calm in Mosul and you return... what are you looking forward to? Soon you'll go back, I am sure. What do you want to be when you grow up? A beautiful woman. - That's a good idea. And what do you want to be? Where is my... He doesn't speak. Yeah. Thank you. Bye. You are not coming? - No, have a good trip. And a lot of strength the coming days. Thank you. I heard you were allowed to come, but no? No. Thank you for this. Your excellency, I would love to have a whatsapp from you with the pictures. Thank you for all the help. We'll be in touch. Bye bye. Let's move now to operational issues. We have a bunch of them... including the situation with the bridges. Ruben, you want to talk us through operational matters? To start with the bridges. The bridges have been down... for at least 24 hours. And we only have enough supplies... how many people came out yesterday? For how many people do we have supplies? When are we in trouble? In two or three days based on the current outflows. Stocks of tents for example. We have approximately 3000. Can we talk about the chemical attacks? We are at a total of 92 suspect cases. The federal police have accused IS of using chemical weapons. Including incidents in the last 72 hours with exposure to coalition forces. Thanks. And welcome back. Anything else? Good, thanks, see you in a day or two. The Americans... or the coalition doesn't know what to do. I get that, but we got to find a way to overcome this. I think the problem is as follows... I think that the military still sees this as a civilian catch problem. What do you do with the civilians that flee? How do we catch them? For humanitarians the fundamental issue is: how do we tell the civilians what to do? Do we tell them to stay? Or do we tell them to go? What is the best for civilian protection? How do we save the most lives? Okay, cheers. Bye. There is a possibility that we see Aedel tomorrow. I need to work on this. I am working on the press statement. Okay. This doesn't make sense. We have got 400.000 in the Old City. We have a 150.000 in areas which have been retaken. And we have got another 100.000 in the neighbourhoods that haven't been retaken. So unless if my math is completely off, that is a lot more than 500.000. It is 400.000 plus a 150.000 plus another 100.000... it's 650.000 people still in Western Mosul. That sounds right if you add them up. You are the guys on the ground. Tell me what is going on! These are government figures. The estimated population currently displaced... leads us to a figure of 500.000... in inaccessible areas. That is ISIS controlled areas. Alright: the UN estimates that as many as 500.000 people remain in ISIL controlled areas? Including 400.000 in the densely populated Old City. Is that a correct statement? Yeah, that's correct. Okay, that makes more sense to me. The heart of the matter is the protection of civilians. Whether the prime minister says: you stay or you go... because he has to make a judgement call. Because the Old City is entirely encircled. So we need a judgement call. All of the other issues are subsidiary issues. (crying) We are literally in the dying hours of the Mosul battle. And I think increasingly thoughts will turn to: what next. The number of people who are being displaced... and the pace of their displacement... there is nothing else comparable in the world. We have calculated the damage and loss assessments... for the first phase of stabilisation. Housing. The cost of immediate stabilisation: 87 million. Roads and bridges: 70 million. Sewerage: 7 million. Getting the roads cleaned and opened: 107 million. Electricity: 150 million. Water: 12. What is the total? - The total is 707 million. I know. Estimates on demining? No, we don't have demining yet. We don't know how much contamination there is. How much would it cost to put things back up? It is not reconstruction. This is first phase stabilisation. I am good. How are you, sir? We'll be over here. They don't normally compliment me for accusing the government of corruption. Sorry, madam... - Excellency, good morning. How are you, excellency? What is the date? - Today is the 19th. The 19th. Thank you very much. - Excellency, thank you. We have given our promise to the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people... that you can count on us. That we will do everything we can... to bring people back to their homes. So they can restart their lives. The document that we've just signed with doctor Al-Allaq... authorises the UN to accelerate work on 202 stabilisation projects... in Eastern Mosul and in the Nineveh Plains areas that have been liberated from IS. That is important. Without that authorisation we would not move forward. Do you think I can see his excellency for two minutes? Is that possible? Excellency, can I see you for two minutes? - Yes. It's the issue of... nerve agents. Do you know about this? - No. Okay. Two federal police... were treated at a World Health Organisation hospital in Mosul. They have the symptoms of a nerve agent. Not a blistering agent, a nerve agent. Very, very serious. Can you send me any...? - You have to ask me. Someone from the Ministry of Health has to ask me, the UN... and then I will give you the samples. You know the difference between a nerve agent and a chemical? No. - Okay. A chemical or blistering agent is mustard gas, chlorine. It is superficial. A nerve agent affects your head. It's terrible. We think the government should ask us for the samples... so that I can give them to you. But you have to ask me for them. It is a slow and deliberate process. It can take hours. No problem. Hello. Mine Action Group and some of the others take care of fields and explosive belts. We are taking care of schools, water sources, power sources... whatever it takes to get the city back up and running... so that the people can come back. That is our concern based on our donorship. They are devious when it comes to hiding the stuff. They put it even in toys. - Exactly. This is just a vacuum cleaner, but right here there is a micro switch. When people rehabilitate their houses they would pick it up... and it would detonate. This is one of the big killers we have. They come in different size and shapes. These are pressure plates we have uncovered. They would normally bury these. They learned how to weather proof them by putting them in these houses. We found hundreds of these together. Somebody steps on it or drives over it, and... Once cities are liberated, people don't want to wait. They want to go home. Back to their normal life. Thanks for the warm welcome. Let me ask a simple question. I would appreciate it if you could answer. What is needed to make you and other students feel happy one year from now? The international community made mistakes in Iraq. That is one side of the coin. We have a responsibility towards the Iraqi people. The other side to the coin is... changes, peace and prosperity has to come from within Iraq. A number of purposes. I can read reports about the Mosul situation... but in order to be well informed, it is important to meet people like you. Everybody is asking the international community to provide funds... but in principle Iraq is not a poor country. If all the leaders would really work... for peace and welfare of the people of Iraq you would not need international help. I would like to say that I respect and appreciate your reaction. I appreciate if you are critical about the international community... but 202 projects under this stabilisation program of the UN... could not start in the past months. You know why? Because responsible Iraqi officials wanted... the contracts to go to their friends and companies. How are you, excellency? It's a pleasure to see you. How did I do? It went well. There was a funny moment after his second intervention. Then you sort of like... both did this wolf eating grin at one another. That was quite funny. Knowing... Knowing the background. - Yes. I just kept thinking... "Thank you, thank you, awesome, amazingly well." "What's your father doing?" My father - My father. He is driver. - He is driver. He is driver. Driver. - Driver. What's your father doing, Ala'? My... - My... father... - father... is taxi driver. - is taxi driver. Driver. - Driver. Hello, everybody. Where is Mounir? Oh there. Hi, Mounir. Mounir and I would like to welcome you to this staff meeting. Do you know the statistic that 70 percent of countries that come out of conflict... are back in it in five years? This is a really scary statistic. This period now IS is expelled is highly sensitive for Iraq. If mishandled unfortunately we can see things go the wrong way. And that is what nobody wants. The prime minister has asked for stabilisation to keep going... for as long as possible. But that is not what the donors want. The donors want stabilisation to conclude as quickly as possible. So you don't take a stabilisation instrument, designed for stabilisation... and extend it into reconstruction. You need different instrument for that. The donors want that distinction to be clear. That has now been agreed with the donors and with the government. One year after the last city is liberated... then the facility of stabilisation will be closed. And we will be requesting that the donors step forward and provide... 700 million of funding to the UN development program. If you think what I said before that the funding facility will last for only... one year after the last town is liberated. And you think about the 700 million dollars we are going to ask. That means that we have to spend money... really fast. If we would ask our country office now to spend 700 million in that amount of time... we would probably break apart. We have got to make sure that the right changes are in place... so we can try and do our best... and do as much work that is required in Western Mosul as possible. So this is the substation. - Yes. Really? Wow. So it were six rockets that hit this? Do you know whose rockets they were? So what are we going to do when we repair? What is the plan? 4,7 million. - 4,7 million for this? I can't remember if I repair this god damn thing or not. I think I promised. I can't remember either. How many...? 3 hospitals and 17 health centers? This one is included, with two more. And 17 public health centers. We are pleased to confirm that there are 3 hospitals... 17 primary health centers... because we want to confirm we will do all the things you have asked. And I can confirm we will work on this immediately. I promise. So this is a request to add electricity and generators? Is the grid going to be up? Or do we need a mobile one? We are doing a generator in the back. So we can do that? Until the grid is up we will bring in generators. I'll make sure that happens. - This is the most important problem. Of course. You cannot run the health center without electricity. So we can add that? - Yes. Impressive. Well done, Jan. - Well done, right? So the first piece is for Mrs Grande. I will make it a bit bigger. Beautiful cake. - Well done, Jan. The people in their small shops they are painting. This is what supposed to happen. Give them a little bit to kickstart and off they go. All those workers that you see those are all employed by us. They go on for three months they get twenty dollars a day... and that hard US dollars. (children talking) (baby crying) (music and singing) And then Iraq. The UN announced that the head of the humanitarian mission... Lise Grande will leave the country. Grande moves to Yemen... where a ferocious war is being fought since 2015. (music)
