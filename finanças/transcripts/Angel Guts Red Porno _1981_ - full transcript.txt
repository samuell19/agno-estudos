Can just anyone do it instead of you? Yeah. As long it's a woman. lt's very easy. You just have to stand there doing nothing. What are you doing? Please stop it. There must have been a misunderstanding. l only came here to take over for one night. Will you just stop that? Please stop it. No. Won't someone stop him!? No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Hey, stop looking so serious. Let me go. Mr Muraki? Ah. Hello. Don't you know you shouldn't put plastic rubbish out until tomorrow? Sorry. Oh dear, look at her. Isn't she looking beautiful? You must be popular amongst the boys. Hi, Chie. Are you alright? - Alright? - Yeah, fine. Are you going somewhere nice again? - We're getting obsessed. - Really? , When he first came here he had a smile. Just like a shining apple. Now he's worn out because he can't sleep. Experienced sushi chef wanted... ...at the end of this month... RED PORNO RED PORNO Can you alter these, make them a bit longer? Certainly. Would this be long enough? Welcome to our store, Please watch your step, I'm really sorry. Oh, sorry. Are you alright? Yes. How about tonight? Uh... Dinner. It's a Greek restaurant. You'll love it there. But... Can you wait for me at that cafe on the corner when you finish work? l have to go home now. Of course, don't worry. Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm only a bit drunk. Are you alright? You were so drunk. Did l...? Why don't you take a shower to freshen up? Where is it? Come over here, princess? Did you book this room in advance? What do you think? Did you push me into the lift on purpose? l just wanted to get to know you better, because you're the most popular girl in our company, ... but no one's ever dated you. Please excuse me. Are you angry with me, princess? No! Don't! No! l've got to have you. l'll take them off myself. l don't want you to laugh at what you see. I'm not sexy. Don't worry. We're in a hotel room on the 32nd floor. lf an earthquake hits, we'll die together. I'm scared. Moan more. Is it nice? Move your hips more. Hold me tighter. Shall we go to that hotel that has a revolving bed next? Yeah, l've always wanted to go there, You know how sexy your voice sounded? l liked it, Are you comparing me with someone? Who? Look at the TV. - Come on. Just look. - l don't want to. Nami's pussy's sucking my penis in. lt's just like an animal. Look, it's chewing it. Don't be silly. Get a condom for next time. Is your wife alright? She's alright. - What if she finds out? - Hum... yeah? Are you going to tell her that it wasn't serious with me? What!? l told you l was gone on you. lt should have been you. l met you too late to be my wife. Would you try to understand the feelings of a pervert? What kind of question is that? l've had a lot of perverted telephone calls lately. lt's very eerie. Yeah? Ah! How does a pervert who's obsessed with you feel? l can understand that to a degree. Then you're a slut! l haven't worked for Dark Publishing for a long time. But I'm going to do some work for them. Pleasurable work, remember? Do you wanna come with me? No, thank you! Everyone loves your nude pictures. They've received so many enquiries about you from other magazines. - Good morning. - Good morning. Have you seen your nude pictures in the magazine? l don't want to see them. l only want to get that film back. You're not the only one. A lot of girls storm into the office with pimps to get the films back, because they don't want their parents to find out about it. Why don't you do that too with your married boyfriend, Nami? Oops. Sorry! Sorry! Everyone knows about it. Be a bit more clever next time. Did you know the magazine you're has become a best seller and has sold out? You're kidding me? l heard that you're never at home. That ugly looking editor, Sumi, said he'd wanted to contact you. lt seems he called you a couple of times. Hitomi, did you give my number to him? lt's not a big deal, is it? Where are you meeting them tonight? The usual place. l don't like it there. That place is becoming too famous. The weekly magazine wrote about that place as a Mecca of pornography. And there're so many perverts hanging around there. Hey, do you wanna go then? l won't get there on time. l have to do some shopping first. Someone stole underwear from your home, too? Yes, can you believe it? About 20 cases are reported to the police every month! Isn't it scary? They say this kind of thing aggravates things and leads to sexual crimes like rape. Yes, it might even lead to a murder case. Yes, this afternoon there was a documentary on TV about it. Really? Good afternoon. Isn't he creepy? What does he get up to? Whatever he gets up to, it can't be anything good. He's always hanging around here at this time of the day. Do you think he's the one who steals the underwear? lt's very possible. Look at his face. He looks very dubious. - Can you keep an eye on him? - OK. I'm close by at the moment. A driving license? l don't have one. l understand. A man nods busily and wipes off his sweat. When he first came here. He'd never worked before and still had a smile just like a shining apple. He no longer has that smile and he's worn out because he can't sleep. By the end of this month, from the time he came here. An ear of rice could have grown to his chest. Above the top button of his shirt... Aren't you the model in this magazine? Please sign your autograph. Ah, l can't. Excuse me. Please excuse us. RED PORNO Are you really sure about it? Don't you know you could make one or two million yen easily with this job. Nami's not after money. - She did it because she trusted me. - So you say. Your image is very appealing. And you have such a nice body, too. Nowadays there is not much excitement in this industry. lt's so boring. Did you give my number to anyone? Why? l've been getting a lot of perverted telephone calls lately. Is there a pervert stalking you? Such a lonely world, isn't it? Everyone wants someone to talk to. That sad looking guy outside as well. He looks like a guy who's henpecked at home. Are you sympathizing with a pervert!? No, but l read these stories in the magazines so often nowadays, how some women have been assaulted or had their underwear stolen. Do you have a persecution complex? You might be the type. l think l'll be going now. OK, l understand. Why don't you take that magazine with you as a memento? Ladies and gentlemen, this train is leaving, please mind the doors, Nami Tsuchiya. Please come out. l just want to talk to you. Who are you? Say something. l saw you in front of the cafe. Why did you follow me? l sympathize with you, and l don't know why I'm doing this. When l saw you there, l just lost control. Who are you?! l saw the magazine. I'm really not that kind of person! Just five minutes. Let me talk to you? l can understand why you are worried because perverts might call you or write you letters, but I'm not like that. So warm. Just leave me alone. I'm not that kind of woman. I'm not a porn model and never have been. I'm not like that. I'm not that kind of woman. I'm not! Excuse me? l have to lock the toilets shortly. What do you think you are doing in my room? I'm a manager of this apartment. l can come in. Can you please leave now? There's been a lot of female underwear stolen from around here lately. And? And what's more, the daughter of Mr Yamashita who lives across the road, says you often peek into her room. Have you got any evidence? l have a proper girlfriend. Why would l be interested in that school girl? Look at that. You've made a stain on the wall. Are you cleaning the room properly? That was there when l moved in. Leave that magazine here. Hello? Ah, it's you. Were you expecting someone more exciting? Where have you been until this late hour? The store will be closed tomorrow. Do you want to meet me in the afternoon? l've something l need to talk to you about. It's very important. OK, have you bought that stuff l asked you to buy? What's that? That stuff. Ah, condoms? Yes, l bought them. Hey, what are you going to tell me tomorrow? Oh, my wife is coming. See you. Your bath's ready. Don't you have to get up early for a game of golf with your clients? Early bed? Yes. Have you become one of those old men who read these kind of magazines? You must be kidding. One of my colleagues at work loves this kind of stuff and he gave me this one saying it was the best. Pornography in Japan is totally tasteless, isn't it? She's very pretty. Doesn't she look just like those girls who work in your department store? We haven't taken a bath together for so long. Why don't we do that tonight? Are you going to wash me, then? That girl in the magazine. That pretty girl. l've seen her. Where? At your company. Isn't she a sales assistant? So you think one of my staff members has become a porn model? Never. She's not my kind. Are you going home? Yeah. Are you scared of your wife? All wives are scary. So are you going to put some mud on your golf clubs? Oh! You've become an expert. Have you done this with anyone else before? So what did you want to talk to me about? Someone left this on my desk. The model is you, isn't it? Luckily he left it on my desk. But what if someone left it on a managers' desk instead? A friend of mine tricked me into this. l don't care who tricked you. What I'm asking you is, what should l do? What should you do? Should l show it to the manager or keep it secret? Are you threatening me? No, l don't mean it like that. l thought perhaps it would be better if l started seeing you at your home instead. Is this a threat? lt's been quite costly. What with the money l've been giving to you as well. Isn't that natural because we love each other? Why don't you show it to the manager or whoever you want? Come on, Nami. What's wrong? No! OK. l understand. What happens is nothing to do with me! Nothing whatsoever. Who could do this? Is she a porn model? That can't be allowed. I'm wondering what l should do as her supervisor. There's no need for you to take responsibility in this case. She's just a slut. Yes. lt can't be tolerated. Trust is very important in this industry. Lay her off. Of course. She looked nice, though. Come with me. No. You're working at the department store? Have you been following me? What's wrong? Has something happened to you? Stop talking as if you're a friend. Take this umbrella. You should go home now. l just wanted to apologize for having followed you like this. l didn't intend to do anything like that. Leave me alone. l've had just about enough of it. Please be quiet. Someone will hear us. That's all l've got to say to you! Stop it! I'm sick of it. You're the one who keeps following me and makes perverted calls, aren't you? That's not me. l never do things like that! How can you do things like that? And you sent that porn magazine to my company, didn't you!? lt wasn't me. l didn't do it. l wouldn't give this to anyone. Why do you have it!? Nami. No! Stop it! lf l knew your telephone number, l would call you all day. And if l'd known where you live, l would've written you a love letter everyday. What do you want from me? - The girl in that magazine isn't who l am! - That's not the you l fell in love with. Why don't you tear that magazine up then? Red Porno You're hopeless. Why can't you behave normally? Why do you have to torment me? If you get what you want, will you go away? This isn't what l want. This isn't what l hoped would happen. Will you go out with me tomorrow? From the department store? l'll be in front of the store at 7. l'll wait for you! l wasn't going to go back to the department store. Yes! Oi! What are you doing!? She's dead! That's him. That must be him. lt's revenge because she told everyone about him peeping into her room. Who? Who the hell is he!? He's not here. He must've run away. Where the hell is he!? Please don't be silly. What do you think you're doing with that gun? Get your hands off! Stop it! Stop it! There he is. That's him. That's the guy! Tomorrow night at seven. Just one more time. I'm used to being disappointed. Tomorrow night at seven... l want to see her. l want to meet her. l heard that you'd finished. l was fired. You're joking?! I'm gonna have to be careful too. You will be OK. Hitomi. What are you going to do then? I'm going to have a break for a while then start from the beginning again. Waiting for a date? Yeah. Oops. l see. Take care. Let's go shopping sometime. Let me use your staff discount card. Bingo! l was too harsh on him last night, l was going to give him my magazine to make up for it, but I guess that's it, Producer: Yoshihiro Yuki (NCP) Plan: Naoya Narita Original Story and Screenplay: Takashi Ishii Recording: Osamu Onodera Graphic Design: Yoshie Kikukawa Editing: Akimasa Kawashima Music: Hachiro Kai Assistant Director: Takashi Kodama Image Development: Toyo Kenkyujo Production Manager: Akio Hattori Cast: Jun Izumi, Yoko Kurita Yuri Yamashina, Miiko Sawaki Kyoko Ito, Osamu Tsuruoka, Masahiko Abe, Noboru Mitani Noriyuki Kitami, Masakazu Minato, Toshikatsu Matsuo, Akio Matsui Tatsuya Hamaguchi, Michiko Aso Noriko Tasu, Etusko Seki Director: Toshiharu Ikeda THE END
