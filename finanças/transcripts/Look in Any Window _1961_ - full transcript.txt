I look in any window I walk by any open door To see if someone will love me Love me forever Gareth? Gareth, is that you? Eileen? Eileen, is that your father? No, Mother, it was across the street. Mr. Riley's new Jag that Dad sold him. Uh, I was hoping it was your father. Mother, the showroom closes at 9:00. Daddy's never even home before 12:00. I know. He's out demonstrating, but what's he demonstrating? If your father didn't work so hard, we wouldn't have all these luxuries. Luxuries? What about love? Or don't you think that Daddy's running around with other women is wrong? Oh, I'm sorry, Mother, I shouldn't have said that. Infidelity is wrong, Eileen. Turn off the lights when you finish. Mother! Mother! Mother! Gareth, be careful. Hey, stop! Who's out there? Oh, it's me, Gareth. Don't be scared. I was chasing a prowler. I'm a little out of condition. I'm not used to jumping over fences. So why don't you rest a while? Where did he go, Mr. Lowell? Gee, I don't know, boys. I guess he just disappeared. Do you think we should get the cops over here, Mr. Lowell? No, no, no, I'll take care of it. Thanks, men. What about your wife, Mr. Lowell? You want us to tell her where you are? She might get worried. No, thanks just the same, Joe. I'll be home in a minute. Good night, men. Good night, Mr. Lowell. Good night, Mr. Lowell, and Mrs. Fowler. Good night, boys. Was there really a prowler, that same nut in the mask? Sure, sure. You don't think I'd jump over your fence without an excuse, do you? Men have been known to. I bet. You know, I heard someone screaming, but I thought it was somebody's TV. Huh. Beside Eileen and Betty, tell me, Jackie, aren't you afraid without your loving husband home to protect you? Are you volunteering? It's convenient, and I'm right next door. Jay will be home from Alaska tomorrow. Doesn't he know we're broiling down here? Why doesn't he stay up there where it's livable? That's what I wrote him. But he wants to be home for the 4th. I guess he doesn't want to miss your party. Gareth? I'm being paged. I'll see you at the party, huh? We'll be there. Yeah, that's what I figured. Eating again? Didn't you get enough to eat at supper? And do you want to go blind? How many times have I told you about reading in good light? And will you have the courtesy to look at your mother when she's talking to you? I'm going next door. Why don't you put your trunks on and come over? It's a good chance to cool off. I thought I'd wait around for Dad. On an unscheduled flight, who knows what time he'll be here? Come on, I don't like to see you hanging around the house all the time. Okay, Ma, I will. I'll come over later. And water the plants out front. Okay, Ma, I will. Come on, Mr. Delissio. Hi. Hi, Jackie. Did Jay get home? Any minute now. Got something to show you. Well, come over here and show it. I bought it for your party, $35. Do you like it? Oh, it's beautiful, Jackie. It's keen, Mrs. Fowler. Jackie Fowler, meet Carlo Delissio. He's the new owner of the Rogers house. I've been wondering about you. Where have you been hiding? Oh, sort of commuting between my job here and my kids east. Well, I must go. Oh, swim some more if you like. Oh, please don't tempt me. I've much too much to do at the house. Mr. Delissio has a boy and girl about the same age as Craig and Eileen. When are they moving out, Mr. Delissio? Next week. Oh, that's great. Mom, is it 7:00 yet? It's after. I better get dressed for my date. Oh, but before you go, I want to talk to you about that. All right, Mother, all right. They're all the same. What about your boy? Are they all crazy like mine? No, Craig's a good boy. Nice meeting you, Mrs. Fowler. Bye. Oh, you're going the long way around. The Rogers used to use the service gate over there. Oh, thank you. Oh, I must warn you. It's going to be noisy here tomorrow night. We're having a 4th of July pool party. We have one every year. We're sort of famous for it, not notorious. Will you come, anytime after 6:00? With pleasure. Thank you very much. Widower. Scientist at a rocket engine plant. Not married, huh? But we are. You call what I got a marriage? That's what the law calls it. I'm sorry, Jackie. Strange how the two of us live side by side with our lives so different, yet so similar. Similar? Yeah, we both got married when we were kids, when we were too young to know what we were doing. Mother, the police are here. I'm Sergeant Webber from the Valley Division. Oh, yes, we talked over the phone last night. That's right. And this is Officer Lindstrom from the downtown detective bureau. He's been assigned to this case with me. He sort of specializes on this kind of thing. How do you do, ma'am? How do you do? Oh, this is Mrs. Fowler and her son Craig. How do you do? How do you do? Do you live around here? Mm-hmm. Right next door. Well, we're on stakeout tonight. If this guy comes out we'll get him. We'll get him but good. Only trouble is, everybody in L.A. wears a T-shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes. So far that's all we know. Except that he's probably a neighbor of yours. He don't mean this young fella here. He means whoever's bothering this neighborhood knows what fences to climb, when to look and what women are worth looking at. Has anybody moved into your neighborhood recently? Well, yes, right next door, some kind of a scientist. Yes, I've talked to him quite a few times. He's a very nice man. Well, we'll check him out. When we're through, we're gonna check everybody out. I'll get it, Mother. This guy is gonna celebrate Independence Day in jail. How can you be so sure? Because he wants to get caught, ma'am. Wants to get caught? That's why he attracts attention to himself. Professor Freud of the police force, he wants you to know he went to college. I think the important thing is that we're dealing with a sick person rather than a hardened criminal. Mr. Lindstrom-- Suppose we-- I mean, one of our husbands should catch him. What should we do? Call us. Officially. Unofficially... Call us before you do anything, ma'am. You were gonna say something? No, no, it's not important. Mrs. Fowler, it was your husband. He just got in the house and wants you to go right home. I'll be there in a minute. That's all right, Mrs. Fowler. I think we're through now. Listen, we're gonna be around; in case you want us, you should just yell for us. Thank you, we will. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye. Well, see you two at the party tomorrow night? Sure. And Jay, too? Okay. Come on, Craig. Mother, I'm glad Dad's home. And you? What a question. Hi, baby. Hi. Why didn't you come over and say hello to everybody? Later. I didn't want to get involved. Jay. Jay. Have some sense, Jay. Oh, yeah. Hi, son. How are you feeling? Good, Dad. And you? Did you have a smooth flight back? Nah. The brass got the transports. They jammed us civilian mechanics into a jet tanker. You know who they stuck all by himself back in the tail section. Good old Jay. Good-natured Jay. Yeah, well, at least when we put down in Canada, I bought some booze for company. Jet age, baby. Canada to California in 4 hours and a fifth of scotch. Hey, how come you're hanging around the house the night before a holiday? Why don't you go take Eileen to the movies? She's already got a date. Well, she's not the only bird in the bushes. Why don't you go call Martha? She looks like a tasty little... Here. Here's a fin. Now don't say your old man never gave you anything. It's vacation time, stay out late, live it up. Craig, you're not going out dressed like that. Go change your clothes. Did you have to come home drunk? Yes, I had to. I mean, night before a holiday, who doesn't like to get a little loaded? Oh, I-- I thought of you all the way home. All the way home. The whole month I was gone. You have any idea what it's like? A thousand miles of ice and not a single dame. Can I fix you a drink? I could use one. Great, baby, great. New suit? Marked down $15. It was made for you. I wish I could buy a dozen. I can't give you anything but love, baby. Hello. Hello? Uh... Mm... Uh... Hello? Look, you crazy nut, will you stop calling this number? Craig, you be home before midnight, do you hear? All right, Ma. Look at those crazy houses. All those picture windows. They don't let any air in. Yeah, they're just for looking through. Just as easy to look in as out. With windows like that, nobody's got any secrets. Ever since they built these glass houses, they've had one prowler case after another. Can't figure out why either. It's the heat. Everybody is all nerves, restlessness. How about your wife? Doesn't she ever wear shorts? I'm not married. Not me. Well, how about your mother then? Wasn't she ever affected by the heat? My mother was a lady. You'd never catch her prancing around with everything showing. She never had a dirty thought in her life. How long have you been on the force, Webber? Nineteen years. And you? Four. Only four years and on the detective bureau? I had some training in psychology. My first 4 years I pounded a beat... and a skull or two. The police force sure isn't what it used to be. It's not the same world either. Here comes a car. My mother wants to talk to you. What about? We haven't done anything... yet. Eileen? Hey, Craig, come here. What do you want? What are you doing tonight, Craig? Anything special? No. No. Why? Why don't you come with us? We got four chicks lined up and we need a fourth guy. Where are you going? Oh, to my girl's pad. Folks cut out for the 4th and we got the whole pad to ourselves. And what a pad, a mansion. Oh, there are gonna be fireworks tonight, huh, Craig. Huh, lover? Hey, we could give him Louise. Yeah, Craig, we saved Louise for you. Yeah, but watch out, Craig, that Louise is a tiger, a man-eating tiger. A divorcee, you know what I mean? She'll have you climbing the walls, Craig. Climbing the walls and screaming, "Mama, mama, mama, what do I do now?" I may have my flaws, but I've never been like the other fellas the company sends to these bases. They can hardly wait to tear off into town to see what they can pick up, but not me. Well, what's to pick up in an airbase in Alaska? Frostbite? Oh, they send me out to other bases, you know? Dallas, New Orleans, Kansas City, 'Frisco. You can pick up a lot more than frostbite in 'Frisco, but I'm through leaving you. That was my last trip. Last trip? The whole Air Force is changing over to missiles. The company doesn't need airplane mechanics anymore. I'm fired. As soon as the holiday is over, I'll make the rounds. Maybe Lockheed's hiring. Meanwhile, there's the unemployment check. We couldn't get along before even with overtime. What will we do now? Our creditors will wait. They always have. And if the furniture company wants to repossess this junk, they're welcome to it. Oh, it won't come to that. A good mechanic can find a job. There will always be a roof over our heads, food on the table. Where are you going? To take off this suit. Maybe if I beg, I can get my money back. Oh, you won't have to beg, baby. After the holidays I'll find a job. Yeah, and at the same lousy rate. Good old Jay. Loveable old slob. Last one to be promoted, first one that'll be laid off. Other guys always making points with the boss. Figuring the angles, knifing each other in the back, except good old Jay. Nobody's enemy, nobody's boss. No good at making money. You got any idea what it's like, Jay? Every day the same as the last. No change at all. We eat, we drink, we sleep. And like this damned heat wave, there's no relief in sight. Show me how we can fix that, somebody. Remind me to cancel the cleaning woman this Thursday. Why do the windows have to be so clean, so some peeping Tom can look in? Peeping Tom in this neighborhood? Yeah, in the last few weeks. Dirty bums. If I ever lay my hands on-- Baby, you look gorgeous in anything, everything. And you've been so good about this, not a single squawk. What are you looking over there for? Their house? Their pool? Their clothes? What? Gareth's new car. What a bomb. Oh, his. It's probably a demonstrator. It belongs to the company. Yeah, and Gareth owns the company. He fell into it. If I'd gone back to cars instead of airplanes after the war, I'd have a big company of my own. Just 'cause he's got a big, expensive, foreign car, he's no better than me. You don't think so? He's a better dancer. Chug-a-lug. Adore you, baby, adore you. Need you, baby, want you now. Be good to me, baby. The whole world's whirling, whirling, whirling. Hold me, baby. Help me. Kiss me. You've been gone a whole month riding all alone in the tail section. That's not the transportation they promised you. You should have told them to go to hell. You want to be treated like a man, act like one. In the city The streets there are dark and bare I walk alone in the in the city Doesn't anybody care? I look in any window I walk by any open door To see if someone will love me Love me forever Where did Eileen go? Are you interested? Oh, no, that's why I asked you. I get lonesome, Gareth. I was hoping you'd stay home tonight. Eileen's out on a date. Nice boy? I don't know. He's a new one. I think he's too old and too sophisticated for her. Eileen is getting pretty confused these days. Confused about what? Oh, nothing complicated, just about what's wrong and what's right. We were talking about the boy. Did you meet him? No. I asked Eileen to bring him in, but when he came, he honked his horn and she ran out, got in the car. Oh. What kind of car was he driving? I don't know. I don't judge people by their cars. Is that why you wanted me to stay home tonight so you could find somebody to criticize? As a matter of fact, I did have plans for us tonight, after working. I thought of something that might be fun. I don't think I'll even tell you what it was now. Before you go, Gareth, about the party. Have you taken care of everything? Yes, everything. Why you so worried about the party all of a sudden? Because it might be our last. We've been in this neighborhood too long. I like it here. Why not? Around here where the only real religion is keeping up with the Jones. You're Jones. And you're Mrs. Jones. I'm abdicating. They're always building new bookcases. I think it's more important to read a book. You? Miss Diving Champion of 1942, the body beautiful. Since when did you get smarter than anybody else around here? By accident. Like Columbus, we got there first. First with the two cars, the stereo, the sliding glass doors, the swimming pool. First to find out that the promised land is a fraud. There's more in life than home improvement. There's self-improvement. In that, we've got a long way to go. All right, Betty... I'll be back around midnight and you be ready to leave, huh? Leave? Yeah, yeah. That's what I was planning for tonight. I thought maybe we could jump in the Mercedes and drive out to Las Vegas, shoot little craps, get a little shut-eye, and then hit the chuck wagon for breakfast, and then va-voom, right back here in time for a real gasser of a party, huh? Racing 100 miles an hour across the desert is your idea of fun? But not for you, huh? No. Mm-hmm. You know what, Patty? You're getting old. I know. I wish I could say the same for you. Oh, knock it off, will you? This constant belittlement has got to stop. I'm free. I'm over 21. I've got a good business, and except for you I've got the respect of everybody I deal with, high-class people. High-class call girls. I know how you sell your car and who you sell them to. All right. Why do we continue this marriage? Because of Eileen. Because there's always hope for improvement. Is there? That's mostly up to you, Gareth. All right, Betty. Don't wait up for me tonight, huh? I think I will drive up to Las Vegas. And I'll see you at the party. I heard. You're going to Vegas? Where's Jay? Out cold. "Love thy neighbor," the Bible says. Yeah, I just saw a guy in the T-shirt go down the alley. Stay here. My dog. I was chasing my dog. What dog? You're out looking at broads. No. Weren't you? You want one? Are you gonna talk? Come on. Help! Help me somebody! Shut up! I was chasing my dog. Chico! Hey, Chico! Ah, he's lying. He's a liar. He saw us and ran. I got scared. Chico! Here, Chico! Here's Chico, Mr. Simons, he was in our yard. Okay, son, let's-- let's go home. There's been a little mistake. No harm done. Come on, let's all-- let's all go home. How do you know there's been a mistake? What makes you so sure he was guilty? You mean to say, he wouldn't sneak a look? Who knows? Look, all I know is that a policeman can be as guilty as anyone else of assault and battery. And if I ever catch you doing something like this again, I-- You better have names, evidence and witnesses. Good evening. Who's there? Me, your new neighbor. Oh. Hi, neighbor. It was too hard to sleep. I was too tense. Sometimes swimming at night relaxes me. Has it helped? Not tonight. Why don't we two insomniacs share some coffee? I just put out a fresh pot. You like chocolate cake? I love it. My daughter sent me one, baked it herself. It's very good. Would you like to try some? All right. Did you hear all the commotion in the next block? What was it? Oh, they were chasing some poor man. They thought it was the prowler. It's so ironic. Walk down any street, look in any window, see how many of us sit in a dark room, a television eye peeps for us into other people houses, into other people's lives. We have become a nation of peeping Toms. No longer participating in life, but getting our little pleasures from watching others. As you can see most of the furniture hasn't arrived yet. I forgot to buy some bulbs. Those are my children. You take cream and sugar? Black, please. So this is the mathematician? He looks very bright. Bobby is, in some things. Did I tell you he'll be going to college next year? Yes. MIT, wasn't it? Oh. He's not sure yet. It'll be that or Caltech. Your daughter is just like you described her, full of life. Like your Eileen. My Eileen's sort of been wild lately. Oh, it's the same with Gina. Of course, with Gina is that, a girl her age needs a mother. And father. Especially nowadays when wherever you look somebody in a bathing suit is trying to sell you something. You think the whole world would collapse if they didn't use sex to sell a product. Right. Gina's very pretty. Well, she takes after her mother. Gina misses her mother very much. She's been dead over a year now. Shall we move to the drawing room? Uh, if only a table had arrived. A table? There is one. Oh. Careful, it's heavy. It's beautiful. Especially if you like to travel. Wait. Happy 4th of July. It is the 4th now, isn't it? To Independence Day. There is a special way we lonely ones, like fireflies in the dark, send out our SOS to each other. No. Just a little. For the last few years I've had a lot of free evenings. I've taken courses in the romance languages, art, English. Sort of working my way through the catalog. Have you ever been to Italy? No. No, no, we haven't. I'd love to see Europe. I'd love to see Florence, Rome, Paris... but my husband... He's not interested. Only if he could drive there in his sports car. Oh, it's sad. The only thing that Gareth and I have in common anymore is Eileen. But once you loved him. I was young. The things that seem important then, the way a boy dressed, danced, dived off a board. Does your husband love you? For Gareth, love is a mask. He only uses it when he wants sex. How gentle you are. I never knew a kiss could be so tender. Oh, please. Please. This is Gareth's game. I don't want to play it. Mom? Mom? Dad? Dad? Dad, I got to talk to you. Dad, please. Please, somebody. Please help me. Please. Okay, back to Mamas-ville. Get out. Now when you're ready to play in the big leagues, you call me. Go to hell! Mother! Mother? Who's that? It's me Craig. Well, jump on in if you want to. Where are your folks? How about yours? Who cares? Have you been drinking? Let's kiss again and see. Craig? What's the matter with you? Are you afraid? You've always been so shy. I've always felt so... So sorry for me, huh? No, safe. I've never seen you like this before. Well, I've never been like this before. Oh, I'm out of breath. You got your breath back? Mm-hmm. Craig, I'm glad you came. Don't you think you should go home? Eileen, I can't. No! Eileen? Eileen? Eileen! It's locked. Force it! Get out of my way. Come on, everybody, back. Eileen baby. Listen, I'll phone for an ambulance, you notify the police. Okay. I'm all right, Mother, don't worry. All right. Now you know. Well, what are you gonna do about it? We're gonna find him. It could be any one of you or any one of your neighbors. Just let me get my hands on him. Me too. What's the matter with you cops, anyway? How come you let him get away? You want to come down to station and make a complaint? All right, Eileen, who was it? Oh, please, don't bother her now. You saw him, didn't you? Who was it? Was it any one of these people? Please, leave her alone. Well, we've got to have something to go on. Look, was he tall. Short? Was he wearing a mask? Yes. Craig? Good morning. Aren't you talking to your mother these days? What have you been doing? I've been reading. What have you been doing? Sleeping. Where? Just what do you mean by that? Well, I mean, is Dad still on the sofa or is he in bed? He's in bed. It's a holiday, I-- I thought maybe you'd like breakfast in bed. Will you look at me? And what's so interesting about the newspaper? Eileen? Eileen. I called the hospital this morning, they said she would be all right. She's coming home this afternoon. Her mother spent the night with her there. What's the matter? Why don't you eat? I'm not hungry. Anyway it's-- it's too hot to eat. Scratches. Who did it? Nobody did it. It was accident on the trampoline. How do you get scratches on a trampoline? Craig, where were you last night when Eileen got hurt? Where were you, Mom? Turn around. You better put some clothes on. What's everybody calling about, me? With this heat I've got a hunch they're probably more worried whether there's gonna be a party or not tonight. It's still on, isn't it? Yeah, the doctor said okay. We'll see what the police have to say. Police? Yeah, they just came in. They could hardly wait till you came home. They just want to talk to you for a minute. Daddy, I don't want to see them. Well, why not? It's something I can't talk about. I can't explain it. I just can't talk about it. But why not? The doctor said a couple of bruises and a minor concussion was all that happened to you. Why? Is there something else? What do you mean? You-- You weren't hurt anyplace else? No, Dad, just in the backyard. You've got a strange idea what's funny. What I'm laughing at, and it's not so funny, is that it's taken something like this to get you to show any interest in me. You're just like your mother. I've done everything in the world for both of you. I guess we just don't talk the same language anymore. To speak any language, Daddy, you have to start early and practice often. What shall I tell the cops? For once, Dad, do this for me. Please get them to go away. Frankly, gentlemen, I-- I think she's a little too upset to talk to you now. Maybe later, huh? How much later? Oh... why don't we wait till after the holidays are over? We'll all be feeling better then. Who knows, maybe even this heat wave will be over. Mr. Lowell, maybe you have been so absorbed in your own affairs to notice how a crime like this can get under the skin of a community. So before anybody else gets hurt, we got to stop this. We've got to have the help of everyone, including your daughter. And she may know a lot more than she lets on. Are you trying to tell me she's got something to hide? Well, if she hasn't, why don't you let us talk to her? Unless there's something wrong? What could be wrong, copper? That's enough, Mr. Lowell. Sergeant. Well, Mrs. Lowell, about the party tonight, I hope you're gonna go through with it. Help us get this neighborhood back to normal, that is, if you-- if you two feel up to it. Why not? All the preparations have been made. Maybe we need a party. Eileen, all of us. If you don't mind, my partner and I would like to come. Oh, surely. It's like an old movie where all the characters get together for the grand climax in which the great detective find out whodunit. Good. Since we were out front last night, the prowler had to climb into your yard over one of these three fences. Now the Tylers back here, didn't see anybody and they're too old to make it themselves. So we went over here to the Fowlers. We knocked on the door and there was no answer. We figure they were probably asleep. Must have had a very big night last night. Are the Fowlers coming to your party tonight? I'll make a point of re-inviting them. The third fence back here is Mr. Delissio. Will you also re-invite him? Is he a suspect too? Well, he couldn't prove where he was at the time of the attack. How can you if you live alone? Matter of fact, he did say there was somebody with him, but refused to tell who she-- who she was. Protecting the reputation of some innocent housewife? Nah, he's lying. He never had any woman there. If he didn't, he's a prime suspect then. Mr. Delissio was telling the truth. There was a woman. And how do you know? I'm sorry, Gareth, I know who it was. Who? Me. I think you both better go. See you at the party tonight. Should be very interesting. Thank you, Mrs. Lowell, for narrowing this thing down for us. I'll show you out. So pin me. You think I finally made varsity? So where is my big red A? Oh, sure, it's all a big joke to you, isn't it? Shh. Eileen. Oh. To tell the truth, Gareth, for a while I was up to bat, swinging from the heel... but I really didn't earn my scarlet letter. In fact, I settled for iced coffee. Then I heard Eileen screaming. This marriage has one last chance... if it means anything to you. Now why should it? You made a fool out of me in front of the cops, everybody. I thought so. What's crushing you is not what I did privately, but what I did to your reputation in public. It's almost funny. Oh, sure, that's right. Make an ass of me, and then laugh about it. I'm not laughing at you, Gareth. You know, I'm just liable to pay you back. I'll really show you up in public, and let's see if you can laugh then. Okay. But remember, Gareth, you're not a high school boy at a dance trying to get even with a steady by dancing with somebody else. If you intend, as you put it, to show me up tonight, it better be a good show because it will be your last. The party has to go on but this marriage doesn't. And save a little vodka for the party, lover boy. Hello. Oh, Betty. How's Eileen? Oh, good. No, we're all fine. We're just catching up on our beauty rest. Sure, we're coming. What would the 4th of July be without a pool party at the Lowells? Craig? He'll be there. And Jay, well, I can't talk for him. Betty, baby, old Jay just back from the frozen north. I wouldn't miss your party for anything in the world. Bring on the dancing girls, Betty baby, old Jay will be there. Betty, I'll talk to you tonight. Jackie, come on, please. You know, the only way you gonna get to that party is on a stretcher. Craig, answer that door. Whoever it is, send them away. How do you feel today, Craig? Pretty good. In good physical condition, nothing wrong? I'm okay. Craig, what you do when you came home last night? I went to bed. How come you left the lights on in the living room? Well, I stayed up in here for a while. Did you see anybody in the backyard? No. You hear Eileen scream? Uh-huh. What did you do? Oh, I put my bathrobe on and ran over. Why did you put robe on? Well, I had no clothes on. Why not? It was hot. It's still hot. How come you're wearing that robe? Oh, I feel a chill. Do you have any dates, Craig? How many in the past month? Three, four, two? Have you ever had relations with a girl? Uh-uh. But you like looking at girls, don't you? Who doesn't? Listen, Craig, we know now that the man who attacked Eileen would have been seen if he would have escaped into the Tylers' or the Delissios' backyard. Now he had to get away through here, do you understand? Now you can save yourself and us a lot of time and trouble. You can make things easier for everybody. Son, do you have anything to tell us? Oh, Craig, you have to go down to the drugstore. You better get dressed. Look, my husband isn't feeling very well. Could you come back later? Sure, Mrs. Fowler. Thank you very much. Say, will we see you at the pool party tonight? Yes. Will you be there? We wouldn't miss it for the world. How about you? You be there? He'll be there. Bye now. Bye. That stupid sexy broad. How I'd like to put a few questions to her. And why is she protecting that punk? Because if we showed her in black and white what kind of a son she's got, she wouldn't believe it. No wonder that poor kid's the way he is. What way is he that you can prove? You made an arrest? You got a confession? Give me 5 minutes with him. Let me get my hands on any guy that isn't normal, he'll confess. Normal? What do you mean by normal? What's normal to one man is a crime to another. You know, what disgusts a cop may delight a judge. You try to tell me what's normal and I want to know where you come from, how much money you've got and what school have you been through. Why does a kid stand outside the window instead of going in? Because it gives him a sense of power over the person inside without really having to face it. I don't believe a word of it. Come on. Let's go get a shower and get dressed and get ready for the party. Should be one hell of a brawl. Hello. So happy you were able to come. Mother-- Oh, darling, stay here and greet the people. I'll be right back. All right. Hello. How are you? Is everything okay? Do you need anything? Hi. What are you gonna have? Ginger ale's okay. Here you go. See you at the pool. Hi, Mrs. Fowler. Hi, Craig. You look wonderful, Mrs. Fowler. Well, thank you. You look beautiful, Eileen. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I've never felt better in my life. See, Craig, I told you she'd be able to dance. Have you ever seen Craig do the cha-cha? You didn't tell me you could dance. Well, sure he can. Go ahead, try it. Come on. Your yard just looks lovely, Betty. Well, thank you. Did you know we're going to have our pool in by Labor Day? Oh. I think it's going to be a little larger, don't you, dear? How is Mr. Success? Is he coming back to life yet? I'm not sure. He swallowed everything the drugstore had to offer. Now he's trying hair of the dog. Has it done him any good? Couldn't be any worse. I-- I just hope he doesn't turn ugly. Yeah, who cares about him or anybody? On with the dance. Come on, come on. We dance and be merry. You're just terrific. My mother taught me. Come on. Eileen, I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean to hurt you. It was my fault, too. It was mine. I was wild. Why did you cover up for me? Something told me that I shouldn't let them get a hold of you. I didn't want them to hurt you. Did you ever do something you couldn't help doing, like step in every square of the sidewalk? Touch every post in a fence? All the time when I was little. Did you ever have something terrible happen and everything goes blurred and rushed and you can't stop? And then all of a sudden you're doing the one thing you swore you'd never do again. Dance with me? I'm glad you're here. I'm glad to be here. So this is a pool party? Mm-hmm. Where's your husband? Over there, dancing with Mrs. Fowler He's a very good dancer. I'd introduce you, only we're not speaking. It's supposed to be funny. Jay's here. Oh, why, do you care? You haven't told Betty about us? Hi, Jay, welcome back. Hi, Betty baby. How are you feeling? Well, a little more hair of this dog and Jay Fowler rides tonight. Don't kid me, officer, I know better. If that's ginger ale, I'm Little Orphan Annie. Try some good stuff. You know me. Yeah, I know you, her husband. Party lovemaking. Yeah, but when did the party start? Start? What do you mean by that? I mean, where did he go last night? Betty baby, good to see you. Just back from the frozen north. I know, Jay. You told me all about it right here just an hour ago. Betty, where was Gareth last night? Where? He went to Las Vegas. With you? No. Not with me. Craig, don't. There are adult delinquents, too. Oh, here comes Mother. Now let's dance, come on. Craig, you promised. Craig! Craig! Now wait a minute. What are you doing? Now's our chance to get him while he's alone. Get him? We'll get a confession. Nobody will hear a thing. No, we don't have to, not now. Not the way he's upset in there. Let's just wait here and see what happens. I'm going in after him. You've been drinking. You're crazy. I can smell it on you. I'm giving him 5 minutes. Are you all right, Jay? Let's cool off. Jay! Jay! You'll kill him. Jay! Jay, you'll kill him. Jay! Jay! Jay, stop it. You go watch the drunks. I'm going in there. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Jay! He's gonna be okay. Come on. Let's get him in the house. Mother. They're sending you to the hospital as a precaution, just for overnight. Would you excuse us for a moment please? When you come back tomorrow, Gareth, we won't be here. I'm proud of the way you acted tonight. It showed me you were mature enough to understand what I have to do. I know. I should have done it years ago. But I've always used you as an excuse. Goodbye, Gareth. I hope you'll be happy. As long as you got money, who needs happiness? I couldn't stop. Once I got started, I couldn't stop. Let's get him! Oh, my God. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on out! Hey! Hey! They're in the back. In the back. In the back. Hey, they're in the back. Jay! Jay! It's Craig. It's Craig. Jay, it's Craig! Craig? What's the matter with you? What are you doing? Jay, come on. Oh, my God. Let me go! Let me go! Oh, my God. Craig. Craig? It's your boy? Mom, make him stop. He's getting hurt awful bad. For you, Craig. Remember that, for you. No. For both of us. Break it up! I'm taking this man in for assaulting an officer. Get these people out of here. Listen, if you people got any complaints, give this officer your names and your addresses. I'll see to it that the lieutenant gets in touch with you in the morning. All right, Webber, why don't you wait for me down at the station? Craig, you're gonna have to spend the night down at Juvenile Hall. Juvenile Hall? Your parents will be able to visit you there in the morning. What did he do? Climb the roof? Look in a few windows? He's a kid. He's never been in trouble before. What are you gonna do to him? There'll be a hearing in the morning, ma'am. The judge will see to it that he gets some help. Now that's what he needs is help. We'll do it. Will you give him the kind of home life he needs? That's what the judge is gonna want to know. He'll also arrange for some psychiatric care. Now that will help. He'll also want a report from the police, me. I've just been talking to the Lowells. Now the girl admitted that the accident last night was mostly her fault. As far as Mr. Lowell is concerned he'd just as soon forget the whole thing. Come on, Craig, I'll drive you down to the Hall. Will you both come down tomorrow? We'll be there, son. We'll be there. Ma, it wasn't me who looked in all those windows. What do you mean, Craig? It was a guy with a mask. He wasn't scared of people, they were scared of him. He was big and strong. He could jump over roofs and climb fences and look in windows and see whether everybody lived the same way our family lived. Craig. I had no idea about Craig. I did. There's been reason enough. We'll make it up to him. I hope we can, Jay. I hope we can.
