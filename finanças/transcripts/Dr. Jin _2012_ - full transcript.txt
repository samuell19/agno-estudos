Episode 8 Did you just arrive? Yes. Please rest. I have something to tell you. Ah...yes. Could you move out as soon as possible? Our Young Rae is going to get married to Major Kim soon. Mother. Doctor Jin will have to know anyway. If there is a strange man staying at a woman's house who is soon to be married, people will look at it weirdly, And then, I do not want her to get blamed for non-existing flaw when there is an upcomming celebration. In order to repay you, even making a pair of shoes out of my own hair wouldn't be enough, but why else would I make this request? I hope you understand. Yes. I understand. Thank you. Please rest. Why aren't you proposing? Why you talking about that right now? So awkward... I could run away, you know. What are you talking about? You want to postpone the wedding? I'm not saying I won't do it, it's just so sudden. I want to slow down and take time to think. Stop saying such absurd things! If you postpone a marriage that even the Left Prime Minister has agreed to, then what would we look like? So you're forcing this marriage to avoid looking bad? Hey, Young Rae. If not, is it because it's more important to become in-laws of a powerful family? I don't really know. If I get married with these feelings... I feel like I'll be sinning against Major Kim, and I'm afraid of that, Mother. You're turning me... into a mother who sells off her own children. That's not it. It is called a married woman... A marriage is an event which transforms a child that a woman delivered into someone else's child. What is the dignity of that household?... Will my daughter receive love from her husband?... Wanting to examine just one more thing. Worrying about all these little details... That is a mother's greed. What else would I hope for? Just Young Hwi to succeed in life and... I want to see you marry into a proper family, and receive a lot of love from your husband before I die. Then I would be able to face your dead father. Do you really not know your mother's feelings? Mother! I've given you a lot of trouble. How disappointing. You have to leave right when we just became attached to you. You don't have to rush it like this. I feel as though I have laid down an order. No you're not. There's a lot to do at the clinic, and this is a great chance to move over there. Then.. goodbye and stay well. Doctor Jin! I haven't seen you at the clinic recently so I was wondering what happened. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have made you feel uncomfortable. Then... Last time.. What you said to me... what did you mean? The story about the "other world". It's nothing. Please don't worry about it. There... Congratulations on your marriage. What? Marriage? So did you get kicked out? That's not it, I just thought I had troubled them too much. So you did get kicked out. For now, I'll just stay here. Just until I find a place to stay. Who's got all the time in the world? Urgency? I am more in a hurry than anyone here! It is not just anybody. Lord Kim Pa Sun's youngest daughter is ill. Huh, huh. Merely ill with that. I have money. Money! Wait a moment. We are making medicine zealously, but there isn't enough to give to all the people here. -Oh my goodness... -What to do? And we won't give it to you just because you argue like this. So I've decided. The new medicine will be given to those who have severe inflammation first. No! No! Give it to me first! Me! Be quiet. The clinic's doctors will judge the symptoms. Noble or commoner will not be differentiated. No matter how much money you give, only those based on urgency of the patient's symptoms will be prescribed. Do you understand? Miss, Major Kim has arrived. Coming out here puts me in a good mood. Also since I'm with you. Why is your expression so gloomy? Why? The wedding is so sudden that you are unwilling? Um..My Lord. Come here. I have a place I need to show you. Do you know where this is? During my younger years, when my nose was drooping with boogers, I was defeated by Young Hwi. With a furious heart, I started training with the sword secretly. Rain or snow. Not even skipping one day. Every time after the training has finished, I committed to inscribed some words little by little. Young Rae I was planning to wait forever. For you to come to me. Please come to me. What did you just say? I asked you to become one of my people. You and all of the people you lead. That is... Is that the best that a man who searched for meditation and balance for self-discipline can become... ...the head of gang of thieves? If there is a butcher, he only gets to decide which cow his sword will slaughter. If a warrior swings a sword, it becomes a sword that slashes the enemy. I'm saying this because you seem very useful. Then... by utilizing me who are you trying to slay? It is this nation, Joseon. Not a nation of Lee but Ahn-Dong Kim family's Joseon. The old rotten tree which is sucking the blood from the good people in Joseon. I'll slash even it's root. Won't you... become my sword? What secret conversation are you having for so long? The questions are short but the answers are very long. Well, to a mere scholar without any official position, you're talking an useless joke, that's why. Oh, right! I heard you will become in-laws with the Left Prime Minister. It must be very strange. Ah..um..today I'm getting drunk so fast. I will leave now. Be careful on your way back. Thanks to you, I've had a nice drink. Please rest. When you wake up your neck will be much lighter. I'm begging you. I'll do my best. Then...the anesthetic please. Ah, the s-s-soju, s-soju anesthetic. Wait, look here! Get out of the way. Hey, Officer Lee!! What are you doing? Get up at once! My Lord. What are you doing here at this hour? Ah..but this man is.. These bastards. You dare to put a knife on a nobleman's wife? Looks like you want to die. It's not a very difficult surgery. Shut your mouth! Is there someone out there? Bring these men out at once! Yes. My Lord. My Lord. My Lord, you can't do this. My Lord! I didn't touch the knife! I just followed him! I'll talk to you later. I'm going to have to turn those doctors into retards. I asked them to do it! I... although I knew it was against the dignity of noble families, I thought nothing would matter as long as I could remove this ugly thing. So I secretly called a doctor. Are you in your right mind? How can you as a woman let some strange man put a knife up to you? If rumors start, then what will you do? Rumors and knives don't scare me. The only thing I am scared of... is you, My Lord. What? Ever since I've gotten this tumor, you've ignored me. You spend nights out in the palace even on days you were not required to work. With excuses of going to a writing club or meeting friends, You didn't come home. Wife, that's because... Do you know the feeling of a woman who is disregarded by her husband? The feeling that my whole body feels like... it has turned into a tumor. That truely dreadful feeling... Do you know? Oh my goodness..we're dead. We're dead. Look here! Do you know who that person is? He is the Queen dowager's... immediate nephew-in-law! Nephew-in-law! Queen dowager...? Ahh, she is the eldest person in the palace! Even the Ahn-Dong Kim family cannot act carelessly! We have brought on the anger of that eldest person's nephew-in-law. We are now dead. Ah, My Lord! Do something, anything! This won't do. Wait a moment. Can you... remove the tumor cleanly? Yes. Her life won't be jeopardize? Yes, that is correct. You don't have to say more. He even saved Left Prime Minister's life who was at the hell's door. How is the pulse? There is nothing wrong. Oh my... I have squeezed an infected sore that was a size of a chestnut. But... It's my first time with something this big. Don't get nervous. Just give me what I ask for. Since she's.. Queen dowager's nephew's daughter, my hand is trembling. If Miss Young Rae were here, it would be very good. Then I will begin. Here. It's the feeding vessel. Clamp it to keep it from bleeding then other area is extracted.. Tumor's outlining boarder is clear. Fortunately, it hasn't spread to other areas. Oh my goodness..this is really... Let's stay focused. Under the ear, the superficial portion is also extracted. Oh my goodness... Merely squeezing the infected sores is hard to do -You're amazing. -Stay focused. What? Oh, alright. How did it go? It ended well. What did I tell you? You can trust Doctor Jin. You are admirable, Doctor Jin. Admirable. You've gone through a lot of trouble too, Doctor Huh. Of course, I've gone through a lot. Doing what you told me to do. You should've told him earlier. His wife didn't want him to know. But if something went wrong, we would've His wife didn't want him to know. But if something went wrong, we would've become like this. Anyway, it turned out well. She is someone Queen dowager adores. If she finds out, she'll be very happy. When she recovers,... there is a possibility that Queen dowager will call for you. Who is Queen dowager? She's the palace's highest adult! If you can get her trust, you will gain a big power. My Lord. Is that why you introduced me? I don't care about- Don't you have any better quality than this one? Of course, I have. I have red satin silk and white satin silk imported from China. Mother, in our budget, how come..? Don't worry. Major Kim said to take care of you. Oh my...so pretty. It's beautiful, isn't it? She's going to get married, right? Forget her. A match of lovers is given by Heaven. How about it? This time I'll be the doctor. Will you recieve my prescription? So... people are lining up in front of the door to get that new medicine? Even if it didn't work, for you to give me the information about the gisaeng before, I thank you for that. From now on, you're going to have to be my eyes and ears. By the way, the house of Officer Lee... What is Prince Heung Seon thinking? Are you trying to look good in the eyes of your future brother-in-law? Why? Is my hospitality today not satisfactory for you? If my brother-in-law visits the gisaeng house often, how can I be assured? Now that I think about it, you're right. I didn't think that through. Here, drink up. Look here, Kyung Tak. I have a request for you. Once Young Rae marries to you, you will be the only one she can trust and rely on. If our house... No, if something were to happen to me, please protect my Young Rae until the end. Ah, this friend must be drunk already! Can you... promise me that you'll do that? If I can die to save my fiancee, I will gladly die. By any chance, if she has to die in order for me to live, I'll die then too. Thank you. For what fun are two men drinking without a gisaeng? By the way, I heard the news of the wedding. Congratulations. Thank you. I'll pour you a glass. Older sister. Prince Heung Seon and Doctor Jin are here. Please give me a moment. This turned out well. Escort them here. Tomorrow, before lunch, they will send Sajoodanja. [a kind of letter to confirm the marriage] Why, My Lady? We must serve some meal to the servants bringing the letter. Since they are the servants of the powerful family, I'm afraid if they won't like our food. Finally you are getting married. How happy would your father be if he saw this? What are you thinking about? What? Ah...it's nothing. Have as much as you'd like. Today, I am buying. See? My nose is the Dog's nose to find free drink! Becoming in-laws with Left State Minister? How honored it would be? Since my best friend becomes my brother-in-law, that's what I'm happy for. Have a glass, My Lord. No, I'll pour him one. Accept it. I'm alright. I don't plan to drink. Why? Do you not like the congratulatory meeting for my marriage? Does it matter whether I like it or not? Is there a reason for him to dislike it? He's just exhausted because he's taken care of patients all day. Oh, right. I heard you moved to the clinic. All because of Mother... There are many patients at the clinic. And we need to continue making medicine. Your mother isn't wrong, either. Frankly speaking, a man living in my fiancee's house, I wasn't that comfortable with it either. You shouldn't talk like that. Doctor Jin is like a life savior to you, too. That's why I let him be. But now, isn't it different? It's a place with the woman who will soon become mine. I will leave first. I'm very curious about you. I have no idea what you're thinking. Behind that amazing and mesmerizing medical skill, Well, well. Our Major Kim is going to interrogate people in a gisaeng house now. Well, since this wench committed so many crimes, I'd rather prepare myself to get flogged! Am I the only curious one? Suddenly appearing like a goblin, possessing amazing medical skills. I want to know his identity. I will also ask a question. Can you make the Miss happy? What? Please...make her happy. That impudent man. You must keep your distance. If you stay near her, she will be in great danger. What do you mean? She is not the person you think she is. What do you mean? I said what do you mean? Older sister! Somebody is looking for Doctor Jin. He said he's from Lee Gyu Rhi's house. Why are you coming out from that room? You... Young Rae. Do you like Dr. Jin-- Ever since I first saw him, he strangely attracted me. I kept thinking of him, and when I was with him, my heart fluttered. I don't know why I'm acting like this either. You can't, Young Rae. I know. That's why. He left his clothes. I don't want any of his things left behind. Whether it's lingering feelings or regrets. Here, here. Hurry. Why is she behaving like this? The wound is getting infected. It is getting inflamed. Wife. Come to your senses. Don't worry. For now, let her breathe deeply and calm down. On the site of surgery, use a towel soaked in cold water for cold pack. Will that help? Once we use antibiotic, it will be reduced. Wife. Wife. Come to your senses. Is there no one there? Is there no one home? F-fire! Medicine. The medicine is in there! No! What's happening? Miss! Miss! Miss! Please get up. Over here. Miss. Bear it for just a moment. Miss! Oh my gosh! How about Doctor Huh? Is he not here? He should be here!!! How did this happen? Give me some cold water. And a clean cloth. I understand. Miss. Just bear it for a little while. Just a little while. Where are you coming from? W-what happened? What are you doing? Hurry up! Oh, I got it. Miss. It's a second-degree burn. Thankfully it didn't kill any nerves. However, because of that, the pain is more agonizing. Oh my goodness, miss. What do we do when you're so unfortunate? What should we do? Cold water! Please put cold water on it quickly! Hurry. I should cool down the the surface temperature of the wound first. Keep going. What happened here? Yes, there was a fire that suddenly started. Find if there is still any fire left, and also check where it started. Yes, let's go. Yes! Where is Doctor Jin? Pardon? Ah, ah yes. Th-th-that, I- Is it bad? You've got blisters. I have to treat it, but it might be hard to bear. It's alright. It will also hurt a lot when I disinfect it. I'll try to endure it. What were you doing that this would happen to you at such a late hour? You had left your clothes, so I brought them. I could have gotten them later. And if there's a fire you should escape first. What were you going to do? Where is the medicine? Medicine? I was bringing the medicine. You didn't see where I lost it at? Then..because of the medicine? Sir. Miss. It's all right. Did you get hurt a lot? No, it's alright. Look here. Escort her immediately. Wait. I have to treat the burn here right now. I also have to disinfect it. Shut your mouth. Who do you think caused this to happen to her? Sir, that's not it. It's fine if you blame me, but Right now, she needs to be treated. If you are worried about her, then please let me do so. Listen well. If she gets any worse, you won't be safe either. I'll need to get more cloth. You're a really strange person. Are you aware of it? You never let me relax. I'm sorry. I'll drop by often. Excuse me, sir. Before the clinic caught on fire, I saw someone running away. A burn?! Mother. Calm down. Stay here. I'll go. Ho Sa Da Ma! [If many good things happened, bad things follow] How come can this bad thing happen before her marriage!? Let go. I need to go. Mother. Look here. Look here! W-what... What happened? Can't you see for yourself? Everything burned down. The medicine? It all became a pile of ash. The medicine, the ingredients, the tools...everything. Even if we start over, we won't be ready within 1-2 days How about Doctor Jin? Is Doctor Jin safe? He's alright, but the young lady got hurt. Who got hurt? Doctor Jin. What a horrible accident it is! How did the lady.. But still, it's good that it's only this bad. Think of it that way. Yes. Anyway, what will you do without the medicine? The status of Lee Gyo Ri's wife is not good. Is her inflammation getting worse? Her body temperature is high, and it seems her vitality is getting lower. He's so angry asking when the doctor is coming with medicine! If something goes wrong in any case, what should we do for its consequence!? There is one more... medicine left. Really? We're set. The heavens helped us! The heavens! Now then, let's- The young lady got burned in the fire to save this medicine. She's doing alright now, however if she were to take a turn for the worst... Then her life could be in danger. That won't do. Keep this and use it on the young lady. But if something happens to that lady, then you will be in trouble. Don't worry about me. It's the medicine the lady risked her life to save. It's right to use it on her. It's not just anyone, It's Young Rae. How are you feeling? Do you have a fever? I'm fine. Just, the burned part is sore, but I can endure it. While making this medicine, I have a rule I decided on. Disregarding status, or wealth, use it on the patient who needs it the most. And in that decision, no personal feelings can play a part. That's why I have to ask your understanding. Although it is medicine you saved in the fire, there is a patient who needs this medicine immediately. I'll have to... I'll have to use this medicine on that person first. It is right decision. If you hadn't done so, I would have been disappointed in you, Doctor Jin. I'm alright, so go and save that person. Hurry. Thank you. Rub here. You've suffered a lot. With this medicine, will she be ok? It's just a temporary inflammation, so it will be soon reduced. Ah, I heard a fire broke out at the clinic, but isn't there any loss on your medicine? Well... this is the last remaining medicine. Then..what if she needs it again? What then? If you disinfect the site well and she takes a full rest, she will be fine. And I will make the medicine as fast as possible. If her treatment is well completed, I won't forget the help of you and Prince Heung Seon. Doctor Jin. Even though my thanks is not enough, truely, thank you so much. Then..I'll leave now. I am sorry, Doctor Jin. Because of me, the medicine that you needed to use for the young lady was... As a doctor, I did as I was supposed to do, and the young lady also wanted this way. To live just as an ordinary girl... her skills and her wantings are not fitted. I have to go off first. I have to see how the lady is doing. That's right. Go first. What's wrong? Tha lady's mother took the lady away. What did you say? By Prince Heung Seon's leadings, Dr. Jin has treated Officer Lee's wife's tumor. She had a lump? I've never heard of that... Is that something to brag about or something? They probably just kept it as a secret. If it's Officer Lee's wife.... Isn't that the Queen Regent's Niece?!?!? It wouldn't be just a niece... It's the niece that the Queen Regent has adored since she was a child... How Officer Lee got his government position was thanks to the Queen's help. But, why was Prince Heung Seon over there? He probably wants to make a connection with the Queen Regent. What? So such a person like a dog of mourn house? Silence. If Prince Heung Seon visits the pavillion of the Queen Regent, keep watching it. Yes, I understand, My Lord. Mysterious medical skill or something like that, he would try to use Doctor Jin to mesmerize the Queen Regent. As for that, you should look at that. I shall do as you commanded. Then, what should I do, Father? You... just don't create any more trouble! What? There was a medicine that didn't burn so he used that?! So annoying... Dr. Jin is getting very annoying. What are you doing here? Won't you leave? Miss is a patient right now! And we need to treat her! We'll do it ourselves so just leave! We'll do it ourselves so just leave! Please don't appear in front of our child. Please! Madam, miss is... Young Rae. Young Rae! Come to your senses! - Miss. - Young Rae. Miss. Young Rae, come to your senses! Come to your senses! Hey. Young Rae. MIss. Why is she acting like this? Why is our child behaving like this? Please take her outer clothes off. Just now..what did you say? We must lower the fever, quick. Or she could lose consciousness! Hurry! This is bad. Her burn is starting to become infected. Please go to the clinic immediately. Hurry! Yes. We have found things that were left in the fire. Also many parts of the place smell like oil. It seems like someone intentionally set on the fire. Setting a clinic on fire is defying the law. This is definetly something that the suspect should be punished! So, until we catch the culprit, you should cooperate with our interrogation. Last night, who took the night stand? Doctor Huh. Where is he right now? Well, that is..I haven't seen him since a while ago. Is there anyone who has heard or seen his whereabouts? So, a thief who feels guilty ran away for himself. Go locate him right now! And make sure he doesn't get out of the city! Yes. What are you doing here? What happened here? Did you bring it? Yes. Here. Yes. Here. I asked you what happened. Earlier she was just fine! Her wound got infected. So she has a fever and has lost conciousness. Then don't you need to use some medicine for that?! I heard there's medicine that she brought out from the fire. What did you just say? You used the remaining medicine on someone else? Then what happens to her? The only thing we can do is treating her wound and putting her fever down. So you're hoping some luck without medicine? Is that something that should come out of a doctors mouth?!?! How can you use the medicine she risked her life to bring on a diifferent person? That... I warned you. That if my lady is in danger, so would you. Since your the greatest doctor, you probably have your own ways as well. Weather you have medicine or not, Save the lady. If you can't... you will die. Even if you have to look everywhere you need, you HAVE to find the arsonist, Doctor Huh! Understand? Yes! Boss, will you really open the gamble place in a gisaeng house? I really couldn't believe Sir Heung Sun... Hey, rascal. Once we make a place, he said he would bring the customers, so what are you worrying about? It's to kill two birds with one stone. To rip off the noble men will be quite fun. Wait. You guys... If I catch you guys messing around with gisaengs, I'll kill you that day. What are you talking about? Nonsense. Hey, this kid already did it. You already did it didn't you?! What would did I do?!? Oh, give me that back! Aigoo, give it back to me! Aren't they the gang of the herb merchants? Ah, right! Aigoo, they're beating him up so much! Give me back! I brought the money back! Hyungnim. It's that guy from the clinic. Who who? The guy that's getting beat up? Hey, lets just go. It's going to be a pain in the butt getting involved. Ah, they're really making me mad. I guess we have to do some work now. Hey you idiots!!! The fever isn't going down. The infection is getting worse! Penicillin. If only I had Penicillin. Dr. Jin. Please don't go. Come back. Please. Dr. Jin! Dr. Jin! Oh, Dr. Jin. Doctor Huh. What happened? How did you get so.. Medicine. I brought back the medicine. Penicillin. I brought the Penicillin. Are you saying you brought some medicine? Really? Where..? He had sold it to a pharmacist and he got it back. And it seems like he got it back! He was getting beat up! What-- Even if I had 10 mouths, I wouldn't be able to say anything. My eyes were blinded by the money. Setting the fire and coming to see the lady... I'm sorry! Take him in! - Yes! - Yes! Hold on. Hold on. Doctor Huh has saved the young lady. Now we can save her. Thanks for saving her. I just did what I had to do. No. I almost lost my most important person. Okay. I acknowledge you as a doctor. Now, as the young lady is recovering, I will hurry the marriage and she will become my wife. So that nothing like this will ever happen again. Don't ever appear in front of the young lady again. Even if you've saved my important people a few times, in other words, it means wherever you go, there are bad luck and accident. If you really care for the young lady, disappear from her sight forever. You asked if I could make her happy. Don't worry. I'll definitely make sure she is. Hey is there any one out there? Alcohol... Bring me some alcohol! Alcohol is also one of food. If you have it when you feel angry, you will get an upset stomach. What's wrong with my feeling? Since the Left State Minister doesn't think his eldest son is reliable, how can you feel comfortable about it? Did you come here to embarrass me? That's impossible. I came here to help you, Sir. If you want to get his trust, you need to build some credits. Now, to His Excellency, what do you think would give some concern? Has he ever showed me what he thinks? You also heard it with me at the same place, but didn't you get it? What? If Prince Heung Seon becomes closer to the Queen Regent by him being a relative of the King, then, not only His Excellency, but also Andong Kim's family will have a big burden. What His Excellency worries about.. is exactly this point. What could I do even if I knew that fact? When a knot is twisted too tightly, rather than untying it, just cutting it is better. You're telling me to kill a relative of the king? Only a relative of the King? Also the doctor or something who uses a mere trick needs to be removed. Please don't show up in front of my child again! Please! If you really care for the young lady, disappear from her sight forever. If you stay near her, she will fall into great danger. The young lady is not the person you think she is. Again... We will... probably be able to... meet once again. Be well. That's right. This wasn't my place from the beginning. I have to go back to the place where Mi Na is. But... Where should I go? Young Rae. Have you come back to your senses now? Huh? Where is Doctor Jin? Why are you looking for him? He is not here. What? He left! He left? Wait, why are you getting up? Miss! Somebody came to look for Doctor Jin. Finally, the Queen Regent! I will have an audience with Her Highness! That's right, Dr. Jin! I should let Dr. Jin know about this first! Who are you guys? How dare you... Do you know who I am? Won't you get out of the way?! No way. You didn't get hurt, right? How did you know...? Miss! What were you trying to do when you saved me? Did you not say we should change the present Joseon? I was curious about what your kind of Joseon would be like So you're saying that you knew someone was trying to kill me? The one who told them to kill you is Kim Dae Kyun. Kim Dae Kyun? But, how did you know that? You'll come to know that in time. Kim Dae Kyun, that bastard! He probably feels uneasy Since you've been granted an audience with the queen mother. The matter has become urgent I must hurry to see the queen mother Wait, Miss. What happened? I heard that you were in danger. So... So you came here with your body in that condition? Are you crazy? I was so worried that something might happen to you that I didn't think about anything else. For being alive, I really thank you. Please go back home. I have to leave now. Where in the world are you saying you're going? Are you possibly... planning on leaving forever? You can't. Don't go. Didn't you say that you have nowhere to go? Didn't you say that you lost your memory? But, where are you going to go? I'm a person who can't be here! What in the world are you saying? Doctor Jin! I... came from a different world. From a very distant future. Your Highness, Prince Ha Eung, is here. Your Highness! I, Lee Ha Eung, am presented to wish Your Highness' well-being. I was planning to wait forever. For you to come to me. Come to me. What are you doing My Lady? My Lord ! Ah this man is.... Is there anyone out there? Take them out immediately. Aigoo... Sir... Do something.... This won't do, wait a moment. No.... What happened here? The medicine? If you can't save her you are going to die. I have to go back.
