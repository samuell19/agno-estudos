I won't be long, I'm just going to check on my daughter. Excuse me. Excuse me, everyone. Sorry... Has anyone seen Olivia? Claire, what's going on? I think you'd better call the police. So after everything that's happened, are there any new suspects? There's a few, yes. A search of the local area has taken place. As of now, nothing's been found. We're urging anyone with any information to please come forward. Thank you. It's been two weeks since the disappearance of Olivia Truman. Olivia went missing from her home in Greater London during a family birthday party. The nanny put Olivia to bed and when I checked later that night... She was gone. There was a large gathering that night. Police interviewed everyone at the party. And nobody saw a thing? Nothing. She just vanished. From her bed? From her bed, yes. Right under our noses. I need as much info as you got on a Roma Bernard. Roma. As in Romeo, Oscar, Mike, Alpha. That's it. And Bernard, err, Bravo, Echo, Romeo, November, Alpha, Romeo and, yeah, D for dickhead. That's it. Everything you've got on him. I'm speaking to the parents first thing in the morning so I need everything by then. Can you do it? You legend. Cheers buddy. All right, I'll speak to you soon. You coming to bed or you sleeping on the sofa like every night? Yeah, I'll be up in a minute. You can take a break you know. Your daughter misses you. You hear me? What do you want me to do? Can you see what's going on? Have you seen this case? I crack this one... That's chief inspector. It's nice to see what's important to you. Good. I'll be up in a minute. Don't bother. Oh, fuck. I don't trust the parents. Why not? I dunno, there's something not quite right about them. What would you do if Lucy went missing? I don't know what I would do if they took my son. I do feel for the Trumans. Yeah? Well my nose never lies. And that's why I'll make DCI and you won't. Really? We'll just see about that. You have a lovely home. Yeah. How are you coping? Staying positive. Thank you. Have you any new info? What? What is it? We need to speak to your nanny again. Mariam? She's gone back to Romania. Yeah, we heard that. It's unfortunate considering we told everyone not to leave the country. Well, she missed her daughter, as I'm sure you understand. Why would I understand? We've heard about you. Good things. We need to contact Mariam. Why? What have you found? We can't discuss that. Don't give me that! Don't. I'm sorry- - Just tell us something, please. Anything. Some things have come to light which involves your sister too. Liz? What has she got to do with this? Have you seen her recently? No. Why? You haven't spoken to your sister since the night your daughter disappeared? No. Have you spoken to her boyfriend Rob? Yeah. Yeah, we've spoken to him. I thought I should call you guys because, um, well, on reflection, there are a couple of things that happened that night that even I can't make sense of. And you're just telling us this now? Well I didn't think anything of it at the time, did I. But now... What? Liz is missing. I don't know where she is. She's not answering her calls. Liz relapsed at the party. She's an addict? Yeah. Well, she was. Erm... She'd been clean for three or four months now. Then something happened that night. I don't know what. It all started when she spoke to that fucking nanny. God, I'm bored. Let's fuck. I think people might see us. On Claires bed? No, absolutely not! Rob, come on. Don't be so square. Hey, I am not square. I'm actually very well rounded. You're lucky you're funny. Or what? You wouldn't date my ugly arse? I like your ugly arse. Like. I see. 'Cause I love yours. What the fuck is she looking at? Who? The nanny. She keeps staring at me. Maybe she fancies you. Probably. This is so weird. She's waving me over. Go tell her we don't mingle with the help. Okay, I better go and see what she wants. Do you want me to come with you? No. Fine, I'll just mingle with myself. They went outside for a chat, a cigarette, I don't know. And, um, when she came back, she... it was like a light had switched. She started spiralling. Hey, hey, hey, slow down. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it. Come on, Liz, caring is sharing, remember. Fuck off, Rob. I'm worried about her. Liz has been known to hang out with some pretty dark, shady people. What kind of shady people? Dealers, addicts, loan sharks, you name it. Fuck sake! Damon! I knew it, they want Liz, she owes them money or something. I'll call her. Yeah, call her. Call her now and tell her to get over here! Did you speak to her that night? Briefly. Liz, call me when you get this. It's urgent. I'm worried about you. Call me back. It's Claire. What did she say to you that night? Hey big sis, how's tricks? You okay? Mhmm, I'm great. I am fucking hunky-dory. I'm Elizabeth. Roma. Homer. Ro-ma. Roma, oh. Ha, ha, ha, you're French. Oui. Oui. And this must be your dad? He's my lawyer. Oh. I need me one of those. Pfft, why is everyone so fucking serious? This is supposed to be a party! Loosen up! She absolutely humiliated me in front of Andre. Remind me who Andre is. He's a French ambassador. We were lucky to have him in our home. How did you meet Damon? At a Pharma conference in Paris. Oh, so you're into pharmaceuticals then? Sometimes. Yeah. Me too. Excuse me. It's the wife. Judge Judy's just finished, she'll probably be bored. So. Do you mind? Tell me more about Roma. I'm sorry, why do you want to know about Roma? 'Cause Liz stole his phone. I'm sorry what? She stole his phone. Hi, I, uh, sorry to interrupt. Liz, can I have a minute? Robert, can't you see I'm in the middle of a conversation? Yes, I noticed. Roma. Hi, I'm Robert, Liz's long term boyfriend. Ugh. What's with all the labels, eh? Do you mind if I steal her for a second? Please. Thank you. Liz, a quick word. I'll be right back. I won't keep her for long. What do you want? What is this? What's what? What's happening? Even for you, this isn't normal. Then get with the fucking program. Ooh! Rob. I'm never gonna be who you want me to be. You are who I want. You don't know me. I know enough. You don't know my past. Your past is what makes you who you are, the person that I love. Robert. You're a nice guy. And you think people are good inside but they're all fucking rotten. I'm rotten. Hey, hey, no, no, no, you are not rotten. Look, fuck off, Rob. Liz, open up. Liz! You need a leash, no? It's not what it looks like. Then what the hell is it? Hm? Shh! It's a honey trap. Liz, what the fuck is going on? He is a very bad man. Fuck sake! Fucking phone's locked! What's on his phone that's so important anyway? Mariam? Mariam? Keep it down, Olivia's sleeping. Why do you want Mariam anyway? What you doing? Where the fuck is Mariam? Why did Mariam go out that night? Didn't she already tell you this? Mhm. We'd like to hear your version. Something about a boyfriend. Why what did she tell you? Just that she went to the cinema. Alone. Well, why would she lie? An even stranger question would be why would she ask Liz to steal Roma's phone and then leave? Do you have a way we can contact her? I've dealt with Romanians in Vice before, they're absolute scum. Bit fucking racist, innit? Racist? You have no idea what these people are capable of. All right, 'cause I was born yesterday. Danny, they're major human traffickers. He's a weird cunt, ain't he. That's the victims father. Exactly. Careful, Danny. We have her online. Okay, so run us through everything that happened that night. I told you everything. Well tell us again. I don't have much time. Well, make time. Or we'll have your Romanian police ship you over here so fast, you won't even have time to take the Goulash off the stove. Why must you speak to me like this? Probably because you hopped on a flight out during a major investigation. I had to see my daughter. Yeah, lucky you. I put Olivia to bed. Do your parents let you use that? They don't care. I care, delete please. Now. Time for bed, Mariam. Darling, how do I look? Good. Very good. You sure? You look perfect. Ready? I loved her like my own daughter. Loved? Love. Yes. No, you said 'loved', past tense. My English is not so good. Yeah, it sounds pretty good to me. But please, continue. What is it? I had an accident. I should inform your mother. She's busy with her friends. She doesn't care anyway. I don't think that's true. We need lady pads. You know? Maybe check her bathroom. I changed her bed sheets. I gave her the tampons and she went to bed. And I didn't see her again. Because you went out? Yes. To the cinema? Yes. What did you see? Nothing. Nothing, good film that. I think I might have seen it. I had something to eat instead. A nice slap-up meal with the boyfriend? What's his name then? I don't have a boyfriend. Hm, no labels? Well it is 2020 after all. What? Claire said... that you went out to see your boyfriend. What? No. No, I was alone. So she's lying? Yes. This is getting fucking interesting. Wait. You think I did this? Of course, blame the poor Romanian, we are all peasants who you cannot trust. Sorry, the race card isn't gonna work with us, Mariam. Well, this country did vote for fucking Brexit, didn't it. You know nothing. I was trying to help Olivia. Mama. Who's that? My daughter. Can we see her? No. You really want to know what happened? We really, really do. You think you do, but do you really? What is this a trick question? Yes, we really do want to know. And you swear you will protect my family? We pinky promise. Assholes. Okay, here is the truth. Well, we're strapped in. Where's Olivia? Ask her fucking parents. This is a nice house Mr. Truman. Thank you. Could be better. Okay, let's discuss. We've considered a price. Good. Twenty thousand per meeting. No, no, no, this is too much. Really? I think we all know it's not. For me, Olivia is nothing special. Well, if that was the case, you wouldn't have travelled all this way. She's good isn't she? We just want a good deal. Fifteen is a good deal. Seventeen. Seventeen and we'll prep and drug her. She won't remember a thing. That's a funny story. Of course, who would believe an immigrant woman over a respectable British family? I do. I do! But then again I love a conspiracy theory. You know, like, 9/11 was an inside job. You mock me, but there is evidence. I know, like the steel beams and the thermite, I've seen all the documentaries. I know all about it. No. Roma's phone, idiot. Seventeen. Agreed. Now, this phone has recorded everything we just said. So if we go down, you go down. C'est compris? People don't understand this kind of thing. We have to be careful. I do. My sister and I were given this kind of love from our own father. We were always careful. Champagne? You see this? This is my shocked face. And this is my 'I call bullshit' face. I knew no one would believe me, so I needed evidence. You think this is funny? Mary - what's your name? Mariana, you call me Mariam. Mariana, Mariam, whatever. In this country, we don't sell our children. Where are you from? Romania. Romania. Do they sell children in Romania? Probably. On eBay, right? They do everywhere. Now, why are you telling me, of all people? Because you know what it's like. And how would I know what it's like? You were abused by your father. I heard Damon tell it to the men. Yeah, they recorded everything on their phone. Just fucking be quiet for a second. Okay, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who are you? What? I said who the fuck are you? I'm the nanny. Who sent you? Nobody! Did they send you to fuck with me? Nobody sent me! I'll burn your fucking eye out you fucking cunt! Stop, please! I just want to help Olivia, okay! Damon is doing the same thing to her. I just want him to stop, okay. Fucking liar! Are you lying to me? No. No! Come on. Please. I fucking love this Liz. Jesus Christ! Don't she know I go to work to get away from her? Take five, ladies. Carly, what's the emergency? You working? No, I'm on a beach in Barbados. Yeah, well I wouldn't put it past you. What's the matter? You bored? 'Cause I can throw these quips at you all day long if you want. I'm sure the little girl will find herself. And what about your child's missing father? Oh, brilliant. I'm actually in her room right now. Whose? Olivia's. Poor girl. Yeah, the decor's awful. The parents are monsters. I got a phone call today. Oh, yeah? Well I've had about ten from you. Oh, well fine. I won't tell you. No, go on. I'm on the edge of my seat. No, just forget it. Babe. No, look, if you wanted to marry your work, then maybe you shouldn't have married me. Twat! Sorry about that. Right, where were we? Big-wig paedophile politicians. Oh, my favourite. Come on, indulge me. What? Give me what you've got. What's wrong with him? Many things. Tell me more about the nonce. Holloway, fuck off, will ya! What? Who was the man that you went out to see? There is no man. Come on now, you're a pretty girl. There's no significant other? No friend with benefits? I don't have time for this. See now, what I really want to know is if you claim to care about Olivia so much, if you love her like a mother, then why the fuck would you leave her in a house full of pedophiles? Because he - Speak up, please. Because he threatened my daughter. Who did? That evil piece of shit Damon Truman. What are you doing? She was thirsty. I'll take care of her. It's all right, daddy's here. Goodnight, sweetheart. Can we talk? We have a strange request. We need you to go out for the night. Cinema, or something. My treat. Why? Well, after the party, Claire and I would like some alone time. For my birthday. I won't bother you. Sure, sure, but we'd just like to have the house to ourselves for a few hours. You understand? No. No, you don't understand? Or - No, I'm not leaving. Well, Mariam we pay you. To protect Olivia. So I will. Protect her from who? Her parents? She doesn't need protection from the people who love her. You may have people fooled but not me. What does that mean? I heard everything. Everything? Everything. Okay. How much? How much money do you want? I'm not for sale. Two thousand pounds. Get out of my way. Three. Get out of my way. Four thou- Move or I'll scream. I know you have a child at home that needs the money. How dare you speak about her? How dare you talk about my daughter! A child deserves love, have you none in your heart? Oh, I love my daughter. You don't know how to love. Wait! Get out of my way! And if I don't? I'm calling the police. Don't scream. - Don't! - No, please! Don't fucking move! Now, I don't wanna hurt you, but you are not gonna be the downfall of my family. Those men, they're not just anybody. Andre, well let's just say his family are considered royalty in France. Roma, he's a bit shadier. He protects people like Andre, he protects them from regular people like you. When people like you meddle with people like him, all sorts of horrible things happen to them. They fall down elevator shafts. They're shot by some crazed gunman. Many commit suicide. See, what you are doing, Mariam, is you are committing suicide. And then, who knows, your daughter might fall into the wrong hands. Please. Take the night off. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. God, I'm loving this case. I'm loving it! Aw. You dropped the cakes. How much did you hear? Only the part about us being psychopathic pedophiles. Mm, these are good. You know she's lying, right? I suspect so. Andre is a very decent guy. We are decent people. Were you abused by your father? Excuse me? Sorry- were you abused by your father? That's a bit crass! Of course I wasn't. And neither was Liz! My father loved us. It depends what you call love. Holloway, can I have a word? What the fuck do you think you're doing? What? I'm hungry. I haven't had any breakfast. Is this a joke to you? Little word of advice. Don't get too emotionally attached, it's only gonna cloud your judgement. You could be a wee bit more delicate. Do you think a bloodhound lets its feelings get in the way of its nose? No. You're no bloodhound, and you're acting like a prick. The parents are the victims as well. There's only one victim here and she's missing. No! What's happened? Turn the telly on. We're live in Claygate where police have discovered a body. Chief Superintendent Hanson is making a statement now. We'll pass you over. One of the search and rescue teams found a body in the wooded area of Claygate. We've sent our forensic team and pathologist to try and identify the body. However it is yet to be confirmed whether it's the missing girl Olivia Truman or not. Chief. Is it her? Probably. Are you with the Trumans? Yep. Try and keep them away from the press. They're not going anywhere. I've spoken to the nanny. And? She's claiming it was the parents. Pretty fucking convincingly too. Any evidence? No, not yet. Right, then do me a favour. Back off. You're great at finding people but this is national. All eyes are on us. The parents are the victims. Yeah, well there's a kooky little demographic in this country that agree with me and think they're suspect as fuck. I'm not gonna have my people come under fire for harassing the victims. Babysit the parents but do not pursue any line of questioning with them. Clear? Crystal. Fuck. I just found these upstairs. Oxycodone, whose are they? Mine. I've got sciatica. Damon, you're a chemist - I'm in pharmaceutical sales. Same thing. What's the side effects on a drug like that? There's many. Let's say on a child. Drowsiness. Sleepiness. Death? In some rare cases. Holloway, the body hasn't been identified yet. Oh, that's right! 'Cause she's still out there, eh? 'Cause Romanian traffickers came into your house, in the middle of a party, and took her from under your noses. Bloody immigrants, first they're taking our jobs and now they're taking our children. Is this funny to you? I can assure you it's not. I'd like you to leave my house. You know, it's almost like you don't want us to find her. Let's hope you never have to pull your daughter out of the ground. We should leave. I'm telling you, they did it. You've lost your mind. Clearly. You know, this is what happens when you let a psychopath gaslight you. So, you agree. He's a cunt. I was talking about Mariam. I saw it in his eyes. Do you know what a young British girl with blonde hair and blue eyes is worth to human traffickers? Take a guess. I dunno, a million rubles? A hundred grand. They use nannies like Mariam to research their hosts for months and months waiting for the right time to strike. And what better time than the night of a big party? A night when dozens of people will be suspects. Olivia just happened to go missing on this night of all nights. What you're seeing in his eyes is anger, Danny. Anger that any man would feel for losing a child. Even you. Fucking hell. I gotta answer this. You all right, babe? Not really. Look, sorry about earlier. I know I've not been around much, it's just this case. Yeah, look, it's not what I called about. I had an odd phone call. Go on. Some bloke asked "how's your daughter?" What? Yeah. Carly, where's Lucy? She's at school. Do me a favour. Go and get her from school. Take her straight to your mum's. Should I be worried? No, there's nothing to worry about. Listen Carly, go upstairs, right hand side of the wardrobe, top shelf, there's a little case in the corner. The key to that case is on the little elephant, my side of the bed. Don't freak out but there's a gun in there. Jesus, Dan! Listen, it's just a precaution. I'm sure it's someone just playing silly buggers. Can't you come home? Go and get her. Okay? I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Yeah, got it! What? What? Rob's called, Liz is back. Right. Here, get that down you. Come on. That's it. There we go. Can we ask you a few questions, please? This isn't the best time, is it? Oi! Wakey wakey. Roma's phone. Where is it? Rob, who are they? We're your ghosts of Christmas past, love. Time to wake up. Do you have Roma's phone? Liz? Liz, there's probably nothing on that phone. And it's possible Mariam just sent you on a wild goose chase but we need to verify it. To clear your sister's name and also start the process of extraditing Mariam back from Romania. But what if - but what if there is something on it? Well, is there? It was locked. I can unlock it. Yeah, I can just plug it into my laptop, run some software. There's Gecko, Redsnow. You're a bit of a geek, yeah, kinda got that. Well. You get the phone, you grab your laptop. Chop, chop. Don't you have your own people to do this sort of thing. Yeah, well, you've offered now. I just wanna make sure I'm not breaking any laws. As far as you're concerned, I am the fucking law. Then you'll know all about privacy and investigatory powers then, won't you. Just unlock the phone. Okay. Hanson. Yes, sir? At Rob Tyler's flat, sir. They asked us to leave. Why, what's happened? Is it her, sir? Right. Okay, keep me posted. He wants us back at the Truman's. He's gonna meet us there. I'm not leaving this here. Pack it up. You're coming with us. What's happened? Police have confirmed that the body is that of a young girl between the age of ten and fifteen. But they're reluctant to say if it's Olivia Truman until it's been identified by the pathologist and the parents. It's not been confirmed yet. How many dead children do you know that are in those woods? How long's this gonna take? I dunno. It's a fingerprint lock which makes it a little more complicated. I thought you were an expert. I work in IT, not GCHQ. Yeah, well you've got ten minutes. I'll do my best. Ten minutes or I'll arrest you for withholding information. And what information is that exactly? The information on that phone. Such a dick. Liz. Mariam told us you were abused by your father. Is it true? Danny, I don't think now's the time! Am I not being delicate enough? Listen to me, Liz, I like you. You're honest. You know, apart from banging that slick Frenchman in the toilet behind your boyfriends back of course. But I know why you did that. It was to get that phone. Because you've got integrity. See, Liz, despite all your flaws, you're a good person. Now, I need to know whether your father molested you or not, which will bring me straight onto my next question - how the fuck would Mariam know that? I was asking the same fucking question. Hey. Enjoying yourself, I see. It is a party, mommy. You know, Olivia has your hair. Claire. Yes? You haven't told anyone about what happened to us, have you? About what? You don't speak... about our past? What past? Dad. What about him? You know, his ways. What ways? Look, I know we've never talked about it. Talked about what? Claire... he abused us. What? You're my sister, you don't have to lie to me. I think those therapists have been messing with your head. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't do that- Do what? Make out that I'm - that I'm crazy. Tell me. You can... tell me anything. Connect with me. I need to get this cake to Damon. Do you think he'll like it? It's not something I wanted to discuss. Especially not at my husbands birthday party. So it did happen? That's none of your fucking business! Who removed the red ribbon for Andre? Was it you or Damon? You know, I'm thinking it was you. Thirty percent of all abuse victims become abusers themselves. Or they end up with one. You piece of shit! Whoa! Easy Tiger! You're lucky I don't kill you. Well I wouldn't be your first, would I? I want you out of my house. I'm not going anywhere. Get out of my house! Admit what you did! You drugged Olivia. What are you doing? She was thirsty. Then she slipped into a coma. She didn't wake up. Then she died. Then you called your little pal, Roma, to help you get rid of the body. You even opened a window to make it look like a kidnapping. And then they buried her in the woods. Go on, admit it. Set your soul free... if you've got one. I'm not speaking with you anymore. From now on, you can talk to my lawyer. Danny, stop it. Hello, sir? Are they sure? I'll let them know. It's not Olivia. What? It's not her. Are they sure? The pathologist confirmed it. You seem almost disappointed. So it wasn't Olivia? Is that not done yet? It's not far off. Do you really think Claire and Damon did all that? I mean, I actually think they're the most boring couple I know. Shut up. Danny! What? What's the matter? Where've you been? I've been ringing you! What is it? Danny. It's Lucy. Where is she? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? She wasn't at school. The teachers thought that we'd given her a day off. I don't understand. Carly, where is she? I don't know, Danny, she's missing! Danny, I'm scared. I'll call you back. Danny- What? They found the girl's ID with her. Right? Hanson wants you to go down there. Why does he want me to go? Danny. Costa, what is it? They think it's Lucy. He protects people like Andre. When people like you meddle with people like him, all sorts of horrible things happen to them. Who knows, your daughter might fall into the wrong hands. Let's hope you never have to pull your daughter out of the ground. Meeting in London with Slaughter and May, Leila, have the contract ready for my departure. That should be Hanson. I'll get it. That's it. What did you expect? Is that the phone? Aye. And there's nothing on it? Just some legal stuff. Nothing with Damon. Jesus Christ! How could he get it so wrong? I don't know. He's been making jokes all day. It's all a joke until it happens to you. Well, the good news is Olivia may still be out there. Alive. We're extraditing the nanny right now. Her ex-husband is associated with known Romanian gangsters, drug smugglers and even people traffickers. He probably helped her set the whole thing up. This is a French ambassador. Damon is friends with his lawyer. The sister is unstable. She was probably abused as a child. We can use this. How do you know she was abused? I know from personal experience. Well, you are going to be the first person that the police will suspect. So you must create a story to turn their attention onto the parents. Plant the story like a seed and watch it grow. The whole world will believe that the parents did this. Take this. It will help you sleep. Go in when you are ready. Is she asleep? Yes. It's a billion pound industry. We're at war. I tried to tell Holloway but he just wouldn't listen. You did your best. I'll be sure to put you forward for DCI. Thank you, sir. You deserve it. Hi. How's my baby boy? Yeah... I'll be home soon. I know. I just didn't think they would go this far. So, you're saying that your daughter was killed to stop you from investigating this case? That's exactly what I'm saying. Surely, that would only put more pressure on the criminals, wouldn't it? Not if they were trying to send a message. A message to whom? Everyone. Every detective, every judge. Everyone. And what's the message? Not to meddle with powerful people. But I sent them my own message. And what message was that? So, after everything that's happened, are there any any new suspects? There's a few, yes. The police have widened their search to Eastern Europe. So the police believe that she's part of a child trafficking ring? They believe so. Then it's likely she's still alive. Yes, it's the only good thing to come out of all of this. Of course. It must be a relief knowing that. Knowing that she's out there gives us hope. Do you believe that you'll still find her? I believe we will, yes. I have to. Damon? I think as long as we can continue our search globally, then... yes, we'll find her. One day. We'd like to thank the public... for all the support they've shown us over the last few weeks. And how can others show their support? We have a company now set up, The Olivia Foundation. and donate through there. Any help you can give will help us keep the search active because... the police can only do so much. And if Olivia was listening now, what would you say to her? Stay strong, darling. We will bring you home. Damon? Just - I love you. Keep that pointed at me! I'm gonna tell you a little story. See, I'm no better than the Trumans. I cared more about my progress than I did my own child. But not any more. The Romanians didn't do this. There's a very powerful network of people buying children straight from their parents and I'm coming for all of them. And that includes you, Costa. Okay, that's enough, cut there.
