[ Woman ] Metal spike roulette? Honestly, baby, that was my favorite part of your book. Like, seriously. You hide a metal spike under a cup... and take turns betting until someone hits the cup with the spike? How crazy were you guys? [ Russian Accent ] We were young and stupid. It was a long time ago, so we don't really talk about it much anymore. Tell me the trick. Come on. How did you know where to find the metal spike? I want the whole thing. Metal spike, the roulette? Everything, baby. Please? I know you won't get hurt. If you do it for me, I will do anything you want. Baby, you've given me anything I want for five years now. Yes. But you know my girlfriend Selena? I do. She hasn't, and I promise you, if you show me this trick, that you'll have both of us. Can you hurry up and start doing this, please? Okay. Close your eyes. Okay. Are you ready? I'm ready. [ Gasping ] Oh, my God. How did you know that? I didn't. The trick was just to not give a fuck. [ Typing ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Speaks Russian ] She's marrying Stephan Abramov? [ Woman, Russian Accent ] He uses Arbarn now. He's not like his father. You'll see. Yeah, I understand that, but why am I always the last to know? Lanie was afraid to call. She knew how upset you'd be, but, Ruslan, she wants you here. I really think she needs you. It's tomorrow afternoon. I'm hoping you can catch a flight. Oh, believe me, I'll be there. That's wonderful. Your daughter will be very happy, Ruslan. You have a pen? I know where you live, Katya. We moved. What happened? It's a long story, and it's not a very happy one. We'll catch up when you get here. [ Speaks Russian ] I'll go get a pen. [ Plane Arriving ] California? It's that obvious? Hey, too much sun, not enough tenement buildings, you know? You don't get sandwiched amongst enough people, you wind up never knowing any. Ruslan. [ Speaks Russian ] Ruslan. [ Russian ] [ Chuckles, Speaks Russian ] I had a feeling that you'd come back. Oh, my-- [ Russian ] [ Continues In Russian ] No friends, only enemies. Loyalty cost us everything, Brot. Loyalty between you and me-- Da. cost us our freedom for five years. Mm-hmm. Five fucking years in the Gulag. There are not many of us left who remember those days. [ Russian ] Please tell everyone? Yeah? I'm back here only on personal business. Ofcourse I will, but I'm not sure they would believe it. Well, I don't care. It's personal business-- family business. Absolutely, absolutely. I'll get the message to Mikhail. The guy in California is writing a book about your life. I read it too, and I think your enemies read it too, and because ofthat, I want you to have this. Be careful, Ruslan. Okay? [ Russian ] Welcome back. Do svidaniya. [ Russian ] Brot, do svidaniya. [ Russian ] [ Speaks Foreign Language ] He asked you a question. You know, I wasjust leaving. [ Man ] Too late for that, huh? You offended us. You need to be punished. It'd be really nice if I could just leave, you know. [ Chuckles ] It's not gonna happen. Oh, fuck! Okay, now I guess it's you and me. Fuck. I'm so sorry. I'm not like you. I'm just a pretender. Didn't you say, "If someone does something bad, hejust has to be punished"? No, no, it's a joke. Joke? Get down on your knees. This will be the first time... you ever are punished for telling a bad joke. - [ Groans ] - [ Russian ] I'll go to get my broom. Do svidaniya. Ruslan? You forget who's paying for this damn thing. I should get a say in who goes. He's her father. She wants him there. Do you want him there? Leave me alone, Terry. I asked you a question. What is the question? Do I want a real man to give my daughter away on her wedding? [ Gasps ] [ Cab Driver] Fancy place. You sayyour wife lives here? - Ex-wife. - Looks like she's throwing one hell ofa party. Somebody getting married? My daughter. [ Distant Chattering ] [ Chattering Continues ] [ Man ] This one, and this one, please. [ Woman ] Yeah. We're gonna actually? [ Doorbell Rings ] Come on in. You must be Ruslan, the guy who writes the snuff books. Yeah. Terry Goldstein. I'm Catherine's husband. I'm also a defense attorney, so I defend guys like you. I mean, the guys in your books. [ Speaks Russian ] [ Russian ] [ Russian ] You have met Terry? Yeah, we werejust talking about my books. Seems like he's a fan. He should be. And you? You've done a great job with my baby. When was the last time I saw you? Graduation? No, law school. She's a prosecutor now at D.A.'s office. [ Chuckles ] And where is she? She's upstairs. The limo arrives in three hours to take us to the church. Try to convince her that if she doesn't wear the veil, she'll end up looking like a Victoria's Secret model. [ Russian ] Okay. [ Ruslan ] Hey. Dad? I've missed you. I've missed you too. - So, what did she say? - You're more beautiful than ever. Which I knew. And that I shouldn't be late for the wedding. Did she say anything else? There was some arguing on the phone. Yeah, the guy she married's a bit ofa prick. I met him downstairs. I want you to meet my fianc?. Ruslan, nice to meet you finally. My name is Stephan Arbarn. Nice to meet you. You know, um, maybe I can spend a few moments with him... and talk a little--you know. I'd like that. It's important to me. The limo and the church? It can wait. Ah,just a few minutes. Remember those stories Ruslan used to send you when you were small? Yeah, the dragon and the little blind girl? She used to think that he wasjust a swan, and he never wanted her to figure out otherwise. It's kind of sad. Don't blame your father for that. Stephan is my life now. Do you need your father's approval to keep feeling that way? I learned a long time ago he wants us to have what he cannot give. I'm glad he came today. [ Speaking Russian ] [ Russian ] Gangster? Whoa. I think we're getting offon the wrong foot. My father is the gangster, and he wants me to follow in his-- Footsteps. Yeah, I know. Then you met Lanie. And she expects more from me. Yeah. Let me ask you? Do you think Mikhail might blame my daughter or me... for taking you offthe path? Look, my father's old-school Russian. He expects me to come crawling back someday-- maybe to turn into someone like you. You don't know me. And all the people I worked with? None ofthem lived to tell the story. Then we won't speak about it. That would be best. [ Russian ] [ Chattering ] When they leave, we go in. [ Woman ] All right. We'll bring it around back. Hey, Lanie. I don't want to disturb you. I, uh? I know you already have a ring. This... belonged to my mother. She was from St. Petersburg, and she was very beautiful,just like you. I would love for you to have this. [ Chattering, Faint ] [ Footsteps ] [ Stephan ] Lanie, Terry's gonna drop me offat the church. We can drop Ruslan off at his hotel on the way. Whose ring? Thank you, Daddy. It's beautiful. I know how valuable it is to you, so I'll wear it and I'll treasure it. Why don't I put this over here for later? for the wedding ceremony. [ Ruslan ] I'll, uh, go to the hotel and get changed and meet you at the church. I'll have Terry pick you up. Well? I mean, I can take a taxi. Daddy, please. For me. You have to learn to get along. Okay. And, Daddy, don't judge Stephan too hard or too fast. If you're happy, I'm happy. And you're happy, so go on. [ Man ] This is the last ofthe flowers. Where should I put them, Mr. Goldstein? [ Goldstein ] How the hell should I know? Ask my wife. [ Door Creaks, Closes ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Muffled ] No! No! No! [ Muffled Shouting ] [ Knife Slicing ] [ Scream Echoes ] ?? [Jazz, Faint ] - [ Phone Beeps ] - [ Man ] Hello? Yeah, Goldstein, I thought, you know, for Lanie's sake, you and I should? Look, look, look. I need you to hang on a minute, okay? Something's happened here. I need you to talk to my sergeant. Hello? Hello? Hello? [ Phone Snaps Shut ] [ Man ] Yeah, let him through. [ Officers Chattering ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Man ] You talk to both ofthem? [ Chattering ] [ Man #2 ] Wanna bag that? [ Chattering ] [ Man #3 ] We're gonna have to dust for prints in all areas. - [ Chattering ] - [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Exhales ] [ Ruslan ] How is she? Stab wounds. Concussion. She's critical but stable. [ Exhales ] Sharp dresser. Where you from, Detective? The 2-6? Yeah. Like hell. That's my number. What the fuck is this? He's the father. [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] [ Sighs ] [ Siren Wails, Stops ] - We think they were looking for a safe in here. - This was no robbery. Whether this was a robbery or a setup to look like one, we're still gonna check into everything. You do know whose family your daughter was marrying into, right? The husband ofthe girl just arrived. He's not her husband, number one. Number two, we gotta be in agreement? Nobody-- not Goldstein, not Stephan? can know my daughter's still alive. [ Woman ] Yeah, okay. We'll get six ofthose. Mm-hmm. That's best for us too. [ Man Chattering ] [ Goldstein ] Who's in charge here? I want to see my wife. Where is she? Oh, my God. Catherine. Where is she? I want to see Lanie. - Is she-- - The body's already been removed from the site. Ruslan, tell me what happened. [ Echoing ] Tell me what happened. Tell me what happened. [ Echoing ] Ruslan. [ Ruslan ] The uniform will be there, da? The end ofthe hall, 24/7. You sure you'll be okay? I could wait and give you a ride back to your hotel. That's a good idea. And do you promise you won't share the fact that she's alive with anyone else? It'll damage our case ifthe killer finds out. That's my daughter. Ofcourse. And you can't think ofanyone in her life who you believe is capable ofdoing this? No. I mean, there are many people who are capable, but, uh, I don't know why anyone would do something like this. You have a past here, right? What do you mean? She was marrying Mikhail Abramov's son. He's Russian mob. Oh, is he? The same group of men you ran with 20 years ago. Who told you that? I'll give you some privacy. [ Monitor Beeping Steadily ] Don't worry, my baby. You're gonna be well. And those who did this to you will cry tears of blood. This I promise you. The cop at the end ofthe wing told me you were here. How's my baby? She sustained some serious internal damage. A sharp object punctured her chest cavity. She's suffered blunt trauma to the head and neck. Doctor, listen to me. When you're gonna talk to me about her, look me in the eyes. She'll recover. It'll take time, but she's very lucky. Let's keep the luck going. Ifthere's anything at all, you call me at this number. Stephan seemed pretty torn up-- naturally, I guess. I mean, you'd expect that, right? Yeah. Listen. I'm gonna pass on that ride home. ?? [ Whistling ] [ Ruslan ] Having a nice day? Sorry. I guess I should have knocked. I lost someone I loved, just like you. So, that puts us in the same boat? Yeah, I guess so. Fact is, I want revenge as much as you. But let's face it? I don't have the same skills in this area as a man like you. What do you know about my skills? I know what I see. You're a dangerous man, Ruslan. You want revenge. So do I. I will find the people who did this. Believe me. I can help you. I don't want to be involved, but I know a man... who can help you get the tools you need for a job like that. Why does that not surprise me? [ Scoffs ] I'm a lawyer. These are the people offwhom I make my money. Now, you know what? I'm gonna write this man's number down right now... because I know you're not gonna want to waste any time. That's true. I won't be. By the way, I, uh? I tried to arrange to have Lanie placed beside her mother, but the morgue wouldn't release the body. When this is over, I will take Lanie's ashes... back home with me. So the lawyer says we're not gonna use any names, Ruslan from L.A. So you go to Wal-Mart for your clothes but not your guns, huh? What, you can't wait? You got a little problem with the wife? No. [ Clicks Tongue ] [ Man ] So what do you need? Sure shot? Hole in the door? Spray the school yard? - Thirty-eight. - You know disco's dead, right? Thirty-eight doesn't leave brass. Maybe I can test-fire just a little bit. You a cop? 'Cause I'm starting to get that feeling. No. [ Clicks Tongue ] Shooting little bit far to the left and high. Maybe I can have another shot. [ Gun Clicks ] [ Chamber Clicking ] [ Ruslan ] See? It's good now. So, let me payyou guys. You look familiar. We do business before? [ Cell Phone Rings ] - Never met. - [ Rings, Beeps ] Well, I don't like this. There's something about you that's off. You patted him down good, yeah? Yeah. Look, brother, this is good money. Let me payyou and get the fuck out of here. Just hold on to that for a second. He talks like a cop, Dino. That's exactly the kind of entrapment shit a cop would say. What's this? It's from the man. No shit. This note's about you. It's not good. ?? [ Hard Rock ] Fuck! ? Late last night I went to sleep and found myself? [ Grunts ] ?? [ Continues ] ?? [ Continues ] [ Clicks ] [ Bone Cracks ] [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Blows Landing ] ?? [ Ends ] [ Beeps ] Told you I wasn't a cop, bitch. ?? [ Russian Traditional ] [ Door Opens ] Ruslan. Oh, please, Ruslan. I just finished cleaning after your last visit. You shouldn't have to clean up. What he is doing here? It is-- I'm not going to hurt him. Don't worry. Okay? Don't worry. Don't worry. [ Laughs ] ?? [ Ends ] [ Applause ] - [ Speaks Russian ] - You loved my daughter, right? Why are you asking me that? [ Door Opens, Closes ] Well, I see you brought your daddy. [ Man ] Ruslan. Misha, Misha, Misha. You're back. If I said it's good to see you again, I would be lying. Please, sit now. And you, my son? You still recognize me. I suppose I should be grateful. Sorry about Katya and your daughter. Can't even imagine how bad you must feel now. And Stephan? He's very sad over-- [ Ruslan ] Yeah, I'm sure he's sad. Well, I do really hate to go away from here thinking... in any wayyou can blame my son for whatever that scum did to your family. I've come here for a reason, and that is... I feel that, uh, you have to come with me to get revenge. - I told you I'm not a gangster. - Yeah, but listen. You don't have to be a gangster... to take revenge when someone kills your wife or your child. This is what any real man would do. - What do you have in mind? - Take a ride. Ask some questions. Look around. See what I can see. That's the Ruslan I remember. And what if you come up dry? I'll leave. Take my daughter's ashes and go. You and I? We were raised by the same code. Don't forget that. He has to do this. If he's a real man, he has to do it. [ Door Opens ] [ Man ] Get the hell out of here. [ Russian ] Il ya? [ Russian ] Said you're never gonna be back. We had a deal. You know, life is a funny thing. No one can tell what the future will bring. [ Il ya ] We had a deal, Mikhail. A pact. Now you're here. After everything, you treat me with no respect, huh? Respect? You have to earn this. Remember who you're dealing with. [ Russian ] [ Continues In Russian ] Let's go. [ Russian ] Follow them. Be ready if I call. Mind your manners. Forget about him. [ Speaking Russian ] [ Russian ] What the fuck is going on here between you guys? I just don't believe it. Let's talk about it. Talk about what? Talk about old times. About Ruslan. And how you're going to help me kill this cocksucker. [ Laughs ] [ Man ] Yeah? No, bring it. Over here. Where are we going? I'm looking for a wedding ring. [ Man Chattering ] [ Bell Dinging ] - You know this guy? - Sure, I know him. I pay his daddy money once a month. I'm gonna get a refund? We're looking for a ring. It probably came in last night. Do I know you from somewhere? He's a white guy with a tattoo on his neck. - Probably thought it was? - Real valuable, yeah. At first glance, it does. But if you study the stone up close, it's flawed. Low carats. Yeah, maybe no value to you, but to some people could be very important. [ Scoffs ] You're saying they broke in to steal your ring? You know, this is the way you follow things. Through something like this, you might find who you're looking for, you know. Yeah. So, let me ask you again? The white guy with the tattoo on his neck-- This is a pawn shop, pal, not an information booth. You know, somehow I feel... like you talk a little too tough. [ Screams ] [ Groaning ] - Get the surveillance tape. - [ Whimpering ] [ Sobbing ] Oh, God! - [ Sobbing, Groaning ] - [ Tape Ejects ] [ Speaking Russian ] [ Cell Phone Dialing ] [ Line Ringing ] Where are you? Theyjust came out ofa pawn shop on Wade. Ruslan was holding a ring box. Stephan seemed fine, but I heard screams inside. What should I do? Stay with them. Ruslan so much as takes a shit, I know about it. We'll be done with this fucker soon. [ Affirms In Russian ] What if he spots me? You think he hasn't already? [ Doors Close ] Did you hear the address he gave me? Just the projects. South tower. No apartment number. Believe me, we won't need one. - What's going on? - We have to make the cockroaches come out, and then we catch them. Jesus! [ Screaming ] [ Speaks Russian ] [ Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Man ] What's going on? Big guy, green coat. Go! Think that's the cops? I'm not staying long enough to find out. [ Stephan ] What ifthere's all these guards with guns? Don't get shot. And stay behind me. [ Door Opens, Closes ] Keep low and stay close. [ Man Shouts ] Down the hall! [ Grunts ] This fucking guy is crazy! Let's get outta here! Go! Go! [ Clicks ] [ Grunts ] [ Groaning ] [ Groaning Continues ] The girl in the mansion? Ah, shit! [ Grunts ] That was my child. Now, was this a robbery? Ah, shit! [ Ruslan ] Or someone paid you to do this? Just so you know, asshole, I wasn't there. But I wish I was. - She'd have died a lot slower. - [ Gunshot ] [ Whimpers ] [ Gun Hits Floor ] [ Shouts In Russian ] You know what my next question was gonna be? Does he know you? You think that I? And then, if I liked the answer, it was gonna be, "Who sent you?" I fuckin' loved her, Ruslan. At least I was there. We need information. Now we have fucking nothing. I never killed anyone before. You don't think I was gonna kill him when I got the information? Pick up your fucking gun! Learn to respect the tools of your trade. Let's go. [ Man ] Stephan and the old man are heading east. Da, da. The kid's doing fine. I'm on my way. Da. I got the message too late. I'm at the place. Where you at? You took the fucking wedding ring? Tell me you weren't that stupid! No. Look, you said to take whatever was lying around and make it look like a robbery. And now my son's out there playing vigilante. I know. Because I lost one of my men. And ifthings went to plan, Stephan was the one who killed him. What? Plan? Always easy the first time out if you're convinced they deserve it. No, wait, wait, wait. You hired us to be the ones? Killers I got! This was about revenge. About my son becoming what he had to be. And for this, you need something to hunt down, something to kill. So, what, we were fucking bait? [ Shouts, Screaming ] [ Grunting ] God! Ruslan would have searched your dead junkie friend. What would he find? You watch TV? That's what they call a reenactment. You sleazy here? Point me to him, okay? Let me finish this. Let me finish this. I swear to God I'll finish this. You better not screw this up. Because I know where he'll be tonight. [ Grunts ] Let's go. [ Doors Open ] [ Groaning ] [ Doors Close ] [ Engine Starts ] ?? [ Classical ] [ Rings ] - [ Gasps ] - Going somewhere? Jesus, Mickey, you scared the hell out of me. I asked you a question. I just got offthe phone with the cops. They were asking questions about four dead gun dealers. One oftheir cell phone logs says I phoned at the time they were killed. I'm going to Aruba till you handle this. The fuck you are. It's your wife's funeral tomorrow. Cops will be suspicious if you don't show. Please, Mickey. That guy will kill me... with the fucking grave shovel and bury me in front ofthe priest. You don't know what he's capable of. Oh, yes, I do. We're from the same neighborhood. And that's why I know his next move. We have leverage. Fuck leverage. I'm gonna kill everything he loves before I kill him. But it's a two-way street. I can't afford to miss or be distracted by the cops. So, you go to that funeral. And Stephan? ?? [ Hard Rock ] - ?? [ Continues ] - [ Patrons Chattering ] ?? [ Man Singing, Indistinct ] ? Ifthis could happen to you ? ? Wake up in a dream and everything is coming true ? ? Hittin' every green light Lady Luck's been on my side ? ? Every station in the nation plays my song tonight ? ? One more time 'cause I'm not satisfied ? ? It'll never get much better Just enjoy the ride ? ?? [ Continues, Indistinct ] Stevie. [ Chuckles ] Give me a kiss. How's your dad? Did you get married yet? Just one time before I met Lanie. Yeah, yeah. One time. Right. ?? [ Continues, Indistinct ] Make sure she put them in the back room, okay? ? Monday And I still got the blues ? ? Goin' nowhere You know I've been there I'm tired of payin' my dues ? ? A double shot ofcourage won't make it go away ? ? But one day, baby one day maybe ? ? It could happen to me ?? ?? [ Continues ] Is it supposed to feel like this? Losing someone? Killing someone. Well, there's two kinds of people? Those without a heart maybe even enjoy it. They don't feel nothing. People like you and me, for us it never gets any easier. But we'll always have our reasons. Then what are we doing here? As you know, this is a place that has lots of interesting bad guys. And even though we're looking for them, I have a feeling they're also looking for us. So... probably we don't have to wait too long. Huh. Ruslan is in the back. Mikhail said that ifthe kid doesn't come out of here alive? I only got two ears. Oh, yeah, with some brains between too. - ?? [ Continues ] - What are you doing? Stretching. Ruslan! I got orders to take you to a meeting. Quietly. [ Grunts ] See? No guns. Knives, they don't make any noise, you know. I've never been someone who could, uh, run from a knife fight. [ Grunting ] [ Speaking Russian ] [ Man ] Come on! Kill the motherfucker! [ Grunting Continues ] [ Groaning ] - [ Bone Crunching ] - [ Groaning Continues ] [ Man Speaks Russian ] Your dad's waiting out back. [ Shouts In Russian ] What's my father doing here? Oh. [ Chuckles ] Oh, you didn't know. It was your dad who left you alone at the altar. Now go. - Come on, man! - [ Tires Squealing ] Move it! Move it! Stephan, get in the car. I can explain. We didn't want any harm coming to her. It was an accident. She was collateral damage. - Stay out of my life! - Get in the fucking car, Stephan! [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Sirens Continue Wailing ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Speaking Russian ] [ Russian Continues ] [ Russian ] [ Speaking Russian ] [ Groans ] [ Woman ] Oh, my God! [ Man ] This way! Come on! We're out! Hurry up! Let's get out of here! - [ Woman ] Hurry! - Freeze! Freeze! In here! Over here! - Put down the knife! Drop it! - Nobody move! Pawn shop owner got himself beat badly. Two guys. One ring. Sounds like gay marriage. Dead body at the projects. Have you been spending any time on my daughter's case? The bouncer went crazy. All right? I guess he thought I should be stuffing dollar bills down his G-string. He's the guy that killed my buddy. What about this guy, Ruslan? He's a hero. Hmm. Your ear? How'd that happen? Wasn't the first club we hit. You write books, Ruslan? Hmm? Thef don't have your name on them, but they sure sound like you. "FrankieJ. trembled, his palm wavering across those last milk shake cups, "thinking ofthat hidden spike as if it wasn't just chance at play, but cruel fate. "And his friend's voice goaded him across the table-- 'You want to be a tough guy?"' Everybody want to be a tough guy. But nobody want to pay the price. What, you couldn't talk Il ya out of it? He needed another hole in his head? I don't know anything about that. I think we're done here. I could charge your client with murder right now. More than one. Oh, sure, when you come up with a witness with the balls to actually testify, or a dead body in a strip club who a jury doesn't think deserves killing, we'll trade phone calls. You want me to sign the book? Maybe later. So, what'd you get? What do you think? Same B.S. you got. Goldstein got Ruslan out for one reason and one reason only-- so Mikhail could finish thejob killing him, and we're going along with it. This is bullshit. Well, in case you haven't been keeping score ofthe body count, my money's on Ruslan. You suck. You just hate it when I'm right. [ Goldstein ] She knows more than she can prove, but they're going to be watching you from now on. [ Ruslan ] And the guys from the strip club? I sprung them a couple of hours ago. Uh-huh. You know that guy you sent me to, uh, to buy those things? He got a phone call while I was there and then started to act very strange. So he has mood swings. What do you want me to do? Nothing. I took care of it. Good. Fine. I'm in the parking lot across the street here. Have you seen Stephan recently? Why? No reason. I haven't seen him around. You think Stephan had something to do with it? Why? Mikhail Abramov. You know him? Yeah. He was a client once. Double homicide. He walked. Warm, friendly guy? [ Chuckles ] Cold as ice. You mind driving? I've got to make some calls. Let me ask you something. When Lanie told me that she met Stephan in court, was she representing him? [ Shotgun Cocks ] You really didn't stay in touch, did you? No. I'm kind ofa dinosaur. Catherine never said too much about what you knew. Well, I think that's maybe because she didn't trust you. At least she married me. I gave her more than you ever could. You think? Oh, and Lanie and Stephan? She was prosecuting him. She had joined the district attorney's office. She said she was sick of people getting away with murder. What is that, some kind of family in-joke? Yeah, and she was going to marry the son ofa big-time gangster. How did Mikhail feel about that? Concerned. He hated the idea of his son marrying your daughter. Yeah. Who do you think it was that tried to talk Stephan into changing his life? Lanie. And Catherine? Made a lot of bad investments. Junk bonds mostly. And I had a lot ofdebt with Stephan's dad. She was going to blow the whistle on me and all my side deals. So you decide to have them killed... so you wouldn't have to go tojail. Yeah. That and the big insurance policy I took out on her should take care ofall my problems. You know, I have a feeling... your troubles arejust beginning. [ Chuckles ] [ Car Alarm Chirps ] [ Laughing ] [ Car Door Shuts ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Man ] There's another car across the lot. Now you're going to take it slow and easy. Move. Why don't wejust do this thing right here? No, we've got better plans for you. Look, if I don't kill you, he will. Well, how the fuck are you going to do that with your eyeballs bouncing offthe fucking cement? Mikhail knows you guys are expendable. [ Russian ] ...from the Gulag. That's it. [ Gunshot ] [ Groaning ] [ Clicking ] Ready for lunch? I'll let our people know. Thanks. We gotta go. Shots fired in the garage on 1 2th. - One guess who's involved. - Let's go get him. [ Yelling ] Get up-- [ Russian ] [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] [ Grunting, Groaning ] [ Whispers ] All right. [ Whimpering ] [ Sirens Wailing, Faint ] He's with me. Let him pass. What the hell is so important... we couldn't talk over the phone? You looking for a free meal? This is serious shit, Mikhail. I wouldn't be here unless it was. Better be. You get paid to keep your eyes open, not to socialize. Relax. We're among friends here. Go ahead. The girl? the one from the Goldstein house. She's alive. That is news. The kind that could fuck a perfectly good day. [ Dishes, Silver ware Clattering ] Thanks. [ Female Detective ] This doesn't feel right. You think Goldstein had anything to do with what went down in the parking garage? You think he set Ruslan up? I don't know. Something doesn't fit. Where's the groom that isn't to be? Maybe we should ask Ruslan that. Ofcourse we'd have to find him first. The question is, would I want to? You saw what they did to his women. Pretend it was your kid. Just so you know, I'm not the only guy in a blue suit thinking this way. Justice is served by-- Justice is served by making sure the right people are punished for their crimes. You don't hear me complaining. [ Clears Throat ] You're going to write me a ticket, Sam? [ Engine Starts ] [ Gasps ] Stephan, please calm? Don't? Don't do this. Only four people in that room heard Lanie say that Ruslan's ring was valuable. You don't know what I've? You're the only one who could have told them where to find it. This is murder. You will do hard time. Not if I get a good lawyer. Lanie would not have wanted this for you. [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Ringing Continues ] - Hello. - You asked me to call ifthere were any changes. - Is there a problem? Well, the police officer at the end ofthe wing, he's not there anymore. Listen to me. Immediately you move her now. You take her where no people would be. You understand? There's an abandoned wing. I'll move her there. We need to go to the hospital immediately. - The hospital? - Lanie's alive. - You've got to be fucking kidding me. - I don't joke about my daughter. Now, Mr. Goldstein, you better pray... none of your friends get there before I do. People said you left this life behind. You hurt me, you fall right back into it. I'm way back already, believe me. All three are inside. We've been watching. Cops? No. No one tailed them from cemetery. And no drive-bys since. - Police response time? - We can draw the two patrol cars to the far edge oftown. We're having some ofour people dial 9-1 -1 and report an officer down. That leaves the units from Dickerson Station. Peak hour on Central Avenue. Even with their sirens, that gives us 1 0 minutes at least. Will 1 0 minutes do it? I want that son ofa bitch and his daughter killed. We'll get it done. Who cares if real cops show up? By the time they figure out who we are, they'll be dead. - This isn't going to be surgical, boss. - You think Ruslan would be? If he comes gunning for me, pull the car around back. Might buy ourselves some time. You're not gonna believe this. The answer has been under our noses the whole time. - Spit it out, already. - The other guy, Goldstein? he took out a life insurance policy on his wife just before she was killed. Let's bring him in. The question is, where is he? Right. Shoot anybody that comes through the door. Your father and his men are on their way. Don't leave my daughter's side, no matter what you hear. Uh-huh. Please...just let me go. I'll turn myself in. You know? [ Russian ] I have a bullet for you waiting. [ Door Opens ] [ Grunts ] [ Alarm Ringing ] I thought you said we had more time. We'll handle it, boss. - Stephan isn't to be hurt. - [ Chattering, Shouting ] [ Man ] Get all the people in the I.C.U. and move 'em out here. [ Woman ] This way. This way. Let's go. Let's go. [ Woman ] There's nothing to be worried about. I.C.U.'s all clear. Let's go. Hurry. Help me push this against the door.

Got shots fired, East Lawn Hospital. I'll let our people know. Thanks. Ruslan's already there. They're impersonating cops. Well, why don't we wait and let him kill everyone and then just show up and sign the paperwork? Mm-hmm. [ Chuckling ] [ Grunts ] This motherfucker can shoot through anything. - [ Machine Gun Fire ] - That's your father. He'll explain everything. - Nothing could explain this. - I'm not the bad guy here! I didn't pull the trigger! - You might as well have. - [ Groans ] [ Yelling ] [ Yells ] - [ Speaking Russian ] - Alex is dead! He's got me pinned! [ Yelling ] [ Yells ] [ Shouting In Russian ] [ Yelling ] Go, go, go! Go! [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Yelling ] Clear! [ Chattering, Shouting Continue ] We'll split up here.

I don't care whose game we play. I just care about who gets to walk away to tell the story. Fuck you and fuck your story. Now you're going to die. Let's see you walk away from this. - [ Gunshots ] - [ Shouts In Russian ] [ Russian ] [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Woman ] Let's go! Let's go! - [ Man ] Get to the O.R. now! My father? He's dead. I'm sorry for the grief he caused you. Me too. Look. [ Speaking Russian ] Take him the fuck out of here. - Fuck that. - No, Stephan, please! No-- [ Russian ] No. You don't act like me. And you don't act like your fucking father. You want to marry my daughter? Behave the way she wants you to. Now get him out of here. [ Handcuffs Clicking ] [ Groans ] [ Door Opens, Closes ] Oh. Wake up, my daughter. Daddy, I love you. [ Men Chattering ] - There they are. Got it? - Yeah, we got it. Let's go. Move it out. [ Male Detective ] Terry Goldstein, you are under arrest... for solicitation to commit murder, murder and racketeering. Now turn around, please. You're going for a ride.
