Excellent, that's really cute. Excellent, keep it up. So perfect. Next, with your legs on the couch. That's it, that's it, so pretty. Yesss. Yes, that's it. Ah, great, beautiful. Very sexy. Great meal. Thank you sir. Thank you sir. Please go buy eggs. Yes, Ma'am. Who is it? Ah, wrong number. Don't lie, it's your ex, right? What? Are you jealous? Why would I be? You know that I'm done with her. But you're still married. It's only tedious paperwork now. Let me help you forget your troubles. Hold me tight. Be careful. Oops, I tripped. - Are you OK? - It's dangerous. Be careful. Don't, not now. I'll be fine. That was scary. Hey, what are you doing? Just wait, wait. Wait. - Wait a minute. - What is it? This one seems even stronger than the other. It's really potent. What is it? You're taking vitamins for me? Nope, I'm not. Come on, you can tell me. Hey, can you feel it? Wow, that's awesome! It's already so hard. You see? Awesome. You're so strong. I'm scared. No, don't. Let me help you with that. Today we'll do the "sushi roll". What? The "sushi roll"? What is that? Eh? Eh? What is that? No! Hey! Hey! I'm not a sushi roll. There, there. What are you doing? What? You're scaring me. What is this? What do you want? Wait a minute. I hate that. Come on. Beware, it's hard. Ouch. No, don't! No, wait! You can't do that! Please, stop. Isn't this wonderful? Yes, it's really good. Wonderful! It's wonderful. Did you do that to your wife? Of course not! She hates surprises, she'd get upset. And now we sleep in separate beds. Eh? In separate beds? She kicked me out because of you. Eh? She's scary. That's when she became independent... and opened her own café. I think it's working well. So she's independent financially. Right. What's this? It's so late already. Who is it? My friend working at Max Magazine. He's even dating my ex. Sorry, I have an appointment. But it could be over in an hour. Sorry, I have to go. And we had a great time. Indeed. - Hey. - Hey. Right on time. You have a guest? We were doing a shooting. You bet, a "shooting". My model, Ms. Mika. This is Mr. Mikasa from Max Magazine. - Hi, I'm Mr. Mikasa. - Hi, I'm Ms. Mika. She poses in magazines. She's 26... and a generous G-size cup. - Have a look. - Give me a break! Pleased to meet you. Pleased to... What was that about? See ya. You took your phone I hope. You're dating? We've just met twice. Don't tell Rieko. The first time she forgot her phone. So she had a good excuse to come back. The usual trick. Rieko was upset you were not picking up. You're going to marry her, so what does she care about me? Hey you signed the divorce form. But Rieko has to come pick up her stuff. She must come in person. Right. I'll come with her on Sunday. That's why she called you. What time is good? Well, right after 12. OK, let's make it 1 o'clock. You have peculiar tastes. Marrying such a woman. But you did marry her. That's why I can advise you. Thanks, I'll pass. Did you do the 'play' with her? What 'play' is that? Come on, I told you... She likes it when you pour lemon juice on her and lick her. But she didn't ask for it. So you don't like this 'lemon play'? It's not like that. But since she didn't ask for it... If you don't spice it up, she'll resent you. She hates dull sex. We don't need you to worry, thanks. A lemon would spice up your dull sex life. Enough with that! Sorry, let's get to work. Right. Welcome. Would you like to order? A 'morning set' with an American coffee. Sorry, the morning set is only available until 11. Just an American coffee will do, then. Could I see the owner? Yes, I'll call her. There's a customer asking for you. Hello, what can I do for you? It's a great café. I like the simplicity. That's very kind. Do you live near here? No, a photographer recommended your place. A photographer? He's taking such good care of me... any way he can. I see. He's such a good lover too. I love his "sushi roll"... It's so exciting. Sushi roll? Since he's 'sado' and I'm 'maso', we have a good body chemistry. Are you two dating? Dating? I would rather call it 'sensual dating'. But still I'm wondering... I wouldn't mind going steady with him. I see. That's how it is. Here is your coffee. It was a pleasure. I thought she'd called you to complain. "Call the owner" she said. She's my ex's lover. What? No way. Sorry. I'll get back to work. I should be the one complaining. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. But you said you liked me. People often say that in the heat of the moment. But we just had sex? Each of us profits. We scratch each other's back. But I'm not that kind of woman. Look, someone's coming soon. A woman is coming? Someone you don't know. Is she a model too? I'm sure you want to fuck her. Look, in Max Magazine. I took those photos. Isn't that great, I could help you too. Each of us profits. She's cuter than me. Hey, wait. Hey, look, women have been killed. He's killing again. It's scary. He could hide anywhere. Be careful. Hey, are you having a photo-shoot? Rika. I forgot something, here it is. You forgot something again. How did you get in? You gave me a spare key. I didn't. - Sure you did. - You took it. What's your relationship with him? What? What is so funny? You should know... girls like you are real easy to come by. Don't make a scene. You'd lose your job. Please stop that. You'd better tread carefully. I rarely come anyway. Mr. Kamota tricked me. After all I did, I'm suing you. Come on, you can't... Do as you wish. Hey. A poor girl like you? No judge would listen. You'd better go hide and lick your wounds. You'd get more than you can handle in a fight. What are you saying? Why did you say that? I wish that Jack the Ripper kills you all. Ayumi! What are you doing? Don't tell me that you are apologizing to her. 'Course I am. Eh? I didn't peg you as considerate. Lately girls easily sue us. Because the Olympics are coming. They think raising hell is funny. What does that have to do with the Olympics. I'm looking forward to the end of that commotion. Done. So you told her I am the monster? Oh, come on. Will you do that every time you see me with someone? Maybe then you'd stop flirting around. Mr. Kamota. You're scary. We are not a steady couple. We could be. But I'd embarrass you. Because you're so cute. Tell me, was forgetting your purse an excuse? What if it was? Your vitamins. I had some earlier. So you had sex already. You know you and me is just about sex. Eh? They are so soft. Hey, easy. And then... your round butt. Come on, what are you saying? Hey, what is it going to be today? Kitchen sex. Eh? What is it? Give me your hands. What is that for? You seem to be an expert at this. I am not. Come on, I don't believe you. This way, Ms. Rika is well tied. - Get on the table. - Eh? - Climb up there? - Yeah. - Is it safe? - You'll be fine. Hey, it doesn't look safe. Hey. Hey, wait. What's this? Wait. Hey, what? I can't see anything. Oh, no. No. Alright. You're even more excited than last time. Are you gonna be rough again? Oh, you don't like that? Good! I'm coming. I'm coming now. Don't you dare come. Oh, wait. Wow. You're so hot inside. Hey, you're tightening. That's because... I really like it. See how you like it? And for you? It's amazing. Alright. Very good. You are so tight. I'm so glad... but you just did it with that girl, right? No, I didn't. You did this with your ex? I didn't. I told you before... she was laying there like a stranded whale. I saw your wife. What? You know her? I went to see her today. Eh? Why? I went to her café. What are you saying? I told her sex was great with you. She turned green. What? Ah, is that right? - Eh? - What? What's happening there? - Wait a minute. - Eh? - Wait a minute. - What is it? Are you finished? Hey, where are you going? Ah, well, wait a minute. Who are you? Mr. Kamota. What's going on? Hey? Mr. Kamota, what's going on? Answer me. What are you doing? Hey, what just happened? Just tell me. Hey, what are you doing? What is this? Hey, what? Hey, what is it? What happened to you? Oh no, I can't. I'm going crazy. What is that? Hey you, what are you doing? You were quick to wake up. Hey? What? You're not Mr. Kamota? I'm the one who unlocks any woman's sexual potential. Because of the shape of my dick. - Who are you? - And so... the sex of a woman relaxes when she comes... to open up for the man's seed and to allow fecundation. That means, you may enjoy her tightness... but that also means that you don't make her come. And so in this way... No, don't. And if you keep thrusting deep, she will keep on coming. No, don't! Don't do that! Help me! Oh, no... I'm coming again. No, no, no, no. Mr. Kamota, Mr. Kamota? What the hell is that? What's going on? Are you OK? He hasn't hurt me. Did he rape you? Fuck. Sorry. I couldn't help you. Right. I'll borrow this. Frozen food is delicious with Chinese condiment. For example this frozen fried chicken... is really good with that Chinese ragout. Don't forget the lemon. These are frozen spring-rolls. Of course the eda beans are not seasoned. If you serve frozen food without preparation. It's like a man unskilled at sex. It makes it tasteless. And the result is not bad at all. You want a taste? Good, isn't it? You don't want any? Maybe it's poisoned. But I ate it. Oh? And yet a woman that I just raped trusts me. Why do you say it only now? Say what? If you believe it's poisoned... why didn't you stop her before? It's just... You think only when you're in danger? Obviously, a person knows what's suited for himself. Really? "Each man for himself", right? It's not like that. I realized it when my turn came. But you wouldn't realize it when she ate? That's exactly the meaning of "Each man for himself". Stop twisting my words. It's alright. What's your name? I'm Rika. Family name? I'm Rika Ichikawa. Some kind of model? I am a model. Not "some kind of". I see, very interesting. I've always wondered why... people in the show-business changed their names. Rika Ichikawa is just perfect. It's just like a stage costume. I could be Rika Ichikawa, Yamada or Watanabe. What is your name? We're not talking about me. So it's the same, you don't use your name. That's a good explanation, I get it. I saw you at that café. I could feel your hopes and desires. The smell of a woman craving sex. Enough, that's a rape. You think you can use us? Do you understand the consequences? Sure, but she was asking for it. I'm just a key to unlock women's desire. No way... Are you Jack the Ripper? I could be him... But maybe I'm not. I heard this Jack the Ripper could be a woman too. Anyway. If you do as I tell you, I won't kill you. That's what Jack always says. I read it in Max Magazine. I could be a copycat then. So there are victims who survived him? It can't be, because these people... surely would have reported him to the authorities. Who knows? What is it? You're enjoying it? I'm enjoying it. So what? No, I'm gonna go crazy. Why is that? Please, fuck me here. No, I won't. I can't wait. Well, I brought you to that point. How did you do that? You can guess. Please, fuck me! If you can't wait, then you take care of it. I get it. You're doing as I say because you want to live. It's just an act but I'm willing to play along. Excellent. You express emotions very well. A real professional model. What is it? You think I'm not good. I don't think that. You're the first who tells me that. That's because you're desperate to please me. This drive makes people naturally good at sex. Keep sucking. You're good. Can you feel it? It's real hard when I'm about to come. I have to stop you, or I'll come. It has to be a reward. I'm coming! I'm coming! What are you doing? You're trying to escape? Stop! You're going to kill him! Tell me, would you like to save him? He proved he doesn't care about you. Alright then, you owe it to her. I'll forgive you this time. Next time you try that... You understand, right? Rieko Calling Who is it? Probably Rieko. She's supposed to come today... to pick up her stuff. She's coming with my friend. That's our chance. What chance? Our chance to escape. But if he catches them too... She's coming with your friend. They can take him on. We didn't manage. That's because... I was tied, to begin with. They don't know that he's Jack. If they are attacked, they'll lose, even two against one. You care so much about your ex? It's not about that. You can't hide it. Mr. Kamota, it's obvious that you still care for her. Don't be silly. If you're so worried... tell this man that guests are coming... and that you need to cancel them. You can't keep that for yourself. I can't tell him. It would trigger his interest in Rieko. Isn't there a better option? What time do they come? He said they'd come at 13:00. I have an idea. We could try it. Say... What is it? We have a photo-shoot today. Don't be stupid... I'm not letting you go to work. Please let me cancel. If I just don't show up, I might lose my job. If you say so. Say... Mr. Kamota introduced them to me. Their number is on my phone. My code is 1919. It's Max Magazine. We need to call Mr. Mikasa. Don't say anything stupid. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Mikasa? Who are you? I'm Rika, the model Mr. Kamota introduced to you. Rika... We met at Mr. Kamota's place yesterday. Ah, I remember you... What is this about? About today's appointment at 13:00... Something important came up, we need to cancel. Really, you guys are so busy, I see. Alright. I'm sorry to cancel so abruptly. How about Mr. Kamota? Well... He's asleep. He seemed really exhausted. Tell him to go easy on "physical exercise". Bye. Nerima District, Tokyo It's that girl. I took a day off for him today. It's fine. We can take a little trip. I'm not letting this go. I still have the key. Hey, how about a little surprise. Don't be childish. He makes us look like idiots. So? Do you like people to watch? No... I don't. Huh? But you seem to enjoy it down there. It turns you on when someone is watching. It turns me on. You like it when the man you love is watching? The man I love? You do love this man. I don't love him. You just consider him a fuck buddy? Yes, and it's the same for him. Do you like sex that much? I'm masochistic. You may pose as masochistic while being a 'sado'. In my experience, 80% of women are like that. If you really are 'maso', how do you like sex? Is that true? Yes. That's interesting. Alright, now you take care of him. What's that? You're useless. I need my usual vitamin drink to get it on. A drink? It's in the kitchen. Where? It's there... The lower cabinet on the right. And also he needs to cover my face. What is that? Mr. Kamota can't have sex if a woman looks at him. Oh? What a weird dude. Rieko. We can still back off. Why is that? Why are you so stubborn? He can lead his sex life anytime. It's basic courtesy to see me today. Are you jealous? That's totally uncalled for. If you didn't care at all, you'd give him a break. It's just that I feel disrespected and I'm upset. Is that so? Anyway, we're here now. Rieko, come on, it's exactly what we thought. Let's go. I'm telling you to stop. What? What is this? First time I catch four people. Who are you? Maybe he is Jack the Ripper. You mean, the serial killer? Who cares. The rule here is to obey me in every way. In every way? If you listen and have sex with him, he doesn't kill you. No! No! Let me go! Let her go! No! Don't! - Stop, please, leave her alone! - Stop, please, leave her alone! What's with you two? You're creeping me out. What are you... No. No, don't! Why did you quiet down? I didn't. You so needed this. You seem to like that. No, I don't. And yet you are so wet. I am not. Alright. I'll put it in. No. I'm coming inside. Alright. You're next. You guys are still married. They're about to get divorced. That's right. Hey... Are you the new boyfriend? What is it to you? Alright. Hey, you have sex with her. Are you crazy? It's probably your last chance to do her. Do it before he takes her away from you. Come on. Not like that. He needs you to roll her up in the cover. So that only her butt sticks out. He was sad that he never did it to her. I see. That's interesting. There... Last chance to have sex with her. How can you? You can do her too. You want to do it to me? Or you'd rather have her? Great! Hang in there! You can make her come today! You did a great job. See, you don't need your vitamin drink. It's your turn. Considering the circumstances... she could be pregnant from either of us. You don't want to be left out. I want lemon. What? Pour lemon on her. Sure. - On me too. - Huh? Her face. I want to see her face. So many requests. Beautiful, a great couple of sex addicts. Turn me around. Turn me around. What? I'm coming. How does it feel? To receive the sperm of three men at once. Isn't that a thrill? Such a cute face. What is it? You can't go? I'm ashamed. So you can share... this moment of shame with me. You see... You let go of your shame and you free yourself. Don't! Don't! What? What is it? It's nothing. Just tell me. Could you kiss me? I didn't figure you'd be such a smart woman. What do you mean? You are attentive to the needs of a man... and easily accommodate his desires. Eh? Until today, you were always faking your feelings. More or less... that's the fate of all women. Same thing for Rieko... Don't compare me to that woman! You dislike her type. She keeps a pretty smile as if everything was OK. I hate women like that the most! When you raped her... I wanted you to destroy her. That's why you warned me they were coming. You may pose as masochistic while being a 'sado'. In my experience, 80% of women are like that. If you really are 'maso', how do you like sex? In a little while his wife is coming here. Is that true? Yes. That's interesting. I thought if you'd rape her, he'd despise her. And now I regret what I did. You pity her now? Surely not. But I saw the way you kissed her... and I hated that. You're declaring your love while sitting on the toilet? But you called her precisely to avoid her coming. I was sure she'd want to come anyway. Oh? At her bar I saw how frustrated she was... at the thought of losing him to me. And if I was the one calling... she'd be flustered and would insist to come. You women are ferocious. But if you hadn't warned me... you would've had a chance to escape. But if you escaped... I would have lost this chance to have more sex with you. Are you craving sex that much? Yes, and I crave only sex. Is that true? Women who are not content with sex... and seeking tenderness, are ridiculed by men. You have a good point. I'm coming! I'm coming! But that woman is a good lay. You think she's better than me? And what if I do? Eh? Don't be disappointed. You were teasing me. But you, taming that woman... I'm looking forward to seeing it. That's great. Good shot. Excellent. Good shot. Great. So sexy. We don't have much time left. What is it? I'm granting you your wish. Get up. Look at me, I'm like a man. So much fun. See, this strap-on... is designed after the shape of my dick. It's a unique piece in the world. With this, you can make any woman come. Hey, have you ever done anal? Let's give it a shot. Alright. Go. You betrayed my trust. This one only has low voltage. This one's the real deal. I just wanted to tie you up for sex. That's a lie. What are you doing? I will dispose of the body. I leave them to you. You should enjoy sex with them. I'm borrowing your car. It's parked out front, right?
