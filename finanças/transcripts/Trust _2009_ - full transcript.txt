Yeah, it's pretty cut-and-dry, Joe. When they're done grilling him, let the Homicide guys know I'll bring everything I got down to the station. Fill in the holes for 'em. She didn't see it coming. No, none of us did. The guy was sick. Pure and simple. Yeah. 7:15. Yeah, I know. Of all the days to be sleeping in. I'm surprised you got any sleep with all that tossing and turning. I'm sorry. Listen, Jenna wants to have dinner with us next week. Where? At La Fleur. Isn't that the place where you have to sell your first kid just to get a window seat? Come on, it's not that bad. Let's just wait and see what we hear today before we commit, okay? Okay. Bill is here. All right, wish me luck. Good luck. You gotta brush your teeth. Okay... Hey, you. Hey. He's gonna be down in just one minute, come here. Hope he had more sleep than I did. I've been up since 4:30. Yeah, okay, so that's what I want to talk to you about. Bill, what is going on here? Because he... he came home last night and he was really upset. What is it? It's just the standard argument. You know, he wants to sell the company, I don't. I mean, he just wants a safety net. It's a sety net. I know, I get it. But if we get this contract, we'll be fine. We'll be better than fine. So you think you're gonna get it? Y'know, our design's better, but X Corp wants the track record, so... Hey, Bill, let's go. Let's go. You sure you don't want me to go with you? Hey, baby, we might not hear 'til after lunch. I don't want you sitting around, worrying all day. Well. Promise you'll call me as soon as it's done? As soon as you know? Of course I will. I'm clicking and nothing's happening. I see what you mean. Don't worry, I can fix that. All right, but it's gotta be done before the show or else I'm dead meat around here. No problem. Anyway, I gotta go. Fine, okay. We still on for Wednesday? Yeah. Hey. Good luck with your date tonight. Thanks. Bye, hon. Bye. Look, I said it an hour ago, I said it last week, I am saying it now. I don't want to sell. Bill, please. Just keep an open mind. I want to own what I've built. Our funding is gone and we have nothing in the pipeline. Well... I'm getting nervous. Look, we know everything there is to know about wireless technology, that's why our design is so great. Nobody has a better heart monitor... nobody! If X Corp Reliant gets the contract without us, we'll lose everything. I know that, but we'll get it. Okay, let's say we do get it. What if something goes wrong? They'll withhold the financing. Where is that gonna leave us? If something's wrong, we'll fix it. With what? We've got nothing left, Bill. We'll be bankrupt, sitting on the curb with the dot-commers. You and I have done that before. We'll go out and we'll get new investors. We'll start over. From scratch... I can't do that again. I'm not in my 20s anymore, man. No kidding. I want the money that we worked for. So do I! Bill, I'm practically broke. I'm scraping by to pay my mortgage, and if we don't get this contract, I'm gonna lose my house. Now, X Corp Reliant, they've made a more-than-generous offer to take us over and I... That's because we have the better design. And they're scared we're gonna beat them out of a contract. But at least you and I would be protected. It wouldn't matter if we got the contract. We'd be set for life. I don't want to sell, especially to X Corp. I know what they did to you before you left. Believe me, I understand. But even if we got the project, we'd be lucky to make payroll before the check comes. I designed a great system. Don't worry, Matthew. You'll see. Money'll start rolling in. Line five. This is it. It is just hitting me that we are the new wave in surgical technology. Our design will help change countless numbers of lives. And we would like to thank each and every one of you for all of your hard work over the past five years. Without you, we never would have gotten this contract. Yeah, you guys stuck with us through some really hard times. And you definitely are gonna see it in your future paychecks. And to think you wanted to sell. Yeah. I knew we'd get it. You didn't tell me. You did it! My boys did it! Congratulations, Matthew. Okay, come with me. Okay, excuse me. Who was that? That was the engineer. It's Michelle. She is so sauced, but don't let that fool you, she's damn good. Come on, jealous girl. Let's dance. ♪ Yes I ♪ ♪ Don't want nobody but you ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ How you feeling? Like death. Champagne'll do that to you every time. Here, drink that. Thanks. Who's that? No idea. He didn't waste any time. Unbelievable. What, did you buy it this morning? I had it reserved just in case. It's gorgeous. For what I paid, it better be. Bill, I'm gonna miss these mornings. Miss 'em? Now that the contracts are done, I'm not gonna need those morning rides anymore to go over details. I've been working on it for so long now, coming here has just become part of my morning routine. I guess I'll just keep coming for the free coffee. Well, if you do, you're gonna have to find another route 'cause Matthew's already talking about moving. Yeah, I mean, things are gonna change. Change is good. I mean, that new car of yours. Yeah, you got that right. Crap... crap. Bill. You have a good time last night? What? Did you have a good time last night? Yeah. Matthew was in rare form. I guess we all were. You know what, let me go prod him along for you. Matthew? God, baby, you scared the... hell out of me. I'm sorry. I just... It's okay. I gotta get going anyway. See you later. Yep, I'll be here. Wait a second, I won't be. I got a game tonight. You really think you're gonna be able to play basketball tonight? Don't know. But at least I can sweat all that crap out that I drank last night. Okay. Do you have something for me? No. God, you're a hottie. I gotta go. Go, you're gonna be late. Don't do it, Sandra, don't... do it. He's not cheating on you and you know it. Okay. So... Trust him. I trust him. He's not cheating on you. You're half my age. That doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother you. But I'm married. So am I. Hello? Hello? We're sorry, the call-return feature cannot be used. The number you are trying to reach... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Jackson Gunn Design. Hey, Kelyn, it's Sandra. Can I talk with Matthew? Sorry, he's not in his office. You know where he is? No idea. He's a popular guy, though. Bill's looking for him, and so is Michelle. Michelle? She's one of our engineers. Would you like to leave him a message? No, that's okay, I'm gonna call him on his cell phone. All right, okay. Hi, sorry you missed me. Please leave a message after the tone and I will call you as soon as I get it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. You should go back to sleep, it's late. It's like a quarter after 1:00 in the morning. I thought your game was at 8:00. It was. But we stopped at B. Bonkers and had some pops and ogled the waitresses. Aw, come on, I'm just kidding. You know there's truth in every jest. Yeah? I'll jest you. Stop, just... I'll jest you, come on. No, please, Matthew. Okay, okay, I give, I give. What is that? What? You got a hickey on your neck. Yeah. I do not have a hickey. I know a hickey when I see one. That's when I went up for that rebound and got knocked. Man, boy, that's gonna hurt in the morning. You'll be happy to know... I scored anyway. Glad you scored. Hey. Give me a kiss. Good morning, good morning. There's some... there's some clean mugs in the cupboard there. All right. So... I hear the Russian ballet is coming to town. Now, I know you've always wanted to see them, so I think we should get tickets. Good tickets. Yeah, yeah, do what you want, yeah. Did I do something wrong? No. It's that time of the month? Okay, I'm sorry, I just... I call a truce. Truce. I gotta go. Okay. Have a wonderful day. I will see you for dinner. I'll be here. Bye. Bye. Matthew, this is Michelle... again. I feel like you're avoiding me. Call me. Why are you wasting your lunch? You can pay someone to do that for you, you know. I want to do it. You like to rub it yourself? Doesn't everyone? Have fun waxing your hot rod. "Waxing your hot rod." Boo! God! Hey, sunshine. Hi. What are you doing here? I just drove up, and I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd come by and say hi. Hey. Yeah. Well, thank you. But I gotta take a conference call. It might not be a good time. Okay. And I'm late. Go, go, go, go. I don't want to keep you. Hey, listen, I'm gonna be at the studio late, so you might wanna pick up dinner for yourself on the way home, okay? Don't be too late. You know I can't sleep without you. Yeah, I bet. Detective Moon will be back any minute. I figured we'd save some time and go over some preliminary information. All right. Sandra... can I call you Sandra? Sure. Sandra, we get people coming in here all the time asking for exactly what you're asking for, and when it's all said and done, most of them would wish that they were right back where they started from. I want to know. Okay. Let me show you some. Do you want to see your husband like this? I just hate to see the looks on their faces when he tells 'em. It's the worst part of the job, it really is. So taking pictures like this, it's not gonna fix what's broken. Only you can do that. So if you really love this guy, at least think about talking to him first. I'm sorry I'm late. That's all right. I've changed my mind. Be with you in a second. You did it again, didn't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Totally forgot. Well, thanks a lot. I'm so sorry. I will make it up to you. You better. Come on, I'll throw something together. You look fabulous. Well, thank you, darling. I thought that being single the second time around was gonna be easier... it's not, it's worse. The men are older and all they want is younger and younger. Jenna, can I ask you something? I'm an open book, honey. How'd you know that Sam was cheating on you? Followed him. I sat in the car outside his office and watched him go to lunch. Lunch that day was the number-five special... at that hotel Ibot. Big boobs, tight ass, 22 and blonde. Yeah, but still, how did you know? I didn't. I think I followed him just to prove myself wrong. Hey, you don't think that... No. Good, because Matthew's one of the good ones. I have learned to hate men, but even I can tell he's a keeper. Yeah, I know. Don't do what I did. What? When I caught Sam cheating, it wasn't the first time I followed him. I'd been doing it for years. It made me feel good to know that he was doing what he said he was doing. Ever since Nicky Mosetti cheated on me with Kim Benedict in the seventh grade, I have checked up on them, every one, and I always caught them cheating. I didn't want to with Sam, though. And I didn't for a long time, but... catching him made me think. Is it really them or is it me? That doesn't make any sense. Marriage is based on trust and I can't trust men. It's something deep down inside. I've tried, but I can't break it. Well, that still does not excuse what they did. No, it doesn't, but I was looking for something that wasn't there. Especially with Sam. I punished him for cheating even though I knew he wasn't, and, well... we both know what a bitch I can be. I can't help but think that things could have been different if I'd actually been able to trust him. We would have had a strong marriage. He wouldn't have had to look somewhere else. So my advice to you... is don't look for trouble when there ain't any. And then again, if he is cheating, I'll help you string him up by his fuzzy little. Surfing for a new husband? Matthew. Um, I want to talk to you about these last few days. I know that I have not been very easy to live with, but... I don't want to talk about that. The last few weeks have been... Well, they've been crazy for both of us. You with your show coming up, and needless to say, I've had other things on my mind. Sometimes the things that really matter in your life, you let 'em fall by the wayside. I know I have. But life won't be like that from now on. Promise? I promise. Go sit down. Close your eyes. Why? 'Cause I have something I want to give to you. So just give it to me. Close 'em. Okay, open. Nothing but the best for my baby. You don't like it? No, it's just, um... It's beautiful. Matthew. I want to know everything. I want to know where he's going. I want to know who he's seeing, and I want to know the bitch he's giving jewelry to. Yeah, sure, I'll track the fellow, take pictures. Go through his phone records. Credit, bank accounts, all that. Pretty much rip apart his life, all without him knowing a thing and guaranteed confidential. So you still have those notes? I threw them out. But they were really plain. They were just white paper. What about the e-mails? Yeah, I deleted those and I've been trying all morning to figure out what that address was. It was "friend" something. It's probably just a broad he's banging, trying to break 'em up so she can... Um, I'm sorry. I just prefer to be blunt in cases like these. I mean, there's no sense beating around the bush, you know? Leave that to the country-club types. Maybe it's best if we got to work on this by ourselves, okay, Sandra? All right. If you get any more e-mails, notes, whatever, save everything, all right? I'll have a tail on him by lunchtime and we should have a pretty good profile in a few days. Okay. Now, what I need you to do, I need you to go about your business as usual. We can't have him know we're watching him. You understand? Yes. Okay. I'll be in touch. Will you be paying by cash or credit? 'Cause I much prefer... Donald. Cash. I'm in position. Looks like the lunch whistle just blew. Be ready. Copy. Hello, Moon. Hey, Charlie. Yes, I need a favor. Full infidelity check. Hotels, frequent numbers. You know, the usual. So I will be back around 2:00. Okay. Thanks, buddy, I owe you one. Listen, you haven't seen an envelope full of pictures lying around, have you? No. I swear I left them in my desk. Maybe they're in the car. I'll see you in a few.Yeah. Looks like he's crossing the street to the no-tell hotel. Well, he's going first class. Something you've never considered. What, the office couch ain't classy enough for you? Whoa. What can I hit for you? Three is fine. Well, that was easy. You want a mint? No, thank you. Hi, are you... Shh! Not in the hall. Yeah. Sorry about that. Okay, we got him. He's in room 312. Get this... he's buying. Lloyd, Moon. I need a room. Whereabouts? West side of the building, third floor. Any particular room number? Something in the 330s should do it. Busy day for the third floor. When do you need it? I'm about ten yards from your door. Just in time for the main event. That-a-girl. Donald. Donald! Not now, Francis. He's leaving the hotel. What the hell are you talking about? Crap! You know what, you just go back to your nap, because I got it. I thought you said 312. I did! Well, then, maybe I wasn't the one napping. Maybe you should think about getting your ass back in your car. Yeah. I love it when you talk dirty. Well, that was a bust. Things are looking up. Get off your dress and find out what they're talking about. I'm working here. How's Thursday after work? Tomorrow at lunch is better. Okay, I'll let you know. All right. Just give me a minute. I don't want to walk in together. That stupid kiss the other night already has people talking. You're really too much. Hi, it's Matthew Gunn. I'd like to leave a message for Xavier Thorgan. No, Xavier told me that he'd be out. Can you please just ask him to call me on my cell when he gets back? Thank you. Your mail just came in. Kind of late, wouldn't you say? Hey, let me see that. It's a bit of a departure for you. You don't like it? No, it's great. I don't know who's pissing you off, but they should do it more often. I'm guessing it's your husband. How come you never painted like that when we broke up? I gotta go. Hey there. Hey. I'm gonna take a shower. You wanna join me? Aw, come on. No, really, I'm not in the mood. I'm not. You're never in the mood anymore, are you? Hey. What are you doing? No, it's all right, he's in the shower. Did you find out anything? Well, let's just say it's been interesting. Nothing concrete, but yeah, I got some leads. Well, he's in for the night, so go home. He won't leave again until about 8:30. All right. Great. Looks like the assembly line's in good shape. Great, let's get going. Hold on, I'll see if they're in. Xavier Thorgan, X Corp Reliant. What the hell does he want? Who knows? Take a message, please. Sure. You know you have to get out more. How else are you gonna get laid? I get laid. Yeah, when? Okay, it's been awhile. Too long. You know, I have the perfect girl for you. Whoops, excuse me. Excuse me! Did you see that? I did. Subtle. Very subtle. It got the job done. Anyway, so I was thinking about Kelyn. Why don't you go out with her? She's too young for me. Come on, she's cute. I know, she's cute, but... My car! My brand-new car! They did this! That's why that bastard called this morning! X Corp did this as a little payback for us getting the contract. First Xavier screws my reputation and now this! We do not know it was them. Who else would it be?! If I ever catch that... So you're not gonna show this one? I don't think it fits with the rest of the pieces. Well, who cares? This is some of the best work you've ever done... and I love the way the colors blend here. I mean, the strokes, those are really powerful. The lines, great lines. Great curves. That's passion. Alex, don't. Does he know how much you like this? I can make you forget about Matthew. I can't do this. Sure you can. This is the part that we're really good at. No, I'm married now. It was a long time ago. I'm a very different person now. I won't do this to him. Yeah. I get it. Thanks, guys. Sorry about your car, Bill. Yeah. No witnesses, no prints. Doesn't look good. That's a nice necklace. Thanks. Kelyn, why don't you grab some lunch with Bill today? He's eating alone. You're not hungry? No, I should finish up a few things here. I'll grab something later. Okay, see you in a bit. See you. Hi, Michelle, it's Matthew. And here we go. So... Let's just skip the small talk and get right to it. A lady that takes control. Nice. So spell it out for me. Well, I was right. It can't be fixed without starting from scratch. It's a coding error in the kernel and we can't isolate it because it's woven too deep into the code. How long until it fails? Actually, it works just fine, but if a specific sequence of commands is given in the right order, the heart console could fail catastrophically. And while the sequences that I'm talking about have like a one-in-a-million shot of actually being plugged in, if it does, it's a major bug and it can't be fixed. But it would be difficult to find, right? Yeah, well, I doubt that they would be able to find it on their own, but we have to tell them that it's there, Matthew. People could die because of this. Yeah, I know. Not quite the getting down to business we're looking for. Have you told the tech department yet? No. I was waiting to see how serious this was first. It's bad, and I told you that three weeks ago. Well, it is still just the two of us that know about this, right, so... Are you saying that Bill doesn't even know yet? I told you that I would wait until we got the contract, but... I'll tell Bill. Just give us some time so we can prepare a press release so we don't bury ourselves, okay? Fine. Okay. Thank you. Xavier Thorgan, please... this is Matthew Gunn. Hey there. Sorry, I know that I said I'd be home for dinner, but I'm tied up with things here at the office. I'll try not to be late, all right? Bye. Mind if I sit down? Sure. You have reached Jackson Gunn Design. Our office is now... Closed. So I have a few problems I need to iron out and that's why I'm sitting here trying to drum up the courage to do what I need to do. Life really isn't that bad. Maybe not for you. No. What I mean is, it doesn't have to be that bad. Not tonight. I'll make you forget about your job. I have a place nearby. She doesn't have to know. I'd know. That's the problem. I'll let you do anything you want to me. Anything. Tiffany, the way you are looking, which is stunning, don't get me wrong, you'll have no trouble having someone find you and take you up on your offer tonight. But I want you. I'm sorry, I said I can't. She's a lucky woman. Depends on the day. He didn't. I heard. You look damn fine, too. If he was fooling around on her, he'd have taken you up on your offer. Yeah, too bad. Looked like a good ride, if you know what I mean. Thanks, darling. Nice doing business with you. You, too. Stay safe, Tiff. I will. Now, I went back five months and I checked every phone call. Office, home, cell. None of it adds up to anything. Credit cards... they check out, too. There's nothing out of the ordinary 'til the jewelry last week. And that jewelry box you asked about? Turns out it was a necklace, but he returned it that same afternoon. Sandra, I've been doing this a long time. Matthew's clean. He's not cheating on you. In fact, I personally heard him tell people how much he loves you. And, hell, even I believed it. You know how much that shocks me with all the crap I've seen? Look, why don't you do yourself a favor? Tell him what's going on. Hey, hey. Whoa. Thanks. Needed that today. What's going on? Hey. Come on, you can tell me. What's going on? Baby? Hey. need to talk. How long has he been following me? A week. Are you kidding me? But he just came by an hour ago and told me that you weren't cheating. Of course he told you that I wasn't cheating, Sandra. I'm not! Why didn't you come to me and talk about this?! I don't know. You instantly assume that I'm just cheating on you? What kind of marriage do we have? Matthew... God, I'm so sorry. Are there any bugs around here listening in? No. What about my office? I don't think so. Well, I have to know, Sandra. I deal with confidential documents all day long. This would kill the entire contract if somebody finds out about this. Are you gonna tell Bill? Hell no, I'm not gonna tell Bill. I'm not gonna tell a soul. But what I do want is anything this Moon guy has recorded or taken pictures of or whatever, and I want it now! She was a hooker. Your wife had nothing to do with that. That was my idea. Nice. Very nice. This one isn't even me. Yeah, sorry. That was a little mixup. Now, is this everything? Yeah. You better not be holding anything back. I know how you guys operate. Mr. Gunn, I might not be in the swankiest line of work, but I'm not out to screw nobody either. This is it. All right. I took out everything that has to do with my business and I left anything that looks like it's related to the notes, e-mails... stuff like that. You've got experience with stuff like this, don't you? Yeah, yeah, of course. Has anybody else touched the note? No, just the two of us. Good. You mind putting that in a bag for me? And I'm gonna need your prints. All right. I meant Sandra. I already got yours. I'll have these analyzed overnight. By tomorrow, we should know if someone else has touched 'em, the make of the paper and the printer they came from. And if you remember the name of the screen name on that e-mail, definitely let me know. We will. You surprised me, Matthew. That takes some doing. Thanks. Yeah. You have a lovely night, Mrs. Gunn. Matthew, I'm so sorry. What kind of wife am I? It's okay, Sandra. I love you. Boy, I am mad as hell at you right now, but I do love you. That's not gonna change. Yeah. Nothing's gonna change that, ever. I love you so much. If I would have got those notes, who knows what I would have thought? Probably the same as you. But I checked out, right? Yes. Yes, you did. That means something, right? Yes. Yes, hi, Francis, this is Sandra Gunn. Those e-mails are back. A little lower. A little lower. Right there is perfect. Hey. This place looks great. Thanks. You know, I can't stop thinking about yesterday. Yeah, let's... let's pretend that didn't happen, okay? You do all these? Moon. Sorry. So what'd you find out about the letters? That paper's about as generic as it comes. The printer's no different. It's an HP, so pretty much every office in America's got one. So we got nothing. You didn't let me finish. I found another print. Whose? That I don't know. But whoever it is doesn't have a criminal record... yet. And what about the e-mails? Still working on it. Okay, so what do we... what do we do? Narrow it down to some likely suspects, grab their prints. Go from there. I got an idea. Can I get you another? Yes, thank you. No problem, Ms... Ray. Jenna Ray. Ms. Jenna Ray. Got it. Remind me never to play waiter again. My feet are killing me. Welcome to my world. Hey. Hey. You look good enough to eat. Thank you. I don't see him. Are you okay? Yeah. So how're we doing? It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Okay, wait, Donald. Wait a second, I wanna get these out before I forget. Amy Soloff, Crystal Remy, Bill Cash. No, wait, hang on a second. No, I don't know those people. Yeah, well, they know you. Whoever's sending you these letters could be some crazy obsessed fan of yours. I mean, do you really think it could be a fan of my work? Sandra, nothing's going to happen to you here. I'll make sure of that. Honey, just go out and enjoy your party. This sort of thing doesn't happen every day, you know. All right. Mr. Moon, how about thinking before you speak? Yeah. Hey. Wow. There you are. That dress is fantastic. Yeah, you like? Yes, I do. Do you? So sweet. Tonight sure looks like a success. We are so happy with the turnout. And what about that other thing? It's going good, going good. Jenna, Jenna! Would you get the cameraman? Boys, we've got to capture this moment. A little bit this way. Okay, okay? Now come on in. Say "Camembert." I like that one. I want to get an extra copy of that one sent to me, okay? You got it. I think I should make a speech. Come with me, guys, come on. Thank you all so much for coming. I hope that everyone is having a good time. Well, first of all, I would just like to thank these wonderful artists who have been gracious enough to share this evening with me. It is your work and your friendship that has made this work space what it is. So please feel free to stay as long as you'd like. Drink up, but most importantly, support these artists and take their wonderful works home with you. Thank you. Enjoy. How was that? Great. Yeah? Now go show off.Okay. Hi. This piece over here. Yes. "Infidelity." It's brilliant... and it's sold. Tell me you have something that's similar. I'm happy to say that that one is one of a kind. Can you put that one upstairs, honey? Thanks. I would have given you that one. What fun would that be? Okay. So we're gonna see you tomorrow night, right? This time I'm buying. We'll see about that. All right, you get home safe. All right. Congrats. Thanks. I'm so glad I don't have to clean up this place. No kidding. Are they still working in there? No, they're just packing up. Moon says they'll start getting results tomorrow sometime. Please take me home. You read my mind. It was a good night. Yeah, it was. I'm late again. Here, take this. One more reason why I love you. Hey, wait a minute. Come here. That's more like it. Yes, it is. All right... wait, have you seen my cell phone? No, but I can't help you look for it now, I have to go. Wait, wait, here, take this to Bill. From last night already. Yeah. I had them deliver it this morning. That was fast. I need it for the press release. Remember, I got that subcontractor review today, so... So I won't see you before midnight. I'm not gonna let it go late. That's what you say every time. I will see you at Toot's Grill by 8:30, I promise. We're meeting at Bill's. That's right. 8:00. See you tonight. Nice work, Jenna. Garage Gallery. Sandra, it's Bill. Hey, did you get your car fixed? If I ever get the authorization from my insurance company. You are still there? Can you believe it? First I got the runaround from the dealer and now this hangup. That sucks. Yeah, tell me about it. I've been running around all day. Anyway, change of plans for tonight. We're meeting at La Fleur. La Fleur? I thought we were going to Toot's. After your show, you deserve a night out to celebrate. Okay, well, I take back what I said about picking up the check. Yeah, like that's a surprise. All right, I'll call Matthew and let him know we changed our plans. No need. It was his idea. I talked to him just before he got sucked into another meeting that I thankfully escaped. And he couldn't get an 8:00. Is 7:00 all right? Yeah, yeah, that'll be fine. I'll see you then, okay? Awesome. Bye. Xavier, I am very happy to hear you've come on board. I was a little concerned that you wouldn't be interested in the price we were asking. X Corp Reliant is always interested in acquiring a quality product. We've been looking at you for a while now. Well, then this deal will work out great for both of us, and we will see you next Friday to sign the papers. Been looking forward to seeing Bill again after all these years. We didn't part under the best of terms. That's water under the bridge. Absolutely. Mind if I don't walk you out? Not a problem, see you Friday. Say hi to your wife. I will. Do I know that guy? Not unless you're into medical technology as a side business. Hey, you, where are you? You're not answering your phone, you're not here. I guess I will see you at Bill's at 8:00, just like I promised. Bye. Why are you here? Did you find something? Yeah. Is your partner here? No, why? I don't know how to tell you this. We got a match on that print. It's his. No way. You must have made a mistake. That e-mail account? It came back registered to a fake name, of course, but to this office's network. So we started matching everybody that worked here against the print. Bill's a 98% match, and that, my friend, is as good as it gets. It's not Bill. How can you be so sure? Well, I've known him for years. Listen to me, Matthew, the print matches. It's him. Sorry I'm late. I was just trying you on your cell. Good luck with that. I can't find it. I know it's in the house somewhere, but I don't know what I did with it. Well, that must be why Matthew can't get ahold of you, either. He just called, said he's running late, but we should go ahead and order. I told him this morning subcon review always goes late. Don't be too hard on him. He saved me from having to be there and it's not like it's fun. I know. Anyway, this will be nice. We haven't had dinner alone in a long time. When was the last time? I remember. It was that horrible seafood restaurant. The Kettle-O-Gumbo. I had raw shrimp and you had the... The grouper with worms. Okay, it's making me sick. Yeah, I'm never gonna live that one down, am I? No. Wine? Sure. Good. Okay, he's not here. I just tried his cell and he's not answering, and neither is Sandra. I told him if we were gonna be late, leave, but I'm five minutes early. I'm just gonna take this opportunity to look around. No, no, no, we can do better, we can do better. What do you got? This is breaking and entering, you know? We didn't break anything. Yeah, but it'll still get us 13 months with good behavior. What are we looking for, anyway? I don't know. But it'll stand out when I see it, believe me. I'm telling you, there's nothing here. What? I just realized who that guy was coming out of your office. Who, Xavier? Yeah. I got pictures of that guy banging some broad in a hotel room. Really? You set that up, didn't you? I... I don't know what you're talking about. Blackmail's a dirty business, my friend. Yeah, yeah. That's what I hear. I wasn't gonna use it. I'm saving that for a rainy day. I thought Bill didn't want to sell the company. He doesn't. You're not as clean-cut as I thought, Mr. Gunn. Not one bit. Yeah, I guess not. Holy crap. No, you're not gonna want to look in there. What? Trust me, he's our guy. No. If you didn't believe me before, Matthew, this has to ice it. He's with Sandra. Okay, we gotta find him now. Let's go. They have reservations at Toot's. Sandra, if you hear this, don't leave the restaurant. If you already have, go to where there's people, lots of people. You go to the restaurant, I'll go to the house. I'll see you there. That was Matthew. Is he done yet? Yeah, yeah. He said that he's sorry about dinner, but that he is going to meet us at my house for drinks. After a subcon review, he's gonna need one. Can I help you, sir? Gunn party, where are they? The Gunn party? Yeah, they had 8:00 reservations. Yes, you did, but no one showed up for the table. Damnit. You want a nightcap? Sure, what do you got? Anything that you desire. Well. You make a great vodka martini. Well, then, one great vodka martini coming up. So you and Matthew are finally gonna have your own office space. That should be nice? I don't know. I kind of like sharing the office. I think I'm gonna miss it, really. Here, shake this up. Got it. Fancy. Show-off. I'm gonna repaint this place. Yeah? Yeah. At least the bedroom. What are you thinking? I don't know. Got any ideas? No idea... let me go check it out. Forever the bachelor. So what do you think? You haven't seen it yet, have you? What's wrong? Let me see that. How could you? What are you talking about? I've seen your bedroom! Wait, Matthew, what is going on? I trusted you! Matthew, stop it! Stop it, Matthew! There's a gun! Matthew... My God! It's okay, it's okay. Baby, Sandra, look at me, it's okay. You're okay. Baby, listen to me. I have to call the police, okay? I will be right back. Stay here. Yes, hello? Someone's been shot. I think I killed him. No, please, just send somebody. Just send somebody fast. No, this is not my house. Yes, yes, that's the address. Yes, fast, fast. All right. My God! I don't want you to see this. Come on, come on. No, no, no, no. I can't believe it. Come on, it's okay. Pretty cut-and-dry, Joe. When they're done grilling him, let Homicide know I'll bring everything I got down to the station. Fill in the holes for 'em. She didn't see it coming. No, none of us did. The guy was sick. Pure and simple. Yeah. No. Like I said before... I tried, but she... she didn't have her cell phone. What I'm unclear on is where the gun came from. We fell onto the table... then it was just there. I... I didn't even know he owned a gun. Well, do you own a gun? God, no. Did you know that one of your employees was reported missing this afternoon? Who? Michelle, Michelle Jablonski. What are you saying? She's dead. Shot twice in the chest. We're not gonna hear from Ballistics for the next few days, but the wound caliber, it was an exact match. You think Bill did that? Well, what do you think? After tonight, Detective, I don't know what the hell to think. Did you happen to... Listen, please, detectives, I've already told you at least three times what happened, okay? I would just like to please take my wife home. Okay, but you're not gonna be going anywhere tomorrow, are you, Mr. Gunn? No. Good. We'll be stopping by your house to take formal statements. Okay, that'll be fine. All right, you can go. All right, thank you. Let's go home. Now I know why you didn't answer your cell phone. Where'd you find it? It was in the office. It must have fallen out of the charger. I swear I looked there. Here, this'll help. No, I don't want those. I think that it might relax you. I think it'll help you forget. Okay, maybe later. All right. Okay, come on, come on. What? Sit down, I'll brush your hair. No. Matthew, please, don't. It's just so weird. I understand. The brushing was nice. Good. Did Bill go to the office today? Did Bill go to the office today? No, he was dealing with his car. Matthew, please tell me, was it you, please? What are you talking about? Finding the picture from last night, how did Bill get it if he didn't go to the office? How the hell could you? Sandra, I... Hey, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? What are you doing? Please, Sandra. Hey, you have to let me explain. Come here. Come on. Sandra, Sandra. No, no, hey, hey. Stop it, stop it. No, no, no. Sandra. Come on. Sandra. Sandra, just give me a chance. Sandra, open this door now. No, no, no, give me that. No, no! Give me that! Get away from me! Give me that! Get off of me! You stop it! Stop it, okay? I had to or we would have lost everything. What are you talking about? What do you mean? There's a problem with the software in the heart console. What? And if it gets out, it will destroy us. They will void our contract and we will end up with nothing. If we sell the technology as is, we'll earn our payday and X Corp gets stuck with the problems. Don't you see? No. I had to do something before it was too late, Sandra. We were gonna lose everything. The company, the house. So losing this prestigious 24 "abbott," that drove you to kill your best friend! I had to. Bill wouldn't even talk about selling. If we kept ownership, he would have told them about the problems. He was too honest. He would've let us all go down with the ship. I couldn't let that happen. God. Just listen to me. Sandra, please, would you just listen to me? All you have to do is tell them exactly what you saw tonight and we will be all right. You don't have to lie. It is so easy. Then we'll have it all. It's perfect. Baby, he was infatuated with you. He stole those pictures off my desk. He sent those e-mails from our office. He kept calling you and then hanging up. He sent those letters. You sent those letters. They don't know about that. Moon will say that it was Bill. I played him perfectly. He's a perfect alibi, baby. All his evidence proves that it was Bill. Hell, his prints were all over the letter. Baby, I just want to grow old and gray with you. Matthew. And if you help me, we can have everything that we ever dreamed about. Matthew, you still think that we can? Absolutely. We'll be together. That's all I want. What do I have to do? You don't have to lie about anything. You've got to tell me everything that you did. And make sure that you didn't make... any more mistakes. I went to Bill's and set up the shrine during lunch. Then Moon came to the office looking for Bill. He followed the clues right to him. And then we went to the house and found the shrine just like I planned. So you had the gun. I planted it. But the police will never know about that. And all the letters and all the phone calls, that was just you setting him up so you could kill him and get away with it. Don't you see? All the evidence points directly at Bill. You don't have to lie. You just gotta tell the police exactly what you saw happen. We're gonna be fine. What about the heart monitor? Does anybody else know about the heart monitor? Not anymore. I love you, Sandra. Hey. I only did this so we could have the life that we talked about. Do you remember 12th Street? I remember us working two jobs just to pay for that dump. I remember laying in bed and watching TV. We had no furniture. I'd lay in your arms and we'd talk until I fell asleep. And the garbage truck would wake us up at 6:00 a.m. Making love was a morning ritual. But we never went out to eat. We never owned anything nice. I was so happy when we finally could move. I loved that place. I hope by next week, we can buy it. Baby, we're gonna have so much money. It's okay, it's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay, you'll see. This way, come on! Clear here! Put your hands where I can see them! Back away, Miss. Are you all right? Yeah. Did he hurt you? No, he wouldn't hurt me. Put your hands on your head.
