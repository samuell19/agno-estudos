Yeehaw! Yeehaw! Drive 'em up ahead, Sam. Land's sakes, must he drive so fast? We'll all be killed. We've got to get to Deadwood Crossing in time for the big anniversary celebration, ma'am. You'll be a nice little grown up once you sit still. Hey Sam, grab them ribbons and let'em take us into Deadwood the best way they knows how. -Yahoo, yeah! -Yeah, Sam! Yee-hoo! I don't believe I ever saw you 'round the Gulch before, ma'am. This is my first trip there. I'm going to open an emporium for ladies. -(LAUGHS). -What's so funny? Well, there ain't 50 ladies in the whole town, ma'am. Even the ones that are there ain't exactly, uh, ladies. Hey uh, what's your name, anyhow? Emma Stokes. Miss Emma Stokes. I'm glad to meet up with ya, Miss. My friends call me Colorado Charlie. You know, you'd do better if you was opening up a store to sell vittles. Hundred pounds of flour bring 60 bucks. Eggs are four dollars a dozen. Don't exactly have to be exactly too fresh, either. (LAUGHS) Hmm, women would rather have calico. Food? Hmm, be a nice girl now, Patsy. I reckon you're about right, Miss. Females do most anything to look pretty. That's why I went all the way to Fort Laramie to get -this anniversary present for Calam. -Calam? -You mean Calamity Jane? -Who else could I mean? -Do you know her? -Know her? Work for her, help her run the Prairie Queen dance hall... I've heard so much about Calamity Jane. They say no man in the west can stand up to -her in a gun fight. -Correct, Miss. You arriving at a good time, too. Big celebration going on. But... I forgot. You a stranger in these parts. -Today is August the 2nd. -So it is. -You don't know what happened in the Gulch one year ago. -No. Well, you'll find out. First anniversary? -No. -Is it a wedding celebration? No. A killing celebration. How's that, Colorado? -40 minutes ahead of schedule. -You could have made it 41. Come on out, Emma. This is as far as we go. I'm lucky to be alive. I never had such a ride. Sorry, Ma'am. But we had to be back in time for the celebrations. Celebration? I don't see anything happening. Everybody's over at Calam's place. She's throwing the party. Free drinks all in his memory. Well, I never. Hmm! (LAUGHS) -When you get unhitched, boys, come on over. -Sure thing, Colorado. You're welcome to the free drinks, mister. But we don't allow no cheating in the Prairie Queen. Colorado, you old side-winder! Welcome home! Dadgum it, don't be so glad to see me, you'll get Calam's anniversary gift all crushed up. Don't do it. -Present for Calam? Whatcha get her? -None of your business. How's the celebration coming along? Pretty good. I broke four of these so far. He's always butting in on my work. Uh, I gotta find Calam and give her this package. She ain't inside. -I got an idea of where she at. -You have, huh? Yeah, you folks get on inside and keep the celebration going. -I'll bring her back. -You will, huh? Well, I see you're back, Colorado. No, I'm still in Fort Laramie. I got some important business I'd like to talk over with your boss. -Yeah? -Where is she? That comes under the head of her business. But if it's anything concerning Calam, you can talk it over with me. I want her to get it first hand. Go get her. That's what I was aiming to do. But not because you told me to. Howdy, Calam. Hello Colorado. I bring you a present from Fort Laramie. He's been dead a year today. Such a fine gentleman he was, Colorado. I never loved another man. Look at the present I brung ya. Here it is, Calam. The finest that could be bought in Fort Laramie. Colorado... You didn't have to go through all that trouble. Won't find nothing like 'em in Deadwood. Copper riveted and everything. (SOBBING) There now, little partner. Don't take on like that. I know just how you feel. Wild Bill was one of my closest friends, too. But we oughta be back downtown. Everybody's asking about ya. You know, you threw this celebration just so folks wouldn't be forgetting him. I don't wanna go to any celebration. Well, I hate to tell you this, Calam, but Matt Baker and his killers wanna have a talk with ya. -Matt Baker? -Yeah. -I told him he could talk to me but he said... -Let's go. I don't wanna keep Mr. Baker waiting. Tell Matt I'll see him in my office. And I can't hardly wait. Take it easy, boys. Mr. Baker's just here on business. Howdy Calam. Your celebration is a big success. You didn't come here to compliment me. -What's on your mind? -I heard you were serving free drinks. I hate to ask you to talk business on a day like this. -I know how you felt about Wild Bill, but I... -You didn't come here to talk about that either. I'll make you one last offer to sell out. We told you once before we wasn't interested. I made a trip to San Antone last month. Ran into someone there that you oughta know. I don't know a lot of people in Texas. You ever hear of Cecelia Mullen? -What about her? -Had a talk with her after she found out I knew uncle Frank. She's on her way to Deadwood. Glad to see her, won't we be? Yeah, sure will. Miss Mullen is the niece of Frank Mullen. His only living blood relation. She will claim this property. No gunplay, Calam. I'm not armed. Besides you got me all wrong. I came here to help. You're a liar. You went to Texas to find that gal. And fixed it all up with her to come here and claim this property, didn't you? My straight games downstairs are knocking your crooked ones out of business. And you can't stand that, Matt Baker. So you cooked up this little deal to come back here and take the Prairie Queen away from me. Well, it won't work. I'll stand behind Calam and everything. Frank Mullen told Calam she could have this clean when he passed on. She saved his life when a band of Sioux ambushed him. You ain't got the nerve enough to shoot it up with me. -You gotta cook up a scheme like this. -I accidentally ran into Miss Mullen and she told me what she intended to do. I bet. It's not my fault, Calam. -The law's the law. -What's the law got to do with it? Miss Mullen hired a lawyer. -A lawyer? -Yes and he's on his way to Deadwood. I'll shoot it out with him, too. You can't do that, Calam. Law and order is coming to the Gulch. In a week or so we'll have a real United States judge here. Ask Sheriff Atwood if you don't believe me. Great jumpin' horny toads, what's this town coming to, anyway? Soon be where a man can't settle an argument in his own way. Deadwood's growing up, the town's getting prosperous. We haven't had any trouble with the Indians in almost a year. Gold is drawing in new citizens every day. Yeah, I can just see the buttons on your vest busting off with civic pride. Now if you had some papers to prove what you say, Calam, you'd stand a better chance. This lawyer I talked to is a smart one. Told me his client had a just claim on the property of her deceased uncle. So you know the lawyer, too. -Yes, his name is Hastings. -Hastings? Yes, Gordon Hastings. How long do I have to think this over? -Oh, about... -I mean, before the lawyer gets here. Oh, couple of days. -You made me the last offer to sell out, didn't you? -Well, yes, that's right. Suppose you own the Prairie Queen. Won't the niece and the lawyer try and take it away from you? No they wouldn't. I'd give them a good price for it. So will I. If I have to. You couldn't buy it from her, Calam, because she doesn't like you and your kind. Get out. Alright, if that's the way you want it. Oh, I'm sorry Calam, but I forgot to wish you a happy anniversary. (GLASS BREAKING) They can't do this to you, Calam. We'll shoot it out with them. We can't fight the whole United States government. If we only had some written proof of what old Frank said. That's simple enough. We'll write some proof. -You can't do that. -Then what in tarnation are you going to do? Just walk out and hand the place over to some strange female? We ain't licked yet. -I knew you'd see it my way, Calam. -Put your gun away. I got a better idea. -You have? -Meantime... We ain't finished celebrating Wild Bill's anniversary. Why, no! -We're celebration bound! Yeehoo! -Yippee! Yippee! Woohoo! -Everybody having a good time? -What a grand way for you to show your undying love for Wild Bill Hickock, Calam. I'm so happy for ya. He was a fine gentleman. Thanks Mabel, he sure was. I wish I'd known a man like him. Get along with ya, Mabel. We've all got to help Calam to celebrate. Oh, Miss Calam. I've arranged a little music to help you celebrate. -You mean Marble Halls? -You just wait. Henry! (PIANO AND WHISTLE) (APPLAUSE) (GUNSHOTS) Reach for the sky! Nevermind the strong box. I want to take a look at your passengers. You passengers in there. Come on. Get out. Which one of you is a lawyer? I'm a lawyer, what do you want? What's your name, mister? Hastings. Gordon Hastings. Ok, mister lawyer. I reckon you're the one we're looking for, all right. -Throw down that gent's bag. -Yes sir. The rest of you get back in that coach and high ball it on out of here. (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMING) Pick up your bag, mister. Now get on that horse. Hey, you'll get hurt. Get on this side, you dang city dude. Maybe we oughta make him walk. Alright, mister lawyer. Head for that high peak over yonder and just walk that critter. Don't be in too big a hurry. Don't move. -A woman? -That don't mean I can't shoot this, direct kinda. You must be Calamity Jane. We got business to talk over. You're scheming with that crook Baker and Old Frank's niece to take the Prairie Queen away from me. I was engaged by Miss Mullen to represent her in this legal matter. As for Mr. Baker, I know nothing of his character. Oh, you admit that you know him. Why yes, he was in San Antonio. And you're going right back there. That's ridiculous. If you keep me from reaching Deadwood, Miss Mullen will hire another lawyer. -And maybe I might cause you... -Shut up. Get on your horse. Reach, mister. I'm sorry, Colorado. He tricked me. Get over there by your partner. Now I know you're in with Matt Baker, you city crook. We'll see about that. Lead the way to Deadwood. Don't turn Colorado over to the law. -This is my fight. -No it ain't. I'm seeing this through with you. -Let's get started. -Hold on. I want a little more information about this case. Quiet Colorado. He's looking for something to use against us. We're not as loco as you think we are, Mr. Hastings. I heard tell that lawyers get a lot of education, but folks around here have a lot of horse sense, too. In Texas we believe in fair play. You and your partner must be pretty sure of your case or you wouldn't have tried this kidnap game. What are you driving at? It's all right. Take your shooting iron. Well, what do you know? I don't understand, what are you going to do? I'm going into Deadwood to do a little investigating. First I want to talk to Mr. Baker and then to Miss Mullen when she arrives. If there's any truth to your story, I'll see that a fair compromise is made. Say uh... How much you getting to handle this case? Five hundred dollars. I'll make it a thousand. From here on out you're my lawyer. Oh, I couldn't do that. (LAUGHS) I'll have to handle this my own way. Well, I'll be a bow-legged coyote. Ain't this something? From now on Mr. Lawyerman, you do the legal thinkin' and we'll do the legal shootin'. Let's get going. Better walk the rest of the way, Hastings. Looks like there's gonna be trouble. -I'm staying with you. -Now you're talking. -Howdy Hastings. -Hello Baker. Is this the gent the road agents took off the stage? -Yep, that's him. -It is, huh? What do you have to say about this, young fella? He doesn't have anything to say, Sheriff. Arrest Calam and Colorado. It's plain as day they held up the stage. Do you think so, huh? This ain't your play anymore. -He's working for me now. -Strikes me that you're taking a lot of interest in affairs -of the law. -This matter is none of your business. It's my business when a lawyer I hire sells out on me. The gent ain't armed, Baker. -Besides, he ain't a gunslinger. -Now look here, Baker... Oh, let 'em fight it out, Sheriff. -Duke it out, huh? -Sure. Tell ya what to do, Sheriff, go on over to the office and rest. I'll call ya if things get rough. -You will, huh? -Oh yeah. (CHEERING) Atta boy, go! (GUNSHOT) Reckon he's had enough, Gordon. -Come to my place. -You can't get away with this, Calam. You better drop that gun while you got a chance. Come inside and get it. Hold it Baker. Get back to your own place. Fun's about over. I'll settle this with Calam later. -You will, huh? -All right boys, pick him up. Have Dr. Keeper look at that arm. Don't you think one of us should go with him? Nah. Anybody that's stupid enough to get on a porch to ambush a man oughta die of lead poisoning. Shut up, Dave. Go on and beat it. Well, what are we gonna do? Your smart lawyer from Texas walked out on you. Get inside. And don't act like a school boy, Dave. You'll get your chance to even up with that Texan but not until I tell ya. Go on now and beat it. In a fight like this you either need good gunmen or good legal representation. Are you doing the thinking now? I was just trying to help. You forgot there's one other person interested in this case and she'll do exactly -as I say. -Mmmhmm. -Welcome to Deadwood Gulch, Miss Mullen. -Nice to see you again, -Mr. Baker. -Boys, this is Cecelia. Frank Mullen's niece. Mr. Carter, Mr. Dade, and Carlos. Did you have a nice trip from San Antone? Quite comfortable. And fast. Only took 28 days. Where's Gordon? -Why, there's been a slight change in our plans. -What is it? Surely you want to freshen up after your long trip? We'll talk about him later. -Has anything happened to Gordon? -We better not discuss that here. Come on, I'll take you over to your hotel. Oh, let me take that Miss Mullen. -Stage just came in. -It did, huh? Yes and I bet that pretty young lady who got off is Miss Mullen. It was, huh? Yes, and she's gonna try to take the Prairie Queen from Calamity Jane. -She is, huh? -Yes, if you ask me... I don't know which one of them is right. Land's sakes, seems a body could keep something that was given to her. And on the other hand, I suppose a blood relation has a right to take what's rightfully hers. -I would if it was me! -You would, huh? (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) Howdy Sheriff. -Nice morning. -It is, huh? What don't you stop bothering with that cap and ball gun? Get you one of them new Colts. It was good enough for Wild Bill, it's good enough for me. Somehow when I hold this gun I can still feel the warmth of his fingers on the grip. You can, huh? I reckon had Bill had a chance to use it in that last poker game he'd uh... Hey Sheriff, why'd you come out here anyhow? Uh? Oh, I wanna talk with Mr. Hastings. Why don't you try to settle your differences with Matt Baker before that new United States judge gets in town. I don't think we can decide anything until Miss Cecelia arrives. You mean the niece. She's here. Just seen her get off the stage. Well, that's fine. We'll have a meeting today after I talk to her. You will, huh? See you in about an hour. Why do you wanna talk to her for? You're my lawyer, ain't ya? Of course I am, but I must talk to Cecelia. Can't you wait 'til you see her at the meeting? -Why not now? -When you see her you'll have to talk to Matt Baker, too. Better have some more shooting lessons. (GUNSHOTS) Nice shootin', Gordon. Couldn't have done better myself. Do you think I'll be safe talking to Mr. Baker? I reckon. You won't have to be worrying none about him, Calam. He can take care of himself with all of Matt Baker's gunslingers. I wasn't worrying about the gunslingers getting him. Well then what in tarnation are you worried about? Women are sure funny. Hello Cecelia. -How do you do, Mr. Hastings? -I must talk to you. Really? There's nothing to discuss. I know how you feel. Mr. Baker must have told you. But you've got to here Calam's side of the story. -Oh, so it's Calam, is it? -Oh please, can't we talk sensibly? I'm afraid we were misinformed when Mr. Baker was in San Antonio. -Why? -Well, he said that Calam... Miss Jane just moved onto the place and took possession of it. -Well, didn't she? -Not exactly, Cecelia. You see, she knew your uncle very well. -Go on. -It's a well known fact that she saved his life. Colorado Charlie swears that your uncle wanted Miss Jane to have the place if anything happened to him. And of course you believe every word from a character like that. -I'm inclined to take stock in their story. -Very interesting. Before Mr. Baker came to Texas you never gave Deadwood a thought. Perhaps not. Gordon... -I did this for you. -For me? -I don't understand. -You were fresh out of law school. I wanted you to make a name for yourself. I don't need the place. It offered the opportunity for you to start your career with recognition. If I had known that I would never have accepted your case. Well Gordon. Now you know. I'll sell the saloon to Mr. Baker. And we'll return to San Antonio. I believe Calam has a just claim. No matter. I still went into this to help you. I'd rather not be helped that way. I know that you exchanged letters with your uncle. I'll ask you to present them at the meeting. -Of course, Gordon. -Thank you. -You think so, huh? -Yes, Sheriff. If you glance at those letters I'm sure you'll find that the deceased uncle, Frank Mullen wrote to his niece informing her of his intentions of giving Calamity Jane this property. -He did, huh? -Yes, sir. Well, he don't say nothing about it in any of this writing. Are these all the letters you received from your uncle? Yes Gordon. I mean, Mr. Hastings. Is, uh, that all, Gordon? Oh, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting we're such good friends. This case has kinda got me to thinking. Miss Calam and Mr. Colorado have both sworn to oath the deceased wanted her to have the place. And then we have to consider the claim of Miss Mullen. Her being a blood relation gives her certain rights. Anymore questions, Mr. Lawyer? Yes sir, I have one more. You have, huh? Go ahead. You knew that I would ask you to present those letters as evidence, didn't you? Why... Mr. Hastings are you implying that I would hide some of the letters? I didn't say that Miss Cecelia but that's exactly what I meant. Of all the insults... I demand an apology. He ain't got nothing to apologize for. Yeah, cause he caught you lying. -Oh, I'd never been treated like this. -Order! Order. (SOBBING) Well, it's getting kind of late. And I'm tired. We'll continue this meeting when that new United States judge gets here next week. -I'm sorry, but I'd like more time to present new evidence. -You would, huh? Suits me. Let your customers in, Calam. And before we reopen this case... I hope none of you tries any gunplay. Fact is... You better not. I wanna talk to you. I'm sorry Calam. I didn't do your cause much good. You should have another lawyer. Oh, you did the best you could, Gordon. You know... I've been crowding in a lot of thinking. I got an idea that, well, if if you weren't on my side you and that gal would get hitched. You and her could be happy. As far as the Prairie Queen, well... Me and Colorado can start all over again. We won a gold claim over on the crick. We could work that. Mary Jane Canary, you're a poor liar. What's that? You're barking up the wrong tree. I'm not in love with Cecelia Mullen. I admit I ain't much at love matters, but... Well, nobody can say Calamity Jane ever gave a friend a bad deal. How about us going to the dance together? -Me? -Sure. Anything wrong with that? Course not. Aw, shucks. I ain't no good at dancing. The ladies will laugh at me. And at you, too, for bringing me. No excuses. Now you get dressed up nice and pretty. I'll see you later. (GUNSHOTS) Hey! (GUNSHOT) -Who is it? -I don't know. -I'll draw him out. -Calam, come back here! Calam! Come out with your hands raised. Take it easy, Calam. -Didn't see who it was, did you? -No, didn't see anybody. -Is it bad? -No. I've had flea bites worse than this. We better get you to a doctor. -Oh shucks, I'm alright. -No you're not. Here let me get a hold of you. Careful of that bad arm now. Alright, go on about your business, folks. Dadgum varmints. I'll get at 'em. No, this is my fault Colorado. They were gunning for me. She had to get it. Here's your gun, Calam. They wasn't man enough to fight it out in the open. -Does your arm hurt much? -Hmm? Oh no, not much. This had to happen just when we planned to go to that party. Well, I don't dance on my hands, do I? Here Colorado, you take her upstairs and dress that wound. Come with me, Sheriff. Steady now, Calam. Don't you fret. Old Colorado will get you upstairs. (LAUGHTER) Well, you daughter of a four legged squirrel! Are you coming up here? I'll pass. I suppose you're all hard of hearing. No we're not hard of hearing. You don't have to shout. We don't huh? Did none of you hear them gun shots? If I investigated every shot in Deadwood I'd be running around all day and night. -Where's your other gunslinger? -Who? Dave? He rode over to Sheraton. Did he leave town before the shots were fired or right after? Here he is now, ask him yourself. You been in Sheraton, Dave? -Yeah. -You was, huh? Been out of town all day. Say, what is this? Can't a fellow leave the Gulch for a spell? Mr. Carter is an expert horseman, Sheriff. I wish I could ride a horse all the way from Sheraton and keep him as dry as this one. What are you trying to say? That I don't believe you were out of town at all. Only I can't prove it. Alright Texan, you win for now. Put your gun away, Mr. Hastings. And neither one of you go for your guns. Keep civil tongues in your head. Understand? Dave. What did I tell you about acting like a school boy? I got a score to settle with that chap. Well don't try to settle it in broad daylight, you fool. Oh, I'd have got him, if Calam hadn't butted in. I'll tell you when. Give me three. I was just thinking... When did you start that? Are you sure of the girl? -Well yes, why? -I didn't like the way she looked at him at the hearing. You know, Matt, a woman in love... Miss Cecelia... -I just saw you talking to Hastings. -Yes. -What he say? -Told me someone tried to kill him and Calamity Jane was wounded. -Do you know anything about it? -Of course not. Remember Miss Mullen, we have a bargain. I haven't forgotten it. The price that I'm paying you for the place is like finding so much money. And I had no idea of losing the man I love. Don't worry about that. I still get the Prairie Queen? -And I get Gordon Hastings. -Why certainly. Then see that nothing happens to him. I'll guard his life with yours. Uh, pardon me, ma'am, but could I have the pleasure of the next dance with you? I said pardon me, ma'am, but could I have the pleasure of the next dance with you? What in tarnation's the matter? Can't you hear me? I ain't gonna jump out of my skin the first time you ask me. -I'm a lady. -Ohhh... Don't I already know that? Well? -Yeah, well...what? -Help me up! Oh, good evening, Mrs. Kelly. Pretty music, ain't it? Pardon me but Mrs. Kelly tripped me. (KNOCKING) Come in. How's the arm? Oh fine, just a scratch. (MUMBLING) What's the matter with him? Matter? Plenty is the matter. Calam has gone plumb loco . -Fancy manners and using cologne water... -Oh quiet, Colorado. I'm looking for Herbert. Miss Stokes wanted me to remind him to get the musicians for the dance. Him and Elmer's having a little pastime out in the back. You uh... -Haven't changed your mind about the dance, have you? -Sure haven't. -Howdy Miss Calam. -Hello. Thought you two weren't supposed to roll dice on the street? -Dice, why Miss Calam... -Which one of you has 'em? I was rolling. 50 dollars a bet. My point's eight. 50 more says you can make it, Herbert. I don't know. What do you think, Raven? Yes, huh. Well, here's 50 more says you can't do it. Here's my 50 says you can. There she is. Try to break us, Herbert, if you can. -Five. -You'll have to do better than that, Herbert. Eight. Horse, do you belong to him or me? -(LAUGHTER) -Thanks Raven. You're going to have to learn that horse to talk better. (LAUGHS) She said yes. She meant Herbert could make it. Oh wait a minute, Elmer. I want to thank Raven. Thank you. What about it, Rollo? Are we welcome? Bar's closed. Calam wants the nice folks in town to enjoy themselves. Thank you Rollo, we will. Get your paws off that. Ain't you got no manners? What are you doing here? -I was invited. -You was, huh? Yes I was huh. Well just see that you don't start no ruckus. I bet you don't have inventions like this in Texas, Miss Cecelia. Not quite. I doubt we have anyone that can make better cakes than Miss Stokes. Land's sakes, it ain't nothing. Guess it just tastes better 'cause that machine keeps the flies off it. No telling what they'll think of next. Now if someone could only invent something to do the cooking and and washing and ironing for us women folks, what a life that would be. Well, when that happens, Emma, we won't need no more females around. Land's sakes, Colorado, how you talk. Hello Gordon. I ain't seen her yet but just you wait. Listen folks. Guess there's no use keeping you waiting any longer. Come and get 'er. But someone's gonna have to eat with forks. There ain't enough knives to go around. You're beautiful, Calam. Thanks Gordon. My boots are about to kill me. Come on outside and sit down. You know something, Calam? You should never wear men's clothes again. They're a darn sight easier to get in and out of. You'd get used to it. Yeah, well, Bill told me the same thing. Dressed up for him once, too. Looked at me just like you did. He said, "Calam, "you oughta wear womenfolk's things more often." I just couldn't do it. I wanted to please Wild Bill but... Aw shucks, I couldn't help him in a gun fight with all these -frills hanging on me, could I? -I suppose not. But there are lots of other ways a woman can help a man besides helping him in a gun fight. I remember Ma saying something like that. Pa was a preacher. I often wondered what a woman like her would done if she had teamed up with a man like Wild Bill. -Do what every other woman in love would do. -Yeah. I reckon she would, alright. I've been thinking about us. So was I. I mean... What were ya thinking? I haven't made much of a name for myself yet. -It doesn't look as though we're gonna win your case. -Oh hang the case. Go on. I could make a pretty good living in San Antonio. I-I... Well a young lawyer just getting started doesn't make much money but... Hey Calam. Where are ya? If I had my guns I'd plug him! If I had mine I'd let you use it. I've been looking all over for you two. Come on inside. They're fixing to start the music. Hey. What are you doing with your shoe off? Oh shut up. -May I have the first dance, Calam? -All right. Thanks partner. Thanks partner? I wonder what put them two on edge? (APPLAUSE) Thanks for rescuing me. -You're welcome. I, uh... -What is it? I believe in being business-like, and I want you to sign some papers binding our deal. I'll handle this my own way. You're giving me power of attorney and a bill of sale for this place tomorrow. I'll see you in the morning. Oh Cecelia. -Yes? -I was lookin' for ya. I've been thinking... Calam can't win so I think in all fairness you ought to give her a chance to pay your price for the saloon. Does losing this case hurt you very much, Gordon? Will you return to San Antonio, win or lose? I told you it was impossible to win but I'm going back to Texas. Maybe you won't have too much to worry about. (KNOCKING) Who is it? It's Matt Baker. I forgot to tell you something. Open the door. It is tomorrow morning. I decided not to wait. If you're smart, you'll keep your mouth shut. -Uh huh, just as I thought. -I was gonna destroy them. I once heard a fella say that women are unpredictable. Especially one that is crazy enough to fall in love with a man who doesn't love her. We'll transact our legal business right now. (KNOCKING) Miss Mullen? (KNOCKING) (GROANING) Miss Mullen? Miss Mullen? (GRUNTING) -Who did this to you? -Uh, Matt Baker. Thought you and he were good friends? I'm sorry Calam. I got things all jumbled up. Get me out of this, will ya? -I wanna talk to the Sheriff. -In due time. -We'll talk first. -Yes. Maybe you're convinced now that you're playing your cards wrong. Baker is a dangerous man. Yes, yes. I'll do anything you say. -He threatened my life. -Take it easy. I was gonna make a bargain with you. I was gonna say you take the Prairie Queen and I'll take Gordon... Funny ain't it? I was gonna make you the same offer, except, switch the ownership. I had more letters from my uncle. I was gonna give them to Gordon this morning. You... You definitely would get the property but Mr. Baker... (SOBBING) There, there. Don't cry. -Where's Matt Baker? -Ain't you seen him? He went over to your place. -Where's Baker? -He's upstairs in your office with Mr. Hastings. That's all, George. Mr. Baker has some very interesting papers. Yeah, I know. Power of attorney signed by Miss Cecelia Mullen. And a bill of sale for my place at a steal of a price. Now look, Calam, you're late. I'll give you a thousand dollars to walk out peaceably. Maybe you'll do some walking out of town when that gal talks to the Sheriff. You took some letters from Miss Mullen and I aim to get 'em. -What letters? -Letters Old Frank wrote to his niece telling her he was going to give me the Prairie Queen. Hand them over, Baker. (GUNSHOT) Drop it! You've got the gun. Go on and shoot me. You've had this coming for a long time. (PIANO NOTES PLAYED) That's as clean as a musical knock out as I ever seen. Get the letters. Reach. Get Matt. You got any last messages before I leave? -You alright, Calam? -Sure, how's your passengers? Them? Huh. I can't figure out which one's ready for the coroner and which one's ready for jail. -Did you get the letters Gordon? -I got 'em. All aboard that's going to Laramie. I wanted to say goodbye to Calam. But you can tell her for me that I think she's the grandest person I know. Yes ma'am. You see, Calam ain't much of a hand to say goodbye to folks she likes. I gotta do it for her. Aw shucks, you hadn't oughta done that Miss Cecelia. Give it to Calam. From me. -She made us realize we are in love. -Yes ma'am. Goodbye Mr. Hastings. So long, Colorado. You old gunslinger. -It's been nice knowing ya. -Don't you go getting all sentimental-like. Calam wants you to head on back down to San Antone and make yourself and Miss Cecelia happy. -She's a grand lady. -You know something? Calam's a grand lady, too. I'll tell her you said that, Mr. Hastings. It'll make her happy. All aboard that's getting aboard. Hiya! -Howdy Colorado. -Howdy Sheriff. Well, I reckon everything is settled. Calam can keep the Prairie Queen. I'll see that United States judge gives her a legal claim as soon as he gets here. You will, huh? -Have they gone? -Yup. And left a couple messages for you, Calam. Hastings said you sure are a fine lady. -What else? -Well... -Uh... -What is it? Miss Cecelia said that uh... Give ya this! Doggone it, I done it. Didn't get the messages mixed up, did ya? I hope not. Well... I reckon I ain't loved anyone else but him, anyway. Pard, we'll meet again in the happy hunting grounds. I sure hope there's plenty of room up above, Calam. 'Cause when you and Wild Bill get together again, there's gonna be some tall shooting. When I die, Colorado... I wanna be buried right here. Beside him. Calam's wish was granted. Her friends buried her beside him. Calam died in Deadwood 27 years later. On the same day of the month Wild Bill was killed. August the second.
