Are you filming? Alright, I didn't know you could do that, I got the phone from my Uncle from Qatar and everything was in Arabic. He's loaded, but never actually sends us anything... My mum wants me to sell it, and I'm like, I just need it to text and that's it. Don't! - Say it. - What? What you want. I'm Jasna and... I have a big house with a pool and... a villa, and you can get there by bus... What you want from me? What do you mean what do I want? Why are you here? Well, you told me to come. Why are you fuckin' messing with me, I don't like that. And what do you like? I like to take it. What the fuck do you mean, what I like? - How do you like to take it? - Like this. You like to ride? Well, yes, but sometimes my tits shake, and then I don't like it. Show them to me. What, you want to show me that you've got a nice bra? You like this? What do you want? - Fuck me. - What did you say? Fuck me. How? Just push it into me, I want to feel it. Say please. Please fuck me hard. You're alright...

Nice. - Bye! - Bye. Hey... I'm, I'm... with Sanja, at the bus stop. What time is it anyway? Ok, bye. How come you're back this early? The class ended early. Did something happen? - No. - Where's dad? In your room, watching the news. How many times did I tell you not to touch my stuff? Mum did... Your room was a mess, she cleared it out a bit. - Were you bored? - They're boring. I have to study. Alright. Study. Put something on. It's cold. You know that Stojan died? - Stojan from up the street? - Yes. -Shame, he was young. Why don't you put it in the dining room? - Sit with us for a bit. - I don't understand. Jasna, come here. - What's up at school? - Nothing. Does that school mate of mine, Mira, teach anything? Vesna, she did, in primary school. It looks like Mirko wants to buy the house! In Gajdobra? Why? To come over from Qatar on weekends, to enjoy the beauty of Serbian countryside? Come on, it's nice in Gajdobra. - Don't be cheeky, the man just wants to help. -Mum... Like Grandma and Grandpa. They don't believe you'll give them all the money from the house and they do believe you'll wash their shitty asses? -Stop it! In order to help dad go to surgery I'd wash them every day if I had to. And you won't even talk to your dad for five minutes. Does the princess have something to be ironed? She does. I don't even want to talk to you, you'll become a cleaning lady. You won't even ask that friend of yours to skip the queue, you even have to pay hen Thanks to her we are able to pay at all. Grandparents will be here for a couple of months while Mirko renovates the house. What kind of a top is this? Mum, do I tell you what to wear? Shit, we tried some coke, it's so fuckin cool. - You're all like rrn... -Yeah, and those guys were totally cool. You were there with Nikola all night, but the short one bored me to death. Liar, you're full of shit. I'm trying to dance and he's all over me, rubbing himself against me. - I couldn't dance properly. - Did you have a good time? She's laughing all night, I couldn't even move from the shorty. And then he wants to talk, and I wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole. - Hey, you know about this thing? - Yes. Ah, you do now? So, the guys are rubbing the coke like this... and then it goes numb here. - And we're pathetic. - We're not pathetic, we're not! I sniffed every two minutes, I was out of my head. - The left nostril, the rig ht, both... - I only did the left one. - How does it feel? - I want something and can't wait for it. You know, it's like you're full of energy, and in the morning your heart is not skipping beats, no depression and all that shit. - My heart skipped a little, but it's not like after speed, you're like normal. What did you do? It was great, I was with Crni and Djole... Woohoo, did something happen? - C'mon pussies, throw down something else! -Fuck it! - Just look at this slut. Look at her face! -Horror. Look at her, her face is like he's just shat herself. - Look at her arm, the fat duck. - She's like holding the wine, posh... Look at the whore! - Get up! Take the top off! - Why? She's playing a hottie on facebook, take it off and show her what's hot! Take it off... Show a bit of ass... Ah, this one is so good! - Lick it, come on. - Naah! -Lick it! My arse is a bit huge here. Like that, yes, the leg. That's not huge, that's fuckable huge, that turns them on. Ah, you hot zebra! - Wanna eat? - Not now. - Say when. - In half an hour, bye! I I'm a bitch, I am, so what! I am mad, but I'm aware of it all! I - Film us! - Yeah, bro, film us! Give it to me a little, bro! Sorry, bro. As water is a neutral substance, it could be expected that solutions are.. - Excuse me. - Sit there. Sit there! ...we add a strong base or acid into the solution... - Marija! - Come here! Come! It's a silvery white metal, soft and at the temperature... - How was it, what happened? - I sucked his cock. -Really? What a cock. It's like skin coloured, but not pale, it's strong and bursting with hardness, but still... gentle. - How big is it? - I don't know. - Approximately. -Like this. - Ah, not bad. But the head is not that big, it's like just right, like... like candy! Like a little candy! And it's good, really, straight and smells nice! - You only blew him? - Mhm. - What's that? - I cut myself, didn't notice. Were you good? Yes I was... I mean, I could've loosened my tongue a bit more. - What did he say? - Nothing. Good that you're here. Go to the chemist's and buy his medicine. I can't, I have to study. Send Milica, I always go. - And where is Milica? - I'm not here, I'm studying. - Just look at that ass! - I would tear him apart. - Are they looking at us? - No. Now what? If I were you, he'd never ignore me like that. I'd kick his ass. Who does he think he is? He'd fuck you right now, but he's a pussy. - Man, he is sooo cute! - Let's go there. Ivana, Sanja! Oh, girls, you're not saying hello! Oh, Ivana, you're so hot! - Lick my pussy! - Come, let's hang out. I mean, I'm really a gentleman, a nice ml: Crni! - HeY-" _Hey. You play well. - Hey, Djole. - Hey, Marija. You really play well. You too... play really well. - Got a beer? - Yeah. Djole is so cool! - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Fuck, fuck... Gimme that crutch, what are you, a cripple? Give it! Give what, your boyfriend is a cop, you pig-girl? Is the pig fucking the pig? It's ok, Marija, it's 0k... Bacon! Bacon! - Give it a rest, you fool! - I have a fool in my pants! No, "0, no, no, no! - Let go of me! - Hey pal! Give it, you gimpy gimp! I left the medications on the table. When you come back from school, give him two capsules and half the tablet. Capsules at half three, tablets at two. Tell him. If anyone's hungry you heat up the boiled potato. I don't know how to heat it up, let him heat it up if he's hungry. To wrap a baby, we use two cloth diapers. And, naturally, the wide hip position pants. First, we put the pants on the table... - That creep called me. - Who? The one from the party. - What'd you say? -You're stupid, you don't know how to wrap it. Hey! Who are you calling stupid, your mum's stupid! Fuck you! - Silence! - Miss, she called me stupid! Sit down and not a word from you! - Aw, you're so cute! - A diaper! Let's spin. Maybe they have those pointy bras here. Fucking amazing! That's so good. Like hell this is Louis Vuitton. This is supposed to be here, not there. - Bro, look at these shoes... - They're gorgeous! I Maybe I'm a narcissist, maybe I wear a sign that I'm a perfect woman I I My ego starts working and I ditch everyone I'm a taboo for every male I I Both hot and cold, both full and hungry I I Both good and bad, I'm ideal I I In every place, everything is in it's place I I You won't find another one like me I II am exclusiveness, they say I rock, I I Like a movie diva, ego maniac I II am exclusiveness, I'm the jack pot, I I I sweep them off their feet, that is chemistry I II don'y know, my boy, if you are my fit... I - He'll buy it! - Didn't I tell you to knock? He just called, come here. She packed some honey for you. Ah, I've been waiting since Summer. - Did she send some of that rakija of hers? -No... What, we need to celebrate that there'll be fuckload of us here? What's that language? Right... You don't care how your dad's doing, but you do care about new trainers. I've never asked you for anything. You should be grateful for always having had what you needed! - Grateful? - Yes, grateful! When was the last time you cleaned your room? When? You haven't talked to your father ever since we found out he is dying! Have you even wondered how he feels or do you only ever think of yourself, shame on you! I've given you everything, but that's not enough, hit me, hit me! You've already spat on him, but you'll be sorry later, you'll see! You're just destroying this family, that's what you're doing! Marija, that pole suits you. I'll give to you so you can shove it up your ass. Should we cough up some cash? I want it too. - Let's go to your place. - Why, you want to meet my mum? Hey... Are you still on call? Right. Okay. Right. So, you work out? Sometimes. - Can I show you something? - What? I want to show you a clip. Show me. I didn't turn out quite the best... No. Don't dare touch yourself. Hello. Yes, I'm on my way to school. No way. Coz there's no way I'm carrying their things, bye! - Hello, son. - Hi, grandpa. Hi, son. - Where did you put the blankets? - I don't know, you packed the sheets. What? Oh, just put them in... - Here they are! - Give me that. Mum, have you seen the things they brought? Look at this! That's your dad's jacket when he was little. Dad the hotshot. Look at this. Alright, Jasna, let them be, we'll put some of it in the cellar. They're only stifling us, what do they need all this for, look! Ten kilos of some glasses, ornaments, will they arrange it all around here. - Look at this! - Quiet, leave it. What's that you put in my room, gifts? As soon as I clear this, I'll take it out, okay? Mum, why are we having pictures of some old men and women in the middle of the living room? That's your granddad's brother Branko and his wife Milica. Your sister was named after her And your dad loved hera lot. I've never even seen this great aunt Milica. 'Course you have, she used to take you for walks around Gajdobra every day. - But she liked her drink, she did. - And never could get drunk. She used to take you to the pub, she'd put you on her lap, and drink and knit. The sweaters she made for you! Come here. Look how handsome they are. And this is your grandfather'... And these are your mum and dad in Gajdobra. - When was this? - When we raised the roof. Right, this is aunt Dara, her children Desa, Milan and... Steva n. This is you here, in your mum's belly. And this is mum's friend Ljilja. And this is you when you were little. Mum, dad and you. This is granddad's brother Branko... You're mad, you're taking pictures of dead people! What's the matter? There's nothing to be afraid of! - Hey, mate! -Hey. -You won't say hello to him? What the fuck? - Stop it... - What? Kick him! Look at the chain on him, it would suit you. Come here! Give me the phone. - Stop it, mate, don't. - Here's the limo for the gentleman! Come on. Get down, moron! Look up. Work that tongue. Well done, boy, well done! You're overdoing it! Ah, it's good inside, right? ♪ I never made it with you, coz I was so in love with you. ♪ I It's true I'm selfish, even plain sometimes, I I but for one thing, admit it, I was very good.

Does it hurt now? No, just put it in slowly and it's fine. - You like it when I fuck you in the ass? -Yeah. You're good for nothing better but to be fucked in the ass. Come and help me here... I have to study. Jasna, you have to help me, I can't do it all by myself. If dad has an attack before he goes to the hospital, they probably won't be able to operate. They say it's risky. I took my time off to spend this little time with him before... And when were you planning on telling me this? - Jasna my dear, why are you like this? - Like what? Dad's going to the hospital in three days, I even asked Ljilja to help get him in. I mean, she understands it. Her husband's left her and their son while he was still little and... She knows what it would mean if the three of us were left alone. You've already buried him. What are you saying? Jasna, what are you saying? Jasna... Hey... Go on, study. Study, and have straight A's, alright? You know Ljilja's son goes to school with you? Tosic, Djordje Tosic. - Does he know? - What? -Does he know dad's ill? I don't know, calm down. I don't want anyone to know dad's ill, do you understand that? Give me some money. Where? Your father's going to the hospital tomorrow. Going for a drink and then to Ivana's, to study. Please, stay in this evening, I never stop you from doing anything, just stay. - You're stopping me from studying. - Jasna, please. Mum, I'm asking you, I have to go out for a bit, to rest, and to study. - It will mean a lot to dad. - Dad's sleeping. Are you giving me the money, I really have to go. - What am I supposed to do with this? - That's all I have. Do you know how embarrassed I am when other people are paying for me? - What are they saying? - I don't have a clue here. Fuck Facebook, fuck America, Kosovo is Serbia, hey! Hey, pussies, shat your pants or what? Fly, break, trash! Tear it apart! Set those motherfuckers on fire! That's it, Crni! C'mon, Jaca! So, if they have a problem with me pissing on their lives, they can suck my cock and my hairy balls, all the way up to here! What, huh? Come on! Come on, pussies! Let's go! Serbia! - What group are you in? - What group? - Those exercises at the home. - First, why? You have to go at noon, me at three. Oh, fuck, that's today! I have to get a present for that child! - What did you get for yours? - I have a toy heart, I'll give her that. - Hey, moron, give me the shades back! - What presents? Us from the childcare group have these exercises, hanging out with kids and that. Fuck, I'll die, I can't sleep. Come here. Sit here, I'll clean up this. My sister made a mess. Fuck, I have no idea what to give to that child. I can't give her makeup... Not the broken comb either'... I drove him over. So, we'll see, he's calm, they'll operate on him tomorrow. Ool, I'm here with a mate from school, I'll just get my stuff. Let's go. Good morning. - I'm Djordje. - Hello, I'm Jasna's mother, Zora. - You're going to school with Jasna? - Not the same class. - We're in a rush, mum. - Nice, nice. Djordje... What's your last name then? Tosic. So, you're Ljilja's son? You look like Ljilja! Come, let your auntie Zora kiss you. Do you know, your mum's clone so much for Jasna's clad! We've just taken him for an operation at her ward. YQulvQ grgwn Ll D! - We have to go! - You have to eat something first. I just want you to know I'm very glad my Jasna has such a nice friend. Sit down. Look at the size of you! You know I used to babysit you when you were little? Yes... Ljilja just got her job, Jasna wasn't even born... You're two, three years older than her - It's better to eat here than in the kitchen? -Yes. You know who this is? It's Ljilja's son! My Ljilja's son! This is Jasna's grandfather! - Djordje. - This is Jasna's grandmother'... I would never recognize him! This is Jasna's sister, Milica... Look at him, I'm so glad you're friends. How strange that is... Your mum and I used to be best friends, life's lead us separate ways, what can you do, that's how it is. Just look... aren't you handsome. Jasna hasn't told me you're friends. When could she tell me, she's never home. Ever since her dad got ill she's never home. - Mum! - What? She's embarrassed about it. There's no reason to be, right? There's no shame in her dad being ill. - Mum, we're in a hurry, please. - Wait, in a minute. Eat, go on. Look at him! You know how naughty you were as a child, has your mum told you? No one could put you to sleep. You were tossing and turning like a whip top. And Jasna was even worse. - Mum! - Well, you were! Alright, go on, children. I'm so glad I've seen you. And give my very best to your mum. - Goodbye. - Bye. Crni told me his parents will go away to a spa. We'll probably go chill at his place. Come by, if you're still alive. - Call me. - Okay, give me the number: Let me type it in. - I'll call you ifanything's up. - Alright. Djole, Djole... This is Dragana, she's the caretaker of the children we're seeing today. Yes. So, in my group, there are 15 children aged 7 to 10. Just bear in mind, life at a home is not the same as life at a family. You'll see, they're so sweet, you'll get attached to them very soon, and they'll get attached to you. But once you leave, they can get agitated. Please, it's very important that you keep certain distance while dealing with them. You'll get to know the children, you'll establish contact, you'll be the ones to work with them in a couple of years, right? These are students who came to visit you. And Stana is in the first grade. When someone comes to visit, we say hello, right? Hello. We have intense activities with educationally neglected children, children who haven't been to school, street children who at the age of 9 or 10... Miroslav! Vesna! No running in corridors! Teachers help them, as mentors, with their homework. We are now in the common room. Come in. Children, your friends have arrived. Be nice. Come in. - Hello! - She is MY friend. Where does it say so? - You're my friend, aren't you? - What's your name? - Jasna, and yours? - Jadranka. Got a mobile? - Yes, why? - Give it to me. - Give it to me! - Get off! -Idiot! - Fool! - Hey! You'll break the phone! - Tell her to give it to me! - No way. She's been playing with it for hours! You come here and I'll give you the phone later: - Okay? - Yes. - You're pulling my hail: - I'm sorry. - What's your name? - Romeo. I'm Jasna. Get off, I want to talk to Jasna! Let's do it like this, alright? - You have nice hail: - Thanks, you too. I wanted to have it long like that. - Where's your mum? - At home. Is she pretty? I don't know... She is. She must be. Come, I'll show you something. - Come on, give me the phone. - I want to show you something. I'll give it to you later: - Promise? - Promise. Come here! Come, film me. Get away from my bed! Hey, stop, easy! Don't, don't! Fuck you! This is my bed. Take a seat. This is my backpack. This is my pencil case. There's a pencil, an eraser and a sharpener in it. These are my toys. I have something for you too. Romeo keeps stealing my things. I report him to Dragana, but he does it again. I beat him up, but he won't stop it. I hate him! Who are your best friends then? I don't know... Maybe... Jadranka and Romeo. Film me! Oh, film me too! Can you be my mum? Please, please, please! I can't be your mum. - How about an older sister? - Yes, I can be that. - I already have an older sister: - Really? What's her name? Nona. - Liar, her name is Radmila. - But I prefer to call herlvona. Does she come to see you? No. The judiciary organ forbade hen - Why? - When I was three, my father died, and my mum found another man and she left me with Ivona. - Radmila! - Fine, with Radmila. Ivona was a lot older than me and she had a boyfriend. This boyfriend was beating me all the time. Bow your head a little. And I was bleeding, here and here, and it hurt. Ah, you're so pretty, you can go be a model! And does your mum come to see you? - She does. - When did she come? You know, that time when she came, you met hen Ah. Right. I You wouldn't even feel if I crept under your skin, I I you'd give me all, I wouldn't ask for anything. I So, you always have to... Hold on, wait... Here. This beauty here is a bit ill, but nothing hurts her, right, Stana? Yes. I'm only a bit tired sometimes. Stana has a rare form of Wilson's syndrome, and the consequences are anomalies of the liver, increased heart rate, so Stana is not supposed to exert herself too much. You have to understand the work of a pediatric nurse is very hard. You have a huge responsibility and you have to accept the fact, or somehow get used to it, that some children are very ill. Some of them will even die. Take Stana, for instance. Two years ago doctors told her she'd only have a year to live. They operated, everything went well, they took a sample of the tissue for biopsy and we can see him tomorrow. I'm so hungry. Hey. I'm knackered. Well, come oven Oh, it's tomorrow. I forgot. Right, come pick me up at school around half eleven, I'll ask them to let me leave early. Yeah, I'll say it's because of my dad. Bye. I'm going to visit my dad at the hospital tomorrow. Mum says it's alright, they need to do some tests. - Then they'll know if he's okay. - Good. He'll get chemo afterwards. You lose hair from that, and throw up. Don't know, guess you do. I keep thinking, if he dies I'll go to the funeral high on E. You won't make it through the memorial service, you'll start dancing. I'm not going to whine there. I don't think he'd like that, me throwing myself on the grave, acting all mad. He's not like those idiots. He never was. You know what the first thing I remember about him was? Him kissing my mum. Milica was born and then some people came oven Then he squeezed my mum. You know how they were kissing then! It was never like that afterwards, they were really making out then. I was rolling on the carpet and then I caught his leg and then he was dragging me around. It feels so strange... When I remember something from when I was little. It really scares me. I keep having this feeling it never really happened. And what I do remember... It's all rubbish. But I remember'... his shoes. You fool. Come, let me make you feel better: - Come on! - No. Try another one. - Oh man! - Fucking shit! Right, left, and then the last door on the right. Come. Here, I brought you a snack. - I can't eat now. -Later. Help me with this... There. Take a seat. It's alright. Jasna! Jasna. Take a seat. I love you so much, I'd do anything for you. Well, for starters, you could learn to give a good blowjob. Sup“. This chemistry professor is crazy. You want to tell me something?

I guess he's fine, how should I know. Put your jacket on. - I'll call you. - Jasna, check that it doesn't burn. - I don't know where my bag is. - Here's your bag! Look, I'm in a rush, I'll call you back. - Did you pack pyjamas? - Yes, and the juice. - Where did you put the towels? - They're in the bag. Give me those crosswords. Mum? Hey, mum, where are you?
