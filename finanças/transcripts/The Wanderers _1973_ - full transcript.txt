WALKERS In nineteenth-century Japan There were people called "toseinins" Even though they carried swords, they were not samurai, but ordinary townspeople and peasants, most of which were not visible in the population register. They were homeless and unemployed, and they lived off gambling and cheating. The Toseinins invented various customs for sustain feeling of solidarity. One of them was greeting called "jingi". - Let me say hello ... - I first. Let me say hello to you. - I'm the first to greet you. - I insist. Please let me greet you. Forgive me for wanting to do it first. If you insist, please. I'm only an inexperienced novice. Me too, let me say hello to you. - Let me welcome you. - Let me say hello to you. I have to follow the customs therefore let me greet you. Perhaps I missed with customs, so please since you insisted so many times. Sorry. Thank you for being able to be the first to greet you. Since we just met let me introduce myself. I was born in Sakaomi in the Mino district. My master thirty was Yoshida no Iwasaburo. I am in this profession an inexperienced novice, and my name is shinta and it's very nice to meet you. Thank you for being so courteous self introduction. As you already mentioned we just met. My name is Kanpachi. As you can see, I have a role a simple servant of that family. Nice to meet you too. Sit down please. Sorry. - Let me show you something. - Please. I was wondering what to bring. During my wanderings I was unable to prepare nothing impressive but please accept that towel and hand it over to the lady of the house. A noble gift, but I must refuse to accept it. But it would be rude so I'd love to take it. - Let me say hello to you. - Let me say hello to you. Let me say hello to you according to the custom. Perhaps I missed with customs, so please since you insisted so many times. Thank you. Since we just met let me introduce myself. I was born in Kinasemura in Shinshu County about 15 kilometers north of Sainogawara. My name is Genta and I am a beginner toseinin, who wandered from place to place. It's very nice to meet you. Thank you for being so courteous self introduction. As you already mentioned we just met. My name is Kanpachi. I play the role a simple servant of that family. Nice to meet you too. Sit down please. Sorry. - Let me show you something. - Please. I was wondering what to bring. During my wanderings I was unable to prepare nothing impressive but please accept that towel and hand it over to the lady of the house. A noble gift, but I must refuse to accept it. But it would be rude so I'd love to take it. - Let me say hello to you. - Let me say hello to you. Let's skip these formalities. Okay? Do you agree? Yes. All right. Please, hot water. You can wash yourself. Thank you! Please! Help yourselves. Thank you! Wandering Toseinins must be prepared to drink tea. Having drunk it, they became employees of the family. So even if they were invaded by their own master, they would have to fight against him. Wanderers must eat two portions of rice. One brings misfortune, because one serving is offered to the deceased. When the wanderer can't eat two bowls, eats the middle of the first dose, and then fills it in with an extra. That was the custom. Only two servings? It is exact. Does he live here? What a dump! So your master was Yoshida no Iwasaburo? I did not know. You said so yourself. Really? Does someone like that even exist? You lied What is this one? You want to know? - I do not have to. - I won't say that. - Because you don't know. - Go! It's late. It's a bit dirty here but you'll get sleep. Thank you. Have you been hiking together for a long time? We met five days ago. Do you have a destination? Not. Heard it was in Sagawa there is such a gambler, Rakunosuke. Still young but he's already in charge there. I want to offer my services to him with good sake. I stayed at Sukegoro once in the province of Shimōsa. What a place! He fed at least twenty followers. They lived in a huge building with many rooms, where you could eat. I heard Sukegoro was a fisherman. Wanderers did not undress to sleep and they kept their swords the whole time. It's just in case unexpected attack. After officially saying hello were given reinforcements, a place to sleep and a small amount for the onward journey. Sorry. Dear guests. Wake up. Forgive me for not welcoming you. I am the owner of this property. My name is Ishizu no Juzo. Really? Are you a local gentleman? Will they attack you? Yes. This man, Naruo no Tanji, he has chosen my land. He ordered his people to open a casino in my area. We couldn't let that happen then to one of them we shaved half our head. And that son of a bitch got puffed up and will attack today. You cannot forgive those who break the toseinin code. I don't have too many people here that's why I am asking you for help. No problem. It is our duty. You fed us and welcomed us, so it is customary to help. Despite the lack of experience, we will defend your property. Our meeting was pre-arranged. We are committed to serving you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Burn in Hell! You son of a bitch! Die! You bastard! Where is this? My eyes! I can not see! Kujuro! We beat them! Don't let them get away. We'll kill everyone. Remember that! Don't forget! Get out! - Let me say hello to you. - Let me say hello to you. Thank you for being able to be the first to greet you. Since we just met let me introduce myself. I was born in Kinasemura in Shinshu County about 15 kilometers north of Sainogawara. My name is Genta and I am a beginner toseinin, who wandered from place to place. CHOJIRO It's very nice to meet you. - I'd like a second batch, please. - Of course. - Poproszę drugą porcję. - Oczywiście. The fight is going to be six in the morning with Kakube from Tazawa. Kakubei from Tazawa ... - Who is this? - Kakubei. We only get one bu per trip. He gets three. They don't appreciate us. They don't know each other. They will see again. Today it will be slippery under your feet and on the blades of swords. It won't be so bad when the rain washes away the blood. What is it? Throwing knives. But a toy. Regardless of the decision, gamblers' contests were costly. There were support fees associated with them, dressing the wounded and burial of the dead and a drink after the victory. That's why not infrequently a mediator was employed, thanks to both sides could end the dispute with the face. Thank you for waiting. Come on. But sometimes the mediator didn't help either And that mattered with inevitable expenses. Pride prevailed. - No way! - Forget it! Kill them! - Get them! - Attack! Gamblers avoided confrontation one on one. And that's because that it usually ended the death of one of the parties. It was a duel on exchanging a few blows, then one chased another opponent, which was not considered an escape Son of a bitch! Go to hell! I will not go! Gin! Let me say hello to you. Let me say hello to you. Let me say hello to you. Let me say hello to you. Let me say hello to you. Forgive me for insisting. Since we just met let me introduce myself. I was born in Matsudagori in the district of Hida, and I come from the city of Takane, where the wind roars among the peaks of the mountains. My name is Mokutaro and I am a regular novice. I am pleased to... meet you. This is not the end of the greeting. You brazenly crawled in in dirty shoes to go home! This is supposed to be home? - Do not see? - Not at first sight. Smaller. Sit down. My friend is here. Which one? It's not your problem. The code says that those who disregard customs should be cut. But you didn't take it my greeting. You can't do everything your way, mommy! You're a mess yourself! You don't run a casino and during the day you mingle. Leave! RELIGIOUS SOCIETY What are you doing? What are you guys doing here? And why do you hang out with them? Are you going to the Kumasaka temple? This year it was renewed, that's why a few will come important Kantō casino bosses. Or so I heard. Gamblers will swarm over there. - You're not coming? - Not. - Why? - If the bosses will be here, the amateurs will remain in the area. Usually there is some kind of guard but now everyone will ... in the temple. So this is the perfect opportunity to get into their pockets. Attack! And what? Odd. Even. I lost again. Unlucky day. Slyboots! Get out of here! Good for you yes! Cut thicker pieces so that you can taste it. My late mother she sliced ​​differently. And what is this water for? You're gonna wash away all that mucus. Give the guest hot water. You blur your eyes. Please don't bother me. And so I came unannounced. I'm waiting and waiting, but your old man's not coming back. Speak of the devil. I've been waiting for you. You look downcast. Haven't you won anything today? I didn't even play. They forced your son to build a bridge, and you gamble and you married a young girl. What kind of father are you? What is it? You do not want? Old man gambling debts is not repayable in installments. For now, that's all I have. I treat you like any client. I don't want to be too insistent but I have to pay for the permit for running a casino. That's how it works. You deluded me, you said that I will exchange one mon for four. It's a scam. Now you say that, but then you weren't complaining. Complaining about the premises it's an insult to the boss. If you don't want the money I'll take them. Next time you have to pay off the full amount. You have until spring. Have fun with your young wife. I will be back soon. I don't grow silkworms for bandits. Goddamn usurer! We have more and more debtors. I know. Scare them a little. You're not asking too much? Yes. Why am I allowing someone from outside the family to lead my main source of income? You cannot take a commission and ask me to collect my debts. Do you think I'm an idiot? Of course not. I want to pay you off as soon as possible. I think. You signed up for it yourself. I know. I can do business only for your benefit. You are to collect these debts. Okay. Cleaning and washing floors ... We've been sitting here too long. By custom from the fourth day wanderers do household chores. I doubt the boss is here. Bankame is a man to whom I could be loyal. I'll wait a few more days. He seems to have a poor helper. I will be a good helper. What? You moron, I'm gonna ... I'm gonna stay ... Sorry, I interrupted you. Dad? Dad! You are Genta. It's really you. Where have you been? You have grown up. I did not recognize you. The family is safe and sound? What's up You also had siblings ... Osaka. And also Jirosaku, Seikichi and Yosuke. They're probably grown-ups now. Are you already helping in the field? It's hard work ... I am no longer a farmer. You are not? Really? Agriculture is not for real men. What are you doing now? I am a toseinin. What? Come here. Are you homeless? I left home two years ago. Zapewne nie widnieję już w rejestrze ludności. Two years ago? Damn you. Did you leave your mother and siblings? Cattle. You are the oldest child. You should take over your father's duties. You should come back to them. You made a foul. And you? - What? - You're not coming back? Well, I ... This role did not suit me. Sorry. Was he cheating again? This is the third time. I won't let him go. I'm on it already. See you later. Visit me. I live in Futaemara. You won't leave hungry for me. Okumi! Where is she? I let the dealer cheat and then admit it, to ruin your reputation Bankame casinos. People will stop going there. I did it on the orders of the boss of Akayu. When the Bankame business will lose popularity, Akayu will take over his area. But don't worry. The dealer is on our side. Thanks to this I will be promoted to the deputy director. I am fed up with collecting debts. I don't want either to shame you. As long as you'll be here I don't care what you do. I don't want to wander around people anymore. He came. You must be Genta. Come in. Why so late? I already doubted you would come. You're handsome. Przystojny jesteś. I'll bring you water. Doesn't need to wash. Have you been drinking Not. Have you been with Bankame for a long time? For five days. You gave him a letter of recommendation from other casinos? No, I am only a wanderer aimlessly. Have you had a woman since you left home? Not. It's a widow. Her husband was a farmer. Being a lonely woman is dangerous so I look after her. And so for three years. I don't like her, she's playful. Don't insult her. She is very good to me. Such talk may be unpleasant. Please help yourself. Have a drink. They say you ran into your dad at Bankame's. How small this world is. Pour yourself too. Okay. Do not you feel lonely, wandering so aimlessly? I am not lonely. Really? Sitting in one place I also feel lonely. What are you talking about? So what, we look like mother and son? Are you okay? You talk nonsense. Are you here to take Daddy home? He's not coming back anyway. It's not your business. Contrary. Suddenly this boy appears saying he is your son. It gives food for thought. You should stay here. We will live like a happy family. Come here! Admit it, you son of a bitch! Mesa saw you at Akayu's. Do not underestimate me. Do you want to die? Goddamn cheat! I can't take this beating anymore. I'll tell you everything just forgive me. Your father had a word with the dealer and I was sold by Akayu. You are a toseinin so you probably knew. I will not allow something like this. Do you follow the code or sentiments? If you want to clear yourself of suspicion, bring me your father's head! Okay. You'll get her. Will you do it? You don't have to kill him. I made a commitment. You did not pledge your loyalty to him. You don't have to get mixed up to their fight for the terrain. It would be different if he hired you for your skill. Your father is not here. Come in. - He's not here? - What is it about? When he comes back? Do you have any business? Not. Go away. They are all in the field I'm here alone. I'm going there soon. Do you want to run away with me? Are you sure? Yes. You really understood what did i mean If they catch us, we can die. Are you still sure? He wants to do it! Slow! He will really do it! What a moron! It's here! Who are you? He did not do it. What's that supposed to mean? - Is that Yasukichi? - Yes. Was Genta here? Gent? Are you his friends? He wanted to kill you. What? They found out you work with Akayu. What? He wasn't here? Probably cracked. You better get out of here. Have you lost your mind? Calm down. I am yours father. You made a commitment! He did it! That you're my father? And did you act like your father? I'll kill you! You went to another woman leaving us destitute. Have you thought about what mom has been through? This is the punishment for her suffering! You sloppy bastard! I left the house because I wanted to meet you! I wanted to find you! Damn! Cold. I had to clear myself of my suspicions to conspire with my father. I wish I had met him. I shouldn't have left home. But my mother yelled at me: "Get out, thief," then I'm gone. She accused me of stealing her clothes so that I have something to play for. I was sick of this poverty So I figured I'd go away. Mother tried to stop me only that I have already made my decision. Not my fault, that my father ran a casino. It is not a profession worthy of a man. He was doing it in someone else's territory and he was paying for it ... I'd rather beg. It's even worse than stealing. I am ashamed of him. And the fucking Bankame kicked us out without a letter of recommendation. Six years ago, when I succeeded after the previous boss, there were only two henchmen. And now there are sixteen of them and they all swore loyalty. They are not easy to manage. I alone do not live beyond my means, but since the family is the most important I can't give you a letter of recommendation If it were just murder you could go on wandering but the penalty for killing a parent is death preceded by a full day exposure to public view. If I wrote you a letter of recommendation your new employers they might have problems. And I would lose face. I followed the toseinin code. It's travel money. These are some scraps. As if he was giving a tip. It's not enough for a man. Old skeptic. Genta got one shu and we got nothing. - Dusigrosz. - It was harassment. Great Lord! One wicked one! - He's not a man. - No. His territory had to be avoided. It looked after the public order at that time Kantō Region Overseer Office which worked like a mobile police unit. Officers they actually managed local, autonomous organizations consisting of with all kinds of people: owners of casinos, village leaders landlords and leaders of various groups. Mr. manager, why would I hide a man who killed his own father? They name us in different ways, but we are only farmers. Shall we send a chase group? We should, but we have a farm job. I could pursue him. Because you don't like working in the field Yasukichi was from from a town in Shinshu. If he escapes, it will definitely be there Goddamn snake! The snakes are said to be messengers of the Tengu. He will show you yet. You speak He could punish with rain. I told you so? Divine punishment for that snake. It's all fault damned Bankame! He kicked us out and gave no money. Apparently it's best you travel in company. So you can go too. Two bu! Your? Did you steal from your husband? That `s nothing. We respect your generosity. It will help us. Even a lot. But it hurts. It is your home? Where's my mother? She left without a word? Maybe ask someone from the village. Stupid! I can't get attention. I am outlawed and you are someone else's wife. Besides, I don't want to talk with no one from the village Who's there? You rascal ... You are Yosuke! You do not remember me? It's me, your brother Genta! I know! Where is Mom? In Yoshihama. And where is it? Far away from here. What about Jusaku and Osaka? They are with her. You stayed here alone? Shimono's family took me in. Wait! Because someone will see you! What about your head? What happened? Thread. Did you find something to eat? Probably not. That's not why I went there. How's the foot? Swollen. I don't want her. I don't want this foot. Pursuit group! Go to hell! Wait. He is not himself. I'm not chasing anyone. Okumi. Come back home. Who is this? Heiemon. That's true. I'm not chasing you. Seriously. Who is he? I am the son of Okumi's husband. Let's go. Move up. Your father gave you up for money. So you can't do what do you like. We feel bad without you. Your father should come for her. He's too old, so here came me. He couldn't do it. You have a roof over your head at home and a full plate. And no worries. I will not tell anyone, that you ran away with them. If you stay with the murderer they will arrest you too. Think for yourself. - Will you let him talk like that? - What can I do? These are family matters. You're flattering! You want to possess her when your old man is nice! Not at all. I'm taking her for her sake. Are you sure no one is chasing us? I do not have a clue. I have no grudge against you, Okumi. Look, it's for her. Hold on. Now come on. Will we kill him? - He can report on us. - Leave him. They won't catch up with us anyway. Leave me. Cholera! Leave it on or you'll only make it worse. Will you sell Okumi to the brothel? Shinmachi is not far from here. There are two inns there. A trip back and forth it will take me one day. It would be for the best. Okumi doesn't want to go home anyway. But her stepson was right. He's gonna make himself problems traveling with me. Okumi is also a murderer now. She is absent with thoughts does not know what is happening. Who will go? - I. - you? Someone might recognize you. I'd better go. I can't do this to her. I'll go with her. Shinta could hurt himself by the wrath of god. He will recover. So let's go when he recovers. Where? To the Iioka family from Shimosa. When we will be in Sukegoro, no one will chase you anymore. "Meshimori onna" means female serving meals to customers. But this definition is shallow. They're prostitutes tolerated by the shogunate. They could work in the inn two prostitutes, could wear only cotton clothes. But this rule was often ignored. Most of these women she was the daughters of poor farmers. They were sold for one to five ryō. Is she healthy? Of course. Hang on, you'll get better soon. For a woman without a letter of recommendation from the casino owner I will pay only after the inspection. Don't worry about her past. Before modern drugs appeared, diseases were considered for the revenge of the gods and the Buddha. Currently this disease is manifesting itself severe pains and spasms, we call it tetanus. You can write? I need your signature. Gent ... Eight coins. Omatsu! I'm going. Can you do it? Definitely? You will have a place to sleep and what to eat. You will live normally. You will endure these three months. Will you come back for me? Yes. I'll be back for you in three months. It fluttered like a whip, it crackled. I will be waiting for you. Even if it took a thousand years. If you don't want to stay here then I can return the money to him. I will wait here until you come back for me. THE FIFTEENTH YEAR OF THE TENPŌ AGE (1844) PROVINCE OF SHIMŌSA Thank you for welcoming you. I was born in Kinasemura in Shinshu County. Since we just met I will introduce myself. I am Genta and I am a toseinin, wandering from place to place. By following the code I have problems with the law. It is very nice to meet you. Thank you for this courtesy And I'm sorry, I'm talking to you in advance. As you already mentioned we just met. I'm a casino tenant's henchman Iioka no Sukegoro in Node, Node no Hanbeia. My name is Hayamatsu and as you can see i'm a newbie. It was in 1844. in the district of Shimosa Unakamigori w okręgu Shimosa Unakamigori pretended to be a police custody, attacked Sasagawa no Shigezo in Katorigori on the River Tone. This famous incident he is known as "Tenpō suikoden". As a result a war has broken out for fertile lands, known as "Higatahachimangoku". These two families at the time they clashed frequently, being in constant readiness to the attack of the opponent. We got in to Node no Hanbeia, so we could sleep there not outside. We'd be better off at Iioka no Sukegoro. I do not understand you. Why didn't you go there right away? It's less than eight kilometers from here. But... It would be awkward to go there in such rags. You said you've been to Sukegoro before. Yes? Liar! Yesterday I overheard that Node no Hanbei from the Iioka family betray them and go to Sasagawa Shigezo. What? You slept like dead. I went to pee and heard Hanbei he was talking to his people. What are you gonna do with it? I do not know. Though something occurred to me. We should ... kill Hanbei. We bring Sukegoro his head. We would play boldly. Sasagawa Sukegoro will praise us. - It will not succeed. - Why? No and that's it! We have obligations towards Node no Hanbeia. - This is an exceptional situation. - We have to respect that. Just as I thought, Hanbei goes to Sasagawa. Are you sure you heard right? He is wearing formal attire and seems restless. He's probably very good with the sword. ou attack him from behind. But I do not want. - Then I'll kill him myself. - I won't let you, imbecile! Are you crazy? He will hear you yet. You don't want to belong to the Sukegoro family? This is not the point. Would you attack me? I did not swear loyalty to you. Stop! Son of a bitch! Out of the way! What are you waiting for? What are you doing? I will kill you, you bastard! Dumbass! Toseinina commitments are not based on benefits. So why did you kill your father? You wanted respect as a man! You were only thinking about yourself. - It's a lie! - Not at all! It's a lie! I give up. Stop. Stop! Where is he? He went to shit? Tekst polski - Altair87 Korekta - JM
