25.000 English RETAiL SDH DVD Subrip PAL ? 12.11.2021 [Church bell tolling] [All shouting in Moldavian] [Shutter clicking] Second in Command (2006) [Crowd shouting] Until something happens, my plan is to stay in this wonderful bar of ours and get drunk. The locals are torching your flag. You know, we should film them. When they burn something interesting I will hit record. Like the new President? Amirev? Amirev. The question is, will he last? (Sandra) Well, he made it through the first week. The people love him and he won the election fair and square. (Mike) Our reluctant loser, Kirilov, has other plans for Amirev. Stop! IDs please. I'm here to collect Commander Sam Keenan. Thank you, sir. Thank you. So, nobody's going to the airport to pick up your new Ambassador? New second-in-command, Deputy Ambassador, ain't worth changin' shirts for. Mmm-mmm. That's not who they're flying in today. [Whispering] I've heard it's the new military attach?. (Sandra) Military attach?, interesting. (Walt) You know, word on the street is the militia loyal to Kirilov are planning a coup. Amirev knows that he has a serious insurgency problem on his hands. He also knows that his army simply isn't up to handling it. [Scoffing] Yeah, no shit. Which is exactly why Norland requested this guy. (Mike) He's the kind of guy you definitely want on your team if you're expecting trouble. And let's face it, the US are taking this insurgency problem very seriously. (Sandra) So, who is he? His name is Keenan. Commander Samuel Keenan. Navy SEAL. (Mike) He's the toughest guy I have ever met. (flight attendant) Your bag, sir. Thank you. Sounds like you know him. Yeah. Uh, Michelle and I embedded with his team in El Basra. She however got to know him a little better than I did. Sir. (Sandra) Oh, not our super clean Michelle "United World News" Whitman? (Mike) The very same. (pilot on radio) Delta Four, requesting clearance for take-off. (Mike) Michelle told me that he's coming by the hotel before he starts work. (Sandra) Lucky Miss Whitman. [Walt laughing] [Engine starting] (Sam) What's your name, Corporal? Uh, Butler, sir. Do you know the Hotel Continental? Sir, my orders were to take you straight to the Embassy, sir. Then on to the Presidential Palace. But the hotel is kind of on the way. In the opposite direction. (Sam) Give me an hour, okay? (Butler) Yes, sir. [Elevator bell dinging] [Knocking on door] Who is it? How are you? [Michelle laughing] Ah! [Protesters shouting] [Michelle giggling] [Protesters shouting] You okay? I'm fine. Hey, man. [Grunting] Journalist scum! [Gun firing] Shit. Sam. (Mike) Hey, buddy, stop. Go home, we don't want you here! We're press! [People screaming] Tell your news programmes to leave! Don't shoot. [Exclaiming] [Glass shattering] [Screaming] [Both speaking Moldavian] [Both grunting] [Panting] [Woman shouting] Get out of the way. You, get down. Sir, you okay? I'm fine. Get some ambulances, now. Yes, sir. You, come on, let's get out of here. Michelle, you better come with me. (Butler) Where's the phone? You'll be safe at the Embassy. I'm a reporter, Sam. Like him. (Butler) You know where the phone is? You, answer me. You wanna be next? If we don't show the world what's happening, who will? Sam, you know me well enough by now. Sir, Civil Guards are on their way. You should not be here when they arrive. [Woman screaming] Let's go. Stay off the streets and let me find out what's going on. Don't worry, Sam, we'll be fine. Michelle, I'll come back for you. [Siren wailing] [People yelling] Jesus Christ, that's gotta be a bomb. What's there? It's the army barracks. This country is supposed to be stable. They just had elections. Well, someone didn't like the result. (Sam) Move on. [Tyres screeching] Gunnery Sergeant Darnell. Commander Sam Keenan. Gunnery Sergeant. Gunny will do just fine, sir. [Shell exploding] Nice town, huh? Sleepy. It has its moments. Good to meet you, sir. Commander Keenan. I'm Jennifer Lennard. Nice to meet you. (Jennifer) Right this way, please. Ambassador Norland speaks very highly of you. George? He's a good man. I get the feeling this town is going to need him more than ever. [People chattering] He's right through here. Sam, how are you, son? Ambassador, sorry, I got delayed. Oh, our... our RSO, John Lydon. (Norland) Marine Detachment Commander John Baldwin. Our new military attach?, Commander Keenan. Welcome to the deep end, Commander Keenan. Here's the top sheet. Small cadre of insurgents, former military and loyal to ex-President Kirilov, are stirring up opposition to the new President. (Baldwin) This man is their leader, Tavarov, who obviously ordered the hit on the journalists' hotel. They're hardliners, old school communist, violently anti-US. But mainly street corner showboaters, till now. [Protesters shouting] Comrade Tavarov. It's time, now. Luca. Sir. Move in. [All shouting] [Speaking Moldavian] [Protesters chanting] You sure you're all right to do this? Your boyfriend was pretty insistent that we stay out of trouble. Yeah, well, trouble has a way of finding me. How do you think I met him in the first place? This place is about to blow, you can feel it. Come on. [All chanting] Ambassador. Ah. Frank Gaines. CIA Station Chief. Our new, uh, military attach?, Commander Keenan. They still call you B.C.? What do you mean? Well, you go to a hotel, a half hour later we have a body count of eight. Frank, Sam is on our side. So were those dead reporters. Now, what's your intel on the gunmen and the bombers? Well, we have one major explosion and three smaller blasts. My contacts report roving bands of militia, maybe as many as 500. They've taken out the military barracks here and the, uh, Civil Guard HQ here. They've shot up US business interests too. We have unconfirmed American casualties. What about the rest of the army? (Gaines) President Amirev sent General Borgov to take out what we thought was a militia base camp. Satellite pictures show he's turned back from the mountains, so I'd say five hours, minimum. I'll give you three to one on Amirev swinging from a rope by midnight. [Protesters shouting] As the capital falls into anarchy, the rioters have cut the President off from both his military and police. (Michelle) Amirev needs his army who are reportedly hours away in the mountains. [All chanting] Kirilov! Kirilov! [Cell phone ringing] Yes, Comrade. Shoot. Yes, sir. [Screaming] [Woman continues screaming] (Mike) Where did that come from? One of the Palace Guards has opened fire. [Protesters jeering] [People shouting] You getting any of this? Yeah, all of it. (Michelle) They're storming the palace. [Metal rattling] "Our palace guards have opened fire Mr President." "On my own people? Who gave such an order?" "They are jumpy sir. It's understandable." "My army could restore order immediately, yet they are still hours away." "But sir, we've lost contact with General Borgov." "The airport is open. I have organised a plane for you." "A plane? When all other options are closed?" "Why does so obvious an escape remain open to me?" "Have Captain Servat come in." "You must leave now, sir." "Put my Chief of Staff under arrest." "Mr President?" "I don't need his advice any longer." "Mr President!" Ambassador Norland, please. (Michelle) The militia are clearly encouraging the people to press forward. How many marines do we have? How many people do we have to protect? Officially an Embassy staff of 27. Plus 42 other US nationals in the city, mostly oil and telecom engineers. Marine Embassy Guard detachment of 15. 15? That's it? This was not considered a hazardous duty station. Look outside, Mr Gaines. (Gaines) I know. That was President Amirev. Communists are storming the Presidential Palace. And? He wants our help. So, tell him people in hell want ice cubes. How many weapons and transport do we have? Whoa, whoa, hold on a second there, B.C. I see where you're going with this. It's not gonna happen. Sir, the Secretary of State would have our asses. If we're gonna do something, we're better to move now. Yeah, yeah, well, with all due respect... Hear him out, Gaines. Those marines see any action? Uh, Gunny, uh, Butler, and Zanger all, uh, spent a tour in Iraq. Works for me. Get me in, I'll get him out. Do it. Follow me. Sam. Since we still haven't replaced my former deputy, uh, I'm appointing you to temporarily fill the slot. You're my new second-in-command. [All booing] Less protesters back here. It's fully loaded, sir. Thank you. Pull up here, I should be able to go this way. Service entrance to the palace. Shit, those Palace Guards look like they've got their hands full. [Protesters chanting] Kirilov! Kirilov! Make sure they keep holding. There's Sam. You're the gentleman who will assist my travel? Yes, sir. Where is your driver? Follow me. (Baldwin on radio) Sam, we've got a problem. The mob's coming through. They're storming through the service office door. Switching to Plan "B". Follow me. (Sam) Baldwin, cover us when we come out. (Baldwin) Copy, Sam, we're right behind you. We've got movement. With just a handful of guards protecting the palace and his most loyal Generals many hours away, the feeling in the insurgents is one of "now or never." God, Sam! [Exclaiming] [Protesters screaming] Get up. Keep your head down, sir. [Tyres screeching] [All yelling] (Michelle) Let's get out of here. (Mike) Yeah, we're out of here. Tavarov. Cover the US Embassy. (Baldwin) Tiger One, we got your back here. [Tyres screeching] You roll back to the Embassy, sir. (Sam) Copy that. Hang back and cover our flank. Gunny, we're coming in. Cover us. (Gunny) Roger, Sam. Ready to deploy. (Sam) Watch it, we're cut off. (Baldwin) I got the rear, Sam. (Sam) Hold on, sir, I'll get you out. [Panting] Brace yourself. I got it, go! [Engine revving] [Man shouting in Moldavian] (Baldwin) Move out, cover the street! Pazzini, cover me! [Shouting in Moldavian] (Baldwin) Take him out! I've got it, go! [Exclaiming] [Groaning] Get up on the wall. (Marine) Quick! [Man shouting in Moldavian] Coming in from the left. I'm coming around, move! Mr President, are you okay? I'm fine. Okay, come on. Sir, we'll have to make a run for it, okay? [Screaming] Grenade, give me a grenade! Go, get the hell out of here. Only shoot on my orders! Follow me. Go! Cover! Cover! Fire! Fire! [Panting] Get those goddamn gates open! (Gunny) Over here! (Marine #1) Incoming fire! Get down! [Whistling] (Marine #1) Close the gates! (Marine #2) They're pulling back. Welcome to the USA, Mr President. Thank you. I am in your debt. Sir, the Ambassador is waiting inside. (Marine #2) Re-group now! Sir. Corporal Zanger just radioed in. He and Pazzini are still out there. I'll assemble a reaction team and bring them both in. Negative, Gunny. The city is crawling with militia heading our direction. I need all available men right now. Zanger and Pazzini are two of my best. I'm sure they are, and they're marines. I'm counting on them out there. Yes, sir. [Shouting in Moldavian] Jones, left flank, Red, right flank! (Gunny) Move! (Marine) Hold your position. (man on PA system) Attention, please, all civilian evacuees, please assemble in the lobby for a security briefing. Here you go. Hi. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Are you sure? Hell of a time for a tour group. They're US nationals who work in the city. We bussed them in for their own safety. We need to get control of our defences. Is there a map of this place? Yeah, the Marine Unit is down the hall and to the left. ACR is in the basement through Comms. Come with me, I'll show you the Embassy plans. (man on PA system) Would evacuees please remain in the lobby and await further instructions. [Brakes squealing] They re-grouped at the top of the street, Gunny. Enough ammo to hold off a troop of girl scouts. Yeah, the only antipersonnel weapon we've got is bad breath. I've spotted an RPG. I'll give the Ambassador the great news. Now, we do this the hard way. We don't have much time. (Embassy official) Let us know immediately if there's any change in your plans. Incoming! (Marine #2) Down! [All screaming] [All cheering] You okay? Yeah. Call for backup, seal the windows. Right, sir. (Marine) You two, on me! [Guns firing] [Amirev coughing] Get him downstairs into the bubble, now! You okay? Huh? Norland! Norland. Fuck, Norland. What, Sam? Medic! Medic! Please, here. Please, what's the damage? They hit us with RPGs. (nurse) Let me take a look at you. No. You're gonna be okay. Hold on. [Gasping] I don't think I'm gonna make it. Best to leave this in. (Gaines) Amirev is inside the bubble. He's safe. For now. [Gasping] [Norland gagging] [Gasping] [Sighing] [Speaking Moldavian] (Baldwin) Sir, this is Marshall Geller of Comms Tech. Hey, Marshall. Sir. How is the President? Sir, if there's any background information, anything you know. He's good. [Beeping] White House situation room, you're on. Ready, sir. This is Sam Keenan. I regret to inform you that Ambassador Norland has been killed in the Embassy attack. Richard Hammond, Secretary of State. Our sympathies, Commander Keenan. How did this happen? A coup d'etat is in progress. Amirev is in the Embassy and we've been hit with an RPG. John Franklin, NSA. (Franklin) How is your security? We are surrounded by militia loyal to Kirilov. I need backup. (Anderson) This is General Anderson. Our nearest Marine Expeditionary Unit is about six hours due east of your current position. You folks are just gonna have to do whatever you can to hold the fort until they can arrive. Understood. And if you don't mind sir, on the double. Copy that. (Hammond) Commander Keenan, we'll keep the lines open for you here at state, the Pentagon and Ops Centre CIA. Let us know immediately if there's any change in your plans, or your situation. Good luck. This is General Anderson. I'm issuing orders for the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit to proceed with an emergency Embassy Reinforcement Mission. [Computer beeping] O'Brien, check the message. Message relayed. (man) This is Fort Victory. Message received and understood, over. (officer) Go, go, go! Move, move, move! Scramble! Move your ass! Move your ass! [Marines chattering] We're ready to go. [Marines chattering on radio] (pilot) Delta 11, ready. Okay, birds are in the air. Delta 13, birds are flying. All right, boys. Sit tight, you've got a long ride. Raise your hand if you feel confident about our security. What we do have is an E&E plan. You heard my discussion with the Secretary of State. Case closed. Evacuation is our only option. The longer we delay the harder it'll become. The evacuation plan was designed for a staff of 15. We have over 50 people here. (Sam) And a full-on siege outside. How long do we have until General Borgov returns with his troops? About four hours. By then we'll have militia trying on our pants for size. Ambassador Norland said he would not let this fragile democracy fail. I'm not going to let him down. We hold the fort. I hate to piss on your little parade, Keenan, but Norland is dead. Jesus, am I the only one here who thinks life would be rosier on the other side of that mob? Evac is not an option. Vietnam is history, pal, get over it. Frank, you're not being helpful. Helpful is not sacrificing more American lives in a hopeless situation, John. This guy has been in country less than a day. What does he know? (Geller on radio) Sir, you'd better come to the TCU. On my way. They broke in on Channel 4. How? Don't know, he won't talk to me. He just wants the man in charge. [Beeping] This is Sam Keenan. Over. I said I only want to speak to man in charge. The Ambassador. He was killed. I'm in charge. My name is Tavarov. I represent the Revolutionary People's Government. (Tavarov) We demand the release of President Yuri Amirev. To stand a trial for the murder of innocent civilians gunned down on his order outside the palace. (Tavarov) Over. Amirev is under our protection, which is US soil. (Sam) If he did commit those crimes, there are proper and legal ways to proceed. Not at the point of a gun. That's how it works in a democracy. (Sam) Over. [Man speaking Moldavian] We have demanded the release of President Amirev. Look outside, Mr Keenan. (Tavarov) In front of your gate. Shit. The roof. You, uh, got a minute, John? Why did the Vietnam reference get him so riled? He was born there. His mother was part of the French Diplomatic Mission. His old man was some jarhead officer who bought a bullet when we pulled out of Saigon. No wonder he's not big on evac. No. But he's big on ego. This guy is a loose cannon. We just went from George Norland to George of the Jungle. I'm going back channel on this. You might consider doing the same thing if you wanna save this place and everybody in it. [Brakes squealing] [Groaning] [Grunting] Ahh! Out! Get out! [Whimpering] Get out! Redwood Two, we got three hostages including one woman being held at gunpoint. Over. [Panting] [Exclaiming] Yeah, that's General Illienev. Other guy looks like press. (Gaines) And that woman. Michelle. Michelle Whitman. (Gaines) Of course it is. United World News. Yeah. Mr Tavarov, if we are going to talk, release the hostages now. Our demands are clear. Release President Amirev into our custody. Or these people will be executed. Can I remind you, the Geneva Convention, about prisoners of war? Unless I am mistaken, we are not at war. The hostages are innocent civilians. Then release our President. [Speaking Moldavian] It's very simple. He's not fuckin' around. Our position on that is clear, Mr Tavarov. Over. [Gasping] [Whimpering] [Grunting] [Breathing heavily] You have 15 minutes. Then we will kill them both. (Tavarov) Then you are next, Mr Keenan. You and everyone inside the Embassy. We are taking our country back. How we do it, it is up to you. [Sighing] We have no choice. You read my mind, sir. I'm gonna have to park those thoughts about Beyonc?. What are you thinking, Keenan? We're going out there for a rescue. Gunny, what we got? We got two Recon Marines, two trained snipers. If we can create a diversion, we can get those hostages back. You don't have anything big enough. You're right. Two men in the field. The best they can do is to draw fire. I know it hurts to agree with me, but let me finish. You don't have anything big enough, but I do. A little insurance policy I've been hiding by the name of Charlie Four. (Sam) Tiger One, this is Redwood One. Come in. Tiger One. Over. What's your location? (Zanger) Baktiar Street. Are you mobile? Just four legs between us. [Speaking Moldavian] Okay, gentlemen. (Gaines) There is a bicycle store on Plechia Street, which is two blocks east. Okay, we'll find it. The owner is gonna ask your name. Tell him, "Michael Jordan." Call us when you're inside, and guys, haul ass. Okay, let's move. [Speaking Moldavian] [Grunting] [Gasping] Sir, a man calling himself Tavarov just killed a hostage. More hostages will be killed unless I turn you over. I need a straight answer. Please. Did you order your guards to shoot at the people at your palace? No. Let me explain something. These men are brutal. We fought against them, 10 years. (Amirev) Suffered their abuses for more than 20. If I thought surrendering myself to them would stop the bloodshed, I would do it. But the opposite is true. Only by defying them can I protect my people. I'm very sorry you're caught in the middle, Mr Keenan. Whatever you decide, I will understand. Thank you. My army is coming. (Borgov) This is General Borgov's 18th battalion en route to the American Embassy. Our ETA will be four hours. Do you copy? This is General Borgov's 18th battalion en route to the American Embassy. Our ETA will be four hours. Over. (Zanger) Hi, Michael Jordan. Good to meet you. Follow me. Okay. (Zanger) You got the radio? Here's the C4. Great, thanks. All right. Watch our backs. You squawk twice if there's a problem. If we're being followed, you're found, whatever. Understand. Okay. Let's get this thing on the road. (Zanger on radio) Bike is in position. Tiger One. All set. Over. (Sam) Redwood One. Copy. All set. On my command. Three, two, one, go. [People screaming] Cover! Cover! [Screaming] (Zanger) Fire! [Screaming] [Guns firing] Move! (Marine #1) Go, go, go! [Tyres screeching] Go, go! Get the hostages! Get down! Move out! (Marine #2) Quick, move! [Guns firing] [Screaming] Come on, guys! Let's go! (Marine #3) Hustle! Man down! Come on! Get him up. Come on. (Marine #4) Let's move them out, come on! Let's move it! (Marine #5) Come on, hurry up! (Marine #6) Quick! (Marine #7) Here! Need some help here! (Gunny) Medic! Medic! There's a man still out there, sir. Sir. [Groaning] [Grunting] [Both grunting] (Sam) Come on, Mateo, let's go. [Exclaiming] [All grunting] [Groaning] [Scar screaming] (Sam) Come on. I think we can make it back. (Sam) Close the door. [Man shouting] [Men shouting in Moldavian] [Screaming] Get the medics in reception. We got injured. [Michelle coughing] (nurse) You all right, sir? (Mateo) Oh, God, my leg. That woman's been injured. You'll be fine. I need morphine. [Mike coughing] Are you okay? (Marine) Take it easy, take it easy. Baldwin, get the medics. (Baldwin) Sir. (Sam) And secure the compound. (Gunny) Keep on holding, Mateo. Move! Suck it up. It's great to have you back barking orders, but we need intel faster than they need a Band-Aid. (Gaines) You two are reporters, right? Yeah. How many troops did they bring to the palace? Uh, 50, 100, I have no idea. We were filming and then they came after us and we just ran. And the rest of the Civic Guard? There were these men arriving in trucks carrying AK-47's and they fired at them. You recognise firearms? Research is part of my job. Okay, good. What other equipment did you see? Did they have tanks? (Michelle) No tanks. Any heavy armoury? (Mike) No. We just... We just saw trucks. What about the leader, Tavarov? Did he try to hurt you? Did he say he planned to shoot you? No. The opposite. He said he would be happy to release us. I want to see both of you in my office when you're finished. Gunny. What's General Borgov's position? He's still 120 miles away. With heavy armour, I'd say, uh, three and a half hours. They're still mopping up the dead out there. Corporal Chevanton puts their casualties at 25 dead, 12 wounded. That will not stop Tavarov. No, he'll know help is on its way. It's just gonna speed things up. He'll hit us with everything they've got. Unless we give them what they want. Gunny? Sure. I'll give them what they want. So long as they want hell. Marine's balls for friggin' brains. Hey, we got the hostages back, didn't we? Keenan. Your mandate here is not to turn this into the Alamo. Great movie. Sure. But everybody died. We got Texas, didn't we? (Chevanton) Sir, we've got movement. Yes, we have all that under control now. Yeah. Can you guys... Incoming! [All screaming] [Alarm beeping] (Chevanton) Post Five has been hit. They got the comms array. Comms are out. We need to update Washington. See if they can give us something else. Come on, move. I'll have to rig the Satphone. (Sam) Let's go. What the... [man coughing] (Geller) Just be a minute. Got a lock. Washington. Do you copy? Over. (Anderson) This is General Anderson. Copy that. Yeah. Patch me through to the, uh, Secretary of State. (Hammond) This is Secretary Hammond. What is your current situation? Over. Sir, militia forces destroyed our communication centre. Sir, uh, Mr Secretary, this is Frank Gaines, CIA. We are outnumbered by over 20 to 1 at the moment. We have no cover on three sides, and the militia may have seized government tanks and heavy weapons. (Sam) Yeah, but... Sir, with relief forces still hours away and General Borgov's army out of contact, I strongly urge that we reconsider the plan to evacuate, and take advantage of imminent night cover. That's an opinion which I cannot support, sir. Would you stand by for a moment, Commander Keenan? (Anderson) Sir, I think you should take a look at this. Gentlemen, we have a problem here. Commander Keenan. (Hammond) This department has not received official notification that you've replaced Captain Baldwin as acting Deputy Chief of Mission. Over. I'm not getting you, sir. The cable replacing Captain Baldwin as acting Deputy Chief of Mission was never sent. Officially, he is in charge, not you. I am hereby ordering you to assist him any way you can. Could you put Captain Baldwin on the line? This is Captain Baldwin. What is your assessment of the merits of E&E? I cannot guarantee the safety of anyone in this facility. I would therefore agree that evacuation would be advisable. Captain Baldwin, you are authorised to proceed. (man on radio) This is Delta 13, we are en route and ETA is three hours. Over. [Knocking on door] [Door opening] I heard the staff talking. And? They say we're moving out. Is that so? Sam, if we stay, we're dead. If we go, we're ducks in a shooting gallery. Well, it's Baldwin's call now. Michelle, Baldwin is a good guy. But he's never been in a combat situation. But this is his turf. This is your life. Does it ever occur to you that you might be wrong? Not this time. You know, it's okay to run when you have explored all the options. We'll talk about this later. I tried to warn you. We don't have time to build a horse or dig a tunnel. We don't have to. Someone already did. Talk to me. (Gaines) Now, here's a little something for you. What is it? Paranoid bastards built all kinds of shit under the city. Bomb shelters, command posts. More tunnels than the New York subway. That's lucky for us. All stations. (Gaines) Harry is open. Over. Birch One to all staff. Initiate final burn. (Gaines) Just the sensitive stuff. Bag it all. Burn it to the furnace. (man on PA system) Attention all personnel. Please make your way to the first floor lobby and prepare for immediate evacuation. And then when they told me the situation... All quiet up here. Stop there. Tiger One. Transport ETA. Tiger Two, ready. Out. Tiger One, tunnel exit located and secure. Over. Just keep it movin'. Hey, folks, about a quarter mile till we reach open air. Let's stay tight. (Butler) Come on, let's go. Look, I'll give you the, uh, details of the evac plan when we're on the bus and out of the city. So, if you could just take your place in line. I'm staying. That would be contradicting a direct order from the Secretary of State. Tavarov will want a point of contact inside the Embassy. Let it go, Keenan. Face it, pal, you just weren't up to the job. (Gunny) Redwood Two. The men are briefed for a tactical withdrawal. Out. Birch One. Copy that. Suit yourself, tough guy. [Sighing] (Butler) Lt'll be all right. (man) This way. There are two more comin' through. Over. [Sighing] Tavarov's men are still gathering out front. Right. By the time he's inside, we'll have a half-hour head start. I'll just divert the Marine Expeditionary Units to the new away point, then we chopper out the civilians. Simple. You made the right decision. Yeah. Redwood Two. Clarify status, Tiger One. Over. Sir. This way. Keep moving, please. If you boys go AWOL again, I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah, you get stuck in a hole again, I ain't gonna save your sorry ass. Good to see you. Follow me. Let's go. Redwood Two. Clarify status, Tiger One. Over. (Zanger) Tiger One. Hatch is open. Over. Come on. There it is. Redwood Two. Go, go, go. Stay low, stay low. Over. All right, let's get up there and cover. Come on. Nice work. Let's get them on the bus. Go, go. Redwood Two. Clarify status, (Gunny) Tiger One. Over. Almost there, sir. (Baldwin) This is Birch One. President is en route. Over. Why don't you attack this Embassy? What are you waiting for? Okay. Holding. Better, better way. It's not right. Shit! What are you doing? (Zanger) Hey! Hey! Shit. [All screaming] Retreat! All back to the Embassy. Go! (Marine) Go, go, go! Michelle! Move out! We've been set up. We've been set up! Hey, guys! Guys! [Both screaming] (Butler) Come on, move! Come on! Move! Get back to the Embassy, quick! Move! Get them out of here! (Butler) Move! Go, go! Sir, they knew we were coming. Come on. [Man shouting] Let's move inside. [Men shouting in Moldavian] [People screaming] (Gunny) Back inside. Let's go. Let's go! (man) Move, move, move! (Marine) Come on, guys, let's go. [Men yelling in Moldavian] [Screaming] Get the people to the TCU and the President to the ACR. Now. Come on, move. Let's go. Where's Michelle? Where's Michelle? She's still in the tunnel, I think. Keenan, don't. It's too late. Leave it, they're gone. I want this Embassy combat ready in 15 minutes. You're not in command anymore! We're talking about lives here. Give me five minutes, then seal the tunnel. Yes, sir. (Sam) Don't wait for me. [All screaming] Michelle. [Speaking Moldavian] [All screaming] Sam. [Sam whispering] Stay down. [Speaking Moldavian] [Grunting] Michelle. I'll take you out of here. Seal the tunnel. Yes, sir. Fire in the hole! [Men screaming] Geller is dead. The Satphone's out. We're cut off. They knew we were coming. They had to. Did we scan everybody? Everyone who passes the security post. But it wasn't manned. (man) Amirev. He's still alive, sir. (operator on radio) This is Delta 13, we are en route. ETA is one hour. Over. Mr President. (Amirev) Sir. We believe the militia may have planted a listening device on someone. They made sure it was someone who made it inside. Check my men, please. (agent) Clean. Sir, is there any chance that someone in your office could have planted one on you? Anything is possible. Do you mind? (Amirev) Please. Nothing. So, that's everyone. No. Not everyone. [Beeping] [Detector blaring] [Detector blaring] [Sighing] Deactivated. It's one of ours. Tavarov has heard everything within 10 feet of you. [Sighing] Oh. How's your head? Mild concussion. Sam, I, uh... Sometimes, life forces you to make a tough call, Michelle. But those people... Those poor people. I know. That's history. Maybe it sounds cold, but that's history. You have to survive to write about it, okay? I'm sorry I ever doubted you. [Sighing] Michelle, they'll come at us with everything they've got. I need to handle this. Eight marines left. How's the morale holdin' up? We've got 10 motivated bad-asses, Gunny, just itchin' to bring a world of pain to these motherfuckers. Copy that. Time to get down and dirty. Keenan wants claymores. You get a staffer to pass these around. I want metal, keys, coins, knives, nails, and I want them back here, full, in five minutes. Yes, sir. [Sighing] You were looking for me? Sir, I feel I should be relieved of my command. Officially I don't work here, remember? We've got Tavarov. On four. You take it. As far as he and I are concerned you're in charge here. Sam Keenan. (Tavarov) Mr Keenan. You can end this with no further loss on either side. Release President Amirev now, and your people will leave our country unharmed. The marines and a shit load of tanks are heading your way. (Sam) Over. When they get here, they will be dealing with a new government. Out. Baldwin, are the civilians in the basement? Yes, sir. How are we looking? Bad news, sir. Our perimeter's full of holes. And the good news? Good news? We gonna teach these mothers a whole new meaning of pain. Give them hell, Gunny. That's an order. Yes, sir. Happy 4th of July, gentlemen. I suggest you make full use of the right to bear arms. Got to love that Second Amendment. What you doing here? Sightseeing. Michelle, go to the basement. I would, but Mike said he can't find a decent camera angle down there. Yeah, that, and the lighting sucks. Intelligent, beautiful, stubborn. Nice mix. (militia officer on radio) Sir, should we wait? No. Attack. Redwood One to Redwood Two. They're positioning to attack. Get ready. Copy that. At code Baker, followed by your number, hold your fire. (Gunny on radio) We lure them into the open area, at which point I will give them their motherfucking bonus. And we all open up with everything we've got. Over. Over. Here we go! [Men shouting in Moldavian] Come on, hurry, hurry. This way. Quicker. Go, go. (Baldwin) Come on, keep moving. Come on, move. Get everyone in the corner over here. [All shouting] General Borgov is on the secure channel. [Guns continue firing] [Both screaming] [Men talking in Moldavian] [All shouting] Baker Three, Baker Five, Baker Seven. We're getting in deep. Stand down. [Exclaiming] [Screaming] [Exclaiming] [Glass shattering] (Borgov on walkie-talkie) Tavarov, this is General Borgov. We are nearing your position, and I am ordering you to stand down. The Army's back. Withdraw now. Move back, move back! [Guns continue firing] Mr Keenan. Your cavalry has arrived. (Tavarov) You are lucky. (Gunny) Baker Six, Baker Six. There is a cease-fire. Militia is falling back. I repeat, militia is falling back. Binoculars. [Vehicles approaching] General Borgov's regiment. They made it. (all) Ooh-rah! Ooh-rah! Congratulations to your brave marines. At last, I can release you of this burden and return to the Presidential Palace. General Borgov is a personal contact. It would be a great honour, Mr President, if I could take his report first hand. Very well. Thank you. John, I sense a juicy photo op coming up. Redwood One? Tell your girlfriend to get her cameras fired up. (Baldwin) Over. Copy that. In the nick of time, General. (Borgov) Good to see you again. Thank you for coming, sir. This is Birch One. Militia forces have cut and run. The government square is secured. Please tell President Amirev his people await his return. Out. (man) Yes! [People chattering] Oh, shit. Redwood Three. Return to compound. (Marine #2) The Army's in on this. Fall back, fall back! Get down! [Exclaiming] [Grunting] [Groaning] Move. [Gasping] Get the President back into the bubble. Now. Come on. [Screaming] [Michelle exclaiming] [Man shouting] (Marine on radio) Anaconda Six to US Embassy. Do you read me? Over. This is Redwood One, say again. I do not read you. Over. Anaconda Six. Do you read me? What's your sit-rep? Over. We've got tanks in front of the Embassy, pounding the crap out of us. Copy that. Will return the favour. (Marine on loudspeaker) This is the United States Army. Stand down, lower your weapons, or you will be fired upon. [Helicopter blades whirring] Go. Here. [Screaming] [Speaking Moldavian] [Screaming] I'm out. Get out of here! Sir. [Screaming] Where's Sam? [Panting] [Whimpering] Don't think about it. Do it. Seal this room, soldier. Yes, sir. Keep everybody over the other side, now. (Marine) Okay. Sir, Miss Whitman's not in the TCU. [Baldwin screaming] [Both grunting] [Tavarov speaking Moldavian] [Exclaiming] [Groaning] [Screaming] Here! [Tavarov screaming] [Groaning] Private, bring that stretcher. Move! (Marine) Medic! (Marine) Come on. (Marine) Some help here. Thank you. Right this way, sir. Marine, who's in charge here? He is, sir. Commander Keenan. Sit, sir, sit. Let's get these civilians out of here. Go for it, Colonel. Aren't you coming with us? That's a no. You sure? Yes, sir. I'm not going anywhere. Sir.
