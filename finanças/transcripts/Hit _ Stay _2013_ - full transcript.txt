What I can talk about first is how I came to be here. and about the fact that they didn't tell us anything. They didn't tell us what it was other than the source that I had said this was going to be a big story. We knew that we were going to be covering some kind of a demonstration. We didn't know what it was, what the nature of it was, etc. and had no idea what we were doing out here. At this point, there were no big signs screaming "draft board." We didn't know what we had. Again, there was a sense that whatever was happening was already underway and that we'd better go quickly or we were going to miss it. We ran around, somewhat out of breath, around the side of the building, and that's when the cameraman, Bob Boyer, turned on his camera and you see the shaky footage, and you see, I believe it was John Hogan, who actually lit the match and started the fire. When we first got there, we had no idea what we were looking at. The first thing, obviously, you spotted immediately, was there were two Catholic priests there. Of course I recognized Phil Berrigan immediately, because he was a figure of some importance in the news in Baltimore at the time, and I recognized his brother, Dan. At the height of the Vietnam War, nine Catholics entered this white frame building in Catonsville, Maryland. It was a draft board. The nine, some of them Catholic priests, seized Selective Service files. They brought those files out onto this parking lot, and then burned them, with the help of homemade napalm. Of course, the striking thing about the Catonsville Nine, this wasn't your usual protest with scruffy anti-war demonstrators, young men trying to avoid the draft. The Catonsville action was nine Catholic lay people and clergy. I think that reached out to a community beyond the conventional anti-war activist. It made the Catholic community, no matter how conservative, question, because these were priests and former nuns. The idea about a hit and stay was to take responsibility for the action. It was to commit a civil disobedience, and that entailed sticking around and waiting to be arrested and suffering whatever legal consequences resulted. This was new. This was a new tactic. That was the most expressive, most mobilizing, thing I've seen as far as the anti-war movement was concerned. I had no idea that anybody had in mind that this was the prototype of some series of actions, and that I would be in the next one. It had a tremendous catalytic effect. The numbers in the streets that we could sustain from that moment on would have been impossible without actions like the Catonsville Nine and Baltimore Four. My brother was a perfect example. He graduated from high school. He was going to be a carpenter. He wanted to get a job. He had a girlfriend. He wanted an old Chevy car to have, and wanted to just have a regular old life. He couldn't have found Vietnam on a map if you'd paid him 20 bucks, probably. You were drafted, well, you went. It wasn't like he voluntarily chose to say yes, this is what I want to do. Did he want to go? I'm sure he didn't want to go. Did he see that there were choices and options? I'm sure he didn't see there were choices and options. He was the average age of the Vietnam casualty, 19-and-a-half years old, completely cannon fodder. When my brother was killed, I remember in going to school, I couldn't bring myself to wear a "Bomb Hanoi" button. I couldn't do that. Nor was I... had much of an understanding about the Vietnam War. When Kennedy came into office, I was at Fort Bragg in the 82nd Airborne in the Medical Company, and he created Special Forces. People in my company who wanted to make rank were transferring from the 82nd Airborne over to Special Forces, which was also at Fort Bragg. Then they were going to Vietnam. Kennedy invaded South Vietnam in 1962. That was after seven or eight years of establishing a Latin American style terror state in the late '50s, which had probably killed 70 or 80,000 people by then, something like that. But even then, back in 1961 and '62, guys coming back from Vietnam said to me, "They're winning the war. "They're winning the war with- "They're winning the war." And this was before large numbers of American troops had been committed. This was way before '64 and '65. There was that feeling in the early going, the domino theory. If Vietnam falls to the Communists, then other countries will fall like dominoes and Communism will spread its tentacles around the world. That seemed, at the time, a very real thing. Johnson, of course, was elected in the landslide, and even before the inauguration he started the bombing of Vietnam. Once you start down that path, it's pretty hard to back away from it, so instead, just a little more escalation, a widening of the war. Before you know it, instead of 3,000 dead, it's 5,000 and 10,000 and 20,000 and it just gets harder and harder and harder to admit, oh, well, I guess I'm wrong and by the way, the consequences of being wrong are 20,000 people killed. I believe we are in such times as make it increasingly impossible for Christians to obey the law of the land and to remain true to Christ. At that point, I was saying this is a terrible war, we shouldn't be fighting it, what can we do about it, feeling helpless, and also feeling why don't our Bishops, why doesn't the Pope, why doesn't the Catholic church speak out? As a woman at age 20, I had been watching all the young men that I know be drafted for the war, and I was like safe. There was nothing I could do. But suddenly I could say something with others about the war that was an alternative to war. Anti-war demonstrators protest US involvement in the Vietnam War in mass marches, rallies and demonstrations. I think that's one thing is people look back and think that, oh, everyone was in the peace movement, everyone was against the war then. You could be in places where everyone was against the war, but you were a little island. You stepped into real America, and it was a long time before there was a general consensus against the war. When you start to watch the intensity of the war building up and Johnson not regarding what the disposition of the population was as they viewed the war and kept escalating, it became clearer that the peace movement was being [unintelligible]. Johnson's greatest statement used to be that I don't care if those hippy, long-hair people walk with signs from Maine to California, I'm going to keep going on with the war. President Johnson meanwhile let it be known that the FBI is closely watching all anti-war activity. Let us pray. Our God of all universes, our parent God of all creation and all human life itself, we pray at this graveside of an only son. Forgive us for turning your gifts into weapons of mass and mini destruction. Point us away from evil, from harmful games and sport and human interaction and relationships that injure and even kill. Inspire and empower us to love as you love. Amen. My name is Reverend James L. Mengel. I'm actually the third. I was born just over the hill here. In a sense, I just offered my body, a warm body, and just went along with whatever they planned, and it ended up the Baltimore Four. The Baltimore Four, four people. Father Philip Berrigan, Jim Mengel, Tom Lewis and Dave Eberhardt. I was doing an errand and had the radio on in the car. The radio announcer spoke about these people who had poured blood on draft files in Baltimore, Maryland. The tone that the announcer took was so dismissive, as if this were the craziest thing in the world people could do. I heard it and I thought, I want to know more about why they did what they did. We went to the clerks and told them we wanted to look at the files. We had experience as draft counselors, so they let us go back. We had Mr. Clean bottles under our coats, which we had filled with blood. We proceeded to the files and doused them good. The clerks were very agitated and upset, of course. We just sat and waited until the guards came. With the blood pouring was to take responsibility for the action, after we poured the blood on records. We didn't try to escape. We waited for arrest. We used the trial as an educational medium. This was front-page news, and that's what we wanted. When I became United States Attorney, the last thing I expected to be involved in was this sort of prosecution. There was white color crime, there was corruption, they were the things that the US Attorney's Office had historically been doing. The prosecutions that involved protests of this sort were extremely rare in my experience. There's a higher law than the law that precludes this. We're obeying a moral law. There's precedence for this in American history. So they wanted a political trial. We're not talking about trials here in the normal sense of the word. Skill and examination of witnesses, objections that are appropriate. This was theater. This wasn't litigation in the normal sense. It was intended to be theater, that's why they did it. We agreed we were guilty of what took place, we felt it was for good purpose, and was a lot less violent and destructive than what the military was doing, and our nation. All of that stuff was just not relevant to whether they intended to pour blood on the records. They did, they admitted it, end of story. That's the law. The defense attorney was saying "Well, wait a minute, now. "There couldn't have been that much damage. "Why didn't you just clean off these files "and carry on business?" Oh, some of them were absolutely illegible. The guy says, "Well, so what? "Why didn't you just pull out duplicate copies "for these people?" The Colonel said, "Well, there are no duplicate copies." The attorney said, "Well, what do you mean? "If these files didn't exist, "that the person who's name is in the file "would no longer exist in the United States Draft Office?" He said, "Yeah." In other words, if I burned this draft file that that person, you wouldn't know who it was and you couldn't draft them? He said, "Right." Hello, I'm Marc Steiner and welcome back. It is Veteran's Day and we are reflecting on the notion of war and of peace in our world today. We're now joined in the studio by two men, one of whom was also an Army veteran, but where both men became known to the world, or at least part of the world, they were members of the Catonsville Nine. So George Mische, Tom Melville, welcome, and good to have you staying with us here for the first part of this program. Thanks for having us. You come out of a part of the Catholic church, both of you, that is fighting for peace and a different way of looking at the world, very much at odds with the Vatican view of where the Catholic church is and where the world is. And you were a priest for a long time. Yes, I was. And I still am according to Catholic doctrine. Right, sorry, right. I don't function as one anymore, so we use the word former priest. A brief history of the Catonsville Nine. Many people don't know what that is and who you all were and what that moment was in the middle of the Vietnam War; If you could explain that to us. All nine of us were Catholics. All of us had extensive backgrounds either internationally or nationally in the ghettos of America and Africa. We also were no longer draft eligible. We felt that something had to be done in this country to jar the protest movement to say there was something beyond just marching down the streets while Lyndon Johnson kept the war going. Everyone came from a different place in their mind as to the reason for their being there. Mary Moylan had participated in Africa and saw the same kind of thing occurring. That's why she participated. George Mische was very interested because he'd been in the Dominican Republic. In coming back from Guatemala was the sole focus at that time of my participation in the action at Catonsville. As I saw what the United State did in Guatemala, I saw that was a democratic government we overthrew. We felt with the Vietnamese almost like we felt with the Guatemalan's because it was a similar kind of situation where you're fighting against peasants in the countryside and all they want is freedom to work their land and raise their families. Our superior gave myself, my brother, and this nun who is now my wife, Margarita, he gave us tickets to fly back to Maryknoll. It was specifically Maryknoll who asked us to leave. They were afraid of the repercussions of our being involved with this. So we were told to leave tomorrow. We decided if our vocation, our mission, our dream of living in Guatemala for the rest of our lives was ending, then we weren't going to go back to Maryknoll and be sent off to Hawaii or Taiwan or South Korea where we have other missions, and that we would follow up on what we had done. I left Guatemala at that time, too, because my superiors sent me out of the country because I had known them and some of the things they had talked about doing. When we had the meting in our house in Washington, deciding to do the Catonsville action, the Melvilles, of course, and Hogan were living with me and my wife in D.C. People say a lot of things and I was so dizzyingly in love... Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, honey, of course. But when he told me what he was going to do, you know, there I am, eight months pregnant with Danielle. He said, "Shit." I was, to put it mildly, upset. They did the action between the trial for the Baltimore Four and the sentencing for the Baltimore Four. The trial was going on at that time, and George told us about it. We decided to go down, then, to meet Phil Berrigan. Phil was trying to recruit more people than nine. He felt the bigger the better. We want a cross-section of America. I guess he felt that this should be people who are middle class, fairly privileged, well regarded by society. That was his theme for who should be acting to commit civil disobedience. - I - was sitting at my desk doing my work and these two ladies were in the with me, and those two gentlemen came up in the hall outside there and I said, "Yes, sir, may I help you?" With that, then all the rest of them came, all of a sudden, quickly. One man with the trash burner, he went around to my files and stood there and started dumping files into this trash burner. I saw them coming out of the building. I saw them sort of tumbling out and running around the corner of the building. They dumped them on the lot and they threw this napalm on and it went whoop, like that, I mean, it really exploded. Everyone jumped back. I would say it was roughly in this area to the rear, just far enough away, they were going to light a fire. And then they stood around. They stood around and Pat was interviewing them and they were talking amongst themselves They were praying and waiting for the Feds to show up. We make our prayer in the name of that God whose name is peace and decency and unity and love. We unite in taking our matches, approaching the fire. We're all a part of this. While people throughout the world, and especially Vietnam now, are suffering from napalm, these files are also napalmed to show that the [unintelligible] Amen. Napalm, which was made from information and from a formula in the United States Special Forces Handbook published by the School of Special Warfare of the United States. We all had a hand in making the napalm. It was used here today. Napalm is a very old weapon. It goes back to the Byzantines. It really came to public attention during the war in Vietnam, the pictures of napalmed people. That was the kind of quintessential symbol of the war. We were burning babies, literally, in Vietnam. That's why we wanted to come up with something symbolic, and also something that would really destroy the files. Our church has failed to act officially, and we feel that as individuals we're going to have to speak out in the name of Catholicism and Christianity, and we hope by our action to inspire other people who have Christian principles or a faith similar to Christianity will act accordingly to stop the terrible destruction that America is wrecking on the whole world. We regret very much, I think all of us, the inconvenience and even the suffering that we brought to these clerks here. We sincerely hope we didn't injure anyone. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. We have chosen to be powerless criminals in a time of criminal power. We have chosen to be branded as peace criminals by war criminals. We'll take them to the station. Ready the back of the paddy wagon. One, two. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. What would you say is going to happen to your office here? Has this seriously disrupted your service? Yes, yes, it has seriously disrupted it. It really has. It's going to take hours and hours and hours of intense hard labor to reconstruct and bring back all of these. It's doing a great injustice to the boys themselves because many instances, these boys have gone to a lot of trouble to get doctors' statements, which cost them a lot of money. These things are all inside of these files. It certainly was much more of a news even than the Baltimore Four had been. Why that was so, I'm not sure. Maybe the fact that there had been this previous action. Maybe that, I think Dan Berrigan was more well-known than Phil, and that may have been a factor. If you're going to get involved with a movement and there's priests involved, back then in '68, they're going to cover the priests. Because before us, at least in this century, that kind of thing had not happened. But there was a nonviolent explicit attack upon property as an attempt to vindicate human life in the midst of, say, the idolatries paid to property and the absolute cheapening of human life that war spells. Look, it was a very courageous action, and like other civil disobedience... Civil disobedience is a tactic, it's not a principle. The point of the tactic is, I think, at least, is to encourage others to move a little farther. So if we go this far, maybe other people will think about it and be inspired and they'll do a little more than they're doing. There were very mixed reactions to Catonsville. A lot of people were totally mystified, some scandalized, some confused, some angry. They felt perhaps that pure principles of nonviolence had been violated. We destroyed property at Catonsville and people got very, very flustered over that. They forgot about the destruction of human beings, but they say they got violent over property and they burned those papers. But when property is destroyed, and a lot of it deserves to be destroyed in order to illustrate the way it is employed to abuse and to kill and maim human beings. Not only in this country, but in the modern world, we have this fetish about property, about things, much more than we have about people. People are more important than pieces of paper. People were being burned and killed. There was a sense of immediacy about it, that of course draft records are hunting licenses. Some property, since it doesn't bring anything good for a human being, that property might not have a right to exist. When it came around to being, to the trial period, which was in late 1968, in October, we had reporters from Europe and other places coming in. It was a big news story. We were about publicity. We knew that this was drama, this was not just politics. This was politics as theater. There was a very, very big march from Wyman Park right down Howard Street. At that time, Howard Street was the main shopping street in the city. The only thing I can tell you in terms of numbers is that once we got downtown in front of City Hall, we filled the War Memorial Plaza. That plaza in front of City Hall literally was full of people. I remember speaking to it. To my knowledge it was the first time that the Baltimore police broke out riot gear. It was very intimidating, it was very real, but there was also a sense that they were between the counter-demonstrators and the demonstrators, so there was a level on which you could be grateful for them being there. And I could knock the hell out of you right now. I didn't say you couldn't. You wouldn't believe that, would you? I was very, very concerned that there not be incidents, there not be violence, that police and the marshals not overreact. I've always been very proud of the fact that there were no, zero, arrests during the entire week of the protests. It was surprising how many people came and more or less lived in Baltimore throughout the trial. There was a kind of festival atmosphere almost. The trial, of course, was by definition unusual in the sense that the defendants admitted every element of the charge. That's not what happens in criminal cases. What these folks wanted to do is to demonstrate to the public the reasons, the motive, for their conduct, and indirectly to try the war. They had a right, they said. They were asking to be acquitted. This wasn't just... They pleaded not guilty. There's a concept called jury nullification. It's what Kunstler actually sought to argue to the jury, to tell the jury to disregard the judge's instructions, which were, in effect, if these elements are met, they're guilty. We refused to do anything with the jury selection. We just said you charged us, it's your trial, you pick who you want. If I recall right, there was one juror who was black, all the rest were white. When they presented their case we made no objections. We let them do whatever they wanted. Judge Thompson was more tolerant, more liberal you can say, in permitting the defendants to explain why they did what they did. There was always the sense they can talk, and they can talk, and they can talk, but we know what the outcome of this is going to be. He knew from the get-go they were going to be convicted. On the last day of the trial I was in the room when the verdict was delivered, so I heard, I believe it was Tom Melville's brother, stand up and say, "Ladies and gentlemen "of the jury, you've just found Jesus Christ guilty." The Federal sentence was 24 months and because I behaved myself, I got out after 18 months. I had a two year sentence, which was then reduced to one year, and then on the one year with good time and all that stuff, it's a little over nine months that I served in prison. I've often said in giving talks to people that were considering doing some kind of civil disobedience and being worried about prison, I'd say, "Listen, if you're a nun or a priest, "you've been through the convent, "you've been through the seminary, "it's perfect training for being in prison." We had a big farewell party the night before they were to report. We said goodbye and all, and they just led us on. Then, of course, when we went to the court in the morning, most of the folks weren't there. We, naively, thought they must be coming, they must be coming. Then it dawned on us, they're not coming. When it came time to turn ourselves in, we decided to continue the action, take some more risk by going underground. Let them try and catch us. Mary Moylan knew that we were going to do that and said, "I think I'm going to join you, "but do you mind if I go under with the women?" because she wanted to show that the women were as good of revolutionaries in the sense as the men, and I thought it was a great idea. Did you spend any time underground or avoid turning yourself in after-? No. I did not. I was newly married and I wanted to have that over with, go to jail, and get it over with. I had been celibate long enough. They got Phil and George and Dave fairly quickly, but it took a while to get Dan, and they never got Mary, and they were looking for Mary because they were here many times, not only here at this house looking for her, but our neighbor as well. I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president. Not only am I not religious but I find religion to be distracting and kind of a bummer. These folks are different for a lot of reasons. One is because they carry out their politics and their faith and their moral principles in action. It's the action that makes their principles come to life. I think the Catonsville Nine opened up the options of what people were willing to do and it made people really reflect on the killing that was going on abroad and what a person or a group could do. Between the trial of the Catonsville Nine and the time the group went underground, Phil especially, and George, Dan to a degree, went to retreats, meetings, recruiting, organizing more actions. With people like Mische around, especially in the second trial, it was about every time you have a trial you organize another action. At least another action, one other action. I took off, decided not to stay at home in D.C. but to go out and keep the ball rolling. I went through a whole series of cities meeting with people with the idea of getting to New Jersey in August of 1968 to decide how to carry this on. Quite a few of the participants of what was later to be the Milwaukee 14 action, were at that retreat. I was turned on by the idea of a small group of folks doing a disciplined, public, scary event. I just really liked the idea of it. The step from descent to resistance is a very great step. Everything up to that point from letter-writing to visiting Congressmen, that's a pretty clear continuum. But then to step into the area of resistance, say through a burning of draft cards and receiving draft cards, that's a much tougher step to take. The question was when I would be involved in the movement. I remember talking to somebody in the seminary, a priest, and he said, "How do you see your "life in the upcoming years?" I said, "I'll eventually be in jail." He said, "Oh, that's interesting." In Milwaukee, there was electricity here. I met with all kinds of groups, and finally Mike [Cullen] says, "Have you decided where the next action should be?" I said, "That's for people to decide themselves." It began to seem like maybe there should be an action in Milwaukee because there were nine draft boards for the whole city on one floor of one office building downtown. It would be a chance to take out the files of all the city draft boards. It might actually stop the draft in one American city. We had 14 people, from different parts of the country, who decided on a day, and committed civil disobedience. We had gotten together on Labor Day weekend for the first time and this action was not much more than three weeks later. We ran out of the building with all our files and threw them at a war memorial. They burned draft records to protest the Vietnam War, and became known as the Milwaukee 14. It was a dramatic action. It was a kind of theater, a moral theater, and like any piece of theater, it catches everybody's attention. They entered Milwaukee's Selective Service Office, dragged out the files, and torched them, right there, on Wells Street. After the flames, they hugged, sang hymns. No one ran; all were arrested. Fire engines got there pretty quick. It was a good sized blaze. Hallowed be Thy name. We love all of you gentlemen who are putting out the fire. We have done this because we love America. and believe America has done wrong in the last days in Vietnam. The [unintelligible] years we've lost 27 or 26,000 American men. We've lost 100,000- May those young men whose files were burned here never go to war. The amazing part about it all is we could have disappeared and nobody would have found us again. They would have always wondered who it was that did it, but instead of running, we decided to stay. The police were very kind. They didn't treat us if we were dangerous people. We were completely cooperative. This is part of what we were doing. We'd come to be arrested for impeding the operation of the Selective Service System. Our trial was a state trial and we were charged and convicted with burglary, arson and theft. We felt that we had much more [breath] without a lawyer. We had Bill Kunstler as our lawyer, and said, "Well, Bill, we're going to handle this on our own." Basically it was more so that we could talk because it was much more difficult to shut up the defendant than it was a lawyer or a witness. We already knew we were going to jail. were convicted of arson and burglary, and each did just about a year in jail. Today, March 22, 1969, in the Washington office of the Dow Chemical Company we spill human blood, it was our own, and destroy files and office equipment. By this action, we condemn you, the Dow Chemical Company, and all similar American corporations. In your mad pursuit of profit, you and others like you, are causing the psychological and physical destruction of mankind. Our action was the first to venture into the military industrial complex issue of the war. Dow made napalm, nerve gas, and defoliants that were used in Vietnam. We wanted to show that the corporations are making a lot of money on the Vietnam War. We were across the street wondering what's going on here, and suddenly we're seeing windows being shattered and documents being thrown out into the street. We went up into the building and got inside and saw ransacked offices, etc. We committed five Federal felonies. That was my little claim to fame, to be the first nun in the United States to commit a Federal felony. My understanding is that the so-called hit and stay, or the stand-around actions that followed, resulted in at least tens of thousands of draft files being destroyed. There were over 100 draft board actions in this country, and the Director of the Selective Service acknowledged that these actions had really undercut their ability to operate. The culmination, in my mind, was in Chicago when the Chicago 15 went into the ghettos of the South Side Chicago and burned up to half a million draft files, because Vietnam was mainly being popped by blacks and Latinos in this country while white kids could go to college and- At least wealthy white kids. As long as you could get into college you got your draft deferment. They hit 34 draft boards all in one South Side Selective Service complex. They burglarized the draft board over the weekend, but still stood around. Beaver 55 did a raid on the Dow Chemical plant in Midland, Michigan with magnets to erase computer data tapes that purportedly included the formula for napalm. The Boston Eight was the first time to hit multiple buildings in one night. John [Galvani] and I were assigned to watch the Copley Square Building, and we were assigned to make a accurate record of the light patterns in the building. We did weeks and weeks and weeks of casing of those draft boards in order to figure out ways of getting in and out. During the Copley Square action, I realized that the entire evening with John [Galvani], we were watching the wrong building. We drew maps of each of the offices. We knew where the files were located and where the different parts of the cross reference system were kept, and we meant to do a very careful, complete, comprehensive job of making those draft boards inoperable and unable to function in any way. We had agreed that we were going to surface a week later at the Moratorium in Washington D.C., and we invited the press to that, and the FBI were there as well. They joked with us, but did not attempt to arrest us. On the [We the People] action is a real turning point as far as youth being involved. Youth were taking it over. Priests and nuns were becoming scarce. The youth that were involved may or may not have had any religious connection. The whole state of Delaware was supposed to be taken out in one night. The decision was made that we would hang platforms above the acoustical ceiling in the bathrooms. [And] sat up there for quite a while. We knew when the janitor left and we walked in and we started our action. We had with us a bunch of inflatable swimming pools, kids' swimming pools. And then we rushed to get wastepaper cans, water, fill them up, pour in the bleach, and then started dumping filed into them. The New Haven action was a clear hit and run. The folks who were in the building took a lot of files out. And the records were returned to the men with a letter and said, "Here's your record. "You're no longer on record. "It's up to you. "We hope you make the right choice." We decided it would be good if they were mailed from different cities up and down the coast. Vandals invaded two draft board offices in Elizabeth and Union City, New Jersey early this morning. We planned and we decided not to get arrested. I as scared shitless. They destroyed thousands of 1A files and painted anti-war slogans on the walls. And I believe about 300 people signed the statement saying that they were responsible for the Hoover Vacuum conspiracy, and we sent that to the FBI; and never heard back from them. We went to Vietnam, not to destroy freedom, but to defend it. We went to Vietnam, not as an aggressor, but to stop aggression. History will record that the American effort in Vietnam was a good cause, honorably undertaken, and honorably ended. You think there's still work for the anti-war movement? I would say there's perhaps more work than there ever has been. Phil Berrigan had been an officer in the military; he was used to leading many. He'd gotten a battlefield commission in infantry. Phil still, in my experience of him, and I had known him well for a number of years, tended to operate like an officer. I'd been in the military, and I was familiar with that. Phil would kind of get in your face about doing an action like this. It was leadership skills. You challenge people to do something, to rise to the occasion. Well, it's kind of inevitable in a celebrity-run culture that people will be picked out and identified as leaders, but, yeah, it's a negative factor. I certainly never thought of them as leaders, so to speak. That's the media. It's a great story. Two priests, brothers, resisting the war. One was in the Army, all this kind of stuff. There's a lot of us that did probably more actions than Dan Berrigan ever did. I don't know about Phil because he was always doing something. But the media loves that stuff, so they'll pick someone as the leader, so to speak, and run with it. Phil had always laid onto us this big message that if you're really serious, capital S, about resistance, capital R, you will not get married. He would encourage a layman to stay single. I thought he put me into a rational, logical box where I had no response other than to say, "Sure, I'll do this." My experience with Phil was quite the opposite; that he was skeptical of my participation because of my youth. He questioned me pretty thoroughly when we first met because he was concerned that I wasn't ready for jail. But of course it made sense from Phil's point of view that if you really wanted to spend the rest of your life off and on in prison, resisting, then of course, obviously, you wouldn't want to be married and have children. He wasn't saying what it God telling you? He wasn't saying God. He was implying it because what's the only right thing to do in these circumstances, and that would be what God would want you to do. It was a kind of macho challenge and indeed most of the people responding to this in the early actions, not all but most, were men. It's hard to recount now how stifling the atmosphere was at that time for women coming up with anything on their own. When women stepped out and tried to do something that was self-identified, there was resistance to it, and that was certainly true with ours as well. We decided that it would be important to try and do something that was distinctively women against the war, against the Vietnam War. What the women did in New York in the Women Against Daddy Warbucks was an experiment in using something other than fire to destroy draft records. We knocked out, as we used to say then, 13 draft boards that encompassed all of northern Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens. They were actually the first ones that came up with the delayed standby. We went into the draft boards on the night of July 1, and then we appeared in Rockefeller Center July 3. Having summoned, invited, anybody who wanted, police, newspaper reporters, television reporters, etc. Because a lot of corporations are headquartered in Rockefeller Center, we decided that would be a good place to appear and to have it be an event. One of them began tossing in the air what appeared to be torn strips of draft records. It was then the Federal agents moved in. The confetti was a different kind of thing than fire. Pat Kennedy, as soon as she was there, was immediately grabbed by about 10 FBI agents who lifted her up in the air and carried her horizontal out through the crowd, or tried to. Before it was over, six women were arrested by the FBI. There was a Grand Jury that was summoned. The investigation, our lawyers came to believe the purpose of the Grand Jury was to subpoena me and give me immunity in order to get access to the larger draft board community. As a result, I made a decision to disappear for a while and not be findable in terms of a Grand Jury subpoena. It was a refreshing action. It came right toward the beginning of that era of the women's movement, so there were a lot of women around the country that loved it. How many kids did you kill today, Empire USA? How many kids did you kill today, Empire USA? Pots of gold are in your grip. You pray they'll never, ever slip. You're sending more soldiers again and again To make sure the wars will never end. How many kids did you kill today, Empire USA? I'm Joan Nicholson and I took part in the New York Eight action. They raided several draft boards in Queens and several draft boards in the Bronx. There was not an arrest as they did the action. They did what they came to call surfacing. They were having a press conference and they knew the Feds were going to be coming. They started to talk with one of the attorneys who came, and he said, "Well, why don't you "just sort of say you claim responsibility "and not say you actually did it "and don't answer any questions "about did you do it or not?" We were taken sort of into custody, I guess, apprehended by a Bronx, I guess it was a DA, and then a bit later we were called before a Grand Jury. They wanted to know who had been in which place. Since they couldn't determine who had been where, nothing ever happened. That was very nice. That, I think, completed the evolution from standby actions, which took place on weekdays during normal business hours in broad daylight where people stood by and waited for the police to arrest them, to this format of surfacing later, often without evidence, as a way of, perhaps, thwarting government prosecution. There's no question that you're not just kind of politically, in terms of the priests and the nuns and the rest of us, being willing to do this and the publicity that came with it. That was a very important piece of what this movement was about, but it also had a practical impact in terms of physically impeding the ability of Selective Service to meet its quota, it appears. During the time he was in hiding, Father Berrigan changed his location often. He stayed with 37 different families in 10 eastern and Midwestern cities. Father Dan, you've been underground for some time now. What's it like to be underground in the United States of America? Well, I'd say that it looks as though it could go on forever, it looks good enough, looks useful enough for the movement. I'd say there were, what, four months that we looked for Dan everywhere. He was everywhere and available to everyone except the FBI. Probably so far as I'm concerned, the one hero of the entire movement, the person with the perspective, the knowledge, the ability to do the organization was John Grady. I met John in '68 at the Catonsville Nine trial. One of the things I remember about figuring out what John had been doing with the actions before he and I had been talking about doing New York Eight, Mike Dougherty, who was in the DC Nine action, Mike Dougherty's throwing these documents out of it looked like a fourth story office in Dow Chemical. The guy who's collecting the papers on the ground, on the street, is John Grady. John was very important as to a catalyst, as to insight, as to ideas. He really had a very steady vision in one direction, and that was serving the poor and looking at their plight and so on. He died just two months before Phil did in 2002. He was very close to Phil, so I'm sure Phil was in communication with John all the time. He certainly became a source for logistics for subsequent actions. He filled that void, there's no doubt. In my junior year of high school I was arrested with some folks at the Boston Army Base where we were passing out leaflets urging people to not take part in the Vietnam War and to resist the draft and stuff. I was sentenced to 20 days in jail for that while I was still in high school. When we heard of the Catonsville Nine, we thought, "Hey, what a great idea!" I was first involved in the Boston Two, myself and Frank [Famia] raided the draft board in the Customs House Tower in Boston. Frank and I were both given an indefinite zero to six years under what was then called the Youth Corrections Act. By the time Suzie got out of prison, there had been this evolution that we talked about away from standby actions. Suzie, in considering and contemplating her next draft board action, wanted to learn about casing and advance planning and cross-reference system. My involvement with the Rhode Island Political Offensive for Freedom, or RIPOFF, which was very clever, it was as a helper, someone who was not going to be surfacing with Jerry and David. We went into the Rhode Island Selective Service complex, it housed four local draft boards, and the Rhode Island state headquarters. We now know that those draft boards never drafted again. Then on the following Friday, Dave [Chaws] and I held a press conference in downtown Providence. We distributed a statement to the press that was carefully worded to say we claim responsibility for this draft board action. We did not say we did it or we were there. Jerry Elmer and David [Chaws] were both arrested as planned. None of those of us who had lend a hand during the action were arrested for it. The FBI had expressed skepticism that was reported in the press, saying those two guys couldn't be the only people responsible. It was much too professional a burglary for it to be just these kids. We, of course, took that as a great compliment. You have to remember that Dave and I were both 18 years old at the time, doing a major burglary of a Federal office complex was something that required a bit of doing. This was not a Catholic left action. The two people who surfaced were a couple of Jewish kids from New York. Yes, it had the benefit of Catholic left training in more ways than one. One was my experience came from the Boston Eight action, and that clearly was a Catholic left action. And, as you say correctly, Art Melville helped us with planning and he was a priest in the middle of the Catholic left. Decourcy and I were the ones that originated the planning for the Flower City Conspiracy. We had the idea of, hey, let's do a draft board action right here in Rochester. As things progressed in 1970, that was Kent State, that was the invasion of Cambodia, people being killed at Jackson State, we started discussing doing a draft board action at the four draft boards in Rochester, and then along the way of that discussion, we started expanding our look at the US Attorney's Office, which was prosecuting the draft cases of the people who were resisters, and at the FBI, which we felt was very responsible for trying to repress the movement for social change. It was J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. They were clearly acting on behalf of the war-making government. There was all kinds of illegal surveillance against totally legal activities. This was the first time an FBI office had ever been hit and their idea was that they didn't want to destroy the files, they wanted to make them public. The reason we did the action at the US Attorney's Office was that there was a very strong person within our group who had actually been in prison, and she saw the kind of racial and class realities of the prison system, how it discriminated against people of color and poor people, low income people, and she wanted to make a statement that that's part of the problem, too. Four large urban draft boards plus the FBI office plus the Assistant US Attorney's Office, we needed a lot of people power. There was Suzie Williams, Decourcy Squire, Wayne [Bonekemper], Joanie Nicholson, Jane [Myerding], Ted Glick, Joe [Gilchrist], and Frank Calahan. That's the way it looked after we were done. Kind of in the middle of the night, might have been Decourcy, I remember coming and telling me and other people, that there were police coming up to the front door, checking the door to see if anybody had broken in. We realized they were doing it like on the half hour, so we called back to our people who were going to be picking us up and we told them, look, you should plan to come like 5:15, because they're checking the doors every half hour. It was 5:15, maybe 5:20 when these cars were literally turning the corner to come down to pick us up. The police got there early and checked the doors, and they saw everybody crouching down right by the door waiting to be picked up, and that was it. We got arrested. They were actually knocking on the door and saying, "This is the police, let us in." Are they nuts? Of course we weren't going to let them in. They knew that we were doing the action. The knew when, where, etc. Despite it, we got into the building, we were in there for five hours. The four draft boards were successfully burglarized, the files were destroyed, the draft boards were rendered inoperable. Perhaps they thought they were keeping watch and just didn't keep watch enough. The trial was a big deal. It was a big deal certainly for Rochester. It was front page news every day of the trial's two weeks. We were not charged with burglarizing the FBI office because they did not want to talk about what it was that we had been taking from the FBI office. They got that all back and we didn't get to publish any of it so, I- That was very sad. We had a hung jury, 9-3 for conviction. They ended up coming back with guilty with a recommendation of leniency on all six of the felony counts. We're convinced that that's why we ended up getting a year to a year-and-a-half rather than maybe 5-10 years. We were certain that's what we were going to get, at least, given that it wasn't just Selective Service, it was FBI, it was US Attorney. We have a visitor. For reasons that will become obvious with a little reflection, it was not possible to anticipate his arrival amongst us in advance. I understand that you've got something planned for tomorrow. Do you want to tell us what that is? Well, it's a very simple little project. Tomorrow for the first time since I went underground, I'm going to preach in a church, in an urban church. I want to be with a group of worshiping Christians, not necessarily Catholics, and I want to refer to the New Testament, and I want to relate it to what we have done and to invite people in as practical and simple and direct a way as I know, to consider this, even though they are shocked by it. To present on an ordinary Sunday morning to fellow Christians the scandal of one who lives outside the law, the added scandal of one whose brother, also a priest, is in Federal prison, the first political prisoner in our history who was a priest. Do you sympathize with Father Berrigan's act of burning draft files and then running away from his jail sentence and appearing in situations like this in the underground? Oh, I see that- I didn't quite understand the facts in the case. That is why he- In other words, he should be in jail, is that the idea? That's right, he's got a jail sentence hanging over him. I can understand his point of view, thinking it is right to do those kind of things, but personally, I wouldn't do it myself. - I - do not sympathize with the burning of draft cards. I think that's very un-American. His is the kind of heroic witness that I wish I had the courage to do, but which seems so very removed from the kind of thing that a person can do and still function in middle class society. Apparently drove J. Edgar Hoover crazy, that here's this guy making fun of us, giving anti-war speeches, and we can't catch him. The anti-war movement, I think, hurt our war effort, and maybe even caused casualties and certainly, I think, lengthened the war, because our enemies, the Viet Cong, the NVA, they saw, wait a minute, there's people in America that aren't supporting this war, so maybe if we just hang in there long enough, we'll get what we want. I felt, we're at war, it was a honorable war, to keep an allied nation free from Communism. Because we didn't stick in there long enough, they became a Communist nation. I wasn't crazy about the anti-war people. I am a former Marine and a retired FBI agent. I retired from the FBI in 1998. I was with the FBI for 30 years, a little bit over 30 years. Media, Pennsylvania. The FBI had a resident agency there, which was out of the Philadelphia field office. What happened is one morning the guys came into the office and the guy turned the key on the door and the key kept going around and he said, "I think they got into our nickers." Opened the door and sure enough, the place had been burglarized. Media, Pennsylvania is a town outside of Philadelphia, where, as it turned out, the FBI counterintelligence program was located. This was the program, it's referred to as Cointelpro, which is short for Counter Intelligence Program. We would take a group, like the Ku Klux Klan, maybe the Black Panther Party, maybe the Weathermen, and we would figure they're going to do something against this country, we want to disrupt this group, make them less efficient. They were after unions, they were after all the people that were looking out for the poor, working class people, and middle class. For instance, we investigated on college campuses, because some of the people who were being investigated for the whole national security thing, you know, anti-war groups and so on. We had to find out who they were, and so on. These were various groups who were left-wing, were anti-war, were anti-racist, and were doing things around the country to organize people to stop the war in Vietnam. The US government set about to kill, infiltrate, play dirty tricks, create violence among different people, spread rumors from one to another. The FBI was spending considerably more time on radical leftist groups, anti-war groups, then he was on organized crime. So basic, we had to talk to a lot of people, basically investigate a lot of innocent people to determine some people who were actuary involved in something. One day there was a big, bulky package in the mail and I opened it and didn't know what I had. There was a cover letter from the Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI. They were FBI files; they were copies of files. Media, Pennsylvania was the moment at which those files were brought out and shown to the press, so the secret plan of the government was exposed. When CBS, ABC and NBC all got the hot document which said that Hoover sent out this letter to all the FBI offices in the United States, to all the agents telling them that the role of the FBI agents in the field is to make every person in America believe there is an FBI agent behind every mailbox. When that it, that was the beginning of the turnaround in the Congress and the public about Hoover becoming discredited. It became almost a personal thing for Mr. Hoover. They broke into my FBI office. Who did media? I don't know; nobody knows. A lot of people know. [A little] insane. People know and I've heard names, but nobody talks about it. Grady did media, well, nobody knows who did media, but a lot- I think that Grady did media. They had a pretty good idea who had done this, but they had no evidence. I think the FBI thought Grady did Media too. Sure, but they couldn't pin it down on him. It was front page news for a long time until the Pentagon Papers were released by the New York Times, and that took us right off the papers completely, because the Pentagon Papers was a bigger story. You're talking the fall of 1970. Catonsville Nine and Baltimore Four are in prison. They're serving their time. With all the different ways people tried to influence the United States to realize the folly of this war and the cruelty of this war and the murder this war was causing, no effect. There were tons of conversations about how do you return the war to the front pages of- and the front, the consciousness of the American people. The legal machinery of the Unites States government began to move today in the kidnap conspiracy case that involves Henry Kissinger, one of President Nixon's Chief advisers. The indictments were disclosed last night and they also charged that the accused conspirators planned to blow up the heating ducts of several Washington buildings, all as a means of protesting against the Indo-China war and forcing the government to bring it to an end. The indictment said the Reverend Philip Berrigan, now in a Connecticut prison for destroying draft records, was the leader of the conspiracy. Most of those who knew Anthony Scoblick a former priest, and Fathers Neil McLaughlin and Joseph Wenderoth, were surprised at their arrests. They appeared briefly in Federal court at Baltimore, then were taken to be arraigned at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where indictments were handed down. What they hoped for, I think, more than anything else was to accuse our movement of violence, and thereby discredit it. To attribute to kidnapping and bombing to priests who have neither the philosophy nor the resources to support such activity must spring from the desperation of men who have decided to stop at nothing in order to crush the anti-war movement. Phil was determined to have the movement move on in directions that we were discussing. One of those tings about that he wanted so dearly to go into those tunnels to find out what it was like. Phil Berrigan went down into heating tunnels in Washington. Phil did the talking and I walked along with him. We actually got into a room with a large amount of computers and we were looking to see whether there were connections to the heating tunnel system as a way to be able to break into that building later and cause some damage to those computers. What Phil wanted to do was to blow up heating tunnels. Charge was true. They never got to the point of actually going further than that. One of the conversations we had was a conversation, could you do something like a citizen's arrest of a high government official and film and them answering hard questions and release that. You don't have that conversation long before you say, no, you're compelling somebody else's freedom and therefore it's not non-violent. You can't do it. End of conversation. Not saying it wasn't talked about or approached, but it was no, period. That was it. Of course, how it got back to J. Edgar Hoover in December, well, that's obvious. The letters. Just, stupidly, letters I wrote to Phil about some of the things people were talking about, not realizing they were always monitoring his mail, but also, no matter how subtly you tried to say something, they're going to try to make something out of it. When the revelation came out of what they were really about, that was the shocker. That was across the board. Especially when you're sitting back and knowing that the government knows more about their relationship than we do. Basically love letters in disguise were being passed back and forth with a kind of anti-war, resistance overlay. I think more than anything else they were just love letters. And the fact that they were talking about actions that were being planned was a slap in the face of all of us. Like that one line I'll never forget, "Stringfellow is part of bro's next move." Well, you know what that meant, right? Because Dan was underground at the time. Next thing we know the Feds are at Stringfellow's place on Block Island arresting Dan. That's where they got it from, but she said a lot of little things in those letters. Do you have comment, Father, at all? Good to be here. What were doing out on Block Island? Well, I was writing and reading and meditating, exactly what I'll be doing in jail. What are your future plans? Resistance. Probably all that Liz was trying to do was to convince Phil that we were still thinking creatively about things we could do. But when you think creatively and you put it in writing and you send it to the FBI, basically, believe it or not they take it seriously! Capsulizing the whole case, it started with Boyd Douglas, who was an inmate doing a study release at Lewisburg, at Bucknell University. He was recruited by Phil Berrigan to take letters from he to Liz McAlister and back from McAlister to him. They caught him at it, so he agreed to be and informant for us. Boyd did hoodwink Philip Berrigan. Philip was always so suspicious of a number of things that it surprised me that he became so tight with Boyd Douglas. He desperately wanted to communicate with Elizabeth and so in some ways it was one of a self-fulfilling prophesy that if you get somebody who's volunteering to take letters in and out, that you tell yourself that somehow he's somebody to be trusted, because he wanted to be able to communicate. I used to warn Phil over and over, this is a setup. This is wrong, don't talk to this guy, don't send letters out to him, because doesn't it seem kind of crazy to you that of 3,000 inmates, a lot of people had a lot of college in them, that they select one guy who was a two-bit hustler, and that they're sending him out to Bucknell? He struck me as just being a very affable, likable, friendly guy. you could talk to about anything; intelligent. It was very much like having a conversation with you. No offense. No ominous or anything about him. He specifically gave us the information about a break-in in Rochester ahead of time, and they arrested a bunch of them. That was directly as a result of what Boyd told us. The indictment came down against eight people and everybody laughed at it. There were editorials in papers all over the country, and editorial cartoons all over the place. Knowing that most Americans are united against that war, the ■has embarked on a most tragic and outrageous course, to stigmatize millions of morally dedicated opponents of our military involvement in Indo-China as violent and deranged people. As we'll get into, I was a member of the Camden 28. I was born and raised on a small farm, one of ten kids, very low-key working-class life. Significant event in our family that I think was one of the seeds of much of the rest of my life was when my brother was drafted and subsequently killed in Vietnam. That kind of was the beginning of the process that jelled for my eventual finding my way towards the draft board community and the Catholic left and that sort of thing. There were some fits and starts. I think at one point, then, it became clear that the FBI was kind of snooping around. People were seriously talking about abandoning it, and they'd been working a long time on pulling something off. Some other people were saying we got to get out of here, the Feds are on to us. A Franciscan brother came to me and told me about a plan action and asked if I would like to be a part of it. That's Mike Giocondo? Mike Giocondo. Initially I said no. Then I thought about it and I said well, at least I could meet the people. I think Mike was actually complaining to Bob just as friend to friend, oh, I'm involved in this action and they're thinking about cancelling it. We've put so much time and effort in to it. That's when Bob, I think, basically volunteered himself and said, "Oh, I can help you guys with that." I met Bob Hardy and he was an uplifting strong bull of a guy, and give you a big bear hug. I liked him a lot. When Bob came, the action was kind of rejuvenated. He always had ropes, he had tools, he had hammers, he had this, he had know-how. Bob was making sure that we had better drawings than the draft board. Always seemed to have enough money to loan, because it takes money to pull these things off. He was giving credible moral support to the group. People really started to feel very good again about the action and the action coming off. Add to that the fact that the Feds had disappeared, it's like, wow, we're cruising now! It doesn't get much better than this. Camden was a five-story building. The boards were up on the fifth floor, in the back. How do we get to them? How do we get in them? How do we get the stuff out? Grady was a very strong personality. He definitely had a leadership role in Camden. This is when he came up with the binoculars and the maps and the division of labor and all this sort of thing. I don't think people had any idea how good he became in organizing actions and whatever. There were eight people inside, so how many would you need on the outside? A few car drivers and truck drivers and somebody back at the headquarters taking some radio and walkie-talkie stuff. Then all of a sudden, I just heard this loud noise of footsteps. That's when the whole building lit up at once and they just came out of the woodwork. Freeze, you're under arrest. One of the FBI guys marches into the office And they had us all flat on the ground and hands behind our back and handcuffed and all that. He goes, "One, two, three, four, five, six, where's what's-his-name, where's Couming, where's Doyle? Rosemary Riley was there, arrested, and she turns and says, "There's an informer in the group." As we looked around, we realized there was one person missing, and that was Bob Hardy, so it was clear to all of us right away who had turned us in. As it was, I was the only person in the office that day. Get a knock on the door. Tells me who he is, he's Bob Hardy. He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to do this. He didn't think it was right to break in the draft board, but he didn't want to get his friends in trouble. He was hopeful that the FBI would nip this in the bud and that his people, his friends, would get probation or something, or not really charged with anything real heavy. But, as things went on, it became apparent that the Justice Department wanted to have an actual break-in and arrest people during the break-in. We made hay out of that during the trial, because the first time somebody just tore the first file, they could have arrested all of us on the same charges. That's it. And they waited for us to destroy hundreds of files? I said, "Well, who are the other people "in the group?" He said, "Well, there's the leader of the group. "I don't know his name, but I can find that out." Arranged for a way for me to- He was working like a carnival booth at a fair or carnival or something, so that night, I went over and he handed me a piece of paper that said, "The leader "of the group is John Peter Grady." I go back, send in my teletype, and it's like the pinball machine. This is the guy! It was obvious that the Feds believed that John Grady was behind Media and maybe other people. They wanted to catch those people and they were hoping that we would go in the FBI office in this building in Camden, which was just up the hallway from the draft board. Buffalo happened on the same night as Camden. Right before we were getting ready to go into the Camden draft board, I think I finally just turned to somebody and said, "You know, isn't it ironic that after all this time "of fits and starts and ups and downs, "that Buffalo's happening at the same night we are?" Shortly after that, Bob Hardy made some comment like, you know, I have to go and call Peg. From the way we understand it, he called the FBI and said, "There's something happening up in Buffalo." We went after the draft board records with a vengeance. You know, one of the boards we went in and we removed all the 1s and all the As from the typewriters so that no, no one should be classified as a 1A and a target for being shipped to Vietnam. So, symbolic things like that. The trial eventually happened about a year later in the spring of '72. We had great lawyers. Dear God, you go through the list of lawyers, Paul [Edward], New York City; Ramsey Clark, former Attorney General, good God; Leonard [Boudine], Constitutional lawyer. There were about 31 people who were subpoenaed from all over. That was part of it. It was like they went pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick. This case was extremely dangerous. The people could still be in prison, practically. We were these very threatening people. I remember one comment of the prosecutor: "These people are a greater threat "to the security of this nation "than is organized crime." He said that in open court. The policemen would say would it were so. It's not so. The Berrigan brothers never rose to that prominence, I guarantee you. I often said, if they had known how little attention we were paying to them, they would have been hurt, because they were very paranoid about us. We had all our criminal cases to work on. We weren't bothered with chasing after them. We all agreed that we wouldn't talk We would plead the Fifth or we would do whatever we had to do not to talk to the Justice Department about what we did or didn't do or what we heard or didn't hear. The only thing we had was the letters themselves, and Boyd's testimony. At the close of the prosecution's case, I stood up and said three things, none of which were particularly appropriate legally. I said the defense insists upon their innocence, that they oppose this war and always will, and the defense rests. Oh my God, the press just ran out of the room. We're like saying what's going on? One by one, then Paul [Edward] and Leonard [Boudine] said the same thing. The defense rests, the defense rests, the defense rests. So there was no defense witness called. There was no defense evidence put in. This is like Central Pennsylvania, all white jury, conservative area, and it was 10-2 for acquittal, so it was obvious that they just didn't have a case. As a trial, it kind of fizzled out, but it also, that kind of procedure, sort of demoralized us, if anything. It had nothing to do, ironically, with the FBI or whatever, it was the behavior of our own people. When the Harrisburg indictments happened, that definitely led to a whole kind of soul searching and a closer look at whether we should be continuing these and are there other options? I was put off, I was shocked. I was holding Phil up as a model, as a celibate priest. That was one of the reasons why I was continuing to stay in the Jesuits and be a celibate priest. Internally, amongst the Catholic left itself, which was a small group and everybody sort of knew everybody else, nobody knew about the letters going in and out except Elizabeth and Philip and Boyd Douglas and the FBI. The secrecy of the letters going in and out upset everyone. The handwriting was on the wall. They, in just political genius, that's what it is, figured out a way, and they did it. They just went, sliced it right in half. Right in half; it's interesting, isn't it? During when all of this is going on, Bob Hardy's son climbed a tree in Camden, fell out of the tree, fell across a spiked fence, was impaled across it. Mike Giocondo stopped by the hospital, Gene Dixon sto- These are people that he turned in. And he was surprised that so many of the Camden 28 community came out to the funeral and stuff like that. We were all there. It was like a wedding, because the Feds were on one side and we were on the other. He might have felt is God punishing me for get- Because this happened after the arrest, and of course the Camden 28 hung around him. He kind of took a different spin on things after a certain time. I've always made no bones about being a Christian man, being born again in Christ as well. I've been that since 1961. That's always led me in my walk. I started thinking about that and I thought, well, I think I better put something down on paper. Now we found out, of course. he was going to the Feds for the money and they were giving it to him. Basically they were saying keep this action going. Don't let this thing stop. If they need anything, let us know. We'll supply it. And they did. That's why he says in his affidavit that this action could not have come off without me and the FBI. It was a tremendous turning point because suddenly their star witness was our witness. He said, oh, it wouldn't have happened without me. It wasn't entrapment because they recruited him. They bragged about already having done these things. The group was kind of split down the middle. Some of us did not want to play on his role in it being an informant and giving us so much help. We put the Vietnam War on trial, clearly, and then we also put the FBI on trial. Then, of course, you had someone like Professor Howard Zinn coming up virtually quickly, but very clearly telling the whole history of civil disobedience in the US from the Boston Tea Party all the way through the Camden 28. Then he went on to talk about the Pentagon Papers. He went through this period where he started giving like a litany of what the American people had been told about the war and what the Pentagon Papers said about the war; and what the American people had been told about why we were there and what the Pentagon Papers said about why we were there; and what the American people had been told about the progress of the war and what the Pentagon Papers said. It keeps coming back over and over tin, oil and rubber. That's why we're there. Betty Good is sitting in the courtroom by the time. She had lost a son, Bob's brother, in that war. It was something that she needed to hold onto for herself, that her son died nobly, that her son died for good things, that her son died for democracy, that her son died for people. She said as she listened to Howard, she realized that he really did die for tin and rubber and oil, really nothing. If we're trying to save Vietnam from the Communists, we weren't trying to save the people. We were trying to save the tin, rubber and oil from the Commies, and that's all. She told Bob she wanted to take the stand the next day. My mom came in there and just absolutely blew them away from the heart with what it's like to lose a son. You could see her just getting worked up and righteously angry. The one point I remember is that she finally turned to the jury and like a stern middle-aged woman that she was who had gone through this horrible, horrible... and she just put her finger out and said, "It's our fault. "We're the ones who let them come "and take our kids 10,000 miles away, "and we're the ones that didn't say anything "and it's our fault." I mean, she was pissed and she was looking, and the jury's kind of like, whoa! She was just take no prisoners. Then she'd kind of compose herself and apologize. She just - This stuff came out. There wasn't a tear in her eye, but there was a tear in everybody else's eye. She just had this golden moment of this coming together, and she just spoke from the heart. I think that jury for the most part every one of them was opposed to the war by the time we finished the trial. and every one of them were sympathetic to what we had done. Without a doubt, John Grady's persistence in bringing up jury nullification, I believe, had its role. I remember being in the hallway while we were getting ready to go in to hear the verdict, and I think it was 48 years that they were facing if they were found guilty. I remember that moment, just sort of standing by myself at the edge of the hallway with a crowd of people around just thinking "48 years, wow." When they came in, and the jurors came in and the verdict came out, they were reading the verdict, and it was said, called out Buckalew's name. And then he said first count, which was destruction, I think, and not guilty. I said, "Holy shit!" [unintelligible], "Holy shit!" I said, "Hold it, now, hold it. "They still can get us on conspiracy." The second count was the conspiracy thing and they said, "Not guilty." Man. I will believe that we shall overcome- I thought it would be a hung jury. I didn't know any of the people except my son, and they're the most beautiful people in the world. I have to go back and convert my husband. Not only my husband, but my family. My husband's a good fellow, but he was too afraid to come today, because he was afraid, you know, the verdict would be bad. It was a break, and everybody admitted it. So it was a violation of the law. But I'll tell you what they did was nullify the law when they acquitted. The judge, appointed by Nixon, the judge allows the defendants to bring in all the witnesses they want, and the jury finds them not guilty even though they're caught red handed. When the verdict is announced, everybody in the courtroom stands up and sings "Amazing Grace," including the members of the jury. Then the foreman of the jury throws a party for the defendants. We've been having guilty, guilty, guilty for five years for opposing this war, and we finally got a not guilty. The people understood. This is how things change in the course of several years in the course of a growing consciousness on the part of the public which affects things that happen in a courtroom. The Selective Service System said today there have been 271 attacks on draft board offices this year. They said well, the Selective Service is under attack and we're not getting the right type of people who are going into the service, so let's go to an all volunteer army. They studied it and Nixon announced it, I think, in 1972. He saw tactically that you would do better to have a professional army that did its drafting through economic hardship, which is what we've had ever since. This is part of an ongoing series of events commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Catonsville Nine. At Andrews Air Force Base there's an Andrews Air Force Joint Forces open house. At that open house, families come and little kids are taught how to be soldiers for tomorrow, and play games with guns. There'll be a bus, take a bus to the FedExField where shuttle buses will take people to Andrews Air Force Base, where people will serve witness there. Reagan [unintelligible] from 1968, Dave. Looks like you're on the picket line. Let's close the ranks over here. The history of these actions, Catonsville and the others, is very, very important for the entire war movement today. It says something to GIs who would be violating the rules if they deserted, or they refused to serve, if they refused to go to Iraq. I think that history would give some legitimacy to young men who decide not to join the military, and give some legitimacy to people protesting, occupying buildings, occupying the offices of Senators and Congressmen; acts of civil disobedience to express opposition to the war. So if the anti-war movement didn't stop the Vietnam War, what difference did it make? Of course it contributed to the end of the war, but the main result is that it took the people's discontent and it turned it into a conscious discontent. That was something that hadn't existed before. And, it's existed ever since. It never went away. It's a testimony to the human spirit that the game is not over, that the warlords have not won, that humanity will continue to resist. We just have to decide individually which side are we on. We can't stay on the sidelines, basically. The idea of Catonsville was to say that anybody could do what we could do, what we did there. When you start to mythologize stuff, then everybody wants to come up and touch your seam and your hem of your garments, and then have a fantasy that I can't be like that. That's not what it was about. This was a call, I hate to use the term call to arms, so call to action. That's what Catonsville was meant to be. Not to have some glorification of nine people. That's a half a peace sign. Thank you for the half a peace sign. The Baltimore Four and the Catonsville Nine means something to me, simply because when I think about them, I have to say, "What am I doing now?" How, in some way or another, am I resisting? What am I doing with my life? Am I challenging the state? Am I challenging transnational corporations? Am I looking at the structural violence and structural sin that's going on in this country that's humiliating so many human beings on this planet and impoverishing so many? When young people, for instance, sometimes ask me, "How do you get started in all of this?" I say, "Well, find the nearest soup kitchen." That's the place to begin to kind of rub shoulders with some of the people whose hearts are open to the world in an immediate area. What kind of power do we each have? We're not in the ruling class, we're not in the White House, but we have power to make a moral statement, we have power to make a political statement, and we have power to use our own lives to affect change. You have to have some kind of faith that society changes every time you go out there and do that demonstration. You might not see it, but there is change. That's how things change. You'll run into someone at some point who will say, "I remember when that action happened, "when that demonstration happened. "I was only nine years old. "It convinced me to become an anti-nuke activist" or whatever. But still, we live in one of the greatest countries in the world and we still have the freedom to resist, and so we should. What the heck? If you didn't have the free- Look at those people in the Mid-East. None of them have the freedom to resist and they're doing it. Look at the faces of these young people. Look at the faces of these young people. Look us in the eye! They are not hateful. They are not hateful. Let us pray together for peace and justice. Let us pray together for peace and justice. Thank you. Thank you. Our father would counsel people who didn't live in the Mid-Atlantic that there is a mini Pentagon in your backyard. The military industrial complex is in every congressional district. Come to the Pentagon, be with us, but stay at home, too, and start a campaign there. You have to put your body on the line. It's not enough to have good ideas and sit on your couch. That doesn't actually make you either an active citizen or an engaged dissenter or even a moral person. The trick is, how do you take your morality to the streets? Opposition to aggression is far higher now than it was in the 1970s. You constantly read that there's no protest over Iraq like there is over Vietnam. That's got the story backwards. The Iraq War's the first war in Western history that I can think of where there was massive protest before it was officially launched. We kill and be killed, and then we have to come to the table and settle it. Why not come to the table first? Why not use diplomacy instead of the military? Think of the resources that are wasted while schools and other social agencies are pleading for funds. It's insane, it's insane. The people who carry this kind of thing on are a danger to themselves and others, and that's the definition of insanity. We put people in institutions for that. There's not such thing as a just war. War corrupts everybody who engages in it. You start out as the good guys, they are the bad guys, soon you are the bad guys also. Everybody becomes bad in war.
