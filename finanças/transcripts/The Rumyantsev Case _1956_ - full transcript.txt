(When it`s foggy, and when rivers overflow... by night and by day...) (we drive our cars.) (We are long-distance truck drivers.) (We work on way, and our life goes on wheels as well.) (All this started also on the road.) (It was still spring.) (Now, there is going to be a turn...) (...and everything will happen.) So, what? I`m sorry for stopping you. I didn`t know there was so many of you. What, your engine has overheated? We`ll take you in tow. That`s ok. I`ll manage to reach the place. I`m just going to Popovka. The inner tube has burst. Common, get in. Get in, I say, that`s where we`re going. Thank you very much. How much would it cost? Twenty five. How much? I`ll pay, if the inspector finds out. BYPASS Sidorov Al... Hush! Sidorov Alfred wants to get off, comrade driver. He`s welcome, but why do you have to shout? Just push and the car goes? No, it doesn`t. That`s a clutch pedal, is it clear? And this one? This one, that one, there`s a lot of stuff here. You should ask your father. I`ve got no father. Who has you got then? Polina Sergevna, aunt Vera, aunt Dusya... Aunt Dusia, I`ll go in here, may I? Of course, darling! Be careful, children. Does it happen that children get adopted? It happens. Tanka now has got a mother. She came to us to choose a daughter, well, she did find. It happens. And are children glad if they find...er...parents? Of course! Is it so bad in orphanage? No, it`s good. Why, then? Well, one ought to have father and mother, he does. Maybe, he ought to, but you can`t help it if there are no. I`m from a children`s home too. And sometimes I also feel... That`s allright, you`re gonna find your parents. No` I`m not... Why? That`s because I`m ginger! They don`t even look at me when they come to find a child. Who said you that? Who, who... like you don`t know. May I honk? Popovka - 1 km. Well, take care, my friend. Take care! What is your surname? Evdokimov. What are you talking about? It`s me - Evdokimov. No, I am Evdokimov Alexander. Aunt Dusia! Isn`t it true that I`m Evdokimov Alexander? It is, darling, it is, you`re Evdokimov Alexander. Sashka! We`re on place. Wake her up. That`s Popovka, she goes to. Go, command there to get off faster, we`re going back. Where are we going? Looks like we`re going back. Yes, why? Stop the car, I must go to Popovka! And we do not stop there. Stop the car, or I`ll jump off! Hero. Where would you go by your broken junker? Where-where, to Popovka. Nothing seems to be funny in that. Do you treat all the girls-strangers like that? No. Not all of them... The peaked cap... I`ve had the peaked cap here... Guys, the ca... Let me go in. Where? To her, to the injured. You`ve already been told, no way. Please, that`s not too much to ask. I... How could you possibly help her? Well, I don`t know, maybe I could run for something, donate blood... No. Doctor, doctor... let me, permit me... Let me visit the injured. Are you her husband? Are you a husband? No, I`m not. Brother? No. Who are you then? Just an acquaintance. A friend... Her surname, adress? I don`t know her surname. And I didn`t ask her adress. A little quieter, you there! Ehehe, she could have lived a long. So, your acquaintance`s surname is Naumenko. Klavdiya Naumenko, Lenin street, 18. How do you know that? How, how? She`s just said it herself, my friend. Herself? Herself. Anna Ivanovna, give this youth ammonium chloride. What?! Now, please. Town sales outlet First and foremost, the present for your spouse. What`s that? Curtain lace for four windows. Thank you. What, everyone goes here to play dominoes? You have guessed right. These sounds mean "friends go here". You can make your "connection" here. By the way, you`re not acquainted, comrade Zaprudny, works for supplies. Nice to meet you. Zaprudnov. And this is comrade Korolkov, worker in transport. Who are we without transport? Zero! Be brief, when do I get... this... The very time you send a car, you get the advance payment. I`ll pass it to a driver. Only that the driver must be above suspicion. The golden soviet person, as it`s said. Have you got one? You need one, we get one. The waybill for twenty nine pieces, please write in false hand. Sorry, I`ll go the other street. So...we`ll go that way. Have this driver, in this... Popovka, taken any alcoholic drinks? No. No? Why are you so sure about it? Because I`ve been sleeping. You`ve been asleep but you allege to be sure. That`s a shame, madam... Naumenko. Don`t you teach me what is a shame, and what`s not. I know for sure, that he didn`t leave the car. You know that, though you`ve been sleeping? I slept on his shoulder, he couldn`t make a move. I`m surprised by the modern youth. Without knowing a man, she puts her head on his shoulder. On whose, of some driver, a bandit on wheels. Who has crippled, destroyed her, maybe for a whole life. Aunt, don`t you dare to talk like that. And you do not dare to think like that about him. He`s the best. You can write that in your report. He`s the best... don`t you dare to think... These are not the words for a report. But I`m not going to say any other. That`s right, Klavdyinka, misfortune can happen to anybody. Look, what a bouquets he brings her every morning! And he`s a worker, not some kind of an artist... or a beer trader. No hints, please. As I work for a state salary too. So, he`s the best, best among the others. If only my Jenka would talk like that about me. I`d die happy. The only thing I hear is - you`re the worst. Aunt Pasha, give me my flowers. These are the flowers for the injured one, indeed. To make her speak for him in the court. Jermilov, be understanding, my lunch break is about to end. Listen, don`t you have a heart? They`ll find it out after the dissection. And what about your soul? No soul at all! If the hospital janitor gets a soul what will you do out of the hospital with all your bouquets and salted cucumbers? Comrade Jermilov, would you be so kind to... Listen, you`ve been told in russian language, only after four o`clock! Sorry... What a people! Well, I`ll go then... Wait! I`ve already told you, she`s got her auntie there. Well, maybe I`m an unclie? Unclie? The whole hospital knows you. Unclie! You`re not going to let me in, don`t you? No! Allright then, so long. Mishka, Mishka, honk! Honk, I say! Common, give it, give it here. Hey, hey, take the salad! Who`s honked? Here`s he, aunt, meet him. Leave, or you get wet. Are you coming tommorow? Hello! Hello! Here are cigaretts for you. The last one, your husband`s told. She promised to give up here. Let him give up first! So... half a kilo of Lubitelskaya sausage, for whom? Me, me, I love it! She`s already fine, the temperature is normal. Soon she`ll be discharged from the hospital. Thanks. So, that`s how it started. The thing, people write poems about and even sing songs. The thing, I used to laugh at before. Could I even think that the disaster was about to happen. Have you got it? I`m feed up with your accident. I don`t sleep at night. It will cost the government a pretty penny. Here, look throug the documents. What could I do? Allright, allright... To late to talk about that. You should compensate for such things with labour. It`s the custom, of course. I do not refuse to work, just tell me, where to drive. Really? For two weeks. Route to Ural. And why... For how long? Yes, yes, for two! Why? Don`t feel like? No, no, why... Dead broke, aren`t you, Sashok? That`s fine... That`s allright. I know everything! Korolkov`s also been young, he understands people. I`ve set you up here, almost across the street, on Primorskaya. Got it? Yeah. Deliver there roofing felt, on the way back... drop in at Laima. Take there 29 pieces of cargo, and deliver them right to the textile depot. Yes, there the supplies agent will wait for you. Manage to do this before Saturday, Sunday is yours then, clear? Thank you! Yes, and if you exceed the quots, we`ll write off your sins! And Korolkov is going to celebrate your wedding! Oh, you! So, all the best. No,no,no, bad sing, we`ll quarell. Sashka, how`re you doing? That`s all, I m starting on! You owe me! Thought, he`d send me somewhere far away, but no. Just to Primorskaya, then to pick up the cargo at Laima and back. That means, it`s all good? Yeah! Roads are good, you`ll finish soon. How`s Klavka? Tommorow`s been discharged, someone`s got to pick her up. We`ll do it, Pashka`ll help! Sasha, sasha, should I drive Klava at yours? Why, at mine? No-no, my room is just empty, I`ve just... Oh, no, that`s better be done right away. Of course! Do you have your money on a savings bank book? Money is right here, but... Give it here, come on! Give it here! Stop fooling around, hey! Listen, what are you going to buy? Exactly what is needed. Etageres... wineglasses... Hey, just think of it, I`m married, Sashka is going to, Pash, it`s your turn now! It`s time, my friend, it is time! I`ve got some difficulties at this front. Which difficulties? That`s if I like someone, she doesn`t like me at all. Three thousand two hundred! Why have you scattered the machine parts? Helo, comrade Korolkov! I`ll become a family man anyway. I`ll give birth to a child myself. A boy... I`ll train him in a driver, he`ll drive a truck. The atomic one! The flowers... These are for the girl in hospital. For she`d speak out for me in court. Oh, right. Stop trying to fool everyboby! He prepares for a wedding. I`ll be back on saturday afternoon. Do not be offended, that the letter is short: time presses. Yours... What, the letter is perfumed? It smells like petrol... Hey, who took my turnscrew, ı five? I find him, I`ll turn off his head! Wait with your turnscrew. Sasha Rumyantzev gets married. Oh, does he? We`ve got to furnish a flat on his arrival. Oh, to make this... what birds sit on? On eggs... Forget you your eggs...wait... Bough? You`re a bough! Something round... A nest! Nestie... Ok, buddies, we`ve got to furnish his his flat, while he`s in a trip. Whitewash, paper, buy some furniture... Furniture, paper, and what`s about money? I`ve already taken the money. First, give me back my turnscrew, whoever you are! Give me the money. Nine hundred. Thousand! That`s just what I`ve said, thousand! A bough... what an odd fellows you are! Hey, driver! How many pieces? Twenty nine. Yes. Sign here, please. Oh, the waybill, please. The cargo leave to an agent. He`ll wait for you near the textil depot. Yes, master!

You`ll find it out Here`s the wages information. About two and a half thousand on the average. Here`s...the dwelling space. The room is proper good, you`ve seen that. It`s all true, comrade Evdokimov. But you are often out of the town. Yes-s... I have neghbours, very nice people, I`ve already negotiated it with them. I`m sorry, but the neighbours...

Well... follow me. Sasha! I don`t want, I don`t want, I`ll stay with you! Sasha! Sashenka... why are you... The`ve come to visit you, and you... No one would take me anyway. Why? Every time you call me and they do not look at me! So what? So what, so what, I won`t be found anyway! Let`s go, let`s go. You`re my beauty, let`s go! Well, hi! Here, meet the aunt. You see... there`s such a thing... it`s, buddy, so, that... It occures that we are relatives. Brothers. Are we? Well, yes. You and me and me and you... I, buddy, want to ask you... to do me a favour. You know... to move to live with me... with us. In point of finances, and where to live... Please... here we are! Take your clothes off. Your peg is here. That one is too high for you. And this is now your personal property. My property? Yes! Hang your coat there, and the scurf too. And which peg is the aunt`s? But my peg is not here, Sasha. Aren`t you my brother`s wife? Oh, no, not at all, my dear. Hurray, that means no girls in the room! This is mine... Wow... You`ve figured it out and made everything the best for him. Do you like it? And whose personal property is that? This is... our personal property. Mine and yours? Yes, ours. Half-and-half. May I touch it? Of course, you may seat here if you want, please. Full speed ahead! Long live, Chapaev, hurray! TEXTILE DEPOT Vomichev will sign. Hey! Has you delivered my cargo? Comrade, hello, open the gates! Which gates are you talking about? Our storehouses are beyond the bridge, fellow! Come on, come on, fellow, faster. Or they`ll close the doors. What`s wrong? Woo it is. Machinery... Well, fix it quickly, come on. Quickly, yes, we`re about to stick around here till the morning. Till the morning? Oh, no, friend, storehouses wouldn`t wait. Looks like we should call our cars and transship the cargo. We`ll phone for a service truck from the garage. Tell me the number. Krasnoarmeyskaya, 21115. 21115, 21115, 2... Lost something? Who, me? Got fifteen copecks for a telephone? Wait... Hey, Mishka, stop! Are you from the garage? Have you got a phone call? From who? Take a quick ride back, I need some help here. I`m in trouble, both tyres have blown. I`m going to Nonka. Mishka, friend, please, help me out of trouble! I`ve got no time at all. Help-help... Nonka`s waiting for me! If I`m late, she kills me, you know her temper. Yes, but... Sashka, do not be offended. Oh, go, you... There`s an assistant there! What an oddity. I was so worried about the pie. Diligence is the mother of success. Let me bite! Wait! One, two, three, four... For luck! For luck... my aunt will eat me alife. You`re not scared of her anymore, you`re getting married. You move from her and... good luck, then! Now, I`d go for a ride on his car... He`s got a truck for fifteen tones With double-absorbancy, with horsepower 110. He can take our whole school for a ride. Why`ve you only bought sweet wine? Why? Well, he is a... He is what? He`s a driver, right? And all drivers drink. Vodka, right? And Sasha will not drink. Do you know what`s the punishment for that? Punkture in a licence. It`s a prick. Yes, and right up to some real problems. Like he needs that. Well, beetroot salad, herring, soft caviar... This board`s costing the whole scolarship. Klava, how much has remained from the money? I`ve also bought these sandals, he said they`d fit my feet! That`s how it`s going to be now: he said, he said... Oh, girls, five more minutes and I`ll starve to death. Oh, right... we`re gonna need a clean towel! He`ll need to wash after the trip. You don`t know what these trips are. Try sitting four days behind the steering wheel. You know what... I think love from the first sight really happens. Just one glance... and that`s all. Klava, wait! We`ve got to start the meeting march first. That`s a neighbour. She gave my lamp back. Give me the consignment note. Where`s the service truck... Don`t worry, it`s all right, I`ve reached them on the phone Not here, like you`re signing for the first time. It didn`t even cross my mind, that it was all suspicious. I was detained and conveyd to the Criminal Investigation Department. I didn`t go there, didn`t come myself, I was conveyed. Now I`m going to prove that I`m not guilty of anything. He can not mistake my wirds, this captain. What`s this? Sit! You can see yourself, that it`s a waybill. This waybill is a fake. Did you manage to fake it yourself, or someone helped you? Who? Are we going to keep silent? You`re silent, I am silent, just like that. Once here was another guy... he was also a driver, by the way, he kept silent for a while but eventually started talking. I`ve got nothing else to tell you. And what`s in this packet? Unwrap it. Sit! Well? The documents. How do you know that these are the documents? That guy in Laima told me... that one... with moustache. With moustache. No surname? You`ve thought up one good excuse. Who`s passed the cargo - no idea. Who`s picked the cargo - no idea. Listen, Ryumantzev, do you think I`m a fool? These are relly beautiful documents. That`s the price for delivering stolen cargo? You make a lot of money... This packet is for Korolkov. Oh, so this is not your money and you don`t know anything about it? You don`t know abot the money, about the forwader, about the taker and even what was the cargo? Pianos, carpets, galoshes... youre a driver, you must have probed it! Are you going to play the fool or tell the truth, Ryumantzev? But... comrade captain, what can I say? I`m not your comrade! Look for comrades elsewhere! For you I am sir captain, clear? Yes? Yes. Hush! I don`t want your pies, your sandals, your love from the first sight. You don`t love anybody, good for you! Wow. What, he didn`t come? Of course, I was quite sure about it. He`s got a whole sea of fishes like you. Like he does need you. How can you say that, aunt? What if something happend to him? Such men do not burn in fire and do not sink in water. And you buy caviar for him. Waste your money on him. Why`s she always nagging at you? Come to our dormitory. Stasya, let`s go! Let`s go! He doesn`t need you! He does not! No, he does. You do not understand anything, aunt. He can`t live without me, and you say, he doesn`t need me. And I can not live without him either. So... what do you have to tell me? Nothing. Well... that`s how I write it here. Stand up! Sit. Have a sit, captain. How long have you worked as a driver? For five years, sir colonel. Have you ever been prosecuted? No. Why so experienced then? Sir colonel... Because I`ve got a lot of comrades elsewhere. Do you have relatives? No. My father was also a driver. He died at the front in 1944. The photo`s been mande in 1941st, all the four friends are here. You`ve been such an eagle. And Sashka looks like his father. Nooo, Sasha has his nose looking more like... bubble. And uncle Vasya, uncle Vasyua hasn`t changed a bit. Where I put it? Right here! Right under the lamp, for the newlyweds had their first course and second course better illuminated! Toshka, bring it here! All the furniture is new. It is. Oh, I`m so glad for Sasha. Indeed! This is THE wood, nutwood! Why nutwood, this is birch! Oak! You`re an oak! Up she goes! How does she look like? Is she plumpy, dark haired? No... she`s...pointed nose. I wouldn`t say she`s that imposing, but... all right. It`s more about taste. She is the one he injured in the accident! Step away from the car! Oh, I`m going to... Well, that`s all. Let`s write the note and - mount! Here! Write! So... The whole our driving team is writing you. And he`s still there in some rut waiting for a service truck! He must have a lot of caress there! Writ! As we all in our garage treat you as our son, we ask you... To give us a grandson... With a very good showing! He`s got all the conditions for that! Where are you going? I`ve got to deliver something else. Hey, give us a change! The change, yes, the change! Only 30 rubles with small change have left. He.. and 30 rubles? I`ve got everything in perfect order, my friend Oh, well done! And it is good for a newlyweds` table! Stop listening. There are thousands of cars in the town! It`s easy to go mad. Hey. What are you looking at? Why are you looking here? It is not for you! Don`t you dare, Klavdiya! She`s just crazy. We shouldn`t let her be alone. Here`s a question for you, mister Korolkov. For you! I`m ready. Have you ordered the driver Rumyantzev to deliver from Laima 29 pieces of cargo? If I had, it would have been farmalized in itinerary blank! A there it is said clear - Primorsky route. That means 200 rolls of roofing paper... Rolls, you say... Yes, roofing paper, of course, in rolls. What Laima? How could you forget? You told me yourself not to go back empty! And the waybill... And I did give you this waybill myself? No. You shamless man! Quiet, quiet! Stop staring! Decided to deliver unlicensed cargo and got into trouble! Our Department sees everything, you can`t hide from them! Mister Korolkov. we don`t need your reasoning. Why? Let him speak. Yes, please. What I was talking about, sir colonel, is that some people tried to proclaim him a hero. He, they say, almost killed himself but safed a person. And Korolkov himself has been driving for 25 years! I know drivers inside out! I`ve assumed right there, that Rumyuantzev`s been a bit drunk! Well, had one hundred and fifty of beer before the trip. The girl...all the things... and crushed the car. You won`t get out of this, mister Rumyantzev! You`re responsible for the team`s trust. And for your father - the hero, who sacrificed his life... Sit, Rumyantzev! Quiet! Quiet! Give me your pass! That`s the youth we`ve brought up. We gave up our lives and they... That`s all, mister Korolkov. Is it true? Rumyantzev! It is. All like he said. Why are you asking me? The money is mine, I`ve written the waybill, and the cargo, and the girl, come on, put me into prison! ...as an unmasked plunderer of the Soviet property... must be fired after the 14th. Oh... it`s just... Sashka Rumyantzev - a plunderer? Wht do they know about him? What, what, went on a strike, boys? Oh... the order. Well, some of you should read it carefully. Those who speak the loudest. Do you understand, what you have wtitten? Not only do we understand, we`re going to have a meeting. There we`ll find out where such plunderers of soviet property come from. And who these self-seekers support. Yes, like that. Yees. Yees. Gives us a scare. I think, we`d better go to the police. Go... why? I think our Department can sort it out without our help. Department... I`ve been myself Department in the 1918th. I`ve made some mistakes. Let`s go to the police. Damn it! What? Where are you going? I get motor oil today. Almost forgot! Motor oil, you say... I see. Go, get your oil. Listen, Rumyamtzev, I`ve got one more question for you. Do you remember the appearance of this supplying agent? No... Maybe not appearance, any habits, anything special about his behaviour? No. It seemed, like he`d lost something. A thing or a document. Lost... a thing? Sometimes a thing becomes a document. I wanted to tell you... Yes? When I was loafing... I mean waiting with the cargo, one man saw me. A driver from our garage, Snegirev Mishka, he can confirm! Snegirev? Do you know his adress? We`ll call him. You know what, Rumyantzev, This man... Does he look like your agent? No. Wait, wait, look carefully. Yeah... I say and then you...him... He may be an honest man. We... him... We, Rumyantzev do not hold honest men in these folders. Rumyantzev, didn`t he do like that with his lip? He`s just a person, like everybody. May I take another look? Look, look. Carefully. Looks like... Him! Yes. Yes, comrade colonel, here! They`re here... yes. Stop smoking. In black and white, comrade captaine, he had an order to go to Laima, that`s true! And why Korolkov denies that? I shall assume... He`s a crook, this Korolkov! A big crook! Who`s a crook? We have one. Korolkov, the chief. Crook he is! Have a sit. Keep withing the limits, comrades. I am withing the limits, comrade captain. Or I would use another language. Drivers` language. Why are you looking at me like that, comrade captain? We know you. You all cover each other up. And you wouldn`t write what we tell you. And uncle Jasha is a kommunist since the 1918th. And Levihov reached Berlin! So I`m a driver now, that`s not bad. I just didn`t manage to become... this... We`re sincere people, do you understand it? And I ask you to respect our testimony. Or... I`ll go right to the Prosecutor-General, he`ll recieve me, listen to me and make some conclusions. Who, Klavdiya? Yes, she`s at home. Come in here. May I? I`m with brother. Come in, please. Hello. Hello. A pea jacket occured to be necessary for him. See, now you`re hot. You must be waiting for Sasha. You never know... he could stick somewhere on the road. It can be something with the engine, it happens. Me myself once fell over the ditch, downhill. I had to have two dentures made! Here, two of them, see? Made of stainless steel! All right, all right. And another accident. The car screwd, turned... ... the driver died. But Sashka`s alife. Not even hurt. Are you talking about a man, who got into prison? Do not interfere! Go, buddy, look out of the window, how`s our motorcycle doing. He`s in prison, Klavdiya. He`s charged with a criminal act. I`ve always told you it would end up like this! What could you know, when he`s an honest man. What exactly? And I thought... let`s go, brother! Wait, Pasha, I`m going with you! What... Klavdiya... Where are you going? I leave you, aunt. Like that, forever. Listen, Korolkov... haven`t I left at yours an awl? What the hell do I need it for? I could just keep on driving... but no! I don`t care if everything goes to ruin! True to cause, true to cause... Why do you care at all? For the ninth time you`re here, but I do not care... Have you seen that? Quiet. We`d better drown him... this driver. Finish him, forever. Do you understand me? How... finish? Why? We`ll write him a letter. It`s a very old and good trick. Like it`s from his accomplices. Like he`s not the only one and there`s a band. And they`ll put him back inside. Is your son at home? Vovka! Vovka, are you here? Come here, your daddy is calling for you... What, dad? Come here. Say hello. Hello. Doyaa... wanna go to the cinema? Wann-na some ice-cream? I want to go to sleep. G-good for you. Good for you. Have a sit. Write. Again a waybill? A fool. A letter... write. Write: "My friend, Sashka" Write, write. "All you troubles will be over, like smoke comes off the white apples". Go away. Have you seen that? Go on. "Five thousand, your share, dogs must have taken away." Good boy, good boy. "As you get the term, we`ll put it secretly to you in the pri... prison". "You`ll live a good life"" "Do not be disappointed". That`s all. "Disappointed" needs double-p? Disappointed...? Double, double! Of course, double! What do they teach you in school? Hands up, Shmiglo! My God, Sergry Ivanovich, never thought, I`d see you alive and kicking. Please, please... Just think, we`ve met again. You must be very glad. Have a sit. Thank you. Wow, what a nice thing. Tulle... Cheap... and my wife`s been standing for four days in a line, wanted to get some for our son`s windows` curtain... she didn`t manage. Realy? What a shame... Well, Shmiglo, or Zaprudny, or Pribitkov, or Dalsky... Dalsky... or now it`s Popov... Are you all right? Why? You used to be quite a good swindler, didn`t you? What happened? Are you exhausted? Or it`s just the age? Yes, we`ve known each other for a long time. We`re quite familiar to each other. So should we waste our time? Do you smoke? I do. And I`ve quitted, can you imagine that? Troubles with heart. And altogethter... I remember... a cigar, Gavana, the seashore... Yes... I caught you there, in Odessa. The year 1924... Yes, I remember, I was sitting at Fanconis`, with a cup of cofee. Turkish...and suddenly, "A magic moment I remember..." you come in. So young, so attractive. And there goes your traditional "hands-up". And then, the last word of the accused... Ladies were crying, I was talking about the music. Stop it. Yes I remember. I remember how you feigned madness. And no so bad. Yes, I confused those psychiatrists. That`s who I was... experts came to see me, you were the only one not to believe. Sergey Ivanovich, you`re clever person. Yes, that`s how it goes, Shmiglo. It`s hard to hide an awl in a sack. What? That`s a russian proverb - you can`t hide an awl in a sack. An awl, you know, to prick different things, so, that awl is very difficult to hide in a sack. So, shall we have a talk? Sorry, but I know another proverb. A thief isn`t a thief until caught in the act. Sergey Ivanovich, you know my strategy. I never admit my guilt. Never! And, as I see, you`ve got no evidence. Listen, Shmiglo, you`re very expirienced, but still a very nervous man. And also absent-minded, after all your failures. Like that. Well, I have to start the search. How do you know him? Oh, I see, you`re the one, who crashed in the car. He used to ask me all the time: "Aunt Tanya, aunt Tanya, is she going to live?" I also work in medicine. I`m a janitor in a clinic. I`ve searched through the whole town but didn`t find him. Oh, no! The do not pass the parcel. Cigarettes must have got wet. He smokes Belomor, doesn`t he? Don`t be sad, dear. Here`s his room, come in! He`ll be back. He`s an honest man, I know for sure. And you wait, live here as his wife. Look, the room was prepared for you. Change your shoes. Here`re his home shoes. Why did they do this to him, aunt Tania? He`s young... passionate... simple... got ensnared by people. And please put the chair at it`s place, Sergey Ivanovich. Like that. No evidence. Maybe you`ve really become an honest man, Shmiglo? Believe me, Sergey Ivanovich! I can`t belive you, Shmiglo, I` d like to, but I can`t. Well... Sit! This is where one very important thing, that you thought, you`d lost, could fall. What the hell, maybe it`s hanging there right now, behind the lining. All right, it`s over. There`s... ... an awl, comrade colonel. But take into account the frank confession! Honest! You didn`t find it, I`ve shown you where`s the awl myself, myself! With this awl I`ve.. Write, write the testimony! I`ve made the punctures. The cargo is... I`ll show you where. Who else worked with you? Korolkov. Who else? Do not torment yourself, Shmiglo. One more... named Prus. Sergey Ivanovich, have you taken out the awl? There was no awl. How... what do you mean... I`ve said that it could be there under the lining. You`ve searched for it there, haven`t you? Oh, Shmiglo, Shmiglo... Quietly. Don`t joke like that, Shmiglo. It`s even funny at your age. Sergey Ivanovich, even at my age I don`t want to see the checked sky. You should have a rest, comrade colonel. It`s been a third night. That`s all right, don`t teach me. Here`s your dinner. The cafe is closed and your tea is cold. Put back the cigarettes. I didn`t take them. Give back the cigarettes, I can see them. I just don`t understand, comrade colonel, how it feels when the heart aches. Is it like a toothache? Like that. Has my wife called? Twice. Put me through to her. Anyuta, it`s me! What have I been doing? Sleeping. And now I`m having my tea. No... have you already reported to her? Not even a word! Oh, my dear Pinkerton, you`re always there. I`m coming, I`m already wearing the coat, yes, truly, I`m coming. There`s one driver waiting for you there. For a while already. The tall one? Yes. Maybe tomorrow? No tomorrow! Ask him in in a minute. What an imp. Who`s there? It`s me... don`t be scared, I`m sorry for a late visit. I want to talk to Klavdiya. Hey, lady! Open! Klavdia isn`t living here anymore, I don`t know where she`s gone. Propably to the prison, you`ve broke out of! I haven`t broke out. I need... I just want to know. I don`t know anything. And Klavdiya doesn`t want to know you either! Don`t you dare to stand there, I`ll call for police, you, criminal! A criminal... Investigation is still in progress. They let me out for a while... Your pass! Haven`t you recognised me, aunt Pasha? I don`t have to. Done so much and not ashamed to look in people`s eyes? Come on. Read the order. Who`s there? Where`s Evdokimov? I am Evdokimov. Why? Evdokimov... Hi. Hello. And where`s your... Brother? He must be here soon. I`ll wait. Here`re the teachers` references, from the school times. This is the reference from our komsomol organisation. He`s done everything with love, you see! We point that there. With love is good. Now about the work. When there`s any long, unprofitable trip he`s always the first to go. Here`s the plan, it`s about that accident... The road was wet, and here`s the cross, it`s a girl! The length of the braking distance... Listen, friend, I already know all that. But it isn`t really needed now. Why? He showed himself as a hero, Rumyantzev! This is a plus for him. How do you think? Yes, it is. You`ve adopted a boy. An orphan. This is a plus for you. How do you know that? Who would we be if, working here, we only knew the bad about people? Well, go. Your Rumyantzev must be looking for you all over the town. How... did you let him go? Can I ask you something important? Do you have a cigarette? I do! I`ll take... a couple of them, all right? Take, take! Thanks. I`m sorry. We let him go, but this is not teh end. Another one about Rumyantzev? Yes. I don`t like these visits. Why? Too much of them...defenders. In some way they are too organized. It`s true, it`s true, Samohin, organized... Right, the swindler he is a swindler, comrade colonel. How do you do that? Not so long being the investigator, but still too expirienced. You don`t know the Dzerginsky`s biography. He was merciless to too mistrustful people. And we must respect every soviet man, especially, while working here! And "the man" is a proud word. That`s right, comrade colonel! It is, not my words, Gorkiy`s. So... I`ll have to dismiss you for a while. Until you understand what is what. Go. Here... you can go for a trip. Let`s make some prevention to that one also. You can stay here at night, if you don`t have your own home. Thank you, I do have a home. Are you in trouble? Why do you think that? When my brother is in trouble he also sits silent. Why, has something happened to him? His best friend is in prison! Aunt Lyuba came and said, hoe awful it was there. I`m also in trouble... What`s wrong with you? This is about nopourout, such a inkpot, you know... I know. It doesn`t let pour, but you can shake ink out. Did you shake? I did. On yourself? No, of course, on Viktor...disaster... What`s that? It means I`ve to go to sleep. Well, all the best. We`ll fix the back part other time. When your brother comes, tell him that Sashka Rumyantzev has come. Sasha Rumyantzev, I`ll remember. Snegirev Sashka... you... Where have you come from? They let me go. They let you go? With a receipt? We`ve got to go, Michail. we`re late! Where are the tickets? Look under the tablecloth, near the TV! Mishka... You see, I`ve got the tickets to the theater... 16 rubles each. I want to ask you... They are not there, look near you! Misha, it`s serious... No, look again! Leave me alone! They`ll call for you from the Department. You tell them, that... From the Department? Him... to the Criminal Department? Why? Wait, Nona, I`ve asked them myself. Do you remember passing by on your motorcycle, near the vacant lot? He was driving for you. Intersting... when was he? It`s when I sat there with that damned cargo... I asked Michail to call for the service truck. You just confirm, Mishka, that`s all. Why.. why are you so silent? Why should he talk? He`s not that mad to butt in such things. I`m not talking to you! Thank you very much. You talk to him, you talk to me, he is still my husband and he`s not going to do that. Nonka... Some criminals around... And Michail is a social person, he`s got perfectly clear reputation... Wait a little! Listen, sasha, I did pass by, but, please, do not draw me into this. It`s not a comrade thing to do. Let`s do like this. You by yourself and I by myself. And I do not have to go for a service truck after work! I`ve done my job, I`m free, right? Can you fancy that, he draws the man into his dirty deals. Are we going? Sure, sure! Here`s hot that clean, I`d say... What a mean peopple you are... You`ll pay for these words! Sasha...Sashenka...what have you done, tell me the truth. What? The truth? Why did you come here? To say that you`re also by yourself, yes? No, Sasha! I`ve been... waiting for you. I`ve been looking for you. With a parcel. If they condemn you, I go with you! I don`t need your pity, I don`t need anything. I`ll find them myself, I`ll arest them. You`ll see, who I really am! Maybe I did wrong... Well, punish me. But here`s one letter. It came on our depot`s adress, for Rumyantzev. Of course, I opend it and delivered right to you. For only the reasons of vigilance, comrade colonel. It is good. Interesting... You see, the whole band. Do not be disappointed, they say, we`ll help you. What a people! The most interesting is the fact that the waybill, that was given to Rumyantzev, and this letter were written by the same person. By your son. Comrade colonel. He`s just like his dad. Comrade colonel... I am not your comrade. Sorry. Sir colonel. Comrade... Shmiglo`s arrested. I assume, you don`t know that. You`re exposed. Absolutely! There is a man who works in Laima, Prus. Do you know him? I do... Comrade colonel, please, if there is any way I could help the investigation... You can call him. Me? Yes. I can. Which is his number? Do not worry that much. Please, find the letter "p". "P"... let`s find "p". Put me through to Laima. You`ll set a date to him and his loaders, somewhere in Laima, today, at ten o`clock, clear? Yes. Hello, Laima, 217, yes. Speak normally, with a cheerful voice! I`ll try. Hello, it`s Korolkov... Yes, yes... where am I calling from? From my home. Yes-yes, it is all right! How do I feel? I feel well. We`ve got to meet, yes, we`ve got to, yes. Ten it is. We`ll be there. Yes, I`ve got something to talk about. Yes-yes. Here... May I? I`m here about the Rumyantzev`s case. Snegirev. Here`s the writ. Well, Snegirev, what`s the problem? It`s been the third writ, you`ve never came. I was in a trip, comrade chief. That`s not true. You didn`t leave the town. I mean, yes, no, I... Have a sit. Yes, sir. I hardly know Rumyantzev. We are more like hello-goodbye-how are you, that`s all. Now he`s exposed. He`s in pursuit of money. Well, and Korolkov, I hope, you know as a good person. Exclusively. He`s been a driver too, gained authority. Say then, have you seen Rumyatzev on the road, when he was loafing? Did he ask you to call for a service truck? Me? You, you. No... you mean, service... yes. Comrade chief, I`ve got nothing to do with this. You... Are you afraid to soil yourself? You must have a very clean reputation. I do. You can ask. Why would I? They wouldn`t tell me how you`ve sold out your comrade. And he asked to call you as a witness. And you`ve betrayed the honest guy. Give me your writ. You`re sitting on it. I`m sorry. To make everything in perfect order... Once you`ve payed 30 copecks for me in a tram. That`s right! Treated a glass of beer to me last spring. Get your 2.20. For a tram... for tickets...for... Hey, what`s wrong? Wait, Snegirev, was it you, who whitewashed Rumyantzev`s ceiling? Me, why? Was the material yours? It was. Half a hundred, including your work. That`s right, give the money. Get it! And remember after all the words of comrade Mayakosky I`d like to deafen them with tridactylous whistle, in granny and in God`s soul... ... excuse me. Quiet, guies. You, leave. Go, go. Do not hurry, Korolkov told them to be there at ten. I`ve been looking for them for a whole day in this little seaside town. Here I got this damned cargo. And only in the evening I accidently run into the familiar car. One more cognac. Please. Hey, friend, have a sit! Oh, my old friend, and where is Korolkov? Do you want... I`ve been looking for you for a whole day. You do not discuss business in here, here you only... Let`s go Takov. Well, what did you want to tell me? What happened? Speak, you bastard. Let me go! Guys, he`s a thief! Who do you think you are, to arrest me? I`m a man, and you are a thief! You won`t get away! It`s them. You are Prus. Yes. Pretend to be Estonian. You`re Tihayev`s son. No, it is a mistake, I be not... Don`t show me your accent, I know you. Quiet. Son, son, why have you... Oh, you, all by yourself, by yourself... Anywhere else... everywhere he`s the comrade. The comrade... This is the end of my story. I`ll come back from my trip, open the door... And I`ll say, hello, my wife. The End
