At the height of the Ming Dynasty... the emperor's eunuchs gained excessive power. They abused their position... and set up an East Bureau and a West Bureau. All government officials were closely spied on. East Bureau, or the East Investigation Bureau... infiltrated agents into all major government offices. Officials were investigated and arrested. Many died in the grip of East Bureau agents. West Bureau was the emperor's Secret Service. It was responsible for gathering intelligence. It cast its nets far and wide. Charges were fabricated. Victims were locked up. The name West Bureau induced fear and panic. Suspects faced immediate arrest and torture. Today, the head of East Bureau, Wan Yulou... visits the Longjiang Naval Shipyard. Instead of inspection, his ulterior motive is to arrest opponents... and to execute them on the spot. Bring the Minister of Law and the Junior War Minister. At hand. Bring the prisoners. Bring the prisoners. - Here are the prisoners. - Here are the prisoners. Kneel. Face judgement. You two tried to report that I take bribes... that I extort money from officials. But before your letter reached the emperor, I was able to intercept it. You think to challenge the East Bureau. You are like soldiers in a defeated army... fatally weakened, skulking in the shadows. But I know you are not bold enough... to report this nonsense story to the emperor. There must be someone else behind you. Minister of Five Armies, step forward. Can Qianzhi, Minister of Five Armies, reporting. You are a master of treachery. You hid your plot behind two fifth-grade officials. Behind your smooth talk, you're a plotter. Now I must undo your hard work. - Guards. - Yes, sir. Give me some wine. Time to taste some pickled body parts. Cut off his tongue, right away. Yes, sir. Restrain the prisoners. Alert. There is someone on the drum tower. Attack on the right. - The captain is taken. - Your Eminence. Don't worry. We are here to rescue you. You are wearing protective armour... with your skills and all these guards... and you are still afraid of an assassin? Tell me whose body I'm going to pickle. My name is Zhao Huai'an. But you won't need to remember it. I'll carve my name on your cursed forehead to show the world who killed you. You are working for the Civil Service Minister. He's already dead, by the way. You're just ensuring that the last of his men die too. We are surviving better than your manhood did. Hey. You've drunk so much pickled-flesh wine... that you can't even draw your sword. You really do deserve to die. Insolent. Eunuch. Your lackeys and your enemies are all watching. They will tell the world of your fate. Go to hell. What's going on? - What is that? - Report this. Hurry. Look at that. Look at it. Lock all the gates. Wait for orders. Sir. Go. Your Eminence, your family has been moved to safety. You will see them again very soon. You may sleep easy. - Thank you for saving us. - Thank you. - Thank you for saving us. - Farewell. The Imperial Court is so bad that men like us have to mete out justice. It's a pity. Without good officials, who will care for the people? In the last few months... we have decimated the eunuchs who ran the East Bureau. Now they're gone, I'm sure the good officials will soon come back. We can defeat any hurdle. But against their best guys, it won't be that easy. DAJUE TEMPLE. The front and back doors are well-guarded. Many guards are deployed to the east and west. The temple is secured both inside and out. Unauthorised persons will be killed. - You may leave. - Sir. How should we report this to the emperor? - Let's discuss this. - It needs careful consideration. Thanks to that Zhao Huai'an, we are forced to hide here. - What if we don't report? - Oh, we have to. Despite the witnesses that day, does the emperor have to be told? If anyone speaks up, I'll silence him. It's that simple. Report. Eunuch Yu of West Bureau is here with his subordinates. This is a matter for the East Bureau. Why is he here then? A single swordsman has you cowering in fear. So you're hiding here, too scared to return to the palace. Isn't it my business if they attack us too? Attack you too? They're no more than rabble. The East Bureau will deal with them. That day at the naval shipyard... Weren't you all protected? But some man named Zhao had no trouble coming in and decapitating your leader. There's nobody except a bunch of cowards here. How would you manage to deal with them? Eunuch Wan was too careless. That's all. He misread his foe. Misread? He's too weak. East Bureau's masters have been killed, one by one. Your chiefs, captains, team heads. It's your turn next. - How dare you. - Sit down. You think you'll be safe hiding here? We are imperial servants to help the emperor. I find you quite presumptuous. Who do you think you are? The West Bureau is new, and you talk to me like that? Insolent and without respect. Sir. You ask who we think we are? Then let me tell you. West Bureau exists to remedy East Bureau's failures. Listen well. There's more. I'll kill those East Bureau would not dare kill. I'll take care of what East Bureau botches. Whatever East Bureau manages, I will take over. Whatever East Bureau can't manage, I will manage. We don't need prior approval. That's who we are. Is that clear enough? Concubine Wan is summoning him again. That Johnny-come-lately treats the palace and her bed... like his home. THE CONCUBINES' QUARTERS. Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship, Eunuch Yu of West Bureau has been waiting. Send for him. Treasure of my heart. Come here. I gave you West Bureau to maintain control here. Why are you needling East Bureau? Your duty is to keep the maids out of His Majesty's bed. Why waste time on those old men of East Bureau? Wouldn't I be happier if you stayed here with me? Your Ladyship, I always take your orders seriously. If His Majesty so much as glances at another woman... she's gone by the next day. Please don't worry. Your Ladyship is the only woman allowed to get pregnant here. I have found several pregnancies among the maids. What kind of women let men take advantage? Of the four, three are said to have been with guards. To forestall any rumour involving His Majesty, I've had them executed. Four hussies, three executions. And the fourth woman? The fourth one got away. The name is Su Huirong. I've sent men to catch and kill her. It's a large troop. Who are they after? Their banners are of West Bureau. They're heading for Red Rock Gully. Let's go see what's happening. Sir, there is someone up there. - I wonder who it is. - Watch him carefully. Boatman, pull in here. - We must search the boat. - Stop rowing. Officials want to search the boat. Hey. Pull in here. - Stop rowing. - There's nothing on the boat. Don't worry. Just tell them you're a bit seasick. It'll be fine. You don't even know what we're looking for. We're not hiding anything. How many women on your boat? Tell them all to go to the bow. It was thrown from the boat. Report it. Report. Sir. This scented purse was found in the water. The handiwork looks familiar. Who allowed you to sit? Officer, don't hit her. My wife is sick. Who cares? - Have mercy. - You must follow our order. You. Stand up. Hey. Off the boat. This purse is costly. Why was it thrown away? The scent. Let's see if it lingers. You ran away from the palace? Sir, I am... I am... Come on. Speak up. What's in your belly? - Let's take a look. - Yes, sir. Restrain her. Please stop, sir. Let me go. Please don't hurt my ba... You are Su Huirong? Yes, sir. Check if he has an accomplice. Guard the criminal. Release the woman. I'll say it again. Let her go. Release. Back away. They haven't backed off. They must want me to kill you. - Back off. She'll kill me. - Tell them to jump in the water. Jump. Why are you standing there? All of you. Jump in the water. Jump. Good. I will spare your life. Go back and do one thing for me. Tell your boss my name, Zhao Huai'an. Huh? Zhao Huai'an? You are Zhao Huai'an? Climb to the top of the scaffolding now. Stay there for four hours. - Then you may go. - Yeah. Yeah. I told you to stay put. What are you looking at? Checking that I'm still here? Great knight. Great knight. Shouldn't we get away from here? I know you're skilled, but we should not stay here, right? I'm waiting for someone. Waiting? Who are you waiting for? So beautiful here. Let's drink. Brother Zhao. He's having a drink, like last time. - Then we'll drink too. - Thanks. He is impersonating you. Does he want to lure you? Let him be. He rescues people. The more Zhao Huai'ans, the better for the world. For you. Brother Zhao, I think you know each other. Why don't you greet him? We're both loners. Old jianghu friends. No need for us to meet. A carrier pigeon. Did the West Bureau people release it? It's flying west. Then their boss has left the capital. It's weird. Did West Bureau send a force like that just to chase a pregnant woman? They will send more troops. Let's see if we can help. Inform His Highness. All is in order. Yes. A carrier pigeon has arrived. News from Red Rock Gully? Your Highness, Su Huirong was rescued by a man. He said he's Zhao Huai'an. Jinliang, do you have any idea which way the fugitives might go? If they go east, they'll go back to the capital. North would take them to the border. - So they will go north? - In two days, they'll cross it. Can a pregnant woman handle riding a horse that far? The water passage takes longer, but they could cut through Chiayu Pass. To Dragon Gate through Luo River. Let's wait at Dragon Gate. Set the mainsail. Sail Northwest at full speed. Set the mainsail. There are two men at the bow. Protect His Highness. So these are West Bureau men? Let's see if they are as good as people say. Move. Who are you? I'm Chief of West Bureau, Ma Jinliang. The sail is collapsing. Protect His Highness. Look out. Look out. And your name is? Yu Huatian. And you are? Zhao Huai'an. Ling Guozhou, this way. - Archers, get to the bow. - Sir. Load your arrows. Take Chongzheng. Ling Guozhou. Go. Your Highness, the so-called Zhao Huai'an was not so hard for you to deal with. But Zhao is with Su Huirong. So what's he doing here? Was that an impostor? No. He took on the East Bureau in the same way. He's not an impostor. If he's the real Zhao, who's the one with Su in Red Rock Gully? No matter how many Zhao Huai'ans there are... I will hang their severed heads outside West Bureau. He won't elude me. Keep on following Su Huirong. We'll show East Bureau how to deal with such foes. Yes, Your Highness. Great knight? What are the words carved on these two steles? They're in Xixia script, more than 400 years old. Thanks to erosion by the wind and sand... only the characters Dragon and Gate are legible. That's why this place is called Dragon Gate. Yumen Pass is nearby, to the west. That's your escape route. They won't dare follow you there. I should go alone? You'll stop protecting me? I told you at the start I'd bring you to safety. Now you go alone. Go. Great knight. You keep playing the flute. My guess is that it's a love token. Am I right? Pretty good guess. It is a love token, but it's not for me. It's for someone else. Then who? Why should you care about that? Anyway, I must give this flute to someone on behalf of its owner. If you mention the flute again, I will stop talking to you. - Understand? - Yes. - Any resemblance? - To who? The one you are seeking. Listen. If you ask any more questions about me, I'll abandon you. You'll never see me again. Jump. I'll catch you. I can't. I'm pregnant. I can't jump. Great knight. - Our goods packed already? - Yes. Check the other side, if it's tied properly. Take more water. We'll leave soon. DRAGON GATE INN I just arrived, and you're telling me to leave? What kind of inn is this? I'm so sorry. Tomorrow or the day after, the black sandstorm will arrive. That flock of birds was a sign. It will be a huge sandstorm. It will bury the inn. No water and no food. Even our staff will shelter in the courier station. Oh, gentlemen. I'm so sorry. Because of the weather, our inn is... Say no more. We're passing through. We'll leave after eating. I'm so sorry. How far is the courier station? The courier station is 125 miles from here. The mountains there could block the wind. They have food and water there. It will take half a day by camel. Take plenty of water. Water is a necessity in a desert. I forgot the dried food. I'm so sorry. Travel safely. Saddle up. Load the cargo. I told you to let no one in. So who are they? They ignored me. I couldn't stop them. I know. We'll leave after our meal. Welcome to the inn. Here. Peanuts and dried fruits. What would you like to order? Can you make mutton soup with noodle? Mutton soup with noodle, yes. We'll have two bowls of plain noodles. Nothing else. All right. Plain noodles coming right up. Two plain noodles. Ah. Two bowls of Nun noodles. - Excuse me. - Vegi may not be vegi. The house rule is that returning customers use their own chopsticks. New customers use the inn's chopsticks. It's the rule at a black inn. What's a black inn? See? There have been many fights here. They can't wash out all the bloodstains. Innkeeper. Come over here. - Oh, no. Please stop. - Damn you. Sir, what's wrong? Who do you think we are? You give us white meat? White meat? You know the rules. You think we're new here. Oh, a big mistake. - Dong, change the meat. - Yes. What's with white meat? Why are they so angry? New customers get white meat. - What kind? - Human flesh. It's from people who used the inn's chopsticks. Here it is. Coming through. Two bowls of Nun noodle... Sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Get back to the kitchen, you clumsy oaf. Master Lu Bu. Please wash your hands, refresh yourself. Have you seen an unfamiliar woman in the past 10 days? Unfamiliar? Can't say I have. The fact is a brother of mine bought a woman in the capital. He was about to marry her when she ran off. My buddies here... I shouldn't say buddies. My brothers here... they're helping me to track down the bitch. So if you've seen her recently... What she says is you bastards are engaged in forcing women to be whores. You exploit women and you call them bitches. That's ludicrous. Please, my friends, guests, denizens of jianghu... you come here very often. So does Master Lu Bu. So do his friends here. Can't we all get along? You're not from the capital. You shouldn't hold any grudges against each other. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'm a poor host. - Have some wine on the house. - Damn you. - I meant no disrespect. - Damn you. She did that to test my skill. Next time, I won't let her off so lightly. Listen. Don't take in guests for the next two weeks. - We will rent the whole inn. - That's impossible, sir. There's a huge sandstorm on the way. We have to shelter ourselves at the courier station. It's too dangerous to stay here. - You won't survive. - A huge sandstorm? Yes. The Dragon Gate black sandstorm is terrifying. It will bury a large area in sand. It might even blow the inn away. Who knows? Take the money. Either we stay or not. I can't take it. Also, I don't dare offend our other party of guests. So you dare offend us? Nonsense. Sir, we really can't accept this money. You can't take the whole inn if they don't leave. I really don't know how to turn them out. Don't worry, innkeeper. If the sandstorm doesn't scare them, their lives are cheap. I'll send them to hell early. Again? Bastard, you're that hungry? Oh, no. I'm not hungry. Of course you aren't... not after helping yourself to a whole leg of lamb. It's safe to eat. They wouldn't argue if it was human flesh. What is it? We don't know anything, sir. - We just work here, sir. - We can't decide anything. The innkeeper holds all the money. Please, spare us. - You have to talk to... - Spare us, please. What is it? What will it do in the wine? Dragon Gate Inn turned black three years ago. The woman owner ran away to escape arrest. Do you also oppose the Imperial Court? That had nothing to do with us. We'd never dare oppose the Imperial Court. Then do what I tell you. I will. I will. Now put this in the wine and serve it to the Tartars. It will kill them. I dare not do that, sir. Great knight, may I ask you something? It depends what it is. How do you know this place so well? Have you been here many times? Are you... Watch what you say. What do you want to ask? Are you the woman who left three years ago? If I were that woman owner, the staff would have recognised me. Isn't that so? Yes. Got it. They're here. I found this outside. Deputy Chief, the sky looks strange. I think a black sandstorm is really coming. We should have a contingency plan. His Highness may be at the station. Tell Lidong to guard the stables. Keep our horses and set the others free. Yes, sir. Jinliang, this place is named Dragon Gate... after the inscription on two steles. Yes, Your Highness. That's a local legend. Follow each other closely. The caravan ahead... Did anybody go astray? Open up the barracks. Give them shelter. Yes, sir. Riders on the east, this way. Your Highness, everyone is coming here, seeking shelter. This place will soon be full. Please order them to stop letting any more people in here. Let them in. Yes, sir. We must hurry. I wonder if Zhao Huai'an will show up. He's a foolhardy man. I can anticipate his every move. Don't make it hard for him to enter. Since I'm here, I'm sure he will come. Hold up there. There's another one. Oh. Sir. Sir. Deputy Chief, we have searched everywhere. No trace of them. I have men still searching. What is it? What's happened? He's poisoned. How come he's poisoned? - What did you say? - My boss says... Ask your mother how to poison. You can't fool us with these little tricks. You poisoned yourself. Draw your swords. Innkeeper. We're too late to cross the border. We need shelter. Your flag's still flying. - Why is the door closed? - We're full. - Nonsense. - Go away. There's a sandstorm out here. We can sit on the ceiling even if you're full. - Open the door. - Gang Zi, you go. Oh, yes. Right away. I don't want to yell from the outside. The wind is getting stronger. - I'll tell him to leave. - Anyone alive inside? Sir, it's a blessing in disguise. You're lucky that we're full. Lucky, huh? You buffoon. You are asking for trouble. You've drawn swords, but pretend to be peaceful? Where are you from? We're here already. Would anybody speak to us? Why would His Highness... Maybe he's a look-alike. He might not be His Highness. Let's find out. My great knights. You can see that we're completely full up. We really have no room for you. For shelter from the sandstorm... the best thing would be to go to the courier station. It's much safer, a solid building, and it has plenty of space. No need to go. Our boss will let the gentleman have her room. One room? That's ridiculous. Matter of fact, if you don't mind, you can have two fine rooms. May I invite the gentleman to a drink? A flash of sword, a taste of wine. We have vintage amber wine here. A wine for real connoisseurs. Please honour me by accepting. Fine. We accept. See if His Highness is at the station. Do you pass this way very often? To make inquiries, if it's a rule of jianghu... you should tell me why you drew swords. I am talking to this gentleman. It's none of your business. But I am also talking to you now. Why isn't it my business? Oh, I see. What you really want is to know why I'm here. Right? No need to answer now. On your way here, was this lady knight your only companion? Are you bandits? Are you assessing us before robbing? How rude. Who do you think you are to talk like that? Who do you think you are to talk to me like that? Jianzong. Well, I'd like to toast. Please excuse us for being rude. I hope you don't mind. For your good health. Please drink. This must be poisoned. No way. How could it be? The man you carried out just now seemed poisoned to me. You don't think it's poisoned? Drink it. Come on. Drink it. Come on. Drink it. It's getting fiery. What next? Oh. It's not only the wine. Everything there is poisoned. If you don't want to be poisoned, come drink here. They've got no poison, but there's plenty here. What's going on here? Our boss says, I like you a lot. No. She's the one who likes you a lot. She invites you to her room for a drink. It's quieter there. No disturbances. The smell is nauseating. Innkeeper, bring me some water. I'll vomit if I don't wash off the stench. By the way, the rooms are ready. This way. - Go get some water. - Brother. My room is yours, at your disposal. All right. You are so hot, it's hard for me to refuse. But wait. I need to check them out first. See you. Your Highness. We've brought the steles from Black Water City. What does the inscription read? Your Highness, the inscription is in Xixia characters. After years of wind and sand erosion... the only legible words are Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. The rest cannot be read. But I must report something more to Your Highness. Ever since the two steles were unearthed, they have been regarded as inauspicious. Dragon Gate weathers sandstorms all year. Legend has it that they're related to the steles. Recently, the weather has been very strange. Now that you have seen it... we should return the steles to their position. Then the world will be set to rights. We are just coolies. Please spare our lives. We don't know anything. Spare us. Don't kill us. We don't know anything. Please. We don't know anything. - Please. Spare our lives. - We don't know anything. We know nothing. We don't know anything. - We don't want to die. - Please don't hurt us. My intention was to lure out the snake. But now you have startled it. Your Highness, the coolie wore the same shoes as Zhao Huai'an. We cast an escape-proof net. Yet what it took to break was a shoe. The sword will draw more blood before it's sheathed. Do everything you can to find Zhao. Yes, Your Highness. Search the station. And the stockroom. Bring the caravans to the east wing. Sir. - Harness a horse. - Sir. Chase. Go, go. Whoa. Come on. Chief. - What's the matter? - Does he really resemble me? Your Highness, at first glance the resemblance is striking. But his behaviour is flippant and skittish... nothing like Your Highness's majestic demeanour. He could be useful. We can use him to win by stealth. Go back and tell Tan Luzi to take no action. Wait for my order. We'll lure our enemy into a trap. What trap is it, Your Highness? We'll deploy a fake. I'll disguise as him to draw them out. An excellent plan. It would be prudent to alert us to your arrival. Then we can tell the real from the fake. We cannot afford to make a mistake. We will need a password. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle? And the response, Fake or genuine. Fake or genuine. You must remember the password. If you can't, I'll carve it into your chest. I have it memorised. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. Fake or genuine. Is someone on guard while you three are down here? Everything is in order. The Tartars are watching them in the dining room. Our boss is incredible. Sit down. I'll introduce the members of our team. Our coordinator is Liang Cai, the Shuoyang Demon. Huang, Er Cai and Xinping are from Mt. Pingding. Great. Our guide is Pu Cangzhou, also known as the Wind Blade. He was the one who set us on this trail. And then... And then, we also have Chang Xiaowen... the Grim Reaper, and her Tartar brothers. And my assistant, H'Gantga. 300 years ago, Dragon Gate was the capital of the Xixia Empire. - The Mongols... - At that time... the Mongols besieged Black Water City for a year. Finally, only 108 warriors were left in the city. Before they died... they locked their women, children and gold in the palace. Then they killed themselves for their country. That night, Black Water City was buried by a sandstorm. The full inscriptions on the steles should be read in reverse. Come, cycle, fly, swirl, dragon. Sand, sea, dedicate, god, gate. Come cycle is a cycle of 60 years. Fly swirl dragon is the black sandstorm. God gate is the entrance of the Xixia Palace. The black sandstorm will raise the sand sea... to reveal the buried palace that will give us access to the treasure. Those at Dragon Gate Inn in the past were waiting for the treasure to come to light. But events took an unfortunate turn. The inn owner was a woman. Provoked by a man, she burned down the inn. No one has seen her since. Her name was Ling Yanqiu. So you are... Listen, all of you. The ancient city is filled with mazes. This map shows the way out. The way out? Why the way out and not the way in? Because there's only one way in. You have to get through the mazes on the way out. To get out of the mazes, you need the map. Liang Cai, check the upstairs to see why there are soldiers in disguise. They say they're looking for a woman. Wind Blade, what do you know about it? Apparently, West Bureau wants to execute someone. They are after a maid who has escaped from the palace. I saw two women around here today, but they took off when the soldiers came. They used their own chopsticks. Even if they're our peers, woe betide them if they get in our way. It's our only chance in 60 years. We'd better grab it. The Jade Emperor himself couldn't stop me. The soldiers seemed cowed by Wind Blade earlier. Did they mistake you for someone else? Their boss invited you to his room, didn't he? - It was just talk. - No. They set everything on the table. Why don't you go check them out? - Hey, I'll go with you. - No, I won't go. You can't go. You fought against them earlier. - Then I'll go. - Better not. Their boss drew his sword against you earlier. Then there's no one suitable. Mr Wind, you'll just have to go alone. Alone? What if something happens? Huh? With a name like Wind Blade, you must have some martial skills. I don't need any help, you say? Of course not. If you get into trouble, just yell. We'll all rush in to save you. Isn't that right? Go tell the others. And with a mouth like yours, I'm sure you can yell. Nothing will happen. Don't worry. One other thing. They seem to think you're a high-ranking officer. You can show superiority when you speak to them. Easy to say. Deputy Chief. He's here. I ordered discretion, but you've made yourselves obvious. Even a half-wit could see that you're officials. Yes. Anything to report? Everything is under control. We await Your Highness's orders. Everything's under control. Then why would you need orders? It's total chaos. Your Highness, please keep calm. Your inferiors don't understand. Maybe Your Highness can go over the plan again. Be careful upstairs. - Oh, by the way, Cai. - Yes? When you rebuilt this inn... besides this cellar, did you find any other tunnels? This is how we found it. I didn't see any tunnels. Rumour has it that the woman boss, Ling Yanqiu... dug tunnels and laid traps everywhere. I have a feeling this isn't the only cellar. Maybe the two women we saw are hiding in the secret cellar beneath us. Quick. Quick. Cai. Xinping. Er Cai. Where are you? It's her. She's one of the women we saw. There was another one. What is your plan? The only one who knows these caves so well is the woman who ran the Dragon Gate Inn. Ling Yanqiu. Please tell us again. Just what is your plan? What kind of a place is this, huh? Have you checked the staff? What about all those Tartars? Do you still remember what rank you hold? And why were you sent here? Tell me. Ji Xueyong, seventh in the palace. Absurd. Do I need you to tell me that? What I want to know... is it you who remember the reason why you're here? Of course I do. Yes. If I have not performed well... please let me atone for that by doing better. How would you do that? Huh? Ordered to give poison, you get poisoned. The woman you're looking for got here long ago. But all you do is stay in the room and wait, wait, wait. What are you waiting for? You were after the treasure last time you were here. But the officials tracked you down, so you had to flee. Now you're here with a palace maid. You want the same again? You drew the officials here to deal with us? Have you ever thought I could bargain with these corrupt officials? I can hand the maid over to them. And when they leave, the treasure will still be ours. Tell me. How will you deal with the people here at the inn? We'll poison their animals and leave them stranded here. They'll soon die, and the sandstorm will bury the corpses. None of them will escape. Just be sure that our quarry is amongst them. Why wait for the sandstorm? We could act now. Kill all of them at daybreak. Then we can take our time tracking the quarry. Yes. Who is it? Zhao Tong, back from the courier station. Your Highness, are you going alone? Yes. Your Highness. Wind Blade. You're Wind Blade. You trade jianghu news. We've done business. The imperial court wants me, Zhao Huai'an. Remember me? - What do you want? - You've been recognised. Don't fight. What happened? Who is he? I've waited so long to see you again. For three years, I've pondered the size of the jianghu. It seems infinite. And I've worried for your safety. Three years ago, I picked up the love token you left. Now I can return it. Men are all selfish. - And that's my fault? - Shut up. We agreed when we broke up, we only talk business. Now you regret it? To forestall you, this is the punishment in advance. - Keep it in mind. - Keep in mind. I'll remember it. If you didn't want to see her, why did you come here? I followed the West Bureau men here. I had no idea I'd bump into Wind Blade. They were taken in by his resemblance to their boss, - Yu Huatian. - Their boss? Yu Huatian is in the courier station. His cavalry will arrive soon. No one here will stand a chance. You must be kidding. He is your enemy, but he'd kill us? Why would he do that? Yu Huatian would never let a man go who resembles him that much... to just roam around. But Wind Blade posed as Yu... and tricked his subordinates, which is much worse. There's no way the West Bureau would turn a blind eye. I think Yu Huatian will move at dawn. The first move should be ours... catch him unaware. Our first step is to divide the enemy. One of their guides was poisoned. Let's start with him. Hey, Lu Bu, I'm here to save you. This here is the antidote. The imperial court is done with you. They won't even care. If you still want to live, do one thing for me. I can't fight. I'm in love with my boss, but she only has eyes for that gentleman. Kill him for me, you hear? I can barely speak. How can I kill? Go to the stables and set all the horses loose. He'll be trapped when the sandstorm hits here. He'll die for sure. You're healthy, but you won't do it yourself. It must be a trap. I can't do it because she might see me. I can't risk that. So it's your life in exchange for his. You make the choice. This is only half the antidote. If you don't go along with my request, you still die in three days. For three years, you carried what I most craved. You searched high and low to find me. But fate doomed you to disappointment. I always felt in my heart that you were looking at me. I envied the woman. That's why I carried the flute. She was long gone, but she was always in your heart. She gave her life for me. That's a debt I can never repay. I understand. You didn't see me because you thought I might cling to you. Better lost in jianghu than caught up in the world. I've never understood that saying. Partings are hard... in life or death. Those close to me have left one by one. When I finally leave, I don't want to give anybody sorrow. This flute is for you. Carry it away from this blood-soaked place. Turn away and never come back. What was that for? We count on you to do the next step. I have medicine for her wound. I can help you with your wish. Only when a woman's heart dies can she leave you. That is her only way out. I want to ask you. Why did you burn down the inn for him back then? Actually, I... I'm tired of this desert. Are you really leaving? Stay. Join us in the treasure hunt. There's no place for love in jianghu. Take me there. I talk business, not love. There's nothing we cannot buy with money. I used to think like that. But you can't buy or have what doesn't belong to you. I don't care what I can't buy. You'll understand one day... and you'll change your mind. I know this is my fault. Don't think that you two fooled me. You and he aren't like that. Don't need to try hard. I'll leave. Then take me with you. In case of danger, hide yourself well. If that doesn't work... find a good family in your next life. Then where are you going? I could go anywhere for him. If I stayed, he'd be worried. Deputy Chief. His Highness wants to see you. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. What's that? A slip of the tongue. What does Your Highness wish? When you arrived, did you use a guide named Lu Bu? We did. What about him? This man's been bribed. He's in the stable freeing your horses to trap you in the sandstorm... so that you will all die here. - Xueyong, check the stables. - Yes. Weren't you weakened by the poison? Where did you find the strength to go to the stables? I... Interesting. You've cured yourself. It seems you can withstand any poison. Zhao Tong. Bring him more poison. Sir. Let's see how he does it. Officer. Officer, I am not immune to poison. Someone gave me an antidote, but I only took half of it. So I'm still half-poisoned. Explain. I was given the antidote by the giant called H'Gantga. He... He likes his woman boss, and he wants his rival laid low. He gave me the antidote and told me which horses to free. Report. Two groups are fighting. The Tartar woman and another woman started it. Apparently they're fighting over a man. Now they've started a fire. It may be a trick, but we shouldn't stay inside. Let's see what happens. Tell everyone to go outside. Quick, all of you. There's another box. I've got it, Cai. There's some here too. Get it outside. Then empty the next room. Quick. What else needs to be moved? Come on. It's a trick. Nothing's burning. Zhao Tong, Ji Xueyong. Take some men to investigate. See what's going on. - Yes. - Yes. - Pingzi. - Come on. - Let's go inside. - Take your men that way. The colour of the sky is very strange. Daqiang, check the kitchen. Pingzi, check the stables. The rest of you check downstairs. - You go upstairs. - Yes, sir. They're from West Bureau. Are they real? Very suspicious. Tell me our password. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. Fake or genuine. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. There's more over there. And that one. I've got it, Cai. Don't forget these. Get them outside quickly. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. Hey, what are you thinking? Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. It must be a password. Fake or genuine. Fake... - Fake or genuine. - Officer. Why are you deployed out here? Your Highness, we were told the inn was on fire. We suspect a trick. Our men are investigating right now. How do you assess the situation? No one has reported yet. You've been lured away from your position. Have they left by the back way while you were out here? Yes, Your Highness. Follow them. Deputy Chief, the customers have all gone. We found twitch grass covering tinder. That was what made the smoke. That's bad. They did trick us outside. Report it. There are ambushers outside. Be alert. Ambushers. Be alert. Have the men outside been tricked too? - Let me try the password. - Quick. - Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. - What? Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. Damn you. They're nearly here. I waited until they were close before I came. Good timing. Ready. Go. Go. Deputy Chief, we've discovered that our uniforms have been stolen. Then it's not really His Highness outside. Dragon, gate, fly, cycle. Come again? Cycle? The hell with it. Archers. It's time. Let's move. Four groups... using the inn's location and the wind direction. First group... Cai. You take the best vantage point. Follow the movements of Yu Huatian. Use signals to inform us. Second group... Chang Xiaowen and H'Gantga. Lead your men in an attack from the south of the inn. Make them use up their weapons and men. Third group... Gu Shaotang. You lead the inn staff in a pincer movement. Respond to Chang Xiaowen. Target their martial arts masters. Mind the one in the black mask. His twin swords are lethal. Fourth group, draw out Yu Huatian and lead him to me. - Why did you come back? - To help you. That bowman is covering us, ready to attack. We have to stop him somehow. Yu Huatian is over there. I'm going. You take care of the bowman. I'll deal with Yu Huatian. You'll fight him? You alone? Yes, alone. That's it. That's it? H'Ga, go. The flying swirl dragon. We are fire and ice. Yu Huatian. You dare to fight me inside the swirling dragon? Mount your steed, if you dare. I'll be waiting. Zhao Huai'an. Zhao Huai'an. H'Ga. It's coming. Quick, into the tunnel. Zhao Huai'an. Zhao Huai'an. Zhao Huai'an. Zhao Huai'an. There's a light ahead. It's a reflection. The gold roof of the palace. We found the Xixia treasure at last. Come. I won't leave you behind. Go. Go. Go. - What is it? - Zhao Huai'an. Zhao Huai'an, are you all right? Yanqiu, the dagger he's holding is ultra sharp. Take great care. That's the head, head of West Bureau, Yu Huatian. I'll tackle him. Stay put. I know his fighting style already. Stay back and watch me. Note his weak points. One palace maid attracts so much scum. Not to mention you, you worthless face thief. You impersonated me. You're the worst of all. Enough talk yet? Scum we may be, but we are many now. We'll suffocate you. Give way. It doesn't work. The more people, the more need for strategy. Who will you sacrifice first? All you officials, aren't you all greedy? Everyone knows what you're really like. There's enough gold here to set you up for life. No more worries about your twilight years. No more jockeying for rank and advantage. Your world is a bear pit. Mull it over. Good. You echo my thoughts exactly. Good thinking. What a shame that none of you is a match for me. I can finish off all of you. And I'll end up with all of the gold anyway. No one can find this place. You know why? Because another sandstorm is already on the way. This city will be buried under the sand. On your own, how much gold could you move? This stalemate will cost us our lives and the gold. Neither side has an advantage. Seems like we have a mutual interest, don't we? But some are not here for the gold. They want to fight me to the death. Where does that leave your plan? Here's an idea. We team up together to finish off those two. What do you think? Don't believe his lies. Outside here, wealth won't be his first priority. Didn't he call you scum and face thief? Look. He's the one between you and the gold, not me. It's a shame that you're at such a disadvantage. Maybe I can't get rich. You'll die eventually. If you could persuade him, we might still have time to move the gold. These people all came to get rich. This damned official wants to divide us. He'll easily sway them. They could turn against us. Why are you wasting time if you want the gold? Yu Huatian, why don't we make a deal here? Let's all move the gold out. If you agree, let Gu Shaotang go. What kind of a deal is that? There are so many of you here. How do we do that? You idiot. We all carry what we can. The strongest gets the most. That would put me at a big disadvantage. Fending you off and carrying my gold. I couldn't move much. Why would I agree to such a plan? You are very greedy, but you are too cautious. The gold can't be moved all at once. To reassure everyone, I suggest each group monitors the other two. Yu Huatian, I and Gu Shaotang will stay here. The others move the gold. If we stay, those who carry the gold will have to return. Any other concerns? All right. That makes sense. Once you're outside, don't come back. You intend to perish with him? We've walked so far. Where's the way out? - Is this the wrong way? - No. I'm following the map. The ways in and out are different. We're nearly there. Have you thought it through? Do we really go back for them? You're ready to abandon Gu Shaotang? The world is ours once we get out. If we go back, maybe none of us will survive. Here. That's the way out. I'll take a look. Move the gold up here. A bit higher. Let's get back for another round. What the... She... She... She's been hiding her true face. You could have left. Why are you going back for him? She is an enemy agent. They tricked us. You gave me this dagger. Now you're injured. No one here can match me. You gave Zhao Huai'an your sword. How are you going to fight me? Your skills and schemes can't match mine. - Now I'm going to kill Zhao. - Go catch her. Wind Blade. - Ah, here you are. Give chase. - No further. There's a trap ahead. H'Ga. You hugged that enemy agent. Keep your hands off. - What? - Bu Ludu. Look. There are trip wires over there. H'Ga, what is it? They're very sharp. Some kind of gold thread. They're in real danger in there. They won't let us in, in case we warn Zhao. - Great knight? Great knight. - What is it? It's bad. They're fighting over the gold. Fighting fiercely. Follow me. Up to the roof. There's no hope. They're already fighting. Why are we three staying here? Zhao Huai'an, we just agreed to a deal. Don't you think it's time to renegotiate? H'Gantga. Danger signal. You are supposed to be afraid of Yu Huatian. But that didn't stop you from coming back. Why did I come back? I came to help Ling Yanqiu. To kill you, you fickle man. What's that sound? That is the sound of people... people in love with power and gold. Sadly, it all returns to dust and ashes. Even if you wait a lifetime, the end is the same. Death is inevitable. Your Highness, the wind is back. Let's go. - Almost there. - Yes. - Give way. Let me do it. - Come on. - Here. This way will be quicker. - Good. You really think it was the gold? The reason I made you stay? Go up there first. I already know you made up your mind not to leave here. Be careful where Su passed through. There are traps. Behind you. The thread is lethal. It's you. Where is Ling Yanqiu? Why don't I see her? Where is she? What happened to her? She was hurt really bad and didn't want you to see her die. So she left before you were revived. I leave with you the things I don't want to take. Partings are natural. Why should we be missed? Just tell him I will be free. That's all. Which way did she go? To the south. I must see her. I will find her. Go, go. Go. Go. Well, it's hopeless. Let's go. She gave me the flute. I'll wait for them here. You think they'll come back? Definitely. One cycle. Sixty years is a lifetime. All our planning led us back to these sands. I want to be a very powerful government official. I'll come with you. If they don't come back, come and find me in the capital. I'll be waiting. Treasure of my heart, come here. Kill her. Kill who? Okay. - Your Ladyship. - What happened? Somebody send for the imperial doctor. Your Ladyship. Her Ladyship died. In the 23rd year of Chenghua's reign... Concubine Wan Zhen'er fell ill and died suddenly. Palace records say she contracted a liver disease.
