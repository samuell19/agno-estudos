So? You like what you see? Very much so. Good. You see. - Frank. Frank. I like real men. Damn it, listen! I'm listening. Yes. Frank. Frank. Damn it, listen! I'm listening. Yeah. There are too many people who have claimed to see spirits for it all to be a fantasy. Either they're crazy, or they're lying, or there's gotta be some truth to it. This right here? This I can believe in. All right, if I can't see it or touch it, kinda makes it hard to believe in. I don't have blind faith. That's understandable. Most people think the way you do. And most people have sense, which you lack. I'm just tryin' to plant a seed of possibility in your mind, just an iota of possibility. And? And that resurrection is a fact. That's it, next subject, come on. Christ, man. Well then there's some truth to it. We could just argue about this all night. You son of a bitch. What? Wait, you wanna go out and fuck her right now? Go ahead, I saw the way you were lookin' at her. What look? If I wasn't here you'd be out back fuckin' her by the trash. Wouldn't you? Admit it. - Why the fuck do you gotta be a wench right now, huh? You fuckin' make me sick. Hey! Not here, not again. I'm gonna run to the ladies room, boys, play nice. Whiskey? - Yeah. - Absolutely. All right. She never gives up. Hey, cutie. - I said stop! - Excuse me. What do you think you're doin' with my husband? You bitch! I'll kill you, you little whore. You know what, Chuy, fuck you! Oh, come on. Seriously, Janie? Yeah, seriously. I'm out. Life could be worse, Frankie. Hey. I just needed some salt. Come on, yeah, so what? She's good lookin' but she's not for me. You know what? This conversation is never gonna work itself out. Understand, honey? Oh. Fucking overloaded. Hey babe? - Yeah? How can you see in the dark? How can you crawl up my ass in the dark? How many times do I have to remind you to empty your fucking pockets? I don't know, maybe five or six? Maybe you'll get it at 10. Yeah, oh, 10. What about this, huh? Oh, my wallet. And you didn't take anything out of it. I'm proud of you. - No, I didn't, fucker. And next time I'll put it in the wash. Yeah, go for it. Hey, hey! Would you relax, please? Just go take a bath, take a really long hot bath. - Oh yeah, sounds great. Good. Yeah, so what? She's good looking, but she's not for me. You know what, this conversation is never gonna work itself out. If I tell you I'm not interested, you call me a fuckin' liar, and if I tell you I do wanna fuck her, you say, I knew it. Baby, there's only room in my heart for you. This is pointless. All right, just drop it. Admit it, you just want a hot slut to stick your dick in. Whatever, wouldn't be the first time. Excuse me? You heard me. Now I'm gonna hurt you. Put the knife down, Janie. I'm only kidding. Yeah, right. I said put it down. - I said I was only. - Janie. - I was only... - Put it down now. - Let go of me so I can put it down. - I said put it down! What the fuck? What's he doin'? Let go of me so I can put it down. - I said put it down! - Let go of me. - Janie, put the knife down. Let go of me so I can. Put it down I said put it down now. - Frank. - Janie. - Let go. Hello? Hey, Janie, it's Chuy. Is Frank there? Yeah. God damn it. He knows we have a big shipment coming in today. Yeah, he has a hangover. He's not feeling well. He has a really bad one. He's not gonna come in today. You gotta get his ass in gear! Give him a water, an aspirin, or a shot of whiskey for all I give a fuck! Okay. Just tell him to hurry! Okay, bye. Frank still comin' in? Yeah. Ain't the same without Frank here. I know, Eddie! Fuck! I know that's your gravy in the bathroom, fucker. Just keep moppin', man! Hello, Hair and Powder Beauty Salon. Hola, Ramona, it's Janie. I can't make it in today. Can you cover for me? Cover one of my shifts and I'll cover two of yours, por favor. I'll cover four of your shifts. No, no. . Do this favor for me, please? Okay, okay,. Okay. Okay? It's gonna take me all day, that lazy piece of shit. I was gonna say. It's kinda late to still be at home. Yeah, I know, man. Can you start on one of those for me? You remember how? Sure. Okay man. And all the ones that I fucked up, you can take 'em home if you want. All right. I'm sorry that I yelled before. Can you watch the shop for a little bit? Whatever you say. Yeah, I'll be right back. Put on a hairnet, okay? Really? Okay, okay, yeah. Thanks. Aw man, I ain't, oh! Man, I ain't eatin' that shit! Mornin', Janie, is Frank here? Uh... Frank! You here? He's not here. What the hell is that? It's why we had an argument last night. Where the hell is he? I don't know. He just took off. Just like Frank. Finds the perfect time to pull this bullshit. Yeah, I know. He's got that fighting nature. God damn it! Got any idea where he went? No idea, maybe he's at that bitch Angela's house. I seriously doubt that. I don't think he's gonna be coming back for a while. Why would you say that? It's just not like him to run off. If you see him, tell him to come home. Tell him I'm sorry and I just want him back. Of course, yeah. You all right? Sorry. You need anything? Just drained. One too many fights, that's all. Yeah, no, I understand. Look, if you see him first, just send him over to the meat market. That's where I'll be at, all right? So if you need anything, just call down there, all right? Okay, okay. Get some rest, Janie. Thanks. Then I said, you just better boogie on out of here. - Say, Ned. How's it goin'? Hey, I was just tellin' Ned here about the time I caught my wife cheatin' on me with a jockey. Little motherfucker he was. What can I get you, Chuy? Nothin'. Have you seen Frank? Last time I saw him was with you. Everything good? It's fine, I just, I thought he'd be here. Hey. Sit your fat ass down and have a drink with us, on me. It's a little early for me, I'ma take a rain check. Good evening. I thought we could have a drink together. What? Shouldn't she be at home? I don't wanna be at home. I'm not a fuckin' child. Let's have a drink. And talk about what? Well, I'd really rather not say it out loud. Well give it your best whisper then. I know about Frank. Now's not really a good time. Yeah, well, now's a good time for me. I'll fix that for ya, free of charge. So, invite me in. - Sit. - What am I, your fuckin' dog? What do you want? I was watching last night. What about last night? It was a night of murder. - Of murder? - Yeah. What the fuck do you know about anything? Lady, I don't have time for fucking games. The name's not lady, fuck you. Ooh, why so testy, Miss? The name is Dirk, and it's a pleasure to formally meet you. Oh shit, he's still here? Fuck! I'm sorry man, it's not what it looks like. He's still here? What, are you worried? That is fuckin' disgusting! What's it to you? That's revolting, that's fucking ghastly! Goddamn. Guess that's why it stinks in here. I know. Tell ya the truth, I don't really give a shit that he's dead, but I am gonna need something in return for keeping quiet. Well that's not very nice. Well, I'm not a very nice guy. Ask my wife. So what do you want? A little bit, here and there. A little what? Let's not put it into words now. Why should I, hm? Hm? Hm? That is not the only set. So if I die, the cops will know where to find 'em. So when, now? Sure, all right. He can watch. - No. No, not now. You need to let me think about. Just let me think about it. Don't you take too fuckin' long! Mornin', Janie. Have you heard from Frank? No, what about you? I'm startin' to get worried. You think he went somewhere? I don't know, your guess is as good as mine. Maybe we should call the police. Well he hasn't been missing for 48 hours yet. Aren't you worried? Don't you want to find him? I do, but why would we make it public? I mean, what if he comes back tomorrow night? We don't know. At least check, you could go ask a few places, I don't know. Well suppose he comes back after, after we let everyone know that he's been missing? Everybody would go nuts. I guess so. We'll wait. Okay, I'm runnin' late, so I'll see ya later. Okay, all right, bye. Ah, Chuy. What do you want to know now? My brother, he's missing. His wife said they had a fight and he just took off. That was yesterday morning, and now I need your help. Oh, okay. Okay. Picture your brother. Can you see him? Yes. The deck, cut the deck. What? Sh, sh, sh. Ah. What is it? The cards don't say he's missing. Rodrigo, where is he? Wait. Ah. - What? - Wait. And don't be so uptight. Ah, it's all starting to come together. And? It's the card, the card of... The card of what? Tell me. Why the hell did I come here? Help me. Calm down. Let's finish. Fine. I have a feeling this must be the woman in question. I'm Janie. Yes, come on in. Sit down. I was in the middle of a reading for Chuy. I have something to tell you. Something important and I really hope you believe me. Well say it. It can't be possible. What else is there, murderer? Stop, you already know this is enough for me. Rodrigo's told me things. You wish. You will not remember, Chuy. Aztec rituals. There's a book. So, who's to say? Pick us up at 11, and take care of my car. I'll be here. We'll grow old together. It's time to go, Frank. What are you doing sitting here in the dark again? Shh! What is it? I don't know. What's he doing? Beats me. Maybe they're, like, Satanists. It's probably just a prowler. I don't think there are any Satanists here in these parts. And they're not evil. What, are you fuckin' stupid? Of course Satanists are evil. That's why they're Satanists. Then call the fuckin' police. No, don't call the police, okay? I wanna see what's goin' on. Ya know, you shouldn't snack after dinner. You know you don't sleep good on a full belly. I'm gonna take a bath. See ya in bed? Hm? - Hm? See you in bed? Oh, yeah, yeah, after I finish my sandwich. You fuckin' psycho bitch. Who the fuck are you? Janie. Janie, Janie! Are you all right? Don't be alarmed. Should I? No, no, I want to. I don't understand why she did this. Why didn't she try the chemo? She couldn't have. Look, she ended it her way. All right, come on. And the closed casket? We didn't even get to say goodbye to her. At least we know she's not suffering anymore. Come on, be strong, little brother. She made a choice. Everything's about choices. Yeah, hers may hurt us, but it was still hers to make. Come on. Now we have to leave it up to Mother Nature. I have done what I can do. Now all we can do is wait. Yes. Let's go. Yeah. Oh, you're amazing. Impressive. I love that. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Okay, I'll see you soon. Soon, yes. What are you always doing by the window? What does it look like I'm doin'? Nothin'. Nothing. See anything interesting out there today? No, no, on my days off I like to relax. Mm, take a long, hot bath. Yeah, I'll do that. Well, have fun. I'm off to the salon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Not in the fuckin' kitchen. Not in the stupid kitchen. Look at the flowers. Yeah, whatever. It didn't fuckin' matter to me. What do ya got? Ah, ya cheap fuckin' bastard. Maybe she killed ya 'cause ya buy such shit beer. Huh. Ah, cleaned up that bastard pretty good, didn't they? Fuckin' dead bastard. Fuck. Bitch. You ready to think about my proposal? Just give it to me. Hey, Eddie. Hold on, hold on. We're gonna shut down early today, all right? You can go, I'll close everything down. All right, thanks. No worries. Take care. You, too, I'll see ya tomorrow. All right. This place is a fuckin' mess. Hey, Chuy. - What's up, man? - Can I ask you somethin'? Yeah. Ya know, I've been workin' here for a couple years now, and Frank's never missed a day of work. You'd tell me if there was something really wrong, wouldn't you? Course, man, yeah. It's just the flu, so don't worry about it. He'll be fine. Right. Can ya tell him I said to get better? Will do, man. All right, man. Hey, that shit was real today. - I know it. - Even without Frank. See ya tomorrow. Gon' take a lime. All right, Eddie. Oh shit. There we go. Where the fuck did I put my lighter? Sorry, man, we're closed for the day. - Closed? - Yeah. I mean, it's a little early for that, right? It's only four. All right, you're my last, then. You'll like my business. You're Frank's neighbor, right? Yeah. That's me. Hey man, I quit those motherfuckers three weeks ago. Ever since I've been mean, mean, mean. So, what'll it be, man? 10 pounds of sirloin, 10 pounds of boneless ribeye, 10 pounds of your finest venison, and what the fuck do they call rabbit meat? Well, 10 pounds of that, and I want it for free. Excuse me? Yeah. I said, you'll give it to me for free. You fuck. Yeah. Free meat, for quite some time, and I'll stay quiet. Who the hell do you think you are? Cops might like to know about a certain missing citizen, asshole that he may be. But don't worry, the meat, it's enough. You know, it's not like you killed someone, right? But the one thing I can't figure out is why are you closing early? I mean, it's gotta be pretty hard running the business without your faggot brother running around. You fuckin' piece of shit. - I wouldn't. I wouldn't. Murder doesn't suit you. Okay good, good. This is good. So we'll meet tomorrow and I can pick up my package. What do ya say? Here, six o'clock? Or should I just meet you at the widow's? Hold on, I got somethin' to wet your beak. Oh. Fuck. It's fresh. I like you, man. I like you a lot. Get the fuck outta my shop. Fuck! You said you'd resurrect him. You lied to me. This is bullshit. Watch your tone with me. I did my best. It was my first time. Well figure it out. You knew that Janie killed my brother. That wasn't a wild fuckin' guess. The cards are a very minor, minor skill compared to this. You should be glad I failed. I never should have tried. Well you're gonna try again, and you're gonna try your damnedest. My wife said the book works, so that means it works. It can be done, and just not by me. I paid you, so you're gonna do it. Learn it again, make it work. You're foolish, so, so foolish. What's wrong? Shh. My darling. Geez, just wanted to surprise you. Frank. Frank, you look real sick. Frank. Frank. Maybe it's just stress. You've been going through so much stress lately. This can cause cancer, you understand that? And can get you old real quick.

Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. And then you tell me your deepest, darkest fantasy. Yeah. I've always had this fantasy, you're waiting at home for me.

No, this isn't working. This isn't working, get up, get up, get up, get up. Okay. We're gonna go to the bedroom. - Okay. - Go, go, come on! Okay. I think you know how to behave enough, don't you? Sit. All right, now it's time for the fun to begin. Take off my pants. - Please hear me, just... - Pull 'em down. - Please. - Down! Now it's your turn. No, no, no. Leave the boots on. I like it when they're on. Put the knife down. I'm only kidding. Put the knife down. Let me go so I can put it down. Put the fuckin' knife down, Janie. I'm only... - Janie. - I was only... Put it down now. Let go of me so I can put it down. I said put it down! Let go of me so I can. Put it down, I said put it down now. - Frank, let go. - Janie. Oh God. Okay, okay, this is gonna hurt, but I have to, okay? Okay. Come on, come on, come on. All right, now. Wasn't so hard, right? Right? Now it's time for the best part. Time to see those sweet little titties of yours. - No. - Yes. No. Oh good Lord. You sick motherfucker. Oh my God, Frank! I'm just here to fix the locks. You're dead. I saw her kill you. How can you be alive? - Oh my God, Frank. - I saw her kill you! How can you be alive? I saw her kill you! - Shut the fuck up. - Oh my God! Oh my God. Murderer. Oh, no, Frank. No, Frank. Frank, I swear it was... You're next. Frank, Frank, it's me. It's Janie. Baby, it's me. Frank, it's Janie. It's me, baby. I would never hurt you, I would never do anything to hurt you on purpose. Don't you know that? Don't you? Oh God. Come on, come on, come on. Chuy, where are you? What's wrong? It's Frank, he's back but he's mean. - Oh my God. - Meaner than ever. I can't believe that it actually worked. He tried to kill me and he killed Dirk, that piece of shit. Holy shit. Where are you? I'm at Rodrigo's shop. Okay, stay there, I'm coming to you. You're a genius. Gather yourself, Janie. Tell us what happened. It was Frank. He came home and it was him, but it wasn't him. Oh God, he looked real bad. Bad? Like how? He wants to kill me, Chuy. Oh God, he still thinks I tried to kill him on purpose. And Dirk? He's dead. Frank cut him up, he's dead. Jesus. There's a solution if you feel he's a danger to you. What? Another spell. I'll need to remove his heart and reverse what we've created. It can work because he truly is not among the living, not truly. And you, my dear, will have to eat his heart. Go. Bring him back to me. Go! Let's go, Janie, come on. Okay. Okay. Ah, fuck. All right. Oh fuck. It's Frank. Shit, listen we gotta get outta here. Where? We need to get him. Are you serious? He's tryin' to kill me. You killed him! You're not listening to me. And you're full of shit. Frank, fuck, listen. It was an accident. Tell him it was an accident. Get the fuck outta here, Janie! - No it wasn't! Frank, just calm down, man, it's me. I'm not here for you. I'm here for that bitch. She's your wife. She's a fuckin' murderer, Chuy. My skin is dying. My insides, I'm burning inside. I want her to feel what I'm feeling. We were trying to help you. With the? He put me in the dirt, Chuy, like a fuckin' rat. Get out of my way. What are you tryin' to do? I said get outta my way. Do it. I'm sorry, Frank. Frank, no. Both of you, please get up. No. Frank. Frank. Frank! You're okay. You're all right, come on. Come on. - Let's get him in the car. Yeah. Come on. Rodrigo. I was hopin' Frank just stole your car. Fuck. I'm not touching that book of his. I don't know, Janie. Let's do it without the book. Okay. We have to cut his heart out. No. There's no time to argue. We have to do this. I can't do it, I can't do it. This is not Frank anymore. Help me. Oh God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. I don't believe it. Oh my God. Put me in a ship Oh my God. Oh my God. Janie, eat it. No. Janie, eat the fuckin' heart! Oh my God. Fuck. All right, forget it. You guys cheers. All right, got it. To bad livers. And good looks. Aww, and to my husband. Now that's my girl. Seriously, I'm right here, guys. Oh my God, this. I can't. What's that about? The way he looks at her. It makes me sick. It's as good a place as any. Yeah, I guess. Let's dump 'em. I don't think it fully worked. Oh, don't say that. Chuy, when are you gonna find yourself a nice lady, huh? That is the question. Nothin' long term for me, though. I think I'll take my chances with good old-fashioned lust. Frank. Frank. - Baby. - No, sorry. I'm just wishin' we can get away from here for a while. Sail down to South America, Caribbean. Doesn't matter where. Just you and the sea, breeze and peace of mind. This is where he would've wanted to be anyway, by water. I can't say he's too happy about his company, though. Come on.
