You okay, ma'am? Yes, fine. Got ya. Bastard. Don't hurt me, it's just a joke. Slick, she can't hurt you, it's not in her job description. I'll show you what hurt means. What's going on here. Nothing. Dr. Spanner, we're just having some fun. You call this fun? Slick, you know, better than that. I knew this was a bad idea, bringing these crazies back to Camp Blood. Blackwood, Camp Blackwood. You worry about the grounds and I'll worry about our clients' welfare. You kids stay away from me, you hear. That was a stupid prank to pull, someone could have been hurt. That old bag is crazier than us. No one here is crazy. You're all suffering from PTSD. But I can't help you, if you engage in shit like this. Sorry, Doc, it's okay. Come on Slick let's go inside. Good idea. We have a group session soon. My mum and dad had a garage, north side of the lake, and they were really never going to fix anything anyway, didn't matter anyway, because the clown chopped 'em up one evening. I was late getting to the garage 'cause I smoke pot and my friends and go figure, who could think marijuana could save somebody's life. I'll never forget the sight of it, it's totally different when, you know, somebody is murdered on TV than in real life. Fuck that clown, I hate him. My father was Marty Banks. He was a celebrity of sorts. He had a TV show. They did investigations on paranormal, witches and stuff. He was doing a show on ghosts, the ghost of the Camp Blood killer, specifically. It took it's toll on him. The police say that he murdered a bunch of interns, he had working for him. He's doing life plus 30 years. He's insane. I never really believed in ghosts, but I do now. I don't think the soul of a killer ever really dies. I have this reoccurring dream, my stepmom and her boyfriend at the time, druggy, we're out on a boat on the lake. I see them and I yell to them but they don't hear me. The clown is on the boat somehow. He kills them both. I yell and I yell but I'm powerless to stop it. I try to run, but the clown is right there. This dream, this nightmare plagues me every waking moment. I wanna die, but, I'm too screwed up to even do that. Are you taping now? My best bud was a chick. Yeah, a chick, what are you snickering about, asshole? You probably don't even have any friends. Just coming home from college. She never made it. She vanished into thin air. I know it was the killer clown. My life is torn apart. Yeah, life sucks. Hi Judy, I'm Dr. Spanner, welcome. It's okay, you can carry it. I'll need you back here in two weeks, about noon on the 13th. You got it, Doc. Damn crazies, every last one of 'em. This will be your room, Judy. Take your time getting settled in, we'll all get together later for a meeting. Others. There are more people here like me? Yes, unfortunately. Ripple effects of the murder spree reached far and wide. Oh, sure. Key to your door's on the dresser. What are you doing here, this is private property? I'm just passing through, I'm looking for work. There's no work around here. I take care of this camp. I'd be careful traveling around these parts. Why is that? There's a homicidal maniac on the loose, right in this area, a clown, a killer clown. I happen to like clowns. You wouldn't like this clown. He'd cut off your head and hang it from a tree for a trophy. Then he'd drink your blood. I doubt that. Why are you packing heat? In case I run into a bad tempered clown. I'll be seeing ya. Fucker. Come on, I'm not playing games, come on. I'm done playing. Come on now, show yourself. I'm not afraid to kill anyone. I've done time and you're on the fucking score card, let's go. Yeah, that's what I thought, fucking pussy. Come on. Well folks, the point of group therapy, is someone talks besides me. What's the point? We all know the killer clown fucked us up, directly and indirectly. That's why we're here. Our doctor's couldn't fix us, could you give us a pill or something? No, that won't help you deal with a mental anguish you face every day. It will help if you talk amongst yourselves. Have you ever had a close encounter with a clown? Yes I have. We're not here to talk about me, we're here to talk about you. Figures. Fair enough. I know all of you, in one way or another, have been victims of the reign of terror of the clown. So have I. You seem normal enough. What's the deal? I mean, the state gave us to you for two weeks. Give us the dirt so we can all feel connected. I was 16 years old. That was like a hundred years ago. Can you let him talk? Maybe some of us wanna get better. Whatever bitch. It was late, I was out partying with some of my friends, he hit me from behind. I woke up in an old garage, tied to a chair. The clown was in front of me and he had a knife and it was already dripping with someone else's blood. Damn, I think I've already heard enough. All I could see were his dark, dead eyes. All I could hear was his breathing. He started to cut me, and the pain was excruciating. I thought it was the end. Police sirens and soon there were cops everywhere, and they were calling for Stan Cunningham to surrender. I could tell he was torn, he wanted one last victim. What happened next? The cops bust in. I closed my eyes, it sounded like a war zone. Then they popped 60 rounds into him. I opened my eyes, he was laying dead at my feet, those eyes still staring at me. So you see I'm not just some blank face, taking notes on a clipboard. I walked in your shoes. I know what this curse is. Why can't we bury it, let it go? Why does it control us? Because he was evil, just pure evil. That's hard to erase. But we're gonna try. I can't promise you anything but I'm gonna walk beside you. Cool, man. I'm gonna try. I'm in. Me too. I'm in. Great. Some of our therapy may challenge you and your fears. But a final outcome is what we're striving for. In the meantime. Here it comes. So part of your stay here includes earning your keep. So each of you will have certain chores. Judy you'll be on dishes. Rudy, you're in charge of keeping the pond clean. Camp Blood pond. Slick, you'll help Edna. No way, that chick's crazy. Roger, you're in charge of laundry. He's not touching my underwear. Breakfast is at eight, lunch is at 12 and dinner's at 6:30. And what are you tasked with? Keeping all of you out of trouble. Slick, this is a tobacco free facility, put that out. Sounds more like a convent to me. Next week's edition of "Voices From Beyond" will be our finest hour. We have a hauntingly good treat in store for you. We have an exclusive date with Stan Cunningham, the Camp Blood Killer. Yes, you heard me correctly. We will talk to the infamous killer, to see if we can get answers from his twisted mind, and even get answers to many of his victims, still missing and unaccounted for. Join us for the most important hour of the year. Stan Cunningham, AKA, The Camp Blood Killer. Reportedly to have slain over 27 people, all in the vicinity of Camp Blackwood, known by locals as Camp Blood, the now infamous area off limits to anyone. No one knows what drove him to commit these murders. Some say it's a jealous rage, over a scorned lover. Others boil it down to a mad blood lust, unchecked and out of control. His weapon of choice were various long bladed machetes. Sometimes an ax, sometimes his bare hands. Each murder was bloody and vicious. Several clues and tips led authorities to Stan, who was gunned down in a dark alley. Even to the end, as they say, he brandished his machete. No one knows where his body is buried. Well, my friend, you're gonna make history again. Now that you can be of no harm in this world, we'll see what you can tell us from the other side. Hi, we never were officially introduced. I'm Rudy. Sorry, I had to freshen up a bit. I'm Judy. Nice to meet you. I guess asking what brings you here is probably not the best ice breaker question. Yes, I suppose it would be. Okay, what do you think of the doctor? I think he wants to help, but. But you don't think he can? Yeah. Me too. Really? We think a lot of like. I have to wonder though. Wonder what? If the Camp Blood clown is really dead. The cops shot him, that's what Dr. Spanner said. Yeah. And the reports are that he was cremated and buried in some secret place. And you think his spirit haunts this place? Wasn't your dad into that kinda stuff? Yeah, he was, a little too much. I don't really believe in that kinda stuff. You know what I think? What? I think he wasn't really dead. I heard rumors verified by people in the know, that his body disappeared on the way to the morgue. Someone stole his body? No, he jumped from the back of the meat wagon. And you know what else? What? I think I saw a clown. Holy crap, where? Back by the tree line, when I was outside earlier. But I didn't say anything to anyone or else, you know, someone would think I was. Crazy. Yeah. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm paranoid. It's okay. Let's keep our eyes peeled these next few weeks. You're right next door right? Yeah, I am. If you see or hear anything weird, just knock on the wall twice and I'll knock back and we can come out here and meet and we'll investigate together. No, one's safer out here, especially after dark. That sounds like a plan. I'm may knock three times though. Well what do three knocks mean? It means I'm scared and I might need someone to read me a bedtime story. Let's just stick to two knocks. I'm just kidding. Good night. Good night. Oh my God. What is it? Someone just passed by the window. If you take your eyes off that smut for two seconds, you'd notice the prowlers wandering around. Well? Well what? Get out and see who it is. What for? It could be those kids come back to steal our wood again. We scared them off. They ain't showing their faces around here again. Oh is that that right, genius? And just how do you know that? I just do, a man's intuition. You don't even know what that word means. Now, get your out there and find out who is trespassing. Asshole. Bitch, there, ain't nothing out here. It's all there, that woman is whacked. All right, who's there? Come out. If you come out now, I won't hurt you, too badly. Jeb, where are you? You better not be sneaking some booze, the doctor says it's bad for your kidney. That idiot will be the death of me. So is there anything by the woodpile or not? Oh my God. No, it's impossible, you're. Dead, yes. They clown, he lives on. Go before it's too late. Son, you must go. You are in grave danger, death awaits you. Mom. Heed your father's warning and leave Camp Blood. And we know you smoked pot. Welcome to Camp Blood. Tommy. Tommy, stop screwing around. This was on the porch. Didn't get there by itself. What, are you accusing us of putting it there? I'm not accusing anyone. I'm asking. Does anyone know how it got on the porch or did anyone put it there? I know how it got on the porch. Well? The clown did it. I saw, in the yard last night during the thunderstorm, he was holding that. Are you serious? I'm only telling you what I saw. Okay, Judy, thanks. This sort of thing isn't funny. It undermines our work. I can see this is going nowhere. Everyone finish your breakfast. What's on the schedule? Today, we're going for a hike. Okay, Doc, why'd you have us walk through the forest in the middle of nowhere? Most of the trauma is centered around Camp Blackwood or Camp Blood, as it's come to be known. This is where the clown stalked, we're at the center of it. He took a piece of you. Now, I want you to go into the woods at distance and bring me back something that reminds you of the killer, a piece of him, so to speak. I don't get it. You will. Now go out and search and then meet me back here. But don't wander off too far. Yeah, I'll kick that motherfucking clown's ass with this stick. God, I love nature. Yeah, man, this reminds me of the Camp Blood clown. So, what did everyone find? I found a big stick. Slick and stick. Great. And why did you key in on that particular item? Yeah, I picked this up 'cause I felt I could beat that clown senseless, in my dreams and in reality. I have this rock. I can throw it at the clown from the lake shore and knock him out. He'd fall in the water and drown. My step-mom would still be alive. Great, great. Rudy, what did you find? I found this old knife in a barn somewhere. The clown would be fighting me on even terms with this by my side. I grabbed a pine cone. Awesome. Great. And why that item? I'm gonna shove this fucking pine cone, so far up his fucking ass, he's gonna fucking choke on it. That's wonderful. Don't any of you realize what you just did? Don't you see, you walked off feeling like victims. And when you came back with your items, you came back fighters. You made your first real progress, all of you. Ready to face the damage caused by the clown. You aren't victims anymore. Yeah, for the first time, I feel like I could beat him, even if he were real. Hey, thanks, Doc. All right. Let's head back to camp and start our chores. Oh, you're not gonna narc on me, are you? I don't care if you kill yourself with those cigars. Hey. What? Give me one. If you and your snot nose friends were smart, you'd clear out of here right now. Why this place has been a breath of fresh air for all of us. You're in danger. Don't let that crack Spanner lull you into thinking that clown is dead, he ain't. How do you that? I seen him, prowling around the camp at night, waiting, watching to see the next time he'll strike. Are you sure you don't need therapy? I'm perfectly okay. It's Spanner, you need to be careful about. Why? Just heed my warning. Now put up that cigar and get your ass back to work. God damn kids. The mask is missing. Hey, Judy, done with all your chores? I thought I'd take a break. Do you think we'll ever be cured? I think so. Dr. Spanner really opened my eyes today with our session in the woods. It was a small victory but do you think it'll last? Wars are won by the sum of their battles. We're not done fighting. You have a cool way of looking at things. I like that. Thanks. Edna, we need to talk. What's your problem this time, Spanner, one of your frosted flakes go a wandering off and you want me to go look for 'em? I want you to leave. What, why? You broke into my office and took that clown mask. I did no such thing. You're drunk, I can smell the liquor on your breath. You're a detriment to this facility and to the progress of my patients. And you're always spouting this Camp Blood gospel. This is it, this is the last straw. Don't accuse me of taking anything. Obviously one of those damn kids did it. They don't have access to my office and you do. You can't fire me, you don't have the authority. But your parole officer does. You didn't think I knew about your prison stint for aggravated assault, did you? You asshole, I did my time. I don't need a drunken, flunk of MD, ruining it for me. Too late. I wanna kill that bastard. Well, we can let Dr. Spanner lead us around on a leash or we could take matters into our own hands. What are you getting at? I wanna do some searching of my own, in these woods, these structures. I think it would do a lot to help our cause and satisfy my own curiosity. I don't know, Judy. Are you afraid? No, of course not. I'm not afraid. Well then are you going with me or am I going it alone? No I'm in, what's the plan? Let's wait until everyone goes to sleep and then I'll come get you, say around 11:30. Hope I can stay awake that long. Okay, it's settled. Damn nosy kids, I'll teach 'em all a lesson. Fuck. Just in case I do fall asleep. Okay. Randy, is that you? Why are you dressed like that? You got us good, the fun is over. Wait, there's something wrong with him. Shit. Let's get outta here. Hopefully I can make you proud this time, Dad. Dammit. Edna, I have your cleaning supplies. Come on, I don't have all night. Okay, I'm coming in, I hope you're not shagging the gardener. Man, what a dump. What the hell? It's Roger. Rudy. No, it's Roger. Hi Roger, what is it? I was just wondering if you'd like to take a midnight walk me, maybe? No thanks, not tonight. Why, why not? Come on. We're not allowed outside after dark. I know. You'll get in trouble. If it was Rudy, I bet you'd go wouldn't you? What's that supposed to mean? I see the way you look at him and the way he looks at you. Are you spying on us, creep? Oh man, I really got to work on my people skills. Judy, the power went out. I know, I was in the kitchen, I'm worried. The power probably goes out here all the time, we're in the middle of nowhere. No, I got the flashlight and I looked around the house but I didn't find anybody. Could they be outside, doing some midnight therapy session? I don't think so. All right, let's go find Dr. Spanner, he'll know what to do. See, I told you no one was around. Where's Spanner's office? Back that way. What is it, kids? You don't look so good. I'm fine, it's just a reaction to some medicine. Yeah, sure. Can I help you with something? Everybody's missing. What do you mean missing? Gone, vanished, nowhere to be found. Have you checked their rooms? We checked everywhere inside. Did you check outside? Someone's on Edna's shed, let's start there. Are you sure you wanna do this? Do we have a choice? Give us some light. He's back, the clown is back and he's killing everyone. No, calm down, we don't know that yet. Dr. Spanner, what should we do? Get back to the house, call the police. There isn't cell service. There's a landline in my office, that should work, now go. What about you? I will be fine. So, you've finally come home. Run and hide, I'll keep him occupied. I can't do that. If we split up, he can't get us both. When the coast is clear, run like hell in to town. Be careful. Come on. What do you want from me? Not yet. I think he wasn't really dead. But. I heard rumors verified by people in the know that his body disappeared on the way to the morgue. Someone stole his body? No, he jumped from the back of the meat wagon. And you know what else, I saw a clown yesterday. Holy crap, where? Backed by the tree line, when I was outside earlier. Look, I didn't speak a word of this to anyone. Rudy. Did you get him? Shh, take it easy. I need to know. Yes, he's gone. Who was it? I don't know, it doesn't matter now. I'm really cold, I'm cold. Freezing cold. Did you get him. Rudy. Hello Judy, you ready for another session? Oh my God. Not quite, I'm flattered though. It's been you all along. Yes. I see you met the real Dr. Spanner. I got here early, so we sort of traded places. I was pretty convincing, didn't you think? Sick. Sick. Yes, yes, yes I'm very sick, very sick. My real name's Jared, Jared Cunningham, sound familiar? You're related to. Yes, Stan was my half brother. I was older than him, so I was in the nuthouse for raping and killing two women, carving them into pieces, so I was already locked up when his killing spree started. Why? Well, Judy, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? I mean, I guess you could say killing is in our blood. Of course I had to avenge my brother's death at the hands of the local police. And I was already on my way here for more treatment, so, who can pass up the opportunity? You could've changed, you could've. Oh hell that's too much work. Nothing justifies what you've done and you're not going to get away with it. And who's gonna stop me, you? I don't think so. The killer clown at Camp Blood is a legend. Legends never die. What's so funny? Don't you get it? What? We're all related, one big unhappy family. The children of Camp Blood. No, that's not true. It is Judy, it is. Give it some thought. You know what I think? What is it, my child? I'm putting myself up for adoption. Jared. Jared, Stan made you half a man. Jared, come and kill me if you can. Jared, Stan made you half a man. He'd have me cut to ribbons by now. You can't even kill someone right. You're right, we are the children of Camp Blood. Why fight it? Yeah, I know. We have a lot of work to do.
