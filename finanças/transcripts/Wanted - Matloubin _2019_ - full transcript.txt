Forty-six. Who has 46? - Twenty-eight. - I have it. Great! Fifty-nine. Who has 59? I have 59. - Bravo, Doodi. - Well done, Daad. Check out this handsome guy. I wanna invite him to dinner tonight. Really? Where will you invite him to? The clinic? We'll run away. Get a bit of action. A bit of action? Have you lost it? That's second rule on the list of prohibited things. Second rule? I don't even know the first one. The second one says that only our families can visit us, but we are not allowed to go out. We're in Lebanon, dear. Who lives by the rules? Tell me, how do I look today? You look great! Like a doll! A doll? I heard you! Listen! If you even think about coming near him, I'll break your legs! Understood? Dinner, really? Dream on! Thirty-six. Three and six. Badri? Wake up! Who has 36? - I need 13 to win. - What did you say? Thirteen! - I don't understand what you're saying. - I forgot my denture in my room. - Okay. I thought I was going deaf. - Come on, Walid. Twelve, who has 12? Why 12? I told you 13. I don't need 12. Seventy-four. - Bingo! - Bingo! Unbelievable. She always wins. Calm down, Walid. Take a deep breath. You're too old for these games. You'll have a heart attack. I'm sure there's something going on between them. He always calls all her numbers. It's not fair. Look at the standard of women these days! What if I do the same? Would I win? Seriously? Here comes the witch! Move it, it's time to sleep. Back to your rooms. - It's the last round. - Forget about it. Move it. To your rooms! The nurse will come to give you your medication. Faster! Everyone, to your rooms! Let's go. Hey you, Schumacher. Move it. Faster. - We were having fun. - I'll deal with you later. Let's go. Come on. Hey, Lucienne? Still waiting? Keep on waiting! Come on, Lucienne. Time to sleep. - Let me stay a bit. - No, it's getting late. My children promised to visit me today. Maybe tomorrow. Will they come tomorrow? - Let's hope so. - Yes. Mrs. Mona? Time for medication? Doodi? Would you like a small massage before you sleep? Let me change first. Adeeb? You're still here? This is outside visiting hours. My legs hurt! He's not doing anything wrong! The poor guy is giving me a small massage! To your room, poor guy. Kareem, what if you finish your round and pretend you didn't see me. Adeeb! You know that I help you when I can, but tonight, Beauty is here. - My beauty is here too. - Our Beauty is different than yours. If she finds out what's going on, I'll lose my job. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Adeeb. Move it. Good night, Daad. She's not going anywhere. You'll see her tomorrow. - Kareem, every night you say "tomorrow." - Tomorrow is coming. She's a real ass, this director. What's her sign? Bat or owl? Both of them. I haven't seen her smile, not once, since I've been here. I'm not even sure she has teeth! She has nothing at all. - Adeeb? - Yes? You're still here? To your room, now! - Go on! - Good night to you too! Very nice! - I hope she doesn't wake up. - Let's hope so. - Don't forget about tomorrow. - The red roses and the card. - Yes, and… - The lovely words. I have been using this trick for 60 years. It always worked with women. It'll work for another 30 years. You're still young. Now, I need you to sleep well. - Good night. - Good night to you. Bonne nuit, Adeeb. Good night, sweetheart. Such a darling! "You're the prettiest rose of all." Asshole! Son of a… - I'll tear you to pieces. - What are you doing? You have no right! This is private stuff. I don't give a damn. Listen! If you get near him, I'll throw your false teeth in the toilet. Understood? Adeeb? Where are you? You know he comes to my room every night, to massage my feet and ease my water retention. Isn't that a sign of love? What are those? He would never massage your feet. Look at their shape. Your toes are mangled and distorted. You should be ashamed of yourself. Man snatcher! What's wrong with my toes? They're beautiful. All men are alike. They're worthless. How dare he? He sent her the same flowers and card. Can you believe it? Men! They're all crooks. Why do you think I never married? They're all stupid. All they think about is that little thing between their legs! Why did he do that? Because she's younger? They all go for younger women. I'll teach them both a lesson. She may be younger, but I'm sexier. Of course, she's no match. Did you see her toes? You should have seen me 50 years ago. I looked like a top model, like the ones you see in magazines. I weighed about 30 kilos less. And taller by 30 to 40 centimeters. Really? Where did all that go? Don't you know that people shrink with age? Yes, but you didn't shrink, you crinkled. What? You don't believe me? Of course, I do. You're great as you are. It doesn't matter if you're tall or short. If Adeeb can't see that, there are hundreds of other men. I just remembered. You'll see what I'll do to him. Adeeb! My love, my life. I miss you so much. My love. I'm going to kill you! Wait! Let me explain, Doodi. Don't call me Doodi! Look where this brought us! My sweetheart! My love! You know you're the only one. You and only you. It's Kareem's fault. He sent the roses to someone else. Liar! I got my roses this morning! True. But I asked him to send you two bouquets. - Why two? - Because I love you double. Listen, dumb-ass. You'll go to that fat ass and tell her that the roses were meant for me. Or no more massage! Everything will be over! Even… you'll be dreaming of touching my little toe. No! That's too much to take! I can't bear losing your beautiful toes. Come on! Go! Why do you think your children sent you here? Because they don't want you anymore. You became useless, so they dumped you here. My sweet little beauty. Who's the most beautiful dog in the world? Who? My little boy! My tiny little dog! Love you! Tell your son, he's two days late. If he's not paying, he can take you back. The waiting list is long. Stand up! The waiting list is longer than you. Sit! My son didn't recharge my phone. Can I use your phone, if you don't mind? What? I didn't hear you! My phone? This is not a charity. If everyone uses my phone, my monthly bill will be huge. You think I'm the president? Go on. Go! Ask one of your friends! Go on! - Are they bothering you? - Thank you, Mrs. Amar. Oh, my sweet little doggie! Badri! Get over here! Hi Zeina. How are you? I'm fine, but you don't look so well. - What's wrong? - I don't know what to say. It's the same deal at the end of every month. Mrs. Zeina, can I please borrow your phone to call my son? - Of course. Here it is. - Thank you. He's not answering. Thank you. Take it easy. Relax. He'll call you back. He could be busy. You know what? I have an idea. Wait. Look who's here! Hi, Grandpa! Hello, sweetie. How are you, my love? I'm good. I miss you so much. Miss you too, Grandpa. Close your eyes, I want to show you something. Okay. You can open them now. My tooth is coming out again. Oh, sweetie. That's okay, son. I lost all my teeth. Look! Don't worry. You'll get a new one soon. When are you coming to see me? I ask Dad every day but he's always busy. I know. Your dad is so busy. He takes me to my other grandparents' every Sunday, but I love to see you too. I love you the most. Oh, my sweet boy. Don't be sad. They'll bring you to me. But you keep nagging, okay? Okay, Grandpa. I have to go. Mum is calling me. Before you go, show me your teeth again. I love your smile. - Bye, Grandpa. - Bye, sweetie. - Thank you, Zeina. - Walid, you're like a dad to me. - I wish my children were as kind. - Don't say that. May God bless you. And bless your grandchild. He's so cute. I can't believe it! Am I paying you to chitchat and get a tan? Go back to work! - I was just checking on Walid. - Shut up or I'll deduct from your salary. Go on! The nerve! Come in. - Hi, Kareem. - Hi, Georgette. - Am I disturbing you? - Not at all. Come in. I have a personal question. What? Tell me. I have a special date tonight. - I want your advice. - Great, Georgette. With whom? I can't tell you. Let's see how things go first. And you know… - People envy me. - Sure. - I don't want to be jinxed. - You're too precious for that. Go on. Ask me. - You're a man, right? - Of course, why? I want to seduce him to the maximum. I want him to fall head over heels. What do you think? Should I wear this one? Or… this one? - I do remember that men like red. - Of course. If we were on a date, what would you want me to wear? This one or that one? The red one. The sexy red. Thank you, but not a word. My lips are sealed. - It's our secret. Don't mention it. - Thank you, Kareem. ADEEB Really? You'll see. - Lucienne? Are you up for a tour? - No. I'm waiting for my children. - Just a short tour? - No. Okay. As you wish. Looks like an exciting round. Who's winning? You know my bad luck. Jacko. A letter for you. - Are you sure it's for me? - Of course. You're the only Jacko here. Win for once! Come on. Open it. At least you're getting letters. How come you never get anything from your children? I have a married daughter who's living in Dubai. My son is here, but he's always busy. - He lives here? - Yes. Didn't you know? I thought he was abroad. I've never seen him here. He's 45 minutes away. Your son is not nice. I can't blame him. He's too busy. He'll come eventually. During the past two years, I've never seen him. I'm telling you, he's busy. He has a family to take care of. And you're not family? It's sad when you have ungrateful kids. They've forgotten how hard bringing them up was. They get grumpy if you repeat yourself. All the sleepless nights we spent when they had a high fever, over and over again, till they fell asleep. If only they would appreciate us. They'll know our worth when their kids treat them the same. He's been here a few times, that ungrateful bastard. He's the least of my concerns. I miss my grandson. He sends me his drawings. My sweet boy. Zeina helps me out with a video call sometimes. - So are you going to read the letter? - What letter? Jacko got a letter and she's not reading it. Read it, Jacko. It might be a will. I'm the eldest. They're all waiting for me to die, so they can get their inheritance from me. And I'm sure it's bad news. - How would you know? - The envelope isn't pink. - What's your deal with pink? - My husband. He adored my pink outfits. He called me his "little rose". Oh, God. Hand it over and we'll read it. Stop nagging. I'll read it. "Dear Jacko…" Jacko, what's wrong? Come on, get a move on! - What is it? - Come. Jacko has a problem. - What? - A huge problem. What is it, Jacko? What happened? Tell me. Get up. Move. Jacko, what's wrong, dear? Walid. Read this. I forgot my glasses. Death forgot you. "My dear Jacko, this is Hortance, your neighbor in the village." "I'm writing because I no longer have credit on my phone." "The village store isn't open." She has no credit, that old cow. She's so stingy. She could've reverse-called you. Most people do that. A reverse call? Where from? The home's landline? Forget it. Go on. "My dear Jacko…" Walid, continue from where you stopped. "I decided to send you this letter with someone heading your way." "I got the flu followed by a bad case of bronchitis, it affected my kidney." "I've been in bed for two months." I hope her kidney exploded. Stop interrupting him. Go on, Walid. Walid. You reached bronchitis and kidneys. "I've been in bed for two months." "Some people came, with a big project." "They said the piece of land where you buried your husband is theirs." "They want to pull out the olive tree and build a big mall and a zpa." - What's a "zpa"? - A spa. - Where you go to get a massage. - I'm the king of massage. I'll work for free, if they let me. Stop it. We need to know the story. Take it from zpa. "They asked me to tell you that the excavation will start on the 10th, at 12:00 noon." The 10th is in a week's time. What will you do? There's nothing I can do. They'll dig him up. My love. Your final request was to be buried under the olive tree, which was planted by your ancestors. We should teach them a lesson. I should go to the toilet. - Wait. Hold it in. - I can't help it. Please, leave me alone for a while. Jacko. Your husband will stay under the olive tree. Trust me. Don't worry. You just take it easy. Thank you. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Happy birthday to you Let's hear it. What did you wish for? - A kiss from you! - From me? You're a darling. May you live for a hundred years. She passed that a long time ago. - May you outlive me. - God willing. Hey, Jacko. Let's have some cake. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Come on. That's not fair. You haven't eaten in days. We miss the Jacko that's always smiling. She's dead. Jacko. What are you saying? I'll be back. I know what to do. What are these glasses! I can't see anything. Where are you? - I'm here! - My darling. What's wrong? You said it's important. I missed you. - I haven't seen you in ages. - That's it? I thought something was wrong. I have a lot of work to do. How do you think I'm paying for this? From the huge inheritance you left us? Let's go, son. - Stay a bit longer. - He missed us! What a joke. I want to stay with Grandpa. You can't. Let's go. - Bye, Grandpa. - Bye, my love. Walid. Are you sure of what you're doing? There is no other way. It's for her and her late husband. Okay. This never happened. Who are you? Keep this with you. You never know what might happen. - Good luck. - Wish us the best. Please, keep me informed. Hello Josephine. How are you today? - Not good. - Why? - I feel pain. - Today as well? Let me check you. - Where is the pain today? - Here. This chest pain won't go away. - Where? - Here. - Here? - Yes. Put your hand lower. Take a deep breath. - How was your date yesterday? - It was bad. Don't worry. You're still young. - How old are you? - Thirty-six. - Thirty-six? That's too much. - What's too much? You're too old for me. Look at the wife of the French president. She's 25 years older than he is. Is Brigitte Macron better than me? No way. She's neither older, nor more beautiful. - Dating older ladies is trendy now. - Can you believe this? We're more experienced. So, we still have a chance? I wish. But I'm married. And if she finds out, she'll kill me. Don't you worry about that. - I don't snatch married men. - What a relief. But listen. Don't fall for me. That's the problem. If I fall for you, what do I do? We'll keep it a secret. Okay. Your heart is fine. Thank God. It's beating like a 20-year-old's. - Are you sure? - Totally. But I feel like I'll be sick again tomorrow. I'm not here tomorrow. I'll be back the day after. - Zeina will take care of you. - Oh, Zeina… She's great. But I won't be sick tomorrow. - You know what? - What? I'll get sick the day after tomorrow. - Wishing you a healthy life. - Thank you, Kareem. You're most welcome. Be careful. - Bye, Josephine. - Bye. I'll make you proud, Boss. Calm down. They're on their way. Pink! Jacko! I told you to wear black to blend into the dark. Black doesn't suit me. Look, I did wear some black though. What are you still doing up there? I'm coming. Walid. Do you have the car keys? - You look handsome. - I know. Get in the car. I'll follow. Don't be long. The witch might wake up. What took you so long? I was picking some dresses. There's no time for that! No one knows what might happen. Where to, little doll? Don't sweet talk me. Move. Do you want me to drive? If you drive like you walk, we'll get there in a month. God help us. What a view! Very romantic. - Doodi? - Yes? - What do you call someone from USA? - American. - And from France? - French. - And from Bosnia? - Buss-nian. Do you want to have breakfast before we head off? I'm hungry. I feel like having beans. - Come on. - Where to, darling? I'll get my purse from the car. Come on, Doodi. You're with a gentleman. Forget about money. I saw a small restaurant nearby. We can't stay long. We have to reach the village quickly. Jacko, Lebanon is a small country. We can cross the whole country in two hours. Don't worry. Everything is under control. Let's go, Rambo, and I'll clean your face. Where are they? All these cameras and no one saw them? I don't know, Mrs. Amar. What do you mean? Where were you last night? The four of them disappeared just like that? How is that possible? - It's not, but… - But what? They also stole my car! How did they get the keys from my office? I have no idea, Mrs. Amar. "I have no idea, Mrs. Amar." That's all you have to say? Get lost! Where are you going? Stop. I have to call the police. Let's hope they didn't crash it. It's a brand-new car. Aren't you worried about them? Them? Out of my face! Now! Shit! I just filled it up with gas! Where is the car? Didn't we park it here? Yes. We parked it under this sign. I'm sure we parked it here. That's the car I bumped into while parking. It seems it got stolen. How can they steal it without the keys? - I left the keys in the car. - How could you? Relax, Doodi. In my village, we never lock the cars and they never get stolen. Go to hell, you and your village! Mr. "In Control" or whatever your name is. I wanted to get my purse, but you said no. You wanted to play the gentleman. That's how they repay my noble deeds. Women! You! You're the last to talk. Have you eaten? This only happened because you craved a bowl of beans. I hope you get diarrhea. Bunch of losers. Why are you looking at me? Enough! They'll dig up his grave, and I won't make it in time. - Forgive me, love. - Listen here. Listen here, Jacko. - What's your husband's name? - Faraj. - Faraj? - Faraj? Yes. He was the only boy after seven girls. So his dad said, here comes relief. Listen, Mr. Faraj. You'll stay under the olive tree. We promised Jacko that you would. Can you talk to her, please? We're sick of her nagging all day. Here, he wants to talk to you. How will we get there? Hitchhiking! Leave it to me. Move, let me show you how it's done. Where are you heading? - Jezzine. - I'm going to Beirut. I can drop you off there and you can figure it out after that. Fine. It's better than nothing. Let's go. You won't all fit in the front. Try the back. Don't worry. Us ladies will sit in the front, and the guys in the back. Don't forget to visit me, I'll make you a delicious meal. Definitely, Mrs. Jacko. - Bye. - Take care. Bye. - Thank you. - Take care. He's so cute, a good guy. God bless him. God sent him to us. Now what? No more hitchhiking! I can't feel my body anymore. We should find a way to get money and take a cab. How? Come with me. I know what to do. You're exhausting. Oh, do-gooders, help us out. Come sit and look sad. For the sake of God! Help us, may God help you. Help us out. A penny for the poor. - Oh, do-gooders. - Help poor beggars and the handicapped. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - We're good. - Where are you from? - From Aleppo. Really? I'm from Aleppo too. Where exactly? Aleppo. I got it. I'm from Hamdanieh. What about you? - Well, close to there. - There? - Where? - At the roundabout. - Yes. - There's a white building. A building? I don't understand. Which building? Why are you asking so many questions? All the buildings in Syria are destroyed. Why are you asking? You wanna help or interrogate us? Son, don't be mad at him. He was traumatized during the war. He's still stressed out. Stressed out? Aleppo! So rude! What are you doing here? This is our spot! Beat it! What do you mean it's your spot? That's where we sit! I can't believe her! Can't we beg in our own country? Come on! Beat it! - Move it! Go! - We're leaving. What are we gonna do now? We don't have enough money. - Come with me. - Where to? To the square. It's all his fault. Lock him up. - Mrs. Amar? - Shut up! Ma'am, we questioned him. We have nothing on him. Even if it happened on his watch, there is no proof he's involved. We need their pictures. One moment. Here. - The picture of the runaways. - Why do you need it? They're old rags, they all look alike. - I'll give you the pictures. - And who's this pretty lady? I should question her. This is Zeina. A nurse. She works with us here. More importantly, let's talk about getting the car back. Four of your residents have disappeared and you're worried about the car? Excuse me, but it's a brand-new car. Excuse me again, but I've already lost one night's rent. And I'm not willing to lose more. If they don't show up in a day or two, I'll rent their rooms to someone else. - But... - Don't say another word! It's not you who pays the rent. You know what? That's a great idea. I'll deduct the nights' rent from your salary. Not to mention that… it's a full options car. Weren't you able to locate it with the GPS? Yes, of course. Wow! That's great news. Why didn't you say so? You didn't give us the chance. Where is it? In Brital. Brital? - How much did we make? - Seventeen thousand lira. - Only? - I asked you to strip a bit. You refused. We sang and danced for three hours, just for 17,000 lira. That's it? I'm exhausted. You did nothing. You just collected the money. I lost my breath from all the rounds. As for me, I feel great. Let's rest a bit, then we can move on. You just said you're feeling great, now you want to rest? No, not at all. I'll do some exercises. Exercises? How do you think I maintained this sexy body? I'm taking good care of it. We don't have time for this. If we don't get to the village tomorrow morning, it will be too late. Jacko. We'll definitely get there. I'll train for half an hour. - Not even half a minute. - I have to exercise. - And I have to pee. - You see? Come with me. I'll be done training before he even gets out of the toilets. Jacko. Let's find a supermarket. We'll get some food, and we'll be back by the time they're done. Let's go. We don't need that. Ma'am, are you okay? You've never seen a pregnant woman before? Take me to the hospital. My water broke. Let's hope for twins this time. Lucky her. Hello, miss. Sorry? Hello, miss. Hello. Are you a regular here? I come every day. Why? Can't you tell? No, it's very obvious. - What about you? - Me… I'm here by chance. But I exercise every day, just like you. Can't you tell? It's very obvious. Can I take you out to lunch? Lunch? That's so nice of you, but I can't today. I have to go to work. Work? A beauty like you? You shouldn't be working! - You're so cute. - Thank you. What do you do? I'm in the entertainment business. - I work only at night. - Poor you. Night work is very tough. You're a nurse then. You take care of people. You could say that. God bless you. Jewels like you are rare these days. Listen. The money we have is not enough. We need more money, but how do we get it? Let's pray, maybe God will help us. I'm not a Christian. Just do the cross sign and God will listen. Let's go. Forgive me, Father. Oh, God, you know I've led a decent life. I helped everybody. I was careless a few times, but one learns from their mistakes. I want you to forgive my past mistakes. And my future ones. There are some mistakes still to come that you're not aware of yet. Please, forgive me for those as well. What? Do you hear me? Will you forgive me? What, Father? Did you forgive me? Father? Oh, God! Our father who art in Heaven… Forgive me, God. Oh, God! My hips! Come here. - The priest wants to see you. - But I haven't finished yet. - Leave it to me. - Are you sure? This one doesn't count, I already told you about it. - We're gonna burn in hell. - Stop it. We'll give it back. God, forgive me. I'm getting hungry. All you do is either eat or piss. What can I do? I have a small bladder. Are you done? - Let's eat something. - With what money? - We barely have enough for the cab. - I'm starving. - I'm getting dizzy. - See? If you hadn't forgotten the shopping bags in church, he would've eaten. Look at his pale face. Let's eat. My treat. Eating is fine, but how will we pay? Don't say a word, Mr. "In Control." I'm the boss now, and I'm inviting you. What's wrong with her? - She's taking a selfie. - Where to? - Sorry? - Where is she taking Sophie? - No, it's something called a selfie. - Please explain it to us. It is when you take your own picture. Why is she taking a picture of herself? Everybody does it. It's a trend. And the way she moves her lips is also a trend? What's wrong with her lips? They're beautiful. - Do you want me to tear your eyes out? - Why? What did I do? What did you do? You think I didn't see you looking at her? - Who? - The girl who just passed by. Oh, yes. I didn't even see her. I was looking for the toilets. - Toilets? - Yes, for Walid. Right, Walid? Tell her you need to go. No, I'm fine. Yes. Where are the toilets? I forgot. I'll deal with you later. We have to go. So, no toilets? No, we're late. You have to move now, because you walk like a turtle. What? A turtle? You should have seen me playing basketball when I was young. I was faster than Messi and Ronaldo. You couldn't even compare them to me. Why don't you call me a snail as well? Okay, Ronaldo. Kick the ball outside. - Ready? - Now? Oh, God! My heart! I can't breathe. Jacko. Help! Call an ambulance. Help us! Move away, I'm a doctor. Don't touch her, Doctor. She needs an ambulance. - Let me check her pulse! - Why do you care? You think you know better? She faints twice a week. Just go. Call an ambulance. Excuse me! We missed the dessert. Enjoy! - Sorry. Only family members allowed. - I'm her husband. - Okay. Go on. - I'm her youngest daughter. Her daughter? I know, I look way younger. Fine. Get in. Please, son, I left my phone on the table. Can you get it for me please? You're faster than I am. Sure, sir. I'll get it. Get out or I'll shoot you. Ma'am, I need to take your mother to the hospital. We'll take her. Listen! I'll count to three. If you don't get out, I'll shoot. - Ma'am… - One… - Two… - Ma'am? Two and a half. Two and three quarters. What a beautiful view! Our country is breathtaking. How are you in the back? What's wrong? What's happening? What's wrong with you? I am going to be sick. - We ran out of gas. - What? Calm down, Daad. This time, it's not my fault. What will we do now? A car will end up passing by. Where are you going? Not even a cat passed by in the last hour. It will be dark soon. - I'll search for a gas station. - Stay here. You'll get lost. We've just passed one on the road. - We should stay together. - Adeeb is right. There is no other way. We have to get fuel. Where is he storing them? We're dehydrated. It's his prostate. How much money do we have? Seventeen thousand lira from the square. And 36,000 lira from the church. We'll burn in hell for just 36,000 lira? Don't worry. I told you and I told him that we'll pay them back. Jacko. The village is not far away now. Don't worry. I'll get some fuel, and we'll reach it before nightfall. We won't get there. Stop nagging. We're almost there. Come with me. Listen, if you come back quickly, I'll massage your feet tonight. I'll be very quick. Take care and don't be long. What's wrong? You're a savior. We ran out of gas. I was going to find a gas station. It's closed. Why? It's a small village here. Everything closes early. - Do you have a patient with you? - No. We don't. - Do you have a phone? - Yes. I'm coming. Here you go. Kitty! Thank you for coming. Don't mention it, Adeeb. Get in, quickly. - Who's she? - My friend, Kitty. If she's a cat, I'm a tiger. How do you know her? We met at the gym, and I told her our story. Guys! It's late. I'll take you to my hotel. You can stay the night, and early tomorrow morning the driver will pick you up. Sorry to bother you so much. Come on, Adeebo. It's nothing. Get in, all of you. Can't he drive us to the village now? To be honest, the roads are not safe at night. Tomorrow is safer. The earliest possible, please? Of course. The driver will pick you up at 7:00 a.m. - Let's go. - Hold it. You'll sit next to me. Go sit next to your wife. I'll sit in the front. You little sneaky thing. You didn't tell me you were married. I just found out as well. So? What do you do in life? Kitty helps people in distress. They come to her after work, and they leave with no worries. Is she a psychiatrist? - You could say that. - Come on. Let's move it. Come in. Come in. I'm sorry. It's not a big room. It's great. Don't worry. No one will bother you. If you need anything, I'll be in the club downstairs. Okay? - Thank you, Kitty. Bye. - Bye! How nice of her. She runs a dormitory for girls. I'll sleep on this bed. I can't climb up there, I'll get dizzy. Don't worry. Women below and men above. I'll help you, don't worry. I don't feel like sleeping. It's a small, suffocating room. Let's go for a walk before we sleep. I'm tired and need to rest. I'm tired as well. You go. Really? I won't leave your side. If you stay, I'm staying. You want me to go out alone? Okay, I'll join you. I need to use the bathroom anyway. Doodi? In your dreams! Doodi? Don't think about it! What brought you here? - You can't sleep? - No. What do you wanna drink? A glass of milk for him. Beer, please. Beer is bad for your blood pressure. And milk makes you sleepy. Please, Doodi. Stop bossing me around. I'm a big boy and I know what I want. Two beers, please. - Kitty is so nice, I liked her. - Me too. She's so sexy! The TV show I like is on. Yesterday, this tough guy found out that his wife is cheating on him with his brother and his son is his brother's. Really? Unbelievable. Of course. Women are not the only ones that watch TV shows. I never miss an episode. Breaking news! We just received news from the police department, they're warning people about a dangerous gang of four people, who've committed many crimes, including robbing a supermarket, stealing an ambulance, and also violating a religious place. - Couldn't they use a better picture? - The police issued arrest warrants. Anyone who sees them is requested to call the nearest police station. Kareem, I've been calling their cellphone and no one's answering. The police are asking people not to fall for their old age and not to approach them, as they're extremely dangerous. You see? THE NEWS You see what happens to runaways? They'll end up in jail like scum. - We shouldn't have let them go. - Zeina! They were going anyway. What if something happens to them? You two outside! What are you gossiping about? We're saying you're right. Of course I'm right. I'm always right, for ever and ever. To the moon and back, I am right. Right! Cheers! I love the smell of your cigarette. They're making flavored cigarettes now? Flavored? Sure. Try it. - Try it. - No way, I'm a sportsman. Do it for me, please. Try it. It's delicious. Take it easy. Go slowly. Slowly. I love it, sir. I need another one. My friends are joining us later. - Okay, but you have to pay. - Pay? Pay for one cigarette? You're being stingy. The whole pack is 2000 lira. - How much would one cigarette cost? - Nothing. Ma'am, my price is 30 dollars each. - Thirty dollars? - What? I don't believe it. This is local stuff. Local became more expensive than imported. In this case, yes. No. We don't have any money. Hold on. Look here. What's going on? You see? We asked him for one cigarette, and he demanded money. What? What did you give them? Nothing, they asked for a drag. What? Get out of here. Now! Leave him. Get up. Hear me out. Smoking is bad for your health. You also have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep. I don't want to. I'm in great shape. I want to dance. Cheers! Cheers! How are you guys? This is the best night of my life. I love her and I adore her. The most beautiful woman on Earth. She's the love of my life. Do you want to show her that your love for her is eternal? Eternal? A couple of years and we'll meet our maker. We'll meet him together. - Come with me. - What do you want? - Where to? - We'll be back. No. Where are you going? - It's a surprise. - I want to come along. I hate surprises. You'll get tipsy. Come on. Where have you been? We looked everywhere for you. What are you doing? I'm marking my territory. What's that? What did you do? - You're drunk? - No, just had one beer… And some flavored cigarettes. We have to take them upstairs. Stop coloring his body. I haven't finished yet. I said stop it. As you wish. There's been a disaster. A puff from this cigarette will make you forget all your troubles. Get lost. Forget the cigarette. The police are searching for us. They posted our pictures on the news. Wow! We're TV stars now? We're criminals, and they'll put us in jail. Get up. - Get up. - Come on. Follow me. Quickly. Believe me. This is the best solution. Just tell them the truth. That's it? Good evening. I am Jacko. Me and my friends are not criminals, as they said on the news. My late husband had a final request, to be buried under the olive tree facing our house in the village. Some promoters want to dig him up to build a mall and a spa. We ran away to try and stop them. I'm doing this so his soul can rest in peace. All we needed was to get there. Don't blame my friends. Their only mistake is that they wanted to help me. They're kind and respectful people. I'm the only one to blame. Aya, check this out. - Who is she? - Someone called Jacko. Check out these old people. 500,000 views in a few hours. What a touching story. Would you do the same for me? - Baby, you just die and don't you worry. - You're mean. You think you can outsmart me? You'll see. Darling, isn't that your father? - Where? - Here. - Grandpa! - What is he doing there? They said they ran away from the nursing home to reach the village, and someone is buried under an olive tree. I didn't get the whole story. No one called you from the home? They did, but it was for the payment. Daddy, I want to see Grandpa! Soon! You keep saying soon, but you never take me. We just keep visiting my other grandpa. Why didn't he call me? Because you never answer his calls. Where are you going? I've been calling since morning, still no answer. Oh, God! What the hell! - I'm so worried. - I'm sure they're fine. How would you know? - Calm down, Zeina. - What if something happened to them? - Maybe it's on silent mode. - Oh, God. Is it them? Yes, they stole my car. Go on, arrest them. - Get up, come with us. - Can you arrest us tomorrow? We have to reach the village today, before they start digging. I promise we'll give ourselves up. If they were digging up your dad from his grave, would you let them? You have my sympathy, ma'am, but I can't do anything. If she drops the charges, I will let you go free. - Please, Mrs. Amar. - You, shut up! Criminals like you should be in prison. Calm down. They're not criminals. Aren't you watching the news? - I am, but… - There is no "but" with these people. Come with me, please. Cuff them, they're dangerous. We know what to do. Come with us. Who's this pretty lady? I should interrogate you. You deserve this. I spoke with the owners of the supermarket and the ambulance, they're pressing charges as well. You'll rot in prison. Call an ambulance. What happened? I don't know. She tripped on her way down. Call an ambulance! I just need to ask, if by God's will she dies, will the charges be dropped? No, ma'am, there's the public right. Miss. Get well soon, Mrs. Amar. Jacko has been arrested. I call you all for a protest. You look familiar. Who's your dad? You're Yousef's son, right? Who's Yousef? - You already forgot? - But I didn't forget you. What's this "I love D"? She could be anyone. Donia, Dalal! Where's Daad? Baby, why are you upset? Come back anytime and I'll fix it. Did you hear that? We have to fix it. What happened to you, my dear? Who stole your clothes? Jacko! Jacko! More are coming! We need back up. I already called operations. I've let them know. Ladies and gentlemen, today's story has started an uprising in the country. The whole world reacted, even in Europe and China. The story of Jacko and her friends who decided to help her, to cross half the country, to reach her late husband, buried in their garden, under a 200-year-old olive tree so his soul may remain in peace in his own land. Unfortunately, their trip led them to prison. Now, we'll go to Charbel, who is outside the station, for further details. Go ahead, Charbel. As you said, Diana, the story of Jacko and her friends touched so many people. More and more are joining in, especially since they heard about the arrests this morning. I'll talk to them to see why they're here. Diana, with us is the actor Badih Abou Chakra. Why are you here today? This is a humanitarian story. We should all support Jacko, and release her from prison. She did all this for her husband. My kids are with me, so they learn the meaning of sacrifice. I wish my wife would do the same for me. - We're all Jacko. - Thank you, Badih Abou Chakra. We also have Tony Baroud with us. Why are you here? I'm here to support the oppressed, and Jacko is. She deserves a statue. She represents the loyal wife. She stood by her husband in his life and in his death as well. Jacko is a role model to us and to generations to come. We're all Jacko. I am Jacko! Look at me, are you Jacko? Are you? And you? We're all Jacko. As you see Diana, everybody here is supporting Jacko. I'd like to add, no official statement has been issued from the authorities and that's what we're all waiting for. - Diana. - Thank you, Charbel. This story makes us realize that love, loyalty, and true friendship are things we can't give up. And now we'll bring you scenes of people who reacted to Jacko's story from all around the world. ISF, yes? Yes, sir. Right away, sir. I'll inform them. Let's go. Daad, Walid, Adeeb, Jacko. Come with me, please. - Where to? - Another facility. - Why? - For security reasons. Where to? Sit back down. It's your turn soon. And you. Pretty lady, don't move. I have to interrogate you. - Jacko, come with me. - Mr. Officer? - Can I ask you a favor? - Sure, what can I do? Pull out your gun and shoot me. I want to die. Come with me and all will be fine. Come. Where are we going? - You didn't guess? - This is the road to my village. What are you saying? - We got an order to take you home. - Order? - From whom? - From the highest authority. - Great! - Wonderful! What about the charges? The supermarket and the restaurant owners both dropped their charges. They're so happy. You were their best publicity ever. They're always full now. And the ambulance? It's intact. We found it and returned it. - Thank God. - The church money? The priest forgave you because your intentions were good. But he wants you to repay all the money to charity. That was our intention. He wants you to recite the Lord's Prayer 50 times, and Ave Maria 50 times too. - Even 100 times. - What? One hundred? I don't know them. I'm not a Christian. Don't worry. I'll teach you. Your reward in God's eyes will double. Okay. What about the supervisor? She's in the hospital. - We'll deal with it when she's out. - Thank God. To hell with her. God is great. Jacko! Your husband will stay in his grave. Jacko! Your husband will stay in his grave. Turn it off. - What's going on? - You need to stop. - Why? Our papers are in order. - We received a no dig order. - Have a look, they're legal. - I don't care. What do you mean? You bastards! I'll show you. FARAJ EL HELOU Rest in peace, my love. No one will bother you anymore. Grandpa! My darling. I missed you so much. - How are you, sweetie? - Fine. - Who brought you here? - Daddy. Adeeb, what's wrong? Your blood pressure dropped? Will you marry me? - What? - I love you, marry me. On one condition! No kids! I don't want my boobs to get saggy! I want to keep my figure. - We're shooting! - Stop it. How can he stand it? May she live to be 100 years old. - We didn't say "action". - She didn't say "action". What does "I Love D" mean? Could be anyone. Dana, Donia, Daad! - Why are you laughing? - You could be "Daad"! Oh, God! My heart! One moment, let me… - Put some sunglasses on? - I'll put on some sunglasses… - Look, Firas. - Let us bring the camera. - The pretty sunglasses… - These lot get high before shooting. Especially her. She was like this in the ambulance, and now today, what can I do? Come kiss me, come. No way! - What did you want to do? - I wanted to tease your wife. - Make her jealous. - Vanessa? Vanessa? She is right. Up, like this. Be careful. Now she brought me... What d'you want? - It's beer. - No! - What's wrong with you? - No, no one is drinking alcohol. Why are you angry, Daad? I'm angry because she took the beer, even though I'm thirsty! Is she worried we'll get drunk? Does beer get me and Georges drunk? We'd need a few whiskeys to get drunk. What do you think of the set, Nebal? She's in charge. She's got us by the throat, boss. I can feel my heart trembling, because I feel… - C'est bientôt fini. - Could you stand near…
