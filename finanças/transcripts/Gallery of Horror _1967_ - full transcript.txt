All down through the ages certain people have been said to possess certain strange, magical, mysterious powers. Some of those, it is said, have powers for good, and they were venerated. Of others it is said they had black powers, and they were feared and despised. Some of those who were thought to have these black powers were called witches and warlocks. They'd summon demons, make all sorts of magical potions, even call down curses upon people and specific objects. Even whole towns began to feel and fear the effects of curses. People began to be terrified by witches, even potential witches. They were afraid of any curse from any source. Eventually...fear turned to violence. People became more afraid of cursing than the physical person of the witch or warlock. If someone died strangely, he was said to have died of a curse. Crop failures, plagues... everything that went wrong... a curse was blamed. People thought that if a curse was put upon a person that curse would last until that person died. Or if a curse was put upon an object, that curse would last as long as that object was in existence, unless it was specifically revoked. People lived in abject fear until finally one brave man rallied his townspeople and turned on a witch. The violence spread. Everywhere, witches and suspected witches, were set upon and burned. The hysterical witch hunt spread to America where hundreds of people were burned by fear-crazed mobs. Even innocent old men and women who had never harmed anyone, unable to reason with the people, met the same horrible death, some shouting their innocence, some screaming imprecations, obscenities... and threats of eternal revenge, and some stoically and calmly, and strangely silently meeting their end. One of those who was burned at the stake was a real witch. Let me tell you the story of THE WITCH'S CLOCK This is your last chance, Mrs. Farrell, are you still willing to relinquish the comfort and security of a modern Manhattan apartment for the... roughing wilds of Massachusetts? Think well before you answer. Well, I've been giving the matter due thought... I've decided that I must stay by the side of my unworthy husband. Where he goes, I go. Well said, Mrs. Farrell. Your husband must be a very lucky man. I'm a lucky girl. Oh, Bob, the furniture's marvellous! All antiques, the agent said. Doesn't the history of this old place seem to reach out and touch you? It seems though we stepped back in time two hundred years. It's only the dust and smell of age. In a couple of days we'll have the place all aired out. It'll be better than any apartment on the island could ever be. - Is there a dungeon? - Yes. Down there. Nothing in it though but some junk and more dust. Show me. I want to see. Come on, please. Very well, your wish is my command. You see, nothing but a bunch of 16th Century lumber and rags. Oh wait a minute, maybe some of the first Pilgrims used these things. - Maybe Miles Standish... - It's just junk, Julie. Oh, we might get a few bucks out of it in that town down the road. I suppose you're right. I know I'm right. I mean, this stuff isn't exactly Fifth Avenue quality after two centuries. - Wait a minute Bob...I've found something. - What is it? It looks like a grandfather clock. A peculiar old frame. I've never seen a clock like that before. I don't blame whoever owned it, hiding it away like that. It would go perfectly in the main room, dear. Please, it's really very pretty once you get used to it. All right Mrs. Farrell, you win again. One grandfather clock coming up. There. Oh, it's beautiful Bob, so stately and majestic. It was made for this corner. You're the interior decorator, I'm just the handyman. Come on, let's get this place cleaned up. - Bob, it's not working. - What do you expect after two hundred years? Please see if you can fix it. Oh, can't it wait? I mean, we got a lot to do and I'm getting hungry. All right. I guess it can wait. Doesn't seem to be any way to open it, Julie. I... I guess I'll have to break it open. - No, Bob! isn't there a key? - None that I can find. Whoever owned it sealed it up real tight, like they didn't want anyone to use it again. There must be one somewhere. - Here it is, Bob. - Oh. - Now are you satisfied? - Mmm-hmm. Needs only to get started.. There. - There's someone at the door. - Now who would be out on a night like this? That's quite a wind. I'm sorry to disturb you. My name's Tristram... Tristram Halbin. Oh, I'm Bob Farrell and this is my wife, Julie. Oh sir, I'm sorry. I thought the Mahlers lived here. - I've come a long way to see them. - You must have made a mistake. There hasn't been anyone living here for the last five years. We just bought the place and are moving in today. Oh. - Is something wrong? - No. I should have known the Mahlers would be gone by now. Well, thanks for the momentary shelter. You can't go out on a night like this, Mr. Halbin. Do you have a place to stay? No, I've just arrived. I thought the Mahlers would take me in. I used to know them quite well. I was going to work for them. My husband and I have plenty of room here. We'd be happy to put you up for the night. - Wouldn't we, Bob? - Oh yes. Certainly. And if you need work we certainly could use your help cleaning up this place. - In exchange for room and board, if that's all right? Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Do you have any baggage? - No, I travel light. And I'll bet you haven't even eaten. - It has been a long time. - I'll remedy that. - You have a good wife, Mr. Farrell. - Yes. And don't think she doesn't remind me of it! I haven't seen a room like this in a long time. I don't suppose this has changed in two hundred years. More like three hundred. Oh, won't you have a seat? Yes, but it's perfect for my work- the atmosphere here. Would it be rude to ask you what your work is? - No, not at all. I'm a writer. Mostly mysteries and the like. - I've been fairly successful lately, so Julie thought it would be a good idea for us to move into the country. You've made a good choice coming to Massachusetts. I had some coffee on the stove Mr. Halbin, and I made you a sandwich. - I hope that will be all right. - Yes. Very satisfactory. I'll show you your room later, and tomorrow you can start work. Thank you, you're kind. You're both very kind. - Good morning, Mr. Farrell, I presume. - Yes. I'm Dr. Finchley, your local physician. Good morning Dr. Finchley. Won't you come in? Well, thank you. That's very kind of you. I was just passing by and thought I'd drop in on the new addition to our community. That's very nice of you. My wife isn't at home right now, she's gone into town with our handyman. Oh? That's too bad. I was hoping to meet her. Yes. That's too bad. You're a writer I hear? I wanted to be a writer too, once, but I got sidetracked somewhere. Won't you have a seat? Yes. There's a lot to write about around here. Got a couple of story ideas myself. Like to tell you about them sometime. I'd like to hear them. Right now I'm doing a feature article for a major magazine on witchcraft in New England. Witchcraft, hey? There was a lot of it around here. Plenty of burnings. Oh my, yes. Plenty of burnings. Yes, well that's what I'm writing about. It was a regular witch court out there. Got rid of a lot of old bags. You didn't like your mother-in-law... spread the word she's a witch. Before you know it, poof! No more problem. Those were the good old days, some say. Well thank you, but I have work to do. Maybe you could come back another time. Oh, time to go. Got a busy schedule, you know. Nice talking to you, Mr. Farrell. I'll come back when I got more time. There's a lot to say about those graves down there, and about Lucy Mahler. She was the only real witch there ever was. Died 1673. Say hello to your wife for me. Until some other time then. - Wait a minute Dr. Finchley. - Yes? I'd like to hear more about Lucy Mahler and the graves. Most people won't talk about it, you know. She was a real witch all right. Town folk tried to get rid of her and her whole family. Buried them all right down in the crypt along with their friends. Then she was the one who lived here? That's right. Lucy Mahler had powers, not witch powers mind you, but magical powers. There's even talk that she enchanted a clock, but nobody's had the nerve to find out for sure. - Clock? - Yes. People say it could bring back the dead. Well, I've got to be going now. - Nice meeting you, Mr. Farrell. - Yes. Goodbye Dr. Finchley. Tristram Halbin...died 1673. Listen to me Julie. You cannot, you will not, stay with your husband. His cruel and sadistic nature is revolting to you. You want only to leave with me. Do you understand? You will tell your husband. - Tristram, I've been looking for you. You're just in time. - Your wife has something to tell you. - That can wait. I have something to tell you. Something I think you'll find very interesting. Lucy Mahler truly knew the power of time. Time and life are one. Yes, I know your secret, and I know why you were sent here, but you'll not succeed. I'll see to that! No! No! you don't know the curse. You'll kill us all! No! Did the agent say why that young couple left here, Hazel? They just left. That's all. Look, we got this place at a terrific bargain. So don't borrow trouble! - I was just wondering. - Don't! - You haven't the brain for it. - 'You haven't the brain for it'. Isn't that a beautiful clock? I just love clocks. - Oh, sorry to disturb you. I'm afraid you didn't hear my knock. I'm looking for the Mahler family. Many stories have been written about creatures of darkness and Brotherhoods of Evil. These tales have been influenced by European folklore, handed down through the ages and telling of creatures roaming in the woods at night, half man, half beast, preying on the townspeople. The simple people of a few generations ago, if they heard of a mutilated body found near their village would run home, gather their families to them and securely lock their door. Various things were used to exorcise these evil creatures such as holy symbols, certain herbs and true metals. We of more modern times with our better educations, communications, and police forces are inclined to scoff at things we do not understand. If a mutilated body were found today the police would quickly track down the killer by consideration, motivation, opportunity and means. We insist that such a deed must have been done by a human hand, not inhuman. All these old tales had these creatures of darkness to be a group-minded lot, slaves to the dark powers that possess them. However, as the average citizen became better able to protect himself and families, the number of these demonic creatures dwindled until only the most clever were able to survive. It was a case of keep your wits about you or perish. Here is a story of one such dark creature who kept up with the times. I call it KING VAMPIRE. She's the thirteenth. Puncture wounds on the neck and left to the rats. - And you have no idea who's behind it? - No. It could be anyone. We haven't a clue as to who, or where, or why. But there must be a pattern. No. Just killing girls. You know the newspapers have a name for him- 'King Vampire'. Look here. This is where the girl's body was found this morning. Over here, the one before. Here another one, and another. See, there's no pattern. Then we're obviously dealing with a madman. No, he would like us to think that but actually he's quite the opposite. Now even madmen commit their crimes in an obvious pattern of time and place. This murderer is worse than a madman. He's shockingly sane! He's the cruelest, most cunning criminal mind I've ever encountered. It's almost as if he knows every move before we do. All I can say is we better get cracking and catch this King Vampire fellow or we'll soon be out of our jobs. Yes, you don't know how right you are. You know, all London's been in turmoil about these murders. People are beginning to ask questions. They want to know what what we're going to do about it. The embarrassing thing is we don't know what we're going to do. You haven't been able to find a single clue at any of the scenes of the crime? None. The people in that area are thieves, gutter-scum- the lot of them! They'd just as soon see us dead than help us. Well, I don't suppose it would hurt to give it another try. Where was that last girl murdered? Oh, just outside Romsley Lane. But you take care, they're a rough lot. Romsley Lane. Right. Yes, I think I'll give it a go. I don't know what side to call him. We can't have these coppers here in the first place! - I don't think... - What's up? King Vampire got another one last night. The coppers are down here for it. We're not too fond of the way you're handling the situation. Yes, I can see that. We don't like strangers around here. Who are you? my name is John Brenner and I'm a detective. - I don't believe you. - Well, I've got papers to prove it, if you like. What good is papers to the likes of us? We can't read a letter. You're a trusting lot, aren't you?! Not when there's a vampire about. That's why I'm here. I've come to help. The law's no help to the likes of us. We don't need you. You need me more that you know. All right. Search all you like. You'll find nothing. King Vampire's clever that way. Well, thank you. Now tell me, who here has seen the face of the murderer? Who can tell me what he... what he looks like? I said, who can tell me what he looks like? Surely one of you has caught a fleeting glimpse of him? yeah, Governor, I've seen him. Speak up. What did you see? Well, the same as everyone else. He's a slight man all dressed in black. Like an undertaker he is with his his hat all pulled down over his face now. Oh, he's a terrible sight. That's for sure. Why didn't you tell this to the officer before? Well, I wouldn't be telling it now, but it was my sister he done in last night. I'm sorry. - Well, thank you very much. - Don't thank me. I wasn't doing it to help you. He was brave enough to step forward. Why are you afraid? Tell me, who has seen the face of the vampire? Who has seen King Vampire's face? You'll learn no more here, Mr. Brenner. they've no love for the law. But all I wanted to do was help them. Do they enjoy living in fear of the night? Would you be willing to find the vampire if you knew that your brother or your father or your sweetheart... No Mr. Brenner! They are not afraid of the vampire, they're afraid of themselves. But you don't appear to be frightened. Perhaps you can help me? Yes, I can help you. I've seen the man you're looking for. I only got a glance of his face as he ran past, but the look of it will never leave me eyes! Gruesome it was, with the look of death on it. I've seen many a dead one, sir, and all have had more life in the flesh than the vampire. But his features? They were hidden in the darkness, and the hat he wore. Look for a man with the face of a corpse and you'll find your vampire. - Thank you, Mrs....? - O'Shea. O'Shea...and I promise I'll do my best to rid London of this monster. Thank you again. - Goodbye. - Goodbye Mr. Brenner. I wish you luck. Luck is finally with us, Inspector. I have a description of the vampire. What? No, I can't believe it! Oh, just wait a moment. Miss Clark, would you please stop what you're doing there and be prepared to take dictation. - Yes, sir. - All right John, what have you learned? Take this down. First off, I discovered the people pf Romsley Lane to be quite hostile as to what we are doing. As you said, they're becoming restless... and potentially dangerous to themselves, but upon questioning, a kindly old woman, a Mrs. O'Shea, was brave enough to step forward and describe the murderer, and the description she gave was not a pleasant one, I dare say! He said he appeared to be rather... Why, it's Mrs. O'Shea! Like all the rest. How does this man know the one woman that might have been able to help? A fine lot of good you did in protecting her! How do you expect help from us when all we get in return is that?! Listen, she'd be alive right now if you fools would get out of your shells and go after this monster. We can't do it alone. We need your help. What are you waiting for, your wives and your daughters to be picked up off the street, your idolatrous fiend. You better make up your mind and make it up now. Can't you see, Inspector, they hate us more than King Vampire. Yeah, the wrong lady! We just needed time to catch the killer ourselves. What do you mean? I mean, we caught your vampire without any help from the police. What's going on? Who are you? It's judgement day, matey. What do you want with me? These people have heard very serious charges against you, want to know where you were last night. - Well, I was right here. - You're a liar! You were out killing old ladies, weren't you? Weren't you! We just want to know where you were last night. Nobody's going to hurt you but we must have the truth. I was right here. I take a walk through the park every night,. What do you think, Brenner? He does fit the description Mrs. O'Shea gave, - the meager body and the pale skin. - What makes you think he's King Vampire? - King Vampire! - Is this proof enough? Now do you believe he's the murderer you're after? I know it looks bad... but I killed a dog. A mad dog. Surely there's no crime in that? You're not only a murdering vampire, you're a snivelling coward! You killed poor Mrs. O'Shea and all the others. You drained their blood and left them here for us to find, and now you're going to pay for our crimes! Stop it! You can't take the law into your own hands! Well...now we'll never know if that was the man we were really after. Good morning, Inspector. How are things going? Oh, not very well I'm afraid. There's been three more murders since that man was beaten to death. Three more?! Yes. Remember he swore that he killed a dog? He was telling the truth. We just took a test on his blood. - Then who is King Vampire? - I only wish I knew. We've taken in every possible suspect that fits this description. Still no luck. King Vampire is a slippery as he is cunning. Say, I just got a funny idea. I'm really not in the mood for funny ideas, John. No, but suppose King Vampire isn't a king at all. You're not making sense. That's where we've been wrong. Well, everybody's been wrong. The vampire's not a man... he's a woman. That would account for the slight figure. Don't you see? I must admit I'd never given it a moment's thought. But... No, no, no. It's incredible. No woman could commit such heinous crimes. I suppose you're right. Just a funny idea of mine. Oh, by the way, I just dropped by to tell you I've been reassigned to another case. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, John. You've been a great help to me. I've appreciated it. Goodbye, good luck, and I hope we meet again under happier circumstances. Well, thank you, Inspector. I'm just sorry I can't stay around to help you catch King Vampire. I'm sure you'll be done with it shortly. And goodbye to you, Miss Clark. A woman? I wonder... No, no! It's too incredible. I agree, Inspector. It's simply too impossible. Yes, still I have a feeling we'll never know who did it now. History will probably record that King Vampire turned out to be a large, embarrassing question mark. Well, where were we, Miss Clark? 'Possible means of capturing the vampire'. In the days when zombies, werewolves and other monsters roamed wild, stalking their victims over the face of the earth, everyone was afraid of the unknown. They were called the 'un-dead'. A dedicated scientist, who some called mad wished to rid the earth of this evil curse. He was aware of the terrible danger, but he was willing to take the risk in order to understand the workings of these creatures. He hoped to work out a formula that would remove the curses placed upon them and permit their tormented souls to rest in piece. The people of the surrounding countryside heard weird screams... strange noises in the night... Open graves frightened them more. No-one would go to such places for any reason, but the scientist was not afraid, he was submerged in his work, but he began to lose the sense of value that they all had. He lost his original idea... swung round to a new one... Why not try to find the tiny spark of life that gives these long-dead creatures their energy? The brute force they could summon with it was awesome to behold. If one could isolate the spark... give it to a live human... it would give great strength, long life and good health. The problem was to isolate this motive power, apply it to a dead person, study it and give the results to the world. Let me tell you the story of THE MONSTER RAID. Can you hear me, master? It is I, Desmond. I have come for you. If you can hear me, knock three times. - Good old Desmond. I knew I could rely on you. Push hard on the lid, master. Push! Push! I have the coach waiting, master. Help me, Desmond. It is hard to control these decaying limbs and muscles. - How well I remember this road. - It is the way to my home. - I remember each turn, every rut, every jar of the coach. - Yes...home...and the waiting arms of my faithful, loving wife, Helen. - Yes, I can still picture her as she was, the day before - she and Doctor Sevard ended my life. The Doctor and Mrs. Spalding are waiting for you in the laboratory, Doctor Sevard. After years of experimenting I've finally broken the barrier. With this chemical and hypnosis, the mysteries of the cellular memories and the secrets of the human mind... James! How fortunate. You're just in time to hear Charles' latest theory. James, this is fantastic! I've been conducting certain experiments with chicks, using just the injection alone. Now I build a simulated barnyard. Now the chicks never saw their mothers. I made sure of this. Then with a piece of paper I cast a shadow over the barnyard. Turned one way and it casts the shadow of a circle. Now when the shadow of the circle was passed around it nothing happened. - well? - But... Turning it the other way it cast the shadow of a hawk. Upon seeing this the chicks immediately scurried for their coops. Amazing. What I really came for... I wanted to invite you to a party at my château. A very small and few intimate friends. You will come? Gee, I'm sorry James, I can't leave my experiments. Oh, but you could go though, Helen. The change would do you good. - Are you sure it'll be all right, dear? - Of course, darling. Look, you go and enjoy yourself. Well Charles, I'm sorry that you won't be coming. I was hoping to hear more details about your work, however, I'll stop by some other time. I'll send a carriage for you at eight, Helen. Wonderful, James. I'll see you out. - Darling... - Shh! Desmond might be within earshot. He's always lurking around, somewhere in the shadows. When I take you away from all this you'll no longer have to worry about Desmond...or Charles either. Charles will have his work... Desmond will have Charles... and we will have each other. Sometimes I wonder about your intentions, James. - Do you really love me? - What nonsense! Of course I love you, darling. Is something bothering you? I think you're just using me as a pawn to find out everything Charles knows. Of course what he knows is important, important to both of us. After all, I must be familiar with what will soon be ours. Yes. I must leave you now. I'll see you later tonight. Goodbye dear James, until tonight. - Yes, dear, loving Helen. - Little did I realise then that you and James planned to kill me. - I remember the day quite well... - Well enough for it to will me back from the grave! - Faster, Desmond! Faster! My love, my faithful love awaits my swift return. These notes are amazing, Charles. The medical council of Geneva is certain to recognise you at their next meeting. Perhaps, but the most complex of my experiments is yet to be tried. I was wondering, James would you consent to letting me try my theory out on you? Then we could together show our triumph to the board at Geneva. Will you do it? I'm a little hesitant about acting as a guinea pig for you Charles. After all, it would be an added factor if I could assist you. Couldn't we use someone else? - What about Desmond? - No! No, not Desmond. Someone else perhaps. I wish it were you. - I did not realise then why James didn't wish me to use my formula on him, - but I realised it soon afterwards, - to unlock his mind would be to unlock his secret... - His and Helen's secret! Oh yes, Desmond. What is it? Well, what is it? I'm very busy. - Sir, I don't know how to say this, but... - Come on, out with it, Desmond. What's bothering you? Well sir, I've been with you for many years, long before you brought her here as your wife. What are you trying to say and what does Helen have to do with this? Sir, she and Dr. Sevard are carrying on behind your back. Terrible it is, sir. Terrible! Helen...having an affair with James? Oh no, that's preposterous. It can't be. Mark my words, sir. I saw it with my own eyes. I suspected it for some time. All right, out with it...all of it! What do you know? Well, sir, I heard them talking. They were very lovey, talking about how they were going to do you in and take credit for your discovery. Desmond, you've been loyal to me for many years. I've suspected something for a long time. I just couldn't face it. Oh, Helen, dear, what are you doing here, I thought you hated the lab? I just thought I'd help you with your notes. I'll take care of that dear. I'll attend to it later. If you want to though you may tell James that I need him here right now. Are you ready to proceed, Charles? Who have you chosen for the subject for the experiment? You are going to use it on me, James. Oh... - Yes...I decided to have the experiment performed on myself. - I foolishly believed that it could do me no harm. - I was familiar with all the principles of my formula. - No-one could completely hypnotise me against my will. - I could only benefit by it, and my mind would be far superior after the injection. - Then I could decide how to deal with them. - I watched Dr. Sevard's every move... or so I thought. Well Charles, this is it. Are you ready? Ready. What a fool I was. He had secretly concentrated my formula to many times its normal strength. Is he dead? He looks like it. No, not yet, but to all appearances he is. I thought he'd be dead when this was over. He'll be dead when we bury him. Have Desmond handle the details. The sooner we bury him the better. At least no-one will doubt it. He's been working very hard. Oh James, now we can start life over, together. We'll really live, won't we, James? Oh, yes, darling. With the fame and recognition we'll get from these experiments, we'll be able to live in any manner we like. - Yes, they buried me. My faithful wife, dressed in black, her lack of tears hidden by a heavy veil, - and my poor friend, Dr. Sevard, who conveniently signed my death certificate, - standing by her side in deep sympathy. - They did not realise that the highly concentrated injection - of my formula had placed me in a state of suspended animation, and had - preserved my brain, heart and lungs long after the exterior of my body - had begun to rot and decay and yield to the elements. But faithful Desmond came for me, as I knew he would. - I wonder if dear Helen will recognise me! James has used me. Just as I told him long ago. I was so foolish to believe him. I see less of him than I did of Charles. At last master, we shall have our revenge. Please don't try to escape. Desmond has already set fire to all the exits. Helen darling, it's your loving husband, Charles. We'll be together forever. Medical knowledge is always been a fascinating subject. It took ages to learn each single mystery of the human body. Even now there are many secrets and it will take ages more before the last one is resolved. Perhaps it never will be, but many hope for steps forward. It turned out to be not at all what researchers wanted... Some were disastrous, some were greatly beneficial to mankind, but these were very few. In the great majority of experiments simply nothing was learned. The medical men keep trying, hoping to solve the riddle. Most of the knowledge that has come down to us has been gained by the thousands of hours of patient research by dedicated men and women. Some of the great discoveries have been quite by accident. Researchers weren't even looking for the results they found. Subjects to study have always been hard to come by. The fear of disturbing the human body after death is always present. Those who would learn have been forced to use what ever was available. Let us turn now to Scotland in the mid 1800s, when grave robbing was the common source of supply for the medical schools. We shall follow the lesson of the medical students as they discover THE SPARK OF LIFE. Come in. - Oh, Mr. Cushing. - Doctor. Mr. Sedgewick. I invited you here today because of your tremendous interest in yesterday's lecture. It seemed to me that you had further questions to present. If so, what are they? As I remember, doctor, you said that electricity was the primary force of life. Yes, I had a colleague at Hamburg University... He had elaborate theories about that. Can you tell us more about that? Well, all I know is he said he could bring the dead to life with electricity. - Did he succeed? - No, they threw him out. All his research papers were burned. - What was his name? - Baron Eric Von Frankenstein. - Where is he now, sir? - No-one knows. He gave up his practice and he just disappeared. But wait, I'll show you how Dr. Frankenstein started all his theories. Now watch closely. Apply a simple electrical stimulus to the forearm... The muscles contract and the hand closes. But my theory is, if you apply enough electrical stimulus over the entire body, for a certain length of time, it will rejuvenate the dead cells and muscles, and the dead will live again. Excuse me. Hello? Oh yes. Oh I'll be right along. Thank you. Goodbye. I'm sorry gentlemen, I must leave you, but you stay here and study. Ponder the question: life is electrical by nature, but is electricity life? Well, that was all pretty dull. 'Is electricity life'? Oh, really?! - Hey, I've got an idea. - What's that, Cushing? - A way to have some fun. - Let's hear it. Shall we bring him back to life? Say, that's a brilliant idea. - Why not? - Won't he be surprised? I should think so. - Sure, why don't we give it a try. - All right, but where can we work on him? Hey, how about the old lab in the back. Nobody uses it any more. We could go in there after classes. Nobody would see us. - Okay? - Onward! Oh, it's Dr. Mendell. Must be. Now look, you be quiet and let me do the talking. What are you gentlemen doing with that cadaver? We were just about to consult you on a new project, sir. A new project? Well, I'm always glad to hear that my students are trying to further their knowledge. We knew you would be, sir. Well, yes...? Well, the point is, we were so inspired by your last lecture that... Weren't we, Cedric? Oh yes, very inspiring, Dr. Mendell. We decided to do some research on our own. Well, that's wonderful. I'm always glad to hear that my students are taking a real interest in science, going to delve into its mysteries, try to unravel its secrets. Gentlemen, would you mind if I joined you in the process? - Oh, we'd be happy to have you, sir. - Why, thank you. Now exactly what is it? Well, we want to bring him back to life. What did you say?! How did you think of such a thing? We want to utilise your theory of electro-biological resuscitation. - All we want is an opportunity to test it. A chance to prove my theory. Gentlemen, I'm proud of you. I'm so pleased that I give you my whole-hearted endorsement. - Well, thank you, sir. - Thank you. Very good. Well, don't just stand there, there's lots to do right now. You don't stand in the way of research, you know. What's that, doctor? My equipment. I'll show you how it operates. - A rubber mat. - Yes, sir. - Prepare his arm. - Yes, sir. Thank you. Don't be too alarmed, boys. That was just an electrical charge to the muscles, but as I told you, my theory is with a sufficient electrical charge to the entire body the dead cells will be rejuvenated and life will be restored. You mean you think you can actually bring back the dead this way? That is my theory, if the body is undamaged at death. Well, excuse me gentlemen, lectures you know, but I'll return as soon a classes are over. He sure gave me a hell of a scare. Yeah, me too. I wonder if this is such a good idea. Oh, don't be silly. Sure it is. He couldn't possibly come back to life. I don't know. All I know is I'm beginning to yearn for those stale classroom lectures. This isn't quite as entertaining as I thought it would be. We can't back down now, we're in too deep. And whose bright idea was it to get Dr. Mendell mixed up in this anyway? Well, I didn't have much choice, did I? Anyway, after old Mendell makes a fool out of himself trying to bring this body back to life, we'll all have a big laugh and call the whole thing off, and no-one will be the wiser. Okay? Okay. He isn't really going to do it, is he? I mean...you know... fooling around with a corpse this way. What if the police find out? Oh be quiet. They don't have to find out anything. Nothing's going to happen. Stand by that switch. You assist me, please. Yes, sir. Now watch closely. Power. I need more power. Give me more amps, please. - What the dev... - Fools! Patience, patience I said! Well, gentlemen, I guess it isn't going to work. I guess my theory wasn't feasible. I guess...it wasn't meant by the Fates for me to succeed. But I was so sure it could be done. Well, cheer up doctor, you tested your theory and it just didn't work, that's all. Hold him! I'll get a needle. Hold him! Hold him! Hold him! My theory, it's a success! I'm a genius! You know it, I'm a genius! You can't possibly be alive. But..I...am... As you can see... Thank you for returning me to the realm of the living. Tell me, what's your name? Amos Duncan...at your service, gentlemen. Amos Duncan... You were executed for murder, weren't you? - That's correct. - You killed eight people with a knife... Correct again...but I was caught and executed... but now I shall have my revenge. We can see...now excuse us for a moment... Dr. Mendell... Now listen, this guy is dangerous. We can't have him leaving here. - How would we explain it? - Yes, and the police. - What will happen to us? - Oh but my career...I'll be ruined! - We can't say that we brought him back to life as a laboratory experiment! Well, no, of course not. It's too fantastic! Right. We've got to get rid of him. You can't mean what I think you mean? Oh no, you couldn't do that! That'd be murder! Why would it? We gave him life we just take it back again, that's all. No, no, I won't have anything to do with it. I agree with Dr. Mendell, we just can't kill it. Be realistic! He's just an experiment. Nothing more. This way...no-one will ever know. Well...I guess you're right... - He has to go. Yeah, I guess so. Good, then it's settled. He mustn't leave this room alive. But who's going to do it? Who ever the knife points to. - Agreed? - Agreed. Oh no, I won't do it. I just can't do it. I tell you... Either you do it or you'll ruin all our lives. Your career won't be worth a plumb nickel if he escapes. All right...I'll do it. Good... Now I know you want to be left alone. - Yes. - Get it over with as quickly as you can. - Remember, it's all for the better. Come on Finch. What was...that... - all about? - You wouldn't understand, Amos. I hate to do this, Amos, but there's no alternative. - It must be done. - What...must... ...be done? - What do you have there? - I'm sorry old man. Sorry, sorry, sorry... He's dead all right. Dead as a door nail. Looks like old Mendell came through for us. We owe him a lot. He sure got us out of a tight spot. Yes sir. I don't mind telling you I was pretty scared. Just knowing he isn't up and around is a big load off my mind. Well, shall we take one last look at Amos Duncan, deceased? All right. - My god, it's Dr. Mendell. - Where's Amos Duncan? In the mists and shadows of old folk tales, one story stands out above all others... It concerns frightened people huddled about their fires, not daring to venture forth after dark, cowering in fear of the vampire, a horrible creature that feasted upon the blood of living humans. These unfortunate beings were doomed by the mark of the vampire to roam eternally and spread the evil ever wider... The only way to stop them is to track each one, to his coffin lair where he must remain during the light of day and to drive a stake through his heart. Once freed in this manner, they were able to rest in peace. There were hundreds of such creatures roaming about, each with a new malady and a strange power, such as ghouls, werewolves, witches and warlocks, gnomes, trolls, cabals, etc... Hundreds of them teem through these old tales. The list of such creatures is a very long one. If a person had to go out at night he had to be a very brave person, or a very foolish one. Who could know what might just pop out from around a corner, what horrible creature might spring at one out of the shadows? I shall part the mists... lighten the shadows... and tell you the story of COUNT ALUCARD. - Count Alucard's castle, Herr Harker. - Good. Let us make haste. I wish to arrive there before nightfall. I'm afraid I cannot fulfill your request with such eagerness, Herr Harker. This is as far as I go. Driver, you were paid to take me to the castle, not half way. I must insist you do so at once. With all due respect, perhaps if you understood the situation. Situation? What situation? The shroud of darkness that surrounds the Count's castle is no illusion. - It's the cloak of the 'un-dead'. - Nonsense. No Herr Harker, I speak the truth. The castle itself is evil, a living evil. None in my village will go near the castle. I have no time for your local superstitions. - However, you seem serious. - I am. You're a stranger here. If I had time I would offer you a rational explanation that I'm sure would satisfy you, however, since you refuse to take me further, I'll proceed alone. If you must go, a word of warning: when the clock strikes midnight, one doesn't dare go out. - Welcome Mr. Harker, I trust you had a pleasant journey. - I know the roads can be unpleasant this time of year. Winter has been very hard. I know that your journey has probably left you with a great hunger so I've had a dinner prepared for you. If you would, please, follow me. - You're not dining, Count? - Please, don't concern yourself. I have already dined. Well, Carfax Abbey is excellent, Mr. Harker. Twenty acres, secluded, high stone walls, and just on the outskirts of London. - Exactly what I needed. - Wonderful. Perhaps we can sign the papers in the morning. Not during the day, I'm afraid. I can see you sometime in the evening. I suffer from an ancestral malady. A nervous condition. I sleep during the day and I'm awake only at night. Your family, are they originally from Transylvania? No. My family came with the conquering hordes of Attila the Hun. They built an empire lasting many centuries around here until the Turks battered at our borders. What a terrible sight, those fierce battles. So many of my kinsmen spilling their blood into the soil. Much blood was lost to the invader. Precious blood. A debt that is not yet collected in full. You speak almost as if you were there yourself, over three hundred years ago. You must forgive me, Mr. Harker, my family bloodline means a great deal to me. (WOLF HOWLS) Listen... - Think what a savage thrill it must be to be a... hunting creature. It is late. Perhaps we should proceed with the papers? Of course. Count, you are now the new master of Carfax Abbey. Yes...but the hour grows late and you must be weary. Your bedroom is this way, Mr. Harker. This is your room, Mr. Harker. My apologies, but will will have to amuse yourself during the day tomorrow. I shall join you sometime after sundown. Goodnight, Count. Who are you and what are you doing here? My name is Medina, I'm from far away from here. All that really matters is that I am here, with you for now. Were you sent to me? No, I came because I saw you, my Roger. - I must leave you. - Medina, wait. We shall meet again. Medina! Count, the girl, did you see her? You've cut yourself, Mr. Harker. There's blood on your throat. Yes, blood. What's the matter with you Count, have you gone mad? What brings you here at this time of night? Thank heavens you're all right Count. A child was attacked in the village tonight. - Why do you come here? - I followed the attacker here. A woman dressed in white. A woman? A woman dressed in white! The un-dead, they say in the village, and I'm inclined to agree with them. The work of a vampire. - Vampire? - Yes. We must hurry. Join us and bring a torch. I'll be more than happy to. Perhaps we should wait for the men? No, we must go quickly, before she returns to her grave. - What was that? - It was that way! It came from the direction of the crypt. Come on! Good lord, it's Hans. He's dead. Puncture marks on his neck. The body's still warm. You men out there, stay together. Don't search alone, and what ever you do, don't let those torches go out! It's already cost the life of one man. Over here. Split up in two groups. Keep searching. We're going on ahead. Look there Burgermeister, the cobwebs around the crypt are broken. Wait here Harker. There's movement within the crypt. - Bats. - Vampire bats! - We have come prepared, but how? - How? I've heard stories of the undead, of vampires... My loved ones were killed by a menace such as this. This is my revenge. Quickly now, the other one. - It's empty. - Yes. We'll wait for her in the shadows. She must return before sunrise. Medina- you, a vampire! Jon, my darling, the sun is down. We can be always together. Stranger, you have done a great service to our village. No longer will we be cursed by the un-dead. Were you of any assistance to the Burgermeister? I was. We dispatched the vampires. Well, now the villagers can live in peace without fear of the night. - Not quite. - Oh, how can that be? There's still the vampire that created the two girls. He also must be dispatched. That may prove a very difficult task. Vampires are hard to find, very elusive. I won't have to look for him. I know who he is. Mr. Harker, you are much too clever for your own good, and now for your meddling, you shall have to pay. I won't let you drain this village of its blood. I need it for myself! Ah! A werewolf! Subtitles 2021 Chattery Grymsteed
