KIM Hey. Calling to check in. How are you? - Um... well, I hooked up with Christine last night, and empty bed in the morning. - You know you deserve better than this, right? You know how much she hurt you. - Yeah, I don't know. Maybe... Maybe something imperfect beats being alone. I'm not exactly flawless myself. What is that supposed to mean? - Um, there's not a lot of buyers for damaged goods. - Cut that shit out right now, alright? Are you still doing your memory exercises every day? You know, just because your mom's decline came on fast doesn't mean the same is gonna happen to you, right? - Yeah. I know, I know. - Hey, you throw it back. - You sound sad. - Mommy, she won't give me my ball. - And you sound busy. I should let you go. Oh, okay. I gotta go. Love you. - I love you.

Um, could I get two glasses of Tempranillo, please? - Mm-hmm. - One's for me, and then one's for her. - Alright, you got it. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hmm. So do you do this a lot? - Do what? - I don't know, pick up sad and confused women in the farthest reaches of Little Haiti? - Only ones as gorgeous and interesting as you. - Oh. Well that is... It's very sweet of you. But you don't even know me. I don't know you yet. But I want to. Should we go somewhere else? For your own personal safety. And then you can disappear. Hey, hey. Are you okay? - Um, sorry. Yeah, I-I just, I've got a lot of... some things going on. - What do you mean? Like what? Okay, look, I know what you're thinking. You're like, "What is this white girl doing in Little Haiti, asking me all these personal questions?" - You know, that thought had actually crossed my mind, yeah. I just... I just wanna get to know you. That's it. - Um... Okay. Well, I've been getting these blackouts... occasionally, and I'm starting to think that they're becoming a little bit more frequent. And then when they come, I just lose all sense of place and time, and, uh, yeah, when I come to, I just... I'm left with this really strange sense of deja vu. It might be hereditary. My mom had dementia, so, yeah. Well, you know, I'm just, I'm just taking all the steps I can just to try and manage it till we can find out some more. - Hey. Thanks for telling me. - Hey. Should we go somewhere else? - Look, this has been a really nice surprise, but I do kind of have a work thing, and... Okay. I just, I-I do have to tell you something. - It is very, very bad luck to open a bottle of wine and not finish it. And I'm just only telling you this for your own personal safety. Really? ALEX: Mm-hmm. - Well, I'm already feeling pretty lucky, so... Okay, if I make it through the night, will you call me tomorrow? Mm-hmm. See you next time. Okay. And now what you've all been waiting for. So, uh, Melissa? The self-portrait of Haitian artist, Rose Porter. I know, I know. - Anyway, that's enough of me. Thank you so much. Um, eat and drink things and, uh, look at some art. Thank you. - Thank you. Look at things. Chris. Well, that was a really great speech. - Bullshit. You barely caught the end of it. But it was incredible, thank you so much. - Yeah? - Sucks to be you, yep. - Um, so, you know, I've decided that I think schmoozing British people might be my favorite part of this show. - Okay, yeah, but remember, we... - Do it for the culture. - Thank you. Alright. Come on, go be cute. Sell some paintings. Hey, I'll see you at the after-party? Yeah, I'll be there. Hey, stop. - Hi. Hi. CHRISTINE: Hmm. Hey, what's this? Um... I don't remember. I know. It's... It's a real shocker, right? Chris? Mm-hmm? - I thought we weren't doing this anymore. - Why wouldn't we wanna have fun anymore? We talked about this. - Billie? Hey. Hey, you okay?

Yeah, never trust the Internet. - Yeah, that is what I'm starting to think. Mm-hmm. - It's so much better to meet someone in person. Mm, this is not what I had before. - It's a reserve Tempranillo. I hope you like it. - Well, thank you. But I do have to get going. - It's just one drink, and then you can disappear on me. Hmm? - I guess one more won't kill me. - Hey.

It was such an honor to present your work. - Thank you so much. That's very sweet of you to say. Uh, but actually, I have to be going now, so, um, thank-thank you again. Nice meeting you. - Um, wait, is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Can we, um... The blackouts, the headaches, they're only getting worse, right? - You know about my...

Like, I know we just met, but I feel like I know you. - Maybe we knew each other in a past life. Oh. Okay. I like that. I think that means that we can skip past all of this bullshit small talk and just get straight to the good stuff. Hmm. - I'm sorry, this is... Is this too much? - No, - It's just like, we just met and I'm already unpacking all of my baggage. It's... - No, no, it's good. I like it. - Really? - Yes, I wanna know you. - Good. Okay. Well, in that case, it's your turn to overshare. Oof, okay. What do you wanna know? - Ooh, I know. What was your childhood like? - My childhood was... complicated. Um... My parents wanted me to be perfect. Like, if I didn't get straight A's, I didn't get dinner, or if my room was messy, my parents would lock me in my room until it was spotless. - Damn, I'm so sorry that your parents wouldn't let you mess up. - You know what? I happen to think that messy is pretty sexy. Shit. Um... This has been really, really incredible, but I'm-I'm late for this thing, and it's pretty important. I'm sorry. - Yeah, that's fine. See you next time. - Wait, do you wanna come to this work party with me? Like, I don't know if you like art at all, but if you do, I can promise you're gonna see some really stunning pieces. Oh, God. Impromptu plus-one invite's too much, right? - No. Yes, I wanna come. I wanna come. I didn't think you were gonna ask me. - Okay. Great. Um, hey, can we get the check? These are all by Rose Porter. I really love her work. She splits her time between Little Haiti and Haiti. - Oh, wow. - It's great perspective, I think. - It's beautiful. - Hey. Hey. - Hi. - Um, have you heard from Christine today? - No. Why? - She didn't show up tonight. I've been calling and texting, and no response. - That's really strange. She's never missed an opening. - Yeah, well, if you talk to her, let her know she owes me a round. - Yeah, sure. - That was intense. Hey. You okay? - Yeah, it's just someone MIA who's usually pretty responsible, so it's strange. - It's gonna be fine. - Yeah, sorry. - Show me around. - Um, yes, I would absolutely love to show you around. - So... you put all of this together yourself? - Well, it's a team effort. - I'm more or less the curator role. - Mm-hmm. - So I'm the one who goes out into the community. - Mm-hmm. - And I find rising talent. Believe it or not, the fine art world can be a pretty exclusionary. - Hmm. - Surprise, surprise, so... You know, we're just really trying to pull up some more seats at the table. - It's amazing. I mean, you're amazing. Come here. Wow. Isn't it beautiful? Hmm. It's really something. - I should go find the artist. Do you wanna meet her? - No. I wanna go home. Make yourself at home. Wow.

It's so embarrassing. - Do you have a problem with Kim? - Why would I have a problem with Kim? I don't even know Kim. - I know, but it's just... You know, I've been trying to get you to meet her, and you always seem to have some kind of an attitude around it. - Sorry, you think I have an attitude around it? - A little. Around what? Around my girlfriend going out and getting fucking wasted with another woman, acting like a fucking... - Sweetie? Sweetie? Hey. Um... Sorry. I had another... moment. - It's okay, sweetie.

I'll be right back. - Okay. See, I told you. Billie! Hey, Jakey. Ooh. Oh. Aw, you're okay. You got chocolate all over your hand. What happened? - Sorry, he just...

Huh. - And also, you know, I'm just, I'm kinda looking out for her, so... Looking out for her how? - Well, you know, I think she's been having a really hard time at work, and, you know, she's really worried about you and Jake. I think the stress is making her memory a little bit worse, so I'm just trying to help her decompress. - Wait, worried about us how? - Uh... Well, she said you guys are having some money trouble. - Oh, uh, that's, uh... We're fine. - Honestly, she-she did mention that she was thinking maybe it'd be a good idea to slow down your girls' nights a little bit, maybe so you can save some money. - She didn't mention that to me. Yeah, I think she's a little afraid of hurting your feelings. Hey. - Listen, if you need anything at all, please feel free to ask, okay? - You know, it's really nice to meet you, Alex, but, uh, excuse me, I-I better get back to Jake. Okay. BILLIE: High five? Yeah. Down low? Ooh. I love you. I'll take it from here. - Oh, are you sure? Yep. - Okay. - Is he gonna live? - Sure. - You good? - Yeah, it's... What did you two talk about? - Uh... Actually, she said something really weird to me. - Oh, really? Weird how? - Well, you know, she said she was worried that you were getting a little more forgetful and... And then she said she was worried about leaving you alone with Jake. - What? ALEX; And then she said something about an aide, which I said was completely unnecessary. - An aide? Why would she say that? That's-that's crazy. - I don't know, I think maybe she just had a lot of wine or something. I think she's just trying to help, sweetheart. - Yeah. Um, do you wanna... Should we go and get some cake? - Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. - Let's go. - Okay. I used to come here all the time with my mom. Really? BILLIE: Yep. Okay, you get us some grownup drinks.

We're definitely seeing an acceleration of memory loss, and the odds are that your case is in line with your maternal history. However, none of your tests have given us conclusive results.

But what if I could fix it? What if I could give you the perfect life that you always wanted? Wouldn't you want that? Perfection? ALEX: Yeah. - No. No, actually, I really wouldn't want that. That's not... For me, the tough stuff, that is what makes a relationship real. You know, sometimes I actually just wish that we would fight more. - You want me to fight with you? To what? To prove that I love you? - No, I want you to show me who you are. Like, the real you. - This is who I really am. - Sometimes it feels like you're holding back. - I'm just trying to make things better for you.

What, right now? - Yeah. - Okay. No, that's cool.

I'll call you in a bit, okay? - Okay. - Um, hi, can I check out please? Billie Jackson. Yes, of course. Here you go. - Do you wanna talk about it? I can give you a ride, we can grab a bite. - What were you talking about earlier, when you mentioned Alex? - Hey, you've had a long day. Sure we wanna go down that road? - Thank you. Kim, don't talk to me like a fucking child. Talk to me like an adult. - Okay, fine. I don't like that you're telling Alex my business. - What? She's my partner. Of course I'm gonna fucking talk to her about you. - About how poor we are? - What? Listen, I-I just don't like that you and your rich girlfriend are sitting there pitying me. - Oh, my God, what are you even talking about? - She told me what you said about not wanting to hang out to save money. - I never said that. Yeah, well, maybe you just don't remember. - Billie, I didn't mean... Billie? Billie, I didn't mean that. - Hey, baby. Um, where are you? - Uh... I'm just at work. Why, what's up? - I just... I feel like I'm losing my mind. Baby, it's gonna be okay, I promise. No, it's... It's not. It's not just my memory. It's, like, I just feel like everything is crumbling around me, and... I just, I feel so alone. Sweetie, I'm here for you. I swear I'm gonna take care of you. I just really think that everything would be a lot better if we just got our own place. - What? Alex, I'm not even calling you about that. I don't like this pressure that you're putting on me. I just think I can really help you through this transition, sweetheart. - Alex, I don't need a nurse. I'm-I'm not suggesting that. I just think that you need someone who loves you, who can take care of you. - I need some time to think, okay? This is my shit, and I don't wanna drag you into it. - Okay, well, I just hope you figure it out before it's too late. What is that supposed to mean? - I just mean that, in your condition, who is gonna love you? You know, I just... This is what girlfriends do. The tough stuff, you know? - Yeah. Yeah, you're right, you're right. Um... Let me sleep on everything, okay? I think I just... I just need some time to think. But promise I'll be okay. I love you. - Miss Porter? - Rose? - Rose? Hey, it's-it's Billie from the gallery. Um, your door was open. I just wanted to make sure that you're okay. - Rose? Oh, my God. Please. To remember. Have you heard from Christine? She didn't show up tonight. Hey. ALEX: Hi. Sorry, I was just worried. I hadn't heard from you, so I just wanted to make sure you were okay. - Yeah, no, I'm-I'm doing a lot better now. - Yeah? Are you sure? - Yeah. Um, you know what? Actually, I-I had a question for you. Oh, yeah? What's that? - Do you know an artist named Rose Porter? - Wait, she's a photographer, right? Yeah, one of our artists. We were at her show the night we met. - Yeah, no, I think, uh... Yeah, I think we shot together maybe once or twice back when I was still modeling. Why? - She killed herself today. - Oh, that's terrible. - Yeah. - Oh, sweetheart, you know, she's an artist. They're so unpredictable. - Alex, she didn't change her fucking hair color. She's dead. Did you know her? - I-I just said, "I think we shot together once or twice." - Mm, sure. - What does that mean? - It means that I think that you knew Rose Porter better than you're saying, and I don't understand why you're not being honest about it. - What makes you think that? - There are pictures of you on the Internet, Alex. - Yes, because I was in her show, I went to it. - There's photos of you two together. What happened between you and Rose? - Look, I just... I didn't wanna make it weird. I didn't want you to get mad. - Well, now I'm fucking mad. Just tell me, who was she? - She was my ex. - And? - And what? And nothing. We dated, we broke up. Look, she was in therapy, and then she wasn't in therapy. I... I don't know, she probably went off her meds or something if she slit her wrists. She was always threatening to hurt herself. It was hard. - What? What did you just say? - Which part? - About s... slitting her wrists. I never... I never said that. - Yes, you did. You just said that. - No, Alex, I didn't. - Billie... - between the two of us, which one of us do you think has the better memory? - Oh, fuck you, Alex. - Don't you ever talk to me like that, ever. You have no idea what I do for you. I swear to God, sometimes I wish you could remember. - Get the fuck outta my apartment, Alex, now. Now, get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. - Okay. Whatever you want. See you next time. Fuck! Fuck, fuck! Fuck! Wait, what are you doing? Why are you recording this? - So that this time, we can remember. - Remember what? - The truth. Okay, okay, can someone just tell me what the fuck is going on? - Have you been having weird dreams, flashes of memories that feel so real, but you-you-you can't remember having them? - Um... - They happened. Alex has been erasing them, resetting the days over and over and over. What? Have you ever loved someone so much you'd do anything to keep them? - Is that, is that what this is about? Are-are you still in love with Alex or... - Alex left me. I was alone, and desperate to get her back. I had so much heartache and disappointment that I fell into a dark place, which led me to the crystal. This crystal has the power to reset any moment in a person's lifetime. - Alright, this is really crazy. - Okay, the cuts on your body that you can't explain, your blood is fueling the crystal, and her obsession is making it worse. - Why are you telling me all of this? - Because I started this, and I need to fix it. When Alex figured out the power in the crystal, she almost killed me to take it. The crystal changes you. I did things that I'm not proud of. I hurt people. And so, I know that she'll do anything to keep you. Say that I believe any of this, which I don't, what can I do to stop her from just resetting everything again? - He said that he tried to help you, but you ran away. He's been trying to watch over you. "Sonje," it means "remember." - I mean, I didn't understand, I didn't know. - When Alex stole the crystal, I came to Papa Juste. He's been helping me ever since. He says I brought in a curse. That energy is not Haitian. It's blood magic. - Anything you put in this box will be protected from the reversal of the crystal. I began writing myself notes every day with the dates on them. And when the dates started repeating, I knew she started. I tried following Alex, but she warned me that if I kept interfering in her life, she'd kill me. You should be writing this down and putting it in the box in case she's resetting it as we speak. You have to hurry, Billie. Your brain can't take much more. Too many time loops will kill you. WHISPERING VOICE Billie. Billie. Well, that was really fun. It was so fun. Yeah. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I love you. - Love you. My place tonight? - Yeah. - Okay. - Get home safe. Bye. Bye. BILLIE: Bye. What? Billie? Ugh, you little shit. Goddammit. Jesus fucking Christ. Fucking wasted with someone else. You just ruined our entire night. Acting like a fucking whore! - I need you to get that crystal. And when you do, please reset time back to before I met Alex. After that, give the crystal to Papa Juste. Just don't keep it. You cannot control its power. Billie, you are the only person that can end this. Do you understand? Practice the spell. You'll need to know the magic in order for it to work. - So there's somewhere I've been thinking about taking you to. My parents have this great house out by the shore. I thought it might be nice for us to get away, just the two of us. Mm-hmm. You had this the whole time? It's really not that big of a deal. - What else have you been keeping from me? - Mm. Whoa. - This is your parents' place? Yeah, one of 'em. - Are they joining us this weekend? Not unless the weather changes in Ibiza. Oh, okay. - You wanna go swimming? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay, well, you can get changed in there if you want. - Okay. - I'm gonna check the pool. - Okay. - You can do this. Okay. Fuck! Come on. Babe. - Hey. I cut up some fruit. Ooh, that's nice. Mm. Where's the wine? What do you mean? - I don't know, a place this nice must have an amazing collection. I mean, they do, but why don't you get in? I mean, let's swim now, and then we can get shit-faced later, if that's what you wanna do. - Aw, come on. I thought we were on vacation, no? - We are. Babe, I thought you said you were gonna take care of me. - I am. - Please? Really? Mm-hmm. - Fine. Whatever you want. - Hey. I love you. I love you. Be right back. You know what, Alex? I'm done. I'm fucking done with this. - Fuck you. Nobody'll love you. Nobody else is gonna put up with this fucking bullshit. You wanna make this official? Move in with me. I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. - I do everything. - Alex, it's over. - You're gonna end up alone. Alex, you fucking broke us. Don't touch me! Break up with me if you want to, but I'll see you soon. I can't do this anymore, I'm done! - Fucking whore. Get the fuck away from me, you fucking bitch! You fucking broke us. It's over! - See you in a minute. Billie. I found one. It's your favorite. Baby? - You did it again. Fuck. Well... You know, I guess I had to know. You don't even know how to use that thing. Do you even know who you are right now? Jesus Christ. I mean, what would you even do without me, honey? You proposed to me here once, you know? We were so happy. Oh, God, but it was closer to eight months. I've been rushing. I keep trying to speed things up. It's just like I'm so fucking tired, Billie. How did you figure it out this time? Hey. You're blacked out. It doesn't matter. I'll figure it out eventually. Fuck. - Rose. Ro... Rose, I... I know, I know. - Hmm? - Rose, I know, I know what you did. - Oh, my God, come on. - Christine. - I did that to protect us. They don't mean anything. - What did you... What did you do to Christine? What did I do? You cheated on me with her. - No. - Yes. - No, I... You did. - I would, I would never do... Yeah. And it turns out your weakness is just specifically for her. So I didn't really have a choice. Uh, it was the easiest thing, was just to remove her from the equation. - No, you didn't. - I do have to admit, I think killing that bitch might be the only thing that I really enjoyed about all this. Why? Why would you do all of this? Why? - Because we're meant to be together. - Every time you leave me, you tell me that we're not right for each other. And you're wrong. - This isn't you. Alex, please. - I'm just trying to fix the things that aren't perfect. I just wanna make you happy. It was never my mom's dementia. My memory loss, - that's-that's your fault. - I know. I know. - That's you. - Sweetie, we only have to do this a few more times. We're so close. We're so close. It's almost done. You're gonna be so happy. - It's not real, Alex, none of this. This isn't real. Please. - Okay, stop it. I'm gonna need you to give that back now. This is taking too long. Come on. - And what if I don't? - I-I just, I don't think you really wanna go there. - Go where? You said that you would never hurt me, and I believe you, 'cause I don't think you could if you love me. - Sweetheart. Oh, honey. Love is the tough stuff. Do you have any idea how many times I have had to kill you? - Alex, it's over. - It was so hard. Oh, God. But it's all in the past now, honey. This time it's gonna be perfect. Everything is gonna be perfect. It's gonna be perfect this time. You just gotta trust me. Do you trust me? - Do you trust me? Do you trust me? - Yeah. - Okay. Give it to me now. Yeah. - Yeah. You did the right thing. - God-fucking-dammit. What the fuck did I tell you? I told you, you have to fucking trust me. You don't fucking listen, that's the problem. This is why we have to do this over and fucking over. - Baby, I know you don't mean it, but you can't do this, okay? We're almost there. All you have to do is trust me. That's why we have to do this so many times. I... I know you don't mean it, it's okay, but you can't do this. I'm sorry. ALEX: It's okay. We're gonna get it right next time, okay? It's okay. - I'm sorry. - I know you are. - No! - No, no, stop. Give it to me. Baby, please, please, stop. I love you. I love you. Please. No. Give me the crystal. Stop. No, no, please. - Shh. It's okay. It's over. Reset time back to before I met Alex. After that, give the crystal to Papa Juste. Just don't keep it. You cannot control its power.

Hey. Didn't expect to hear from you. I thought you had the opening tonight. I do. Heading there now. You bringing a date? Or will that be super awkward with Christine there? It'll be fine. I'm actually really glad to see her, but I will keep my distance. - I know, I know. I just, I would make sure I pick up one of her pieces before she's selling out exhibitions at the MoMA, that's all. - Anyway, that's enough from me. Um, eat things and drink and have a look at some art. Enjoy yourselves. - Thank you. - Hi. - Great speech. - Thank you. That is a great dress. New look? You know, things change. - Not everything. - But definitely this. We're done, Christine, and I mean it. Don't worry. I've moved on from all of that. Great, 'cause I've got someone perfect for you. Oh. Well, thank you, but I'm good. Wait, are you seeing someone? No, nothing serious. I'm just keeping my options open. Alright, girl. Just be careful out there.
