(wine splashing) (glasses clinking) (wind blowing) (birds chirping) Hill, goddammit, do you copy? [Hill] Yeah, I copy. Go ahead. Hey, there's a silver car out here. Been here a few days. I gave it a ticket, I don't know, two or three days ago. [Hill] No? Hey, you know, give me a read on 869663H. [Hill] Yeah, I'm not finding anything. All right, you know what? I'm gonna go look for the driver. [Hill] 10-4, Sandman. Roger that. (leaves rustling) (gentle music) Hello?! Hello? Hello? Ma'am? You know you're not supposed to be here. (ominous music) Ma'am? Ma'am. Are you okay? (body thuds) (Meyers retching) (dramatic music) And welcome back to KWLF. I'm David Walker. Following up on our breaking news, Senator Morrison's suicide comes on the heels of a scathing report by New York Times journalist Nora Thompson. The report details Morrison's involvement with a drug trafficking ring and the funneling of profits through the Morrison family charity, Hearts of Children. Now all of the Morrison family assets have been frozen. And, so far, there has been no comment from Senator Morrison's immediate family. Please join us tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. for an hour long report on the rise and fall of Senator Morrison. We have uncovered more details on Senator Morrison's illegal activity and a special report and interview with Nora Thompson herself, the New York times journalist who exposed Senator Morrison. Coming up next, what is a social media influencer? Do they matter? And how can you become one? We'll be right back after these messages from our sponsor. You're watching KWLF. I'm David Walker. (wall thudding) (tense music) (upbeat music) (gentle music) (gun fires) (bottle breaks) (gun fires) (bottle breaks) (gun fires) (bottle breaks) (gun fires) (bottle breaks) (gun firing) (bottles breaking) (Nora chuckles) It's about time. Been trying to get a hold of you all day. [Agent] I didn't know. I'm sorry. I had a family emergency. And I did call earlier, though. Did you? I didn't notice. Is your family, okay? [Agent] Yeah, everything's fine. Good because I wouldn't want to take up too much of your time if you're a preoccupied. I need someone who makes me their priority. [Agent] Hey, you are my priority. 100%. How are you? Fine. Just getting ready for tomorrow. Nothing I won't be able to handle. Between me and you, Clay Auburn is an idiot. I don't know who would give him an anchor seat. We used to go to school together. [Agent] It's good that you know him, though. It'll lead to friendly banter. Audiences love that. Oh, that reminds me. Don't bring up the senator's suicide. Well, duh, obviously. I'm not an idiot. [Agent] If Clay does, just send your condolences. Move on as quickly as possible. I'm not gonna give my condolences. If you ask me, suicide was too easy for that bastard. And his family knew what he was doing the entire time. They don't deserve well wishes or condolences. - Nora. - I'm a professional. If it comes up, I'll play it up. Hell, I'll even get teary-eyed if the mood calls for it. (mellow music) (Nora sighs) Stunning. Everything we deserve, finally. (Nora chuckles) Mm. Ew. Hashtag rest day. Hashtag journalist. Hashtag New York Times. Perfect. (Nora chuckles) (Nora sighs) This is the life. Hello, world! Oh, my god. We reached 1 million followers. (Nora chuckles) (Nora sighs) Nora Thompson, you are finally verified. My god, it's hard to get verified than it is to bribe a congressman. Yes. You earned your a fancy wine, girl. (Nora chuckles) Woo! (Nora chuckles) Any news on the Pulitzer board? [Agent] You're definitely one of the front runners. I don't want to be a front runner. I want to win. So make it happen. [Agent] Yes. Yeah, I will, don't worry. Good. I also liked your book idea. I think we should move forward with it. [Agent] Oh. Oh, perfect. Perfect, I can get started on that tomorrow. (shower running) I don't need to know the details. Now, look, I have to go. I want to finish prepping for tomorrow and I want to look fresh for the cameras. [Agent] It sounds really good. Hey, you know, I had some... Why, yes, Clay, it is unfortunate. Of course... Of course my thoughts and prayers go out to his family. Remember, viewers, suicide is not the answer, and there is help available to those who are struggling. That's it. That's the one. Cheers to you, bitch. (crickets chirping) Happy to be here, Clay. Thanks for having me. Happy to be here, Clay. Much better. It is the only clay after all. Chump. Perfect. (Nora sighs) You deserve everything coming to you. (light switch clicks) (Nora sighs) (Nora yawning) (Nora sighs) (ominous music) (Nora sighs) (ground thuds) (tense music) (Nora sighs) Just the stupid neighbor's cat again. (light switch clicks) (Nora yawns) (Nora sighs) It's freezing. (Nora sighs) (Nora yawns) (Nora sighs) (water dripping) (thunder crackles) (tense music) (dramatic music) (hand thuds) (woman groans) (kick thuds) (woman groans) (thunder crackles) Get back! Get out! (bat thuds) Get out! Get back! Get out of my house! (bat thuds) (kick thuds) (woman groans) (Nora groaning) (tense music) (thunder crackles) (eerie music) (gentle music) (woman sighs) (light switch clicks) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (Nora coughing) Hey! Let me outta here! (elbow thudding) Let me out, you psycho! People will be looking for me! (Nora grunts) (Nora screams) No! (Nora grunting) Did you really think that was gonna work? Let me out! (Nora groans) (Nora panting) You. You know who I am? Carolyn Morrison. Senator Morrison's oldest daughter, and least favorite from what I hear. Good. Saves me a lot of time. Favorite or not, that kingdom was going to be mine till you opened your big fucking mouth. Fuck! Ow! (Carolyn sighs) Do it again. I have pliers. (Nora gasps) Now, stay quiet, or I'm really gonna give you something to scream about. - No. - Now open your mouth. Open your mouth. (Nora mumbling) (siren chirps) - Shit. (Nora screaming) Shit. (Nora whimpering) Stay quiet, or I'll really give you something to scream about them. I'll kill him and throw his body back here with you. (Nora mumbling) How you doing, ma'am? Everything all right? Yeah. I just needed to take a break from driving. Nature calls. I see. You do know I am supposed to cite people for stuff like that, right? Have a heart, Officer. (Nora whimpers) You got a light? I don't smoke. Hey, you know, you look like that senator's daughter, the one who offed himself. Wait a minute, it is you. Caroline, Carolina, Carolyn, Carol- Carolyn. Carolyn. That's right. You're all over the TV. - That's me- - Oh, yeah. In the flesh. Aw, gee, I'm sorry for your loss. I've read the story. All that money gone and, well, guess that's why you're not driving one of those fancy gas guzzlers, right? I guess so. Well, Miss Morrison, don't stay out here too long, and you have a good day. My sincerest condolences to your family. Thank you, Officer. - Yeah. - You too. (shoulder thuds) (suspenseful music) Hey, you got something back there? No, I grabbed these from the back earlier and something must've fallen. You want to check, Officer? Nah, it's fine. Once again, Miss Morrison, don't stay out here too long. Have a good one. (engine rumbles) (Nora whimpering) (kick thuds) Shut up. Do you want him to die? (birds chirping) (Nora whimpering) Enough! (Carolyn slurping) (creature screeches) (tires screeching) What the fuck? (Nora screaming) (elbow thudding) (birds chirping) (Nora mumbling) Get up. All right, I'm going to remove the rag. If you scream, I will cut your tongue out. (Nora mumbling) (Nora coughing) What do you want? You want money? I'll get you money. I'll get you whatever you want. What did I say? I'm not screaming. We're gonna take a walk that way. What? I can't walk through the woods like this. What, you afraid you're gonna ruin your pedicure now you're Insta famous? Get up. Look, I'll do whatever you want. Just don't hurt me. [Carolyn] Get up. Let's go. [Nora] Where are we going? [Carolyn] Down the trail. Why? Ow, shit. - Faster. I'm going as fast as I can. Maybe I should retie your legs and make you crawl. Bitch. (creature roars) (mysterious music) What was that? - Stop stalling. (creature roars) Did you hear that? What, you've never been in the woods before? (creature roaring) Aw, fuck! (dramatic music) You can't hide. (gun fires) (gun fires) [Nora] Fuck! No! (Nora grunts) - Get up. So what, you're just gonna shoot me and leave me for the animals? Of course not. Look, I'm sorry about your dad. I didn't think- - Oh, god! I don't give a shit about my dad. Outside of this fur coat that he gave me, he can rot in the deepest depths of hell. Well, then the money, I- Oh, shut the fuck up! Jesus! Let's go! Move. [Nora] Moving as fast as I can. All right, stop. This is good. Look, you seem like a smart woman. We can make a deal. You know, my father used to take us hunting in the woods. Thought you didn't care about your father. By my house. At least that's what we told my mother. He used to make us play these games. You know, live up to the Morrison family name. This one time, he sent my brothers out on a footrace. He handed me a rifle and he told me to pick one and shoot. I picked my youngest brother. He was an annoying little shit. (Carolyn sighs) So I aimed. My father slapped it down. He said, "You don't put down an annoyance. You put down the biggest threat and you make damn sure they know it was you." Not only have you embarrassed me, not only have you taken the inheritance that I earned, but you are the biggest threat to any future that I have. And so I'm going to eliminate you and I'm gonna have fun doing it. (gun clacks) Thought you didn't care about your father? Old habits die hard. You really are crazy, you know that? Turn around. You won't get away with this. (Carolyn chuckles) People will be looking for me. Now, we're gonna play our own little game. You have a one minute head start. You can go in any direction you like. And I'll count down from five. Five. I'm not gonna get very far in a minute. - Four. It's not my concern. (gun clacks) Three. - Hold it right there! Put the gun down, nice and slow, Miss Morrison. You need to mind your business, Officer. I'm eliminating a threat. Shoot her! What are you waiting for?! Calm down, ma'am. I have this under control. We'll get you outta here. (Carolyn laughs) You shoot me, I shoot her. I got a hostage. Now I'll give you to the count of three to lower your weapon. Don't make me shoot you. Told you to mind your business, Officer. Come on now! Think of your family! You come from a good all-American family! Are you kidding me?! Ma'am, please! I'm warning you, Miss Morrison, put the gun down! [Carolyn] That's it. (gun fires) - No one needs to get hurt! Shoot her! (gun fires) Told you to leave, Officer! (gun firing) (gun fires) No! Fuck! (gun firing) (Meyers gasps) (Meyers screaming) (creature roaring) C'est la vie! Wait! Don't leave me! (creature snarls) (gun firing) (Carolyn screaming) (creature snarling) If you're not sure which streaming service to use, so you can make an informed and educated decision. Also... Hold on. We've just received word that Nora Thompson, the New York Times investigative reporter, is missing. She's missed several interviews and no one seems to be able to reach her or know her whereabouts. They're interviewing all that are close to her and also Senator Morrison's family. We will have more on this as the story develops. Next, how safe is your hybrid? The consumer reports with Becca Dane. We'll be right back. You're watching KWLF. I'm David Walker. (ominous music) (window thudding) Hello?! Hello?! Is anybody in there?! (door thudding) (Nora grunting) (door squeaking) Oh, my god, thank you. (Nora panting) (Nora grunts) Yes. (Nora grunting) (Nora panting) Yes. Yes. Yes! Fuck! (Nora sighs) No. No sleep. What the hell is that? Ew, it's disgusting. (Nora panting) (Nora whimpering) (Nora panting) (Nora whimpering) Fuck. At least it's something. (Nora panting) (Nora grunts) (Nora panting) Dammit. Yes. Okay. (lighter clicking) Come on. Oh, yes. Everything's gonna be okay. Just breathe. Oh, fuck. (newspaper rustling) (gentle music) (knife clatters) (crickets chirping) (door thuds) (Nora gasps) Jesus. Fuck! Let me in. Let me in. - And why would I do that, you evil bitch? I think it's on my tail. Please, open the door. [Nora] I don't care. You led it here, it can have you. [Carolyn] I'm injured. You tried to kill me. (Carolyn groans) I'll give you dirt. The scoop of your career. I'll get you dirt on every politician I know. I grew up with the bastards. I know all their secrets. Please, just open the door. And how do I know you want to try and jump me? (Carolyn groans) (knife tapping) - It's empty. I have nothing left. I have nothing left. Let me in. Fuck. Screw it. (Carolyn whimpers) (lock clicks) (door rumbles) Come on. Quickly, quickly (door rumbles) (door closes) (lock clicks) Easy. Easy. (Carolyn sighs) Did you get it? I mean, did you kill it? I think I wounded it earlier. This is empty. It's useless. You don't have any more bullets? I have more guns in the car, but I lost the keys. (Carolyn groans) (bag zips) (keys jingling) You have them? Whoa, what's that? - Look- - What are you doing? The way I see it, I'm the one in charge now. I got the keys and the knife and I'm not afraid to use it, you got it? [Carolyn] I got it. I hold the backpack and the weapon. [Carolyn] Okay. You're in charge. That's right. I'm in charge now. (Carolyn groans) All right, let's move you over there. Come on. (gentle music) Easy does it. (crickets chirping) Oh. Oh, this is worse than I thought. We need to get you to a hospital. Ow. Ow! That hurts. Hold still! (Carolyn groaning) All right, relax, relax, relax. (Carolyn whimpers) That looks better. All right, I'm not a doctor. What kinda animal could do this? (Carolyn sighs) Um, shouldn't you use that to clean your wounds, maybe? Shut up and take a drink. Okay. (Carolyn sighs) (Nora sniffs) (Carolyn sighs) Ew, no. That is disgustingly strong. No thank you. Disgusting. You know, we wouldn't be here if it weren't for you? You know, we wouldn't be here if you didn't go blackmailing hookers for intel? I mean, it was pretty smart, but it was painfully obvious to those of us on the inside. Oh, why didn't you stop me if you knew I was onto your dad? We're all sinners, honey. Oh, god, what I wouldn't do for a cigarette right now. Smoking kills. My body as a temple. Oh, spare me. I knew what girls like you did in college. (Nora chuckles) Girls like me? And what is that? Oh, you know, kind with a stick so far up their ass when they finally blow off steam. It's epic. (Carolyn chuckles) Yeah, that might've been me. Whatever. Let's go. Are you coming? (Carolyn groans) [Carolyn] Just one... (Nora sighs) Shit, what is that thing? I don't know. Never seen anything like it. I didn't get a close look. What about the deputy? (Carolyn sighs) I think he's dead. I don't think he survived. Have you seen anything like that in these woods before? I told you, I used to hunt by the woods near my house. These were a suggestion from a friend. A friend. Some friend. (Carolyn sighs) (Carolyn sighs) Are you okay? Mm? I'm fine. Carolyn. Carolyn. What? What? Think you might have hypothermia. I'm fine. I'm... No, you lost a lot of blood. Here, hold on one second. Here. It smells like shit, but it'll keep you warm. Lean up. (Carolyn groans) Is that okay? [Carolyn] It's fine. You don't smell that? [Carolyn] Smell what? Forget it. I think you might be in shock. Oh, no. I'm in survival mode. We need to get out of here. How? That thing is out there waiting for us. We stay here, we're sitting ducks. (Carolyn groans) It's gonna come find us. I think we should wait it out here. And wait for it to get us? How do I know that you won't jump me once we get out there? Leave me for dead? You have the keys. And I, (chuckles) I don't have the strength to fight you. (Carolyn sniffs) Is there food? No. The cabinets were empty. Wait. What are you doing? (Carolyn sniffs) Nothing. Nothing. You were just... Forget it. (Nora sighs) Here. We should at least try and dress some of those wounds. They look disgusting. At least it'll help you stop bleeding. - Jerky? (bag rustling) (Carolyn sniffs) What are you doing? Mm. I haven't eaten since this morning. (bag rustling) (creature roars) (Carolyn snoring) (creature roars) What was that? What? Oh, it must be back. [Meyers] Hello? Is anyone in there? I need help. Please! Oh, my god, it's the deputy. He must've gotten away. We have to help him. No, I'm not going out there. I thought you don't leave any people or hunters behind. That's the Marines. (Carolyn groans) If you want to help him, you go right ahead. Fuck. Okay, I'm gonna go out there and help him. You wait here. (mysterious music) (lock clicks) Hello? Deputy? [Meyers] Help! Is anyone there?! Hello? [Meyers] Hello? Please, help me. Deputy? [Meyers] Come here, please! Help! [Nora] Deputy? [Meyers] Please, help me! Is anyone there?! Deputy?! [Meyers] Over here! Where are you?! [Meyers] Please, help me! [Nora] I'm coming! [Meyers] Please! Help! [Nora] Deputy! (creek trickling) Deputy?! (water splashing) (ominous music) (creek trickling) (ominous music) (tense music) (mysterious music) Deputy! (ominous music) Deputy?! (creature snarling) Deputy! (creature snarling) (suspenseful music) (creature snarling) Deputy! (creature snarling) [Meyers] Help! - Deputy! - Please! Please! [Nora] Where are you?! [Meyers] Over here! Deputy! [Meyers] Please! Help me! Where are you?! (dramatic music) (Nora screaming) (creature roars) (creature snarling) (Nora panting) (creature snarling) (door thudding) - Carolyn, open the door! It is coming! Let me in! Please, let me in! He's coming! Carolyn, what are you doing?! Let me in! (door thudding) What are you doing?! Come on! (creature snarling) (door thudding) Carolyn, open the door! Let me in! (door thudding) What are you doing?! It's coming! Carolyn, open the door! (creature roars) (creature snarling) What are you doing?! (Nora screams) (shotgun firing) (shotgun clacking) (creature screeches) Where the hell did that come from? I found it in the closet earlier. You said you had my gun. [Nora] Shit. (Carolyn sighs) (Nora sighs) How does it feel to be hunted? Excuse me? That article you wrote, that's how my family and I felt. Look, I'm sorry. Oh, god. (Carolyn groans) Come on. Come with me. (Carolyn groans) Take a look at that. (ominous music) Okay, so what's the plan? Why are you asking me? I figured you had more experience with stuff like this? We run for the road and drive off as fast as we can. Swell. And you sure you're up to the challenge? I'm fine. It's just a flesh wound. (creature snarls) (creature roars) Fuck. It's back. (Carolyn sighs) - So how do you wanna do this? We've gotta move. Here, take it. You're gonna need this. I found it in the closet with the shotgun. [Nora] Okay. [Carolyn] It's a gun. That's the trigger. Put your finger on it and you pull. Great. Thanks. We sprint for the car. If you see the creature, shoot. [Nora] What are you doing? I look like shit. (Carolyn groans) [Nora] It's a good thing it's not a beauty contest. Oh, my gosh, I know. Okay. I don't see it. There's no eyes. Let's do this. Stay close. Don't run off without me. (crickets chirping) (Carolyn coughing) Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. (tense music) How much... (dramatic music) (Nora screams) Shh, shh! You'll lead it right to us. Don't ever touch me again. Oh, fuck. You'll give our position away. I fell onto a dead mangled body, what do you expect? [Carolyn] Calm down. You calm down. [Carolyn] Oh, shut up. It can mimic people. Yeah, looks like it. What are you doing? Trying to find something useful. You gonna stand there and watch or are you gonna help? I'm not touching him. (Carolyn groans) (Carolyn sighs) Snowflake. Sorry we didn't all grow up with a psycho dad. There's no gun. Fuck. He probably lost it in the attack. Look for his keys. He probably has more in the car. [Carolyn] Good idea. Ah. Bingo. Nice. (Carolyn groans) Are you sure you're okay? [Carolyn] Yeah. Just asking. (ominous music) (woman screaming) (creature roaring) What? - Run! Wait! Fuck! That bitch! Which way? Carolyn! Carolyn! [Carolyn] Shh. I think it's gone. Yeah, I think you're right. Think the coast is clear. (Nora screams) (shotgun firing) (creature roars) (birds chirping) (Carolyn panting) [Nora] What? What's wrong? Is it your cut? No. I'm starving. All right, well, we'll get you a steak when we get outta here. Let's just get outta here, okay? Give me the knife. - Why? - Just give me the damn knife. Look, if you try something, I will scream as loud as I can and bring that monster right to us, okay? [Carolyn] Okay. Just give it. If I die, you die. - Okay, okay. - Got it? [Carolyn] Give me the knife. You see something, run. Just hurry up. (Carolyn groans) (knife rasping) (blood squishing) (tense music) (knife rasping) Carolyn, what are you doing? Stop it! Carolyn! Stop it! What are you doing?! Please, stop. It's not enough. You're sick! Stop it! Carolyn. - It's not enough. What? Stay back. - It's not enough! - Stop! (gun fires) (Carolyn screams) Get off of me! (teeth chomps) (Nora screaming) (kick thuds) Die, you fucking bitch! (knife thudding) Die! Die! Die! Fuck! (Nora panting) Rot in hell, you fucking bitch. (Nora spits) (creature snarling) (bones crunching) (stream trickling) (gentle music) (Nora grunting) (tense music) (creature snarling) (dramatic music) (creature roars) (hand thuds) (Nora screams) (creature snarling) (creature screeches) (hand thuds) (creature snarling) (creature screeches) (creature snarling) Stop fighting, Nora. (gentle music) (creature snarling) (creature screeching) (creature snarls) (creature roars) (creature snarling) Stop fighting, Nora. Become one of us. (Nora coughing) (Nora grunting) (Nora cries) [Hill] Hey, home base, doesn't look like anybody's back here. Hello? Hello? (Nora grunting) Whoa, man. Oh, hey! Oh, my god, oh, my god. - Help me. - God. - Please, please, help me. [Hill] All right. All right. Yeah. No, no, no. - Please- - What happened to you? We have to go! We have to go now, okay?! Do you hear me?! - Can you stand up for me? Come here, come here. (Nora screams) Okay, okay. No. Come on. Come here. I'm gonna put you right here, okay? Okay? - We have to leave. [Hill] All right. Yes, we're leaving. We're leaving. - We have to leave. We're gonna get you back to the station, all right? Know what? We're gonna get you to a medic. We're going. We're going. Listen, we're gonna get you to the station. We're gonna get you to the station. We're gonna see a medic, okay? - It's coming! Please, let's go. - What's coming, ma'am? - It's coming! - Okay, yes, yes, we're going. We're going. We're going. (Nora crying) Go in. Go in. (Nora groaning) All right. (creature roaring) Stay here. (creature snarls) (creature snarling) (mellow music) Ma'am, I just checked it out. It's just to deer or something, all right? Everything's gonna be okay. What's wrong, ma'am? What's out there, ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? (tense music) I'm hungry. (dramatic music) (Hill screams) (blood spatters) (Nora screeches) (mysterious music) (tense music) (mysterious music) (tense music) (Nora screeches) (upbeat music) Welcome back. Breaking news. As we reported a few days ago, Nora Thompson, the journalist who uncovered Senator Morrison's charity scandal, has gone missing. There's still no sign of the New York Times reporter. She disappeared over a week ago when she was expected to make an appearance on several news outlets, including our very own. Police believe foul play is involved. Once again, the Morrison family has denied any involvement with her disappearance. Coming up, weather with Windy Breeze. (tense music) (creature snarling) (creature snarls) (creature screeches) (mellow music) (ominous music) (woman screams)
