Number 12. Open it. - Shall I open it? - Open it. Is he your husband, Madam? He died instantly, Mrs. Burroughs. Due to cerebral haemorrhage We still haven't found the car that hit him. How are you? Oh, you're checking Jane Burroughs out. Forget about her. Her father just died. That man is Jerome, her brother. They console each other. This is total chaos. Let's dance. Shall we? They can't stand me. I don't understand why. Who cares? Don't let them affect you. Looks like a happy family. That's the one who consoles the mother. Leris, art salesman. At least that's what he says. Whatever. And you? How come you are here alone? Well, I'll see you later. Call me if you want. Shall we go sit down? Let's go. Come on. - Put it on my tab. Sorry, your credit is no longer good. Mr. Prescott's orders. I'm sorry. I understand. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. The car. Over there! What's your name? - What's your name? - Jane. Me Tarzan. So, Jane, where are we going? What were you doing in that room? I saw you leaving the club. Why did you come back? Why did you go see Prescott? Was he your lover? Come on, don't be silly. I don't care about the two of you. If I ask you, it's because I want to help you. Come on. Let's go. I got really mad as soon as I saw Martha and Leris. I went out to let off some steam, and when I came back, I went to see Prescott. And he was there, lying on the floor. Exactly the way you found him. - Do you believe me? And your brother? Jerome left with you, is that right? I don't know where he went. Why? Why did you go see Prescott? Because he was waiting for me. It's been a week since father died. He was hit by a car. Everybody says that it was an accident, but I don't believe it. I am quite sure Prescott was trying to blackmail my father. Blackmail. Why? - What did he do? - Father? Nothing at all. He was an amazing man. Clean, honest, although a bit old-fashioned. But incapable of any wrong doing. If anyone, it's Martha. Prescott had a strange picture of her. He wanted to use it to threaten my father. This woman was so beautiful that she frightened me. Bernard, I'm trying to tell you what happened, and you're not even listening. Did you understand what I said? It's very simple. Whoever killed Prescott stole Jerome's picture. Or, if you prefer, whoever stole Jerome's picture - killed Prescott. - But why? Unless the picture was somewhere else. What are you doing? I'm going to Prescott's house. - Do you know where he lives? - 23 Belgrave Road. Wait for me here. I'm coming too. You stay here. Be careful! - It's dangerous. Throw it away. Yes, you're right. I took it just to complicate things. To feed the meter. Upstairs. Quick! The police. What-- me worry? I'm in a hurry, my friend. Give us the diary that you took from Prescott. that one. There it is. - It's me, Jane. - You scared me. - Open. - I didn't think you'd be back so early. Open, Jane. There is enough mystery in the universe. - Wait. - I'll wait. Did you find the picture? No picture. Please say something. I don't care. "Water on a woman's body is like dew on a rose petals." Lao Tse. Who's that? A Chinese poet. "Tell me about yourself, LSD." Lao Tse? Bernard, can you hear me? - Where are you? - At home. - Listen, Bernard... - At what time did you leave? I don't remember. You were asleep. Why didn't you wake me up? Tell me, Jane, why did you leave? Bernard, I can't talk to you right now, but I need to see you. - I'll be there right away. - No, you can't. Are you mad? Yes, of course. Tell me where you live. You can't come here. Let's meet somewhere else. Where? I don't know. Wherever you want. Piccadilly Circus? In front of the theatre. In 20 minutes. Bernard, I need to talk to you. Me too, but not here. Let's go inside. - They're after me. - I know. I read the newspapers. The Israeli Defence Minister sent his troops against the R.A.U. forces. The Israelis are fighting on three fronts... What did you have to tell me? The police showed up at my place. They're questioning everyone who was at Prescott's last night. - Did you see Jerome? - Who? Jerome, your brother. - Did you see him? He didn't come home last night. No. I didn't see him. The battle between the Viet Cong and the American Marines... - Does that happen often? - What? I want to know if it often happens that he doesn't come home at night. Quite often. - Where does he go? - I don't know. To see friends, girlfriends. Why are you asking me this? tell me what you're thinking. What I think, my dear Jane, is that our dear Jerome... may know a lot about all this. A demonstration against violence is being held in Trafalgar Square in London. Don't worry. We'll find him, you'll see. Come on. Let's go look for him. Why are you so quite? What should I say? - Tell me something about Jerome. - There's not much to say. He's not a big talker either. Let's look for him in the usual places. Even Edgar says that the best place to hide something is in the most obvious place. ...Dog eat dog. London citizens, let's fire up the stakes. Let's restore the death penalty, and torture. Let's condemn alcohol, smoke, gambling, sex. Let's burn the mini-skirts, and let's destroy liquor candies. Let's get rid of the homosexuals, socialists, suicides, fornicators. Enough with the modern immoral morale! Enough with the Beatles and Rolling Stones. Let's start all over again. - Who are you? - Name: Jane Burroughs. Years: 17. Nationality: English. Parents: Dead. Height: 5.4. Hair: Blonde. Eyes: Blue. - Defining features: None. - Chest: 34, - Hips? - I don't know. - Your mother didn't die. - Martha is not my mother. My mother died when I was seven. And since the day my father remarried Martha, it was like he was dead as well. I grew up with Jerome. That's why we love each other so much. He's more than a brother to me. I really wish I could have lived the life you see in those old movies. The fireplace, Sundays at the zoo. Mummy and Daddy who love each other... My father was wonderful. If he lost money in the winter, he would double the money in the summer. - And you? - I'm of Napoleon descent. - It's different for me. - Really? - I understand now! - What do you understand? I'm an actor. - Don't be foolish! - Seriously. My job is to act and to lie. - Are you acting now? - I don't know. I have really no idea why I keep following you. What do you mean, I don't know? You don't know why you're here with me? To find the picture! Of course, the picture. Tell me something, then. What's in that picture? Find it and you'll see. Is it even worth my time to get involved with all this? You're such a child. I know. I don't want to grow up. I feel like crying at the thought of me older and incapable of understanding. Understanding nothing at all. - Is that bad? It's good and bad. - No. It's not that bad. - Yes, it is. No, it's not bad. It's neither good or bad. And I'm neither good or bad. What are you then? I am who I am. Yes. I am who I am. That's it. And? And I'd like to be different, but I don't do anything to be different. And what are you? I don't know. Stop it. You still say I don't know. But I like it when you say it. Help! Wait for me! It's them again. Too bad. They ruined everything. Now what? I don't know. Let's go back to my place. - We can't. - Why not? The place is probably under surveillance. Come with me. - What are you going to do? - I'm going to call a friend. It's all right, I'm finished. Would you be so kind as to hang up the phone for me? Did I wake you up? - Yes. - I'm sorry. I need to see you. Fine. Can I stay at your place for a while? They kicked you out? Of course, come over. I'm not alone. Who's the lucky girl? Good job. So can we come over? With pleasure. When are you coming? Listen, since you know everything, do you happen to know where Jane's brother is? I don't know. If he's not at his flat, he's probably at Veronica's. Who's that? A model. She sleeps with him and works for me. Do you know where she lives? I should have her address somewhere. I'll find it for you. Don't hang up. Here we are. 12, Burns Court. - He passed out. - We should call an ambulance. - No. He's doing better. - What happened? Did someone saw what happened? How are you feeling? Are you feeling better now? - Feeling better? - It's nothing. - Yes? Who is it? - One of David's friends. I need to talk to you. Tell me. Not here. Let me come in. No. I can't now, I'm sorry. Come back later. - Who is it? - Gas inspector. Again? You were here two days ago. - I'm the inspector of the inspector. - What would there be to inspect? Those damn meters are costing us a fortune! Who is it? Postman. I have a package for you. Who are you? What do you want? What are you looking for here? "A pale olive can drive you insane." - Where is he? - You must leave now! What do you want from me? The pale-face. Do you know him? What does he want? The picture. What picture? The one he took from Prescott when he killed him. Listen, pale-face, I'm not joking. What the hell is he talking about? Who is this Prescott? - I'm calling the police! - Good. Tell her to call the police. Hang up. No need to call. So what do you want, Monsieur? Where did you go after leaving the club last night? He came here, why? At what time? Around midnight. You gave her some coaching? Listen. Enough now. Who the hell do you think you are? Jane's tutor? Jane was kidnapped. No. This is too funny. Who is it? - Jane, let me speak to Jerome. I beg you, - do what they tell you. - Where are you? Jane is safe, but in order to have her back you must pay Â£10,000, right away. Tonight at 9:00, northern exit of the zoo. Alone and no tricks! May I know what's going on? First this fool breaks in, then this mysterious call... - Calm down. - What's going on? How did you know? I was with her when it happened. - Who did it? - You should tell me that. All I know is that a black Buick stopped next to Jane and a black man shoved her inside the car. While you were there watching the scene. A midget hit me on the head. - A midget. - Yes, a midget. - A midget. - Yes, a midget. - What? - Let me think. - A midget then... - Listen. - Don't joke with me. - The midget is one of Leris' men. Let's go see him. - But... Let's go. Quick. Leris is not that stupid to keep Jane at his place. Where do you think she is then? At the KM docs. - Why there? - That's where the midget works. ls it here where we can catch the Bateaux Mouches? Excuse me? The Bateaux Mouches. Come take a look. The boat. - Speak. Where's the midget? Behind the cemetery. Next to the ruins-- What's happening? What was it, Bob? Please, Bob! Talk to me. Count to 10. Then kick the door open. Untie me, quick! My dress. Bernard! Quick. Let's go. Liar. What are you doing? I'll see you at the "Flipper." Now it's enough, we're going to the police. - Stop it. - Why did you lie to me? - I didn't lie to you. You pretended you didn't know where Jerome was. And what about the phone call? Oh, that's the reason. You are so stupid. I didn't know where he was. The midget knew. He was the one to call. I swear. You really don't believe me? You must believe me. Tickets. Who needs to buy tickets? Where are you going? Wherever you are going. Two tickets. Tickets. Who needs to buy tickets? - So do you believe me? Not yet. Try again. - Again. - Stop it. Everybody is looking at us. What's the harm? I'm such an idiot. You just want to have fun. Of course, you're right. Luckily this story is almost over. All we need to do - is to go talk to your mother's lover. - Leris? Yes. why? Finally. Did you find Jerome? You could be successful at this. You never know. In this business you just need to be photogenic. I'll take some shots of her when I get back. "I'll tell you anyway that the best colour for a wonderful body is not the green of a lawn nor the blue of the lakes, but the black of a photo studio." Michelangelo Antonioni. Wait. What are you doing? Leris may be in the gallery. It's connected to his apartment. - Is Leris in? Get the car! Who was that? He's one of Prescott's men. His name is Jelly-Roll. He thinks I killed him. Watch out! One, two, three, out! Damn it! Quick! Come on! Hurry up! Stop! Where are they? There they are! Look for them that way. Hurry up. Come here. - Come on. - Let's go! They're over there! Get in, quick! They were able to get in. - We need to separate. - What? I will get off on the next stop and I'll have them follow me. - But, I-- - You go to David's place. - I want to go with you. - Stop it! Remember, you must find Jerome. I'll join you later. I hope, at least. Don't be afraid. It won't be that easy for you to get rid of me. Don't leave David's place for any reason. Understood? There he is. Quick, let's go. Over there! Come on! Run! Careful! Come on. Go there! Stop! You're trapped! Spit it out! I'll make you talk. I'll make you scream. I'll make you piss blood. I'll make you beg. I'll make you howl... ...so much -- and no one will hear you. Enough. Where's the diary? You better talk before I finish. Counting your eyelashes. You speak, you don't speak. The girl that was with me has it. Where is she? She's waiting for me in town. Let him go. He'll take us where she is. Hurry up! Open your mouth. Go and keep your mouth shut. - The police. - Pass them, come on! Unit 18. Send an ambulance. There was an accident. Two injured and a third one was arrested. He was carrying a loaded gun. One fled the scene. We don't know who they are. We'll bring them to the station for questioning. They were driving a black Jaguar, licence plate XY5243. Get closer. A bit more. Turn to the side. Look at me. Turn around. What happened to you? I thought actors had doubles for dangerous scenes. I do my own stunts. Come lay down. Do you have some bandages or something like that? What's wrong, Bernard? Not feeling good? No. I'm tired. Tired of this mystery. You don't believe me anymore. "The truth is that working hard without ever deflecting from the principles of revolution, will give people nice, harmonious and strong backs." It's not worth it. Nothing makes sense. Like in the movies. Shut up. Let me at least love you, my angel. I'll feel better again through you. Yes! Me too. Are you done? - Come down as soon as you can. Veronica is here with her friend. The long gone brother. Can you show me the last pictures? They are here. Take a look. Jerome is here! Did you hear me? - Oh, those are nice! - Yes, we heard you. Look at these! These are wonderful. I waited for you forever at the Flipper. Where's Martha? Why? Did you go home? Just for a moment. - Was she there? - Where's my coat? She was getting in when I was leaving. Why? I'd like to know what's going on. Got your car? Take us there. - Where? - Home. May I ask why? We have to speak with Martha. She won't be there. Why? - She went out. - Go on. She went to a happening. She wanted me to take her there. We'll go, too. But-- - But we weren't invited. - We'll go anyway. I don't have the right outfit. - I can't. - Don't worry, baby. You look great the way you are. - I'm coming too. - No, Josephine. Not tonight. Go to sleep. He does not like me. - Let it go. - Come on. Let me look at you. Not bad at all. Come with me. We'll have some fun anyway. What does Martha have to do with anything? Leris was murdered. Why did you do it? Do what? You know what I'm talking about. You've got to be kidding me. Leris' murder is not a joke. You are mad. Perhaps. Where did you go last night when you left Prescott's club with Leris? - The French one. Prescott's killer, I presume. So what did Leris do last night? I have already told the police. He took me to his place, and we stayed there all night till dawn. Why? Where's Leris? In his bathtub. Cadaver. Do you recognise this? It belongs to Jane. Where did you find it? Next to Leris' body. I knew it. I knew it that she was still his lover. She did it. Jane killed him. Come on, let's go. I don't care what you did. No, I can't Bernard. Go away. You have nothing to do with me anymore. Here. This is your earring. You can't do it, Jane. You can't. Why don't you understand? I can't. I really can't. And I don't want to. Go ahead then. Try- Shoot.
