- Well, in space, you feel like your... your small self is part of a greater whole. That could really mess you up, you know. Hum... Like a second chance for humanity. - What do you mean? Hum? - And that everything goes too fast. We spent our lives dreaming of this moment, Bernard. - And now, here we are, living the dream. - What you see is reality, I guess... - Oh, it's... to be perfectly honest with you, Bernard, it's quite boring. We feel rather far from our mothers... - Not much, really, Bernard... We take walks, we pick up rocks... This way, the scientists who sent us up here can actually and see for themselves just how boring this place really is... - Oh, you bet! because we had an unexpected visit this morning. A girl by the name of Avril was transported here via teleportor. - We'd like to, Bernard, but the teleportor was designed to bring people to Mars, and not necessarily back to Earth. Hum... Besides, there seems to be a reason for the girl's presence up here... - Ah... - Sorry, Bernard, we're... we seem to be having a hard time receiving you. - No! On Mars? No. You're not there yet. You're down to Earth. - Alcohol and dreams do not mix. Be careful. At your age, some dreams can be deadly. - But the story is not over yet. Wake up now. You're alive. - Well, well, well. Here we go again! - What is it this time? - Ah... it's our turn to make a little confession... - In fact... - See? Come here. This is where we shot the landing. - And the whole scene with the teleportor, remember? That was shot right here. - Dude, it's a prop. - All it said in the script is that would join us on Mars. The rest is up to your imagination. is right there.
