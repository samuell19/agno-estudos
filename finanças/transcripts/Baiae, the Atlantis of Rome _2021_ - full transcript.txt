(ATMOSPHERIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS) (WAVES LAP GENTLY) NARRATOR: Off the coast of Naples, a team of Italian researchers is surveying the volcanic structures below the surface of the Mediterranean. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) The island of Ischia itself is an active volcano. It's part of a volcanic arc, which includes Mount Vesuvius and the area known as the Phlegraean Fields. It is a name of Greek origin, from 'flago' - 'to burn'. But it was the Romans who made the most of the area, making the Phlegraean Fields key to the growth of the Roman Republic and later the Empire. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) (BIRD SQUAWKS) 1.8 square kilometres of streets, buildings, mosaics, Roman statues. Under a few metres of water, the sea of the Phlegraean Fields hides the largest underwater archaeological park in the world... ..a haven for archaeologists, researchers and underwater enthusiasts. Most of these archaeological treasures were part of the glittering city of Baiae, built in the middle of the Gulf of Pozzuoli. Well known today as an archaeological park, its fame is also due to the tireless work of Gennaro Di Fraia. (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) Hundreds of dives and surveys from the 1980s allowed him to be the first to map this ancient city. GENNARO DI FRAIA: Gennaro Di Fraia's map of the submerged Baiae was key in 2002 to the creation of the archaeological park. Since then, Baiae has been a protected area. But centuries of pillaging and the effects of the saltwater are a constant threat for this unique World Heritage Site. Studying, protecting and preserving this treasure is the task of a multidisciplinary team from the Italian Istituto Centrale del Restauro, made up of underwater restorers, technicians and archaeologists... (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) ..a never-ending task across a huge area to restore the structures already known and identify new ones. (BREATHING MACHINE HISSES) Leading the operations is Barbara Davidde, who heads the underwater archaeological research teams at the institute. BARBARA DAVIDDE: The restorer Riccardo Mancinelli is heading towards one of the identified buildings - a residential villa with a particular access. It is known as Villa With A Prothyrum Entrance because of the monumental portico above the main entrance door. The focus of today's mission is a mosaic floor that decorated a room in the north-west area of the villa. BARBARA DAVIDDE: (MACHINE HISSES) Before studying the collapsed floor, the team has to remove the sand covering the mosaic with an underwater vacuum cleaner. It's a delicate operation. RICCARDO MANCINELLI: There were dozens of villas like this in Baiae. It was, in fact, an offshoot of Rome itself - a centre of rest and recreation for the most important Roman citizens. DIANE FAVRO: I think Baiae and the whole region was incredibly important in influencing ideas about Rome. The first emperor had a villa there. His heirs did, others, emperors and important senators. And this was a big trading emporium. Traces of its former glory are also visible on the mainland. The present town has developed right on top of the pre-existing Roman structures. Behind it lies the remains of an imposing thermal complex. The baths were an important institution in Ancient Rome. It was pleasure. It was social. It was like a club. It was where you can discuss things. In those baths, water would be heated by furnaces, using a technical system famous as hypocaust - a floor lifted from the ground up, underneath which hot air and hot gases circulated. It's sort of like what we call in modern architecture panel heating of a space. That is the artificial system. The baths of Baiae were different and unique. To produce heat, they used the volcanic nature of the Phlegraean Fields. (WHOOSHING) Baiae produced so much and such a variety of hot gases, hot wet vapours, that they did not need to use artificial systems to heat the space as well as to heat the water. It was naturally heated. It required a rather sophisticated and dangerous engineering to conduct the hot gases from below the earth, through conduits, through canals, up to the surface and heat the bathing structures that they had constructed and heat the water and heat the space with this natural sort of nature-given hot sources. The baths were everywhere in Baiae, often in private houses. The remains of the thermal facilities are still clearly visible in the area of the Villa With A Prothyrum Entrance. The villa continues to reveal new information about Roman structures and construction techniques. Salvatore Medaglia is one of the archaeologists in the team. SALVATORE MEDAGLIA: The villa had also a large garden. Salvatore Medaglia has recognised some fragments of a column. To get an idea of the structure, he tries to put them back together. To the guests of the house, the garden must have looked like this, opening out to a splendid view of the sea. All of these treasures are now submerged under several feet of water. What had happened? SALVATORE PASSARO: Calderas are large cauldron-like hollows formed as a result of the sinking of the magma chamber of a volcano after an eruption. Because of this movement of the earth, the entire coastline has sunk over the centuries and, today, much of ancient Baiae lies underwater, and needs to be preserved. It is not an easy task for the restorers - the guardians of the treasure. New problems always need new solutions. RICCARDO MANCINELLI: The blocks first need to be fixed with strong straps attached to a lifting balloon into which air is pumped, but not too quickly, otherwise the huge block might rise suddenly and break free, putting the operators and the floor itself in danger. The floor is finally cleared and the job can be completed. Many advances in underwater restoration come from the insight and commitment of Roberto Petriaggi, a world-renowned underwater archaeologist, who's worked for the Istituto Centrale del Restauro for 30 years. ROBERTO PETRIAGGI: The binding agent that's always been used for building on land is mortar. The one used for underwater restoration needs to harden immediately, even in water. It was the Romans who invented it over 2,000 years ago in this very area. They added pozzolana to the mixture, the sand of Pozzuoli, a volcanic powder which makes the mortar bind in water. BARBARA DAVIDDE: (BIRD SQUAWKS) It was not uncommon for villas to extend out to sea. Luxury was the way of life in Baiae, and wealth had to be flaunted. DIANE FAVRO: Everybody built. And if you built a villa, your neighbour had to make his or hers bigger and better, and then the next one had to be bigger and better. I don't mean city in an administrative way, but an integrated group of buildings, pools, the whole thing. A spa city, if you'd like to think of it that way. It doesn't have a forum. What is it? Well, it's part of a bigger metropolitan resort area, but not just resort. Baiae was more the residential area of the wealthy. Building on the hills allowed for one of the most appreciated luxuries - enjoying a wonderful view. And, at the same time, being visible from far out to sea. Today, the Archaeological Museum of the Phlegraean Fields is housed in the Castle of Baiae. Several rooms showcase the treasures found in the underwater park. Before the castle, an imperial villa stood here. Archaeological investigations have brought to light several floors, statues and frescoed walls. Dating of the decorations and contemporary accounts suggest that the villa belonged to Emperor Julius Caesar. (BIRDS SQUALL) On the other side of the bay, at the Punta dell'Epitafio, another villa has been identified. FIKRET YEGUL: This was that Punta, which also has remains of some ancient villa. Over here, which today is underwater, is a big hall, rectangular with a great, big apse, belonging to Roman Emperor Claudius. How do we know that? Because inside this apsidal hall there are statues of the Claudian Family, the Imperial Family. And in the apse, the small apse, there is a group statue of recreating the myth of the blinding of Cyclops, the giant with a single eye, by Ulysses. This construction was called a 'nymphaeum', used as a banqueting hall and located in the lower part of the villa. On one side there was also a private thermal complex attached to the villa. Luxurious villas in a beautiful natural setting. "Nothing in the world shines brighter than the Gulf of Baiae," wrote the poet Horace admiringly. Several ancient sources refer to a mysterious Baiaen lake, which housed the city's port. GENNARO DI FRAIA: On February 20, 1985, during an aerial survey of Baiae, Gennaro Di Fraia discovered clear evidence of the mysterious lake. Before his eyes, two, long, artificial wharves appeared - proof that the ancient sources could be trusted. The channel was over 200 metres long and 32 metres wide. This was the access to the Lacus Baianus mentioned in the literary sources - the access to the shorefront of the splendid Baiae. (WAVES LAP GENTLY) Nearly 30 years earlier in 1956 a similar structure had been discovered by chance by Pilot Commander Raimondo Bucher flying in the area between Pozzuoli and Baiae, a seemingly much larger waterway. What could have been its function? (BIRDS SQUALL) Between Baiae and Pozzuoli lies the small lake of Lucrino. In Roman times it was larger, but a volcanic event completely changed the landscape. The Lucrino was a shallow saltwater lagoon, ideal for breeding a particular species of shellfish. It wasn't like the sea with the crashing waves and everything, so they liked the gentleness of the water, and they used those waters for oyster culture. We certainly know about the Lucrinus. That's the wealthy, like Sergius Arata, had oyster beds, and that's another luxury. You could just see them drinking wine from the hills of Rome and eating oysters. Lake Lucrino and a second lake behind it, Lake Avernus, renowned as the entrance to the underworld, took on another function when in 37 BC they were transformed by Emperor Augustus into a military port, a port shipyard to strengthen the naval fleet and train new crews. As reported by the historian Strabo, it created a secure harbour and became a productive shipyard, using materials from the woods around Lake Avernus. A canal was built to connect Lake Avernus with Lake Lucrino. The thin strip of land separating Lucrino from the sea was reinforced with concrete. A large canal linked to the sea was also built, over 300 metres long. The waterway, which Commander Bucher had identified, was, in fact, the access to the military port of Emperor Augustus known as Portus Julius. It was such a great engineering feat that people talked about it, Virgil talked about it, others talked about it, saying, you know, "This is the greatest engineering thing of our lifetime." In a hall near Punta dell'Epitafio, a new structure is under investigation... ..an area of floor known as 'opus sectile'. These are polychrome marbles, mostly those with red streaks on a black background, known as 'African marble' - materials that are not available in Italy. Where did they come from? How did they get to Baiae? Puteoli, today Pozzuoli, was the most important harbour and trading area in the Mediterranean. Of the imposing pier, resting on 15 pylons and 372 metres long, today only a collection of drawings and some engravings are left. One of the greatest works of maritime engineering of antiquity, it is sadly entirely hidden by the modern pier. Maritime trade made the city particularly wealthy, as shown by the remains of several buildings - the 'macellum', for example, the great food market of the city built near the port. From the columns still in place, we can deduce that the building must have been substantial, probably two storeys high. The imposing Flavian amphitheatre, dating from the 1st century AD, is second in size only to the colosseums in Rome and Capua. Up to 40,000 spectators could be seated on its benches. The hypogeum, or basement, is perfectly preserved and retains its air of mystery. In order to supply the large population, the port occupied a vast area - a maze of roads, residences, and, above all, 'horrea', the warehouses for the goods, which extended along the whole coastline up to Lake Lucrino. It now took the place of the military port that, in the meantime, had been moved to nearby Miseno. (BIRDS SQUALL) In the natural shelter of a volcanic crater, the port of Cape Miseno became the base of the Roman imperial fleet. It could accommodate over 250 warships and thousands of crewmen. In order to guarantee the fleet's enormous need for drinking water, an imposing cistern, now known as the Piscina Mirabilis, was built. As tall as a five-storey building, it could hold 12 million gallons of drinking water. For five centuries, it was the largest cistern ever built by the Romans. The restorers begin by cleaning the structures to check the state of preservation and plan the works. As so much of the decay of submerged structures comes from marine organisms, laboratory research is key. Restoration work on the Villa Dei Pisoni is almost complete. It is the only house in Baiae whose owner's name is known with certainty. Gennaro Di Fraia's research group is behind the discovery. GENNARO DI FRAIA: To visually recreate the structure and appearance of the Villa Dei Pisoni, Di Fraia is working on a 3-D model using his own research and the recent underwater acoustic surveys from Salvatore Passaro of the CNR. (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) (TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS) (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) Another team is working west of the nymphaeum of Punta dell'Epitafio in an area called Baths Of The Lacus, where a floor with a polychrome mosaic has been located. A section of the floor collapsed, creating a gap in the mosaic. As well as the biological factors, all of Baiae's underwater structures are affected by the force of the sea. MARCO CIABATTONI: Roberto Petriaggi and Barbara Davidde carry out an inspection to assess the state of the site and plan the restoration operations. The floor is badly damaged and is very uneven. To find the answer they first need to remove the debris. Barbara splits the group into two teams. One will excavate inside the gap and the other will restore the structure. (MOTOR WHIRRS) By digging, archaeologists want to confirm the probable existence of an earlier floorplan. If they find it, it could be proof that the floor was built twice on two levels, evidently to counteract the effects of the movement of the sea floor. If this is the case, archaeologists will be able to estimate a date for the beginning of the sinking. The second team proceeds with the strengthening operations. Next step is to choose the colour of the mortar to secure the mosaic tiles. Barbara Davidde uses photographic images to get an initial colour reference. (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) There is no such thing as pre-coloured mortar, and, like alchemists, restorers have to create them on the spot. (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) The mixture shouldn't appear too smooth, so some granular minerals are added to give a more varied look. Riccardo and Adriano have prepared samples of mortar called test blocks to be examined and compared underwater, where light has different effects on colour. The newly prepared mortar mustn't be the same colour as the existing one because, while respecting the colour tone and appearance of the original mortars, the restoration work must always be recognisable. While the team carries out its never-ending restoration work, Gennaro Di Fraia continues his research. At about 400 metres from the ancient coastline between Baiae and Pozzuoli lies an area known as Secca Delle Fumose - Smoky Shoal - because of the gaseous emissions rising from the seabed. The researchers have found some impressive structures here - 28 huge submerged towers called 'pilae' enclosing an area of over 16,000 square metres. The function of these structures in the middle of the sea has no immediate explanation and represents a fascinating underwater enigma. Other sources, such as the Greek geographer Pausanias, refer to an artificial island built in the Gulf of Pozzuoli... ..this theory supported by a Roman fresco now lost but that we know existed thanks to a 17th-century reproduction known as the Bellori Drawing. Could the underwater towers of the Smoky Shoal then be the foundations of an artificial island? Di Fraia is on the quest for tangible evidence to provide an answer to this fascinating mystery. In the area of the Lacus baths, the excavation of the pavement has been completed. Learning of the beginning of a bradyseismic phenomenon that forced the inhabitants to raise the floor levels in the 3rd century AD was a decisive discovery. This could have been the beginning of the end - the gradual sinking of the ground, which forced the residents to abandon their villas, and progressively led Baiae, one of the brightest stars in the firmament of Rome, to be extinguished. Gennaro Di Fraia is still busy trying to find an answer to the mystery of the Smoky Shoal. Of the three hypotheses, that of the baths in the middle of the sea, seems to be the most plausible. The idea that it was a lighthouse does not seem to be borne out. Neither is there evidence that the pilae belonged to a port structure. But further inspection of the seabed reveals collapsed areas that offer new suggestions. The traces of the collapse are evident. But, to the expert eye of Gennaro Di Fraia, some pilae reveal specific new clues. Some tracks are still clearly visible, as well as the folds for the support of the platform in the upper part of the pilae. A further theory that this is for a second entrance to the Lucrino is also discounted. In addition to the Bellori Drawing, other frescoes discovered in nearby coastal villas show buildings built on basements in the middle of the sea. So, the hypothesis of an artificial thermal island seems to have solid foundations. And, to support it, there are other ancient sources. (STATIC) On the bottom of the Secca a hot spring is still active today. But it is too small to make the idea of a thermal spa viable. It appears, however, that there are others. Si. Measurements are taken of the strength of the water flow and the temperature. The water is very hot, exceeding 70 degrees Celsius. Some sections of the sandy bottom are also hot. The area affected by the phenomenon is quite large. This data will make it possible to flesh out the hypothesis of a spa platform in the middle of the sea. But could these emissions have been stronger 2,000 years ago, bringing the heat of the entire water column to the surface? A clue to the answer could come from Salvatore Passaro. The CNR, together with the University of Sannio, is conducting an experiment using innovative thermal probes. And it's in the Smoky Shoal that the study begins. SALVATORE PASSARO: In Roman times then these springs were perhaps both more consistent and hotter. Gennaro Di Fraia's investigation now focuses on the area behind the pilae, towards the coast. Di Fraia comes across something unexpected. It's an exceptional find. These are the remains of the formworks, the wooden frames commonly used in Roman masonry employed to build the pilae. GENNARO DI FRAIA: Di Fraia's research will continue. Valuable pieces have been added to the puzzle, making the hypothesis of the artificial spa island more and more concrete. (BIRDS SQUALL, WIND WHIFFS) The Villa With A Prothyrum Entrance continues to offer surprises. A new floor is coming to light. It is a mosaic with black and white tiles. The uncovered part shows three fish. The mosaic isn't well preserved, and immediate restoration work is necessary. Barbara Davidde dives down to check the situation. First she tests how the tiles are fixed to the floor. The mosaic is in good condition, but the fish designs have deteriorated. (SPEAKS IN ITALIAN) Time is short for full restoration. The two most damaged fish will have to wait for the next mission. The third one is missing only a few tiles and will be treated immediately. Adriano begins to prepare the bedding plan, but first he needs to collect the necessary number of tiles. Unlike the white, the black ones seem to have vanished. MARCO CIABATTONI: Fortunately, Marco was able to find enough black tiles to proceed. Now it is up to Adriano to complete the work of arranging and fixing them. On land such a job is complex enough. Underwater it's a lot more difficult. ADRIANO CASAGRANDE: The continuing restoration works are for now completed, but new missions are already being planned. The remarkable and diligent work of the restorers will begin again amongst the underwater splendour of these remains to safeguard their memory and pass it on to future generations.
