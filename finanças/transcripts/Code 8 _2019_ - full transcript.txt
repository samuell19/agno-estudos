FEMALE: Certainly, power-enabled people were invited to Lincoln City to help with manufacturing and construction. MAN: I suppose, yes, this was a time when the usefulness of those skills outweighed the potential dangers. MAN: Nobody knew why some people had powers, but as long as they were effective workers, it didn't matter. FEMALE: We were fire fighters, police officers. We were doctors, for heaven's sake. We used our powers to help people. ANNOUNCER: This is automation. Today's way of manufacturing. MAN: But economically speaking, over time, those with powers were no longer in demand. Machines could do what they could do. REPORTER: Hundreds are out of work and more layoffs are expected. MAN: No, no, no, I didn't say we wouldn't hire a powered person. I said we wouldn't hire an unregistered powered person. Big difference. DJ: We're talking powered on LC Radio, 88 FM. You're on the air. I can't get a job cleaning toilets. - It's pretty fucking bad... - (sirens blaring) DJ: Whoa, whoa, you can't say that on the radio. REPORTER: The new highly-addictive street drug is called Psyke.

Okay, thanks, hon. (sizzling) (water running) (gasps) So, answer the question. If you were a vegetable, what kind of vegetable would you be? We're really gonna do this right now? We are doing this. Okay, fine. A tomato. A tomato. It's a fruit and a vegetable, so it's versatile. Like me, you know? I can do different things. Is that what you're gonna say if they ask you that? Tough crowd, okay, how would you answer it? I would be an onion. - An onion. - Mm-hmm. Why? Because, they have so many layers. And so do I. (chuckles) It's good. Wow. It's a good thing I'm the one interviewing, 'cause that is a brutal answer. (chuckling) Mom, they're getting worse. They're fine. Mom, if anything were to happen to you... Nothing's gonna happen to me. Hey. I'm not going anywhere. Eat. You don't wanna be late. (telephone ringing in background) Connor Reed? Yeah. (ringing phone) MAN ON RADIO: We be the ones to run and hide? They commit the crimes, let them run and hide. How about that for an idea? I don't care if they're born with powers. WOMAN ON RADIO: I agree, they're dangerous. MAN ON RADIO: I'm sick of them, I'm not afraid to say it. Get moving. Tommy, for Christ's sake, every time. I got another load coming in 15, let's go, you're killing me! CONNOR: Joe. You need another one? I did, an hour ago. CONNOR: Oh man, I could really use this. JOE: Yeah, well, life is about timing, Conner, and today yours is for shit. You got another load coming in 15, truck's pretty full. I'm only giving you a half day. I missed an hour. Take it or leave it, I'm good either way. CONNOR: Yo. Sup, how'd the job interview go? Oh, crushed it, yeah, start Monday, full benefits, corner office. MALE: Sounds like a dream. (smooth music) (engine running) PILOT: D-1-0-6, arriving at 162 West Lake. Three workers spotted out front Guardians standing by. TOWER: 10 Alpha 20, drone support has landed. You are clear to approach. MEGAPHONE: Attention. This is the LCPD. All workers are to come outside for identification. 10 Alpha 20 at 162 West Lake. You the foreman? JOE: Yes, can I help you? We got a call about powers being used. Uh, it'd be the first time I heard anything about that. All right! Everyone line up. Let's go! All right, caps off, chins to the sky. PILOT: Yeah, half of these guys are enabled. Anybody with ability can pack up your shit, you're done for the day. You wanna use powers, get a permit next time. Yeah, who's got money for that shit?

If it were me I would've lit your ass up. COP: I got a room! (suspenseful music) Go. Oh, Christ. We got it. REPORTER: Eight are hospitalized after police raid another Psyke farm in the lower East Side. The debate continues whether those giving up their spinal fluid should be treated as victims or traffickers. Thanks to the courageous work of our drug unit, we are winning the war on Psyke. While it is easy to celebrate the success of this operation we must not forget that violent cartels continue to poison our neighborhoods. The LCPD have also released the following video, of which they've come to call the Psyke run, a monthly trip to a facility where the drug is incinerated. It's their way of saying, the more you make, the more we burn. Mary, why is this frozen? This can't keep happening. Your episodes, or whatever it is you call this, it's costing me money, okay, so from here on out, this is coming out of your goddamn paycheck. Hey, don't talk to my mom that way. Connor, hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Go wait in the car, honey. MANAGER: Yeah, go wait in the car. What was that? I'm talking to Mommy, you should go wait in the car. You should shut the fuck up. Connor, stop it. Stop it! You need to leave. Right now. Go. I'm so sorry, I'll clean this up. You, too. How many times do I have to tell you, never show anyone your power? What about you? Frozen sauce on the ground, how'd that happen? You need to start chemo. We don't have the money. I'll sell the truck. MARY: It's not gonna be enough. Then I'll get more money, whatever it takes. You sound exactly like your father. Oh my god, please don't bring him into this. Well then quit acting like him! I was five. I barely remember. (distant siren) CONNOR: Did you know that guy yesterday? Nah. I never seen him before. Me neither. Here we go, all right. Get shot, you fucking loser! (indistinct yelling) - Punk ass bitch. - You gonna throw and run? God damn. (clattering) What the hell's Lincoln Power doing here? Nah, you don't wanna fuck with them. Buddy, that's Sutcliffe's crew. Bunch of Psyke runners. (dramatic music) I need an Electric, class two at least. So nobody wants to get paid today? Okay. All right. I'm an Electric. Need 200 up front, though. (chuckles) Is that so? Yo, fuck this guy. Class two. Okay. 200 up front. Get in the van. (upbeat music) What? GARRETT: He wants you to put it on. Fine, just say it, then. He can't speak, dick. (upbeat music) 10 thousand volts, you better be worth the money. I'm on a clock, come on, come on. (tense music) (zaps) Son of a bitch. Giving up? (zapping, crackling) - (explosion) - (Connor yells) Yo-ho. (panting) Class two? - (sizzling) - (clattering) All right, let's do it. (dramatic music) GARRETT: Maddy, get us six. New guy, help Freddie. CONNOR: Fuck. Idiot. MAN: Hey! How you doing? What the hell's going on here? Fence was shorted, got called to fix it. I'm gonna need to see some ID. Yeah of course, we'll be right back. Just hold it right there, please. I need some back up... No, no no no. RADIO: What was that? I didn't see anything. No. Now. I'll just go... My friend's gonna squash your head. Get in the fucking dumpster. You're just gonna leave him in there? Yeah, I mean, he has a flashlight, so. (muffled calls) Let's go, in the van! TOWER: All units in zone nine, got a report of a break in at Jones Chemical. Suspects last seen in a red cargo van headed east on Short Avenue. Just pay me out. Drop me off. Job's not done. Sit tight. MADDY: Fuck, these things are everywhere. PILOT: 1-1-3, no sign of vehicle. TOWER: I need additional eyes in zone nine. PILOT: D-1-0-8, responding, entering zone nine. MADDY: Garret? GARRETT: Relax, you'll scare the new guy. (tense music) Start peeling, let's go. (distant alarms) (squealing brakes) PILOT: I got a cargo van heading south on Franklin. Descending below 100. - (propellers) - MADDY: Fuck. GARRETT: Stay calm. TOWER: 1-1-3, what's the call? (tense music) PILOT: Negative. Vehicle doesn't match description. Moving on. (dramatic music) (drone accelerates) MADDY: Fuck, that was close. We got it. Where's Sutcliffe? Let's go. (footsteps) You saw the news, right? (coughing) It was my farm in Riverton that got raided two days ago. I mean, the cops grabbed all my shit... You read minds, do you not, Mr. Sutcliffe? (techno music) Read theirs. Tell me what they're thinking. (music distorts) She's thinking of different ways of slitting my throat. You have one week to pay. Otherwise we will be forced to make alternate plans for ourselves. And for you. (techno hip hop music) They have enough hyrdo to make Psyke for a year. Who's the new kid? Connor, this is Marcus Sutcliffe. Connor. Anger. No, no, no, no. Useful. Nia, will you show this young man around, please? You and I need to talk. (hip hop music) NIA: What do you want? Nothing, I'm good. (Nia coughs) You sure? It's on Marcus. Booze, girls. Psyke. Nah, just passing through. Passing through, right. I can't pay you, not right now. I've got three drums in the back of my van. Head office said that they are done waiting. We need money to keep those wolves at bay. If we don't get them something soon, they are gonna come calling. And not just for me, do you understand? How good is that Electric? The kid? Yeah, he's strong, he doesn't know how strong yet. Look, I've got a lead on something real. Something good. I need time to work him. Get on him now. You do this job for me and you are right back where you were. Right back where I was, and more. (coughing) Get them back. What about you? What do you do here? He needs you. He needs you now. NIA: I'll see you around. Okay. Connor. We got another job coming up. Make a lot more money than you made today. 300 bucks. Consider it a bonus for tonight. You wanna make more, we'll see you tomorrow morning. You got talent. Don't waste it. (knocking) Just get in? Yeah, got picked up late for a job. Wow, didn't know you were working. Yeah, uh, it was construction. Job's behind so the pay was pretty good. Great. I went back to the store today and got my old job back. Mom, that guy's an asshole. He is, but we need the money. I know, I just, I don't like you working there. I don't like it either, but 'til that money tree blooms in the backyard, we don't have much of a choice. Yeah, yeah, wouldn't that be nice. It's gonna be okay. I know it doesn't seem like that right now, but, it's all gonna work out. Yeah. (low voices, giggling) Come on. I want some more. (woman laughs) MARCUS: What do you want? I'm out. MARCUS: Get out. - Why, we're having... - Get the fuck out! WOMAN: Bitch. Is this what you want? Come and get it. No, no. Come on. Me first. Mm-hmm. (sniffs) No cams but it's definitely Psyke related. Why he took the Hydro, 200 gallons. Sutcliffe's watering down his shit that bad and you know he's hurting. What else we got? Yeah. Guard was attacked by a TK and a Brawn. Pyro blew the lock, and Electric fried the whole fence. PARK: How many Electrics in town that strong? Let's see who fits the profile. DAVIS: I'll work up some names. So how was your job yesterday? It was fine. It was weird, I don't know. Pay was good. Yeah? You gotta be careful with those guys. I know. (light honking) TRAVIS: Let's do this. (indistinct yelling) Gentlemen, listen up. I need a full day, six crew, two Brawn, two Electric. (indistinct yelling) Let's go. WORKER: Come on, man, what are you talking about, you can always use one. WORKER: I was good in the last one. See you tomorrow. JOE: Not using you, understand? WORKER: Come on, man. (bluesy music) I don't know what that means. He wants your bacon. Yeah, yeah, it's fine. You know, I'm wondering why a guy like you is associating himself with a group of degenerates like us. Who you calling degenerates? Fred, you hear this shit? You found me. You got in the van. Why? I need money. Could've got in any other truck. Paid a semi-honest day's work. They don't pay enough. For what? Doesn't matter. It matters to me. We need to know who we're working with. My mom's sick. Okay. We'll see what you can do. Let's go. He says good luck. Thanks. See this car? We need it. Short the alarm. What? What you looking down there for, car's right here. (alarm blaring) Fuck. What the hell's going on, I thought there was a job. Yeah, there is, in three days we're knocking over a bank, and you're nowhere near ready. So until then, you stick with me, you do what I do, and you do as I say. Short the alarm. What's my cut of the bank? 25K. (alarm continues) - (zapping) - (Conner grunts) (clicks) GARRETT: Your mother raised you on her own? Dad died when I was young. Safe to assume he was one of us. Yeah, Electric. Got shot holding up a liquor store. So your mom raised you without powers to make sure you didn't end up like him. (inspirational music) Light it. And keep it lit. (sparking) (zaps) Come on, man, I just need a little bit more time, alright? GARRETT: Not a fucking clock. Where's the money? Nobody wants to buy that hydro shit, man! (screaming) You know we built this city, right? Ran the mills, we built the buildings, we built the roads. Then they brought in these machines, not to drive the profit line, they did it to drive us out. Because normal people have always hated us. They just used to do it with a smile on their face. Okay. Where's the rest? - That's what he gave me. - Did you count it? I'm just supposed to count it, right there? I don't give a fuck where you count it, you always count it! Okay. (dramatic music) (sparking) Okay, the guy over there's the guy who shorted you. I don't fuck with Electrics, so you be ready. How do you wanna live in this life? Do what they want us to do, live by their rules, hide our powers, fuck that. You are and always will be a class five Electric. Mikey! I want my money. Things have changed, man. The Trust came to me directly, and they told me you guys are dead. This is my territory now, so why don't you get the fuck... Get the fuck off. (zaps) (explosive zap) Be who you are. And if you see something that you want, take it. (humming) Mary's not working tonight, so, if you'll excuse... Keep focused. Hold it, Connor. Surge! - (yelling) - (explosive electricity) (panting) Hey. You okay? MARY: Yeah. You know that interview I went for? Yeah. They called me back. And? You got the job? I got the job. MARY: You got the job! (laughs) If it goes well, you know, maybe we can get you in to see someone. Okay, okay. See? Things will work out. I know. PARK: This one's a class five. 26, no record, still living at home. No job, knee deep in medical bills. DAVIS: What are you thinking? Life hits you hard enough, you're gonna start hitting back. Seems to me that certain people do. PARK: Pin his face to the wall. (tense music) TELLER: I can take you here. Thank you. Emily, that's a lovely name. What can I do for you today? Tell them what you saw. CONNOR: Two guards watching our every move, with SMGs, cameras in every corner. And the vault's being controlled somewhere outside the bank. It's a two part lock. First part is combination, second part is someone offsite verifying who gets in. They control the power to the door, but you can short it with a surge. And trigger the alarm. Drone's best time is seven minutes? We're out of there in five. (dramatic music) Hey. I'm all done in aisle three, do you want me to start loading in from the back? No, I'll get someone else to do that. But, there is nobody else. Look, I don't want any problems, okay? I'll do it. Now, on cash advances, your rate of 19.99% becomes effective immediately. MADDY: A lot of people seen inside. GARRETT: Nothing we can't handle. Let's go. - (gunfire) - (electricity) - (grunting) - (indistinct talking) FEMALE: You're okay. GARRETT: Everybody on the ground! Right fucking now! - (squealing) - If you move, we hurt you. Get to work. (intense music) Get the fuck down! (whimpering) (electricity) - (Connor yells) - (explosive electricity) (alarm blaring) GARRETT: We know who you are, we know where you live. - (alarm continues) - Don't fuck around. TOWER: We got an alarm at Lincoln Dominion Bank in zone seven. Possible robbery in progress. PILOT: Copy. D-1-1-2 is four minutes out. (alarm continues) GARRETT: This is not the time to get forgetful, let's go! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. CONNOR: It's okay, it's okay. Okay, you're okay, deep breaths. All right? Deep breaths. One number at a time. Then you get to go home. (tense music) (alarm continues) (locks into place) GARRETT: Get on the ground, don't move. (dramatic music) What the fuck? CONNOR: What? GARRETT: Start packing. Get up! (teller gasps) Where's the rest? Rest of what? GARRETT: The 500 thousand dollars that's supposed to be in your fucking vault! They cleared the vault before the weekend. GARRETT: When! Four o'clock today. (alarm continues) Fuck! TOWER: Confirmed robbery in progress. All units in zone seven to Lincoln Dominion Bank, code eight. PILOT: 20 seconds to target. GARRETT: Fucking... MADDY: Hey! We gotta go. (tense music) GARRETT: Fuck! CONNOR: We gotta go, shit. GARRETT: Back door. Keep your fucking heads down. CONNOR: It's over. Where'd all the goddamn money go? (propellers) ANNOUNCER: This is the police! Stop where you are and do not move. Get down on the ground with your hands behind your head. If you do not... - Connor, do it. - We'll be shot. What? Remote surge. ANNOUNCER: Get down now, this is your final warning. Do it right now, or we're fucked. MEGAPHONE: If you do not comply you will be shot. - Guardian's ready. - What's he doing? PILOT: He's gonna hit the drone FEMALE: Deploy, now! GARRETT: Do it! - (Connor yells) - (explosive electricity) PILOT: Losing control, engine one is down. Losing engine three... (dramatic noise) Two is going down, I repeat, two is going down. (crashing) Drone down, drone town! TOWER: Drone down. - All my controls... - EMP fired at... MALE: Anyone else hearing this? FEMALE: All units to Lincoln Dominion Bank. FEMALE: Suspect is a high level Electric. MALE: We're 50 kilometers out. (multiple indistinct radio calls) Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! (tense music) Where's the rest? The vault was cleared out. MARCUS: What the fuck do you mean? That's only 50 thousand dollars. Those pick up times are on you to know. Now how the fuck do we pay back the Trust? This is 10% of what we wanted. Okay, so the job's a bust. Boo fucking hoo. You cleared the fucking job! Tone it down, boy. Tread very carefully, Garrett. (smack) What the hell! Get the fuck away from me. Fucking piece of shit, get out! (indistinct yelling) (dramatic music) Use your fucking head, figure out a way to fill this out! Gun. Gun! - (gunfire) - (crying out) - (yells) - (electricity) - (grunts) - (slashes) (gunshot) (dramatic music) (gunshot) - (gunshot) - (gunshot) (clattering) (thuds) Make sure it's done cleanly. Talk like that again, it'll be you going in that van. Get your hand off me. Look, I know where these guys are. We gotta move on them before they hit us again. It's a fucking easy target, I can hit it tonight. Oh, Garrett, you don't seem to get how fucked we are, do you? You don't go to war with The Trust. We can't take this lying down. We're gonna lost our entire business. It's my business! Go do what I say. (distorted music) Nia. Nia. You okay? Yeah. That was fucking insane. Wasn't the first time I've had a gun on me. Going after Marcus I get. Why go after his girl? I'm not his girl. Not like that. That's not what I mean, I just... Give me your arm. I'm fine, it was nothing. What are you doing? Trust me. (dramatic music) CONNOR: Oh, my God. (high frequency noise) You're a Healer. That's why they went after me. Why do you heal him? I have my reasons. For Psyke? It's not just that. I'm paying off a debt. Hey. He wants to go. NIA: Don't touch me. Fucking junkie. (lock clicks) Connor? Where'd you get this? It's overtime at work. Don't lie to me! I called over there, and they'd never even heard of you. We need the money. After everything I've taught you, how could you be so stupid? Mom, I tried it your way, it doesn't work, okay? They're not giving us a chance out there. You sound just like your father. So what, at least he did something. Hey, at least he was trying, what do you expect me to do? You are running out of time, okay, look at you. I'm not just gonna sit around and watch you die. (distorted music) (ice crackling) (shatters) Mom, Mom, no, no. Mom. Come on, come on, come on. Mom, please! It's spreading faster than we thought. The tumor's pressing her brain up against the skull. That's what's causing her to lose control of her abilities. Frankly it's good that she's here. She could've been very dangerous in public. And it's treatable? Well, her condition's been neglected for too long. If we're gonna beat this, we need to operate right away. I'll leave you to think about it. Here's the total for the surgery. It doesn't include the recovery room, which is seven thousand for the week. And the anesthesia's only covered up to first five thousand dollars. Once we get the down payment, we can move her into pre-op. If you require a loan, you'll need to -. Connor Reed. I'm Officer Park and this is Officer Davis. Got a minute? No. Can't say you come from great stock, Connor. Your old man wasn't exactly a model citizen. Chemical plant up on East Fifth. Lincoln Dominion Bank. You know anything about these robberies? No. Word has it you're running with Garrett Kelton. He's got a rap sheet roughly the size of my dick. So, short and thin? Garrett Kelton happens to be working for the biggest piece of shit in Lincoln City. DAVIS: You ever hear of Marcus Sutcliffe? PARK: We burn more of his Psyke than any other dealer in LC. DAVIS: How much we lighting up next week? PARK: Four million dollars. Just a matter of time before that asshole goes down. Mm-hmm, and everybody who works for him. Look, Connor. We know about your mom. I know she's sick. You know you got mixed up with some bad people. I'd do the same for my family. But you gotta give me something on Sutcliffe. I can help you. Do you wanna spend your Mom's last days taking it in the ass from every Brawn in the pen? Don't talk about my mom. Ooh, you hear that, Park? I think he got real attached to her ever since we put his daddy on his back. PARK: Davis. There he is, come on, do something tough guy, because I would love nothing more than to bury you next to your failure of a father. Davis. I'd double-check that footage. You got the wrong guy. DAVIS: All right, let's do it, let's get back in there, I'm gonna give him the slip. I think we let him go. What? Sorry, it sounded like you said let him go. We gave him our offer. Yeah, he spit it back in our face! All we have is a class five with shaky surveillance. DA won't touch it. Then, we go to his house, and we make sure that we find a whole bunch of Psyke, and we get this done. You cross that line, Davis, there's no coming back. Look, man. I get you wanna cut deals and turn informants and build a case, I'm all for that, but don't forget for one second how dangerous these people can be. She's blinding you. What did you say in there? We need to see Marcus. Nah, you don't get to walk out of a cop shop and ask for a meeting. I didn't say shit. You don't believe me, I'll see him myself. About what? A job. (cartoon music) (giggling) Ah. Look who it is. Don't blink. (distorted whispering) Kid's the real deal. Kept his mouth shut. How much pure did the cops pull off you last month? Four sleeves. Four sleeves off you, three sleeves off the East Side, two off the South? We take nine sleeves, we step it down, what's that worth on the street? 10 million? 10 million dollars. And in three days, these motherfuckers are gonna incinerate it. You're gonna hit the Psyke run. You get the Psyke, I get her. Oh. That's sweet. Someone has a poor dying Mommy. We got a deal? Yeah, we got a deal. Don't worry, I'll get her to behave. Um. One more thing. What's that? We're partners. (chuckles) 50/50. Do you remember when I first found you? You were eating out of a dumpster like a little stray dog. Do you remember that, Garrett? How I took you in, I cleaned you up, and I gave you all the things you didn't have? I'm grateful. But let me explain something. There's too much territory, and there's too much product, to lay it all at the feet of one person. We work this together. We pay off the Trust, then you and me, we won't be answering to anyone. You and me. You and me. Okay, Garrett. You have a deal. You earned it. Yeah. (contemplative music) (distant siren) No fly zone starts right there, Main and 5th. Then that's where we should go. This whole thing's going down right in the middle of Lincoln City. Because of the towers, drones are restricted from downtown. That means we do this quietly. The longer it stays that way, the longer we have, so nobody pop off. Truck comes down this street. We can't do it here, way too many cameras. Main Street's gonna be worse. What if we send it down there? When it's at the cutoff, we're gonna put Connor in the alley. We secure the area. Anyone calls in an attack, restrictions get lifted, and they'll be on us in seconds. We take down the Guardians and we round up the cops. Okay, we tie them up, we get the Psyke, we get out, we don't kill anyone. It's different this time, Connor. CONNOR: It doesn't matter. Nobody has to die. This truck has four Guardians on it. It has 10 times the surge protection of a drone. Only way that we make it work is if we get you close, you have one shot. You hit it, and we have the window. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know he's classified, but he's still only one Electric. What's the plan if the fucking kid misses? I won't. He won't. Guess we're gonna see how badly he wants to save his mom. (dramatic music) (muffled speech) Shit, don't fucking touch me! Back in a sec. Hey, can we talk? (scoffs) Wait, wait wait. Nia. You heal my mom, you can go. I'm not bringing you back here. The only reason I matter to you is because I'm a Healer. That's all anyone gives a fuck about once they see what I can do. Don't act like you're any different. (dramatic music) (traffic noise) (muffled police radio) Looking good in those cuffs, Mikey. MIKEY: That's what your wife said last night. Probably. Clear. TOWER: Escort drone in position, go when ready. They're on the move. PILOT: L to 1-1-8 and 1-0-9 in zone two, heading northbound on Main. TOWER: Copy, we see you. (ticking clock) PILOT: Escort is half a click to zone one. TOWER: No fly in effect, do not enter. PILOT: Copy that. MADDY: 30 seconds. PILOT: C-1-5, now entering zone one. TOWER: C-1-5 has entered the no fly zone. Escort drones, move to zone three for pickup. PILOT: Copy. See you boys on the other side. TOWER: Drones are off escort. C-1-5, you're solo 'til zone three. They're in the no fly. All right. Nobody moves until Conner fries the truck. Ah, fuck, construction. Hang a left on 3rd, we'll go up Liberty. TOWER: 1-5, why did you turn? COP: We hit a roadblock. We're now east bound on 3rd street. PILOT: Copy that. MADDY: They're coming to you. (crackling) COP: Whoa, whoa, what the hell. - (brakes squeal) - (crashing) Unbelievable. TOWER: 1-5, why have you stopped? Some idiot's blocked the road. Move your ass! Come on! PILOT: The D-1-1-8 has arrived in zone three. Stand by for escort. COP: Move your vehicle immediately! Hang on, one minute please! COP: Clear off the road. Yep! Come on, come on, come on. COP: Clear the road, or you will be detained. Move, now. Fuck's he doing? This is your last warning! (dramatic music) MADDY: What the fuck is he waiting for? - Guys... - Your vehicle. GARRETT: All right. COP: You don't move or you will be shot. No no, no, hang on. COP: You're being detained. (electricity builds) - (yells) - (explosive electricity) (clattering) Code eight, I repeat, code eight. TOWER: 1-5 just went dark, someone get over there! PILOT: D-1-1-8, requesting clearance of zone one. TOWER: I need ground units in zone one. Connor! (grunts) (brakes squeal) (clattering) (sizzling) (tense music) PILOT: 1-1-8 is requesting clearance. TOWER: Stand by 1-1-8, no fly is still in effect. How long on those ground units? 1-5 under attack, 1-5 under attack, do you copy? They're burning a hole! (dramatic music) They're coming in, get ready! (hissing) (coughing) MALE: Fucking move it! (indistinct yelling) (dramatic music) PILOT: Fuck this. 1-1-8 is entering zone one, path cleared to target. TOWER: 1-1-8 is into the no fly (coughing) (tense music) You got what you wanted, okay? Just let us go, yeah? Stay by the car. I just wanna see my family again, okay? - I just wanna see my family... - (gunshot) (gunshots) Maddy! (gunshot) (distorted sound) (gunfire) (rapid gunfire) PILOT: This is the LCPD, drop your weapons immediately. TOWER: Deploying Guardians. (thuds) GARRETT: Go, come on, come on! (rapid gunfire) (distorted music) (gunfire) PILOT: Four officers down, I need medical! TOWER: All units, looking for three powered suspects on foot between 3rd and 2nd Street. Shit. Get in the car, get in the fucking car. (somber music) Okay, come on. PILOT: 1-0-6 is southbound on 2nd Street, no sign of suspects. Garrett, where am I going? Hey, hey, look at me, look at me, you're gonna be okay, just hold on. He needs a hospital, man. I fucking know that he needs a hospital. (gasping) You gotta go to the hospital. You are gonna bleed out. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! (sirens blaring) (smacking) Oh! Oh, it's so thick, look at that. Where are the others? Mm. I have a present for you. Like it? Hm? Yeah? Your daddy still owes me a lot of money, but maybe I should just have someone cut him open and we'll call it even. Start cutting that out. (somber music) (vomiting) What the fuck just happened? - Fuck! - (electricity) Marcus fucked us. No. No, you fucked us. That's bullshit. This was your plan, do not fucking put this on me. The plan was fine until you got greedy. He fucking played you, Garrett. Now we have nothing. Where you going? I've been tracking this one Electric across multiple crimes, he's the only one who's powerful enough and desperate enough to pull something like this off. Reed is just the pawn. CAPTAIN: What makes you so sure? We interviewed him. He's not a killer. You had this Electric in custody? Why didn't you charge him? Because what you know and what you can prove are two different things, sir, so I let him go. And then what happened? Look at the fucking board. That enough evidence for you? None of this gets out. This goes south and it's your heads on the block, I will make goddamn sure of that. Now find the bastards that did this. Where's that line of yours now? (somber music) (gasps) CONNOR: Hi. Hi. Mom, I'm so sorry. Where were you? I... I was just figuring some things out. You're gonna be okay, okay, I can fix this. Connor. You have to stop. No. No, there is a way, okay? You just need to trust me. You need to let me go. I can't do that. (sighs) (sobbing quietly) RADIO: Women in uniform. So when we talk about imposing a complete power ban, we're talking about a public safety issue. WOMAN: How will that stop criminals from using them? They don't care about the law. A ban affects innocent people with power, that's it. MAN: Fact is... (knocks) Lina, your father's here. LINA: Coming! She was a real handful today. Stuff falling off the walls and the counter. The kids at school are scared of her. LINA: Hi, Dad! Hey, sweetie. We'll talk about this later, okay? How's the cotton candy? What's wrong, sweetie? Are you and mom gonna give me away? What makes you think that? I know some parents do that when their kid is like me. PARK: Who told you that? I heard it on the news. Hey! You Officer Park? Please, just take it. LINA: Daddy, who was that? He's just a friend, sweetie, come on.

(jet engine) TOWER: Surveillance drones in zone 11 cleared to 500 feet. PILOT: 1-0-9 are in position. We have eyes on location. Multiple bogies spotted by the entrance. CAPTAIN: D-1-0-9, punch in. PILOT: Psyke runners have been going in and out all day, no sign of Sutcliffe yet. Call it in! Better be right about this. (muffled shouting) MAN: Let's get these fucks! PILOT: 1-0-8 to tower two, taking off. TOWER: Tower two, you're clear. 1-0-8's in the sky, ground units on the move. (coughing) Nia, come here. (coughing) Nia! (coughing) Do it. (coughing) Do it.

I'm sorry for what I did to you. What about you? I'm... I'm just gonna go in there, see how to make things right. (cheering, chanting) For the first time, City Hall will vote on an outright power ban in Lincoln City. Proponents have pushed through the bill since four officers were killed five weeks ago while transporting Psyke. (applause) Smile, Park. Thanks to these brave officers, who tirelessly put in good, honest police work, our streets are cleaner and safer than they've ever been. (applause) (gentle instrumental music) That's double what Marcus owed. The Trust appreciates your generosity. There's still business to be done. The cops are leaning on us now, but demand for Psyke is higher than ever. Hmm. I'll find out if they're interested. Okay. (chirping) Hey, Mom.
