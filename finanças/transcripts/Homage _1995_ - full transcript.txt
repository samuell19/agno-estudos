You can't have him. I don't him. He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with. But all I wanted was the love to stay. Well, you get stuck with the wrong fella, there's only thing that you can do, pull the ground right up over you. You've made the right choice. Here now are Raymond Mesa and weather with Jim Gamble. Good evening. Welcome to News Channel 9. I'm Raymond Mesa. She was New Mexico's brightest star. Now her light has dimmed. The pride of Las Cruces, Lucy Samuel, who costarred as Little Mama Mary on the hit television series "Banyon's Brood" was gunned down today at the home of her widowed mother. The television star was 24. Good evening, everybody. Welcome to "Entertainment Tonight." Tonight's top story is the death of television star Lucille Samuel. Entertainment Tonight interviewed Lucy back in 1991 when she was nominated for an Emmy. The absolute best is the confirmation, finally, that I have talent. Not to have to doubt myself anymore. At least for the next several hours. After a brief stint in the short lived series "The Poorhouse," Lucy grabbed the lead role in the low budget cult film "Race Girl," and then was cast in the top rated television series "Banyon's Brood." Two years ago she got her Emmy nomination for the TV movie "Death of My Sister." We are gathered here today to remember and honor our Lucy. Lucy is brought larger to us than ever she thought she should be. As the poet once said, "Underneath the growing grass, underneath the living flowers, deeper than the sound of showers." I buried her out on the mesa beside her father. It seemed like half the folks in town gathered like so many worshipers, as if she, the people on her show, the other Hollywood people who arrived for the funeral, as if they were some religion unto themselves. Katherine. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost. When she was a little girl, my daughter used to ask me, momma, to tell me how you felt when I was born. And I would say, Lucy, I believed with all my heart that no child had been more welcome or would be more loved. And when she was born, my... my brother sent her this telegram. It says, welcome to the world Lucille Ann, homage will follow in due course. Let me pose this conundrum, Gibby. You kill someone. You end someone's life. Do you continue writing the movie script you were writing to star that person who through your action is no longer here? I'm trying to study, Landrum. You don't really suppose, deputy, that when you sit there hunched over that law book that I actually believe you're reading it? Goon Lips. Don't call me Goon Lips. Well, then don't call me Landrum, Goon Lips. Book, read, study, Landrum. You mentioned study, Goon Lips. Has word reached you yet about this no nonsense sociological study, that claims that 8 out of 10 of you Americans of Mexican descent have given up any appreciable aspirations of upward mobility by the time you turn 20? That you gained an average of 25 pounds in malt and hops before you turn 21? That your high school sweetheart lured you by way of your utterly brainless, uncircumcised prick with her sacred virginity into marriage? That you had a kid inside 11 months? That you committed an affair inside two years with a brown skinned girl very much like your spouse before you imprisoned her in that disgusting little fella of a trailer with a kid where she got as fat and as stupid as you, Fica Puto? Shh. Then carry on a normal conversation with me. No. In my own opinion, Mrs. Samuel was starting to lose it a couple of months before Lucy was killed. We got a call there was gunfire coming from her place. She'd set up a bottle, you know, and unloaded on it. The bottle survived intact, but the place was a mess. The entire property, fields of pecan orchards. About then she put an ad in the paper and a guy showed up on a bicycle, Archie. Come on, Mrs. Samuel. The ad says a small farm, private quarters, decent hours, hard worker. It doesn't in any way exclude someone who has a PhD in mathematics. No, but it probably should have. You have my references. Three summers while other grad students were out trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, I was wrestling with whether it was better to plant yellow granos or conquistador. Now tell me, have you tried conquistador? I never heard of it. You will, next year. I can get it for you. Look, a young man of your education would... I understand your concerns. See, I am simply not prepared to embark upon my adult career at this time. Look at this place. We have needs to which we can't always give names. I think I took him on because I sensed he was as lonely as I. Why would she hire him? If you want protection or somebody to take care of your place, you really going to hire a mathematician? Look, I'll go get myself a pair of overalls, the kind with the bid and that thing you stick your hammer in, and you know the colorful bandana in the back pocket. Huh? We'll give it a try. Well, the boy confesses before his attorney even arrives. I mean, when you pass the loafered guys down from Dallas imported by the kid's parents. And... uh... when I hear that the kid dumps the tassle loafered guy, I'm thinking to myself, this a smart boy. I mean, don't prejudice you down home jury with somebody that they're going to resent. Make yourself the underdog. Get somebody that the DA doesn't consider any competition, somebody like the public defender of the county. That's how got to meet him. Joseph Smith. I wanted someone named Stubbs Kikendal or R Panther Maryweather, something... something that inspires confidence. Dr. Landrum, there there's no need to convince me you're crazy as our only recourse here is not guilty by reason of insanity. Why did you kill Lucille Samuel? It's all right there on the confession. Nice suit. Tell me, is that the real polyester or just an expensive imitation? It's a real polyester. Dr. Landrum, you're going to have to cooperate with me here if you want me to help you. Well not to become mired in the convolutions of the lingo, Mr. Smith, but what exactly do you mean by help me? I mean, I'm going to endeavor to convince the jury to spare you the death penalty, Doctor. Well, with those road map eyes and that Rudolph nose, I can only assume that you came here directly from a cocktail lounge. From and on my way back too. Gilbert. Smithy, I don't want out of here. You see, there are lunatics out there that think that television stars are people of enormous consequence in our society. At least in here, I am with someone I can trust. Listen, Sonny Boy, if you're some head case that wants the death penalty, you've saddled the wrong pony. I dreamed about this case my whole life. Hey. Hi. Where you been? Groceries. For three hours? Well, I... sat around with my husband for a while. Well, I took our soil sample into the university this morning. And I had a hunch we were nitrogen poor. And I was right. I had no idea. Oh, well, don't worry. It's nothing reversible. I'll balance your soil. Well, no one's ever offered to do that for me before. Oh, I see, you're joking. That's nice. So are you going to eat that little bovine when she grows up? Ha, not likely. My husband always said, we must try not to devour what we love. May I ask, how did he die, your husband? Ice cream. He jogged through all seasons, old illnesses. He played full court basketball a week before he died. But he couldn't stop eating ice cream. Arteries got so full of dairy fat, they finally revolted. Well, we all make choices, don't we, Mrs. Samuel? Yeah, we sure do. "Riverrun, past Eve and Adam's." That's why we built here. That line popped into my head and it wouldn't go away. The opening line of James Joyce's "Ulysses," I believe. Oh, no, "Finnegan's Wake." I really don't think so, Mrs. Samuel. Believe me, it's "Finnegan's Wake." Who did you say last night knows everything. I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I want to be right. But on the other hand, I don't want you to ever be wrong. Well, you probably read both books all the way through. Well actually, I have lied about this book all my life. Oh? Yeah I made it about 3/4 through "Ulysses." Maybe the first 100 and last 10 pages of "Finnegan's Wake." How about you? Cliff Notes. We are confessing things to each other we should not confess. I know. Am I mistaken or is that Lucille Samuel? Yep. Duh. Katherine Samuel, Lucille Samuel. Come on, eat. Oh, hey, Mrs. S. Chorizo and eggs, I mean, you read a guy's mind. This is the perfect farm hand breakfast. Would it be out of place for me to tell you that I think your daughter's television series, while vastly entertaining, also maintains an important overview of late 20th century? Oh, come on, you're not serious. "Banyon's Brood," a detective and a hooker living out of wedlock with four disgustingly adorable street urchins who weekly solve various catastrophes in an hour. Come on, Mrs. S, you have to look at these TV shows as microcosmic. I mean not as literal representations of reality. It's Dickens gone rotten. If it didn't force itself upon us, we'd probably vote reality right out of existence. It's the most simplistic piece of crap I've ever seen in my life. Rebuttal? No, I don't think so. My brain is tired. It isn't used to being challenged anymore. May not really like it anymore. No offense. Hi. No one's home, but please leave a message. Catherine? Hi. Pick up. Catherine? Mother, are you hiding from me? Am I being screened? We go on hiatus next week. I want to come home and sleep in my room with a widdle bitty puppy doggie on the end of my bed. No dogs left, Luce. Got a cow and cast all. Your bed might get a little crowded. But I can come home, right? Can I? I can, right? Of course you can come home, Lucy. I should tell you that I have a boarder. A what? My caretaker got sick. Had to quit. I hired someone else. Someone who lives here. I didn't know if you liked chocolates or flowers. I went back and forth, chocolates, flowers, flowers, chocolates, chocolate, flowers. Finally, trapped in boyish indecision, I opted for an orange. Please, take it. I... I brought it for you. You must be Archie. Yes. Thank you very much. It's very sweet of you. Oh, no, no, anything but sweet. Please, it's intended to seem slightly eccentric, unthreateningly clever, but not sweet. Anything but sweet. I saw you out there on that tractor. You really drive that baby. Oh, thank you. I've often said, if there were a sporting event involving large farm vehicles, I'd be all pro. What are you planting? Mostly cruciferous vegetables, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, the ever popular Brussels sprouts. On a more serious note, however, I thought that I would... well, I thought I would invite you to dinner one evening. Oh, please, Miss Samuel, give an eligible guy a break. It's no big deal. Yeah, but, you see, the thing is, Archie, I really want to spend my time here as unsocially as I can. Sure. Sure. Yes, I'm sure that the unrelenting presence of human beings in public life can make a little privacy quite welcome. Thanks for understanding. Sure. Perhaps a Campari and soda one afternoon. Archie. Good guy, Archie. Well, somewhat more than that I think. It's 1:00 in the afternoon, why are you drinking? Lunchtime in LA, Katherine. So what are your plans today? Can we... what/ I want... I want to do something I remember loving to do when I loved doing things. Would it be fair to ask you not to go around just like? You created the concept, Katherine. You used to go braless everywhere. One of the numerous errors in judgment I since tried to rectify, Lucille. I own exactly one bra, Katherine. It's in LA. I could strap my boobs with an ACE bandage. Oh, momma, I swore I wasn't going to... let's... let's have one of those fabulous cathartic conversations that parents and children always have right before the final commercial message. When you're sober, Lucille, maybe we can take a whack at it. Look, you cannot file a not guilty by reason of insanity plea unless four, count them, four psychologists or psychiatrists evaluate you. You can't just stop after one. I am simply inquiring what they anticipate finding with all this simplistic roaming around my psyche. They're going to find out you're out of your frigging mind, Arch, or else your ass is grass. Questions. I mean, did you hear that one they asked me, Goon Lips? You find a bag of money on ground stenciled on in big letters, "This belongs to a well known child molester," what do you do? Well, when you're inside, I'd strap it to a hand grenade and shove it live in the regulator. Gilbert. You hear the way my only friend talks to me? And it's Doctor to you Gibby. If going to call me Mister, call me Doctor. Mm, mm, mm, now doesn't that look tasty? Ah, red stuff. You going to help us out here, Archie? All those leading questions about mom and pop. There just should be a law that two dumpy people like my parents who never desired anybody but each other should be banned from reproducing the species. That's all. I think this red stuff is camouflaged greens stuff from the other night. Hey, guess you called me today. "People" freaking magazine. They're going to come down here and cover us. Hey? Great. You and me, Smitty, the last two human beings on the face of the Earth who haven't been profiled in "People" magazine. Now if there's nothing else, I'd like to eat without the smell of sour grapes on your breath. New shrink tomorrow, Arch. Mix them up good. Smitty, why don't you just tell me what kind of diagnosis you want these nitwits to come in with. I want you to be more complicated than their combined abilities to define you. No problem. I want you to stop looking at me like you were looking at me in there. How I was looking at you, Mr. Smith? When you become a lawyer, if you become a lawyer, and you've been in practice for 10 years or more and your ideals are still intact, then you can look at me like that. But right now, piss ant, stop it. My problems are not, repeat, not linked to drugs, mother. I've been clean for four months. How can you be clean and drink? Hey, one drug at a time, OK? Doesn't that make sense? - Nope. Sounds like horseshit. Well, that's tough, because I know what's going on inside of me. My therapist thinks my problems may be linked at least tangentially to diet. What are you eating? Not now, when I was a kid. Oh, when you were a kid and lived with your dad and me. The implication being that your problems had nothing to do with years of drug abuse and our my fault as I was the dietitian of your youth. Excuse me, Lucy, try a spoonful of this. No, thank you, Archie. He's not passing judgment. He's only trying to make a clinical analysis of my depression. Pardon me, Lucy, if I may. You're beautiful. You're... you're famous. You have a dream career. I don't understand what you have to be depressed about. Uh... excuse me, Archie, but who invited you into this conversation? Hey, come on, now. He lives here. He has a PhD in mathematics and he makes soup. Mrs. Samuel, try. It's zucchini with asparagus and a cream sherry based. It's really wonderful. Come on, try. Jesus, Katherine, how can you just dismiss my concerns? If I was one of your students, you would take me seriously. You were one of my students, Lucy. And I took you damn seriously until you dropped out of school to go away so you could come back once a year like this. God, it's good to be home. When Lucy gave up on college, I gave up on teaching because I could no longer tolerate the sound of other human beings, with their caterwauling, self-pitying, self-righteous, self-absorbed screechings. I craved lack of communication, silence. And then Walter died. And it has been a real damn silent since. Come on. Come on. OK, everybody, here we go. Dr. Landrum's famous oat bran and raisin cookies. Mrs. S, try one. Come on, Lucy. Good? Good. Now, Mrs. S, if I may, I just don't think it's fair of you to ignore your daughter's problems just because she happens to be a famous television star and ought to being happy. I have an idea. Let's change the subject. Raise of hands. I know, how about a game. Come on. Come on, Lucy. Here's what we'll do. We'll play all time great first moments. OK? Come on, Mrs. S. Name the first moment that comes to mind when you were truly jumped up, tap dance and yell yahoo happy. Come on. Come on. Come on, Lucy. Fine, I got dishes to do. Reading "Wuthering Heights" for the first time. Really? Archie? Oh, seeing "Close Encounters" first time, of course. Lucy. Come on. Um... taking second all the first time. Good. Mrs. S? Fun game, Archie. Tell me something, Lucy. Why do you continue doing this to each other? We must like it. I thought you'd be happy that I'm trying to clean myself up. I want to be, Lucy. But for years I've been guilty of more than I could have possibly done to you. Why did you come home, Lucy? What is it you want from me? Obviously, what you don't have to give. Then for God's sake stop asking for it. I don't mom anymore. I'm don't wife. I don't teach. Well, what exactly do you do? Fuck if I know. Fester. If I go, Katherine, if I leave, I am never, ever, ever coming back here. My husband died. I lost my daughter when I drove her away years ago. I don't know, Lucy. I don't know. I'm going for a ride. I first met her when she was protesting the bomb about 100 years ago when I was right out of law school and still in pursuit of my rightful immortality. Thank you. Kay and Walter Samuel sat down on the road to the missile range one day and then hired me to utilize the law of the land to make it look like what they did wasn't what it was, which is to say a crime. And I managed to do that because I was still young enough to believe in justice and, B, Kay Samuel was so... and the night I set them free, in the front seat of my little sports car, I took her tongue into my throat. And given the choice right, I would have kept it there forever. Her eyes are like fire stones that glow in the dark. I see them in the sky above and know it must be true. Exterior mountains, night, the moon. Rafe and Megan nude at waterside sharing a quince. Rafe spits on Megan's denuded breast. Maladroit. I'm maladroit? You look like one of the inhabitants of Galaxy 16. I want to tell you something, Mr. Landrum. You're right, right. I do have a wife. Of course, you do, your high school sweetheart, Gabriela Margarita, Rotundo. Yeah, and she was my high school sweetheart. Is there an echo in here? Hello. Hello. - She's 26 now. She weighs 108 pounds, same she weighed when we got married. There's something for Ripley's. We got two kids. On your way to a baker's dozen. No, no more. We finished. Ooh, the old Catholic church will have something to say about that, now won't it, Lips? We've been married eight years. And I haven't had another woman since we got married. And I don't intend to. Something funny? You're dreaming, Goon Lips. You call me Goon Lips one more time, and I'm going to find a way to do some serious damage to you. Take your hands off me. What? Take your hands off me who? Take your hands off me, Goon Lips. Regards to Broadway. Off Broadway, Off Broadway. where Momma and Dada were there. Mother was so thrilled. So proud of you, Darling. And Mother? Zee mommy? Smiling. Schmiling? Nee, only schmiling? Only schmiling. I was very proud of you, Lucy. Gee, where have I had that before? Hey, hey, those scripts you've been reading, have you... have you... have you found a good one yet? Oh, the scripts, the same old crap. The esteemed star of our show is making a movie in Budapest with an Academy Award winning director that opens a career for him in features. That's the end of the show. Bye, bye, stardom Oh, no. She was so proud of me that night. How come she made me feel just ever so extremely adequate? Interesting play, Lucy and nice performance. Well, let's ask her. Mrs. S, if you were so proud of her... That's not what I said, Lucy, or the way in which I said whatever it is I did say. I just want you to become another uneducated American icon. You never thought I'd make it. No, Lucy, I was the one who from infancy practically pushed you on stage. You were jealous of me. Yes. Jesus, in some ways, and even now. I'm going for a wee stroll under the stars. Not long before he died, Walter told me it wasn't fair of me to disapprove of Lucy because she had grown up to become someone I envied when I told him righteously that she would have to become much, much more in order to become someone I would aspire to be. Hey, I passed by this afternoon, and you seem mesmerized by a script that I couldn't help noticing was called "The Journey to Galaxy 16." How was it? Was it the one you've been looking for? Oh, Jesus, one of your quasi intellectual, intergalactic, sadomasochistic tales where I'd have to spend a great deal of time as a naked hostage. Quasi what? Not exactly the image I'm supposed to maintain for my show. Oh, I see. So the fact that your first movie you took your clothes off, that is not conflict with the image you have to maintain for your show? Oh, I see, we're cinema history buff along with our other interests. That was a long time ago, Archie. Hey, a vast amount of history is a long time ago. But that doesn't erase one moment of it. OK, OK, maybe you didn't understand the symbology behind "The Journey to Galaxy 16." Maybe the infinity concept confused you. That... that... that's a good point. Good. I can simplify that aspect of a. Good, fine. Thank you, simplify infinity. What else? You wrote that script? It just occurred to me how badly you needed a career changing film. And what with the proclivity of love stories abounding in the film industry and the ongoing fascination with outer space, I just thought... Archie, Archie, what I'm looking for is... I want to make people laugh. I want to find a romantic, literate comedy. Comedy? Lucy, I've seen that show you're on. Let me remind you, you have all the humor of tree bark. Hey, you know, that really stinks, mister. I've been really nice to you. Yes. Yes, you have. I'm sorry. I... I just... oh, sweetheart. Lucy. The fact is when Archie answered that ad, he had no idea you understand that it had been placed by the mother of Lucille Samuel. Of course, he had heard of her, the girl that grew up around here and quit the college to run off and get famous. And, of course, he had heard of the early movie that Lucy was in where she appeared in the nude. And in the way that young men sometimes do, Archie started to dream of her, of this famous, local naked person. I mean, we all dreamed of her. But Archie sort of got carried away in his dreams. Morning, Lucille. What did you do with my wine, Mother? All gone. I shipped two cases of very grape here, Katherine, and I had an open bottle. Where is it? Hall closet. Ah, Lucy, I was wondering now that you've had 14, 15 hours of sleep, maybe we could talk about my screenplay. I'm observing a day of silence, OK, Archie. I didn't know you were a writer, Archie. Oh, I dabble. Well, actually you'd love it. As a binding metaphor, I'm using Plato's principle of plentitude, which is... Lucy? Lucy, Lucy, what am I supposed to do for human intercourse if you talk to me? - Intercourse with my mother. Just let me ask you one more question. Just answer me and then I'll go shovel manure. Is gorgeous everything? I mean... I mean is that the crux of our non-relationship? Because if it is, what are us non-gorgeous cerebral types supposed to do for mates? You're not an unattractive man, Archie. Oh, thanks, I feel great now. But just because you're intriguing and because we happen to be in the same geographic area does not obligate me to make myself available to you, now does it, Archie, seriously? Just a passing observation, Lucy. But I bet a lot of your fans will be more than a little disgusted to know that your pluck your pubic hairs and that you have those little red follicular infections high up there on your inner thigh. You know, Archie, a remark like that, a lot of women would consider that crass. But frankly, it just moistness me. Hey, I just don't think it would kill you to wear some shorts that adequately cover your crotch. It just lubes me up. Archie, you find an addressed and stamped envelope open on the ground. What do you do? If I found a letter open on the ground, Dr. Sachs, I'd read it, correct the spelling, punctuation, maybe clarify the content if it seemed to warrant that kind of attention, reseal it, and send it on. Am I right or wrong about that, Gibby? Got up early this morning, got a lot of chores to do today. Going to clean off them screen, going them make nice and clean. There's Mrs. Samuel... hi, ma'am... looking mighty pretty, planting some flowers because she's got a lot of power. Oh, God, Lucy, I'm sorry. I'm just cleaning the screens. I didn't know you were in there. Well, would you mind turning away? What? You have the screen. Would you mind getting the hell out of my bathroom now. Yes. No. Yes. I'm sorry. OK. He was looking in the window. He's over there. Well, people can move from one place to another, mother. There's this technique called running. I've asked you not to go around dressed like that. Don't, Katherine. I am doing the best I can with the equipment available. Watch the onions. The screens have to be cleaned periodically. Is that true or false, Mrs. Samuel? - True. - So... However? The window in question happens to be within the purview of my employment at the moment my eyes happened to glimpse the celebrity Lucille Samuel taking a dump. She tattles and I'm branded pervert for life. She should have been up hours ago, taking her dump at 8:15 like everybody else. I think it would be a good idea if you left Lucy to herself. I think I should make her a very special dinner this evening. Archie, I'm trying to be subtle. I think it would be a good idea if you let Lucy alone period. Don't say that. I have said it. Why don't you and I have dinner tonight? No. I'll never eating again. Don't laugh at me. Why would you tell your mother that I was peeping on you? Really? Do you think I'm some kind of a jerk? I think that's altogether too polite, Archie. What I really think is that scoptophilic scuzball. What? Oh, I found something you didn't know, didn't' I? It's the beginning of a highlight for me. Please, I know what scoptophilic means. It means a voyeur, a pervert, a peeping Archie. I believe the literal definition... Don't you believe that a person has a right to privacy? Even a television star? Lucy, I would not call you a star. I would call you a regular. Lucille Ball was a star. She was a major star. And I bet even she took the occasional dump. Let me ask you something, Archie. Are you crazy? Because if you are, I really think we should find a way to communicate that to my mother and try to get you some help. Lucy, darling, I don't want to fight. Don't touch me. He's crazy. He's lonely. And that makes him unique in the world, does it, mother, and impervious to lunacy? You should read his screenplay. He is a sensitive, passionate, complicated young man. If you so badly want a child that you can love or a boy toy you can screw, come to Los Angeles. I'll set you up some audition. You'll rent someone better suited for the role. You think I want to have sex with Archie? Yep. I remember seeing Katherine with Lucy and Walt always in physical contact, hand in hand, or parental palm to child's skull, lips to cheek. And yet I wanted to break them up and have her, Kay, for myself. As my old daddy once said, hard cock don't know nothing about respect. Right, Rick? Mr. Respect. Archie? Archie? Oh, God, Archie. Do you... um... do you... do you want to talk? No. Who am I going to be ordinary with? Who am I going to have babies with? Archie, your mind gives you great power. And with that power will come other things, including women. I don't want other women. I can buy women. I want Lucy. But she's not available. She has to be. But she's not. And you have to let her alone. You're just jealous. Of what? Of my relationship with... No. But I do miss my friend. And I'm here for you. Oh, no, Archie. No. Archie, Archie, don't. Please, Archie, don't. Ah, Jesus. An almost kiss. His breath was like a baby's. Almost scentless. What does it say about me that I was tempted to open my mouth to this child man, surrogate husband, child. Please don't turn me down at closing time. I'd rather take you home and make you mine, all mine. And I don't want stand in line alone. If you're going to turn me down, don't turn me on. Lucy Samuel, how are you doing? Good to see you. Hi. How are you? Everybody, why don't we let the hometown girl have a little air. What do you say? Well, well, well, lawyer Smith. I don't like the way you said that, darling. You know something I don't? I might, lawyer Smith. I might. But I think what I want right now is I want you to fill me up, Smitty. I can do that, darling. Bet you thought I meant something else. Be right back. Hurry, Smitty. Hurry. Can we get your autograph? Be right back, OK? OK. Uh... Miss Samuel... Yeah, hi. I don't know if you remember me, Gilbert Tellez. Gibby? Oh, Gibby, hombre. How are you, Lucy? Couldn't be better, Gibby. Well dance with me. Right here? Here. What are you doing with yourself, Gibby. Cece and I got married. Cecelia Martinez, you remember her? Cece Martinez, Jesus, you guys have been together for 100 years. We have a new baby. A baby? Wow. Wow. You were always were such bright, nice kid for a stud horse, Gibby. I like Lucy a lot. I understood her, you know? But when I asked her out, she said her folks wouldn't like it. We never told her who she could or couldn't go out with. Race was never an issue. And like a lot of kids, she dumped things on Walter and me that she didn't have the courage or cruelty to tell other people. Excuse me, Gilbert, we're together here. Mr. Smith with you, Lucy? Never saw him before in my life. Break his arms, Gibby. You take care of yourself, Lucy. What you've achieved means a lot to a lot of folks around here. Thank you, Gibby. Bring your baby out. Call me, OK? I'll call you. So you want to go outside, have a little walk, Lucy? Get some air. Dance, Smitty. Be romantic. Oh, well, having romantic fantasies about you for about a decade and a half now, especially every Tuesday between 8:00 and 9:00 in the evening. Jesus, Smitty, please. OK Lucy, come on, let's go. Give me your keys. You OK? Lucy? Lucille? I know what this is going to sound like, but I understand why men murder women. On the night I lost my race for the state senate, I came out to see Katharine. Of all people in the god damn world, I needed her to tell me I wasn't some worthless piece of crap. How could she be in there pounding the bedsprings with big man Walt Samuel when my friggin' plan to become friggin' president of the United States for her just gone into the toilet? And she didn't have a clue when to be available to a person. When you spray this place, Rick? Don't use that, all right? This is so awful tonight. It's just so sad that we haven't... that we're not... that we haven't improved. I mean, what's going to happen to everyone? It's a pretty big question, Lucy. Don't you hate the people who ask big questions? Pull over. Why? I'm feeling spontaneous. Lucy... what are you doing? Where are you going? Come on, Gibby. Tackle me. Football. Lucy, cut it out. Come on, tackle me. Come on, take me down, Gibby. Lucy, cut it out. Am I such a terrible person? No. Well, then why do people treat like I am? Like I'm dirty? We can untangle here, Lucy. You know, I used to wonder what my life might have been like if we'd... if we let our relationship happen. You could have play pro football. And your faith would have made me a great actress. I couldn't play pro ball, Lucy. See, I couldn't even stop you at the goal line. It's refreshing, a man who has so much respect for his wife. Not just for her, Lucy. For you too. Come on. Come on, let's go home. Come on, Lucy. I'm staying here. Come on. I'm going to have to drag you. No. OK? Come on, get back in the car. She's drunk. Hello, Archibus. Lucy. Why did I think I could come back here and feel like it used to? Did you ever notice, Archie Pasta, how nowhere feels like it used to? Pretend I'm your little girl, Archie Cap, and hold me. Nobody else has hold here anymore. Isn't there any daddy in men any more. I have daddy in me. Oh, Archie Cat, I can't steal you from mommy. Just be my daddy and give me rubbies. What are you doing? Nothing. Samuel summer home. Some are home, some are not. Oh, hi. Yeah, I got your letter. I don't... I don't know. I'm... I'm... I'm just not sure I'm prepared to take on a position this coming academic year. Yeah, sure, I'll think about it. I promise. Thank you. Bye. Job offer? Nine morons at Princeton sitting around inventing truth. Well, somebody's got to do that work. Well, that's wonderful, Archie, that they want you. I get job offers all the time, Mrs. Samuel. I may be a completely inept human being. But I'm an incredible mathematician. Maybe you should consider taking that job, Archie. What are you saying? Are you trying to get rid of me? Nothing happened between us last night, Lucy. Just think you ought to know. It's 2:00 in the afternoon. Guess who I saw at Calver's last night. I don't know, Lucy. Who? Lawyer Smith. It's... uh... driven me crazy for years. Did Daddy ever tell you what I told him? About what? I was 13. I was sitting on the front porch. In my freshman year at the university, I screwed up my umpteenth serious relationship and Daddy was extolling the virtues of marriage, so I told him. What? About you and lawyer Smith kissing. Oh, my God. That must have hurt you so badly, and your dad. Listen, just to keep the record straight, that relationship never went past that kiss. In fact, that night in the front seat of that car was the only time in 20 years of marriage that I have ever touched or been touched by anyone. I've been very selfish. Selfish, selfish. You have given so much to so many kids. Remember when I used to wake up at night when I was a little girl? Hold me from behind like you did then. Oh I remember a period when you were about three years old and you'd wake up in the night and come to Daddy's side of the bed with what he called your Martin Luther King's speech. Daddy, I have a dream. And he'd lift you between us. And we would cuddle you there. I miss you, Momma. Thank God, I have missed you. I have missed you. After holding Lucy for several hours, I walked to the cemetery where Walter is buried, where Lucy would soon be buried, and wanting to relieve Walter of some burden I can't imagine the dead actually have to bear. I tried to communicate to him that Lucy and I are going to help each other become all right. Most importantly for Lucy, it was a beginning. Monday, June 10th, corking Mike Donald, Jesus, good sport, terrible politics. My mom. Oh. Have you see my journal? No. Where'd you leave it? If I knew, I'd go to that place and get it. Good thinking. Hey, let's got to Juarez for lunch. Just the two of us. Remember that cafe? Red snapper smothered in pico de gallo. Is it still there? God, I haven't done there in years. I know. I'll get dressed. Hi, Archie. Yeah, still here. Still a member of this little ad hoc family. And by golly, I'll anxiously await your return. Well, Am I permitted to take off with my daughter alone? Absolutely. No one likes a good reconciliation better than I do. I'm changing my life Kind of formidable job for one day, wouldn't you say? Found it outside, out yonder. Did you read it? Let's change the subject. I've just completed a second draft of our screenplay. And I think you'll be pretty pleased with some of the adjustments I've made... Archie, what exactly are you getting at? Let me say only this, Lucy. In the midst of this poignant reconciliation between you and your mother, how would you like me to tell what kind of feelings you have for her? She's knows. No, Lucy. She doesn't. She only knows what she knows. What she doesn't knows is the poetic passion of your disdain for her. March 15th of last year, quote, "There I was in the park whacked out of my head on smack. I scream at the old lady and her pissing dog. I won't take care of you, mother, when you're old and shriveled, helpless. I won't be there for you because I hate you. I hate, hate, hate, hate you." Unquote. Utterly ridiculous, Mrs. S. I found it. He wants to tell you what he's read. Archie, did you read Lucy's journal? God, gee, I mean, you find the personal and private journal of the celebrated American personage, whom you happen to worship. Are you going to read it or not? I might want to. I'd like to think I could resist. Yeah, well, you would. You know you would. Don't you want to know what she had to say about you? No. Fine. I got to go do some stuff. You have a nice lunch in Juarez. Archie, I'm going to ask you to leave. Leave? You're going to ask me to leave? You're asking me to leave? I think it would be best for all three of us. Oh, I see. Now, you're deciding what's best for all three of us. You weren't even a human being till I showed up here. My daughter needs me. And I can't give her what she needs if you're here too. But I need you too. Accept that job. Use your wonderful mind. I don't want that job. I can have that job any time if any truth... I want to stay here with you and drive the tractor and grow veggies. Don't make this more difficult for her, Archie. Momma, I have a stretch mark under my left breast. It's underneath, but it's still there. Oh, no. It's like a zipper on a piece of soft-sided luggage. And here, look here, I have these little broken blood vessels on the bridge my nose. Oh, gosh, that's awful. You can cover that with makeup. Oh, momma, I want to lie down with someone I don't pretend is someone else. You will find someone. You are so beautiful. And you're so talented. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we not talk about me any more today. Wouldn't that be good, huh? Do you ever want to fall in love again, momma? Oh, that doesn't seem fair to your dad. But Daddy's gone. I know. What did you used to tell your classes every year, from "Lear" I think it was. You remembered that? Mm. Ah, ripeness is all. Let yourself be open to the possibilities. How was lunch, rapprochement in full flower. Yep. No booze. No pills. No other stuff. What else? Inquiring minds are keen to know. Actually, I've decided to quit the show and stay here. Clean myself up. Go back to school. Hey. It's a miracle in our time. You can have him. I don't want him. I'm leaving tomorrow, Lucy. Where will you go, Archie? Well, I'm just conjecturing, of course, but maybe I'll go play a couple of seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. Maybe I'll take up that acting thing, Replace you on "Banyon's Brood." Maybe go into extermination. Bugs and cockroaches. Something like that. I don't want him. He didn't love me. Because you see, Lucy, someone has got to lead the way to a formal, nationwide effort to purge our society of the unhealthy. Oh, I've decided to lead the revolution by ridding us of one member of one group that we can most definitely do without. Celebrities who ain't what they pretend to be. Anyway. We only want. Don't threaten me, Archie. Who is this little warped... I believe I'm quoting accurately from your journal entry dated this morning. You had no right to read that, Archie. You're a public figure, Lucy. You belong to your fans. And one of them, this one, is going to kill you. I'm going to end your life, Lucy, unless you make love with me. I'd rather die. Then that will serves as your last wish. Someone to play with. But all I want is... The wind started suddenly to howl through the house as it will without warning that time of year. I walked toward the door to close the screen and saw there in the distance in the gathering darkness my child on the ground, Archie above her, something in his hand held to her face. It's an image from every parent's nightmare. I explode out the door. But I seem to be moving in slow motion. The memory flashes in my head. Two boys outside my classroom the second year I taught, one screaming at the other. You don't got the balls. Instinctively, I want to correct the boy's grammar, but say instead, Arlen give me that God. And Arlen gives me the gun and cements my reputation for years to come. Archie, give the gun. No. For one day, it's the lead story IN all the newspapers and networks, bigger than the war in Bosnia, famine in Somalia, peace in the Middle East. That's 24 hours. America loves two things above all else, the joys that accrue to its celebrities and equally the catastrophes that befall them. It took us three days to find him in the desert, naked, dehydrated, his body covered with welts and bites. And even the doctor said self inflicted. He should have been dead from the exposure, but we found him under some scrub oaks singing some nonsense tune. I'm not going to sign any autographs at a funeral. No, this is a funeral. Have some respect. I'm not going to sign any autographs at a funeral. Kay? What you got there? - Bought her. It's new artillery. Why don't we... Well, I killed my cow and my calf. I don't want any living things on this property that depend on me. I held the momma's head until she died. It took a while. It's so strange after so many years to remember your smell, Joey. Well, I shouldn't call a man of your age Joey, should I, Joe? Joseph. Joey's fine, Kate. OK. That's a big chance for you, isn't it? Defending a celebrity murderer. Well, everybody's entitled to the best defense. He wants to see you. Now, for the sake of my case, I don't want him to, but if you want to see him, I can arrange it. In the movie of the week scheduled for sweeps week about my daughter's death, there should be a scene in which the mother goes to the jail under the pretense of talking to the murderer, of getting straight with them. She pulls a gun from her underwear and shoots the little pricks pecker off and is exonerated by a jury of peers on the grounds that she was temporarily out of her fricking mind. - Hello, Gilbert. - Mrs. Samuel. I need to check your purse to make sure you're not carrying anything that might be construed as a weapon. On my mom, Gilbert. Better check my underwear. Hello, Archie. Hello. Can't you come closer? Can't she come closer, Gibby. Just stay clear of the bars, Mrs. Samuel. It's all right, Kay. We'll be right here. How are you? Not that good, Archie. How about yourself? I wouldn't say I was too terrific either. Well, that's good. How are my oats and my veggies. I let them go. So what have you got to say for yourself? What have I got to say from myself, Archie? Yes, that's right. Did you think that I invited you here to sit unresponsively as you did all the time that Lucy and I were on a collision course. Or maybe you thought that I asked you to drop in to hear an apology. It crossed my mind, you might... you might want to make an apology, Archie. Did it ever cross your mind that it's you who owes me the apology? When you use your parents, you lose your past, Archie. But when you lose your children, you lose your future. You took away my future, Archie. We had just begun to reach to each other for the first time... Well, you should have reached out to each other a long time ago. But we didn't Well, you should have. What is... what? Am I on trial here. Yes. Because I get the impression you think you're some kind of pitiable victim. I should have been able to help you, to teach you, to stop you, to change you, to fix you, but I couldn't. Because you didn't try hard enough. No, Archie, I am not in this alone. I am not responsible for my daughter's death. Yes you are. Yes, you are. If I won't be responsible for myself, then you have to be. And I won't. So you are. You did this. You did it. You're the one. Then you're right. Then you're absolutely right, Archie. And I should stand trial for your actions, while you what? Sit on my swing and hurl epithets at the void because you are a lonely genius who couldn't get laid. Do you really think I would have chosen you over my own child. I didn't mean to hurt you. Don't touch me. Gilbert. Katherine, I want to be your future. I want to be your family. Mrs. Samuel, what you said in there. I just want you to know that you were a very important teacher to me. And I learned from you. I'm very sorry about what happened. Thank you, Gilbert. Listen to me, Archie, you can't go into court and project that kind of remorse. Would I ever do anything to endanger your book deal or your Miller Genuine Draft commercial, Smitty. I'm going to get you off, Archie. We'll have brewskies. See you tomorrow. Ay, ay, ay, I am a Chicano grande. I live in a trailer, got a fat wife and 12 kids because we don't have no condoms, no birth control pills. You're ignoring me. And I don't like it. Ay, ay, ay, my Goon Lips, he does it by Jesus. What did I tell you about calling me Goon Lips, Mr. Landrum. I don't know, Goon Lips. let me think. You really figure, Mr. Landrum, you will say you are crazy and you'll go free? I know it. But, hey, you're the one that believes in all that confession, contrition. Gives you the license to do whatever the hell you want to. Oh, poor Dio, I sorry. I make a mistake. That's OK, you're forgiven. I have to take a stand about what kind of world I'm going to leave my child, Mr. Landrum. As the story goes, Archie grabbed the deputy's keys after calling him into his cell, complaining of excruciating abdominal pains. What are you doing, Mr. Landrum? Where you get those keys? You just tossed them to me. And supposedly, Archie grabbed the deputy's gun. Let go of my gun, Mr. Landrum. I didn't try to take your gun. Cut it out. Then Archie tried to make a run for it. Are you crazy, Mr. Landrum. You can't get out of here. Oh, Jesus. Don't call on Jesus, Mr. Landrum. He's not available to you. OK. I want to go back to my cell now. Let me go back to my... Officer needs assistance. Gilbert, in the name of your Lord and your Savior Jesus Christ, you cannot do this. Oh, but I can. Gilbert, place the gun down. You know, I wasn't crazy by Dr. Landrum. I felt awful about what I had to do. As the days passed, I feel only regret and not guilt. And I'll go on. I know what happened. At least I think I do. I asked the DA to investigate, but he told me that he saw no evidence whatsoever that one of the county's most trusted law enforcement agents had perpetrated a vigilante murder. "People" friggin' magazine. I swore I was going to destroy all the journals. But I decided to look in one selection, Just simply turning to the book I happened to be holding. It was written five long years ago when she was about to open a play in New York. I mean of all the pages, fate, luck made me turn to this page in this book. Oh, sure, I'm doing this for myself. But I want my parents to be proud, because hard as it is to accept sometimes, everything I do is repayment to them for their love, even though I don't know how to say that to them anymore, or at least to my mother. I love you, momma. I wish it were possible how ironic that will make a difference. I got to go. I have to go. And thank you all. You've all really been great. Thanks. Oh, for heaven's sake. Oh, no. Well, let's eat. Thank you. You can have him. I don't want him. He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with. But all I wanted was a love to stay. Well, if you get that, that dumb fella, there's only one thing that you can do. Just dig a hole and jump right in it and pull the ground right, right over you. You can have him. I don't him. He didn't love anyway. He only wanted someone to play with. But all I wanted was a love to stay. The boy I loved, he up and left me. He ran away, yeah, with my best friend. Comes back home for just an hour. When the daylight comes, he's gone again. You can have him. I don't want him. He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with. But all I wanted was a love to stay. Life without love is mighty empty, but you know confession is good for the soul. I'd rather have a love that I can cling to than have the world and all its gold. You can have him. I don't want him. He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with. But all I wanted was a love to stay. You can have him. I don't want him. He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with. But all I wanted was a love to stay. You can have him. I don't want him. He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with.
