Pretty tough drivin' this buggy with these spurs on, but I'd feel naked without 'em. This time of year you need a reservation. Name's Heyward. A reservation is... That's Heyward of Heyward Oil. Oh, that Heyward. Thought that'd make a little difference. Indeed. I'll have your car taken care of. And if you ask for the manager, he'll have something for you. Hey, you. Me? Yes, you! You can't park that thing in the driveway. Take it on outta here. Mister Hathaway, who do you think just drove up? Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh. Oops, sorry, Miss. I hope I didn't hurt you. Spurs got locked here. Tricky little devils. Mister Heyward, I presume. Yeah. Welcome to the Shores Hotel, sir. You know me, huh? Don't recollect meeting you before, Mister.. Hathaway, sir. Howdy, Mister Hathaway. Glad to know ya. Look, Mister Hathaway, my bones are bendin' in the middle. Need a nice soft place to stretch 'em out on. What you got? Well, I think we can find something suitable, sir. Fine. Oh, sorry there. Oh, hello there. Everything under control? Mister Heyward? Oh, yeah. I think we found the very thing for you, sir. Bell Captain! Show Mister Heyward to the presidential suite. Presidential suite. Well, bein' as how I couldn't make a reservation, reckon that'll just have to do. Nice meetin' you, Mister Heyward... Mister Hathaway. The stands were full and you could feel the electricity in the air. I think it was probably one of the most exciting things that ever happened to me. I'll show you. Would you hold that, please? Thank you. Now, just imagine... Here are the four of us. Right in the beginning, one guy toes in and bam! He's wiped out of the race. Now there's just three of us left. All of a sudden, bam! One of the boats flips right over, and now there were only two of us. Just two of us in the race. Now I know it's time for me to make a move... Mister Jamison? Yeah, Charlie. I put that new prop on, set her in the water, waitin' for ya. I'll be right there. Ladies, as much as I hate to leave you. Don't go. Finish your story. Oh, well, to make a long story short... I won. And I set a new record when I was doing it, too. But right now my very first love is this coming race, so I'm gonna take "The Scarlet Lady" out to North Point, put her through her paces. And I might, just might, be able to squeeze in one passenger. Any volunteers? I'd like to go. You would? Mister Jamison, I just love to squeeze. So do I. Come here. Yes? I'm Wilson. Tom Wilson. I'm sorry, Mister Wilson. We're really very full up. Oh, I'm not looking for a room. Oh, good. I'm the new ski instructor. Oh. Oh, Wilson! The employees' quarters are... Excuse me, Mister Hathaway. You're the new ski instructor? Care for an appointment tomorrow? Not tomorrow. Now. Mister Wilson doesn't start until tomorrow. Well, Mister Wilson, could you, as a special favor to me, start your lessons today? I guess I could. I have to check in my room, drop this off. Fine, fine. Let's meet at the ski dock in five minutes? Five minutes? Unless you can make it sooner. Mister Hathaway. Yes? Exactly where is North Point? Are you sure you need lessons? Oh, yes, yes. Thought you'd wipe out for sure that time. Guess I was lucky. Sure is a beauty. Yes, isn't he? Somebody you know? Not yet. What are you tryin' to do? Anything else I can teach you? So then what happened? I was teachin' her to keep her balance and then this hot boat goes by. She starts doin' stunts like she was born and raised in Cypress Gardens. Where may I ask did you get that? Nifty, huh? I knew you'd like it. Twenty bucks. I never paid twenty bucks for a tie in my life. You did today. Next time, let me pick 'em out. It is my reputation. And, boy, am I gonna have fun with it. Tonight I'm double-dating with a fellow millionaire, name of Jamison. Maybe you know him. He's in jammies. In what? Jammies, those things girls wear that are supposed to be nightgowns. He's in 'em. He wears 'em? No, he makes 'em. The jammies? Yeah. He comes down once a year for the race. He's won the last three in a row, which is no wonder, considering that boat of his. It must've cost a fortune. I wonder if he's got more money than I do. Anyhow, she's a big red job, you know, and as she comes out of that water... That wouldn't be "The Scarlet Lady"? Yeah. That's the boat Dianne put on the show for. Oh, I've got it. She's after him too, huh? As far as tonight is concerned, her little prank of this afternoon came to nought. Jammies Jamison and I have made other plans. Straighten your tie anyway. Thank you. Make yourself comfortable. Should you need anything, just call for room service. Feel free to sign my name. Oh, thanks. Get outta here. Hey, Mister Jamison. Hi, Paul. Same as always, please. JJ special, right? Got it waitin' for you. Hey, Mister Jamison, I wanna ask you somethin'. You've come in here for years. My wife's been buggin' me. She wants me to ask would it be possible to get some Jamie Jammies wholesale? Hate to ask you, but... Your wife? Yeah. Sure! Yeah, my wife, really. My wife! Really? Yeah. Sure, Paul. I'll take care of it as soon as I get back to New York. As a matter of fact, we have a new item that's coming out this year. Well, it is so sheer, you don't know where the jammie stops and the girl starts. Hey, hey, hey! Forget it. Huh? I got six kids already. More I don't need, right? Oh, yeah. How 'bout something in flannel? Flannel? Yes, Miss. What'll it be? What is that? That? That's a JJ special. That looks interesting. Or would dangerous be a better word? That all depends on your mood. It can be interesting or dangerous, or both. Oh, I see. In your case, it would make you dangerously interesting. I'll have one. You got one. Pardon my curiosity, but haven't I seen you before, like this afternoon? I doubt it. I was skiing this afternoon. Oh, then it was you. Remember the racing boat that stopped? "The Scarlet Lady"? Oh. That was me. Oh, really. That was some fancy maneuvering. Oh, that was nothing. Well, I'm James Jamison. And you're? Dianne Carter. How do you do? Hey, ole saddle-buddy. Yahoo! Oh, Scotty. Excuse me. Oh, Gloria, this is JJ Jamison. How do you do? Likewise, I'm sure. Come on, JJ, let's bust outta this here corral and stampede us some excitement. You ready to go? Ready, willing and able. Be right back. I'll see you. We're off. Well, hi. You waitin' for someone? Not any more. Well, in that case, may I? Yes. About that ski lesson this afternoon. I guess I do owe you an apology. That's all right. Just don't let it happen again. This is my first time in Miami and you're the first girl I've met. Thought I'd look around. Would you like to come along? Why not? It sounds like fun. I got it. See you as soon as we change. Change? Sure. Slacks are your best bet on a motorcycle. A motorcycle? You must be kidding. Sorry. That's the way I travel. I'll meet you in... Five minutes. Five minutes? Unless you can make it sooner. Touché. How you doin'? Fine. Hey, come on. Okay. Oh, I must be getting old. Look, I get off work tomorrow at four o'clock. How'd you like to go for a boat ride and... No. Tom, don't waste your time with me. I'm not rich and my family's not rich. What do you mean? I understand. You guys come here for the season, cabana boys, lifeguards, ski instructors, all hoping to find a girl with money, lots of it. Oh, I see. I was that obvious? Oh, no. No. It just takes one to know one. We're two of a kind. What do you think I'm doing down here? I mean, for years I scrimped and saved. I even went into hock. Half my clothes are borrowed and the other half I sewed Saks labels into just so I could come down here and... Land a millionaire. Right. I admit it. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I don't even know why you went out with me. It's not in your plans. I guess I kind of like you. Besides, who knows, might even make him jealous. Him being Jamison? Yes. Maybe you need a few more ski lessons. You'll help me? Why not? If it pays off, you might return the favor. And who knows? Maybe he's got a sister.

Yeah. They better advance that engine. It's running too cool. That boat came in second in last year's regatta. She's not comin' in anywhere this year, if they keep that up. Listen to it. You've got a pretty good ear. Name's Burton. Sam Burton. Tom Wilson. I haven't seen you here before. I'm the hotel's ski instructor. Oh. I thought you had something to do with one of those outfits. No. I'm just interested. I've been around 'em. We lost one on that south turn last year. Yeah? What happened? It was an experimental model I was working on. When she got up to eighty-five she began to vibrate. At ninety she started coming apart. I couldn't hold her and we rammed into a pylon. Maybe you'll have better luck this year. I'm not entering this year. Costs too much to rebuild her, with the hope we'd find out what went wrong. If you know of anybody that wants a busted-up outfit, send 'em to my place. Your place? Burton Boat Company. Oh, you're that Sam Burton. Yes. Nice talking with you, Wilson. Same here, Mister Burton. Water-skiing, anyone? Oh, hi. I just saw JJ heading down to the beach. In that case, you'd better get busy. But this time I'll drive. Are you ready? Hit it. Hey. Hey, who's that? Funny you should ask. That happens... Never mind. I'll find out for myself. Let's go. Pour it on! Let's go! Go, go, go! Follow that boat. Get the girl! Yeah! Go! Go! Hi. Hi there. Hi, beautiful. Hey, wait a minute. Turn, turn, turn! Let's go! Come on! Go! Wait for us. Not so fast. Wait for us! Hey, hey, hey, wait for us. Hey, beautiful. Slow down there! Closer, Phil. Closer. Hey, beautiful. Hold out your hand. Hey! Give me your hand. Easy, easy, easy. No, no, no! Hey, look. Come on. Are you all right? No. Turn around. What's the matter? I lost my top! Oh, good timing. Jamison's swimming over here. Go back. Please go back. Go away! Hey, that was really some tricky skiing you were trying. I wasn't trying. Oh? I lost my balance. Will you please go away. Her balance wasn't all she lost. Oh? Oh. Is this what you're looking for? Oh, please may I have it? No. Not till you promise to have a few drinks with me. All right, I promise, I promise. Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. Say, can I help? No, I can manage all by myself, thanks. Turn around, please. Oh, oh. Back together? Yes, I'm fine now. Come on, we'll go back in my boat. All right. You could start a whole new fad. What? Topless water-skiing. Come on, let's go. Yeah. Well, you can't blame a chick for wantin' the finer things in life, can you? Hey, Scott. Wait for me! Hey, come on. Was it something I said? It's a long way back. Here, Flipper. Here, boy. Yoo-hoo! So the funny thing is she thinks... Oh, speak up. I'm a little waterlogged. I said the funny thing is she thinks I'm here for the same reason she is, to marry for money. If she's so interested in money, how come she never made a play for me? Too much competition. Yeah. Guess so. It'll be interesting to see how she makes out with old JJ. Of course, with Jamison there's only one way. What's the matter? That bother you? No. It's her problem, not mine. Hey, hey, kids. Hey, kids. Kids, hold it down. Quiet! What's the matter? They think I'm afraid to slide down. Why don't you show 'em they're wrong? Cos I am afraid. Come on. Try it. No. I'll stand right here and catch you. I can't.

I thought we might take "The Scarlet Lady" for a run. Then there's a clambake tonight. Now I ask you, how you gonna compete with all that money? One way would be in the race. We have a boat? We have three, but they're in Texas. On your salary, that's where they'll stay. But with your bank account... Hold it, pal. Aren't you trying to prove something, without using your money? Thanks. Just forget the whole thing. Hey, I just thought of something. I know where I might get a boat. For ten bucks? Ten thousand would be more like it. Even then, you couldn't get it in shape for the Orange Bowl race. Could we see it? Sure. Come on along. But I want to tell you one thing. I spent a lot of time and money on this boat. The condition it's in now, I don't think you've got a prayer. Hull needs rebuilding, and the engine. Too much money for you, Tom, unless your friend wants to sponsor you. Well, ole sport, here's my checkbook. If you say so, I'll fill her out. I'm tempted, but no, thanks. What... What makes you so sure you can solve the problem, when my engineers feel it's a lost cause? I'm not sure, but I'd like to try. You know you've two weeks to the race? I sure do. And still you wanna do it on your own? Yeah. Well, I admire that. The Orange Bowl Regatta has a purse of ten thousand dollars. If you win it, we'll split it fifty-fifty. Fair enough? You're not kiddin' me, are ya? No, son, I'm not. Hey! How 'bout that, pal? Okay. Where'd you like to work on her? Well, the ski shop at the hotel is fine. All right. She's all yours. Thanks, Mister Burton. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, let's get her movin'. Maybe I can start before the clambake. What's the matter? You just said the magic word. Clambake? Yeah!

Pull up a log and join us. Lotta food left over. I couldn't eat another bite. Hey, I saw you hauling Burton's folly to the hotel. Gonna convert it to a ski boat? Not exactly. Getting it ready for the race. You're putting me on. You think so? Yes. It wouldn't hold when it was new. Be no better with an amateur patch job. James! I just think he's stepping out of his league. Stick to what you know. You mean stay where I belong? You might say that, yes. Thanks for the advice. I hope you won't mind if I don't take it. No, I don't mind. Might be good for a laugh. Hey, how 'bout you and me goin' on a treasure hunt? Treasure hunting? Where? Didn't you know? Out there, a sunken pirate ship loaded with bullion. Soup? Gold. Went down in a hurricane one hundred years ago. And it's still there? On a clear night, like tonight, you can even see it... They say. You can? Yeah, come on. I'll show you. Okay. Hey, that sounds like a good idea. Why don't we go find some treasure? All right. You should get yourself a girl. Did you ask him if he had a sister? Hey, come on. Oh, hello, Mister Burton. I see you're working later than usual tonight. Can't be helped, that is if we wanna win that ten thousand dollars. Sure wouldn't mind. I had a lot of hopes for that boat. After ten years of trying, I thought I finally had a design that could win. You did. The fault wasn't in the design. What do you mean? The hull broke cos the protective covering gave way. Can break it off with your hand. The same thing'll happen again. What's on here is the best resin I know of. Would you do me a favor, Mister Burton? Sure. Hit it as hard as you can. Hit it? Sure. Go ahead. Hit it. Like this. What have you got on here? It's called Goop. That's the abbreviation. The technical name is a foot long. Where did you get this? Place I used to work. I majored in engineering and then I got a job in a lab. While I was there, I helped develop this hardener. If it's so good, why isn't it on the market? It's not that good. Put it on the water for any length of time it turns to jelly. Then what's the point? The company gave up on it. I didn't. Mister Burton, could I use your lab to try some experiments? I'd work nights. I wouldn't be in anybody's way. You think you might be able to work something out with this, huh? I don't know, but I'd sure like to try. My wife died a long time ago and we never had any children. I've always missed not having a son. I don't seem to miss it so much anymore. Just lock up before you leave. I'm going to bed. Thanks, Mister Burton. Night. Hey, hey! Want some coffee? Needs more cream and sugar. What do you call this thingamajig? Rocker arm. Rocker arm. Yeah. Manifold, carburetor, rocker arm. Got it. Oh-oh. I'm supposed to meet Sally in ten minutes. Guess I better get goin'. Go ahead. Thanks for your help. Think nothin' of it, pardner. Once in a while every rich man ought to labor side by side with the workin' folks. Mighty decent of you. You look beat. Why not knock it off for the rest of the day? Hey, listen. I just met a gorgeous redhead. I was gonna save her for myself, but anything for a pal. No, I've work to do at the lab. Would you see if that package has arrived? First thing. If it's here, I'll send it to ya tout de suite, that's French for pronto. Hey, ole buddy. That race is only four days off. Yeah, I know. Thanks, pal. Hi, Scott. I just saw Sally in the lobby. She's looking all over for you. By doggies, that dame just won't leave me alone. And do I love it! Hi. Hi. How's it going? How are things with Jamison? All right. I'm meeting him on the dock and we're taking a boat to the club for dinner. Sounds very romantic. He's romantic all right. His proposals just don't include marriage. I wouldn't let that worry me. One of these nights, instead of going to the club, he'll ask you up to his room. He's gonna play some very soft music and have the perfect dinner. Pheasant, under glass, of course, and wine, and dessert. Let's see. Cherries jubilee. And after that... If you get that far, you've got it made. Tom, what's the matter? Nothing. All right. I'll see you. Hey. Come here. Blot. Unless Jamison's blind, maybe he can see the trees instead of the forest.

By that I mean I really don't see at all. I'll tell you about it sometime. Fair enough. How's it going? I'll know better when I try these with this. Well, good luck. Hello, Mister Burton. Hello, Tom. Looks like you could use another hand. I could use ten! All right. Where do I start? Start up front. Keep the brush moving. This stuff sets pretty fast. So this is it, hm? Yep, that's it. You really think it's gonna do the job? I think so. Think so? You haven't tested it yet? I haven't got the time. It takes twenty-four hours for it to harden. Doesn't leave any time before the race. Also, it doesn't leave any room for error. Well, like I was tellin' somebody the other day, you gotta have confidence. Howdy, gents. What you up to? You know what time it is? Never pass inspection, pardner. "Pardner", you were supposed to be here two hours ago. You promised to help me. A Heyward never goes back on his word.

Can I help you, sir? Well, now. Howdy, ma'am. How y'all? Howdy, sir. I said may I help you. Yes, well... I think I'll try a few of these here stogies. Unless I'm mistaken, you must be Scott's father. Well, land o' Goshen, course I am. You know that boy o' mine? Everybody knows your son. I see you both smoke the same brand. Yes, yeah... What? My boy Scott ain't never smoked a cigar in his life. He's my best customer. Oh, is that so? In that case you'd be able to tell me where he might be at this hour of the day. I'd say in about four minutes you could head him off at the bar. Head him off at the pass, huh? The bar? Buying drinks for everyone. This Florida climate sure does strange things to people, doesn't it? You mean he's been smokin'? An' drinkin'? Anything else? Looks like I just 'bout got here in time, don't it, huh? There you go. Thank you, sir. Not at all. Yeah, seems like the daddy's always the last one to find out. Cigarettes? Cigars? Cigarettes? Howdy, sir. Howdy. The lady back there said I might be likely to find a fella name of Scott Heyward here. You know him? She told you right. You a friend of his? You might say that, yeah. Name your drink. It's on him. For Heyward's friends, the elbow bends. Well, now, ain't that a mighty pretty, little ditty? But, if you don't mind, sir, I'd just as soon have a piece of your best drinkin' whiskey. We might as well wait together, Mister Heyward. I know you, sir? Burton's the name. Burton Boat Company. Remember three years ago you tried to grab my company? Oh, yeah! Of course I do now. What happened? I thought we had a deal. We did, until your hard-headedness bumped smack into my stubbornness. Well, this boy o' mine, you know, he's a boat fancier. So I kinda figured I'd buy up your outfit, kinda give it to him as a birthday present. I don't know what he'd do with it. Seems to me he'd got all he needs, money to burn, plenty of women, living it up every day. Hold on there, Mister Burton, just a minute. What's wrong with all you people here? You know who you're talkin' about, cos you certainly ain't describin' my boy? Seeing is believing. Yeah, well, if I knew what I was seein' then maybe I could believe it. Your boy Scott, right there. Where? Oh, there. Sure enough, there he is. Excuse me. Wait a minute. You mean that boy there is your son? You bet your socks and garters he is. Yes, sir. He's the ski instructor here in the hotel. His name's Tom Wilson. Friend, I'm not too sure just what it is you're drinkin' out of this glass here, but one thing I am sure of, I do know my own son. Mister Heyward, you and I better have a talk. Later, Mister Burton. No, now. It's about your boy. Come on. Oh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, pardner. Been waitin' for ya. I want you to meet somebody. This here's Gigi. Gigi, this here's Monsieur Wilson. He's my best friend, even if he is poor. How do you do? Je suis enchantée, Monsieur Wilson. She doesn't speak any English. I'm gonna teach her all I know. Oh, really? About English. Please, join us, Tom. Yes, why don't you? We're democratic. Thank you. Would you care to dance? Yes. What do you say, Dianne? You'll love the view from my suite. And then after I put on a little soothing music, I'll make you a JJ special. Then a little breast of pheasant. Under glass? Of course. And a vintage wine. And then, of course, my favorite dessert. Cherries jubilee. How did you ever guess? Female intuition. I'll get my purse. Well, good night, everyone. See you tomorrow. If you'll excuse me, I'll call it a night. Hold on for a second. Au revoir. Très bonne chance à mon chapeau. Yeah? Know what that means? Yeah. Goodbye and good luck to my hat. Tom. Turning in early? Yep. Get a good night's sleep. Gonna give the boat a final once-over? I just checked it two hours ago. One last time won't hurt. You never know what you might find by being thorough. Take a look, as a favor to me. I'll check it out. I hear tell you're entered in this big boat race tomorrow. Pa! Figure to win? Hope so. Fella named Burton says you stand better than a fifty-fifty chance. It's good to see you, Pa. Don't go jumpin' to no conclusions. He also told me you did just about all the work on this yourself. That right? Most of it. Figure it's gonna hold together this time? I do. You willin' to go out there tomorrow, maybe get yourself killed to find out? Yep. Find out. To find out about myself, to see if I can cut it on my own. Pa, I'd have traded everything you've given me for one thing, for trusting me. What you talkin', son? I always trusted you. I was just tryin' to make things easy. I don't want things easy. I wanna be able to make mistakes and work' em out before you push the panic button, like at the plant. I'm gettin' tired of all this calf-bawlin' about panic button and trustin' and stuff. Suppose you just listen to me for a second, fella. This company of ours spent nine hundred million dollars on this gook or goop. We couldn't make it work. Now you tell me you're gonna go out in this boat tomorrow and if this hangs together, then you've proved somethin'? That's right! Then, boy, whether you do or you don't, I want you to know that... That I'm as proud of you as any father's ever set foot on this God's green earth. Thanks, Pa. Yeah. I guess we kinda settled that pretty good, didn't we? Well, I'm feelin' a little tuckered out. How 'bout you seein' me back to my hotel room? I'll be pleased to, Pa. These are lovely rooms, James. Very exotic. They should be. They call it the Sultan's Suite, and I take it every year. Where do you keep your harem? Whatever gave you an idea like that? To us. I realize I might've been considered a bit of a playboy. Just a bit. Yes, but that's over. What I need now is the warmth of companionship and the escape from loneliness. The simple beauty that one girl, the right girl, can offer. James! There's somebody at the door. Here's your dry-cleaning, Mister Jamison. Sorry it's a little late. Thanks a lot. Now, where were we? Escaping from loneliness. Yes, the escape from loneliness and the simple beauty that one girl, the right girl, can offer. You said that. And then I... There we go, twenty-six-D, for Duster. That's me, ain't it? That's right. Right! Well, son, I'm gonna be with you every foot of the way. You know that, don't you? I know it now, Pa. Thanks. Good night. Good night. I... I have to catch my breath. That's not the reason. No, it isn't. Dianne. Did I tell you about the present? What present? The one that I'm gonna give you. Well, it's a trinket, and it goes on this finger. And it's about five carats. I'm asking you to marry me. If you knew how I had hoped for this moment. I... I... James, please. James, you have a big day tomorrow. James! It's a big night tonight! What is it? I've got your ski. What! Your ski's fixed. Thought I'd drop it off. Do you know what time it is? Sure, but I thought you wanted it. James, I'll let him in. No! No, no. Besides, I should be leaving. Leaving? But why? We were just... Just going to say good night. Excuse me. I hope I'm not interrupting. As a matter of fact you are. No, it's all right. James and I were just... Well, you'll be the first to know. Tomorrow we're picking out a ring, a double celebration. First for winning the race and second... Well, we're announcing our engagement. Well, congratulations. Thank you. And thank you for the evening. Sweet dreams, darling. Hey, you know something? You really have lousy timing. Born losers usually do. If you're talking about the race... I'm talking about you sticking your nose in. I hope you know how to take care of yourself. I call karate!

Tom, I'm going to call James and tell him that I can't marry him. Oh? I'd like to thank you for all your help. Any time. Well, good night. And goodbye. Goodbye? I'm leaving for home tomorrow, after the race. Good afternoon. This is Sam Riddle welcoming you to the Marine Stadium in beautiful Miami, Florida, where we are waiting to see the running of one of the country's great races, the Governor's Trophy. And ten thousand dollars go to the winner of the big one, the Orange Bowl Regatta. The crews have completed the checkups. All the boats are now in the water. That means it won't be long now. The fans are still coming in... Hey, Monsieur Heyward! Oh, there you are. I got you some American popcorn. Now, you can stop your sweating, Sam. If my boy says that Goop'll hold, it'll hold. I just wish I were as sure as you were. Me, too. Hey, Dianne. Here we are. Yoo-hoo! Hey! Okay, gang, shift. One, two, three. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the drivers are coming by for their presentation lap. Approaching the grandstand in "Vapor Trail", boat number ninety-six, is Fred Whiting. And right behind in "Bad Boy", number thirteen, is Lucky Hughes. Then comes James Jamison in "The Scarlet Lady", bearing the number D-three. That's the boat to watch. He's won it the last three years in a row and is the favorite to repeat today. Following Jamison comes "Terry's Pet", number fifty-two, driven by George Gergo. George came in second last year. Following Gergo is Paul Jerrow. And there is Tom Wilson in "Rawhide", number ninety-nine. That's the same boat that couldn't take the pounding last year. The pressure on those racing hulls is tremendous. It came apart at ninety miles per hour. The big question is can this rebuilt hull take that same kind of pounding today? Because all indications are that this year's race is going to set new speed records. Excuse me, girls, I'll be right back. Okay. Hurry back. Following now is Glenn Peters in number seventy-seven, "The Redball Express". Howdy, Mister Burton. Good luck today. Thanks. Pardon the binocs, sir. Don't believe I've met you. You two've got a lot in common. Oh, yeah? You're rich too, huh? Howdy. My name's Heyward. Scott Heyward. I'm in oil. Yeah, yeah. Well, how do, Mister Heyward? I'm proud to meet you. I'm in oil too, don't you know? Say, have a cigar. Well, thank you. Thank you kindly. How 'bout you have one of mine, boy? Well, thank you kindly. That's funny, you know. I got a feelin' I know your daddy. Oh, yeah? You know Dad. Wonderful. Grand ole gentleman. What's your name, sir? My name? Sir, I don't believe I quite caught your name. Oh. Oh, yes. Heyward. Duster, that is, Heyward, son. You all right, boy? Oh. Did I just swallow my cigar? No matter. No harm done. Here you go, have another. No, no, no. You smoke it, Buster... Duster. You take that. Take 'em all now. Oh, the race. Gotta go. So long, Dad. Be mighty careful now. Your engine's running! Now coming onto the course is the Orange Bowl helicopter. It's heading over to meet the boats as they complete their warm-up lap... Quick. Give me some popcorn. The last of the drivers are now in line and ready to go. There they are, ladies and gentlemen. The cream of the nation's racing boats. They're holding positions for this two and a half mile course, and coming to the starting line. On the helicopter is the official starter. As soon as the boats are in order, he'll drop the signal and we'll begin. And there it is! It's a clean start. As they come to the first turn, the "Cobra" is holding his lead. That's Jeff Casey in number fifteen. He's going wide in an effort to cut around, I think it's Copper Rourke. And here comes JJ Jamison. Can he make it four in a row? He's really moving out. He's passing Roberts.v Now he's moved into fourth position. Now third. And he's closing on Whiting. And he passes him! Now he's trying to take the "Cobra". And he's done it, folks. "The Scarlet Lady" has taken the lead. No doubt about it. JJ Jamison is once more the man to beat. The rest of the boats are bunched up and there are no clear challengers. There goes the "Rawhide". Tom Wilson is really stepping on it. He's moving past the pylon. Now, coming out of the turn, he cuts to the inside, trying to pass Whiting. And there he goes. The "Rawhide" is now running in third place. Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, baby. Come on, Rawhide. Round the turn, "The Scarlet Lady" is still holding first place. Wait a second. And the "Rawhide" continues to move up. Come on! Come on! Come on! Go, Rawhide! Jamison is making sure that anybody who hopes to take him will have to push his boat to the limit. Wilson is moving up on the "Cobra" now. He's going to make his pass. Wilson is closing the gap. Closing, closing. He did it! Wilson is now running second to "The Scarlet Lady". That last lap was clocked at over ninety miles per hour. That's the same speed that broke the "Rawhide's" hull last year. Question is will history repeat itself, as Jamison continues to hold that shattering speed and Wilson is staying right up there with him. Wait a minute. Wilson is having some kind of trouble. "The Scarlet Lady" is increasing its lead as the "Rawhide" falls back. The "Cobra" has retaken second place. Wilson seems to have found the trouble. He's regaining his speed now. He's going to pass the "Cobra". He's back in second place! Look out! Jamison must be pushing a hundred. The beating he's giving his boat is tremendous. If Wilson hopes to stay with him, he's got to give his boat the same punishment. Remember, that's the hull that split apart last year under even less strain. Can that rebuilt hull take the beating this year? It's holding up. If the "Rawhide" can take that pounding, it can take anything. The question now is can he catch "The Scarlet Lady" with less then two laps to go? Going into the last lap, Jamison continues to hold the lead. Come on, Tom. Come on, Tom. Come on, Tom. Go! Go! Go! They're coming out of the final turn. The checkered flag's out. Come on, Goop! Come on, baby! And he's done it! The "Rawhide" wins! We have a new champion, ladies and gentlemen. And a true champ indeed. Tom Wilson in his first Orange Bowl race has snatched victory from the man who has won the Grand Prix for the past three years. Congratulations to Tom Wilson. The presentation of the award is tonight in the ballroom of the Shores Hotel. Hey, you did! You really did it! Man, what a boat! When you took that last turn I could've sworn you were airborne. Celebration time. Yep. Your pa's sure proud of you. You ought to see him, passin' out cigars like a new daddy and braggin' away. Burton says that Goop'll be the hottest thing to hit the boat business. Oh, yeah? Well, Scott, here's to you, ol' buddy. Here's to you, ol' buddy. Somethin' wrong? No. I'm just waitin' for a phone call. You have to accept my trophy tonight. Wait a minute. No, sir, no. You won that trophy. You pick it up. You proved what you set out to prove. Now it's time we went back to being us. Besides, I wanna find out if Sally likes me for myself or for your money. I know what you mean, pal. Hello. She's ready to leave now. Okay. Thanks, Harold. Stall her off, will ya? Gimme the keys. Keys? Oh, here. What's up? I'll explain later. Just wish me luck. You got it. Would you please hurry? I need a cab. You've never been to Connecticut? No. A cab? You really should go... A cab? Oh, well, here it is. Taxi, Miss? Hop in. Take you anywhere you wanna go, compliments of Scott Heyward. I wish you weren't going home today. Under the circumstances, it's best. Kinda hoped you'd stay and help me spend my prize money. Thanks, but you should put that money in a bank, not spend it on me. It's too late. I already did. Tom! Tom Wilson, take this ring back to the store. Then you're saying you won't marry me? I'm saying we can't afford it. This ring would pay our rent for a year, plus groceries... Then you're saying you will marry me? Yes, of course I will. Dianne, I have a confession to make. About what? About my family. But I'm marrying you, not your family. About my being a ski instructor... Look, darling, listen. With whatever you earn, plus my salary, we'll make out fine. Only we can't afford things like this ring, much as I wish we could. You see that oil field over there? I was given one ten times that size on my twenty-first birthday. Ten times? Oh. You see that yacht? I was given one just like it on my last birthday. D'you know what I think? I think driving Scott's car is giving you delusions. That's what I'm trying to tell you. What? That's who I am. Who? I'm Scott Heyward. Oh, and I'm Hortense Fiegledopper. Listen, will you please be serious? Look. See for yourself. It started on the way down. I stopped at this restaurant and met Scott... Tom. The real Tom. Hey, Dianne? Dianne, you all right? I'm sorry if I'm rich or if I said something to upset you. I can explain the whole thing. Like I said, I stopped at one of my gas stations... I mean, one of our gas stations. While the attendant was putting in the gas, I went for a coffee and met Scott... Tom. Checked and Corrected by JCS
