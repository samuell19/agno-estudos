Stretching from the mouth of the valley to the fertile plain is the Serra, a straight mountain ridge, a glacial moraine that filled the Aosta Valley 10,000 years ago. When the Romans had conquered all of Gaul to the Rhine, Gallic tribes in Alpine valleys retained their freedom and controlled the passes. In the Aosta Valley it was the Salassi tribe. They lived in this hill country and ran gold and copper mines. In the year 25 BC, Rome fought a last war against the valley dwellers. Emperor Augustus wanted "Roman Peace" here too, and the Salassi tribe suffered a horrible end. Many horses were bred here, at the Roman military outpost Eporedia, for war, for commerce, and also for races. The word "Eporedia" comes from the Greek hippos, for "horse," and the Gallic word reda, for "wagon." Today Eporedia is called Ivrea. The Dora river flows through it from the valley. On the foundations of the Roman city stand buildings from the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and modern times. Roman stones and bricks were often reused. Much was excavated and preserved. The sarcophagus of Caius Ateius Valerius. Cupids, tiny love gods that emerge again in the Early Renaissance as "putti." These cupids were excavated in Ivrea at a time when such sites were not amply investigated or recorded. Today these Roman sculptures are in the Museo Civico in Ivrea. But the museum has been closed for renovation since 1986. The city has had financial issues since the Olivetti factory had to dismiss the majority of its employees and workers. The gem of the Museo Civico, the "groma" pillar, is often on the move and is lent to museums the world over. It just returned from Edinburgh and is being unpacked with great care. It is the stele of the land surveyor Aebutius Faustus. A groma was a Roman surveying instrument, a cross with lead weights hanging from it. It was used to build streets, bridges, and cities. The Roman Marcus Nipsus described the groma well, but this is the only visual representation of one. In San Bernardino church on Olivetti grounds we find Spanzotti's Life of Christ fresco, with depictions of the torments of hell beneath it. "I believe there are three classes of fear: want, sickness and violence inflicted by those stronger. The most dreaded is the threat of violence from powerful neighbors. For it is accompanied by great outcry and uproar. But the natural evils I have mentioned, want and sickness, steal upon us silently with no shock or terror to the eye or to the ear. The other evil comes in the form of a huge parade surrounded by a retinue of swords, fire and chains and a mob of wild beasts to be let loose upon the entrails of men. Picture to yourself the prison, the cross, the rack, the hook, and the stake they drive through a man until it protrudes from his throat. Think of limbs torn apart by chariots driven in opposite directions, of the shirt smeared and interwoven with inflammable material, and all the other contrivances devised by cruelty not mentioned. It is not surprising if our greatest terror is such a fate, for it comes in many shapes and its paraphernalia are terrifying. Just as a torturer accomplishes more if he displays a myriad of instruments. Indeed, the spectacle overcomes those who would have patiently withstood the suffering. Similarly, of all the agencies which coerce and master our minds, the most effective are those which can make a display." Seneca: MORAL LETTERS TO LUCILIUS The Roman San Lorenzo Church at the mouth of the valley high above the Dora River. A Roman building once stood on this sunny lookout point. A temple or a villa. The church's natural stone wall incorporates reused roman bricks. A roof on the north side is covered with Roman roofing tiles. From 37 to 30 BC Vergil wrote the Georgics, an epic poem about agriculture and nature, but also war and peace. Perhaps it was conceived as a handbook for retired soldiers who were allotted land in conquered, depopulated areas. "With fresh-sprung foliage, spare them we must still so delicate, and while tendril glad flings itself up to catch the breeze, with reigns slacken'd sped through clear sky itself must not be yet assail'd with hook's edge, but cropp'd must be the leaves with talon'd hands and pick'd between. Next, when they have clasp'd the Elms with stems robust and sailed forth, strip their tresses, their arms shear close, ere they dread the steel, then, finally, exert thy tyrant rule. Fetter close their boughs all wildly floating." On this 230-year-old map the only road at the time in lower Aosta Valley ran from Pont-Saint-Martin to the city of Aosta, almost exactly as the Romans had built it. On this Via consolare delle Gallie the Romans had military encampments, mansiones, or postal stations, mutationes, where horses were changed. From the city of Aosta, the Roman Augusta Praetoria, two Roman roads led out to mountain passes. One leading north, one leading west. But the Aosta Valley begins at the town Pont-Saint-Martin. Here, over the wild brook Lys, a Roman bridge stands fully intact. All the traffic in the valley passed over it for nearly 2,000 years. The span of the arch is nearly 117 feet. No one could accept that it was the work of men, especially not of Roman heathens. The legend of Saint Martin of Tours arose. On his way to Rome he had to cross the raging stream, so he asked the Devil to build a bridge overnight. In return, he offered the Devil the first soul that should cross the bridge in the morning. After the Allied bombings on August 23, 1944, houses were destroyed but the bridge stood. The pilots had been ordered to destroy bridges and streets. Exiting the neighboring village of Donnas, a 656-foot-long track of road begins that Roman street builders chiseled into the mountain face. Ruts from Roman wagons are still clearly visible. At the time, the Dora often flooded the whole valley floor so they had to build the road higher up. They cut it into the rock, here along the cliff. The mountain face has become unstable. Due to falling rocks, the route was closed a few years ago and covered with plastic sandbags. Now the bare rock floor is being exposed again. Loose boulders high up on the cliff face were fastened with long rods. An illustration from 1853 of the road near Donnas shows how high the floodwaters once reached. Back then only horse wagons and ox carts drove here. A rural road, a railway and a highway now pass right next to the road. The milestone on the left and the archway are remnants of the mountainside left intact by the Romans when they chiseled out the road. After Donnas, the valley narrows and curves. Here, Fort Bard perches atop of a massive bluff. It was a strategic location even before the Romans. In Bard, directly next to the road, there is a Roman arch, weathered and exposed to car exhaust. In the village, about 330 feet down the road, is the Bar del Ponte restaurant. In the dining room there is another Roman arch that is protected from the elements and from exhaust. In the neighboring village of HÃ´ne Gino Daguin has a sculpture studio in his basement. He works with soapstone, a talc-schist that has been carved into vessels in Aosta Valley since at least the early Stone Age. In the 19th century, soapstone was used to carve rounded ovens and fireplaces, but also small figures, bowls and inkwells. "Canal workers, day laborers. This is the man who diverts the water. The others are cleaning. He doesn't feel like working. These men are clearing boulders from the canal. This one's working, and the shortest guy under there... They got the shortest guy to clean out the canal." The valley widens after Bard, but narrows again at the steep slopes of Montjovet, and the highway disappears into one of the many tunnels of Aosta Valley. Romans didn't build their road at valley level. They built it on the mountainside. Back then, Aosta Valley was completely covered in forest. Ivo Ferrero is an archaeologist and writer who lives in Ivrea. He walks with friends Stefano and Giorgio along parts of the Roman road on Montjovet. "This is where the Roman engineers began to solve the problem. This cliff, formed at a diagonal by the glacier, shows obvious signs of workmanship. It was obviously a natural trench. The Romans constructed shafts and tunnels to widen natural bottlenecks. This passage must've been much narrower. The Romans widened it to fit their modes of transport. The ground has changed. All that remains are the signs of workmanship on the rock. The road led up from the valley at a consistent gradient, reached this pass and crossed it. It was a problem for everyone. Aosta Valley had been used as a passage since the end of the Stone Age, for millennia before Christ, so this pass had always been a problem. Here are more signs of workmanship. Extremely precise chisel work. Crossing this pass on Montjovet was a problem for all previous cultures that used the Aosta as a corridor. Archaeological findings indicate a very old path that may have been used thousands of years before the Romans. It led over that mountain, continued behind it then down into the valley that now leads to Ussel Castle. It probably began down there near the hamlet of Fusei. There they discovered a cemetery in the early 1900s with Stone Age and Bronze Age graves. That was the oldest path. This pass made it obsolete. It ran at a higher elevation rather than at valley level, where the Dora, then a raging river, presented even greater difficulties. We don't know if this reconstruction is correct. The road surface is no longer the Roman one. Here is another interesting section of the Roman road. We just left the village of Balmas and walked down from Montjovet. These are ruts from Roman wagons. The chiseling here is very precise as well. As we continue on we see that the road widens but not parallel to the wagon ruts. The road was widened so two wagons could pass here going in opposite directions. Here is one wheel rut. Here's another and another. There was probably another over here that is no longer visible. But are they ruts from use? Or is it something else? First they thought it was from use, but then they wondered: why just these ruts and not several? It's quite possible they were grooves to make driving easier. They were chiseled into the rock and then polished with use. It worked because all Roman wagons were the same width, like train cars. Slightly more than three feet. So it was possible to stay on the right path. Of course, the original ridges were rounded with use. Let's look at more Roman craftsmanship on the way to the village of Toffo." "The slope of the road is very even thanks to the skill of Roman engineers. This chapel is obviously Christian, but the Romans had cult sites by the road, too. It's possible there was a herm here. A statue of a pagan patron God of travelers. More wagon ruts. Here is one that sparkles in the light because of the type stone. Signs of workmanship on the rock. Look at the modern wall, built because of the terraces. It's closer to the edge than the inside of the Roman road leading this way. It was wider, and broke off at some point." Above the Roman road and in the side valleys were the even older mule paths of the Salassi people. They were often steep, had steps and were impassable by wagon. This path next to the small bridge Ponte di Morreta is called Salassi Path, but no one knows when it was built. In the mountains of Aosta Valley there is a lot of loose rock and debris. Rock avalanches often obscured the painstakingly built paths, buried them or cut them off. The Salassi used artificial avalanches in combat against the Romans invading the valley. Not until Emperor Augustus did the Romans fully conquer the Salassi. Sueton wrote in his emperor biographies about the god-like Augustus: "He was unusually handsome and graceful all his life, though he shunned personal grooming. He was so careless about his hair that he would have several barbers working at once. As for his beard, he now had it clipped, now shaved, while he read or wrote. His expression, in conversation or when silent, was so calm and mild that one of the leading men of the Gallic provinces admitted it had softened his heart and kept him from his design of pushing the emperor over a cliff when he had been allowed to approach him under the pretense of a conference. He had clear, bright eyes and he liked to have it thought that they held a kind of divine power. It greatly pleased him when he looked keenly at someone and they blinked as if blinded by the sun. In old age he could not see well with his left eye. His teeth were wide apart, were small and ill-kept. His hair was slightly wavy..." After Montjovet: the ruins of the Roman bridge of Saint-Vincent, covered in marble tiles. Here, the bridge ruins in 1853. At Montjovet the valley bends toward the west and then runs very straight for 17 miles to the city of Aosta. On the way to Aosta: the Roman arch of ChÃ¢tillon, well preserved below the bridge built in the Middle Ages. Aosta. Here, where the valley branches off toward Great St. Bernard Pass, in the sheltered triangle at the Buthier and Dora confluence, the Romans founded the fortress city Augusta Praetoria. The rectangular wall around the old city is still visible today. This is how the Arch of Augustus looked 300 years ago. In the early 1700s a crucifix was mounted in the arch. A Roman bridge over the Buthier, a tributary of the Dora. The bridge still stands, but the river has been diverted. The eastern gate of the Roman city: the Porta Praetoria. The pedestals of the two arches lie six feet below the road. The level of the whole ancient city lies six feet deeper. Here, a pedestal of the east gate has been exposed. The fortress city's Roman theater. They did not find much precious metal during excavation. In the early Middle Ages, the city was plundered and pillaged many times. This fragment of gold-plated bronze was found at the theater. A reconstruction of the city's forum. The corridor around the forum, divided by a stately arcade, still remains. "I am glad to learn, through those who come from you, that you live on friendly terms with your slaves. This befits a sensible and well-educated man like yourself." "They are slaves." - "Nay, rather they are men." "They are slaves." - "No, they are unpretentious friends." "They are slaves." - "They are our fellow slaves, if one reflects that fortune has equal rights over slaves and free men alike. That is why I smile at those who think it degrading for a man to dine with his slave. But why? It is only because haughty custom surrounds a householder at his dinner with a mob of standing slaves. The master eats more than he can hold, and with monstrous greed loads his belly until it is stretched and at length ceases to do the work of a belly. So that he is at greater pains to discharge the food than he was to stuff it down. All this time the poor slaves may not move their lips, even to speak. The slightest murmur is repressed by the rod. Even a chance sound, a cough, a sneeze, or a hiccup, is visited with the lash. There is a grievous penalty for the slightest breach of silence. All night long they must stand about, hungry and dumb." Seneca: MORAL LETTERS TO LUCILIUS On the map from 1769: the road from Aosta leading to the Great St. Bernard Pass. The surface of the High Alps is constantly changing, and over 2,000 years, snow, ice and rock avalanches have erased the workmanship of Roman road builders. Cows from small farms near Great St. Bernard are driven to the cattle market in Saint-RhÃ©my. Emilio escorts his animals alone. The dog keeps the cows together. Great St. Bernard Pass in 1853. It was colder in Roman times, and the pass was above the snow line. The last steep section of the old Roman road before the pass. During Augustus' reign this gully was filled with sand and stones and topped with a layer of cobblestones. Whole armies marched here, including 40,000 legionaries under General Caecina's command. From 1890 to 1892 priests oversaw excavations here. Under earth and stones, the exposed rock revealed steps and rectangular depressions for the foundation of a Roman temple, a marble pedestal and bricks and foundations of Roman buildings a few feet away. Saint Bernard on the holy hill behind the foundation of the temple. Here stood the larger of the two Roman buildings. Stefano Ghirardo reads Roman soldier Percennius' rebellious speech, as related by the historian Tacitus. "Many mistakes were made through inactivity over many years, with soldiers now old men after serving 30 or 40 years, most with bodies mutilated with wounds. There was no end to service even after discharge, but as veterans they endured the same tasks under a different name. And if anyone survived all these hardships, they were dragged off to the ends of the earth and given swamps or barren mountainsides as so-called fields. Indeed, service itself was unrewarding. Lives and bodies were reckoned at 10 asses a day. From this clothes, weapons and tents had to be paid, the cruelty of the centurions bought off and exemption from duties purchased. The beatings and the wounds, harsh winters, arduous summers, the savagery of war and tedium of peace were unrelenting! There could be no alleviation unless men entered service with a fixed contract, namely that they earn a denarius a day, that service end with the 16th year, that they should be discharged unconditionally and be paid out in the camp in which they served. Or do the praetorian cohorts who receive two denarii a day, and are sent home after 16 years face more dangers? He was not disparaging of city sentry duty. However, serving among savage tribes, he could see the enemy from his quarters. Cornelius Tacitus: THE ANNALS The view of Switzerland from the pass, and of the centuries-old "house of the dead." The Roman road from Aosta leading west to Little St. Bernard Pass was more developed than the road to Great St. Bernard Pass. Here in upper Aosta Valley, the road ran along steep slopes. Dangerous segments were secured with protective walls and rows of arches. Spanning the ravine of the wild creek Grand Eyvia: the Roman aqueduct Pont d'AÃ«l. Perhaps the water transported by the aqueduct was used in a copper or gold mine, or, perhaps, in a quarry. The state needed tons of stone blocks to build the road and to construct the city of Augusta Praetoria. In the middle of the aqueduct: the names of the investors. Water flowed through the channel on the top. For pedestrians and goods transport there was a narrow corridor with windows below the channel. This structure has stood unchanged for over 2,000 years. Only the walls of the channel above were later restored. The upper valley is famous for it's good apples. After widening near the city of Aosta, the valley narrows again and slopes upwards. Near the village Runaz, another route is cut into the mountainside: la Pierre TaillÃ©e. This section of Roman road was used till the end of the 1800s. At the turn of the century it was replaced by the Strada Nazionale, blasted into the mountain below. The same location in1853, seen from the other direction. The Dora flows far below. Here is the Strada Nazionale, now closed. And above it, the Roman road reinforced by walls. The mountainside shifted. Sections of both roads fell into the depths. The tunnel of the new highway below the Roman road. Deeper within the mountain, trucks rumble through the tunnel. Leading away from this section of the Roman road is an even older path, perhaps from prehistoric times. The crossing to France at Little St. Bernard Pass. "We're in the ruins of the Roman mansio of Little St. Bernard. Travelers stayed here and found shelter especially in weather like we're having today. The ruins may not be very impressive, but this was once a huge building. As you can see, the building was complex, with many rooms. There were surely stables for horses and various services. A kind of motel. This is a piece of the Roman roof. Part of the structure that collapsed. That is all that's left of the Roman roof. Let's take a look at where they're excavating. We see the current excavation site and the cross-section displaying the different layers. This piece of column has been exposed with other items in another sector of the excavations." A silver bust of Zeus, found at Little St. Bernard Pass. The so-called Jupiter Column made of marble. It was buried in the ground, erected again and adorned with a carved saint. "Germanicus called a meeting of troops to discuss clever precautions and other items appropriate for the coming battle. Not just the open country favored the Roman soldier in battle, so did woods and forest glades, if shrewdly used. The barbarians' huge shields and oversized spears were not as effective amidst tree trunks and undergrowth as the Roman javelins, swords, and body-hugging armor were. They should strike repeatedly, aim their sword tips at the face. The Germans had no breastplates, helmets or iron or leather reinforced shields. They carried only wicker structures or flimsy painted boards. The first line was equipped with some kind of spears, the rest had only short javelins hardened by fire. While their physique presented a grim spectacle and was effective for brief attacks, they could not bear wounds. With no thought of disgrace nor concern for their leaders they would run from the field, panic-stricken in defeat and oblivious to law, human or divine, in moments of success." The Roman church and cloister of Sant'Orso in Aosta. The valley was under the influence of French culture for 600 years. Capitals of the Sant'Orso cloister from the first half of the 12th century. In the village Ãpinel, in a side valley of Cogne, woodcarver Dorino Ouvrier has his workshop. He was a shepherd boy as a child. He often carved wood with his knife. Then he became a bricklayer, and later a machinist, then a car mechanic. He started carving when he was 27 years old. What kind of wood is that? "A walnut root that I'm carving into two thrashers." Do you follow the original shape? "The wood has a natural shape that I follow. There's a movement in it that I liked." So the shape gives you the idea? "Sure. The shape often inspires the idea. I thought the shape would work for the idea, so now I'm trying it." Dorino Ouvrier speaks an old French dialect. French remains the primary language in the Italian Aosta Valley. Art dealers are interested in his sculptures. They are sent off to Turin, to Rome, Munich, New York and Tokyo. That's fine with him. He earns well. His wife runs a restaurant in the region's largest city, Cogne. His works are exhibited and sold there. What interests him is what hides within a towering root, what he can carve out of it. He carved "The Dairy," La Laiterie, a few years ago. "This guy arrives with the milk. He carries the milk to the dairy in a 'brenta.' Here is a man at a scale, taking down the amount. Here you see a weight being placed on the Fontina cheese to press it, and the 'gerla' to transport the Fontina. It's all a scene at the dairy." Lately he's been carving larger-than-life figures. This is also the rootstalk of a walnut tree: hard, tough wood. The shape reminds him of Christ on the cross. But a completely different figure could emerge. He's not sure yet. It will become clear as he works the wood. He has always stuck to one theme: hard-working farmers in the countryside. The kind he knew from his childhood. At the heart of Issogne is a castle of the same name built on the ruins of a Roman villa. The frescoes in the courtyard arcade depict scenes from around 1490. Everyday life in Aosta Valley more than 600 years ago. A guardhouse filled with heavy drinking and games. The graffiti was added over several centuries. At the end of the long table: a scene of murder and jealousy. From her bedroom, Countess Marguerite could access her oratory, its walls adorned with frescoes of the Annunciation and the martyrdom of St. Catherine and St. Margaret. StÃ©phanie is telling the story of beautiful Philiberte, daughter of Count RenÃ© de Challant, who spent most of his days at war fighting alongside the Dukes of Savoy. "She was the count's favorite daughter, and he made her his sole heir, although in the 15th century only sons had rights to titles and lands. The Count had promised her to nobleman Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric Madruce. But her heart belonged to a stable boy named Michel. On the day she was to be married, she disappeared. As the legend goes, she and her lover climbed out her window with a rope. Philiberte's sister Isabelle married noble Madruce in her place. The father disinherited Philiberte, and made his second daughter his heir. Her mother Mencia de Portugal died of worry. A few years later, after the death of her beloved husband, Philiberte returned to Issogne and married the much older Count Joseph Tornielli. After losing her beloved Michel, Philiberte never wanted to fall in love again. She sought only security and protection." The fresco of St. George in the courtyard of FÃ©nis Castle was painted by Giacomo Jaquerio from 1413 to 1414. FÃ©nis was also property of the powerful counts of Challant. VerrÃ¨s Castle, perched on the windswept entrance to the side valley of Challand. In some villages near Gressoney a medieval German dialect is spoken, in others, French and Italian. In the village Gaby is a very old house with supporting columns. Basket weaver Nicco Angelo lives here. His craft is older than Emperor Augustus' empire. "It's done." In the Georgics the poet Virgil wrote of the country youth: "Him not the people's fasces, not monarch's purple e'er hath made swerve, and discord faithless brothers scourging on, or from the leagued Ister pouring down the Dacian. Not th' estate of Rome and realms hasting to ruin, nor hath he grieved pitying the helpless, or with evil eye gazed on him that hath. What fruitage boughs, what by themselves in willingness the fields of their own choice have born him, hath he cull'd. Nor iron laws of man, and the mad forum, nor people's courts of record, hath he seen. Others with oars the murky fruits are vexing, and rush on steel, pierce into halls and portals of monarchs, one assails to root them out, his city and sad Penates, from a gem that he may quaff, and sleep on Sarrane purple. Stores up his wealth another, and broods o'er deep-buried gold. One stands in awe amaz'd at Rostra, one with gaping mouth applause, for through the benches peal on peal it rolls, both of the mob and nobles. The joy, deep-drenched in brothers' blood, and homes for exile and lov'd thresholds change, and seek a country lying 'neath a stranger sun. The swain with beaked plough the earth hath stirr'd and parted. Hence the travail of the year: hence fatherland, and infant progeny supports he, hence his herds of kine, and steers deserving. Nor comes rest, but the year either with apples gushes forth, or young of cattle, or the sheath of cereal culm, and furrows loads with produce, and outswells his granges. Come hath winter, bruised is now the Sicyons berry in his olive mills. Gladden'd with mast his swine return. The woods yield arbutes. And its various fruits doth autumn lay at his feet." "When right and wrong are shifted, so many wars throughout the globe, so many forms of crime, no rev'rence unto the ploughshare paid. Scurf'd lie our fields, their tillers all withdrawn, and curved sickles into grisly swords are forg'd. From this point war Euphrates, from that Germania. Cities linked by bonds of vicinage, all compacts burst, are bearing arms. And Mars maddens in godless crime o'er the globe. As when the four-yoke cars have burst like torrents on the course they gain. Straining in vain the bridling curbs, the charioteer with his steeds is swept, nor does the car give ear unto his reins." "For one basket, you have to split off ten of these hazelnut sticks." "Done." The side valley of Gressoney ends at the massif of Monte Rosa. Daniele reads a poem aloud in the Walser dialect of Gressoney. A Dark Path by Irene Alby Tregsch. A Dark Path A long footbridge A high wall The plums are sour Behind it two children play pimpiripin You have nothing I have a friend from ZÃ¶in He lives far away but I await him now He is dressed nicely We are doing a dance But the hay is still high We are not allowed There are people who watch us We cannot begin We must part without embracing I greet you You greet me We meet tomorrow Yonder behind the Horn. There is no one to watch us there We will see each other tomorrow We have lost each other On a dark path Over a long footbridge" Erika reads My Garden by Margherita Scaler. "My garden is not grand nor great And the flowers in it Are everyman's flowers Yet when I come home Dejected and annoyed Their cheery sight Warms my heart through A rosebush growing there So long already White, dear carnations Margerite With the furtive, wise wort And the herbs All peaceful together My garden is not noble Nor great I cannot praise it To the haughty Those who do not shun A simple lot Should come to my garden" Gabriele reads Very Close by Irene Alby Tregsch. "How I love to sit very close to you So close that I feel your warmth So close that I hear your heartbeat I love to fall asleep on your knees To close my eyes and be small again Love to listen to you tell stories How I love to curl up Like to lose myself in dreams Love having my nest in this tree How I love waking next to you Eyes still full of stars The sunshine of your joy in my heart" The cast iron fountain in Cogne. Even the Salassi mined iron ore here, and then the Romans did. They used to pull the heavy ore down 6,500 feet to the valley on sleds. From the turn of the century until World War I, Aosta Valley was especially poor. Young people emigrated to France and Switzerland. Even children found work as chimney sweep helpers, for example. Farewell, valley, beloved hills, azure streams Meadows, fields and forest Farewell too to the one who brings tears to my eyes Farewell, farewell, for the very last time They say it's my motto More clothing than a shirt And so many rats Sweep here, sweep there The whole chimney from top to bottom The whole chimney from top to bottom I will go forth on Pentecost I will go forth on Pentecost And on the Feast of Saint Maurice I'll be glad to return And on the Feast of Saint Maurice I'll be glad to return It's growing dark A storm is on its way Farewell, I must be going my dear village, my beloved home The Gran Paradiso, an over 13,000-foot-high mountain and national park in which the flora, fauna and landscape are protected. Erwin Monterin was caretaker of a mountain lodge here for years. He wrote: "Look from the mountain to the valley Look at the forest and the meadow Look at the deep dark shadow On the summit the sun still shines Now it fades on the mountainside Before long it will be night"
