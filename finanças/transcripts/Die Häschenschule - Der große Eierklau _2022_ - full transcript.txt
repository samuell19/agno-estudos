Soon it'll be over. Only a few days until Easter. Ladies, we have to finish the eggs by tomorrow. So, focus, everyone. The final push! -Final push! -Hurry up! -Concentrate! -Keep going! I can't wait til Easter I'm on it! Madame Hermione has already started. The Golden Egg will now choose the Master Rabbits. Shush! When I grow up, my leaf will be on the Golden Egg, too. Please, please, please! That's your leaf, Louise. Yippieh! How nice. Andy... I knew it. And Emmy. And Max too? The city rabbit? Mr. Ego rabbit... The golden egg has chosen. Hey Ron! I got mail from the Rabbit Academy! I'm a Master Rabbit candidate! Only the best of the best get a chance! What's that about? Master rabbits are bad-ass. They protect the Easter Rabbits. It's so cool! They make sure every kid gets all of their Easter eggs. Nice. Can I have one too? You betcha. Catch ya later. The name's Rabbit, Master Rabbit. Master of Easter. Max, the Master Easter Ra... Hey! Loser, you can't walk here. Got no eyes in your head? We're about to go live. With a Shockwave-rabbity stunt. Isn't that... Leo? The leader of the Shockwave Rabbits? We're now a virtual gang. This is the first livestream for our followers. And showtime! Hey, bunny buddies. Welcome to the Shockwave Rabbits' shocking action show. Remember: If you like what you see... leave us a like! Darn... What's up now? Sorry, bunny buddies. Teeny tiny digital disaster. The craziness continues shortly! Sorry, I'm out of here. Hey, hey, hey! You screw up my shot and think you can get away with it? No way, Jos√©! But I have to go. I'm being fitted for braces. You're gonna need false teeth in a minute! Let me go! Is that bandana wrapped too tight? She said she has to leave. And that's your problem, because... Sorry, but anyone who picks on little rabbits is not a Shockwave Rabbit... more of a shocking loser. Just you wait, you wimp. The Disappearius, it's an old Easer Rabbit trick. You're an Easter rabbit? So you've been to Rabbit Academy! And soon I'll be a Master Rabbit. Dream on, you dummy bunny. They've never let a city rabbit be a Master Rabbit before. Then... I guess I'll be the first. Are you out of your mind? Get off my bike! I'm only borrowing it Get out of my way! -Hey, give me back my bike right now! -No can do! You'll get it back by Easter Sunday! Woah, man. That's what I call a stunt. Crap. We've been online the whole time. Delete it! Delete it now! How? It was a live stream. Man, all paws down. Hey Sandy, can you get that drone fixed by tomorrow? Sure. Should work. Hey, bunny buddies. Upgrade your life by subscribing to our channel. Part Two of our live stream's coming up on Easter Sunday... The Shockwave Rabbit's revenge! Did you forget how to hop while you were in the city? Emmy! Max! What's that? That's the Master Rabbit Superbike! Superbike? That rickety old turnip? Bet you can't catch me! There and there, and there and there. Traps everywhere! It'll work perfectly. Soon Easter will be ours. How does it work? Paws off! Pay attention: Imagine I'm an Easter Rabbit. I'll take it! It's mine now. Okay, Mom, so you're hopping around with the eggs on your back. Then, you see this egg over here. What are you gonna do with it? No! You pick it up. Because you think that your Easter buddy has lost it. But then... Mom Don't! Yeah... And voila. We now have the Easter eggs and can go hide them ourselves. I smell Easter Rabbits. Easter Roast! Easter Roast? Go get it. -Yeah! -Yes! I should re-check the rope's tension. Get me out of here. This thing is humming like an old bumblebee. And it's as slow as a city rabbit. You think? Emmy, the foxes! Hop on! Eat my dust, losers! Just you wait! What's that all about... My sweet carrot! Hold tight, Emmy! Keep your ears down! We need to sandwich them! Outta the blue and into my stew. No! No! What? You've barely just arrived, and already managed to provoke the foxes! How dare you put Emmy in danger with that thing? But I only wanted to... Make a big entrance. We get it. No, get here as soon as possible to help out with everything. By luring our enemies all the way to the gate? If you want to become a Master Rabbit you have to take responsibility. And not only for yourself. You betcha! I'm a rabbit of honor! They got away? Darn it, they out-foxed us. How will we ever become Easter foxes? If you just let those city rabbits hop all over you? This is the future. We will hide the eggs and then we will be loved. Because we're so lovable! Now it's time! Final leg- Here comes the egg! Come on, everybody, let's roll up our sleeves chickens and rabbits Hey ho here we go Let them roll guys Let's do it right Together we will paint the eggs paint the eggs! The color is ready The brushes are all set Welcome to the highest art of of coloring the eggs Let's color the world ablaze it with color spread all the joy to one another Let's make it shine Just like a rainbow Together we will let the world glow Let's color the world ablaze it with color Happy Easter everybody Let's make it shine Just like a rainbow Together we can let the world glow Let's color the world ablaze it with color Let's color the world ablaze it with colour Let's color the world How do I become a Master Rabbit, Madame Hermione? Is there a special challenge or something? Every Master Rabbit must find their own special Master Rabbit skill. Andy can reach for the clouds. Louise is drawn to things distant, but she always comes back eventually. And Emmy is fast and agile like the wind. In order to prove yourself worthy as a Master Rabbit... ...you too must find your unique skill. It's something you contribute to the community... ...which is as unique as you are. Master Rabbit skill. Alright. Seems doable. We've been training since last Easter. What did you do in the meantime? A lot! I've been practicing as well... There's nothing city rabbits can't do. Oh boy. So that's the mountain? Yeah, that's Mount Chicken. Tomorrow, we'll steal all the eggs from up there... ...and on Easter Sunday we'll smash them. Right in front of the twitching noses of those little Easter bunnies. There may be a teeny-tiny problem with the drone... What? You won't have the drone ready? C'mon Sandy, it's not like I can carry them all down from there on foot. So we could have three more traps by Easter, and then we'd have... It's working! Hey, guys! Sorry I'm taking up all this space in this nice hole of yours. I'll be gone in a jiffy if you get me out of here. We will, don't you worry. Shush! We don't talk to food! But, roast rabbit is so out-dated. Only total idiots would eat that. That's okay. Mom always says I'm not the sharpest tool in the box! Don't eat me! I'm sick. I have the bunny pox! That's why I'm so skinny! That's right. He won't make a good roast. But he'll be just perfect in our soup! What? No! Stop! I... -I've got lice. -Extra treats. I love how they tickle your tongue. You're making a huge mistake. Easter Fox! But you want to be Easter Foxes right? And what's it to you? I can help you! I know how to get to the eggs. Why should we trust you? You're a rabbit yourself! Thanks, Captain Obvious! I even attended The Rabbit Academy. I was the best student in my year you know- at quitting. Easter rabbits are so annoying. They think they're better than everyone else. Especially better than foxes. No more of this Easter Rabbit nonsense. This Easter will be your Easter. The Best Easter ever! That's right! And the kids will cheer for us. Okay, um... With your help we could build two additional traps. And so by Easter Sunday we should be able to have at least... 14 rabbits times... Nah! Way too small-minded, Foxi! We're gonna get all the eggs at once. Right from the source. Let him explain! Great idea, but there's no way to get up Mount Chicken. Well, guess who knows all about a secret pathway to the eggs. Who? Alrighty! New Easter Gang? High five! Hey! Help! The egg! What happened? Careful! It won't come off No. The old scriptures say... If the Golden Egg turns black Easter is under attack. -Easter? -Danger? But why? It's the foxes for sure! The foxes come up with some new scheme every year. It must be something even worse this time. What? Whoever is threatening Easter... ...Is gonna have to make it past me first! -Past us! -Exactly. Past all of us! Everyone together! Calm down, calm down. We can't fight a threat unless we know what it really is. Until then, we must be vigilant. You will decorate the eggs and keep a close eye on the egg track. And you will practice your Master Rabbit skills. Easter needs you like never before. With united hearts and steady minds. Some Master Rabbit you are! Thinking only of yourself again! That's why the Disappearius won't work! Look, one more time for city rabbits. Close your eyes, forget about yourself and lose yourself in your task. The Disappearius doesn't work anymore. No! Madame Hermione! I feared this might happen. Without the magic of the Golden Egg, our powers dwindle. No. Hey, bunny buddies, quick update: our team has expanded. Now our Easter Gang is ready to roll. How about a wave to your followers! Yoo-hoo! Hello! To our what? Lots of bunnies hopping after me online. You are so last year! Okay. Once you're inside the cave, just climb upwards. The eggs are all on a big pile on the summit. Yeah, yeah. We got it the first time. Once you're up there you just need to shoo away the chicks. Put the eggs into the basket and lower them down to your mom and me. Got it? And I'm gonna color the eggs. And draw cute little worms and spiders on them. and then those kids will rip the eggs right out of my paws. Mom, Easter Rabbits hide their eggs secretly. That's part of the magic. But I want everyone to know they're from us. No sweat! Today's kids can't be fooled anyway. Hiding eggs is so lame. -But... -Be quiet! If anyone knows what kids like... ...it's gotta be someone from the big city, like Leo! Here's the way in. Go! Yeah but should we really... Which part of go did you not understand Foxi? Even without the Disappearius: We still have the magic power of our community. One Master Rabbit alone is like a twig. But if you combine your powers... ...then one strengthens all and all strengthen one. Let's all practice that now. You've got one minute to put the wooden egg into the weather vane. Sounds pretty easy! All the better. -Are you ready? -Of course! 100 percent. Against the clock and against me! On your paws, get set, go! Emmy, over here! Got it! Look out Andy! Over there. Hey! Up here, up here! C'mon! Not so fast, Max! Darn! Yeah! Andy, over here! Bravo, Emmy! Max, no! I've got it, Emmy Aww man! Max! Max? Sorry, guys, that was close. But no guts- no glory- right... We would have won, if it weren't for you and your stupid super turnip bike It's okay Emmy. I just wanted to help you and... The good news is, I've found my Master skill. I can fly! Yeah, right. Crash pilot. Emmy? What's wrong? I... I, I, I. Is that your favorite word? We're in! All the eggs come from up there! -Eggs! -Eggs! Paws off the eggs for now, got it? Does he think we're dumb? But they won't notice if it's just one, right? Yeah. Where are the eggs? Is I my favorite word? I don't think so! Hey Emmy! I... Leave me alone! I was thinking that I... Shoot! You were thinking that you... You thought, you... Look, I'm sorry! Emmy! Max! The eggs are stuck in the cave. That's the way in. Lets' stay here a minute! Where are you? Are you out of your mind? You can't just take them. Yeah, they're ours! Because they'll notice. Rabbits! The main course! Max! Bunny-rabbit, scaredy-rabbit, for dinner we'll have Easter Rabbit! Not on my watch! Madame Hermione! Not my nose, that's not fair! Hey! What are you doing? We can play that game too! I'll get you! And now for you! The foxes have... Dug a hole for themselves, it seems. What's that? That has to be ancient. Stone-age graffiti? The Power Booster! It's in the old scriptures: If you can draw your enemy near... ...and find a way to conquer fear... ...if you can trust with all your heart... ...you'll gain a strength that sets you apart! Power Booster? Awesome! Quick! We've got to get out of here! Hurry! The world is coming to an end! -Madame Hermione? -Are you hurt? Nothing to worry about. No! Rotten Celery! A few measly eggs. It's hardly worth taking the paintbrush out for them. How could you screw that up again? That was a super-loony show-off-rabbit plan. But nobody ever listens to me. Ey Sandy, these brush tails are complete idiots. This will be a total disaster. You've got to hurry up. I need that drone! I can't wait to see their dumb faces... ...when we smash the eggs on Easter Sunday. Smash the eggs? You miserable liar! Hey! Stop! That's mine! Mom! -Listen to this! -Stop it, Foxy. -Give that back, Dangrabbit! -Mom, Mom! Leo doesn't actually want to help us become Easter Foxes! Why else would I be going through all this trouble? Mom, he's lying. Listen to this. -Claws off! You'll scratch my screen! -Nice! What a vixen! Real sweet. The Easter Gang rocks! The foxes are awesome. Hey! She's talking about us. Any questions? But Mom! Please believe me! This is Easter we're talking about! That's exactly why I want to get on with painting these eggs. But he's lying! Leo just wants to destroy the eggs! One more mean word about Leo and you'll be spending the night outside! Those darn foxes. They're after my eggs? We will stop them. Alright. But you'll have to carry all my dear little eggs downhill. And you'll have to make it snappy! So you can paint them before Easter. Okay... Hey, with this Power Booster thingy... ...we'll be done in two shakes of a bunny tail! Come on, Emmy, let's try it. How did it go again? I remember! If you can trust with all your heart... ...you'll gain a strength... -That sets you apart! -That sets you apart! The Power Booster is a legend from a time... ...long before the Golden Egg came to be. No one knows if it ever really existed. But who would etch that picture into the wall if it was just a fairy tale? you coming? Tell me, how did you find your Master skill? It was just suddenly there- during training. We were all good at something different. And you can't become a Master Rabbit without a Master skill? But you still have a few days. If Easter ever happens... Emmy, we have to go into the forest. I know it's dangerous without the Disappearious... but we need to find out what plot the foxes are hatching. Like secret agents. Did you really just say we instead of I? Does that mean we're a team? They're getting some shut eye! They're counting some sheep! Why? They're sleeping... Why didn't you just say so. What's kind of a track is that? Stylo biker boots! Last season's! -Someone from the city? -Someone from the city? The foxes got into a... It's you again. Yes, we wanted... -To chill out a bit. -Forest air, you know. Ferdinand? Wait a second... Paws off! But I've got to tell you something. Hello? Nothing to worry about, Mom. Go back to sleep. You caught a rabbit! I wish. That rabbit is in charge here now. He wants to steal your eggs. Who is he talking to? Go have a look, Bruno. I'll tell you everything. But we've got to get out of here. With you? I don't trust you one bit! Then stay here and get eaten by my brothers. I smell rabbit meat. I think I'll go with the first option! Where? Over there! He's chasing two rabbits. Without us? Come on! Ferdi, we're coming! I'll go get Madame Hermione! Stop right there! A fox on Academy grounds? Are you out of your mind, Max? Just a second Mr. Fitz. Stay back, Emmy! A rabbit wants to help you become Easter Foxes? Yes! But Leo is trying to trick us. Leo? The Leader of the Shockwave Rabbits gang? With lots of piercing? We had a Leo here once. He was the worst student we ever had We never managed to make him feel like he was part of our community. Callously, he left a classmate in a trap in the forest. We were lucky that we found him in time That sounds just like him. And now he's up to something really awful He's gonna steal all the Easter eggs and destroy them! -What? -What? But my Mom doesn't believe me. She thinks Leo is some big hero who'll make all her dreams come true. I would love to be an Easter Fox, too. But if Leo destroys the eggs, there'll be no Easter at all. Not for anyone. And that's why you wanted to warn us? So that you'd know who really wants to destroy Easter. Cause it's not me. If nobody at home believes you... -Why don't you stay with us? -Emmy! We could sure do with some help, too? But not from a fox! Why not? Sometimes embracing your enemy is the best way to gain a friend. Or a fox claw in your back. Hermione! This is getting out of hand. First a city rabbit, and now a, a fox... Yeah, but he seems completely different to the other foxes! If you really want to help us save Easter, then you're welcome. For real? You believe me? Yeah, I swear, I only want what's best for Easter. But keep your paws off the rabbits. If you as much as put a finger on them... ....you'll be a fur coat before you could say 'rabbit stew'! I won't hurt any of you. Believe me. I promise. And we still have a spare bed. But... Coming? But I... I'm Emmy, by the way. I'm Ferdinand but you can call me Ferdi! You know Leo from the city? I borrowed his bike once, one time. But without him wanting me to. So I annoyed him a little I guess... you know... So you took it without asking... And now he wants to get back at all Easter Rabbits and, and destroy Easter! And now you think it's all your fault. I think it all started way before this, here at Rabbit Academy. But that doesn't matter now. The important thing now is that we stop Leo. Yeah. A fox in here? That's insane! I bet it was your idea. No. It was mine. Don't worry. He won't do anything. At least, that's what he promised. Should we keep a night watch? Okay, you scaredy-rabbits, I'll do it. You guys would all fall asleep anyway. The city never sleeps, so I'm used to it. You see? All fine and dandy. Gee, am I hungry. Here you go! This salad stuff is yummy. Enjoy! Why don't you go vegan? It's the big thing in the city. Let's go! Hop, hop! The eggs are waiting. And you two, go and meet Hermione at the cave. Or what's left of it. What? Are we really supposed to repair the egg track? All alone? Well, there are two of you. Well, yeah, you're right, but me and him? I mean... I'm busy. I need to find my Master Rabbit skill. Who knows. Maybe it will find you. Man, this is all your fault! No! It's gonna take ages to fix all this. Not when you have the cleverest engineer in the whole wide forest. A clever fox? Okay, I'll decide what to do, and you do the rest! May the egg be with you. Okay. On three! One, two... Orpington? What? It's called an egg? Really? And from what breed of hen? An Easter hen? That's not a breed. Could you stop babblering and give me a helping paw here? That Power Booster would be good now. Power... what? It's an ancient superpower. You have to trust someone with all your heart, and boom. You're suddenly strong. But not even Hermione knows if it ever actually worked. Never mind. It weighs around 58 grams. Could be from a Brahma hen too though. You do know what the word work means, right? I am working. I'm thinking. Maybe a Leghorn? Or a Burford Brown? You think those two could become a team? A Fox and a Rabbit? Impossible. Seemingly impossible things have already happened. A rabbit has joined forces with the foxes to ruin Easter. And the Golden Egg has lost its magic. Perhaps now a fox will have to join forces with a rabbit to save Easter. It's more likely that I'll dance the tango with a fox. -You have no idea about science! -You idiot. You're not helping! -I can't work like this! -You're just so annoying! You call yourself a Shockwave Rabbit and you can't even fix a lousy drone? I need that thing by Easter Sunday at the latest. Try harder, darn it! Here I am working my tail off and my own son goes off with the rabbits? Ferdinand. The only one who inherited my brains. I spoiled him too much. Well, one thing is clear: Ferdinand is both a coward and a traitor! But we're gonna swipe the eggs anyway. We'll build steps and climb right to the top of the mountain, heh. Pretty clever- for a rabbit! You don't happen to have long nails, do you? We have everything. It's only two more days till Easter. We'll never make it with just the three of you. The mountain is too steep for the little ones. We're working as fast as we can. Well just be careful with them! Treat them like babies! It's no surprise there are no Easter foxes... ...if all the brushtails are slackers like you. Listen, bunny. I'm doing some intellectual heavy lifting here. While you're just whipping around your ridiculous rubber paw. This is a slimy hand. And I know how to use it. Right, to wipe your slimy nose with it? A fox? On Mount Chicken? Gerda! Don't worry! Dear scrambled eggs! This fox is on our side. At least that's what he says... His name is Ferdinand. and you? Wait a minute, you're a... A common mountain chicken? Gotta problem with that? No! You lay the best eggs in the world. With a particularly strong shell. Well, of course I do! And why didn't anybody tell me earlier? Your eggs are absolutely top-notch! Now, I can finally get started. Hold on, Professor Chicken. We're supposed to work together... If I need help, I'll let you know! Now that's what I call a clever fox! That's so nice! He's sending me hopping mad! Did you hear him? I this, I that... Sounds familiar, somehow. What? Are you crazy? What do you think you're doing? What does it look like? I'm fixing the egg track. No? I'm fixing the egg track. I think that could work. Of course it will work. My ideas always work! What a gasbag. All talk and no action. Thinks he knows it everything about everything. Come on, why won't you budge? No way! You've got to be kidding! You just slimeballed your way in to destroy our eggs! -No, I... -So? Is it working? Isn't this a fabulous, egg-flingy-thingy? Um, well... No, my egg! My Crowing Rooster! It doesn't have enough power to shoot it all the way to the red blanket. So much for the greatest engineer? But don't you fear. Max The Master Rabbit is here! Pull hard, you weakling of a fox! I already am, dummy-bunny. Max! Push, together! that was easier than I thought. Hey, guess you're a strong fox after all! And you're a clever bunny Hand me the wrench please. Thanks. Okay, and now tighten it up. Fits perfectly. -Alright. -Great. Then I'll turn it on. Okay, all set! Awesome! Another one down the drain. Don't worry. We just need to tighten it. Alright... Give it another shot! Gerda! Now, stop firing my eggs around. We're trying to save them not make omlettes! Okay. Flight path equals discharge speed times... Just use your instinct! Paws off! Stop! It won't work without calcu... Alright! Good job, fellas. Hey, what are you two doin? Looks like it needs a little lift. Yeah, it's working. Awesome! That one should do it. Listen up. Tell Gerda she can start the egg track as soon as we give the signal, okay? Got It! But that one's too heavy for us. We managed to lift the bike before, didn't we? It's easy! No, way? The Power Booster! The what? This badass thing I was telling you about. It gives you a lot of strength... ...if you're willing to trust someone with you all your heart. I think we're doing it! Yeah right, that's baloney! Would have been too good to be true. We'll never get all the eggs off the mountain by tomorrow. It's simply impossible. Dear sweet carrot! Have they completely lost their minds? What on earth? Astonishing. Truly astonishing. And you worked this out all alone? Alone? Time to clean your glasses. We're a team! Absolutely! What was that about dancing the Tango with a fox? Simply incredible. Can I go training again now? Come on, I'll show you some cool moves! Yeah! Can you show me that Disappeari-thing? Or is it something only rabbits can do? That's not the actual problem. -Max! I wanted to see if... -I wanted to show the egg to Ferdinand. The egg lost its color because Leo and my mom ganged up against the Rabbits? And it will only ever shine again if Easter is saved. And then hopefully the Disappearius will work again, too. Guys, C'mon we gotta save Easter! -Together! -Together! Yes, together! What's that? Nothing. It's private. Leave him alone. Don't be so nosy. I have to go- to keep watch on Mount Chicken. I'll go pick up the tools, okay? Come on, people! Get a move on! I need those things this Easter! Idiot! The trap! Easter roast, at last! False alarm! It'll work perfectly. Yeah right. Ferdi is all talk. Yeah, you can say that again. Well? Not even an itty-bitty little mouse roast. Do have happen to have any more of these? We have everything. Ruth, you're the most brilliant Easter fox ever! Let's call it a night soon. And all is quiet. Oh my! Here comes trouble! The foxes are attacking us! Help! The foxes! Oh no! Oh no! The foxes! What are they up to? They're stealing the eggs! Oh no! They've almost reached the top! We must stop them! I'm gonna help Emmy! Me too! Let's go! -My goodness! -No, no! That's it! The paint bags! Hey, bunny buddies, soon the Easter Rabbits will be history. Hello... Watch it, will ya? I got you! Still on top of things. Dimwit. Just you wait, I'll get you! They've almost reached the top! Over here, quick! Put it in here! Put the paint bag in the basket! And fire! Darn! Climb around it! It's slippery. Watcha doing? We've got them on the run! And fire! Gotcha! That's not fair! Hurry up! But climb around the paint! Bruno, what's wrong now? Look! Okay, one against three. That's no problem for a Master Rabbit. No honey, it's two against three. We're almost there! Give it all you've got. Yeah! Higher! We have to aim the paint directly above them! Ferdi, where have you been? I... And fire! Great idea. Go again, c'mon! Let's give it a shot! There, that's better! Now it's ready! Everyone clear! And Fire! Get lost, you egg thieves! Emmy! My gosh! Emmy, I'm coming! Let go of me! Emmy, grab on! Emmy! No! Poor Emmy! Emmy! Stay right there, Miss Fluffly tail. Get your paws off of me! -Emmy's alive! -Quick! Let's go get her! Yeah, we'll help her! Hello! Coochy, coochy, coo! Let go of her! Max, don't! Look it's the wannabe Master Rabbit. And my old teachers. Mr. Fitz is it? And you haven't changed one bit, Madame Hermione. Apparently, neither have you. Yeah yeah long time no see. Well, if only you hadn't kicked me out back then... You have to save Easter! Let Emmy go immediately! -I can deal with these guys. -Gladly. Tomorrow morning, as soon as the sun comes out over Mount Chicken. Just in time for Easter. In exchange for all your Easter Eggs. But please make sure they're well painted, yeah? You can forget about that! Stop! No! You'll only put Emmy in danger. And yourself. If you lay a single claw on me... ...your cute little friend over there will be fox fodder. Without the Disappearius, we don't stand a chance. They won't hurt Emmy as long as we have the eggs. So we'll keep painting them for now! But... Please, Max. Let me think things through. We will find a way. Come on. Let's go paint the eggs! Easter isn't over until it's over. Where were you when the attack started, by the way? I... I had something to do. Isn't that- you were in the forest! Of course. With the rest of your family! No! Well yes, I was in the forest, but I... You gave them the idea to climb up the mountain with these things! -No! -The greatest engineer, huh? Always has a brilliant idea up his sleeve! But I... no! I only... They caught Emmy all thanks to you! Disarmed my traps. You threw that paint bomb right at Emmy's feet! What? You think I did that on purpose? Why not? You're such a genius, after all. You calculated everything. Probably from the beginning! You act like the cuddly fox... ...scout everything out and then it's run back to Mom to prepare the attack. You think I'd do such a thing? But, you said Trust someone with all your heart remember? I thought we were a team. I thought so too. But I guess I thought wrong. You're just as messed up as my family! So, is the drone fixed? Yeah sure, as good as new. And are you on your way? Yeah. Just Leaving. Well, get a move on then! Right right! Now they have no choice but to cough up those eggs. Thanks for that. Ferdi, sorry that I thought... I was a complete idiot. Bruno's sitting right by the door, Mom's flat out. We need a plan to outfox them. That rabbit girl just inside the door is making me hungry, it's not fair! I'll distract my brothers... And I'll get Emmy outta there. Help! Ferdi's trap! Rabbit for breakfast! Man, that was another false alarm. If Ferdi ever shows up here again, then... Then what? How dare you show up here. Someone's gonna regret this. Yes, you are! Both of you. No, I'm really getting scared. Looks like rabbit meat for breakfast after all. Wow! Get the hostage ready, it's showtime! Let's cut through the forest! You got to be kidding me! Okay, please listen up everyone. Leo and the foxes will be here any moment. As soon as we have Emmy we will... There she is! Emmy! Well done. At least for a city rabbit... Respect! -Respect! -I wanna peck you all over! I was so worried about you Emmy. What in the world is that? Happy Easter! Hi there! Oh no! My wilting cabbage. Don't they ever give up? The Easter eggs! C'mon everyone, hurry! Here they are, our Easter eggs! All ready and waiting! So, is it stream live, Sandy? Yup! We are online! Hey bunny-buddies, you're in for a real special treat. Hey, get lost!
