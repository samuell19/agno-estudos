THE BEAUTIFUL DAYS OF ARANJUEZ based on the play by PETER HANDKE And again it is summer. Again a beautiful summer day. A garden. A terrace. A woman and a man under the trees, with a gentle summer wind, as if out of time. A garden table between the woman and the man. They are sitting at a good distance. The two are also as if out of time and out of all current affairs and, even more, of any and all historical framework. Which does not mean that they are out of reality. Perhaps, it is the opposite. Let's listen. And to begin with, one and the other, without looking at each other, hear the whisper for a long time from the leaves to the summer wind. "It's as if with every whisper of the leaves if an hour passes, or a whole day". Who starts? You. It was planned that way. Yeah, it was planned that way. Your first time with a man What was it like? Look! An eagle passed through the trees like an arrow. Or was it a kite? It was a falcon. Eagles and kites circulate above the trees. It is the falcons that cross the forest like arrows. Your first night with a man? It wasn't one night. And he was not a man. And I will not become a woman. Even so it was an act of love. I made love to him and he made love to me. It was a physical, bodily union. It was a union of two bodies in one. And what a union! Tell me. I always feel like to tell this experience. But when they ask me to tell, I lose the will. Today is another day. It's a summer like never before. Maybe the last one, after all. Yes, it is summer as if it were the last time here. For the last time... For the last time... It was summer that day too. It wasn't my first night. It was my first day of love. An orchard. Grey chicken excrement and white on fresh trimmed grass. A supported wooden ladder in an apple tree? You guessed it! And had just done his 18th birthday party. Now it's wrong. I was still a child. I was only 10 years old. But he got the other part right. It was my birthday. If I am not mistaken, was a Sunday. Like any other summer Sunday. I'm just sure that I was with light party clothes. It was a long white dress and white shoes. Even the shoes were white, no jump. And I never told this to anyone, not even for me. Is that a story? "Tell me. Let's see". It was afternoon. I was on a swing somewhere in the orchard. Yes, it was an apple orchard, not cherries. There were no red stains on the my dress. Not before, not after. No memories of people close to me. Even so, there was the invisible presence of my relatives... father, mother, brothers, sisters. And I, sitting on that swing, swinging more and more free, more and more liberated from the presence of them by another presence. Slower, slower... Look! The petals of the vine flowers. How they wave floating in the wind... But it was that fast. Increasingly faster. Until at a certain moment, suddenly, at the peak, an abrupt slowdown. While the scale continued swinging with the same speed something inside me has awakened, came to life, thanks to this abrupt deceleration and then, thanks to this sudden immobility in the middle of those spheres that I would repeat in that balance, was born, opened and then exploded. I've become the thing and she turned into me. One thing? The sex? Your sex? As you prefer. But what was born in that balance, I didn't feel like if it was my own sex, but as the origin of the world. And blood came out? Why are you doing a question like that? Because it is predicted. No. No blood came out. No drop. The lightning that struck me left me unharmed. I only bled through my nose. And who was the ray that penetrated you? A god? A god of service? Why are you doing a question like that? How did you continue? You sat on the balance sheet and kept swinging? I don't know anymore. All I know... is that this instant in the balance above the foliage of the orchard, I child transformed into queen, lasted forever. It persists until today. Even if I have remained an exiled queen, the queen of another world, from a different planet... From the moment of my transformation, I was not only deprived of childhood, but also of all legitimacy of the usual world, of my planet Earth. Launched to the universe as queen of an unknown destination, I'll come down here, among my relatives, an illegal being, an outlaw. In the beginning... sweet dread. Fear accompanied by a sweetness which could not be more universal, more majestic. Then, majestic sweetness followed by a different dread: horror, terror. This apparition of the origin of the world meant the prohibition to stay from that moment on in this familiar land. Sweet dread... Unreasonable sweetness. New dread without the sweetness. Remembrance of sweetness, etc and so on. Until now. Now I remember. That beam didn't penetrate on top of me. It came from below, he emerged from the earth. And he didn't burn any of my bones. He implanted me a second vertical column, a much stronger one. And, ah... He whipped me. A lash that was the opposite of a punishment. How quiet it is here. Especially today. Since this morning. Summer is at full steam. Just before we start talking, me and you, I had, surrounded by silence, the sensation of arrival... No. No! Let's say "the fall of a silence" No! Let's say "an additional peace of mind" No! Let's say "complementary". about this region. And it wasn't just about the region. It was all over the Earth! The whole earth with this tranquility deep if sweetly transformed. Not on a disc, as you imagined in the past our ancestors. No! Let's say "in a basin". Thanks to the deep silence, the Earth gains in depth. This expression is strange: "gain in depth" Sweet illusion. Illusion, but so sweet. She was the one who directed her voice to do the first question. And surrounded by it, I gained confidence in your question. No! Let's say "in your voice". And I was able to participate in the game, I was able to answer you. And at the same time to the eagle that circulated silently high in the sky... where it continues to circulate. And if a helicopter comes on the scene with a bang? A fighter plane? A bomber? That will not happen. Not right now. What if a scream comes from your basin? This will not happen either. And if it happens, there's screaming... that accompany the calm, -that give rhythm to tranquility. -For example? And then what? How did it go with your first man in the flesh and bone? Where? When? Who? And then what? How it was with your first man in the flesh? Where? When? Who? No recollection. Neither of a bone nor of flesh, not even from man. A dark night? A stranger? Another invisible one? A stranger in the night? The Rain Passenger? It was again during the day. Another summer day, much later. Better said, a summer day out of time as only certain summer days can be. A summer day like today. And at the same time very different. It is obvious. It's not how you want to hear it. Different, mainly, the outside scene. A salt pan by the sea... No trees. Just a bush. A Mediterranean mulberry tree... with lots of red fruits raspberry shaped. Less sweet and even more tender. Underneath it... the only shadow of all extension. Usually there is a small construction of stones in the salt pans. A hut, or a hut... You are right. There was a wooden hut hidden by the mulberry tree. Now I remember. Only now. And the wood of the cabin was very light grey, almost white, as the salt in the salt pan. Whitish by very saline air, like all the small locks in wood connected to salt tanks which dries through this immense saline. The door of the cabin was locked. There were no windows. We were forced to force the door. Was he strong? We force it with a species of rail that used to serve to transport salt. The saline was half abandoned. The trail was rusty. We force the door together, without a word... as before we had caught the trail without a word, in a single movement. Had they arranged to meet in the saltworks? No. I was there, in the shadow of the mulberry tree, sitting. And when the man appeared In the distance, you soon got up. Exactly. But it wasn't the man. It was his silhouette. "The promise of silhouette..." Something like that, that. But it wasn't the man that made me get up. It was his silhouette. His silhouette in the distance promised me something. She announced a prophecy. "Silhouette" for me means "prophecy" now. She gave me wings too. Have you met him before? Ask me another question. Did it come directly in your direction? Before you see me, he was walking straight for the mulberry tree. As soon as he sees me, he stops. Then he goes in the opposite direction. -Then, after three steps... -Exactly three? Exactly three. After three steps, he turns around, against his will, driven by a greater force. Was he fascinated by you? For the woman? By your presence? Yes. Fascinated. But fascinated in another way. Not for me, for my person. Fascinated by the place first. By the extension of that saline almost abandoned there. Fascinated... No! Taken... No! Dominated by desire. Desire created... No! Generated by that powerful empty space of salt color, exhaling salt in front of him. Desire to unite right there to that void, sex in sex. To be entirely incarnated by sex. -What about you? -Like him. No difference between the man and me. No questions asked. No words. No preamble, or if you prefer, none. prelude. No game elements. Just seriousness. Seriousness, seriousness, seriousness. Strength of seriousness. Seriousness until in the common laughter of the after. Monumental. "From Her To Eternity Yes, monumental. Thanks to the place. Thanks to the place, to man and me. Why don't you ask any more? Without your questions I can't go on. I become blind and change. Thanks to your questions, I see again. No! I'll see. See what became invisible until this moment. Ask questions. It was planned that way. And what do you see in the cabin? In the lost saline hut. The light. What do you mean? See the light? We usually see with the light, or through light, or a light. Not the light itself. And the cabin had no window and the door behind you was closed. Yes, the door was closed. But there was here and there a gap between the planks. And one place was missing a knot of wood. And through this little round hole a ray of sunshine entered. There was also the shadow of the tip a blackberry leaf on the floor. And then... in his body, in my body, in our bodies. The floor of the cabin it was dirt... I can see the shadow of the leaf. The teeth of the leaves blackberry tips and at the same time curved, different from any tree leaf. Like a shadow. Single shadow. Shadow that means, as no other way, the summer. Full summer. The heart of summer. The light, that light, emanated from the floor of the cabin, of the earth even. And she was transformed, an emanation behind the other, in matter. It was transformed into fabric with which he and I were dressing. Naked, as we were, we kept getting dressed... to each ray of light. The light went up from the ground and dressed each one of us with a perfectly identical outfit and that, slowly, delicately, has become a habit of a perfection that I, at least, I had never used neither before nor after. Nor wearing the most beautiful dress and most expensive in the world. And everything happened slowly? Slowly and delicately? As in the act of undressing followed by that of getting dressed? Wasn't there a sudden moment? Sudden? Abrupt? A fleeting moment? Now I remember. Suddenly, the shadow of the leaf on the hut filled with a color. What color? Of an unknown color, without name. A dark color. Did you keep your eyes open? I don't remember. But at that moment, I ended up opening. -Before I was just listening. -The other's breath? Invalid question. I heard the noises from the salt flats and the more distant ones. Out of fear? By distraction? By inattention? Idiot! Unless you want to rip the truth out of me. The first apples are already maturing. Way ahead of other types. Not like this one. The skin and the meat of the first of summer are of pure whiteness, almost white. But in the middle, black seeds like those of no other fruit. For me, these apples incorporate the summer. The first days without school, no homework, days off. Without the weight of things to learn about the shoulders. Hands free until you get the apple. How free she was! But the first apples turned rarity, or disappeared completely. The truth is this: thanks to the location, the cabin and thanks to man, and thanks to me... my ears opened like nowhere else. My hearing turned his hearing. And what I heard was part of it of the whole, participated, became a noise here, another there, one after the other, one at the same time as the other. An instrument of that set, larger and larger, and prolonged. There, the crack of a single sheet dry in the middle of the noise of green foliage. -Ali... -And then? -We realize... -Is that right? We, that. We realize... that we had slept on a bunch of excrement. Of human shit. Old woman. Completely resected. But thanks to the saline air, well preserved in its form Undoubtedly human, even in its color. But our bodies had already... rubbed on it, even touched it. And realizing that... We both realize... that at our feet... in a pool of water of the rain that entered through the roof bumpy hut, one thing contorts itself like a giant worm, who was actually a leech. She was huge and black like a black pudding... because she had remained during all this time... sticking to the leg potato of my lover before falling satiated from his blood at the last moment. And then what? I don't know... We laughed! We laugh. Us! We laugh. For the second time. A laugh like its seriousness as before. Yes, sir. We had fulfilled the divine will. Have you become divine? Have you remained divine? For a certain moment. For a while. At least beyond of that distant summer day. And then what? We got married and we live happily. And we became less divine until the end of our days. Was all this a tale or a dream? Are you dreaming or talking? All this was true. It is true. But if you want to know, we stay together until there is no more "we Until there is no more neither man nor silhouette. Just the other. I went to Aranjuez once. Aranjuez? The famous Aranjuez? Aranjuez is a small town which is not far from Madrid. It is to the south, before Toledo. At the time, it was the summer residence of the kings of Spain. There is nothing beyond of a huge park crossed by some arms of the Tagus, the biggest river, I think, of the Iberian Peninsula. And in the middle of this park, the royal castle. I did not go to Aranjuez because of the castle, but because it existed in this same park a "Casa del Labrador the only one in the world. A unique "Farmer's House". I had to enter from any way in that house. Her name alone made me take the road. A "Farmer's House in a real park. She was not like if you could imagine hidden by the bushes, outside of the artificial landscape of the park, being part of the steppe, the Spanish natural savannah. No. On the contrary. She was in a oddly green clearing. And there, the park was much more well taken care of than near the castle. And "La Casa Del Labrador" was another castle behind the main castle. Much smaller, but more luxurious. Especially inside. No trace of worker in the rooms and rooms in marble... nor in the other rooms outside the itinerary of the visitation. No traces either of an agricultural worker. I found out too late that the name came from the frescoes that decorated the halls and rooms of the second Royal Summer Castle. They represented idyllic scenes of country life in the 17th century, such as people playing cards. Each room of the construction in bricks called "Farmers House it looked like a game room. Games and more games: chess, tarot, billiards... Nowhere were there any traces of management, better saying... What you were waiting for of this "Casa del Labrador"? First, maybe, a wooden construction. A hut, but a hut as I have never seen. A large cabin like a castle, bigger than any castle. Very big. A light like that which you just invoked. An act of love, but not like yours between the man of salt and you. The hut of times past as housing for a future, as any construction of today's times. Never seen agricultural tools, nor in museums. A tool meant for me, for me to steal and take with me into the future. And on the earth ground of that cabana-catedral, maybe, for you, a gigantic pile of shit. Not human, from bats. Not dry, very fresh. And without any of that, Was Aranjuez a useless trip? No, right after my trip has become quite profitable. Count. And then, as you were with men? More and more varied, isn't it? More and more adventures, flirting... "one-night stands"... Casual sex, no? Less and less love, right? Count. The years you spent climbing in summer and winter. Count. Like a woman at that time told me: "We eat, we dance, we made love". And another: "We ski, we swim, we climb". Many words were not foreseen here. But they are forgiving you, thanks to the soft blow of the summer wind at this time. And beyond that, I have never climbed in my life. -Never? -Never. Truth... For a period, the child of love that I was in the beginning became in a woman of her time, or if you prefer, a current woman. And this period is lasting? No. Yes. I remember those years: only contradictions, from one day to the next, from one hour to the next, from one second to the other. Desire... Dislike of desire. Tenderness... False tenderness. Violence... Mild violence. Violent violence. And everything came so suddenly. Suddenly, the desire. Suddenly, the delight. Suddenly, the violence. The time, the period of suddenness. Stop me! And do you regret this period? I would love to regret it, but I can't. Even not believing in the sentence of the song: "No, I don't regret anything". In fact, I hate that phrase. It was a period in which I wanted, above all, take revenge on a man. You're gonna ask me, "Get even with what?" No, I won't ask. So, I ask myself. I wanted to con that man because of another man? No. There was no reason for me to revenge on a particular man. I have never been a victim of a man. Never. I wanted to con myself of men in general because I thought the entire species, the whole offensive sex? No. My spirit of revenge was not directed at a man, or to men. He was directed to a hostile, enemy spirit, that reigned and that it seems to me continue reigning in this world. Vengeance against conspiracy omnipresent and despotic of the everyday world against the body and the soul. And for this vengeance did you need a man? Of men? Yes, from a man's body. Of the bodies of men. Male. And what I realize, now counting, is that my revenges were never planned, premeditated, preconceived. It was each time, during the act... No! After the act... that I realized that what I had if passed and happened was simultaneously an act of vengeance. I felt it and I always stayed knowing a moment later and my accomplice knew how I did. What joy! What childish happiness! At the same time it was as if I was him, overcoming the obstacles of life, we would have made an affront to the prison world, as if we had done a prohibited move. Before, seriousness to two, like no other seriousness. Later, laughter as never before, in unison. A liberated, free, liberating laugh. The man and I had done an act of charity. We had protected someone, something. Instead of the time, we looked at the calendar. It was a date: "The Feast of the Bodies" A not very quiet party. The two of us we had shown something to the world. We take revenge of current events. "We take revenge of current events. We had both shown something to the world. Or: we had shown to current events. This liberation... What were the consequences? A new world? A durable new world? Made of which elements? The shadows of rainwater drops on the two naked bodies. A footprint of snow on the wooden floor. A lilac shrub in bloom on a dark night on the way back. A hedgehog diverts from us. We, in the headlights of passing cars honking enthusiastically. The blood trail, the only liquid on the pebbles of the dry bed of a river in the center of the world, north, south, west and east united. The wind blowing on the flat surface of the sea. The wind coming down from the mountain, one more time. The silver dust of mica landing slowly in the hot water of the lake in which we are lying. And, soon after, was no longer of any revenge. Each body moved beyond. It was more. It became everything. Far beyond all areas so-called erogenous. Besides what else? Only beyond. Neither he nor I. Only the universe of the body. Two lying bodies in the night of infinity. Time is transformed in body and soul and each A and each O are sighing for eternity. That's how it went. That's the way it is. Sigh... and take it. I counted almost 9 elements. Does that mean 9 accomplices? No numbers. Not here. Not today. Nowhere. Never! What was strange and it's still weird... Every time, after that act of vengeance, complicity with man has come to an end. Every time. I was proud of that complicity. And she was excited, wanting to talk about it. Hearts fired. The buzzing of the hides in the hangover. The cordial weight of tangled hair. With that act of vengeance we had contributed to save the world. But the man complicit was never taken into consideration. Without abandoning it, I immediately left of being the woman for him. Without saying goodbye to him, was goodbye forever. And the man... as before, with happy revenge, felt it silently like you and finally consented? No. Every time it became a drama. A tragedy. A drama. Fortunately, we both we are not in a drama. Fortunately... Maybe. There was something, an identical trait on all the complicit men? Yes. A dialogue with "yes" only goes against our agreement. Count. First, I noticed in each one of them something, or as you said, a dash that was missing, absent, that did not exist. None had that look that said: "I want you. I can have you. I can have them all. You too!" They had absolutely no that hunter's look. And now I remember... just now, speaking of that, I see what was present, what was in the eye of those men. Their eyes said... No! They didn't say anything. It was written in their eyes: "This woman is inaccessible for me". "This woman is... Oh, sadness! out of my reach". "She be mine? Unthinkable. Impossible". And it was that look of anguish, of an almost incurable anguish, that opened me to men. That was pity. No. A dialogue with "no" only goes against our agreement. That was compassion. Yes, maybe. No. That hopeless look It moved me every time. No. It disturbed me. Was it love? Don't talk to me about love. At that time I didn't believe in him anymore. Or rather, I didn't feel worthy of love. And especially to be loved. Not the word... Not even the word I was able to pronounce. And all those men they pronounced it night and day! The men? What is it? -Don't you believe me? -No. Yes, maybe. Yes. Yes... no... Yes, I believe in you. When I remember old movies, I believe in you. Even so, every time was love. A kind of love. One bedroom. A space. A space full of love. But not in me. Around. Know the song "Love Is All Arround? The feeling of life, the intensity, came from the fragility of the other sex, of continuous despair of the man inside me. Love... is to be loved by these fragile men. For them all. There was never a dislike afterwards? Never. Yes. There was once. Now I remember. Now, speaking of which... just this instant I'm seeing the image of my grief. So? The image... The contour of the man on the sheet after he left home. A monstrous outline? No. Nothing but the outline. And it was not simply a displeasure. It was contempt. Never see that man again. If you touch me one more time, die! No violence here today. That's fine. I'm even very grateful to those contours. The time of my lightness may have saved me. Saved from what? Of death. From dryness. From the drying up of my soul. Even doing that against nature, it gave me light from time to time. But since I needed love at that time! Don't tell me about love you too. This was not foreseen, nor was it agreed. Just a little melancholy in November, nothing more. Look... A thrush has just landed on the grass completely silent. Of all the birds this is what it looks like the most with the leaf of a tree sunbathing silently. Isn't it? Yes. I didn't feel kinder. Me, the woman. I didn't feel worthy of love. Me, as a woman. I needed this and I lived like... if almost all human beings were not kind at the time. And especially the women. Not loving. Worse... Hateful. Take a look! The man in the yellow shirt goes pedaling on the road there far. Alone, totally alone. You see? I hated my sex, the women, the so-called "beautiful sex Because their beauty, their beauty, was no longer true. It was an imitated beauty, with a façade. A commercial beauty, a beauty to be sold. Last night I dreamed with the pleiades, the 7-star constellation in the form of a diadem. And the pleiades were not shining there in the sky, but down here, very close to the earth, in front of a dark mountain, at the time of the sparrows' flight, above the plain. They shone like never before had shone in the sky. It was a beauty that demanded, which stipulated conditions, that plundered instead of gave. And only the beauty that gives is beauty. It was a closed beauty, instead of being an open beauty. A beauty that closes the other instead of opening it. And only an open beauty that opens is beauty. Isn't it? It was a time when the desire and the pleasure of my sex was to transform the man, the other, men, in pigs. Just to despise them then and revolt me for them have become pigs. There was no more sinister hatred at the time that women's hatred for men, by men. Nothing colder on the face of the earth. To forget what it was like to sleep together with the other. Ah, there is no deeper rest! There is no better banquet than to stay up there in the tree eating cherries. A long time ago that I don't see a woman. One that looks... to look behind her, to look around her... and let yourself be looked at. It seems to me that we women, like men, under this elegant surface, we are becoming completely wild with head and body, making us deeply shy, helpless, lost, full of sadness. Sadness, yes. Sadness. Once I sat a whole day in front from the open window. And throughout the day, the curtain was flying on my face. That meant: "Where is my love? Where is my other one? Why doesn't he come? Why doesn't he show up? Why can't he find me?" And that curtain didn't stop to fly in my face. Shooting like this my other in my direction. No! Apart from that! It hurts, today, to see the real face of a woman. Why the pain? Because she is doomed to be alone. To remain alone. Until today? Maybe since forever. It is terribly painful to be at the same time alive and alone. Remember that in our childhood there was a kind of connection between the summer and that wild plant called balsamina: "summer-balsamine The balsamine had a more common name: "Noli me Tangere" which means: "Don't Touch Me" Her name came from some fruits in the form of elongated capsules, and that during the summer they were getting more and more bulging. And when, despite their name, or maybe because of him, I would touch one of them, or as soon as it touched, they exploded making an almost inaudible dry noise. And yet, or maybe thanks to his fragility, in the summer silence of the forest, especially audible, almost like sound of a strange music. They explode and at the same time withered throwing the grains of the seeds in all directions of the airspace. These "Noli me Tangere" explosions and the launching of the seeds, with a capsule being touched after the other, meant to me not just summer, but the middle of it, its apex, the full summer of today. At that time I was the "woman of a constant sadness" The presence of a man from time to time, yes. But the presence of a man was never a solution. And yes, the body of a man, and especially his sex, was always a surprise. But not a good one. The balance and much more than simply a balance, the balance of bad surprise could only be achieved with love. I even felt it, sporadically, love for a child, or by an old human being, very old. Never love an adult. Neither man nor woman. What's hottest than the female form? What is sweeter? What is more fortifying? Just be careful if she wants to rule. The pride, clearly authoritarian with which a woman, then that she was with her beloved, looks around her, even if don't have anyone around, is a completely different thing. In this other authoritarian way only a woman can look like that: a woman you love. There is another sign from the apex of summer, of full summer like today: those little ditches, or dimples, those round holes in the sand of the squares, on train platforms, or in vacant lots. These tiny dimples form made in the sand by sparrows. Thousands of these birds, during the summer dry season, take a sand bath in them. Maybe not so much to clean yourself, but to get rid of the insects that are under their wings, in their plumage. Each sparrow, often several at once, is spinning here and there very fast, with the belly down, as if it had no paws, with the wings spread. They rotate like a propeller. And the next sparrow takes your bath in the same way. Frenetically and in ecstasy. Thus, the thousands of sparrows go leaving these holes deeper that gain the appearance of a model regular and especially rhythmic throughout the length of the sand. And one day before the rain comes, when the graves are deep, each new element of the model, at the same level below ground, these rhythmic graves, these are the symbolic images of full summer. Remember the last landings of sparrows that day. Each hole, funnel, crater, occupied by a small bird, and all of them spinning more frenetically, more ecstatic than ever. Remember how the whole extension became almost invisible on the clouds, with those sand minitornados that day. And how, one hour after departure of the population to the bushes, the rain threatened, one grain after another, dripping on the bottom of the craters, as if the ecstasy of bathers continued in the void, in the absence. That was the time I call of "the time without consequences" Or if you prefer, "the time of disconnected moments" And then what? The time without advice. Or if you prefer, the time of... "what can I do?" "I don't know what to do" "I don't know what else to do, what can i do?" And this season is lasting. It's still going on. It became even more palpable, more violent in the summer. Where is it hidden... my loving side? My loving self? My child? My self? Show me the place where you are hiding. For me, woman, today, each unknown, without exception, at first sight is a possible enemy. And after a long time, no longer a possible silhouette. Where is the woman that no longer declares itself only "a man's wife" but who also lives as woman of a man, as in the old days, in the westerns. Maybe it was just a fiction, but a fiction, by its own nature, is not just a fiction. Fiction? Imagination. These imaginary women of the pharoest and the medieval epics were not at all, are not in a manner submissive to men. Or worse, slaves. There is no desire more noble than the one these women imagined. Long live the other empire! The monarchy of a man's wife. Non-hereditary monarchy, not constitutional. Ephemeral monarchy, without power, without representation. Simply imagined, but imagined from a matter: the matter of desire. Heaven and earth will disappear, but my desire will never disappear. To be, to embody a queen like that, I would, I would sacrifice everything for everything. Window washer queen. Queen shoehorn. Queen... haircut and beard. Queen falling apart. Queen warming up. Queen treating the horse. Queen pulling fleas out of dogs. Queen... opening them-arms. Queen stealing fruits. Queen peeling potatoes. Queen gluing to a cup. Queen reading aloud. -Sheath... -Aranjuez! ...of a counter-history. For a long time now Aranjuez has no king... Neither queen. But that day, walking around the city I came across it, especially outside the city, signs and insignia of a kingdom of other times. And they were insignias and living signs, were not inanimate, lively and exciting. A beautiful day of full summer like today. And finally, the castle, the park, the center, the periphery of Aranjuez behind me, far away. Finally, the last houses, huts, shacks, gas stations, kennels. Through the savannah, grass alternating with the stones of La Mancha and forest granite, oak, chestnut and poplar trees, as in real parks, and at the same time nothing. The trees called of intertwined savages, one against the other as if they were fighting to survive. And the whole forest almost untouched, almost a virgin forest. Before my arrival in Aranjuez, had commented with me about the gardens around the royal residence. The King's Gardens. Formerly beautiful and crowded of fruit vegetables of all kinds and today they are missing. These vegetables and fruits from the past I found again in the wild forest on the way back from the savannah. Once I got used to it with the darkness between the trees, I saw it still sprouting in my feet, thanks to the light that entered horizontally, a shimmering ruby color, omnipresent, constant, sometimes just standing there, others, at the time of that the wind was beginning to blow, swinging, as if they oscillated. Guess what it was. Today is not a day for guessing. They were gooseberries. That were planted as a living fence bypassing the real garden. And that, with the abandonment of the garden, had immigrated to the wild forest of the steppe. They left the city, passed over the Tagus River and went up to Meseta. They were transformed during the journey through space and time during their journeys centuries after centuries. They have become remarkably smaller and the number of fruits in the branches is well smaller than the cultivated currant. On the other hand, the ruby color remained a thousand times more intense, as if the brightness of each of these fruit pearls was generated by own wild gooseberry, that gained a wilder look that strawberries, raspberries and the blackberries around. A very intense ruby color not only because of the decrease of size during immigration, but also thanks to the concentration of the content of all those little refugees. I tasted one of these wild gooseberries. One only. An acid explosion and at the same time of sweetness in my mouth that simultaneously spread throughout my entire body leaving in me a taste much more durable than any other real fruit. A taste that I still feel and who will remain with me until the end. And back to Aranjuez, I found in the savannah other fugitives of the king's garden, one after the other. One after the other. Green, white and black beans, peas, tomatoes, cucumbers, growing there in the high bush of the savannah. And mainly pumpkins round yellow, sometimes with red stripes and black, of all sizes, as in no other vegetable garden. And these fruits of the earth who immigrated of civilization and culture for the steppe grew up like wild children. And all, without exception, in circles. In circles that the ancient botanists they called "sorcerer's circles" Circles that intercepted each other and intertwined. A circle of pumpkins intercepted by a circle of cabbages. A circle of black eggplants interlaced to one of peppers very sharp of an almost shrieking red. Walking that summer day, I was following those hundreds and hundreds of sorceress circles. What a way to walk! There are good sorceresses too. Or existed. And the sparrows always flew away from the circles. Each time a whole gang. We should walk much more like this for the Earth. One action! No action was agreed upon. Only dialogues! A small action is allowed and even necessary. We must separate ourselves the noise of leaves from trees to wind of summer now! Today and another day. And soon, forever! Getting rid of this buzz that catches us by hair and takes us away leaving us in the same place, like no other noise. Actuality! The news! Leave us alone! Flowers! Flowers for the dead! Flowers for the dead! Flowers! Flowers for the dead! The beautiful days in Aranjuez have come to an end. We stay here in vain. Who knows what is asleep in the depths of time? There is no such thing as happy love. Nothing... besides the hungry wolf. And now, for a fraction of a second, the shadow of a giant bird. Or was it a plane? As if the sun had blinked. In some moments, the incessant cry of anguish of a child. A moan like the crying before death. A cry of death. In some moments, the long meow of two cats. Each being seeks his other. And up there, the wild geese of autumn are already flying south. One has already lost the love of the other from the beginning. And forever. Even if the other has not lost. One has already lost the love of the other from the beginning. And forever. Even if the other has not lost. No! In the middle age, the word which meant "love". female era: "la amors There is no such thing as happy love. "There is no happy love". "The Earth is naked and the soul howls for the pale horizon like a hungry wolf". "La loba famélica" Nothing but the hungry wolf. You and your endless summer tales. Fernando! Look here... the other eternity. A silhouette? One more. "Here ends the beautiful days of Aranjuez. We stay here in vain". I am not satiated. Who knows what is asleep in the depths of time? I'm hungry, Soledad. I am thirsty. It's very strange to get naked... even alone... Subtitles by Pedro Chamberlain
