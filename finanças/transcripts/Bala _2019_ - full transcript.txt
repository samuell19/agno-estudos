I am sitting on top of everyone's head. Big or small, I'm the centre of attraction in every mirror I am a treat for the eyes. And add likes to your selfies. I am the hero's style and the heroine's oomph factor. The secret of your beauty... ...and the permanent crown on your head. I am treated no less than God. Because we both get oil in offerings I am 'Hair'! The most important factor... The skin on your head... The protector of your brain... If you have me, I am a treasure to cherish... ...without I am just a lifelong regret. I'm an important contribution to everyone's life. This is the story of one such character. "Bala." "Bala." "Bala." Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sit. Mannerless Hey Baldy Meet Balmukund Shukla. Kanpur's Shahrukh Khan (Star)! Bala was simply in love with his thick hair. Ajju...just blow dry it. Bala, DDLJ style is old news. K3G style is the new trend now. In big cities small things keep happening senorita 'The little missy's in school were crazy about this Shahrukh ripoff.' 'Except for his friend Latika.' Due to my ugly looks, I was named Kubja. The world mocked me. No one ever came close to me. But it isn't my fault... that the Lord made me ugly. Let me alleviate your pain forever... Come Kubja, let me make you beautiful in every aspect. Hey... Latika. Give me your science book. I won't. Don't be such a spoilsport. Please give no. As I said, no means no. Return my notes. Hi! I said return my notes... Hey... ...save these hollow threats for someone else. Otherwise, when I am done with you... ...you'll regret being born. Hey... Move. Wait. Listen, please... - What's this? - Bala... What is it now? Latika. Next time you want to impress someone with the notes... ...then focus more on making your own notes rather than mimicry. Understand. Shruti, please. Shruti. Shruti. What do you think of yourself? I mean...what's the attitude all about? Whether I talk to another girl or lend her my notes. Why does it bother you? Are you out of your mind? I am not interested in idiots like you. And you have no right to be. With this black face. All the beautiful girls in school are crazy about me. And people like you should be banned from even thinking about me. Dark Kubja. Not another word from you... ...or else I'll slap you so hard... you'll bounce all the way to the company garden. I'll say it a hundred times. You can do whatever you like. Dark Kubja. Dark Kubja. Notice the lad's attitude. It's all because of me But even the ten headed Ravan's pride was shattered. And this is just one headed Bala we're speaking of. "Baldy." "Baldy." So, at the tender age of 25... ...Bala had lost 45% of his hair. I am a rascal... Doesn't take me long to turn a star into extra. "Your brother's abuses..." "...and your standing ovations..." "And every time I went flat broke in your love.." "I will never forget..." "As long as I'm alive... "As long as I'm alive..." "As long as I'm alive..." "Dumping me like yesterday's newspaper." "And ignoring me whenever I am around." "I will never forget..." "I will never forget..." Very good. Very good. When I make an exit from your life, I don't exit alone. I take your happiness, your smile, and even your 13-year-old steady girlfriend. - You are so sweet. - Dumps you without a notice. I had already warned you... ...that she is not trustworthy. Let's drop this topic. I've said so many times, I've diabetes, go easy on the butter. It won't hurt, son. Eat it. Aim at your mother. Vihaan, do you want a beating. - You two have breakfast as well. - Fine... Harder. I guess they'll have breakfast at lunch break. Yes brother, you eat because of for your heartbreak, and we'll have at lunch break. Everyone in this house is a comedian. See, grandpa... ...he's growing brazen by the day. Don't get mad at him. I wish you had focused on off break instead of heartbreak... ...then you would be playing for Ranji like me... Go on... Go on... Compare his heartbreak with cricket. Some mango seeds. God bless you. What? Is there an LCD screen on my head that you are staring at it? It's nothing... I was just wondering. Wondering what? Why did Shruti break up with you? You want a beating. Perfect catch. Why are you digging his wounds? Bala, you should forget Shruti. Soon you will find an angel. Stop carrying this makeup everywhere. There's no future in selling beauty products, son. You are an artist, so follow your passion. Understand. You followed your passion, didn't you? But where did that get you? How many people in Kanpur have played for Ranji. I followed my passion and that got me somewhere. Don't I want my son to be successful as well. I am still trying. When I make a name for myself in comedy, I'll quit this job. "Baldy." "Baldy." "Baldy." "Baldy." "Set out like an emperor..." "Watch him go..." "He thinks no one's better than him..." "He's non stop." - "He's on the top." - Hold this bag. "He lives in a classical world where he's hip-hop." - "With his head held high..." - Where to? - "He walks with pride." - This is important, I'll be back soon. "Because he believes he's the star of Kanpur." Bala, how are you? "Rupan, the more cola you drink... ...sooner you'll explode. Don't forget." Don't cross your limits. Just one more time Rajesh Khanna, please. Nothing in this world comes for free, aunty. How many women are you sending from your neighborhood for attending the seminar? I love it. You know what... First, help me out with Insta... ...and then I'll do your job. You never skip an opportunity to blackmail me. Here you go. Show me. Little more... Just a little more... - She will be hardly recognizable. - Come on... I have a question... What is this seminar you conduct for all the girls? I have the perfect solution for girls who can't get married. What has Latika done to you? Why don't you invite her? I've never said no. - Then? - Bring her over. But don't tell her that I invited her. Yes, aunty. What was so urgent? Actually, I am coming down to your court... ...and we've to attend a seminar together. What seminar? Bala's invited us. And especially you. Look here, aunty, I am not coming to any stupid seminar. I know you're a lawyer, but I am the judge in this family. I am coming down there. And now I am hanging up. Hello... ...aunty? You must be wondering why I called you all down here in the middle of the day. So let me start with my presentation. These are some matrimonial ads from the leading newspapers. Meaning Marriage column. That one factor everyone's stressed on...is fairness. Education, caste, creed, etcetera all come later. Just one demand. Fair girl wanted. Fair girl wanted. Probably you missed these matrimonial due to some reason. But you must have heard these songs. Bhajan Samrat Anup Jalota said... "Says to Mother Yashoda, Nandlala..." "...why is Radha so fair, and me so dark?" Kumar Sanu said... "O fair one...don't steal my heart." "O fair one..." Udit Narayan... "Black glasses on the fair face." In short... Who is fair is beautiful. I am not saying this It's the ideology of society. A tradition that's being followed since the onset of time. And no matter what you do we cannot change this ideology. Don't be disheartened, my friends... You can't change this ideology, but you can change the colour of your skin. Presenting Pretty You... 5 weeks... Yes, in only 5 weeks it will make you fair... Pretty You... Filled with herbal chemicals... ...for that fairness inside you. Excuse me. Excuse me. I had a question. - Can I come over there? - No, you can ask from right there. - I'll come there. - You can ask from your seat... - Move. - Save your questions for the... Why do you have that cap on your head? We are in a closed room. Is it too sunny for you? My cap, my choice. Take it off. No one else seems to be bothered, except for you. - Take it off. - I won't. Don't be shy. Take it off. What's wrong Balmukund? Didn't your company make a product for this baldness... Filled with herbal chemicals... Please, continue. Leave. I said leave. So where was I? Let me introduce you to my products. Here's... This is our beauty bar. No, this is virgin coconut oil Apply it on your hair before you sleep. This is our beauty bar. You can buy it at a discount of 15% Let's make it 20. In fact, buy one get one free. Total waste. Mr. Shukla. Why are you hiding back there? Show your face. You're looking pretty dapper today. Why did you spoil the seminar yesterday? Things went a little awry. But I'll cover it up in the next seminar. You claimed to have a fire when you joined us. What happened to it now? Sorry, sir. It won't happen again. Until you don't... ...sit with Mr. Bharadwaj and take care of the inventory. - Mr. Bharadwaj... - Yes, sir... I am sending a partner for you. Now you won't feel lonely anymore. Thank you, sir. But sir, I'm in marketing. I need presentable boys for marketing. Young and energetic. But I am young... what else am I? Varun, come. Now that's young. We're the same age. Handover your rocket to him. Now he's going to fly it. - Varun. - Yes, sir. Understand all the areas properly... - ...and go in all guns blazing. - Yes, sir. What is this? What is this? - What is this? - Listen to me, sweetheart. There's nothing to hear. I'll slap you so hard you won't know what hit you. - Where's the blade? - Not the blade... Not the blade... - You'll hurt someone. - Bala, what's going on? Jaggi... Before I cut you down to size, get out. Customer is God, Bala. Jaggi... Enough of your crap. You were being such a smartass and said that putting oil for 15 days will stop my hair fall. I did... I did...but listen to me... I'm losing more hair now. Everyone in office calls me old man. Fooling your own friend. Aren't you ashamed? You're an embarrassment to our friendship... You're turning bald! What do you expect me to do? I am a barber. I cut hair, not grow them. But hair is your expertise, isn't it? That is why I am asking you... Don't be sad. There is one way. See. This is a Thekla. Toupe in English. Just stick it wherever you don't have hair. - I don't need this Thekla. - Why? Masturbation and sex are two different things. This is masturbation. I want the real deal. I want to grow...real hair. How is that possible, brother? This land is completely barren. Are you stupid? I know the problem, give me a solution. Your solution is right before you... ...and you're looking elsewhere. Brother Bachchan... Who's this scrawny guy? He's my sidekick. But I want to be yours. Give me a sure-shot solution. Well... let's look at the problem area first. Someone might see me... Unbelievable ... Wait. The things I've to do. What the bloody... You were called Bala because of your silky hair, weren't you? Yes, brother. But now look at it. Don't be disappointed. Look, son, you're not the first guy in the world who is bald. The world's full of it. In fact, even Rajnikant sir is bald. Even though he's like... I was a star in school... A star... I've lived like a star. I am not used to be an extra. I can't live like this. Now you tell me... How can a star live like an extra? You can't imagine my pain. I can't focus on my job... Selfies make me self-pity My childhood girlfriend dumped me... for an idiot. The guy looks like me, except for one difference... Silky wavy hair... ...which I don't have. I am not just losing hair, but also my identity. I must admit... I must admit, son... You've taken the pain of baldness to the next level. I am losing hair... Please save me, brother. It's a difficult task. But I'll do it. And thus began the struggle to make this impossible mission possible. Why are you standing on your head, son? This ensures better blood supply to the hair roots. The infallible solution to falling hair. Keep trying. "It shall rain again..." "...and you shall be blessed With lushness." Stop staring at the puppy dog. Here's an idea... Mix castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, jute seed oil... Who wants these? I don't know. Mother asked me to bring these. Your mother's losing hair too. It must be hereditary. Put it all in a bag. Aunty, there must be several songs on the moon. "My heart's like the moon." "The moon's out tonight..." "Shining like the full moon..." And "shine brightly over the horizon, O moon." Balmukund... You're forgetting your stuff... I don't want it. But what about the patch on your head. First, you should go take a look at yourself in the mirror. The day you do that... ...you will stop looking in the mirror. That reminds me... I met Shruti, from school. Your ex-girlfriend. She was telling me that she dumped you. Why did she dump you? Vihaan... - Apply this on your brother's head. - Oh, mom... Vihaan. Slow down, will you... I already have a bald patch. Don't worry. "These silky tresses." "These mesmerizing eyes..." "Gives me a reason to live." "These silky tresses." Here you go. I will not commit this blasphemy for the sake of your hair. Never in this lifetime. Eggs in my house, never. This is my house, not yours. Don't forget you're a live-in son-in-law. You moved in claiming you'll stay only for three months,... ...but you've been here for 30-years now. Stop it, papa. Vihaan...give your brother a hand. Careful while applying it. Don't let a single drop fall on the ground. "It shall rain on you again." "And you'll be blessed with lushness." "It shall rain on you again." "Bala..." I'm about to tell you the biggest sorrow of a young man. Baldness. I was bald. Girls would ignore me. "Then I found this amazing thermal cap." "This gives warmth to my hair roots." Bala, your tea's right here... Nerds. "It shall rain on you again." Wow... I owned this race and I always win 'Cause I am the oldest player of this race. Wow... She always said the revolution will come... Will they bring revolution? Alone in the race... I called my school teacher baldy... Teased him. I drew his picture on the board. And now I'm being punished for mocking a teacher. Whenever I look at myself in the mirror I can hear "Baldy" ringing my ears. You think too much. Stop thinking about your hair. This is exactly why you're losing hair. This... - "After Holi..." - Don't think, don't think about it at all "...will come Diwali." "It shall rain on you again." "Bala." I see you when I close my eyes. I want to see you when I open my eyes. My eyes... ...look for my love Call it love, madness, or Son Bala... I heard Rubbing onion on the head helps grow new hair. Vihaan...give your brother a hand. Oh, God. Did you wash your hands? Look...we found someone for you on the matrimony site. She's as fair as an angel, see I don't want to get married. Listen... I am talking from personal experience. You should walk down the aisle while you still can. Otherwise, you don't have a chance later. - There's a bigger patch on this side. - Get lost. How are you going to fill this football field with a couple of hair strands? I need a temporary fix... ...so I can meet with the girl. I'll give your hair a makeover... ...that no one's going to notice this patch. Just watch... I don't want a makeover, I want an entire lush up here. You underestimate me. What is this? Close your eyes... and witness the magic. "It will rain on you again." "Bala." Bala...why don't you have a word with her? I've heard you're into mimicry as well. Let's hear something then. Well, who would you prefer? Dev sir...or... ...Shahrukh Khan. Actually, I like Ranbir Kapoor more. I never tried before, but can give it a shot. Hello, this is Ranbir Kapoor. You're the best. Will you marry me? Mummy... What else do you expect when you try Ajju's amateur ideas? Listen... I have the perfect solution for you. Make a mixture of buffalo dung and bull's semen and put it on your head. You'll have long wavy hair. Here you go, mister. And this will be 1500 extra. Vihaan...give your brother a hand. All I ever do is give him a hand. I've other things to do. I can't do this anymore. Why not? Stop exploiting me, brother. I beg you. Even inmates at jail don't get tortured so much... ...as much as you guys torture me. Every morning after I get up... ...I'm stressed wondering what dirty thing will I have to touch today. Now I'll give you a beating too. I don't care. I am not scared of anyone. I didn't pluck out your hair. You turned bald on your own. Your head, your problem... ...then deal with it yourself. I don't want any part of it. I am leaving. Do what you want to yourself I am not going to help. Get lost. "It will rain on you again." "And you'll be blessed with lushness again." "It will rain on you again." Hair transplant. In a Hair transplant, we take hair from other parts of your body... ...and plant it one by one on the part where you don't have any hair. You want this, don't you? - Yes. - You want new hair, don't you? Yes... The area from where we collect the hair is called the donor area. What is it called? - Donor area. - Right. Correct... Mostly we collect hair from the back of your head, your beard, chest, arm... But you don't have enough hair in these regions. And whatever hair you have, are pretty weak. So? There are two more donor areas. One is armpit He means under the arms, brother. He's right. And the other one... Down there... - What? - Yes... It will be very painful. I know it will be painful... ...but the pubic hair is always a couple of years younger. Have you lost your mind? I won't put pubic hair on my head. Sit down. Try to understand. So what if its pubic hair, it's still your hair. Even shit we poop is also ours, but we don't eat it. Correct. It will be a little curly, but they will look nice. Yaa curly hair is the latest trend. This man's telling me to put pubic hair on my head. I am never going to do it. But... Under the belt in the first meeting? Bala... you must go to Lucknow for 2 months, as a replacement. Mr. Saxena from marketing is retiring. Send someone more presentable. Young and energetic. Taunting your boss Why won't you go? Mom has a transplant... ...it's her knee. And anyway, I still have a lot of inventory work pending. You're a pain in the neck. I am... A big pain in the neck. "I am young even at 60..." "...finally got engaged." "No one to worry about in my family..." "...Mom, uncle, or aunty." "Youth jumped out the window..." "...as old age knocked on the doors." "I want to set those doors and windows on fire..." I am ready. What for? That thing you said. What? Using pubic hair on my head. But won't it be painful for you? He'll endure the pain. The hair can be curly... I'll straighten them. Doctor, I am ready to do anything it takes... ...just give me new hair. I don't want to wear a wig. Don't make me emotional. I'll think of something. Here... fill this form. What was your name? Bal Mukund Shukla. Bal...seriously? Write it down. Where's the doctor? Where's the doctor? - What's the matter? - Call the doctor out here. - What's the matter? - I've been robbed. - I'll kill you. Let me go. - Calm down. Calm down. What's all the commotion? What happened? - What happened? - Look at this... Its bleeding, the wound's infected. - Do you understand? - See what he's done to me. Don't believe him, he's a fraud. Don't worry...there is one in a million chance of this happening. Allergies like this... Diabetes patients are at higher risk. You don't have diabetes, do you? Fill up the form. And you come with me. What is this? What is it? What... What...? You should play that on the front foot. It's coming full toss. Come on... Come on... - I am not out yet... - Give me the bat. - I am not out yet, papa... - Throw the ball. - Fine, fine... - Throw the ball. Come on. Throw one ball. Throw him a good one. - Out! - Out! - Out. - You're out. - The ball didn't connect with the bat. - I took a catch. You're out. But the bat... I'll hit you with this bat. I'll swing this bat at you... Take the bat. I'll break your balls. I'll show you. What are you doing? Are you crazy? You think you'll hit me. Why are you interfering? This is not the IPL. We're playing cricket and you're turning this into a wrestling match. Come here... Better explain your friend... I'll kill him. Tell him... Come inside. Have you lost your mind? Have you gone berserk? Yes, I've gone berserk. I've lost my mind. Get lost, this is personal. Don't get angry at him. This is not his fault. It's your fault. This is all your doing. If you don't defend the ball you will get out. Not the ball, I am talking about my hair. What about your hair What is this? This... This bald patch... This is your doing. You've bad genes. My genes are bad. Look at mom... she's got amazing hair. Look at grandpa, he's still got hair at this age. He had hair until 5 years ago. And look at me... You gave this bald hair, plus diabetes. My hands shiver while uploading pics on social media. I get demoted at the job... Flop in mimicry... My childhood girlfriend dumps me. Talking to a beautiful girl scares the shit out of me. Imagining that she will laugh at me. I get proposals from weird girls. And when I do get a decent proposal... ...she runs away screaming like she's seen a ghost. Even dog's make me envy. I wear a cap before wearing my underwear... ..because without it, I feel naked. At least you have a beard, whereas I don't even get that. My life's ruined because of you. You won't talk to me like that. I am your father. Understand. Even Hrithik has a father, and he's bald. But he took care of his son's hair. He's got such amazing hair... ...even his six fingers fall short to brush through them. Did you take care of your son? Forget about me... What did you achieve in your life, papa? Don't talk to me like that, I am a Ranji player, son. Go on... Go on... I am listening... You played only one match and got retired hurt for three runs! Ranji... You must be really happy today? "As the saying goes, keep trying till you succeed." "Says who." "Even after trying 210 methods..." "...in the last two years..." "Bala has finally given up." Uppeji, get a glass of water. Why are you shedding tears? What else do you expect when I've piled on so much weight? - What... - It's all my fault. I've turned into a big fat cow. I've put on 30 kilos, sister. Every woman gains weight post-delivery. That's natural. That doesn't give your husband licence to flirt around with other women. Take my advice and divorce him. No, sister... why will I divorce him? He's my true love. Your true love's out directing another love story... ...and you are justifying his perverse with your overweight. This is wrong. Isn't self respect important as well. And what is this? I am fat, I've piled on weight... Look at her... Look at aunty. She turned 54... ...but her confidence never wavered. We've to be like her, Kusum. Strong and confident. Now leave... Darling... Give that to me... Look...no need to divorce him. He dumped you for your weight... ...and I got dumped for my moustache. Take my advice and try dieting. I read in a magazine recently, about the new keto... - ...and its really effective. - Kusum, now go. - Diet?... - No. Please... And call me later. Come here. Why are you giving such stupid advice to my client? Looks bad. Okay, fine. Let's drop this topic. Now fix your mood. We're going to meet a guy... Aunty, stop giving so much importance to guys. Why? He's a working guy... Has a job in Australia. Because of your marriage at least I'll get to see kangaroos once. And you want me to marry another kangaroo for that. "Body like silver, and hair like gold." "You're the fortunate one..." It's really hot this time. You must be used to colder weather... among the kangaroos. "You're the fortunate one, among all." "The rest are paupers." "Body like silver, and hair like gold." - She is dark - What are you saying? - "You're the only fortunate one..." It's so hot... ...that everyone's getting a tan. Look at him... Even he's got tanned. Stop it! "Body like silver..." It was really nice meeting you. I'm waiting for you downstairs. Bala. There are free samples in the inventory. Give that to Varun. Okay, sir. We're sending Varun to Lucknow. Because you have a transplant coming up, don't you? Actually, it's my mom who's getting a transplant. You find enough time for mimicry... ...and save all the excuses for the job. Huh... Give the free samples to Varun. Yes, sir. Give the payment to Pari's mother as soon as the shoot's over. Otherwise, she won't stop calling. Pari who? It's our model of course. Pari Mishra. Is it Pari's ad shoot? Yes, Pari's ad-shoot.

Especially for you all the way from Delhi. For me? It's a gift. Why get a gift for me? Must be an occasion. First, open your gift. What the... It's your happy hair day. Your father's gifting you hair, son. I know... you want real hair. But in real life reality is just fiction. I admit... maybe not like Hritik... ...but this is hair after all. Go out for a few days. People will believe... They will think that you got yourself treated. Papa... Sorry! It's all right. "...I made a comeback in Bala's life." As an opportunity. To make him a star again. To get his imagination out of Tik-Tok... ...and to make it real. Why do you look sad? Did you have an argument with the boss over allowance? Allowance hardly matters. I don't want to go to Lucknow. I just managed to score with a girl. If I lose out on her now, I'll have to start all over again. True... Dude, scoring with a girl in Kanpur is mission impossible. Tell me about it. Look at me... My childhood girlfriend dumped me. And I've been trying since then. But still...think about it. I've already made up my mind, but who's going to bell the cat. Me... Your girlfriend's my girlfriend. I'll go to Lucknow. And you stay back in Kanpur. But the other day you were saying something about your mom's transplant... I'll manage. You'll go to Lucknow for me. I will. Don't lie to me. Yes...

"You make my heart skip a beat." "You must have read a lot of books." "But have you ever read a face" "I have sweetheart, I have." "So what's written on my face." "My body's beautiful." "Love's on a fervor." "I want to enchant you..." "...with my beauty." "Come take me in your arms." "No, no, no..." "Don't steal my heart..." "Don't steal my heart..." "Don't steal my heart..." "I am crazy about you." "I love you." "I am crazy about you." "I love you." "I fear of separating from you." "I love you." "I am crazy about you." "I love you." You? What are you doing here? Courier for you, ma'am. Stop joking, come up. You'll fall. Careful... Why didn't you come through the front door? Why the window? Doors are masculine, windows are feminine. And since I am a romantic man, I like only windows. True. But isn't this old school? No, this is a tradition. From Romeo to Murad, everyone's done it. So why won't I? Murad? "Gully Boy... My time will arrive." Oh, yeah...I've seen it. Do you know how I feel when I am with you? How? Like you're a movie... Every time we meet, you make me laugh... and make me feel nice. But I am also scared... that someday it might come to an end. I am not some film, Babyu. I am like a never-ending series. You'll grow tired, but I'll keep going on-and-on-and-on... Well... ...you can come inside if you like? Seriously? The room's masculine, but the bedsheets feminine. I never realized how two months just swooped by. Isn't it? I must return to Kanpur tomorrow. But I'll come every week to see you. Promise? Promise... - Dinner's served, dear. - Leave. Go on, go have dinner. Fine... Now leave. 'With his new hair and newfound confidence...' '...Bala came like a brand new Rolls Royce on the streets of Kanpur.' He was no longer joke of the town... ...but the talk of the town. Mummy Papa. Don't I look like a star? - Bala? - Bala, my son...you're back. Bless you. - Mom, look... - Hello, aunty. Hello, dear. God bless you. Papa... Hello, papa - Hello. Can you feel it? Yes, yes, I can feel it. He's a changed man now. Even I am thinking of moving to Lucknow after retirement. That won't do you any good. I am putting you back on Marketing. Start with the presentations and let your rocket soar. Tell me the secret as well, brother. For growing new hair, my wedding is next month. I don't tell this secret to anyone, but for you, I'll make an exception. Hold this. The naïve population of our country... ...when they believe our politicians. - Why wouldn't they believe Bala's miracle story. - Give me. Me too. Have you lost your mind? Everyone will get one. Look... Wow...so beautiful. Help me out with this first. With this Insta pic. Wow... That's her. what's going on? Look... take a look. - What is it? - His angel. The nylon hair suits you. Listen... What do you think of Bala? As***le Me too. But imagine... an as***le like him scores with such a gorgeous girl. And that too the Pretty you model. And look at you... You don't like anyone. Don't take advantage of this tender moment to emotionally blackmail me. I've seen this world more than you, dear. And all I know is that the body has its own needs... ...which needs to be satisfied. Yeah... My-my, aunty...body's needs, huh! Shameless... Honestly speaking I believe... I'll never see you getting married. I'll be dead long before you decide to marry. Aunty... you're like Thanos. People will come and go, but you'll be still here. Who on earth is Thanos? America's Superman. Drop that topic...enough about America. The kangaroo from Australia's been texting you why don't you reply. Stop snooping around my phone. I will... Body's needs Why are you going back? No, I... What are you doing? Pari.. You don't even kiss properly. I needed some fresh air. I drove all the way from Lucknow. You spoiled the mood. Now you only say something. Actually, Pari, I've been trying to tell you something important for a long time now. Yeah...tell me. What if someday you find out that I have a flaw? That Cheapo Vani's beau is the one with flaws. Look here. She sent me this selfie. How is he? "Baldy." He looks fine. You call this fine. Yeah... Our wedding selfie should be best. Our wedding... Yeah. What? Won't you marry me? I will...of course I will. Tell me... I mean if you're just looking for fun... Don't be ridiculous. I love you. Then? Why did your face turn pale when I said our wedding? You're so beautiful... ...I thought it'll take me a couple of years before you say yes. I thought that too. So... You see... I am old enough to get married. How much longer am I going to wait? Mom-dad will grow desperate... ...and then force me to marry some random guy. So why don't we get married before that? Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yea... - Yeah? - Yea... Babyu... I love you, Babyu. We'll get the best hair stylists in Lucknow to help us prep. And our hairstyle will be the best, Babyu. You see, at wedding functions hair styling is everything. "The wedding procession will arrive..." "...bringing your destruction." I want us to look like Virushka... Ranveer-Deepika. Our wedding pics should go viral, Babyu. We can compromise on the attire. But what's the centre of attraction? Hairstyling. And remember what mom always says... - Looks.. - Never, Compromise on looks. I'll get the Ballerina hairstyle... ...and you'll get the long pompadour... Long what? Long pompadour style... Look... It's like this... Like Captain America. It'll look amazing on you. You'll look handsome in it. "Bride's on her way..." "...your secret shall be revealed." "Careful, Bala." "Bala learned the hard way that liars never prosper... "...he didn't know what to say." "He was flabbergasted." "Here it comes." "Here it comes." Why do you look nervous? I've been trying to tell you something for a long time now. I know... Know what? That thing you want to tell me. I can see it. What can you see? Your hesitation. Chill dude, chill... I know... ...my family's in a slightly better position than you. So what... We aren't exactly millionaires. I'll adjust. You don't worry. Yes, fine, but... Is it my mom and dad...? Mom and dad have already said yes, Babyu. And if they change their mind, we'll run away and get married. Our daughter is the supermodel of Lucknow. We've received many esteemed proposals. But she likes Bala... Anyway... The girls at Kanpur must be heartbroken as well. That's Bala you know, he's the best. Most edible bachelor. You must have an air-conditioner at home. Our daughter can't sleep without it. If both the teams have come to an understanding... ...do we understand we've all come to terms. Have you told her? What's the meaning of this? I almost told her. What's the meaning of almost? Huh... Bala...think about it. Are you sure you want to marry her? Whether he marries her or anyone else... ...but he should tell her. Have you lost your mind, brother? Why tell her? This is my wedding we're talking about and not a joke. I must tell her... Of course, you must tell her. But after the wedding. But that's cheating. Don't try to be oversmart. Our society is a male-dominant society... ...and this tradition's been followed for many years. Meaning? Meaning...in our society, a guy's flaws are not considered as flaws. I used to get fits. But did I tell your sister-in-law? Look, there are dozens of things about men... ...which the women find out after the marriage. Yeah... And she doesn't exactly have an option after the marriage. How can I lie... Even Yudhisthir lied once. You're just an ordinary guy. I don't think this is right... Look...for no rhyme or reason... ...whatever I say is the law. It's the least you got to do if you want to marry her. One day before the wedding, I'll give you a diamond facial. You're going to shine. What are you typing? Confession. I don't have the guts to say the truth, so I'm texting her. To whom? I am confessing my mistake to your sister-in-law. Look, brother Bala, only three days left for the wedding. Think before confessing. Bala... what are you writing? Tell me. I wrote... "Babyu, I wanted to tell you this but couldn't muster the courage to do so". "I've no hair on my head. I am bald." "This hair is fake..." "I am sorry for confessing so late, but I didn't want to lose you." "If you've forgiven me, then call back otherwise I'll take a hint." Are you high? - Delete it. - I am sending it. Bala...for the sake of whatever hair's left, don't send it. - I'm going to send it right now. - You can't send it. Brother said... Don't you want to get married... It's sent. You ruined everything. I dyed my hair hot-pink for the wedding. See... Finally, you found a hottie like her... I mean sister-in-law. You can kiss the wedding goodbye now. Confession. Are you a Christian? Thank God you didn't get a tattoo... Otherwise getting it off would've been extra. Pacing around won't help. Even God couldn't have found a beautiful girl like her for you. Hello. Bala... Sorry, I couldn't reply. I am busy with the rituals. You mean you don't have a problem. I knew you will call me back. I knew my love was true. I knew you will accept me the way I am. Yeah...I like the way you are. Can you do one thing... Can you install an AC in the bedroom? I'll put a dozen ACs in the room. I love you, Babyu. I love you, Babyu. I love you. What did she say? Did she say yes? With this bald head... Yes, she did... She said yes accepting all kinds of bald... Brother Bala... On the occasion of Bala's wedding... ...here's a special number from Soni Band. "Tequilla." "Tequilla." "It's a day of joy..." "...feeling on the top." "We're gonna mix soda, water, lime and drink what." "Tequilla." "Son has taken the plunge, Tomorrow he'll become a father" "With your fathers money What will you drink now." "Tequilla." Hello. Hello. Can we meet now? "Get in the groove." "Take a shot." "Or I'll give you a tight slap." "Tequilla." Brother Bala... "Tequilla." Brother Bala... What did you send me? Take a look. Let's talk later. Take a look. Please... I don't get it... You won't listen, will you... "Say something... Who did you chose?" "Where do you think you're going leaving your friends alone." - Brother Bala, shall I delete it? - "This happiness..." "...doesn't last for too long." "You're smiling today, but soon you'll be in tears." "Time will tell..." "...what will be the result." "Whether your marriage is hit or flop." "Tequilla." "Tequilla." "Tequilla." - Thank you - You're welcome By the way, you're looking beautiful. Thank you. Actually Thanks for coming. I thought you wouldn't come. Sorry for all those messages. But first of all, I want to apologize for what happened the other day. Mom was wrong. She shouldn't have said that. But it's a misunderstanding. Rohan, my ears are extra-sensitive to the word dark. I can hear it from a distance of 50 ft.. But mom's not like that at all. She was under a different impression about you. First she... She saw the wedding pics, then the Insta pics... I don't know what you're trying to say. I am not on Instagram... Your profile... If I was in your place even I would've reacted in the same way. The other day I thought these things don't matter to you. But after seeing your insta pics... ...we were a little confused. Babyu... Let's make a Tiktok of our wedding night. Coming. What are you doing? Come on, Babyu. What's taking you so long? Coming... I am sleeping. What are you doing? Babyu... Come na My heart...beats for you. Babyu... I was about to tell you. You really thought I wouldn't know if you don't tell me. I already knew. You look hotter this way. Come here, Babyu. Latika....come in. You left without having dinner last night. Where is Bala? - Do you need anything? - Please call him, aunty. It was his wedding night yesterday. Who wakes up early the following morning? Bala! - Bala! Bala! - Why are you screaming? You? Come down. Come down. Why are you fuming? Latika... - Don't go up there. - What's happening? - What's going on? - Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? - Will you tell me what happened? - What is this? - What is this? - What is it? - Stop making a scene, let's go downstairs. - I am making a scene. What is she talking about? Stop misbehaving with me. Why did you do it? You're looking nice. What's wrong in it? Who are you to decide whether I am looking nice or not? Who are you? I am no one... But your aunt forced me to do this. Why would I do it? Ohh... Because Bala's a little kid, he'll do as aunty tells him to do. No... But whatever I did was for your own good, Latika. Let me decide what's good and what's not for me. You have a problem with your baldness... ...then you can hide your bald patch with this fake hair. I don't have a problem with my complexion, Bala. I don't need this fake whiteness... If you try to interfere in my life again... ...then I'll beat the remaining hair out too. - Latika... - Stupid moron... How dare she talk to Bala like this? Talk to her Indira What is the meaning of this... What did you do? What did you do? What did she say? What was she saying? Nothing... She... She's my childhood friend. We often squabble like this. What was she saying? Show me. Listen to me... Let me explain, Babyu... Show me! Listen to me. You are bald. My husband is bald. My husband is bald. My husband is bald! My husband... My husband is bald! My husband is bald! My husband is bald! My husband is bald! My husband is bald! Why are you over acting? It's worse than Vani's husband. Calm down and listen... Let's talk... I don't want to talk. - Babyu... - My husband is bald! Babyu, why did you close the door? Babyu, why did you close the door? Open the door. I love you. You asked for an AC, and I got it for you. Babyu, open the door. I texted you and said that I am bald. But it got sent to someone else. How is it my fault? Tell me... I had lost my mind. Babyu, don't do something stupid behind closed doors. Babyu, please...don't commit suicide. Please...I apologize. I am sorry. Babyu, I am sorry. Please open the door. Babyu... Where are you taking the bag? Keep it... Leave... No no Let go. This is a new bag. You'll ruin it. Let it be. Don't do it. Don't go, please don't go. Pari. How can you leave for such a small thing? Pari! Let go. I said let go. Pari... Go on. Babyu... Babyu... Pari. Pari. 'When your bride leaves, you lose your reputation.' Son... Bless you. What's wrong? - You guys fought on the first day? - Where is Pari? She's upstairs in her room. She didn't tell us a thing. - Okay... - She isn't talking to us. Why don't you tell us if something's wrong? We'll explain to her. Why don't you explain to him? I am sure he's responsible. There's nothing to explain Pari. Explain what? Ask him. Are you having an affair on the side? Stop testing me... I am already quite stressed. Let me go. But son... Take the helmet off first. How can you leave home like this, Babyu? Sorry... I tried to tell you about it... It was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't tell you. Have you ever imagined why... I didn't want to lose you. I was very insecure about you. I even sent you a text but it got sent to someone else. It's not my fault. Whatever. Leave it. How can I just leave it? Be a good Babyu and let's go home. - I don't want to be with you. - Why not? What have I done? Loot or plundered? Am I a terrorist? I just have less hair... Less... Less... You have no hair... Its all about style... Even Rajnikant is bald. Don't force the issue. I'll wear a wig. I look so much better... - No one will know... - But I know, what about that? You're making a fuss over a little thing. Maybe for you, but not for me Looks matter for me. Why don't you get it? I never scored more than 45% in my studies. But all the guys used to hover around me. Why? Because I was good looking. I got attention all my life. Why? Because I am good looking. I got some modelling assignments, fame, my hoardings were all over... Why? Because I am good looking. I get 500 comments for every post... ...and 499 out of them say looking good. That's all that matters in my life. Looking good. So when the only thing I ever wanted was a good looking hubby... ...then was I wrong? It might be a stupid criteria for you, but that's all there is for me. Looking good. So what should I do? Go away. I'll wait for you. If you get bitten by a dog, you got to take 14 injections. But if your own dog bites you... ...then you need 28. Bala was bitten by his own mentality. 'I feel you're like a film...' 'Whenever we meet, you make me laugh...' '...and feel very good.' 'But I am scared that someday this film will come to an end.' I feel really lucky, Manju. Even I was bald. But you never walked out on me. She is my daughter. And she's not a deserter. Now, do you know why I stayed back for 30 years? Goodnight. Bala, you didn't invite us to the wedding... ...but at least invite us over for home cooked dinner by bhabhi She's gone home to Lucknow. Some rituals are still pending on their side. I'll invite you over once she's back. "Love is what it was." "And still is." "And shall always remain." "You were mine..." "And still are." "And shall always be mine." "Whether you know or you don't..." "Whether you don't believe me." "Whether you know or you don't..." "Whether you don't believe me." "But someday you'll say this too." Let it rip, dude. - Coming... Here it comes. Here it comes... - "Your love will stay..." - More feelings... - "...in my heart as pain" Emotion... Emotion... "My pain shall stay with you forever as love" Once Jaya ma'am gets upset with Bachchan sir and leaves. Bachchan sir says in his own style... Let's go, Let's go... Let's go to Manali...Kulu.. That's the place to be, instead of home. And it was exactly the opposite with Shahrukh... He got upset with sister-in-law Gauri and walked out, saying... No, no, no, I don't feel pain. I'll never come back here again. But I will whenever I miss Pari... I'll never come back. But I will whenever I miss Pari... Whenever I will find myself alone... Thank you. "The hurt I got... still hurts." "It will always hurt." "You're mine..." "And still are." Bala... Are you thinking of jumping? I was waiting for you to come by... You've brought me this far, now you just need to push. Stop bickering like a teenager? What are you doing here? I am feeling guilty for the other day... ...and I came to say sorry. You came to say sorry... Really? Please apologize, ma'am. Please...say it. Sorry. Apology not accepted! Get lost! A daughter in law is like an open weapon. She shouldn't stay out of the house for so long. It's been really long since she left. When is she coming back? What are you doing, son? What is that form? It's for hair transplant. I've decided to go for a hair transplant. But you have diabetes. I know...I know all the risks. But I have decided to go under the knife. If you've decided to put your head under the knife, then where will you grow hair. - On your hand. - I don't need your advice. All I am trying to say is you don't have to get into these stupid hassles. That toupe on your head is a much better solution. You're being a wise guy because you still have hair on your head. I know all this seems like a joke to you... ...but remember, I was your age when I started to lose hair. I knew it. I knew it, brother. - Knew what? - That you're jealous of me. I...am jealous of you? You're jealous of me, my hair. Jealousy is not good for health, brother. Don't forget. And stop staring at my hair with your greedy eyes. It's because of you I lost four strands of hair yesterday. I've kept them safe. Take a look for yourself. And if I lose one more strand of hair, then you've had it. I'll show you... What's wrong with you? I swear if you... Come here, son. There is no escape from me. I can't even eat my food peacefully. - I'll tell you. Break each other's head. Let him go. He's your brother. Finish this once for all. Idiots Stop! Take a look at this. What is it? What is it? What... What is it? Is someone going to tell me? She's charged you with fraud. She claims that you cheated her into this marriage... ...so this marriage should be deemed null and void. Null and void. Plus she's also claimed a million in damages. You wanted to apologize, didn't you? Now defend my case. You think you're some big-shot lawyer, don't you? I don't think I am... I know I am. Then defend my case... Do it. I don't want to defend your case You're a big pain in the neck. I don't have an option. Because I cannot trust another lawyer. Why? Because my baldness ... Because she left me for my baldness. If I tell some other lawyer, and the news will get leaked all over the city. I'll be humiliated. I can endure everything, but I can't tolerate anyone laughing on me. Please take my case... Please... Look Balmukund, you have cheated her. Why didn't you tell her that you're bald? I did... In fact, I even texted her. But it got sent to someone else. Went to Babu Presswala Sheer case of misunderstanding. You sent the text to Babu... Life's already screwed me, and you think its funny. Look, on a very serious note... ...you could've told her about your situation at any point in time... I would... I would've have told her this fact in my way if you hadn't messed up everything. And I would've kept her happy forever. Please take my case. Often I wonder how joyful life would be.. ... if could spend it relaxing my head on your lap She sent me a notice. Smile my friend. Smile... When you laugh your sorrows away, then joys will be worth the wait. Destiny will be your slave, and you'll be the king of your destiny. No... No isn't just a word, but a complete sentence. And starting today, you won't meet Pari, or think about her. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... "What a pretty way to reward my love..." Your love... "My own love robbed me of my happiness." Sonu Nigam. Sonu Nigam. - Good singer. - "My love's..." Brother Bala. What? Your picture's on the paper. My picture? Yes... There's one here too. This one...and this one... Wife dumps husband for his bald patch... Files a cheating case... "News has come." "You won't be able to save your honour." Now Bala had two hands... And the population of Kanpur was 4 million. Poor guy couldn't stop his life from going spiral... ...and his news going viral. He got dumped by his wife and you think its funny. You think it's funny, huh... I won't cut your hair. All the scams in the world and they think this is funny. You used to hang out with him, didn't you? Read it. She has also filed a case in order to get the marriage declared null and void. Now how did this news get to the newspapers... ...is what I don't know either. What is the poor guy going to do now? Bala. Bala, come out. Come out. Come out. What is it? Where is our beloved leader? He's not at home. He's gone out. He must be visiting the guy... ...who grew hair on his head with bull's semen. Come down if you have the guts. "Dumped by his wife." "He turned out to be bald." "He turned out to be a liar." "All his claims were false..." "...he had no hair on his head." "Show your face, Bala..." "...so we can turn your face black." - Let me do it, brother Bala. - I can do it. I can do it. - Let me do it... - I said I'll do it. Get lost. Eat. Aunty taught me a lesson when I was a kid... Listen carefully... Why did you do it in the first place? Why pine? When you plant a tree of cactus, how can you expect mangoes? The saying goes rubbing salt on wounds... ...but you rub every condiment you can. I am going. The hearing is coming closer, Bala. To hell with the case. I don't want to embarrass myself in the court again. Why? Because I have rotten luck. So you don't want to defend this case? No... Fine. I don't care. If you don't defend yourself, then it will be proof that you cheated Pari. But who's going to marry you after that? Have you ever thought of that? But anyway... The entire state depends on God... ...I am sure you can too. I am already so depressed and you're having fun as well. Why do you always get so melodramatic? What's the big deal if people found out? You... You will never understand I won't understand... You've been going through this phase for only a couple of years... ...but I've faced this my entire life. The complex about my looks... Comments on my skin tone... Embarrassment...suffocation... I've been through it all. And you were among them too. When a 10-year-old girl is called dark... ...you won't understand the mental trauma she goes through. And you say I won't understand... Stupid. Sorry. I will defend this case. These stupid things are not allowed in my office. Sorry, ...forgive me, O warrior queen. But this is my job. I know... You have a respectable job of demoralizing girls with dark skin tone. Where do you bring this over-activism from? Enough... I am going to write your statement today... ...so I'm entitled to ask you a few personal questions. And answer me correctly without feeling embarrassed. I never lie. I know how truth-loving you really are. Question no. 1 What happened between the two of you? Well...love...proposal... then marriage. Anything else... Anything else? Anything else... What? I am asking did you ever have sex with her? We didn't have sex... I mean we had a little... Well... How do I explain in detail? But why are you interested in my love life? Why would I be interested in your love life... Don't try to be over-smart. I am asking because her family can make a claim... ...that you married her only for a physical relationship. Pari can never do such a thing. Why? She loves me, and she will come back to me. How? Let me show you. She liked my video. See... "Your name's etched on my heart." "Your name's etched on my heart." "Filled with your love and care." "Your name's etched on my heart." What on earth is this? What on earth is this? My true feeling. "Your name's etched on my heart." The papers are here, sign them. Look dear, think before signing these papers. Is this necessary? Leaving your husband over such a trivial thing. Trivial... He has cheated us. I am talking to her. Pari... Look at me. - Put that down. - Return my phone. This thing's ruined your life. I've already said that I don't want to live with him. And I don't want any money either. Now return my phone. So...did you spend on anything else at the wedding? Isn't this enough? Why would it matter to me? He's your son. You can spend as much as you like... No, we didn't spend on anything else. Except for little things like booze... Where is Bala? Why? What do you want from him now? I am his Lawyer. I've got to do my job. She isn't complaining either. He's upstairs. Go on. Your room's nicely decorated. You've still kept all the photos. Aunty says there's one moment in our life that's very close to us... ...and we want to live it over and over again. This is...that part of your life, isn't it? Yes. Are you coming to the school reunion? No... Why? I feel bored. Bored... Bored or embarrassed. Why would I be embarrassed? You were the star of our school. And now your image's shattered. Enough of this nonsense... Let's discuss the case. If you don't come, then I won't defend your case. Why? Come on, you'll have fun. And don't worry... No one cares about your personal problems. Tell me one thing... who looks the same throughout his life... Why don't you accept yourself? You look good the way you are. I am going to take a case of this KESA It's been more than four hours and still no sign of electricity. I am going to file a PIL against them. Wait and watch. And unfortunately, I got the name Kubja. Everyone shunned me. Come Kubja, let me make you beautiful. Why did Krishna have to make Kubja beautiful? Someone could have liked her the way she was. Nonsense... When God has set the wrong precedent, why blame humans. I knew it... ...someday you will wage war on God. You will not understand. Come on. "As my heart..." "...struck a bell." "All those memories came back to me." "All those tales..." "...which I want to keep..." "...etched in my memory forever." "As you walk me..." "...down that same lane." "I want to stay for a while." "I am waiting, o Life." "Hold my hand and guide me." - Hi, Rishab. - Great... Sir, recognize me. Bala. Bala. How are you, son? Doing great, sir. Actually, I wanted to apologize to you. Remember, someone drew a sketch of you on this blackboard and called you baldy... ...and humiliated you. That was me, sir. I knew it was you. See... I made this myself for you guys. Sir. Come on, let's take a picture. Everyone sit in your place. "I was a little disillusioned." "And also a little cheeky." "Every mischief followed by another." "All those whom I troubled." "Were right before me." "Those friends were my real treasures." "I want to face them..." "...and take a good eyeful." "The moments that I lived back then." "Even if you trouble me..." "I forgive you, O life." "Here I go again, O life..." "... To be happy again." According to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Marriage is a sacrament. Marriage is a holy bond. It's a belief. How can a marriage based on the foundation of a lie... ...be considered as a marriage in any aspect. It's just fraud. Is it fair to annul a marriage on the grounds of baldness? Let Pari Mishra decide whether it's fair or not. She feels cheated. Okay then... I want to ask Pari Mishra some questions. Go ahead. Did you marry Balmukund only for his hair? No. Then why did you marry him? He is charming... Was... He was a good comic. He had a good sense of humor. You wanted to pursue a career in modelling. Right? Yes. What was Balmukund's stand? He said he'll support me in my career. Did he ever abuse, misbehave, or resort to any sort of violence, physical or verbal, with you? Never. You see, ma'am. Pari married Balmukund for his good heart and decent behavior and not his hair. Fine... agreed. Agreed... Agreed... Let's agree that he was a very nice person. But if he was such a nice person... ...then he could've told her about this mop on the head. Why didn't he? Balmukund, please take off the patch you're wearing on your head. Take it off. I said take it off. Please take it off so we can bring the real matter of this case in light. We never agreed on this. Just do as I say...take it off. Remove it, trust me.. remove it. Stop. Stop. It's okay. Did you notice his hesitation? The embarrassment, the humiliation... ...which every stout, scrawny, tall, short, bald, and dark-skinned person goes through every day. Because they are made to realize this every day. Balmukund hid this fact from Pari for this embarrassment. And not his intentions to cheat Pari. I think you've taken this matter rather personally. What do you mean? What do you mean by I've taken this personally? What is he trying to imply, ma'am? Is he trying to say that I took this case personally because I am dark-skinned? Is this what this man is saying? Please, I never said such a thing. That's exactly what you said and it is not acceptable. This is a sexist and a racist remark in the court of law. Calm down. This is an insult of a female lawyer and this will not be tolerated. Please tell this man to apologize. Mr. Raina, what is this... Okay, sorry...sorry, I apologize. It's not about you or me. Nor is this case about body shaming or embarrassment. This case is about a woman's rights. A woman will be seeing this face for the rest of her life... ...so doesn't she have the right to decide how he should look. If Balmukund hid the fact of his baldness and married Pari Mishra... ...then our Constitution... ...gives Pari Mishra the right to refuse to accept this marriage. Look at him. Balmukund Shukla. He has many qualities. Like Pari just told us. He is sensitive, he's emotional, he's caring, he's decent, he's a nice man. But if you can't see his goodness and qualities... ...and just a patch of hair, then you need a doctor and not a lawyer. Wow...what a statement. Order. Order. Madam... I won't tolerate gimmicky here. Your honour, I want to ask Pari Mishra's last remark. I saw a mirror in Bala's bathroom which was half-covered. So when he can't stand watching his own bald head... ...then how does he expect me to do the same for the rest of my life. Is it fair? - Ma'am... - It is not fair. Bala... It's not fair, Latika. Not fair at all. I should have told her. And not before the wedding... ...in fact, I should have told her when we fell in love. But I couldn't say it. I could never muster the courage. I did make a mistake. Forgive me. Pari, if you don't accept this marriage, then... ...I request you to annul it. Bala, why... I can't force her to love me. The court has heard the arguments from both the parties... ...and respects Pari Mishra's personal opinion and annuls this marriage. This marriage shall be considered null and void. We've won the case. Time to celebrate. - Congratulations, sir. - Pari... I want to apologize. All the best for your future. And this time, find someone with that long pompa... Long Pompadour Yes... ...find someone with that kind of hairstyle. And this time make sure by pulling his hair. Okay... Bye. What are we selling? Tell me... Rahul. Bala, you tell us. Fairness cream. No. We're selling water cooler in the desert. Heater on the Himalaya. Booze in Bihar. Fresh air in Delhi. We're selling beauty to this ugly country. For only 15 rupees. 15 rupees? Even lemonade is more expensive. And we're selling beauty at this rate. What else does one want? So my brave soldiers of beauty... Go now and make all the dark and wheatish tone females in this state realize their ugliness. Go... Get under their skin. "Give me more sale..." "Stick it. Stick it. " "Give me more sale..." "Stick it. Stick it. " "Give me more sale..." "Stick it. Stick it. " Go and stick it then. Fair. Fair. Fair. Meaning... who is fair is beautiful. Caste, education, doesn't matter. Except for one thing. Fair girls only. This is an ideology of society. You cannot change this ideology, but you can change the colour of your skin. Buy Pretty You! Bala... Get fairer skin in 5 weeks. Go on... You cannot change this ideology, but you can change the colour of your skin. But why change it? Why change it? Why change ourselves? Why not? Exactly, why change ourselves? Why change? Why change ourselves? We won't change. Sir why do we need to change? What did you do? You said stick it, stick it. So I stuck it, sir. Proud of you, brother Bala. Hold this. See you later. So finally Bala renounced me... ...like Gautam Buddha renounced the world. Bala... Let it be. Vihaan's been selected for Ranji Trophy. Ranji huh, bro... You'll play for the country someday. Let it roll. It's an auspicious date, you know... This is really good. We'll get these two married on that date. Who are you? Bala. What have you done? We're getting Latika and Rohan engaged. Good, you're here. This is Bala. He lives in the same neighborhood. Sit, son. Come come sit. You never told me that Rohan and you were having an affair. Your marriage was on the verge of breaking... ...so I didn't think it was right to tell you. It seemed awkward. But what are you doing here? You know what I am doing here. I've come to propose. Yes... I couldn't muster the courage because of my fake hair and the job But now I've quit. And finally got the confidence to propose to you. Please reconsider. Seriously, Bala. Get up. What is this? A film? Did you really think you would come down here and propose to me on my engagement... ...and I'll go with you. He loves me. Even I have started loving you. Bala, I am your rebound and not your love. Please understand. You never had feelings for me. Maybe I did... but now I have those feelings for Rohan. So there's no chance for a dramatic climax. Not even this much? Not even this much... S*** man. "Trouble me all you want." "But I forgive you." "Here I go again..." "To be happy again." This look suits you. Looking nice. Thank you. I mean it. For showing me the mirror. Because the mirror in my room is half covered. I could never see myself. But now I have. That's a good thing. Are you going to make us laugh today or not, Bala? Friends, I didn't come here to mimic Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, or Bachchan sir. I am someone else today. The one on this mic is Bala... Because you've seen Bala in this hair. So you'll ask if this is Bala, then who am I? So I am Bal (Hair). Doesn't it look like the Clean India Campaign started from here? Rupan...what's so funny? Look at him. If anything is under more pressure than Virat Kohli, then that's his shirt's button. I bumped into him in the market the other day. He was wearing his wife's slippers. I said, how did this happen? He said I can't see what I am wearing on the other side of my stomach... And that's Nandkishore aka Nandu. Kanpur's black panther. If you throw an ice cube at him, it will turn into cola. Many years ago Nandu went to Mumbai... ...and the place where he lived is known as Andheri now. And that's Jaggi... Raise your hands, we can hardly see you. He's so short, that he's never seen an adult film. The guys at the movies drive him away saying this film isn't for kids. Just like he's fat, he's dark, he's short... Similarly, Bala is bald. Bala lost his hair before he could lose his virginity. Bala is so bald that people sometimes mistake his bald patch for the full moon. Then I realized that your lost love can come back, even the government can come back... ...but hair once gone can never come back. Go ahead, laugh... It's necessary to laugh at this fat, scrawny, short people... ...because our tradition says so. So go ahead and laugh. Because I won't feel offended anymore. Because I am going to laugh with you. I won't try to change myself. Why change? Why change ourselves? Whether you accept me or not, but I've accepted the way I am. Back in school, I did a play where Lord Krishna turns ugly Kubja into someone beautiful But today I finally understood that story. Krishna didn't make Kubja beautiful... In fact, he only made her realize her beauty. And the day you realize that you'll be the most beautiful person in the world. Whether you're fat, scrawny, short, bald, or whatever you look like. If you love yourself, the world will love you. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Come fall in love... with yourself. "Trouble me all you want." "I forgive all your mistakes, O Life." "Take me in your arms, o Life." "Take me in your arms, o Life." "You just wanna." "Listen..." "I am a little crazy, do what I think." "Play a song that's funky." "Not the heart, nor the wealth." "This is about your body." "I go crazy when you're in front of me." "You're not tall, dark, or handsome, still you're in my heart." "Your heart's driving me out of control." "I like the way you are." "I just wanna..." "Feel your body." "Touch my body." "Don't be shy my honey." "Touch my body." "I wanna feel your body." "Touch my body." "Don't be shy my honey." "Touch my body." "Fly my honey..." "Don't be shy my honey." "Fly my honey..." "Don't be shy my honey." "Listen..." "I am a little crazy, do what I think." "Play a song that's funky." "Not the heart, nor the wealth."

"Don't be shy my honey." "I wanna feel your body." "Touch my body." "Don't be shy my honey." "Touch my body." "I wanna feel your body." "Touch my body." "Don't be shy my honey." "Touch my body." "Fly my honey..." "Don't be shy my honey." "Fly my honey..." "Don't be shy my honey." "As my heart..." "...struck a bell." "All those memories came back to me." "All those tales..." "...which I want to keep..." "...etched in my memory forever." "As you walk me..." "...down that same lane." "I want to stay for a while." "I am waiting, o Life." "Hold my hand and guide me." "I was a little disillusioned." "And also a little cheeky." "Every mischief followed by another." "All those whom I troubled." "Were right before me." "Those friends were my real treasures." "I want to face them..." "...and take a good eyeful." "The moments that I lived back then."
