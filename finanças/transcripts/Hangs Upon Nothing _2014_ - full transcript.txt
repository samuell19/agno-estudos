(buildup of ethereal sound) (slow buildup of music) [Voiceover] Yeah, it depends on... You have to be comfortable out there at sea. Where your boat is your house, or your... You have to, you have to work it so you have a sea life, and that you're, you're part of the um... There's two types of people. There's the ones who's, they're frightened of the dark and what's around each corner, and then there's the other ones who... Just like surfing, it's they're, they're, they're dealing with it as it, as it comes. (young women singing in Kiribati) - [Voiceover] Yeah, there you go. Yeah, so uh, which sailing school did you go to? [Voiceover] We're self teaching ourselves right now. [Voiceover] You did what? [Voiceover] We don't know bananas about sailing, we're learning as we go right now. [Voiceover] (laughing) Does Jeremy know this? [Voiceover] Yeah, he's finding that out now. In fact, he knew a few little things today, so. Yeah, I have lots of miles of going around the ocean, but I just don't have any miles where I'm sailing my own boat, so, so we're learning as we go. (women laughing) Over the years I've met people back to back and one person talks about their passage being a real horrible passage, and the next guy arrives and says it's just another walk in the park. So... (serene atmospheric music) (islanders singing in Kiribati) (serene, sparse electric guitar music) (tranquil music) I asked myself a soul-searching question. Why was I out there? And... And the reason why I was out there, was to surf and enjoy life and not to try to change things politically or culturally. And whenever you get involved with politics, wherever you live, that's a whole different arena. (old man singing in Kiribati) (dreamlike music) One writer a hundred years ago termed it as a transculturalite. One person who temporarily or permanently relocates into another culture and lives under their, lives and abides by their values of that, of that culture. [Voiceover] Have you gone troppo? [Voiceover] Yeah, I think I've... reached the point at times where I've been absolutely nutty out there. I think most everybody gets to that point and usually when they do, they get to the point where they say screw it, and they... They, they go back. I most certainly have been to that point where I absolutely hit, hit this wall where... (tranquil music with percussion buildup) (buildup of bombastic music) (guitar feedback) (serene music) (mid-tempo music) [Voiceover] I can tell you where my life began, when I was, when I was three years old we did a trip to Tahiti and I can remember all of that clear as yesterday. And when there's photos of me being three, and uh, yeah, ask me anything about it, I could tell you. [Voiceover] Well, what did, who'd you go with and what did you guys do? [Voiceover] It was a family trip, it was before Daniel was born. My mom and dad and my sister Malia, we had a VW thing, we did a boat ride to the end of the road and uh, caught fish, and we fed all these fish heads in a river to all these eels. I remember topless girls, I remember canoe rides, I remember walking out on a starless, no, on a moonless night and there's stars everywhere. I remember waking up in the morning and our seats in our car, 'cause there's no top on the car, it was soaking wet. What else do I remember... I remember everything. That's as far back as I can ever remember. [Voiceover] Did you surf at all on that trip? [Voiceover] Um, probably on my dad's board, with him, but not by myself, I was three. (laughing) [Voiceover] Did this trip have any like... [Voiceover] Significant... [Voiceover] Yeah, significant impact on your direction in life? [Voiceover] Yeah, I would say it did.

Just to see what the land looks like from out on the ocean is usually really peaceful for me. But also just surfing with my friends and my family, that's usually my favorite part, is just... Just being in the water with someone like, you know like people you care about. That's usually the most magical parts, parts of surfing for me.

Fuck, I was like, scary, oh my God, maybe I break my surfboard or leash maybe I get stuck on the reef over there. Maybe I get washed away, you know? I don't have any help there, so. When the wave break me, I throw my surfboard, and in my heart I just praying, praying, and say help, help me God. I say, I don't want to die now.

On my first wave, I was like, wow this is amazing. I was just going really fast, I was coming into the inside section, and this guy drops in on me and I swear he was like 15 feet away and within like one second, I just ran straight into his back and I hit him going so fast I got all the air knocked out of me and we were underwater and I just felt, I felt this like round, I don't know, I felt something kind of like, down by my stomach and I just squeezed it as hard as I could and I think it's the guy's head and he came up, 'cause I was really angry, like it hurt, like I ran into the back of him, he was a big guy. I just started squeezing his head underwater and when we came up he's like, oh sorry man! I was like hey bro, no problem, don't worry about it.
