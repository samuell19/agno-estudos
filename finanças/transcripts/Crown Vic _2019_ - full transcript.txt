Shit. Hey. Trunk ain't gonna close itself. Sorry, you know, first night, right? Plus this uniform doesn't.. Doesn't fit quite right. Ray Mandel. Nick Holland. Are you feeling okay? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, what do you mean? Desk Sergeant said you shot your lunch all over the head. Oh, don't worry, I'm sure they have video online by the end of tour. You might have bought yourself a new nickname. I do that when I get nervous. I just don't want to screw up, sir. Hey, don't sweat it. They dick around with all the new guys. Piece of advice though, anybody offers you anything to drink, throw it out. What about your flak, you wearin' it? Yeah, they told us in roll call. Like an all units or something. Hollenbeck, right? Bank in El Sereno, yeah, copy that. Two man show. They had AR15's, Benelli pumps, high capacity loaders, the whole fuckin' deal. They had police scanner's goin' the whole time. It was a total ambush play. Wow. Right? I guess that's the deal though, right? What's the deal? That, this. You know, you roll up on a 211, a bank, a liquor store, shit could go somewhere, shit could go nowhere. You make it home or you don't. You roll the dice and see what happens. Just roll the dice. Your 38 seconds on the job teach you that? My old man. Anyway, that drill that shit into your head your first day in the academy. What's that, Elysian Park? Civic Center. Yeah, 28 weeks. I got three years before this. Municipal detail, OPD. One thing you got to remember, man. You're out on patrol, there's the world inside this squad car, then there's everything else outside of it. You see? The only thing keeping you from what's out there is a couple thin pieces of metal and glass. You got to respect it. Your equipment too. I mean, always respect your equipment. Say it. You want me to say that out loud? I'm serious, man. Come on you do a rover check, check your batteries, check your vest, all your gear, your piece. What do they got you guys carrying? Sig 226, 16 round capacity, got these new V crown carbon points. Can I see it? Sure, yeah. What the fuck are you doing? Didn't anybody teach you firearm control? Put the fucking thing away. Jesus. And keep it clean, okay? You got to pull it, God forbid, you don't want a misfire because you wore it out at the range and never cleaned out the residue, which believe me, fucking happens. Say it. Always respect your equipment. Good newbie. You might make it out of the garage. This is America, motherfucker. Hey, what's happening? Let me out, bitch! Keep your eyes up tonight it's gonna be a barnburner. That's why they pay us the big bucks, right? Hey, sir. Nick Holland. What are you my fucking bartender? What? Then why would I give a shit what your fucking name is? Geez. Whole department's on alert and they got you breaking in this fucking transfer cherry? Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up. Fuck you! Hey, that thing you wanted me to look into, I got to talk to you later. All right? By the way, VanZandt's on the prowl tonight on your zone. My favorite guy. Hey, I'm just the messenger. Let me get dazed and confused up to booking and I'll check you later all right? Be safe. Nick Holland. Nick Sr., that's your dad? Sergeant outta Hollenbeck now, right? Used to be, yeah. They kicked him upstairs, he's out of Compstat now. Made Lieutenant. Hmm, big fucking shoes. You walk into a room, your name comes in two steps ahead of ya. Yeah, cops got opinions. They ain't shy about 'em. So that don't bother you, Nick? What you were saying, that roll the dice bullshit? If I answer wrong, sir, does it get checked off somewhere and end up in my training file or something? You're way overthinking this, kid. 10-37 intersection of 8th... I do know when I get nervous, I talk. And vomit. Any available unit please code two. Yeah roger that Olympic, 14 en route. I just wanna know. I don't know, I guess if it bothered me, I should be selling shoes or something, you know? Hey, give yourself 20 years, you might feel different. 10-37, that's a.. Suspicious vehicle. Right, I was thinking 10-97. Prison break? Yeah, I guess. Which would be odd. Didn't use these codes much in my last detail, that's all. Pretty soon you'll be hearin' 'em in your sleep. When you do sleep anyway. Jesus, hang on. Jesus, what the fuck was that? Somebody threw that shit at us? Hey! Kid! Fuck. 20-L-14. I am in pursuit, suspect is on foot. Corner of Crenshaw and Vermont. 14, do you need assistance? That's a negative. You doin' okay? You feelin' all right? You're not gonna puke again or anything, are ya? Go. All right, I'm gonna go get this guy. Hands! Show me your hands! You little piece of shit. You throw this at my fuckin' squad car? I didn't throw that shit, man, fuck you. What, you turn on a TV, you think it's take a free shot at a cop night, asshole? Turn around. Give me your hands. Where the fuck I'm gonna get a brick anyway? 20-L-14, 504 in custody. Look at that. You're two minutes out, you already caught your first caper. Shit. Way this shakes out is you get me for two DP's, okay? That's 28 days each. Then they kick ya to someone else. Look, anything you've never done before, I'll do it first, then you, okay? So, first traffic stop, first report, first field interview, just pay attention, watch what I do. Okay. And don't fuck up. You can fuck up once. Fuck up a second time, you go back to Oakland. Most of what we deal with out here is pretty fucking simple. You got drunk in public, complaints, quality of life shit but there's also a lot of things you can't predict, which means you stay alert. Always be thinking tactically, okay? 'Cause everything you do and every place you go is a potential situation. Olympic's what we call a heavy division. It ain't the 77th where pretty much everybody walkin' around's got a warrant but we still get our share. 20-L-14, please confirm on suspicious vehicle. We have multiple units in vicinity if necessary. Yeah, 14 en route. Keep your shirt on for Christ's sake. This is us here? Yup. Western Bureau. Basic patrol zone is everything from Pico to 5th. Koreatown all the way to Boyle Heights. So, you wanna build a routine, okay? You patrol at night, you find out who's got business being out late and who don't. Be nosy. Somebody looks guilty, you watch 'em. They look innocent, watch 'em closer. What do you think, that look suspicious to you? Just like Elysian Park, okay? You get out, you stay behind your door, if it's all clear, you come out. I got left, you got right. Yeah, I know the drill. Clear. Yeah, clear. Son of a bitch. What? That's an hour of paperwork right there. You got property loss, you got fuckin' fire, you got one for the hook, another for the insurance. 20-L-14, I'm gonna need fire unit and a wrecker on that... Hey, everything okay? Roger that, 14. Yeah, yeah. No honey, I know. I will, okay? All right, I love you too, bye. Are you ready? Yeah. You need some more time? No, no, I'm good. Why don't you go get the fire extinguisher and some flares? Okay, got ya. Here you go. Is she checkin' up on ya? Yeah, it's the first night, you know, she likes to worry. Yeah? Is that wife or girlfriend? Wife. Two years. That's optimistic of ya. Any kids? I got one on the way, she's due in two weeks. What do you mean, optimistic? You're the second cop whose told me that. Ah, it's a numbers thing kid. Math is fuckin' brutal. Oh, shit. What? Son of a bitch. There's somebody in there. They let you do that? What? These? Yeah. City property, right? Fuck that. A man's on patrol, he needs something. Coffee, smoke, whatever. Keeps him sharp. Keeps his blood pumping. Mark my words, next thing they tell ya, no coffee in your black and white. Can't trust a man with no vices. My old man used to say bad habits were the only thing keeping sane men from going off the deep end. You know? Like an oiler doesn't feed the beast he'd end up in a clock tower with an AR15 or something. Is that your first? My what? First DOA. First corpse on the job. Oh. Yeah. Bad way to break your cherry, Jesus. 20-L-14 are you with traffic homicide? 14 please advise. They go on like this all night? All night, every night. It's like living next to the airport, you know, after awhile you don't even notice it. Give her a 10-8, will ya? 10-8? Car number and the 10 code. Right. 20-L-14, 10-8 back in service. Roger that, 14. My first assignment, I was in a drunk wagon out of North Hollywood. It wasn't uncommon we'd make 15, 20 arrests a night. We'd see these traffic fatalities? Jesus. Think about it, right? You're just some guy. You got a life. You got a friends, a family, a job. A drunk, some doped up asshole comes swingin' across the median, blink of an eye, all gone, erased. Only thing that really mattered your whole life was the moment the front of that car opened up and swallowed you whole. So, what you're saying, life, everything we do, none of that shit means anything? Hey, life goes on, right? People think they die they leave behind some gaping hole in the universe or something. That's bullshit. Life keeps going, man. The world keeps spinnin' without you. That's a dark fuckin' way to look at the world, man. The world was dark when I got here. I just see it the way it is. So how long have you been an FTO? Like two hours. What? Really? I'm your first trainee? Hey, I rode patrol 25 years. First eight in North Hollywood, seven years Rampart, last 10 they call it Olympic. So why'd you switch? Wasn't my call. Wow, okay. Wait, so what did you do? Did you fuck up or something? It's complicated. Meaning what? Meaning, it's fucking complicated. Just like every other fucking thing on this job. 2-11 in progress, 446 Hamilton. Lower canyon north of Kittredge. Shots fired, shots fired. Officers need assistance.

How long you guys known each other? Since we were kids. High school. Can you trust her? Hey, I'm serious, man. Can you trust her? What kind of question is that? It's a legitimate one. I married her, didn't I? What, that's funny? Hey, just 'cause you love somebody don't automatically mean you can trust 'em. I've loved girls I wouldn't trust any further than I can throw 'em. I can trust her. Yeah? She keeps texting ya how do you know it ain't 'cause she got some other guy in her mouth? Wants to make sure you don't come walking through the door any time soon. Hey man, fuck you. That's my wife you're talkin' about. So what? You think that means you can let your guard down? You think that ring goes around her finger all the sudden this force field goes up around her suddenly she's impervious to outside dick? You just wanna fucking stop talking about my wife? I'm just sayin', you've known each other since high school. You don't think she's the least bit curious what some other guy tastes like? You don't know, do ya? Nobody knows anybody, not like that. You got a fucked up way of looking at things, man. Only person you really know is yourself. If you're lucky. A strong arm robbery just occurred near intersection of West 11th and South Alvarado Street. Suspect is a hispanic male, 5'10", medium build, white tank top, blue sweat pants. Last seen heading North bound on Alvarado Street on foot. Go time, that's us. 14 responding. All right, we're on Westlake right now, we can cut over at Olympic, try to cut him off. Dispatch tells you where it went down, which way he was headed, right? The idea is you want to contain him. Okay? We respond to a hot prowl like this, you want to go lights off. When we see this guy, we get him out in the open, you be ready, okay? Mm-hm. And watch his hands, I'm serious. You Watch his fucking hands. This guy reaches, does anything funny...

What's that? 25 years in a black and white. No offense, I just don't think I could do it. Same thing, night in, night out. Same wheel, same dashboard, same thing out the window, same damn patrol, every night. Hey, hey, man. You kiddin' me, I fuckin' love it in here. This car is home. Last 25 years, I've spent a third of my life in one of these. Anything I got goin' on, any bad shit I got happenin' outside this car disappears the second I close that door. I just don't think it's for me, you know? I think I get enough time under my belt, I'm gonna move into central. TAC unit. Right? Yeah, how'd you know? 'Cause you're 29. Fuckin' heavy artillery, the armor, and those super cool balaclavas things they wear... The whole thing gives ya half a chub. I just wanna make my own name, you know, that's all. Sure. And you figure a shooter's nest with a .50 cal full of high points is the way to do it, right? I don't know, maybe. The old man must have cast a hell of a shadow. 14, you copy? I've got two brothers on the job too. One's a cop up in West Valley, the other one's an investigator in the D.A.'s office in Sacramento. Somebody asked me one time, is it in the blood? I told 'em we were all too fucked up to do anything else. Hey, they oughta put that on a recruiting poster. Ray it's Don. Go to channel eight for me. Yeah, Don, go ahead. I did that welfare check you wanted on Jim Peters' wife. It's bad man. She's back on that shit again. Been in and out of some kind of program. Looked like the state was gonna take the kid, so she put her with someone she used to work with. Girl eventually took off. No one's seen her in at least a month. Ray, you there? Yeah. Do me a favor Don. Have a black and white go pick up the mother and let me know when they got her. You got it, man. What was that all about? Nothing. Why'd he do that off the open channel? When you need to know somethin', I'll tell ya. All right? There he is. Saw you over here, didn't realize you were back out on the street. Jack. Ray Mandel. Back in the saddle. LA can sleep easy, right? Is that Stroke? What's up, Ray-Ray? What, are you guys jerkin' each other off in there or what? Yeah, look at that. What, they got you breakin' in a cherry tonight? What's up, you little rookie fuckwad? Hey don't be fucking' lookin' at me, boot! Eyes on the dash. You little fucking bitch. I'm just fuckin' with ya, kid. God damn! Boot can't take a joke? What's your name? It's Nick. Sorry, sorry. What's your name? Nick. I can't hear you! Yo. You guys hear about this Hollenbeck and Kittredge shit? Yeah. Huh? Woo! Them boys are serious. I would give my left God damned nut, those mother fuckers end up in Olympic. My dick gets hard just thinkin' about it. Hit me. Hey, junior, did Ray here tell you what happened to him? Why he ended up riding a desk for two months? That's all right. No, he didn't. Good story. You know that Gas 'n Sip over on West 3rd? Come on, Jack. Ray and Jim Peters walk in on three Smokes stickin' the place up. Fucking Peters, man, he just starts throwin' shots. Doesn't even identify himself, just starts shootin'. Fucking misses everything. And don't get me wrong, I fuckin' loved Peters, but even you got to admit, he was jumpy as fuck. Anyway, Smokes return fire, Ray takes two of 'em out, drops 'em. One of 'em sneaks out the back but one of 'em goin' down's got a shotgun. Right. Thing goes off... Practically takes Peters' God damned head off. You could see his... you could see his sinuses. It was grotesque. Anyway, rest of the scatter finds it's way into Ray's side, right? He fuckin' somehow manages to fall out of there. Bleeding everywhere and shit. Well, here comes the Smoke. Yeah, the one that jumped out the back. He remembers that his ride's up by the pump, comes around, Ray lines him up, boom. End of God damn story. Jesus. Get's better every time you tell it, Jack. Yes, play that, yes. Hey, you see that shit? Huh? We grabbed up this little junkie last week, right? Little motherfucker resisted. Can you believe that shit? Five foot seven and 130 pounds max, fuckin' scratches me, draws blood. All kinds of horrible shit I coulda caught. Fuckin' TB, fuckin' AIDS. Did he have anything? No. But that's not the fucking point. The point is, he coulda fuckin' had it and I coulda fuckin' caught it. Little motherfucker got kicked last night. We're out here lookin' for him. I'm gonna beat that little fuck within an inch of his life. I can't... I can't fucking wait. I'm gonna knock his fuckin' teeth out, haul him in, he's gonna have every fuckin' scumbag in holding waiting to skull fuck his little faggot ass. Don't forget. What? What the fuck is that? Gonna do a little work with this beauty tonight too, you know? Mm-hm, crazy shit, man. Everything's on the table tonight. Full on jailbreak. Jack. Come on, man. You sure that's a good idea? I think it's a great fuckin' idea, Ray. In fact, I've been power liftin' like a mother fucker all day. 310 pounds, 10 sets, 10 reps, power cleans, dead lift, bench press, just like the pro ball players. Got a guy there put me on a God damn program. And look at this. Look at this shit. Full tanning bed, full body wax, ladies love that shit and I got five in my stable, five nights a week and they like it long and fuckin' strong. Fuck, I'm a sculpted piece of fuckin' iron. Yo, boot, you know this dude was in Afghanistan, right? Ah, don't start with that. Nah man, this dude, four years. Armored cavalry. That shit's no joke. Yeah, yeah I bet. It's no different than this, really. I mean, maybe in scope, you know? But you're out here rollin' these streets, these nights? It's just like Kandahar, fucking Ghazni. I'm tellin' ya, man, it's a war out here. It's a fuckin' powder keg and that wick is just fuckin' burning. Ssss. It's gonna be a full God damn battle zone. It's gonna be tanks in the streets that thing goes boom. It's gonna be us against them. Gonna be fuckin' beautiful. Anyway, upshot is, I'm in your patrol zone tonight. So, I thought I'd give you a heads up. Ray. Rook. Hey, Rook! Try and keep your dick dry. Jesus Christ, was that guy for real? That was Jack VanZandt. Every year he gets a little more like that. He's a total speed freak. He's all 'roided out too. That is a bad combination. Some of the guys think we oughta start a pool on exactly how he's gonna off himself. 20-L-14... I'm thinkin', pew. Please proceed to 226 Elmhurst for a notification. What are ya kiddin' me? What about traffic homicide? Negative 14, detectives still on scene. Shit. He was local. Who? That burnt up piece of meat back on South Vermont. The guy in the car. 14, please acknowledge. 14 en route. Yeah, I was hopin' he lived somewhere outside our zone. Why's that? Because now, we get to go notify his next of kin. I'm sorry, ma'am. Let's get the fuck out of here. Hey, is what VanZandt said about the convenience store thing true? The way it went down, I mean. I Don't know. Kinda. I did drop the two guys in the store but I didn't know what the fuck I was shooting at. The guy outside, he was pure luck. I wiped my eyes coming out the door, didn't realize I had blood all over my hands. I couldn't see shit. True enough, what happened to Jim Peters though. You guys ride together long? 10 years. Damn. You know, you're in a squad car with somebody that long, you get close. Or you wanna murder 'em in their sleep. Or both. So, you becoming an FTO, that have something to do with the convenience store? Yeah. I guess. I don't get it. A squad's kinda like a pack, right? Bunch of alphas. And so, one of 'em starts limping, the rest of the pack kills it off. Nobody says nothin' 'bout it. You see 'em in the squad it's just like it always was but they know it. They can smell it on you. You're damaged goods. Why didn't you just put in your papers, man? You know, take a full medical plus 25 years, you woulda been set. I dunno. What else am I gonna do? You see guys leave the job, they don't know what the fuck to do with themselves. You know? One day you're a fucking king out here and the next, you're just another guy. 20-L-14, this is Olympic-9, we have your suspect here. One, Tracy Peters. We've got her at 5th and Normandy if you want to connect, over. Yeah, 14, en route. En route. I actually grew up right around here. MacArthur park? Yep, right over there between Grand and Ocean. Shit. When I was a kid you could still walk around anywhere back then. You had the old theater over there on Alvarado. You got the lake on the other side of 7th over there. Man, you know, they drained that lake in '87 they found ten guns. They drained it again 15 years later, they found 300. Makes you wonder. So your old man's LAPD, what'd you end up in Oakland for? My parents split up when I was 10. My mom's family was from Oakland, so we ended up there. Then I got back down here four years ago, did the academy. Couldn't get on the job down here so I ended up back up North. Yeah, in General Services, right? Scurity detail. Yeah, my first three years, yeah. I was uh... I basically, sat in a chair outside the Budget Director's office all day. I was a fucking security guard. Then my wife got into grad school at USC so we decided to come back down here. Three years under my belt, this is my first night on the street. It took me three fuckin' years to become an actual cop. Yeah, I was surprised. What do you mean? I didn't know we had a spot. Olympic. Patrol, I mean. What? I didn't trade on my old man's name to get down here. Hey, hey. I didn't say you did. I get sick of hearing that shit. Everywhere I go, oh, you're Nick Holland's kid. Like I'm looking for a free pass or something. She likes to worry about me. She checks in every couple hours, it's our good luck thing. What are you superstitious? What, you're not? What? What about the thing you're wearin' around your neck? What, this? My St. Anthony medal? Yeah, that's not superstitious? You know who St. Anthony is? No. He's the patron saint of finding things and lost people. Hm, sounds like a cop. I put this on every day before I go on shift. I see it in the mirror, it reminds me of what I'm doing out here. 459 burglary in progress. North San Fernando and Merced, any available units please 10-98. Fuck. She give you any trouble? Little bit. EDP call goes out, we respond. As soon as we arrive, we can see she's on something. Now what it sounds like she tries to skip out on the bill and things get a little rough between her and the manager, and the mutt she was in here with. We got 'em separated, wanted to hold her 'til you got here. No. Fuck you, Ray. You can't keep doing this shit. Jim is fucking dead. You can't keep... This is fucking stupid. I told that asshole I didn't have any money, that I had to go to the ATM. But he wouldn't fucking let me go. And then he started putting his hands all over me, he started grabbing me. You see this? Look, it's already started fucking bruising. You see that? No, no. I know what you're gonna do. You'd gonna go what you always fucking do. You can't keep doing this. Floyd is a good person.

Take it easy, ma'am. You think I don't know what you're thinking but I do because I can see it and you're looking at me and you're thinking that she's crazy but I've had these people following me for the last three years and now they've got these drones and they've got these nano bugs and they can hear everything that I'm saying and then I think that they're trying to kill me and nobody cares...

Jesus Christ. 20-L-14, I got uh... en route with a 10-15, officer involved assault. Roger that, 14. Fuck the police! How many times have you had to discharge that on duty? Fuckin' throws you don't it? Almost havin' to pop somebody? Yeah, it does. Five. In 25 years? Yep. Once, 22 years ago in Filipinotown, I was Traffic stop in North Hollywood, the second time. Twice in '08. Fifth time was that Gas 'n Sip a couple months ago. Right. Back when I started out the only thing they'd outfit you with was a four shell 1100 and an eight shot .45. Nobody carried anything high capacity. The only guys who did was SWAT. Nobody had to wear a fuckin' vest. It's a different world out here now. What was it like back then? It was different. You started out in Rampart, right? You had a little more leeway back then, you know, you didn't have some armchair lawyer with a cellphone camera on every street corner just lookin' for you to fuck up. Now you guys coming up, pretty soon they're gonna slap that fuckin' body cam on ya. Suddenly you got no room to work, you know? You guys will be too terrified to do any real obs work. You just sit here and work the box, make your numbers, put some Franks in the tank. They've even been phasing out all the old Crown Vics. You know that? In two years, all gone. Different job now. You ever carry a throw down piece? I don't think that's the kind of question you should be askin'. I mean, it's just a question. Look man, it's a can of worms. I just hear some guys do. That's all. You got a guy does home invasions, right? Does this one house, husband, wife, two little girls. Ties 'em up, decides he's gonna go all the way on this one on this one he goes full Viking. Okay, rapes the wife and the two little girls right in front of the husband, douses the place with accelerant, and burns 'em all alive. Oh my God. Hundred different leads out on this asshole. Some cop gets the drop on him coming out of some ex-girlfriend's basement. Has him. This fuckin' guy is unarmed. All right? It's in that moment this cop finds out. Finds out what? What he can and cannot live with. A guy has to make a call like that, I'm not gonna judge 'em one way or the other. So take him in. Keep a clean conscience. Don't let him win. Yeah? It's that easy, is it? How is it hard? I'm sayin' that's me, I'd take him in. All right and you know that to a certainty? I don't think I know anything to a certainty. That's all I'm sayin'. You don't know how you gonna react to somethin' until you're in the middle of it, yeah? So, you take steps, carry a throw down piece, you know, whatever, you keep your options open. My dad never really talked about any of it. The job I mean, not to any of us. Thing I remember, was my dad sittin' on the couch watching TV. He'd come home, pretend you weren't there, dinner, he wouldn't say anything... My mom got sick of that eventually, I guess. So, you still see your old man? No. Well once after high school, that was about it. If you weren't on the job he didn't give a shit. He doesn't know my wife, won't know my kid. He wouldn't give a shit one way or the other. I was thinkin' about that the other day. What would it be like, right? You have this little baby, you're holdin' 'em in your arms, it's nothin' but unconditional love. And they get older and they want absolutely nothing to do with you. I lose sleep over that, man. I have this little girl and she ain't even born yet. I'm worried someday I'm gonna do something so stupid that she's never gonna wanna see me again. Look at this fuckin' guy. This is cool. Yeah, you like it? You're out on patrol, you wanna think of your zone like a habitat, right? You wanna keep it healthy, keep it peaceful. You got a wild animal loose in your habitat, you got a problem. What's the deal with you guys anyway? Fucking guy's off the rails half the time, he knows I know it. A guy like him, nobody ever calls him on his shit. Fuck, I can't believe we're on the same job as this guy. He ain't on my fuckin' job. Thanks. Whoa, what the fuck. Aw, shit. Stay here. What are you talkin' about, I'm coming with you. Just stay in the God damn car. Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa! What the fuck? You want 50,000 volts stuck up your ass? 'Cause I will tase the shit out of you. Calm down, okay? Get back. Knock it the the fuck off. Get back, back up. Yo Jack she said you had a small dick! Everybody calm the hell down! Think you can grab my tit like that asshole?! Oh now we didn't like it? Now we don't like it? What the fuck! Don't touch her! Well, then go home! 20-L-14 I'm gonna need a couple of units at Normandy and Westmont. Sir, I'd like to make a complaint, right now.

Hey, I'm not saying that. Of course I wouldn't do that, you know that. The way I hear it, these people like to cycle kids in and out. They don't want anyone figuring out a routine. Illegals too. When they're finished with 'em they put 'em on a van or something. Remember the alert that went out on that truck that burned up in Indio a couple weeks ago? A bunch of wets tied up inside, three of 'em were kids. Probably the same kinda deal. Well I got to... hey. Okay, can I, I got to, baby, I got to call you back later, okay?

What are you talkin' about? That shit I said about Peters. He was a fuck up, couldn't see straight with Tracy. I was talking about me. They'd already been married a year, she had Kailey and we let him think it was his. Okay? He was my partner. I loved him. I wasn't gonna let him get hurt like that, for fuck's sake. It's not like I'm proud of it. Oh, fuck. Man, I look at you, I see me 20 years ago. I look at me, I see what I am. There's a person you wanna be when you're young and there's a person you end up being. That's a hard reality to face, man. But there it is. 20-L-14, back in service. Roger that, 14. Got a little worried about you there. Do you require assistance? Yeah, sorry about that Olympic. We ran out of gas. Sent the rook to fill up the can, he got lost. Roger that, 14. Shift's almost over. Shit, look at this fuckin' guy. Just rolled a red right in front of us. You want it? Sure, why not. Driver, pull over to the side of the road please. I got it. Okay, genius 20-L-14, traffic.

Did I roll that stop light back there? You know, I'm sorry about that. I didn't see it. Yeah, you did roll that stoplight. You realize you have a brake light that's out as well? Oh man, I'm gettin' it handled tomorrow. Okay, do you have a driver's license and registration that I can see, please? You really have to do that? I mean, I just live a block down the street and I'm just tryin' to get home. It's a little late... Okay. I got the big guy in here. Do you have your driver's license and registration on you? Yeah, you know what, it's on the counter. Forgot it on the way out. Okay, who's this? Oh, he's just... How you doin' sir? He's had one too many. You got a name, buddy? He's had one too many. What, he can't speak for himself? Look, we just one block to go and we are out of here. I'll get that light checked out. Thank you very much. Okay, could you step out of the car for me, please? Hey man, look, I like cops... Do you mind steppin' out of the car for me, please? Seriously? It's just a little stoplight and it seems a little ridiculous. I really am just... Driver. Step out of the car, now! Seriously, man, why you got to make a fuckin' federal case out of this shit. I'm not gonna ask you again. Put your hands out at the side and step out of the car, now. Okay, boss man. Just openin' the door. Whoa, whoa, whoa!! Drop that fucking gun, asshole. Fuck you! Do it, now! Drop the gun now! Do it, now! Fuck you. Do it, now! I'll pull this fucking trigger I swear to Christ. I told you not to get me stirred up. Eddie! Eddie, God damn it, say something. Fuck! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Because after tonight, you're either gonna figure this out and you're gonna learn how to do this job or you're not and this job is gonna eat you alive. You remember what I told you when you came on shift? There is the world inside this squad car and there's everything else outside of it. You're out on patrol, every person you see that's not in a uniform is either somebody whose been in the back of your squad car or somebody who hasn't been in the back of your squad car yet. I'm not just talking about catches, I'm talkin' everybody. Everyone who's not a cop. You're not a part of them anymore. It is us against them. You understand that? You are the sheep dog, they are the sheep. You could save somebody's ass, they could turn around and hang you out in a heartbeat. That's the trade. You read 1984 in high school? People sleep peaceably in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. People sleep peaceably in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf and they will fucking hate you for it. That's the deal. It's the deal you made when you signed up for this. See you tomorrow.
