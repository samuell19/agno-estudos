♪ Please, Mister President, tell us of the contest. Yes, tell us! Tell us! In the year of our lord, 1672, The Horticultural Society of Amsterdam announces a contest. A prize of 100,000 guilders will be awarded-- (clapping) at the annual Tulip Festival, for the first Dutchman who can grow a perfect black tulip! It can't be done. Impossible. You may as well offer one million guilders. No one can grow a black tulip. ♪ Hear ye. The black tulip must be perfect. No speck of color or variation. The prize for the first black tulip will be 100,000 guilders. Hear ye. What did you say, sir? One hundred thousand guilders, Mr. van Baerle. For a tulip? A black tulip. Thank you very much. Good luck, my little tulip. You may not be black, but you will surely be beautiful. (ringing) (laughing) Hans and Jeremy, my little friends! You were very nearly planted with this bulb. I wonder what would have emerged next spring? A mouse flower? (laughing) I told you we shouldn't have gotten into that hole, Hans. We were only helping Cornelius, Jeremy. You worry too much. Mr. Boxtel, have you heard about the tulip contest? One hundred thousand guilders for the first-- I know, I know! Black tulip! Bah! I, Cornelius van Baerle will grow the black tulip, Mr. Boxtel. Of that, I am certain. Black flower, red flower, what do I care? Flowers are of no importance. Here, I have the secret of turning common mud into gold! That's more important than black flowers!

I am most eager to calculate the steps I must take to create a black tulip. I have heard of the contest and feel certain you can do it. But as for now, I seek a favor. Merely ask it, godfather. All I have is yours. Keep this safe for me and inform no one of its whereabouts. Consider it done. What could be so important that-- You must not ask me what is in the package. For your own safety, you must remain ignorant of its contents. Of course, godfather. This is opened only by myself. It will be safe here. You look exhausted. Perhaps a brandy would revive you. Ah, yes, my boy. Thank you. (creaking) (birds chirping) ♪ Cornelius will be pleased when he sees how we've tidied up after him, won't he, Jeremy? Yes, Hans. Only, be careful with that-- Ooh! ♪ Spade. Jeremy, look! Brisket's heading for the roof. I do wish he'd stay on his side of the fence. Still, he's not bothering us. The doves, Jeremy. The doves are at the river getting water!

Yes, oh, yes. Yes, I've got it all! What? What's this? Plus, a maiden of pure heart. And, most importantly, a flower, black as midnight and without imperfection? Oh, curses! I almost had it all.
