Him and his partner arrested me for no reason. That ain't true. He had weed and crystal meth paraphernalia. I had Drano. And the weed was his. They beat the shit out of me for trying to unclog a toilet. - You think I did this to myself? - You're such a dick, Carl. What? You're gonna listen to him? Look at him. Then look at me. Sheriff, Sheriff! Sheriff! What are we gonna do? We're gonna get a time machine, Billy. And I'm gonna go back in time to when my cousin was dating your mother. And then I'm gonna yank his pecker off, right before he has the chance to create an idiot. My guess is, that's for you. Hello? Well, looks like we got a situation here. Yeah. Yeah, I'd say we do. You're shooting up the place, and there's innocent people here. Who am I talking to here? - This the suspect? - No. The suspect's your guy in here on the floor. Hey. You talking about Carl Hooker? Yeah, that's him. - Why the hell are you shooting at us? - I'll tell you what. Why don't you come out, and we'll talk about it? I promise you that you'll be safe. Yeah, I trust you. Every cop in this fucking town's insane. Now, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen a star in the east, and have come to worship him." Elias, say your line. Fear not, baby God. Lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them. Until it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. When they came into the house, they saw a young child with Mary, his mother. ...law enforcement officers yesterday. Damn it, we have a situation. ...inside Vicente's Liquor Mart. - Come on! - Let's go. This is the situation. Now, Carl, he radioed in before he entered the place. But he never said who he was chasing, or for what reason. We have no idea where all these hostages are located. They could be back by the liquor cabinet. They could be there by the ice machine, they could be back there in the crapper, or in Vicente's office. Hell, we don't even know who are the hostages and who's the hostage-taker. Now, you said that you thought maybe that this kid you arrested, - that he could be the gunman? - Yes. Yes. I mean, I'm fairly certain. Although, I... I do believe I saw two white males, twenties, duck behind the counter. And... I mean, this one's... This is crazy, but I... I thought I saw a little kid. Jesus, Billy. Are you sure? I can't be positively positive for sure. But I... I'll tell you this. There's definitely four or five folks in there, maybe. Well, this is a clusterfuck. All right, Billy... you're the second-in-command. I want you to find out all you can. And make sure that you secure this entire area. You got that? Absolutely, boss. Second-in-command, let's do this. Is he okay? You got yourself in a real mess here. What's your game plan? I'm just trying not to get anybody killed. Then put your gun down, your hands up, and walk outside. No, no, that would be a bad idea. Whoever walks out that door becomes a target. I've seen this before. Doesn't end well. You think you're right. He thinks you're wrong. You lose. Then let me state the obvious. You, sir, have shot a law enforcement officer. And you, you think you're not a criminal? I've never heard of good people that hold hostages. And you shooting at my car, trying to kill me. What's that? That is my word against yours. You see how this works now? Okay. Okay! Here's what we know for certain. Vicente Santos is the owner of Vicente's Liquor Mart, and as such, he's probably on the scene. I think maybe Kate Daniels is working the counter today. I called her house and didn't get an answer, so... I'd deduce she's inside as well. Which led me to further deduce... that the little boy inside, if in fact there is a little boy, probably her son, Seth. Okay. Run the plates on all these vehicles here. Already did that. First, we got Vicente's pickup truck, the blue Dodge. You got that little shitbox import, that's Kate Daniels' car. Carl's patrol vehicle's down the road, and it appears to have been in some kind of altercation. And then we have the Chevelle. That's Eric Norris'. Now that's the suspect that Carl and I tangled with last night. He may or may not be the hostage-taker. - Did you hit your head or something? - No. You're starting to act like a damn police officer. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You want me to re-establish contact with the inside? No. I just want to sit here and think for a minute. All right, 'cause I could function as a negotiator, establish a rapport maybe. It's not a damn movie, Billy. You're not Samuel fucking Jackson. Wow. Look at that. This is cool. Man, looks bad. Yeah. It's a security camera. Yeah, everything's on tape. You with my gun, and you shooting at me. - You're on it too, asshole. - Hey, where are the controls? My office in the back. - I'll show you where they are. - I'll show him. Fine. Holy shit, they're everywhere. Yeah, is that a surprise? Oh, God. Look, you want my advice? If you didn't do anything, just turn yourself in. Turn myself in? To the same cops that are shooting at us for no reason? Yeah. You're holding two old men and my child hostage. At least let them go. I will. I'm gonna let you all go. I swear. What are you doing here anyway? What'd you come here for? To find someone. - Yeah? Who? - A man. - What man? - Does it really matter? Yeah, it does matter. My father used to live here. Or he still does. I don't know, so I came here to try and find him. What, and you've never met him? No, I've never met him. Thought it might be a good time, being Christmas and all, but, in hindsight, that wasn't such a good idea. Oh, goody, goody, TV. We can watch Die Hard. That's a great Christmas movie. Vicente's Hostage Mart. Merry Christmas! - I'm not talking to them. - Mm... Hey, what are you doing? Talk to me. You got 30 minutes to release all hostages. If you don't release them, we are gonna gas this place. I advise that you surrender any women and children forthwith. You done yakking? Now listen up! Okay, and who is this? - The guy you're talking to. - Don't say anything stupid. Are you a hostage? We want money, lots of money. Do-re-mi. Big bills. Christmastime, we didn't get any packages, we're all pissed off in here. Unmarked and none of that blue dye or anything. Bye. Seriously? What the fuck is wrong with you? - I have always wanted to do that. - You're out of your goddamn mind. - You better call them back. - They're at 911. - They're gonna think you're part of this. - They're not. It's a bunch of dumb shits out there. Well, that was an older man. That wasn't that kid I spoke to earlier. You saying it was an older man? That's what I just said. - Okay. - So, who the hell is who in there? Well, here's what we know. Vicente Santos is the owner of Santos Liquor Mart, and as such... Damn it, I know what you got written in your little notebook there, Sherlock. That wasn't Vicente, and it sure as hell wasn't Carl. Well, I don't have a vehicle for an old-timer. - I got Vicente's blue pickup... - Did you talk to that reporter yet? - No. - What the hell you waiting for? Okay. I'm hungry. I think we should eat. The peanuts just aren't doing it. Come on. What do you say? We are live, outside of Vicente's Liquor Mart in El Camino, in the midst of what appears to be a hostage situation on Christmas Eve. Authorities cannot confirm the identities of the hostages. - However, Action 19 News has learned... - Oh, my grace. ...that Deputy Carl Hooker, of El Camino's sheriff's department, is trapped inside the mart. So, Carl, why don't you tell us what really happened last night? You'll find out in court, or at his funeral. He don't know the truth at this point. Come on. Give us the truth. - We're all friends here. - What good is the truth? The truth will set you free. Set us free. I mean, you're a drunk, we all know that. - It's a small town. - You're a drunk. Yeah, but I don't hide behind a badge. I don't drink and drive. You ran a red light. - He had narcotics in his system. - Yeah? - What'd you have in your system? - Had a little blonde girl in my system. How about that? Ha! - That's disgusting. - Tell you what, Carl. Tell everybody here what really happened last night, and I'll walk outside and surrender right now. Is there anything else you can tell us about the people in the store when you were shopping? Not really. Hello, ma'am. I'm with the sheriff's department. Oh, my! They hide that well on TV. - Beth Flowers. - Oh, I know. Billy Calhoun. Deputy Billy Calhoun. Second-in-command here on the scene. May I ask you a few questions? - Yes, ma'am. That's why I'm here. - Fantastic. Deputy Calhoun, do you have any idea who the gunman is? Do you have a name? A suspect? Uh, well, me and my partner and I, Deputy Carl Hooker, H-O-O-K-E-R, - arrested a young man last night. - And what was he arrested for? He was drug running. Methamphetamine, we imagine. We had the suspect, Mr. Eric Norris, under surveillance because he fit a profile - with a gold credit card. - Eric Norris... - Drano. - ...you said? Well, it's just a feeling you get when you've been doing this as long as we have. It's like a sixth sense. - Off the record. - Right. Right. So, the suspect posts bail and was released? Not exactly. No, ma'am. He escaped. - Escaped from? - From our facilities. County jail? Yes, ma'am. How does that happen, exactly? You know, we just... We want to get everyone outta here safely, and reunited with their loved ones before this very special holiday. All right. This is Beth Flowers reporting from... If you have any further questions, I will be on scene. Just look for... Okay. This is Beth Flowers, reporting live from Vicente's Liquor Mart. I'm gonna need some medical attention. Start talking. Oh, you're gonna have a dead cop on your hands, you don't get me out of here soon. That's... that's life in prison. He's right. Dead pig... no es bueno. I just want my life back. I wanna rewind before I ever came here. You can do that. I'm just gonna tell them what happened. You know? Everybody's got their own truth. - You know? - Yeah. Only one of them's right. Only God knows. He probably knows you don't know shit. The fuck you know, Vicente. Remember when your alarm went off? I was the first one to arrive here. You were home... taking care of your sick wife. Remember? Huh? I saved your business. And you, blondie. Who'd you come running to... when your boyfriend was slapping you around? Hmm? I ran that ingrate outta town. And you, you fucking drunk, with your goddamn Vietnam sob story. I been cleaning all your messes. All y'all's. See, that's my truth. You, son, are a bad seed. I'm just doing my job. What's your truth? My mom passed away. I found a letter from my father. I never met the guy. So, I came here to try to close a loop. And that's when you came along. Well, damn. It's a Christmas miracle, right here on County Road 191. Folks, who wants a beer? You got any of that Bud Lemon? Bud Light Lemon, that's my favorite. Got it. Got it, buddy. Ooh, ooh.

You see that barricade over there? The one that you just walked over? How would you like to spend Christmas on a four-by concrete pad? Sheriff, we're going national. This is a live feed. So, you either cooperate and answer the questions, or we report it as we see it. It's up to you. All right. I'll give you one comment. Sheriff, at exactly what time did Eric Norris escape your custody? We can't comment on that at this time. We also have not released any statement indicating that one Eric Norris is responsible for this situation. What exactly are you sure of, Sheriff? I'll tell you what we know here. There is a criminal in that liquor mart. And he's holed up in there with numerous hostages. Exactly how many hostages, we can't be certain at this time. Now, you get your ass behind that barricade. Yes, sir. Thank you so much, sir. I really appreciate it. This is gonna get us live. Seth needs to go to the bathroom. All right. Fine. Anybody else? I'm good. Piss on you. Come on. Keep close. Keep your heads down. In there. Why'd you wait so long to come looking for him? Uh... I didn't know anything about him. My mom never talked about him. I found all these letters that he wrote to her. Must have been a hundred of 'em. And I just couldn't get him out of my head. Yeah, I didn't know my dad much either. He bolted right after I was born. So, it's been a revolving door of step-men ever since. Psst. Hey. Psst! Psst! Hey. - Psst! - The fuck's wrong with you, Carl? Hey, man. Go on. I got a .22 in the small of my back. What the fuck? - Get that for me. - I hate to tell you, I'm tired, huh. Huh? Hey, listen to me. Listen! You think we're gonna get out of here alive? That boy, if he's a good person, he'd have let us go a long time ago. Now, I ain't gonna hurt no one. Look at me. Look at me, bro. I'll give you my word. Look, look, I'll give you my word. You're crazy if you don't think you need some kind of protection. You're crazier if you think that your shop ain't gonna get fucked up beyond repair when this thing blows up. So, come on, hey, hey. Oh, god damn it. Come on, get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get it, get it, get it. You need some help with that? Let me see it. I used to love these things. Ah, yeah, see? You see this little thing right here? Pull that out a little bit... and your batteries won't pop out every time you run into something. All right, try it now. I think I'm gonna let everybody outta here. It's the only good thing left to do. Now, listen to me, boys. The truth of the matter is, we can't negotiate with a crazy person. So, when this goes down, you are just gonna have to keep your cool. Son of a bitch. Just give me that goddamn thing. Frank, you're going through the front with me. Billy, you and Garret, you cover that back window. Now, listen to me. He can't get out that window, but that don't mean he can't shoot your ass from there, - so you watch it. - Roger that. Now, we are gonna resolve this thing before those damn Feds show up, swinging their dicks around. This is our town. And we're gonna settle it. Whose is that? Oh, sounds like my boss. Now, go ahead and answer it. Tell him we're all coming out. Yeah? Take my handcuffs off. I'll bite your head off. I'll bite your head right off. Do the right thing, Carl. Let's see here. Yello. Carl, what you got in there? I got six people. One's a kid. All right, listen up. You try to get everybody down on the floor, Carl. 'Cause in exactly two minutes... we're coming in. - Asshole's trying something funny. - What are you doing? - Oh, he's going crazy now. - You son of a bitch. - Help me, help me, help me! - Give me that. Ah, fuck. We have a tragic story developing in the town of El Camino, Nevada. A group of Christmas shoppers, caught in a liquor mart, have been taken hostage. Our regional correspondent, Beth Flowers, is live on the scene for us. Beth, can you tell us more about the events that are unfolding down there? Yes, Soledad. Christmas Eve has turned into a nightmare for a group of people being held hostage in the liquor mart behind me. El Camino County Sheriff's Patrol responded to a distress call by one of their own. We believe Vicente Santos and Kate Daniels are also being held captive. I'm here with Jewels Daniels. Ms. Daniels, you believe your daughter is inside the mart. Is that true? Yes. Yes, I do. She has my grandson with her. He's only five. Do it! Do it! Hey, you guys, get away from the window. Get in the aisle, now. Stay down. - What's happening, Carl? Shut up, Vicente. You gave me your word, man. Get down! Cover that kid's head! Shit. - He's doing something. Eric! - No! - He's got a gun! - Eric! Hell no! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! No! Shots fired! - Drop your weapon! - No, no, no! He's got a gun! - No, don't shoot! - Vicente! Don't shoot! Man down! Hold your fire! - Hold your fire, damn it! - Vicente! Vicente! Hey, you're bleeding, man. Oh, shit! Oh! Hey. Oh, listen. I think it's just... You're gonna be all right. Beth! Are you okay? Just sit up, if you can. All right? There you go. This is some mess you've gotten yourself into, Sheriff. Whole country's been watching this stupidity unfold. Why don't you wait behind the barricade? It's like a fucking war zone in here, man. Yeah, friendly fire. Hell on earth. This is gonna hurt a little bit. - All right. Ready? - Yeah. Ready? Here. Come on, put some pressure on it. Hmm. Christmas, 1960... 69, Vietnam. The Valley of Death. I called the coordinates. One-five-four-seven north, one-zero-eight-three-six east. Just, there was a village, nothing there... but farmers and families. So, I aborted the artillery strike. And then artillery started raining down on us. Twenty-two soldiers dead, 78 civilians, and they blamed it all on you. I read your letters. Twenty-two of the bravest men I've ever met, just doing what they were told, what I told them to do. I spent a great deal of my life trying to make it up to those... those guys. Find some sort of truth in all this. I lost it at every turn. And I was... I got court-martialed over it. I lost my house and my money and my self-respect. Your wife. Your mother deserved more than that. Yeah, she did. So did you. Yeah. Ah, it was a good Christmas, though. Tell you what... this was a close second. Here... answer it. You guys should get outta here. Hello? This is Special Agent Patterson. Who is this? Kate Daniels, I work here. My son, Seth, is here, and we're going to be coming out. So, please don't shoot. Okay, you got my word, Kate. You and Seth are safe to come out. Now, Kate, the gunman, is he alone? Has he been shot? Yeah. No. I don't know. You and Seth come on out. We'll handle it from there. Okay, he's sending out two hostages. The girl and her son! Lower your firearms! Here's to Eric and Kate. You guys look good on each other. What is it? Here you go, little man. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, those were... Those were really great words. Really great. Be careful. Okay. Okay. Look at me, okay? - Look at me. - Love and turmoil. Best combination known to man. You should probably go, too. Nah, are you kidding? I'm gonna stick around. This is the most fun I've had in years. Hmm... Kate Daniels and her son are exiting the liquor mart, and they are safely in the hands of authorities. Oh... You all right? No! Apparently, we're having some technical issues - in El Camino. - Settle down. We'll get Beth Flowers back as soon as we can. Well, they'll be coming in now. I'm sure they've done the math, right? Six minus four equals two. So, either you're the bad guy, or it's me. I'm the only one that hasn't been shot. I'm just gonna tell the truth. The truth is a tricky son of a bitch. What do you want for Christmas? To get out of here, for one. Well, no ask is too big for the spirit of the holidays. That's what I say. You know what? Christmas is over too quick. It's all the buildup... and then, bam. Tree's all dried out. Family leaves. And there's shit everywhere. You know, Eric Norris... ...you're a good man. Maybe I did something right. What are you doing? Well, it's not often a guy gets a chance to right so many wrongs. Don't go out there holding the gun. Merry Christmas, Eric Norris. Sure was nice to meet you. Too bad we didn't meet earlier. Oh, the things we could have done. Larry. - He's coming out! - Don't go out there! Sir! This is the FBI. Step forward! Get on the ground! On the ground, now! Hey, take care of yourself. Put the gun down! Put it down, Larry! Listen, I've left one person in there that needs medical help. It's okay, we'll take care of him. Put the gun down! Larry, put it down! The life of man... solitary, poor... nasty, brutish... ...and short. No, no! Hold your fire! - Hold your fire! - No! It better be better up there, amigo. That's all I'm saying. That's... that's all... that's all I'm saying. That's all... that's all I'm saying. Oh... Oh my God, baby, what happened? What happened in there? Okay, honey. He's not... Ms. Flowers. Get us out! It hurts so bad! I don't want to smoke anymore. It's not who I am. I don't want to smoke anymore. It's not who I am. I have the willpower to choose my life. I have the willpower to change my life. Choose, choose. Choose, choose. Senator Allen, just today, admitted his relationship with the pharmaceutical giant was financially beneficial to both his campaign and his campaign staff. I'm Beth Flowers, reporting live from Austin, Texas. Back to you, Soledad. Oh, my goodness! Do it again! Do it again. Looks like tomorrow's gonna be hotter than two rats fucking in a wool sock. So, powder up your balls and stay inside. Powder up your balls! 'Cause they get sweaty. - So, you say they're back, are they? - I believe so. When you shine your light on them, they run off? - They sure did. - Not surprised. I'm gonna call animal control for you. Uh, raccoons are not really a police matter. Listen, I sure appreciate you putting this on your property. I'm gonna clean up El Camino. That's my promise.
