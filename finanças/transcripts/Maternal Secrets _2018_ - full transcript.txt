(eerie music) (audience applauding) Ladies and gentlemen, please help me welcome to the stage your new Delaware State Senator for District 11, Jackson Lewis. (audience applauding, cheering) JACKSON: My fellow Delawarians, I thank you for electing me into the venerable Delaware legislature to serve as your state senator. There are so many people here that I need to thank, and I simply would not be here without their love, loyalty and support. To my family, all of my supporters, and my amazing team, who have worked just incredibly hard these last few months putting in late nights, long hours, and sacrificing time with friends and family. Yes, I know. It's been... tough. But seriously, to the generous donors who've made this all possible, thank you. I truly appreciate you all. But, no more politics tonight. Tonight we celebrate. Thank you, Senator. REPORTER: I think I've gotten everything I need. - Thank you. - No problem. (sighs) Did I do okay? Wait. You're gonna tell me that I made it too casual, and I lost my... What do you call it? Position of Authority. And no, you did great. Congratulations. Thank you. Well, it's been a pleasure working with you. Oh. I see. Am I getting fired? No, but my job here is done. Well, I was thinking we could transition you from campaign manager to PR manager. Perhaps we can discuss later tonight? Sure. Now, make sure you come and find me. I will. You best get to the bar quick. James from Accounts says the bar tab stops at 300 dollars. Can I get you something? No, thanks. Hi. MAN: Terrific, thanks. Red wine, please. (cell phone ringing) This is Laura. MAN: Senator, as I was saying before, I think a point five increase is a small price to pay for better roads. Uh... one second, Steve. LAURA: I'm not feeling very well. Hey. Let me help you. I, um, I don't feel very well. I only had one. Well, I mean you're probably just tired from the campaign, and if you rest, you'll be fine. ♪ I hear the thunder clouds coming ♪ ♪ I see the blackened sky falling down ♪ ♪ Into this heavy night and running ♪ ♪ Across every street in this town ♪ ♪ I used to think that life was better ♪ ♪ When nothing broke and nothing bled ♪ ♪ But now I know those days are over ♪ ♪ Take me into the dark ♪ ♪ I'll come down the other side ♪ ♪ I'll come out a fresh start ♪ ♪ I'm ready for a change to be washed away ♪ ♪ They say that you can't have the rainbow ♪ ♪ If you can't make it through the rain ♪ ♪ And you can't hope to know what love is ♪ ♪ Until you've come to know some pain ♪ ♪ I think that I've been running far too long ♪ ♪ I used to feel that made me strong ♪ ♪ But now I'm going under ♪ ♪ Take me into the dark ♪ ♪ I'll come out on the other side ♪ ♪ I'll come out to a fresh start ♪ ♪ I'm ready for a change, to be washed away ♪ ♪ Take me into the night ♪ Over here, sweetie. ♪ I see you on the other side ♪ To the Fairmont Southampton, please. DRIVER: Yes sir. JACKSON: Oh, watch your step, Aubrey. DRIVER: Vacation? JACKSON: Yes, finally. Just a few days before I lose him in the next campaign. God, the light is so stunning. DRIVER: You have to check out Horseshoe Bay. And if you like seafood, Bermuda fish chowder is out of this world. Hah. Yeah, I don't know if she appreciates that too much. It seems the little one doesn't like seafood, and Aubrey's paying for it. DRIVER: Well, there's no excuse for not having our legendary Swizzle. JACKSON: Isn't that alcoholic? DRIVER: No, it's made of rum. It's medicinal. (laughs) ♪ I wanna get washed away ♪ ♪ Start over in a new place ♪ ♪ I wanna get washed away ♪ ♪ It's true ♪ ♪ Take me into the dark ♪ This is gorgeous! I don't feel like they should allow me in here. Well they wouldn't normally, but I had a word with some people, and they'll make an exception this time. Oh. Lucky me. Did you see his face? He looked terrified. I know. It's like he thought it was gonna bite him. That must be the oddest job he's had so far. Being personally responsible for a stuffed man-sized pillow. I hope you can live without it. You know I can't. I just can't make any promises it's gonna make it up to the room. I'm astonished it survived the flight. That is not funny! I seriously can't sleep without it. And if I can't sleep, then you can't sleep. (sighs) Vacations suit you. All week just you and me. Aubrey, let's have a toast to make everybody jealous. That is a very good idea. I'll go first. To our incredible relationship, and a very exciting future. (Jackson sighing) Oh, my God, you are so weird about that word. Relationships are something you have to work at. What we have is far better. So, how about to us and an amazing holiday? Our last one before the baby. Ooh. But it's not gonna be easy. We will have to work at being parents. I'll need to. You won't. You'll be amazing. And I think it will make me love you even more than I already do. If that's possible. Well that's very sweet, Jax. (classical piano music plays) Here are your club sodas. Would you like anything else? No, not for now, thanks. WAITRESS: First time in Bermuda? Yes. Well for me, anyway. Ah. Babymoon. We've got about eight weeks to go. Aw. Congratulations. You know I want to, but I just think what we have right now is perfect. It's just kinda hard to beat a city apartment. Why are you so stuck on staying in the city? I mean we could venture out just a little bit and get a proper house. But babies are tiny. Jackson. Be serious. I'm sorry, I just... feel like you're not ready for this. Wow. Look I just like my... our place. There's nothing more to it than that. And your family? We've been through this. AUBREY: I'm the mother of your child. I should know them. Look, we're just, we're just not close, all right. But soon, I promise. That when the time is right, you'll meet my mom. Am I a secret? Of course not, honey. Look it's just it's taking my mom a while to get used to the idea, but she'll come around. It's going to be totally different with our kid. We'll spend time together like a real family. Not like yours. I haven't seen a single family photo. My family. Look, when you meet my mom, you'll understand. She can be a little bit difficult. Well, she should be happy for us. When we get back, I'll call the realtors, and I'll set up more appointments, okay? Excuse me, can we get some more bread please? What have I done now? Nothing. Well, maybe it's just the hormones. JACKSON: All right, we're almost there. Almost there. Right here, right here. Take my arm, take my arm. Laura? Are you doin' okay? (knocking) Can you hear me? I'm just checking up on you. All right, I'm coming in. - AUBREY: Hey Jax? - Yeah. AUBREY: I'm not feeling so well. JACKSON: What's goin' on? I'm okay. I just, I think I'm gonna go up to the room and get out of the heat for a little bit. All right, I'm coming with you. No, no, no. Honestly, I'm okay. Stay here. I'm just gonna (sighs) get my feet up in the A.C. and come back and meet you for a swim. Are you sure? Uh-huh. JACKSON: Okay, if you're not back, I'm going to check up on you in half an hour, all right? Perfect. Love you. By the way, I know I've been a little crazy lately. I'm sorry. You know I don't mean it. Mwah! - WAITER: Mr. Lewis? - Yes. (water running) There you are, I've been looking for you. Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you were someone else. Hi, may I help you Miss? I'm just looking for my boyfriend. Hi. I can't seem to find my boyfriend. This is what he looks like. Have you seen him? His name is Jackson Lewis. GITA: No, I haven't seen him. Okay. I'm sure it's a simple explanation. I just can't get a hold of him. It's probably best if you wait in your room. Yeah. You're probably right. I'm sure he's going to show up any second and expect to head straight to dinner and then I'll be the one that's not ready. If we see Mr. Lewis, we will send him to his room. AUBREY (on phone): Jax, it's me. I... I don't know where you are. I've been calling and calling you. I've texted you a million times. Please, just call me. Text me and tell me you're okay. I'm worried about you. I... I have no idea where you are. Um... I guess I'll try you again. Love you. (sighs) OPERATOR: 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Police, yes. I'd like to report a missing person. My boyfriend, he... he has a condition. He has epilepsy. And normally he's fine, but it's triggered by stress. Ma'am, it's our policy that any case involving missing tourists gets our immediate priority. He's extremely private about his condition. He's in the public eye. He's in politics, so you can see that this can't get out. I understand. I think the first thing we're going to do is contact the hospital and see if there's been anyone admitted matching his description. We'll just take things from there, all right? Hi, I just spoke with hotel security and they have reviewed the surveillance footage. There has been no suspicious activity out by the pool this afternoon. Just guests coming and going. Take my private number. Give me a call if he gets in touch, and we'll be in communication. All right? ♪ To love is seeking ♪ ♪ But I never really thought ♪ ♪ Reason for all this pain ♪ ♪ And all this wasted time ♪ ♪ And I don't know ♪ JACKSON: Okay, if you're not back I'm gonna check up on you in half an hour, all right? AUBREY: Perfect. Love you. (cell phone ringing) Jax? It's Officer Andrews. I spoke with the hospital, and there have been no seizure patients, and no one admitted this afternoon that fits Mr. Lewis's description. We could take that as potentially good news. So, try and get some rest, and we'll look into this matter overnight. Thank you. (cell phone ringing) WOMAN: Aubrey? AUBREY: Mom! Jackson's gone. Gone? Where is he? He just sent me this... this email. He emailed you? I have it right here. He said "Aubrey, you're going to be very hurt "when you get this. "But I've had to go back home early to get some space. "It's unexpected, I know. "And you will probably want to kill me. "I will do the right thing by you and the baby, "but right now our relationship is moving too fast. Jackson." We're coming out to see you tomorrow. No. No, please don't, Mom. I need to figure this out on my own. - No, sweetheart. - I'm okay. I just, I can't talk about this anymore right now. Aubrey? Aubr... (sobbing) - Mr. Lewis? - Yes. - This is from Mrs. Lewis. - Thank you. (keypad clicking) WOMAN: Surprise. - (knocking) - WILLIAMS: Miss Ross. Miss Ross, are you there? Miss Ross, are you okay? ANDREWS: Miss Ross, are you and the baby all right? I... I... I got an email from Jackson. He's fine. "I know you'll probably want to kill me "but right now our relationship is moving too fast." Wait. Why would he say that? Sorry, I don't know what to tell you. Jax would never let us use that word. He didn't write that email. Someone else must have sent it. I'm sorry, Miss, but we're not going to be able to help you in this matter further. AUBREY: Why? You can help me. WILLIAMS: With what? Find out who really sent that email. Miss Ross, sometimes in cases like this, the best thing to do is to take things at face value as difficult as that seems, and I know deep down you believe that, which is why this is hitting you so hard. Don't tell me what I know. I don't know anything until I've seen proof that he's left the island. He didn't write that email. Paul, I need you to check a name through passport control for me. Check it against the exit list. Jackson Lewis. He entered the country six days ago. Okay, thanks. He's still here. Somewhere. (sobbing) AUBREY: Aah! (sobbing) Aubrey? Aubrey? Is that you? I was wondering if I was gonna run into you. How are you doing? Do you need a ride to the airport? What? Well I can take you. It'll save a taxi. You know I think this is all for the best really. Jackson just needs some space. Wait, Jackson? Who are you? Mrs. Lewis. Well, you can call me Rose. His mother. Oh, my God, I had no idea you were even here. He didn't tell you? Oh, that is so Jackson. Yeah. I'm so happy to meet you. Do you know where he is? ROSE: I do. Thank God, I've been looking everywhere for him. I've been worried sick about him. Well, he's fine. Shall we go? I'm sorry. I think there's been some sort of miscommunication. Is there something you're not telling me? Oh. Well, I think this is between you and Jackson. Right, but I can't find him. What's going on? I don't think it's really my place to... (clears throat) I should go. No, please. Mrs. Lewis, I have to see him. What's going on? Is it something I've done? Look, I know that you've had your concerns about us. I know things have moved really quickly, but we love each other very much. Jackson does not love you. He's with the woman he truly loves. I'm sorry. Are you talking about Samantha? Samantha Mason, the lawyer? I'm sure Jackson will do the right thing by you. He just needs some distance. Look. Go home. Be with your own family. (sighing) Sam? What are you doin' here? Happy to see me, Jay? A little under dressed, don't you think? You bought me this. Don't you remember? Okay. What are you doin' here? I missed you, I had to see you. Does my mom know that you are in her hotel room? Yes, she invited me. Where is she? She'll be here soon. Look, I'm gonna go. I'll come back when she's here. Just tell her to call me. Stay, just a little bit. I thought you'd be happy. Let's talk about this. Samantha, we have been through this time and time again. There is nothing left to say. You can't spare 10 minutes? Jackson, what is wrong with you? Why are you acting like this? You don't need your phone? JACKSON: Give me the phone, Samantha. Oh, the passcode is the same. This is more like it. (giggles) JACKSON: Stop. You've never stopped me before, Jay. Don't call me that. You need to leave. You are in a really bad mood. - What is wrong with you? - Get out! Have I done something? You need help. SAMANTHA: I did what you said. I gave it a break. I know where I went wrong, but I've changed. - Sam, stop! - Why? Because we are no longer together and you know why. I'm with Aubrey. She's expecting my child. Oh, Jackson. I hate people making a fool of you. That's not your child. I'm done. We can still work on us. I'm prepared to do that for you. JACKSON: No. No, Samantha. You're not listening. She's not right for you. She won't put you first like I did. She's an artist. What could you possibly have in common? This is ridiculous, you know that? Five years. Five years, Jay. Why would you throw it away after everything I did for you? After everything my family did for you. You just, you just don't know when to stop, do you? What about your mom? Don't care what she has to say? She wants us to have a family. Don't bring her into this. It's your mom who brought me out here. Nah, I don't believe that. It's true, Jay. She brought me out here to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life. If you leave, I'll talk. She only remembers speaking to you after the speeches. You offered her a job, the next thing she wakes up, and... Should we be worried? It doesn't look good. She believes her drink was spiked at your election party, attended only by your inner circle. We're not exposed otherwise, as far as I can tell. We had security. We shut the party down at the legal time. The photos on the internet were taken on her cell, so no evidence. All right. Good. The tests weren't able to confirm rape. Looks like sexual assault. Are they interviewing people? Yes. You'll have to answer questions. Is there anything else? As your attorney, I'll follow instructions. But off the record, this is only going to hurt you. The press, the costs. So what are you saying? Make it disappear. JACKSON: Bill, I didn't do anything. - It's how it looks. - I don't care how it looks. Do you want to fight it publicly? No. Think of Laura. She is humiliated by this. She wants this to go away. Do you really want to put her through the ordeal of trials and testimonies? How much are we talking? (knocking) Hi, Samantha. How are you? Well. Thanks. Hey, Sweetie. I was dropping by and thought I'd bring you lunch. JACKSON: So what about the photographs? They've been blocked by the social media companies. SAMANTHA: What's happening? What's going on? We'll discuss it later. (sobbing) (sighing) Hi, sweetheart, it's me. Mm-hmm. I ran into her in the lobby. Well, she was obviously upset. You know, she's a lot prettier than I thought she'd be. How are you? Aw, I'm so happy that you're getting along well. Aw, that's nice. When can I see you two? Well I have to meet somebody, but I could be there in about an hour. How's that? Yes, sure. I'll have them bring me my boat. Okay, wonderful. See you then. Bye. Still no sign? No. I need to know which room Rose Lewis is staying in please. I'm sorry, Ma'am. I can't share information about another guest. Do you have her contact details? No. No, I don't. Look... I know you know what room she's in. The father of my child is missing. Rose Lewis knows where he is. Are you telling me that you're not gonna help me? I'll tell you what. I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem here? The problem is I still can't find my boyfriend and she won't help me. Okay, so why don't we step into my office and let me see if I might be able to assist? Great. Rose Lewis knows where my boyfriend is. I simply want her room number so I can talk to her. Look, let me search the hotel for your boyfriend. Then I can speak to him and ask him to offer up his contact details. Hopefully, he can talk to you directly. So why don't you go, get some rest, and let me handle this for now. I can print off all the guests names, just between you and me. Hello, sweetheart. Hello. I love your blouse. I haven't seen this one before. Oh. Well, thank you. So, tell me everything. How is he? It's just all so perfect. He is so happy. Aw, well then I'm very happy too. So where is Jay? Why isn't he here with us? There is one person he did not want to see. You know, I don't think she ever thought that a baby wouldn't tie him down for good. So what's this woman's name again? It's Rose, Rose Lewis. Okay. Let's have a look through. Uh-uh. Okay. How about under Mason? Samantha Mason. Oh, room 526. A duplex suite, reserved for four nights. 5-2-6. GITA: There's another reservation under the same name in room 3317. Thank you, Gita. I've covered for you one too many times. You never needed to, and you certainly don't need to anymore. You don't need me to keep quiet? JACKSON: You... What I know could finish you. Finish your career. You could lose everything you've ever wanted. Then you can see how it feels. Really? You're gonna... Why would do you that to me? I'm doing it for us. I am warning you, Sam. Are you gonna hurt me like that other girl? JACKSON: You know I didn't do anything. I had your back and then you walked out on me. JACKSON: Why are you doing this to me? (thudding) Come on, Rose. Open up. I need to talk to you right now. How did you get my room number? Are you crazy? AUBREY: Jackson? He's not here. Jackson? ROSE: I'm calling security. Go right ahead. Yes, this is room 526. Someone has given out my room number without my authorization. I'd like to speak to a manager immediately please. Okay, thank you, ma'am. Samantha, please open this door. Excuse me, ma'am. Would you help me please? - Yes. - I went to get some ice for my swollen feet and stupidly locked myself out of my room. - The key's inside. - Reception can assist you. I really have to go. No one told me about this part of being pregnant. - You'll be fine. - Sorry, do you mind? Just this once. I really have to go. MAID: Okay. Thank you! Lucinda, has a pregnant woman come by here? Miss Ross, we're coming in. (gasping) Oh, my God. Oh, God. What have you done? SAMANTHA: I had your back and then you walked out on me. JACKSON: Why are you doing this to me? Then you should be out there looking for him. him, Why do you assume that he's in trouble? You saw the same blood I did. But you seemed sure that the blood belongs to him. It could be this girlfriend. Miss Mason. She's not his girlfriend. When did you last see Miss Mason? We had lunch earlier this afternoon. She and Jackson have just rekindled their relationship. ANDREWS: And how was your son? - He was fine. - You saw him? Sam did. How can you be sure that he's okay if you didn't see for yourself? Well, he hasn't disappeared, he just doesn't want Aubrey to find him. Why are you here on the island? Aubrey claims that she's carrying his child. It can get complicated. As you are the only one who has had any contact, I'm gonna need to hold on to your passport until we sort this matter out. Thank you. Mrs. Lewis? Mrs. Lewis. I know you think I'm wrong, but what if I'm not? If anything has happened to Jackson, how could you live with yourself? What kind of mother are you? One that wants the very best for her child. And that's not me? I know what kind of woman you are. Jackson may be impressed with it, but I certainly am not. You know what, Rose? You don't have to like me, but I am the mother of his child, and nothing can change that. Are you sure about that? Yes. Well, then you won't mind taking a paternity test. I don't know who is giving you these ideas about me. Miss Ross, Ms. Lewis, we've gone through the security footage from the hotel. You might want to take a look at this. That was just after he left the pool area, and this is later that same evening. AUBREY: Wait, rewind that. Right there, he looks like he's hurt. WILLIAMS: It does look that way. Where did they go? WILLIAMS: Cameras track them to a car in the parking lot. We lose them after that. Great. Am I free to go? I want you to call Samantha. How dare you. Call her. Now. Hello? Hi. Hi, is everything alright? I stopped by your hotel room. Well, I'm just a little worried. Oh. Okay. Oh, I thought so. Okay. Thank you. Bye. What'd she say? Well, it's just as I thought. Jackson took this little slip when he got out of the shower, but everything's okay. But where were they? Rose. Take me to him. Please. Come on. Jackson really likes this island. He was excited to share it with me. Well, you weren't the first. He brought Samantha here, right? No, I'd say that she brought him here. Her family has business interests here in Bermuda, so it's like a home away from home for those two. AUBREY: Great. It's closed. ROSE: You wanna look around? No, I don't honestly. I think it's a waste of time. I think it's better if we go back. Aren't you even a little worried about your son? From the moment your child takes its first breath you do nothing but worry. What if they don't learn how to walk or fail in school? What if they fall in with the wrong crowd? Only a mother knows the sacrifices she makes for her children. But you'll know one day, and then I hope that you won't think me so awful. You're fighting a losing battle. It isn't good for you or the baby. (elevator bell ringing) I can't seem to get my key to work. - Oh, the pain. - Yeah, I must have put it too close to my phone. It's room 3-3-1-7. Last name Mason. Thank you, Ms. Mason. I'm sorry you've been havin' trouble with that key. Thank you. Are you going to talk to me at some point? You know I had nothing to do with it right? SAMANTHA: How could you be so careless? How is this my fault? You invited a young girl onto the team. I told you it would only lead to trouble. Really, Sam? She wanted this to happen. You think she did this to herself? You think a member of the team did it? No, and I need to find a way to prove that. You're ruining everything for us. Make it go away. I can't. Even if I wanted to, I don't have the money that our lawyers are asking for. How much are we looking at? It's more than I have. Let my family help. No, I couldn't do that. They've done too much for me already. They would want to. They didn't support your campaign for you to just throw it away. And what about me? You want to humiliate me? I love you. I only want what's best for us. Do you know where this is? - The church? - Oh, you do?

ROSE: Where are you going? To find Jackson. Where are you going? Do you even know where he is? DRIVER: What the hell are you doing? You were right on my tail. You said we had to follow her because she was in labor. What? No, I'm not in labor. And no, I don't know where Jackson is, but I'm not leaving the island until I do. Look, I have no clue what's going on here. I don't want no part of this. Wait. Wait, you can't just leave me here. Stop! If it makes you feel any better, why don't I help you look for him? I know this island much better than you do. Fine, but hurry up. ROSE: I'm afraid it will only confirm what you already know. I only wanna know the truth. Well, the truth may not be what you want to hear. (clock ticking) SAMANTHA: Good morning, sweetheart. Jackson. The... the details of Laura's settlement can't be made public, right? ATTORNEY: It's a sealed case. All right. So, what exactly am I looking at here? The worst possible scenario. Laura's tox report shows the presence of alcohol and your prescription drugs. It's a good thing you took my advice. Sam. No, no, no, no, no. You need to rest. ♪ Did you hold me close ♪ Just relax. I've got everything under control. Do you remember that trip we took to Rome four years ago? Wasn't it a dream? God, if someone had told us everything we would have to go through. But nothing worth having comes easy. Well this was their favorite place, and they're not here, so I guess they don't want to be found. I don't really care what they want. Are you sure you want to go on with this? It's only gonna cause you more pain. Ever since I met Jackson, we've been together every single day. He even took me to Hong Kong with him for his birthday last year. I love him. And he loves me. So yeah, I wanna keep going. The water. (grunting) Hello. He is so happy. Aw. Well, then I am very happy too. We've been talking, houses, and even dates. That's wonderful. Timing wise, we want to start a family before we get into campaigning from state legislature to US Senate. Well, he will make a fine US Senator one day. And then working out how we celebrate his birthday in the middle of this campaign, there's just so much to plan. So where is Jay? Why isn't he here with us? - SAMANTHA: Hiding. - ROSE: Oh. There is one person he did not want to see. (laughing) His mother? Hardly! Thank you. So when will it be safe? How about tonight? We could go for dinner at the lighthouse. We've still got a lot of catching up to do. LAURA: I can't believe it. He offered me the job. PR manager for two years. I mean, I knew he was appreciating my work, but I didn't want to assume. Well, congratulations. Cheers. Are you okay? LAURA: I don't know. You can't drive home like this. Shall we call you a cab? (panting) There's only room for one woman in his life. JACKSON: Laura. Laura? (camera shutter clicking) Medication. Come on! That girl cannot take no for an answer. It is pathetic how desperate she is. I don't know what you saw in her. Right, enjoy your stay. MANT: Thank you. AUBREY: Hi. Have you seen these two people? I'm sorry but I can't help you. The police already made a call, and I let them know there's no one staying here fitting that description. Okay, I just need a minute. Thank you. (sighs) Are you giving up? Well the police have already called all the resorts, and we're not getting anywhere. Yeah, you should just go. Really, I just want to be alone. No, we're going to stay together. In case they call. Have you eaten anything today? No, I really don't feel like food. Well it's not just for you, it's for the baby. The thought of food just makes me so nauseous. ROSE: All food? No, not all food. I mean the only thing I can think about eating is sauerkraut. (laughing) Oh. I'm sorry. When I was pregnant, all I could think about eating with sauerkraut. (laughs) JACKSON: How was the beach? It was good. I had a nice swim. I know I've been difficult. You have been in the worst situation. You shouldn't have stepped out on me. But that's why you need me. I can help you change. Can I get you anything else? What more could a man want? No, no. Sam, come on. We really don't have to do this. SAMANTHA: Don't be shy. I don't want you to think I'm just using you. SAMANTHA: I won't. - I want to. - Come on, no. Seriously let's just sit. Let's relax. Let's not do this. Come on, really, let's... What's this? You weren't going to... You don't wanna get married. You do not want to get married. You don't have to do this. It's not your duty. Samantha, you're right. I don't have to. So you won't? Good. (sighs) Good. You know this ring would never do for me. I've always wanted one with two little pink stones either side. Be so cute. You know what would be brilliant? We should announce our engagement at the next election. Can you imagine? Your mom's face would be brilliant. Just think of the publicity. All we need is a miscarriage and it'll be perfect. That's enough! There's only one girl I would every really marry, and that's Aubrey. What? JACKSON: The ring is for her. What did you say? No. Fine. You stay with that cheap slut. Don't forget what I know! What's that? SAMANTHA: It's your drugs in that girl's drink. Samantha, go and say whatever lies you want about me. Ruin my career if it makes you feel any better, but we are never going to be together. What you did to that girl is unforgivable. I had nothing to do with it. Yeah, yeah sure you didn't. Who do you think the press will believe? And what great timing. Yeah, why's that? You have a choice. Aubrey or your career? The answer is right in here. You think you can do better than me. (screams) She won't love you half as much as I did. She won't put you first like I did. She won't forgive your indiscretions. JACKSON: I wouldn't want her to. SAMANTHA: We could have been so happy if you'd just given us a real chance. No. (screaming) Sam, what are you doing? - Stop it! - Help, he's trying to kill me! (screaming) (siren wailing) Thank you for getting here so fast. We have the male guest in a separate room, but the young lady's in my office and she's really upset. (sobbing) Let her tell you her story. We were at the bar last night and he was drinking a lot. More than usual. There was this guy who was checking me out, and this morning I said I was flattered. Why did I say that? I shouldn't have said it but I did. And he got so mad and it's all my fault. Am I in trouble? There's never a good reason to put hands on a woman. But I don't want to press charges, he's been doing so much better recently. Has he done this before? We need to take you to see a doctor. And then we'll put him in lock up until he dries out. You need to think carefully about whether you're going to let him off the hook again. What happened, Mr. Mason? Who is Mr. Mason? My name is Jackson Lewis. Listen she is making this whole thing up. Those injuries she has, she did that to herself. Yeah, right. Listen, call my mom, all right? Her cell is in my phone. She'll fix this. All right. (cell door squealing) Sweetheart, where are you? No, Aubrey is here right next to me. Is that Jackson? I can arrange that, yeah. Okay, I'll see you then. Driver, where are we? We're just coming up to the post office. Would you turn around? I want to go to Palmetto Wharf as soon as possible please. Rose, please just tell me what's going on. Was that Jackson? Is he okay? He's fine. I'm taking you to see him right now. Okay? - Come on board. - AUBREY: Is this your boat? Oh, we're members of a private club so we use it when we're here. Can you just tell me what Jackson said? We're going to see him, and he can explain everything. Come on! Jackson never mentioned anything about having a boat here. I know you can hear me out there! Shouldn't be in here, she's crazy! Made the whole thing up! Anybody hear me? I need to make a phone call! I know my rights! AUBREY: I've never been too good on water. Oh, I love it. Oh, there's some water underneath here in the fridge, if you want some. Thanks. - Mom! - Oh, my god. Darling, it's a urinal. What's going on? What happened? Mom, get me out of here. Can you give us a moment in private please? Thank you. What have you done? I sorted out your bail. I'm here now. Everything is gonna be all right, Jackson. I'll never forgive you for this. My flight was delayed. I got here as soon as I could. What more do you want me to do? Why would you bring Samantha here? Samantha? You gave me the letter with the room key. - What? - Mom, where's Aubrey? Aubrey? How should I know where Aubrey is? You're not making any sense. You know you're not supposed to drink with your medication. You know that. Would you kindly sign off on this bail bond please, Mrs. Lewis? I'm gonna need to see some passports. Here. Aren't we heading away from the main island? Yeah, that's what you do when you go by boat. AUBREY: I'm not feeling so well. I think we should go back. Sea sick? I would just feel a lot better on land. Aw, being sea sick is awful. Listen, why don't you come up here and sit down in the front and keep your eyes off into the horizon. It's okay. It was just a boat's wake. No, I think we should go back right now. I wanna go back. No, we're almost there. - Aubrey, wait. - No. You stay away from me. I know who you are. ROSE: Stop! Please. Aubrey. Aubrey, stop. Wait! Help! Somebody! Help me! (gasps) ROSE: Samantha! She ruined everything. Oh my God, let go of her! (shouting) (tires squealing) (thudding) (groaning) Help. Somebody please help me. (sirens wailing) (machine beeping) Aubrey, I'm here. I'm here. Jackson. No, no, no, don't. You need to rest. You need to rest, all right? They had to perform an emergency caesarean, okay. So our son is premature, so he's in the NICU right now. All right? The doctor says he's going to be fine. A son? Can I see him? Yes, yes, in a minute. What happened? I never left you. Sam. It's all over now. And Rose? Ms. Mason? She's been questioned by the police. She had no idea. Sweetie, I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. I let you down. Can I come in? Mom, now's not really a good time. How are you feeling? Aubrey, meet my mom. Mom? I never thought I would meet the mother of my first grandchild like this. I'm going to let the two of you have some time alone. You're not going to have any privacy for the next 18 years or so, you better make the most of it. Right. JACKSON: Mom. Wait. Whoa. What is that? JACKSON: It's a car seat. No, no, no, no. Will you marry me? Jackson. Yes. Oh, Jackson. Congratulations. Congratulations. Wait, I told my parents that you had left me. I don't think they'll be very happy about this. Well, on the contrary, your dad and I get along quite well. He gave me his blessing. He did? I think they're here now. Mom! We were so worried. You see I... I had this plan to bring us all together in Bermuda. Of course, if I had known you would have said yes in a hospital bed, I could have saved a ton of money. Are you ready to see your baby boy? Yeah. I am. Hey. Shhh.
