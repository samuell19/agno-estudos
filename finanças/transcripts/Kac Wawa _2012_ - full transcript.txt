Girl, if you are 20, then I am Pankracy and I'm working in the mine. Do you take the girls or not? No, we are leaving. You are too young. Yeah. You will see a true demon of sex.

Anything? Listen, I'm looking for one good-looking blonde. Go to the escort agency. Problem is, that she is my fiancée. You have a girlfriend in a brothel? So how it's going to be, Cucumb? -And who are you? -Your E-coli bacteria. What bacteria? Shit! I saw Sandra punch her in the face. Kobyla dragged her completely drunk from the club. The receptionist knows more. You were supposed to uphold high moral standards and you deceived me. -They will kill me. -Nice glasses. May I? Listen, I'm not a sadist. I just wanted to show you how a bicycle with one gear works. What if I light all of them? Ask! Tour de France… or the Peace Race? What's the difference? Weren't you interested in fucking cycling? Tour de France means 250 km hard riding uphill for many hours. And the Peace Race is all about friendship between nations. It's medals. It's Russian champagne and maybe even a modest cash prize. I choose the Peace Race. I saw her leaving the club with Kobyla. What Kobyla? -He supposedly works with Kaban. -Who's Kaban? -He works with Kobyla. -What the fuck? Kaban reportedly runs an escort agency, but I don't know where. I swear I don't know. I had to serve the customer and didn't pay attention. And your fiancée… What? …was pretty drunk. Sorry for calling so late, but I wouldn't wake you up without a reason. Kaban and some Kobyla. Does it ring any bells? Let's meet at the parking lot under the Victoria. See you.

Five hundred. How much? Six hundred. Six hundred? It was five hundred a moment ago. Have you heard about inflation? What about half an hour? Five hundred. Just a moment. So I would like a lady for 14 and a half minutes. How long? I have 143 złotych, which gives… fourteen minutes and seventeen seconds. Pitagoras. It's not a tanning salon by the minute. If you have 600 you enter. If not, then fuck off. So I'm… fucking off. -What was that? -I hate to break it to you. CROOKNOSE FORMER SB OFFICER Kaban was suspected of human trafficking and blackmail. Unfortunately we didn't have hard evidence. But together with Kobyla they were active in clubs. A pill into a drink, the girls would disappear, end up in German whorehouse… but they got away with it. It was Sandra who helped them. She's their whore. Yuck! Disgusting. Can you get me a piece? I can get you anything you want. Let's meet here in an hour. In an hour. 11 HOURS TILL WEDDING Here. And how were our men enjoying themselves? How were they enjoying themselves? Thank you. First they invited girls to the room, but apparently they didn't like them so they went down to the club. I'm listening. In the club they also weren't too successful, apart from your husband. Go on. I had very hard day and I'm not sure I saw everything well. Your husband met two nice ladies and they drove somewhere together. But I don't know where. Hello? Yes, darling? I'm happy that you are having fun. I'm going to bed. I'm a good boy. Of course, I love you. Mr. President… Who's that? The receptionist brought the bill for pressing the suits. The receptionist? Bye. Nine thousand? Yes, 9,000. You had fun, time to pay. -Why so much? I didn't do anything. -Two nice ladies for the whole night… the bed all fucked up and three champagnes on top of that. What champagnes? Just Russian bubbles. Sorry my friend, but we charge restaurant rates. In the supermarket such "champagnes" are for 4.50. So you should have gone to the supermarket. -But-- -Let's end this bullshit. You have a gold card. Pay up and leave. You must understand. I have an ATM limit of 1,000 złotych a day. My wife set it up. So you will have to stay with us for nine days. When we get from your account what is due, you can go to your shithole. Give me the card and the PIN. -How do you suppose… It's impossible-- -Shut up! -Give me the card before I get mad. -Okay. Stop shouting. I will keep cards… clothes and the cellphone as collateral. -And what am I supposed to do here? -What "what"? Water is backing up in the toilet. Grab the tools and show me what you can do. Yes. You will lend me your tie. Fuck no. With your face a chain suits you better than a tie. Hey, Kobyla, calm down. We have a handyman with a handy gold card. It's his PIN. He claims he has a 1,000 złotych limit. Check it out. Who's there? Kobyla. What? Zenon. Neighbor. You know what time it is? Yes. I was just passing by, saw the light and I thought I can knock. I work upstairs. The agency on the third, I know. It's just a cover. I work in vice. I think I saw you before. Yes. You kicked my dog last week. Would I be able to kick anyone? Fucking dog! I almost had her. I have a bombshell for you. -Tell me. -I'm sending you a CCTV video. Okay, send it. Look carefully. This is this Sandra I told you about. Sandra. -What? -Are you Sandra? -What do you want from me? -Get out! Where is my future wife? Let me go! Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Drop the gun! Police! Down! Sandra! Listen, Kobyla. Some shithead with a gun was chasing me. Come to the agency. Where have you been? I'm telling you he chased me. But he didn't catch you. Sure, I'm coming. He doesn't get it. Okay, where is the taxi? She is not normal. 9 HOURS TILL WEDDING POLICE Andrzej… take care. Okay. ATM What a stupid PIN. Okay and once again. Fuck. Freeze! Police! Ah, an old friend. Let's go. Let's go, Kobyla. How much a kilometer? Make yourselves at home. Kaban, we have nice guests. Hide it somewhere. -Good evening to the law enforcement. -Good evening. -Aspirant Mizera. -How can I help? Your friend Kobyla had a fight with an ATM. The ATM won. Citizen Kobyla got mad that the ATM paid out only 1,000 złotych. I told you that there is a limit on the card, moron. But this is a gold card. Kobyla, you look like an owner of a gold chain, but not a gold card. Whose card is this? Our plumber. Kobyla! Mr. Jerzy, please come here. Is this your card? I guess so. -Name? -Jerzy. I mean, Słomka Jerzy That's right. Why did you give your card to citizen Kobyla? I work a lot so I asked my friend to withdraw some money from the ATM. Jurek. My friend from the military. ID! I got it. You always work wearing only in briefs? You know, I often work on my knees so I just took of my pants… …so that the pants knees don't bag. Yes, so they don't bag. Jerzy Słomka. That's right. Thank you. Oh, Kaban. And how is morality in the neighborhood? Again we heard that no students live here, just whores and prostitutes. Only students, officer. Your colleague saw it himself when he was here last week. Last week was last week. How do we know who is here today? -Only students. -Only students. This lady too? Sure. She does evening studies. Veterinary, I guess. What veterinary? Shagging, boning, doggie-style and pussy cleaning. Interesting studies. Kaban. If we finding anything wrong, you know what the consequences of pimping are? What pimping? Officer, I loathe prostitution. -Sandra! -Yes… uncle? I mean, professor. Take the education officers to the room and show them your grade book. With pleasure. -Gocha! -Yes? Help your friend with classes. -One day I will fucking kill Sandra. -Me too. Move it! And you? Fuck off to study. Klaudia! Didn't you hear? Get to it! What a night. Full moon. Or sunspots. And where is fucking Jerzy Słomka? I have to admit that the students are very diligent. They failed the exams. B+. Didn't I tell you? The best students. Hope not see you soon, Kaban. But if we hear that something is wrong, we will come with another inspection. Hear, hear. Better clean your ears. Dogs in heat! It's you, again? Give me a chance, please. Please go away or I will call the police. I wanted to apologize to the dog. How? I know how to bark. Okay, apology accepted. Didn't work. She just doesn't care. Hi, I am Grzegorz. I am a businessman.

Level: hard, hard, very hard. Sure. Hit me. Okay. Number one. Ronaldinho's shoe depth. What? What depth? Are you kidding? Simple. Any shoemaker apprentice in Rio would answer that. Is Michael Jackson dead? Or maybe Elvis Presley? Actually, I don't know this. You don't know that? It means, you know very little. Okay. Your last chance. The third. Listen… How many bahts to the franc? -Bahts? -Bahts. -What bahts? -Thai bahts, bonehead. Don't know, don't know, don't know. Try Wikipedia, not a chat. Are you answering or fucking off? Fucking off.

You want to hit on her with dog food? 8 HOURS TILL WEDDING Yes, I remember I have to get your stockings mended tomorrow. Gentlemen, please feel at home. -No way. It's so cool! -Am I dreaming, man? Where is your fiancé? Just a minute. Our friend was here. A blond guy. Gray-haired in red shirt. Where is he? Ran to his wife. So he fucked. Man, it seems we are the only ones to get some meow, because every hussy has a pussy. Are you waiting or not? My dick doesn't like to pay. Will you look after them for me for a while? Sandra! Sir, yes, sir! Stop that. Sorry, yes, sir! I don't want the client to hump. Yeah, cool. Gocha! Yes, darling? Do you still have this super laxative? Great, forgot to leave money. Where are you going? Almost got hit! Man, are you blind? You almost ran over the dog. What dog? You dickhead! Thank you very much. You are a dear. Come on. Are you all right? Yea. Cold evening. You also came to this agency? Me? No. I just escorted some friends. It's not really my thing. Thanks, anyway. The collar! Here you are. I have a job for you.

Come to me. Sit this shapely ass on your teddy bear. Oh yes! Yes! What's wrong, sweetie? Darling, I forgot to take a pee. Must have slipped my mind. I'll be right back. -What's up? -Where is the toilet? -Here. Where are you going? -But I have to! -Pee? -No. Poo. -Fifty złotych. -What? Is it paid? -Paid, 50 złotych or get lost. -Man, 50? Normally it's 20, but we charge night rate now. Okay. Lie down! You bad dog. Nice flat. It's my boyfriend's. Where is he? Pardon? Where is he? In Silesia. No shit. I am here and he is there. So, you didn't like it in the agency? You know, it's not my thing. I don't like to have sex against the clock. So why do men do it? What do you mean? -There you go. -Thank you. Go away! You still didn't get her? She doesn't want to get laid. Forget her. And where will I find another so inaccessible? Good wife material. And now you want to snatch her with flowers? If it doesn't work, I have this. -You got it from Cucumb? -Yep. You are fucking nuts. Cucumb, I hope it's mild stuff. It's for a real lady. It's inappropriate. We don't really know each other. Yeah, we meet five times and then it will be appropriate. What will I learn in that time? The name of your mutt? What is your mother's name and what you got in geography in the sixth grade? Either there is chemistry or not. Do you remember how it was after your prom? I remember, but now it was much better. -One more time? -The hard way? 7 HOURS TILL WEDDING Kitty… Kitty?

No slapping, kissing and hugging. -So what am I paying for? -For sex. For sex? Non-contact sex, it seems. Where have you been so long, honey? You know, after peeing I always thoroughly wash my warrior. I have to drink something. I'm parched again. All right. Now undress your commando. Look how eager my willy is. -I see. You are so macho. -Oh yes. Did I pinch your willy? No, darling. I seem to have a bladder infection. Be right back. He is not here! What's up, champ? Poo again! Fifty złotych. No one will slap me on the ass. A princess, for fuck's sake! If I was looking for a princess I would be visiting palaces and not brothels. -If you don't like it, get the fuck out! -I have already paid. Maybe at least a dance? Okay. Your man came back from Silesia? -No, it's probably my retarded admirer. -Should I stop? Don't worry. He will wait a while and go away. Continue. Go away! Do you like it? Go away! Get the fuck out!

And legs wide. -Show me what you got there. -Take it into your mouth. Blowjob costs 200 extra. -Extra? I have already paid for one hour. -Yes, but for sex. And blowjob is not sex? A blowjob is oral sex and you paid for regular sex. Okay… Cool. -Here is 180 and start blowing. -Pardon? You think you can throw me some money and order me around like some cheap whore? Okay, I'm sorry! Listen, let's make love, okay? I make love to my boyfriend. Okay. Don't pout and turn round. It hurts from behind. All right. So how do you want it? Cowgirl? You know, when I was little I fell off the horse and… Okay, so lets do this the classic way. Hey. Time's up. No more humping. -What banging? There wasn't any humping. -Sorry. Not my fault. Piss off! Piss off? Friend, piss off yourself. Fuck. She is totally fucked-up. -Hey, spitfire. Want one in the face? -Fuck off! Not the ear! Let go of my ear! Give me back the gun. -I don't have it. -Give it back! -My jacket-- -Get out! I got this jacket from my mom. I'll be right back. Now, you will be mine. Time's up. What are you doing here? -Get lost! -What do you mean, "get lost"? Time's up. Next time take a pee at home when you feel romantic. And I wanted you so much. -Time has flown by so fast? -Flown, indeed. Get out! Get out. Maybe next time, okay? Bye. And? You overdid a bit with this laxative. -I poured too much. -He almost blew up the loo. Man, you got a gum? -Do you have this stuff? -Yes. Sweets. Refreshing. Give me one. Yo, maniac. How was it? T'was good. 5 HOURS TILL WEDDING Morning. It was the shortest night in my life. How can I help you? Let me guess. You are Kobyla. You are Kaban. Missed, you cockeyed twat. Your luck, jackass or it'd be your funeral and not wedding. Be nice, Sandra! -So this is Miss Sandra. -So what? -Give me the gun! -It's mine. Give me the gun, sit your ass here and listen! -Sandra! -All right. And now I ask for the last time. What happened to my friends? The idiots took some boosters. They took them by themselves? You run a supermarket? When will they come round? I don't know. So we have a problem. -What fucking-- -What? I'm sorry. What problem? Problem, that miss Sandra will have to give first aid to my friends. Sandra, this gentleman asks. Yes, pretty please. Okay. I was bored anyway. And here we go. It's not so hard, is it. Well. And now, unfortunately, I have to shoot you. Don't kill me, please. Please? And what happened to "faggot" and "fucking philosopher"? I beg you, please. Suddenly, you're well-mannered. Okay. Fine. -Undress! -What? I beg your pardon? Move, and take off your pants. You work in show business, right? In the porn business? So you will start with acting. Listen… Excuse me… We can work this out. I told you to take off your pants. Move it! Now, an empathy lesson. Yes… hug him. Give him a nice hug. Give it to him. Don't be afraid. You will like it. It's nice. Hug him. Give him a big hug. Oh yes… That's the way… Nice… Hug him. And now, you kneel, you pull out your dick and you suck your friend. Grab your friend's schlong or I will shoot straight through your elbow. You are dead. Giddy up, Kobyla! Giddy up. Hiya! Good. Doing well. It's going to be a cool movie on YouPorn! Oh crap. You can't even do a proper blowjob. -You lost my respect. -Shut up! You are doing well. So, who's the faggot now? Say it. No. Here, to the camera. I am a faggot. "I am a faggot." Fuck, those whores are ugly. You fucking nut. I will fucking kill you! He tripped over his skivvies. And look here. Somehow, I am not fucking killed. I am not fucking killed. Okay. So whom will I shoot first? I beg you. Don't. You are having some mood swings. "I will fucking kill you." "I beg you." You have to choose. Guys, cheer up. You got some talent. Really. It's going to a blockbuster. It will be a hit. Let's go. Goodbye, guys… I mean, ladies. Kobyla… Fuck… don't even think about it. Just… an idea. Fuck this business. Halo, you still got this last minute? Yes. I quit this job. But I want samba courses there. Where have you been? We are getting married in an hour. I was looking for you. Where? Everywhere. All over Warsaw. Even in the brothel. I have the worst hangover in my life. Me too. Do you want to call off the wedding? No. You? No. It was the strangest night in my life, but… I learned one thing. What thing? That I love you more than anything. -Hurry up. The next one will be ours. -I'm changing. Now you are really fucked up. You think that no one will recognize you? Your ticket. The phone. No. Don't answer it. How can this country work when those cretins do nothing but watch some stupid online videos. Honduras? They were on sale. -Where the fuck is it? -Up your ass! Faggots, get in! Honduras. Romantic. Hey… Wait for me. Wait! Subtitle translation by: Jacek Mackiewicz
