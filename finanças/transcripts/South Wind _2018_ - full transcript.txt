Bartender, be my friend tonight. I won't drink all night. What? You want to steal cars but you are afraid of driving fast? I'm not afraid of speed. I am afraid of you. You will answer me for this! Do you want coffee? -No Call the Tsar, tell him that is done. Marash, I'm sorry, I didn’t know. I swear by my mom! You would know if you checked the car but you immediately ran to the Tsar to get into his ass without soap with his tip. Not true! Marash, don't tell Tsar. This won't happen again! Hello, don’t stand like a pillar, Help me remove this garbage! Leave me alone! Snot! Tell Paya to make coffee I’ll fall asleep now. I have a rendezvous. -Here you go, it will wake you up. What a companion! Have you taken your cellphone? I've taken everything. Do you know where to go? Yes, I know, I know. Documents... And without stupid things. Go to the Golub. Clear. You would like the village put on rubber boots. And here it isn't necessary. I can’t hear anything. I’ll call when they finish. Kisses. Bye! Damn, you scared me! Damn, sorry This is too high. It should be 10 cm lower. Right here. Don't want too low No, this is a standard height. What do you say? Who is interested in my opinion? What are your girlfriends from Instagram saying? What do they know, idiots? Now everyone thinks to know the best. Let's not bother him. -I want everything to be as it should. Do we bother you? -Let the hostess decide. Precisely, we bother you. Leave me alone! Where were you last night? What do you think? -Tell me honestly, where? Engaged in theft? -No, I worked. Worked with a slut? She is not a slut. -Yeah? She is a sophisticated lady. From Ukraine. She doesn't know the language. But knows everything else. Wait, that man is still there. Truth? -Yes! I’ll go to my parents to pick up some things, and I will be back. Has he finished already? Well, are you satisfied? Is everything the way you wanted? As if you are interested. Well, what's wrong again? Come on, go. What do you have, PMS? For the last month, I don’t understand you at all what's going on with you. I can’t deal with this crap right now. To you, everything comes down to crap or fucking. It’s impossible to talk seriously with you. -About what? Now about nothing. You aren't normal. I don’t understand you at all. One minute everything is alright, the next minute nothing is ok. Everything is fine when I give money for a new apartment, car, shopping. And the rest of the garbage! Whined constantly about the family nest Oh please! but again you are unhappy with something -Sure. Because you act like a child who doesn't know what he wants. And you, like, know. At 25, you enrolled in college, for which I pay. I want to change something in my life! I don't want to be just your next slut! And I don't care about your money! I'll manage on my own. And I can manage without you. I thought something would change when we move in here, but... I can’t do like this anymore, really. You are never here. Either you'll change something, or live as before but without me. Where are you going? -To the gym. Do not mumble. Chew and answer clearly. To the gym. Homework done? When I get back, I’ll do it. You'll deal with the homework first and then you go. No training until you do your homework! Don't fuck my brains. I have a match at the end of the week. What did you say? What did you say? Come here. Take these buckets down. Here's your training. Take both and move! I broke down bigger horses in the military than you, as if I won't break one chicken. In the army, you only broke bottles instead of soldiers. Peter says you are drunk fired from the army. Come on, listen more to your brother! You'll become trash like him. Get lost home to do your homework! Don't stand like a pillar! Come back! I'll write you out of this fucking boxing section, you bastard! Where are you rushing? I'm late for training. See you when I get back. No, no way. I just need to pick up something and leave immediately. Have you moved in? Let me know when I can come and see the apartment. Why didn't you offer yourself like that when we had to move the furniture? I have a fight at the end of the week I have to take care of myself. Come and take a look. -Good Fuck... Eat with bread, or else your stomach will hurt. Take another loaf of bread. Mom, I don’t need so much bread. Eat, eat. How is Lazar? Still... Drinking? Sure. That is what he does best. And his apiary, all the same he can't sell the honey. He's only wasting time. -Okay, it's better for him to have something to do. I don't know. I’ll tell you one thing, he doesn’t leave this child alone. Everything annoys him, and his friends, and parties and boxing... Although I am also against his boxing activities. Don't worry. It is better when the child fights in the gym, and not on the street. What worries me isn't that he fights, he gets beaten there. Mom, your stuffed cabbage is just a miracle. I'll pack it for you to bring. That's you. I heard a noise. I decided to check if a thief got into our house. And I've really found a thief. Where are my cars? I threw them away. Do you want me to throw you out the window? I wanted to throw them away but she didn’t let me. Here they are, in a box. Mommy packed for you. Don't forget stuffed cabbage. That's what I definitely won't forget. You’re leaving already, and we haven't spoken normally. Neither about Sophia nor the apartment, nothing. Make him some coffee. -Don't! What happened? What did you say to him? I have nothing to talk with him -Stop it already! Do you want Nenad to be on the street because of you too? I’ll stop if he stops appearing here. I would have ended this a long time ago if not for his mommy! He won’t buy me for 500 euros. What have you said? -What you heard. What have you said? -What you heard. I would be ashamed. Idiot. Maybe we should take this? A child doesn’t like fruit cakes, take him fucking chocolate. May I recommend Dolce Latte? No, this is for faggots. Take two chocolate cakes, stop philosophizing! Hey Golub. What is it? He still hasn't arrived. Who, Christo? -They have been waiting in the apartment for three hours. So call him. I called, he doesn't pick up the phone. And what have we decided? We have decided that you suck dick. Calm down animal. Don't do that here. - Shut up! I've been dreaming about these boobs all month. Hi Cappuccino. -Hi kid. How are you? Nothing, okay. How many horses? 600 in total. What are you doing? Tsar said to disassemble for parts. The owner said that he doesn't have money to buy it. Moron. He had 100,000 to buy it. and now 10,000 is too much for him. - He probably took it on credit. Now it’s easier to find out who has money at the bank, then at the police. Godfather, I don't know why they choose me. Probably because I'm from this area, where everyone knows that I'm an honorable and honest man. I don't know, they want me to be a mediator. Listen to my advice. Go to the bank and take the money off the account. Pay them and escape to Slovenia. No cops, no testimony. Most importantly, your wife and children are safe. You're a computer genius, you'll make that money in two-three months. Peaceful sleep has no price. Bravo, man! Call back as soon as you cross the border So that your godfather doesn't worry. - Are you his godfather? Technically, yes. -What does that mean? He chose me as a witness for the wedding. He is imposed, so why don't we knock him. Someday he will do the same to us. -It will not work! What have you said? You? Marash? How can you say that? Call him from this number. Get over with it. How can you think something like that? It's all right, Yani. You broke my heart. - Come on, Yani. I know everything. These are my problems. Wrap this for me, please. My fingers are too thick. Your problems? -That's right. I know what he went through when his father died on the front, and his mother became ill. You know me, I've never been a wimp, I don't leave friends in trouble. I take the risk. He will work for us as much as he can. You don't have to work with him. Do you agree? -If you say so... That's it. And as long as it's your problem. Right. Let's have a drink. My daughter-in-law is in the hospital. Just about to give birth. I will become a grandfather. Can you imagine? Me, grandfather. I will have a grandson! For his health! For his health! Dragoslav! What? Peter! At least once to visit us! Have we offended you? -No way. Your husband makes us work a lot to make money for him. He must honor us. Of course, grandchildren aren't born every day. That's why I came. Stevan has called we have to go to the hospital. O fuck! Started? Yes, it has begun. And you smoke that shit! So what? Will you forbid me, or what? I don't want to have cataract like your dad! This is medicine, I've already shown you American studies. There is nothing worse than losing your mind in old age. Let's go already! And you come to us sometimes. Say hello to your mom! Dragoslav, let's go! Congratulations! Fuck you! I am not going to make excuses for you. I will smoke. I don't give a shit. When we were young, we beat those who smoke weed. We called them junkies. I didn’t understand then what a good thing this is. I have to go. Where are my keys? Here they are, grandpa stoned. -This is good shit. Let's finish this thing. Watch out for these two so they can't do something stupid. And don't stand out. Take the money, leave the car and go. Clear? -If you say so... Marash... Hard times are coming. Let's not fight. We aren't just friends. We are a family. And family is the most important thing in life. Come on... Go, grandfather. Your wife is waiting for you. -Fuck you! Give me the money. -Where is my car? Give me the money I said! Everything is here, six thousand, as my godfather said. The car is in the parking lot behind the supermarket. Keys are on the front right wheel. Stop here. I need to buy something for Sophia. What condoms do you like? Strawberry, watermelon? I don’t know, maybe southern fruits? For example, a banana? My little monkey. What do you think will happen? My monkey? Why are you torturing me? Why do you need a condom? Do you not trust me? What is he doing? What? What does he want? He wants to steal their car. Fuck. You don't trust me, huh? Hurry. I only have half an hour free. Choose already. -One chocolate bar. Then you will see how I'll finish you. Keep the change. Ok, take the orange Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, bitch! Dragoslav ... We have problems? On the contrary, we won the lottery. What lottery? Mercedes, a real hunk. We’re gonna get a lot of money. What Mercedes? What are you talking about? 387 horses. S 500. He just stood waiting for me. Bulgarian tags, just arrived. Now tell me, "Thank you!" Marash ... stop, park and get out of there. Are you kidding me? You hear me. Park and get out! Listen, we’ll get at least ten for him. Don’t fuck my brains. I don’t want to hear anything about any Mercedes! I became a father! -Son! Listen! Dragoslav! I became a dad! You’ll change your mind when you see him! So, we have one wolf and three little pigs! Who wants to be a wolf? -I! Wow, so many wolves we have... And the piglets? Well stop it, we need three little pigs. Can't we find a single one? Son, take care of the throne. Dad is coming back soon. Christo, my Christo... I try to treat you well. You always make some shit. Golub, you're wrong. I never lied to you. I’m trying to reach you all day, but you don't give a shit. I was driving, I haven't heard, I swear! Where is the car? Stolen. I don't know who did it. Stolen? Yes. Trust me! Okay, if they're just stolen. I was thinking about something worse. Maybe you decided to steal from Uncle Golub? I swear by my children! I just stopped for a minute to buy cigarettes. I swear! Trust me! I believe you. -I believe it. I swear to you, that you will sit in this basement until the car appears. Wait, Golub! Wait! My dad will kill you! What have you said? Bastard! Your father's time is long gone! Fucking bastard! Should we cut him? No, I need him in one piece. The report is incomplete. It's chaotic. I don’t even know where to start. I’m not sure that you understand what I need. I need a full report on the work of your department over the past year. Can I get it? -No. Why not? No one has written it. Wait a minute. You must write it! Do I look like a writer? But I... I'm listening. Which car? I get it. Okay, I'll call you back. Wait for me downstairs in the car. Wait, but the boss told me... Tell the boss that he can kiss my ass. But I have to provide a report for the foreign delegation! I need a department report against drugs! Here's the office, here's paper! Do whatever you want! It doesn’t bother me! Come on, Raiko! Beautiful T-shirt! Where did you get it? In Milano, in a boutique. It's beautiful. Donatella? No, Gianni. - Oh, Gianni! Old school. Cool thing. Where did you get this? From Afghanistan. Don't fuck. From who do you get it? You know that very well. Yes or no? How much is there? 50 grams. This is 800 euros. All right, we'll be here on Friday, and take another 50. If this goes well. You will take 100, when you see what you bought. Dilute at least three times. See you, handsome. -Three times at least, I don't want overdoses. Sorry, work. -Nothing. You will redeem yourself tomorrow, when you take me shopping. Shopping again? I just bought you shoes for 500 euros yesterday. I need a suitable coat for them. Go dance a little. What? -Go dance and get lost. I need to talk with business partners. How are you, Yani? -Hello. Well, let's see. Your eyes sparkle. Have you taken the drug? I do not take drugs for years. After the death of my father, sometimes, a little. A little bit? -Well, yes What are you doing here? We have heard that the music here is cool. Yes, not bad. Are you really an idiot, or what? I need you. We have problems in your field. What problems? -International. One Bulgarian gentleman has came to Belgrade to have some fun. He wanted to see the city, but everything went to hell. After 2 hours, they stole his car. Black Mercedes. I don’t know anything about it. Yani, it's me, uncle Stupar. Don't pretend to be a fool. But I really don’t know anything. Black Mercedes, you say? I have nothing to do with it. It's really loud here. Let's go out so that we could talk normally. I'm coming. -Come on! Enough, Raiko, don’t! Put your hands down! I've said, put the fucking hands down! Put your hands down, you motherfucker! -Stupar, I don’t know anything, I swear! If I knew, I would already say! -Enough, Raiko. Enough already, Raiko. Stop. Fuck you! Listen, don't make yourself a hero. You have always been a wimp. Or will you tell me everything right away, or Raiko will work with you a little more, and then you’ll tell me everything. Come on. Are you okay? -Yes. Would you like some coffee? Yes. Still mad at me? -No. What then? Go on, talk. Police! On the floor! What are you doing?! Show your hands! Come on, come on, follow him! Quickly! What are you waiting for? Jump! What to do with her? -Take her to the police station! Where? What for? Let me go! -Shut up! Should we open fire? He will run away! Shoot the legs. Let me go! What are you doing here? Mr. Inspector, I have come to surrender. You are crazy?! The whole department has seen you! I came as an ordinary citizen. I have the right. How did you let this kid run away from you? I didn't know we were chasing Spider-Man. I told you to let my people do this. Why the hell didn't you listen to me? Are you sure he's from Tsar's team? -Yes. I’ll kill this old goat. You have to tell me what's going on. Journalists don't get off all day. This car belongs to Dimitar. Are you kidding me? -No, I'm not joking. They killed that moron Christo and took the car. Dimitar will be furious. We were responsible for the safety of the boy. Can you imagine what will happen if we are kicked out of the game? Or if he finds out? -I'll handle that. You find that car. Don’t worry about it. I'll find it very soon. What to do with Tsar? -We'll see. And you break, kill, beat, do whatever you can, but find me this car. Clear? Clear. This is the beginning of our operation. To deal with the so-called Zvezdarski clan. This case was carried out with a big attention due to difficulties with the evidence base. I dare to assure you that this operation will succeed. As for the eventual litigation I would leave it my colleagues from the prosecutor's office. The corpse of a Bulgarian citizen discovered this morning. The police also associate with this group, the largest auto mafia in Belgrade. The corpse was discovered by public utilities... Tsar, did we bang the Bulgarian? Marash called? -No. Do you know where he is? -I have no idea. Wait. Are they going to chase us now? I mean all of us? In our garage there’s nothing you know. Find this idiot no matter what. Good, good. It's me, fuck! It's me, quiet! Paya, where is Bacha? I fell into a mess. Your mess doesn't interest me. There he is, drunk. Did Tsar call? Was someone looking for us? Cleverness was looking for you but obviously didn’t find you. Bacha! Get up! Wait a minute... -What the hell are you... Oh my God! Get out! Hey, leave me alone. Get out of here! What's the matter? Why are you naked? I ran away from the cops. From the cops? What did they say? They called and informed about the time and purpose of the visit. You moron, I have no idea! By phone? What are you talking about? Hold this. If you were smarter, now you would be using this rakia for drink and not to wash your feet. Listen, I don't think it's serious. Fuck! They shot me. How did they shoot you? -From weapons. They shot at you, or into the air? Explain to me. I don’t know, I didn’t have time to ask them. Fuck! I don't want to go back to jail! Stop it! What are you doing?! I don't want to go back to jail! -I just bought a car! I will kill someone. Who snitched us? I'm freaking out. -I'm definitely banging someone! Someone squealed! -Calm down, don't go crazy. I'll figure it out, but now we need to get out of here. We need to leave -Get dressed! Someone betrayed us. -Of course. Who? -I don’t know, but I know where to look. Marash? -No, this is not Marash. I've been looking for him since this morning. I'm listening. -Be here in an hour. How are you, Tsar, with eggs from the freezer? What the fuck is this? This is not shit. This is a big shit. You and your kids have done a lot of shit. I have no idea what is this all about. I swear. Explain to me. I see Stupar wants to set us up for murder. No one wants to set you up. That was doing of your jerk Marash. He brutally stabbed my friend from Bulgaria... Don't fuck with me. You know very well that we don't do that. I know, I know. You are now a respected businessman, you don't do dirty things. I myself was surprised when I found out. However... Things change, people change. Today anything can be expected. But to kill a man because of a car? Tsar, this is already too much. Maybe he killed himself? It’s not so easy to be your friend. What? Why did you come? To mock me? I'm not mocking you I've come to resolve the situation, like normal people. Do you think I'm crazy? Of course you are normal. Listen to me. We have nothing to do with it. I'll talk to Marash and find out, what he knows about it. He will tell me everything. I know him since he was a kid. You have nothing to talk with him! Find him, put him in the trunk and bring him to me. Got it? I get it. Fuck! My guys wanted to take you to the basement right away, I didn't allow it. I've told them: "This is Tsar, he is like an uncle to us." "Gotta give him a chance." I remember you always helped me, this is a trifle, but... What are you going to do with Marash? Do you care? Just tell him that his slut is with us. If he wants her back, it depends on him how he gets her, in whole or in pieces. Tell him like this. Why are you sitting?? Get out! Go to work. What the hell? Hello. Found? No. Either they don't have it, or they have hidden it well. They have it. I have already explained everything to Tsar, and you do your job, that’s all. Listen... where did you get that they killed Christo? I saw photos of the corpse. He looks like a werewolf killed him, and not a petty thief. And who, if not them? Maybe you? You knew that Christo is coming. What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with me? Just find a car and don’t ask unnecessary questions. All clear? Fucking bastard. Fucking moron. Marash! Marash! There is no one They have already left. When? -Don't know, in the morning. Marash fly in like mad and flew out the same way. His legs were bloody, he washed them with brandy. And he took the bottle with him. Now I have nothing. Wait... is he hurt? Yeah, his mind is hurt. "I'm selling AUDI rims, new. Does anybody want?" Incoming call. TSAR Brother, this is Tsar again. Should I answer the call? Do not answer anyone until I understand what's happening. Here he is. Just look at him. What did I tell you? Hey, what brings you here? -Quiet. What happened? -Who is upstairs? What the hell is that? -Who is upstairs? No one except mom! Hello aunt Zhivana! How are you? Watch your series, we won't bother you. We need to talk with your Dragan. Mom, I'm here, don’t worry. Brother, who beat you like that? Yes, some guys from the neighborhood. Fucking jerks, I'll show them... Who did you tell about Mercedes? -Are you crazy? For Mercedes? I'm not crazy. I didn’t tell anyone. What is it? Something happened? Ask Tsar if you don't believe me. I'll call him myself. Fuck you and Tsar, because of him, we have contacted you! Do you understand me? -Bacha, calm down! Nevermind. Give me an iron No iron, I beg! No, Marash! You know, I can’t stand the pain at all. Who did you tell about Mercedes? -I swear, to no one! I'm not an idiot! Palms up. Or we should burn your balls? Who did you tell about Mercedes? To no one, I told you. I swear! Look for plastic bags! Black, big. -Wait. Wait, wait. I told Stupar. But he forced me. You know Stupar. Why is the drug department interested in car? I don't know. Why is the drug department interested in car? That is Golub's car. And he is working with Stupar. Don't lie to us! Little faggot was driving that car. He's a Bulgarian kid, he just drove the car. That is Golub's car. I don’t know anything anymore, I swear! It burns! Where is your gun? -In the backpack. Why do you need a gun? No, don’t! You wanted to run away somewhere -No, please. Remember how much connects us! He wanted to run away! What? -Shut up! He wanted to run away, packed his things! Full package. Is nothing forgotten? Rotten mole! Let's go. Thanks bro! Gently, gently move! Front, rear! Like this. Let's go, let's go. How do you like my brother? -Oh, hi! Better and better. Do not stand out, put the block, otherwise, you will remain without a nose. Peter! -And I'm waiting for you on the street. You haven't seen me. What's up, kid? Are they still using you as a punching bag here? Are you still free? Everyone has their own training. Respect, respect, guys. Look, I have to lay low now. You were home when gendarmes came? Yes, there were at least 50 of them. The old one told them your new address right away And he took the phone from me so I couldn’t warn you. He is your father. Take care of them while I'm gone. I know, I'm sorry. -I need your help. This is a beast! I told you not to drive. -Don't worry, nobody saw me. Do you want to buy such a car for your little brother? You don't buy cars, my son. Go away, quick! I'll meet you! Bacha... Does this place belong to Peter? I don’t know, ask your brother. I've told you that we don't sell alcohol to minors. Why is it written "Marash?" Is this ours? It doesn’t matter, come here. No one should know, that you were here. -I know. -Give him money for a taxi. I don't want to leave, I want to stay with you. What are you talking about? If we have to screw the cops, we will screw them... Who are you going to screw? You can be on the street, only on the way to school or to the gym. You only need to study, do sports and chase girls. Do you understand everything? Yes, It's clear. Apart from studying. Come on, go. And to screw, my son. I don’t get it. Why is Golub so furious? The car is good, but he can buy ten of these. Wow. What is it? This car is much better than I thought. How much is here, what do you think? A lot. -What are we going to do? To find out Golub's phone number. Let's welcome the coolest guy! Proud Golub and his crew. Hi Mara! Dima, brother... My condolences... Sorry, I've entirely forgotten that they have live music today. I am truly sorry Want a drink? Whiskey? Chivas? Rakia? Do you want a bottle of mineral water to go along with coffee? No. Good. Christo, Christo... God, have mercy on his soul. He didn't deserve such a death. He wasn't always serious when it comes to business, you know that. but he was a good guy, cheerful, positive. I don't know. I can only tell you, that I am very ashamed. Because everything happened in my city. What can you do? Not just happened. Someone killed him like a dog! We know who did this, we all know. Don't worry. The killer will soon meet with Christo. Do you think he was killed because of Mercedes? And because of what else? I repeat. We know who did this and where he is, we know all. Stupar has come. You can ask him. You know each other? -Yes. Sorry for being late. Accept my sincere condolences. We will find this bastard. We know everything about them! Fucking snotty thieves. I should have killed them two years ago. Fucking kids. Is there any news for me? -No. When can I pick up ... -The body of my Christo? In a few days. In a few days? Organize everything by tomorrow. They want to go home. Tomorrow. A pity... It’s a pity that the guy is no more. But we will regret even more if our business stops because of this... Am I right? There will be no business, until the killer is alive. My friend, In this case, our cooperation will continue very quickly. No problems. -I want to return home tomorrow with money. With money? You will get your money when I get my car. Your son drove a car. I haven't seen it. Maybe it was empty. Really? Yes, like that. What are you looking at? Why the hell didn't you answer my calls? I didn't let him. You didn't? -Yes. We had to see what’s going on. And have you seen? You find out what shit we got into because of you? Give me the keys. -Give me Golub's number. I see you know who the owner is. -Yes And I know what is in the car. -Good. Now you know everything. And? How do you know? -I found out. I met with Golub. Now you are friends? We tried to solve the problem. I'm trying to save your fucking skin. And what have you decided? You will give me the keys, and I will give him the car. Easy, for a hundred thousand. The price was ten but now a hundred. There is about 30 kg, that's half a million, fuck, he will get a discount. Oh, you become a big player. Did you grow balls? Are you so cool now that you can strike Golub and extort it? And the fact that he will kill us all, You don't give a fuck? Give me a cigarette. Everything can be solved in another way, if he immediately called me about a car. Instead, they broke into my house, shot me, torture my girlfriend! Unlike you I don't know how to hide behind an umbrella when they piss on my face. Don't talk to me like that! -Stop it! You deserved it! You had to wait for me first, and then go to Golub. Move. Wait for you? Let me ask you one question. Do you smoke? Or are you on pills? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you know who Golub works for? For the cops and the state administration. Yes, for such a large amount they immediately dig a grave. I would be in that grave this morning, if I didn't escape from them. Give me the keys. I will take care of everything. I won't give the keys until I see Sophia and money. You will have both Sophia and money. Believe me. Hell no. I’ll get thirty bullets in the back of the head, if I pretend that nothing happened. And you know it. Marash... Son... How long have we been working together? Has anything ever happened? No. Because you were smart. And you listened to me. Perhaps I shouldn't have listened to you. Tsar, I think you know who told them about the car and where I live. You see... It turns out that we have common problems And my problems are only mine. We're screwed. Go out. -I won't let you go alone. Cut the crap! I have to do it myself. Come on already! Look, he smokes weed! Old hippie! Where is my car? -I have them... ...obviously not. Where is Marash? Who knows? Montenegro, Halkidiki, Maldives. No idea. Have I come here that this old junkie fucks my brains? Tsar, let's have this shit solved, please! Give Marash to me, a car to Golub, and we will be happy. You know very well that Marash isn't related to this murder. It was your fault Because you gave that jerk to drive. As you can see, the fact that you've stabbed him and threw the corpse into the trash, didn't help. -Me? What are you talking about? Cut the crap! I'll kill you both. You'll call him now, and tell him to come in five minutes. You understood me? -No way. Go upstairs and kill everyone you find in the house. First, you'll have to bang me. I won’t let anyone fuck my brains. This is my city. And mine too. Yes? Hello Golub. This is Marash. Marash, where were you all day? Wait, I'll turn on the speakerphone, let everyone hear you. Come on, turn it on. Yes, we are listening to you. Tomorrow, at ten, we are waiting for you in ''Amsterdam'', I want to see Sophia and a hundred in cash, or I’ll throw your car in the river. Listen here, snotty bastard You will see Sophia in the video. when ten junkies fuck her in a row. There will be so much sperm... children will be able to skate for ten days. Damn it. Fortunately, there are lots of other chicks around. I’ll sell my car cheaper to neighbors tomorrow I'll be in the Maldives, and you will be left with nothing. Do you want that? Marash, your friend Tsar is with me. Kneeling in front of me, like in a church. Do you want to hear how I cut him like a pig? Since he is already on his knees, let him suck you. If something depended on him, this old fag would give you a car, with a surcharge. Waiting for you at ten tomorrow. Come along yourself, don't send me your assholes. You wanted to sacrifice your family for this guy? Yes, you really are a fag. Let's go. And what to do with him? The hell with it. Let's go. Wait. You killed Christo? Yes. Do you have something against that? -Of course I have! If Dimitar finds out, he will block the channels from Turkey and Bulgaria. What then? -Will we work with Albanians. Speak to me like that again, and we will find a replacement for you too. Got it? -Yes. Do you want a smoke? What do you want? I wanted to say that it is easier to agree with me than with Golub. I have nothing to negotiate with you. At the moment, you and I have a common problem - Golub. I have no more problems. And you solve your own. You could develop your business. Cars... A lot of work but a small amount of cash. I’m already good like this. You get to keep your family together. If you understand what I’m saying. Do you understand what I mean? You can’t see him. He has an important meeting. Tell him that the question is urgent. We have problems with the bird. Wait. It's gate, copy. Stupar has arrived. He says it's urgent. Problems with the bird. I understand. Hand over the weapon. Go straight, then ... -I know. They've told me that today would be sunny all day, but it seems not. Yeah, well, I agree. I thought I could rest all day today, but obviously not. Sorry, I really had to. Tell me. I have a problem with the bird. It won't listen. It attacks the neighbors. Shits all over the furniture. What about the neighbors? Did they hurt her somehow? Well no. They made noise, turned on the music loudly, but I could agree with them. What about the furniture? Big shit. The whole grandfather's furniture. Everything is simple here. Living with a crazy bird is impossible. Find yourself another. -Clear. Do you want it? -Thank you, I don't like the liver. Still, take care of it. -I will. Bro, they are not here. Maybe they changed their minds? But what if they shoot us as soon as we get out of here? They won't shoot. It's a big crowd here. Yes, you are right. Here they are. I know that bald scumbag. Where is Golub? Where is Sophia, where is the money? Golub told you to think it over again, Just return the car, and everything will be all right. What is that? -Free copy. I’ll give the real one when I get Sophia and the money. Call Golub and tell him to come here or I will go to Novi Pazar or Kosovo. Let's get this shit done. Do you really think Golub will come to you? You will have to come with us if you want to get dibs and your slut. Call Golub and tell him to come here. Now. What is wrong with you today? -Shut up! You want me to call Golub and tell him like that? Yes, literally. Listen ... -No, you listen to me. When they return... take the money, Sophia and get out of here. And I'll do it on the way to the car. Whom are you going to do? -Him. Why? Are you crazy? Why are they leaving? What the hell is that? I'm telling you. it will end badly. Look dude! Fuck! -Press and hold it like that! It's okay, it's just a scratch. Of course, a scratch. Find someone, darn you. -Do you think so? Take me to the hospital! Which hospital? What are you talking about? We bring down the hill! We have a car and goods, we’ll raise a ton of dough. Are you crazy? I will die of blood loss. Fear not, you will not die! Don't make me nervous! We play this game together! I don't want to be together anymore! It is enough. I knew that this would happen! I warned you. I knew it! -Take it easy! Will you hand me over to the veterinary clinic there? Do you want me to die like a dog?! -Of course not. Then take me to the hospital. And go to hell! What is this slut doing here? Still not talking. - Well, beat her. We wanted to ask you first. Why? -Tell him. Speak! Speak! I am expecting a baby. Pregnant? Congratulations. Your fucking boyfriend left you in such a situation. You need to rest, sleep more... -He doesn’t know. Doesn’t know? - No, he doesn’t. Call him and say. Let him know before he escapes. Tell him yourself if you dare. Wow, what a dirty tongue. No wonder so many dicks you have licked. Surely less, than your mother. Take her down. And bring Yani, we have a walk with him. Not a single car. There is no one. If not here, then I have no idea where he is. Can I go? You promised to let me go if I show the garage. Of course, you can go as I promised. Raiko! Thanks, Stupar. -Get out! You're welcome. Down! Lay down on the floor! Down! Do not move! Where is Peter? -We don't know. I will repeat the question. Where is Peter? We have not seen him ... Don't! We don't know! Shut up! The police are also looking for him, but we don’t know anything! Nothing! -Leave the gun if you have balls! Shut up! -Please don’t! Do not move! So let's see ... Listen old man, tell Peter, tell him to give up. If he refuses, I will take this kid and send it to you in parts. Do you understand? Got it?! We are leaving! Down! Paya... -Go away. What happened? You happened, motherfucker. Get out, or I'll kill you. Paya, are you all right? Run, before I kill you! Hello? -They came. Who came? -They came. Who, mom? They were looking for you. Who came? Peter, call them and say that we don’t know anything. Can you hear me? Say we don't know anything... Mom, who was looking for me?! -Don't know ... Hello, mom? -Peter, son, this is your mom. We haven't seen each other since your Spider-Man show. You know who's talking to you? Hello, Inspector. How are you? What? Not happy to hear from me? No, I’m just in roaming. Speak fast. Are you abroad? Yes. I decided to relax a bit. Sorry, you can’t protect your family. I've heard they had guests. -Yes, old friends came by. Congratulations, you staged a grand performance in the city today. He was supposed to pay. Everything would have turned out differently. I didn’t know that you were such a moron. What did you expect? That he will give you money, chick, and ticket to Hawaii? Okay, you can suck me. Wait, I completely forgot. Congratulations. For what? -Don't fool around. You will become a dad soon. Hello? Marash? Do you hear me? Sophia will be a great mother. It is a pity that his father escaped before his birth. And it will grow without a father. Are you kidding? -Such things are not for joking. I will kill you. Even worse, the child will spend his first years in prison. On the other hand, if the kid is like you, let him get used to it on time. So. Now we need to go to the forensic institute. My people will help you get things done quickly. Thank you, Stupar. You’ll go first. Yes, chef. I've heard that my Afghan and Turkish friends are looking for new partners. I know. But we will take all measures to stay in this business. The man who killed my son. I want him to die. Don't look at me like you don’t know who did it. I know. Do it, and it will pay off. Don't move. Oh, Marash. What happened? Did not like the sea? Give me your gun. Drive. Stop here. Get out. I hope you haven't brought me here to look at the stars, to breathe fresh air. We need to talk. Call your monkeys. Tell them to let Sophia go. Immediately! I can’t let out criminals just like that. Calmly, son! Calm down. I am a reasonable person. You can always agree with me. As you agreed with Yani, motherfucker. Take it easy. You know that I have nothing to do with that. As well as I know that you didn't kill this kid from Bulgaria. Why are you feeling sorry for Yani? He gave you away after two slaps. What do you want? -To talk to you. We can solve everything, except for our common problem... Golub. Are you kidding? You’re working with Golub all the way, as his personal Indian Never Indian, only cowboy. We are dealing with a psychopath. He fucked up our business. It harms my business, harms your business. It’s time for him to go. Well, let's say I help you. What will happen to Sophia? What will happen to Tsar? It is obvious. I am not that kind of person. I would never harm a pregnant woman or an old person for no reason. And what about me? If we push a little, help... Four maximum five years. How do I know that you're not trying to set me up? You will have to trust me. Nenad... Nenad...Nenad! He is not here. Lazar! Lazar, Nenad is gone. What happened? -He went after Peter! Wait! I will go! Do not worry. No one followed me. Yes, you know that. Brought it? Where is Mercedes? None of your damn business. Does it hurt? -Not really. You should have seen me after the match. What will happen now? What should happen will happen. But until tomorrow everything will be decided. Peter, I beg you. Please don't take him with you! Get out of the car. I beg you! -Get out! Do you want to die because of him? He is your son! -You are my son too! Where are you going? Wait! The main advantage of a residential and business complex Serbian dream consists in the fact that it will be built 2km from the city center, close to all major city events, while the surrounding nature will remain untouched. We are talking about different parks, near the Danube. This place will provide future residents with a comfortable feeling of isolation from the city's bustle. On the other hand, we can... Really? Where are you going? We'll have dinner, people will wait there. Tell them not to worry, we will transfer the money. This was one of the main requirements of our partners. Should we take everything? Yes, I don't want to take risks. You found the jeep? -Near Golub's restaurant. Fine. We are leaving as soon as you pack. What brings you here, old man? You changed your mind? But now it's too late. Will you let Golub to kill the boy? It doesn’t matter who kills whom. They will all die tonight. Then you will die too, idiot! Hey, Tsar... Put down the gun. I was kidding. You've come in time. Look at him. Golub, I... Look, how lovely! That's what I call perfectly fried meat! Like a two ballerinas! I would cheat my wife with them. Well, let's get acquainted. Is your name Marash? Golub, I have come to apologize. I know what I did and I want to fix everything. To fix? How? Say "sorry" and you're done? No, I will return the car to you. -Will you return the car? Will you give me back my car? No, well, first you have to demand money. To beat me, torture me a little. -Fuck, I'm sorry, I fucked up everything. I will return you a car with an extra charge, as you say. I want it to be over tonight. I'm alone in this. -Listen. Now you will take me to the car. And then... And then I'll decide what to do with you. What is this? Is this a setup? -No! Bacha parked here... -Who is Bacha? Bacha, my friend... -Listen... If that old fart or someone else jumps out of there now, I will kill your father, mother and your whore, do you hear me? No, man. There is no one. You go first, in case it is mined. People say you are a smart guy. And with big balls... But it turns out you're a stupid asshole and a fool. I can`t believe it! Finally, my car! Give me the keys! I brought you to the car. Promise me you won’t take revenge. Give me the fucking keys! Did you really think you could get away with it? Yes. Bastard! Fuck! Do you want to be the boss?! I won't let you. I'll fuck you in all holes. Fuck! I also have my people! I have my own people! Bitch! What do you want? Do you want money, bitch? Stupar sends you greetings! Grandpa's boy. Sleep, sleep... Hey, Tsar... Marash is here. Look at him! Granddad's kid. Take it gently. I'm not very good with children. How is Bacho? -He'll be fine. The operation lasted five hours. Healthy guy, like a bull. Sorry, I pulled us all into this terrible shit. But I solved the problem, as I promised. О, yes. I've heard that Golub is gone, flew away. -How do you know? I know. Because such things aren't solved with steel balls and a gun. It only happens in the movies. In real life, everything is decided by bargaining. Everyone needs to get something. Someone will get a bullet, someone will get money. someone will get a new job. Someone will get a second chance, girl and child. We are a family. I hope you finally figured it out. Forgive me. Fuck it... No pension for me. I have to work hard to feed this kid. Take care of them. -Sure! I have one more daughter-in-law now. and another grandchild. Take care of yourself, Marash. Don't spoil them. -Good. I'm Peter Marash. I've heard that you are looking for me. Here I am. Get up. You can go. Just like that? Are you tired of me? Not just like that. Your boyfriend has just surrendered. Lovely guy, made a deal and took all the blame. You can talk to him, if you want. Damn if I knew how you look without makeup I would never hit on you. -Fuck you. Sorry. You're an idiot. Yes. Leave before I change my mind. -I do not want to leave. Sophia... Go away. Come on. -Take her out. Sit down. Get over there. It was not necessary to beat her. Damn, we did not know that she was pregnant. If you're interested, she did not say a word. This girl has bigger balls than all of you together. Do you know who gave me this lighter? Golub. Do you know why I keep it? So that it reminds me of what happens, in our business, with stupid and greedy people. I knew that he would end up badly. What about you? You're the only one left in shit. I’ll survive somehow. And when I get out... we'll start all over again. I hold you to it. We are starting a news program about the latest events in Belgrade. Early in the morning, the police carried out the South Wind operation, during which the police has cut another channel of drug trafficking from the south of our country My condolences. The problem is solved. I know. We continue to work. Four prominent criminals were killed in a shootout with police. Officials say that they will continue to fight this type of organized crime. The dead were accomplices in a previous murder of Bulgarian citizen Christo Mitevsky, This operation is a powerful hit and a signal to the drug cartels. I would like to thank all the staff who participated in this case. And we promise that we will not stop here, because health and future our children are priceless. Meet our new friend. My condolences. Thank you.
