[light music] [grunting] - Give her a hand. - Come on you swabs, put your back into it. We've gotta bury this treasure before sundown! - [Man] Lower away! [men screaming] [kooky music] - Oh Jesus. - You stupid swine! I'll kill ya! - There. I don't understand why we couldn't go. How are we gonna find out where Flint buried the treasure, eh? [men groaning] - Ah, Billy Bones. You're as boneheaded as a backward blowfish. [men laughing] [laughing] You wanna be out there with Flint? Burying the biggest treasure ever found in the Spanish main? You really think he's gonna let any of those swabs live after they've buried it for him? - Blowfish, is it? Well I don't think I need the insults, Long John Silver. - No you don't, now, do you? - No I bloody don't. - And what are you gonna do about it? - I'll show you what I'm gonna do about it. [tense music] [men chattering] - Ah! Carry on, Bill. [man groaning] [man screaming] [bashing] - Silver! I'll show you how crazy I am! - [Man] Watch out, Silver!

Can I help you? - For starters, just a glass of rum for an old seafaring man on a cold wet day. - Yes, sir. [man coughing] Here you go, sir. - Oh, that's the stuff, lad. That's the stuff. You get many customers here? - No, sir. - Not many folks around these parts? - [Kid] No, sir. - Just you in here alone? - No, sir, my grandmother's upstairs, sir. But she's ailing, sir, and bedridden. - Oh, sir, sir, sir. They ain't knighted me and they ain't likely to. Just call me, call me Captain. - Yes, sir. I mean, Captain. - What be your name? - Jim Hawkins. - Well, Jim. You ever see a seafaring man in these parts with one leg? - No, Captain. - Or a blind man with a burn like this? - No. - Well then. You ever heard of pieces of eight? - Yes, sir. - Well this be one of them. And it be yours if you ever see such men, aye? Do us purdy little encouragement like. Keep your eyes open and tell me if you ever see such men in these parts. Now Jim, fetch me a rum. - Yes, Captain. [light music] [sign creaking] [woman coughing] - You have bad blood. Relieve the pressure on your brain as much as we can. You've drunk your fill here. You can still do a little good. This should help, Mrs. Hawkins.

And you, Jim will kindly fetch me a basin and my instruments. They're in my saddlebag. - Yes, sir. [ripping] - Prophetic. Well, Mr. Billy Bones. We can see the color of your blood. No time for leeches or other niceties. You're not afraid of the sight of blood, are you, Jim? - No, sir. Just heights. - Hold that basin steady. Well, hold his wrist. - Where's Black Dog? - There's no Black Dog here. You were drinking rum, you had a stroke. And I, very much against my better judgment have dragged you head foremost from the grave. Now, Mr. Bones. - My name is not Bones. - I'm told it is. Now I tell you this. One glass of rum won't kill you. But one will lead to two, and two to three, and I'll stake my name that if you don't stop, you'll die. I don't know. In view of my conscience, make it simple. The name of rum for you is death. [lightly tense music] [knocking] - [Billy] Who is it? - I've got your dinner, Captain. - It's not food I need, sonny Jim. It's rum. - But remember what the doctor said? - Ah, doctors. Doctors is all swabs. I've been in lands hot as pitch, mates falling with the yellow jack. What do doctors know of lands like that? And I survived, Jim. I survived on rum. I've lived on rum. And I need to drink. Man and wife to me, I don't need doctors. [clanking from below] What was that? - I'm not sure. [door creaking] [lightly tense music] [gasping] - Will any kind soul inform a poor man whose eyes have been blinded by a wicked buccaneer as to which part of the country he may now be in? - Admiral Benbow Inn, sir. - Take my arm, sonny so that you may lead me in to see the Captain. - I don't dare, sir! - Take me in straight or I'll break your arm! - But I fear for you, sir. He's got a cut that's in-- - Don't fear for me, son. Fear for yourself. Now lead me in. - Captain. I've got a friend for you. [coughing] - Billy Bones, I can tell by the smell. - Pew. Now that you've found me, what do you want with me? - Old business, man. - I have no business with you. - I've spent the last five years of my life searching for the man that took my sight. And when I found him, I found that what I wanted wasn't there. - [laughing] And what was that, Pew? - Hell, what do you think it was? The chart to the treasure, now where is it? - Ah, I don't know what you're talking about. - Well perhaps a blind man can't find it but certainly, others can. There, that's done. - What's that? - It's the black spot, Jim. It's a summons. It's a message, this. This one says they're coming for me. They're coming for what I've got! But I'll not give it to them. I'll not give it to them, Jim. I'll give it to you. Go to the chest, the chest! Take what's yours. Pick it up. Hurry, boy, hurry, they're coming. That's just lead shot. That's my lucky blowfish, boy. Hurry, hurry! That's just a swordfish bill from Madagascar. Get the chart, get the map! Yeah. Where is it, Jim? Where is it? [Billy coughing] [groaning] - The Captain! [suspenseful music] - Bloody long walk, Black Dog. Bloody rum in this Inn? - Mind the rum, you lubber. Now you got the key to the greatest treasure in the Spanish main. And you're worried about rum? Robert! Stand lookout! [lightly tense music] [woman gasping] [men chattering] [woman screaming] - [Man] I'll go search upstairs! - [Man] Ah, get off! - Never mind upstairs. This is where the room is! Billy, Billy, we've come to get you. It's time. Ah, dead, well. Good riddance to you. Hey! [tense music] I'll get you, boy! - Gran, Gran, gotta go! Gotta get out! - My purse, say Jim, what be it? - [Jim] We gotta go. We're gonna go. Come on, Gran, come on. - Where be Molly? - [Jim] I don't know, Gran, no time, come on! Come on, Gran! - [Man] Where's Billy Bones at?! - [Man] Where is he? Ah, let's get him! [men shouting] [thudding] - [Pew] I'll get you, boy! - Catch! [screaming] - [Pew] What the hell?!

[Black Dog screaming] [groaning] - Come on Jim, don't do it! No, don't go, don't go. [exclaiming] Jim, are you all right? - [Jim] Jump, Gran, jump! - I daren't. - [Black Dog] I'll get you! [Gran screaming] Come back here, you young whelp! [hooves clopping] - Revenue agent! [gun firing] [men shouting over each other] - What is it? Who's coming? [guns firing] Don't leave me, you cowards! - [Man] Somewhere in the back! - [Man] Get him now. [groaning] [cracking] [men chattering] [guns firing] - Who's there? - It's Hawkins, sir! - Young Tom Hawkins? - [Jim] Yes, sir! It's Jim, sir. - [Old Man] Ah. - This man is dead. - Who is he? - Pirates, sir. There's a whole crew of 'em. - I was right. About that ship that sailed into Kit Hole. What they want with you? - I think this, sir. - What is it? - I believe it's the map to Captain Flint's treasure. - My god! - Well perhaps I should take that for safekeeping. - Now, now, Doctor, not so fast. - Well considering the boy found it, and I am a doctor and a magistrate. - Please, Doctor, as Chief Revenue Agent for the county of Cornwall. - Gran, Gran! Gran! Doctor! Doctor, come here! Gran, wake up. [somber music] Doctor, is she? - I'm afraid so, Jim. There's nothing more I can do for her now. Commissioner Dunce and I have agreed that I should take this now to show to Squire Trelawney. - Doctor, wait. I think that since the chart was given to me, and, well, - Out with it, boy! - I think I should come with you, at least. - Yes, very well. Saddle up then, we'll ride together. [light music] [hooves clopping] - Smugglers? Right here in the county? What is England coming to, huh? - Not just smugglers, sir. And pirates! - Pirates eh? What of them? - Two dead at the Admiral Benbow. A few arrests, the rest flown. And the boy's poor grandmother dead from the excitement and trouble of it all. - Is that true? - I'm afraid so. - My condolences. - Thank you. - There is this, Squire. - What is it? - Well, it claims to be the map to Flint's Treasure. - Captain Flint? The bloodiest buccaneer that ever lived? - The same. This could solve your financial problems, Squire. - Yeah. Perhaps it could. Let's have a look. That's an island. Latitude and longitude clearly defined, you'll notice. Incredible. Half of England is after this chart. Well, that's enough for me, I'm all for it. Will you join me, Doctor? - Squire, the boy feels that well, the chart was given to him. - Well then he'll join us too. After all, there's nothing for you here now, Hawkins, is there? There'll be riches enough for all. A three way split once we paid off the crew. I'll fit up a ship in Bristol. Admiral, ship's doctor, cabin boy. Are you with me? - There's only one man I'm afraid of. - Name the dog. - You, sir. - What? - You're too much of an enthusiast and you can't hold your tongue. These buccaneers tonight, they want this treasure just as badly as you do. I implore you. This is just between the two of us. - But... - The three of us. - You're as sensible and blunt as ever, Doctor. And I pledge there'll not be a word from me until we set foot on this, this, treasure island. [light music] [men chattering] [cock crowing] [pig snorting] [women laughing] - Thank you. - Caught this morning, what more could you want? What more could you want, miss? [chickens clucking] [sheep bleating] - Hey, sailor. You looking for someone? - Well I'm not quite a sailor yet. But I am looking for a ship. The Hispaniola. - Ah, thought you might have been looking for company. Pretty darling. Office just down there. - Thank you. Ma'am. [chuckling] - When will she be ready? - Very soon, very soon. - Hockles! Mussels! - That's what I've been trying to tell you sir. I'll be frank with you. I don't like this cruise. I don't like the men, and I don't like the first mate. And that's the short and sweet of it. - Is it now? And perhaps you don't like your new employer either, is that what you're trying to say? - Now, stay a bit, Squire, stay a bit. Either our Captain's said too much or too little, I'd like to find out which. Now sir, why? Why don't you like this cruise? - Squire? - Ah, Hawkins. One of us. Cabin boy. We're just having a discussion. - Cabin boy or one of you? I mean that's my point, Squire. I'm used to cruises where crew is crew and Captain's word is law, and everyone's working for the employer. In yours, all this is mixed up together! - What are you talking about? - I arranged to hire a crew of my choosing. Then you go off and hire them all based on the word of this Silver fellow. - Silver, who's Silver? - Well the man I wrote to you about, for heaven's sake. A capital fellow. Long John Silver, they call him. He used to be a ship'squartermaster, and then a cook. We met quite by chance. And he helped me put together a company of the toughest old salts you can imagine. - That's right. And I'm hired under sealed orders to sail this ship wherever you should bid me. And now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I. - Knows what? - That we're sailing for treasure, that's what I hear. And I hear it from deck hands. - I never told that to a soul. - Well it doesn't matter who told what. The point is there's been too much blabbing! I don't like treasure cruises and I particularly don't like them when the secret's been told to the parrot. - Silver's parrot? - It's a manner of speaking, sir. - All right then. What would you have us do about it? - [Captain] I'll tell you what I'd do about it. - Perhaps, Hawkins, you needn't listen to all this. Would you deliver this for me? I take it Captain, we're still sailing with the tide tomorrow? Well then Jim, get this to Long John Silver. You'll find him at the Spyglass Inn. Now, now, you'll find him, run along and ask anyone. - Yes, sir. - Now Captain, you were saying. - Right, now first of all the guns. I mean what sort of expedition allows the crew to fill the focsle with arms? - Hey, darling. What are you looking for now? - Spyglass Inn, Ma'am. Do you know where that is? - The Spyglass? What you wanna go there for? It's just up off the high street, me lovely. [chicken clucking] [men chattering] - Get out of here! - Stay out till you're sober, Three Sheets! [men shouting indistinctly] - Excuse me. But do you know if there's a Mr. Silver here? - Ah. I'd be Long John Silver, lad. - You, sir? - [Billy Voiceover] You ever see a seafaring man with one leg. - And why not, boy? It's a good a name as any other. You'd be? - Jim Hawkins, sir. New cabin boy at the Hispaniola. And Squire Trelawney asked me to give you this. - Ah. Jim Hawkins. So we're going on a cruise together, are we, Jimmy? We're to sail with the tide tomorrow. Well that's good, that's good. I'll have everyone there. [woman screaming] Aye, aye. I'll even bring Captain Flint with me. - Captain Flint? - Aye. You want to sail with us, don't you, Captain? Come. [chuckling] - Pieces of eight, - Another round over here, - pieces of eight! - mind you. - [John] Coming up, coming up. - Black Dog! - You! You're dead! [crashing] I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Don't hide! Get out of the way! [horse braying] - Morgan! Don't let him catch that boy! [Black Dog grunting] [light music] - Oh! What now, darlin'? - Black Dog! - Make way! - [Man] Hey! Watch where you're going now! [chickens clucking] - [Jim] Help, help! [chuckling] - [Man] Hey! Watch where you're going now. [tense music] - You're knackered, boy. [gasping] [splashing] [light music] - You! Come here! [chickens clucking] [horse neighing] [pigs squealing] [splatting] - Help! [screaming] [chuckling] - Poxy ass! I'm gonna get you! - Get away from me! - Ugh! [bashing] [splashing] [light music] [bell dinging] [man shouting commands indistinctly] - Look at that. [parrot squawking] - Hey, Barbecue.

I'll show you. And you don't have to ask the governor for no permission either. Come on, boy, get up here. I'll race you to the crow's nest. Come on. [lightly suspenseful music] Go!

Get out here. Come on. [tense music] This is how you get down. - [Jim] [screaming] Captain! [bashing] - What are you doing, boy? Get below, I never wanna see your disgusting face above deck again! - [Jim] Yes, sir, sorry sir. [light music] [birds squawking] [man groaning] - How are you taking to the sea, Doctor? No sign of the scurvy, I hope. - Not as yet. - Fruit's my cure for it. Barrel of apples open to all on the way down south. Empty by landfall and fill it with limes for the journey home. - Can't do any harm, I suppose. - Perhaps we should have one now. Care to join me? Squire? - Thank you. - Cabin boy! Cabin boy! Three good apples from the barrel, boy and there's a lad. - [Jim] Yes, sir. - [Man] What I wanna know, Barbecue, is when are we gonna take over the ship? - [John] Keep your voice down. [tense music] - We keep standing off and on like a blasted bombot! I've had enough of this Captain Smollett. He's hazed me long enough. - Yes sir. I'm sick of it an all, right. I could rip em' all stir a gurgeon. Specially that old geezer. - The old geezer? I want that boy. He's the one that killed Black Dog. - Listen, you swabs. You live hard and you'll speak softer when I give the word. And you can lay to that, both of you! - Well I don't say no, do I? What I say is when? - The last moment I can manage. Now here's the couple of gentlemen with the map so I intend to help them find the treasure. And have the Captain navigate us halfway back. - Why? We're all sailors here. - Ah, old focsle hands, you mean. We can steer a course, but who's to set one? Now we all spent five long years trying to find Flint's map. So we can wait a few more days before we strike. - Fine. But what'll we do with them when we do make our move? - Well. I'm not one for marooning. - Yeah, like Billy Bones used to say. Dead men don't bite, do they? [men laughing] - Yeah. Now all this yammerin's givin' me a thirst, eh, Israel? Pass me an apple there, now that's a good boy. - All right, peg leg. - [Man] Land ho! - Hey, there you go, mates. Another cross, another part for us. Bah! [men chattering] - What? I don't see anything. - See that dot there on the horizon? That's what the shout is all about. Well, don't look so dumb, cash boy. Give the Hispaniola another day of sailin', and, it'll be a little more impressive, eh? - John. - Aye. - Squire. I have to talk to you immediately. I have some terrible news. - Not now, Jim. We've sighted land. - But it's about the men. And it's about treason, sir. And mutiny. - Squire. It's best we both listen to what the boy has to say. - Merry and Hands said they should do it now but Mr. Silver held them back. He said he wanted to wait till the treasure was found. - So, Silver is the leader? - Yes, definitely. - Captain, you were right and I was wrong. I was an ass. So now I await your orders. - Well, I accept your apology. We men of the sea have perhaps a little quicker insight into these matters. - Yes, yes, yes but what are we going to do about it? - It isn't gonna be easy. Silver is obviously a rather remarkable fellow. - He'd live remarkably good hanging from the end of a yard arm. But never mind that. Here's a plan for you. I've noticed that the old boy has become rather chummy with the young lad here. Oh yes, I see things. I know what's going on. And I'm thinking once we reach the island, we'll let the men go to shore and Jim can go along with them. Bit of a fox amongst the chickens if you take my meaning. - See what he can find out, that sort of thing? - Exactly. [adventurous music] [men shouting indistinctly] - Have any of you men ever seen this island before? - I have, skipper. We careened there on the ship I was quartermaster of. - In the anchorage on the south shore? - Ah, yes, skipper. It was a main place for pirates, they say. - Enough water there for the Hispaniola to get in? - Oh yes, sir, yes, I think so, sir. - Well we'll soon find out. As soon as we drop anchor, I want a party to go ashore for fresh water and fruit. - [John] I have a plan. [light music] - [Man] Let go of the anchor! [splashing] - Days away! Jim, Jim. Come with us, boy. See the island, it's a sweet one. I get ashore on an island like that, I almost forget my timber leg, huh. And you, you got 10 toes, you're gonna love it! Ah. [chuckling] - Come on! - Hey, what have you got? - Yep, what do you think, eh? - God bless you my son. - And this. - Oh, you must love me. - Oh I do. - And the rum. You forgot that didn't you? - Watch out for the sharks, Jim. You wanna keep all those toes and fingers, eh? - Hey, Silver! - Aye? - Yeah enough with the friendly. You've got the boy here and that's all well and good. Now it's time to get it out of him. - Now what are you talking about, now leave the boy be. - Now come on John, we've all heard the tale. The boy's the one that got the chart out of Billy Bones, innit? Yeah. And the Squire's as good as got it published by now. Listen son. We don't expect you to have that chart in your pocket. But I'll wager you've got the spot where that gold's bloody buried burnt into that little noggin of yours like a cow brand, right? - No, sir. - Wrong answer. - Where'd you get that? You're not supposed to have arms! - Eh, that's all right, Jim, it's not primed. - No, that's true, Jim. It ain't primed. But this is. [laughing] - Help! - Yeah, go on son, you scream. 'Cause they ain't never gonna hear you in a month from Sundays. - Easy, George. - Hey, I'm gonna snarf it out of him, John. You see if I don't. [bashing] - [George] [laughing] You idiot, come here! [bashing] [George groaning] - Come here, you! Come here you! You little sore! You stop! [bashing] [groaning] - I hope it was a good idea sending young Hawkins in with those brigands. - I'm sure he'll be fine. But if there is a problem, well surely he's the most expendable one of us. Meanwhile I think we have an opportunity here that shouldn't be missed. Let's lock those that are left in the brig for safekeeping. - On what charge? - I'll think of something. [tense music] [light music] [lightly tense music] [both screaming] [both screaming] - Oh, my heart. Are you real? - Of course I'm real, who are you? - I'm Ben Gunn. Who are you? - Jim Hawkins. - Jim Hawkins? You haven't got any cheese on you have you? Of course you haven't. I haven't seen another man or heard another voice or had any cheese for three years! - Three years? Were you shipwrecked? - No, mate. Marooned. - Hmm. Marooned? You're not a pirate, are you? - No, are you? - No. But I've sailed in with some. - Not Captain Flint? He's gonna kill me. - No, Flint's dead. I sailed in with Captain Smollett. [bird squawking] ♪ Round and round and oh ♪ And a he hung down and ringaling ♪ ♪ She's a nice girl, a decent girl ♪ ♪ And one of the rank is fine - [Smollett] Where did you get that from? - It's hot. You let the others go ashore, I figured it was time for some grog. - You drink grog if and when I say you can. - We're not at sea. I'll drink it now. - Israel Hands, I'm clapping you in the brig. - [Israel] What for? - Insolence. Suspicion of mutiny. - I'm not going to no brig. - [Smollett] You better stop or I'll fire. - [Man] No, you won't! [gun firing] - Who's shooting? - I don't know. Let's go find out. - [Smollett] Doctor, Squire! To arms, mutiny! - They've gone in here! Like rats in a barrel. [gun firing] - Squire, we're trapped! - [Squire] Don't be silly, Hunter. [groaning] - [Doctor] Are you all right, Redruth? - Yes, sir. - [Doctor] Good man, follow me up. - Take the longboat, Squire! - [Man] They're gonna go hunt! - Give me a gun. [gun firing] - Hurry, Squire! - Gimme a gun! [gun firing] - Got it. [shattering] - Quick, get the map! The rest of you, cut them off! [rifle booming] [screaming] [screaming] - Where are you, sir? [men shouting] - Pull her in! Pull away! - Sir, don't leave without me! - Jump then, jump! [splashing] [gun firing] - Stop him! - No, pick him up! Swim for it, Hunter! - [Doctor] Pull him with all you've got! [guns booming] - [Smollett] On the starboard. To the right. - [Squire] No, the other oar. Hunter, stop rowing. Redruth, you, pull harder. - Yes sir. - Blast. - [Doctor] Don't worry, I'll get him. [rifle booming] - [Squire] Aim to the right, aim to the right. - Good work, Hunter. Good work, Redruth. - [Doctor] Put your backs into it, put your backs into it. - All together now. - Come on! - [Squire] Good job, lads. - [Smollett] All right, hold steady. I think we're out of pistol range. - [Squire] Oh no! [splashing] [cannon booming] [splashing in distance] - [Doctor] On the right, yes. Way on the left. Loosen your oars. [somber music] - The Jolly Roger! They must have taken the ship! They must have the Doctor and Squire as prisoner. - Now you get down, boy, they'll see you. - You don't have a boat, do you? I've got to get out to the Hispaniola. I've gotta try to save them. - I did build a wee coracle, but I-- - Can I borrow it? - You sure you wanna do this, boy? - I have to. Who knows what could happen to them? - You're a game 'un, Jim Hawkins, there's no mistake. All right. You just paddle it out and the current will sweep you right past the ship. - [Smollett] Well, what have we here? Must be the stockades Silver was talking about. Flint's men built it. - [Doctor] It's a wonder Silver's not here. - [Smollett] Well, he has better taste. - [Doctor] Still, it will serve our purpose admirably. [light music] - Better than nothing, I suppose. [tense music] [groaning] [bird squawking] [door creaking] [gasping] [glass shattering] - What's the matter, boy? You never seen blood before? What the hell are you doing here, boy? - [Jim] Get away from me! - Come here, you little brat! I'm gonna get you sonny Jim. [adventurous music] [Israel roaring] [bashing] [gasping] Why don't you climb, boy? I said climb. Go on. [chain clacking] Go on. Climb, cabin boy, go on. [bashing] [splashing] Why you little... [Jim screaming] Run for your life, cabin boy! - Jim, Jim! - I'm coming for you, cabin boy. [screaming] [thumping] [screaming] [thudding] [tense music] - What are you trying to do, boy? Hide the ship? You chose a good spot. Probably safe, hidden too behind those cliffs. And your friends, what of them? - Well they're not on there. - Yeah I saw men taking over the old stockade on the hill. Could be your Squire. He looks like a toff. Come on, I'll show you the way. [birds squawking] - It's plain what we have. We have a treasure map and we have ourselves some protection here. Before we go traipsing around this island battling with Silver's men, I'd like to know what's what. Everything's changed. I've lost my ship at least for the moment. But if you want me to help fight for this treasure you're gonna have to share it with me. - Well it's, it's just between us two and the boy. - Well the boy's gone. He's probably joined the pirates by now. Give me his share, I'll lead you. - [Squire] Well, Doctor? - [Doctor] Joined the pirates, he said? - After all, we don't even know whether he's alive or dead. - [Jim] But... - That's true. - Shh, careful boy, careful. - All right, Captain. The boy goes out, you come in. Equal shares, agreed? - I think you've just been cut out of the treasure. - What? - Come on. - They can't cut me out. - Let's have a look at this chart. - [Pirate] Where be that damn ship!? - [Pirate] Come on, ladies! - I can't believe it! I mean I found the chart. I had to fight Black Dog to keep it. I had to fight Israel Hands looking for them. - Yeah, yeah. Maybe you should keep your voice down, Jim. - I can't believe it, they cut me out. Just like that. - I'll take you to my camp but maybe just a little bit quiet will be a good idea. - They totally betrayed me! [groaning] let me go! - Not bloody likely! - Don't hurt the boy! - Let me go! - Shut your top, come on! Come on, up, up. - Look who we've got here. Young Jim Hawkins huh? Oh, and look who he's brought with him. It's old Ben Gunn [laughing]. Well Ben, I thought you were sailing with Blackbeard. How did you get here? - Marooned. Here on this island, John. - Aye. Did you find anything of interest? - No. No, nothing. - Well, we're all marooned here. Now, what about the ship. Do you know where it is? - No, sir. - Ah, the boy's lying, John. - What about the Squire and the Doctor. Do you know where they are? - Yes, sir. - Aye. They took over the stockade on top of the big chasm. - Right, let's get them! - Let go, boy! We're not going to attack. - Ah, great. So we do sweet Fanny Evans, huh? - No. No we're gonna trade for the map. - Trade 'em? - Aye. And if we, it won't cost us a drop of blood. - Yeah what have we got that they might want? - Plain and simple, George, you might have thought of it yourself. Being as you're so smart and that you'd want to be chief and all. Our hostage here. Young Jim Hawkins. [laughing] [snake hissing] Raise the flag higher. - Captain, Squire! - Who goes there? Stand or we fire. - Flag of truce! - And what do you want with your flag of truce? - Captain Silver, sir. We want to come aboard and make terms. - Captain Silver? Don't know him, who's he? - It's me, sir. The lad has chosen me Captain after your desertion, sir. - I have no interest in talking with you, Silver. But if you wish to speak then lay down your arms and come on in. [John groaning] Come on, we don't have all day. You're out of breath, Silver. You better sit down. - You're not going to take me inside? - Well if you stayed my ship's cook you'd be sitting pretty inside the galley. But if you gotta be Captain, Silver, common mutineer and pirate, you can go hang. - Aye. Very well then. But you just have to give me a hand up then. - Well man, if you've got something to say you'd better say it. - Aye. Indeed, Squire, to business. We want the treasure and we'll have it, that's the point. We have the boy, you want him and then we'll trade him for the chart. - The boy? We don't want the boy. In six months time he'll be sun dried and hanging from the gibbet in Tilbury like all the rest of you. - But he's one of you. - Not anymore, Silver. Now get on with it. Anything else to trade? If you had our ship we might trade for that. But you haven't, have you? - I'll be on my way. - Useless waste of a morning. I'll see you all to Davey Jones. - Could you give me a hand up now? - Not I. Go and get it. - Bloody bastard! Who's gonna help me up? Squire? Doctor? Ah. Bloody bastards. - Stay over there or risk being shot at. [somber music] - You heard what the Captain said, boy. - Fine then, shoot me! If someone can't help a man in need, then shoot me! - No, don't shoot! - For God's sake, man. - Blasted blighters! Come on, boy! Thank you, Jim, thank you lad! - See to the gate. - Oh. That's a fine tattoo, Jim. It's a sign, you know. Truly a gentleman of fortune like the rest of us, eh? - Gentleman of fortune? Doesn't that mean a pirate? - Ah, pirate Jim. Now the word's a tricky one. For instance here, now who would be the pirates? The men who worked their way across this treasure cruise and simply wanted their share of it or men like the Squire and the Captain who stole the treasure chart from a lad who was given it and then betrayed him out of his share of it. Now might they be the ones that should be called pirates? - Silver! The lads are getting a little nobbed about the way this happy holiday's shapin' up. So they've asked me to have a word. - Well if you want to speak then speak away. - All right. You've got us here, we've got nothing to show for it. No treasure, no ship. Just this blasted kid. With only you being a little bit too friendly for my liking considering he was meant to be an hostage. - And what of it? How long do I have to listen to you, to your drivel? Go fish. Or cut meat. - Morgan, give it him. - Ah. The black spot. I might have known. Now let's see what it says, huh? Ah, unopposed. And I thought as much. Very well, George Merry. Here. Take me Captains hat and make the best of it you can. I'll do as bid but I don't need to talk to you so I'll thank you to be on your way. - [chuckling] Come on. - Hah, there you go, Jim. There's a curiosity for you, see? That's the pirate way. Now, any man calls himself Captain can be voted out like they just did to me, and then vote in any man they want, even a fool. Like George Merry. Well, Jim, whatever happens now, thick or thin I'll stick by you, boy. You stood by me at the stockade and by thunder, I'll stand by you. [light music] [waves crashing] - It's a good idea. We have the guns, they dig it up, we relieve them of it. - Are you quite sure about this? - I'm the one he'll trust, if any. - [Redruth] Careful, sir. - [Squire] Thank you, Redruth. - [Doctor] Good luck. [men shouting] - Listen, are we gonna stand around growing old or attack that stockade and get the treasure map? - [Morgan] Attack today. - Right, well there's more of us than them, we'll do it now, come on. - Flag of truce! - Hold your fire. What do you want? - Squire Trelawney. Under a flag of truce to speak to Captain Silver. [men laughing] - Ain't no Captain Silver here. On the other hand if you want to speak to Captain Merry then come aboard. - We changed our minds. We'll accept your offer. We'll exchange the map in return for the boy. - You wanna give us the chart? - [Squire] Yes, if you give us back the boy. - You got it with you? Done, it's a deal. You can take him. Boy, you're free to go. - You're free, Jim. - I don't want to go! - What? - You sold me out once so I'll stay out! - Well in that case, I suppose the deal's off. I'll take the chart back. - No you won't, old man. We've done a deal. The boy's free to go. It just appears he doesn't want to. So you get the hell out of here before I filet you like a herring! [men laughing] [men chattering] - They don't want me back. I knew before you even took me there. It's just a trap. - Maybe, boy. But you'll not stop them now. [parrot squawking] - [Parrot] Pieces of eight, pieces of eight! - Captain Flint? [squawking] Where did you come from? Oh. That's a sign, boy, that's a good sign. That means we've still got our ship. And now. Now we've got to find ourselves some treasure. [laughing] [energetic music] [pirates chattering] [laughing] - Hey, check at us now, mate. Hey, you think you can do better? Here, you take it! - Come on, George. - Wait. Spyglass shore. Compass! Now there she lies, boys, there she lies! Come on! Come on, you bunch of blaggards! Come on! - [Doctor] Perfect. They're delirious with gold fever. - George! - Here's some bones for the pickings, Old John. All right, maybe it's an old salt by the look of his kit. - That's a good guess. I wouldn't like to find a bishop here, there was. - Why is he lying like that? - [Pirate] The boy is right, it's strange. - One of Flint's old jokes. He always was one to make a man squirm in his boots. Not unlike his cook. - Take a bearing, George. Along the line of them bones. - North by north northwest. - [John] What does the chart say? - Skeleton island. North by north northwest. - Well I reckon this is a marker. And that's our course. - Come on, come on! Yeah! [tense music] - They're off again. - Do you think they know what they're doing? - Who better to decide for the convolutions of a twisted pirate's mind than another twisted pirate? Come on. - [Morgan] Come on boys, come on! Nearly there! - I don't believe it. I don't believe it! Someone's already gone and done a runner with it! - [Doctor] Redruth, cover us from behind. - [Smollett] Squire, Redruth, all right. - [Squire] Thank you. [men chattering] - I was afraid of this. - Dig! Dig! [somber music] [men muttering] Idiot! Shut up! Dig! - Hey, any more of that, lad and you'd be walking home. What are you doing you useless swabs? There's nothing in there! Just get out! [tense music] [ominous music] - George! [gun firing] - I told you it was a trap! [guns firing] - Attack or retreat, Squire? - Attack, man, attack! [guns firing] - [George] Right, this is our time, boys! Walk to double time, guys! - [Ben] Run, Jim, run! [guns firing] [groaning] [bullets pinging] [screaming] [guns firing] [bullet pinging] - Agh! [thudding] - [Pirate] We need more powder! [gun firing] - Agh! [gun firing] [screaming] [gun firing] - Long John's all alone! I've gotta help him! [gun firing] [groaning] [heroic music] [grunting] [gun clacking] [guns firing] It won't fire! - Get down, boy, get down! [sword whooshing] [groaning] [guns firing] [groaning] - Ah! [chuckling] - Now that was a day's work, wasn't it? Both still in one piece? Whoah, we're in fine pickle now, nothing but dead bodies. No crew, no treasure, no ship. No enemy even. Oh, oh but what am I saying? What am I saying, we've got our lives, don't we? We've got our lives, don't we, Jim, aye. - You saved my life, Long John. I reckons I owes you some. - Some, some, some what? - Some of your name. Some silver, man. - You were the one who found the treasure? - I may not have had a map but I've had three long years to search for it. Hey come on, I'll show you. [chuckling] [light music] It took me a month to get in in here! - Ben Gunn, you are a marvel! - Hey, we'll split three ways. I found it, Jim's got a ship, and, - You do? - I sort of. I had it all along. - You are a son of a seadog! [laughing] - And we need a Captain. - Ack. Captain Long John Silver! I've always rather liked the ring of it. - Do you think if we could catch her off the bar she's on and get the booty aboard, the three of us could put up a sail or two and sail her over the Panama? - Yeah. I've never sailed the route as Captain but I've seen it sailed as cook. I reckon we could try. [all laughing] - Hey, we're free, mates! Fight's goddess! [laughing] - Shall we pull it up then? - Yeah eh, let's pull up on the, ah, aye, let's pull up the, what is that one called, Ben? - I don't remember, John. - Well, do I have to know the name then? Ah then let's just, let's just pull it up! Pull it up, brothers! Ah, here we go! [uplifting music] [light music] [birds squawking] [parrot squawking] [light music] [gentle music] [adventurous music] [ominous music] [somber music]
