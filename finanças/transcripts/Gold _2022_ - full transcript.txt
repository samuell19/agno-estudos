Joshimon! Joshimon! Sigh! Joshimon! Someone has parked a vehicle in front of the house. Huh... what? Someone has parked a vehicle in front of our house. - A vehicle? - Yes. Come. Look! What is it, son? Can't find anyone around either. That's what I said. Who left this here? Lift that tarpaulin and check what's in it. What's in there? Speaker? Who parked it over here? I'm wondering the same. He must have parked it here because we don't have a gate. Who? The one who parked the vehicle here. Who else? Let me... call the police station and file a complaint. Our car will be delivered today, right? That's right, son. Huh? There's a vehicle at this gate, as well? Do you like salted fruits? Yeah, I like it. I love it. My mom dips everything in salt water. Have you heard of Lololikka? - What's that? - Haven't you heard of Lololikka? - No. - Oh no! It's delicious! What was it called in English? - Oh yeah! Jangomas! - Hey! Sir! How do I get inside? It's round in shape. - It's really tasty. - I haven't eaten it. Hello! Sir! How do I get inside? The way is... Jump over. All of us jumped inside. Just jump! - I have to jump? - Yes. Jangomas! Also known as Lololikka. At some places, it has another name too. - What is it? - I want to file a complaint. Complaint? There's a guy named Rakesh Manjapra in there. - Rakesh...? - Rakesh Manjapra. - Manja...? - Manjapra. You can tell him. Okay? Well, Jangomas! Will you bring it from your home next time? Of course! I will bring plenty of them! This vehicle will be at the station for a couple more days, huh? Pull instead of push, huh? There's Mahogany and Wild Jack tree anyway. There's a lot of wood. I'm not buying any more wood. Please don't steal that wood, sir. What's your problem if I take two logs of wood? I have a problem! I have to show the records to the CI. Well, I'm taking two logs anyway! Emit that from your record! 'Morning, Sir! - Someone is here, sir. - I can see him too. Come. Come, be seated. I am serious, Rakesh. I will take two logs. I need to build some furniture at home. Don't add it to the record. Let him leave, sir.. Please don't... - Come. Sit, Brother. - Okay. Don't mind that. Sir, I am Joshi. In front of my house, someone parked a Bolero and vanished. A Bolero? That's interesting. The issue is that... ... my new car will be delivered today. Moreover, there's some work at my house since I'm about to get married. Oh, you're getting married? Which car are you buying? Well... it's a Polo GT. GT... Polo? So, only if this Bolero is shifted, I can... Oh! So, you can park your new car only if this one is shifted. Yes. Have you brought the complaint? Yes, Sir. Please read it. My eyes are not so sharp. Respected Sir, This morning, someone parked a Bolero in front of my house, without my permission. I request Kerala Police to move the Bolero from my front-yard. I mean... I humbly request! - Signed Joshi S. - Hey! Replace the "Sir" in it with "Circle Inspector". - I can email it, right? - Yes. Email is fine. You can ask him for the email address. Or... it's written over there. - Okay. - Got it? Send it today itself. - I'll send it right away. - We will come and check. I will take two logs! Please keep quiet! People will hear you! Oh! You're here? Do one thing. Get your bike. Someone left a Bolero in front of his house and went missing. Let's go there and check it. Sir... I have sent the email. Fine! - There's fuel in the bike, right? - Yes. Full tank! - Let me take the key. - Come. Hey... - Take the helmets as well. - Okay, Sir. - You can go ahead of us. - Okay. - Go ahead of us. - Okay. Check it quickly. Oh, we have to jump over the wall, right? - Hey, keep this cap inside. - Okay, Sir. - Are there two helmets? - Yes. - What? - Yes! - Sir, do you need help? - It's alright. I'm an expert in jumping over walls. - You can follow me, sir. - Okay. Go slowly. - Watch your head. - Okay. - Careful! - Okay, sir. The Mahogany has put us in trouble. Yes. This is the vehicle, Sir. The Bolero. I'm just parking my bike. I'll be right back. - Sir? - Yes. This one's loaded with speakers. Can I take one? What is this? Acting like small kids? Are you seeing speakers for the first time? No. I don't need the speaker. - You had been to the station, right? - Yes. Prince Sir needs the wood. I won't become like that, Sir. I... You aren't like that now. But you shouldn't become like that, later on. No. I won't become like that even in the future. - I won't repeat this. - Hmmm. What is it, Sir? Come back here. I came here to check that Bolero. CI Sir has arrived. - He reached? - Yes. He is creating a ruckus here. Come back quickly! Okay, Sir. Hey! The CI has reached the station. - Is that so? - Yes. Oops! I forgot to clean his coffee mug yesterday! The one in which he drank coffee yesterday? - Yes. - It must have become like curd by now! - Oh no! Let's go then. - Sir! What is it? It's a cover for the Mi Note 5 phone. I own a mobile phone shop... ... called "Smarty's". Is it? Where is the shop? At Sumangali Shopping Complex. - Which one? That old shopping complex? - Yes. Will you give me a discount if I come there? - Of course! - I will definitely come. Well... Let's go. CI has reached the station. So, I'll see him and come back. You wait here. We will be back soon. What about the Bolero? - The Bolero? - Let it stay there. Let it be here for the time being. We'll be back soon. Don't move it. Let it be there. Mom! The car has arrived. It has arrived? Yes. Our new car has arrived. Here I come! We can park this inside if you move the Bolero. It is not our Bolero. Someone else left it here. I have filed a complaint at the station. Coming, coming. - Okay then. - Thank you, Sir. Shall I get some tea for you? It's okay, Madam. We just had tea. - We need to meet other customers too. - Okay. Okay then, sir. - Okay, Sir. - Okay. - Let me go to the kitchen. - Sir... - Service is after one month, Sir. - Okay. You can come even when it crosses 1,000 km. I will come. - Okay, Sir. - Okay. The vehicle is parked exactly at the gate of their house. There's a gap just for one person to squeeze through. Is that so? Then do this. Let that Bolero be there, for the time being. Well, this Joshi has bought a new car, Sir. So, he won't be able to park it there unless we move the Bolero. It will be an inconvenience for him. Then do this. For now, just take that Bolero and park it on my chest! - Hey! - Yes, Joshi! Tell me, bro. I want to get a Bolero started. Can you come to my house? So, you bought a Bolero? And you didn't tell me! Do you remember our good old days? You used to bring your palm-wood bat to play cricket matches. - And I gave you my BDM bat. - BDM bat? Don't make me open my mouth! I am a stranger to you now, right? Tell me. You bugger! I didn't buy it! Oh, you didn't buy it? Whose is it then? Stop interrogating me and tell me whether you can come here or not! I'll be there. Just give me five minutes. Okay. Okay. Wasn't he the one who used to bring the palm-wood bat? I'm going for some urgent work. Will you fix this someday? - It will be ready by Monday. - Monday? - At what time? - We can give it by Tuesday 10 a.m. Oh... Huh? - Hey! - Hey. - You came so quickly? - Joshikutta! Come on! - This is the... - Whose car is this? This one... I... It's a new car I bought. I... I can't park it inside because this Bolero is here. That's why I asked you to come... - Hey... - Yes. When we went to watch Mammootty's "Black", I paid the money since you didn't have any. I climbed over the wall and got beaten up to see the film. Don't you remember that? - Of course! - I did all that for you, and you never bothered to let me know when you bought a car! - Dude, I... - At least, you could have consulted me about its mileage. What mileage will I get? You will get plenty. I was the one who taught you how to drive, right? - Yes. - And, to me... you never bothered asking anything! It's okay. "In big places, such small things keep happening" Don't speak like that, bro. I forgot about it in between my busy schedule. Tell me a way to park my car inside. We have to move this Bolero. You called me here when I have absolutely no time, to do this? You can move this inside and move that over here, right? You fool! Someone parked it here last night and left. There's no key, nothing! Tell me a way to move it. - So, you didn't buy this vehicle? - No. Then whose vehicle is it? Aargh! Don't drive me mad! Someone parked it here and left. I filed a complaint at the police station. With a broken down truck and forest timber, they can't even park a bicycle there, let alone a Bolero! What should I do now? File a case against the police! You check that Bolero. That's your job, right? - Don't get stressed, dude. - Okay. Where's the toolbox? It's over there, right? I too got stressed seeing your stress. Please come. Come. Hey, where is the key? What was I saying all this while? Oh! There's no key. That's the problem, right? I will fix it right away. - Hey Joshi. There's another problem. If at all its battery has been drained out, we will have to jump-start it. - What start? - Jump-start. Jump start means that we'll bring another battery... ... to charge this battery and then start the vehicle. What did you think? That we have to jump and start it? Yeah! You're not very familiar with auto-mobile terms, right? But you are familiar with mobile terms, right? - Yes. - This is the key socket. Keep it. Why are you giving this to me? You'll have to make a duplicate key with this. How am I going to make a duplicate key? You make one for me. I don't have time, dude. A car and a bus are still under repair in my workshop. I must return the bus tonight itself. It will be really late by the time I finish it. My kids are alone at home. I have to go and cook food for them. Oh! So, you are the one who cooks at your home? Yes. My kids prefer my cooking. I go to the river, catch a couple of fish, and make a curry with them. In case I get more fish, I fry them. This... This road leads to this house? Is there a way to go to the river bank? To the river bank? Through my house? Well, is there another way over there? I don't know about that. This is my house. Sorry. I lost the way. No problem. Always welcome. Okay? - Who was that? - Just a wanderer. Poor guy. Must have wandered away. So, won't you bring the key in the morning? I'll come here tomorrow morning with Velukkuttan. - He will fix the issue with the brakes. - Okay. By then, I'll get a duplicate key made, and we'll get this started. Okay. How much is it? I will send it on Google Pay. You can pay tomorrow. Let's see how much it costs and then decide. That's enough. - Okay then. - Okay. - So, see you tomorrow! - Okay. Sorry, dude. Joshimon! Yes, Mom! Hey JJ! Hey! Call our boss and ask him what we should do. Yes, yes. Call our boss. Just a second. Tell me, JJ. Boss, we're in front of the house where the Bolero is parked. Where should we bring this Bolero? You guys bring the Bolero... straight to... Straight to...? Straight to... Straight to...? Straight to... - Straight to...? Shall I ask them to bring it here? - Boss? Straight to...? What's the use in bringing it to the river? Come straight to... - Straight to...? - Huh? I can't think of a place, dude. Give me a moment. You bring the Bolero straight to... Straight to...? Come straight to the Vidya Raman school ground. - Okay. - That place doesn't have a gate, right? - There is no gate. Let's unload it there. - Okay. - If we unload it there... Where are you right now, Boss? I am at the river bank. Madhu is fishing here. - Just a minute. - Babykunju wants to tell you something. Boss, this is Babykunju. Tell me, Babykunju. What is it? Are there any other vehicles over there? Other vehicles... There are no other vehicles. Why? If we don't have any other vehicle, why should we take this vehicle to that ground? Oh! That's right. I didn't think about that. Hey! Are you smoking up over there? Yeah, dude. I got some great Marijuana. I got high even before smoking half of it. I am tripping on music here. Madhu is tripping on fishing here. You guys do this. Get tripping with that Bolero. Okay? What? Well... I said that in a flow. Sigh! Do one thing. Get the Bolero and head straight to... the school ground. Rest we'll decide over there. Okay? Okay then, Boss. Okay, Babykunju. Hope nothing goes wrong. Hey, I will start the Bolero. Hey, you don't have to start it. You've been with Boss for only two years, right? So? I've been with boss for five years now. So, I am the senior. I will start it. Give me the key. Babykunju! He will bring it, Faiz. Just come with us. Lower your voice. Speakers? - Speakers? - It's full of speakers. - Huh? - Yes, speakers. What is it? - Well... - What are you searching for? The thing in which we insert the key, is missing! Hotwire it with a spark and start the vehicle. What? Make a spark with the two wires and start the vehicle! Do you know how to do it? We are not thieves! We are goons! - Do you know how to do it? - I don't know. What can we do now? Do one thing. The two of you, push it from behind. - Push it? - Yes. Come. Come on. Shift to neutral gear. - It's already in neutral. - Come on, push! Push! Push harder! Push! What are you doing? Hey! Run for your life, dude! - Step out! - No. Come out! Run, Babykunju! He is crazy! Don't go. Hey, tell me what you came for... Hey! What did he do to you? Yes. I'd also like to know what happened there. - What happened? - I only remember being kicked, Boss. How about you? I got two punches on my nose at close range, Boss. I just remember getting punched in the face. That was one hell of a punch! I'll be right back after finishing him off! Bless me, Boss! - Will he be able to do it? - No way! All the best, my disciple! And before you go, make the payment for their injections and glucose. Sheesh! My dear Boss, I am raging with anger. Allow me to go, Boss. Let... let him go, Boss. His rage will die down when he gets a tight slap. I will go and finish him off with one kick. And I'll come back safely! My hands are itching, Boss. Control your rage, Madhu. Okay? Okay? Calm down, for the time being. Go and make the payment for the injections and glucose. Get back to your rage mode after that. My dear Boss, please don't give me boring tasks like paying bills. Let me go there, boss. You lazy bum! Loser, if I give you one tight slap, you will reach China! Go and pay the bill! Give me the money, Boss. Here you go. Hey... hey! - Take the prescription. - Okay, Boss. Hey, buy some fruits as well. Let me see. cheeks of the flower melodies of the past cheeks of the flower Huh? Shucks! What do I do now? That Bolero is full of speakers, right? What's wrong if I take one? I just have to pay the price of one speaker, right? I will ask for a parking fee! They have parked their vehicle in my front yard. Super Sound. Woah! This speaker is so damn heavy! Huh? There are no buttons? Is this a dummy? This is also a fraud job? These guys!! What is this?

He runs a mobile phone shop called Smarty's. - Nice to meet you, Chetta. - What? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. We'll take some time anyway. Go and ask your Mom to get me a cup of tea. By some time, you mean...? There's a lot of work. Go ahead. Would be great if I could get a bottle of water. Water... Tea? - Yes. - Huh? - Make it fast. - Why is he repeating what we said? Leave it. He is a good guy. - Mom! - Yes. Jomon wants some tea. - He needs some time to fix the Bolero. - I will bring it right away. There's a new mechanic with him. Velukkuttan. - He needs water. - Hey! - Give them these banana chips too. - Okay. - It needs to be more crispy. - Yeah, yeah! Water... and fresh banana chips. Phew! Did you get any clue about the Bolero's owner? No clue. I have told the police. They haven't said anything yet. The police station is full of forest timber, Velukkutta. Moreover, a truck broke down over there. No vehicles can go inside. So, the police have parked this Bolero on his chest, for now. Look, it's a call from the station. Those guys will have a long life! Yes. - Sir. - Joshi. Yes. Where are you? Are you near the vehicle? Yes. Tell me the vehicle number correctly, Joshi. Number... the one written on the number plate? Yes.

She's so skilled! - Yes, Sir? - Yes. - Joshi. - Yes. When I told the CI that the Bolero's number is wrong, he asked me to go and check it thoroughly. So, we might come there in the evening. Today evening? Huh? Well... Sir, I... Today evening I might... go to Wayanad... for two days. It will be a problem if you go to Wayanad for two days. We'll do something then. We'll come there right away. Right now? You will be there, right? Yes... I am here. We will come quickly. We'll be there in five minutes. - Jomon? - Yes. I... will go to the toilet and come back.

I was on the other side of the Bolero... under the banana tree. - Is that your new car? - Yes. - Nice! - Nice! KL- 8 AP... The number plate is fake. Oh. Boys, don't you have space in the station? - No, Chechi. - Oh. A truck is blocking our gate, Ammachi. Isn't that why we've asked Joshi to look after this vehicle? My son has bought a car and he's unable to park it inside. It's so sad! What a pity! Can't you understand his grief? We know that, Ammachi. But this forest timber and truck landed up at the station, all of a sudden. That's right. Shall I make some tea for you, boys? - I'll have one. - Huh? Well, I'll have one. Okay. I'll bring three cups of tea then. So, this is your new car, right? - Yes. - GT! Did you pay for it fully or did you take a loan? I paid Rs. 2 Lakhs. For the rest, I took a loan. - Is that so? - Is 2 Lakhs enough to buy a car? - We just need 2 Lakhs in hand? - Yes. Wow! In that case, I need to buy a car too. I am fed up of roaming around on the bike. It's a good car, sir. You should buy one. Shall I also buy one then? I mean, after two or three years. How much mileage do you get? Mileage... I can start driving it, only after taking it inside the house. - That's when I'll get an idea. - Oh, yeah! I got the Bolero repaired, sir. Let it be here, anyway. We'll take it to the station after the issue there gets solved. By the way, how big is this property, Joshi? It must be around 40-50 cents. 50 cents, right? Did you build the house or buy it? - It was built. My dad built it. - Is that so? - And there's the river... - Here's the tea. Call me if you need anything. I will be in the kitchen. Sir, tea for you. Wow! Great, cardamom flavoured tea! The tea is amazing! - Tell your mom that it's really good. - Don't forget to tell her. I'll tell her. - Sir! - What's happening? Did you check it? We checked it, Sir. There are no other issues. Should I send the bomb squad? Oh! We didn't check it in detail, Sir. Then what the hell have you gone to check? Check quickly and call me. I have to check, right? Okay, Sir. - I will check and call you. - Okay. We have to check whether the vehicle has a bomb. Oh no! Please move aside. - Sir, please hold this. - Keep it over there. Just pull that lever. Did you check there? And at the back? - Sir. - Yes, Rakesh. We checked it, sir. There are no issues. Then come back soon. I'm so agitated over here because of that bloody timber! The owner's calls, the Minister's calls, and the Police Chief's calls! I am going bonkers! We are coming, Sir. Okay, Sir. Okay. See you later. - Joshi Sir? - Tell me, Baazi. When are you coming to the shop? Well... I will try to come this week. Okay. What happened at the match-making ceremony?

I'll call you later. Okay. Thank God that the Police didn't find out! - Who is it? - This is Usman. How did it go? - Is everything loaded? - Yes, Sir. Come on! Come closer, Usman! What is it, sir? Do you know what you just loaded on to that vehicle? What is it? 99.9% Gold! So, it's not 100%? You duffer! There is nothing called 100%. 99.9% is what is known as... pure gold! Understood? Understood. When I'm saying that it's the best, he's asking stupid questions! - Sorry, sir. Forget it. Check your phone. This is an address, right? You have to take the Bolero to that address. Understood? Okay. - Okay then. Get going! - Okay. Hey, wait! If you do this job properly, I will gift a laptop to your son. Thanks a lot, sir. Okay. Go quickly. Okay, sir. Hello, Subha. - Hey... - Yes? Our daughter is saying that she doesn't want this alliance. Okay. Huh? what? You heard it right. She said that she didn't like that boy and his dad. Hey... I... I already sent them the gold they asked for, in a Bolero! Who is driving that vehicle? Is it Usman? Yes. Then call him back. Huh? Firstly, just listen to what I have to say, fully. I asked them to print the cards, after asking the two of you. I hired a chef who charges Rs. 9,000 per plate. I booked a fantastic convention centre with fully centralised AC. Porsche Panamera... I've booked two of them. One for the groom and one for our daughter. I've already spent many crores for all these, Subadhra! Are you dumbstruck now? Huh? I will... ... call you back. Namaste! Welcome to News365. My name is Durga Bhadradevi. Regarding the incident in which traces of opium was found in alcohol, the licences of 32 toddy shops in Muthalakkavu, might be suspensed... by the State Excise Commission. Well, it's not suspense, right? Might be suspensed! Huh...! What have you done? I can read only what you've written, right? My dear Suma... We've already booked the card, food and hall, right? How can we back out now? Did you book all these after checking with me? Why should we ask you anything about your wedding? We should do it ourselves, right? What am I saying and what are you saying? Won't your dad's reputation be ruined, if he changes his word after all this? You don't really love me, right? Why are you talking like that, dear? What is it, baby? Fine. Dad will come in some time. Let's try talking to him. Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Mom! - Hello Unni! - Hello. What's happening? I have sent it, brother. That's awesome! Cheers! Oh! You've started drinking, huh? During evenings, Idea Shaji will finish one full bottle! I have a couple of drinks... at night. Well, which drink are you having now? - Ichfiddinelg. - Ichfiddinelg? Just... Just send me 5 bottles of that. Why not? I will send it across. Awesome! Hey! When we came to your house to see your daughter, didn't you mention a shopping complex? Sumangali shopping complex. Yes, that's it. You should write it in my son Sunesh's name before the wedding itself. Of course! Consider it done! Oh! So be it. Just hand over your "Sumangali Jewellers" shop also to me! I will accept it. Oh, no. I can't give that. Why? I am thriving because of that. You can ask me anything except that. Then... I will discuss with my son and call you back. There's a long life ahead of us, right? You needn't tell me now. Take your own time and tell me after the wedding. We shouldn't be delaying such things. I will call you back, right away. Okay? As you wish! Okay! I've run out of liquor. What do I do now? Well, I just have to mix some water, right? Dear God! Shall I ask for five trucks? Or, forget that. I will ask for a resort. Oh yeah! - Can you give me some more mixture? - Why not? Radha, give some mixture to Uncle. This mixture is really tasty. - Only some bakeries serve this. You don't want anything else? Yes. I have to drink tea as well, right? How about you, Mom? You can give me a Mysore Pak, dear. Mysore Pak? You are diabetic, right? - Are you diabetic? - Yes. This is only once in a while, right? It's alright. Someone is calling you. Shall I... answer this call? - Usman. - Yes. - You wait here. - Okay. - I'll be back soon. - Okay, Sir. Are you buying this phone for educational purposes? Yes, Chetta. - And we need to make Reels too. - You make Reels? Great! The best one for that is... Mission Possible! What about this one, Chetta? Redmi? Actually, Redmi is good. - Good camera, good sound... - How about the rate? Rate is not an issue. I can give you a discount. Don't worry about that. So, let's choose Redmi. Good for studies, and to make Reels too. - Okay? - Yes. Shall I pack it? - Yes. - Hey, you! Didn't I tell you all to pack everything and leave? Then what happened? I don't see any change here! Leave now! - We'll come later. No problem. - Please don't leave. Just a minute. There is a problem! This shop won't be here from tomorrow onwards. Get going! Just a minute! I will pack it right away. - No, it's okay. - I've been telling him for so many days! - Okay then. - Playing tricks with me? Hey! Who are you? A king? Monarchy is a thing of the past! Didn't we call inform you that the security here is bad? How many times did Joshi Sir tell you that we don't have a toilet here? You're charging a sum for maintenance, right? Are you doing any maintenance? Have you ever bothered about us, even once? - I don't care! - Huh? I don't have to prove anything to you! Listen! I will give you one week's time. It's my daughter's wedding in two weeks. Do you know that? - Nothing will happen! - Huh? - Nothing will happen! - Oh! - Call Joshi Sir if you want us to vacate! - Tell him! - I will call him! - You want a phone? - No! I have a phone. - Call him! - I will call him! You've built a worthless building without water or light! Can't reach him? COVID message! - You are even worse! - I know that! - Hello? - Hello. - Hello? - Hello! - Hello! - Joshi, right? This is Unnikrishnan. Tell me, Sir. Mr.Joshi, I had asked you to vacate this shop, right? Listen... I'll give you one more week. You must clear all your garbage from here, and return the shop to me in the same condition that I gave you. How can you say that? Where will I go taking all my stuff, on such short notice? That's none of my concern, Mister. I'll go to court then. You can go to the court or to the police or anywhere you want to. I don't want to know about it. I need my shop back. I will give you one week's time. Okay? - Yeah! - Hello? I am here for this function... I would have ripped him apart otherwise. - I'll get you later. - Yeah, come and get us! - Yes, I will. You should be here. - I will be here. I'll come and get my shop back! You don't know me! Who do you think you're messing with? - Get lost! Who do you think you are? - Joshi owns a mobile phone shop. - Oh, okay. - There's a "Smart" in smartphone, right? - Yes. So, he has named his shop as "Smarty's". Bro, what's the latest Android phone in the market? Which car do you own, Joshi? Car... It's GT... Polo. It will come soon. I have booked one. - Yes, yes. - It will come! 17 x 6 = 102 Two layers of 102 pieces would make it 204 pieces. Four pieces short at the edge. So, it will be 200 pieces. 200 speakers! - Mom! - Yes. What will we do if we get a treasure one day? Son, everyone is not fortunate to chance upon a treasure. Only the lucky ones will be able to get a treasure. If you get a treasure, use it wisely. No one gets a treasure on a daily basis. The one who is lucky, gets the treasure. Well, what if we get a treasure, one fine morning? What you get one fine morning, is not a treasure. That's your destiny. You must be careful and wise while using it. Get going! I'm making some banana fritters here. Don't make me lose my concentration, son. What are you searching for? Well, we had a small weighing machine here, right? - Where is it? - Is that all? You could have asked me. - Here you go! - I didn't see it when I checked. Your focus is elsewhere. That's why. Listen. Taking the weighing machine is fine. But return it as it is. Of course! One kilo. Super Sound... SS Mini... Speaker cost... So, for 200 speakers... 8990... multiplied by... 200. If I could get some dynamite, we can blow up this entire complex! We should blow this up just like how they blew up the flats in Maradu. Wait till we get all this registered in our name. I will buy you a truck load of dynamite! - One load won't be sufficient, Dada. - Then make it two loads. I'll have a blast then! Listen. The visuals of blowing up this complex using the dynamite... Boom... boom... boom! Those explosive visuals... should be aired live in TV, social media and radio! Watching all that, let the entire public have goosebumps seeing the ideas of this Idea Shaji! Ha...Ha...Ha! Sir, are you going to demolish this shopping complex? Yes. I bought this complex. I am Idea Shaji. This is my son, Sunesh Shaji. We're going to blow up this complex, next month. What's the matter? I was thinking of getting my daughter married. No way! After my wife died, I raised him on my own and brought him to this level. I can never imagine having another life partner. Dada! Well, I am planning to get my daughter married. There's a guy who runs a shop in this shopping complex. He is the prospective groom. In that case, find some other better guy for your daughter. Next month, we will blow this up! Only some dust would remain here, then. Haha... Haha! I will blow this up! I will blow this up! I will blow this up! My dear brother, the shop can exist only if the complex exists, right? What's going to come up here, are shops of international brands alone! Listen! We won't allow worthless local shops to function here. - Okay then. You may leave. - Let's go. Okay, bye. Manjappetti. I'm not going to answer your phone, my dear! Ignore! My son, just try eating it with some more tamarind chutney. It's so tasty! Mom! Do you want some buttermilk? Yes. - Hey! - Yes. Stop looking at that and give her a call! Ah! What do I speak to her? Start a conversation regarding that shopping complex. And then, ask her whether her Dad is in the house. Oh, yeah! I haven't shared that with her! - Shall I call her? - Yeah! Nuisance! Suma! What are you doing? I am just sitting idle. Tell her! I've called to share a small idea with you. What idea? You know... our Sumangali shopping complex, right? It's really old now. Let's blow it up using dynamite... and build a new luxurious shopping complex? Why? Well, I keep getting such ideas all the time. Anything else? Yes, I have many other ideas too. I wasn't asking whether you have other ideas. I was asking whether you have anything else to talk. - Isn't your father home, Sumangali? - No. Where did he go? Well... They... They? - They... - They...? They...? T-T-They... They have gone jogging! At this hour? They are like that. Good. Nice couple! Okay then, Suma. I will call you later, okay? - Good night. Sweet dreams! - Okay. You guys sit here and laugh! Him and his dumb ideas! When will I be able to park you inside? Oh no! Oh my God! Get lost, you brute! I knew that you'll run away! Three guys came last night and got beaten up. And a new guy today! Who are they to keep coming daily? A soap opera? - Come here. - What? Come here! Did you just smoke? Me... err... smoke... why... I? Huh? Blow! Not like that. Blow towards this side. This side! You're crossing the limits these days. - Good night, Mom! - Yeah, yeah! Good night! Oh God! Will we have to take him to a better hospital? Oh no! No... I guess. Peel an orange and give it to him. I'm unable to bear this! Me too! Oh no! Madhu, how were you planning to kick him? Don't beat a dead horse, dude! We can mock him gradually. Let him get up first. When is he going to get up? - Boss! - Huh? What is it, dear? Boss...? Oh! He's asking you to go and get the Bolero, boss. Me? No way! It will be a problem if the cops find out that I'm involved. Understood? It will be a problem. But do we ever let the police know when we do a job? Yes, that's very rare. - What's happening here? - We'll see. Get up! All of you get up! Go back to your respective beds! Hey Babykunju! - You go there. - Didn't you hear me? You get up first. - Get up, I say! - But I... Go and stand outside! - What's that, dear? - Hey! Boss! How are you feeling now? We only got two glucose bottles. - I'll tell the doctor when he comes today. Don't talk too much! - What? - He had four glucose bottles! He's not boozing, to keep a tab! the music of the birds? Wake up - Son. - Yes. Crush and mix these two pappadoms in it... and eat it with chickpeas curry. - Really? - Yes. Okay then. Hello? - Hello. - Is it Nakshathra Jewellers? Yes, Sir. Do you have a gold furnace over there? I didn't get you. There's a machine that's used for melting gold, right? Do you sell it there? No, sir. We have only jewellery here. We don't have a gold furnace. - Oh, okay. Thank you. - Okay, Sir. - Hello? - Hello. Err... is this Rathnam Jewellers? Yes, this is Rathnam Jewellers. Do you have a gold furnace for sale there? What? The machine used for melting gold. Do you have it on sale there? No, no. Do you know where I can get one? Just Google it. The shop is really crowded now. Huh? Why are you getting angry, bro? Ah! Thank you. Is there anyone who works at a jewellery shop? Oh yeah! Anto Chettan! I should have called him first! That's Joshi, huh? Why is he calling at this hour? No matter who calls! I'm not going to answer! I am going to die anyway, right? Let me switch off the phone before dying. Random guys will keep calling to disturb me. They won't allow me to live or to die! Huh? He disconnected the call? Sheesh! Anyway, it's the last call, right? Let me attend it. - Hello? - Anto Chetta! Hello? Are you free now? I am at work now. I will be free after some time. What's the matter, Joshi? Well, do you know where I can get a machine that melts gold? You mean, "Moosha"? Moosha? Yes... Moosha. In English, it is called gold furnace. That's the one, right? Yes, yes. That's it. If you need a relatively new one, I've got one. - Huh? - I have it here with me. Is it so? Do you want it now? Do you want to take it now? Of course! I want it for sure! Hello, Anto Chetta! - So, the furnace? - Have you brought money? Money... Google Pay....? - Yes, I have it. - Okay. Well, how much do you need? A new one costs only Rs. 30,000. - This one is also brand new, Joshi. - Is it so? - I have used it only 4-5 times. - Okay. And as you know, my shop has been shut for a while. So, no one comes here now. - That's why I chose to sell it. - Okay. So, how much do you need, Chetta? - Let us not bargain, Joshi. - Okay, let us not. Give me Rs. 10,000. Rs. 10,000. - Okay! - Huh? 10,000 is okay! Okay! Yes. You must have got it now, Chetta. Yes! Meesha... Moosha... Machine... Chetta! Chetta! Chechi, five pieces of Puttu and two chickpeas curries, please. - Shall I go? - Okay! Cover the Puttu. Joshi, I'll be right back. - Let me give this food to them. - Well, the furnace...? Hey Alice! Kids! Come on! Come on! Have some Puttu and chickpeas curry. Come on! - Hey! Come here! - From where did you get this now? - Don't ask! Just serve it quickly. - Sit down, kids. Eat well, okay? Dad will be right back. Eat until your tummies are full. Come on, eat it. - Get me "Gems" chocolate, Dad. - Huh? - I need a "Munch". - I'll buy it! Keep it in your car. You can let go, Chetta. I will bring the tools. Okay. Here you go, Joshi. These are the tools. Thank you, Chetta! - Oops. - Did it get locked? It has an automatic lock. It's my new car. By the way, you have to be very careful while using it. When the gold has melted well, hold the handle using gloves. You should pour it only after that. Understood? Correct, right? Original! 99.9%... okay? - Shall I make the call? - Yes. - Hello, Anto. - Hey, Mustafa. - Yes. - Well... I have 1 kg original gold. Do you need it? Of course, I need it. Smuggling is not happening these days. Okay. But they need the money today itself. Just tell me when you need it. But I need the gold today itself. I've got some wedding orders. Should I come there with the party or should I come alone? Don't you know where our warehouse is? Yes, I know that. Or forget it. There are CCTV cameras there. Why do you need to be so stressed? We're not smuggling, right? I didn't mean that. Do one thing. Well... there's that bridge near that old bungalow, right? You come here, Mustafa. Come to my house. It's safe here. Police won't come here. Okay then. I'll come to your house with the money. - Come right away. - Okay. Okay... okay. He's very punctual. Sharp on time. - How are things? Are you fine? - I am fine. - So, here you go! - Okay. - I did a scratch test. - Okay. - 99.9%. - It's okay, right? Pure stuff! Of course! - Is this the seller? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. I am Gold Mustafa. - I am Gold... Errr... - Huh? Just Joshi. - So, let me just... - Okay. - Money? - Huh? - Money? - He is bringing it. - Here's the full amount. - Okay. - Here. - Shouldn't I count it? Not necessary. I counted it using a machine. - You needn't waste time. - That will be correct. So... okay then. Well, if you have any more gold, you can give it to me. Yeah, I can give more gold. Where did you get so much gold from? Just take the golden egg, Mustafa Ikka. Why do you want to see the goose that lays it? - Yes. - I just asked. That's all. - Okay then, Shaji! - Okay. - It's Joshi. - Okay Joshi. Bye Anto. - Don't forget about the gold. I am? - Gold Mustafa! - Okay then. - Okay. - Hello, Joshi. - Yes, Chetta. - Are you free now? - Yes. Are you somewhere outside? No, tell me. It's fine. Well... they had called. They said that they are not interested in this alliance. The reason they told me was that, when the girl's dad and some relative of theirs... went to the shopping complex to enquire, someone over there told them that... they bought the complex. And like the apartments in Maradu, they are going to demolish it using "dynamatic"! Demolish it with dynamite? Yes, Joshi. Listen... That's what they told me. They said that, if this is the situation of the shopping complex, what will be the situation of the shop owners? That's what the girl's dad asked me when he called. Chetta, before moving to that mall, my Smarty's shop was an independent shop, right? If the mall is gone, I will move my shop elsewhere. Why didn't you say that? Well, they've received another proposal from somewhere else. I realized that from the way he spoke to me. Okay. We'll get only what's meant for us, right? He disconnected the call saying that... some other prospective groom is coming to see her tomorrow. Don't be worried just because they dropped the alliance. I am getting some other calls. Don't worry. I'll find a better alliance for you. Stop! Stop! - Johny Sir! - Check it. Where are you going? I am going home. - Do you have your driver's licence? - Yes. Show it. - It's a new car, right? - Yes, it's a new car. What's in that bag? - In the bag... err... it's dirty clothes. - Okay. What is it, Johny? He's saying that the bag has dirty clothes. Okay. Let him go. - Okay. You may leave. - Okay. - Hello? - Hello. Isn't this GK Speakers? The shop is closed now. Err.. Hello? Hello? Hello. Isn't this Sound Hub? The shop is closed now. Sorry, Sir. No... wait! Just a minute! I... I need.... I need speakers from the brand, Super Sound. The small one. Oh no! It's closing time now, sir. How many pieces do you need? That's the matter. I need 200 speakers. - 200 speakers? - Yes. Here... Can you please hold on for a minute, sir? Yeah, okay. Hey, check how many SS Mini speakers we have in stock. Which model? - The small one... Mini. - Small one? - Is this the one? - Yes. Just a minute. Let me check. Where is your shop located, sir? My... shop? Errr... Kannur. It's in Kannur. Oh! What's your name, sir? My name... Joshi. Joshi, right? Okay. It will be difficult to deliver it to Kannur. No. You needn't deliver it to Kannur. I can take it from Aluva. That's fine? Then it is okay. - Chetta... Chetta! - Yes. We have 20 pieces of the Mini speaker. - 20 pieces? - Yes. But we have 50 pieces of the Classio speaker. There's a small problem, sir. We have only 20 pieces of the Mini speaker. - Oh no! - Classio... Classio... But we can give you 50 Classio speakers. The big one. I can give 50 pieces of that one. No, no. I need the small speaker from SS. - SS Mini? - Mini. SS Mini. I need 200 pieces of that one itself. Okay, okay. No problem. Just tell me your address, sir. I will arrange it by day after tomorrow. Day after tomorrow... won't be enough. I need it by tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, right? Okay, Sir. I will arrange it by tomorrow morning, somehow. Okay. Do you have GPay? Oh no! Would be great if you could pay us in cash, sir. Cash... Okay. I can give you cash. I can pay in cash. I will send my address on WhatsApp. I'll pay the cash when you make the delivery tomorrow morning. That is okay, sir. Okay. So, won't you deliver it tomorrow morning itself? Yes. Tomorrow morning. I will call you, okay? - Thank you, Sir. Good night. - Okay. Which model is it, Chetta? - SS Mini. - This one? Pack 20 pieces of that one. We had 50 pieces of this one. You could have given it. He needs SS Mini specifically. Where is the delivery? He will send the address. Pack those pieces. Let me see. - Okay, I will pack those pieces. - Okay. - What is it? - Sir... - I've repaired the truck. - Is it done? - Yes. Okay. CI is calling you. Go. - The payment...? - Payment? - What is he saying? - I don't know. We will send it later. - Sir? - Yes. We have money with us, right? If you have the money, you pay it. Call your boss quickly and tell him what happened. He had offered to buy a laptop for your son, right? Yes, he did. You've been with him for 8-10 years now, right? He must be stressed and his BP must have shot up by now. Call him and tell him what exactly happened. - I'll call him, right? - Call him. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. What happened to the gold? It hasn't reached here yet. Well... that... There's a slight technical glitch. You had promised to send 5 bottles of Ichfiddinelg here. Can you at least send those quickly? I will send those today itself, if possible. Well, what about our shopping complex deal? Oh no! The moment you told me, I had given orders... to everyone at the complex to vacate their shops. - Oh. - But... There's a guy named Joshi. He's the owner of a mobile phone shop called "Smarty's". It will all be clear if he also vacates his shop. Smarty's... Nutties... Amul cheese... Whatever it is, I will evict the shop right away! No, no! Don't do anything like that! - Why? - It will become a problem for us. - Stop it! - If he gets a stay order from court... What court? All our deals will be done for. Got it? It is Idea Shaji on this side, Unni. I already got five ideas just now. I just have to apply one of them, not just Joshi... even Koshi will vacate! Who is that? Koshi? Aargh! I just said that to get a rhyming effect, my dear Unni! - His number is busy. - Great! I will call you right back, Shaji. I am getting an urgent call. Single malt! Ichfiddinelg! Sunee, my Son! I am too stressed out! I feel like going to the toilet after drinking your tea! If you drink good tea, your stomach will be cleared immediately. He is calling back. - Hello. - Good morning, Sir. Good morning? Where were you all these days, Usman? I could not deliver the Bolero to the address you gave me. I understood that when you switched off the phone. Well, sir... I went that night with that Bolero, right? A team of goons attacked me, sir. Team of goons? Huh? Yes. I was taking a turn in that Bolero. All of a sudden, an iron rod flew by, right in front of me. Sheesh! You missed it! When I looked to the left, I saw ten goons. They had come to attack me, sir. Someone somehow got the news that we were delivering gold. - From where did it get leaked? - I don't know that, sir. I fell sick and had fever out of fear, sir. Will it be a problem? Well, I became okay when I had Dolo 650 tablets, sir. I'm not talking about your fever! I'm asking whether we'll be in trouble. No, sir. We won't be in any trouble. Where is the Bolero now? I've parked it inside a vacant house. Do you remember the house? I remember the house very well. Then, come quickly. Let us go to that house. I'll come after going to the toilet, and taking a bath. No need for all that. Just come here quickly. Well, I am sweaty and smelly, sir. We have to go in an AC car, right? Okay, okay. Make it fast. Okay. I will come quickly. - Auto...? - 2000 Rupees. Rs. 2,000? Yes, Chetta. Rs. 2,000. - Woah! - I'll reduce Rs. 100 for you. So kind of you! Here you go. Here's Rs. 1.50 Lakhs. Oh okay. - Sir, the auto rickshaw fare? - I will give it. Wow! Perfect! - Here you go. - 100 Rupees? It's okay. You can keep it. Okay. Thank you, Chetta! - You...! - Oh my God! Why can't you answer the phone when I call you? I was on leave, Sir. I've been jumping over the wall like a thief to enter the station, for the past 3 days, just because of you. Can't take out the jeep parked inside! Can't move in the jeep parked outside! I am warning you. If you don't move that truck and timber immediately... - I will move it, Sir. - You heard me, right? Sir! Sir... Sir! Haven't you left yet? Your baton, sir. Keep it here and go move those. Sir! Come on, start the truck! Move aside, Chetta. No. It's evidence. Oh! It weighs four times more than the original. The speaker has a "Super Sound" sticker. And on the gold, it says "Genuine Original". They have changed only the speaker and the sticker. Wonder whose idea it was! - Sunee, my dear! - Yes. I had called Unni. - Did he answer the call? - Yes, he did. I asked him about that shopping complex. When will he vacate it? The moment I asked him, he made everyone get out. But there's a mobile phone shop. It is owned by a loser. Called "Notice" or "Watis" or something. As soon as that last shop is evicted, the shopping complex will be ours! What about the gold? Is it coming soon? No. There's some technical glitch, it seems. But... the Ichfiddinelg will reach right away! We have sufficient soda and ice, right? Hey, why did you stop? Let some more fat get burnt! I have burned enough for today. Sheesh! If the gold was here, I could have booked a Lamborghini Urus. You do this then. Give that Porsche Panorama to me. My dear Dada! - It's not Panorama or Manorama! - Then? - Panamera. - What? - Panamera. - Whatever it is, it's Porsche, right? You do whatever you want with it, Dada! Hey, forget all that. That mobile shop. What was its name? Sporty's? Ah yes, Smarty's! Hey! We need to get it evicted somehow. If we go, we will get into trouble. Why so? My dear Dada, there will be CCTV cameras there, right? We can be identified, right? Let's get someone else to do it. Oh! You are indeed my son. That's a great idea! That's enough. Bring in some guys, Dada. Hey! They will ask for a lot of money. Tell them that it's a simple job, Dada. Okay. It's not the entire shopping complex. - Just one shop has to be cleared, right? - That's it. - Shall I call the guys in Thammanam? - Thammanam? Call some new gen boys, Dada. But I don't know anyone like that. - I know a guy. Shall I call him? - Okay. Will he just sit and smoke up or will he get it done? They are not like that. They are awesome new gen goons. Wait and watch, Dada! They will rock. New gen goons? I am calling them, okay? - Hello? - Hello Manu. Tell me, Suneesh Chetta. Hey, I have a small hitjob. What? Which pig has ordered a hitjob against you? Hey! I mean, it's a hitjob for you. What is this, Chetta? What issue do we have, for you to give a hitjob against me? Manu, don't talk nonsense! Listen carefully to what I have to say! Well, there is a shopping complex. I need you to evict a shop there. Oh, okay. Talk "cleerly" like that. Hey, it's just a small job. It will cost you 5 lakhs, minimum. That's not an issue. I will give you 10 lakhs. Is that so? Give me the details then. It's inside a shopping complex. You need to evict a small shop there. That's all? That can be done. It's simple. Give me the money. I will do it right away. Not a problem. I will send it right away. Don't send it. I will come there and collect it instead. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. It was Suneesh Chettan. He said 10 lakhs. We need to get a shop evicted. Is it a hitjob? Yeah, just a minor hitjob. - Manu! - Suneesh Chetta! Hey! - That's a nice car! - Isn't it? - Do you want it, Chetta? - No. - I can give you a good deal. - I will get a Panamera soon. - Is it? - I've booked a sports SUV as well. - Which one? - Lamborghini Urus! - Oh my God! Urus? - Yes. I will come to click a selfie. Okay? Just get that shop evicted somehow. You can click two selfies after that! Consider it done. Is that the money? Just a second. - Keep the cash inside the car. - Okay. This is my partner. - Hello. - Hey man. - Shall we leave then? - Okay. - Bye then. - Okay then. Hello? Isn't this Jumper Santhosh Chettan? Yes. Who is this? Boss... Freddy... I am calling on behalf of Boss Freddy. On behalf of Boss Freddy? What is the matter? Tell me. There's a hitjob, Chetta. Hmm. What is it? You need to get a small shop evicted. My rate is quite high. It's Rs. 1 Lakh. Will that be a problem? One lakh? One lakh is okay. It is okay. Then you come straight to... Parunthu Ranchi Manappuram. We have a car, Chetta. Shall we come there? Cars and trucks can't reach this place. Just come to Usman riverbank. I will come there in my speed-boat. Okay then, Chetta. Let us meet at Usman riverbank. Okay. Get the car quickly, Usman. And take me to the Bolero. Oops, the mask! Suma! Dear! Yes, I am coming. - Did you take your mask? - Yes, Dad. Make it fast, man! Come on! Go quickly! Take me to the opposite side. I don't usually take up such jobs. But since it's Freddy Boss' recommendation... Okay, thanks. What do you want me to evict? It is a shop. A shop? It's a small shop inside a complex. - Is it the whole complex or just a shop? - No, no! - Just one shop. - Just a small shop. - Just one shop? - It is called Smarty's. Okay. - One shop is simple. - Okay. I'll go tomorrow evening and evict the shop. I'll call you after that. You should come here then. - Okay. - Okay? Get down. - Call us when you're done, Chetta. - Okay. Can you move it forward, Chetta? - Jump! - Jump! Jump! You should come when I call you tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay, boss! Hello? What are you doing? Get going! Get lost! Go, go! You were here, Joshi? When did you return from Wayanad? - Wayanad? - When did you return from Wayanad? From Wayanad... I went... I came back. Well, I did a test drive of the Polo GT. But I've asked them to bring two other cars as well. - I have to drive all those and decide. - Yes. - Greetings, Mom. - You two have come back? - Good morning. - What would you like to drink? - To drink...? - Can we get that cardamom tea? Okay, okay. I'll get some Vadas and chutney too. Oh! That will be great! I am hungry. That's why. Can you do me a favour, bro? It's out of charge. Can you please charge this phone? This is a really old model, sir. If you come to Smarty's, I will show you some awesome new models. I keep planning to buy one every month. But my salary doesn't even cover my dad's hospital expenses. He's an alcoholic. He doesn't have a liver. Forget it. Well, if he has a liver problem, the stonebreaker herb is perfect. Stonebreaker? What's that? Dude, stone... What kind of a policeman are you? Don't you know what stonebreaker is? - Here's our Bolero, sir. - I saw it. You wait here. Let me go and check. I have heard of gooseberries. What is this? Stonebreaker. Dude, it's stonebreaker! - Stonebreaker. - Yes! Okay, okay. If your liver is damaged due to excessive drinking, crush it and drink it. You will be cured. You must come to my shop, sir. - I will get this sorted. - I will definitely come. Don't you know what stonebreaker is? I haven't heard about it. - Really? - Yes. I thought you were kidding. - No! I haven't heard of it. - Police! Police! Police! Police! - Police? - Police! Police! - Start the car! - What is it, Sir? - Police! Police! - Start the car, Usman! - Sorry... Usman Chetta! - Start the car! - What is it, Sir? - Police! Police! Check the wall! The wall is good! Be careful, Dad! You would've been pasted on the wall now. Come on! Move! It must be there in the south. - Come on, move! - Drive quickly, Usman Chetta! Get in, dear! - Get in, dear! Don't let them see you! - I am coming! Come on! Move! Move! Teak wood is really expensive now. - Come fast! - Go fast! Come fast! Move... move... move! Where is this Joshi? Dad! Get in the car! Get in! Come on! Come on! Come fast! Stop... stop! Let me get in! - Will you get in, Dad? - Get in now. Quick! Start the car! Reverse the car quickly, Usman Chetta! Come on, drive! Police! Police! Don't hit the wall! Don't hit the wall! Come on! Fast! Come on, drive quickly! Didn't you tell me that it's a vacant house, Usman? No one was there at night. We'll go and check after some time, if the cops have left. When will the cops leave, Sir? I don't know. How will I know? All the tyres are really good. It it was in our station, someone would have stolen these tyres. Sir! Oh, you're back? They've started smuggling gold in such vehicles now. - Is that so? - Of course! Recently, I seized some laptops. In those laptops... Look at me! And they had replaced the laptop's hard disk with gold. - Have you handled such cases, sir? - Of course! When the case went to court, they were easily acquitted. So, I'm not interested in such cases any more. Recently, I... Hey, listen. Recently, I seized some printers. Inside the printers, it was gold. - Gold? - Yes, gold! There were 25 printers. The count became 20 when it reached the court! So, I don't take too much effort, because there's no point in working hard. Yes. They get off the hook easily. It's pointless. I just want to retire somehow. That doesn't mean that you... ... should learn from Prince Sir! No... never! - Bluetooth speaker. - Those are speakers! Genuine original. It's really heavy. Weight... well... Here's the tea, son. The tea is here! Here's the tea. I will bring the Vada now. Okay? Okay. Here you go. What should I do with 2 cups? Do you need 2 cups, sir? No. Take one. And one more thing! I forgot to tell you the good news, Joshi. Ah yes! Tomorrow evening, we will take this vehicle from here. - Hello? - Yes, Subhadra. What? We saw the Bolero. But there are cops near it. So, we've moved away from there. Be careful, Unniyetta! Okay. If I tell you something, don't get stressed. What happened? - Did anyone call from the card company? - Not that. Then... food, hall... any of those guys? No. Then what's the matter? - I searched all the rooms. - What? - I tried calling too! - What? Our Suma is missing! What? She is with me in the car, Subhadra. I'll put her on. Phew! She got me stressed for no reason! Hello, Mom! You scared me, dear! I am with dad here. Sigh! I got so stressed that I even had gas trouble! I forgot to inform you while leaving. Don't get stressed, Mom. Hey! Once the cops leave, we will go and check and then call you. - Be careful, Unniyetta. - Okay. And... don't get caught. Okay. Hey! The groom's dad is calling. I will call you later. - Okay. - Okay. Hello? - Hey! - Hello? You have been beating around the bush for a while now. Can we trust you? Will you deliver the gold here, at least today? I'll sort everything out today, Chettayi. You won't do squat! Don't mess with me. Hey! Mind your words! What will you do if I don't? - You lying bragger! - What? Listening to you, without sending the gold as it is, I moulded it in the shape of a speaker, painted it blue, designed a cover, printed it, packed the speaker inside a cover and sent it to your house in a Bolero! And you are calling me a bragger? Hey, Idea Shaji's ideas are always unique! It will be bitter first. But later, it will turn out to be sweet. Why? Are you a gooseberry? No, I am a gooseberry tree! You're getting on my nerves! I could have delivered all that gold as biscuits to your house easily, at the specified time itself. You and your stupid idea! Yeah, you would have done sh*t! Hey, did you at least deliver that Hciddifnelg? Just one one good deed happened, while dealing with you. I got some cash. If you want, I'll return it to you right away! Dada, what are you saying? Hey, you are greedy as hell! Yes, I am super greedy. As if you are a sage! Hey bugger, I told you to transfer that ugly shopping complex to my name. Did you do that till now? I won't do it. You can sue me! I've realized your tricks. He must have given it as collateral to some bank. I didn't understand. I've got such a useless son! - Hello? - He must have... mortgaged that shopping complex at some bank. Hello? Hello? I've taken a decision now. I won't get my daughter married to your son! Though she said that she didn't like it, I tried to force her into this marriage. That was my mistake! Suneesh, my son! He is saying that she doesn't like you. Then tell him that I don't want her either, Dada! In that case, my son doesn't like your daughter either. Cheating me after promising money? You pig! Hey, even if you are Idea Shaji or BSNL Shaji, I won't give you a single penny! Hey, I didn't get the name "Idea Shaji", because I worked at the "Idea" company. People named me "Idea Shaji", being stunned by my amazing ideas! Idea... Idea... Idea... Idea... Shaji's Idea! They are reverberating across this land! Hey! Hey! Hey! Your ideas are nowhere close to amazing! They are idiotic ideas. Get lost, you idiotic Idea Shaji! Get lost, you unfunny, loser Unni! Alligator... Alligator! How will alligator rhyme with "Unni"? Fool! Egg...! Hey! "Unni" inside the chicken egg! Unfunny, loser Unni, fool Unni... Whichever Unni you are, I care a damn! - Bloody f**** - You son of a b****! I am calling off this alliance. That's my decision as well. I called it off a long time ago. I said it first, right? Get lost, you fool Unni! He hung up! His dad is the fool! Your cuss words were too good! What else should I do? Though I am not a fan of cuss words, I liked that you swore at him for me! Thank you! Shall I fix you a drink, Dada? No! I will have a full bottle. Phew! Or forget about the bottle. That was too much swearing to handle! Let me take a walk! Phew! Please get me my phone if it's charged, bro. This is better than what we get at our canteen. Your phone is really slow. I'll get you a new phone when you come to Smarty's. We have an exchange offer. I'll definitely come. I need good stuff. I had already planned to buy it. Hey Usman! Head straight to my house. What about the Bolero, sir? We don't need it any more. - Okay then. - Okay. Yes, Chetta. Joshi Sir, the vehicle driver will come only tomorrow. Then, the driver... I wanted to send him there today. It won't happen now. Won't I get it tomorrow morning itself? You will get it by tomorrow afternoon. By afternoon, you mean... won't it be evening? There's a chance for that too. Oh no! Chetta... - Okay. - Thank you. Thank you so much! At what time will you be coming tomorrow, sir? If what Suresh said is true, that Bolero will have at least 200 kg gold. 200 kg? But isn't it full of speakers, Boss? They must be smuggling gold in the shape of speakers. There were gold biscuits earlier, right? - Yes. - That is correct. - Boss? - Yes. What is your idea, Boss? My idea... Greed... is the issue for all of us. No. It's not like that, Boss. - Listen to me. - What? One speaker per person. So, it will be five speakers for the five of us. That's enough, right? If we can't take at least 15 speakers per person, why are we getting into this, Boss? We got beaten up for no reason! Are you a goon or a porter? You want to take 15 speakers together? I will take the Bolero, Boss! Not necessary! One speaker per person. - Okay. - Got it? That's my idea. That's enough. That's fine. What? What the hell are you saying? Do I have to load these six boxes myself? Then I'll bring trade union workers for loading this! How about that? I was kidding. I'll do it myself. - Hello Chetta. - Hello? Hello Sir. I have sent the load. Okay. It will reach soon, right? It will be there soon. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Move that vehicle. Yes, over there. Are you paying me for this or...? I will pay it. Just take this there.

Nice! - Okay then. - Okay. You will have to start once again. You may leave quickly! Step on the accelerator! Pray for me, okay? Hello Joshi? Yes, sir. Well, our timber issue here is sorted. So, we're thinking of coming over there now. Now? Yes, we will come now. Sir, can you give me half an hour? Half an hour? I am in the middle of some work. Then do this. - Bend down. - Come through the side. Let Boss go first. Let's do that. - Okay. - Okay then. - Shall we take it? - Boss! Who is it? Hey. Keep it back! - Who is it? - How many are you taking? - How many are you taking? - I am asking you. Who is it? - Joshi, come quickly! - Joshimon? - Come fast, Son! - He is coming, Boss!

Who were those guys, son? - The guys who came that day? - Yes. Must be the same gang. So, shall I get you some tea and Vada? - Okay. - Look at you! My poor son had to run so much! Call me if you need anything. Thank you, Mr. Rakesh Manjapra! Thank you. Open the door! We wiped half the station clean! Stop here. - Hello, Joshi. - Yes. If you could give the vehicle key, we can take it to the station. - The Bolero's key? - Yes, the Bolero's key. When you take it to the station, park it where the timber was lying earlier. - Okay. - Let this be here. Here you go, Sir. - Why are you panting? - Nothing. I was exercising. - I will take the bike later. - Okay. Well, Joshi... I need a favour. - I have a difficulty in riding the bike. - Okay. - So, can you drop me in your car? - Okay. - I will drop you in the Polo. - Come quickly. Hey! Turn it around from here. Okay, sir. - Is it too much trouble? - Not at all. You can turn it here. I tried getting massages from many places, but it didn't help. Acupuncture will be great for this pain. Huh? Come, sir. I'll start the car. Come on! Go! Go! We'll follow you. Get in, sir. You are the first passenger of this car, sir. - Do that other step. - Oh, yeah! I am taking the car inside the house for the first time. I was going in reverse all the way, for all these days. I will give you ten seconds. You should throw everything out of the shop and give me the key. Wonderful airpods! Pack them for me. Undertaker? Why is this Undertaker here? Who is this gentleman? Military officer Singhania sir! He has come to buy airpods. What do you want? What do you want? - Huh? He's asking what you want. What do you want, boy? - Phone. - Phone? Yes. Android or iPhone?

Well, what will I get for Rs. 1 Lakh? For Rs. 1 Lakh, you'll get iPhone 10. Okay. So, it's iPhone 10 with 512 GB. Money? - Huh? - The money! It's a very good phone. 1... 2... 3... 4... Hey! Give it to me quickly. I have to count, right? 50... Okay. So, 99,900... Here's the balance. 100 Rupees! Okay? This is the bill. Smart boy! Good choice! Do come back if you have any complaints, okay? - Will you come again? - I will. - Come again. - Yes. Very nice place. See you next time. Oh! Oh! Thank you. This is yours, sir. Ouch!

I am going home. See you tomorrow! I will file a complaint against you. I swear! Dude, earlier when there was teak wood here, I took some of it. You filed a complaint. Did you get any reply for that? No, right? After that, you filed a complaint when I took rose-wood. Then, sandalwood... Mahogany... Marijuana... Gold... Cocaine... Ampoule... You filed complaints when I took all these from here. Did the superiors give any reply to you? So, what's going to happen if I take these two cheap speakers? As if you'll get a reply for this too! - Go and file a complaint. - Okay, sir. You can take it, sir. I have recorded everything you said now. Got it? Don't do anything untoward, Rakesh. Keep it back then. Suspension, dismissal or transfer... I will get you one of these! Okay? Fine! That's alright. Give it to me, sir. Here! Shove it down your throat! Wait and watch! I think I'll have to make someone stand guard here to protect this. - Hey Rajesh! - You will never prosper! - Get someone to guard this. - Okay. The speed-boat is nowhere to be seen! Wonder where it is. Won't that dude come? Will he not come? No. He will come. It's all set. - He will come after dealing with it. - Okay. Hello! Aha! Certain things won't happen as per our expectations. - This is one such thing. - What is this? Convey my apology to Freddy Boss. I am in a hurry. - Give this money to him. - What is this? I am in a hurry. - But Chetta, what about the shop? - Just tell Boss. - Chetta! - Don't call me again! Jumper Bro! - Is it because you need more money? - Hey! Huh? What the hell is this? A phone? Well, didn't we send him to evict the shop? Huh? Chetta... Did you evict them? Sometimes, things won't happen according to our expectations, right? Isn't that so? Take this. - Hold this as well. - Okay then. Don't be upset with us. Hey! Sorry! Sorry? Start the car quickly! Turn it around! - Manu! - Don't look at him! Go! Go! There's no point in staying here now. Let me try to grab some new alliance. - Dada? - Yes. There's money missing from the 10 Lakhs we gave them. What's with this small change and cover? Hey! This cover is from that Smarty's shop, right? Huh? Yes, it is! What is this? Did you send them to buy a phone? Must be the left over after evicting the shop! No way! There's no chance for that! - Check who it is. - Must be those guys. Wow! Look who's here! Manjapetti! Come on! Come on! - What are you doing, Shaji? - I know! The rent, right? It has been 4 months, right? Let me see. Hey, get that cash. How much is it? Four, right? - Take this. - Okay. Thank you so much! Hey, give him that phone as well. He should realize that we are decent guys, right? Here you go! It's an Apple phone. Okay then! - You are happy, right? - Shall I leave? It's all good. He hasn't understood anything yet. Hey, let's escape from here as soon as possible. Yes. That money is gone too! Shall I go and pack, Dada? Oh no! Should I think of some new idea? Sir, will you let me know when the Bolero is being auctioned? Yes. That will take some time. At least six months. - That's okay. - We'll let you know anyway. But I will be coming to Smarty's. You should come. - You'll give me a discount, right? - Sure! - Aunty! - Yes! Thanks. The tea was really good. - Okay then. - Okay. - Nice! - Stand there, Mom! Wait. What are the seven notes?

Freddy Bhai? - Hey Suresh! - What happened, Freddy Bhai? Where are you? I am at the class. What did you say about the speaker? What was the speaker made of? Gold! Hey Suresh! You sent me and my boys to a mad man's house! And he thrashed these boys. And I spent around Rs. 8,500 at the hospital. Which...? I told you only about the vehicle, right? Which house did you get beaten up from? You want me to give the address and Google Map to that place? Forget all that, Freddy Bhai. There's another great deal. Iron box made of platinum! Iron box? Yes. Suggest some realistic deals, Suresh! I said, iron box made of platinum! Platinum? It is true! - I haven't got the details of the vehicle yet. I will message you the moment I get the information. How many are there? 100 iron boxes, made of platinum! - Is it so? - Yes, Freddy Bhai. Okay. Huh? But who thrashed them? Hey! Play a song. I sent only the vehicle number to Freddy Bhai, right? Which mad man did they get beaten up by? But... who took the gold then? Dad! How many shops were there when we started? Hundred shops, in various sizes. Oh! Now only that mobile phone shop is left, right? Yes. Due to that bugger Idea Shaji's useless idea, I evicted everyone else. Well, now I have to bring everyone back. After that, you will manage it, right? Huh? - Me? - What? It's all yours, right? - I'll try, right? - Of course! - Come. Let's go. - Dad! - What? - I need a mobile phone. Well, Smarty's is right here! Come on! Okay. A snake is here. I'll call you back. - Have you come to evict the shop? - Don't embarrass me. This is my daughter. - Huh? - Sorry! Well, let me just call Joshi. Hey, I have an iPhone. But... can you suggest a good Android phone? What's your budget? It should be very fast. And, it shouldn't hang often. Let's check with Joshi Sir. He will suggest the right phone for you. - Is that so? - Yes. Can you ask him and tell me then? - Unni sir. - Yes. - Did Joshi sir answer the call? - No. Errr... Hello? - Hello. - Hello, Joshi. - This is Unni. - Yes, tell me. Well, you don't have to vacate this shop! Phew! We're saved! Thank you, sir. I've called everyone and asked them not to vacate their shops. I've called the ones who vacated back too. That is great! Well, whatever I said... please don't keep them in your mind. Hey! No way! There's nothing like that! Sir, you won't change your word again, right? I won't! Sorry... What's your name? - My name? - Yes. Baazigar without the "gar"! Huh? Didn't get it? B... Double A... ZI. Baazi. - Baazi! - Yes. - Did my dad ask you to vacate this place? - Yes. - Is that so? - Yes. Oho! Did that also happen, in between all this? Chechi, I am the manager here. Joshi sir is the owner. Your dad keeps cursing Joshi sir all the time. - Is that so? - Yes. - I will ask him. - Okay. Unni sir! Please don't hang up. Well... I will pass the phone to your manager. Okay, sir. - Joshi sir? - Tell me, Baazi. Well... What's your name? Sumangali Unnikrishnan. The "Sumangali" of this Sumangali complex? Yes. - Joshi sir? - Yes. Unni Sir's daughter, Sumangali, wants a phone. Which one? Android or Apple? Android. - It should not hang. - It should be fast. It should be fast. One minute. I'll put her on. Okay. Here you go. Hello. Joshi sir? Yes. Joshi sir... Sir? Well, you can call me Joshi. Oh! I thought you are an elderly person when I heard the name "Joshi". Huh? Elderly? I am not so old. I am not married yet. Okay. I call him "Sir" out of respect. He is a youngster. Can you please switch on the loudspeaker? Okay. One minute. Tell me, sir. - Baazi... - Yes. Give her a Samsung Fold Z3. Okay, sir. And, Sumangali... Yes, Joshi? Since this is your first visit to our shop, there will be a special discount as a gift from Smarty's. Okay. Thank you, Joshi. Hey! Joshi... It'd be good if both of you get acquainted. Suma will be handling the maintenance and safety of the complex hereafter. Is that so? That's amazing! Henceforth, I am going to concentrate only on Sumangali Jewellery. I can't handle everything together. And she has an MTech in Fire & Safety, right? That's awesome! - So, now the complex will prosper! - Yes. What? Are you saying that I was ruining it all this while? - Yeah! - Huh? Well... I didn't mean that! Yeah, right! Hey, Joshi. I am getting a call from my wife. One second. - Okay. - Joshi? Thank you so much for suggesting this phone! You are welcome. Thank you for the visit... ... and we expect more visits to Smarty's in future. Yeah, sure! - Okay. Bye! - Okay. Bye, Joshi. See you soon! Okay. Yes, Subha? What? - Your cat is missing? - Here you go! No, no. It hasn't come with me in the car. - This is a limited edition. - Is it? You are our new boss, right? That's why! - Okay. - Okay. Sumangali... Joshi. That's awesome! - Joshimon! - Yes! Oops! Mom! Here you go. Just try this tea. What kind of tea is this? This is a special tea. Drink it and tell me how it is. - How is it? - It's great! - You liked it, right? - Yes. Awesome tea! Okay. Let me go and prepare lunch. I will come after that. Oh no! The gold! To the DMKR fund, Rs. 85 Crores... has come from an NRI account. Along with a letter. I will read it aloud. Dear Chief Minister, The 85 crore Rupees that I've sent you, was made without the Government's knowledge, by cheating the Government. I had to work really hard to get it to you. Hence, I've taken 10% service tax from it. Out of these 85 Crores, 40 Crores should be used... to build 400 houses costing 10 Lakhs each, for the homeless people. If you assign this task to young architects, they might even build two houses for 10 Lakhs, with great quality! From the remaining 45 Crores, Rs. 25,000... You can get 1,80,000 laptops worth Rs. 25,000 each. They should be given to students who don't have laptops. Let me say one more thing. We had a huge Priyur mango tree in our house. Every year, it produced around 1000-2000 mangoes. From that, we used to take 100-150 mangoes for our needs, and distribute the rest to the townsfolk. My dad used to say that they will get rotten at home if we don't do that. So, I am taking the mangoes I need, from what I got. That's my service tax. I am donating the rest to the public. Yours faithfully, Gold! - Dad? - Yes. Can you find out who this "Gold" is, for me? - Who? Me? - Yes. Dear, he is elusive to the entire state of Kerala. So, how am "I" going to find him? But since this is your request, I will try. Should I choose Joshi... or "Gold"? You tell me! BEEP O' dear Gold just for cheap thrills I'll take her around covered in gold O' dear Gold in the morning in the night made in gold the Buckingham Palace along with a home theatre at the roof-top will give iPhone a run for its money rules the entire world covered in gold O' dear Gold just for cheap thrills I'll take her around
