Not bad, Winter. But that's not my thing. I prefer the 19th century. My dad used to collect those. You could buy them by the square yard. If you had money. I have some interesting square inches here. Let me see. That's the one! Winter, that's a sloppy job! Bad workmanship! Your reputation's at stake. Don't worry about me. Photo retouchers are overworked these days. You know, like the tip of Trotsky's shoe. But not a whole hand! It can happen. Who is missing? Precisely those whom you suspect. Your "missing persons." I'll take this one. But clean... without any slipups. I've got 20 negatives we need to discuss. Who trusts negatives nowadays? I'll take this too. Because we Americans are so sentimental... I'll giveyou $5,000. But for the real McCoy, eh? Is that a fair deal? Jesus! Are you ill, young man? Don't fall onto the paintings! - Shit! - Don't come back, scumbag! Let's see what you're made of, you two-fifths human! Come on! Jesus Christ! - Watch the closing doors! - You're crazy! Do you do this often? You could have broken every bone in your body! Does anything hurt? My spine. Especially between the shoulders. You might have internal injuries. I do. I'm one big injury. I'm going to die right here in your car. At this point, I usually get a laugh! And probably a big check foryour pain. It's more a shock. I could use some "shock money"! Let's say... 3,000 cash! Areyou nuts? Only complete idiots would carry that much cash. I need it for someone who only takes cash. That's my problem. Okay. Let's go see him together. One moment. A few more details. What's he doing? He's had my picture, my name, forweeks. Mr. Engel, ifmy marbles are working right... am I buying you a passport? I hope so. References are so important! A certain Winter uses his service. Winter? Tell me... do we happen to know the same Winter, by any chance? Maybe. I only know him casually. I shadowed him once. Well, then, doyou have any more pain? Not right now. Ready to dive into the next car? Provided, of course, it's got a sliding roof. No. I'm a free man now. I'll show my passport to anyone who bothers me. You do that. But then what? The future is open to all. That's what I've observed. I'm a good observer. I realized that. That should come in handy somehow. Come on. I have a proposition to make. An offer you can't refuse. It sounds good. What have they done to you? You look great! Gratefully returned. Things are looking up? - You're moving up in the world! - I'm doing business. As a silent partner. This is my old friend, Karl. My name is Emit Flesti. How doyou do? E-M-l-T F-L-E-S-T-l. How do you do? Pleasure to meet you. Looks like you've done pretty well for yourself there, Karl. Let me guess. You're an entertainer. Wait, wait, wait. Maybe you're in advertising. Nothing like that at all, Mr. Flesti. It's an ordinary kind of business. I'm a business partner. What kind of business? - Import-export. - Oh, hell. It's not really any ofmy business anyhow. But you look smart. And I can see you're going places. - Good-bye, Damiel. - Bye-bye. I'll be seeing you, Karl. Long ago... there must have been a golden age of harmony between heaven and earth. High was high, low was low. Inside was in, and outside was out. But now we have money. Now, everything's out of balance. They say time is money... but they got it all wrong. Time is the absence of money. Would you agree, Karl? What can I add to that? Time is running away from me, Mr.-- Speedy Gonzalez. He sure talks a lot. What a pile ofmoney. Do you owe him? Few things fall from the sky. Time is precious. You made it back! I knew it! That's great! Wait. More, more, more, more! Now up! And swing it! There's nothing better than this. There's nothing greater! It's like the old days! Great! He's good. He's getting the hang ofit. Just leave him alone. I cut him some slack... but it's only a question of time before I nail his ass. Leave him alone. Please. Toserve. To fiinallyserve! Serving is the best path, Raphaela. I'm starting fromscratch. Waiter... you'll make captain some day. - The water is too warm. - Oh, sorry. Charlie, scratch my back, will you? That's enough. This must be a joke, Patzke! He has seen too many bad movies. No discussions. I said the other foot. Excuse me. What's up? You gotta be nuts, Patzke! You're from Detroit, Mr. Baker. Don't they do this there? Man, wake up! This is Berlin. We always welcome new ideas. Especially American ones. And that cement... within three minutes... will be bone-dry and rock-hard. And good and heavy. By then you'll have signed over your entire inventory to me. Including your client lists and everything else. Don't move! No way! You'll never get them. You think I'm dumb. But now time's on my side. It's no longer ajoke. He's crazy. Areyou really serious, Patzke? You'll get 20 years for this! Shut up! Charlie? You see what you've done to my Charlie? What's going on? Hands off, moron! Shit! Don't point it at me! Him! Attaboy. Gentlemen? It's collecting time. And now pull your boss from the water before he gets wet. You drive. We have another deal today? A big deal. Today we drink to friendship. Here.Join me. Friendship is the biggest deal. Right? The biggest of them all. Cheers. It's crazy... but I'm just beginning to grasp what you did for me today. It was a pleasure. Can I go? No. Karl... I want-- I want to thank you. I want to do something for you in return. Tell me what you'd like. My friends should live well. You hear? I want to participate. A percentage. You'll get one! My father always said: "Trust no man. But if you find one you can trust, buy him immediately." You know... I just made up my mind. I'll give you two percent of my business. All right? Shake, partner! I won't consider less than five. Three. Six. You're really great, Karl! Let's have another one. Okay, five percent is fine. Five percent ofmy honest business... for a hundred percent ofyour honest face. That's a deal. I really can't complain. The rent they charge down here is dirt cheap. I could even have had all the hangars... where they used to assemble the Messer schmitts . You know, Karl... you're my partner. You've got to see where all the stuffis stored. - Down here? - Why not? I find it pretty depressing. One thing you've got to remember, Charlie. If you deal in trash, you don't need a fancy address. In the East, all they want is porn films. Be careful, Karl. Porn and violence. Isn't that weird? Preferably, both at once. They're sick ofthe so-called " New Man." And since they're all short offunds... they pay with what they have plenty of. What's that? Be patient. It's a joint venture. Shut up, Khadafy, and sit down. Sit! Don't be afraid. He's a sweetie pie. Hello, my beauty. You'll get used to him. To him, too. Right, Grumpy? Right, Mr. Becker. People get used to anything. This is Charlie Engel, my new partner. I'll continue doing movie deals, and he'll handle the rest. What rest, Tony? Jog along, pal. I'll show you. Lock up behind us, Grumpy. Sounds like an earthquake, right? We're right under the runway. The best spot for video duplicating. All bootleg, ofcourse. All bootleg. Grumpy runs the whole show by himself. In here, my friend... the Nazis stored everything they ever photographed. One spark... would have turned all this concrete into chewing gum. There is your five percent ofreality. Have a good look. Khadafy, come over here. Keep quiet, okay? There's enough ammo around here... to blow the foundation out from under those guys above us. Hey, man, don't pee in your pants. Some people like dirty pictures, and others like guns. Theywant sex and violence. They paywith weapons. What can I do? That's the name of the game. You're insane, Tony. No, Charlie, this is business. And if we don't do it... somebody else will. Then do it... but without me. I don't believe any of this. Hey, Charlie, this is no time for-- Karl, old boy, you can't just walk out on all this. Come back, Karl... or I send Khadafy after you. Go get him, Khadafy, and bring him back here! Sit, Khadafy! Khadafy, you're a real son ofa schmuck! How could I have been so wrong, Raphaela? How could I be so blind? Can one fall to hell without meaning to do evil? Without even recognizing evil? Once one recognize sit, what should one do? Runaway from it? My true friend, help me back to thelight! I'm coming. Then I'll make use of time... each second, each minute, each hour. Nothing will deter me or hinder me... or standin my way... if I just get out of here! I must do some good, Raphaela. I want to do something well. I heard a shot. I can't even handle this thing. Damn it! I didn't want to hit anyone, Winter. I'm in shock. What are you looking for here? I'm searching... as usual. I found nothing, as usual. I wanted to warn you people... but I came too late. Are you in pain? No... not at all. For the first time... I feel weighted down. My blood has weight. Finally... I have weight. I am... heavy. A nice feeling. Winter... will soon be over. What did you want to warn us about? Winter! How often did we hold them, carry them across? But I can't escort this one. Are you there, Raphaela, to hold us both? He's dead, isn't he? Did you come... to shoot me too? Are you-- Is that you? I'm not afraid of you. How long have we known each other without ever having met? I don't even know your name. You... you know my whole life! I... I remember so little. When you die... you should know how you lived. Come on. Tell me my story. Come along. Your story... how did it start? I still remember. For a long time, you resisted repeating baby words... but, all those years, your face had a cunning expression. Once, when I leaned close toyou... I heard your little body... filled with very loud laughter. Your favorite tree was the walnut tree in your grandfather's garden. You would sit under it for hours... Yes. holding a small puppet that you allowed to dance... only when a passing grown up complained loudly about the mosquitoes... that didn't bother you under your walnut tree. When they cut off your curls... because you were supposed to become a boy... you didn't cry... even though you really wanted to. But the tip of your nose turned completely white. During class you loved to gaze out the window. The windows were very high... with panes made ofbeveled glass... except for the top two... which the teacher could open with a long pole with a hook on the end. You always managed to sit at a desk where you could watch... the movements ofthe treetops, the birds and the clouds. With the exception ofone time. It was then that you decided to grow up... at all costs, as soon as possible. You wanted to become an architect... and build schools entirely out ofglass... that would rotate to follow the course ofthe sun... and at night, when the children were asleep... the teachers would set the school back in its starting position. When you turned 1 4... you fell deeply in love... with a girl called Milda Kosewort. Oh, yes. Yes. I remember that. And what happened later? Hanna, hurry! Come, Anton! We're not getting out, Konrad! Drive on! Gertrud! Hurry! Gertrud! Hurry! Don't dawdle! He has Anton. He mustn't get Hanna too. I understand, Mrs. Becker. Did you fall asleep? Somebody has to tellme whether I lived right. I don't think I was a courageous man. Proper, yes, but not courageous. Wasn't it courageous when you took in that frightened little Hanna? That wasn't anything special. Any decent person would have done that. She had no family left. Yet that's when you started asking different questions... even thinking differently. You became a different Konrad. One whose job was to explain the world, and who could too. One who had to recount the thousands of stories... he had invented throughout the ages. Human stories, from the most ancient to the very newest... all meant to be the original story. You had little Hanna to protect, and became protected yourself. Your life had finally found a mirror. Another life, still young, had begun to grow... because, in you... because in you she found all she needed. What else can I say, Konrad? You're someone who was found. Thankyou. Someone who was found. Oh, I-- I must have dozed off. How do you feel? I feel as I did 30 or 20 years ago... without exaggerating. Listen, that coffee will be too weak. - I can tell. - It's delicious. You want some? No, thank you. Look what I found. You kept it this long? I couldn't throw it away. That boy who flew with his father to America... - was Hanna's brother, right? - Ofcourse. What was his name? Do you mean you forgot? He was called Anton, like his father. Anton Becker. Well, Anton Becker came back! You mean Tony Baker? Come on, we'll drive to town. No... I'll drive! I'll drive you to town. We have to hide Hanna and the girl. As fast as possible. But where? I know an old steamboat. It'll do for now. A boat is good. I have a plan, Konrad. He's full ofthe best intentions. He's pure and gentle. You're making me cry. - You're cruel. - No, on the contrary. I just have no pity. You know me. My rules know no exception. I'm the purist. You wouldn't recognize purity if it bit you on the nose. Bit me? I'm sorry to say, nothing ever will. In the long run, I'm the one that does the biting. In the long run, you'd be bored to death. You're forgetting-- I am the long run... and your friend's in my way. I'll have a coffee, please. I can't see you, but I know you're here. I wish I could talk to you eye-to-eye... because I know you're beautiful. I sense it. It's always the same problem. I know you're here, and I know you're not afraid of me... but I can't see your face. Come on. Take my hand. You want to talk to somebody? Companero, talk to me. I am here. Hey! You made the switch! Well, good for you. - What's your name? - Cassiel. No. Karl Engel now. Engel now. Very good. When did it happen? Not so long ago... but I feel much more happier than ever before. You see? I didn't promise you too much. - You want a coffee? - No, thanks. I have a problem. What is it? Money? Papers? That's all-- Is there anything I can do to help you? - Can you tell a good story? - A good story. - Does it have to be true? - No, in the opposite. It has to be phony as hell. This is a very strange request. Can you do it for me? For a very exceptional situation? Life is a very exceptional situation. I want you to meet an old friend. Do you remember the last time you were in Berlin? I think we're getting cable. We've had cable for two years. Not at home, dummy! Here! That's bullshit! Look at monitor six. That's "Columbo." You're right. But that can't be! But it is. It's weird. A technician should check it out. This cable stuffis beyond me. That's Gate 1 6, right above us. - You're nuts! That's "Columbo"! - What's the actor's name? Falk. Peter Falk. Every kid knows that! Yes. He's at Gate 1 6. It's a TV series. Eh? - Maybe someone's playing a tape. - No! It's him! He's motioning to us! What do we do now? Mywife won't believe this! Switch on the audio. Hello. Finally! - What took you so long? - That's him! - Can you hear me now? - Yes. Yes, we hear you. What do you want? Would you open the door, please? We have an appointment at 11:00. See? The coat. Twenty minutes! - Good evening. - He speaks German. This is Mr. Falk, as you can plainly see. Hesays we have an appointment for 11:00... to scout this location... the Security Center down there, where you are. Do you have written permission? - What? - Have you got written permission? We weren't notified. Oh, that! Yes. We have it. Here. We've been authorized. Here. Come in. You here the buzzer? Yes, thanks. We're coming. If that's Falk, that's a real scoop! You, me and Columbo. Better than any autographs. Look. The monitor is right here. We have the first shot here. Master, from above. Include the monitors. - It's him! - So, it's good. - Hello-- - The second shot here. He says, the second shot here. Camera here. Reverse master. Include the monitors. - And then-- - The room is very nice. Cassiel, we're inside. It's a good ceiling. I like this. For the lighting effect. He likes it because-- And we have doors. One, two, three, four. It's all good. Room is good. First thing, now, videotape. First we'll shoot it all on video. - A video? Here? - Yes, with this gadget. I'd better turn off that camera. - You're filming here? - We're filming here. Yes! There's a camera. Switching it off. In the first scene... Columbo is looking contact lens. In this scene, Columbo searches for his contact lenses... the actor who plays Columbo. - It is him. He plays Columbo. Sure. - Right. You-- Columbo. He's asking you to pretend you're Columbo. - Him, be Columbo? - Yes. - My name is Peter. - Me too. Horst. Wonderful. I'm Daniel, personal assistant. Dustin Hoffman. Dustin Hoffman. - Yes. - Asleep. - You-- Dustin Hoffman. - Me play Dustin Hoffman? He wants you to play Dustin Hoffman, sleeping. Sleeping, sleeping. He means, sit down here and sleep. So the guards cannot see the monitors. It's logical. One sleeps, the other looks for his lenses. Neither sees the monitors. Because the murderer comes through the door. The murderer, the murderers come in through this door. Sure. It's great that you're here. Right. I'm looking for the contact lenses. You look down there... and I'll be filming you. Yes, very good. Looking and schlaf-ing. Cassiel, go to the runway. Very good. Now the criminals are coming. You sleep, you look. Now we'll film you from further back. Quiet, because the music comes now. Mr. Falk says the music starts here. As you snore, the music starts. Just snoring. - I keep looking? - Yes! You can move when you look. You can move. Move, but keep looking. Closeyour eyes and stay down. Wonderful! Thank you. Mr. Falk is very pleased. Maybe it's that hole. The air duct. Yes, it must be. Without getting wet? It's possible... isn't it? How do we get there? Let's go. Who goes first? Can you manage on your own? No problem. I have a score to settle. Karl, be careful. Don't do anything stupid. - You know me! - Precisely! It's business, Charlie. If we don'tdoit, somebody else will. Wrong, Mr. Becker. Ifldon'tdoit, nobody will. This should all gosky-high, the violence and its seeds. Next. - We're too far. - I can't reach. - Should I let go? - Let it drop. - What was that? - Karl. - How many more? - Only about twenty. 1 29... 1 30... 1 31 ... 1 32. I agree... to carry your hardware... but not for long. If the stuff explodes... then good-bye, boat! Who'll pay for that? - It's my loss! - Yes, Captain. Bye-bye. - You're leaving? - I have to. You know... work, home, family. - Stay well. - Thank you. Good luck. You again, Speedy Gonzalez? You know the old prophesy? "In the year of hate... when all that is foreign is despised... by the full September moon... dark riders will invade the harbor... take the ship with all the hands on board... and sail it into hell." I know all prophesies, but not this one. - You made it up. - What's the difference? It just happened. Leave me alone. I want to go home, find a girl... lead a normal life and get ajob. That's a nice plan, but someone fucked it up: Patzke. He hijacked the boat and took your friends as hostages. Come on, Cassiel. Hop on. You have no choice. Head inside! Shut the window! Was that Damiel? Yes. - Can you hear me? - Yes. Let me explain a couple ofthings. Time is short. That's the first thing. For the weasel, time is a weasel. For the hero, time is heroic. For the whore, time isjust another trick. If you're gentle, your time is gentle. If you're in a hurry, time flies. Time is a servant ifyou are its master. Time is your god if you are its dog. We are the creators of time... the victims of time and the killers of time. Time is timeless. That's the second thing. You are the clock, Cassiel. I'm attached to my life. I don't blame you. I love being alive. It's rushing by so fast. I can't do a thing about it. The boat will get here in about an hour. Don't be afraid. Your guardian angel is with you. Unbelievable. You know, I hear Momma's voice again. You're just like her. Don't you remember how she used to tell us a story... every night before we went to bed? Come along. Patzke, leave my family alone. Take me. Shut up. Don't play the hero. Who wants you? Come along, kid. Be very quiet. Very quiet. Don't move. Go up the stairs. Shit! Get below, or the kid gets it! You don't understand? Shit! Get back down! You understand? Get inside, or the kids goes overboard. Follow the man upstairs. Go ahead. Move it! Now stand there... and keep quiet! Okay. Come on. Let's get you dressed. I want the whole crew in the cabin now. All hands below deck! Don't be afraid. You won't get hurt if you do what I say. Stay cool. I'm not kidding! Don't even think of trying anything... or I'll blow this whole tub sky-high! What are you gaping at? You're making me nervous. What's up there? It's so far away. I am even scared to look down. It's close. Come on, Cassiel. You weren't ever scared of heights before. It will never work. Make yourself dead weight. Humans are heavy. Fucking gravity! So long! That was the word on your forehead. Him again! Cassiel. I must be home gain. I can hear your voice. I always heard yours. Andl watched it all. What's more, I saw the world through your eyes. Humans see differently. They no longer see like us. Now their eyes can only take. They take in, they take notice of. Their eyes can no longer give. They've forgotten that light enters the heart through the eye... and then shines back out through the eye from the heart. The cycle is broken. What happens now, Cassiel? You weren't even really here, and you're already gone. Letus remain friends. You! You, whom we love... you do not see us. You do not hear us. You imagine us in the far distance... yet we are so near. Weare the messengers... who bring closeness to those in the distance. We are not the message... we are the messengers. The message... is love. We... are nothing. You... are everything to us. Let us dwell in your eyes! See your world... through us. Recapture through us... that loving look... once again. Then... we'll be close toyou... and you... to Him. Is your ear ringing again, Papa? Yes, it's ringing again. It's Uncle Karl. Yes. He has arrived. We're on our way.
