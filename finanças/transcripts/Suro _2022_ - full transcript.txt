Listen up, guys! A toast to Helena and Ivan! It's been a tough few months since we shut down the cooperative. I've had to move back to my parents'... what can I say? But let me tell you, it's not all bad news. Most of us go around all day talking about changing our lives. We go on and on about this and then we do nothing. You've always been more about action than words. Well, especially you, Helena. We know Ivan is a big mouth like the rest of us! It's true. - Me too! - Yes, yes... What you're about to do is very brave and we're so proud of you. Gorgeous! We want a house-warming party! - Yes, we do! - Sure thing! In the meantime, because we love you so much... roll the video! If we put the vegetable garden facing east... - Yes. - on that slope, the wall will keep the seeds warm. And we'll open up the window to the south. Right? There's no rush for that. I want it finished before I have the baby. And a pool when we get some money. When we get a lot of money. We'll do it. Look. Hi, Enric! Gee, here already? - Hi, Enric. - The architects? - How's it going? - How are you? Good journey? Yes. Hi, how are you? Looking at the ruins your auntie left behind? Shut up! We're excited. We'll fix it up. You still have time to go back to Barcelona. No, the tourists can keep it. - Come here. - What? - Look what your auntie left you. - What? Poum! Hi, Poum! But... Is this for us? Hi, Poum! Hello! He's gorgeous! Where are you taking him? Your auntie kept him here in the enclosure. Tied up? She had him loose because it's all fenced in. There's lots to eat. What do we do with him? Feed him and then think about getting another one. Another donkey? Yes, because donkeys need company. Sometimes they won't even eat if they're all by themselves. No... Poum... You don't like being lonely. What a sleepy head. Yes. How are you feeling? Fine. I'm tired. That's normal. Everything okay here? We need to change the beams. To stabilise the structure. We can restore them. It would be cool to keep the original materials, right? It'll be pricey. We can do it ourselves. Can Falcó has around 1200 acres. I've checked it out and if you strip the cork this year, you could make between 10 and 12 thousand Euros. - Do the wages come from that? - No, you pay them first. - How much? - They get 150 Euros per day. That's a lot of money, isn't it? No, they leave the forest in really good shape, they're locals, and they need to eat every day. - Is this burnt too? - Yes, it's burnt. This is useless. See? What we were saying is that it'll be a very dry summer. A cigarette butt still alight or North winds could start a fire, so we must be prepared. Excuse our ignorance, but what does "being prepared" involve? First of all, have good hoses. If fire comes, you'll need to defend the house. The paths and undergrowth must be clean and the tank must be full of water. That way... What tank? - Yes, in 1989, the ADF... - No, it was 1988. Yes, 1988 or 1989. The ADF installed a water tank for each house so that the helicopters can get water in the case of a fire. They sound like the apocalypse is coming. Fires must be their yearly entertainment. This is deserted. - Want to shoot a little? - Yes. Ready to lose, or what? - Shut it. - How about a head start? How about a beating? One, two... Mines a bit wonky. - You're a bit wonky. - Shut up. - Afternoon. - Afternoon, Maurici. - How are things? Three please. - Yes. - Wow, they're pretty good. - They're well trained. So I see! Come on, guys. Look... Look through here. I know how it works! Do you live here? - Yes, in Can Falcó. Do you know it? - Yes, Dolors' place. She was my auntie. - I'm Maurici Benach. - Helena, pleased to meet you. - The new landowner? - Yes. - Hi. - How are you? Very good. OK. Do you have someone to harvest the cork? It's what we do. We've kind of sorted something already. I did it for Dolors fourteen years ago, I know that cork well. I could get it done in about six weeks and pay you around 20,000 Euros. - Twenty thousand? - Yes. - Do the wages come from there? - I take care of it all. That's a net price. We get started and pay you when we're done. Ask about Maurici Benach, we do a good job without any problems. - Great. - Thanks. Thanks. That's not bad. He seems like a rural tyrant. Someone probably told him we were there. Yes, Maurici Benach has eyes everywhere. Were those even his kids? Maybe he paid them. Let me tell you, there must be a reason your Enric didn't mention this Maurici. And he sure doesn't seem shy with his words. - You're reading into it too much. - But it's a bit dodgy. - What do we tell Enric? - We're not married to Enric. We can't pay the guys from the cooperative, can we? Unless we refurbish after the harvest. No, you're right, we'll do it before the baby's born. We'll work with the coop guys next year... if they haven't all fallen out by then. Hi there! Which could happen in Catalan forests depending on the drought conditions, rises in temperature or radiation. Conditions that will determine where and how climate change will affect us most. Especially with beeches and deciduous oaks which respond quickly to drought by shedding their leaves. They shed them and wait to see if the situation improves so they can grow them back. Unlike other species such as pines, for example, which tolerate bad conditions much better, they're better prepared. This resource, called Vulnemap, shows which areas... Good day, ma'am. I've heard you live alone in this farmhouse. I've come to keep you company. Your aunt was a good woman but she'd lost her marbles. She knew nothing about the forest. If you ask around, they'll tell you I'm in the cork business. What deal are you offering? I've had many interesting offers. I'll get it all done in a minute and a half. Haven't you seen me going round on my tractor mower? You haven't heard the...? Haven't you felt the earth tremble? Helena? Is that your name? No! You stink! You're all dusty. Come here, I'm a forest beast! I'm a beast! Stop! No! No! Why you... Damn it! I can't! Stop it! I'm pregnant! What a nerve! Come here! Where are you going so early? I want to get there first. You're the boss, you don't have to get there first. We have work to do today. We'll buy the hoses later, I promise. If we're going to live off this, I should learn. Go back to sleep. - Morning. - What are you doing here? Here I am... It's not necessary. I know, but... I thought I could help and learn how it all works. It's my estate, right? Why don't you say say a few words? - What? - A few words to start the season. No, thank you. Otherwise they'll think you're here to control them. Go on! Guys. Come here. This is Ivan, the landowner's husband. He's going to say a few words to start the harvest. Well... Good morning... colleagues. I've come here today, the first day, to make it clear from the start that I want us to work together. Beginnings are important so I want you to know from day one that I want us to work together. You probably think I have no idea about all this and you're right. But... I'll do my bit like any other worker. Anything you need, you know where Helena and I are and if I have any questions, I'll ask you. That's it. Let's have a good harvest. Sharpen your axes, let's do this. Come on, guys. Let's go. Excuse me, who are you? I'm Ivan. What's your name? - Karim. - It's a pleasure. I'm working. Morning. Are you working at Can Falcó? We work wherever Maurici tells us to. Mohamed? Who's that? Check out the boss! - Morning. - How are you? Good morning. Maurici? Yes? - Can we talk? - Yes. These men up here... The Moors? - Don't say that. - Come on. - What are their conditions? - What do you mean? - Are they insured? - Ricardo. Tell him to chill out. He's used to Barcelona life. Are they insured? Look, in our work... Some seasons you can, others you can't... Their situation is really good, they're happy working. Just ask Mohamed, he's really happy. What if something happens? There won't be a problem. I'm responsible for everything. We've been doing this for years. It's fine, don't worry. Want to have a go? Right up in the air. Hi! How are you? - How are you, love? - Good. I've bought groceries, ready for lunch? Morning, everyone! Morning! How's it going, Maurici? Are they behaving? They could go faster but it's quality cork. They'll get faster. How many tons today? This truck has one and a half. The numbers are looking good. Let's go eat. - We're not done yet. - They can finish. Maurici, can I take Ivan for lunch? I've told him he doesn't need to be here. If I leave with you they won't have any respect for me. You go. What do you mean? - Go on. - Come for lunch, please. Go home, I'll be there soon. Have you stripped a tree? My love... It takes years to learn. We could try. - Another day. - Morning, boss. - Hi! - Want me to show you? - Of course! - Come up here. Morning! - Which one, boss? - Whichever you say. This one, then. See this stripe? Here? Take the axe with two hands. Okay. Strike it head on and twist the head. - Like this? - Yes. Hard. Here I go. Good! - Now what? - Twist it left and right. Left and right. - Left like this? - That's right. Helena, you shouldn't be doing that. - Again. - A bit lower. One, two... No! One, two... Three! There you go! Did you hear? A little lower. What are you doing? You shouldn't be doing that. Stop being annoying. I'm almost done. He's pissed off. Look! You're not buying it. Let's go have lunch. Let's go have lunch. I'll come when I'm done. Move. Out of the way. - I'm going in. - Yes. Bloody hell! What you've done here is incredible. I'm really happy. I thought we could widen that opening to frame the views. Then two more on the ceiling to bring in more light. Great. And a long bench here? For reading or napping. Or downstairs? But up here too... It doesn't matter. Let me show you. It's a bit posh, isn't it? They're references. I love some of these details like the contrast between materials. The local materials. The balance of the spaces... The way it blends in with the surroundings. It clashes with it, they're little palaces. I imagined something simpler, more integrated. Lots of people will see the refurbishment. If we do it right, we could get a lot of work. But what kind of work? And for whom? That's the thing. Well then, show me your references. That way, we can discuss it. How's the harvest going? The harvest? Fine. But I think Maurici has Moroccans working illegally. It wouldn't surprise me. Helena? What should we do? It's not our problem. Yes, it is. They're working here. - What do you want to do? - Something. If we report it, we'll get no money and they'll have no work. We can't accept it, Helena... Have you asked them what they want? We need to sort out the water tank tomorrow. - I can't tomorrow. - Why? - I have to go to the forest. - You're so stubborn. - You don't have to. - I want to. Why? Because I like it. And I want to learn to do it my own way without Maurici or dodgy deals, working in a collective, the way it should be. - Damn it. - I'll go, I'll go. There's some good stuff there. Thanks for doing all this, really. A drug dealer from Figueres will buy the house for sure. Let's go eat. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Thanks. Careful. It's really hot. Yeah. What's up, Hassan? Nice day today. It's really hot. I'm thirsty. Have you been here long? It's my third season. Hassan and Yassin have been with me since the beginning. And Karim? It's his first season with us. Where did you harvest before? Morocco. Andalusia, Extremadura... many years. - Do they treat you well here? - Yes. - Where do you live? - In a house in the village. It's hardly a house. It's a wreck. Are you happy there? It's just for one season. We have to put up with it. Yes. It's just one season. If you need anything, if you have any problems, you can talk to me. Okay? Thank you. It's only a few days and you won't stop complaining about the house. Are you coming? It's 4:30 p.m. Be right there. So? What's this car, Helena? I changed our car for this. Isn't it cool? What? Where's our car? Our car used to hit all the bumps, we could hardly leave the house. But... why are you using the past tense? Where's our car? Have you lost it? Have you? Listen, this is what we need. We can go everywhere with this. Look at it! Help with those, please. Will you help? Unbelievable. Don't be mad. It's like the one the harvesters have. God dammit. Fucking Chema! Something wrong, Maurici? Whatever Chema was celebrating last night is still going on. He hasn't come. Come on, guys. Let's go! - Morning, boss. - Morning, Chema. Spoken to Maurici? Me and Maurici have an understanding. What a fucking disaster, these guys are cheap, but... these necks are shit. - What? - These necks... This is no good. You have to take this off. Watch out for dry soil, if there isn't any, come back down. Okay? - We'll go up and make our way down. - Yes. Ready, boss? No, you go on. Thanks. I'll walk, I fancy a walk. Let the match begin. Wait, wait. Come on, let's go. Come get it. Come get it. Here, here. Come here. You can't do something like that without talking to me, you know? Did you talk to me when you swapped our car? Yes, you're right. It's exactly the same. No, you're right, it's very different. You should have seen the conditions he was in. It's not our problem, Ivan. No. Tell Maurici to handle it. Maurici will send him back and it'll happen again. His colleagues ignore him. He just got here. He's only 18, Helena. Be a bit more caring. You won't make me feel guilty. If you need to do things like this to feel good about yourself, great, go ahead. But don't bring strangers onto my property. "My property"? Did you talk like that before? - Before? When? - Before. - Before? When? - Before we came here. We weren't having a baby before. Our priorities have to change. Or am I alone in this? Fucking hell. I want to live according to my ideas and pass them on to my child, that's a priority for me. I hope they don't get your stubbornness. At least they'll be passionate about something. It's easy to be a die-hard idealist when others take care of things you don't want to do. Or when someone else works while your account is empty. Or do you want to live in a squat house? What the fuck are we doing? No. He's in the stables like an animal. If he comes up, he'll have dinner with us every night. Can you hear yourself? Come on. Sit down here. Hello. Thanks. You're welcome. Do you speak French? A little. Almost everyone in Morocco. Of course. Thanks. He doesn't speak French. I know. So you understand each other. Enjoy your meal. Thanks. Muslims don't drink alcohol, do they? Oh, enough. Sorry. He thinks he's seen the world. That he's super cool, you know? But he has a really closed mentality. Has he travelled a lot? Yes, he's travelled all right but his ideas don't change. He never sees what's in front of him. Like a mole. What? You know, like a mole. Digs the earth and travels through tunnels but sees nothing. A mole. What did he say? I can't translate it! The bitch's fanny was like that, the dog was drooling behind her... Four and a half hours... for nothing. - Morning. - Morning. Hi, how are things? Did you take the little Moor to live with you? Yes, why? Me first. Hey. Who gave you permission? What's up with him? Karim, what's gotten into you? They sent him to fuck around. I said, get out. What's wrong with you, dipshit? Have you no shame? Get out, dipshit. Hey, boss. How are you? What are you doing? Resting a little. My back hurts. My back... bad. There's a lot of work to do. Come on, Karim. Get to work. Go on. Hey, you know that doesn't go like that. Delicious. Want some? Yes. Thanks. Here. See this, boss? I have wine, you have walnuts. This is the life! Thanks, it's good. What are those tattoos? I did it in the Legion, the Green March, it was 45 degrees and with two needles. They guy who did it was wasted on panther's milk. What's that? Condensed milk with gin, half and half. And the tattoo? - The Bridegroom of Death. - Of course, the Legion... But that's not you any more, right? No. - Hey, Maurici. - Morning. - Want some wine? Walnuts? - No, thank you. Something wrong? Yes, I'm fed up with the workers. They need to go faster, but it's not happening. The North wind has turned and the cork will dry out. If they dry out, we won't get the kilos we said. With the wind, the cork doesn't come off the tree. Morning! Morning! And Ivan? He stayed behind to talk to Maurici. Let me help. Let me help you. Thank you. Hi. Hi. How are you feeling? I have a headache, but I'm fine. How about this North wind? Yes, it's crazy up there. Hi, Karim. - We must fix the tank tomorrow. - I can't tomorrow. We have to work faster or we won't do the tons we estimated. - Are you that behind? - No. The wind makes it harder, so we have to work faster. Fine. If there's a fire we'll have tons of ashes. Enough of that, Helena. It'll be fine. What if he comes with me? He's here to work in the forest. Nothing else. - Do you want to come? - I can't, Helena. Fine, you go to the forest, he'll help me. I'll pay him myself. I'll call Maurici now. Whatever you say. Try them on. I think they fit fine. Let's see. Walk a bit. Take that end. Okay. What's that? What? The yellow plastic? Yes. You'll see. Okay? Yes, fine. Hold this here. The first one on your left. Okay. That's it, slowly, slowly. Hang on. Is it working? No. One, two, three! Super! What are you listening to? EIGrande Toto. Moroccan hip hop. It's cool. Shit, no internet. What was it? EIGrande Toto? Yes. Did you leave the gate open? Shit. Poum! It's okay. It's okay. - Hey, what are you doing? - Ivan. Helena, you're not... What are you doing? You shouldn't be doing that! I'm so sorry. I love you. Ricardo! Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop! What are you doing? You'll get it stuck. Are you crazy? Who told you to come this way? Mohamed! - Mohamed! - What? Why did you tell him to come this way? - Who told you? - You did! I said nothing. He's making it up. What the fuck did I say? I didn't say a thing. Now you get it out of there. I've had it. First the North wind, the cork not coming off and now the tankette stuck here... What's going on? You have to do three tons per day or the numbers won't add up. Yes, we'll have to cut your wages. How much less? Without three tons? A quarter less. Fuck that. Three tons with this lot? What the fuck are you on about? I'm explaining that the chief won't pay us full time. Come on! Get the tools to dig the tankette out! Let's go! Here! If not, it won't move. Come on, Quim! Get going! Tie it to the front! - Come on. - Let's go! - Give me the cable. - Tie it here! Get out! Gently does it. The path's over there! One moment, please. Go on! Go. - Okay. - Okay. That's it. Go wider! Get out! Do it again. I'll remove the cable. That's enough! Hey! That's enough! Come on! Get stripping the trees! You're sleeping on the job, get to work. Hey! Mohamed! In hard times, you just sit down and die? Get to it, for fuck's sake. Get to work. You're the ones who need to work. That's what I'm here for. Do you think I'm here for the fun of it? I'm here so that you all work. Chema! Haven't you seen these people? All day pissing around. Let's get to work. Come on. Come on, Chema. Easy, Chema. You'll kill it, it's too big for you. No way. It's strong, it won't die. Leave that. Come here. Come and help me. I can't reach the crown. Are you deaf? Help me, man. I can't reach the crown. What are you saying? Stop pissing around, let's get to work. You're really asking for it. Come on! Who do you think you are? Get down like this. One hand here and another here. Be careful. Don't let me fall. Go on! Go on, will you! You've got it coming to you. There. Molto bene! How about now, Ambrosio? Anyone can do it like that. Keep still! Careful, lad. Keep still. You'll make me fall. Steady, lad. Keep still! Chema! Get off me, you fucking Moor! Chema! - What happened? - Get off! What happened? What happened? Look for his fingers! Look for them! Manel, the tape! - Find them! - Look for them! Find the fingers. Ricardo! The car! It's here! Wait, wait. Here's the other one! Come on! Come on! Come here. There you go, Chema! That's it. Come on. Hang on in there, Chema. Hang on. Let's go. Get in the car! You did it on purpose! I didn't do anything! Fuck! Quim, for fuck's sake! Come here. Stay there. He did it on purpose! He did, I saw him! It was a fucking accident. Could have been any of us. - He dropped him. - The doctors will look after Chema. Listen to me. All that we can do now is work. - Your answer to everything. - Come on, work. - Work, work... - Guys! Back to work. Fuck you. - It was an accident, back to work. - Fuck you. Ricardo, back to work. Please. What did you do, boy? You just bring problems to us. I didn't do it on purpose. Didn't you hear me? I swear I didn't do it on purpose. What are you saying? What is it? What? It was an accident. He didn't mean to hurt him. Stop it, Karim. Go home. You too! Leave me alone! Go home, for fuck's sake! Fuck you! You're nothing but problems. Ivan? Ivan? What are you doing here? You can't be here! Get out! Right now! Sorry, sorry, sorry... - What are you doing here? - Sorry... What happened? Where's Ivan? Sorry, sorry, sorry... What's wrong? What? What? What's wrong? Answer me. Calm down. Help me. - Calm down. - Please. Help me. Help me. Breathe. Slowly. - How is he? - He's stable. They gave him something for the pain. But they can't save his fingers. Really? Really. Chief, how's Chema? - He's stable. - What does that mean? It means... He'll lose his fingers, the tissue was dead. Son of a bitch. We'll help him as much as we can. But he won't work the forest again. What will his family do? - I'll help them as much as I can. - How? Fucking hell. - Where's the little Moor? - I sent him home. Get him out immediately. - And then what? - I don't know. Put him on a bus, a train, whatever... or things will get messy. Hey... It'll be okay. Don't worry. We'll help you. Thank you. I have to take him. Karim. Come on. Where? The bus station. Come on, please. Come on! Wait, Ivan. We have to help him. More than we already have? Do you know what a mess he's made? It was an accident. Is that what he told you? Why the fuck are you smoking? Ivan. Ivan. Calm down, please. Helena, we're in a lot of trouble, you have no idea. He needs to go right now before things get worse. Not without my money. - What did he say? - He won't go until we give him what he's owed. What right does he think he has to demand anything? Come on, you have to go! Come on, shit! I'm not going! Ivan, what's wrong with you? We need to pay him. And who'll pay Chema? The sooner we pay him, the sooner he'll go. He can go ask Maurici. I don't recommend it. We'll pay him then. No fucking way. Get out! I've had it with him! What the fuck, Ivan? You don't treat people like that. Go to the bank and we'll pay him. Yes, boss. The land left behind is bleak. The junction dividing the region in the east and west has burned down. Sometimes, we can see how close it came to houses and farmhouses. On the AP7 motorway, from the air, we can see hard-to-reach areas still burning uncontrollably. From the air, visibility is very difficult because the wind can blow the smoke over 100 kilometres. As we get close to the fire, however, we can see that it's far from easy as it has split into many sources, many columns of fire, and the smoke stretches for over 60 kilometres. He's here. I'll be right back. What's going on? What do you want? You know what we want and it's nothing to do with you. Where is he? - Get out, please. - No. No. Karim! No! Leave him alone! Hey! Leave him! Karim! Helena! Helena, are you okay? - They went after him. - Give me that. - I'm coming. - No. Helena. Stay here. I think he gets the idea. Boss. This isn't your place. This is my estate. Leave him, or you'll see who's out of place. Get on home. Come on, Quimet. Hear me, Quimet? That way. Mind your head. I'm going for it. Ivan, Ivan, Ivan! Go on then! - Are you going? - Again! My turn. Throw Helena in. Helena, Helena! - What a house, Helena! - Thanks. Amazing rooms. Hey! Do you want to talk? Let's dance! Laura! Laura! Change this shitty music! Laura? I love you! - What's this shit? - Come on, Bàrbara! Ivan, Ivan! Leave it on! - But what is it? - Fucking leave it on! - Nobody wants to listen to this. - I do. Leave it on! What's wrong? Fire! What? Fire! Quickly! What do we do now? Defend the house.
