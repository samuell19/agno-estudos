NOVUS MEDIACORP and OPUS PICTURES present A BA ENTERTAINMENT production LIFE RISKING ROMANCE What do we do now? Chop it up. Torso at work, and bury the head in the front yard. It’ll be cathartic seeing the head every morning. Ms. Byeon, that’s a killer idea. But it’d be a bit wasteful just to chop it up. Is there another way? Wait. Did you hear something? Who are you?! Stay back! Hey, Jane! What are you doing here?! Jane! Police! Freeze! You’re under arrest for murder and… The interior fits the crime novel publisher’s office. This doll is so lifelike. Sergeant, what are you doing? This is for our best writer. No pictures please. She’s Korea’s Conan Doyle, Ms. Byeon So-jeong. It was a simulation to understand a killer. It’s crucial for a writer to become one with the character. And a pseudo-writer sees it and makes a false report. You thought I was having an affair with her? And plot to kidnap and kill my wife for insurance? I’m asking just in case... Did you tell my wife? I don’t believe it! Jane, I’m gonna sue you! She’s not a writer, she hasn’t published in years! Your hands. She won’t flee, no need cuff her. No way, she’s a town nuisance, a serial false reporter! - Cuff her feet too. - Huh? Town nuisance? Hey, honey. A suspect farted, it was like diarrhea gas. Sorry, you were eating? Get in. He’s coming, look sad. You were caught red-handed, that’s 3 years! If you weren’t a contractual writer! I’ll repay you with a great book. Forget it! If you don’t bring me an idea in a month, first draft in 6 months, published in 1 year, I’ll really sue you for breach of contract! We signed so long ago! I don’t even want a bestseller, just bring one good idea! You report a butcher shop for selling human meat, a tattoo artist for being in a gang. Keep it up and you’ll be forced out of town! Whatever. And go to a clinic, it’s really bad. For reporting a potential suspect? No, your fart! It’s irritable bowel syndrome for sure! I just need to write a book! It’s stress-related. I don’t have any ideas, not one! Hey, Jane. I was actually thinking about that. Mind your business and catch the serial killer. That’s what I’m referring to! Base your new book on the Itaewon serial killer. The case is open, so it’s media-friendly. Go on. Let’s go camping over the long weekend. We can come up with great ideas! - Camping? - Yeah. Why pay money to be a homeless? And why should I go with you? Who else then? Huh? A man who looks stylish in a suit, full lips that’s perfect for kissing. Your perfect man doesn’t exist. But you’re not it. What? Where you going? You got a report to fill! Could you do it for me? Not this time! I’ve been doing that for you. You're cuffing me enough times today. Ms. Han, stop right there! That’s enough. Please stop. Buddy! Can’t you do it for me?! Hey, Jane Han! They have a weird relationship. Stop that thief! Handcuff thief! ‘Thief’? That’s too much! A man who looks stylish in a suit, full lips that’s perfect for kissing Your perfect man doesn’t exist. He's right here... Who the hell? Let go of her! Let her go! Let go of her! Who the hell are you?! Can anyone tell me what's going on here? I just wanted to help. I thought you were chasing a criminal. No, you have done nothing wrong. That was all our fault. Anyway, I apologize. What the heck is he saying? Just say ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you’. Sorry, thank you. Me too. There goes your chance. Here comes insecurity. Shut it. I’m jealous, she met her perfect man. Lord, if you allow us to meet again, I’ll attend church regularly. You startled me. Was I in your way? Are you… Hur Jong-gu? You are him! How do you know my name? Well, where do I know you from? MOST WANTED: HUR JONG-GU (36) I… I’m sorry. I mistook you for a church friend. Anyone home?! Sher Lok House at the end of alley! I found Hur Jong-gu! Could you look the other way? Jane. Lok-Han! What now? You got a report to write. Hur Jong-gu, 2 larceny convictions, expert at fleeing. I’m sorry, she’s a bit… Sir, please calm down! Put the knife down and let’s talk. Freeze! - Stop right there! - Hey! Hey! Hey! You could’ve died if it wasn’t me. You didn’t even know him. At least remember names on the wanted posters. By the way, why’s there a suitcase? Suitcase in a vacant house could only mean a body. There’s nothing to see here, please head back home. What? No problem, no problem. Come back home! Go back home, you idiot! You bastard! Salute! On duty! Nothing to report! I’ve had it with you! Is this nothing?! Then why the hell am I here?! - We’ll rectify! - You call yourself a cop? You let a suspect to flee and tamper with evidence?! What a stupid moron! 3-month suspension or a transfer to the province, take your pick! This is CBL’s Yum Chul-ho! I’m at the scene, where third body was found, and the police declared Hur as the prime suspect, and sent out a national APB. Itaewon Serial Killing Case. Victims were naked inside a suitcase in vacant homes. They were strangled with a unique belt buckle. Victims exhibit no signs of resistance or sexual assault. If they did not resist, it’d only mean they felt at ease with him. Are you serious?! Damn you, Windows 98! Don’t kill me… Please… Emergency Dispatch, hello again, Ms. Jane Han! A woman is being murdered. Very good, you sound drunk. You should hit the sack. Please stop calling! It’s for real! Hello? Hello? A woman is dying! Jane He never answers when it’s urgent! Fine, no one will believe me? Can I really catch a killer? Food leaflet, you bastard! Jane, what are you doing? Hey! Jane, come on out! She’s not answering at all. Are you nervous? Just sleep with her already. Get out of the friend zone. Tonight’s the chance, birthday is a weakness. One kiss is your ticket out of the friend zone. Stay out of my affairs! Move! Friends don’t have each other’s keys. Jane! Jane! Jane, wake up! Dude, perform CPR, give it a go. Open airway, check breath! I don’t think she’s breathing. 2 rescue breaths! No, no! Your chance is slipping! Okay. Chest compresses. Right on her boobs? Serial killing in progress! Killer lives upstairs! I have to up there before the evidence is gone. Let go of me first! Strangulation and the luggage, it’s the same method. You only heard it. But I’m 100% sure! Nobody’s home! Traces of the combination should still be there. You idiot! We can’t enter without a warrant! A warrant? Warrants aren’t given away as birthday presents. Happy birthday, Jane! Who still uses Windows 98? Here. Sher Lok-Han! I’m so moved! You should stop reporting and start writing. Yeah, Jane. It’s not right this time. You mean, it’s not this time either. You douchebags! Listen! I’m sure this time! Bae is coming tonight, so I’m gonna take off. The boyfriend who studies abroad? I gotta cook, and get ready for a steamy night. I just tried it out. Taking something without asking is stealing. What are you doing tonight? I’m free thanks to my suspension. How about a steamy night too? Pervert! I’ll kill you if I ever see you! Your girlfriend won’t be happy to know you’re here this often. Hey! I think I met you before. Yeah, I know. What brings you here? I live upstairs, #602. Upstairs? #602? I just moved here. Sorry if I was too loud yesterday. Ah, yes... I usually watch movies while showering. So sorry about the noise. See you. Isn’t that your perfect man? He lives here? Yeah… The serial killer upstairs… Use that imagination to write your book. I got a surefire idea for a crime novel! So you’re gonna write about the Itaewon serial killer? Yup! Go on. A woman is murdered, and a novelist living downstairs witnesses the crime. But no one, including the cops, will believe her. - Because! - Because? She cried wolf one too many times, and reported everyone in town. That writer reported me too, the Itaewon nuisance. Catch the killer by following the story rules… Jane Han’s spectacular comeback! 100% true crime, extreme suspense, thrillers! So the novelist and the killer fall in love? Huh? But love is overkill… She must use love to get close to him! It’s the easiest way to get to the killer! This will be a big hit at the book launch party! - But, boss. - Yeah? What if I capture the real serial killer? You’ll be a bestselling writer, like Ms. Byeon. Like Byeon, eh? Think about it. A crime writer catches a real killer, and turns it into a novel. Wouldn’t you be curious to read it? As if crying wolf isn’t enough, you’ll go on a hunt? Why don’t you just call the police? Even you don’t believe me, so what’s the use? Itaewon Serial Killing Case HQ Isn’t Hur the prime suspect? He’s not it. Look at his face, doesn’t look like a killer. He does look like a criminal though. He looks cute, very manly too. Hur’s not it. Larceny never translates into serial killing. First victim on Aug. 20, second on Sep. 11, and third on Sep. 24. This is the killer’s safe zone. Either the killer is in here, or he dumps the body within 7 days in a vacant home. #602 moved in recently, he might not know this area well. Not at all. While searching for his home, he must’ve seen all vacants here. You feeling it? He likes dimsum. I love it too. Huh? FBI? Most serial killers dream of becoming the law. Domination, manipulation and control are all common traits of serial killers. I got it. #602 wants to become an FBI agent. #602? Jason Chen, the Chinese-American! He arrived early August, maybe. He wanted a room for 2 months, for some seminar. I wonder what Jane Han’s up to! You reported me as a kidnapper! It was a misunderstanding. He’s got the expensive suite, he must be loaded. What are you doing here? Don’t get wet. You’ll catch a cold. See you. Jason Chen, early 30s. His hometown Miami has an open serial killing case, that is very similar to the Itaewon case. After arriving in Korea in August, the killings in Miami stopped, and bodies with similar traits showed up in Itaewon. Could it be a coincidence? Found in vacant homes, Asian women, suitcase… Unique belt buckle? It’s Jason! Jesus H. Christ! I’ve never seen six-pack in person. Amazing… If you eat chicken breast and do sit-ups, anyone can have it! If so, then where’s yours? Give it. I’ve never seen such perfect curves! Amazing! It’s the push-up bra. She pushed up even her baby fat. Isn’t that your bra? When did she steal that? Buddy, I’ve had it! Come here! This is considered assault. 2 years in prison, $5,000 fine. Sexual harassment for you, 1 year in prison, $7,000 fine! Private property damage, conspiracy to commit a crime, maximum of 3 years! It’s open! Jesus… He even has autopsy photos. Illegal search, 5 years. That’s 8 years in total! Buddy! Stop yapping and pop the trunk. Hello? I’m in Seoul for a seminar. Lok-Han! It’s Jason! Come here! What do we do?! Have a great Thanksgiving. Speed bump ahead. Multiple speed bumps ahead. One kiss is your ticket out of the friend zone. Your fart is a bio weapon. You got no manner at all. Jane, wait for me! Come on! Let’s go! Lok-Han! Don’t go! Dammit! Let’s get him! What the hell! Jane! Help me! Jane! Jane! Salute! Nothing to report! Sir. You must be attending the seminar. Please, have a seat. Get the hell out! Sher Lok-han… I’m sorry, sir… Get off of me! I’m sorry, sir. Sorry, so sorry! Allow me to introduce FBI profiler Jason Chen. Alright, let's get started. As an FBI profiler… He’s a real FBI. … from the crime scene. And the missing piece is identifying the suspect. So, he’s an FBI, who’s also a serial killer. Next victim maybe? I got you now. What a unique interview. A mystery writer and FBI profiler. Why’s that bitch here? What can I get you? Coffee… Caramel macchiato for me. FBI is too busy for dating, right? - I'm not busy at all. Really? - Are you sure? Isn’t it a crime for an FBI agent to be so good looking? I'm not. Tomorrow we have a launch party for my novel. You will come join us, won’t you? Sure, I'll go. It's my pleasure. Okay, then… Can I come to your place after the party? Let’s grab a drink. Is she seducing him? I’m just curious about what kind of books an FBI agent reads. He really is the killer… Once we find this buckle at his place, it’s game over. But how do we get in? You want to come to my place? Okay, no problem. You can simply be my girlfriend. All the boys are crazy to bring the girlfriends to their place. Netflix and chill? Jason, have you ever shot a gun? In Quantico, you must shoot, if you draw your gun. It’s in the first section of the FBI code of conduct. There’s a similar rule in the writing method. If the gun shows up in Act 1, it has to be fired in Act 3. It's Anton Chekhov. It’s Jane! This is a writers’ soiree, but you haven’t written anything in 5 years. Then Victor Hugo must not be a writer. He wrote Les Miserables for 16 years. We haven’t introduced ourselves yet. I’m Jason Chen. I’m Jane, Jane Han. Jane Han? Are you the author of ‘Psychology of Murder’? What? How did you know? You really are! It’s an honor to meet you. I really like your book. Jesus Christ, Jason! Do you really read that kind of book? Of course. I see, you have some poor taste. Byeon, it’s not about taste. How you described the pedophile in the book was quite realistic. The big guy who drives a kindergarten bus, is inspired by John Wayne Gacy. How did you know? You did read my book. Do you have any new story coming up? I’m really looking forward to it. By the way, can I have your autograph next time? Please? Are you okay? I'm not drunk at all. I'm sober. I'm fine. I’m really not drunk, baby! We can drink another one in your place. Baby! Netflix and chill, let’s chill! You’re drunk, you have to go home. Good night. No! Baby! You sure dodged a bullet. I saved your life tonight. So, you want to go together? I hope Lok-han’s watching… Do you like espresso? Yeah, sure. Never been to a single man’s place? Yes… No, no, no! I’ve never been. You look so nervous. Please make yourself comfortable. Unique belt buckle… Excuse me, I have to do something about that. Hey Jane. The alcohol makes me feel a little drowsy. Can I use your bathroom, please? Wait, so he really was watching a movie? I usually don't drink that much. Did you touch my bag? No… What you’ve done so far, are considered as crimes, Jane. You reported me as a murderer, have been tailing me. And now you’re searching around my place. Tailing? What if I am the real murderer... What would you do now? Writer Jane Han, can I have your autograph, please? 'Psychology of Murder' I’m heading back to Miami after the seminar. I like to prepare things earlier. Why did you pretend like you didn’t know that I was tailing you? An FBI agent chased by a mystery writer as a serial killer. That’s interesting. I’d be hiding in an empty house in this area, if I were you. The murderer always dumps the body in an empty house. If he’s still out there killing, he should appear in one of the vacant houses in this area. TEMPORARILY CLOSED Jesus! Lok-Han! You scared me! You scared me more! What’s wrong? I was being followed. Out of my way! What’s wrong with you? So, Jane, why do you think the murderer puts the body into the suitcase? Well… Maybe it’s reflecting the consciousness of the suspect, that he shouldn’t have been born at all. The reason? If you look at the bodies, the victims were all naked, and their poses remind me of a baby in the womb… Wow! Your imagination is outstanding. No wonder you're a good writer. Snap out of it, Jane. You’ll either end up in his bed, to get stuffed inside a luggage. How about… we go on a real date next time? Not as a suspect and a writer. Yeah, I’d love to. Good night. Good night. You love what? What are you doing here? I should be asking you that. Jane, you guys mentioned date or something. Are you really going to date him? Come on… I brought this. It’ll be a victim’s hair. Send it to the forensics. The forensics doesn’t do your chores. The last time you did this, it ended up being your own! Okay, fine! I’ll take care of it. Where are vacant houses nearby? A new body should surface today… Like hell! Our investigation is over! I’m out! You really are! It’s a great pleasure to meet you. And your imagination is outstanding. No wonder you're a good writer. This is so confusing! Jason Chen, who are you? Jane. The murderer always dumps the body in an empty house. If he’s still out there killing, he should appear in one of the vacant houses in this area. Vacant houses… Where are those in this neighborhood? TEMPORARILY CLOSED I got inexplicably good memory. Sherlock. Lok-Han... You’re no help at all. Well well. No one will notice me this way. Dammit! Thought you could fool me? Do I look stupid? What a dimwit. Hey, hey, hey. Really? It looks like the real thing. See? Stay back! Stay back! Stay back, you psycho! You stupid serial killer! What’s in the suitcase? Our wedding present. You think I’m fooling around? This is fun. So fun. Time to walk down the aisle. The trouble you caused… Hey! Calm down, sir. Put your knife down. Jason? I don’t wanna hurt you. Jason! I said put your knife down! Do you understand what I’m saying? Seems you don’t. What the hell is he saying? He’s the Itaewon serial killer. I saw him hide his suitcase! Die, you bastard! You really got me worked up. Jane! Jane! Are you okay? Let me go! Chief! Come at once, the commissioner is here! Bravo! Bravo! One and only FBI! Good job! Jane... He’s the one! You killed her! I saw you hiding at the wedding hall! Get him out of here! He was hiding there! I saw him! I really saw him there! It’s him! Things are getting complicated. How can… Do we have an interpreter? Hey, are you nuts? How could you go in there alone? Are you hurt? Jason was worried and followed me there. He caught the serial killer. Hur Jong-gu’s the one. He dumped a body at the wedding hall. Commissioner! Reporter Yum! We heard you caught the Itaewon serial killer! Wait a minute, you want my interview? It’s a bit of an inconvenience… A bit closer please! Son of a bitch… This is CBL’s Yum Chul-ho! . Ms. Jane Han, what exactly happened? Bam! After an upper cut, he immobilized the bastard! And then, “FBI!” Stop… stop! Oops, sorry. I got so into the role. Would you believe if a crime novelist was the one who caught the serial killer? I used the psychology of a killer that I learned while writing. Dormant period between killings shortened… Ms. Han, get to writing ASAP! So I infiltrated a vacant wedding hall… What’s that doing here? Byeon, I’m sorry. They fall in love, right? Crime writer and FBI agent… No, beautiful crime writer. Beautiful crime writer, and handsome FBI agent, they fall in love on the trail of a killer. Must they really fall in love? Jane, you got an idea? It’s a great concept! Start writing! He’s a US federal agent… Freeze! FBI! Meanwhile, serial killer Hur… Hur Jong-gu… Hur Jong-gu… Hur Jong-gu… Do you still believe Jong-gu is a true criminal? Jong-gu is just a thief. His appearance, occupation, intelligence… they all indicate that he doesn’t match the profile. You know that, Jane. That’s exactly how I see it. Nothing. Oh, it’s okay. Thank you. He just swooped in and took your girl. I have to catch the criminal and write a novel... Don’t worry. You have an FBI agent living upstairs. You need to start from the crimes committed to get to know the criminal. This is where the last victim was found. Some people say that there’s something in common, between love and hate. In either situations, only one person is wanted. Only that person can be a target. It was her birthday so she was here with her friends. The victim’s tracks are lost from here. Don’t look at it. I look too ugly. You look good, see? No, no! How’d he have lured the victim in? Maybe he was quite attractive. Like you. It is ironic. Normally, you’d expect to walk in here and have a good time, but instead, became tragedy. That maybe the theme of the killer, an insult to love and marriage. We had a similar case in Miami too. I was in the investigation at the time… There was a prime suspect, but he died in a car accident. Oh, really? We found out that he had been abused by his mother in his childhood. His mother was a prostitute, brought men to his house… So every time he had to hide himself in a big suitcase. And that’s why he chose immoral women to kill and put them in the bag. That is so sad. What? If he had been a happy child, he wouldn’t have killed those women. So you think he was not born evil? No one’s born evil. Look at children. They’re all angels. You’re an angel in my eyes, Jane. This place is a little scary. Maybe because the body was dump here. I thought you weren’t easily scared. I write mysteries because I'm timid. I always think about horrible things. Then the stories come up, that I can’t fall asleep easily. That’s no good. From now, I hope I can make you forget all those horrible things. Like this. I know it’s late but this is for your birthday. Jane Han! What are you doing there? You’re under arrest for tainting the evidence, and unlawful entry. Lok-Han, what are you doing? I’m doing my job, don’t get in my way. Lok-Han! I mean, Officer Sher! You’re overstepping your authority. Where’s the key? Jason is a consultant to the investigation. Of course he can enter the crime scene! He never sent us any formal cooperation request. He thinks we’re chumps! But you’re suspended right now! - Stay out of this! - Stay out of this! Are cops high and almighty in this part of town? Are you belittling me? This is an insult! It’s an honor to have an FBI agent. Honor my ass, Yankee go home! You’re out of control. Jane Han, you’re not going anywhere. What do you think you’re doing?! Come back here! It’s my last warning! How dare you! Don’t move an inch! Jane! We need to talk. - Let me go. - Just a moment, come out! What’s with you? Hey, stop it. I don't think she wants to talk to you right now. You stay out of this, it isn’t your business. Get in the car. I’ll take care of it. You bastard! Hey! Calm down, officer. What the hell is he saying?! Speak Korean! Son of a bitch! Stop it! Please! Stop it! You bastard! Sher Lok-Han! Come here! If you ever touch her again, I’ll kill you! It is truly a scary thing. This kind of emotion we call love. Thank you. Let go! Are you insane? How could you hit him! I should be asking you that, you said he’s a serial killer! You followed him to investigate, but end up kissing him! And what’s with that necklace? Is sleeping with him also in the agenda? Or is it already done? You look so pitiful right now. Don’t you understand? Be honest, have you ever seen me as a man? Just drop it, let’s talk later. Remember I told you that the Miami case had a suspect? The suspect was a local policeman. Yeah? As far as I know, the Korean Investigation team is looking at Itaewon case as a copycat crime of the Miami case. And Lok-Han is on top of the suspects list. Lok-Han? They found his fingerprints on the suitcase with the body. That was a mistake. It could be, because he knew his fingerprints would be found. So he might have touched the suitcase on purpose. If the emotion of love is denied for too long, that could be a trigger too. Ted Bundy was such case. He killed 37 women. How does an FBI agent fight so lousily? FBI my ass… He’s just an American Po-Po. Stop it already. This case is all but over. I can’t end it like this. I’ve never been so insulted in my life… I can’t just stand back. You’re really scaring me. Where are you going? What will you do? This is CBL breaking news! Serial killer prime suspect Lee Jong-gu escaped... I’m sorry. Hur Jong-gu escaped from police custody. What’s more troubling is that the police hid this information. Our tax is wasted on those cops! This country’s going to shit! Where are you from, assholes! Mind your damn business! Block this too, asshole! Wow, ‘Jane Han’ is #1 searched name. And our company name, too! Who is it? Sir… Officer Sher? It’s about Jane. I am sorry if I offended you when I said… Lok-Han might be a serial killer. That's alright. It’s not possible anyway. I’m going back to the States after my vacation here. You said you’re working on a story about mystery writer who catches a serial killer with an FBI agent, right? Can we give this story a happy ending? TV NEWS) With Thanksgiving long weekend starting tonight, massive migration down south has already begun. Although it was expected to begin tomorrow, many have already left the city… I look like a crook… For someone with no boobs, she sure is messy. This is so small… I could use it as sleep mask. Just wait till I get you…I’ll… Holy cow! What are you doing here? Lend me this knife. I wanted to cook for once but I got no knife. I told you taking something without asking is stealing. So I’m asking now. So many here… Leave that, please? New undies? You got a guy to show it off? Or someone who’ll undress you! The FBI upstairs? I’m not in the mood to kid. Damn it... New necklace? A present from the FBI? That’s it, out! - Go! Out! - Don’t you pity Lok-Han? Wolves make the worst shepherds. Why you little! Sorry, Jane! I’ll keep it a secret from Lok-Han! Why won’t he ever answer? Jason. I have something to tell you. Baby. Sorry, I don't think it's good time. Lok-Han. Lok-Han? Lok-Han. Are you asleep? Lok-Han? Yes, sergeant. Everyone’s away for the long weekend, it’s eerie. I could be wrong about it. I probably am. Lok-han’d never do that. No, but this is wrong. Emergency Dispatch, good evening, Ms. Jane Han. Go ahead. Jane, it’s me. I got something to tell you, please open up. Let’s talk tomorrow. I’m… really tired. Don’t come in! This is illegal entry! Must you be like this? But… Are you disappointed in me? Yes! I really am! Why did you do it? Why! Why! This isn’t you… Go away, I don’t want to see you. I’m getting transferred. Now that you found someone, it’s time for me to leave. Looking back, I was always with you. I was so happy to be by your side. I wish you’d find happiness too. Sher Lok-Han, you idiot. Stop crying! Don’t cry like a baby. Come here. I’ll find it for you. Lok-Han, don’t worry. The Missing Chick Case The kidnapper is… the junk shop man! Jane, should we just go home? No matter what, stay by my side, okay? My chick! You brats! What are you doing here?! Stop, you brats! What did you take?! Stop right there! SAT’s coming up soon. Which college will you apply to? Me? Well… You? Chung-ang University. That’s too bad, I need you! I actually wanted to go there too. The Hwasung Serial Killing Case Investigative Club Here, birthday present. So pretty! Thanks. I heard you got into SW Construction. How about police academy? Why? To become a crime writer, I need plenty of real data. I could use an insider. Thank you… Salute! Officer Sher Lock-Han, reporting for duty! Why you're wearing this uniform? What about SW? Government work is for life. Why did you drink so much? Something wrong? They say my novel is soulless. First snow! Make a wish. You can’t even fight. What’s the point of chasing a thief? Then do cops see thieves and flee? Better safe than dead. Why? Why? Because… Because… That’s all I did, and now I’m wanted. It’s because of the knife, you’re a thief, not a mugger. This is for my protection, it’s barely a knife. Don’t be startled, this is so blunt. It’s way too safe. You promise? You never killed anyone? Of course not! You know me. I’m really shy. That’s why I only rob vacant houses. I was so annoyed that I came across that body. Just thinking of the trouble I got into… I thought I’d never see you again thanks to Jane. That’s why I got you something. Tada! I’ve always wanted this! So pretty! Yu-mi, let’s live in Hawaii. I’m too famous here. Really? You got money? Nope. I need one big score. Baby, let’s rob this building. What do you mean? Because of the long weekend, it’s completely empty. - Yu-mi. - Yeah? You’re not only sexy, but super smart too. Baby, that’s a real knife. It hurts! Is it bleeding? It stings! How bad is it?! Sorry. I don’t think I can come with you. Why? Is it Lok-Han? I’m afraid that he has some tough time ahead of him. I don’t think I can leave him behind like that. Even though he is a killer? I have Lok-Han in every part of my memories. He was always on my side, in good times and bad. Now I feel like he’s another me. He may be a killer or he could be something even worse… but I will protect him no matter what. I wish I had that kind of love too. This doll sure looks real. I don’t think I’m fit to be a profiler. You moron, but you had to use a doll to practice killing? I wanted to help Jane, so I borrowed it. I’m gonna head down now. You’re hopeless… Well, look at the time! Sorry, cover me for 3 hours. No way, the chief will kill us both. Who cares, let him! If I don’t go now, my wife’ll kill me anyway. Her menopause depression is getting worse. I’m off! Oh yeah, Lok-Han! The thing about relationship is, you must risk everything. Even if it’s for menopausal wife. Lok-Han even practiced killing for you :) That bastard… What if I am the killer? Wait till I get my hands on you! I’m sorry? It’s nothing… FBI and Korean police… Forensics Friend What? Where did you get this sample? Why? Is it Jane DNA again? One of them is, but the other is the 4th victim’s DNA. You are the killer? I have to go. Hey! Lok-Han! Jason is the real killer! The hair sample DNA matches one of the victims! Jane! Jane! If you’re not mine, you shouldn’t belong to anyone else! Now I see what he meant.
