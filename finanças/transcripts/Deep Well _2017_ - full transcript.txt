Miss. Miss. I don't understand. Everyone knows ghosts don't exist. But a lot of people still like watching horror movies. That's because you guys think it's easier to pursue a girl by terrifying her. If you spend less time on this nonsense, you might get a promotion sooner. I am not like you. You are the most hard-working person in our company. I prefer enjoying myself. I wonder why the company would have selected you. Don't be jealous. I've been selected because of my handsome face. Do you think your face is worth three million? It's worth one million if not three. Though the prize is handsome this time, only one of us can win it. I can already picture my new house and luxury car. Hey... Wake up. You might be the first to get eliminated. Sorry, my flight was delayed. Where's my room? Upstairs. Let me help you. Thanks, but I'm fine. Cheers. Who do you think can get the prize in this test? Honestly, I don't even know what this test is about. I've never thought I would be selected. I am happy just to participate. Everyone here is capable. The company has chosen us, so we have to believe in ourselves. Haven't you been here before? Do you have any tip for us? I've come here every year, but the subject is different every time. So frankly, we don't know. Let's just follow the company's instructions. Anyway, let's try our best. No matter what the result will be, our efforts will be the rewards in themselves. Now that we have enough drinks, how about we play a little game? -What game? -Hold on. Do you want us to play Ouija or something like that? Do you think a clever guy like me will play those boring games? Seriously? Ye Nan. Draw a card. Kiss anyone of the opposite sex around you. This is getting exciting! Gao Yu. Can you help me finish the task? I... Ye Nan. You can choose to drink if you feel reluctant. You don't have to kiss him. Wang Bo, are you serious? If everyone can avoid the dares by choosing to drink, what's the fun of it? Kiss him! Kiss him! Ye Nan. A slight touch on the lips will do. -They're kissing! -Okay, enough. A slight touch will do. -Is it my turn? -Yes. -Come on. -All right. Let me read it. What's the color of your panties? Say it out loud three times. I am wearing black lace panties. I am wearing black lace panties. I am wearing black lace panties. Why didn't you knock? Why didn't you lock the door? I'm done. You were lucky indeed. You got all the good stuff. Ye Nan. Ye Nan. Don't go. Ye Nan. Don't go. What's wrong? You didn't sleep well? I had trouble sleeping in a strange bed. Were you fretting over what happened last night? Were you mad at me for cheering them on? Do you think I am so petty? I know you're not! You are both gorgeous and gracious. My admiration for you is like the continuous flow of the river, and the unceasing ebbs and flows of the tides. What a great compliment. Breakfast is ready. Okay, let's eat. SHEDDING SWEAT IS BETTER THAN SHEDDING TEARS Working out in the morning? Are you high on something? I have to keep my body in good shape. Otherwise girls will be disappointed. Join me. I am fine. I don't rely on my looks. You sure have some capabilities. Girls fall for you when you just stand there. Why are you staring at me? I am not interested in you. Do you like Ye Nan? Who's told you that? How's that possible? Last night I heard you calling out her name continuously in your dream. You know the company rules. Office romance is not only prohibited, it's even stricter for the management. Heed my advice and give up. Or it won't end well for both of you. I know that. -But when I see her... -I'm just reminding you. Even if you don't care about yourself, you have to think for Ye Nan. You're in a higher position than hers. Do you want her to be dismissed? Who played this crude prank? We came out together. The three of us came downstairs together. When I got here, I saw this as I opened the curtain. Is this a hint given by the company? We might get some clues from it. Is there any well around here? There's one in the woods. I also think it's a hint from the company. Let's go and check it out. I concur. Okay, let's go after breakfast. WELL Ye Nan. Hurry up. Why is it so foggy in the woods? I can hardly see anything. Why are you so timid? We are in the woods. Isn't it normal to be foggy? Hold on. It seems that we're back to where we started. That's impossible. We've been heading east. How's that possible? Don't you know the way? It's too foggy here. We can't remember the way. Could we have been lost? It seems to be... a ghost wall. A ghost wall? My elders have told me in some haunted places, an invisible wall may be formed, dividing the living from the dead. The living would be trapped inside and could never go out. Will we be able to go out? Stop it already. How could you believe that superstitious nonsense? There's an scientific explanation. Don't be paranoid. That's right. If we keep heading in the same direction, we will definitely go out. So here is the well. It's very deep. If people fall down inside, they won't be able to climb up. Not only people, even ghosts can't climb up. Sorry... I was only joking. I've heard that if there's a ghost in the well and it's trapped inside, it will be foggy around the well over time. Could it be... a ghost inside? Let's get out of here. All right. I don't think there's any clue here. Let's leave. Let's go. I was joking just now. Please don't be mad. Guess what I've found. The test papers! Here. Who will you save in a shipwreck? Of course I'll save myself. Is going to the well part of the company's test? It could be. If we had not been there, we wouldn't have received this test paper. But who have put them here? Could there be... someone watching us but we don't know? It's not possible. This house is not that big. If someone else were here, we would've noticed. It's good that we went to the well. Otherwise, I will be saying goodbye to my dream. Aren't you afraid you won't live to spend the money? Let's start the test. Everyone, watch the time. Eat more. Let's eat. We've been to the well and finished the test. What could be the next instruction? This test is strange. It doesn't seem logical. I wonder what will be the next instruction. Why are you looking at me? I don't have any instruction. I am looking at you on someone's behalf. Stop making fun of me. Yaqi's looking at you on my behalf. You're just too pretty. I do admire your cheeky manner! Wang Bo. You're surely brazen to show your affection. But can we be more serious at times like this? All right. If you've finished your meal, let's think about our next move. Gao Yu. I am scared. Let's leave here. No way. Haven't we agreed? We come here for the prize money. With the prize money, we will be able to have a grand wedding. If we give up now, we will get nothing. But... Trust me. Tonight, I'll wait for you. Why didn't you turn on the light? Why didn't I hear you walking? You nearly gave me a heart attack. You didn't hear me because you were in a daze. What were you thinking? You're walking around with a mask on your face. Aren't you afraid of ghost? If there's any ghost, it's here to see you. What's the matter? Nothing. You were shocked earlier, so I want to check on you. I am fine. Ye Nan. Don't you know how I feel about you? Actually, I... I don't care how you feel about me. We are just colleagues. Not really. Do you really not... feel that we...? Wang Bo. Don't force her if she doesn't want to. Gao Yu. It's between me and Ye Nan. Can't you stay out of it? You are her superior. You know your action may get her fired. Okay. All right. Well, you can go back to your room. Wait. I am going to get changed. Let's meet later. Gao Yu. What do you want to tell me? I've fallen in love. With whom? I've fallen in love... with you. Do you want to see me? Ye Nan, why do you dislike me? Wang Bo. I like someone else. Stop pestering me. I don't believe it. Are you lying to me? You must be lying. Wang Bo. I am telling you the truth. Stop acting like this. You are annoying me. Can you drink with me? I am tired. I have to rest. Good night. Wang Bo? Did you have a nightmare? Is it because you've done too many evil deeds that someone's taking revenge on you in your dream? If your mother and your lover fall into the water, who will you save? Who could have thought of this silly question? Is our boss out of his mind? He's the boss. He must have his intention. Yang Qian is gone. Her things are also gone. Call her on the phone. Now! My cell phone's gone. Mine too. The phone's not working. All cell phones are gone. The phone's not working. What the heck is going on? Yang Qian's missing. Could it be a challenge from the company? What on earth is it about then? Right. Could she have been eliminated? Otherwise, how could a living person have vanished without a trace? Something is suspicious. One of us might be a spy from the company. He or she's been watching us. Otherwise how could Yang Qian have vanished without a trace? Why are you looking at me? Seriously? Are you suspecting me? What are you thinking? Rest assured. I won't let you disappear. I have to get some air. I am not feeling well. Don't rush things. Let me check on her. Gao Yu? What are you doing here? I saw you walking alone and I was worried. I think I should check on you. I am afraid. Don't be afraid. It's just a test. When I've won the prize, let's start dating, okay? Really? But does Yaqi like you as well? The way she looks at you seems strange. Silly girl. I don't know if she likes me. I only know... you're the only one in my heart now. It's you? You've frightened me. Stop. What's the matter? Do you like Gao Yu? Yes. I like Gao Yu. He's also confessed he likes me too. He's told me... he would make our relationship public right after this test. Is that what he's told you? Yes. Yaqi. I know you like Gao Yu. But I won't leave him. So... you'd better control yourself. What if people call you the other woman? The other woman? What are you doing? Are you fighting? Yaqi. Don't you know I worship Ye Nan? Do you have my permission to bully her? Wang Bo. Why do you defend her? She doesn't even bother to look at you. Listen to me. Don't be overconfident. That's my business. I will take care of it. Okay. It's all right now. I won't let anyone hurt you. Why are you so annoying? Why are you... drinking alone? I don't need your sympathy. Why do you have to persist in pursuing her? This is not like you. What's wrong with me pursuing Ye Nan? I've already known. Ye Nan likes you. Gao Yu, I take you as my brother. But you take me as a dummy. Gao Yu! What is it? Gao Yu! Ye Nan. Ye Nan! Don't come near! -Don't! -Don't be afraid. What happened? Why are you tied up here? A ghost. A female ghost dragged me here. There's no such thing as ghost. Come! Let's help her up. Yaqi, where were you just now? What are you trying to say? Do you think I did that? It was me who called you to come. I still remember what happened earlier. Wang Bo. Stop defaming me. Enough. It's not the time to argue. Let's help her inside. Yaqi. What's wrong? What happened? She's back. She's back... Yaqi. Yaqi! What exactly happened? She's back. She's back. Who's back? Yuwei. It's impossible. Impossible. That red shawl belongs to her. I've recognized it. The red shawl was in... She's back... to seek revenge. Don't be afraid. I am here. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Who's Yuwei? Yuwei is my... ex-girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend? She's my immediate superior. As we had been working together, our mutual feelings grew stronger. Soon, we were in a romantic relationship. Although office romance was prohibited in the company, it didn't stop us having a relationship. TO THE ONE I LOVE, GY What happened then? Then... she disappeared. Our relationship simply ended. How did she... disappear out of the blue? I don't know. I tried looking for her but to no avail. After asking around later, I was told she had gone abroad. So... what about the red shawl? Yuwei used to wear it all the time. So... when Yaqi saw the shawl, she thought Yuwei was back. All right. Let's not talk about it. Ye Nan. You know very well you are the only one I love right now. When everything's settled down, I will only spend time with you. Okay? Really? This shirt belongs to Yang Qian. Why is her shirt put on this mannequin? Where's Wang Bo? I don't know. I haven't seen him for a while. The vines. I was tied up by the same kind of vines. I saw them at the well. I am going to look for Wang Bo. Wait here. Are you the one who's behind all this? Me? You've been stopping me from pursuing Ye Nan. But what about you? I've told you not to pursue Ye Nan for your own good. Moreover, she doesn't like you at all. You're just saying this in order to keep her to yourself. Ye Nan has made her choice. Is it my fault that she hasn't chosen you? Listen. From the moment I got here, I've been suspecting you. I know your secret. I won't let you get what you want. I will tell everyone about it. What do you know? Are you afraid? You shouldn't have done the evil deeds. Did you actually see I made Yang Qian disappear? I also want to know where she is. Last night, where were you? Last night we found a mannequin in Yang Qian's shirt, hanging outside the window. You were the only one who was not there. It must have been you. You did all this to win the prize. Stop slandering me. If that were true, I should also make you disappear. Wang Bo. Was this... one of your tricks? No. Fine! If you don't believe me, I will stay here. I won't go out. Okay? Stay here and reflect on yourself. Have some coffee. I think there's something fishy about it. Wang Bo doesn't have any motive. Isn't this obvious enough? But I don't think Wang Bo would do that. Though he always seems audacious and brazen, he won't harm anyone because of money. How do you know what he really thinks? I have something to talk to you. Well, I'll check on Wang Bo. Okay. Perhaps he will tell you the truth. I knew you wouldn't... Ye Nan. Do you believe me? Yang Qian's disappearance has nothing to do with me. I thought something was dubious, so I went to check on the well. Ye Nan. Do you really like Gao Yu? Do you know... Yaqi and Gao Yu have been dating for long? The other day, I saw them through the crack of the door . Ye Nan, I am sincere. My feelings for you are sincere. Gao Yu. We've been together all these years. I've never asked you for anything. For your promise, I've been waiting for years. I've been quietly staying by your side. I just want you to be honest with me. Have you fallen in love with Ye Nan? What about our relationship? You fell in love with Yuwei... and now with Ye Nan. Have you ever loved me? Tell me. Tell me! I've had enough. I don't want the prize. I don't want my job either. I only want a faithful lover. Is it so hard...? Coming here with you for the test... makes me very happy. However... when I've found out you like Gao Yu... I... If you can be happy with Gao Yu, I am willing to quit. But he's not a good choice. Though he likes Yaqi, he's been flirting with you. What upsets me the most is that Yaqi... Yuwei. You are still alive. Yuwei. I am sorry. Please forgive me. I didn't do it on purpose. Yuwei. Gao Yu. Gao Yu! You're finally awake. How are you feeling? This is not the company's test. We have to leave immediately. She's back to seek revenge. Who is she? Yuwei. Hasn't Yuwei gone abroad? No. That well... Gao Yu. What's wrong with the well? Why are you so scared of the well? Tell me. Tell me everything. Gao Yu and I... started dating when we were in the university. For him, I gave up my specialty... to get in the same company with him. He won the favor of his superior and got promoted to general manager. But to my surprise, Gao Yu and Yuwei started dating. They were dating. What about you? You know us girls. We just couldn't resist the honeyed words of men. He said everything he was doing... was for our future together. Because of Gao Yu... I got promoted... and a large pay raise. In that case, why did Yuwei go abroad? She didn't go abroad. That year, we were here for the company's annual test. It was our first time to participate. On the last day of the test, I saw Gao Yu and Yuwei walking into the woods. Yang Qian and I... were following them quietly. Yuwei, where are you taking me? You'll know when we get there. Gao Yu. Do you know why I bring you here? Why? Last night, I dreamed of a dry well. But it was covered with flowers. I believe it's a sign that our future will be better and better. Of course. You've got the prize. It's great. I'm not just talking about work. Gao Yu. Have you ever thought of marrying me? Yuwei. My career has just started. Why don't you give me another year? You don't want people to say that I'm living off you, do you? Why will they say that? Everyone can see you're capable. Moreover, I can't wait that long. Why not? I am pregnant. It's been two months. I want to have this baby. Gao Yu. Let's get married, okay? We can't. If the company finds out, I will be sacked. No way. I can't have this baby. I can't! How could you be so heartless? I don't care. I must have this baby. Haven't you told me you would tell her the truth? Haven't you told me you love only me? What's going on? Gao Yu. Gao Yu, say something. He won't. I'll tell you. Gao Yu and I have been dating long before he knew you. We are a couple. He has never loved you. He's been using you. Don't think you can use the baby to force Gao Yu in marry you! You're lying. How could he not love me? Gao Yu, she's lying. Stay away from him! What happen afterward? Didn't you think about... getting down to save her? We were going to save her. You killed her. No, I didn't do it on purpose. She slipped and fell. We have to save her. We have to save her. Gao Yu... We have to save her. Let's think of a way. Yang Qian. You won't save her even if you go down. The well is too deep. You will die if you go down. What should we do? A living person just fell into the well before your eyes! Shouldn't you do something? Let's call the police. Yaqi, let's call the police. Don't call the police. Don't call the police. We can't let the company know. Otherwise our career will be ruined. Think about it. No company would keep an employee involved in a homicide. Yang Qian. You will also be implicated in this incident. Do you want to go to jail at such a young age? No. I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to go to jail. From today on, we should keep it as a secret. Keep it to ourselves and never mention it again. But this is a serious accident. The company surely will investigate. What should we do then? I will pretend to be Yuwei to write a resignation letter, saying that she's got a better offer from abroad and that she will give up the prize. I will make all necessary arrangements. No one will find out. Well... Hasn't your mom been in the hospital? Her medical bills in the future will be paid by us. We will also give you a lump sum every year. And then you went back? Later on... we tried eliminating all the evidence. Aren't you afraid you would get retribution? I've been having nightmare every night. I've been suffering ever since. Then why would you come here again? Because Gao Yu told me he would win this prize this time. He said he would marry me. He said everything would be all right. But... she's come back. Yes, she's come back... to seek revenge! Gao Yu. Gao Yu. Don't bother. Yuwei? Yes. She is my sister. Yuwei. We are orphans. We've been living together since childhood. She is my only family in this world. To give me a better future, she worked hard to make money and paid for my education abroad. Just as she thought she had a successful career and found the love of her life. You... all of you... did that abominable thing to her! After Sister fell down the well... she got caught in the vines. But you didn't stop but set fire to the shawl and threw it down. She struggled and struggled. Both her legs were broken. Half of her body... was severely burnt. She went through unimaginable pain, and finally got out of the well. Your sister is out of danger. But the fall... has caused paralysis from the waist down. She was lucky to get caught in the vines, so she survived. However, her face and neck were severely burnt, so she won't be able to talk. She has inhaled a large amount of poisonous substance. I am afraid... the baby in her womb... has not survived. What? My sister is pregnant? The police came. But she didn't say anything. You can try talking to her. Sister. What do you want? Tell me. REVENGE I had been planning... for quite some time. I faked this company test... to gather you all here. Then I tried leading you to the well. The funny thing was... you brought me around in circles. You even came up with nonsense about a ghost wall! By the way... I had been dosing your drinks... with hallucinogen. Have some coffee. Yuwei! All expect for you... they'd been drinking drugged water. Their guilty conscience... had caused their hallucinations. They actually thought they really saw a ghost. How ridiculous it is! So... what about Yang Qian? Don't worry. She's still alive. Ye Nan. I understand how you must feel. You want to seek revenge for your sister. But it's already happened. Don't live in hatred for the rest of your life. Do you know how it feels to lose your family? She is my only family, She is so kind. But these people... has ruined her life. Shouldn't they get their retribution? Ye Nan. Your heart is full of hatred now. It will only hurt whoever loves you most. Love me? The person who loves me most is my sister. But look at her. Look at her condition! I believe she doesn't want to see you like this. Ye Nan. Wonderful things await you in the future. My future was doomed... when they pushed my sister down the well. Now I have none. They've ruined my sister. They've ruined my future. They ruined the person I love the most. I don't want any future. I only want my sister. Ye Nan. Put down your hatred. Don't be blinded by it. You should trust the law. They will get their legal punishment. Don't ruin your life for these people. Sister. All the people who have hurt you are here. What do you want? Tell me. Sister. I know. Ye Nan. Ye Nan. Aren't you a lucky guy? You could even survive that fall. I'm so sorry. Ye Nan. Calm down. Don't make another mistake. You will ruin yourself. It's your turn. Ye Nan. Don't do that. Ye Nan! Listen to me! Ye Nan! Let's end this thing... where it all began. Save... Save... Ya... qi. Save her. I've been living with remorse. I regret that I didn't save her. Shut up. You can drop the act now. I'm giving you the chance to atone for your crime. Stop! Don't come any closer. Ye Nan. Please stop. They committed a heinous crime. If you take their lives like this, you'll be just like them! It's none of your business. I don't believe you've been feigning innocence. You are just blinded by hatred. Ye Nan. Please stop now. Ye Nan. I've ruined both your and Yuwei's life. Actually, I've been living in the shadow of Yuwei, pathetically begging for love. If my death... can free you from hatred... I'm willing to die as my redemption. Wang Bo. Let me go. No, I won't. I will never let go. Sorry. I've used you. I don't deserve your love. Forget me. Ye Nan. Sorry, my flight was delayed. Where's my room? Upstairs. Let me help you. Thanks, but I'm fine. YE NAN EVENTUALLY HASN'T AVENGED HER SISTER IN EXTREME WAYS. SHE HAS TAKEN LEGAL APPROACH TO MAKE THOSE WHO HURT HER SISTER GET THEIR PUNISHMENT GAO YU HAS BEEN CHARGED AND ARRESTED FOR MALICIOUS INJURY. YAQI HAS BEEN CHARGED AND ARRESTED FOR MALICIOUS INJURY. DUE TO HER GULTY CONSCIENCE, YANG QIAN HAS DECIDED TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEM. WANG BO AND YE NAN HAVE SINCE RESIGNED. NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE. It's finally finished. You've been writing this one for a long time. What's the novel about? It's a secret. Honey. Do you have any secret? Me? What secret can I have? Well, what's been going on between you and Ye Nan? Honey! You've worked too hard on the novel. You should get some rest. EVERY WELL YOU SEE AT MIDNIGHT HIDES A SECRET THAT NOBODY KNOWS.
