(sinister music) - Oh! Right here, this is it. Rainbow teddy chews, there's nothing better. - No, these are nasty. - Wrong, they are sweet, sour and adorable! - Kinda like me. - Sometimes. How much longer before we get to your mom's? - Three hours... If we don't stop at every single store that we see. - I'm not here just to buy. Got a bathroom? - Out back, behind the store. - Really? Thank you. - What kind of chips? - Surprise me. (sinister music) (scream) (screams in the distance) (screaming) - Hannah, you are gonna love it, trust me. My first year of college, I was a mess. I had to leave my home, my friends, my family, My little dog, marty. I know how hard it is to say goodbye to all that. - It's just... I'm leaving my whole life behind. - No, honey, your life is just beginning. This is exciting, you will make new friends. You're gonna fall in love with your classes. - I hope so. - Maybe you'll even meet a guy. - Join a sorority? - Oh, well... - Just kidding, mom. (laughing) (sigh) - My hannah, you're all grown up. I'm gonna miss you. - I'll be far away, but like the inscription says, All of my heart. - All of my heart. You know I care. Oh, this is so cute. Ah, let's go! I'll just meet you inside, okay? - Please tell me they sell slushies in there. - Oh, hannah, please choose something a little healthier, will you? - They got strawberry flavour, that's fruit, right? (sigh) Out of order? Ah, man, seriously? Oh, my favourite. - Hannah? Hannah, where are you? Hannah? - She's not here! - Oh, my god! (laughing) - Perhaps I can help you find this hannah of which you speak. - What are you wearing? - They're cool, right? I got you some so that, you know, You can be the coolest mom ever. - Oh, great! - Hum-hum. - Perfect! - Better. - Let's go. - You got a bathroom? - Out back, behind the store. - Honey, are you... Sure you want to use the washroom? I say that with all... Due respect. - I want to? Try have to. I mean, seriously, how bad could it be? - I use it. - Couldn't be worse than the bushes on the side of the road. - Hey, leave... Thank you. Hannah? Hannah, where are you? (startling) geez! - Mom, geez, you're okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Gosh, you scared me. Let's get out of here. - You look good, mom. (laughing) - yeah, well, you look purple. - Sweet. Now, I'm thinking I might be coolest on campus. - Oh yeah? With these three-dollar sunglasses? You're a real trendsetter. That old backpack, seriously? - Uh, yeah. I've had it since the eighth grade, There's no way it's not coming with me. - Okay. (rumbling) - What's that? - I don't know, I think we're gonna have to pull over. Yeah, I'll pull over here. - Well, this kind of sucks. You were right, I should have just flown to school, I would have been there in like three hours. (phone dialling) - you said you wanted to experience Everything that comes with a road trip, so... It's weird. - What? - Nothing, it's fine. - Well, there's no phone signal, So how are we getting someone to fix this? - We're not getting anyone to fix this, I am going to show you, missy, how to change a flat tire. - What seriously? - Yes! Go open the trunk. - Nothing like a road trip. (sigh) Okay, mom, I did not know you could change a tire. - Yeah? Well, there's a lot you don't know about your mother. The good news is now, you know how to change a flat tire. - So, if we break down, you'll teach me how to fix the motor? (laughing) - do not underestimate me, young lady. (tires screeching) (honking) where did he come from? (honking) - maybe you're driving too slow? - No, I'm not. I'm going at the speed limit. (honking) what is he doing? God, is he trying to tell us something? - I can't see in. - Hang on. No, hannah, no. - He's trying to hit us! (tires screeching) mom! This is the one. This is like the sweater. - Hannah, I'm trying to drive. - Just a quick look, it matches the skirt you got me. - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's perfect. - Exactly, green always matches plaid. (engine revving) - It's him. Hannah, sit back, okay? (tires screeching) - What is he doing? Hannah, get on your phone, call 911! - No signal! - Just keep trying! (engine revving) (tires screeching) Where is he going? - I guess he's leaving. - Just hold on, we have got this-- (screams) (crash) (beeps) (moaning) - What... Where am I? - Just relax, miss baker. I'm doctor wilson, you're doing fine. - What happened? - You were in a car accident. - Out on route one, six miles outside of town. I'm nurse ross. - There was a... There was a black car. - You sustained a mild head injury. You'll feel a little light-headed for the next few days. - Oh... How long have I been here? - Two days, But we put you under sedation until your tests were conclusive. X-rays, scans, everything is normal, We just need you to stay here and rest, right now. - We can get you out and back home by the end of the week. - Where... Where am I? - Myerson clinic. - West ridge. You were lucky. - Uh? - We're the only town in the 30-mile radius And the only one with a health facility available. - Is there anyone we can call to come pick you up? - But... Where's my daughter? My hannah baker? - Who? - She would have been in the car with me. - I'm sorry, there was no report of anyone else in the car. - No! My daughter... Hannah, she... - It's okay, just lie back, we'll look into it. - No, no, I have to find her. - Careful. Please, miss baker, you must stay in bed! - No, no! - It's not okay for you to be on your feet. - I need to find her! - It's okay, just lie back. - Miss baker! - Where is my daughter? - Miss baker, please! Please! - Hannah! Hannah! Hannah? Hannah? Hannah! - Miss baker, please. Miss baker! (beeps) - I'm... I'm so sorry. Sorry. - Let's just go back in your room. - I thought that was hannah. Thank you for letting me check out. - Please know, miss baker, that we can no longer Be responsible for you once you leave the facility. - It's fine, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign. - We have a shirt we'd happily loan you. - You're a saint. - And this is the jewelry you were wearing when you came in. - My daughter hannah has the same one. They're matching. - It's very nice. - Thank you so much. - Your belongings from your car are at the sheriff's station. - Oh, is that far from here? - It's about ten blocks, on homestead avenue. We can arrange a ride, if you like. - Yeah, please. - Just be careful. Get some rest when you can, please, And miss baker, good luck. - Oh, thank you. (â™ª) - Miss baker? - Yes. - We do have your purse and suitcase here from your car. We just need you to sign for them, please. - Okay. And was there a backpack? It was pink with, like, a... A turtle? - I'm sorry, this is everything that was in the vehicle. - Oh, okay, hum... If it's okay, I'll just leave my suitcase and grab it after. - Of course. The sheriff will be with you shortly. - Thank you. (sigh) Please answer. Please. (phone ringing) - Hi, it's hannah. Why are you calling? Just text. Thanks! (beep) - Hannah, it's me. Uh... I need you to call me right away And let me know that you are okay, okay, please? Just call me right back as soon as you get this. (sigh) - Miss baker? - Yes. - Sheriff lester. - Hi. I need to report a missing person. - Come in. I'm surprised you're here. - Why wouldn't I be? - According to doctor wilson, You took a pretty hard hit to the head in the accident. You should still be in bed at the clinic. - Yeah, well, I'm not. I'm here and my head is clear, so... The most important thing is finding my daughter, So what happens next? - Well, hum... Black car, that's not a lot to go on. - Yeah, well, it had tinted windows. - Hum, any make? A chevy? Suv? - I'm not very good with car names. - Were there any other cars or trucks? - I can't remember. - Were you near a park? Was there anyone who might have seen what happened? - We were out in the middle of nowhere, All there was road and the woods. - If you have a photo of hannah that you could forward to me, That'd be great. - Here. This is her, my daughter. - Great, email that to us, We'll put it up on our missing persons website. But... You have to understand, miss baker, There was no sign of your daughter at the scene. - Well, she was with me, sheriff. I'm... Not lying. - Hum, I get that, I just think that, hum... You might not be thinking clearly, right now. - I'm not delusional, my head is fine! - Hum... Did you try calling her? - Yes, of course. I've tried calling, I've tried texting And there's been no answer. - She could have run off. - What? Why? - Do you and your daughter get along? - Yes! She's the love of my life! What are you implying? That she would run away at the scene of a crash? - The vast majority of missing persons are runaways. - And where is she gonna go? She's gonna run away into the woods? - She could have hitchhiked. - Sheriff, I was driving my daughter to college, Her first day of freshman year. She couldn't have been happier. This is my daughter, my only family! Sheriff, please. (sigh) - I'll put out an apb. (sigh) we'll go out there, we'll take a look around, We'll talk to everyone. I promise, we'll follow every lead. - Wait... That's it? I mean, can't you round up some people and send out a search party Or like, get her scent and use dogs? - Miss baker, I think the best thing for you right now Would be to get yourself back home. Get rested, let us take care of this. We have all of your information, We'll call you as soon we hear anything. - I am not going anywhere until I find my daughter. - For her safety and the benefit of this investigation, I strongly suggest that you stay out of our way and you let us do our job. (knock-knock) - There you go, sheriff. - Thank you, porter. Your car was dropped off at gus' auto repair. - Where's gus'? - I'll have porter take you there. - See, your hood's all crunched, Side fender is bending into your tire. We'll put her out back a bit, But I mean, your front end is all torqued. - But you can take care of it, right? Like... Because I really need a car. - So you can go and look for your daughter? I heard all about that, I'm so sorry. - How did you find out? - Big news gets around fast in this little town. - Right. - So, we're at least looking at new struts. Not sure what you got going on till we get in there. Long as the parts are in stock, We'll get you on your way in a few days or so. - Few days? (sigh) I'm gonna need a car, Do you have a loaner or something? - We don't really do that here, sorry. - Is there a car rental place around here? - Far as I know, there's a place outside mid-city, They rent cars, old broken-up cars. I mean, it's cheap rates, but they do break down like crazy. - Well, it's not gonna work. Did you find a pink backpack in there? There was like a little turtle patch on it. - Pink backpack... No. You might want to ask gus. He goes through all of the cars as they come in. I just mind my own business and fix them. - What do you mean? - I just do my job, whatever else goes on, It ain't none of my business. - Like what? What goes on? - Jake likes to run off the mouth. Got something to do, jake? - Excuse me. - Gus d'angelo. You must be rachel. - Yeah, I'm rachel baker. Did you find a pink backpack in here? It has like a turtle patch on it. - Nope. Hum... Sorry about what's going on with your daughter. - Her name is hannah. (sigh) - Well, she's pretty. I'll keep an eye out for her, for sure. - Listen, I'm gonna need a car, so... - Well, I wish I could help. Uh... You might ask around over at hilltop. It's always crowded there, Someone might have seen something. - Hilltop? - Yeah, it's a diner. Just down the road. (chuckling) - Here you are, cherry pie, of course. - Kerry, you're a mind reader. (laughing) - Well, it's the only pie you order, so. - This, this is so good. I can have this for dinner, I'm serious. - Yeah. (laughing) Hey, I had a really great time, the other night. - Yeah, me too. Sorry I left early, I had to... Get up and open the motel and-- - yeah, no, it's fine. Hum, mackie's is having two for one drinks tonight, I'm in if you are. - Oh, hum... Not tonight, maybe another time. - Okay, cool. Enjoy. - Thanks. - Hi, excuse me, have you seen this girl? I'm looking for her. She's 18 years old, dark-brown hair. Are you sure you haven't seen her anywhere While you've been driving in the truck? Sorry to interrupt your dinner. Hi, hum, excuse me, I'm looking for my daughter, hannah. Have you seen her? - No, I'm... I'm sorry. She's adorable. I hope you find her. - Thanks, I will. Hi, everyone, excuse me, sir, can I get your attention? Uh... I'm looking for my daughter, hannah. She went missing about two days ago. After a car accident that we were on in route one, She's vanished. If anyone has seen her, she's about my height, She's got dark-brown hair, she's 18 years old. If you see anything or have seen her around town Or have any leads or clues, if you could please, please, Report it to the sheriff's office, I really need your help. Thank you. (â™ª) Thanks for the ride, sheriff, I really appreciate it. - Miss baker, I could arrange to get you some transportation back home. I think it would a good idea you got some rest. - I'm not going anywhere until I find my daughter. I'm staying here. Have a good night, sheriff. - Hi, from the dinner, right? I'm so sorry about your daughter. I'm mark. - Rachel. - Well, it looks like we can get you in the room... 120. - I'd say you can get me in any room. - Yeah, we're not the biggest travel destination here. In the winter, we get skiers on the way to the mountain. Get the odd hunter from time to time. - Well, you'd be happy to know that the sheriff's office Recommended you and said that this place was safe. - Ah, and clean? - Hum... (laughing) - Well, trust me, your room has clean sheets. Oh, and you'll need... These. - What's this? - For my car. You need to get around town, right? So use that as long as you need. Well, as long as I don't need it. - Oh... Hum... Thank you, but no. - I'm not gonna take no for an answer on this, please. - Okay... Thanks. Do you know if there's somewhere I can get some dinner around here? - Well, we do have a 24 hour dining on the premises. - Oh. - Sadly, it's a vending machine. I think the special tonight is cheese crackers. (laughing) - Uh, thanks. I think I'll pass. - Otherwise, at this time of night, your best bet is pizza. Call gino's. - I'll just go with the cheese crackers. - Great choice. Have a nice night. (â™ª) - Cannonball! - Yeah! - Come on, show us your best hassles, mama. - Oh, my darling, should we retire to the veranda for the mint juleps? - Mom, you look so good in that! I look like aunt mimi. - No, honey. - Yerr. - Fits me, right? (laughing) (knocking) (dramatic music) - Oh, hey. Sorry, I didn't want to knock In case you were sleeping. I was just gonna... Call your room, But I felt bad about the vending machine, so I... Got you some gino's. - Thanks. - Have a good night. (sigh) - Rough day? (sigh) - Kid's birthday party almost killed me, today. I'm in serious need of some wine. Mackie's? First round's on me. - Yeah, okay. Sure. - Okay. (laughing) I need a few rounds, actually. Crazy stuff happening, like that woman looking for her daughter, I mean, it's pretty scary. - Yeah, rachel. Her name's rachel. What she's going through it just must be... - Yeah, I'd... I can't even imagine. - She's determined, though. She's a fighter, She's gonna find her, definitely. I'm actually making a missing person's poster for her, so. - Oh... Oh, so you're helping her? - I mean, any way I can. She's staying at the motel. - Yeah, that... That's good. It's good that she's not alone during this time. - Yeah, I think so. She just seems so lost, worried... - Yeah, and you'll keep an eye on her. - Yeah, I mean, if she needs me to, I guess. - Yeah, everyone needs a knight in shining armour. (laughing) - well, I'm not that. - No, not yet. - You okay? - Hum... Yeah, I'm... I'm fine, I just... Anyway, have a nice night. - Wait, hang on, I thought we were going for a drink? - Hum... I'm thinking I'd rather drink alone, tonight. Uh, yeah, thanks anyway. (sinister music) (tires screeching) - come on! Come on! - Just hold on, mommy's here, mommy's here! (screams) (crash) (crying) Hannah! No! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah, where are you! Hannah! (crying) (phone ringing) (startling) Hum, hello? - Good morning, miss baker. - Doctor wilson? - I heard you're still in town, I wanted to check in, See how you're feeling. - Uh, yeah, I-I'm good. - No headaches? - No, hum... No, everything is good, sharp as a tack And all that good stuff. (laughing) - good, good to hear that. If you need any sort of pain meds, even aspirin, Anything, I'm here. - Thank you. - I can get prescriptions waiting for you At your local pharmacy if you need me to. - Hum no, I'm... I'm still here. I'm staying at the bear manor. My daughter, she's still-- - yes, of course. I'm so sorry. We do have an outstanding sheriff's department searching for her, So if you feel like you need to get home, Get some rest. - No, thank you. - Got it. Please call me if you need anything. - I'm not leaving until I find her. Thank you, doctor wilson. You wanted to see me? - Oh, hey. Good morning. - Morning. - I made some coffee. It is a little muddy but will get your day started. - Hum, thanks. (printer whirring) What's happening over there? - Oh, right. This... For hannah. You know, put them up around town kind of thing. - Where did you get this picture? - Oh, uh... What you call it? The sheriff's missing person website thing, you know? - Hum, oh yeah, you weren't kidding. That is muddy. - Yeah, told you. Okay, so let's start at the beginning. - Why don't we start right here? Why are you doing this? - Well, I said I wanted to help and I meant it. - Okay, I appreciate that, but-- - Look, truth is... I understand what you're going through. I have a daughter, she's 18, kristen. I haven't seen her in two years. - I'm sorry. - I miss her a lot, but it's... It's complicated. It's kind of the reason I'm here, actually. You know, get away from it all, unplug, You know, find myself. - So you bought a motel? - Yeah, well actually, I inherited it. - Oh. - It wasn't really in my life plan, but... Follow the green lights, right? - Yeah, sure. - Oh, you're gonna need this. - Thanks. One step at a time, right? - That's right. - Sheriff lester. I'm going to need some help hanging these posters around town. A photo on a website is not going to do much. - Miss baker, I'm sorry, but hanging posters Is not the best use of my resources. - Can you call in some backup? - Can't bring assets into our jurisdiction, right now. Trust me, we can manage. We'll contact you as soon as any information comes in. You just, you have to sit tight, please. - Sit tight? I am the mother of a missing girl, I am not gonna sit tight! This is not a lost cat or a missing puppy. - Yes, I understand that, and if you want to help, We have a bulletin board in the lobby where you can post pertinent information, But the best thing for this investigation right now Would be for you to trust us and let us handle it. (sigh) man. (â™ª) (knock-knock) - excuse me, doctor wilson? - Yes. - On my way back in from lunch, I found this in our parking lot. - Looks familiar. - It's miss bakers', she was wearing it when we took her in. - Hum, that's right. - I'd like to contact her and return it, But her information is not in our data bank. - Hum, strange. I have her number here, somewhere. - Oh, the inscription is so sweet! "always in your heart," I love that. That's weird, "with love, mom." So is this her daughter's bracelet? - Or perhaps, rachel got it from her mother. - Hum, no, it's got to be her daughter's. She said they each have matching bracelets. I got to get this to her right away. She'll want the sheriff to know we found this. - The sheriff's office is on my way home, I can drop it off. - I think it'd be better if I just give it to her And let her decide what to do with it. - Absolutely. She's staying in bear manor, I'll get that number for you. - Okay. (â™ª) (beeps) (sigh) - seriously? We can't take it. - No luck? - No, and when I got back to the car, there was a note on it That said it's not safe to be here and I should be careful. I don't know if someone is actually threatening me Or if they're trying to warn me. - Well, whatever it is, someone certainly wants you out of town. - Yeah, everyone seems to want me out of town, But whoever left that note has to know where hannah is. She has to be here, right? - We should take that to the sheriff. - No, I'm not going to the sheriff. He's... - What? What's wrong? What's going on? - That guy, hum... From the store. - What store? - When hannah and I were driving on route one, We stopped at a store and he worked there. He's over in the corner, have you ever seen him before? - No, I don't think so. Why, what are you worried about? - I don't know, there's just something about him, he just seems really off. - Well... I mean, he seems a little off, Maybe he's just a weird dude. - No, the whole store had this really weird vibe And after that, that's when the black car started following us. - From the store? - No... But when my car stopped, I realized that my tire was slashed. It's all making sense. - Slashed? Seriously? - Yeah, and it had to have happened there Because that is the only place that hannah and I stopped. It's just, why would he be in town? It can't be a coincidence. - Well, hang on, if he's part of it, he's involved, a bad guy, Why would he come to the middle of the town where everyone can see him? - I don't know, maybe he's hiding in plain sight. - Okay, well, if that's the case, How do you know I'm not the bad guy? (laughing) - well you, I mean, could be, but At least, you're a helpful bad guy. - Yeah, right. Hey, kerry, I'd like to order please. - Yeah. - Two sandwiches, that's it. - That's the lunch menu, were on dinner, now. - There's 30 minutes left on lunch. - Sorry. Do you need another minute? I'll be right back. - Okay. - What was that about? (sigh) - don't ask. (â™ª) (phone dialling) - Oh, shoot, you're not there. Miss baker, it's grace from doctor wilson's office. I found your bracelet, at least, I think it's yours, it's weird. Anyway, come by the office tomorrow Or stop by my place today, I'm nearby at 4284 willow street. (car start-up) (â™ª) Binky? Mommy's home! (calling) Where are you, kitty? Are you hungry? Is that you, binky? Kitty cat? Are you hungry? Mommy's got some food for you, it's liver. Sorry, baby, it's all they had. (distant moaning) Where are you, binky? Kitty cat. (meowing) oh, there you are! What's up with you, uh? (laughing) binky! What's up, crazy cat? I got your food for you. I know it's liver, but come on. Yeah. What's up, baby? (scream) (phone notification) - Finally. (phone dialling) (beep) - Miss baker, it's grace from doctor wilson's office. (static, garbled voice) (â™ª) (croaking) (knocking) - grace? Hello? (knocking) grace? (phone dialling) Grace, it-it's rachel, I'm at your house. I'm... You don't seem to be here, though. Maybe you're busy? Hum... I guess I'll come by the office tomorrow. Call me back. (meowing) (â™ª) (meowing) Grace? Hello? (dramatic music) Grace, are you in there? Hello? Grace? Grace! Oh my god! Grace. - A murder is the last thing I'd expect to see in this town. - Am I done here? Can I go? - I just need to know, miss baker, why were you here tonight? - She left me a message and said that there was something She wanted to give me. - What was it? - I don't know, the voicemail kept breaking up. - But yet, you had to get here and get it tonight, So you must have thought it was important, But you have no idea what it is. - She said she was gonna be here And that I should pop by and pick it up. - Hum-hum. I thought you couldn't hear the message. - Well, not all of it, it was breaking up. - Hum, what else can you tell me about your relation with grace? - My relationship? I hardly know her. - Well, why were you so angry with her? - What? - According to doctor wilson, You were very hostile towards her when you met her At the hospital. - Hostile? I had just found out that my daughter is missing And they wouldn't let me out of the hospital. I was upset. What is it you're asking me, sheriff? Am I on trial, here? - I'm just gathering details on what's going on with everyone involved. - Involved? I'm not involved. - Oh, you're very involved. - That doesn't even-- - This could have something to do with your missing daughter. I just don't know. Maybe nurse ross knew something that you didn't want her to know. - What, so sheriff, you think that I'm a suspect? You're trying to connect me to my own daughter's disappearance? - All I'm saying, miss baker, is that we're following up on every lead, Just like I promised you. - Am I done now? - For now. I'd say don't leave town, but I know you won't. - That's right, I won't. - That's right, you won't. - What did grace have that she wanted to give me? It must have been something to do with hannah, right? I mean, maybe she knew something. Maybe she knew too much. Did I do this, mark? Did she die because of me? - No, don't go there. Okay, you need to keep together, for hannah. - Right. Yeah, right. (panting) I just miss her so much. (sad music) We were gonna spend the day together. You know, decorate her dorm room. She was gonna show me around campus. Her major's in fashion design. She has this ability to... Take colours and patterns and blend them together. She could take any piece of clothing And take it down to the seams and create a whole new tailored outfit. She's super smart, strong, God knows she had to be. She lost her dad when she was really young. (sigh) he was a cop. He got killed during a routine burglary check... Got ambushed. - I'm sorry. - Hannah was only five. You don't realize how much we rely on each other. It was just me and her figuring out life. No parent should ever be in this position, It's just... It's not right. - This is my daughter, kristen. - Oh, she's adorable. - She's going to college in florida. She's studying to be a vet. - Hum. - When she was young, she would always... Help wounded birds And foster lost dogs. It's always been a natural thing for her. - Whatever happened with you guys? - Her mother, my ex, turned her against me. - What? Why? - She wasn't too happy when she found out I had a girlfriend. - Oh, I can understand that. - I mean, we were split up, we weren't even living together. She lied to kristen about me, said some bad things and... Kristen was a kid, she believed it. Our relationship never recovered. - Yeah, but she's older now, I'm sure if you reached out to her, she would understand. - It's tricky, because now, I feel like I'd be Turning her against her mother and I don't want that. (chuckles) - yeah, but... She's your daughter. She may need you... Now that she's in college And starting her life. - Right. - Mark, hello. - Doctor wilson. - You know my wife, jenny. - Of course. Hi. - Mark. - Hello, rachel. Jenny, this is rachel baker, My patient I was telling you about. - It's so nice to meet you. - Hi. - I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. - I'm really sorry for what you guys are going through, too. I mean... From what I knew of grace, she seemed Like a really sweet soul. - She was like family. - It's a... Very difficult time. I'll close the clinic for a few days, We're headed out to our place in the lake. We feel best to get away for a few days. - We're heartbroken, as you can imagine. - Of course, yeah. - It was really nice to meet you, rachel. - And please, try to take it easy. - Will do. - The sheriff's department's never had to deal With anything like this. Hope they don't blow it. What? - I just had this... Stupid idea. I'm going to take a look around and see If I can find what grace had for me. (intriguing music) - Hi! - Hi, I just... I'm just here to feed the cat And it won't take long, I promise. I'll be quick. Thank you. I'll be right back. (camera clicks) Oh, uh... Hi, I'm just here to feed the cat. I'll be really quick. (camera clicks) (sinister music) Here, kitty, kitty. (meowing) Here, kitty, kitty. (â™ª) (sinister music) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (dog barking) - Quiet! Who's there? (suspenseful music) (sigh of relief) - I saw it, sheriff, It was right there! It was right in front of me. - Under a tarp. - Yes, under a tarp. I... Well, I peeled it back, but there was a black car. It had a dented back fender, what more do you need to know? - I know you trespassed. - Oh, come on, sheriff. Please, go down to the barn and see for yourself. - I'm sorry, gus, but I'm gonna have to ask you to open it. - Yeah, not without a warrant. - See, sheriff? He doesn't want you to go in there, Why don't you ask him why? - I don't have to open nothing on my property, It's my fourth amendment right! - Yeah. Hold on, gus, I can get a warrant, I just don't want this dragging on. Now, if you'd open it, I'd really appreciate it. - Yeah, I don't think I have to, so... - Ok, fine, I'll call it in. I issue a warrant, We can all stand around here And wait till the station brings it over. So what's it gonna be, gus? Now or later? - This ain't right. There you go! - What? No... The black car, it was here, I swear, I... - Was there a car here, gus? - If I got no room down at the garage, I'd leave them here, Especially if there was a long wait for parts. - No, it was the car in the crash, I know it! (scoffs) I saw it! I was here. - You know what she's talking about? - It was a 2019 buick waiting on a new battery. I brought it home today, connected it up, The owner showed up and drove it off! - He's lying, sheriff. I know it was the car, without a doubt. - Sheriff, do I have to stand here And listen to her make things up all day? - You can't trust him! - Okay, that's enough, both of you. And miss baker, you said you lifted up a part of the tarp. You didn't see the whole car, is that correct? - No... I lifted enough of it! I know it was the vehicle, sheriff. - Okay, we got nothing here. - Then maybe you can explain to me why was his business card In nurse ross's purse at the murder scene! (laughing) - it might have to do With the fact that she was getting her car Repaired at my shop on Tuesday. - And you left a note on the back that said she was in trouble? - Yeah, she was. She was getting a new transmission. You know, for all the good work she's done for the community, I told her that we'd work something out. - Miss baker, how'd you know it was in her purse? (sigh) You're under arrest. - What? For what? - Trespassing for start And obstructing an investigation. Let's go. - Yeah, watch your head. - That's enough, gus. (car starting) - You can't do this. - Oh, I can, but I'm not. This is a warning. You have to stay out of my investigation and out of my way! - She's my daughter, sheriff, I have every right to look for her. - Yes, you do, but if you don't stay in your lane, You're going in a cell. I'm very serious about this, you got it? - Yes, I've got it. - Look, miss baker, I understand what you're going through. Honestly, I do, But you need to trust us. We have a process, We're doing everything we can to find your daughter. - Jake! Did the struts come in? - Not yet, we got the mounts, But the struts should be in any day. - Okay, as soon as they get here, I want you on it. - Yes sir. But, gus, the car that she hit, It was black, right? - Yeah, that's what I'm hearing. Why? How do you know that? - If you look real close at the bumper, You can see black paint scraped in there. - Yeah, you can just buff that out. - Thing is, you can learn a lot about paint By just looking at it. I mean, you can tell it was charcoal black number 33. - Okay, hold on. You know that just eyeing it? - Yep, only a couple manufacturers have used it In the last 10 to 12 years. - Geez, jake, you never cease to amaze me. - I know it's none of my business, But if they really want to find that car, They can scrape some of the paint off, Send it to a lab in seattle, couple days later, They email you the exact model, year, factory it was built at. - Okay, I get it, I get it. - It'll get the sheriff a lot closer to finding that car and the owner. - That's the whole csi thing. (chuckles) - yeah, like the tv show, yeah. - Yeah, it's a good information to know, jake. Tell the sheriff. Good job. - Thank you. (soft music) (car starting) (intriguing music) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) - You, who are you? Where is my daughter? (gun clicks) - I think you need to go. - Where is she? Do you have her? - Lady, I don't have your daughter. - Then why are her sunglasses in your car? Where did you find those? - We sell the damn things. (sigh) - Please, just... Can you please just put that gun away? The nurse... Nurse ross, did you do that? Was that... Was that you? - Lady, are you drunk? Nurse what? - Why did you break into that clinic? Right. Yeah. I was never here. (screams) (sobs angrily) (sigh) Hello? Mark, are you here? I have your keys. Hello? Are you here? (bell dings) - You need to stay away from him. - Stay away from who? - You have no idea what you're getting into. - I'm not getting into anything. - Oh, really? You and mark, it's nothing? Why do you think he handed his car over to you And set you up in a room? - What? - He is gonna do whatever it takes To get whatever he wants. - And what is it that he would want? - Just trust me, okay? You have a lot going on, right now. - Hey, uh... Kerry? Why are you here? - I was just about to give your new girlfriend a heads-up. - Okay. - What is she talking about? - Nothing, just... Nothing. Can you please go? - Oh, I'm leaving. Rachel... Be careful. - Okay. Kerry, please. All right, bye. That's nothing, it's just between her and I, it's... - It's what? - Okay, so, we're friends, Right? We met at the dinner, we started hanging out... A lot and then one night, we went out and kinda... ...You know, got together. - So now, I'm... Somehow in between your relationship? - No, we're not... We're not in a relationship, That's the whole point of what I'm trying to get at. We're just friends, we're not even dating. - She's clearly fighting for you, mark. - Great, awesome. Nice one, mark. (crickets chirping) (sighs) (sinister music) (intriguing music) (phone ringing) - Hannah? - Mom, help me! - Hannah! - He's... Mom! - Hannah, where are you? - Help me! - What are you doing? Give me that! (screaming) - hannah! No! No! (knocking at door) - rachel? You ok? - Mark! - What... What's going on? - Mark, oh my god, she tried to call me. The... It's her. - Okay, okay, okay. Um... Let me think, let me think. What did she say? Did you hear anything else? - There's a man and he's screaming And he was threatening her and he knows where I am, mark. He knows my every move, but she's here, mark! She's here! - Okay, okay. We're gonna to find her, ok? (phone dialling) (phone tone ringing) - Who are you calling? (panting) - Now that this is officially a kidnapping, My team will be looking through every shed, shack and garage In a 15-mile radius. - Thank you, sheriff. - She's alive, that's the good news. - Yes, and... She's strong, I know her. - Of course. Good night. - Good night, sheriff. (door opens) Hey, he's gonna find her. - Okay. - Okay? You should get some rest. - Thank you. It's been such a stressful, crazy night. - Yeah, crazy. - Yeah, I should probably go. - This is your... Room. - Right, yeah. - Yeah. - I'll go. Yeah. Yeah. (sigh) Hey. - Coffee? - Sure, yeah. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. - Last night, at the motel, that... - Listen, it's my fault. I've been in a weird place. Since my divorce, it's just... - No, no, no.

(phone dings) (phone dinging) (sinister music) - Oh, god. (phone dinging) (dramatic music) Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Hannah! (panting) (phone notification beeps) Show your face! Come out right now! You coward! I'm right here! Show yourself right now! Hannah! (crying) hannah! Hannah! (screaming): Hannah! (sighs) (intriguing music) (car starting) (indistinct radio chatter) - Morning, gus. - Sheriff? - You got a minute? - A minute's all I got, jake didn't show up. - Yeah, I got some bad news, gus. - All right. - It's jake, he's dead. - What... What happened? - His car went off into a ditch on calumet hill. It looks like an accident, there was no signs of foul play. I guess his brakes just went off. (sigh) dammit, dammit! I told him To get those fixed! I mean, the poor guy cared more About other people's cars than his own. - Gus, uh... Did he ever talk to you about that missing girl? - No, not... Not really. - He never mentioned that he saw her, nothing like that? - No, if he did, he'd say something. - Or would he? - Okay, hold on a second. Are you saying that jake Was in on something with this missing girl? - We don't know exactly what's going on, right now. - And now, he's a suspect? How is that even possible? - I can't get into the details of that right now. How did he seem, lately? Was he distracted? Preoccupied? Was there any kind of strange behaviour? (laughing) - well, strange behaviour Was jake's middle name. - Yeah... Did he ever give you an indication That he was capable of violence? - Violence? - Yeah. - I don't know, I mean... He was a mighty fine mechanic and all, But he could be a little weird, at times. I mean, you know him. - Hmm. - You... You think he took the girl? (knock-knock) - sheriff? - Yes, miss baker. Please sit. - You wanted to talk to me? - Yeah, we think we might have a break in your daughter's case. - What? Where... Where is she? - Hold on, we don't know yet. First... Sadly, jake from gus' garage was killed In an unfortunate car accident. - What happened? - His brakes went out and his car went off a ridge. But... First, I need to make sure. Is there any way that you and hannah could have had Any sort of encounter with jake before you came to town? - No. No... What are you asking me? - Hum... Miss baker, jake was a suspect. - Jake? No way. Where did you find this? - At the crash site. - Jake had it? - In the trunk. - Did he take her? - At this point, it's very likely. (sigh) - I mean, what do we do? We still need to find her. - I'm sorry, miss baker, but... If jake was indeed The kidnapper, we may never know what happened to your daughter. - Thank you, sheriff. (birds chirping) (sinister music) (phone vibrates) This is rachel. (indistinct radio chatter) - Miss baker. I'm sorry. - What happened? - Apparently, she fell From the cliff and suffered a fatal spine injury. - Was it an accident? - Well, that's yet to be determined. Are you ready to see her? - Yeah, I'm ready. (sighs) - Miss baker, first, you should know that her face Was disfigured in the fall and she's been laying here For some time, that's why we need you to identify her. (sigh) If you want, we can wait to take this back to the morgue. - No, no, I'm ready. That's not hannah. It's not her, sheriff. (intriguing music) (phone ringing) This is rachel. - Miss baker, this is sheriff lester. You need to exit your room immediately. - What's happening? - You are not safe, Exit the room. - Well, not until you tell me! - Mark is now a suspect In the murder of miss ross And the kidnapping of your daughter. - Mark? What? Are you sure? - We got an anonymous tip, we went to his apartment And we found your daughter's bracelet. He is at large, considered dangerous, Possibly armed and he might be on the premises. You need to get out of that room. - Gus! What are you doing here? - We're gonna go for a little ride... We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way. - Mark! (groaning) (dramatic music) - Stop! Stop it! You're gonna kill him! - That's the idea. Come on! Get out of here, go! - Mark! (crickets chirping) (intriguing music) - Rachel, welcome to our home. - Doctor wilson? What... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch out for her, She's feisty. (clears throat) - I have to say, I've been watching you around town, Your perseverance is impressive. I'm sorry it's come to this, It's a glitch I wasn't anticipating. - Where is hannah? Where is she? - First, I wanna say thank you. You have helped jenny and I immensely. - Just tell me what is going on, here. (clears throat) - Over a year ago, we lost our lovely teenage daughter, Megan, in a tragic car accident. For jenny, the grief was unrelenting. The grip of loss was strangling her. It looked like I was gonna lose her as well, So I was forced to make a bold move. I hired gus to wait in the outskirts of town To find the perfect replacement for our megan. - Oh yeah, the second I saw her... (laughing) I knew that was exactly what you're looking for. - So you just... Took her? Like a stray cat? No! No, this is not happening. Hannah, where are you? Hannah, I'm here! (shushing) - it's okay. Rachel, please know that ever since We have taken her into our lives, Jenny has found purpose. She's quite happy that once again, She has a complete family. - Tell me that she's okay. - Don't worry, she's fine. - Yeah, just like the dead girl in the woods? You did that, right? - No! No! I will not be responsible for what happened to her. She became the victim of an unfortunate accident When she escaped from our home. - So what do you want from me? - Hannah means everything to jenny and me. And you were getting too close to the truth. You were putting my family at risk, so unfortunately, Like grace and jake and now, your friend mark, I have to dispose of you. - You will never get away with this. - In this town, you'd be surprised What you can get away with. (laughing) - Why am I here, then? Why didn't you just kill me in the first place? - Because first, I wanted to make sure that you understood How important your sacrifice is to our family. - Rachel. I know, this is so very strange, but please understand That your daughter will have an amazing life with us, Far beyond anything you could offer her as a single mother. - Just let me say goodbye to her. - Hmm, it could ruin the bond we've started. - No, please, just think for a minute What that would have been like if you were able To say goodbye to megan, if you just had one more moment with her, To say goodbye to her as parents. Please, I just... I need that, I want that, with my daughter. - In truth, your blessing could help her through this period of transition. - Over time, she'll learn to love us as her actual parents. - Mom! - Hannah! - As her parents, now, at this point in the process, It's best that you two keep your distance. - Mom, don't let them keep me here. - Hannah, there's nothing I can do. - Mom! - You're in much better hands Now that you're with your father and I, I promise you. - Shut up, you're not my mother, you're a psycho! - Do not talk to your mother that way. How many times do I have to tell you? Apologize. - Don't leave me. - Apologize. - I'm sorry. - Sorry, what? - Sorry, mom. - Hannah, look at me. You are strong, you'll get through this. Your life is here, now. - What? - There's nothing else I can do, I'm sorry. - You're leaving me? - Please, can I... Give her one last hug? Please. Hannah. Run, hannah! (screams) (dramatic music) (screams) - Gus, grab her! - Where are you going? Where are you going? That's a bad move! Bad move! (screams) game over! Game over! - No! - Game over! Go! (laughing) (screams) (groaning) (screams) - mom! - You ruined everything. God, I should have killed you day one. - Do what you want with me, as long as hannah is free From here and can live her life! - She'll never get out of here, trust me. - Jenny, behind you! - Mom! - Hannah! (groaning) (screams) (panting) - We would have such a wonderful life. You, me, your mother. You were to have everything you could ever dream of, but now, it all ends here. - Do not hurt her! - It'll quick and painless, I promise. (screams) (groaning) (screams) I am not afraid to do this! Hannah, call 911! (dramatic music) (panting) (phone ringing) - Mark, hey! - You're gonna do great, hanna. - After everything that's happened, I'm ready for whatever college has in store for me. - Hey, mark, good luck on the new job. - Had to do it, couldn't stay in that town any longer. - The hotel looks really nice. And florida, it suits you, you'll fit right in there. - Well, it's not my dream job, but I'm close to my daughter And that's all that matters. - Yeah, and I'm so glad that you guys are trying, But be aware, the parent-child relationship is never easy. - Mom, seriously! I am not a child! - See what I'm saying? - Hannah, good luck! I know you're gonna kick butt in school. - I'm ready. - Good to hear from you, mark. (soft music) I am gonna miss you so much, hannah. I'm so proud of you. - I'm gonna miss you more, mom. - That's impossible. - This might help. - What, seriously? - I'm letting go of a little bit of me and giving it to you. You should have it, just until you stop missing me so much. - Oh! I love you, sweetheart. - I love you more. Uh... Mom? I'm gonna have to go. - No! I've changed my mind, I don't ever want to let you go. (laughing) Okay, fine. Bye, my love. I love you! (laughing) I'm gonna miss you. (soft music) Subtitling: Difuze
