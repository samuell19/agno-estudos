[Music] [Music] It's really pretty simple. You just close your eyes, turn your head and lean on. It's not supposed to be that hard, Henry. Are you sure you want to do this ? - It's all I think about... like... literally and I don't want to look unexperienced. - It might take a Christmas miracle. I'm just teasing. You're gonna do fine. Let's try again [Music] - What date did General Winfield Scott's forces take the Mexican capital ? - What day Henry ? Come on you know this one. - 1847 - How do you do that ? - It just sticks in his brain. There's something once and is there forever. - So when are you gonna tell dad ? - Honey please, just stop. I mean he's never gonna let you go on the date anyway. - Okay got it. - Got it, Henry, the date...? - September 14th, 1847 - You're amazing. - Amazing, bud. Your first date. Awesome. All right, 7:00 p.m. Friday. I'm driving you and the little lady - If you're asking Santa for help ? - I think it's wonderful. - It's asking for trouble - A little magic might just be what this date needs. [Music] - It's a bit stupid to be here. [Music] - Because he'd know if I took more than one. - No, he wouldn't. Your dad is so understanding, believes everything you say. - And is hot. - You see why I wanna keep it that way. - What about Louisa ? - Hey kid, what the hell are you looking at ? You know if you brought your little brother and sister, you have to go see them, you've got to stay with them till it's their turn - Yeah! You can't just leave them in there. This isn't like a place where you leave kids. - Day care - Yeah, a daycare, this is like a day care. - Seeing Santa can be very traumatizing for some kids - Ladies - Oh, I'm sorry. - There you are. - What? I'm... - My boyfriend of course. I know who you are. -Just go on and pretend that happens. - Incredible... To bring over that. They issue a very specific list of the games. Are you sure you don't want a Megatron or a velociraptor then. - No Michael. Let's go. Say goodbye to Santa - Bye Santa. - Henry Hi, it's young Henry Murphy It's been a few years since you've come to see Santa, eh ? Did something happen ? Everything is okay ? - Yes Santa, everything's good. - Mom is okay ? - Okay. - Oh well. What would you like Santa to bring you this year ? - Hey kid, you can't cut the line. - Just give the guy a second - Sorry son. Your mom and I got you the bike. So sure that you've seen it in the garage. - I know. I'm here to ask for something else, for someone else. - All right! Well, that's very thoughtful of you young man and who's this present for ? - My dad - Okay... - You see... my dad is missing out on a really big part of his son's life, my life and I really want to give that to him for Christmas this year and I think if I could talk about it with him, he and I would be close like we used to be. - I think he'd like that very much - I'm not sure he will. - Hello there, what's your name ? - Heather, Heather Mc Crystal - Well, hello Heather Mc Crystal and you must be Caroline. - Oh, I'm Sarah, Heather sister. - Oh, I'm sorry of course, Sarah Mc Crystal, Henry's new girl... - Dad, she's not my girlfriend. - Yes, I am the girlfriend. - It's okay son...no need to be shy. - I'm not being shy. - Santa's your dad ? - I'm gay. - You're not. - Santa... - Everybody smile [Music] - Well, who is ready for the Santa's presents ? - Mom, please, we know. - Know what ? That now that you two're teenagers and Santa is a very busy man... mom and dad have to help him out a little bit - Shut up Connie. - Language Henry - Sorry I think that Santa got almost everything that everybody wanted this year. - Can we open them up at the same time, right ? One, two, three... Oh my god! The iPhone X. Thank you mom and dad. - And Santa. - Thank you guys...I mean Santa. So much. This is really amazing. - Oh, you know what? I think Santa has something for mom and dad too. - Santa has very good taste. You didn't have to do that. - Dad, open yours. - That is exactly what I wanted. [Music] [Music till the end]
