In collaboration with Presents Produced by Script and Dialogue Producers Based on the Book by THE OUTLANDER A film by (dog whining) (dog whining) (barking) (knocking) - Come in! - Good evening to you. I've been walking a while. If you feed me, I'll chop that wood for you. - Night's coming. Chopping's gonna be difficult. - Pull up a chair, Outlander. - First I'm gonna scrape off the dirt. - Around here, it's "scrape the pig." (quiet laugh) - Be careful! You'll break it. - You expect him to eat off the table, Phonsine? What are you waiting for? - We're not gonna serve you. - That's good tea. Just like the lumber camp's. - Are you a Woodsman? What's your name? ' My name? You just gave me one: the Outsider. - Not the Outsider. I said "Outlander." - Outlander... That's fine by me. - Here. It's getting chilly. - Don't bother. I have everything I need, little mother. - Don't say that. I don't have any children yet. - They'll come when it's time. (chicken cackling) (horse neighing) - Move it, Amable! We gotta finish that stack before noon. - He can write. (coughing) - Want me to take over? - You try it then. ' Ow! (dog barking) - Young'un, I'd have liked to go head to head with you 30 years ago. - I was still in my crib back then. (laughing) - Shoot! - For God's sake! You're done for already? At his age, I could've jumped over that barn! - Maybe he's got a sickness. - Nah! He was born that way. - Amable... - Giddy up, Outlander! - Who's that man? - Just an outlander. Another stray dog my father took in. - It's still a pretty good dog. - Sweet Jesus! My husband... Come here. Really, Amable... What were you thinking? I told you to be careful, didn't I? Why didn't you stop before you got woozy? - The old man was fit to be tied this morning. - Is he far from home? - The man? I think so. He's not like us. And... I found a bunch of weird stuff in his pack. He's got this black knife. It looks like wood, but it's as hard as iron. And he has pictures... - You searched his pack, Phonsine? - Well.. He won't say anything. - He has a right to his secrets, like the rest of us. - A man who jumps to work like that... That's not normal. - Lucky for us he's just a migrant bird. Hmm... Feeling better, Amable? - I'm okay! - Are you gonna be staying awhile, Outlander? - I like it here. Some food and a place to sleep, that's all I need. - You're big and strong... There's the look of an island about you. You remind me of my younger son, Ephrem... May he rest in peace. But the harvesting's done. There's little work left. - The road's nearby. I'll move on. - I didn't ask you to leave by sunset. - Hey! That was Cournoyer. He just sold his catch in Sorel. - The Beauchemins have a stranger in the house. - Yeah? What's he doing there? - He's working. - Didace doesn't need a hand at this time of year! - I've never seen anything like it. His hair's like wildfire. - Could be a Highlander. - Could be. I hear he won't tell his name. - Didace should be careful. - I didn't see him properly, but... he looks honest. - In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... - Giant flowers, with colours you don't see in these parts. Blood red or purple, like plums. The trees have huge leaves, bigger than ferns. And their fruit is about this big. Like wooden balls filled with milk. - Did you see the look he gave us? - You're like Big Gerry from Maska, uh? He says he saw a da-nosaur stick its head out of the river, had a neck the size of a mast! (all laughing) - Don't believe in what you haven't seen, Odilon? - Why should I? - Well said! - Do you think I could serve some dandelion wine, Mrs. Provengal? We haven't had visitors in so long! - You've been in mourning for a year now? I see no harm in it, my girl. (knocking) - Come in! - There's the gimp. - Don't be mean. if you had land, my brother would've married you by now. - Serves him right if his kids have club feet. - What a surprise! The fair Angélina. - Maybe she's getting more sociable. - I brought Phonsine some bobbins. I didn't mean to intrude. - Did you use scented soap? I can smell the geraniums from here! - Leave her alone, Beau-Blanc-De-Froi. - I was just making her feel welcome, Mr. Beauchemin. - Sit down, Angélina. - Thank you. - You brag about crossing the sea, Outlander, but what about your origins? - Here and there. - You had to be born somewhere. - I bet you can play music, Outlander. I see it in your eyes. - Looks like he can do it all. - There's an harmonium at Angélina's place. - Ah... - Bedette! No. - Father... - Do you play the harmonium, Miss Angélina? - I haven't used it since my... mother died, 15 years ago. - That's too bad. - You won't be able to show off all your skills. - Go on, Outlander! Those faraway people, are they the same as us? - I've seen dark-skinned warriors no taller than my waist... Miss Angélina. Is it too late to see your harmonium? - You're not serious? It's past nine. - I'll walk you home. It's late. You're not afraid of the dark? - Who'd bother me? - Why do you say that? - Are you blind, Outlander? - There's no shame in being different. The world's beautiful because all birds don't look the same, or fly in the same pattern. - The Church itself won't take a cripple. I wanted to become Sister Sacristan, and see to the flowers... - You're much too bright-eyed for that! - Don't worry about it. She's way too stubborn. That piece of human flotsam won't get the better of you. - Not unless she's lost her mind. - Do you like music, Angélina? - I used to love it. I sang hymns with my mother. - I don't know much about Church music. - If you read them aloud, the words... the words make their own music. - It's like the stranger can read our souls, Mother. - Outlander! Amable! Outlander! It's a cloud of ducks! The sky's so dark it's downright scary! - Can't wait to see it! - Don't get your hopes up. He won't let you shoot. You'd think God himself gave him that gun, the way he treats it! - Do you ever hunt, Amable? - Bad enough I get up at the crack of dawn every day, don't ask me to freeze my ass off too! - They're coming in flocks. Wait till you see it, Outlander. They're all over the sky! - That wood won't stack itself. Don't waste time ogling my father. - Mm-hmm... Smells good. (whistling) _ My cup! That's my cup! You're gonna break it! It's not right! I won it! At the fair. It's mine. - A fella can't touch anything around here. The old man has his armchair, the young one's got his rocker and the little mother's got her cup... - Stop saying that! - Don't worry about it. Let Nature take its course. - What's going on? - Nothing. (knocking) - Good evening, Miss Angélina. When I go to Rio The rum always tastes good She just grabs my heart sailor And scrubs my deck... But right in Brest There's a burgess No wine no rum not even beer Will make me forget Her sweet candy... The bur-barb sweet candy The bur-barb sweet candy The burgess's sweet candy The bur-barb sweet candy The bur-barb sweet candy The burgess's sweet candy - Harmoniums are kind of slow. On a piano, you can start or stop the sound at will. - Our instrument isn't used to your silly songs. - Do you know any slow music? - Ah... - See... It's getting late. - Sure. Good night to you, Mr. Desmarais. - Same to you, young man. - You can come back. Don't be shy. - Ahem... - Why did you visit the Desmarais on courting night, you blasted Outlander? - No need to go courting to drop in on your neighbours. If you wanted in, you should have knocked. - You have some nerve to eye Angelina in your situation! - I'll play the harmonium whenever I please. - Go strut elsewhere or you'll have to deal with me. - Don't worry, Odilon. Everyone knows you're the rooster in these parts. - Yeah. And don't you forget it. Anyway, you're wasting your time. Old man Desmarais will never leave his land to some nameless outcast. - His land? That's what you're after, Odilon? - Beauty's no object... for a woman of property. - I don't intend to stay, Provengal, but get out of my way. - I'm cleaned out! How am I gonna pay for the room? - Paying for the room's the least of your worries! - Give Yéniche your cross and I'll settle the bill. - Acadian! - You won't be sorry, Red. - This one's on the house! - You're the sailors' own Virgin Mary, Acadian! - That's no way to talk about my late husband! - The girl come with me. - Leave her alone! She's with me! - That's enough! - Amable, move it. - I'll be jiggered! You have the nerve to show up in that state, Outlander? - What happened to you? Did you meet one of them highwaymen? - Not too many bandits between here and Sorel. They prefer the hotel. - It'll bring down the swelling... - Never mind. - You better be able to do a full day's work. - I'll be steady... if Phonsine feeds me. - Phonsine. - Take mine in the meantime. - There's not enough work for three men on our land. And nothing for a bawdy fellow riddled with vices. - There's not much wrong with you, Amable, save that you care for nothing beyond your own ease. You clipped your wings like an ant that found its hidey-hole. - So? What good's flying when you're settled and safe? The best-kept pig always gives the most trouble. - I'll have another one ready in no time. - Here, little mother. Vanilla grass. Stuff it inside your velvet squares. - You read women's thoughts, Outlander. Are you in league with the Devil? - I've had some experience. - But you're a bachelor. (crickets) (knocking) - Good evening, Angélina. We killed a pig. Here's some blood sausage, fresh made. - Keep it, Odilon. You have a lot of mouths to feed, and we have all we need. - It's a gift from the heart. But I could offer you so much more, if you liked. - Don't go getting any ideas, Odilon. - I don't understand why you're so stuck-up with me. Good evening, Mr. Desmarais. - No need to rush off, Odilon. - I just came by to bring you a little something. - Come back anytime. We don't go out much. - You could have invited him in. - He's as stubborn as his father. - He won't wait till doomsday. A Provengal... You could do worse. - You know what he wants. - A liking for land isn't a crime, daughter. I know you don't fancy men, but I won't always be here. There's our line to consider. - Your ducks haunted my dreams, old Didace. - Come on, get a move on. Can't let Provengal catch us! - Bad luck having the gamekeeper for a neighbour. - That's nothing to me! He hasn't seen the light of day, the man who'd rule over Didace Beauchemin... son of Didace. - We could stay under the covers, all toasty and warm. We're all alone. - I bet the bastard can shoot straight. - I'm gonna cook some pancakes. (birds chirping) - Fetch! - That's a handy dog! - He may be just a stray, but he's a born hunter. Are you a hunter, Outlander? - Never hunted before. - You're missing out on one of life's greatest pleasures. All the Beauchemins are hunters, from one generation to the next... Except for Amable. - Did you ever lend him your gun? - Wanna try? Go on, go on! Careful with it. Hey, hey... - Old Didace... ...can you see him? - Yes. He's over there. - That blasted Didace! - Good Lord... He's found our hideaway. - Wait till I catch you! - Is he gonna be trouble? - What could he do to me? Look at him! - You've been dropping by more often since the Outlander showed up. - Seriously, Phonsine! You know I've never been boy-crazy. Besides, think about it. A man like the Outlander would never look at a girl like me. - A good thing too. Amable thinks he must've done something wrong in his hometown to show up out of nowhere like that. The Outlander's a restless man. You'd think he had the Devil in him the minute he's out of bed. He reminds me of an osprey. Easy on the eyes, solid-looking... yet light as a bunch of feathers! (chicken cackling) My very dearly beloved you want to hear me talk of love But your pink and charming lips are better suited to the task (in unison): The sound of that sweet language sets my senses quivering And from my not-so-sensible heart fire could suddenly spring (chuckling) - It's nice to see you smile like that. - It's a beautiful song. - Your turn, Angélina. Let me hear... What did you say? "The music of the words." - "Walk while you have the light... "that darkness doesn't overtake you. "He who walks in darkness doesn't know where he is going. "Believe in the light, that you may become children of light." - Those blasted rats gnawed at my straps! Look at that! - Let me get a look. I can fix it with oxhide. - You think you can fix it? - Sure. - If he says so, don't worry. - Well, it sure would come in handy. - Leave it to me. (bell ring) Over there, Old Didace? - Yeah, put it there. What's wrong with Salvail? - I'll give him a hand. - Amable, you go too. - There's no need. - Amable. - Mr. Beauchemin! You'd never believe hunting season's just opened. Have you been shooting all night? - Nope. Don't forget I'm a crack shot, Beau-Blanc. - Beau-Hana'.! Help me unload my potatoes! - Potatoes? - Yeah. - Good day, Outlander. - Good day. Need a hand? - I won't say no. - You're not gonna lift that all by yourself? (laughing) - Go on. - He could win loading competitions. - Stop gawking, stupid. Come on! - Who's the redhead straining like a bull? He's never been to market before. - The Beauchemins' Outlander. - If he's a Beauchemin so are you, Joinville Provengal! He's no Beauchemin, understood? - Open your ears before you flap your lips, brother! I didn't say "Outlander Beauchemin," I said, "The Beauchemins' Outlander!" - But he's got another name? - No one knows it. He's an Outlander. - Is he one of them fellas that can clot blood? Or maybe he can conjure fish pies, the Devil and his train? (laughing) I used to know a wanderer who said he could help a creature get in the family way. Guess how he did it? Huh? (all laughing) - Big Gerry from Maska, move on right now or I'll pull your hat so far down you'll never see another sunset! - Don't get on your high horse, old man! - The rest of you, don't poke fun at the Outlander. He has his faults, but he's good enough to be a Beauchemin. - Looks like Old man Didace adopted him. - Take a few sacks to the little fort. We'll be done sooner. What do you do with a drunken sailor What do you do with a drunken sailor - That's not yours! What do you do with a drunken sailor Early in the morning Way hay up she rises Way hay up she rises Way hay up she rises Early in the morning Keep him away from the captain's daughter Keep him away from the captain's daughter Keep him away from the captain's daughter Early in the morning Way hay up she rises Way hay up she rises Way hay up she rises Early in the morning Shave his belly with a rusty razor Shave his belly with a rusty razor Shave his belly with a rusty razor Early in the morning - Old Didace! Have a seat! Shave his belly with a rusty razor Shave his belly with a rusty razor (laughing) - What are you doing here? - My sailor friends are telling me news from the world! - I'm taking you back to Monk's Inlet. Hurry up. - I'm not your property, Old Didace. - Maybe not, but you owe me for the potatoes. - Do you want my boots and coat? 'Cause I've nothing left! I don't get any wages, so I never have a dime! - Is he your... your father. - No. - He looks like your father. (laughing) - Mike's gonna stand us a drink! It'll do you good. Do you pay a round, Mike? For my old friend. - That'll be my pleasure. - Have a seat. - I'm buying a round! (cheering) - One drink, then we go home. - Sure, sure. One drink. Mike. Old Didace, Mike. - Old Didace. - Didace. - Old Didace. Pleasure. - Where do you come from, Mike? - Where you from, Mike? - I come from Ireland. Ireland. - Ireland. - Island... - That's right, it is an island. - Island... - You heard of that? The island of Ireland. - Uh... (laughing) - "Now I can hardly meet his eyes "without seeing a spark glowing there... And I think it must mean something." - Did your Outlander say he was coming tonight? - You know he doesn't always tell me. - He doesn't care for propriety, that's for sure. - He does as he pleases. That doesn't make him a bad man. - I know, Angélina. But... a man without a country, without a house... without assets... He's like a feather blowing in the wind. - "I'm sorry I never gave you an answer. "I might be the cause of a few sad thoughts, a few painful doubts..." - I can't really trust Amable with the property. When I'm dead, mark my words, he'll let it go to waste. No more Beauchemins to carry on my line. - What makes you say that? - Phonsine isn't good enough! Not a single baby after three years of marriage! My daughter Marie-Amanda, who lives in lle-de-Gréce, married the same year, and she's expecting her fourth. - Hey... hey... hey... You're not an old man yet! You could raise more little Beauchemins. - I'm no spring chicken, but I'm not that old for my age. - I wasn't going to walk around Sorel with a pig slung across my back! (laughing) - Hey, Acadian! Come here. - What can I do for you, handsome? - I want you to meet Old Didace, from Monk's Inlet. - From the look of you, I'd say you're a farmer. - What makes you say that? I could be a sharecropper. - So what? Same thing! - There's a big difference! A sharecropper owes money on his land while a farmer doesn't owe a cent! - I never read such a thing! - Me neither! But I know it's true all the same. - I bet you could tell a story or two, uh? - I wonder how old she is? - I'd swear she's not a day over 40. Did you see those eyes? As fickle as deep waters... Going from violet to brown, then to black... It takes a while to hit on the right colour, uh? Let's drink to the Acadian! - To the Acadian! - Once his boat is underwater, maybe the bastard'll stop hunting out of season! - Uh... maybe we should sink it further away, Father. - You're right, my son. You're right. - With a pall to bury them... And Chevalier kissed his wife... Everyone soon found their own dearly departed... (coughing) - Come on, Outlander. Go to bed. That big Acadian... (laughing) Come along, my Outlander. (laughing) The Acadian... The Acadian! - The Acadian, whoo! Shh! Amable... - Who? - Amable! Amable is sleeping. - The Acadian is well... rounded. - Nice and plump. - If your mother was still with us, your father wouldn't dare get in such a state. - It's that blasted Outlander's fault. It's like the old man sees a part of himself in him. - It helps him deal with his loss. But a stranger could never replace his own flesh and blood. - Good night, old Didace. - Good night, my boy. Gripes! My boat! My boat's gone! My boat's gone! Just let me catch the bastard who took it. I'll grab him by the throat and choke him on the spot! - Old Didace, who'd steal your boat? It must've drifted away during the night. - Get the rowboat. If it's adrift, we'll find it. Come on! (humming) - The groundhogs are still eating. Winter's far from over. - Do you think we'll be snowed in? - I sure hope not. - Nothing beats a warm house on a bitter day. Don't you agree? - Your mother used to say that. - Are you packing, Outlander? - Could be. Shanties are about to open. - It's no good leaving now. We have to find my boat before the inlet freezes over. - If it means that much to you... - Yeah, Outlander. You care so much it's downright sinful, don't you? - I could make you another one. - Don't waste your breath, Outlander. - I mean it! There's good solid wood around here. - I'd like to see you plane down a board! Where did you learn woodwork? On some back road? (quiet laugh) - I may be ignorant, but I don't talk through my hat. Mind you... I'm gonna need some tools. I can't mold the wood with an axe and a handsaw. - There's a toolbox in the cowshed, but I don't know if it's any good. - Show me. - Amable, take care of the chores. - Looks like he's gonna spend the winter. - Where did I see them? Over here! (laughing) - Where did you get all that, old Didace? - They belonged to one of my ancestors. Couldn't tell you which one though. - This box has everything! Vices, clamps... jack planes, augers... You can name every one of them. - My grandfather had a box like this. - He was a carpenter? - My grandfather? No. He was... He was a sly fox like you. Couldn't remember his ancestor's name either. - It's better than forgetting your own father's name. - My father forgot mine way before that. - Think you have everything you need, Outlander? - I can build you a 15-footer with an 18-inch hold and a tapered back for speed. A real beauty! - I've been thinking... Winter's at the door. You'll need a warm coat, Outlander. There's one in the clothing chest. - You're not serious, Father! It's Ephrem's coat. - He can't use it six feet under. He was about your size. - I won't say no. It's getting cold enough to chase the Devil away. - Won't stop you from staying though. - Here you go, Outlander. - Thank you. - Take anything you need. - I know I shouldn't think of men that way, Mother... Please help me. - Think about it. Wild geese are coming towards us. White as new-blown snow! The flock spans 9 miles altogether. It looks like a big cove in the sky. You can't even begin to picture such a sight, Joinville. - Old Didace would surely lose his mind! (laughing) Mighty nice target practice! - Ah... There's so much to see in the world, Joinville! You get up in the morning, all alone, everything you own on your back... Your heart's so light you could go to the ends of the Earth. - Can a farmer go to sea? - Sure! You just need a cast-iron stomach and a basic knowledge of knots. - Knots? - Nautical knots. Everything's tied up on a boat, and not anyhow. - Can you teach me, Outlander? - Gimme that rope. You can practice all winter. - There's no country like this one, Outlander. - Maybe. You can't know for sure without seeing the others. - I've never been very far, but there's nothing better than crossing your own land. - Our land is everywhere! - Everywhere and nowhere, is exactly the same. Never forget that the old parishes safeguard our nation. ' W0'.! Might be a good idea if you were nice to Odilon tonight. - Don't start, Father. You know what I think. - It's the New Year, girl! - But my heart hasn't changed. - Hey, Didace! Hi! - Hi, David! - W0, we, W0! - So, Didace! Made any New Year's resolutions yet? - Don't get your hopes up, Tubby. You know we're both too old to change. - You could drop the nickname. It's been long enough. - Why? You were plump as a pig when we were young, and you haven't changed a bit! (all laughing) - I've never seen two grown men enjoy goading each other that much! - He started it! - And you keep going. - Will you save me some, my sweet? - Who knows, Outlander? - No favours! You're not starving! Wait your turn. - I just hope there's enough. I have a gargantuan appetite. - A what? - Talk like a man! You're not with your savages here! - Save me a seat. - We'll do that. - Come on, dog. Fetch. Fetch. - Our turn, Outlander. I saved you a seat next to mine. - Thank you. - We don't have to rush right in. There are nicer ways to say thank you. Real easy, too. Just one kiss... You won't regret it. - Outlander! You want all the girls? Isn't the Gimp enough for you? - Don't insult her, Provengal! - Why aren't they back? - Go after them, Joinville. - Are you afraid Bedette will steal your suitors, Angélina? - Quick! They're fighting by the barn. They're bleeding like pigs! ' My God! - It's hard to believe that you're to blame for this. . W0, wo! - Leave them alone. - I'm kind of glad your brother's getting his due. - That's odd coming from you, Beau-Blanc. You've always given in to him. - That's exactly why. - Angelina, stay here. It's between men. - Let me go. - Angélina! Angélina! - Come on! _ Don't give up! - Break his ribs, Odilon! - Vincent, Joinville, let's go. - Fetch Phonsine. We're going home. Better let things cool down a bit. Take it easy, Desmarais. Let's just hitch up the horses. - Oh God... What have you done, Outlander? - Shh! Shh! ' W0'.! - Didace, we need to talk. - Drop the long face, Tubby. We were young once too. How many times did we fight? - No, we've come about my daughter. Your Outlander's buzzing around her. - And he sweet-talked my Bedette! - Yeah, that's likely. Comes a time when the young'uns have to fend for themselves. - We won't let a stranger grab our lands! - Angélina is practically engaged. - First I heard of it. - Don't play dumb, Beauchemin! As if that wasn't bad enough, your two-bit wanderer is corrupting the young'uns! - Even my émile! He keeps harping on about the wide world! - You have to get rid of him before it's too late. - The entire village could come up here. No one tells me what to do. He's staying until my boat is done, and you'd better not get in his way. And Desmarais, I've never heard you refuse his help! - If your Outlander wants to marry in these parts, he'll have to spit his name! - More company, Outlander. - Good morning, Outlander. - Come in, my sweet. - That's nice work. You have a gift, Outlander. - I'm running out of wood, old Didace. Let's finish it off. Then we'll see. - I need more tools for the finish. With 15 bucks, I could go to Montreal and get everything I need. - Fifteen bucks? - You can only find your tools in the big city? Don't fret. He'll think on it. Spring's late coming. Everyone's on edge. - You too? But we're not cut from the same tree. - I don't have a wooden heart, Outlander. - Angélina... - Don't say anything. I'm not asking for anything. - It's the end of March. The ports are finished slumbering. The boats are gonna come for the unloading. It's a good trade. You don't need much training. - Yup... even the inlet's thawing. - Is he going to bed this early? - Here's 15 bucks for the tools... Plus 50 cents for the trip. - I'll leave first thing in the morning. - When will you get back? - In two or three days, no more. - Spring's almost here. Wait till you see it, Outlander. When it's time, the sun, the wind and the rain devour the old snow. When it's done, you can drift on those waters all day long. There's nothing like it. - I brought you some syrup. It's nice and clear this spring. - Thank you, Angélina. - You're using too much flour, Phonsine. - The Outlander really likes my bread. He eats an entire loaf all by himself. Don't bother looking. Maybe he won't come back. - He'll be back, Phonsine. - You were always picky, Angélina. But you made the wrong choice. - Say what you like. He has his faults, but his good points outweigh them. - He's mighty fine-looking, but what can you expect from such a wanderer? - Nothing. I just want to see his walk. I want to hear his laugh. I'm really busy. I'd better go. - Com... Come again. (cow mooing) - Seems like your fine blackbird took wing with our money. - There's a reason why he's not back yet. (cow mooing) - Spit it out, Beau-Hana'.! - I don't want to speak out of turn... - Speak up or shut up. - Since you're twisting my arm... Your Outlander... He's back. - I knew he'd be back. - I... I saw him in Sorel. Guess where? - Aren't you supposed to be tapping syrup with old Desmarais? Stop talking nonsense and get to the sugar shack! - I'm on my way. I bet Angélina'd love to know where her wanderer's been all this time... - if some heartless bastard tells her. - Yeah... - Tell me where you put the tools so we can get them. - I lost them. Didn't buy the wood either. - Cripes, what are you telling me? - I can still finish the boat. I just needed to get away. - You should settle down, Outlander. This wandering's only fit for beggars. - I can't keep breathing the same air, old Didace. - It's never the same! It changes, like the sky above your head. - I'm like a shooting star. A stretch of clear water and a full plate don't matter to me. - Stray dogs die alone on the road. A man needs his fellow creatures more than a mouthful of dust! (laughter inside the hotel) - Wanna see the lovely Acadian, old Didace? - She's a woman of... nice proportions, isn't she? - Why don't we just call them ample? - So what are we waiting for? - Sweet Jesus... It's a disgrace to wallow in drink like that! You should be ashamed of yourself! I'll tell my father-in-law. He's gonna throw you out. Right now, tonight. You can wander around like a dog! That's all you deserve. (Outlander moaning) What about the money and the tools? Where are they? Did you see my father-in-law in Sorel? - He... stayed behind. - What do you mean? Where is he? (coughing) - He's fine where he is. - Poor Outlander... Nobody ever takes care of you. Why are you all alone? - I'm just... I'm just an Outlander... forever on the road. (kissing) - Where do you want to go? - I wanna... I wanna see the sun. It dances... on Easter morn. Uh... Uh... It does dance, huh? On Easter morning. - It's not Easter yet. (crying) - You're right... The sun is dancing. It's dancing... - Phonsine! What's going on? - You're my husband, Amable. (moaning) (rooster crowing) - What a beaut! Sleek as an Indian canoe. - Woo! Watch out, Outlander! We'll be drowned before we get there. - Can't you swim, old Didace? - No. We don't swim around here. But we can sail. - You're like the sailors. "Beauchemin..." It means "nice road." The founder of the line must've liked the road. . You're right. The first members of our line had ants in the pants. They were forever wandering from one end of the country to the other. No one could beat them at it. - So how did they settle in Monk's Inlet? - They'd heard stories about huge trees you could turn into ships' masts and came here late in the fall. They had nothing but an axe and a pack, just like you. - And they never left? - They wanted to leave come spring, but one of them found a woman to his taste. His brother took the road on his own, cursing all the way. I think a man with an aching heart... won't find solace on the road. There's no need to look elsewhere when the land is so generous. - Maybe you're right. - I know I am. - It's almost Easter, Outlander. Today's April 7th. Are you planning any changes? - I don't get it. Do you expect me to go to confession and take communion? - Well, that goes without saying! But I was asking about your work clothes. - Clothes don't matter to me. - Don't say that. They're falling apart. You need new things. Why don't you hunt muskrats for the money? They'll give you 7 to 12 cents for a pelt. And in the meantime... I'll lend it to you. - Listen, my sweet... - Tomorrow. When the market's done. I can go with you... That way the Syrian won't sell you shoddy goods. - Your Outlander's still at the hotel, Angélina. - Are you sure, Father? - I don't get it. Didace only feeds him, but he can pay for drinks. - A man can't be perfect. - A man who likes to drink is bad news, Angélina. - He's a hard worker, he knows the land... he leaves the other women alone... - Be reasonable, Angelina! - And he's never called me a gimp! - Angélina! Where are you going? Angélina! Angélina! (thunder) (laughter inside the hotel) - What are you doing here, Angélina? Are you looking for the King of the road? - Don't go imagining things, Beau-Blanc. I'm not looking for anyone. - Yeah. I believe that. - Paulo, have you got a family? - More than one! I must have two or three kids I'll never meet. - And they'll wait for you all life long. - What? - Forget it. - Angélina? Your gentleman friend stranded you in Sorel? - We haven't seen him in a while. He's probably miles away by now. - Outlander! - Angélina... I didn't expect to see you in town. - Drinking's a dangerous habit, Outlander. - I know, but... It dulls the pain in my heart. - Don't bottle up your troubles. It's bad for you. Are you hiding something from me? - Of course not, my sweet. - When people say mean things, pay them no mind. They're risking their own souls, not yours. - You've had your share of pain, Angélina. But some demon doesn't keep reminding you... that you don't belong. - Don't listen! It could be bad luck. - This is for you. - You didn't find those snails around here! - No. They're sea shells. A sailor brought them back from the West Indies. You look pretty. - Thank you. (birds chirping) Don't you think it smells like honey? I don't know what's happening in the world, but the inlet waters have never been brighter... nor the cottonwood leaves so green. What are you thinking about? - Just that... I've never stayed anywhere this long before. Usually, a month's plenty. - Maybe the inlet tamed your demon? - Maybe. - I've had an idea. I think you'll like it. I want to exchange my harmonium for a piano. - That's not a bad idea. - And I wanted to let you know... that my father is willing to transfer his land titles to me. - What difference does it make? - The man who marries me won't be so unfortunate. - That's true, Angélina. But the land has nothing to do with it. (humming) I feel myself quivering My heart is not wise It barely contains its flame... - Put out your candle. - I have something to tell you. I think that... I'm in the family way, Amable. - You're not serious, Phonsine? - You heard me. - The old man'll have to respect me if I give him an heir. - Let's not tell right away. It'll be our secret until we can't hide it anymore. Imagine their surprise... - From this day on, we have nothing to fear from strangers, my Phonsine. Or from anyone else. (honking) - Stay close, Isidore. - Make room, please. Move over. Excuse me, sir. - What's that? - A mechanical horse. It moves on its own. - Yeah? - I saw machines like that overseas. - Really? ' W0'.! - Excuse me. (explosion) - Isidore! Be careful! Isidore, are you all right? Thank you. Thank you, stranger. - You're welcome. - You saved my rig, Outlander. - That wasn't the point, Big Hat. - Same difference! That's not for choir boys! Take a drink, Joinville. - Thanks. (all laughing) - Drinks all around! (cheering) - To the Outlander! (cheering) - You're one of us, Outlander. The inlet's your home now. - Don't exaggerate. - The next rounds for Mr. Moneybags! - That's right! - Yeah! Let's do that! Oh, I'm...? I'm flat broke! - I thought you made a sale at the little fort, Provengal? - Right... The little fort. The next round's on me! - Coming up, my man! - Good sport, Provengal. - Shame on you! It's his old man's money. - Forget him, Joinville. I'll teach you how to make twice as much. Your chickens can lay in winter if... - Outlander! Don't spill your secrets. Don't forget who's keeping you. (laughing) - Amable, what's freely given is never lost because someone else'll give you something in return. I used to know a Negro sailor who always threw his first hunk of bread overboard, just because a seagull had saved his life after a shipwreck. Cast your bread. You know, "Cast your bread." Cast your bread. - You tell such beautiful stories, Outlander! (laughing) Don't stop. Say it again. I missed some of it. - That's it, Joinville. We're going home. - No! Say it again! The hunk of Negro sailor... I mean, the Negro breed... (cheering) Let's go out to sea, Outlander! We'll take the first boat out! Now I know all the knots. I'm ready. I want to see the world, Outlander. I want to see it too... Outlander. - Well... - See the world... The world! The world... (cheering) - I'm off to the ironworks in Sorel. - Give my regards to the Acadian, old Didace. (laughing) - I'd love to make you give back everything you took from me. - And what's that, Amable? - You took my place in this house! You've been strutting around the inlet and spending our money for months, and now my father... Perhaps we'll never know how much you cost us. - You're the heir, Amable. You don't need anything to gain their respect. - You just have to tell them stories! You have a talent for taking while pretending to give us the world! - I have nothing else to give. You say I've cost you, Amable, but you've never given anything away. - If it hadn't been for us, you'd be eating rat! - Your burden, Amable... is that you don't enjoy living. Nothing will ever please you. Neither the land... nor the woman who loves you... Not even your name... ...despite your pride in it. - We can't all say the same, uh? Some of us deny their names, don't they, Outlander? - Even if I left, you'd have nothing more nor less than you have now. - When will that be? After you've wed Angélina? - My feelings for Angélina are no one's business! - What did you do on board? - Cooking mostly, on ovens laid out in the open. It was a good life. - So why did you leave it? - The barge went up in flames. My husband... God rest his soul... died in the fire. There's nothing left. I threw myself overboard in my burning dress... You're a fine-looking man. - So... Your father's still in Sorel? - He said he'd wait until his seed came in. - He should be back by now. - If you ask me... The Acadian's got her own seeds coming. - Where did she get that name? - Past Quebec... In the gulf, or thereabouts. She was on the barge that burned last summer. - Be careful or she'll fleece you in a heartbeat! She can't be trusted! - Because all strangers are wicked. - Why doesn't she just go back home? - Why did that Acadian ever come here? - Blast those strangers... - Why don't you shoot everyone who's not from the inlet? You don't understand the lure of travel... The taste for new places... In your eyes, the world ends in Sorel. - We've seen everything there is to see! (laughing) The sight of a new bird feeds your conversations for years! But you're not so unfortunate... You'll just die without seeing much of anything. - Talk is talk, Outlander. We're fine the way we are. - Wanderers all die like dogs, unshriven and buried in mud! - Well said, Father. - What about the roads in bloom? And there's no mud on the ocean! - Keep quiet, Joinville. Your father knows best. - Go on, keep up your chatter. But you can't swear you'll die in your beds! None of you! Maybe I'll breathe my last in a ditch somewhere... but I'll see the sky. And I'll be proud to start on my final journey. - You'll choose the right road for once. (laughing) - Never mind. - Outlander! - Angélina. - I was looking for you. You're not the same, Outlander. - What makes you say that? - When you were talking in there, your voice sounded... strange. Something's bothering you. - You know what's wrong, Angélina. You've always known. - Do you need money? I could lend you more. - Angélina, don't... - You really helped us out. We owe you so much more. - There's nothing owing on either side. - I know. I'd give you everything. Everything. - You have such a big heart, my sweet. - If you feel something for me, Outlander... forget the road. (Angélina crying) - Get back inside, sweetheart. You'll take cold. - Listen to your heart, Outlander. Not the demon. - Don't cry, my angel. - If you want to go back to the empty roads, do it now. Break my heart with one blow. Just go. (moaning) - Forgive me, Angélina. Get up, you layabouts! There's work to be done! Giddy up, Outlander! What's he up to? Amable? Who left the door open last night? - Probably the Outlander. He was the last one in. - Why is he still in bed? It's not like him. - I'll get him. He's gone! The Outlander is gone... He's really gone. - It's not true. - His pack is gone. He just left the way he came. - Like a savage! That Outlander is barely human. Worse than a stray dog. I told you so, didn't I? - Ah, never mind! - Maybe it's time to give him our news? - Father? - You let the stove go out, daughter. - I would have been his shadow if he'd only asked. He never asked me for anything. If he had... I wouldn't have said no. Does a flower sin when it looks to the sun? He was so brave... So fine-looking... With his proud head... ...and hair like wildfire. I can still hear his laughter echoing down the road... ...clear as a bell.
