When did you ever have faith in humanity? , like vocation, oh. Jesus Christ. Know, Peter, every time I walk up on a homicide victim, it's always the same thought. What's that? Five minutes alone with that piece of shit. So you'd be willing to risk losing land and the girls for someone like this. Hypothetically speaking, Kelly... I think a life sentence in prison, ought to do the trick, John. Oh, yeah, if you were married with kids, you'd be singing a different tune. Maybe. Look, I don't think any of us can get our wish, so what do we got, Pete? Well, we're dealing with a real fucking monster here. Fractured skull, throat was cut, and she was raped. So we could have DNA. I hope so. How long has she been in here doc? I can't tell ten to 12 hours maybe. You know, this is just starting. John What makes you say that? Take a look at it Kel. He's not gonna get away with this. Yeah, tell that to her mother. Later, Pete. Doesn't get any easier does it doc? No it don't. I can't believe this happened, this is just the beginning. Yeah.

Thanks, Pete. What's up, cap? Mosley, tell me we got something good from Brown. What are you looking at me for? Tell him. Smith, you got something for me on this? Actually I do, captain, but I don't know whether you're really gonna like it. Well, I'm all ears. We have his DNA, we have his license, but we don't have as a match on the prints that were found at the scene. I like you Smith, you're smart. I like you too captain. You know cap, that shit's gonna kill you. Stress. Follow up on the license, find out where this girl went last night, who she went out with and come back to me. You got it. Come on let's go, chap chap. What are you waiting for? Bosley? Yeah, cap. Don't mention my cigar again. You got it. I thought you quit. Are you kidding me? It feels a lot safer than nicotine.

Yeah, I'm gonna have to call you back. Hello, hello, hello? All these cellphones suck. Yeah, hi, who are you? I'm Detective Smith, this is detective Bosley. Do you know Kate Pellegrino? Did you say Kate? Yes. Yeah, I'm her roommate. Yeah, what the hell that girl do now? Actually, you know what? Let me tell you what she did. She left her fucking apartment door unlocked again. You know, I told her 1000 times not leave the fucking door unlocked. Don't understand that girl. Who are you? I'm Donna, Donna Ricci. Hello. Hello. Can't even get a signal in my own fucking apartment building. Can you believe this shit? Can you shut the phone down? I need to ask you about Kate Pallegrino. Is she in trouble or? Like can we speak to her parents? Her parents are both dead and she's an only child. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry to tell you this. Kate was murdered. We're investigating the crime. This is some kind of prank right? This is like a sick twisted joke, isn't it? No, I wish it was. Oh my God, I can't believe this. She was like the only family I had and I was the only family she had. God I know we fight but I loved her and she loved me. This can't be real. Know if she was seeing anybody? Yes, she went on a date last night. Do you think he killed Kate? At this point we're just gathering information. You know the guy's name? Yeah, his name was Brad. Just he introduced me while they were drinking wine last night. She met him on a website. He seemed like an all right guy but I told her all those guys are weirdos. You know this guy Brad's address? Yes, we write down guys names and addresses the first time we go out with them. God forbid something happens, you know? Can you do me a favor, Donna? Can you get us that information? Yeah, it's upstairs. I'll be right back. Sorry. Hey, Kel check the perimeter. Break in? Dude, you're not supposed to in be here, man. I need to ask you some questions. Yeah, what's this about? I'll ask the questions. Look, okay? If this is about the music, the noise complaints, we have a license for live music all right, so fuck off. It's not about the music, Brad. Where were you last night? Last night? What the fuck is this about? Look, I was on a date last night, man. There's no crime in that. Yeah, well your date, Kate. She was murdered last night, Brad. What? I didn't have anything to do with that, man. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, look, you're in the middle of a big shit storm here, okay? And things could go two ways, the easy way or the hard way. The choice is yours. Fuck man. That's Kate. Who do you think did this? Trying to find out Brad. That's why I'm here. We met on a dating app. We met up we, really kind of hit it off, had some drinks at this place, Sidebooze or something, and went back to her place. Had a few glasses of wine. Well, her roommate said you guys went out after the fact and Kate never returned. No, no, man, she's lying, that didn't happen. Why would she do that? She's lying, man okay, we didn't go back out. Look, they found sperm inside of Kate, I'm sure you would mind giving a DNA sample. I don't know, man. I mean, people get framed for shit like this. All the time, maybe I need a lawyer. Have you ever been arrested? No, never. There's a guy I'm looking for. I'll see tomorrow at the precinct. Oh, fuck man, this ain't right! Bright and early. Bright and early, asshole. Real lucky.

I don't know, anything. Anything would really, really help us out. No, I'm sorry nothing sticks out my head. Okay. Well, if you think of anything.. Sure, yeah, definitely. Okay, thank you. All right, thanks. We have a dead end Kel. Yeah, let's keep. What we have is one dead woman. No, no, nobody mentioned a serial killer because the enemy's findings are incomplete, sir. As soon as that's done, you'll be the first one that I call. Yes, sir. Yes, chief, yes. You heard that right. Chief of DS already busting my balls over this one. His exact words 'swift justice'. That's what we need. Forget him. I need results on this thing quick. So, tell me we got a suspect in custody. I don't think he's our guy. Why, may I ask, is that Smith? He gave his DNA up too fast. I wasn't talking to you Bosley. Smith? Well, John's right about that. Also, we went to Sema bar where they had their date, questioned the waitress, nothing. Well, bring me back something. What you sitting around here for, go. Okay. Thanks cap. The science my teaching profession, what I love to do more than anything else is dancing. I love to get out there and let the music move right through me. Take a pill, sweat my ass off, and just dance. That to me is everything. Do you know dance? Can you feel what I'm talking about? Or are you one of those non drug health freaks? No, I'm not a health freak. I take a pill once in a while just for fun and dancing till the sun goes out. Does it sounds like fun Rachel? Yes, yes, yes. But, listen I have to run. My roommate is telling me cable is out again. So I have to call Cablevision for her since she can't do anything. Take it out without me.

I won't tell anyone, please. Please, just let me go. If you want to walk out of here, you have to do exactly as I instruct. You got it? Yes. Okay. Why didn't she help me? I would have helped her if it were the other way around. I know right from wrong, why didn't she? I don't understand. You're a teacher, maybe you could explain it to me. How did you know I'm a teacher? You don't ask the questions, I do! You wet the bed again, Henry? Why must we go through this again, Henry, huh? Please don't hurt me daddy! Why? Tell me Rachel. I'm just trying to understand. When will it end, Rachel, when does it stop, does it stop with you in your lifetime? I mean, it's pretty easy to see what I'm trying to do here. I can't make it any more easy for them can I? Do you agree? Yes I agree, I agree. What do you agree with? Yes, I do. You don't even know what I'm talking about. What do you agree with? You're a teacher, how could you not understand? I'm trying.. You're a teacher! You are a teacher. I agree. What do you agree with, huh? I agree with what you're saying. I'm just trying to understand. What you need to understand And what they need to understand is that, they have to be the patties not not not the sons, the mothers, must sacrifice for the sons, so the sons, so the sons can go on and they must sacrifice everything if that what it takes. Please ask me questions. Ask me. You said you'd ask me questions and then you'd let me go. That's what baffles me, I don't understand it, so black and white. Even if I have to die, for the public to see then so be it. Let me tell the public for you. I will. If you let me go I will tell the sense of what you're doing. You'll tell the public what they need to know? Yes, yes. Yes, I will. It wasn't a fucking question! I hate you, I hate you! I'm gonna kill you! Why don't you love me? I hate you! No, no, stop no. Let's go again. Motherfucker. What the hell is that? Where? Look at that Get some plastic. Motherfucker. What do we got guys? Jesus fucking Christ. This guy's taunting us. Technology, the founder? This guy over here. They live in the same building complex. Oh, really? We should talk to... Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me, guys, I'll take this from here. Thanks. You can keep the pen. Hey what was he saying? So I was telling the officer, so I was jogging by around seven, and I noticed plastic but it didn't like look like a plastic bag so that that's why I stopped to investigate it. Is true you knew the victim? Yeah, she was in my building. She, I didn't even know her name. I knew her roommates name though, Lisa Simone. Okay, so we'll go talk to Lisa and if we need you for anything, we'll contact you. Yeah, everything's on my card, name, information, whatever you need. All right, we'll contact you. Okay. Thanks, just don't go anywhere too far, okay? Okay, thanks. Let's go talk to Lisa. Ring it again. This is a dead end Kel. Maybe she's not home She's not gonna answer Ring it one more time. It's a waste. It's a dead end. All right whatever let's just go. Come on, come on Lisa pick up the phone! Come on I'm right downstairs. Buzz me and I'll pickup, please Lisa. Excuse me, are you looking for Lisa Simone? Yeah, why? I'm detective John Bosley, this is detective Kelly Smith, who are you? I'm Bobby Simone, this is my sister. What's your emergency? We were supposed to get lunch today. I called her office, they said she didn't show up for work. It's not like her. After like four messages but got nothing, I know there's a problem. Why are you here? No, no, no. No, no. Stay here. Lisa Simone, this is the police. Are you here? Lisa? Jesus Christ. I knew there had to be a problem. We just lost my father last year to cancer. I don't know how my mother's gonna handle this. I'm so sorry Bobby. We need to ask you a few questions. I'm so sorry Bosley. Yes, you got it cap. Soon as we're done. Thanks. So sorry for that. Was your sister seeing anyone? Chris Gore, he is a broker who lives in Battery Park City on Rector Street. And how about Rachel? Did you know anything about her dating situation? My sister would tell me. They like to meet people on these websites, maybe my sister's computer has some emails or chatting shit on it. Oh, thank you, Bobby, you've been very helpful. We're just going to take a look around but if you think of anything, please don't hesitate to call. We're just gonna need you to step outside. CSI is on the way and we don't want to contaminate the crime scene. Hey, we can get this fucker, okay? This was a copy of the Backman tape. I agree. What do you agree with huh? I agree with what you're saying. I'm just trying to understand. What you need to understand, and what they need to understand is that they have to be the patsies, not the sons. The mothers must sacrifice for the son so the sons can go on and they must sacrifice everything it takes. Please ask me questions. It's black and white. Please ask me questions. You said you'd ask me questions and then let me go. That's what baffles me I don't understand it. So black and white. Even if I have to die for the public to see so be it. Let me tell the public for you, I will. If you let me go on tell the sons of what you're doing. You'll tell the public what they need to know. Yes, yes, yes I will. That wasn't a question. No no no no. How do you not believe in a death penalty? The report from the Emmys office, according to Brown, Pellegrino, Backman and Simone were all strangled, raped and murdered by the same guy. Wait, wait, wait, it's the same DNA that was on Backman? Yes it was. Bosley, care to share your thoughts with us? Just hear me out for a second. While there's a killer, went around the apartment, went into the window and then expects bone there. Either that or someone's totally naive, answers the door and gets overpowered. Or, maybe she knew him. I mean, there was no sign of forced entry. But what's the connection from Pellegrino to Backman and Simone? Well, we spoke to Bobby, Lisa's brother, and he gave us a ton of information on Vince Minnelli, who was the last guy to see Rachel before her disappearance. And also he mentioned that Minnelli met her on a website. And Brad Keen was clear on the power grid on murder, also mentioned he was on this very same website. So now we just need to verify the information on Minnelli. And Minnelli is a good lead. I mean, we'll definitely question him today. Yeah, Bosley and I also were thinking that we were going to set up a sting operation and maybe a long shot but it's really our only lead. What kind of a sting are you talking about? What I want is I want to put Kelly on that site. Have her go on dates at Cebu, we'll be inside a van, If anything happens, we'll rush in. Nothing will happen. We got to do this. No. I don't know. Listen, captain, I need to do this. I mean, whoa, big strong man running around raping and murdering young women. He's a fucking coward. I mean, I'll be there, White. I mean, all the guys, she'll be good cap. I don't know. Captain, we have to get this fucking guy. Please, let us do this. I got her, she's good. All right, go. Thank you, I won't let you down. Thank you. Vince Minelli? Who wants to know? I'm Detective John Bosley, that's detective Smith. You guys came here with this bullshit now, I'm working, can't you see that? Yeah, well, so are we, and we'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind. Yeah, I do mind. I'm tired of being harassed by you fucking cops. Oh yeah. No. How about this? Let the fuck go, my arm. Arrest for what? How about Kel, I don't know, obstruction? Obstruction. Open the please. Tough guy, take him in there. Please. Fucking guy. Please. Okay wait, you win, give me a minute don't pull out. It's too late Minnelli you had your chance. Please, detective, I can't go back there. Wait, now you want to cooperate, really? Yeah, I'll tell you whatever you want. Do you mind if I smoke? Mind if she smokes, why don't you ever ask me if I mind if you're smoking? Cause an addict is an addict, takes one to know one. What the hell happened back there? I got into trouble last year. It's a long story. I don't want to go down that road again. What do you want? Rachel Backman. Okay, what about her? You were the last one to see her alive Vince. What the hell are you talking about? She's dead, so is Lisa Simone. So you either start talking, or we start driving. I didn't kill anyone. This is crazy. Things aren't looking too good for you now, Vince. You need to tell us exactly what happened the night you went out with Rachel. We went to Cebu for dinner, had a few laughs and went back to her place. Did you have sex with her? We have both kinds of DNA, So think about that long and hard before you lie to us. Long and hard Vince. Yes, we had sex, but she wanted it just as much as I did. I swear, I didn't kill anyone. I'll even take one of those lie tests. You're willing to take a polly? Yeah, I'll take one of those too. But detectives, it wasn't me. All right, tell me something, when you went to Cebu, did you notice anything suspicious? Like what? Like anyone.. Wait, wait, yeah. The waitress she came up to me before we left. Rachel went to the bathroom, and she said someone was staring at us. Did you get a look at them? No, he'd gone by the time we got back. But you should talk to her. She had long black hair, she was really pretty. You're still gonna come down to the precinct and take a polly, you know that right? Yeah, fine. I'm gonna cut you loose. So you're willing to co-operate? Yeah, yeah, I didn't kill anyone. Come on. Lets go see that waitress. All right. Excuse me? What can I get for you? I'm looking for a girl with long brown hair, pretty waitress that works here. Julie? Yeah, she's in the back. You mind get her? Yeah I'll get her for you. Is everything okay? Yeah yeah, I have to ask her a couple questions. Okay. Thanks. Hi. I'm Detective Bosley. What can I help you with? I want to ask you a couple questions. Seen this couple? They were here the other night, and you said somebody was looking at them oddly. Do you remember them? No, not really. They were having dinner, they were just finished when you came up... Hold on, yeah, I do remember this guy. Do you remember the guy that was looking at him? Yeah. I'm gonna need a favor. I'm gonna need you to come down to the precinct meet with the sketch artist. Okay, I get off in about an hour. Awesome. You know where Onetour Precinct it is? Yeah. Okay, you're gonna ask for officer Gomez. Okay. I'll take care of it from there. Gomez, got it. Thank you so much. No problem. Appreciate it. He's been arrested. Those aren't his fingerprints, he's not our guy. Not a cap, he took a polly, got no motive. Yeah, and he has no relation whatsoever to Pellegrino, like no connection. So where does that leave us, no leads? We got Julie the waitress from Cebu. Julie the waitress. Yeah, she caught a glimpse of him. She was supposed to be here three hours ago to talk to the sketch artist, Gomez. Gomez. Yeah, I think it was Gomez. Gomez, is there a sketch I'm supposed to be looking at? Thank you. For something, maybe. Lemme see. Have some copies made and distributed maybe somebody can spot him now. So that leads us back to square one, the website. Why don't you jump to square two and find the son of a bitch? Got it? You got it, cap. Hey, I thought you quit that shit. Stress. What are you doing? Hello. Is this thing on? I can't believe I got three dates in one night. Shit I never had three dates in one week. You know what, bro? That I can believe. So so far, I don't see anyone who resembles the sketch and it looks like my date is late. Hi. You startled me. Oh, my apologies for clearly startling you and for being seven minutes late. Yeah, that's okay. Hi. I'm Jerry. I'm Karen. It's very nice to meet you, Jerry, In the flesh. This is your first time? Internet dating, yes. Is it obvious? No. Wanna have a seat? Yes. She's killing us. It's gonna be a long night bro. Right. Oh, hi, how about a bottle of wine, Karen? Yeah, that sounds nice. Fantastic, we will take a bottle of. One bottle coming right up. Thank you. Karen, is something wrong? What? Wrong, is there something wrong? Oh, no, there's nothing wrong. Well you're looking around the room like you're expecting someone. No, don't be silly. No. Thank you. You're welcome. You're an interesting bird. I get that a lot. Are you kidding me? Show your acting skills. Or lack of. Will you cut her some slack? Right on time, Karen. You must be Sam. That's what they call me, but you can call me anything you want. Very nice to meet you. It's very nice to meet you. So, I probably don't look like the pictures I sent you, but... No. It's all good. You know, I'm sure we're gonna have a good time tonight anyway, right? Why don't we skip all this? Go to the back, see what they got available? No. I'm serious, you know, you look like a really special girl. Kind of girl that likes to get a little wild. Lemme get some wild in here and get you moving. I'm almost speechless, but I can tell you one thing. Honey what's that? Mm-hmm? You wanna do something bad to me? Yes, Sam. As a matter of fact, I do. Not the kind of bad things that you're expecting. I'm down for anything. Whoa, pulling out the toys already, huh? Fuck me. I don't think so. So why don't you pay for my drink, stand up and get out of here before I change my mind. You got it. You got it. Asshole. All right guys, I'm coming. Can you believe that guy? Seen it all, heard it all. You should have light that prick up And blow our cover. Look who's talking. You could have blown your cover. It was a bad move Kel. I gotta agree with Bosley on this one. Okay, I guess I just lost it in there for a second but that's just because it reminds me of a lot of actual dates that I've had. What your dates have been that bad? My personal life suffers. I thought of all people I wouldn't have to explain this to you. No, my wife and kids remind me that all the time, about spending time with them and stuff. I just try to remind them that if I take one bad person off the street, one, just one, it may make a difference in somebody's life. You really believe that? I tickle. Wow. I don't know what else to say. Wow. Can I be you? You're really gonna smoke that now, really? Come on, Kel, wait. I'll make a deal. You quit, and I'll quit. Please. Come on. Deal. I hate to break up this movie, but... Who's next up on the list? His name is Thomas. His profile reads a lot softer than Sam. Oh my God, oh my God, I cannot oh my God. I can't believe I fell for that. Oh, oh my god. Look, we got 15 minutes to get in there. Take a breath and do your thing. I got this. You got this. You got this. I got this There's no fucking way she has this. I know. Hey Mack Hey there, I hope you're Karen. I am. Definitely Karen. This guy, this guy could get laid in a dollhouse. Tell me about yourself, Karen? Yeah. I like singing. Oh my God, Kel. I didn't think it could get worse. I'm originally from Minnesota, I love animals. Minnesota and you love animals. Want to buy me a drink too so we can talk some more? Could you bring me? Can you pay for my drink please, I forgot my money. What do you mean no? Double standards. Double standards? Jeez I'd buy you one but I didn't bring any money. Yeah. Could you bring me one Cabernet, please? She'll take care of it. You know, did you just want to have this one?

What are you gonna do? This has been a long day. Yes, it is. But we did lay a lot of groundwork. What's going on in that mind, Kel? Something's still not right. I can't put my finger on it but something is not right. Can you do me a favor? Can you go home? Get some rest? You look like shit. Thank you. Good work tonight, we'll see you tomorrow. Night White.

How could he have gotten out? My window is open but he never jumped out before he wouldn't do that. I mean something's really really wrong here. Look maybe, maybe he heard a cat and he jumped out the window. No, I'm telling you, he wouldn't do that. That's not his style, come on. Something just isn't right. Is the apartment locked down? It's locked down. But, You want me to come over? No, I don't want you to do anything. I'm just overreacting. There is one time that he got up before I got up, on the fourth of July. I found him like two miles away he's not that bright. No he's not. Look, if you don't find him, I'll come over and help you, find him, okay? Okay. Thank you. Look, I'm really sorry for waking you up. And tell Jane I'm really, really sorry too. Have a good night. Good night and will you get some rest? Max? And the body of a 35 year old woman, that was found two nights ago has been identified by police. Her name is not being released by authorities, because her family has yet to be notified. They are apparently out of the country police say Andre Korzof has confessed to the killing. In his statement he claimed his wife was having an affair and when she told him about it, he completely lost control. We all have our reasons. Korzof claims He should not be held responsible for his actions and he is not a threat to the public. Still no solid suspects in two earlier murders this month. The two murdered and wrapped in plastic shower curtains has the mayor on edge. Good it's working see? It's working. Guys you.. Stop. Stop. Mommy help. Help. Stop being so paranoid Jessica.

Even on Hey Cap, it's Bosley, I'm gonna go pick up Kelly. We'll go by Brolin's cabin. Any word if he came home last night. Okay showtime people. Blue team standby, when I say go, we move. Go, go, go. Turn around you piece of shit. You got any weapons on you? No I do not. Henry Brolin, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights? Yeah, I understand. Harder daddy. Piece of shit out of my face, before I do something I regret? Lets go. You like to play rough? Yeah, I'll play rough, get in the fucking car. Yeah, Bosley, we got this motherfucker. That's great.

Detective White, we got him, you did it. You're my best friend. This is detective Bosley I got a DOA it's an MOS. Please send a with. He won't get away with this. Look, John. We're all at a loss here. Smith was a great person. She was a great detective. But we still have to stay focused on what's at hand here. We can never be replaced ever. John, you can't look at it like that. Yeah, how the fuck do you look at it then? This is what separates us from the civilians. We have a job to do and we do it as cold as that may sound. It's the simple truth. My heart is saying we're fighting a losing battle. We're not fighting a losing battle. Just look at all the last we saved by catching this scumbag. You know it could have been a lot worse. Don't let it be in vain You pick the hell of a time to start making sense. Anderson here. Got it. Captain. No surprise to have conflicting reports from the shrinks. Theirs thinks he's a schizophrenic, our says that he's faking it. So what the fuck does that mean? That means we're in for a long battle. Fucking great, fuck. John, what do you want to do? Because we still have a victim out there that might be alive. Do you want to walk now? Or do you want to finish this the right way? I'll finish it. Brolin is in room three. We're going to have him for about five minutes before his attorney gets here. Detective Bosley, do not lose your head, do not fuck this up. No promises captain. Hey cap. Yeah. He's a smart one. It's really gonna play on the schizo thing. He'll go down. They'll go down White. We got everything on you son of a bitch. Then what are you doing a detective? I ask the questions. I'm in charge here you get it. Not you. Your partner thought the same thing and look what happened to her. Don't do it. That's our cue. Fucking piece of fucking shit. Bosley. You'll blow this whole fucking thing. You don't understand no one will ever stop me, never. What the hell is going on in here? Just a small problem counselor. A small problem. Nobody talks to my client unless I'm in the room. Is that understood captain? Yes ma'am. Won't happen again counselor. Now can I have my client alone please? Sure. Thank you captain. Counselor. Captain. Your client ready to talk counselor? Not quite yet captain. What are we talking about? What, you think we're offering a deal? Bosley. How do you sleep with yourself counselor? You know what your client did to those victims? I don't have to listen to this. Bosley. Thank you. You're not welcome. Can we talk about what's on the table? My client's insane remember? That remains to be seen counselor. And the only thing being taken off the table by the DA is the death penalty and that only comes off, pending the survival of Ann Weis. If you so sure of your client's insanity. Why do you even care about the death penalty? I always cover my ass. But we're pretty confident. The only way he'll reveal the whereabouts of Ann, is if he gets to talk to her son, Adam. What? Are you what are your mind? We both know that this Ann Weis thing can't go unanswered. So I don't think you have a choice. Jesus Christ. Okay counselor. You got a deal. On one condition, he can talk to Adam, but only if Bosley is present. Done. Mr. Weiser your Adam is going to be safe. And we're going to find out where they're holding your wife. Sit here. I swear to God, if you get out of line with this kid once, I'll fucking kill you myself, you hear me? You're scaring the boy detective. That's not my intention. Hi Adam. Hi. I know you may not understand what it is that I'm doing, but someday you will and you'll thank me for it. Can I have my mom back? I remember what it was like to be a boy your age. I remember how my mom treated me. You know what? What? It wasn't good. And I know you may think that she's good because I thought that about my mom too. For a while. But then, I started to understand the truth. Jesus Christ How is he supposed to understand your twisted mind, huh? You twisted fuck. May I continue? Or do you want to just forget about the boy's mom. No don't forget about her. It's all right Adam, I'm gonna get your mom back, I promise. You got the floor, for now. Okay? I know that you think your mom is good, but she has the evil inside her. It may not come out all the time, but it does. Sooner or later when it does, it's usually, it's too late. Like it was for me. That's why I became the teacher. So that's a little boys like you don't ever have to suffer ever again. It's gonna be okay mister. I'm sorry your mommy wasn't a good mommy. Maybe my mum will be good now after this. Can I have her back, please? Please? Come on buddy. Adam, you can have her back. Order in the court. The defendant please rise. Docket number 117 the State of New York versus Henry Brolin.
