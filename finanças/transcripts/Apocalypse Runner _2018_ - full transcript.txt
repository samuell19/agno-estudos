The movie has begun. A dead body. Motionless, speechless, a visual representation of death. A man. Perhaps in his mid-30s. Eyes represent how the character sees the world. His glasses are cracked. It must be to show the way he views the world. His location, the desert. A representation of his state of mind. Each direction lacking distinction, like a maze with no compass. A man seeing a dead body in the desert is him seeing it in himself. It is a reflection of himself. No possibility of change. Alive, but dead. The dead man's ring. It is what separates the two worlds. The ring fits his finger that points to the world beyond the circle. Of course! The man is viewing everything through a hole that does not exist. Just as he is now! Analyzing reality like a... Reality like a... "20XX AD" "A world once filled with lies and illusions has come to an end." "The ruler of Kallipolis, the Philosopher King" "banished every artist and poet," "the culprit of all delusions." "Of them he despised the most" "what was once called film." "Apocalypse Runner" Help! Help! "Notting Hill" Mister! Wake up! Mister! They're going to kill you! A girl. Likely in her teens. A young survivor in a perished world. A cliche not worth analyzing. Hand over the items, little girl. They do not belong in a world like this. I don't know what you're talking about. Perhaps your dead body will know. You'll never find them! I hid them in a place you'd never know. Shoot me, you philosophy slaves! -Fire! -Watch out! This one's not easy. Encircle them! You idiot, you think we'll let you? Mister! Show them what you've got! We're trapped! What's wrong with you? It's better this way. They'll attack one at a time. On my mark. One. You're wrong! What kind of moron takes turns attacking? -Of course they'll come at once! -Two. Please, do something! Three! No. Please. It can't be. It can't be this. Nothing is visible. Nothing can be analyzed. Not a fade-out. Please. It can't be a fade-out! It's you. You're the film critic. The critic stuck between film and reality, DS Park the Swordsman. My name's Eunsoo, Eunsoo Jeong. I've been looking for you all along. You know who I am? Before all of this, your dream was to be the best film critic in the world. But when the Philosopher King came and took away films, you went insane and started analyzing reality. That's when it happened. A sword replaced your pen... ...and thus was born seeking revenge on the Philosopher King, DS Park the Swordsman. Adults always told me this was just a myth, but I always knew. I knew I'd meet you someday. This is a solar-powered camcorder. The lens cap is missing, but everything else is fine. I want to film you with this. Until the moment you defeat the Philosopher king. Maybe... Just maybe... We might be able to create something resembling a film. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't? The man's purpose lies elsewhere. If you didn't pay attention to the desert scene, you may not know by now. The desert scene? He is also aware of his internal flaws and he is trying to overcome them. And the reason we are here conversing around this fire... ...is because this fire represents the intangibility of film. Therefore everything you believe in is pointless and futile. The intentions are too obvious. Did you think you could convince me to analyze reality like a film? Once something passes... ...it never comes back. Mister! Mister! You're a film critic. Not just any critic, DS Park the Swordsman! What happened to being the best critic in the world? What happened to your revenge on the Philosopher King? I don't care about revenge. You don't care? I really believed in you. Even when this camcorder almost killed me! Not my problem. Why are you following me? You want to know? Then tell me! Tell me the meaning behind this scene of me following you! What's the meaning behind this meadow? And these boulders! What's the meaning behind these uneven boulders? What about this tree? What does this cliff mean? That field... The sun! What meaning does the sun hold? Please, tell me! Analyze it all! Shut up! The Guardians of Kallipolis. What should we do? I think you should analyze this. Try all you want, I won't do it. Just stay still and be quiet. Was any of it true? Were you really DS Park, sharp as a sword? He does not exist. He's made-up in your imagination. Take it. I don't need it anymore. The film has begun. What's the meaning? What does this mean? The time is now, DS Park! Analyze! The time has finally come! Analyze it! Come on! Analyze the movie! Villains naturally yearn to expose their evil plans... ...once the main character is in their hands. If he takes advantage of this, the man may be able to get the information he needs. Look, footprints! If we follow them, we could find the information you need. Jesus... This moron knows nothing about framing! I can't let her speak that nonsense. Show her what real analyzing is! Humans instinctively look from left to right. Images moving to the right feel natural, while those moving to the left do not. To show the man following his purpose... ...he must move to the right, not left. He seems faster than you. Can you beat him? Can I beat him? Can I beat him!? Speed is not what determines the winner in a sword fight. Especially in a one-on-one fight, it is not who slays the enemy first. It is whoever puts his sword... ...in its case first! Mister, I think this is the end for me. The weather in a movie scene represents the character's internal emotions. Attaboy! If it is sorrow the man is feeling, it is likely to be represented by rain. Analyze! Analyze! Analyze! I must analyze! Hey! Look at me! Where did you get this ring? Who gave it to you? He needs emergency treatment! No! His last words are more important. Hey, say your last words. Anything! A film character never dies before saying his last words! -You... -Yes! You what? ...an McGregor. You an... what? Ewan McGregor. A Scottish actor who starred in "Trainspotting" as an addict... ...and "Star Wars" as Obi-Wan Kenobi. It is commonly mispronounce as Ee-wan. But the correct pronunciation is You-an. He must be a fan of this actor. So what? What's wrong with you? Stop it. Stop! No! Let go! This man was my last hope. But you and this damn camcorder crushed it all! I detest film now, and I hate analyzing it! Why the hell do you keep filming me? Tell me! Because you're mentally ill! You think reality is a movie to analyze. I already know I'm ill! I can't do anything about it! Keep analyzing! As long as I'm filming you you're sane, because your reality then is a movie! DS Park... Who are you? Two days ago she was captured by the Guardians of Kallipolis. What are you talking about? The owner of that ring. Hey! What else do you know? What happened? Your wife... ...believed you would one day find your way back. But when she heard you were still... ...DS Park the Swordsman analyzing everything like a movie, she gave up hoping you would change. No, those are all lies! I don't care about analyzing! I don't care about film! I see.. you've changed. You're not the same critic... ...who gave me that awful review. You're that director. How could you? How could you? Calm down! I changed my mind about your movie! Lies! After those horrible things you said, you expect me to believe you? That movie was my last hope, but you and that damn review crushed every last bit of it! It's the truth! It is! Then re-analyze it. Re-analyze my movie right here, right now! You don't even remember it, do you? They attacked one at a time! What? No matter how many surrounded the main character, the villains always attacked one at a time. Your movie really showed villains can be gentlemanlike in some ways. When the villains confessed their evil plans... ...once they captured the main character, it showed they might have wanted someone to stop them... ...from going through with it. Even when the main character got stabbed first, the villain had the courtesy to fall before he did. All because his sword was in its case first. And when the main character realized the villains' consideration, it started raining to show how he felt inside. Wait, those weren't her words.. I'm honored. "Your wife" Generally, the vertical axis in a frame... ...shows the escalation of the character's determination. The horizontal axis represents each step of the process. Those are the basics of framing and composition. Every film's meaning begins from there. What you choose to show in that frame is what you truly feel inside. Then I guess that tree is still growing. What's wrong? I felt something. It felt like something just changed. What changed? I don't know, but something did. Stop the nonsense and try to keep up. Mister? What now? Don't you feel some sort of presence? I do. It's you walking behind me. Just be quiet. I said be quiet! It just changed again! And again! Mister, let's go back. Please! I feel like I'm fading away! Eunsoo! Eunsoo! No. Not again. Nothing is visible! Nothing can be analyzed. Not a fade-out. Please not another fade-out! The girl I was with, tell me where she is. She's... ...with you in spirit. You can't kill someone with a toy sword, Mr Park. The once famous critic running around... ...seeking revenge on the Philosopher King, abandoning his pen for a sword. Sadly you have forgotten which is mightier. No matter how strong you are, you can't defeat an enemy that doesn't exist. What are you talking about? Why don't you ask Eunsoo? Those are her words, aren't they? Generally, the vertical axis in a frame... ...shows the escalation of the character's determination. The horizontal axis represents each step of the process. Those are the basics of framing and composition. Every film's meaning begins from there. What you choose to show in that frame is what you truly feel inside. Three years ago, you were so determined to become the best critic. You felt analyzing films wasn't enough, and forced yourself to take everything and analyze it like a movie, even reality. You were successful. It you took less than six months... ...before you started confusing reality and film. It was probably around then your wife bought that camcorder. Was it because she wanted to hold on to you? Or make you see the severity of your illness yourself? We'll never know. Two years ago, the two of you were in an accident. You could have saved your wife with emergency treatment. But instead you said... Keep saying your last words. A character never dies if they don't finish their last words. The camcorder was recording then. But the lens cap was on, so the entire frame was black. No! Not the fade-out! You created a universe in your head where films were banned, and strictly controlled everything... ...so you would never find out the truth. You became the one who hated films the most, the Philosopher King. Now for your final question, who is Eunsoo Jeong? She doesn't exist. She was merely a defense mechanism. Why is that? There are 24 frames in every second of a movie. I didn't want to accept the truth... ...that once a frame passes, it'll never come back. This was found in your wife's belongings. Congratulations, Mr Park, you're free to go. "As long as I'm filming you you're sane," "because your reality then is a movie." This rain represents my sadness. It's you. You're the film critic. The critic stuck between film and reality, DS Park the Swordsman. My name's Eunsoo, Eunsoo Jeong. I've been looking for you all along. I want to film you with this. Until... ...the moment you defeat the Philosopher King. Maybe... Just maybe... We might be able to create something resembling a film. We have finally come to this scene. The audience is most certainly confused... ...if there's even anyone left. There really is no point for a match... ...between DS Park the Swordsman and the Philosopher King. No, you're wrong. Is that so? Yes. If we, the characters, are talking and moving, that means someone is watching. What's left after one frame passes, extends to the next and becomes a movie. Revealing the theme through dialogue. It doesn't get worse. This is why... ...I hate movies. Mister. Mister. Mister, can you hear me? Do you have a pen and paper? No, I don't. Why? I have to write my last words. How can you make jokes right now? You're going to be okay, right? I have something for you, something you lost. Answer my question! You're acting as if you're really going to die. I don't need it. I didn't lose anything. I don’t want to lose anything! Now, the movie will come to an end. Soon it will be the final scene, and then the closing credits. Our names will be in it. Everything will be different, but there's no need to be scared. In the hearts of those watching us, your second movie has begun.
