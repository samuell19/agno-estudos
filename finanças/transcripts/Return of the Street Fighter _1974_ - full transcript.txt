OTOGURO: There's a lot of money in it for you. These two are accountants in our main office. And they've caused us a great deal of trouble. This one, Rico Grandol, embezzled most of the gold that came to us out of Thailand. He's trying to escape to Australia at the moment. But this is the one we're most interested in-- Gentoku Rio. They arrested him and he's being grilled at police headquarters. But who knows how long he can hold out? If he talks, it means the end of my whole project. Surugy we need your help. We've got to shut him up. Do it anyway you like, only get him. He's in room number eight at Tokyo Investigation Division. -Double the money. Double it, Otokuro. Or I won't do it. -All right. You get double. COP: Hold up there, you! Hold up! Stop! -There he is. Get her! -Yes sir. Stop! COP: There he is! Boy-o! -Hold it! -All right, you! Come on out! -I must say, you really handled them. Karate, huh? You must be an expert. -All right. Don't you no choose to speak, [INAUDIBLE] Talk! -Say your prayers! -Got away. Damn! -[INAUDIBLE] -His vocal chords are damaged. He's never going to talk to anyone. -Get a doctor. Get a doctor here right away! Get a doctor! -Hurry. Here's the key to the handcuffs. -This [INAUDIBLE] Saturday. So long, Dad! [GIGGLING] And this one? Rio Grandol. When's he get his? -As soon as I'm able to get around to it. -You're really a killer! Listen, man. You got no time to waste. And don't forget. There's all that bread. [SINGING IN JAPANESE] -I realize you took on this case at the request of the commissioner. And I know how bad this is. But you know we're not at liberty to do what we want. That incident brought this thing to a head. And you take course when you're with the police here. -I know that, sir. It's just that the whole thing was my fault. Give me another chance. He got a witness away from under our nose. I want to ask you. Please, I want to take charge of the case again. -Yamagami! I can't. -Very well, sir. I realize it's selfish. Will you take this, please? My resignation. [PHONE RINGING] -Yes? That's right. What's that? You're on the trail of Rio Grandol? That's good. Go and get him. -Information. Melbourne flight 32B. Will it be leaving today? It'll be leaving in time, huh? Thank you. -Oh, stop! -Here, come on! [SIREN] COP: [INAUDIBLE] -Get out of the way! -[GASP] -There he is! -Let's go! -[INAUDIBLE] [SHOUTING] [SHOUTING] [DISTANT SHOUTING] -You like it, huh? That statue is really a splendid one. -Man, that's like solid gold. I wonder what it will bring on the market. -Don't be stupid. It's a great national treasure. As long as it stays right here, the statue is priceless. And to take that Grandol was taking it with him. It's needed to rip off the idiots who think we're building our center. -But the fuzz is onto you. How the hell did the pigs know? -I bet those two men handled too much of our money and they tried to get away with it. Now we're in trouble. Somebody in Tokyo tipped off the police. I think Masaoka of the Sabu-Kahn school. -Too bad, Dad. -There's a Sergeant called Yamagami. He's a student of Masaoka. -They're like the strongest, huh? The Sabu-Kahn. [SHOUTING] [SHRILL CHANTING] -Am I doing something that's bad? -My child, you must concentrate. Blank your thoughts out. Clear out earthly ideas and think only this. I want to. -Yes, father. -I'll begin again. I must. -Well, tell me. Were you fired? -No. I asked to be put back on the case to atone for my error. I handed in my resignation. They wouldn't agree to that. So I'm on leave of absence. I really think it's their way of saying I can go my way on the case, although unofficially of course. -Well, that's typical. -You know, Otaguro eliminated those two men. They knew too much about his business, which means Otaguro's plan is a lot more sinister than we thought. And the thing is, we should act quickly. He has a cute little setup that he calls the Asian Martial-Arts Center. And he's raised over 16 billion yen which he raised in Asian countries. So you know it can't be legitimate. -Well, that's more than I thought. -Yes. And there's more to it. I think Otaguro is working with another organization. -What do you mean? -The mafia has an inside track on this whole thing, I think. Our own police have been checking things out with the United States authorities. Though at the moment, there's nothing to go on. -Your news is awful for Japan. You and I must certainly bring this to an end. Coro! Coro! -Yes? -You get in touch with all the Asian countries where our school has chapters. I want to find out how Otaguro and his organization are raising all that money. And check that Otaguro isn't using my name. Anything shady there, they must send reliable witnesses to Tokyo. Start calling them up. -Yes. -There's another thing. I'd like to know more concerning Surugy. -Terry Surugy? Does he come into this business? -Yes. He's no ordinary men, considering what he did to those two witnesses of ours. All he could use was his two fingers. And he ruined those vocal cords. His two hands were tied. And even that didn't stop Surugy. It had to be Tsurugi. And you know it, don't you? -I must say I do, yes. [INAUDIBLE] is your enemy. Yamagami, I'd advise you to be careful. He's a genius ata Karate. We both tested our skills here once. -[SHRILL BREATHING] [CHOKING] -Long ago in China, I met his father. He was a great Karate artist. And his son is the same. -Mr. Yamagami. Can you give me a lesson? -Ah, Kazuko. You must be making progress. You're at least an inch taller. All right, I'll work out with you if you like. That's fine. You're OK. -It's our turn! -Oh, you're getting good, I must say. -Mr. Otaguro, I want to explain to you the reason why I came. I'm here because I heard you're exploiting Karate and it's spirit. And I urge you to reconsider. -I don't care about the others. But when you repeat such gossip to me, then I shall stop it. I believe in Bushido and Karate and you know that. How can you say that I exploit our mutual trust? -I hope you haven't, believe me. And yet, the police investigation has start-- -Police know nothing. Take a look at this. Money has been donate with enthusiasm. It's for this martial arts center. Better not listen to gossip. I'm as honest as you, Masaoka. And in time, you'll be seeing our institute going up. That's when you'll be convinced. -I warn you that there is contrary evidence. And I can't allow you to continue your scheme. -Evidence? -I'm not telling you about all the things I suspect. Just return the money. That's your only hope. -Welcome to Tokyo. There's a very good reason that in his country, he's the top. Thank you. These are the blueprints. -What I'd like you to tell me is the date you intend to begin construction on this. -Well, actually you see, I, uh-- I, uh-- I cannot give you exact dates as yet. -All right, then. You can tell me the cost, can't you? -Well, you don't have the authority to ask me that. Anything on paper with you? Bring a warrant or forget about it! All right. The gentleman's leaving. Stop it! Do you hear! -[INAUDIBLE] -Please stop! Please stop! [COWERING] No, no, no, that's me! I didn't do anything! Please! In -I think I know where you fit in. And what happens now? -[GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [MUSIC FROM RADIO] -Hey, I don't need music for this. -[INAUDIBLE] Jack. I first started a new orphan's home. I used to sneak out at night, dance with the GIs and talk with them. Oh, I love American. They taught me to groove. They'd come here on furlough out of Korea. I dug it! It was fun! It was all laughs! -Stop talking like that or I'll beat your ass. Just forget about it. -So sorry! You're right, Jackson. I should thank you for all you did for me. When you picked me up on the street, I was starving because how would I have ended up. Thanks a lot, pop! Oh! RADIO: Terry Surugy, Heiwajima subway station, south entrance. Go immediately. Terry Surugy, Heiwajima subway station, south entrance. Go immediately. Message over. -Come to Heiwajima station. You better move it. -Who gave it to you? Well, how did you know it was me, then? What did he look like? What else did he say? Kendo Masaoka. -Take the money! -Afraid to carry out our order to kill Masaoka? -You think you can buy anything. I just can't do it. I can't. -Your mission is to do it. -Stick it right in your ass. You can't order me around even if you have money. -I think you'd better think this over. Because you know what can happen. -Don't threaten me. Because I know just what can happen to you. -No! -But what do we do? -Arrange to get rid of him. He knows too much. So kill him. OTAGURO (VOICEOVER): Arrange to get rid of him. He knows too much. So kill him. -Hey, Terry! You're losing your marbles! Why did you tell him no? -Because I had to. Why should I kill him? Masaoka is the only one I can trust. -You'll be murdered! And then what are you going to do? No dude is worth it. And there's all that money waiting. Don't throw it away, Terry. That green is clean! This cold is terrible. Why did you pick such a cold place? Hey, why don't you think it over? Terry, let's go back to Tokyo. [SCREAMING] [CHOKING] -You alright, palsy? You hurt? Oh yes. Come back! Come back! -That's a pretty good physique. You don't get that sitting around. Sports, that's what you're into, right? I'd say ping-pong or badminton, right? Huh? -[GRUNT] -[GRUNT] I know how it is. Karate is my thing. I'm good. I reached the 4th Dan! And it wasn't easy. [LAUGHS] Oh, when you get to that point, you're untouchable. It's a combination of oriental mysticism and brute strength. You learn that the best offense is always your own defense pattern, huh? And once you know that, there's nothing to fear. Nothing to worry about except for putting on too much weight. You've got to be careful because it can slow you down. But I watch it. And I've developed a chop that can paralyze the heart. Once I do that chop, an opponent can't stand up to me. I know I've got him. Hey, look at this. It's one of my best. Watch, you'll learn something! Not many can do this. It's my best trick. [WHEEZING] [COUGHING] Oh, my throat's a little dry. It's the heat in here. Now I've going to split a rock with my bare hands. It took me a year to learn this. Ah! Oh! Oh, it's hot. [BREATHING] Oh. Oh, that' was pretty embarrassing. But you learn from everything. Like, never pick up a hot rock, eh? Remember that. In Karate talk, we call a thing like this a burn. Injuries are never going to put a stop to a fourth Dan, though. Makes them sharper. That's where the Oriental mysticism comes in. As Confucius say, once bitten, twice shy, and watch out for hot rocks, eh? Oh. Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Let me get him! How can you treat a fourth Dan like this? -[MOANING] -[GROAN] [CHOKING] -[GROANING] -This is a photograph of the head of our Rangoon chapter. He disappeared. And then a week later, his body turned up mutilated on the shore. And the police haven't solved it yet. -A good man. I know he worked very hard. -I think it almost certain my friend was killed on orders from the mafia. In his desk, we found this letter. It contains a demand for a donation of $100,000. The letter was sent by Otaguro. But inside, it was signed by you. -I thought so. He forged my name. -In New Delhi last month, three of our men were forced to make contributions. One didn't have any cash. His diamond was accepted. -What an evil man. Now I think we can really get him. -Hey! Wait a minute! Wait for me! Oh. -[SCREAM] [SCREAM] -I can see the mafia works through you. You and I could have had a nice evening, huh? -Ah! No! No! No! Please. No! No! Ah! No! No! Please. No! No! [CRACK] -So the mafia works through you too, hm? -[SCREAM] -No, Terry, please! You mustn't! You mustn't run. Listen to me! Please stop. You mustn't! It's dangerous! It's too dangerous-- -[INAUDIBLE] You're back. -That's right. I'm back and not a corpse. -[SCREAMING] [SCREAM] [CHOKING] -You're going to be a corpse again. -Surugy, I'll remain on earth until I complete my mission which is to kill you. This is an age of wonders in which even a heart can be transplanted by skilled doctors. If you have enough money and the will to live, they can supply you with artificial vocal chords like mine. And so I return. The mafia's ordered me to kill you. And I'm going to do just as they say. And if they hadn't, I'd kill you now gladly because I want to. [INAUDIBLE] the only reason I went through the operation is to you and survive. Surugy, let's go somewhere alone and conclude what you started long ago. -No! You mustn't! Don't go. Please! [THUNDER CLAP] -[SCREAM] -Terry, come on! You can't be dead! -There is a-- a plot to throw discredit on me and my entire organization. You're trying to ruin me and you ask me to do nothing? Good day! -Sit! I can tell you that the game is up. We have proof. Coro! -Yes. -The master of our chapter in Rangoon, Ten Mao. From the New Delhi, India, chapter of the World Karate Union, Mr. Gorosing. You demanded money and donations, saying that I supported you, saying that there was a center we'd put up and calling this organization the Asian Martial Arts Center. You threatened the lives of rich and poor alike, forcing them to give you money. And from those who couldn't, you stole statues and jewels. Anything to turn into cash. You used my name to lie and cheat. And those poor souls who cannot pay because they are honest are threatened with murderer by your assassins. Sealing your doom, I'm in possession of these letters to which you forged my name to raise funds for a building I never approved or consent to. And these witnesses have come here to swear to it in court. Is that enough? -All those plans you had were just dummies to help you exploit others! And the money you so diligently raised. The mafia's got it now! You sent it America and you know it! -That's not true! I wouldn't do a thing like that. -And you're a murder too. Otaguro, your school's a front used for gangster. But the game, I think, is up. You can tell them. -You extorted as much as you could for the mafia from Asian countries and sent it to do them. But now I guess the mafia will just have to do without what you send. More than that, Otaguro, you're going to prison. -You'd better think it over. You know I have to call the police. But then, there's still a chance that you can make amends as a man of honor and a Karate man. You'd better think of something. -I found out we're in difficulty. -I know that, Otaguro. I know that. The mafia won't like it. I must say, it's a pity. You're useless. You're just another slant-eyed, inefficient Jap. So now what, Otaguro? Instead of you, I'll take charge and manage things. You're useless to us now! -[GROAN] MOBSTER: Get away from the yellow-skinned dog! -[GROAN] [GROAN] -Imura. IMURA: Right. -This is the best restaurant in Tokyo. I come here often. Very happy you get a chance to eat here. -Thank yo. -Now come, toast. -Yes. Good luck. Here's to success. -Help yourself. -Thank you. Look out! -[SCREAM] [GROAN] -No! No! -Yamagami! Oh no. -Terry, it's me! You're all right! Come on, now. Come on. Come on. You've got to go with him. You're coming to. Come on! You're not dead. You'll be all right. You came back, Terry. -Dada! -Get away. -Dada! -Get away form here. -Please. Please listen! -Beat it. -You think father's a spy. He's not! So do not hurt him! -Oh no. You've got to let him go. -You'd better shut up. Your father's a traitor and your mother's a whore. You're no Japanese. You're half-breed. You're scum! -Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! FATHER (VOICEOVER): Listen, my son. Trust no one! You can count on no one but yourself! Improve your skills, son. Harden your body. Become a number one man! Do not ever let anyone beat you. -It's me, Terry! It's Katie! Don't you know me? [INAUDIBLE] you've been unconscious so long. Eat something. -And you stayed with me? -As long as you're all right. And now, you're going to have to get out of town. -What about you? -I'll do all right. You mustn't-- you mustn't worry about me. -[CHUCKLES] The mafia here. They're sure to murder anyone who betrays them. -You knew. You knew all along. -All that jiving of yours. Nobody can trust a girl who jives like that. -[WEEPING] I'm sorry. I've been tailing you for the mafia. All that about my life as a kid. That's all true! I was an orphan. I had nobody. All that part I was honest about. All of it! I didn't know, after I got to dig you, how I'd feel. Now I'll do whatever it is you want. -What I'd like to do is kill Otaguro. But I must make sure Masaoka's all right. -Otaguro's been killed. And they injured Masaoka. Yamagami's murdered. -Is that true? -Nobody's going to stop them. They're all criminals. Masaoka will be murdered. I heard the mafia say so. -You sure of that? -That's pretty good, Surugy. Come! Go! -Somebody's got to stop these murders. see -Terry, be careful! -[BREATHING HARSHLY] -No! No! Leave me alone! Someone help me! Oh! Oh! Leave me alone! Let me go! No! [SCREAM] [SCREAM] -What did they do to you? What did they do? -Oh, Terry. It's you. Quickly. Run! Run! Run away! -Where are they? Where are they? -Well. Surugy. I was positive that you'd come. You can't save that blind, yellow bitch. She told us you're not dead. She wouldn't talk too easily. And so we used a little persuasion. -So you're the mafia boss in the area. -I wouldn't say boss. I'm in charge, though, as long as I aim at your head. And I've got a job to do. Don Costello is the name. -So you're Costello. -The girl betrayed us, nursing her when she was hired to set you up. Unwise to do that. It's clear she'll be sorry. I'm sure you know how the mafia works. They had a very good idea to take over the whole lousy yellow hemisphere and get rid of them. But then, Masaoka and you got into it and spoiled our game. We don't tolerate anybody like that. See what I mean? Now it's your turn! -Costello, listen. I'll do it. Let me. Surugy and I have a date with destiny. I was set long ago. -OK. -Surugy. Are you ready to die? -You'll see. -Surugy, let's go. -Kill him! Get him! -Get him now! -[PANTING] Please! Give me a chance! Please! Give me a chance! Leave me alone! I [INAUDIBLE] Ah! Ah! Please!
