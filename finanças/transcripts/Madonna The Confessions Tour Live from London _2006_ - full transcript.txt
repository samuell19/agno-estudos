I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air, trying to release my father?s hands from my throat. I looked into his eyes and wondered if my feet would ever touch the floor again. Have you ever been hit so hard that it sends your body flying across the room? We all fall to the floor at some point. It?s how you pick yourself up, that?s the real challenge. Isn?t it? I?ve always lived in my own world. And i dance to escape my troubles. I?ve learned that there?s light even in the darkest places. I can?t blame my father for anything. You can?t rely on other people to make you happy. But i know deep down inside, he loved me. There was a time i suffered so much i wanted to get it out of me. I would cut my arms, not to kill myself. I don?t want to die. I know i am lucky to be on this earth. I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain that was eating me inside. Nothing was erased. I leave with my past tucked away deep inside of me. It comes out as an explosion and it invades me. I believe we are messengers on Earth. I believe in angels. I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much to become who i am today. Now,you have to realize, not only do i have a family, but now i have a whole hood, and that?s power. But i ain?t no grimey-ass nigga. I was never out to kill anybody. Especially when i made that decision to gang-bang. I just wanted to fit in. But one day,i was forced to do something that made me open my eyes. And i realized that this shit ain?t no game. One of the homies got popped and i was pressured into doing my first drive-by. It was kinda fucked up, the way they tried to set me up. Me and my bro,we was headed back to the eight block. Some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere. We pulled up to the corner then he placed a chunky-ass gun in my ride. He said, You know what to do with it. It?s time to get poppin? for the hood. But i wasn?t out to kill anybody. * Live to Tell I have a tale to tell Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well I was not ready for the fall Too blind to see the writing on the wall A man can tell a thousand lies I?ve learned my lesson well Hope I live to tell The secret I have learned, ?till then It will burn inside of me I know where beauty lives I?ve seen it once, I know the warm she gives The light that you could never see It shines inside, you can?t take that from me A man can tell a thousand lies I?ve learned my lesson well Hope I live to tell The secret I have learned, ?till then It will burn inside of me The truth is never far behind You kept it hidden well If I live to tell The secret I knew then Will I ever have the chance again In Africa 12.000.000 children are orphaned by AIDS If I ran away, I?d never have the strength To go very far How would they hear the beating of my heart Will it grow cold The secret that I hide, will I grow old How will they hear When will they learn How will they know For Iwas hungry and you gave me food I was naked and you gave me clothing I was sick and you took care for me And God replied, 'Whatever you did for one of the least of my brothers... ...you did it to me' Matthew 25:35 * Forbidden Love Just one kiss on my lips Was all it took to seal the future Just one look from your eyes Was like a certain kind of torture Once upon a time There was a boy and there was a girl Just one touch from your hands Was all it took to make me falter Forbidden love Are we supposed to be together Forbidden love, forbidden love We sealed our destiny forever Forbidden love, forbidden love Just one smile on your face Was all it took to change my fortune Just one word from your mouth Was all I needed to be certain Once upon a time There was a boy and there was a girl Hearts that intertwine They lived in a different kind of world Forbidden love Are we supposed to be together Forbidden love, forbidden love Forbidden love We sealed our destiny forever Forbidden love, forbidden love Just one kiss Just one touch Just one look Forbidden love Are we supposed to be together Forbidden love, forbidden love Forbidden love We sealed our destiny forever Forbidden love, forbidden love Just one kiss, Just one touch, Just one look * Isaac Im nin'alu Dal thae na di vim Dal thae na di vim Dal thae ma rom Im nin'alu Im nin'aaalu Staring up into the heavens In this hell that binds your hands Will you sacrifice your comfort?
