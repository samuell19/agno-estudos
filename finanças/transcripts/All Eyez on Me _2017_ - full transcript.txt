I came to give you an address from the political prisoners held captive in the dungeons of the United States. They do not want me to give you this address here in the United States. African-American people and their movements for liberation have been criminalized. Our finest and freedom fighters have been slain in the streets. Our people who stand up for our freedom, have been railroaded to prison by the same legal system that tries to protect you today and yet tried to kill you yesterday. There are black political prisoners here in the United States! And on behalf of the white American political prisoners, I say to you, brother, we love you and we will not give up the fight! We will not give up the fight! We will not give up the fight! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Subtitle Sync by: Aren Zo Instagram: @aren.zo I shall not fear no man but God. Though I walk through the valley of death. I shed so many tears If I should die before I wake. Please, God, walk with me. Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven. Forgive me for my sins, let me into Heaven. Back in elementary, I thrived on misery. Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed. Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest. Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest. Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past. You wanna last? Be the first to blast. Remember Kato. No longer with us he's deceased. Call on the sirens. Seen him murdered in the streets. Now rest in peace ls there heaven for a G? Remember me. So many homies in the cemetery Shed so many tears. I! I suffered through the years. And shed so many tears. How's it goin'? Every brother ain't a brother? - Good time for this? - Yes. The first time we talked on the phone and you agreed to these interviews, you said, and I quote, "lf they kill me, I want the people to have every drop. I want them to know the real story." All I'm tryin' to do is tell your real story. REPORTER". After eight months, the longest trial in New York State history has reached its conclusion. The Panther 21, accused of conspiring to murder police officers and blow up government buildings, have been acquitted on all counts. Yes. Miss Shakur! Miss Shakur, how does it feel to be free? "Free"? You were incarcerated for months. You fought your own case without representation and won. Now that you're out, isn't there something you'd like to say? Yes, I am a black woman. A black woman who just defended herself against a racist, fascist, imperialist system and won! But we must never forget all the brothers and sisters wrongfully accused, who may never see justice. We must speak for them, because everybody knows that all people don't have freedom. And all people don't have power. Yes! We are in a revolution! Freedom ain't free. And though I walk through these doors right now, I am yet to earn true freedom, for my people. And for the unborn child growing in my womb. Power to the people! Power to the people! Billy Garland was your biological father. But she ended up with Mutulu. Right. Brothers and sisters, Mutulu Shakur. - Black is beautiful. - Black is beautiful! I don't think y'all heard me. I said, "Black is beautiful." Black is beautiful! They try to tell me to watch my mouth. Like I always do. [All laugh 1. I said, "You need to listen to what comes out of my mouth." You must stand for something. You must live for something! And you must be willing to die for something! I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees. I am a revolutionary! Did you read that article in The New York Times? - Yes, ma'am. - And? Nelson Mandela just got transferred from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. And what did you think about what the journalist said about the escalated violence in the towns? Motherfucka. You watch your sister. Hey! I saw you last week at the grocery store. Then I saw you while we were feeding the homeless. That was sweet. You and all your other FBI pigs need to stay the hell away from my family! Well, that's not gonna happen. Not until I have that son of a bitch. Well, good, motherfuckin' luck! Motherfucka! Take care of those kids. Come on! Merry Christmas, young man. Thank you, Mama. I love it, Mama. - Thank you, Daddy. - You're welcome, baby. That'll get you a lot further than a basketball. Hey. Thanks, Mama. What's up, beautiful? I'm sorry I didn't get you a gift. You are my gift. Hey. You know I'm gonna be gone for a while. They gonna be lookin' for me. I love you. FBI! Get down! Get down! On the floor! Get away from my kids! Get your pig hands off my fuckin' kids! - Get her down! - On the fucking ground! Stay down. I demand to see a warrant! The Fourth Amendment provides that the people be secure in their houses against an unreasonable search! Where's your boy, Afeni? You don't know? Let me remind you. The bank robbing motherfucker? You like seeing them like that? - Fuck you! - Not tonight, sweetheart. It's Christmas. Get off! Keep her the fuck down. Fucking bitch! Will those men come get us in Baltimore? Not if I can help it. I'm cold. Come here. He really a bank robber? You know, I don't know. And it doesn't matter, they're just tryin' to neutralize him. How come? Because he is a threat to the structure of the society. Your stepdaddy is a revolutionary. I'm gonna be a revolutionary. I got a letter from the government the other day I opened and read it It said they were suckers. They wanted me for their army or whatever. Picture me givin' a damn, I said never. I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute. It occurred to me the suckers had authority. Keep fuckin' walkin', boy! Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune... Or to take arms against a sea of troubles... And by opposing end them? To die, to sleep, No more. Meet the lead in your production of Hamlet. Congratulations. Who's my next victim? Fakespeare. De Niro, baby. Stop before your big ol' ass head gets even bigger. Can't get no bigger than yours. Look who's talkin'. - You a scrub. - You a scrub! You got jokes. And that's where you met Jada Pinkett? She was somebody that I connected with on a deeper level than, you know, just some romance type of thing. She was really my true best friend. What up, Setch? You got something. Thank God. I was hungry. 'Course I got you some food. Where's Mom? In the back. Ma! You been asleep all day? Still no men in your life? No. Mutulu was locked up. What about your biological father? I've only had contact with him three, four times in my life. What about Legs? 'Sup, Pac? - Whassup, man? - Hey, man. Got y'all some groceries. Appreciate it, man. Your momma said y'all needed a few things around here. You know how I do it. - Legs! - Hey, little baby girl. Over there learning your school work? Yes. All right. I can't read or I would help you. What's up, man? How you doin'? Maintaining. Where your mom at? I told her I was coming over here. She in that room. Come outside, let me talk to you right quick.? There you go. Don't nothin' compete with that paper, you know what I'm sayin'? Nothin'. Don't tell your mama I gave it to you, neither. You know she gonna make you buy, like, an encyclopedia or some shit like that. She a smart woman. She told me y'all been going through some things, too. Look. She's still your mama, you understand me? No matter what. Sometimes people need to step outside of who they are to realize what they can really be. You feel me? I feel you. You need anything, you ask me about it. I got you. I appreciate it, man. - This nigga. - Hey, man. You take a vacation on my block? You ain't got my goddamn money, though, do you? Is that what you want, homeboy? That what you want, nigga? I let you slide, I got to let everybody slide! Come on, Legs! I've done nothin'! What was going through your head when your mom says. "You, your sister, everybody pack up." We moving again? No, just us. Mama's sending us away. I'm not sending you away. You're going to stay with a friend of mine from the movement. I cannot leave! All right? Things are finally going good for me here! You're goin'. I need to... figure some stuff out here. Listen. I need you... Come on, baby boy. I need you to be the man of the house. I've been the man in the house. You think I don't know what's going on? What the hell that supposed to mean? You know what it means. You got something to say? Okay. Go on, go on. Say it. Speak! I didn't raise you to be silent! I'm out. Man, what's wrong? What's going on? I gotta fuckin' move to California. Are you serious right now? Are you playing with me? Every time shit start goin' good, somethin' bad happen. We're gonna be friends forever. You and me. It's all good. I wrote something for you. "You are the omega of my heart. The foundation for my conception of love. When I think of What a black woman should be. It's you that I first think of. You will never fully understand. How deeply my heart feels for you. I worry that we'll grow apart And I'll end up losing you. You bring me to climax without sex. And you do it all with regal grace. You are my heart in human form. A friend I could never replace... That was a'ight. You ain't even moved to California yet and you're already going soft on me. - I'm goin' soft? - So soft. You got the tears in your eyes. The tears flow, and I'm bein' soft. I am gonna miss you. City of Dope, I call it Oak. Can't be broke selling coke. Fat ropes, shattered hopes. Fresh cars and all that dope I was exposed to a lot of shit when I got to California, that I didn't see when I was in Baltimore. What's up, y'all? - I'm tired of this! - C'mon, put the knife down. - I'm tired of this! - Please! Put the knife down! I've seen people get killed in front of me the first day I got out there. [ Baby crying 1 I'm just trying to understand your mindset, because it must have been so difficult. You got uprooted from New York to Baltimore. Now you're in California, and you quit school. I knew I had to make some money. So that's when I really started rappin'. I met Leila Steinberg, through this poetry and hip-hop workshop that she was having at her house. Let's welcome MC New York. [ Rapping 1 I'm the son of a Panther, spirit of a rebel. She'd linked me up with this guy named Atron who was managing Digital Underground at the time. But I'm only 18... I got you an audition. Get the fuck outta here. Are you fucking kiddin' me right now? Shit! Tupac. Leila can't stop raving about you. I hope she's right. Follow me. - So you got rhymes? - Hell, And so, they set up a meeting... - That's him. - All right. And I got to rap for Shock G. - What's up, man? - What's up with you, man? Shock G. And of course, you know Money B. What's up with y'all, man? Tupac Shakur. So let's hear your flow. Make some room 'cause I 'm kinda wild. That's just my style Livin' life as a ghetto child. No backin' down Still smile through the pain. They was feelin' my flow. And I got signed. Welcome to the Underground. And the next thing I know, I was on tour. Chicago! Are y'all ready? The Underground is in the house. Stop whatcha doin' 'Cause I'm about to ruin. The image and the style that ya used to I look funny, but, yo, I'm makin' money, see? So, yo, world, I hope you're ready for me. So gather round, I'm the new fool in town. And my sound's laid down By the Underground I drink up all the Hennessy Ya got on ya shelf. Just let me introduce myself. My name is Humpty Pronounced with a "umpty". Yo ladies, how I like to funk thee. And all the rappers in the top 10. Please allow me to bump thee I'm standin' tall, y'all And just like Humpty Dumpty. You're gonna fall When the stereos pump me I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack. And sometimes I get ridiculous I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice. Hey, yo, fat girl, come here Are ya ticklish? I called ya fat Look at me, I'm skinny. But that ain't stopped me from gettin' busy I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom I'm crazy Allow me to amaze thee. They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants. And I even got my own dance. The Humpty Dance is your chance. To do the hump. Do me baby, do the Humpty Hump. Do the Humpty Hump. Do the Humpty Hump. Watch you do the Humpty Hump. Yo, Chicago, we love y'all. Digital Underground is in the house! Thank you! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! So where was your mother at this time? She had joined us in California. All right. - How was that? - It was what it was, man. - Care to elaborate? - Not really. What's up, man? Hey. What up, man? - My God! You're back! - Did you miss me? - No. - You did? No. So, how was the tour? It was crazy. It was good, but it was crazy. This is how good it was. There you go. I see. - What? - Nothin'. Shit, you need more than that? Pac! Don't do anything stupid! I only do this shit 'cause you're my girl, Afeni. I don't do this shit for everybody. What the fuck? - Hey! - Hey! "Yo! " Yo! - The lady's my mama! - Pac, no! This my mom! - What you doin', boy? - Lt's my mama, man! - What you think you doin'? - What are you doin'? Fuck this nigga, man! What am I doin'? What are you doin'? You on this shit? The fuck is the shit, man? - Are you on this shit? - Baby“. - Baby what? - I got it under control. You don't have shit under control! You are being weak, all right? You are better than that. Stop being weak! All right? This shit is killin' our people. Listen, I said I got it under control, baby. It's okay. You don't have shit under control! Who you think you talking to? Tupac Amaru Shakur, don't you walk away from me! I am still your mother! - Hey, Money! Where Shock at? - You know where he at. It's just the same old song. It's just a freestyle. Meanwhile, we keep the beat kicking. Sweat drippin '. .. Yo, Shock. We gotta talk. I'm working, man. I need five minutes. What the fuck is you doing, man? Shit gotta change. What shit? This "stay on the sidelines, pay your dues" shit. I can't fuckin' do it no more. Either I do my own thing, or I'm out. Well, then bounce, nigga! And one more thing... I'm just fuckin' with you, dog. C'mon, man. Don't be fuckin' with me like that, man! - Goddamn! - I got you, man. You about to have me ousted, bro. I'm about to be hot! You over here fuckin' turnin' shit off. I got a little somethin' here for you, man. All around the world same song. All, all around the world same song. SHOCK G". Tupac, go ahead and rock this. [ Rapping 1 Now I clown around. When I hang around with the Underground. Girls used to frown, say I'm down. When I come around. Gas me and when they pass me They used to diss me. Harass me, but now they ask me If they can kiss me. Get some fame, people change Wanna live they life high. Same song, can't go wrong If I play the nice guy. Claimin' fame, must have changed. Now that we became strong I remain, still the same 'Cause it's the same song. All around the world, it's the same song Brenda. Got a. Baby. So, what's up, dog? You got the second verse for us or what? Shit, man. Hell, You ready for it or what? Come on, man. Let's hear some. Let's get to it. - Watch and learn, midgets. - Your mom's a midget. Fuck you, Money B. Kick that, Shock. Brenda. Got a. Baby. I hear Brenda's got a baby. But Brenda's barely got a brain. A damn shame. The girl can hardly spell her name. That's not our problem That's up to Brenda's family. - It still ain't right. - L've been on this two hours. Two hours or 10 hours, we gonna do this shit till we get it right. You understand that shit? Yo, Pac. Chill, man. We'll just come back tomorrow and do this shit, dog. Tomorrow ain't promised to no man, Shock. Now double my vocals up and make that shit sound big. - This is my music! - But it won't line up. It ain't supposed to line up! All right? I want you to feel every stutter, every breath. I don't want this shit polished. I want it raw. Now stack that shit! Tell his ass, Money. Man, just give him what the fuck he wants. - Goddamn! - I hear you, man. Raise the fuckin' piano chords. The girl can hardly spell her name. That's not our problem That's up to Brenda's family. Well, let me show you how it affects our... That's what I'm fuckin' talkin' about. Now you got that shit. You hear that shit? Exactly. It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know... So at the time, did you know that album would make you a star? My mindset wasn't to become a star. But it was your big break, right? That wasn't even my big break. That happened by accident. I was on the set, my boy was tryin' to get the part, I'm fuckin' around with the lines and I ended up gettin' the part. Crazy, man. You know what? When you said that last time, I was kind of tripping, right? But now, you're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about you. I don't give a fuck about Steele. And I don't give a fuck about Raheem, neither. I don't give a fuck about myself. All right. Cut! Let's go again. Right away again, from the top. I ain't shit and I ain't ever gonna be shit. Pac, we cut. Again from the top. You cool? I'm good. All right. Let's do it again. All right. You're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about you. I don't give a fuck about Steele. I don't give a fuck about Raheem, neither. I don't give a fuck about myself. I ain't shit, and I ain't ever gonna be shit. So as soon as I decide that you ain't gonna be shit... POW! Wow. It's amazing, Pac. You're on your way. Remember that, motherfucker, 'cause I'm the only one y'all need to worry about, partner! Do you think that later on the role of Bishop somehow seeped into your personal life? Nah. I drew on my personal life you know, from things that I was going through to play Bishop- It didn't change you at all? It just changed the opportunities I had. You feel me? Ted Field's. Yo. This scrub. Excuse me? Can I get your autograph? - You know who I am? - I love your album. Is that right? Of course you can get my autograph, young lady. - What's your name? - Danielle. You're awesome. Thank you, Dannie, you just made my day. - Tupac. Ted Field. - What's goin' on, man? Welcome to lnterscope. I see you have met my daughter, Danielle. So, what's your favorite song, Danielle? Don't be shy, honey. I Don't Give A Fuck. Hey, that's a song, man. It's off the album. Homework, yes? - Follow me? - Hey, guys. Glad you could make it, Tupac. Welcome, welcome. We love your music, Tupac. You paint a picture for the listener. It's not always pretty, but it's real. It makes you feel, and that's what good music does. I appreciate that. You're welcome. Now, we do have a couple of thoughts, however. Little stuff. Like, maybe a couple of the tracks that just we could hold off on for now. Like what? Brenda's Got a Baby. So, you know who I am, and you know my music, and you think that I would actually scrap that song? Well, to be blunt, Brenda's Got A Baby is depressing. It's real. Like you said. With all due respect, it's about a 12-year-old who gets molested. Nobody wants to listen to that. It's about a 12-year-old that gets molested by her cousin, ends up pregnant, gives birth to a baby on a bathroom floor, has to turn to drugs and prostitution, just to put food on the table, and ends up murdered in the streets? That's a marketing nightmare. And it's probably why all the other labels have passed. See, people just wanna be entertained. Well, I admire that you know the lyrics to the song. But also with people wanting to be entertained, there are people that wanna be heard. And that's where I come in. And I'm reporting from the streets. I'm educating and keeping it real on what's going on out here, all right? Do you know where Brenda came from? The New York Post. Every day, I read about that story, and every day, that story got smaller and smaller. You know why? 'Cause it's the hood and white America don't give a shit about the hood. Now, we understand that there are issues in the inner-city. There ain't no inner-city, Ted. It's the outer-city. You know why? 'Cause we're left out of everything. When you're born, you're born into a dynasty or an empire. You know what I'm sayin'? With the family crest and the family heirlooms. Our family crest is cotton. We don't have no family heirlooms. None of that shit. So the only thing that we can leave behind is our culture and our music. Interscope was founded on artistic freedom. We're an artist-friendly label and we support your vision... I don't just need you to support it, I need you to understand it. Let's try this. Let me play this shit back for you, all right? Let's pop your new set of ears on, all right? And see if you can get with this. Pretend you're in a church, - and the Rev is preaching. - I'm Jewish. Well, Shalom and L'chaim on this shit. Feel me? In love with a molester Who's sexing her crazy. And yet she thinks that He'll be with her forever. - You feel that, don't you? - I hear. You ain't never heard shit this deep! No, we have not heard shit this deep. That's right, Ted. We'd like you to come be a part of lnterscope. - Welcome aboard, sir. - Congratulations. That's what I'm talkin' about. Momma can't help her. But it hurts to hear her calling. Brenda wants to run away. Momma say, you making me lose pay. There's social workers here every day. Now Brenda's gotta make her own way... The album dropped, the film was released, and life started to change. Look, you're gonna be all right, Mama. You're strong. Thank you, baby. - I love you. - I love you, too. I have it on good authority that the FBI has a 4,000-page file on you. Only 4,000? That mean I'm being targeted then, right? Hey. What the fuck's your name, boy? What the fuck you stoppin' me for? I said, what the fuck's your name? Tupac. Tupac Shakur. Your real name. That is my real motherfucking name. And what do you want? This ain't South Africa. - Up against the car. - Get the fuck up off me! What the fuck do you want? Jaywalking, asshole. You know what you did! Man, give me my goddamn citation! Up against the wall! Come on! It's Tupac! You need probable cause and jaywalking does not fall under the scope of Penal Code Section 836! Wise-ass! REPORTER". Rapper and actor Tupac Shakur claims he was choked, beaten, and had his face smashed into the pavement by Oakland police after being stopped last night for jaywalking. You called America "the biggest gang there is." You give money to militant groups. Your stepfather helped your godmother, Assata Shakur, escape jail, and your lyrics don't exactly engender love from the law enforcement community. Of course not. And then there was that incident in Marin County. All the festival and shit. Good. - Crazy, though. - Hell, Damn, little brother, look at the honeys! Kid! Look at this gem right here. She's bad as shit. She cold as a motherfucker. And she's shakin' it. Ain't she? Swishing for a nigga, you see her? I could wife that. I could wife that. - Hey, yo, man. - What's up? I loved Juice! Bishop was a bad motherfucker! I appreciate that, man. Sign this for me? This nigga think he's all that. You a star now, nigga? I'm just out here with my people. You feel me? Your what, nigga? 'MY People. 'Your people? These ain't your goddamn people, nigga. You ain't never did shit for the hood, nigga. Bullshit. Fuck you, you ol' fake Hollywood ass? Fuck you. "Ain't done shit for the hood"? Nigga, I rep the hood every motherfuckin' day. I'm out here, nigga, I ain't hiding. And I'm tryin' to have fun, but bullshit niggas like you wanna start shit. My nigga, you the one that's bullshit, nigga! You got the same 24 hours I do, partner. What, you mad 'cause another man ain't doin' for you? You could be out here doin' for your own, nigga, but you in my face, fuckin' with me, looking for a hand out. Poor... "Poor" what? Goat mouth motherfucker. Sucker-ass niggas. Get the fuck out of here with that shit! Get this nigga, man! Come on! Come on, Pac! Tupac. You all right? I'm good. You know what I can't understand? Is how that incident could possess you to go to a... tattoo parlor and get that "Thug Life" tattoo. "Thug Life" is an acronym. The hate you gave little infants... - Fucks everybody. - Fucks everybody. I know. I've seen you on TV. But what does it mean? 'Cause, Pac, it has to be more than just an acronym. You need to have a plan. I mean, this is a brilliant opportunity to bring together the revolutionaries and the gang communities under a code of conduct. And you can unite them. We gotta create a movement for our community, make sure our people stay safe. When the US send they troops in, they send in thugs. When the police come knockin' at your motherfuckin' door, that's thugs. You trying to start a positive movement for black people by using negative symbolism like "thug" and "outlaw". Come on. See, unlike you, my constituents ain't Booker T. Washington motherfuckers. They're hustlers, street soldiers, mothers trying to get off welfare. Feel me? You got to enter in somebody's world in order to lead them out. I'll buy that, but just not from you. So you're not buying it from me? No. And why is that? After that incident, what was your next hit? It sure wasn't anything conscious. It wasn't Brenda's Got A Baby, was it? - You're right, so... - No, no. So I can't have some fun on my records? - What was it? - It was I Get Around. Now, see, you're a walking contradiction. I ain't no walking contradiction. No, you told me, you're talking about "Thug Life" is this, or power to the people, but... What's wrong with that? I'm talkin' to my people. Now, just because you can't understand it, don't mean there's something wrong with me. Feel me? 'Cause every brother ain't a brother. [ Rapping 1 Stronger than ever. Back to get wrecked, all respect. To those who break their neck To keep their hoes in check 'Cause, they sweat a brother majorly. And I don't know why Your girl keeps pagin' me. She tell me that she needs me Cries when she leaves me. And every time she sees me. She squeeze me Lady, take it easy. Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me I don't want it if it's that easy. Hey, yo, bust it, baby got a problem. Saying bye-bye. Just another hazard of a fly guy. You ask why, don't matter My pockets got fatter. Now everybody's lookin' for the latter I saw your video with all them hoochie mamas in it. Those are church-going women you're talking about. I suppose that's holy water in the tub? The next time, why don't you come out show 'em how to rap? You know? I know you lost your mind. Hold on. Sorry, that was my publicist. Your publicist? That's who that was? How you here right now? - What are you doing here? - Look at you, all Hollywood. - I gotta get like you. - You're Hollywood. You're about to drop another album, do another movie. You know how I roll. You know... - Comin' up. - You a big shot now. How's your mom? - How's your mom? - She's straight. She good. She's strong, you know. Should have been here. I got stuff all over. - I got you. - You gonna hit me with that? You supposed to come out, but it's cool. I'm gonna call one of my church-goin' home girls to come kick it with me at the session. You do that. Bye. - Hey. 'Bye. What? Just remember I love you, scrub. I ain't no scrub. We ride or die. Come on. Hey, let me check somethin'. Don't! - Hey, Pac, what's up, man? - Whassup? - What's up, man? - All right? What's up, man? All right? Good seem' you too, man. What's up, y'all? My baby. Hey, baby. How are you, Aunt Linda? I'm good. Let me take a look at you. - Where's she at? - She in the house. Come on, I'll take you to her. All that dancing tire you out? What you mean, tire me out? I still got a couple of moves left. Shit. I'm just messin' with you. How you doin' though, Mama? You good? I'm just taking it... one day at a time. Trying to keep it all together. You always got it together. I'm good. Setch is good. I wouldn't be the man I am without you. Thank you. Look at you. I'm so proud of you. Pac, they in there talking about you on the TV. Come on. Those that produce these type of records have a responsibility. The Vice President knows your record. It was fundamentally wrong. I hope they have recognized their mistake and I hope in the future that they will exercise better responsibility or concern... Turn that off. For what these records will do on the street. Baby“. I'm worried about... Ain't nothin' to be worried about. Like all Black leaders, you have a bulls-eye on your back, - and today it just got bigger. - But I ain't no Black leader. Not yet. Your mama's right. This is the same shit that happened to Geronimo. And how you not a Black leader? The Vice President was just talkin' about you on the TV! Baby, you have to understand. With the Panthers, it wasn't that we had guns, or black leather. It was because of our message. We were transforming minds! They are gonna come after you with everything you love! They gonna give you the tools that you need to destroy yourself. ATRON". New York City, what's happenin'? How y'all feeling tonight? We are glad to be here.

God damn. - What's up, Tron? - Your phone broke? Shit. No, it's off. God damn! Somewhere we can talk in private? This is from the lawyers. The retainer's been depleted.

Maybe we should hold off on sending funds to your family and... Hell, no. That's mandatory. Is room service mandatory? Are they mandatory? Good mornin'. Shakur's private life has drawn more attention than his music. The rapper has been arrested 10 times since 1991. The release of his first album came one month after a 6-year-old boy was killed by a stray bullet after Tupac got into a fight. The first album went platinum. The second album went platinum. There's marketing. There's sample clearances. There's unit sales and returns to... Ain't nobody returnin' my shit! But they have to be reconciled. It's all very complicated... Y'all makin' this shit complicated! As I said, Tupac, it all just has to get reconciled first. Reconcile me a fuckin' check! You got that shit? Hey, there, man. Y'all set?

Man! - God damn! - We'll chop it up. - Appreciate that, man. - Let you get back to business. Atron. - That's a lot of money. - Hell, But, Pac, what's fat boy really buying? At this point, I don't give a fuck. Look, Pac, this nigga ain't who you think he is... Hey, man! All the shit I got goin' on, court cases and all that, and you worried about this fuckin' money? I'm down to get paid, Pac, but this... In Washington D. C., a coalition of black women have added its support to the growing outrage over a particularly angry form of rap music. There are three things wrong with "Gangsta Rap" and misogynist lyrics. It is obscene. It is obscene. It is obscene. Hip-hop ain't from her generation. Well, maybe it's not hip-hop she had a problem with. Maybe it was being called "bitch" and "nigga" she got fed up with. All right, if that's true, she could've hollered at me, she could have hollered at any of the other rappers she got at in that interview. I don't disagree. Okay? But you do acknowledge that there is a gap between the Civil Rights generation and the hip-hop generation? Yes, a big fuckin' gap. But gettin' at us in the media without fucking talking to us ain't gonna change shit. Come on, Pac. You really don't think that there is at least some relationship between your objectification and treatment of women and how you ended up in here? Fuck you. All right, look. So they say that I don't love women. - No! - Right. They say I degrade women. Nd.! - Do y'all agree with that? - No! Y'all smarter than that, right? Y'all college students. Y'all know better than that, right? So, this one's for y'all. This one for the ladies. Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots I give a holla to my sisters on welfare 2Pac cares, if don't nobody else care. And I know they like to beat you down a lot. When you come around the block Brothers frown a lot. But please don't cry Dry your eyes. Never let up Forgive but don't forget. Girl, keep your head up. And when he tells you you ain't nothin'. Don't believe him. And if he can't learn to love you. You should leave him 'Cause sister, you don't need him. And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up I just call 'em how I see 'em. You know what makes me unhappy. When brothers make babies. And leave a young mother to be a pappy. And since we all came from a woman. Got our name from a woman And our game from a woman. I wonder why we take from our women. Why we rape our women Do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women. Time to heal our women Be real to our women. And if we don't we'll have a race of babies. That will hate the ladies That make the babies. And since a man can't make one. He has no right to tell a woman. When and where to create one. So will the real men get up I know you're fed up, ladies. Put your hands up in the air. Keep ya head up. Child, things are gonna get easier. Keep ya head up. Child, things 'll get brighter. Y'all sound so good! Child, things are gonna get easier. Child, things 'll get brighter. Thank you, ladies, for the sounds! See this nigga, man? You got, like, three car loads in back of us, man! I love Atlanta, man! It's enough to go around, right now.

How the fuck was I supposed to know they was cops? Shit, you're blessed, playboy. - You're a lucky dude, Pac. - Hell, Look, I thought they was just a couple crazy motherfuckers fuckin' with a brother. And in a way, they was. Feel me?

Okay. You talk to Nigel's lawyer? They straighten this shit out? The judge just approved his motion to sever. Motion to sever? Motherfuckers! It means Nigel gets his own fucking trial. They're tryin' to isolate him. You're facing the charges on your own. How the fuck can he do this shit? With very powerful friends. Tupac! Is the accused in the courtroom? Yes. Could you please point him out? I love women. And women love me. I don't have no need, no reason to be raping no woman. And I wasn't raised that way. There wasn't no evidence found against me, I ain't guilty. Why am I the only one in court right now? Why the camera's all on me? And in the report and all these charges? I didn't do nothin'. I'm charged with being in concert with some guys. But where they at? Why me? 'Cause I'm Tupac? No, I'm not angry at them. I'm angry at the system. I don't want nobody else to go to jail, know what I'm sayin'? But I don't wanna go to jail for something I didn't do. I just don't wanna be the scapegoat. You know what I'm sayin'? It's like the only way I know how to live my life is to be responsible for what I do. I don't know... I say somethin' else... - Get this money, nigga. - That's right. It's a lot of money on this table, yo, you better not steal shit. Hold up, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Turn that TV up, playboy. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Y'all know me to be a business man... Turn up the TV. Because you find me in my places of business. You don't just find me anywhere, you know what I'm sayin'? It's like... I don't understand this. Mr. Shakur also recently told. The New York Post he blames this entire case on hangers on. Shakur... Shit. I'm a hanger on now, right? Y'all hear this bullshit? I gave that little nigga his first Rolex! Y'all know goddamn well Pac gonna be here next week asking me for bitches and money. Fuck that bozo-ass nigga. I should have been fried his ass some.

Fuck what that nigga Nigel takin' about. I'm on him! ATRON". Paid as many bills as we could. Promoters are canceling right now, Pac. This damn rape case is killing us, too. I didn't rape nobody! I know you didn't rape nobody. But perception is reality. The picture that you paint with your pen, that's your truth. But the picture the media paints, that's theirs. What about Higher Learning? They wanna go in another direction. What? They dropped you from the movie, Pac. Bullshit! Where you going, Pac? Pas! Hello? Yo, Pac, coming by tonight? You got my money? 'Cause I ain't goin' nowhere if you ain't got my paper. Man, that 7,500 we talked about. I'm on my way. Yo, Pac, man, how many verses you gotta do for this nigga? One verse? Full song?

Call my mom! Pas! Come on, Big, let's go, man! Relax. Shortly after midnight, at 12:25 a.m., on Wednesday morning, Tupac Shakur was shot five times as Mr. Shakur was on his way to a recording studio on the eighth floor of the Powers Building. I believe that this was a robbery. They said, "Give up the jewelry and get on the floor". Tupac resisted. The other three complied. REPORTER". Chief, when you say "resisted", what did he do? He refused to go down on the floor... and said something back? He resisted and a struggle ensued, and that's when the shots rang out. No visitors, Big. C'mon, man. That's my man, dude. Only family. Y'all can't be serious, man? Come on, man. Get your hand off of me, man. What you mean? Come on, dog. What you doin', man? Mom. Y'all trippin', man. Stop following me, man. Y'all niggas trippin', man. Get me outta here. Baby, okay. It's okay. It's okay. We have security. You're safe here. It was a set up. Just hours after surgery, rapper Tupac Shakur checked himself out of Bellevue Hospital against doctor's orders. He is due to appear in court later this week. Can you move, please? Were you set up, sir? Are you innocent? Can you move? Get the fuck... Damn. You're bumping into my wheelchair, man! Mr. Shakur. Your hat. On the counts of rape and sodomy, how do you, the jury, find the defendant? Not guilty. On the counts of sexual abuse and unlawful touching, how do you, the jury, find the defendant? Guilty. Court will recess until February 8th, 1995, for sentencing. Court's adjourned. Mr. Shakur, please stand for sentencing. Mr. Shakur, I sentence you to a minimum of 18 months and a maximum of 4 years. This is beyond excessive, Your Honor. Let me finish, Mr. Warren. The sentence is to be served at a maximum-security prison. Maximum security? For illegal touching! Counselor! Counselor, one more outburst and I will hold you in contempt. Mr. Shakur, would you like to address the court before you're taken into custody? Your Honor, throughout this entire case, you haven't looked me in my eyes once, but you've spent hours pouring over my tattoos, days debating about what my lyrics mean, still never looking at me, the man, the person. It's obvious you're not in search of justice, so there's no point in me asking for a lighter sentence. As far as I'm concerned, there's no justice being served here. So do what you wanna do 'cause I'm not in your hands. I'm in God's hands. Bailiff. [ Crying 1. Wait! I'm gonna be all right, Mama. I'm all right. I'll be all right. All right. Hold down, little brother. I shall not fear no man, but God. Though I walk through the valley of death. - Let's go, ladies. - Let's go, let's go. Back of the bus. Let's go, let's go! Move it, move it, move it. Back in elementary, I thrived on misery. Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed. Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest. Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest. Tell me can you feel me? I'm not living in the past. You wanna last be the first to blast... Let's go, big boy. Come on! Well, if it isn't the superstar. Turn around, nigger. You heard him. Do it, nigga. Turn your black ass around. Do it! Fucking issue? Let's go. Eyes front. Keep moving! Lord! I lost so many peers And shed so many tears. Now that I'm struggling in this business. By any means. Label me greedy gettin' green But seldom seen. And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed I'm having visions of Leaving here in a hearse. God, can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure. And all the pain. Show me some happiness again I'm going blind I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well. Go around the corner. Let's go. Let's go! I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail? - Not you. - What the fuck you doin'? You stay the fuck there and don't move! - What the fuck you doin'? - Stop talking! What the fuck you doin', man? Bitch-ass motherfucker! Piece of shit, motherfucker. Let's talk about your life right now. Your latest album, Me Against The World, debut at number one on Billboard. Congratulations. Thank you. You're the first artist in history to have a number one album while in prison. Now, do you think that you'd be on top of the charts if you weren't locked up? - Of course. - You're on appeal. Bail is set for $1.4 million. You're sitting here in jail, right now, talking to me. Tupac Shakur can't post his own bail? Who did you want to speak to? Ted Field. I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now. Okay, well, can you get his ass out the meeting? I'm sorry, Mr. Shakur. I'll have to take your number and he'll call you back. Take my number? I'm in fuckin' jail! Come on, motherfucker. Save that goddamn thug life shit for the streets, you understand me? Just another nigga up in this motherfucker. Well, all that Black Power and all that, man. I'm from the West Coast, I already know what's up. And I'm from B.K., man, you know how we do it. I'm tryin' to tell you, right now... Nah. Turn that shit back on! Turn it back up. Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete. Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets. It's on, nigga. Fuck all that bickering beef I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek. Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet. Thundering, shaking the concrete. Finish it, stop, when I foil the plot. Neighbors call the cops Said they heard mad shots. Saw me in the drop Three in the corner, slaughter. Electrical tape around your daughter. Old school new school need to learn though. Fuck! I burn, baby, burn like Disco Inferno... Loyalty is everything. Ya-yo. Peel more skins than Idaho potato. Yo. The lyrical molestin' is takin' place... Turn the motherfucking music down. I make your skin chafe Rashes on the masses. - Who you talkin' to, homie? - I'm talkin' to you, nigga. You know this nigga? Turn that fuckin' music down. Hey, you know what? Hold up, hold up, hold up. Let me holler at you, young blood. Let that shit go. Don't let that shit take you off somewhere. Let it go. How the fuck am I supposed to let that shit go? He's tellin' me he had something to do with this shit! You don't even know what year he wrote that shit in. Fuck that. He knows what the fuck he doin'!

We're trying, but... HO. Lift your head up. Son, let me see your spirit. Now, lift your head up. How they treating you in here? You know. I do. Mama, I'm sorry - that you gotta come here... - l... I should be the one apologizing to you. It's not you who put me in here. It was me. You were right. Just like the Panthers. They gave me all the tools to destroy myself. That's the system they run. And I fell for it. Excuse me, ma'am. I am so sorry. I'm sympathetic towards your need to touch this nice young man, but the rules won't allow for it. I'm so sorry. Please, no touching. Thank you. Come here. When I was in jail, pregnant with you, they treated me like less than a human. No real food to eat, no proper nourishment, no medical treatment, this place... This motherfucking place is designed to destroy you. Your body is in prison, not your mind. "And above all else, "to thine own self be true, "And as sure as the night follow the day, "Thou canst then not be false to... - "Any man." - "...any man." That Shakespeare... I can always count on you, Mama. You are appreciated. When I was young. Me and my mama had beef 17 years old. Kicked out on the streets. Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face. Ain't a woman alive. That could take my mama's place. Suspended from school. And scared to go home, I was a fool. With the big boys breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister. Over the years. We was poorer than the other little kids. And even though we had different daddies. The same drama. When things went wrong we'd blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused. It was hell. Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell. And who'd think in elementary. Hey, I'd see the penitentiary one day? And running from the police, that's right. Mama catch me Put a whoopin' to my backside. And even as a crack fiend, Mama. You always was a black queen, Mama. I finally understand for a woman. It ain't easy trying to raise a man. You always was committed. A poor single mother on welfare. Tell me how you did it. There's no way I can pay you back. But the plan is to show you That I understand 213-555-0137. Three million dollars. One per album. Up front. And a house for your mom. That's it? Money ain't a thing. What you need is guidance. I already got a manager, man. I'm not sayin' you can't have friends, but I'm the one that's gonna be there with you 24/7, 365. So it should be me. Death Row ain't a label. It's a way of life. Where's Atron at right now? Are they here? Or are they out there beggin' the white man for your money? Your money. It's real simple. A lot of people are born males, but they're not men. I'm a man. Nobody fucks with me. Nobody fucks with my money and nobody fucks with my family. And if they do... I know you heard the rumors. But I want you to understand one thing. Results. All right. - So when can we do this? - When can you sign? Nigga, show me the pen. This is my pen right here. We got a deal, baby. Big Suge'?- - Hey! - Whassup with it?

Dre putting it down for Californ-i-a. - California knows how to party. - California knows how to party. - California knows how to party. - West Coast. Whenever you're ready, Pac. Shake it, shake it, baby... Right after the hook. Shake it, shake it, shake it, Cali. Out on bail, fresh out of jail California dreaming. Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screaming. Fiending for money and alcohol. The life of a Westside player. Where cowards die and the strong ball. Only in Cali where we riot Not rally to live and die. In LA we wearing Chucks not Ballys. That's right. Dressed in Loos and Khaki suits. And ride is what we do. Flossing, but have caution We collide with other crews. Famous because we program Worldwide. Let them recognize From Long Beach to Rosecrans. Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside. So you know the row won 't bow down. To no man. Say what you say. But give me that bomb beat from Dre. Let me serenade the streets of LA. From Oakland to Sac-town The Bay Area and back down. Cali is where they put their mack down. Give me love!

It is what it is. That nigga about his business. All right, hold up. Can I get everybody's attention? Like I'm always tellin' y'all, Death Row is more than a label. It's a family. And tonight, we got one of our members back, fresh off acquittal. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. And we have a new family member, Tupac. Nobody's ever did what we doin'. No other label has put out this many platinum albums at the same time. And when Pads album drops, the first ever double rap album... Hell, ain't no tellin' where we going. We got here today, by trusting one another. By being a family. By being loyal. Like my man here. Ronnie, you hungry? - No, I'm good, Suge. - No, have some more. - I'm good, I'm full. - How about a steak? I'm full, I'm full. I'm good. Now you full? I guess you're done taking from my plate? You've been stealing from me for months. Why stop now? Tape costs. Studio time. Musicians. This motherfucker spent 250 grand on an artist that ain't even mine! You think I wouldn't find out? You think I'm a bitch? That I was just gonna let that slide? Answer a man when he's talking to you! That's not me. You must have a problem with mathematics, Ronnie, 'cause this shit don't add up. But, hey, you like to eat good, right? Then eat this shit, motherfucker. There you go. Eat good. Eat that shit! - How does it taste? - I'm sorry! You like that shit? You like that shit?

It ain't like that, man, all right? I've just been busy 24/7. So you did it? I'm with Suge now. Look, Tron, I appreciate you, man. You've done a lot for me. You've helped me along the way. But, right now, I gotta do my own thing. And no man can stay in the same place forever, right? $0 you got rhymes'? You come a long way in a short time, man. Take care of yourself, Pac. No doubt. All right. Bye. Hey, hey, beautiful. Why so cold? Kidada Jones, right? I'm Tupac... I know who the hell you are. I'm surprised you're calling me by my name. - What are you talking about? - Quincy Jones. You don't remember the magazine article? You know the one where you said all my father does is stick his dick in white bitches and make fucked-up kids? I'm one of those fucked-up kids. Look, stop. Can I just get three seconds to apologize? One... Look, I was stupid. I was dumb. I said some dumb shit, all right? Look, I was just trying to make a point on how successful brothers value white beauty over black beauty. It just came out wrong. I say a lotta stuff that just comes out wrong. My big mouth. I got a big mouth. I got a big smile, too, though. Are we done? "We must not hate those who have done wrong to us. "For as soon as we begin to hate them, "We become just like them, "pathetic, bitter, and untrue." Am I supposed to be impressed with Shakespeare? I'm just trying to get you to keep from stooping to my level. You should really try harder. I'm gonna try real hard, baby. I like that one, too. I'm gonna call it Euphanasia. Nah, I'm not feelin' that. Needs to be more about you, like somethin' you feelin'. That's hot. Especially that one. I'm feelin' like everybody watchin' my motherfuckin' moves. All Eyez On Me. - That's it, right there. - Hell, Yo, Suge. What the fuck happened to you? Some niggas jumped me at the mall, homie. Them niggas took my motherfuckin' chain too, blood. Swear if had my strap, I would have laid all them niggas down. Word on the streets, though? Them Bad Boy niggas, them bitch-ass Bad Boy niggas, they got a bounty out on our shit!

Come on! So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars. This life as a rap star ls nothin' without heart. Was born rough and rugged Addressin' the mad public. My attitude was "fuck it" 'Cause motherfuckers love it. To be a soldier. Must maintain composure at ease. Though life is complicated Only what you make it to be. And my ambitions as a rider. To catch her while she hot and horny. Go up inside her. Then I spit some game in her ear. "Go to the tele, hoe!" You put what money in a Benz 'Cause, bitch, I'm barely broke I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial. From player to player. The game's tight, the feeling's mutual. From hustlin' and prayers. To breakin' motherfuckers to pay up I got no time for these bitches 'Cause these hoes tried to play us I'm on a meal-ticket mission Want a mil', so I'm wishin'. Competition got me ripped. On that bullshit they stressin'. House of Blues, make some motherfuckin' noise! Makaveli in this Killuminati. Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air! Y'all know the words, sing it! Hail Mary, run quick, see. What do we have here now? Do you want to ride or die? I ain't a killer, but don't push me. Revenge is like the sweetest joy. Next to gettin' pussy. Picture paragraphs unloaded Wise words bein' quoted. Peeped the weakness in the rap game. And sewed it. Bow down, pray to God Hopin' that he's listenin'. Seein' niggas comin' for me. Through my diamonds, when they glistenin' bless me please, Father I'm a ghost. In these killin' fields Hail Mary, catch me if I go. Let's go deep inside the solitary mind. Of a madman. Screams in the dark. Evil lurks, enemies see me flee. Activate my hate Let it break to the flame. Set trip, empty out my clip Never stop to aim. Some say the game is all corrupt. And fucked in this shit. Stuck, niggas is lucky If we bust out this shit. Plus, Mama told me never stop Until I bust a nut. Fuck the world if they can't adjust. It's just as well Hail Mary. Come with me. Hail Mary Nigga, run quick, see. What do we have here now? Sing that shit, House of Blues! Do you want to ride or die? Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac! Tupac!

Steady gunning Keep on busting at them fools. You know the rules. Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie How I'll leave you. Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces. Now be deceased. Lil Kim, don't fuck around with real G's. Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets. So fuck peace! I'll let them niggas know it's on for life. Don't let the Westside ride tonight. Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed. Fuck with me and get your caps peeled. Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac. Call the cops when you see 2Pac. Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish. Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace. Nigga, I hit 'em up Goldie! You can come, too. Hell, snakeskin. Can I get a minute? All right, look, ladies. Y'all give a nigga a minute. Then bring y'all fine asses back, all right? - Why you tripping? - I'm tripping? You don't see a nigga partyin' and shit? "Claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife"? What is that shit? All right, look, hold on. It ain't even like that. That nigga knows I helped him out with everything. Feel me? Let him rock the mic in my shows, sleepin' on my couch. He owe me more than that, and he just turned his back on me like he didn't know the niggas were fittin' to blow my head off? And Faith? - Casualty of war. - Casualty of war. The fuck has happened to you? What happened to me? I got shot 5 times. That's what happened to me! What happened to you? You used to be down. I'm still down. I'm just not down with this shit. It's stupid. And it's dangerous. It's dangerous getting shot, too. The man I knew wanted to use his voice to educate. To bring people together! That don't mean I gotta lay down and let these motherfuckers kill me! That's what I'm supposed to do? I'm supposed to be one of these "turn the other cheek" motherfuckers? If a nigga comin' at me, he gon' get dealt with. So can nobody tell you nothin'? Not about this. Okay. Fuck! Jada! Thank you. Thanks, man. I didn't think this was gonna happen. - Right. - I'm serious. I called you 50 times. - It wasn't 50 times. - It was. Forty-nine. And I invited you to my show at the House of Blues, and still nothing. I had to think about it. I almost gave up, though. I'm glad you didn't. Me too. To live and die in LA. California. Doesn't matter what you say About Los Angeles. Game! Don't cry. Don't cry. Frank, get your boy. What'd I tell you? Us niggas hustle for the cash So it's hard to knock it. Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin'. Worldwide through the hard times, Worrying faces. Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart. Who was a friend is now a ghost... It sounds good. Thanks. None of this is by accident, right? Someone's getting deep. I'm serious. I mean, whatever we're supposed to be doin' here, we gotta do it, right? You will. You won over my dad and that's not easy. But you don't do what's easy. You do what's right. Feel like I can conquer the world with you, girl. So what brought all this on? I'm fixin' to do my own thing. That completes my contract with Death Row. It's time to be my own man. What's wrong? What's Suge gonna say when you tell him you're leaving? Don't worry about that, all right? That's cool and all, that's cool and all, just make sure, next time, they don't take your new chain, nigga. 'Nigga, What? That shit ain't funny. That shit ain't funny at all. - What up? - What up, Pac? What's goin' on? What up, Suge? - What up, Pac? - Yo, can I get a second? - Let's let them have a minute. - All right, let's move. All right, blood. Everything cool? Everything cool, man. I just finished Makaveli, All Eyez on Me was a double album. So that completes my three albums. Look, big homie, I appreciate everything you've done for me, man. You feel me? You gave a nigga a new life, so I'm always down with you. But I wanna start my own company. Doing music, film, TV shows, all that. Nigga might even start directing. That's cool and all. Far as the commitment side, you're good. You came in on fire and put in work. I appreciate that. I respect that. But let me show you somethin'. As far as the money side, we ain't recouped all that. What we gonna do about that? There's more to this business than just recording records. Pas! Mama! How you doing, son? How you doing? You lookin' good. Thank you. Mama, this is Kidada. Nice to finally meet you. Thank you. It is an honor to meet you, Ms. Shakur. Please, call me Afeni. Would you like some veggie stir-fry? My son's eating vegetables? Yes. I'm getting him off of the hot wings-and-Hennessy diet. Right? You see me coming up in the world? Thank God for you! You're a miracle worker. You know, let me get some waters. You want something? - Water is great. - Okay. Thank you. I'll be back. Just gonna lay the licious on me in front of Mama? You know she got a white mama. This is bigger than all of our apartments back in the day. Good God! And I got heat. Here. Don't gotta sleep in my jacket no more. Lord. You've come a long way, son. Wow. We all have, Mama. How are Setch and the kids? They doing good. The kids ain't so little no more. But... Your sister's a good mom. She takes after somebody I know. Beautiful, smart, and got my son eating healthy. Right. And I know your friends love her, too. She is somethin' special. Yo, Pac. I thought about what you said last night. Man, I thought real hard. Let me chop it up with you for a second. I've been thinkin'. I got somethin' for you I want you to see. It's yours. Death Row East? Why start some new shit when we can expand? Euphanasia will have guaranteed distribution and a bigger platform. I run Death Row here and you get the East Coast. We partners now. You already know how this business is. While you making movies and records, you need somebody to make sure you good. Now what do you say? - Do you believe in God? - Certainly. Then believe in Death Row East. You feel me? Believe in that. It's real. You feel me, look, ain't no other record company sold as many records as us. Death Row East will be a direct personification of what we did on the West Side. But, yo, are you concerned about Puffy and Biggie? Look, if this was chess, we'd be yelling checkmate three motherfuckin' years ago. You feel me? Look, we're coming to the East Coast to prove that there is no fear, but instead opportunity. And opportunity is overthrow the government y'all got right now, which is Nas and Bad Boy and all that bullshit, and we will bring a new government here that will feed every person in New York. It's real simple. You're either with us, or you against us. The East Coast don't love Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg? And Death Row? We know y'all, East Coast. - We know the we at. - East Coast in the house. Snoop. Yo, that was a bold-ass move you did last year at the Garden, feel? Yo, you almost caused a riot. What happened? Talk to me. I did it 'cause I ain't scared of nothin'. And it was real, you feel me? Shit, we grew up listenin' to East Coast rap. We were just tryin' to let 'em know where we was from and what we stand for. Wasn't nothin' but some love, that's it. A'right. We'll put it out on the table. Tell me how you feel about Puffy and Biggie. Man... Puffy and Big? They my homeboys. It ain't like that. They didn't want it like that. Fuck. And we don't need to be doing that. It's all love. - Hey, Suge! - It's cold as fuck. Can't wait to get back to LA. Man, how the fuck Snoop gonna tell the world that them is his homies? Look, calm down. I'm gonna handle it, all right? Calm down? Nigga, whose side is you on? Who the fuck are you yellin' at? I told you to calm your little ass down. I'm gonna handle it. This is my shit, all right? Nigga, you either handle it or I'm gonna fuckin' handle that shit. You watch who the fuck you're talkin' to. Come on, we're all family. Y'all do somethin' about this shit! Don't tell me how to handle my business! Nigga lost his fuckin' mind talkin' to me crazy. They're downstairs talkin' about you. Man, I don't give a fuck. I said what I said. Don't nobody do nothin' until we get there. I'm on the way back to LA right now. Hey, hold on for a second, all right? Hey, we full, homie. You gonna have to fly solo. Hey, y'all gonna have to get on the other one. I'm cool. Y'all go ahead. Mean like a motherfucker. Don't fuckin matter what he said. It only matter what I say.

He's with us! He in the fuckin' car! My man he's been shot! - LAPD. He's with us. - Come on, man. He's a victim! Tupac! Tupac! I'll get his legs. Shit. Come on. - Keep your eyes open, man! - Come on, Pac. Hold on, Pac. Stay with us. Keep your eyes open, Pac. They motherfuckin' shot my nigga, man! Hurry up! Stay with us, Pac. Hold on. Hold on. Keep your eyes open, Pac. It's gonna be all right. Every time I speak I wanna shiver, you know? I don't want them to be like they know what I'm gonna say 'cause it's polite. They know what I'm gonna say. And even if I get in trouble, you know what I'm sayin', ain't what we're supposed to do? I'm not saying I'm gonna rule the world or I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.
