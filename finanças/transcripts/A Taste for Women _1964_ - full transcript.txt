Petticoat, that's your anguish. -Petticoat? Poor boy, do you think it's good for your health? You should watch to someone like Mr Khouroulis. Khouroulis? This one with his smile. His smile? What's wrong with his smile? Nothing. I know what I'm talking about. -You're very nice today. Listen, we'll not gonna argue. What's the story about Mlle Milou? Willou. -Willou. These are not stories, I don't write fairy tales. I watch. That's enough. It doesn't take place here. And I'm not senile yet. I don't see the connection with Mlle Willou. That she didn't beat the big red rug in the garden doesn't seems strange to you? No. It's been 12 years that she beat this big red rug every wednesday. Twelve years? -Twelve years. Every wednesday. Every wednesday, since I've rented her my villa. This old cow. What do you know about it exactly? I tell you, I can see. That must be enough. Anyway there are the screams. -The screams? It's been six days or eight. Screams and especially... I listen to it from my bed. What kind of screams? I don't know. Like pinched children. Pinched children? Tortured. Like howls?

So go. -I go, I go. Anyone there? Anyone there? Anyone there? Mlle Milou? ...Willou? Would you leave please, gentlemen. Did you know the victim? No, not me. So you can't say it is Mlle Willou. No. -Of course. Yes. Me! -You? I would like to see her. I mean I could recognise her. Identify the body. -Identify the body, that's right. Yes? I'll not go to see that? -We have to help the Law. Rocard, escort Madam. -Me again, chief? Oh no, Malleve. Alright, Malleve. Mr Fenouic, Are you sure you couldn't tell me what's missing from this cabinet? I told you I never came here. That's true. A big object according to the mark. All this is very confuse. Ah, this was a grandiose horror. Is it her? - Yes, it's her. Can I take some more of...? -Yes. You'll start with your liver again, Jerome. - What are you talking about? Your aunt is not wrong, if you have a sensitive liver. He persits on not wearing his flannel belt. -Come on, please. That's true the warmth of the flannel is ...perfect. Soft. Penetrating. Ideal. Let's not exagerate. The ideal is by far the laying on. Do you think so? -Yes. Do you mind if I give him a little laying on? Relax yourself completely. Let yourself go. Just like if you were floating. Here it is. Good. Where are you suffering exactly? I'm not suffering. There's no shame to admit your suffering. Relax yourself Mr Fenouic. Lay down your legs. Don't think about anything. Shhhhh! -Sorry. Do you feel? No. Don't your skin tickle a bit? No, it's not tickling me. Think about it Jerome. Is it not tickling you? I tell you, No. If you put your bad will into it, for sure. Mr Fenouic. I got no charges against you. not one. But don't forget that you must stay at the police disposal. Malleve. Escort them back. So Doctor? No doubt, it's the pin. Up to the brain? - Just once. What a destiny. I have to drink something. It's my first murder. Me, it's my third. She's pretty. - Mlle Something? You should see her again. -Who? Violette. So old friend, eating good? And you didn't tell it to Palmer? Here you are, you old crook. Sit down, Leon. I don't want to disturb a dinner for two. Palmer, a great journalist. Former army captain in India. Aunt Flo. Let's kiss aunt Flo. He's tickling me. It stings a bit, but you get use to it. What are you drinking? - That looks good. Joe, same thing. With a Clos Rougeot bottle. It's good. - Funny Jerome. It's perfect. Like Jerome it's a success. - I was talking about the Clos Rougeot. We'll get along together for sure. Are you working at "The Mesange" too? A Trust, Madam, it's a Trust. No, Mademoiselle. Thank God for my freedom. So, Cheers to Freedom, Mademoiselle. Jerome never tells me anything. That's the best one I ever heard. A Daily newspaper I work for, me Palmer... Forget it.

Violette. Yes. Violette. It's you. Yes. -You're here, that's true. Yes. My love. Yes. I love you. I know. What 's your connection to the "Cockatoo" people? Shut up. I want to know. - Shut up. No, I'll not shut up. I have to open your eyes, it's my duty. Do you know what happens at the "Cockatoo"? No, you can't know. You can't even guess. Drug, vice, prostitution. And I must forget some. This is your "Cockatoo". All this ruled by Larsen. A big Gang Boss. A strange animal this one. Violette, come back. Public indecency now. Congratulations. No, I'll explain... No use to comment on this. Would you mind getting dressed? Excuse me, my room is... I got a few questions. Violette, Violette. Your Violette. Inspecteur, this girl...

An arrow. - An arrow? From a blowpipe. - A blowpipe. Poisonned. A poisonned penholder? And this? Damn, I forget it. You making my life miserable, Mr Fenouic. Everywhere you go, there are bodies, strange shout-outs, arrows in cake shops, Pin in the eye. That's not right. That's not right at all. And what's that? Humm, well done Malleve. Thanks Chief. What were you doing with Larsen's mistress? Larsen? Your Violette, don't tell me you didn't know she was his mistress. This damn Larsen that rules everything from his little car. Without getting his hands dirty. No evidence, never. Of course, a cripple. This is messing things up. What's that disguise? A bargeman lend it to me. You dress as a bargeman now? This powder? Isn't it some...? Is it? Rocard! Laboratory. Violette. If only you've seen this. This poor Willou must not had fun, with a pin of that size. It was during Inspector Rossi's questioning. A charming and educated man. A charming Inspector? I know what some say about police. But believe me Mlle Grichter. If you had been questioned by the Inspector Rossi as I was... You'd be sold on. Sold on? Here he comes. Here he comes. Congratulations. What for? For the body discovery. My love, my poor love. You know about it? It impressed him more than I though. it's all over the news. Here, here and there. Mmm... a sadist victim it seems that a glass object...... Inspector Rossi thinks that the missing object from the cabinet... You see, it was to steal her that someone stick that pin. The Inspector Rossi was right. Mr Fenouic. I'd like to talk to you. That we don't know. I've something to tell you. I'm listenning, Mlle. I'd like to do it from mouth to ear. You know, from mouth to ear... Well, I'm out now. See you soon. Don't say anything. I know. The poet can't stand some sights. You should have seen the puppet.

You're persiting to sleep without pyjamas . You're sleeping without pyjamas? He sleep buck naked. -Another mistake. You see. Think hard before to answer. Would you be ready to do a two weeks spiritual retreat stranded from the world. Your future depend on your answer. I'm very busy, I can't answer just like that. Tomorrow may be. Tomorrow it'll be too late. I have to go. Take care of you, honey bear. Damn. I don't have my car. I can drive you home. You don't know in what a cruel dilemma you put me. Me? You, your arches. My arches? This shape is pretty rare. You think so. I do. Are you joking? Rarely. It doesn't mean you're clever. Ah, no? - No. It means you're the One. Dilemma. As sublime as they are, your arches are nothing compared to your lobes. My lobes? I knew it, the One's lobes. The holy ones, so small, so thin. Why, why? Limazalazug. Definitely supreme. Nirvana! Nirvana! You'll be there tonight, sonny. I take one. Do you want to do a retreat with me? No, thanks Mr Khouroulis. See you later. Again? Feel yourselves at home. Don't mind for me. Don't get up.

Learn what? -That you're causing me troubles. Putting your nose in my business. Let's go kids. Pour Whisky on him, like a drunk. Driving your car. Fast, stuck speedometer. Into a wall. Boom! Silence. You'll burn. A terrible death. Burned alive. You planned everything from your little car. Without having to dirty your hands. No evidence, isn't it Larsen? Come on kids, let's finnish with him once and for all. Would you bring Mister's car? Bring the car. I don't want. - Calm down. No, I don't want. -It'll be fast. I don't want anyway. Well done.

He really push too far. -At the lest expected time. Dead drunk. Where are the egg cups? -In the left cupboard. Mlle Richter called many times. Yesterday evening before you arrived. She said it's very important. She left a number you can call. What does she want Mother something? Please, Jerome. Mlle Richter is a very nice person. Call, you'll see. No. You take care about what I asked you? -Promised. A slice of ham? -I'm so hungry. You'll remember? This morning? -Promised. Carved in stone. Violette, blond, 22 or 23, singer, Charleroi, Belgium. I promised you'll call. Do it for me. Can you dial? It's ringing. Mlle Richter? -Yes. Jerome Fenouic. I must see you. - My aunt told me. I must see you, it's urgent. That Much? Asolutely, it's about Mlle Willou's Buddha. The Buddha? I'll explain, be at 3 pm at the St Jean Chrysostome chapel. I'll talk from man to man. The pin. It's me. Pardon? In Willou's Eye. I put it. Don't be stupid. Listen. The countdown's started for you and me. To save the beloved sect I did it under Khouroulis order. We had to take the Buddha back no matter what. The Buddha? The Buddha that Khouroulis sold by mistake to Willou. The buddha that contains all our beloved sect's secret papers. The sect? Nirvana. Don't be naive, Mr Fenouic. That dog fooled me. Instead of secret papers, the Buddha was full of drug. Khouroulis betrayed my faith. Infamous. I kept this Buddha. I said to Khouroulis that it was not at Willou's. But because of you... I did nothing. Yes, because of your noisy discovery of this old witch. All the press talked about it. Before I could negociate the drug. I know you're working for Larsen. No way? I'm ready to deal the drug with him. I'll make a special price. It's about my life. Khouroulis 'll do whatever he can to eliminate me. Don't be so pessimistic, Mlle. So? He got me. Listen, the Buddha is at Jeannine Dupillier. What is it? From Mr Richter. One moment. What is it? Mlle Jeannine Dupillier? Yes, what is it? I come from Mr Richter. Come in. It's there. Excuse me to welcome you like this... I was washing my hair I am sorry to come unexpectedly. Where is it? Up there. I don't see it. Behind the Hat box. Wait. I'm too small. - I can help you. Here it is. How heavy it is this Buddha. Be carefull. I'm so clumsy. What is it? Jeannine, are you there? I'm coming. Follow that car. Violette. I'm here. Violette. It's me Jerome. Shut up, you fool. You're crazy. - Completely. They gonna kill you. I don't care. I beg you. I'll join you at "Joe's" in an hour. Run, for the love of me. I'll be waiting at "Joe's" in an hour. Run. I'm running, I'm running. shit. I admit that I didn't expected it. It gave me a shock. Are you waiting for someone? -Yes. Do you have the informations? -Yes. Singer at Charleroi. She was first witness in an vice affair. Against some Rothman. A lecher. Herman Rothman. The Flanders lecher. What a swine. He was sent to an asylum. Good for him. From wich he escaped six months ago. And about Violette? Do you know anything? For me it didn't last six months. Did you learn something? Ha, yes she was pretty famous at the time, she had a duet with another girl: "The schoolgirls of Love" What was the girl's name? - I don't know. She's free. -That's right. It couldn't last more than 48 hours. She knows what's good for her. I was mistaken. It's after 40 that a woman is really a woman, not before. Are you crazy? Violette is not even 23. I'm talking about Flo It's for you. Hello? Violette? Disconnected. Have you got your car? Yes. -Hurry! After what you told me, it seems extremely foolish. You chicken out? -Not at all, but... Let's go. Go call Rossi. Tell him to come. Quick. I go to take Violette. -You're crazy. Go! Who's there? Step back! Step back! Murderer. Don't touch me. So Mr Larsen. You? Me. 50/50 for all my business. My partner. Shut up! Where is she? Who? Violette. Who's that? Where, Larsen? Where? Don't sting me, don't sting me. Where's Violette? I swear, don't sting. Where's Violette? Bloody hell! Cur. And that? who's that? Isn't it Violette? Marguerite, my baby. Khouroulis took her with all the drug. Traitor. Marguerite. What Marguerite? What Marguerite? Violette. Kidnapped, by the monster and his monkeys. Kidnapped, Marguerite. Fenouic, come back. Mr khouroulis. Mr khouroulis 's not here. What's going on? I want to see Khouroulis. Easy, very easy. You just have to ask. Let's go. What do you want? A Soja cocktail. Jerome. Violette. You came. I'll never leave you again. Sorry Jerome, sorry. What for? If you haven't met me, you would not be attached. My life is different, because I met you. Violette. Now tell me. Are you Marguerite? Does it matter? I want to know who I love. Is it you Violette? I got a twin sister I adore. Nobody can recognise any of us. Even our mother couldn't tell. Once Violette, once Marguerite. My love when mommy died, we did a singing band. It was in Charleroi. it was called "the schoolgirls" She met Larsen at the cabaret. She went to live with him. One day she wrote me a letter in panic. She was calling for help, so I came. She was not with Larsen anymore. So I passed myself off as her. Even Larsen didn't see the difference. I was contacted by a Gustave. He had some informations to sell about my sister for a lot of money. So I stole the money from Larsen. And I came to the Nirvana. where I had to meet Gustave. I should recognise him by his hat. A Prince of Whales check hat with two small feathers Like yours. I understand everything. What do you understand? It doesn't matter anymore. Sing. I don't remember. Yes you do. My sister and me are twins. For always, for 20 years. You say you love me, why not her? If we look exactly the same. I'm jealous in your arms. Feeling infinitely... what she'd lived if it was her. If you became her lover. I don't know anymore wich one I really am. My heart is mad of despair... listenning to your troths. Who do you talk to about your love? Only our first names are differents. One for the night, one for the day Two together can make three lovers. My sister and me are twins. For always, for 20 years. You say you love me, why not her? If we look exactly the same. The sexual instinct is one of the greatest thing you can imagine. You should be dead Mr Fenouic. I don't regret you to be alive. Me either. I'm sure you know who you have to be grateful for this. Matter of luck You've been saved so far, I feel it's a superior sign, that order me to study you closer, as a futur disciple Don't say farewell to the young female now, you'll have plenty of time later. If you'd accepted my retreat proposal, you'd be here under another status. Tonight'll be the ninth moon, you'd be alive or dead, it's doesn't matter. Anyway, you deserve to approach the great mystery. The great mystery? Yes, you deserve it. Do you like women? Yes. I knew it, but you like them badly. And you don't know it. How could you know without being initiated? I've spent 8 years with the supreme master before to know how to really like them. Now I tell you the Nirvana doctrine. Even if you passionately love: a painting, a symphony, a sculpture, a novel or any expression of art, you can't eat it. No way. But the women, work of art graceful, impudent beauty You can, you can. That's impossible. That's impossible. Do you think I'm a child? But why, why? I just told you. Woman, work of art, impudent beauty and it's tasty. We have to admit it, look. It's wonderful. Happy you agree. Wonderful, you said wonderful. No, it was a slip of the tongue. Yes, it slipped. And your tongue'll slip again. It's thinking for you, Jerome. No, that's not true. That's not true. It's a sign, you're on the good way. Give Mister a Cajou. First degree. That's enough. Let's go. So Doctor, still polishing your tools? Well Doctor, all your stuff is tidy today. It look like it. This is Doc Rothman's working room. See how clean it is. Thanks to him. Goodbye, Doc and thanks for letting us. He loves his job. He takes a great pleasure. From me to you, he's a pervert. Of course he's not a sect member. But he 's... -Got magic fingers. I leave you, I go officiate. See you tomorrow. Rothman, does it ring a bell? Yes, why? Tell me everything, with details. It's not worthwhile. Don't you think he kidnapped your sister? But it's me he wanted, not my sister. But you are twins. Anyway Rothman's in an asylum. Hush! For you. You...always nice. Pretty lobes. Pretty lobes. I had to stop the bleeding? It was a tiny cut? Quick, quick! The hat. -The hat. What is it? It's from Mr Khouroulis. I'm coming. I'm standing for Mr Richter. I got a stomach ache. I put my robe and I'm coming. I hope I'm not late. No, no. Look brother There! Quick! Put his costume on. Now leave. Violette. At the top of the corridor, the stairs, the kitchen. Farewell Violette. My love. Ah, my little Jerome'll be happy. Madam. -Leave this. Give this. -Don't touch me. You animal. Caju sirup? Nirvana! -Nirvana! Brothers! one more time the ninth moon is full. It is full!
