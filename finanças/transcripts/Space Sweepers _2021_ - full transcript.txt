Sorry, but I'm a little short. This is real rice. It's gotta be worth something. Should have tried... Damn it! Stupid asshole! The translator is malfunctioning again. You always run out of money when you come here. Ah, come on, guys. Okay, okay. Just wait a s… I just wanna take a quick look. That's all. Is it really so hard? - Come on! You guys make me pay… - There's nothing to see! If it was her, you'd get an alert! How would you know, huh? Let me go! Hey, hey! Just let me in this one time! That's enough. Let him in. But this won't satisfy me. Your magnetic boots are cool. I found them yesterday. Fixed them up myself, you know? I was the only one on my ship without a pair... Take them off. Space shuttle crash. Five days ago in the Kubuqi Desert. Body was in a burnt-out escape capsule. It matches the description. Female, seven years old. But… I told you it wasn't her. You're not gonna find her here on Earth. I think she's already drifted too far. You have money for the transit, Tae-ho? Poor guy. Hope was extinct. The Earth was still breathing, but it was on life support. With Earth no longer habitable, the only place left to go was up. Ladies and gentlemen, we have just entered UTS-governed interplanetary space. Welcome to the orbit. Earth used to be the symbol of life. Space, death. Now, through the miracle of technology, we can go fishing in a stream above the sky. Children are again able to chase butterflies in vast green fields. This is only the beginning for UTS. You all know the voice. Now you will be meeting the man himself. Doctor, physicist, aerospace engineer, historian. He's the wealthiest man in the world, as well as the oldest at 152 years old. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the founder of UTS, the creator of our celestial paradise, the savior of humanity, Mr. James Sullivan. Mr… Mr. Sullivan. The reporters from Earth are here. Ah. Hi. This is genetically-modified Schefflera arboricola. Produces eight times more oxygen than unmodified strains. It's been responding rather well to natural fertilizer. The growth rate is phenomenal. This soil came from the surface of Mars. Can you believe that? Welcome. Only kidding. Please, please. As you are all aware, at UTS, we have been carefully cultivating life on Mars using the tree of life, the Super Plant. Now, in three days' time… …when Mars is at its closest point to the orbit, we will be announcing the grand opening of the new Mars colony. This? This isn't dirty. Human beings are dirty. Their crimes against nature are. Which, I assure you, there will be none of in our new Eden. There's something else that won't be in your new Eden. Ninety-five percent of the human population. They're still living on Earth, which has long turned into a living hell. What about the people left behind? Or the space laborers from Earth? There is a humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes. The purpose of today's press conference... No, no, it's… He's right. This is indeed a crisis which, as a company, we will be addressing. Space is full of trash. Expired satellites, abandoned space vehicles, and leftover space construction materials have collided to form millions of scrap metal parts precariously floating in space. Workers risk their lives to chase down space debris flying ten times faster than a speeding bullet just to be able to afford their next meal. Look. I will be the first to admit that our Eden is not perfect. Yet. But I would happily have a deeper conversation with you about this. Space debris, 1.7 tons. Just crashed with a satellite. Probably came from the Lagrangian Point. Speed's at 7km/sec, still slow. Watch out for the jellyfish. It won't matter what we haul if we nick UTS property. It's going from District D 79.348 to 30. You who hooked the satellite, stay away. That'll cost you at least $800. Easy. Gently. They are not here. Right? - Who? - Who do you think? I heard he went down to Earth yesterday. They can't be back yet. Huh? Sh… - Fuck. - I can't believe this! You said they wouldn't be here! VICTORY Out of my way, you fuckin' amateurs. Let's grab what's ours. Step on it. Victory. Upper deck gravity level 0.8 G's. Magnetic compensation 1.2 Gs. Ah, move aside. I'll show you how it's done. - Stay focused! - Stop them! They're dragging it the other way! Get them! Grab it! You Victory sons of bitches! I'll kill those sons of bitches! - Assholes! - Kill them! My, such dirty mouths. No imagination at all. Is all that swearing really necessary? Hey, Park. They're gaining on us. You heard the bot. Speed it up, Park. I'd like to see one of them come down here and work this thing. Time to wrap it up, guys. They're getting away! Step on it! You better stop before I get really fucking pissed. Just catch them! You are seriously going to take everything? Get lost, Jang! We were here first! Can't you share? Think about the other ships! Damn you! You're confusing me with someone who gives a shit. Solar panels ahead. Alter course. Alter course. Uh, guys, can we stay clear of this? - You're dead if we catch you! - You'll go to hell for this! - Human trash! - We'll get you next time! This shit ain't ethical, Tae-ho! Tell me how that's working for you. Being all ethical, huh? Ah, you are doing good. You're out here busting your asses. Just to make a few lousy bucks, right? I'll fucking kill you. You son of a bitch! Hey. What… What's that? Approaching UTS Residential District 3. - What are you doing? - We're gonna crash! - Turn the ship around! - Oh, shit, shit! Stop! If they had caught us inside UTS, we're dead! - Watch out! - Look out! - Well, there goes the antenna. - What a pain in the ass. Victory. Let me see. Hmm. 210 kilograms of titanium. 480 kilos of reinforced carbon-carbon. Aluminum honeycomb, 17. Other materials, 39. That's a total of $584. - And that car? - The garage is full. However, if you want to take it down from here to Earth, you are going to need to pay an extra 70K for reassembly. If you don't want to pay, you could put it back together yourself. Oh. I see here you broke an antenna off the jelly. You need to pay $1,300 for that. We can deduct it from your money and collect the rest from your account. These here are for your taxes. Pay up. Why show me cash? If you're not gonna pay me, why show me the cash at all? You pig! Give it to me! Hand it over! Hey. This is company money. You better sleep with an eye open. I might pay you a visit. - Anything come in? - Just one. In the Thunderbolt, 12kg of iced pork. Accident on a refrigerator spaceship. You've been looking for her for three years now. What you gonna do? Well, for one thing, I need to keep making money. I'll do anything to earn cash. Seriously, anything. Oh, Tae-ho, there you are! Heard you just came from Earth, huh? Eh, still nothing? Uh, why are you wearing plastic bags on your feet, huh? Oh, how's Captain Jang? Beautiful as ever? She asked me to tell you. For me? What did she say? If you talk to her again, she'll kill you. - All right. - That's good. That's good. - Let's watch TV. - Fine dust. Raging viruses. - Twenty-five, fifty-two. - Gas masks have… Meanwhile, UTS authorities continue to search for Dorothy… - She looks so real. - Have you seen this? …the missing android, which was stolen two days ago by the extremist Black Foxes. Those Black Foxes give me the creeps. To date, no clues have been found. I'm out of here. It may look like an innocent child, but it is actually a devastating weapon of mass destruction. If you encounter Dorothy, do not go near it. - Ciao. - Call 900 immediately. Ah, come on! You built Victory with reinforced duralumin. Installed quantum radar. Top speed 48,000. With 3.2 million pounds of thrust. You've got this beast of a ship. Why can't you make any money? It's all debt, man. A lot of it is just garbage collection shit. Captain Jang went overboard on the modifications. We first got into debt because we had to repair, and then came the fines. And debt only leads to more debt. But you guys have good teamwork. Teamwork, my ass. We're all hanging by a thread. Check! Damn. "Seven, three." I'm screwed. You guys are betting chump change. Stop overthinking it. Hurry up! I'll double it. Whoa, $10! What a jackpot. I'll see that, and add two more. I'm out. Can you shut your mouth for once? I don't have a mouth. Joke's on you. What are you all angry at me for? That's it. I'm done after this round. It's no fun. Everyone's so on edge. There's something I need to say to everyone here now. Sure, but if it's about me, I don't wanna hear it. Feeling lucky today. All in. Someone's taken the rice. I've been saving it for a special occasion. First, it was a toolbox. Then, it was the battery. I think some asshole here has been stealing stuff from the ship to make extra money on the side. Captain Jang, can't imagine that booze is cheap. I'm sure a bottle costs at least 80. Shut up. I'm in, come on. I'll raise you ten. Change the subject fast, huh? I guess you like to insult my intelligence. The old me would've already strung you up to keep others from getting ideas. Are you losing your fucking mind or what? Wanna find out who really gets strung up? Oh, remember the grace period for our loan is up. We have to pay 2,000 in a month going forward. Didn't we get an extension on that? What's our remaining balance? By now, it should be about… Let's see. Maybe, $16, $17,000? Not to mention the nine grand we owe the union. I'm gonna find out who the thief is today, no matter what you do. I don't have a clue what you're talking about. Now, if you'll excuse me, this is a big hand. We also received a notice of seizure from the court. It's a financial disaster. Bubs, please! You don't have to tell me things I don't ask about, okay? All right, sure. There was one more thing, but I'll stop there. What is it? Our money manager ran away. - What? - Remember Piggy's dad, who had the fund? Anyway, the guy ran off. We found out about it while you went down to Earth. Guess we forgot to tell you. - What are you talking about? - All right, show your cards! Looks like I won again. I'm getting a little bored at this. Captain Jang, you knew about this? I thought… You said we could trust this guy. We invested all our money with him, and he runs away? - We gotta play again tomorrow. - Shit! We lost 100,000! That was all we had! You think I'll go easy on you 'cause you're the captain? - Where's my money? - Where's my rice? Captain Jang! Oh, sorry. Too slow. One, two, step over you. TOUCH THIS AND I'LL BREAK YOUR WRIST Fined for satellite damage. 720, has been withdrawn. Remaining balance, zero. That's a lot of zeros. One, two, three. Jeez, skin is freaking expensive. Whenever I caught a thief, I'd cut off both hands. I kept one and sent the other one to his boss. Ah, Park's talking about the old days again. Why doesn't he tell it to his therapist? That's Tiger Park to you, rust bucket. Where are those hands now, if you kept some? - Don't believe me? - I believe you. I do. I just want one for myself. That's all. Graphene titanium. Sharpest ax in the world. One hand for you, one hand for me. Hey, cut the chatter, and let's get some work done. Ugh. I should've taken the day off. You know, I'm surprised this ship is in such good condition, if it came from Lagrangian Point. Shouldn't the nanobots have eaten it up by now? Ugh. What if they spread to us? What are you afraid of? They're already everywhere. But we don't have these nanobots. Lagrangian nanobots are invincible. They don't even die. I'm telling you. If these get aboard, all of us will die. Don't you worry about that. I will starve to death long before that happens. Do you think poverty makes us bad or that we're poor because we're bad? If all of you starved to death, I'd transfer ownership of this ship to me, and... - Huh? - What's that? A missing child. Great. We can forget about getting any work done. Police will drag us around. They'll nitpick everything and find an excuse for more fines. Projected profit loss, $7,300. - This is so annoying. - What a headache. If we find her parents, think they'd pay us? Hey. Are you a UTS citizen? She doesn't have a translator device. Uh, are you a UTS citizen? - Huh? What's UTS? - Oh, are you Korean? Does your family have a big house? Lots of stuff? I don't have a home. Can you give me some food, please? I'm getting hungry. Hey, kid. Shut it. You've got some nerve, huh? Ugh, not even a thank you. You found her in the cabin? Yes, between the air bags in the cargo bay. I'm surprised that she survived. But that funny little bowl cut looks familiar for some reason. Su-ni! Now, where did my Su-ni go? Oh, there she is! Ah, I found my little girl. We'll take her to the security center as soon as we fix the ship. Meanwhile, UTS authorities continue to search for Dorothy. - You sure we haven't met? - I'm sure. The android was last seen two days ago with the Black Foxes, who allegedly planted a compact hydrogen bomb in its hardware. This is what the weaponized robot looks like. The innocent face masks a deadly weapon. The robot is highly lethal. Extremely dangerous. It poses a great danger and could be used to terrorize the entire UTS. Get down! Huh? - Huh? - Huh? Huh? Move! Move! No! No! Stay back! No, no! What's up with that kid? That kid is a fucking bomb. No wonder. That's why we couldn't get a reading. Her skin grafts looks so real. Wow! Hey, look out. She's on the move. The bomb won't go off if she gets upset? Shut up and call up the cops. Nine, zero, zero. Thank you for calling the UTS Crime Hotline. If you are a citizen, press one. Non-citizens, press two. Non-citizen. Why don't you tie her up outside the ship, Bubs? Me? Why do you always ask me to do the dangerous stuff? Press 14 for miscellaneous crimes. Is this miscellaneous? Well, one of us has to do it. Rock, paper, scissors? Rock, paper, scissors. Whoa! Whoa! Oh… Stay back. No, no, don't come near me! - I spilled, and I wanted to wipe it up. - Shut your mouth. - How did he screw that up? - What a moron. Oh, dear. Don't… don't even look at me. And don't take any deep breaths. You better not get attached, okay? I'm not a good person. Huh? That's one convincing robot. That thing gives me the creeps. What's all that? WRITING KOREAN "Kang Hyeo-nu"? Who's that? "UTS," huh? "Kang Hyeo-nu." Tons of missed calls. Last one made just now. I gotta talk about this, guys. - Don't blow up! Don't blow up! - Ay, ay, ay! You called the cops? Yeah, but the bastards had me on hold all day. - Will they come? - No way. Time to listen up, you guys. Two Black Fox were shot by the Space Guards while running away with the kid. One of them is dead, but the other one escaped. The kid entered Lagrangian Point on her own, so both the Space Guard and the Black Fox are looking for her everywhere. Hm? Uh, does this story have a point? 'Cause I'm getting bored. I'm telling you. We can use her to make some real money here. Money? Would the cops give us non-citizen money? Not on your life. You're saying it'd be better for us to try selling that bomb to the Black Foxes? In other words, you want us to extort money from those terrorists? We'd bag a million bucks. A million? I don't know. Sounds like a shitty thing to do. What do you care? Fine by me. I'll just make the money myself. Not so fast. What gives you the right to take the bomb? You walk out now, and I'll have the Space Guard all over you in five minutes. Listen. Jang, it's 40 to you. Then 30 to Park and me. Okay? "Okay"? - Forgetting someone? - All right, then. Thirty-five to you, 35 to me, 20, ten. What do you think? - "Ten"? - Why am I second to last, huh? What the hell happened to my 40 percent? You saying I don't matter or something? I want my five back. I'm worth way more than ten. Forty, 30, 20, and I'll take ten. Are you happy? - Greedy people go to hell, remember? - Fine by me. You sure you can really handle a job like this? I've got doubts about you. Hey, Park. You forgot about what I used to do, huh? I've dealt with assholes like them all the time. You just gotta tell them what you want. Not getting intimidated. Aren't you going to order? If not, then get out. I'll have a coke. Where is she? Where's the freaking kid? What… What is that? Is that… Is that a giraffe? This kid is drawing all over my room without asking me. Hey! Damn, the microphone's broken. What do we do? Use your headset and jack up the pitch. - What's this? - It's a smartphone. Uses a private satellite. Hard to trace. Very popular with criminals. They caught one of the Black Foxes, right? If he had one, won't the police know where to find us? I don't really know a ton about the technical side. Do you know a ton about the Black Foxes? Not too much. They weren't really around in my day. You don't know anything, huh? There we go. Huh? Should I call? - Hmm. - All right, then. Hello? Do you own this object, Dr. Kang? How much do you want? How much? How much… Fuck! - How much? - Let me think. A million? Two million? - What do you think? - A million. Or wait! - Two million. - Wait. Hold on. - No… - Two million is too high. - 1.5. - One and a half million. If you really insist, we'll give you a discount. Two million. In cash. Let's meet immediately. - I'll pay you once I see it. - Come on… By exit two of the Jenice Telescope Station. Zone G, at 13:00! - Not there. No! - Come on… At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost, in front of gate two at 14:00. Just a minute! What should I tell him? I'm worried about an explosion. Should I take precautions? It won't explode without an order. If this is a prank call, you will die. Don't be late. We won't wait. I'm rich! Yihee! - I'm rich… - Yeah! - Yes, a drink. Drink it up! - Woo-hoo! You deserve it after that, huh! - I knew you'd pull it off. - Yes, that's right! At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost, in front of gate two at 14:00. Bring me Dorothy. The fate of the human race is in danger. Be quiet and stay still. - Hey, are you listening to me? - But I'm already still. Is that a giraffe? You could use some drawing lessons, you know. It's a dinosaur, dummy. Hey, I'll show you a dinosaur. Take a good look at that, right there. What do you think about this? That's how a dinosaur is supposed to look, huh? This one's a dinosaur, too. Look up there. It's the same one. - That's... - Look at these other ones I drew. Well, would you look at that. I think I know who this is supposed to be. But don't you think my eyes are much bigger? Okay, I'll make the eyes a little bigger. Yes, that's right. Good. Show me. The nose, too. Look. - The nose? - Yes, bigger. A lot bigger. You're just doing this to torture us, aren't you? Do me a favor. If you're about to explode, let us know, please. I want a chance to get out of here, okay? All right, time for you to put this thing on. Does that mean we're going home soon, Uncle Tiger? Go time. Are we ready? We have five minutes! I've gotta warm up the engine or it might die. Well, I'm gonna die if we're late! Come here. Bubs, you, too. Two million! Think about two million, huh? Okay, let's huddle up. One, two, three! We got this. Opening docking port. Ah, we don't have time for this. Who is it? Didn't you lock the door? "P-O-L-I-C…" - Everyone act normal. - "Police"? Let's move! Wait, wait, wait. - Stop it! - Hide her over here. Hurry up! I'm forcing the door! Why didn't you open up? No respect for the UTS Police? This door, you know. It's a little funny sometimes. What's wrong with it this time? You really went wild on the illegal modifications to your ship. Our captain likes to fly it as fast as possible. Such an ugly ship is an insult to UTS citizens. We'll be careful from now on, officer. What the hell? Isn't this military equipment? Where did you get it? Oh, that old thing. We picked him up for cheap at the recycling depot. He's a good kid. Stay down. Why grow plants on a spaceship? Um, excuse me, sir. We're in a bit of a rush. What can we do for you? That's what I want to know. You're the one who called the police. Number 14. Miscellaneous crimes. Sir, let me explain. We just called to ask a question, you know. Two minutes left! Just two minutes! This is crazy. Who were you looking at? Huh? Hey, what the hell are you doing? That's my money. You can't take that! What are you doing? We never agreed to use my money. - Stop it! Stop it! - You son of a bitch! Wait, wait, wait. Sir, hold on. We have a very important meeting. Here, take this. Sir, please. Wait. Let me just explain... We got you on video. I'm surprised you showed up, officer. You cops never seem to respond to calls made by non-citizens. - Hey, Bubs. - Yeah? - Did you record him accepting the money? - Huh? Oh, yeah. Of course! I'm always recording! Nothing escapes me. The lights are off on your ship, so I bet your shift is over. Collecting bribes after hours? We could report that, couldn't we? Crazy bitch! I didn't ask for bribes. You didn't tell us which department you're from. - Hey, isn't that an illegal firearm? - Ah, that prick. Thought you got deported to Earth if they catch you with an illegal firearm. Well, I think that's right. You're pretty brave to carry it in the open like that. If you were smart, you'd keep it disassembled. Just another asshole on a power trip letting himself get carried away. Think you're better than a few fine non-citizens like us? What gives you the right to hit me on the head? Matter of fact, what gives you the right to do anything? - Listen to me. - Okay, I'm all metal. If you were really serious about getting away with this, you'd have to kill all of us and destroy the evidence. Think you can handle that? But there's always the option of getting the hell out of here. - You're going to pay for this! - Okay now! Fuck off! Captain! He's gone! Okay, he's gone. Hey, Park, get ready! The bag. Okay. The bag's ready! Let's go. Hey, Park, hurry. Come on! Told you this would be better for the swap. Goddamn! Sometimes I even impress myself. - Good job to me, huh? - Hey, Tae-ho. I was wondering something. What… What's gonna happen to our kid? - "Our kid?" - Well, yeah. She's not ours, and she's not even a kid. Who gives a shit if they blow her up or throw her in the garbage or whatever? - I mean, still… - TAE-HO: Listen to me. We're here to make money, remember? Pull yourself together, okay? Oh, shit. It must be getting stuffy in there. Hang on a bit longer, okay? Hey, asshole. I told you, gate two! Do you want your pet or not? Are you new at this? No bullets? And you came alone. Do you trust me, or underestimate me? Follow me, asshole! I got eyes on Dr. Kang. No ID on the other male. Take them all out as soon as you see Dorothy. Okay, guys, get ready! Just speak in Korean, Kang Hyeo-nu. Don't try any tricks. - First, give me the girl. - Money first. Money first! Make sure to retrieve Dorothy's body. Prepare to engage. Is this the correct amount? You see what I see? Nice. What the hell is this? She's not in here. You bastards. Who the hell are you anyway, huh? Huh? Where did she go? Dorothy's gone. I lost it. I lost it. You need to find her right now! If anyone recognizes her, we're done! Kot-nim! Kot-nim! - Goddamn. - Who is this kid? It is nearly indistinguishable from a real human child, but is actually a dangerous weapon that could cause mass destruction. It is equipped with a micro-explosive… Stay calm, everyone! It won't go off. Trust me, it won't! No… Eyes on the DJ booth. - What's happening? - What the… Target locked. All units engage. Out of the way! Kot-nim, go! Kot-nim! Kot-nim! Kot-nim! Where has Hyeo-nu gone? Oh, my God! Kang Hyeo-nu! Come back here! Now! Holy shit. Fire, number one. Take it down. Camilla, no organic matter detected. They're gone. How did you let that kid out of your sight? Hey, Park, why do you always have to do things so half-assed, huh? Why did you return the money? We could have just taken it and got away! You think you're smart? It was your idea to make the swap in a packed club. Shit! I knew this wouldn't work out. You always say that after something doesn't work out! It would have if I'd come with you. - Then why the hell didn't you? - Can't handle the truth? Both of you shut up for a second. The smartphone? We can track... This thing almost got us caught. The Space Guards were listening to everything. I kept the number and the line code, so we can use our own signal. Radio messages can't travel too far, but we'll keep trying. First, let's get the fuck out of here. The engine's dead. It means we're stuck here. Oh, what are we gonna do? This is so... God, it's just… Two million bucks. We're so screwed! Uncle Tae-ho, did you lose a lot of money? Hey, I'm not done with this one yet. What was your name again? Kot-nim is my name. - "Kot-nim"? - Aren't you Dorothy? But my real name is just Kot-nim. Kot-nim. That's pretty. Kot-nim? Doesn't roll off the tongue. It's better than Bubs. Don't say her name. - Kot-nim, what's wrong? - I think Uncle Tae-ho is scared of me. Hmm? No, that's not true. Come here. Oh, my God. Do we think Kot-nim is something to be afraid of? Hey, put down the fucking bomb, man. I think Uncle Tiger is the scariest person here. Better watch out! - Let's go scare Tae-ho! Scaredy-cat! - Hey, come on! - What's the matter? - Enough! Seriously - There he goes. Let's go get him. - I'm not joking. - Stay away from me! - Run, run, run! - Let's go get him! Come on! - Don't come near me! He's so scared. Look at him. Another miracle brought to you by UTS's latest nanobot technology. The tree of life, the Super Plant, takes its roots in a whole new planet. Welcome to the second space revolution. Mars. A happiness you never knew. Krypton waves have the ability to defuse nanobots and are only emitted during the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. But all of that is irrelevant to our presentation. Exactly. Totally irrelevant. The Black Foxes have a hydrogen bomb. Many UTS citizens are worried about that. The reach of Krypton waves is 5,000km. There's no danger of exposure to Mars. I would like to add a few words to the voiceover. The video is not a matter of urgency at the moment. Before Tree of Life, I would like you to say this is a species genetically modified to survive in Mars soil, that it can only grow on that planet. I just thought that... We have to make it stunningly clear… …that there is no hope left on Earth. I'm very sorry, Mr. Sullivan. Prove it. I need empirical evidence. Physically prove your crushing regret.

Why is my money always the emergency fund? I bought that battery last time, remember? We also need a welding rod. - They closed my tab long ago. - Whatever. I just think it's ridiculous. Three grown adults, and not a dollar between you. After this, we'll be dirt broke. What did I even save for? I'm sorry to bother you, Tae-ho. - Can you do me a favor? - Can't. But I haven't said what it is yet. Whatever it is, you can tell me, but it won't change anything. Can I borrow your scissors, please? No. - You can do me a favor. - Good idea! Whatever it is, let's go! High five! Don't do anything. I want no giggling, chatting, or drawing. None of that. Scissors, huh? - Careful now. - Yeah, I'll be careful. I meant with the tomatoes. Hey, I told you to wait on the ship! As soon as I found these, Pierre, I thought of you and came straight here. Thanks again for everything. - Damn, is that a real tomato? - I've never tasted one myself. Damn, that's good! - One dollar for each of them. - One dollar! Enjoy! Thank you! - Thank you very much! - Two red tomatoes. - Two? That's two dollars. - Two tomatoes for you. - Hey, I said red! - Your turn. Yay, we're gonna be a huge success! Hey, one at a time. No cutting in line. Thanks! Bye! It tastes so bad. Twenty-two, 23… Okay! Got it all over your face. Much better. What are you laughing at? There. I got us a welding rod! Now, Tiger Park, there's a story. Hold still. Once, he was a leader of a drug cartel. Used the money he made selling drugs to help poor kids. He had more money than he could count. He had to weigh the cash with a scale. At one point, he even had a tiger as a pet! As for Captain Jang, she's smart but has such a temper. So be careful not to get on, okay? And you know, she has the most foul mouth… Hey, I'm telling you important stuff! Why is the ship called Victory? Captain Jang was looking for ideas, and I came up with it. I used to think that winning was always a good thing. What about you, lady? What did you used to do? "Lady"? Huh… My goodness! I mean, that's… You just made my day. I'm planning to get skin grafting done, actually. If I alter my bone structures, too, it'll cost about 20,000. This is all illegal, of course. It's just I can't go through with it because I'm afraid people will laugh at me. But that's just an excuse. I can't afford it, even if I wanted to. You wanna know what I used to do? Air-to-air combat, infiltrating behind enemy lines, assassinations and… Wait. You're not actually a... Not what? Oh, now I'm really jealous. Why didn't you just come out and tell me? Aren't we girl friends? You can trust me. Do you think Uncle Tae-ho has always been this scary? He's not scary, dear. He's just poor, desperate, and mean. Kim Tae-ho… Sometimes, I feel bad for him. Illegal aliens on board. Permission to engage. Tae-ho was a child soldier. In his short life, he had already seen terrible things. One day, he saw something he never had before. A human baby. He told us it looked like an angel to him. Illegal Status. Case number 349547. Female, seven months. According to the rules, he should have sent her back to Earth immediately. But he had power back then, and chose not to. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie! Hold on a sec. Let me just… Make sure she naps at two. If she won't drink her formula, give her warm water. As time went on, he grew attached to her. So just like that, he became a dad. He was only 20 years old. Make sure not to go too far. You hear me? Su-ni! Su-ni? Su-ni! Surgery could bring her hearing back, but she will have to work on her pronunciation for the rest of her life. It appears that an extremely loud noise damaged her auditory nerves. It's all my fault. I would do anything for you. I swear that I'll be the best dad in the world, all right? No matter what happens, I'll always be there for you. After that, Tae-ho couldn't hurt anyone. SU-NI, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I THINK OF YOU WHEN I'M EATING Su-ni, Daddy wrote a song for you. I could sing it for you now, if you want. Would you like that? Okay, here I go. ♪ Su-ni ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ Su-ni, you're my everything ♪ ♪ When I'm eating food ♪ ♪ When I tie my shoes ♪ ♪ Always think of you ♪ ♪ My sweet girl ♪ You can't dismiss me without a trial. What have I done? Let go! You won't get away with this! You hear me? He got kicked out of the Space Guards because he wouldn't kill for them. He lost everything he had. He fell from the top of the food chain and hit rock bottom overnight. Daddy, look! It's just a piece of junk. Actually, it looks like a shooting star. If you make a wish, it will come true. After wandering around for a year without a home, Tae-ho lost himself. Sorry to rob you so blindly. You mad? It's getting hot in here! No, no, no! You have to pay! Su-ni, we're gonna have a feast tonight! Let's get out of here, okay? - Su-ni, did you hear me? - Impact alert. - Su-ni! - Space debris collision. Su-ni! MR-13, block 27. Sealing off all connected passages. Hmm, that trajectory doesn't look so great. I'm going to ask nine crafts to be assigned to your search mission, and we will scan the orbit using her DNA info. This is provided for free. The blinker slows down as the body grows further. Considering her weight, the location of disappearance, and the direction of the trajectory, I project about three years for her to completely vacate the orbit. "Vacate the orbit"? After three years, she'll be gone forever. Zero chance of recovery. Don't worry. We have a 100 percent recovery rate for searches if found within the first four days. The cost will be 194,000… Our services are cash only for non-citizens, inmates, and customers with criminal records. And, as you know, non-citizens are always cash only. If you get the process started, I... - Next. Number 298. - I could pay later! - Please! - You are done! A-76301. Even now, he is still looking for Su-ni. She's probably still out there waiting for her dad. Somewhere in the dark universe. Hey, Park. Are you using the torque wrench right now? Where is that guy? Park! Who told you you could use my po… Hmm, it's still missing something. Hello there, sir. - Who is this? - A friend of mine. - We're busy right now. Get lost. - Can we do something else? Fine. Just one more touch. What now? Are there any adults? "Adults"? Do I look like some baby to you? Oh, I meant human adults. It's ringing! Listen! Listen, it's ringing! Tae-ho! Hurry! Hurry! Come quick! Should I answer it? Come on! Hurry! Stop! We're from the Sector D Superior Court. We have orders to... Hello? F Building, ground floor. - Who is that? - Meet me there in 30 minutes. Hey! No, no, no… Block 27, MR-13, in… two hours, okay? I'm waiting till you show up. - All good? - Yes! We're back on! From now on, this property will belong to the bank. I'm very sorry for this situation. Go check the engine first. We have to leave in 30 minutes. Where did Captain Jang go? I haven't seen her in a while. - Hope she's not drinking again. - I don't wanna send Kot-nim back. Who knows what those Black Fox bastards are planning to do with her? Do you know why I'm still alive? Cause Su-ni's still out there. But very soon, she'll leave the orbit. If that happens, I'll never be able to find her. I need that money right now. We could all use that money. Now. I feel bad, too, you know. But think of all debt we have. We could pay it all back. And Bubs, I mean, he… - Kot-nim! - She's not there? - Kot-nim! - No, not inside. - Kot-nim! - Kot-nim! - Kot-nim! - Kot-nim! - Kot… - JANG: Kot-nim! - Where did she go? Kot-nim! - Kot-nim! Kot-nim! Kot-nim! Uncle Tiger! - Uncle Tiger! - Kot-nim! Park, where are you? Corridor 17! Kot-nim! Why does it feel like I'm the only one who does any work around here? Who are you? Get behind me. Go. Close your eyes. You punks wanna dance? No! I won't let you take Dorothy. You can open your eyes now. Look. - Huh? - Karum! Thank you for coming back. I know you're a busy man. But I'm the kind of person that cares about not being misunderstood. There's also something I wanted to show you. UTS is draining Earth's economy. Did you know you can tell a person's moral disposition by his or her DNA? The first thing we see is character. At UTS, we select only the most upstanding citizens to bring to space. Special Force Squad are the exception. But these people are wealthy is coincidence. I don't care about money. When you are as old as I am, money is hardly of consequence. UTS continues to suck out money and valuable human resources from Earth while dumping radioactive space debris back on the planet. You, James Sullivan, you are accelerating its death! I see you have a wife and a son. A family man. I lost my family. A war broke out the year I was born. My father died in battle, and my mother had to beg on streets to provide for me and my four siblings. Genocide swept through our village. Every day, I saw dead bodies falling. When I was six years old, my family were killed. Burned alive before my eyes. I saw my mother screaming as her chin melted away. And in that moment, I made a promise to myself. I vowed that I would make the world a better place. - I have to poop. - Oh! Sorry again for beating you up. What the hell's going on here? I should be asking you that question. - What are you planning to do with Dorothy? - Let's just call it even. Go away! Before Dorothy exits that door. Why don't we pretend this didn't happen? - Don't you give us orders! - It's a suggestion, not an order. Bubs, cut off the guy's tongue if he keeps interrupting. See? Now that is an order. Looks like we're all trying to hide something here. Why don't we talk this out, hmm? I'll get us started. Robots don't poop, as far as I know. Kot-nim is a human. I knew it. That must be why I thought she was so damn adorable. Kang Kot-nim. She's the daughter of a nanorobotic scientist named Kang Hyeo-nu. There. Your turn. Does Dr. Kang still have the money? - Money? What money? - What is she talking about? Damn, they're worse at this than I thought. Turn off the lights. Lock the door. Black Foxes. Our deal isn't over yet. I don't wanna hurt you guys. So please tell me. What the hell is going on here? Little Black Fox, hunted and caught in a trap trying to escape with Dorothy. Shoot him. You will answer my question. I will make you a UTS citizen, effective immediately. Oh, this man is going to die, anyway. - You are sick. - You see, you talk about protecting the Earth, but actually you want nothing more than to be here in Eden. And you resent the fact that you weren't one of the chosen. Why wouldn't you? You can have everything here. Clean air. Nice house. Friendly neighbors. Are you gonna let your family suffer in that hellhole for the rest of their lives? Look. Look! You see what you just did? No… This is your true nature. Greed and hatred are engraved in your DNA. Did you really believe you deserved a place in Eden? Answer me! You're a vile pollutant. You'll crawl into my paradise and infect it with your filth. The world will never be a better place while it's infested with scum like you. My job is to cleanse the infection. The future of humanity depends on it. The abductors and space sweepers, bring them to me. The Black Foxes are not terrorists. We were an environmental organization until the Space Guards came down on us. We're the only survivors. Enough with the backstory. We've been following this Mars program since the beginning. Don't you think it's strange? If Mars with its harsh environment can be turned into green land, then why couldn't Earth be? Dorothy isn't an ordinary child. She was born with a congenital illness which destroys her nerves. Nobody had a cure. There was no hope. As a last resort, Dr. Kang injected nanobots into her body. It was like a miracle. The nanobots repaired the nerves, and Dorothy was able to walk again. But the real miracle would come later. The nanobots and Dorothy were programmed to send signals to each other. But the nanobots went further and started talking to bots outside her body, too. Nobody knows how it's possible. Not even Dr. Kang can explain it. She can make flowers blossom on a dead tree. Here was a possibility to bring life back to Earth. But Sullivan took Dorothy to use her in his Mars development project. He hadn't been getting anywhere before, but now he's got this new power. That's how he turned Mars into a tropical island. One genetically modified plant changed Mars. But nothing can save Earth? It's all bullshit. And the mass media just repeats Sullivan's lies. And Kot-nim, what will happen to her? What do you think Sullivan's gonna do with her? Well, as Mars became the only planet where terraforming was possible, the miracle needed to disappear. They wiped away everything. Lab results, data, the scientists who worked on the project. Kot-nim got out before they could kill her. They can't kill Dorothy. Dorothy gets protection from the nanobots. The only way to kill a nanobot is to heat it over 200 million degrees… A hydrogen bomb. There's a bomb inside the Factory's anti-gravity engine. A real one. Dorothy will be taken there and blown into subatomic particles. The Factory will then crash into the Earth, causing massive fractures across the planet's crusts, as well as tsunamis and nuclear fallouts. More than three billion people will die. Sullivan is not a savior of humanity. He wants to destroy everything on Earth! - Is that a gunshot? - Oh, what's going on? Why are you doing this to us? Hurry up already. We can go through the mechanical room in the back. MR-13, block 27. I'm meeting Kang Hyeo-nu back there. I'll see you there. We're gonna use the back door! Com on, Bubs. - You're with us. - What about Kot-nim? I'll protect her. Just stay calm, and we'll walk right outta here. Go! - You! Hold it... - I'm not afraid of you! All done. What's wrong? - Hop on. - Huh? Come on, hurry up already! Are you sure you want to go in there? I just took a dump. It's a pretty bad one. Bless you. Thank you, Uncle Tae-ho. Hey, Kot-nim, are you doing okay? Yeah, I'm okay. What about you, Uncle Tae-ho? Are you okay? I'm okay. I got a 20 on Dorothy. Is it too late to change my answer? Hallway G-34. Suspect's vessel is KOR SH 7901, Victory. We'll be okay, Captain Jang. Get out of here while you still can. You hear me, Captain Jang? Come on! What the fuck is going on? You bastards! I got Dorothy. Bridge D4. Camilla is at bridge D6. Chasing. Here we go, Kot-nim! Hold tight! No! No more crazy jumps! You better get inside, Kim Tae-ho! Hold on! I'll get the harpoon! Kot-nim! - No! - Kot-nim! Move over! Let me fly. We're in. Let's go! Steady. Come on. Entering Lagrangian Point Space Debris Field. No. - Oh, just what we need. - Alter course immediately. Steering malfunction. Steering malfunction. Everything will be okay. Keep your eyes closed. Don't open them. Count to 100 for me. Oxygen leak in the main circuit! The vent shaft is breached, too! Our engine's about to blow! Thirty-two, 33… Warning. Warning. Nanobot infestation detected. Evacuate ship. It's over. …78, 79… …95, 96… …99, 100. Kot-nim! Kot-nim! What… what do we do? Her heart stopped beating. - Someone get the defibrillator. - Hold on. I'll get it. Hey, everyone. Calm down, okay? You need to stay calm! Calm down, please. - Why is this so disorganized? - Gently. - Be gentle. Don't break her ribs! - One, two, three, four. Five. Kot-nim! Six. Kot-nim! Seven. Kot-nim! Eight… Did she just… Who farted? You. You little fart machine. She's a robot, after all. A fart robot! Hey, be honest. You pooped a little, too. - I do need to use the bathroom. - We know. Departing Lagrangian Point. All systems normal. The suspects are currently aboard the spaceship Victory, plate number KOR 7901SH. They have been posing as Korean space sweepers but are actually members of the infamous Black Fox terrorist organization. Famous. They were responsible for the nightclub massacre in the 32nd Commercial District, as well as the shooting on the Factory, the waste management satellite. They are currently in possession of Dorothy and are on the run from authorities. They're all Korean. Jang Hyun-sook. Adopted through the UTS Genius Program and trained as an engineer. As a student, she developed 4D AR lenses in addition to lightweight laser blasters and EMP mines. At age 19, she deserted the colony to form a pirate organization after becoming immersed in anti-UTS ideology. She attempted and failed to assassinate UTS CEO James Sullivan, during which attempt all of her crew members died. She's suspected to be living under a false identity after undergoing eye replacement surgery. Park Kyung-soo. Until four years ago, he led a sizable drug cartel on Earth, fled the planet to avoid capture, and is now illegally residing in the orbit. No one else knows, but he was sentenced to death before fleeing, and if he ever returns to Earth, he will be promptly executed. Kim Tae-ho. The first-ever UTS Genius. The only adoptee you carried into UTS in your arms. Also the inaugural commander of the Space Guard. At age 17, he reset the records for flight speed missions completed… What a sick twist of fate. We're two hours late for the handoff. He'll be there. Kang Hyeo-nu has nowhere else to go. Kot-nim is with us. We just need to get down to Earth's airspace, then it's game over. Sullivan can't touch us there. Kang Hyeo-nu, the Black Foxes, Kot-nim, Bubs, you, and Park. - Once we're all together, we'll head down. - No way. I don't like waiting that long. Those Space Guard assholes could show up anytime. Let's just head down to Earth right now. - We need to keep Kot-nim safe. - What the heck are you talking about? We can't go anywhere without the money. No more stupid ideas, okay? I gotta work in here. Go hang out with Captain Jang. Uncle Tae-ho, you wanna know something? There's no up or down in space. Nothing out here is better or worse than anything else. That's because everything out here has its special place. Who told you that? That's what Dad always says. Hey, Kang Kot-nim, how come you haven't drawn me yet? You were the first person I drew, Uncle Tae-ho. I didn't show you because I was scared of you. Why don't we put this up somewhere? Anyway, if you wanna draw, just do it over there, please. Make sure your stuff doesn't get all over. - Uncle Tae-ho, your shoes. - What about them? They broke. I know that Su-ni was your daughter. Why don't we go and see her together one day? I don't know where she is, but we can still see her. Has anyone seen Kot-nim? Anyone? Where is she hiding now, that little rascal? Park's looking for you, I think. - That's too cold! - Sorry. Uh, let's see. How about now? It's warm. Oh? Great. All right. Why don't we try washing your hair? Kot-nim, we wanna make sure you're nice and clean for your dad. Close your eyes. You should put a bucket underneath! Come on, Park, you're doing it wrong. Why don't you mind your own business before I get pissed off, huh? Hey, let me see. I'll show you. What are you doing? She's not a newborn baby. I'm doing fine, thank you very much. - Let me show you. - Why are you bothering us? - What can you show me? - Come on! - You'll get water up her nose. - Like hell I will. Give me back the hose. See? That is what you wanted? - Leave us alone. - Kot-nim, get out of here. - Aight! - This is ridiculous. Hey! Just quit it! Stop! Wait! Hey! My eyes! Hey! Stand still. Hey! What are you guys doing? Get out. - This is all your fault. - I was just gonna show you. - Shut up and get out. - You ever raised a kid? What experience do you have? Oh, I have plenty. Kot-nim, here's some soap. Close your eyes. Do those idiots think water is cheap or something? Is Uncle Tae-ho angry again? Is he mad because of Su-ni? I don't know. There it is! Arriving at MR-13 in five minutes. Switching to manual pilot. Hello? - Hello? - Karum? Can you hear me? Anyone hear me? We can hear you! We can hear you! - Where is Dr. Kang? - I just picked him up. I am with him now. He was already there when I came. Yeah! - Hurry up. - Okay. We're going in now. Karum, your GPS is off, right? - Yeah, it's off. - Can you double-check? You won't find me on your radar. I flew in here with my eyes alone. Let's be careful. No trouble this time. Where are we going? We're going to meet your dad. No way! He's there? Is he really? Okay, okay, we see Victory. We see Victory now. Do you see us? Yes, I see you now. I see you. - Hey, Dad! - Kot-nim! - Daddy! - Kot-nim! I missed you. I'm so sorry, baby. Daddy's so sorry. Kot-nim, you must be starved. No, I'm full. Captain Jang gave me some hot sauce and made dinner really yummy. Bubs put makeup on me, but all of it is gone now. Uncle Tiger fixed the hole of my sock and washed my hair for me. And Uncle Tae-ho and I made $23 from selling our tomatoes. Can you believe that? Thanks to all of you. Thank you so much. Good job. - We did it. - I'm so happy she is with good people. She is so beautiful. Look at her. Look at her. Tae-ho, my man. We did it. Look at this. We did it! I need to talk to you. Where is it? It's in the ship. You sure there's two million in there? Don't worry, you'll get your money. Okay, but I have to make sure it's all there. You understand? That's enough about the money. We'll deal with that later. I can't show you right now. Not in front of the kid. Just go bring the bag! That's your job. Since when am I in charge of the money? Just go get the money. What's so hard about that? - Guys, take this outside. - Chill out. It'll be fine. EMP explosives. All systems shutting down, excluding crew life support. Reboot in progress. Estimated time, three minutes. Get the engine running. Bubs! Take Dorothy and the Victory crew alive. Eliminate everyone else. Karum! Daddy! Daddy! - Get away! - Daddy! Daddy! Kot-nim! - Kot-nim! - Kot-nim! Daddy, help me! No, please! How nice to see you all again. Park, Bubs, and Tae-ho, I'm… I'm sorry. Captain Jang! She is the only one that ever got close enough to aim a gun in my face. It's been your lifelong dream to kill me, hasn't it? Come on. Come on, give it to me. Still hanging on to the dream, I see. No! Never thought I would see the great Commander Kim Tae-ho living in such squalor. Not that it doesn't suit you. It does. Really. It was right here, wasn't it? Three years ago. The place where you lost your daughter. Ah… I'm gonna make Dorothy disappear with the Factory. "Giant mass of space junk falls to Earth!" "Earth destroyed by catastrophic impact!" "‘Earth beyond saving!" Everyone will think it was the Black Foxes anyway. Who cares if a billion lives are lost? Genetic defects. Dr. Kang was unable to keep his side of the bargain, but I will. I'm prepared to pay double. Four million. The money's yours. Are you gonna let your daughter drift in space forever? Time's running out, Tae-ho. Come on. Come on. Take the money and find Su-ni. The price of Dorothy's life. You knew, and you still took it. I want this engraved in your heart forever. Now do you see who you really are? You are no good man. You will never be a better person. You just lost your chance to ever become one. Smile. Turn those frowns upside down! You just won the lottery! The charges have all been dropped as of this moment. Victory. System reboot complete. Don't kill them just yet. I want them to see the Factory fall. The death of their planet. Then you can kill them. My dear UTS citizens. Today, we take another step forward together towards a new space age. Today, I present to you the home, the answer to our quest for eternal happiness and prosperity. Mars. Beautiful. My cut's ten, like we agreed. What, you don't want it anymore? That money is filthy. Forget it, then. Jang, Bubs, you guys split his share. How can you even think about touching that money? Got another way to pay this month's interest? What about fuel, oxygen, and water? The insurance payments and the taxes, huh? The whole ship belongs to the bank. But I forgot. You don't need money. Let's face it, we'll never be free. No matter how hard we work, there's always more debt, am I right? I'm not giving up on her. Kot-nim is still at the Factory. It's far, so the engine will need to warm up. Park, listen. I'll keep everything running. One of you can fly. If we go there, we die. You understand that? I don't care about that. I'm willing to die. Kim Tae-ho, there's things you have to do. Park and I will take care of this mission, so go. Go and find your daughter. Camilla has completed setting up hydrogen bomb timer. Location. Anti-gravity sphere. All gunners, keep your sights steady on Victory. Commence firing as the Factory hits the Earth. I guess you've been through a lot since the last time I saw you. Just take the money. 400,000? Wait right here, sir! We can get a search craft deployed in five minutes. For that money, we can find your loved one in 24 hours! Congratulations. You finally did it. WRITING KOREAN KIM SU-NI SU-NI, DADDY LOVES YOU THE BEST I THINK OF YOU WHEN I EAT, PUT ON SHOES… DADDY. SU-NI LOVES YOU THE BEST. I LOVE YOU WHEN I EAT, PUT ON SHOES, DO LAUNDRY. I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU. You bastard! You think you can cheat me, huh Fuck you! Hey, hey, guys, guys. Calm down. It's just a game, okay? She can't talk, but she can fight, huh? Hey, Daddy. Can you go play outside? Look, I made this for you. Go buy a snack, okay? I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU For years, all they wanna talk about is money. Now we're throwing it out? I think I'm crazy or something. Hey, you're back! - What? Why would you... - I guess I'm crazy now. Hey, Park, fill up the tank. Tae-ho? I just remembered a promise I made. - What promise was that? - What are you doing in my seat? Get out! It's been a long time, Captain. Oh, boy. We're actually doing this. Rear hatch gravity level, 1.2 Gs. Magnetic compensation, 0.5 Gs. Hit it. Camilla, Victory is escaping. They are intercepting our missile. There's too many of them. Laser gun. Rear hatch. Close the valve now! Bubs, I need some help here. We're almost done, Bubs. Everyone hang in there. Come on. Oh, no! My harpoon! Good work, Bubs. Clear. They keep coming. Rebooting. Rebooting. Park, I need one last favor. I want everything out of those engines, okay? You can count on me. Uh, what's he doing? Kim Tae-ho, you better not kill us! Park, come on. I'm almost there! Just one more. It's done! Push it, Park! They are headed to the anti-gravity sphere. Our Special Forces Squad have failed to… Kim Tae-ho, you have a plan to get us out of this? I don't think he does. Don't think. Just step on it! Is that the bomb? If that thing goes off, we're all dead meat. Captain Jang? - Are you all right? - Kot-nim! Kot-nim! There you are! Uncle Tiger, can you tell me where my daddy is? Why don't we just get you out of here, okay? - "Krypton." - Where is she? Thank God we found her. Kot-nim, come on. Let's go. There's no use. It's hopeless. When the bomb goes off, it'll send out Krypton waves within a radius of 5,000km. Every nanobot within that distance will shut down. - What are you talking about? - Kot-nim, let's go. Come on! I'm saying that even if she survives, the disease will kill her. We won't be able to save her, no matter what. What are you talking about? We need to defuse the bomb. If it doesn't explode, she'll be fine, right? We can't stop it. They put the detonator inside the bomb. It will go off the second I hack in. No matter what, that bomb will explode. And the Factory will crash into Earth. We can't do anything about that. Captain Jang, why are you talking like this? We need to keep thinking! Think! If we got her far enough… If we can take Kot-nim far enough away from the explosion, would that be enough to save her? If she's out of range of the Krypton emission. - How far? - 5,132km. It's the only chance we have. Then that's what we do. Get her on the ship. - Kot-nim. - We don't have a lot of time. But I'll go as fast as I can. Uncle Tae-ho! Listen to me. Run away as fast as you can. You'll see the ship. - Just wait for me inside. - What's going to happen to you? Stay in the ship, and I'll bring everyone back with me, yeah? Touch her, and I'll kill you, you ugly bitch. Kot-nim! You kids should stay out of this. I'm the only one here who can handle her. Park, what are you... Hey, Park! You wanna steal the girl, then I'll take something from you. - You've asked for one. Still warm. - It is warm. That's a real hand! - Thank you. Thank you, Tiger Park. - SNICKERS: Hey, be careful, everyone. Take your time. Fuck that! Go as fast as possible! Everyone, shut up! You're confusing him. Detecting 98 incoming attack drones… Captain Jang, Pierre will come if you called him! He helped us last time! Emergency channel. Hey, Park, is the emergency radio on? Emergency channel! Emergency channel! KOR SH 7901, Victory. Oh, it's already on. Current location, inside the anti-gravity sphere in the Factory. - You reading me? - We heard everything! We need to go help Captain Jang! You think I'm calling for myself? You have no idea what's going on, do you? Listen to me carefully. The Factory is about to explode and crush into Earth. Our only true home, where all our families and friends live. It won't just be a small accident. It will destroy us all. If you're a space sweeper in the Factory, get out now if you fear death. The rest of you, why not come fight? What the hell else do you have to live for? 5,000km. Tae-ho, we gotta move! Victory, I know you've got it in you. Please. I don't know if the engines can make it that far. Incoming attack drones. Incoming attack drones. Incoming attack drones. - Pierre? - Captain Jang! It's me! I'll do anything. I can give my life to it! My God, that young man is really obsessed. Save it for later, you two. Park, you ready? There's… There's just so many of them. Stop whining, Tiger Park! Let's go! Pierre, out of the way! All right. Space Sweepers, show me what you can do. Get it! Is that all you got? Damn! I almost lost it there. Shit! Ha ha! One is on their tail! Got you, bastard! Attack drones are battling… What? Right now? This just in. A shocking audio was just heard through the emergency channel of space sweepers. "Giant mass of space junk falls to Earth!" "Earth destroyed by catastrophic impact!" Everyone will think it was the Black Foxes anyway. Who cares if a billion lives are lost? It's genetic defects. Who cares if a billion lives are lost? Who cares if a billion lives are lost? Come on… Kot-nim, are you okay? - She didn't get hurt, right? - Don't worry. Our little fart machine is safe inside the container. Surprise! No! - Captain Jang! - Captain Jang! - Where are you hiding her? - That's not good. She's mine! Worthless space junk! Shit! It's too slow. Park! Divert the fuel to the emergency booster! The booster only lasts 20 seconds! That's all! That should be enough. Fuck! Bubs! You gotta release the booster from outside! Got you! Bubs! Where is she? Where is Dorothy? More than three billion people are expected to die on Earth if the Factory falls. Unfortunately, defusing is no longer an option. - All access to the factory… - What happened? …has been banned by UTS. A catastrophic end seems inevitable for Earth. Tae-ho, are you okay? Captain Jang, Park, and Bubs. Flying with you has been a great honor. You guys are the best team I ever had. And my best friends. You guys know I love you, right? Where is she? Give her to me! Kang Kot-nim… She was never here, you monster. The bomb is about to go off, so let's take it as far away as possible. What? And leave Kot-nim at the Factory? Captain Jang! It's me! No, we'll send her with Pierre right before we make our escape. Will you be okay without me? We have a job to do. I promise we'll be fine. So we act as bait so Kot-nim can get out alive? Sounds like a suicide mission. This is the only way. Take care, Kot-nim, dear. We have to get the bomb at least 5,000km away from here. It's the only way she'll survive. The only way Earth will survive. We actually did it. No. Why? This isn't possible. I did everything right. Wait. What? What? What happened? The bomb exploded in outer space! The Factory did not fall. Earth has survived. What is that? They're Lagrangian nanobots. The indestructibles. - Is Bubs okay? - We did it. He's fine. Well, at least his head is. It'll cost a fortune to get him repaired. And what was all that? "Flying with you was an honor"? "You're my best friends"? "You guys know that I love you"? Oof! Gotta say that was all pretty cringey, huh? People around the world are still reeling from the shocking revelations. We now know that the Super Plant Project, which was conceived originally as an effort to save the Earth… UTS just released a statement apologizing for its cover-up. It also promised to widen its efforts in rehabilitating the Earth and restoring harmony across the solar system. As for the brave space sweepers who averted what could have been a mega-disaster, UTS said it would provide immediate reparations for any damages or casualties suffered. Where's my money at, little piggy? - Do… Do I know you? - Recognize me? It's Bubs, who you ripped off. Porky, that idiot. Caught him in a casino gambling away your money. - Give me the money. - Yes, pay up! I was talking to you. Go get it, please. Right. It's a 99.99 percent DNA match. We won't know Su-ni's location, but Kot-nim will be able to communicate with the nanobots in her vicinity. Now, the nanobots we inserted into your cranial nerves will receive the data and interpret them through your sensory system. Now, we don't know what form the data will take or just exactly how the interpretation process works. But we do know that for that one moment, you and Su-ni will be connected. And Dorothy will be your medium. We're synced up. This is Su-ni at this exact moment. Dad, look. I'm done with it all. You're all done, huh? Come on, then. Show it to me. WRITING KOREAN Wow, you did a great job. Hey, Su-ni, can you give me a hug? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I took so long. I'm so happy you came back to me. See you later, Daddy. Kim Su-ni. Departed the orbit at 17:42 hours, September 3rd, 2092. You've been slacking. Keep it up, and I'll send you to boarding school. - Good idea. - Stop. Don't be ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. She needs to learn how to take some responsibility. You should see how these other moms handle their kids. They have tutors, extra-curricular and all. That's right. You want her to grow up thinking we don't care? I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything. Hey, Kot-nim! You want us to send you to boarding school? See? She doesn't want to. People tell me that I have a nice voice. I think I'm leaning towards this one. People often tell me I have a sexy voice. Which do you think? None of them. I like how you sound right now. Okay, just pick one 'cause I'm getting sick of the one I've got, hmm? We're one big family now. Sometimes, I go down to Earth to make trees. Captain Jang doesn't drink anymore. And Bubs is happy being herself. She says she wants to be a sophisticated lady. Uncle Tiger got rid of his tattoos so he wouldn't scare my friends. And Uncle Tae-ho bought ten pairs of new shoes. I think my dad is watching me from somewhere. And when he's happy, I'm happy. Rude. Hey, I'm trying to read here! What the heck are they doing on our turf? Hey! Start the engine. Maybe they found something good out there. Okay, let's make some money today, shall we? Darcy Paquet, Stefan Schwarz
