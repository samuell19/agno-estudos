He's accused of eight murders and 24 counts of sexual assault across three counties in Northern California. We'll bring you live up to the minute coverage. In sports news- - Good morning, Mavis, looking good today. Shit, Molly, what'd I tell you about staying up late, watching reruns of "Friends"? Great, I have five friends, two from work, two family members, and a guy from India I don't know. At least I have you guys. ♪ In New Orleans ♪ ♪ They call it the ♪ ♪ It's been the ruin of many a poor boy ♪ - Hey. - Come on. - Hey, excuse me, excuse me. - Yes, with Ellie. Can she do it? Yes, just a fill. - The line? - Unless there's time for a gel. - Come on. - Does she have time for a gel and dip? I have french tips on right now. Does Ellie have time for a gel and dip? Can I add a pedicure and then gel for my toes? - Miss, please, there's a line. Yes, 11:00 am it is. Yes, okay, thank you, you're so awesome. I'll have a skinny oat milk latte, and then make sure it's organic. It is organic? - Yes, ma'am. - How do you know it's organic, are you just saying that? - It's organic. - Uh, hi, could I get two black coffees and a blueberry muffin? Keep the change. Hey. - What, they always fuck up your order. - I know. - Jesus, have some balls and return this crap. Here, I'll do it- - No, no, no, no. It's not, it's fine. So what are you, like, 58 weeks? - Try 22, ass wipe. I'm literally gonna get so fat, I'm gonna be the elephant in the room. - You and Tommy pick out a name yet? - No, we can't agree on a name. - Still? Is it that big a deal, just pick one. - Yeah, you're right, it's just the rest of her life. No big deal. Sis, are you happy? I mean, really, like, I don't know. I just feel like ever since Dad passed, you just haven't really moved on. - Yeah, yeah, I'm happy. Uh, I'm as happy as I'm ever gonna be, so let's just leave it at that. - Okay. - What about you, what about the business loan? - I have a meeting tomorrow. Oh! - Well, a virtual meeting, Zoom. - Ugh, Zoom. - I know, right, it's like the millennial's response to the mullet, business on the top, party on the bottom. Hey, let's meet tomorrow after and we can celebrate. - Sweet. Shit, I should go, I gotta bring Collin his coffee. - Oh, God. See you tomorrow? - Yes. Cool. - Everyone who comes in here, I give my heart to, and that's why I see you, I see your situation. The best way to get over somebody is to get underneath somebody- Amy! There she is, Amy.

Can I see you in my office right freaking now, please? Thank you, all right, thanks for playing. And thank you for playing. We'll take this up later. Something to remember you by. I'm very disappointed in you, Amy. I mean, I thought that you were in a good position to be employee of the month, but you showing up four minutes late, that really doesn't help your chances. - Right, sorry, I have to ask. Are you watering this plant? I mean, come on, it needs water and love. - Amy, who cares about the plant? We are talking about your future here, now. All right, I mean, look at you, Amy. You got, what, five miserable pieces of fucking flare on. Did we not have the flair pin talk? Do you think that Jen would show up to work with five miserable pieces of fucking flair? - Are we talking about Jen from "Office Space"? I mean, duh, Jen wouldn't dare set foot in work if she didn't have at least 19 pieces of fucking flair on. Girl, you just, you got, you gotta step it up, okay? Is that my coffee? - Yes, it is. - Okay. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, hold your horses. Amy, this coffee is cold, okay? Cold coffee makes me sad. You know what makes me happy? , hmm?

And especially do not forget your ABC's, huh? - Why do I need the alphabet, Collin? - Amy, every great salesperson knows what ABC means, okay? Always be closing, got it, huh? You got it, all right. Good, good luck. - Wow. You missed your true calling. You should be a motivational speaker. - You know, if I had a dollar for every time I've heard that, ah, you see what I did there? A dollar? Yeah, I know, it was pretty good. What, can I have a few pieces of that? - Let me ask you a question. Does your dick touch your ass? - No. - Then you can't have any candy. - Okay, that'll be 46.50. How many bags do you want? - I don't need any bags. - Sorry, your card was declined. - Oh, I have another, I think. Yeah, here, here it is. - Okay. Come on. - I'm not getting any younger here. - Do you have another option? - I know what's going on here. - Ma'am, I'm just trying to ring people up with five items or less.

I think the stress is getting to you. - Yeah. - Take the day and relax, all right? - You can come back now. 95 mile an hour fast ball, two down. Hoff's on home plate, Sarkozy jumps- - Hey, baby mama. - Oh my goodness, hello. Ugh. - Yeah? How's she doing? Good, we're tired. Hmm, shopping? - No. - Yes. - Yes? - That was a yes no, right there. - It was, I only went to a couple stores. - Oh, a couple? - Yeah. - We gonna talk about what stores these were? - No, I would rather talk about your day. - Ah, I bet, okay, my day, huh? - Mm-hmm. - How was my day? - Yes. - Uh, my day, uh, ooh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I had a student projectile vomit on my shoes today. What was the best part of y'all's day? - Ooh, if everything goes as planned, I'm gonna get my bank loan tomorrow. - Yo, for real? - Yeah. - Ah, I see you, babe, way to go, good job. - Thank you, so 'tis that time. - Hmm. - I need baby names. - Baby names, for the baby? - Yeah, yeah, no, for the dog. What do you mean, yeah. - Yeah, I think we have Zoe. - Okay. - Kelly, which, which, which spinner fingers are you feeling right now? Zoe or Kelly? - You know, we have a few more months, it's fine. We'll, we'll figure it out. - Do you like those though, right? - Yeah, I like them. - They're great. - I like them, um- - Well, what was the worst part of your day? - Hmm, probably seeing Ames. I don't know, she's, she's definitely had a rough go of it since Dad died, but I don't know, just sister's intuition tells me that something else is going on. - Yeah, it takes time. You know, people, people heal on their own schedules. - Yeah, yeah, I know, you're right. - Yeah, she'll be back to her old self someday soon, babe. - Well, in the meantime, I guess we can binge watch some "90 Day Fiance." - Oh, yeah. - Or "Hoarders." - Mm, okay, that's cool, yeah. Which one do you want to watch? - "90 Day Fiance." - Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too, me too, me too. - Oh, did you get my sardines and whipped cream? - Oh, you were serious? - Don't judge me. - Oh, oh my God. Baby, where did that voice come from? - The baby. - It was the baby? Don't you put that on our baby. Don't you put that on our baby, mm-mm. - Sure, he cheats on you every weekend, but it makes sense.

Who devastated our city for 40 years- - Geez, you're really not living up to your name this morning, are you? I'm hoping for a new dawn, except I'm living in "Groundhog Day," story of my real life. ♪ I'm trying to be open, but ♪ - Good morning, Mavis. I put some CBD oil in your water this morning. I hope that's not too incestuous in the plant world. ♪ Before we're leaving here ♪ ♪ Before we're leaving here ♪ ♪ I know it ain't easy ♪ ♪ But there's something ♪ - Oh, God. - Okay, Mrs. Taylor. - It's Mary, you can call me Mary. - So Mrs. Taylor, have you given any thought to what you'd like to use as collateral for this loan? - I was thinking about our condo. - Oh, okay, the condo with no equity. I'm gonna guess that you don't know what equity is because you don't have any. Does that sound right? We're not in the risk business, Mrs. Taylor, so we're not gonna give you money that you can't pay back, okay? Okay? However, if maybe Mommy and Daddy could cosign this loan, we could do it. - Um, no, my mom left us when I was two and never looked back. - Wait, was it a pool boy? It could have been a pool boy. Pool boy? - No, no. She just, she just left. Look, I really need this loan so that I can start my music studio. - Oh my God, let me guess. You want to be the next "American Idol"? Yeah, yeah, I can see it. - Listen, my dad passed away and it was our dream to start this music studio together. Then his douche bag friend, Mr. Dalmer, told my dad on his deathbed that the mob was gonna kill him if he didn't pay his $300,000 gambling debt. - Do you know what that sounds like? That sounds like your problem. - Okay, so when he died, me and my sister went to try to collect the money and he said, "Go screw yourself," and we said we'd sue, he said, "Get in line," and that was just, it was four years ago. I just, I don't know, I don't understand how someone could do that. - I don't know, with a name like Dalmer, maybe you're just lucky he didn't eat your face off. - So I assume we have a deal? - Yes, it's a no, what is wrong with you? We're done here, we're done. Have a nice day, or don't, I don't care. We're done here, have a nice day, okay, okay, God. What is wrong with this lady? How come I have to start my mornings with idiots every fricking time? I need a latte. - Hey, hey, Doc, and your friend. I'm gonna save you some time. I'm just under a lot of stress right now. - Well, that's not good. I'm afraid to say that this is something a little more definitive. I'd like you to meet- - Hey, Doc, I'm sorry, I really hate to be rude, but I've got a boss that's looking for any excuse to fire me, so if we could just wrap this up. - We received, we received your test results from last week, and I'm sorry to tell you, Amy, you have a brain tumor, and unfortunately, it's inoperable. This is Dr. Krause, she's an oncologist and one of the leading in our field, and she can explain things a little further for you. - Amy, you have a glioblastoma. - A what? - You have a glioblastoma. It's a brain tumor, and not only that, it's one of the fastest growing brain tumors. - Okay, uh, okay, what's the treatment plan? Like, what do I, what? - There's no easy way to say this, Amy, but there is no treatment. - There's no chemo that it would respond to and it's gone too far for radiation. - Unfortunately, you only have, you only have days to live, maybe a week at most.

I'm gonna be there with you every step of the way, okay? I promise. Um, how would you like to spend your last few days? - Uh, I don't know. I thought about that on the way over. I was thinking maybe, maybe I need one of those, like, bucket lists, like, go on an African safari or something. - I think you need a shit load of money and a private jet to get you there with a few days to live. - Ugh, right, do you think the lady at the bank would lend me some money? No, you're broke, and so am I, apparently. Well, I know we could do a VIP tour at the Sacramento Zoo, I know a guy. - No, God, that's even more depressing.

Okay. - Okay, yeah, it was very serious stuff, and the director running the audition was this pretentious little prick that actually screamed at me. - Stop! - And was like, "You're wasting my time." And told me I should never sing again. - What a dick. - Yeah, it was, so obviously I run out of there and I'm bawling my eyes out. I run straight into Dad's arms and he just holds me for what feels like an eternity. - He had the best hugs. Yeah, yeah, he did. Uh, anyway, he, uh, he pulls me aside and he's like, "Amy, opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one." What? Yeah, yeah, it was hysterical. I was laughing so hard, even though I'm sure I had no idea what he was talking about. Okay, the next part is what makes Dad a legend. So he, um, he's like, "Okay, you stay here. I'm gonna go get parking validation or something, okay, like, wait in the car." But obviously I followed him and I see him onstage, walks up to the director- - Amy, you're killing me with this pace. I'm sorry, sorry, he's, like, walks up to the director and he just starts to lay it into this guy, right? He's just, like, really giving it to him. The guy just finally, once Dad's finished, he's like, "I'm not the director." And he points to the guy that is the director, who, for some reason, has a clarinet, and he walks over and he gets within inches of the real director's face, and he's like, "If you ever bully a child ever again, I will personally come down here and shove that clarinet so far up your ass, you'll be shitting show tunes for the rest of your pitiful life." Oh my God. I know. Holy shit, how have I never heard that story? - I don't know, but yeah, so then the director calls me the next day and he apologized, and I never told Dad I saw the whole thing. - Wow, he really was awesome. - Yeah. What about you, what's your best Dad story? - Hmm. Do you remember when Don Henbuddy- - Ugh. - Dumped me on the day of the prom? - Yeah, such a bitch. - I was so upset, I literally could not stop crying. - Oh. - Yeah, so I walked to his house, ready to have a showdown. Yeah? - I charged down his street. I saw all of his family and friends, all of his football broskis all outside on the front lawn, posing for their pictures. Their backs were to me, though, so they couldn't see me, and I was feet away and about to begin this blood curdling rant about his tiny little micro penis- - Oh my God. - And then a man in a lucha libre wrestling mask- - No. - Rocking a Walkman, singing "America the Beautiful" at the top of his lungs, was streaking by, waving a giant sign that said, "Don's a pussy," absolutely naked, between the crowd and the photographer. - Oh my God. Oh my God, I wondered why he bought that lucha libre mask. - My God. - Yeah. What the fuck? Yeah, there's literally nothing he wouldn't do for us. - Hey, I have an idea. - Yeah?

Anyway, I thought I'd start out with Ira Feinman at Band Camp. Yes, it was me that stapled your shit stained underwear to the cafeteria wall. What I didn't know is that your mom wrote your name in your underwear, and I'm so, so sorry about that. How was I supposed to know? Anyway, all right, that's all I got for now. Bye, guys.
