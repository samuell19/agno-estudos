Fine. Go. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. You have come, God. Guests have come to the temple. Protect them, God. Who are you, Baba? Son, I didn't ask you who you are. We live in a nearby village. I am a doctor. Oh, you are a doctor. What is so funny? No son, I thought you are a patient. Love too is a disease of a kind. If one catches any other... ...illness a person goes to the doctor and if one falls in love... ...a person comes to the temple. Very interesting. Yes. Did you find out anything about Lajjo? Not let it go. Oh God! What happened? Lajjo was in the river. She was washed away. - How? - Both of them were washed away. Who both? That our foreign doctor.

But he jumped and caught Lajjo's skirt. Then what... Sometimes Lajjo was up or the doctor. Then the doctor was up and Lajjo down. And you kept standing there and watching. Was I foolish like that doctor to give up my life just like that. Come, it was good. He was finished. Oh God! I didn't give birth to either a son or a daughter. I had got a orphan and taken care of her and you took her away too. [THUNDERING CLOUDS] From where did this fire come? Oh, are you performing the marriage? No, Lajjo is feeling cold. A hot body always catches cold. Here son, pull this over. Then what will you use, Baba? Son, what is left in this body to feel heat or cold. Yes... But I have just one. But no problem. You are kids you can do with one. Baba. No. What's to be ashamed of me? I am blind, dear. May Bholenath protect your pair. Hey boatman. Come here. Yes, in this direction. Hey come here. Why are you so troubled? The water has subsided. Someone must have left to look out for us. Both of us and in this lonely place. Not even for a few hours but for 3 whole days. This Bhairav baba is here but he too is blind. You are always doing God. God. He too was with us. Will he come to tell Aunty that we didn't commit any sin? Aunty will throw me out of the house. Lajjo, look there. Lajjo. Doctor babu... doctor babu. Lajjo. Lajjo, it's me. Lajjo. Chaudhary uncle. Lajjo has satyed three nights with that doctor. How will you keep her in the village? No, Bhushan. Our doctor is not like that. He has helped her. - He has protected her. - Yes to make her sit in the kotha. Bhushan! Now Lajjo has only two options left. Either she should commit suicide... ...go and sit at the brothel. Pandit, are you out of your mind? Chief, society can't accept her now. C'mon, Pandit. Let's announce this in the entire village. Till Lajjo is there in this village Uncle... ...is boycotted from this village. To hell with these villagers. Entire village is gossiping that... ...Lajjo has spent three nights with that stranger in a temple. Let them say anything they wish. Are you greater than the Lord Ram? Do you want me to take her fire test? LAJJO'S AUNTY: Now you tell me what will happen with her? Who will marry her and take her with him? I'll marry Lajjo. - Paras! - Yes, uncle. But I want to let you know something. I've grown up in the orphanage. I don't know anything about my family background. These are the old stories. I know you and that's enough for me. You've said yes and have saved us from getting ruined. Okay then you start with the preparation of marriage. I'll go to the city and take the blessings from doctor uncle. Who's this doctor uncle? He has spent on my education and made me a doctor. I'm under his obligation. If I offer my entire life servicing him then too it's not enough. It's very important to take his blessings at such time. Yes, my child. You please go and take his blessings. I'll get you both married at the very next moment of your arrival. - Bye! - Long live. Ganga! Did you hear this? What's the matter, papa?

She must be a modern girl from city. Modern girl from city? But who's he? Who are his parents? Ask about his address. Try to find out about his lineage. What to know about the lineage? His head is so brightening like Gods... ...and sweet smile like them. Divinely brightness in eyes. He seems to be a superior class Brahmin. In fact he can't be any other than the Brahmin. You're leaving me alone and going to the city? I'll come with the procession from there. Then why Ganga was telling me that you're... ...getting married with some other girl? Oh, I see... so this is Ganga's tricks? She has made fun with you. - What? - Of course. Will I be able to live without you for a single moment?

"My song will spread fragrance..." "Your love will become passionate..." "My love will spill over..." "Do not put flowers in your hair..." "My song will spread fragrance..." - You sing so well, Paras. So well. - Thank you. [APPLAUSE] And now the auspicious announcement. Ladies and Gentleman. You all are once again invited to come to the same place... ...on the 15th of next month to bless my daughter Manju. Because that day my daughter Manju... ...will be engaged with Dr. Paras. [APPLAUSE] - Congratulations! - Thank you! Thank you, my child. - Listen! You're also crazy after him? - Very much. But I promise. I won't come in your ways. - What if he'll feel bad? - Oh, c'mon. Go! Aye! Are you sleeping? Meena was saying that your male doll is a foolish person. He's has not yet open his doll's veil from last ten years... I hope you won't do that. - Haribabu! - What's the matter? Also keep one cold water bottle in my room. Okay, I'll bring it, sir. Manju! Are you coming from Paras's room? No! No! Yes. But Paras is sleeping, daddy. He's sleeping. - Sleeping? - Yes. [CHUCKLES] He must be acting. He won't be able to sleep tonight. - Why? Why, daddy? - It happens, my child. - What happens? - When two people get engaged... Daddy, aren't you ashamed? You've spoiled all the milk. What's wrong with you? Everybody is scolding me. Now I won't talk with all of you. - Who has scolded you, my child? - I won't tell you. Okay, don't tell. What did you tell her, sir? She's disappointed. I didn't tell her anything. Hariya, today suddenly I reminded of my childhood. I feel like laughing deep from the heart. Okay, then laugh. There's no tax on laughing. HARIYA: If madam would be alive today you'd have seen her laughter. Yes, Hariya. Today I miss her the most. I really miss her a lot. - When will you return from the city? - Within 2-4 days. If you'll take 2-4 months, you'll find me dead. - No. You should not talk such negative things while seeing off anybody. Okay, tell me something. What gift shall I bring for you from the city? You just come back soon. That will be the biggest gift for me. Okay, I'll come back soon. Padma, I wish you'd be alive today. I'm marrying our Manju with Paras. This was your wish that society might not consider... ...Paras, a rascal and hate him ever in life. I've done that same. Today Paras is also very happy. He could have never imagined that the house in which... ...he had got shelter, one day he'll own that house. No, uncle. Let the sand of feet remain under the feet. It can't be made a sandal to apply mark at forehead. What's the matter, Paras? Aren't you happy with this relation? Manju is eligible for you from every aspects. But I'm not eligible to her. I had never imagined this relation ever in my dream. But we had decided about this from long back. Manju loves you from the bottom of her heart. Uncle, I too lover her... ...But I've never loved her this way. Paras. Do you love somebody else? Yes, I've decided to marry Lajjo in the village. With whose permission you've taken this decision? I had come to take your blessings. No, Paras. No. A father can't bless you at the sake of his happiness. You must marry Manju. But uncle, if I won't marry Lajjo she'll commit suicide. And if you won't marry Manju... ...she'll die in your pinning. She loves you from her childhood. - But I don't love her. - Paras! Perhaps we made a mistake in knowing you. - I'm sorry, uncle. - No! No! Go! Get lost from here. But listen. For God's sake please do not tell this to... ...my daughter that you don't love her. Go! Go away! C'mon, hurry up and stop the road. C'mon. - Bhusan! - Yes, sir! - Is everything done properly? - It's fit, sir. Today doctor should not reach to the village. Otherwise we'll miss Lajjo from out trap. Sir, today doctor's dead body will reach to the village and not the doctor. C'mon, hurry up! Pick it up. - He's coming. - You please hide. C'mon, sir. Do not escape. He ran away. Catch him. Hold him. [Indistinct] [Indistinct] Pick him up. C'mon, everybody give your hand. Let's go. Put him here. Move aside. - Move away! - Move now. Let him die here. No need to worry. Very soon he'll get back his consciousness. But some other people are also getting unconscious here. - You must treat them too. - What? I didn't get you. What will you do by knowing it? There are some injuries that have no treatment in our medical science. Right? Let's go. Uncle hasn't come today? He has gone to clean up the bungalow with the garden. Bungalow with the garden? Why? Now I don't have any place in uncle's house? Because from there you'll come to my house with the procession, isn't it? Procession? Aren't you getting bored sitting over here? Now let's go out for a walk. - Please... c'mon! - Hi! - Hi, Manju! Hello, Paras! - How do you do? What's the matter? What's the matter, Manju? Your fiancé seems to be off mood. Yes, he's little disturbed after accident. Has he become a Devdas? I hope he hasn't found some other Parvati. - Who will be the Parvti? You? - I can only play a role of Chandramukhi. What do you mean? - Meaning... tomorrow night... - Tomorrow night... "The night is so pleasing..." "It's drizzling around... c'mon, darling." "The night is so pleasing..." "It's drizzling around... c'mon, darling." "Little... little..." "The wind is so breezing." "Heart might not get carried away." "I can't convince my heart." "Little... little..." "The night is so pleasing..." "It's drizzling around... c'mon, darling." "The wind is flowing in such away..." "The bud is about to blossom." "Where are you walking away?" "My heart is so empty without you." "The wind is flowing in such away..." "The bud is about to blossom." "Where are you walking away?" "My heart is so empty without you." "Our love story..." "...is discussed amongst people... c'mon, darling." "Little... little..." "The night is so pleasing..." "It's drizzling around... c'mon, darling." "Let the world feel jealous today." "When the two hearts are uniting." "Forget the sorrows of life." "Let's walk towards the destination." "Let the world feel jealous today." "When the two hearts are uniting." "Forget the sorrows of life." "Let's walk towards the destination." "Let's spend the life with fun and happiness My darling..." "Little... little..." "The night is so pleasing..." "It's drizzling around... c'mon, darling." "Let's talk through eyes..." "...and breath in hug." "My desires are going beyond control." "Let's fulfil our dreams." "Let's talk through eyes..." "...and breath in hug." "My desires are going beyond control." "Let's fulfil our dreams." "Thirsty rivers are getting crazy." "Let it set in the ocean... c'mon, darling..." "Little... little..." "The night is so pleasing..." "It's drizzling around... c'mon, darling." "Little... little..." - Mister! - Are you drunk? Please walk beside the road. Lajjo! Here's your destination. How come she's here? Mister, what are you looking at? This is a new bird came in the trap. Look at her after two days. When Chandabai... ...will train her and adorn her and put her in the market. By swear of God! People will shower sacks of rupees. C'mon, my child! C'mon. Only 100 rupees? I won't take any less than 200. If you don't want then c'mon... Take this and get lost. My child, what's your name? Lajjo. Do you have any relatives? Who? Father? Mother? Husband? - Then who's he? - God! Then no problem. C'mon. [DOORBELL] Where were you wandering till late night? You've still not gone home? Uncle must be worried. He knows where his daughter must be at this time. Its nearly mid night now. C'mon, I'll drop you home. Please drop me in the morning. Not now. I don't like the river flowing out of it's shore. And I also don't like people pretending... ...to be very firm with the principles. Will you become Rambha or Menaka? Yes. To break up the meditation of Vishwamitra like you I must become Meneka. Otherwise I'll remain thirsty forever. If you'll shower everything today only... ...then what will you have for your husband after marriage? You do not have the habit to express your feeling. If I'll keep feeling shy I'm afraid I might not loose you. Please accept the one who is created for you. Please accept it, Paras. You're not in your sense today. For a while, you too become unconscious once again. No, Manju. I can't ditch uncle. Paras! Manju! Love and hatred have very less distance. The thin wall between a wife and a co-wife... ...is only the shame in our eyes. - I'm going. - No. I'm going. But remember. If I'll become Mira in this birth... Then you too won't find any Radha in this life. Dan you'll keep longing for love in your entire life. [ENGINE REVVING] PARAS: If you'll shower everything today only... ...then what will you have for your husband after marriage? PARAS: The thin wall between a wife and a co-wife... ...is only the shame in our eyes. [TYRE SCREECH] "It's difficult... very difficult..." "...to get burnt, to melt." "When the candle has been put out..." "...that when the moth has come." "You can come in any form." "I'm offering this string bells to him." "You can come in any form." "I'm offering this string bells to you." "These restless bells will recognise you." "You can come in any form." "I'm offering this string bells to you." "My desires are crossing the limits..." "...how to control the styles?" "My desires are crossing the limits..." "...how to control the styles?" "It might not hug you with yearning." "Heart is out of control. And my bells too." "Heart is out of control. And my bells too." "The heart that you've already lost..." "...now you're searching for it?" "The heart that you've already lost..." "...now you're searching for it?" "You're searching for the killer on this threshold of simplicity." "This bells might not pierce any arrow into your heart." "This bells might not pierce any arrow into your heart." No! This is not possible. I won't let this happen. "Try to hide the sight. Try to save your heart." "Try to hide the sight. Try to save your heart." "Come closer to me. Or go far away from me." "These bells will definitely send the message..." "...of a heart to the other heart." "These bells will definitely send the message..." "...of a heart to the other heart." "These restless bells will recognise you." "You can come in any form." "I'm offering this string bells to you." Wow! Wow, Ratnabai! Well danced! Today you've ruined us. I felt as if some divinely fairy is dancing in the heaven. [CHUCKLES] What a beauty! Yes, bring it to me. Here... Ratnabai! Why did you hide the God quality product? No! Wow! What a style! Not only her eyes but her walking style is also like a deer. - She's blind, sir. - Is that so? But I hope Ratnabai won't take interest... ...in somebody else stopping in me. What do you say? - C'mon, now. - Take care. She has gone away. [INDISTINCT] Ratnabai, take this. And send her to my bungalow. [INDISTINCT] Is he a man or a demon? He's a rich man. - And what are you? - We? Whatever we're today is your creation only. Any big shops can close down without customer. Shame on such customers and such shops. Did you ask her whom you've dealt just now? Why are you feeling so pity for her? Doctor, if you're feeling shy of going alone then I'll send some men with you. You've felt bad, Chandabai. I mean to say you've dealt her in cheap rate. So you pay more and take her away. Take this. Thank you very much. May you earn more! Abdul! Girl is a diamond. Come soon. Find out Doctor's bungalow's address. He only will bring her and get her back from there. Keep this. Will his eyes be fine, doctor? I can't say anything. I might need to operate her again. If Madan won't get his sight back... ...what will happen with me? You've not married him. You can choose somebody else. Manju! You might not know about my love for him. I can't live without him. Nowadays lovers just threaten us to die. But I've yet not seen anybody dying. But this time you'll surely see one. Not one... but two death. Why two? You think your lover will also die? - Impossible. - Not he, but you'll die. If Madan won't get back his eyes I won't spare you. O God! So much of anger? For this stupid? He's my life. So one more Mira has taken birth. I mean modern Mira. Don't worry, Hansa. Your love will get back his eyes. He'll definitely get it. - Have you come, Mr. Abdul. - Yes, doctor. I've brought Lajjo with me. If she'll remain alive I'll take her back tomorrow morning. What do you mean? Has she come here to die? This is a kind of death for any cultured girl. Till today I kept on protecting her. But today money has made Chandabai witch. She's going to offer her today. Uncle, I'll die but won't let anybody touch me. Have you forgotten the beating of Chandabai's goon? They have adorned your dead body and sent here. Tyrant woman. Aren't you being tyrant? Woman's chastity... No, it's not that. Trust me. Woman will be given due respect in this house. She won't be ashamed here. - Go, my child! Go! - Uncle! The boat trapped in the storm has only God's support. Go, my child. My lord! Now you're the protector. - This... is this your wife's bed? - Yes, it is. But she has yet not come in this room. Please have a seat. You're still bachelor. And that's why you came to the market... No. You're misunderstanding. - I had gone there only for you. - For me? Why? Who are you? Your voice seems familiar. I hope you're not that demon! Demon! Who? The one who cheated me with love and brought me to this sinful world. I don't want to take his obligation. See, I'm not the one that you're thinking of. I just want to know how come you became blind? You were not blind before. How do you know? I'm a doctor. I can see the eyes and can say that it's a fresh case. It must have been very beautiful at times. Yes. That treacherous was also saying this. He was also a doctor like you. He made me crazy in his love. He promised me to marry and went to the city to come with a procession. But he didn't return. I kept on waiting for him in the bride's dress. "O girl, adorn yourself and get ready..." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." "O girl, adorn yourself and get ready..." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." "The pendant is so beautiful in your parting..." "The pendant is so beautiful in your parting..." "The pendant is so beautiful in your parting..." "The pendant is so beautiful in your parting..." "The necklace is also adding into your beauty." "The necklace is also adding into your beauty." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." "O girl, adorn yourself and get ready..." "...your groom will come anytime with a procession." The auspicious time is passing away. I don't think that doctor will come now. - He has ditched us. - No, Pandit. Doctor is not that type of a person. You please have patience. He'll definitely come. But when? When Lajjo will also be blamed for the marriage break? Then? "The necklace is also adding into your beauty." - Now she's matured enough. This is her right age to get marry. How long you'll let her remain spinster at home? Uncle, we're just coming from the city. Doctor is getting married over there. Am I right, Bhushan? Yes, sir. How will the city's boy marry a village girl? He has just taken pleasure for few days and has gone. These city's boys are like that. What? - Such a big fraud? - O God! Now I don't find any solution. No, Pandit. We've one solution. This Kishor is right there in front of you. He's a Brahmin by cast. Make him groom and get her marry with him. With this addicted boy? Chief uncle. Mind your language. Shut up! Instead it's better that I kill Lajjo. Now let go off with your position. I can't let my daughter remain unmarried for long. - Pyare! - Yes. You please go and get him ready. I'll arrange for the marriage. Pandit, have you gone mad? Why are you spoiling your daughter's life? Chief, it's enough now. C'mon, I'll make you groom. Uncle, you please start with the preparation. She's there... c'mon, follow her. Run! Catch her. Search for her around. I jumped in the river to die. I didn't die. But my destiny took away my eyesight and sent me to the brothel. All this has happened because of that deceitful doctor. Possible that the doctor was helpless. No, sir. Don't take his name. My hatred will ruin me. My healed wounds will become fresh again. Okay, fine! I won't fresh up your wounds. Tomorrow morning I'll take you to the doctor for your eye's treatment. Tomorrow morning Abdul uncle will take me to the brothel again. Now you won't go anywhere. I'll give the treatment to your eyes. For what greed? Sir, what you must be expecting is never going to be possible. I can't accept anybody else in my life. Never in my life. There's no question of acceptance. I just wish to bring your eyesight back. Atleast the hatred you've for that doctor will reduce to some extent. Now you please go to sleep. You're really a Godly man. Yes. Perhaps you could see the real form of this Godly man. It's just a fantasy of your eyes that you see in him. You'll die like a thirsty deer to obtain him. Perhaps this is my destiny. This is your fantasy. There's no shortage of boys in the city. All top most boys are ready to marry you. But I would never say yes. And if you'll bother me more. - I'll take poison and die. - Manju! Look, my child. Please try to understand me. I'm not your enemy. I don't mind if Paras agrees. You've waited from so many years. Can't you wait for some more time? Daddy. Perhaps he has not yet become normal after that accident. When the traveller misleads from his destination... ...circumstances mislead him more. But he knows his destination, daddy. I just need to develop love in him. And God knows when that love will be developed. - I might not die before that. - No, daddy. No. Destiny can't be so rude with us. Never, daddy. - Greeting, doctor! - Mr. Abdul. Please have a seat. Not there. Sit here. Have you spent the entire night here? I want to tell you something very important. What's the matter? Is the girl alive? If you wish Lajjo to remain alive then go and tell... ...Chandabai to forget her forever. And if she'll try to create any commotion... ...then I'll complaint with the police that... ...she has kidnapped a cultured girl. You won't need to take this step, sir. I'll tackle Chandabai and her goon. Will you be able to tackle them alone? I've always committed crime in my life. Today only God has given me this opportunity to do some virtuous task. As it is when a true Muslim... ...comes to his self-esteem, he can face any big demon. Okay then, you please go, Mr. Abdul. Lajjo will stay here now. She's the ornament of this house. Have you come, sir? You were awakening for the whole night, right? Who was awakening? Doctor. - But who are you? - I must ask you this. Doctor does not have any relative. Then who are you? I'm a boat surrounded with storms. It has no shore available. Then how come you're here? From Chandabai's brothel. From brothel? Perhaps doctor felt pity on this blind and helpless girl. So you're from a brothel. Even the river Gang's water sold at liquor shop... ...is considered liquor. But who need to wash his sins in river gang's water over here? Doctor has come down to this level now? No, he hasn't come down. Actually, I want to come up with his support. By drowning me? Haven't you got any other house to ruin? Don't put this charge on me. Perhaps you've a very delicate relation with doctor. When the brothel's flowers are decorating this house... ...all the relations have ended now. Tell your doctor. That even the God at the temple is nothing more... ...than a stone after loosing his credit. Please listen to me. - Manju had come here? - Please stop her, sir. Otherwise I'll be blamed for spoiling your house. The house where you'll step in, can that house even ruin? No, sir! The tree under which I'll take shelter... ...even the lightening will fall on it. Why are you spoiling your life for me? When I've never got life's happiness how will I ruin? The crack in the mirror can never be sealed. Some delicate relations never unite if it's broken once. - You please convince her. - Okay, I'll convince her. But you don't know Manju. She's a big doctor. She only will treat you. She'll do? But who will use the poison as medicine? Only a doctor will use it. Who has complete knowledge of medicine and poison. [SIGHS] What happened? Have you again made any accident? Yes, a biggest accident. This time my life met an accident. Now did you realise? Perhaps you're paying for your deeds. What do you mean? Those who spread darkness in others life... ...her own life also cannot have a brightness. Are you talking about Madan's accident? That was not an accident. It was your jealousy. Because you can't see any body smiling with love. Hansa, you're crossing your limit. You too are crossing your limits. I'm telling you. You'll never get the extremity of love. - Everybody will hate you. - You? What happened? Hello doctor! - Are you going to meet Manju? - Yes. I want to talk to her about Lajjo's operation. She's very angry. Now she's also being violent. Is that so? She's also being violent? Hansa's pain won't be felt by punishing yourself? Why did you slap her? She's already suffering. Then you do away with her suffering. This is your habit to help poor and low-grade people. Those whom you consider low grade are at your level only. Are you comparing me with a prostitute? Manju! She's my first love whom you've said prostitute. Lajjo is pure Gang water from Sonpur village. But this so called high society people want to drag her into wrong business. Please save her. I'll never forget your obligation. - What do you wish? - I want her eyes to be operated. She's not blind by birth. Please give her the eyesight. So that my life will become dark? Paras, I'm not so foolish that I'll light lamps in the temple... ...by making darkness in my own house. Manju! Such foolish people are always worshiped later. Great person like Dr. Kotnis was also considered foolish. Whom you're explaining, Mr. Paras? This is not that stone that can be worshiped at the temple. Yes, I'm the stone of the road. I don't need to be worshiped in your temples. You please go away from here. Please go. Hansa, you please go out. At Lajjo. Doctor, duty is much more than emotions. You're born to give the lights to the blinds. Don't bring your love in the ways of your duty. Why don't you learn this lesson of duty? I've loved you from the bottom of my heart. I've worshiped you by keeping away all my dreams. You don't have any duty towards me? Please answer me. Why are you silent now? Aren't you forgetting your duties while in love with Lajjo? I'm giving her this treatment as part of my duty. Otherwise she just hates me. - But you still love her. - Not love, Manju. This is the feeling of love. True love always demands the sacrifice. If you can believe me then I promise... ...you that I will never face Lajjo after her eyes get operated. And also won't come in front of me. You please go away from here. Please go. Go away. [SOBBING] - Where are you going, Lajjo? - To wander in the dark path. I'm not destined for eyesight. Don't say that. Now you'll be operated. You'd be able to see. Will I be able to see somebody's ruined life or those changed sights... ...that will have mercy instead of closeness for me. You need to have the eyesight to live the pure life. Get it operated atleast for your necessity and not as the obligation. C'mon. - Doctor! - Hmm! - This is my declaration form. - Declaration form. Please take out my eyes and give it to Madan. Have you gone mad? - Shall I make you blind to give him sight? - When I love him... ...I won't let his world remain dark. And what if he'll scorn you? What difference it will make? Moonlight loves moon. So what if moon do not love her. Silly girl. Don't get carried away with your emotions. You'll repent. Lovers are ready to give their life for their love. Whereas I'm just giving my eyes. I'm not a hard hearted like you. Take out my eyes and give the sights to my love. If you won't grant it. I'll go somewhere else. No, please don't say that. I'll give eyes to your love. Definitely. - When you failed to give eyes to your love... ...how will you give it to my love? You're just pretending to love. You don't have love for anybody in your heart. There's just hatred in it. No, please don't say that. I accept my defeat. You go and bring operation. I'll operate her. - I'll definitely operate her. - Doctor! [PHONE RINGING] Hello! Dr. Paras speaking. Who's it? Hansa? Yes, I'm Hansa speaking. - Yes, Manju is ready to operate. - She's ready? Thank God! - You please come soon. - Yes, I'm coming. Okay! - Doctor! - Yes. Are you sure my eyes will be normal again? Yes, once again you'll be able to see this beautiful world. - Is this world very beautiful? - Yes, for you. For me? And what about you? Tell me, doctor. Lajjo, season never last till one forest. What will I do with such seasons... ...that will have nightingale's painful songs? Why do you worry for others? That's what I want to ask you. Why are you spreading darkness in your life? It's doctor's duty to relive others from their pain. Cheers! Have a sip. Have it. Okay. - I'm sorry to disturb you sir. - Who's that? I'm like a family member. You've come after a long time? Where's your Lajwanti? I had brought her. But that Paras took her away. Paras! Why is he interested? He's her ex-lover. He has brought her here... ...for the treatment of her eyes. What are you saying? Is she blind? Not is. But she was. Now she's being operated. Very soon she'll be able to see. Then what are you waiting for? Take her away to my new bungalow. Okay, but... it'd be better if you could supply me few men because you know that... ...she might not create any chaos. Okay, you'll get the men. Now go back to your work. Sir, you know that nowadays... - Constraint of money, right? - Yes. That will be arranged. But you go and do your job first. Get lost. Hansa, why Paras is standing outside? - Call him inside. - He doesn't wish to come inside. He says those who consider him guilty... ...he doesn't wish to increase their hatred. Will you keep arguing or call him inside? Let it be, doctor. Perhaps he has no courage to see our pain. You too couldn't understand him. Take this! Now open your eyes slowly. Yes! See, the darkness of your life is going far away. Come! Look at here. How beautiful these flowers are? Full of life. And look at the first ray of sun. Now there's only brightness in your life. No! There's only darkness in my life. No, my life is in darkness. Your life is full of lights. Doctor! I can't see anything. I can't see anything. - I can't see anything. - No! Lajjo! No, doctor, I can't see. Leave me. Let me go from here. - You can see. - No, I can't. No. - You telling lie. - No, I am not telling lie. Please let me go from here. You've purposely spoiled her eyes. - No, this is a lie! It's a lie. - It's true. Doctor, you love Paras. And Paras loves Lajjo. You never wished Lajjo's eyes to get repaired and... ...Paras to go away from your life. No, this is wrong. I didn't spoil her eyes. - You're putting wrong charges on me. - I mean it. No, this is wrong. It's wrong. Paras! Paras! Paras! Paras! People are taking me wrong. Do you doubt me? No, Paras no! You don't doubt on me. No, Paras. You don't doubt on me! You too have started hating me. But I won't be able to tolerate this hatred any more. I'll die, Paras! I'll die. I'll die. Paras also thinks you're wrong? This is the biggest joke of my destiny. Daddy, now I'm fed of this life. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to live anymore. No, my child. You must not say that. You should not. Every beautiful thing has the spots somewhere. You too have started hating me. But I won't be able to tolerate this hatred any more. I'll die, Paras! I'll die, Paras! I'll die. 'When you failed to give eyes to your love...' '...how will you give it to my love?' 'You're just pretending to love. You don't have love for...' '...anybody in your heart. There's just hatred in it.' 'You've purposely spoiled her eyes.' 'Doctor, you love Paras. And Paras loves Lajjo.' 'You never wished Lajjo's eyes to get repaired and...' '...Paras to go away from your life.' 'No, this is wrong. I didn't spoil her eyes. - 'You're putting wrong charges on me. - I mean it.' 'No, this is wrong.' No! No! No! No! No! MANJU: Daddy, I'm fed of this life now. Everybody hates me. Even Paras.
