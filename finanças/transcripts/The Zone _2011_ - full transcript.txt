[Electronic score] I hope he's really nice. Yeah, I guess that is the kind of thing I should be thinking. Instead of my own selfish anti social... I hope that stuff too. [Laughs] You hope they fall in love and we don't have to talk to them? Uh huh. That would be the perfect combo. It would. Then they go away, like on a lovers... She goes to visit him for weeks at time. They run away on a lovers jaunt and we get the place to ourselves. [Exhales] Sounds like the best combo. We'll all be happy. [Rising music] [Indistinct chatter and music] [Laughing] [Cameraman] Just what would you like to pray for? You've prayed twice. I've prayed more than, I've prayed. Just not in this Christian fashion With the tag line at the end. Yeah, I'll try it. I'd like to pray for my mom who is sick with cancer. [Cameraman] I say, we pray to the Lord on that one. Will it work if I send you to start again? [Cameraman] It is my understanding that you do have to lock it in. I'd like to pray for my mom who is sick with cancer, that she recovers to her full health. - We pray to the Lord. [In unison] Lord hear our prayer. I'd like to pray for my friend Anna who's in the hospital And I hope that her leg gets better and she can walk again. - I pray to the Lord. [In unison] Lord hear our prayer. I'd like to pray to my mom. Who's all alone and lonely. [Man] You want to pray for her, to God. You don't want to pray to her. To the Lord. [Laughing] [In unison] Lord hear our prayer. [Strumming guitar] [Cameraman] I know what you mean. I know what you mean. The chords. I know what you mean. - I've read that book. - Oh really. I have read that book. - I got to the end too. - How did it turn out? It's a simple thing. You read it you figure it out. Yeah, I didn't... [Laughs] You learn to do stuff like. [Picking at guitar] - You learn that in the book right? - Yeah, the book teaches that. - That's pretty. - It is pretty, yeah, kind of. Makes it sound like you know I play a bit. Huh. [Woman] "Let's go somewhere." "- Now?" "I want to make some money at the pier. Where do you want to go Andrew?" "- I want to take you to South America. - Why there?" "- For the cazuela. - Alright, Bug, we'll go." "As she lay on the couch of his parents game room, "legs still trembling and wrapped around Andrew, "his cock growing softer inside her. "He kissed her then, searching for her tongue with his "and finding it just beyond her open mouth. "Soft and eager, their lips entwined. "And she could feel his cock grow hard again inside her pussy, "moving slowly, backwards and forwards. "She wrapped her legs tighter so that they could move together. "Andrew released her mouth and stared into her eyes "as they continued to fuck, tasting one another's breath and sweat. "Jan grabbed his hair with both hands and began to bite "and suck gently at his ear whispering "fuck me"... "Again and again. "He thrust his enormous cock deeper inside of her "and she threw her head back with a start, "only to find his hands there, waiting to catch it. "A great warmth consumed her "as forced his cock deeper and deeper inside of her virgin cunt, "his soft lips touching her neck, wetting it just a little, "drifting up to her ear as he let the words drift past: "Baby, you're going to make me come." "They grasped at one another's bodies as the orgasm shook them both at once. "Silence lay softly upon the room like a sheet over unused furniture. "The couple lay side by side, half awake, half asleep. "- Will we really go, Andrew? - Where?" "To South America." "Yes, Bug, when I've made enough money at the pier." So that's the first chapter, I guess. What do you think? [Blowing] [Blowing harder] [Blowing] [Cameraman] Are you as happy as I am about the way that turned out? Oh, yeah I'm thrilled. Looks like a real sunburn. - It's very fun. - It's very fun. - It's not like your normal sunburn. - No, it doesn't hurt. You know we've always wanted sunburns that are fun, right? Course, because we like the sun so much, but we hate the burn. The one thing that was like real sunburn was how cold it was when you... put the pigment. Take the strap down, see how it's... Yeah. - It works. - Do you think it's the same on both sides? I don't know. Yeah. Lift this. Lift the bottom up. Up or down. - That one's good. - That's good. - Do you want to check this out? Really strong line. That one's strong. Why don't you stand up? [Laughs] [Kissing] [Kissing] [Shower] - Is it the right temperature yet? - Too hot. I never did it. You know how to work this thing? Should just come right off correct? We'll find out, yeah, it's cool, it's tie-dye. [Light switch] [Light switches off] [ * 'When Love Breaks Down' by Prefab Sprout plays at wrong speed.] [Record skips] [Running tap] [Cameraman] Where's your boyfriend? Oh, I didn't see you there. Um. He's out playing basketball. Basketball? I didn't know he was the athletic type. - What were you doing over there? - Just washing some dishes. Well, how was your progress? I didn't mean to interrupt you. That's okay. Which dish were you on? The second to last dish. - Why don't you finish them up? - Yeah. [Tap comes on] - What goes on that top shelf? - The bowls. [Laughing] [Cameraman] What accents do you do? - I do all accents. - All accents. - Uh huh. Can we get started with them? - Name one and I'll do it. - Let's run through them. Okay, softball, British. Oh yes, I do a British accent very well, because I spent a lot of time there. I was on my way to the theater there and I decided to stay for quite some time. I was involved in a lot of drinking of tea. Also... That was very good. That was very good. Can you do different American accents? - What's the one? - I can do all, I can do Southern. Do Southern. All right well, you see when I go ahead and I do Southern accents, what it really reminds me of is the time I went to down to my family reunion. And I didn't even know how many cousins I had when I was doing that. I had twenty-five cousins. And that was from just one person. That was a real motivating experience for me. I realized I needed to have kids sooner, as I needed to have a lot more of them. - Speed round. German. - German is very interesting. Because in Germany they eat a lot of sauerkraut and a lot of sausages and they drink a lot of beer. Japanese. Oh, I study to be a sushi chef. When I was there, I realize I don't need to study. I just come to straight the United States and do the sushi all alone, no training, I get paid more. I don't waste money on education. Vietnamese. No, that sounds too much like Vietnamese, I mean that sounds too much like Japanese. It's going to sound the same. Okay, what about Russian? Oh, Russian is very good. You drink enough vodka to make sure that when you go to Siberia that you don't get cold. [Both laugh] This is very good, okay what about Iraq? In Iraq, it is. I don't think I've ever heard an Iraqi person say anything. I don't know if I can do that. [Rising music] [Moaning] [Heavy breathing] [Shower water] [Key in lock] [Door opening] [Door shutting] [Laughs] [Cameraman] So, twenty-five points? Yeah. Sounds, like you've really got out of your slump. - That's exciting. - Triple double. 25, 10 and 10. What you get, ten rebounds and ten steals. - First time in two years. - Ten reebs? Yeah, ten boards. Thirteen assists. Twenty five points. And I was hitting from all over. Three point land. Fifteen footers. - Drive, dunks, reverse lay-ups. Hooks. - You can't dunk, can you? I can dunk. Sure boy, you kidding me. Try that again with... what accent is that? What's up? What accent is that? I don't know, just a general. I don't know trying to do kind of a Larry Bird kind of thing. Let me hear your stats. Just you know, straight forward how you would say them. You have some enthusiasm but let me just hear your... - Just my stats. - It's exciting you got out of your slump. - I didn't sound excited. - You sounded a little goofy. Sounded like what? You sounded a little playful and goofy. - This is dead serious. - This is dead serious. - Alright. - Just play it... You know, a quiet composure you have about you. Like I'm a warrior. Like I'm that kind of player. You broke out of you slump, but geez, you know, like what do you expect. - I'm going to break out of my slump. - So, I'm a little pissed at the question. [Violin music] [Kissing] [Man] Alright, that's it. That's the end of the cut as it stands right now. [Laughing] What was that sigh? [Blinds going up] I'm nervous to give my notes. Cause, I'm in my head about it. That's all. Do you want notes? I don't know. I have my own notes. My own thoughts. I think that... I really like it actually. I think it's good. I think it's good that he's mysterious. Maybe we could know a little more of whom he is. I think that the sex passages are unbalanced. And, this is why I'm nervous about saying it. I don't want to sound like a selfish actor who wants more screen time. I also don't want to seem like like a dude who wants to have a sex scene with Kentucker who clearly doesn't enjoy them with me at least. - Or me, but with Kate. - Or with me. No don't worry. I think that they are unbalanced. Like Kate's in really long and great. Sophia's is really great too and slightly shorter than Kate's. - And mine is really brief. - Yeah. You might be running the risk of showing your into girls. So, obviously you're more erotic with that. - And then like... - What are we trying to say? I may just be a selfish person that may just want more screen time. I think that's totally valid cause what are we trying to say when we have two invisible guys basically. It's almost like we're scared to have them touch each other. I'm not dying to do more sex scenes with him but and it's probably too late anyway. It's too late in some sense. The only devise we have left is the iPhone. [Joe Swanberg] So, I'm just going to use my voice and we'll just replace it with Kentucker's. Wait, why does it go negative? Ok, I think we're good now.p So, I'm going to prompt you and whatever things I say we can just replace it with Kentucker's voice, okay? - Does that make sense? - Yeah, if it can be anybody, why, why? Wouldn't make more sense to be my fiancé than you who probably don't want to see this? - I don't know, maybe you do. - Oh right, I didn't think about that. - I would just feel more. - Hey Sophia, come here ! - What do you want me to do? - Touch your balls. Touch my balls? Just like that. Yeah, cup them. I don't know it doesn't make your cock big. You have to think about what Kentucker. You have to think director wise what Kentucker would have done. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, he would have been like [mumbles] I definitely know what he would do visually. Yeah, also you can't talk more than he would talk. I'm going to go, I'll be back guys. - You want to wait until he's out. - Yeah. [Door closes] [Door locks] - So go. [Whispers] - Much better with you in here. - Than with Joe? [Whispers] I don't know what to do. What would you like to see, I forget the note. I am saying like for for the sex scenes, he doesn't really talk. - You're getting hard. - Yeah. That's cool. - I mean if we're [mumbles] Stop, do what I say, just wait. He can come in at any time. Yes, spread your legs out. I don't know. And now I guess. I like it when you... sometimes when you do not a long stroke. Not slower... just less... [Laughs] Forget that it's a movie. What would you want to see? Ok. [Laughs] You know, who knows what Kentucker was thinking. Alright, so. Should I move over here? More room. Look at me, look at the camera, and stroke your cock. What are you thinking about when you do it? I'm looking at you. This stupid movie has been going on. We haven't had time to have sex. Do you think he would ask you turn around and like show your ass. If he was gay probably. Would you like to see that? - Yeah I'd like to see it. - Like this? I don't know. Yeah. Want to see it from the side? Yeah, I can see how big your penis is. [Cameraman] Okay, will you clap for me in front of your face. [Coughs] All right. There's this sort of... It's just like it was a little bit stupid. The shot of you and Kentucker laughing, it was a bad idea I had. So I just want to cut into this and this will cut into the iPhone stuff. So, just stare right into the camera. - And then what? [Laughs] Wait. Wait. Make a serious face. Sorry, how serious? Angry serious? Be a little afraid of him. - If he were the camera. - Okay. Let me see a little more smile in your eyes. Afraid but excited a bit. This is hard. Laugh. [Laughs] Now be serious. Be suspicious. I think it looks great. - We're going to have a threesome. [Woman] Are we still doing that? I don't even know if we're doing that. I have no idea if we're doing that or not. - My mom had a dream that... - Your going to kiss my lips. we were going to have a threesome. - Remember that Sophia? - That was a while ago yeah. [Laughs] - Do you remember that? - That's practice. Remember that dream. My mom had a dream. She's like don't have a threesome, it was going to ruin your relationship. I had a dream that you were going to have a threesome and it was going ruin your relationship. - And your mom's psychic. - For a movie. - And my mom's psychic. - It was for a movie in the dream right? - I don't remember. Was it for a movie? - I don't remember. - It was the three of us wasn't it? - It was, yeah, the three of us. - Oh, that's so weird. [Woman] Your mom's been psychic before. She's been psychic before. She's had episodes. What was she psychic about before? She came home one day from work and was really really really tired and the cleaning lady was there. So, my mom came home from work, really really tired, fell asleep and had a dream that a car came driving through our front yard, and went into our back yard which was a jungle. Then hit a tree in the jungle. And then a grownup fell out of the front seat of the car, then four children came running out of the back seat. The first one got eaten by a lion. The next one got eaten by a snake. And the next one got eaten by whatever, some other jungle animal and the forth one ran up a tree and survived by eating bananas in the tree and while all the animals tried to get... and then it turned out while my mom was asleep, that the cleaning lady had gotten a phone call that her child - was lost in the jungle, - Whoa. on a field trip and then... [Woman] People had died. - They didn't know. They didn't know where anyone was. Well my mom said, that I just had a dream and if that's the case then your son is alive and about a week later she found out that indeed he was alive and he survived by climbing up a tree and eating bananas. - Seriously? - Isn't that crazy? That's the most insane thing I've ever heard. It almost makes me not want to have a threesome. Yeah, it does make me... I'm serious, I don't want to do it anymore. [Knock at the door] Come in. [Laughs] [Swanberg] What are you laughing at? Sorry. [Laughs] That was Kate, and I was like they are going to blame me. [Swanberg] What was Kate? - That was not my stomach. That was my stomach. Someone else's stomach growled and I was like they are going to blame me. [Swanberg] Alright, I got enough of it, it's fine. We'll move on to the next thing. We'll kill the audio. [Laughs] You guys can kiss if you want. You guys can kiss too, even though I like all of the attention. [Laughing] Alright. I thought it said something in the script about who's supposed to kiss who. - Yeah, but... - I start kissing you first too. - Yeah. - I don't know. - In the outline. - Okay. [Swanberg] You guys want to keep going or stop? No, I want to keep going. - I thought that worked really well. - Don't worry about... scrap the outline. - Just make out. - When if feels right, yeah. Then I'll cut it. Okay. Starting from where? - From the top. - It's unclear when what feels right? [Swanberg] For you and Kate to engage. Oh, man. I think maybe it's best if you just... [Swanberg] Prompt you from behind? I'm totally happy to do that Larry. Alright. Do what ever you want. [Swanberg] You guys want to stop. - No. I just feel that if you gave somebody the agency to do it then it would take a lot of pressure off us. You know what I mean? Like if I decide to kiss Kate that's going to effect Sophia... [Swanberg] Kate you kiss Larry. - ...in real life. - Kate's going to kiss you, all right? - Thank you. The camera can't see your pretty face. [Swanberg] I'm still rolling. You want me to roll back over or is this position okay? That was good when you were up on your shoulder. So start down and get up. Go head guys. [Laughs] No camera, no more cameras. [Woman] Oh no, I just want to have this to remember as a memento. We've been shooting all day. I feel like enough with the cameras already, you know? Is anything sacred, can anything exist that is not on screen? No, okay apparently not. Did you like watching me kiss Kate? Did it really turn you on? [Laughs] Okay, okay. Interview over. Dude, I'm tired. I know but I just really want to know if all of your fantasies were fulfilled. [Laughs] No. When I was in the same bed with you and a woman. No that wasn't my fantasy and it wasn't fulfilled. - None of my fantasies were fulfilled. - And our tongues were touching. - I didn't like it. - You didn't like it? No, I didn't find particularly interesting. Did you not even get a boner? At what point? Which point are you talking about? At the point where Kate and I were making out with each other and not you. But I was in the room? You were just a bystander watching us. - A voyeur. - I was in this position. Like I'm in right now looking at you like that. At that point, did I have a boner? Did you enjoy watching it? In a sexual way? I couldn't really see it. I couldn't. I had a boner. Yeah? [Laughs] Such a dumb word. Yeah, I had one. You know that. Don't you remember? - Was it from watching me and Kate? - It was from the whole zeitgeist. Do you think it's from watching me kiss Kate and Kate kiss me? [Laughs] I don't know. I feel like... I'm being snared gently into a... - Trap? - Right. They feel really nice. They're soft and they taste really sweet and you keep kissing them. She's petting your head. She's holding your hair. You start to unbutton her pants but you don't but you just leave her pants unbuttoned. Then I walk in and you're really scared and you try to act like nothing is happened. She's sitting with her shirt off. You don't know how I'm going to react. But I sort of stand up for a second and you are really nervous. And then I walk over to Kate and I start to kiss her and since her pants are already unbuttoned, I stick my hand down her pants, I can feel how wet her pussy already is. I start to finger her while you watch and you start to take my shirt off and you start to my pants off. You start kissing my back and my ass and you start to finger my pussy while stroking your own cock. Kate's sitting there playing with her tits. Kate and I are kissing. I'm kissing. You start to come and you start to... I move my fingers away from Kate's vagina and you start to lick her pussy. It tastes really sweet, tastes like a ball of sugar and Kate and I are kissing while your licking her pussy... she's like groaning and moaning with pleasure. And then, you and I start to kiss while Kate starts to suck your cock. She's sucking your cock and taking it deep into her throat, really really deep, just like you like it. [Laughter on laptop] Shit, come on man. [Laughter] [On laptop] Come on, pull it together, it's still rolling. [On laptop] Kate are you trying not to kiss him? [Laughing] [On laptop] Do you not want to? - Do you want a break. - No. Let's do that. I thought I was supposed to kiss her eyelids, then she was supposed to kiss me on the mouth. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's totally supposed to happen, you said that. - Okay. - I'm being a moron. Your doing all the work. [Laughter] No, I've... I was ignoring the outline. I didn't want to push. I mean, sorry. [Swanberg sighs, coughs] [Woman] Just force us to have fun, and then we will have fun and then it will be safe that we had fun. Does that make sense? I fell as as long as your there guiding it and guiding the... not like the way Larry was... I can't make you have fun. I can't make you have fun though. I don't thing that's something I can force you to do. I think you can. Like... What Larry was asking for last time, just like tell us when to kiss when, like that's what made it stick. But if... Right, that's what made Larry feel safe. But that's because he's scared of me, not because... I know but by making this movie, I've put the two of you's relationship into any sort of jeopardy. It's awful, I don't want to do it. But why do you think you have that much power over us? I don't. I don't because in the past people have expressed... This is the future. This is the present. I know... I never thought I had that much power until people... got hurt and blamed me. - You know. - Right. People did things... and then felt hurt or taken advantage of by me. You know. I mean, I improvise. It's not like I've ever made anyone do anything or say anything but that doesn't change the fact that they got hurt. Doesn't that make them just like babies? No, it doesn't make them babies, it just makes me understand how loaded and complex the situation is. - You know? - Right. By creating the movie and creating the situation, I need to consider how much power I do or do not have. I'm not trying to make it seem like I have a bunch of power over you. Right. Or that I have the ability to ruin your lives by making a movie but if by making a movie your lives get ruined I'm certainly implicated in that, you know. Yeah. And also, weather you blame me afterwards or not, I still feel shitty about it. I want the work that I make to be helpful to people and useful to people. I don't want it to be hurtful. I don't want the movies to make the world a worse place. I want the movies to make people feel less alone and like they live in a better place with other like minded people. - Right. - You know... Yeah. But I also think that the stuff that we shot doesn't work and it is because it's too controlled. - It's too safe. - Right. I don't know how to make the threesome... It's not up to you. It can be fun and safe, if afterwards... If the three of you agree for it to be... Fun and safe. And then if afterwards Larry makes a real concerted effort to be really nice to me and not pay attention to Kate then it will be fine. [Both laugh] It can exist in the moment and that's it as long as afterwards people... And like I think it's totally okay to ask for that. You know what I mean? Like if I ask Larry after we do this, you can do whatever you want to Kate but afterwards I need you to pay only attention to me. Like just to negotiate it and establish different kinds of... Do you want to do that? Or would you rather we just not delve into that territory? I'd rather make a good movie. But I don't know that this will make it a good movie. That's subjective. But you know that it will make it better than if the threesome that's in there now is in it. Then that's what I want to do. God dammit. It's just, do you want us to end feeling empty or do you want us to find a solution? I guess is my question. Do you want us to find something in each other and ourselves that makes us move beyond his absence and his having left or do you want us to end in confusion and.. longing? What are you more interested in? [Sighs] Um... I'm sorry, what were the options? Confusion and longing what? Confusion and longing versus self realization or fulfillment without him. I think, well how do you feel about God? Confusion and longing or fulfillment without him? [Laugh] A little bit of both. That's the trouble. I want the scene to be at the beginning of the movie and I want to re shoot it. But I want you guys to think about what you sincerely want to pray for, that's bigger than yourselves. [Woman] I already know what I'm going to pray for. Not things that. You know what I mean. Like you all three of you prayed for personal things and stuff like that. I have a really good idea. Okay good and we'll do it without any irony. It's important to me that it's in the film without irony. Okay. Alright. - Are you guys ready to do it now? - Yeah. Just give me the camera and stay where you are. Who would go first? I have something to pray for. Can I go first guys? Uh huh. - And you guys remember afterwards. - We pray to the Lord. We pray to the Lord. As a group we say that. - That's it. - Yeah. I'd like to pray for all the people in all these countries that are fighting hard to... I don't want to say be free but that's the only thing I can think of. To change the situation of where they are. - I want you to think about it first. - But I did think about it. No I know, that's a great thing to pray for but think about how you want to phrase it. What are they doing? They are fighting oppression, political oppression, tyranny. So, I would like to pray for all the people around the world who are fighting against political oppression. [In unison] We pray to the Lord. - Lord hear our prayer, right. You say, we pray to the Lord than as a group we say Lord hear our prayer. Yeah, but don't make jokes. I can't make jokes in-between the prayers? I don't... this is what I'm saying. I want the tone of the prayers... I don't want it to be for the movie. Does it make sense? - Yes. - I want the four of us to do this. - Together. - A sincere prayer. - Yeah. - But it is a sincere prayer. - I know. - I know, I believe you too. You can actually let God fall off. [Whispers] [Laughs] Sorry. [Sighs] I'd like to pray for all the people who are fighting against political oppression around the world. - I pray to the Lord. [In unison] Lord hear our prayer. I'd like to pray for people who don't have anyone or know that they have people in their lives who care about them. So I'd like to pray for the people who feel alone in particularly people that are homeless. - I pray to the Lord. [In unison] Lord hear our prayer. I'd like to pray for all of the women in the world who are in abusive relationships and being physically abused by the men in their lives. I'd like to pray to the Lord that he gives them strength to help them find a way out of the situation and get help. - We pray to the Lord. [In unison] Lord hear our prayer. [Knock at the door] Come in. [Slapping] What the fuck! Jesus Christ. [Swanber] Hold up, whoa, whoa! Sophia! Stop it! [Shouting] Hey, cut it out. What the fuck are you doing? Are you fucking crazy? No, just excuse me. [Sophia sighs] You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. [Laughs] - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. [Shouts] Sophia. What the fuck? - Do you want me to go talk with her? - I guess I should do it. [Coughs] [Door shuts] - Sorry. - It's fine. I guess we're not doing the threesome. [Laughs] [Swanberg sighs] Fuck. I just don't want to be in the middle of this bullshit. [Door opens] [Sophia sighs] [Door closes] - You okay? - I'm really sorry. - You're sorry to her. - Technically. - Are you okay though? - I'm ready to do it again. [Swanberg] What? - That's not happening. - No, I don't want to do it again. [Swanberg] Don't be ridiculous. Where are you coming from with that? We're not going to do it again. I just wasn't prepared and now I am. [Laughter] [Larry] You just fucking attacked me. [Swanberg] I'm sorry I don't mean to laugh. [Swanberg] I don't want to shoot it again. [Larry] Yeah, we're not shooting it again. I'm not doing it again. [Larry] I mean no, we're not doing it again. That's it. Alright? - What? [Sophia] I just feel like... I put in all this time and now your like tired so you don't want to finish the movie. It's more... I'm physically tired and I'm also emotionally exhausted with dealing with these kinds of issues. - Well you created them. - I know, that's what I feel shitty about. Don't feel shitty. Just be like I did it and I don't want to do it any more. No, I can't be in the middle of this shit any more. I don't why I create it. You can't decide it when there is just one scene left. I don't even want to finish this movie, I want to fucking walk away from it and never again put myself in the position. Fine walk away from it by not making any more movies. I know. That's what I'm talking about. I already put in a lot of time, like I want to finish the movie. So, what? It's worth it to you to risk your relationship to fucking finish this movie? I'm positive it's not going to affect my relationship. - Yes, it is worth it to her. [Larry] It is worth it to her. Apparently to her. No, I just don't think it will affect my relationship. It is affecting your relationship. I just watched it affect your relationship. It affected my relationship with you. It was just a momentary thing. No, I'm not going to... I don't believe you. I can't do in anymore. I can't feel responsible for this stuff and I do. I'm going to walk you out. [Cameraman laughs] [Mumbling] [Whispering] Do you want to go to sleep? [Laughs] [Swanberg] It's just that thing. [Video stopping] It just becomes about you. [Baby gurgles] It just becomes another movie about you complaining about making movies. Where as in like the beginning it's exciting, your doing something new. Even when you pull out and it's a movie within a movie. It's still something you haven't done before but then it, you know, by the end it's just another movie where your complaining about directing movies. Right. [Baby whines and gurgles] So, I guess that's my main problem with it. It also seems a little thrown together, I'm not sure, I'm not sure I believe it when Sophia hits him. - Right. - During the threesome. - Right. - It also makes, it seems just like the same thing you did in Art History. Uh huh. [Laughs] I don't disagree with you... I know. And because your past few movies have just been about basically about you complaining about you making movies. It's sort of like another one is just you complaining about making movies about complaining about making movies... it's a little bit too much. Right. Do you? Do you feel like it's good? The second half? Uh, well... I definitely feel that it runs out of steam but I almost kind of felt like that or that became the point. It's like I just didn't have the energy or enthusiasm to finish the movie. So it just doesn't get finished. You know what I mean? It just kind of... Is that the point or is that just what happened? [Laughs] I don't think anyone will watch that and come away with "Oh, I get it, he ran out of steam and that's why the movie isn't you know..." Right. I think people will watch that movie and say "Aw man, "that the beginning was really awesome but then the second half "just seemed like he didn't know what he was doing "and he threw it together." What your saying is that is what happened. But that doesn't mean, I don't know... Right... Hold on. Alright, we have to put him to bed. Soon. [Singing] Oh, my sweet boy. Oh, my big boy. Oh, my humcle bunkle boy. Oh my sweetie, little cutie, oh my sweetie baby boy. [Shushes] [Baby cries] [Recording of a heartbeat] [Shushes]
