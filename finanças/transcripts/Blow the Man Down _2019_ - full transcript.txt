I mean, I’m already a year behind. UMaine has the hottest boys. -(laughs) -GAIL: Oh, Lord. Remember Mary Margaret wore these to Kate’s wedding? DOREEN: And her nice dress. SUSIE: And when we asked, she looked down and said, -"They’re from Paris." (laughs) -GAIL: Didn’t miss a beat. -Aw. -Yeah, I remember ’89. Yeah, three feet of water in the basement. Mary Margaret showed up in those boots at 1:00 a.m. with a sump pump. SUSIE: She saved my tush, too. (chuckling): More than a few times. Oh, my.

GAIL: Bullet wound, track marks. And we know she worked at Oceanview. DOREEN: We’ve been asking ourselves, who could have done this? What is this, the Inquisition? SUSIE: Enid, do you ever think about retiring? We were just thinking about some sort of travel club together. Go to Boca Raton, drink mai tais, get an Irish tan. Not ready to go full vegetable yet, Suze. Maybe it’s time for a change. You want to shut down my business? SUSIE: No, just adjust. I can help you spruce up the B and B, clean things up, you know. Boy, you didn’t waste any time. Mary Margaret’s been in the grave what, not even a day? Don’t try and pull the Mary Margaret card here. -Now, she was a real friend. -Too bad you were too busy to visit her in the hospital or attend the funeral.

You come in here telling me one of my dearest girls is dead, and I’m a little upset. Oh, you know which girl? I pay Rayleen good money for a cut and color and some much needed peace and quiet.

Um... would you mind telling us how long she was using? Not in my department, honey. But it’s not the worst lead. Enid, what about this fella that manages for you? Weirdo, not from Easter Cove.

I’m on break, Officer. Talk to Tanya. Hey, sorry to bother you. You seemed upset at the Oceanview. Were you close with Dee? (sighs) You happen to know where she was from or how she ended up there? Hey, look, I’m just trying to find whoever did this before they can do it to someone else, all right? Yeah, her family’s in Lowell, Mass. But she was living in Lynn when Gorski picked her up. And, uh, Gorski-- did he pick you up, too? Did Dee owe anyone money? People owed her fucking money, guy. What people? -Your fucking mother. -Okay. Please, was there anyone who was upset with her?

ENID: Here we go. -I can help. -Oh, no, no, no. -I’ll get that. -Are you sure? ENID: Ah! I remember these. (laughs) Your mother used to slip a flask in the side and sneak booze out of your granddad’s cabinet. That doesn’t sound like Ma. Ah, she was the worst, your mother. But we never got caught. For anything. A lot of people underestimate young women. That’s why they can get away with a lot. We had a good run, your mother and I. Made a lot of money, too. She was a natural businesswoman. You worked at the fish shop? (chuckling): Do these look like fishmonger hands to you, dear? Uh, given that your mother and I go way back, I want you girls to know that... ...if anything ever happened, you can come to me. I’ve seen it all, and I won’t judge. Connollys. -Oh, thank you. -Thank you. Um, can we have a minute? Sure. PRISCILLA: Enid said she and our mother made a lot of money together. What did she mean by that? What you girls need to understand is that it used to be real bad around here. It’s a small town, but it’s also a port. A lot of men came through. Not all of them were nice. So, when Enid said she wanted to start Oceanview, we all, including your mother, supported her. By starting a whorehouse? By managing the situation. In those days, we said, "Boys will be boys. If it’s not Enid’s girls, then it’s our own daughters." We wanted something better for you kids. GAIL: Awful nerve of Enid, stirring things up with you two. Enid’s dangerous. Stay away from her. (bird cawing) Ah, shit. I forgot we’re out of milk. I just bought some. No, it was bad. I-I threw it out. What do you mean, you threw it out? What, Pris? It had lumps in it. -That’s gross. -Where’s the carton? They can’t just sell us bad milk, Mary Beth. I took it out this morning, Priscilla. Goddamn it! I mean, we’re broke. Who does this to their own daughters? I mean, this is so wrong. That-that we don’t have milk? That she ran a whorehouse. We did everything for her. Made sure she was comfortable, walked her around the house with that fucking pillow, made her goddamn soup. Oh, took her to church for her holiness. And how does she thank us, huh? She leaves us with no savings... -Pris. -...a shitty business, funeral bills, hospital bills -and a house we can’t afford. -Pris. What? (sighing) Someone’s gonna miss this. Yeah. But he’s dead. COLETTI: Well, I think we found out who plowed into old Cap’n Dick. (coughs) -There’s guns in here. -Okay. You sure about that? All right. Yeah, thanks. All right, I got to run. I’ll bet you a Caramel Frappuccino the bullet matches. Yeah, but why would he leave the tarps in the trunk? And-and if you’re gonna skip town, wouldn’t you take the gun with you? Or y-you dump it off somewhere? Either way, all roads lead to Gorski. Yeah, but Enid lied to us about knowing his address. So says Declan. (chuckles) Hey, you know what? I-I don’t understand-- why are you always giving her a free pass? Hey, Agatha Christie, how about you stop telling me how to do my job, huh? (inhales deeply) (exhales) Come in. You can keep me company. Have some if you like. (grunts) -Ow, it’s hot. -Blow on it first. (chuckles) (blowing) ALEXIS: Mm. They’re saying bad things about you. Who’s saying bad things? I don’t know. Some old ladies. What kind of bad things? That Dee... That, um... that maybe you hurt Dee. And do you believe them? No. I mean, I don’t think so. (chuckles) Let me ask you something. Who... who helped you out when you had nothing? No, you did. No, I know, I know. -You did. -(Enid sighs) I... I feel like such a fool. I had no idea Gorski was such a monster. Wait. What... Gorski killed Dee? He’s a sick man. What can I say? I gave him a little bit of authority, and he seemed to take it as a free ticket to do what he wanted. Oh, my God. (gasps) But Dee, honey... she begged me to give her the queen’s treatment. I’m sorry to break it to you, but that girl was ready to sell you down the river at the drop of a hat if it meant she could have -a bigger slice of pie. -No, but Dee and I... -Dee and I were like sisters. -(Enid bangs table) -Come on. -Wake up, cupcake. She was only ever looking out for herself. It was a sad realization for me, too, after all I’d done for her. Enid, you fucking owed her money. Dee was a selfish, ungrateful junkie who was always skimming off the top. Not an ounce of loyalty in that girl. And you know what? I’m still here for you, aren’t I? Come here. (floorboard creaks) Yeah. What are you doing here, anyway? Why aren’t you at The Desert? Declan kicked us out. He said you didn’t pay this month. (birds screeching) (loud bang on hood) Gail and Doreen put you up to this?! Whoa, Enid, calm down. You’re not so pretty when you’re mad. 30 years of business, and I don’t get the benefit of the doubt?! Just pay me what you owe me, and your girls go back to work. (gasps, pants) You scared me. Your mom still hide whiskey around here? Uh, I doubt it. Uh, is there something I could help you with, Mrs. Devlin? Ms. Devlin. (grunts) -(bell jingles) -Hi, Pris. Don’t hate me, but I splurged. ENID: Bingo. Aged to perfection. (clicks tongue) ENID: I was about your age when I inherited the B and B. When some fishermen started bringing this girl to Oceanview for hourly services, I was furious. But your mother had the idea to actually talk to the girl. See if we could all find a way to capitalize. And we did. Go on, drink up. Drink up. You know why I’m here? The sad truth is I’m disappointed in you girls. You thought you could hustle me. Mrs. Devlin, we... -(Enid bangs table) -But because of your mother, I’m giving you a second chance to make this right. You’re going to bring me back what you stole. And I’ll return... that fancy knife of yours. And if you don’t, there are two things I can do. And the nice one is to turn you in. See you tonight. MARY BETH: Pris! Okay, Priscilla, just... wait one minute. Priscilla, just slow down. How does she have the knife if you dropped it off Kernwood Bridge? Well, you were freaking out. You lied to me. I needed to calm you down. -I’m going to the police. -Look. Why don’t we just bring that bitch back her money? You heard Gail. She said stay the hell away. -That girl was killed. -I know. -She worked for Enid, Mary Beth. -I know, but-but... No, if you saw what I saw... Yeah, but that doesn’t mean that... Where’s the money? I’m not a criminal. (stammers) I can’t live like this. So then let’s just leave. We could take this money. It’s $50,000. We could get out of this dump, Pris. This town, this house-- it’s all pathetic. If you leave with that money, I’m done. I mean, really, you’re on your own. No one to clean up your mess. Do you get that if we-we go and we turn ourselves in, then-then our lives are over? (crying): Mary Beth, grow up.

Mary Beth. Officer Brennan. "Officer Brennan" still, eh? Well, better than "sir." I’ll take it. Wow. Smells delish in there. Is that haddock? Geez. Smells good. Sorry, um, stomach’s talking. Oh, uh, did you... (chuckles softly) Would you... Do you want to join us? Uh, yeah. I won’t say no to a good meal. Sure. Thanks. JUSTIN: Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen. All right. I, um... Sorry to hear about your mom. Um, just wanted to say that. Um, funeral was Saturday, yeah? MARY BETH: Mm-hmm. And was everything okay with you two, um... here alone that night? -Uh, well... -PRISCILLA: Everything was fine. We, uh... we went to bed early. Okay. It’s just, uh... (sighs) Sorry. The reason I ask is, uh, the station actually got a call from this residence, um, pretty late on Saturday night, so... Did you girls see anything unusual? Oh. (chuckles) You know, that was me. I-I remember now. I-I pressed the wrong preset. (chuckles softly) How’d you do that? Oh, um... our Uncle Henry got really drunk, and, uh... (chuckles) I just was trying to call to see if he got home okay, and, um, I was trying to press the, uh, assisted living, um, preset. (all chuckle) -Fumbling fingers. -PRISCILLA (laughing): Yeah. -And, uh, w-was he okay? -Oh, yeah. He, uh... I think he got a new girlfriend that night. (all chuckling) Okay. Quite the scoundrel, then, huh? Um, well, so, uh... so, if I had to note it for the, um, official record, you guys were here all Saturday night after the reception? Yeah. We were here together. All night. PRISCILLA: Oh, uh... St. Joan’s soup kitchen. On volunteer day. I do remember you. Well, bye, Justin. Yeah, bye. (sighs) I changed my mind. Well, so what are we gonna do now? (sighs) We give the bitch back her money. -(phone beeps) -DEE (recorded): Hey. What are you doing? (sighs) Lexie. I love you so much. You know that? Wish you’d pick up your phone. I did something, Lexie. I cracked it. It was Enid’s birthday. (Dee laughing) We are done taking shit. October 17... -1951. -(lock clicks) Happy birthday, Enid. (knocking) Come in, sweetheart. Come in. ALEXIS: I know Enid’s lying to me. She hurt my friend. ENID: I’d like another one for the road. BARTENDER: Enid, I think you’ve had enough for tonight. Why don’t you get yourself home? (laughing, slurring): Isn’t that... isn’t-isn’t that cute? Cut the shit and get to pouring. ♪ Unlucky at love and life... ♪ JUSTIN: The older one, Priscilla? -PAULIE: Mm-hmm? -Her hair is different, but it’s... yeah, she’s just... she’s still really pretty. Work that uniform. The Catholic girls love that shit. You know her younger sister. What about her? Oh, she’s a hot shit, but a waste of time. She likes the creeps. -Yeah? -Yeah. I don’t get that. Why do girls like dicks? Oh, not even just a dick; like, a dirtbag. She was all over that Oceanview creeper in here the other night. ♪ I can’t stop hurtin’ myself... ♪ Paulie, what, uh... what night was that? It was, uh, Saturday. -Saturday, huh? -Yeah. Well, shit. (tires squealing) (wind whistling) (car door opens, closes) (sighs) I need this like a hole in the head. DOREEN: We know you killed that girl, Enid. GAIL: You need to turn yourself in. SUSIE: We want to help you. Y-You’re like family. ENID: Cut the bullshit, Suze. You hens decided to hate me years ago. You didn’t play by the rules, Enid. That’s right. I didn’t have a kid to parade around or a cake at the goddamn bake sale. Not those kind of rules, Enid. What, this? This place we all decided on together, that we all said yes to? -You convinced us then. -Bullshit. We all remember how bad it was. We all have stories, so... don’t treat me like I was asking for trouble. GAIL: It changed, Enid. -The whole operation. -Admit it, Gail. You never had a problem with this place until you caught Bruce coming by. Maybe. But you, Enid... you need to take a good look in the mirror. The devil herself. SUSIE: It-it’s not right, Enid. They’re not our girls, but they’re somebody’s daughters. GAIL: That poor thing didn’t deserve to die. ENID: Dee? You all used her. You all benefited from her and so many others. And God knows how we can ever forgive ourselves. But we’re trying to do right now. DOREEN: It’s over, Enid. If you can’t see that, we can’t help you. (wind whistling) Toodle-oo. Catty bitches. (door creaks open) (door closes) (footsteps approaching) We’ll take the back door. And the boat. (engine starts) (door creaks) (door closes) Mrs. Devlin? (indistinct whispering) Um, Mrs. Devlin? -(TV playing indistinctly) -(floorboards creaking) WOMAN (over TV): ...saying, um, "Danielle’s mom sold me an effin’ fake ticket," and she’s, like, going on and on with all these inappropriate texts. WOMAN 2: Let-let me ask you something. (TV chatter continues indistinctly) PRISCILLA: Here’s the money. MARY BETH: We had to use some, but, uh, we’ll pay you back. We swear. WOMAN (over TV): And I was like, "My mom’s here. She can go get your ticket..." (whispers): God, I miss your mother. I never said goodbye. I’m sure she hated me. She wasn’t angry. I think she understood. (chuckling): She was a good egg, your mother. Did everything for you girls. Left the business ’cause of you. I don’t hold it against you, though. MARY BETH: Well, we won’t be bothering you from now on. Tell that to Gorski. (snoring) We’d like our knife back. Hmm? Oh, yeah. The knife. (sighs) (drops knife, closes drawer) On second thought, I think you should keep some of this money. I know you need it. Buy a f-few nice things. Wouldn’t hurt. And when that money’s gone, you can come to work for me. On the business side, of course. We can’t accept this. Don’t be stupid. Pris is right. We don’t want your money. -(smack) -(gasps) I don’t like your tone. You brats have no idea how easy you have it. We were on our own. No one was looking out for us. But you girls, you grew up spoiled fucking rotten! And now you want to act all high and mighty? Look down on me? Judge me? Judge my life? -Mrs. Devlin... -Ms. Devlin! You should be on your knees thanking me! -(groaning) -(Priscilla gasps) (Enid sobbing quietly) -(exhales sharply) -Here. (quietly): Yeah. I can’t. Stop it. (sighing) We’re taking our knife back, Ms. Devlin.

(birds screeching) MARY BETH: I guess now it’s time we got to get back to work. Pris, I figure, if we bust our asses, we could probably keep the house. The house is just a house.
