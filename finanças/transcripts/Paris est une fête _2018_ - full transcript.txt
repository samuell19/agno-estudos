NETFLIX PRESENTS Recognize me? Do you remember me? I'm Cyrille's friend. Oh, right! How are you? - Good. You? - Good. - What's your name? - What? - What's your name? - Anna. - You? - Greg. - Oh yeah, right. How are you? - I'm good. - Are you alone? - Yeah. I've been trying to call my friends. I don't know where they are. Jeez, I'm coming up. Yeah, me too. I couldn't tell. Can I touch your hair? It's soft. Not like mine. It's strong. What is? Us? I've never felt anything like it. Are you sure it's real? Maybe we're going to wake up apart and we'll never meet. Let's tell each other everything. All the things we never told anyone. Like what? I don't know. What were you like as a child? When I was a child, I imagined that when I closed my eyes, the people around me didn't exist anymore. They were there because I was there to see them. It was like life was a big game and I was the main protagonist. And so the day I would die, everything would disappear. The entire world would disappear. I was a little crazy. Not at all, keep talking. I grew up in the countryside. I think I was kind of bored. When we couldn't watch TV, my sister and I would go outside and look at the planes in the sky. When two planes crossed, it drew a big X. I was convinced it was a sign. I always thought: "Something is going to happen." I was hoping something bad would happen, that all the planes would fall out of the sky. I wanted it to create something, so I would finally feel... alive. Stop smoking! You smoke way too much! You smoke more than me, now. Thanks. A year ago, you just took a couple of drags on my cigarettes. Don't tell me what to do! - You used to be a social smoker. - Don't tell me... Do you realize that you're always telling me what to do? I didn't force you to go out. No, but I did it for you. I'm beat, I don't want to go out on Sundays. - Go home, then. - But we're having a good time. We're having a great time, it's awesome. Look at people, running after their boredom. It's the trip of the year. - Listen to yourself! - What? Of course, there's shitty music. Of course. - As if it wasn't enough. - What? As if the music wasn't bad enough as it is, people feel the need to play their shit. Because you're a great musician. We drink red wine, we wear a beret and we pose as musicians by the canal. Some people have imagination and some others don't. Some people are clueless and others are a little less clueless. And what side are you on? A little less clueless. Ideally, I'd like to get Barcelona. If they said yes, I would be thrilled. Wait. And when were you planning on telling me? I don't know, I guess I was waiting for the answer. I am waiting. So you were going to tell me once my back is against the wall? Against the wall? Do you think I want to go to Barcelona? Why wouldn't you? Why would I? I don't know, the sun, the nice weather... We want to buy a place. We're not going to buy a shitty place in Paris, when we could buy a house at the beach. So you don't think about me at all. You do your thing, with your job, your money, your place, your apartment, and I don't exist. You don't exist? What are you talking about? Do you think I want to go to Spain? How would I know? You don't want to do anything. I want to do a lot of things. Like serving coffee, great! Wait... What did you just say? - What? - What did you say? - Do you like serving coffee? - Yes! What about your physio degree? I'm going to get it. You've been saying this for two years! You don't believe in me! You don't want to support me! You just want to get out of Paris, without me. You know what? Just go the fuck alone! But who said "without you"? What's wrong with you? Calm down! Did you see how you just flipped out on me? I'm just talking about work and... You always talk about what you want to do! You! You! It's always about you! Wait a second... "I want to go to Barcelona, I want to make money..." - What about me? - And who pays rent? Oh, you pay rent, so you're the only one who matters? I'm sorry, but who brings in the money? I do, so... - It's all about money. - What? It's all about money. What else is there? What else is there? - Well there's... - What? What? There's you and me. What's the main problem? All you want is to make money? - Honestly, yes. - Come talk to me. Yes, yes. So what? - So your main concern is money? - Yes, I wanna make money. Then do it alone. I know you by heart, you could never stand being alone. Thank you. How do you think we will be in the future? What if we didn't care? What if we drift apart? What will happen then? I don't know. It would be stupid. Give me your hand. Are you afraid of what is going to happen next? Don't you want to do something with your life? Find a job, stop running and getting lost! And you show up, as if nothing happened. I already told him, but... He thinks we should live somewhere else. I know... It's starting. I'll call you later. It's OK. What? It hurts? What? Stop... You live... a rather... quiet life. I mean normal. You keep saying "normal", but I don't know what you mean. You have friends, a career plan, you get along with your family. Are you telling me I'm basic? No. I like it. No one loved you? I find it hard to believe. No, no, no! Stop! I'm gonna fall! I want you to come with me. Come with me. Just for a few days, come. - I don't have a choice, you're leaving. - So, come! I don't want you to leave. What keeps you in Paris? Once I have an apartment, come visit me in Barcelona. Why would I do that? I find a place, you come and if you don't like it, I'll quit. - It'll be good for us. - Why? I don't know. It could be a fresh start for both of us. Last night, I dreamt of the day we met. - I don't think it was luck. - You're talking about the party? We have something unique, we can't throw it away. We never pretended. It can't stop now, not now! I'm begging you, get on that plane. I love you. I said too much, didn't I? I'm just looking at you. Your turn. My sister and I got older and she played The Sims. I would spend hours watching her. She said it was like the life of real people, but inside a video game. I used to think: "Maybe we are Sims characters, but we don't know it." - Don't make fun of me. - I promise. Did you ever think that Paris, our lives, or even the entire universe, could be a huge video game? As if reality, I mean our experience of reality, was a virtual world, a computer program. This program might even be launched from a space outside of our world, outside of time. And so our lives, but maybe all of this too, this city, would be a virtual world built by an intelligence far more superior to ours. Look at all these people. Don't you think their lives are written somewhere? I'm sure they know it. It's as if we were both living in a big dream, somewhere in a data center, someone else's big dream, a dream that could repeat itself indefinitely. Everything would then be possible. There might even be life after death. Don't you think? It would explain so much! Everything that happens and that we can't understand. It would be so much better, so much better if all of this didn't actually exist. Look. Look around us. Isn't everything too perfect here for it to be an accident? Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. You're here! I've been looking all over for you. - I tried to call you. - My phone died. - You'll never guess what. - What? A plane just crashed. - Really? - Yes. It was going to Barcelona. I thought it was yours. - You could have been on it. - What? - You could have been on it. - Yeah. Anna, what are you doing? What's wrong? It looks like you don't care. I do care, but we have to go. Did you at least call Greg? It's serious, I'll call him. - Put your phone down. - Call him! Put your phone down! Come on, give it to me! - Stop! - What's wrong with you? - Give me my phone back! - Here. - You're not gonna do it. - I'll call him later. - Why are you being like this? - Come on, let's go! What the hell is your problem? Are you gonna cry? The race is over there! - I don't want to go. - You don't? - I'm not gonna run! - Then give me your number! Don't be stupid! You could have died and all you think about is running. Give me your number. Give it! If you don't want to run, I will! And stop sulking! - Are you OK? - Yes. Thank you. He won't stop running. Tell me. - What do you want me to say? - What you're feeling. About what? You don't feel anything? That's when I say "I love you", is that it? No. - No, I'm serious. - Then what? Tell me what you're feeling. So you're telling me that... That you're fulfilled. Compared to you, very. You compare us to each other, you draw scales... You grade us at night: "I get an A in personal fulfillment. You get an F, because you don't work and you're not climbing the social ladder!" I mean... Yes, sure, whatever. The only problem is that I don't have any money. No, the problem is that you don't have any ambition. But I'm not saying this to be mean. I didn't have ambition with you. Remember the first few months, I didn't really like it, I thought I didn't have enough responsibilities... Yes, I remember. - Well I hung in there. - You were not happy. - Sorry? - You were not happy. - No, I wasn't. - You really weren't. Anyway, I hung in there and look at me today... - I'm not talking about today. - What you have accomplished. No, but look how quickly I managed to advance at work and reach a place where I'm happy and I make good money. But I don't want to be an American self-made woman. That's not what I'm saying! I don't want to build five-star hotels. But I'm not asking you to do that. I know, but it's the idea. But it's not about the idea. My idea is to tell you... I don't necessarily want to climb the rungs. You're drowning. - I'm not drowning, I'm floating. - Yeah, away. Same difference. No, I... I'm just not climbing the ladder like you are. You're not even on the ladder, you're next to it. Yes, you're right. But it's all good. Doesn't it feel like we're a foreign couple in Paris for the first time? Hello! How are you? - A word? - Yes, please. Fantastic! We are The Red Noses. - Do you know us? - Yes. We play guitar, we do magic tricks... If you're volunteers, it's not gonna sit right with Greg, because making money is important to him. He keeps nagging me. I have a lot of contacts, because I travel a lot. Come. I'm serious. For example, a dad, not that long ago... I took care of his kid and he told me: "What you do is amazing, dude! I have a production company." You see? Come see us, dude. It's a win-win. You don't have to fake it. I know you want to cry. Look at this crowd. [French president] A plane just crashed... - Can I get my phone back? - Sure. Thanks. - There you go. - Thank you. ...the city of Paris and the city of Barcelona. 148 people were on board. The conditions of the crash, which have not yet been clarified, lead us to think that there are no survivors. The victims have not yet been identified. It is a tragedy, a loss we have to suffer through. The Home Secretary, Bernard Cazeneuve, is on his way as we speak, an emergency committee has just been created and we will have all the information in a few minutes. The country is mourning. The families are grieving and hurting. I made sure that every measure is reinforced to the highest level, even if grief is assailing us. There is indeed something to be scared of, but there is, in front of terror, a nation which rallies its strengths. France must be strong... I'm sorry. It's my fault. I should not have told you to come. I'm so happy to have you back. I'm so happy to see you! - I love you - Me too. It's almost impossible for a plane... I'd rather not talk about it. We'll know when they find the black box. It's none of my business. I just want to stop fighting, I want us to be in love again. I want that too. - Who are we? - The Sentier team! Thank you! That's it! Thank you for coming! It's normal for him. He doesn't see the problem. He comes back as if nothing happened, without discussing it. Because of this plane thing, he thinks there's no problem anymore. You know what I mean? He wants to start over. - My feelings don't count. - Yes, they do. He left and now he is expecting everything to be forgotten. - If I... - Do you still love him? I think so, but I don't know what I want. - Go, go, go, go! - If you... Sir, did you see that? She attacked me! You're insane! OK, fine. It's just that... I don't know... I would like things to go back to the way they were. Alright, got it. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Anna. What's your name? Nice to meet you. I'm Greg. And what do you do? Nothing, I'm just finishing school. And? And I'm bored. Really? You should have said so! I'm not bored at all! - Want to kiss for the first time? - Sure. One, two, three. A guy walks toward a girl who is alone in the crowd. They walk outside. He kisses her. The air is blue. It's their first moments. There is just enough softness and lightness to be confident. The miracle of the encounter. She tells him things she would've normally kept to herself. She tells him what they will experience if he keeps kissing her, what will happen between them, what is inevitable. She knows love is just a state, a passing zone. And she knows that after love, all that is left is a cloud of smoke, a trace evaporating and stretching across the sky, like the planes floating over her childhood house, as if nothing had changed since she was little and hoping to see them crash into a cloud of smoke. Hello! She was ready to forget the world, to become someone else. She knows they will always go back to that moment, to that encounter, like you go back to your childhood before you die. Don't you think that you... That you could... make the most of what happened, see it as a good thing, a wake-up call, as something positive that sends you on a new path? I don't know. What happened to you is amazing! I mean you're alive! You could have died, like anyone, like billions of people who died, but you're here. Don't you think it's a chance? You're going to say I'm ambitious, but I have great plans for us. We can finally be what we have always wanted to be. We can do anything. We just have to go for it. We could be moving into an apartment tomorrow and do whatever we want. You just need to stop being afraid and letting yourself sink into doubt or in whatever makes you being in your head. I AM CHARLIE I AM HERE Come on, fucking say something! I don't know. What do you want me to say? Why are you like that? What do you mean? - You've changed! - No, I haven't. Come here. Come here! I am cold. I don't talk, because you get upset. Fuck! See how you... See how you're getting upset? Calm down. Come. Come. What did I do? Come on! Come on, talk to me! Tell me why. Fucking talk to me! Why did you change? How is it possible? How did I change? We know each other, we tell each other everything. And I'm telling you, nothing's changed. I'm telling you everything. Everything's fine! I have stuff in my head, that might not concern you. All that is left is a black hole, ready to swallow them. He was like a childhood memory she was keeping. His presence was mysterious, inexplicable, a part of her that was slowly fading. That's what she must have been thinking. That's what she must have been thinking now. Everything is going faster, like a centrifugal force around her that nothing can stop. She should have asked herself earlier what was real, true. She should have rebelled against her destiny which was written in an unread sacred book. She should have asked herself if she had really met Greg on that hot July night. Now, everything is a blur, everything is muddled. She didn't know if she had loved him, if she had been tied to him. It was over, she was in her head. Planes were flying by, too low, too fast. In this whirlwind, she was hearing her own voice, that voice that didn't want to speak, hear, or exist. "I'm cold, hold me tighter!" What was it? A dream? Was that really the runway in the distance? Was this place safe? Am I safe here? Everything was tumbling inside her head. Those thoughts could not come from her. What is left after the miracle of the encounter? Is life just about supply and demand? We can't live like that. We will tip the world over into the trash of history. We need more. We need magic, desire. Something must hold between you and I. It is our childhood. She didn't understand. She still had that feeling she had when she was little, in front of that video game. Why? Because everything is predictable. The weather, the elections, people's reactions to commercials, when they are going to cry at the movies, the economy, the stars' trajectory, the time it will take us to destroy this incomprehensible planet I am running on. Is it my fault? I imagined the end of our story since the beginning. I imagined the end of our story like a beginning. If only that thing could have held between you and I, if only the world didn't come between you and I. Is it really my fault? Something is broken. Something is irreparable around us. I was waiting for the accident. Now that it's here, I'm even emptier. I'm afraid of what is going to happen in this world. The more I try to be myself, the emptier I am. I am completely empty, as barren and sad as a mall at midnight. I want the plane to find a strip and land, I want it out, I don't want to be scared. Nothing is holding between you and I. I don't want there to be any accident. I'm alone, and alone, I don't have any control. Something terrible is about to happen. I want us all to fall at the same time. I want us to stop pretending. I want to stay out of events. I don't want to look at myself, I don't want to move. I want to stay out of everything. I want everything to stop now! I don't want to talk about myself. I want the world to go through me. Don't hold me back! Leave me alone, let me be sad. I want tears! When you leave, I'll become someone else. I can be someone else. Leave me alone. I want it all to stop now. Leave me alone! You don't come to a cemetery to exercise. Let me help you. They are all here. With us. The ones we loved, the ones that are gone, the ones we will see again or not. I came to put flowers on my daughter's grave. She died a few years ago. I spent seven years in a cell. It was called "the submarine". It was dark. The sun never came in. And then one day, they put me in a cell on a higher floor. It is an incredible sight, to see the sun set, when you have forgotten what it looks like. I am not a sensitive person, but my eyes were wet. And then they put me back in the submarine. But something had changed in me. Not long after that, my daughter died. Take them. You can keep them. Take them. There is something... about you. Something... I don't know how to say it. I never know how to say it. But I see something special in you. As if you were sort of... outside of everything. [French president] This Saturday of December is a sad day. And you are here. Still here. Always here. It is also a day of intimate pain. I know that many of you, for a few days now, have been discovering a strange solitude. It was life, life in its sovereignty, its magnificence, its generosity. And it was a part of ourselves. It was a part of France. That is also why we are gathered here today, that is also why I am speaking before you. For we are a nation that speaks its gratitude, for we are a united people. He lasted through time, eras, generations and everything that divides society. And at every moment, there was this indefinable humanity that sees right through you and makes you feel less lonely. The emotion that brings us here today is just like him. It doesn't cheat, it doesn't pose, it sweeps everything along. It is one of those energies that make up a people, a force that moves forward. I wish you could hear me, understand me. I heard their speeches. Their words lead the world astray. On the one hand, there's what they say, that isn't real, and on the other, what we experience, but can't express. A distorting line separates me from the world. It's like I'm in a big room divided by a curtain. On my side, I can only see the world through images, nightmarish images. Even if I know that on the other side, there is life, reality, I can't cross through. I stay on the wrong side. Those horrible images are haunting me, inhabiting me. This hatred, this fear, this suppression, and the resignation of our generation who knows it won't change the world. This outside is here, inside of me, everywhere. I can't extract this outside world from me. I am all of this, everything I see outside that I can't stand, that's who I am. That's who I am now. I am all of this. This fear of losing it all, that everything is going to crumble down, I am all of this now. I am everything I see outside but can't stand. That's not what I want to be. I can't look at it as an external element, it's what I am. I am all of it. If it all goes down, I go down too. If I want to destroy it all, I have to destroy myself, walk past that curtain, take those few steps, because... No, it hasn't always been like this. When we were little, we used to lie under the trees and look at the leaves blown by the wind. We were just there. I know that deep down, we share the same things. We are all penetrated by much more beautiful things that tie us to the world. Songs, encounters, looks, loves, stories, ancestors, memories. All the things that constitute us but that we don't see. We should all be there again. We want to feel something powerful so bad, something intense, a moment that would hold all the others. As if we had never really lived before that. Everything is here, in this whole night, in this split second. What can happen to us? What stops us from reuniting? I saw the end of our story. I saw this moment escape, without being able to hold it back. I saw it pass me by, like you watch the train you missed from the platform. I felt birth and death. Night falls upon the world. Night strikes. It slips through our fingers. It's what we are. We are not to blame. The world around us is, all the things we will never change, what we are now. That's all we know. There is nothing more to know. No, wait. I'm afraid it will start all over again. Even if this life is just a dream, even if this city stands between us, even if the night surrounds us, now is when it's all possible. Just now. Even if this world is like a crashing plane, even if its fall is long, it is urgent to try things, to believe it's possible, it is urgent to change the course of the fall. Even if we're hanging in thin air, even if the impact is inevitable, something must hold between you and I. And if everything crumbles, if the plane hits the ground in a second, we will keep the world in us. We will keep that night like the moment that contains it all. And if everything crumbles, we will start a fire and warm ourselves with the remains of their world. It will be our light. Even if everything crumbles. Recognize me? Do you remember me? I'm Cyrille's friend. Oh, right! How are you? - Good. You? - Good. - What's your name? - Anna. Subtitles: Marianne Henry-Réville
