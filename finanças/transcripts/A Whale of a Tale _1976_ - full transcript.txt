It's back to school before I know and my summer all behind and it's no fun to be alone when the sun is going down. Dear god if you're listening, won't you send some one around. I'm looking for a friend. I'm looking for a friend. Friend. I'm looking for a friend. I'm looking for a friend. I'm looking for a friend. I'm looking for a friend. Hi. Hi kid.

All the fishes and I catch all of them. I told you. Did you see the whale? Yeah, like them huh? Who catches the fish? I catch the fish because I'm the greatest fisherman in the whole world. Maybe in America. Did you catch the whale? Yeah, I caught the whale. Hi Louie. Hi Frank! Hey! You kid! Hello there folks. This is your diver speaking. From the bottom of the tank right in front of you. I am starting to feed some of the fish here and they know it's feeding time. Watch them gather around. We have thousands of fish in this tank and over several hundred varieties. There are Garibaldi and here comes a turtle. There are sand sharks over there. He's a shy fellow. And we have a giant bat ray. Watch him g Hey kid! Come here! Hi Louie! Hi! Thank you. There's your fish Louie. I'll see you.pp How did you get back in here again? Can I help you unload the truck? Why do you keep coming back in here? You're gonna get in trouble. I want to get a job here. I want to be like you. Like me? I want to work here at Marine Land. I want to be a trainer. I like fish and they like me. So, you want a job huh? Well, let's see what I can do. Are you s Look. Look. Feel that muscle! Hey, that's pretty good. You're strong. Real strong. Louie, who's your new helper? He's my friend Joey. He wants to work here. Do you think we can get him a job? We get applicants from all over the world. It takes a great deal of training to work here. You're kind of short, aren't yah? Might as well do it Doc. Give him a job. Because we keep throwing him out of here and he keeps coming back in. Oh, you're the one they talk about. You keep sneaking in. We keep kicking you out and you keep sneaking back in. OK, you want a job? Alright, we'll put you to work and if you can handle it, we'll see about a steady job. You really mean it? I can work here? Sure. Sure, I'll tell you what. Take this fish into the shed. It's a lot of heavy work for a strong young man. Louie, I tell you what. We'll work him so hard for the next two or three hours. He'll get sick of this place and won't want to see it again. I'm not so sure about that Doc. Anyone that wants to work that bad maybe he'll do it. He wants to be a trainer. H You're the best darn fisherman I know.PP In America anyway. There he is. Go on girl. Let's go. Come on. Go! I got a new trainer for you. Send him out for buckets of fish. He knows where to go. He'll get you all the fish you need. Bob, the kid's been a pest to security. I figure if we work him as hard as we can, he'll get so sick of the place he'll never want to come back. You under up here that he'll never want to see another fish as long as he lives. He young fella. Stand back over here now. What's your na Joseph. They call me Joey. Can I pet him? There's one thing that you got to understand around here Joey. All these animals and fish are potentially dangerous. They don't know you. You don't know them. So, one of the rules around here is that you don't go near any of the animals in any of the tanks unless you are accompanied by some one in charge, understand? He doesn't look very dangerous. Oh you don't think so? Come here. Come on. Come one. that's it. Wow, what big teeth! We never had an accident here at Marine Land Joey and the reason for that is we're careful, even with the animals that know us. Oh, they wouldn't mean to hurt us, but that whale weighs several tons and if he were to clunk you against the side of the tank, or you were to fall in and he was to give you a little playful nudge...well, it would be the equivalent of being hit by a truck. So, we just don't take any chances OK? OK, now you go back down to Louie and you bring up some more fish up here, OK? Come on. Come on. Come one. That's it! That's it. Ladies and gentlemen, our next production in fifteen minutes will be the single dolphin show at the sea arena. The sea arena is located in the...

You're not going to get rid of him that easy. He likes it around here. See you later doc. Come on. Looking good. The two new ones are going to work out f Yeah, they are getting the routines faster than I thought. Have they been tested for intelligence q than the others we got though. You think that they're much higher on the scale than some of the other animals we brought in? Could be. Let's put them to the test and find out. I don't know. How would you like an assistant to help you with the traini Hi, I'm Joey. So you want to be a trainer? Yes sir. We could sure use more good men in this That's why I want to be here. Hey listen Joey.

Joey come here. I got something I want to show you. Something I think you'll be very interes it? Wait and see. Let's just say it's a big surprise. Now come on. Come on! What do you mean a big surprise? You just wait and see. Ah hello Doc. Just the man I'm looking for. Mr. Monahan, I would like you to meet Joey. Joey, this is Mr. Monahan, the real boss. He's the man that really runs this place. Hello Joey. You know, when he gives me a build up like that I know he wants something. Glad to meet you Mr. Monahan. It's nice to be working for you. Working for me? Oh yeah, I was going to explain about th Yeah, I know you will. You come up to the office later and by the way. I want to report on that dolphin rescue project. Davey wants to know how it's coming alon It's nice meeting you Joey. Keep up the good work. I'll see you later Doc. So long. Is he the man that hired me? Well... Did you know that killer whales have been known to tear through ice to get at seals? Polar bears. I thought sharks were the most dangerous things in the ocean. No, no, I would say killer whales because of their enormous size and strength. Plus a pretty good set of teeth. That rates them as the most ferocious killer in the ocean. They've been known to attack everything. Polar bears, men in boats. The eskimos used to go hunting in their kyaks in the skin boats and they would hunt anything except the killer whale. The killer whale was too much for them t Can you really train them here? I mean, they're really contained so they're not wild animal is potentially dangerous and they're not tame. They're trained. They're not tame in the sense that your dog and cat is tame. Now you remember that. That's the biggest fish I ever saw. I bet that's the biggest fish anybody ever caught. It's a mammal Joey. Not a fish. It's a mammal. It just happened to live in the ocean. they breathe air just like you and I do. They don't have gills like a fish. Are you telling the truth? You're kidding. No, no, that's the truth. They could drown if they didn't come up for air and breathe. They are like all the rest of the animals. Seals, walruses, porpoises...they're air breathers. They're not fish. We'd better back out of the way. We'll get hit in the head by a sling. I think you're gonna like it here. Hey kid, I don't think he understands you. Oh sure he does. Animals understand you if you talk to them nice. One of the trainers told me that if you feed the animals and talk to them, they get to know you and then they know that you're feeding them and taking care of them. Then they touch. OK, but I don't care what you say, look at those teeth! He ain't never gonna be friendly! Not to Louie and I ain't gonna give him Well, it works. They told me it works. I bet I can make friends with that whale if I feed him every day and I'm nice to him. I'll bet you he likes me. You ever hear of Moby Dick, the white whale? He bit off Captain Ahab's let and it was a whale just like that. So, you think about that or you'll be walking around like Captain Ahab, with a peg leg. Alright, a Big Mac, fries and what to drink? A Coke please. Great. One Big Mac, fries and a Coke! I got to hurry. I'm on my lunch hour from work. Where do you work? Marine Land. I'm an assistant trainer. Really? Assistant trainer? Kind of. I help with the animals, and I feed them. Here's your order. Was that fast enough for you? Here's your change. Now, you come back again, OK? Oh, and good luck on your job. Thanks. Bye. Hi fella. No, this is my lunch. Besides, who ever heard of a whale eating french fries? I don't eat your fish. You don't So long. I got to get to work. See you later. They said I can work there and now put the fish in the animals. I think that's wonderful darling. Now, why don't you go wash up for dinner? I told you about going all the way down Mom, it's OK with you. Now go get washed up and quit bothering your mother. Go on! Get! Smells just like fish. He must have roll Meg, boys will be Boys! I know. I worry about Joey. I am totally responsible for him when you're at the office and how can I teach that boy proper manners if you kee you make it very difficult for him Meg. Well, now, do you know what I have to put up with. You're gone all day and since we've moved down here near that place, the minute I turn my back, h I appreciate you looking after Joey for me while I'm work, but you have to understand, he's just a little boy.pp a little boy and that's why he needs a man around the house, a father. That's why he keeps sneaking off to Mari Help wanted male. A little boy needs a father. Reasonably attractive. Widow included. ( And, it isn't funny. No it isn't. I'm just doing the best I can. And I'm trying to help you. Let me see your hands. Joey, Joey dear. We feel that maybe you're a little too young to be working down there. I mean, with all those wild animals and everything. I mean, your aunt Meg has enough to worry about as it is. You're already said it was OK. I know. I guess I just wasn't thinking. But your aunt Meg is right. You mean, I can't go back anymore? Well, I tell you what. Maybe when you're older Ah mom. Well, that's that. I'd better get the dinner on. Hi Joey! Where's Louie? Oh, the last time I saw him, he was down Is he going out for fish? Yeah, I did hear somebody say that they were going out on some kind of expedition for some new specimens. Hey, where you going? Hi fella. How you getting along? Sorry, I don't have anything for you. Well, I guess I won't be seeing you for a while. Goodbye. Hey Joey, how are you? You got to work early. I'll get the boat ready. We're going fishing. That's nice. Hey, what's the matter? My mother says I can't work here anymore. It's all on account of my aunt. Oh that's bad. My aunt Meg says it's dangerous. She says I'll get hurt. I wish somebody could talk to my mother about it. Why don't we get Doc to talk to your mother. He'll tell her it's alright. We'll take care of you. I'm sure it'll be OK. You really think he'll talk to my mom? Sure. If I ask him to. Come on. Let's go. That was great. There you go. Stay right there. OK. Now, Hey Doc. Hi. Doc, our friend needs help. What's the matter Joey? Dr. Fredericks, it's my aunt Meg. Well, if your aunt Meg isn't feeling well, I don't think a marine biologist can help. Wouldn't hurt, but couldn't help. I treat animals...fish, not people. No, Doc. She's not sick. She's mad. She doesn't want Joey to work here. She's afraid he' That's what I told my mom. Dr. Fredericks, would you talk to my mother on the telephone? Joey, I don't know about my persuasive over women, but for you, I'll do it. That's great! She's at work and I know the number. Alright, I'll call. What's the number? Press 51200. Uh give me 51200 please. Yeah, what do I ask for? What's her name Anne, Mrs. Anne Fields. Mrs. Anne Fields please. I don't know if this is going to work Jo Want I should talk to her doc? Uh, no, it's OK Louie. I'll give it a try. Ah, Mrs. Fields, this is Dr. Fredericks from Marine Land. It's about Joey. No, no. He's fine. It's just that he came down and he told us that you told him he couldn't work here anymore because you were afraid he would get hurt. Well, I'll tell you what Mrs. Fields. Why don't you come down here and take a tour of the facility. I'll show you around and you can make up your own mind. Great! Uh, lunch time will be fine. Thank you Mrs. Fields. What did she say? Well she said she'd come down on her lun Great! Show her around and explain how very very careful we are and that's all I can do Joey. That's great Doc! You really did great! You'll convince her. I know you will! Come on Louie, let's go to work! OK, let's go Joey. Hey Louie, I'm going over and feeding th OK, but be careful. It's OK. He's my friend. See you later Joey. Hi. I guess you can't see. Did you miss me? Nobody takes care of you like I do. You know, I bet you are going to be the It's funny. Everybody got to go to school. I guess, to learn, even you. Well, I guess it ain't so bad, but I'd rather be here than in the school room. Well, that's enough. I got to go over to the seals and feed them. Bye. People say you're kind of shy but you only talk to those that look right in your eyes. and now I realize they don't know you like I do. They got you figured out all wrong It's just a silly game you play. I've seen it all along. You just put them on. They don't know you like I do. Be careful about who you call your friends where there were good guys, there were bad guys around the ben, but never get close to hurting you yeah. Because you're just like me. We will storm and see it through. They got you figured out all wrong it's just a silly game. I've seen it all along. They don't know you like I do. Just don't know you like I do. Good morning Ma'am.

Can I show you ar Thank you. These fish are really quite delicate. We have to be very careful about the chemical content and the temperature. One slight mistake and we could lose thousands of dollars of expensive fish. I didn't realize there was so much involved with just hav than an aquarium. I think you're pampering them. Well, we try. Come on, I'll show you where Joey's working. One of our big buddies. That's a killer whale, isn't it? That's the strangest barking. You got to admit that nature did an unusual job. It doesn't even look real. Oh, it's real. It looks like one of those rubber animals that they use in parades. Oh yeah, it's become quite tame. Handling it's come around. It's going to be one of our star performers. Bob, where's Joey? He and Louie are over at the seal arena. Well, let's go see what's going on at the seal arena.

Oh, then why did you drag it all the way home? There are holes all over it. It happened at the boat. What boat? Where we caught the sharks. Now, young man you tell me everything that happened tod I went out on the boat with Louie. Louie? The best darn fisherman in the whole world. Well, in America anyway. Oh, alright, I believe you. Now go on. Well, we went out on the boat for sharks Did you catch any? Boy did we. One great big one bit right through this bucket on the deck. When we were trying to take him in the tank, well he broke off a tooth and I got it right here. No, don't show it to me. You get upstairs and get washed. You wait until your mother gets home and I tell her about everything that happened today. Now give me that thing. That's mine! Now get upstairs. I don't want anymore foolishness and I mean it. Oh shoot. Good lord. I think we can afford a new one. I've had too many shocks already today. Obviously. What's with the bucket. This was your son almost. Now that you're going to have to explain. Well, ask him. Now, tell your mother how you could have got killed today. Ah, it was nothing. Alright Joey, what happened today? I went out on the boat and I went fishing. Sharks. For what?! Sharks. And one of those man eaters just bit a hole in this poor little bucket. Is that true? Yeah, one of them bit that dumb bucket. Good lord. Joey, when you went to work out there at Marine Land. You promised me that you weren't going to do anything dangerous. Well. Well, to tell the truth, I didn't really catch any sharks. Louie made me go up in the bridge and wait in the wheelhouse until they got the sharks in the tank.PP Are you telling the whole truth? Yes, aunt Meg. Alright. Alright, but I'm going to have a talk with that Dr. Fredericks. Ah mom. Now that's enough of it. You get in and set the table. Now I know what you're going to say. Well, what are you going to do about it? Well, I'm going to go out to Marine Land and I'm going to have a talk with Dr. Fredericks. What does he look like? Not bad. A family man? No. As a matter of fact, he's not married. He isn't. Well that's what he told me. Well, I wonder why he told you that. Now look Meg. Don't go getting any ideas. Morning. Hey good morning. Getting an early start aren't you Joey? I got a new whale. Morning fella. Miss me? Boy, I bet you never had anyone tell you what you couldn't do. Especially an aunt. I guess you don't have many friends because most people are afraid of you. They don't know you like I do. What's the matter? Your tongue itch? How's that? Better? OK. Good of you. Here's another fish. OK. Time to prep the act. Come on. Do good. Good boy! Wave bye-bye. I gotta go to work. Hi Louie! How's the baby whale doing? Hi Joey, he's fine. He's going to be OK. Hey did you know that Dr. Fredericks is looking for you? He wants you up in the lab. Really? Yeah. Where have you been? I was over with the new whale. He and I are good friends. I told you to stay away from that killer whale. He's no good. Nah, we're pals. I pat his head and scratch his tongue. Listen, if I see you around that dangerous whale again, I'll pat your head and scratch your tongue. Now, you get up to Dr. Fredericks up in the lab, right away. OK. See you later Louie. OK, Joey. Hi Joey. I got something here that I think you might be interested in. You know what that is? Looks like an octopus made out of ice.pp That's exactly what it is, or almost. It's an octopus and it's been chilled with ice. That's how they ship t No, no...he's very much alive and we're gonna bring him back. We're going to wake him up. I thought you might like to help. How do I do that? I'll show you. First of all, we put him in this tank here. and we work him up to where he starts breathing again. See. Massage him like that. Here, grab a hold. As soon as he starts to breathe, he will come back. Come here. Grab a hold. That's it. Come on. Don't be afraid. If you're going to be a marine biologist, you got to learn to handle everything. That's very good. Look at that. Doc, look at him! That's a good sign Joey. See, he's coming back to life. Look, you see the way he's holding on? He's coming back. He's gonna be alright. There we go. Ah, well that's enough of that. You're gonna have quite a bit to tell the kids at school, aren't you? I sure am. What is it? A couple of weeks from now? Yeah. I've been having so much fun that I almost forgot all about it. Gee Dr. Fredericks, I could learn so much here with Louie and you've been so nice to me. Yeah, well I enjoy having you here. I like to watch you work with the animals. It's a chance to rediscover through your eyes the love of life and ecology that I have. I see myself in you Joey at your age. I jus wish some one had given me the opportunity that you have. We grow up too soon Joey. In a little while, this will be your world and you gotta be equipped to take care of it. Do you understand what I'm saying? I think so. You will. Look around you at all the living things and say this is my world and I'm going to do the best I can to take care of it. Alright, I'll buy you a cold drink and a hot dog as soon as I change and wash up. OK? OK! Young man. Yes ma'am. May I help you? Do you know a little boy who worked here named Joey? Well, I'm his aunt. He forgot his jacket this morning. Now where can I find him? Oh let's see. I saw Joey a little earlier with Dr. Fredericks. Oh, well that's fine. Now, will you tell me how to find him and I'm sure the doctor can direct me to Now, if you go right inside there, you will see a booth inside the door and they can direct you to Dr. Fredericks' office. Thank you very much. You've been a big h Nothing like a hot dog when you're hungr Makes you wonder what they do at home. Where you off to now? Oh, I guess I'd better go feed my friend. He's getting used to his new home. Besides, his appetite has sure picked up. Go feed your whale. You know, I think he looks forward to your visit. He sure does. You ought to see him come up out of the water for me. Well, take it easy, huh. Remember, we don't take any chances arou No sir. You can go now. Do you do this around your own house? No. We got to keep this place clean. I'm sorry. Oh. You alright? Oh, I'm perfectly alright. It's my fault. I'm Joey's aunt. You're aunt Meg. I have heard a great deal about you. Well, yes, um, I brought Joey his jacket. He forgot it. Oh, I'll take it to him. May I see him? Where he's working? Certainly. Come on. I'd love to show off the place. This way. And we have a continual training program for the animals. That's so interesting. No wonder why Joey likes to spend so much time here. Hey! Hey Joey! He should've been here. Hey what are you doing? My aunt came to take me home. Don't tell her where I went. Probably going down for more fish. Let's go back this way. Joey! It's funny. he seems to be headed for the pier. Joey! Joey! Hey Joey! Look out there. It's Joey! Joey! Come back! Do something please. Do something! radio our ship at Geronimo. Come on. Doc, Geronimo's coming in now. Have you heard from the coast guard? No, not yet. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. This time of year the fog settles in between Catalina and here and it's rough. What if they don't find him. I just had a feeling something like this was going to happen and I was right. You should have kept him at home. It's not their fault. Joey was just afraid. Afraid that we were going to take him home. That we weren't going to let him come back. Did you hear what happened to the kid?pp Hi Doc, what can I do to help? You and Louie get on the Geromino. Make some sweeps. He could be carried out to sea. The tide was running out at the time. Call his name. Keep calling. The helicopters are not coming. The coast guard said it would be impossible in this fog. Well now don't you folks worry we'll find him before he gets a chance to get hungry. Well, what are you waiting for? Let's ge You take it easy. We'll find him. He's OK. I am sure of it. You coming with me? I'm shoving off. These boys know the channel here at Marine Land better than anybody in the world, including the coast guard. They'll find him. All lines are clear! Hey Doc. Bob here has come up with an idea. Do you know the boat that the kid is using is the same one that we've been using in our testing with the dolphins. What are you thinking? Well, the dolphins have been trained to pick up the boat in this new test that we have going on f Yeah, I dig that idea. Go on. Why don't we send one of them out? Cue it to go after the boat. If anyone can find that boat, he can. Fog or no fog. Look, we've never tried it in open water before. I mean, the tank is one thing but letting him loose in the ocean is another. I don't know. It's pretty dark out there. The kid is still out there. It's going to be a lot of traffic out th Alright, let's give it a try. Get one of the animals from the tank. I will clear it with Monahan. It's worth a try. Thanks Doc. Let's go. Pull it all the way up. Ready. Leslie, don't get underneath it. Get back. Go find the boat. Go find the boat. Go find Joey. Go find the boat. Go find Joey! Go find the boat! Go find Joey! There he goes. Now we find out if the training pays off. Joey! Joey! Can't see much in this fog. Joey! Joey! Fog's thicker captain. Joey! I brought you a cup of hot coffee. Warm enough? Yes, thank you. Sorry about that dolphin. It was worth a try. Sorry it didn't work. Yeah. Hey Doc, the Geronimo is coming in! Ahoy pier! Hey throw me a line! Tie everything up! You think they found Joey? You found him? No luck! We came in for fuel. Could use some hot coffee. Come up and get it while they are refuel the lines! Come on. You can do it. You saw nothing at all? No sign of the boat. It's so small and in this fog. I don't know what your chances are of seeing him in the dark, but you gotta try. Well, I can't help but feel that the fog is gonna lift. We were getting some breaks and with a l Look! Hey the kid's OK! He got him! Oh boy! Good boy! Yes sir! It's alright. Come on son. Let's go. I knew the porpoise would do it! Are you alright? Are you alright? Sure, but I'm hungry. Well, I'm gonna take you home and feed you the best meal you have ever had in your life. Whatever you want. Good job Doc. Well, I guess I won't be seeing you for a while, but I'll be back on the weekends. My mother and my aunt say I have to go to school. Even Doc thinks it's a good idea. You know, we're really gonna miss you around here. Yeah, we are all gonna miss you a lot. Hey Joey. Boy, you sure gave us a bad scare. Why did you do just a th gonna take me home. I don't know. I got in that home and I got lost. Well, everything turned out OK. Kind of, but I won't be seeing you for a while. But your aunt, I'll talk to her. starts Monday. I go to school. Oh yeah, you go to school. I want you to go to school and be smart, because I don't want you to be a dumb fisherman like me. The best darn fisherman in the whole world. In America anyway. Joey, come over here. I'm going up to the whale tank. While you were gone, I moved your friend up on top. He's gonna be one of the stars of the show. I knew he would make it! Hi fella! Hey, how about that? When did you start a thing like that. Oh, his tongue itches. He's my friend and I scratch it for him. Haven't I told you? Ah, forget it. Well, fella, I won't be seeing you for a while. I got to go back to school. If only fish were at the school. Very funny. I can learn more around here You know what you said. I let you work here, and you go back to school and you work hard, right? Right. OK. I'm hungry. How about you? Me too! Let's go. Yeah! Joey, hurry up and finish your breakfast. The bus will be here in a minute. Alright. School..yuck. Remember our agreement? I mean, you got to work at Marine Land, didn't you? Yeah. What was that? I mean yes ma'am. I said I'd go to school, but I didn't say I'd like it. That's enough of that .There's your bus. Now hurry on. Hurry up! They're waiting for you! Doc, the news reel camera man and our photographer want to go in and shoot some pictures in the tank. Is that OK?PP Doc, he won't eat. What do you thinks wrong with him? I will know more as soon as I get time with him. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy there. What's wrong with him Doc? I should know tomorrow. What do you think Doc? Why won't he eat? I'll know more as soon as I get blood samples. What about our star Doc? Will he be ready to work Satur run blood through a lab test. You sit down and eat your breakfast like a gentleman. Saturday is a busy day at Marine Land.PP sit and eat your breakfast properly. Ah darnit. Besides that I don't think they're going to have too much time to bother with you today. Jack Dr. Fredericks said that they have a very sick whale on their hands. My whale's sick? He's not your whale, and yes he's sick. Well, he's my friend and I got to go see him. Well for heaven's sake. Whoever heard of having a whale as a friend? Well, he's my whale and I'm needed down there. Alright, alright, we'll drive you down, but first eat your breakfast. Hey, what's your hurry? I heard my friend is sick. Your friend? Yeah! Oh, the whale. See if it'll work. Physically he's fine. What's the matter with him Doc? Is he gonna be alright? It's alright Joey. It's just like people. Sometimes they don't feel like working. He doesn't feel so good because he's not eating, and I caught his favorite kind of fish. Can I see him please. He's my friend. Yeah, sure. It's OK. Don't be disappointed if he ignores you. Hi there old fella. Did you miss me? Aren't you ashamed of y You had everybody worried and you wouldn't do your act. Just because you didn't feel like it. How would it be if we all did that. Look at me. I got to go to school whether I feel like it or not. See all those people coming in? Well they come in to see you and all those kids...well, they come in to see you to. If you want the fish, you got to work for them, OK? He's OK now. We had a little talk and he said he'll do the show. He said what? Well now you know Joey. He missed you. That's why he wouldn't work. You know something. I think you're right. Well, what are you waiting for? Get the show on the road. You wanna put him through his paces? Honest? You mean it? With the audience and everything? Let's go. Sure thing. Without him, there wouldn't be a show. Well, you're the best darn trainer in the whole world. Well, in America anyway. It's showtime and welcome to the killer whale coliseum. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the youngest animal trainer in the world, Joey! Come on Orci! Do it! Bow for the people. Joey brings Orci for a great big bow and here he comes. Orci! Yay! Hey, will you look at that kid out there with those killer whales. Are they gonna let him ru He's my nephew. I'm his aunt Meg. OK, Orci, you get a lot of fish. OK, Orci needs a little reward for that. So, let's give him one right down the old hatch. And now ladies and gentlemen, the most difficult act we have here at Marine Land. Joey, our trainer at the far side will instruct our trainer Joe to actually get into the tank and ride Corky around the tank. Watch out now! Low bridge. And here they are. Back home, safe and sound. Joe and Corky, with a job well done. Not to be done all done, Joey makes a deal with Orci for a trip to Catalina next week. And they shake on it. OK, Orci and Corky leaping up and out of the water on their sides. This is what the old whalers refer to as reaching. Hey, Joey has decided that Orci has an itchy tummy. So he wants you to get right down on that platform and take care of that itch. And any friend of Joey's is a friend of Orci. Are you ready Joe? now that's confidence, courage. Stupidity? And that concludes Joey's show so stars wave goodbye! I'm so glad that school is out. I really need a change. See what summer's all about vacation in my brain. Tired of all these same old faces.
