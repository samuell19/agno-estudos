What is it with this thing? We've just had it serviced, and it won't open. No, I don't know what to do, Cassim, but you know what my sister is like. I said I was not going to do a favor and choose the fabric for her dress, but now it looks like everything I choose, she says it won't go with anything. -I say you must teach her a lesson. -Yeah? That's what I say. You shave her eyebrows off while she's sleeping. Then you take eye pencil, right? And you draw it back on, but you draw it higher up on her forehead. That way, whatever fabric we choose now, she'll still look surprised. Won't she? How about this one? I can try. What else can a person do but try? Just make to Ah, she actually likes this one. Do you still want eight meters? -Please. -Okay, that's fine. You know, Ebrahim, that child of yours, he makes me laugh. Tell me man, shame, why isn't he married yet? His mother asks me the same question every day. You know, come to think of it, my cousin Farzana would be perfect for him. I've actually got photos of her here. She just got top honors at the medical school. Very bright, shame, and very din conscious. Always wears parda, and beautiful, mashallah. Lots of people say she look like my twin. Anyway, so I can set up a meeting but just not right now because, you know, this wedding is really stressing me out. Excuse me, MacGyver, eight meters raw silk. That's 950 rand. Cassim, have you got some change? Don't worry. When Cassim takes over the shop, he'll have computers, Internet, spreads and sheets. Everything. You know, she has been coming into this shop since she was a small child with her mother. More than 30 years. That's loyalty for you. Would you like to buy some fabric? Hello, ma'am. How are you? You wanna try some of this fabric? Hi, ma'am. Would you be able to just... Please. You're going to have to talk to your father. -What are you suggesting? -Maybe... -add some different products. -Like what? -Like shoes or-- -Shoes? Or those Panjabi pantsuits that are so popular. Yes. Everybody wants them these days. We can even get a mannequin to put in the window. I'm not having half-naked women in my shop. We are not covering costs, Ebrahim. My father started a fabric shop. That's what this is. I am not going to give them the satisfaction. No. But Daddy said, when I was 16, I could get a phone. Not now, Aisha. Let your father eat first. Pass me the roti, Ma. Put it here. You know, from the time you were small, Ebrahim, you used to eat my rotis with two hands. Daddy! I said, when you are older, we will buy you a cellphone. All my friends have them. And my cousins. Right hand, Aisha. There was a lecture at the mosque on Friday. The Imam was telling us about all the terrible things on the phone like "Mixing It" and "tooter." He also said that the children were on "Facebrick" and "stabbing" each other. It's "poking," Daddy. Where do you see your cousins anyway? Around. Cassim, you're going to get indigestion, eating so fast. -Sorry, Ma. -What's the hurry anyway? We're going to see a Bollywood movie at the Zone, and it's getting late. Who's fetching you? Yusuf? Ji, Ma. He's picking me up in the lemon. Dude, you remember that girl, Crystal? Yeah. The one who made you fail economics. I remember. I did not fail economics. They did not mark one of the sections in the paper. Bruh, 47% is a fail. Anyway, I bumped into her today. And I asked her what she's doing tonight, and she said she's going to go check out this new place with her friends in Melville. -So? -She's asking me out, dude. It's the Code. It's the Woman Code. Here you are on about this Code, and I don't believe in this Code, boss. You don't even speak to women, man. How would you know the Code? Dude, I speak to women all the time in the shop. All the time! They love me, boss. I charm them. I make them laugh. They love me, and I don't know your Code. Aunties. You speak to aunties. You know the Auntie Code. You don't know the Woman Code. So you coming with me or what? Fine. Whatever. Can we just go? I thought you just had her serviced. And you? Where's you bicycle? By the Pakistanis? She's just warming up, for your information. You came here from Lens. How long does it take for the car to warm up? Take it back. I take it back. I take back taking it back. My name is Cassim, and I'm Muslim. It's awesome to be here. But I'm surprised also, bruh, that you got here on time. You know, I'm really surprised because Indian people, you know, they're always 15 minutes away. Always. You phone them, it's like, "How long are you going to be, boss?" He's like, "Fifteen minutes, boss. Fifteen minutes." Then you phone back 15 minutes later, "How long are you going to be now?" "Fifteen minutes, boss." Also, everything is around the corner. "Where you?" "I'm around the corner." The guy is driving from Johannesburg to Cape Town. "Where are you?" "I'm around the corner." "Like where?" "Bloemfontein." "How long you gonna be?" "Fifteen minutes, boss. Fifteen minutes." That was great, but listen. I've been in this business a long time. I've most probably got socks older than you. You do good stuff. I know a couple of people. I'll call them up, tell them to pull in, and check you out. And then we'll see what happens, all right? Cool, that would be awesome. Next time will be a bigger audience. Why don't you help out? So invite 300 of you closest relatives. You got to go? Yeah. Merv, thanks. I appreciate everything. It's really no trouble. Well done. -Cool, I'll see you soon. -Ciao. You see, bruh, that's the problem with the Code. You could be misinterpreting it. No. It's fine. The Code could have changed without you knowing it. It's fine. I hate this car. I hate this car. I hate this car. I heard that. I don't care. What is this? Herbie Goes to Fordsburg? Hey. How are you? I'm good. Why you up so late? I must have fallen asleep here, then. -How was the movie? -It was good. Time for bed? Sit for a bit. I want to talk to with you. It wasn't me. I didn't do it. Come on, come on. Be serious. -It was Aisha. -This is important. You know how proud I am of you for standing side by side with me in the shop? Ji, Dad. I want you to look after the keys from now on. And at the end of the year, I want you to take over properly. Thank you, Daddy. I waited a long time for this, my boy. -Molo, Mr. Kaif. -Hello, Mandisi. Molo, Cassim. -Put it here. -Mandisi. -Your post here. -Thank you. Sharp, sharp, boss. See you, Mandisi. I don't know. I just don't know. I mean, how many years is it going to take for them to get it right? I'll take it across, Dad. Can't they just read the address? Is that too much to ask? Kaif &amp; Son, Main Street. Kaif &amp; Son, Oriental Plaza. I mean, does this look like the Oriental Plaza? Okay, Dad. I'll take it across. Check that girl there. She's jolling around everywhere. -So give her my number. -Give her your number? Do you know what a mission it was to get her number? Hey, lower you gaze, gents. Hey, cuz. Farouk, how are you? -Always good. -What's happening? Wrong delivery. -Postman Pat? -More like Postman Patel. That's very funny. How's the deals going, cuz? I just got a five bar tender. Came through the other day. This guy. I can't even afford clothes at China Mall, and this guy, five bar tender. 'Cause you dress like you from Azaadville, like a big maulana. Azaadville is the fourth holiest Muslim site in the world. I think it's about the fifth, maybe the third. Excuse me. I'll see you later. -You on the horn with Shaun. -Hey, Shanawaaz, where are you, man? Yeah, I'm about 15 minutes away from there. We've got five meters. Yes, yes, come quickly. Come fast. Bye. How's things? Fine, Uncle Raf. And you? Hey, strong as an ox. You know, your auntie, she can't keep up with me. That is too much information there, Uncle Raf. Too much. Yeah. Twenty-five years in the business, and I never missed not one day's work. I'm not like your cousin. He's not interested in working. He's just interested in golf and blondes. He thinks he's Tiger Woods. Mohammed, take this to the storeroom. So how's your father? He's the same, you know. Is he going to Rezia's wedding? Last I heard, he was. Ji, ji, ji. And you? When you getting married? You can't stay happy all your life. Let's go have something to eat. Jazakalah, Uncle, Daddy's alone in the shop. Hello, Dawid, what took you so long? -I'll just take this one. -Okay, salaam alaikum. See you. Yeah. Dawid, after the last deal we did, what's the rate? You know, my people, we're not really into the inter-cultural relationships, not really. You know, other cultures, they think it's exotic, you know. "My son is marrying a person from Durban. You know, my son, Luke, he was born in Paris. The girl is a Durbanite. The kids will be parasites. We are very happy." Not our culture. It's like, "Oh, no. My son is marrying someone different." "What you talking about? She's also Indian." "Yes, but not from the same village. Why can't he be a good boy and marry his cousin? I don't know why." You must remember her, Cas. You and her used to play together all the time. No, Ma. Such a sweet child. -Wasn't she quite fat? -No. And she wore those thick black glasses. And that squeaky voice. Yeah, now I remember. Zulfa "Four-eyes." -That's the one. -That's the one. Remember how she'd make salaam, like a mosquito. Anyway, she's going to be at the wedding. Roll a little thinner, Fatima. -Wasn't she overseas or something? -Yes. She was studying in London. London? Terrible. Very cheap girls from there. Like that lady... -Di? -No, no. The one that wore the meat. Lady Gogo. Lady Gaga, Dadima, and she's American. And the meat wasn't even halal. She's a very nice girl from a very nice family, and she's educated. I see another problem, Mummy. What's that? Isn't Zulfa's father on Dad's blacklist? Aisha. Like just about everyone else in Fordsburg. You know, I think she's got a point there, Fatima. Thinner, Fatima. Yes. I don't think Ebrahim will approve of this marriage. Marriage? What marriage? Who's marriage? So besides the fact that she is a bit mashallah... Huge. ...and she wears those weird glasses and has that terrible voice. Very bad. She is also the daughter of one Dad's enemies. And a bit on the dark side. When did I say I wanted to get married? Just stop it all of you. You‘re giving me a headache. Ma, what did I do? I can't see nothing. Hey, dude, what's up with this suit, bruh? If you have to go bungee jumping in this suit, and there's guys that's clay-pigeon shooting, they will shoot you, and you will die, not because of you bungee jumping, because you look like a clay pigeon. At least, I don't look like Colonel Sanders. Yusuf, have you seen Dadi? No, I haven't seen Dadima, Auntie Fatima. Okay. In fact, your new name is Roland Garros. I think Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal can play a tennis match on you. There you are. Everyone's looking for you, Dadima. Is Dadima okay? What's wrong? From the time they were small, they used to be the closest of friends. Now, they can't even say salaam to each other. It's okay, Dadima. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. That's a very nice dress you're wearing. -Thank you. -Look, he's talking to Zulfa. That's half of Zulfa, Mummy. You enjoying the wedding? Yeah. But you know how these things are. You can't completely relax, you know? Why? Well, you know, my mother is sort of trying to hook me up with someone, you know? Who? You know, just this kid from when I was small. And you don't want to see her, why? No, no, no. She was this weird podgy little kid. Fat, really. And she had these thick, thick black glasses. She sounds kind of cute. No, not cute, annoying. Like, she had this squeaky voice. She was always, like, buzzing around like a really fat... What's a really fat insect? -I don't know, a beetle? -Yeah. A beetle. Just like a really big, fat beetle with glasses, just like... Cassim. I'm Zulfa. I'm Zulfa. You know, the beetle girl. But... The glasses? Contact lenses. Amazing that a person can actually change in 20 years. Maaf, Zulfa. I'm-- -It's fine. -No, no, no, it's not fine. -I'm an idiot. -You are an idiot. But it's fine. I'm going to buzz off. Bye. Absolutely, sure. Nice seeing you again Zulfa. She's so pretty. So you're in matric next year? Ji, Uncle. Can you believe how the time flies? You still doing well at school? I'm trying. And your birthday is still in April? -Twelfth of April, yeah. -Yeah, yeah. Two days after Selma. Yes, Uncle. I remember, she's always so particular about what she wanted. So I think it's best that you can choose something for yourself. Take it. Take it, please. Take it. No, no, no! That's not how it works, Rafiq. -Come on, Ebrahim. It's a present. -That's not how it works! Please. This is madness. -We don't want your money. -No. -Take this money, Rafiq. -No. Take it! You made your decisions all those years ago, Rafiq. Now you think because you have a big fancy shop and a big fancy car, -you can give handouts to my family. -She's my niece. We don't want your money! It's just a birthday present, Ebrahim. Don't bring the children into this. Let's go! Fatima, let's go. I'm sorry, Ma. I can't stay. Fatima, let's go. Enjoy your day. Why didn't you go speak to her, man? Dude, I can't speak to her. I can't even breathe when I'm with her. You know what it's like for me. When I see her, it's like she's in slow motion, boss. She's like... You know what's that? -You know what's that, my brother? -What is it? It's the thunderbolt. What's the thunderbolt? Godfather Part I. Don't you remember? Michael Corleone, he shoots Victor Sollozzo. Then he has to go to Sicily, and, when he gets to Sicily, he sees this beautiful woman. And then bang! He shoots her. No. He gets struck by this thunderbolt. Love at first sight. Yeah, Zulfa is beautiful. My friend, once you get struck by the thunderbolt, it's overs cadovers, finish and klaar. I don't know what to do. There is only one thing I can think of. Has anybody been for a Pakistani head massage? You might as while stick your head inside a lawn mower. It's the same thing. It rattles your brain around for like 20 minutes, and this is supposed to relieve tension. You know... Have you ever been in the middle of a massage and praying for load shedding? Eskom, save me now. You know, I'm actually happy I did it. I'm happy I did it. I'm still stressed out, but at least I know why Pakistanis walk around... Wahid bought halal hot cross buns. -What's wrong, right? -Yes. Ruksana says he's coming out with his own version, calling it the Tali-bun. Cassim is a real comedian. Yes, he is. You know about this? -About what? -About Cassim being a comedian. I know. Cassim likes to make people laugh. No, no. Cassim is a real comedian. What? My nephew told me this. He is doing this, what do you call it, stand-up comedy. "Stand-up comedy"? Yes, yes, stand-up comedy. My nephew says he's very good. He can make people laugh. He's very funny. Where is he doing this? I don't know. At some bar, Melville side, I think. Ebrahim, here's your linen. Boss, I have got some beautiful samples for you today. Look, I'll just flip through them for you... Is everything all right with you, Cassim? Dad? I'm asking, is everything all right with you? You know, in your life. Sure. Why wouldn't it be? Just asking. Everything is cool, Dad. Good. He's doing what? I don't know what you call it. Standing comedy. -Stand-up comedy? -Yes, that. You know anything about this? No, I know nothing. It's the first I hear of this. Ma, it's not a big deal. So lying to your family is not a big deal? So is this what you want to do with your life now? No, no, Ma. It's just a hobby. What kind of a hobby is that? You know what these people are like. It's "F this" and "F that." And the blasphemy. He's a good boy, Ebrahim. So that means he can lie to us? He says he just wants to make people laugh. Then tell him to join the bloody circus! And you can make him a clown suit from the fabric in the shop. I'm telling you, Fatima, this boy needs to grow up. Life is not a funny business! It's very important in life to know who you are, Cassim. You can't know where you are going if you don't know who you are. I know that, Dad. Standing in a bar full of drunk people is not who you are, Cassim. You can make us laugh. You always have. But not there. That is not our world. I'm not making it my world. You've started already, my boy. By lying to us. Why did you do lie? I thought you'd tell me not to do it. I'm not telling you not to do it. I'm asking you not to do it. Please, don't do it. Yusuf, how long do we know each other? Since that time you stole my sandwich in primary school. -I never stole your sandwich. -It was in your mouth. -You gave it to me. -You took it. I was hungry. Yeah, now, since that time you know me, do I listen to me parents? All the time. You listen to you parents so much that my parents say, "Why can't you be more like Cassim?" -Do you how irritating that is? -Exactly. I'm an irritating, compulsive listener. You sound like you're between a rock and a hard place. What does that actually mean? Like, you know the plates under the sea, the tectonic plates? You know, the Indian plate and the Filipino plate, when they come together, bang, there's a tsunami. You're between there. I've just got to figure out a way to actually do the comedy without anybody knowing. Yeah? You need an alibi. A watertight alibi. You know, like Sleepers. Robert De Niro, he plays a priest. In the end, he's the alibi to those two guys that kill that other bruh. -Yeah, you need that. -Yeah. I mean, is this comedy thing so bad? I don't think so. -But I'm not your father. -Yeah. I'm also not my father. Maybe we must phone Robert De Niro and tell him to play the Imam. Ebrahim, the kid was with me. Cassim won't lie. The kid was with me. Are you doubting me? Are you doubting my word? So where is the talk, Cassim? It's at the Civic Theatre, Daddy. It's so exciting. Deepak Chopra. That's a wonderful man. He's got so much noor on his face, and he's not even Muslim. I don't know where Yusuf is. We're going to be late. Probably the traffic. It's no more rush hour. Now it's rush day. Where have you been, dude? -The traffic was terrible. -You see? Have you got the tickets? Got it. Deepak Chopra. Sit down, Yusuf. Have something to eat first. -Have a samoosa. -No, no Yusuf's not hungry. It's fine. We're going to go now. It's fine. -Just one samoosa. -Have some for the barakat. -You want a Coke or something? -Coke. -Cassim. -Okay, Ma. Fine, I'll do it. It's fine. I like the samosa. -He can have some Coke. -More! No, its fine. I think it's okay. Enjoy. Bismillah. We're late. Drink faster. -Some more? -No, no. Sure anybody else don't want to come with? -I'd like to come. -You have school tomorrow. I've always got school. Yes, until you have finished school, you will always have school. Now, you two go and enjoy yourselves. Okay. I'll come. -Dadima, want to come with? -Yes. It's Chopra. But won't Dadima be tired? Yeah. He speak for long. He speaks for long. Yeah, and the seats is not comfortable. Yeah, the aircon is cold. -Yeah. -It's very cold. As long as I'm not seated behind Jackson 5. Let me go get my nice scarf. Dude, what did you do that for? We were home and dry. I was trying to cement the alibi. The alibi was watertight. What did you have to add cement for? Now the whole thing's going to collapse. Boys. Mind, body, and soul, here we come. So what time does the show start? I think Deepak starts at 8:00, isn't it, Yusuf? Yes, it starts at 8:00. I'm not talking about Deepak. I'm talking about the comedy, Seinfeld. Whenever I go to a Muslim wedding, right, I always meet people there who know how I'm connected to everyone. You see, there's this unofficial Muslim intelligence network on the weddings. They're called the "Aunties." They know their connections, boy. They're like, "Osama? Yeah, he's Farid's connection. You know Cookie Khala's husband's cousin brother, Rafiq Ali? Now his second wife's sister is married to Jacoob Hadja from Ladysmith. Now, Jacoob's brother, Shabir, used to work for and Farid from Afghanistan, and Farid is Osama's second cousin's adopted son." "Osama bin Laden?" "No. Osama Tayob, the charted accountant. You think I'm talking about Osama bin Laden? Don't be stupid, man. He's connected from the other side of the family." I have all new movies here. You want Shah Rukh Khan? My Name Is Khan? -Hundred percent copy. -No, no. I'm... I have Aamir Khan 2-in-1. Ghajini, 3 Idiots. No, no, I don't want movies. You want CD. Adnaan Sami, latest copy. Mashallah. No. I'm looking for... stand-up comedy. -Comedy? -Yes. Munna Bhai. Yeah. Very good. I've got 95% copy, but if you come tomorrow, I can give you 100% copy. No, no, not Bollywood. Stand-up. No English. Okay. Asif, what’s wrong with this person? He wanted to rent a comedy flick, and then refused to take it when offered. Such a weirdo. I need you to smuggle this across the border for me. Open it. Cas, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I can't believe you got me a phone. You like it? It's perfect. It's a great color. -Thank you so much. -Yeah, it's not the best phone, but you can get "Facebrick" and "Tooter" on it. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's awesome. It's perfect. Thank you so much. -Just look after it, okay? -I will. You know you can't trust those scary white children at that Model C school. Do you want some tea? Masala tea. I bumped into Auntie Shaida the other day. Yeah? She said everyone was very upset about what happened at the wedding. They're still talking about it. Did she say anything about Zulfa? No. I don't understand it. You and her were getting on so well at the wedding. Yeah, we were. Very well. Very well. Like, there's one place in Johannesburg where all the Indian people congregate, all of them. It's so many Indians there, it's almost like it must be part of an Indian world tour. "Welcome to Mugtal Uncle's Indian Tours. See the greatest sights of the east. The Taj Mahal, the Qutb Minar, and Zoo Lake on a Sunday." ...loud. I just put in new subwoofers, 15 inches, plus four tweeters, amplified sound, everything. They installed it yesterday. I got that on my phone. You're on the horn with Shaun. Yeah, I'm about 15 minutes away from there. Okay, cool. I've got to bounce. I'll see you guys later. I think my tympanic membrane is ruptured. -What? -Yours also. Dude, let's just go around once more. She must be around here somewhere. I need another alibi. I told you I got an alibi already, man. It's a watertight alibi. Now what is it? How can it be a watertight alibi when I have to tell you? You know that girl? No, man, that laaitie needs rattan. Man, we've been five times around this thing, and I haven't seen her anywhere. Look. Nowhere. She has to be. There! Check! No, dude. Come, just... It's... Wait... I don't know. Where are you going to, bruh? There's your opportunity. Go speak to her. No, go speak to her. We've been walking around five times and listening to the ducks, and now you don't want to go speak to her. Go speak to her now. It's your opportunity. -It's good exercise. -Okay, okay. Just wait. You the man. You can do it, man. -I'm the man. -She's beautiful, bruh. I'm the man. You can do it, man. Stomach in, chest out. What... Stop. Stop it. Stop it, please. -Just stop it! -Mommy! -Sadia! -Please. Please... Please don't... Please don't cry. Mommy. My pram! My pram! I'll get your pram, little girl! Auntie! Uncle! Nani, watch out! My bunion. -Ma'am, I'm very sorry. -How could you? -I'm really sorry. -Nani, are you okay? -No. My toe. -You. What are you doing with my child? It's disgusting. Come, Nani. I won't lie to you. That wasn't so good. -It was bad. -Yeah. -She must think I'm a... -A nooita. I wasn't going to say that, but yeah. Nogolosh. If only there was, like, some way I could actually get to have a normal conversation with her. You know, so she can see the real me. I mean, I'm a nice guy. You're the nicest guy I know. I don't know. Dead Poets Society. -Is that Latin? -Yes. Seize the moment. Cometh the man, cometh the hour. Strive and conquer. I don't know what's wrong with me. What? Row, boatman. Row. Come. Row. I'm seizing the day now. -Seize the day. -I'm gonna seize the day. I'm seizing the day, man. Okay, but now we're going in a circle. Okay let me navigate. I'm gonna go to the starboard. Or is it port? That side of the boat, I'm going. Just watch the sticks. Don't let the sticks fall in the water. It's called "oars," boss. "Oars." Whatever. Whatever. Faster, boss. Why don't you row? We're going to miss her. Faster, man. I'm going as fast as I can. I'm not Oscar Chalupsky. Natalie du Toit got one leg. She can go straight. Why are we going towards the ducks? I don't want to see the ducks. Go towards the girl. -Row. -I'm rowing Okay, I'm going to jump out from here. Dude, Jump! Good luck. Yes, my arms are a little sore. Breathe! Now speak! Sorry. I just wanted to say that, ever since I saw you at the wedding, I was like... You know, like the thunderbolt from The Godfather. No? Anyways, I can't speak when I'm around you, and I just wanted to say that I think you are beautiful and amazing and... I'm really sorry about calling you a fat beetle, and your nanima's' bunion. And I'm really sorry about that whole thing with my dad at the wedding. That was very bad. So... Basically, I just want to say I'm sorry, and I think you're amazing. But I already said that. Less is more! So I'm going to go. And I hope to see you around. And... Bye. Bye. Bye. This guy. Careful. Just be cool now. Hrithik Roshan. How do I reverse this thing now? Act natural. -Wave. -Natural. Right, everything is awesome. I'm facing the wrong way. Okay, just act natural. Wave to her, boss. Wave. The bloody stick. -Dude, look what you done. -You said I must wave. What if he's still doing this thing. -What thing? -This comedy. What if he's still doing this comedy right under our noses? Ebrahim, they've gone to play action cricket. Why is he interested in this thing anyway. I don't know, Ebrahim. He likes it. Likes it? Likes what? Too much laughter is haram. I'm just making sure you're looking quite kwaai tonight. Something... -What are you doing? -Nothing. Nothing's going on. -You're acting very strange now. -No. -What's happening? -Nothing's happening. Absolutely nothing is happening. No big deal. I asked Zulfa to come. No big deal. -You asked Zulfa to come? -Yes. -Zulfa is here? -Yes. You were the one that said, "If only she could see the real me." Then I thought, "No. She must see you do stand-up 'cause that's the real you." -You. That's-- -That's not... That's you, come from here. You're gonna thank me for this. Like Indian youngsters will never smoke in front of someone older than them. You see this outside wedding reception all the time. You know, a group of young adults standing outside smoking. The minute the older person comes, they all have the same move. It's like... "You need anything?" "What are you children doing out here?" "No, no, Ma. We're just talking, Ma." There's smoke coming out from the backside of this man. "Achha, there's smoke coming out of your back side, eh?" "Yeah, Ma, the biryani was a bit spicy, Ma." Thanks for coming to the show. Thank Yusuf for asking me. I will. I definitely will. You do... You do know that all of this stand-up is top secret, right? Oh, yeah. I got the whole alibi debrief from Yusuf. -Yeah. -This is my alibi. -I'm staying at a friend's house. -Okay. I should be going inside. Thank you again for coming to the show. You're welcome. Yo were amazing. Thank you. Thank you, Yusuf. I... I really like her, Dad. What's her name? Her name is Zulfa. Whose daughter is she? It's Zulfa Ahmed, Dad. Hussein Ahmed's daughter? Dad, just listen first. There's nothing to listen to, my boy. You know our history with the Ahmeds. -Just listen. -No, no, no. End of story. You don't marry the person. You marry the family. But the French... I don't know if you've heard about the French. The French wanted to ban purdah. You know the purdah? You know? 'Cause they think it's about oppressing women. You know, it's not about oppressing women. It's about not objectifying women. I mean, you've never seen a Saudi version of Playboy. "Mahmood, Mahmood, check it out. Look at the naked eyes, Mahmood." But it's bad, huh? They ridicule our culture 'cause they don't understand the wisdom behind it. Like, take swine flu, for instance. All of a sudden, you had Europeans scared of pigs. We've been saying that for years. Europeans were so paranoid about swine flu, they were walking around airports, wearing masks. Take a look at our women. We've been saying that for years. Dave, it's such an honor to meet you. I watch your CDs all the time. No, cool, man. Merv said I should come and have a look. -Yeah, your set wasn't bad. -Thanks, Dave. Coming from-- Not that it was good, but it wasn't bad. Cool. Can I get you a beer? No, no, I'm fine. Thanks. I'm sorry. Sorry forgot the no drinking, no pig, no having fun. What do you call it? It's got that... sound, Yeah? -Haraam. -"Haraam! Haraam." That's it. "Haraam, haraam." That guttural... It's bad. It's bad. "Haraam, Haraam." When you hear that... you just know you've done something wrong, eh? "Haraam!" Do you want to play The Attic sometime? -Are you serious? -Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Dave, I'm there. Good. Good. So how does this work? Wednesday, eight o'clock, you be there. Put you on the list. Five minutes, open mic. Just five minutes, don't go over. No, no, I won't do more than five minutes, Dave. He only has five minutes! Good, good, good. Look, you do over five minutes, we throw ice at you. -Ice? -Ice. -Actual ice? -Yeah. What do you mean, like play from the PA system? Just be there at 8:00. Do you know this guy? Oh, sorry. Dave, this is Yusuf. I'm his agent. -How's it, Yusuf? -How's it, Dave? -Cool. -I know you, man. Can you take a picture with me. Cassim? -Dude, be cool, bruh. -I am cool. Take a picture. Dave don't mind. No, no, it's fine. -Okay, Okay. Say, "Paneer." -Paneer. -What? -Paneer. -Say paneer. -It's cheese. -It's cheese in India. -Yeah. -Paneer. -Paneer. One, two, three, go. -Paneer. -Paneer. Proud, eh, bruh? Dude, what do you know about being an agent? -I studied economics. -You failed economics, boss. Please. They did not mark a chapter in my economics paper. And I know the gist of it. You are a very rare commodity, my friend. A Muslim comedian. There's a demand for you out there, and I will supply that demand. Hey, I can't believe it. The Attic. It's unbelievable, boss. The Attic. Thank you for taking me. Dave! What a nice guy! -He's awesome. -Huh? Hello, Yusuf. Hello, Dave. And, you know, it seems like Merv actually does know people. Who would have thought? We are going places, my friend. We are seriously going places. Don't say it. Don't even think it. We owe a lot of money, Ebrahim. People have been kind about it, but, sooner or later, we are going to have to pay it back. -It will get better. -How? We don't have it. It will come. Fatima. We just need to have faith. Maybe it's time to reconsider. -Reconsider? -Speak to Rafiq. You think, after everything I've stood for over all these years, I must just now throw it away because we have some financial problems? -Ebrahim-- -I can't believe you would even suggest such a thing! I just don't know what else we are going to do. We will do what we have always done. Carry on. And, soon, Cassim will take over the shop, and he will make changes. And he will make a success of it. It's as simple as that. Bring me some tea, Cassim. You want some tea? Aisha! Who gave you that? I'm asking you a question. Who gave you that cell phone? Hey! How are you? -I'm cool. I'm cool. -You ready? Huh? Packed. Have you seen that. Packed, packed. You're going to be fine. You're going to be fine. You're first up. -Are you here for the stand-up? -I beg your pardon? Are you here for the stand-up comedy? -Ladies and gentlemen... -Yes. That will be 50 rand please. The show's about to start. You host for the evening, Dave Gold! Show's started. Enjoy. One of the things I love during the World Cup, guys, is to listen, you know, to the football commentary on the TV, but I couldn't... Eventually, I couldn't listen to the BBC any longer 'cause, like, they couldn't pronounce the players' names. "Sibusiso Qaxa." No, turn it down. Put the radio on. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, very special, a momentous occasion. One of the funniest Muslim comedians in the world. Perhaps the only... -Have a good one. -Good luck, son. ...Muslim comedian in the world. Please give a very warm Attic welcome for his debut. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Cassim Kaif. Thank you. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Dave. My name is Cassim, and I am Muslim. Don't be alarmed, white people. They searched me at the door. Everything is fine. You know it's difficult for my people when we fly, you know? You know, 'cause a Muslim with a plane ticket, it's a little bit suspicious. I did a normal thing. I recited a prayer for good luck to protect me and my family on our journey. It's a normal thing. I was like... Within a minute, everyone else was praying as well. Like, Indian people, generally, you know, we don't really hate other cultures. We more hate our own, like, family. We're too busy doing that. Like, other people, they can have an argument. After five minutes, they apologize. "I'm so sorry, Sheila. I didn't mean to get upset. I know you burnt down my house and killed my dog, but it was an honest mistake." Indian people, we keep grudges for 40 years, and you know why? "Who is she to say that my biryani is dry?" It gets bad, like my dad and my uncle, they haven't spoken for years now, and my dad is one of those people who blames everything on Apartheid. Like, "Why is there so much corruption?" "It's the legacy of Apartheid." Like, "Why is there so much crime?" "Legacy of Apartheid." Like, "Dad, I'm constipated." "Legacy of Apartheid." My mom is from Cape Town, and my dad is from here... "If you protest, you could be put in prison or even killed." "That sounds amazing." Thank you so much. You've been an awesome audience. My name is Cassim Kaif. Thank you. Dave! Cassim Kaif! Keep it going, everybody! Okay! That was actually good. Nicely done. Thanks, man. I hate rugby I hate rugby They are big and dumb and tough And they are ugly If you're a white dude, and you lose weight, you 're gonna walk past a guy, he'll be like, "Pete looks good." And if you're black, and you lose weight in the new South Africa, you walk by, the guys go... "I think he's dying." There's a secret greeting for Indians when they meet Jews, they just go "Hebrew." Rugby, rugby, rugby Rugby Thank you. -Thanks, my man. Thank you. -Sure, man. Listen here, man, I've got a 36 month installment plus laybuy on this watch. -What is this, man? -What do you want? Dollars? -Yeah-- -It's 250 billion Zim dollars. -If you want, I can go and fetch. -It's good. -Happiness? -Thank you, man. Friedman. Thank you. Love your work. Love it. Love it. Dale Amler. Well, thank you. -I think my mom said I should have-- -Dave, you shouldn't have. -Really shouldn't have. -Cassim. Good job. Well done. Well done. -Cool. -See you next week. -Yeah. Definitely, yeah. -Good, good, good. -Thanks, Dave. Thanks for everything. -Listen, before you go, before you go. We've got a little ritual here when a comic makes his debut at the The Attic. We spray him full of beer. Yeah, guys. It's like an initiation come celebration, come rite of passage... -No, no, guys... -No, listen, don't worry. Don't worry. You're a Muslim guy. We know you don't drink, and it wouldn't be appropriate. -It wouldn't be right. -It's haraam basically. But then we thought about it. We thought about it, and we thought, well, initiation isn't supposed to be appropriate in the first place. -Is it? -Not really. What's wrong, Ma? You okay? What's wrong? You think my life is a joke? I am asking you a question? -Is my life a joke, Cassim? -No. Then why are you standing in a bar, telling jokes about my life? When Faheem told me you were a comedian, I didn't believe him at first. Your mother tells me I don't know this thing, this comedy. So I think maybe she's right. Maybe I don't. So, tonight, I went to look at that place, full of drinking and smoking and swearing and everything haraam. And I watched you wash the dirty laundry of your family in front of an audience of laughing drunkards. Watch you make fun of my argument with your uncle. You think that's funny? You think it was funny to watch the bulldozers smash people's houses, people's shops, their entire lives, and then tell them, "Don't worry, you can go to the Plaza." You think that's funny? I stood up to the bloody government and what they were doing to our people so that my son can one day stand in a bar and tell jokes about my life! -Ebrahim. -So that my own son can stab me in the back like my brother and everyone else did. You think that's funny? Go pack your bags, my boy. As of tomorrow, I want you out, out of my house. -Dad... -Ebrahim... Daddy, please. I... I didn't mean to upset you. Please, daddy. -Have you been drinking? -Cassim? No, Ma. It was an accident, they spilt it on me. Kasam Allah, I didn't drink. Kasam, I didn't drink. Keys. I want the keys for my shop. You know, being a Muslim and doing stand-up comedy is very difficult. Like, some people say that too much laughter is haraam. And I don't know what that means. Too much laughter is haraam? Now, I don't know if you know "haraam" means "prohibited." Now, the opposite of haraam is halaal, which means "allowed." And then in between that, we've got makruh, which means "not recommended." So now, when they say, "Too much laughter is haraam," what does that mean? It's like "Ha-ha," that's halaal. That's fine. Then "Ha-ha-ha," that's makrooh, not recommended. Then "Ha-ha-ha-ha," haraam. No, that's not allowed. I am so sorry, Cas. Dad asked me where I got the phone. I didn't want to tell him. -It's okay. -I didn't want to tell him. -I'm so sorry. I'm so... -It's not your fault. There's too many "ha's." There's one too many "ha." It's fine when it's "Ha-ha-ha," but then a "ha," it's too much. Haraam! I don't understand it though. When will you be happy, Ebrahim? When? When everyone is a grumpy old thing like you? You know, you used to be such a happy-go-lucky fellow. You used to laugh more than everyone else put together. Your mother says he just sits there, behind the counter, all day. Doesn't even take a lunch break. It's amazing to me he's never even set foot in this place. Thirty-five years, and he just sat across the road, looking at it. Beta, I know what you are trying to do with this comedy thing. I do. But without the shop, this family has nothing. And without you, there is no shop. Look, I'm Jewish, man. What do you think? When I told my dad I wanted to be a comic, do you think he applauded? No. He was like "How are you gonna make a living? How are you gonna make a living? Who's going to pay the Jewish old age home when I have to move in there? You think it's a charity?" Now he's my biggest fan, man. He tells all his friends, "That kid is hilarious. Hilarious! Takes after his old man," which is not true. I mean, he can't remember a single punchline to any joke, but he does say that I bring him a lot of nachas. Nachas. Do you know what I mean? Nachas. Description of the feeling of joy and pride that parents eventually have. Rachmunus, the opposite. Shame. I'll give you an example, okay? Imagine you're a Jewish guy and your son is selected as the Springbok hooker, okay? Nachas. Nachas. Rachmunus would be the feeling you get when your daughter is selected as the Springbok hooker. Dude, it's a little different in my family. No, no, look. Tomorrow, you can go and think about this and have an existential crisis. Tonight, you are on the bill, my friend, okay, so you get yourself in the mood. You're on in 20 minutes, okay? Right. Backstage. Thank you very much. My name is Tall Ass Mo. Show your love. Tall Ass Mo, everybody! Our President is a polygamist, and, in other parts of the world, they make fun of him. I think it's ridiculous. So what, he's going to marry 16 women, which is true. He's going to marry 16. He's on four. He's got 12 to go. He misunderstood the priest at his first wedding who said to him, "Jacob, four better, four worse, four richer, four poorer." This man has been storming everywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, all the way from Fordsburg, Cassim Kaif! My name is Cassim, and I am a Muslim. Guys, guys, I'm sorry. I can't. And ladies and gentlemen, that's... That was... That was Cassim Kaif. Give it up for Cassim. Yeah! Thank you, my boy. Someone I need to apologize to. How's it, boss? So this is where you hang out, eh? Get it? Curtains? Hang out? Yeah. Dave, listen. I'm really sorry about the other night. -Not cool, dude. -I'm really sorry, boss. -Not cool. -I'm sorry. When are you coming back? Look, man, every comic dies on stage, okay? Not once, many times. It's part of the process. It's what happens. It's not that. It's my father. Just hear me out. I've seen loads of people come through. You actually have something good. -Dude, it's not good for my family. -I'm just saying, just think about it. -Cassim, what's going on here? -Oh, Dad. Sorry. This is my friend Dave. This is my father, Ebrahim. -Hi, Mr. Kaif... -I know who you are, -and I do not want to shake your hand. -Dad? -I want you to leave my shop now. -Dad, calm down. -Mr. Kaif, I-- -Leave now! -Daddy. -Leave please! -Dad! -Your son has a lot potential. That's all. Don't talk to me about potential. You have no idea what you are talking about. -Dad? -Move! -Dad-- -Cassim. Get back to work. -Dad. -What? That was not right. I thought you were finished with this nonsense. I am finish with it, but he just came to say hello. He can say hello in your own time. So I'm not allowed any visitors here? Am I a prisoner in the shop? Show me some respect, boy. How about you showing me some respect for a change? I try my best to do whatever you want me to do. But I'm tired, Dad. I'm tired of being treated like someone who doesn't have a say in his own life. -Hey-- -I have my own life. Don't you dare talk to me like that! Then I can't do this. I can't take over the shop. I can't. I've tried. Believe me, I've tried to stand here with you, but you make... You make things impossible. Then what are you waiting for? The door is there, Cassim. I'm not stopping you. Walk away. Live your fantastic life, telling your jokes. Just don't come back here. It doesn't have to be like this, Dad. Go. Walk! Go! Ebrahim... Stop it! Just stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop pushing people away, Ebrahim. -Fatima-- -I have watched this family broken, living these half-lives. Not wanting to reach out to your own family because of respect for you. All those years, I did nothing. But I am not going to watch the same thing happen to my son. I'm not. I'm not. -Morning, Mr. Kaif. -Morning, Mandisi. -Got your post here. -Thank you. -Thank you, Mr. Kaif. Bye. -Bye. Please, where's the love? Mohammed, where's my Coke Zero. But I think Indians are doing pretty well in the world. We've started with our own space program, which is awesome. Obviously, with international Indians. You know, I can't imagine a local Indian the captain of his own spaceship. You know, like, "Space the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise 3.6 liter GTI." "Mr. Spock." "How's it, Cassim." "Mr. Spock, set a course for the galaxy Lambda Echo Nebulus, also known as LENS. It's 75 million light years away. What is the estimated time of travel?" "About 15 minutes, boss. Just around the corner."
