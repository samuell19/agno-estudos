IN THE LAND OF THE DEAF I was born into a hearing family, and for me, between deaf people and hearing people there was no difference. I thought we could all live together. My mother used to take me to the cinema a lot. I loved it because it was so visual - the actors, the plot. I thought it was wonderful! I watched them moving their lips... and I told myself that I could do the same. I dreamt of becoming an actor. A well-known director lived across the road. One day I asked him if I could act in one of his films, but he said, " impossible, you're deaf. How will you manage with the hearing people?'' I answered, " I can mouth the words like all the actors in films. You can see that they're just miming. Somebody else just needs to record the words." But he kept saying, "No, it's impossible! You need to be hearing to be an actor." That was a terrible disappointment to me. Well done, Abou! Again. Very good. Let's change. No, that's not what I asked you to do. I said - No, that's not what I asked you to do. Go back to your seat. You can't do it. Go on, off you go. Do it properly! Louder. Go on. One more time. Look this way. Everyone's looking good. Everyone smile. That's it! Excellent. We are finished. Very good. Very good. Let's go. The children are singing. The children are singing. Karen. Talk nicely. No, no, no. Put that down. Go on. Now the other one. Good. Jalal, are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Jalal. Ah, yes. it's not on properly. We'll start again. Pay attention. Why are you crying? You don't know? Why are you crying? You are a baby. Come on, recite this! Recite. in the house... there are... dogs... cats... tortoises. in the country... there are... horses... cows... sheep... chickens - Chickens. Do it again. That's better. Chickens. What comes next? Hedgehogs... and bulls. Good. Oral: eight. This is my name sign. There was only one hearing person in my family. My father is deaf, my mother is deaf, my older brother is deaf, and my other brother is hearing. I'm the third, and I was born deaf. We've always used sign language at home. The first time that I had aids put on... it was a very weird feeling. The noise of the chairs - it was awful! All the noises - the chalk on the blackboard... shouting, doors banging - I was completely lost! it was terrible! When I got home, I took them off. I got back to silence. What a relief! The teacher made me keep them on. I had to keep going to the ENT clinic. They used to say, "You'll be just like a hearing person." And I believed them! They are useful for some people, but not for me. in 1 945, I was six. I couldn't speak, and I didn't know sign language. One day my mother took me to a school. it was full of deaf children. They were " signing'' to each other. She left me with them. Little by little, I began to learn signs. After a couple of months I was signing fluently. Nobody taught me anything. I just learned by watching. it's like that with hearing people when there is a baby. With deaf people it's like that. We were boarders. I didn't sleep at home. I used to go to the cinema often. When I got back to school... my friends would gather round and I'd tell them the story. They loved it! They didn't have the money to go. But my mother gave me some. There were a lot of orphans... and children who'd been abandoned because they were deaf. Don't despair... if your child is deaf! Look at me, I'm normal! You must stimulate a deaf child, not overprotect it. You must explain dangers to him, like cars, just as you'd do for any child. But a deaf person does compensate with his eyes. He has a highly developed visual sense. Whereas a hearing person - We have a terrific visual memory. Again. Yes. Now swallow. Go on. That's it. Can you hear it? Florent. Who is it? it's me. Listen carefully. Karen. Good! Babette. Good, Florent. Madame. it's "troi." "Toi." Good. What shall we try next? Jalal. Very good, Florent. That's it. We're done. I want a good mark... because... I did my lesson well. At five. My parents knew when I was five. Before that they thought I was shy, that I didn't talk, that I was very self-contained, that I wasn't listening. When I was five, they took me to the doctor and they found that I couldn't hear... and that I didn't involve myself with hearing people. Eighty percent there. 1 00% here. When I went to school... the hearing children talked, but I couldn't talk like them. That was when I understood that I was deaf. in my family, when they laugh, they always say " We'll tell you later!'' So I don't understand. I'm upset, I cry. I'm unhappy. I can't keep asking them questions. I get fed up! They forget I'm deaf. They talk too quickly. I can't lip-read them! So I give up and go off on my own all the time. in Mr. Chapelain's class we learn expressions. I like learning expressions. it's fun! For example, "To have your head in the clouds." Or " To take to one's heels." We learn different things. I really like learning. More? " To take flight." " To have a lisp." I have got hearing friends, but - but it's a bit difficult because they speak properly. They use fancy words, but I just speak very simply. So I prefer to be with deaf people. My family are all hearing. My brother is hearing. He speaks, but he doesn't sign. My father only knows one sign. " St.James's institute." That's all. My brother, a little bit. My mother can't sign. My mother would like to learn, but it's difficult for her to move her hands and fingers. But she does know a little bit. Never happy! You're playing badly! Lucky that we're not playing for money! My family has been deaf for five generations. My parents... my sisters, my grandparents, my uncles and aunts. My uncle married a woman whose whole family is deaf. The children are deaf. I have an aunt who has a hearing child. Poor thing! My two sisters have married deaf people who came from deaf families. The older one had two deaf daughters... and the second one, two deaf boys. I'm single, and I'm never getting married! At home we use sign language all the time and we have no problems. I come from the clouds. Hello! I'm nice. I don't give smacks. Are you working hard at school? The Christmas tree. I already got a present from him at school last week! We are going to get one. Look! But that'll mean I'll get two! in the old days... sign language was banned in schools. They tied our hands behind our backs to make us talk. Times have changed, but even today many schools don't allow sign language. Now we're campaigning for bilingualism: sign language and French. I hope we succeed. But it's always hearing people who have power in schools. Look, the cars look like toys! She seems to be watching us! She looks like my mother! Do you want stamps? Has she always lived in America? Yes, she was born there. Her father is Asian, and her mother is from France. But her mother doesn't speak French. She speaks American English. Her father speaks Japanese and English. He doesn't speak in America, but when he goes to Japan he speaks Japanese. He learned to speak at school in Japan. And does her mother speak it? No. And her brother? No, he doesn't either. People think... that sign language is international. But that's wrong. in France we have our sign language. in Germany, in Belgium - There is a different sign language in each country. For example, here we say " woman'' and " man." in Germany: " woman,'' " man." in America: " man,'' " woman." in Japan: " Man." " Woman." it's very different from one country to the next. When I go abroad, I meet deaf people in that country. it's a bit difficult at the beginning... but after a couple of days, we can be chatting away with Chinese people, Africans, Americans. it's easy for us. But for you, hearing people, if you go to China - Even with a dictionary! But a couple of days do it for us. Passengers for Flight 03 7 for New York should proceed to Gate 39. Nudge him. Do you want some more? Tomo. Do you want some more? No. I'm working. And we shouldn't be spending money just before the holidays. Thank you. Daddy. My sister and brother are hearing. My parents too. I am the only deaf person in the family. When I was a child, everyone else talked and talked. it was very hard for me! At school all the children were deaf, but the grown-ups, the teachers, were all hearing. The older children were 1 8. They could sign a little bit, but - I was very intrigued because I had never seen deaf adults, whereas I had seen hearing people who were 30 or even 40! We never went out of school, and I used to wonder about a lot of things. I asked myself, " How is it there are no deaf adults? Do we, deaf people, die when we get to 20? We're human beings like other people!'' Then I began to live in hope of meeting some! When I was eight, something happened which I shall never forget. For our holidays my parents had decided that we would go to America, where there is a big university for deaf people. At home we packed our bags, but I had no idea where we were going. We took a taxi very early one morning. it was very mysterious. We arrived at Orly airport. We were walking into the airport when suddenly... I saw lots of deaf people - grown-ups, children. I came out in goose bumps all over! " Mommy, look!'' At last I saw grown-ups who were like me! From that day on, I started to change. I learned sign language. My parents too. We met lots of deaf people over there who told us all about themselves and their lives. Thanks to meeting these people, we could see a bright future for me. A tree. And how do you say " a girl''? And " a boy''? And " Daddy''? Good. And " Mommy''? - Why? - Mommy. And " baby''? I don't know. Is it like this? And " small''? Like this. How do you say " small''? You don't know? Mommy wants to know how to talk like you. " Small''? it's a lovely day. What? it's a lovely day. I've seen it! I've seen your teeth. Are you cheating? I look so I can hear. You're cheating! it's a lovely day. What? it's a lovely day. Did you get it? it's raining! it is lovely! No, it's a lovely day! The sun is shining, so it's a lovely day. Next. Guess. Where is Roxanne? Do you understand? Speak. Where is Roxanne? There you are! My turn! I didn't hear. I didn't hear. Daddy. That's easy! Mommy can hear. Daddy can hear. - Daddy can hear. And Florent? - Yes. - Can you hear? - Yes. Really? You watch. Daddy can hear. That's a big kiss. Florent. This is my name sign. When I was 1 5, my parents didn't know what to do with me, so they put me into an asylum. I was put in amongst mad people, an amazing mixture. I was in a panic. Why had my parents done this? I went over things again and again. I believe they could not imagine that I would ever be able to get a job or lead a normal life. The asylum was run by nuns. Everything was dirty and dilapidated. We were shut up. We had no rights. When hearing people see a deaf person, they often take them for a simpleton. They believe they're not normal. it's terrible. The asylum can wreck human lives. it's a shame. Are you almost finished with the chassis? Are you almost done? As soon as you're done, you can send it on. I'd like you to go on to that machine before 6:00 to check the adjustments. As soon as you're done, you can go down there. You have to undo it at the back. You're going to make the neck dirty. His hat is here. Of course, he lowers his head. You shouldn't wear it tilted like that. You mustn't push it too far on. it'll make a line on your forehead! You'd think he'd been out partying. He always puts it on too tight. Do it like that. Not like that. Your gloves. - Something is sticking out. - it's sticking out everywhere. it should be like this. This keeps sticking up. it's a pain! That's how you carry it. When you take it off, you fold your arm around it. Yes, that's the way. You'll give Marie-Hélène that arm. Because you shake hands with your right hand. Put it on your head. What do you think? He looks good, eh? A bit further forward. Hello. We are here to celebrate the marriage of Mr. Hubert Max René Poncet with Marie-Hélène Da Costa. I shall read to you Articles 21 2, 21 3 and 21 5 of the civil code. Article 21 2: the couple owe each other fidelity, succor, aid.

You both met, and your love was kindled. And today, both of you, like this. You are getting married. You are going to say yes. And God says, "I will never forget Marie-Hélène and Hubert. Have no fear. I will not forget." Marie-Hélène and Hubert, you will read, and then I will translate the vows. " Marie-Hélène, will you - '' Ask her. Will you marry me? Yes. I swear to you... that I shall be with you always, even in times of trouble and difficulty. Hubert, will you marry me? Yes. I swear to you that I shall do everything to love you... and I shall stay with you until the end of our days. I was giving my sign language classes. She was there, among the students. After the class, we chatted. She told me she was divorced. The following weekend... we went out together... to the Eiffel Tower, out to dinner... and we fell in love. Yes, it's true! it was a bit difficult at the beginning with him in Paris and me in Lyon. I didn't like the distance. But we saw each other more and more often. I was very much in love. I wondered what to do about my children... but as they were grown up, I came to live with him. I had had a child with my first wife, a girl. The day she was born, when I arrived at the nursing home, the doctor told me, " She can hear." I had dreamt of having a deaf child. Communication with her would have been easier. But I love her just the same. All right, children. Where is Frédéric? He's not here. Why? Sick. Possibly. Frédéric is sick. All right then. We're all going to... write a letter- Very good, Karen. ... to Frédéric. We're going to say, "Hello, Frédéric. How are you? Are you sick?'' Who's going to write that? Are we done? What do you need? What do you call that? A stamp. A stamp. Bye-bye, Frédéric! What's the matter, darling? You didn't do it? Florent, it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter. Don't cry. Did you write? Did you write your name? So it's all right. Don't cry. Karen didn't do it either. Okay? Let's go back. Careful! The rent? 3,7 00 francs. Rent and heating... and service charge: 3,7 00. Rent, heating and service charge. Everything included. And the water? That's up to you. Up to you. You pay for what you use. You pay for what you use. You use water, you get a bill. Lend me a pen. You pay for the water you use. The water... is not included in the rent. it's separate. On top. For the bathroom... to heat the water, a water heater. Water heater. Understand? Here we are at the end of a term and the end of a year. We must talk about the children's results, their progress... and next year. I'm going to start with Florent. I'm addressing the parents first. Mathematics: good. Speech rhythm: Florent is more at ease. Reading: very good. Spelling: very good. Vocabulary: good. He's made a start at conjugations. Conclusion: an excellent term! Next year he won't have any problems. it'll be a nice change from those mornings... when he was very unhappy! He is very pleased when I give him a kiss. Frédéric. Where are his parents? Not here? I can tell everyone who is here this morning that Frédéric has made a great deal of progress with his behavior. He exceeded what we were shooting for. it's going better. You can talk to him. He listens. Now for schoolwork. He's made progress at mathematics. Very good. Frédéric is doing very good and applying himself. He has now truly become part of the class. He's made astonishing progress. And now... Anh Tuan. Stand up. Here's a gentleman who doesn't work hard enough. I am not pleased! You're not working hard enough. You must try harder. But at home, he always does his work. I think Mom watches over him. So we'll give him a little something all the same? Yes, I think so! He's smiling. - But remember what we say. - Come around. Thank you. Say it properly. - Madame. - That's good. And next year- He'll be with the big boys! Reading: good. Oral expression: good progress. Mathematics: still some difficulties. A very good term. Abou needs to talk more at home. At home you need to talk with Mommy and Bahia. You must talk. You can. Okay? Thank you, Madame. Very good, Abou. Well done, Mr. Abou. And now Tomo... who has often squatted in my office to finish his work, which he didn't always do. I'll give you an example of his casual attitude. He even came in one day with some firecrackers and a lighter. - They're at home. - Yes, at home. Now you say that. But overall everything is all right. I hope that next year will be even better. He's certainly able. He has made terrific progress. He's going to take away something which was confiscated in my office. His Game Boy. Shall I give it back? But I'll keep the firecrackers as a souvenir. When there's a new arrival in the deaf community, he's always given a name sign... which expresses one of his particular characteristics. For example, when I was a child I was very thin. My friends at school called me " Skinny." I'm grown up now and I've filled out too, but my name sign will stay with me for life. it's like a passport.
