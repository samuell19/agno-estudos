He's on his way. I don't think this is cool. You just lead him inside and we'll get him. He's never done anything to me. Why are we doing this? 'Cause it'll be funny as hell! Everybody knows Chauncey has a crush on you. It's the only way to get him here. Hot dog, please. We don't have to do this if you don't want to. Derrick, you might be my sister's boyfriend, but you ain't her dad. It'll be hella funny, right? It's just a prank. And plus, everybody knows Ch... Ch... Chauncey is sp... sp... special. You mean retarded. What if we get caught? You know, sometimes, Miss Ghetto Goody Two-Shoes, you make me sick. It's Chauncey! Everybody clowns him! Come on, let's do this. Hide, fools! Hi, Lisa. What's up? Can you help me find my kitty? She ran into this house, and it's dark in there. Anything for y... you, Lisa. I think my kitty's around here somewhere. Chauncey, run! Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. - Chauncey. - No! Amani? No, please wake up! My sister... Is she dead? I... I... I... I didn't mean to. They'll lock us up for this! Not me. I saw Chauncey do it. Chauncey did it. Chauncey did it. Chauncey did it. Chauncey did it. Chauncey did it. It's either him or us. Wait, wait, wait a minute! He didn't hurt nobody. He would never hurt nobody! Don't to this! Don't do this! Please! Please, don't take my son! He's all I got! Chauncey! You gonna pay for what you did, boy. I can't stand bullies. Put him in the car. I'm gonna get you! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Get away from my door! I ain't got no money and I ain't buyin' nothin'! I done told you to get away from my door, now. Chauncey. Oh, my gosh, Chauncey! Oh! I'm so happy to see you. Chauncey, my gosh! You look... Come on in here, boy, and let me wash you up or something. Get in here. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. I'm gonna get you! You been taking your medication, right? Yes, Momma. Okay, come get something to eat when you're ready for school, okay? You still haven't found a dress you like for the homecoming game? You know you just got two more days left. I don't even know why I'm bothering. It's not like I'm gonna win homecoming queen anyways. Lisa, you are just as qualified as any of those other girls they got nominated. Oh? I'm not as popular as most of them, I'm not the prettiest, and I'm certainly not the richest. First of all, you are gorgeous. And you got something that money can't buy. You got a good heart, baby. And that's worth more than money or looks any day. Believe that. I got something for you. Your daddy and I want you to have this. Momma, I can't. Oh, yes, you can. Would you stop yelling from the bathroom like you James on Good Times? But, Momma, you and Daddy are struggling to make the bills. I can't. We may not be able to afford your college tuition, but we can afford to get our baby girl a new dress for her homecoming dance. You about to roll up there and be the queen of the ball. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome! You got that cutie pie Ty Reynolds rolling up there with you. Best wide receiver in the city. Oh, yeah. Your daddy said he could go pro. Ka-ching, ka-ching. Look, I told you guys, me and Ty, we're just friends. Mmm. I said that about your daddy too when we was in high school. You see what happened. Oh, college notification? It's from Spelman College. Oh, cool. Good morning, baby. What do they say? I got in. Yes! But, no scholarship. Oh, baby girl. Why you ain't text me back? Hmm? Who you been with all morning? I'll bet you it was with that bitch Lisa, wasn't it? For your information, you and I are not together anymore. So bounce. How many times I got to say sorry? You know I still love you, babe. Mmm. Is that why you cheated on me with the quarterback from Dorsey? Everyone saw you. It's all over Snapchat. How many times I have to tell you that I was buzzed? I got to get ready for school. Don't do this to us! There's no more us, Gina. Now let me go. Gina Brown! Do I have to call the cops again, young lady? This ain't over. Son, you got up to 50,000 views of your online receiving reel. Every college scout from Howard to Stanford's gonna be watching you this weekend. This your ticket out of here. Don't let these little hood rats ruin your future. Look, don't even worry about it, Pops. I got this. I ain't a hood rat! Yes! Stacked! Number one artist, hello! He will be here tomorrow in Big Boy's neighborhood. We're talking about on-air, all the way live. An interview right here at the station, and now, listen, this our first on-air interview with Unique, so be sure to tune in at 4:00 p.m. Now, if you in the I.A. area, then I need you guys to come on down and show up to the station and show some Cali love for Unique while he's hanging out in the neighborhood. Another day. I miss you, sis. I miss you too. Oh! Goddamn, girl! What the hell are you doing here so early, Eddie? Your grandmother told me she was hooking it up with breakfast. Okay, well, you know this whole thing of you being my boyfriend means you don't have to be a stalker. You hit me hard. Come on, you big baby, let's get you food. Check, check. This one goes out to all the real lovers in the house, and to my one special true love, I got one question... Will you go to homecoming with me? So wack. Hey, um... You wanna go to homecoming together? Oh, man. Baby, you, me, homecoming. Let's get this thing popping, girl. Boy, is that all you got? Come on, Mom, can I get some privacy, please? You get some privacy when you pay some bills. Now, hurry up, Mac Daddy. Don't be late for school. Yes, Mom. Let me see that. Oh! What? That ain't Dee, though. I ain't never seen you with her. She ain't never came outside... Wait. Hold up, hold up. What up, cuz? I'm late for school. Relax, cuz, we just gonna hold 'em for you. Come on, Eazy, I got to get to class, man. I like these. Oh, you think you something, you got your little soldier backpack on... What the fuck? I swear to God, I'll blow your head off if you've scuffed up my Chucks, nigga! You crazy or some shit? Huh? Hey, he must be. Check out his gear. Shit looks like it's straight from the Goodwill or some shit. We got a problem, nigga? This motherfucker's retarded. Let me chill out, man. I'm... I'm crazy today. Chauncey? Oh, man! Hey, get out of here, man. Get the fuck outta here. Filming this shit. With your skinny jeans. Hey, girl. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Compton High's homecoming queen, Lisa Walker. Aw. But I really don't think that's how it's gonna turn out. You never know. You better watch your back, or you just might not make it to the dance. Why do you always act like you're auditioning for Love & Hip Hop? Does that girl just, like, wake up with drama? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Ooh! I like that little skirt you got on, girl! Ha! Yah! Guess who is about to be at Big Boy tomorrow after school? Who? Unique! Oh, my God. Girl, he is so fine! I love his new song, "Hoochie Love." Yo, that song is mad corny, though. Like... Hater! - You feel me with this, right? - I don't know. Hey, hey! My peoples, what's good? So, yo, peeps, my parents are going out of town this weekend, so, you already know what time it is. Party at my crib. Pre-homecoming turn-up. You ready to get a little... How we get down! Whoo! Hey, you already know it ain't no party without D-R-E! What you thought? Dre, stop playin', nigga. You know my rules, no running in my schoolyard or my courtyard. Whatever. Get to class. Mr. Hurd a gangsta for real. Yeah! Guys, guys. I just saw... He's back... What? What? Yo, what are you babbling about? Calm down, Derrick. Who's back? Chauncey. Chauncey Page. I know you guys don't want to hear it, but I need you to read chapters six through seven over the weekend. Do questions one through five. They will not take you long. And now, um, it's time to pass out your midterms, and I am proud to announce that there was one A-plus in the class, and it went to Ty Reynolds. Thank you. Punk-ass teacher's pet. Do better on the next one. Have a happy homecoming weekend, guys. Derrick, I want to talk to you after class. Meet us in the lunchroom, okay? So, is there something going on that I should know about? What you mean? I mean the decline in your grades this semester. You have gone from an 80% average in this class to a 65%. How 'bout these percentages... The number one cause of death among young black men from 15 to 34? Murder. Ninety-three percent of murder victims are killed by someone who shares their race, and according to the CDC, last year, young black men from 15 to 34 were 10 times more likely to die of murder than whites of the same age group. So what? You're gonna tank your entire senior year and let the ills of the world determine your fate? My point is, my fate has already been decided for me. You done? What a waste. Ridiculous. Nonsense. You got five minutes? Look at all this. Hey, hey. Look, forget all that. You still DJing my party this weekend? Oh, man, you already know. Okay, then. Yeah, especially if Kim will save me a dance. Could we just focus on what's most important right now? Chauncey. Yo, you sure it was really him? Sure looked like Chauncey to me, man. I can't believe they just let him out like that. He killed my sister. Because of us. Hey, don't say that, okay? It was an accident. What up, bustas? Ty, I thought you wanted to meet, alone. Yo, Gina, Dre. Y'all got to check this. So? Who the crackhead? That's Chauncey Page, man. Y'all play too much. I'm out. He's not joking. I don't give a fuck! If Chauncey back in the hood and want to get at us for some old-school shit, trust me, I got something waiting for his ass. Yeah, well, keep it down, Dre. Chauncey got y'all actin' like some scared-ass bitches. Yo, shut the hell up, man. What? What you gonna do about it, pretty boy? Stop puttin' us on blast before I shut you up. Oh, so now your punk ass wanna act hard, huh? Better save that shit for Lisa's virgin ass on Saturday night. - Oh! - What's up, boy? What's up? Hey, hey! Get off me, sir! He hit me first! You kids go back, finish your lunch. You, let's take a walk, man. - You okay? - I'm fine. What are we gonna do about this? Nothin'. Mm. Now, that... that was sexy. Ah. So, you out of jail now, huh, killer? What? Sit down. I said sit down, kid. You know, I know your whole story, Andre Dixon. Mom's and Pop's both bankers. Bought a nice home out in Baldwin Hills. Real bougie. Here you are, actin' like you an Inglewood gangsta. You ain't no hard rock, boy. 'Bout as hard as my dick. So what? I'll still whoop your old ass. You know, when I got out of the military, I taught schools in Chicago, New York, Detroit... and I came across a lot of young thugs, like you. Tryin' to be a man before their time. You a man? Take your best shot. And I'm tired of you triflin'-ass, pants-saggin', weed-smokin' little Negroes tryin' to be hard. Your mama worked too hard for that bullshit, Andre. Do you know why? Huh? Do you know why I got to act hard? Do you? So I can walk down the street and not have to worry about a Blood or a Crip trying to kill me. Or some punk-ass police lookin' to kill me. Or a group of hoods tryin' to punk me. I have to act hard to survive. Young brother, young brother. This is how you survive, young brother. Right here. Can I go now? Yeah, you can go. I don't want to have this conversation again. Ladies, this dance sets the stage for all that the Compton High homecoming queen symbolizes. Nice. Put the crown on. Pride, beauty, honesty, virtue and intelligence. Now, if any of you feel that you're not capable of representing that, then you should decline your homecoming nomination right now. Okay. That's what I thought. Put the crown on. Okay, smiles. Personality, ladies. You're looking dead. Let's go. Energy, energy. Seven, eight. Hips. Hips. Hips. Perfect. Keep your spacing. Pose. No, you got to keep that final pose. Take it again, from the kiss. Seven, eight. Nice. Hips. Hips. You know what? Take five, ladies, while I get these fellas out of the gym. Let's go. Seriously? Gina, no. First one... Come on, let's go. You need to get in line. Fellas, we got the gym for 20 more minutes. Hello? Who's there? Hey! Ladies, stop! Gina, stop! Get off of her! Stop! Gina! Back! What the hell is this all about? She just came in and attacked me. Why? She thinks I stole her man. Is this true? Why, you want him too? 'Cause everybody knows you fuck seniors. Gina, get your stuff and get the hell out of here. Wait, what? No, and you're out of the competition. What? No, no, no! This is my shot! No. Goodbye. You bitch. Move! Lisa, let's get back to work. And you fellas, get out of here. Hey, you okay? No. Look, come here, come here. It's all right. Look, I got to go. See you later? Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey did it. Get in. We need to talk. Okay, um... I'll take this. Yo, what's wrong with you? Yo, can I ask you a question? What? You really think Chauncey back in the hood? I don't know. I mean, Derrick's the only one that's "seen" him. You ever, you know, think about that day? Sometimes. What, you scared? Of Chauncey? Hell no! Shit! Okay, cool. So then can we stop all this Chauncey gossip? Look, now, I know you got a serious beef with Ty. Oh, I can't stand that bitch-ass pretty boy. And I ain't got no love for Lisa. So, I was, uh... I was thinking, maybe we could hook up, figure something out. All right, then. But, uh, what about after this, you know? What if we hook up, someday? Ew. Don't get it twisted. Boy, this is strictly about vengeance. Ew, that's disgusting. Damn, $20 cash for a rock, man! Get the fuck outta here with that burrito! Hold up, I need to take a leak. Mother... What you doin', man? Hey, yo, beat his ass! Where's my... Oh, shit! How'd you get my strap? Hey, look, cuz, I wasn't gonna kill you, man. Come on, man, I wasn't gonna kill you. Go ahead, man. Squeeze that shit. Shit. I knew you was a bitch. Oh, fuck! Attention, students. The west wing will be under construction for the next two weeks. Our new west wing will be unveiled November second... Guess who. Oh. You look like you were up all night. I was. The nightmares again. I thought you said you were getting meds for that. They're not working anymore. Yo! Who wants to come with me after school down to Big Boy to stalk Unique for some hoochie love? She's gonna ask him to be her homecoming date and post it on the 'Gram. Unique? Kim, he is so corny! Eddie, you are so corny! That sounds like a plan, I guess. I love you. Yo, um... Y'all see what happened to Eazy Hicks on Snapchat? - No. - What? They posted him dead last night. Oh, shit. Now, I saw Chauncey in his face yesterday... You think Chauncey killed him? Maybe. Maybe one of us is next. - We should go to the police. - And tell 'em what? Because we lied on Chauncey four years ago, he's after us? Man, I can't live through this again. What? Are y'all for real right now? I'm the one who lost my sister. Can we stop talking about this? No police, okay? Fine. No police. I'll see you guys after school. Yeah, dig in! Dig in! Come on, now! Dig in! I'm sorry. You sound like one of those paranoid white girls in a scary movie. Boo! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I apologize. So... Have you actually seen Chauncey Page since his release? No. But my friend recorded a video of him walking down the street. A video? Has Chauncey Page made any direct contact with you or any of your friends since his release? No. But... Okay, so let me get this straight. Chauncey Page comes home... after serving four years in juvie, and the first thing he does is stalk you and your friends on homecoming weekend. Look, it's... Ah-ah. Ah. Chauncey did the crime, and he served the time. I can't just run around pointing fingers at people without concrete evidence, unless there's something you're not telling me. I did hear that Chauncey got into it with Eazy Hicks yesterday. The same guy they found dead on 30th Street last night. Wait, where'd you hear that? The streets talk every day, Detective. You just got to listen. Okay. I'll check him out, only if you promise me you'll forget about Chauncey Page and start enjoying your homecoming weekend. Huh? Deal. You look so hot. He's gonna notice you. Hey, girl, we waited, like, 30 minutes after school. Mm-hmm. We called, we text... Sorry, homies, I left my debit card at home this morning, and then my phone died after I took an Uber home after school to go get it. Mm-mmm. Girl, we had to give you the deuces. I told you, nobody is standing in the way of me and Unique. Okay? Yeah, man, that's messed up. Unique, I love your story, and the reason why I love your story is because it's one of those that "started from the bottom, now I'm here" type of stories. Yeah, yeah, and I ain't goin' back, either. - I heard that, man. - No disrespect to the hood, but if you really from the hood, you ain't never tryin' to go back. That's real. Let me ask you this, though. What about your fans that's still in the hood? Man, I say, uh, I made it out, so you can too. True story. And if you a little lady, you know, I'll come get you out for a little bit of that, uh... Yeah, boy. And they have females that just ran up here to see you today too, man. Hey, man, come... come see me. What that feel like? Hey, it feel good. I heard... I wouldn't know what it feels like, man. You know, I don't have... Well, sometimes the parking attendant meet me out in front, but other than that, you know... Word! See, singers, y'all get that, man. I been doin' this radio thing, brother. I don't have what you have. You know? You know, we just got to let it do it... I would make an album, but I can't sing and nobody would buy it. My bad for how I was acting earlier. You know, news about Chauncey, it just got to me. Can we just please stop talking about Chauncey and just focus? O-M-G. - Oh, my God! - I love you, Unique! Oh, my God! Yo, babe. Where was you when I was shootin' my first video? Can you show me some hoochie love, Unique? Why don't you show me what you workin' with? All right, damn, girl. But check this... About to hit the studio. You wanna roll? Oh, my God, yes! Yes! Okay, wait. Wait, wait. How old are you? I just turned 18 last month. Cool. All right, hold on, I just have to say good-bye to my girls real quick. Deuces! Ha! Oh, my God. What just happened? 'Sup? Hey. You ready for this epic party? Right now I'm just thinking, "Will I ever get out of here?" What, you still worried about Chauncey? Maybe a little. Listen, let's just... let's just try and have a good night tonight, okay? I mean, I need a break from reality just for a few hours. Is that cool? Okay. All right. Come into my homeboy's party. Mm, sorry, bae, I don't do hood parties anymore. Mm-mmm. Well, look, I don't give it up on the first date. But... But... if you take me to my homecoming dance tomorrow, we'll see what happens on a second date. Me? At a homecoming dance at Compton High? Yeah, I don't think so, baby. Come on. The internets will love it. Worked for Drake when he took that 'Bama chick to prom. Got, like, a million views. Sold a million records too. Yeah, let's do it. Okay, look, just you and me. No bodyguards, no security. It'll be like a real date. Yeah. All right, superstar. Yo, hurry up, I got to take a piss! Hey, yo, I swear, for a moment it felt like I forgot about the game tomorrow. Don't sweat it. You got this, remember? Right, right. All right. 'Sup? Hey. You wanna hit this? Come on, hit this. Okay, maybe just a little. Damn! Excuse me. Sorry. Yo, Ronny. What's up? Why you all up in my girl's face, huh? Stop. We're out of here. Tiffany, let's go. What? No. I'm not gonna let you ruin my last homecoming weekend. If you want to leave, you can leave. Hey, come get this for me, man. Man, get him out of here. Look, just go. - Shut up, man. - Just go. I'm gonna get you, Ronny! Girl, I cannot believe you just dissed Eddie like that. Ah, who cares about Eddie? Girl, you know Ronny is looking good! Go on, girl. Yo, listen up. So, I'm gonna slow it up for the real lovers in the house. Hey, you wanna dance? Mm-mmm. Derrick, I am not feeling this right now. Hey. Hey, this one's for the 'Gram. Fuck! Go after him! Come on, I'm right here. Where you at, motherfucker? Where you at? Huh? Where you at? - Yo, Ron, yo, what's going on, bro? - No, no, back up, man. - No... - Where you at? Listen, just chill out, man, before somebody get hurt, bro. Ronny, put the bat down. Please? Boo, you should not be drinking if you can't handle your liquor. Ronny, Ronny, just relax, okay? Come on, let's just go inside. - Okay? Come on. Let's just go back inside. - Go on, dawg. Damn, my phone. Yo, they the last two. Don't let nobody else in. Nobody! Gangsta's in the house now, girl! Hey. Hey. What's good, bro. Ronny said can't let y'all in. Now, what? Oh, no. No, we comin' up in this bitch. 'Scuse me. Fools actin' scared over a cap gun! All right, come on, let's go. Let's get out. I have to get a scholarship somewhere, even if it's partial. I'll work three jobs if I have to, but I got to get out of here. Listen, if I get that scholarship and go to the NFL, I'm coming back here and I'm gonna get you. I swear. That's sweet, Ty, but I can't depend on that. I just feel like if I don't get out of here after we graduate, I'm gonna be stuck here forever. It seem like everything in the world is trying to keep us in the hood, and we all just tryin' to get out. Yeah, before it takes us out. Look, I would never let anything happen to you. Ever. Say goodnight, Lisa. I had better get inside. Yeah. But I'm gonna see you on the field tomorrow. Okay? Mm-hmm. Good luck. Thanks, homie. You know, Dre and Gina some haters. I'm sorry they ruined everything. It's all good. But, um, thanks for walking me home. It's all good. Wait, Ronny, um, this is happening way too fast. What about Eddie? What about Eddie? Huh? Um... so, why'd you run out into the street with a bat, anyway? I don't... I don't know, I was just... I was faded. You know? Okay, um... So, text me when you get home? How am I gonna text you? Broke my phone in the street. You saw it. I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right? Save a dance for me? Wait, you don't have a date? Come on, why would I bring sand to the beach? I'll be waiting on you, all right? Can't wait. Come on. Oh, shit. Whoo! Listen up, gentlemen. Now, half the game's over. And what that means for many of you, it's your last half of your last homecoming game! Now, how you wanna remember this day 20 years from now? As winners or losers? Winners! You're goddamn right! That's why we gonna keep throwin' the ball to Ty. You're the golden goose, son. I got this, Coach. Now, let's get out there, get the victory, and secure your future as winners! Now bring it in. On my count. One, two, three! Compton High! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, now. Hold on, son, hold back a minute. I want you to take a minute and focus, and visualize second half. Yeah? Yes, sir. I got this. I got this. Oh, shit! Easy! Easy! Hold it, hold it, hold it! What happened? My ankle! I said focus! My ankle, Coach! Easy! Easy! Chauncey. You home? What the hell you want? I'm Detective Raymond Johnson, ma'am. - I just want to ask your son a couple of questions. - Nigga, I know who you are, and unless you got a warrant, you ain't got the right to come up in here and ask my son a damn thing. I just want to know his whereabouts last night. He been with me. He just got home, and he been with me every minute since his release. Now what? You sure about that, ma'am? Don't question me, Detective. My son done paid his debt. He done paid his debt to society. Now, unless you have a warrant, you need to get the fuck up off my property! Chauncey. Word on the street is, you had an altercation with Eazy... Leave me alone! You heard him. It's cool. We'll talk later. That's right, slide your ass on back down to the pigsty, pig-ass pig. Welcome home, Chauncey. Bacon-wrapped bastard! You just got home, and they fucking with you already! Can't stand them motherfuckers! Come on in here, Chauncey! Lisa, your homecoming date is here! Oh, thanks. Oh! Oh, wow. You look amazing. You don't look too bad yourself. Thank you. How's your ankle? Uh, team doctor said it is a slight sprain. I'll be out for six weeks. Now, Ty, tell me again, how did you hurt yourself during halftime? You know that's like getting fired on your day off, right? Uh... I... I slipped. Daddy! Can't you see he's already upset? No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. You'll have another chance, right? You ready to go? Yes. I don't condone this, son. But maybe you better take these, just in case. Look, I know she lost her twin sister and everything years back, but I've heard nothing but nasty things about that Kim Morris. She's not like that, Mom. She's innocent. Yeah, well, she don't look innocent. I miss you so much, sis. It's okay. Just make this a night to remember, for the both of us. Damn. You look... caliente. What is that? Seriously? This is our last homecoming. For once, I wanted to ride in style. Girl, you lucky we ain't takin' the Metro. Come on. All right, let's get it, baby. Oh, shut up. Jesus! So it's gonna be like that, today? Gimme that money! I got you! Boy, get your dusty-ass fingers off my car. I work two jobs for this! All right. I thought I was coming to get you. I decided to save you the extra trouble of driving up in them bougie-ass hills It's like you're ashamed of living in Baldwin Hills. Well, living in the hills is overrated. Besides, how am I gonna keep my street cred if I don't walk these streets? These streets are overrated. Don't you think you're a little underdressed for the dance tonight? What? I thought we was gettin' rowdy tonight. Although, for real, though, uh, you look lit. Thanks. Now let's go get gangsta. Damn, Gina! Ooh, look at them, Chauncey, goin' to their homecoming dance. This is your homecoming too. Come on, let's celebrate. Wait a minute. Where you goin'? Come on, now, Chauncey. Give your mama one dance. We gonna celebrate. Come on, boy. What's wrong with you? What, you too good to dance with your mama? What, you judgin' me? You think I'm a drunk? Oh, you mumble-mouth muthafucka! You ain't never gonna be shit! Kill me! Kill me like you killed that girl! Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey! Kill me! Where you going tonight, Chauncey? Don't speak right now. Come on. Seriously, we came in that? Hey. Hi. Oh, you look so good! Look at you! - You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Hey! - Hey! Unique! Yo! "Hoochie Love" is my joint. All right, I got that on repeat, homie. I thought you said he was corny. Shut up! Where's Ronny? I thought he was supposed to come with us. Man, Ronny probably still drunk from last night's drinking. Wait, what? No, he said he was gonna meet me at the dance. What? Uh... No. Uh... I meant, meet us, meet us here at the dance. Fuck Ronny! I hope Chauncey catches his ass on the street. Eddie! What's up with you? I don't want to get caught up in no hood drama, okay? Why don't we take a walk in the park before the dance, okay? Ah, hell no! - I wanna roll in the dance with... - my boy Unique. Unique is my date, not yours, Boo. Calm down. Babe, we need some private time. Oh. Private time? Mm-hmm. - I'm gonna catch you guys, uh, later. - Come on. Just make sure you guys get back before they announce the king and queen, 'cause, um, I really need my crew for support. Girl, you know I wouldn't miss it. We got you. Do you? We're going in. Yo, yo, yo, homecoming is lit, y'all. So, check it. I wanna give a shout-out to two of our homecoming nominees. We got all-state wide receiver, Ty Reynolds! Who would have won the homecoming game if he hadn't have injured himself at halftime. Mmm. But, we got my homie, Lisa Wa... Oh, my God, is that Unique? Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Hey. Do your thing, superstar. "Hoochie Love"! DJ, cue it up and, uh, clear out. So, check it out. I want to give a shout-out to the hoochie that came here with me today. What's up, baby? Kim, I thought you were gonna save me a dance. How could you play me like this? D! I was not about to pass up a date with Unique. I mean, he's a real superstar. You are just a friend. I understand. Derrick, you okay? No. No, I'm pretty fucked up. I want you... now. Yo, I thought we was gonna get nasty in the park, and then you're telling me you want to break up with me after homecoming. We're just on two different paths, Eddie. It's Ronny, isn't it? Oh, my God. This has nothing to do with Ronny. Okay, then what the hell? What are we... Okay, look. Eddie? Okay, stop playing. Eddie? Oh, shit! No. No. No, please. Please! No. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? Please don't! Please, please! No! Hell yeah. We make a pretty good team. Fo' sho'. Hey, uh, you sure you still wanna go to the dance? I mean, I think we could have more fun on our own. We could do that after. Well, how 'bout just one kiss for right now? Damn! I think I'm in love. Slow down, girl. Oh, I got to take this outside. It's business. No! When you come back, can we go for round two? I'm down for that. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's go for five minutes next time. You got jokes. Watch your mouth. I'm comin' back, all right? All right. Hello? Yeah, hold on a second. Hold on. These ladies worked so hard every single day to get this routine. I am so proud of you.
