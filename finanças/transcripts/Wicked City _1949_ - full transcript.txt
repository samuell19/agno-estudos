And remember... no funny stuff this time... If you're not back here by 6a.m... we're putting out for Naples without you. If we're not back ...you can keep my green bathrobe! Don't worry, we'll be "? la nage". What do you mean..."? la nage"? Swimming! I want to find out where the main drag is. Oranges? You want some oranges? Give me three. How much? 30 francs. Is that enough? That one... lot of money! Keep it. Gee thanks. Hey sonny, is the Canebi?re near here? It's at least an hour away. - Hey, Matt! - What's he say? 1 hour's walk... Let's go! You fur-trappers always want to walk. Me... I want the BMT! Will that tram take us there? It'll take you to the Old Port and from there the Canebi?re goes on for several kilometres. Thanks! See you! Lovely, really lovely! Waiter! Go ahead Eric, you're the one that speaks French. We're in town for a few hours this morning. Where can we find some women? Yes, cute little women! Where? Cute little women everywhere around here. "Cute little women EVERYWHERE around here!" They probably all got married before we arrived. Hey! You American? Yeah. I know what you're looking for. - Good liquor? - Yeah! - Hot music? - Yeah, yeah! - Beautiful girls? - Yeah, yeah! Come with me! Come on! Come on! There! Hostesses waiting for you! No, no... not there... 150 francs. Say, er?er? to me? - Don't worry, I speak French. - Great. We'll understand each other then! - How much? - No, don't be silly! Nothing at all... - Just have a good time. I don't care about money. - Hey, 10%! - OK. I want you to meet some old friends of mine. Oh, you're Americans... We'll have fun! He's not American... He was born in Brooklyn! Dance? What are YOU doin' out, after dark? Having fun! Hey! You're with ME! - Hey, I'm over here! - Yeah, right! Hell!... She doesn't understand a thing I say. Your friends are no fun. We can't understand a word they say. Why can't they speak French like everyone else? But you could say something nice to me. Don't move. Ah, someone who knows how to talk to women! Let's dance. Don't you want to dance? I dance too badly. Oh, come on. What's up? Her! Apart from that? Everything's fine! Excuse me. You're not going to leave me here alone?! Really! Thank you. You... ?want to dance? I'd love to. Here, mind this for me. Women are so sad? lost happiness. - What's your name? - Eric. - You dance well. - I hardly ever get to dance. That must be why. Damn... time for the entertainment. Do you? - Do you want to watch? - Let's go up there... we'll see it better. Thank you, my dear. And now, ladies and gentlemen... Here are our Caribbean Dancers! What will you have? - A whisky. - Make that two. And you, what's your name? Dolores. Dolores? A sad name. In my country there are a lot of sad people. - Spain. - Hmm, nearly. The Balearic Islands. You sure know your geography. - I need to. - Have you travelled a lot? Not enough! I always want to be somewhere else. That must be nice. - Water? - No, not for me. - To your love-affairs! - Oh, love affairs! You don't have any? Not for a long time. Aren't you happy here? Oh, I'm not hard to please, you see. A bit of sun... You're made for the sun... ...for the wind and the sea, like me... Not to hang around in nightclubs. You're funny! Why "tu" instead of "vous" with me? - Does it bother you? - No... But you're not like the other girls here... and you shouldn't talk like them. Have you learned how to judge women, in your travels? When you're knocking around all over the place, you learn a lot... ...and you're usually right. - You'd better be careful! Would you do me a favour... and call me "vous"? As you wish. Another whisky? No, come and dance with me. I like you when you dance! Don't worry, he'll be back sooner or later. I don't care. Do you? have any other friends? I'll fix you up tomorrow... come back. - You're strong. - Let's go. - Where do you want to go? - It doesn't matter... anywhere but here. And your friends? I'll find them tomorrow, when we've said goodbye. Now you're calling me "tu"! - So this is Marseilles. - The Old Port. - It's beautiful. - You think so? Yes, tonight... Marseilles is the most beautiful city in the world. - Where do you live? - On the other side. - Let's go. - Could we find a taxi? - We don't need one! - You're crazy! Here... I'll lift you... Don't be scared. I'm not scared. - Really? - You don't believe me? - You live in this street, darling? - Yes, higher up. - Do you live alone? - Yes, very much alone. - Me too, I'm very much alone. - You?!... You've got a girl in every port! - No, I'm more picky than my friends. - Really? Yes, I've never been in love, so far... I don't know why I'm telling you that. - You probably don't really care. - But you never know! - That's very nice of you. - Here we are! It's cold! It's cold! Go on... get going! Leave him alone! It's not fair. What isn't? That I have to leave. It's the life you've chosen. This morning, for the first time, I'd like to change it. You can find a one-night stand in every port of call! You might not believe it... but I'm in love with you. If you knew me better, you probably wouldn't be. No!... You have to get back to your ship. I love you. Give me a hand. I'm coming with you. No, you stay here. - You'd get lost in all these alleys. - No way! In this neighbourhood, you could wander round for hours... ...and never find your ship again. Come on, we'll get a drink somewhere. You will wait for me won't you? Yes, of course... Don't look so serious. You with me? Yes... Two cognacs. - How much? - 120 francs. I don't have any francs left, just dollars. Is $1 OK? Yes, that's fine. Thank you, sir. - Will you write your address in my book. - Of course. - Who are those guys? - Where? Behind you. Just a couple of locals. That stupid whistling! Say!...How many addresses have you got here? Here... Just yours left. They're still looking. If they keep it up, I'll smash their faces! No, ignore them. I don't like guys looking at you. You'll have to get used to it. To your love affairs! To the one I love! When I arrived in Marseilles last night, I bought a little bracelet. It's not much... But it's a good-luck charm. You won't believe me... about the bracelet... but I bought it for you. Liar! You didn't even know me! I imagined you, hoped for you, exactly as you are. In my cabin, I've got a whole bunch of photos of women... ...but they all look like you. I hope that it brings us both good luck... ...and that we'll be together again very soon. I'm going to miss you. Come on though, I don't want you to miss your ship because of me. As soon as I know my next port of call I'll write you. Yes, darling. It won't be for 6 weeks or so. There's that whistling again! I hope a rich American sailor will be generous to the poor people of Marseilles. - Don't do anything! - Keep out of it! Looking for trouble? Cut the crap!... hand over your dollars! And you saw nothing, heard nothing! Understood? Scram! Get out of here, you little? What's your name? Can you hear me? What's your name? What's your name? Eric. Eric? Strange name. Nationality? I'm Canadian. - Where were you born? - Quebec. What the hell are you doing here? I'm with the American Merchant Marine. Have you got your identity papers? In my pea jacket. We didn't find anything in your pea jacket. - Was I robbed? - We certainly got that impression. - Has the "Alabama" left? - Guess so... You've been here for 5 days. Tell me, were you with a woman? What's her name? Dolores. Dolores what? I don't know. Oh, I see. - What was she like? - Beautiful. That's a little vague. Brunette. Come on, small, tall, thin, fat? Beautiful. You've already said that. Did you go to a hotel? - No, to her house. - What street? I can't remember. She put her address in my notebook. We'd have to find it. It's gone with the rest of your stuff. It's a classic case... The woman gets you bumped off... We're not back in grade school. That's not true! I'm telling you, she was behind it. They're all the same... all whores! Not her! - A nasty story. - What story? - That sailor, last Saturday night. - What sailor? Don't play innocent... The one you ripped off. I don't make a habit of ripping people off, as you put it. Don't get cross... I want to help you. Don't you remember going out with an American sailor last Saturday? I see American sailors every night at the "Kit-Cat". Tall, fair... ring any bells? Tall and blond?... No, means nothing to me. Two guys beat him up, stole $250... You know nothing about it? - I don't know anything about it. - Yes, and I believe in Santa Claus! You're in league with them and you shared his money. Didn't you look at me? You really think if I wanted to steal money, I'd need help? Do you really think I'd need to share it with anyone? I don't need to take or ask for it... People give it to me! And you're happy to take it, right? No, actually, I don't accept it! What I earn at the bar is more than enough for me. And if I stay at the Kit-Cat and don't have a car or any jewelry... ...it's because I don't want any ties. I don't want to depend on anyone... I prefer my freedom to everything, even to money. You realise your friend Eric is in a coma? Right now, he might even be dead. Well, what do you know!... that seems to upset you. It's always sad to think some poor guy's about to die... ...even if you don't know him! Sure! By the way, he accused you. What of? He said he was out with a woman called Dolores. Here in Marseilles, every other woman's called Dolores. It's become fashionable. Want a light? - Show me your papers. - Why not? Here they are. Hmm... They're in order. It's just as well that the sailor hasn't laid any charges... You won't have to face him. But you'd better be careful... From now on, we'll be keeping an eye on you. And your name isn't even Dolores! - Do you have a light? - Here. So, this is the Old Port! What do you think it is... the Sacr? Coeur?! It's strange, I don't recognize it. Don't you? Well it doesn't recognize you either! The last time I saw it, it was so beautiful. Would you know a little street? I've forgotten the name? It's over there... It goes up and winds around. A little street that goes up and winds around? There's thousands of them here in Marseilles. It's like bouillabaisse... a speciality of the region! Thanks! There's our guy, if I'm not mistaken. Can't you read? 150 francs entrance fee. I just want to see if my friend's here. Get out of here! Can you tell me if Dolores is here? There's no Dolores here. Don't waste my time! Scram! You think you're tough! Wait for me here. Do you know the guy who just went out? Never seen him. Another dirty bastard trying to get in for free! It's scandalous! He wanted to see Dolores. Really? No luck there. Some champagne. I only drink champagne! You're quite right. Two glasses. No, a bottle... Otherwise they give you any old plonk! Plonk! I love to hear you talk, with your cute accent... Were you born in Spain? No, in a little country? far away from here. Don't tell me. Let me guess. I'm sure you're Sinhalese! No. I was born in Sucre. - Sucre? - Yes, the capital of Bolivia. - That must be charming! - Not really! Excuse me sir, but I'd like a word with Miss Dolores. Certainly, sir. Can't you see I'm busy?! It's extremely important... For you. Very well... go to my house and wait for me. 3 Mont?e des Accoules. I'll be there in 15 minutes. I'll be there too. Nothing serious, I hope. I hope not. Will you dance with me? In my country, we only dance at major events... ...baptisms, marriages and deaths. - Do you really want to dance? - No, not really. But promise you'll spend the evening with me. No, not this evening, I can't. Perhaps tomorrow. I'm sure that we have a lot to talk about. We have a saying in my country. What is it? "Time is money" Time is... That's charming! And if you wanted to visit the Riviera... ...I'd be honoured to drive you there. I'll think about it. Leave me here. No!? Won't you at least let me see you to the door? My neighbours have never seen me with a man. - Please understand. - Oh, I quite understand! My mother always said to me... "There are two fragile things in this world... ...a staircase and a reputation." I admire your dear mother... and I admire you too. A staircase? That's charming! Here's my card. Joseph Perr?... Please don't lose it. Don't worry. The neighbours! Charming! Your house is very nice... a delightful interior. A woman of taste. Tell me, do you remember a certain American sailor? Yes, I remember him. He's dead. - You really think so? - I know he is. There's nothing better than bringing good news! He's alive. - Have you seen him? - Yes, I've seen him. This evening at the Kit-Cat... looking tired... but alive. How come I didn't see him? I don't think he had the 150 francs needed to get in. Poor bastard! Poor bastard, maybe!... But he can look after himself. Sailors are pretty resourceful... They always end up finding what they're looking for. And what's he looking for? Victor, you and me. I didn't have anything to do with it, as you well know! Yes, I know. But as far as the police are concerned, you delivered him to us on a plate. To have him beaten up? To relieve him of his dollars. The stabbing was too much. In fact, I've already told Victor what I thought of it... he's too impulsive. And so? It'd be better if the American sailor didn't find you... ...and if the police didn't connect you or us to this unfortunate incident. It'd be better not to dump us in it... 'cos we'd dump you in it too. And that would be too bad! By the way... do you know Juan les Pins? It's a lovely little spot, cosmopolitan but relaxing. Take a little trip there. And don't forget that you're a foreigner. Not that we have anything against foreigners. It takes all kinds. However, we French are 40 million strong... ...and foreigners are something of a minority. They really need to listen to our advice. It's in their best interest. Understood? Get out! Juan les Pins? I envy you? the sea? palm trees? Get lost! Gosh, you speak very good French now! Congratulations! - If she keeps it up, I'll kill her! - Fine, go ahead, kill her! This needs to be certified, please. Come back later, it'll be ready for you. - Good morning. - You again! Yes. Did they find the woman who was with me? Find a woman in Marseilles! You must be joking! Did they find my dollars? You're still here! I'm here 'cos I'm flat broke. Even if you were French... ...we couldn't help you out 'til you'd been in town for a year. In a year, a person could be dead. That'd suit you! I don't make the laws. Count yourself lucky we don't throw you in jail. At least I'd eat there. We're not Le Mariel. I hope you never get stuck in a foreign city where you don't know anyone. That's why I stay in Marseilles. In any case, try being broke in New York or Buenos Aires. Not so funny! Go to the American consulate. Americans are rich. I was there. They sent me to the Canadian consulate. Then go to the Canadian consulate! I've been there. They sent me back to the Americans! - Then go to the soup kitchen. - Thanks for your advice. Someone will be able to do something for you. Yes, the funeral home. Those of you assigned to work detail 86... Go get your hooks. And hurry it up! Any work going? Are you in the Dockers' Union? Nothing doing. You finished listening in? Want a clip round the ear? Hey... mister, mister! Yes? Say, haven't I seen you somewhere? Don't think so. You looking for work? Me? No. Oh, O.K. Well if you ever need anything, I'll be at l'Anse du Pharo. Just ask for Pierrot. Everyone knows me. Right... I'll remember. You're strong. You dance as well the men in my country. - Where were you born? - Tierra del Fuego. I'm not surprised! You dance too well! I can't follow you now. - Dolores? - Hmm? - You really appeal to me you know. - Too bad for you! - Why? Are you really so serious? - It's my boyfriend who's serious. - Well, that can be fixed. - Thanks, I'll let him know. Do you have problems with your love life? Don't make me laugh! Love is just an infatuation... always causes trouble. And I don't like trouble. What's the matter? Oh nothing... Happy to see you having fun! So, why did you want to come back to Marseilles? Because the holidays are over. My mother always said... "It's when holidays are over, that they really begin." Your dear mother was a remarkable woman! Lunch break! Hey! Come and eat with me. Here. Take this and have a drink, it'll do you good -What do you think? -Tastes quite strange after oranges. - So, tell me... that's a living? - Well it lets me eat? eat oranges! One day, I'd like to be hired as a ship's apprentice. - You want to travel? - Yes. - That's strange. -Why? When I was your age, I wanted to travel. And find out what was on the other side. Me too... I wanted to be an apprentice on a freighter. But you're too young... No captain will take you on. I just need fake papers... I know someone who did it for one of my friends. - What about your parents? - There's too many of them. What? My mother and my father have both re-married... So there's four too many of them! What about you. Are you happy about your work? I'm a replacement... There's a story there. But it's fine, I'm rich now. Do you happen to know where there's a tattooist? There's one over there. Why? You see this? It's a wind rose, and I'd like to add something here underneath it. D-O... Do. What does that mean? Dolores. There's a Dolores in your life? You could say that! - Where is she? - I'm looking for her. - Is she lost? - I sure hope not! I don't want to leave Marseilles before finding her again. - Hey! - Well, don't move! When I get a tattoo, it won't be some woman's name. No? No, on this arm it'll be the names of all my ships... ...and on this one, all my ports of call. Tahiti? Honolulu? San Francisco? Have you ever been to San Francisco? - Several times. - I'd give anything to go there! You think it's that beautiful? Yes, with the mountains and full of trees? No? No... it's just like here... full of people. Could you ask him what he wants. I can't understand a word. Now listen, I've got the right to my story. What's the matter? Well, this fellow's been tryin' to rob us twice. Well, I think it's a scandal! Come and have a drink on the house and everything will be fixed up. Well, this fellow's a crook! No... not as much as he looks like! Well, what a joint! Come on Barry! So, you speak English. With that and my experience, we could earn millions. You take care of the foreigners and I'll take care of the provincials. - So, 50/50 you want to work together? - O.K.! Gentlemen! Where are you going?! [Speaking Italian] Poor me, sitting here. What am I doing here? What am I doing here? You're having fun! Your friend isn't much fun. You don't think he's funny? You, you're my brother. - The only person who understands me! - Yeah, sure! Where I come from, nobody understands me. No-one! And here it's even worse than there! Don't tell us your boring life story! See, she doesn't understand me! How come you understand me? I know about life! Oh, so that's it! You know about life. Come on, let's dance. Oh, leave me alone. I'm talking business. What were you saying? Oh, that I know about life. Oh yes, basically I don't! Suggest to him that he gets lost. And there is no one who knows the future... That makes me sad. Would you like to know your future? I must know... It's going to arrive any minute! That's true. Don't move! Waiter! Tell Tanya to come here and? Listen, I know the best gypsy in Europe. Not one of those knock-offs they have everywhere. A real one! A genuine princess who's fallen on hard times. Hard times? What kind of hard times? Don't worry, it happens to everyone. It'll happen to you too. Over there. Mr. Eric's table. Ah, my dear! Let me introduce Princess Mejine. A great artist. All-seeing, all-knowing. And sometimes, she tells all she knows. You, I'll tell everything... You're one of those men, who needs to be told all. Give me 1,000 francs. Thanks. See you later. I'm leaving you in good hands. Don't go! I'll be back. See, everyone leaves me! Even him... and he's my best friend. - I'm so alone. - May I? See this egg? It's going to free you from the Devil... ...who has taken the shape of a snake inside your heart. Thin as a hair, sharp as a dagger. Watch! Look, I passed it into this egg. Now you are cleansed! Yes, I feel cleansed! - She hasn't come in? - No, she hasn't been here for a month. They say she left Marseilles. It's a disaster for us. For you too? - She really hasn't been here? - I would've told you. - I know you know her. - Maybe she's sick? - So, you don't know where she lives? - Somewhere in the Old Port. The Old Port is pretty big. She's a strange girl, Dolores... She's not like the others. No, she's not like the others. Give me your hand. So?? Nothing. Thank you for that client... He turned out to be very generous. - What'll you have? - Same as you. 2 champagnes. So?? So what? What did you see in my hand? Hands don't count. It's all written is our eyes. What do you see in my eyes? You have never been happy. You've always been searching for happiness too far away. And now? You'll find a woman to love. But, again, you'll look too far away, for what's right under your nose. - Your champagne? - Thank you. No, that's not all. Why go on?... You don't believe me. I'm telling you to continue. Is it Dolores that you're in love with? Yes. I can see great danger. - I can see some blood? - Shut up! Don't throw me out? You can't throw me out? Oh you... I was looking for you to tell me my future! I just did 5 minutes ago! Sure, but it might have changed since then. Fine. Give me 1,000 francs. No, we're closing, sir. You should leave quietly. OK, I'll leave, I'll leave quietly. Goodnight. Who's this guy? What a character! Anything to eat? No, nothing left. Just a bit of ham. There's never anything to eat in this dump. Come on, I'll treat you. I feel like a sandwich. Good night. And how do you do that? It's very simple... I poke a hole in an egg with a needle. I put a hair inside and then when I break it in front of a client... ...the hair appears to come out. And where do you live? In the Madrague, on the edge of the city... Between the sea and the mountains. - Sssh! - What? Right! I think it's time to settle an account. Say, I think we've got something to talk about. What? I don't know you! Oh, we've met before! Don't you remember? Look out! He's dead! The police! Come on. - What's going on? - Nothing! - Where are you in such a hurry to? - I've got to catch a tram. - There are no trams this late. - No! Are you sure? Hey, guv... There's a guy who's been beaten up here. I'll get some back-up. You! Come with me! Why? I've done nothing! Let go of me! Let's go. No not yet, they'll suspect us. Let's wait. I can't leave you here alone. Let's risk it. Hey there! Did you hear anything? Nothing... Why? What's going on? Oh, some settling of accounts! Good night. Wait for me here. You seem to be in trouble. Like everyone else. You can stay here for a few days. He can sleep in the empty cabin up there... Go get it ready. Come closer. You can help us sort garbage. O.K.? O.K. Who's that guy? He's not one of us. He's in danger. You've got no right to bring him here. The chief said he could stay. What's it to you? I think you know. I'm free now. You're nothing to me anymore. - That man is not one of us! - Let go of me! I'd better not see him hanging around you, or you'll be sorry! You don't scare me. Do you have any papers? They're lost. You'll need some. Even here? Yes, even here. Not for me... I couldn't care less. The less I know about people, the happier I am. It's only that the police come here from time to time... And you know what they're like. What do you do? I was a sailor. - Your name? - Eric. We'll have to change that! What would you like to be called? I don't care. There was a guy here, called Hans... A sailor like you. - "Hans"... O.K. with you? - Why not? When are you going to sea again? Once I've found the woman I'm looking for. Be careful! Women are more dangerous than the sea! I know. But it's wasn't me! I swear on my honour. Finished making fun of me?! Think we don't know you?! Aim? Bouillon... December '38... armed robbery. December '40... Corruption of a minor. The month of December obviously inspires you. Because of the cold. You think we don't know you and Victor have been working together for ages? Sure, Victor and I were together that night... and some guy attacked us. I prefer to think that it was a settling of accounts between you two. But look at me, Inspector. Do I look like someone who goes around bumping people off? I'm no weakling, it's true... but I'm no Marcel Cerdan. No, I can tell you who it was. - It was an American. - What American? - Tall, fair. - You know him? Yes? No.. I know him by sight. He jumped us... sailors... you know. - Ah, so it's a sailor now. - Yes... America has sailors. Between us, if a guy like your friend Victor gets knocked off, nobody cares. But if the police don't find the guilty party... ...the press gets involved and starts to criticize. It looks bad. However, even with the benefit of the doubt, you'll get 4 or 5 years. But you can't keep me here! You don't have the right! - Unless? - Unless what, inspector? - This sailor? Would you recognize him? - Count on me! Well we'll let you go... for a few days anyway. As many you like, inspector! But I advise you to find him... or we'll have you again! - Understand? - Yes, of course! - 5 days. - Thank you, thank you! - Filipi, take care of this. - Thanks, I was sure we'd understand each other. - That's not heavy enough. - No, it's not very heavy. Just a minute. Pull it open. Now, it'll be double the weight. That'll change the way we work. What's it matter? Hey, Hans, the sailor... Trying to teach us our job now? Why not? - What's up? - Nothing. You don't like me being here? I don't like women bringing in people who try to take over. Leave women out of it! You think you're tough 'coz you killed some guy! That's enough! Any more of that, and I'll throw you both out! You, get lost! You've never done any work. Don't hassle those who do want to work. - We'll meet again! - Whenever you like! What are you thinking about? Nothing. Are you still in love? Why did you ask me to follow you? I want you. You're worthy of being a Roma now. What are you talking about? Do you know what being Roma means? It means being a liar! People have been treating us like liars for 20 centuries. Why? Roman soldiers asked the Roma blacksmith to make them 3 nails to crucify our Lord. The blacksmith didn't want to. He hoped to be able to save Him. So he said "I can only make 2 nails". So the soldiers chased him throwing stones yelling "Roma, Roma!" And since that time... we've been wandering the earth. Wandering the earth? That's the only life that suits me. Aren't you happy here? No-one's happy in prison. And yet, you won't be leaving. I'll leave when I want to. You won't leave. - It's in the cards. - The cards! Would you like to go back to Canada? No, not to Canada. What about your friends? They wouldn't give a damn about me! Eric Martin, the hothead that Quebec wasn't big enough for... ...is back and glad to be here! So where would you like to go? Everywhere. On all the seas, on all the islands... Forgetting this port of call through other ports of call... Forgetting this love affair... through other love affairs. You are beautiful Tanya and you're a nomad like me. Let's not kid ourselves... Roma... Do you want me to tell you your future? - I love you! - Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I know you'll make me suffer. You'll bring me bad luck. Do you like oranges? Not that much. Why? - Is your name Pierrot? - Yes. I'm here for Eric... He's run into some trouble. Serious trouble? He needs some fake papers. He told me? Yes, I know an expert. But I need photos of Eric. Here you are. He went to a photographer yesterday. Ask your friend to make an identity card and work permit for Eric... ...in the name of Hans Norgen. When you get them, bring them to the camp. Understood? Here's 500 francs... Can I count on you? - Count on me. Eric is my friend. - I know. - Good evening! - What are you doing here? I'll have a drink. Champagne. Does it bother you? - You should watch out. -Why? The cops are looking for you. It's not me they're looking for. I'm called Hans Norgen. I'm Dutch. Here. You think you're O.K. just with fake papers?! What else do you think I should do? Grow a beard? No I want you to go. Aim? will be here any minute. He's here every night. Oh he's called Aim?. Well! I never thought he'd be a snitch. He's already had the best of me. But I didn't know who he was. 200 even. You best go on the run. And what about Dolores? She hasn't been back. - Don't you have her address? - Oh, I've already told you. I don't know how I'll find her. And if I gave you her address... Would you go in to hiding? Promise. O.K. it's 3, Mont?e des Accoules... Now get going. I thought that would be it. Dolores! Dolores! You want to wake everyone up? You want me to call the police? Do you know when Dolores is coming back? Dolores? I don't know anything about your Dolores. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Waiting for me? You're really patient. I know what waiting's all about. It's no fun! Why are you home so late? Marseilles is very big, you can get lost. You get lost on purpose. So what? You've been drinking. Yes, I've been drinking. Anyone 'd think you wanted the police to catch you. It might be for the best. Do you want me to make you some coffee? I want you to get lost. - Eric! - Eric, what?! I never asked you to console me. I'm not trying to console you. I want to help you. Help me? Sorry but that's new to me. Why are you talking to me like this? Are you still thinking of that woman? Get lost! Get lost! Tanya. Don't be mad at me. I'm sick. We've been happy together. No. We will be again. No. No, it's no use. I don't want any more lies. I must be honest with you. Yes, you're an honest man. It's an obsession. I'm even wondering if she ever existed. Where's Eric? Up there. He's asleep. His old ship, the "Alabama", is in the harbor... Should I tell him? Why not? He'll want to go... Maybe not a good idea. No? On the other hand, it might be good, if he went back to America. As long as I go with him of course! I don't think he'll go back. But all the same tell him the Alabama is here. Hey, it's Eric! Eric Martin! Hey, Matt, look, it's Eric! Come on up! - Let's go see him - I knew he'd turn up. How are you? Good to see you. What happened? Did you get tanked up? You left with a babe. Why didn't you tell us you weren't comin' back? Well, you know how it is... I couldn't shake her! Boy, am I glad to see this old tub again! Where's your gear? Let's get it on board! Think I could sign on? Sure. We left two guys in Genoa. They're in the hospital. Go up and fix it with the new mate. Yeah, maybe it's about time I'm clearing out of here. - Oh boy! Great! - Now wait a minute, that's not the big problem. Listen... There's a kid I've got to smuggle on board somehow. A kid? Oh no... We'll never get away with it. Why? Half Europe's trying to smuggle away! Well it has to be done, so let's find a way. - Hey Joe, pick up on that slack a little. - Excuse me! Yeah, what'd you want? I used to ship aboard here, before I went to the hospital. You don't need an A.B. do you? Got any papers? Sure! Sure! Did you have nice weather coming over? Not too bad. Well I can use you if it's OK with the consulate. Meet the old man there about 4 o'clock, and he'll sign you on. Thanks! Gets your stuff here in a hurry though 'coz we're shoving off at 6. Don't worry! - You ready to leave? - Oh, yes! - You're sure you won't miss Marseilles. - Oh, no! - You won't get sea-sick? - Oh, Eric! - Even in a barrel? - A barrel? - I'll explain this evening. - Great! Come on... Let's get going on this! - A sweater. - But Eric, you already bought me one! - You'll need two. - Handkerchiefs too? I do need handkerchiefs. You can't blow your nose in your hand anymore. You must behave like a gentleman in the American Navy. - It's her! - Who? Dolores! Take this and pay. Don't worry, you'll catch up with her at the next port. Here's your change. You want to go to her house? - No, not now, we don't have time. - You sure? No, we have to see about the truck, and the consulate... ...and we have to get back by 5.30. You can search all you want. Everything's written down here. No funny business. It's all in here. And the Sanitary Inspection Certificate is over there. This car was last disinfected the 13/8/48. And the American sailor. Have you seen him? I haven't seen any-one... except the family of course. A false tip. We didn't find anything. We'll keep an eye on the camp for a few days. O.K. Goodbye. - So, you're bothering us for nothing eh? - Don't worry, inspector. A certain dame's back in town. If the American's still here, he'll be looking for her. You know what love is! - Eric! Eric! - Why 've you come here? - I have to talk to you! - Wait for me. Watch it now, it's number 8. Don't worry it'll be on the top deck... ...and we'll let him out just as soon as they drop the pilot. - Alright? - Are you there? They're going to pull you up through the air. Where will they put me? It's Matt. He'll know what to do. What about you? When will you come? Soon, don't worry. What's the matter with you? You're talking to yourself. No, I was singing. Anyway, well anyway? Get moving with these barrels... We don't have any time to lose. - Ouch! - Who yelled out? I did... I didn't think there was anything in it. No danger of it exploding. Do you think it's champagne? No it's wine. But it's 12 years old. So here we are. Yes, here we are! Did you find your friend? And your ship? Are you leaving? It's funny. I was wrong. The sea is taking you back. But I prefer losing you like that. Perhaps you'll be happy. You've been good for me Tanya. Because I love you. And now, I'm abandoning you. Don't wait for me. I won't be coming back. It was time for you to go. The police came to look for you in the camp. - Did they? - Aim? was with them. He's determined to get me. Poor bastard. Will you have any good memory of Marseilles? Yes, Yes I will. I'll just ask you one thing Eric? Think of me from time? Think of me from time to time! I don't want you to see the "Alabama" leave. Go away! Go away! You again! Yes. Running after her isn't worth the effort. Isn't she in? No. But she's back in Marseilles, I saw her. Yes. She just dropped off her bags, and changed. Do you know what time she'll be back? Oh, you're asking too much! She's not in the habit of coming home early. What time is it? 10 to 3. - Good evening, Max. - Well, you're back? - Yes. How are you? - Not bad. - Some champagne. - More?! Haven't you drunk enough this evening? Not at all!... You want me to drink pomegranate juice? Pomegranate juice! You're so very charming! What are you thinking about, my dear? About Juan-les-Pins. It was so peaceful there. Dolores! Good evening. Good evening. What were we talking about? I hope I'm not disturbing you. You can see that I'm busy with this gentleman. I'm sure the gentleman will understand. - Is everything O.K? - I don't like being forced to dance. I didn't have to force you the last time. You're not saying much. I have a headache. You haven't been in Marseilles lately. No. - So, did you have a good trip? - Excellent. And you're not going to ask me if I've been travelling? - Have you been travelling? - No. So, why did you want me to ask you? Because I really should have been travelling. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Do you remember me? - Yes. Do you remember the Old Port? The little bistro where we said goodbye? Yes, very well. And my name... Do you remember it? You'll have to excuse me... I have no memory for names. Hans. Oh yes that's right, Hans. Right! What are you laughing at? I'm thinking of what you'd promised me. What did I promise you? To wait for me. And live on love alone? I've already tried that.. It's not for me! - Get lost! - What's up? Leave now! Aim?'s calling the police. Go through the kitchen. Get out of here! Who do you think you are?! Do it for me, or they'll close us down for 6 months. - Come on! - What?! Follow me! Are you crazy? Dolores, I'm asking you to come with me. Leave me alone! You bitch! What an evening! Dolores? You weren't very nice to him, you know. So what?! Do I have to go soft on all my clients? No, but that one is different. He loves you. Too bad for him. I'm sorry. Who was that young man? Oh, just a client of the Kit-Cat. Well my dear, it's getting late. I hope you'll excuse a man... ...with much to do tomorrow... this morning in fact. Let me take you home. If you like. Dolores? Now you're back, will you be in regularly? Looks like it. - Do you want me to, yes or no? - Yes! - Well let's go! You got here too late... He's got away. That's the second time you've called us for nothing. But I know where he is and this time he can't escape. I'm warning you, he'd better not. It's not nice of you to shut the door in my face. I don't let anyone in here. Since when? Get out, or I'll call the police! Go ahead! Everyone's calling the police tonight. Leave me alone! Don't hurt yourself... I'm strong... Remember? That was the first thing you said to me when we met. Finally! Do you have anything to drink? You're already drunk! Oh, just a glass or two to get going. Have a drink yourself. Let's have a good evening, you and me. Help yourself. Hans. Hans! You'll finish that glass... and then leave, won't you? Did you ever know a guy called Eric? Eric? That rings a bell. I must have known one... or read about one somewhere. I read a lot of crime novels. Was he a criminal or a victim? I don't know... Perhaps both. That's true... You can be both. Now, you'll leave won't you? Yes... - With you! - Don't talk nonsense! Dolores... Think for a minute... You don't want to leave with me? - Where? - Anywhere. I prefer Marseilles. But I can't stay here. Well then, get lost! Not without you. No, but really, how would I live? I'll earn enough or both of us. - You shouldn't laugh. - Why not? I'll have to kill you. He must be at her place... There's a light on the first floor. Get your men in place... We've enough time. Get into position. But what do you accuse me of? Having the profession that I have? It's not easy you know. When you're broke, it's really difficult. All the others forgot me as quickly as I forgot them... Perhaps even more quickly. It's the first time... I didn't know how much it could hurt. You're crying. Two minutes ago I would've believed you. I really wanted to... ...but now it's too late. I'm Eric! and I'll never forget you. But look how you go from laughter to tears... - Whatever the client wants! - No, it's not like that! A client that's what I was to you. That's not true! You threw my love away. Some love! Because of you, I killed a man. Oh, it's not difficult, I assure you! - Don't talk like that! - I should've sailed... With a kid, who's my only friend. But I didn't... because of you! I could have stayed in the camp, with a woman who loved me... - But I didn't... because of you! -No, I beg you! I've ruined my life... because of you? you? you! - I'm not free. - Help! It was all for nothing! Listen, Eric, listen! I love you! I'm thinking of you! You're lying! Believe me... Have faith in me. You're lying! I love you! You're lying! I love you I... You're lying! Is the other door being watched? Yes, boss. There's no danger of him escaping. Watch out! You didn't need so many here. Are you Eric Martin? Yes. Do you admit to having killed Victor Leblanc? Victor Leblanc? Yes! Let's go! Now you have to pay for it, you poor bastard! Yes... It's funny... Now at last I feel free! Take a look upstairs. Come with me! It's all over for you.
