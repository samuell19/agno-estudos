Or cow methane or God knows what, eh Lily? [Female Radio Host] You bet, Lar-- [Car door opens and closes] [Cigarette lighter flicks] It probably won't surprise you to hear that this wasn't what I pictured when I decided to become a thief. You know, I imagine myself roaming the globe with an all-star team of criminals stealing rubies from shieks Cracking safes in Shanghai and then counting my millions on a beach somewhere. But before I knew it, instead of the hula girls and the mojitos, I was here, working alone, freezing my ass off Trying to steal something from a house while the cops were already inside. And if I didn't pull this off I'd lose everything. Sure I'd make some lasting relationships in prison, but that wasn't my preferred option.

I had to build something bigger for my family, and myself. So I quit. And he actually let me. [Don] Gus, it's Don. We need to talk. [Gus] Now even though I was out, you do not ignore a call from Don. So I had to detour the whole family from a trip to my mother-in-law's birthday party to go meet him, and see what was up. Gus, you do not want to play with me today. I thought you said that you were never working with Don again. [Gus] Now I know what you're thinking here. But you'd be wrong. Diane didn't want me to go straight. She wanted me to be better at being crooked. Like any married couple we had our hopes, and dreams. [Diane] Honey, do you know what good husbands do? Hmm? What do good husbands do, darling? Good husbands bring home the bacon. Bacon! That's right, bacon! Well honey, I can't bring home the bacon if I've gone away for a long time in the big house. Don't go away daddy into the big house! I'm not darling. Well if you keep hanging out with losers like Don you won't have to get locked up to go away for a long time. [Gus] I couldn't really blame her for being pissed off. She was right. And for a long time now I hadn't been delivering on my end of the deal. I just couldn't seem to find a good score on my own. [Diane] If you smartened up you'd bring home the bacon. Ha! And then maybe, if you were really lucky, you'd get your sausage eaten. [Gus] But now looking back, it was stupid to even have talked to him. Hi Uncle Don! Bye Uncle Don! Hey kid! [Gus] Don had a way of prodding, finding your soft spot and then twisting. I got one minute, Don. [Don] What are you, on a date? Fifty-eight seconds don. Stegman. Stegman? The porn guy? Yeah, the porn guy. He stole something of mine. You're my best thief, I want you to go get it back for me. Well I'm not yours any more, Don. [Car horn honks impatiently] You know, she blames you. She blames you for me not making enough money. Can you believe that? It was your choice to quit the crew. Your mistake, not mine. Alright, what did Stegman steal? He broke into my place, took some VHS tapes. Security footage of that jewellery heist that went south a couple of years ago. It was just Stegman, so I sent Lars. [Scoffing] You called Lars? Yeah. They say, half a loaf is better than no bread. But what if the bread is moldy, and borderline handicapped? Lars was supposed to be my replacement. But if there was a school for thieves, Lars would've been the kid that took three years to finish the first grade. I didn't know anyone who actually paid for porn any more. But somehow Stegman was able to juice big coin out of it. So what? He was suddenly stupid enough to start blackmailing Don? And a bunch of criminals? Even Lars smelled something wrong here. But he didn't really expect to find Stegman already dead. Two slugs. Double tap to the chest. Clothes all over the floor. Shaving stuff on the counter. Women's shit all over the place. The toilet's backed up? [faint, muffled cry] [tense music plays] [Octopus] Lars... come to me... Feel me Lars... [Lars] Huh? [Octopus] Touch me. Come to me. Lars... Touch me, feel me Lars, come to me... Love me lars, love me! [muffled cries] Who are you? I'm just the actress. That dead shit in the shower, that's Stegman, Right? Stupid bastard. Who did it? I... I don't know. I was unconscious. Stay there. Stegman is dead? That's stupid. The hell? [safe lock beeps] [Screaming] Jesus Christ! Fuck! [grunting, groaning] Lars? Lars sucks. Well, now I can't even get in touch with him. So I would like you to go in. See if you can suss this out. Now? [Car horn honks impatiently] What? Give me your balls you jackass! Really? You, me, Sergei, Kruger. Jesus Don, it's been ten years since that clusterfuck. What happened? He's been blackmailing everybody on the tape. I'm surprised he hasn't called you yet. No, he hasn't called me yet. [Angela] Dad, we've gotta go. Twenty four Roanoke Avenue. I'm not doing this Don! [Gus] Come on doodle bug, we gotta hit the road. Give me that. [Don] Gus, it's best you do this. I don't have to best do anything, Don. [Gus] The thing about Don is that he never did something for nothing. He knows we can't get pinched for a ten year old crime. He knows I know that. Therein lay my worry. [Don] I got you. [Gus] I just couldn't see the angle here. And God knows, Don always had an angle. You said you'd be quick. Whyn't you just honk the horn some more? Yeah, keep it up smartass. Mom! I'm sorry sweetheart. And you smell like smokes. I only had one. Back me up, doodle bug! Just one, I counted! What is that? Hot dog! I told my mom you quit. I did quit. As of now... I quit. So you're not a liar. And we'll tell her I was in a fire! What kind of fire, Daddy? -A big one! And I saved a little baby! And I went back for a cat but the baby lived and the cat blew up. Let the cat live! Shitballs yeah the cat lives! And I'm the hero of the story! Okay, okay, you know what? Be a father and stop swearing at your daughter. What did Don want? Nothing. Yeah, that sounds likely. Uncle Don was sad. Sweetheart I don't want you to call him that, okay? Someone stole something. Hey, how do you know that? - I hear stuff. Okay, you see this is exactly why I don't want her hanging around him. If you had had successful partners, they would know how to make money and keep secrets from children. You're so pretty! And you're so ugly! You're so pretty! You're so ugly! And you're so pretty! And you're so ugly! You're so pretty! Okay okay okay stop that. [Upbeat musical interlude] Too fat. Too ugly. Too duckface. Way too emo. Oh she's perfect for you! [Don] Get your feet off my desk! I talked to Gus. He'll go. So he went? He'll go. What do you mean he'll go? He needs time to suss out the situation. Dad, why do you even like him? Have you seen him with his wife? He's totally pussy-whipped! I like him because he's not an idiot. What if he doesn't go at all? Do something! Try Lars again! [cellphone rings] Fuck! Fuck! [phone rings] [coughs] [Lars moans] [Phone stops ringing] [Lars moans in frustration] Where are we? We're en-route. No we're not! Yeah... It's called a shortcut. Gus... Gus I will completely lose it if you do this [Gus] Of course it wasn't a shortcut. Diane can be a pain, But she is not stupid She wanted me to forget Don and just move on But my gut was telling me something Something different This was the moment that I realized there was a real problem Sergei was no fool He was the muscle in Don's crew And when I saw him here, I knew... This blackmail thing... It holds water [window breaking] Massive bullet Probably fifty millimeter. But no holes in the glass [Lars moans downstairs] Hey! Help me Somebody help me Who's there? Hello? Hey, help me Hey... Help Shut up! Who are you? I'm just the actress [Lars] I'm so glad you're here man [Lars] My eyes are fucked man Hey, help me out man I help you Lars, come on Oh thanks man.

Help yourself [espionage music] [Gus] I am a carrer criminal Now. There are only a couple of rules that we live by Rule number two: Don't tell other criminals your business It protects you, it protects them Diane's grandfather taught me that. He was a legend in his day and he made sure Diane's dad was a proper thief too. Which has made my recent losing streak so much worse. I think the real reason Diane hid my profession from her family is that she was just flat out embarrassed [Diane] Ok sweetheart you remember what to say if anybody asks you what your dad does for work? [Gus] Russian spy [Diane] He's like an entrepreneur. He works with money [doorbell] Okay, here we go Hi mom, happy birthday Thanks darling You're late My fault Mrs. Stewart, you can blame me -Oh get in here Tell her about the fire daddy, tell her about the cat Oh I will, go on in Apparently we have a cat Well that's lovely Angela, I can't wait to meet him.

Now I've gotta make a phone call can you make sure your mom doesn't find me? Wait. First help me with my jacket She'll think you're being responsible in a fatherly way Are you sure you're my kid? Alright Take that off Alright. Now. Give me your hands Say a little prayer with me alright? Close your eyes and repeat after me Lord give us strength... Lord give us strength To accept the things that we can not change... To accept the things that we can not change And courage to change those we can... And courage to change those we can And wisdom to drink all the pain away And... what kind of prayer is that? One that's gonna come in handy one day, doodlebug Just you and me, sitting on a porch Dad? You're so pretty! Now go find your mom alright? [Gus] That right there is what this was all for. So we just wait? Theres a ticking clock dad Let me see that Where'd you get this?

[Gus] Jesus, kids always seem to have all the right questions It's like Why shouldn't you have your cake and be able to eat it too? I just wish I had all the right answers for her. Sometimes all I've got are questions myself. [Gus] Is this for real? I think so Lets see if I'm awake Ouch, you're supposed to pinch yourself! You sure? For god sake Gus Dr. Field said, positive steps Moving things forward -That guy's such a new age tool, you know that?

How's that work? Gus makes investments. If somebody has a good idea, Gus seems an opportunity Yeah.

Please, Shit, shit [Tense music plays] Hi Hello Stegman You are a greedy Nelly Where are the tapes? I was just trying to finance my film Aren't there bankers for that? Nobody will back me. Too long, Too complicated, Too many characters, Too many flashbacks Bad hero, bad reveal, bad structure, bad ending I gotta take my shoes off, grounding is important Hey! Okay look, it's a morality tale. There's an octopus and a girl and it's practically art And there's all these extra story layers Ugh I hate those No wait, wait, wait, I call it. The Octopus Comes at Night [Annoyed] Where are the tapes? They're beside the Shakespeare. [Evy] Hi Kruger Evy [Evy] Get inside [Snorting noise] Are you okay? Yeah, yeah I'm okay. I thought I told you to stay in the car? But the woman followed you and I followed her through the side window to find you. You did that? Well you're like a little ninja. So the last time we saw each other, you left me for dead I did what I could You didn't do enough. Put your gun down [whistling] Hey what's that? It's pretty Oh.

I'm rethinking Now get your hand right up in there... Yeah Now you gotta think about the long game This is a career. Sometimes the first steps are a little slippery. Gross So is this how you always saw yourself? What? Dying with a man like this. What? [Choking noises] Pull it Missed you Evy So I guess there's only one question left What's that? Can you get out from the inside? Bye Kruger Bye Evy [Under breath] Oh she's beautiful... This kind of life requires a skilled craft. One that can be passed on from father to daughter And I'm a good father right? Yep. I love you dad Yeah Yeah, you're a pretty good father. Hey and ah... Kruger? Done Good I got the cameras daddy! Good job Now. We came here to do something very important You helped, big time. But the key is to know when to skidaddle, and do you hear those sirens? Now's the time. Lets go Good job sweetie Hey kiddo, how you holding up back there? I'm fine actually. I feel pretty good. She's a chip off the old block I got you something It stinks That's the art What bout Stegman? [fake accent] Mr. Stegman? He dead! [giggle] You know Evy. You're gonna have to back us up at Don's in case anything goes squirrelly. What about that Sal and Jessie thing? Mum's the word on that. Where is mom, dad? We're gonna go get her doodlebug Once I change out of these clothes What about, these? Don't break those, okay. We've gotta take those to Don's Okay okay You're so pretty! And you're so ugly! And you're so pretty! And you're so ugly! Yeah! [Sal] That chloroform comes in handy dandy, she's like a dead fish. Should've fucking known it wouldn't be that easy to take out dad [Jessie] Yeah I guess so, But man I just wanted to see that old bastards face when they lock him up for good. [Sal] Ah fucking Stegman. Greedy little bastard, we should've never given him the tapes Those stupid freaking, backstabbing kids of mine And these are from Sal's gun [Gus] Today's shit show, first rate With Evy tied up And Stegman locked away in his panic room These miscreant kids scoured the place for their tapes and of course found zilch [Sal] Stegman is dead That's for sure [Gus] Right about then is when Lars broke up their party. Oh christ, is that Lars already? I can't get the bar out Come on man, we just gotta go, leave the bar. Come on lets go! It's your boys who set you up Don I'm sure you're not gonna be surprised if I keep these, safe this time How about my two little pricks there? Do you know where they are? Don't know Well I guess they'll make it home sooner or later huh? Come on dad, you promised me a cat That's right, I did. Lets go Oh. One more thing. Destroy that evidence, no second chances. Oh yeah, for real, I'll do it Insurance! [laughs] Motherfucker [Sound of gun loading] Bad boy Donald, [Evy] Shame on you I think you should give me those now Once, maybe. But not twice [silenced gunshots] [Gus] It's all by the code There's only a couple of ways to get yourself killed by someone like Evy, Betrayal is one of them So is making the same mistake twice Don says goodbye Bye uncle Don Time to go get mom Yes! [Upbeat music plays] [Gus] Hop on. Good girl I'm gonna have to get rid of this car Welcome back It was great mom, we did this thing-- [Gus] Shh! Angela. No What took you guys so long? We hit a few snags, it's all good. But what happened to the, uh... I know this seems a little unusual, but even though we said we were retired, We can still tap into our, what you might call our professional sides We? You know age has made me realize that family need to be handled Speaking of which, how did you get here? Yeah we have a car to get rid of Ethel? [Ethel] I got a guy down at the recycling yard, It'll be roofing for the Red Cross by tomorrow Uh, keys? Let's get back to your future There's a lot of experience sitting around this, uh, tea party Diane has told us about your recent struggles, And we were thinking that maybe, witness protection could be a very opportune next step in your line of business Well I do have a partner, Yes I know No a business partner [Concerned mumbling, tense music] Interesting This changes things [Sound of multiple guns cocking] Maybe for the better [Sound of gun safety switches being reset] Young lady, I've seen your skills, this includes you too Wonderful, who wants tea? I think this might be a good fit You bet. [Gus] It really was easy enough to end up dead, or behind bars. Retirees are the best in the business. Which is why they're retirees, and not inmates. [Lady] Thank you! Oh. Oh you're quick You're like a ninja Glad you've made the right decision, Works like this. You I.D. Kruger as the cop killer and we put you and your gentle family into witness protection. Charges of kidnapping a police officer, aiding and embedding a felon, threatening of a bomb, impersonating a police officer, leaving the scene of a multiple murder, dangerous driving, tampering with evidence... and all of the other serious crimes you may or may not have committed that day go away You have a lucky charm up your ass. [Angela giggles] You like hitting all the buttons don't you? Sometimes you just gotta break the rules dad. Atta girl Who want's steaks? I'm thinking we need a boat -A boat? Yeah a big boat [Gus] So there you have it. Whether it was the promise of a boat, or steak dinners, or my little apple that's fallen so close to the tree, Or my new lease on marriage, or my new partner, Or all of it all together. My best self was back Under the cover of witness protection we could steal and fence just about anything we wanted And we were completely off the cops radar New I.D. new home town I was back. [Hopeful music plays] Stay close kid, here we go I'm with you, partner [Gus] So, what's rule number one of being a thief? Aspire to retire. [Sound of power tools grinding metal] If I even tried to explain it, it would just sound stupid. [Silenced gunshots] ["In Hell I'll Be In Good Company feat. Rich Kidd" by The Dead South plays]
