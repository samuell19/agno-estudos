From humble beginnings to legendary award-winning journalist, Jaime Maussan has been trusted as the voice of the people in Mexico for more than 47 years. For the first time the audience will have access to the information of a UFO case That code we explain using the technology and knowledge we have on earth This case was carefully studied by our 60 minutes team and it turns out to be amazing and fascinating Joining us to talk about the UFO subject the specialist Arturo Garza Rodriguez director of Alternative UFO Good morning thank you for being in here with us Mr. Joel Sampayo climate, sky reports and skeptic. Good morning thank you for being in here with us UFO Specialist Jaime Maussan good morning In the mid '90s, Maussan brought the subject of UFOs to the spotlight. - Then I became the anchor and finally the director of this show that was on the air until 1995. From then on, I became involved with something that I thought was very important. UFOs. I know many people think that they are not important that they are an illusion or fantasy but I realized that many people had cameras at the beginning of the '90s and they were able to record the UFOs. And I thought that I had a chance with these evidences to change the way people think. Maussan has received the United Nations Global 500 Award, three times the National Prize of Journalism in Mexico, the Ondas Award for journalists in Spain. He was recognized at the Capitol in Washington, DC. Currently he is presenting "Third Millennium News" from Monday to Friday at 10:00 p.m. on national television. This news has set the standard for audience records for the channel a+ on several occasions. "Tercer Milenio" continues to be presented every Sunday on prime time after 22 years of uninterrupted transmission on Mexican TV. - I was not gonna be a journalist. I was gonna be an administrative worker for my father. He had a company and he wished that I was able to take care of his company. And I never thought that I wanted to be a journalist. Because 50 years ago, the journalist in Mexico were not very honest. They wanted money for everything they put on the TV or in a newspaper. And my father was a rancher, he had bull fights. He was also impresario for big bull rings. He organized bull fights. Even my aunt was a bull fighter. Then I was going to become one. But at the same time, my father wanted me to take care of his business. But in the last day when I had to choose my major, a friend of mine came to me and asked me what was going to be my future, what kind of major I was going to choose, business administration something like that. And he said, "Oh, that's boring." And I said, "Why?" Because it's just numbers, it's just in a closed place with no windows. And I said, "What are you going to study?" He said journalism. And I said, "Oh, you're going to be a corrupt man. You're gonna try to take money from people." And he said, "No, journalism is to change the world. Journalism is the possibility to create conscious. Journalism is traveling. Journalism is going into the open and reporting what you find." And I liked that. And I immediately changed my major, probably the best decision I have done in my life. Then I decided, but my father didn't like the idea. And at the same time, he knew that the journalists in Mexico were corrupt. And I said to my father, "I will never ever, Father, take any money from anyone. I'm gonna be a very clean and honest journalist." And I have kept that promise until now. I've been an honest man all my life. And thanks to that, I've been able to develop credibility. When I was a young kid, I saw the destruction of nature but I didn't know why I didn't like it. I knew that the animals were being killed, that there was a business doing with animals, that anybody could take an animal from their habitats and sell it. When I found journalism, when I found my real passion for life, I really started to try to change my world. And I was able to do it in many ways because I worked in television with the most important journalist in Mexico, Jacobo Zabludovsky, the Walter Cronkite of the US, a man that was very well known everywhere in Mexico. And I became very close to him, in many ways his right hand, even though I was a teenager. When I did my first report, I took my report to Cannes in France. I was just 19. And I received a scholarship from the US from an American university, University of Ohio. And I was able to finish my career there. When I came back, I started working in journalism to try to protect the environment, to try to protect the woods and the jungles. I was able to find the Monarch butterfly in Mexico there, the hidden places where they hibernate. Fred Urquhart, a Canadian scientist, he's the one who found it, I mean, he's the one who really tracked the Monarch butterfly. But he published his article in National Geographic. He never said what it was. My network Televisa asked me to go and find the place. It took us two years to find it, but we finally did. And I was able to present for the first time to the Mexican people the Monarch butterfly and I was able to get protection for the Monarch butterfly. Then working in "60 Minutes" in Mexico as reporter, I was able to get involved with the protection of the turtles. In Mexico, we used to kill the turtles in slaughterhouses. And thanks to my report in "60 Minutes," they were closed. We created laws to protect the turtles. And that's the reason why some of these species of turtles have now recuperated. I was able to do many things to speak about the climate change or the global warming back to 1986. I was able to speak about the El Nino current in '87 or the depletion of the solar layer in '88. We were just two journalists from all around the world who went with NASA to the North Pole to report if there was a hole in the North Pole, as the one that had been observed in the South Pole. They found that no, there was not a hole. It was a little bit depleted but we didn't have the same problem. Because of the currents are different in both poles. Anyway, I was able to be there with a German journalist and even the NASA people were amazed that they said a reporter, a journalist from a tropical country is here. Why the Americans, why the Europeans are not here? But I was very much involved in the protection of environment. And when I found that news, the Televisa allowed me to go and participate with NASA in these investigations back in January, 1988. And I was able to do many other things like, for example, to help the Tarahumaras in the Sierra in Mexico. They were dying of hunger and cold. And also in '88, '87, we were able to get thousands of tons of food for them with that report in "60 Minutes" in Mexico. Then I became the anchor and finally the director of this show that was on the air until 1995. From then on, I became involved with something that I thought was very important. UFOs. I know many people think that they are not important, that they are an illusion or fantasy, but I realized that many people had cameras at the beginning of the '90s and they were able to record the UFOs. And I thought that I had a chance with these evidences to change the way people think. Back in '90, '91, there was a total solar eclipse in Mexico, probably the longest or the second longest in the whole century, six minutes and 54 seconds. And people, many people in Mexico recorded the solar eclipse but some people got UFOs in the middle of their videos. And I thought that was very important. Hours later during the astronomical phenomenon on TV program 24 Hours with Jacobo Zabkudevsky Guillermo Arreguin's video showed a flying saucer which was silver color on the top side and dark underneath it seemed to be spinning and flew for several minutes over Mexico Days later, more videos appeared and this was the beginning of the most important UFO surge of the 90s and that it remains till this day But this also reignited Mexican culture of watching the sky Obviously other voices cried out that this was a misinterpretation images or that it was the planet Venus, However up until 2009 those voices have not presented any analysis or research to end the controversy What is clear for us is that this unidentified flying object was seen in different places of central Mexico which implies that this wasn't something imagined. Since the same object appears in most of the videos This video was seen around the world and has been presented in different TV programs. This solar eclipse began a new era of study and research of UFOs phenomenon in our country because citizens had in their hands the necessary technology to record those strange ufos which they could only talk about before or say, "I saw one". So, they know now how important video cameras are - I was invited to this program because I had done a report on "60 Minutes" about Billy Meier and people identified me. But as a matter of fact, I didn't want to go to this television show because I thought that UFOs were not good for journalists, that they were very risky and I shouldn't get involved with this. But my company, my network asked me to go to the show, "Y usted que opina?" And it was so successful that they asked me to go for a second time and I didn't want to go. I really didn't want to go. I said, "That's it, no more UFOs please." But this man insisted, "Please, this is the last time. Let's do another show because you know how many people saw these, millions and millions and millions of people. And I want to do a new one." And I say, "Okay, but this is the last one. This is really the last show." And I went there and I was able to find these videos that were recorded by some people of the eclipse where they found UFOs. When I presented this, very early in the morning, probably three or four o'clock in the morning, it was a revolution. Thousands of people came to the television. At five o'clock in the morning, there were more than five or 10,000 people outside the station because they wanted to get in because they were so excited with these videos. And after that show, nothing was the same for me in my life. I received many invitations from different universities in Mexico. Then I received invitations from international congresses around the world and I couldn't get away. I couldn't get away anymore. Then I started without even thinking to get so much involved because people send me videos and hundreds of videos of UFOs. And then I realized that this was very important. This was a new phenomenon, a phenomenon inside the phenomenon, where people were recording these things with cameras because everybody had a camera now or many people had a camera, VHS back in 1991. And I thought with the development of technology, more and more and more people are gonna have cameras. And then I said, well, I am very sure in the future everyone is gonna have a camera and we be able to have many more videos, many more evidences. And I started to promote people to watch the sky, when they have time to watch the sky and record whatever it was there. I never thought this was gonna be successful but then I received one video recorded by one person, and then another and another and another and then dozens and then hundreds. And then I didn't know what to do with so much evidence I had. In 1995 ended "60 Minutes" and I received more and more invitations to present conferences. And I went all around Mexico, and I mean all around Mexico, presenting all the evidences with full theaters. And I'm talking thousand people, 2,000 people everywhere. And I couldn't escape anymore. I became the center of this phenomenon in Mexico. In 1997, I started the show, "Tercer Milenio" on Televisa. That lasted until 2003. Then when out of the air. - Televisa had a huge network, the national network in Mexico, asked me to come back and present "Tercer Milenio" in 2004. We are in the midst of a reality that changes It evolves It's closer to us everyday Clear messages that appear in the farmlands of England that can't be considered the pranks of a few hoaxers Our job has been to bring this information to you to get you closer This is the age of encounter We must realize that we live in extraordinary times And I did it and I have been on the air since 2004 until now. A very successful show. Now it's running in a different network, also a national network, Azteca, and we have even grow in numbers in ratings for around 2 million people watch the show every week, which probably should be considered the most successful show on UFOs around the world. - UFOs have been the stuff of conspiracy theorist for decades often mocked for talking about it. But maybe they shouldn't be mocked. Commander David Fravor spent 18 years as a Naval aviator pilot. In 2004, he had an unforgettable encounter with an aircraft he said was defying the laws of physics. Commander Fravor joins us tonight. Thanks for coming on tonight. Tell us what you saw. - Well, we had launched on a routine training mission. When we joined up, we were told that the event was gonna be canceled and then we have real-world tasking and we were sent out to the west. Now take in mind that this has taken place about a hundred miles southwest of San Diego, between San Diego and Ensenada, Mexico on a clear perfect day, blue waters. We get out to the spot where they tell us it's at, we start looking around and both of us, both airplanes see a disturbance in the water and a white 40 foot long Tic Tac shaped object just hovering above the water going forward, back, left to right. There's no rotor wash. There's no wings, nothing. So as we drive around in a clockwise flow, we get to about the nine o'clock position, and I said I'm gonna go down and check it out and the other jet is gonna stay high. So as we go down, when we get to the 12 o'clock position, it starts to mirror us. So it's in a clockwise flow and it's on the opposite side of the circle from us. And we continue, it's in a climb or in a descent, we're getting a great look at it. This whole thing takes about probably up to five minutes from the time we show up. I get over to the eight o'clock position. It's at about the two o'clock position and I decide I'm gonna go and see what it is and it's about 2,000 feet below me. And I cut across the circle and as I get within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerates to the south in about two seconds and disappears. At one moment you were surrounded by these objects According to the information I heard from the back cabin from the chief operational coordinator there came a moment that he saw on the screens that the objects were in the back on the left side and in front of us. It was at that moment when I felt a little tension - What would you estimate the speed? - At well above supersonic. Like a bullet out of a gun, it took off. - So from what you know about aerodynamics, mechanics, physics, should this be possible, what you saw? - Not with the technology that we have today. Not at all. - Even now, even 13 years later, is there anything that you know of capable of this kind of you have behavior? - No, there is nothing I know of. When we saw the video with the IRR, it has no exhaust it, no discernible things of anything form of propulsion, and this thing came from a dead hover over the water just kind of moving around to a climb up to about 12,000 feet to rapidly accelerating away in a climb and in less than two seconds, it was gone. And you figure, you're talking 50 miles of visibility and you can easily see an object that size easily out to 10 miles and it just disappeared in seconds. But in spite of that they never could see them? We could never identify them visually with the naked eye So it was only possible to detect the presence of them through FLIR? Yes only with the infrared FLIR system, precisely That is, they were invisible to the eye? I think so because none of the crew members could see it with the naked eye From that distance, should you have been able to see them? The closest we were was two miles which a normal object or aircraft, experience tells me that we should have been able to That's the question we are left with from that operation - What would be the effects on a human pilot of the G-forces involved in that altitude change? - Well, the altitude wouldn't be bad. It would be the acceleration of the object. Well, honestly, I wanted to fly it. - Yeah, I bet. - Talking to some physicists, they don't think the human body could handle that kind of force with that acceleration. - It doesn't sound like the human body could. So bottom line, what do you think this was? - I believe, as do the other folks that were on the flight when we visually saw it, that it was something not from this world. - Presumably, you expressed that belief to your superiors. What did they say? - Actually, we caught a lot of grief getting back to the boat and it got passed off as an event that no one could explain. Now, keep in mind, they had been tracking these for two weeks prior to us seeing it. And this was the first time that manned airplanes had been airborne when the objects appeared. - This feels like a really big story to me. It's not exactly clear why Vladimir Putin's more interesting than this. I think this seems like a big deal. And Commander, I appreciate your taking the time to talk to us about it. - Back in 2004, the Secretary of Defense in Mexico called me to deliver a video to me. They recorded this video on March the fifth, 2004, close to the Campeche area but the plane was in the middle of the jungle. They were able to record these lights following the airplane. 11 lights following the airplane. The Mexican scientists went to the television to say that they were, how you say, lightning or energy in there. Bolt lighting, 11 bolt lighting following and surrounding an airplane. They went to the Secretary of Defense later and said, "Oh, we are sorry. Oh, we were wrong, sorry. But they would never say that publicly. You see? But they know they were wrong because the Secretary of Defense wouldn't deliver a video of UFOs if he knew it was something else. Then I can tell you that proves that in Mexico even the authorities are ready to accept this. The only reason we don't do it is because we don't want to confront the US. We don't want to confront the scientists from the US because they would make fun of the Mexican government and they would make jokes about that. Nobody's ready for that. More information on the target It's traveling at speed 206 and it's on a 3.01 course Here it goes, here it goes, there it goes, there it goes And why are you picking it up until now? What is it, Juarez? Juarez, what is it? It is a point A point There it is It's directly behind us Correct, now it's at 7 o'clock position with 10.5 miles It's on course 2.83 and 3.34 speed. Well, I am about to lose it on the radar and it's about to leave At 7 o'clock at the same altitude There are some clouds. It should be there What are we seeing here... There are some important apsects to comment on in addition to the audio of the 501 squad crew You can see two very large lights and below them a point that is not as bright but that is where the X is indicating maximum heat that is, the biggest energy point of those lights precisely below Let's see, what we have here? Nothing Sir Yes Commander, what is that? What was the distance more or less, Tellez? Hey, get ready... it's like... There are more. More are following behind There are 10 or 11 objects Another important aspect is that we see the objects are moving for those who suggested that these were, in fact, oil wells, the oil well burners But we can clearly see, with the clouds for reference. It remains more or less stable and the objects are moving while the clouds appear to be still. Another very important aspect. I want you to see the numbers that are on the left of your screen, there you will see a zero. Inside the zero is a small arrow. That arrow is indicating the inclination of the FLIR camera There they go, there they go Three, four, five, six... There are six of them... That is to say that it is literally at the horizon. It is not focused toward the ground, it is literally facing toward the horizon and the aircraft was flying at 3,500 meters And they're moving at speed but... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight on the screen Follow them, do not lose them Don't scare me Look out the window. We have one at approximately One O'clock and the others remain at nine They have you surrounded? Well, I don't know How far? It only tells me Today is your lucky day, young men We are not alone They are surrounding us One at 1 o'clock At one, I have it 14.8 miles with course 99 and speed of 52 He is following one and I am following the other one Okay, one is on the radar, on FLIR We are seeing it on FLIR It is a luminous object, it is in the opposite direction of us but it does not leave us, it is two miles behind us - I received a call from the secretary of the Secretary of Defense in Mexico. She asked me to come. I had an appointment, I went there, I sit down in an office, nobody was there. And when I realized I was in the drug traffic from the administration from the military, and I said, "Jesus Christ, what happened? Did somebody say that I did something? What I'm doing here? I have to go, I have to go. This is the good." And then they came and say, "Mr. Maussan, can you come with us please?" And I said, "Jesus Christ, what is gonna happen now?" And they took me to a little theater and they put the video on and they all said, "Can you explain this please?" And I saw it and I said, "Jesus, are these things following the airplane?" "Yes, and they surrounded the airplane." Yes. "Can I talk to the pilots?" "No, first tell us what you think." And I say, "Well, I think they are UFOs." The video had been recorded with a FLIR camera. This camera was, in 2004, just for the military. It was a very specialized camera that could track the infrared and could track the heat in the airspace. They were using this camera in this airplane because they were looking for narcotics from drugs from South America. And they were in the area where is the shortest in Mexico from coast to coast. And the airplanes had to go through there. And it was fairly easy to track these drug dealers. And they use this special equipment. And the military saw these lights. They couldn't see the lights with their eyes. They just saw it with the camera. But they knew, they had a screen in the airplane and they were looking at the screen even though they couldn't find it in the air, in the in the atmosphere, it was on the camera. And they got very nervous, especially when they were surrounded by these lights. The captain turned off the navigation lights because he thought he was gonna be confronted by these UFOs. Then some people came and tried to explain that video saying that they were oil rigs. Letting off fire- - Exactly and some other things, missiles and so many really crazy things. But the military were there every day for many hours in the same place and they never saw something like this. And they couldn't explain it. When I told them that these were UFOs, they said, "Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Maussan." And I left. They didn't tell me anything else. I receive a call again a couple of days later and they say, "The Secretary of Defense want to see you personally in his office." I went there and then he asked me, "What do you think they are?" And I said, "UFOs, can I talk to the crew?" "You will, you will. You are gonna be the only one who's gonna do that. I'm going to give you the tape. You can do whatever you want. Just remember that you have the honor and the pride of the Armed Forces of Mexico in your hearts. Be very careful." When we made a turn to go towards Campeche the FLIR camera operator detected a white a target without form. It was shining. It was detected by the infrared camera... and it was being observed at all times with that camera Later we saw that we... We saw other targets on the left side of the aircraft, Apparently, there were eleven targets In this case, we can assume that these eleven points that produced heat and that are seen through the FLIR video were they there even though they were not visible? They were there, and we referenced that by their positions They were always to the left of us, flying at the same height, and at approximately the same speed. Well, we tried to find an image and the points remained hot at all times, completely hot Very hot? Very hot. They did have an irregular shape They were always circles Is this irregular with respect to aircraft? That you have previously detected? Yes, it is irregular because they did not have a shape they did not have a shape of any object I have seen before In other words, you have never seem or experienced this before? It had never happened to me, it is something that I don't know what to say, I can't tell you what it was I couldn't relate this experience to something I saw before - "If somebody asks you who gave you this video?" I thought, "Oh, he's gonna to say, 'You don't know who gave you this.'" "You are gonna say that the Secretary of Defense gave you these video." And I say, "Jesus Christ." My pants almost fell down. I had this evidence, they have given me this evidence and the Secretary of Defense of Mexico was supporting me whatever I did with this. I felt a big responsibility. I investigated everything I could with this tape. I had a chance to interview all the crew, the captain, and the cameraman, and everyone that was inside the plane and all of them told me, "This is real, we've never seen anything like this." And then I presented this video in a national television program in Mexico, in the newscast, in the most important newscast on may, the ninth, 2004. Next day, I gave a press conference and all the international media came to the press conference. I gave them this video and next night or that night it was everywhere around the world in every single newscast. I don't think there is a sighting of UFOs that has been presented everywhere like this happened in 2004. And then I thought that I had done my job the best I could. I never expected that the explanations that were gonna be given to this incredible video were gonna be so stupid as they were. Simultaneously recording video in the normal visual spectrum and infrared spectrum. This is the official name of the system developed by Pedro Avila, a Mexican that watches sky He's the creator of the technique that some say is a tool to study the UFO phenomenon worldwide Well, first of all, it makes me very proud to know that what I'm presenting here is something real. It's something genuine Pedro Avila, national director of the sky watchers who from this window recorded the most amazing unidentified flying objects is the creator of the technique which the official name of this system is Simultaneous video-recording technique in the normal and infrared spectrum - After I learned that there were UFOs that were invisible to the eye, I proposed that idea on television. And Pedro Avila, a UFO hunter who cannot walk, he's in a chair, he's looking through his window all day long, built a device to put two cameras, one infrared and one normal spectrum, and he was able, it's the only time that this has ever been done everywhere, where you have a camera recording in the normal spectrum and the other camera in the infrared. And you can see this object in the infrared and you cannot clearly see anything in the normal spectrum proving that there are UFOs that are not visible to the eyes, to the sight. And I think that was very important. From then on, more and more people and with the development of technology, even the FLIR technology now available to many people, to almost anyone who wants to have a FLIR camera now, you can have it, and now many people are recording these invisible UFOs everywhere and it is just amazing. And we are proving now that what was said 15 years ago with the military in Mexico, it's happening in many, many places right now. You've got it from a few different locations where they filmed this, is that right, Darcy, that's in the documentary itself? Yeah, actually the two videos that were used in the documentary that were pretty popular on TV network circulation back in the '90s when this first happened were from the vantage point of Puebla, which is just north of Mexico City, it's another little city, and Mexico City. So another famous UFO sighting was the Jerusalem Temple Rock, a UFO that kind of hovered around the dome there. And that was recorded by, I think, five different individuals walking around the city. Are there specific hotspots where these craft are being seen continually? It comes from time to time. Right now, for example, from the last few years, couple three or four years, we've been receiving many videos from the northwest of Mexico around Rosarito, Tijuana, San Diego in California, even around Los Angeles. Around five, 10 years ago, there were hundreds of videos that were coming from Russia. Probably Russia is because of the development of new nuclear weapons because they happen mostly around St. Petersburg in the Crimean Peninsula. They all just are mostly in places where they have some interest. Now you said that there's another really massive siting something- - Oh yeah, yeah, let me tell you about it. The people might not be aware of. - The second interview and I'm waiting to do that third interview. On the morning, four o'clock in the morning of December 19th, there was a huge, and I mean a huge UFO pyramid above the Pentagon? Some people say, "Oh, it's animation." No. I was able to find, I think I am the only one who has investigated this case, the pyramids was just 300 feet from the ground and in the middle of the Pentagon, above the Pentagon. The images are incredible. Three different people, one of them that was walking with his dog. Another two people who were in a taxi, in a cab. And the third one was taking photographs inside the cemetery in Arlington. The three of them with cameras in their hands, because they couldn't do it with a cell phone, were able to get incredible images of these pyramid moving and rotating above the Pentagon. What is amazing is that normally in the US, not a single media, not The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBS, NBC, et cetera, et cetera. What's that? This is aliens, I tell you. Yes, yes, I'm really sorry but I was talking. Oh man, what is this? This is a fucking alien invasion. Do you see it? Where is it? Give me the camera. What is this? I mean, what the fuck is that? Turn left, left! Have we lost it? Look back, look back! I got you, baby. I see it. Turn right, turn right, turn right! Do you see it? Can it be like a ancient God? You're stupid. Slow down, man, slow down. What? It's gone. I don't, I don't see it. Man, do you see it? I've heard something on the news. Something about Russian military. No, it's not Russia. It's Pentagon. I seen it already, man. It's a bomber, it was announced the news. You know. No, man. Turn on the radio, it should tell us something. Turn on the radio. Has done anything around this incredible case. We found something very similar that happened on December the ninth, 2010 above the Kremlin. In the Red Square in Moscow, exactly the same object. This was recorded and presented by RT. - The Kremlin has been circled by a UFO. Well, that's if you believe a video which has soared to the top of YouTube's Russian website. The pictures apparently shot from a passing car have become an online sensation. Another YouTube clip filmed during daylight shows a fuzzy gray object on the skyline near Red Square. Skeptics, however, say that if the images were real the public would have reported sightings to police who are currently making no comment. And in different media newscasts in Russia, it was never presented in the US. And it's exactly the same thing. And I believe that sighting has a lot of meaning. I now know why it was there that day. That day Donald Trump signed the memorandum creating the space combat command, the US Space Combat Command that very same day. Amicizia - friendship was an experiment carried out by beings from another world to try to establish communication with humans to help our development This is very difficult to understand this. - Not really so. I believe it is in the moment you accept the idea that the people for other stars may live here. Then all comes immediately, it's quite easy to accept it. According to Stefano Breccia Not only was a group established on Earth a group that they called w56 but there were others who were given the name of opposites or the CTR who had other interests and values this situation generated a conflict between both groups that even caused the death of some involved they explained to Bruno Samacicia and Giancarlo De Carlo that this group of aliens are on our planet because they are very concerned about the destructive attitude that man on Earth has toward nature These beings explain that they are very concerned about the atomic bomb that a nuclear weapon, in the event of a war could destroy all of humanity in a few minutes Then they explained that they are here to take care of our planet and possibly humanity According to the witnesses and the account of Stefano Breccia in his book mass contact, all those beings who participated in amicicia were moved by the deep morality and sincere humanism of these beings unable to imagin even doing harm to any person or animal however they liked to eat well, drink and even smoke sometimes They liked to play tennis and play musical instruments such as the violin it was their decision to keep this story a secret even though on some occasions news about their activity came out the news was vague and uncertain According to Stefano Breccia there were many who suspected that something was happening but no one outside the group could imagine how great and deep the contact with extraterrestrial beings was One of the participants who prefers to remain anonymous confessed to the researcher Nicola Duper that in 2008 there were 200 beings from the group that was called w56 The w because it meant life and the 56 for the year in which the contact was made a disk is not generally used for travel but as a mobile laboratory it is also important to know that a ship is built and disassembled at the end of the task which it was made for a ship is not a single block but rather more parts held together by a force that can be defined as gravitational for the humans sometimes it is not easy to define the type of technology used by these beings The technology and every part of it is so advanced this it is not conceivable for the poor Earthlings who struggle to understand the simplest of things without complete success in most cases, another but very important curiosity, is that a spacecraft of this type But also all the others, even large ones, are built with iron what we ofter call synthesized in fact, a small ship like the one in the photo above weighs around 15 to 20 tons of iron The iron that w56 uses is no different from what we use except in a quality inaccessible to us for now This iron is of the polarized type, therefore it is capable of of offering qualities that no amorphous iron can possess amorphous, is an electric abnormality on the atomic level the amorphous solid, is a solid that has no form of its own and lacks crystaline lattice structure with a long-range order of positioned atoms solids in which there is a long-range atomic order called crystalline solids crystalline material metals are difficult to prepare in an amorphous condition the solidification process generally has to be done very quickly unless the material has a high melting temperature like ceramic or a low level of crystallization what usually happens with polymers, in the iron from w56 it has crystaline lattice structure this type of iron is not a thermal conductor, nor an electric conductor it is non-magnetic and radiation resistant But it can be made transparent by applying an electromagnetic field at a certain power level this peculiarity in fact explains why flying saucers are sometimes invisible during sightings There is more, the transparent surface can be unilateral that is only from the inside out or bilateral that is from the outside in and vice versa and in that case you can see a disk like this Regarding the bases of these beings, according to Stefano Breccia it was widely said that the aliens of w56 had built a huge, very deep and practical underground base located at the bottom of the continental mass and many more typically small ones at shallow depths the large base was a point of reference for all their European activities and normally it was housing machinery the smaller bases were used as places for living they said that they had other bases withing our solar system but they were not stable structures Actually generating or destroying a base was a very simple process for them let's think of two linear magnets initially parallel to eachother rotating one of them around its center of gravity the lines of force will become more and more intertwined as the angle between the magnets increases after a critical attraction the lines of force of the magnetic field will change abruptly, arranging themselves in a new arrangement that prevents them from twisting too much Our friends, on the other hand, were able to generate what they called a magnetic rope that is, a structure where the lines of force were stricly twisted around each other Such effect had the ability of opening the matter, compressing it sideways, crushing it on itself translucent walls were almost crystalline with an astronomical density an equally high modulus of longitudinal elasticity and an incredible force were thus able to open the cavities that would become their bases obviously without damaging in any way the tectonic structures that surrounded it, on the contrary probably by strengthening them, said structure remained stable as long as the fields that generated it were active it was enough to turn off these fields with click of a button to immediately return the matter back to it's original form similarly they were opening passages to access their bases when they needed them closing them immediately when they were no longer in use, rarely with very small bases Just below the ground stable corridors were used in the large bases where also large ships generally in orbit around our sun aligned with respect to the ecliptic at first it seems that there were three different races the redheads, the copper-haired people, the black-haired people more similar to our indians today, the third race had greenish-white hair by the way their skin was colored similar to their hair these three races have evolved together with the passage of time they began to reproduce between eachother so that a new race was born before dying Bruno Sammaciccia told us some of the most important messages he had received from the beings called w56 the first words they said were "this land was made for good but the men who inhabit it" "are transforming everything into evil" "we are not here to conquer, we have nothing to overcome" "our interests arise from the fact that" "your land is within our stars" Gaspare De Lama participated in the amicizia project between 1960 and 1965, I kept secret some of the evidence that proves that the case really happened as the witnesses have assured Gaspare, because of his closeness to Bruno Samaciccia, the leader of the group of humans in Italy, received photographs and made some of the films that still exist Here I am as a young man, 41 years of age, here is Bruno Sammaciccia? Sammaciccia in the little green garden of the village Montesilvano he always told me, "Don't betray your memories" It is written in the photo Gaspare agreed to show some of the 8mm photographs and films that he still has in his possession do you see this black part here? we called this "Penachito" this is a small model of about 4 meters this is model it was remotely controlled it does not require a crew member It had a small detector that we called "the little mouse" in additon to the video, we also took pictures of this craft, it was a kind of... now I speak in an incorrect non-scientific way, it was a kind of energy that condenses I saw that it was on the surface, I don't know what kind of energy it was It is in an irregular way, here you see it and here it does not come off in these photos the energy appears and dissappears, in the same disk this disk followed us until we got close to Milan in these photos we are taking this photo from an open field we had an appointment with this disk by the w56 to record it with photos and film This disk here, it was a gift from them to me, they said "you will see the technology we have" They lived most of their time in their huge underground bases but some of them lived among us within our society playing all kinds of roles in the world One was a university researcher, another the managing director of a fairly important textile company in the center of Italy a third was a senior manager at one of the largest German telecommunications companies names T.L.C But the most important difference between all the contact stories that can be read is the role that we Earthlings play in the eyes of our counterparts from off world this was expressed many times that we inhabitants of this distressed planet enjoy unique psychic abilities while we are unaware of it the w56 said this ability was one of the main reasons they came here "often it was even fun for us to watch these people with such" "fantastic technology by their side" "begging our help in particular operations against their enemies" and when the story came to an abrupt end it was because of a failure on our part when most of the earthlings got scared or simply fooled by the enemy then we stopped supporting the w56 friends, this development was enough to endanger them by reducing their superiority against their enemies they had to stop their operations here and retreat to their origins however they promised to return in the future in a surprising way, Emelio appeared at an event where Piere Giorgio Caria and Jaime Maussan would present evidence of their research and agreed after having repeatedly refused to discuss the amicizia case The amicizia case is true, there are people who have traveled from another world it is not true that they left in 1978 because a small group is still here the basis of this story is true but not very pleasant things have happened in the sense of human relationships humans know themselves, it is not defined by materialism and spirituality Gaspare was the only one left in the group I decided to stay, because I felt this way the amicizia case, it is truely extraordinary things have happened and they are true. Have you learned the way of my friend's teachings? There are three types of writings, one of the blue people another of the giants and another of the dwarfs it is something similar to an alphabet which I have been able to learn because I have an unusual sensitivity this is how I was able to read their writings do you understand them completely or is this how you interpret them? That's right, Bruno replied to me a lot because he has seen me speak to them in their own language they haven't spoken to many others Bruno told me one thing within the framework of laws of his federation, what we could call cosmic laws, something that they lived by otherwise we would be worse off, but we agreed that they would not intervene with our history There are laws where if you want something sooner or later, this is achieved without intervention but I think, and I feel that they can intervene, I don't know in what way though very light intervention and within the limits in which they can be accepted they need the presence of a significant number of the population like when a teacher arrives who was summoned and a god or supreme being gives the people what they need I think a significant mass is required they will then act at the limit of their intervention without intervening with our freedom as when you are a child and they tell you that you should not touch that electrical outlet but the second time, the child know that he should not touch it for his own good I remember that on the day that I was with Jaime Maussan and Joseph Garofalo, they were very important collaborators of mine Garofalo was a very capable computer analyst with which we analyzed the photographs and videos of amicizia and we were going with Jaime and Garofalo to the city where the house of the Virgin Mary is located the city of Loretto that was transpired there tells the story by the angels and while we were on the road on the highway Garofalo watched he saw that we were followed by a saucer and unfortunately he was able to record video at the moment when the saucer was already very far away, but by analyzing this video the object is very similar to the amicizia objects greet us? we do not know but it is another interesting fact that we can add to this incredible story, maybe another will come out but not until today at least as I already said about another protagonist who is Emilio, he did not accept to go out to the public and gave us an interview, he is also very old but perhaps in the future other material will come out - They know, the security agencies know that sooner or later one of these cases is gonna go out. It's gonna be on YouTube and it's gonna be recorded by different people at the same time. Just consider for one second. If the Zimbabwe incident in September, 1994 if this happens now with all the kids with a cell phone, with a camera. Can you imagine five, 10 kids recording the same extraterrestrials presenting them the same day in the afternoon on YouTube all around the world? How could you describe this? The agencies are ready to give up. You have to remember John Podesta talking where he said he wrote in a tweet, the only thing that I regret working for Obama is that I could not open the ET phenomenon. And he became the manager, the chief of the campaign of Hillary Clinton. And she said, "I'm going to open this." And I was rooting for her because I knew she was gonna do it. I know the Pentagon, I know the military were ready because they cannot keep these secrets so much longer. One of these days it's gonna come up, it's gonna blow. The Chinese now have an incredible radio telescope for one kilometer in diameter, something like that. And they are looking for signals and they are looking and everyone, everyone is looking for life there. Europeans, the Indians, everyone. This is changing so fast. You are gonna have the big telescopes like ALMA in Chile or other telescopes are gonna look to the infrastructure of different planets. They're gonna look for cities. They're gonna look for satellites around the planets. The James Webb telescope that is gonna be on orbit on 2020 or '21 is gonna look for infrastructure. There is not much time for the agencies. They have to open. The first try was on December 16th, 2017 when The New York Times presented this information and Luis Elizondo from the Pentagon came up and said, "I'm resigning there because I want this to be open" and they presented three incredible videos. And nobody has been able to discredit that. Nobody. Then what happens? We have the evidence right there. It's the first time they tried something. And we know there are people investigating materials. And I think very soon we will have a big surprise coming from the agencies. They better do because one of these days there is gonna be a case that they won't be able to control as they did in the past. Other material, other people, I know they exist, that some of them are alive but it is a hope more than a certainty
