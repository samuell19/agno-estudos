Dear viewers, Changing Your Fate is here again. Tonight, the topic I'm going to discuss with you is... Stray Ghosts. My godmother says this guy is very powerful. —In what way? —You're so naughty. I mean he has supernatural power. My godfather used to look for him when he wanted advice on feng shui. How is your godfather now? He's dead. It's controversial tonight. You people slacking in here? Why are you all sitting here? It's pouring outside, nobody will come. That's why the roads will become slippery... and many accidents will take place. Please. Come on. Hey, why don't you move? I'm off duty. Come on. Ghosts are of Yin energy, and Yin is composed of coldness and wetness. Take tonight's weather for example. Stray ghosts love to come out in such weather. So don't leave home if it's not necessary. Otherwise you'll run into ghosts easily. It's best to watch Changing Your Fate at home with host Master Lui Kong. If you feel uneasy, don't worry. Say this prayer with me, "Om ma la pad mei hung..." Remember to make this sign, "Om ma la pad mei hung." Are you feeling better? "Om ma la pad mei hung." "Om ma la pad mei hung..." Louder. "Om ma la pad mei hung..." Have confidence! Be careful, granny. Nurse, my granny keeps vomiting and is having diarrhoea. ID card. —How are you feeling? —I want the patient's ID card. You should be polite to the patient. Granny, what's wrong with you? I keep vomiting and having diarrhoea. I have no more strength. Don't panic, let me do a check-up for you. It's inside this pocket. If you meet a ghost, it's because you committed sins in your past life. If you feel uneasy, I advise you to mail order a set of... "Merciful Protective Mirrors" specially designed by me. Look, how nice it is! On it is the prayer written with blood from my finger. Not only can it cast away ghosts, but your rivals too. It's also useful for those who are afraid of being bullied. For female viewers, there's a special one for you too. Look, it can prevent molesters too, isn't it practical? Believe me, with Lui Kong, you needn't fear at night. Come in. I think it's nothing serious. You might have eaten something dirty. I'm now prescribing some medicine. Go home and drink more water. You will be fine after resting. Doctor, there are few doctors as kind as you in the Emergency Room. Every doctor in this hospital is kind. Faith, remember to ask for this doctor when you bring me here again. —Doctor, what's your... —My name is Kwan. —Kwan... —Okay, granny. What's wrong with you? —Don't catch a cold. —Thanks. —This is... —She's my granddaughter. My name is Faith Ching. Just call me Faith. My name is Care Kwan. No wonder you're so caring to my granny. Wait outside for your name to be called. You can leave after collecting medicine. Hello, this is Changing Your Fate. —Master Lui. —Speaking. Others say I have Yin Yang eyes, that I always see dirty things... but I can't distinguish, what are their characteristics? Good question! Generally speaking, they're always dressed in white. If they're the fierce ones that are full of resentment or sins... then they are dressed in red. They have long hair. Only their toes touch the ground. They have dark red eyes. Black nails. And they appear in front of you suddenly. Om ma la pad mei hung... —What is it? —He scared me, scold him for me! Why are you dressed like a ghost at midnight? You'll scare everyone here. —I'm sorry. —Don't be afraid. —Sorry. —It's all right. Let's go get the prescription. Why did you apologize to her? You scared the granny. That old bag should just die soon. She's just wasting our resources. May-may, you mustn't say that. Hey, why didn't you call me tonight? Your girlfriend has come again? Can't I come here? Sure, you may even sleep here. Shall I make up the bed for you? Leslie. The wind keeps blowing, I don't want to leave you. Hey, you haven't answered me yet. I've been busy. You don't need to call me if you're busy? Don't you need me every minute? Yes, I do... Look at yourself. I'm virtuous, intelligent... gorgeous, husband and children will prosper because of me. You should consider yourself lucky that I'm your girlfriend. You should cherish me. I will. Right, it's my mom's birthday tomorrow. Come and play mahjong with her. I really know nothing about mahjong. Then you can lose some money to that old bag. That old bag saves up the money she wins, it'll become mine later on. I thought you wanted to fulfil your filial piety. The government gives them so much benefits, I don't need to. When she runs out of money, she can live on welfare. Good idea. Doctor Kwan, please come here, we have something to talk to you about. I haven't finished yet. Doctor Kwan... Do you dare go? Maybe they need me for an urgent matter. Just try and go! Are you a man, Doctor Kwan? We asked you to come because we want to rescue you... so she won't be in your hair. Did you hear that? He's insulting your girlfriend. Go and beat him up if you're a man. Will you stop being so unreasonable? I'm unreasonable? How dare you! May-may! Don't get in my way! What's wrong with you? I stopped this taxi before you! Kwan, why bother to chase her? Just let her go. I only want to stop her and teach her a lesson. —You dare to reprimand her? —Why not? I can even slap her face. If you're a man, don't go to her mother's birthday party tomorrow. Your turn. Miss, your wine. What the heck. It's my birthday and I can't even win. Did you hear that? Throw a tile for mother now. Of all things, you have to keep the same type of tiles. Pong! Kwan, didn't I say you're a poor player? Pure. I agree. All pongs, all terminals. That's ten fans. Do you know how to play mahjong? Are you two conspiring in this game? Old bag, don't be a sore loser. Why is your birthday such a big deal? Pay up. Hurry up. You really get on my nerves. I don't want to play with you! Grill me a sausage. Leslie, you play. —Me? —Good. Keep the money if you win. I'll pay if you lose. Leslie, let me introduce you. This is my cousin Irene. —How do you do? —How do you do? Many guys are wooing Irene. I can tell. Ask Irene out if you have time. Sure, when I have time. Why don't you make it today? Let's not play mahjong. Why don't you take a walk with Irene in the garden? Aunt, I am not a casual guy. I can tell. Since you two can get along so well, you might as well chat here. Mom, we'll go and eat something. —Sure. —Play some games first. —Aunt! May-may! —Come on. Leslie. Miss, what can I do for you? Have you seen the movie "Titanic?" It's about a wreckage of a steamer. Promise me... What, Jack? Listen, I love you! I love you, Jack! No matter what happens, never die... Yes, Jack, never die. I'll never die, you die. Stupid! Your smile is lovely. Fatty, what are you doing? Where's your mother? Why did you shout at that child? Aren't you playing mahjong? Didn't you say you've bought a present for mother? Aunt, just a little token to show my respect to you. What a big peach! I must hold it tight. Otherwise, it'll be blown away. Why did you buy such a small one? I paid $10,000 for it. You're getting stingier. What's wrong with you, Fatty? Where's your mother? I've told you not to scold children. Sorry. Give in to mom. She won't have many birthdays. Whatever you give her will become mine in the future. You have a point there. Right, mom and I went house hunting yesterday. Let's buy one for our wedding as the prices are coming down. Let's discuss that in the future. But I am paying the deposit tomorrow. Write me a cheque of $2 million now. I don't have $2 million! What? You want to marry my daughter but you don't have $2 million? Wishful thinking! Frankly speaking, I don't want to. —What? —What? Let me tell you frankly. I've been like a servant all night. And that Fatty bullies me. I discarded a self-drawn winning tile for you to win and yet you scolded me. I must change my thinking. May-may, I've decided to reconsider our relationship. Good! Kwan. I've never seen you so gutsy before. Care Kwan, be smart and apologize at once. If not, forget about seeing me anymore. Kwan, don't give in. If you do, you'll die horribly. Let's go. Will you apologize? Let's go! Go if you dare. Don't come back if you walk out of here! Aunt, since you said the peach is small... give it back to me! Care Kwan, how dare you! Cheers to regaining your freedom. I really shouldn't. Come on, you regret it now? I mean I shouldn't have waited until now. I've wasted my youth. That's more like it! Let me take you to Lan Kwai Fong tomorrow. Have you forgotten that I'm going to Mainland tomorrow? Right, your grandmother passed away. It'll take me around a month. I have to see to the funeral and take her ashes back. My grandmother is the only relative I have. So now, I am an orphan. Don't be so down. I tell you what. I'll let you have Sexy. No, thanks, I'm not interested. You've got to be kidding me. Pulse and respiration are weak. Don't touch her. Call the ambulance. It'll be too late, there's nothing we can stop her bleeding with. The hospital is nearby, let's take a chance. Drive the car here. Doctor Kwan... Miss Ching, don't worry. There are two doctors in this car, we'll drive you to the hospital. You know her? Her granny was my patient. She has no pulse! Hurry up! Ask the Emergency Room to get ready. Kwan, our hospital doesn't have her blood type. —What type? —O negative. —What a coincidence. —You're that type too? I know my blood type is rare. So I keep a packet for myself just in case. Call up Red Cross now. I fear we don't have time. I'll transfer blood to her immediately. —Who will do the operation? —Doctor Ma. Three times at 200 volt. 1001! 1002! 1003! Doctor Ma, I think we have to increase by fifty. She is showing response. Doctor Kwan, how is that girl? Leslie and Doctor Ma are performing the operation on her. Her pelvis is smashed and there is internal bleeding. You'd better take a rest now. I've to catch an early flight tomorrow. I am leaving now. —Take good care of her. —Sure. —Bye. —See you, bye. Granny, I'm back. Come back. Take it all. It's late, go home now. I asked you to feed the fish, but you're wooing girls? No, sorry. It's my fault. Spare me... Look, your grandmother's ashes, look... Ashes. Oh no! Grandma, don't blame Leslie. He didn't mean to. Kwan, I guarantee I won't fool around in your place next time. Don't you have a home? Why must you fool around in my home? Sexy said she liked excitement in a new place. Nonsense! After watching that VCD... you said it's more exciting to make love in someone else's place. How dare you blame me? Go home and do whatever you like. Give me a chance to redeem myself. One. No, I really regret it very much. Two. Okay! Let's go. Goodbye. I left something behind. Bye... Now what? Doctor Kwan, sorry to bother you. You are... I'm Faith Ching, the girl you rescued that night. I remember you. You've recovered so soon? —Come in, please. —Is it convenient? Sure... Please take a seat. Please sit down. —Want some tea? —No, thanks. —Just a moment. —Thanks. How do you know I live here? There's a notebook in the jacket you put on me that night. It has your phone number and address. I've had your jacket dry-cleaned. —Thanks. —Here is your notebook. I'm glad to see that you have recovered. —You're very nice. —Yeah... Have some tea. Sorry, I don't drink weight-reducing tea. It's for myself, there's a little side effect. Isn't it better to do exercise? I look stupid when I do exercise. Whenever I jog, my feet split apart. My friends say whenever I jog... my buttocks would shake. Try taking a stroll next time. Where should I stroll by myself? What if I take a stroll with you? Good idea. I'm really happy that you've recovered so soon. I must thank you again. You should thank the doctor and nurses who operated on you that night. Now your blood is flowing inside my body. You bled so much on me last time. I only gave you back a little. I'll pay you interest later on. Don't talk nonsense. There's something I wonder if I should ask you. Go ahead. Why were you so upset that night? You thought I tried to commit suicide? Did I say something wrong? I went to fix the antenna, but I fell down carelessly. I'm relieved then. When I was small, I loved walking a tightrope. I've always loved... climbing up the railings. —Be careful. —I don't fear heights, I'm good at this. When I do this, I feel very free. Miss, I don't have much blood left. Stop it and come down. —What are you staring at? —My boss's car. Your boss? Come down first. —Who is your boss? —Tinson Kei. That nouveau riche? It's said that he's doing a lot of illegal businesses. I guess so. Excuse us. Could you take a picture of us, please? Ready. One more. Smile. —Thank you. —Okay. We would like to take you and your girlfriend a picture. —Yeah! —Great! One more. Okay. Sir, can I have your address that I can send you a copy? This is my name card. —Oh, you are a doctor. —Yeah. —Thank you. Bye. —Thanks. Bye. Foreigners are so passionate. Doctor Kwan. Call me Care. Care Kwan, means caring for others. Care Kwan, I want to treat you to dinner, just to thank you. Treat me to dinner? Sure. So he really has another girl. —Aunt. —Doctor Kwan. You've come to see Faith? Yes, you can call me Care. Care? Care means caring for others. I think I'd better call you Doctor Kwan. Come in please. Hi! Why are you so impolite? Doctor Kwan saved me and Faith. Have a chat with him. Have a seat. You're watching TV? She asked me to chat with you. What good movies have you watched recently? I don't watch movies. Have you made profit in the stock market? I don't invest. Have you tried losing weight? I don't lose weight. I have nothing to say then. It's meaningless to chat with you. Kwan? Sorry, I didn't buy any presents for you. Come on, no one buys a present to visit others nowadays. Doctor Kwan, we can eat now. Aunt, you cook really fast. Just common dishes, sit down —Come on, sit down. —Thanks. Let me introduce you. This is my elder brother. —We've already met. —This is my younger brother. Brother. Hi, brother. Make yourself at home, eat now. Let's eat... —Aunt, let's eat. —Let's eat. How can Kwan hide a vamp in here? That woman is so cheap. Care Kwan, I'm afraid. Where are you? What is it? I seem to hear someone calling me. Our neighbours usually have their TV on loud. Doctor Kwan, come more often if you have time. Don't worry, I will. Care Kwan... Care Kwan! It's me, what are you doing here? —Strange. —What is it? I seem to hear my friend calling me. Your friend? My ex-girlfriend. But we're ordinary friends now. Hey! Let's sit at the balcony, it's cooler. Sure. Don't go away... It's all right... Driver, get going, hurry up! There are ghosts! Do they look like me? Don't worry. Right, breathe. Ghost...! —What is it? —Ghost... Why did you let her in? She seems mad, I can't stop her. Okay. What is it? Ghost! Care Kwan is enchanted. May-may, just admit you've broken up. It's no big deal. Even if you stir up trouble here, Kwan won't come back to you. It's so scary, he couldn't hear me. He was talking to the air and eating air too. Okay... Come on, take it easy. Let me call Kwan for you, okay? Okay? I'll give you an injection then, you'll feel comfortable. You'll feel comfortable. Okay? Double the anaesthetic. Stop her from screaming. Good girl. Relax. Ghost...! Relax. Don't be afraid. —Don't panic, calm down. —Ghost! —Sit down... —How are you? —Are you all right? —Don't be afraid. What do you think? —Ghost. —Yes, ghost. How is she now? She has calmed down. Shall we inform Doctor Kwan? No, just let her sleep for a while. She is being possessed, she won't come round so soon. No, she's foaming at the mouth. No, she's only playing with her saliva. Is a ghost really sitting on her? Keep an eye on her. Still playing with her saliva. That's me when I was small. I had long hair at fifteen years old. I remember an old woman was behind me when I took a lift. She kept staring at me in the lift. She kept trembling. So I asked her, "Granny, what's wrong with you?" Upon hearing me, that old woman squatted and gave me her wallet. I don't believe that. You're lying. It's true. I was worried that she thought I wanted to molest her. Then did you take her wallet? No, I only molested her. Nonsense. I'm the killer-with-cutter. I invited you here just to molest you. I know you won't. In fact, I am... I am the Killer Doctor's brother. I invited you here just to molest you. Don't say anymore, I'm scared. Not only you, I am scared too. Don't be afraid. Welcome to my programme, Changing Your Fate. Dear viewers, whether you believe it or not... there are really ghosts in this world. —Today, I want to discuss with you... —Do you believe? —the relation of religion and ghosts. —Yes. In ghost movies, they use amulets to scare ghosts away. In fact, this is totally wrong. Whether an amulet is effective or not... depends mainly on the ghosts' belief, Buddhism or Taoism. If the ghosts believe in Catholicism... they will definitely not fear this amulet. —Right. —And in vampire movies... the ghost fears anyone who holds a cross. This is again wrong! The one holding a cross must have confidence in it... —to make it effective. —Right. You seem to be very interested in this kind of thing. —What kind of thing? —Gods and ghosts. I'm just a beginner. That is the evil power. Some evil powers are really strong. I saw an evil statue called Tajba in Thailand. The owner of it is a woman. Everyone calls her Thai-Woman. She told me that the statue has very strong controlling power... against all ghosts. Because he eats ghosts! He will eat you no matter which religion you believe in. Don't blink, I have a photo of Tajba. Nonsense. —Lui Kong will tell you more later. —Faith. Stay tuned to Changing Your Fate. Faith. Faith, what's wrong? I feel cold. Hold me tight. Don't panic, let me get you some hot tea. No, just hold me. My will is not that strong. I'm afraid I might do something wrong. You must have seen movies about a human loving a ghost. In the movies, they say humans are Yang while ghosts are Yin. When a man loves a ghost, he will die of energy exhaustion. This is totally wrong as well. In fact, love between a human and a ghost doesn't involve physical contact. Making love with a ghost is like making love with the air. It's just an illusion in the mind. There won't be any problem. So love between a human and a ghost is like masturbation. It's all right to do it from time to time. But it's bad to do it a few times every day. We won't get venereal disease, or need to use a condom. One needn't pay money to the partner too. It's a good way for lonely men to pass the time. Has she gone to buy breakfast? Good morning! What are you doing here so early? I've something amusing to tell you, so I rushed here after work. What's so amusing? —Your ex-girlfriend met ghosts. —May-may? Yes, she came to look for me at the Emergency Room last night. She said, "Care Kwan is enchanted by ghosts, please help him." Then she kept running and screaming. I didn't really care, I gave her an injection to calm her down. She's been sleeping till now, her mother has just taken her away. Have you finished? I'll sleep then. Come on, chat with me. A girl spent the night here last night? —No... —Yes... I have three reasons, listen carefully. Firstly, why did you have last night off? Secondly, you normally don't clean your place. Look! It's so neat now. Thirdly, why are you pointing it at me? If you have a new girlfriend, tell me about her. So I won't woo her accidentally. Hello? Is it Aunt? No, Leslie speaking. —What is it? —It's May-may's mother. She said May-may is being possessed. Look at her, she's starving. She has eaten everything at home. May-may... This woman is nosy, so I must punish her. Are you mad? She really seems to be possessed. Hey, who are you? Who exactly are you? —Tell me! —You do know me. Give me your arm to bite! Stop it! You're biting off my flesh! What do you want? We'll do as you wish. What must we do? Kwan, we mustn't let this go on. Let's ask for advice from Master Lui Kong. Dear viewers, it's me again. Happy to meet you again in Changing Your Fate. Master Lui... Sorry, I have something to discuss with you. No problem. Here's what happened. I've received many complaints recently. They complained that you're advertising for yourself. And the ratings are getting lower. The higher-ups said you can stop after these two episodes. You mean they're firing me? I can't help you. Take care. Sorry. Chuen, how about the feng shui thing? I can even invite a deity to possess me. Master Lui! —Master Lui! —What is it? My photos are only available in Sino Centre and Shin Tat Centre. We come all the way for you. How can I help? We'd like to ask for your opinion about something unbelievable. Well, I can teach you about believable things. But I have to charge you for unbelievable things. No problem, but this incident is really evil. No problem. The more evil is it, the more I'll charge you. You'd better be good. I'm professional, I deserve the charge. The market rate is $50,000. $10,000 for every ghost captured. Do you agree? I'm unemployed now, I must get some money from them. 1:00 am is the most active time of the spirit world. May-may, no. Lui Kong! They are my fans. You told them I'm coming tonight? —No. I didn't. —How do they know then? Why is my head feeling cold? It's sinful... it's full of Yin energy here, maybe I'll come another night. Are you backing out or are you scared? Scared? I just fear you don't have money. Is it enough? Lui Kong, come up here! I don't know why, but I suddenly feel unwell. Maybe I'll refund $1,000 to you. Can you manage? Okay. Let's go. May-may... I'm scared. She got her voice back. Have the three ghosts gone away? Do you know where they have gone to? Here! Who are you? Why are you messing around here? You lousy swindler. You're the one who is messing around. One, two, where's the third one? Here. —Kwan, you must hang in there... —Don't come near. Get lost! Let me give this woman a slap! Although she's nosy... but she's kind-hearted. Please spare her, okay? —What happened, Master? —How would I know? You were possessed. Possessed? Master, where are the ghosts? She's so bad, why must you help her? Although she treated me badly, I won't let you harm her. I know, but I don't know her. It's none of my business. Why did she stab my buttocks? Let's see how you're going to help her. —Brother, chop me now. —Get the chopper. Why are you holding me? The ghost has left you. Where is it now? Here. Don't leave me behind. No... —Don't go. —Don't stop me. What should they do if you go away? If I don't go, I'll be possessed. What can we do to chase the ghosts away? Are you human or ghost? Take it away, I am human. Where are Leslie and May-may? They're inside. Hello. Long time no see, do you miss me? The patient is here! I'll kill you all! Give me back my properties! Leave me alone... Aunt, go out and see if there's an old woman outside. —Me? —Yes, quick! That's enough for tonight. Forget it, for the sake of Kwan. What happened? Am I fine? Am I okay? Okay... May-may, what happened? That night, I followed you to that house. I saw you talking to the air. You even ate the air. Then that fatty asked me not to be nosy. I didn't know what I was doing after that. Care Kwan, you got enchanted by ghosts. It's useless, I won't go back to you again. Don't tell lies. She might be lying, but I won't lie, right? I can't believe you either. Believe me, I feel that something's wrong with me. —It's true. —You're fine. —I'm really fine? —You are fine... Glad to hear that. Mr Kwan, it seems that you are the cause of what happened tonight. No way. Where is the house she mentioned? That night I went to visit my girlfriend, her whole family lives there. There's no reason I would talk to the air. Great then. I'll leave now. Let's go. Wait, am I really okay? —Yes... —Sure? But I still feel that there's something extra on my body. Who is that? Take this! Why did you hit me? I brought you some cakes, that's all. Thank you. I feel something's wrong. You mean last night? Everyone was possessed. But when we arrived at Kwan's place, everything returned to normal. —He was not possessed. —What do you mean? Let's go to his place. Master, is there any evil energy? Unbelievable. I've searched high and low for this movie, Let's Do It in Someone Else's House. To think I found it here. This is said to be the most classic Japanese adult movie. And without pixelisation censorship too. Terrific! —I left it here. —Oh, you like it too? Yes. May I borrow it? —Sure. —Thanks. Master, back to what we came here for, do you see something in here? You mean friends from the underworld? —Yes. —It's yet to be known. How is it? I've found something! Because the needle is spinning? It's spinning fast! I'm afraid you're wrong. I wanted to create the atmosphere. I made it spin with a magnet, so we won't be nervous. —You're making a fool of me? —I dare not, Master. I did that just to help you relax. Throw away the magnet at once! Yes, Master. It's not me. How is it, Master? Are there really friends from the underworld? —What is it? —A paper suit. I don't believe it. Kwan, you must believe this. I've mentioned in my programme. Love between a human and a ghost is like masturbation. Basically it won't hurt your body. But you're over thirty years old, you mustn't do this anymore. I can't accept this. Because I can feel that Faith is very real. She can't be a ghost. How do you explain the paper suit? You brought the paper suit here. I just don't believe the two of you. Especially after you messed up my place like this. This is Post-modern Anti-ghost Tactic. I designed it. No ghosts of any religion can get inside here. Really? Come here. I want to ask you one thing. Ghosts of which religion will fear you? Sino Centre is never haunted as they sell my photos there. Even a painter must sign his name on his painting. I've designed such a creative tactic. How could I not leave my photo here? Is that so? Registered mail, please sign for it. —Thanks. —Give me back the pen. That foreigner really mailed me the photos. What photos? One night, Faith and I met a foreign couple who took some photos of us. Do you believe it now? It's a special effect, even Spielberg's films have this. Listen, how could Faith be a ghost? She has a grandmother and two brothers. How could the whole family be ghosts? What's so strange about that? Since you don't believe, there's only one way to prove it. Go to Faith's home one night. Drip some cow tear in your eyes. What's the use? Once human eyes come into contact with cow tear... he will be able to see ghosts. Spielberg doesn't have this stuff. Kwan, look. After you transferred blood to her and left... her condition became stable. Then we transferred her to St. Mary's Hospital. The next day, she died of complications. —Impossible! —It's all in the report. The hospital must have made a mistake, I'll check tomorrow. You're still so stubborn? Use my cow tear, Care Kwan. What's wrong with you today? You seem uneasy. Nothing. —I feel a bit unwell. —Do you? Let me get you some balm. No, it's okay. What did you come here for? I want to put something here for a while. —Can I? —What is it? I want to put this here for a while, okay? —What is inside? —Don't ask. Give it back to me in the future when I ask you to. Why so mysterious? —Hey, let's play mahjong. —Come on. Okay. Let's play mahjong. Drip some cow tear in your eyes... then you'll be able to see ghosts. —I want to go to the washroom. —Over there. Are you all right? Are you okay? Are you really okay? Then let's continue the mahjong game. Is the TV very noisy? I'll turn it off. You have a chance to win, let's go. I discarded West. I am sorry... I win. Sorry... What's wrong with you? You're sweating so much. Are you feeling unwell? Stop the game, go home for a rest now. Sure. Why are you leaving so soon? I haven't paid you yet. Thanks. So much money! Goodbye. You don't have to pull so hard. —I will definitely let you go. —I know... What do you know? I know nothing. You said you know. What do you know? I really know nothing! I don't know. He knows. He saw everything. Leave now. I see nothing. I really see nothing! Master, you've stuck amulets outside and this Cross and Bible here. Can you manage? There are different styles and different tactics. If she believes in Buddhism, my tools outside can stop her. If not, I have other tools when she comes inside. What if she believes in Islam? Islam doesn't believe in ghosts. But I want to go to the toilet, Master, what religion should I believe in? What do you mean by this? What does it mean? I'm helping you, I fear you'll be harmed by ghosts. I've been upset all evening. I believe Faith won't come to harm us. Why are you trying so hard to stop her from coming in? Ghosts and triads are similar in nature. They can get along with you when there's no conflict. But once there's conflict, they'll show their evil face, Care Kwan. —But I'm on good terms with her. —What do you want then? Kwan! Stop it! Kwan, stop doing this, okay? —Are you mad? —I'm very normal. Is there any reason to stop Faith from coming here? It'll be disastrous if she comes here. What's so disastrous about that? She'll strangle you to death. She'll push you off the building. She'll enchant you and hang you to death. She'll suck all your blood, rape you and then kill you. —I won't. —You won't? Especially the last thing you mentioned. Faith, I'm sorry. —Forgive me. —It's okay. Amitabha... Since you're on good terms... I'll spare you since Heaven always tries to be merciful. Just take your time to chat, I'll mail you the bill later. Goodbye. —Excuse me. —What if I don't? Just pretend I never said it. Amitabha... You put up those amulets? Granny, how do you know? I was just kidding. You've drawn them all wrong. You're familiar with this field. I won't draw them wrong next time. You stuck those amulets trying to harm my granddaughter? No, I used those amulets as wallpaper. Granny, don't get me wrong. You said I am a triad member? Of course not. I've never seen a granny in the triads. Granny, we did stir up some trouble. But I hope you will forgive me. —No. —Don't keep saying the opposite. I mean it! Granny! Help! On the night you gave me your blood, I was already dead. —I know. —I didn't commit suicide. —You mean... —Someone pushed me down. —Who did it? —My boss, Tinson Kei. That time we saw his car by the seaside. That was him. The floppy disk I gave you that evening... contains evidence of his weapon smuggling business. Weapon smuggling? He makes use of his freight company as a cover. I found this by chance, so I copied it onto a disk. But he found out about it. That night, he sent some guys to my home. They captured all of us and fed us poison. They took me to the rooftop and threw me down. At that moment, I was very angry... Right when I stopped breathing... I found myself levitating. I levitated to the ceiling of the Emergency Room. I saw myself, and the doctors who were trying to rescue me. It was only then that I knew I was dead. So you came to me, hoping that I would expose his crime for you. —You'll run into danger. —I am not afraid. I will help you get revenge. Read the contents of the disk first. Where are you going? I have to go now. Faith! Don't go. I'll come again when I need help. Faith has gone? Faith has gone, so why don't you leave too, Granny? —I can't bear to leave you. —Are you kidding? Leslie, you should've come out earlier. I used my Thunder Fist and smashed granny's soul, but you missed it. I haven't left yet. I can't bear to leave you. I've possessed him to accompany you, kid. Don't be afraid. —Come on, look at me. —Sorry, granny... Her boss is really evil. He seems to be doing freight business, but actually he's smuggling weapons. And the volumes are huge. Even the TV news have reported this... saying Customs found a huge amount of weapon spare parts. But judging from this, that case was only the tip of the iceberg. No wonder he had to kill Faith, he's too cruel. I want to find Lui Kong. Are you kidding? He's so incompetent. Those viewers believe him. I think only he can get revenge for Faith. Dear viewers, Changing Your Faith is here again. Today, we have the honour to invite a man... whose physiognomy all fortune-tellers in HK think is the best. He is Mr Tinson Kei, the magnate of the shipping industry. —How do you do, Mr Kei? —How do you do? Thank you for coming to our show, Mr Kei. Mr Kei will be running for Legislative Council next year... so it's good for him to have more exposure. Let's discuss the main topic, shall we? You've been enjoying a boom in your business. Have you made use of feng shui or anything to help you? We need ability and vision in doing business. I don't really believe in feng shui. Really? Honestly, being a host for so long, I've never flattered others. Mr Kei, you don't look good. Your head appears to be dark... while your forehead looks dull. It forecasts bad luck. I don't believe in this stuff. I have a feeling. There's an uninvited guest in this studio. What did you say? She's an unusual friend. And she followed you here. What is he saying? She said someone threw her off the roof. It's very painful. Director... can you stop rolling? —Commercial break. —Okay. Boss, you're afraid? When you killed my whole family and threw me off the roof... were you afraid at all? What are you talking about? I am Faith Ching. Don't try to be funny. I know you smuggle weapons, so you killed me. Sorry, Mr Kei. Master Lui, what are you up to? The friend has left, the ratings must be soaring tonight. We're in trouble, Chuen will definitely chew our heads off. He doesn't have to leave if he's innocent. —Master Lui, your call. —Thanks. Master, you're good! How did you make Faith possess you? You think I'm a medium? It's not easy to be possessed. I was only pretending, but he thought it was real. I think this case is real. What does that mean? Report it to the police, dummy! This guy can't be clean, it's not a simple case. Earning your $100,000 is quite risky. Talk to you again. I don't fear ghosts, I only fear humans. You guys are useless. You killed her family, but failed to get back the disk. We tortured each of them that evening. We turned the place upside down, but we couldn't find the disk. I'm worried that someone found the disk... then pretended to be possessed to blackmail me. Lui Kong must be one of them. Send some guys to question him. I don't care what you do. I must know what's going on. Make a call to Thai-Woman. Ask her to come on the first flight tomorrow. Yes, Mr Kei. Wait, ask her to bring Tajba as well. Yes. You're pretty. Didn't you say you'd tell my fortune? You have to take off all your clothes before I can do that. Your waist is... I am mesmerized by you. Cut the crap, what do you want? Come to my home, I have a 1982 red wine. All my colleagues are here, how can I leave? Why don't we go to the back? Morally, I can't accept your invitation... but your sexy figure beats my morality. What are we waiting for? Under Maintenance You really know how it's done. Can't you read? I heard that you have magic powers, you'd better invite a god to help you. Wait, tell me what you want. I'm a man without principles. Mr Kei believes that you know a lot of things. I'll definitely tell you whatever you want to know. Who asked you to invite Mr Kei? —A ghost. It's true. —What? Ghost... I am a bit worried. Why? I fear Tinson Kei will come and kill you. But I don't think he can do whatever he pleases. No, I have a feeling something is going to happen. He killed your family, so I must expose his crime. I've an appointment with the police. I'll tell them about this tomorrow. I fear no one will believe you. I will try my best. Care, don't leave me. It's really spooky here. All the ghosts will run away once they see me. It's very eerie here. Two male, two female, one very old... and three young. Are they really so powerful? They are here. You not only killed us all... now you're even trying to get rid of us again? You're a clever ghost. Where is the justice if you can win? Let me tell you, there's no justice in this world... as long as you have Tajba with you. Go back to where you belong! Lui Kong, you've already been beaten up. You might as well help Kwan again, right? Okay. Let's rush to Faith's home. Faith! Faith! It's burnt so badly. —Who is so powerful? —Master. What's happened, Master? You're so transparent. When you need me, you call me Master. When you don't, you call me a swindler. I beg you. Please rescue Faith. Let me try to call her soul. Leslie, get me a chicken. Without bird-flu of course. How would I know if it's infected? You're a doctor, measure its body temperature and you'll know. Master, what is this? It's the high-tech era now. Usually there are four or five monks. I wonder if you can manage alone. The economy is bad, one person is enough. My merciful Buddha. Please help me. My merciful Buddha. My merciful Buddha. Master, what now? The chicken has fallen asleep. I've been chanting since 1:00 am... and now it's 3:00 am. Even a human will fall asleep, let alone the chicken. —What do you mean? —I've failed to find her soul. I suspect they have asked... some powerful evil master to obliterate their souls. That's why I failed to find their souls. It's too bad. Kwan... calm down! Kwan, don't scare me. Granny and the brothers left some burnt marks... but why didn't Faith? Why, Master? Master, why? Faith believes in Jesus! She doesn't believe in soul smashing and stuff. I think she's still inside this house. Why didn't she show up? I... I know. Master performed the Chinese style, so she didn't show up. —That's easy. —Right, Master? My merciful Lord, I beg you to bring Faith's soul back to this home. Home! A guy here misses her so much. Amen. I will follow you... Master, it's hard to follow you. You have to be commercial enough to make a living. But it's still not working. Let me finish it. Kwan, are you crazy? Why did you cut your wrist? I transferred blood to Faith, she has my blood in her body. I can help her by bleeding. Are you nuts? You think you're Jesus? Wait, cutting your wrist means sacrifice, it may work. Guys who fail to woo girls cut their wrists too. His blood is enough to woo ten girls. Call an ambulance at once! I won't leave until Faith appears! Calm down, Kwan! Come and help! —I fear blood! —Kwan! Go to the hospital now. Faith... Kwan, I couldn't come out if not for your blood. The judgment will soon take place. Who will be judged? Tinson Kei. At the flat where the doctor committed suicide... some mysterious murders occurred a month ago. A girl called Ching is suspected of being a lunatic... and poisoning her two brothers and grandmother. Then she drugged herself and jumped off the building. Police is still checking the relationship between the doctor and the girl. Luckily Kwan donated some blood to the Red Cross before... if not, he'd be in big trouble. Care Kwan. I'm sorry that this has happened to you. Please wake up soon. Why are you staring at Kwan like you're gay? Shut up! Don't disturb this great, heaven-envied and bloody human-ghost love affair. Human-ghost love affair? What are you talking about? I only see a fat and dark guy lying there. Don't scare me. It's true, don't blame her. There are many ghosts behind you. It's true, you'd better leave. —Don't scare me. —Leave now. They're coming. Wait. —What is it? —You feel evil energy again? My feet are numb. It's okay now, let's go. Hold Tajba properly. You needn't remind me of that. You say that doctor is related to the ghost of Faith. What shall we do then? This ghost is being controlled by my Tajba. If there's no blood to help her... she can't come out from it at all. They must have love between them. Catch that doctor, and we can find the ghost easily. Nurse, where's Doctor Kwan's ward? It's ward 435. —Thanks. —You're welcome. She said ward 435, where is he? Are you looking for someone? We want to see Doctor Kwan. He died. There's no dead body smell here. Don't tell lies to me. Go take a look in the mortuary if you don't believe me. I don't need to check there. I've never seen such a thick sheet. Close the door! —What are you doing? —How dare you lie to me! What do you mean? I said what Lui Kong asked me to say. —Where's Lui Kong? —Did you hear him? I'll be betraying him if I tell you. You're betraying yourself if you don't tell me. You can never guess where he is. Unless he is here. You're smart, you managed to find me here. Mr Kei, frankly speaking, you and I are not rivals. I did invite you on my show, but that ghost won't let you off. Why not let me help you to get rid of that ghost? I can do that easily, right? If you do, I'll lose my job, right? You mustn't say so, Aunt. King, kill that long-winded guy. You can't do that, aunt. Wait, you mustn't do this. Throw him down! And then the fat guy. I am very slim. Stop torturing them, I'm the one you want. Hang him upside down from the roof. I'll see if the ghost comes to rescue you or not. No... No! Don't throw Kwan down! No. Let him go. I beg you. You've finally showed up. Faith! What can you do to me? Go away, Faith, go! Faith, go! Go! Don't pull me! Go away! Old hag, what can you do now? My Tajba... —Tajba... —King... let's go! Where can you go? I'm Faith's elder brother! Help... Right, throw her down. —Sure. —No... help... I'll help you deal with Mr Kei now. Darn! You're just paying lip service. Throw her down! —Yes! —Help. Why did you hit me? You're a ghost! You're possessed, I know. I am not possessed! You look like you're possessed! She isn't possessed. How do you know? Because I am possessed! Faith, I beg you to spare me. Faith, spare me. I cannot do harm to you and I don't have supernatural power. But you did so many evil things, you'll have your retribution. I beg you to spare me. Spare me. I beg you... Why did you kill us all then? There's a door over there, I'll let you go. —Go now. —Thanks. No! Where's that bad guy? He fell to his death. Amitabha, all must be paid. If not today, then read Oriental Daily tomorrow. Faith is gone. Doctor Kwan is standing there again. When it rains at night, he'll stand there. He hopes Faith will walk in here one day. He's deeply in love with her. He's like the guy in the movie Titanic. He'll freeze to death. Come on. Faith... I've come to see a doctor. Faith. My name isn't Faith, I haven't seen you before. Sorry, miss. I might have mistaken you for someone else. I am a doctor at this hospital. What's wrong with you? Let me do a check-up for you. Come on.
