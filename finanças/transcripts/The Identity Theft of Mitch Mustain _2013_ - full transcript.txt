** [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MAN SHOUTING ON TV] ALL RIGHT, YOU READY TO PASS? ALL RIGHT, YOU READY TO PASS? [NARRATOR] MITCHELL STEWART MUSTAIN WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KID GROWING UP. HE LIKED PLAYING BALL, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT KIDS DO. THEY GO OUTSIDE, AND THEY PLAY BALL. AND NO MATTER THE SPORT. PARENTS WILL ENCOURAGE THEIR KIDS TO PARTICIPATE. BECAUSE SPORTS ARE GOOD. THEY TEACH STRUCTURE. THEY TEACH DISCIPLINE. THEY TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY NICE WITH OTHERS. HOW TO PICK YOURSELF UP. BUT ABOVE ALL, THEY TEACH TOGETHERNESS. NO ONE KID MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER. NO "I" IN TEAM. AND EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY. BUT BEFORE LONG, SOMEONE'S GONNA START TO KEEP SCORE. AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS WILL CHANGE. CERTAIN KIDS WILL BEGIN TO OUTSHINE THEIR TEAMMATES. THEY'LL RUN FASTER, THEY'LL JUMP HIGHER, AND THEY'LL THROW HARDER. AND IT WILL COME NATURALLY FOR THEM. THAT'S THE UNFAIR PART. AND FOR THOSE GIFTED ONES, THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT THING, THEY'LL HAVE THE TIME OF THEIR LIFE. THEIR HOMETOWNS WILL PRAISE THEM. YOUNG KIDS WILL ASK THEM FOR AUTOGRAPHS. REPORTERS WILL EARN A LIVING BY CHASING AFTER THEM. CHEERLEADERS WILL FLIRT. AND NO ONE WILL TELL THEM NO. THEIR PARENTS WILL TAKE BRAGGING RIGHTS. RETIRED MEN WILL DISCUSS THEM OVER COFFEE. WHILE HAS-BEEN ATHLETES WILL DISMISS THEM, OVER BEER. OTHERS WILL CHOOSE TO MENTOR THEM. COACH THEM. LIVE THROUGH THEM FROM THE SIDELINES. AND THESE HOMETOWN HEROES, THEY'LL BE LEFT TO TRY AND MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL. MITCH MUSTAIN TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES. HE TOOK TO FOOTBALL. IT CAME NATURALLY. BUT TO SAY THAT HE WAS MERELY A HOMETOWN HERO, WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME. BECAUSE WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS, MITCH MUSTAIN WAS SHAPED INTO ONE OF THE MOST DECORATED HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS IN AMERICA. [DAD] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MUDDY, IT'S FOOTBALL! [NARRATOR] WHETHER HE ASKED FOR IT, OR NOT. [MITCH MUSTAIN] YEAH, I MEAN I CAN CERTAINLY LOOK BACK AT MY CHILDHOOD NOW, GROWING UP AND THINK THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY A PATH FROM THE TIME I WAS 4 OR 5 YEARS OLD. I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND IT. BUT YOU COULD ARGUE, YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT AND ARGUE THAT YEAH, THERE WAS CERTAINLY A PATH THAT WAS ALREADY KIND OF BEATEN A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY EXCEPTIONAL ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD. IN TERMS OF LIKE, SPORTS TRAINING. I WASN'T GROOMED TO BE A QUARTERBACK. IT CAME EASY. IT JUST CAME KIND OF NATURAL TO ME. THE AWARDS, I DIDN'T REALIZE WERE EVEN THERE. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU COULD WIN LIKE THE GATORADE AWARD, THE PARADE AWARD. THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND I THINK EVEN THEN, WHEN ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING, I DIDN'T-- IT WASN'T REALLY IMPRESSED UPON ME. I MEAN, AGAIN, I DIDN'T REALLY, I GUESS WE'D SAY, SEEK IT OUT. WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD, I WANTED TO BE IN THE MILITARY. I WANTED TO BE A FIGHTER PILOT. I WANTED TO DO ADVENTUROUS THINGS. TO PLAY QUARTERBACK IN COLLEGE, IT WAS NOT MY DREAM. THIS WASN'T IT. AND IT CERTAINLY BEGS THE QUESTION, OF WHETHER... WHETHER I MISSED SOMETHING OR WHETHER I JUST WENT THE COMPLETELY WRONG DIRECTION. BUT OUT BEYOND ALL THAT, THE DECISIONS I MADE, THE DIRECTIONS I WENT, WERE MINE TO MAKE. LET'S BRING IN, ONE OF OUR COLLEGE FOOTBALL ANALYSTS, AND THAT IS JOE SCHAD. JOE, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US... YOU KNOW, MY WIFE WAS ASKING ME LAST NIGHT, YOU KNOW, WHO WAS MITCH MUSTAIN. AND I SAID, "WELL, HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE QUARTERBACK IN THE NATION." AND HE BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A COLLEGE QUARTERBACK WITH EIGHT CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES. AND SHE SAID, "OKAY, AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?" AND I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW." YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. IF THIS WAS JUST ABOUT MITCH MUSTAIN GOING OUT THERE, AND GOING 8-0 AND GETTING BENCHED AND SCREWING UP ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD AND TRANSFERRING AND SCREWING UP OFF THE FIELD. AND NOT BECOMING... THERE'S A MILLION OF THOSE GUYS. OUT THERE THAT WERE VERY PROMISING AND JUST DIDN'T MAKE IT. BUT THE INTRIGUING PART OF IT IS, IS THAT THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT MORE TO THE STORY THAN JUST MITCH MUSTAIN NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. HE WASN'T NAMED THE "NATIONAL PLAYER OF THE YEAR" IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR NOTHING. HE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD WITH HIS ARM, OR WITH HIS LEGS. THERE WERE VERY FEW THINGS THAT HE COULD NOT CONTROL. I MEAN IT'S, IT'S ALMOST HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THAT HIS WENT DOWN. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN WHY HE NEVER FULFILLED ALL THE PROMISE THAT WAS IN HIS RIGHT ARM. [NARRATOR] NOW IF YOU'RE NOT FROM ARKANSAS, YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT THIS STORY MEANT. BUT NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM, OR WHERE YOU'RE AT, WE ALL LIKE HEROES. AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IT SEEMED WE HAD IT. YOU KNOW, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY, IT REALLY DIDN'T-- I DON'T THINK STARTED TO SHOW UNTIL PROBABLY EIGHTH GRADE. SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT RECOLLECTION OF IT. COACHES THAT I HAD, I COULDN'T, I COULDN'T SAY. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I WAS THE QUARTERBACK FULL-TIME. AND SO THAT, I THINK THAT'S WHY I THINK OF IT THAT WAY. WHERE I KIND OF CAME ABOUT. SO HOW OLD WOULD I HAVE BEEN, 13? THAT'S WHEN THINGS KIND OF TOOK OFF. MITCHELL MUSTAIN, NUMBER SEVEN, QUARTERBACK. * BIG FAME * BIG FAME * GET ON MY LEVEL * GET ON MY LEVEL * BIG FAME [MUSTAIN] I HAVE A HARD TIME REMEMBERING THAT FAR BACK BUT CERTAINLY, I MEAN EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER I'VE ENJOYED PLAYING IT. I DON'T THINK I HAD... I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FORMAL INSTRUCTION IN FOOTBALL UNTIL PRIOR TO MY JUNIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. I GUESS WHENEVER HE GOT HIS FIRST SCHOLARSHIP OFFER, IS KIND OF WHEN I REALIZED-- THERE'S POTENTIAL THERE. THEY WENT OFF TO HOOVER, ALABAMA FOR A 7 ON 7 TOURNAMENT. I GUESS RIGHT BEFORE HIS JUNIOR YEAR. JUST OUT OF THE BLUE I WAS COMING BACK, I WAS DRIVING BACK FROM A 7 ON 7 TOURNAMENT IN HOOVER ALABAMA, THAT WE JUST WON, GOT A PHONE CALL. THIS WAS LONG BEFORE I HAD GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO PLAYING FOOTBALL IN COLLEGE OR EVEN KNEW IF I HAD THE TIME. I HADN'T STARTED A HIGH SCHOOL GAME YET. AND THEN RIGHT AFTER THAT IS WHEN THINGS KIND OF STARTED PICKING UP. AS FAR AS, LETTERS COMING IN, SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS. DIFFERENT COACHES, SCHOOLS CALLING. IT GOT REALLY CRAZY REALLY QUICK AFTER THAT. I HAD JUST COME BACK, I HAD BEEN WORKING NEWS FOR A WHILE. CAME BACK, GOT BACK INTO SPORTS. I THINK IT WAS BEFORE I'D EVEN GONE OVER TO THE SCHOOL. THAT I HAD SOMEONE WITHIN THE OFFICE TELL ME, THEY'VE GOT THIS KID COMING UP WHO'S THE REAL DEAL. AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THE NAME, MITCH MUSTAIN. I CAN REMEMBER JUST HEARING ABOUT IT AND THEN SEEING IT AND SEEING IT SOME MORE. PROBABLY FOR ME, IT WAS HIS JUNIOR YEAR. I WAS AT KNWA, AND WHEN I GOT THE JOB THERE THE IDEA WAS WE WERE GOING TO OWN THE RAZORBACK COVERAGE. WE WERE GONNA DO A BETTER JOB THAN ANYBODY ELSE, COVERING THE RAZORBACKS. IN OTHER WORDS, WE WEREN'T GONNA COVER EVERYTHING. YOU MIGHT HAVE THIS GREAT HIGH SCHOOL STORY OVER HERE, BUT WE WEREN'T COVERING THAT. WELL, HERE COMES THIS KID IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S CHANGING OUR PHILOSOPHY. HIS COACH, GUS MALZAHN HAD ARRANGED FOR A TELEVISED SATURDAY GAME THIS WAS THE FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON, OF THE 2004 SEASON. AND IT WAS GONNA BE ON TELEVISION, AND EVANGEL HAD THIS REPUTATION OF BEING KIND OF A FOOTBALL FACTORY. HERE IS EVANGEL WHO... THEY'RE A POWERHOUSE IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA, OUT OF SHREVEPORT. AND THEY'RE NATIONALLY RANKED YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. YOU KNOW WHEN EVANGEL CHRISTIAN COMES UP, FROM SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA TO PLAY SPRINGDALE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ON THE MAP. I ACTUALLY CAME BACK AND SAW AND WATCHED THE GAME. I WENT AND WATCHED THEM PLAY. [CROWD CHEERS] [ANNOUNCER] THE ICONIC HIGH SCHOOL COACH, GUS MALZAHN AND THE MUCH ANTICIPATED DEBUT OF THE JUNIOR, MITCH MUSTAIN. IF YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN, HE'S ALREADY BEEN OFFERED A SCHOLARSHIP BEFORE HE EVER PLAYED A DOWN ON-- BEFORE HE EVER PLAYED A DOWN ON THE VARSITY LEVEL. OFFERED A SCHOLARSHIP BY RAZORBACK HEAD COACH HOUSTON NUTT-- COACH HOUSTON NUTT, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. HOUSTON NUTT TOLD ME ONE TIME WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MITCH MUSTAIN, I HAD ASKED HIM SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HE SAID, "MITCH MUSTAIN WOULD BE THE BEST QUARTERBACK ON OUR CAMPUS RIGHT NOW, EVERYBODY KNEW IT. THERE WAS A LOT OF HYPE ABOUT THIS. AND I DIDN'T KNOW MITCH FROM SQUAT. HE DIDN'T PLAY THE YEAR BEFORE, AND I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO JUNIOR, I'VE NEVER GONE TO JUNIOR HIGH GAMES. AND I DIDN'T GO TO THE GAME, I WATCHED IT ON TELEVISION. [ANNOUNCER] THE OFFENSE IS CLICKING BEHIND THE JUNIOR, MITCH MUSTAIN. A YOUNG MAN WHO'S SPENT HIS LAST TWO YEARS PLAYING ON THE FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE TEAMS, LEARNING THE MALZAHN SYSTEM. LEADING THEM BOTH TO UNDEFEATED SEASONS. MUSTAIN ON THE KEEPER. IT'S A FOOT RACE. AND A FOOT RACE HE WILL WIN. TOUCHDOWN. 67 YARDS ON THE TOUCHDOWN RUN BY MITCH MUSTAIN. IT WAS EASY TO BELIEVE AT THAT POINT, IT WAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HYPE WAS ALL ABOUT. [ANNOUNCER] WHAT A WAY TO DEBUT. HE'S GONNA HAVE A 300-YARD DAY. IN RUSH FOR NEARLY 100 YARDS, 67 BIG ONES THERE. TAKE A LOOK AT MITCH MUSTAIN. HIS SECOND RUSHING TOUCHDOWN. AND THERE GOING UP TOP. FINDS THE OPEN MAN. HE THROWS FOR A COUPLE, AND RUSHES FOR A COUPLE. GUS MALZAHN COULDN'T HAVE DREAMED MITCH WOULD HAVE A DEBUT LIKE HE DID TODAY. IT LOOKS MORE AND MORE LIKE THIS SPRINGDALE FIVE IS LEGIT. SO IT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR US, MY FIRST START. AND... IT ENDED UP, WE HAD A REAL GOOD GAME AGAINST THEM. IT WENT ON. WON, IT WAS 12 STRAIGHT. AND THEN I HAD TO PLAY LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL. IN LITTLE ROCK. FIRST PLAY OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF THAT GAME I BROKE MY ARM. I WAS OUT FOR THAT. MISSED THE REST OF THAT GAME. WE LOST. AND THAT WAS IT FOR THAT SEASON. [NARRATOR] SO EVEN WITH A FRACTURED RIGHT ARM, MITCHELL'S FUTURE WOULD BE FOCUSED UPON. I FOUND IT AMAZING JUST HOW MUCH INTEREST ON WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM, AND HIS REHABILITATION. WAS HE GONNA BE ABLE TO PLAY AGAIN? WHAT WAS HIS FUTURE. THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK IN THE OFF-SEASON, THAT HE HAD SURGERY, THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME. WOULD HE OKAY, HOW WOULD THAT PLATE IN HIS ARM, HOW WOULD THOSE SCREWS REACT? COULD HE GRIP THE BALL? I MEAN, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. I BROKE MY ARM, I BELIEVE IT WAS NOVEMBER 26TH. I STARTED THROWING AGAIN IN FEBRUARY. AND WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. AND AS WE GOT CLOSER TO SPRING FOOTBALL OF THAT YEAR, I STARTED TO REALIZE THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST HERE. FOR ME, I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I'D BE ABLE TO PERFORM, THAT WE'D BE AN EVEN BETTER TEAM THAN WE WERE IN '04. REALLY JUST WANTED TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD AND PROVE THAT. I REMEMBER WE SENT A CREW TO COVER THEIR 7 ON 7 TOURNAMENTS IN THE SUMMER. GOOD EVENING EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO A SUMMER WITH SPRINGDALE. OVER THE NEXT TWO NIGHTS WE WILL TAKE YOU INSIDE THE BULLDOG PROGRAM. AND GIVE YOU AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT THEIR CROSS COUNTRY 7 ON 7 FOOTBALL TOUR. FROM LOS ANGELES TO ALABAMA, ALL IN AN EFFORT TO SHOW THE COUNTRY, JUST HOW GOOD THEY ARE. IT WAS A REALLY FUN EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE TO SEE WHAT WE WERE DOING, AND WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT. BECAUSE WE WERE WHAT PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR. THE COACHES STARTED TO SHOW UP. LARRY COKER, WHO WAS A HEAD COACH AT MIAMI SHOWED UP. MACK BROWN CAME UP FROM TEXAS. CHARLIE WEIS SHOWED UP FROM NOTRE DAME. THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED AROUND HERE BEFORE. AND I THINK CAUSED A PROBLEM FOR HOUSTON NUTT, I THINK HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THAT. YOU SUDDENLY GOT THIS TALENT IN YOUR BACKYARD, EVERYBODY EXPECTS YOU TO GET HIM. BUT YOU GOT TREMENDOUS COMPETITION. I MEAN IT'S HEAD COACH, AFTER HEAD COACH COMING TO SPRINGDALE, ARKANSAS. NINE MILES DOWN THE ROAD IS THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS. I CAN REMEMBER HOUSTON NUTT TOOK ALL OF HIS COACHES, TO SPRINGDALE PRACTICE ONE DAY, BECAUSE FLORIDA, OR SOMEBODY WAS GONNA-- OKLAHOMA MAYBE, WAS GONNA HAVE FOUR COACHES THERE. SO THEY TOOK THEIR WHOLE STAFF, TO MAKE SURE THEY OUT NUMBERED OKLAHOMA'S COACHING STAFF IN SPRINGDALE THAT DAY. OFFERS START COMING IN, COACHES START COMING TO SPRING PRACTICE, AND WATCHING SUMMER AND ALL THAT STUFF. A LOT OF THEM OFF THE BAT, WERE SCHOOLS I KNEW I WASN'T INTERESTED IN, I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO. SO THAT WAS EASY TO RULE OUT. THERE WERE SEVERAL THAT I WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN. THAT HAD GOOD PROGRAMS, WERE NICE PLACES. I JUST HEARD RUMORS ABOUT THE KID. "OH, HE'S GOT THE BIG HEAD. HE'S GOING TO TEXAS. WHAT KIND OF A KID FROM SPRINGDALE, ARKANSAS, NINE MILES FROM RAZORBACK STADIUM WANTS TO BE A LONGHORN?" HE'S INTERESTED IN NOTRE DAME, HE'S INTERESTED IN MICHIGAN. HE'S GONE BIG TIME ON US. THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET HIM. AND IT'S HIS MOTHER, TOO, BECAUSE HIS MOTHER DOESN'T WANT HIM TO GO THERE. HIS MOTHER HAS A CRUSH ON MACK BROWN. MACK BROWN SENT HIS MOTHER FLOWERS ON HER BIRTHDAY. AND SHE'S JUST SMITTEN WITH THIS GUY. SO MITCH IS GONNA GO THERE. EVERYWHERE YOU WENT, YOU HEARD THESE RUMORS. AND I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED WHEN HE SUDDENLY CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE AND ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO ARKANSAS. I WAS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED HERE? I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING ANYWHERE BUT ARKANSAS. YOU HAD LIVE TIE-INS FROM TV STATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WATCHING. YOU CAN SAY, EQUAL PARTS RELIEF AND EUPHORIA THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR HIM I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE MORE RELIEF. I'VE DECIDED TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS -AND BE A RAZORBACK. -[AUDIENCE CHEERS] -I'M SO HAPPY! WHOO! -[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] [NARRATOR] AND WITH THOSE FEW WORDS MITCHELL MUSTAIN BECAME THE PRODIGAL SON OF ARKANSAS. I GREW UP HERE, LISTENING TO ARKANSAS FOOTBALL. ON THE RADIO, TO PAUL EELLS. WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE ABOUT IT? YOU GREW UP IN THE STATE IT'S THE ONLY SCHOOL IN THE STATE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SCHOOL YOU GO TO, YOU FOLLOW THE RAZORBACKS. YOU HAVE ARKANSAS STICKERS, IT'S ODD FOR THAT. YOU GO TO CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE SC STICKERS, AND UCLA FANS, AND ALL THAT. THEY'RE DIVIDED. AND YOU GO TO ALABAMA, AND THEY'RE DIVIDED. YOU GO TO MISSISSIPPI AND THEY'RE DIVIDED. EVERYWHERE HAS BIG TIME PROGRAMS, WHERE THE FAN BASE IS DIVIDED, ARKANSAS ISN'T LIKE THAT. THAT'S A SELLING POINT. THAT'S A SELLING POINT THAT EVERY COACH THAT'S EVER COACHED AT THE UNIVERSITY IS WHEN YOU COME HERE, YOU'RE THE DALLAS COWBOYS, THERE'S NOBODY ELSE IN THE STATE. UNLESS YOU'RE FROM HERE, UNLESS YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE. YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. SO I COMMITTED TO ARKANSAS AND THAT WAS THAT. IT WAS VERY MUCH A CELEBRATED DAY THAT THIS, ONE OF THE TOP QUARTERBACKS IN THE COUNTRY WAS GONNA STAY-- STAY HOME, AND PLAY FOR HIS HOMETOWN TEAM. I JUST WANTED TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY, GET IT DONE. AND GET BACK ON THE FIELD AND... REALLY MORE THAN ANYTHING, TEST MYSELF AGAIN. I BROKE MY ARM THE LAST PLAY I'D EVER PLAYED IN. WE COME IN, WE GO DOWN TO SHREVEPORT. WE BEAT THEM THE YEAR BEFORE, I THINK THEY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF HURT PRIDE. AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDEFEATED. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THAT TEAM THAT WAS ONE FOR THE AGES AT THAT POINT. IT WAS JUST LIKE THE YEAR BEFORE, IT WAS 90 SOME ODD DEGREES, 100 DEGREES, WHATEVER IT WAS. REALLY HOT. ON THE TURF. THE GAME WAS NO LET DOWN. THERE WAS NOTHING STELLAR, BUT FOR ME IT WAS A BIG GAME. BECAUSE IT WAS THE GAME WHERE, I HAD BEEN TACKLED, I HAD DONE QUARTERBACK DRAWS. AND GOT A FEW YARDS. GOT HIT, OKAY, MY ARM'S FINE. MY HEAD'S FINE. LET'S GO PLAY AND LET'S WIN. SO I REMEMBER PROBABLY THE MOST DISTINCT THING WAS JUST HOW THE NUMBERS KEPT PILING UP. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHO GUS MALZAHN IS. YOU KNOW THE SUCCESS THAT HE'S HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND IT WAS REALLY JUST SORT OF A PHENOMENON. ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT, EVERYBODY GOES AND WATCHES THEIR HIGH SCHOOL PLAY. BUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PARTICULAR HIGH SCHOOL, AND MAYBE EVEN IF YOU DID, YOU'D SNEAK OVER TO SPRINGDALE AND YOU'D WATCH A QUARTER OR HALF FOR THIS DAMIAN WILLIAMS GUY OR MITCH MUSTAIN. YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST TOO EASY. [BEN CLEVELAND] YOU KNOW OUR MINDSET GOING INTO IT EACH GAME WAS HOW FAST CAN WE GET TO THE MERCY RULE. IS IT HALF TIME, OR IS IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND QUARTER? HOW FAST CAN WE GET THIS GAME OVER WITH? [BO MATTINGLY] IT WAS JUST AN ENTERTAINMENT FACTOR FOR TWO YEARS... IN ARKANSAS. [CLINT STOERNER] WASN'T HARD TO BELIEVE, MAN, I MEAN, HE OBVIOUSLY DID SOME REAL SPECIAL THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS FUN TO WATCH. FRIDAY NIGHTS WERE WHERE WE WANTED TO BE. AND THAT WAS, THAT WAS OUR FUN. I MEAN IT WAS FUN BEING THAT GOOD. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO REMEMBER MOST ABOUT THIS YEAR? [MUSTAIN] MY TEAMMATES REALLY. YEARS FROM NOW I PROBABLY WON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE SCORE. BUT I'LL REMEMBER THEM. [REPORTER] YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT'S MITCH MUSTAIN. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE FINAL WORD, RIGHT AFTER THIS. [NARRATOR] SO WHILE MOST OF HIS CLASSMATES WERE BUSY BEING TEENAGERS, PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND SUCH. MITCHELL AND HIS TEAMMATES WERE THE VIDEO GAME. AND WHILE HIS CLASSMATES WERE BUSY READING PAPERBACK NOVELS, MITCHELL AND HIS TEAMMATES WERE HAVING BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT THEM. [KURT VOIGT] I THOUGHT YOU KNOW, OKAY IT'LL BE A NEAT LITTLE COFFEE TABLE TYPE BOOK ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. LET'S FACE IT, THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAD 35,000 PEOPLE AT THEIR STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. THEY HAD ATTENTION, UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION FOR A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM IN THIS STATE. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO. [NARRATOR] AND AS FOR MITCHELL HIMSELF, HIS SENIOR SEASON WOULD BE CAPPED OFF WITH AN AWARD TOUR. I, JERRE M. VAN HOOSE, MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SPRINGDALE, ARKANSAS. DO HEREBY DECLARE... AS... IT'S A DANG DAY DEDICATED TO HIM AT SPRINGDALE. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT'S MITCH. MITCH, MITCH, MITCH. A DISCLAIMER BEFORE OUR NEXT STORY, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR MORE MITCH MUSTAIN HYPE. THE INCOMING FRESHMAN QUARTERBACK MADE A TRIP TO HOLLYWOOD LAST WEEK TO ATTEND THE ESPY'S THAT AIR TONIGHT AFTER BEING NOMINATED FOR NATIONAL ATHLETE OF THE YEAR. ALL THESE AWARDS WERE BUILT UP, I HADN'T SEEN THE GUY CHANGE. I HADN'T SEEN HIS MIRROR CHANGE AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE. IS A QUARTERBACK. HE'S NOT A BIG HEADED PERSON, HE'S NOT A HOT EGO GUY. I LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM. AND I THINK HE'S VERY TEAMMATE ORIENTED. I LOVE THAT. TO ME THAT'S UNSELFISHNESS, THAT'S A GIVING HEART. HE HAS ALL THOSE QUALITIES TO MAKE A GREAT QUARTERBACK. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, "MITCH MUSTAIN THIS, MITCH MUSTAIN THAT" BUT IT DOESN'T GET OLD. YOU GIVE CREDIT WHEN CREDIT'S DUE. [NARRATOR] BUT WHILE THERE WAS PLENTY CALLS FOR CELEBRATION. THERE WERE ULTIMATELY COMPLICATIONS. THAT-- MALZAHN CALLED ME IN, I BELIEVE IT WAS THE DAY OF OUR CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. WE WERE IN LITTLE ROCK, IN THE HOTEL. HE CALLED ME INTO HIS ROOM AND JUST SAID, "HEY, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT ROY WITTKE THE QUARTERBACK COACH, THEY LET HIM GO." OKAY, I FORGOT ABOUT IT. WE WENT AND PLAYED THE GAME. HAD AN AWESOME NIGHT. AFTER THAT, I'M THINKING IF I'M A HEAD COACH AND I FIRE A QUARTERBACK COACH AND HE'S DEALING WITH ONE OF OUR RECRUITS, I'D PROBABLY MAKE A PHONE CALL OR HAVE SOMEBODY MAKE A PHONE CALL. AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I EXPECTED TO BE INFORMED OF EVERY DECISION OR BE A PRIMA DONNA ABOUT IT. IT'S JUST, I ALREADY HAVE SOME PRETTY BIG DOUBTS. NOBODY BOTHERED TO ASK MITCH. AND SUDDENLY ROY WITTKE IS FIRED. WELL, WAS IT ANY WONDER THIS KID DECOMMITTED? NOBODY HAD TALKED TO HIM. NOBODY ASKED HIM. [NARRATOR] MITCHELL HAD FIRST COMMITTED TO PLAY FOR THE RAZORBACKS BECAUSE HIS HEART TOLD HIM TO DO SO. BUT HIS GUT WAS NOW TELLING HIM TO LOOK AT HIS OPTIONS. I CALLED HOUSTON, AND MET WITH HIM IN PERSON. I TOLD HIM, "HEY, I DON'T KNOW WHO'S-- WHO I'M GONNA BE WORKING WITH. AND TO BE HONEST, I HAVE OPTIONS THAT I'M GONNA EXPLORE AGAIN" BECAUSE THERE'S STILL TWO MONTHS AT THAT POINT. AND I FELT IT WAS BEST FOR ME TO MOVE ON. I KNEW IT WAS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE OF HOW HIGHLY RATED HE WAS. I MEAN EVERYONE KNEW THE NUMBER OF AWARDS HE WON. EVERYONE KNEW WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE. HEY, THIS IS A KID WHO WAS RATED HIGHER THAN TIM TEBOW COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. THIS IS A KID WHO WENT TO THE ALL-AMERICAN GAME IN SAN ANTONIO. HE'S DOWN THERE WITH TEBOW. HE WAS THE ONE THAT NATIONAL MEDIA WAS FOLLOWING. SO TO THINK THAT MUSTAIN WAS CONSIDERED THE MORE ACCURATE PASSER, THE BETTER PRO PROSPECT, THE MORE READY-TO-PLAY QUARTERBACK. REALLY TELLS YOU JUST HOW HIGH THE EXPECTATIONS WERE. [REPORTER] TONIGHT ON "COUNTDOWN TO SIGNING DAY." THEY'RE TWO OF THE HIGHEST RATED QUARTERBACKS IN THE COUNTRY WHO COULD COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN YEARS TO COME. BUT ONLY ONE CAN BE NAMED FIRST TEAM ALSO. WHO WILL IT BE? I REALLY TRY NOT TO FOCUS ON THE RANKING. AT THAT POINT JUST KIND OF GOT BACK INTO THE RECRUITING SWING. HAD THE ARMY GAME COMING UP. THE LANDSCAPE HAD CHANGED A LITTLE BIT. IN TERMS OF WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE HAD GONE. SOME OF THE OTHER BIG NAME QUARTERBACKS, THEY'D ALL KIND OF SETTLED THEMSELVES. THERE WAS JUST A LOT GOING ON AT THAT POINT. I THINK MOST PEOPLE-- I WASN'T REALLY MAD OR UPSET, I WAS JUST KIND OF WONDERING, WHAT WAS GOING ON, WHAT WAS IN MY HEAD. ADMITTEDLY, I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE HELPED ME TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW, SO MANY COACHES AND SO MANY ATHLETES WILL TELL YOU, "I DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPER. I DON'T READ BLOGS. I DON'T LISTEN TO SPORTS TALK RADIO." OKAY, MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE LYING. THE DRAMA GOT RIDICULOUS. YOU KNOW MITCH MUSTAIN HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF COMING ON RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME MESSAGE BOARDS GOT BIG IN ARKANSAS. HE HIMSELF, SIGNED ON TO THIS BOARD. AND HE WOULD GET IN ARGUMENTS WITH PEOPLE ABOUT HIMSELF. SOME GUY COMES ON THERE AND SAYS, "I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT MITCH IS GOING TO NOTRE DAME." AND THEN MITCH WOULD GET ON THERE WITH THIS FAKE NAME, AND SAY, "I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT MITCH MUSTAIN HASN'T DECIDED WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO." THIS IS A KID THAT TOOK MY PHONE NUMBER AND PUT IT ON FACEBOOK AS HIS PHONE NUMBER. AND I WAS GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, "COME TO ARKANSAS! MITCH, YOU'RE THE BEST!" THIS IS ON MY PHONE. AND HE'S JUST PLAYING A PRANK ON ME. "WHAT'S THIS KID DOING?" BUT THAT'S MITCHELL. OKAY, I MEAN, THAT'S JUST MITCH. AND THERE WERE ALL THESE RUMORS FLYING ABOUT, WHAT'S HE GONNA DO? HE'S NOW MAD AT ARKANSAS. THIS KID'S CRAZY. AND WE JUST DECIDED TO SEE IF HE WOULD COME ON OUR RADIO SHOW AND TRY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS. HE DID A MARVELOUS JOB OF DOING THIS TWO-HOUR INTERVIEW AND NOT GIVING US ANY HINT ABOUT WHERE HE WAS GONNA GO TO SCHOOL. BUT WHILE HE WAS DOING THIS I NOTICED THERE WAS A LITTLE 3X5 CARD, AND IT HAD AN ARKANSAS SCHEDULE ON IT. SCHEDULE OF GAMES FOR THAT YEAR. AND HE TOOK ONE OF THESE 3X5 CARDS AND HE BEGAN FOLDING THIS CARD. FOLDING IT, AND FOLDING IT, AND FOLDING IT. AND THEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIRST HOUR. I SAW HIM TEARING THIS CARD INTO LITTLE PIECES. AND THEY WERE ALL THE SAME SIZE. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU JUST SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF FINDING OUT WHAT A PERSON'S REALLY LIKE. [NARRATOR] IF MITCHELL HAD DOUBTS, IT WAS UP TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS TO ERASE THEM. IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR NUTT TO KEEP MUSTAIN IN STATE. WHETHER OR NOT HE BELIEVED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE A FIRST TEAM ALL AMERICAN QUARTERBACK OR NOT. BUT HE NEEDED TO MAKE A CHARGE AT THEM. HE NEEDED TO GET MITCH. THAT'S JUST THE BOTTOM LINE. THE '04 AND '05 SEASONS, HIS JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR, ARKANSAS FOOTBALL WAS HORRIBLE. BACK TO BACK LOSING SEASONS UNDER HOUSTON NUTT. NOW PEOPLE ARE WATCHING, EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN HIGH SCHOOL, THIS MALZAHN GUY AND THESE FLASHY PLAYERS THAT ARE REALLY TALENTED DOING REALLY ENTERTAINING THINGS, THAT OH BY THE WAY, YOU CAN WIN WITH. AND SO WITH IT BEING SO CLOSE TO ARKANSAS, THE FAYETTEVILLE CAMPUS YOU KNOW, YOU JUST START HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. WITH BOOSTERS, AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE INFLUENCE IN THE PROGRAM. AND GRADUATES AND OF COURSE HERE COMES THE BIG ARGUMENT: CAN A HIGH SCHOOL COACH IN MALZAHN REALLY HELP THIS TEAM? I THINK EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL IS YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHETHER A HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM IS GOING TO WORK AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. IN PARTICULAR THE S.E.C. PEOPLE SAW HOPE IN THAT SPRINGDALE FIVE FOR SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T HAVE. WHICH WAS A PASSING ATTACK TO GO ALONG WITH THESE GREAT RUNNING BACKS. YOU KNOW ARKANSAS CAN RUN FOR A BILLION YARDS IN A GAME, BUT THEY COULDN'T PICK UP A BIG THIRD DOWN WHEN THEY HAD TO HAVE IT. THE COMBINATION OF THE RAZORBACKS NOT BEING VERY GOOD, THE OFFENSE BEING PRETTY CONSERVATIVE, AND THIS REALLY ATTRACTIVE THING THAT MET THE NEEDS OF THOSE FIRST TWO I MENTIONED. RIGHT UP HERE AT SPRINGDALE NOT FAR FROM THE ARKANSAS CAMPUS. SEEMED LIKE, IT JUST HAD TO HAPPEN. ON THE SURFACE IT SEEMED LIKE A GREAT IDEA. I MEAN, HERE IS THIS GUY WHO OBVIOUSLY IS ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF OFFENSIVE FOOTBALL. ARKANSAS NEEDS TO IMPROVE ITS OFFENSE. IT NEEDS A QUARTERBACK. WHY NOT BRING HIM AND HIS EXPLOSIVE WIDE RECEIVER FRIEND, AND HIS STAND OUT TIGHT END ALONG WITH HIM. [NARRATOR] SO SOME FOLKS GOT TOGETHER -[CELL PHONE BUZZING] -AND CAME UP WITH A PLAN. IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO I REMEMBER ANSWERING THE PHONE AND I SAID, "YES, SIR, WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND HE SAID, "WELL, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I TOOK THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR JOB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS." SOME BOOSTERS GOT TOGETHER, DECIDED, "HEY, WE'LL BRING GUS MALZAHN IN. HOUSTON IS A GREAT HEAD COACH BUT HE'S A BAD PLAY CALLER. WE'LL SOLVE THIS ONE PROBLEM BY BRINGING THIS TREMENDOUS PLAY CALLER IN. WITH HIS GREAT OFFENSE, AND WE'LL GET ALL THESE PLAYERS. WELL I MEAN, THERE WAS GREAT PRESSURE ON HOUSTON TO, YOU KNOW-- WHO DELIVERED, WHO MADE MALZAHN HAPPEN? WAS IT A BOOSTER? WHO MADE-- WAS IT LINDSEY? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYBODY THAT CARES MORE ABOUT THE RAZORBACKS THAN JIM LINDSEY. JIM LINDSEY STARTED ARKANSAS, PLAYED IN THE NFL, CAME BACK TO ARKANSAS. I MEAN HE HAS REALLY STARTED FROM THE GROUND UP AND BUILT AN EMPIRE. JIM LINDSEY IS ALSO A PRETTY HUMBLE GUY THAT HAS GIVEN A LOT OF MONEY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS, PLAYED FOR FRANK BROYLES AND THERE WAS A-- YOU KNOW THERE'S A TIGHTNESS OF FRIENDSHIP THERE. THAT WAS PROBABLY TESTED IN THIS WHOLE TIME. BECAUSE RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE, IS ONE OF JIM LINDSEY'S BEST FRIENDS, GARY GEORGE. WHO IS AT THE HEART OF SPRINGDALE. AND THEY HAVE A POULTRY COMPANY. THERE WAS A INTERESTING TRIANGLE BETWEEN SPRINGDALE'S GARY GEORGE, JIM LINDSEY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, AND FRANK BROYLES AND THE ARKANSAS RAZORBACKS. AND I'M SURE THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE MANY CONVERSATIONS. SO WHEN YOU HAVE THIS INTIMATE OF A SITUATION, IT BECOMES REALLY PERSONAL. AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A PRETTY MUCH REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE OF THAT CLASSIC LINE FROM "COOL HAND LUKE," "WHAT WE HAVE IS A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE." NOBODY COMMUNICATED. THE THING IS, THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WHO TOLD WHAT TO WHOM. SOMEONE WITHIN THE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT, HIGHER UP THAN HOUSTON, MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE HAD TO HIRE GUS MALZAHN. AND TO OFFER HIM WHATEVER IT TOOK. THEY NEEDED TO GET GUS, AND THEY NEEDED TO GET MITCH, AND THEY NEEDED TO GET DAMIAN AND THEY HAD TO GET THESE SPRINGDALE KIDS TO COME. KNOWING WHAT I KNOW, IT SURE WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WASN'T A BAD MARRIAGE FROM THE GET-GO. THE CONTRASTING STYLES WERE AN INDICATOR FROM THE WORD "GO." EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS HOUSTON NUTT, HE'S A RUN FIRST GUY. BALL POSITION, PLAY GOOD DEFENSE. AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS MALZAHN, KNOWS THAT HE'S A SPREAD THEM OUT, SLING AROUND THE FIELD AND SCORE 50. YOU RELATE THAT TO THE KIND OF THE WAY THAT IT HAPPENED, I THINK ALL OF THOSE KIDS WERE GOING ELSEWHERE. YOU KNOW, HERE I AM, I'M COMMITTED TO FLORIDA. DAMIAN IS COMMITTED TO FLORIDA. WHAT DOES FLORIDA DO? THEY THROW IT ALL OVER THE FIELD. BARTLEY'S COMMITTED TO NORTE DAME. MITCH WANTED TO GO TO NOTRE DAME AND HE WAS GONNA GO WITH BARTLEY. WHAT DID NOTRE DAME DO? THEY THREW IT ALL OVER THE FIELD. SO WHY WOULD WE WANT TO COME TO AN OFFENSE WHERE THEY HAND THE BALL OFF 50 TIMES A GAME? WELL ARKANSAS BECOMES SOMETHING OTHER THAN A RUN-FIRST TEAM, IF THEY HAVE A QUARTERBACK LIKE MITCH MUSTAIN. YEAH, ONCE MALZAHN GOT ON BOARD AND THAT WHOLE DEAL PICKED UP, THERE WAS THE SPECULATION FOLLOWING THE END OF OUR SENIOR YEAR. BUT LIKE I SAID, "I MADE MY DECISION, I'M GONNA MOVE ON AND GO LOOK AT MY OPTIONS AGAIN. YOU GUYS FIGURE IT OUT AND WE'LL TALK WHEN YOU DO." AND THERE WAS A PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS RIGHT AFTER THAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT GUS WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO BRING HIM. AND THEN MOST OF US WERE GOING, "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? YOU HIRED THIS GUY IN PART TO BRING THIS QUARTERBACK HERE." WHAT IF HE DOESN'T COME? WHAT DO YOU DO NOW? I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN WE ALL KIND OF MADE THAT DECISION, WE'RE ALL GONNA GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS. I TOLD YOU, I HAVE BAD MEMORY WITH THIS SHIT, I WIPE IT OUT. HE IS MITCH MUSTAIN, HE JOINS US NOW ON "THE U" AND I'M GONNA IGNORE THE FACT THAT YOUR NAME IS AWESOME, AND JUST MOVE ON. INITIALLY, MITCH, YOU COMMITTED TO ARKANSAS. THEN YOU WANTED TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS. THEN RECOMMITTED TO ARKANSAS. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR FIRST COMMITMENT TO THIS FINAL ONE? WELL, THE FIRST TIME I COMMITTED, THEY HAD AS THEIR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR ROY WITTKE WHO IS NOW AT ARIZONA STATE. HE GOT FIRED. I DECIDED TO OPEN UP AT THAT TIME LOOK AROUND A LITTLE BIT, AND REALLY MAKE SURE I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. AND THEY MADE SOME HIRES AT ARKANSAS AND PUT TOGETHER A STAFF THAT I FELT REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH. IT WAS GUS MALZAHN AND ALEX WOOD COMING IN. [HOST] WELL, FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, GUS MALZAHN IS YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COACH OVER AT SPRINGDALE. HE WAS NAMED ARKANSAS' OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT TO YOUR DECISION? THAT WAS A KEY FACTOR AS FAR AS BEING COMFORTABLE BUT IT WASN'T THE DECIDING FACTOR. LIKE MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. AN ICONIC HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH, WHO HAD NEVER COACHED IN COLLEGE BEFORE, WAS LANDING A PROMINENT POSITION. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE BEST PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY, WHO HE COACHED IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND ALL HIS FRIENDS, WERE LINING UP TO JOIN THE RAZORBACKS PARTY. THE NUMBER ONE QUARTERBACK RECRUIT IN THE NATION, MITCH MUSTAIN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND GOOD LUCK OVER AT ARKANSAS. THANKS FOR HAVING ME, GUYS. HE'S STAYING IN STATE, HE'S STAYING WITH MANY OF HIS TEAMMATES. HE'S STAYING WITH HIS HIGH SCHOOL COACH. WELL HOUSTON NUTT-- BEST RECRUIT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE HIGH SCHOOL COACH. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU GET THE QUARTERBACK AND YOU GET THREE OTHER PLAYERS. THERE SHOULD BE NO APOLOGIES FOR THE FACT THAT IT WAS A PACKAGE DEAL. THE NCAA DIDN'T CONSIDER IT TO BE A VIOLATION SO WHY SHOULD THEY? I THINK ADMITTEDLY IT WAS A BIT STRANGE FOR ALL OF US. THE PHILOSOPHIES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. SEEING WHAT I'VE SEEN OF HOUSTON, AND HIS GUYS AND THE WAY THEY OPERATED. WE'RE PREPARING TOGETHER, AND IT'S JUST BEEN GOOD. IT'S BEEN A GREAT FIT. SEEING THOSE TWO PHILOSOPHIES COME TOGETHER, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE IF OBAMA HIRED PRESIDENT BUSH TO BE HIS ADVISOR. IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY FIT. I THINK I WOULD BE LYING TO YOU IF I TOLD YOU AT THAT POINT, YOU CAN GO WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON? AND YOU REALLY HOPE AS A FAN AT THAT POINT, AND AS A FORMER PLAYER, AS ALUMNI, YOU HOPE IT WORKS OUT. WE HAD A LOT OF REASSURANCES FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF GUYS THAT HAVE A LOT OF PULL. THAT, "HEY WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE GET. WE GET TO MALZAHN'S TYPE STYLE." OUR HEAD COACH IS THERE, HE'S THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. YOU KNOW, WE CAN PLAY IN A SPREAD OFFENSE. LIKE WE WANTED TO. LOOKING BACK ON IT I MEAN, THERE WERE THINGS SAID THAT I KNEW AND I FELT THAT I KNEW, REALLY HONESTLY THAT THESE ASSURANCES COULDN'T BE KEPT. AND THEY COULDN'T BE MADE. IN ANY REAL SENSE, BUT ALL THE PIECES WERE PUT TOGETHER. EVERYBODY PUT ON THEIR FACE KIND OF TOLD US WHAT WE NEEDED TO HEAR. WHAT WE WANTED TO HEAR. AND SO WE THOUGHT, "OKAY, IT'S PERFECT." I REMEMBER WHEN I VISITED WITH THE SPRINGDALE FIVE AND GUS MALZAHN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FAYETTEVILLE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALL THE PLAYERS TOLD ME WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T JUST CONSIDER MALZAHN THEIR COACH, THEY CONSIDERED HIM A FATHER FIGURE. [SCHAD] THEY CONSIDERED HIM A SPIRITUAL LEADER. ONE AND OFF THE FIELD HE WAS A BIG INSPIRATION IN ALL OF OUR LIVES. SPIRITUALLY, HE LED A GOOD EXAMPLE. [SCHAD] THEY ATTENDED THE SAME CHURCH, THEY PORTRAYED THEMSELVES AS A GROUP WHO DIDN'T JUST STUDY FOOTBALL TOGETHER, THEY ALSO PRAYED TOGETHER. WHICH TO ME, WAS VERY TELLING. I THINK LOCKED IN THERE SOMEWHERE IS THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS DAD NOT BEING AROUND, AND DOESN'T HAVE THIS FATHER FIGURE. YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE MALZAHN WAS A FATHER FIGURE TO US. SO I THINK MITCH PUT A LOT OF TRUST INTO HIM. SOMEONE HE COULD TAKE ADVICE FROM, AND SEE WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO, SEE WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR HIM. WE WERE SET AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS. [MUSTAIN] WORKING ON AN OFFENSE THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH, WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET TO PLAY TOGETHER. AT A SCHOOL THAT WE'D ALL LIKE TO PLAY AT. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ONE BIG HOLDUP AND THAT WAS THE STAFF THAT WAS ALREADY THERE. THAT WAS THE ONLY HOLDUP WE HAD. OUR ONLY RESERVATION. THIS PACIFIED A LOT OF THAT, AND WE THOUGHT, "ALL RIGHT, WE CAN GET THIS DONE, WE CAN LIVE WITH THIS. AND WE MADE THE DECISION, WE COMMITTED." I MEAN, THE REST IS KIND OF HISTORY FROM THERE. IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW FOOTBALL, GETTING INVOLVED, INFLUENCING AN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, WHO THEN SAYS, "HEY, WE NEED TO DO THIS." HOUSTON NUTT DESERVES SOME BLAME IN THIS TOO, BECAUSE HE NEVER STOOD UP AND SAID, "I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS." WHAT'S SO AMAZING IS NOBODY REALLY BELIEVED IN THE SITUATION. NUTT DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS REALLY GONNA WORK. THE KIDS DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS GONNA WORK. THE PARENTS DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS GONNA WORK. IT'S LIKE THE WORST MOMENT IN LIFE IS WHEN WE KNOW WE SHOULDN'T DO SOMETHING, AND SOMEBODY CONVINCES US TO DO IT. AND WE GO, "I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. YOU TOLD ME TO DO THAT." MALZAHN HAD TO HAVE HIS DOUBTS COMING IN ABOUT REALLY CALLING HIS OWN OFFENSE. I MEAN, TALKING TO THE FAMILIES OF THE SPRINGDALE FIVE, LEADING UP TO THEM COMING TO ARKANSAS, THEY DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT HOUSTON NUTT WOULD EVER CHANGE. AND NUTT DIDN'T REALLY EVER WANT TO CHANGE. BUT HE HAD TO. I THINK WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HOUSTON NUTT'S MIND IS, "OUR PHILOSOPHIES, OUR THEORIES, OUR APPROACHES TO OFFENSE AREN'T THE SAME BUT I'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK. 'CAUSE IT'S WORTH IT." AND SO HE HAD TO DO SOME THINGS TO SAVE HIS JOB. MALZAHN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COACH FOR THE RAZORBACKS AND PROBABLY PART OF HIM FELT LIKE HE CAN KIND OF HELP THIS SITUATION TOO. BUT I THINK EVERYBODY WENT AGAINST THEIR OWN CONVICTIONS OF WHETHER THIS WAS REALLY GONNA WORK. AND THERE WAS JUST THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND SO IT DID. WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE. [NARRATOR] SO WITH A PLAN IN PLACE, MITCHELL AGAIN FOLLOWED HIS HEART. HE STAYED HOME. HE AND HIS TEAMMATES WOULD BE ARKANSAS RAZORBACKS. WE GRADUATED ON A SATURDAY, MOVED INTO THE DORM ON SUNDAY, AND STARTED CLASS ON MONDAY. AND SO THAT WAS HOW WE STARTED COLLEGE. I WISH I WAS LIVING IN ONE OF THE NICE FOOTBALL MOVIES, BUT I CAN'T REALLY HONESTLY SAY THAT I WAS, MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS WERE. AND GOOD FOR THEM. BUT MY FOCUS WAS ON THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT, OR LOOK LIKE A FOOL IF I GOT TO PLAY IN A GAME. [HOST] LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE START OF FALL CAMP AND THAT'S WHEN IT'S PUT UP OR SHUT UP TIME. THE HYPE, THE EXCITEMENT LEVEL IS RETURNED, DESPITE BACK-TO-BACK LOSING SEASONS. [SPORTSCASTER] DO YOU FEEL LIKE WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING, IT'S BEEN RE-ENERGIZED? [HOUSTON NUTT] I DO, I DO. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE BEING SAID RIGHT NOW. AND IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO, IT WASN'T TOO MANY GOOD THINGS BEING SAID. I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF HESITATION IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TALK RADIO SHOWS, OR THE NEWSPAPER OR ANYTHING AT THAT TIME. IT MADE IT SEEM LIKE ARKANSAS NEVER WON A FOOTBALL GAME. AND NOW THAT MALZAHN WAS COMING AND THEY GOT US GUYS TO COME, THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE S.E.C. AND THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT RUBS PEOPLE WRONG. IT'S PRETTY INSULTING, IF YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR 3, 4, 5 YEARS AT THIS POINT. YOU'RE WORKING YOUR BUTT OFF, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, EVERYBODY IS JUST FOCUSED ON THESE NEW GUYS THAT ARE 18 YEARS OLD. [ANNOUNCER] IT'S INTERESTING, WE HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE INCOMING CLASS, THEY HAVE KIND OF BEEN LOW KEY OVER THE SUMMER. HOW MUCH HAS IT HELPED THEM TO KIND OF BE OUT -[ANNOUNCER] OF THE SPOTLIGHT? -[NUTT] YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S GOOD. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU GUYS PROBABLY DON'T LIKE THAT, I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WE JUST DON'T PUT SO MUCH ATTENTION ON THOSE GUYS RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH. WE'VE GOT SOME MOMENTUM, AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT-- WE'VE HAD A VERY GOOD RECRUITING CLASS. AND THIS IS BIG STEP FOR THEM. FROM FRIDAY NIGHT TO SATURDAY NIGHT, BIG STEP. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE JUNIOR, SENIORS, THE OLDER CLASS. THE UPPER CLASS GUYS. THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE. WHO HAD PLAYED FOR A WHILE, PLAYED FOR A LONG TIME, CERTAINLY HAD THEIR LOYALTIES. OKAY, WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE ATTITUDES ARE WHAT THEY ARE, AND THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT WE CAN DO TO CHANGE THAT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY HIRED MALZAHN AS THEIR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. AND EVERYBODY ON THAT TEAM, TO THAT POINT HAD MADE THE DECISION THAT WAS BEST FOR THEM. UPPERCLASSMEN, UNDERCLASSMEN, DIDN'T MATTER, COACHES. THEY'RE ALL THERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE DECISION THEY MADE FOR WHATEVER REASON. WITH THE NEW GUYS COMING IN, AND TRY TO GET ORGANIZED AS FAR AS GIVING YOUR GUYS THE BEST CHANCE AT BEING SUCCESSFUL DURING THE GAME, YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY ORGANIZED IN PRACTICE. AND SO WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT. BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING TO THE FIELD AND PROVING IT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK AND ALL THAT AND THINGS LOOK GOOD AND ALL THAT, BUT WE'RE-- OUR PLAYERS AND COACHES ARE READY TO GET TO THE FIELD AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND THEN YOU THROW IN, TRYING TO GET READY FOR USC ALSO. [SPORTSCASTER] THE VERDICT'S IN AND ROBERT JOHNSON GOT THE NOD, WHEN OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR GUS MALZAHN TOLD THE TEAM AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE TEAM APPLAUDED AND HOUSTON NUTT ENDORSED. WE'RE GONNA NAME ROBERT JOHNSON OUR STARTING QUARTERBACK. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, ROBERT HAS IMPROVED AND WE WANT EVERYONE TO GET BEHIND HIM. SO JOHNSON IS GONNA TAKE THE FIRST SNAP AGAINST SOUTHERN CAL, SOMETHING HE'S EARNED IN THE OFF-SEASON. AND DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR, CLEARLY HE'S NOT THE FAN FAVORITE, AND HAD TO OVERCOME NOT ONLY LAST YEAR'S WOES BUT THE HYPE OF MITCH MUSTAIN. MITCH MUSTAIN IS AN EXCELLENT QUARTERBACK. AND FOR A FRESHMAN, HE'S DONE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. I AGREED WITH IT, TO BE HONEST. I THOUGHT HE WAS OUR BEST OPTION. THE YEAR BEFORE AT SC HAD BEEN A BLOWOUT. THEY'D LOST A LOT OF THEIR GUYS, REGGIE AND MATT WERE GONE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT THAT THIS MAY BE OUR CHANCE. I THINK. IN THE BACK OF OUR HEADS, WE ALL KNEW THAT SC, THEY JUST RELOAD. WE KNEW THAT WE HAD OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US. SO WE GET IN THE GAME. IT ENDS UP BEING A ROUTE, KIND OF DASHED OUR HOPES A LITTLE BIT. AND AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED, THE GAME WAS OVER. THAT WAS IT. BEFORE I KNOW IT, I GET THE CALL TO START WARMING UP. PROBABLY ABOUT AS NERVOUS AS I'D BEEN, AS I CAN EVER REMEMBER BEING. AT THIS POINT, I FORGET HOW MANY MINUTES ARE LEFT IN THE GAME. BUT I GET IN THE GAME. I DON'T REMEMBER EVEN WHAT PLAYS WE CALLED. IT JUST KIND OF WENT BACK TO HABIT. [ANNOUNCER] AND THERE IS THE FRESHMAN QUARTERBACK, THE PLAYER OF THE YEAR. GATORADE USA TODAY, JUST HAD REMARKABLE NUMBERS AT SPRINGDALE, ARKANSAS HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. AND THE CROWD WAS VERY WELCOMING. FOR THIS LOCAL HERO. I REMEMBER RUNNING, HAVE TO ROLL OUT MY LEFT AND LAWRENCE JACKSON KNOCKING ME DOWN. I MEAN, THAT WAS KIND OF AN EYE OPENER. [ANNOUNCER] AND HE COMPLETES HIS FIRST PASS. AND THEY ROAR LIKE HE JUST THREW A 70 YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS, RIGHT? WELL THIS IS WHAT HE'S USED TO DOING. THE HURRY-UP TWO-MINUTE TYPE OFFENSE THEY'RE IN THAT MODE COMPLETELY, RIGHT NOW. AND THIS IS WHAT HE DID EVERY GAME, ALL GAME AT SPRINGDALE LAST YEAR. AND THEN I THREW A LONG PASS AT DAMIAN, EVERYTHING JUST GOT SUPER CHARGED. I MEAN, THAT WAS ABOUT THE MOST ENERGY I'VE EVER FELT IN THAT GAME IN MY LIFE. [ANNOUNCER] MUSTAIN LOOKS VERY COMFORTABLE. THROWS A STRIKE TO WILLIAMS, HIS TEAMMATE IN HIGH SCHOOL LAST YEAR. AND A 42-YARD STRIKE. AND YOU ARE WITNESSING THE BEGINNING OF WHAT COULD BE THE MITCH MUSTAIN ERA AT ARKANSAS. [MUSTAIN] AND THEN RAN THE QUARTERBACK SNEAK IN THE END ZONE. REALLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. [ANNOUNCER] AND NOW THE QUARTERBACK WILL TAKE IT HIMSELF. WELL HOW IMPRESSIVE WAS THAT? [MUSTAIN] OBVIOUSLY, I DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME TO STOP AND SOAK IT ALL UP AND TAKE IT ALL IN FOR WHAT IT WAS, BUT... EVERY TIME SOMEONE ASKS ABOUT IT, OR THAT FILM POPS UP, IT KIND OF TAKES ME BACK A LITTLE BIT AND MAKES ME KIND OF WANT THAT TIME BACK. THERE'S ALWAYS THAT THOUGHT OF, IF I KNEW THEN, WHAT I KNOW NOW. [ANNOUNCER] AND HE LOOKED EXTRAORDINARILY AT EASE. [ANNOUNCER #2] WELL, THAT'S HIS SYSTEM. HE'S MORE COMFORTABLE IN THIS OFFENSE THAN ROBERT JOHNSON. [NARRATOR] AND WITH THAT, MITCH MUSTAIN WAS A HERO. THE HERO WE HAD HOPED FOR. THE FIRST GAME AGAINST USC, WAS A DEAL BREAKER, FOR HOUSTON. I THINK THAT GAME WAS ONE WHERE YOU GET EMBARRASSED AT HOME, NEW SYSTEM. ALL THE GREAT PLAYERS. IS THIS ALL REALLY WORTH IT? BREAKING NEWS, WE'RE GONNA GO RIGHT TO HOUSTON NUTT. IN A LATE AFTERNOON PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE ANNOUNCED THAT FRESHMAN MITCH MUSTAIN WILL NOW BE THE STARTING QUARTERBACK. WE'RE GONNA GO WITH MITCH RIGHT NOW, GET HIM READY. AND CASEY WILL BE RIGHT THERE BEHIND HIM. CASEY WILL BE RIGHT THERE BEHIND HIM. AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME, I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO MAKE THIS MOVE. [NARRATOR] HE WAS NOW A PUBLIC FIGURE. WHETHER HE ASKED FOR IT, OR NOT. [STOERNER] WHEN YOU'RE THE RUNNING BACK, QUARTERBACK, IT'S AS BIG AS ANY POLITICAL POSITION OUT THERE, AS ANY CEO OUT THERE. THAT'S WHEN IT KIND OF SOAKS IN TO REALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND WHAT YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF. AND THE MAGNITUDE OF IT ALL. THERE'S NO BETTER POSITION, AND THERE'S NO WORSE POSITION. AND THE PROBLEM IS FOR A YOUNG MAN, PEOPLE COMPARE YOU TO THE GOVERNOR OR THE HEAD COACH TO THE GOVERNOR. WELL THOSE TWO GUYS ARE ADULTS, YOU'RE NOT. EVEN SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED POLITICIANS OR POWERFUL GUYS IN THE COUNTRY, CAN'T HANDLE THAT. AND THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF HANDLERS AROUND THEM, TRYING TO CLEAN IT UP. BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FRESHMAN, DEALING WITH ALL OF THE STUFF. THE UPS AND DOWNS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE THE MOST POPULAR PERSON IN YOUR STATE. IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. I MEAN, IT REALLY IS. IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD. AND THE BAD WITH THE GOOD. THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S WHAT MAKES A PLAY SPECIAL. BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, IT CAN BURY YOU AS WELL. [MUSTAIN] EVERYTHING FROM THAT POINT ON JUST GOT ACCELERATED. I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET THE START IN THE NEXT WEEK. IT'S ONE THING TO GO IN FOR TWO DRIVES AGAINST USC AND SCORE A TOUCHDOWN, THAT'S FINE. BUT FROM THAT POINT ON, IT JUST BECAME A BLUR. AND WEEK AFTER WEEK WENT BY. REALLY JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY HEAD ABOVE THE WATER. [IRWIN] FROM THAT POINT ON, IT WAS JUST A MESS. ONCE THAT SEASON STARTED AND IN PARTICULAR ONCE MITCH MUSTAIN STARTED THE SECOND GAME OF THE YEAR, TWO FACTIONS OF SUPPORTERS STARTED GOING AT EACH OTHER. PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED HOUSTON NUTT, AND PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED GUS MALZAHN. THERE WAS RESENTMENT IN THAT LOCKER ROOM TOWARD MALZAHN AND HIS BOYS. AS THEY WERE REFERRED TO. YOU HAVE A FRESHMAN CLASS-- A VERY HERALDED FRESHMAN CLASS. ON MAGAZINE COVERS, TALKED ABOUT ON RADIO AND THEN YOU HAVE A GROUP OF GUYS THERE WHO ARE VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO HOUSTON NUTT. VERY TALENTED GROUP OF GUYS. OKAY, I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DARREN MCFADDEN, FELIX JONES. GUYS WHO WENT ON TO PLAY IN THE NFL. I MEAN, YOU HAD A REALLY TALENTED TEAM. THERE WAS RESENTMENT THERE. THERE WAS DEFINITELY A SPLIT. THE TENSION WAS REAL. I MEAN, YOU COULD FEEL IT. I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MANIFESTED ITSELF UNTIL LATER ON IN THE SEASON. WE SAW SOME GLIMPSES OF WHAT MUSTAIN COULD DO. I'M THINKING OF THE VANDERBILT GAME. IN NASHVILLE, HE KIND OF PUMPS THE SAFETY OFF, THROWS IT OVER THE TOP. PRETTY SURE IT WAS TO MONK. [ANNOUNCER] THIS WILL BE A TOUCHDOWN FOR THE HALLS, MARCUS MONK. I MEAN, YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND THAT, WE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND SO ANYTHING MITCH DID IN TERMS OF THROWING THE FOOTBALL WELL, WAS A BIG DEAL FOR RAZORBACK FANS. [ANNOUNCER] SIDE ARM SWINGING, PASSED. IT'S MARCUS MONK. THERE WAS JUST A GAP FROM CLINT STOERNER'S SUCCESS AS A QUARTERBACK TO THE YEAR MITCH MUSTAIN GOT HERE. AFTER CLINT HAD LEFT THERE WASN'T A QUARTERBACK THAT HAD COME THROUGH THAT HAD SHOWN HE COULD OWN A GAME. SO FOR MOST OF HOUSTON NUTT'S TENURE, IT WAS A COMBINATION OF QUARTERBACKS NOT BEING VERY GOOD, OR SUPREMELY GIFTED ATHLETICALLY LIKE MATT JONES. MATT JONES CERTAINLY DID HIS PART, BUT HE DID IT IN THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT A FREAK ATHLETE TO DO. AND I, I DON'T HAVE THOSE TALENTS. SO WHEN MUSTAIN GOT HERE. IT WAS FINALLY BACK TO A QUARTERBACK THAT COULD THROW THE FOOTBALL, THAT'S HOW PEOPLE FELT. [ANNOUNCER] MUSTAIN OVER THE MIDDLE! TOUCHDOWN ARKANSAS! BEN CLEVELAND WHO HE CONNECTED WITH THROUGHOUT HIS HIGH SCHOOL CAREER. THEY WILL GO HOME NEXT WEEK TO MEET THE CRIMSON TIDE. THAT WAS A GAME IN WHICH MITCH THREW FOUR, FIVE INTERCEPTIONS. HE WASN'T VERY GOOD. ALABAMA COULD'VE WON THE GAME. THEY MISSED A FIELD GOAL TO WIN IT. WENT INTO OVERTIME. ONE PLAY LEFT, AND THAT'S THE PLAY WHERE HE THREW THE BALL BETWEEN TWO DEFENDERS TO BEN CLEVELAND AND WON THE GAME WITH THAT TOUCH DOWN PASS. AND IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN IT, IT HAD TO BE PERFECT. [ANNOUNCER] RUSH THREE, AND DROP EIGHT. IN THE CORNER. TOUCHDOWN! [CROWD CHEERING] TOUCHDOWN ARKANSAS! MUSTAIN IS 3-0 AS A STARTER. BUT YOU KNOW, IT WAS INTERESTING, MITCH NEVER GOT CREDIT FOR THAT. HE WAS THREE OF SIX WITH THREE INTERCEPTIONS UNTIL THAT LAST TD PASS. BY THAT POINT THIS WHOLE THING WAS SO CONTROVERSIAL, PEOPLE HAD PICKED SIDES. YOU'RE EITHER ON GUS'S SIDE OR ON HOUSTON NUTT'S SIDE. YOU EITHER LIKED MITCH MUSTAIN, OR YOU DON'T LIKE HIM. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIM, HE DIDN'T WIN THAT GAME WITH THAT PASS. DIDN'T HAPPEN. [SCHAD] THE GAME IS OVER, THE FIELD IS CLEAR. THE STADIUM IS EMPTY. AND I GET A PHONE CALL FROM MY PRODUCER. MY PRODUCER SAYS, "WHO CAN YOU GET FOR US? WE'RE LIVE ON THE AIR. WE WANT A GUEST". I SAID, "HOW ABOUT MITCH MUSTAIN?" SO I GIVE MITCH THE PHONE AND I'M SORT OF STANDING THERE WATCHING THIS WITH GUS MALZAHN OFF TO THE SIDE WITH HIS WIFE. THEY'RE ALL BEAMING. AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, "THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY MITCH MUSTAIN ESPN INTERVIEWS." AND I'M THINKING NOW THAT WAS PROBABLY MITCH MUSTAIN'S LAST ESPN INTERVIEW, SO... YOU'VE GOT A STARTER, THEY'RE WINNING GAMES. MAYBE HE DOESN'T LOOK GREAT EVERY WEEK BUT HE DOES HAVE HIS MOMENTS. HE GOES ON THE ROAD AT AUBURN, AND AUBURN WAS RANKED I THINK IN THE TOP FIVE AT THAT TIME. AND YET HE JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT PEOPLE WERE ACCEPTING THIS GUY. AND WHAT HE WAS DOING. [ANNOUNCER] THAT BALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED! I KNEW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW FRESHMEN DON'T USUALLY DO THAT. MATTHEW STAFFORD WAS STARTING AT GEORGIA AND HE WAS STRUGGLING TOO. I KNEW WE HAD THE SUPPORTING CAST WITH MCFADDEN, FELIX, PEYTON, MARCUS MONK, ALL OUR GUYS ON OFFENSE. I KNEW THAT I HAD ENOUGH TALENT AROUND ME TO REALLY PROP ME UP AND HELP ME IN THAT ASPECT. BUT PERSONALLY, IT WAS A REAL STRUGGLE. WHEN I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU GET SOME PRETTY GOOD TALENT AROUND HIM AND THE FURTHER THE YEAR WENT ON, I THINK THE BETTER MITCH GOT. BUT NOW WE'RE GETTING MORE INTO GUS'S OFFENSE, WE'RE GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM WHAT COACH NUTT BELIEVES IN AS THE YEAR GOES ON. FROM A MITCH MUSTAIN DEVELOPMENT STAND POINT, I JUST DON'T THINK HE EVER GOT A CHANCE TO DEVELOP. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT MITCH HAD IN HIS DEVELOPMENT OR ANY QUARTERBACK UNDER HOUSTON NUTT, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS WAS THE LACK OF REPS THEY GOT THROWING THE FOOTBALL IN PRACTICE I CAN REMEMBER GOING TO LOS ANGELES AND WATCHING ARKANSAS AND SOUTHERN CAL IN WARM UPS. AND HOW MANY REPS THAT MATT LEINART AND THOSE GUYS GOT BEFORE THE GAME IN 7 ON 7 PASSING DRILLS, WERE MORE THAN ARKANSAS HAD IN PRACTICE ALL WEEK. [MUSTAIN] HERE IT WAS LIKE, "WHOA, LET'S SAVE YOUR ARM." WHICH IS FANTASTIC IF YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD. IT'S GONNA BE MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AS MANY REPS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S THERE TO DEVELOP YOU AND TO SAY, "OKAY, HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE MAKING MISTAKES." AND ALL OF THAT BASED AROUND A CORE. OF CORE PHILOSOPHY, "HERE'S WHAT WE DO." "HERE'S HOW WE DO IT." AND WITHIN THAT, YOU CAN DEVELOP YOUR QUARTERBACKS. AND SO HIS DEVELOPMENT, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GIVEN A CHANCE. FROM THE OUTSIDE, I THINK WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED BECAUSE WE WERE ON THE INSIDE OF IT. AND WE SAW KIND OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. FROM THE OUTSIDE IT WAS, "OKAY, GUS IS HERE NOW. AND IT'S HIS OFFENSE. HE'S THE COORDINATOR. SO OBVIOUSLY, WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IS HIS STUFF. CONSTANTLY AS WE WIN, IT'S OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE WINNING BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING GUS'S DEAL. AND GUS'S DEAL IS GREAT. AND IT'S DOING THIS. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IT'S PUTTING UP. LOOK WHO IT'S BEATING. WE BEAT AUBURN AT AUBURN WHEN THEY WERE RANKED NUMBER TWO." AND HOUSTON NUTT ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT NOT CARING WHO GOT THE CREDIT. HE WOULD TEACH THAT. BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THERE ALWAYS HAD TO BE A SCORE ON WHO GETS THE CREDIT. YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY RUNNING GUS'S STUFF, SOME OF THIS IS THE OLD STUFF, WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING THE CREDIT FOR IT? AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I THINK HOUSTON NUTT IS A PRETTY GOOD GUY, BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING DEVALUED, WELL, WHAT'S NUTT GONNA DO? DEFENSIVE. THIS IS A HIGH SCHOOL COACH AND MAYBE I'M KIND OF TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT HOW SMART HE IS, BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT HOUSTON NUTT WAS AN OFFENSIVE MIND, HIMSELF. [STOERNER] COACH NUTT HAD GREAT ASSISTANT COACHES, THAT'S WHERE HE THRIVED WAS WHEN HE HAD ASSISTANT COACHES AROUND HIM. NOT GUYS THAT WERE COMING UP THAT WERE GONNA GO AND MOVE ON TO BE HEAD COACHES. I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY OBVIOUS FROM THE GET-GO THAT GUS WAS GONNA END UP BEING A BIG TIME COORDINATOR AND POTENTIALLY A HEAD COACH. AND, UH, MAYBE THAT WAS A LITTLE THREATENING, I DON'T KNOW. IF MITCH SUCCEEDED, GUS SUCCEEDED. AND I THINK HOUSTON NUTT HAD A PLAN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO EITHER NEUTRALIZE HIM-- GET HIM AWAY FROM THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR'S POSITION, OR GET HIM TO LEAVE ENTIRELY AND I THINK HE HAD THAT PLAN BECAUSE HE FELT THREATENED. YEAH, I THINK THERE WAS CERTAINLY A LOT OF RESENTMENT, A LOT OF ILL WILL BETWEEN THE PARTIES AT THAT POINT. AND IT ONLY COMPOUNDED, I THINK, IN LATE IN OCTOBER ABOUT THE TIME SOUTH CAROLINA CAME UP THAT THE BOOK CAME OUT. THAT KURT VOIGT WROTE ABOUT THE SPRINGDALE TEAM. COMMENTS THAT I HAD MADE, COMMENTS I DON'T REGRET. COMMENTS I THINK WERE SPOT ON. [VOIGT] HE CALLED HIM A DORK. HE WAS FRUSTRATED. AND SO WE ACTUALLY TALKED, HOW CAN HE HANDLE THIS THE BEST? AND KIND OF THE IDEA THAT WE CAME UP WITH WAS, BEAT HIM TO THE POINT, YOU KNOW, GO AND APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. [MUSTAIN] GO TO HIM, EXPLAIN MYSELF SO THAT WE CAN MOVE PAST THAT. AND SO WE CAN GET ON WITH THAT AND THAT WAS IN OCTOBER. SAID, "HEY, I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I SAID THESE THINGS, I'M SORRY. I WAS A KID." AND HOUSTON TOLD HIM, "NO PROBLEM. I UNDERSTAND IT, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL. WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE." THE FIRST TIME HOUSTON WAS ASKED ABOUT IT ON CAMERA, A MOMENT WHEN HE COULD'VE ENDED EVERYTHING, HE COULD'VE JUST SAID, "MITCH CAME TO ME TWO WEEKS AGO AND APOLOGIZED AND IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE." HE DIDN'T. IT'S EASY TO SEE THE GUYS WHY UNDER TWO WEEKS THERE PRIOR TO SOUTH CAROLINA, WHY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DIGRESSION. HE HAD A LOT ON HIM. HE HAD A LOT ON HIM. IT WAS A BOOK. IT WAS A BOOK HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT IT. WHEN HE DID THAT, WHEN HE HUNG HIM OUT TO DRY LIKE THAT. IT JUST OPENED THE FLOOD GATES FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HARBORED RESENTMENT TOWARD MITCH, TOWARD GUS, TOWARD THIS GROUP. BY THIS POINT WE WERE A WEEK BEFORE THE SOUTH CAROLINA GAME. I REMEMBER SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WERE DOING A WALK THROUGH AND THEY HAD SOME DIFFERENT SCHEMES AS FAR AS BLITZING. AND MITCH WASN'T ABLE TO PICK UP THIS CERTAIN READ. AND COACH KEPT GETTING FRUSTRATED WITH HIM. AND NEXT THING I KNOW, HE SAYS, "CASEY COME HERE. I NEED YOU TO PICK UP THIS CHECK RIGHT HERE. YOU KNOW THIS CHECK?" "YES SIR, I DO." AND CASEY COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LATER, I SAID, "WHAT DID COACH NUTT SAY? IT WAS THE THURSDAY BEFORE THE SOUTH CAROLINA GAME. BEN GOT-- WE WERE IN THE STAIRWELL, HE STOPPED ME AND SAID, "HEY, CASEY TOLD ME THAT COACH NUTT APPROACHED HIM AT PRACTICE AND SAID, 'THE FIRST MISTAKE HE MAKES, FIRST PICK HE THROWS, YOU'RE GOING IN.'" EVEN IF IT WOULD'VE NEVER GOT BACK TO MITCH, THERE'S NOT A MORE DIFFICULT THING TO DO THAN TO PLAY THE QUARTERBACK POSITION WHEN YOU KNOW THERE'S DOUBT IN THE GUY THAT'S MAKING THE DECISION OF WHETHER YOU PLAY OR NOT. AT THAT POINT IT WAS DAMNED IF I DO, DAMNED IF I DON'T. I MEAN, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT AT SOME POINT I WAS GONNA THROW ANOTHER INTERCEPTION, AT SOME POINT I WAS GONNA MAKE A MISTAKE. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN ONCE YOU DECIDE TO GO WITH A GUY, I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO ALLOW THAT GUY TO PLAY HIS BEST. AND IN MY OPINION THAT'S NOT DOING THAT. [ANNOUNCER] THEY CAN NEUTRALIZE SOME OF THAT SIZE. WILLIAMS, FISH AND CRAWFORD, IS THREE WIDE RECEIVERS. AND MUSTAIN TO THROW. AND IT'S INTERCEPTED. PICKED UP BY CAPTAIN MUNNERLYN WELL, MITCH MUSTAIN, NOT THE START THAT HE WANTED. HE DID NOT PLAY VERY WELL LAST WEEK AGAINST LOUISIANA MONROE, THREW THREE INTERCEPTIONS. [MUSTAIN] YOU GET IN THERE THE GAME STARTS, AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE PLAY, I JUST REMEMBER JUST TO THE LEFT. AND I THREW IT. PICKED OFF. I GET YANKED. CASEY GOES IN. AND I REMEMBER STANDING ON THE SIDELINE AND BEN COMING OVER. [CLEVELAND] AND I SAID, "HEY, I TOLD YOU. ONE OF THOSE KIND OF DEALS." HE GOES, "YEAH, YOU WERE RIGHT." AFTER HE BENCHED ME, THAT'S FINE. I UNDERSTAND, I'M NOT PLAYING STELLAR. AND CASEY PLAYED FINE AFTER THAT. HE DID A GOOD JOB. THAT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT NOBODY SAID A WORD TO ME ABOUT IT. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ENCOURAGEMENT, ABOUT "KEEP YOUR HEAD UP." I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. I CARE ABOUT, LET'S FIX THE PROBLEM. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT IS BOTHERING YOU ENOUGH THAT WARRANTED PULLING ME. WELL, NOT A WORD WAS SAID TO ME. NOT BY HOUSTON, NOT BY GUS, NOT BY ANYBODY. IT LITERALLY SEEMED, IT WAS LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. IT WAS LIKE I'D NEVER SET FOOT IN THE BUILDING. WHEN MITCH THREW THAT PASS, AND HE WALKED OFF THE FIELD, YOU COULD JUST TELL THAT THIS WAS GONNA BE A BIG DEAL. [CLEVELAND] HERE'S MITCH, YOU KNOW, HE'S 8-0 AND TRUE FRESHMAN. YOU LIVE AND DIE WITH SOME OF THE THINGS BUT NOT COACH NUTT. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE SHINE OF MITCH STEALING THE SHOW FROM EVERYBODY. [STOERNER] WHEN YOU'VE GOT A FRESHMAN QUARTERBACK PLAYING, THERE'S GONNA BE MISTAKES MADE, THERE'S GONNA BE INTERCEPTIONS THROWN, THERE'S GONNA BE CHECKS MISSED, AND THAT'S PART OF IT. BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING AT YOUR FRESHMAN, "HE'S GROWING FROM EACH ONE OF THEM," WE SAY, "THAT'S OUR WEAKNESS. WE NEED TO REPLACE IT." AND I THINK THAT WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF EVERYTHING GOING ON OFF THE FIELD, NOT WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THE FIELD. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HOUSTON NUTT WAS LOOKING FOR A REASON TO BENCH MITCH MUSTAIN. BUT TO ME WHEN YOUR QUARTERBACK IS WINNING GAMES, HE DESERVED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO PLAY. IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE THAT MUSTAIN REALLY NEVER GOT BACK IN THE GAME AFTER HE WAS TAKEN OUT. THAT WAS THE BIZARRE PART. I HAD AN SEC COACH ASK ME, THAT OFF-SEASON, "WHY DIDN'T HOUSTON STICK WITH MITCH MUSTAIN?" A PROMINENT SEC COACH. AND I SAID, "I'M NOT SURE." AND THE COACH SAID, "WELL, I ASKED HOUSTON BEFORE THE GAME WHEN WE WERE TALKING." AND HE DIDN'T REALLY GET AN ANSWER. [NARRATOR] SO WHILE AN 8-0 WINNING STREAK SHOULD HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED, THE STATE BECAME DIVIDED. THE LOCKER ROOM BECAME DIVIDED. [MUSTAIN] IT REALLY WAS. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE PEOPLE WERE ATTRIBUTING HIS SUCCESS BECAUSE GUS CAME, AND BECAUSE WE CAME. HE'S CERTAINLY HAPPY WITH THE SUCCESS OVERALL, BUT NOT WITH WHAT, NOT WITH HOW IT WAS HAPPENING. AND I THINK THAT REALLY IRKED AT HIM. AND I-- I MEAN, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. IF, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WERE SAYING, "SEE? I MEAN, ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS BRING SOMEONE ELSE IN BESIDE YOURSELF, AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS." AND THEN, YEAH, I MEAN, YOU'D REALLY HAVE TO SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH AND THEN LEARN WHAT YOU CAN. AND I THINK THE GREAT ONES CAN DO THAT. HERE WE ARE AGAIN, WITH A TEAM THAT'S HAVING SOME SUCCESS, AND PROBABLY COULD'VE WON THE LSU GAME, OR COULD'VE PLAYED FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, IF THEY HAD A PASSING ATTACK. THERE WAS THE HOUSTON NUTT CAMP, AND THERE WAS THE GUS MALZAHN, MITCH MUSTAIN CAMP. [ANNOUNCER] DO YOU FEEL MISLEAD IN ANYWAY FROM BEING HIRED AND THINGS THAT WERE TOLD TO YOU BEING HIRED, TO TODAY? NO, YOU KNOW I'M SITTING HERE AND I'M OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS GOTTA-- IT'S A DREAM JOB FOR ME, IT'S A DREAM JOB FOR ME. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO HELP US WIN. TO AN EXTENT, YOU CAN'T BLAME HOUSTON NUTT. FOR DOING WHAT HE FELT HE HAD TO DO TO WIN GAMES. I MEAN, YOU HAVE DARREN MCFADDEN, PEYTON HILLIS, AND FELIX JONES. YOU NEED TO RUN THE FOOTBALL SUCCESSFULLY. BUT I DO BELIEVE, THAT IF THEY ALLOWED GUS TO RUN SOME MORE OF WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS. MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE WON THE SEC THAT YEAR? THEY DID WIN 10 GAMES. BUT EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THEY LOST THEIR LAST THREE. LSU, THE SEC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, AND THE BOWL GAME. [CLEVELAND] FOR OUR LOCKER ROOM TO BE SO DIVIDED, AND FOR US TO WIN SO MANY GAMES, THAT REALLY TELLS YOU HOW TALENTED OUR TEAM WAS. IF THESE TWO MEN HAD EVER SAT DOWN AND TALKED TO EACH OTHER, I THINK THEY WOULD'VE WON THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP THAT YEAR, I DO. BECAUSE THEY WON ALL THOSE GAMES WITH THIS TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL THING GOING ON. THEY HAD A QUARTERBACK THAT FELT LIKE HIS COACH DIDN'T LIKE HIM-- HE FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T BELONG ON THE TEAM. HE HAD TEAMMATES CALLING HIM OUT. HE HAD BOOSTER FRIENDS OF THE HEAD COACH SENDING HIM OBSCENE EMAILS. [SCHAD] I MEAN, MITCH MUSTAIN, THREW HIS SHARE OF INTERCEPTIONS, BUT TO BE CALLED OUT AS THE INTERCEPTION KING, WHICH I THINK ONE PERSON WROTE TO HIM, WAS JUST A JOKE. I MEAN THAT PERSON, WHOEVER IT IS, HE OR SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. I THINK WHERE IT EVENTUALLY TOOK HOUSTON NUTT DOWN, HE HAD A BOOSTER THAT WAS FRIENDS WITH HIS FAMILY. WHO WAS SO UPSET BY ALL THIS STUFF, AND SO CONVINCED THAT MITCH MUSTAIN WAS A PART OF THIS, HIS MOTHER WAS A PART OF IT. ALL THESE PEOPLE FROM SPRINGDALE WERE A PART OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE ATTACKING HER FRIEND, HOUSTON NUTT THE HEAD COACH. THAT SHE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO START WRITING EMAILS ABOUT THIS. AND TRYING TO WARN PEOPLE OF THE HORRIBLE DANGERS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE. THE FACT THAT MITCH MUSTAIN RECEIVED HATE EMAILS, TO ME WAS COMPLETELY UNCALLED FOR. IT BASICALLY DISPARAGES HIM, IT'S SOMEWHAT OBSCENE TO SEND THAT TO A COLLEGE KID IN HIS DORM ROOM. HE'S GONNA COME IN ONE DAY AND CHECK HIS EMAILS AND SEE THIS STUFF, FROM SOMEBODY HE DOESN'T KNOW, BUT SOMEBODY HE WILL EVENTUALLY FIND OUT IS NOT ONLY A BOOSTER, BUT A CLOSE FRIEND OF HOUSTON NUTT. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE REACTION WOULD BE? YOU HAVE ALL THIS DRAMA GOING ON, THEY STILL WON 10 GAMES. WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S NONE OF THAT? [ANNOUNCER] BIG NEWS, TONIGHT IN THE RAZORBACKS. WITH FRESHMAN WIDE RECEIVER, DAMIAN WILLIAMS LEAVING THE TEAM. NOW, THIS ALL STARTED WITH A PRIVATE MEETING LAST WEEK BETWEEN PARENTS OF FORMER SPRINGDALE PLAYERS AND ATHLETIC DIRECTOR FRANK BROYLES. THAT MEETING BECAME PUBLIC THIS WEEK AND CREATED A WHIRLWIND OF CONTROVERSY. THE PARENTS IN THAT MEETING WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE HOG FOOTBALL PROGRAM WAS HEADED AND IF THEIR SONS WOULD BE BETTER SUITED SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE DO HOWEVER HAVE SOME CLARITY ON THE SITUATION. HOUSTON NUTT, GUS MALZAHN, BEN CLEVELAND, MITCH MUSTAIN, ALL SAY THEY'RE HERE TO STAY AND ARE GETTING ALONG JUST FINE. I HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH MITCH, I HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH MITCH EARLIER IN THE WEEK. AND HE APOLOGIZED TO ME, HE WANTS TO BE HERE. HE WANTS TO BE A RAZORBACK. AND I ACCEPT THAT 100%. COACH NUTT ALSO SAID THAT THERE'S NO ANIMOSITY AT ALL BETWEEN HIM AND GUS MALZAHN. IN FACT HE SAID, "PLEASE ASK GUS MALZAHN ABOUT IT FOLLOWING PRACTICE." AS FAR AS ME AND HOUSTON I MEAN, HE HIRED ME. I CONSIDER HIM A FRIEND, AND WE'VE HAD A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP. GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP. I MEAN, I KNOW PEOPLE LOVE SEC FOOTBALL AND I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR FOOTBALL BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT DOWN ARE JUST ILLOGICAL AND WOULD BE HARD TO EXPLAIN TO ALMOST ANYBODY IN ANY OTHER STATE. [NARRATOR] ONLY IN ARKANSAS. WOO, PIG, SOOIE. THE DAY HE LEFT I TALKED TO MITCH. AND HIS EXACT QUOTE TO ME WAS, "WHO AM I GONNA TRUST NOW?" THEY HAD A RELATIONSHIP IN HIGH SCHOOL. THAT WAS FATHER-SON TYPE RELATIONSHIP. THEN I'M MAD AS HELL. [NARRATOR] WITH THE WRITING ON THE WALL, IT SEEMED CLEAR TO MITCHELL, THAT ARKANSAS WOULD NOT BE WHERE HE FINISHED HIS CAREER. [SCHAD] I REMEMBER REPORTING THAT MITCH WAS TRANSFERRING. I REMEMBER REPORTING THAT MITCH WAS TRANSFERRING TO USC. I REMEMBER REPORTING THAT GUS MALZAHN TOOK THE TULSA JOB. I KNEW MALZAHN WAS GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL WHEREVER HE WENT. AND I KNEW HE WAS GONNA DO WELL IN TULSA. BUT THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO, YOU KNOW, YOU BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE, IS REMAIN CLOSE TO THEM. AND I JUST REALLY WANTED TO GET OUT, AND I WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND DO SOMETHING ELSE. SO I KNEW THIS WAS MY OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT DONE, THAN TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND TO JUST LIVE A LIFE APART FROM IT. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MITCH MUSTAIN WOULD'VE PUT UP BIG NUMBERS IF HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS HIGH SCHOOL COACH ONE MORE TIME. HE DID IT FOR FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS BUT I DON'T THINK MITCH MUSTAIN HAD IT IN HIM TO GO PLAY FOOTBALL IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA. I KNEW THAT I'D HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM ARKANSAS AND NOT BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE I COULD DRIVE BACK AND FORTH ON THE WEEKENDS ON A BYE WEEK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WELL IT JUST SEEMED LIKE TO ME, THAT IT WAS A CHANCE FOR HIM TO START OVER, AND IT ALSO WAS A CHANCE TO GO TO THE BIGGEST BRAND IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL AT THE TIME. I THINK THE PROBLEM FOR HIM WAS, HE WENT TO THE WRONG SYSTEM. THERE WAS DEFINITELY A PART OF MITCH MUSTAIN THAT WANTED TO SHOW THAT HE COULD BE SUCCESSFUL RUNNING AN OFFENSE THAT WASN'T THE GUS MALZAHN OFFENSE. AND I THINK ALSO, MITCH WANTED TO SHOW THAT, YOU KNOW, HE HAD POTENTIAL AS A PRO QUARTERBACK-- AS A PRO STYLE QUARTERBACK. YOU KNOW, HAVING THE EXPERIENCE I'D HAD THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS-- SEVEN MONTHS, I'M THINKING, "OKAY, I'VE SEEN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD." I DON'T WANT TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER AVERAGE TEAM. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY JUST TO BE OUT THERE. I WANT TO PLAY AND I WANT TO GET BETTER, AND I KNEW I WAS GONNA HAVE TO FIND A-- THERE ARE VERY FEW PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT, AND USC WAS ONE OF THEM. AND TO BE HONEST, THAT WAS PRETTY WELL IT FOR ME. HE WANTED TO PLAY IN THE NFL. AND WHAT BETTER SCHOOL, AT THAT POINT, TO PREPARE TO PLAY QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL THAN UNDER PETE CARROL. AND IT PROBABLY WAS APPEALING, YOU KNOW, TO GO OUT TO HOLLYWOOD, I MEAN, GET AWAY FROM THE FISH BOWL, AND GO TO SOMETHING SO BIG, THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN GONNA MESS WITH YOU-- THEY'RE NOT EVEN GONNA BOTHER WITH YOU. [SCHAD] I MEAN, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MITCH MUSTAIN, YOU KNOW, FELT THAT HE FIT RIGHT INTO THAT L.A. LIFESTYLE. MUSIC, MOVIES, WEATHER, HOLLYWOOD, WOMEN. I MEAN, IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME, HERE'S THIS KID FROM ARKANSAS WHO SO EASILY SLIPPED INTO THE L.A. LIFESTYLE. WHILE IT WAS VERY APPEALING AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK, IT WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THE DRAMA FOLLOWING. IT'S SO NICE, MAN. I'M STAYING HERE. [CLEVELAND] I THINK MITCH WAS A LOST PERSON. YOU KNOW, HE GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE HIGH LIFE OF L.A. OVERALL, I'D CATEGORIZE IT AS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE. CERTAINLY FRUSTRATING A LOT OF TIMES. IT STARTS OFF WITH MY O.A. COMPETITION WITH MARK. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN MADE THAT WE WENT HEAD TO HEAD IN THAT. HE PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL. YOU KNOW, I HONESTLY COULDN'T SAY WITH ANY CERTAINTY THAT I WOULD'VE PLAYED ANY BETTER. AND THEN WE GO ON AND MATT COMES IN, EXTREMELY TALENTED, EXTREMELY MATURE FOR HIS AGE AT THE TIME. WHEN HE CAME IN, I MEAN, THERE IS NO DOUBT HE'D BEEN TRAINED VERY WELL. HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS EXPECTED AND WHAT HE WAS GONNA FACE AND SO. YOU KNOW, FROM THERE IT WAS PRETTY WELL SET I KNEW WHERE I WAS GONNA BE ON THAT. SO THAT PART WAS FRUSTRATING. AND THEN THERE WAS A LOT OF TIME IN BETWEEN THAT. YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH A LOT OF THINGS. THERE WAS A LONG PERIOD WHERE I REALLY WAS JUST OVER THE GAME. IT'S JUST HARD TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW, I WOULD MAKE CALLS OUT TO THE WEST COAST, YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S UP WITH MITCH MUSTAIN?" ALL THESE OTHER GUYS ARE HURT, HOW'S HE DOING WITH HIS REPS? AND THEN THEY WOULD SAID, "WELL, NOT MUCH." THEY'D SAY, YOU KNOW, "FOR SOME REASON, HE'S NEVER REALLY GRASPED THE OFFENSE. FAST ONE, GO AGAIN THERE, MITCH. [SCHAD] I MEAN, I REMEMBER SPEAKING TO LANE KIFFIN ABOUT THE QUARTERBACK COMPETITION. AND I REMEMBER LANE KIFFIN SAYING THAT MITCH WAS HAVING A HARD TIME GRASPING THINGS. AND IT DEFINITELY GOT THE FEELING THAT FOCUS WAS PART OF IT. [PLAYERS CHATTERING] KEEP THAT HIP OPEN SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. [CHATTERING CONTINUES] [SCHAD] THE WAY NFL TEAMS SCOUT COLLEGES NOW, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT EVEN WITH LIMITED REPETITIONS YOU WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO AT LEAST GET A WORK OUT FOR A NFL TEAM. BUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SAY, "OH, LOOK AT TOM BRADY." YOU KNOW, TOM BRADY AT LEAST HAD SOME VIDEO FOOTAGE. THERE'S HARDLY ANY VIDEO FOOTAGE OF MITCH MUSTAIN FROM USC. SO, YOU KNOW, TO THINK THAT HE WAS GONNA FOLLOW IN THE MATT CASSEL MODEL, YOU KNOW, TO ME, YOU KNOW, REALLY WASN'T VERY REALISTIC. PART OF THE USC THING WAS, YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN GO OUT THERE AND I CAN DO WHAT BRADY DID. I CAN BE A SEVENTH ROUND PICK BASED ON POTENTIAL. OR I CAN DO WHAT CASSEL'S DOING AND NOT BE DRAFTED. YOU KNOW, NOT PLAY AT ALL. ALSO THINK WHEN MITCH GOT OUT THERE, THERE WAS A PERSONALITY TRAIT THAT GOT ACCENTUATED OUT THERE. BUT IT WAS A PROBLEM HERE TOOL. TALKING TO HIS COACHES AND FROM USC COACHES, WAS THAT HIS TEMPERAMENT REALLY DIDN'T MESH WITH PETE CARROLL WHO WAS REAL BIG ON THE RAH RAH, AND HE WANTED A VERY VOCAL LEADER. HE'S NOT OUTGOING, HE'S NOT THE LIFE OF THE PARTY. HE DOESN'T BUDDY AROUND WITH HIS TEAMMATES. HE'S GOT A REALLY OFFBEAT PERSONALITY. HE LIKES A LOT OF THINGS THAT GUYS HIS AGE AREN'T TYPICALLY INTERESTED IN. HE'S INTERESTED IN MILITARY HISTORY. HE LIKES TO READ SPY NOVELS. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BLOGS OR MESSAGE BOARDS? MY FAVORITE ONE IS ONE CALLED NEPTUNUS LEX. REALLY FUCKING AWESOME WRITER. FOREIGN POLICY, OR DOMESTIC POLICY. OR WHATEVER. AND SO. AND I JUST DON'T THINK HE RELATED TO A LOT OF HIS TEAMMATES. YOU KNOW, MITCH MUSTAIN IS NOT A "TYPE A" PERSONALITY. YOU CAN OVERCOME THAT AS A QUARTERBACK, BUT IT A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE. I MEAN, I'M JUST NOT-- I'M REALLY QUIET, IT TAKES A WHILE TO WARM UP. AHEM, HOW NOW BROWN COW. AHEM, HOW NOW... AND SO I THINK THAT IN A SPORT WHERE EVERYTHING IS FIRST IMPRESSIONS A LOT OF IT'S HOW YOU COME OFF AND HOW YOU BOUNCE AROUND. PEOPLE LOVE THAT. THE MEDIA EATS IT UP. I MEAN, TO BE HONEST, I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT. EITHER YOU HAVE IT, AND THOSE GUYS BELIEVE IN YOU AND THEY BUY INTO YOU AND LISTEN TO YOU, AND LOOK IN YOUR EYES EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN A HUDDLE, AND BELIEVE AND TRUST WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO OR THEY DON'T. I THINK IT HURT HIM IN THAT ONE START THAT HE GOT AGAINST NOTRE DAME. I SAW THAT GAME, AND I'M NOT SAYING GUYS INTENTIONALLY SABOTAGED HIM. I JUST DON'T THINK THEY WERE INTO IT. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TOUCHDOWN PASS DROPPED AT THE END OF THAT GAME THAT WOULD HAVE WON IT. [ANNOUNCER] GOING DEEP. OUT THERE, OPEN AND IT DROPS. BY RONALD JOHNSON. THERE'S THE ONE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, TODD. AND THEY HAD IT. THAT'S ALL MITCH MUSTAIN CAN DO. HARRISON SMITH FALLS DOWN, THIS IS A TOUCHDOWN TO TAKE THE LEAD, AND RONALD JOHNSON JUST FORGETS ONE THING. - THAT BALL. - YEAH. OH, MAN. AND THAT HAS TO BE THE FIFTH DROPPED BALL ON A WELL-THROWN PASS BY MITCH MUSTAIN TONIGHT. ONE OF THE USC'S SENIORS KNOWS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HIS MOMENT. IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT MITCH HAD BEEN WAITING FOR. CERTAINLY, IT COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WAY MITCH REMEMBERS USC. AND IT CERTAINLY MIGHT HAVE HAD AN EFFECT ON THE WAY USC FANS REMEMBER MITCH. I WAS-- I THOUGHT THE OFFENSE WAS DOING REALLY WELL, RUNNING BACKS WERE RUNNING HARD, OUR RECEIVERS WERE READY TO GO. IT FELT GREAT, IT FELT LIKE WE WERE GONNA HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. I HAVE A TENDENCY TO BELIEVE THAT PART OF THE REASON HE STAYED OUT IN CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE HE KIND OF GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE L.A. LIFE STYLE. AND KIND OF, YOU KNOW, L.A. IS COOL AND THE GIRLS ARE COOL, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M LOVING MY LIFE, AND IF I DON'T PLAY FOOTBALL THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO ASK MITCH MUSTAIN FOR AN INTERVIEW HERE. AS YOU CAN SEE HE'S BEING VERY GENEROUS AND GIVING OUT HIS AUTOGRAPH TO A LOT OF THE YOUTH THAT HAVE BEEN HERE AND INVITED HERE TO THE PRACTICE TODAY. I MEAN, THERE'S A CERTAIN PRESTIGE THAT COMES WITH BEING A USC QUARTERBACK. WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING OR NOT... YOU KNOW, I WONDER, IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO REALLY DIG DEEP IN TERMS OF THE REGRET. WHAT DIDN'T HE DO THAT HE COULD'VE, WHAT DIDN'T HE DO THAT HE SHOULD'VE. I LOOK AT MITCH AND I SAY TO MYSELF, HE WAS STAR-CROSSED THE WHOLE WAY. AND THEN THIS WHOLE SELLING OF HIS A.D.D. MEDICATION ONLINE, WHERE IN THE WORLD DID THAT COME FROM? I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF A THRILL SEEKER. AND I'M NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT THRILL, I GUESS, BUT I HIT A POINT IN THE SUMMER OF '08 WHERE I REALLY BEGAN TO STRUGGLE WITH JUST BASIC SCHOOLWORK. AND NOT, NOT IN UNDERSTANDING IT. I UNDERSTOOD IT. BUT I HIT A WALL. I DID A BUNCH OF TESTS, AHEM, DIAGNOSED A.D.H.D. NO KIDDING, I MEAN, I THINK ANYBODY THAT KNOWS ME, INCLUDING MYSELF, COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT OFF THE BAT. IT'S JUST APPARENT TALKING TO HIM. I MEAN, HE'LL JUST DRIFT OFF AND BE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN SNAP BACK TO IT, YOU KNOW, FIVE MINUTES LATER. IS IT RAINING? [MATTINGLY] WE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I'M NOT A DOCTOR, AND I'M NOT IN THE MEDICAL FIELD, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I'M CLOSE TO THAT HAVE A.D.D. AND IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HOW IT CAN RUIN A LIFE, HOW IT CAN CHANGE A LIFE, HOW IT CAN MAKE SOMEBODY THAT HAS SO MUCH GOING FOR THEM, MOVE RIGHT OVER HERE JUST LONG ENOUGH TO SCREW SOMETHING UP. GOT ON THE MEDICATION FOR IT-- AHEM-- YOU KNOW, IT DID A LOT OF GOOD FOR ME, IN TERMS OF KIND OF PUTTING ME BACK IN THE ZONE WHERE I CAN FOCUS AGAIN. LEARNING THE PLAYBOOK. AND UNDERSTAND THE PLAYBOOK. UNDERSTANDING OUR GAME PLAN FOR THE WEEK. I CAN COME IN ON MONDAY AND GO THROUGH OUR INSTALL MONDAY AND JUST HAVE IT DOWN. JUST BOOM. BEING ON ADDERALL, AND HAVING THAT HELPED WAS A HUGE BENEFIT TO ME IN TERMS OF ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD AND EVEN IN THE CLASSROOM. ONCE I, ONCE MY BODY REALLY GOT BALANCED WITH IT, AND I'D BE-- AND UNDERSTAND, IT'LL NUMB THE PAIN BUT IT ALSO HURTS A LOT OF PARTS. I ACHED REAL BAD ON THEM, BUT I GET THE ADDERALL AND I'M REALLY STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE ASPECT OF IT. AND I DON'T LIKE IT. AND TALKING TO ONE OF MY DOCTORS I DECIDED I CAN LIVE WITHOUT THIS. I DON'T-- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO BE ON MY WHOLE LIFE. I QUIT COLD TURKEY. AND I MEAN, WE DIDN'T EVEN TAPER IT OFF. I JUST QUIT. IT WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST WEEKS OF MY LIFE. I MEAN, YOU JUST FEEL AWFUL, YOU'RE DOWN THE WHOLE TIME. ANYWAY, CAME BACK AND HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF EXTRA MEDICATION. THEY PULL A PRETTY FAIR MARKET PRICE. I THOUGHT, "HEY, WHY NOT." IT'S A THRILL. AND SO I PUT IT UP FOR SALE AND IT WENT FROM THERE. I GOT ARRESTED FOR IT. [SCHAD] IT NEVER REALLY SURPRISES ME WHEN ANY ATHLETE IS CAUGHT UP IN A SCANDAL INVOLVING DRUGS. CERTAINLY I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD MITCH MUSTAIN AND DRUGS. FROM ALL ACCOUNTS HE WAS A CLEAN KID. I TALKED TO HIS BROTHER ABOUT IT ONE DAY AND HE SAID, "YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW MITCH." HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. HE SAID HE GOT A KICK OUT OF IT. HE THOUGHT, "HEY, THEY'LL BE SOME GUY ON THERE THINKING HE'S GETTING SOME HEAVY DUTY PRESCRIPTION NARCOTICS HERE, AND IT'S JUST A.D.D. MEDICATION." FEBRUARY OF 2011, I GUESS AND I HAD SOME MISSED CALLS ON MY PHONE. FOR SOME REASON I WENT AHEAD A CHECKED THE VOICEMAIL AND IT WAS THE, I GUESS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND RIGHT WHEN I GOT THAT PHONE CALL I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. [MITCH MUSTAIN] YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY KIND OF IRRITATES ME IS I GOT ARRESTED AND I DIDN'T GET TO RIDE IN THE BACK OF A L.A.P.D. SQUAD CAR. I WAS IN THE BACK OF LIKE A SATURN. [LAUGHS] -[MATT MUSTAIN] WHAT? -BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR UNDERCOVER. [BOTH LAUGH] I DIDN'T GET TO RIDE IN THE CROWN VIC, MAN. DUDES WERE WEARING T-SHIRTS AND BLUE JEANS. AND DRIVING A SATURN. FUCKED UP. TO ME IT WAS KIND OF SAD TO THINK, YOU KNOW, SORT OF IN A RYAN LEAF WAY, I MEAN, HERE IS A GUY WHO SEEMED TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING WITH A FOOTBALL, AND NOW HERE HE IS. I'M JUST FUCKING CHILLING IN VAN NUYS. [LAUGHS] YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY THOUGH, IS I LEGIT SLEPT AS WELL AS I'D EVER SLEPT, IN JAIL. LIKE I JUST, I'M JUST LIKE, FUCK IT, I'M GONNA TAKE A NAP. I SLEPT LIKE A BABY. [LAUGHS] AND THANK GOD I WAS WEARING A SWEATER TOO, IT WAS COLD IN THERE. THEY DON'T FUCK AROUND. -[BIRD CAWS] -[MITCH WHISTLES] IT WASN'T A PROUD MOMENT AT ALL. IT REALLY WOKE HIM UP, I THINK AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW, "I'M NOT INVINCIBLE." I THINK IT HURT HIM A LOT, BUT I THINK WHAT IT REALLY DID, WAS IT GAVE AMMUNITION TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ALL ALONG SAID "THIS KID IS-- THERE'S SOMETHING MAJORLY WRONG WITH HIM." [SPORTSCASTER] OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE IN THE NEWS IN THE OFF-SEASON FOR REASONS YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPER THRILLED ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THAT AT THIS POINT-- I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING. I MEAN, I'LL TALK TO THE TEAMS ABOUT IT. IT COST ME BIG. IT TERMS OF THE HIT TO YOUR REPUTATION. THE HIT TO MY CAREER TO THAT POINT. I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF PLAYS TO BASE ON, BUT I STILL HAD ENOUGH TO WHERE, YOU KNOW, I WAS GONNA GET SOME LOOKS AND GET AN OPPORTUNITY, AND I THINK THAT REALLY KILLED A LOT OF IT. [REPORTER] I MEAN, DO YOU REGRET THAT I HAPPENED? YEAH, SURE. I DON'T KNOW WHY I WOULD, BUT YEAH, BUT NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT EXCEPT MOVING FORWARD. IT RUINED ANY CHANCE HE HAD AT THE NFL. I THINK THEY LOOKED AT THAT AND THOUGHT, "THIS GUY'S GOT A LOOSE SCREW." YOU COMBINE THAT WITH ALL THE OTHER DRAMA AT ARKANSAS. AND IT'S REAL EASY TO BELIEVE HE'S THIS GUY THAT WAS CREATED BY EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. I UNDERSTAND IT, AND, YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO YOU AND INVEST A LOT OF MONEY INTO YOUR TALENTS, UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A VERY SOUND INVESTMENT IF-- IF, YOU KNOW, IF YOUR INVESTMENT IS OUT THERE AND YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S GONNA BE A RISK, UH, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. [SPORTSCASTER] HOW DO YOU FEEL COMING INTO THE DRAFT? GOOD, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO GO TOO HIGH. [SPORTSCASTER] WHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK ARE YOU GETTING FROM TEAMS? [MUSTAIN] NOTHING AT THIS POINT, REALLY. NOTHING STRONG. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [NARRATOR] UNFORTUNATELY... NOT MUCH HAPPENED. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, MITCH WAS LEFT WITHOUT A BALL FIELD OR A TEAMMATE TO THROW TO. HE WENT FROM A COMMODITY, TO A LIABILITY. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) * I DON'T RECALL THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE * * YOU SAID IT'S MY FAULT * I STILL DON'T BELIEVE YOU * OH OH OH OH, ARKANSAS * * WE BOTH KNOW THIS WAS A MISTAKE * * I'D LOVE TO COME HOME * BUT I NEED AN ESCAPE * OH OH OH OH, ARKANSAS * FADE OUT * THIS IS WHERE THE CREDITS ROLL * * OUR NAME. [NARRATOR] THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNED HOME. BUT THIS TIME, THERE WAS NO FANFARE. MITCH MUSTAIN DAY WAS NOT CELEBRATED THAT DECEMBER. [SPORTSCASTER] AND IT IS OVER! [SPORTSCASTER #2] TIM TEBOW, ANOTHER MIRACLE COMEBACK. IN 2006, THERE WAS NO BIGGER NAME IN THE NATURAL STATE THAN MITCH MUSTAIN. [REPORTER] SIX YEARS AGO, MITCH MUSTAIN WAS A SHOE-IN TO BECOME A RAZORBACK LEGEND. AND WHEN HE WASN'T CHOSEN IN LAST APRIL'S NFL DRAFT, MUSTAIN MOVED BACK TO NORTHWEST ARKANSAS. HE TOOK A JOB WORKING AT A BENTONVILLE CAR DEALERSHIP TO PLAY THE BILLS. [MUSTAIN] I IMAGINE IT'S A LITTLE BIT SENSATIONAL TO SHOW THAT I WORK AT A CAR DEALERSHIP NOW OR PROBABLY WANT TO SHOW THE LONG FALL OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY WANT TO PORTRAY IT AS. WHICH IS FINE. I MEAN, IT'D BE PRETTY EASY TO MAKE IT A, UH-- YOU KNOW, THAT LONG FALL FROM GRACE TYPE DEAL. I MEAN, I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS GOING. PEOPLE CAN TALK ALL THE SHIT THEY WANT. IF THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TAKE THE TIME TO-- TO REALLY REFLECT ON HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO THEM, THAT'S FINE WITH ME. [NARRATOR] MANY OF THOSE WHO ONCE PRAISED MITCHELL HAVE SINCE TURNED ON HIM. AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION. BUT WHEN FANS TAKE ON A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT, THAT'S WHEN LINES GET CROSSED. WHAT HAPPENS ON MY RADIO SHOW EVERY MONDAY AFTER A GAME? JOE'S GOT HIS OPINION, BILLY BOB'S GOT HIS. YOU KNOW, FRANK IN BEVILLE HAS HIS. I MEAN, JUST EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING TO SAY. I WANT TO SAY MY PIECE. I'M GONNA TELL IT TO YOU RIGHT NOW. BUT I DON'T CARE, SCREW THAT GUY... [DJ] I NAMED MY DOG MITCH, HE LEFT. I SHOT IT. HE'S DEFINITELY A MAMA'S BOY, AND HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HIS MOM TO PROTECT HIM. HIGH SCHOOL PTA SHIT ISN'T GONNA CUT IT. HE'S PRETTY. TALL. SEXY. MITCH BAILED ON US. MITCH RAN AWAY. TRUE ATHLETES DON'T DO THAT. THEY FIND A WAY TO MAKE THEMSELVES BETTER. IS HE SELLING CARS NOW, I HEARD? YOU KNOW, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LOOK I'M NOT THE GUY WHO THINKS IT'S RIGHT TO SAY, "WELL, HE'S JUST THE KID, HE'S JUST 18." 'CAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN LEVELS OF EXPECTATIONS THAT COME WITH BEING IN THE PUBLIC EYE. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE LEVEL OF CRITICISM... AT A CERTAIN POINT, IT JUST-- IT'S BUFFOONISH. I MEAN, IT'S COMICAL. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN. YOU KNOW, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THE CRITICISM OF, YOU KNOW, "WELL, YOU GET YOUR SCHOOL PAID FOR," OR THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER. AND YOU ARE TO SOME DEGREE, YOU DO CHOOSE IT. I DID CHOOSE TO PURSUE THAT AVENUE. AND I DID CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE. SO I GUESS IT'S A TACIT ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOTORIETY OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH IT. WHAT THE BLOGS, THESE PEOPLE REALLY, I QUESTION WHETHER THEY SHOULD HAVE A VOICE SOMETIMES. WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU SO SELF IMPORTANT? WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR OPINION CARRIES ALL THAT WEIGHT? OKAY, THE OTHER DAY WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THE RESTAURANT WE WENT TO. FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES-- I MEAN IT WAS, THE WAITRESS WAS TERRIBLE. YOU HAVE THE SMELL OF SEWAGE DRIFTING FROM THE BATHROOM. IT WAS-- YOU KNOW, THE FOOD WAS GOOD. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE, WAS JUST A BAD EXPERIENCE. AND PART OF MY MIND WAS LIKE, "SHOULD I WRITE A REVIEW?" I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. AND THE SAD THING IS, IS THAT SOMEBODY-- IT IS GOING TO INFLUENCE SOMEBODY. THE FACELESS COMMENTS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DO ANY RESEARCH. HE'S JUST THE EASY TARGET. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS, BUT I WILL. [MUSTAIN] WE TALK ABOUT MARK SANCHEZ. I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW MUCH I DISLIKE THE GUY. AND MOST EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS HIM FEELS MUCH THE SAME WAY. BUT I SHIT YOU NOT, WHEN I READ COMMENTS ABOUT HIM, IT REALLY KIND OF IRKS ME, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE. I'VE BEEN THE ONE THAT THOSE SAME FUCKERS HAVE BEEN COMMENTING ABOUT, AND IT PISSES ME OFF. PEOPLE LOOK AT HIM AND THEY SEE SOMEBODY THAT'S SELFISH. WELL, LOOK IN THE MIRROR. SO YOU WANT TO RIP THIS KID, HE WAS A KID. WHEN IT COMES TO MITCH MUSTAIN ANY PERCEIVED CONFIDENCE OR ARROGANCE IS MORE BASED ON THE HUMAN INSECURITY AND CERTAINTY THAT WE ALL POSSESS. [MUSTAIN] THERE'S NO ATTEMPT OF UNDERSTANDING. IT'S JUST IGNORANCE. IT'S HUMAN NATURE. PEOPLE ARE DICKS. THAT'S JUST THE WAY SOME PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING TO-- THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO HURT. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO BE DAMAGING. AND ONCE I ACCEPTED THAT, IT TOOK ME A WHILE. BUT ONCE YOU GET YOU COME TO THE REALIZATION, IT BECOMES A LOT EASIER. THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE HATE MITCH MUSTAIN, IS A PATHETIC COMMENTARY ON WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE. NOT ON HIM. THEY LOVED MITCH MUSTAIN WHEN HE TOOK THE FIELD GETTING CRUSHED BY USC IN THAT FIRST GAME. YOU KNOW, THEY CHANTED FOR MITCH. BUT THEY WERE QUICK TO BOO HIM WHEN HE THREW A CRITICAL INTERCEPTION. I DON'T PULL THE SYMPATHY CARD, I'VE MADE MY DECISIONS, AND I'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING NEGATIVE IN AN INTERVIEW. I'VE NEVER ASKED FOR ANY SYMPATHY FROM ANYBODY. MITCH MUSTAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD STILL BE A HERO IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS. HE DID WHAT EVERYONE WANTED HIM TO DO. HE STAYED IN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS AND TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND YET IT STILL SEEMS LIKE IT WASN'T ENOUGH. -3 2 1. -HELLO, THE AX. [MAN CALLING IN] YOUR BOY'S GOT THIS MITCH MUSTAIN THING -ALL WRONG. -[DJ] OH WE HAVE IT ALL WRONG? OKAY, TELL US WHAT WE HAVE WRONG. [DJ #2] I THINK THIS IS MITCH MUSTAIN CALLING. [ALL LAUGH] SO WHAT IS DOING NOW? -SHOOTING GUNS IN THE WOODS. -IS THAT WHAT HE'S DOING? -THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO DO. -SELLING CARS. THIS MITCH MUSTAIN FELLER, HUH? I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I JUST DON'T GET, WHY YOU WOULDN'T BE A RAZORBACK THROUGH AND THROUGH. I'LL PLAY FOR THE DEVIL IF I COULD BE A HOG. I DON'T CARE. IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME NONE. WEARING THAT UNIFORM AND RUNNING THROUGH THE "A." OOIE! I'D LOVE TO GET ME SOME OF THAT. [SCHAD] IF YOU TELL YOURSELF THAT SOMETHING ISN'T THAT BIG A DEAL, THEN IT WON'T BE THAT BIG OF A LETDOWN IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND IF YOU TELL YOURSELF THAT SOMETHING IS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL AFTER THE FACT, THEN REALLY YOU'RE LIMITING THE DEPRESSION YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE. THERE WAS A TIME WHERE IT REALLY WAS JUST A MESS FOR ME. AND IT REALLY STRUGGLING WITH SOME THINGS. AND ONE OF THOSE DEALS, I JUST HAD TO GET SOME HELP. AND SEE AND JUST KIND OF HASH IT ALL OUT AND REALLY DO SOME REFLECTION ON IT. I FELT LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF DEMONS TO EXERCISE AND GET OUT THERE. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT, BUT, IT, AH-- IT IS HELPFUL. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASHAMED OF IT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. [WOMAN] WITH, WITH MITCH HE MAY HAVE HAD A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE HE WAS SWEPT INTO BEING THE ATHLETE AND THEN IT KIND OF TOOK A LIFE OF ITS OWN, PERHAPS. AND WHAT ABOUT BEING AN ATHLETE WAS FUN? WAS ANY OF IT FUN? DID HE LIKE THROWING? DID HE LIKE BEING WITH THE GUYS? DID HE LIKE THE RITUAL OF IT? DID HE LIKE THE STRUCTURE OF IT? AND TO SEE IF HE CAN SEE BEYOND WHAT THAT PARTICULAR IDENTITY OR PERSONA WAS. IT WAS JUST ONE WEEK AGO, MITCH MUSTAIN HAD A TRYOUT FOR A PRO BASEBALL TEAM. HE DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT. IF FACT, MITCH WAS STILL PLANNING ON PLAYING ARENA FOOTBALL THIS SPRING. I LOVED PLAYING IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND DIDN'T GET TO PLAY. I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE ITCH TO GET BACK INTO BASEBALL. [TV HOST] AND SO HE'S PREPPING TO POSSIBLY PITCH PROFESSIONALLY. I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS I'VE WANTED TO GET BACK INTO BASEBALL. I'VE HAD THE RESOURCES AND THE TIME TO DO IT RIGHT NOW. AND SO, IT'S A GOOD TIME. I FIGURED I'LL DO IT UNTIL THEY TELL ME THEY DON'T WANT ME AROUND AND THEY KICK ME OUT. THAT WILL BE THAT. BUT I'D HATE TO BE SITTING AROUND THINKING ABOUT IT LATER ON. [MATTINGLY] AS A PERSON, I JUST WISH THAT HE COULD DO AWAY WITH THIS IDENTITY OF BEING WHATEVER PEOPLE HAVE HIM PEGGED AS. IT'S SAD BECAUSE I THINK HE PROBABLY STILL CARRIES THIS AS HIS IDENTITY. MOST OF OF US AREN'T EVER GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE TO CARRY AROUND MY IDENTITY FROM WHEN I WAS 18. [MUSTAIN] THAT DOES DEFINE A BIT OF WHO I AM. BASEBALL WAS WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR ME FOR SEVERAL REASONS, TO GET OUT OF IT. TO GO DO SOMETHING ELSE, AND TO BE ABLE TO RESHAPE THE IDENTITY, I GUESS TO WHAT I WOULD THINK WAS JUST REHAB THE IDENTITY A LITTLE BIT. I CHOSE TO DO IT, BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF I COULD STILL DO IT. I JUST DIDN'T ENJOY BEING IN THE GAME. IT WAS STATIC. AND REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD THIS ITCH TO BE MOVING AGAIN. [TV HOST] HE ATTENDED TWO COLLEGES, WAS DRAFTED BY THE CHICAGO WHITE SOX APPLIED TO THE MARINES. PLAYED PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL IN CANADA AND WORKED IN A CAR DEALERSHIP. THAT'S A LOT OF LIVING FOR A 25 YEAR OLD NAMED MITCH MUSTAIN. I THINK HE'S STILL WANTING TO PLAY IN THE NFL, I THINK HE STILL HAS THIS IDEA THAT, "HEY, IF I GO OUT THERE AND DO GREAT THINGS IN THE ARENA LEAGUE, I CAN STILL BECOME A WARNER, I CAN STILL GO INTO THE NFL." THERE WILL COME A DAY WHERE I THINK I'LL KNOW THAT THE TIME'S UP ON IT-- PRETTY SOON PROBABLY, AND I'LL KNOW WHETHER I'M GOING TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE SHOT OR NOT. THERE'S ALWAYS THOSE FLYERS, KURT WARNER. HE WAS A LOT OLDER THAN I AM WHEN HE MADE IT. I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO GO ON AND TRY THESE THINGS, AND GIVE BASEBALL A SHOT AND ALL THAT. THAT'S FINE. BUT I THINK A LOT OF US, WE GET LOST IN AN EXCUSE IN OUR LIFE AND WE JUST KIND OF HANG OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW, MY LIFE 20 YEARS FROM NOW MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SPORTS. MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MILITARY, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I MAY BE WALKING THE HIMALAYAS SOMEWHERE, BAREFOOT. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHERE MITCH DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHO HE WAS AND WHERE HE WANTED TO BE. WHAT HIS PASSION WAS AND HOW HE WAS GONNA GET TO WHERE HE WANTED TO BE. LIKE MANY PEOPLE, WANTED TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. GOT THE FEELING THAT YOU WANTED TO HELP YOU BE HAPPY. THERE IS SOME I FEEL THAT I HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE. TO MYSELF, TO-- TO-- TO EVERYBODY. [NARRATOR] WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THIS STORY'S NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL. A CAN'T MISS KID TURNS INTO A BUST ALL THE TIME. IT HAPPENS. BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. I BLAME THE ADULTS. I WOULD NEVER BLAME THE KIDS. I DO THINK THEY WERE PUT IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. HOUSTON NUTT, THERE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A WORSE PERSONALITY MANAGING THIS SITUATION. I THINK HOUSTON NUTT PUTS MITCH MUSTAIN AND GUS MALZAHN IN THE SAME BOX. AND HE PUT THEM IN A BOX AND HE PUT IT ON A SHELF AND I THINK HE'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT THERE. [MUSTAIN] I THINK WE STARTED IN THE BOX, WHAT LITTLE RECOURSE WE HAD IF YOU EXERCISE IT GETS SPLASHED ALL OVER ESPN WITH WHATEVER NARRATIVE THEY WANT TO PUT ON IT. YOU DON'T LEAVE SOMEBODY TO HANG IN THE PUBLIC EYE AND THAT BE IT, BECAUSE YOU LET THAT SPEAK. ( SOUND OF MUFFLED HEARTBEAT ) GUS MALZAHN HAS DONE THINGS THROUGH OUT HIS COACHING CAREER THAT MAKE YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD. IT'S COMMON PRACTICE FOR COACHES TO TAKE OTHER JOBS AND NOT TELL THE PLAYERS THEY'VE RECRUITED. SO IT DOESN'T REALLY STUN ME THAT GUS DID WHAT HE FELT HE NEEDED TO DO FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY. GUS PUTS CONTROL FREAKS TO SHAME. WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER AN INNER CIRCLE, GUS HAS LESS THAN THAT. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT HE DID HOLD OUR BEST INTERESTS. BUT I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. WHEN IT ALL BEGAN, WITH BRINGING EVERYBODY FROM SPRINGDALE HERE, I THINK YOU SET A STANDARD OF YOU'RE GONNA LET OUTSIDE BEINGS AT LEAST WEIGH IN ON YOUR DECISION ON HOW YOUR PROGRAM IS GONNA BE RAN. I'M AWARE OF DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF EXAMPLES OF LITTLE LEAGUE PARENTS. IT WAS VERY EASY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THAT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THIS WOMAN, BET CAMPBELL, AND HER SON MITCH MUSTAIN. AND I HAD THAT VIEW AT ONE TIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW 'EM. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE THIS CONCEPTION THAT SHE'S JUST SOME CRAZY PSYCHO WOMAN THAT DEMANDS THINGS OR HER CHILDREN, AND, YOU KNOW, WANTS EVERYTHING HANDED TO THEM, BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK IT WAS ONLY THAT SEVEN MONTH PERIOD OF TIME, YOU KNOW, FROM THE START OF THE SEASON THROUGH JANUARY, I GUESS, THAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT SHE DID STUFF LIKE THAT. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A TRACK RECORD, IN HIGH SCHOOL OF GOING UP THERE AND DEMANDING THINGS FROM GUS. SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY RECORD AFTER THAT WHEN MITCH WENT OUT TO USC. SHE WAS NEVER KNOCKING ON PETE CARROLL'S DOOR OR LANE KIFFIN'S DOOR DEMANDING THAT MITCH GO IN MORE. HE PLAYED ONE GAME OUT THERE. [VOIGT] IT'S ALWAYS THE SIMPLEST EXCUSE, THAT PEOPLE WANT THE SIMPLEST REASON FOR SOMETHING. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE EASIEST DEFINITION, THE EASY WAY OUT. "OH, THAT PERSON'S CRAZY." [NARRATOR] IN THE END, WE ALL HAD A HAND IN THE IDENTITY THEFT OF MITCH MUSTAIN. AND NOW THAT THE DUST HAS SETTLED, THE ONLY THING THAT DIVIDES US IS WHETHER OR NOT WE OWN UP TO IT. I LIKE TO HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN IN THE PAST, EVEN BEFORE THEY BECAME AN ATHLETE. WHAT DID THEY USED TO LIKE TO DO FOR FUN? WHAT WERE THEIR ASPIRATIONS? WHAT WERE THEIR DREAMS? WHO WERE THEIR HEROES? AND THEIR WILDEST DREAMS, IF MONEY WERE NO OBJECT, IF FAMILY WERE NO OBJECT, WHAT WOULD THEY WANT TO DO? YEAH, I MEAN, I REMEMBER READING THAT ARTICLE ABOUT MATT BARKLEY AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. AND I REALIZED, THIS WASN'T IT. THEY TALKED ABOUT WHEN HE WAS WHAT, EIGHT, AND HE MAKES A VIDEO FOR HIS GRANDMOTHER'S BIRTHDAY, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO BE THE QUARTERBACK AT USC. AND THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER... YOU KNOW, IT HIT REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AT POINT THAT WE SORTA TAPPED ON BEFORE, BUT I HADN'T REALLY FELT OR BELIEVED, AND THAT WAS THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T-- IT WASN'T MY DREAM. AND, YOU KNOW, FOR ALL THE TIMES I SPENT WONDERING, WHAT AM I MISSING? WHY DO I NOT FEEL AS INVESTED IN THIS? OR WHY-- WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I'M MISSING SOMETHING HERE? THAT WAS THE MOMENT IT WOULD ALL KINDA CAME TOGETHER. I REALLY STARTED KINDA REWINDING THROUGH MY LIFE AND WONDERING, IF PERHAPS, I MISSED THE TURN, YOU KNOW, WHERE I-- I REALLY WAS REALLY MEANT TO BE. AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY. I DON'T THINK HUMANS IN GENERAL, BUT CERTAINLY I KNOW I DON'T MYSELF-- I DON'T HAVE THE INSIGHT TO-- I DON'T HAVE THE WISDOM TO SAY-- YES OR NO TO DEFINITIVELY, THAT I'M IN THE WRONG PLACE. AND I'M-- I... THINK, YOU KNOW, I HESITATE TO SAY THAT. [NARRATOR] WHEN MITCHELL SIGNED UP TO FIRST PLAY FOOTBALL, HE WAS SIGNING UP FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT WOULD END BAD. THE GAME WILL ALWAYS OUTLIVE THE ATHLET. AND FOR MITCHELL... SOME HABITS DIE HARD. PERHAPS, IT'S AN ADDITION. OR PERHAPS IT'S JUST HOPE. * LONG BEFORE THE END * BEFORE THE SKY WAS GRAY * WE WERE INNOCENT * SO YOUNG, SO STRONG AND BRAVE * * THE WORLD HAD JUST BEGAN * WE WERE YET KINGS AND QUEENS * * BUT AUTUMN TOOK THE SUN * AND WITH IT SUMMERS DREAM * * NOW TRY FORGETTING * BUT IT WON'T LET ME GO * AND TIME MOVES SLOW * FOR WARRANT DREAMS SOULS * OUR FATHERS NEVER CARED TO SHOW * * WHERE TOMORROW GOES * ( VOCALIZING ) * I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WENT * * A DREAM I THOUGHT WAS MINE * BUT QUICKLY DAYS WERE SPENT * * ON SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE * AND NOW THIS DREAM * IS ALL THAT I CAN HEAR * AND TEARS TO MELODY * STILL WAITING ALL THESE YEARS * * AND I TRY FORGETTING * BUT IT WON'T LET ME GO * AND TIME MOVES SLOW * FOR ONE DREAM SOULS * AND OUR FATHER'S NEVER CARED TO SHOW * * WHERE TOMORROW GOES * AND NOW I START TO SEE * BEHIND THE STORIES TOLD TO ME * * THAT ALL MY FATHER'S SINS * HIS FATHER GAVE TO HIM * AND TIME MOVES SLOW * FOR ONE DREAM SOULS * THE ONE THING WE WILL NEVER KNOW * * IS THIS TIME MOVES SLOW * FOR WONDERING SOULS * OUR FATHER'S NEVER CARED TO SHOW * * WHERE TOMORROW GOES. * ( VOCALIZING )
