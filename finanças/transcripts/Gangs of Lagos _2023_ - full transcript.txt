Greetings. What are you doing? Sorry, darling. Give me that bag. Will you get this thing out of my face? Hey, look here. - Give him the bag. - My God. Please have mercy... Take this! This is gold. Help! London! This guy can't do it. I can do it. This one wants to go to America. - Leave it. - What? Don't throw it out. She'll need it. Ify, use your brain! Use your head! This could get us in trouble. Are you the boss? I am the boss. No! I am the boss. You, who was afraid of that fat woman? My father was a great king. You have to listen to what I say. Okay, then. If you are the boss, then Teni's my girl. What is it with you guys and this girl? What is it? You're the boss. Thanks for coming. That woman almost shat herself. You're my blood, and no one messes with my blood. How about me? Chill. You're our bro. - Street brothers for life. - Street brothers for life. - Street brothers forever. - Forever! Swear on your life! Ugh! Why are you acting like a girl? Am I not a girl? No, you're a boy! Hey, how's it kicking? Alaye Bam Bam. - Well done. - Of course. Akinwale. They want 15 local governments to win... in the upcoming state primaries. That's easy. I swear. You know we got this. Kazeem. I would like you to give Akinwale and I a few minutes of privacy. Don't worry about it. Baba. I am tired of this street life, Baba. Honestly. I've saved quite a bit of money. Baba. I am ready to start a new business. Akinwale. I know you are still a young man, but that does not mean you should not be wise. Look, let me tell you. Don't be deceived. Look, let me tell you. That every aspiring, young Isale Eko boy is dreaming of. Listen, even Kazeem is no match for you. You better wise up! What's wrong with you? Just imagine! Greetings to you, sir. - Thank you. - Greetings. - Thank you. - Greetings to you. - Thank you. - There you go, sir. Madam. I'm sorry. You said your bag was stolen. - If this was in Isale Eko like you said... - Yes, sir. - Then, you can relax. - Hello, sir. Terrible! Here's the bag. We found it. That's him! That's him! Woman, relax! I'm sorry, sir. Sorry. Get up, child of God. What's your name? There were two. The other one ran... Where's your friend? I'll slap you so hard... Terrible. Baba. It was just me, sir. My name is Akande, but they call me Obalola. Really... Obalola? Why is that? - You're the son of a dead king? - Yes, sir. - You're Ogunmola's son? - Yes, sir. Come closer. Let's look at you. You are your father's son. Look. You know what we'll do? You see, you're going to return the bag to her, because you don't bring harm to your own people. You understand? Yes, sir. But she has gone to the cops. Madam. You told the police? I just had to formally report my missing passport... No need to explain at all. You see, the officers you went to report the case to... You'll have to go to them. - That's right. - To find your lost bag. Have I upset you? - Terrible! - Yes, Baba. We don't bring harm to our own. Obalola! Teni. Teniola! Stay in the car! Put your head back in! "Obalola..." Obasco! Smart boy. You made a lot of money today. You can't fool me, all right? I'll just throw a punch at you. Look... I know you didn't steal the bag by yourself. You're protecting your friend, right? We don't bring harm to our own. So, which police station did you see her walk into? So, how did you know she went to the police? Obasco! You're no ordinary boy. I see now you're truly your father's son. - Yes, sir. - Wonderful. But you need to listen to me. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. What? Thank you. Well played, boy. If you need anything, ask for Ninalowo on Ricca Street. That's where Teni lives. Kazeem's daughter? I saw you staring at her. They live next door. What are you doing here? Take your evil blood money and leave my son alone! Madam, I was just talk... Don't speak to me. I don't want to hear your voice! What did I do to this child? Why do you want to ruin me? But I won't let you! I won't let the devil take your soul! You hear me? You know what? We're going to the Aladura! - Come. - No, Mommy, please. - Mommy, please... - Don't make me slap you! Let's go! Mommy, please... Darkness cannot overcome light Heavenly host Bow down to Christ The power of God trumps the power of darkness Darkness cannot overcome light Heavenly host Bow down to Christ The power of God trumps the power of darkness Darkness cannot overcome light Heavenly host Bow down to Christ The power of God trumps the power of darkness... My darling... You know I'm doing this all for you. I'm doing it so the evil spirits in you can leave. So I can rest knowing you will live long and be prosperous. Be strong. The pain shows that God is working in you. The battle is won! Obalola. I wasn't expecting you so soon. I'm looking for a place to stay. Who did this to you? Come. Come in. Do we have a guest? We have a son. Ninalowo... Obalola, come in. Obasco. All of this... is yours. I want you to relax. And sleep well tonight. Don't worry about anything. We'll talk tomorrow. Smart boy. Don't worry. Obalola. Obalola. Oba. Teniola Olaotan. - Where's my child? - Your child? Evil woman! How can you treat your child like that? - Bring me my child! - Talk to me. Leave the boy alone. - If you don't leave... - What can you do? Honey, come back inside. Bring me my child. - What child? - I know you're hiding him. So just go in and bring him to... My Akani. My darling. Thank God. Come, let's go. I'm not going. Leave these evil people! Let's go home! I'm not going. You have to leave the boy. The boy says he's not going to leave. I dare you to step foot in this house! You're not leaving with me. So, it is not a curse. You see, this path... This is the path your father took with these evil people, these criminals... It's the same path you want to follow. This path... - It will lead you to your death. - Enough! Never will you speak to this boy in that way again. Ever been to these houses before? This is where rich and important people live. One day, we'll live in a place like this. They don't have two heads, right? Akinwale! Sit here and wait for me. I'll be back. Olorogun Araba. Obasco! Oba. Oba! Wait for me in the car. Whatever you do, don't leave this car. They didn't tell me anything! Shut up! Have mercy... Listen. I can keep cutting you until the sun comes up. I won't even get bored. You will pray for death, but no. You won't die until I'm ready to kill you. My ear! Obalola! I told you to wait in the car. Nino. You've brought a child here. I couldn't leave him alone at home. This is good. Looks like the kid has the stomach for this. Holding a knife to a child's neck? The dead king's son. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Look, he was born for this life. No one is born for this life. It's been a week. No one has seen her. We have given the police all our savings, but they are too scared to go and search that place. Please help me. That man has promised her that he will take her to London, but we heard he uses people to smuggle drugs. Please help me. You should have come to me earlier. I didn't know better. I know London very well. If your daughter is with him, I'll get her out. London! London! Where are you? Who's barking like a dog in my club? You're talking to Ninalowo. The girl in this picture. She's one of mine. I heard you have her. Yeah, she's really here. The girl in the picture and all the other girls here. - They're all paid for. - Return her! You can't have this girl. Listen. You can look out your windows if you want. I came with an army. I either leave with the girl, or we all die here tonight. - Arrow. - Boss. Go get the whore so these bastards can get the hell out of here. London. Till we meet again. You know what that means. Get the fuck out of my club! You too, you knockoff white man. Hope you're doing all right, ma'am. - Nino! - Greetings, my people. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria. He says I have a head for books. Unbelievable. So, wait... - Don't start again! - You? Never! Calm down, it's okay. No! For me? Look at me... Obasco! You're really enjoying this food. I'll see you later. - Yes, sir. - Smart boy. Good kid. - Take care! - All right. Good. You're the king of men! What is it? - Mama, pay up. - Money, money! - Pay up. - Money, every time! - Good day. - Good day. Come on. This is heavy. Hey! What are you doing here? Ify the collector! What is it? - My son. - That's Kazeem. Don't let him hear you call me that. That was in his time. This is your own time now. You're the boss now. Let me give you corn. Leave the corn. I'm here for Kazeem's money. Is that so? Okay, then. Mama Nkechi! Come. This is Mama Nkechi. She's my friend. Yes... She doesn't have money this month. Relax... Be patient, my son. I know, but Kazeem doesn't want to hear it. - The election's coming. His eyes are red. - That man is too greedy... - Be careful what you say. Walls have ears. - But he is. But it's true. If he and Olorogun collect everything, what will the rest of us eat? But Kazeem protects you. What protection? My son protects me! - I know what you're doing. - It's working... Where's Wemimo? Aren't these Kazeem's boys? We've got trouble! Lunatics! Wemimo. If you don't come out right now, I'll blow your head off. My brother, please. Hey! Brother Wemimo! How's everything? Don't you dare tell her. Everything's fine... Where's your money? Count it! Yeah, that's a good boy. Where's your money? Bring the money. Count it! Is it all there? - It is. - Good boy. How much money did you bring? Get out of the car! - Get out of the car! - I'm out. - Have mercy. It was the devil. - Tell him when you meet him. How's it going? Please have mercy. Alaye. Please... Please... I'm done for... We've had enough. We're done. We don't want you any longer. Is it right for one family to hold a whole state hostage for the past 20 years? This is not a monarchy. Why not use their own kids? Their kids are abroad while our children die every day in the streets. Why? Useless woman. She's all talk. We own the streets. Wemimo! Is that you? How are you? Come on, don't be scared. Relax. Feel at home. Come. Come sit. Wemimo... Relax. Come closer. - Sir... - Don't be shy. You cannot steal from my collections. - Suddenly, you've lost your voice. - Actually... Actually, sir... it was a miscalculation. - Really? - Yes, sir. A miscalculation? You know what? I'm inclined to believe you. A miscalculation. Yes, sir. But you know, I have eyes and ears everywhere. Please, sir! Man, go inside. Wemimo! I'm dead! I'm dead. How's it going? Have they come for their meat? - No, they haven't. - They haven't come... - Please... - Come this way. Please, sir... Please, sir. Wemimo, do you still insist it was a miscalculation? I'll confess. - I did it. - You did it? I did it. But it wasn't me. It was an evil spirit. It was madness. An evil spirit... A miscalculation... I'm a butcher's son. I have been butchering since I was a child. Next time, when someone sends you to steal from me... you either kill them yourselves... or, in the words of Jesus Christ... "Bring them to me." Obasco! Sir. Well done. Your friend is coming back. - Teni? - Yes. You see, this election is going to get really tough. I told her not to come home, but the girl is too stubborn. That's Teni. I got her a job on the island through a friend. So I bought her an apartment. But... I want you to be her personal bodyguard. Understand? Be her security. Nothing can happen to Teni. She's all I have. Nothing will happen to her. I trust you. That's why I chose you. Take this. Who is it for? It's yours. For what? Take care of yourself. This is too much. Come on. You're like a son to me. Ninalowo's son is my son. If I don't take care of you, who will? Obasco! 50,000 naira. Me? O ma japa. Let's hope it all works out. Pana... Everybody come and dance for me Pana is here, let's have some isi ewu God is my strength, I can never fall Everyone has his time Life is turn by turn I'm on fire Let nobody come with water I'm not retiring I'll pop until kingdom come They say, "No time..." It's all God. If you check the time... It is Pana time I heard you want to talk? - That's right. - Go on. I have a bulk shipment of coke. I only trust you with it. Have you guys lost your minds? In my hood? - Have you lost your mind? - Kashope! - Oba! - Calm down. - Take my name out of your mouth. - Calm down. Seems like you lost your mind. I'll hit you... I said calm down! You calm down. Why bring a gun to a knife fight? Relax! Relax! Barman. For the damage. If you want to live, don't try anything stupid. And if you shoot and miss? You'll die for nothing. Try me. His head's like a goat's head. Say it in Yoruba, bastard. He said you look like a goat. - Filthy witch! - Demon! - I'll hit you. - I'll ruin you! Kash. Kashope Obasegun. We'll meet again! Dear God. We should have beaten Kashope up. He's such an idiot. - Your place or your mother's place? - She won't do anything... Ifeanyi! Ifeanyi. So you're here. Look at this bastard. I've been looking everywhere for you. Who's this? You better run. He'll get you pregnant then disappear! Ifeanyi... You! You did this to me. What do you want to explain? How you didn't show up at the hospital when I was giving birth? You sent your stupid friend to bring me 50,000 naira. Worthless money. How dare you! Blessing! What sort of rubbish talk is that? Do you know where I live? Do you know where I sleep? You know where your child is? Don't. We got kicked out when I couldn't pay rent. I slept on the streets... for two days, Ify! It won't end well for you. Blessing, look at me. Calm down. Take us to where you're staying. You're moving out tonight. Ify will do right by you. Even if I have to break his head. You hear? Why didn't you swear in Satan's name? You stupid idiot. Don't kick me when I'm down. Hope this won't get you in trouble one day. You're senseless. Anyone who hears a baby's cry should come Come see that it is a child And the child is not for one person Anyone who hears a baby's cry should come Come see that it is a child And the child is not for one person... My boy! My boy! Just look at how handsome my boy is. Look at his perfect little nose! This boy is going to grow up to be great. - Yes. - So... We will name him after your grandfather, my husband. Ikechukwu David. Because this boy will be great! Yes! Just like your father! Like your mother too... You see, my boy here... He will cause problems. So... Listen, babe. I'm just waiting for one thing. See, once my music blows up like this... I'll marry you. Lies! Shut up over there and stop swearing! Even your mom knows you're lying. Guys, I'll never forget what you guys did for me tonight. - You teasing me? - I'm not. Street brothers for life. That's right. That's gross! Obalola! Teni. Will you ever let go of each other? It's like they're in an Indian film. Is it really you? It's been 10 years. You sure you went to America? Where's the accent? What silly accent? I'm just an Isale Eko girl. Ebun! Eruku! I'm loyal! You're so local! You sure you went to the real America? I'm local and proud! That's right. Igbo boy! Igbo boy! What are you wearing? He's a baby daddy now. What happened? I have so much to tell you. You won't believe what happened... Obasco! Tenilola. Look who's talking. Don't you know you're all grown up too? - Sir. - Oba. How are you? Remember the apartment I told you I bought for Teni? That's where you'll take her. I've sent you the address. No problem. She's my everything. - You hear? - I'll take care of her. I trust you. You two have an errand. Come on, let's go. Igbo boy. You're with me. Let's go. Why does your mouth stink so bad? Just because I joke around with you... Don't be like that with me. You should ask why I'm called Terrible. I'm terrible! I'm warning you. I don't know why Eleniyan told you to join us. You probably sleep with him. This job we're doing isn't child's play. You need to be smart! Very smart. Can't do this if you're not. Wait... How many people are going to live here? Don't be silly. I know it's big. Nice. It even has a balcony. Teni, do you really own this place? Technically, it's my dad's, but he bought it in my name. Curse my father's killer. While we Eruku suffer on the streets for Kazeem, notice how he and his own are enjoying life. I should go too. Who will stay and keep watch if you come with us? Just because the boss trusts you, doesn't mean... Let's move! Enjoy yourself like there's no tomorrow... Ify. I have good news for you. Yes. Remember my producer friend you want to work with? I've spoken to him and he says you should come and perform for him this weekend. Don't prostrate while you're driving. Look where you're going. Thank you, sir. I won't disappoint you. You wouldn't dare. - Alaye. - Alaye. Panama. Alaye. Eleniyan. Good afternoon, sir. - How are you? - We're fine, sir. Pack up! What's going on? You've cut half my hair. What's going on? I've been waiting. You haven't even massaged my head. You crazy or what? I said get the fuck out of here! We're closed! Sorry about that, sir. Now, you leave. I knew my eyes weren't deceiving me. It's been 16 years. But you're a coward. We could have met anywhere. Why would you ambush me here? The battle is wherever we are. Or have you forgotten my promise that we would meet again? If you weren't a coward, we wouldn't be meeting here. You know you're no match for me, so you ambush me here, where I'm exposed. Only traitors have something to fear. If you've done nothing, you have nothing to fear. Kazeem. Your loyalties are misplaced. Olorogun will betray you. And you will betray the hand that fed you? Tajudeen, for what? For this woman? Someone who's going nowhere? Shouldn't Olorogun's reign end? After over 20 years... of ruling over Lagos. His time is up! Such a pity. You've forgotten. You've forgotten the past. You used to roam the streets like a madman. High off your mind on all sorts of drugs. Then, Olorogun found you. Had mercy on you poor soul. Then changed your life. Changed your life! Now you think you can meddle in the affairs of Lagos? Shut the fuck up! What right do you have? To speak over us Lagosians? Bastard with no pedigree. I was born here in Lagos Island. My family's house is on Campos Street. Who the hell is your father, you fucking bastard? Keep running, madmen! Why are you running? - Stay and fight. - You're all lucky. Running away, huh? Pick it up. It's Ify. I'll call him back. I remember the day you moved in with Nino. Me too. I was going through so much shit back then. Then, I saw you. And I felt like life would be okay. You liked me that much? You messing with me? You knew I liked you. But you got ahead of me now. You've gone abroad. Bet you've met big boys in America. Guys who've gone to university. Not like us high school dropouts. My dear Oba. None of that really matters. School doesn't matter. Which school did he go to? Right? Which school did he go to? What happened to you? You used to be all, "School, school..." You were all about going to school. What would school get you? Power is what really matters. Eruku. Girl... You've changed a lot! Really? I thought you said I was the same Teni from Isale Eko. Nah, I was foolish to think that. You're your father's daughter. Sit and wait for the Eleniyan. Ifeanyi. How are you? You've done well. I'm impressed with you. You held your own yesterday. There's something I need you to do. What is that? You've heard the news. So, you know we can't have anyone talk... Sir. I would never. Not you. Not you! I'm not worried about you. Listen. The barber. I need you to take care of him. - I don't understand, sir. - What don't you understand? Take care of him. Make sure he will never... utter another word again. When you're done, come to the club so you can perform for the producer. - Tonight, sir? - Of course. You're not ready? No, sir. I'm ready. When you're done, come and meet me at the club. Thank you, sir. Listen... no need to thank family. Look. I'm loyal to my own. Only to my own. And I expect loyalty... from my own in return. Who is that? Man, I've been calling you since yesterday night. You ruined my door. I was taking Teni around. Kazeem killed London. What? BJ? Yes. So we get to the shop, and I thought Kazeem wanted a haircut. London was reading a newspaper, and they were talking, and before you know it, Kazeem just shot the guy. Maybe Olorogun ordered it. It's everywhere. See, it's already on the news. I'm a Lagosian. I was born here. Same night he arranges for me to meet the producer. Kazeem? Come on, keep up! How can I calm down? As we were leaving... I saw Kash. He saw me. He's Ekun's son. Though he's a fucking traitor, Ekun won't touch Nino's son. They know you can't kill a capo... when you're not mad. Lay low till tonight. We'll go together to the barber then. You'll kill him? Oba... I talk a lot of shit, but I've never killed before... Calm down. We're not killing anyone. Unless he's unreasonable. We'll convince him to leave Lagos. Then tomorrow, we'll go and see Ekun. Stop shaking. Take your phone. What's up? And do what? I'll bring you something. Teni. Don't stay too late. All right. Where are you? I have eyes on BJ. Don't do anything. Just wait for me. Pana, where are you? He's here! Really? I'll be there soon. Hurry up. That was so much fun. - You're going with them? - I am. - I'll call you. Bye, ladies. - Let's go. - I got you duck. - Teni, get in the car! - You're yelling at me. - I don't have time, get in the car! Oba... What have I done to you? Not everything is about you, Teni. Something is wrong, and instead of sulking and taking it out on me, let's talk. Really? You want to talk? Okay, let's talk. Let's talk about how your father has all of us in the streets, collecting from everyone, no matter how little they have, so you guys can live like kings. You know how big your apartment is? It's big enough for 30 people! You want us to talk, right? Let's talk! Let's talk about how he sends young boys, barely teens, to die every day on the streets. For what? So your family can have power! You sit there comfortably in the back, watching me drive you every day. Me, Obalola Akande. You're okay with me being your driver and security, right? I don't have hopes and dreams, right? My friends... People I love... Who's going to protect them? Oba. But I did, right? I asked for this life? Come off it. Oba! Risi? Is that you? Did you forget something? Please. I've done everything you've asked. Kazeem said I would be a protected man. Thank you so much... Look, with the kind of shit you're in, and the people looking to kill you... If they see as much as your shadow, you and everyone you care about will be hunted down and killed. I swear to you, I'll disappear. You'll never see me again. Teni! Teni! Teni! Teni. - Teni! - Oba! - Don't be scared. - Hey! Put your hands up. Leave her. Take me instead. Who the fuck are you? Touch me one more fucking time, and I shoot your head off. Gift! Where are you? They're calling your name. Panama! Pana! Put your gun down, or we shoot your guy! Teni, don't listen to him! Sorry... It's nothing. Let me look at it. I should apologize. If I hadn't been talking all that shit, I would've seen it. If anything had happened to you, I would never forgive... I'll kill you... Pana! - Pana! - Pana! Ify! Ify! Ify! Ify! Oba, pick up your fucking phone! Pana! Ify! Ify! Ify! What would they say? It's Gift and Pana you should worry about. They'd tease us. What is it? What's wrong? Oba, tell me. What's the matter? Gift, where's Pana? Where were you? Where the fuck were you? You were supposed to be with him! Where the fuck did you go? He was all alone! He was all alone. My son! My son. They killed my son. When they took his father... I didn't complain. I accepted it. I didn't complain. I accepted it. Who am I to question God? Who am I? But you see... I will not accept. I will not accept. Look at my son's face! Look at him! They wanted to cover the coffin, but I refused. All of you, use your eyes to see what they did to my son! My own child. God, who fights for me! God, who conquers all my battles! God, who listens and answers me! God, who wages war against those in battle with me. Stand and fight for me! The time is now! All those involved in the death of my son! They should fall, one after the other! For every scar, ten men shall fall! Isale Eko must not know peace... Mark my words. Isale Eko must not know peace until the wrath of God is felt. Until the wrath of God is felt! Ifeanyichukwu... Show no mercy. Ifeanyichukwu, show no mercy... My God... hear my cry. Show no mercy. Kash! Ekun! If you're men, come out here. Come finish what you started. I hear a dog barking. I'm here. On our turf. Come finish what you started. You're a fool. Boys, finish him! I can see you're ready to meet your maker. You're a tough guy, right? You smell like death. Ready to die. I'll take you with me. No weapons. I'll kill you with my bare hands. - Let's go! - You're unlucky. You! You! Take my chain off! - I'm your final boss. - You can't handle me. Useless kid. Hey, Bruce Lee! You need to calm down. You traitors. How could you do this? How could you kill Nino's kid? Where did you hear that I killed him? You'll lie about seeing him at the barber's? Cowards. Just 'cause you can't kill Kazeem. Pana. Harmless Pana. Are you dumb? You've got eba for brains. Listen to me. Oba, listen to me! When you were a child, Nino would tell us how smart you were. Wise beyond your years. Now... the sun's melted your brain. Don't take me for a fool! London was your gang's boss. This was payback. You're not a kid anymore. Stop acting like one. Use your head. Use your head. - Who killed London? - Eleniyan. Who sent Ify to kill Bolaji the barber? - How did you know? - Answer me. Eleniyan. Now we're getting somewhere. I'll tell you what happened. When we eventually found the barber, he told us what happened that day. I went to Olorogun and insisted that he let us kill Kazeem. Olorogun called us to a meeting. Kazeem said it was London who drew his gun first. He said it was Ifeanyi who shot London. I knew they were lying. It was obvious they were determined to make Ifeanyi take the fall. Your enemy is closer to you... than you know. You know these things happen on the streets. An eye for an eye. Blood for blood. They agreed for Terrible to kill Ifeanyi. But if they failed, we would capture Teni. Why do you think we let you go then? You thought an angel intervened? Free him. When you're ready to take on Kazeem, I have an army. Waiting for you. Understand? You know I don't like you for shit. But Kazeem's had it coming for a while. His time's up. Get up. Get up. Come on, get up. Alaye. Eruku. Ify was just about to blow up... He just recorded a new track to perform that night. I can't believe he's gone. We don't bring harm to our own. But they killed Ify. What was his crime? Pana just wanted to have fun. They butchered him like an animal in the streets. I know Kazeem is insane, but not with family. And that fucking bastard Terrible! That traitor Baba Adekunle. Kazeem is not my family. I'll kill them all. They broke the rules. So all bets are off. Everyone who cut him... Who held him down... If all they did was watch... Vengeance is mine. Even if it costs me my life, I won't stop till Kazeem is dead. Move, and I'll blow your fucking brains off! What is this? How dare you! Have you gone mad? Rosy. Come get your money. You're part of this? You set me up? Don't stain my sheets if you kill him. I got a customer. Leave. You! You set me up. I'm screwed! Open your fucking mouth! Please don't kill me. Please... I'm begging you, please. Please... You handle Kazeem's weapons. Yes, I know where they are. Shut the fuck up! Look at him. Fucking bastard! Come out here! You're crazy. - Move! - Let me go. - Let me go... - I'll blow your head off. I've told you I'll take you there. Why do this? - I'll blow your head off. - Let me go. I told you I'll take you there. I'll bring you there. Who are you? Oba. What are we waiting for? Let's kill this motherfucker. Wait, wait... I know something you'll want to know. Oba, this snake is lying. Terrible. Speak. I'm listening. I need your word you will have mercy on me when I tell you this. Fuck mercy! Oba. If you don't kill this bastard, I'll do it myself. Terrible, relax. You have my word. I am sure you've heard the stories about how loved your father was. Your father didn't like Olorogun one bit. He knew Olorogun wanted to rule Lagos for his own selfish gain. So he threw his weight behind Bamidele's father. Which Bamidele? The one running for governor? Your father was influential, and everybody knew Olorogun would lose the election. That's how... Kazeem and Olorogun's unholy alliance came to be. Olorogun sent Kazeem to kill your dad. It was a bloodbath. They killed Bamidele's dad, Ify's dad, and anyone loyal to both of them. And Alaye Bam Bam? Who do you think took Kazeem to Olorogun? MOM Keep it down! Mommy, this is your son... Oba. Hello, Mommy. I don't know that name. Mommy, it's Akande. I said I don't know who you are. Please don't hang up. You may never... hear my voice again. I know who killed my dad. I swear I'll kill... FAREWELL LONDON Teni! Get out of the way! Help me! What is happening? Hide under the table! Kazeem! Traitor! It's your day of reckoning. It's over. If you're man enough, drop the gun and fight me like a man. I don't need a gun. I'll kill you with my bare hands. You silly little boy. You think you can defeat me? - You killed my father. - He was a fool. A fool who wanted to give up everything so the people would love him. Nobody loves you! I don't need their love. I'm a leader. It's who I am. A leader does what is necessary. Street kid. I'll finish you. We'll see who's boss now. Come this way. I'm going to kill you! It's over for you! - My son. Please. - Not your son. Butcher's son. Gangster. Eruku! Street rat! I've been called everything. Well, this butcher's son will rule Lagos. So it wasn't London... who killed Nino. It was you. I always thought you had what it takes for greatness. That you had the guts. The courage to be Eleniyan like me. But you're just like your fathers. Greet them when you get there. Greet them yourself. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! No! Daddy! Kadara. Oba. Is this you? - They can't stop it. - Not in this lifetime!
