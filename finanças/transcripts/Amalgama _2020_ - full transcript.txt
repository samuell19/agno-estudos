Briefly and in conclusion, our 30-year-old patient was diagnosed with total denture loss due to untreated periodontal disease. To reconstruct, we carried out a progressive treatment with a total duration of between eight and ten months. We made sequential extractions and then placed a temporary acrylic total prosthesis and then placed a temporary acrylic total prosthesis to prevent the patient from having the trauma of looking or feeling edentulous. We placed the implants for the final positioning of the zirconia bar, where we put the individual and definitive crowns to simulate and perfect our patient's original teeth. The challenge was to reduce physical pain to a minimum and avoid any possible emotional pain. The results are obvious, a denture that is easily cleaned, an almost painless treatment, a beautiful smile, higher self-esteem, and a totally satisfied patient. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Dr. Vera, for this excellent presentation. Now let's move on to the Q and A. The dynamics will be very simple, raise your hand, and we'll get a microphone over to where you're sitting. Anyone? Over there, please. Thank you. Hi, I am Dr. Elena Durán. This isn't a question. I would like to congratulate Dr. Vera for this magnificent treatment. I'm sure that his innovative technique will revolutionize dental aesthetics and functional surgery in the 21st Century. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Thank you. Definitely. Anyone else? There, please. I'm Dr. Avelino Magaña. I'm sorry to question the professional ethics of Dr. Vera, but this procedure has already been improved and performed by myself in Santo Domingo. I'll present it here tomorrow and will publish it next month on Odontology Journal. I wonder how you got the grounds of my treatment, Dr. Vera? Which, by the way, is faster. Resulting in higher income, fewer working hours, and a lot less emotional stress. The grounds of my treatment, Dr. Magaña, are mine. - I hope you can prove it, Doctor. - Of course, I can. It seems that you're forgetting about the patient, Doctor. All the benefits you mentioned are only for the physician. What about the patient? Our duty is to heal as quickly and efficiently as possible. Furthermore, you are forgetting our main responsibility, Dr. Vera, to act strictly in accordance with professional ethics, because plagiarism has serious consequences. I did not plagiarize anyone. - What's up, Hugo? - Hey, Saúl! - How are you doing, man? - Terrible, man! Why? - Can you believe that Magaña bastard? - Yeah, right… What was all that about? Did you know about his treatment? - Of course not! - So? The bastard's accusing me of plagiarism when he's plagiarizing me! Damn… - There are no morals anymore. - None! And you know that I've been breaking my back over this - for two years… - Absolutely. - I know, man. - For real. - So you two know each other… - Yeah. Yeah, we go way back to our specialty days. Sorry, I didn't introduce you. Dr. Elena Durán, Dr. Saúl Bravo. - A pleasure, Doctor. - The pleasure is mine. Elena is an endodontist. - Nice! - Yeah. I'm sure patients fake the symptoms just to get an appointment with you. I bet your patients feel in heaven when you dip your hands into them. Heaven must be a very noisy place because they never stop complaining. Excuse me, Docs. Just a sec. Chema… Elena! You're more beautiful than the one from Troy. My love! How have you been, my love? You tell me, darling. Better every time, just like wine. Thank you. How about you? I see you've been around. - Why? Oh… - What happened? That was Dr. García's wife. You know. - Don't be jealous of me, mademoiselle. - Give me a break, babe! Attention, docteur. So, how long has it been? A year. In Puerto Vallarta? - No, that was two years ago. - Really? - Last year was in Los Cabos. - Two years already? Yeah, right! Cabos! - Remember? - Unforgettable! You were awesome, mon chéri. - You went over the top, dear. - But not like you… Hi, can we join the fun? Of course. - Dr. Hugo Vera, Dr. Saúl Bravo… - Yeah. - We just met in the auditorium. - Of course. This is Dr. José María Gómez, also known as Chema. Nice to meet you. The pleasure is mine, colleagues. - At your service. - Thanks, I don't have a card. Come on! Is this your smile? Yeah. - That's original! - It's cool, huh? Yeah, if tacky is the new cool. My dear Chema here is our convention party expert. In all kinds of parties, actually… No, I'm no expert. Fun just comes to me and I'm just good at it. Like? Tonight we have a varied menu. - We start with the Ultra-Brite cocktail… - No, wait. Not the Ultra-Brite cocktail. - Magaña is going to be there. - Exactly. Oh, no… Magaña's there? No, I won't stand a bunch of old squares who only get excited by a whining dentist drill. - No, please! - No, we're not going. - So where do we go, then? - Where? So, Elena, why did you choose to be an endodontist? It's fascinating. It's all about killing pain. - But through pain. - Pain is subjective. Pain is just a symptom, it makes you conscious that something needs to be taken care of. Exactly. I kill the cause of the pain. You actually kill teeth, darling. No, dear. Quite the contrary, I actually save them. For Elena, the savior. - Cheers. - Cheers. FROM CONRADO SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT SO YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU WANTED TO SAY, TUSHY You know what? To us, dentists. - Hell, yeah! - Because we all need one. Cheers! I bet your dentist is cheaper than you are. Of course, man! The last time I went to see him he gave me Viagra before pulling out my molar. What? Why? To have something to hold on to. Come on… Wanna dance, mademoiselle? S'il vous plait. Mon cherie. Man, he just got ahead of you. You mean "us". Don't play dumb. I know your tricks. Less obvious than yours. Obvious but effective. Just watch and learn. Voicemail. The call will be charged at the end of the tone. Where are you, baby? Call me. - I love you, bye. - Hey, Elena. Let's hang just you and me. - Forget about these two. - Are you game for a massage? J'adore les massages. Let's go to my room. I have the master suite. That's so lame, Hugo. Come on! Do you know the Islands of Sian Ka'an, Elena? No, but I've heard of a famous Heaven Island. That's one of them. Breathtaking! My friend Eusebio lent me his house over there. Let's go. Seriously? No. Why? Don't you want to experience paradise? Wake up, girl. We're in paradise. I mean real paradise. You don't know what you're saying. She's here for the convention. - You have to experience it. - Hey, pit stop. I've got to pee. - Me too. - Me too. COME TO MY ROOM, TUSHY. I MISS YOU. OKAY, BE THERE IN 10. DON'T FALL ASLEEP. LOVE YOU Wow! Wow! No way! Elena! Come here. You've got to see this! - What? - Check this out, Elena! What? - Wow! - Look at this. So cool. Who'd write something like that? I don't know. God, maybe? What other sign do you need? - No, this is the one. - This is the one. - This is the one, man. - This is it. So timely. So, Elena? How about a massage? No, listen. - Think about it. - What? A lonely island. Okay. - Delicate sand, turquoise waters… - Okay. A healing place in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. It's paradise! Why go with those two when you have me? Okay, okay. Let's go to paradise. - Let's go. - You're not invited, man. - Why? - Such a pity. I would've loved to go with you to paradise. FROM CONRADO MY WIFE JUST DROPPED IN ON ME. SEE YOU TOMORROW. SORRY. Elena, hear me out. Let's go. You won't regret it. I swear. - Let's go to paradise. - Yeah, sure! - But only if Chema comes along. - Yes, fuck the convention! Yeah. You're going to miss me, man. - Aren't you coming? - I know you. Let's bring him. - Fuck it! Let's all go! - Yeah! - What's up, Canek! - Hello, sir. Welcome! Let me help you, sir. Be careful. Here you go. Oh, God. There we go. - Good morning. - Hello, sir. - Welcome, Miss. - Hi. Be careful. Thank you. - Gentleman. - Thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Saúl! The boss told me you were coming. - We got two rooms all set. - Perfect! What's up with the mane? I'll trim it when the boss returns. HEAVEN'S GATE Be careful. It's slippery here. Wow! Damn, look at this… - Amazing, Saúl. - Awesome. - Mon Dieu… - Well done, fucking Saúl. - Wow! - Awesome! Who is your friend? Colgate's owner? Shit, man. How many teeth does he cap in a day? He's not a dentist. He comes from a very rich family of politicians. - Figures, dude. - Rich and corrupt. Allegedly corrupt. - Isn't this proof? - Don't start, okay? C'est magnifique. But I need to crash. - Take a look at this beauty. - Where am I going to sleep? We have the master room for us. - Us? - Yes. What do you mean "us"? Do you mean Chema and I? - No, I meant… - Where's the room? Out and down to the left. - Saúl! - Have fun, guys. - Thank you. - Sleep well. Bisous… Rest up, colleagues! Hello? Hi, baby. What's up? Why didn't you pick up? Where are you? I'm in… Sorry I couldn't go with you, but I have a thousand things to do… Don't worry, dear. I'm here with Hugo, at Eusebio's place… Now I'm jealous, say hi to him. I'll tell h... Listen, I just got front row seats for Beyoncé to go with my ex-roomies. - Nice, baby! - Yeah, I'm so excited! I had to buy myself a Miu Miu, so gorgeous you wouldn't believe it. Now I need the proper purse, the shoes… - You have shoes… - Oh, I almost forgot! I called the Bishop and he's willing to give mass on our Anniversary Bash at the Country Club. We just have to make a small donation. Oh, my! Pris is crying. Got to go, baby. Call you later. Love you. I love you t... - What's up, dude. - Morning… Morning. There are swimsuits in the room. Really? Can I borrow one? - They're in the closet. - Cool. I'll grab one. Because wearing jeans in paradise is hell. - Did you sleep well? - Yeah. - Like a rock, man. - Is Elena up? She's in the bathroom. Where's Hugo? - Morning. - Morning. Anything you want to share, Chema? Like what? Well, was it good? What? What do you mean by that? - What, man? - You know what, man! - Don't play dumb. - Oh, yeah… Damn. Thanks for giving us the room. - It's amazing. - Come on, man! Did you bang her? Do you really want to know that? What kind of gentlemen are you? - Don't tell us, then. - Right. - No. - What? I want to know. Spill it. - Do you really want to know? - Absolutely. - The truth is… - Bonjour! - Bonjour! - Bonjour! Bonjour… - How did you sleep? - Good. - Coffee? - Please. - What's so funny? - Nothing. Come on, tell me. - What? - Chema… What's up? I just remembered our last night in Vallarta. Shit! I almost choked! Don't do that! That sure was a wild rum night. - What did you do? - You have no idea. Nothing really… Nothing? Your white butt shining under the bright full moon? - That's nothing? - Are we telling this? If mine is white, how's yours, Casper? See-through? A work of art under the moonlight. Remember Dr. Wong's face? Dr. Gerardo Wong? Jerry? He's a laugh. Yeah, you can't imagine what we did to him. Remember? Remember the ping-pong balls…? And maple syrup… Shit! What did you do to Jerry? You don't want to know. Don't tell them, please. - Don't tell them, please! - No, we can't tell. It's too personal, really. You're some nasty bastards. Oh, Elena… What am I going to do with you, Elena? Nothing, dude. Don't worry. By the way, how's Tamara? Super. She says hi. - Does she? - Yeah. - And the kids? - Awesome. Look. - How many do you have? - Two… - Tamara is gorgeous. - Let me see. - And your kids are adorable. - Wow. Look at how much Ricky's grown. She's your wife? - She's beautiful. - Dazzling. We'd make great friends. How long have you been together? Since the time you stole that gig from me with Urrutia. Shit, Urrutia! Really? You were going to work with Urrutia? It didn't actually happen thanks to Mr. I-lick-Urrutia's-balls here. Come on! You were never interested in research. Besides, you wanted to open your clinic in Santa Fé because money is the only thing on your mind, man. - Not true. - Yes, it is. - Of course not. - Of course, it is. Boring, guys. - Let's go to Heaven's Island, Saúl. - Hell, yeah. - Excuse me. - We'll leave in a moment. What a goddess… Look at that… - No… - Unbelievable… Oh, my god. See what you did? You scared away the only ass on the whole island. Stop it, dude. Have some respect. Respect? You're having breakfast in your underwear, man. To stay fresh, dude. You're moving too slow. Speed it up, or I might end up prescribing her to myself. What's wrong with you? If you two are so horny, why don't you just 69 each other? Or better yet, 70. And shove this. Too bad you have to go back to Magaña's talk later today. And I'm sure that Chema needs to go back to organize some bullshit. - I have to take this. - Cool. Go. Hello? Mom? Mommy dear? How's my queen? It's me, Hugo, your son, remember? You called me, Mom… I'm in the Mayan Riviera. I told you I was coming here. I miss you, Mommy. How are you? Yes, I know you don't like them. But you have to take them all, they're very important, Mom… No, I can't bathe you today, Mom. I'm far away. But that's what Rachel is for… Rachel, the nurse who's with you. Can I talk to her? Yes, Mommy. Yes, me too. Yes, Mommy. Take care, dear. Okay. Hello? Rachel? How are you? How's everything? That's great. I need a favor. Please don't let my Mom go downstairs to my clinic… No, even if she insists. She hasn't worked for me in ages. Okay… Also never leave her alone. It's very important, okay? Perfect. Anything you need, I'm here, okay? Yes, fine. See you soon. Bye. Doctors, I give you Heaven's Island. Le paradis, Saúl. Like a princess' little butt. Look at that. It can't be real. Chema! - Tie it to the palm tree. - Be careful. There you go. Here, I'll help you. - Good, man. - Perfect. - Need help? - No, I've got it. There we go. Let's go. Let's go. So beautiful. Your throne, my queen. Merci. Please, madame. Thanks, mon cherie. Hugo… beers, man. I promised you paradise, didn't I? Fantastic. It's amazing. Let's do a selfie. - Come here! - Coming, wait. Thank you. - Dr. Vera! - I'm here. One, two… cheese! Cheese! Let's do another one… Root canal! Why "root canal"? Cheers. Elena, there's a path to some mangroves over there… - Shit! - What? I forgot to send the file! No… There's no signal. There's no WiFi in paradise. That's why it's paradise. - We need to go back. - Wait. Come on. Give us a break. This was your plan. Yes, I know, sorry, guys. I really need to send this file. - It's urgent. Come on, let's go… - No, wait… We can't go. We just got here. Let's walk around and look for a signal. Last time I got a signal in that tower over there. Where? - Where the white flag is waving? - Yeah. What is that? An old bird watchtower. I'll come with you. I also need to make a phone call. Okay. Let's go. Here, grab this. - Thanks. Won't take long. - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Behave. And you, babe, relax… We're going to take it easy. Saúl… Saúl… Hey! Your throne, my king… What's up there? Anything worth it? Pissed on graffiti, rotten wood. Man… Maybe we should call it quits. It's obvious they've got something. You do that. I still have my ways. What about not covet thy neighbor's wife? Elena is single, what are you talking about? Think of your wife and kids. Don't do something stupid. Hey… What do you know, man? Easy, man. Don't get mad. It's just a tip. Take it or leave it. It's not my fault you're a bitter fucking loner. Maybe it is. Because I had a girlfriend who I loved, but you stole her from me and married her. I didn't steal her from you. You guys were a wreck. Of course not, man! - That's a goddamn lie! - You know it's not. You never had time for her. You were always busy with your shit. I spent all of my free time with her. What are you talking about? Yeah? Then why was she always crying on my shoulder? Because you couldn't stop flirting with her, man! No, Hugo. It was the other way around. She flirted with me. Also, don't be a child. Nobody steals a girl from anyone. Is that what all fucking girlfriend thieves think? Yeah, you know why? Girls have their own minds, their own hearts, and they make their own decisions. Live with it. Fuck that! We were supposed to be friends, man. And where were you? Stealing the Urrutia gig from me. You've got it all wrong. First, you stole Tam from me, then they gave me the job with Urrutia! - It was the other way around. - No, it was not. - Yes, it was, man. - No, it wasn't! No, it wasn't! So how are things going with your beau? - Not the way I hoped. - Why? We've been together for almost a year, but… - Do you have a signal? - No. There's got to be a signal somewhere. Do you know what I was thinking? That if life were perfect we would be a couple. Come on! Don't you think so? Chema, if life were perfect… Yes… we would have a signal here. I would have my own clinic and I would be living with my beau. But no. There's no signal. Merde! Relax, Smurfette. Just look at this. Don't just stand there. Help me, please. Anything? - I got it. - Where? Come. There's an antenna, so silly. Voilà! I got it. WHERE ARE YOU? I NEED THE FILE, IT'S URGENT STILL WAITING FOR THE FILE! I CAN'T GIVE MY TALK WITHOUT THE FILE ELENA! - Hello? - What's up, baby? - How are you? - I'm good. And you? Why don't you answer my calls? Hey, relax… Chill out, babe! What's wrong? I'm here. You're here now. But where were you last night? I'm sorry. I couldn't take your calls, I was busy. You knew I was going to have a crazy week. Crazy enough to cruise the bars looking for some action. Oh, please, not that again! Or on Grindr, looking for what you haven't lost. That's all in the past, Chema! Tell me how things are going. How's the convention? Okay, I guess. They're always the same crap. It won't attach the file. - What can I do? - Wait. Who is it? - What? - Who are you with? With Elena, the endodontist. My friend. I've told you about her, remember? Really? Are you banging broads now? Come on! Give me a break. - I never know with you. - You never know what? I never know if you're going to do the right thing. I asked you to stay, Chema. Our relationship's not on Nirvana right now, you know. I know. It's my job, you know? You know I had to come. - Of course I know. - It's been sent. I'm your husband, right? I just think it was the worst time for you to go. Hey, don't change the subject. Where were you last night? Come on! Picking cherries in the prairie at the sauna? Yeah, babe. I brought home a constructor, a charro, a soldier, an Aztec warrior, and a fucking cop, we put together our super Mexican version of The Village People and smeared pastry cream all over our naked bodies in a wild bareback orgy. Are you happy now? Yes, asshole. What's wrong with him? Everything's wrong with Omar. I think I've got to go back home. Let's go. I BROUGHT YOU HERE TO WORK. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? I still wonder how goddamn Magaña got the grounds for his treatment… You don't know his treatment, so you can't know if his grounds are the same. Man, he arrived at the same conclusions. They're not the same. Apparently, they're way better. Come on, man. If something is clear to me, that the only person with whom I shared the grounds of my treatment in Vallarta two years ago was you. What are you talking about? In the Yucatecan dinner we had. Don't play dumb. Yucatecan dinner? What Yucatecan dinner? Give me a break, man! You've got politician's memory now? You forget things? - You don't want to remember? - Wait a minute. You think I gave all your information to Magaña? You think that I betrayed you? You think that I'm that kind of a prick? You surprise me, Hugo. I mean, I don't think I know you anymore. You weren't like this. Don't play that cheesy card with me. I'm not your fucking wife. - All fingers are pointing at you. - That's what you need, man. A wife, man. Living with your mommy is turning you into a fucking Norman Bates. Shut up, asshole! Shut up! Maybe you just need to fuck her to get her out of your system! Don't mess with my mom, asshole! Shut the fuck up! Just be careful. Oedipus fucked his mommy and ended up blind, dickhead! - Let go of me! - You let go of me, fucker! Hey, stop it! Fight like a man, you cunt! Stop them! What's wrong with you? - Fucking faggot! - Let go of me! What the hell? Stop it! Enough! We can't leave you alone for a moment. - He started it! - No, you started it, asshole! Calm down! Let's pick up the stuff and leave. - Calm down! - What's wrong? I need to go back to the hotel, let's go. - No, why? - I also need to catch a plane. Hugo, don't you need to be at Magaña's talk? - Yes. - Cool it, the both of you. We're leaving. Let's go. Let's go! You didn't fuck her, asshole. - What is it? - What's wrong? I don't know. It just died… - Really? - Yeah, man. Now what? What should we do? - Shit. - What do we do? Let me… Harbor Master, Eclipse here. Do you copy? Over. Harbor Master, Eclipse here. Do you copy? Over. Speak clear, slow, and nice so they hear us and respond. Harbor Master, Eclipse here. Do you copy? Over. - No… - What's wrong? I don't get it. Why doesn't it work? Let's see… Who's got a cell? Mine has no coverage here. - I do. - Mine doesn't either. - Shit! Mine's out of battery. - I've got a signal. Can I? Sorry, the number that you've dialed is not… Try another number. Sorry, the number that you've dialed is not… - Let me try. - No… Fuck. - What if we pump it for gas? - But if the engine is drowned. That's it! Sorry, the number that you have dialed - is not available. - We're fucked. Maybe the engine needs to rest. That might help. LEAVE MY HUSBAND ALONE, BITCH! What's wrong? I can't make a call, but I do receive messages. I mean… Please, Saúl, get me out of here. I really need to be back in the convention. - It's urgent, man. - Hey… You're going back, okay? I promise. Just calm down. It's not the end of the world. Are you okay? Let me check the engine. If you know what you're doing… I do. What do you know about boats? Not much, but they can't be that different from motorcycles. Do you know about motorcycles? Fuck, man. Just because I'm gay you think that I know nothing about engines? - You're gay? - You're gay? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, he's gay. So what? - Anything wrong with that? - No. No, nothing. Is there a toolkit? Please. I didn't find the toolkit, but… What did you find? - This. - Awesome. Perfect. Sorry. - What's wrong with you? - Is there another cartridge? - No, man. - Thank you, fucking awesome. - Congratulations, Saúl! - It was an accident. This looks like a funeral. If I'm going to die, I'm leaving smiling and happy. - A beer anyone? - Me. Okay. Man, we're in the middle of fucking nowhere, no communication, it's getting fucking late, and you want to hit the bottle? What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? To the bad weather, a good face. What else should we do? I need to be back at the convention! I need to be there! Hugo, that's not going to be possible anymore. - Why not! - Listen! It's getting dark. We can't sail at night on shallow waters. Got it? Okay, I get it. What are we going to do? - We can't just drift here. - Do something, please! Okay. Here… Okay. S.O.S. Eclipse to Harbor Master. Over. Repeating, S.O.S. Eclipse to Harbor Master. Over. Don't get down, don't get sad, nothing but joy here 'cause it's time for the Reggaeton hour with your friend here Willy Carvajal… - No! - Hey! Get me out, please! Please get me out of here! - Calm down, Elena! - Get me out of here, please! - No! - Elena, come, come. Sit, sit down. Listen to me. No… Everything's going to be okay. Breathe. I'm going to get you out of here. I promise, okay? - Calm down, hold on a second. - Breathe. Easy, take a breath. - That's it! - Hell yeah! Mon amour! Fuck yeah! Now you can pass me a beer! Chin-chin! Par Saúl, mon héros! Yeah, cheers! - You're a genius, man! - Now we can celebrate! Hell yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Sit down, guys! Cheers! Really? They are exactly the same grounds… It's preposterous. I don't know how, but Dr. Magaña stole my whole treatment. He wants to sue me? Fuck, man… Aren't there any ethics left in this world? Of course, I'll counter sue. Evidence will come out, don't worry. I really appreciate it, Yáñez. Thanks, buddy. Bye. It's the same treatment, man. Just without any consideration for the patient, obviously. Stop suffering, man. You know what they say. Pain is unavoidable. Suffering is optional. Here. DINNER? You sound like a goddamn hippie T-shirt. YOUR WIFE ALREADY KNOWS. Here, this will chill you out. Merci. Are you in trouble because you didn't make it to Barona's talk? I'm very sorry, but I did everything possible. - There was nothing else I could do. - Mais oui. Don't worry. It's okay. If worse comes to worst, I'll give you a job at my clinic, okay? Thanks, but it won't be necessary. Cheers. Cheers. You're all set, baby. Yeah. Anything you need, just call me, okay? Well, that's Chema for you, my Tats. Have fun and may the Force be with you. Okay, kisses. Hey… Your corrupt friend's sommelier is the shit, man. The best. Sir, dinner is ready. Thanks, Canek. I won't take long. See you there. - Shall we? - Yeah. - Hey, babe, what's up? - Where have you been, Chema? You don't answer your cellphone. They can't find you at your hotel. Where the hell are you? I came to an island with some colleagues. An island? What are you talking about? Who are you with? With some dentists. They lent an amazing house to one of them. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's paradise. Paradise for a dental orgy? Who are you banging, bitch? Nobody, Omar. - Sorry. - What's wrong? Jeez. Is that why you called? I just miss you. When are you coming back? I wanted to leave today, but I got stranded. I'll leave tomorrow as soon as I can. Do you have anything else to do at the convention? Yeah, some. There are some important talks, the closing ceremony, meetings. The usual. What? Now you don't get me? Of course, I do. We've lived together for the last 12 years. I paid for your dental studies, for your clinic, you pretty much owe me your career. Of course, I get it. I know perfectly well what you've done for me and you don't need to remind me every single day. Do I still shove in your face the fact that you used to pay that greaser to fuck you? Don't twist things around, bitch. Do you want me to pay him now, you fag? - Because now you're the one who's broke? - Don't talk to me like that! Go fuck yourself! You were nothing! - I made you, fucking shitty hustler! - You can't… Look, Omar, I don't… I just want to say that I don't need to pay any greaser to fuck me. I've already paid you for that! Canek, when you finish picking up you can go and get some rest. That will be all for tonight. Thank you. - Have a good night. - You're welcome, sir. Very kind of you. Thanks, Canek. - Take it easy, guys. - Good night, Canek. Good night. DON'T WORRY ABOUT MY WIFE. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO MY TALK? I NEED TO SEE YOU. Do you want to go see the stars? Sure. Am I not invited? Afraid not, dude. Son of a bitch. Did you notice how he manipulated everything to win Elena over? What do you mean? Did you believe all that bullshit on the boat? - What bullshit? - Think about it. The boat breaks down out of the blue, the radio doesn't work, you can't fix the boat, but he magically does fix it out of nowhere and saves our lives. Isn't it suspicious? You're being too paranoid, man. I don't think so. Of course, you are. I don't know what the problem is between you two, but this guy has only been cool, - generous, and kind to us. - Yes. - Yes, but… - He got Elena and you didn't. That's what's nagging you. Take it like a man and relax, dude. I'm serious, Elena. - What? - You put a spell on me. Careful with my spells. They usually end poorly. - Do you know why? - Why? Because you're not careful when you cast them. - Is that so? - Yeah. - You know what I also think? - What? That you haven't chosen the right person. And who would that be? Someone who cares for you. Noté. Someone who loves you for your inner beauty. Noté. Someone who loves you and makes you feel loved. Oh, my. Mon Dieu, Saúl. Careful. If you keep talking like that I'm going to have to spank you. I love it. Why don't you? Yeah? Do you want me to be mean to you? Try me, let's see what happens. Do you want to be worn and torn? If that's the price I have to pay. Are you a religious man? Yes. Why? Have you ever cheated on your wife? Never. - Do you love her? - With my life. Then why do you want to fuck me? - To feel alive again, I guess. - Why? Do you feel dead? Well, Tam and I haven't done it since she got pregnant with Ricky. - Hey… - What? Can you tell your lips to be quiet? Why? Because they're asking me to kiss you. Why don't you? Hey, looking for something? A deck of cards or something. Not here. There… Wait. Forget the cards. There's Monopoly. - I love Monopoly, yeah! - No, wait. That game lasts about 800 hours. - Come on, Elena, let's go! - Just a quick game. Do you want to play, Chema? - Come. - Sure. Why don't we play a couple rounds of poker and call it a night? Come on, Saúl. Let's play. I can't stand that game. It's just a game to kill some time. And I have the secret weapon, sponsored by the Tooth Fairy. - No! - Monopoly and a joint? I haven't done that in ages. A toke's what I need to level my stress. Hey, you can't get high here, man. What's wrong with you? Chill out, dude. We're only medicating like gringos. Eusebio does not allow drug use in his house. Unless he supplies them… Then stop drinking, man. That's totally different. No, it's not. That's also a drug. As well as sugar, coffee, chocolate, even the air you're breathing. - Here. - I'm not smoking that shit. There are wars because of it. Your call. Though this is actually a present from Dr. Rivera directly from Los Angeles. Five-star Tuluminatti Kush, dude. Come on, Saúl. Don't be so boring. I'm not boring. Monopoly is boring. - Stoners are boring. - I see. Why don't you contemplate for a while what it is that you like about me, then? Yeah, good idea. - Don't leave, Saúl! - No! You love money. You can be the bank. What? Hello? Accountant, good evening. What's so urgent? Overdrawn again? All my cards? It can't be true… Please payout of the clinic's account, what am I going to do? If it's not enough… pay something at least, anything. Yes, I also hope it won't happen again… Thank you, bye. - Tell me you don't want it. - It's amazing. - Where did you get it? - Fucking awesome. Goddam hard to find. It's such a classic. Look at this… Game over or what? Chema bought the Skangen-Varden 3000. Beautiful. It's beyond awesome. So what? I have the 4000. Yeah, but everybody knows that the 3000 is the Rolls Royce of dental chairs. Give me a break! It's so cool that if I don't have a patient I usually take naps on it. Did you know a dentist invented the electric chair? Let's go, Elena. No, we just started. My turn. Who invented it? - What? - The electric chair. Hello? Hi, Tammy. How are you, babe? - Hi, baby. - Listen, love. I just called the account… Did you say hi to Hugo for me? Are you guys getting along? Super, honey. So, the accountant just... I had the best day ever with the kids. We went to the Toy Fair and I got Pris the most beautiful dollhouse. It's huge! I mean, we could actually live in it. Listen, love… I also promised her a pony for her birthday. Don't you love it? And I got Ricky an amazing Power Wheels… But he's only one year old! But he'll grow, baby! - Listen, Gus came with the best idea - Honey, let me speak! For our Anniversary Bash. He is friends with Luismi and says he can get him for us at a great price. I love it! PREGNANCY TEST Excusez-moi, monsieur, est-ce que ce bus traverse les Champs Élisiens? Quoi? A quelle heure ouvre le banque? Bank? You need money? Allons-nous au cirque? I need to tell you something. Shoot. Amalgama. What? A-mal-ga-ma. Wow. I never noticed before how beautiful it sounds. - It does. - Yeah. Amalgama… Amalgame… Amalgam… No, it sounds better in Spanish. - Amalgama. - Yeah, I know. - That's what we are. - What? The perfect mix… The things you say, Hugo. You're a shining star, I'm a lonely planet. That's cute. I can't resist your gravitational force. Man, stop it before I explode. Our unavoidable collision will create a brand new Big Bang. Are you married, Hugo? No, never. - And you? - No. I don't believe in marriage. Perfect. Let's collide… What? - Come on, Hugo. - What? Dr. Jiménez told me you banged her with the same speech. Amalgama-Big Bang. - She told you? - Yeah. But we can be friends. Friends? - Yeah… - I have 4,635 friends. That's a lot. - I'm sorry. - Why? Chema… Hugo has over 4,000 friends on Facebook. And do you know any of them? Some, yeah. This guy needs a big hug. A hug. - Badly… - What? - Dr. Vera needs a hug. - No, wait. What are you talking about? What is this? - No, wait… - Oh, yeah! Stop it… Shit. It wasn't me. - Me neither. - Not I. What the hell happened? That was blown glass from Tlaquepaque. - Merde! Sorry. It was an accident. - Sorry, Saúl. We were dancing… Yeah, it was… We'll replace it. Where's the broom? I'll clean it up. In the kitchen. Where else? Sorry. 505. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE, TUSHY. Chema! - Chema! - What? You have a video call from Omar. I want to meet your husband. - Yeah, introduce us. - I'll take it! Wait. - Hi, love… - Hi! What's up? You wanted a greaser to fuck me? Meet Joshua Why did you make me do this? Why? I love you! I'll love you forever, Chema, you fuck… That was the husband? Son of a bitch. How could he do that? Why? On our bed. Fucking cheating bastard. Fucking asshole. I hate the motherfucker. Everything's going to be okay, dear. You'll see. I know that this is cliché, but everything happens for a reason. Right now this is so painful that you can't see ahead. But you have to move on. I can't. I can't. This has to stop. Pain becomes a habit if you let it. I just… I don't even know how to live without him. I don't. Well, you'll have to start. And what am I going to do? Get up… and keep on living. How? - I don't know. - How? Just let it flow. Fuck, man! Can you imagine someone doing that to you? Yeah, fucking awful, man. Here… I can't go on like this, Hugo. I can't take it any longer. What? Look… I told Father Hilario during confession and he suggested that I talk to you. - About what? - Don't think bad of me. It was completely unintentional and out of my control. What? What is it? Well… it might have been me. It might have been you, what? Maybe I might have said something. What are you talking about? I was shit-faced drunk at the Puerto Vallarta convention, man… When? At the Ultra-Brite cocktail, just after you left. And? And my mouth got loose. As always. Hugo, I was just boasting about you. About all of your accomplishments. What are you talking about? I don't get it. Look. I know it was a terrible mistake. What, man? I think I gave Magaña the grounds for your treatment. No. Fuck, man. I fucking knew it! You're a fucking liar! I told you on Heaven Island and you denied it, fucker! - It wasn't the right time. - And now it is, you prick? - Why did you do it? - I swear I didn't mean to, man. - I didn't mean to. - But you did! - It just slipped, man! - Why? I'm sorry, man! Sometimes shit just happens! I can't believe it. You're supposed to be my friend. And I am, Hugo. Oh, yeah? Well, I also need to tell you something, friend… What? Two years ago… During the same congress in Vallarta… Yeah… After I left you totally wasted at the Ultra-Brite cocktail… Yeah… I had a revival with Tamara. A what? I did her, man. What? Well… What you just heard. I fucked your wife. Why? Why? Because we were also wasted. But why? Because I wanted to. Why? Because she also wanted to, man. Because shit just happens. I'm sorry, man. Do you hear that? What? That… What? No way. Yeah. Right there. - Like this? - Yes… Yeah! Oui… No… Hey! Open the goddamn door! - Open up, or I'll knock it down! - Come on, man! Let them be. What did we just do? I don't know. What are you going to do with that? Saúl! - What's up? - What's up? Easy, man… What the hell is wrong with you two? What didn't have to happen happened. That's life. One thing led to another… Wait… Why the hell am I giving you explanations? No, wait. Aren't you gay, man? Yeah, so? So, what are you? A closeted hetero? - It's not what it seems, Saúl. - Yes, it is. And you can bang the whole world if you want. But not on your host's bed. Is that what bothers you? Come on. - Damn perverts. - What's wrong with you, Saúl? With me? Nothing. What the hell is wrong with all of you, doctors? - What? - What have we done to you? Leave them alone. This is about me. Hey, Saúl. We're all friends, right? Friends? Do friends use condoms when they hump each other? Mind your own business. It's going to be Chema's business if she blames her pregnancy on him. - What do you mean? - Elena here. She brought a pregnancy test, didn't you, dear? You looked through my stuff? Not precisely. But why haven't you used it? - Give her a break. - What do you want, Saúl? I just want to help. HURRY, TUSHY THE HOT TUB IS READY. LET'S MAKE WAVES. Okay. He's right. I need to know. Are you sure? Yes. You don't have to do anything you don't want. Elena… That was crazy, Saúl. You're not like this. - Shut up, man. - Show some respect. You don't have to be mean. Especially not to a woman. - Shut the fuck up. - Can't you just be a friend? A friend? You fucked my wife, pal! What's wrong man? Sorry, man. I told you to shut up. Look what you've made me do. Look what you did to me! - Shit, man. - Chill out. You'll just have to change your business card. Fuck you! Don't worry. You can apply your own treatment. Or better yet, Magaña's. They say it's faster. Fuck you! Let's put some ice on that, dude. What's wrong with you? The motherfucker broke my tooth! Chema, help me close the doors, please. - Put on plenty of ice, dude. - Yeah, man. Let me see. Okay. You're blowing this out of proportion, Saúl. Tam was thinking of you while we did it. - She kept calling me "baby". - Hush, man. Don't make things worse, okay? Pass it. Please, Saúl. Give it to me. Hello? Hello? Sorry, I can't hear you… No, I'm not Dr. Vera. He's busy right now. Who is it? Do you want to leave a message? Give me my phone, asshole! - Give him his phone, man. - Sorry, can you repeat that? Yeah… I get it, it's urgent. I'll let him know. - Who was it? - Give him his phone. - Who was it, goddamn it? - I'll tell you later. Tell me, asshole! It's an emergency! - Tell him, man. - It was Magaña. He wanted to know why you stole his treatment. Fuck you, man! Who was it? Hey. Respect, man. Don't talk to me like that, okay? Fuck you! Enough! Both of you! Calm down. What's going on? What happened to you, Hugo? He needed an aesthetic reconstruction job done, right, Hugo? - Stop it! - Give me back my fucking phone! So, Elena? Good news or bad news? Positive or negative? Stop it, Saúl. Do you know who the father is? - You don't have to tell us. - He's right. You don't have to. I'm just asking. It's… It's… My boss. Conrado Barona? But he's married, right? With a gorgeous woman. They've been together for ages. Would you leave your wife, man? Fuck, no. We have children. Barona has four. And they say the wife is a peach. - Jeez, that's enough, guys - Who'd leave a woman like that? No one, dude. Shit, guys. Stop it. It's fucked up. Poor Elena. Elena… I'm sorry. Come, sit down. Quiet down. Think about the baby. What baby? I don't know if I want it. I don't know what to do. Forgive us, Elena, please. We didn't mean to hurt you. Elena, please forgive me. - You really fucked up. - I know. I'm really sorry. Here, man. Who called me? Rachel. What did she want? You should call her. It's urgent. Why? What happened? Your mom is missing. What? Yeah, she escaped when Rachel went to the bathroom. Fuck, man! Hugo, I get that you're worried, she's your mom. But she's castrated you all your life. Don't mess with her. Man, she dressed you like a doll when you were a kid… Really? That makes two of us. She made you go to the dental lab with her. I mean, she made you study dentistry because it was her dream, she even made you use her as your assistant. - Stop it, man! - I wouldn't be surprised if she's using her illness to keep her grip on your balls, man. Shut up! Have you noticed that every time you leave, - something happens to her? - Shut the fuck up! Dude, I'm just saying that she's the reason why you'll never have a healthy relationship with women. - Sorry. - I said shut the fuck up! Man… What the fuck, man? Shit! Cool it, man! Look what you made me do! That hurt, you idiot! Good. I'm glad. - You pair of fucking psychos. - You deserve it. Now we're even. - What's wrong with you? - Are you okay, Saúl? Seriously, stop your shit. A tooth for a tooth, and the world will end up toothless. Yes, you're behaving like kids. Come on, kids? Kids are wise compared to these assholes. Fuck. The call's not going through. Good. That way your mom won't be able to manipulate you. The way you manipulated us all on the boat? - What? - Don't play dumb. I did nothing. Of course, you did! I know you. I'm not as stupid as you think. Oh, yeah? Thanks. So, according to you, what did I do? I have no fucking idea, but you made the boat fail and stop. Why would he do that? So you wouldn't leave, Elena. So I wouldn't go to Magaña's talk. You were just collateral damage, Chema. Fuck… - Is that true, Saúl? - Of course not. He's hallucinating. I'm not hallucinating. LOVE YOU. I NEED YOUR PUSSY. See, Elena? You're like a creep magnet. Like these two. Look who's talking. What do you mean? That is the reason why your relationships never last. No, I'm just unlucky when it comes to love. It has nothing to do with luck. Then what? You let yourself be used and dumped. What? You treat yourself like a goddamn piece of shit. Oh, sorry. Fuck! - Why did you do that? - It just slipped. Grow up, Elena! Come on, Chema! You grow up. Please, I feel like the Dalai Lama among you guys. Don't give me that crap, dear. Then stop depending on your sugar daddy, who's always treated you worse than shit, by the way. Yeah, why did he make that video call? Yeah, you should've recorded it and uploaded it to all social media. That'd teach him a lesson. What the fuck do you know? I'm with Omar because I love him. No, Chema. You're still with him because you don't dare to be on your own. To be free. It has nothing to do with love. Grow up. Let's see. If I do something about my problem, would you too? What? With Omar? Yes. Fuck it. Okay. I QUIT. STOP HARASSING ME. I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. Done, but there's no signal… The message will leave when it's back. I'm going to block his number too. There. Your turn. What are you doing? I'm going to send him a video. Omar… we can't be together anymore. We both know it. We've hurt each other a lot. Let's stop pretending, man. Our relationship ended a long time ago. This is the last time that you'll see me. Goodbye. Done? Did you send it? Yeah. There's no signal, but it'll leave when it comes back. We did it. Yes. That's exactly what you need to do, man. You want me to split up with Tamara? You want her back? Of course not. The last thing I want is a woman grabbing me by the balls. Right, you already have your mommy. And they are my balls and she's my wife. Don't go there, man. I'm not going there. I know her. No, you don't. She's changed a lot. She's changed nothing. She squeezes every cent out of you. You indulge her every whim. You don't have the balls to set limits with her. Oh, yeah? Why don't you teach me how, since you know her so well? - That's not the point. - You're an expert in everything. Fucking Mr. Know-it-all. The good kid delivering straight A's to mommy just to make her proud. It's all coming out. What? What's coming out? You're jealous. Jealous? Of you? - You bet. - Jealous of what? Of my professional success, of watching me give TV interviews, of reading my essays and seeing my face on dentist journals… No, you're still hallucinating. I'm not your mom. I've never cared about that. My only dream has always been my family. Something that you'll never have, Hugo. Are you sure? Of course, I'm sure. - Absolutely positive? - Absolutely. Have you ever wondered why little Ricky looks so much like me? Well… I might have a family after all. There's no way he's your son. How can you be so sure? Because Ricky is my little baby. He took his first steps walking to me. His first word was "dad." He giggles every time he sees me. He can't be yours. Did you use a condom, Hugo? Of course, he's your child, Saúl. Just wait until he grows all his teeth. I'm sure he'll get my perfect smile. You're a piece of shit. Do not ever mess with my family again. Only if you don't mess with mine. - I have to do something with Tamara. - Obviously. If they did it, why can't we? Cause you don't have the balls. Yeah, you're taking too long. Okay, Hugo. I'll call Tam, you call your mom. But even if I call her… No, it's very different. The only problem I have with my mom is that she's missing and I can't contact the person taking care of her. That's all. Come on, man. Stop the bullshit! What bullshit? Do what you want then. Tammy… I'm sending you this voice message to tell you that… we can't keep on spending like this. We're getting into serious financial problems. So… You'll have to return the first row tickets for Beyoncé, the Miu Miu, forget the purse and the shoes, return Pris' doll mansion, and don't promise her a pony, I'm not Bill Gates… Also, return Ricky's Power Wheels, he doesn't need it. And let's make a more discreet Anniversary Bash. That means no Country Club, no Bishop, and no Luismi, okay? Hugo told me about Puerto Vallarta. We have to talk. Things can't be the same anymore. Kisses, Tam. The signal is back. Fuck, the message was sent. Mine also left. So did mine. Hello? Hello? Rachel… are you with my mother? What? I can't hear you. Don't hang up. Say that again… What? I can't hear you! Again, please… Rachel… You found her at the park… Can I talk to her? Mom! Mommy, dear. How's my darling queen? Of course, you're cold. You went to the park without a sweater, Mommy… What? Hello? Mommy? Mommy… What do you want? She's my mother. And a mother… we only have one. But cut the cord, man… And find a girlfriend. That's true. If you want to fool yourself, it's your problem, dude. Okay, guys. Are we friends again? Nope. He's a total prick. And you're a total asshole. Why don't you do like I said, 69 each other and fix all your issues? S'il vous plaît. That would do you so much good. Hey… Man, I'm going to report Magaña tomorrow. I owe it to you. It's the least I can do for you. Thanks, man. I'm sure it meant nothing to Tam. You guys are the shit. Like Popo and Iztla. No, like John and Yoko. Actually, more like Beauty and the Beast. Come on, man! - I really like seeing you very little. - Yeah, me too. - Fuck you, man. - Fuck you, man. Colleagues and now friends… To cavities, which give our lives purpose. - Cheers. - Cheers. Damn it… Fuck it, I won't pick up. What time is the closing ceremony? At noon. In the main auditorium. Okay. Let's go. - Ready, guys? - Let's go. Shit, I'm fried… Back to reality. - Shit. Again? Give me a break. - No. - No, it can't be. - Oh, fuck. - It'll start… - When? - Get us out of here, please! - I'm trying. Relax. Chema, do something. - What do you want me to do? - Something. - Did you mess up the boat again? - Not this time. What do you mean "not this time"? Jeez!
