Greed, hatred, and delusion are the three basic root causes of suffering in human life. Greed is the leading cause because greed is an inherent part of human nature. You should be happy with what you already have. Otherwise, the greed would manipulate you into doing all the bad things with no way out. Your boundless beneficence. You forgot something, didn't you? - Forgot what? - Forgot to pay for the incenses. Which ones? $6. $6 for three sticks? $6 dollars per stick, so $18 in total. Are you a robber or something? How dare you call me a robber? I'm a decent salesman. I already knew that, but can I get a discount, please? How much you got? That's all. I didn't expect to spend more money in the pagoda. Take it off! I'm begging you. I spent over $200 on this watch. Discount! I can buy it with $50. How about $150? A second-hand watch! $50 only! Can I redeem my watch as soon as I have enough money? Don't move! Police! Police! Turn around! You're lucky, man. This is an extremely dangerous criminal who has been tricking people out of valuable items. Hand me that watch. Anything else in your belt bag? Some personal stuff. Hand me that bag too. Good. Caught you red-handed, the evidence is here too. It's time to come the police station. Why am I being arrested? I'm a victim. The victim's testimony is required for investigation. Huh? Okay, sure. You can go. What are you looking at? Okay, okay. Thank you. Hold on. You wait for a call from the station. Then remember to show up to retrieve the evidence, okay? Okay, okay. Stand still! Okay, cheers! Two, three, cheers! Here is your share. What is it? Only $50? Do me a favor this time, I'm badly in debt. We're knight errants, it's common to be in debt. How much is your debt anyway? Over 50 grand. You keep doing theses small tasks for $50 to $100 each, how long until you pay off your debt? Conning rich people will make more money. Right? It will be no picnic, dude. Bro, it's not my fault, it's hers. Bitch! You ruined my hair. This is the place we're drinking, not the place for your business. I will fucking kill you. That's not her intention. You know how much this T-shirt costs, asshole? You can't beat him. How insolent! Take it easy, bro. Your hair still looks good. Get off of me! - Calm down. - Have a seat. Have a seat, please. Come on. I'll have my staff clean this mess up now. Bring us a hotpot. - Okay, right away. - Hey. Take it and you can go home early. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. You gave away $20? Now I understand why you're badly in debt. They deserve to be helped. Keep doing good things, luck will come to you. How fast that luck comes! Well, c'est la vie, you… - This 89 eating house is really good. - Yes, sir. Turn around and get out of here now. Son of a bitch! You're fucking me, right? - Take it easy, man. - Get out of here and play with me. Can we do that here? Are you challenging me? Challenge me! Guys, go! Jinx! Go find somewhere else then. I'm sorry! You motherfucker… Those motherfuckers cheated me! - Get them! - Run! - Stop! - Stop, motherfuckers! Stop right now! Split up! Run at your own pace! Wait for me! So fast! Stop there! How dare you scam me? Scammer. Scammer. - I will return your money. - No need. Scam me? Scam me? Wanna scam? - Where is the other guy? - Can't find him, sir. Fuck! Drag him along! Find the other one. Messing with me was that prick's biggest mistake. SMOKING IS EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO HEALTH PARADISE ISLAND AN EDEN FOR THE ELITES You have to pay $10 for this 50-cent balut because you're sitting in a luxury villa inside a 5-star resort. More importantly, using Furstenberg tableware to enjoy it. It was rumored on the internet that you always seduce chicks. Have you seen any chicks around me carrying bags worth thousands of dollars? Drive million-dollar cars, build multimillion-dollar villas? I don't like seducing chicks. I like seducing lads. You're funny. It would be our honor to have you, a million-dollar designer, as a strategic partner. I always consider three things before making the final decision. Knowledge. Experience. Enjoyment. I understand. What should I do now to win your trust? Knowledge, I already had it. Experience from small companies like yours, I had them too. The enjoyment with you… that's what I haven't had yet. Should I say yes swiftly, you may think I'm a docile and dissolute guy. Am I right? You're wrong! Your open-mindedness does not unveil the thing deep inside you. Here. This Rolex GMT-Master 2 costs around 15 grand. Ironically, if people see this watch on my wrist, they would think it's a fake one. 'Cause it does not suit me. Oh. What are you doing? To let you know that you deserve more than this watch. Thai. I think we need more time for this. Can we slow down? Don't you have a timekeeping device on your wrist now? Tonight I'm a top, you're a bottom. And tomorrow? I will be your strategic partner. Get your kit off, except the watch. Pretty sexy that way. Wanna be stimulated? Let me. You naughty boy. We shouldn't skip the foreplay anyway. Come on, babe. That must be interesting. Hold on. Why rush it? Who is this guy? - My partner. - Partner on the bed? Strategic partner. - Who is this? - Long-term partner. Betrayer. - Tu, will you please help me explain this? - You honeydicked me. I find no reasons to cooperate with you. - Tu! - Tell me, how many partners do you have? You pervert! I'm also your partner. Why don't you bang me instead? Strategic partner. Strategic partner. Strategic partner. Stop being weird, you prick. We don't wanna attract the attention. I'm so excited, that watch is a bargain indeed. At least 15 grand. You got all the luck, man. Thanks to your neglect. How late for work were you? It was not my fault. Just noticed that I had forgotten the key when we were there. You idiot! Cash. As usual. Okay, "get" go. You must be really tired after a 22-hour flight, aren't you? Well, yep. I still feel a bit jet-lagged now. Couldn't even take a nap. I'm so sorry to hear that. Listen up. I have a secret and I was wondering if you would like to hear it? What is your secret? I'm the best at inducing sleep. Oh, I just thought you're good at awakening people, aren't you? Hello, sir and madam, this is a 1998 Grand Vin de Chateau Latour wine. You're a lovely couple. Enjoy your meal. Thank you very much. Is he speaking in French? Yes, he is. I'm a Vietnamese American. I can speak seven foreign languages including American, if you need. Please speak Vietnamese. My boss asked me to bring Mr. Tu this bottle of wine. May I know why? My boss owes much to Mr. Tu. This restaurant wouldn't exist without Mr. Tu. You're flattering me. Please give Mr. Hung my regards. Do you want to share with me what you have done to help the owner of this restaurant? Not a big deal at all. Mr. Hung is Vietnamese French. He was tricked into buying non-residential lot when he just returned to Vietnam. Then he asked me to help him out. I introduced him to another lot. It was pretty good, affordable. Much more room for sustainable growth. Actually, we're sitting on that place. All right, listen up. I was about to invest in land here, honestly. Didn't expect to see an expert like you here. What would they call this circumstance? Oh, my God! Tu, someone fainted over there. Someone fainted. What's happening? Back off, back off. - What happened? - I'm starved. Can anyone give me some food? Yeah, I have food. Please take this lobster. Here. - Thank you. - Stop! That lobster would kill him instantly. Oh, dear. My lobster… I have seen this before. Starvation must be the cause. He's right. I'm starved. It will move to a colon spasm in less than five minutes. He looks fine, right? Seriously? Is he acting? Why do the spasm take so long? - Hey, it's not happened yet. - He's acting, I guess. I got a gut ache! Then my diagnosis is accurate. Everyone, back off. Give him some space to breathe. Are you okay? Hypoglycemia is the next symptom, in addition to cramps in his upper body. Hypoglycemia? What is hypoglycemia? Everyone, calm down. It's also a symptom of tetanus. He looks like a zombie, don't you think? One of his legs will raise. And then both legs. What? How strange. How strange. This is it. He'll run on empty very quickly. Take him to the hospital now. Let's go. Take him to the hospital! Tu, you call an ambulance. Too late, I will drive him to the hospital. No need to go to the hospital, just give me food, please. Hold on, Tu. Here. Take it to pay for the hospital. You're so kind. I gotta go. See you around. You acted too fast for me to stop back then. I truly got hypoglycemia. I just needed food. You can give me the $250 that that lady gave you. I'll go buy food myself. Lucky for you, I'm a doctor. I already examined you, so don't worry. You don't have any symptoms. Hey, bro. My blood sugar level is low indeed. Hypoglycemia usually causes shakiness, generalized hyperhidrosis. Yes, it's right. Your body, on the other hand, is hecking dry. Heartbeat may be very fast too. You had spasms, but the heartbeat was very stable. Not too slow, not too fast. And finally, Hypoglycemia will cause temporary visual impairment. How do you know Ms. Trang gave me $250? To sum up, you're not a patient. You're… the… con… artist. Are you a doctor or the police? Of course I'm a doctor. And we're on the way to the police station. Holy shit. I swear I'm not a bad person. I'm dead broke so I just wanna look for a free meal. This is an island where decent and upstanding people live. You're not allowed to smear it. I will do whatever you want me to do. Please don't drive me to the police station. How much money do you have in your pocket? Around $100. This is the earliest flight to Saigon. Window seat, lunch included. You're really going this far? I wanna ensure you won't be cheating anyone out of anything. This is the best way. If you used all my money for a plane ticket, then how will I survive in Saigon? My boy! On the plane or in prison? You pick. Godspeed. Hey, babe. Hey, tanned. What is that? Hi. My name is Thai. Are you acquainted with Tu? - You meant Dr. Tu? - Nope. Director Tu. A director of a construction firm. Director of a construction firm? Ah, he's my cousin. Tu shared a confidence with me. He said that he had a crush on a designer and that the guy would be his dream boy. He intended to take this cooperation opportunity to declare his feelings for you. Notwithstanding, you'll only looked for a fling eventually. So what's next? I... I gotta go back downtown. - Or… - I'm quite busy, so I do hope you understand. It's not my place to interfere in his affairs anyway. But the truth is he's my cousin so, I'm counting on you. You will get everything you want if you persuade Tu to forgive me. To do that, we need time, and your investment. Take care, my brother-in-law. I will write a poem for you. You can count on me. My name is Tu. What's your name? I'm Thu Cuc. But, don't even think about hitting on me. Just because I don't like a cub. That's not what I meant really. I was passing by and saw a strawberry quartz on your wrist. Your countenance tells me that you were born in the Bing-Yin Tiger year. Oven fire element. Today is a bad day for a Bing-Yin Tiger horoscope. You should beware of water. I don't think I will swim in the pool tonight. Neither go to the beach. Sorry for disappointing you. Let's see how to properly jump into the pool. He jumped into the pool! I'm so sorry. Man proposes… God disposes. Your Yin Tang acupuncture is kinda dark. The Property Palace in the palm of your hand is slightly sunken. I'm afraid you would have a misfortune regarding the Property Palace in the next few days. However, you won't believe in what I said anyway. So I'll let you enjoy your drink alone. Bait taken. You're too young to have that vast knowledge of feng shui. I did intend to invest in real estate here. I'm having a problem right now. Do you have a solution for this? Not hard anymore, if you have me here. Do you know 90% of our Feng Shui clients are property investors? - I have a lot… - Hello? Tu. Your brother is here. Tu! Someone call the security guard! Do you know how difficult it was to look for you? You left me alone all the time. Who is he, Tu? He is my brother, do not make him yours. Please don't take him from me. What is it? I suppose you should take care of him first. Ah. We can discuss our business later. - Cuc. - You're too bad. You locked me up for three days, starved me. - I'm starved. - Look at him! Yummy, yummy. Tu! How can you treat your brother like that? Guys, this man might have a reason for doing that. He cannot be that bad. Then why did he starve his brother? And why lock him up for three days? - Right… - Such a sarcasm! - One is ugly, one is wicked. - Right… Yeah, unacceptable. So despicable. No more business between us, you hear me? Be human before you become an expert. Stop doing business with him. - You're too bad. - How wicked he is! - You're too bad. - Bury him! Yes, my bad. My brother got bad karma, because I had disclosured God's wills. The day I achieved gnosis, is the day my brother got a 45 Celsius degree fever for one week. He acts like a five-year-old kid. He had to stay in the hospital. Hospital expenses. Medicine costs. How did I pay the expenses? Where did I get the money? Right. I'm a gigolo. How honest he is! Feng Shui master is just my part-time job. Gigolo is my regular job. So, she is your… Oh, this lady is asking him to… I'm… I'm… I had to do this job… because I love my family. I need money to look after my own family. Money for my brother. Have I done something wrong? Can you tell me? - Really? - It's his livelihood. Khoa, I was too engaged in work to realize that… how much you needed me. You need your own brother. Brother! Brother! He has a reason! Don't blame him! We're even now. How miserable they are! Everybody! We all must do something to help Tu and his brother. We should do it now, otherwise Khoa may follow in his brother's footsteps one day. Correct. I will donate $150. Ladies and gentlemen. Many a little makes a mickle. Thank you very much. Tu. I almost misread you. I didn't know you had a difficult background. I will help you. Please express our gratitude to the last customer of Tu. No, I'm not his customer. I meant I will donate $250 for hospital expenses. That's very kind of you, your boundless beneficence. We still have many difficult situations like him out there. Anyone else? Help my brother, please. Thank you. Can you get Tu's phone number for me please? Right away, sir. Take this money and get the fuck out of here now. This is our place. You heard me? I was a part of this. We could get ten times this money without you, fucking spoilsport! We have nearly a grand here. Ten times this money means thousands of dollars, right? You bet! What are you up to? Boss! Can I join your gang? How many times have you spoiled my business today? You better fuck off now or I have to use the hard way. I beg you guys. Please give me a chance. What a stubborn freak! I'm broke and badly in debt. Not a chance to see my mom and daughter again if I'm unable to pay off my debt. I beg you guys. I bow down to beg you. All right. Let's go, Tu. Wait. Have you changed your mind? You wanna join us? Fine. But… return their wallets first. What the heck? Not only a bad appearance but also a bad habit. He's fucking fast. Just so you know, your pilferage did not surprise us at all. Uncle Nam and I just wanted to test your skill. That trick wouldn't even work with Tu. He took my wallet too. Tu wanted to test you too. Apology, my bad habit. Go. "Go" means you asked him to go away or to go with us? - I don't get it. - Support me, please. Tu, what do you mean? How can an elegant man like you live in this shabby place? No swindler owns a house. Instead of a house… we must have a solid base. Pretty cool. Is it cool? Shut your mouth. Now smile. Done. Okay. Men Malay costume expert cum IT. She gets 20% once the mission is complete. You're not pretty so I doubt you can make others look pretty. Making you look pretty is impossible. Go over there please. Uncle Nam, transporter, he can ride all means of transportation on all terrains. He will get the same 20% after a complete mission. Hi there. Can you ride a MILF? My ex-spouse is 12 years older than me. How so? You're a hecking awesome "rider". Share with me your experience. Your taste is weird. Uncle Nam, toss it out. I just had a sip. Here. Men Malay and Uncle Nam get 20% each per mission, then you get the 60% left? Don't you think it's too much? Nope, I'm a leader, I must plan for everything so as to ensure the mission is accomplished. You can be a leader if you want. No, thanks. Have you ever failed? I have not failed for 28 years. I only undertake a mission if the success is certain. Brilliant! On the other hand, I've completely failed for 29 years. Well, it means you're older than me? How do you want to be addressed? That's not important, I only care about your behavior. Call me whatever you want. How about my share per complete mission? Like I said, we cannot trust this freak. I don't care how much is his share, but I will kill you if it affects my share. No soft drink. Okay. Same to me, my share is untouchable. All right, let me think. Which day of the week is it today? Tuesday. Then your share is 3%. Can we use day of the month instead? Today is the 10th day of the month, so 10%. Number 10 is a round and lucky number. It's the same as a 10-point grade system. I will help the gangget 10 point, perfect result. How smooth-tongued you are, dude. Let's talk about that later, you should learn first. Can't wait! Where do we start? Start from scratch. Everyone, line up here. The hotel is nice! Now we will check in, get some rest and join the free activities for tonight. The best target is the one that has many serious drawbacks. What are their drawbacks? How about going to the spa inside our hotel? Hey, have you lost your mind? Spa service in a luxurious hotel is usually costly. Or we're going to a spa in the night market? We can save money for other stuff. Right? - Cheap is preferred. - Yeah. Right. Miserly, indecent. Correct, but not enough. Naive tourists like them is a key to our success. So, who would be our first ideal target? The older sister? TikToker? Then who? Your flag. My bad. - Excuse me. - Yes? Are you a tour guide? I am. - Can you speak Chinese? - Nope. So, where is your hometown and can I follow you home? What? Oh, sorry, it's just my parents told me to follow my dreams. Cheers! They want a low-cost tour, and also free-of-charge services. Guiding that group was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. It felt like putting some underwear on my head. I cannot do anything with the underwear on your head. But I can take care of the other one on your intimate parts. Cheers! - Fuck the tour. - Yep. - Fuck the responsibility. - Yep. - No work tomorrow. - Yep. - You only live once. - Yep. Is it perfect? Terrific! Conning without thorough preparation is the same as gambling. And I hate gambling. Ah, I inserted it contrariwise. We should insert it here down to the chin, at the silicone's edge. All right, give it a try. I hate gambling. Should I wanna do something, I will do it best. Welcome to Safaray zoo! Hi, everyone! Now the entry ticket is only $12 per person. Wow, only $12 per person? So why didn't we come here in the first place? Hey, $12 only. Cool, right? The companion of your expedition here is Mr. Vu Minh Kha, a professional tour guide at Safaray! Hello, hello! Safaray is the perfect choice. There are lots of wild animals here, especially predators. We have walked 0.6 miles so far, and we must walk over six miles more. Pardon me? What? No animals here. Can't even see a fly! We must go deep inside. Kha, I'm exhausted, can't even feel my legs anymore. I'm not gonna make it. - What is that noise? - Right. We should go home. That must be predators, they are hunting. Everyone, calm down. What is it? This "predator" looks awesome! You scared us out of our wits! - Who is he? - I proudly present to everyone, Mr. Nam Tiger, the zookeeper. Oh, God! My heart! Everyone should stay together. Those predators usually attack the prey that are separate. Your family must be the luckiest family in the world. You will have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see the last tiger in this zoo. Lucky, my ass. I encountered him once, he was that bad. What a relief. I dealt with him using this arm. - Really? - How about the other one? He took it away. They would accept any of our requests when they take the bait. You know what I meant? Go back to the hotel now. Relax. We are in the middle of the forest, so pickup service will be surcharged. How much? We don't care how much does it cost, just call the car. Call it now. Get us out of here, soon. Okay. The special service charge is $200 per person. - Excuse me? - $200 per person, that's inflated! I'm so sorry, but this is the company rule. No payment, no car. There was no prenotification ealier. Why only now? What if they choose money over their lives? Goddammit! What a tough player! Plan D, the final shot. Okay, okay. You waned, old man. - My turn. - You're old. My turn. Hurry, everyone. Be strong, everyone. Oh, my God, are you kidding? My gosh. - Come on, quickly. - Everybody! What is going on? Something strange? Our family is lucky again. You guys are looking at the last Hubabi clan in this forest. A genuine hunter-gatherer community. What do they hunt here, Uncle Nam? Deer, other animals, and so on. Uncle Nam! What do they hunt if they cannot find any deer to hunt? What the fuck is going on here? Come on, everyone! Call the car now! Only $200 per person. Discount, please! Here is your money. Thank you. Run! Pay for me! I'm messed up! Guys, Hai, run! Wait for me. Nam, Nam! Don't worry, I'm here! Grab my hand. Run! Run! - Mr. Nam. - Run! - Nam! - Don't worry about me! - Nam! - Run! Run! Nam! Thank you, Mr. Nam. Your money. Thank you so much! I deducted $5. Why? For stabbing me too hard. You want the full payment, - lie down for me to stab your back. - Come on! Let me stab your back now! $2,000 in that box. You told me 150$ per person the other day. They would say yes to everything in that moment. How greedy! Tu is gonna skin you if he knows, I swear. You'd better be careful. I understand. Here is another $1,000. Where did you get it? This is bereavement money for Uncle Nam's funeral from Ms. Hai. Can you do like I do? It's boom time for him. Next target is a black pearl. Gosh, this place is crowded. I doubt we can win the auction. Whatever you want I will get it for you, even if it's a star. Excuse me. What can I do for you, sir and ma'am? We're looking for a hall where a pearl ring called the Hidden Gem is on auction. It's in E5 Hall. Please follow me, sir. Shall we? Hey, you. My apologies. You called me, sir? I… - Who the hell are you? - Security guard. Can I help you? I'm the security captain. - Shoot. - Tell me where is your position. - Rooftop. - There is no one there. Right. Had nothing to do then I went down and ran into this couple while they were looking for the auction hall. It's not our duty. Which team are you in? Plan B. Team 5. We only have four teams in total, you said you're in… God, my bad. Apologies. - No worries. - My bad. Let me clean that up. - I got this. - No, it's my fault. - I got this, okay? - No. - I said I got this. - Let me do it. I'm so sorry. You're wet. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it! It's too slippery! Oh, shit! What have you done? Goddammit! Slippery floor! Sir! Sir, let me help you with your pants. Follow me, sir. Ladies and gentlemen. We proudly present the next item at the auction today. A masterpiece that was born in the deep sea. Hidden Gem, the pearl ring. A ring with a pearl on top collected from the record-breaking ocean depth in Vietnam. And we proudly present to you the owner of the ring, Mr. Pierre Tu Mac. The opening bid is $25,000. The minimum bid increment is $2,500. $27,500. $30,000. $35,000. $40,000. $40,000 from gentleman number 6. $42,500. $50,000. Wonderful. $50,000 from lady number 9, Ms. Jennifer Vu. $50,000, going once. - Honey! - Going twice. $52,500. $55,000. Sweetheart. Just give up. You cannot win anyway. $60,000. Oh, my goodness. $60,000. $60,000, going once. Going twice. $70,000. $70,000, going once. Going twice. Going triple. Congratulations! Ms. Jennifer Vu has become the new owner… I checked his cashflow. He would buy the ring if the price is around $45,000 to $50,000. Hey, he spoils his girlfriend a lot. Why don't you set the opening bid higher? That'd be a bit risky. I have an idea. During the bidding, Men Malay will try to push the price up until he gives up. Then we will know the maximum price he's willing to pay. And? Bao Ngoc! Bao Ngoc! You stay there. Leave me alone. Bao Ngoc! Bao Ngoc! My goodness! What the hell is going here, Khoa? Ms. Jennifer has requested a delay in payment for one week. Disagree. We all have confirmed that the payment would be settled in cash in 24 hour. Why do you two try to make this hard? The international wire transfer always takes more time to process than a normal transfer. I do not bilk. So do not make it hard. Sorry, but I'm not making anything hard here. I need money now for a personal matter. I informed you of the payment terms before the auction and you agreed with it. I don't want any trouble, right? Excuse me. I heard that you guys are having a problem with the payment? It's none of your concern. We're discussing it, can you please leave? Relax. I have $60,000 in cash. I was wondering if you're still interested in the ring. Will you please show me your respect? Pardon me, Ms. Jennifer. You're the one who did not respect our terms. Fuck your goddamn pearl! I don't need it. I really like decisive people like you. Deal! $60,000, not a penny more, not a penny less. Don't worry, just show me the ring. Here you go. It's beautiful. I should have told you this. I invited Mr. Daniel Tran who is a pearl appraiser here today. Don't get me wrong. $60,000 is a large amount of money, so this is necessary I guess. Mr. Daniel, please. Thanh Hoa! Thanh Hoa! Sir, your flowers. Oh, baby, why didn't you tell me? I'm really surprised. How sweet! We offer this special service to you as a thank you. Congratulations on tying the knot! Hey. Appraisal is not needed right now. All you need to do is to kneel. Kiss her, kiss her… Hey. I don't want to jinx us. What if he knows that the ring is counterfeit? The final step. Exit door. What does "exit door" means? That's the most important step in every conning mission. To distinguish an expert from an amateur. How so? We always prepare a way out for us, no matter what happens. Just don't get caught, then better luck next time. Kiss her, kiss her… Cheers! Thank you, everyone. My life has been full of failures before I met you guys. I didn't have any luck either. Now working with you guys is my biggest luck. Don't think I can bear a cheesy speech from your mouth. You can call this destiny. Right. Everyone has their own destiny. Your Uncle Nam had a pretty tough destiny. Today I will tell you about my life. - No need to tell us. - Right, no need to tell us. I'm feeling pretty chilled, let me tell him. - No need. - You don't need to tell him. He is the new member, he should know more about the others. He is the new member, he should know more about the others. - Cheers! - Don't be rude like that. We're a team, we should know each other. You two always stop me whenever I wanna talk about my life. Oh. Why don't you two let him talk? He feels slighted. - Don't worry. - Don't worry. He always wants to talk about his life whenever we drink. - Come on, cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello, hello. God, I didn't expect he would do this. Fifteen years ago, there was a good-looking man. He feared no danger. He feared no hardship. He delivered joy to people day by day. - What did you do? - Tobacco smuggling. Correct. I worked very hard day and night to look after my wife and kid. One day, one of my transports went wrong. My legs were broken. Plus seven years in jail. My wife couldn't stand that suffering, then she decided to remarry. Khoa. Do you think I felt sad? - Sad, of course. - I didn't. 'Cause I knew it was my destiny. I have never blamed her. Then I got out of jail, I tried to make as much money as I could to make it up to my son. I worked like a dog. Ironically, that fucking destiny kept clinging to me like a leech. One day he fell sick and I arranged to transfuse my blood to him. That was the time I found out he was not my son. He is not my son. Why? Who can answer me? Why he is not my son? Uncle Nam! Nam! - It's alright. - Leave uncle Nam alone. Only the ocean water - can stop Uncle Nam's tears now. - Why is he not my son? Why? I'm an orphan. You too? I lived in an orphanage as a kid. There were a couple who came to adopt a child, they wavered between me and my friend. That night we hugged each other and cried on the bed. She told me I should be adopted so that I could return to the orphanage to visit her regularly. What a good friend. Yep, pretty fucking good. In the morning the day after, she told me she would pretend to be sick and I could go to the living room alone. Then I went to the living room and told the nuns what she had said. When I was about to be adopted by that couple, she came with another nun, then she pointed her finger at me saying that I lied to her and intentionally locked her up so that I could get adopted. Good friend, my ass. Done. I was an orphan again. Then I became a liar and nobody believed me anymore. I was obsessed by those despised looks, those disgraceful comments. Finally I climbed over the fence and have been living on my own since then. You're next. Tell us. Khoa, where is he? Sir! Sir, Please! I'm begging you! He's gone. Where is he? Sir, please! Sir! Sir! Sir! I'm begging you! Sir! I'm begging you! Sir! My business failed and I ended up deep in debt. My presence at home brought my mom… and my kid… misery every day. Shit, you're too late! Get in! I'm sorry. We can go now. Dad! - Linh! - Dad! - Wait! - Dad. Linh. Dad! Linh. Dad. You must go, don't you? Dad, I have this for you. Come on, man. Go or stay? Hurry up. Go! Let's go! Dad! Dad! Linh! Dad. Dad! Oh, dear. Your life is way darker than your skin. Cheers! Destiny! You're nothing! You once pushed me down to the ground, but today I must thank you for giving me these friends. Everyone has their own wishes In their lives Whenever they feel sad or hard done by Sometimes we want to share Our memories Please always keep this friendship in mind Call my name, my dear friends It will help you stay wide awake. Your beer drinking skills are bad, huh? These two glasses are for you, you shit. Have a seat, I'll go buy some beers. No, no. Enough. Too bad! - Tu. - What? Can you do me a favor? What is it? When will you raise my share? We have earned a lot of money so far. I'm gonna do everything you want me to do as long as I have enough money to pay off my debt. A piece of cake. Just show me you're worthy. Among the targets whom we are looking into, I have successfully picked the two biggest and best targest. Well, you planned all of this. What a greedy man! You should be happy when your student learns well. Well done. NGUYEN KIM KHANH - GENDER: FEMALE DATE OF BIRTH: 18 OCT 1977 BLOOD TYPE: B CEO OF THIEN NGOC KIM KHANH JSC Boring!

The directors of the event company will land at 10:00 AM tomorrow. I will reschedule all the meetings to the afternoon, it is okay? Keep the meeting with the event company only. Remember to set the stage properly, this is our big event. Yes. Let's finish here, okay? Okay, call. I really wanna know what are your hole cards that make you confident like that. Two gamers. Wow, a full house with nine pair. Outstanding. I lost. Okay, it's all for today. Hey, I will keep an eye on you guys. Rematch someday, okay? - Yes. - Go. I intentionally used all-in to force you show your hole cards. But you didn't let me know till the end? I promise you, should we have a rematch in the near future, I will show you my hole cards. - Okay? - Drive safe. Good morning, sir. We are staff of Thien Ngoc Minh Khanh. This event is very important to our company and Ms. Khanh herself, so she has prepared a distinguished working place for you two. "Primal beauty" is the main theme of this event and through this event we would like to dignify primeval value that human beings receive from nature. No cellphones, no internet, no other electronic devices. We will keep your luggage and will come back to pick you up in the next 30 days. You two will stay here to discover all the primal beauty on this island, Then please think how to create a unique event in Vietnam. Otherwise? Otherwise, we will send you guys back to Hanoi immediately. Amazing! We have waited for a client like Ms. Khanh for so long. We're not gonna return to the mainland if this event is not the best one in Vietnam. Exactly. It was with winds that waves began But where did they begin, the winds? Neither do I remember now When did it all begin, our love? See you again. Why have they not showed up yet? I contacted them all morning, but couldn't reach them. You call this professional? Gentle greet, my Lucy. Hey. - How? - Hey. You two still remember me? - How can we not remember you? - Hello. It was an accident only. I unintentionally heard that your company is an event company, is it true? Yes, our company is based overseas, but we also intend to expand our business activity to Vietnam. Ah, please take my business card. Thank you. You can scan the QR code on the card to see our company profile. Okay. Brilliant indeed. I was right about you two. You're flattering us. I'm a straight person, so I don't like beating around the bush. We're about to hold an incentive paying event here. It's expected to happen in the next four weeks. Are you interested in working with our company this time? May we know the scale of your event? Frankly we normally do large-scale events only, for the small-scale events we're afraid… The expected budget for this event is around $1.5 million. - Pardon? - $1.5 million. Could you please excuse us for a second? What? It's not the right time to be excited. She is looking at us now. You must pretend that we're debating her suggestion. And more importantly, we don't let them know what we're thinking. Got it. Last Friday, who massaged you? It was Huong. Did she do well? Damn, she did very good. How about you? Hung "beard". Fuck him, I still don't understand why Ms. Dao sent him to massage me? I guess sometimes you should experience another massager's skills. Are you crazy? He has halitosis, it's terrible. Unacceptable. It seems our suggestion is not okay with them. What do you think? Let's see. - Overacted. - Did I overact? - Yep. Act normally. - How about now? Be serious. Now listen to me. Take a deep breath… keep your head up… and turn left. Go. - Yes. - Sis. - To be honest… - Allow me to chime in. I have just decided to increase the budget to $2 million and 10% of the contract value will be transferred once the proposal is approved. With that budget I think… $2.5 million. We have so many things to do for this event. All those things must be done in only four weeks. $2.5 million is not a fixed number. We will come up with an exact number after a more thorough discussion. Take your time to think about it and call us later. We're on vacation anyway. See you around. What the heck are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Trust me this time. $2 million only, you idiot! Wait! I really like you two. I agree! $2.5 million. Hello, everyone. Now I would like to present an unprecedented event in our S-shaped country. The event's theme is about primal beauty. I just want to ensure that the event would be awesome. Please allow me to introduce you to a supercar trader, Mr. Johnny Nguyen. I can tell you about carriage, wagon, but supercar, I'm out. I have not ever driven any. What would I present to them? Now it's time for research. I will test you regularly. Oh, dear. As per your request, I've finished all required paperwork to import three cars. The first one, a Lamborghini Huracan with V10 engine. 580 HP, engine displacement 5.9L. Price $700,000. The next one, a Ferrari 488 Pista, price $400,000. And the final one, a Porsche Cayenne, price $200,000. These three cars are expected to arrive at the port in the next five days. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Johnny Nguyen. Ladies and gentlemen, you can tell an event good or bad by having a look at the menu. Now I proudly introduce to everyone, the 2015 Indonesian MasterChef. A 3-star Michelin chef. Ms. Luvita Gudino. What a coincidence! I can speak Indonesian. Where are you from? I'm from Semarang. Kool! Can I play a foreigner? Why are you so demanding? Why are you so dumb? A foreign chef is more superior, it will help us gain the target's trust. Understand? So what nationality you prefer? Indonesian. You should choose Malaysian. Then a Malaysian Indonesian. That's our capital and also a tourist attraction, but for me, that place is filled with childhood memories. To ensure she trusts us and deposit $250,000 with us, what we have planned is not enough. Did you miss something? The stage. You're smarter. OVERVIEW That's how we design, build the stage, and the workflow of this show. Good idea! Money, money. Have a look at your fruit. Smell good? We want our share. We'll share it after the meal. - One by one. - Okay, okay. Eat fast. - Malay, give me the shrimp. - No money, no shrimp. - Uncle Nam. - My arms are paralyzed, don't ask me. Goddamn you two. Everyone, I have a game, do you want to play? - Is it fun? - Yup! Okay. His face looks trustful. I have two envelopes here. If I say one of them is twice the other and you can change, will you change it? I won't change. Money is secured in my hand, change it for what? I will change, why I do that? $50 is equal to twice $25, right? $100 is equal to twice $50. What if I lose? What have I lost? I lost only $25, but if I win, what would I win? I win $100. Then I will change. Open it, open it. Double it! It's $100. That's twice. What do you think if it is tenfold? We use $250,000 to make a real big event so that we end up getting $2.5 million from her. Are you in or out? I'm in. I would get enough money to go to Korea for a boob job and other surgeries also, if possible. I'm in too. I need money for the home that I have dreamt of for so long. All in! - All in. - All in. Cheers! - Korea, wait for me. - Cheers! - Uncle Nam. - Cheers! Make a plan, Khoa. Thank you. Cheers. I've already planned everything, we would get that $2.5 million if we stick to the plan. It's kinda risky though. Let me do this, I need this money. I thought that $250,000 will help you pay off the debt. Yeah, but I still need money for my daughter. This is the final catch, then I will go home for good. Let me think, but this mission is very risky. I will find you another one. Do you fear failure? You're confident all the time, but deep in your heart you fear failure. Can you keep your mouth shut? What the fuck do you know, huh, you goddamn loser? I told you. I don't belive in this shit. I won't! You don't believe in my plan or in me? Why did you let me join the team while you don't believe in me? Huh? You don't believe me, fine! But do you really want them going with you to deceive people for the rest of their lives? One scam is counted, ten scams are counted. Why don't you let us move to the next chapter? You're selfish. You only wanna be in your safe zone to enjoy the feeling of victory alone. You don't even care about the others! Tu. We're family, why are we yelling at each other? I don't care about the dream house anymore. What I care about now is that you guys are happy. That's correct. Happy is our goal. I changed my mind, I'm not going to Korea. I know a plastic surgeon in Long An province, low-cost surgery, then I can have a boob job there. You two don't have to argue with each other about the money. We are family. That's the paramount issue. Tu, back to your seat and drink. Right. It's okay to save your dream today for tomorrow. Now we get more wine, more beer to have fun… Stop! Tomorrow… I need your detailed plan. Khoa! Who locked this door? Khoa, Khoa. - Uncle Nam. - Hey, not me. He looked at you. He didn't look at me to ask. - Uncle Nam! - He kept the key. - I left it in the car. - You again? You come in here. You must drink three glasses of wine. - Down to the last drop, you hear me? - I must be dead. - Down to the last drop. - I'll get drunk! - Cheers! - Cheers! Hello? Excuse me, I need to take this. Bottoms up. I know. It looks like the fish here can understand human. Of course not. I'm good. Good? Come on. You can tell me anything. Honestly, 10% of the contract value paid in advance is not enough. The contract is only a document to confirm our commitments. To ensure the project is on track, we have to pay our vendors 80% in advance on our end. The timeline is too tight for us to manage the money. I'll help you, okay? It can't be. This is our first collaboration, the contract has been signed already. You said the contract is just to confirm our commitments. Right? How about this? I will ask the board of directors to come with me to observe your preparation. Try to show us the best demo of the event. Based on your work, I can convince the board to pay your company the remaining 90% of the contract value. Then your company can do whatever you want for the event. Really? Oh, dear! You're so kind to us. Deal? Thank you so much! I promise I will go to any lengths to do this event. One, two, three, cheers! Khoa! Come here and sign the contract. Khoa. Sign it. Wait. You should count it. No need. You trusted us and agreed to pay in full in advance, then we must trust you in return. Good collaboration. Good collaboration. - Sister Khanh! - Thu Cuc! Hello, sis. - Oh, boy, I have waited for you. - Yes. - You good? - I'm good. Okay. - I saw her. - That's Khoa and Tu. You should become Tu the gigolo again. Are you nuts? They organized the incentive paying event of my company. Over $2 million of mine. A foreign company, specializing in large-scale events planning. They're so close. I know. Let me think. - So handsome. - Oh really? Let me introduce them! - Pickaboo. - What the hell are you doing? This is how we celebrate after signing a contract. - Rave it up. - Rave it up. - Rave it up. - Rave it up. Khoa. Let's hop on the bus. Let's go around. Tu gigolo! And his retarded brother. What does it mean? A Feng Shui master prostitues himself to raise his brother. Why did you become an owner of an event company today? Thu Cuc! Long time no see, Thu Cuc. What did you come here for? To punch you two scammers in your faces. It's not like what Thu Cuc said. This is a long story. We shouldn't tell a long story. Rave it up! Watch out! Oh, my God. My money. Scammers. Oh, dear. Scammers. My God! My money! Excuse me, sir. Are you okay? I'm sorry. Are you okay? Run, run. Over there. Get them. Stop there! Hey, my motorbike. It's mine. It's mine. - Thief. Thief. - Thief. - Thief. - It's mine. - Thief. - Thief. Motherfuckers! Stop right now! Stop, scammers! Stop! Hey! Stop now! Motherfuckers! Stop! Get the fuck out of here. Move! You fucking move now! You better watch out! You good? We're good? How dare you! A boat will arrive in the next ten minutes. So we leave here for good? We can stay anywhere with this money. Hold on. Can you open the suitcase and show me $2 million? I have never seen that large amount of money in my life. Khoa, open it please. Wait, wait. - What is this? - Tu! What is it? They set me up. Uncle Nam. You guys want this? Then take it. That's not what I want. He wants something else. What you want is to see my team steal the money in public. Am I right, Ms. Khanh? Brilliant, brilliant. You deduced my plan quickly. Only a senior swindler can do so. It turns out that you're also a hustler. Exactly. I wanna teach you guys a lesson. Women scam people better than men do. Because men always think they're smarter. He is my brother, do not make him yours. Please don't take him from me. What is it? We won't have enough money for our incentive paying event if you keep throwing money around. Not enough? Fine. I don't care. I know how to turn $250,000 into $2.5 million. I intentionally used All-in to force you to show your hole cards. But you didn't let me know till the end? Greedy boy! You won and you still want to see my hole cards. To be frank, I like you guys very much. Looking at you… I have a feeling that you guys are younger versions of me. Enthusiatic. Eager. But immature. Tu! Run! - Run faster, everyone. - Get them. Stop! Ms. Khanh, if you want to take one of us, then take me only. I swear on my life, I will keep this under my hat. These kids will leave the island today. Is it okay, Ms. Khanh? You should know one thing, old man. Only the dead can keep silent. - Uncle Nam! - Uncle Nam! Jump! Come on, Khoa! Useless! If they're dead, I wanna see their bodies. Go. Uncle Nam. Khoa! Tu! Open your eyes and look at me. Khoa! Go find a vehicle. Khoa! Are you deaf? I just wanna do the last mission. Last mission? Look at Uncle Nam over there! It's all your fault. Because of your greed. You're greedy for money. I'm the only one who is greedy for money? How about Uncle Nam? And Men Malay? You… you get the biggest share among us! Asshole! Are you fucking crazy? Uncle Nam is dying. Tu! Fuck off, you son of a bitch! I have prepared this for you. Go. I'm sorry. For what? If it's not your fault, what are you sorry for? You're right. I'm the one who fear failure. The scariest thing after you fail is that you don't know how to face up to that failure. What would you do? Keep going where I failed. They're gonna kill you. So running away like you would be the best way? Fuck you! I don't wanna flee. I still have my mom and a child at home waiting for me. Don't use your family as an excuse. That's cowardly. I'm a coward. Fine. It's still better than having to tell my daughter that this is money I got from deceiving people, you feel free to spend it. Fuck! You still don't understand, do you? If you win this mission, and another 5-million-dollar mission, and 10-million-dollar mission… would you stop? You lost your brother and sister, your family… lost everything because you were fucking greedy, you shit. Keep on being greedy, keep losing. Why do they wanna kill us? They successfully gave us the fake money and blamed us. They probably wanted us to keep silent. How silent? We don't have any evidence to expose them. Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh cosmetic company, its sales primarily comes from new agencies who buy products for hoarding, not for resale. They had no new agencies post COVID. Ms. Khanh is the operator on top, she was supposed to take all the money and flee. Why doesn't she do it now? Because that's her final catch. Everyone has their own wishes In their lives Whenever they feel sad Or hard done by Sometimes we want to share Our memories Please always keep this friendship In mind Two, three… - Call my name… - Stop! Turn off your ringtone, Uncle Nam. Get back to work. Ouch, it hurts. Why did you play that? I thought it was fun. "Her final catch", what do you mean? $2.5 million is not really her objective. She wants to steal more money through this event. EVENT: THE PURE BEAUTY What is Ms. Khanh's objective? - Money. - A large amount of money. Exactly, there's a huge amount of money behind this event. She has to transfer that money to an account for covering the costs. This laptop has a private satelite connection. - Take a look. - Malay. You can hack it, can't you? Why am I here if I can hack everything? Then we steal it. Are you dumb? You wanna do it the hard way while you can't even steadily walk. You're the weakest one here. Give me a car and I will show you who I am. Okay, I invite you to the highway for a race. Stop! - Showy! - Focus on the mission. When we have that laptop in hand, we'll still require her fingerprint to get the money. The index finger, right hand. Then we cut off her index finger. I would gladly return her a stab. There are ten bodyguards. We are four, defying the odds. We all four can barely defeat one of them. Wow! Fighting is later, first we must figure out how to go pass a security check and disable those security cameras. Wonderful. It's getting complicated. And you two already had a plan, right? Nope. EVENT: THE PURE BEAUTY - Are you okay? - The prizes are iPhone, supercars… - Welcome to the event. - Thank you. What? Hey, where is my ticket? - What? - Welcome. Please step aside. Send some guys to Zone 1 for support. Oh, boy, where are the fish sauce and seasoning? How can I cook without them? Hey! Call the supplier. Oh, boy. May I know who will receive this stuff? Okay, good luck. Have a good day. Wonderful. Wish you all the best, everyone. Outstanding. You would receive a lot of money after this event. Yes, for sure. Ladies and gentlemen, and now is the greatest moment in this event tonight. We proudly present and welcome to the stage the respectful captain who has been steering our Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh boat into these remakable successes. Let's have a big round of applause for president Nguyen Kim Khanh. Good evening, everyone. Has anyone made a packet this year? Already! Now I will reveal the three lucky owners of the three super cars parked in front of you. These are the three agencies who had the highest sales last year. Please welcome Ms. Vu Nguyen Hoang Oanh. Ms. Tran Thi Thuy Van. Mr. Do Thanh Chung. Here you go. What is it? I didn't order it. Yes, you did. Let's have a big round of applause… …please return to your seats. Now please listen to the treasured speech of Ms. Kim Khanh. And let's see what are new opportunities for all the agencies coming up. Please. Dear valued agencies, today I have good news and bad news that I want to share with you. Last year was quite a difficult year for us all. However, our company still had stable earnings. The good news is that all the economic experts agreed that, based on the current impetus of economic recovery, next year would be a golden year for the whole market and Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh. And I have set a goal for us. It's 600%. Then what does it mean? It means it will be a sixfold increase in return on investment applied to all the investors. The bad news is, however, that Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh won't receive any new investments this year. Everyone calm down. Do you know why are you standing here right now? Because you're all the creators, the first creators along with me, helping me build this successful Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh empire. This also means all of you deserve a gift from the company. Right? Now we all have two hours in total, only two hours for your investments. After this time, all investments will be rejected. This means Thien Ngoc Kim Khanh won't receive any investments, even a penny. Ms. Khanh! Can I use this award to re-invest into the company? Then you will receive six supercars next year. Now, we have one hour and 59 minutes left for the investment. I don't care about the interest. I'll take it all! Just mortgage our house. Trust me! Sell that lot and give me the money. I will buy six lots for you later. Can I use this pension to invest? Yes, you can. Madam. We've got a problem. The restroom's door is locked, come here and help me unlock it. Sis. Hao has been locked away in Area A. You two go help Hao, the rest come with me to the security room. - Quick! - Yes. Where is Mrs. Khanh? She went to the security room. Fuck, they set us up. The suitcase requires a passcode to open. How many numbers? - Three. - Try 0-0-0. Incorrect. Try from 0-0-0 to 9-9-9. Are you mad? It'll take me years to do that. All right, I have an idea. Try using numerology. What is numerology? Every letter in Khanh's name corresponds to a number. The sum of those numbers will give you numbers corresponding to her full name. Can you speak English please? Never mind, let me calculate it for you. Nguyen. Five plus seven plus three plus seven plus five plus five equals 32. Three plus two equals 5. Kim. Two plus nine plus four equals 15. One plus five equals six. Khanh. Two plus eight plus one plus five plus eight equals 24. Two plus four equals six. - 5-6-6, right? - Right. Correct. Damn it, we're fucked. Well, are you looking for this? You better stop these ridiculous things now. Otherwise, I'll kill him. What should we do now? Activate the exit door. Bring him. So this is your exit door? I just need to stay here and relax for ten days, after that I will be in a non-extradition country. You're smart. You want to clear all traces. Smart? You know I'm smart, but you still came back to thwart me? Listen up, boy. If you were smarter than me, I should be the revenger, not you. You think you got the upper hand on us? Hurry up. Khoa. Hurry up. The laptop processes this, not me. She definitely won't stay away from the laptop, this plan is just the first step. The second step is… To push her into activating the exit door. Exactly. The exit door is the most important step in deceit, but it's also vulnerable. Let's say we did it, how do we deal with those bodyguards? We cannot defeat them, but we can pin them down for a few minutes. Where is Mrs. Khanh? She went to the security room. I'm exhausted. It's almost done. Keep trying. Stop! Or I'll kill him! Jump! Don't worry about me! I'm gonna count to three. One. Two. Are you insane? Fuck you! You're fucking useless. Right? The money was in your hand, but you threw it away. And you still want to fuck with me? We're not merciless like you. Take the money and run. Don't you think karma will pay you back for your misdeeds someday? Huh? Karma? My goodness, a scammer is speaking about ethics. Do you know how much time and effort I put into this company? You two and those agencies in that event are the same. You wanted to get my money. You were deceived because of your greed. Am I right? Whatever I do, I do it big. I get everything. Then I will disappear, traceless. I'm on a different level. You're just immature foxes. Speaking of karma. We've arrived at the port. - Get rid of them. - Yes. Definitely karma. But for you or for us, we don't know yet. You have been stunned twice by failure, haven't you? Huh? Let me tell you, out there… So don't even think you'll get away, even you have wings. I think there will be more than 20 men. What do you mean by that? Let's see. I racked my brain trying to overcome you. We're not as experienced as you. We're not as smart as you. But we realized one thing, that we're not as greedy as you. You wouldn't even think that we don't need this money. Right? You two and those agencies in that event are the same. You wanted my money so you were tricked. How can I deceive you if you're not greedy? You intended to set me up in the first place. Goddammit! Take off my hand! Save your strength. Use it to explain everything to them. Everybody. All your money is here. Contact Ms. Khanh if you wanna get your money back. - Give my money back… - Give my money back… Careful! Hey. Why don't you go down there? Still regret that money? This time we did it for nothing. I don't mind it, why do you have to mind? To me, victory is more important than money in this case. - You got it, greedy boy? - Hey. I'm not greedy anymore. - Keep greedy. - Keep losing. Khoa. Tu. What is it? Hey, old man. Old man. I told you, that goddamn old fox stabbed me once then she had no choice but to get a stab in return. Uncle Nam, we love you! - Good job! - Cheers. Cheers! Hey, I'd like to take this time to recall my past, is it okay? No, no. Calm down! - Calm down! - Let me tell it! Eighteen years ago… We've been here for nearly a month, but have not came up with any ideas yet. Right. We need more time to look into this. How about this? We will ask them for one month more when they come. It would give us more time for research. That's right. We must create a world class unique event. Once in a thousand years. Waves. It was with winds that waves began But where did they begin, the winds? Neither do I remember now When did it all begin, our love? I got an idea. Nope, my turn. I'm gonna put a pump here. And another one here, a high-power one. We will make negative artificial waves along the coconut trees! …2,000 Watt… go direct to the core system… Let me put a pump here and there! Khoa! Khoa! You're such a dog, why don't you… Hey. You talk to your VIP guest like that? You want a kick? - What's up? - I'm good. Good morning, sir. Who is he? - Hello, ma'am. - Yeah. He's my friend, together we have… Ah, we together have shared joys and sorrows in many things. - Have you? How kind of you. - Yes. Ah, it's only something small, but I hope you like it. Oh no, you shouldn't have! Just come by. You're welcome, please take it. Thank you very much. Thank you. You two keep talking, I have to prepare lunch. - Yes. - Go inside, sweetie. Yes. Go. My family is poor, there is no one for you to deceive. Are you out of your mind? You want to stay here, then gifts for me. No worries, I already prepared it. Give it back. - Give what? - My wallet. - What wallet? - You little shit. Are you still interested in this pilferage? Are you mad? My mom is here, how can I pickpocket you in front of her? So what? Where is my wallet? Who knows? Are you crazy? I put my wallet in this pocket. Now I can't find it. Now… Wait.
