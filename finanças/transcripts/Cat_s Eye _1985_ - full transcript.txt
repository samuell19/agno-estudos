Help me. Help me. Up here. Look up here. Help me. You've got to find it. It's after me. You've got to get back and find it. You've got to stop it. Please, help me. You've got to help me. Please. Nice little pussycat, yeah. You're gonna save me a trip to the pound. What are you so excited about, huh? What am I, a cat psychologist? - Well, this is the place. - I don't know about this, Jim. - You said you wanted to quit these. - Yeah, I know, I know, I know. - But I'd just like to know what they... - Go on, Dickie, before you lose your guts. Well, why don't you come up with me at least? It doesn't work that way. Against the rules. What is this? A quit-smoking clinic or the CIA? It's gonna turn your life around, Dick. I guarantee it. That's what Jim Jones said when he spiked the punch. I guess this is where you come to quit smoking, right? - Fill one of these out, please. - No, no. I have a pen. Honey! Are you all right? Sweetheart. Darling. No, no, no! Precious. My precious. - It's all right. You're gonna be fine. - Take me home. Home? I'll take you home. Hang onto me. I've been a smoker for a long time... Since I was sixteen. It is very hard. Uh, come on, now. Here. Come on. OK. The elevator is down here. One step at a time. - Hi. Excuse me. - I'll take that for you. Well, you know, actually, I think I've changed my mind. - Mr. Morrison? - Yeah? Yes? - Sorry to keep you waiting. - No, really. It's all right. - I was just saying... - Come with me. - We're about to change your life. - For the better, I hope. - The founding father? - Please, Mr. Morrison. I see you have a daughter who's 10. Uh... Alicia. You left the space for her school blank. Where my daughter goes to school really has no connection with whether or not your organization can help me to quit smoking, Mr. Donatti. Ahem. So... - Are we gonna get down to it or not? - Yes, of course. In fact, we've already started getting down to it. Do you have cigarettes with you? Does a bear shit in the woods? May I have them, please? Our methods here at quitters incorporated are rather radical, Mr. Morrison. Well, as a treatment, Mr. Donatti, they suck. There's a newsstand down in the lobby. They sell all brands. - You know what I mean? - Availability is only part of the problem. The fall-back rate for reformed smokers is higher than the fall-back rate for heroin addicts. You can spare me the Reader's Digest lecture, my friend, because... I've changed my mind. Will you open this door? You've got a hell of a problem, Mr. Morrison, but we here at quitters incorporated have developed a hell of a solution. Look, you're gonna develop a hell of a problem with my lawyers if you don't open this goddamn door! Relax, Mr. Morrison. Here's something that might interest you. Watch closely, Mr. Morrison. Nothing up either sleeve. And you'll notice at no time does my hand leave my wrist. - The music is part of his conditioning. - Shake it up, baby Shake it up, baby Twist and shout Boogie down, baby. Come on, baby Come on, baby Come on and work it on out Come on and work it on out Yeah, work it on out, honey Work it on out Yeah, you look so good Yeah, you look so good What are you doing? Stop it. You're killing him! Kill the nice kitty? No, no. He's fine. Maybe a little crispy around the paws, but otherwise, he's fine. Damn it. You barbecue all the cats you want. If you don't have me out of here inside of 15 seconds I'm gonna call the cops on you faster than you can say Marlboro man. You better listen to the big picture, Mr. Morrison. Quitters incorporated was endowed by a very important person. After he died of lung cancer, we realized that there were certain techniques that he had developed in the family business that we can now use to stop people from smoking. Actually, this is a very nice tax gimmick. But mainly, we're interested in helping our fellow man. For the first month, our operatives will have you under constant supervision. You may see some of them all of the time. You may see all of them some of the time. But believe me, Mr. Morrison, you'll never see all of them all of the time. If you smoke, they'll see you. And bring me down here and stick me in the old cat room, I suppose. No... We'll bring your wife down here and stick her in the cat room. You'll get to watch. I'm a man of medicine. I'm expected to save lives and ease suffering, and I love people. Therefore, I would have no choice... but to kill the son of a bitch. Kill the son of a bitch. Good idea. - What did you say? - What? - Huh? - Nothing. I was... - I can't believe this is happening. - Oh, it's happening, Mr. Morrison. First offense, your wife gets the juice. Not too much. Just enough to hurt. Second time, we bring your daughter Alicia here. Imagine, Mr. Morrison, your daughter in there instead of the cat. The third offense, I'm afraid I have to send someone out to rape your wife. There's a rather disturbed individual we keep around here just for such distasteful jobs. In the meantime, content yourself knowing that only 2% of our clients ever fall from grace a fourth time. And if they do? Then we give up, Mr. Morrison. - Oh, God... God! - What's wrong? - Well, I spilled my drink! - Well, I'm sorry, Dick... but as long as you keep using your left tit for a coaster, that's gonna happen. Shit! I have no idea what's going on in this damn movie anyway. I don't know who writes this crap! - Dick. - What? - What's wrong? - Nothing. You're like a bear tonight. What is it? It's nothing! Well, it's everything. I mean, I quit smoking today. Since when? Five minutes ago? Since 3:00... quarter to 3:00 this afternoon. You haven't had a cigarette in six hours? Uh, 6 hours and 23 minutes. Cindy, I'm trying to get some ice cream here, OK? What in the world made you decide to quit? I'm doing it for you... and for Alicia. That's the sweetest thing I ever heard. Even if you don't make it, we both thank you. I think I'll make it. Shit! Jesus! God! Hello. Is somebody in there? I didn't smoke it, see? If you're in there, would you tell Donatti that I didn't smoke it, see? I actually was just, uh... coming to get my golf clubs. - Want some coffee? - Jesus! I assume that's a yes. Talk about aversion therapy. Jesus. That's it. That's it. Daddy! Hi, baby. Whoa! OK, eyes closed and there we go! OK, now, we're skipping with eyes closed. We're gonna skip over to... Here. Are those eyes closed? Are they closed? I think they're open. Are they closed? - Are they real tight? - Yeah. We don't want to spoil any surprises, OK. I think now it's time to open them. Ah. Thank you, daddy! - Thank you! Thank you! - OK, I'm glad you like it, honey. You know what? I love you, Alicia. - What's its name? - His name... I think it's right here on the tag. Its name is Norma Jean. - Nor-ma... - Norma... - Jean. - Jean. Huh? I love Norma Jean! I'm glad, baby. OK, honey, come on. You got Norma Jean, you got her shoe, and you got her little adoption papers. Look after the kid and be a good girl, OK? Sister? OK, bye, honey. - Bye. - Bye, dad. You love her a lot, don't you? One of your men was in my closet last night, in my home! - Really? - Yes, really. That's possible, I suppose. Constant supervision for the first month is what we promise. Constant supervision is just what the client gets. - You're a son of a bitch. - Yes, I'm a son of a bitch. It takes a son of bitch to beat the habit. People who are unable to turn into sons of bitches on their own behalf, come to us. We give them what they need. Believe me, we do. I didn't smoke. I don't know what your hoods told you, but I didn't smoke! If you had lit that cigarette in your mouth, you wouldn't be here right now. You'd be down at my office watching your wife hop around in the little room. You love your wife, you love your kid, unfashionable these days, but useful. I think you're gonna make it, Mr. Morrison. We'll be watching you. Every breath you take Every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I'll be watching you An asshole like me could stay in business. I said it wasn't easy, but with assholes like him around, I got by. Not bad, huh? No. Not bad at all. Can I get a bourbon? So he says, "what do you think the S.E.C.'s gonna say when they hear about this?" Two things... First they're gonna say they heard it all before. Second, they're gonna say P.T. Barnum was right. There's a sucker born every minute. Earth to Dick. Earth to Dick Morrison. Come in, Dick! I'm sorry. I'm just a little tired. Kind of under the weather. - Have a cigarette. - Yeah... no! Thanks. Sorry. I quit. I did, really. Sure. No. Two weeks ago. Done. Two weeks, two months, two years. It doesn't matter. A big presentation comes along, a make-or-break meeting, a marathon sales conference... boom, you'll be right back on it. Come on. Have a cigarette. Come on. Have a cigarette! No, really. I gave those babies up. Hey, gang! The smoking lamp is lit again! Every word you say Every game you play Every night you stay I'll be watching you Oh, can't you see You belong to me? Dickie. Why don't you shove it up your ass, Hal. Every step you take What? Lit? Shit! Cindy! Cindy! Cindy! Cindy! Cindy! Cindy! Cindy? Hello, Mr. Morrison. It seems we have some business to attend to. Will 5:00 be all right? You know, it was just a slip, Mr. Donatti. It was just a little, small slip. You know? I mean... really, I swear it won't happen again. You know, it's funny... it didn't even taste good. I'll count on you for 5:00, shall I? No, no! Donatti! Donatti! You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! - Where's my wife, you turd?! - Hello, Mr. Morrison. He tried to get smart with his fists, but unfortunately, he's got very dumb fists. Where's Cindy? Don't, you idiot! Oh, fiddlysticks! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Here, kitty! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Forget the cat, you hemorrhoid! Get the gun! Get up, Mr. Morrison. Let's not have any more of this foolishness. Open the door! I understand your agitation. It will not be held against you, - at least not by me. - Please, Mr. Donatti, please! You be a good boy, Mr. Morrison, and don't provoke Junk again. I will make this as brief as possible. Your wife will not be hurt this time. Watch him, Junk. Too many teardrops For one heart To be cryin' Too many teardrops For one heart To carry on Remember, it just like getting a shot at the doctor's office. You're way out on top now Since you left me You're always laughin' Ow! Stop! Way down at me But watch out, now I'm gonna get there We'll be together Stop it! Would you stop it? You're killing her! Take it easy, Mr. Morrison. She'll be fine. Way down here... I think you've got some explaining to do, don't you? Hey, boss, ain't you gonna turn the sound up? There's no reason to. When you been in the business as long as I have, you get to know every line. In 30 seconds, she's either gonna squeeze this guy hard enough to give him a hernia, or she's gonna slap him in the face and walk out. - 10 bucks says she slaps him. - You're on. Oh, darn. - No, back about there. - No, no. - See, look. - No, no. No, that's eight pounds in six months, Vinnie. I don't think that's so bad really. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We gotta watch it. 73% of our clients get a weight problem the minute they quit smoking. Now, I want you to get dressed, and you and I will have a talk. - You gotta watch it. - OK. Junk, you think eight pounds is bad in six months? I think it's great. So remember, now, some of these diet pills are highly illegal so I want you to use them sparingly. Now I'm setting your maximum weight at 165 pounds. If I go over it, you'll send a guy to my house with a flamethrower or something? No, I'll send a guy to your house and cut off your wife's little finger. You kill me. - Have a good day, Dick. - Take it easy, huh? Cut off my wife's little finger. Sorry to keep you waiting. I think a toast is in order. A toast is in order. OK, no throwing the glasses in the fireplace, though. - We don't want to wake Alicia. - The ladies are entitled... The ladies are entitled to throw glasses in the fireplace. To quitters incorporated. Quitters incorporated. Quitters incorporated. To quitters incorporated. Beat it! Go on! Scat! Go on! Scat! Come on, Darcy. It's gobbler time. Now you just sit right there. Gobblers is all that Darcy eats because it's her mostest, mostest favorite. Listen to me carefully. It's still looking for me. You've got to get back and find it. You're my only chance. You're my only chance. - Lucky night, Mr. Cressner. - Don't jump to any conclusions. The night ain't all lucky. - Good night, Mr. Cressner. - Good night, sweetheart. - Richards! - Yeah, boss? - Cash these. - OK. You got it. - Buona notte, Mr. Cressner. - Buona notte. Buona notte. Oh, so nice, Mr. Cressner. Thank you. - Good night, Mr. C. - Good night, Henry. - Hey, have you spoke to Ducky? - Yes, sir, Mr. Cressner. He's got my wife and her friend in view? Yes, sir, she and the tennis guy are in a white mustang convertible. Ducky's right on 'em. He's right behind 'em. Good, good, good, good. Good man. So, folks, what's it gonna be? Dean Martin's at the golden nugget, and I haven't seen Dino Martino since I was a little girl. Have you taken care of your domestic problem? - I got everything well in hand. - Good. The golden nugget will be fine, OK? - Oh, good. Thank you so much. - OK. Let's go. Oh, my gosh. Look at that... a cat. You know, my daddy used to say that all cats should be drowned, after they stop playing with spools and stuff? Is that what your daddy said? Your father must have been a great humanitarian. Oh, my gosh, I bet that cat's gonna get run over. I got 2,000 says he can make it. - You're kidding? - No. - You're on. - 2,000 that he can make it. - Cat's dead. You're on. - Here you go. You say he makes it, I say he's dead. - Yeah, all right. - I can do anything I want? - Sure, so can I. Anybody can. - I can do anything I want? - You won't say a word? - Go ahead. Yeah. - You got it. Watch. - Anybody can do anything they want. - Watch me. - I'm watching. Come on, cat. Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty, kitty. - You guys would bet on anything. - Yeah. That's what it's all about. Come on, kitty, kitty. Come here, little kitty. - Come on, little kitty. Come on. - Come here, kitty. Come here, kitty. - For 2,000, you're on my side now? - Yeah. You're the one whose father was drownin' cats, remember? - Come on, kitty. Come to mama. - Come on. kitty. Come on, kitty. Don't worry about these big things. That's special effects. - Come on, kitty. - Here, kitty. OK, OK. OK, OK. OK, OK, OK. OK! Now! Come on. - Come on! Come on! - Come on! - Come on! - Come on, kitty, kitty. Hey, there he is. There he is. Yeah, there's the guy. There's the guy. Look at him. He was just lucky. Lucky? I think he knows you bet against him. You win some, you lose some. You guys go on. Go see Dean Martin. I'll take this guy home, give him a bowl of milk. I think he just earned it. - Good-bye, sweetheart. - You sure you're not coming? I got to finish that business I was talking about. Right. OK. - You wanna get me a cab, please. - Have a good time. Get Ducky on the radio. Tell him to nail the bastard. Good night. Thanks. Thank you. I still don't see why you can't come with me. Because we're broke. If you decided to leave with me, you'd be sent into a whole new plane of financial existence, my dear. I'm just trying to... make the decompression as painless as possible. - I don't care. - But I do. The Armbruster Hotel in New York. - I'll see you there tomorrow night. - Johnny... I've got to wait till the banks open, so I can crack open one of my piggy banks to get us some money. We gotta have something to live on. Look, Johnny, you don't know how dangerous he is. - You don't even have a clue. - I know exactly what he is. And that's why you're getting on the bus, after you give me a kiss. All passengers bound for Philadelphia, New Hope, and Harrisburg, please report to... - Johnny. - Go. All passengers for Philadelphia... Hey! It's for horses, sometimes for cows. Pigs don't eat it 'cause they don't know how. Get him. Get his keys, Dom. Come on. You're in grade-A trouble, buckaroo. Come on. Move. Move! Come on. Come on! OK, blow. - Come on, kid. - Hey! Pigs don't eat it 'cause they don't know how. When Ducky says that, it means shut up. - Does it? - Yeah. It's like a joke, you know? Close the door, close the door. I've set you up, Mr. Norris. In 10 minutes, Albert will call the police and tell them a tale of heroin, 1970 mustangs... aging tennis pros with drug records. You'll be eagerly sought after, Mr. Norris. Unless I tell you where Marcia is. With you gone, she'd come back. She's got nowhere else to go. Now as for you, when you get out of jail... you'll be more concerned with your arthritis than your libido. Unless you take the wager I'm offering. Hmm? Hey, come here. Come on. I want to show you something. Now look down there, and tell me what you see. Look. Go ahead. - The street. - No. There, there. The ledge. - The ledge. - Look, what is all this about? The wager I'm proposing is very simple. The top of the building is sort of an architectural monstrosity... All little nooks, crannies, weird winds. You walk all the way around, scab will be removed from the car, you get the money, and you get my wife. You're crazy. Lose your balance, lose your balance once... That's the bet, Mr. Norris. You get the girl, you get the gold watch, you get everything. Or you get a lot of straight time in Rahway Prison. You welsh on your bets? I've never welshed on a bet in my life. Hey, Sebastian. Hey, Sebastian. Sebastian appears to like you. Maybe that's a good sign, huh? Huh? Good. Good. Well begun is half done. The ledge is about 5 inches wide. But once you're on it, it looks more like 3, doesn't it? Or two. two, yeah. One? How the hell would you know? Mr. Norris, you know what I think? I think you're gonna just stand there for a while, then climb back up, huh? I mean if your arms still got the strength left to do that. I... don't think you got the guts. I just don't think you got the guts. Boogie! Boogie! Boogie! You bastard! I just want to keep you on your toes. Ha ha ha! Oh, get out of here. Boingo. You bastard! Just keeping you on your toes! Oh, Jesus. Hey, what's the matter with you? Knock it off, huh? Where's your sense of humor? Hey. Buzz off. Hey! Shove off. Ow! Ow! Oh! God. Oh, God! Ow, you little pecker. Try this, you... You flying shithouse. Mr. Norris! What do you think, Mr. Norris? Is this more fun than human beings should be allowed to have, or what? - I'll kill you! - No, Mr. Norris. But I will most assuredly kill you if you don't get moving in 30 seconds. The valve was only half-open that time. If I open it all the way, I'll blow you out of this hole. Move! I'll kill you. I'm going insane. Oh, God. God! God! Put it in the shopping bag. - On top of the money? - Put it in the shopping bag. Put that down. Now you come in when I say, "all right, all right, Mr. Norris." You got that? - Yeah, I got it. "All right, Mr. Norris." - No, no... "All right, all right, Mr. Norris." - I got it. "All right, Mr. Norris." - Forget it. Go ahead. All right, all right, Mr. Norris. I told you I don't welsh. - No? - No... I'm just an extremely poor loser. I promised you three things... You have your car clean, you have the money, and, of course... You have my wife. Jesus! How do you like that, Mr. Norris? God! Albert! Albert! Albert! Shit! Shit! The money... Nothin'. Nothin'. Chicken feed. I can get you a 100,000. 500,000. A million, Norris... In a Swiss bank account. How about that? How about that? A million dollars. I don't think so. Two million. Two million! No. I got an idea. I'll make you a little bet. It's not a wager 'cause I'm not a big, fancy hood like you. I'm just an over-the-hill tennis bum... with a dead girlfriend. Now, it's just a simple little bet. Five million. Five million, huh? I'll give you... I'll give you anything you want, huh? You're right, Mr. Cressner. This is a lot fun. You got to be joking, Norris, come on. It's a joke. Tell me it's a joke. Tell me it's a joke, for Christ's sake! Don't shoot! Just keeping you on your toes, Mr. Cressner. Keep moving. The next one might be a lot closer. Move! Norris, you son of a bitch! Hey! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Ohhh. Don't splash daddy when daddy's got the hose. Come on, you two. Lunch time. Let's get some of that soap off. A cat! Hey! Can we keep it? Can we keep it? No. He probably belongs to somebody else. Amanda, wait till I get a broom. Amanda, wait a minute! Amanda! Amanda, don't touch that cat. It could bite you. He's not gonna bite me. It likes me. I want to keep... No, don't! Amanda, we can't keep every single stray that comes into this house. - It could have disease. - What if we have the vet check him? If the vet checks him out and says there's nothing wrong with him and no one comes to get him, then can we please have him? Please? Pretty please with sugar on top? What's your name? I can't hear you. Gonna guard me? Hope so. But, mom, can't General stay in my room tonight? - No. - Please? No. His trial lease in this house does not include bedroom privileges. - But, mom! - Come on, now. Bedtime. Oh, mom. Good night, General. Amanda, would you turn off that TV set? I'd like to talk to you. That cat was in your bedroom last night, wasn't he? Uh-huh. I found cat hairs all over your bedspread, and a lot of your dolls were knocked over. Was he? I dreamed he was. Far out. Yeah? Well, he's really gonna be far out if that happens again because I'm gonna send him to the animal shelter. But, mom, you can't do that! That's not fair. Have you given one minute's thought to Polly? General loves Polly. They get along great. Birds and cats do not get along great, in case you haven't watched Sylvester and Tweety Bird on television. General wouldn't do a think to hurt Polly. He's nonviolent. Well, I think it's really early to decide that, and I just wish you'd understand. Also, your mom just happened to have a conference call with Nana last evening. And Nana told your mom that... cats steal kids' breath. Why would General take my breath if he has his own? You have to put all the animals outside in the night, I mean, especially the cat animals. Because if you don't... they climb up and sit on your chest and suck all your breath out like this. - That is very, very helpful, Hugh. - Thank you very, very much. Come on. Sit down and have your breakfast. No! No. Jokes about my mother's accent in the morning just have this way of killing my appetite. Nonviolent, my ass. Mom. I'm sorry we laughed at Nana. - But couldn't you... - No. The subject is closed. Bus in fifteen minutes. - Mama, can't General just stay with me... - No. No. Don't forget those back teeth. That's where most of the food gets stuck. Get the back. Hi, doll. Hi, daddy. You know, Amanda, it would be a lot easier for me to get General back in the house if I knew what these bad dreams were all about. Why? Why? Because when you play the violin, little girl, everybody listens, including your mom. So, come on. Tell me. Well, I can only remember that there's a monster in it. A monster? What's he like? Do you know that story about the goats? - The Three Billy Goats Gruff? - That's the one. Well, this one lives in my wall right there. But General kept those dreams away last night. Can't he come in for good, daddy, please? You know, Amanda, your mom is really serious about this. Yeah, I know. Just like getting your back teeth. That's where all the food gets stuck, and cats stealing kids' breath. Well, my making fun of nanny's accent at the breakfast table this morning probably didn't get us off to the best of starts. But I might be able to bring your mother around. No promises, but maybe. No promises. You know, Amanda... there are no real monsters. Yeah. I guess I do. OK. Go to sleep now. - No bad dreams. - No bad dreams. You know, I think she was beginning to cry when I kissed her good night tonight. Come on, Hugh. What do you say we talk about it just a little bit more, huh? Hugh, I just don't trust that cat. - What was that? - What was that? I don't know. I'll go. General, is that you? Meow! Meow. Polly! Mandy? Polly's dead. - The monster in my wall killed Polly. - Oh, no. I knew it. I knew it! It's OK. I told you this would happen. Look at this! It's OK. It's OK. - She's convinced the cat didn't do it. - Yes, I know. She's convinced that it was a troll that got tired of living under a bridge and is now living in her wall. But she is 8, and you're 38. And that cat's tracks were on her windowsill in Polly's blood. Now, are you gonna take care of Polly, or do you want me to? Well, here he goes, killer. You know, I would have thought that you'd have cleared out of here by now, too. You know, your welcome's getting pretty threadbare. Hmm? Come here. What have we got here? Who did that to you? Hmm? Hey, the cat's got a wound on his shoulder. - So what? - I don't know... Seems like a big wound. Yeah, well, Polly got in one good peck before that cat killed him. Good for Polly. Uh-huh. I certainly never realized that Polly had such a... big pecker. You know, you better get ready for work. You're gonna be late. You stay right there. Come on. Looky look. Good food. Come on. Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty. Mama's got your favorite food. Come on, you furry little bastard. Come on. Come on. OK. Going. Going. Your bird-killing days are over, my friend. General! General! General! General! Tomorrow's your big day, fella. Do you think General ran away because you thought he killed Polly? Honey, cats don't think. General does, and he knows that you think that cats steal kids' breath. Blech! Hey! What was that? Mommy! - Mommy! - Amanda! - Get out of my way! - Amanda! - Amanda! - Amanda! Amanda! Amanda! Get him, General! Get him! Oh, no! Come on! Don't let him get away! Please! Amanda! Mommy and daddy. We're not angry. Hugh! What is wrong? Why won't this door open? Come on, General! Get him! Uh-oh. No! Come on, General! You can do it! Cream him! Cream him! Watch out, General! Watch out! Come on, General! Amanda! General is fighting the monster! Amanda! Play it faster! - Play it faster! - Every breath you take Every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I'll be watching you... General! Amanda! Where did he come from? Where did he come from? Give me that cat! - Give me that cat! - Quiet! It wasn't General that was trying to take my breath! It was the monster... and General fixed him! You've gotta believe me! Amanda, where did it go? General played him on the record player and swoosh! Zoom! Into the fan and got smushed. - Oh, my God. - Yuck. Hugh, what do you think it is? That's where he came from. Right there! Right there in my wall, just like I told you! Amanda, whatever it was that was in the wall, was... was it alone? I mean, did it have any friends? I only saw one. Hugh, we're not gonna tell anybody about this. Are you kidding? Amanda, promise me... promise me that you won't tell any of your friends about this, OK? - Well, that depends. - Depends? Depends on what? On whether or not I can keep General and sleep with me at night. Amanda! That's blackmail. Hi. I didn't know I was under your spell I couldn't know There was no way to tell I took the step I slipped up and I didn't know why Deep in the dark, it was too hard to see That in the night, it had come over me You stole my soul Imprisoned me with your cat's eye - Cat's eye - How you caught me unaware - Cat's eye - How you hold me in your stare - Cat's eye - Going to hide, but tell me where? - Cat's eye - You've got me spellbound! - Cat's eye - How you stole my breath away - Cat's eye - How you kept me night and day - Cat's eye - I can never get away - Cat's eye - I am spellbound! It's like a dream, only when do I wake? Can't even scream Every breath that I take Belongs to you What can I do? Why should I try? I walk around like a boy in a trance You pull the strings I'm a puppet, I dance You're holding me eternally In your cat's eye - Cat's eye - Took my heart with just a look - Cat's eye - Every stare is like a hook - Cat's eye - Just one look is all it took - Cat's eye - You made me spellbound! - Cat's eye - How you stole my breath away - Cat's eye - How you kept me night and day - Cat's eye - I can never get away - Cat's eye - I am spellbound!
