How's the pill? They say if you take it, you'll feel better, although it makes you drowsy. But if you rely on it too much, it'll get harder later on. Yeah. It just stopped. Is construction a go or no go? Ah, you're up. You must have dreamt last night, because you talked in your sleep. Come and eat. By the way, I changed my glasses. What do you think? Do they suit me? I still can't sleep that well since that day. How can you be so fine? We hit someone. Don't you remember anything? Ji-min. What are you talking about? When did we hit someone? Honey, let's turn ourselves in. Ji-min, why are you doing this? I'm a bit concerned about you. What on earth did you dream about? (Deja Vu) - Beat it! - You got it! Look at you, my friend. Why did you raise your voice? - You're so mean. - My bad. Please keep quiet, both of you. - Too noisy. - Fight outside. We're not fighting, detective. Come over here! Write up a statement, - each of you. - Dong-woo. Did you get my pen? What's wrong? Hey. - Are you losing your mind? - I still have a hangover. - Sober up, dude. - Sir. There was a car accident. Go to the Traffic Accident Investigation Squad to handle it. That's not what I mean. Someone was hit. Why does something like this happen when I'm not around? Jeez. - Do it right! - Yes, sir. Where is it? Woo-jin. A phone call for you. Seon Woo-jin speaking. What? The police station? This is a real deer. Did you hit this by accident? Yes, on the way to the hospital with her, I took my eyes off the road and hit this deer. I was so stunned that I couldn't report it. And I heard you get fined if you kill an animal with your car. So I put the deer in my car and left. It doesn't look like your wife can't distinguish a person and a deer. She's my fianc√©e. Since she started to take psychiatric pills, she's been going through hard times. She looked scared and said she saw and heard strange things. I'm a lot worried too. You can take the car for further investigation. Let me ask you again. Was it really this deer that you hit on that day? Yes, that's right. I'll accept the punishment for that. You don't get punished for hitting a wild animal. She looks lost. Take her to the hospital first. Shoot, let's go. There's something going on. What do you think? If we dig, something will come up. Yes, go ahead. Bring the deer. How can I bring it by myself? You wanted to dig! Just bring it! I said so, as they look strange. No doubt! She's under the influence. Wait for me here. Mr. Seon? This is for you. Why don't you see a doctor? I'm leaving. She's a bit out of her mind, isn't she? I gave him Hyun-seok's business card to send him a new patient. I'm sure you feel the same. Woo-jin, give him a call. Hey! Did the detectives send you here? Yes. Symptoms including hallucinations and hearing things after a traffic accident are common for sensitive patients. It's the action from your brain to protect itself. Don't worry too much. Constant medical treatment will help you get better soon. What's wrong? Is it still hard? No, I'm fine. I don't know why my eyes are watering. Dr. Choi. Is there any way speed up recovery? Don't worry too much and just receive steady treatment. That's the best way. Please get sleep treatment. Because the detectives sent you, I'll pay more attention to her. Nurse Lee? (Dr. Choi Hyun-seok) Could you do me a favor? I think you could do me a favor. Did you buy a new car? What about the last one? I urgently changed it. I thought you were reluctant to ride the previous one. I want you to refresh yourself. This white car suits you. Let's go! (Doctor) Doctor? Who's that? Why don't you answer it? No, I don't have to answer it. By the way, how was the sleep treatment? You look refreshed now. Yes, I think I got better. By the way... - was it a real deer? - Hey! The police also said no! So please stop it! Sorry I lost my temper, but what we saw on that day... I'm sorrier for suspecting you. The doctor says you'll get better soon if you eat well and get steady treatment. Maybe if we live together... Stop repeating yourself. Why don't you propose to me? When you're so blunt like that, it embarrasses me. I wish you'd change it too. What? When did it become like this? - But you bought it for me. - Just do it! Please! When are you planning to make some big money? Don't you think repaying principal and interest to investors every month, is a waste of money? Knock-knock. Mr. Ju! Boy, Mr. Ju! Hey, get out now! Get out of here right now! Ms. Shin, I heard you haven't been well lately. Are you alright? Mr. Ju, what brings you here so suddenly? If you're okay, I want my black coffee. Do they invest time and money in their employees? Funny, they spend the investment to take care of urgent problems. He looks like a gangster too. He must have invested his money because of her. That's why he comes here every day. Look at those debt letters piled on her desk. I feel sorry for her whenever she gets a call from the debt collectors. Hey! We have dinner tonight. What are you waiting for? Why are you acting perverse these days? Mr. Ju is going to treat us to dinner. I'm not feeling well and I also have some work to do. She always says she can't handle her drink. Don't keep asking her to drink together. Got it. We'll go first to grab seats. We'll call you after. Answer the phone! - Let's go! - Okay, let's go! Let's go! Money is the best. But you should take care of your health too. Got it? I'll call you later. Who is it? - Honey, where are you? - I'm home. Can I go there now? You don't need to ask me. Just come whenever you want. Why are you speaking like that? What's going on? Nothing. I'm leaving now. Okay, come quickly. Who is it? You were in all-black today. Why are you doing this to me? You want me to go there now? When a woman goes alone, you always have to be careful. There are a lot of jerks. What the heck! Hey, what do you see? You look like you've seen a ghost. It's too late. It's rainy, so go home right now. Ghosts tend to appear on rainy nights. That figures. You didn't bring an umbrella. Honey! How did you get so wet? What if you catch a cold? How is it? Good? Why? Have you had a bad day at work? I'll get you a towel. Hello? When I got to your office, nobody was there. How did you get my number? I said I'd be there. Why didn't you wait for me? Do I have to do as you tell me? You played with my emotions to persuade me to invest money. Now you got the money? How much money you got in your account? I'll check it today. Who was it? Ju Do-shik? He wanted to make more money, so I introduced him to you, then... Stand still. Ju Do-shik is so terrible. Tell me if you can't stand him. Whoever bugs you or me, I'll have them all punished. I don't know how much she lost, shoot. She says nothing. I just keep in touch with her to check. Am I a stalker? Why are you doing this to me? We were great before. The atmosphere is chaotic, so hang on a little longer. Don't call us. Don't get cold feet, dude. Pay up already. (Reference Room) Chief, why don't you... Chief, did you see it? A few days ago, I came to work a little earlier. I saw something black that looked like a ghost. - Eun-mi and Gyeong-tae saw it. - Enough of your nonsense. Construction sites are said to be haunted by ghosts. Rumors like that will make it hard to sell. Stop talking nonsense and go and work! This is the fourth cat found this week alone. Ju Do-shik must be kidding so he can have the upper hand. Is there something we should do? They'll take care of it, so never mind. A police officer was here. I said you were out of office, but he wanted to ask you something. He asked me to look around and wait for you, so I said okay. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing here? Police? Ghost? Is this a playground? Don't ever ruin the working atmosphere! You are limping, so you had nothing to do. But I gave you an opportunity. Then you should cover for me! It's your routine work, isn't it? Get up, damn! Sit down. Hyeon-gu, no. My friend. Let's do good work. What would the boss think of me if he knew about it? It's like stabbing me in the back. I have to go up and drag you, so you can be a site manager, you know. Hey. Get out of here quickly. Yes, mother? Mr. Seon. The cop who was here before was you. I'm sorry. I'm busy all the time. Why didn't you come upstairs? I didn't come here for that. I just wanted to get your confirmation. On that day, it was a deer, right? I should have taken care of you. I was pretty tactless, right? But, you're so busy. So have dinner with your team and let's get it over with. I have an appointment, so I'm leaving now. Buy the way, I'm seeing the doctor, you introduced to me. He's very good. Thank you. Hey! This is very famous sushi. Try some. You didn't eat, did you? It's so good! Hey! She's fox-like. She's a pro. Hey, why don't you eat some? I bought it for you. What is this? Wow, is it like a surprise gift? You have no money to buy this. This is so expensive. It suits me perfectly. So what should I do for you? There are a lot of papers. Loan, credit, bankruptcy? Don't look at others' personal information. Even so, it doesn't go away. A pretty girl. Hey! You'd better watch your back. Hey, they say they are gangsters. What did you say? I'd better watch my back? Hey! Hey! Officers, you're working so hard. What have you got? Or did you find anything else? Can I see the documents of the cars scrapped last week? Yeong-woong Construction? What, do you think I'm doing something bad here? We wanted to see the documents. Why are you so talkative? You gangster punk. We're legally licensed and pay tax while doing business. "Gangster punk" seems a little harsh. Damn it. The pot calls the kettle black. Shut your mouth, you punk. Let's stop it today. We came here to check something. We'll leave now. Please cooperate with us later. Cooperate? Do I need to cooperate with you? What if I don't? I don't want to do it. You bastard! Don't lose your temper. (New apartment construction) Play somewhere else! Naughty brats. Why? You're here for room 704? The site manager of Yeong-woong Construction? Are you already done moving? No. It' so close. You can't really call it moving. Good morning. He must have saved money. I can't tell you everything, because of privacy. Keep it going! Ji-min! Ji-min, did you take your pill? I saw a man over there. On the veranda. Nobody can come here. It's okay. You're with me now. Ju Do-shik. Ju Do-shik came here. It's okay. I'm here for you. Let's get up. Yes. Please increase the dosage. She received no benefit from the medicine. To prevent it from becoming a trauma, you should be treated constantly. You got it? We need to talk. Stop for a minute and listen to me. I saved the money to spend when we get married. Don't feel pressure. I also put my apartment in our names. You can borrow money from bank if you're short of cash. When we get married, I planned to put my house in either both our names or in your name first. Are you proposing to me now? I mean, pay your debt and quit your job. Then you don't need to see Ju Do-shik anymore. My mother wants to have dinner together. Tonight on the 15th floor of Novell View. Please let me know in advance if you can't make it. If you can make it, dress up to try and stand out. Hey, Shin Ji-min! What time do you think it is? What, a letter of resignation? Do you think you can leave here at your own discretion? Do you know how much money you have taken from the company? 296,047 dollars. Let me check it out first. Hey, the PC! The PC you broke! Hey, Shin Ji-min! I'm counting money. Where are you going? Come here! Hey, Shin Ji-min! Hey, Ms. Shin! You haven't eaten anything, right? This is from a famous bakery. Try some, it's delicious. Hey! Why? Does Yoon-cheol want you to leave here? Damn it! Worse things will happen next time. I'll kill you. The steak is so good. - Mother, what do you think? - Delicious. It's worthwhile to have a son. I don't see anything I like. Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom. Who is it? Who is it? What time is it? Let's go outside and talk! You drank a lot. Ms. Shin, let's... Here, it's for you. Hey! Stop it and come here. Let me look at your face. You got so nervous and whined. Why do you pretend not to know? Mr. Yoo has been there. That means to do it. Let me make some money. What time is it now? What are you doing here at this time of night? Hey! Deer. Ji-min, are you okay? Are you hurt? I'm leaving now. Ji-min, take your medicine. No. Bad things happen whenever I take this medication. No, that's why you're taking medication. - I'm begging you. - No, I said no! (New Multi Housing Project) Welcome. What do you have in mind to do with the container boys? Why are you killing the clock? Everything will be settled tomorrow. Tomorrow? I already gave you money. Why tomorrow? Yes, Mr. Ju! I'm ready to sign the contract. See you soon. I heard the cops come in and out because of the car accident. No, it has been already settled. Hold it for me. Listen up. I'm not telling you to build a building now. There are so many people who can do that. You want to move up in the world? Cut off anyone who drags you down first. Otherwise, you'll be dead first. You lazy bastard! Why? You can't do that? You want me to cut them off? No. I can do it! Who you are is the next question. [VIU Ver] Deja Vu - Îç∞ÏûêÎ∑∞ -‚ô• Ruo Xi ‚ô•- Damn it, he's here again. Detective, you have no cases? Not busy at all? Why do you keep coming and bothering an upstanding citizen? You must know Seon Woo-jin Seon Woo-jin from Yeong-woong Construction. I have no idea. Just leave. You stink like cops. Just leave here, okay? Do you know him? No. Do you have your seal? Hey, this is for you. Take this. By the way, you really don't know him? You don't have the guts. I don't know how you've lived as a gangster. That's none of your business. Now the matter is settled, so let's disappear. Don't call me anymore. Okay, let's not contact each other. But be careful. Since the cop knew your name, they will annoy you. You must have not bought this because you were busy. Put the ring on Ji-min's finger. It'll fit perfectly. This is the last present I'm giving you. Don't you think I'm good now? I prepared this for you. I'll leave money for the ring. Do you really need to do that? Actually, I hate you so much. You know what. He's neither good nor bad. You just don't like him. As soon as you get out of here, you'll be dead if you show up. You're a jerk from this moment. Even if you fail, I have nothing to do with it. Honey? What are you doing here? How did you get in here? I came here because I wanted to see you. You said you wanted to see me and gave me the address. Then who was it? Who was it? Who sent me here? Lie down! Do you remember this? You must be familiar with it. Why don't you take this later and play with me first? What do you think? It's okay. It will be over quickly when you take it. You take medicine every day. Stay back. Good! That's why I like you! I don't like easy ones! Damn it. Oh, my! You're home. Nice to meet you again. Is Seon Woo-jin here? What brings you here? He didn't come home yet. Let us come in. Come with us to the police station. Seon Woo-jin's mother is at the station. Ji-min. Mother. Last night, Ju Do-shik was found dead in the office of Seon Woo-jin. Seon Woo-jin is presumed to be one of the suspects. In order to locate Seon Woo-jin, we asked you to come here. Shin Ji-min. Where were you last night? Home. I was at home. People say after Ju Do-shik invested in you, he kept harassing you by using that fact. And Seon Woo-jin knew it too. That's right. But he's not the kind of person who hurts people for it. A while ago, you reported to the police that Mr. Seon did a hit and run and dumped the body. Do you still think Mr. Seon did it? By any chance... Do you still keep taking the prescriptive medicine? When you take that medicine, do you still have hallucinations? A few days before Mr. Seon disappeared, a lot of money was withdrawn from his bank account. That's because... before we get married, he told me to pay my debt. Hey! What did you say now? Say it again! Hey, what did you say? Because of you! How dare you say that after letting me lose my son? I trusted you with my son! How can you say that after letting me lose my son? She is the prime suspect, got it? There is no evidence. We can't lose her. Did we ever investigate with evidence? - I'll follow her first. - Got it. When you take that medicine, do you still have hallucinations? (Seon Woo-jin) Did you take this medicine? It would've been very hard. What do you mean? This medicine is to treat patients with serious illnesses. You can't even prescribe it this much. He hid the fact because of his social life. Mr. Seon has been suffering from an impulse-control disorder. He needs to be treated regularly. Ever since he was a child, I've treated him. Suddenly, I couldn't reach him and he never returned, so I was worried. He let you take this medicine. I don't know why. Doctor? Who's that? Why don't you answer it? No, I don't have to now. You're his fianc√©e. Did you ask his friends about what Seon Woo-jin was like? That belongs to Seon Woo-jin. Take it and get out. I'm sorry, but he won't be back here again. I don't want to talk about him. With Ju Do-shik... Did they fight? Seon Woo-jin and Ju Do-shik are all the same. What are you talking about? A little while ago, Ju Do-shik hit an deer by his car. Seon Woo-jin, that bastard. To drink the deer's blood, he came here early in the morning. How awful. The deer was still alive, but they enjoyed it. A deer? It was caught by a cop. Did you really hit this? Was it a real deer? The police also said no! So please stop it! He said he would make medicine. For some reason, he buried it in the yard. The police came and took it out. If you drink the blood of a wild animal or eat it, you'll be fined. Ji-min. Don't! Ji-min. You have already moved! Officer. He must have saved a lot of money. - Hey, mister! - What? Where does the cop live? Room 705, over there! 705? (Seon Woo-jin's office) (Seon Woo-jin's place) (Accident scene) Help me. My baby sister. She's like a daughter to me because I raised her. My parents died early. But you took her away. Jae-yi, Cha Jae-yi! You must have not known her name. Where is she? Do you know? Where is my baby sister? Honey. Honey, where are you going? What are you going to do? Honey! (Cha Jae-yi) It's okay. It'll be over soon, Ji-min. Ji-min. Are you dead? Are you dead, right? You're alive. You came here to drag me down to the end. Honey? Honey. Why did you do that to me? Stay back. Stay back. I can't stand the sight of you! Stay back! Stay back! Even if you destroy me like this, what's done cannot be undone. Then you... Why did you do that to me? Why did you try to ruin my life? I did everything you wanted. I did! I gave you everything I had, damn it! That ring... Ju Do-shik bought that too, you tramp. Hey, officer! Come and get rid of her. Then I'll tell you where the body is now. No. She's an accomplice. She helped me do it, so she has to die too. Can you die for me? I could die for you. Stay back! Stay back! Damn it! Stay back! Now you're the only one left. You... You're a cop. I was a cop. Where is Jae-yi? Was she alive? She must be there. Get up! Don't try to buy time. Get up! You should go first. Shin Ji-min! Shin Ji-min! Stop there! Where is she? Where? Where is she? Even if you didn't come to the police station, I would have found you somehow. If you'd rather let me find Jae-yi and beg for forgiveness‚Ä¶ No. I wouldn't have forgiven you no matter what happened. Where is Jae-yi? You don't know? You don't know? Hey! You don't remember it, do you? Don't you remember it? Huh? Hey! Don't you remember it? Don't you remember it! You're both the same. Jae-yi! Why are you barefoot? Sorry, I'm late again. I'm sorry I'm late again. I'm so sorry. I forgot I had a meeting with your teacher. Aren't you sick of saying 'I'm sorry'? I'm so sorry, princess. I'm not a princess! Please don't call me that. You're my brother. Don't act like my father. You're my baby sister. Don't act like my mother. By the way, where are you? I'm on my way to pick you up. On the street. I played hooky, why? Everyone... No. Anyway, buy me new shoes. The shoes are hurting me. They are uncomfortable. I guess you've grown some more. It seems like yesterday when I changed your diaper. Yeah. Jae-yi, Jae-yi! Cha Jae-yi! Help me. Please. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Jae-yi. I'm sorry. We must get out of here. Come on! Hey! I'm sorry. Breaking news. The construction site in Incheon collapsed at dawn today. Police officer Cha and three other people were buried at the scene. According to police investigations, one of the dead is presumed to have died from a drug overdose, and the case is being treated as a deliberate murder committed out of resentment. 10 days after death, one of the victims‚Ä¶ Hyun-seok! Let's protect Jae-yi forever! Of course, Jae-yi is my sister, too. I can manage on my own.
