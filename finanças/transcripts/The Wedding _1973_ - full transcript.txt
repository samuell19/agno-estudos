It's good. But my feet swelled so much. Going around, constantly. Here the municipality chases, there the others. You walk into a street where you'd make a good sale, you see two guys already there, located well. They cast black looks at you. Let's count it, before getting cleaned. -Sister, are you fine? -Yes. I've prepared salty water for your feet. Without you, how would I live? You count, then. I'll treat my feet. Brother, will this job make any good? Yusuf goes to school, he'll keep going. We work, five of us, but it's not enough to feed us. Girls make 175 TL a week, and we have 30 TL profit here. I can work too, brother Halil. You are Yusuf, the youngest of us. Are your 5 siblings unable to afford your education? No way. Have your education, and rise to fame. Be the jewel in our crown. Never work, if you don't prefer. Get your own way! Sister, food! What's it? Check yourself. Stuffed meatballs! Should I call you sister or mom? As she's our sister, we can call her "mom" as well. Is it fair to make me cry now? Never again. -Have a blessed meal! -Welcome Uncle! Just break this. You're late. Yes, I'm late. People of İstanbul is kind of weird. This is tea, man. Don't you drink it, because the weather is hot? Couldn't you sell it? There's a yarn merchant at Valide Han, an Armenian. I told him, "If you don't buy the tea, I throw all the packs down and leave, I swear." Did he buy it? He must have, inevitably. İstanbul is a jungle alike. Not a sea of trees, but a sea of people. Do you think it's easy to break through the sea of people? Bravery abounds in here. Not easy, apparently. Yet, there must be some room for us as well. I have the responsibility for 5 siblings. May God bless you, you wrote us, guided us, then we moved here. I'm not sure if I did well. May God have mercy on your father, he was my elder. Uncle is meant to be fatherlike. Yet, what can I say? There's nothing to say, uncle. My father's shop was sold in auction. No land, no craft, no capital was left. If we didn't move here, we'd move Adana, Antep, İskenderun... No room in those places, too. Shall we go back to Urfa? My brother, my Halil, Is that you who told this? What is "going back"? Within İstanbul's land, no place is left for us to step, isn't it? İstanbul has space for much more people. Yet, it takes a lot of guts. We have the guts, with God's help. When you work with all your honesty and effort, you'll find a place to take root in this turmoil, it's for sure. Here we have İbrahim's feet, my hands, your wisdom, and the guts of Habibe and Cemile. You may not expect, but even Yusuf would be of use. Thorn bush of Harran is short. Yet, it's not easy to tear it off the soil it hangs on. I told what I have in my heart. I have nothing else to say. My Zelha sister is unique. There's nobody like Zelha. -You aren't late, are you? -It's time, sister. Habibe. -You take care of Cemile, don't you? -Don't worry. I always keep an eye on her. Go on. May God assist you. -He stares. -Never mind. Shall you come once again? It's hard at this hot weather. If we sell this one out, we'll blessed. This is a dead-end job, isn't it İbrahim? It is, sister. But, if there was a three-wheeler... A motorized one, do you know it? Its back is like a pick-up truck. Imagine a mobile shop. You cook stuffed meatballs, rice with chickpeas, you can sell whatever you want. Once you start the engine, you get to where the sales are. We would prosper, I swear. Yet, it calls for capital. Anyway, forget about it. Let's not be late. Good luck. God's blessings. Everywhere is dried up. There's no blessing. Summer is coming. Who minds a suit? A pair of trousers and a shirt, that's all. You'd better go after shirts. I mean... He would send a pack of 100 suits. It must be cheap now. It's for mutual benefit. It brings in well. Son, 100 suits make a deal of 20.000 TL. He has money and much stock. He sends, I sell. Good job. Good job. Dreams are all good. Let it be a dream. It can't hurt to try. Uncle Bekir, shall I bring your kebab? Yes, bring it. Brother Halil, shall I bring one for you, too? I'm leaving. It would be our compliment. No need. Thank you. It's not a month yet, since I come here. I don't know anybody. How would he know me? He lives in our hood. People get curious about newcomers. What do we have to get curious about? All have their own way. It depends. Maybe it bodes well. Goodbye. Uncle, kebab house ordered 3 portion of livers. Well, you prepare them. Sister! For each suit... For each suit... ...there is a hundred percent... ...there is a hundred percent trade. Bear it in mind. With my constant regards, Awaiting your prompt reply, I shake your hands, Halil Erkuş, right there. To Cabbar Ceylan. So you've passed! Well done! Kiss his hand, girl! He'll be a big gun. Write down. Write. Kavaflar Çarşısı, Kadayıfçı Müslüm Ceylan eliyle, Urfa. If I graduate high school, will you let me study further? Your school comes first, get all degrees possible. As long as we afford, with God's help. May you have plenty of fondness. Come this way. Put them on the food board. Who's that? -Good evening, brother Halil. -Good, there you go. -Thank you. -Let's come. Good evening, brother İbrahim. -Let me go. -Well, ok. He's busy. He works at club at nights. May I be excused? How come he knows me? He's a neighbour. A fellow townsman. -He's from Suruç. -What is this? It's a compliment, apparently. Neighbour's respect. Why? You're keeping on it. Let's sit and eat, before it gets cold. -I was in a rush, couldn't buy ice. -I can buy ice Uncle Bekir. You'd better do so, show yourself. I deducted expenses, 25 TL is left. Useless, brother Halil. I walked all day long for nothing. It's a must to buy a three-wheeled. You know it, don't you? It's a mobile shop indeed, bro. Once you offer a daily menu, it makes at least 100-150 TL per day. How much is it? What if you know its price, when you can't afford it? Come on, my nephew, there's no harm to know. Someone I know has a second-hand one. Not more than 15.000 TL. See? Rest is upon God almighty. How come is it, Uncle Bekir? Of course, it's upon God almighty. Whenever we get Cemile married. Get married? Bride price. Who will you marry? There's this boy, Yaşar. He's our townsman. As I said, he's from Suruç. So? So, he's not married. He's alone. He's far from his town. He works at kebab house by day, at club by night. He wants to get married. There's nothing to shame for it. And I thought about it. My nephews and nieces are in İstanbul, they're alone. I can ask them, I said. What kind of man is he? My brave sister... There's no bad man, if he's broke. You think so. Whoever has money, he's a good man. And we're bad. Is this what you mean? This child is weak. Yes, God's almighty. Yet, it's not fair to step on Cemile's shoulders. I do not consent. Sister. Don't let me go. I don't, Cemile. Why, sister? One day, however... Yes, one day... But, not today. We're poor now. He who gets marry to a poor, torments her freely. As long as I live, I won't let you condemned by anyone. Always for us... You left Ferhat for us, as well. Ferhat... Everything is away right now. Either our town, or its people. When we first saw Ferhat, we were with my sister. It was in the market place. When he saw us, he stood still and looked at us. He seemed petrified. And we walked through, getting our heads down. But, it seemed as if we were always there. My brothers didn't welcome him, but my mother approved. You were engaged. My beloved sister, you were as beautiful as an angel that day. It would be a great wedding. Our mother passed away same day. Before she passed away, she entrusted us, our brothers and our father to you. You've become our both sister and mother. You've been our leading light. You left Ferhat and followed us far from home. Always for us, you ignored yourself for us. Stop it! I convinced him for 17.000 TL. If it makes less than 150 TL a day, behead me. I need nothing. Neither water, nor bread. I'm not sure. -Cemile... -Well, keep your siblings, stay at home. Hope for it drops from sky. What else would drop from sky? It already did. See Uncle, it can't be less than 10.000 TL. And we go into debt for 7.000 TL. I pay the installments. We'll see. Yusuf's elder siblings envied him. They deceived him, took him to countryside, threw him into a well. They went back home then and lied their father that a wolf ate him. Later on, one of them delivered food to him. He noticed that a camel cluster was located at the well. Yusuf was taken out of the well. He returned and informed his siblings. They immediately went there. They claimed Yusuf as he was their slave and escaped. They bargained and sold Yusuf to them for a very cheap price. Yusuf was at a very young age back then. Fearing of his siblings, he kept silent. Having trust in God, he joined the camel cluster and went away. I was a kid. I was out with my grandma. When she saw the crowded of holy day at Halilrahman, she was surprised. "Colorful shapes are gathered," she said. That's right. A variety of people. There's no room only for us here, is it? There must be. Each of them tempted or renounced something, who knows what. Is it necessary to sacrifice something? Each of us will get marry someday. One of us should do something for the sake of family. Is the burden of whole big family left for a little kid? I don't know Zelha. You also did it by leaving Urfa for moving here. Leaving Urfa? -You mean Ferhat. -I mean nothing. You'll be late. Girls are about to leave work. -These are new arrivals, uncle. -Well. Leave them over there. How much? Tea is 90 TL, silk fabric is 160 TL. Tea is 70 TL, silk fabric is 120 TL. That's it. Anything else? You have the news, uncle. Yes, I have. Your issue will be settled. But, you'll expense. 10.000 TL. -As you wish. -Of course, I do. I'll give you an honourable bride. She's of our kin, speaks the same language. She cooks our local dishes just as your late mother once did. Her hand is tainted a little, you know, you saw. Yet, she kneads such a çiğ köfte, like silk, I swear. Also, 2.000 TL for me. That's it. Go, now. Get away! -By municipality. -Yes, that's right. Then you'll work easily. Vaccine and license is required. -Brother Halil has it. -Did you well with lahmacun job? So so, never mind. That's it, it's too hot. This morning I sold rice with chickpeas, near factory. When it gets hot, iced soda pop and muffin. How much did it cost? Well, with some supplements, 17.000 TL. Now heading to the park, you know, kids are there. I want skirt and blouse, a wool jacket and silk stockings. -Silk stockings? -Yes, everybody has it. -And you Cemile? -As you wish, sister. Sister Zelha. Brother Ferhat. Welcome. How is Urfa? Without you... We'll leave sister Zelha. We'll buy the meat, you'll pay for it later. Wait! You didn't intend to come. I work at intercity buses, Urfa-İstanbul. It was hard to find you. I'll serve, uncle. It will be 3 kg of minced meat. No fat. No tissue. Ok? You prepare it, as you know. Man says, "Habibi, ya habibi!" We say, "Habib." Ya Habibe! Without me, they all would be miserable. It's hard times. It's not the time to think ourselves. Yusuf will go to school. Habibe is grown up. Then Cemile... I didn't give birth, but I'm a mother, all their mother. Even if you are their mom, some day you'll notice that they're all gone. That's how it is. You torment yourself and me for nothing. We, two of us... We'll have kids, too. You leave, Ferhat. It's destiny. What are these, Halil? Nothing. Small gifts. For you all. -Why necessary? -That's how custom is, Zelha. What kind of custom is that? Who is that, out of the blue? It's not out of the blue, Zelha. Cemile will no longer work. -No way! -Zelha! No way! I won't give her! It's not fair. My Cemile is a kid yet. This is torment! Torment! I don't give her! I don't give her! I don't give her! I'll be the emperor to the land of İstanbul! See, Uncle. You'll see that I'll be the emperor. You know it, don't you? Yes, that's it. It has three wheels. This is a trivet. A trivet! I'll be here, there and everywhere of İstanbul. TRIVET HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE OF İSTANBUL Wait! Speak then. I thought you'd say something. Habibe! I don't know how to make long speeches. Will you marry me? I have my elder sister. I have my elder brothers. I want you, not them. -You're late. -Yes. We worked overtime today. My weekly wage. Come here girl, help us. Are you making a face to your brother? Never. Don't say so. It's from Cabbar. Thank you, nephew. Tomorrow is Sunday. You'll sell stockings, hankies, shirts. I got them cheaply. -Uncle, we'll sell soda pop tomorrow. -Man, you're a newbie yet. You do what I tell you. Sell them near New Mosque. If any left unsold, I'll shave my moustache. I bought them so cheap. Leftovers of a fire. -What do you think, brother? -Good idea. -From Cabbar. -He wrote, then. -Brother, let's don't be late. Sausage and bread. -Lodge them. "Find me at the hotel on Tuesday," he says. Hotel Ferah at Aksaray. "We can try it for 20 suits," he says. He convinced, apparently. It will be difficult. But, half the battle is won. Yes. Here you are. -Welcome, sister Zelha. -Thank you. -I cooked stuffed meatballs. Cemile enjoys them. -Thank you. -Does only she like them? -Enjoy your meal. I'll serve you a cup of tea. I've just brewed it. Well, if it's not a bother. Cemile... She's almost here. Long time no see, sister. It's been almost 2 months, nobody called us. I have no time to breath. Cooking 3 times everyday. Lahmacun, rice with chickpeas, sausage and bread, stuffed meatballs. What about sales? Good now, thanks God. I asked Cemile. Aunt Zehra went to pick her up, she's about to come. -From where? -From Şişli. She works for a decent family. How come? Aunt Zehra found the job. A very well, neat family. They have 2 kids. Cemile takes care of them. A day off every two weeks. Today it's first month. Did we give Cemile to you for this? Is she working for strangers? -Is it shame to work, sister? -It's not. Cemile worked at the factory. Yet, serving for strangers, is it fair Yaşar? She earns 75 TL weekly at the factory, sister. -Here she earns a full 700 TL monthly. -I'll take her and go. No way, sister Zelha. Her brothers are merciless. Bride price, wedding, etc. I paid 17.000 TL for Cemile. Once she pays this debt, she won't work any longer. They want her back at 7 p.m., I'll come and take her. Thank you, aunt Zehra. She'll be ready at exactly 7 p.m. Welcome. I don't consent you serving to strangers. Pack up and let's go. You heard. Pack up. No, sister. I'm Yaşar's wife. What if then? I'll talk to Hail. Brother Halil bought the three-wheeled. He won't step in this. Nobody steps in. Really? Sister! Sister! My dear sister! My beloved sister! It's useless to keep coming and turn the knife in the wound, Ferhat. I moved here. I found a job here, at a construction company. My uncle won't oppose. Half of the shop is mine, it's my mother's share. You won't work. You'll be the mistress of your home. Now that he is used to eat human flesh, he won't give it up. Human flesh? Human flesh. Your brothers consumed Cemile. Whoever battens on someone else, he eats human flesh. -It's not true, my brothers- -It's true. Now maybe it's your turn. Maybe Habibe, maybe Yusuf... Even İbrahim. Strong one survives. My brothers don't do so. They wouldn't, yes. But they tasted once, it's inevitable. My Zelha, it's nonsense, we'll be wasted. Yes, we will. Some live for others, it's their destiny. That's it. And I lived for you. I have waited. I'll wait. I have plenty of honey, as long as you sell. Isn't that 10% brokerage too much, uncle? My nephew, you have 250 TL trade in this short day. Why are you meddling in my revenue? Is trade possible without brokerage? Tell me that. -If you say so... -I say so, of course. Yusuf! What's up, my son? What's it, man? Did you have fight? I won't go there any longer. I'll work with you. What happened? Nothing. I'll come with you. Help me, then. Come on. Go on. What's it, sister? It's time to smile. Why are you making a face? I've been to Cemile's today. We couldn't ask after her so far, because of our own fuss. What happened to girl? Yaşar placed her to serve for strangers. She's poor, she's miserable. I'll talk to Yaşar and warn him. It's useless. Why would she get back to her brothers who sold her? Halil. İbrahim. You know Yusuf's story? His siblings had thrown him into well, to get rid of him. We've become them. We set a wedding table on the corpse of Cemile. We eat, drink and feel grateful. Is this meant to be siblings? Did we come from Urfa for this? Would we do this to each other? She used to say "Mom". Shame on me. I wasn't able to stop you. I wasn't able to take Cemile off your hands. Give me a muffin. Just out of the oven! Still hot! Here are sandwiches and bagels. Is there ayran? Come on brothers, here you are! Here are sandwiches and bagels. Bagels are crispy, brothers. Come on! Crispy bagels, brothers. Come on, bagels are still hot! Bagels are still hot! -Give me an ayran. -Of course, sir. Here you are. Here is lahmacun! Here is stuffed meatballs! These are gems! Here's lahmacun! Here's cold ayran! There you go, sir! Yusuf, serve him a soda pop! Come on sir, lahmacun or cold ayran? -You'd better get out of here! -Why? You're blocking our sales. Piss off! Does this land of İstanbul belong to you? Get away! I said piss off! Aah! Ahh! Move on! Run away! They stabbed him! Hurry! To the police! Halil? -Have you had a crash? -No, nothing. How come? Your clothes are covered in dust. Nothing. We had a small fight. Then? Yusuf, İbrahim? I said nothing. Give me a towel. Who did you fight with? Over the pier. There are vendors like us. What happened? Did you fight, too? -Yusuf! -It's okay, sister. Why have you arrived separately then? Something happened, you're not telling it. The guy was stabbed. -The guy? -Yes. -How come? -I don't know how. Brother Halil fell on us. I had knife in my hand. -It slid into him. -So, what will happen now? Nothing. We just run away. You run away! They will find you anyway. What if he dies? Tell me where he was stabbed. I don't know, I swear. We just run away. They must have noted the number of motor. Running away is nonsense. Best is to surrender. Cabbar would come tomorrow. We have 8.000 TL. debt for the vehicle. How would it be? Everything was settled. Okay. We're dead. We're all dead. Brother İbrahim. I stabbed him. I'll go to police. I'll say so. What? It's a lie! No way! Tell that it's a lie, İbrahim. -You said that you had the knife. -Yes. I had it. -But... -But what? -That's necessary, sister. Otherwise we're dead, he says. Is it up to you to die? You'll go to school. Yusuf! Step aside! You let that little kid go. It's necessary for the family, Zelha. Yusuf did it. Really? You sold Cemile. Now you throw Yusuf into the well. Yusuf! He's lying, officer! It's a lie! Believe me, I beg you! Yusuf! It's a lie! A lie! Yusuf! Yusuf! My Yusuf! My son! Is that right that you do? That you kill yourself? What did you tell them and they captured you? Did you say that you took the knife and stabbed? Blood didn't mess with your hands. Did you rub it on your forehead? It's a pity. It's a pity! It was necessary, sister. One of us would go. Blessings on my brothers and you. As long as you're in jail, my life is worthless. I won't let you stay here. -I'll go and tell them. -That's useless, sister. I told what I need to. I signed it. You'd better leave. Sister. Don't come again. No one comes. Send my books. Cabbar Ceylan. He must have arrived today. -Welcome Cabbar Agha. -Thank you. My uncle Bekir. You may know him. I left Urfa long ago. Take your seats. I remember you. He used to settle in front of your father's shop and drink tea. Still the same. How is Urfa? Never mind. It's quiet as a grave. Once it gets busy like a madhouse. -Then nothing for 2 months. If... -Did you bring 20 suits? Yes, let's have a try. You're good at smelling out. You know how it would go. Are they good? Good quality. -What's the price? -200 TL for each. Take them all. Fifty-fifty. I'll take 10 suits now. You'll see how it goes. My uncle can bring you us for the evening. No need, don't bother. You're deemed in a foreign place. You must dine on çiğ köfte. My uncle consents. He'll visit your family. -What if my brothers won't- -Who cares them? Don't say so. We love each other. It's not their concern. -It's our custom. -Never mind those customs. You focus on us. We testified. Date of the court is not set yet. Guy is well, he's not dead. What if he died? He's alive, thanks God. Come on sister, don't be sad. Look, I've made 1.000 TL in 2 hours. It's Cabbar's trade. There will be another 1.000 TL tomorrow. Now we can hire a lawyer. He would go to school. We didn't go to school, either. That's fate. Here, these are yours. I don't eat Yusuf's flesh. Brother. Shall we prepare for evening? We'll have a visitor tonight. Habibe, make some çiğ köfte. Not only clothes, we trade whatever there is. For example, recently... I bought 5.000 sheep. But I couldn't sell. They strictly control foreign trade. You ate all then. What can we do? We have plenty of neighbours. But loneliness is hard. I mean, the cloth issue is easy. There you go, Cabbar Agha. With please. Delicious. Texture is perfect. That's good. Enjoy the meal. Importing is easy. İskenderun. Consignment is of 1.000 suits. The port is under quarantine. Disinfect and send. What if you can't sell? We're merchants, man. I even weigh and sell you. I find a buyer for him. He refuses the visitation. -Tell him that his sister is here. -I told. Don't worry, I'll give him the books. Thank you. -You go back, Ferhat. -I will. It's hard to tell you something that you don't want to see. I thought you were a decisive person. I am. My siblings have nobody, but me. Only Habibe is left. And the others? The others are... Here you are. I heard you came here. I had heard your leaving Urfa without informing. We don't have to give an account to anyone. Clean work is fine. Are you here to travel? Like you. Exactly the same. -I work at a construction site. -Workers can't prosper. It depends. -Lots of people work. -Well then. You haven't wasted your time. If we talk about wasted time, we mean a lifelong period. Let's go. Thank you, daughter. We are deemed neighbours. But, we haven't had any contact other than shopping, yet. -That's our fault, of course. -Not at all. If it's possible, I've come here for an auspicious purpose. Sister! My dear sister! He told it. Would he approve? He would. Why wouldn't he? What if he does not? I'm not sure. I'm here. -Shall I pray? -Yes. My God... Thank you. Yes, I'm convinced. It will be good. It's good to come settle here. We can cooperate. But, it's hard. I have two kids. My mother is weak. She's unable to take care of two kids. It's easy to find commodity. -Can we sell 1.000 suits per year? -Sure we can. 1.000 or 1.500. There's a human flow to İstanbul everyday. Demand is high. Good. Let me think about it. I need to go. I'll get an order for you, before you leave. That's good. Let's do it. Goodbye. -You fired our youngest. -He was often breaking dishes. He'll get his deserved per diems. It's 50 TL. -What about the dishes he broke? -They're called "casualty". Give me 50 TL. It would be fine. But... The kids would be miserable. Who would take care of them? Bring them here Cabbar Agha. Uncle... Even I have my mother, it's hard to look after them. What would be here? We'll get you married. I have considered it when back in Urfa. You've touched a sore spot. I offered 100.000 TL bride price. Nobody agreed to give his daughter. God knows why, because of me or of kids. Why would it be because of you? You're strong. I know how our people are, they're jealous. Yes, they are. Here, we can find someone decent for you. Even not a stranger one. Halil's younger one. -The one with the scarf on her forehead? -No, her younger one, Habibe. The one who makes çiğ köfte. She speaks of your language. Cooks local foods, like your mom. She's young. You know her, you saw her. She makes such a çiğ köfte, like silk. You ate it. So? So, that is. I'll convince them. My brother has kept silent for 2 days. -The others? Aren't they talking about it? -No. Alright. -What if my brother doesn't approve? -It's his choice. I'll hold your hair and drag you away. -It's not moral. Brother's word is law. -Do you think so? Habibe, if you won't be mine, you won't be anyone else's. You mean the world to me. That's it. Zelha! Leave that stuff. No longer needed. That's over, sister. We won't sale food any longer. We've become merchants. Labour and hard work are not enough to be a merchant. Where's the capital? Thanks God, we have capital. We have a great partner. He's beyond partner, he is our groom. He supplied 40.000 TL bride price. Is that guy? Yes, Cabbar. -With God's consent... -Is that drunk? It's a lie! No way! No way! Brother, what have you done? I did nothing bad, Zelha. What's wrong with being a merchant? What about Habibe? What will happen to Habibe? -What about Zeki? -Stop it! Calm down Zelha! -We haven't promised anyone. -But they... They promised each other. Without asking for his brother's opinion, is it? Is this respecting the elder? Who is Zeki? Nobody. It's not clear if the shop belongs him. Cabbar is better for Habibe. He's great. He has lots of cash. Lots of possessions. Give up son. This trouble is not solved by drinking. Let them do. Is she the only one? Don't get into this, uncle. I'm drowning my sorrow. That's it, uncle. Leave me alone. We'll take care of him, uncle Reşit. Don't worry. So, the brother sold us, didn't he? Let it be. If she won't be mine... Lawyer told: "This is an accident, honorable Judge." "There's no hostility. He's young." Judge asked for you. I said, "He's sick." They delayed 2 months. Hey! Hey! Let me go! Let me go! This is Habibe. And I'm Zeki. The butcher. There will be an auction here now. He who gives best price will win. You can increase, if you have money. Maybe you win. Stay away! I'll hit! Any more increase? Sister Zelha. Is it fair? Is it? Give me the knife, Zeki. You're a decent man. Yes, I'm decent. So you are, sister Zelha. So he is. And you, too. This poor man is decent, as well. We're all decent. If we're all good, why is this happening? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? -What happened? -Habibe! -Tell me! They will give Habibe to Cabbar. Zeki is right. Maybe he does what I could not. He drags her with him. Why didn't I drag you with me? Did I respect you too much, or didn't love you enough? Ferhat, I'm not here to talk about it. I need to rescue Habibe. Is there a way out? Maybe there's one. We'll see. What will happen, Habibe? Tell me, what will happen? I'll tell you... I'll take you away. As I told you, I'll drag you with me. No way. -My brothers will not let me alive. -And me? When you're not mine? And what would I do in between two of you? Let me die. Let me die and be saved. This is my destiny. Many more like me were dead. Either of sorrow, of lover or of brother. No Zeki, no way. No way. Cabbar Agha has settled the business in Urfa. He says he would be here on Wednesday with 50 suits and 2 kids. Wedding is on Friday. -What about you? -I found a flat in Aksaray. But, rent is 1.200 TL monthly. -1.200 TL? -Yes. -Rent it. -It's too much, man. May God's greetings be upon you. That's God's greetings I have just offered you. May greetings be upon you, if it's what you want. There's nothing I want. I want to talk about Habibe. You can't name Habibe. Stop it and move on! So your boss won't cut your wage out. Zelha and I agreed. If you give Habibe to Cabbar- Get off our back! If I even see your shadow... Do you think you talk to your sisters? Step back or I will ... We're determined, we'll leave. -He means... -Nothing. -Zelha doesn't leave us. -If she left, she would do it in Urfa. He'll pay, I've asked him. But, I'll have 500 TL of it. You'll have 1.000 TL. You've supported us a lot. Uncle is meant fatherlike, nephew. Habibe! Habibe, your brother calls you. These are yours. There are much more, whatever you want. Everything is set. It will be a great wedding. The wedding table is on the corpse of Habibe this time, isn't it? Is this what was supposed to? Once you couldn't enforce nobody in this İstanbul jungle, it was easy to eat the flesh of your poor siblings, right? Is it fair what you're doing, Halil? Whatever I did, I did for your benefit. Who's left to see your benefit? You enslaved Cemile. You threw Yusuf into the well of hell. You throw Habibe's flesh to the dogs or give it to Cabbar. Only I have sacrificed myself voluntarily. I wanted to be the mother. But it proved of no use. I couldn't make myself useful. No, this wedding will not be happen, Halil. Not possibly, it will not be happen. No way! May God's blessings upon you. Brother? Our three-wheeled? Is it a car crash? We don't need it any longer. I sold it. Me? What about me, brother? You'll work with me. He sold it, İbrahim. He sold all of us. We checked everywhere uncle Reşit, we couldn't find him. They saw him near the garden restaurant this morning. Wedding? Check the wedding. It's not impossible. Let's go. I'll shut the shop down. No way. Habibe is there right now. They lied her on a wedding table. Harran's raptors are over her head. I am an elder sister. I'm a mother, Ferhat. Even only Habibe is left, I can't leave her and come with you. Forgive me. Sister Zelha! I knew it. My sister Zelha does not leave us. Welcome to our wedding, sister Zelha. You're wrong, Cabbar Agha. This is not the type of weddings you're familiar with. This one is our wedding. I've come to take Habibe. Habibe is my wife. It demands freewill. Her brothers offered her to your benefits. I won't let you abuse none of them, as long as I live. None of them! Cemile! Sister! My sister! You're wrong, sister Zelha. Woman can never be pulled back from me. I paid 40.000 TL. Nobody can take back what I bought. If you insist to take, you'll get her corpse. Try it! This can't harm me. I won't let you abuse my siblings. Go eat others' flesh, if you're capable of. We can keep up on our own. As long as we have our blood, sweat and tears. Sister... Don't leave me sister Zelha. I'll tell to the judge: "Yusuf is innocent." "I stabbed the man." THE END
