Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Retina... ...intact and normal... Optic nerve... Normal. Captain...you're a toss-up... You've responded satisfactorily to hospitalisation and medication... I think we've done all we can for you, here. It's my feeling you'd make better progress in your own environment... ...with familiar faces, than any hospital. Remember, Captain... You've had almost 2 years of Chinese prison camps. I don't need to tell YOU that "brainwashing" isn't just a word. Some of these symptoms 'll take time. The fatigue...the dizzy spells... ...the lapses of memory... How long, doctor? A few weeks...a few months... maybe longer. It depends on you. Remember, you can't push yourself too hard... Physically, or mentally. Do you understand, Captain? Yes. You're absolutely sure you've had no further headaches? Yes, doctor...I'm sure...no headaches. Good! Oh, Captain... Do you have a family? No. You're in the public relations business, I understand. Yes sir, that's right. Planning on getting back to it? I expect to. My partner's been carrying the load for me, since I was recalled for active duty. That's good...Let him go on carrying the load. For the first few months, anyway. Well...good luck, Captain Remember, Captain... If symptoms return... ...the dizziness, the headaches... ...report to the Pentagon infirmary... ...or the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, immediately. Sure. Thanks. - Thanks. - Not at all. It's simply amazing, this flying... I never get over the wonder of it. I suppose it's no novelty at all, to you. I did hear the hostess call you Captain Eaton, didn't I? My name is Gregory Jessop... Dr Gregory Jessop. Not in the medical field... ...but one I like to think will serve mankind equally as well. Nuclear physics. It must be good getting home again... Washington IS your home? Yes it was... But I'm not sure I intend to stay there. Plan to remain in the Service, Captain? No. And it's not keeping me any longer... I'm finishing my tour of duty. Well...congratulations! You know...our fields... the military and the sciences... ...they're closer together today, than ever before... I'm sorry to say. Sorry? I'm sure you must see... ...that science has brought us to the brink of world extermination. Were you in Korea? Yes...but it's not my favorite topic of conversation. Of course...well...I understand... Good to have that behind you. What was your profession before the Service. Public relations... public opinion polls... ...consumer analysis... industrial research. You know...our organisation... The Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Warfares... ...thinking of using a survey to backup our program... ...of ending the nuclear arms race... Calling a halt to the military invading our field of science. What did you say you called your company? I didn't...but it's "Eaton Baker Associates". I'm sure with your experience... ...you'd be in complete sympathy with our aims. As a matter of fact... ...I'm on what you might call "official business", right now. I'm going to a conference that's been called... ...to study the whole question of our space-missiles tests... ...our nuclear research program. I'm sorry, but I'm a little out of touch. I'm sure it won't take you long to catch up with things. In fact, you're just the type of person we need behind us. After all...public opinion must be the final judge. Yes, I'm sure. If you don't mind, I've had rather a rough day. Of course...go right ahead! "Sleep knits up the ravelled sleeve of care". But don't let Shakespeare or me keep you awake. May I offer you one of mine? No..I haven't had time to get used to those fancy filter tips yet. You will...get used to the filters, I mean. As a matter of fact... ...they're a splendid example of what we've been talking about. You'll find public relations has grown considerably... ...in the years you've been gone... Our scientists announced some disquieting findings... ...in the relationship of tobacco to certain malignant ailments... There's another job for public relations. The profession of mass-persuasion. But then I'm sure you've had considerable experience... ...with Han Taylor's statistics. Well, no...as a matter of fact, I haven't... You see, Clarke Baker and I ran a rather small 2-man shop. Our services were limited to the collection of opinions and facts... ...in the fields we found them for our clients. Not part of our job to change anything we found. I think you'll find, Eaton, that things have changed in your absence. Public relations, in the last few years... ...has come to cover a multitude of sins. ...or virtues... ...depending on your point of view. Would you fasten your seatbelts please... ...we're approaching National Airport. It's been an enjoyable trip. By the way... Do you have a reservation?... Do you have a place to stay in Washington? No...As a matter of fact, I plan to... Look here, look here... I'm going on to New York myself... Let me give you the address of friends... They run a little residential hotel. - It isn't necessary. - It's no bother. No trouble at all You'll find Washington pretty much the same as ever. If it isn't the tourists... ...there's a convention of one sort or another. I usually stay there myself... It's a quiet place... right in Georgetown. And they're fine folks. Give them my regards... ...and tell them you're a friend of Gregory Jessup. Thank you... that's very kind of you. Impressive, isn't it? I sometimes wonder if that French architect... ...ever realised that in laying out the design of Washington... ...with its circular streets and radiating avenues... ...he designed the perfect target! TWA Flight 54 non-stop jet-stream Ambassador service... ..from San Francisco... ...now arriving at Gate 5. Keep the change. I'll be glad to take care of this for you. Would you leave your number, please. May I help you? No, it's alright...I'm Captain... I'm Alan Eaton. Oh, Mr Eaton! - Well, can I tell Mr... - Don't bother... ...I want to surprise Mr Baker. Mr Baker?! Mr Eaton...I... "Truly yours...etc etc." Eaton! Alan Eaton, why,,, You old son-of-a-gun! Hoe are you?! That's all, Doris... Hold all calls. You are...? McGinnis...Jim McGinnis. You remember...I joined the shop just before you shoved off. Of course...I think I do remember. Well I wanted to talk to Clarke Baker... Which office is HE in? You want to talk to... Are you kidding? Are you on the level? Look...I know I've been away for quite a while. And I can see there have been quite a few changes made around here. But if you'll just tell me where I can find Clarke Baker... Where you can find him?! Clarke Baker's dead. Didn't you know? Hey...wait a minute... take it easy... I know how close you are... But I had no idea... I thought you knew! What happened to him? It's a shame... Dirty rotten shame!... Hit and run driver over on the Fesder Rd. Never caught him. They didn't tell you? No... No, they didn't. I didn't know anything about it. Hell, you gave me quite a turn. Well after all the Commie brain-washing we read about.. I thought that maybe you were... Now, look...don't get me wrong... I'm sorry that I'm the one that had to break the bad news. Well, Alan... What are your plans? I'm not sure, right now. I have a final physical exam to take... In any event, I... I won't be in shape to take over right away. Take over?! Are you kidding?! Now, look, McGinnis... I'm sure you must have done a good job here... And I'm prepared to make any arrangement that seems fair... But I want you to understand... You want ME to understand?! That's either a poor joke... ...or those Chinese Commies really did scramble your marbles. If you think that you can walk in here and take over... ...after Clarke sold out to ME... ...you really ARE crazy! Sold out?! What do you mean...sold out?! I mean that I paid hard cash for this business. Wasn't half the size it is today... ...thanks to new accounts I brought in. Are you asking me to believe... I'm not asking YOU to believe anything. You gave Clarke Baker power-of-attorney when you went back in the Service. I gave Clarke power-of-attorney to run the business while I was away... ...not to sell it. If you didn't limit your power-of-attorney, it's not MY fault. And don't blame me if Clarke used it... ...to sell the business without telling you first. And don't blame me if he wanted to play it cosy... ...banking on the chance that you wouldn't get out of Korea alive... ...to get your cut! You're lying! That's a lie! Get this maniac out of here, before I call the cops! Please Mr McGinnis... I'm sure Mr Eaton didn't mean to lose his temper. I don't know whether he's lost his temper, or his mind! Surely, Mr McGinnis... this isn't a matter for the police. No, alright, Barney. Maybe you're right. Now look... I don't like to throw dirt on a dead man... But you know how Clarke was... Maybe he had plans. Maybe he spent the dough. Or maybe he invested it... ...and planned on telling you and paying you later... ...and got killed before he could. Or maybe you knew. Maybe he wrote you. Maybe you...forgot. Where are the contracts?... I'd like to see the contracts. Miss Dennis, bring in the Clarke Baker file. It's nice to see you back, Mr Eaton. Barney Bond...our chief statistician... Clarke hired him before you left... Maybe you don't remember that either. Really, Mr McGinnis... You shouldn't... I shouldn't what?! He walks in here asking to see a dead man... ..accuses me of stealing the business... He roughs me up... Well I'm sure that Mr Eaton is just temporarily upset over Mr Baker... - After all... - Well I hope that's all it is... Because I thought for a minute, it was anything else... ...you know what I SHOULD do? I should call the army hospital... and have 'em come down and pick you up. There's nobody in their right mind, would pull what you just tried to pull. That's all, Miss Dennis. Well, here it is. Don't take MY word for it... look for yourself. You ought to recognise Clarke's signature. Who witnessed this document? Barney Bond witnessed the whole transaction. That's true, Mr Eaton...I did. Excuse me. Well, there you are, Alan... Any questions? Fire away. No...no questions. Now, look... We don't want to cause any trouble for each other...do we? No...of course not. And I don't want you to think that I'm giving you the brush-off... Because, I'm not. Far from it. Sit down. You see we kept the name Eaton-Baker Associates... Because YOUR name has some value... and I know it. Sure, we got some new accounts... some big ones. But some of them... like Senator Walder... ...we lost. He'd like to know that you're back with us. So, I'm ready to put you on a retainer. Name your own ticket. You know...give you a chance to catch up... Put you on your feet. What do you say? Thanks...I'll let you know, McGinnis. Got a place to stay? Anything you say, boy... I want to do the right thing. No hard feelings. No hard feelings. Alright, then... So much for the Jews... The way we handle the labor unions... Excuse me...I'm sorry. Mr Eaton... I'm sorry... I'm terribly sorry about... Miss Dennis! Bring your book. Senator Walder's office. I'm very sorry, but it will be impossible to see the senator. He's tied up in committee hearings today. I'd like to speak to Senator Walder please. Yes, you might try at the end of the week. Does the senator expect you? No...my name's Eaton ...Alan Eaton. I'm very sorry Mr Eaton... ...but it will be impossible to see the Senator without an appointment. Alan! How are you, boy?! - Hello Senator... - It's good to see you! - Come in! - Glad to see you, sir. You wouldn't believe how much red tape it took... ...to get you fellows back again. - I know. - Had your lunch? No, not yet. I wanted to talk to you for a minute, Senator... ...but I understand you're pretty busy. Busy? Not to YOU, Alan... Come along... We'll be in the Senate dining room. There's a lot I want to hear about. Well, Alan... From what you tell me, I'd say it's a pretty rough deal. But McGinnis is apparently within his legal rights. You're satisfied that the contracts are all in order? I'm afraid so, Senator. I was a bit concerned, when you left. Of course, I liked Clarke Baker, well enough... But he never was the businessman, that you were. Running around in that low-slung sporting car of his... Well, Alan... What are you going to do? I'd hoped to square away things with Clarke, here... Then pass my physical examination for discharge from the army... ...and head for California. Get some rest. Soak up some sun. Under these circumstances... ...I must admit that McGinnis seems more than fair. He's offered to let me write my own ticket. Wouldn't surprise me. He needs you, Alan... Make no mistake. How's that? That office looks a lot better now than it ever did when I had it. Sure it does! He's running with some pretty big fish. But they have a smell. Oh?! Alan...you know the public relations field... ...from the ground up... Legitimate public relations... polls...and surveys. So it's a very useful practice. Now this helps any legislator to determine how the people are thinking... What they want. Thank you Senator... You see clarke and I always checked and double checked our figures... ...to make sure we were serving both YOUR office and the public. Yes...but what if you start tampering with the facts. Twisting the truth to further a particular cause, or client. You wind up serving your client... ...but swindling the public. You're saying... I'm saying that taking public opinion is useful... Making public opinion is dangerous. Alan...have you any idea how many highly financed full-time organisations... ...we now have set up here in Washington?... ...to pressure Congress and government agencies... ...for their particular groups and clients. The right of the people to petition the government. No question about it. And that right must be maintained. But it's a far cry from one citizen's 3-cent-stamped appeal... ...to the professionally packaged campaign. Complete, from fake front-groups with high-sounding titles... ...to pre-written laws... ready for our signature and endorsement. If money still talks, Senator... ...the little 3-cent stamp must have a hard time being heard. Exactly! My committee is out to determine, to what extent these hired loudspeakers may be drowning out or distorting the voice of the people. Legitimate lobbying is one thing... But we are preparing to investigate abuses that come to our attention. We are going to look into these influence peddlers in general... ..and in particular, Jim McGinnis's connection with certain groups in this country... ...that are out to sell us peace... at any price. From the things I've seen, Senator... ...it's hard to believe there could be too-high a price. There are 2 things worth buying... I've found... And you of all people know that slavery isn't one of them. Phoney front groups... ...offering a facade of respectability for the well-intentioned... ...but are really out to further their own hidden loyalties... To deliberately lead us down the road to another Munich. You mean Jim McGinnis... ...is using Eaton-Baker Associates to peddle propaganda?! Treason?! A puppet may look harmless. But how large will it grow? And who's pulling the strings? It's a pretty fine line between being a paid consultant... ...or a paid foreign agent. We think Jim McGinnis may have crossed that line. How far...we don't yet know. But HE knows he's on our list. He wants you, alright... ...for window-dressing! And you suggest I turn him down? Not at all. Join him!... And you'll give us what up to now we've never had... A man on the inside! A man we can trust. Senator Walder! Well sir, how about something on your committee, senator... Got a story for me? Coffee please... right over here. Not yet, Rodney! This young eager-beaver is Rodney Hillyer... He's a reporter. This is Captain Alan Eaton.. a good friend of mine... ...just back in Washington... Excuse me, Senator... you're wanted on the floor... ...a roll-call. Thank you. Duty calls... You two ought to get together... Alan here's had enough experience the last couple of years... ...for a feature-story. I'm catching "The Congressional" to New York, tonight... ...on committee business... May get back tomorrow. Think it over, Alan... let me have your answer. Thank you sir... Nice trip! Eaton, eh? Are you Alan Eaton of Eaton-Baker Associates? Yes, I was... I'm no longer a member of the organisation. Yeah, I know... Maybe, I got a story for YOU. What's that? Would it interest you to know... I interviewed Clarke Baker... ...the day before he was killed. Sit down. It was a funny thing about that interview... Clarke Baker didn't sound to me... like a guy who was planning to chuck things. Sell out...least of all to Jim McGinnis. Did he say that? Not on so many words, but... Well, there's another funny thing... Maybe you could call it a coincidence... Which is what? Well the first report that came through stated you were "missing in action". Presumed dead. And word of capture didn't come through till some time after that... After Clarke Baker had been found killed. Until then it appeared you were BOTH dead. Exactly what are you driving at? Well, it looks a lot to me... Like somebody thought that maybe with you dead... ...getting rid of Clarke Baker would leave a free field. But you came back. It's just possible you've upset some well-laid plans. You mean, you think McGinnis... I can't say McGinnis had anything to do with it personally... As a matter of fact, I covered the accident and the investigation... Why do you wait to tell ME about this? Have you taken your suspicions to the police? That's all I COULD take. Suspicions. Now, there was no witness to my interview with Clarke Baker... What's illegal about a guy selling out his business one day... ...and getting himself killed the next? If it wasn't a coincidence... ...what do YOU call it? Murder. Not so pure, or simple... But I got a hunch it was murder, all the same. I'm glad to have met you, Hillyer... Yes, what is it? Mr Eaton to see you, sir. Send him in! Well, Alan, what do you say? What's your answer? Where do I sign? Miss Dennis...send in those contracts for Mr Eaton... ...and ask Barney to step in, right away, will you? Alan, Boy...you're making no mistake... We're goin' places...and I'm gonna fit you right in the picture. Barney...I've got great news. Alan's back with us... Yes sir...he's on the team! Mr Eaton...I'm delighted, really delighted... I don't mind saying, I look forward to working under you. Let me have those contracts. That's all...thanks. Now all you gotta do is sign. It's a lot of money, McGinnis. Well...with options! Any little job you want to do... A short story, now and then, or... You could even write your war memoirs... We wouldn't object to that, would we, Barney? No, sir...we certainly wouldn't. There you are. Fine! Now, I want you to get the picture... I want to fill you in on all the potentials of this situation. Yeah? Mr Fletcher calling, sir. Excuse me. Hello, Fred.. Yeah, How's it going? I know we'll all profit by your experience, Mr Eaton. I for one learned a great deal... ...by studying your very interesting analysis of consumer prejudices. Well, thank you very much, Barney... ...I'm afraid that analysis is a little dated by now. Oh, not at all, sir... You catalogued fundamental human traits, and... ...they're constant factors. No, I should be able to get over there in about 10 minutes. Alan...that was Fletcher... up on the Hill... I got to get over there right away. Barney...why don't you give Alan that office next to yours. Have Miss Dennis get him whatever he needs... ...and fill him in on all the current projects. Now, look, boy... Don't push too hard your first day. If I get stuck... I'll see you tomorrow. - Right? - Sure...thanks. And Alan...you might call Senator Walder... He always thought a lot of you... ...and you COULD get him back. Let's get you set first, Mr Eaton...OK? I think you've already met Miss Dennis... Haven't you? She's a highly efficient young lady. Here's your office... right this way, sir. I hope everything's in order, here. We have a number of projects, right now. Fletcher is still lobbying Congress for legislation, on the Hill, isn't he? Why yes, he is. Which project of ours is he connected with? Must be awfully important, the way McGinnis was scooting out of here. Well, as a matter of fact, it is... Some of our biggest projects right now are for clients of his. We're conducting a campaign right now, in the Middle West... What sort of a campaign? Well, we're evaluating the reactions of voters in the election there. Since when did we get into politics? That's a little out of our line, isn't it? No...not really... The methods are just about the same... We use the same master card-index file... ...to select groups suitable for our field-interviewers to poll... We utilise the same media... ...direct-mail, radio, billboards and of course, television... It's still our job to sell our people the package. Selling a package of cigarettes, or... ..soap or cereal...that's one thing. But "selling" a mayor...or a governor... ..or a "package" of candidates for public office... That's quite a different thing. Is that all we're doing for Fred Fletcher?... Conducting a poll... and analysing the results. No...our service goes a little beyond that. I guess it might be best if I let Mr McGinnis fill you in on the details. Meanwhile, I'll have Miss Dennis... ...bring in some of the files on our other projects. You won't forget to call to the senator, will you... I know it would please Mr McGinnis. No...I'll call him. Thank you. Get me the Senate Office Building, would you, please. I'd like to talk to Senator Walder. That's right. Hello...Oh, I see... When he returns, tell him Alan Eaton called... Would you please.? He can find me here at Eaton-Baker Associates. That's right. Thank you. Just a minute, Miss Dennis... You were saying... I was saying what, Mr Eaton? When I left before... You were saying how "terribly sorry" you were. Exactly what are you so sorry about? Well...just about your coming back... ...and Mr Baker's accident. What about... "Mr Baker's accident"? Really, Mr Eaton... I don't know what you mean. I was only expressing my sympathy. Just sympathy? Nothing else? No, sir...nothing else. Very well... Thank you very much. Miss Dennis...have you had any luck getting me a hotel reservation? I see...well, thanks anyway. I'll find something. Will there be anything else, Mr Eaton... I wanted to close up now. No...I guess not, Miss Dennis... I think I've had enough for one day, myself. Very well, then I'll say goodnight. Oh, just a minute... How long have you been employed in this office, Miss Dennis? About a year and a half. Then you knew Mr Baker, didn't you? Well, only in the office. Do you like your job here, Miss Dennis? Yes, sir...I do. Exactly what IS your job? I mean, what do you... Can I get you a doctor? No...it's nothing...I... I just seem to have a horrible headache. Can I get you something?... What can I do? No...I'll be alright. You're very KIND. I'm terribly sorry. You seem to be always terribly sorry! I feel rather foolish. No...not at all... No reason for any apology. I have my car... can I drop you somewhere? I left my bag this morning at the Dupont Hotel... It's not out of my way. What are you going to do? You have to find a place to stay. There's always an all-night movie. That's not very practical. I'm not always the practical man. Meaning... Meaning...I sometimes take chances. I'm going to take a chance on you. I asked you if you liked your job. Do you like your boss? Mr McGinnis? I suppose so...I mean... Exactly what do you mean, Mr Eaton? I mean just this... I think you don't. There's something you're terribly sorry about. You started to tell me, once... ...and you changed your mind. I hope you find a place to stay. Goodnight, Mr Eaton. Thanks for the lift. I hope I haven't troubled you, Miss Dennis. Not at all. Yes? Good evening... My name is Eaton...Alan Eaton... Dr Gregory Jessup said you might be able to put me up for the night. What'd you say? Dr Jessup...I came in on the plane with him this morning. Well, come on in... come on in... Any friend of Dr Jessup is welcome here. Thank you. I'm Hal Loder and this here's Viv... I didn't get your name. Alan Eaton...Dr Jessup said... Sure...let me take this. Korea, eh?... Are you in the Service? I'm getting out. I was in the army. I was with the 1st Armoured Division. Hit the beach, right smack on D-Day. I got the Purple Heart. I went in there and my wife got a bunch of these... Maybe Mr Eaton would prefer a cup of coffee, Hal. Yeah...how about it? Cup of coffee.? Thanks very much... I don't want to put you.... No bother at all. We've always got some coffee cookin'... Haven't we, Viv? Sure thing, Hal. Only take a minute. Got a nice little room for you, upstairs. Plenty of privacy... all the comforts of home. I'll take the bag... No...you're the guest...ask Jessup... He'll tell you.. first-class treatment. Nothin' fancy... But you'll sleep like a kitten. I guarantee that. The washroom's through there... Maybe you'd like to wash up a bit. Well, thanks. Look...if you don't mind... I think I'll skip the coffee... I'm beat. Sure...that's alright... I could send Viv up with a cup. - No thanks. - Okay. That Viv ain't so bad in the kitchen. Help! Help! Stop it! You fool! You stupid fool! Not so stupid i couldn't see you givin' him "the big eye". What are you tryin' to do... Break my arm? A few cans of beer... and your just... Everything alright down there? You big ape! It's nothing, Mr Eaton. I just dropped a tray. How about a can of beer, Eaton? Well, how about it? No...thanks very much. Goodnight. You drunken ox! Do you want him to come down here, and see all this? You always HAD a big mouth! You lay another finger on me, Hal... - ...and I'll... - You'll what?! So help me... You really WILL get a Purple Heart! Mr Eaton... Breakfast is ready. Good morning. Where's...? He's sleeping it off. He gets a few cans of beer... watches a western on TV... ...and thinks he's Bronco Billy. Sit down. I'll have your eggs in a jiffy. Thanks very much... ...I generally just have a cigarette and coffee in the mornings. This'll do fine. It'll only take a second. Well, thanks very much... I wonder... Could I use your telephone? Sure...it's in the hall. You have your toast and coffee, while its hot. I've got to go tidy up. Thank you. Looking for something, Mrs Loder? I suppose you'll think I'm foolish, but... I've always had a yen for an attractive man in a uniform. You wouldn't understand that. Or could you? I might. But so might Mr Loder. Oh...that big ape! The nearest he ever got to a uniform was... Was where, you 2-bit tramp!? Go on, big mouth... tell 'im what you are... - Tell him what you... - Shut up! You got it all wrong! Drop it, Loder! As she said... You got the wrong idea. Go on, you big ape... Tell him about your war record... Tell him where you WERE, on D-Day! Go on...tell him! You're a no-good tramp... You're no good! I never like to outstay my welcome... so... Get up you ape... Get up and show us how you wiped out that bunch of Krauts. Come on...get up! Get up and get yourself killed! Get up, you big ape! I could take that bum... I could take him any time. Sure you can...sure you can... You're an old fight pro! Yes, I'll tell Mr McGinnis when he arrives. Yes...I've got that, thank you. Yes? Miss Dennis told me you just got in... Is there anything you'd like to get together on? Yes, Barney...come on in. Lorraine...Miss Dennis...said you had a little trouble getting a reservation... Did you finally find a place to stay? Yes...I did. You have everything you want? Rather, there's something I'd like, Barney... I've been studying this Fred Fletcher survey... Seems to me, we're a little lop-sided here. Lop-sided, Mr Eaton... How do you mean? Well, these questions are loaded questions, Barney... Take this one for instance... "Do you think Governor Jones is the best governor in office today"? Now you know as well as I... ...how few people could possibly know every governor of every state... ...or what kind of a job he's doing. Most of the answers would be no. And the poll shows that the people do not think... ...Governor Jones is the best man for the office. Are we running an HONEST survey? Or aren't we? Of course we are, Mr Eaton... The poll is only the first phase in the overall plan... I'm sure Mr McGinnis will explain. Yes, I'm sure he will. You know some of the stuff in this survey is pretty sharp... Much sharper than I give McGinnis credit for being. I sort of got the impression... ...that maybe you had something to do with it, Barney. Well, frankly, Mr Eaton... ...I did. Now, look, Barney...if you and I are going to work together... I need the advantage of YOUR thinking. Of course, if you don't feel you can speak for yourself... No...it isn't that, Mr Eaton... It's just... Well, I thought... What IS it? Well...you know Mr McGinnis... He has rather a strong way about him...and... Yes... So I've observed. Well, it's unfortunate that you don't have the authority... ...that a man of your obvious capabilities should have. Well...it's very nice of you to say, Mr Eaton... Thank you very much. Not at all. I know a thorough job, when I see one. But it seems to me, Barney... if WE're selling soap chips... We can defend claiming that we have some magic ingredient that no other brand has... ...or we can claim 4 out of 5 people smoke our brand of cigarettes.. ...but never admit that we only polled 5 people... ...and polled those people in our own office... ...or that we had to poll 500 people to find even 4... ...that smoked the brand of cigarettes at all. Now we can fool the people... ...by claiming our product is 90% more effective... ...90% stronger... ...but never say...more effective than "what"... ...or stronger than "what"... Could be nothing. It's OUR job to sell our product, Mr Eaton... We use the same techniques, 24 hours a day. The same techniques, the same media... 24 hours a day... Billboards...radio...television... But it's not only WHAT we're selling, that bothers me, Barney... But...WHO? What's BEHIND the billboard? What's INSIDE the package? What's our batting-average for honesty?... ...if we start PACKAGING politicians? After all, almost any issue calls for SOME speculation. Speculation on fact, is ONE thing... But if you're asked for an opinion... ...based on assumptions which are not fact... ...that's quite a different thing. I'm sure my figures are correct. Barney...look... We're professionals at this game... We know that figures can be made to prove almost anything. You ask only farmers if factory workers are overpaid. And you ask the factory workers... ...if the farmers are getting too much money for their product. We'll never get honest answers, even with honest questions... ...if we poll a prejudiced group of people. if I've got to make an analysis of this survey... ...I'll need a population breakdown... ...I'll need the master card-index file... ....to find out if we're polling a true cross-section of all the people. Well, I'll let you have my worksheets... Just the basic data, Barney... that's all I need. Who we're polling...and where. And for that, I'll need the master card file. Well, Mr McGinnis keeps that in his office... You'll have to ask HIM for that. Well...how's it goin'... What are you workin' on? Mr Eaton was just going over the Fletcher survey... He wants to check the poll... ...against the master card-index file. Now, we don't want to take advantage of him... do we Barney? Suppose you leave all that detail work to Barney here. Well, if I'm going to earn my money, around here... Let ME worry about that. Our deal calls for you to act as a consultant. You know... Advice on high-level strategy. I'd feel much better qualified to do that... ...if I could have a look at the card-index file... ...because I've been away for quite a while, you know... There have been some significant changes in population and incomes since then. Forget it... Leave that to the drones. Look, I hate to pull him away... But I'd like to go over some things with Barney, here. Sure...go ahead. Miss Dennis...would you come in here for a moment please. Yes, Mr Eaton? Sit down...Miss Dennis...please. Are you familiar with the Fletcher survey, Miss Dennis? Well, just generally... I've taken some dictation on it. Well, I'm making an analysis of the survey...for Mr McGinnis... In order to make sure we're polling a true cross-section... of the population in that area... ...I would like to check the list ...of the people to be polled by our field interviewers... ...against the master card-files... ...Would you get those for me, please? Well, the master card-files are classified "Confidential'... They're kept locked in Mr McGinnis's office. Mr Barnes made up the list of people to be polled... He could tell you. Well, you see, I don't want Mr Barnes to misunderstand... You could ask Mr McGinnis... He has the only key. Yes...I could. But I'd rather not. Well, Mr McGinnis would understand. Yes, I'm afraid he would. That's why I don't want to ask him. Miss Dennis... I would like to see those card files... without asking Mr McGinnis... ...or telling Mr Barnes, just now. Mr Eaton, you're asking me... I'm asking you to help me. Last night I told you I was going to take a chance on you... I'm doing just that. How should I know?! He may know more than we think he does. In any case, we gotta be sure. I tell you one thing I'm sure of... I don't like it. I don't like it, one bit! And you stop him from poking his nose into things around here... That's your job! Of course, Mr McGinnis. I feel sure that Mr Eaton is only naturally curious about our projects. Okay...You satisfy his curiosity... But steer him clear of the Fletcher project. Of course, Mr McGinnis... I'll do my best. Your "best" better be good enough. So...if I'm going to find out what's going on around here... ...and exactly what this Fletcher campaign means... ..and who's behind HIM. I'm going to need some help. Mr Eaton...is that ALL you want to find out? Is there anything else? I'm not sure... But I'm not sure you're not just testing me... Testing my "loyalty" to the team. Mr McGinnis did say you were on HIS team. So that's why you wouldn't talk. You think that I'm with... Sit down, Miss Dennis. Do you know why I've come back? I'll tell you why I'm back... ...what I'm looking for. This time it's something that I'M terribly sorry about. I'm sorry to see people's thinking, polluted... ...by bought and paid-for lies. I'm also sorry to see a decent, useful business... ...that Clarke Baker and I built from the ground up... ...taken over to serve the interests of well-heeled lobbyists... ..like this Fred Fletcher. But most of all I'm sorry about Clarke Baker. You see, Miss Dennis... ...if they can twist the opinions of 100,000 people... ...it's a lead-pipe cinch they can twist the facts about a simple hit-and-run accident. You think Mr Baker was... I don't know what I think right now, Miss Dennis. But I'm sure of one thing... I'm going to find out. Now, are YOU on MY team? How do you know I'm not on THEIRS? That's a chance I've got to take. I'll get the keys. Let me help you, Miss Dennis. Thank you, Mr Barnes. - Miss Dennis... - Yes? Miss Dennis... Sometimes it seems as if you hardly know my name... ...or that I'm even here at all. You must be joking, Mr Barnes. I assure you, Miss Dennis... I've never been more serious about anything in my life. You can't possibly be serious, Mr Barnes. "Mr Barnes"... That's exactly what I mean! I've got a first name... it's "Barney". Really...this is hardly the time... Or the place, is it Lorraine... Look... When is it time... What does it take? 6-feet tall...good looks... Is that what...? Really...I don't know what you mean... Mr McGinnis is waiting for me. Mr McGinnis is waiting... Let him wait! Listen, it's taken me a long time... ...to get the courage to say this to you Lorraine, but... Hey...what's goin' on out here?! Miss Dennis... She dropped some letters... Sure... Well, bring 'em in here! Put them down over there. Sit down. I want you to take a letter. Fred Fletcher. Dear Fred... Hey...can you hear me over this thing? Oh, yes... Perfectly, Mr McGinnis. I've had sample conversations prepared... ...included your slanted questioning of our opponents church affiliation... ...and relationship with his secretary. I'll send these to our men in the field, the day before the polls. Did you get that? Oh, yes, Mr McGinnis. Always forget those whiskers under my chin. We'll also supply speakers for the business groups and garden clubs in that area... ...with the extra budget you O.K.'d. The budget allows... Hey, what's the matter with you? Oh...nothing...nothing, Mr McGinnis. It'd getting late... we'll finish it in the morning. Thank you. Right, Hillyer...anything that can help. Hold on a minute... He doesn't know I've got it. How much time have we got? I don't know... He's getting ready to leave now. I can get back in there... No, you've taken enough of a chance already. It shouldn't take me very long. Where can I meet you...later? Well, there's a restaurant around the corner, on K Street...Otto's... How about there? Just a minute. Oh, Hillyer...I'll be at a restaurant called Otto's... Do you know where it is? Right... Well...I'll see you there. Goodbye. That was Rodney Hillyer, of the "Post". Give me about... Well...I thought you were going home. Well...I was just leaving. Goodnight, Miss Dennis. Goodnight, Mr McGinnis. Well, Alan...you look bushed. How about calling it a day? You know, I think I will. Need a place to stay? Can I drop you any place? No, thanks very much, McGinnis... I think the walk would do me good. The Dupont Hotel confirmed my reservations today... I'll be living there. Fine... By the way Alan... Did you happen to get through to Senator Walder, today? Yes...I did. How did he sound? Do you think you can bring him back into the fold? There's a distinct possibility... However the senator DID have some questions. Don't we all?! We both know the senator's business doesn't mean any real coin... It's a "prestige account". Wouldn't have anything to do with his committee would it? Sure it would! And I'm the first one to admit it. Public relations are not for "charity"... ...but it does "begin at home." Let's face it, Alan... Business is business. You don't see any of those senators working for nothin', either. And I tell you... You bring Senator Walder back on the team... ...and I'll play ball with him. I'll spend more money on his account, than it brings in. I'll use the same interviewers... ...the same field personnel... ...we have on the various accounts throughout his state. He won't have to worry about beggin' for handouts and contributions on election day, either. And he won't have to depend on a bunch of squirrely housewives... ...and high school volunteers... ...to pass out mimeographed handbills on the street corners. I'll punch every doorbell in his state. And I'll furnish him with more volunteers... I'll bet you will, too. Well, listen to ME!... Look who's tellin' YOU! Let's leave the old boiler factory... tomorrow's another day. Get yourself a good dinner. Take in a show, and relax. You know..."All work and no play..." Sure I can't drop you anywhere? No thanks, I'd rather walk. Goodnight, Alan. Sorry to be so long...but... McGinnis is quite concerned about Senator Walden. - What about the key? - I've got it. But McGinnis locked the office... Can you get in? I have an office key. Would you like to order now? Thanks, we're waiting for another party. Would you care for a drink? Yes, I'd like an 'Old-Fashioned'. Bring the lady a small glass of sherry. Be good for your nerves. Alan...are you alright? It's nothing... It'll go away. Maybe I should drink the sherry myself. Mr Eaton..are you sure... I like it better the other way. "The other way?" You just called me "Alan". Alan...shouldn't you see a doctor? - I mean, these... - These symptoms? They're war souvenirs... They told me they'd go away. ...if I take it easy and avoid excessive strain. Isn't there anything you can do? What about the army doctor? What I'd really planned to do... ...was to let Clarke run the business here... ...and I was going to head for California... ...and let the sun and the beach cure what ails me. That's what I'd planned to do. But Clarke Baker's dead. So California and the army doctors are going to have to wait... ...until I find out WHY Clarke baker's dead. Couldn't we go to the police. With what? Suspicions? We're going to need proof. Black and white proof... ..of exactly what he's doing... ...and for whom. And what really happened to Clarke Baker on the Fesder Rd that night. But where do we start?! Those master card-files... You see, McGinnis can't sell any client, or the public... ...with a guesswork polling of a handful of people. But Alan..you can't question a 100 million people. No...that's true... No one actually ever does. Who CAN you believe? Well, we use the US Department of Commerce... ...The Labor Department... ...the Government Census Bureau... Every available source of authentic information... ...I used to set up that master card-file. If McGinnis has changed those cads... ...I want to find out how many people he's really polling... ...and how he picked them. And if they can speak for 160 million people. And if we can get the master card-files... ...and find that Mr McGinnis HAS changed them... ...or isn't using them at all... ...we've got the beginning of our proof. But only the beginning... Most people... from Maun St to Madison Ave... ...prefer to go along with the majority. Sponsors of television programs... ...will buy or drop a program... ...not because they went out and rang 50 million doorbells... ...but because some paid poll claims... ...that 50 million people DID of did NOT see that particular program. But doesn't that give a few people a frightening amount of power? I mean, if you can make or break a television program... McGinnis may be juggling statistics... ...in order to make or break hand-picked candidates for public office. Hello, Eaton... I'm sorry to keep you. I'd like you to meet Miss Lorraine Dennis. She works for McGinnis. Oh...how do you do? That's alright...she's helping me. Sit down. Well, there's nothing on McGinnis... No record of any kind, that I could find. Well, what about Clarke Baker's accident? - Any witnesses turn up? - No. Just the 2 who testified for McGinnis at the inquest. They check out alright? They checked out alright... McGinnis spent the rest of the night with THEM. The WHOLE night with them. They played cards till 4 in the morning. One of them took him home and spent the rest of the night at his place... ...McGinnis's place. They had breakfast together. Look...their testimony placed McGinnis right here in town, all that night. He hadn't been anywhere near the accident. There's not much to go on there, is there? Well, I've got to get back to the city desk... I'm on tonight. If I run into anything else... I'll give you a ring. - Thanks...thanks very much. - It's been a pleasure. Good luck. There MUST be something. Alan, didn't Mr Baker write you anything about McGinnis, before it happened? Not that I remember. Of course, we weren't much for writing... either one of us. And letters from home, and writing paper, were luxuries... ...that our Chinese hosts thought we should be without. Alan...isn't it possible that it WAS an accident? I mean, Mr McGinnis might... Anything is possible, Lorraine. It's even possible that I'm just looking for skeletons in closets... ...and under the beds... that don't even exist. It's even possible that Mr McGinnis and the doctors are correct. I'm sorry! You know, Lorraine... ...you're not only very kind... ...you're very lovely. I thought you'd never notice. Alan..aren't you taking a terrible chance? I've GOT to. I suppose if those 2 men were with McGinnis...all night... Well, BOTH of them weren't. Mr Hillyer said he only took ONE of them home with him. Then only ONE could swear that McGinnis was in town all night. Does it give his name? According to the testimony... Dr Gregory Jessup at the inquest. Gregory Jessup! That's a man I met on the plane... What's the name of the other witness? A man named Loder...Harold Loder. Loder...wait a minute... Jessup...to Loder...to McGinnis. May I have that office key? - Let me go with you. - No, you'd better stay here. The pieces of this puzzle are beginning to fall into place. I won't be long. Like a drink? I don't mind if I do. You know, between MY printing press and these signatures... This is the best yet, if I say so myself. Yeah? let's see. Dear Senator... As Chairman and charter member of "Sons of the Patriotic Pioneers"... I wish to inform you that our organisation is 100% opposed to... Not bad, eh?! Did you get that "Sons of the Patriotic Pioneers"?! I thought that up by myself. Ain't that a pip?! Now, this is YOUR baby... "Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Warfare" DR Gregory Jessup...Executive Chairman. Even the signature's impressive. Yeah...Viv sure knows her business. Why, she could sign "John Hancock"... and fool the old boy himself. Yeah?...Before you go pinnin' any medals on yourself... Remember you didn't do so well with Alan Eaton. Now look...don't blame me... Viv had her chance... Can I help it if she muffed it? If he'd never got a letter from Baker.. he had it somewhere. You should have found it, if he'd stayed. Why'd he leave? How should I know? He just upped and left. Ask Viv...she'll tell you. This guy must be crazy. If you ask me, I know how to handle this... I'm not askin' you. I'm tellin' you... If he's got that letter... you better find it. Oh, it's YOU?! Hello Harold. I thought, maybe... Who were you expectin'? Clarke Baker?! I tried to phone you... I've got to talk to you. Well, alright...tell me... Spit it out! Mr Eaton...he was with Lorraine... Miss Dennis...at Otto's... So what? So the handsome captain's makin' a pass... What's that to us? A fella met him there... The nosey reporter at the inquest... ...that kept coming around here asking questions...when Mr Baker... She gave him a key... I thought maybe... She gave him a key? So, she gave him a key, eh? I wonder what for? Let's leave Lorraine out of this, McGinnis. Oh...you're in there. You heard? Yes, I heard... I heard you both loud and clear. So what? So Loder's got a pen-pal club. "Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Warfare" Dr Gregory Jessup...Executive Chairman. Also, fellow-traveller. "Sons of the Patriotic Pioneers" You know...Loder's right... His wife's forgeries could fool even John Hancock himself. I should know. When did you get her to forge Clarke Baker's signature to that contract? Before or after you killed him? Go ahead, McGinnis...pick up the phone... You threatened to before... This time I'm calling your bluff! Call the police. Police? Mr McGinnis... What does he mean? There's nobody out there. Mr Eaton claims he overheard out conversation. And he's making a lot of accusations about YOUR wife... ...and Clarke Baker's accident. Let me handle this. Stay out of this! I'll handle it. Now, look... You're not in a position to accuse anyone... If you tell the police anything... ...you know what I'll tell 'em... I'll tell 'em you're off your rocker! What chance do you think a brain-washed psycho like you would have of convincing anybody of anything. Alright... Let's put our cards on the table. Sure, I'm not runnin' any penny-ante organisation like you and Baker did... Far from it! I got clients. Important clients. And they won't hold still for some mental-case makin' a lot of careless accusations. You don't hear the clients holler, do you? And they're the ones that are payin' the bills. What do YOU want? A cut of the take? Look... I'm reasonable. I gave Clarke Baker his chance... ...and I'm giving you yours, right now! Or what?...McGinnis. Do I go the same way that Clarke Baker did? A faked hit-and-run accident? Okay, wise-guy... He tried his way... Now I'll try mine. Did you want to order dinner now? No, I was waiting... What time is it? It's a quarter of ten. I'd better see what's keeping him. Give him some of this. - Why, you dirty... - Here...that's enough! Harold here believes in rather primitive methods of persuasion... But you leave us no alternative... You don't co-operate... Now, give us that letter! Your boy's an amateur. I've been worked over by professionals. They call it "co-existence". He needs some more persuasion, Harold... Give it to 'im! No...no! What do you suggest we do? Let him walk out of here... and straight to the police? You said yourself, he had no proof. Sure, I said...! Did you hear what HE said? He's wise to the whole set-up. Maybe if we talked to Mr Fletcher... Dropped the whole campaign... Sure! Drop the whole campaign... ...lose the election... ...then "EXPLAIN" to Fred Fletcher! What about Jessup, and HIS people? They're in it for high stakes and for keeps. Maybe YOU feel like throwing a couple of million bucks out of the window... ...and taking a 4000-mile one-way trip... But I don't! What about HIM? It wouldn't work... Another auto accident... They'd know right away! Another hit-and-run, maybe... What about a suicide? Suicide? That's it! Everybody knows that Eaton's "punchy", anyway. Yeah...he comes back, he's all mixed up... Baker's gone...he gets despondent... and... And what? It's simple. He takes a nice long walk down to the river. ...gets to Memorial Bridge...and... Jumps. Yeah...we could have Viv write us a suicide note. We can't... What do you mean..."we can't"?! We've got to. How were we supposed to know Eaton was gonna come back here from the dead? Do you think we can let him walk out of here with that letter... ...with what he knows now... to the police? What those Chinese Commies didn't finish... we've GOT to. Try and make a hit. I tell you, we can't! Lorraine was there... she knows he's here... - She's waiting for him now. - Hold it! He's right! If she's in it with him... we've got to go pick her up, too. Barney... If he comes to...don't let him get out of that chair. Understand?... Come on, Harold. And Barney... Just remember that you're in this as deep as WE are... ...all the way down the line. It won't work, Barney... You KNOW it won't work. I'm sorry, Mr Eaton... I really am. Sorry for what, Barney? Sorry about THIS? Or are you sorry about Fred Fletcher? And all those lies. Or Dr Jessup...and treason! And maybe you're sorry about Clarke Baker. it's no use, Mr Eaton... I have no choice. What's YOUR hurry, little lady? You're wrong, Barney... it's NOT too late... not yet. You don't understand, Mr Eaton... You don't know what it's like, for somebody like ME. Sure, it's fine for you... you're a big war-hero! You can get anything or anybody you want. You've even got Lorraine. - Lorraine? - Yes! Lorraine! Every day watching her walk in and out of the office... You've seen the way she was... Do you think I'm blind? With Clarke Baker gone, I might've had a chance... But then YOU had to come back. What chance have I got now?! Barney, you've got to listen to me. What chance has Lorraine got, with McGinnis? Why do you think they went to get her? What do you think Loder will do to HER? I won't get Lorraine, Barney... but neither will you. McGinnis won't LET you get her. - Give me the gun. - You're lying. You're lying. They just want to make sure she won't talk, that's all. Like he made sure with Clarke Baker?! The way he's going to make sure with ME? He wouldn't do a thing like that to Lorraine... You can't stop him! Yes I can...I can stop him... He's got to listen to me. I know all about Dr Jessup and Mr Fletcher... I know how they killed Clarke Baker... I know too much! That's why you've got to give me the gun, Barney... Because you DO know too much. They won't stop with US... YOU'll be next! Let her go, Loder.. Get the files...they're in there. Look, Eaton...I didn't want it to work out this way... I gave Clarke Baker every chance in the world to see it our way... ...and he wouldn't. Don't call the cops... What'll it get you? Another medal or somethin'? Look, there's millions in this... I give you my word! Your word! I'm not going to call the police... There are millions, alright, McGinnis... Millions of people being lied to... ...taken for suckers! You know, it's a funny thing... They have pure food and drug laws... ...to keep people from buying poison to put in their stomachs... And you're peddling poison to put in their minds! Call Senator Walder, Lorraine... He's at the Wardman Park Hotel. Look...I'll tell you what... You come with us, and I'll split everything right down the middle. And I'm not talkin' about any lousy 20 or 30 thousand a year salary, either. Your kind of public relations are peanuts! And with that, we turn the screws on the United States Congress... ...and from there it's just a step to the White House. With OUR people, we can't miss! Can't you see that? Yes, I can see alright. I can see what you and your phoney front groups are manufacturing. You're manufacturing fear... ...in order to sell your "peace-at-any-price" campaign. It's not going to be very difficult for the senator... ...to find out just who is paying the bills. I'm beginning to see just how big a puppet is growing... ...and who is pulling the strings. Alan, Senator Walden's out... they're expecting him back. Leave word, will you. Tell him to call me right away. No deal, McGinnis. Keep away from me or I'll rip his arm off! Well, Captain Eaton... You pilfered my files... That's stealing... I'm surprised at YOU. I ought to turn you over to the authorities. You leave me no choice. I've got to get rid of you permanently. What about her? She goes, too. No...you're not gonna hurt Lorraine. - Why...you little punk... - Stay back...I'm warning you... I'm warning you, Hal... I'll shoot! I'll shoot! You stupid fool! He asked for it! Come on...let's get out of here... We gotta work fast. Let's go, Eaton. Hello... Are you there Alan? Hello...this is Senator Walder... What's wrong, Alan? Can you hear me? Yes...I hear you. Go on. They shot me...McGinnis has taken them... black convertible...a Mark 5. Where's he taking them? The river...Memorial Bridge. Can't throw 'em both from the bridge. Of course not...2 suicides... nobody 'd buy that. Look...we'll go out Mt Vernon Hwy... I know a turn, we can drive this job right in the river. Another accident? - Do you think that they...? - We gotta take a chance! Look, he wanted to buy the car see.. They had a few drinks... Wanted to show her how fast it'd go... ...missed the turn. Think of something better? Yes sir, Senator...got it. Dispatcher...emergency procedure... This an APB... All cars Area Zone 4... Intercept and apprehend occupants of Mark 5 convertible... Intercept black Mark 5 convertible... Heading west...Memorial Bridge. First Clarke...and now Barney. You can't kill all of us. Listen to the loon... He's off his rocker. Whaddaya know!...the punchy captain passed out again. Take care of HER! This is for Clarke Baker, and a lot of guys in Korea! Here's my card... If there's anything further, you can contact my office. We've both had enough of speeches, Alan... ...so I won't start one now... But I want you to know how grateful I am... Not only for my committee, but for all of us. And you too, Miss Dennis. When you feel up to it Alan... come on over. - We'll be waiting. - Thank you, sir. My darling, I was so frightened. I thought you... I might have been... I'm awfully glad I took that chance on YOU. Are you sure you're alright, Captain Eaton? - Yes, I'm alright. - We'll need your statement. Any time tomorrow will do. Alright. I mean, now that it's over... will you go to California? It's never over, Lorraine. You know, HE was right... You can't fool all the people all the time. But nowadays, you don't HAVE to fool all the people... Just enough to swing it for the Fletchers and the Jessups. I'm going to keep that date... ...with the senator's committee. And after that... California can wait... ...for the both of us.
