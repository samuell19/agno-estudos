VICTORY IN WESTERN UKRAINE AND THE EXPULSION OF THE GERMAN AGGRESSORS BEYOND THE BORDERS OF SOVIET UKRAINE This is a chronicle of the glorious years of the Red Army, 1943-44, that showed the world through fierce battles the courage of soldiers, the military genius of commanders, and the inexhaustible will of the Soviet people in their quest to vanquish fascism for the sake of freedom for all humanity and the life and prosperity of our socialist Motherland and its noble ideals. Field producers of front line cinema crews: V. Shtatland, S. Gurov, M. Oshurkov A film by A. Dovzhenko, Yu. Solntseva Narration by A. Dovzhenko Narrated by L. Khmara Produced by F. Filippov Written by Yu. Solntseva, A. Kuznetsov This film makes use of German archival footage A co-production of the Central Documentary Studio and the Ukrainian Documentary Studio In this film, we will refrain from showing horror. We won't burden our souls looking at death. We will observe silence in remembrance of untold numbers of Nazi atrocities, the grief of mothers, the wounds of tortured Soviet children, millions of enslaved people, every fourth Ukrainian house that was burned, innumerable ruins of our cities. We will show humanity only a small fraction of filmed atrocities. Through the eyes of history, we will bear witness to the Nazi contempt for the labor, prosperity, dignity, and honor of our people. We did not film this footage. It was made by enemy cameramen, who preserved for posterity atrocities committed by their vile generation on our glorious, heroic, suffering Soviet Ukrainian land. Here they crawl to the other side of the Dnieper, Hitler's spiritually crippled Nibelungen. Their battalions, destroyed in cruel battles, drag their feet. They steal herds. They blow up factories, barracks, train stations, destroy suburbs of Kiev. Darnitsa is burning. The Nikolsky settlement is bombed to the ground. So is Troukhanov Island. Bridges over the Dnieper have been destroyed. Berlin is nervous. Nazi noise fills radio waves worldwide. Hitler, defeated from Stalingrad to Poltava, roars about the Dnieper line. The criminal is afraid. To lose the Dnieper means to lose Ukraine. The loss of Ukraine means the defeat of Germany. He orders that the right bank of the Dnieper be held at all costs. He sends troops from France to the Dnieper. He is not only saving himself. He is saving all of Europe. Beware! The Red Army is at the Dnieper! Indeed, a menace to all enemies of humanity, the Red Army approached the Dnieper. In the autumn of 1943, the Dnieper's shores came to life. Following orders of the Red Army Central Command, all four Ukrainian fronts, from Poles ye to Zaporozhye, dashed westward in one mighty sweep. The Soviet Armies made their way to the Dnieper, using combat skills honed at Stalingrad, Voronezh, Belgorod, Kharkov, on the Don, and in many other brilliant battles. With incredible swiftness and surprise, they crossed the river at Pereyaslav-Khmelnitskiy, at Vyzhgorod, north of Kiev, and southeast of Kremenchug. The great battle for the Dnieper began. This battle will go down in the history of warfare as an exceptional event, as a miracle. The brilliant and wise ideas of the Commander, the genius of the people, the unprecedented power of common will, and anger and courage of soldiers and officers manifested themselves in one mighty effort. A thousand-year long history of Slavs on the Dnieper has inspired heroism in their descendants. Having witnessed for the first time the Last Judgment, the saints of the ancient Kiev Monastery of Caves, destroyed by the Nazis, were watching the waves of the great Slavic river from their gilded wreck. Those were dark heroic nights, full of military miracles. Autumn nights of woeful soldier joy. Nights of courage and struggle more intense than any previously known to man. The hatred of the enemy was so great; vast masses of our soldiers so much wished to vanquish them; liberators of the Motherland desired victory so greatly; that death sometimes refused to accept the fallen. Then fighters were coming out alive from the very depths of Hell. Looking back at their deadly route, they surprised those around them with their unprecedented fearlessness and robustness of character. Fighting on the right bank of the Dnieper began with the expansion of our positions at Bukrin, facing the city of Pereyaslav-Khmelnitskiy. Here, Army General Vatutin for the first time sent large tank units under Generals Rybalko and Kravchenko to the other side of the Dnieper. Protected by artillery, they descended upon main enemy formations. The Germans urgently pulled large tank and infantry units from Kiev and Znamenka. Heavy fighting ensued with no side prevailing. At this time, army units of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, under Army General Konev's command, dealt the enemy a massive blow in the direction of Krivoy Rog and captured Pyatikhatka, a large railway station. Following this, army units of the 3rd Ukrainian Front under General Malinovsky's command, liberated large cities on the Dnieper, Dnieprodzerzhinsk and Dniepropetrovsk. This was the first important victory of our armies in the Battle on the Dnieper. Even though cities were burning, the enemy destroyed large factories, bridges collapsed, the Germans conducted massive counteroffensives at Znamenka and Krivoy Rog, which for a time equaled their successes, the area was finally taken by our forces. Like a giant wedge, our new positions split the German defenses on the right bank of the Dnieper in the most vulnerable place. In the middle of fighting for Krivoy Rog, Army General Talbukhin lead the 4th Ukrainian Front on the offensive. By November 3, he cut off German forces on the Crimean Peninsula. Meanwhile, commanders of the 1st Front realized that efforts to take the area around Bukrin had not been very successful. Therefore, they decided to secretly relocate the main task forces to Vyzhgorod, where our forces were assembling and building temporary bridges over the river. Having secretly covered more than 100 kilometers, tank forces of Generals Kravchenko and Rybalko suddenly appeared near Vyzhgorod. On November 3, Vatutin's armies launched an offensive moving around Kiev toward Fastov. Germans in defense lines later admitted that they had never faced such heavy artillery fire. Artillery barrage literally drove the enemy into the ground. The tank units of Generals Rybalko and Kravchenko moved through the gap in the enemy lines. At dawn on November 6, on the eve of the great holiday, ancient Kiev, the symbol of our unbreakable unity, appeared to our soldiers in its tragic glory. The last packs of enemy hyenas scurried away. The Nazi scourge disappeared. The first messengers of liberation moved into the city. Why was no one meeting the liberators? Where were the people? Where were the joyous crowds of happy Kievans? There was nobody. Acrid smoke was blowing over empty streets of the city. Bogdan's club was raised high on the historic monument. Hurry, my children! Our people are enslaved! Catch up with the enemy and destroy him! Avenge yourselves! Spill the evil blood of the enemy on our free soil! Suddenly, Kravchenko's tanks rolled onto Shevchenko Boulevard. Here were the Kievans. They emerged from the smoke, as if in a dream. There were so few of them. There was no sense of triumph. That day, no one could recognize the citizens of Kiev. They couldn't even recognize themselves. The war had changed them so much. Two years under Nazi rule had felt like two centuries spent away from humanity in a pillaged city. These years had left a deep mark in their souls. 200,000 citizens were shot, tortured to death, hanged, and poisoned in gas chambers. Many others were kidnapped or hid in forests, ravines, and cemeteries. In Babi Yar alone, perpetrators shot more than 100,000 unfortunate citizens. They buried toddlers alive along with their dead mothers. You could see how the earth was trembling, how it was shaking with movement of live people. Here people were rounded up with dogs. People were hiding like animals. Here they cried, yelled, cursed, and said farewell forever. Here small children saw monstrosities unimaginable even in Dante's Inferno. Let Kiev never forget these young lads, heroes of the Dnieper. Let poets sing their glory for centuries to come. How they were climbing up onto Vladimir Hill from all over the Soviet Union. How they spilt red blood on the white sand of native shores. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Marshal Zhukov, Commander of the 1st Ukrainian Front Army General Vatutin, and Head of the Ukrainian Government, Khrushchev attend a meeting of the liberated citizens of Kiev. "On behalf of soldiers, officers, generals, and Red Army units, I extend to you heartfelt congratulations on the historic defeat of German forces near Kiev and the liberation of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.” "The Germans never anticipated the kind of defeat they suffered in Kiev." "Let the enemy remember and never forget that our great Soviet people joined around their leader, Comrade Stalin, to continue the struggle like never before. We will keep fighting until we achieve a complete victory. Let our Soviet people prosper! Hail Commander-in-Chief, Comrade Stalin! Glory, glory to the great and wise Stalin!” "Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Stalin, decorated with the glorious name 'Kievsky' many divisions and regiments that took part in liberating the city. Glory and honor to all the Kievsky divisions and regiments that liberated the city. Allow me, comrades, to assure you as a Front Commander, that all Kievsky units will carry their name westward with dignity until the enemy is completely destroyed.” "The struggle against the German occupiers brought all of our people closer together around the Communist Party, around the communist banner under the wise leadership of our great leader Stalin. Glory to the Soviet people! Glory to our valiant Red Army! Glory to our Commander, our great and beloved Stalin!” Vanquished in Kiev, the Germans are fleeing. They are in fear of encirclement. Vatutin's units move toward Fastov. Once they capture Fastov, they move infantry and cavalry to Korosten and Zhitomir. By then, the Germans had moved from Germany, and from the south, eight tank divisions and began a counterattack on November 12. Nevertheless, units under Vatutin defeated the enemy and captured Zhitomir and Korosten. Storm clouds were gathering over all German units on the right bank. The German command tries at all cost to recapture Zhitomir and Korosten. They use large reserve forces to launch a counteroffensive. They recapture Zhitomir and Korosten at great cost and advance on Brusilov. But they can move no further. Tank units of Generals Rybalko and Bogdanov joined the fight. Germans crashed against Soviet tanks as if against a wall. Having exhausted the enemy, on December 24, Soviet forces began an offensive. The battle for the Dnieper was won. A huge gap was carved out in the German defenses on the right bank of the river. The Red Army smashed the German wall and was menacing German forces south of the front line. There were 19 German tank divisions out of 26 on the Eastern Front. This was the turning point. At the end of December all Ukrainian fronts swing into action. First, Vatutin's forces strike Kazatin and Vinnitsa, and Konev's forces strike Kirovograd. The fighting in Vinnitsa was especially heavy. The Germans used their reserves and mounted a staunch defense against units of the 1st Ukrainian Front. For more than two months Vinnitsa was shaking from non-stop artillery fire. During these battles, the left wing of the 1st Ukrainian Front, in collaboration with the right wing of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, encircled a large enemy force at Korsun-Shevchenkovsky. The Germans badly wanted to retain the Dnieper. Despite a hopeless situation, the German command was still hoping to win back the right bank of the river. After building a powerful defense line, ten divisions of the enemy prepare to defend this ground. And they dig in. On Hitler's orders, they indulge in gluttony. Meat, bacon, eggs, sandwiches, three shots of schnapps per corpse. 80,000 mouths chew to their hearts' content. In a week's time, when half of them are dead, Hitler orders soldiers to shoot their wounded comrades and to shoot themselves. Terrified, they will do just that. For 14 days the battle raged on the Dnieper. Expecting help, Hitler's army stubbornly fought on. Help was near. Leaving battles east of Vinnitsa, the Germans sent 500 tanks to storm Zvenigorodka and Lysyanka to save encircled units. However, army units of Generals Vatutin and Konev turned the tide by killing 27,000 Nazi soldiers and officers. Hitler threatened his generals in vain. In vain he ordered all trapped soldiers to kill themselves. In vain he offered three shots of alcohol to every soldier. Nothing could help. Like caged animals, they thrashed about blindly in the iron grip of the encirclement. The grip became ever tighter. A few days before the final showdown, a blizzard swept the battlefield. Ravines, fields, and roads were covered with snow. Guns were firing through the blizzard at the village of Shenderovka. On the morning of the 15th when the blizzard was over and the guns became silent, the heroes of the people emerged from a house, apparently after a nice chat. Here were Marshal Zhukov, Generals Vatutin, Konev, Moskalenko, Trofimenko, Rybalko, Rotmistrov, the whole staff of those responsible for the glorious victory on the Dnieper, the second Stalingrad, that covered our arms with glory. In front of them, in profound silence, under the white cover of the Eastern "Lebensraum,” lay 79,000 dead enemies. They raped our land with plunder, sickness, and fire. They sewed mines in our fields. These mines would continue to blow up our children for years to come. General Stemmermann was also lying in the snow. 18,000 devastated POWs mumbled the same tired words: Hitler kaput. The famous spring offensive of three Ukrainian fronts began in early March. The suddenness of the offensive upset all enemy plans. Main forces of the 1st Ukrainian Front moved from Kazatin to Shapitovka. From there, on March 4, the Red Army marched directly south, at the main German railway hub at Tornopol-Proskurov. On March 6, Marshal Konev followed with a major strike on Uman. Here the Germans planned to stop the Red Army's advance. Yet, Rotmistrov's tank units crashed into the German lines with such force that the enemy, taken by surprise, abandoned all its equipment and fled. 20,000 German corpses remained to rot on the Ukrainian steppes. All of the Nazi zoo, Panthers and Tigers, 500 tanks, 200 of them in working condition, all sorts of artillery and military equipment were left behind at Uman. Having smashed the enemy defenses, the 2nd Ukrainian Front moved toward the Romanian border at Prut. Expecting another encirclement, the enemy flees from Vinnitsa to Kamenets-Podolsk, Yarmolitsy. Then the main forces of the 1st Front break through at Tornopol and Volochiysk, and, moving south, capture Zaleshchiki, Chernovitsy, and Kamenets-Podolsk. Now the German units have no way of moving west. At the same time, units of the 2nd Front that were advancing along the Dniester to Khotin cut the enemy away from Romania and closed the circle. 14 enemy divisions perished in the encirclement, and only a small fraction of Germans managed to flee, abandoning all their equipment. The 2nd Ukrainian Front came to Prut at the Romanian border. On March 6, the 3rd Ukrainian Front under Army General Malinovsky's command attacked the enemy toward Novyy Bug and broke enemy lines. Pliyev's cavalry attacked, as well. After liberating Novyy Bug, cavalry and tank divisions moved to Nikolayev. Following that, news of another victory sweeps the country. Heeding advice from Marshal Vasilevsky, General Malinovsky's units encircled the main forces of the German 6th Army southeast of Novyy Bug and destroyed them. Only 14,000 enemy soldiers were spared and taken prisoner. Deprived of their treacherous weapons, they shed their proud Prussian gait on foreign soil. Their rhetoric also changed. So did their salute: Death to Hitler! On April 13, liberation came to Odessa. Unvanquished Soviet people came out of their dark Odessa catacombs. Glory, glory to the liberators! Glory to the heroic Red Army! Glory to the great Stalin! The joy of liberation spread all over Odessa. All of this happened in the spring of 1944. If you think of the great expanse of the battlefields that spring, if you look at the roads where the difficult task of fighting the enemy of humanity was accomplished, and if you consider all the enemy losses that spring, you will only conclude one thing: the Red Army accomplished here a victory of historical significance to the world. What international strategists and German generals thought impossible became feasible for the Red Army. Following in the footsteps of Suvorov and heeding Marshal Stalin's genius, the army of the Soviet people accomplished the impossible and paved the way for the liberation of Western Europe in 1944. Nothing could stop the Red Army, neither the will nor the tenacity of the enemy. This was an unprecedented feat. It was also as if nature fought a war of its own. Late spring blizzards were rampant. Ice was breaking. Rain was fighting snow. Steppes and roads became swamps. And again, blizzards, impossible to overcome. Our military overcame everything. Soviet hands took over when engines failed, as the long suppressed rage of the people erupted. From these kolkhoz fields, historic thunder was heard throughout the world. Here the all-powerful military skill of the Soviet commanders beat the seasonal military craft of the Nazis. Here millions of liberated Ukrainian brothers joined the Red Army. In a hurry, they said farewell to their children, cried over their tortured sisters, swore on the tears of their mothers and the immeasurable pain of their fathers. Taking weapons from their Motherland, they hurried to battle, men from Kiev, Volyn, Podolsk, Nikolayev. The spring of the victory on kolkhoz farm fields turned out to be as difficult as the victory itself. It was as if it exposed all the wounds of the Earth. Tractors were silent, and motionless sowing machines were a sad sight. Covered with trenches, holes, mines, and helmets, fields of the glorious battles looked grim. Fascism destroyed agricultural machinery, mechanical workshops, and farm animals. Brotherly republics helped Ukraine with herds and equipment, aided in rebuilding 1,200 garages and workshops. Help was generous, yet people were still plowing with horses and cows. Where there were not enough cows, people dug soil with their hands, harrowed with rakes. Old men taught their grandchildren the craft of plowing. All living generations came out to fight for the new harvest. Even this child came out, whose happiness millions of fathers defended on the battlefield. Ukrainian partisans were coming home from far-away battles, bringing good news. Hello, forever-worried Ukrainian mother! Welcome back your sons, contemporaries of Stalin. Hello, Papal! How happy we are that together we live in this glorious time, that we defended our home and our history under the banner of Lenin and Stalin. Nothing could stop us: not fire, not blood, not ruins. The lust for life is boundless in our people. Equally abundant is our sense of optimism, our willingness to work hard, and a desire to live. In Poltava alone, more than 50,000 living quarters are being built, as well as thousands of theaters and schools. Our mothers and sisters have a golden touch. In only a few years, there will be thousands of new friendly villages with orchards. The ominous ruins of our wounded cities will disappear. Kreschatik will arise from the ashes more magnificent than ever. The Dnieper will get new bridges. Monuments to the great people of our time will rise in public squares and on high hills above the Dnieper. They will hold weapons in their hands of bronze and will look far into the future. Power plants lied in ruins. Inakiyev plant, Stalin plant, Konstantinovsky, Voroshilovsky, Dniepropetrovsky, Kramatorsky, and Mariupolsky plants were destroyed. The huge Makiyevsky Metallurgic Plant was destroyed. It used to produce as much iron as Italy and Poland together. Concrete ruins replaced plants. Mountains of shapeless metal, debris, and crushed brick were everywhere. It seemed easier to build Donbass from scratch than to try to repair its open wounds. Soviet metal workers had the experience of Stalin's Five-Year Plans behind them. They did not run away from the ruins. The sight of destruction did not scare them. On the contrary, it made them want to rebuild everything as soon as possible to thwart all enemy plans. The Germans destroyed all machinery Donbass had been famous for. Coal miners once again had to work with the same tools they used 50 years ago. The first teams of construction workers brought their own rope, buckets, and tools. The first buckets of coal were heavy. Yet, people found courage to fight. In the middle of heavy fighting on the front lines, workers harnessed themselves into antediluvian winding barrels. Everything was useful: winding barrels, buckets, even carts. Save your coal, citizens. The Soviet State found resources to rebuild the metallurgical industry in the South. Krivoy Rog mines, Donbass, Kharkov and Dnieper plants, Zaporozhsky, Dniepropetrovsky, Mariupolsky plants, the industrial front began an immediate advance after the Nazi demise. It's not easy to find other examples of such feverish desire to heal one's wounds than the one shown by those rebuilding the metallurgy. Every day brings new examples of bravery that can only be compared to the courage on the front lines. Here again we see our women. Heroines of labor. Our mothers, sisters, girlfriends. They are more numerous than men. They are everywhere, rebuilding Donbass, the Dnieper region, in kolkhoz fields. They play a decisive role in all tasks of responsibility. No woman entered history with such well-earned glory as did our heroic Soviet woman. Everything required exceptional power. Miners of Donbass had what it took. With the help of the Party, the Government, and Comrade Stalin personally, they undertook the hard task worthy of our glorious time. Coal and coke began to flow into our victorious smithies. Blast furnaces came alive with fire. Iron started to flow. No one could be happier than the master-smiths who made metal and iron flow again. Steel is already moving east, to military factories in the Urals. Southern steel is gleaming, melting, getting forged into terrifying guns and tanks, and, like the iron will of the people, it moves west to finish off the enemy. This time will go down in history as a heroic time. For there is no plant in the country where workers and engineers are not performing magic daily. Step by step, foot by foot, victorious workers clean up the debris from factory floors. They push away the dead ruins of chaos. Each new day lifts their spirits and opens up new horizons. Here we see the pride of the first Five-Year Plan. The darling of the country, built to stand for ages, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. A fighter in the battlefield, a peasant in the field, a miner in his shaft, all want in their noble rage to fill these gaping wounds with Nazi bones. In the summer of 1944, the Red Army was far beyond the Dniester. Fascism did not die because of our boundless Eastern land. Our brutal Russian winters did not shake it. Sheer force vanquished brute force. The great Stalin family of Soviet peoples destroyed fascism. Our soldiers beat it in the battlefield by superiority of our weapons and by moral superiority. Here they follow the enemy, men from Moscow, Stalingrad, Novosibirsk, Poltava, Zaporozhye, Almaty, Chernigov, Minsk, professors of battle and terrible offensives. Men from Orel, Belgorod, Suma, engineers and workers of the war, masters and agents of victory. Fighting is raging near Lvov, near Brody, near Carpathian Mountains. They came a long way. They suffered great wounds and performed miracles. Let us get away from the battlefield for a while and follow the wounded behind the lines. Let us rejoice in the work of Ukrainian scientists. Let us visit Academician Filatov. This world-famous physician returns sight to many who lost it in battle. Lieutenant Aksyonov is on the operating table. Will he see the liberated world? They take bandages off of Lieutenant Aksyonov. Let's wish for a miracle. Silence. In staff offices, there is a quiet before the storm. The army commander was preparing to storm Lvov. General Moskalenko confirmed the last orders. Tireless Rybalko was chatting with tank drivers. General Krassovsky, aviation commander, talked to pilots. There was a meeting in the Staff Office of Cavalry General Baranov... ...and in the office of Tank General Katukov. Marshals Malinovsky and Talbukhin were getting ready to strike Romania. On July 14th, on the orders of High Command, armies of the 1st Ukrainian Front launched an offensive on Lvov. In three days they broke enemy lines and, by striking north and south of Brody, encircled all of the German Brody contingent. "Second division, fire!" "Seagull 8, this is Hawk 1. To your right is a squad of JU-87s. Attack them! Attack them immediately! Hawk 1 here. Over. Good! Great job! Attack him! Attack him! Attack! Get him! Higher! Higher! Higher! There! Good!" During the month of bloody work near Lvov, we had to destroy 140,000 enemy soldiers and take 32,000 of them prisoner. It was quite a fight. Only near Brody, we, soldiers of the 1st Ukrainian Front, killed 30,000 of them. 30,000 of them, and you would know it by looking at our wounds. We didn't spare our sweat, our effort, or our blood to free our Motherland. To think of what happened here! We were gone and came back. What a majestic expanse. Look at them, the masters of warfare. With what arrogance they strode! How they marched over Europe! How they drank up the wine of its vineyards! How they ate, pillaged, humiliated, and killed. Such fires lit their way to the East. The wind came full circle. The Prussian spirit withered in the Soviet fields. There are no more audacious fighters. The third-rate Übermensch is taken prisoner, a cross between a hangman and a gorilla. The arrogance of rank is gone. Their faith is lost. All strategic plans are lost. Hope is lost. Heads are lost. The bloody experience shows there is no future. They walked over Eastern "Lebensraum"” back and forth. The hour is near. They will tear off and hide their Iron Crosses. They will hide their wounds, like a convict hiding the brand that marks him. "Fascist" forever redefined as a swear word. In the middle of fighting for Brody, General Rybalko moved from Zolochev toward Lvov. Unexpectedly for the enemy, tanks appeared on the outskirts of the city. Baranov's cavalry crossed the Bug to Lvov. Following this, General Lelyushenko's tanks attacked the enemy. General Krassovsky's planes followed suit. The enemy is fleeing. Lelyushenko's tanks caught the enemy unawares from the southeast. Encircled, the enemy was destroyed in two days. On the morning of July 27, the army of liberation marched into the free ancient Ukrainian city, Lvov, welcomed by its citizens. In those glorious days the Army was hailed in Peremyshl, Stanislav, Belorussian cities, and in many cities of other liberated Soviet republics. These were no longer the naive boys of 1941. The punishing "university" of the war, the knowledge and experience garnered from such great events, the responsibility for the fate of mankind, left a special mark on the Soviet people. The sun was shining. Crowds were cheering in public squares. Marshal Konev and Head of Government Khrushchev pose with the people. They are on the stage. They salute the people who came to salute them on this memorable day. "Comrades! Dear brothers and sisters! Citizens of glorious Lvov! On behalf of the command of the 1st Ukrainian Front, I congratulate you on liberation from the Nazis." The Red Army fulfilled its patriotic duty with dignity. All of Ukraine was now free. The army walked up the Carpathian Mountains. When fighting was raging on the Dnieper, Kovpak's partisans were fighting their war here. They were few. But they were fearsome like prophets, bearers of the news of victory. Many of them perished. This handsome Russian man also perished here, General Rudnev. How beautiful are the mountaintops! From here, the roads lead to Berlin, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. It's a long way. Only history will be the judge of the greatness of the plan and the work of those who carried it out. The liberated Ukrainian people, now brought together with the rest of the Soviet family, got rid of the Nazis. From the Carpathians to Danube, beyond the ancient Dnieper, where our history has its source, and further East shines the banner of the great Lenin. Leaving behind fires and the chaos of destruction, we enter a Ukrainian orchard. This feels like a holiday, but the holiday still lies ahead. There are more battles to fight. The heroes come back to their loved ones only for a short while. To see in a dream your son sitting on the enemy's gun, your backyard, the smile of your wife, the street of your childhood. Lieutenant Ivan Noga from Chernigov fought on the Baltic Front for three years. Here the wish came true. His own street and his wife. She flies to him as if on wings. Forgetting everything, they remained before the camera as a happy sign of hope for all who fight. Bread for the army and for the people is not yet supplied by carloads. Half of Kharkov is still in ruins. Yet, in public squares of Kharkov, like in many other cities, the Ukrainian people show their creativity. Kolkhoz farmers come to celebrate the new harvest at the birthplace of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy near Pereyaslav. Mikhaylo Grom, a kolkhoz chairman and a former partisan, opens the festive meal. Hail to Stalin and to all humanity! Hail to life! Life prevails over death. Such is the universal law of being, like light prevails over darkness and reason prevails over madness. Good is the measure of life, not Evil. Love, not animal hatred. Otherwise, humankind would have long ago perished. The superiority of our soldier over the German soldier reflects the moral superiority of our people and our regime. Our soldiers are more courageous and more cultured. Our officers, our marshals, our generals are more talented and courageous in the art of warfare. Our women workers are dedicated, and so are our workers, our farmers, and the mothers of our children. The liberated Ukrainian people along with the Government of Soviet Ukraine are thankful to the great Russian people and other brotherly Soviet peoples for saving their sovereignty, for the victory, for bringing it to the forefront of humanity. The Ukrainian people hail the Red Army for its heroism and, at meetings of millions, it hails with a solemn oath the great name of its leader. The End
