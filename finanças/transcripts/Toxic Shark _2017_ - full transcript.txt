Come on, slowpoke! -Is that all you've got? -Hey, hey! -Come on. -Hey! I told you, you have to master one. Yeah, blame it on the engine... Hey, wait up! Alright, alright, you win. I'm sorry. What? I didn't hear. I said, you win. -This is a bad idea. -Yes, it is. No, really. We've been gone too long. What are you worried about? Your sister isn't going to think anything is going on. Look, this has been fun but this karma is going to come back and bite us in the ass, man. Fine, we'll head back, but... One more time? And that's it. -Deal? -Unbelievable. Yeah. Let's do it. Hey, Maggie, watch this! Yeah! Vince! Vince! Vince! Vince! -Vince! -Help, Maggie, help! My God. What happened? -Maggie. -You okay? Here, take my arm. Here.! Maggie? Maggie! TOXIC SHARK Subrip: Pix Hola, mamacita. And you thought this was gonna be a bad idea. No, this is a bad idea. This place looks like the first episode of one of those horrible dating shows. Come on, man, you said you wanted to do something to get your mind off your ex. Plus, none of us ever liked her, anyway. -She was toxic. -A singles' retreat though, man? I was thinking, like, Vegas or Tijuana even. Vegas is where you met Eden, stupid. No! No Vegas trip. This is Puerto Rico, baby! I can't believe you're bitchin' about this. Do you know how long it took me to save up for this trip? The phone company does not give out Christmas bonuses. Really, this coming from the guy who hasn't paid a phone bill in, what, eight years? Well, you fix the lines, you don't pay the fines. -I've never heard that before. -What're you guys talking about? I mean, look at this place. This place is beautiful! Yo, anyway, let's unload. Yeah, I need to hit the gym. My pecs are feeling kinda soft from the travel? There's no gym, dum-dum. The only thing soft on this island is your brain. Wait, what? You said this was a fitness retreat. It's a off-the-grid, rugged, campsite thingy, man just like we did when we were Boy Scouts but with girls, snorkels and girls. How'd I get talked into this again? Look, brah, girls and boats, your two favorite things. And if you're lucky, you're bound to go down on one of 'em. Yeah, bro! Whatever. Let's check in. It's reality-show time. Hey, think of it this way? It's a way to get your mind off of, what's her name? Eden. My ex-girlfriend's name is Eden, Ryan. -Yeah. -Good job. Hi there. Watch your step. This place is beautiful! -I like your shirt. -Thanks. We sell them. -Did you get the catalog? -Yeah. You know, the guys in here just got lucky now that you girls arrived. Great line. Come on, Eden, he's charming. Yeah, yeah. Charming. Alright. You girls are in the Gutanna group. Your cabin is just north over the hill. Gutanna group? Do we get color-coded buffs, too? Like, on "Survivor?" No? Am I the only one that still watches that show? Yeah. You know, this place is run by Reese. He's like a fitness superstar. Yeah, we read about that on the website. When are we gonna eat? -I don't know. -I'm hungry. But we got a chef from New York. He's really good. -Here? -Yeah, here. Just settle in, and in an hour there's gonna be lunch. It's gonna be, like, fresh crab, mango kale salad and something else. I don't know. What else is on the menu? I think this might be a good time to mention that I'm allergic to shellfish and pretty much anything else from the sea. Perfect. Hey, you sure I can't convince you to hang out for a couple of days? Listen, you like golf, right? Puerto Rico's got some of the most gorgeous golf courses in all the country. You know, another inspector might think you were trying to bribe me, Reese. That would mean I have something to hide but I passed, right? I passed. So what's the problem? The problem is the numerous complaints by former guests reporting sudden illnesses after staying at your... Come on, that's a bunch of BS. Listen, like I said, we offer a highly intensive physical and spiritual package. Sometimes the body is not used to a jolt like that. Listen, getting sick for a few days is just part of it. -Whatever you say. -They'll recover. Here. Take this. -What's this for? -Water-testing kit. Better for you to be prepared when you start hearing from the lawyers, I'd test the seawater every morning if I was you, before anyone goes swimming. Let's go. Have a nice trip. -Reese, come in. You there? -Yeah. You got the lunch figured out for today? No, Damiano and Gregory are supposed to be working on that. -If you say so. -Okay. Look at this, man. You see this? All my nets are ripped to shreds. I'm just gonna try it over there one more time. I don't get it. This is the third net today already. -That's messed up. -Yeah, this ocean stinks, man. I'm telling you, man, it's the same thing all over again. And what's the smell? I mean, is it you, me? I can't even tell anymore if it's a fish. -Geez. -Well, it's not me. I mean, if you showered more than once, maybe... Come on, Greg. Shut up. I used to be a chef in New York, you know? This is useless, man. We're not gonna catch anything here. I cook the fish, I'm not supposed to be, like ass-deep in this ocean tryin' to catch them. A week ago, all this area was full of fish and right now, what, they flew south or something? -I don't know. -You know, it's just like... -What the hell? -What? I stepped on a sea urchin or something. I'm done with this. You know what? I'm done! -What the hell, man? That's it! -Dude, what are we cooking? You know what? Make some tuna salad. I'm done. I'm not getting paid enough for this crap. You know? That's it. I'm going. Come on, help me! Greg! Hey, come on! Help! My eyes! It burns! Come on, help! Do your phones work? I have no signal. It was working fine in San Juan. Well, we are on a small island in the middle of nowhere. Bummer, you won't get to read your nerd books on your Kindle app while we're on vacation. I wouldn't mind being able to post selfies, though. Books, I downloaded earlier. You should try reading sometime. -Hey, city girls. -You guys wanted to disconnect. We are disconnected. I wanted you to stop checking to see if he texted every ten seconds. No, it's, it's, it's over this time. -It's done. Over. -It's fine. We were just making sure. Yeah, and anyway, you're like a crazy nature girl. You should love this place. Take a hike in the rain forest get some samples for your whatever. I study environmental science. -Exactly. -God. This place is like a tropical Tinder island. Yeah. Like the saying goes, "The best way to get over a guy is to get under another one." Seriously? Who says that? And that's exactly what we're gonna do. By the end of the week, you'll have completely forgotten about that loser. You didn't even like him anyway. Okay, well, you constantly bringing him up isn't helping anything. So how about you, Audra? You could use a little loosening up. I'm loose, so loose and... I'm super-loose, guys... Okay, you should probably stop saying that. -Those guys look so... -Fab? -Fab and... -Dumb. It's not like you have to start a book club with them. Domino, Gregory. Domino, Gregory, come in. Hello, where are you? Domino, Gregory! Have you seen Domino or Gregory? -Damiano? -What'd I say? Yeah, Domino. Damiano, yeah. I saw them head out to the dock, like, an hour ago. -What about you, Jesse? -No. Why? What's up? Hey, you, look at me. Look at me. What? What? Go ahead, spit it out. Damiano hasn't been happy in a while. Damiano's not happy. Well, those idiots better not have walked off like Neil did. Unsafe conditions, lousy accommodations. What do they think this is, a luxury resort? I mean, whatever happened to two-week notice? Those damn millennials. Pretty sure Damiano is, like, 40. -Hey, you're not helping. -Okay. Listen... we've got that meet-and-greet coming up. We've got nothing to eat. I got it. Why don't you two jump back here open up the fridge and see if you guys can throw something together, okay? -Really? -You got a problem with that? Where's your T-shirt? Where's your Bodies By Reese T-shirt? It's in my locker. I'll grab it. Yeah, I want you to wear that. You know what? Actually, scratch that. Why don't you go fix my boat? I was trying to start it this morning, wasn't working. I know nothing about boats... But you're a medic, right? -Yeah. -Medics fix things. -Exactly. People. -And you're a lifeguard. Which means you deal with things in the water. -Right? -What are you getting at? Broken boat in the water. Go fix it. Please. -Just go fix the boat. -Right on it, Reese. Listen, Erin, I was gonna do the "Puerto Rico!" or do you think I should do "Reese! Reese! Reese"? -Why... -You know what? Don't worry about it. I'll decide and... -What's the name of this island? -Culebrita Island. -Curberi, Curbi... -Culebrita. -You say it. -Right. Okay. Okay. It's the one on the north shore. -Gotta learn some Spanish, man. -Positive attitude, guys. -Positive attitude. -I hate you. The guy wearing a scarf in 90-degree weather is telling the medic to go fix the boat. -Makes a lot of sense. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Welcome to Bodies by that guy. Right now he's got the cook out looking for stuff to cook. -Do you see how this works? -Sadly, I do. -I'm not doing it. -I'll be back. Yup, you do that. You've got a workout at 3:30. Safety check. Fun stuff. Hey, mami. -Yeah. -Hey. Think this shirt's too tight? Is that a shirt or a sausage casing? Okay, good. Hey, what do you think? It looks great, Ryan, yeah. You know, just don't, like, flex or bend over or probably breathe. Alright. Hey, bogies coming in. Hottie at three. Maverick is engaging. I'm pretty sure that's 6 p.m. Yeah, he can't tell time. Wait, where'd you get that drink from? Cabana out front, man. Grab one. I'll see you at the beach. My God. I'm so sorry. I know, it's totally okay. I'm so sorry. And it's totally my fault. -My... -God. -Seriously? -You've gotta be kidding me. Did you follow me here? Why the hell would I follow you here? I came here to get away from you. I can't even believe this. I mean, what-what are you doing here? -Did somebody set this up? -Who would set this up? I don't know, maybe one of your dumb-ass friends. Okay, Calm down. They are not... Yeah, okay, you got a small point there. Yeah, but I don't think they would do this. I mean, you are literally the last person on Earth that I wanna see right now. Yeah? Yeah. 'Cause I was really hoping I'd bump into my crazy ex-girlfriend on a deserted island. -I mean, this is just crazy. -I'm crazy? Are you kidding? I'm sorry, Sam, that I have emotions something that you don't know anything about! Yeah, right. Emotional, crazy. Tomato, tomahto. -Right, Eden? -Okay. We're leaving, we're leaving. -Good. -We have to go. We have to go. -We have to go. -Did you forget? We're stuck here for a week. We have to kayak back alone. We can't just go, Eden. Plus, there's this guy, Mark. He's really cute. And we spent so much money to be here. Gross, right? Well, I'm not leaving. Well, then I'm not leaving. Okay? I'm not gonna let you ruin another vacation like you ruined Cancun. Cancun? And there it is. I got food poisoning, you psycho. How is that my fault? -I'm a psycho? -Yes. Are you kidding? I'm the psycho? I told you not to eat that octopus, but you had to get that stupid picture with the tentacles... Yeah, and you said you loved that picture... Alright, alright. Just everyone just calm down, please. Just calm down. Listen, if we all just realize the basic fundamentals of guys and girls, we'll all be okay. What are the basic fundamentals of guys and girls? This should be enlightening. Well, that's easy. Guys are dumb and girls are crazy. And if you guys would figure that out when you were dating... You guys are all idiots. Yes, girl, that's exactly what I'm sayin'. Okay. How 'bout this? Why don't we just stay and you guys just keep your distance? -Cool? -And that's crazy. -See? You're gettin' it. -This is not gonna work. -Surprise, surprise. -What is that supposed to mean? You know what it means, Eden. Shut up. Don't tell me to shut up, okay? . Du. Yeah. Yeah, easy. Bye. Are you kiddin' me, man? -Dude, what... -How? Reese, Reese, Reese! Reese, Reese, Reese! Thank you! Let me hear you say, "I'm single!" I'm single! Let me hear you say, "I'm sexy." I'm sexy! Yes, you are! Did you know, when a man and woman sweat together it opens up their minds? When a man and woman exert together it increases their sexuality their libido Latino. You swear you had nothing to do with that? -Dude, seriously? -I had to ask, man, just... Dude, I think Eden's here. -Yep. -You can't get that at a bar. -You can't get that... -Yeah, don't point, Ryan. Right here. Open up your mind to the positive possibilities and let's shift out the negative ones. You right there in the girl's shirt. Shift it out. -Who is that guy? -Shift it out. I've modeled with models from all over the world and I've competed with the greatest athletes of all time. And I've taken that information and mixed it up with social media, spirituality physical therapy, and I created this place. -Bodies By Reese. -Can I get a sip of that? -A singles' retreat. -No. For you. You, you, you, you, you and you. -Stop looking over there. -What? I don't know, man. I, I just had a premonition. I mean, I'm always right, right? Reese, Reese... Someone here... is gonna find that special someone... that they're gonna spend the rest of their lives with. -Let's get some. Yeah! -Yeah! My name's Reese. If you need anything, anything at all you come to me... through there. Mi casa su casa. Goodbye. -Yeah. -Thank you, Reese. Everybody, welcome to Bodies By Reese... where we will turn you into a piece in Culebrita, Puerto Rico! Yeah. Thank you! My name is Erin. Geez, is every boat on this island broken? "My boat won't work." What the... Okay. What the hell was that? Yeah, you know what? No. Yeah, man. That's what it's all about, you know? Wait a... Wait. Yo, I think that was Eden, bro. It's kind of funny, man. You okay? Because you seem not. -No, I'm fine. -Okay. Because if you're upset, you should talk about it. -I know you shut down... -No, I said I'm okay. Can we please stop talking about this? I'm just sayin'. It's uncomfortable. Yeah, I don't think I can get this off. What's that? It's a shark band. I'm terrified of sharks. Let me ask you a question, Zane. How'd you find out about this place? I read it in a magazine on your toilet tank. Yeah, you did? Yeah? Those are Eden's women's health magazines, you idiot. Dude. No wonder she's here. A shark band, like, one of those British spy things that tells time and sprays poison out of the base of it? No, no, it just has magnets in it. When magnets mix with the saltwater it creates this electromagnetic pulse. The sharks hate it and they swim away from it. You think it'll work on ex-boyfriends? You guys are not gonna let this go, are you? I'm not, but... Yes, I am because... This is all your fault. Thank you. Seriously, thank you. Dude, let me... Give me, give me. Just keep it on. My God, look at her, pretending to be injured so that two guys will carry her in. It's not the worst plan. I don't, I don't think she's pretending. What's wrong? God. Gabriella, what's happening? I don't know. Something grazed up against me. -What's going on? -Something in the water. I don't know, it was just so near. I looked at it. I thought it was the guys just messing around. Well, this looks really bad. We have to get her to a medic. -What could have done that? -Maybe some big jellyfish. Like one of those, those, carton things, you know? Carton things? You mean, box jellyfish? Yeah, whatever. I'm not a zoologist. -Neither am I. -Okay, I don't care what it is. -But it really hurts. Let's go. -Alright, alright. -Let's go. -Let's get her a medic, come on. Easy, girl. It's okay, girl. You'll love the water. What's with you today? It's okay, girl. What's going on? What's wrong? It's okay. What's happening? Careful. Are, are you okay? -I'm fine. It's fine. -Okay. I mean, what do you think has caused that? You said you brushed up against something? It could be a reef burn, we have a bunch of fire coral out there. She said it could be a jellyfish. No, it's definitely not a jelly sting. Okay, well, do you think that she's gonna be okay? I mean, I mean, maybe we should think about canceling the trip. Going back you can go to a real hospital... Eden, I know what you're doing. We're not leaving. Well, what if it gets infected? I mean, I'm online all the time. One minute, you have a scratch the next you're down four limbs and a spleen. Gee, thanks, Audra. I've seen crazier things happen. Maybe if you spend less time on the Internet. Yeah, you're not really helping the situation here. Relax, ladies. Just a minor burn. See? So when can I get outta here? I'd like to thank the guys that saved me. Well, I just need to wrap it up. It's still an open wound. Maybe some antibiotics. And stay out of the water. -Okay. I'll stay here with you. -No. -You go, have fun. -I'm not having fun anyway. Audra, can you go take her somewhere? I thought I came here with my friends, not my mother. I think there's a yoga class going on. Okay, I will go do yoga. Good. See you, guys. Hey, do you know where the yoga is happening? You missed it. They just left. But I have a high-intensity workout starting soon. Okay. -How's your friend doing? -She's fine. The medic said it was a abrasion wound or something? -Reef burn. -Okay. She's gonna be just fine. You got a second? Why don't you guys go down to the beach and I'll meet you there in a second? Okay. -What's up? -Walk with me. Did you see Gwen anywhere? She never came back from her horse ride for her meds and she's like Johnny-on-the-spot with those things. We're on an island. I'm sure she'll pop up. Or she walked? -Stop it, come on. -Seriously. So what? What are you thinking? Maybe I'm just being paranoid but when Reese the genius sent me to fix his boat there was something in the water and it almost tipped me over. Don't be stupid. You... We both know that Reese hasn't been making a lot of friends on the staff lately. Maybe they've been planning a walkout. A walkout? Really, though? There's only a few boats on the island one of 'em's broken. Where's everybody walking to? I don't know. -What do you think? -I don't know. I don't know either. But I do know if they were planning a walkout I'm a little bummed they didn't tell us about it 'cause now we're stuck here with Reese... Alright, alright. Let's not panic. -I'm panicking. -And let's not tell Reese yet. Until we have a better idea of what's happening here. It needs to be business as usual for now. Why don't you go out and see if you can track them down? Maybe they went out for a nature walk or something. Hippies. And exhale. Hands to the sky. Good. Hold. Let the oxygen cleanse you. Namaste. Nice workout, everyone. Come, follow me. -Alright. -Let's cool down. Come on. This water's great. Nothing better than this water. Alright, guys! Let's get started! We're gonna work up some sweat and those endorphins by doing a high-intensity workout with partners. Alright, so this is a pair exercise. So, everybody, reach in and grab a partner. Alright. Come on. -I got... -Everyone. Find your collar match. Come on, pair up. Come on, guys. Hurry up. Come on. Pair up. Of course. Does anyone wanna switch partners? No trades. That defeats the point of this exercise. What is the point of this exercise? Okay, so we're gonna start with some ball squats. Everyone, grab their partner, place the ball on your back... -Sorry. -No chatter. Social hour is in half an hour. Come on. -I'm not causing a scene. -Yes, you are causing a scene. -No one is freaking out. -Just do it. Right, so keep a straight back and do some squats. Would you go down at the same time? Can you hold on for two seconds? Give me... You know, when you're ready. I don't wanna rush you, Eden. We need to get on the same page. This is just like the time we tried to do that workout you did. "Can you please just slow down?" -Okay, first off, that's... -"You're going so fast." That's not how I sound. I'm sorry, that's just not how I sound. That's exactly how you sound. No, that's pretty accurate. -Okay? You ready? -You're so sweet. Thank you. -Are you ready? -I'm ready. Okay, let's go. One, two, three. -You didn't even go. -I... No, I did, too. I went. -I totally went. -I'm not gonna if you don't go. -Well, okay. -One, two, go. -Come on, guys. -Okay, see, look. This is easy. Could you please stop being a jerk for two seconds? -Fine. -Okay. -Are you ready? -Yeah. You didn't even ask about Gabriella, by the way. Why would I ask about Gabriella? Because she got really hurt in the water. I wasn't in the water. Why would I know that? Exactly, you were too busy flirting with all the girls on the island to notice anything else. Yeah, I was, actually, 'cause I'm a single guy. My God. And I'm on a singles' retreat! -It's kind of the point, Eden. -You're such a jerk. -Have fun being single. -Come on, guys. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, guys. No. This is done. I'm not doing this. Hey, bye, thank you. This is stupid. Once again. Keep your head in the game. Come on, guys. Good job. Gwen and Damiano just straight up disappeared. Where could they have possibly gone? -And Gregory. -They couldn't have gone far. Reese's boat is right there. -Just try her on the walkie. -She doesn't have one. What is this? I don't know. -What is this doing here? -Don't ask me. -What is that thing? -I don't know. I have no idea. Let's get outta here. Yeah. Beautiful. Help! -What is that? -That's a relay buoy. That's a ways away from where it's supposed to be. Can I get some help? This is the main phone cable that connects us to the mainland. Geez, Liam! I hate seaweed. Okay? Damn, that looks heavy. Well, this isn't good. No wonder we've been getting shoddy phone service. No kidding. Now we have none. That's great. How does that happen? Aren't they supposed to be underwater? Apparently not. Let's just go look for the others. We'll come back and deal with this crap later. You gotta just, like, forget about it. Pretend he's not here, you know? Yeah, easier said than done. -Hey. Let me see it. -Hey. God, don't be gross. Audra. That looks awful. Good luck getting any actual pus coming down your leg. You're even more disgusting than she is. Do you want a drink or something? You know what, I think I'm just gonna chill for a little bit. -Okay. -I'll meet you fools later. Do you want me to walk back with you? No, it's okay. I'll be fine. -Well, get some rest. -Yeah, feel better. Gabriella leaving the bar? Not good. -I feel bad. -Me, too. I can't believe we can't find anyone. This is literally insane. I've no idea where else to look. I wonder how many others are missing. What's that? That's one of our shirts. Geez! What the hell, man? That's Damiano's arm. Let's go back, guys. My God! Are you okay? -Hey. -I don't feel so good. Okay, okay, okay. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. God. Okay, that's it. We need some real help here. Hey, Reese! Reese! Hey, excuse me. Everything'll be alright. You guys go have a good time, please. Hey, we need to take her to medical. Hey, hey. Are you alright? -Reese! -Come on, get up. -Yeah. -Reese! -Take it easy, take it easy. -What? Walk her in, walk her inside. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Take it easy. What? We have a serious problem. Alright! Waves! Come on, let's go catch a wave! Do it, do it, do it! -Come on. -Yeah. Lookie. Yeah, man. -Come on, matey. -Let's go, go, go. Come on, dude! -Get up, get up, get up, get up. -Get out there, dude. Yeah. Get, get this one. -Come on the board! -Get on the board. Go, go, go. -Come down. -Something's got my leg! Hey, dudes, dudes! It was Damiano's. I swear it was him. I saw the tattoo on his hand. And I also found this marine test kit on the dock. You ever seen it before? No. -I'll look into it. Thanks. -God, Damiano. I'm telling you, guys, there's something not quite right going on out there. So what are you saying? It's a shark? -Well, I don't know. -We need to evacuate everyone. -Over a shark? -Yes. Come on, sharks live in the ocean they have rights, too, besides I can't afford that bad publicity right now. -Look at her, Reese! -She looks fine to me. -She's sleeping like a baby. -What? My God. She needs to be airlifted out of here ASAP. Airlifted? Who could afford that? There must be some poison component in whatever scraped her, because she's having a really bad reaction to it. And I don't have the resources to diagnose or deal with it here. Yeah, and I can't make any calls. My phone won't work. Look, that's just a temporary outage. It happens all the time here on the island. It's not temporary, Reese. I saw the relay buoy washed ashore. The entire main line was corroded. -Are you joking? -This not a joke! We have a dead employee, others are missing and we have a girl with some inexplicable injury caused by something in the water. We need to get her to a hospital. Will you settle down? Just settle down. Can you start thinking of the positive possibilities that shift all the negative ones... -Okay, okay, so what's next? -You breathe, breathe. I want you to breathe. Breathe. You ready? Okay. I got it, we'll remove everyone from the ocean and we'll get everyone started on land activities, okay? Okay, that's genius, but we're on a beach retreat, Reese. So how are we gonna get everybody out of the water without telling them what's going on? Tell 'em it's, some kind of toxic algae bloom. -Tell 'em it's organic. -My God. You both know that there's tug of war in the water right now. We need to get everyone out! Can you just listen? Let's go. Open your eyes, man. Just don't say shark. You can't beat me at this, bro just like you never could in grade school! I am and always will be stronger and better than you, bro, every time. He must have eaten a lot of paste when he was a kid. Yeah, I think the steroids are shrinking more than his nuts. Come on, Ryan! Come on, big man! I'm a beast! You can't beat a beast, brah. -Yeah, you can. -He's like a cartoon character. Come on, beast! Three, two, one... Poor baby. -Audra, you're worthless. -Sorry, Audra! Sam, what happened to your muscles, Sam? Everybody get out of the water! Hey, everyone, get out of the water! -Hey! -I said, get out of the water! Hey, calm down, calm down! Please come out of the water calmly we have an announcement to make. Shark! Get out of the water! -Run! -Get out of the water! Take her! Come on, come on. -Guys, where's Ryan? -Shit. I'm chained to this boat, bro. Ryan, come on, get out of the water! -I can't! -Ryan! -I can't! -Ryan? Ryan! Reese, go. Go, go, go! Ryan! Sharks? This isn't what I signed up for. Hey, just give me 24 hours, please. Jesse. Hey, I need more towels. More towels. There's some in the medical cabin. Keep pressure on that. I'll be right back. -How are you doing? -What the hell, guys? -What the hell? What the hell? -I mean, what was that? It was a shark! What the hell do you think it was? I've seen sharks. That wasn't a shark. Well, it sure as hell was acting like a shark. Well, who cares what it was? We need to get off of this island. And I don't think that idiot's gonna do anything to help us, okay? -I'm gonna go check on Gabby. -Okay. Hello? Hello? Yeah. I... Please, can you... No, I... Damn it, I can't stay connected to anyone! Just keep trying, it's a temporary outage. Maybe it's time to rethink this whole off-the-grid strategy. What do you mean, "This off-the-grid..." Can we start thinking positive, please? I mean, let's get these people off the island. Look around here, Reese, and help me help you. -At least act like you care! -What? You think I don't care? Of course, I care! You don't think I care? Hey. Don't I care? You're having a good time, right? I care. Don't I? Of course I care! You're having a great time. Really hope that these guys are coming up with a plan to get us out of here. -I doubt it. -Don't I care? Of course I care. I want to put this thing together. I can't find Gabby. -Gabriella. -Stay back. How long has she been here? -What? -Wait. W-what is she saying? -What's wrong with her? -She broke out in a fever. She keeps rambling on like she's tripping out or something. No! No! -Stay down. -You guys suck! I get to be the lead dancer. What? Gabriella? What is she talking about? Lead dancer? We haven't danced since we were, like, nine. What's happening? She's showing signs of a really bad infection. What kind of really bad infection? I don't know, but it's clearly infecting her brain? You don't know? Are you even a real doctor? I'm a medic! For a retreat that just had a massive shark attack, okay I'm a little stressed and-and a little overwhelmed! Well, that's our best friend, so... Okay, is it possible that that shark or whatever grazed her leg, it maybe it had some kind of poison or-or toxins that got into her bloodstream? So wait. What, it's like a toxic shark, Eden? -I don't know. -Maybe, I don't know. It sure looked toxic to me. However, we need to get her to a real hospital. -Okay? -Yes, we do. We're trying to figure out how to do that. I can't get through to call for help. We can't just bring her ourselves? We need to get the hell off this island, man. -I know. -All of us. It was all those years of polluting the ocean, it's finally come back to bite us. Literally. Let's just focus on the shark and our injured friend here, Eden. Zane is right. We can't just stay here. We can't just kayak back, not with that thing out there. Alright, settle down. Settle down, let me take a look. She looks alright, can't we just wait till after the weekend? No! Get her off me! Get her off me, get her off me! Okay, okay, okay. This is gonna ruin me. Okay, okay, I got, I got two working boats. One working boat. You didn't fix the boat? Alright, I got, I got, I got one boat. I can take her and a few of the others and then I'll come back and get the rest of you if you wanna get back to the mainland. -Okay. -Okay? We gotta make it quick. It's low tide right now. I'll push the boat out, you get the girl ready, meet me there. It'll take about 30 minutes to get there and back. -Alright, hurry up. -Come on. -It's okay, Gabby. Come on. -You're gonna be okay. Come on, let's go. -It's too shallow. Just hurry. -Give me your hand. -Come on, let's go. -You should go, you and Audra. -What about you? -I'll be okay. -Just make sure Gabby's okay. -Whatever. -Here. -Get 'em the boat. -What is she doing? -What the hell? Dang it! -My God! She bit him! -Come back. This is some crazy stuff. What's going on? -Gabby? Gabby, no! -You alright? -G-get him in the boat. -Sam! -You okay? -Gabby. Gabby, what are you doing? Stop. It's me, it's Sam. -Man. -Look at me, stop. Please, Gabby, stop it. Come on. Get him in the boat. Please, please, stop, please, Gabby. Look at me. Stop. -What are you doing? -Get off the water. -Stop playing. -Come on. -My! -Get off the water! Go up! Eden, give me your hand! Get off the water! -Hurry up! -Reese! I'll shoot it with a flare gun. No. What do you mean, shoot it with a flare gun? Come on, come on. Come on. -What's he doing? He's leaving. -Yeah. -Stop! -Reese! Reese! -Where's he going? -Where is he going? -Dang it! Reese! -No! We should be taking 'em with us. Come on. I'm trying to get us outta here. Hey, shut up! Will you? What's-what's going on? -Shit. -Come on! -Come on! -I'm trying! I'm trying! -Here, take the controls. -Take the controls? I don't know anything about boats. -What do you want me to do? -Hold the wheel. -Are they coming back? -Yeah, come on! -Come on, come on, come on! -What are they doing? Alright, on three, turn the gas. Pull the switch. I'm trying. . Not now! -No. -Shit. No! -No! -No! No! -No! -No! -No. No. -No. My. -No. No. -My God. Audra. Eden? Eden? Wait. This is Sam. What are we gonna do? Audra was on that boat. Eden, what? What? Eden, spit it out. -Spit it out. What? -Wait. -Wait. -No, no, no, no! Stop! -Eden, Eden, Eden, come on now! -Stop, stop! -Eden, Eden! -Eden, come here! -No, stop it! -No! Don't be crazy! Don't be stupid, Eden. -Audra! -God. Audra! She's right there! Audra! Audra! -Come on. -I got you, I got you. Come on, come on. I got you. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on. CPR. -It's okay. -Lay her down flat. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit down. It's okay. Push this button until I say stop. Okay, okay. I'm gonna go and get everything under control and get everyone back to their cabins. Good idea. Go find Liam and Hayden. -Please use your walkie. -Right. Will she be okay? She's not okay, she's infected. -It's-it's not good. -What, infected? That fast? -How do you know that? -See where it is? It's closer to the brain it moves really fast, just like rabies. -We're so screwed, man. -That's good. -What the hell are we gonna do? -Dude, calm down. You're not helping anything. You're the girl devil. -You're the devil! -No, Audra, Audra, calm down! I'm Eden. I'm Eden, okay? You're Audra. You're gonna be okay, alright? Yeah, yeah, Eden. -Okay, Eden. Yeah. -What the hell was that thing? I've never seen a shark like that, man. Yeah, great, 'cause there's more where the great white shark spits toxic waste! Hey, listen. Of course, it matters, okay? But you need to calm down 'cause we need to get outta here. Calm down? Calm down? What are you talking about? -People are dying, man! -Will you stop yelling, please? Stop it. -It's okay. -It's okay. You will be fine. Liam, Hayden, you got them? Everyone who is not here, back in their cabins. Okay? Alright, everybody, listen up. We are working on an evacuation plan so everything's gonna be fine. We just need you guys to stay inside your cabins at all times until further notice. I'm gonna go back upstairs. Hayden, I got an idea. Okay. The thing is, guys, there's only one boat left and it's not working. It's leaking and something... So why don't we just fix it? I have no idea 'cause I am not a boat guy. Even if we did, getting on that boat would be a suicide mission. We all saw what happened to the other one. That's true but what if we're prepared? -That could work. -Okay, so we get the boat going. We weapon up and we fight our way to shore. Yeah. Who's volunteering for that? I will. What? Sam, no. W-what if it doesn't work? It probably won't. Okay? We need to focus on getting the communication fixed. That would be great, except the emergency landline is fried. Yeah, the cable washed up. It's a mess. If you fix the lines, you don't pay the fines. What's that supposed to mean? Phone company lineman. It's, like, my day job, dude. Wait, you do underwater landline wiring? Hell no, not underwater. But I guess, it's the same principle, right? Okay. Alright, Zane, why don't you go with them, see if you can fix that line. -Cool. -And I'll grab the scuba gear. -The what-a gear? -Calm down, he's joking. -It's not that deep. -Okay, we have walkies. Make sure you use them. Thanks, bruh. It's alright, man. Hey, you don't look so good. -Hey! You alright? -I'm okay, I'm... I don't think I'm infected. Hey, Jesse, can you show me that other boat? Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, I'll go with you guys. Hey, stay with Audra, make sure she's okay. Yeah, okay. Hey, what do you know about boats? My parents have a house in Cape Cod. I grew up on boats. Okay, can you guys just please hurry? You keep this prick on her side of the room. That's not good. Actually, it's an easy fix. The engine looks fine. We just gotta patch up that hole and pump out the water. Hey, Jesse, you can get me a water pump? What's it look like? It looks like a pump, dude. -I got it. -Yeah, that's it. Now we just gotta find something to patch up that hole. Yeah, we need a repair kit. Wait. What in the hell? What? What is it? The hull. Looks like something ate through the bottom. Ate? Corroded. This boat isn't that old, doesn't make any sense. Not that anything does today. That shark. It's spewing out some kind of toxin into the water. Something that can eat away at the hull of a boat? It drifted pretty far. I thought you guys pulled it in. We did, it must have drifted back out. Must have? Well, I guess that's that. -Let's go back. -Come on, man. We got these, and the water is clear. What are you smoking? I'm not going back in that water. Hayden, just keep an eye on me. I got you. Seriously? My God, you guys are so dumb. Here you go. Damn it! God! Come on, Zane, you can do this. You can do this. Don't let no fish destroy you, man. Come on, you gotta get out of this island. Alright, alright, okay, alright. Alright. You got this. Alright. Just so you guys know, this is stupid. Even for me. Let's go. You guys know there's a shark out there killing people, right? Craziness. This water's cold. Man. Every boat should have one somewhere. Jesse, check in the back. You know what? Let me radio Eden. Eden, come in. Hey, I-I-I'm here. Are you okay? Yeah, we're fine. Can you find a repair kit? A boat repair kit? That shark is corroding anything that sits in the water long enough. I'll try. There might be something here. -I don't know. -I'm not going back there. And you can't make me. Sam, I gotta go. Jesse, any luck? It's okay, it's okay. I have to find something to help you sleep. It's not fair that we need to share a room. No! You clean the damn room! I'm not covering for you again. What's this? Audra? I'll be right back. Keep a lookout for that shark, man. Is that a jellyfish? Let's go under. Over here. -You got it? -Yeah, I got it. But this thing is beyond repair, guys. Let's get out of the water, yeah? If you wanna bring it back, come on. Shark! Let's go! -Liam! -Hayden! -Liam! -Help me! -Hayden! -Liam! -Liam! Liam! -Hayden! -Liam! -Liam! Liam! No, no! Let go of it! Man! We're going. My God, your leg. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. God! God! Come on, hold on. This is so... This is crazy, man. -What... Come on, hold on. -Liam. Liam! Liam! Liam, forget him! Of course not. Where are you? Where were you? Jesse? Hey, man, you okay? Jesse, hey. -That girl bit him, but... -Who are you to judge me? Jesse! I don't need you to judge... No. No! Good news is that it's temporary. You're too stupid to go to medical school. No, you're too lazy. Thanks. He was bit by your friend. Great. So that's the thing now. If it's anything like rabies, it would explain their behavior. -What are you doing? -I'm tying him up. We don't have time on the water. We'll leave him on the land. Let's just get him back to medical. God. Arsenic? Eden! -Where are they? -I don't know. -Come on. -Here, help him down. Pride goes before the fall. What? I was taking a bush pee and a humdinger of a horse fight. Dinged on my dinger! Eden, come in. -Eden? -Bobby! She forgot her walkie. -Alright, what do we do with... -Bobby! I don't know, he's the medic. No, Bobby. It's your turn to give Grandma her sitz bath. -Was that necessary? -Yeah, I think so. Jesse? What happened to her? God! I was aiming for the shark. It was right there. -I don't know what to do. -Wh-where's Liam? That thing, it got him. There's so much happening. Something that happened again. Yeah, I don't really know. Guys... This is so bad! -Yeah... -This is so freaking bad! -Hold it, come on. -I didn't mean this. "Minor cuts." "Burns stay through..." Can someone please help me with this? -Alright. Hold it. -I'm gonna find Eden. Hey, come on, be here. Calm down! -Help me. The dog is tied up. -So much blood. -Do you, you wanna... -Nope. You got it. Hayden, Hayden, listen to me. The, the harpoon is barbed. -I can't just pull it out. -What does that mean? It means that I, I have to... No, no, no. No, no, no. It's not that bad. It's not... No! -Be brave, alright? -Okay. Okay. Three, two! Come on! I'll show those bitches. Sam! Go, go, go! Go. Why the hell did it turn around? My bracelet, I think i-it doesn't like the magnets. What the hell is wrong with you? No, Sam, I was just trying to test it... You were just trying to what? You went in the water! No, I needed to get by the wreckage. -Why, why? -Stop, Sam. You always interrupt me. You never let me finish. It's like you hate me or something. I don't hate you, Eden. If I hated you, I wouldn't be in the water trying to save you. Is that from the explosion? No, they're-they're chemical burns. There's something different. Like, the other boat? No, that was, that was just erosion. This is something more violent. It's like chemical spraying or something. You even bring your work on vacation, Eden. No, it's-it's not mine. I got it from the equipment shed. -What is it? A pool kit? -It's not a swimming pool kit. You don't test for arsenic in a swimming pool. Eden... I'm sorry. -I'm sorry we didn't... -No, no, it's-it's-it's okay. I'm sorry, too. I still just can't believe this whole thing. I know, we just need to focus on the source. And how long has Audra been missing? I don't know. She was gone when I got back with Jesse. What happened here? Don't ask. -How you doing? -I'll be fine. -You found her? -Audra? I didn't see her. She's probably gone full Gabby by now. -What? -And him. -Zane, can he talk? -Yeah, but it's all crazy talk. And I'm not taking the tape off his mouth. He bites. -Yeah, I wouldn't get too close. -This is so screwed up. I don't understand what the hell is going on. -Go ahead, tell 'em. -Tell us what? Okay, so, we found this water-testing kit. And it's the same type of kit they use after there's been an oil spill or some kind of bio-hazardous leak from a chemical plant. Yeah, we found that at the dock. I knew it was too good to be true. Singles' retreat. All-inclusive hot girls? Pfft. Please. Okay, so it's just a theory but I think it's whatever's in the water that's making that shark toxic. Wait, we've been swimming on this beach for a really long time. How come we've never gotten sick? But we haven't been in the water long enough for the chemicals to have any long-lasting effect but i-if the shark bites us it's gonna get in our blood stream and then, well... -Then Audra. -Right. So this shark is oozing some concentration of arsenic. I don't know how it's immune to it but if it grazes anything, that thing becomes violent and crazy. And the first sign of arsenic poisoning, it's confusion and convulsion. So we need to get off this damn island. Is there any chance that Reese had a boat-repair kit somewhere? Yeah. There should be one around back by the tool shed. Okay. Sam, Zane, you guys get the boat fixed. -Eden and I will go find Audra. -Yes. Let's go, guys. Hayden, we'll be back for you. -What's takin' so long, man? -I'm almost done. -Doing a two-man job here. -I'm keeping lookout. Yeah, you could get your ass down here and help me. To hell with that. I ain't gettin' in this water again. Dude, I'm not staying on this island and getting that disease. I'm sure as hell not getting killed by that shark. We are leaving on this boat, so you get down here... Fine! God! You and your dumb girl problems. Give me that stupid paintbrush. Shit! What the hell! It's coming for us. Hold on. Zane! Zane! Come on, man. Zane! Zane, come on! Come on, man. Help me! No! No! I don't wanna die! Can't swim fast. Come on, give me your hand. Come on! Come on! Zane, come on! Come on! Come on. Yeah. Come out. Sam, it bit my leg. Man, I'm bleeding. Come on, get this thing started. Come on. Come on, let's go. This is what you've been waiting for. It's okay, man, hang on. Where are we goin'? I'm gettin' us away from the shark, man. But what about Eden and everyone? -I know, man. -Man... Let me just figure it out. Audra! -Audra! -Audra! Audra, it's Eden! -Where the hell is she? -I don't know. But it's a small island, she couldn't have gone that far. Well, if it's really arsenic poisoning, we don't really... -No, stop. -What? Well, I know what you're gonna say. And, no, I don't give up on my friends. Okay, that's really admirable, Eden, but you're wrong. What I was going to say is that maybe instead of burning daylight looking for Audra we should go to the boat and come back with the cavalry. Okay, but let's just check the cabins first and then we can double-back to the boats. Yeah. I just really hope they get that boat fixed. No, Sam grew up on boats. He knows what he's doing. Even if he does, with that shark out there, we might as well be in an inflatable pool toy. Yeah. What? Where do you guys keep your yoga equipment? So, what are we looking for? -These. -Therapy magnets? The ionization of the salt water with these magnets will send out an electromagnetic pulse that will drive the shark crazy. -Even a toxic one. -Are you sure? Well, all these small magnets, they saved my life. So, maybe with these big magnets, we'll have a shot. Okay. Can't this thing go any faster? -God. Zane, your leg. -I know, I know! Just keep going. Don't worry about my leg. -Here, just use this rag, man. -What the hell is this? This is disgusting. I don't care. Just tie it up. Come on, man, go faster. I know, dude. -This is crazy. -I don't know. -It could work. -I don't know, I just... Audra? Audra? Audra? Audra! Run! Run! My God, they're all in a frenzy! -Come on! -Zane, keep your eyes out. Do you see him? -I don't know, man. -No. Where did he go? -Damn, this shark is fast. -Go faster! Man, this is as fast as this little skiff will go. Come on. Well, there he is! Hold on, Sam. No. Are you kidding me? Did you date the shark, too? Come on, get it started! Man, I'm trying. This is a process. Hurry up that process, man! No, no, no. Come on, Sam. Come on, man. Hurry up! He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Hold on! Get down! Where'd he go? Sam! Sam, come in! Sam! -Zane, where did he go, man? -Who the hell cares, man? Just get it started so we can... Sam... Alright? What's that? Audra... -Eden, is that you? -Sam! -Are you okay? Where are you? -Look! We're back at the beach! Sam! Eden, run. Run, Eden. -Sam... -Run! Come on! God. Run! I mean, they're right behind you! Come on! -Keep your eyes on 'em, Zane. -Really? What else was I to do, take selfies? Run! Run! -You did this! -Audra! Come on! Swim! My God. Come on. Come on. -Come on, swim. -Come on. -Swim faster! -Come on, come on. -Come on. -They're right behind you. Come on! Give me the bag! I hope you're right about those. Yeah, me too. Did it work? I don't know. I don't see him. Guys, he's coming back. -Everyone, duck! -Watch out! Is it gone? -Anyone see it? -I don't. I think it's gone. But where'd it go? -Come on. -Come on, Sam. -Get this thing started. -I'm trying, man. -Try harder. -Come on, please start. Come on! Yes! Finally! Let's get out of here, dude. Everyone, keep an eye out. No, it's smoking. Yo, ease on the engine, or you'll blow it out. Man, we're running on fumes, so if we stall out we're dead in the water. The mainland's that way. I told you, dude. It's that shark goo, it's... Fire! Fire! -Alright, come on! -Come on. -Hurry! -It's not going out, guys. Throw out the water! Come on, keep throwing! That's just great. What are we supposed to do now? It's gonna start getting dark soon. Well, we're shark bait floating in the water like this. -What about the magnets? -Magnets? They might buy us some time but the shark's just gonna get more pissed off. -Yeah, swimming for it's out. -We're gonna end up like that. -That's Reese's boat. -Was Reese's boat. That doesn't inspire confidence, Zane. Do you think that flare gun is still down there? Down there? Maybe. God. What are you thinkin'? Whatever's in that shark, it has a ton of arsenic in it. -Who the hell cares? -Arsenic is highly flammable. -Okay? -Will that work? Yeah. I mean, it lit up that shark pus, so... -Yeah, why not? -What do we do now? We dive down there and hope to God it works. Right. What happens when our friend decides to swim back up? You guys think this is a good idea? No, but it's all we got. Come on. Are we ready? One, two, three. Okay, but just go slow, Sam. Ready? God, it's back. Zane, it's back. God. Zane. Zane! Get off! Give us your hand! Here. What happened to Zane? I'm sorry, I... He tried to bite me. Look, Sam, okay, we need to focus. Okay? Because that thing is in a frenzy. Once it's done with Zane, it's gonna come right back for us. Come on! -Alright. -There's only three? Yeah! Make 'em count. Come on. Hurry, Sam. No! Shit! Come on. Come on. Here it comes! Load the gun Sam, hurry! Okay, wait till it gets closer. Hold... Hold... Hold... Now! Shit! No, he's coming back. Come on. Come on, Sam. This is our last flare. Take this shot, Sam. Erin! Where'd she go? We're out of flares. Here! Take the magnet. There. -Come on. -Come on. Come on. Where's he? -Look! -God. God. One, two, go! -I found the shell! -Come here! Give it! Smile, you toxic son of a... We got it, guys! -My God. -Is everybody okay? -Yes. -Yeah? Good shot! Somebody had to do it. -Grab on to something. -Okay. -Have to swim for it. -Alright. Let's just take it slow this time, okay? Okay. Okay. -I'm just glad we're alive. -Yeah. No! Subrip: Pix
