So? See anything yet? What do you see? Say something or give it to me. Is it even the right way around? Otherwise things will look like they're further away. If you shut up for a second, I can concentrate... And I might see one of your sisters on the quay showing her twat. I'm jumping the first white woman isee. So, you better tell your mothers to get off the quay. Open your trap again and I'll knock your teeth out, so even your mom won't recognize you. - I think I see something! - Do you see the harbor yet? It's jam packed with naked chicks, right? It's a boat. Some kind of dinghy. A boat full of hookers, I hope. Is it the red cross nurses? No, just citizens. They're holding banners and drums. I can hardly see a thing in this fucking fog. Do you hear that? Quiet everyone! It sounds like a marching band. It's not a marching band. Look out! Murderers free the indies murderers free the indies filthy Nazis child killers the east Welcome to the indies, my friend. Homesick. Who? You or me? That's what they call them here. The ship's chef smoked them. Homesick cigarettes. Mattias. Johan. I'm from haarlem. - Arcen. In northern Limburg. - Right. There was some good fighting there, it was crawling with filthy Nazis. Name. Johan Leonard Maria de vries, sir. - Number and unit. - T-brigade, 4th regiment driebergen. Date of birth. July 6, 1926. You're going to semarang, b-division. Tropical gear! One pair of shorts, one long. Two shirts, one short-sleeved. Sign here, please. One standard smle rifle. Tropical handbook. Memorize every word. It will reduce your chances of a one-way ticket home in a wooden suit. Nexfl so? Where are you going? - Semarang. - Me too. It's supposed to be quiet there. Yeah? I hope it's not too quiet. Don't throw your pants in. Semarang, right? A tailor there will turn them into two pairs of shorts for cigarettes. You'll need them in this heat. How do you know? My brother was one of the first. He's been there for ten weeks now. My name is major penders. On behalf of her royal highness, queen wilhelmina, I welcome you to the indies. The journey was long, the sacrifice great, but soon your actions will bear fruit. Because, thanks to our American allies, the Japanese Nazis have recently been kicked out. But has this brought back peace to the indies? No, no. Has it brought back peace to the indies? No! - Not yet! - On the contrary. The Japanese poison has already spread through our beautiful colony. The same poison... That has also entered the Japanese puppet soekarno's mind. Filthy bastard! Soekarno, yeah. That coward. The terrorist, who struck once the indies were freed... From the awful years under the Japanese. The bastard who sent his thugs into the country to kill, plunder and rape. Not just the whites and Chinese. Even their own compatriots... Who admitted they yearned the return of the Dutch... And the peace and prosperity they would bring. It's a disgrace. But that disgrace ends today. The disgrace ends with your arrival here! Look, look! Do you see that? Not bad, is it? Not bad! Four months ago, I'd never even been out of overijssel. Man of the world! Real lucky strikes? Where did you get those? I know someone who knows someone here in the harbor. Want one? Take one, a whole pack is 2,50. Three for five guilders. Hey, Johnny weismuller. A big guy like you must be hungry. Am I right? I'm 0k. - How much is that? - Two cans for a guilder. Never mind then. You wait, after two months of eating only rice, you'll change your tune. And the library is open for business too, horny bastards. Give that to me. Hey Nancy boy! - Are you kidding me? - So, what is this? Well, here he is! Do you still have some muscle on you or not? Did you guys eat any meat on the boat or not? You're in hut a. Be thankful it's brand new. There was nothing when we came here. We had to build the roof over our own heads. The fucking japs destroyed everything. I found a tiger with its cub in hut c. It scared the shit out of me. Three things are very important. First thing: Taking a shit. Back there are the latrines. If you need to take a dump, do it before 10 am. It can reach 50 degrees in there in the afternoon. A few guys passed out. They woke up with their heads in their own shit. You can also go outside the camp in the bushes, but then you risk getting stabbed in the ass by a rebel. Like one soldier near priok. They found his headless body three days later... With a dagger six inches deep up his ass. His pants still around his knees. What about that? You can't even take a shit in this country. Absolutely. The second thing is washing. Twice a day, or you'll have all kinds of rashes and worms in no time. Our white bodies were not made for these temperatures. Or at least not to work hard in them. Did Werner tell you about the shorts? Yeah. Okay, good. - Hello. - Hello! The third thing is the most important, so listen up. Don't trust anyone here. Those darkies would rather see us leave. You would expect some gratitude. We came here to help them. Absolutely not, I can tell you. They'll smile and wave as you walk past... Only to go inside to work on the bomb they'll be putting under your Jeep that same night. Aren't those flak air defense guns? Someone has been doing his homework. - Are they broken? - No, they're fine. Quality equipment, really powerful Nazi stuff. Sent with us on the ship by the gentlemen in government. Why aren't they being used? We're fighting peasants with swords and Spears. The idea these monkeys could run their own country is the only thing we can shoot down. This is alright. These beds are taken, ladies. Resistance members get first pick. - Says who? - Says me. Can't you read? What does it say? Two stripes? I've forgotten what it means. It doesn't mean you can pick any bed you want. Or that you have to act like a dick. Piss off, will you. Move on, if you want to sleep with your girlfriend tonight. What did you say? I said you should move on if you and your girlfriend want to sleep in the same bed tonight. Come on, what's up? Attention! Salute! At ease! Gentlemen, welcome to camp matjan liar. You've had a long day, so I'll keep it brief. My name is mulder and this is my camp. It's a new camp, so it's clean and I want to keep it that way. This is a dirty country, but we don't have to live in squalor. It's dinnertime soon, at 1900 hours. After that, there's leisure time until 2100 hours and then it's lights out. You'll need your sleep tonight because, tomorrow morning, you'll start patrols in three groups. - Lieutenant. - These patrols are essential, as they reassure the locals we're here to protect them... And to rebuild the country together. Prince bernhard has seen to it... That your mail was delivered by air this morning. At ease. Name? - Name? - Cohen. Mattias. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Name? - De vries, Johan. Sorry, de vries. Nothing for you yet. Maybe they've gone to the wrong camp. De val, Werner. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. That's why we stand here before you today. We ask you for strength to carry out the task... We, as christians, have been given and have accepted. A strength that keeps vigil over us, so far from home, but at the same time connecting us. So that every day we realize... That we 're here to help both christians and pagans. As in every pagan lurks a Christian who hasn't yet discovered himself. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Aren't you one of the new boys? You got any cigarettes? Can you take over? Any action tonight? I've been here for three months. I haven't seen one rebel yet. Why are you on the ground, if you're not afraid of snipers? 0h, they're there. They come in the middle of the night and fire from the bushes. As soon as they've fired, they're gone. And everybody living here hasn't heard or seen a thing. God damn it, it's so fucking hot here. I'd like a nice cold beer, you know? How long since you had one? Tell us! Yes, tell us! Is father janssen with us? Why? Is this not a Christian story? It's going to be a dirty story, is it? The night before we left, my dad took me to a bar in Amsterdam. He did the same with my brother. He thought that we should get drunk and fuck a good broad at least once before coming here for a few years. Your dad took you to a hooker? And did he pay for you, too? Yes, he'd heard stories about the women here. So, how was it? Tell us, from the beginning. Well, we arrived in Amsterdam by train and couldn't find our lodgings... Not that, you prick. Start with the whore. I picked one in the red light district. - Was she sitting in the window? - Yeah. So, what did she look like? She had this huge blond hair. She looked a bit like Rita Hayworth. Sure! After ten beers, they all look like Rita Hayworth. Even janssen would look like her! Go ahead, laugh. What were you doing that night? Half of you were probably in bed crying, getting tucked in by mommy. That's what I thought. After we negotiated a price, my dad paid and I went in. She closed the curtain and told me to undress and sit on the bed... While she put on some music. What kind of music? I don't know, some slow negro music. It's called jazz, Werner. If you say so. Then she took off her clothes and stood in front of me. She took my hands and put them right on her breasts. So nice! Was it nice? It did feel good, yeah. After that, she moved my hands down, over her belly, all the way down between her legs. Then she started to rub her pussy up and down against my two thumbs. Christ, that is simply divine! Did it get her a little wet? A little is an understatement. I thought I was back at the barn. I grabbed my stool and bucket, and filled it up. And then? Then she grabbed my head and pushed it against it. Right in my face. What? She pushed your face into her pussy? Werner, whatever you do in this country, promise me one thing: Don't ever eat a whore's pussy. Sir. In the last few days, have you seen any suspicious people around here? There's nothing to be afraid of. We are here to help. We will lock up and prosecute the terrorists that harass you. No, sir. I haven't seen anyone. The guy doesn't even know what century it is. I guess the welcoming committee overslept. Darling. Darling. Is everything 0k, sir? Is there a problem? There's no problem. Have you seen anyone suspicious here? No, sir. Nobody. According to our sources, armed men come here all the time. If it's true we could wait here awhile and see if anyone turns up. No need, sir. Everything good here. - You're sure? - For sure, yes. My men are thirsty. Drink. Oh, drink. Coconut. Child, pick the coconuts. Hurry, hurry! At ease! Look. They're just like monkeys. Thank you. Hey! Good people! - How are you doing? - We can't complain. Has it been quiet here? We've been under heavy fire the last few nights from a group of stealing, screaming monkeys. - How long have you been here? - Here? Three months. - Many patrols? - None. We just guard this plantation. Really? Apparently, it's strategically important. Sure. For the treasury. The japs made this their head office. The bastards knew a good thing when they saw it. They just left everything behind like this. Probably hoping the locals would find it and use it against us. Some of these weapons have never even been used. Good stuff, this. - What a life these people had. - Certainly did. - I think about it sometimes. - About what? Staying here when we're done. Why not, right? Grow some tea, get me a nice local girl, have some kids. Disturbing the peace, right. Try it! It's like pork, you should try it. He walked the cobbled streets I don't trust it. For months and the future offered him no livelihood his parents... Tastes good. Who barely got by called him a freeloader, who had never done a thing then he signed up for the colonies out of desperation, he signed the papers they waved him goodbye from the quayside and he was heard humming softly on the boat far away from everything that I have loved I wander around in absolute loneliness and the one I love I will never lay eyes on again don't forget me and think from time to time of me for a moment here in foreign lands Let go. Let me go! Let go. Let me go! I want to talk to the soldiers. What's going on? - This boy wants to speak to you. - What does he want? There were men in his village last night, and you need to go there right away. They came to the village, you have to come with me. Tell the men to pack their stuff, we're leaving in five minutes. Highest state of alert, this could be a trap. God damnit. Do we know who did this? Lieutenant says they're miles away in the jungle, we'll never get them. So we're not going after them? No. That's not right, is it? How will these people ever trust us, if we don't even try? We shouldn't have stopped here yesterday. - I'll talk to hartman. - There's no point. The orders came from up high. Try to get some sleep. There's nothing more we can do here. Hopefully, they'll have found your letters by now. There won't be any letters. Back home, everyone is dead. Your hair is long. You won't get your job back looking like that. Don't worry. They have to give all volunteers their jobs back. Or half of us wouldn't have gone. It doesn't mean you have to look like that. They never liked us here. Twenty five meters, de vries. Not bad! Not bad, hendriks! Is this free? Yes. I studied in the Congo for a year, but this humidity is the worst. How are you doing? I'm 0k. Are you sure? Why? - Is this a confession? - No, it's not. But know that we don't need a church for that. If you have questions or something you've seen here bothers you, I'm here for you to talk to. The only thing that bothers me are the things I don't see happening here. - Can I have lontong, please? - Yes, sir. And can I have some pecol? - Pecel? - This is pecel, sir. Pecel" - please go. - Yes, father. She doesn't want you! Thank you. All those fancy words you memorized and you're still not getting laid. If I had a daughter like that, I would keep her to myself, too. He would. - What do you want her to do then? - Fuck you? Hey, hey! What's going on here? They want to steal my stuff. - Shut up, you! - Calm down, calm down. De vries, get over here! This is none of our business. All back on the trucks! Hey, are you deaf? What's going on here? This man says the japs are stealing his stuff. Who do you think you are? Weapons down. Take the things down. Who was that? The turk. They call him the turk. They say he doesn't answer to anyone. Half Greek, half Dutch. Grew up in Istanbul. He reported to London at the start of the war to liberate the Netherlands. In the next four years, he followed every British Navy training program. Let me tell you this. If he was in charge, we'd be home in a few months. He lives close by. On the main road in a normal house. He's not afraid of anything. Johan! Johan de vries! Yes, I thought that was you. Tell me, what the hell are you doing here? Doing my duty, like everyone else. Then you have quite a lot to make up for. Why would they consider recruiting... I've gotta go. Good to see you. Who was that? No idea, someone trying to sell something. I have no clue what kind of beer this is, but they're selling it for ten cents! Waiter! Bring us more beers. Looking for something special, gentlemen? I hope tonight will be the most enjoyable night for you all. Are you coming with me? Serve the gentleman well. Werner! Remember, don't eat the whore's pussy! Yes, alright. Go, quick. Serve him well. Yes, absolutely. What about you, sir? Are you going to choose? - How old is she? - 15 years old, sir. - 15 years old? - Yes. Sorry. Gita, come here quickly. What's your name? Gita. Men, today is your lucky day. You have a three-day patrol through klewang sawah territory. Didn't group 2 go there last week? - Any problem with that, Cohen? - No, sir. Then stop interrupting me and go pack your goddamn stuff. Report back here in 15 minutes. Corporal coolen is in charge. - Have you seen any rebels? - No, sir. You. What is your name? - Gatot. - Gatot? - Are you lying, gatot? - No, sir. Where are they? Don't be scared. Just point on the map. Where are they? Don't you ever wonder what we 're doing here? It's been three months and I haven't seen one rebel. I wouldn't mind keeping it that way, personally. I didn't come here because I enjoy long walks. It's enough that we're here. It gives people hope. You really believe that? No. But that's what they tell me, so I guess that's what I'll believe. It's turning into real weak coffee, right? - Come on then! - Once again! Do we even know where we are? Where is the river? I'm going to talk with coolen. - River? - River? Corporal, the men are wondering if everything's alright. Of course it is. We just missed a crossing a few miles back. - Are we going back? - No. We'll make it up by crossing more to the west. Take your knife out. Yes, that's it! - Another one without the helmet! - Damn it. Supefl didn't you use maps in the resistance? Who asked you? This bridge was blown up a year ago. That's why we took the galingi last time. You'll be sorry for this when we get back, de vries. Take it easy, brother. I'll buy you a beer later, ok? Come on. Bridge or no bridge, we're crossing here! If anyone sees a pike, tell me. I'll throw it in the pan tonight. With butter, pepper and salt. Damn, I think I just cut my foot. You should've kept your shoes on, Werner! Yeah, yeah. And then walk for ten more miles in soaking... Hey! Who got shot? Where are they? Medic! Fall back! Fall back! Come on. Come on now. Stay with me. It'll be okay. Hey, look at me! - I'm going home right? - What do I need to do? - Keizer? - Keep the pressure on. Keizer, hurry! Keizer, come on! - I'm going home right? - It'll be alright. Is it bad? Is it bad? No, it's okay. Hey, stay with me. Look at me. It's not that bad. They're patching you up. Then we'll put you on the boat. You'll be home soon. Ok? Hey! Then I'll come and visit you. Right? I'll bring the boys with me. Werner? Johan. - Mr. Snijders. - Good to see you. Likewise. How are you? Good. Yes. It feels good to be back. Can I offer you some ginger biscuits? You probably missed that, didn't you? Thank you. I came to tell you I'm ready to get back to work. That will be difficult. There are no vacancies. I'm afraid there won't be for a while. Times are tough, still. I'm not here for a vacancy. We've been told all volunteers will get their job back, once back home. You received a letter from the ministry. That may be, but our prime minister doesn't pay my rent. We haven't all been off on vacation. We've been working very hard to build this up again. What do you want me to do? Fire someone who has worked here for a couple of years? Who maintains an entire family of this salary? Today, we are saying our final goodbyes to a dear friend. Someone we've only known for a short time. We've shared laughter and tears with him. Werner wasn't only an exemplary soldier, he also served as someone who lifted everyone's spirits. We can take comfort in the fact, that we know Werner is in a good place now. That is for certain. God loves those who have the courage to give their lives to help others. For those people, he has a special place... Close to him. A place... Where Werner will be, from time to time, lifting everyone's spirits. Look at those fucking monkeys. They'd just as easily fight against us when it comes down to it. Who? Those brown monkeys over there. Those boys can't be trusted. They all look too much alike. Do you know they say the same thing about us? Here. - To Werner. - To Werner. Well, your majesty. This one's for you. A brave guy was buried today. He was to this monkey country by your fine words. I won't mention his name because you'll never hear it. Why not? Because you're in your palace... Eating cake with gold cutlery. That's why. Joining us to acknowledge my friend at his funeral... Would be too much trouble. Ok, thank you, mattias. It's like when the Germans came in the night, to take my father and my brother. Where were you then? - Eating cake! - Hey, asshole. Take back what you said about her majesty. - You worry about your own queen? - She is my queen. You can suck my dick with your brown monkey face. Stop! Damn it! Stop! Hey, where are you going? Hey, where is my money? Hey, sir, gita is still busy. This one is taken. Fuck off. De vries... It says here that you and killed soldier de val were responsible for the bren. That's right, sir. I was carrying the ammo. Where's the bren now? The bren fell into the river when soldier de val was hit, sir. What have you been taught about leaving weapons behind during confrontations? A soldier is always responsible for his weapon... He's not allowed to leave it behind during contact with the enemy, sir. You know what the rebels are doing with that bren? They are hiding with it in the bushes by the road. Waiting for one of your friends to pass by. Permission to look for the weapon in the river and scout the... Denied. I'm not about to lose more soldiers. Jakarta wants an investigation into this mess. So, expect to hear more about this. Now get out. Listen, buddy. If you get me in trouble again, I'll cut your throat while you sleep. And trust me, nobody cares about a dead traitor. What are you talking about? You thought nobody knew? Someone from your town had things to say about you and your collaborator Nazi dad. Gentlemen! Everything ok? Yes, sir. De vries was dizzy from the heat. I was just helping him up. - Are you sleeping ok? - Yes, alright. Are you eating well? You know you... How does it work with other people's sins? What do you mean? The sins of someone you love, for example. If you don't recognize them as sins until later, do they become your sins? I don't know the specifics of this case, but I would say no. And the other way around? By doing good, can you ensure someone else's sins are forgiven? They've got him! They've got him! Who? The bastard who shot Werner was caught with a Dutch bren. The next bullet is for anyone who dares to touch this jungle bunny again. - Johan. - Yes. That motherfucker will get what's coming to him. He's tough, though. It doesn't matter. Sooner or later they all break. I'm not so sure. Have you seen how skinny and small that guy is? What are we supposed to do? Just shoot them all to bits? I'm going to bed. Me too. - Do you have a garage out here? - Yes. Do me a favor, get me a battery, starter cables and some wire, will you? Put it there. Just sit down. You know how this works? No. Put the cable ends on the battery when I give the sign. Got it? Are you still with us? Because the part that's really going to hurt is about to start. So, if you would like to say something, this is your chance. The soldier you killed by the river last month was his friend. Do you realize what he and his friends will do to you, if I let them run riot? Save yourself and answer my questions. Where are your companions? Freedom. Freedom for Indonesia! Broken leg. That horse won't make it. - It's his back leg. - Easy. Calm down. Easy. Calm down. Stop there, mister. Stop. Raise your hands! - Are you lost? - No, sir. I want you to listen to me. I have important information about a rebel gang from semarang. Keizer, search him. What do you know that we don't? I know where they are. I can show you where they are, but please let my daughters... He must talk slower, I don't understand a word. - The gaga hitam are hiding... - The gagak what? The gaga hitam is a gang in semarang, sir. They're hiding in his house. They've taken his two daughters hostage. - He wants our help. - In which village is his house? Show us on the map where your house is. - From this spot, we head up here. - That's not going to happen. - Why not, sir? - Because I say so. - This a great opportunity... - It's not a opportunity. The coordinates are too far inside enemy territory. I can't send my men in there. I'd like permission to scout out the terrain, sir. I want this man gone in less than five minutes, or I'll kick you out as well. Be outside the camp at the river in two hours, ok? Ok. Keizer, send him home. Raymond! It's for you. What's the name of the man you're talking about? Bahkan - are you sure? - Absolutely, sir. These people are terrible. That's why I came to the Dutch for help. How many are there? Seven, eight people maybe. Draw the roads leading to your village and where the houses are. You are brave. - Thank you. - You are welcome. What about you? Are you here to help people? Or just to walk in circles like the rest? - The former. - Then be here exactly at midnight. No weapons. Come to the back door and make sure nobody sees you. Alright? Ok. Thank you very much. De vries. One letter. You got a girl, you dirty bastard? And you didn't even tell your best buddies. Sender: Johan de vries. Did you send yourself a letter, you sad bastard? Johan de vries senior. Penitentiary facility vught. I thought your father was dead. He is. - Johan. - Samud. Put this on. It's a two-and-a-half-hour walk to the village. Samuel will guide us inland so we can avoid the main roads. If we're seen, we'll have a lot of explaining to do. Buddy. - Are you ready? - Ready. Wait here. - Who are you? - Quiet! Quiet! - What do you want? - We want to help. Is that camouflage powder? Your first kill is important. It defines who you are. There are only two kinds of people: Hunters and prey. If the enemy is on your doorstep, do you hide? Or do you go outside with a kitchen knife? War forces people to choose, that's a good thing. A souvenir. I've told the guys here a lot about you. That you're doing good things in the east. You are a man now. - Do you have a girlfriend? - I'm not here for you. Or for myself. I'm here for mother. What is it with your mother? She's dead. For three days already. Someone had to tell you. Sorry, I... De vries, Cohen... get up. Report to hut 2 in five minutes. I've been ordered to give you this job. You must've been kissing someone's ass. - Sorry but... - Shut up! Put the prisoner in a Jeep and drop him off in his territory. We're letting him go? There are certain agreements about this. Apparently, he talked himself out of prison. Do you think it was the turk? Or maybe it was mulder? I don't know. What? I don't know. Two types of people. There are only two types of people. Get out. Get out, now! No, leave it. It looks better that way. I'm going to count to five and I want you to be gone. Do you understand? One... Two... Run, run! Three... I heard you had some trouble. You lost a bren gun in the river? That's right, sir. I read the report, your commander is an idiot. You should have returned and burnt the entire area to the ground. I know the guy leading that investigation, he won't bother you again. Thank you, sir. - May I speak freely, sir? - Certainly. Why did you let that prisoner go? Weren't you sure it was him who fired at us? Oh, yes. I was sure. That's why I didn't let him go. I gave him to you. Stay there. Those guys were rebels, weren't they? That's right. And that's not a problem? If you know who you're dealing with. They're a religious group. They want to drive the rebels and communists out. In exchange for money, they'll tell us where to find them. So, what if they get into power? Then we'll talk to whoever wants them out. Chaos rules in this country right now. The japs are out, the English too. The Dutch government doesn't know what to do, and the Indonesians are fighting amongst themselves. The muslims with the christians, the Chinese with the javanese, the communists with the capitalists, and so on. But the average guy doesn't care about that. He just wants to grow his rice. And that's why I'm here. To track down those elements disturbing the peace. So a new country can be built out of all this misery. What that country will look like, or who ends up running it, isn't up to me. What I do know is that the people longing for peace... Will benefit. - Do you know what they call me here? - Who? The locals. They call me ratu adil. Do you know what that means? The rightful ruler. According to an ancient myth, he's a warrior from the middle east who frees the people from their oppressors. Johan, everything you're going to see in the coming days is top secret. - I hope you realize that. - Of course, sir. If you talk to anyone about this, I will arrest you for treason and execute you on the spot. Gita. Gita, right? Wait. I have something that you might like. What do you want? Seriously. Give me one minute. Just have a look. If you don't want it, I'll be gone. It's in the back of my car. I don't need anything. Go away. Wait, gita. We confiscated this from some Japanese. It's not really good camouflage material. In thejungle. I thought maybe you could use it. Maybe make a nice dress or something. - Are you working tomorrow? - Yeah. Can I ask... How much do you make on an average night? Fifteen guilders on a good night. If you want to work tomorrow, that's up to you. But this is enough for you and your child. For a week. What do you want from me? Nothing. Is business good, Charlie? Oh, this is nothing. I took it from a dead rebel. Probably not even real gold. Looks real to me. Hey, we're going into town tonight. I have a bottle of gin with your name on it. Sorry boys. I have to get up early. But don't let me stop you. You missed the last three times. You know that, right? Maybe it's time you set us up with one of those special jobs. Long time no see, de vries. What do you do all day, working for the turk? Nothing. I just chauffeur him around. You can get far in the army by kissing the right asses. We knew that already. Shut your fucking mouth, coolen. If anyone kisses ass, it's you. You fucking asshole. We'll see how far he gets when they find out who he really is. What are you talking about, moron? Oh, didn't you know? Your buddy here is known all over his town... Calm down. What's going on? How do I look? - Good evening. - Good evening. Could we have a scotch and a water, please. So... Have we won yet, boys? Not yet. But it's looking good. It sure does. Come. Maybe you've heard, maybe not. Captain scheepens and his men were ambushed last week. Five out of 19 soldiers were killed, another five injured. Scheepens himself is severely injured. I've heard something about that. Then maybe you've also heard... That scheepens was to head a new commando unit. The special troops corps. It hasn't escaped me, major. I want you to step in. Losing five men in the first week. I'd say, that doesn't sound good at all. Thank you. I've seen your file. You've been waiting for action since '41. Listen, this won't be some third-rate division... That we put on as a show of strength. This is the real deal. On the ground, head to head with the enemy. With this unit, we can fight terrorism. The special troops corps will be the face of our victory. I thank you for your offer, but I'm happy where I am. Raymond, this conflict is almost over. And I want you to win it for us. Almost over? You just told me that scheepens and his team have been shot to pieces. Do you see what's happening in the streets, in the villages? Or do you only see what's happening in this garden? The republic is a reality, there's nothing we can do about that. All we can do is protect our seat at the table... When this new nation takes shape. And to do that, we must restore order... And root out terrorism, so people know they can trust us. So, tell me how we beat this terror. You know the thing about terror? You can't beat it. You have to break it. Destroy it. And the only way to destroy terror is with more terror. Like weeds, you must pull them from the ground by their roots. And when everything's gone, you burn the soil and put the fire out by pissing on it. Especially here in the jungle. Our soldiers don't understand the rules of the jungle. I guarantee you have complete freedom as to how you handle this. - Complete freedom? - Carte blanche. Who covers me when something goes wrong? People who have no one above them. One man, to be precise. The only one above him is underneath him in bed every night. What will you do after this? When this is over, and there is peace. You know what it is? It's not in man's nature to be at peace. That would mean that people are content with what they have. And they never are. What if it did happen and there was peace everywhere. Then what? If people like me weren't needed anymore to bring peace, I would make music. - Music? - Yes. I'd sing opera to the people. Verdi, puccini. The great tragedies. Love, betrayal and war. That's the thing, isn't it? In times of war, people want peace, and in times of peace, people want war. Think about that. Come in. At ease. There was something in the mail this morning that might interest you. I'm proud of you. Congratulations, corporal de vries. On to the business at hand. I've noticed that a Dutch soldier is selling diesel to the rebels. Confidential you know what to do. Where are we going? Wait here. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Doesn't it ever feel strange, fighting your own people? These are not my people. The island I'm from is as far away from here as Amsterdam from Istanbul. It was your people who made it one country. Plus, like you, I'm a Christian. People here really don't like christians. They'll come after us when you're gone. Do you know who that was? Yes. Get all your affairs on java in order tomorrow. We leave here tomorrow at dusk. I don't know when we'll be back. Understood? Gita? Gita! I didn't know you were coming. Let me get changed and we can go. Ok? I am thirsty. I don't have much to offer you. How about some tea? Sounds good. - Haven't you been outside yet? - I have. But I was tired and came in to lie down. Why, Johan? Do you have a cigarette for me? The cigarettes are still in my car. Don't... d'ont forgive us. Are you trying to trap me? Put your hands up! Who are you? Don't look at her! What's your name? Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot us. Who is this? My fiancé. I'll do anything you want. But please don't shoot us. Don't shoot us. Please, Johan? Everyone is saying that it's not a drill this time. - Do you know something? - It'll be fine. Brothers. Do you know what this is? In this file is the order to leave for celebes right away... And cleanse the southern part of the island from every... And that really does mean from every terrorist element. But... This will not be a pleasure trip. If you don't want to be up to your ankles in blood tomorrow, you can bow out now. I suggest the rest of you get on board. We'll make our camp here tonight. Early to bed, ready to leave at 400 hours. Four guards outside, one on the roof. Change guards every two hours. Werner would've loved this. Are you scared? No. You? I'm glad we're finally doing something. Hey! Wake up, all of you! - Getup! - Johan? Everyone, right? Get out, get out! Hey, get out! Move! Hurry up, go! Quiet! Quiet! Shut up! Damn it! Good morning, good people from lisoe. Today is your lucky day. I've been sent here by our queen to stand by you in your hour of need. It has come to my attention that this community... Has been suffering severely from some negative elements. Through terrorist actions... Quiet! Through terrorist actions, these elements are trying to stop your community from becoming prosperous. But fear not. I have come here today to free you from these terrorists. I have here a list of 15 names. When I call your name, please step forward. Puang side. Hurry up! Move it! Move it! Are you puang side? Yes, sir. Andi patta! Hurry! Are you Andi patta? Quiet! Abdullah rashid? Something wrong? You all lost it, didn't you? The captain needs his rest. Come in. De vries. How are you? Permission to speak freely, sir? Go ahead. Today, de vries. I don't know, sir. It bothers me that we don't try these people or even question them. How can we be sure that these are the people responsible? It's a question of having the right information. - What if our information is wrong? - Impossible. But you can't say for sure that everything is 100% right. The thing is... If the information is wrong, it'd still be right, because I say so. This is our mission, Johan. It's the only way to stop the terror here. So, if you have a better way of doing this, I suggest you tell me now. Otherwise I advise you to find your mat and get some sleep. We're far from finished here. Two kinds of people, Johan. If you know which you want to be, you know this is the only way. Who are you really? Hey, hey! Move it! Keep it moving! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Harun lakajang. Move it! Move it! Are you harun lakajang? Yes. Quiet! Shut up! The next names are brothers. So, I want them to come forward together... And take responsibility for their actions. Bachrong siajang, sulaiman siajang kamba siajang, Yusuf siajang I need two volunteers. Johan? Are you the four brothers? The sons of puan siajang. Sons of the convicted criminal? My father is no criminal! The only crimi... A simple yes or no will do. Yes. Fire! Ahmad muttalib. Sorry. It's been a long day. Good work today. When I was 15, my father was diagnosed with cancer in his foot. The doctor gave him four months to live. That same afternoon, he had his whole leg amputated. He's still alive today. Do you see my point? Good luck tonight. De vries. Are you ok? We leave in 90 minutes, so try to get some sleep. Kanna harusan. Hurry! Move it! Is this your name? Kaco numang! - Quick. - It's not me. - Not me. - Just go, quickly. Stay there! - Not me. - Stand still! It's not me. He set me up. What do you mean, "set you up"? He's scheming to take my land. He just set me up. What happened? It wasn't me. Can I get to the bottom of this, sir? Go ahead. Samuel! What's the other man saying? You bastard, is that true or not? It is not me but him. He's got nothing to do with it. What's this man's name? - What's your name? - Pua Palau. - Say it again, clearly. - Pua Palau. Pua Palau. That name is not on my list, so it's not relevant today. With all due respect, sir. Can't we get to the bottom of this? I don't trust this at all. You have three seconds to step aside, or I'll shoot right through you. We've decided to tie you up, as it wasn't clear what you were trying to do this morning. Were you delirious? Or was this meant to be a serious attempt at insubordination? No to both, sir. Whatever is happening here, is not what I signed up for. You know the thing about you, Johan? When I read your file for the first time, I thought: "What shall I do? Shall I give this boy a chance to prove himself, to save the honor of his family? Or will I hold it against him that his father was... One of the highest-ranking members of the Dutch Nazi party nsb?" The son of the man who hounded over 1,000 members of the resistance and Jews to their graves. That son now betrays his own captain. After all I did for you. Betrayal must run in your family's blood. I accepted you in a band of brothers. It pains me to see you turning against us. But, you know what? I don't just want to show my bad side. As soldier de vries thinks he knows better, he will get the chance to prove it. Exactly five miles from here, there's a ship that stays close to support us in case of emergencies. I'll give you a 15-minute head start... Before coming after you with three men. If we find you before you reach the ship, you're mine. Get to the ship and you're safe. Untie him and give him his knife. De vries, you've wasted 30 seconds already. Are you going to make is so easy for us? There are no more tracks from here. You think he went on through the water? He must have. Let's walk further. I think we lost him. I wanted that little Nazi rat so badly. Let's go back. Give me two minutes. Careful now. Throw your gun on the ground. Come on. - Take your shirt off. - What? Shirt off! Tell me where the captain is. I don't know. Don't lie to me. You know where he is. I lost him half an hour ago. I couldn't keep up with him. - Maybe he didn't want me to. - Look in front of you! Believe me. You know I wouldn't hurt you. Then why is the gun's safety off? I'm impressed, Johan. It's a shame it had to come to this. Such a shame. You're the only one I'd give this chance to. You know that. I know. I just don't know why. Because we could've gone far together. You must stay focused. I could've had you then. What are you going to do, Johan? Shoot your friend and mentor on a beach? Or are you going to make a run for it? You know I'm a good shot. Maybe I'll do neither. Stop whining, soldier. It's only a flesh wound. Keep pressure on it and you'll make it. I expected to see you much sooner. Me too. Did you watch? What? What do you think? Some of it. What did you think? I think you're better at being a soldier. But... Did you only come here to tell me that? So, get on with it then. I have autographs to sign. Stop whining. It's only a flesh wound.
