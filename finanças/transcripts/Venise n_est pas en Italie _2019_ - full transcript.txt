You love to contradict me. -And you, you love bother this poor boy. Sigh Pauline, my pin! I not bother, right? And you live where? Impasse Marronniers. Impasse... Marronniers. This is where the Roma are? -No. Well... not really. There's just a trailer. My house is the one next door. And call me at home one day? Dad, you help me with my dress? If there is a caravan, it's probably not without the Roma. Dad! Come please. It inspires. -It's terrible. To say that people live like that again... Coming, honey! A woman speaks Italian.

It is our pleasure to meet you. Emile us a lot about you. -Is that so? Ah yes! -Hm... I can not say the same for you. You are his cousins? Non. No, we're not cousins. We're his parents. His parents? -Yes. Oh, sorry! That is true. Sorry... You were not with him this afternoon? Yes, but it disappeared. I knew he was sleeping in Fusina, I spoke to the concierge and he took me by boat. As it is the only camp I asked "Chamodot". I should have chosen a bitch: she would not have found me. She came so far, can not you see what that means? You, you see that this is the end of the world? If you went to the dance camp? Emile will join us. OK. What are you doing? Tell me she's hot... And did you see the face I have! You do not care. Come. Health. You were in the shower? Well yes! They are huge, your parents. Your father, I too gets off. I would love having a family like yours. -What? Oh no... I assure you not. But if! Your father and mother seem to love so much. Why you're gone all the time? Because of my father? No, it was nothing... Do not worry. You dance? Leave me alone. What are you doing? -And you, what are you doing here? Let's go. Let's go! Good evening. Good evening. -I am the father of Emile. Your daughter runs no danger at this campsite. Relax. Enjoy, it's a great DJ. Thanks, but this is not the time. Let's go. As our children attend, we will meet again. They will not be attending long. Well, good evening. Stop, you're hurting me! -Advance. Hey, Emile... Why you told Pauline that we were cousins? You're ashamed of us? We not suit you as parents? It's not me who agree as a child. What? -Otherwise, you teindriez not my hair. And yes... Yes, I am ashamed! I am ashamed to live in a caravan, to look like a fake bleached blonde, to not have a laptop. I am ashamed that one is not a normal family. But it is no normal people. You have to understand that! People just under freaks you, it exists! Never repeat. -Another! What are you waiting for? In your books, you hit his kids, right? Warning. If I put in another... -Knock yourself out! I can not anymore! -Bernard! Let's go to bed. That's what I'm doing your shit lotions. I can not take over this crap. Me repetitions I was never more beautiful like that! Never again! It's understood? Never again! Health. You want to eat something? Do not worry, I'm small-dej. You leave with us? No, I'll stay a while. They were looking for a waitress here. And the boss wants to take me for testing. I start tomorrow. Cool. -Yes, I'm happy. I'm happy and sad at once. It makes me all the time. Good luck to all. -Thank you. Natacha. To leave is to die a little. And to die is far from. Take care of yourself, Natasha. -Thank you. Oh, my little cat! She laughs. Take care of yourself. -Ciao. Why do not you stay? I crossed without warning the restaurant. If I not return, I will work more in the kitchen. Already my boss will get high... You know what? We will go together to see your leader. Are you serious? -I've never been more serious. You'll hit you 300 km more to take me to a restaurant? 300 km longer, 300 km less, to the point where we are, what's the difference? Vijay left a message with a comment. Look! Ah! I like him, this Indian. Come on, kids! You think it's time? But there is no right or wrong time. If you wait for the right time, it will never happen. They sing loudly. Congratulations, Mom! Come on, kids! After me. Bravo! This morning, it was September. No new Pauline all holidays. When I tried to call his father won. And she's not on social networks either. Dude, are you? It's okay. It was good, your vacation? -It went. I'm fucking nothing. As usual'! -Yeah. Excuse me... Attention.
