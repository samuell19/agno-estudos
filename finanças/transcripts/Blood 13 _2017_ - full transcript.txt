Multicom Jingle [drums and trumpets playing] [Exterior Street Noise] [Tense Music] [gags] Mei. Stop gagging. Go wait outside. No way. I promised the head of the academy that I would look after you. Look after me? You? Save it. Move, move! We’re working here. Don’t come in here. Seriously. Stop undermining me. [gagging] [Zhou]This is the color of skin when the blood is drained. Who are you? Who let you in? You are detective Xing? Yes. This is my referral letter. You’re at the wrong place. I’m no longer in charge of that case. Why? It’s disturbing. Mei. Mei. Where the hell are you? Did you really leave? [man] Welcome! Allow me to introduce you. This is senior detective Zhou Minsheng. The precinct has assigned him to help us investigate last year’s prostitute murder case. I’m no expert. Wait, what? I told you I’m not taking that case. Have I approved that? Who are you to choose cases? You have to take the case. That’s right, you brat. You are so arrogant. The precinct is transferring you to another department. Don’t come back. All right. Let’s continue our meeting. Case 1-5, victim Cheng Xiao. Lead waitress at Liangxin Restaurant. All right. I have to take this case, right? It was my case. I was responsible. It’s all my fault. If I didn’t ask my sister for the money... What kind of cram school costs 50K? Mobile app development. I thought you were a fine arts major. Why do you study APP now? It’s not me. It’s my boyfriend Liu Yang. Look at that shadow. You scared me. -What shadow? -Look, look. There’s a man staring in that direction. You were saying last night you were at the dorm, your boyfriend never showed up, and you ended up not going to your sister’s. I couldn’t reach Yang. I thought he was stopping by, so I stayed in. And I didn’t call my sister. When was the last time you talked to him? I don’t know where he is. It’s been a few days. He disappeared. [Min] Surveillance camera shows, on the night of the murder, there were four suspects near Cheng Xiao’s apartment. Taxi driver, Ke Zhenghua, male, 40 years old, drove Cheng Xiao home at 10:13 p.m. He left immediately. There was a man accompanying her-- Body type: overweight. Height: 175cm. He walked out of the building at 10:45 p.m., deliberately avoiding the surveillance camera. The third suspect is a man wearing a black shirt. He looks relatively small. He arrives at 11:00 p.m. There’s no image showing when he left the building. The fourth suspect-- according to the victim’s sister, Cheng Yao, this man is Cheng Yao’s boyfriend. Liu Yang, 23 years old. He entered the building at midnight. Left at around 1:00 a.m. He left in panic. Cheng Yao and Liu Yang planned to pick up the 50,000 yuan from the victim, but Liu Yang didn’t show up. Instead, he showed up alone in the middle of the night. We have reason to believe that Liu Yang-- Captain! Captain! There’s a bloody man here to confess. Who are you, Batman? You watch too many movies. Batman is here to confess... The sun has set, Batman. [whimpering] Liu Yang, we have a policy here. We respect anyone who confesses. Since you are here, tell us your side of the story. If you cooperate with us, we will be lenient towards you. I didn’t kill her. Then why are you here to confess? Blood. Blood. I didn’t kill her! What’s happened to him? Hold him. Hold him down! Did you check the blood on him? I did. Indeed... it’s Cheng Xiao’s blood. Really? Case solved? I didn’t kill her. I didn’t kill her! Hurry up and get the tranquilizer! I didn’t kill her! [screams, gasping] It’s very obvious. It’s manic depressive psychosis. We still need to confirm the cause after some examinations. Is there a medical condition for his symptoms? Of course. It’s known as Renfield’s Syndrome. The sight of blood excites him. Really? Terrifying. All right, you stay here. I will go back to finish the report. You can’t leave me here. I’ll go crazy. Then go crazy. I can stay with him. Feeling better? Let’s have a chat then. I’m afraid. What are you afraid of? You didn’t kill her. You believe me? I didn’t kill her. Trust me! I didn’t kill her. I know, I know. When you got there, she was already dead. Yes. Blood. On the white sheet. There’s a red dress. The color of blood. Once I saw the dress, It turned me on. [gasps] [whimpering] [screams] Stop it. I’m not hungry. You still have to eat something. You haven’t eaten the whole day. You can’t go to sleep without eating. You think we still have time to sleep? No sleep? If I don’t sleep... Are you a human? All you think about is food and sleep. Worry about your own life. Looking after you is my only worry. I promised your father. I’ll make sure you marry a good person. As your dear friend, I... will fulfill this wish. I have you. Why do I need to get married? Hush! Don’t let my girlfriend hear that. Again? You’re quite efficient. Efficient? I’m not that efficient. Lao Zhou. Where’s the captain? You can’t just talk to the boss. We’re here, you can talk to us. I’m not looking for the captain, I’m... [Min] Mister... I told you I’m in charge of this case. The captain is busy. If you have more details, you can tell me. He can’t handle all the details. Cheng Xiao is a prostitute. [Shuo chokes] No way! Did Liu Yang tell you that? Cheng Yao didn’t tell the truth. What? Are you going to avenge her? Sit down. It’s nothing to be proud of. She didn’t want to bring it up. When we solve cases, we have to put ourselves in their shoes. But she withheld important information. It hindered the investigation. When Liu Yang went to Cheng Xiao’s apartment, the door was slightly open. He walked in and saw a red dress. [switch clicks] [flashlight clicks] [grunting] -Lao Zhou-- -Shh. [door creaks] [grunting] [Min coughing] Are you okay? You... You’re leaving? It’s not him. You... Get up! Sorry, sorry, officer. I won’t do it again. Run, aren’t you a good runner? It’s a misunderstanding, sister. Tell us why you ran. I thought I saw ghost. So you knew Cheng Xiao was murdered. Of course I knew. I live right next door. Everyone’s talking about it. Why would you be afraid of a ghost? To be honest, I took some drugs before you brought me in. Everything’s a blur. You appeared out of nowhere. I thought I saw her. How could I not run? So tell me... were you her client? [laughs] We were neighbors, we looked after each other. There’s nothing wrong with that. You have no shame! [Zhou grunting] I’m old now. I’m not as energetic as you young kids. Is this case that important to you? You get capricious with old age. [chuckles] You shouldn’t waste your time anymore. This case has nothing to do with your murderer. Don’t rush to conclusions. See for yourself. He is not the murderer. You can see this case is not about your serial killer either. Was he there for the money? On the night of the murder, he went to Cheng Xiao’s for sex. He entered through a hole in the balcony. He saw Cheng Xiao hide the money in the closet. Cheng Xiao’s restaurant reported 50,000 yuan went missing. The bills were all new, all numbered. That’s right, Mei. Follow me. Where to? To the murder site. Nope. We’ve searched through this place. There’s no money. No way, I saw it with my own eyes. No one else was in the room. Are you sure? It must be him. [knock on door] Who is it? I came back right after I saw her hide the money. I was going to take it as soon as she left. [knocking] Are you stupid? Can you talk? Hey! Sorry, wrong door. Sorry! [scoffs] [doctor] This is a special case. When there’s no blood, he’s perfectly normal, and he’s very smart. Can I talk to him again? [video game sounds] [Zhou] I see you’re doing better without the medication. Look at how normal you look. Then release me. Why am I still here? Are you sure you’re fine now? -It doesn’t matter. -Okay. They will come and take you to the police station. Where? Police station. You haven’t confessed everything. I’ve told you everything. What more do you want? Cheng Xiao wanted to give you 50,000 yuan. Where is the money? Let me explain. Cheng Yao and I were going to take the money, but around 10:00 p.m. Cheng Xiao texted me. thought she wanted to see me. So I went alone. I didn’t know about the money, I didn’t take it. I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. There’s more to it. What more do you want? I’ve told you everything I know. I swear, I’m telling you the truth. You don’t believe in anything. I can’t trust you. How can I make you understand? I’m done! Why can’t you understand? I have a headache. Doctor, I have a headache. -Are you done talking? -I’m done! You’ll have to stay here longer then. Stop! Stop! Wait. If I help you catch the murderer, will you let me go? According to forensic reports, Cheng Xiao’s time of death was around 12:00 a.m. At 5:45 p.m. in the afternoon Li Tianxiao sees Cheng Xiao hiding money in the closet. At 10:13 p.m. in the evening, Ke Zhenghua, the taxi driver, takes Cheng and a man home. At 10:45 p.m. in the evening, an unidentified man leaves. Around 11:00 p.m., a man with a baseball cap knocks on Li’s door. There are only two households in this basement. So we can assume the man in the black suit was looking for Cheng Xiao. Do you think it’s the same man? Yes, I think he is the murderer. Money is the motive. How did he do it? According to the restaurant owner’s statement, we know in order to pay for her sister’s tuition, Cheng Xiao stole money from the restaurant and hid it in her home. Her neighbor, Li Tianxiao, tried to steal it, he didn’t expect an intruder. The man in the black suit was there for the money. He killed her and took the money. I have notified the bank. Once the bills are located, they will notify us. Tell me when did the man wearing the black suit leave? There was an alley in the back of the building without a surveillance camera. There is another escape route. Isn’t it too soon to draw conclusions? Boss, we’ve found the money. Captain, I request permission to arrest. What’s your problem? I’ll sue you! Don’t waste my time. Give me my bag. I have to go home and cook for my husband. You still have to explain where the money came from. That’s our money. My husband’s salary. We worked hard for it. We can prove the money has something to do with a murder case. -Please cooperate. -I need to see a lawyer. I have the right to remain silent. My heart... I’m having a heart attack. Mei, call forensics. He just examined a body with a bottle of medicine in his pocket. Our auntie needs it. I don’t need it. Just call my husband, Gao. General Gao, please, drink some tea. Don’t you know how to knock? Ruthless. Forget it. Let’s figure things out. I still have a meeting to go to. Come back. Meet General Gao from the Finance Department. Good afternoon. This is the girl who arrested my wife? We’re only inquiring... Are you done? Can we go now? I’m afraid not. Are we in some kind of trouble? Big trouble according to Criminal Law. Your wife is involved in a homicide case. If she still refuses to cooperate, we will make her. Homicide? [chuckles] This is a joke! My wife wouldn’t even kill a fish. Case 15, victim, Cheng Xiao, hides 50 grand in her home, but we did not find the money. Coincidentally, your wife showed up at the bank with this money. General, since you are here, I would like you to help us with our investigation. Can you confirm... he was the one in the taxi? Positive. They were in the backseat. It’s obvious what was going on. Great! Thank you. No problem. It’s our obligation to help. May I go now? Yes. Let me know if you need me. No problem. I met her at the restaurant. She seemed sincere and hard working. We became acquainted. Last month she asked to borrow money. I thought a woman would never do that, unless she was desperate, so I lent her the money. That night she told me she wanted to give the money back. I didn’t know she was stealing. It’s hard to trust people. What time did you leave? It was... around 10:30 p.m. I don’t remember. It was before 11:00 p.m. There was an emergency meeting that night. I arrived at 11:00 p.m. I was almost late. Where did you last see her? Where else? Near her restaurant, of course. I told you I hardly knew her. It’s not what you think. What are we thinking? How dare you ask me such a thing? What are you implying? Where’s your captain? Ask him to come here! This is ridiculous! Are you trying to extort me? Do I look like a criminal? I didn’t say you are a criminal. You know what you’ve done! Insolent! How dare you disrespect a national leader! I will sue you for slandering! You will pay for this. Yes, I am responsible for what I say. Every word. Are you okay going home alone? I can send a car for you. I’m okay. I just want to be alone. Don’t dwell on things. Nothing is clear. He... I already knew what was going on. What are you doing here? Are you divorcing my mother? Daughter, it’s not what you think. You... it’s been so many years. It’s the same excuse. [muffled shouting] If we screw up this time, it’ll be over for our team. How did he get in there? Something’s about to happen. I wasn’t expecting it. Cheng Xiao was such a good girl. She returned the 50,000 yuan to me. Did you meet her to get the money? I didn’t know she wanted to return the money. I truly liked her. I knew it was wrong. I wanted to break up with her. That night I went to meet her to say goodbye. I gave her a red dress. Chanel limited edition. You gave her the red dress? Yes, I wanted to-- You wanted her to be wearing it when she died so you could feel better about yourself. No, I could never do such things. This is your phone. "It’s been done." General, can you explain? I texted him. I canceled the trade! This has nothing to do with me. -Nothing! -General Gao, you are charged with hiring a hit man. The man you hired brutally killed Cheng Xiao. Lao Zhou, I respect you because you are my elder, but you have no loyalty to the team. White cat, black cat. Whoever catches the rat is the good cat. Where did you get his phone? His wife gave me. How did you retrieve the text message? Liu Yang, my expert from the hospital. Can you explain why Cheng Xiao hid the money before she returned it to Gao? That information... doesn’t concern me. What do you mean? You-- It’s not my case. I... You... Just be prepare to catch the murderer. I have to go now. You’re leaving? This time... I’m wrong. Girl, you’ve got this. Our target is here. Police! Freeze! What are you doing? Don’t move! What’s wrong with you? Boss, is this the right person? [radio crackles] Here! [woman screams] [woman] Please go through security check. Please go through security check. Where are you going? Please go through security check. I’m going through it. -What’s inside? -You’re breaking the law. -You have no right to go through my things. -Give that to me. You have no right to go through my things. [woman gasps] Take a look. Her blood was indeed drained. The ground is soiled with blood. Water is drained too. Look at her stomach. I can tell she hasn’t eaten in days. Boss, look at her nails. She’s probably a prostitute. Go run a search. How do I do that? Look at her face. It’s all rotten. Chen, you’re new. This is your chance. Do your best. If I had followed up on the case, we would have caught this devil. I can give you a ride. Just take me to the train station. Did you catch the murderer? It’s not him. What? Impossible. Don’t bring it up. I don’t want to talk about it. [cell phone vibrating] Hello? What’s going on? Another red dress. Forensics just confirmed... both bodies were drained of their blood. [phone ringing] He’s not here. He’s at the site. Wrong number. This is not a hotel. [hangs up phone] You’re taking calls now? Everyone’s at the site. Didn’t you leave? Why are you back? I heard Xing Min’s case didn’t close? I don’t want to talk about it. We caught a guy, but he turned out to be a fraud. You can’t trust the Internet. You could end up hiring a hoodlum. Where is he? Locked up. Look. Our experienced detectives would know it right away. It’s not him. Younger people lack experience. But he’s been to the site. Yes, indeed. He’s so dumb he knocked on the wrong door. Li Tianxiao opened the door. He got scared and ran to the roof. He didn’t come down until next morning. When he made it down, he heard about Cheng Xiao’s death. He wanted the money he was promised. So he texted Gao and said he did it. Isn’t it misleading? General Gao is a retard too. If he was smart, he wouldn’t have hire a hitman from online. Lao Zhou, are you... Maybe... You’re going to be glad that I’m here. Did you see the guy we caught? Yes. It’s not him. Lao Zhou, I shouldn’t be asking this... 15 years ago... You want to ask about my mistakes? Min didn’t mean it that way. She just wants to know. The precinct has lots of resources. How come the murderer still fled? It was my fault. The female corpse we found was rotted. There were not enough leads. I had a couple of important cases about to close. I didn’t take it seriously. I put an intern on it. I never knew, but a week later, in a destroyed building, another corpse with the same traits was found. The victim was a dancer from the city. She occasionally sold her body. [man sobbing] I’ve never forgotten the look on her father’s face when he went to identify the body. The precinct made the decided to combine these cases. I came back to find the intern. He told me there was a witness, a villager who found the body. I went to the village to meet him. But instead, I witnessed his funeral. He had drowned in the pond the day before. It’s fate. I let him go once. He’ll keep coming back again and again. If I would have treated these people as normal victims, instead of giving up on the investigation, when I realized what their occupation was, I could have saved them. Those women sell their bodies, and ruin other’s families. You’re not wrong. Neither am I. If you think that way, you won’t solve the case. Think like what? I don’t need you to tell me what to think. Lao Zhou, you don’t know Min. We’re talking about human lives. You young people can’t be impulsive. You know what your problem is? Your problem is that you never treat them like real people. You think they deserve to die. Lao Zhou, you can’t-- Don’t argue with him. He’s the expert. We’re not like him. It’s not like we can go around choosing cases as we please. I’ll say it once more. I’m not an expert. I’m just an old cop who is spending his life making up for his mistakes! Doesn’t that sound nice? Making up for your mistakes? Let me tell you. In my opinion, you are wasting your time and your life. Then that is my karma! You know what, Xing Min? With that mindset, you may as well be the murderer. You’re behaving like the murderer. You might as well kill! [Min] We’ve sent a memorandum. We need help with the investigation. We’ve also contacted the Missing Persons Department. Since the case I took a month ago is being brought up, I’d like to disclose more information. Victim, Guo Lili-- found dead at the park, near Foreign Language University, her blood was drained. A red dress was found at the scene. According to her classmate, Guo Lili’s family was poor. She took a few jobs after school. She dropped out of school and was often seen in erotic bars. After those places were closed down, she disappeared. Although we can’t identify these two new victims, it’s the same traits, blood was drained, red dress, black stockings, and the knots, we can see these three cases are similar to the prostitute case from 15 years ago. We can confirm it’s the serial killer from 15 years ago. He is in our city. This is the first victim from 15 years ago. We still can’t confirm her identity. I’ve carried her remains everywhere I go. Maybe it’s fate. The devil has shown up here again. I’m retiring next month. I hope this case that’s been with me for 15 years comes to a close before I retire. Everyone, I’m entrusting you with this case. ZHEN ZHEN FOOT MASSAGE [chattering] Brother, I’m not kidding. These young girls look for jobs online now. They go to bars and clubs looking for work. They don’t really come here anymore. Last month I hired a couple of young girls. They didn’t take the job seriously. They worked here for a while. One day they got in a taxi and never came back. I don’t remember their names. They never showed up after? Not at all. They never gave me my portion of the money. There are rules in our industry. I’m supposed to get a portion of the money. It’s so ridiculous. Are these the two girls? Maybe. That’s her! Her looks were all right, but she was a sweet talker. When was the last time you saw them? Beginning of autumn, I told her to put on a jacket. The weather was cold. She wore an off-the-shoulder red dress. She cared about money more than her life. So she came here first and then left? That’s right. She was here first, then got in a cab and left. [car horns honking] Boss, all the rooms are full. Where should we put him? Is he the one? Yes, he drove Cheng Xiao home. [Zhou] You are Mr. Ke Zhenghua. -They brought you here, too. -It’s fine. It’s my obligation to cooperate with the police. Yes. Officer. I have a favor to ask. Of course, please. It looks like I’m going to be here for a while. I have a sick person to care for at home. [Zhou] A sick person at home? [Ke] It’s nothing serious, but with this weather, I’m afraid it’ll rain and I left my windows open. [Zhou] How about you go home now, close your windows and come back? I can’t do that. There’s a lot of people waiting to be questioned. I don’t want to cause an inconvenience. Maybe... can you find an officer to go in my place? [mutters, stammers] I can go. Thank you very much. Sorry, I know it’s an inconvenience. Just help me close the windows. Don’t worry about the other stuff. Thank you. Okay. Problem solved. Which room? [thunder rumbles] [gasps] [cell phone vibrating] -Hello. - The captain says to take your team to the west side immediately. There may be clues at a massage parlor. They’re almost there. Okay. Ma’am. If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave now. [men chattering on radio] [man] Terminal three. Someone’s calling for a taxi at the airport. I don’t want to answer. I went last night, and only got 200 yuan. [radio host] Our station would like to w arn young fe males to not go out alone at night. What’s there to warn them about? Those who go out at night are all whores! [whistling] [woman screams] [man] Stay still. Sit. [grunts] Lao Zhou, what are you doing? Nothing. Helping you organize the files. Damn. I used to take care of one... Now I take care of two. You don’t need to take care of us. You have a job to do. What job? They’ve got everybody here. We can only organize files here. What? They’re all here? Those taxi drivers are here, they are cooperating, not being interrogated. Without evidence, they are wasting their time. Useless bastards! Why are you arresting me? Do you have proof? Show me. We are not arresting you. We need you to cooperate. I can cooperate... or not, right? It’s your duty as a law abiding citizen to cooperate with the police. Read me my rights. I know my rights. Explain! Where did you park your car? On the roadside. And then? I put my arm around a beauty. What beauty? The fairy under the umbrella. What on earth are you talking about? What fairy? Tell me! Who were you with? I’ll take this one. What? You’re not in charge-- You know why we brought you here? Yes. To cooperate. I’ve been here twice. You can ask me anything. -You used to live elsewhere? -Yes. After middle school, I became a long-haul truck driver in my hometown. Why did you move here? [mutters] I’ve been with my wife for over ten years. She’s had a hard life. I want her to rest where she was born. That’s not illegal, right? You drive every night, and you always go to those streets. Can you explain? There’s something you don’t know. I make more money driving at night. Those areas are busy at night. I need to make money for my sick wife. Is that okay? Of course. Then let’s change the topic. -[speaks Chinese] -Your wife has been sick. Over the years, how do you deal with your physical needs? [chuckles] That question is a little personal. You drive prostitutes at night to satisfy your desires. Those are harsh words. You have sex with them, then you kill them. [chuckles softly] Detective Xing, they’re whores, right? How dirty! If you were me, would you want anything to do with them? -[door opens] -Detective. What are you doing? What’s going on? I’m sorry, Mr. Ke. She’s not in charge of this case anymore. Please take a break. You’ll be speaking to someone else. But we still need your help on the investigation. But when are you-- When are you going to finish? You rushed me here. I didn’t have a chance to give my wife her medication. It’s been a few hours. I have to go help her. I didn’t know you had a sick person at home. Don’t be so quick to judge, Xing Min. Go help him. I’m not going. Mr. Ke, if it’s okay, I can go with Xing Min. You two can go together. Mr. Ke, please stay a little longer. No problem. I will. Thanks, you two. What does she need? We’ll help. Nothing special. There are nutrition bags in the refrigerator. Just refill the bag. No problem. Also, Detective Xing, it’s kind of embarrassing, but my wife is on her period. Can you change her pad? It’s probably soiled with pee and blood. I’m concerned she’ll catch an infection. [door opens] Look. This is a kind of clay. Where is it from? I’m not surprised. When I was little, in art class, we would dig this up in the yard. It’s so clean. Even in the refrigerator. [mutters] -Is this the nutrition bag? -Yes. I think she’s uncomfortable. Let me clean her up first. Her eyes are closed today. Last time I was here, they were wide open. Quite scary. Lao Zhou, could you excuse us? Okay, okay. I’m thinking maybe I was wrong about Ke Zhenghua. He’s prejudiced towards prostitutes. That doesn’t mean he’s the murderer. He’s a good caretaker, he cares for a paralyzed woman. He keeps everything so clean for her. It’s not easy. [phone beeps] Hello? We’ll be right there. What happened? A new corpse was found behind the disposal yard. Boss. Forensics mentioned this time it was quick. Arterial spray from the neck arteries. Time of death was less than four hours ago. That means it wasn’t earlier than 7:00 a.m.? Yes. Where is Ke Zhenghua? Still at the station. After you left, I didn’t take my eyes off him. He couldn’t possibly have done this. This rolling gate is automatic. It opens at 7:00 a.m., closes at 6:00 p.m. The garbage trucks pick up the trash around 10:30 a.m. They pick up from here around 11:00 a.m. So no one found her until the first truck arrived. Surveillance? The street is being repaired this week. All power is out. This is apparently where the murder happened. But there’s no sign of a struggle. Lao Zhou, do you think it was him? This time, the blood was not drained, it spurted. Other than the red dress, there are no similarities. And her identity. This girl looks like a prostitute as well. It’s time for your medicine. I have to go to work. Be nice. You can move now. Good. Looks like we have to adjust your medication. Drink this one first. -Good. Good girl. -[whimpering] -Good girl. Open your mouth. -[muffled gagging] I’m resting. Find someone else. A vampire will suck the blood of a woman in the middle of the night. Police. Show me your phone. What about the police? You’re asking me for help. I have the right to refuse. Only because I’m so nice. I see how hard you’re working. You can use it. You don’t have WeChat? [laughs] Sister, who says everyone has to use WeChat? You have an eye for spotting beautiful things. Look at the moon. You are... What are you doing? Give me your phone. Take a photo of the moon and post it. Let’s see how many views the picture gets. You do it. I’ve never used it before. -[mutters] -Officer! Why are you here so late? I figured you’d be home to change your wife’s pad. That’s right. [chuckling] Do you need me? [grunts] Your back tire looks flat. The front of the car is higher. Impossible. I just did the maintenance the other day. Then you must have something in your trunk. Are you accusing me? [chuckles] How can I? Open it. [beeping] [beeping stops] Let me explain. I didn’t steal them. These two rocks have been outside the museum for a few months. [chuckling] Look at you, so nervous. It’s not like you hid a female corpse or something. Don’t scare me. [chuckles] Show me your phone. Okay. My dear, can you act like a lady sometime? [scoffs] Mei, how did you do the analysis? Is it correct? We’re wasting time. My analysis can’t be wrong. It could be something we missed from the start. Maybe we should look at the surveillance footage again. Maybe we’ll find something new. What time is it now? The more time you spend watching those videos, more people will die. All right, stop arguing. Mei, did the forensic experts get back to you? What else can they say? They told me what we already knew. -The knife wound from the corpse at the warehouse? -Yeah. They had questions about the blood vessels. They took a sample and had it analyzed. By the time they finish, there will be more murders. [sighs] Well... are you hungry? Let me get you some food. [sighs] Min... do you know why random cases are hard to solve? Because they are random. You walk down the street, you see someone, you kill them. A few days after, you kill another one. That’s why these victims, no matter their age or height, have no similarities. The fact that they are prostitutes means they live a secretive lifestyle and they move around. They are prostitutes. They disappear and no one reports them missing. He dumps the bodies all over the place. By the time we find them, we have lost valuable time. PROSTITUTES MURDERED IN VARIOUS CITIES This man only has one thing to say. [Ke] I know you find it difficult to sleep at night. Don’t be afraid. It doesn’t hurt. [sighs] Isn’t it better to just sleep? You won’t feel the pain, just sleep now. Let me help you change the pad. [muffled yelling] You’re paralyzed! Where’s all this blood coming from? Blood, blood, blood! Smells so good! Come, come! Eat it while it’s hot... Dead people wore this. It doesn’t bother you? So what? It’s just clothes. Isn’t what we’re doing... a violation? We’re just trying it out. Who knows? What if you really find him? Then we get him. [thunder rumbling] [thunderclap] [line ringing] [line continues ringing] [woman speaking Chinese] [keyboard clacking] Lao Zhou, you are an experienced detective. I expect this from the younger officers, but you should know better. You deliberately ignored protocol. Xing Min was born into a police family. If she was harmed, I would be disappointing the head of the academy. Captain, Xing Min has disappeared. We should hurry and find her. What are you still doing here? I’m emphasizing discipline! -It’s not the right time! -Enough! The water truck driver told me Xing Min got into a taxi. Captain, give me two teams. One will come with me to Ke Zhenghua’s. The other one will follow Mei, check surveillance cameras from all angles, get records of all the taxis that drove by. You got that? Get going! -Mei, I’ve examined the camera footage. -Go! There were only five cars that drove by the bridge at that time. They belong to three taxi companies, only one car has a fake license plate. -Fake license plate? -[keyboard clacking] Go on! Check its driving route. Show me where it came from! [car door opens] Officer, you keep doing this to me. It’s so late now. You’re not sleeping. Not driving. What are you doing? I was just helping my wife. I was about to leave. I felt sleepy, so I took a nap in the car. What’s wrong? What were you doing yesterday between 4:00 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.? What else? I was driving. Where? Yesterday... Yansha Road, Beiwei Road... I don’t remember. I should go inside now. Mind if I come in? It’s so late already. Officer... My wife is sleeping. Are you suffocating her? The air is too polluted. Especially at night. Our home is old, but is made of brick and tile. Very tough. What’s wrong? What about my trunk? [trunk opens] -[beeping] -[Ke mutters] Are you leaving? Take care! [engine starts] [click] -[Shuo] Hello? -Mei, help me check Ke Zhenghua’s driving record. -Okay. -All of it! I got it, Lao Zhou. [phone vibrating] Who is it?! [beeping] It’s offline again. Could this be an error? Heading north. We can only go in that direction now. [sighs] We can’t pass. Let’s go up that way. [gasps] [insects buzzing] We found the owner of the car. It hit the roadside bush in the morning. The driver ran away. According to the surveillance camera footage, the driver was a young man. The captain will bring him to the station. [door bangs open] I’m not a man. I don’t want to go to the site. I’m afraid she’ll laugh at me. [crying] I never had a girlfriend. Min is the only one I love! I’m a weak man. But I love her! [crying continues] [exhales] [sighs] What have I done? Go. I’m sorry, officer. I was really sleepy. I didn’t mean to run. -How come? -I was looking for someone. Who were you looking for? I wanted to run away at first, but I thought to myself, he has to keep his word. I did everything I could to find the car owner. You’re not the owner? I’m not. I found this job online. I drive the night shift. We split our earnings. Who is the owner? I really don’t know. Do you really think we’re that dumb? I really don’t know. We communicated via the Internet. We set a time and place to pick up the car and the money. It’s been a few months. We really haven’t met. Mm. Do you know a Li Chun? -Who? -I’ll tell you who. We found the owner, Li Chun, through the VIN. This car is not a taxi! [breathes heavily] [breathing heavily] [door opens] Mei? Mei... What are you doing? I’ve thought about it. I can’t do this anymore. He’s the devil and I will fight him to the end. Do you know where you’re going? I don’t know. It’s none of your business! You’re all useless. I will find her myself! -Mei! -[man] Mei Shuo! Mei Shuo! Come. Same face, same hairstyle. You can tell she just got a haircut. [grunts] Here’s the key. Xing Min has a birthmark on her back. This girl doesn’t. -How do you know? -Xiao Liu told me. -How does he know? -They went swimming last March. -Are you certain? -I’m almost positive. But I need confirmation from DNA found on on Xing Min’s clothes. Records show that Li Chun disappeared 15 years ago. But the car was bought five years ago. If she’s dead, how did it happen? We have to go to Li Chun’s hometown and backtrack. [sighs] -[man] Please, have some tea. -[Shuo] Thank you. Could you please think? All these years, you never heard about her? She was dating someone from school. I told her to stop. She took all her things and left. I got over it, it’s as if she was never in my life. What was her boyfriend’s name? -Where does he live now? Do you know? -No. Uh, did you look for her? She’s not a part of my life anymore. Why would I look for her? Even if she was, she wouldn’t be of any help. [chuckles] He didn’t mean it that way. We just want to know did you ever meet the boyfriend? I did. She brought him home once. Was it this man? Quiet. Cut it. [muffled whimper] Sister, don’t be afraid. We’re police officers. [stammers weakly] -[muffled whimpering] -Don’t be afraid. [shushing] We need another statement after she wakes up. -[siren blaring] -See if she can remember anything. -Lao Zhou. -Yes? You should take a look. What? [mutters] [grunts] Get a flashlight. What’s that smell? [door closes] [muffled screaming] [coughs] [gasping] [coughing] [monitor beeping] This woman has a strong will. She takes sedatives every day, but her brain is not affected. It’s a miracle she’s still breathing. I forgot to tell you about the corpse at the warehouse. The precinct called. They figured out the knife wound. The knife was stuck in the collarbone for a long time. Blood accumulated in the vessel causing it to rupture. [sighs] If they had given us the test results a day earlier, we wouldn’t have done such a stupid thing. You mean Guan Hong was murdered by Ke Zhenghua as well? Think about it. Why didn’t he take out the dagger right away? To prolong her death. Why would he want to do that? To create an alibi. [sighs] He fooled us. Take a look. The patient wrote this. BOOK HAPPY BIRTHDAY! TO MY DEAREST HUA [Zhou] "Chun grew up without a mother. "Her dad is an alcoholic. "He hits her when he’s drunk. "I grew up with my grandpa. "Maybe that’s why we liked each other in school. "I know I’m the only one she can count on. [bicycle bell dings] "We moved in together. "Because I’m much older than her, "the neighbors would talk about us behind our backs. "But Chun tells me, as long as we love each other, "we shouldn’t care about what people say. "Those were the best days of our lives. "If only we could freeze time. "But Chun is a woman. "Women need to enjoy themselves. "They need to enjoy life. I couldn’t give her what she wanted." [shouting] [door opens, closes] "Then she changed. "She was always out. "She said she could take care of herself. "Take care of herself? "She could only sell her body. "I wanted to save her. I wanted to save those shameless women." Chun looked very pale. She looked so sexy lying there on the black soil. She looked fragile, so I let the blood out. When Chun’s blood drained, her sould was cleansed. You women... You don’t know how pure you are. I bought a red dress for her. It cost me two months’ salary. I wanted her to wear it for our wedding. Why didn’t you put it on her? Her skin was dirty. She couldn’t wear it. Her soul needed to atone. The red dress is meant for an innocent soul. You never stopped killing after that? Who doesn’t want a good life? I wanted to get married. I wanted to have children. But who knows why? I married a girl who couldn’t have children. So she meant nothing to you? When I found out she couldn’t conceive... I lost interest in her. I just couldn’t make love to her anymore. I’m useless. -[panting] Lao Zhou, hurry! -What’s wrong? We found video of Ke passing the toll road station. -[siren wailing] -Give me the key. For a short period of time, I didn’t want to kill anymore. But they don’t listen. They have no shame! I had to kill them. I drained them, cleaned their stomachs, so their souls would be cleansed for atonement. [sirens wailing] The doctor said his wife’s disease was not so serious. She could still move. She could still talk. It looks like she is also a victim. He won’t let his sick wife die. My wife was my best alibi. Even though she’s like a hen that can’t lay an egg, she always gets her period on time. I clean her blood. What about Cheng Xiao? I didn’t mean to kill her. She kept teasing me with that dress. What about Guo Lili? What about Guan Hong? What do you want me to say? I don’t even know their names. What difference does it make? They’re all dirty whores! You’re a monster. Ever since I killed my love, Chun, I’m not a man anymore. How did we meet? That night you stood out in the rain. You looked just like Chun in my dream. You are too beautiful. Damn. We lost them. [sighs] Useless! Lao Zhou, is Min still alive? Yes. She’s waiting for your confession. Get in the car. We’re not waiting for the team? I know where they are. Just come with me. You are like Chun. As beautiful as Chun. [breathing heavily] [grunting] Come. Over here. This is where we found the first body 15 years ago. [Shuo] There’s signs of a struggle. Lao Zhou, this is Min’s watch. Let’s go. I didn’t expect... a woman like you couldn’t arouse me. You are not my Chun. I can’t find my Chun anymore. [siren wailing] Lao Zhou, it’s a cliff. Sit tight. [Ke] Chun’s dirty. She’s dirty. She can’t go back anymore, even if she dies. You’re not Chun. Chun listens to me. She wouldn’t betray me. Of course I’m not Chun Li! Chun died 15 years ago. Lao Zhou has been holding on to her skull. She’s been watching you. Everything you do. But you-- you are a monster. You killed the woman who loved you, and you use it as an excuse to continue killing. You don’t deserve to die! [engine revving] [siren continues wailing] [Shuo] Taxi! Ke Zhenghua! Hurry up! Catch him! [engine revving] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [engine revving] [horn honks] Detective Xing, you are the 13th. That number is bad luck. I won’t take you to the grave with me. Ke Zhenghua, you can’t die like this. You have to confess. You have to apologize to those parents! [grunts] [tires screech] Stop the car! Stop the car! [brakes screech] -[coughing] -Min. Min. Girl, wake up. Girl... -[coughs] -Girl... [explosion] [sighs] [breathing heavily] [birds twittering] Girl... thank you for staying by my side all these years. You gave me the courage. You can rest in peace now. [sniffles]
