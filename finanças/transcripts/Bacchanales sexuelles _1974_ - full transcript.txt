Well? I'm sorry, ma'am, but I've never seen the reporter. He sends us his articles in the mail. I don't know him. We've never seen him around here. Then how do you pay him? You must have an address. Yes, of course... but I'm not supposed to divulge that. But seeing as you're so pretty, perhaps I can find it. Here we are: 34 Passy Square. That's all I know. Thank you very much. Is someone there? Sophie? It's Valerie. I just got here. This place is huge. Listen, could you come over? I'm scared here all by myself. My cousin's in America for a while. Why don't we both stay here? So you'll come? Hurry. Third ﬂoor, on the right. Bye. Hello. Wow, this place is huge! Yeah. Haven't you ever been here before? Just a couple times. It's impressive. But I'm scared to be here all alone. Well, well. So your cousin has you house-sit while he's away? He must really trust you. People seem to trust me. Besides, the cheapskate never gave me a thing. The least he can do is lend me his place for six months. Six months? We're going to stay here for six months? Would you have anything to drink? Make yourself at home. I'll see what I can find. Have you got a towel? Wait. I'll show you. That's good vodka! You're not scared anymore now that I'm here. I'm starting to feel good. - You've put on weight. - What do you mean? Take a good look. I'm still in shape. Go ahead and touch. You like that? I'll show you how much I like it. Wait a minute. Let me close the curtains. Hold on! Are you sure your cousin won't show up? I told you. He's in New York. In America. What does he do? I have no idea. It's hot in here! Wake up! Fred? It's Sophie. I know it's late. Listen, you've got to come over right away. Please! There's something strange going on. You'll come? Great. Let me give you the address. It's 34 Passy Square, third ﬂoor. I think there are burglars in the apartment. Great. See you soon. Sophie? Are you asleep? You tricked me. just you wait. Who are you and what are you doing here? I live here! And just who are you? I thought you were Sophie... at first. So you're a friend of Sophie's. She was sleeping with me in my bed. She must be around here somewhere. Let's make the bed and then we'll look for her. Be good, eh? Let's look around the apartment. Maybe she's hiding. Check under the bed. Under the bed? What do you think you’re doing? What about Sophie? She must have gone out. She'll come back when she feels like it. What do you want? Let me go! Help! Help! Help! What's this little game you're playing? Let me go right now! Where is he? Who? Your cousin, you idiot! My cousin? I don't even have a cousin! You're playing dumb. Let me explain. I am the high priestess of those who worship unsullied ﬂesh. There's a traitor in our midst. I don't know who it is... but he lives on Passy Square, third ﬂoor, on the right. We questioned his concierge. He must have ﬂed to avoid capture... and he entrusted you, his cousin, with his apartment. I'll show you our members. You will point out your cousin sol can confront him at our next ceremony. You've got the wrong person. I don't have a cousin. My name is Sophie. Valerie is my friend. It's not even my apartment. Come now, my little Valerie. Look at the pictures and point him out for me. It's a little hard to tell who's who. Your cousin stole some pictures from me. That's why I must confront him. I'm sure you can point him out for me. But I'm not Valerie. You've got the wrong woman! Very well. I see you insist on lying. Send in Carl and Frida. What are you going to do to me? Let me go! Make her talk. Come with us. - Not a word. - Let me go! Let me go! Hi there. Sophie's not back yet? What do you care about Sophie? You need her for something? Do you need her? Wow, what's this? Let me see. What filth! That's disgusting. Is your cousin blackmailing somebody? I have no idea. I know he's a little odd. - Well? - She didn't say a word. It would seem there's been a mistake. Really? She claims her name is Sophie. His cousin Valerie is still in the apartment. Send Jenny over there. She has to get inside somehow and bring me back a picture of him. I must determine his identity before the ceremony tomorrow. Go now. That dog! Betraying me! I'll find out who he is... and expose him in front of everybody! Madam, look! “L Am A Sorceress“ How dare he! He could be the ruin of us all. I'll have my revenge tomorrow. Get everything ready for tomorrow. You'll be presenting the new initiate. Very well, madam. At your service. Traitor. My little traitor. You feel so cold against my body... as cold as a dead reporter. I'll find out who you are... and have my way with you before killing you! Your cousin is a strange one. He's some kind of special reporter. He investigates strange goings-on and secret societies. Wait, I'm starting to remember. She tried to wake me up but I was drunk. She said someone was in the apartment. So she wasn't lying when she called me. There must have been someone here. Fred, this is awful. I'm sure she's been kidnapped. We have to find her! Hello. - Who are you? - The maid. He's in America. I'm his cousin. He told me to expect you. I'm at your service. Where's the kitchen? I'm just back from vacation, and I don't remember where anything is. End of the hall, on the right. Well, that's that. - Please run a bath for me. - Right away, miss. Look through his papers and see if you spot anything interesting, okay? Your bath is ready, miss. - What is your name? -jenny. Jenny, you're all wet. Take off your uniform. Come join us. And just who are you? I'm the maid. I don't think hiring someone to replace me was very nice. What is this? Which of you is really my cousin's maid? I am! We shall see. What's your name? Katarina. Katarina. Very well. - How old is my cousin? - Thirty-two. Jenny, what does my cousin look like? Does he have a beard or a moustache? Is he hairy or clean-shaven? I can't exactly say. I don't know. So you're trying to steal my job? You bitch! May the best woman win. Now, Jenny, you're going to tell us everything. Where is Sophie? Who sent you here? I can't tell you. I know how to make her talk. Malvina has some incriminating pictures of me. I can't tell you anything else. Wait a minute. If I can get those pictures for you, will you tell me where Malvina lives? Yes. Check that they're all there. Some are missing. No, they're all here. If you'll let me destroy them, I'll give you Malvina's address. Very well. Here's Malvina's address. I'm going now. You'll never hear from me again. Don't let anyone in the apartment while I'm gone. Come on. I'm totally confused. So you're our new initiate. Silence! Speak only if I ask you a question. Paul. I want to see her naked. Let me do it. You're a brute. Very nice. There are just a few small details missing. Come satisfy me. That was worse than ever, Paul. You're useless. You shall be humiliated. If you can't manage to satisfy my body... perhaps you can satisfy my mind. Come. Take her while I watch. That will be my pleasure for today. Don't worry. I know you're not Valerie. You'll be set free tonight. I'm a friend. It's pretty high. Hello. I'm the new girl. I'm to be initiated tonight. Malvina told me to stand here so all the guests... could get a look at me as they arrive. Where is Malvina? I must speak to her. - She's interrogating the prisoner. - Where is the prisoner? The time for the ceremony has arrived. No doubt you've seen all our disciples arrive in their masks. I saw two who weren't wearing masks. What? Not wearing masks? Yes. They asked where the prisoner was. Run to the dungeon and find the intruders. I'll send Carl and Frida as well. Very well. As soon as they're captured, we'll begin the ceremony. Carl! Frida! Valerie! - Did they hurt you? - I knew you'd come to rescue me. We must get out of here. Hurry! Too late. You're trapped. If you help us, I can grant you your freedom. Our freedom? How? What can you possibly do? I know where the photos are. They're in Valerie's apartment. Go get them and bring them back... and we'll destroy them during the ceremony. Malvina will be powerless to do anything. You'll have your freedom. How do we know you really have the pictures? One of you can hold us here as hostages. Valerie, give her your keys. We've got them all. Where's your sister? I've never seen the two of you separated before. She's helping with the preparations. Everything's ready. Let's go. Stand up! Come on, get UP! Why so modest all of a sudden? Leave her alone. She should be clothed to start with. Come on, everybody! Get out of here. No one's allowed in. Let the ceremony begin. This girl will be tonight's victim. But first I will awaken in each of you the desire to arouse in your bodies... the passion that will allow us to indulge our collective desires. Now, brothers and sisters, greet each other and give each other pleasure. Let the festivities begin. You go first. My sister hasn't come back yet. My cousin is in the room. I recognize him. All masks have been removed. Someone here has betrayed us. Point your cousin out to me. What if I refuse? Well? You're free! Look! I have all the negatives! So it's you who betrayed us. Leave me alone with this woman. I am at your mercy. When you were the leader and I was your slave... you never aroused me. But now that you're defeated and desperate... I want you. Where is Fred? What, one's not enough? Hey, everybody's doing it! Let's get out of here!
