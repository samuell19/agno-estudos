- There's still a yard sale. - Please don't. - I don't need... - Maybe there's something good in here, I can already see a table. - Hey. - Hey Meg, careful please. Please don't touch anything. Please don't touch anything. I can touch things. How's it going? I don't think this is a good idea. I've seen worse. Besides, it looks like they're moving. Bet you their neighbors are glad about that. Are you gonna get that, Daddy? Yeah, I think I can make it perfect for your room. Shouldn't take me too long either. Oh yes, 'cause you're so good at woodworking, right? Well, we might as well take advantage of your uncle's old workshop since we're gonna be there awhile. Are you gonna paint it purple? I'll paint it any color you like, how about that? Mommy, look. Look at these. I had one like this when I was a little girl. His name was Teddy. Hmm. Can I hold him? Your name is Ricky, isn't it? Not Teddy. Sorry, how much? It's a very special little bear. Do you want it to be yours, sweetheart? We just want to know how much you want for the bear. For this little girl, it's free. All she has to do is keep him warm and safe. He's a family member. How much you want for the little table? K, move aside. Come on, keep an eye on Meg. I'll see what I can do. Yes, almighty Tetris queen. Look, I can get this in here, but do we seriously need this piece of crap? The house is crowded enough as is with all of Uncle Eli's stuff. Here. Really, Beth? I just wanted to make something that made our home feel like our own. Something that was actually ours. I know, I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have said anything. I just know I'm the one who put us in this situation and I guess part of recovery is acknowledging the blame, so. Look, I'm really grateful that you stood by me. And I know how lucky I am to still have you and Meg and... All this can make me feel a little... Scared and useless. And when I feel like that, I lash out and it's shitty of me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. - No, it's... - Beth. You are one of the strongest people I know. And we made it through the tough times because I knew you'd get better. And you did. Beth, I love you so much. I am so proud of you. Please, don't be scared. I'm not going anywhere. Meg. Where is she? - That girl has no boundaries. - Yeah, well life will teach her too many boundaries soon enough. Let's not wish that upon her. I'm not wishing anything on her. I'm talking about keeping her safe. Hey Meg, it's time to answer me, please. - Meg! - Meg! Meg, Meg. Meg, talk to me, Meg. Meg, what is it? - What is it? - Jack! Meg, did you eat something? - Meg, come on, look at me. - Jack, what is that? Meg, come on, give me something here, Meg, please. Help her, help! Did you eat something? Come on, give me something here, Meg. - Meg, please, Meg. - Meg! - What is it? What happened? - Jack, do something! I think Meg should see a new therapist. I don't feel like Ashe is helping very much. Yeah, I agree. I'm kinda over that whole worry bully stuff. I know, right? And I really want to figure out what's going on with her stomach. I mean, my stomach hurt all the time as a kid. I just want her here with me sometimes. It's not fair that you get to decide. Even when we moved, Meg didn't complain about her stomach when you got fired. I feel like it's a tactic. I feel like she's trying to find ways to stay home. Mm-hmm. Okay so pretty much what you're saying is that it's my fault. Okay. Okay. I don't know, maybe you're right. And maybe the timing of everything is for the best, she'll... And I'll be home if she needs me, right? Believe me, that's the last thing we need. We need to get out - of this situation. - Hey, I know. Mommy. I mean, come... Want to just go home? Yeah? Yeah, okay. Okay, babycakes. Time for bed. I told you, off your tablet. Let's go. Nice try, but I saw you. Stop it. Meg, let go, please. Thank you. Did I ever tell you about the day I met your mommy? She was about your age and you look exactly like her. Well, she was here visiting her Uncle Eli and I was in the backyard pruning my rosebush, and she would stop and pretend like she was looking somewhere else when I tried to get her eye. But I knew she wanted to know what I was doing. So I finally did catch her eye and I smiled at her. And I think that made her brave enough to come over. And when she walked up to me, I handed her a rose. It was such a beautiful pale pink rose. And she looked up at me with the sweetest smile. And we've been fast friends ever since. And I think that you and I are fast friends now, just like me and your mommy. No, huh? Okay. You want me to sing you a song before I go? Just go. Okay. Night night, don't let the bed bugs bite. So I went back and checked on her just a little while ago and had to take her tablet away from her again. But the poor little thing, she's so exhausted. She's gonna be asleep soon. You think I should - check on her or... - It sounds like she's calming down. She needs to get used to falling asleep without you. I could tell that she was a little sad, so I tried to distract her and it worked for a little bit. We danced for awhile. But then she said that she had a stomachache and wanted to be alone in her room. I realized I should've taken the tablet away sooner. Sorry about that. That's my fault, I shouldn't have told her she could use it. That's, I don't know, it's all a little bit new for us. Hmm. Hey, we couldn't do this without you. You help keep this family sane. Oh no, no, no. - Oh, come on. - This is on me. - Nope, it's on me. - Come on. I'm happy you guys had a night out together. - Thank you, goodnight. - Thank you, Marissa. - We really appreciate you. - You bet. Sounds like she's asleep. It's the little steps, right? Yeah. Meg. Oh, Jesus. Meg, sweetie. Hey, you need to go to bed. Hey. Hey, are you okay, sweetie? Meg. Hey, Meggie, Meg. Hey, did you have a bad dream, hmm? Okay, come on. It's okay, lay down. Okay, all right. Here you go. Close your eyes. Mommy. Jack. Crap. - Mommy? - Ssh, hi. You don't have to get up yet, okay? Don't leave. I love you. I'll be right back, okay? - I love you. - Okay, go back to sleep. Jack, she... She called out, okay? And then I think she was sleepwalking or, I don't know, at least I think she was sleepwalking. You seemed okay with me checking on her before. Checking on her, I get. I understand, I just, when you spend all night with her, it's just, I just really miss having you next to me. Oh. Listen. Just give me a call after your meeting with Ashe. And I'll see you later. Okay, hold on. Okay, I gave in, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry too. Last night I was, I was a real asshole. Mm, mm-hmm. Comes naturally. Wow. That's cute. All right, I'll see you later. Mm, Jack, here. Hey, I am trying. I know you are. We're both trying. I'll see you tonight. Can I just stay one day with you? No, sweetie. We're here to talk to Mr. Taylor, okay? And then you need to go to class. Meg. Why don't you want to be at school today? Please, just one day? Meg. You need to answer me. I can't help you if you don't answer me. Why do you want to go home? Because. My tummy hurts. And sometimes my throat. Yep, yep, and this is what is getting worse. I'm sorry to hear that, Meg. Can you describe to me again what the pain feels like? Feels like I'm hungry, really hungry. I'm gonna recommend that you guys set up an appointment with Meg's pediatrician so we can rule out any digestive or food sensitivity issues, of course. Okay, well we already have that appointment set for next week, so. Good. But I don't think that's the case. You know what I think? I think it's the worry monster being a big old bully again. Meg, do you miss your mom a lot when you're not with her? Yes. Does your stomach and throat hurt only when you miss her? Yes. That's a mean old monster, huh? I want to thank you for coming in. I know it's probably uncomfortable being here right now. But since you're here, is there anything extra... Is Meg okay? I mean, I mean, she's so attached to me now and she's still so attached to her bear, Ricky, and I don't know, last night I found her sitting up in bed and she was staring at nothing and I just thought... What? You thought what? Nothing. I don't know, it's just hard for me. She's so much like I was. Or I don't know, like I am now and... But she wasn't at first, right? She was fearless and I just thought that she wouldn't be like me and... I don't know, even through, all the... Yeah. She was never attached like this to me or to Jack and definitely not to some stuffed animal, so. Well, there's really nothing unusual about her behavior. She's pretty typical of a kid that's suffering from anxiety. And the bear, Ricky, is her comfort object. He helps her feel safe. And after he seizure at the park, you know, her attachment to you, her mother and her caregiver, it makes more sense. It really scared her. Or it could be some belated anxiety. The fear of losing you when you were struggling. She could've buried that and the incident triggered some repressed emotion. Listen, Beth, I, no, I think that Meg is lucky to have you as a mom. I really do, I mean, especially since you can understand what she's going through right now. But you have to remember that you're an example. You're an example of how to be strong, an example of how to recover from a tough time. Yeah. But to go back to your original question, yeah, yeah, I do think that the anxiety is getting worse. She understands the idea of a worry monster and I think the coping skills I'm teaching her are helping her get through the school day but I'm gonna recommend a psychiatrist outside of school. She's really good. And depending on what her pediatrician says, it... It may be time for some low grade medication. - No, I'm not... - Listen, I understand. It's just, she just may need a little help until she gets older and develops more mature coping skills. So let's get her back to class, huh? Okay. Hey, Meg. Meg, come on, come on. Well, we ran over just a bit, didn't we? I actually have to get to another student. But Meg, can you do me a favor? Hey, Meg? Can you do me a favor and show your mom how brave you can be by going to class? Yeah. Come on. Well Meg, hey, I'm gonna walk you to your classroom but then I need to go, okay? Can you say thank you to Mr. Taylor? That's okay, it's all right. You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you later, okay? - Thank you. - All right. Bye, Meg. Okay honey, come on. - Don't want... - Meg. No, don't make me go to class. Okay, Meg, hey look, it's gonna be a short day, okay, 'cause of our meeting. So you'll only be here a few hours, okay? - Meg, Meg. - Please. - You need to go to class. - I want to stay with you. Okay, Meg, Meg! Okay, look, you need to go to class. Okay, come on, let's go. No. Okay, well I'm leaving. This is your last chance for me to walk you to class. Okay Meg, that's as far as I'm going, okay? - My stomach. - No. Okay, hey, look. You need to go to class, okay? It's right over there. Meg, Meg, Meg, stop! Okay, I love you, okay? More than you know. But I'll see you very soon. No, stop. Mommy. Mr. Bertram, can you please send Theodore Hutchins to the office to meet his father? What is that? Is that hair? It is hair. You little shit. I'm telling your teacher. Go ahead, she won't believe you. You aren't supposed to be out here anyway. Where's your pass? Wait a minute, I know who you are. And I know about your mom. No wonder you're such a freak. Don't you ever touch my stuff, it's mine. Meg! Are you okay? Yeah. Okay, just go back to class for now. I'll check in later. Meg, we need to talk. Look, I know you're struggling right now, but that behavior is absolutely unacceptable and won't be tolerated. Do you understand? I'm sorry, Mrs. Jean. I just got frustrated. Please believe me. Oh I do, I do. Listen, we'll talk about this later, okay? You're not off the hook. All right kids, settle down, please. Meg, eat your dinner, please. Can I have cereal? - No, this is dinner. - Well you can have some chocolate milk and - a banana if you... - Hold on. Please, eat a little more of your dinner and you can have some chocolate milk. You can have a banana now though, go ahead. Can't just feed her crap all the time. You can't always give into her. I don't always give in. Listen, I got a call from Mrs. Jean today. Apparently Meg got into an altercation with another student. What? I don't know all the details but apparently it was an older student so they have to look into it. So an older student hurt Meg. Why didn't Miss Jean call me? No, it sounds like Meg's the one that got physical, and you know why Miss Jean didn't call you. I just think she needs more discipline instead of everyone caving into her. I mean, we've been bending over backwards for her for a long time now. Ah, absolutely not, put it back. Okay, hey, hey, no. We need to talk more about this later, okay? Okay. Meggie. I need you to be a big girl and put yourself to bed tonight, okay? I need Mommy to sing to me, I need it! Okay, okay, okay, look. Hey Meg, we'll do your special song and our kiss, okay? But I will not lay down with you. I know you can do this, sweetie. I remember when you were about four years old and you found a black snake. You wrapped it around your neck like a scarf. All the other kids ran away from you. You wanted to keep it as a pet. Mommy was terrified, do you remember that? I don't remember that. Please, Daddy? No, sweetie. You need to start listening to me and stop arguing all the time. And that goes with everyone. Including your classmates and your teachers, right? Things are gonna change around here. I hate him. No, no. No, sweetie, you don't. Yes, I do. Come here, can you please try and eat something for me, hmm? Please eat your food for me. The animals stopped to listen. They could hear and sense a shift. In the breeze, something was coming. Bear turned to cue. Mommy? Hmm, yeah? Do you miss me during the day? Yes, of course I do. Did you miss your parents when they were gone? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. But it was a different time and way of raising kids. Why don't you talk about them? Oh, honey. It's complicated, hmm? I just hope I can be a better parent to you than mine were to me. I'm sorry you don't have a mom and dad anymore. Well, I have you, hmm? And I have your dad. And you two are all I need. Are you still trying to get another teaching job? Why yes, Meg, I am. But I haven't heard anything yet. Good. That is not very supportive. We can't do this, don't. Please, don't make me do this. Please. All right. Meg? Meg, what are you doing up? Where's your coat? Honey, you should be in bed. What's going on, honey? Meg? I'm sorry, Daddy. Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg. Put that down! Oh Meg, okay, that's enough sugar. Hey, I said that is, stop. That's enough. You can eat it like that, okay? Okay, Meg, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna take this call really quick, okay? Hello, this is Beth. Yes. Yes, I'm still interested in the position. Okay. Oh yeah, I can absolutely be available for the interview. Okay, no, that's great. Thank you, Mrs. Waters. Okay. All right, we'll see you later. Bye. Meg. Don't leave me. I'm here for Meg. Mommy's favorite color is blue. Mommy's gonna leave me soon. Well, I didn't know that, Meg. Where is your mom going? I need her with me. I need her ready. But it's so hard to wait. Well, I don't understand, Meg. You just, first you said that your mom's leaving, and now you're saying you're waiting for her to be ready. I don't understand. Meg, did you make that sound? What sound? The clicking sound with your tongue there. It's okay if you did. A lot of kids have self-soothing methods. Meg. You need to let go. Meg, remember our rule, this... This is a safe space for everyone. I didn't make that sound but I know what did. Meg, you need to let go. I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor. Please don't tell my mommy. It's... It's okay, it's okay. You just have to remember that in here, we use our words and not our bodies. What time you taking off in the morning? I want to hit the road at about six. I'm just... Just not sure it's a good idea. What? Come on, I don't understand your attitude about this. This would be a second income for us, some stability. And we might even be able to move back to the old neighborhood. Yeah, I'm just really worried about Meg. I just... I just don't think you should leave her. Well, hey. She let you put her to bed tonight. That's a big step, right? Right. I'm just really worried about her and I think you should be too. Okay, that's not fair. Okay, I haven't worked in forever and you know how guilty I feel about that. How guilty you've made me feel about that. And you of all people know how worried I am about her. I'm sorry. That was a shitty thing to say. I didn't mean it. Maybe I could give you a massage. Make it up to you. Okay. Yeah, right there. There, okay. That's not a massage. Yeah, it is. Okay, at least let me close the door, okay? We don't have to, it'll be okay. Tell me you like it. Hey, let me at least close the door real quick. It's okay. It's not, Jack. Tell me you like it. Come on, tell me. Jack, stop. Damn it! Damn it. Great. We just need to do this. She's not ready if the egg's not ready. I need it. She's not ready. Jack. Jack, what's going on? You took a bad fall. Meg and I are taking care of you. It's okay. Did you give me something? Shouldn't I be at the hospital? We took you to the hospital, honey. You don't remember? The doctor said you just need to stay still, okay? And rest. We can take care of you, and yes, the doctor prescribed some medication just to help manage the pain. It's okay. - No, Jack, I don't... - It's okay. It's okay, the doctor gave you the prescription. I told him your history. You're strong, Beth, but you need to stay in bed. I know what's best for you. We both love you very much. We just want to take care of you. Here, Mommy. It's okay, it's okay. Trust me, it's gonna be okay. It's all right. Help, Meg! It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Jack. Aren't you glad you didn't leave? If you'd left, you wouldn't be here with us. Jack, I... Jack, I think I have to, I need to get up, I think. No, no, no, no. - No, no, no. - No, I can't, listen. I think... I think I'm feeling better and I need to call Mrs. Waters and explain. Where's my phone? I already talked to her and I explained that you need to stay home. No, but I want to. I want to go back to work. - I want to go back to work. - I know, I know, I know. Shouldn't have tried to go, Beth. - No. - And I'm only saying that because I love you. You and Meg are everything to me, but we cannot have another incident like this happen. It's not fair to us. I keep having these dreams and... And I don't understand. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. So tired. Jack, hi, this is Ashe Taylor. I've been trying to get in touch with Beth, but I wasn't having any luck. Meg has missed several days of school, and well, I need to talk to you both, actually, about an incident that happened during our last session. Please give me a call, thanks. John Marcus and Rob Dylan to the principal's office. Hey, thanks for getting down here so quick. I really appreciate it. Please sit down. I see you brought Teddy. Need a little extra comfort today, or? Yes. Okay, well. I noticed that Meg's missed several days of school. Is everything okay? Her... Her mom was in an accident. Wow, I didn't know. Do we need to reschedule this? - I mean, I understand if you... - No, no. It's a good distraction. Okay, well. Now this must be horrible for Meg. For everyone, of course, but especially for Meg. And I hate to talk about this now but I have to file an incident report with my supervisor and the school. And I just wanted to talk to you about it first. Whenever there's a physical altercation, a report has to be filed and there are timeframes for things like this. And also, I think it's best for Meg and for myself that I don't see her anymore. I just don't think I can help her. I think she may need more serious help than I first thought. I've just never... I've never had a child react that way and from what I've been reading, it may indicate some form of psychosis. I really hate to be giving you more bad news at a time like this but at this moment in time, - I just really don't see... - Just... Yeah, no, please, I'm sorry. So what you're saying, I just want to get this straight. Of course. You're saying that my daughter hurt you. - Yes, I... - My... Little bitty girl daughter hurt you. Big old you, a grown ass man. I bet Meg would say otherwise. The two of you all alone in this office together. I bet... No, I need to stop you right there. My intention has always been to help Meg. And right now, I am truly worried about your daughter. Hey. I'm sorry, man, are you okay? Are you okay? Please. Won't be long now. I don't like waiting. Waiting for your mommy to join us? She loves you very much. And so do I. But I would never leave you like she tried to, Meg. No, you're wrong. What did you say? I told Ricky he was wrong. What's Ricky wrong about? He told me that it would be easy. I don't know what you mean. He told me that he would make her stay, but he didn't tell me how hard it would be. I think you're being very brave, sweetheart. And I don't think your mommy's ever gonna leave you ever again. Not anymore. Maybe it won't be so hard when the time comes. I'm here for you. Forever and always. And if there's anything I can do for you, anything at all, I will. You aren't enough and you never will be. Hey. You want to draw a picture with me, like we used to? Good morning, Mommy. Hey. Good morning, sweetie. Hey, did you bring me my, here they are, sweetie. Hey, you don't have to worry about Mommy taking these pills, right? I'm all better and I wouldn't mess up again. This looks good. But maybe you can help me get up. Do you know where my phone is, sweetie? You don't need your phone. I don't want you to get better 'cause if you do then you'll try to leave again. No, hey. No, Meggie. Meggie, come here. Stay down! Meg! Good morning, need anything? Could you close the door, please? Sure. Oh God, it's so good to see you. That was really thoughtful of Jack to call you. Hey, I'm a little worried about Meg. With me being hurt and all, I... Meg is as fine as she can be with almost losing her mother. If she's angry, she has a good reason to be. Don't you think? Yeah but I think if I could just get up... Yeah, don't have any expectations. Just give her what she needs. It's gonna take time for us to all adjust to our lives together. Just do your job. Okay, okay. I would do anything for her. You should too. Hey, Meggie. You take good care of your mommy now. You should ask to see her notebook. Her pictures are quite inspiring. Hey Meg, Meg, hey. I'd love to see your drawings, hmm? They're stupid. No. No, they're not. You've always been a really good artist, hmm? Can you get them? I'd really like to see them. Hey, are those your drawings? Yeah? All right, let's see what we got here, huh? Okay. Oh, that's pretty. Hey Meg, do you want to talk about Ricky? No. I noticed Ricky because I had a bear just like him when I was your age. Did you talk to him? All the time. Yeah, he was my best friend. Did he talk back? Mm-hmm, yeah. I guess in my head he did. And he was my first kiss. Hey, Meg. I was just trying to make you laugh. Come on, what is this all about, huh? Nothing. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. Come here. Oh, come here, come here. Snuggle with me. All right, let's see. Meg, what is this? Hmm, what'd you just say? Meg. Hey, Meg. Meg. Meg, Meg! - Hey, Meg! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't mean... What's going on? You okay, Meg? Yeah, sorry, I thought you were gone. Yeah well I can't be away from my girls for too long. Huh. Well, I'm glad you're both here. I've actually been doing some thinking. That's all I've been doing lately. And I think I need to cut back on those pills. They're, I don't know, they're making me really foggy, just a little bit. And I think it's best if Meg goes back to school tomorrow, okay? I mean, I need some time to rest alone. Just to reorient myself. I'm gonna call the doctor tomorrow. And I need to find my phone. And I have some errands to run, so. Jack, I'm better, really. Oh boy. We've heard that before, haven't we, sweetie? Okay no, no, that isn't what I'm talking... You know, Beth? I think you're really tired. We should go and we can talk about this tomorrow. Yeah but Jack, didn't you hear anything about what I just said? Oh, you're funny, Mommy. I love you more than anything. Thank you. Ricky's going to sleep with you tonight. I think you're almost ready. Okay. Mommy. Give it time. But Mommy. You heard her. She said she was gonna leave you again. I'm not ready. Jack, Jack, open up! Jack, Jack, please, come in here! Jack! I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. - Please, Meg, I'm sorry. - Jack, get it out! Get it out! Help, Jack, please, get in here! Jack! Jack, Jack, Jack, it's in here. Okay, it's in here, I saw it. - I saw it in my dream. - Calm down. - Beth, please. - No, this is what... - Beth, you're acting crazy. - This is what Meg was drawing about, please. - Just get it out. - Beth! - Please, please! - Shut up, you fucking junkie bitch! Give me Ricky. Let's go, sweetie. I'm sorry Mommy did that to you. What the hell is this? What was that? Your mouths, what was in your mouths? Beth, you're not thinking clearly. You've had a bad brain injury, you're on heavy medication. You're probably hallucinating some crazy shit. Marissa, I want you to get out of my house. Meg, you know I have to stay with you and Jack. I said get out or I will call the police. Oh, and what are you gonna tell them? That you're a selfish bitch that leaves her family? That's addicted to painkillers? Makes her family lose everything? Sees things everywhere that aren't there and can't even satisfy - her own husband? - Shut up! Come on, let me stay. We can be a family. I can help you be who you need to be. You have to let me stay. I said get out. Wow. Don't you think you're overreacting - a little bit? - No, Jack, I want you to leave too. And what are you gonna do if I don't? Daddy, you don't have to leave. Mommy, please, let's go. Mommy, please, can we go? Beth, Beth, I love you. No, no, I don't know who you are anymore, Jack. No, you put your hands on me. You put your hands on your daughter. And what the fuck was that with Marissa? I don't know - what's happening. - Was that what was in Ricky? It was, I mean, it was in your mouth. - What is it? What is going on? - Don't know what's going on! I just think there's something wrong with you. I'm seriously worried about you, Beth. No, no, Jack. You need to leave or I will call the police. Don't tempt me, get out. Get out! Meg, I'll always be near. Mommy will figure it out. Don't worry. Mommy, are you gonna make me leave too? No, hey, no. No, no, no, I would never, ever do that, okay? Hey, I just, I need some time away from your Daddy, okay? Just some time to think, hmm? Why did you hurt Ricky? Okay, no, I thought I saw something in him, okay? I was confused. - Ricky forgives you. - Okay, hey, hey. Look, hey, we're gonna be okay. I know, I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's time for your medicine, Mommy. Let's get you back in bed. Let's lay down and make you feel better. Meg. Meg, is there someone in the house? Is it your daddy? It's just you and me, Mommy. No, uh-uh. No, I need to keep a clear head, okay? No more medication. God, I don't like this. Honey, you look so tired. Come here, come here. How many days have you been out of school, huh? Okay, I have to stop this, Meg. This isn't right. You want me to be happy, right? Mm-hmm. You hurt me when you took my daddy away. That made me sad, it made me scared. - Okay. - I feel safe here. Okay. Okay. Hey, I think we should call the school tomorrow. Okay, just... Just to check in though. Meg, I need to get outta this house. Okay, I need to get things figured out and... I think I need to talk to someone. Someone like Mr. Taylor. Huh? I need to go to work and you need to go to school. I'll tell everyone how you keep seeing things and how confused you are. They'll come to the house and see how dirty it is. They'll take me to my daddy. Would you want that, Mommy? No, no. Hey, look, I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry I messed up before. Okay, but this isn't the same thing. I'm all better now, you know that, right? Hmm? Look, I just need to sleep a little bit and then we'll get all this figured out, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Meg? Mommy, look what I built for you. I can't wait anymore. We have to, the egg. It's not time. Jack. Jack. Beth, honey, just try and relax. - Just breathe. - Jack! - Beth. - Jack, no! You'll be okay. Think about Meg. Be strong for Meg. Should give her the shot. She struggles to reject the nesting process. Not time yet. Mommy. Sometimes I dream that I was still a little baby inside your belly. You were such a beautiful baby. When I first held you in my arms, I... I was so in love. Love I'd never felt before. And what a personality you had. I knew you would take over the world. Did you like it when I was a little baby? Yeah. Though I love you even more now than I ever thought possible. I just... I wish the day in the park had never happened. That I could've been strong for you. That I could've been the one to save you. And even before that, I... I wish I'd been a better mother. And I wasn't so weak. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. You don't have to be sorry. I almost have everything I need. What else do you need, sweetie? I need you to be like me. Okay. Okay. Your head is hurting, isn't it? I can tell. How about after you take your medicine, we can go get in the bath and relax? Mommy, it's okay, you're beautiful. Meg, what are we doing, hmm? Meggie, I have all my clothes on. You're taking such good care of me, Meg. I should be the one taking care of you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Mommy. - Yeah. I want you to be with me all the time. I know. I know, I... I do too. You have to do something for me, Mommy. Okay. Okay, anything. Anything, sweetheart. I love you so much. - It'll all be over soon. - Okay. Okay. Hey, can I have him? I don't know, he is pretty creepy.
