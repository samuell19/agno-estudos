- Let's go over it one more time. What happened after that? Answer the question. What happened after that? - I was talking to him. - Where were you when that happened? - A few feet away. - Did you try to stop him? Answer the question. Did you try to stop him? Answer the question. Did you try to stop him? - Have you ever had a moment when your mind was completely free, blank? No thoughts at all I mean. Empty. Peaceful. I was looking for that my whole life, but all I ever found was obsession, darkness, cold, deep darkness. - And what happened after the phone call? - The station sent two officers to check the apartment. - Sir, this is the police. Put the gun down. - They found Jay on his knees, pointing the gun to his own head, frozen. They kept calling him, but he wasn't moving. - I could feel it. A painful crack in my chest, My ribs falling apart. Bones crumbling. I had to learn how to deal with it. - The main door was cracked open, and they could see someone laying on the floor. That became the priority. - But now I knew what it is. It was you. You are always in the air. I was breathing you. Hey, shh, shh, shh. Everything's gonna be okay. I know what I need to do now. - There were mirror stands everywhere, all broken. A pool a blood from one side to the other. It was too late. The victim was stabbed in the stomach with a shard of glass. - You're the one who smokes. Not me. - I've never seen anything like this before. He wasn't moving, and his eyes were wide open, staring into the distance. - Just like Judie said. - I remember. I remember everything. - Everything is gonna be okay. I promise. - Our beloved Judie faced this disease in the same way... She was an example to all of us, always putting the needs of others before her own. Judie was a good daughter. She was great sister to Jay. And she was a friend. A real friend. She only asked for one thing before she passed. I'm glad that we can all be here today to do this for her. She always loved the light here. This is where she wanted to be. Judie... we'll never forget you. - I'm so sorry for your loss, Jay. I want you to know that the entire crew is with you. - Jay. We never met before, but I knew your sister, and I'm really sorry for your loss. She was a very special, special person. Take care of yourself. I wish you well. - How dare you? How dare you bring one of your sluts here? Do you have no respect for your sister? Shame on you. - You're just jealous. Jealous I finally have somebody else in my life except for you. - Don't play with me, kid. This is family stuff. This is family. Our family. - Yeah, well, maybe that's family now. - Don't be stupid. You don't even know these people. Is that the watch? Shame on you. - Can you tell me about your relationship with his sister? - I was her therapist for the last eight years. She died of cancer about six months ago. The only time I ever met Jay was at his sister's funeral. - Did they tell you who the victim is? - But I don't understand, detective. Why do you need me here? - No. - Is everything okay? - I'm fine. - I saw your mother talking to you. She was staring at me the whole time. - Don't worry about her. - Probably wasn't the best idea for me to come. - Don't say that. - No, I didn't belong there. - You do belong there. You're family. She needs to understand that. She's always trying to control my fucking life. I'm sick of her. - I understand. But she seemed pretty... - She's just like that. You know what she's like. - No, I don't. Jay, seriously, how could I know that? I'm just saying maybe it wasn't the best idea to introduce me at your sister's funeral. - What are you talking about? - How did he wake up, detective? What did you do? - I did nothing. I just called him by his name. Jay... Can you hear me? He didn't know how he got there, what happened in his house, or why he was trying to kill himself. - No. - Mm! This is delicious. Did you make it? - Yes. All fresh and organic. - Mm! - It's from the store, right? - That's right. - What store? - Jay didn't tell you? I run a distribution company of organic and mostly vegetarian food. And last year I opened a brick and mortar store downtown. - It's actually where we met. - So you were the client falling in love with the owner. - Maybe. Maybe it's the other way around. - Hmm. Maybe. - Let's start from the beginning. How did you get to this point? - He called 911 himself a few hours ago. Sergeant, can you play the recording please? - He's trying to do it again. I can't allow it. Not this time. I think I know how to stop him. This is wrong. Shut up! - Who's he talking to? We think it's possible there may have been someone else there. - He brought her to my house. He brought her here. - And what happened after the phone call? - So you're a vegetarian now? - I like to eat healthy. - Just saying, have you seen yourself in the mirror? - The mirror? What about the mirror? - I've never seen you so skinny. And I hardly see you. - Can you stop? You wanna stop telling me what to do? - Hey, hey, come on. Let's not get into one of your fights right now. Okay? Let's just enjoy this dinner. - I'm just saying you need your protein, or I'm gonna be seeing your bones very soon. - Meat is not the only way to get protein. We can all get plenty without eating meat. - Are you one of those animal lovers? - Yes, I am. You have any pets? - We used to have a dog many years ago when these two guys were kids and living in the country with me. - What was his name? - Roy. His name was Roy. - Do you guys remember him? - Vaguely. - You were very little, maybe eight or nine. - What happened to Roy... if I may ask. - Someone left the door open, and he ran away. - Ran away? - Yeah. Simple as that. He left. See, it isn't true that animals always love you. - There's something... something very dark in this family that I was never quite able to see. Judie had been keeping a secret for over 20 years to protect her little brother. But there's a time in one of our sessions that she told me about something that happened in the country house. Jay was only eight years old. Something happened with their dog. - So how's work, sweetheart? - It's... fine. We closed down the contract this week, and um... They start in a couple weeks. - Good. I hope you'll be able to afford a better place than this soon. - Jay... I'm so proud of you. Congratulations. Congrats. - Congrats. - What? - Yeah, what, mom? Stop it. - We don't need guns here. Okay? Just calm down, Jay. Guys, lower the guns. - At this point, we're not rushing. We're just taking the time to negotiate. All right, Jay. Now it's your turn. Put your gun down so we can talk. Slowly. Very slowly. I'm going outside to smoke. - You said you were gonna stop. - Give me a break, Mom. Hm? - Judie, you shouldn't be smoking in your condition. - She's actually right, you know. - I'm gonna die anyways, right? So just let me enjoy the time that I have left. You wanna smoke? - Oh, no thanks. I don't smoke. - It's okay. You don't have to be shy if you wanna smoke. Go with her. - No, Jay. I don't smoke. I never did, But I will join you outside for some fresh air. - All right. Let's have some girl talk. - Just like Judie said. - This happened before? - Not while I knew her, and not like this. I mean, Judie did talk about how Jay had some strange experiences in his sleep as a child, but after we discussed it some more, I realized it was just sleep paralysis. It can be pretty disturbing if you don't know what it is. It's kind of the state in between being awake and dreaming. Your mind is aware, but your muscles are relaxed as if you're still asleep. You can think clearly, but you might also have visions, too, which makes it extremely unclear what is real and what is the dream. You have no voluntary muscular control. It's like being trapped in your own body. You can see, but you might also have flashes from your dreams as well, because the door to the unconscious mind hasn't quite closed yet. - Don't be afraid. Do you remember me? She wouldn't let see you for a long time, your sister, but I never left you. Now that she is gone, there is one more thing you have to do. Remember. Remember. Do you remember me? Remember. - Jay. - Do you remember me now? - Jay, wake up! - I'm Dr. Rivers. I was called here to assist. - Thank you for coming. Please have a seat. Wait here for a moment. - He's here. - What did he say to you? The cop. Was it about me? - No, Jay. It was not about you. But I have to leave for a moment. - Why? It was about me, wasn't it? - I just need a few moments, Jay. Just a few minutes. Everything's fine, I promise. Are you gonna be okay? - Just a few minutes. Okay. Be quick. - Jay? Can you hear me? - Judie. What are you doing here? - Thank you for coming. I am Diana Suarez, the detective in charge of this case, You have already met Sergeant Marquez, who's directing the police response. As you can see, we're dealing with a very complicated situation here. - I was her therapist for the last... Why do you need me? Something happened with their dog. - Jay's talking to me as if I was his sister. - Did she follow the procedure? Officer, I need you to answer the question. - I think she saw the opportunity to connect with him. - I understand that it's difficult to believe that he sees Judie instead of you, but our mind can affect the way that we experience the world and what we call reality. We see what we want or what we need to see. And right now, Jay needs his sister. Maybe... Maybe we can take advantage of that. It's a long shot, but we might be able to use the connection that he has with Judie to delve into his unconscious. - How do we go about doing that? - If it was sleep paralysis, he wouldn't have been able to move or speak, but he still would have been a conscious, silent witness. He just doesn't remember it. - It's worth a shot. But how do I keep the illusion going? I made it work for a while, but having a confrontation is very different. - Connect on the same emotional level. We all have secrets. Think back to something that you feel responsible for, to something that you feel guilty about. Bring it forward. Project it onto Jay just like Judie did. Our mind is an incredible tool. It has a way of connecting us on a number of different levels that we can't even understand or comprehend. We need to guide Jay to that part of his unconscious that he shares with Judie. That's where we're gonna find the broken memories of what happened here. - Do you want to talk about it? - You want a drink? - I'm good. - There was something different this time. - What was it? - I saw who was keeping the dog in the leash. It was a kid. - A kid? - Yeah. - Who was he? - I don't know. - What did he look like? - He wore a mask on half his face. This side. The whole left side. - So you don't know what he looks like? - He showed me, but I couldn't see. I think he hurt himself. - Hey... It's okay. You're tired, Jay. It was a stressful day yesterday at the funeral. It was a big deal. All this is gonna take time. - There was something else. The kid... He said he'd been with me the whole time. - Hey... Jay... - I don't wanna... Don't touch me. - Jay. - Don't fucking touch me. - Jay, Jay, Jay. It was just a dream. It was a dream. It was just a dream. It was a dream! Jay. - Okay. - Well, what was it then? - Dr. Rivers, I've set up a line for you. Detective Suarez will hear everything that you say. I've also set up a camera with a view of everything that is happening in the yard. You can see it on that screen right there. - You want to protect Jay. Judie wants to protect him from the world, from other people, from himself too. Remember, it's all about Jay. There's no resistance. - Where have you been? You said a few minutes. - I know. - Only a few minutes. That's what you said to me. - Yes, I know. I know. You're right. I'm sorry, okay? But I'm here now. Like always. Jay, I just wanna talk. Like we always did. - She cares about him. - I'm worried about you. I've never seen you like this before. I feel for you. There must be a reason why you would point a gun to your head. - I'm trying. I'm trying really hard, but I... I can't remember. - There's one thing that Judie always said about Jay. Hidden fear. He may seem distant, but he's deeply tormented inside. Go with it. You feel what he feels. - I'm scared, Jay. I'm scared. Because I know how painful it is not to remember. - I'm broken. - You need to connect with that. - I can't put all the pieces together. - Use that connection. - Yes we can. Yes we can. We can do it together, you and I. Okay? - And dig deep into his memories, starting with the last thing that he remembers. - What is the last thing that you remember? - Last night, I fell asleep. I passed out and I... I woke up here. I don't know how. - What did you do last night? - I was just drinking. - Were you alone? - He left me. He left me, Judie. So I started to drink. I passed out and he wasn't here. - Did he say "he"? - He? - I didn't do this. I didn't kill him. I loved him. - The person that he sees on the floor is not the same person that we see. You need to stay with that memory. Follow that. - I know. I know you didn't. - I thought things were good between us. Did you notice anything weird the last time you saw him? - Judie never said anything about this. - No. No, I didn't. Why do you think he broke up with you? - We had a fight. - So you saw him last night? He was here? - No, I mean before that. We went out for dinner, and there was this girl there. She was staring at me the whole time as if she knew me. She looked mean, made me feel like I'd done something bad to her. - Keep looking at? - Sean noticed what was going on, so I tell him about this girl and... - Sean. - He looks at her and... he doesn't know her either. - Do you know her? She's staring. - She finally stands up and walks towards our table. She stands in front of me without saying a word. She's just staring at me. So I say something like... Do I know you? "Do I know you?" - She flashes this smile, this fake smile. And then she pours her drink on my lap. And then she says... - It turns me on how wet you are. I love to feel it between my fingers. I wanna fuck you. I wanna fuck you now. - And then she turns to Sean and she says. - That's what he said to me three days ago. Tuesday night. Just like every Tuesday for the last year. - And then she just leaves. Maybe this is all my fault. - What makes you feel that way? - What makes you feel that way? - We went back home and he wasn't even talking to me, so I pushed him. I already told you I have never seen her before. - Jay, I was right in front of you. You know what? I'm tired. And it's not about what just happened. I didn't want to say anything, but... - I brought up some things, things that had been bothering me for the last couple of weeks. I told him he felt different. - Since the funeral you've become... - He became... - Distant. - Distant. - Aggressive. - Aggressive. - Mean. - I didn't say anything until last night, but everything started the day after the funeral. - I told him... I felt like I didn't even know him anymore. - I don't even know you anymore, Jay. I really don't know you. - He left. He left me, Judie. - I'm sorry everything fell apart. But this is probably how it's supposed to be. Goodbye, Jay. Take care of yourself. - So last night, after he left, you did not see him again. - No. I never saw him again until now. - What the fuck was that? What kind of asshole are you to pretend you don't know me? I'm talking to you, asshole! You don't even have the balls to look at me? Are you still pretending you don't know me? I only came here for one reason. This piece of shit belongs to you, to your fucking family. I don't want anything more from you. You sick fuck! - Do you really remember nothing after that? - I was just drinking. I passed out, and I woke up pointing this fucking gun to my head. Everything started the day after the funeral. - You said "he". You said Sean... started changing after the funeral. - Yeah. Pretty sure it was that same night. - What funeral was that? - What do you mean? - I'm just a little bit confused. There are so many things going on. I'm just a little bit nervous, and I've been to more than one funeral over the last few months. - I'm talking about the last time you saw Sean. At mom's funeral. - Holy shit. - Judie. - He's projecting his mother's funeral over Judie's. - Hey, Judie... - Yes, yes. - Ask him when the funeral was. - Jay, do you remember what day that funeral was? - Is something wrong with you right now? - I am just trying to remember something that happened on that very same day. - It was Thursday. It was two weeks ago. - He has blacked out the last six months. There must be something more than what just happened here. Judie's death must have triggered some old broken memories, 'cause he's created a lot of false memories that he actually truly believes but to the extent that I've never seen anything like it before. Remembering things differently than the way that they actually happened is not uncommon. He's actually distorting reality, stretching people, places. You see, when you suffer a traumatic experience, one that you can't accept this part of yourself, the mind can hide or remove those memories. So he actually believes that the funeral was only two weeks ago, and that it was far his mother, not his sister. He believes that she is here, right now, in front of him. And he believes that he passed out last night and then suddenly woke up to this. This is just a distortion. It's all a projection. He didn't pass out last night. He blacked out six months ago. Now we've got two questions. What's he been doing for the last six months? - And who's Sean? - This piece of belongs to you, to your fucking family. I don't want anything more from you. You sick fuck! Well, what was it then? It was just a dream. You're okay. Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay. You're okay, Jay. - Is that the watch? This is family. This is family. Our family. Come on, make a wish. - Aloud, please. I wanna hear it. - No, it doesn't work that way. Think of something. Something you really want. - Ready? Do it. - Okay. I have something for you, Jay. Something really special. I'm gonna go get it. I'll be right back. - How do you feel, Jay? I know it's been a difficult summer, and this change is tough for you, but everything is gonna be okay. I promise You'll like the new school, and living in the city is great. It's a good thing. And we can see each other the whole time if you want. I know you don't get this now, but trust me, you need to hear this. You need to get away from mom, Jay. - Here's my present. For you. Go ahead and open it. You always used to ask me about this watch. Your father gave it to me. He made it. It was one of the first things that he made when he started the company. He made two, and he used to wear that one. And he used to always say, no matter where we go or where we are, it'll always be the same time for both of us from now on. It was his way of being close to me while he was traveling. And now, you're always gonna feel my presence, even when I'm not with you. Come on, put it on. Come on, put it on, Put it on. - Everything is gonna be okay. I promise. - I'm gonna die anyways, right? Just let me enjoy the time that I have left. - Do you remember me? She wouldn't let me see you for a long time. Your sister. Now that she is gone, we can finally finish what we started a long time ago. You must do something. You remember what happened, right? - It was a dream. It was just a dream. It was a dream. - Remember? Remember. Remember. - Relax. Five... Relax. Four... Remember. Three... Relax. Two... One... Zero. Remember. Deep sleep. What do you see? - When I got back from school... my mom wasn't home. She had already left for the weekend with this guy, her lover. I don't remember his name. I was supposed to take care of Jay. As soon as I entered the house, I knew there was something wrong. The chair was tilted over on its side, and the big mirror in the living room was broken. It was scary. - There were mirror stands everywhere. - It was happening again. - Sergeant, can you play Jay's 911 call again for me? - He's trying to do it again. I can't allow it. Not this time. I think I know how to stop him. This is wrong. Shut up! - Stop it there. Can you play that last part again? - There was a lot of blood. I tried not to be scared, not to panic. I remember thinking, I just want to protect my little brother. - I think I know to stop him. This is wrong. Shut up! - Stop. Did you hear anybody else's voice? He sounds like he's talking to somebody else, but I didn't hear anybody else's voice. - He was standing right in front of me. He was talking to someone. There was a tree, so I couldn't see who it was. I just kept moving. - And listen closely to the part right before that, where he says, "This is wrong." Play it again. - I got closer. I called his name. Jay, can you hear me? But he was somewhere else. Who are you talking to? Like when he used to have those dreams. He was standing there, staring into the distance. - This is wrong. Shut up! - And his voice... his voice was different. - This is wrong. Shut up! - His voice is different. - I don't follow you. - And he finally turned around. I will never forget that look on his face. It was as if he had never seen me before. - Listen to the tone of his voice. It's slightly different. - There was so much blood everywhere. - I think I know how to stop him. This is wrong. Shut up! - I got closer... and closer. And then I saw it. Roy... the dog... was there on the floor. He was dead. I couldn't move. - That is wrong. Shut up! - He's got a slightly different tone. Sounds like he's he's talking into the phone, but then... then it sounds a little more distant, like he's moved his head away from the phone, talking to somebody else in the room. It's like somebody else could have said those words before, even if it wasn't Jay himself. - There was nobody there. He was just staring at another broken mirror. - Come here. Touch it. Touch... it! - He wanted me to touch that mirror. So I did. - Detective... I think there's something you should know. - Who are you talking to? - I am a friend. His friend. - He was not Jay anymore. I asked his name. What's your name? And he said... Sean. - Sean. - My name... is Sean. - "My name is Sean." - I think I know who Sean is. I'm starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Jay is much more complex than I ever imagined. He is... someone special. I've never seen anything like this before. Jay is a man that is obsessed. He's constantly fighting against a barrage of disturbing thoughts. He might show a lack of emotion, apathy, loneliness. But he is... extremely tormented by something deep and obscure... in his mind. Whatever happened to him when he was a young child just destroyed his personality. Judie was the only thing keeping him together. Now that she's gone, he is suddenly experiencing everything that he's held back for so many years. - What has all this to do with Sean? - A lot. A lot. We need to... We need to understand what's going on in his mind before we go any further. It's important to recognize him suffering like loneliness or low self-esteem as potential risk factors for violence. And people like Jay can target their aggression towards themselves just as easily as somebody else. - That would explain why he was trying to kill himself. And the scars on his arms and face could be self-inflicted too. - It's possible, yes. Judie recognized that, when Jay was young, he had what we would call an imaginary friend. Imaginary friends can be something positive when you're young; it can help you deal with something that is an uncomfortable reality. But in other cases... they can become pathological... pushing you to do something very bad. - Like murder. - There's something else that you should know, detective. The intimate gathering where they spread Judie's ashes, I don't remember seeing Jay there with a man. As a matter of fact, I remember him being there with a woman. She was off to the side, smoking away from the people while he was talking to his mother. - So who's Sean then? Just another projection of his mind? - Probably, but we've gotta treat him like he's real, just like he is to Jay. What I'm saying, detective, is... I don't think Sean is just an imaginary friend. Not anymore. Somehow, in the last six months... he became Sean. - Can you do something for me? I know this is hard, but I want you to look at the body. - Why? - Please, Jay, tell me what you see. Jay, please. Do it for me. Tell me exactly what you see. - I see Sean. There's blood around him. He's laying there... on the floor. - Now look at the face. - Why are you doing this? - I am sorry. I really am. I know how important he was to you. He always was, right? I was there. I was there with you right by your side the whole time. Remember? - After mom's funeral, I started to remember everything that we've been through in the past. - After mom's funeral, I started thinking about everything that we've been through together in the past. - There was a moment when something, everything, changed. - There was a moment when everything changed. - I guess it might have been when we moved from the country house... - I guess it was when we left the country house... - To the city. - To move into the city. That night was the night of Jay's birthday. That night, my mom gave him the other watch. The one that my dad used to wear. - It was the night of your birthday. - It was the night of your birthday. Do you remember that? - Mom gave you that watch. - Mom gave you the watch. Remember? There's something about that night that... always stuck in my head. It never left me. - There was something about that night that I could never get out of my head. - There was something about that... - It always stuck with me. - Always stuck to my head. - Do you know what it was? - Do you know what it was? It was the look on his face. It was the look on your face. It was not just sadness. - It wasn't just sadness. - It wasn't just sadness or the move to the city. - It wasn't that we were moving to the city. - It wasn't the move to the city. It was something... - Something... - Something deeper. - Deeper. - Something deeper. Something... Something older. - Something... older. - Something older. Tah summer he was sick the whole time. - You had a fever for weeks. We couldn't get it under control. - And you were crying. You were crying so much. He was crying so much. And then, after that summer, I... I never saw him cry again. - Then I never saw you cry again. - And then, after that summer, I never saw you cry again. I remember sometimes thinking that... he probably had no tears left in his eyes. - Thought maybe that... - I used to think that... - You didn't have any more tears. - You probably had no more tears. He cried them all that summer. You cried them all that summer. I felt all of his pain just... I could feel all of you pain. Just by looking at him. And I wanted to carry it. - I wanted to carry that pain. - I wanted to carry that pain for you. - I wanted to carry that pain for him. I never asked him. I never asked him asked you, Jay. I never asked him what it was. - I never... I never asked what it was. What was it? - What was it? - You know, I felt somehow responsible. - I used to feel somehow responsible for not understanding what it was. - Don't, please. It had nothing to do with you, Judie. - I thought he must have been thinking about something that... that happened a long time ago. Something he couldn't remember. You were probably thinking about something that happened a long time ago. Something you had forgotten you just remembered that summer. That's probably what made you sick. - What are you trying to say? - I thought he realized... what he had done to Roy. - Do you remember Roy, Jay? - Do you remember Roy? - Roy. Mother's dog. Yeah. Why? - Do you remember what happened to him? - Yeah, he just left. - Are you sure about that? Think about it. - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Why are you asking about Roy now? About that dog? - Think about it, Jay. - Try to remember that weekend when mom came home. - Think about the day when mom came back from that weekend. - Remember the dinner that night? - Think about that dinner. - So, how was your weekend, sweeties? - Good. - Just good? - Yes, good. Nothing special. - Huh. Did she take care of you, baby? - Yes, I did. - Good. So I might go away again next weekend. So I'm wondering how long I have to wait before somebody tells me what happened to the mirror. - It was my fault. We were playing with the ball, and I was just clumsy. Don't pull your sleeves up, okay? - What happened to your face, baby? - You did that at school. You were playing soccer with your friends and you scratched yourself. Do you remember? You were at school, playing soccer with your friends, and you scratched yourself. It happened yesterday. He scratched himself at school, playing soccer with his friends. - Is that what happened? Are you okay baby? - It's just a scratch. - Where's Roy? - Where is Roy? I haven't seen him yet. - Did you see him today? - No. I didn't see him. When I got back from school, he wasn't here. - He was here this morning. - You guys remembered to close the back door before you left this morning, right? You know that Roy cannot be outside alone. Jay, did you close the door or not? I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I don't remember. - What do you mean you don't remember? It's a simple question. Did you close the door or not? Jay, did you close the door? - I don't know, Mom. I'm sorry. - Well, think about it. Think about it. How many times do I have to tell you to keep the back door closed? It's a simple thing. One simple thing. Is that so much to ask? - I did it. I did. - Did what? - When I was in the kitchen this morning, I heard something outside, so I went to the backyard to check. But it was nothing. - Nothing? - Yes, just... some birds. - Birds. - Yes, birds. But then I stayed there outside for a while. Maybe too long. I guess I was thinking about something else. - Something else? Like what? - School. Something I had to do for school. - Well, I hope you did it right! - I think so. I think I got it done. - Tomorrow, you're gonna go out and look for Roy, and you better find him. This was your responsibility, Judie. It's all your fault. - Yeah. Yeah, I remember. - What exactly do you remember? - Why do you wanna talk about that? - There's something that I need to know. - Judie, it was such a long time ago. It was it long time ago, Judie. I'm not mad at you. I'm not upset about him. - He replaced the actual event with the lie that Judie told to protect him. - Do you still think about it? It's not your fault. It just happened. You shouldn't blame yourself just because you left the front door open. He was just gone. - It's all your fault. - No, detective, you need to stop. - Hey. What did you say? - All of this bullshit. How did she do it? You know what, Jay? I think it's time to wake up. Judie, Judie, Judie. It's all Judie's fault. Judie didn't have a life because of you. Come on, Jay, wake up. - Please stop. - You know the truth. You know exactly what happened to that dog. You know the reason why you got sick that summer, don't you? You finally remembered what you did, and you couldn't take it, right? You couldn't take it. Judie was there all the time to protect you. But you never said a word, ever. - Not one word! - Judie. - Come on, Jay. Come on. Tell me. Tell me, and yourself, what you really did? - I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. - You killed your own dog? - No, He just left. - You held him in your arms while cutting his throat. - You're lying. - No, I didn't. - Did you do the same here, huh? - Isn't that what you did here, Jay? Isn't it? - No. Is that what you did? No. - Is that what you did? - Okay, this may be the moment. Ready for my orders. Go! - Stay away! Stay away from me! Back off! - Detective. Get back. Clear! - Damn Diana, what are you doing? Stop. Nobody shoot. Back off, back off, back off. - Judie! Come back here! Get her back here. - Did she follow the procedure? - Fuck off. - Officer, I need you to answer the question. Did she follow the procedure? Yes or no? - You know it's her fault you can't remember, right? Judie. She's the one that made you forget about me. That fucking bitch sent me away from you. But now that she's gone. We can finish what we started a long time ago. What are you talking about? Today's a very important day for us. We can finally fix this. There's just one thing I need you to do. And I've already prepared everything. What did you do? I called her while you were sleeping. I told her that we should meet. She's actually on her way here right now. No, I won't do it. Yes you will. You know exactly what to do when she gets here. There she is. - There was someone like him in your life, am I right? - It's Judie. - You see a lack of strength on Judie's part, but... maybe this is a distortion. Ask yourself if you're interpreting what Judie did in her life with your own experience. Maybe just can't see what Judie was really doing. - No, Dr. Rivers, I can't. What was it? - Love. Judie was one of the strongest people I'd ever met my whole career. She made a clear choice that she maintained her whole life. She chose to protect her little brother from the painful truth, and she died with Jay's secret. Isn't that love? - Or guilt. - Is that easier for you to relate to? That sense of guilt? Is that better for you? You have a lot more in common with Judie than you think. A lot more. You can use that. Use it. - It's happening again. You both need to see this. - Jay. Can you hear me, Jay? - What's going on? - Wait, don't touch him. - Why is he pointing the gun at that door? - He is not pointing the gun at the door. He's pointing the gun at himself. - Yeah, you're right. - What are you talking about? - I can see the both of us through that window. - Not following. - When we found him here frozen, pointing a gun to his head, he wasn't trying to kill himself. He wanted to kill Sean. - You're right. The mirrors. That's how he sees Sean. - It's not just the mirrors. It's the reflections. - Yes! Reflections! The reflected image of himself. - Why didn't he do it before? And why is he not pulling the trigger right now? - No, he's not gonna do that. - Why not? - Because right now he's not Jay. Right now he's Sean. - That's why Jay broke all the mirrors. He was trying to kill Sean. - If Jay wants to kill Sean, he has to avoid seeing him, or else he loses control. That's why he broke every reflective surface, to keep Sean far away from him. In order for Jay to kill Sean, he has to kill himself, because Sean is a part of him. But he didn't count... on that door window. - Okay? So what do we do now? - What is it? It's the light. It's the light. - Yes. - When they got on the scene, the sun must have been there, and it lit this window. Think about it. When the sun hits that window, if you are on the other side of it, you can see through it. But if you're on the side with the sunshine, you can't see the other side at all. And Jay was on this side. And in this situation- - The glass. It acts like a mirror. - Exactly. He could only see his reflection. - He broke every reflective image of himself in the house, but he didn't think it was gonna happen when he walked outside. - I remember when I got here, the sun was there, and it was cloudy, so it wasn't hitting that window anymore. - And that's why he woke up when he heard the sound of your voice, because he wasn't Seam anymore. - Exactly. - So what happened. - When the sun does not shine through that window, it's just a window. He couldn't see his reflected image anymore. He was Jay again. - So what now? - There's an overlap. I can see through the glass, but I can also see Jay and myself at the same time. - We need to find out where that light's coming from that's causing that reflection. - There's a street light over there. - No Uh-uh. It's gotta be closer to our side. - Detective, a few minutes ago that light turned on. - It must be an automatic light that switches on when the sun comes down. We must find the breakers for that light and turn it off. - I will take care of it. I found it. I am gonna switch it off. - Sean! Sean! Where are you? - Step back, detective. Don't touch him. Just gimme a minute here. - Sean! Sean, what did you say? - He's still asleep, he's still dreaming, but he's not Sean anymore. He's in between being awake and dreaming. Let's bring Judie in there, into his unconscious. I'll guide you through it. I just need you to remember to talk in a low tone, almost a whisper type of a tone. Follow my words, Jay... relax. - Jay, relax. - Don't be afraid. - Don't be afraid. - I'm here with you. - Judie! Where are you? I can't see you. - Relax. Don't be afraid. - Jay relax. I'm here with you. - Listen to me now. - Listen to me now. - I want you to close your eyes. - I want you to close your eyes. Trust me. Close your eyes. - You're sitting on a chair. - You are sitting on a chair. - And don't know where you are. - And you don't know where you are. - You can't move. You're tied up. - You're tied up. You try to break free, but you can't. Your body is bound. - Your body is bound. You can't even ask for help. - But you can't ask for help either. You have rope in your mouth too. You can't do anything. - But I found you, Jay. - But I have found you. - I'm in front of you. - I'm right in front of you now. - You can see me. - You can see me. open your eyes. Open them. - Open your eyes. Open them. I'm here for you. I'm here for you. I'm here to help. - I'm gonna take that rope out of your mouth so you can talk to me. - I'm coming closer. I'm touching the rope now. - I'm touching the rope now. - It's tight. - I know it's tight. - But I'm loosening the knots now. - Almost there. - Can you feel it? - Almost done? - You can feel that the rope's not so tight anymore. - Almost there. Here we go. Your mouth is free now. - Your mouth is free now. - Judie - Where are you, Jay? What do you see? - The dog. He's angry. He's always so angry. - Don't be afraid, Jay. - He's not mad at you. He's trying to tell you something. Something you need to remember. - Remember. - Jay, just look at him. - Look at him deeply in the eyes. - What do you feel? - What do you feel? - What's in my stomach? I can't move. It's dark, dirty. It's wrong. It's consuming me. - It's okay, Jay. It's okay. Don't be afraid. You're just feeling guilty for something you did, for something bad you did to that dog. - Remember? - Is it Roy? - What happened to Roy, Jay? - Roy didn't just leave us. - I didn't leave the door open, Jay. - Remember? What do you see now? - I see myself. I'm in the house. The country house. And I'm young Roy is there too. - What is he doing? - Eating. - What do you see now? - I'm in the kitchen. And that kid's there. - What kid? - The one I always see in my dreams. He wears a mask on his face, but only on the left side. - You know the kid, Jay. Think about it. Think about when you were young. - Jay, what do you see now? - Blood. - Jay... what do you see? - Did you see? - You did good, Jay. - Jay... talk to me. What did you see? - I remember now. I remember. It was me. - Know, it's hard to see. you did a terrible thing to that dog. There was a reason why you did it, Jay. - He told me to do it. That kid. This is what she deserved. - He said it was what she deserved? - Who? What did she deserve. - Your mother. She has to pay for what she did to me. - My mother. I don't know why he said that. - Who is he, Jay? Who is the kid? - A friend. But he had to go away. Because... Because of you. Because of you, Judie. You wanted him to leave. Told him to go away. I remember now. - Jay... now I want you to remember your birthday, the night of your birthday. - When we left the country house to go to the city. - We were in the car. - Remember. - What do you see now, Jay? - The watch. - Where are you. - In the car. You're there. You're young. Mom's driving. I see myself right there next to me. - You... cried a lot that summer. - You couldn't stop. - I remember. - Was it because you realized that you killed Roy? - No. It was something else. - What was it? - Something happened that I can't understand. I did something I wasn't supposed to. Something wrong. I don't know why. But I'm not a child anymore. I shouldn't have done it. - What did you do? - I can't see what it is, but it's still deep inside me... destroying my soul. Even if the memory's gone. - What are you thinking about? - This watch makes me feel dirty. Like my body doesn't exist anymore. I feel violated. - That night, my mom gave him the other watch, the one my dad used to wear. - Why do you think the watch makes you feel that way? - Jay. Jay. - Jay, talk to me. Who gave you that watch? - Why did you say that? - What? What did I say? I know you don't get it now. But trust me, you need to hear this. You need to get away from Mom, Jay. - You told me I should stay away from Mom. You told me to stay away from her. You wanted me to leave. - He made two watches that look alike. And now Jay had one... so my Mom could feel connected with him. Jay... Jay, I want you to close your eyes now. - What are you doing? - Trust me. - Oh, no, no, no. Detective. - Close your eyes. - Stop doing what you're doing right now. This is very dangerous. - You are sitting on a chair. You can't move. You're tied up. You're trying to break free, but you can't. Your body is bound. But you can't ask for help either. But I have found you. I'm right in front of you. You can see me. - Open your eyes. I'm going take these ropes off of you so you can finally move. I'm touching the rope now. Untying the not. You can feel that it's not so tight anymore. - I am almost done, Jay. Almost there. - Almost there, Jay. You're free. You can move now. I'm sorry. Please forgive me, Jay. I could have said something. I didn't though. I never did. It was her. That's why you killed Roy. You wanted to punish her for what she had done to you. That's why you felt violated and dirty. She seduced you. God, you were just a kid. You loved your mother, but there's another part that knew that it was wrong. There's another part in you that rejected it. Part of you even hated your mother for all of it. - No, it was that kid. It wasn't me. - You told me he was wearing a mask on the left side of his face, right? What about the other side? - The other side, he had... He had a scar. - Where did he have the scar? - Under his eye. - Under his right eye. - Yeah. - What else, Jay? - His arm. Roy hurt him. - Did he have dog bites on his arm? - Yeah. - Look at your arm, Jay. Look at it. That's your right arm. Your left arm, Jay. What do you see? - I don't understand. - And you have a cut under your left eye too. Jay... who is Sean? - How dare you... bring one of your sluts here? Do you have no respect for your sister? - You want a smoke? - Oh, no thanks. I don't smoke. - You don't have to be shy. You can go smoke if you want. - No, Jay. I don't smoke. I never did. - You know what she's like. - No. - Jay, seriously, how can I know that? - Do you know her? - No, I don't know her. She's just staring. - You've become distant, aggressive. Mean. - Goodbye, Jay. Take care of yourself. - Who the fuck was that? What kind of asshole are you to pretend you don't know me? - I only came here for one thing. This piece of shit belongs to you, to your fucking family! - And what about your Sean? Your boyfriend? - I don't want anything more from you, you sick fuck! - What about his arm? - They were cigarette burns. - Congrats. - How did he get those? - I don't know. - Was it on his right arm? - Yeah, the right arm. - Did he have a scar too? - Yeah, he did. - Under his right eye? - The right eye. - Jay, the kid... that kid that was in your house, that same kid from your dreams, Sean... you can't see the left side of face because you don't want to see it. You can't see what's under the mask because you don't want to. But it's time now, Jay. It's time for you to see... there is no mask. That's what you needed to see, Jay. - What are you talking about? - To protect yourself from what you are experiencing. To pretend that it wasn't happening to you. The kids' scar was your wound, but you saw it on the right side because of the mirrors. - Every time we're this room, I'm gonna call you Sean. - The mirrors, Jay. Your reflected image. You're looking at yourself, Jay. You... Are Sean. - No. It can't be true. It can't. If I'm Sean... who's in there? Who's in there? - Jay... do you know who I am? - Judie? Yeah, I know who you. - Where is Judie? - You're Judie! - Where's your sister, Jay? - Maybe it wasn't the best idea to introduce me at your sister's funeral. - What are you talking about? - Where is your mother? - My Mom? - Jay, look at me. Please, look at me. Look at me. - No, no. - Who has the other watch? You're wearing the watch right now, the same watch. And Sean is not here. There are two watches, remember? And that body on the floor... is wearing the same watch. If you are wearing one of them... who has the other one? - Who are you? - Diana. - My name is Diana. It's time to go, Jay. I'm going to take the gun from you now, okay? It's okay. It's okay. Nothing's happened. Nothing's happened. I just need to take the gun from you now, all right? - I know who I am. I know what I've done. I know what I'll see if I turn around. - So don't. Don't turn around, okay? We'll figure this out. We'll figure this out. You don't have to turn around. - He'll never leave me, Diana. - That's not true. That's not true. - I killed my own mother. How am I supposed to live with that? Can you imagine what it's like to look around and realize everything you see isn't actually there? - This thing that happened to you, it is not your fault. We can fix this. - Do you see that mirror? Can you fix that, Diana? Some things are too broken. You can try to put the pieces back together, but they're never gonna be the same. They're just gonna be fragments of something broken, trying to be whole. It's time to face the consequences. - Wait, Jay. Please don't Please, Jay, don't do it. Don't do this. Please. Listen, Sean... Sean will not let you do this. Please don't do this. - It's different this time. He can't control me anymore. Thank you for showing me the most important thing. The truth. I am Sean. - Did you try to stop him? Answer the question. Did you try to stop him? Did she follow the procedure? Officer, I need you to answer the question. Did she follow the procedure? Yes or no? - Yes. - She did everything that she could. - She did.
