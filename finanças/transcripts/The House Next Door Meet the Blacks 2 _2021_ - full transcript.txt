So, stick with me here. I know y'all came to see a comedy about the Blacks, everyone's favorite family with the perfect daughter that somehow survived Terror Night. You didn't sign up to see some Egyptians open an evil box and a bat flap his ass across an Indiana Jones map. Trust me, it'll all make sense later. Well, since we last met, Dad wrote a bestseller based on Terror Night. But then Dad and Cronut blew that money faster than a rapper at a strip club. We're back in Atlanta. And Dad's writin' the sequel, and we were just getting used to being back home when this very bat flew into our lives. Seriously, pray for us, y'all. We're back on the GGN News Network. I'm your host with the most, Finding Nemo, aka Nemo Hoser. Today on my show, I got a very special guest, the one and only, the author Carl Black in the motherfucking house. Mr. Black, what's happening? Snoop! How are you, man? I'm good, Carl. How you doin' today, brother? I'm excited, man. I got this new book coming out. It's called Terror Night. Mm. I wrote it. It's from my heart. This is my baby. What makes this book a great read for the average nigga sitting at home doing nothing? You know, most Black people know about terror. Mr. Black, I'm forced to tell you the truth. It is an easy read. Real easy. What you mean by that? "There was a Black man that..." That's bullshit, Snoop. Go get my book. It's called Terror Night. All right. All right. All right. That's enough Terror Night. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Now we got a real guest coming up on the show. Make some noise for the one and only Matt Barnes. Snoop, what's going on, man? Thanks for having me. Matt! - Who's that? - Terror Night. - Ah, this is Carl Black. - This book is j... Carl Black, man. You know me. I wrote Terror Night. - You read that book? - The book is crazy. You're gonna love it, man. And... That book was terrible. One of the worst books I ever read. You must be havin' a bad day today. It's a good book, man. - Nah. It's just a bad book. - Hey, you should... - Fuck you. - Fuck you and that book. I'm gonna get the fucking fuck. That nigga's excited. Okay. Just don't. Here. Hey. Hey! Hey! What are you doin'? We're practicing for the Migos' tour. The streets need us. The streets don't need yo ass. And stop makin' all that damn noise. - Frickin' old guys! - And stop playing! Again from the top. Ready? I'm gonna kick your ass. Give me the phone! Cut if off! - Dad, come on. - Cut it off! I'm trying to write. You messed it up again! I bet... Go. Daddy, get out! - Out. - Hey! Girl, you better stop throwin' shit. - Go! Shut up! - I peed in that bed last night. You know, I didn't escape the Purge so somebody would be breakin' in my fuckin' house! Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Man, come on, bro. - What's wrong with you? - Come on, bro. - Goddamn! - What's wrong with you? Goddamn. Why are you so jumpy? Yeah, 'cause maybe somebody tried to break in my house and kill me before. What you doin' creepin' around my house this late at night? The lights in the RV went out. I had to get some flashlights. - Some flashlights? - Not just flashlight. Purge lights! You feel me? You know about these. Did I tell you about 'em? You don't need no battery. That means you crank it right up. - Just like this. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, man. - What? What? - Hey, hey. Get rid of that janky shit! Stop orderin' it. Y'all run around here ballin' and spendin' money, leavin' the lights on, runnin' water, like there's money growin' on the tree. - I don't have no more money. - 'Cause you ain't selling no goddamn books. If you sell some goddamn books, we can goddamn sell these bitches. - And why're you broke? Huh? - Get your ass out of here. Hey, man. What the fuck, man? Stop holding me like a side bitch. - What's you tripping off of? - This is the reason right here. 'Cause I can't imagine why I let you talk me into spending my money on this shit. It's all part of the business plan, cuz. No, no, no. The business plan is the reason why Lorena is out busting her ass to wipe my old ass. Don't nobody want to hear about me moving back into my old neighborhood while my cousin livin' in an RV in the back of my house. What the fuck is going on over there, man? Some crackheads. Next door at the old Marsten house. They must be squattin' or somethin'. - Don't forget the... - Nah. They live there. I seen 'em move in, but the crazy part is all the windows are boarded. They only come out at nighttime. Yeah. Who would move in a place with a house that's boarded up like that? And when did they move in? Yeah. They got in like a week ago. - What the fuck? - Snitch, Snitch, - where you at? - Yeah. I watched 'em do it. They moved in, man. I see everything. I know you with the neighborhood watch and everything, but man... it's getting a little creepy, man. All right, ladies, in we go. Your coupe is here. - Did you hear that? - Shhh... That's some crazy shit. Somethin' strange goin' on in that house. I'm gone. You will be mine... unconditionally. Baby, I think some new people just moved in next door. Oh, baby. Leave those people alone, babe. Go back to sleep. This refrigerator's filthy! - Appreciate shit. - Ahem. What are you doing here, Cronut? I had to get some milk for my cereal. I ran out in the RV. The door's locked for a reason. Who messed up that damn toilet? Hey, what the fuck you doin' in here? Eating breakfast. What it look like I'm doin'? You ain't supposed to be here in the mornings. You told me I could come in on Tuesdays. I'm about sick of your shit. It's light wheat. Stay out of the toilet. You know there's a serial killer living next door. God, this boy run his damn mouth too much. Hey, Carl, Carl. Check this shit out, bro. ...the death of Chante Webster. Her badly mutilated corpse was found inside a dumpster behind Gus's Chicken and Waffles on Indian Hill Road. They found that body right around the corner. This is the sixth incident in a vicious string of kidnapping and murders, all of which were either African-American or Mexican. Racially motivated? Perhaps. This is exactly why we need to move out of this neighborhood. - Move? Again? - Yes, move. And when we say "move," - that means us. - Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Uh, hey... hey. No thinkin' for you, okay? What about what we saw last night? Okay, I don't have time for this, Carl. I got to go to work. I'm going to be working a double tonight, so you're on your own for dinner. What about what we seen with the neighbors, bro? You better do what she say. Fuck you up. She payin' the bills around here. Hey, babe. Don't pay no attention to Cronut. He's just a dumbass. He's a neglected Chihuahua. Carl, I'm not happy here. - Listen... - This was supposed to be temporary, Carl. We were supposed to be here until you got - your money going. - Money. - You wrote your book. - It's gonna work. That developer came around again other day. He can make us a really good offer on your mom's house. We can move to a safer place. I can be happy. Happy wife, happy what? - Happy wife. - Happy life. The guy's a fuckin' vulture. Okay? He wants to move in this neighborhood so he can take it over and turn it into a fuckin' strip mall. Do you understand what I'm sayin'? Okay? It's called... it's called gingivitis. Gentrification! Shut up, Cronut! Stupid dumbass nigga. Once we move out of here, who cares what they do to the neighborhood? Just promise me that today you're going to look at this and consider it. I'm... I'm gonna think about it. I appreciate it. Up next, I survived a hammer to the head and a boot to the face. Somethin' fucked-up went down in that house last night. You think that was a dead body? Would you stop? It's already hard enough you got all this crazy shit in my wife's head. And no! I did not see a body. I think my first instinct is like, there's dead body in there. But... Oh, there's a nice one over there. No. Hey, hey, hey! No! Why you cock-blocking? She need me. This could be my old lady, man. - She's already married. - You know I've been in the penitentiary. - Let me just live, brother. - Okay. You've been to prison two years ago for 10 days for drinkin' and drivin'. And you're a "gangster drinker." I'm just gonna go over there and just... just rap a tad to her. - I'm gonna go. What's up, baby? - Cronut. He about to shoot that midget sperm in that girl. Bunny! Shit. Baby, I told you, you got to get a new wheelchair. - You got new wheelchair money? - Ugh! - I'm sorry, Bunny. - It's okay. I didn't mean to snap at you. If my penis worked, I'd make love to you right now. - I'd hit it from the back. - I know you would. Marky Mark style from Boogie Nights. Hey! Stay off my property! What's up, Clive? Shouldn't you be makin' up some bullshit or whatever else you do you call work? You know my husband don't like you guys comin' over here. But I like seein' you guys. What you been up to? You been rollin' around this neighborhood or you just being kickin' it around? - Funny, motherfucker! - Kickin' it! What are you doing, writin' your next bestseller? Who're you trying to be? New Alex Haley? Steve Harvey? You gonna try to make a book into a movie? You see Think Like a Man? Think Like a Man 2? Sucked! Pootie Tang blew those two out the water. Okay, yeah, I'm writin' a book. When is your next marathon, huh? You gonna help me tend to my garden? I'll tend the shit out of that garden. Tend more than the garden. I will bend you over in there. I mean... So, I have carrots. I got a carrot. With a fat head. What's up with that house right there? What's up with them people that live in there? I know you can't see with them thick-ass glasses. You know what these eyes have seen? Yeah, these nuts. I've been in three wars. - How you think I got Bunny? - The government. That little check you get every month, she's takin' it. - I saw into her soul. - Damn. I see that little man right there with the 8th-grade body talkin' to my wife. You don't think I see that? I saw you catch gonorrhea, baby... You better watch your fuckin' mouth! - Watch your mouth, man! - I wish you would. I wish you... I've been waiting on this. Why would you kick me in the leg - where I can't feel it? - I know you can't... can't feel it. Come on. You ain't the first Black guy I got in a fight with. I can't feel my legs, Carl. Hit me in the face. You little bitch. All day, every day. Listen, man. Somethin' ain't right at that house, Carl. They moved in the middle of night. There's never any movement during the day. - Yeah. - Lazy shits won't answer the door, had a package dropped off. Mailman brought it over to me, sittin' on the front porch right now. Hey, Bunny! Come get that package from Africa! Hey, Bunny! Get that package over there on the back porch. - I wouldn't. I wouldn't. - You might get on... - You feel that, Carl? - Okay. Let my arm go. - Let my arm go. - Let my cousin... aw! - It fucking hurts. - Hey. Let it go! That shit hurt. Dang, you got some upper body strength. There it is. Look at that... Africa. Africa. Wrapped in velvet. I'm gonna take it over there myself. Cronut... Cronut! Why you give him the fuckin' package?! It's like we're living across the street from Diff'rent Strokes. - Hey, hey, hey. Give me the package, man. - What the shit? Cronut! See? You happy?

Can you tell me what happened with Allie? - She called you? - She's mad because you don't trust her. No. She had her little boy in my house. She ain't paying no rent up in here. You need to be the bigger man and call her and apologize, because I'm not dealing with all of this mess. And speaking of which, did you call the real estate agent like I asked you to? Oh, man.

I'm trying to write a new book. Yeah. You see, the first one was good. - Yeah. The second one. - Now, I'm trying to do... - I'm trying to do the second one. - Gotta be off the chain. It's a fine piece of literature. The shit was a modern-day classic. Dr. Mamuwalde. What type of medicine you practice, bro? I practice the type of medicine for those with a particular affliction. Take two of these and call me in the morning. Oh, this. Bless his name. I knew you was a pimp. - Ha. Such harsh language, Mr. Black. - Yeah.

We ain't doing no provocative nothin' around here. This is my daughter. Ain't nothin' going up in there but a tampon. - Daddy! - Mr. Black, I assure you, I may be a pimp, but I am no monster. Matter of fact, to prove my point, allow me. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. This is for your education. Really? - No. - Ooh. Daddy! No!

I'm movin' the fuck out of this house. This our house! We can't let him move us out. - I don't wannna hear that shit. - I gotta tell you this for real. Guess what I found while you was talking to the pimp vampire? These Rico glasses, man. They probably got him. They done... they done drunk all his blood and everything, man. Stop! That motherfucker just tried to play me. He's going to jail. Three hots and a cot, he's going to jail. So, what you gonna do about it? The little motherfucker's going to jail for pimping and pandering around here. What you mean, what I'm gonna do? Police ain't never arrestin' no goddamn vampire. That's shit, okay? Did you see he floated down the stairs? You didn't see him float? 911, what's your emergency? Yes, I have a problem here. Um, I'm a new neighbor that just moved in the neighborhood. As you can tell, I'm Caucasian. And there's a real peculiar guy. - Is he Black? Okay. - Yes, he's Black. We'll send over five units right away. Okay, you'll be here in a second? - Right away. - Thank you. That's how you do that. He's going to jail. Hey, hey, hey, hey, fall back, fall back. - What's going on? - I'm the lead cop on this. - Laced, you're a rookie. - Listen, I'm just tryin' to have some fun. I said fall back, man. Listen, I got my gun. I'm going to this house to have some fun. Do my thing. All right. Go ahead. Handle this. What kind of spooky shit is this? First time bein' a cop. This is gonna be a breeze. That like a old couple relationship. Come on out of there - before I put a hot one in your ass! - Hold on. There'll be no gun violence. Put your gun down. This is my first day. Shut up and stop being a little bitch. Two of them in up there, weird as hell. Lock his ass up. He got Rico. - Police. - Good heavens! What is all the fuss? Oh, a father and son team, splendid. What may I do for you, dark-skinned Hutch? Listen, big fella. Dude down there saying y'all been involved in the kidnappin' of the neighborhood watch captain? Rico. - So y'all kidnap him? - Yeah. And I heard you got hoes all up in through there. Y'all freaky-freaky, huh? Not at all, sir. This is the residence of Dr. Mamuwalde. - Mama-who? - Can't a man pimp in peace? The name is Dr. Mamuwalde. - Shit. - He trippin'-trippin'. I hope they get his ass, man. Listen, big fella, do you mind if I have a look inside, see what's going on see what I can steal? I mean, just see what's going on in the house. Absolutely. My house is your house, officer. Feel free to look around - as soon as you present your warrant. - He trippin'. - Warrant? - Yes, warrant. What the fuck? You 'posed to be an expert on the law now? I'm gonna show you what we do with experts down here, hm? Hold on, what you doing? No! Put the taser off! Put the taser off! - You trippin'-trippin'. - Uh-huh, bust him. Bust him. - Put your taser off. - Don't eyeball me, boy. Don't play with me. We just want to know if you know about the whereabouts of this Rico guy. Where is Rico? You're the one supposed to be looking for whoever you're looking for, sir. I don't know who Rico is and you can't make me. He's lying, man. How y'all gonna believe somebody dressed like Dr. Seuss is what I'm sayin'? What do you do, sir? For a living? Well, for a living, I take fantasy and dreams and I make them into reality. Let me tell you something, creepy motherfucker. You got two options. Option A, we look around inside this spooky motherfucker, or option B, we're gonna arrest your ass, take you down to the precinct, ask you a bunch of goddamn questions. He's going to jail. That's what I'm talking about. I'll take... I haven't even chosen my options. Oh, we're gonna do it. We're gonna take him now. Option A, I don't. Option B... We're gonna take you downtown, Midnite. Wait a minute. How can you call me "midnight" as dark as you are... - What? What did you say? - ...ith all due respect, officer? Well, if I'm Midnight, aren't you two Nights? There ain't shit you're gonna do about it. Come on with your little... - Stop resisting. - They're taking him to jail. That's what I'm talking about. Do your job. This is definitely Black on Black crime. Hey, I got it. Take his Black ass down. Officer! I believe there's been a misunderstanding. Do you mean this Rico? Rico, what the fuck you doing in there? I'm fine. I was just in the basement... They didn't fondle with you down there, did they? They did me fine. - They served me fresh bananas. - From Honduras. Bananas in the basement? They done brainwashed his crazy ass. They did more than brainwashing. Somethin' ain't right with him. Come to me, Lorena. Come to me, Lorena. I've been searching for you. Are you feeling my breath upon your corpuscle? What kind of cop shit is this? Y'all let him go? Mr. Black, you call us down here again and waste our damn time, I'm gonna take your ashy ass to jail. We cop cops. This ain't no damn joke! Man, if you don't get your retarded ass... You better watch your mouth, before I stick these goddamn handcuffs up your ass. Don't eyeball me, boy. Let's go. Carl, why are you here with the police? What did the neighbor do to you? This is what happens when you keep messing with the neighbors. Why are you blamin' him for everything? Because clearly, I see you out here too. For real, this is your plan. Don't try to put this on me. - We're movin' out. - What do you mean? Wait! - Without you. - How you gonna move out without me? - We family. - No. We not family. You're just my cousin that fucks up everything. - That's family. - You know what? I'm tired of you always blamin' him. Look right here. This is what it's about, me and you. You're messing up. - Babe. I can explain. - You should be ashamed of yourself. The motherfucker was trying to disrespect me in front of my daughter. I'm tired of you embarrassing our family. You owe that man an apology. Babe... I don't know if this is it for us. I used to think it was the house, the neighborhood, your book. But it's not. It's you. It's you and I that don't work. I got to go back to work. So you figure that out. I'll apologize. I'll go apologize. I don't have a problem apologizing to him. Attack and bring me my wife. Right this way, Mr. Black. The good doctor'll be here to deal with you shortly. Hey, man. Did you just change your accent? Where'd he go? What the fuck was he saying? Wow. It's nice, though. - Carl Black. - Hey! What the fuck! Jesus, Buddha, Allah! Is every place in here creepy? I thought I smelled failure in here. And I thought I smelled Celine Dion's wig also in here. You're a funny motherfucker, Carl. And I don't just mean that dumb expression on your face. Yeah? Well, look, let me be straight up with you, all right? - Thank you. - I don't like you. First time I seen you, - just didn't like you. - Okay. My wife sent me over here to apologize to you and that's what I want to do. I want to apologize, but I just want to let you know, I don't give a fuck. We getting the fuck out of this neighborhood. Well, that's very interesting, Green Lantern, but you can't leave just yet. Oh, yes, I can! Shit! My lease is up next month. What's this? There's something I want from you and you're not leaving until I get it. Man, I hope it's my nuts for these girls. No! My book. You like my book? I told you I was a fan of your book. - That is crazy. - It was magnificent. You like my book. I like you and your family, Carl. And not everybody in my family agreed with you moving in next door to us. Your wife. My wife? Lorena? Lorena. Oh, no. She ain't... she ain't into no pimping shit. She ain't into no pimping shit and I ain't either, okay? Tried it, didn't like it. And my daughter? That's off limits. You're too grown to be messing with anybody's daughter. Ain't no man gonna let you mess with they daughter. She's still a little girl. She's still doing Juicy Juices. She's not a grown lady. She don't know what YAK is, nor does she know what Gray Goose is. I had no idea how old she was. She was my size. Keep your little one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve fingers away from my daughter, blah-blah. Big mistake. Don't fuck with my daughter. And Cronut, he's a character. Oh, Cronut? You can have him. Ugh. No one wants Cronut. You can fuck him if you want. He's crazy. He's the one that think Michael Jackson and Biggie and Tupac is still living, and-and thinks O.J. didn't do it. He's got a whole lot of shit in his head. And he gave me some crazy theories about you too. I'mma go ahead and sign this autograph 'fore I can get on out of here. And what was his theory about me? We still don't know why you moved in the neighborhood... What the fuck! What's wrong with you? Egad, Carl Black. Do I detect hostility in your voice? I thought we were cool now. No, we're not cool! And you do detect hostility in my voice. You got a picture of my wife naked on your fucking wall! I ain't even got a picture of this bitch. - Did you photoshop the picture? - No. No, that's her. I bet I know what Cronut thinks about me. You know what? He was right. What are you doing? Be quiet. I know what I'm doing. Would you... Dad, come on. Son, I got something I need to talk to you about. All right. We got a vampire living next door! I've seen him! - Hey, that's cool! - I think I've seen that dude. What's so... What the fuck is wrong... What's cool about that? Dad, Dad, just relax. Just call the cops. I can't call the cops. Okay, everybody knows the vampire rules. Like, a vampire cannot come in your house unless you invite him in. Did you invite him in? - No. I didn't invite him in. - All right. All right, then you're good. That's good. - I'm cool. Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on now. Everybody knows that. It's in literally every vampire comic book. Every one. Oh, man. You got some weed? Dad, what? Just leave. Just leave. I know who got it. No, he doesn't. He's kidding. Bro, shut up. - A dime bag? Twenty? - No, no. Leave. Leave. He's kidding. He's kidding. He's kidding. Go take a nap. - But I do. - Just be quiet. Just stop. I'm gonna watch you all night, motherfucker. Don't invite him in. Oh, shit. Give me your money. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt... Hi, Carl. No. No. I'm being serious. I'm telling you, it's been an interesting week and I apologize. I feel the timing of it all is pretty, um, special, that you would... I don't know where you came from, but I appreciate it. And I think it's important that we met tonight because I wanted to really apologize for the other night. I know my husband was in there tonight. Is everything okay? Mamuwalde, right? I have to, um, really get this out, because I feel like I'm having a little bit of an out-of-body experience, because I typically don't invite complete strangers into my house to have a glass of wine. In this case... Don't invite him in. - Hey. - Thank you. I appreciate that. What you doing? Baby, hi. Hi. Were you sleeping? What is he doing here? He's not supposed to be here. Where are your manners, baby? This is Dr. Mamuwalde. - Our neighbor from earlier... - I know what you doing! Yes, where are your manners, baby? He's not supposed to be in this house. I invited him to have a glass of wine with me because if anything, we owe him a thank you. - I don't wanna hear all that. - If it wasn't for our neighbor, I would have gotten mugged tonight. You got mugged? He swooped... Where did you come from? Where? How did you get there? - Swooped. - What happened? Fortunately for you, I happened to be in the area looking for a late-night snack and happened to stumble upon your tastiness. He's not supposed to be in our home. He was not invited by no one. Under ordinary circumstances, Carl Black here would be right, - but I was invited, Carl. - You know the rules. - His kind is not invited in our house. - Listen... - My kind? - Yeah. That is a racist statement, Negro. I'll have you know, in this age of divisiveness and bigotry, we can't do this to each other. Sheesh! Yes. Baby, listen, please just calm down. We got a real live vampire in my house and you're telling me to calm down? If I had a wife as fine as yours, I'd never let her out of my sight. Hey, man! What-what-what you doing? You can't do that, man. What the fuck! What if I grab your hair, man? Do not... touch my hair, Carl Black. You got two Bo Derek braids hanging on both sides of your face and you gon' touch on my girl's shit. Baby, just calm down, okay? Okay, that's enough. That's enough. - Oh, I'm sorry. - What are you doing, Carl? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - Ouch! - You know I'm clumsy a little bit. That looks exquisitely painful. Ah-ah-ah. Go in there and rinse your arm off. - I got it, Carl. I got it. - Yeah, you cut your hand 'cause you're standing up there reckless eyeballing. I got it. Dr. Mamuwalde, it was really, really nice to meet you. - Well, go wash your hand, baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm... Put a band-aid on it. O-positive we'll see each other again. Listen, you little neglected Harry Potter cast member, let me tell you something. That's my princess, and that's my wife, and I love her. You're not going to destroy my family! What do you intend to do about it, Carl Black? Install my cable, motherfucker? Nah. I'm gonna pimp-slap the shit out of your ass, motherfucker! Damn, you're strong! Let me tell you a little story. I've been looking for Lorena for centuries. I first laid eyes on that fine young thing in the Caribbean. Lost her, found her again. I've seen all types of women in all shapes and sizes, but none compare to the governor's daughter. We were in love and I was finally going to make her mine. You were warned, vampire. Tonight's the night that I send your soul to hell! Demon! Come, woman. No. No. No! They took the love of my life from me and I have been looking for my Puerto Rican princess ever since. Go to hell, vampire. They took my life. Man, that was a cool story! But the real fact is, is that's my wife, and I love her. And you're not gonna destroy my family. You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself. What the fuck? She will be mine. No, no! Mine... Carl Black! The authorities are still in shambles as they scurry about for clues - in the murders of these prostitutes. - Wow. If anyone out there has any information or any leads... - Damn. - ...feel free to DM me personally at jack... Hey, babe. Hey, hey. - How's your arm? - It's better. It's feeling good. - I gotta go to work. What? - No! - Why you gotta go to work? - Because you put me in this situation. I got to go to work to pay the bills. Let me pay you for the night. You can't afford me for the night. - Listen, I love you. - I know. I-I just want to get you guys out of this neighborhood. Okay. Wait, wait, call me crazy. I-I'm just throwing this out there. I'm having second thoughts about selling the house. - What? - I don't know, ever since I met the neighbor last night, - the way that he was helping me or the way that he... - Hey, hey. - No, but maybe it's not such a bad neighborhood, babe. - No, no, no, no, no. No! - Wait, wait. He's a nice guy. - Baby, listen. No! That... no. He's not no fucking nice... what did I tell you about liking people? - Liking? - You always liking somebody. - No! Hey! - He saved me. Relax. Let's put this to rest until I come home from work tonight, okay? And we can talk about it then. - I got something I want to tell you. - What? The next-door neighbor... - Yeah? - He's a vampire. A vampire. - He's a fucking vampire. - Okay. A vampire. You're crazy. You're just jealous. Cronut, let me in. There's a vampire living next door. Cronut? Eww. What's wrong with you? Die, vampire! - Die, vampire! Die! - Let me go. Let me go. Let me go! Get up off of me, man. Fuck you doing in my house all uninvited? I didn't invite you in here. Why you sneaking up on me like that? Why am I sneaking up on you? This is my house! Fuck you doing up in my house? I thought you won't fuck with me no more. Whoa. Why you got them damn glasses on? Why you care? You don't like 'em? They don't go with my 'fit? - No. - What... what you want? Shit. I, well, I just... Hey, man, look. All right. You was right. We do have a creature living next door to us. It's a real vampire, man. I seen his teeth! I thought you was lying at first, but he's real. And he already got Allie, and I don't want him to get my wife! And? And that's about the closest to an apology you gon' get. I've been doing my research and what I came up with? That house right over there? It's a master vampire over there, and that's the nest. And we should kill him. - What? - We should kill him. We, we. That's French. We? Yes, it is we. Ain't no I in us. It's we. Me and you. We family. Yeah. Whatever. We should kill that motherfucker. Let's bury him in the ground, man. Just leave his head out and just kick him in the head all day. Check this out. What's my name? - Cronut. - No, what's my real name? - Man, look, man. Stop playing. - Mr. what? - Mister? - Mr. Right. Mr. Right. You want to get rid of the vampire? - Yeah. - Trust me. I made a call. - Who is that? Is that Barack Obama? - Trust me. Not quite, but close. Oooh. Oh. Did you see that African booty scratcher come out of there? - Yes. - No! - Yes. - Why'd you call him? - Just trust me. - Oh, man. - Have I ever let you down? - Yeah, a million times. Don't worry about that. That don't count. - Oh, man. Look how he dressed. - It looks crazy. - Don't worry about it. - Whoopi Goldberg. - You smell a vampire? - Not yet, wait. Right now, I smell fear. - Fear? - And I smell broke-ass-ness coming from this direction. - Broke-ass-ness? - No, you smell your bottom lip. Last but not least, I smell... two bitch-ass niggas. That's why you called me to save you like I did the Purge. Saved me? You ain't saved me from nothin'! You better take your Black ass off. - Punk bitch nigga, you owe me money! - I don't owe you nothin'. You little dick bitch. You pee on your boss. - Fuck you too. - I hope your wife get pregnant again and I hope the baby is not yours. You kiss my ass! Your mother, your grandfather, your uncles are all the same nigga. I know you work for that cab company. You need to get back in there and drive that cab, so... - Carl Black, you owe me money! - Hey, hey, hey. Calm down, calm down. I got it. I got it, calm down. - This nigga is pissing me off. - If you calm down a little - for a second. Look... - Don't you hit my head. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look, I promised him I'd show him some crazy spooky shit if I recorded it and put it on his live TV show. - On YouTube? - Yeah. - You ain't got no followers. - He's popular. Five hundred thousand subscribers. I got a live vampire livin' next door to me. That's what I got. Nigga, that's why I'm here. - That's why I brought these! - Hey, hey! Put your leftovers down, man. You must listen to me because I am a vampire slayer. The vampires are very dangerous. They will kill you. He will suck your blood. He could be after your wife. You have a wife. I know that. I've seen her. She have a nice ass. No disrespect. Tell me about these niggas, please. What did he look like? He's bite-size, he's real short. How short is he? He's short. He's... he's, you know, he's... Between you and this nigga, where is he? Like this way? This way? That way? Under the table? - Pocket size. - Pocket size nigga? He got like a little perm. He looked like that little man on the dime. - What dime? - The dime. - The dime, motherfucker. The dime. - Dime. Ten cents. Ten cents a day, like what you eat. Shut the fuck up, little bitch nigga. Fuck you. If I had a choice between the vampires, the devil and Donald Trump, I would take Donald Trump. The question is now he's trying to take your family away, - what are you are gonna do? - Hey, hey, hey! We're not the vampire. You don't have to keep putting that on us. Don't be a bitch! If I want to talk to a little nigga, I go to Chuck E. Cheese. Either you gon' help me, or you gon' help me, somebody's gonna help me or I'm going up in there with a wooden thing - and I'm gonna stab him in the... - Mm. I'm telling you! You know how... I'm going up in there and... Hey! - You guys are crazier'n shit! - Who the fuck is that? Carl Black, I'm all you have. You must save your wife before it's too late. Fellas, listen to me. The vampire is very tricky and old. It has survived many centuries because he's smart. Much smarter than your stupid ignorant ass, Carl Black. That insidious bastard is a master vampire. A master vampire? He's not to be played with. That means he has companions. - Companions? - We have a lot more to deal with. You have to get to know your enemy. I thought I knew him. And how about his crew? Do you know them? His crew? What? The butler? Butler?! That's not a butler! That's his ghoul! What is a ghoul? This is not the time to be a bitch, Carl Black. A ghoul is very dangerous. - What about those fine-ass girls he had in there? - Yeah. They was fine. - Cronut! - I liked them. Those are not average fine-ass girls. Those are his bodyguards. They are murderous. What? The more beautiful they are, the more dangerous. This is getting more serious than I imagined. What's this shit? It was addressed to him. He got a little chain on. He got your same facial structure... Don't be a dick face. Give me that. It is nothing. Just some stupid fucking doll. - Put it away. - Are you sure? How we going to kill this motherfucker? - Dad. Dad. I got an idea. - What? I turned the Purge bats into stakes. If you stab a vampire with it, it'll die. Shut up! This is why I'm here. We have to kill the vampire! Why you wipe my kisses off like that? Baby, because you put too much lip gloss on. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do, and then my shit - be all glittery for the rest of the day. - Shut up. I do it for you - when I'm around you. Whatever. - Use Chapstick. - You cute. You fine and all, baby. - Whatever. Give me a little bit of head now. - What? - I'm just saying, like, I wanna get a little bit of head... We're in front of my parents' house. Are you serious? Baby, they're sleeping a little bit. - Babe. - Come on, baby. - Just a little bit of head. - Stop playing all the time. - Baby, my-my legs. I'm-I'm paralyzed. - Stop. That's the least you could do, community service. Let me get a little bit of community head. Shut up. We need to talk. Talk about what? Baby, look, talk with my dick in your mouth a little bit. - I don't mean to be disrespectful. - Wait, wait. Listen. Listen to what? - Baby. - Did you hear that? The only thing you need to listen to is... Listen! The fuck was that? Shit! Oh, shit! - What is that? - Ooh. Oh, my God. Freezee! Freezee! That was Allie. Time to get the fuck out. What just happened? I don't know. I just heard screams, man. He made the first move. He has taken your daughter. It's all fucked up, man. I didn't know they had Allie, too. I like Allie! But there's more. - Well, tell us more. - Yeah, you better say something - before we take your banana bike, nigga. - Come on now. The vampires, man, they got me. See that house next door? They havin' a big-ass vampire party up there, man. Dracula kind of blushin'. They said when it's over, they gonna kill everybody. - Oh, God. - Shit. Things all fucked up around here, man. Not me. They ain't gonna get me. They ain't gonna get me! Come back here! Fuck that! I'm a real snitch! Those vampires done bit me. Did you hear that? Yeah, you saw how he took off? This is exactly what the monster wants. He wants you to attack him at night, when he's strongest. Don't fall for it. What am I supposed to do? I got a wife and a daughter over there. Just wait till the daytime, when he's weak. - And then we kill him. - No, no, no, no. If you wait till the morning, Lorena and Allie will be vampires. - Oh. - Junior, I love you to death. They already got your sister in there. They're trying to get your mama. This is a good neighborhood and I'm here to protect it, because I'm Carl Black. And I'm Cronut. We ride together, we die together! Go lock up the house. We need the right weapons to kill this vampire. - I made a phone call. - Who you call? - Mr. Saturday Night. - What? He knows everything about killing vampires. Saturday Night? I met him last Friday at Fat Tuesday's. Let's go. It's war. Friends, let me do all the talking. I've seen this guy kill lots of people. Don't do no bitch shit now. Let's go. He's the only one to kill vampires. He'll give us all the weapons. Just stay calm. I believe in God, first and foremost. So we huntin' vampires. - I'm scared. - What you scared of? He looks like The Undertaker. I may not have what you want, but I got just what you need. Holy shit. - You ain't playin'. - No, he's not. - Damn! - You're gonna like this. Whoa. - Oh, that's cool. I like that. - That's alkaline water. Alkaline? It's holy water! Joel Osteen holy water. It kind got a pineapple taste to it. Since we have vampires, I got us some UV sunlight. Hey, hey, hey. You're Black, motherfucker. It don't work as well. Nigga, I can't see now. They say short motherfuckers love to get freaky, so I brought this just for you. My boy. You know me, don't you? - Not really. - Is this real leather? - Not really. - I'm wearing this. Look at that. Look, look, look, look. When y'all really ready to take out some motherfuckers... Ooh. - This what I pull out. - Shit. - God is great. - All the time. If it ain't a Jesus. You got a calling, Carl.

That book was terrible. It's one of the worst books I ever read. Carl, I'm not happy here. I need the money, Dad. Just... just leave. Just leave. Go take a nap. This ain't the time for your goddamn book. I don't know if this is it for us. I used to think it was the house, the neighborhood, your book. You need to realize that family's the most important thing in life, not a book. - I'm moving out. - You're messing up. It's you and I that don't work. It's you. Come to me now.

Have you, Black Panther, Chloe, and Bow-Wow ever thought about becoming the new Black Ghostbusters? - Hunting ghosts? - Hunting ghosts? I mean... You don't have to answer that, Carl. It's a good idea. We could make money. Let's wait, let's wait. Don't be a bitch. Let's make this money, Carl. Yes. Don't be a bitch. Make the money. And what the fuck did you do? - Look at me. - We could make money, Carl. - Get the money, Carl. - Carl, let's do it. - I'm gonna make money. - Yeah. Why-why not? One more question. Handicapped white man, is it true that your first experience with vampires was in the jungle in Hanoi where your troop was ambushed, you were ravaged, and your legs were completely destroyed? Fuck you, Sammy Sosa. One thing I hate about this neighborhood... all the goddamn vampires. Well, we would just like to thank you for your service to this country and make... Oh, my Lord! His hands are strong, but his legs are dead. Come on. Come on. Let his hand. Let his hand. Get off me, Carl! Your wife's cheating on you! - What are you talking about? - What? - I see everything! - Shut up! - Cronut's gay. - No, I'm not. That don't count in jail. That's not even your daughter! - Uh-uh. - No. I'm sick of this. Yeah. I'm sick of you. Come on, Carl. Are you ready? Give me one second, baby. I'm coming. Lord knows I'm coming. I know you happy you ain't with Clive no more. - But what's taking you so long? - You're rushing me, babe. You ain't rush Clive. I know you waited for his ass. Just calm down. You gon' get this dick. Gonna drop some good dick on you. Well, hurry. - Oh. - Yeah. Yeah. You see it. You see it. Yeah. Say you're ready for me to draw some dick O's. Yeah. Yeah. Oh-oh. That's it? You're kidding. Wait.
