- Fuck you. - Fuck you. Dungeon boy fuckin' bitch faggot. Fag. We call you the fucking locker room dungeon boy bitch. Look at this fuckin' guy. Can we get this stuttering dungeon boy faggot over the toilet where he belongs. - Oh, yeah! - What'd you say? Take a drink. Go ahead there, Dungeon Boy. Come on you fucked up little fag. Who would've thought four students could entirely destroy the halls of Arcadia. The mess you've made is nothing short of amazing. Now, whatever plans you've had for the last week of summer break, consider those replaced. You're here to stay as punishment, repairing the damage you've done. You'll find everything you need to make this right in the boiler room. I'll be in my office, waiting for it to be over. I'd appreciate it if you didn't cause any more trouble than you already have. Now get to work, because none of us are leaving until it's all finished. No. No? No. Where's Gus? Gus was murdered. Someone snuck into his house, tied him to a chair in his basement and stabbed him four times with a kitchen knife. In the belly. That's messed up and everything but so what? Get a new janitor. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about, Louis, it won't get you out of this. Well how long is this gonna take? Stop asking questions and start fixing this, Mouse, unless you want Ammit to eat your rotten little heart. Get going, all of you. What a freak. Yeah, what was that she said about Gus? Didn't you hear, he got stabbed in the belly. Belly. That can't be true though, can it? Of course not, she's fuckin' with us. Yeah, and what was that shit about Ammit, why does he wanna eat my heart? Ammit's an Egyptian monster, and she's a girl. You know, in ancient Egypt when you died they would weigh your heart to see how heavy it was with wrongdoing, and then you know, if it was too heavy they would feed it to Ammit. Okay, all right, I call bullshit. It's not a real thing, idiot. And then they would feed you to her. Dude. Really? Really. The sooner we get done, the sooner we get done. And I don't know about you, but I don't wanna be stuck here forever. You're not doing this, are you? - Emily. - What? Are you gonna clean this? No. Well, I was gonna go class by class and I was thinking if you went with me we could get the same amount done because we'd be going twice as fast. Emily. What? Is there something wrong? Everything's fine. Okay. God, please stop. Louis? Louis? Louis! Louis! Boo! Bet she locked it. That bitch probably thinks we'll steal something. Check it. Scottie French don't get on his knees for nobody. So I think Emily's off her meds. Ya think? Louis would know for sure, right? Told her she should. Scottie. Mouse, she's miserable on those things. She gets fat, face goes all weird. M-m-mouse! She drools. Yeah, I guess she's kind of a disaster when she's on them. Yeah, because they kind of turn her into a retard. She can't even do her art projects. Yeah, that's true. Yo, did you call me? Oh look, it fell. We were just talkin' about Emily goin' off her Haldol. Awesome, right, she's no fun when she's on that shit. I don't know, she's staring at something outside the window. Oh yeah? What? I have no idea, could be anything. She's acting really, ya know. Well I hope one of you guys brought bandages or something. She doesn't need any, she brought all those rags from the basement. Jesus, Louis. Go see to your girl, man. Yeah, well, hey, I got this. That's unbelievable. Yo. Think there's someone outside. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never been in the girls bathroom before. You guys are pigs. I keep seeing someone outside sneaking around. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. Come on. Stop it. Get off of me! Don't. Scottie? Was I right about it being locked? Oh, oh, you're like a ghost. I got ninja skills. Oh this school's noisy. What do you mean? So I was cleaning, I heard this clicking and this banging, and then just now... Banging, really? Yeah, but it was like someone outside, like a thunk. Yeah, I heard it too. Show me. ♪ I love to go to school ♪ ♪ I love to go to school ♪ ♪ I love to go to school and follow all the rules ♪ ♪ I love to go to school ♪ ♪ I love ♪ I think it'd be cool one time if you let me cut you. Ha! I could do your back. I can do my back on my own, all I need's a mirror. You could show me where. Drop it. What's with you? You need to leave the bathroom, Louie. What's wrong all the sudden, what did I do? I don't know which is worse, the boy I'm fucking asks me what's with me when he knows I'm bonkers, or that I continue to fuck him. You think it'd be cool if I let you cut me, are you kidding? I'm the only one that can see the patterns. Fucking idiot! I'm gonna leave you alone for a little bit. Yeah, you are. Open or closed? Closed. Fuckin' crazy bitch. At first I thought it was to keep the vandals out. No, Arcadia would've gotten the same size locks on every window, but each one is different. Yeah, maybe they were just trying to save money. Because they didn't have any money left over after the new central air system and the TV studio? Yeah, no. What? Are you guys dressed? It's just me, go away. Okay, I'm gonna get Persephone. Do you really want that bitch up our ass all night? Emily's fine, she's a cutter, this is what she does. When Persephone finds her bleeding like that, we're all comin' back tomorrow. I don't care about tomorrow. We're stuck here tonight if we can't find a way out. Miss Persephone? What is going on here? Hey, Miss Persephone, do you know if all the first floor classroom windows are suppose to be locked? Miss Persephone, I think we're locked in. Miss Persephone, do you know if we can turn down the heat? Are you okay? Miss Persephone? Oh shit. Hey, hey fuckers! Miss Persephone, do you think it would be possible to turn down the heat? But it's already so cold. Scottie, Louis! Oh, no. Oh, no! What the hell? Miss Persephone. - Did they hurt you? - Miss Persephone. They? In her office, she... Breathe. Half of her face is gone and she's just sitting there, she's just rocking back and forth. And I don't get why it's so fucking hot in here. Who's they? Wait, what happened? I don't know, I don't know, but Miss Persephone is hurt. She's really fucked up and we're fucking locked in here with her. Locked in? Yes. Bullshit. Somebody broke the fuckin' key off in here. I'll go get Emily. Meet us by the offices. Okay. In a couple of hours, we go hot. When that smoke bomb blows you're gonna be happy we ran our drill like this, 'cause shit's gonna get real hectic. Emily. Well I wasn't being serious. Goddammit, Emily. Goddammit, what? Well did you cut the right pattern? Look, don't laugh at me okay, - I came back here for you. - I didn't cut anything. Well then your cleaning rags are bleeding. Your clothes are bleeding, whatever, we need to go. Somebody's pushing us. I was chasing four dudes - down the hall... - They're wearing gas masks, I saw them outside. Of course all the doors in the hallway, even Persephone's, are locked. Scottie doesn't even think she's hurt, but I saw. Stop fucking doing that. Funny, she thought that I was seeing things. Mouse doesn't see things. In juvenile hall, they used to play head games like this, all the time, called it experimental rehabilitation therapy. But all it did was break you down so they could identify your weaknesses. Why do you think they're blasting the heat? We're locked in. The guys in the gas masks ran from me when it would've been four against one. And now this, they're stress testing us. Oh my gosh! Emily, you said you didn't cut yourself. There's a difference between cutting and bleeding, Louie. I'm taking her to the nurse's office. Find something to sanitize it with. Louis! Oh, oh, oh, Louis. It's gonna burn. You're okay with that, right Emily? I hope so. Hold her! Ow, please! Ow! It's gonna... It's all right, it's okay. - It's okay, it's okay. - You're gonna be fine. Emily, I'm here, I'm here too. You're lucky you didn't have time to get to your back or you'd be wrapped up like a mummy and the ass hat'll come after you. It's Ammit, and she didn't eat blood, Rakshasa eat blood. What happened? I told Louis, I didn't cut anything. I wanted to but, there just weren't any transmissions. Did someone else cut you? I made the cuts. But you just said... I made the cuts a long time ago. They just started bleeding, and now they won't stop. What the fuck is so hard for you to understand? Okay. Louis and I are gonna do some recon. Find us a way out of here, or someone who'll show us one. It's about to get fucked up! What happened to all this just being about head games? Probably true. But if someone gets... Hurt? Accidentally, because they pushed one of us too far, whose fault is that? Find who's doing this, I'm going to fuckin' kill them. I don't care who they are. I hear ya. Do you? Dude, you went to juvie for puttin' Bart Montandon in the hospital, that means you can do anything. You're a fucking god, man. You know why I took that ax handle to his face? Uh, because he's an asshole zombie like everyone else in this fucking school. Him and Chad Pollard, some of those guys, did something to me after gym class, freshman year. You probably saw it online. What, like the locker room dungeon, hold ah, hold up. Are you saying you were the locker room dungeon boy? But they said that that was a hoax and - you didn't even really do... - that's what they said. And because they covered my face, I couldn't prove anything. My word against the football team's. Now who do you think the maggots running the school are going to believe? I get an opening, I'm going to cross the line tonight. God, I wish there were some vipers around right now, we would take care of 'em for sure, right Scottie? Check it out man, somebody's listening to you. Mouse cleaned this one. That means they're still at it. Let's go to the kitchen for a weapons upgrade. Five, four, three, two. Turner, I don't have a stapler, I can't do that right now. Hey! Get away! What the fuck? Hey. Wait a minute! Pay attention, you fuckers. You wanna see what happens next? Watch the wave. What's it like, having hallucinations? How do you know what's real? What's it like not having hallucinations? If I see it, it's real. Um, so I had a mouse one time. It was like a little white one. And I found her in my basement when she was just a baby. I named her Mouse. I used to hide her in my backpack, and then I would take her with me to junior high, just 'cause I was afraid of what my dad would do if he found her. What, do to the mouse? Uh, to me. But I was being selfish, you know, 'cause I should've been worrying about Vanessa Kebnickies. God, that bitch, she deserves to die. Yeah, right, why, so yeah, so I guess she found out about the mouse and I saw her at lunch one day and she was whispering to Sam Tisdale, and then next thing I know, Sam and Bobby and all those guys, they take my backpack and they start playing keep away with it. They knew Mouse was inside the bag, but one of them dropped it. So they just started kicking it back and forth. And you know, like the harder I screamed at them to stop, the harder they kicked. And then they just kinda started stomping on it. Yeah so, they're done, and I couldn't open the bag, so I just buried it in my back yard. But I knew my dad would beat the shit out of me when I told him I lost the backpack, but I didn't care you know, 'cause I kinda thought I deserved it. Because like, I let something that never did anything to anyone get hurt, 'cause I was afraid of what might happen to me. So that night, when I first saw her, I was horrified you know, 'cause, like, her skull was crushed and her spine was broken and she had like blood in her ears. And I kept thinking about her chewing through the backpack, and then, you know, like digging through the dirt, and somehow finding her way to my house and up the stairs, and to my room, 'cause I mean, she was on the pillow right next to me. And so, you know, I reached out my hand 'cause I wanna hold her, and I want to tell her that nothing like this'll ever happen again and, and I can't. You know, my fingers just kinda slip right through her. That's why I know a million things about what people think happen to you after you die because, if there's an afterlife, I know I saw her spirit. Shit, if you'd told me that earlier, I wouldn't have flushed my Haldol. The first time I ever heard anyone call you Mouse, it was uh, it was old Gus. You must be crazy telling that story to the pervie janitor. Emily, Gus is my father. You knew that. Yeah, come on, let's go! Bring it! Let's see you try to take this from me, you motherfuckers. Come on, we're done here. Keep it movin'. Scores and birthdays, bud. Eat shit. Yes, this is what you need, right thing. Great. All right sweetie, sweetie, I already gave you these... - They dropped on the floor. - Now hold on to those, and just color so mommy can get work done. I can't see through the booth with this ladder in the way. Can I move it? Oh, what're you doing, you silly goose? Come on, keep it moving. Vanessa, Vanessa, Kapnicki. Like your photo. Take another shot! Vanessa! Be cool. Being cool, means being quiet. Oh that's awesome. Oh yeah, yes, you're hired, you're hired, come on. Get up! Come on, you're the one, Vanessa. Come on, Vanessa. - Bring the bitch with us. - Where are you taking her? Where are you taking her? Sammy Tisdale. Death has come this day for you, - Sammy Tisdale. - Tisdale, Tisdale. All right, I guess whatever Gus is doing... - is just gonna have to... - Mom, can I have some juice? I'm hot. All right, let's see what I packed you. Get in there, get in the fuckin' room. Morning, students. Get 'em over there, corral 'em. Against the wall! Get over there you pansy ass. - Get over there! - Against the wall! You too. Get behind the news desk. Get in here, pussies! - Morning, Peter. - Come on, hurry up. - Go on the camera. - Get over there, come on. For what? - Shut up, fucker. - Turn on camera two. Get, both of you. Start it rollin'. You guys ready to be famous, hm? - Hey, let me ask... - Shut up. - You wanna keep living? - I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, be scared. That's my daughter, just please, - let me get her outta here. - Get against the wall. - Please. - Just keep your eyes closed and everything's gonna be okay. God, you're smothering them. I guess that's the point. There, we're done. Students and faculty of Arcadia High. Every day in your classrooms, your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways, somebody is attacked. Students and faculty of Arcadia High, every day in your classrooms, your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways. Students and faculty of Arcadia High, every day in your classrooms, your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways, somebody is attacked. Students and faculty. Students and faculty of Arcadia High, every day in your classrooms, your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways. Students and faculty of Arcadia High, every day in your classrooms, in your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways, somebody is attacked. Okay, I'm officially fuckin' trippin'. This ends now, come on. - Every day in your classrooms - It's right here. Your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways, somebody is attacked. Students and faculty of Arcadia High, every day in your classrooms, your locker rooms, your parking lots, your hallways... - It's one of them. - Somebody is attacked. Attacked and made to feel useless, humiliated, and miserable. Why, because no one sees. Well take a look, and learn. We are the four horsemen of the apocalypse, and the great day of our wrath has come. Why us? Hey, hey. Look at me, look at me. You're gonna make such a pretty, pretty redhead. Give my gun a BJ, come on. Do it good, and I'll let you know before it spits. That's Sammy Tisdale. I fuckin' hated that guy. Hated? - She's just a little girl, - Please, please, - Let her go back to her mom. - Listen to me. This wasn't part of the plan. - Move out of the way. - Stay here. Put the gun, put the guns down... What the fuck? Everyone in this building is an enemy combatant. You can't take her, she's my daughter, - she's a baby, please! - No one leaves this building. Stay back! No one. - Get back! - Please, keep the guns - from by baby. - All right, come on, come on... Fuck it. Hm. It's cute, but Sam Tisdale isn't dead. He would die before he blew a gun. Just proves he's in on it. I don't think he would do it if it was just a joke, - you know... - It's a trick. I think it happened. That's why I saw Miss Persephone's, and the girl. - Girl? - Yeah, what girl? Well there was a girl there. I think that's what they were fighting about. Rewind it, that's Miss Persephone's daughter. These don't connect to anything. I saw some shit too when I was in the kitchen, I saw Gus. Because the people with the fucking gas masks are pumping something in here to make us hallucinate, some sort of agent. Why do you think they're cranking the heat all of a sudden? The air's on, the water, Miss Persephone handed it out in the van, we couldn't even drive our own cars, remember? Now we're locked in. Probably don't want us to hurt ourselves. Huh, you're not that important, Scottie. Come on, don't do that. I need to. Get the fuck... Look, we'll go into the office... - No. - What're you? I'll take you to the nurse... - No. - And I'll... - No, no. - Don't cut me. Fine, fuck you! Bleed to death, fuck. Let me see your hand. Goodbye, Peter. Hold on, it's Duncan. Where're you goin'? It's on zombies! We were just suppose to scare them. Oh come on, what do you think you put in the vents? A smoke bomb. A smoke bomb, ha, stop that. Listen, this one's getting squeamish, I need you to babysit, I'm late for gym class. It's not too late. We can shut off the fans, we can stop this. Emily, Emily, Emily! Emily! - Emily! - You know, you're breathing like you used to when I would come into your room at night. You're, you're dead. That's how I knew that you were as excited as I was. You're not here. Oh I am, Alice, I am. Baby you smell just like your mother used to when she was in heat. Mouse. Run! - Please, I don't want you - Come, come here. to hurt anybody. What do you want? Get off of me! Anybody gets in my way now, I'm gonna fuckin' kill 'em, I don't give a shit who they are. Shit. They do this to you in juvie too? Emily, Emily? Mouse. Emily. You're gonna have to go and find the girls, man. What about you? Meet me in the auditorium, we can leave from there. No, no, no, what if I don't wanna leave, huh? What if I wanna fuck someone up? Who are you gonna fuck up in an empty school? Four dudes? This has gone beyond all that. They have Emily hacking herself to pieces. Mouse, is losing her god damn mind. Fuck that, get the girls, I'll have us out in 10 minutes. Then next week, when classes start, we come back, loaded for bear, and everyone in this bitch pays for what happened tonight. I saw my dad out in the hallway. I saw him like I saw Persephone. I saw him like I saw Mouse. Maybe you're seeing spirits. Yeah. Oh god, oh god. Oh, no, oh. How did you get in here? How did you get here? I'm gonna take these off, okay? Okay. Emily, Mouse. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Sam Tisdale isn't dead. Just proves he's in on it. He's helping them. If you've done anything to Emily, I'll kill you for real. He would die before he blew a gun. He's coming, run! Please, please don't do... Ah, fuck it. S-s-s-suck it. S-s-s-suck it. Come on, F-f-f-fag. Watch, oh wait, watch this. Are you fuckin' tinkling, you tinkling? Come on, look Phil, look at this. - Look at this. - Look at that, look at that, look at that, it's beautiful. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. No, fuck you, you motherfucking faggot. Fuck you. Hey, here's the dungeon boy's... Mr. French, take a seat. Mr. French, take a seat. Mr. French. Now be careful, be careful. Are you feeling okay? Oh! Oh, oh. They're eating it all away. Okay, look at, look at me, look at me, look at me. Don't look, just don't, just don't, don't look at that. Don't look at that at all. Just look at me, okay? Just keep looking at me, okay? It's gonna be, it's gonna be okay, okay? You bitch! Where's my knife, Mouse? - Emily. - You took my knife. No. We're here because of you. I don't need a knife to take care of you. - You ruined everything. - Uh! - Emily. - You ruined everything, and I will ruin you! You're worried about your father? You should be worried about me. Get out of here before I kill you! I will ruin you! She's in the art, she's in the art studio! In the art studio. Don't let them do it. Get away from me! You do not give the orders here, Mr. French. Look at this fuckin' locker room dungeon boy bitch, look at this fuckin' guy. Fuck you! You are not in control, Mr. French. Shut up, shut up you all! Stop! You will never be in control again. Take a drink, take a drink. Ah, tastes delicious, doesn't it? Scottie! Sh, sh, sh. I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't. Stop! Invisible, invisible, invisible. Invisible. Shut up! If you've done anything to Emily, I'll kill you for real. I'll kill you for real. I'll kill you for real. Scottie? Where were you? Where we were the whole time. Where you're goin'. I'm so scared. Go ahead, go! Come on, come on. - Why are you stop... - Hey, hey, there's a girl in the vents. Go on, what are you waitin'? Get out, get to safety! There's a girl in the vent I'm trying to save... Say thank you. Fuck you! Are you one of us, or are you one of them? We had a deal Mouse. I remember it, we help you, you help us. But that's not what happened, is it? Hm? There she is, there's my little girl, there's my star, come to daddy. Fuck you, Gus. Mouse told us about those little movies you made her star in, you sick fuck. You deserve to die. Ain't that right, Mouse? Isn't that what you said, hm? I'll help kill you all over again. I'll help kill everyone in this school all over again. I liked it. End of story. Ow. You tried to save the girl. I'm still trying. Go, I'll save them, you don't need to do any more. Hi Mouse, Hi Mouse, hi. Hi, oh I see ya, I see ya all right. - I see ya now. - Oh here, Mouse. - Louis, Louis, Louis. - Who is that? - You can't catch me. - Who is that? - What, what the hell? - Ali, ali, - Mouse, who is that? - oxen free. Mouse, Mouse, I'm okay. I'm okay Mouse, pull me up. Mouse, pull me up. Uh, uh Mouse. Mouse, what the, what the hell? You're not real, you're not real! Mouse! Mouse! Mouse, pull me up, pull me up now! Pull me up now, pull me up now! Pull me up now! Louis? He's dead. Come on. There's no way out. Not here. Don't ask me how I know, but there is a way out somewhere in the vent. There's a large one in the science lab, we can climb through that. She's still in the vents. I heard her too. I know what you're trying to do, and I won't let you. You can shut off the air and save everyone else in this place, but you can't save her, you're both trapped. You'll run out of bullets. Not before you run out of time. Let's go. You need to get into the vent. Why? Because you think you're better than us. You think you're not a killer. But you put that bomb there. Now no matter what happens, she's going to die. Come on. Scottie. Scottie. - Scottie. - You thought we wouldn't remember. Scottie! Scottie. You thought you could save that little bitch. No, don't do that Scottie, Scottie, Scottie. You can't even save yourself. Scottie. - No. - Yes. You've been blooded since we all took turns with your dad. That was the deal, remember? We take care of him for you, you bring us the keys to Arcadia and its alarm system. Then together, we bring an end to it, and everyone inside. Mouse, he's wrong, you can save us both. The four horsemen of the apocalypse, draw no distinctions You look me in the eyes and tell me different. Fine. No distinctions. I am a killer. No! Come home Mouse. Come home Mouse, we're family. Come along, Mouse. Where were you, Mouse? Come on, Mouse, we love you so much. Come on! It's too late, Mouse. You belong with us. No, Scottie. I belong with the dead ones. Sounds like you were having a nightmare back there. I don't do nightmares. Sure you don't. This whole fucking thing is a nightmare. Tell me again how come Mouse isn't with us?
