(wind blows) * Where the four winds blow * And it's five miles wide * Where a six gun rules and a man can't hide * A man can play * And a man can win * Lucky Luke rides again * Lucky Luke * Born to ride * With a six gun by his side * Lucky Luke * Here's to you * Do do do do do do do * There's a man who waits * Over yonder hill * And when he shoots he shoots to kill * But he don't know * That in the end * Lucky Luke will ride again * Lucky Luke * Born to ride * With a six gun by his side * Lucky Luke * Here's to you * Do do do do do do do * On the dusty trail * Beneath the western sky * Where the sun shines hot enough to fry * A cowboy's dream * Must never end * Lucky Luke rides again * Lucky Luke * Born to ride * With a six gun by his side * Lucky Luke * Here's to you * Do do do do do do do * Lucky Luke * Born to ride * With a six gun by his side * Lucky Luke * Here's to you * Do do do do do do do * Lucky Luke * Born to ride * With a six gun by his side * Lucky Luke * Here's to you (gunshot) [Jolly Jumper] Here they come. This has gotta be one of the most important meetings in the history of the west. (yawns) (clears throat) (trumpet call) The great Indian chief Prairie Dog is about to sign a peace treaty with the United States of America, allowing the settlers who wanted to push west to cross Ute territory. In return, the pioneers are agreeing not to hunt buffalo on Indian land. (trumpet calls) (drum beats) (drum beats) (drum solo) (trumpet solo) (jazz duet) One, two... (flash bursts) [Jolly Jumper] Well, there you have it. That's how peace came about between the white man and the Indian in the Arizona Territory. (wind blows) Martha? Martha, come. Look. A flower. It's a daisy. Why, so it is. This must be fertile land at last. We shall settle here and build a town. We'll call it Daisy Town. (gentle harmonica music) Come on, folks. We've got work to do. (upbeat western music) [Jolly Jumper] And so the good folks started building theirselves a town. And everyone is glad to lend a hand. Zacharias? Yeah? [Jolly Jumper] Well, almost everyone. (upbeat western music) (giggles) (lazy western music) (speaks foreign language) * That saved a wretch like me * I once was lost * But now I'm found * Was blind but now I see * 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear (giggles) (bells ring) (children chatter) (bright piano music) [Jolly Jumper] Well, that's how Daisy Town came to be. And where there's a town, there's saloon girls. * Well, it's mighty good to be here * And it's mighty good to see * That you've all come out to meet my dance hall dollies * And me * Once you're past those swingin' doors * You're gonna shine like the moon * At Lotta Legs Hotel * And the Palace Saloon * If it's entertainment that you want * Come on down. [Man] Hey, it's Lotta Legs and the girls! * We got country singers and gunslingers * All singin' the same tune * At Lotta Legs Hotel * And the Palace Saloon (gunshots) [Jolly Jumper] And where there's saloons, there's fights. And where there's fights, there's outlaws. And the good people who built the town lived in fear. (gunshots) (screams) (laughs) (gunshots) Gun fights came easy in the west. Fellers seemed to get shot faster than they had time to die from typhoid or even snake bite. You know, in the old west gun control meant hittin' what you aim at. (gunshots) (screams) (giggles) (gunshots) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! (horse whinnies) [Jolly Jumper] So it wasn't long before a good town went bad, and the richest man in town was the undertaker and his pet bird. (twangy country music) But every once in a while, a man comes along who's as big as his dream, who fights for law and order and tries to make the world a better and safer place to be. Of course, it helps that he's the fastest gun in the west, faster than his own shadow. That man is Lucky Luke. I should know, I'm his trusty white horse Jolly Jumper and he's my cowboy. (twangy country music) (gunshot) (bright piano music) (shouts in foreign language) (glass breaks) * Hey, put your pistol back in your holster, partner * Back where it belongs * Don't you know you've been interfering * In Old Hank's song * And if you do, maybe me and you * Could be singing our own love song * So put your pistol back in your holster, partner * Right back where it belongs (laughs) * So you say your cactus cutie * Up and left you * So you come waltzin' in and cuss and fuss * Well, that's no reason to go shootin' up my (cheers) * Chandelier * And that's no reason why you go takin' it out on us * Hey, put your pistol back in your holster, partner * Back when it belongs * Don't you know you've been interfering * In Old Hank's song (twangy country music) (stretches) Hi, Ace. Luke! I see you're still cheating at cards. I thought you was in Cheyenne. I was. * Hey, put your pistol back in your holster, partner * Back where it belongs * Don't you know you've been interfering * In Old Hank's song. Hey. (cheers) * So put your pistol back in your holster, partner * Right back where it belongs I thought you were in Laramie. I was. But not anymore. Nope. Still talk a lot? I like your song. Still take requests? Depends on who's asking. I am. Hey, put me down, you buffalo. You heard the lady, cowboy. Out of my way, mister. Isn't this where we left off? What do you say we step outside? No, this is where we left off. I'm sorry. I was talking to you, stranger. This town could use a little law and order. Where's the sheriff? What sheriff? They tarred and feathered him a month ago. Fourth one this year. Yeah, we sure don't have a sheriff. Well, you do now. What, who? Him. Well... Where's my office? The end of town. Hey, what about our shoot-out? We don't allow them in Daisy Town no more. Oh yeah? (gunshots) Ooh-Wee! There's only one man can shoot like that. That there's Lucky Luke. I guess this one's got my name on it. (gasps) (clears throat) (coughs) Come on, folks. We got us a cotton sheet and some tar that's just the right temperature. Hey, lookie here. We got an outlaw to tar and feather. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Did you hear that? Yeah. He wouldn't do that. Who's gonna stop us? Me. (gunshot) (whistling music) (twangy country music) (moos) [Jolly Jumper] Luke cleared the town of its bad element, alright. Hey, what are you doing? [Jolly Jumper] Got rid of the card players and the wrestlers, and stopped the gun play on Main Street. (gunshot) My finger! (soft dramatic music) [Jolly Jumper] Well, I believe we got company. Bad company. And look who's sleeping. (sighs) I have to do everything myself. Everybody up! (yawns) Up and at them, banks are open. (twangy country music) Drop your gun. [Jolly Jumper] A little to your right, Luke. Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. We have target. (screams) (giggles) (whistling music) You're under arrest. Nobody robs a bank while I'm sheriff. [Jolly Jumper] Yeah, now I know why they call you lucky. I see we got a new sheriff. I wonder how long he's gonna be around? (laughs) You don't have to worry about him. That cowpoke can shoot faster than his own shadow. (laughs) I'm not kidding. I saw him do it, right over there in the saloon. That's Lucky Luke. Sure it is. Who are you, his new deputy? Yeah, yeah I am. How come you ain't over there with him? I was just heading there. Watch his hat. (gunshots) Whoa! (whistling music) I'd like to give you a hand, Sheriff. Be your deputy, maybe? I've been following your career and I know you're the best there is. But if you come up against a pack of cowpokes like these. Alright. You mean I can be your deputy? But I want Saturdays off, and I always take my mother fishing every Friday afternoon. [Luke] I said alright! [Jolly Jumper] And pretty soon the good people of Daisy Town got their town back. Going fishing, Sheriff? Yep. Can I ride Jolly Jumper? [Jolly Jumper] No. Alright. Thank you! [Jolly Jumper] Mr. Nice Guy. And I'm the one that has to do all the work. Let's get the whole school up here, why don't we? Daisy Town went back to being a quiet little town, alright. But not everybody was pleased, for business was down, down, down. And Lotta Legs even stopped singing. And the sheriff had plenty of time to go fishing. [Luke] We'll have fried fish tonight, Jumper. [Jolly Jumper] Hmm. Wouldn't happen to have a bale of hay on you, would you? Look, I've got a better idea. Let's go for a nice long ride and stretch our legs, and maybe chase some pretty little mares. (whistling country music) (rattles) Oh no. I don't like the sound of this at all. Luke? Luke! (rattles) I hate snakes. Any time, Luke. Any time now. (rattles) Now, watch your fingers. That's my cowboy. You scared my horse. I wouldn't mess around with Jumper if I were you. (rattles) Scared? Me? No. There you go. (rattles) (twangy country music) (crickets) Hey. Stop that, those are my beans. [Jolly Jumper] Well, excuse me. Here, I'll put them back. (snores) (stretches) Get up. [Jolly Jumper] Ah, you pretty little thing. Oh, those lips and those ears. Oh yeah. Oh, mighty, mighty fine. How about a little kiss, huh? - Come on. - Huh, what? Come on, sleepyhead, let's go. [Jolly Jumper] What time is it? Who are we? Where are we? Why? This is no time for dreaming. Duty calls. [Jolly Jumper] Maybe not so tight this time. Down, lower. [Jolly Jumper] I think I'm gonna throw up. West, where's west? (dramatic western music) Peace and tranquility never last very long. Daisy Town faced a new threat. The Daltons were on their way. (dramatic western music) The Daltons, the scurge of the west. Joe Dalton. William Dalton. Jack Dalton. Why are we going to Daisy Town if Lucky Luke is there? He's only gonna put us in jail like he always does. [Jolly Jumper] And Averill Dalton. No he isn't, Averill. Look, we're going there to get Lucky Luke. (upbeat hoedown music) [Jolly Jumper] Let me see this. He's embarrassed. I love to watch this stuff. The Daltons' horses have conditioned reflexes. Whatever town they're in, they'll stop either at the bank or at the saloon. Of course, they don't always get their priorities right. Not the bank, the saloon! [Jolly Jumper] Hmm, not bad for a cowboy. * This magic moment * While your lips are close to mine * Will last forever (upbeat hoedown music) (footsteps) The Daltons. Guess that old magic still works around here. Give me a drink. (gunshot) I want your best whisky. Yes, Mr. Dalton. You better be reaching for a bottle. Yes, Mr. Dalton. (gulps loudly) (burps) Get your honey, pat on the head. If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread. I didn't know you were such a good dancer. (giggles) (horse whinnies) It's the Daltons. Gee, what a boring town. Music, that's what we need, music. Averill. Oh, goody. (horse whinnies) (cracks knuckles) Cut it out, Averill. (bright piano music) (gunshot) (yells) How you doing, Joe? Lucky Luke. Oh, hi Mr. Luke. You remember me? I'm Averill. And this is my brother William, and this is my brother Jack, and my brother... Shut up, Averill. What do you want, Luke? To take you back to jail, as usual. See Joe, I told you. I told you. If you're looking for a showdown with Joe Dalton, you better think twice. (gunshots) Care to match that, cowboy? Nope. Here, boys. Right, Joe. Right, Joe. Right, Joe. Right, Joe. Put it on your head, numbskull. (dramatic music) (gunshots) Way to go, Joe! Way to go, Joe. What a shot. Could you top that, Luke? Nope. What can you do? I can take you back to jail, now that you've wasted all your bullets. Gee, that was a pretty smart trick. Wasn't it, Joe? Shut up, Averill. No, you can't. You ain't taking us nowhere. We've got amnesty. Amnesty, for the Daltons? Here. "Because of the overcrowding of the jails," "due to the number of new prisoners from Daisy Town," "the inmates who have been here the longest" "will be set free." We're out free and clear, law-abiding citizens. Go near that bank and you'll go right back where you came from. We don't do banks anymore. (chuckles) Hold it right there. (dramatic music) You're under arrest. So now you're arresting people for depositing money in banks. No wonder the prison is full. That's a deposit? You better keep your hands up. This feller is dangerous. Wait a minute, Sheriff. Don't you think you're being a little hard on him? Hard, on a Dalton? No wonder this town's dead, the way you treat visitors. No wonder the saloon's closed, because nobody's there. Bank will close because nobody's making any money. Luke here's scaring everybody off! Mayor, he's ruling Daisy Town. I think I'll make my deposit at Rattlesnake Gulch. Boys. He might be right, Luke. Everything has been a little too slow lately. I can't believe you folks. Where do you think he got the money to deposit? Indians, Indians! I've been shot at by a pack. I tried to make it across the reservation last night, then they shot at me. Indians, Indians! But we have a peace treaty and they haven't attacked anybody in years. It wasn't Indians. What? This isn't an Indian arrow. (mutters in foreign language) West? Actually, east. West of Kentucky. May my veritable friend meet his ancestors on my behalf if he gets the chance, which he will. (shouts in foreign language) (twangy country music) My hats, look at my hats! They're all ruined! My hats are ruined. My merchandise is all wrecked. Who's gonna buy this? I mean, look at this. Who's gonna buy this? Discount. I know, discount. Special sale on hats, discount sale on hats. Sorry, Bowler, but business is just business. I'm ruined. Who'd a thought Indians would've attacked? It's not Indians. Huh? Indians believe that a warrior killed at night will spend eternity in darkness. Indians don't attack at night. [Jolly Jumper] Hmm, that's a new one. Sure did like your speech, Joe. Yeah, good speech, Joe. When are we gonna get Lucky Luke? We already are, Jack. First we see him run out of Daisy Town humiliated because the whole town turned against him. Then we waste him. Not like that, Averill. That's not the way you do it. I'm sure getting tired of robbing stagecoaches, Joe. Wouldn't it be better to do a bank? I mean, we wouldn't have to work so much. When Lucky Luke is gone, we rob the bank, the saloon, the general store. We take anything in Daisy Town we want. Averill, no self-respecting Ute warrior would go around looking so stupid. (gun cocks) Two Feathers, I told you you look stupid. What exactly do you think you're doing? We white brothers wanna make friends with red brothers. Understand? Yes, very well. (exotic flute music) (twangy country music) See? There he goes again. Think you can find your way out of the territory? - Yeah. - Well then, get. Better believe we ain't never coming back. Good. Dullest place we've ever been. Right, tell your outlaw friends. Luke, can I talk to you? Sure. You wanna ride a bit? - Yep. - Okay. [Jolly Jumper] Hmm, this is gonna be trouble. The girls have been wanting me to talk to you. No one goes to the saloon anymore. Everybody's afraid of getting arrested. Well, if they behave themselves they won't. Well, that's just the point. Maybe you're making Daisy Town a little too good. What? [Jolly Jumper] She's saying the town's boring, cowboy, and she's right. We haven't had a decent gun fight in weeks. A town that's too clean starts to die. You gotta have a little light. It helps the economy. I'm just enforcing the law. Maybe you shouldn't enforce it quite so much. You mean, be a good sheriff just part of the time? Yeah. I can't do that, Lotta. [Jolly Jumper] That's my cowboy. (tribal drums and chants) (war cries) What do you think we should do to them? Let them burn over a slow fire? Impersonating a native is a serious offense. Put them in a buffalo stampede. Oh, stop that. We were just dressing like you so we could warn you about them settlers. You don't know what they're gonna do to you. Don't you see? That Lucky Luke and Daisy Town, they're taking over the prairie. You know, * Oh give me a home * Where the buffalo roam. Nice singing, Joe. * Oh give me a home * Where the buffalo roam * Where the buffalo roam. Well, the buffalo are gonna roam, alright. Down in Arapaho country. * Where seldom is heard * A discouraging word * And the skies are not cloudy all day * How often at night * When the heavens are bright * With the light from the glittering stars * Have I stood there amazed * And asked as I gazed * If their glory exceeds that of ours * Oh give me a home * Where the buffalo roam. And the buffalo are gonna roam, alright. Down in Arapaho country. The sky, you're not even gonna see the sky anymore when the white man civilization comes. (explosion) White man's progress is the end of the prairie for you folks. And that's just the beginning, my Ute brothers. * Home, home on the range * Where the deer and the antelope play * Where seldom is heard * A discouraging word * And the skies are not cloudy all day (hums) (hums) (tribal drums and singing) War! No war, not yet. I have to think about this first. First we call a pow-wow. If you keep up the way you're going, you're not gonna have a town anymore. What Daisy Town needs is progress, growth, civilization. But Joe, didn't you just say... Shut up, Averill. Business is down, there's no tourists. There's no growth. This town is dying, and he's the one who's doing it. (murmurs) Luke. Don't take them so seriously. Look, you're just a little too good at your job. Oh yeah? Well, they can get themselves another sheriff. All these people care about is how much money they can make. They don't care who they make it from. Those outlaws have shot more people than we will know in our lifetime. This town's getting a little greedy for me. Luke, come back here. You know you don't mean that! [Jolly Jumper] I reckon he does. I ain't ever heard him talk so much all at one time. (melancholy country music) (twangy country music) Smoke signals, Jumper. Prairie Dog's asking the other chiefs to pow-wow. That's a bad sign. How do you spell Crazy Coyote? With one smoke cloud or two? With two. (exotic woodwind music) Crazy Coyote with two clouds? How ignorant can you get? Crazy Coyote, my chief. Prairie Dog invites you to a pow-wow. May someone respond that Crazy Coyote, chief of the Asuluglala, will attend this pow-wow. May someone prepare my horse. Squaw, I won't be home tonight. I will be spending the night at Prairie Dog's teepee. Crazy Coyote has spoken. Well, don't go riding through the prairie like savages. Squaw has had the last word. Pow-Wow, Sick Eagle accept. Send signal to Chief Prairie Dog that I accept. Send signal to Chief Crazy Coyote that we ride together. And send signal to the chief of the Arapaho to see if he's invited to pow-wow. Maybe someone respond to Chief Sick Eagle that Snake in the Grass has been invited to Prairie Dog's, to Chief Prairie Dog to thank him for having invited me, and to Crazy Coyote to let him know that I'll pick him up on the way. Save hay, share a ride. Tell everyone (speaks foreign language) Thank you for all the messages. Over and out. (upbeat flute music) Something's going on, Jumper. We better check it out. [Jolly Jumper] Where do you get all those bright ideas? (crowd murmurs) (shouts in foreign language) Ming Li is back. (shouts in foreign language) I guess I had to live with pink faces after all. You mean pale faces. Maybe for you, maybe for you. (twangy country music) It says that way. [Jolly Jumper] Then let's go that way. It says this way. [Jolly Jumper] Then let's go this way. And now what? Hmm. I've never seen this one before. [Jolly Jumper] Just stop playing Indian and I'll take you there. (twangy country music) Duck. [Jolly Jumper] Where? Let's skip the formalities. I'm for war against Daisy Town. But you don't even know the reason yet. Come on, come on. The white man's ruining our ancestral grounds. Declare war and get it over with. Let's not lose our heads. We have an agreement with the white man. I propose we smoke peace pipe and go to him, then. We smoke the peace pipe? - Yeah, then... - War. - War. - War. (coyote howls) I'm outvoted. [Jolly Jumper] He's outvoted. Let's go. [Jolly Jumper] Uh-oh. (whistles) Sorry, Two Feathers. Uh, One Feather. Thanks. (dramatic western music) [Jolly Jumper] You know how when you take a trip, coming back home seems to take half the time it took you to get there? Well in this case, it's true. I've never seen the scenery go by so fast. (dramatic western music) Go, Jumper, go! Come on, Jumper. Come on, Jumper, breathe. [Jolly Jumper] I can't do it. I'm not gonna make it. Oh, I can't go on. Come on, Jumper, don't drown on me. I need you. [Jolly Jumper] That's more like it. That a boy. (dramatic music) [Jolly Jumper] Ah, I hate to cross rivers. (dramatic music) [Man] Hey, it's the sheriff. He's back. Oh Luke, thank goodness you're back. Those Indians are gonna attack, ain't they? Yep. The Daltons stirred them up, didn't they? Yep. They coming at daybreak? Yep. Thanks for the warning, Luke. Wonder what we'd ever do without you. [Jolly Jumper] And what about me? I didn't exactly see him walking. I couldn't have done it without Jolly Jumper. [Jolly Jumper] Oh, 'tweren't nothing. [Bowler] Get your souvenirs of the Daisy Town Massacre. Selling them right here today, right here in Daisy Town. These wonderful bowler hats, genuine souvenirs are a dollar a piece or two for two dollars. Get them while they last, while the rush is on right now. Genuine souvenirs of the Daisy Town Massacre. Right here today, right here. Hurry up, hurry up, the rush is on. A dollar each or two for two dollars. Right now today, right here in Daisy Town. You aren't gonna find a deal like this anywhere. (ominous flute music) (rooster crows) Everybody, take it easy. Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes. They ain't moving. Can you see the whites of their eyes? No, no, not really. One, a little bit out in front of the others. I still can't make out the whites of his eyes. Averill, get back in line until I tell you to. I got dust in my eyes, I can't see where I'm going. Look at my eyes, they're all red. I don't wanna look at your eyes, Averill. You advance when I give the command. Who's the boss around here anyway? You are, Joe. - Who? - Joe. Men, light your arrows. And remember, wait until they get real close before we shoot them. But Joe, that might start a fire. That's the whole point, you idiot! Charge! (horse whinnies) (gunshots) Bullseye. Let's get them! (crowd panics) Buckets, buckets. That'll be a dollar. They gotta have them to put out the fire. Business is business. (crowd panics) What's the matter, Averill? I can't find my arrow. Forget the arrow, Averill. (frantic country music) Firemen, firemen! (crowd panics) Wait, wait, no, these hats are a dollar! Wait, these hats are a dollar. These hats have holes! These hats have got holes in them. Well, that's what I've been telling you all along. And now you're blaming me for it. No refund. It's getting harder and harder to see the whites of their eyes. Yep. When you're finished playing cowboys and Indians, you'll understand who's in charge here. Those attacks look good on the drawing board, but in practice they would've wiped us out. It's you Daltons who've caused all the trouble, because you have it in for Lucky Luke. Yeah, he always puts us in jail. Shut up, Averill. Prairie Dog has signed treaty and keeps his word. We go to Daisy Town in peace. (horse whinnies) I see them, I see them! I see the whites of their eyes. (gunshot) No Feather, will you come back here? (exotic flute music) I really did see the whites of his eyes. Chief Prairie Dog, my friend, it's good to see you again. Yes, Lucky Luke, it's good to see you. Could I speak with you for a moment in private? Sure. * Around her neck, she wore a yellow ribbon * She wore it in the springtime * And in the month of May, hey hey * And if you asked her why. They're always late, aren't they? Yep. * Far away, far away * Oh, she wore it for her lover who was far away. Company, halt! * Far away, far away * Oh, she wore it for her lover who was far, far away * Around her knee, she wore a purple garter * She wore it in the springtime * And in the month of May, hey hey * And if you asked her why. This is a rather embarrassing situation. We got a little ahead of ourselves, I think. Yeah, I know. The Daltons fooled the settlers, too. Really? Mhm. If it's alright with you, it'll be better if both sides just forgot the whole thing. Works for me. * She wore it for her lover who was far, far away * Behind the door, her father kept a shotgun * He kept it in the springtime * And in the month of May, hey hey. Well, I guess there's no need for a new peace treaty. Everything's settled. My brother has spoken well. Chief Prairie Dog hasn't spoken bad, either. * Far away, far away * Oh, she keeps it for her lover * Who is far, far away. This is my... Well, some friends of mine. I thought you might need some help. This is Michael... Lieutenant Reed. Now we smoke peace pipe. Laryngitis. Oops, I'll be late for my next battle. Cavalry can't be late. Come on, men, we're out of here. Oh sorry, I've gotta go. I promised my Squaw I'd be home right after the battle. Peace, my brother. I really must get going. Company coming. Upset stomach. Don't look at me, I gave up smoking. (gunshot) [Averill] Did you fall off, Joe? [Joe] No, I always get off this way! Come back here, you forgot something. You're going back to jail. Not without a fight, we're not. (dramatic shoot-out music) (fly buzzes) [Jolly Jumper] Alright boys, now maybe we can have a decent gun fight. (dramatic shoot-out music) Alright, what's the hold up? I can't sit around here all day waiting for some action. (crashes) (gunshots) (yells) You want me, you're gonna have to get Averill first. [Jolly Jumper] Oh yeah? And if you want Luke, you're gonna have to shoot me first. Whoa, what am I saying? (gunshot) (gentle country music) [Man] Way to go, Luke! We're gonna get you now, boys. You're really gonna know what sorry is. Swing in by midnight. I've got a better idea. (whistling music) Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, she loves me not. Loves me, she loves me not. Cut it out, Averill. Bushwack! Ain't it nice to be back home, Joe? Get out of here, Bushwack. Wonder what's for dinner tonight. I hope it's chicken. To Lucky Luke! (cheers) To Lucky Luke, who taught us there's more to life than material things. (cheers) Long may he be our sheriff. (cheers) Luke, we salute you. (cheers) Come on up here, Luke. Come on, come on, give us a speech. Talk to us, talk to us. Trot on up here. (cheers) Well, I didn't do nothing special. Just doing my job. (cheers) They found gold at Old Gulch! (cheers) (frantic country music) (cheers) Come on, there's gold in them there hills. I'm coming! [Bowler] Hats with holes in them. Hats with holes in them. Perfect for panning gold. Hats with holes in them, perfect for panning gold. $10 a piece, two for 20. $10 a piece, perfect for panning gold. These hats are perfect for panning gold. Old Gulch, is that east or west? Never mind, don't tell me. You going? No. I kind of like it here. How about you? Daisy Town still needs a sheriff. [Jolly Jumper] Come on, Luke, we've got a sunset to catch. I never settled in one place before. I know. [Jolly Jumper] Come on, cowboy. (twangy country music) * Of all the lonesome cowboys in the west * I figure I've gotta be the lonesomest * I want to ride the reins where there's lots of elbow room * Feel the wind blow free and smell the sage brush bloom * Rather be on my own, son * Singing my lonesome cowboy blues * Yes I'm the lonesomest cowboy that I know * But when it comes to courting and such * I move real slow * Met a pretty gal and she to get hitched the other day * My horse got so upset we rode the other way * I've gotta be on my own, son * Singing my lonesome cowboy blues * Some folks think it's Heaven in a hotel * With their puffed-up pillows and their quilts piled high * Well, I don't hanker for no hotel * Just wanna kick my boots off by the campfire's glow * While the lonely coyotes cry * Well, my bed is my horse and saddle * And my blanket is the sky * Of all the lonesome cowboys in the west * As far as I can see, I'm still the lonesomest * Beneath the prairie skies * I'm gonna drift and dream tonight * And never find what I'm looking for * But then I might * So let me be on my own, son * Singing my lonesome cowboy blues * Just living the life I choose * Singing my lonesome cowboy blues (twangy country music)
