A day is dawning in 1966 This is the simple, traditional entrance to my grandmother's house, where I lived until I was 3 years old Five seconds from now, it will become avant-garde What's up! Hurts! Why'd you drink so much again! Hey, hey, Eiko san! Eiko san! Get off me! You're still up! You'd wake anybody up This is my Mom Tiny! Run to Daddy's room. He'll behave in there Don't grab my stomach Just go to bed Get off me! Godzilla! I told you not to grab my stomach! Tiny... I'll paint this someday I can paint this a little better I got you something good Here Good, right? Make a face like it tastes good This is my Fujica Single 8 And this is my Dad He's the same person as the slightly creepy young man in the photo The Tokyo Tower, behind him, then about as half-baked as my father's taste in clothes, when finally completed in 1958, was 333 meters tall Even today, decades later, it still stands at the heart of Tokyo and Japan, as centered as the pin of a spinning top These days, I find myself staring at Tokyo Tower from very close by This is the modest story of my father, who got knocked down and kicked out by Tokyo, all the way back to his hometown It's also about me, who came here and lost a place to go home to It's also about my mother, who never had any illusions, but was dragged here anyway, and unable to go home or return, found her eternal rest at the foot of Tokyo Tower < TOKYO TOWER > - Mom & Me, and sometimes Dad - Fujica Single 8 I can shoot that, too Great He was just feeding him yakitori? They don't fit his mouth This is me and Mom and Dad This is my last memory from when we lived together That's when Mom moved us out of my grandmother's house in Kokura and into my grandmother's house in Chikuho You can pass, you can pass Who's narrow path is this? This path belongs to the gods Won't you kindly let me pass... Mom! Your mom's mom Here we go This is where I was born Tasty Thanks Eiko! You're back! Been a while Hello Welcome home, Sister Hey, Ma, you've grown just a little We'll have a feast tonight See you later It was an old, small, mining town, served by a single-track railroad, making 8 trips a day, running in the red Hardly like Kokura, which had been a metropolis It's a crayfish, a crayfish Run it over Run the crayfish over! In this dead end town, I had totally lost it Got it! Now it's a frog Run it over! Run the frog over! Now it's a rabbit I may have lost my mind, but I still had some sense left in me Life is precious Are you working again, Ma? You woke up?

In the course of my life, I've never met a man so utterly free Sometime after finishing 8th grade, I began to have two strong desires I wanted to go somewhere other than here and I wanted to set Mom free By that time, smoke had stopped pouring out of the giant smokestacks of the steel factory in Kokura and the mines in Chikuho To me, everything made by adults, everything I could see, seemed to be going downhill Whatever lasts forever, is what everyone desires without question But if it's not eternal, everything is an illusion With my high school exams ahead of me, I made up my mind to leave this town Come in boss, we've got nice girls Check out the girls, stop in Oh, you're Na san's son You're so cute. How old are you? I'm 15 See my tits? No Did you come to play? I came to study Study? Study tits? No Cut it out. You're scaring him They're scary, my tits are Na san, what are you making him study?

OK, time to eat Thanks for the food All my friends gathered in our kitchen, seduced by Mom's cooking And Mom befriended them, one after the other Mom cooked rice for 10 people though only the two of us lived there In the old days, they had places called Dance Halls That's where we went to dance That's where I learned to dance "QUISAS, QUISAS, QUISAS" That's where you met Dad That's true, but... He couldn't dance Tell us more He seduced you? That's so hip Your father had come by himself and just kept staring at me That's creepy That's right, so I went to scold him, but he apologized so sweetly, and bought me a drink I don't remember our conversation, but I guess I gave him my address A few days later, without saying a word to me, he brought over a betrothal present What! Cool! I was so shocked, I just nodded But enough of my story I want to hear what's going on with you You don't need to hear about us, we're just fine How about you? I'm not...

He said they can't operate I'd better tell Mom Can I be there with you? I see So they can't operate on me? They say you're not quite strong enough Gastric cancer is the same kind that killed that news announcer It won't be easy but we have to try, so they'll put you on chemotherapy Right Try everything that might work I wonder if it'll work A vaccine cured some people It's not government-approved, but you should try it It must be expensive Don't you worry about that Mom, let's hang in there If something happens to you, it won't just make folks back home sad How many friends have you made in Tokyo? All of us love you, Mom Do you know how impossible that is? I wonder... Maybe I should try... Will you try the chemotherapy? The chemotherapy... Yes When I asked her what she wanted, she asked me to bring my graduation certificate She was smiling What an amazing person Thanks for being there I couldn't have encouraged her that much alone You haven't told her we split up?

Maybe Mom had an especially bad reaction, maybe others suffered equally But her suffering was far beyond what I had imagined In pain, suffering, yet Mom never asked to stop it Mom was desperately trying to stay alive The second round of chemotherapy took a real toll on Mom's body, already weakened by the first round How long? How long will this go on? Mom... Mom... You're hanging in there, but what am I supposed to do?

As soon as I finish it It's nearly done See you Open this after I die To Mizue san Dear Ma Thank you for all these years I so enjoyed living in Tokyo I failed in my marriage, but I was blessed with a sweet son, so I can die happily You were a sickly boy and cried a lot, so when I prayed to the gods, it was first for your health And also that you'd be open-hearted As you grew up, your health still came first but also business success These days, I'm greedy and pray for you and your girlfriend's safety She really felt like my own daughter She made me so happy, calling me Mother, mother, like she really meant it I'm so very fortunate to be able to bid good bye to life in a state of happiness Good bye, Ma Mom Let's climb it together, just like we promised Mom I'm still sad, now I can't believe how much of your hard-earned pay I begged off of you My work situation is a little better, but my life's hardly settled I still bring people trouble I've a long way to go I've hardly made any progress Sorry I'm late Where's Mom? Amazing, right, Mom? Amazing It's a little late, but it's from Mom Mom, you wrote me Good bye but you shouldn't have You'll always be my mother, I'll be your son Don't talk like that Mom, I'm so sorry for everything And thank you Mom, it's a beautiful day, today
