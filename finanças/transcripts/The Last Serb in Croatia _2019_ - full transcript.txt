DJ Carrot and our seasoned sound technician Trpimir wish a good morning to our beloved homeland. The most beautiful in the world, which, as forecasters predict, will get 35° C of sunshine today. So, we have a nice, sunny day ahead of us with no hope for rain or wind. But there is hope, my dear listeners! In the last year, only 186.633 citizens left Croatia, which is 4,5% less than in the same period last year. There is a light at the end of the tunnel after all... Zagreb, Croatia, near future Seven years after the country went bankrupt Hrvojka Horvat 4 Return of the Croats Pure Croatian water Purer than tears Pure Croatian water Get that guy away from here! Give that orphan some water. THE LAST SERB IN CROATIA -Chanel 530. -Oh, yes. -Is that all? -Oh, no. -Should I go softer? -Please be so kind. Now it's tickling. What should I do then? You mean tonight? Remember these words before the abyss of hell and fires of thunder devour you. Because we returned here to be masters of our domain. And so shall we remain! Because Croatian presence goes back to the seventh century! It was inscribed in hard stone! And the people that writes its history this way won't let pathetic creatures like you erase it. Good-bye, villain. -The dawn is breaking, Head Master. -The day will come, Hrvojka. -I'm listening. -A new task awaits. To be continued... Wait... For the little kid. Damn Orphans! You give them your hand and they bite off your finger! Forget what I said yesterday. There's no light at the end of the tunnel after all. I'm sitting in the studio barricaded, looking at Trpimir, who turned into some kind of monster. I'm hearing terrifying shrieks outside. I have no idea what's going on. Do we have any calls? Hello, this is DJ Carrot, I'm listening. People started eating other people! It is my pleasure to inform you that our epidemic has successfully broken out! I admit I've completely forgotten. What country is it exactly this time? I think it's written on the bottle. -Cista. -No, the second word. -Hrvatska... -Yes, that's it! Hrvatia! -It's really delicious! -The best water in the world! -And soon it will be the property of... -United Waters! -What is the population of that Croatia? -We'll see. Next to nothing. Two million half, and they have their own country? Yes, ridiculous! Really ridiculous. Less than the number of Turks in Germany. A quarter of the population of Moscow, irrelevant! Wait! What if the virus spreads on the neighboring countries? The Russian garrison of United Army of the World for emergency interventions has put up the fence around Horvatia. -Good thinking. -And electrified fence, of course. And the Italian navy has blocked all sea exits from Croatia. Stop banging, faggot, the noise attracts them! Open the door, guys, my child will bleed to death! -When were you bitten? -I don't understand the question. -Cut the crap! -When were you bitten? I don't know... It's been more than two hours. Two hours? And the kid? She wasn't bitten, she fell out of the car in a sharp curve. -You just keep screaming, faggot! -Please! I'd let the kid in, they can eat him, he's bitten anyway. How come you haven't turned yet... How should I know? You're the doctors, you tell me! Open up, I'll reward you richly. I'm an incredibly wealthy man. -Are you crazy? -Come on. Quick! Close the door! Maybe this man holds the key to this epidemic! Come on. This way. Here... We brought the kid... I'll treat him... -Open... -He's bitten, why did you let him in? Lady, please, I may hold the key to this epidemic... -What? -What is he rambling about? Antiša, lady, if he's to be believed, he was bitten more than two hours ago? So he just need some more time to turn into a monster. -Or he's lying. Let's kill him. -Stop it! Stop it, hold on! Hey, easy! I'll start treating him. If he starts turning... You know what to do, OK? This will sting a little bit... You faggot! Doctor, what's the situation with my daughter Marija? The kid is stable. Probably just a light concussion. She'll be OK when she wakes up. My dick's stable, not the kid! So, she's not bitten? -My beloved daughter! -You sure she's your daughter? -She's obviously an Orphan. -Obviously. I'm asking you for the last time. Is she your daughter? -Well... Not exactly. -Fuck you! Stop it! Maybe he's really the key to the epidemic. Yup, maybe the faggots are immune. If he lied about her being his daughter, then he's probably lying about being bitten two hours ago too. He'll turn and rape us with his evil dick! I admit it... I lied about the daughter, even though... She was like a daughter to me, but I'm telling the truth about the bite. If he was to turn, he'd have done it by now. Maybe that goes for you too. Maybe we can still get to Čepikuće. And maybe you'll have to kill me. Over my dead body. DJ Carrot is with you again, with some new information! If you thought we started eating each other because we're on the brink of starvation, you're wrong. We're affected by an unknown epidemic that turns people into freaks. The virus spreads through bites and incubation period is 20 minutes. Trpimir, maybe somebody attacked us with a biological weapon? But I don't know who would attack us and why. Call me on 555-CARROT. According to some reports, the situation in the countryside seems a bit calmer. Which makes sense, if there's fewer people, the chance of infection is smaller. So, if anyone's listening at all... That's it! We're going out to the parking lot and then straight to the countryside. -Countryside? -Take me to the airport first. I have a flight to Miami to catch. -There's a direct flight to Miami? -What's that got to do with anything? Nothing, actually, but the airport is a great idea! I'm extremely wealthy, I can buy you all tickets to any destination! We'll be there in a flash with my convertible! Take a look, it's in the parking lot. 1500 cc, 86 HP. 1-60 mph in 12,5 s. Take a look. My love. I'd rather turn into a freak than sit in a gay car with no roof. Gay car? DJ Carrot doesn't have the best information for you now. Rail, air and maritime traffic is officially dead. And our whole country is surrounded by wire. It's no joke. Maybe it's a secret plan of the government to stop the emigration? Or maybe we were chosen for an experiment because we're so small and unimportant. Yeah, right. All of you who aren't infected yet and have your phones miraculously working, share your info with me on 555-CARROT. Who's that Carrot anyway? How come we hear only his station? Why doesn't he let through all these listeners who call in with information? Maybe he's spreading disinformation on purpose. Maybe it's in his interest that as many people as possible get infected. You seem familiar, lady. OK, then, people... Let's go to the countryside. Hey! Move that suitcase away. Help her with it, quickly! Come on! You fucked us up! -We have to distract them somehow. -We should escape through a window. There's bars all around the first floor. This one's bitten anyway. He's got nothing to lose. I suggest he gets down from the second floor and distracts the monsters. While they go after him, we run for it. I'm for that. He's responsible for this crap anyway. We should go back up and throw him through the window. -I believe there's another solution. -For example? Is there a morgue in this compound? Of course. In the basement. We can throw the freshest corpse to distract them. -But who's to say that it will work? -No one. But it's worth a try. We the bitten ones will go. Pumpkin... I love you. I know. I love you too. More than life itself. Diseases don't pick and choose. All of them arrived last night. We'll take the largest one. I think he's too heavy for us. -We can take her alright. -They'll eat her faster. She's... Alive! Motherfucker! Hrvojka Horvat?! -The dawn is breaking... -I'll break your head, moron! Make-up! -Where's your sword? -What scene is this? Mrs. Anić, what's the last thing you remember? What's the last thing you remember? I was at a shoot. Then I went to freshen up. I guess I overdid it a bit. I'd say you were clinically dead for a while. Your first overdose? -First overdose? -Yes, yes. The first. -Where's your sword? -Come on, people, there's no time. I'll probably turn into a freak in six minutes. People started eating other people. What did you guys take? Will you put on your costume? It's much more practical than a sheet, trust me. Come on... One, two, three! So... What's in store for us in the episode five? I need to find a sword. Can you help me with the fat gentleman? Fuck, I forgot the box. Have you ever taken a ride in a convertible? A magnificent feeling. Where's Antiša? I'm afraid he didn't make it. Hrvojka Horvat? -What... The dawn is breaking... -Your Mom's heart is breaking. -Your movies suck balls. -I agree. DJ Carrot finally with some good news! There is a light at the end of the tunnel after all. I've found out that some people are immune to bites. If you know anything more about this, call 555-CARROT. I was supposed to be on that plane. If I hadn't hit you with my car this morning, you'd have been dead now. Man, I saved your life! -What are you looking for? -Something for my nose. I have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed. I thought you'd be completely different. Does anybody have a half of something? Can you tell us at least the surprises script-wise? Get off my back already! Is that a satellite phone? Are you calling for help? -Unfortunately, it's not working. -Let me see... -What's the PIN? -I told you, it's not working. The system is down and the PIN doesn't work anymore. I believe the Frankfurt airport is crowded? Unfortunately, I am not in Frankfurt. Some idiot knocked me down while I was waiting the taxi for the airport. -I woke up in the hospital. -Bummer... I suggest you send the helicopter. We'll do our best to get you out of there as soon as possible. I'm sending the coordinates as we speak. Everything OK? -What? -You OK? Yes. Fucking hell... That was close. Mrs. Franka, this might hurt a tiny bit now... -Did you find water? -No. -Let's go... -Mrs... There's an exit 20 km from here. If there's water anywhere, we'll find it there. Kid! You take over, I'll take a little rest. -I don't know if that's a good idea. -Can I take over? I'm an excellent driver. -And also... I'm a top notch DJ! -You'll keep me company. Let's go! Missus, please, get in. Come on... -Why haven't you turned yet? -I'm wondering myself. Maybe... What's your blood type? -B+. -Eat shit! I'm B+ too. That must be it... -You mean, you're bitten?! -Bite my dick. What do you think about Hrvojka Horvat and her movies? Just the best. Full-blooded action spectacles with a powerful sexy heroine who also fights for the freedom of her people. Intense plot based on true, but freely interpreted historic events that give the movie credibility and, dare I say, authenticity. Fuck... How about you? -I think it's idiotic. -OK. Make your case. -It's got nothing to do with real life. -That's exactly why they are good. Real life is terribly boring. OK, apart from the last couple of hours. Do you think she's banging the Head Master? I kindly ask you not to speak of Hrvojka Horvat in that way. This here is... Electro-traditional festival in Đurđevac. -The festival... -It was awesome. And this is Terezijana in Bjelovar. You're so cute! Homos... Cool. So all this had to happen for me to come out of the closet? Out of the closet? -I'm afraid it's beyond help. -I'll die again. It'd be a terrible blow to Croatian cinematography. Where are we now? I guess 20 km from the Bosnian border. How do you know? I was a girl scout once. -Where are we going, anyway? -To get water. Do you think she used that suitcase on wheels in girl scouts? Dracula Inn, Slavujevci, 1 km Slavujevci -What is this? -Slavujevci. In Cyrillic. Why? -I guess it's a Serbian village. -Terrible. Dracula Inn I've survived '41, I've survived '95, and I'll survive this 2000... What year is this? -Hold on, lady! -I'm no lady to you, but a comrade! Comrade, we're not infected! Hold it, gran! You see that they haven't turned into vampires! Hrvojka Horvat... Fucking hell. -The dawn is breaking... -Break your dick, Serb boy. The Jurčićs from Golubovci. So, you started killing Croats again? -She's joking... -Don't say that, Mrs. Hrvojka, please. Us and the Jurčićs were like two peas in the pod. It was an exemplary coexistence. But they came this morning for a coffee, turned into vampires. Not like in the last war, but for real! They started biting and sucking our blood, we barely managed to defend ourselves! You mean, you've been bitten and that nothing happened to you? What do you mean, I feel bitten like a Swiss cheese! Judging by the sign at the entrance to the village, you and the lady, I mean, comrade... You're... Serbs! Is that a problem maybe? My wife, Jelena Dracula. What are you doing here? We escaped from Zagreb, everybody turned into vampires over there. Look at her, she's no match for her onscreen presence. I knew it, it's all make-up, editing, computers. Like the nation, like the super-heroine. Heroine... What about you? Did you charge them admission fee? -What admission fee? -The fee! For the Dracula homestead. Come on, show me the money! -How much? -50 euros per capita. Isn't that a little too steep? 50 euros... Is there some food included in the price? Is there some food for these guys from Zagreb? Mrs. Dracula... I have a favor to ask. I have to cross the Bosnian border. I see you have a tractor. I'll pay whatever you want. Ask my husband. I'm in charge of finances. Mr. Dracula... Maybe it'd be better if you turned the music down, as we've noticed, vampires are attracted to loud noise. -What? -I said... You're such hypocrites, you Croats. Some Europeans... And all of you listen to folk trash music at home. -Do you maybe have brandy? -Homemade plum. I'll have that. -Quarter liter for 10, a pint for 15. -Euros, I presume? No, bitcoins. It'd be better if you turned it down. We know it attracts monsters. No problem. Gran will get them with her gun. But apart from us Draculas from Slavujevci and those poor Jurčićs from Golubovci, there's not a soul to be found here. Jela, turn the music down, please. Look at Hrvojka... She's drinking pure Serbian plum brandy as if it was pure Croatian water. -The dawn is breaking... Serb guy. -The day will come, Hrvojka. Got a cigarette? Sure. Roll one for me too. It's a pleasure to watch you. Your wife said you could take me to Bosnia with your tractor. Bosnia? OK... I'm going there tomorrow. We're selling brandy to Bosnians ever since their government banned alcohol. -Don't shoot! It's me! -You?! -Why did you leave me? -We'll explain later. Comrade, don't shoot. The young man is no vampire. What the fuck are you doing in a Serbofascist village? We were Partisans! -My folks weren't. -Who's this guy to you? Our companion, who we thought was dead. Come here! -Is it safe? -Yeah. I won't let him into my house. -Want me to kill him? -Yup! Zagreb guy, move so that I can take his bald head off his shoulders! Let's solve this misunderstanding through dialogue. Fuck that dialogue shit and move! The young man isn't what you think he is. What's stopping me now from killing him? -Nothing. -Let me explain. This young man here turned into a vampire about an hour ago. In the meantime he obviously turned back into a human being and has now turned back into a vampire. -So? -He's important. Regardless of his convictions, which we all strongly condemn. This disoriented vampire Croatofascist is important?! Yes. -What are you banging about? -He may hold the key to the epidemic! Think about it... This discovery might make you rich. -OK. What do you suggest? -I suggest... Is there a separated building on this homestead? -You mean, a cellar? -A cellar. And where do you think I keep my brandy? OK. We take him into the cellar, tie him up, observe him for couple of days and when we figure it out, we let the institutions know... But the Draculas take credit for the discovery. Of course. -You'll take me to Bosnia first. -What Bosnia? You said you're going to sell brandy there. What brandy, can't you see I have to observe the scientific experiment?! Looks like watching my movies isn't such a waste of time after all. -Triple room, 99,99. -All together or... -Per capita. -Yes. I don't know if I'll have enough. I must say you surprised me with your cellar rent price. -How about you? -I don't have any. It's all cash I've got. -You? -What about me? Let me see what you have in that suitcase. Out of the question. I can't take this anymore. Look at her threads! I am lacking clothes as much as Croatia lacks Serbs. This should be enough. Good night. -Who are you? -What? You've got a load of cash, a ticket to Miami, satellite phone, so who are you? Just a regular business woman. With a business phone and cash for travel expenses. I was heading to Miami on business. Who are you? You think you're not suspicious? You're loaded, you drive a convertible. You'd buy us all plane tickets... Who are you? I don't understand. The Motika? Hello? Start the meeting without me. I have to get out, the signal... Tell them what's going on, they should send help! Where is my bloody helicopter? We are doing everything in our power to get you out but flights in Croatian airspace are currently forbidden. We are looking for alternatives. Don't you fuck with me! If you piss me off, I might call one of my friends journalists and tell them how much you've paid me to plant the virus! We can simply say you're crazy and leave you there to turn you into monster. True, but then you'll never learn why some people don't turn although they have been bitten from head to toe. It has come to our knowledge that some people are apparently immune. Are you saying that you know why? Yes. Republic of Slovenia Serbs? Immune? Why does it ring a bell? Haven't we bombed some Serbs? -Those were other Serbs! -What other Serbs? -Serbs from Serbia. -I see. -Then, what Serbs is she talking about? -Serbs from Horvatia, I guess. You've lost me! She's talking about Serbian ethnic minority in Croatia. Your people in... France? Or my people... Everywhere! This could jeopardize our entire operation. How much have we already paid to that woman? Fourteen million dollars. Bear in mind we've also promised that after the epidemic her country will spread to include part of Croatia. -What country is that? - I forget it. I am sure you've never heard of it. This monster of a woman has dropped the virus into our country. -Into our country? -And for what? For Great Slovenia! Get out of here! You don't give a shit, you're Serb anyway. What does it have to do with anything? Only immunity saves Serbs. The storm is brewing. We have to let somebody know. -But who? -About the storm? I never thought I'd say this, but Croatian people deserve a better heroine! Listen, you terrible, evil woman... -If you don't hand over the phone code... -What will you do? OK... Bite her! Why... I'll explain later, just... -Don't... -Bite her! -No, I fucking won't. -What's your name again? Maks. Just bite her once, I'll explain everything later. Come on. 1406. Guys, what the fuck is happening to me? If you were standing, I'd tell you to sit down. -Hello? -DJ Carrot on the line. Mr. Carrot, we just stumbled upon a very valuable information. I'm listening. Looks like the citizens of Serbian ethnicity are resistant to the virus. Mister, please don't use this phone line to make bad, poor and stupid jokes, OK? Mr. Carrot, I ask you to please trust me. I ask you to hang up because someone serious might be trying to reach me. Remember the words of this man who speaks the truth. Hrvojka Horvat? The dawn is breaking. Trpimir, we have to let somebody know. Lulea, Sweden Research center for contagious diseases We have the information. Fuck, this means that I'm half... My whole life is a giant lie! Hey... You can always find comfort in the fact that some people are pure... My Mom was always suspicious... Serbian whore! It'll be... Ladies and gentlemen, we are happy to inform you that only 24 hours after the outbreak of a dangerous, unknown epidemic in Croatia, we are already at the threshold of a revolutionary discovery. Namely, all indicators suggest that the citizens of the Serbian nationality are immune to the virus. That will guide us in an attempt to find a cure for the infection. -General Lee! -Ass Lee. Ass Lee Turchinson. You mentioned last night that you were seriously considering dropping a human bomb on Croatia if this dangerous epidemic were not kept in check within a few days. -At our headquarters, actually... -Human bomb? What is a human bomb, general Ashtree? A human bomb, ladies and gentleman, is our latest, state-of-art weapon, it's bomb that kills only people but leaves everything else, trees, plants, animals, lakes, unharmed. Have you lost your mind, general Trashley? Ass Lee Turchinson. Relax, please, Miss Gambini. Now that we've found the ingredient necessary to make a... -Please, Dr. Rostock... -Life-saving serum, general. Now that we have found that thing, there is no need to drop the bomb anymore. Unfortunately. Dr. Rostock, what happens to the people who get infected? They turn into the walking dead. They become zombies. One question for Francesca Gambini De La Norde, our famous activist and globalization critic. Yes, grazie. -What are you doing at this conference? -Damn good question. I am here to make sure that the human rights are not violated. But zombies are not human! Doctor Rostock, can you be so kind to tell us... Sorry, but I have more urgent things to do. I have to find a person of Serbian nationality and start working on their blood to find a cure... -Heavenly people... -Fucking heavenly people! Get that brandy. Congratulations. I was suspicious from the beginning as to why I wasn't turning into a monster. Then I realized that our people were immune. I knew you were one of us. Know what? I misjudged you. I even feel like giving back that money to you. -God saves the Serbs! -Serbs. Mr. Srbljanović, are you a Serb? No, you are! -Sorry... I know I fucked up. -No, it's my fault. You should not turn your back to a woman like her. And I took pity on this poor guy. I don't even know why. I'm not usually like this. -Like what? -Like this. Soft. Franka... -Can I ask you something? -What will happen in episode five? No, just... Why do you take drugs? -Can I ask you something? -Anything. Drop the formal address. -What's your name anyway? -Milan. Mićo. Milan. -Milan what? -Milan Motika. Why does it sound familiar? You probably heard of Mane Motika, the man who found a water well on his land which turned out to be the best water in the world and... -Pure Croatian water? -Yes. He then sold the well to the state for an absurdly large amount of money. And so you became absurdly rich. True Croatian dream. There he goes again... Tell gran to have a shot with us, for immunity. Where are your folks from? To the cellar! Vampires! Brandy! Maks! Maks, let's go! Watch out! What the fuck is this? Croatofascists, traitors and impure Serbs. Stand back. United Army of the World Where have you been, Hodžićs, my dear brothers? Where have you been, Draculas, resistant Serbian beasts? Did you see that? That's heavenly people for ya! What's that, Meho? The Carnival came too early? Nope. Just a check-in with neighboring and friendly Croatia. Emergency situation. We were all drafted. Let us cross over. I would, but I can't. The circumstances have changed, I could be court marshaled for it. What circumstances, Meho? Who made brandy for you all these years? Twice distilled, so that it's better and softer for you. I can't do it, Dejan! There's a refugee camp, not even 2 km from here. Where FC Gavranovac used to be. FC... I don't know what you call it. Is that Hrvojka Horvat, man? Hrvojka, is that you? The dawn is breaking... The day will come, good people. -I need your help. -Shoot, Hrvojka. We have to let somebody know we found the formula for the serum. Tell us and we'll forward it. You should just mix Serbian blood with brandy. If I didn't die from laughter right now, I never will! I thought it was Hrvojka Horvat, but it's a bad stand-up comedian. Yeah, right, Serbian blood and brandy. That can only make you a bigger fool. Imagine those zombies becoming Serbs. And drunk, on top of that! Only brandy saves zombies. Zombia all the way to Tokyo. Zombie's too late again to save Kosovo. No one can beat suffering zombie people! Kosovo is the heart of Zombia! Fuck your moms! Are you disrespecting Serbian people? The heavenly people! I swear I didn't know. I was told it's a harmless flu and that they were trying out some new medicine. I was tricked too. Give me your phone. And the charger. Serum Serbum, third try. The third attempt failed. Drop your weapon! -We need to talk to somebody urgently... -Silence! United Army of the World Colleagues, can we talk... Hello. I'm Jana Zdovc. I'm the commander of the anti-virus team. This is my deputy, Dr. Adnan Zdovc. We wish to welcome you to the refugee camp Plitvice 2. I hope this situation will be solved soon. What are you doing in this hell, lady? Come on, untie the lady, quickly! Don't ask. I should warn you. These two aren't normal. They aren't harmless either. Hold it... Aren't you Hrvojka Horvat? Thank God. Look, we found the formula for curing zombies. -Really? -By accident. See this young man... -Sir, feel free to continue... -This young man is half-and-half. I saw you had similar cases outside in cages. Anyway, this young man accidentally drank brandy with some of my blood. Serbian blood. After that, he turned back into human and never changed again. In other words, he's cured. We have some brandy here, we can show you. I'll give you my blood, it won't cost you anything to try. Take that brandy from them. And the phone. I don't know what this terrible woman told you, but she was the one who dropped this terrible virus in Croatia! -I have proof! -Really? Show it to me. -Not on me, but... -Sir, it's OK. It's OK. Colleagues will take you into a tent, OK? There you can have some water, a sandwich, and psychological assistance, if you need it. -Please, colleagues... -Please, lady... Easy, relax... I haven't had coffee in such a long time! You can have one here. -You're really kind. -Don't mention it. Let's go, Janči. -You can join us for a review, OK? -OK. If you don't send me a helicopter in the following thirty minutes, I am calling the press and I'm going to tell them everything. And not only that. I'll give them the recipe for the vaccine. And if you're wondering if this is a blackmail, it is! The recipe for the vaccine? -Who are you? Where's Mike? -Mike is on the toilet. Ja Boris. You can tell me everything you would tell him. We are more or less like one body. Some people here have discovered the cure for the infection. Luckily nobody believes them, but I've seen for myself that it works. And I am very close to let the world know about it. -Did you say the cure? -Yes, the cure! Madam Vesna, just go back to the fence the same way you came. We'll make sure the electricity is off. Hey, Mikey, how are you my friend? How are you doing guys, hi! -My dear general Lee. -Ass Lee, Ass Lee Turchinson. - Ashley. I need a favor. -Anything you say, Mikey, I'm listening. Hrvojka Horvat... The dawn is breaking, Hrvojka... The day will come, Head Master... You're the Head Master? Where's your sword? And your shield! -Mad enemies stole them! -What should we do now? We should acquire a phone... A satellite phone... So that we can let the knights know where to look for my weapons. I can get it. Your courage is great, little knight. But the enemies are much stronger than you. I've already stolen cigarettes and crossword puzzles from them. Like you, when you snuck into the villains' tent and stole the plan for destruction of the thermal power plant. Then go, little knight! And may good Lord and mother Croatia keep you from harm! Hrvojka from now owes you a favor. -Stop, little knight! -At your service, Head Master! In the medical tent, on a bed, there's a bag with... With a magic potion. Bring at least one bottle. Yes, Head Master. Mrs. Vesna! Come on, join us for the viewing. Strange world of the living dead. He seems different from all the others I've seen. Yes, the virus is probably mutating, Vesna. I'd like to go to the tent, to freshen up and have a sandwich. Just go. I'm thinking about those red eyes... You shouldn't think too much! Jana! Bravo! Hrvojka Horvat! We've found the formula for curing zombies! I'm listening. Mr. Srbljanović, have you got any homemade schnapps? No, you have it. -You're one of us, Head Master. -I am. But you can call me... the Liege. Brothers... The Liege needs some of your blood. Quince Apricot Plum brandy Maks! Zombie serum! This is not a zoo, kid! Scram! Boy, it works! I'm Dr. Zdovc's colleague. I went for a short walk... The Head Master and Hrvojka are actually husband and wife, right? Yes. But you can't tell anyone. It's top secret. Go to bed. A lot of action is in store for us tomorrow. Yes, Head Master. It is my pleasure to inform you that we have found formula which turns zombies back into human beings. Vials with the combination of hard liquor and Serbian blood called Serbum are already on their way to Croatia. Good morning from DJ Carrot! And it's more than good! A serum that turns zombies back into humans has been found! Trpimir, the light at the end of the tunnel is getting nearer! So, I'd like to thank all our people in our homeland for calling in. Thank you to Serbs in Sweden who selflessly donated blood and brandy. But the biggest thank to Dr. Rostock for discovering the serum. I can proudly state that the German medical science is the best in the world. Maks! Maks! I'm not Maks. I'm Nemanja. I have to admit, I don't understand. You will. - Why are you speaking Serbian? - We're the Neo-Serbs. We'll kill you all. -Vesna! -Join us. I'm Svetlana. Wait! Wait, something's wrong with the serum! OK... If you leave the tent again, we'll shoot without warning. Are you OK? Listen carefully, people. We have to leave as soon as possible. Now that we finally have the serum, why should we run away? The army told us to wait in the tent while they vaccinate them. The serum is dangerous. It's turning zombies into Neo-Serbs. Do you hear this? That's Neo-Serbs. And they're sickly dangerous. Come on... I won't run away again... Whatever happens, happens. Dear Croats! And the Serbian minority. Follow us and it will get better! My ass it will. Come on. Neo-Serb brothers and sisters! This planet is Neo-Serbian and it shall remain Neo-Serbian forever! -Who's not with is... -Is against us! DJ Carrot is with you again! But this time, I'm not alone. With me is my colleague sound technician, former zombie who received a Serbum shot. So, Trpimir, let's hear it from the source... How do you... feel? Your favorite show is being taken over by DJ Stick. People, don't vaccinate anybody! There's a different word for vaccinate in Serbian. As you probably suppose, this was not an easy decision to make, but dropping of human bomb unfortunately was the only solution. The longer we wait with this decision, the direr the consequences will be and much sooner than we expected we might find ourselves threatened by the horrible, extremely dangerous, bloodthirsty, multi-million terrorist organization who calls itself Neo-Serbs! I know some of you will notice that there are still some normal, living human beings there, but I remind you of the words of Jesus Christ himself. One said: Sometimes we must sacrifice one lamb for the safety of the rest of the flock! I knew that in the end everything would be perfect! Shall we? It is time! Five! -Four! -Dear Lord! -Three! -You're great! -Two! -You rock! -One! -Oh, my! Launch it! -For Neo-Serbia! -Ready! Slavujevci A couple of days later. Croatia is already populated by the workers of United Waters. That is mine. -Do you speak English? -This shield is mine! Sure, take it. Good luck. Peace. Good luck. -So, will you finally tell me? -What? What happens in episode five. -But you can't tell anyone. -OK. The Head Master and Hrvojka fall in love. And have a kid. I knew it!
