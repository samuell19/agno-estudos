I love you. I love you, Charlie. I love you. Are you scared? I'm scared, too. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, I love you, Charlie. Charlie, I love you. I love you, Charlie. Charlie girl, that shoot was insane, but I'm finally on a flight. I'm gonna need a drink when I get home, or 17. Oh shit, we're taking off. Happy anniversary, baby. I love you. See you tonight. Oh! God. Simone? Babe? Hey Barker. Your mom will be home soon. Oh. Hey, it's Simone and you are apparently someone who still leaves voicemails. Kind of weird. No one does that anymore. How retro. Hey, it's me. I can't wait till you get home. Can you tell? Sorry, I just, uh, want to make sure you're on your way. I thought I heard you come in and I got really excited, but, anyway, I tracked your flight and it said you got in on time, so I hope Philly was good, and the shoot. Maybe I can be on the next one. You know, I've been working on my airbrushing while you've been gone, so anyway... Happy anniversary, babe. I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. Oh, god. Barker! God. Uh Simone, could you... Oh. For the photo shoot. I mean, come on, right? It's good. It's really good. Oh, look, it's so fucked up. Can you imagine being done here at dark? It's gonna scare the shit out of me. I can't wait, I'm so stoked. Girl. Get to the bar and make bad decisions with me. Right meow. Right now, do it now. Right now, okay? You know what? Fuck this. I'm calling you. - Hello? - Uh, hello. Yo! The Trap. First round's on me. Get yo shit, girl. Are you sure it's the first round? Whatever, your first round. Don't fucking judge me. I would never. - But I can't tonight. - Why? I'm waiting for Simone. Tonight's our- - Oh, god! Why am I not surprised? Oh, yeah. That's right. It's because you wait on her like it's your full time fucking job. It's all you do these days, dude. Come on. You used to be fun. Remember? Fun. Hm. Hello? Yeah, I'm still here. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, but like low key, you know that I'm fucking right. Like, all you do is like cry and complain about that bitch. Don't call her that. I can call her whatever the fuck I want. I've known her longer. Remember? Thea, it's our anniversary tonight, okay? Which you would know if you ever listened to me. - Hey, I- - And I don't wanna hear anything negative about the woman I love. I don't think that's too much to ask, do you? Oh, okay. All right. So where is the woman that you love right now, huh? She is on her way home. There was a shoot she couldn't pass up and it was a great opportunity so she did it and she's on her way home right now. Yeah, see, that's exactly what I'm fucking talking about. She's never home. She's always somewhere else. You're always alone. And wait, why didn't she ask you to come with her on this shoot? If it's such a good fucking opportunity, why is she hiring some fucking hack makeup artist - out of fucking Pittsburgh? - Philly. Whatever. It's all gross. Listen, I know that I introduced you two, and quite frankly, I kick myself for that on like a regular fucking basis. Thea, cut it out. I, dude, like, I'm glad you're having fun. Oh my god, mom, really? You're becoming a little butterfly and spreading your wings. I just wish that you hadn't moved in with that bitch. Am I not being clear? I don't want to hear this. I'm just saying. Watch your back, girl. I know the shit that she fucking puts people through. Yeah, fucking Simone. Her reputation precedes her. I don't even have to say her name and people already know who I'm talking about, yeah. You know who I'm talking about. Davey, you definitely know who I'm fucking talking about. She's sadistic. Yeah, I know. You have told me like 20 goddamn times. Okay. Sorry. Truce. I'm not trying to hurt your fucking feelings, I just, I have your back. I'm always gonna have your back. And I don't really think telling you the fucking truth and telling you to open your eyes - makes me a bad friend. - Simone and I are fine. She's on her way home right now and now my... Charlie don't do this. Don't get all pissed off and hang up. Come on. Don't be lame. Look, I will talk to you tomorrow, okay? Have fun. Fine, bitch. Bye. Bye. Shit. Hi mom. Oh. Mom. I can't hear... Yeah, I ca... I can't hear you. Yeah, mom, just click, click on the... Oh my god. Yeah, mom. Down. Uh huh. - And to the le- - That's it. Can you hear me now? Yes, I can hear you. Hi Char. Hi. I never used this thing, but um, I thought it would be nice to see one another. It's been so long. Yeah. Hi. So how is everything? Must be so many distractions up there. Are you still doing your little makeup projects? Uh, yep. I'm working as a professional makeup artist and things are going really well, actually. Oh Charlene, I didn't mean anything by that, really. - No, it's fine. - I mean... No, no, no, no, no. No. You were always so good at that and I'm glad that people are appreciating what you can do. And you're doing what you love. Well, thank you. I remember when you were little, you used to put makeup on every doll and stuffed animal that we ever gave you. Do you remember that? I'd come into your room and there'd be magic marker all over them and blue eyeshadow and, and rosy red cheeks and red lipstick. You had the fanciest dolls in town. Yeah, I guess I did. I totally forgot about that until right now. Yeah. I... It's good to see you. It's good to see you, too, Charlene. I like that lipstick color you're wearing. What's that? Oh no. I'm drinking red wine. They're just stained. Oh. Oh, well what you look very pretty. Um hey mom, I'm kind of in the middle of something. You said there was an emergency? Everything's fine. I just wanted to see you face-to-face because, um, because your memaw passed away last night and- - Oh, god. - Just thought - I should tell you so. - Oh, I'm so sorry, mom. Yeah. It's okay. It was her time, you know? She was ready to go back to the Lord. I'm glad she's not hurting anymore, really, just, you know, it was kind of bad at the end. God, I wish I could have talked to her. Yeah. I mean, we could have called you I guess, but Charlene, I just want you to know she loved you very much. - She did. - Oh. Well, when, when's the funeral? We're just gonna have a small thing so it's really nothing to fly back for. Don't worry about it. No. No I, I mean, I, I want to be there. No, no, no, it's okay. You don't have to. I did want to ask you, um, can you send back that necklace that she gave you? I'd like to have her buried with it. It was her favorite. Um, what necklace? It was the cross, remember? The gold cross she gave you. You took it with you when you moved. Yeah, um, yeah, I, I think I have it somewhere. You think? You didn't lose it, did you? No, no, no. I'm sure it's in my... Look, I will be able to find it, okay? Well, can you go and look for it? I'm kind of in the middle of something, mom. What do you mean you're in the middle of something? I called you and you're just, you're drinking wine in that cave of yours. You can't be that busy, Charlene. Come on. Jesus Christ. Please don't take the Lord's name in vain. Mom, it's not a cave, okay? I live in a pretty nice apartment, actually. Yeah, and I've never seen it really, so, how would I know? When you showed me pictures of it, it had all those Satanist things all over the walls. Satan... We don't have Satanist stuff on the walls, mom. They're antiques. Some of them are crosses. Antiques? Yeah, okay. Well who put those in your apartment? Was that you or was that your, your roommate? What's her name? Simone? Yes. My roommate's name is Simone, and she's not a Satanist, mom. - That's not even- - Is that you? On the wall there? - Who took that? - No. - Mom, no, that's not- - Who took that? I... Simone did. Okay? Mom, she's a photographer. It's art. Okay? It's not- - Can you just please go find my necklace? Just please. I really need it. Do you ever even think about me? How I'm doing or think to call me when you don't need something? Your grandmother just died. My mother is dead. All I'm asking you for is to go and look for the necklace that she shouldn't have given you in the first place and send it to me so I can bury her with it. What is the problem? I will look when I have time. - Anything else? - You know something? I'm just glad that she can't see you right now and what you turned into. I haven't turned into anything, mom. You just never figured out how to accept that I- - I don't have anything more to say to you. Great. - Great seeing you. - So just go find my necklace. Okay. I will talk... Wait, mom. Hold on. What time is it there? What do you mean? It's the same time as you? Is it, is it daytime still? Are you trunk? It is 2:15 in the afternoon on Friday and you're drunk and alone. What has happened to you, Charlene? Where's the time? You know what? Nevermind mom. - Thank you so much for- - Just go find my... - Would you please? - Okay. Thank you so much for the phone call. - I will find your necklace- - Oh my- - And send it to you and then you never have to talk to me again. - Oh my goodness. - Okay? Thanks for the invite to the funeral. I will never talk to you again. - I just want my necklace. - Bye, mom, yeah, great. Oh, god. Oh, god. Hello? Is anyone in the hall? Our door is stuck again. Hello? God, god. Fucking... Really? Where's the fucking time? What the fuck? You're not here. You're never here. Why are you never here? Where are you, Charlie? Charlie. Charlie! Girl, put some motherfucking pants on and get to the bar, now, right now, right now. Love you. You enjoying this? We have got to move. Hey, Vito. It's Charlie Crane from apartment 1-R. Listen, our front door is stuck again. I can't seem to open it from the inside and I think someone covered all the windows with some kind of tarp. Is there work being done on the building or something? Please call me as soon as you get this, I'd really appreciate it. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Ugh. Simone? Simone? Oh. Jesus. Please pick up. Pick up, pick up- - Hey, it's Simone and you are apparently someone who still uses voicemails. Kinda weird. No one does that anymore. How retro. Hey, it's me again. Um, I'm sorry to call so much, but are you here? Um, I heard someone like walking around in here and I think our bedroom door is real- Oh, call me when you got this, okay? Love you. Bye. Hey, hello? Can you hear me? Please, please. My door is stuck and I'm locked in my apar... Hello? Hello? Hey, can you hear me? I think we live next door to each other. I'm so sorry, but my front door is stuck. Would you be able to help me open it? Ma'am, hello? All right. That woman next door is crying again. Oh, the girl is always crying about something. - Yeah, geez. - No wonder he's gone all the time. Oh shit, I forgot to tell you, the Latz Gallery is showing some of my work next month. You're going to be hanging on some walls in the Village. How fucking dope is that? Oh my god, that's great. What? I said that's great. Which ones? Some nudes. You're cool with that, right? I mean, it's an incredible gallery. Whatever you want, babe. - I'm so happy for you. - Right? Hoping someone rich wants to buy you, you know? Then I'll try to sell them a picture, too. I'm kidding, duh. Yeah. Oh hey, I got some plans with some friends later. I haven't seen Marcy in a while. Hope it's okay. Charlie? Is that cool? Char? Hello? Marcy? Yeah, of course. But you'll be home later, right? Of course, silly. Hope you have a great time. I love you. She's still not there yet, is she? She is stuck in traffic. Hey, what time is it? Five o'clock somewhere. Ha. Is that why you're calling me? Partially. I don't know. Why don't you look at your phone? - No, seriously, can- - Why don't you call Simone and ask her what time it is? Hey yo, can I get two more and the check, please? Where'd you get those pants? Ooh. Turn around. Walk away. Thea. What? There's some really nice butts in here, girl. Just, is it dark outside? - Tell me that. - Are you fucking high? 'Cause if you are, I'm gonna be really be pissed- - No, I just- - That's you're high without me. Like, there is something on my windows. I can't see outside. Hey, do you have a charger? - For a phone? - Oh my god. - A phone charger. - Thea. What? What? - Did you hear me? - What, it's on your windows? Yeah, it's like a tarp or something. Ugh. I can't reach it from the inside. Actually, can I get another one? Maybe they tented your place. They did that to mine like a couple of weeks ago. It's really annoying. Yeah, maybe. Fucking go outside and check. Like, why are you - calling me? - Because I can't - go outside, my front door is- - Oh, fuck. Hey, um, do you- - What? - Have a charger? Dude, my phone's about to die. Hey, do you have a charger? For a phone? You're still at the Trap, right? Uh, yeah. Can I call you right back? - Yeah, but- - What? Oh for fuck's sake. - Get fucked, motherfucker- - Can you just come- - I'll fucking smile when you die. That wasn't for you, it was just some fucking creepy- - Thea. - Fuck you! Oh my god. Dude, listen, my phone's going to fucking die. Can I just, like, call you right back? Just let me charge up real quick. Yeah, but do you know when that'll be? I'll call you right back. Bye, bye. Thea? H... Dammit. Oh. Thank you for the wild flowers. You're the wild flower. I love that. Turn over. No, the other way. What, like this? Mm-hm. I never thought of myself as a wild anything. Wallflower, maybe. Everyone's different. Head and profile. You're my wildflower. I wish I could be... I don't know, more like you. - Silly. - I do. You're... I want to be enough for you. Stop it. You are. Arch your neck a little. Hey. Come here. You're distracting me. - Come here. - Stop it, stop it, you're distracting me. You're distracting me! Stop it! People are fascinating. And strange, they're so strange. I love figuring out what makes each one tick. The pieces of them. Literally, pieces. Their skulls... Bones... And heart. Their beliefs. Love. Okay. Hey Vito. It's Charlie Crane again from apartment 1-R. Listen, I'm, I'm getting kind of freaked out and since you're not picking up, I may have to call somebody else about this door. Um... Yeah. Sorry, um, but I just wanted to let you know, so. Have a good weekend. Okay. Sorry. Bye. 911. What's your emergency? Hi, I'm, uh, this is really silly and I'm so sorry to call you guys, but I'm not sure what else to do. Sorry, I'm... I'm locked in my apartment. My front door gets stuck sometimes and I tried my super, but of course he's not answering and my girlfriend should be home soon, but I just- - Ma'am, is this an emergency? I mean... Yes. Can you help me? Yes, ma'am. What's your address? 107 Forsyth Street in Brooklyn. Apartment number? Uh, apartment 1-R, as in retro. Okay, ma'am. Help is on the way. Thank you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it- Thanks. Hello? God, are you, are you okay? There's just no way. There's no way. There's no way. No way? No way out? Are you stuck, too? I, my um, my door jams and it has before, so I'm stuck too. Are you locked in your apartment? Hello? Please, please. I'm hurting. Will you, will you pray with me? Um... I don't... I mean I, I haven't in a while. - I just- - Please. - Please pray with me. - Oh, yeah, no. I'm sorry. Yeah, of course. Um, I'll pray with you. Sorry. Did you want me to- - We need the necklace. What did you say? To pray. We need the necklace. Go find your grandmother's necklace, Charlene. Sorry. How do you know my name? Have you been listening to me? Who are you? Huh? You know what? Mind your own fucking business. Hey Thea. Hey Thea. Hey babe. - Listen- - Hold on a sec. Sorry. Hold on a sec. Sorry. - Yeah. - Sorry, just one second. Sorry, just one second. - Stop it. - Stop it. - That's not funny. - That's not funny. What is wrong with you? Charlie, who are you yelling at? Sorry, Thea, just two seconds. - This bitch. - Bitch. Stop it. Fucking stop it, fuck off! Fuck off! Sorry, Thea, I just- - Dude, is that fucking Simone? What's wrong? There's this, this woman in the other apartment and I can hear her through the wall. Yeah, I mean, it is Brooklyn. No, this is different. She can clearly hear me, too, because she won't stop repeating every goddamn word I say. Okay, that's creepy. And I've already called my super twice about the door. Of course he's not picking up, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because someone's on their way and I can get this fixed before Simone- - Charlie, can you just like stop for a second? Stop. Like, I really hate to tell you this, but I don't think Simone's going to be coming home anytime soon. Thea, I really don't need this right now. Holden just posted a pic. The two of them are like out at a bar. Simone is in the city. She's fucking living it up right now. Go look for yourself. - That's an old photo. - No, babe, it's not. It's on her story. Go check, I'll wait. Charlie, I fucking hate this, dude. I fucking hate this, but like, I told you. - I tried to tell you. - I um... - God. - I gotta go. I have to wait for someone to open my door so I'm gonna, I'm gonna sit here and wait for that. No Charlie, fuck that, don't do that. - I gotta go. - Come on. No, Charlie- 911, what's your emergency? Hi. I called a little while ago. I'm locked inside my apartment and I think someone should be here by now- - 911, what's your emergency? My emergency is that I am locked inside my apartment and I need help, okay? Again, my address is 107 Forsyth Street in Brooklyn. Ma'am, is this an emergency? Yes, it is. I am locked inside my apartment and I want to get out. Yes, ma'am. What's your address? Oh my god. I just told you. 107 Forsyth Street in Brooklyn, apartment 1-R. Apartment number? What the fu... Are you even listening to me? - I just said apartment 1- - Okay ma'am. Help is on the way. What apartment number did I just tell you? - Hello? - Okay ma'am. Help is on the way. Okay ma'am, help is on the way. Okay ma'am, help is on the way. Okay ma'am... Okay ma'am, help is on the way. She doesn't care. She's never coming back for you. No one's going to save you, Charlene. Hey, hello? Hello? Please turn around. I'm in apartment 1-R, I'm right behind you. Please help me open this door. Please help me open this door. Please. - Do you hear me? - Do you hear me? - Please help me. - Please help me! Shut up and leave me alone! Please. Please. Charlie, what the fuck? What, are you fucking following me now? Are you fucking kidding me? You're just sitting in my own fucking house not letting me in? Are you kidding? This is my goddamn home. I don't ever want to see you again unless you're moving your shit out of my house. Please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please. I just want to be with you right now. No, no, Charlie. You want to be me. I cannot take a fucking breath without you inhaling, too. You're always right behind me, following me like a fucking shadow! I just want to make sure you're safe. What the fuck are you even talking about safe? I was out with my friends. I know, they're they're my friends t- - No, they are not your friends. This is exactly what I am talking about. They're not your friends. This is not your house. This is not your life. They are my friends. This is my house. This is my life, and I will not let you continue to fucking hijack everything! I know, I know, I know! I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. Please. Please, just come back inside. I just, you're just gone all the time. Why aren't you ever here? Why aren't you ever here? Huh? I don't care if you're out. Just answer your goddamn- Simone? Simone? Simone? Simone? Fuck. Please turn around. Please, please, help me! Come on. 911, what's your... This isn't happening. This isn't real. None of this is real. What do you want? I need help, please. Please. Please, please, please pick up, pick- Thea. Oh, thank God. Where, where are you right now? I'm at the bar still. The bartender let me use her charger. Is, uh, Simone not there yet? No, she's not. And there's so much happening right now. I found someone's phone in the basement. I called 911 because I can't get, I can't get anyone to help me right now, including you. I said I'd be there when I'm done. Yeah, but you're not here. I need you, Thea. I need help. And 911 isn't working. It's like a recording or something. It sounds like, I don't... I need... No one will come here and help me. And I... Goddamn. I... I found the necklace, but my mom fucking, god, she hates me and Simone isn't coming home because I'm boring and I can't do anything right. I ruin fucking everything I touch. I don't know what to do. Thea? Thea, where are you right now? You're not here. Thea, I need you to come here and let me out of here, okay? I need that as a friend. - I can't help you, Charlie. - Why? Why can't you come and help me? Thea. What is that... What is that sound? Are you, are you at the beach? - You're not here. - Thea. What are you talking about? - I... - You're not here. You're not here. - You're never here. - Thea. You're never here. Thea, don't. I can't hear you. Don't walk away. Thea, come back. I, I am scared. I am your friend and I am fucking scared right now. I need you. Thea? God. I love you. I need you. You're not here. Hello? Ma'am, are you okay? No way out? Are you stuck, too? You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here, you're not here. You're not here. Where does it all come from? Because in reality, we're all just animals in a pit, fucking and fighting and trying to make... Make everything seem like it matters. You put two people in the room long enough together, they're either gonna end up fucking or killing each other. Or both. And you scared? I'm scared, too. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not here, you're not here, you're not here, you're not here, you're not here, you're not here, you're not here, you're not here, you're not here. You're not here. You're not here.
