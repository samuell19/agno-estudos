(sweeping orchestral music) - [Narrator] Once upon a time, as they say, long before the time of Syrius and his Fire Child, the gods of fire and water lived as one, as brother and sister. And the earth rested in a misty nimbus of peace. But like many fairy tales, ours begins with an act of evil. For Algorac, the Dark Lord of the Winds, grew jealous of the happy pair. And he planted the wicked thorns of suspicion and hatred between them. The thorns took root, and turned brother against sister. Great Oceanus, King of the Waters, rose up in a fury and sent his waves raging around the globe. So mighty that they even threatened the great Palace of Hyperia, Queen of Fire. (waves crashing) The earth was in chaos and fire and water were split asunder. Never to be rejoined. - [Voices] Hyperia, Hyperia! Save us from the sea! - Oceanus is responsible. Algorac has turned him against me. They want to extinguish my flame and wipe me from the face of the earth. (waves crashing) They will not succeed. My flame will live. My children, gather your fires and come with me! (tone warbling) The storm is dead. The earth is calm. This Holy Flame must be watched well. For as long as it burns, the sea will be calm and the children of fire shall live. (sweeping orchestral music) (soft piano music) (subdued music) (yawns) (yawns) (yawning) (sighs) (playful music) - Wake up! Wake up! Up and at 'em. Good morning! Ooh. (grunting) (blows raspberries) - Hey, calm down, you little tadpole. - Morning. - [Seahorse] Bibble, be quiet. - [Seahorse] For goodness sakes. Stop making so much noise! Wait, where are you going? Bibble, stop! - Yoo-hoo, Syrius! Wake up! You promised to take me hunting! - [Seahorse] Bibble, shush up. Don't wake up the prince. - [Seahorse] Prince Syrius needs his sleep. He gave the strictest orders not to be disturbed. - [Bibble] He did? - [Seahorse] Well, he would've if he hadn't been so tired last night. - Oh, be quiet. He promised he'd take me hunting. It's time he got up anyway. Oh, there you are. Hey, let's go catch ourselves a jellyfish. Look at what I've come up with. He won't stand a chance against this. (laughs) - You'll have to do a lot better than that, Bibble. - Let go, come on! Let go! - Well, what are you waiting for? If you beat me there, I'll give you my knife. - Oh, here I come! Last one there is a sea slug! - They're going to get themselves into trouble someday, I tell you. - It's most distressing. (subdued music) (Bibble sneezes) - Ow! Hey, what the? Oh, It's you, Bibble. You're still with me, huh? Okay, okay. Let go, let go. In the name of King Oceanus, I hereby dub you Sir Bibble. Knight-errant and protector of the Water People. Now, to prove your worthiness, you must fight and destroy that creature of darkness. - Yikes! - Here is the knife you wanted. Now, now, Sir Bibble. Go on, go on. - But, but, I... Syrius! (grunting) Here goes nothing! Take that! - Have at him, brave Sir Bibble! (yelling) Don't worry, I think you're tiring him out! - Syrius, Syrius! - Use your knife! - [Bibble] I can't! I can't! - What's wrong, Sir Bibble? - You can have your knife back, anything, only help me! Help! - Help you? Well, why didn't you say so? Wee! (grunting) Not so fast! - Wait for me! (dramatic music) (gasps) It's the Forbidden Zone! - Wait here. - Syrius! (gasps) He's disappeared. (creatures chittering) (growling) - Aha. Geronimo! Huh? (whistles) (grunts) (subdued music) Oh. Huh? What was that? (grunting) - Syrius, why'd you do it? Now, I'll never see you again. Huh? (bats screeching) (yelling) Help! What a way to go, and I was only looking for some fun. Some friend you are! How could you leave me here? Help, help! I'm too young to die! Syrius! Syrius! Come on, come on! (panting) Syrius! Syrius, wake up! Wake up! Huh? No, you can't be dead! No! (crying) Prince Syrius is dead! Huh? (yelling) (coughing) (sighs) Are you all right, Syrius? It serves you right, running off into the Forbidden Zone like that. - I dreamed that I saw something. (grunting) I saw a fire. - You what? You saw a fire? - And a girl beside it. - Come on. Come on, let's go. This sounds like trouble. Let's get out of this place, Syrius. Syrius! Syrius! Syrius, come on, let's go! Whoa! (yelling) (grunting) Huh? (sighs) - Hurry up, hurry up for goodness sake! (lighthearted music) Don't move. - Let me just fluff this a little for you, Your Highness. - He looks beautiful. - Pretty as a picture. - And now for the finishing touches. There, and there, and there. Well, what do you think? (sneezes) Sorry, Your Highness. (march-like music) - Huh? Hey Syrius, what's the big idea? Going to a costume party? - Costume party, indeed. This is the prince's 16th birthday and we're going to his coronation, you little ruffian. - Coronation? - That's right, Bibble. We're off to pay our respects to King Oceanus. Hop aboard. - Jumping jellyfish. What fun! Come on, we're going to see the king! (chattering) It's Prince Syrius' coronation! (chattering) Come on, everybody! - What did he say? - The king! - Hey! Syrius, here we come! Come on, everybody! Let's go! - [Oceanus] There is no place on earth as beautiful or as happy as our Kingdom of the Sea. And it is because of your brave efforts, Syrius, that the world beneath the waves has remained peaceful and calm these many years. There is only one way in which we can repay your noble service to your king. And so, Prince Syrius, we give you what is rightfully yours. - The Eye of Algorac. - [Oceanus] Yes. The ancient eye taken from the evil Lord of the Winds, who now sleeps in the depths of the Forbidden Zone. From this day forward, you shall rule the sea in my place. But I warn you, Syrius, do not go near the Forbidden Zone. Without his eye, Algorac is powerless. But if he should ever get it back again, evil will return to the sea, and the whole world. (yawns) - Oceanus! - [Oceanus] The future of our kingdom and its people is now in your hands, Prince Syrius. See that you guard it well. - Syrius, you're the king! You're the King of the Sea! Hooray! (cheering) - Hooray for King Syrius! (cheering) (roaring) (laughing) - What's this I hear? Syrius is the King of the Sea and wearing the Eye of Algorac? Ha, it's a joke! It's a scream! (laughing) Now listen, everybody. Who should be king, this snotty nosed sea snail or me, Mugwug the Magnificent? Everyone who prefers Syrius, take a step forward. - Yeah! - Come on! Put your dukes up. - Huh, what's this? Nobody? (laughing) Can't say I'm surprised. You see, Syrius. The public prefers Mugwug. - You're out of your gourd. - Huh? - Well, to begin with, who'd want a king that looks like a soggy hamburger? - Hamburger? That's the rudest thing anyone's ever said to me. Get him, boys. - You got it, boss. - No problem. (grunting) - Now, Syrius, why don't you just hand this over, huh? Come on, give it to me. - I'll give you this. (growls) And that and that. - Now, I'm mad! (Mugwug yelling) - [Syrius] Here you go! (Mugwug yelling) - Huh? - What the? - [Fish] We're coming, master! Don't leave, don't leave! Wait! - Come on back and we'll do it again! Right? - Hey, right. (cheering) (moaning) (sighs) (yells) (sighs) (sighs) Only a dream. (soft orchestral music) (laughs) - Oh, Malta, my daughter. You're here already. You are as steadfast as you are beautiful. And the sea remains calm and peaceful, only because you are there night after night to keep the holy flame from going out. - Of course, Mother. You may sleep soundly and depend on me as always. - You are already talking like a queen, my child. But listen, Malta, there is one thing you must never forget. Always be on your guard against the children of the water. For they are not our friends. In fact, and you must remember this, - [Both] The water is the enemy of the flame. - How could I forget it? I hear it every night, Mother. - Malta. - (laughs) You know you don't have to worry on that account, Mother. Anyway, you don't think I'd want to make friends with any of those silly Water People, do you? - No, but just make sure that you never forget that, Malta. - I won't. I know where my duty lies. Goodnight, Mother. - Goodnight. And good fortune go with you always, my daughter. (subdued music) (water dripping) - Who was that boy who came from the sea last night? Oh, no. I must be careful. I'm supposed to be the brave daughter of the Queen of Fire. There's nothing to be afraid of. (gasps) Oh, what a coward I am. I'm a hopeless coward. - [Voice] You sure are. Shame on you. - Ah! Who is it? Who's there? Piale. - Piale, that's right. - You're not supposed to be here. Get back to the palace. - I want to stay. Piale loves Malta. - Don't be ridiculous. Get back to the palace. - No! Let me stay with you, just for tonight. Besides, you need Piale. You're afraid to be alone, aren't you? - Oh, you! I'm not afraid of anything, you hear me? (Piale laughing) Piale, be careful. You'll die if you fall in the water. ♪ Malta is a scaredy cat. ♪ ♪ Malta is a scaredy cat. ♪ - What a little idiot. I don't care if you do fall in. - [Piale] Oh, Malta. Don't be angry with Piale. Please, don't be angry. Malta? Malta? - Look. How beautiful it is. When fire and water are joined together, why is it so... (gasps) - What? - We must've been put under a magic spell. - Huh? - They tried to lure us under the water just then. But it won't happen again. I won't let them get the best of me. (clearing throat) (crowing) (yawns) - Syrius! Syrius! Hey, have you guys seen Prince Syrius? - [All] Huh-uh. - Have you seen Prince Syrius anywhere? (cooing) I bet you guys haven't seen him around either, huh? - [All] Huh-uh. - Syrius, where are you? Suffering Sargasso. He's left me in the lurch again. Whoa! - If you're going to dance on my head, do you have to make so much noise? - Sorry, Aries Turtle. I didn't know it was you. It's just that Syrius has got me so steamed. He ran off without me again. - Little one, the prince has a lot on his mind these days. Perhaps, he doesn't have as much time for his little friends anymore. - Oh, yeah? Well, I'll show him! (laughing) (rumbling) - There. (subdued music) (gasps) (water splashes) (gasps) Tell me, who are you? - Huh? - Are you a Fire Child? - Mm-hmm. - You don't look much like a savage. - (gasps) What do you mean a savage? What an idea. Who are you to call me a savage? - My name's Syrius. I'm a Water Child. - [Malta] A Water Child? One of the accursed race. - [Syrius] What accursed race? Is there a curse on me? (Syrius grunting) - Wait, don't go. Stay for a little while. Here. We're far from the flame here. (yelling) (water splashes) (Malta laughing) Syrius. Is that what you said your name was? Mine's Malta. - Malta? - Mm-hmm. - That's a funny name. - Oh, what manners you have. Well, not everyone thinks it's a funny name. They call me Malta of the Flame. Malta the Fair, Malta the Fabulous. - Tell me, what is Malta the Marvelous doing in a place like this? - I must protect the Holy Flame from ever dying. (subdued music) (sighs) That is why no child of water is allowed here. But for you, I'll make an exception. Because you're not a savage and I like you. - Woo! - Are you leaving? (whooping) (laughing) I am a child of fire and you are a child of water. How can I trust someone who came from beneath the waves? Maybe you've come here to lure me into the water. Or maybe you've come here to cast a spell over me. I think maybe you've been sent here to bewitch my heart. - Huh? - Are you trying to find my heart? You've got to catch me before you can steal my heart. (Malta laughing) (yawning) - So, little one. No luck finding your friend? - Who, Syrius? He's no friend of mine anymore. - Is that so? - (laughs) You mean not everyone under the waves can swim? - Hermit crabs can't. (laughs) They just crawl all around with their houses on their backs. - Oh, really? You know so many interesting things. - (laughs) I don't know half as much as Aries Turtle. - What's an Aries Turtle? - He's an old sea turtle and the wisest creature in the sea. - Oh. Oh, it sounds like a wonderful place down there. (Syrius gasps) What is it? Syrius? - I must go. - But why? Why do you have to go so soon? - Because it's almost dawn. - But why do you have to leave at dawn? - Because... If the sun shines on a Water Child, he dies. - He dies? That's what happens to us if we fall into the water. You must hurry up and go. And so, I guess this is goodbye. - Goodbye, I guess. - I know. We can... We can meet here every night. - Every night? - I don't think you want to be here with me. You love someone else, I suppose. - No, really, I don't. - That's good, because I want you all to myself. - Huh? - You're cute when you're confused. Now then, it's all set. We'll meet here every night at this time. I wonder if this wise old sea turtle of yours would know. - [Syrius] What? - If a Water Child and a Fire Child can ever be close friends. He won't know the answer. I don't think anyone knows. All I know is that I've never felt anything like this before. (yelling) (gasps) (sighs) Goodbye, Syrius. - Until tomorrow night. - [Malta] Tomorrow night. (whooping) (subdued music) - Malta? Malta, where are you? Ah. (Piale giggling) Come on and play with Piale! Malta, what's wrong with you? - Oh, I wish I could live in this moment forever. Haven't you ever wanted to dive into the water, Piale? Haven't you ever wanted to meet a Water Child, Piale? But no, of course not. Because the Water People are the enemies of the flame. But why? Why? - Malta? Piale loves Malta. (snoring) (yelling) - Come on, wake up, Bibble. Up and at 'em. (laughing) - [Bibble] Where have you been? - Woo-hoo! (laughing) Woo-hoo-hoo! (laughing) - Syrius! (laughing) (laughing) (tense music) (laughing) - There you are, Malta. You look particularly lovely tonight, my child. - Thank you, Mother. I feel lovely tonight. I'm as light as air. I sometimes feel I could almost walk on water. - Don't talk like that, Malta. You know I worry about you guarding the flame all alone. Now, why don't you stay here tonight? - Stay here? What do you mean? - Let me send someone else to guard the flame instead. - No, you can't. I must go, Mother. It's my duty. - Malta, after all, you will soon be queen and then you need never guard the Holy Flame again. - No, Mother. I insist that I go. I must go. Syrius will be waiting there for me. - [Piale] Malta, I'll come with you. - No, go back, Piale. - No. - Go back, I say. Do you think I can't take care of myself? - See if I care. - Hey, wait up. Syrius, wait for me. Where ya goin'? - Where I'm going, you can't come. - What do you mean? Of course, I can. - I'm not gonna tell you again. Go on, leave me alone. - Well, go ahead! Huh. I hope he gets swallowed by a sea snake. (water splashes) - Syrius. Shh. (subdued music) Over here. This way. - Huh? Huh? Malta? Malta? (barking) (Malta laughing) - Syrius, welcome to the Garden of Enon. - Huh? - (laughs) These are my loyal protectors. Aren't they cute? - [Syrius] Come here. (Malta laughing) Wait. (both laughing) - [Malta] You can't catch me. - I'll catch you. (both laughing) (grunts) Are you all right? - [Malta] Stop! - Oh, I, uh. - You play too rough. - [Syrius] Malta, I. - Syrius. - Huh? - Here. (Malta laughing) - [Syrius] Stop, stop, wait a minute. (both laughing) (yawning) - Syrius. He wouldn't have gone back into the Forbidden Zone, would he? (rumbling) (gasping) (subdued music) (tense music) (electricity zapping) - Jellyfish attack! - Close up shop! Let's go! Let's go, come on! (yelling) - Geronimo! (Bibble grunting) (yelling) Why you no good lily-livered. - We can't just sit here. We've got to do something. - But what? - Attack, I guess. - [Both] Goodness gracious. (subdued music) (water splashing) (tense music) - [Syrius] Uh oh, there's trouble. - [Malta] Don't go. - I have to. But don't worry, I'll be back. - Syrius! (groaning) - Prince Syrius! - What happened? - [Seahorse] The jellyfish. We couldn't stop them. - Bibble, are you hurt? - Why don't you go back to the Forbidden Zone? - [Syrius] Bibble. - And that pretty Fire Child of yours. - What's this? A Fire Child? - What are you saying? - That's right. I was there. I saw the whole thing. Leave me alone, you traitor. - Bibble! - [Seahorse] Prince Syrius, this is most distressing. - [Seahorse] You met a Fire Child? - [Seahorse] You entered the Forbidden Zone? - [Seahorse] That's impossible. It's, it's. - [Both] Forbidden. - Is it true, Prince Syrius? Prince Syrius! - This is most disturbing news. - Most disturbing, indeed. - Syrius. Where are you off to? Come here. Why are you floating about at this ungodly hour? - Tell me, Aries Turtle. What exactly is so evil about the Fire People? - The Fire People? - Mm-hmm. I know one of them who is very kind and very pretty. - You... You met a Fire Child? Oh, my prince, this is terrible. It must never happen again, do you hear me? - Why is it terrible? What's wrong with the Fire People? What's wrong with my loving Malta? - My prince, there happens to be a law here in this Kingdom of the Sea which states that none of us can ever come in contact with a child of fire. - Who decided on such a law? I don't care! I don't care, I love Malta. - Be a man! You're now the king of the Water People. It's time you realized that and started behaving like a king. - Maybe you're right, but I love Malta. Can love be wrong? Do I have to choose between loving someone and being king? - Hmm. Well, Syrius. Now you know that being king isn't all a bowl of caviar. It comes with responsibilities. - What'll I do? Hmm? No. - Take care, Syrius. I worry about that boy. - Oh, Syrius, where are you? Where are you? - Well, I think someone should tell King Oceanus that Syrius is acting very strangely. - Very strangely, indeed. - Shh. I don't trust him when he's behaving like this. Come along. Come along. - [Syrius] Malta, Malta. - Aha! There you are, Syrius. Listen, Syrius, you just weren't cut out to be king. I can understand, it's a lot of hard work. But take a look at me, Mugwug the Great! Mugwug the Magnificent! Mugwug the King! I'd make a terrific king, really I would. So what do you say? Give me the Eye of Algorac! I wanna be king! (yelling) What a king I'd make! What do you say? - Take a look. - Huh? - Oh well. (laughing) - I guess that means his answer is no. But I'll be the king yet. (laughs) (subdued music) - Malta, what's wrong? You're acting very strangely. Is it because of the great solar eclipse that is coming in only a few days now? - The great eclipse? - Yes. When a brave new sun will be born out of the blackest moment of darkness. And you will inherit my crown as Queen of the Fire People. - (gasps) What? No, no, it's too soon! Please, Mother, not yet. I want to stay as I am for a little while longer. Let me guard the flame. - What has gotten into you, Malta? You're behaving like a silly little girl and not like a queen at all. And now, children of the fire, go with Malta to guard the flame tonight and dance with your future mistress. - No, Mother, no. Please, let me guard the Holy Flame alone. I won't have many more chances to do it. I'd rather be alone. (barking) I will soon be leaving you, my loyal friends. They tell me I am to be Queen of the Fire People. Then, my days in this garden will be through. So, let's have a mighty flame tonight. - [Syrius] Malta! Malta! - Ah, Syrius. - Yahoo! - Syrius. It's so good to see you. I was waiting for you. I thought maybe you wouldn't come back. - Don't be silly, Malta. I'll always be here. All those laws about children of fire and children of water have nothing to do with us, you know. Nothing on earth will keep me from you. You'll see. - Oh, Syrius, I hope so. - A Water Child! - Piale, stop! (Malta yells) Syrius! (water splashes) Piale, what are you doing? - Piale doesn't love Malta anymore! I never did! You'll pay for this! - Piale! Piale. (sobbing) - Malta, I love you, Malta. (crying) - Syrius. - Huh? - I'll never forget you, never. - What? Malta. - Syrius, this is the last time you will ever see me. We shall never be able to meet again. It is over. Over. - Over? (subdued music) - Oh. No, it's not over! No! No! - Syrius. - Wait, Malta! (water splashes) Malta, Malta. Malta. - Syrius. - Malta! - Take me with you, Syrius! (yelling) (water splashes) - Aries Turtle, it's you. - So, you wouldn't listen to me, eh? - Don't be afraid. It's only my old friend Aries Turtle. - So this is the Fire Child Malta. She certainly is an exceptional beauty. It's understandable you lost your head over her. - That's right, I love Malta. And why is that wrong? I want you to tell me. - Calm down, my prince. I think it's about time I told you why a child of water and a child of fire cannot be together. - No, we don't want to hear about it. - Listen to what I have to say. Your father, Oceanus, and Malta's mother, Hyperia, are actually brother and sister. - What? - What? - Look over there, in that reflection. In the beginning, both fire and water were in one body. - One body? - It was very long ago. Long before this flame or this sea were here, your parents lived as one. Fire and water, side by side, wrapped in a warm cloud of steam. But Algorac, the Dark Lord of the Winds, grew jealous of their happiness. And so he spread evil rumors, sewing distrust and hatred between brother and sister. Algorac told Oceanus that his sister considered him a coward and a fool. And that Hyperia felt her flames would glow brighter without him. Then, he turned to Hyperia and told her that her brother was planning to douse her flames forever so that the sea would reign supreme on the earth. Both brother and sister believed Algorac's lies. And as their love for each other had been so strong and pure, their bitterness at being betrayed soon grew into a deadly wrath. The Goddess of Fire was inflamed with hate and she rose up into the heavens. And the Lord of the Water shook with fury, and the earth was covered with a terrible storm. The war between brother and sister became a war between son and son, daughter and daughter. Until the families of fire and water slaughtered each other into near oblivion. Then, he who rules over the universe, the greatest lord of all, struck the evil Algorac down and he took Algorac's eye, the source of all his powers. And he imprisoned the Dark Lord of the Winds far beneath the mighty waves, in the lowest depths of the Forbidden Zone. And here Algorac lies, quiet and harmless to this very day. And to prevent this terrible war from starting afresh, a law was made. A law forbidding the children of fire and the children of water from ever showing themselves to each other, you see? Listen, Syrius. In the beginning, fire and water were as one. But now they are things which must be kept forever very far apart. Avoid hatred by avoiding each other. That is the law we must obey. Huh? Huh? The power of love shouldn't be underestimated. And under its spell, laws and rules lose their significance. Syrius, I'm not sure, but there may be a way out of this. - [Both] Huh? - They say that somewhere in the heavens there's a star where fire and water live together. - [Both] A star? - Yes, they say it's a very beautiful star. - Aries Turtle, tell us. How do we get to that star? - You see, there is a very strange phenomenon that happens once every 90 years when the sun hides itself and the earth is covered with darkness. - The sun hides itself? - Just so. No one knows why it happens, exactly. But the fiery chariot of the sun is smothered and the earth is as black as night. Let me see, I can never remember what it's called. The eclipse. Yes, that's it. The day when the black sun appears overhead. - The black sun? - Yes. And when this black sun comes, flaming red rings start to burn around it. And a mysterious flower blooms on the Hills of Elysium between the Kingdom of Fire and the Kingdom of Water. Kalea, these strange flowers are called. And it is said that their blossoms only last for a moment before they burst and fly heavenwards toward that beautiful star. - The Hill of Elysium. - And the Kalea flowers. - Now, if you were to go up to the Hill of Elysium on the day the black sun appears, and find the Kalea flowers, when they burst, they might carry you up into the sky with them. Up to that star where fire and water can live together. - Oh, can it be possible? Syrius, that's our star. - Now, let's see. Tonight there's a new moon overhead. Oh, the eclipse that comes only once every 90 years is due five days from today. - Is that right, Aries Turtle? Only five more days? Did you hear that, Malta? Only five more days and we'll be free to fly to that star. (water splashes) (laughing) - I never would have believed it. - Mugwug. - Consorting with the enemy, are you? I've caught you red-handed. Now we see where you've been going every night. Oh, she's a pretty little fire savage, isn't she, Prince Syrius? And you, you toothless old fool. You should have known better than to enter the Forbidden Zone. I wonder what King Oceanus will think when he hears about this. We'll see. (laughing) - Mugwug, stop! It's not what you think! Stop! - Aries Turtle, wait! Where is the Hill of Elysium? Aries Turtle! - [Malta] Do you think there really is such a place? - [Syrius] I've never known Aries Turtle to be wrong. Come on, we'll find it ourselves if we have to. - [Malta] Oh yes, Syrius. I'll do anything you say. (subdued music) - (gasps) Malta, the flame! It's going out! - Huh? What have I done? - Malta. - What have I done? - Malta, it's all right. - No, no! I let it die. I let the Holy Flame die. - We'll both run away, Malta. We'll go to the Hill of Elysium and find those flowers Aries Turtle talked about. Then we'll go to the star where we can live together forever, Malta. - No, no, it's over. It's finished now. My mother will find out that the Holy Flame has died. Any moment they will come to capture me and they will kill you, Syrius. - Stop it, Malta. - Malta, you must go. You must run away with him and find the flowers that will save you. I will stay here and stop the others. - No, no. - Malta, come on. - Piale. - Hurry up and go before it's too late. Run! Go on! - Piale. Bless you, Piale! When we find the Hill of Elysium, we'll come back for you! (subdued music) - [Piale] Piale loves Malta. I will save you, Malta. I will become the Holy Flame myself, and no one will ever know it went out. - The Holy Flame looks unusually beautiful tonight, Majesty. - Beautiful, indeed. - Why, it looks sadder and lonelier than I've ever seen it before. (tone pulsing) - Piale, what have you done? Go! Find Malta and bring her back to me! (yells) - Are you all right? They found us. (lasers zapping) Come on. - [Malta] I hope Piale is safe. (grunting) - [Syrius] Malta! Malta! (grunting) (rumbling) Oceanus. - Oceanus! So, it was you who stole my daughter from me and killed the Holy Flame! - [Oceanus] I have nothing to say to you. Syrius, tell me. What is the meaning of this? - Great King Oceanus, forgive me. But you must let us go to the Hill of Elysium. - [Oceanus] You, the one I placed all my faith in? I made you King of the Sea. Is this how you repay me? - (laughs) You see, Your majesty? I told you, I told you. - But I love this child of fire! King Oceanus! - [Oceanus] Return to the sea at once! - [Malta] Syrius! - Malta! Are you a daughter of mine? Get away from the water! - [Malta] No, I won't! I can't leave him, I can't! (laughing) - Mugwug, let go of her! - Syrius! - Malta! Malta! (Mugwug laughs) ♪ Malta the Bad, Malta the Wild ♪ ♪ Malta ran off with a Water Child ♪ ♪ Malta the Bad, Malta the Wild ♪ - Malta, my child, you were bewitched by that Water Child. I told you that they are enemies of the flame. - Piale is dead and it's your fault, Malta! You would have betrayed us! - No, I loved him. I loved him. (sobbing) - Malta, your weeping will be over very soon. In a few days, the great eclipse will occur and the black sun will come. - The eclipse? The black sun will come? - Yes. And when it passes, you will be queen. - Mother, I must go to the Hill of Elysium. Syrius will come to meet me there. (Malta yelling) - Malta, my child, forgive me, but you will never set eyes on the Water Child again. (water bubbling) - Oceanus, why have you locked me away in this place? Tell me, great Oceanus! Why is it so wrong to love a child of fire? (grunting) - (laughs) What have we here? On your right, my friends, you see a wild Water Child in a cage. A thrilling sight, isn't it? (laughs) - [Syrius] You'll pay for this! - Don't get too close to the cage, my friends. The animal is very ferocious. (laughing) You should've given me the Eye of Algorac when you had the chance, my boy. Then, you wouldn't be in this mess and I would be king. As I will be anyway. (laughing) (grunting) (panting) (playful music) - Oh, Mother, please let me out. Please. My little friends, thank you. (tones pulsing) - Syrius. You okay, Syrius? - Huh? Oh, Bibble. Any news from the outside world? - Uh-uh, not yet. - And Malta. Have you heard anything about what they've done to her? - Is she really something special? - She's the most special something in the whole world. - Ah. - I'll never see her again. - Now don't start talking like that. I've got it! I'll get you out. I will, Syrius. Don't you worry. (grunting) (saw scraping) (grunting) Now what? (tense music) - Syrius, where is the Hill of Elysium? - [Voice] Oh, what have we here? It's a birdie. - No, it's not a birdie. Use your head. - I agree. I think she's a birdie. - Let's eat her. - If we eat her, we won't be able to find out if she's a bird or not, will we? - Good thinking. - Let's eat her. - [Malta] Please, can you help me? Where is the Hill of Elysium? - Elysium? - It's in the North. - It's in the South. - It's over here. - It doesn't exist. (chattering) - [Malta] Please, help me. Doesn't one of you know where the Hill of Elysium is? - If we tell you where Elysium is, will you let us eat you? - Syrius, where are you? (yells) - Won't you be a good birdie and let us eat you? - Help me, Syrius! - Huh, Syrius? (chattering) - Malta! (subdued music) Malta! Malta! Malta! Malta! Malta! Why won't they let me see you? Malta! Malta. - Hey, I've thought of a way you can break Syrius out of there. - (gasps) Wake up Algorac? - Shh. You steal the eyeball he wears around his neck, find Algorac, and stick it back in his head. Algorac wakes up and goes crazy, smashes up this place, and Syrius escapes. - Algorac will smash up a lot more than this place if he's woken up. - Well, if you ask me, you don't have much choice. You want your buddy Syrius free or not? - All right, I'll do it! (laughing) - Come here, come here. He fell for it. You know what to do? - [All] You can count on us. - What? The Eye of Algorac? - Yeah. All I have to do is stick it back in his head while he's sleeping. Come on, I'm not afraid. - But you can't do that. - Hey listen, you've gotta find your Fire Child, right? How are you ever gonna do that stuck in a place like this? Oh, so that's it. That dumb old eyeball is all that matters to you. All you care about is being king. - No, that's not it at all. I broke the law. I don't deserve to be king. Take the eye, Bibble, and give it back to Great Oceanus. Tell him I'm not worthy of it. Then, maybe he'll let me go from here. Take it. Take it, please. - All right. If you're sure you really want me to, I will. - Take it straight to Oceanus, you hear? - Don't worry, I will. And I'll make him promise to let you go. Hey, Let me go! Hey! (laughs) - It's mine! It's all mine! - [Fish] Now you're the king, master. - [Fish] You'll make a great king, master. - It's enough to make me wanna cry. - [All] Three cheers for our master! - You'll have to call me king from now on, you parasitic pollywogs! - [All] Hooray! Three cheers for our master, the king! - [Mugwug] And now, lets have a party! (cheering) - [Fish] A toast to King Master Mugwug. - And all of you will be my ministers. (cheering) Dance, dance! (laughing) More wine! More wine, more wine! - [Fish] Yeah, here we go. - Drink up. (laughs) Drink up. (laughing) (humming) A vision of beauty. May I have this dance? Huh? Where do you think you're going, huh? (laughs) Why you! - [Bibble] Wee! Bombs away! - Stand Still! Give me back my eyeball! - Some king you'd make. - Huh? - [Creature] Not so fast! Come back here! - I don't wanna talk about it. - Oh, you never wanna talk about anything. - [Both] Huh? - Stop! Where do you think you're going? Don't you know this is the bed chamber of Great King Oceanus himself? - [Bibble] Sure I do. Wake him up. He's gotta see me. - He's got to see you? - Wake him up? (laughing) - What's so funny? Syrius told me to come here and give him the Eye of Algorac. - [Guard] What's that? - [Guard] The Eye of Algorac? - Yeah, here, I'll show you. Oops. Wait. Where'd I put that thing? - This one's gonna be trouble. - Ah, here it is. I told you. - How could a puny little pollywog like you be carrying around the Eye of Algorac? - Be careful, don't lose it. - Now, beat it before we get mad! (yelling) - Ow! All right, be that way. If you won't listen to me, I'll show you what I can do. I'll show them. When Algorac wakes up, they'll be sorry they didn't listen to me. - Ah, my little pearl. Huh? - I've got you now! - Gangway! - Hey, there he goes again. - Huh? - There he goes again. Let's follow him. Let's go. (panting) (gulps) - Maybe I shouldn't be here. What do I do now? I can't just go back. (rumbling) I'd better go back and ask Syrius what to do. - [Both] Oh, look at that! - What is it? - I don't know. (grunting) (yelling) - [Both] Let's get outta here! (grunting) (rumbling) (yelling) (yelling) - Oh, no! Algorac must be awake. Bibble, what have you done? No! (waves crashing) (screeching) (tone pulses) - Syrius. (rumbling) (tone ringing) (rumbling) (tone warbling) (grunts) - Bibble! Bibble! Huh? Bibble! Bibble. (subdued music) Bibble, are you all right? - Syrius, you did get out of prison after all. - Yes, here I am, and I couldn't have done it without you. - I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise to you. I wasn't able to get the Eye of Algorac to King Oceanus. - That's all right, Bibble. Don't worry about it. I'm sure Oceanus will understand. Now, let's take care of you. - No, Syrius. Forget about me. You've got lots of things to do, remember? It's no use. - What do you mean forget about you? What do you mean it's no use? Bibble, stop it. You can't talk like that. - You have to find your Fire Child, and the Hill of Elysium, and the flowers that will take you away. - We'll wait 'till you're better, then you can go, too. We'll take you with us. - Syrius? - What is it? - Promise me one thing. When you find the star where fire and water can live together, promise you won't forget me. - I'll remember you as long as I live. - That makes me happy. Because now, you see, I know that I'll be with you there forever. - Don't die, Bibble. Please, don't die. - Here, take this. I won't need it now, and it's all that I have to give. (gasps) (subdued music) - [Syrius] Bibble! (crying) Bibble. Bibble. Why did you have to die? Why did you have to die? (tone warbling) - Huh? The Kalea flowers. The sun. Beautiful. They're so beautiful flying up to the sun. Flying up to the sun! Syrius! Syrius, hurry! Syrius. The flowers, they're flying away! They're flying up to our star! Syrius, hurry! Oh, no. They're leaving without us! Hurry, before they're all gone! No, stop! Don't go! Wait for us, please! Wait! Don't go yet. Syrius will be here any moment. He will be, I know it. He's always kept his word to me. Oh, Syrius. Syrius, where are you? (plants creaking) It's all over now. The Water Child lied to me. Syrius will never come. (tone pulsing) (chimes clinking) - Malta! Whoa! Malta! Malta! Malta! Malta, where are you? I can't. (subdued music) Malta. - [Voices] It's the Water Child! The Water Child! - Malta. (gasps) Malta. - Syrius. - [Syrius] Malta, where are you? Answer me. - It is he, but the eclipse is over. - Malta. Malta. - I waited for you. I thought you would come. But you didn't, and now it's too late. - Malta, I know you're there. - Water Child, do not call my name. - Malta, why don't you answer? Where are you? (groaning) - The sun! Go back, the sun! - Malta, there you are! I hear you! I'm coming to you! I'm coming to you! - Go back! Stay out of the sun! It will kill you, Syrius! (grunts) I... I... (yelling) (gasps) (tense music) (yelling) - Oh, Syrius. Syrius. What have I done? It's too late now. Too late. No, don't die. Syrius. Take me with you. (Malta sobbing) (subdued music) Don't touch me! Syrius, I will join you. I will carry you back to your home, the water. And as you have died in the sun, I shall die in the sea. We will never be separated. Never again. (dramatic music) (chimes clinking) - Malta, forgive me, my daughter. (waves crashing) (gasps) - [Oceanus] Behold. Were all our troubles caused by the love of these two or by the hatred of others? In the beginning, fire and water were as one. Perhaps you two can create a new world, such as ours was long, long ago. Now fly, my children. Fly up to your star, and live forever in happiness. (dramatic orchestral music) - So, there you have it. Syrius and Malta floated away and were never seen on earth again. They may be gone, but they're certainly not forgotten. Every time we look up into the dark heavens, we can be reminded of their undying love for each other. For up there, twinkling in the blackness, is the star where fire and water live together as one. Needless to say, they are living happily ever after. I often wonder, when I think of Syrius and Malta waving at us from that faraway star, how many other pairs of star-crossed lovers might be up there shining guiding lights for us in the nighttime sky. (soft orchestral music)
