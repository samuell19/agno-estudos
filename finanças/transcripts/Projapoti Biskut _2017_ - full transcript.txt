You’re involved with progressive culture … … And yet you’re putting Kartik in front of houses? No no… what do you mean it was a joke? How can everything be a joke? And Shaon insisted on doing the rituals. You know my mother. Imagine my situation! Ma is pretty upset. Actually, our family’s culture is a little different. A communist environment … - Phone. - Yes. Can you take a leave tomorrow? Leave? Why'll I take a leave? But again … I might. Tomorrow we shall bid bye to Kartik. When the Lord has come by himself … He'd have been angry if we didn’t take him in. Understand Mr. Environment? Hail Murugan! Hail Murugan! Listen … he is calling us muggers! Not muggers … he is saying Murugan. Like the Tamils call him Murugan … - … We call him Kartik. - Oh. Brother, please take the second Hoogly bridge. What? Aren’t we going to immerse it?

Leave it … it’s channel’s headache. Let them deal with it. I'll break the hero's leg one day. Rating would nose-dive. Don’t get mad with Ujaan, Pari. All that labour pain … to create to him. Dear Mommy! Wait. You wrote 3 plots in September, right? So, Rs. 3000 for 3 plots. And 12 scenes … right? Rs. 6500. Listen listen… now that Ujaan is in bed… … Should we increase Rai’s role?

What're you doing here? Watching a very important episode here… They’re catching Russian bears and shaving off the fur. And they are making blazers and gloves with that fur. Further global problem! Nothing about our house interests our younger daughter-in-law… But I am glad that her habit of watching soaps has influenced you. No, no . No influence. Quiet! But your younger daughter-in-law has a heart of gold. No complication… Some sophistication would've helped. Just because Babusona was so smitten by her photograph. Such an uncultured family! Keep it low… there are people around. Asha Bhosle is her favourite Rabindra Sangeet singer! It's my fault … I should've guessed it then. This is not right Asha… Now, don't side with her. Keep quiet! Otherwise I’ll shave off your head! Hello! Bonny? Listen to what your father did. Such tantrums he was throwing after returning from office. Hold on a sec darling. He lost his pajamas apparently. You know how your father talks? Yes Ma. And then he got some catfish from the market. Have to cook it for him right then. Your father loves it. You know that, right? Then we found out that … … He wore the trousers over his pajama and went to office. Did you hear me? Yes Ma… To add to the chaos your sis has brought home two bunnies. They are simply eating and pooping. You know how dirty bunnies can be. Yes Ma. Hey… why are you saying 'yes yes' continuously? Why did you call? Just a routine call. Bonny … are you okay my love? Yes Ma. Are you upset? No… nothing… just like that. Heart… heart is the main issue. Heart is stonger than hormone. Tiff with wife? What do I say Niyogi da? I don’t understand… and she is the quiet type. - Hardly speaks. - This surely is depression. The deep pit in our psyche … … Is the root of all problems. - Don’t worry, I’ll refer you to Pakrashi. - Pakrashi? Psychologist… very well known. He can literally peep into your soul. Donation please! Give something in the name of your grandson. Hey smarty… where are you going on a car? Won’t you give something to your aunt? Hey what are you doing here loser? Give your aunt some money. Make it fast. May you have a son… bless you. Thank you again… ok. That’s it… all arranged. Don’t think I am a middleman, because I sat in the middle.

Actually… we were trying to… Do you know what is more crucial than being a Ma? What? Trauma! Some secret from your childhood. Some secret incident … … Something … … Which has ruined your childhood. For example… … In the attic … … One day, suddenly … … Your younger maternal uncle grabs you from behind. What? Never! May not be in reality, but he could have. Remember … the main factor in life is … … Stress! And … trauma! As if they are brother … sister! Hey, why are you constantly tickling me? Isn’t it irritating? Ummm… sorry. Excuse me… … Listening to so many patients since morning… … What a stressful profession! You rather sit here! Don’t be so stressed out. Go to a shrink yourself.

There was another man… … Looked a little like a ripe mango… … Like an old Calcutta Baboo... … Was doddering with a stick. Yes… he is our grandfather from Jamshedpur. - Grandfather! - Yes. How is he now? A year back … died. Passed away! How fortunate! Tell me… does your mother still sing Tagore songs? Yes. Does she sing on makeshift stage? - What? - Open air… open air. Didn’t I ask you not to bother him? Blabbering him to boredom! Brought sweets again dear? How are you? Take this… Are you ok? How will I stay ok dear? Just day before yesterday I was walking up the stairs… … And suddenly I sprained my right knee. That day he got some cat fish. I made some spicy curry with that. Such stomach upset the next day. His hand was not even drying. To top it all, I can’t even sleep properly. Your father-in-law snores so loudly… … You'll think there’s a bike race going on a mile away. I’ve never heard anything like that! Quiet! If one can’t sleep at night… Is it possible to keep well? Eat it up! Don’t bore him with your blabber. Driving everyone mad! What a motormouth! Doesn't help around the house. Go ahead… eat. - May I tell you something? - Please. After a certain time of marriage… … Whatever you say, will irritate your wife. Eat it up. My daughter … … Looks exactly like her mother. How fortunate! Looks and words… just the same! How very fortunate! Look at them sis. What have you done to your hair Bonny! Ouch! Now that you have done Kartik Puja… … When do we get to see the child? Don’t worry so much. I've been keeping a fast every month now. Everything will be ok.

He didn't mind. How fortunate! Please eat. Hello… We're jacked! - What? - Hiya is pregnant! You're looking for Jack? Mom… that must be for me. Looking for some Jack or Mack. God! You have no sense of time. Sorry sorry… How would I know? Who calls this early in the morning? Whatever … Hiya is pregnant. How's that possible? They didn’t even spend a night together. Just some rituals made her pregnant? Disgusting! Her mom-in-law doesn't allow them to stay together. Forget it. Think of a solution. Please give a child, Bonny! But people will not accept that Pari. We don’t know what will they accept or not. But do something… say something… please! What could I? At such a short notice! But do something … please! You can do one thing. Kill off the mother-in-law. Then, by some supernatural means, she'll be in Hiya's womb. This is why I love you so much. You’re a pregnancy specialist. I swear … these people are crazy! That's not the way to have a baby, hard to stomach! It is all about the stomach, you see… You’re such an adamant fellow! I warned you so many times… … Do not bless her… do not bless her. You still went ahead? Sorry Sir… What sorry? Out of nowhere… there’s an ill… ill… - Illegitimate. - Yes … I know. Can you imagine what soup you’re in? Won’t happen again sir. What won’t happen again?

It’s a mistake… sorry sir… actually slip of tongue… Tongue? What? I’m not at fault, sir. Mr Goody Two-shoes! Huh! This is why the saying goes… … All the faults are for the ba*** Niyogi da… I don’t think that’s really a saying. Yes… I know. - Have a little more chicken. - No mom. - Then have a little more rice. - I'm pretty full. Why are you forcing her? Eat more Strength more. She's like my daughter. Can't I force her? Shaon… Anondi needs a brother now. Brother? When is he coming? He is packing now… Will arrive in a few days. Dad you aren’t saying anything. Why beg your brother for a brother? When you can arrange for, one by yourself. Dad… you’re an incorrigible species. How can you talk so much rubbish!

Can you get out at once? Parijat Mukherjee! Can you come here? We are in a crisis! Adoption? Have you thought about what you’re doing? Yes Dad. Nobody has ever adopted in this family before. And after this, if you have your own child? Will you be able to treat them equally? Yes, we will. How much experience do you have about life? How long have you even been married? We've never really pressurized you for anything. Dad… this is our wish. Wish! You wish to bring an unknown child… Mom… do you have the Tagore poem collection? Oh… sorry… sorry. It’s your life… your decision. We are your parents. Can't leave you in lurch. Do whatever you seem fit. I had warned you! Not to take that Kartik idol inside the house. I don’t think Mom-Dad want this. Do you want it? Yes… I want it… again… You don’t want it… right? No… did I say that? Not in so many words. Since the decision was mine, you kind of agreed. Isn’t so? Shaon… you’re my wife. Whenever… whatever that you’ve wished for… I’ve always stood by it… Out of pressure, maybe. Do you really love me this much? If yes, then … … Why did you connect with your Ex on Facebook? Me… that… Shaon… that… I need someone in this house. Who is going to be mine alone. What will you name him if it’s a boy? Boy?

Bye. Hello… Antor… I don't call you Dear You don't call me back Waterfall is glistening like silver I don't call you Dear You don't call me back Waterfall is glistening like silver Beyond any metaphor The bank of water Beyond any metaphor The bank of water Caresses with its finger As if combing your hair See, I have decorated it.

Will let you know. I’ll call. I am totally clueless... Anondi said that she has seen her leave with bags. Call your in-laws and check. If she isn't there, they'll get tensed up. Doesn’t she have friends? Friend… even Parijat’s number is unavailable. Wait… I’ll call your in-laws and try and figure out. But, if that creates a problem… What is left of a problem? How fortunate! So when are you coming? She has been sleeping ever since she came. She is sleeping like a log, as if she had night duty. What? You couldn’t connect the call last night? How fortunate! No, sorry. That’s not how things work, Babusona. Without sugar. You bring her back today. Even I can come along, if necessary. Should I serve your breakfast? She wants to be left alone for a while. Wow! Left alone! How nice! Why did she get married at all? Ah! Asha! Please! You don’t interrupt. It has reached this point because I kept mum. Let me speak today. Look here… see how the fishes have grown! Hey… look here. If this were my wife… …I would've dragged her back home. Leaving without notice! What nuisance! This is all because of your timid nature. If she were my wife I'd thrash… But, Niyogi da! Shaon isn’t your wife. She’s my wife. Then pamper her. Pamper her whims. Never heard of such a situation! You better look into my transfer. Are you serious? You’ll leave the ground? I understand. We’ll talk about this tomorrow. See you. Hey, Antor! Your phone. All of us who look distressed Guarding with life But failing nonetheless Love eludes us all. Her shape is of a ray of light Mostly she stays alone all night No one knows the reasons right But loves eludes us all. Bless you, little heart! Bless you! Bless you, little heart! Bless you! We live amidst paints and brushes And bags of dreams We live amidst paints and brushes And bags of dreams We hope to die in an instant Only if she’s seen All of us who took the blame We’re playing but a losing game Every move results the same And love eludes us all. Bless you, little heart! Bless you! Bless you, little heart! Bless you! Cameras and facades everyday Masquerading as faces in a way Cameras and facades everyday Masquerading as faces in a way Shivering like a droplet on a leaf You make me wait for a word to keep All of us who look distressed Guarding with life But failing nonetheless Love eludes us all. Bless you, little heart! Bless you! Bless you, little heart! Bless you! Bless you, little heart! Bless you! She wants to stay back a few more days. She's a very docile girl. Let her stay… right? She can't lead a family life if she doesn't want to. Even marriage has some discipline. No ma’am… it isn’t like that. Our daughter is very disciplined since her childhood. A bit crazy one can say. By mad I mean very talented. She sings Asha Bhosle songs so well. That one… 'Let me go, don’t call back' 'Your eyes say so much' … Tears come to eyes listening her songs. Have the sweets. You better talk to her. But I really don’t think it’ll work. If a relationship dries up… What’s the point watering it? You tell me? Water… I’m thirsty indeed. You could’ve called once. I did… couldn’t get through. Let bygones be bygones. Come back Shaon. The crisis is mine alone. Let me deal with it by myself. You really won’t come back? Then tell me what do you want. Honestly? Will you take me out for beer once? Will you? For beer? Disgusting! And me? Same to you! Better to be alone than in bad company. Now the question is… … How long have they been separated? Around 3 months. Let it be for 3 months more. After that we can send a legal notice. Have some snacks. I can’t bring myself to eat, brother. I can’t look at my son. After his break-up… … I arranged for this marriage. Now the question is… - … Is there any glue? - Glue? Glue in their relationship. If there is… then all will be fine. A relationship is like this snack. Once broken … gone! I warned you not to hang around with those scoundrels. With those scoundrels? I didn’t mom… believe me. - Now you’re lying… - Leave me Ma. Then how dare he sends these filthy messages? Tell me! Speak out! I don’t know. If he sends me messages what can I do? You dare lie to me again! - I’ll kill you today! - Leave her Ma… leave her! Ask your talented sister… … What all she’s doing secretly. No studying… nothing. Leave her! Don’t talk like that… Of course I can! You can’t hit a grown up girl. Don’t you dare interfere in all this. You’re a guest! Stay, eat and then leave! Don't forget! This is my family! Understand? Stop bothering about your sister and mind your own business. That rude mother-in-law of yours… … Has given us a mouthful, because of you. Do you hear me? With whom you've chopped off your hair… … Whom are you going around with… Have we asked? I will kill you! Is it good? Yuck! Disgusting! Have a sip. Isn’t it disgusting? No… Will you have more? Of course, yes! You’ll have it even if you don't like it? Exactly! Why're you so worried about rent? Is it for you? Yeah. I’ll borrow a little from you… … Later I’ll return it by writing scripts. Won’t you be scared, staying alone? What’s there to be scared of? When you were in Bangalore… … I used to stay here alone. I'm used to it. But I've grown a bad habit of staying together. All bad habits are … … Disgusting! Change it. And you take this. What have you got? Have a look. 17th August is here again. May we stay together on that day? We may… … If you take me on a trip. Where? A place from where we can see a huge ship. Can you? Bonny! Whom do you hang around these days? You come back so late! Couldn't care less … I guess! May I touch your feet Ma? What nonsense is this? I want to touch both your feet. Bonny! I just wish to lie at your feet. After all you are my birth giver! My birth giver… motherland… Ma! You reek of alcohol. I’ll not tolerate all this, I warn you! You’ve cut your hair like a man. I’ll tell our son-in-law everything. The smell is very fishy… right Ma? What happened? Daddy… you are our Father, right? And Ma thinks I am fishy. Being a girl she's returning home drunk. Why can’t I drink? Because I am a girl? For a couple of beers, I have to get my sex changed? How will that help you? She is surely in very bad company. If she suddenly elopes, how'll we face the relatives? Elope! How fortunate! Sadananda! Take out the car… … I have to go to the recording. - Tata! - Hang on! What tiffin did you take, poha pulao or noodles? Nothing today… … Street snacks only! Diamond Harbour! I’ll open the windows. To the loo. You first? Hmm… Go ahead… Beer? One more? I’ll have it? Cheers! Have it… have it. Cheers! May I say something? Yes. Come back with me Shaon. Where? To your home. Your home is my home… I don’t have a home Antor. Where should I go? It is your room as well. I was really addicted to cigarettes back in college. Every morning I’d have a smoke in the toilet. After marriage I did smoke once secretly. Then I became a wife and had to quit smoking. I was born during the monsoon … … To an ordinary family. So my parents came up with an ordinary name. Sraboni. May be it’s not as classy as Shaon… … But … that was my name, Antor. After marriage, even that changed. Shaon Sen. The name was so stylish! But you know… being a married woman… … I couldn’t continue wearing jeans. But, I do like wearing short tops. I like watching TV soaps … … Listening to hindi songs. I even like to worship and perform rituals. I am like this. May be I am the jealous type… … The drama queen… … The spoilt brat… but I am like this. The girl who lived in your Bhawanipur house… That girl wasn’t me. She was the decent, graceful, made-up daughter-in-law. I really wanted the baby. But you know … … A child wouldn't have been the solution. I know that. I’m not as nice as you, Antor. I’m just like what I am. You’re much decent. And I’m… disgusting! But you know I’m very happy with myself. I want a room like this for myself. Where I can be … Open the door! I’ll check! Arrest them! Sir! Sit quietly! Everyone claims to be married when caught. Have you ever heard of this … … That a man plays hanky panky with one's wife in a shady hotel? Sir! Ok… now go there for bail. Sir… Go… what are you waiting for? What a fix! But we’re married. Married? Huh! Can you see the parade of married couples? Sir, please believe me. He's my husband. But to believe you, I need some signs. No signs of a married lady on you. How can I believe you? Nobody wears them anymore. Really? Then get your marriage certificate. Where'll we get the marriage certificate here? Bring it from wherever it is. Sir… Hey… stop that or else I’ll get a stick up your ar**! Rascal! Shut up! Bring it! Fast! Next! Hey… is this your first time? Hello… Dadabhai… are you busy? We are in a bit of a trouble. Can you come down once? Diamond Harbour. Are you sure you don't need lift any farther? You carry on. Ok. - Happy Anniversary, Shaon! - Thanks. - Bye. - Happy Anniversary! Let’s go. I’ve been transferred to Bhilai. Leaving day after tomorrow. Can I meet you once before I leave? Keep it with you. You’ll misplace it again. Thanks. Why are you leaving? Just like that. I don’t like Kolkata anymore. Did you know this would happen? Yeah. Why didn’t you tell me? Just like that. Will you be able to manage all by yourself? Yeah… I’m sure I’ll manage something. Was thinking of employing a part time maid. Oh! So what'll she do? The usual household chores. And me? Before leaving, won't you give me anything? Shaon! What'll you give me? Will you go? Will you really go away with me? First, tell me what'll you give me. Palmier puff… a huge ship and… And? Aloklata. Hold me tightly Antor, I'm scared. May I say something? Yes. Do you love me? Nope… you’re disgusting! And you? I love the little girl… or may be not. Even love is like a child, Antor. Who has hands… eyes… heart. Does it have a name? Yes… certainly! Amour!
