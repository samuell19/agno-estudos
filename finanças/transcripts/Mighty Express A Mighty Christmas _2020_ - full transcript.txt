Nice job, everyone. Now let's set up the spot for the Christmas tree. -[train horn] -Huh? [funky music] Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Mandy Mail, the best mail delivery train in town! If you need anything delivered, I'm your train! Mandy is the newest member of the Mighty Express. And this is her mail carrier pigeon friend, Flap! [coos] [all] Hiya! Welcome to the team! -[comm alert] -Carrie to Max! Hi, Carrie! I need help with a delivery at Mail Station. Could you send a train? I've got it! Super-special, extra-important delivery coming right up! [Flap] Woo-hoo! [train bell] Dear Santa, for Christmas I would love a special delivery of an orange-and-green soccer ball. That would be first class. Love, Carrie. Signed and sealed! Now to deliver all of these letters to Santa at the North Pole. [train whistle] Hi! You must be Carrie! You must be Mandy Mail. I'm so glad you're here! Well, I am the best. So where's this super-special, extra-important delivery you've got for me? Right here! Mail?! [scoffs] I mean, I've delivered mail before. That doesn't seem very important. Oh! Every letter is important, especially... [alarm] Uh-oh! Another delivery! Gotta go! Thanks, Mandy! So much for something super special and extra important. [sighs] [squawks] [gasps] The town Christmas tree! Now that is an important delivery! Perfect for me! [squawks] I mean, for us. Make way for Mandy Mail!

OK, let's light this tree up. Making the switch! -Wow! -Woo! Wow! Wow! It's beautiful! And I'm the one who delivered it! Oh. [cheering] [whines] And now it's almost time for the best part of Christmas! Presents? No. The big town party! And then... Santa comes! I sent a letter to Santa asking for a new bike. [barks] Um, why does Diesel have my letter? Uh, Mandy? Weren't you supposed to deliver these letters to Santa? I... uh... um... uh... If Santa doesn't get our letters, the kids in Tracksville won't get presents! We have to get these letters to the North Pole right away! Calling all trains! Please report to the Busy Board for today's Mega Mission! It's Mighty Time! [train horn] [distant train horn] [sirens] [train horn] Today's Mega Mission goes to... our newest team member, Mandy Mail! What? Really?! Everybody deserves a second chance. Delivering mail is what you do best, Mandy. You'll go back and pick up the letters to Santa at Mail Station, then deliver them to the North Pole as fast as you can! Mandy Mail never fails! I guess delivering the letters to Santa is super special and extra important.

I will save Christmas! Now you're ready to... [all] Make tracks! [buzzer] Make way for Mandy Mail! [train horn] [train bell] [grunts] I don't know if all these letters will fit! I think you need another train to help you. Help? No, no, no, no, no! I can save Christmas all on my own! But this is a lot of mail, Mandy. I don't want any letters falling out. Let me see if Max can send someone to help. Hi, Max! We need another train to help us cos there's a lot of mail here. I'll send Freight Nate. He loves to haul big loads. And Nico will come too, in case there are any problems with the track. [grunts] Come on... Close! [squawks] See? There! Don't need any help. Bye! Mandy! Don't you want to wait for Nate and Nico? [train whistle] [train horn] We made it here fast, fast, faster! But Mandy already left and she has too much mail to carry by herself! Oh, no! This is a Christmas calamity! Let's catch up to Mandy and help! Come in, Mandy. Nate and Nico are on their way to help! No, no, no. I'm good. I can do it by myself! [coos] I'm going to be the one to save the super-special, extra-important Christmas delivery. Mandy Mail never fails! [dramatic music] Whew! It's getting chilly! I'd better go faster to warm us up. [both] Mandy! Slow down! [gasps] Whoa! [grunts] I never thought I'd say this, but I need... -Help! -[Flap squawks] Nate! Don't worry, Mandy, we'll save you! [Mandy] Hurry! Mega grappling claw, activate! -Oh! -[Nico] Ah! Mega-stabiliser legs, activate! Careful, Nate. According to my calculations, the ice we're on might... break! I've got this! Thanks for helping me! No problem! The Mighty Express is always ready to help! That's what you call teamwork! [train bell] By the way, you dropped some letters. Oh, no! I'm sorry. You know what? I could use a little help with this delivery. Happy to be of service! Let's get these letters to Santa! Chugga-chugga zoom! [train bell] [festive music] Approaching North Pole Station! Wow, look! Santa's Workshop! [festive music] Whoa! Ho, ho, ho! Hello, Nico, Mandy, Flap and Nate! According to my calculations, it's Santa! The real Santa! And he knows our names! We've got a special delivery for you, Santa. Thanks to some help from Nate, done and delivered! What's all this? Letters from the kids in Tracksville telling you what they'd like for Christmas! Hmm. Is that a good "hmm" or a bad "hmm?" Well, I'm afraid it's not good. It's too late to make any more presents. It's time to make our deliveries! And there's a storm brewing! [thunder rumbles] We need to head out soon or we'll get caught in it! But we came all this way! And the kids worked so hard on their letters! And now they won't get presents? I ruined Christmas! [coos sadly] There, there. You didn't ruin Christmas, Mandy. Christmas is about so much more than presents. Yeah. Like getting together with your family and friends. Friends! That's it! What if we got our friends to come and help make presents for the kids? Well, we do have a little time. With some help, we could make the toys we need. Ha! Even Santa needs a little extra help sometimes. Ho, ho, ho! OK, Mandy to Max. Come in, Max! There you are! Are you all right? Yup! We got to the North Pole, but we've got a lot of presents to make. According to my calculations, it's gonna take a really long time! We need your help! We're on our way with Brock, Milo and Flicker. [train bell] Ho, ho, ho! This is where we make all the toys! This place is amazing! Thanks! I designed it myself. Tinsel-tastic, isn't it?! I hope help gets here soon! -[train horn] -[gasps] [train whistle, horns] -We made it! -Hi, Santa! -Ho, ho, ho! Hello! -Thanks for coming. Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh! Santa! I'm a big fan! It's good to see you, too, Milo! I'm so glad you're all here! We have to hurry if we want to finish the toys before the storm hits! What's my job? Mandy, you're in charge of wrapping the gifts. We brought your wrapping car. Wrapping?! But what about making toys? I thought I'd get an important job. You know, Mandy, when you're part of a team, every job is important. All right, Santa. Then I'll be the best gift-wrapper who ever wrapped! I'll be a wrap star! [chuckles] That's the spirit! Now let's ho, ho, go! Before that storm gets here!

Now we just have to deliver them. Great! See you soon! Over and out. [thunder rumbles] [Santa] I don't like the look of those clouds. Let's load up the sleigh so I can ho, ho, go before the storm hits. That's all the presents! Checkity-check! Let's hook up the reindeer! [hooves clattering] -[wind whistles] -[shivers] Oh, no! The reindeer can't take off in this weather. Does that mean no one will get Christmas presents this year? I'm afraid not, Brock. If the reindeer can't pull the sleigh then... [triumphant music] I can do it! Uh, I mean... we can do it! We're made of metal and strong enough to get through all that ice and wind! We might need even more help. Calling all trains! Please report to the North Pole. Let's haul, y'all! Rescue Red to the rescue! Penny, set, go! [train bell] This is so exciting! Ho, ho, ho! Thanks for your help, everyone. OK, Nico, where to first? Our first delivery is to Bat Cave Tunnel to deliver these hats. Then on, Red! On, Flicker! On, Penny! On, Milo! On, Mandy! On, Brock! On, Nate! And on, Faye! And away we go! Ho, ho, ho! [train bell] [Jubilee] Come in, Max. It's almost time for the Christmas party to start. How's it going? Well, we made it through the worst of the storm but now we have to make the deliveries. And then we'll get there as fast as we can! OK! See you soon! Over and out. [Max] Bat Cave Tunnel straight ahead. Let's ho, ho, go! [chattering] Merry Christmas, my bat friends! Ho, ho, ho, ho! [squawks] -Here you go! -Here you go! -There you are! -Come and get 'em! -[Liza] Here you go! -[Max] Here you are! That'll keep 'em warm. Now, let's deliver the rest of these presents. [brakes screeching] Oh, no! The storm got even worse! We're snowed in! But we have to get these presents to the kids! [squawks] It's OK, Flap. There's gotta be another way out of here. [gasps] Look! Up there! Yeah! But, uh, we'd have to fly! [gasps] Excellent idea, Penny! Um, Santa? According to my calculations, trains can't fly. Let's see about that. Ho, ho, ho! I can use the same magic that makes my reindeer fly. I'm not sure it'll work on trains, but I ho-ho-hope it does! Who wants to try first? -Me, me, me! -All right, Mandy. Now, get ready to... fly! [blows] Or not. [gasps, giggles] I'm flying?! Yippee! All right! Ho, ho, ho! Who's next?! [all] Me! Me! Me! [blows] [train horn] [train bell] [hoots] [chatters] [mooing] [squeaking] Where to now, Max? Central Square Station! Well, it's getting late. I guess we'll just have to start the Christmas party without everyone. No presents? It's the end of the world! -Aw. -[kids] Aw! [train horns] I hear trains! But where are they? They're up! Wow! -Ho! Ho! Ho! -Woo-hoo! -All right! -Hooray! This is a super-special, extra-important Christmas delivery! [gasps] Santa? Ho, ho, ho! Santa! [cheering] Sorry we're late, Jubilee. I'm just glad you made it! The Christmas party wouldn't have been the same without you. Mighty Express saved Christmas! [cheering] Ho, ho, ho!
