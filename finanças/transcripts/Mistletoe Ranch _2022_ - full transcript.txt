["Christmas Day Dreaming" by Tony Osbourne plays] -[man] Alright, take that, thank you, over there. -[man] Come on, straight throug. Let's go. Are you good? -[Aimée] Is he here yet? No. I'll give him a call first thing. I'm so sorry. It's alright. Thank you. -[man] Make-up? Keep it moving. Come on. Let's go. Thank you so much. Can someone give me a muffin? I am so hungry right now. But none of the carrot stuff. I don't like carrots. Give me something else. I thought Gustav was going to be the photographer for the shoot. The great Gustav is indisposed. [huffs] -[Aimée] Micha? I don't think he's going to show. Uh-uh. No, not again. I'm just his assistant. You're Gustav's talented assistant. Please, Aimée? Fine. I'm gonna pick up a lens and could we get those lights up? And just tone it down in her lips. Thank you. [Micah claps sharply] People! We're a go. [camera shutter clicks and snaps] Gorgeous. Yep. There. Nice. OK. Picture you are on stage at the Palais Garnier and you are performing in front of the crème de la crme of the city. Simply just holding that moment in between the curtain falling and the applause. Great. OK. [shutter beeps] Yeah. -[Shutter clicks] -Gorgeous. Nice. Just hold that one there. Alright. -Exquisite, Madeleine. -[shutter clicks] -You're a ballerina whisperer. -[Aimée chuckles] Any other skills you'd like to share with us? Oui. I have been able to ride a horse since I was five. Ooh, cosmopolitan and practical. [both chuckle] Paris and New York via Mistletoe Ranch. -[snow crunches underfoot] -[horses whinny] [bolt rattles] [door creaks] [horse whinnies] Belle, hey. [Belle neighs] -How are you? -[Belle snorts] It's OK. Ready to work? [Belle whinnies] -[woman] Aimée? Great job today. -You too. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -[Micha] You know, I heard a rumour... Mmm? ...about extraordinary assistant who stepped in during Gustav's shoot in Moscow. That was one time. And it happened again in Paris. And Singapore. And Sydney. You know Gustav will take the credit for this too. He always does. I'm his personal assistant, OK? I'm stuck here for life. [chuckles] But you, Aimée, you were supposed to do a one year apprenticeship but you're still here doing his work for him. Might be time you escaped his shadow. Well, the last few years have certainly been an adventure. I just wish Gustav shot on film or at least tried medium format like Irene Vore. She's a recluse. And the most in-demand photographer of her generation. [scoffs] Yeah. I mean, if you can find her. You heading home for the holidays? Gustav wants me to fly to Iceland after Christmas so it's just easier to stay in the city. Well, you'll be pretty lonely if you're staying around here. Mmm. Everyone's going home for the holidays. You too? As soon as we are done I'm heading straight to the airport. I've got one photo shoot in Rome and then I'm having an Italian Christmas. --Ooh! -Yeah, cheese, pasta, wine. -[woman] Hey, Aimée? -Hey. -I have a delivery for you. -Thank you. I get them to hold my mail. You can't find a mailbox in the Himalayas. -Aimée, are you Santa? -[Aimée laughs] -[Aimée] It's from my hometown, Snowy Oak. -[Micha] Are they from everyone in Snowy Oak? Pretty much. [edgy music] What? He's cancelling the Christmas party. Why would he cancel it? -Who? -James. James Hunt. [girl giggles] Juniper? [giggles] [Belle neighs and snorts] -[Juniper giggles] -Junbug, is that you? Huh. Thought I heard something. -[Juniper giggles] -That's because I did! [Juniper giggles] -[Juniper] Dad, I nearly dropped my cookie. -[James] Oh good, more sugar. -Grandma made them. -Yep. Anyway, it's Christmas. Nope, not yet it's not. You should go get changed. You've worn those wings like, every day. But Dad, Mum said I'm a Christmas fairy. Can I still be a Christmas fairy if you you've cancelled Christmas? Am I just a regular fairy now? Juniper, I have not cancelled Christmas. I have cancelled the Christmas party. OK? What about Christmas tree? You'll have one with your mum. Mum is on tour. She isn't back until Christmas Day, remember? Of course I remember. But your grandma's sure to have a big old Christmas tree at church. -[horse snorts] -Rude. [giggles] So, what about the big house? Junbug, how many times have I told you? The big house isn't ours, it's Aimée's. But Aimée's not even here. I've never even met her. Well, that's because Aimée is busy away working. But when Aimée was a little girl like you, she lived in the big house with her mum, Molly. And when Molly passed away she left it to Aimée. Would Aimée like a Christmas tree, do you think? Aimée likes Christmas even more than you do. -No. -Mm-hm. -She does not. -Yeah. -I love Christmas more. -[James chuckles] I wish Aimée was here then. I bet she'd get a Christmas tree. That she would. And then she'd kill me. I'm going to kill him. This is very dramatic. I mean, I'm all for other people's family drama, don't get me wrong. But didn't you say you haven't been home for like-- Three years. But James tends to avoid me anyway so I think the last time I saw him was... Ahh. No, I know that look. That's the look I had when I realised my ex was going to be at the same New Year's Eve party as me. You and this James character have history. Don't you? Sort of but that is not the point. The point is that he cancelled Christmas. Snowy Oak was a tired ranching town before my family created the Christmas party. And it's not just a party, it's the one time of year the whole town comes together. It's really important. And now I have a whole bag of letters to prove it. Sorry, Micha, I have to go. -[Micha] Forgetting something? -Huh? Oh. -Aimée. -[Aimée chuckles] -Good luck. -Merry Christmas, Micha. Merry Christmas, Aimée. [train horn sounds] [gentle music with sleigh bells ringing] [train horn blasts] [birds caw] [gentle music] [exhales] [strains] [keys jangle] [door unlocks and creaks open] Hello? [boots thump on floorboards] [keys jangle and clatter onto table] [birds chirp and caw outside] [gentle music] [discordant chord] Hey, Mum. [gentle music continues] [horse whinnies outside] [clattering from outside] [approaching footsteps] -[Aimée] Excuse me. Where can I find James? Pardon me, miss, but who are you? -Oh, I'm-- -He's out at the stockyards. Perfect. Thank you. Hey! What do you think you're doing? You don't want to be getting lost out there. If that's who I think it is, she'll be fine. [Horse whinnies] -[Aimée] James Hunt, why did you cancel the Christmas party? -Oh, hi, Aimée. Been a long time. How are you doing? Oh, me? I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking. -Really? -Yeah. James, it's tradition. Why did you cancel it? I did not cancel Christmas. I cancelled a Christmas party. -My mother's Christmas party? -Yep. An annual event? The highlight of the year for Snowy Oak? James, come on, it's the most magical, exciting, enchanting Christmas celebration. Which has been held uninterrupted since 1929. The one you haven't been to in years. That one. Well, that's completely irrelevant. No, you're the one who came all the way out here to yell at me. I think it's entirely relevant. Look, I don't have to attend to know it's important, James. Christmas is the one time of year magic's allowed to happen. -[bolt locks] -Well, magic's expensive. Then we can tone down the glitter. Look, James, I know the ranch had its run of bad luck but we could get a tree or some carol singers. There's no money, Aimée. It's more than just a run of bad luck. OK. What about another bank loan? Bank won't lend us any money until we've made up the already late payments. Why didn't you tell me any of this? I did. I emailed you. You should have called me. Look, I am sorry, Aimée. I cancelled the Christmas party because it seemed like the right thing to do. This isn't over. OK? I'm gonna take Holly back to the stables and-- It's Belle. Wait, what happened to Holly? Holly was an old horse when you left. It's Belle. A lot's changed. Come on. [Belle whinnies] [Belle whinnies] [ retreating galloping hooves] [birds caw] [cows moo] -[Aimée] Sorry I called you the wrong name, Belle. [Belle snorts] You just look so much like Holly. Same pretty face huh? [Belle snuffles] I used to know everything about this place. -[man] Best thing about horses, they always forgive and forget for a good heart. And carrots. [laughter] -[Aimée] Charlie. I was beginning to think I had the wrong ranch. Well, things might change but this will always be home. You look like you need a campout brew. -I do. -[laughter] Hey, so when did James Hunt become head rancher? -[Charlie] I've been training James to take over since he was a boy. You know that. James stepped up a few years ago and now I play caretaker. [Charlie groans] -[Aimée] Charlie, are you OK? Is it your back? Oh, my back, my knees, my teeth. Don't you worry about it. What happened? I was out the yard when suddenly bang, it happened. What? -I was a cowboy for 40 years. -Oh! [laughter] Why aren't you all living in the main house? It's more comfortable. And that was always Mum's way. James was worried about the cost of heating the place and I'm more than happy at my own place. And James and little Juniper are in the rancher's cottage out back. -Juniper, that his little girl? -Mmm. Little darling. An angel. That still doesn't explain why everything has been packed up. Well, when you didn't come home for the Christmas party the first year, and then the year after that, James packed everything away. Said we needed to focus on keeping the ranch afloat. Are things really as bad as what he says? Sorry, darling. We did our best. Why didn't anyone tell me? And risk you abandoning your career to come here? I don't think so. Your mother would never forgive me. What's the bee in your bonnet? I thought that while I was away things here were gonna stay the same. But if everything was the same, there wouldn't be any surprises. Like an unexpected visit from a dear friend. -[mugs clank] -[knock at the door] I suspect that's for you. -[woman] Aimée -[Aimée squeals] Sienna! Thanks for the letters. I came right over after choir practice. I knew if I rallied the troops those letters would get to you eventually. -Yes. -God bless the post office. [Aimée chuckles] -Are you off, Charlie? -Yeah, I'd better get back to it. I don't know what you two are up to but I suspect I'm gonna need an alibi. [laughter] -Bye. -Bye now. Now, I assume that son of mine is off riding horses and whatnot. Mm-hm. So we can talk about how on earth we are going to save Christmas. Yes. -[Sienna] You are staying for Christmas, aren't you? Oh but just for Christmas. I have to go to Iceland after the holidays for a photo shoot. Of course you do. Such a rolling stone gathering no moss, gaining a certain polish. [both chuckle] So much has changed here, Sienna. I mean, we used to eat dinner at this table every night and now it looks like it's part of a museum. I know. Here. Oh, thank you. The ranch has lost a little of her... -Magic? -Exactly. Yeah. I don't like to see the ranch this way. Me neither. I mean, maybe James is right about cancelling the party. Do you know why the party started in the first place? There was a bad season and my great-grandmother wanted to do something to lift everyone's spirits. Bad season? My darling, it was the Great Depression. And from what my grandmother said, great it was. People left Snowy Oak in droves. There was no work, hardly any food to go around. People were barely surviving. Your great-grandmother decided that Snowy Oak needed to be reminded of the one thing they still did have, each other. I'm not saying losing the ranch wouldn't be hard but some things are bigger than our own challenges. I always thought of this place as an anchor and I like to think of the Christmas party as giving people that same feeling too, you know, something that they can rely on. What would your mother do? She would have sent all the invites already. This is your ranch now, Aimée. You decide what happens next. But if you do decide to go ahead with it, you might need this. Molly gave it to me before she passed. I used it to pull off the Christmas party these past few years. Everything you need to know is in there. I haven't seen this in so long. Thank you for keeping it safe. Of course. [gentle music] How was it seeing James again? You know, I always did wonder if you too might find your way back to each other. You're going to be disappointed. You've already yelled at him, haven't you? Well, then, I'll just have to settle for a welcome visit from Mistletoe Ranch's favourite daughter. [Aimée chuckles] -[Aimée] Hey, Charlie. Do you know where I could pay my respects to Holly? She's in the Pines where the strawberries grow in summer. Thanks. [horses whinny softly] [exhales] [wind howls] -[Aimée] Hey, my girl. Sorry I was gone for so long. Time just flew by. You were such a good girl. So fast. It was funny, when things would get a little stressful at work I used to picture you galloping down a New York street or showing up at a photo shoot, all saddled up. And we'd gallop all the way back to Mistletoe. [branch cracks] You scared me. -Are you lost? -Do I look lost? No. No, you look like you'd be friends with a bear. Not in these woods, not for years. -[Aimée] What are you doing out here so late? What are you doing out here so late? I used to live here. Sometimes I'd come up for a walk. It's peaceful. -[woman] Yeah, it is peaceful, usually. -[Aimée] You live out here? -Yes, I do. Right, then, you'd know Mistletoe Ranch. That's my place. You Molly's girl? Yes, you are. [chuckles] There she is. You knew my mother? -[woman] I did. [laughs] Her Christmas parties were wild. I guess that's your job now. Oh, I could never replace my mother. You don't have to rebuild the fire, you've just gotta keep it lit. [owl hoots] Oh! It's so... Hello? "Molly's famous Christmas cake." [little chuckle] "Where to find the mistletoe." [car engine starts] -[engine idles] -[tail gate bangs shut] [birds chirp] [Juniper hums] Have you ever been inside the big house before? -[Aimée] Hello. -What's the big house? -This is the big house. I used to think there were ghosts inside here but it's just empty. [little chuckle] Will you take my photo? Sure. Here you go. Alright. Are you ready? Big smile. [shutter beeps and clicks] Perfect. Come and have a look. [both chuckle] -You're Aimée. -I am. -I knew you would come. -Oh, did you? Dad and I were talking about Christmas and how much I wanted a Christmas tree, and he said, "If Aimée were here, she'd get a Christmas tree." Well, your dad is absolutely right. [sighs] I didn't mean it to be a wish but I did really wish it. And it is Christmas. And magic happens at Christmas. And here you are. And here I am. You must be Juniper. I like your wings. Thanks. My mum made them. She's a singer. Are you gonna get a Christmas tree for us? Yeah, I think so. How about now? [Aimée laughs] Maybe coffee first. Cover at least part of this. Not all of it but part of it. [footsteps approach] -Oh, good morning. -[Aimée] Good morning. -[Charlie] I hope you don't mind but with you being back and all, I thought you might like a little bit of company. Oh, thank you, Charlie. Trust you had a good sleep in. I slept fine, thanks. Aimée took my photograph. I see you've met Junbug. I have. [Juniper giggles] So, I've been thinking about Mum and what she would have done in our financial predicament. -[Juniper] We're asset rich but we're income poor. [all chuckle] -[James] Young lady... -What? Do you remember that chat that we had about saying things we don't really understand? We have no funny money. -[Charlie chuckles] -[Aimée] Precisely. Look, I know things have been tight but the Christmas party was never about fancy ornaments or expensive gifts. It's more about coming together. And we're not the only ranch in town facing hard times. Christmas is a week away so that gives us enough time for the choir to rehearse, and for us to light up the house, and get a tree. -Yes! -Aimée... -[Aimée] James, look. It's my mum's Christmas book. She laid out everything we need to do. I mean, don't you want things to be like how they were if only for a little bit? What do we have to lose, huh? I think the horses need to be fed. [sound of horses whinnying] -[departing footsteps] -[Aimée sighs] Well, I didn't hear a no. [Juniper giggles] [bright music] [laughter] [bright music continues] [Juniper giggles] [music ends] [horses whinny] Charlie, get down from there. I can do that. -[Charlie] Calm your britches, James. I'm not so old I can't replace a light bulb. That from the bank, I suppose. Well, definitely not a love letter. I know it's tough but that's what ranching is. Tough times followed by the tougher times. And just when you think things can't get any worse... -They improve? -Oh, no, things get terrible. Yeah, it's not as encouraging as it sounds. Well, ranching isn't for just anyone wahoo on a horse. [horse snorts] Did we do the wrong thing, Charlie, borrowing to the hilt to keep the land? Worse thing a rancher can do is slowly sell off land. Break it up bit by bit. You wake up one day and you've got no land to run. You had faith that things were gonna turn around and it takes faith to run a ranch. That and a healthy dose of ignorance. Yeah, well, I've got that in spades. Ahh, Aimée, she's got you in a flap. There's no flies on you. -[Charlie] She always did have that effect on you. You might consider going easy on Aimée. Easy? She's barely been back here and she swans in to make Christmas angels. She has no idea what it takes to run a ranch. Well, that may be but you work close once and that should count for something. It's Christmas, James. She has no family but the people in this house. And she hasn't seen us in years. Wouldn't you think she'd have someplace to go or some fancy party or something rather? Afternoon, Charlie. -[James] Uh-huh. Yeah and-- We just need a little more time. Could you maybe give us until March? Yeah. I know. We've already had an extension. What? Can I call you back? Hi. So, what do you think? -[Juniper laughs] -[Aimée] Juniper! It looks like Christmas! -[James] Did you do this? -Ah, yeah. With Aimée. -With Aimée. -It's all so pretty. I just want to stay up and look at everything. -[Sienna] When your father was young boy, Juniper... -Yeah? -He used to love Christmas. He used to sneak into the church and just stare up at the big Christmas tree and the pillar candles. And do you know who was always there bundled up next to him? - Who? - This one here. [Sienna laughs] They were inseparable and always up to something. I was just an innocent bystander. -[Aimée] That is not true. Oh, goodness, do you remember when you let the cattle out into the valley? [Aimée laughs] OK. That was an accident and if I remember correctly, James had one job, close the gate behind me. I was on a horse. What kind of cowboy can't close the gate on horseback? -[James] I was 12. -[Aimée] All that matters was that the cattle were fine and no-one got hurt. What were you doing in that pasture anyway? [Aimée chuckles] Well, Aimée found out that her favourite cow, Delilah, was about to be sold so she made a plan to kidnap-- -To rescue. -Rescue Delilah. [Juniper giggles] -[Aimée] I thought I could just hide her in my bedroom. -[Sienna] A foolproof plan. Almost. We nearly got trampled in the process. Well, we could run pretty fast back then. I spent three long days rounding up cattle but I'm glad you kids have a sweet, cute, summer memory. Lucky Molly was a decent rancher else we would have lost that herd to the mountains. Dad said Molly had the best Christmas in town. Did he? I did. No offence, Mum. None taken. Molly knew how to throw a party. That's why I'm so glad you came. I'm so glad you wrote. Ma, you're always taking her side. Hey, I'm taking Christmas's side. Ah-ha. -Now Juniper... -Mm-hm? The choir's very excited to perform at the Christmas party so will you lend your beautiful singing voice to the cause? -Yes! -And sing a Christmas solo? Yes. Wonderful. Aimée, this is gonna be a great success. And you know what else is gonna be a great success? The dishes. [all chuckle] You've raised a beautiful daughter. Yeah, she's pretty amazing. What happened between you and Juniper's mum? Ahh, Sage and I get along fine. We just couldn't make it work. She's touring a lot which means I get to spend a lot of time with Junbug. Well, Juniper is a lucky girl. This is a great place to grow up. [Plate scrapes] I thought I might run into you the last time I was here but I think you were out of town. -Horse auction. -Right. [water runs] -I did try to call. -I know. I didn't mean to be away for so long, James. We've been busy. It's fine. -Wait, what are you doing? -Washing up. No, it's my turn to wash. Come here. Are you kidding me? You washed last time. Who remembers? I do. It was just before Mum passed. -Eight years ago? -Yeah. I remember because we had just finished dinner and then Mum went to go get the fruitcake but we had already eaten fruitcake. So you washed, i dried. It's my turn. How do you even remember that? I remember because it was unfair. You ate most of it. -I'm gonna check the tally. -Go for it. I know what it's gonna say. Fine. So, is there, I dunno, some guy wearing turtlenecks and talks about philosophy while eating tapas? Tapas? Yeah, the little dishes you get from Spain. I know what tapas are. No, I'm not dating a philosopher who enjoys small plates of Spanish food. [James grunts] Not much time for love when you're constantly on the move. It's really nice to be home though. Especially at Christmas. Everyone loves Christmas. Not everyone. For some it's just another day. Oh, please, you love Christmas. You used to love playing that piano and driving everyone crazy with Christmas carols. Yeah. I can't believe you let it get so out of tune. [dish clatters] You don't play anymore. -[Charlie] James. -Yeah? Your mother's just leaving. Thank you, Charlie. I'll drive her home. Cheers. When did James become so... Serious? Take it from me, running a ranch is a stressful job. Yeah, I know but he used to sing and laugh all the time. Even when he was working. Who knows what runs through a cowboy's mind. But he certainly doesn't sing anymore. [light music] [birds chirp] [approaching footsteps] [cow moos] [scraping sounds] I see you found your old boots. [Aimée chuckles] -You didn't need to do this. I wanted to help. And apologise. What for? Coming here unannounced. Yelling at you in front of the horses. But mostly for not being here, leaving you to deal with all this on your own. I've wanted to be a rancher since I was a kid. Now I am and I'm this close to buying my own place. You went for your dream, I went for mine. OK. -[James] What's on the docket for today? You gonna build Santa Claus's sleigh in the back garden, fly in some reindeers? -[Aimée] I thought I'd save that for tomorrow. OK. No, I thought I'd help you here with things. -Really? -Mmm. What? I am an assistant for a crazy person, OK? I work 14 hour days. I am not so soft. OK. -OK. -Get to work. Yep. Hey, James, what's all that weird equipment out in the shed for? Soil testing. -[Aimée] Is there something wrong with the soil? Precision agriculture. GPS receivers use soil samples to map out the property, help us figure out where the land's thriving, where it's not. -Kind of brilliant. -Yeah, it's expensive. Didn't really get started, unfortunately. That's a good day's work. Not too exhausted, are you? No more than hiking up to the top of Mont Blanc because the light was just right. I'm gonna show you something. [Aimée chuckles] -Is that what I think it is? -Maybe. [Aimée laughs] What, you don't still play music for the horses, do you? It's been a minute. Are those the old records? You're gonna love this. -May I? -Yeah. They're all still here. This one. [gentle music plays] -You got a little...something. -Thanks. ♪ The clock strikes one... ♪ Something. ♪ In this sleepy town... ♪ Choir practice. I promised your mum I would take Juniper. -[James] OK. Um... I had fun today. ♪ And I wrote this song to sing you off to sleep ♪ ♪ But who could sleep on Christmas... ♪ -[Juniper] We're here! -[Sienna] Ooh, my little Christmas fairy. [laughter] -Hi. -Hi. So, I thought we'd go old school. Ooh. A series of Christmas songs with our lovely Juniper here getting a chance to show off her beautiful voice. I love it. Here you go, honey. Go have fun. The choir's excited. I have missed this place more than I realised. I would have loved to have had you as a daughter-in-law. But I'm just so happy you're back. OK. Let's rehearse. We'll pick it up with bar 33. You good? Over here. Perfect. -You got this. -[Sienna] Two, three. -[Charlie ] "'T'was the night before Christmas "when all through the house "not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse." ["The First Noel" plays on a record] "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care "in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there." Thank you. -[Charlie] "The children were nestled all snug in their beds, "While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads..." The years have softened him. I don't remember either one of us getting a bedtime story. No. More likely to get told off for leaving your hat on your bed. Well, there's more bad luck than leaving a cowboy hat on your bed. Oh, yeah, Sheriff Charlie? Give you a whooping. [Charlie continues to read] We've had some good times here. And you're right about Christmas. I haven't seen Junbug this happy in a long time. Well, I was gonna do it with or without you but I'd rather do it with you. Thank you. -[Charlie, whispering] James! -That's my cue. -[Aimée chuckles] -[James, quietly] Alright, come, Junbug. -Come on. -[Juniper grunts] Good night, sweetheart. Sleep well. [quiet music] -[Charlie] If we move the current loan to a bank with lower interest we will still owe $50,000. And when would we need to pay that? Before the year ends. OK. -[Aimée] You don't happen to have $50,000 in a cuss jar, do you? [Charlie scoffs] If I had of known, I'd have kept up on cussing. Ooh. What about if we sell off some of the lands, you know, the back block? No. We did our best to avoid that. Once you start it's hard to sto, next thing you know... -It's death by a thousand cuts. -Exactly. Truth of the thing is since Molly passed, this place has been a ship without a captain. We've all done our best to make up for it but that's the truth. You inherited this place, Aimée, but you don't have to inherit its burdens. You have a life outside of the ranch but it is your name on the dotted line. I can guide you but only you can decide what to do. -[James] So, what do you want, Aimée? Do you see yourself living here? I mean, this will always be home, of course, and I don't want to see it go but my life is all over the place. Well, ranching is all about taking chances but if that's not what you want, a lot of people have expressed interest so I could make some calls. Um... I need time to think. I'll just be upstairs. [retreating footsteps] Have you told her the other option? She'd never go for it. She might. I don't want to hurt her, Charlie. This place has always been Molly's and Aimée's and I don't wanna change that. Better you than some stranger. [edgy music] [door creaks] [poignant music] [poignant music continues] -[Aimée] Come on, James, keep up. -[James] I'm catching you, Aimée [chuckles] [horse snorts] [exhales] Good girl, Holly. No-one can beat us up the mountain, huh? -[horse neighs] -[James] Whoa. Good boy. You are impossible to catch, you know that. Nothing wrong with coming in second, James. -You need to talk to your horse. -Oh? Yeah. Just try and keep up next time. I'll keep that in mind. [horse neighs] Mistletoe's growing. Oh, yeah. [chuckles] -[scratching sounds] [snap] Why do I feel like I'm always chasing you, Aimée Tremblay? [laughs delightedly] Really? -[James] Yeah. -What do you say? -Yes. Yeah? -Yes. Get over here. -[Aimée] James, it's beautiful. [laughter] [joyous music] [knock at the door] I was wondering when you'd find your way back in here. [Aimée chuckles] It's like walking back in time. I've been to most of these places now. Rome, three times. -[James] Is this Snowy Oak? -[Aimée] Yeah, it is. This renowned photographer, Irene Vore came here in the '90s and did this whole series on Snowy Oak. She even came to Mistletoe Ranch and met my mum. She is the reason I'm a photographer. Irene has this really unique ability to capture a person. She hones in on some small detail like an expression or a tiny gesture that just really captures a secret side of someone. Something they might not even know they're showing. Look at this one here. The lady is looking away so the eye is drawn to her hands. They're cracked and worn. Hands that have known a life, you know? The one she wanted, the one she didn't. It just makes you really consider her and the life she's lived. I wish I could be more invested in my photography but with all this running around, and clients can be... -[James grunts] -..difficult. What? I would have gone with you, you know. You would have hated every second away from this place. I know. But I would have gone. That's why I didn't ask. -What's this? -Your mum's old reels. I moved them up here after I was-- You condemned the place? Something like that. [chuckles] [film clatters on reel] -[James] Come on. Is that Grampa? [laughter] -[Sienna] Ooh. -[James] Hey, Junbug, look at that. -[Juniper] Oh, horsies. -[Aimée] Remember that one? Oh, we still have that one. -[Charlie] Oh, little Aimée and James. Oh. -[Aimée, on film] Mum! -[James] Wow. -[Juniper] Dad! -[James] Mmm? - It's you! -[James] Oh, yeah. That is me. [Aimée sings] ♪ I never knew ♪ ♪ What I was missing ♪ I didn't know you could play the piano. Yeah. ♪ Ooh ♪ -[James] Sounds good. [Aimée vocalises] -[Aimée] Maybe come in with a harmony there? "Warm." -"Warm beside me." -"Me"? "Keeps me..." That song you both wrote, it was beautiful. Mmm, yeah, that it was. -[Aimée plays a chord] -Nice. ♪ Christmas was all but a feeling ♪ Nice. ♪ All of the light shining so bright ♪ ♪ Now it's singing ♪ [harmony] ♪ Ooh ♪ -[James] Swap. Come here. Why? -[Aimee] Alright Mum, let's wrap the treats. -[Aimee] So, we put this up yesterday. Voila! -[James] That is gorgeous. That was our last Christmas with Mum. -[James] That's good. Show me the ring. -[Aimée] I love it. [a few notes played on the piano downstairs] -[woman] Here, let me see. [lid clatters on floor] -[James] Middle C's always been a bit sticky. -[woman] I'll see what I can do. -[James] I haven't played in years but I want to get back into it. -[woman] Yeah, you should. Hey, James? I wanted to test out this camera. Can I borrow you? -[James] Why can't we do this closer to the ranch? -[Aimée] Because the natural light is way better out here. Besides, I promised Juniper I would scour the countryside for some fresh mistletoe. She drew me a map. [Aimée chuckles] -How do you do that? -Do what? You make everything an enchanted experience. It's just playing. You know, Juniper's going to go mistletoe hunting every Christmas for the rest of her life? What makes you say that? I dunno, that's how you do things. You take something, like mistletoe, which is a parasitic plant by the way, and you make it magical. And you made your life magical. Yeah, I don't know about that. I'm starting to feel a little stuck. Yeah, I know the feeling. So, how did you know what to do? I think about what I really want and take the risk. -James. -What? -It's her. Shh. - Her who? The woman from the woods the other evening. You know, the one I was telling you about. -[James] Yeah. I've seen her around. She lives up in the hills. There's something so intriguing about her. She's wild but gentle. She's so enigmatic but kind of mean in like, this cowboy way. [Shutter clicks] -Well, I found the mistletoe. -Mmm? [Aimée gasps in delight] I almost forgot. -[woman] Nice to see some people still appreciate film. Would you like a knife to cut down that mistletoe? -[Aimée] OK, no peeking, alright? [Juniper giggles] Promise. OK. Open your eyes. [Aimée laughs] -You found the mistletoe! -We did. Well, we had some help from this woman in the woods. -Was she a Christmas angel? -Maybe. Yeah, angel with a hatchet. Alright, Junbug, close your eyes. Your dad has one more surprise for you. -[Juniper] OK. -Keep them closed. -I will. -[Aimée] Keep them closed. -[branches rustle] -[Juniper] They are. -[Juniper giggles] OK, Junbug. Surprise. Wow! It's perfect! -Yeah? -[Juniper] It's amazing. -Pretty hard to cut down too. [camera shutter clicks] -[Sienna] Oh, the sound of that camera clicking is driving me right down memory lane. -[Aimée] You are just so wonderful to photograph. -[Sienna] I remember your preference for shooting my right side. Sienna, you are graceful from every angle. Thank you. What else do we have? -[Juniper] Hey, it's a horse. So, Junbug, every year my mum and I would add an ornament to the tree, something to remind us of the year we had. What a lovely tradition. What about this one? Ooh, that one was my first cattle run. And run you did. [laughter] Hey, what's this one? Let's see. -[Aimée] Oh, no, that's-- -[Juniper] Aimée and it's Dad. -Let me see that. -Maybe... -[Juniper] Dad, this is you. -[James] Yeah. That's me. So, what's it for? -[James] Well... -It was when um... I asked Aimée to be my best friend. -[Juniper] OK, so, where should it go? I don't think there's room on the tree for that one, Junbug. Of course there's room. This one can go right... here. -[Juniper] It looks good. -[Juniper giggles] -[Sienna] Perfect. -[Juniper] I want these too. The reindeer galloping off.

[Belle neighs] [James's singing fades] [Charlie chuckles] [approaching footsteps] What are scrawling away over there? Sending out the world's latest party invitations. Mal from the post office said he'd do a last-minute delivery. Hey, Charlie, do you know who this woman is? Oh, I sure do. -That's Ivy. -Ivy. She owns the old cabin up in the mountain. Stern but friendly enough. She likes to keep to herself but your mother was able to coax her down for a hot cider or two back in the day. I think I'm gonna invite her to the party. Well, she doesn't often come into town but it's worth a try. Stranger things have happened. What's with the photo? I thought I'd add one of my photographs for every invite. You know, a little bit of emotional manipulation never hurt anyone. Wiley as a fox you are, my girl. You know what I heard the other morning? What was that? -James singing. -No. [Aimée laughs] You know, in the time that he's been running this ranch, I'd say he's been offered oh, four or five positions running other ranches. Really? Some of them much bigger than Mistletoe. He always declines. Truth be told, little darling, I suspect we would have lost this place years ago if it weren't for James. Of course. I mean, you'd have to be a fool not to see how talented he is. I'm not surprised. That's good. OK, we'll sell the ranch. He'll land on his feet and I'll go to Iceland. Aimée, before your mother passed I promised I would look after this ranch and look after you. You have looked after the ranch and you look after everyone. Part of looking after someone, a part of loving them, is telling them things they don't want to hear. OK. Up on the mountain there grows this kind of weed that makes the herd real unwell. Problem is, they can't get enough of it. Now, no sooner had I cleared it out from one side of the field, the silly cows are into it on the other side. Mm-hm. All of the expensive good hay going to waste. Sometimes we keep doing things that are not good for us. Charlie, am I the cow in this metaphor? Aimée, why you so interested in weeds that are no good for you? When you have a whole barn full of hay? I... have to get these out but thank you, Charlie. Molly, I'm doing my best. [door opens] -[James] I brought some mistletoe to decorate the church. Oh, thank you, hon. -I do love this time of year. -I know. -Hi. -Mwah. -You wanted to see me? -Yeah. There's quite a bit going on, from what I hear. -And what do you hear? -Oh, please, I hear everything. What are you gonna do? Sell. I think she'll sell. Someone's coming over tomorrow to check out the place. But I think it's time that I start looking for a ranch of my own. I'll be fine. I was talking about Aimée. Yeah, I know. Mum, this is the longest Aimée has been being in one place. In a few days she won't even have a home here, she'll have no reason to stay. I wouldn't be so sure about that. She made her mind up a long time ago. She left because I put too much pressure on her. I'm not doing that again. She was a young girl who had just lost her mother. You never know. Leaving might have been the best thing she could have done, for the both of you. What do you mean? Maybe she needed to get away from here, from everything that reminded her of what she'd lost so she could heal and rebuild. Some things we need to do on our own. She still loves you, James.

Merry Christmas. [upbeat music plays in background] -How's Italy? -Oh, it's fine. I'm still at this nightmare of a shoot. But hey, Gustav wanted me to pass on a message. -[Aimée, hesitantly] OK. He needs you to fly to Iceland. Yeah, after Christmas to photograph the Northern Lights. Before. [music blares through phone] He needs you to fly out Christmas Eve. A reindeer herder is moving through and he wants to capture it. No, Micha, I just got here. There's not enough time. I know but at least you can parachute your way out of this weird romantic situation, you know the one you won't tell me about. I have to go because I don't want to talk anymore. But I booked you a ticket and I'll text you, OK? Bye. -Mwah! -No. Micha! [line disconnected] [front door opens and closes] [birds caw] [train horn blares] -[Aimée] We'll send you the contracts to look over tomorrow. -[man] OK. -[Aimée] Nice meeting you. -[James] Nice meeting you too. -[man] Thanks for time. -[James] We'll talk soon. -[Aimée] Wow. That was awful. -[James] No, I thought it went quite well. Yeah, too well. That's why it was awful. No. Hey, I wonder if the new owners will let us take the horses out once in a while. I'm sure they would. Here. I've got something to cheer you up. -[Aimée] What? [Aimée chuckles] Really? Yeah. ["The Devil Knows My Name" plays] [laughs] Oh, we're doing this. -Mm-hm. -Mm-hm. James!

You said you wanted to work from a studio. Focus on your own projects. You can do that from here. Yeah, well, there might not be a here for much longer. Snowy Oak's not going anywhere. -Yeah? -Mmm. But once the ranch is gone, I won't have connection to the town, will I? -[James] Are you sure about that? -[Aimée] Not like this one. Do you know how hard it was to forget about you? Mm-hm. You are literally in the DNA of this place. Every snowfall, autumn leaf, spring day. You were everywhere. What was I supposed to do? If I had stayed I would have ended up resenting you and if I had dragged you along with me, you would have ended up resenting me and... Mm-hm? ..I just couldn't let that happen. And how about now? Ready now? It doesn't work like that. Then how does it work? with you running away again for a couple of years? Aimée, you're just gonna disappear again after Christmas. -Um... -What? Christmas Eve. It was the call I had last night. I have to leave Christmas Eve. James, it's my job. It's the only option I have. Oh, it's not the only option. [Music stops abruptly] It's the safe one. I guess you don't want to take the risk with us. Wait, why you doing this, James? I have a life in New York. I have a job, I have to make money. Why did you come back, Aimée? Why now? 'Cause I thought there was still something between us. -[Juniper] Dad! It's the last rehearsal for the Christmas performance. -[James] Not now, Junbug. Aimée and Dad are talking. Come on! No, it's OK. I'll take you, sweetheart. I'm sorry, James. -Alright, come here. -[Juniper giggles] [receding footsteps] [choir singing] ♪ The holly and the ivy ♪ ♪ When they are both full grown ♪ [door opens] ♪ Of all the trees that are in the wood ♪ ♪ The holly bears the crown ♪ ♪ The rising of the sun and the running of the deer ♪ ♪ The playing of the merry organ ♪ ♪ Sweet singing in the choir ♪ ♪ The rising of the sun and the running of the deer ♪ ♪ The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choir ♪ Ahh. -Sorry we're late. -Better late than never.

[cutlery scrapes] -[Sage] The tour bus broke down just outside of Boston. I cancelled the last few shows, I got on the last train out of town, and here I am. -A Christmas surprise. -[laughter] So, Aimée, are we ready for the Christmas party tomorrow? Juniper is so excited. She's been telling me all about it. Well, the invitations have all come back. The choir is sounding perfect. And Charlie has been cooking up a storm. This cherry pie is delicious. -[Charlie] I've been indulging in Molly's old cookbooks. Who would have thought I'd turn my hand to baking? [laughter] [Sage] Well, an old cowboy needs a new hobby or he'll get up to mischief. -[Charlie] Is this true? -[Sienna] It's looking like being a magical Christmas Eve. -To Molly. - [all] To Molly. -[Juniper] To Molly. -[Aimée] To Molly. -[James] Right, well, we've got a big day tomorrow. I think we should all get some sleep. Sage, can I give you a lift back to your place? -[Sage] That would be perfect, thank you. -[Sienna] Come on, hon. -[Juniper] Do we have to go? -[Sienna] Good night. Thank you. Stay right there. -'Night, Charlie. -Good night now. Aimée I hope you don't mind me staying but your ranch has been a real constant for my little girl. -So, thank you. -Of course. That was always my mother's way and I've been happy to continue it for as long as I could. -Good night. -Good night, Sage. Good night, Charlie. [front door creaks open] Nothing is final until you've signed on the dotted line. [front door closes] I don't know what to do, Holly. With you gone and Mum gone. Then there's this whole thing with the ranch and James. I used to be so happy here. [sobs] [sniffs] [car engine idles] -[Aimée] Don't come in, I'm processing. Hey, I thought you'd like to know I spoke to a potential buyer. We have to make a decision on their offer. Yeah. Yeah, OK. I mean, it's inevitable, isn't it? Yep, seems that way. Hey, James? Yeah. I know I hurt you when I left. You had a lot going on. And I learnt to accept that. And I can't imagine how difficult it would be to lose a mother. I'm sorry that I couldn't do more. [poignant music] [gentle music] -[James] Hey. Looks like you've got enough to keep the whole village warm. Well, that's good because tonight we are keeping the whole village warm. This thing's a big deal around here. Charlie says Aimée has melted your cold, cold heart. -OK. You can... -[Sage giggles] There's the door. It's nice to see the place like this. It has a soul again. [wood blocks clatter] She is good for you. Don't tell me haven't told how you feel. -It's complicated. -[Sage scoffs] "It's complicated." You don't have to tell me that. It's been a long time and she's here now. -[James, softly] I know. We tried our best but we are better as friends. And as your friend, I want what's best for you. Don't let the one get away.

[momentous music] [lively chatter] [Juniper giggles] [music builds to a climax] [Juniper gasps] Aimée, you look... Beautiful. You look beautiful. Thank you. [Aimée chuckles] I suppose I should probably greet everyone. Well, you are the lady of the house. Go get 'em. Good evening, everyone. Hi. I am delighted to welcome you here to Mistletoe Ranch on this fine occasion. My mother, Molly, who many of you knew, she loved Christmas. And now I love it too. Christmas reminds us that magic isn't something that you just stumble upon or something that disappears as we get older. Magic is something you make. I don't know what the future holds for the ranch but what I do know is that there is a special place in my heart for everyone I have loved in this house. And tonight I welcome you all to share in that. So, Merry Christmas, everyone. -[all] Merry Christmas. -[Juniper sings] ♪ Oh holy night ♪ ♪ The stars are brightly shining ♪ ♪ It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth ♪ ♪ Long lay the world in sin and error pining ♪ ♪ Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth ♪ ♪ A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices ♪ ♪ For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn ♪ [harmony] ♪ Fall on your knees ♪ ♪ O hear the angels' voices ♪ ♪ Oh night divine ♪ ♪ O night when Christ was born ♪ ♪ O night ♪ ♪ O holy night ♪ ♪ O night divine ♪ [applause] Whoo! -Did you take this photo? -I did.

I've seen enough. I don't know whether to be offended or not. I'd like to work with you. I have a new contract coming up, a series of portraits of the best and brightest of the New York art scene but they want to shoot on location. Here, in Snowy Oak. Well, clearly you're the best person for the job. What do you think? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Do I know your work? I think it's 116, no, 122 is my favourite. [pages flip] Ivy... Ivy/IV [Aimée laughs delightedly] You're Irene Vore! You're my hero, the reason I became a photographer! What are you doing in Snowy Oak? What are you doing holding Christmas parties? I'm already working as an assistant photographer. I don't want an assistant. I want a partner. And I'll be fully credited for my work? We can say Santa Claus took them, if you want. [Aimée chuckles] I don't mean to be rude and talk figures off the bat but... You have pressing expenses. [chuckles] It's more than enough to pay off this place, if that's what you're wondering. -How did you know? -Oh, it's a small town, Aimée. And this is an old ranch. And it's a very handsome commission. Come to my place tomorrow. -OK. -I'll get something drawn up. And you can look at my studio. You can work from there. Wait. I'm supposed to be hopping on a plane tonight. I'm going to Iceland. -Suit yourself. -But maybe... What do you want, mmm? Do what you want. [receding footsteps] [jaunty music] [background chatter] Ooh, there, Buttercup. Hey, did you see that? Ivy was here. The last time she traipsed up to the ranch was when she took your mother's photo. I think it's a bit of a hobby. Yeah. That's Irene Vore. I think she prefers Ivy. I have to find James. It's nice to see a family in the house again. -[Charlie] You know, I always thought he'd buy this place. I told him to talk to you about it but he said he never wanted to cause you any fuss. He cares for you so much. He said that this would always be your family home. It is a family home but it's just not mine. I'm gonna step out for a moment. Can you say goodnight to James for me? Are you sure? Yeah. It's time to move on. [lively chatter] ["Jingle Bells" plays] Excuse me. -[man] Beautiful night. -[Sienna] It was a huge success. -[James] Hey. Have you seen Aimée? -No, I haven't seen her. -OK. -[Juniper] Dad? -[James] Yeah.. Aimée got you a present. She says you could open it. OK. Mmm. She's giving me the ranch. She knew you wanted to buy it but held off to spare our feelings. -[James] She needs a reason to stay. -[Sienna] Honey, you need to talk to her before she leaves for Iceland. -I need my coat. -I'll get it. -[Sage] Go! Quickly before you lose her to a reindeer herder. She's never gonna accept the money from me. -[Irene] She doesn't need the money. -[James] I'm sorry? Some famous photographer's just offered her a fortune. It's not the money she needs. -[Juniper] Dad! Don't forget to give her your gift. Thank you. Of course. You're amazing. -[all] Go! - Yeah. The stables. -[James] Stables. -Mmm. You're amazing. -[Juniper] Go! -[Aimée] It's funny, you think you think you have all this time and then one day it's just too late. [Belle snuffles] -[James] It's not too late. James, what are you doing here? You should be with your family celebrating Christmas Eve. So, you're leaving? It's the right thing to do. Well, if that's how you feel then... you've got to open your present. Go on, open it. James. I was hoping this would convince you to stay. I know you can afford the ranch. You and your family belong here. -[James] Aimée, you are my family. This place... it ain't home without you in it. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry it took me so long to get back to you. [gentle music] My heart has never belonged to anyone but you. Then why... does it feel like I'm always chasing you... Aimée Tremblay? You're not chasing me now.
