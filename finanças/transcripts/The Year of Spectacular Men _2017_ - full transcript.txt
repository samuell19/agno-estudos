[MUSIC PLAYING] AARON: Izzy was the first girl I met in, I mean, years, who was insecure enough to think that I was right for her. Who could I possibly be right for? I'm a fucking mental patient. ROSS: She was insistent that I, I told her how I felt. Can you believe that? Who does that? LOGAN: I started tallying up all this stuff I loved about her. I mean, shit, dude, she's my fabric softener. MIKEY: I don't know man, she was, was kind of sexy. In, like, a really goofy Special Olympics way. CHARLIE: I think for the first time, I was, I actually met someone who was more depressed and neurotic than me. And that felt really good. I think I love that girl. [MUSIC PLAYING] Look at you, big sister. Now get off that herpes bench, like, quickly. I'll walk you to class before I go to work, OK? Come on, take my hand. Let's go. Ugh, OK. Just, finish college, OK? And then why don't you take a year for yourself? You're a millennial. You could try the whole, like, "having fun in your 20s" thing. They're all doing it. Except for me. Wait, work? I thought you were just here for a fashion thing. Just a fashion thing? Oh, oh my god, Sabrina! Can I get a pic? Yeah. Thank you. It's a three-week-long Vogue shoot that involves a giraffe, an insanely famous actor, and a car bomb. Any of which could kill me. Just be safe. Dude, I am. I'm doing my best to not die in a car accident like Dad, OK? Yeah. Yeah, right. Why are you always so involved in that thing? You're clutching it like it's, like, an infant. Oh. I'm just writing and reading, reading, writing. Sorry it's a habit. You're weird. Iz? (WHINING) Iz. I know that we've had a rough go these past few years, OK? But I go to therapy and shit, you know? You never even cried about Dad. I don't want to get upset. I just want to move on and find the thing. What thing? The thing that makes me feel better. I know you're trying. What is that? It's a salad. There's a whole cucumber in that. But it's also a juice. It's a salad juice. Those are separate things. We live in a modern world, Izzy. Jesus. Do you want to try it? No, I don't want it. No! Ha ha! - Ugh! You're impossible. Ow! TEACHER: I'd like to remind you all that my production of The Mouse and The Minotaur, which I directed and co-wrote, is opening this Saturday right here in the theater. Please support the arts. If you don't, you're getting a D. Have a great weekend. Izzy, may I speak to you, please? Just leave that, I'll-- I'm sorry, that -- Hi. Hi. I need to talk to you a little bit about some class stuff. Right, OK. You've got to do, like, one thing. If you don't pass my class, you don't graduate. You're right. Then here we go, Midsummer Night's Dream. Um. Yeah. - You know what? - Yes. No. Right here. - Is there a world in which-- - No. There is, like, not a world. Take it. Shakespeare? Ross. Please. Ross Wyatt, Izzy Klein. Ross is minoring in theater. And you're majoring in? Molecular biophysics and biochemistry. I thought it would be great if you guys do the scene where Titania has fallen in love with Bottom, the donkey. - Oh. Actually the girl kisses him at the end. If you guys could have it on its feet in the next couple of weeks? Excuse me. Belinda. Oh. Number? Izzy, right? Yeah. This is going to be a real challenge. Looking forward to exploring this opportunity with you. [MUSIC PLAYING] IZZY (VOICEOVER): I've never been good at seeing where I should go next. First steps, middles, and last chapters. I mean, they're literally all a struggle. In matters of the heart, in my path, I'm either frozen or taking aim blindly at my latest guess. I've just never had that moment. You know, where everything falls into the perfect spot. The sun shining just right on your face. And you find the thing. Not a guess, not a lie, not a secret, but a thing that gives you your ending. Look, I don't mean ending in the bad way. I mean, my dad killed himself and he didn't say goodbye. So it's up to me to look at endings like they could actually potentially be happy things. I don't know much, but I do know that I need roots. I need answers. IZZY: Hey, do you want all the extra stuff? Whatever. Do your thing. Just not too cheesy. IZZY (VOICEOVER): Who knows? Maybe this will be the year. Maybe this year I'll get a really good ending. It's too cheesy. Well, maybe there's, like, a less cheesy zone in here. Fingers crossed. Hey, I'm thinking about going to LA. Wait, you're not like, you're not, like, trying to go for the whole summer or something weird, right? I was actually thinking, um, maybe to, like, live. You live in New York. You live here, you live in my apartment with me. Yeah. Um, I kind of have to go back. Pack up your shit. Whoa, wait. What? You said you want to move back. That's the beginning of a conversation about this. I mean, you could come with me. Oh Jesus fucking Christ. OK, or no, then, then we can do long distance and FaceTime. I mean, I can, I can send you those fruit bouquet things with the pineapple on a stick-- Pineapple? What are you? This is not, we're not talking about pineapple. Have you been planning this? You know I just can't plan. I ran out of cash. Get a job. That is what a normal person would do. But you're talking about pineapples. How did I even fucking do this for three years? You and your phases. Brazilian drumming or, this, "I made a salad," once. Your fucking ceramics, which are tragic. That's rude. So what's this phase? This is the, uh, this is, OK, your taking acting classes. So this is the, "I'm going back to Hollywood to become a big star like my sister," phase. Right, Phase-y? I made salad twice. Whatever. Twice, I made salad, Aaron! I knew this was going to happen. I knew you were going to leave. It's just like the band. It's no-- it's the same shit. It's not the same shit. I'm not leaving you on purpose. I still think we can work this out. [MUSIC PLAYING] AARON: You need therapy! You mean couple's therapy? Unbelievable. [MUSIC PLAYING] SABRINA: Izzy, I'm home. Jesus Christ. Rise and grind, Hurricane Isabel. SEBASTIAN (ON PHONE): Honey. SABRINA: Look at this mess. Hey, it's late as balls. SEBASTIAN (ON PHONE): H, h, hey? - Coffee? SEBASTIAN (ON PHONE): Honey, are you still there? All I see is green. - Here. Think I don't know my own sister? (TO PHONE) You owe me 20 bucks. (ON PHONE) Is she really still sleeping? SABRINA: Yeah. (ON PHONE) Dammit. Hi, Iz. How do you feel about getting your third wheel back? Just like old times. Oh, I'm honored. I can't wait. Hey Sebastian, they're ready for you. Yeah, yeah. OK, OK, five minutes. Sorry, I have to go. This AD is bugging the shit out of me. I love you. SEBASTIAN (ON PHONE): Love you, babe. Bye. Oh. Thank god you're still in New York. All right. Thanks for letting me crash at your hotel. Tell me what happened last night. Um. I think it's over. You can never trust a guy who has 20 of the same shirt in the same color. It's not natural. That's not OK. It's not. I want you don't know, Sebastian and I are abso-fruitly stoked you're coming to stay with us in LA. As long as you do your dishes. And remember to flush the toilet when you take a poo. What? I flush. Like California's not in that much of a drought. Once again, to clarify. I definitely flush when I poo, Sabrina. I love you so much. I'm sorry. Oh, good one. This is disgusting, by the way, what you've done here. This is horrible. You should be ashamed of yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] AARON (TO PHONE): I mean, she can't stick with anything. I, I, I'm amazed that we were together for that long, you know? Yeah, no, I hope she fucking moves on, or whatever. But, look my career is blowing up. I don't have time for this shit. Yeah, yeah. No. No, I can't make the gig. I've got, like, a stomach thing. No, it's fucked me up. Hey, how was the Vogue shoot? Oh my god. Please tell me you got me what I wanted and not some tree, bark, pilaf, dirt shit. Holler! Thank you. Oh, how was the, the giraffe? He was being really difficult today, actually. Are you going to leave all that on, or? I wanted to eat my greens in character. Hm. I walked by Aaron's on my way here. How many times do you call me and you're, like, "He's a lunatic." He is a lunatic. I'm doing a scene with a really hot new guy from class. When I said, there are other fishies in the sea, I meant, like, look through the sea. Not immediately at the first person that shows up. All I said was that he's good looking. That's it. - Don't do it, Izzy. - All I-- - Don't. - That's-- - Do. - Sab-- - It. Just, like, don't do it at all. Hey, scene partner. Come on in. OK. Wow, the view is incredible. Thank you. Oh, you mean that? [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] Um, so, you know, I thought that we could start by, by just, like, reading it through a few times. Or we can just jump right in and start rehearsing. Great. Yeah. Where are we? Um, god, I want to say it's, like act four-- Wow, that's um, bold, bold move. Acting without relaxation is chaos. And this is an exceptionally chill strain of indica. It'll help us go deeper. [ALARM CHIMING] (WHISPERING) Shit. - Mm hm. - Oh. - Mm hm. - Hi. How are you? Good morning. Good morning. You know, lots of girls tell me I'm an exceptional cuddler. [NERVOUS LAUGH] For sure. Um, OK. Let's, uh-- Izzy, what's the rush? Stay for a cappuccino and a biscoto. Heh, I have class. So-- Hey. Uh, woo. Really, really great work last night. I'm serious. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, bye. Bye. So? Whoa! Car bomb photo shoot. Oh. - Aaron-related offense? - No. But I got rubbed up on by a Ken doll boner and then offered an Italian coffee drink. Are you OK? You're asking me that right now? It's avant-garde, but, I like it. Ma! With the exclamation point. What is she's saying? Can I see? Sabrina, stop! - Dude! - Sabrina! - Oh, that's just lush. - What? That mom's dating a woman? - No. It's that she's dating Britney's stand-in from the Mickey Mouse Club. No, no! What? Aaron's going to throw away my ceramics. Where are you-- where are you going? How can you be so casual about this? IZZY: What, about Mom? This is, like, so weird to me. You're really weird about everybody Mom dates. Not ev-- everyone. Honestly, if Dad was alive, he probably would've thought it was hot. I said it. I've got to go. SABRINA: Izzy, no, don't go [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Those. Oh, OK, cool. Hey, um. We're not together anymore, right? It's just that you never actually said, like, "We're breaking up," or, "This is over." So I just want to make sure that you're not still my boyfriend. You know, you know what's always, uh, pissed me off? It's that. No one should love that show as much as you do. And I just realized that I feel the same way about you as I do this poster, which is that I'm sick of looking at it. I am not your boyfriend. - Yeah. Despite what you might think-- that was rude, by the way-- I'm not hurt you want to get rid of my poster. But those, I left here for a reason. Why would I keep anything here that reminds me of you? Because I thought that eventually you could look at them and think about us in a good way. I just want you to get rid of this stuff. I don't want to stare at it anymore. Well, you could have just sent them to me. Oh wow. Wow-- Wow, what? What? You, you have some nerve. To leave me and then waltz back in here and insinuate that this is about sex. No, I-- I don't need you, Izzy. I don't. I've been with plenty of girls in the last couple of weeks. It's not a big deal. And you know what? It's even better. Because they don't stay over. What does that mean? Like, you never slept when I was here? I lived here. You don't actually ever leave the house, so you must have been really tired, you psycho! You you're the fucking psycho. OK? Why am I the psycho? Because who has a top sheet phobia? - I have a top sheet phobia! - Who? Besides you, name one person who has a fucking top sheet phobia! I do! I feel like they're strangling me. That's insane. That's not insane! It is insane. Insane? That's insane! You're the Rain Man of t-shirts! There's like nine hundred million t-shirts right there! You don't know shit. You're insane! [MUSIC PLAYING] Aaron. No, no, no. We shouldn't. - Yeah, we should. No, no. Stop it. Stop. We really shouldn't, we're not together. You just said you're not my boyfriend. We shouldn't do-- - Shut up. - What? - Shut up. Don't you want to see it one more time? What? You want to see it one more time? Who says that? I do. Yes! Dammit! I hate you! I hate you so much. That's it, right? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ross? Hey. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. OK. Do you mind? Oops. ROSS: Now if we're going to talk about postmodern BK Grass roots, which I do believe we are, you have to look no further than [INAUDIBLE] mustache's trajectory. Izzy. Hi. Hello. Izzy, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Izzy. We're working a scene from a Midsummer Night's Dream together. - Yeah, um, well, we're trying. So-- I know a place where the wild thyme blows. Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows. Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, with sweet musk-roses and eglantine. MARIA: Beautiful, Ross. It's going to be a revelation when we're through with it. To summer. May it be the greatest of our young lives. Slainte. MARIA: Cheers. I'm sorry, did I, like, bump you with this? - No, no. - No? Nope. It's a lot of vase. I try not to travel with it. I got in a bit of a situation. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bump you. ROSS: Izzy, let's focus. Let's get you a drink. OK. Great. We are the champions. [INAUDIBLE] Ross, what's up? Whoa! King Ross. King of Darts. Resident darts champion. Couldn't risk being dethroned. Hey, Prescott! Good luck with the merger, asshole! All right. It looks like you're [INAUDIBLE].. Yeah! Aw! Ah, shit. It's fine, it's fine. OK. But the train's that way. I know. Waaaa! Waaaa! OK. Yeah? Isn't there a, a kiss that we have to work on? Um. I mean, you know, just because our lines are a little fakey doesn't mean the kiss should be. OK. Yeah. Uh, do you want to take it from the top of the scene or, no, more towards the middle, right? OK. OK. I say something about dried peas. And then, "But I pray you, let not your people stir me. There's an exposition of sleep come upon me." Fairies be gone in all the ways away. So doth the woodbine and the barky fingers of the something. [MUSIC PLAYING] Wanna, like, do that one more time for safety, or? That was good. I'm OK with that one. Um, I mean you, left the bar with me. You brought me back here and-- w, we just kissed now. And it was like-- Great acting. These rehearsals are really coming along. Let's have a sleepover. We can watch something else. Iz? [GAGGING, VOMITING] Oh my god. - Wait, wait. Who is Ross? He's the, the theater guy. Huh. But you didn't sleep with him? - N, n, n, no. - Yes or no? You sleep with him? Or you didn't sleep with him? No, I slept with Aaron. So, it's Aaron. Yeast infection. You got a yeasty from having sex for like six mins? - Such a bad one, too. - Sorry, sir. That is God striking you down. - I don't know. [INAUDIBLE] is also a contender. You know, it's a really good thing that you are not actually crushing on this Ross character. Because if I Irish goodbyed just to blow chunks outside of his apartment door, I'd be hiding under a rock right now. (SIGHING) Yeah, yep. Izzy, don't tell me. You are actually? Izzy, come on! What? He leads you on in a totally heartless way and is shallower than a kiddie pool. You're post-breakup, you're pre-real world. Save a little face while you still have some. That's, uh, harsh, Sabrina. I'll tell you what's even harsher. One, you're not staying here for my college graduation. Because you are mean spirited. - No. It's because I don't want to see Mom and her adorable child bride. That's not even, like, a thing. Two, I don't think you remember that I have a boyfriend at home whose show just went on hiatus. And if I leave him alone for too long, he starts heating up his take-out by leaning it against a radiator. No. Yeah. Oh, oh and this stuff, this stuff right here, is literally made of crackers and going to itch my vagina off my body. - Give me your hands. - Uh-uh. Not again. - We've talked about this. I really don't want to do this. There is nothing on the box, Sabrina. If you can imagine, people come to this specific spot. There are stranger vagina hands all over these products. Stop! There's no vagina on my box. Vagina in your thumb, vagina in your fingernail. We received a glowing review from you, professor. It says here, miscast as donkey. No. No chemistry with scene partner. I'm assuming the scene went badly, then. It was. I blacked out. That's what happened. I blacked out. Do you think the teacher's going to pass you? I mean, I walked in on him making out with one of his students-- aptly named Belinda Hooker-- in the utility closet last week. So, yeah, I mean, I think he will pass me. If you're going to go to LA and do this, you have to start taking the work seriously. Like, you're not always going to have Belinda Hooker to fall back on. I don't know what I want to do. I don't why I'm going home. I don't know anything, so. Well, maybe you need to take a moment to think about that type of shit. Did you learn that in your sensitivity training course, Sabrina, or? My car's here. I suggest that you shove a T-pon up there quick, all right? Have a good graduation. Bye. Say hi to Mom. Have a safe flight. Say bye. - Bye. - Thank you. Oh my god. Look at this piece of shit. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi! Oh, Isabel Klein! Oh, my moon and my stars. You're a college graduate. Dog, so true though. Check it out! Look at this. Ah, a bachelor of arts. Yeah. Wow. This cost, wow. Yeah. You know, honey, I could feel your father's spirit with us during the whole ceremony. And I could tell that he is so proud, so proud. Of course he would have rather you graduated from Yale. But this is OK. Thanks, Mom. Uh, where's Amythyst? Oh, she had to run uptown to the International Yoga Center to get some bodhi yaya wind chimes in F sharp. They're very, very special. But she's going to join us for vegan. What? No, Mom. Vegan? Please. Just, no. - Honey, honey, honey, honey. Sabrina told me you had waffles for dinner the other night. Why are you-- you and Sabrina are having conversations about my diet? It's a concern of the family's. You know, maybe you should just let the vegan go. Please, don't do this to me. That's-- Hey, honey! You got the chimes? - Yeah! Hey! So nice to finally meet you. Oh my god, yeah. Let's go in. Your graduation was so beautiful. Thank you so much. I love this place. I know, it's my favorite. You know what? They have the most amazing beet zucchini quinoa salad. Do you want to split that? Yeah, let's do it. - What is quinoa? - It's ah-- WAITER: Are you ladies ready to order? Hi, can I have, like, a coffee with six sugars? WAITER: OK. We'll have a pot of Matcha Warrior, no stems. WAITER: All right. - Thank you very much. WAITER: You're welcome. Be right back. I hear that you broke up with Aaron. I'm really sorry to hear about that. I wish you would have told me sooner. I did. I left you, like, 74 voicemails. No? Deb, you do kind of go off the grid when you're on retreats. I know. Mom, how can that be more important than the quarter-life crisis I'm in the middle of? Huh? Seriously, I mean you're her girlfriend for, what, a year, right? Can you do me a solid here and alert her to shit, like her child is clearly suffering? We're not girlfriends, honey. We're soul walkers. DEB: We're not defined by societal conventions. We're not "in" anything. We're "on" a journey. We are. I love it. I don't think I'll understand anything you just said until I'm, like, past enlightenment. Oh, so I hear you're moving back to LA to live with your sister. - Yep. Just going right for the jugular. Look, Mom, moving back home after college is a totally legitimate rite of passage. Like wearing a choker made from old tights. I totally did that. Or owning a Furby backpack. Did you have the all black one or the spotted one with the pink feet? I had the all black one. Too nostalgic! Dude, I know, they were radical. Honey, I know you just graduated. And life might seem a bit, you know, overwhelming. And you've always been a little bit confused about your purpose. The ceramics were a low point. But no one's path is a straight line. It's more like a squiggle. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, uh, JFK. [MUSIC PLAYING] SABRINA: No, n, no, no! I'm not giving you anything today. Hi, Izzy! Go away guys. SKETCH: Come on, Sabrina, we're your buds. We know you have somebody in there. Who is it? - Yeah, yeah. Is it Zac or Sebastian? It's Sunday. We agreed we wouldn't do this on Sundays. Right, right. Guys, she's right. MARG: Sorry. SKETCH: Just saying, just saying. It's a sister. SVEN: Drinks caddying. MARG: Are you the sister? Are you someone? SKETCH: Hello! Hello! SVEN: Hey, guys, we made an agreement. Pack it up. Did you, did you not help with her with her bags? I got it. Hi! How are you doing? How are you? I'm so sorry I didn't pick you up at the airport. That's OK. I'm glad you're here, though. You're just glad I'm here, because you know I'll buy you (WHISPERING) alcohol. Oh my god, I'm no rogue. OK? I am genuinely happy that you are here, but if you got me a six pack of IPA at the end of the day, even better. I see you. - You see me, dog. - Hi Izzy! Hi. Hi. Whoa, this bitch has gone full Martha Stew. She's churning her own butter now. Really? Yeah. Um, hey, when can I move into the downstairs, by the way? Oh no, I forgot to tell you. Um, we've been on location so much that we started renting it out, sorry. Just so you know, we're keeping you up here for your own safety. Those rapscallion PFFs are relentless. Tell me you mean "paparazzi friends forever." Guys, come on and sit down, the food's hot. And for the record, that is not my fault, that situation. OK, TMZ came up with this story that I was cheating on Sebastian with Zac Efron when we were shooting Crazy Youth. And because the movie is about to come out, they want me to vaguely perpetuate it. But I guess it could be worse. He's a really nice guy. What else am I supposed to do? Sorry. They're more like super fans. See what I have to put up with? Butter? Um, yeah. The depression has set in hard, I see. One-- (MUMBLING INTO PILLOW) I'm confused about my purpose. --two, three. Iz? (GRUMBLING) Get up, do something, five, more useful with your time. My path is a squiggle. (EXASPERATED) Oh my god. (MOANING) This isn't a suicide suggestion. Just open up a fucking box. [MUSIC PLAYING] She ruined everything. She ruined everything. I can't sleep with a fucking top sheet anymore. You know sometimes, I don't know, we'd sit there and watch TV and, like, you know, eat popcorn. And just, like, be a couple. And in those moments, I loved her. Or I think I did. She was almost animal. And every time she would come around, I just, I just wanted to, like, hump around and say, "What are you doing right now? Who Are you?" Too much. What was her name? Izzy. She was, uh, she was always eating those M&amp;M's. Season six, episode three. - No. - Yes. At the end of episode three on season six of the X Files, Mulder finally tells Scully that he loves her. But she doesn't hear him. Well, maybe she does hear him. But, you know, she doesn't absorb it or take it seriously, or something. It just, it's, it's got me thinking how many times does that happen in a person's life? That you don't see what's directly in front of you, that you don't hear people. I don't know. I guess I'm just wondering how you ever meet the right person. Maybe it's just luck. That's a shitty answer. Maybe you have to be ready. They can't just walk right into your life and command you to pay attention? Maybe they already have. Maybe they already did like 1,000 times. But like Scully-- see I was listening-- you weren't ready to see them yet. Oh, this is actually really-- Izzy, do you want to come with me to this? You're not serious. Izzy, you have to leave the house at some point. If you spend one more second moping over those pussy ass bitches, Ross and Aaron, I'm going to hit you over the head with a cast iron skillet. I'm going to Fox Mulder's poetry party book launch? This is incredible timing. This is such good news. So many important questions! Namely, I've been wanting to ask him about that kid, Gibson Praise, who just disappears at the end of season five with no explanation. And it's, like, what happens to him? So is that a yes? IZZY: Yes! That was a yes. Hm. She's looking for David Duchovny. Oh, thanks. Oh, so my agent, Joey, he's going to be here today. And I know we talked about this in New York, but he said that he'd send you on a few auditions. Just go talk to her. It will be fine. See how you do. Oh, OK. So when he gets here-- Yeah? - Chat him up. - Right. Right? Um, yeah. Chat him-- whoa, totally chatting that up. Only two? Izzy, don't get grease on my dress! - Oh my god, ow! - Ow! BOTH: Oh, are you OK? - I'm sorry. Whoa, that was hard. Sorry, that was kind of creepy. I didn't recognize you when we hit each other. You're the drum-- I'm the, no-- Oh my god, you're-- You're Aaron Ezra's girlfriend. You're Aaron's drummer. BOTH: No, no, no, no, no, we-- We don't date anymore. I'm solo. We broke up. - This is my band now. - Oh, OK. You want-- I'll go-- you want to go first? - You go first. - OK, I'm Izzy Klein. I'm sorry. Logan Holt. Nice to meet you. Nice to officially meet you. It looks like you folded on that one. Folded? It's slang, "folded." I can make it up to you later on, if you're down for, like, In-N-out? - I love In-N-Out. One, two, three, burger? One, two, three, burger! I'm going to see you in a minute. OK. All right. Was I supposed to pound? But I clapped. I mean she used to date my friend, Aaron. She used to date my friend, Aaron. I mean, we played in a band together. Of course, now I've got my own band, Gravy, you know. She was beautiful. I mean, I never look-- I looked at her, you know, she was my friend's, friend's girl, so. So you guys are the producers of all nine seasons of the X Files? So my sister is going to freak out. She's obsessed. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I'm leaving with the drummer. - (SARCASTICALLY) Oh, atta girl. - Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to meet Fox Mulder? No, no, I do want to meet Fox Mulder. But, ah, you know he's at the point right now of being unfashionably late. Listen, Izzy, don't get into a car with a stranger. That's rule number one of life. No, no, I know him. He wants to buy me a cheeseburger. - Oh, then it's fine. - CTFO. Does that mean "chill the fuck out?" Yeah, which makes me wonder is she on mushrooms? Oh, TBH, honey. Oh my god, we're doing way too much acronyming. I'm on mushrooms. So, um, what's the deal with you and Aaron, lately? I don't know. We left things on a very janky note. You're beautiful. No, uh-uh. Yeah, you are. You don't believe me? I mean, I don't know you, really. I know you. How? Aaron's rehearsals. How could, how could you have noticed me? I just, like, sat in the corner and did dumb school stuff. I noticed you, but you didn't notice me noticing. Wow. Yeah, that confirms it. Fine. Game! There's a game? No, we should go. Oh. That was my way of inviting you. We should have sex. We should definitely have sex. Let's have sex, yeah. Yeah, let's have sex. Do you have, a, um. Uh-huh, um. A condom. Of course. Let me see. Here we go. Which color should we-- I don't care. Any color. I'm going to go with blue. I'm gonna go with blue. Let's, just. Here, you put it on. You want to put it on? OK. Yeah, right there. - OK. Do you have any, like, lube? It's just, like, so rubbery down there. Do you have any lube? - You need lube? Is it too big? No, no, no. It's great. (GASPS) OK. Yeah, yeah, there you go. Yeah. OK. Do you think-- can I, can I get on top? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just-- OK. OK, so how about we get on the floor? On the floor. LOGAN: Dance, dance, dance. IZZY: Whoa! Uh, that's, yeah. Whoa, that's, oh my god, there's so much sweat. OK. Oh now I'm sweating because it's so good. OK, yeah. Oh my god. OK. Can I get on top? Yeah, yeah, yeah, get on top. Did you need me to take it-- I got it. Yeah. Wait. OK. Is it too big? No, no, no. I mean, it's big. Yeah. How big is it? It's super big. It's super big? - Yeah, yeah, really big. - Oh my god. What? What the-- what's on me? What is it? I should-- we should come. No, no, no, you go. (MOANING). Gravy! Woo! Hoo. Oof. That was hot. That's the best sex I ever had. Kiss me. Kiss me. Are you guys up? I need some advice. My day, honestly, cannot continue until it's talked through. It's 6:30 AM, Izzy. Rather be dead than alive between the hours of 5 and 10, but, you know, it's just how the cookie crumbled. So-- - How many cups? Four, and if my math's correct, that'd make it 24 sugars. I had sex with the drummer. His name's Logan. We know. What do you mean you know? I smell like sex, don't I? No, it's the same dress from last night. Oh. OK. So, I have some technical issues that I need to discuss. Can I go? You can go. We were using lube and, uh, it exploded. And then we got on the floor. And then I got on top. And then he kept asking me to tell him how big his peen is. And that was awkward. Oh, that's everything to a guy. You just gotta lie. Yeah, I agree. IZZY: Yeah? OK. And also, he's sweats a lot. Like it was dripping off his nose onto my forehead. Right there. SABRINA: I think you have to go. - No, be quiet. - I need you to-- Izzy. So, this guy, are you going to see him again or no? OK. Well, that's the thing. I mean, I decided I should try out this "having fun in your 20s" thing. And, you know, I really want to give it a go. And he's awesome. Well, if you can deal with the sweating, I say, you know, give it another shot. You never have mind-blowing sex on your first time, anyway. Well, not according to him. He said it was the best sex he'd ever had. Poor bastard. SABRINA: Wait, OK. I'm mad at you. - What did I do? You completely dropped the ball last night. Joey was doing you a huge favor. And you literally left before he even got there. Do I, like, call him, or-- Mm, I'm thinking more like a carrier pigeon, like a message in a bottle, a telegraph. Yeah, Izzy. You should call him. Not at 6:30 in the morning! Right. BITCHY CASTING DIRECTOR: Izzy Klein? No the producers thought she was lovely. She just wasn't black enough. OK. Uh, Izzy Klein. Hi, how are you? You' OK with nudity? Uh? Sideboob, half nip, you're fine. Yeah. Yeah. Did you prepare all four scenes? Yeah. We're just going to do the first one. The one where she's being killed by the king zombeaver? That's what I said. Oh, yeah. BITCHY CASTING DIRECTOR: And-- No, no, no, n, n, no! Don't come any closer! You stop right there, beaver. Back it up, back! I have a knife. I got a knife, beaver! (YELLING) My leg! Oh god! (SCREAMS) LOGAN: I mean, she was beautiful, awkward. I mean, we both were artists, kind of like, you know, it's like I'm a musician, she acts. I don't know, we just, we kind of had a connection, you know? She loved my sweat. August, gross. When did that happen? M&amp;M's? You must really like me. You know it. And I just got a tour. What? Whoa! Oh my god! Are you so excited? Definitely, really excited. Yeah, that's, um, how long is it? Three and a half months. I leave August, August 30th. Wow, that's, um. SKETCH: Good morning, dear. She's not back yet. She's still on a press tour. Oh, shit. I could have got Charlize and that baby today. SVEN: That little Jackson's very present in front of the camera. MARG: Yeah. - Thanks for letting us know. I wasn't telling you that to be nice. I just want you all to get off the fucking lawn. Bad day, eh? Yeah! Yes! Do you want to talk about it? Yeah. I don't know you people. I'm Sven. Marg. Sketch. What's wrong, honey? I don't know. I just, I feel like I've been making all the wrong choices. I've been circling all the shit answers. And I also just really like this guy, and he's leaving for three months. And I'm feeling so hangry. MARG: Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know, we've got an extra coffee bean, here, hon. Would that make you feel better? That's not extra, that's mine. Well, it's fine. Give her the-- It's hazelnut. No, it's a pure chocolate blended. You, you, it's yours. Really? That's my favorite. Wow. I don't know. I just, I'm just thinking, like, maybe when I get back I'll take you on a trip to Cabo, [INAUDIBLE].. Van Nuys is right within my budget. Logan? Logan? What? When are you going to play some music? Oh, in a minute. In a minute. Got it. All right. Hey, um, really quick. I know that we haven't talked about being, like, exclusive or anything. I just want you to know that, like, if you sleep with someone, if you spend the night with someone while you're on the road, totally cool. - I'm not going to. - No, no, no. I want you to know that I'm no, like, stage five clinger. I wouldn't freak out or anything. You want me to be-- GIRL PARTY GOER: Logan, come on-- --faithful? or do you want me-- GIRL PARTY GOER: --everyone's waiting! - Huh, wait, what? - Go, go, go. It's fine. All right. MALE PARTY GOER: Come one everybody, let's hear it for Logan. [MUSIC PLAYING] I mean, I know she's still in love with you. Even if you're not still in love with her. I mean, she's my best friend. Honey, I love that you're so obviously, method. You know, the greasy hair, the bags under your eyes, the next day clothes. - Oh, th, thank you. - You're welcome. The thing is, the scene needs more punch. Punch? You're supposed to be dry humping him. Do me a favor, next time you do the scene, pretend Chad is the chair. I need to see more physicality on the tape. You ready? And go. OK. Like this. - Right. - This good? - Uh-huh, go. - OK. Um, Chad, I don't think this is a good idea. You're still dating Sarah and I-- Yeah, more, more. I don't believe you. Give me a scream. (SCREAMS) She's still my best friend! You know, I think we got it. I think we got it. - Yeah? Yeah. Thanks so much for coming in. OK. All right, I'll see you. Say hi to your sister for me. Oh, hey, Joey. How's things in agent land? JOEY: (ON PHONE) Not great. Actually, we need to talk. Oh, really? JOEY: Yeah, I just can't send you out anymore. OK, uh, did I do something wrong? JOEY: No, no, casting directors [INAUDIBLE] is fine. You didn't ever hear anything about Zombeavers? I mean, that one seemed to go-- JOEY: No, not really. OK. JOEY: No more auditions. No? Right. Um, uh, there's nothing I can? JOEY: No. But happy Friday, though, huh? Chin up. - Thanks. SKETCH: Oh, it's Izzy. SVEN: Hey, hey! - Hey, Izzy. - Hey, Iz. What's the excitement today, weirdos? Well I guess you haven't heard. No, heard what? Come on. Come on, Sabrina just booked a huge bestseller Warner Brothers is adapting. SVEN: She's already a big deal. But this will be her transition into adulthood as a film star. The industry is going to take her very seriously in a big way. You know, we don't want to speak too soon. But the three of us think she's going to get nominated, huh? (ON COMPUTER) --and another thing-- SEBASTIAN: Boot your hand out of here. What about, what about, like a succulent garden? SABRINA: No, I know that that's like the responsible, drought resistant thing to do. But I want tulips. I want those big, fat, fatties. Like these guys? Like those ones? A juicy fatty. The domestic grind commences. Hi! I'd hug you, but I'm very busy with this situation. All of this. How was the tour? SABRINA: It was horrible. It was just like one giant mall after another filled with screaming miniature people. And all they wanted to do was touch Zac's abs and tell me I'm a cunt. Do tweens use the word "cunt?" Actually, he kind of made it-- Zac-- made it tolerable and even fun sometimes because he's, like, such a sweet guy, you know? You just got a new one, right, Sab? Ow, ow. I'm literally dying. - Got it. - Oh, yeah. That's a big. Juicy. IZZY: Well, congrats. I'll give you guys some privacy. Oh, um, I'm not going to go on auditions anymore. Why? I'm just not cut out for it. Never try, you never know. Ten points in the back end? He's done like two and a half movies? Iz! IZZY: Shhhhhh. Izzy, are you going to come? IZZY: No, I'm re-watching season five, episode 15. Are you sure? IZZY: Yes, I'm sure. It's the one where Mulder's Father is involved in the conspiracy. That's my sister. I'm worried about her. [MUSIC PLAYING] IZZY: Aw, Scully! How could you reach under there? [MUSIC PLAYING] Sabrina! I really need you to reset the internet. Izzy! IZZY: Like now! Scully, Mulder, don't you guys realize you're soul mates by this point? I mean 100% pure, sweet, not from concentrate soul mates. Just ridiculous-- - Hey! It's December, fuckhead! And I am absolutely dreading this holiday season. And because you're forcing me to go visit Mom and that creature, not even excited to hang up my goose with real goose feathers ornament! IZZY: You have better ones. That boyfriend of yours is about to come back into town. IZZY: He's not my boyfriend. - So what? You said, "We don't have to be exclusive." IZZY: I'm scared. Pussy! You can't blame this all on him. You've also been too "scared," apparently, to get a job. Or a personality. Or a packet of floss for the last three months! IZZY: Well, you promised Mom you'd go to Tahoe. I'll make you a deal. I will go to Tahoe semi-willingly if you get the actual fuck out of this room and do something with yourself! But if I hear Sculder talking to Skinny talking to Mulder talking to Skelly talking to Skinny one more time, deal's off! IZZY (VOICEOVER): Somewhere in the middle of all this, I think I realized how much I hate being alone and how much I really hate goodbyes, so it didn't matter how sweet Logan's was. It still left me on Depression Island, due north of Internet Stalkage and slightly west of Acid Reflux with "the thing" floating somewhere out there in the water. I gotta find it. I gotta fix this. I've gotta get my ending. [MUSIC PLAYING] Izzy. Aaron, is that a, um? Navy blue shirt. Totally. Wow. Um. I'm sorry. What are you doing in LA? Oh, I'm just, you know, here for the band's show. Yeah? Yeah, I'm going to go to the Fender custom shop and check out this, um, butterscotch tele relic. You know, baseball bat neck, jumbo frets, black pickguard, preferably. Preferably a black pickguard. That's like hieroglyphics to me, but very hip and cool of you. Yeah. How do you know Logan? Um, we've been, uh, going out. Yeah, since the beginning of summer, actually. - You and Logan. - Yeah, me and Logan. Funny. Not really. - Um, how is your acting going? - It's good. It's going so great. Izzy, Izzy, hey! Hi! How are you? I'm good, yeah, wow. Crazy. Hey buddy. Blue shirt? I know. The only constant is change, man. Dope party, though, right? It is what it is. Thank you for having me. Of course, of course. You know, you know what? Can I talk to you for a second? Yes, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's um-- [MUSIC PLAYING] How creeptastic is it that Aaron's here? How did he even know you were having a party? Uh, I invited him. Um, that's a little weird. Yeah, I wasn't, like, thinking about, you know, I was-- Um, are you OK? I saw my ex. Um. Did something happen? Did you? You guys slept together. Fuck. How do I say this? Um, we're, back together. Together, together? Yeah. I mean, what? You said I can do whatever I want on the road. Despite whatever Jedi mind garbage I told you before you left, I actually waited for you for three months. Because I like you. A lot. This just sucks. What are you, Izzy! [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Jesus. Leaving already? Yeah, super tired. I just think it's really fucked up. And you know what you did. And you're a piece of shit for it. What did I do? You want to tell me what I did, huh? You were a slut and a whore. And don't even try to lie to me about the fact that you just walked away from a conversation with me to go suck Logan's dick. And also, when you talk about your acting, it's nauseating. And you're a brat. And you're pretentious. And nobody gives a fuck. Oh, wait. I'm remembering something right now. Oh my god! It's a crazy thing. You're not my boyfriend! You don't get to say shit like that to me anymore! You left me in New York. You kissed him in front of me. What is this, the Cabbage Patch Kids? Yes, I kissed him in front of you. No I didn't suck his dick for like one and a half minutes. I'm pretty sure you know that's not how that works. Also, as far as New York is concerned, I don't know, Aaron. I don't know. Karma must be a real bitch because Logan just dumped me for his ex. And Sabrina's agent stopped sending me on auditions months ago because I was making him look bad. So I'd definitely say that I'm not pretentious. And you're right, no one gives a fuck! You gotta stop feeling bad for yourself. What? No! I get to feel sorry for myself. That's something I can do, because I have an ex-boyfriend who thinks it's acceptable to call me a whore. What's wrong with you? We were always a disaster. And we should not get back together. This is an attempt to try and get me back? I thought maybe that we could have sex, but. But no, it's not-- we should not talk anymore. We don't ever talk, but OK. Well I don't want to see you again. I don't want to see you, either. And I'm sorry about that just now. That's not really a good enough apology. - Well, I'm sorry! - You know what? I'm not the crazy one! You're the fucking crazy one, Aaron. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sabrina, this is part of the deal you made with your sister. You can handle it. Hold these, please. Did you ever consider that you might actually like your mother's partner? No. OK. Please buckle your seat belt, OK? Buckle your seat belt, OK? Buckle your seat belt. Stop it. Please stop it. Buckle your seat belt. Bu-- goddammit, just-- ow! Oh, oh! Oh! I'm sorry! Did I get you? Ow, ow. No, inside. Inside. Inside. No, no more. No keep your hands in. Merry Christmas. No, no, no, no! Let's stay! I don't want to go! I don't want to go! No, no, no! AMYTHYST: You know, we got this tofurky at the farmers market in town. SEBASTIAN: Cool. So, you were born "Amythyst" or? No, actually, my given name is Amy. Oh. That's why I spell it A-M-Y-T-H-Y-S-T instead of A-M-E-T-H-Y-S-T. So, your last name is "Stone." Yeah. And you thought that that would be a good idea, to make-- Cabernet, honey? I got an amethyst bolo tie from a healer in Santa Fe. That's too wild. SEBASTIAN: Yeah, that's it. That's all. Honey, I've got some quinoa. It's good. Mom, I actually still don't know what that is. It's gluten free and really high in protein. DEB: It is. Is it something that you bake or fry? I mean, you fry it? If you fry it, then maybe. I wanted to ask how did you guys meet? I don't think I've, she never told me the story, so I-- AMYTHYST: Well, after college um, I bounced around for a few years and started doing yoga on my own. - She does yoga. - Oh cool. Loves it. And from there, I got into Deb's podcasts. And then I found out she was living here, just, like, a block away. Too cosmic. I did a retreat about a year later, and yeah. That's great. I love that story. That's great. Isn't it great? - Yeah that's really nice. I want to make a toast, to Amythyst and all our loved ones near and far. Cheers. SEBASTIAN: Cheers, to love, right? AMYTHYST: To love. Super wishing you we're here right now, Dad. Oh, Sabrina, I read your script. It's quite wonderful. But I was wondering, it's set in Las Vegas, why are you shooting it in San Francisco? I love how you're switching the subject, Mom. That's great. I have to pee. Real. SEBASTIAN: Sabrina-- Uh, do you know what we've been watching? "Bad to the Bone." AMYTHYST: Yeah, it's so good. It's bad. That's very sweet. And, and, there's um, there's not. There's no bones. It's been, um. Can you excuse me for one second? Do you eat each little individual quinoa or do you do, like a whole big bite of all the quinoa together? Sabrina. Not in the mood. Good night, baby. Bye, thanks, sweetie. IZZY: Ew, Mom. You, too? Mom, I'm kidding. Well your sister isn't. Dude, why is she being such a honey badger? I don't know. Maybe because she treasured her father and he loved her the most. And, you know it's kind of like when you're the teacher's favorite in third grade. And then in fourth grade, shit gets real. Like you, just lost an ally? I don't know. I'm not going to tell Sabrina. About Dad? Are you? No. So, we're hitting the slopes tomorrow. Are you coming? Totes hilare, Debra. Vee-vee funny. XO, XO, your super athletic child. Bring it in. I'm so tired. Will you do the dishes, please? You finish. I can't take it. OK, I got it, here. Thanks. Hey, Mom? Hm? You seem happy. That makes me really happy. SEBASTIAN: Woo! It's snowing! You know, Amythyst, this is steeper than I remember. Yo, peeps? Mom? I didn't actually think that we were going skiing. Honey, you went skiing all the time when you were a kid. It's like riding a bike, right you guys? - Totally. - Yeah. - Not really. - All right! Try to keep up suckers! AMYTHYST: See you down there! Will you stay with me? Absolutely. Let Sebastian be responsible for "Amy-thyst's" deadly pine tree collision. You kids go on ahead. You guys good to ski? One hundred percent! No I don't ski-- I do not ski. - Let's do it! Bye, guys. All right, you ready? Go! - Not ready at all, actually. - That's not. All right. - (SCREAMS) Oh my god. Grab my, grab my pole? (GROANS) No. That's not the way. You know? I feel like that's, that's not the way up. Maybe this is-- - Oh, oh! OK! OK, look at my skis. You want to do a French fry. And you want to go, pizza! French fry, Izzy? - Yeah. - Izzy. Izzy. French fry. Fr- pizza. So what happened there is, is that you didn't do pizza. You just kept French frying. You don't know how to do this, do you? I'm a world champion skier, Sabrina. Obviously, I know. (YELLING) I just told everyone, like, 97 times, I don't know how! Where's the best place to learn how to ski? On the top of a double-black diamond! We can do this. - I can't get down this hill. Ma'am, are you OK? Huh? We're fine sir, thank you. Oh no, nope, no. Not OK. I've been a participant in the Downhill for Down Syndrome Celebrity Charity event the last few years. We'll be fine. Are you sure you're OK? I'm required to take anyone down that's in pain. Yeah. Huge pain. All over pain. All. - Are you guys sisters? - Yeah. We were sisters. Good luck to both of you. - I'm Mikey. - Mikey McCarthy. No, Mikey McGowan. How'd you get so close? You know, it's a funny thing. I actually barter psychic information for 100% guaranteed mountain removal. Yeah! Woo! Woo hoo hoo! Classy. Woo hoo! Ha ha ha! Smooth moves! I bet you get a lot of girls on their backs every day. I'll work on that one some more. (TO RADIO) Yeah, can I get a gurney down here? Whoa, gurney? Geez, no. I'm fine. MAN ON RADIO: What's that, Mikey? Seriously, I'm good. - It's protocol. - N, n, no! Search, I've got a deep seeded fear of gurneys. A phobia, really, that and sheets. Sheets? Yeah, yeah. Sheets. (TO RADIO) I'll call you back. MAN ON RADIO: All right. Maybe a beer at some point would persuade you to take me out of this thing? I feel like the Michelin Man dressed as the world's largest banana split. Thank you. Bridgetender Tavern. When? Tonight. OK, where? It's off the old service road. OK. - What's your name? - You have to guess. Now you're just being irrational. This is completely irrational behavior. Why are you being so nice to her? I'm not being-- she hasn't done anything wrong. SABRINA: What the fuck are you talking about? She literally ruined everything that my mother ever had with my father. SEBASTIAN: Your father's accident happened four years ago. And your mother wants to be happy. And Amythyst makes her happy. SABRINA: OK, no, I get it. You think she's cute. You think I didn't see that you liked your Instagram picture last night? I, I liked her Instagram picture because it was a picture of her-- At 10:36 PM-- --and your mother. Quite a late time to be looking at Amythyst's Instagram. They're in a relationship. If anyone is guilty of outside interest in this relationship, it's you with your never ending tacky fucking publicity stunts that you're doing-- Um, hi. Hi, Izzy. Can you, just, not now, please. So the guy that took me down the mountain, I, I promised him that I'd buy him a beer at Ye Old Shenanigans, something or other. Anyway, you guys want to come? - No. - No. OK. Let me try that again. Um, I actually need you to go with me on the off chance that this is one of those, like, Nightline, Craigslist-y type situations. So what do you need, like 45-- It's a winter boot. It's a winter boot, honey, it takes a lot. Forty-nine, 49. All right, why don't we give him a fucking hour to get his shoes on. - Hooks. It's got a lot of hooks. I'm just asking, are you guys OK? Yes, we're OK. Four years, we're always OK. Hey, where'd Mom and that precious gem run off to? I don't know, some exclusive holiday party, apparently. Yeah, I new that was going to-- I skipped a loop, OK? Let's go. In, in, thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, there's people here. Potentially might live tonight. Oh, this is it. This is the party. That's your mom. - Oh! Woo! No, no, no. This is unacceptable. Mom? Mom! What are you doing? Woo! ALL: Shot! Shot! Shot! - No shots! No, no, no, no shots. No. No shots. - She doesn't want it. I don't like it. And I don't want it. - Hey, you guys. It's nice to see you. I didn't know you were going to be here. I didn't know you were going to be here, either. I'm so sorry you got here so late. I have to go, I have a 7:30 class. The hot toddies are two for one in five minutes. Oh, I'll be fine. MIKEY: Hey, guys. Oh my god, you guys, this is Mikey. SEBASTIAN: Mikey, the rescue man. She told us she could ski, but apparently-- No, I literally never said that. DEB: Yes you did. You said you could ski. Mikey, thanks for getting her down the hill. - Thank you. - OK. I'm going to come with you, Mom. Honey, honey. Look, I know you're mad and I know that I'm mad. You're mad, yeah. I don't fight, OK. Look at me, I don't want to fight. I should have been more sensitive about your dad-- You really should of. Hey, come here, come here, come here. For your troubles. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Whoa. It's cool that you save lives, man. Yeah. I've played people, please. She plays save lives? Come again? You know. You fucking know. I can live with that. SEBASTIAN: Whoa, fuck. I'm sorry that my sister is giving you such a hard time. I think that you're super duper nice. I know. I'm, like, really trying to meditate through this. But it does make me, like, super duper sad. For sure, bring it in, OK. That's, loving. That's a lot of emotion. Don't-- have a Tums. Tums is, Tums helps with everything. Uh, Amythyst, catch you on the flip side. Peace out, Girl Scout. They're going somewhere, I think they're going to have sex. I hope so. I think, I think they're going to have sex. - Is that good? - They could. They could do it. It's a free country. Is that the bolo tie you told me about? Mm hm. That's so crazy. Bethany. No, no. No. Tammy. Tammy! Yeah, a little rough, Tammy's a little rough. I'm from Los Angeles, not, like, Tacoma, Washington. Just tell me your name. I can't tell you. Is it Britney? Like Britney Spears? Yes! You know I'm a Britney fan. Oh, oh god! Oh! How about, Dana? Dana? Like Dana Scully? How'd you know I'm an X Files fan? I barter psychic information, too. [BOTH LAUGHING] OK. This time, I'm going to go. I'm going to go this time. Don't, come on, don't leave. You're being very dramatic for having met me yesterday. I'm Izzy. [MUSIC PLAYING] MIKEY: Have a good one! Hey, Seb. Hey. What's up? Nothing, just-- Did you sleep at Amythyst's last night? Uh, yeah. Yeah I just passed out on the couch. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Hey, you guys are up early today. Uh-uh. I chit chatted all night with Search and Rescue guy. Seb crashed at Amythyst's. - Oh, well that was nice of her. - Yeah. Yeah. Hi, hon. Dude. You look so wrecked. On a scale from one to hung over, how hung over are you? Really. We slept together last night. IZZY: Oh, snap. Are you kidding me, right now? We did. You slept with my daughter's boyfriend? We were both so drunk. And I haven't been straight since I met you, Deb. But I've been wondering-- I'm sorry, you fucked him? Are you fucking me right now? Taking back the super duper nice comment, right now. - You could be my mother-in-law. - She's right. You could be her mother-in-law! Jesus Christ! Deb, I don't remember exactly what happened. Did you put your penis in her vagina? Mom! Mom! No! What did you expect, Sabrina? Look at this shit. Look at it! How am I supposed to? You fucked Zac, right? You must have fucked him. Or you fucked someone else. Or you just got lonely on the road, because ever since you got back, you've been pushing me away little by little. And you don't push away someone that you love. Unless you want out. Unless you fucked up first. IZZY: Uh, to be fair, Sabrina. You know, I think that maybe you drove him-- - Izzy-- - [CROSSTALK] Wait, so let me get this straight. So you did this to get back at me for something that I, never did. Is that correct? This is as much my fault as it is his. Dude, fucking right it is. Dude, really? You're a real home-wrecker, you know that "Amy-thyst?" (SNIFFS) That's right, I said it. Because your real dumb name is Amy. You turned my mother into a dyke. And then you decided, "Oh, you know what? I want to go have some non-dyke-y fun" with my boyfriend for the holidays." - No, Sabrina. I actually do think that I am gay. This whole thing has been very clarifying for me. And, no offense, Sebastian, but now that I'm not blackout drunk, I'm endlessly un-attracted to you. IZZY: Mazel, mazel. The best way to get clarity, hands down. SEBASTIAN: There you go, Izzy Klein, being funny. I mean, no one's even going to stay with you long enough to cheat on you. Um, OK. You know what, dick? I have not got the time to listen to you assholes hurling insults at each other. It is 7:45 and my entire group is already in virabhadrasana one right now without me! You guys just all have to get your shit together! You, you have to leave. Bye. I never cheated on you. I never hid anything from you. I gave my whole life to you. [SOBBING] Ladies, this is how we deal with heartbreak. And I am telling you that it eases the pain. Take one. Thank you. Thanks. What now? I'll go to my yoga class. And you'll go to San Francisco, and make your movie. And you will go to LA and get some kind of job. No, Mom. I'm going to go to San Francisco. What? You are? Yeah, I mean, you drink a lot of juice. So somebody has to-- be buying juice full time. Bitches need bitches. We don't got much of an option now. All we got is bitches. Fuck 'em. - Fuck 'em. - Fuck 'em. [LAUGHTER] Come on. So, welcome to Las Vegas! No? Uh. [MUSIC PLAYING] That drek texted me. Texted! I'm going to be honest, here, Sab. I don't want you to be honest here, Iz. Honestly, you gave up on him pretty quickly. I can see why he might want to start small. He gave up on me. Then I gave up on him. I'm tired, Iz, of watching him and watching you. It's tiring. But I, I don't, I mean, you, you love him. That's-- I don't want to talk about this. Whatever happened to meatloaf? Hamburger? Yeah, and dry-aged rib-eye. Oh, you mean Mikey. Yeah, ski patrol guy. I don't know, that's just a "having fun in your 20s" thing, I guess. Like, a casual fun chill time. Oh, OK, huh. Feast your eyes, Casual Klein. I bet these are Production's way of apologizing. For putting us in Full House Street. Where Sven, Sketch, and Marg are sure to appear there at any given moment. FANS: Hello. I didn't even think about that. Huh. So, I feel like those are from-- TELEVISION: This week on Bad to the Bone, Nathan finally found Old Blue. - Uh-uh. No, change it, dude, change it. I got it, I got it, I got it. TELEVISION: And he's hurt, hurt bad. Bad to the Bone. - I got it! I'm changing it. OK. I'm sorry. No! CHARLIE: If I'm nice, I'm too nice. If I'm mean, I'm too mean. Don't walk under ladders on set. It's the same as in real life. Don't be stupid. What've you got going over there? Trail mix. Why didn't you just get a bag of M&amp;M's? I like a challenge. Then what do you do about all the raisins, the peanuts, all the other stuff that's in there? I mean, you can have it if you want. No, no, no. I just like M&amp;M's. I'm, um, I'm Sabrina's sister, by the way. Oh, why are you here? Assistant. Must be a bunch of hoohas running this operation. Because, apparently, I'm getting paid a legit amount of money to just sit here and eat free stuff. That's, uh, that's funny. So I didn't catch your name. I'm Izzy. Izzy. Charlie. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Reed. I'm the director of, of this hooha operation. You're the director? Yeah. And you're in my chair. That's my name. M&amp;M's? Yeah, no. It was a great first week. Thank you guys for all the hard work. Hey, have you guys seen Sabrina? No? Nobody? SABRINA: Just a second. Dude, oh, dude, let me in. I have to pee so bad. Sabrina. Sabrina! God, oh, oh, oh my god. I forgot to tell you that I got caught sitting in your director's chair. Are you OK? You feel bad about a guy. Welcome to my world. What is wrong with you? Can you not make this about you for once? Can you try to be my big sister for one second of your life, please? This whole thing, I feel terrible about Mom. She's going to die alone now because I'm a nightmare. And this fuckboy can't keep it in his drop-crotch pants. You know what I mean? It's just not fair. Because she wanted to happy. - We should do a song, Sabrina. - Song and dance. Song and dance. Mom, you watching? Uh-huh. Six, seven, eight. (SINGING) Give my regards to Broadway. Remember me to Herald Square. Tell all the gang on Forty-Second Street that I will soon be there. Whisper of how I'm yearning to mingle with the old time throng. Five, six! Give my regards to Broadway and tell them I'll be there e'er long. How was that, Mom? Oh my gosh. Who do you love more? Oh, me? Oh, you're the cutest, Mom. IZZY: Mom, did you see my boobs? DEB: No, I didn't see your boob. [YELLING] If I'm feeling something, I should-- Hi. You came to visit me? No, I, I'm staying, I'm staying right down the street, you know? Yeah, do you want to? Yeah, I kind of want to-- OK. Hi. Hi. I was, I was looking at that. I like when the buds aren't open, but they just look like they're just working so hard. You know? - They want to live. They want to live. My dad didn't want to live. Your dad? Dad killed himself. But we weren't that close, so it's-- Well it's your dad. Your dad's your dad. She doesn't know. So please don't. No, no. I wouldn't. Yeah, me and my mom just decided not to tell Sabrina, because she was 15. And she thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. You know, we didn't want to ruin it for her. Selfish of you. Selfish? It's her dad, too. Have you ever, have you ever told anybody that? No. Sorry. - No, thank you. - No, that's-- So, what is, what is that? [MUSIC PLAYING] - It's-- Bye. I don't want these flowers, so I'm just going to put them right there. Thank you. Can you take this? Hey. Hi. We need to rehearse in my trailer in 10, if that's cool. We'll go over 63. - No. - These are from Sebastian. - Yes. No. Charlie, yes. No. Sorry. Um, hi, Izzy. Hey. It's good to see both of you, but, yeah. Izzy. I'm here for you right now. I am here for you, right now. I am assisting. That's my job. Hi, I'm Izzy, I assist. I big sister. Yep! Thirsty? I knew it. That's what I thought. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. - Hi. - You look nice. So do you. OK, bye. - OK, bye. I want to know. You have to just give me point by point why it's a great show. OK, part of it is their chemistry because, you know, they're so different. They're, like, polar opposites. Scully is a skeptic. [MUSIC PLAYING] Vegas ISN'T for losers, Howard. Vegas isn't FOR losers, Howard. Vegas isn't for losers, Howard. Darling. Darling, Howard. Darling, Vegas isn't for losers. - It made your day. - It did. You want to get a drink? No. Want to watch a pit mix in [INAUDIBLE].. No. You want to-- Um. This. They're from Sebastian. - Um. They're irises. No, I don't, I don't want them. Oh, OK. Sorry. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sorry. My stupid carpet is slippery. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Izzy, Izzy, we should stop. What? Wh, wh, wha, why? Stop. I, uh. Fucking came, I came. I just came. Oh. Um. That's OK. I'm just going to-- roll. That's fine. Do you want, do you want to, like, wait a couple of minutes and we can try again. Oh, fuck. Fuck. I honestly. I don't care at all. No, no honestly. Thank you. I like you, OK. I'm so embarrassed. Don't be. I don't care. I don't fucking care. OK? All right? I have to take a shower. I can just feel it everywhere. You can shower. I just got to clean it up. But then we'll hang. I, like, filled up-- I mean, it's a lot, so that's good. It's, like, a compliment. But it's just-- That is a compliment. - A ton of-- - Don't-- --semen. I don't know why I'm fucking weird, though. I'm weird about this stuff. Don't get annoyed at yourself for your real thoughts. Your thoughts are your thoughts, end memo. - Hey! - Hey! I, uh, I got you something. Yeah, OK. Yeah! Just the M&amp;M's. - That's hilarious. - What's up? How are you? - I'm good. We're good. Yeah, I'm good. Just, like, going through. Just, I'm actually in the middle of the meeting with these guys right now. So, we're just trying to figure it out. Right, OK. - I'll talk to you later. - Yeah. All right. Um. I was wondering if you could talk. Do you want to come outside? Or, I'm here now, so. - Hey. - Hi. Come down. I'm just in my socks. Um. - Hi. - Hey. This is different now, which is dumb. That shouldn't be. No, I'm just. I've been so exhausted. I'm just trying to get through these last few days, you know. You were right about the jizz thing. It was a compliment. - It wasn't about that. I like being alone. - No one likes being alone. - I do. And I'm, I'm going to go to sleep, but. That's what I need to do right now. No, Charlie, Charlie! I felt like you saw me. And I saw you. You saw who I was, that we can be ourselves. And then that was really great. Tell me I didn't make this all up. No, you know what? It's OK. I don't need that. I don't need it. [MUSIC PLAYING] What about the phone? It's all the things I can't say. Fuck. What do I say? What do I say? See. You want answers to questions. You want-- then I'll tell you. The answer is like I haven't ever been fucking laid before, not really. Or that I can't fall-- I can't fall like you. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how you just go all the way in. It scares me. And I'm bad at it. And I don't. And I want to-- I want to give you an answer, like, I love you. I do see you. I see you right now. I saw you. I love you. [MUSIC PLAYING] I see those made the cut. Yeah. You want to know what card says? "Sabrina, I want to give my whole life to you. Love, Sebastian." Like, ew. Kind of great. It is super sweet. Can I, um, read you something? Yeah. I mean, yeah. There's nothing accidental about anything for us. Me to men, it's no accident. Mom to moving on, it's no accident. Your disquiet, your distrust to Sebastian, to us all. I'm sure now that, um, secrets are lies we tell ourselves. I'm just not sure how long you could feel it. That there was no car accident. Nothing is an accident. Not the length of my lie. Or the sureness of Dad's choice. Not the curve of the planet or the days in a year. And I'm selfish. And I had to tell you. I had to read it because I'm not a good big sister. Come on, sister. Full house street never lost its creep and I am RDY to space jam. Let's go. - Come here. - OK. So, Iz. If you thought that vagina hands were bad, this is AIDS feet and dog wormies and SARS. Come on, come on, Sabrina. You want me to sit on the ground? Yes, on the ground. I'll use this. Only because I love you. No more wormies. This is gross. I feel like the stuff will feel better if we yell it. What stuff? I miss you, Dad! Oh. OK. So that's what we're doing? - Yeah. Yeah. I miss you, Sebastian! I'm sorry, Sabrina! About what? Dad killed himself? Yeah. He didn't say goodbye. I hate it when people don't say goodbye. I hate it! You've been big sistering this whole time. Can I small sister real quick? OK. Well. I read your notebook. I read all your stories. It's your year of spectacular men. I never thought about it that way. What do you mean? I mean, don't stories have endings, I mean, you'd think I'd have an ending. Because that's what I wanted. I wanted endings. I wanted answers to questions. But, look, here we are. Look at those flowers, there's a million answers. That's Aaron and Mikey and Logan and Mom. And Dad. And Dad. And Charlie and Ross. "Amy-thyst." And Sebastian. And they're all attached to the roots. To mine and yours. They're the answers. And I don't want endings. More. Aren't we privileged that we get to have more? You're fucking good, Isabel Klein! I mean, you're my big sister. And you're right, things do feel better when you yell them. [MUSIC PLAYING] IZZY (VOICEOVER): I kept thinking that this year would tell me a story. But it turns out, I wrote one instead. One with some totals and struggles and selfishness and squiggles and sistering. Do your thing. IZZY (VOICEOVER): One where certain people really should get their ending. Everything falling into the perfect spot. The sun shining just right on their faces. A moment of togetherness where you have the extraordinary privilege of saying hello and not goodbye. I've never been good at seeing where I should go next. And that's funny to me now. Because, I mean, the real secret is that nobody knows. And everyone's just guessing. And there is no thing. Except for the one tiny thing I do know. The one small thing I know for sure, which is that in every story every single person gets an ending. It's just that now is my beginning. [MUSIC PLAYING] The sex was great. There's always that, I mean, that's such, like, a guy thing to say. I don't know how she's doing now, but, I wish her the best. Wish it could have worked. This girl couldn't ski to save her life. I saw her fucking snowballing down the mountain. I had to take her down on a gurney. I don't know why I'm so weird. I don't know why I had to be weird with her. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Take my hand 'cause there are no answers and there are no ends. 3-6-5 dance with me, dance with me. We are alive. We are alive. We are alive. We are alive. We are alive. 3-6-5 it's so good to see you. You look very nice. Are you listening? I want to tell you I've been where I've been. Take my hand 'cause there are no answers and there are no ends. 3-6-5 dance with me, dance with me. We are alive. We are alive. We are alive.
