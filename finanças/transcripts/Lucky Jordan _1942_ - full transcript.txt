All set, Lucky. Okay. Go to that place on Madison. I open up the joint tomorrow at two. Come on. I want to go over to Park Avenue and open that place. We're wearing a hat today. You know, until I hired you as a double, I didn't know how good looking I was. I hope he shows pretty soon. Nothing I hate like rushing to a train. He won't be the first one out. He sends Eddie out first, just in case. You told me. Yeah, but from fifty feet you can't tell them apart. You got to watch it. I'm watching. From Kansas City I got a couple of .. Good afternoon Mr Moran. - Hi. Don't you ever get lonesome out here? Wouldn't you rather be .. inside? I'm in there often enough. From now on you'll be be in there even more frequent. A lot of things are going to be changed around here. What do you mean, Mr Moran? You'll find out. I think I'll step in there and try that chair for size. What's the matter with you? Nothing. I'm a little on edge. I've been to the dentist all afternoon. Better have a drink. - Yeah. Can't use you, Big-Ears. Mr Jordan. Just give me a try. I'll do anything. I've got all the guys I need who'll do anything. Blow. You too. Hey, Slip. How'd you like him for a double? I don't know. He's a little short. He's uglier than me, but with a haircut and a little practice, I think he'll do. What's the matter? You mad at Eddie? Mad at him? I'm giving him a swell funeral. You don't mean something happened to him? Yeah .. he didn't know what hit him, but it did. You know who did it? Someone who knew enough to figure he'd come out first. Just on a hunch, this afternoon I came out first. Good thing I did. For me, I mean. What's your name? - Angelo Palacio. You're hired. - What am I supposed to do Mr Jordan? Just dress like me and tag along wherever I go. Is that what the other man did? You know .. Eddie? Johnnie, get him to my tailor. Get him a wardrobe. Look here Mr Jordan. I didn't ask to come here. He just brought me. I got a job .. setting up pins in a bowling alley. It's a nice alley. You're lucky to get out of it. Sooner or later you'll get hit by a bowling ball. You know boss. I'd never forgive myself .. If something had happened to you while I was sitting safe in the dentist chair. Mr Higgins is here. Hello Lucky. Hello Slip. Did you fix it? I feel it's important you should know .. - Then you didn't? See, you can't go through the usual channels in a thing like this. What kind of a lawyer are you anyway? Lucky, you can't go offering bribes to a draft board. They put me in the army. I tried everything. I even tried to get you in 4F. What's that? It is .. 'socially undesirable'. What do you mean 'socially undesirable'? Dames like me. That's not exactly the connotation. It means .. I'll be frank, Lucky. Everybody knows you control all the rackets in town. That's not considered 'socially desirable'. Nobody's pinned anything on me yet. I know. That's why I couldn't get you in 4F. I pay you not to take 'No' as an answer. - Lucky, it was out of my hands. This isn't like fixing an ordinary beef. There's a war on .. Don't I know it. They closed Santa Anita. Look, Lucky. I'm your attorney. I do whatever you want me to do. My private opinion is. That everybody owes it to his country to serve. I don't owe anything to anybody. Everything I got I got the hard way. Many guys tried to stop me getting it. Now, there's no use getting belligerent about it. Because unless a man has bona-fide exemptions, he goes when he's called. Yeah? - Yeah. You don't have a wife and children tucked away somewhere, do you? Don't be stupid. Women are okay in their place, but not to marry. Now, parents in some cases are grounds for exemption. What about yours? - I haven't got any. I mean I never knew who they were. First thing I remember I was in an orphanage labelled .. 'unadoptable'. I think you're in for it, Lucky. Take another think. If I must have dependants you get me some. What? - You hard of hearing? But .. you just said you don't know your parents. Sure. There must be some old fag who's willing to call me 'sonny' for the right amount. That's fantastic. I'm not paying you to tell me I'm fantastic. Get going. I'll have a mother by morning or I'll put you back chasing ambulances. I never chased an ambulance in my life. Okay, if you'd like it better, we'll have one chasing you. Alright Lucky, I .. Go with him, Slip. In case he starts waving that flag some more. Good morning, Lucky. I'd like you to meet your 'mother'. Hello Mister. Or should I call you 'son'? You just keep your lip buttoned up. Is this the best you could do? - I can't really hire Whistler's mother. This is the old dame who's always mooching quarters on Times Square. She's drunk all the time. - I am not. I can't afford it all the time. Don't you know better than to be drinking at your age? I'd rather be drinking at your age. But .. time marches on. I know she isn't perfect, Lucky. But she has to do. Keep your mouth shut and don't breathe on anybody in there. I give you fifty bucks when you come out. Fifty bucks? For that I'd do a swan-dive off the Statue Of Liberty. Lucky. The head of the board will be sympathetic if you don't antagonize him. I play golf with him. I told him you're applying for re-classification .. On the basis of new evidence. Never mind the college talk. Just keep me out of the army. Mr Jordan, the only physical deficiency I see listed here is 'Rose Fever'. Yeah, I'm allergic to roses. I break out all over, and start coughing and sneezing. Of course .. not many battles are fought in rose gardens. Mr Hunnicutt, when Mr Jordan filled in that questionnaire .. He listed his parents as 'unknown' as he honestly didn't know their whereabouts. But since then he has located his mother. I see. Rather strange, isn't it? Finding your mother just when you need an exemption? She just showed up. Are you dependent on this man? - Am I? How much does your son contribute each month to your support, Mrs Jordan? I give her a thousand bucks a month. - A thou ..? That's very generous. - I believe in treating her right. I see no problem here. None whatever. Anyone who can afford that for his mother is obviously well fixed .. To serve his country without sacrifice. Appeal denied. George, I doubt you explored every angle of this case. Mr Jordan's resources .. Ernie, if we explored every angle, we'd have to turn it over to the FBI. Mr Jordan, you'll be inducted on the date originally set .. good day. I'm not through yet, Lucky. I have other contacts. If the worst came to the worst. I'll get you transferred to an easy post here so you can carry on running things. You'd better. - I will. I will. I'll just retain every payment of yours until you do. Goodbye, Mrs Jordan. Goodbye. Did I do alright, Mr Jordan? Sure you did. You made me glad I'm an orphan. Thanks. Thanks a lot Mr Jordan. Thanks. My corns are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Shouldn't we get Jordan up? - I'm not going to touch him. What are you afraid of? He hasn't got his mob here. Then you do it. - Yeah. Hey Jordan .. wake up. Listen Bob .. I want you get one thing straight. As long as I'm bunking here, I don't want to be disturbed. I'm not hanging out any sign either. I was just doing you a favor, Jordan. We're due out on the morning line. When it goes to twenty-to-one, let me know. Jordan. Jordan. Come on, get out of here. Blow. You might as well learn that this is the army. At five-thirty the bugle blows. At six-fifteen you're on the meat-line. For the next half-hour you've got nothing to do but eat. Then we start the day's work. That goes on every day. Week in and week out. Just like a clock. You'll go like a clock too or I'll wind you up and break your mainspring. Captain .. how much do you make here? 78 dollars a month. How'd you like to make 780? Say, do you think you can bribe the United States Army? That, I'm trying to find out. Jordan. Up out of that bed. Okay. Don't strain your tonsils. Where did you get the fancy bloomers? I like to look my best in case people drop in on me at night. Get out of the panty-waist and into your denims. We're going on fatigue duty. I mean fatigue for you. Hello, Helen. Anything doing? No. Pretty dull today. That soldier's been here all morning. He didn't even go out at noon. I asked him if he wanted anything. But he just looked at me. Then went on staring at that magazine. Some boys who are away from home for the first time are pretty shy. I don't know, but somehow I think he's been away from home before. Put any root-beer on ice? - There's plenty of everything. Bye, Jill. - Bye. Hello soldier .. I understand you didn't have any lunch. What did you do, get your face lifted? - What? What happened to the other dame? Gone for the day. I relieved her. It's a relief to me too. What about a midnight supper in my tent tonight? You're pretty fresh. You're pretty .. period. Hey cute-eyes. How about a bottle of beer to go with this empty bowl? I really don't think you ought to drink this. With all the popcorn inside you, you'll swell up like a balloon. That'd be great. Then I could sail away from this camp and nobody would know the difference. What's a matter with you? Are you homesick? Yeah. Pretty lonesome. I miss having my own things. Don't tell anybody, but I always slept with a teddy-bear. If you were busy, you might not be so lonesome. Haven't they given you anything to do? Sure, the colonel has me on special detail. He wants me to think of some way to entertain the soldiers. Hey, wait a minute, I got it. We build a staircase of peppermint candy. Then while the band plays 'Beat Me Daddio To The Bar'. You come down in a pair of high heels and chevrons. Then for a gag at the end we .. Drop the chevrons off. I'm glad you thought of that. Now there's no reason for you to hang around here anymore. Yes there is. The Navy wants me to think up something for the sailors. Excuse me, dearie. Maybe you could give me a steer. I'm looking for my boy. Did you ask for him at HQ? They told me to at the gate, but all these buildings look the same. Go back to the next corner and turn left. I had a feeling I overshot it. Hot ain't it. - Yes it is. You haven't got a drink around here? Have you, dearie? I've got some nice cold root-beer inside. Never mind. I'll run along. No trouble at all. I'll get it for you in a minute. Hello, son. What are you doing here? I came down to see you, son. What for? I got sort-of lonesome. You did, huh .. Nice having you come down. That sounds more like my boy. I guess I sort-of took you by surprise. Yeah. Ain't you going to kiss me? Yes, sure. You're stiff. I ain't neither. I had a couple after breakfast but ain't had any since. Okay, okay. Break it up. Won't you sit down, Ma? - Thanks. I'm alright on asphalt, but those gravel paths really kill me. Well? I hope you ain't sore at me, Mr Jordan. I mean, me coming down here to see you. But it makes a mother sort of proud, having a boy in the army. You're crocked to your eyeballs. Honest I ain't, Mr Jordan. Then what did you come down here for? Since I'm sort-of your mother. I thought you'd like to know I'm broke. A shakedown, huh? It must be worth something. That lawyer said he would get you a nice, soft job. I don't think you'd get it if they knew you lied about your mother. I paid you off once. It didn't last long. I had house-guests. So you want me to keep you in gin the rest of your life? Honest, Mr Jordan. Things are tough. I've been working hard. But people are buying war-stamps with their quarters now. How much do you want? For a hundred, I can see my way clear. I'll give you fifty but not another cent. Can you make it seventy-five? Come on. Blow. Goodbye, son. I told you to blow. Get out and don't come back. Goodbye, dearie. You haven't had your cold drink yet. I don't think I want it now. I couldn't help seeing what happened. Please don't be upset. A lot of the boys are edgy when they first get here. That's alright, dearie. Goodbye. The idea of a man treating his mother that way. I didn't ask her here. - You're disgusting. I'll report you. Why? I've been here long enough to know that nobody spends all day in the canteen. You're AWOL. - Wait a minute, sister. How much do you make here? - Why? Whatever it is, I'll double it if you keep your mouth shut. This is the man, Colonel. - What's your unit, soldier? Woodpeckers Of America. What's yours? Come on, Jordan. You've got a visitor at MP Headquarters. Man, woman or what? - It's your lawyer. Yeah? In that case, better start packing my things. You can talk in here. - Hello Lucky. How are things? How do they look? I'll be out of this ice-box in three days. What you doing about that job in New York? Lucky, I've done my level best. I've pulled strings like a puppeteer. But I can't do a thing. Not good enough, Higgins. It didn't used to be hard to fix the City or the State. But you can't fix Washington. To begin with, you can't find who's in charge. Okay, Higgins .. I'm breaking out of here. That's ridiculous. You've only three days to go. Go where? I'm not staying in this army. I've got money stashed all over the country under six different names. I'm sitting this war out some place where they can't find me. With a blond in one hand, and a steak in the other. But that's desertion. I'm not a finicky man. I can close my eyes to lots of things. But desertion in time of war? This is the kiss-off, Higgins. - Lucky. Don't try anything. At least not until I go. They may say it's collusion. I may end up in the penitentiary. You'll be right at home with the rest of your clients. Hey, Sergeant. - What's up? Plenty. Take a look at this man's left-hand pocket. My pocket? - What's he got there? Take a look. I haven't got a thing in my pocket. Not a single, solitary thing. Except a .. a golf tee. See. That isn't what I saw. Let's have a look in there. Lucky. Get away from that door. Now you've involved me. - Yeah. I wish I could stick around and see what excuse you'll use to get out of this. Take it easy will you, Lucky. Look .. look, I didn't have anything to do with this. I'll show you the way out, sir. - I know the way out. Don't use the main gate. The convoy's leaving. Use the side gate. Alright. You got your pass-out ticket? - Yes. Fine. Turn left by those buildings. Right. Go ahead. What goes on? - It's a stick-up. I thought I recognized you when you passed me on the highway. I followed you just to be sure. You're AWOL again. Get out of my car. - Sorry sister, mine seems to be hot. Did you hear what I said? Get out of here. Where are you going? - Over the hill. You're not taking me with you. Do you realize this is kidnapping? What are you talking about? You're so crazy about me, you followed me. Look. If you want my car, take it. But let me out. You're too nosy. You go around reporting people. Stop, or I'll throw this out. Wasn't mine, anyway. Just how long do you intend to keep me with you? Until I'm in the clear. In case you're interested, you're almost out of gas. You won't get very far, my friend. When they catch you they put you in the guardhouse for the rest of your life. Hey. It's after seven. There isn't a station open in the east. We sleep here tonight and get gas when they open in the morning. Go to sleep .. the minute you do, I'm leaving .. Get out. What are you going to do with me? - Going to bed you down for the night. No, thank you. - I said, get out. No you don't. You can't put me in there. Listen cute-eyes, is that fair? How do you know you won't like it until you've been inside? I'll be good. I promise I won't try to run away. You might walk in your sleep. Let me go. Do you hear? Put me down. Do you hear? Put me down. Please don't. I'll sleep in the car. I'm sleeping there myself. There's not much room but I'm willing to split it with you. That's very nice of you. But I'll go in here. Look .. what good will it do to do to keep me locked up? You don't go anywhere in the morning. You can't get any gas. You haven't got a ration card. That's right. But you must have one. Where is it? They didn't give me one. I was full of gas. Okay. I don't mind looking for it. Never mind, I'll give it to you. There you are. Let me out of here! Open the door. Where are you? - Now, what's the matter? You can't leave me in here. It's dark. - Turn on the light. I can't find it .. give me some matches. The guy who owns this coat don't smoke. He hasn't got any matches. But he does have a gas card. Let me out of here. Used to be people didn't even get out of the car when I put the gas in. Nowadays, they're all over the place. Squeezing the hose, to be sure to get the three gallons. How did you come to get one of these C-books? You an official? I'm a .. dog catcher. - You don't say. Do they get them too? Did you ever try catching a wire-hare on foot? I'll get you the change. Good afternoon, Mr Jordan. Lucky. Hello Slip. I see you're taking things over from me okay. Run along Pearl. Hey. You've lost weight. I've been awfully worried about you Mr Jordan. Yeah, I noticed you just had a fainting spell on the couch. It's good to see you again, boss. I hope you don't mind my clowning around with Pearl a little. Why should I mind? It's no good letting a dame with red hair cool off. How come you ain't wearing your soldier pants? I left them in that camp. I figured the guy who's staying in the army might need them. How hot are you? I don't know. About six miles out from camp two guys in a big car jumped me. Yeah? I don't know what they were after, but they seemed satisfied with a .. A couple of right-crosses. Where's that briefcase, Lucky? How do you know about that? - That can come later. Where is it? Listen, almond-eyes. When you ask me a question your voice better go up on the end. I didn't mean nothing like that, Lucky. But the briefcase is important. That's better. Now, get out of that chair and tell me how you know so much. I sent those guys who jumped you. Of course, they didn't know it was you. That guy you clipped back in the camp was an army engineer. That briefcase he was carrying was full of hot dope. New tank armor. Since when did you get interested in tanks? Look Lucky, in our business you've got to keep yourself up to date. Those dog tracks, and bookie joints and slot machines. They're old-fashioned now. They weren't bad. Maybe they'll be alright after the war's over. But right now, the heavy sugar is in something else. I ran into a couple of foreign lugs. They'll pay anything you want to ask. For stuff like the report on the tank armor you've been carrying around. That little briefcase is worth fifty .. thousand .. rocks. Yeah? Sure. You get a thousand bucks for just finding out where a troop train went. In American money? Sure. I got twenty thousand for setting an oil-rig on fire. Did you do that? No. But they don't know I didn't. You been doing alright, Slip. Thanks, boss. They're getting a little itchy about me not finding the briefcase, Lucky. Where is it? - I don't know. The dame I had with me threw it out of the car. Where? I didn't pay any attention. The dame must know where it is. Where is she now? I parked her with Joe Maggotti. Pick her up. I need a few grand to rattle in my pocket until I cool off. What was this dame doing with you? She saw me blowing the camp. I took her along to stop her squawking. You're treating her pretty gentle, eh Lucky? Best way to keep a dame from squawking is to break her squawker. How to you do, Mr Jordan. I'll tell Mrs Maggotti you're here. Hello Lucky. Hiya. Have a cup of tea? No thanks, Vera. Where's the dame I parked here last night? Upstairs. I'll get her for you. Make yourself at home. Twelfth Night. What happens then? You got me. You can come downstairs now. I won't do it. If anyone lays a hand on me I'll break this lamp on him. Come on. Mr Jordan's waiting. Well. No bargain. But better than staying here. Hello Lucky. See the paper today? Quit reading them, Joe. You can't believe a thing you see in them anymore. I hope this is not true. Don't sweat over that new suit, Joe. I'm leaving right away. You know, I like very much to help you out any time, Lucky. But this .. I don't like. Hello, cute-eyes. Take me out of this place. She's okay, Lucky. Now I know why you didn't break her squawker. Thanks for keeping her on ice. Goodbye, Vera. Goodbye, Lucky. About here, I think Slip. What do you say, cute-eyes? - This isn't it. That's what I wanted to know. You can stop here, Slip. You'll save us a lot of time if you tell us where you threw it. I'll kick it out of her boss. Do you really think I'd help you get hold of military information? How do you know what's in the briefcase? - It's pretty obvious. He escapes from an army camp by stealing a car. There's a briefcase in it that's not his. He doesn't even care when I throw it out. Now suddenly, it's very valuable. This dame is too smart to live. Never mind. We'll find it ourselves. You walk along the road. We'll take this field. Come on. Walk in front of me. Thanks. Hey Slip. I got it. Coming. Good work, boss. Let's see it. Sure. It's 12 o'clock, Cinderella, I'm going to turn you into a squash. Am I going to love it. I've waited for you for a long time. I had a hunch you'd begun to like that big chair of mine. From now on, it's my big chair. You're all through, Lucky. You ain't a big-shot anymore. You're just a washed-up little drip. I thought you were getting too big for your pants. I meant to hammer you down but got busy with the army and let it slide. Bad business, letting things pile up on your desk like that. Proves you're getting old-fashioned. You're so out-of-date you ought to be retired. But, I'm doing you one favor. Just for old time's sake. Where do you want it? In the front or in the back? You're ahead of yourself, Slip. That briefcase is empty. What have you given me? Don't. Why not? - It's murder. Self-defense. - Please. If I let him go he wakes up with a headache and later I get it in the back. If I give him another kick he misses a headache and I don't get it in the back. Lucky. You can't do it. What will you do with that? What do you think? I think a lot of things. I hoped you were going to return it. A pretty long ride back to camp. Don't you see? If you return it now they won't press charges. I say there was no kidnap. You'll be square with everyone. Yeah. I'll be square behind the 8-ball and back in the army. At a time like this you can't sell your country short. I'm not selling anything short. I won't take a cent less than a hundred grand for this. Listen cute-eyes. Never look where you're diving. It tips off which way you're going. You can't get any more of those. Stockings, I mean. It's time to put you up for the night. You won't do that to me again? Sure. - Please don't. You being so nosy and patriotic there's nothing else I can do. I'll be good, I won't try to run away. - I can't take that chance. Come on. At least, let me have a cigarette first. Thanks. How can you do this? - What? Sell that information to the other side. - Why not? You are absolutely un-moral. You haven't faith in anybody or anything. I shouldn't think it would be worth it. You must feel .. miserable and alone. Me? I'm never alone. I spend every night in a nightclub with a show going on. You don't know what I'm talking about. Sure I do. You're trying to talk me out of selling the briefcase. You bet I am. You think this war has nothing to do with you .. but it has. The whole world is involved and everybody in it. If we lose, we'll end up slaves. Nazi slaves. That means you too. Whether you like it or not. No it don't. When things change a smart guy figures out a new angle. It's the klutzes who go around getting their heads knocked off. You never had an idea in your life where you didn't figure the angles first. I mean, what it meant to you and what you thought you could get out of it. Anybody who don't is a sucker. Very well then. Let's take it step by step. Let's find out what the angles are for you in this thing. You're established in whatever business you're in. You seem to like it and you make a lot of money at it. I'm doing okay. To be completely realistic and selfish. You want to keep things pretty much the way they are. Don't you? Yeah. Then you want the country you live in to win, don't you? Sure I do. Now we're getting someplace. Alright. If you want the country you live in to win, why aren't you helping? The way I see it. It's like a fight at The Garden. You may want the guy with purple pants to win and may bet a few bucks on him. But you don't want it enough .. That you'll climb in the ring and get your face bashed in helping him. I give up. You're impossible. I can't appeal to you on any basis. Animal, vegetable or mineral. Or human. I guess it's time to lock you up in the blue room again. Would you mind if I washed my face in the stream first? No. Go ahead. Let me up. Alright. Come on, get up. Go ahead. I don't get you. I thought at least I'd have to spar a few rounds. What does it matter? It don't. It's just that some dames are hard to convince. I guess I had you figured out all wrong. I thought you were a regular ice-cube until I kissed you. Even an ice-cube has to be .. Defrosted one in a while. Goodnight. Ahh. What's the matter? - There's something in there. Hey, come on. Open it up. Just a minute now. Mr Jordan, I wouldn't have this happen for the world. He was just .. - I know what he was doing. At the office tomorrow, you tell Slip to meet me at Marty's Place on 42nd street. I'll be there at noon. If he has a hundred grand in cash he gets the briefcase he's so crazy about. You got that straight? Yes, I have Mr Jordan. - Okay. Mr Jordan, please don't misunderstand about this man. Because he's only .. I know. He's your 'cousin'. When he wakes up, you tell him your 'uncle' was here. Can you spare a quarter, mister? Could you spare a quarter, mister? Cheapskate. Mr Jordan, please. I have something to tell you. Come on, blow. They're staked out all round Marty's, waiting for you. Who's staked out? - A bunch of torpedoes. I saw them when I went by. I thought I'd tell you in case you wasn't expecting them. Is Slip Moran with them? - If he is, he ain't advertising it. Thanks. Better be careful where you hide out, Mr Jordan. I'll take care of it. - But you're hotter than a stove. Everyone's after you. Slip Moran, the FBI, the Army and some big-shot who says you got his dog. Come on. Blow. I'm trying to say you can hide out at my place if you want. Nobody would think to look for you there. Where is your place? - Over the Green Apple on Folsom Street. Is there room for me there with all those gin bottles? I don't think you can be too choosy. Okay, let's have your key. Could you spare a quarter, mister, for a cup of coffee? I think so. Yes. Two bits for a cup of coffee? You wouldn't want me to dine in the cheaper places, would you? Hello, Mr Jordan. Glad you're making yourself comfortable. - On this sofa? How's business? I never saw as many cheapskates in my life. I knocked off early. Hope you got something to eat in that bag. I got some stew on the stove. All I got to do is warm it up. Do you like stew, Mr Jordan? I'd rather have guinea-hen and a glass. If that's all you got I won't turn it down. I passed Marty's after you left and hit one of them torpedoes for a quarter. He was waiting for you alright. He gave me four bits to keep moving. I haven't any cash, but I'm working on a deal right now. If I put it across I'll slip you a couple of C's. You don't need to. What you giving me? Think you'll get more out of Slip? If that's the way you feel you can get out of here. I don't get it. I didn't tell you to come here so I could put the bite on you. No? Doing me a favor free of charge? Not exactly. Kind-of hard to explain. Something happened the day I went to the camp to shake you down. Everybody was so nice to me when they found out I had a boy in the army. Then, on the train, I met a couple of other mothers. They was lying about their kids. I wasn't going to let them get away with anything. So I started lying about you. And I topped them all. I froze them up alright. Yeah? What'd you tell them? I told them you'd never been away from home before. But in three months you was already a Lieutenant. They grassed around a little. Then started flashing baby pictures. You know the kind, little monkeys naked. They thought they had me there. So, I just cracked open a newspaper. And showed them a picture of a good-looking soldier. For a minute they thought they'd nailed me. As it said 'Captain' in the picture. So I said: well, what do you know? He's got himself promoted again. That's when they froze. When I saw you today it hit me like a ton of bricks .. That you was walking into a trap. I did just what a mother would do. It felt good to know you needed me. And I can do something for you. Don't get so tied up in the 'mother' act that you tell folk I'm back home again. They couldn't get anything out of me with a crowbar. Where can I hide this? - Under the mattress. That's the first place anybody would look. I got just the place. How do you like that? I asked the landlord to fix it. He says for what I pay I'm lucky to have a room. It'll do. Ain't that a pretty shawl? I got that at one of the big department stores on 5th Avenue. It dropped into my umbrella one rainy day. Yeah? Where'd you get the umbrella? Out of the umbrella department. Why didn't you walk past a couple of steaks tonight? When it comes down to it, there's nothing like good home cooking. Especially if he can't get out to a restaurant. Is it alright? Got enough pepper? Enough salt? Got enough pepper and salt, but it's a little bit shy on meat. But ain't I the stupid one. I gave it all to myself. I have to go out after a while. I want you to stay in and watch things. You think you ought to go out? - Yeah. It's business. With the money you've got, you shouldn't go risking your neck for a few dollars. With all the money I got I don't dare show my face in a bank. That's why I've got to put this deal through. Want some more? - Same as this? Sure. No thanks. I've got to get going. Sorry there ain't a desert. We was to have pineapple but the grocer looked around. Hello, Slip. I didn't keep my appointment today as I don't like double-crossers. Give me one more chance. I'll meet you tomorrow at 11 o'clock in a toy store on 5th Avenue. It's no use framing me. I won't have the stuff. Yeah. You get it when you fork over a hundred grand in cash. What will it be, gentlemen? Open up the cash register, and shut your mouth. Back room for you, El Ropo. Put Slip Moran on. This is Harrison. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - It's me. Open up. I've been having the quick-jumps. - Relax. It was just a phone call. What's that? I brought you a Mother's Day present. You didn't? - I said I did. Gin. That's the sweetest thing a kid ever gave his mother. Don't get stiff. Thanks, Mr Jordan. Come on. Blow. I have to get to bed. Goodnight .. son. Goodnight. Ma. And remember. I don't care how you get it. Understand? We can't keep these in stock. Amusing, isn't it? - Yeah. It's kinda cute. Boys just love it. A 3-year-old can operate it. Yeah? Let me take a crack at it. - Certainly. If you're not too busy I'd like to talk to you. Hello Lucky. It's a great little gadget. Let me show you how it works. Another time. I got a hundred thousand things I want to take care of today. I'll take it. I'll have one wrapped for you. I'm sure the little boy will love it. Will there be anything else, sir? - Go on, blow. I want to talk to the little boy. I like this place. How come I had to meet you here? Figured if any of your friends drop in they'd be kinda conspicuous. Bring the dough? - You bring the thing? I told you I wouldn't have it with me. Kind-of a one-sided deal, ain't it? Now look. We went through that on the phone. Give me the dough and you get the stuff before midnight tonight. I don't know. I talked to them foreign lugs until I was black in the face. They won't pay that kind of dough. Well, they just won't get it. [ Police siren ] A fine thing for a kid to play with. Nope, Lucky. They won't pay a cent more than .. seventy-five grand. Alright, give me the seventy-five. Wait a minute, I got to talk to them. How'd I know you was going to take it? What is this, a stall? Trying to double-talk me until someone gets here with a Tommy-gun? The only Tommy-guns in this joint shoot corks. Look goose-neck. I don't know what you're trying to frame but I'll give you one last chance. Meet me here at five this afternoon. Be sure to have the seventy-five grand on you or I burn the stuff. Okay, Lucky. If I don't show, you know the deal fell through. I got a feeling that you got a feeling the deal is going to fall through. You know these foreign lugs. It ain't like you and me dealing. Yeah. With you, I'd know exactly what to expect. That's why you don't get your hands on the stuff until I get mine on the dough. And ten makes twenty. Thank you, sir. I just wish I could see the little boy when he gets it. The little boy don't know it yet. But he's already got it. Son. - What happened? Be careful. A couple of men come. Looking for that briefcase. Slapped me around something awful. I didn't tell them where it was. They couldn't make me tell. I'll take care of Slip for this. I'll take care of those foreign lugs too. Watch out. They're mean guys. The stuff they want so bad is going to where it hurts them most. Right back to the army. Why don't you go back too? If you set your mind to it. You could be a better soldier than any of them. I'll get a doctor. You'll be alright for a while? - Uhuh. Get that briefcase out of here now. Yup. Go and get it. I'll be alright. Son. Okay. Ma. Son .. son .. are you alright, son? You scared me, Mr Jordan. What happened here? Where's Slip? - I haven't any idea. This morning he upped and moved. Now I'm out of a job. Where'd he move to? - I don't know. What are you doing back here? - I left my earrings up here somewhere. You'd better tell me where Slip is. - Honest, Mr Jordan. I don't know. They haven't let me in on anything. I think maybe Slip's gone straight. Don't give me that. Honest, Mr Jordan. I think he started a nursery or something. I mean for flowers. Flowers are all he talks about. I guess there's a lot of money in it too. Just this morning he sold some tulips for fifty-thousand dollars. That's an expensive bouquet. What kind of tulips were they? - I can't remember. Come on, heat that red head up. It's important. All I have to go on. It was 'Torch Of ..' something. 'Torch Of Holland'. That's what it was. - Who'd he sell them to? I don't know. I'd tell you if I did. Okay. I'll be at the same place until the 18th. Why don't you come see me? Some other time, Pearl. I'm avoiding crowds right now. Yes, sir? I need information about a tulip. It's called the 'Torch Of Holland'. Sorry. We haven't had those bulbs since the war started. Know where I can find any? - Afraid not. A very rare variety. But we have a lovely California bulb that's almost the same color. There's just a little more pink on the petals. No thanks. If I could find one how much would it cost? I should say about fifteen dollars a bulb. I know one that cost fifty thousand. Liar. There's a possibility you might find one at the Kilpatrick Gardens. They have the most elaborate displays around here. Yeah? Where's that? - On Long Island. Beyond Rockaway. Far beyond. Thanks. You can't leave through the garden, sir. It's almost closing time. I just want to look at the tulips. - Take the path to the right. Got the names on them? - Everything in the garden is labelled. Is there a telephone here? - Not a public phone. It's very important. - Local call? I want to call the FBI in New York. This is a house-phone. I'll get you a line. Thanks. Please hurry. Hello. This is Miller at the gate. There's a lady here wants to contact the FBI. Will you please connect me? Thank you. Here you are, Miss. - Thanks. Hello? Hello, is this FBI? Let me speak to Mr Hearndon please. Mr Hearndon's not in. But my name is 'Bowman'. May I help you? Yes. This is Jill Evans. I've followed Jordan to the Kilpatrick Gardens. On Long Island. If you hurry you'll catch him. We'll get there as soon as we possibly can. In the meantime you'd better go direct to Mr Kilpatrick. And explain the situation to him. He'll have to hold Jordan until we arrive. That's fine. Okay. Goodbye. What's up, Kilpatrick? I'm now a member of the FBI. At least for the next half-hour. I doubt if you'll get away with it. Your face isn't stupid enough. I can be convincing. I had better go to my room. I always laugh at tragedies. And cry at comedies. Come in. A young lady. A Miss Evans to see you, sir. Yes. Show her in Charles. Show her in. - Certainly, sir. See you at dinner, Kesselman. Definitely. I'm hungry as a Frenchman. Miss Evans, sir. Good afternoon. - Sorry to bother you, Mr Kilpatrick. Mr Bowman of the FBI asked me to see you. Bowman? How is he? I don't know him. Just spoke to him on the phone. See, there's a man in your gardens who the FBI want very badly. Hey you. You got a tulip here called 'Torch Of Holland'? That block. What's so special about it? - Very rare. Sorry, sir. This greenhouse isn't open to the public. I saw a man go in there. - You must be mistaken, sir. Mr Kilpatrick keeps his prize flowers in here. He doesn't allow anyone inside. That's the closing bell, sir. You'll have to go now. They rang the bell for us to leave. Now you won't let us leave. Why is that? It'll be just a few minutes sir. There's been some trouble. I'm not in trouble. I want to go. Is he here? No. He isn't. Has anyone gone out Miller? - Not for the last 15 minutes. You people can go then. Sorry I had to keep you. This means he's still in the grounds. - Maybe he'll go over your wall. Not that wall. If he gets to the top, he'll find the wires carry a pretty stiff current. Pull all the gardeners together and have them search the grounds thoroughly. You'll find a man hiding somewhere. - Yes, sir. Don't worry. We'll catch your fugitive. Wiley, take Miss Evans to the house. Have Charles fix a drink for her. I'll be with you in a few minutes. I must check the grounds myself. Thank you, Mr Kilpatrick. - Not at all. One tank looks like another to me. Then I'm not an engineer. Kesselman is. I'll let him study these tonight. If he says they're alright you get your money tomorrow. You know, this was a tough job. - I know. You've done it very well. Ready for another assignment right away? - Always like to keep busy. A trainload of precision machinery leaves for the west coast tomorrow. I wouldn't mind seeing it derailed. Okay. Same code: 'Torch Of Holland'? It's getting a bit late in the season for tulips. Let's make it gardenias this time. I'll send you a wire saying the gardenias have been shipped. There he goes. Get him. Not over those tulips you idiots. You can chase him on the grass. Will you let me in please? I left my umbrella inside. Sorry, sir. It's against the rules to let anyone in after hours. Then don't let me in. It's around the gate somewhere. Just hand it to me. I'll see if it's in the gatehouse. Are you sure you had it with you? If you don't produce my umbrella I call the police. Here it is. - Thank you. I'm sure. That stupid oaf. I bet he has a fine collection of purses, gloves and umbrellas. Probably does a brisk business selling them. You weren't so impressive, Clarence. You shouldn't antagonize people. The man didn't know it was there. If I weren't aggressive, people would be walking all over me. I wouldn't be assistant credit manager. There. After all your talk about fine weather. It's started to rain already. Maybe you still think I was silly. To go back after my umbrella. What is it, Clarence? - Listen to this. 'Take this to FBI'. 'Send them to gardens'. 'Hurry'. This is extraordinary. What will you do? What will I do? What am I going to do? I'll throw it across the wall of course. But it must be important. That's how you get in trouble. Interfering in something that doesn't concern you. If I took it to the FBI they'd probably arrest me as a spy. Help. Mr Kilpatrick. I've got him. Mr Kilpatrick, I've got him. Help. Stop that! Get away from there. Alright. Get your hands up. Now get over there. Thank you, Miss Evans. What you doing with this bunch of spies? Sorry you're put to this trouble, Mr Kilpatrick. Not at all. Not at all. I'm glad to help. Charles, ask Mr Kesselman to come downstairs. Yes, sir. May I use your phone? I must call my father to tell him where I am. I'm afraid not. - What? You see. You now know so much about my business interests. That. I can't let you go. But I talked to the FBI. They told me to see you. You talked to me on the house-phone. Too bad, cute-eyes. Sit down, Miss Evans. Charles tells me the guests arrived. - Yes. I'm certainly glad this one came. And this must be the notorious Mr Jordan. This is up to you, Moran. I don't consider that report delivered. You have to get it if you want your fifty thousand. You better talk while you still got teeth to talk through. We'll just addle his brain that way. What do I care what I do to his brain? You want him to remember what he did with that report, don't you? Well, there are better ways. In Poland. We found this worked very well. You drive these under the fingernails. And light them. We used to call it the Danzig Hotfoot. A pure Pole will stand a lot of heat. Americans are such mongrels. Nothing personal. It will be interesting to find out how quickly they break. Wait a minute. So soon? I'll tell you where it is. You have no stamina at all. Have you? Where is it, Lucky? I threw it under the bridge that goes over the pond. I'll get it. I'll come with you, Moran. You two. Better come with us. You keep your eye on him. You know. This is a revelation. I know we Nazis are often referred to as gangsters by our opponents. It's always amused me. I've read about American gangsters. It seemed to me that their viewpoints and ours .. Were quite similar. I was told that when they wanted something .. They took it. So do we. When somebody stood in our way he was eliminated. We understand that technique. Thoroughly. So you imagine my shock, Mr Jordan. When I finally meet a gangster like you. A prominent gangster. I discover you are weak. And spineless. No. I'm no longer amused by the comparison. Don't try to put me in your class, square-head. I've knocked around a little, but beside you I'm a Sunday-School teacher. You are an uncouth .. jackal. That's what you are. Let's talk of something more pleasant. Miss Evans. Cigarette? Don't smoke? Are you acquainted with the Nazi party's estimate of American women? No. And I don't care to be. Well. We say they are sleek and very well cared for. But, with no souls .. whatsoever. But the lack of soul doesn't seem to bother that drooling idiot. I must say. It doesn't bother me either. After all, how do we know there is such a thing as a soul? But the existence of legs. That's something tangible. Something you can put your finger on. Philosophically speaking. In that regard, my principal objection to submarine travel is that you have .. Sixty men. Twelve torpedoes. But no women. In the last war I was 25 years younger. And stationed in Vienna. I fought the war diligently. From ten-to-five in daytime. And from ten-to-five at night, being statistically minded. I made a census of all the beautiful women in Vienna. We lost the war. But I had my census. This war has been too frantic. They're taking every city in Europe overnight. I just had myself set for Paris. When I was transferred to the espionage department. Three days later I found myself .. In a cold submarine somewhere under the North Sea. I cheered up considerably when I was told we were going to Florida. But when we arrived there a man rolled out and handed me a package. We submerged and headed for the North Sea again. Alright. Stay where you are, sauerkraut. Alright, you get up there with him. Nice going, cute-eyes. Who fired that shot? What's happened? Hello boys. Get your feet wet? How'd you let this happen, Kesselman? I'm afraid this lout knows more about petunias than guns. This seems to be an impasse, Jordan. You can't get out of here without my setting off the alarm and catching you. As long as you hold that gun I can't get very far either. I should say about a step and a half. Exactly. I suggest we make a deal. You wanted a hundred thousand for that report. Didn't you? Well, now I'm prepared to pay. This is the pay-off alright. But not the way you mean it. You boys are going to get paid off in slugs. I don't blame you for being sore, Lucky. But it's nothing to settle with a gun. He offered you a hundred grand. Ain't that what you want? I got a customer I like better. I'm selling to the army on the instalment plan. They're going to pay me fifty bucks a month for it. Yes. But aren't you a little confused, Jordan? A man of your stamp can't get anything out of being a tin-horn hero. Why give up a hundred thousand dollars for the sake of a country .. That considers you an enemy of society? Maybe because I don't want to see that country .. Run by a bunch of guys who go around beating up old women. Until I ran up against you 'Nazi' was just a word in a newspaper to me. Now, it's another way to spell 'cockroach'. This place needs cleaning up. For the next two minutes, I'm a one-man board-of-health. Lucky, you and me were pals. That's why I'm giving it to you first. Where do you want it? Drop it. - Lucky, it's Mr Hearndon. Hey. Anybody hurt? - No. Jordan. Nice of you to be here too so we get you all at once. Wait a minute. Who was it sent that report out of here in the little squirt's umbrella? Think up a better one than that. But Mr Hearndon, he had these men all rounded up when you came in. Better come along anyway, Jordan. Until we get this straightened out. This always happens. You try to help a guy and the referee hits you over the head with a stool. Alright. Let's take this menagerie downtown and lock it up in a cage. You haven't anything to worry about. Hear what he said about the cage? I'll tell them what you did. They won't keep you. If you worry about the army, forget it. They won't think you're a deserter now. Come along, Jordan. You might even get a citation. What's that? - You know .. a medal. Hey you guys, get your backs into it. Come on, Jordan. Get going. Hey you. Where do you think you're throwing that? Sorry. I thought it was your face. Say, listen here. ..t-g..
