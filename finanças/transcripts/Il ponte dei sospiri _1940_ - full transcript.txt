Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS Push! Push against the storm! Under the whipstaff! Does it hurt? Yes. And I could've been spared it. If only the order to cease battle had come an hour earlier. I'd have gladly given both my arms, and even my life to not fly before those dogs! Then why didn't we attack? So the Turks could sing victory? Heavy seas and headwinds. - And the jealousy of Charles V. He wouldn't like Venice to rule the Adriatic. Any excuse is good. - Keep quiet! For shame! Of what? I've done my duty as much as Captain Rolando. You speak as if you weren't a Venetian! There was a moment I thought Rolando would throw himself in the sea. And you looked pleased! He'll soon console himself on land. Go to?! The lion of Venice? Where is Rolando? - He's below deck. He can't get over it. He says today in Venice's history, a page of shame has been written. And that his father will blush at the Republic's humiliation. Rolando is right. But it's not our fault Andrea Doria put boldness before prudence. Besides, we cannot judge our leaders. There he is. Look how distraught he is. The lion of Venice? Sing, sailor! Sing, sailor. ?was left without a head, which he lost at sea, which he lost her at sea. Cease with that song of ill omen! I'll sing as long as I got voice! The lion of Venice? Sing, sailor? One question, my dear Negroni: Are you sure you're not deceiving yourself? Why? I think of the rivalry of the two families? and I can't understand how a Candiano and a Grado? could've gotten so close to each other. Rolando is an unscrupulous schemer. Beware, thwarted love is the strongest. But my will is stronger than their love. And I shall even avenge you. Just watch. - I thank you. You hate him as much as me. I hate him as a rival who might rise again. But for you, he'd be the obstacle which would upset all your plans. The Grado and the Candiano will never intermarry! Besides, I've already foreseen all. One just needs to smash the idol. - I don't understand. You will tomorrow, when Rolando returns. As much as Venice has been absorbed and silent these days, they'll shout their indignation tomorrow. I want Rolando to feel the people are against him, despise him. The fascination destroyed, I'll destroy the man. It's obvious. But the people love him. - D'Avila, how naive you are. It's precisely because they love him. It's enough to insinuate that he betrayed them. That he didn't hesitate to rise against Andrea Doria. It won't take much. And I'd be unworthy of power, if I didn't know how to use it. Make way! Go away, Rolando! Long live Rolando! Long live Rolando! They were supposed to lead us to victory! And they didn't fight! - They betrayed Venice! Forward, forward, as God wills it. Forgetting to dream, because the honor? all glories go away? Ginevra, you here? - Yes, Madonna Imperia sends me. What does she want? - She awaits, begs you to see her. There's no reason to do so. If you knew how much she prayed for your safety, you wouldn't say that. I thank her. - There, look. Rolando? Where are you going, Imperia? - Oh, Monsignor? Surely, not to see me. Indeed, I didn't know you were here. If I mistake not, you're a bit agitated. Me? No. Then what? I heard the shouting, the uproar, and I wanted to see. There. This way, we won't be disturbed. Imperia, I must speak to you at length? and in all seriousness. - Yes? Can you guess what for? - It'd be quicker to tell me. It's about your loyalty. Why? Do you have anything to reproach me for? I have no reason to doubt you. But, you see, love has always held the first place in your life. And today, that worries me. I don't understand. To what are you referring to? - Should I give a name? I'd be grateful. Because, I'm truly starting to be confused. Rolando Candiano! - Rola?? Monsignor, what madness! Rolando Candiano! You laugh too much, Imperia. - Of course I do. I didn't think you were jealous. Not jealous. But I plume myself on knowing women's hearts. - And so? Rolando Candiano has returned to Venice. He might have the unlucky idea to seek you out. - I doubt it. Yet, it'd be easy to meet. Even if that were so, I wouldn't be to blame. - True. But curiosity sometimes is a very bad counselor. And I want to put you on your guard. Beware, Peter D'Avila will not stomach such an affront! Oh, Monsignor, why would I reward your care so poorly? What do I care now about Rolando Candiano? That is the past. He no longer interests me. I have no affection for Candiano, but the hostility of the people has truly exceeded the limit. Rolando is a captain worthy of respect. The people have heard of his disrespect towards Andrea Doria. He seems to have tried to raise the crew against our great admiral. This, combined with the defeat, has irritated the Venetians. We must calm their spirits. The Senate can do it and you first? Msgr Grado. - You bring me news of His Highness? Yes, Monsignor. Unfortunately, it is not what we all hoped for. The fever persists and his strength now abandons the Doge. He is in agony. - In a time like this, with the city in turmoil? It's necessary to convene the Council of the Ten right away. Right. Take courage, I beg you, dry your eyes. What would your father say if he saw you like this? Oh, Angiola, all that crowd crying against him. I told you it wasn't prudent to go out. If I could just reach him. Don't worry, I'll go to Rolando's before evening. And I'll find a way for you to meet. Angiola! May I pay my respects, Eleonora? Thank you, Monsignor. Where did you come from? Did you go to the arrival of the galleys as well? I would not approve. Just as I am certain your father wouldn't approve if he knew. I've been to church. You don't know how to lie. And that's why I adore you. Monsignor? Oh, don't worry, I won't be indiscreet. This is not the time for madrigals. But tomorrow, I'll have the joy of seeing you. Your father has done me the honor of an invitation. And we must speak about us. Dear son! It wasn't like that, you know? I never dreamed about coming back like this. I wanted to be worthy of the Candianos. I wanted you to be proud of me. - Say no more. Your worth isn't in question. - For you, but not the Venetians. You should've seen Saint Mark's Square: A crowd of brutes singing, mocking. Searing words that leave their mark like a lash. Very few can understand. And let me tell you, if I hear again one more word against Rolando, as true as my name's Scalabrino, I'll make a massacre! And remember, that there are two of us! Hey! According to you one can't even say the truth? The truth is that you're a bunch of cowards! - Bravo! Shut up! - Cowards! We weren't the ones in Prevesa! - What about it? I'd look elsewhere for the cowards and mind you, I'm not excluding anyone! Rolando Candiano? Watch out, Scalabrino! Fear not, Scalabrino, I'm here! What is it? The Doge is dead. - The Doge dead? Why are you smiling? Because of the miraculous coincidence of our ideas. It seems you've read my mind. - I'm flattered. But what are you referring to? To the activity of Rolando Candiano. Isn't that it? - It is. You see how we agree? I wish we were on another point. - Namely? That any means is good as long as the end is achieved. But what are you waiting for to get rid of that troublemaker? I'll answer you at once. Bartoli! - Monsignor? Have you taken care of what I asked you? You may speak. Yes, Monsignor. - Trusted people. When will it take place? - Tonight. It's all arranged. Mind, you answer to your leader. - I know. Go. You are unequaled. And Lando Grado will be the new Doge of Venice. Have you seen Sandella? - Yes, he said you wanted me. What is it? - Not here. Come to my house later. - At your house? What if it's something dangerous? - Then you better go to bed. Hey, does he know who I am? Careful. Go away and come back tomorrow on time. Marazza! Close the door! Pull the curtain! Help me! Mind that people are coming tonight. You must do us credit. Buy wine from Verona, the sparkling kind. You shall roast a goose and tender veal meat. And then marzipan, honeydew cakes and ripe fruit. There'll be many of us, remember, and there'll be women. Open your hand. - I didn't touch anything. It's just that I know you. It's vesper, you hear? Be quick. And make me look good! What? A list of courtesans? - Precisely. Are we all on it? - All. But what's it for? I find it a true impropriety. Barbarella, it's not an impropriety and you're wrong to be upset. It's very interesting. You know what it makes one think? Of the author's unworthiness. - Not at all. It makes one think of a nursery of flowers. And since next to each flower, there is an indication of a particular scent, this way they who consult it know at least how to choose. Surely, Imperia is less sensitive than you. I think she's resigned. Oh, you don't know Imperia. She'd be wrong. When a man lets me know he's tired of me, I'm the first to be on my way. Yes, but it's different for her: She's in love. Oh, as if Rolando were the only one in Venice! Have they all arrived? - I believe so, Madonna. Open the chest. God, what a mess! - You're so jealous about your things, I don't dare touch them! Oh, Madonna! A shame. How sorry I am. - It was for your daughter. I was going to send it to her at the cloister. Who knows how she waited for it, poor thing. I'll have to get another one. Put it in there. Tie it. You may go, Marta. Tell me, have you heard? Yes. - Well? I must grieve you. - Say it quickly. It's all true what they reported. - They see each other. Every night, Eleonora comes to the garden and Rolando joins her climbing over the wall. Who told you? - You must believe me. It's true. What are you doing? - Leaving. Are you mad? The hall's filled with people. - I don't care. There's Loredana, Barbarella, Piera, Matilde. Imagine the gossip. The dancers have arrived. Just right now. - I don't want to lose a moment. Invent a pretext. Say? Say, I'll be back shortly. You want me to go with you? - No, I go alone. Drink. - No. I prefer to get intoxicated like this. Here I am. - Bravo. Want a drink? No, tell me rather, what this business is about. Very easy, don't worry. - I don't work in the dark. We don't work in the dark! - What do you want? Don't you know me? - Who cares. Come, let's not waste time. - Walk this way. Well then? It's about performing a service for Msgr Negroni. We need to get out of the way one who troubles him greatly. No! For the moment, just kidnapping but later? if it's necessary, killing. - An ugly business. Leave it to me. - Shut up! The name? Rolando Candiano. Rolando Candiano? But Rolando? - You shut up! Will you stop it? Idiot! You think Rolando scares me? Don't open your mouth again, understand? When would it be? - Soon. Any moment. You know where he is? - I know all. And it's really an order? - An order from Bartoli. Of course, it's not as easy as you think. The Candianos are powerful. We could pay dearly for it. And who would find out? Bartoli won't breathe a word. You'll be eating well! If you don't want to, I'll find someone else. I want to do the job. It's a deal. Then? wait for me. Sorry, if I dare to open my mouth, but I don't understand anything anymore. - I see that. You, Scalabrino, who fought so many times for Rolando, are now against him? Now I'm ready to save him. Idiot! Damn, what talent! I don't know why they don't make you Doge. Don't worry, I'll be back in an hour. Be careful. You think this scar doesn't burn still? And he must pay! Mind you, Scalabrino is strong. And if he should find out? - He won't have time. He'll do the job and I'll have carried out Bartoli's order. I am the stronger! I have this. Let's go. - You go to bed. Please! I never sleep. - Let him come. He's good luck. Sandrigo's in a good mood this evening, eh? Certainly, tomorrow someone will cry. In order not to wake suspicion, it's better we split up. I'll stay here and watch your back. You seize him and bring him to me. You can do that easily by yourself. By himself? Ain't I here too? - Let's go! Sandrigo doesn't want to get into his head that I am somebody. He's a bad sort. Yes, but if you marked his left cheek, I'll mark his right. He'd never forgive you, like me. Row more slowly. Go faster. Pull over. What's that? A gondola. - Maybe it's him. A woman. - Some love intrigue. Were you seen? - Have no fears, the grounds are deserted. - I'm very frightened. If my father surprises us? How are we to blame if our families hate each other? I love you. You must be mine. Scalabrino, see how her necklace shines. Let's give it a tug. - You're mad. Let's do it: She screams, we run away with the shiny rock and Rolando is safe. You're not as beastly as I thought. But she's a woman and that repels me. We wouldn't hurt her. You know I'm gentle. We'll save Rolando, see? - But don't harm even one hair, OK? Bertuccio's word. Until tomorrow. - Yes, until tomorrow. Help! Help! Help? See how it shines. - But I heard her scream and she fell down. What did I tell you? But you know women. They yell over nothing. I plugged up her mouth and she fainted. Well, let's go. Imperia? Run away, Bertuccio! Stop! Where did you get the necklace? We found it and we wanted to hand it over to the guard. Ah, bravo. There are still some honest people. Give it here. - One moment, I want to deliver it myself. Fine. Let's go. Gondolier! Did you bring this woman? - Yes, Madonna Imperia. Help! Help! Help! And goodbye necklace. Rolando. You? I found you fainted on the ground. What happened to you? You, Rolando? Go on. Some bandits. But how come you were alone, at night in that deserted street? Are you incapable of explaining? - Didn't you understand? Nothing. Try again. We were waiting for Rolando where you told us. - And then? Then someone came by who wasn't Rolando. - No use telling me that. It is because we thought it was him and we went to meet him. It was Scalabrino who saw them and I saw the shiny? ? and the guards. - Did you take to your heels? No, the guards took to their heels but towards us and they stopped us. They wanted to know what we were doing. With my temper, my hands were itching. - And what did you do? I looked at Scalabrino. - Scalabrino? He fled with me behind. - The guards? After us. - Did they catch you? - No, I already told you! He threw one into the water, three he put to sleep, and two were still following me. But clever me, I hid and they went by without even seeing me. So Rolando's safe? And Scalabrino? - He didn't get caught, I'm sure. A shame! - What? I was going to give him a nice sum. But where can he be now? In my attic, I thought you knew. - In the Borghetto? Borghetto? Who's ever been there? At the Street of Slaves. - Excellent! Anyway, I know where to find him. But it's not prudent to show up just now. Good night! - Good night. Postreolo! And you, Zeno, hurry. The Street of the Slaves and don't lose sight of Bertuccio. Go! And Scalabrino? He put three to sleep and threw one into the canal. That'll be enough to put him in the "dark" for a year. We must notify the police. Stop or I'll have you flogged! I'll have you flogged! Imperia neglects us. She hasn't yet deigned to appear. It's obvious, Rolando is in Venice. You are mistaken. - Secrets from me? I know her too well to be deceived. Imperia is not like one of these. She's a dreamer. I'm sorry about your necklace. And here my mission ends. Thank you, I hope you'll come up. No, Imperia. You are safe now. What? Does this mean you're afraid of me? It's not that. - Then what? You said there's a party in your house. It's better I'm not seen. No one will see you. You won't need to cross the hall. It's tomorrow's backlash you must think about. Such a sudden disappearance will surely shock the people. Rolando had much to do with them. It'll be enough to cripple the investigation and give the desired recommendations to the Bargello. There. You see how easy that was? Nobody will suspect that you are here. To be sure. In any case, it wasn't necessary. You're not kind. I'm sincere. - And stubborn. It's been months since you've returned to Venice? and despite my every attempt, I owe it to chance the joy of being able to speak to you. You know we have nothing left to say, Imperia. Do you really love her so much? Please. - More than you loved me? Don't make me say how different she is. And dangerous too. How can you have forgotten? Why can't everything go back to the way it was? No. - I shouldn't tell you but tonight I was spying on you, as I've done a 1000 times before. That's enough, Imperia. I don't want to sound insensitive to your words. But don't insist. It's no use! That waxdoll has truly bewitched you! I forbid you to talk like that! Trust me! The little dove who ushers you into her house at night, and holds her father's hand because he is the Doge, and while deceiving Negroni, she deceives him with you! Perhaps, that's a lie too? What's true is that you are the last of women! That alone is true. My respects to Madonna Imperia. - Thank you, Sir. Good night. Rolando. It was he indeed. Bartoli, but then? - I don't understand. Allow me to accompany you. - No. This is my affair, please. To whom did you give the task? - To trusted people, Sir. How do you explain it? - I don't know but I'll find out. No, let's keep back. Who was here with you? - No one. Don't lie. I saw him. - Let go of me! Whore! Help? You killed him. To defend myself. It will be difficult to persuade the judges. There was a man with you. You betrayed him. Everything cries you guilty. Do you want to save yourself? I have the means. Could you help me escape? It would not take much. But in your dancing halls, you have guests. No one must suspect. Show yourself to your friends. I can't. I don't have the strength. Your life depends on it. He was the best of us all, and he was struck down by a murderous hand. If immense is our condolence, equally firm must be our hearts, the will to do justice, to punish the guilty. Fate has willed that this horrendous tragedy had a witness. And it was the categorical denunciation of this witness? that led to the offender's arrest. You shall now hear the accusation and have made clear the fast as lightning unfolding of the drama. Remember the high duty that is incumbent upon you. The judges wait to be enlightened to give their just verdict. Therefore, answer: Have you been in relations with the late Msgr Pietro D'Avila? Yes. Do you confirm that the trust, of which he constantly gave you proof, you responded to by forgetting your obligations? Respond! Do you confirm it? Yes. Say, if it is correct, that every night, a man was let into your house. It is correct. Who is he? The man whom I loved and who loved me. And why did this man kill? He was taken by my side, and the jealousy, the shock? The name of the murderer? - No! I can't. - His name, I tell you. The name! Rolando Candiano. No! I ask the most excellent judges, before they come to the verdict, if they have any other questions to ask. The urn. You may go. Hey, enough! It's bedtime! What do you have to complain about? Are you drunk? Yet you haven't seen wine in a while. It hurts? here! You as well? You're all in a hurry to die here. How did you get it? Open it! I'm suffocating! Rolando! Who are you? - Scalabrino. Were you the one lamenting? - I was but now it's somebody else. I fought a 1000 times for you. I know your deeds. I bring you freedom. - Me? Yes, let's go. There's not a moment to lose. In the morning, they'd come for you to? You understand me? Come on, hurry! Let's go. Alarm! Alarm! Believe me, Eleanor, you don't weigh all the privilege that has fallen to you? and I understand that you are a child? but try to reflect. You see, asking for your hand, Msgr Negroni honors our house. Pay me heed. Reflect. We shall resume our discourse when you are calmer. And now go, dear. I don't want to keep you any longer. Are you finished hammering? - Yes, I'm finished. Then, hearken to me: Change neighborhood. - Again? This is incredible! If fear were currency to spend, you'd be the richest in the Republic. It's not fear, it's prudence. Assume that Scalabrino is alive. - So? That one won't forgive. You should know that. Little ant brain! But why should he think it was I who denounced him, if when he soused the guard, three others were present? He'd think it was one of them, right? Yes, you say right but I wouldn't trust to that. And if were you, I'd be preparing the cups and tankards. Those people are coming soon. There. You hear that? On the occasion of the auspicious wedding of Madonna Eleonora Grado, the Doge, her father, decrees that for this month, all are exempted from paying taxes, those which correspond to five florins or less. Hey, the taxes! And who ever pays them? When's the wedding? - Day after tomorrow. Thanks, that's all I care about. Don't interrupt every moment! Let me finish! He's right! - Silence! Now then, let's be clear about these things, eh? The confidence of those above is more than ever before. Therefore, they? will not fail us. I demand? Is that clear? I demand?! Absolute obedience. Blind loyalty from everyone! From me too? Cheers, Sandrigo! Scalabrino! It's him, yes. - And Rolando has escaped. Has the cat got your tongue? Has the joy of seeing me alive made you dumb? Look at me. I'm the one from before. And you know why I came? To thank you. - No, what do you mean? I said to thank you. You are an invaluable informer for the guard. So zealous! You did not want the death of a poor guard to go unpunished and you flew to denounce the offender. You hoped to bury him in the pits. Too bad! You miscalculated. And now the two of us? Coward! Stop, Scalabrino! Remember that I need you. I didn't do a thing to him. See how he shakes like a leaf? - It's a lie! It wasn't me! We'll have time to talk it over, chicken! Scalabrino! Sir! I heard it all. The wedding's set for tomorrow. Who told you? - It's posted in the streets. Let's go, Scalabrino. Sandrigo! Have a restorative. Rolando used to always speak of her. How beautiful! - She looks like a Madonna! She's wan though. - To be sure, it's the emotion. Where's the procession going now? - The Doge's palace. Where else? Don't you know that all psalms end in glory? It's lunchtime. They're going home tonight. Will there be a torchlight procession? Torches? If that were the only thing! Why? What else? I hate myths. Ras tipi. And what does that mean? - "Today me, tomorrow him." All of Venice throbs in unison with your heart, Highness. And avows happiness to your daughter. Thank you. May Heaven will that I may give Venice the most shining proof of my gratitude, and with that, glory to the Republic. War? - Victory, I hope. Not one word or you are lost. Don't worry about the gondola, Sir. I'm steering. I'll have you arrested. - Do not move! Or you won't have time to regret it. And you, Eleanora, know well with whom you have agreed to share your destiny. With the man who condemned me when innocent! "Innocent," I say again. Because of his insane ambition, his boundless vanity. It wasn't me who killed D'Avila. I was not Imperia's lover, though you believed it. Pay him no heed. He lies, blackmails me. He knows well I'd never make a scandal right now. You dare to deny it? He had hoped to get you and that's why he casts your heart in dismay. Lies. I'm not here to humiliate those who had no faith in me. Nor am I here to take revenge on your crime. I want to appear before everyone with my head high as is my right. And you will restore the truth. I am a soldier. And I want to take up arms for my country's honor. Beware, these people are loyal to me. Not one word or they'll kill you. I understand you, Eleonora. But tell me you're as outraged as I am by that wretch's accusations. Why don't you answer me? Mind you, I cannot permit you to have the slightest doubt. And I am in my rights when I demand you? I too am in my rights. In the right to know. What? Could you possibly believe?? May your wish be just this one: To prove to me that Rolando Candiano lied. Prove to you? You ask me for proof? I don't see how it could degrade you, to refute a disgraceful accusation. But you do not reason, Eleonora. You put me equal to a murderer. It's only that which makes me not return to my father and keep silent for the time being. Don't you see by talking like that you do me the bloodiest of insults? And you think not of my suffering? My entire life is against your suspicion. Rolando Candiano's life also militates for him! You dare say that? I only ask you for the truth. - There's only one truth! The one that was made sacred by a sentence of death! And you do wrong to distrust it. That can be dangerous for you. Yes! Because if you don't forget these foolish maiden dreams, I, your husband, will put them out of your head! Until you have brought me the evidence I've asked for, you will be a stranger to me. And now leave me, I beg you. What has happened, Monsignor? A terrible thing. And I need to know if I can count on you. Always at your command, Sir. - Rolando's alive and in Venice. Mind, Bartoli, this time I'll show no mercy. Use any means you think, organize all that you need: Rolando must disappear. And I tell you, Messer Rolando, you mustn't move. You are safe here. And when all is ready, you will flee. Without seeing her again? - Without seeing her! Besides, I'll stay in Venice. I'll keep watch. You know I'm devoted to you. She's always before my eyes. By the side of that man? - And that's the reason why. You are engaged in a deadly game. It is necessary to play with cunning. Gentlemen, Venice is all an influx of people! They declared war! - War? Yes, in some streets, one can't pass. - And you want me to fly? You're a beast as always! Why a beast? I didn't declare war. Then say when will it be. - I'll have an answer in the morning. The boat is here. Now all we need to know is the inn. Maybe the Golden Rooster is the owner of the boat. You told him for tomorrow night? Yes, I explained it all to him. - See, Sir? All will be well. She insisted so much, Madonna. - What does she want from me? Advise me, Ginevra. I think you should receive her. Shall I remain? - No. No. Let her in, Marta. Ginevra, run to the cloister. Ask how my daughter is. I'm barely alive. Be prudent. - Yes. Do not marvel over my visit. I've come to speak to you? about Rolando Candiano. Yes, that a great injustice may be repaired. And I beg you to listen. Everybody thinks that he is dead or fled. Roland is alive and in Venice. In Venice? Yes. I have seen him. Can I believe you? When I have told you the reason which led me to come here, you will believe me. I know the truth. Rolando is innocent. I beg you to speak up. You alone can, for you alone have accused him. In fact, there were no other witnesses that night. And I carried out a very sad duty by testifying against him. It wasn't Rolando who killed D'Avila! I don't even ask you the reason for this hellish machination. Perhaps you're a victim yourself. But I beseech your conscience. The man who became your husband today was among his judges. He can tell you better than I. Don't evade my desperate urging. Answer me! Under what right do you address me with such language? And under what duty have you allowed lies to triumph? Oh, Madonna, if you have someone dear to you, I implore you, in the name of that affection, kneeling down? Please stop! Don't force me to repeat what I had to state at the trial. Then you refuse? I refuse to go along with your folly. You have no conscience! And God will punish you! You are sad, Messer Rolando. Eh, I understand you. Love! And what do you know about love? I'm really afraid to know about it. Are you in love? In love? That would be nothing. It's that I must kill someone. But?courage. Did you understand? Just say, "Messer Bertuccio," and they'll be at your command. Understood. - Remember: The Golden Rooster. Goodbye, Bertuccio. - Good luck. THE GOLDEN ROOSTER Messer? - Messer Bertuccio. Ah, is that you? Come in. Come this way. Here, this is your room. You will not be disturbed. Would you like something to eat? - No, thank you. Good night. - Good night. He must've fought like a lion. I was tied up but I heard his cries. And then, look there: It looks like a battlefield. You see I've found you? - What do you want? You have no idea, eh? Take that! My turn! Quick! Let's go! This way you'll remember: Scalabrino on the left and Bertuccio on the right! Hurry! They're killing one another! Let me pass. I must speak to his Highness! - I repeat: It's impossible. Ah, you. I must speak with the Doge. Lead me to him! - Let's go! Let me through! Let me speak to his Highness! But what's going on out there? Let go of me! Let go of me! Who are you? What do you want? I am a poor woman who comes to beg for mercy. Rise. - No, like this. Like this, on the ground. I must reveal a hideous truth. Highness, say that you will hear me. Rise. And now speak. I still have on me the marks of the lashes I got for your escape. And yet, I'd give my life to be able to save you. But from here? there is no way out. Tonight the fleet shall set sail in full battle gear. And unfortunately, without you. Rolando, is there anything I can do for you? Go to my father. And tell him that his son dies innocent. Goodbye, Rolando. Is this the truth you've told me? On my daughter's life, Highness. It is the truth. D'Avila threw himself on the dagger I had grabbed to defend myself! But before this hour, did you never feel any remorse? It is my greatest sin, Your Highness. Who, besides Negroni, is aware of this intrigue? Messer Bartoli. If your Highness compels him to speak, he won't deny it. Very well. Your orders, Highness? Arrest this woman! Your Highness? Arrest me? Then you didn't believe me! I've sworn on my daughter's life, who is dying! I was forced to lie! Compelled by threats! Hurry! Take her away! This is an infamy! Damn you! Is this how you render justice? Keep her silent! I am innocent! I am inno?! Remember the orders I gave you. And now let Bartoli in. I have always esteemed your services, Bartoli. I know you're a faithful servant to the Republic. Please believe me, that has been the greatest ambition of my life. Yes, but it's not enough to affirm it. It is necessary for deeds to match intentions. That woman? She's the reason why I sent for you. Listen to me, Bartoli. In this hour, so decisive for Venice, a great misfortune threatens my house. It has been revealed to me that Rolando Candiano is innocent. And that my wife's husband would be no stranger to the plot against Rolando. Your Highness? I? Bartoli, look at me! I know that Rolando was violent. Perhaps Msgr Negroni obeyed his own political agenda but? that's not what matters to me. I want to know whether the person who reported to me? Imperia? - Yes. There's nothing to fear from her. She won't escape from our hands. But Rolando? Rolando is free! And you understand?? Your Highness may rest assured. Rolando is no longer in a condition to speak. And what did you do with him? He was taken tonight. And your devoted servant has had a great part in this undertaking. This very day, his mouth will be sealed forever. And the secret? will be buried with him. And where have you led Roland? To the dungeon pits, Your Highness. Captain! Quick, fly! Let Rolando Candiano be immediately set free! Your Highness? What has happened? I saw Bartoli? - It's my order. And may I ask why? Bartoli has always been my confidant. And is that why he acted for you? To comply with your crime? Highness! You have brought dishonor to my family. Since you don't know how to live, at least know how to disappear! Avoid the shame of a trial? and a condemnation! Rolando! You are free! - And tonight you can leave! For the glory of Venice! Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you! Go to the cloister at once. My command shall precede you. Then you can embrace your daughter once again. Let Rolando Candiano resume command? and depart with all honors! Long live Rolando! Hurray! Rolando! Even you betrayed me. - Don't say that. I was the victim of a lie, like you. But in my life, in my heart, there is only you. And I will be only yours. Yours or no one else's. Wait for me faithfully. English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
