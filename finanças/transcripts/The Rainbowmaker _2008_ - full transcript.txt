TH E RAINBOWMAKER What are you watching? Does Dad look like him, Granddad? Him? Didn't I tell you what he looks like? Like a giant and a hero. - That's right: a giant and a hero. How would the poor soldiers at the front have managed without your father? Here, look! Here, look: this is Dato, your dad. And now, let's have the best soup in the world. I hate this soup. I hate having it. Me too. I'm sick of it. Hey, kids. Did I tell you about how your dad saved the lives of the generals? Well, a week ago your dad took his plane up on a secret mission. He had some big-name generals on board, namely, General De Gaulle and Field Marshal Montgomery. And then our submarine resurfaced... Ah, those great battles during Garibaldi's times... "Normandy-Neman"! Those boys were real pilots, real heroes! Suddenly, their plane was attacked, and then boom! It caused a panic, but Dato didn't feel panicky at all. He stuck his mighty arm out of the plane to keep the balance and made... a beautiful... forced landing. The generals thanked your dad. And then they took off their own medals and pinned them on your father's chest. Now, here's the question: Why is your dad so strong and powerful? Because he used to eat this very soup when he was a child. Our dad must be huge if his shadow is so big! Yeah, a giant. Pity we only have a photo of his shadow. Grandpa said he has to stay anonymous because he's a secret agent. But when is he going to show up? - Soon, maybe... Yeah, and bring Mum too... Come in! When Dad comes home he'll bring Mum with him and never let her go. It's time to go, isn't it? - No, I can't come now. No, I can't. Not now. I can't just leave the kids to fend for themselves. When do you think your son will be back? In a year maybe. But they've said they'll let him out earlier if he behaves well. He's innocent. He's been slandered, but he has a heart of pure gold. Look, the whole world waits for me so why should I wait for you? I promise I'll follow you as soon as the kids are in safe hands. Just give me a little more time. What about their mum? Do they have a mum? Where is she? Their mum is scum! She moved to the station restaurant a while ago and flits from lover to lover. And the kids snuggle up to her fur coat instead of her. What the hell do you expect her to do? She has to work to feed the kids! Shit, those cigars stink! - What do you know about cigars? Fortunately for you, I've got a soft spot for you... because you're a good man. I'll have to go now. So much to do... And you think things over. Let me walk you to the door. - No need. I'll drop by again soon. Ouch, this damned backache again... Hands off, you old lecher. Take care. Be a good boy. Come on, quick! It could be Dad! Daddy's coming! Whose kids are they? These two are Dato's and that one is our neighbour's. Hello, whose little girl are you? No, he isn't our dad! No way is that maggot our father! Over here... How come you're so late? The circus is in town! Everyone come to the performance! Mummy, I've really missed you! I've missed you too, dear, but I've been so busy. Hey, look at that fire-eater! Do you think our dad can thrash him? - Sure. Good evening! I'm Zurab. It's such a beautiful evening. Your hair's like fire. Such a lovely lady in a dump like this? Are you an angel or a witch? Mummy, are you coming? - Not now, my sweet. You look as big and strong as my son. Come to my place. We can have some wine and a chat. Thanks, but I've already got plans. Are you coming with us, Mummy? Don't be sad, my loves. Children, come here... Tammy... My angel! Hush, go back to sleep. Did you enjoy the food? Not only the food. Time spent with such a beauty is a gift. Is that a compliment? - Yes, it is. People despise compliments here. So, you dream of leaving this place? Every single day. Where do you think you would like to go? To the "beautiful world". What about Paris? Or London? Maybe New York? Hollywood... I promise it to you. That serves me right... She looked so happy. Lfl hadn't seen it with my own eyes... She knows nothing about happiness. She stopped caring about the kids when she moved to the restaurant. I wanted to drag her out of there. - Think she needs you? She wants the good life. What use am I to her? The good life is wherever we happen not to be. You've changed, Dad. Yes. I've grown old. Very old. But while you were away, I took care of your meteorological station. And I kept the lighthouse running, so no one would feel you were gone. The children enjoy helping me. How are they? A stubborn pair, I must say, but they're good kids. And the main thing is they're healthy. The boy's a lot like you. As for the girl, well, you'll see for yourself. I've done my best, Son. I didn't mean to dump them on you. As for my wife, I love her and that's it. It's nearly dawn. I'm not going to bed. You must be tired: take a nap, Son. There's a stranger in the room. Hurry! Who is he? Up already? - Granddad, who's that man in the house? Didn't you recognize him? It's your dad. Stop being silly! You dare to call that weakling our dad? Well, he shrank for a special mission... I don't believe you. I'm not going inside till that maggot turns into a giant. He'll eat well and grow again. Do you agree with me, old man? Come on, let's go! Who is that bloke? Your granddad is a liar. Grownups always lie. I guess your dad is dead. It was you who said he fought in a battle, wasn't it? Yes, he died a hero. And Granddad decided to bring that maggot? Maybe he couldn't find anyone else. Your granddad's old. Yes, he's old: very old. Right, let's get rid of him. My dear angels! Who the hell are you? Me? I'm your dad. Liar! - Our father's dead. He was a war hero. Do you think we don't know what he looked like? He was a giant. -A giant? But, I'm your father. Get the hell out of here! What have you been telling them? They don't even want to see me. They'll get used to you. Give them some time. They never listened to me, but they were all ears as soon as I got their attention with my stories about you. You as a giant and a mighty warrior. They would listen for hours. Why a giant? Why a hero? Why did you tell them such things? I wanted you to be their role model. But Dad, it was you who used to tell me never to tell lies. Ah, the truth! You know what people say about you? They say that your kids' mother is a whore and that their dad is a stupid smuggler who's behind bars. Are you sure you wanted me to tell them the truth? I just wanted to earn some money for my family or whatever you call it. - Wrong! You did it for that damned bitch! Some money, huh? No, it's you who's wrong, Dad. It was my fault. She wasn't happy with me. I failed to take care of her. He failed... He failed... Repeating that gibberish about her being a slut doesn't befit a man of your age. Think before you open your mouth! Stop! - Are you crying? - No, I'm not. Yes, you are. - Say that again and you'll get it! Is your puny dad back? You'll get it too! Your dad isn't a giant, he's a dwarf! Here you are, Zurab. Hurry, we've got to go! Not me. What about our next show? I hate working for peanuts. So you're leaving the circus to us? - Clear off before I change my mind! Wow! Come on, the circus is ours now! Hello! Dato, are you back? - “'Yes“. Good. My oscilloscope is broken. - "I'll fix it for you". So, you were on a secret mission? - "A mission?" Yes, to the North Pole. - "What do you mean?" An expedition... - “No, that wasn't me..“ . But your dad told me... - "Not me, I said..". "Okay, I know it was a secret mission," "so stop kidding me..." - Bye. Hurry! Here, take her... Come on, get a move on! We'll be late otherwise. But Zurab isn't here yet. He isn't coming back, okay? He's staying at the station restaurant. Hurry up, I said! Why are you looking at me like that? What's going on here? - I'm staying. - You're staying? - Me too. - Staying where? Staying here. - Stay here then! Fuck you! I'll make it without you anyway! - Go on then. Zurab must smell money here. You're cheating. - Mind your own business, dear. You shuffle... So what do we have here? What's this? You fucking cheat! Get the hell out of here! What can I get you? Vodka. Coming right up. May I? It's my treat. It's my treat. Where've you come from? - From the sky. Wow! And where are you going? Somewhere I've never been to before. Four thousand four hundred... Peanuts! -Yeah, we'll never get rich from these train passengers. You're lucky: free as a bird... If freedom and loneliness are one and the same thing, you're right. I love music. Where are you going? Shall we kick the shit out of him? - He's up there. The arsehole hung around outside her window all night... Shall we...? -We'll put him off hanging around outside the restaurant. Hey, you! Stand up! Kick his teeth in! Don't you ever dare to go near that place again. Let's go! Woe betide you if I ever see you near the restaurant again! Got that? Can I have some? Who're you? Lia. I'm a pilot. A pilotess! Cheers! The restaurant's closed. I know. My wife works there. Doesn't want to see me although she knows I'm here. She's with another man. Sounds boring. - It is rather banal. Fancy coming up for a spin with me? Problems look small and unimportant from up there. Tiny wife, tiny problems... Sounds good, but I must solve my problems here. Your wife looks unhappy, too. - I wouldn't say so. You're the guy who sends white balloons up into the sky! Yeah, that's my job. I don't feel that lonely while I'm manoeuvring through them. We'd make a good double act, don't you think? - Funny... It's getting cold. Let me walk you home. Where do you live? I've my fire here... - We'll put it out. I was waiting for her, but she's with another man. Just stop whining. Come on, let's go. Help me up. Are you okay? I guess I need somebody to lean on. You've got to get your act together instead of drinking. You were drunk yesterday, too. I heard you singing. If you lose this game you're coming with me. - Stop it, please. The children must get used to their father first and start loving him again. I'll be yours as soon as I've done it. You've lost again. I really pity you, you old fool. The place I'm taking you to is amazing. It's nice and peaceful there. Hey, boy, come here. Listen, can you play cards? - I don't like playing cards. Is she your lover, Granddad? Cut out the nonsense. Of course she isn't! Hey, don't touch the kid. Scram! On the other hand, why not? Maybe I look a bit skinny and pale, but otherwise I'm fairly okay, aren't I? My eyes are deep and beautiful. Why don't you love me, Giorgi? Nobody loves me... Not a single person in the whole world. Not even an old codger like you. God, I'm hungry. What about your favourite meal: chicken in garlic sauce? Chicken? I hate cooking, but I adore late-night snacks. Please! But I don't have any chicken. What about some bread and cheese? - Please! Look, a plane! That'll do! Who wants to fly with me? You? You too? Put this helmet on. Look, can you see our house? - Yes! And there's the sea over there. - Yes. - Are you scared? - No. Hold on, here comes the spin! Your dad's back, isn't he? What do you think about me being your mum? We'll fly every day. Thanks, but you're no more our mother than that sod is our father. You know I despise that woman. She's turned the restaurant into a whorehouse. People are making fun of you. Why can't you see she doesn't love you? Put a stop to this madness. It's not that easy, Dad. I just can't do it. That's the way I am. If you can't live without the woman, go and fight her new lover. Maybe it'll increase her esteem for you. The kids will be proud of you, too. You know she doesn't want me. Wrong! You have to fight for your love. That's the way it's always been. But you have to see that times have changed. I'm not the hero out of one of your fairy-tales. Are you a coward? Are you scared? Are you really scared? Elene! When did you get back? Why didn't you come by straight away? - I wanted to, but... I knowl left you all on your own... Hey, pal, what's the problem? Give us a couple of minutes. - Got a problem? This isn't the right place... lwarned you... - I need to talk to my wife. I've got a new life, a new man. - Give me one more chance! Listen, I told you to fuck off! - Fuck you! Hurry up, Dato's having a fight with Zurab! Dam... Don't touch him! I told you not to touch him. I asked you not to hurt him! I'm going to kill you all! - Sure. Stand up. Don't look at me. He isn't a giant, but I felt sorry for him, having to fight three men. Granddad says you shouldn't hit somebody when they're down. He wasn't scared, did you notice that? Half my life has gone and I still don't know who I am. What have I got? My wife has left me... My children hate me... Hey, you up there! Where are you, then? Can you hear me? Are you listening? Help me or kill me. I can't go on any longer. So, you're here... You were listening after all... Come on, then: do your worst! Who's there? You were flying... - Hello! "Dato?" - Yes. Where's the latest data? I need it now. - "Yes, yes..." Get a move on, it's urgent. - "I'm faxing it right now." WEATHER REPORT: MINUS 28 DEGREES. Where are you going? - I've got to fly. Let me go, what are you playing at? Your dad isn't a hero! He's a crook! A dwarfish crook! Don't roll him down the steps! Get up! Come on! Are you hurt? I'll help you UP- Look, it's snowing. - Hey, it's snowing! Do you remember Granddad telling us about how it once rained frogs? Come inside and have a warm. What's happening to the weather? Have a good warm, old lad. He was some horse in his prime! He used to win all the races. They called him Typhoon. I've never seen him galloping. That's because during the First World War he stepped on a landmine and... Don't talk rubbish, Granddad! Yes? Dato, is it snowing at your eid, too? "What's going on? Are you drunk?" - No. "You wrote "-28" and it started snowing." - "Did I make a mistake?" Did you know it was coming? I wrote "-28". I'll correct it immediately... "Now!" - But what's my mistake got to do with it? "I thought I'd gone crazy!" Why are you sitting in the dark? It was snowing, but now the sun's shining again and the snow's melted. Are you going to belong? You're interfering, dear. What are you doing? - Go and pack. We're leaving soon. Go on. We'll do good business. - Right, I think it smells of money. Yes, alcohol is a good idea. - It'll soon be winter: perfect timing. Playing games with us? - "I don't know." You changed it to +28 "and the sun's back". Maybe I can control nature. - "Sounds good". Don't be angry... I came to say goodbye to the children. I know what you think of me. I just wonder how much is enough for you? A lot. Lots of money and happiness. But the kids don't need much. Just one mother and one father. You're like a butterfly flitting from flower to flower. But butterflies don't live long. That's why I'm in a hurry: I want everything. Mother! Mother! Mummy! Mummy! I'm going on a journey. We're going on a journey! Very well, but as Mr Amundsen used to say, one needs to be well prepared for a journey. Here, take this, you'll definitely need it. Take this globe, because you'll need to know which continent you're on. Take this compass. And you'll definitely need this flashlight in a tunnel. Here's a hat and a hammer to hunt lions with... You can't come with me now, dears. You mother's awful, but your granddad is really extraordinary. Come on. I'll take you with me later. Sorry, dear. Sometimes I might act rude, but once we get to the "beautiful world" you'll forgive me. And the kids, too. They can't wait! It's all my fault! Me and my stupid stories! All these heroes and giants are nonsense! I made it all up! You're no better, either. Fighting with kids who're bigger than you! You little scrappers! We showed them! Now they know this is the fist of the giant's daughter. Stop talking rubbish, Granddad! Got it? - Yes, have you got it? Okay, I've got it. Now start spinning, kids. Who are you? You've come home at long last. Every time I'm here you're either drunk or throwing punches. I came to see your dad. He's gone to the lighthouse. You're going to kill the old man with your problems. I've taken pity on him and am taking him with me, so he'll have some peace. Where are you going to take him? He hasn't told me about it. Wait, are you and my dad... The old sod... But I can see his point. Young and beautiful... You like me, don't you? Your father doesn't , though. He doesn't want to come with me. He'd prefer to stay with you. I can give him peace and tranquillity, but he won't listen to me. Tranquillity with you sounds a bit unconvincing to me. Who are you? Where are you from? Where am I from? Who am I? That's hard to explain: I keep moving all the time. Let me guess. You're on the move all the time? Are you a stewardess, or what? Maybe you're... a streetwalker? I've been called lots of things, but nobody's ever called me that before! You're filled with a strange energy. You've a strong heartbeat, too. It's as if you've got a lightning bolt inside you. Do you know what kind of power that gives you? It makes me want to stay with you. I don't feel well. I'd prefer to be left alone. Sorry. I don't take orders from anyone, dear. Hey, hurry UP, I think he likes Granddad's lover! Maybe she'll take him with her. Come on, quickly. That would be brilliant! Don't be afraid. - Don't stare! - Why not? It's not for kids. - What about you? I'm older than you. - Yes, but I'm a man. Lightening bolts kill some people, but they give others tremendous power. Make good use of it. H ow? You can do a lot with it, but do it quickly. It goes as quickly as it comes. I've noticed that nature is accepting my orders. Hey, what are you doing here? You nosey little brats! - They've been spying on us... Shall I take you and your dad up for a spin? We often go to the merry-go-round. Be off with you! - I'm going to show you a magical world. Gosh, your dad's worn me out. Let me have a bit of a rest and I'll call you later. Now scram! Off to bed. I'll call you. Shall we listen to some nice music? That Death woman calls him our father, too. Yes, but now we know all adults are liars. We'll fly and see. H ow? Grandpa says extreme situations are great for getting to know people better. What's an extreme situation? It's like an excursion, I guess. Watch out! Who's fighting who? - I don't care. It just means more work for me. Look at all the money flying about. Maybe a bank was bombed... Look, the money. Come on, help me. Pick it up. It's flying! This is great! Give us a hand. - What's going on? We're picking up the money. Come on, come on! Put it in here. Yeah, let's put the money in the suitcase! Hurry up! Get a move on! - Just a little bit more. - Brilliant! - We have to go now. Put it in the suitcase! - We're catching it, we're catching it! There's so much of it! Why is enough never enough for you humans? Let's go. Let's go. We'll be late. - Let's go. Now we're going to fly again! We're losing altitude. You must get rid of that suitcase. To hell with those damned dollars. I can't do it. With this I can take Elene wherever she wants. Then I'm going to dump you and take your children with me. - Dad, Dad! - Yes, it's me. I've lost everything! - In your dreams, Son. Was it a dream? Yes. Hey, where did this come from? - Pleased to see me? - Lia! Hello! - I'm Giorgi. - I'm Lia. Where have you been? - Just somewhere. Can you leave us for a second? And you? How are you? I don't know... It's lovely to see you again. Let's talk. Would you like some red soup? - Dad! Please! Yes, I'd love some. He's a lousy cook! - Would you marry me? - What? A pilot-mum for your kids! My apologies, but what about some good red wine? - Yes, please. - Dad! Well, you're a wonderful woman and a really good friend, but... Forget it. When a man doesn't know what to say he usually starts with "You're wonderful, but..." No, I didn't mean that... God, it's him again! You're really terrific... - It's alright. I really do like you... - I know, I know. Right, I'll be off. - Wait, don't go. Are you already leaving us? What about the soup and wine? No. What a pity. Who is she? A pilot. A very good one. - A damned good one. Dam. You? You swam all the way here? Yes. Remember what a good swimmer I was at school? Of course. You always came first. Wait, you're all soggy. It's so beautiful up here. - Howl love you! Haven't been here for a while. - You like it? I'm so glad you're here. I've missed you so much. I came to say goodbye. I needed to see you before I leave. No, darling. I can't let you go. I finally know what life's all about. I know I fucked things up... You've gone off me... You always wanted me to change. You'll never change. Do you want me to give you a rainbow? Here, look! You're like a little kid! Look! What's going on? Rainbows? How? Did you do that? Come back! I'm begging you. No. I'm living with another man. He's going to take me away. No. I'm living with another man. He's going to take me away. Go then! Are you really happy with him? - I just came to tell you I'm leaving. Leaving you, the station, the restaurant. Maybe I'm just being silly, but I want to be happy, too. Witch! I hope you drown. Drown! Elene! I'm coming!
