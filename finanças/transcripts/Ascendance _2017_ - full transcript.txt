- The old tunnels... Much the same as they've always been. Whenever we'd visit my Aunt's house, this is the place we'd explore. But now, I come alone. As a girl, I used to wonder if there was some creature lurking in the dark, some huge monster just around the corner waiting to pounce. Scaring myself was half the fun in those days. Little did I know that it was in these tunnels that events would unfold that would change the course of everything. - Something unexpected is happening on the sun. According to measurements from NASA's Reported Observatories the sun's vast magnetic field-- - Five, four, three, two, one. Houston, negative return. - Copy, negative return. - What would you do if you had dreams of disasters and they started coming true? It all started after the funeral when I was sent to my aunt's house to live. - Aunt? - Yes, come in, Sarah. - My aunt and I had never got on that well. - Just... Just come out when you're ready, eh? - Who is that? - It's nothing. It's just some people up at the tunnels. - Extreme climate conditions caused historic flooding along the Mighty Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. And severe storm events have made this tornado season the deadliest in 50 years. - We have been dealing, this spring, with a highly unusual set of catastrophic weather events. And we have over a thousand core employees-- - It was getting worse. Sometimes I feel like Google is my best friend. It was late, and my aunt said she had to go out for half an hour. - Okay, well I won't be long. - Okay. - Bye. - See ya'. - The National Weather Association in Nashville has issued a tornado warning for Rutherford County in Middle Tennessee. South Central Wilson County in Middle Tennessee. And from 4:15 PM central standard time at 3:34 PM central standard time, National Weather Service Doppler Radar indicated a severe thunderstorm on top of that producing a tornado. This dangerous storm was located 15 miles south of Sevierville, or 16 miles southwest of Jonesborough, and moving northeast at 15 miles per hour. Take cover now. Move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows. If in a mobile home, a vehicle, or outdoors, move the closest substantial shelter, and protect yourself from flying debris. Tornado warning for-- - Well, I'm sure people have dreams of disaster all the time. My favorite photo of my parents was taken when I was eight years old. I told my aunt I was going for a walk around the beach, which was true. No way out. Hello? Who's there? Hello? No... No. Yes! - The mission was to find any survivors after an EF5 tornado ripped through this neighborhood. Their mission not only included searching for survivors, but finding potential hazards as well. - It was the deadliest tornado is the United States since 2011, when 161 people were killed in Joplin, Missouri. Moore, Oklahoma was also hit hard by a deadly tornado. - It had happened again. Smoke! Auntie! Auntie? Auntie? Auntie? Auntie? Auntie? - Back on. - What happened to all the angels? - I just felt like a bit of a change. - Very believable. What was going on in this place? Unearthly beings in the tunnels... And disturbing dreams night after night. Later that day, there was more bad news. - An asteroid about 45 meters in diameter is going to pass very near our planet on Friday; the closest ever predicted approach for an object this size. But there is no need for concern says NASA's Near Object Observations Program in Washington. In 1908, a slightly smaller asteroid exploded over Tunguska, Siberia, leveling trees over 2,000 square kilometers. NASA estimates 100,000 objects this size are in Earth's vicinity. On average... - We've never seen an object this big get so close to Earth. An asteroid about half the size of a football field only 17,200 miles above our planet's surface. There's no danger of a collision, but the space rock has NASA's attention. - Driving with my aunt was always fun. - Auntie, stop the car, please. Stop the car! - Nobody else on this street can see me. It's given to very few. - I just wanted to ask you-- - I have no permission at all to answer any of your questions. I'm sorry. - But I just wanted to ask you something. - When the way is close, knock and the door will be opened. Seek... And you shall find. - So, what was all that about? - I thought I saw someone. - Never do that again. I will seek permission to answer some of your questions. I'll meet you right here, mid-afternoon tomorrow. Expect perhaps some answers. In the meantime, there are creatures at some of these side tunnels you would never want to meet. Stay in the light. Mid-afternoon tomorrow. - Hello? You okay? Hello? You okay? What happened? - There was some whispering, and my torch went out. - Let's get you out of here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Sarah, there's someone here to see you. - You're thinking you'll not go back up there, but I say again... Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door will be opened. - You're older. Hello? - Sarah. - Sarah... You need to prepare yourself for what you're about to hear. Come. - You're an angel then? - You could call me that. - Why do you come to the tunnels? - They call that place Jacob's Ladder. Jump from there to anywhere in Europe or the Pacific. Come. - I keep having dreams of disasters. And they seem to be coming true. - The time of shaking has begun. Everything that can be shaken will be shaken. - He told me we were nearing the end of all things. But beyond that, wouldn't say much. - You have entered the time of birth pangs. This have never happened before. You need to prepare yourself and those close to you. Come. If you meet with me here tomorrow at the same time, there's more that you need to here. - Some 1,600 tornadoes crisscrossed the United States last year. Other parts of the world experienced similar extreme weather. The year before, Russia experienced its hottest summer in 500 years. These conditions are likely to trigger more intense droughts, heavier rainfall, and stronger storms. - I couldn't work out why the angel hadn't told me more. - No, no, no, both of her parents died. Anyway, I better go. Yes, we'll be in touch. Okay... - It was then that we learned the space shuttle was being sent on a special mission, something to do with the sun. - Say go for launch, OTC. - We're a go. - TVC. - The boosters are a go. - TCC. - TCC is go for launch, sir. - LCS. - LCS is go. - Two supply. - Two supply is go. - MILA. - Go for launch. - STM. - STM is go. - Safety counsel. - Ready to go. - SRL. - SRL is go, we're ready and clear for launch. - So, out again? Up the hill again. - Beware the voice of deception. - Sarah. - Thank you. The dreams, they're getting worse. - Your long civilization is coming to an end. Come. You know what happens over the next 60 years, Sarah? Collapse of Western Europe, collapse of Eastern Europe. Collapse of East Asia, with or without disasters. For decades your people have immersed themselves in a marketing culture; an entertainment culture that tells them over and over, "Live for self, exist for self." What's coming is a global population collapse. It's already underway. - Surely there's some way of turning it around. - For sometime we've had it under consideration to pull most of our forces out of the richer countries; focus on the poorer nations. We're getting very close to doing this. - But if you leave, won't the disasters get worse? - They will get worse. It's already happening. We've done all that we can here. It's time to go. Come. - Could we meet again tomorrow? There's something I've been meaning to ask you. - We can. - Atlantis OTC, closure launch advisors initiate O2 flow. - That's a one. - Firing chain is armed. Go for main engine start in t-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five-- All three engines up and burning. Two, one, zero, and lift off! Lift off of Atlantis, the shoulders of the space shuttle. - Deploy it now Houston. - Roger roam, Atlantis. - Atlantis Houston, go at throttle level. - Houston now controlling the flight of Atlantis. - Copy, a go as well. - Multiple ground complete, Atlantis now heads down wings level on the proper alignment for its eight and a half minute ride to orbit. Four and a half million pounds of hardware and humans taking aim on the International Space Station. - Hello? Hello? Hello? - She's gonna get hurt. - It cannot be helped. - And the other? - You know the situation. But it is time. It's time. - Auntie? - Back on. - The solar storm. - Sometimes they erupt like a billion atomic bombs going off at once. - So far, blackouts from solar storms have lasted no more than a day or so. But many scientists worry about a super storm. The last one happened in 1859. - The iconic Harrington event of 1859, a solar storm that set telegraph offices on fire, and sparked northern lights as far south as Hawaii. A similar storm today could have a catastrophic effect. - Something happens to you when your parents die young. One day they were there full of life... The next, they were gone. The police came to the door to tell me. I couldn't even speak for two days. I've never told the angel, but ever since that time I've never prayed one prayer, never set foot in a church. I just couldn't do it anymore. - Sarah... Come. - The thing I've been meaning to ask you is... Do you know my parents dies two months ago? They were killed by a drunk driver. I never could understand why God would do that. Why would he take them away like that? Why would he do that? - Are you saying it was God? That caused that man to go get in his car and go kill your parents? This is not his kingdom. He's not responsible for all that happens down here. When he was, this place was a paradise. People blame God for every terrible thing, even when it's nothing to do with him. Do you understand, Sarah? You live in a fallen world. Come. - Thank you. Tomorrow again? - We can do that. - It's funny, for after our talk I felt a bit lighter. - Atlantis Houston. - Houston Atlantis, model has arrived onboard Atlantis with the arm. - We copy. - Accept, clear. - Along side drill strap, open it went. Copy, drill strap clear. - Stop motion. - Motion stopped. - She's getting quite suspicious. Well, she hardly talks to me. They've been triggered into going out there. Well, you're the counselor. No, I'd rather just wait until she decides she's ready. No, no, let's just leave it. Okay, alright, bye-bye. You're not going out there again, are you? You're not going. - I have to go. - Sarah... There is something important you need to know. Come. I told you how close we were to pulling our main forces out. This decision has been made. This has been my final week. Today is my final day. We're leaving. You will not see us here again. - Can't you stay and fight just a little longer? Please, don't abandon us. - The decision is not mine to make. I'm sorry. Come. - Please, if you leave I feel like something terrible will happen. - We cannot stay. I'm sorry. Goodbye, Sarah. - Houston Atlantis. - For sometime, we've had it under consideration to pull most of our forces out. - Won't the disasters get worse? - This has been my final week. Today is my final day. The decision is not mine to make. - Please, God... Our Father, who art in Heaven... Hallowed be thy name... Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, the glory, forever and ever... Amen. Auntie. - They've gone out there, Sarah. - So, you do know something about them? - Well, I only saw them from a distance. - Then why were you acting so strange? - I was trying to protect you. - Well, they're gone now. - Oh, sorry, but... Sorry the way I've been about it all. I guess I was afraid. - That's alright, I'm sorry for overreacting. - There will be signs in the sun and the moon, and the earth, and distress of nations. The powers of heaven will be shaken. The sea and the waves will ruin, men's hearts failing them for fear. There will be signs in the sun and the moon, and on earth-- - Okay, we just lost the flat prime, gang. I don't know what happened here. We've had everything in the world drop out. - We've had a couple of cardiac arrests down here too, Pete. - I got three fuel fail lights. A fuel cell disconnect, overload, one and two, HC out. - FCE, FCE to auxiliary. Took one Charlie. - One Charlie. - Atlantis, station on the big move, we have you in sight. - Initiating RPMs. - Atlantis, you are a go for dunking. - Go for dunking. - Houston, the station Atlantis caption confirmed and we see three drifts. Station Atlantis Houston, station's three drift is confirmed. - Welcome to the International Space Station. - We copy. - Copy. - Asteroids fly by the earth all the time, but this one is special. - The 45 meter asteroid will speed past us at about eight kilometers per second. About one tenth the distance between the earth and the moon. - That asteroid is going to hit. - Just because in your dream it did, it doesn't make it real. You just need a good night's sleep. You'll wake up in the morning, and everything will be fine. - NASA says the asteroid will be visible in parts of Eastern Europe, North Africa, Asia, and Australia. - Your long civilization is coming to an end. - I'm sure people have dreams of disaster all the time. - Everything that can be shaken will be shaken. - There's really no chance of the asteroid hitting the earth. - You have entered the time of birth pangs. - Just because in your dream it did, it doesn't make it real. - The time of shaking has begun. - You'll wake up in the morning, and everything will be fine. - It's really happening! Auntie! - What was that? - It's the asteroid, I think they're more coming. We've gotta get underground. - Wait, there's a shortcut through here. - You're sure? - Come on! - What is this place? - It's the drum room. - You're back. Auntie? Auntie? - Back on. - No! It was just a dream. - This civilization cannot be saved. I've been sent to bring you and your aunt to safety, along with... Others. - Atlantis Houston? Atlantis Houston, come in? Atlantis Houston? - Some of you are thinking that this too was just a dream... And I'm about to start awake just like all the other times. Others of you think this whole thing has all been in my head. Well, maybe you're right. Or maybe not.
