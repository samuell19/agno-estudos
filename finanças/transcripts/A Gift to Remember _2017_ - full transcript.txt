Good morning, Darcy! Good morning! You were supposed to call me last night. I want to hear all about your date with Oliver! And if there was anything worth reporting, I would've called. The new Anthony Cleaver Parks! Your copy's already at the front register. Merry Christmas to me! I'd swear you just work here for the employee discount. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Darcy! How's that look? It looks great, Josh. Except you misspelled "featuring." Aww man. Good morning, Terrence. My landlady made peppermint fudge last night. Hmm? Peppermint fudge, your favorite. Oh. Thank you, Darcy. You okay? Look what arrived in the mail yesterday. Books, Books, Books has decided to have their own Christmas Eve event. What? They stole our idea! Well, we don't have the market cornered on Christmas Eve events. Yes we do! Our Christmas Eve is a tradition. They can't just sweep in here and... Okay, this is an exact copy of our event! No point in getting angry, because there's nothing we can do about it. We'll just concentrate on having our own wonderful Christmas here, the way we do every year. But don't you think we should... I think we should root for all bookstores to be successful these days. Even the competition. Okay. What kind of a name is Books, Books, Books anyway? That I'll grant you. Now give me some of that peppermint fudge. Your grandson is going to love this, Mr. Farley. It was one of my favorites. I remember his mother loved it when she was his age. I'm so glad you thought of it. See you guys on Christmas Eve? We'd never miss it. Perfect! Just give me a moment and I will get Josh to wrap this up for you. You didn't give him a chance! Who, Mr. Farley? No, Oliver last night. He doesn't read. You sent me on a date with someone who doesn't read. What'd I miss? I sent Darcy out last night with a very nice guy. But she won't see him again because he can't quote Charles Dickens. "I will honor Christmas in my heart, and keep it all the year." See? Josh can quote Dickens. Josh works at a bookstore. I'm willing to hold out for a guy who gets as excited about a new book as I do. Nobody gets as excited about a new book as you do. Does it really take three of my employees to gift wrap a book? Terrence, would you please tell Darcy to be more adventurous? I think Darcy is as adventurous as she wants to be. Thank you. I've got my friends, I've got a job I love, and any time I want adventure, I have a whole store full of options. Here you go, Mr. Farley. Thank you, Darcy. I'll see you at the Christmas party. You bet. Ciao, bella! Check out Santa's helper! In Naples, we call him "Babbo Natale." Well, you do Babbo Natale proud, Luigi. Grazie. What's for dinner? Manicotti, a side of sauteed spinach, and for dessert, apricot crostata. There's no way that's only five dollars. For my favorite customer, always five dollars. Thank you Luigi, you're amazing. But if you keep doing this, you'll go broke. And if I don't do it, you're gonna starve! Thank you! Okay, ciao. Buona sera. Good night. Well dear, how was your day? Busy day. Katherine was quite disappointed to learn that her matchmaking skills aren't all she hoped. Oh let me guess, he wasn't a reader? Exactly! What am I supposed to do with that? Oh! It also looks like our biggest competitor is trying to compete with Christmas Eve at Chaucer's. Well they're foolish to try. Chaucer's is a Philadelphia tradition. I think we might need to step up our game this year. Have a gingerbread man. No thanks. Bite the head off, it'll make you feel better. All right well, I'd best get back to work. I'm stringing lights on my Christmas tree. I thought you did that already? It needed more. Of course it did. Well, I've got the new Anthony Cleaver Parks book, and a tree with just the right amount of lights. I'm gonna curl up with my dinner, maybe a cup of hot cider. And a few more of those cookies. Oh, good night! Good night. How did you learn to make these? Origami Made Easy. I picked it up forever ago, always meant to do something with it. Last night, I finally did. You made all of these last night? What can I say? I'm crafty. I just wanna see you channel that energy into something other than reading and crafts, which is a fabulous lifestyle if you're 70. Katherine! Wait, that's not even true. My grandma is in her 70's and she takes ballroom dancing lessons. I'm not doing that. Well... would you look at this? We're going big! This is beautiful! Thank you, Terrence. Can I borrow you two for a second? When? Well, we're hoping for the end of March. Wendy and I will be doing some house hunting in San Francisco when we're out there next week. But what'll happen to the store? I'm hoping we can find a general manager we trust to keep it open, keep it going. Chaucer's has been around for a long time and we wouldn't want Books, Books, Books to be the only option in the neighborhood. So you're not selling the place? Well, we're open to all possibilities. But the plan is to keep it open under new management. Of course, if any of you would like to apply, I would welcome that conversation. We're really gonna miss you, Terrence. Well it breaks my heart to say goodbye, but the pull of grandchildren is very powerful. I understand. I'm sorry to break this to you all a week before Christmas, but since I'll be seeing candidates for the job, I thought you should know. Thanks for telling us now, Terrence. So no long faces, okay? Let's just try and make this the best Christmas Eve at Chaucer's we've ever had, all right? I can't believe Terrence is doing this. It's like he's breaking up the family. We'll still be a family, Darcy. We'll just have family in San Francisco, too. But I mean around here. We grow the family. You know Terrence will find someone great. Unless he decides to sell. You don't think he will, do you? He can't! Someone'll turn this building into a yoga studio so fast... Not necessarily! Are these little books made of matchboxes? Yeah, and now I've got like three Ziploc baggies full of matches, so let me know if you need any. I'll keep that in mind. Or worse than a yoga studio, it'll be like the third craft microbrewery on the street. Or worse, they'll just tear it down and turn it into luxury condos. Darcy, everything will be fine. This is someone's dream job, I'm sure of it. You! You, Katherine! You're senior manager, it should totally be you! I'm done with grad school in May. I hope to be putting my journalism degree to use. Terrence needs someone that'll stick around, really love place. What about you? What about me? For the job! I don't know anything about running a business. Think of all the thousands of things that could go wrong if... There you go, right back to the worst-case scenario. There's a doggy in the window. I see that. And that doggy has a person! I see that too. Come on, Bailey! Come on, Bailey. Looks like we're early. Hey, what's for dinner? Chicken picatta. Oh, I didn't even think about you having a place for your bicycle. I get such blinders on when it comes to decorating. It's okay, I've got it. But if I come down tomorrow and my bike is covered in tinsel... If it stands still long enough, I decorate it. Speaking of which, I have a beautiful star for your tree. Let's have dinner together and hang it! I'd be delighted! Beautiful! Thank you. I think your friend has a point. But I don't know the first thing about managing a store. You have the most important qualification. You love books. It's true, I do. But I like things the way they are. I know my advice doesn't mean much, I'm only your landlady. You are far more than that and you know it. If you gave yourself a bit more credit, you'd realize that you are tough as nails and twice as sharp. I didn't meet your parents, but I know they'd say the same thing if they could. You think so? Yes! A life embracing possibilities is what every parent wants for their child. Don't get me wrong, I love my life, my friends, I just... I wish I could still... Still go to your parents for advice? Oh sweetie, trust me. You never outgrow that feeling. It's just easier when I keep the big twists confined to my reading. In real life, I wanna know what the day's going to bring. Where's the excitement in that? The day brings what it brings. You take what's given, and eventually you turn it into something wonderful. What do you think, Bailey? Not bad, huh? Hello? You fell asleep in your comfy chair. I fell asleep in my comfy chair! You forgot to set your alarm. I forgot to set my alarm! You are so late. I am so late! Hey, I just got your message. I'm gonna take Bailey out for a quick walk and then we're gonna hit the road. Thanks for everything. Very funny, Mrs. Henley! Come on boy. Let's go mail these. Look out! Excuse me, here's your dog ma'am. Do you know where they're taking him? Einstein Hospital. Hi. Bailey. Nice to meet you. Einstein Hospital, that's only a few... miles. Feel like a walk? Okay. Come on boy! Darcy? Mr. Farley? What're you doing here? I'm here for my grandson. He's having his appendix out. How is he? They say it's a simple procedure, but that doesn't do much for the worry. I decided to come out and get some fresh air. Need someone to keep an eye on your friend there? Would you? That would be so great! This is Bailey. I just met him, it's a long story, but he seems really friendly. Hey Bailey, I'm Bob. Care to keep me company? I think we'll be fine out here. Thank you. Are you his wife? No. Sister? No. Mother? Really? Then I can't give you any information. But I have his dog. As you've said repeatedly. Leave your name and your number. As soon as I can, I will let him know you stopped by. Thank you. But... what do I do with Bailey? What you'd do with any dog. Feed him, keep him happy and clean his paws after you walk him in the snow. Thanks. Could you maybe just tell me his name? I'm sorry hon, I wish I could. I come bearing good news. It turns out you have a dog, and his name is Bailey. Now, if we could just find out what your name is. Darcy! You're home from work early today! You wait here, I'll make you something for lunch. That's okay Luigi, I just would rather get home today. Look at the little cagnolino! Hello, little fella! I'm watching him for the day, for this guy. It's kind of a long story. La bicicletta, what happened? Just a little accident. My nephew, he works at the bicycle shop. On Frankford Avenue. You leave it with me overnight, I have it back to you like brand new. Luigi, you don't have to do that. It's the season for giving, yes? You look like you could use some Christmas cheer too. It's been kind of a trying day. You come back later, I'll have some tiramisu for you and I'm gonna see if I can find a nice little treat for the pup too - Ok? - Thank you. Okay. Thank you, ok. - Come on Bailey! - Ciao. Ciao! Okay, come on. Good boy. It's okay. Quiet! It's okay, buddy. Did you trade your bicycle for a dog? Did you put up more Christmas decorations in here? I will ask the questions. What is a dog doing in my building? It's the icicles, right? The perfect finishing touch. You have such a good eye. Right now my good eye is looking at a hairy dog in my vestibule. I hit his owner with my bike and now he's in the hospital. It was an accident! Well I'm glad you didn't do it on purpose. The nurse wouldn't tell me the guy's name because I'm not family, but then I had Bailey, that's the dog, I know his name, and I didn't know what to do with him, so I brought him home and here we are. I'm sorry, I know you don't like dogs. Such a thing to say! I adore dogs. Oh, well then why don't you allow pets? I had a tenant once who raised ferrets. It was a situation! Bailey... one night. That's all we need. Come on Bailey. Come on boy! Okay Bailey, I'm gonna have food for you in just a few... That's my favorite spot. You have good taste! I went a little crazy at that pet supply store on 3rd. We've got food and treats, and look! It's a squeaky toy that looks like a snow man! Katherine, he's only here for... Oh, it is the doggie from the window! Hi doggie! He's only here for the night and his name is Bailey. Oh, Bailey, I'm so sorry Darcy broke your person. Stop saying that! You don't know anything about mystery man? No, and his phone is missing. So all I have are his dog, his mail and his keys... Okay Bailey. Looks like he was sending Christmas cards. Should we drop them in the mail? Wait a minute. Let me see that. The return address. We have the return address! 11 Denman Court. Bailey... I think we know where you live! Knock again. If he has family, they're probably at the hospital. Then why wouldn't they call me to check on Bailey? I left my number with the nurse. Hmmm, good question. What're you doing? Seeing if we have the right place. Bailey! Here boy! Come on, let's go get Bailey before someone catches us. Bailey? Come on, pal. You'll be back soon. William A. Anderson. He works in public relations. Maybe he has an assistant or something... Well, that doesn't do us much good. I'm sure he has family. I think he has a wife. Nope, nothing but guy's clothes. Maybe a girlfriend then? - He's got really good taste. - In girlfriends? In clothes. This is cashmere. Did you see all those souvenirs in the hall? I think he travels a lot. That sounds exciting. - Exciting? - You won't even get on a train to Manhattan. Yes, well I can still admire a spirit of adventure in others. Looks like he was headed on a trip. Well, that explains the total lack of Christmas decorations. I love how much his lack of knicknacks is bothering you. I like a place with a little more personality. Oh, but he reads Anthony Cleaver Parks. Let Nothing You Dismay is number three on the Times best-seller list. - Lots of people read him. - No, he really reads him, even the early stuff. There's your icebreaker. Sorry I broke into your house, read any good books lately? Katherine! What? "To the best PR man in publishing. Deepest Thanks, Tony." William Anderson isn't just a fan of Anthony Cleaver Parks, he represents him. He calls him Tony. Wow, can you imagine? The man's got a closet full of cashmere, but this is what impresses you. Yes, this is what impresses me. - Hello? - Miss Archer? This is Nurse Nancy from Einstein Hospital. Our patient is awake, and he's asking about his dog. Oh, that's wonderful news! I'll be right there! See you soon. Could you get us a lift downtown? Miss Archer, thank you for coming. Oh, I was so happy to hear from you. Right this way, I'll escort you. I got permission for us to bend the rules a little and let Bailey visit. I'm sorry I couldn't give you more information this morning, but I'm bound by confidentiality and I had to ask his permission first. I completely understand. He took a hit to the head, and he's having some memory problems, which is not unusual. Is Mr. Anderson going to be okay? I thought you didn't know him. I did a little detective work. Well, he'll be happy to hear that you know his name. Why's that? Well, at the moment, he doesn't... So he doesn't know who he is? Retrograde amnesia. It's a loss of autobiographical memory. It's a side effect of swelling on the brain. Once the swelling subsides, memories can gradually return. They can, or they do? It's different for everyone. You're certain of his name? Yes, I found his address on his Christmas cards. I went by his house earlier to see if anyone was home. His name is William Anderson. We believe that if a thread of memory appears, it's best to pick it up and follow it, see where it goes. And Mr. Anderson remembers Bailey, which is already a good sign. Okay. Come on. You have a visitor. Bailey! Hey! Does the name William Anderson mean anything to you? Yeah, actually that sounds very familiar. Is it possible that's your name? I think... Aiden. I keep thinking of the name Aiden. I'm fairly certain that... The middle initial is "A." William A. Anderson. I think people call me Aiden. William Aiden Anderson. That's a good name. Then why is it that my dog's name sounds more familiar to me than my own? Well, it's not unusual. Think about how many times a day you say your pet's name. Details come back in their own way, in their own time. Aiden, this is Darcy Archer. She's been taking care of Bailey. Hi. Hi! I really appreciate you... You look so familiar to me. Do we know each other? Nurse Nancy, could I have a moment? Of course. Darcy. As in Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice? As a matter of fact, yes. It was my mother's favorite book. I'm sorry, this is so surreal. I feel like I know you. Are we friends? Wait, are we related? I should just stop guessing, I'm probably embarrassing myself. I'm the girl who ran into you. Unexpected. I have no idea how to apologize for this. It just happened so fast. And then I was standing there with Bailey and I found your address on your Christmas card, so we went to your house, and then Bailey ran inside, I had the keys... Okay now I'm the one making myself look worse. You went in my house? I did. Was anyone there? No. Did you take a look around? A little. And what'd you find out? Your name. Also, you work in public relations for Anthony Cleaver Parks! He's a very famous author. So, I guess you're kind of a big deal. Well that's exciting. What else? You packed an overnight bag to go somewhere. I think you have a girlfriend. I saw a photo, she's lovely. Also, you're not much for Christmas decorations. No, that can't be true. I'm pretty sure that I love Christmas. Can I help at all? Yes, yes in fact you can. My neurologist said that items from home might be able to jog my memory. Would you mind going back to my house and grabbing a few of my things? I hate to ask, but right now you're kind of... well, you're the only person that I know. I'd be happy to. I'll come by tomorrow after work. What do you do? I work at a bookstore in Northern Liberties. Actually, I've seen you walk by a few times with Bailey. Oh, Bailey. Oh Bailey, I don't think they're gonna let me keep you here... He can hang out with me. That's fine. Really? Thank you. Rudolph! I remember my dog, Jane Austen, and Rudolph. And now you. You need to go out? You wanna come up here, don't you? You had a heck of a day, huh? Me too. Okay, come on. Good boy. Good night, Bailey. I forgot how much I enjoy walking a dog! It's just a great way to clear your mind! My mind is anything but clear right now. I have got to help Aiden remember who he is. I can't find a single Aiden Anderson in Philadelphia. Did you check on Facebook? Yeah, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... I found several William Andersons, but none of the photos were a match. No one's filed a missing persons report for him. And his phone? Missing, along with his wallet and any other ID. The nurse asked me to go by Aiden's place to pick up a few things to jog his memory. Do you need me to watch Bailey while you're at work? Oh it's okay, Terrence said I could bring him in. And on top of all of this, Christmas Eve is in five days and there's still so much to do. Good morning, ladies! Good morning, Luigi! My bike! Just like new, huh? Better than new! How much do I owe you? No charge. Buon Natale! Luigi, I couldn't. You do so much for me already. I cannot take your money. No, no, no. Scoretto! That means impolite. You speak Italian? Un poco. I dabble in the romance languages. I'm a dabbler. Well, I'm gonna walk this home and then Mrs. Henley, if you don't mind... Oh of course! Luigi, excuse us. We are women on a mission. Piacere! Thanks again. Ciao. Well good morning, Mystery Man! Good morning, Nurse Nancy. Well, look at this! You're quite good. I keep seeing this house. I don't know if it means anything. Well, if drawing helps you remember, then go with it. Thank you. He didn't put up a tree anywhere? Not everyone does. Sometimes I do not understand your generation at all. Did you find anything? Yes! A gift certificate for two tickets to The Nutcracker at the Pennsylvania Ballet! Did you find anything helpful? Darcy! This is the most important thing in this house! This is the, the gift of culture! Okay well, you never know. We'll bring it. I'm putting stuff in this overnight bag. Oh! And ho ho ho, what do we have here? He packed it in the bag. Finally, some proof that he doesn't hate Christmas. I was truthfully getting worried. Wonder what's in it? I don't know. I'll take it with me and we'll find out. Well, the box and lid were wrapped separately. That means special care. I know what you're thinking. Stop. Drop that box, lady. I shouldn't drop it. What if it's fragile? Slowly put down that box, Mrs. Henley. If Aiden wants to open the Christmas present, that's his business. Okay, fine. Oops! Mrs. Henley, you did that on purpose! You can't prove that. Well, you've gone this far. I'm already an accessory. I love this new sense of adventure in you. He was going to propose to his girlfriend. Oh this story is getting so interesting. A vegetable? Carrot. A mode of transportation? It's an airplane. Good. An item used in sports? Football, it's a football! This is infuriating. You're doing very well, Aiden. Your MRI shows significant improvement, but I still wanna keep you at least one more night. Now as the edema subsides, your recall will improve. It's usually long term memory at first and then more recent events. Are you spending Christmas with your family, Dr. Holbrook? I am. Everyone wants to spend the holidays with the people they love. I don't even know who those people are. But you'll get there. So how're you feeling? Well, Nurse Nancy here won't let me go outside. You're recovering from a head injury, Aiden. We can't have you wandering around. I'm going stir crazy in here. What if I went with him? We could take Bailey out for a quick walk. There's a Christmas party in the visitor's lounge. Take Bailey out, and report back to me there. Thank you, Nurse Nancy. So, anything look familiar? Yeah actually, this sweatshirt. I think I might've gone to The Ohio State University. Anything else? The award? The book? The tickets to The Nutcracker? No, no... nope. Okay... how about this? No. Nothing. I'm sorry, should I know who she is? Maybe. The thing is... Oh. Do you remember? I think... I think I'll take that walk now. Wow, they really go all out, huh? My landlady would love this place. Here you go. Oh thanks. Thank you! I remembered. The ring, I mean. I figured. That's good, Aiden. It was my mom's. She lost it when I was a kid and she was so distraught over it, and my Dad said, "It's not the ring that matters, it's the promise." Patricia. My mom's name was Patricia. Was? Yeah, she... she passed away. That memory, that's what caught me so off guard. I was in college and I remember my dad calling. I can see his face, I... I just don't remember his name. I'm sorry. We don't need to talk about it. No no, it's okay, it's like you said. I remember and that's good. I'm grateful for any memory, even the sad ones. How long have I had this? I can't believe that I'm holding this right now. And somewhere out there, there's a girl who I loved enough to offer my mom's ring. And I have no memory of her at all. What happens if I never remember her, Darcy? This woman that, apparently I'm planning to marry? I really believe that when you see her in person, and you hear her voice, there'll be a spark, and the memories will start to come back. And if they don't? Well, then you'll make new ones. Maybe we should get back to the hospital. Hello Darcy. Mr. Farley! How's your grandson? That's him over there with my wife. He's doing really well. They say he'll be out by Saturday. That's wonderful news. I'll say. He's never missed a Christmas at Chaucer's. I look forward to seeing him there. How's Bailey's owner? He got to take Bailey for a walk outside today, which cheered him up. All my grandson wants is to do is go out and build a snowman. Gotta be rough on a kid, being stuck in the hospital at Christmas. And then another dot of glue. This was a great idea. Well, if we can't bring the kids to the outdoors, maybe we can bring the outdoors to them. Very nice! Now you try. Okay. And how many of these am I making again? I don't know, Aiden. How happy do you want to make these kids? Okay, good point. I did want something to occupy my time. I just wish I knew a way to repay you, for everything you've done. There is one thing. Do you have any need for those tickets to The Nutcracker? I think I can safely say no. My landlady, Mrs. Henley, has been so great helping with Bailey. Yes, please make that happen. Gotta spread that Christmas cheer as often as we can. Oh, and I tried calling Ohio State's alumnae off Closed for the holidays, of course. It's like every road I try just seems to lead to another dead end. Oh, Darcy. You've been reading mystery novels your entire life. You just need to look for the clues. I'm afraid this trail is stone cold. But I did teach him origami! Yay! Little victories count. Oh, and if you'd like to use those tickets to The Nutcracker, Aiden says you're welcome to them. As a thank you for watching Bailey. Really? Oh Darcy! Oh, that's so wonderful! I told him you'd be excited. No, you don't understand. I was a featured dancer in The Nutcracker, in the New York City Theatre, what? 30 years ago? Oh my goodness. That's the New York City Theatre. They call it something else now, I forget what. And that girl is a professional dancer. How can you tell? Her build, her posture. And that pin she's wearing? That's the Grand Ballet Company in New York. Oh my gosh. We found her! Morning, Katherine! Morning! Aren't you closing tonight? I just came in to drop off some decorations for the display window. And to give updates. Amnesia guy's would-be fiance might be a ballerina in New York. Oh, that's thrilling. She got a name? Not yet, but here's what I'm thinking. He had the engagement ring, he'd packed a overnight bag. Maybe Aiden was on his way to New York to propose to her there. New York at Christmas. Attractive, iconic. I'd say yes to that. But here's what I don't understand. I left a note on the kitchen counter at Aiden's place, with my cell number on it. The ballerina hasn't heard from him in days, but she doesn't come to town to check in? You're right, that's odd. Maybe they got in a fight and the proposal was like his big save, trying to rescue the relationship. Guys do dumb stuff like that all the time! She's right. So, you gonna tell him? I don't know her name, he can't call her. I just worry that it'll cause Aiden more stress. Nurse Nancy says that anxiety can worsen the memory block. You could go to Manhattan. Stop by the ballet, find her. Either of you feel like a trip to New York? I would love to, but I have to study. I'm just not really a great traveler. It would be so nice to not have to do it by myself. Oh! Check out the new ad at Christmas Eve for Books Books Books. They're gonna have a Santa bounce house. How are we supposed to compete with that? Okay, here's what we do. We send out an email blast today to our mailing list. Luigi's Restaurant is going to cater Christmas Eve at Chaucer's. And also put in there we'll have Christmas carolers and a surprise guest, too. That's good, who's the guest? I have no idea. I'll figure it out when I come in this afternoon. Right now it's a surprise to all of us. I gotta go, they're expecting me at the hospital. So early? Well, we're up to something. Okay, bye! Good morning! Well, good morning! I brought you a cranberry egg nog muffin. It's all the flavors of Christmas, in muffin form. Sounds delicious. I ran into Bob and Anita Farley in the hall. Seems like you've gotten pretty popular around here. That makes sense, I do work in public relations. You remembered? No, I'm just going with it. - Fake it till you make it. - Exactly. - Oh, wow. - I know, right? This is the first non-hospital food that I've had in days. Thank you so much. Did you finish all of your Christmas shopping? Everyone gets books. I work in a bookstore. Then again, they all got books before I worked in a bookstore. I believe everyone should declare a favorite author. It says a heck of a lot more than your astrological sign. Fair point. Who's your favorite author? I don't know. But I think I usually do. So did you get your mom Jane Austen? Why would you ask? She named you after Mr. Darcy. I just assumed that Austen was one of her favorites. My parents passed away a couple of years ago. Car accident, so... Darcy, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize... It's okay. It was hard, it still is, but I've assembled quite the surrogate family. And Chaucer's Bookstore is our homestead. I look forward to seeing that. Oh, I wanted to show you. I did some sketches. I think my childhood memories are flooding back, because I keep on getting these really vivid images of school as if it happened last week. Meanwhile, I have no idea what happened last week. Nice! I still don't understand how you did all this. I made a few calls, but most of this was Aiden. Turns out he's very good at bringing people together. He really is a good guy, isn't he? Appears to be. Any luck finding the girl in the photograph? I did find a good lead. I hope you find her. He deserves to have someone around who loves him. Yeah, he really does. Mr. Anderson! Please watch your head. I will! One ticket to Manhattan, please. You don't mind spending the day with Mrs. Henley, do you Bailey? Dr. Holbrook says your scans from this morning look good. So she's given permission to go outside again today for exercise. Oh, that's awesome news! Provided that you have medical supervision. So, it looks like we both get to take a little break today. Anywhere that you'd like to go? Maybe a walk along the waterfront? Actually, there is this bookstore I've been wanting to check out. That's a very interesting story. But I can't give out personal information about our dancers. Right. Except... Maybe could you please? I'm sorry. There's really nothing here I can do. No. No, that's not good enough. I'm sorry but I took the train all the way here from Philadelphia... - I don't see what that... - Listen! There is a man who made a room full of paper snowflakes just to make kids in the hospital smile. And he doesn't know who he is. And this girl? This girl in the photograph, I think maybe she loves him. Please, help me make some Christmas magic here. Let me see. That's Melanie Porter. She's away on tour. You know her? Could I please have her number? Who am I to get in the way of a little Christmas magic? Thank you. Does anything look familiar? Yeah! Actually this looks really familiar. Let's go in. Thank you so much. We got the last four Christmas carolers in Philadelphia. Hey! Take that, Books Books Books! Darcy does it again. That girl can make a plan happen. So why isn't she applying for general manager? It's actually infuriating. Darcy's literally the most capable person I know, and somehow, she can't see it. She's single-handedly planning Christmas Eve, all while taking care of amnesia guy. And his dog. Bailey's a pretty great dog. Can we help you find anything? I'm guessing that Darcy isn't here? What makes you say that? Well you two were just talking about her really loudly. I'm sorry, do I know you? That's a trickier question than you realize. From the front window, of course! You're amnesia guy! Well that is my formal title, but you can call me Aiden. Right, Aiden. Darcy's off today. You said you saw him in the front window before today? Yeah, on Sunday I think. You had Bailey with you. Aiden, maybe you know somebody in the neighborhood. Yeah. You've reached the voicemail of Melanie Porter. Leave a message and I'll call ya back. Hi, Melanie, this is Darcy Archer. We don't know each other. I'm a friend of Aiden Anderson, maybe you know him as William Anderson? There was a small accident, he's okay, but he got hit on the head, and he has a tiny case of amnesia. I called the police again this morning. They still have no calls regarding a missing person. I guess my family doesn't know I'm missing. Does anything else look familiar? Not really. We should get back to the hospital. My car's right over there. Wait a second! Oh, that explains it. You came by on Sunday. I don't work on Sundays. Says Ralph helped you, and you paid cash. Okay well, can I speak to Ralph? He's on a plane to Tucson. Oh. Ma'am, my name is Nancy Thompson, I'm a nurse at Einstein Hospital. This gentleman is a patient of ours. Any information that you could offer would be much appreciated. Let's have a look. Then apparently I found a diamond certificate in some of my mom's old stuff, and even though the setting was an antique, my Dad surprised her with a diamond upgrade in 1989. I'm sure that's significant, I'm just not seeing it. There was a serial number engraved in the side. So I entered the serial number, and lo and behold, it pops up in an antique store right here in Philadelphia. And then you waited three weeks to go down the street and get it? Yeah, that is a little weird. I must've been out of town. Of course, that's wonderful. It still feels like there's something missing there, doesn't it? How so? Well, you're from Ohio. You went to college at Ohio State. You moved to Philadelphia at some point after graduation and then years later, your mother's engagement ring, which has been missing for decades, shows up at a shop located six blocks from your house? I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but you've gotta admit it's a heck of a coincidence. No, it makes no sense. You're right. More missing pieces. Well, maybe one less. Does the name Melanie Porter mean anything to you? No. Melanie Porter. No. Melanie Porter? We can do this all day, if you want. She's the girl in the photo, Aiden. Melanie Porter... She's a professional ballerina. I went to Manhattan this morning and met this really nice receptionist at the Grand Ballet Company. Melanie dances there... I'm sorry, you went to Manhattan this morning? Just a quick little trip on the train. I knew you were nervous about meeting her, I thought if met her first in person, explained the situation... I just wanted to bring you guys back together. Darcy, you amaze me. I wish I had your tenacity. What? That's not how most people would describe me. Well, they should. So did you talk to her? I left a voicemail. A voicemail? So then I guess now we just wait. Are you upset that I didn't ask your permission first? Did I overstep? No, I think we flew right past overstepping on the first day. I really appreciate what you did. I just... I just wish that I remembered her. You will. I also wish that I had your confidence. When you're standing in front of the woman you're meant to be with, I believe you'll know. May I ask you a personal question? Seems only fair. Why haven't you pitched yourself for the position of general manager over at Chaucer's? Uh, what? I may have overstepped a little bit today, too. Nurse Nancy took me by your shop and a couple of your coworkers might have been complaining about you not applying to run the place. I'm going to strangle them! Dr. Holbrook! Hi! Darcy Archer, this is my neurologist. Are you ready to get out of here, Aiden? Seriously? I told Dr. Holbrook that I observed no areas of concern when you were ambulatory today. And the swelling on your brain is sufficiently under control, so I'm comfortable signing your release. But... there's still so much I don't remember. Which is why we'd still like to see you for cognitive therapy, but the best thing you can do is to surround yourself with the familiar. Gosh well, okay. Thanks doc! Stay put and we'll get your paperwork. So what do I do now? I guess you go home. I mean it looks familiar. But it doesn't really feel like home. Give it a minute. Settle in a bit. It just doesn't feel like me. How so? Well, take this sculpture for instance. What about it? I really hate that sculpture. Well maybe it was a gift. No tree? Not even a single decoration? I love Christmas. I know I love Christmas. Would it feel more like home if we decked the halls a bit? Because I can make that happen. I don't want you going out and buying anything. I wasn't planning on it. Just lemme make a phone call. Hey Bailey! Don't worry, there's more in the car! Let me help you with that. Did you pack all that yourself? Oh, goodness no. I recruited Luigi to assist. You must be Aiden. Yes, thank you. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Henley. Darcy, you're right. He is handsome. She said I was handsome? It's... You know, just a descriptive word. Let's unpack some Christmas, shall we? And I'll get the rest out of the car. My friend Josh is covering my shift at the store today and now my phone is dead. It's been a busy day. I feel bad making you miss all this work. I'm the one who usually covers for everyone, I'm just calling in a few favors. I did promise to find a surprise special guest for our Christmas Eve event. I'm still working on that one. Hey, why don't we call one of my clients? Do you remember the password for your computer? You know, amnesia really is the unexpected wrench in the works of a paperless office. I don't like that word. Paperless. It's not a world I wanna live in. So you never answered my question. Why haven't you applied to run the store? Honestly? I'm running out of reasons. I guess I hesitate because I'm not the type of person who looks around a room and thinks, "Clearly I'm meant to be the person in charge here." Okay, but you are the type of person who decides that something needs to happen and then makes sure that it does. Isn't that all leadership is? Maybe so. Besides, there's an experience that I want you to have. What's that? To know how good it feels to have Darcy Archer fighting for you. Thank you, Aiden. That's a great sweater, by the way. Oh, thank you. I can't take credit for it. I did find a business card for a personal shopper upstairs. Someone buys your clothes for you? Apparently. So what do think? How're we looking? Good, I think. One, two... Well, you think we got enough? Yes, it looks great! And who wants to make a gingerbread house? One of my favorite Christmas traditions. Maybe I'll... watch this! Christmas at my house, there was always an assembly line in the kitchen. My mom, she would make so much bread that she would have to bake the loaves in coffee cans. She was pretty famous for it, actually. We would show up to school with a loaf all wrapped up for each teacher. Not just mine, all of them. And they... The teachers... What? I was a teacher, Darcy. When? I don't know. But that classroom that I was drawing, I wasn't a student in it. That was my classroom. I can see it now, I can see my desk, I can see my entire class. I was an art teacher. Third through fifth grade. And my first year of teaching, my mom showed up at Christmas with a loaf just for me. I love that. Why would I give that up? Maybe there's a gift in all this. As you remember who you were, you get to decide who you want to be. I know this song. Well yes, it's been playing everywhere. No, but this version of it. I've heard it before! I know I have. Winter formal, in college. Will you dance with me? Oh, no... Yup, there it is. It's all coming back. And the theme was... bells. Something with bells. Jingle Bell Ball, that's it yeah! That sounds magical. I couldn't have gotten through this without you, Darcy. Well, you wouldn't have gotten into this without me. You have to stop blaming yourself. It was a moment, an accident, and everything since then has revealed to me who you really are. Thoughtful, determined, funny... I do like the way you see me. I love that I get to see you. Aiden will you call your dog, please? Bailey, come! What is going on? I thought you went back to Akron, and then I get this crazy message from Melanie, someone told her I have amnesia? And I've been trying to call you all morning and... what have you done to this house? I'm sorry, could we back up for a second? What are you doing in Aiden's house? This is my house. Who are you? I'm Darcy Archer, I'm a friend of Aiden's. Who are you? I'm William Anderson. I am also a friend of Aiden's. You're William A. Anderson? Yes. Oh dear. You weren't planning to use those Nutcracker tickets, were you? Is somebody baking in here? I don't understand. If you're William Anderson, then... I'm Aiden Harris. From Akron, Ohio. You called and said you'd found your mother's ring at an antique store up here, you were driving up to get it. Wanted to know if I could recommend any hotels that allow dogs. I was in California on a book tour with a client, so I offered you my house. Which you've apparently, decorated for Christmas. - You're welcome. - I'm a minimalist. Yeah, but you don't have to be. And you guys have been friends since college, which is why Aiden was in your graduation photo. Yes. So Melanie is your girlfriend? Yes! She tried to call after she got Darcy's message. I really should've charged my phone. Okay, so I came here from Ohio to get my mom's ring. You had to wait until you were on Christmas break from school. So I'm still a teacher? Yes! Oh, that's nice. I bet you you're a great teacher. All right so... I'm sorry, Will. It's just the last week I've been thinking that I was you. Which explains why you're wearing my clothes. It's a really nice sweater. Aiden, I am so sorry that you've been dealing with this. This is kind of insane, I had no idea. I wish I'd gotten home sooner, I was in LA with Tony Parks. Which is so amazing. She's a pretty big fan. She works over at Chaucer's Bookstore. No kidding! That's a great store. There's not many like it anymore. Keep up the good fight. We certainly try. Aiden, you should probably call your Dad. I don't know when you were planning on being home, but he might've been expecting you by now. The big problem is I lost my phone, and I don't have his number. His generation still has landlines. That's true, we do. I'll see if he's listed. Mrs. Henley? Why don't we pack up and get out of the way? No, what're you talking about? Stay! We're finally solving this mystery, don't you want to see how it ends? I'm seeing it. You're being reunited with people who love you. I'm... I'm just going to get a little fresh air. - Do I follow? - You absolutely follow. Right. When did she have time to decorate out here? She's a very determined lady. What's wrong? Nothing, I promise. But Dr. Holbrook said you'll do better if you're surrounded by the familiar. I need to give you room to do that. But I'm not asking you to. You're only just remembering your life in Ohio. And you wrapped up that ring for someone, and whoever it is clearly means a lot to you. So... go back to your life. And find out who you are. No matter what, I'm your friend, and I always will be. Okay. Thank you. For everything. Aiden! Will has your dad on the line! Are you alright, dear? You look so sad. I should be alright, right? I wanted to help him find out who he is, and we did that. And I made a new friend. But you see him as more than a friend. I don't ask for much, you know? The less you ask for, the less you have to lose. So I found my adventure in books, you know? But this week, it was like I forgot to do that, and I realized that I'm a little braver than I thought. You didn't think about all the things you're normally tentative about, because you were concerned for Aiden. Caring for others reveals the best version of ourselves. Those were special circumstances. I was helping him figure out who he is. I know. And imagine what would happen if you did the same for yourself. Oh, hey. Mrs. Henley left her phone number in the kitchen. She said that she would be more than happy to come by and pick up all of these decorations whenever you want. You know I hate to admit it, but they're actually starting to grow on me. You all set? Yeah. You really don't mind driving me all the way back to Ohio? You have no license, no money, and until last night, you didn't know your name. So I'm not really comfortable letting you drive a car. I can't believe your luck, having somebody like Darcy to help you out. She actually went to New York to find Melanie? Yeah, she did. Wow, that's amazing. Would you go through all that trouble to help a stranger? I don't know, would I? Yeah, yeah you would. But normal people wouldn't. I don't know how you pay that back. Actually, there might be a way. Thank you! Good morning, Darcy. Can't talk. I've been psyching myself up the whole ride over and I don't wanna lose my nerve. Did something happen? Many things have happened, I will tell you later. But right now, I am a woman on a mission. Darcy! Yeah? Good morning, Terrence. Good morning, Darcy. My, don't you look nice today? Thank you, Terrence. I do look nice today. And in addition to looking nice, I submit to you that I look professional and capable. And I would agree with that assessment. Terrence. I believe that you deserve the right to have someone running Chaucer's who really loves it. I concur. And I think I'm that person, Terrence. No, I just don't think it, I know it. And there's areas where I'd need training of course, but I've come to appreciate that I'm the kind of person who sees a problem and doesn't stop until a solution is found. Do you know what half the inventory is at Books Books Books? Not books. What we do is so special and our community needs us and I truly... Darcy. All I ever wanted was for you to want it. Pardon? Of course you could run this store. I've always known that. I just needed for you to know that. Really? I would be honored to leave Chaucer's in your hands. Really. The job is yours. Oh my gosh, Terrence! You will not regret this. So. Let's get you started. Right now? Sunday is Christmas Eve. We have a lot of work to do. Sorry to interrupt. I've got a call on hold for you. Katherine. I would like to introduce you to our new general manager. Oh, Darcy! I knew when you came in with good shoes something was brewing. So maybe this call should go to you then? Who is it? It's Anthony Cleaver Parks. He's offering to do an author appearance on Christmas Eve. Anthony Cleaver Parks? Here? Why? He says he's helping a friend repay a favor. I'll take the call in here, thanks. Okay. Bye boss! I'm just worried I won't remember. Don't worry, you will. Sara! I remember. I remember! Wait wait! I wanted to get a photo of you two! I know that we're overdressed. People don't dress up to go to the ballet anymore. Oscar Wilde said one can never be overdressed or overeducated. Do you hear that, Luigi? We have Oscar's approval. I don't know him, but he sounds like a very wise man, huh? Okay, smile. Have fun, you two. Ciao. Good night. Okay everyone, it's looking good! Let's keep up the pace! The doors open in ten minutes and we have customers waiting! Darcy? Can you come take a look at this for a minute? Oh, of course! Katherine, while you have your phone out, do you mind calling William Anderson and getting an ETA on Mr. Parks' arrival? Oh, Luigi! This looks incredible! I could not have done it without the help of my lovely assistant. Beauty inspires beauty. Great job with the store, Darcy. The place looks extraordinary! Thank you, Terrence. Our special guests have arrived. Darcy! I'd like you to meet Anthony Cleaver Parks. Tony, this is the amazing Darcy Archer. It's nice to finally meet you in person. Me? Thank you so much for all of the online promotion you did. We've been getting calls all day. I'm glad to get your store as much attention as I can. We really appreciate it. Josh, do you think you could show the reading area to Mr. Parks? Please, my friends call me Tony. Okay. This way, Mr. Parks. Or should I say Tony? Well, you're done for the year. Nobody's gonna top that Christmas present. Honey, what's wrong? Nothing. I just... I can't but wish that I could tell Aiden about all of this. And you can. He's still your friend. I know, I just... I spent so much time telling myself that Aiden was all wrong for me. That he lived some fantasy life with the travel and the fancy clothes and that house that looked like a hotel. But, in the end, I didn't realize I was looking for anyone until he turned out to be everything I was looking for. And now I know what I'm missing. Even if the time you had together is all you get, look how much it's done for you! Also, I really want a dog now. That we can do. Look around you, Darcy! At your store! You did this! You just have to believe that anything is possible. Hey everybody, Merry Christmas! Laura lived in a little house with her pa, her ma, and her big sister Mary, her little sister Carrie, and their good old bulldog, Jack. See? Are there any questions? Yes, ma'am? Mr. Parks... What made you decide to set a story at Christmas? There's just something about the holidays, isn't there? The air is heavy with possibility. It's the time of year where we really believe that our dreams can come true. And it's those expectations that enhance the story... Bailey? I think he's just here for the food. What are you doing here? Well, I was looking for something to do tonight, so I went over to Books Books Books, but man, it is dead over there. I meant why aren't you in Ohio? You see those people? Well that handsome older gentleman happens my dad. His name is Stanley, by the way. He wanted to thank you for taking such good care of me. And that sweet little girl? That's my niece, Sara. And that lovely lady wearing that beautiful diamond ring that we thought was lost forever? That's Jenny. My sister. Your sister? The ring was a gift. For my sister. I'd like to thank the staff of Chaucer's Bookstore, particularly the general manager, Darcy Archer, for welcoming me here. It's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you again, Anthony Cleaver Parks! And thank you to you, all of you, for making this the best Christmas Eve at Chaucer's ever! Darcy? Hi, I'm Aiden's sister, Jenny. And this is my daughter, Sara. Hi Sara! Hi! It is wonderful to meet both of you. I don't know what would've happened. If you hadn't taken care of Bailey, if you hadn't helped Aiden... We probably wouldn't have even known he was missing until Christmas Day. Thank you so much. Your brother is a very special guy. Yeah he is. I can't believe he went through all that, and he found Mom's ring. It feels like a Christmas miracle. Do you know where he might be? I think he took Bailey outside. Thank you. My favorite authors are William Faulkner and Patricia Highsmith. Strangers on a Train is one of my favorites. See? Like I said, now I know you a little better. Now I know me a little better, too. I've been trying to separate the things we thought we knew from the things that turned out to be true. Let me see if I can help. Hi. I'm Aiden Harris. And this is my dog, Bailey. Well it is nice to meet you both. I'm Darcy Archer. So what do you do for a living, Aiden? I'm an art teacher. How about you? I run the best bookstore in the whole world. What? This is your place? You run this? For how long? A whole 24 hours. So, do you live around here? Currently I'm in Ohio, but I'm considering a move. Really? Really. And why is that? A wise, beautiful friend of mine once told me that when I found myself standing in front of the woman that I was meant to be with, I'd know. And? She was right. Well, it was a pleasure to meet you, Aiden. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Darcy.
