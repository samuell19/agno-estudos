Now, with Mojo behind bars, our little crime-fighters finally get to take a break, relax, and take her easy for a while. [screaming] Gosh-darn it! Girls, what is it? Too much salsa on the eggs? Bad dad! Bad dad! Bad dad! No, Professor. It's not that, it's this! "Key to the World Arrives in Townsville Today!" Oh, how nice. It's not nice! It's terrible! Keep reading! "Keys. They open our cars, our homes, our hearts. But one k-" No, no, no, read... this! "The Key to the World travels the globe, spending one day in each city. It may seem just like an empty symbol of goodwill and brotherhood, but in actuality, the law clearly states that whoever possesses the Key to the World... ...actually does rule the world?" Well, that's just dumb. I know! We always knew about the Key, but we never thought anyone would be dumb enough to send it here! I mean, Townsville is practically Villain City, USA! Girls, girls, girls, don't worry. I'm sure the Mayor's taken the proper measures to make sure the Key is safe. - Ah, you're right, Professor. - It's all cool. We were all- "Aah! The Key! The Key!" So dumb. - Yes, mayor? - I lost it! I lost the Key! [screaming] All of the villains and all of the bratty ones and all the fuzzy ones and all the icky ones and all the sticky ones and all the scary ones and all the villains are- One of us is not here! Go, monkey, go! Mojo Jojo! Go, girls! Go! Fuzzy went a-shootin' to find the Key, gonna make the world his proper... ty? I want that Key and I want it now! So do what my daddy pays you to do and tear it all down! Mojo went a-shootin'- - to find the Key! Look at all these keys! No...no... no... no... no... no... no... no! Whoops, sorry. A little help, please? Key, Key, Key... is that the Key?... is that the Key? Excuse me... pardon me... coming through! Any... of you... seen... a key? What!? Oopsie. Whatever! I'm on it! Oh, great! Nice! Awesome! Real nice! Everyone okay? Great! See, girls? At least someone isn't messing up around here! Key to the World, Ma! Key to the World! - Uh- - Yeah, yeah! Ooh, it pays to have a magnetic personality. Yes, yes, yes! Finally the Key to the World is mi- Girls! Girls! I found it! My precious porcelain poodle! I thought I lost this puppy. Don't ask. Oh, he's picked up another scent! Good boy! But... Key. Find the Key, not... my bonus checks. Key. Okay, wait for me... No, no, do not pee on that! [scream] Okay... okay, okay. I can figure this out. I'm smart. Come on, think! Think! - Girls! Girls, what do we know? - This stinks! - Right. What else? - We stink! Exactly! This situation is hopeless, and we totally can't handle it. So if we can't beat 'em, then we gotta... join 'em! We gotta find that Key. And so, in a fast time-saving action sequence, the girls use their superspeed to scour every nook and cranny of Townsville trying to find that key! But, once they reach the outskirts of Townsville forest, all hope seems lost. As well as the Key. We... looked... everywhere! Every... last... logical place... it would make... sense... ...to lose a key! Girls! Sense? Sense? Sense? Why are we talking about sense? This is the Mayor we're talking about! Uh-huh. He doesn't make any sense! Uh-huh. He's a dope. Uh-huh. He's a dope we especially know! Uh-huh. What's the dopiest place the big dope would lose the dopey key? - Right in his desk drawer! - Right under his nose! That makes no sense! Makes sense to me! Now if you'll excuse me, I have a world to take over! How did we not notice a tank following us!? Who cares? We can stop him! Come on, gi- How did we not- Come on, gi- Ahem. - How did we- - Call if father's intuition, but the important thing right now is that you beat those villains from getting to the Key first! I made it! Wow professor, that's a really... pretty dune buggy. - But if it's all the same to you... - We're just gonna, y'know... like, fly. Oh, okay, I guess... Just that I made it special for you and all... But if you wanna fly, that's fine. Woo-hoo! What the- Curses! If you don't behave, I'm gonna turn this car around. Ooh, ooh! Push that button, push that button! What? Why? 'Cause it's awesome! Cuuuuurses! Curses, curses, curses, curses, curses! Thank you for activating the self-destruct system. Total annihilation in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6... - Great. Just grea- - 7, 6, 5... 4, 3, 2, 1... Woohoo! Go girls, go! We're in the lead! We're gonna w- Oh, alri- Ahem. Cu- No. You know what? That's it. I'm done. I quit. I give up. I tried, I really tried. For years, and years, I've been trying to take over the world. But I guess the universe doesn't want me to have it. So I'm out. I'm gone. Forget it. The only sad thing is the world would have ruled if I was in charge. But now? Ha! But you know what? You'll never know. You'll never know. And so, my sweets, I, Jojo, am Mojo no more. And so, I go-go. Woo! Key to the world! Key to the world! - We got it! We got it! - Woop woop! Yeah! Phew. What a crazy day. Well, at least the key is safe in our hands. Yeah. If any of our villains got ahold of this, they would be in charge. Yeah, like this! I, Buttercup, rule the world! Everyone has to do what I say! Now drop and give me twenty! Sir, yes, sir! One, two, three! - Wait a minute! - Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine! Bubbles, stop. Sir, yes, sir! What? She's in charge now. Exactly. Girls, listen. We spend all our time fighting to make the world a better place. But with this key, we don't need to fight anymore. 'Cause with it, we actually do rule the world! Woah. My first order of business will be to... Fashion the perfect society based on the social structure of the mighty African Elephant. Where the wisest and most experienced female leads an impartial and fair democracy of her fellow sisters. And all those dumb smelly boys have to do all the cooking and cleaning. No. It's much easier than that. There's only one way to rule the world. Just tell everybody exactly what to do and when to do it. And if any of them got a problem with it, they can take it up with Punchy McGee and Fisty O'Flannigan! You guys are so totally dumb. That's not how you get world peace. You know how you get world peace? Free puppies for everyone!! No! Just let me handle it. I mean, I already am the leader. Ugh, you talk too much. It's time for action. Hellooo? Happiness is a warm puppy! [arguing] - I'll take that Key to the world! - No, it's mine! ♪ Welcome to your life ♪ ♪ There's no turning back ♪ ♪ Even while we sleep We will find you ♪ ♪ Acting on your best of behavior Turn your back on mother nature ♪ ♪ Everybody wants to rule the world ♪ ♪ It's my own design It's my own remorse ♪ ♪ Help me to decide Help me make the ♪ ♪ Most of freedom and of pleasure ♪ ♪ Nothing ever lasts forever ♪ ♪ Everybody wants to rule the world ♪ [growling] [arguing] [arguing] Professor, tell them I should rule the world! It's mine! Mine! Mineee! Professor, tell them to give it! I'm the leader, I'm the only one qualified to rule the world! Who's the strongest, who's the toughtest, who's the coolest? Who should rule? Me! Me! Me! Puppies, puppies, puppies, puppies! All I've got to say is puppies! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I have nothing to say. Mayor? - What... What can we say? - We have no idea what got into us! Free puppies is not the answer. There's only one thing that can right this wrong. We are so sorry. Oh, girls, that's okay. The important thing is that today you learned a very valuable lesson. WITH GREAT POWER comes great responsibility. - Can I see that? - Oh yeah, sure. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Finally, I, Mojo Jojo, rule the world!! For years I have dreamed of changing things to the way I want them to be. My ideas, both right and wrong, shall be law. I will make the decisions, I will control, I will dictate, I am the decider! After today, the world will never be the same again! And now, with the key in my hand, no one can stop me! Mwahahahaha! I've dreamed of this moment. I've sung about this moment. And now it's here! It's really- Okay, now it's here! We're good to go! And with one push of a button, I, Mojo Jojo, with the aid of my global Jojo machine, will unleash a power that will change the world forever! First, I will... End world hunger. Stop global warming. Save the whales. Cure all disease. End all war. And finally, free puppies for everyone!! Uh... Wow! Just... wow! What can I say other than... So, for the first and I guess ultimate time, the day, heck, all the days, are saved thanks to Mojo Jojo! Man, who would've guessed it. Mojo, a good guy after all. Had me fooled. But bravo, Mr. Jojo, bravo. I really love my puppy. Seriously, thank you. The city of Townsville! Ah, what a nice, calm, beautiful, and peaceful day. For reals this time! Oh, no, the pleasure is all mine. It's the least I could do, Mr. President. Okay, well, thank you. Tell the people to enjoy the free electricity for life! Okay, bye bye. Girls, girls! It's great to see you! How've you been? Hope those talking unicorns I made for you aren't giving you any trouble. No, they're fine. Heck, everything's fine. All the time. That's why we wanted to talk to you. We're really sorry. We didn't know we- - All that stuff you used to do. - It all seemed so, so... Bad. Yes, yes, yes. Some of my methods might have seemed unorthodox. Crazy, even. But my heart was at the right place. I had a dream, a passion to make the world a better place. I just needed an opportunity to do it. And I would've done it sooner if you little scamps didn't always stop me. Why I oughta- I kid, I kid. You just misunderstood, it's fine. - All water under the bridge. - Thank you, Mojo. - Seriously. - Thank you. - No, thank youuu! - [laughter] Peace out, Mojo! Ah, yes. Peace. Wonderful peace. Incredible peace. Nice peace. Quiet peace. Boring peace. It's driving me crazy!! Mwahahahahaha! Take that! And that! [evil laughter] What are you waiting for? Get him! Pulverize him! Knock his block off! Give him what for! Make a mess out of Punchy McGee and Fisty O'Flannigan! Not so fast, Mojo Jojo! The city of Townsville, on a crazy, tense and dangerous day! But a day that will be saved thanks to... The Powerpuff Girls! Woohoo! Go, girls, go!
