(dramatic music) (Terry's mom sobbing) (Terry's dad grunts) (dog barking) (dramatic music) (gun blasts) (Terry's dad screams) - [Judge] Terrence Griff, it is the decision of the Juvenile Court that you shall remain a ward of the state. - [Social Worker] Do you understand, Terry? They're going to find you a place to live. (inmates shouting) - [Judge] For attempted escape from the state juvenile facility, you shall remain in custody until you've reached legal age. (inmates shouting) - [Officer] You fucked up. They're gonna lock you up and forget you ever existed. - [Judge] For the assault of a corrections officer during another escape attempt, a term of 12 years. (cell doors clank) - [Inmate] All right, you mother fuckers, actions down, man. Let's go. (inmates shouting) (Terry grunting) (inmates shouting) (inmate grunts) (inmates cheer) - Gimme my money, man! - 300, my man, here you go. - I told you. Control. Fuckin' wuss. (Frankie laughs) - Rudy wants to know when you're gonna be ready to go again. - Hey, look at the mans arm. - He's got two of them. - Tell him I'm retired, man. - Rudy won't like that. - Tell him I'll burn again when he does. - He ain't no fuckin' fool. - Hey, shut your fucking mouth and get your punk ass outta here before I'm kicking it all over this joint. - You best watch your own shit, old man, 'cause if you ain't got Rudy's money by afternoon yard, the only thing you're gonna be kicking is your fucking habit. - Lucky ass mother fucker. (inmate laughs) - Settle down, man, he's just talking shit. - Let me take a look at your arm. - It's all right man. What's he talking about? You owe Baralli money? - Like you said, he's talking shit. - Hey, what's wrong with you, man? - Nothing. - Nah, man, you got in the shit, huh? Dammit, Del, look at me. (inmates chattering) - [Inmate] Take care, man. - [Terry] How'd you get in Rudy? - A nickel. - What's wrong with you, man? That shit'll give you brain damage. You got a family that's counting on you. Do you wanna pull the detox strapped to a fucking mattress? - What can I do? - You gotta lay off that shit, man. You don't pull yourself together and you're gonna go home. Right? Here, take it. - I, I can't. It ain't right. - It don't have to be right. Just pay him. Tell him you'll make good for the rest. No more. - Thank you, brother. (inmates chattering) (upbeat hip hop music) - Say goodbye to that shit. - One week, babe. - Hey, six days, 15 hours. I can't wait to get back to the honest life. (chuckles) Hey, shooter, how you doing? (inmates chattering) You're short, junkie. - Man, I ain't no damn junkie. - That's good to hear, shooter. But I am a businessman and if there's anything I hate, it's sloppy books. Nobody steals from me. - I'll get the rest of your money. That's a promise, man. But I'm through with that shit. - You got till tomorrow yard. You look a little shaky. I can help you get well. I got some pure Mexican brown right here. - I said I'm through with it. - Oh, good for you. (fist thuds) I admire a man who has control and I'm gonna do my part to help you keep straight, shooter. I'm cutting you off. Are you still here? Will you get the fuck outta my eyes? Walk! (inmates chattering) (grinder squeals) - Yo, Del, man, how you feeling? You all right? - Griff! - Yeah. Come on, man. You gotta tough it out, Del. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - [Foreman] Hey Griff, what's wrong with Reston? - Nothing, he's all right. - Well get cleaned up. You've got an appointment. - You gonna make it, man? - Yeah. - Go on now, I'll be okay. - [Terry] All right, hang in there, Del. (metal clanking) - Griff, have a seat. The governor's office has requested a list of applicants for an early release program. - Yeah, so what's the point? - The point is I'm recommending you. - (scoffs) You're telling me I'm getting out just like that? - Yes. You can start a normal life out there as soon as the board approves and the processing is complete. - Yeah? And how long will that take? - About two weeks. Look, Griff, you've done clean time here. I'm giving you a second chance because I believe you've earned it. A lot of bad circumstances brought you in here. Now it's up to you to turn it around. You have a history of assault with intent. If you come back for anything, you'll never leave. - Can I ask you one more question, Mr. Cooper? - [Cooper] Yes. - You got a Reston on the list? - A Reston. Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. Delmar Jr. - Thanks, man. - I wish you good luck. - Thanks a lot, Mr. Cooper. Del, where are you? - [Del] In here. Over here. - Come on man, you gotta get up. You gotta make count. They're gonna be looking for you. - I can't. I can't. - Hey, hey, Del, Del. Yes, yes, you can. You can, you gonna make it, Del. - Find, find Rudy. Find Rudy. - Del, I can't do that. - Just do it! Please. Or I ain't gonna make it. (grunting) - All right, Del. All right. Del, Del. Just stay here. (Del whimpering) Be quiet. (Del whimpering) - Yeah, but I'm gonna be out. - You outside, me inside. Big deal. - Hey, look who's here. The man who feels no pain. What, are you coming outta retirement? - I need some shit, man. - Oh, something to help your arm, huh? - Yeah. - You never come to me before? Are you losing your balls? - Let's just say I got a yearning and I'm asking you to help me out. (Rudy exhales sharply) - Sorry, man, fresh out. - I know your brother's sent in a mule last week. - What, are you all of a sudden on the main line around here? - I got ears. - Yeah, you got a big fucking mouth too. - No, Frankie, no, no, no, no. Got too many guns around now. Talk to me after evening plate. - It can't wait. - Hey, you heard the man. Fuck off! - I ain't talking to you, scum. (Frank grunts) (gate rattles) (Rudy grunts) - No, Frankie, don't. (inmates chattering) (fence rattles) No! Follow him. You saw this? - [Inmate] Followed him to the shop. - [Rudy] You sure it was Reston? - I'm sure. Griff fixed him before lockdown. - They think they're real fucking smart. Griff knows you're walking. So he figures he can play you off and get free shit for his boy until you're gone. I got something for his ass. - Put it away, Frankie. I don't want anybody getting strong, you understand? - No way, man, he crossed the line. I say he gets taken out. - I say no. Griff is a fucking zombie. You kill him, you're doing him a favor. I'm gonna put some weight on him. Make him carry it around until the breaks his fucking back. - Two weeks. Two weeks. Damn, man, that is great! Hey. Hey, what's wrong with you? - I dunno, man. - You don't know? Griff, we are getting out of this mother fucker. Back on the air, Jack. You and me, we are going to the world. Don't you understand? We are getting out. - Don't you fucking understand, man? I'm state raised. Besides from my mother's funeral I ain't seen this street in 13 years, man. - Sit down. You're just scared and that ain't no shame. You're a young man. You've been down too long. It's time you get this misery behind you and get a new life, brother. - I got nowhere to go, man. - Hey, you've got family. We are going to make it. Okay? (melancholy music) We're going to make it. All right? All right? Say it, mother fucker. - All right. - All right. - All right. (machines rumbling) (Del humming) (drawer rattles) (saw screeching) (Del grunts) (Del screaming) - [Inmate] Who is that, man? - Del. Del, what's wrong, man? (inmate shouts) Somebody, get a guard! Del! Del, are you all right, man? (inmates shouting) (retches) What is that shit, man? Jesus, Del, what are you doing, man? Del. Del. Del. Jesus, Del. Del, wake up, man. Wake up. (inmates shouting) - [Inmate] Need some help. (Terry sobbing) - You got your release, man. It's all right. It's all right. (sobs) (screams) (pensive music) - Torres, 884331. - [Inmate] 641323. (suspenseful music) - [Guard] Next! - [Inmate] Steven, 483. (suspenseful music) (inmates chattering) - [Rudy] Hey, hey, Dominick. - Get outta here. Nice to see you. - Good to see you, Rudy. You looking great. - It's good to see you. - You're looking good. - Hey. (all laughing) - You! - Monroe. - Friend of yours? - Yeah. Come on. Let's get the hell outta here. (pensive music) (siren blaring) (pensive music) - Open two. Hey, Griff. Your PO just called. He left this address for you. Said he'd meet you there at noon. There you go. - What's this? - It's a bus pass. There's a stop right up at the corner. Just give it to the driver. What are you waiting for, a limousine? Hey, get going, man. Hey, Griff. Good luck. - Thanks, man. (melancholy music) - [Guard] Close two. (gate rattles) (melancholy music) Open one. Close one. (gate rattles) (melancholy music) (pedestrians chattering) (melancholy music) (footsteps patter) - Who are you man? - Griff, I'm supposed to meet- - Hey, Raymond. You're Griff? - Yeah, I'm supposed to meet Mr. Price. He's my parole officer. - Stand here. Can you write? Sign here. There's your room. Second door on the right. - Thanks. (melancholy music) (water splashing) (melancholy music) - Terrence? - Terry. - Whatever. I'm Jack Price. Don't mind me, go ahead and get dressed. Sorry I'm late. You didn't answer your door so I let myself in. Get yourself cleaned up, huh? Good. Listen, I'm not gonna go into a big song and dance. I'm up to my ass in cases, so I don't have time to hand hold. You take the weekend, get yourself squared away, and Monday we'll see about finding you a job. Understand? - You're the boss man. - No, do you understand? - Yeah. - Good. There's a hundred from the state. The clerk downstairs will give you directions, bus schedules and things like that. There's a card in the envelope with my number on it in case you have any problems. Okay? - Yeah. - If I were you, I'd keep this locked. Got some real losers here. (door slams) (trains whooshes) (pensive guitar music) (singer vocalizing) - Hey, mister. Can you help an old chorus girl? (pensive music) - Here you go. - [Homeless Woman] Oh, you must be an angel. - No, ma'am. (pensive guitar music) (singer vocalizing) (Mrs. Reston chattering) (Terry knocks) (bells jingle) Mrs. Reston? Lorraine Reston? - You another one of Jerry's teachers? - No, ma'am. I'm Terry Griff. I was a friend of Del's. - I remember your name. What do you want? - I have something I think you might want. - My mama gave him this when we got married. - Yeah, I know. - First he says he's coming out early. The next day he's dead. - [Jackie] I'm home. - Hi. - Hey. (Jackie grunts) - This is Terry. He was a friend of Del's. - What are you doing here? - Oh, you bought me Del's medal Mama gave to him. Terry, this is my sister, Jackie. - So you knew my brother-in-law? - Yeah, we were friends. - I didn't see you at the funeral. - They let us out for every convict's funeral we'd be out all the time. - Oh, so you were in prison too, huh? For what? - Does it matter? - Yeah, it matters to me. You're in my house. Look, I appreciate what you did for my sister. Now could you please excuse us? - Thank you, Terry. - I'm sorry, I hope I didn't- - It's okay. It's okay. - Man, what you doing in my house? - Hey, you must be Jerry. I was in front of your father's. - So what? Nothing but a damn junkie. - Hey, man, he was a lot more than that. Maybe for you. (bell jingles) - What you mean you don't need that? Your wrist is bare, you need to watch. You need to know what time it is. All right, man, get on outta here. Wasting my time leaning up on my car like that. Just out here trying to make some money. Say, man. Hey, man, don't overreact, man. Don't overreact. I saw your eyeball on the watches. Just wanna save you some money, that's all. My name's Bobby Styler. Bobby Styler. How you feeling? Yo, man, you fast. You real fast. You a martial artist or something? - Say what? - You know a martial artist? Bruce Lee, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Elvis Presley in his later years. - You got something to show me or what? - Yeah, I definitely got something to show you. You got your Swiss movement, your submariners, your chronographs. - What about this? - This is the latest thing. Perpetual movement, calibrated chronometer, waterproof, shockproof, pressure proof, and wind reluctance. - Yeah. What about one is just tells time? - (laughs) Yeah, Liberace wouldn't even wear this. This here, my own personal piece. Watch like this cost you 450 easy in any store. - How much? - For you? $50. - (scoffs) 45, man. - No way, man. You tripping. Not for that. 40. 35. 30. Damn, man, I got a family to feed. Kids I haven't even made yet. - Two years in the metal industry. Some mechanical aptitude. I think I might have something for you. How'd you like to go to work right away? - That's why I'm here, man. - Mr. Price. - Mr. Price. - You're not in prison anymore, Terrence. - [Terry] Terry. - You're still gonna have to show some respect. - Yes, sir. - Here's the other hundreds you got coming. Well? (typewriters clacking) - Thank you. Thanks, sir. - Well, how about it? Do you wanna get yourself on the floor of things or would you rather stand in line at the employment office? - When do I start? - That's what I like to hear.

(teens chattering) - What's up, fellas? - Man, you back again? What do you want? - What's up, Jerry? Your mother home? - Yeah. Hey, , what's in that bag? - Just a game. - Man, what the hell you bring a game for? Pow, I got it! - Watch out, he's gonna get you. - No, he not. No, he not. I'm telling you. (game blasting) it's jamming, man. Exactly what I wanted. - How did you know? I don't remember writing Del. - Yeah. - I did. - Jackie, look what I got. - Game Boy. - Yeah. - With. - [Both] "Cybernator." (lasers blasting) - You know, the last thing your dad told me was how much he loved you. He wanted to give you a lot more than just a video game. - Doesn't matter. - [Terry] It did to him. He knew what it felt like not having a dad. - I don't feeling nothing. Cool, let me see. - The lion rules the jungle, the eagle, the sky. Together they got no boundaries. - Wow. Did it hurt? - [Terry] Yeah, it hurt a lot. (Jackie sneezes) But I didn't feel nothing either. Bless you. - That wasn't me. - I know. Hey, Jerry, next time I'll tell you a little bit more about your father. - Okay. Jackie. - Oh, Jerry. - What you doing? - I'm studying, which is what you should be doing. (chuckles) - Where's, where's Mr. Griff at? - In the hall. - Hm. Okay. - Can I talk to you? What is it with you? I mean, what do you want? - I just wanted to give the kid something, that's all. I mean, I thought playing a game inside the house was better than hanging out on the street. - Oh, is that right? Jerry doesn't need another person teaching him right from wrong. Jerry's not gonna end up like his father. He really needs to get out of this neighborhood. - I can help. I mean, I might not have much to give, but I thought that if I could help, I want to be here, that's all. - I hope you're telling me the truth. - You know, you're exactly the way Del said you be. - How's that? - Complicated. (Jackie laughs) - Listen, I, I have to get to the hospital. - Can I walk you out? - All right. - Is that right? - Yeah, I like being a nurse. You know, I wanna work for a while and then save some money, you know, and then I wanna go back to school and try for my psych degree. - You mean like a psychiatrist? - No, a psychologist. A psychiatrist is a doctor. - I think you'd make a good doctor. - Why? - I've met enough for them to know. - Well, you have any plans? I mean, have you thought about what you'd like to do? - I got a job. Not much, but it fills up the day, you know? I guess I just wanna live quiet. - Yeah, I can- (toy gun pops) (Terry shouts) Hey, it, it's okay. It's just a toy. I hate those things. - Yeah, me too. - Listen, um, Lorraine is taking the kids to their granny's on Wednesday and, um, I'm having some friends over for dinner. You wanna come? - Yeah. - Okay. Um, eight o'clock. - I'll be there. - [Jackie] Okay. - Hi. Ready to order? - Yeah, I'll have a hamburger. - Okay. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions? - Okay. - Fries or slaw? (upbeat reggae music) - Whatever you got. - See, I've been there. I've been up, I've been down. I didn't know where I was gonna eat. But you know what? He gave me a shot. - And coffee. - He gave me a shot. He told me I could be something. Then two months later, man says, he says, "Styler, if I had 10 more like you, I'd be rich." (laughs) Bobby Styler, employee of the month every month. Productivity. Hey, homeboy. Hey, excuse me, brother. I see a man needing my services. (upbeat reggae music) 27.50, tax included. So the man says to me, "If I had 12 more like you, I'd be rich." (laughs) Hey, so how long you been out? - Couple days. How'd you know that? - Your tattoo. It's homemade. Took a lot of time. What's that mark on? Hey, hey, shit, it's cool, man. I've been down myself. I did a year in juvie. - Yeah, hard time. - I'm telling you, boy, it was some heavy, heavy shit too. I know what it's like to be fresh on the set. - Listen, man, I gotta go. - What's your hurry? - Jesus, 4.50 for a hamburger and a coffee? - Hey, man, don't sweat it. It's on me. Get me back next time, all right? - Thanks, man. - No problem. Hey, man. Hey, man, you mind if I walk with you? Look here. I got something I've been trying to put together. I've just been waiting for the right backup. - Yeah, I was wondering when you get around to it. - What do you mean, man? - Lemme guess. You're planning a big move, a fat score, then you're gonna kick back and live the life, right? - Yeah. Yeah. See, you and me on the same wavelength. That's how I knew you was one. - Yeah, how old are you, man? 20? - 21. What's that got to do with? Age is just a number. I know what's up. - Look, Bobby, man, you seem like a good kid. Why didn't you just stick to your jewelry business, man? And forget about robbing liquor stores or laundromats or whatever the hell's keeping you up at night. Because you know what? You ain't that guy. - Yeah? What do you know about it? - What do I know about it? (siren squealing) Nothing. That's all I wanna know. Understand? - Yeah. You know, you go on then. You see what's out there. Then come find me. Bobby Styler, Roosevelt Hotel. They know who I am. - [Dominick] Rudy, he' got no money. What should we do? - [Rudy] Another 24 hours, that's all he's got. Nobody steals from Rudy Baralli. (punches thudding) - [Dominick] I'm warning you, it's the last time. Punk. - These are for you. - Oh, thanks. They're, um, they're beautiful. Terry Griff, this is Dr. Russell Perry. - Not quite a doctor. One more year of residency. And this is Sylvia. She's a friend of mine, we work together. - Hi, it's nice to meet you. - [Russell] So where did the two of you meet? - [Jackie] Oh, Terry is a, a friend of the family. He's been away for a while. - Oh really? Where? - He, he's been outta town. - So free health insurance would be a disaster for medical professions. And it undermines the basic concept of our dynamic economy. - [Terry] No, thank you. - Russell, we see sick people every day. They are not interested in a dynamic economy. They just wanna get well. - People always get sick. Some recover, some don't. - Oh, Russell, you are so 16th century. - I mean, as a doctor, I try hard to fight the natural law of life. But in the end, we all have to accept the fact that some make it and some don't. - I don't know, that sounds very depressing. - So what do you think, Terry? Do you believe in fate? - No. Nobody's born to lose. Can go either way. Just depends what side of the fence you're on. - Interesting concept. Were you a philosophy student? - No. State convict. - Really? How long were you, uh? - In prison? 13 years. - Do you mind if I ask you something, man? - Go ahead. - What's it like in the joint, man? I mean, what's it really like? - Mostly you wait. - [Russell] Wait for what? - For life to begin or to end. - To end? You mean to be executed? - Russell? (chuckles) - I mean, murdered. - [Russell] Murdered? - [Terry] Yeah. - For what? - You're talking too much. (crickets chirping) (Jackie laughs) - (chuckles) Damn, it's getting late. We gotta go. I really wanted to say hi to Lorraine and the kids. - Well they, they're at their granny's. They won't be back till tomorrow. - Okay. - Terry, can we drop you somewhere? - No. Thanks. - I'll see you later, all right? - Goodbye. - Drive safe, you guys. - We will. - Thanks. - Good night. (door creaks) He can be a little uptight sometimes. (laughs) Oh my god. Russell, like, woke up and left. (laughs) Oh man. - Sorry about that. - That's all right. I should have told him the truth when you got here. - Yeah, kind of figured if he knew about Del then, you know, he might not- Why should he know about Del, Terry? I mean, there are friends of mine from work, you know, from the hospital? But you think I announced to the whole world I got a convict for a brother-in-law? You know, why should I be judged? You think I don't know about that fence you were talking about? Lo, the kids, and me, we all know. That's why we got to get out. And I wanna make that happen. (gentle piano music) (Jackie chuckles) You really must have scared him. Look at this. - Let me see. - Oh my god. (Jackie laughs) - Muscular contraction. After an intravascular injection of amnio sulfate results in. - Oh, in a dynamic economy? - Yeah, right. - Check this out. - What's that? Oh, yeah. - It's a stethoscope. You know how this works? - Let me see it. - Go like this. In your ear right here. Right. Like this. Can you hear me? - Yes. (both laugh) Okay, I want you to listen to my breath, all right. - Breast? - Breath. Here. Look. Here's, here's my lung right here. Right here. Okay? Okay, here I go. (inhales deeply) Ah. - Uh-oh. - What? - Last train in 10 minutes. - You better hurry. Hey. Oh (laughs). Woo. Mm. I, um, put a towel in the bathroom for you. - Thanks. You sure about this? Me staying over? - Yeah, yeah. They won't be back till tomorrow. (both laugh) Whoa. - Jackie, I had a real fun time tonight. Thanks. - I'm glad you could come. - [Terry] Me too. - Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. Jackie. - Hm? - Can you leave that open for me? - Okay. - [Terry] Thanks. - Okay. - Goodnight. (dramatic music) (train rumbling) (gun blasts) (people shouting) (Del screaming) (Terry grunting) - Terry, it's okay. Hey, Terry. Terry. (Terry moaning) Terry. Terry. Terry. Terry. Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (Terry breathes shakily) (breathing slows) (pensive piano music) Terry. Terry, how old were you when you went in? (pensive music) - I was 16. (melancholy music) (Terry mumbling) (melancholy music) - It's okay. Okay. (pensive piano music) (moves into tender music) (both breathing heavily) (tender piano music) (both breathing heavily) (tender piano music) - See you Friday, okay? - Okay. (bright piano music) (singer vocalizing) (baby laughing) (bright music) - Morning. - [Pedestrian] Hey. (bell jingles) (bright piano music) - Glad you to stopped by. - Listen, man, last night I missed my last train. Come on, man, gimme a break. I just was at the Reston's. Parole board knows about it. - They're not your residence, Terrence. - I made a mistake. It won't happen again. - That's more like you in every bunch. The minute I turn my back- - Please. I don't wanna be late for work. - You broke your parole, Terrence. - Terry. (siren blares) Aw, come on, man. - Don't man me, you little prick. - I told you it won't happen again. I promise. - I can get a arrest warrant in a minute. You fuck with me and I'll use it. I'll tell you what. I'll let it pass this time. Let's just say you owe me. - Thanks. - Say it. - I owe you. - Good. Now get cleaned up for work. Sorry, fellas, false alarm. How about some breakfast for your trouble? (fire roars) (door creaks) - [Jesse] It's Jesse, your neighbor. Open up, man. - What do you want? - I got a problem, man. Come on, open up. Hey, Terry, right? Listen, um, I'm Jesse. My PO's on his way. I need you to hold my stash for me. - What are you crazy, bringing this shit in my room? - Yours is gone, man. I can get three years for this shit. - Three years, this'd give me life. - Come on, man, do me this solid. I'll make it right for you. You want some pussy? I can get you some pussy, man. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. You know I'd do the same thing for you. (faucet shrieks) God damn, mother fucker- - Wrong with you, man. You done hurry to die? (water trickling) Find something else to do. (door slams) (water trickling) (fire roars) - Griff, here you go. (workers chattering) - Hey, Griff, what do you say you go out with us tonight? Grab a couple of beers. Chase some broads, huh? - No, thanks. Not tonight, man. - Okay, see you Monday. - Thanks. Hey, what's this? - [Foreman] Hey, Griff, you're gonna have to check that out with payroll. (workers chattering and laughing) - Looks okay to me. - It's not okay. - Didn't Price give you the deal? - No. What deal? - (chuckles) Son of a bitch did it again. Do you believe that asshole? - [Terry] What deal? - The fee. - I don't know what you're talking about. - The job fee. Third of your pay for the first six months. Then 20% after that, if you last. What, you think you just walk in here, fresh out of the lockup and go on full pay? - What I think? I think you and Price are trying to pull some jailhouse bullshit on me and pocket my money. - Look, I don't have time for this nonsense. Take it up with Price.

All right, look, I'm asking you. Can I go with you? Take me with you, please. - I'll think about it. - What? - All right, you can come. - I'll think about it. (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, I got 'em. See you then. (phone dings) That's it. - Are you sure you can do this? - It's already done. What if something goes wrong? - Ain't nothing going wrong. There ain't shit to it. All you gotta do is get your things together, relax your mind, and think about the country, all right? All right? - Yeah. - Well all right. Hey, you know I'd love to hang out and talk and all that, but that's just gimme my money. You know I ain't playing with you. Give me my money. Don't fuck around now. (suspenseful music) Who the fuck are you? Hey, where the fuck you going, Julie? We had a deal. Answer me, mother fucker. - Sorry, kid. - Yeah, I guess I better be going too, huh?

That little fucker steals my clothes, asks me if I want to buy 'em back. Who's your partner? Where is he? - Look, I told you, man. He's just some dude I met on the street. I don't even know his name. - Dominick. You take a good look at me, you little street punk. (Bobby gasping) I'm gonna burn your fucking eyeballs out. (blow torch hisses) - Come on, man, you don't have to do this. All right. Roosevelt Hotel, room 208. Now set it off, man. Set it off! (Bobby huffing) - Good boy. (tires screech) (suspenseful music) (gun blasts) (Dominick grunts) - Where's the kid? Where is he? Julie's Body Shop. 22nd and Ashland. - Pick up the cuffs. Face down on the bed, both of you. Come on, move it. Hands to the bars. Cuff your partner. (thugs grunting) Move it! (thug groans) You got cuffs? - Yeah, I got cuffs. - Cuff yourself. You, open your mouth. - Fuck! (grunts) (Dominick mumbles) - Move it. Open you mouth. You guys are pathetic, you know that? (thugs grunting) (door slams) - [Dominick] Fuck! (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) - So you two little street rats had it all figured out, didn't you? Front my paper and you can retire to the beach. (cans rattle) (chuckles) It's getting late. I don't think anybody's gonna show up. Do you? (Bobby huffing) That's too bad because I wanted your partner to watch me blow you up like a god damn, wire-haired balloon. (tires screech) Freeze or you're dead. Drop the piece. (gun rattles) Turn around. Griff? You got brass balls, you know that? It's too bad that so much time in the joint has numbed your brain. What are you sticking your neck out for lowlifes like this for? Huh? You're a dangerous man to have a friend. You got a habit of getting people killed, don't you? You should have learned in the joint, you go against me, pal, you're gonna lose. (Rudy grunts) (both grunting) (punches thudding) (Rudy groans) (paint hisses) (Rudy screams) Oh my god! My eyes, you son of a bitch! (screams) (paint can rattles) (gun blasting) (both grunt) (explosion roars) You fuck. Take it.

Come on, man, we're getting outta here. Come on, come on. - Get the bonds, Griff. Top drawer in the office. Go get it. (Rudy screaming) (objects clattering) (fire crackles) - Griff, don't leave me here. (glass shattering) Griff! (door slams) (Bobby coughing) - [Bobby] I'm sorry I told. - It's okay, don't worry about it. (Bobby coughing) (explosion booms) (door slams) (suspenseful music) (Terry coughs) (suspenseful music) (door slams) You all right? - I'm thirsty. - Tired? You wanna take a nap? It's cool. Get some z's, man. - Yeah, big move. Fat score, then we kick back and we live life. - Here you go. Live the life. Let it roll, Bobby. - Hey, Griff. Don't forget about me. - Never. (pensive music) (pensive music continues) (singer vocalizing) (Terry grunting) - Terry. You all right? You okay? I was really worried about you, you know? Terry, I can't go with you, okay? - I know. Just wanted to say goodbye. - You take care of yourself, okay? - Thank you, Jackie. Thank you.
