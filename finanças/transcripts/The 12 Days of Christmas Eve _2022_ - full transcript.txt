Can I try? Careful. It's hot. Ok, right there. Right there. Ok. Try again. Don't give up. The only way to succeed is with hard work. That-a boy. All right, let's try. Can we work on the music box now? Not today. We have to go to mrs. Martin's house to fix her stove. But it's christmas eve. Exactly, which is why she's paying extra for me to fix it, so she can cook christmas dinner tomorrow for her family. How do you think I paid for all those gifts waiting for you under the tree? We have to earn our gifts in life through hard work and sacrifice. You understand? Yes, sir. I just... I wish you didn't have to work on christmas eve. I do all of this so you can have a better life than me. One day, you'll be rich and successful. All your christmas wishes will come true. Come on, brian, let's make a wish together. You ready? And in other news, santa will have a harder time delivering gifts this christmas eve. It seems that ginger the reindeer has escaped from the local petting zoo. Sounds like ginger has finally snapped. Ahh! Oh. Ah, merry christmas, brian. Still no decorations, huh? Some of us are busy working for a living. Besides, it's not christmas day until tomorrow. Well, managing my trust fund takes a lot of work. I'm sure your parents are very proud. Well, yeah, they ac... - oh, whoa, be careful. There's a slippery patch there. Merry christmas, folks. Good morning, mr. Conway. What makes it good, jet? - Nothing. It's a horrible day, sir. You'll never get anywhere in life with that kind of negative attitude. There is an ice slick out front. It is a lawsuit waiting to happen. On it, sir. You have the board meeting at 9:00. And I need you to sign off on some of these details for the christmas carnival fundraiser tonight. Ugh, christmas. Schmoozing with a bunch of people I don't even like. The hell is this? Never show me one of these again. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. I'm disappointed in you. Just think about all the joy this party brings to people every year. Or think about all the money you'll be raising for the hospital. And it's a giant tax write-off. - Oh. Now there's a ray of sunshine. Morning, all. How are the numbers on our big pre-christmas event, hmm? Did the coupons we mailed out bring in the business we'd hoped for? I'm afraid the numbers aren't good. We are down... 20% from last christmas, which is down... 10% from the year before that one. Well, we're just going to have to work harder. I would like a plan for improving our retail sales on my desk by the end of the day. I don't care if you have to work all night. Um, it's christmas eve, sir. I took my father's tiny appliance repair shop and turned it into a multimillion-dollar electronics retail chain, number one in the region. I didn't do it by taking days off. It took hard work and sacrifice. That is the key to success. But I am a benevolent boss, so if anyone can come up with a solution right away then you may all get home in time to put out a plate of cookies for santa. Anyone? Well... some of our research shows that pc electric is not reaching our younger client base. What about a rebrand? Something fresher, more electric? I love that idea. We could hire a marketing firm geared towards millennials and gen z. Maybe connect with some influencers. Oh, that sounds ridiculous. And expensive. How am I supposed to finance that? We could get an investor. Uh, I know business has been off for a while, so I've been researching potential investors in my spare time... When I'm home alone, because I live alone and I have no life outside of this job. I mean, I do have a hamster. But she's ignoring me right now, because I ran out of her favorite organic carrot crackers... - Focus, jet! - Sorry. So the other day, I heard from nina nishi that she might be interested in investing. Oh, wait, nina nishi? As in the founder of pocket. That's the shopping app, right? How do you possibly know her? She follows my hamster fashion account. Oh. Anyway, she's in town today, actually. So I could set up a lunch or something. Why would she invest in us? So she just sold pocket for a ton of money, and she's looking for her next project. She seems to think pc electric might be it. Fine. Set it up. Nina wants to meet you at the store so she can check it out. So I don't have to pay for lunch, perfect. I should warn you, though, she's a bit, um, unpredictable. - What does that mean? - Papa! - Harkin! Michelle. What a surprise. Hi. I have a surgery scheduled today, and my nanny just called in sick. Dave is in paris with his new girlfriend. I need someone to watch her again. - You want me to babysit? What about your mother? Well, besides the fact that I trust her even less with a child than I trust you, she is in brazil in a yurt, ironically enough searching for her inner child. Ha. I... you can just put her in a conference room with her ipad. She won't bother anyone, right, sweetie? - I can do a cartwheel. Want to see? Well, maybe later, sweetie. I can't. Today's a really busy day with work. Please, dad, I'm desperate. This is a really important surgery. - I would love to. It's just not a good day. I'm really good at cartwheeling. I'm sure you are. I'll figure it out. It's fine. Come on. So I'm not going to play with papa today? No, no, not today, sweetie. Michelle. You'll be at the carnival later? After all, it is a fundraiser for your hospital. Of course. I always do what's expected of me. Come on, let's go. Boy, today could not end soon enough. Think we'd have more people here, the day before christmas. I'm sure it'll pick up with last-minute shoppers. Oh, there she is! Nina. - Jet. It is so good to finally meet you in person. This man is a creative genius. - Oh, stop it. Hamsters are the new ferrets. - If you say so. - I do. I have very good instincts about animals... And people. Shall I show you around the place? - Oh, of course. - After you, please. Thank you. Whoa. Love it, love it. So old-fashioned and out of touch. Well, I prefer the term "classic." - gumdrop? - Oh, no thank you. - Oh, come on. Just... nah, nah, nah, nah. Mm. Listen, I've been running the numbers jet sent. Your overhead is too high, but there's a real opportunity to leverage market share by expanding the omni-channel retail strategy. I'm definitely interested. We have been experiencing some... Some supply chain issues. Is that the newest pok√©mon game? I'll take all of them. What will you do with so many? Give them away, of course. I mean, I love buying presents. What fun is being rich if you don't spend it? Speaking of spending money, I hear you have a big fundraiser tonight. Yes, for bradley hospital. We're raising money for the new children's wing. You should come. I know how much you love christmas. Presents and shiny decorated trees and santa and candy everywhere. I mean, who doesn't love christmas? Oh, I love christmas. I knew we'd get along. All right, I've gotta run. There's a gingerbread house eating contest I plan on winning. I'll see you tonight and we'll talk later. See you there. You know, I'm starting to like this day. I may even be feeling some of that christmas spirit they talk about. No, that's just heartburn. Thank you so much for coming. Oh, heavens... well, listen, save a dance for me, ok? Brad, bernadette, go have a couple of drinks. We'll talk about your checkbook later. Take care. Oh, dr. Angeloni, thanks for coming. With the money you raise for the hospital and the work your daughter does for us, I'm the one who should be thanking you. It's the least I can do for the children. Merry christmas, brian. - Sarah brown. How long has it been? Since you broke my heart? As I recall, you're the one who broke up with me. I got tired of waiting for you to come home from the office. I was building a business. Silly me. I was building a life. Well, what brings you here? Was it to see me? No, I volunteer at the hospital. I'm here on a date. I should go find him. Merry christmas, brian. - Oh, great, you made it. - Yeah. - Let me introduce you... My daughter, the brilliant surgeon. She works at bradley, you know. It's been a bit of a rough day, dad. I'm sorry, I have to go talk to someone important. - you know what? Just give me the whole can. Did you just tip him $100 for a whole can of whipped cream? It should be $200, right? I mean, it's christmas. I'm glad you could make it. I can't resist a good christmas party. This is not a good christmas party, though. I mean, it's called a christmas carnival, but there's no games, there's no fun, there's not even a santa claus. You should dress up as santa. That will never happen. It's really not that kind of party, anyway. It's more of a fundraiser for the kids. Well, people would give a lot more if there were actual kids here, having fun, opening presents, spreading sticky candy cane joy everywhere. I'll keep that in mind for next year. Well, next year you won't have to worry about it. Why is that? Because I don't want to invest in your company. I want to buy it. Buy it? The whole thing? I'm an only child. I might like to give things away, but I don't like to share. I need to be in charge. This company, it's my whole life. I'm gonna bypass the deep sadness of that statement and just point out, you're gonna make a lot of money in this deal. You'll be so rich that you will never have to worry about money again. You'll be able to do whatever you want. You won't have to answer to anyone. Your life will be all about you. It's a family business. My father... - Would want this for you. You took his tiny, struggling shop and turned it into a company worth millions. Think of how proud he would be. You'd have to promise to keep the fundraiser every year. Bradley hospital is very important in this community. Of course. Why not? - Really? - Yes. I have worked hard. It's time I got what I deserved, huh? Let's drink to that. Here's to my just desserts. Mm. - Mm. - Ah. You know, I'm beginning to like this day. I wish it would never end. Sir, it's time for your speech. Oh, right. Yeah, I'll just go spread the good news. Mm. Good evening, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the pc electric christmas carnival. I'd like to thank you for your support for bradley hospital and for giving so generously of your time... And your money too. Now, my commitment to the hospital isn't based solely upon the fact that my brilliant daughter, michelle, happens to be a surgeon there. There she is, yes, yes. Don't be so shy, honey. But I am also dedicated to this community. And in the name of community, I would like to announce that I intend to forgo the customary christmas bonuses this year and instead give a sizable donation to the hospital on behalf of my employees. - So we get nothing. - And he gets a tax write-off. Generous and business savvy. The man is a machine. It's the least I can do. And the least you can do is go have some fun. Enjoy yourselves, please. May your christmas be full of gifts, preferably purchased from pc electric. Go on out there. Enjoy yourselves. Thanks again for coming. How was that? Pretty great, I'd say, huh? Huh? Yeah, you were great, yeah. It's just been kind of a tough day for me. Listen, something else has come up. I'm thinking about selling the company to nina nishi. - Who? What? You're selling the company? What are you gonna do? What's gonna happen to your employees? That's not my problem. - Brian. Brian, come on! Let's celebrate! We'll talk about it later. Oh, my. I had no idea you were so much fun. The heck is going on? Merry christmas, brian. It's not christmas yet. Ooh, you're right. And I'm afraid it never will be for you again. Am I dead? Pretty much. I'm just here to send you on your way. The angel of death is santa? It's different for everyone. And, well, tis the season. - But I'm not ready to die. Not today. I'm just about to get everything I ever wanted. Really? Are you sure about that? Please, give me a second chance. I'll do anything. Well, you're not quite on the naughty list, but you've never been particularly nice. I'll change. I promise, I'll work harder. I'll do better. Just let me live. Oh, you know, I'm feeling generous today. I'll tell you what, I'll give you 12 days to get it right. 12 days of christmas eve. Oh, 12 days. 12 days. So I'm not gonna die. Well, that's up to you. If by the time the 12 drummers drumming have beaten their last note, you still haven't figured out the true meaning of christmas... The true meaning of life... Well, then, it's off to that giant christmas tree farm in the sky. I promise, I'll learn it. I'll live it. I won't let you down. Blow out the candle and go deck those halls. Is that... Weird dream. And in other news, santa will have a harder time delivering gifts this christmas eve. It seems that ginger the reindeer has escaped from the local petting zoo. Sounds like ginger has finally snapped. Ah, merry christmas, brian. Yes. It's not christmas, is it? It's still christmas eve. It was all a dream. Ok. Oh, whoa, be careful. There's a slippery patch there. Merry christmas, folks. I'm afraid the numbers aren't good. We are down... 20% from last christmas, which is down... 10% from the year before that. Some of our research shows that pc electric is not reaching our younger client base. What about a rebrand? Something fresher, more electric? - She doesn't want to invest. She wants to buy the company. Who is she? Nina nishi. How do you know that? She told me yesterday. You spoke with nina nishi yesterday? It wasn't a dream. It happened, and it's happening again. What's happening again, sir? I can't... I can't breathe. It's real. Santa was real. I've got to get out of here. Are you ok? Do you need cpr? Have to find santa. Have to find santa. Papa! Oh, I can't watch her today. I can't! How did you know I was gonna ask that? Because it's the second day of christmas eve. Gotta find santa. I gotta find santa. - Hey, watch out for the... ah! Oh, damn. Well, that was quick. Why are you doing this to me? You asked for this. You begged me. You said you wanted to live. We made a deal. You said you would do better. This isn't a dream, and it isn't a joke. You've already wasted one day. You've got ten days left. Don't blow it. You just watch. I'm gonna make this the merriest christmas eve anybody has ever seen. Oh, hey. Merry christmas, brian. Jason, have you ever seen one of those time loop movies where a person gets stuck in the same day over and over again? Oh, yeah, I love those. How do they usually get out of it? Well, they usually get out of it when they stop being selfish and start helping other people. - Exactly. Yes, that's it. That's the answer. - Well, yeah. To what? - To life. All I have to do is make everybody's christmas wish come true, and I'll live. This is gonna be so easy! Ooh, he's cracking up. Morning, sam. Merry christmas! So since the christmas spirit is all about giving and caring for others, I have decided to give you all the week off. And I'm going to give you a 10% raise and a week's salary as a bonus. Everyone? Yes, jet, everyone, including you. Although I do still need your help with the christmas carnival stuff this evening, all right? I have to raise as much money as I possibly can for santa. I mean, for the hospital, of course. How are we going to pay for all of this? The numbers are down. We'll worry about that tomorrow, dale. Today, our only concern is that everyone is happy. Ooh, that reminds me, I'd better get going if I'm going to get all of my good deeds in today. Papa! Oh, guys, guys, hi. Listen, this... this should... Should cover a sitter. And I'll tell you what, no... why don't you just take the day off and go shopping on me? What's going on? - Can't talk! Gotta go save the world! Whoa, whoa, hey, listen. Didn't get me this time, huh? Oh, sorry, I'll have to owe you. I'm fresh out of cash. Wow, there's a lot of them. What the heck. I'll take them all. Ah! Stop! Stop! Excuse me. Excuse me, miss. Thank you. Merry christmas. Here we are. A little something for you, just because it's christmas. And how about a nice big green box? Come to my party later. Oh, look. Yes, a little triceratops. Give that to a youngster you know. Hello, my friend. Here you are. What am I supposed to do with this? - Well, whatever you like. You see how unselfish I am? Merry christmas. You see, santa? You see all the nice things I'm doing? You can't kill me now. Santa kills people? No. It was a joke. I was kidding. Here, have a toaster. That one doesn't count. My goodness, I love this jacket. You know what, I haven't seen that since... What was that movie with dennis hopper? Brian has lost his mind. And most of next year's budget. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here and supporting me and bradley hospital. I have been selfish and stingy sometimes, but that is all about to change. Now, I am interested only in giving. After all, isn't that the meaning of christmas? So let's keep giving to bradley hospital and to each other. Aha! Merry christmas. You guys, you came. Oh, this is wonderful. Did you see? Did you see that? Did you see how generous I was? Dad, what is going on? I am making everybody's christmas wishes come true. Ooh, speaking of making wishes come true, wait till you see what I got you. Jet. It's the dog you always wanted. She's allergic. Barely. A few sniffles never hurt anybody. - Let's go, let's go. - What? I have to get her some benadryl. - Why? - Ok? Michelle. Oh. Oh! I was only trying to make her happy. She doesn't need a dog to make her happy or any of the 10,000 presents you had delivered today. She just needs a grandfather who pays attention to her. I was paying attention. I knew she wanted a dog. I got her a dog. Ok, well, we will see you at christmas tomorrow. And get that animal out of here. Oh! Oh! This is pointless. If helping all those people doesn't get me to christmas day, then nothing will. Who were you helping besides yourself? And what would an 80-year-old grandmother do with an electric razor? Did you happen to notice her facial hair? All right, all right, all right. I get it. I'll think of a better gift. Christmas isn't about gifting. It's about giving. Giving what? Well, that's something you'll have to figure out on your own. These numbers are unacceptable. If you people can't come up with a plan to improve them, I'm just gonna sell the whole company and hope they fire each and every one of you. Jet, get me an appointment with nina nishi. She's in town and she's interested. Wait, I was gonna... But how do you know that? I don't pay you to ask questions. I pay you to do what I tell you. Yes, sir. No one appreciates what I do. I am tired of working this hard and getting nothing in return. When is it my turn? When do I get what I want? What do you want, sir? To be happy, just like everybody else. Papa! Harkin, hi! And you, my beloved child, here to tell me again what a selfish person I am for not wanting to watch my granddaughter. Not wanting to watch my granddaughter go another day without telling her how much I love her. What? Don't you have a very important surgery today? You need someone to look after her, I will. - You will? - You will? Of course, no problem. - Yay! Can I show you my cartwheel? Maybe a little later. Thanks, dad. I wouldn't ask if I wasn't desperate. I know how busy you are. It's really generous of you. From your lips to santa's ears. Ok, then. I will see you guys at the carnival tonight. - Great. - Great. Have a good surgery. Yeah. After all, it's not like I haven't raised a child of my own. And you're a good kid. How hard could it be? - Can I have a nintendo switch? - No. - Can I have an iphone? - No. - Can I show you my cartwheel? - No. - Can I get a puppy? - No. Jet, when does nina get here? Any minute. Listen, take her, give her some candy or something. Just to keep her distracted. Are you sure? She's already had two hot chocolates and, like, five candy canes, so... - I don't care. Just keep her away. - Yes, sir. Come on, harkin, let's go. Oh, nina, how lovely to see you. Well, I am so happy to be here. Papa, I don't feel good. I'm sorry about this. This is my granddaughter, harkin. How sweet, learning the family business already. Yes, you know me, all about the children. I want to go home. Not now, honey. Papa has to finish this meeting. I want to go home now. Kids. Just give me one more minute, all right? Maybe I should come another time. No, no. No. I'll just go wash up. It's fine. You should come to the christmas carnival tonight. Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll talk then. I feel much better now. You're happy here, honey? Nina can't make it. She said she'll meet you in town next time she's here. - No, it has to be today. There's no tomorrow. Tomorrow is today. Yesterday is today. Now is all I have. That's so deep. I'm sorry I'm late. I had a rough day. Oh, did you? Did it involve getting puked on? Or losing out on the business deal of a lifetime? 'cause that was my day. I'm sorry, papa. Oh, it wasn't your fault, sweetie. Really? Now what? You're on the right track. You're just going in the wrong direction. Maybe try asking harkin where she wants to go? Mmm! Thanks, dad. Are you sure you can keep her all day? We'll see you at the carnival. Great. - Bye. - Bye. Well, harkin, what would you like to do? Today is your day. Really? Really. Today is all about you. Oh, my god. You're a mess. Oh... oh, yeah, everybody needs a triceratops. Let's try to... Oh, yes, take that for sure. Oh, boy. Whew. I have not been sledding in a long time, not since your mother was a little girl. Gosh this is... this is fun, huh? This is the best day ever. You know those kids? They go to my school. Why don't you go on down there and play with them? They don't like me. Oh, come on, harkin. You gotta make some friends, you know. If you're gonna be a leader, you gotta have some followers. No. Why are you being so difficult? You're acting just like your mother. Yeah, well, I'd rather be like her than you. She's right, you are just a mean old man. Harkin. Harkin, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm coming. I'm coming. Ahh! I gave her everything she wanted. You did, but what about what she needs? And then benjamin farted and the whole class smelled like dead fish. That is terrible. It was awesome. What is it about those kids that makes you look so sad? They think I'm weird. Everyone thinks I'm weird. You know what you have to do to make those kids like you? What? Nothing. Huh? Do you like them? Not really. Do you like yourself? Yes. Then that's all that matters. Because you are amazing. And life is too short to worry about people who do not appreciate your big, beautiful heart. How did you get to be so smart, papa? - I'm still learning... Something new every day. Let's play a song. Oh, yeah, good idea, let me pull a quarter out... I have a quarter. You put it up there. It's broken. It's too bad I don't have my tools. You know what, I bet I could fix this. You can fix stuff? Yeah. Actually, I'm pretty good at it. I can fix things. Can you teach me how to fix stuff? Let's find out. This is where it all started. My dad, your great grandfather, was a real whiz at fixing things. And he and I would go to the junkyard together, and we'd find some stuff, and we would fix it together. When your mom was little, I'd come out here late at night and tinker just to take my mind off of things at work. Boy, it's been forever since I've been out here. Let's get started. You need to know some of the basics, all right? This here, this is a wire stripper and a pair of pliers, needle nose they call them. Almost everything you need to do in any kind of repair work, you have to use screwdrivers. You see that? Ok, cool. Here's what we'll do. You take the negative and I'll place this on the positive. You see that? There you go, that's it, honey. Yeah. Very good. Ok, great. Now, let's give her a try. You can do the honors. Well, here, hang on. Let's adjust a little bit. It works. We fixed it. This is the best day ever. Now, that's enough of that. I wish I could fix my mom like we fixed the radio. What's the matter with your mom? She works too hard and she's stressed out all the time. If I had one christmas wish, it would be for her to be happy. Well, you know what, let's just see what I can do about that. After all, I'm pretty good at fixing things, aren't I? Really? You're the best. - you're the best, kid. Hey, you know what? We got some time before the carnival, why don't we go over and deflate all of jason's christmas decorations? Come on. - That sounds naughty. Let's do it! Hey. Today was awesome. Can I spend every day with papa? Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. What is going on here? I'm gonna go get some cookies. Ok, we'll see you in a little bit. Is this the twilight zone? More like groundhog day. What? We went shopping together. I taught her how to love herself. And then we went to the workshop and fixed an old radio together. You let her go in your workshop? You never let me go in there. Now, I've got a great surprise for you. You've been working so hard lately at the hospital, with harkin, and all the volunteer work you do. You've done so much for everybody else, I thought it was time someone did something for you. So I called you boss. You're free for the week. We're going to the bahamas tomorrow. Tomorrow is christmas. I'd like to spend christmas at home. I don't want to be on a plane. - But... and those are really important surgeries I have next week. Honey, you need to have a break. - You don't know what I need. You never have. You were always too busy working to know what I needed. I did that for you. No, it wasn't for me. It was so that you could prove to the world and to your father what a success you were. You've never loved me. - That is not true. - Well, that's how it felt. Come on, harkin. We'll make... - I want a cookie. No, we'll make some cookies at home, ok, honey? Hey b-man, I heard you were looking for investors. Let's talk. Not the best time, nina. Make it quick, santa. So what have you learned so far, brian? I've learned how important my family is to me. How their happiness is what matters. I want to make harkin's wish come true. I want michelle to be happy. I want to make her love me again. But I... I just don't know how. Well, you've got six days to figure it out. Don't give up. Christmas is just around the corner. Christmas or die. That is the choice, right? Afraid so. Well, then, I choose christmas. "better off alone." "raised by wolves." "when parents don't care about you." I care. I'd say I'm more of a bear than a wolf. What's that, papa? Oh, nothing, honey. You know, I'd like to get something really special for your mom for christmas this year. What does she like? She likes food carved to look like animals, animals dressed up like food, she likes pretzels dipped in frosting, rolled in sprinkles, and she likes dancing in her pajamas to irish folk songs. Her favorite is... how did you know that? I used to sing it to her when she was a little girl, just like my dad sang it to me. Mostly she likes helping people. That's why we have all those bills. She's always giving her money away to charity. Well, and all those massive student loans you made or take out to teach her "fiscal responsibility." yes, everybody has to learn that nothing in this life is for free. Mom and j.Lo say that love don't cost a thing. Oh. Well, today, at least these christmas cookies are for free. With milk? Just like santa. Here comes the big finish. Wait for it. That always used to make your mom laugh her head off. And then it was lights out. Here we are. I told you not to call me today. I know, sir, but it's nina nishi. She wants to meet with you. She's very interested in investing. Well, look, I promised harkin that I would teach her how to fix a radio. Training her to take over the family business? Maybe. That gives me an idea. Thanks for coming all the way out. Yeah. Oh, that's my granddaughter there, harkin. - Hi. - I promised her we'd fix something together. Oh, that's so sweet. My grandfather also loved to fix things. It's one of the reasons I'm interested in pc electric. It reminds me of him. Would you like to have a seat? Oh, no, go ahead. Oh, thank you. Now, I have been doing some research. And it's my understanding that in order to make whipped cream, you've got to have some heavy cream, a few drops of vanilla, some powdered sugar, and you whip it until you get stiff peaks. Am I right? Hmm? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Oh, so good. Look, I'm not gonna waste your time. I'm gonna be honest with you. Pc electric is struggling. We need an investor. I can stay stuck in the past and, apparently, in the present. But if I want to save my company, I have to look to the future. I believe you are the kind of person who can lead me to tomorrow. What makes you think that? Well, like I said, I've done my research. You graduated top of your class at harvard business school. Hm. All the startup companies you've invested in, every one is making strides in innovation and in market share. You know how to work hard. And you go after what you want. Well, work is pretty much all I have going on in my life, so I better be good at it, right? What about your family, friends, love? I'm not really good at that stuff. It's just easier right now to just focus on work. There'll be plenty of time for family and friends later. That's what I used to think, but I was wrong. Sometimes you just gotta reach out and eat that cookie. Oh, yeah. Oh, wait. Mm-mm. Oh! Do you like the cookies I made? You made these? Oh, my god, they're so... I'm sorry, I cannot lie to this face. They're horrible. What? Ew, gross. Papa! How is this my fault? It was a mix. Whew! I've never seen you quite so loose, brian. What happened to that tight grip you always had? It's a lot more fun when you let go. Hmm. Sara. Yeah? I wonder... oh, sorry. Have fun. - come on. All right, now. What's this one? Oh, I like that. I like that. Honey. What's the matter, honey? You look upset. It's just... my patient, they almost died during surgery. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I... I could have done things differently. I should... I should be better. No. You are smart, kind, and hardworking. Maybe I don't say this enough, but I'm proud of you, and I always have been. Thank you. Did somebody spike the eggnog? Not yet, but the night is young. Yeah, go dance. - You sure? Today was a rough one for her. She told me. She thinks she's a bad surgeon. - Ridiculous. She's one of our best. Her patient had a brain bleed that no one caught until it was almost too late. She's too hard on herself. Good thing she has a father like you, always looking out for her. Ok. Well, I had the most wonderful time with you today. You are a great kid. Yep, my mom tells me all the time. Hey, why don't you go get some candy canes, hon? Ok. I don't know what's gotten into you, but thank you for watching harkin and for whatever medication or food substitution that has somehow managed to shift you from scrooge to santa. Santa is not the saint some people think he is. Oh, really? You know this how? Let's just say he has decked my halls several times, thank you very much. Oh, ok, well, the next time you see him, tell him I said hi and that I'm still waiting on that cabbage patch kid he owes me. Speaking of things that are owed, I know I wasn't really around for you that much when you were growing up, but I am here now, and I have a very special early christmas gift to give you. I have paid off your debts and your student loans. How do you know how much debt I have? Well, I happened to look through your mail earlier. You looked through my mail? It was just sitting out, and I thought... so you're spying on me? No, no, it's just... I wanted to do something nice for you. I love you. I'm not a spreadsheet, dad. You can't just clear up your debt by paying off mine. That's... - What do you want then? I don't want your money. I just... I want a dad who doesn't have to ask me that question. - Hey, come on. You ready? - Ok. Let's go do all of our fun christmas traditions, ok? I am gonna figure this out. You hear me, santa? I'm gonna make her happy, and I'm gonna make her love me again. I'm gonna show you... oh, you sure showed me, huh? Just shut your chimney hole. Dr. Angeloni, I was hoping you could do me a favor. Papa! - Harkin! - I don't understand. That surgery's been on the schedule for weeks. I don't need a day off. Yes, dr. Angeloni, whatever you think is best. Of course, yeah. I'll see you tonight. What's wrong? I was just coming here to ask if you could watch harkin during my surgery, but it just got taken off the schedule. I don't get it. I'm sure they have their reasons. Yeah, maybe dr. Angeloni doesn't think I'm good enough. Well, I know for a fact that's not true. Maybe they just wanted to give you a little time off. Ok, well, we don't need to bother you now. Why don't we get going? - No, no, no, wait, wait. Please, please. Maybe we could spend the day together. I could ditch work and... And we can go out and do some of that christmas stuff that you guys always do. You'd ditch work to do christmas stuff? Or other stuff, whatever you like. I want to go sledding and sing christmas carols and bake cookies and eat cookies and... that sounds like a great day. What is this? What's going on? Are you dying? I hope not. Look, I know you don't think I know who you are or what you need. You're right. I was so busy trying to give you a better tomorrow I wasn't in any of your todays. But I'm here now. Today is your day. Show me who you are. Ok. Ok. Where to? You'll see. Oh, and you'll need different clothes. Ah. Thank you. Hi. These are really big. - there you are. Thank you. Let's move on. You know, that was actually kind of fun. - Yeah, you were amazing. - Yeah. Yeah, jet. - Just wait a second. - Yeah. Ok. Guys, I have to stop by the shop before we go ice skating. Why? Just a little work thing. A little work thing? Yeah, well, there's this investor in town and I have to meet with her. You guys can play video games while we wait. Yay! I thought you said today was just about us, that you weren't going to work. I did say that, but this just came up. Something always just comes up. Yeah, and how do you think I paid for all the donations we just made? You have to earn your gifts with hard work and sacrifice. When will you understand that? - Oh, I do. I love my job and I have sacrificed for my career, but never at the expense of my family and never on christmas eve. Fine, I won't go. Maybe one day I'll be able to forget all of the times that you chose work over me, but today is not that day. I'm trying. Yeah, well, try harder. Jet, I'm not gonna make it. Oh, come on. I am not giving up. - there you go. Yep. Looks really good. - For you. - You can just... you know what... in his pipe and smoke it. Do you remember that music box you gave me when I was 12? The one with the clock on it? - Yeah. - Yeah. My dad found it at a yard sale. We fixed it together. It's a very valuable collectible. That's why you were so mad at me when I broke it. Gosh, I begged you to fix it for me, but you never had the time. I'm sorry. I got the time now. I gave it away years ago. All I ever wanted was for you to love me. Oh, honey, I do love you. I always did. I wish I could believe that. It's just too late. You can't make up for lost time. What is it gonna take for me to prove to you that I love you, that I am ready to be a good father, the kind of father who deserves to be loved again? Can you go back in time and fix that clock? I didn't think so. We'll just see about that. Well, that was a surprise. I didn't want to wait another minute. I got it. I find that clock. I fix it. I give it to her, then she knows that I love her. Then she loves me too. And then I get to live. You see, I get it now. The meaning of christmas, the meaning of life, it's love. My love, her love, harkin's love. Love is everything. You're right, it is. But there's something else you should know about... Oh. Jet, I have every confidence in you. You are my number one guy. Now, this was a limited edition, and... I know they made several of them, though. So you'll be able to find one, and buy it, no matter what the condition and no matter what the cost. Are you ok? This isn't like you. Is there something you're not telling me? Oh, my god, are you dying? - Not today. - Ok. Oh, and I need it for the carnival tonight. Chop, chop. - Yes, sir. - I'll text it to you. - Ok. Ah, there you go. And this one. Oh, I have an idea for that one. We have something very special for you, young man. Perfect. Hi. - Hi. Really surprised me this year. So here you are, young man. This is great, yes. - Sure to warm you up. Let me come around and help you. Come on. There you go. Oh, I needed this. Wow, I don't know why I don't have one of these in my office. - Can I have one? - Sure, why not, kid? - Oh, no, dad. She is eight years old. She doesn't need a massage chair. Have you watched the news lately? Climate change, inflation, supply chain issues for pok√©mon cards. It's a very stressful time to be a kid these days. She does have a point. You still don't need a massage chair, ok? I wish this day would never end. Don't say that. Because then christmas wouldn't come, and you'd miss all those presents from santa. - Oh, right. I've been very good this year. I'm going to get a lot of presents. Oh, you really think so? It has been a really wonderful day. It's been a long time since I felt part of a family. I love you. Surprise! - Oh, nina. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, jet told me you were busy, but he slipped up and said you were at the store, so I thought I'd swing by so we could talk business. I've run the numbers and I'm super interested in investing. - Who is this? - This is nina nishi. She's... she's... Well, a possible investor. Gosh, I... I would love to be in business with you, but today I promised my daughter and my granddaughter that we would spend the day together. And I've broken a lot of promises in the past. I'm not gonna do that anymore. So I hope you understand. - Wow. From everything I heard about you, this was not what I was expecting. You're very lucky to have a dad that shows up for you. Yeah, I am. I'll talk to jet. We'll schedule something for after the holidays. - Great. - Wait, wait. Will you just wait... Wait a second? Go, meet with her. - But honey, I... - Listen, I know that the business has been struggling. And harkin and I can just sit in the massage chairs. Are you sure? Of course. I don't deserve a daughter like you. Yesterday, I would have agreed with you. But today... today, maybe you do. Go. We'll be right here. - Ok. Nina? - Yes. - All right. - Thanks for waiting. Lower back. Whoa, that... Yeah, that feels good. Oh! You know what I just realized? This is a christmas carnival, and there's no games or prizes, and there's no santa. You should dress up as santa, papa. Yes. That's never gonna happen. Please. A man must hold on to some dignities, and not dressing as santa is one of mine. Even the grinch dressed up as santa. My father dressed as santa every year. And I am not my father. I am no santa. If you say so. Want to get some snacks? - Yeah. Let's go. Jet, where are you? If you're not here in ten minutes, I swear I'm gonna fire you. No, I don't mean it. Just hurry! You know, I'm sick of that martini. Just... may I have some gin on the rocks? Make it a double. Merry christmas, brian. It isn't christmas until tomorrow, is it? Sorry, I just wanted to... and tomorrow never comes, does it? It's always just today. Today, over and over again. And today is my last day. My last day. Do you understand? Are you ok? No, I'm not. I... I want more time. I have to get that clock, that... that music box clock. That will get me to tomorrow, which actually is christmas. - You're right. It's not christmas yet. I hope you find everything that you're looking for, brian. Who was that? It's just a ghost of christmas past to remind me what a horrible man I am. Why is there no santa at this party? Papa has dignities. Ok. I've been thinking. I don't want to invest in your company. Of course not. - I want to buy it. - Buy it? Yes, the whole thing. It's the only thing that makes sense for me and for you. Just think, you won't have to worry about money ever again, and you can spend more time with your family. - Ok. - Really? - Really? - Really. But, dad, this company, it's your whole life. Well, maybe it's time it wasn't anymore. - I'm here! I've got it! Please, don't fire me. - Jet. - Finally. Michelle... mm-hmm? I know I was never the father you deserved. And you did deserve better. And I promise I'm going to be better from now on, because I'm proud of you, and I love you, and I hope this gift shows you how much I care. It's a clock. - Yes, it's... It's the music box clock I gave you when you were 12. Yeah, the one that you wouldn't help me fix when it broke. No, no... I know, I... I... But... but... but it's fixed now. I mean, I found a new one for you. I got this for you. Just open it. Thanks. You said that if I fixed it, we could have a second chance. You said if I gave you this, it would prove that I loved you. I'm just gonna let you guys talk in private. I never said that. Yes, you did, on the balcony. I've never been on the balcony. Yes, you were. I tracked it down today. And... and jet drove all over town trying to find it. Oh, so jet got this for me. No, we... well, yes, but... it was a lot of driving, all those last-minute shoppers. Well, thank you, jet. I appreciate your effort. Come on, honey. I'm guessing that didn't go how you had hoped. I can fix this. Hey, everyone, can I have your attention? Come on in here. Don't be shy. What is she doing? Hi. Merry christmas, everyone. I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is nina nishi. And I just wanted to say thank you to our generous hosts, brian conway and pc electric, for all the hard work they've done. Come on up here, brian. Come on up. Come on. Come on up. This man has worked so hard over the years to build this company up and to give back to the community, which is why after all that hard work and sacrifice, he's finally gonna reward himself by selling me the company. What did she say? What are you doing? I know we haven't discussed the details, but I'm just so excited, I couldn't wait. And don't worry, I will be a very generous boss, if and when I fire you after breaking the company into pieces and selling off the parts. This is not what we discussed. This is the only thing that makes business sense. - Listen, everyone. - Brian. There's been a misunderstanding. - But... - No one is getting fired. Please, go back to the party and enjoy yourselves. And you, just get out. Go. Hit the bricks. Did you ask dr. Angeloni to take me off the schedule today? No. Ok, yes, yes, but only because... that patient almost died during the surgery. If I had done the surgery... the same thing would have happened. Well, thank you for having faith in me as a surgeon. No, that patient had a brain bleed. It doesn't matter who operated. What... what are you talking about? You know what? I don't care. I thought you had changed. You sure fooled me. - You're right. I wasn't there for you. I don't deserve you. I'm a horrible father. And I'm a horrible boss. And I'm a horrible human being. Oh, you're right. You're all right. Oh, my god. - Whoa. Whoa. - Dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Papa. Hey, dad. Dad, hey. Hey. - Papa, papa. - I'm sorry. - Are you ok, papa? - Dad, stay with me, please. Papa. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. I tried. I know. The worst thing isn't that I won't wake up tomorrow. It's that everybody else will. They'll wake up on christmas day with the wreckage I left behind. A failing business. My broken family. I wish I could have one more day, not that I could live any longer, but that they would be ok, have the better life I wasted so much time trying to give them. I gave you 12 chances. I know. Or did you? You've only given me 11 chances. It wasn't until after the first death that you promised me 12 days to get it right. Now, now, now, wait a minute. Please, give me that day. One more day. Please, I can fix this. I know I can. I'll make a deal with you. I'll give you that one more day, but... Only to set things right, not to keep living. When the day is done, so is your life. Deal? I'll take it. Merry christmas, brian. This looks... Great, jason. Well, thank you, brian. You think you could do me a little favor? Sure, I... I... I can try. - whoa, whoa, whoa, be careful. Slippery patch. Bless you, sir. Oh, please be careful. There's a slippery patch right there. Merry christmas, folks. - After you. - Thank you. Merry christmas. Good morning, mr. Conway. - It is, isn't it? This is for you. Gingerbread latte with extra cinnamon. Your favorite, yes? How did you know that? How did he know that? All that is to say that even though it may not have seemed like it, I have been listening and learning. And you were right. We should change our strategy. If we... I mean, if this company is to survive, then we have to start thinking about the future. Dale, that is why I am approving your new marketing and branding campaign. Really? But how are we gonna pay for all this? Well, I know that nina nishi's in town, and she's interested in investing. I've scheduled a meeting with her this afternoon. And something else. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your years of devotion and your hard work by giving you all a 20% raise and a month's salary as a bonus. Oh, my god. Well done. Thank you, thank you. Except for you, jet. You are getting an even bigger raise because I'm promoting you to coo. After all, you've been looking after me and this company for years, and if... If anything were to happen to me, I know pc electric would be in good hands. I won't let you down, sir. Please, call me brian. Yes, sir. I mean, brian, sir. I mean, brian. All right. You should work on that. Well, what are you all sitting there for? It's christmas eve. Get home. Start celebrating. Oh, oh, and if you're interested at all, please come to the christmas carnival tonight. Bring your families. Bring your friends. It's gonna be fun. Merry christmas. I have just a few last things I'd like you to do as my assistant, if you don't mind. - Of course not. - Ok. Now these, I want you to get to the carnival for tonight. And these, I'd like to be ordered and delivered to the house asap. I'm on it, brian. Thank you. - Papa! - Harkin. What a wonderful way to start the day. And how is my favorite sunshine sparkle unicorn? Awesome. I have a surgery scheduled today, and the nanny just called. Well, I can take care of her while you work. - Really? - Sure. I can't think of a better way to celebrate this beautiful day than to spend it with my awesome granddaughter. Great, ok. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, michelle, I can't tell you how I know this, but your patient, the one you're about to operate on, has a brain bleed that no one has noticed. What are you talking about? Just trust me. Go. Ok. I'll see you later, honey. Thank you. Ok. Bye, honey. Ok, now, how would you like to help me with a very special project? You bet I can. And that is gonna work just like that. We'll put these screws in gently. And that will fit right in there like so. - Right here. - There you go. Now put a little pressure on it. Nice job. Ok, I've got this really quick meeting, but you... you sit here for a bit. If you need anything at all, just come and get me. You're the best papa ever. I want to thank you for coming on such short notice. I know this seems out of the blue, but I've realized recently that time is precious, and I didn't want to wait. Well, I have to admit I was gonna contact you anyway. I have been following your business for a long time. I... I didn't actually ask you here to talk about business. Wait, I thought you were gonna ask me to invest. I am. But first, I want to talk a bit about life. I know what it's like to want to be successful, to want to build something that lasts. But our work, no matter how important it is, must always be in support of the life we live and never in sacrifice to it. I do want you to invest in pc electric, but only if it's part of a life you want to live and not an excuse to hide from it. You're not the person I thought you would be. I'm not the person I thought I was. Life is beautiful, right? You learn something new every day. Yeah. You were right. I ran some tests and found the bleed. And we fixed it. The surgery was a success. Oh, that's wonderful, honey. I wish you could see all the things I see when I look at you. A brave, strong, smart, kind, generous woman. I'm sorry I wasn't around for you when you were growing up, at least not the way I needed to be. None of that was your fault. You deserved better. And I am sorry it took me this long to figure it out. It's ok. You're here now. That's what matters. I heard there was free hot chocolate in the cafeteria. Is that true? And why have you been keeping this from me my entire life? Because I am a mean, horrible parent, just like my dad here. Why don't we all go get a cup? You know, I have a couple of final touches to put on the carnival for tonight. Is it ok if you two meet me there? - Of course. - Do we have to go. It's always so boring. What? What are you expecting, some sort of wild and crazy christmas extravaganza? Yes. Well, then. I guess that's just what we're gonna have to have. - He's so silly, huh? - Yeah. Ho, ho, ho! You came. I'm so happy you're here. Merry christmas. Well, the new boss. - Papa! - Oh, honey! This is the best party ever. Oh, hi. It's just getting started. I thought I would never see the day. Well, when you realize that today is the only day you have, you have to make sure it's the best possible day it can be. Ok, now I really don't know what to think. What has gotten into you? Love! And maybe a little bit of that spiked eggnog. You should try it. Honey, I think it's time you finally showed me that cartwheel. Ok. - Ta-da! - Yeah! All right, well done! Let's get this party going. Come on! Give me a ho, ho, ho! All: Ho, ho, ho! - Oh, hive me that ho! Give me that ho! Ho, ho, ho! Santa needs a cocktail. Can I get a big can of whipped cream? Hi. - Hi. Hey, listen, I have been thinking about what you said, about what I want from life. I was gonna buy your company, then break it into pieces and sell off the parts, but I don't think I want that anymore. What do you want? I want to build a life worth living. And I think pc electric would be a good place to start. I agree. And when I'm gone... When I'm retired, I know that you'll be there to look after the company. Thank you. Oh. Of course. Thank you. - Cheers. Cheers. It's good. - It's good. - It's pretty good. - Yeah. Merry christmas, brian. Merry christmas, sara. Wow! This is quite the party you've thrown. I thought you hated christmas. A man can change. How about you? Are you still that open-hearted girl I so foolishly walked out on all those years ago? Why don't you dance with me and find out? Mm. Do you remember that christmas I spent with you and your father? He and I got into a big fight, and I stormed out. Mm-hmm. Well, after you left, we had a long talk. He told me that he knew how he was too hard on you, that he always just wanted what was best for you. He told me how proud of you he was, how much he loved you. He loved you. I loved you. You didn't love yourself. I knew it. I knew you always loved me, you just never told me. You're horrible. I know. Oh. Good evening, everyone. Thanks again for coming. Just a few short words before... It's all over. Pc electric is a family business. And honestly, I'd... I'd forgotten about the family part for quite some time. You see, I was so busy trying to live up to my father's memory that I'd forgotten what really matters is making new ones. I see it now, the true meaning of christmas. Love. Love of family, love of friendship, love of humanity. After all, christmas celebrates the birth of a love so great that it just might save the world. Gosh, I... I never got that. You see, in my life, there was always one person I could never love: Myself. I didn't think I was worthy of love. But if I can't love myself, then the love I give is worthless. Not anymore. So here's my christmas wish. I wish that all of you could love yourselves as much as I love you. This has been the best day of my life. Merry christmas! Merry christmas! Why you gotta go and make me cry like that? Wow, you are just full of surprises today. Oh, I've got a few more for you too. You ready? - Yeah. Let's go. All right, keep your eyes closed. - Ok. - Eyes closed. - Where are we going? - Eyes closed. - Where are we? - Closed. Closed. Closed. - Come on. - Keep them closed. I'll say when. All right, now... - Uh-huh. Open them. I had a little help from a friend. - Dad. - Too much? Never. - all right, come on. Get on in there. Let's go. What did you do to the inside? Is it... did you also put christmas in there? Oh, wait till you see that. Here you go. Oh, boy, look at these. - Here are the cookies. - My goodness. Whoa, whoa, hey, those are for santa. Yeah. Santa and I go way back. He's not gonna mind. Now, I want you two to open these gifts. - No, it's christmas eve. We always wait until morning. New tradition. I like this new tradition. That is my dad's tool belt. That way you'll know you'll always have the tools to fix anything in life. Thank you, papa. You're welcome. Your turn. Ok. Ok. You remember that music box I gave you when you were 12? Yeah, the one I broke? The one I wouldn't fix. I wish I could go back in time and fix it like you asked me to. I wish I could go back in time and fix a lot of things in my life. But I can't, so I made you a new one. - I helped. - Yes, she did. I hope that you'll fill this one with lots of good memories. Open it. Our song. No matter what happens, I love you. I love you too. Me too. Oh, come here. Merry christmas. - Oh. Merry christmas. Now, you had better get to sleep or santa won't come. Ok. Thanks, dad, for everything. Good night, honey. See you in the morning. Merry christmas. And to all... A good night. You figured it out. I did. Took me a while. Oh, it sure did. Oh, I was running out of ways to kill you. There may not be such a thing as a good death, but at least now I can say I lived a good life. You ready to go? I am. Santa? Yes? Thanks. I'm alive. I'm alive. It's christmas day. Oh, my... It's christmas day! Ah! I'm alive! Michelle! Harkin! It's christmas morning! Wake up! - Oh, my goodness. - Let's open presents! Come on! You know, I don't know what's gotten into you, but I'm loving this new version of you. Me too. Big finish. That's terrible. This is the best christmas ever. It is, indeed. - Yeah. - Say, why don't we have a nice cup of hot cocoa? Oh. Maybe put a little irish whiskey in it. Oh, yes, incredible. Yes. - Aye. - Oh, yes, aye. Wait, there's one more present. I'll get that. That's interesting. To brian, from santa. Ok. Well, huh. Uh-huh. Told you I knew him. What is it, papa? It's a gift from an old friend. Read the card. Yeah.
