Here he comes! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, dear Dad... But why, Jean? Several months earlier... Hello Maria. Come in. Come meet the family. Follow me. - You haven't finished. - That's alright. This is my husband... Maria. - Hello, Maria. - Hello, sir. My son, Nicolas... and my daughter, Sophie. Care for some pie? No, thank you. I just ate. Then I'll show you around. Take your time, finish dessert. No dessert for me, I'm on a diet. This way. I'll show you the kitchen. Cleaning products are under the sink. Stove, microwave, washing machine. You know how it works. And here, clean dishes. Let's go see the bedrooms. We've lived here 20 years, since my mother-in-law died. My husband was born here, he's never left. At first, I didn't like the house. Too big and dark. I didn't feel at home. So Jean said, "Honey, it's your home. Decorate it". I had it repainted and moved half the furniture to the basement. My daughter Sophie's room. Don't mind the mess, it's a real artist's den. My son Nicolas' room, which he never airs out. You know how boys are. The bathroom, pee-pee room included! Last of all, our room. I didn't have time to open the shutters. Well Maria, I think that's it. Any questions? No, madam. 0K, get to work! Hello. 0h, Françoise, how are you? No! How did you catch that? Sorry to hear it. But what about tonight? Sure, I understand. We'll do it next week, when you're feeling better, 0K? Take care of yourself. Bye-bye. Darn! - Maria? - Yes, madam? Come here a minute, please. Sit down. What are you doing tonight? Nothing special. It's for me, Mom! - Hello, David. - Hello, ma'am. - I told you to call me Helen. - Sorry, Helen. - Will you be dining with us? - Yes, he will. Morals of a Monkey - I want you. - Me too. - You turn me on. - You too. - Is there time? - I don't know. You want to? - Do you? - Yeah. Dinner's almost ready. Do you know what your mom made? Yes. - What? - Roast. With what? Potatoes sautéed in parsley and garlic. - Honey, that you? - Yes. Can you help me? Be right there. Hello. What have you brought? Is it a present? Call the kids. Sophie! Nicolas! Dad has something to show you. - Hi, Dad. - Hello, Nicolas. Hi, Dad! - Hello, David. - Hello, sir. - Is it a parrot? - I hope it's not an animal! It's a snake, right? It's a surprise. Ready now, watch closely... How could you, I can't stand those beasts! 0h Mom, it's completely harmless. Right! They're full of diseases. Not at all. This is a perfectly healthy laboratory rat. Look, how cute. He's wagging his tail. I don't believe it. Don't start. I wanted an animal in the house. I fell in love with this rat. What time is it? The maid is here. The maid, at this hour? Françoise is sick, so I invited Maria. - What an idea. - Everyone to the living room. Nicolas, take that to your room. I don't want to see it again tonight. - Maria, you're beautiful! - Hello, madam. Call me Helen. This is my husband, Abdu. Good evening, Abdu. Good evening... Helen? Come in. We didn't expect you so soon. Sorry, but it's the babysitter. She costs more after 11. 0f course. Come on in. - Maria? - No, thank you. So you work in France? Yes. Abdu teaches junior-high gym. We met when I worked in the cafeteria. That's great, you work with children. Yes, I get them involved in sports. That's wonderful, and so necessary. That youthful energy must be used in healthy ways. Unfortunately our kids are no athletes. What do you mean! I took dance. That's true, dear. I always forget. I meant your brother. - Is he still in his room? - I think so. 0h, my God! Put that away immediately. It's time to eat. Coming. Be sure to wash your hands! What possessed your father... Like most African countries, Cameroon is a one-party democracy, with a president elected at 99%%! What's the President's name? Paul Biya. He's been in office about 15 years. 0verall, compared to neighboring countries, the political situation is fairly stable. Wasn't Cameroon a colony of Belgium? Not at all! 0f Germany, who lost it after WW1. It was then administered by France and England. I see. I was confusing it with Gabon. The Congo, the Belgian Congo. When did it become independent? That's complicated, because the country had become two colonies. Independence and unification happened around 1960. As it did for most African countries. Nicolas? What's wrong, aren't you hungry? I've got something important to tell you. Here goes: I'm homosexual. I'm going to my room. I'm not hungry. This isn't happening! Calm down. It's no big deal. Don't you realize, you'll never be a grandpa! Thanks a lot. I'm sorry, Sophie. And you too, David. I never doubted you. You can count on me there, madam. 'Cause when it comes to fags... Don't talk like that! Calm down. It's just an adolescent phase. But he's your son! Listen, Helen. Slow and steady wins the race. You know, Helen, maybe Abdu can do something. You know teenagers, go see him. 0h Abdu, I implore you. If you can help my son, please do. Hey, if he's a fag, he's a fag! 0K. - I'll try talking to him. - You're an angel. Thank you, Abdu. It's the first door on the right at the top of the stairs. Come in. Am I disturbing you? No, I was just thinking. Good. So, you have a rat? Yeah, my dad brought it. - What's its name? - No name yet. It's cute. 0uch! - What's wrong? - It bit me. Can I see? The little bastard. The ancient Greeks saw male love differently than we do. Really? The concept of perversion was unknown. No mention in their literature of what we call sadomasochism. They made no distinction between hetero and homosexuality because they were naturally bisexual without having defined the concept. Homosexuality was an institution, free of guilt, with its own rules and codes of behavior. In a couple, the older one was virile, active and usually bearded, while the younger one was feminine, passive and always clean-shaven. How long have you known? Since tonight at dinner. It just came to me. Have you ever had intercourse with another boy? No. Then how can you say that you're gay? I feel it. It's inside me. How about me? Do I have an effect on you? I don't know. Do you like this? Touch. I had a gay gym teacher in high school. He was no fairy. I got great grades. Even in Spain we have lots of gays. I have a very nice lesbian aunt. Her girlfriend of 10 years is quite masculine but really sweet. It's accepted today, especially in big cities. You're right, dear. I'll go talk to him. So he knows his mother hasn't left him in his time of need. You must be sure. Being homosexual isn't a casual choice. Keep quiet, he just fell asleep. - Is he feeling better? - Don't worry. - I think I solved the problem. - How so? He just needs a little exercise, it'll pass. I see. Please excuse us for this evening. Don't worry about it, it was nice. You're sweet. But Maria, please don't say anything. You know how word travels. 0f course. - See you tomorrow. - Goodnight, madam. Abdu, thanks for all you've done. It's nothing. - Goodbye, Abdu. - Goodnight, Helen. Jean? I'm still a little worried about Nicolas. That's just how you are, dear. Shouldn't I be? Mustn't count your chickens before they're hatched. You're right, dear. Goodnight. Sophie, you coming to bed? Be right there. Come on. I'm coming. Don't touch me! What's the matter? Shut your face, let me sleep! - Don't talk to me like that. - I'll talk to you like a dog. Several months later... - Things are much better. - Yes? We were very afraid for Sophie. Luckily she's strong, and her will to live triumphed. We were so relieved she awoke from the coma, that her paraplegia wasn't so hard to accept. 0f course, she'll never be the same. But she's still with us, that's what counts. And Nicolas? He's doing great. He's involved in sports, and he loves it. He used to be so reserved. Now he's outgoing and extroverted. It's good that he's taking care of his body. His studies always came first before. In fact, all this is thanks to Abdu. You know, my maid's black husband. He's been very devoted to him. How has your husband reacted to all these events? Very well. He's always been the opposite of me, I'm such a worrywart. He takes it all in stride. Sometimes I do wish he would get more involved... But that's not his nature! - 0h, it's you. - Yes! The rat escaped! No, it's his exercise time. At least he should get to stretch his legs. Put that rat away now! Can't the shrink cure your mouse phobia? It's a rat! Maria, did you clean the kitchen? I didn't have time. Why am I paying you? You don't even clean! - Fuck off! - Maria, your language! I've got Sophie to look after. Get a nurse if you're not happy. I hope I mean more than the kitchen. You could at least dust. You're wearing me out. You don't want me to die, at least let me suffer! Fine. I'm going to Hips and Thighs class with Françoise. - It's you. - How're you? Swell. Back from sports? No, I skipped to go shopping. I got lots of cool stuff! I'll show you later. I'm going to my room. How's it going? - Take me to my room. - Hang on a second. - Hi, David. - Hi, Maria. - She isn't too heavy? - No. 'Cause she never eats anymore. - Hello. - Can I help you? - It's about the ad... - What ad? For the group session. 0h right! Excuse me, I forgot. Hello. For the ad? Come in. It's this way. - Hello, miss. - Hello, sir. - The group session? - Yes. Come in. Upstairs, first room on the right. Thank you. Shall I take your briefcase? No thanks, I'll be needing it later. Who is it? It's the doctor. Come in. Have you been a good doggy? Good boy, you brought mommy a bone. You'll get your reward. I feel nothing. We should try the tits. No, I've had it. Had it with what? Had it with all these games. You don't desire me anymore? 0f course I do, but not this way. My wheelchair turns you off. You're not funny. Want me to whip you while you lick me? I was looking for something. What's this? It's nice. - What's this? - It's nothing. But you're bleeding! We need to disinfect it. Come on! You're so sweet. I need affection. I've got something for you. A Spanish specialty. - Who's there? - The neighbor boy. Come in, Gregory. Sorry, but he needs love. You give him pain. Isn't Abdu enough? It's just a game. I've got a game too. What game? Anonymous photos and letters, blackmail... That's horrible! Just a game. Give us the photo. No way! I forgot my keys. There they are. - What is it now, Maria? - 0h, nothing. You disgust me. I don't even feel like hitting you. I beg you, punish me! You don't deserve it. Beat it. But I love you. You're repeating yourself. Want to try something else? - Answer me. - Let me think. - I could hurt you too. - Go ahead if it turns you on! - David, what's going on? - I'm alright. What did she do to you now? I said I'm alright. Are you sure? There, there, what happened? She doesn't love me. She doesn't love me anymore. Yes, she does. But the accident's been hard on her. Try to understand. Don't touch me! It's your fault. Hey asshole, you said you needed affection! Please Maria, can't you see David is upset? So? I may be the maid but I won't take this abuse. It doesn't matter. I better go. You sure you're alright? I'm alright. You won't do anything foolish? I promise. Go home, then. Goodbye. Tell me, Maria, was he injured or was I hallucinating? 0h, it was just a scratch. - Do you think that Sophie... - It's possible. - Stay, Gregory. - No, you're a bunch of cheaters! - Who is it? - Me, Sophie. What? Can I come in? No, we've got too many already. C'mon. I need to try new things. I'll ask the others. Hi Abdu, how are you? Fine. Is Maria here? She just left for her class... - African Dance? - That's it. 0h well. I'll be going then. - 0K, bye-bye. - Bye. Do you have time for tea? Here. You know, in Nicolas' case, I'm not sure sports are enough. It's just a start, we should delve deeper. But even so, this change is so sudden. You still have that creature? Don't remind me! My husband's crazy about it. We can't get rid of it. Still no name? How can you name a rat? Excuse me, Abdu. Ah, Françoise, feeling better? I'm glad to hear it. No, I haven't spoken to Sophie yet. She's so hard to talk to anymore. - Hello. - Just a minute. Hello. - Are you a friend of Nicolas'? - Yeah. Where's the kitchen, please? Down the hall, to the left. Thanks, ma'am. Sorry Françoise, it was one of Nicolas' friends. He seems charming. I don't know. There are a few of them. No, Nicolas is doing better. Still involved in sports. We'll talk later. I can't say right now. What? Yes. Yes, it's possible. Listen, I can't talk, I'm busy. I'll call you back. Bye. Sorry, it was my friend. Helen, what you said about Nicolas worries me. I think I should go see him. Is he in his room? Yes, with some friends. Great, thank you. - Who's there? - Me, Abdu. Hey! Come in, Ab-darling. I didn't mean to disturb you. I just wondered if you needed anything? No thanks, Mom. Well, have a good game. Thanks, ma'am. Pass a zucchini. 25 red, odd... - Who won that zucchini? - Me. - Sweetie, we should talk. - What about? About what's been going on. Since your accident. I told you it wasn't an accident! It was a choice. The accident is that I'm still alive. Please don't say that. It's the truth. You and David seem to be having some problems. - It's over. - 0ver? He can't get me off anymore. You know the Doctor said you may never... I don't care! I have other erogenous zones. You're too hard on David. He's a sweet, sensitive boy. Not many would have stayed with a paraplegic. If you like him so much, go screw the bastard! Maria tried, now it's your turn! Don't be silly, she just massaged him. Nice massage! My God! Isn't zucchini good with olive oil? I love it. And you, Jean? It's edible. You didn't ask me. I already know you like it, dear. - Sophie? - What? Talked to Nicolas lately? Yeah, why? He worries me. He's stopped confiding in me. He's going astray. - Nicolas has changed... - Nicolas is all you can say! Aren't you worried about me? We talked about David earlier... 0nly your dear son matters! You don't care about me. You never have. I love you both the same. You always say that. To convince yourself. It means nothing! 0f course it does. I've never distinguished between you. We treat you the same. 0h, big words now. You disgust me. There, there, dear. I love you as much as Nicolas. Father does too. My father... the faggot! Watch your mouth, Sophie! You seem to enjoy degrading us. You know your father isn't a homosexual. You're living proof. Just because he touched you twice, briefly. Shut up! You're filled with poison! It's the poison of truth! Honey, we've got to talk. You've probably noticed the kids aren't doing too well. Youth must sow its wild oats. Yes, but does that include being a homosexual and a practicing sadomasochist? Lt'll pass. You think it's normal that your son left school to have in-home orgies? Listen dear, you're over-tired. Get some sleep. Tomorrow is another day. Don't patronize me, I'm not ill! Yelling won't help. Goodnight. Night brings light. I'm sick of your stupid proverbs. You should stop philosophizing and take action. And take care of your kids! I'm no longer involved in their upbringing. They're free adults. You never were involved. You're nothing but... a rat! Communication, love, affection... Communication, love, affection... Who's there? Mom, what are you doing here? I've decided to take action. I want to help you find a cure. A cure for what? This unhappy homosexuality. But I'm not unhappy! Nicolas, be honest, how do I look? Am I still pretty and desirable, for my age? Mom, are you drunk? No, I'm me. For the very first time! If we had started before, none of this would have happened. What are you doing? Giving love to my son. How does your dream end? I gently put him at ease, he relaxed, and I soon noticed that I had aroused him. Yes... He lay on top of me, and entered me. At first it was a little strange. Then, little by little, I forgot he was my son. I let myself go... and it became very enjoyable. I kept saying to myself, "You must make him come, you must make him come". And? And he came. - And you? - No. But he was the important one. I felt if I succeeded, he'd be over it. 0ver your love? No, over his homosexuality. Is it bad? It's just a dream. Expressing it subconsciously is better than acting out. That's just it. There's a problem. Yes? It wasn't a dream. Now what, Maria? You've changed hairstyles again. It's all over, all over! What? Abdu's been fired, he's unemployed. But why? Because of the photo... What photo? Sophie's photo of David and me, she sent it to him. What's that to do with his job? He showed it to a student, and the boy's parents filed a complaint for molestation. What a strange thing to happen. Anyway, Abdu isn't attracted to boys. Yes, he is. Abdu is homosexual? Yeah, since recently. Him, too! Men are such hypocritical cowards. The real problem is he's lost his job. Maria, what about being married to a homosexual? That's 0K with me. Men have disappointed me. I think I have a lesbian side, like my aunt. It runs in the family. Are you shocked? No, no. We're all running low on love. Affection is always welcome, no matter what the source. - Careful of my eyes! - Trust your little brother. - How was it with mom? - Wonderful. - She's not a bad lay? - She's actually pretty good. Isn't her body shriveled up? No, she's well-preserved for her age. Anyway, we also talked a lot. About her, about me. It was intense. Didn't your dick size disappoint her? You always have to spoil everything. In any case, it didn't agree with her. She looks like a zombie. It's not easy for her right now. Her world is collapsing. But I think it'll be good for her. She'll realize she's wasted her life. - You mean dad? - Among other things. - Should I try him? - Who? - Dad. - Why not. Rinse cycle. - That's too hot! - Wait. Hey, Dad. Hello, son. Wanna see my new stuff? If you like. I got some wild things! There's a sale at Gaultier's. They're giving it away! Check this out! Very colorful. It's last season's, but I love the stretch fabric. It clings to the curves. Ah, I love this one. I found it at a thrift shop. Guess how much? I don't know. 60 francs? No way! 12 francs. Cool, huh? - Nicolas? - Yes? Remember one thing. - What? - Clothes don't make the man. Dad, do you love me? 0f course. Like every father loves his son. You seem ashamed of me. Maybe I'm not the son you wanted. You're disappointed. Actually... no. I'm not disappointed. I accept you as you are, though we are different. What are you reading? Some very interesting medical documents on turn-of-the-century malformations. Do you think I've changed much since my accident? I haven't noticed anything in particular. Aside from your handicap. You know about mom and Nicolas? Yes, of course. What do you think? I don't think incest will solve the problems of western civilization, but your mother is an exceptional woman. You know, I can be exceptional too. That's nice, dear. Tell me, how do you rate me: Very pretty, fairly pretty or not pretty? Better one truth than two lies. In fact... I don't think you're pretty at all. I see. Come in. Hi. How's it going? Rolling along. I brought you flowers. Nice of you to remember my funeral. What do you want? I miss you, Sophie. I can't live without you. You're always on my mind. I wonder if we could get back together. Do you know how much you hurt me, David? You can't just come back. Maybe it's not me you miss, but Maria. You know Maria means nothing to me. I've always loved you. Will you take me back? I've stopped loving you, David. Is there someone else? Maybe. I brought you all together because things can't go on this way. We must do something. - Honey, are you listening? - 0f course. We need to talk, clarify some things, and bring our family back together. So I've decided that we should all go to a 4-day group therapy session being held out in the country. What do you think? Dear, I think it's a great idea for you, but personally I don't think I need it. But you must come, as a member of the family. I'm sure you'll do fine without me. I'm going to do my crossword. Mom... I'll be happy to come. Thank you, dear. You're my angel. And you, Sophie? I agree to go. Thanks, sweetheart. Happy birthday to you... But why, Jean? - Hello? - Hi, dear. It's me. You woke me. Sorry, but it's important. We figured out what's been wrong, it's the rat. He puts bad vibes on us. We must get rid of him. Yes, yes. You'll take care of it? Count on me. I love you so much! - 0K, goodnight. - See you tomorrow, my love. Mom, could you hold the door? Honey, it's us! Dad, we're home. Where are you? Where is he? He must still be in bed. Honey? Honey, we're back. Help! What's happening? Answer me! Mom! Come in. What's the matter? Something's wrong. Sophie, hurry up! I've got him! We did it! We killed him. To my Dear Husband To our Beloved Father Time passes. Memories live on Here she is. It's for you. - Who is it? - Françoise. Hi Françoise. Yes, but we waited for you. What? No! How did you catch that? My poor dear. Thanks for calling, anyway. Take care of yourself. Bye. Poor Françoise, she has no luck. Well, I feel like something to drink. Let's go to the nearest café. There's one there. Can you manage, honey? Subtitles: Sionann 0'Neill Subtitling by TVS - TITRA FILM
