I need a ladder on the back, as well as any hot spots, okay? Here's your water. Let's go, fellas. Let's go! Oh, man, you didn't have to be here tonight. It's okay, Chief. - Sure? - I'm good. Stay close, will you? Make sure he doesn't do anything reckless. - Yes, sir. - Let's go, men! - Let's get that van rolling. - It's leaking out. Let's take it in and get a good knockdown. All right. Come on, Tom. No place else I'd rather be. - What's the matter with you, man? - What? Tiffany's back in the hospital. Cancer. Ma'am. No! My daughter's inside! My daughter's inside! There's a girl inside! Chief, I have point. You want to do that, bud? Let's do it. All right, let's do it. Please! My best man's in there looking for her right now. I found a way in. David, you with me? Always, brother. Ma'am, it's gonna be all right. Come on, ma'am. First floor is clear. We're going upstairs. Find the girl and get the heck out of there! Push the backdraft, Tom. Don't get reckless. It's getting real hot in there, Chief. You've got to pull them out of there, Chief. - Oh, no! No! - Chief! Look at it up there, man! Just hold fast. Chief, if you're not going to pull them out, then at least let Devon and me in, too. - Yeah. - We got her. Yeah. - We're coming out. - He's coming out. ♪ We've no less days ♪ To sing God's praise ♪ Than when we first begun ♪ It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Today, I would like to speak to you from the book of Ecclesiastes. Ecclesiastes 3, verses 1 through 8. We'll be starting this week our nine-week sermon series called "There is a season." "A time to be born "and a time to die, "a time to plant "and a time to uproot, "a time to kill "and a time to heal, "a time to tear down "and a time to build, "a time to weep..." Well, you know the rest. And you do not want me to sing that song, I promise you. Today's sermon is going to focus on suffering. Pain. And the healing love of God's miracles. Where? Uh, where what, friend? Where are these miracles? When will he come down from his golden throne and touch the people? I'm sorry? You sing songs, give money, time, blood, sweat and tears. You talk about faith and being faithful. But when it comes down to our absolute desperate needs, where is the Almighty to actually help the people? Where is the King? I know there are questions, - but... - You have no idea. He's not just a king. You know, he's also a suffering servant. He's a God that knows our pain and is acquainted with our grief. Then what can I even hope for? Faith gives substance to what you hope for. I'm all out of faith. You have to believe. You have to believe with all of your heart. There can be no doubt. Doubt is the yeast that spoils the whole loaf. Believe that! Come on, get this guy out of here. Tom, don't let her get too close to the geese. Back up. There you go. The parade starts in an hour. Let's go. Come on, shorty, let's go to the parade. Tiffany, look, who is it? It's one of Daddy's work trucks. That's right, it's one of Daddy's fire trucks. Say, "Hi, Mr. Steve. Hi, Mr. Devon." You remember Donnie Piper? Stop, I still feel bad about that. You know, that was so mean of you, but if it wasn't for Donnie Piper, we wouldn't be together. Who's Donnie Piper? Don't. - David? - Okay, okay. So, Tom and me were watching this very parade. We were 14 years old, but it's 20 years ago, right? - Eighteen years ago. - Eighteen years ago. So, there's this guy, Donnie Piper. He's been picking on Sarah in school. He kept calling me "church girl," making fun of Christians, that sort of thing. I can totally handle it, but here comes Mr. Muscles and his best friend David. So, we catch up to Donnie in the alley and we pie him. You what? Well, you know, Tom, he's got a whipped cream pie, he sticks it, "boom," right in his face. So, here is Donnie, he's trying to wipe pie off of his face, I come running around the corner, "bang," I stick another pie in his face. So, now Tom, he grabs him, he throws him into the middle of the parade, and he yells, "Hey, look, it's the Pied Piper!" Oh, you two are terrible. We were. We were. It's true. So, that's when you fell in love with him? Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no. So, a couple of days later, I'm coming home from school, I cut through the lot. There is Donnie, but he's got his big brother with him. Starts roughing me up a little bit, gives me a black eye. So now, I go to see Tom, Tom sees me with a black eye, and Tom says... - "Well, I'll get him." - Yeah. So, now, Tom, he's going all around the neighborhood, he's looking for Donnie's big brother, right? So, did you find him? I did. He gave me a black eye, too. So, here he is, sitting in the grass, crying. I was not crying. He looked so pathetic. He had no one but his best friend sitting next to him. And that, that is when she stole my best friend. That's when I fell in love with him. Firefighter stuff is just a stepping stone. I figure it's just a matter of time before I get picked for one of those hottest firefighter calendars. And then, off to the races, baby. But, hey, you know, it pays the bills, right? California, that's where you want to be. You know, I bet, as firemen, we would totally outrank everybody on beach patrol. I mean, can you imagine if they let me walk around all day with my shirt off? Man, it would cause a riot. Hey, will you excuse me, Steve? Okay, sure. So, Kevin, he meets this girl, right? Real California type... Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year! Come on, let's go, bath time. Sarah? Well, I'm going to do some blood tests, I'm going to get a CT done. And if I need to, a follow-up MRI. We'll just hold her in observation for right now. Let her relax, get some fluids in her and we'll go from there, okay? Why does Mommy keep getting sick? I don't know. Will she be better soon? We're going to keep praying for that every day. Do you have any questions, Mr. Hatcher? Mr. Hatcher? Uh... The treatment is aggressive, but at this stage... Her doctor said it was just migraines. The hospital has counselors on hand. And there are also some wonderful cancer support groups, too. I'll do everything I can to help her, Mr. Hatcher, including pray for her. I thought doctors weren't supposed to talk about religion. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a follower of Christ. Tom. What is it, babe? Can you feel him? Feel who? God. His love. Can you feel it? - Sarah, I love you so... - Mommy? Hi, honey. Mommy, can we... Mommy? Sarah! Sarah, no! Doctor, nurse, please! We need help here! She's not responding! All move to Bay A! Come on, people, move! - Come on, please! - Sir, I need you to move, please. Get her away from here, okay? Thank you. Thank you. I need lights! Sarah! This kid named Josh threw red paint all over. Mrs. Smith was mad. Josh's mom had to come pick him up. - You like your teacher? - She's nice. Good. Dad? Yes? How come we don't go to church? I don't know. Uncle David and his family go to church. They go to a synagogue. What's that? Well, it's similar. Can we can go to a synagogue? No, we're... Well, we're not Jewish. Did you and Mommy get married in a church? Yeah. The one we used to go to when Mommy was alive. That's the one. I liked it there. You remember it? At the church? A little. I was small. Yeah. That was two years ago. I miss Mommy. She made good food. Yeah, me, too. Eat your dinner. - Dad? - Yeah? Sometimes I can't remember what Mommy looked like. Tiff. Tiff? Dad. You made bail, Tom. - What's he doing here? - He's the one that bailed you out. Where is David? You guys got another call this morning. I guess it's been a busy weekend for you. Can I give you a lift? My friend will be here as soon as the fire is out. Well, that could be hours, and I'm here now. Just a ride. Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Dan Underwood. Tom Hatcher. Listen, Tom... Is it okay if I call you Tom? Despite our encounter today, I'm here if you need someone to talk to. In case you need to vent in a nonviolent way. I'm not looking for a new friend. Maybe I am. Thank you for the lift, and for bailing me out. Psst. Daddy! Good morning. You were snoring. Loud. How are you feeling? I want to go home. I know. I want that, too. We have to wait and see what Dr. Robinson says. He never says yes. Well, you know, it hasn't reduced in size, but, you know, it hasn't grown either. Is that good? Bad? Or what? It's good, but normally, I like to see a reduction in mass. You know, however, it does give us some hope. So, how are you doing? I'm tired. Physically. Mentally. Northville fighters, let's move! Excuse me. My daughter? They took her for her treatment. Room 22-C. Thanks. It'll be over before you know it. Can you be a brave girl for me? Okay. Perfect. I'll be back to check on you in about 30 minutes. Hey, bug, how you doing? I want to go home, Daddy. I know, I know. Soon, okay? Hey, what kind of colors you got here? Can I help you color? Tiffany? Tiffany, honey, come be with Mama. Come on, honey, you'll love it here. Come on, I'll give you a giant hug. Come on, honey. I love you so much! Sarah, no! Hold, please! - What floor? - Uh, three. - Have a good day. - You, too. Hey, bug. What did I do now? How come you didn't sleep over? I had to go home and shower and change my clothes. You don't want everyone to think your dad stinks, do you? I don't care. I can leave if you want. No, stay. Did the doctor come in and see you? Just a nurse. Was it the mean one or the nice one? Dad. Because if it was the mean one, I'll knock her to the moon. How are we feeling today? I want to go home. Well, as a matter of fact, that is exactly why I'm here. - You mean... - Friday. - Yay! - But she'll have to remain an outpatient for treatments, but, uh, no more radiation. That's good news. Will my hair grow back? - You'll have curls in no time. - Yay! All right, but I'll tell you something, you can't go back to school right away. You know, her immune system is still pretty fragile, and she needs to stay healthy while she's in treatment. But I see no reason to keep her here. Besides, there's nothing like familiar surroundings to promote healing. You'll be back in school before you know it. Yay. So, that's it for me. If you have any questions, just ask. Okay. - Thank you, Dr. Robinson. - All right. You're welcome. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Good news, huh? In the meantime, you, little girl, - need to take a nap. - Okay. Good. There you go. Hi. What are you reading? It's a World War II love story. Silly, I know, but I love the era, back when men were men and women allowed them to be. And you bring your own flowers, too. I love the smell of them. Smells like lavender. Lavender? Yeah, mountain fresh fabric softener. I think. So, instead of fabric softener reminding you of nature, nature reminds you of laundry. Yeah, I guess. I'm Tom, Tom Hatcher. You a cop, Tom? Even when you guys are out of uniform, I can always tell. Well, you're way off. Am I? I'm a fireman. Ah, yes. Way off. I'm Melissa, Melissa Nolan. Do you mind? I'm sorry. No, I'd like to sit down. Oh, yeah. Duh. You work here, then? No. No, I like pretending. On Tuesdays, I'm an astronaut. I don't know if I could work here every day. - Place makes me feel... - Sick? Isolated. I'm sorry. It's been a long time since I've tried something like this. This? And for what... I don't even know... For what it's worth, you seem like a really nice person. I've got to go. Now, you all know, my brother-in-law passed. I told my sister, I said, "You're family. "You're coming here, ain't no two ways about that." Right. It's the Christian thing to do, and I'd do it again. But y'all have been to my house, man. You know, I got three bedrooms, if you count that little one, and it's seven people living there. Where did we put those donuts? Now, last week I came home, after sitting here for three days. Three days, man! All I want is something nice to eat, remote control, a little peace and quiet. What do you think I had for dinner? I think you had all the donuts, 'cause there were two dozen when I came in this morning. Bowl of cereal. Hmm? Now, Carla made that roast. Man, you know I like that roast. Potatoes, carrots, onions, the whole nine. I open up the slow cooker when I get home, and those boys, them picked it dry, man! Now, I love those boys, but we are gonna have to have a serious conversation about who the alpha member of this family is. Because a man can't work all week and come home to a bowl of cereal! It just ain't right! Man, it's like a sitcom over there or something. I ought to pitch that to a network television. Yeah, and you should let me play you. And why should you play me? 'Cause I'm handsome. Here we go, boys! Mind if I join you? Only if you promise to stay. So, I got tired of filing insurance claims and went back to school. At least with nursing I know I'm making a difference. That's what it's all about. What about you? I'd rather hear more about you. Come on. You have a great job. I mean, who doesn't want to be a fireman? Later, okay? Sometimes, it's nice just to listen. Okay, well, um, I'm from Grand Rapids. My father was an economics professor at Grand Valley, and my mother was an artist. Oh, like a painter? No, folk art. Like, Grandma Moses type stuff, wooden trinkets and quilts. To be honest, we didn't really get along once I got older. Sounds like my relationship with my father. She was a good mother. Just didn't really have a lot in common with her. I mean, I guess nobody does, but... I met a girl once. I had a lot in common with her. It must be really tough. Not a day goes by I don't think of her. And on the rare occasion that I do... I feel guilty. How long ago did she... Two years. Wow. It's been two years already. Oh, um, your daughter's been sent to out processing. She should be ready in about an hour. - Okay, thanks. - Yeah. What's on your mind, bug? - I bet the baby ducks are big. - I bet they are. Can we go see them? No, honey, you're supposed to stay inside, remember? But, Dad... Thems are the rules. How about we play a game? No, I don't want to play a game. How about we build a fort? - Can we build it in the living room? - Of course we can. I'll go get some sheets and blankets. I'm coming, too. Can I have a bite of yours? You got the wrong one. Nuh-uh. Mine is way better. Let me see. Are you kidding? Mine's way better. - Where'd you get that? - Your room. It's Mommy's. Yeah, I know. Did she read it? Mommy read a lot of books. Can we read it? Well, it's a bunch of different stories, honey. It's not just one. Can we read them all? Pick one. That one. Which one? Where my finger is. - "How Sam Hart Beat the Devil"? - Yeah. You got it, kid. "While taking in the air on his doorstep "on a summer evening, "he was visited by a bland and dignified stranger." Daddy? Yes? Why was Sam Hart afraid? Why do you think he was afraid? Because he was scared he'd lose his horse. It was a nice horse. Can I have a horse? Hmm, we'll see. Okay? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Don't you look pretty. - Thank you. Good morning. Welcome. Daddy, look. Let's sit here. They saved us a spot. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Good morning, friends. Won't you please join Lisa for a song? ♪ O Lord, my God ♪ When I in awesome wonder... ♪ That's the guy who punched the pastor. Back row, center. Okay, but let's be discreet. ♪ I see the stars ♪ I hear the rolling thunder ♪ Thy power throughout... ♪ Can you come with me, please? I'll be right back, Tiff, okay? ♪ Then sings my soul ♪ My Savior God... ♪ Yes? I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're kidding, right? You're serious? Hey, hey, where do you think you're going? To get my daughter. - Tiff, we have to go. - What? Why? Come on, let's go. It just started! ♪ How great Thou art ♪ This man says we have to leave. Why? It's not fair. No, it's not. - I'm sorry. - Too late. It's okay, bug. We'll go to a different church, okay? No, I don't want to go to a different church. I want to go to the one where you and Mommy got married. - We can't. - Why? Because I'm sick? No. No. It has nothing to do with you. It's not your fault. Then why? We'll find a different church. I promise. Don't get too carried away. Hello. Hello yourself. Hi. I hope you don't mind. I got your number from Records. Isn't that illegal? Unethical, yes. Not sure about the legality, though. I heard that Tiffany was released today. That's great news. She's still an outpatient, though. Maybe we could do lunch? Uh... I'd like that. Do you want my number? Caller ID. Duh. Um... Well, I'm going to get back to work, and I was just calling to say hi. Bye. Bye. Was that the fireman? Not that it's any of your business, but, yes. Okay. Anybody seen Tom today? It's a drill day, Chief. Cut the guy a break. Get a haircut, David. I'm not going to tell you again. Yes, sir. Steve, how you feeling? Great. It's 80 degrees out, and I'm in full gear climbing a ladder. I didn't want to go to the beach or the pool or anything today. I wanted to be hauling a hundred pounds of gear up this ladder. Thanks. Yeah, maybe firefighting is not the job for you. Aw, come on now, Chief. You know I'm your favorite. Rodriguez, you're up! Get up that ladder! Move! - Hello. - Hey. What happened to, "I'll call you when I'm down there"? I forgot. You know, with everything going on with Tiffany, I just... It was just lunch, Tom. It's okay. Really. - I feel really bad. - Don't. How about we do dinner instead? Tomorrow, around 7:00? Well, it's the least you could do. Great. - I'll call you. - Okay. - Hello. - Hi. Hey, bug. She did great. I knew she would. Who was that lady? Just a nurse. She's pretty. You should marry her. "Marry her"? Bug, where did you get that idea? Mommy told me. I saw the light on, so I thought maybe I could... How are you? Fine. May I come in? Sure. Thank you. Can I get you a beer? Soda? Okay. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. So, I understand you stopped by the church on Sunday. Yeah. Just a personal observation. You have a lot of work to do with hospitality. Yeah, that was wrong. And I apologize. That's all my fault. Daddy? Come on in, bug. Hey, how are you doing? Hi. Who's that? He's the pastor at the church. - Can I show him Froggy? - Yeah, go ahead. His name is Froggy, and he likes to lick people. That's very cute. What is your name? You can tell him. Tiffany. Tiffany. That's a beautiful name. And how old are you, Tiffany? You can tell him. Seven. Seven, wow. Hey, you want some chocolate milk? Really? Just a small cup. She's a cute kid. Yeah, well, she has cancer. And your thugs kicked her out of your church, and she cried all day on Sunday. - And I... - Just a small cup, Tiffany. - Look, I'm really sorry... - Dan, I appreciate you stopping by, but I'm not coming back. Tom, I'd like a second chance. Try to make things right. We all do. - Life is nothing but... - Good night, Dan. ...second chances. God help him. Help me. I see you boys wondering, "What does old Steve have?" Well, he might have a pair of twos, but then again, you never know with old Steve. Tom, your mother-in-law just called from the hospital. She had to take Tiffany back there. Don't worry about your shift. Get on over there. - God bless you, buddy. - Don't worry about us. We've got your back, bro. - We got you, man. - We're here for you, buddy. See you, Tom. All right, well, I guess I'll get... Get out of here, too, then. No. You're not going anywhere. In fact, I need you on bathroom duty. Now. Looks like old Steve has a royal flush! Clean that toilet nice, Steve. I'll be in there in a minute. Mr. Hatcher. Look, I'm sorry about the wait. This is merely precautionary. Can we get you anything? No thanks. Any ideas? Uh, not yet. Her CT scans get back this afternoon, so in the meantime, I'm just going to let her rest, and let you rest. Don't worry, we're going to take good care of her. Thanks. This has to be the worst coffee in the history of fire departments. How's Tiff doing? Hospital again. Anything I can do? Unless you got a cure for cancer. I wish I did. I really do. You know, we all love you, Tom. Really, we do. But City Hall is getting kind of antsy about when they're gonna start getting return on their investment, you know, bang for the buck. You're kidding, right? You've had a rough patch. But City Hall, they really don't care. And I just wanted to give you a heads up, so you're not caught with your pants down. I have vacation and personal days. You used them all up. Chief, I got vacation time. He can have it. And if that doesn't cover it, I'll take his hours. I'll work, you put Tom's name in the books. I got personal days. You can have them, Tom. Me, too, Chief. I have time, you can use mine. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Steve, garbage. May I get you something to drink? An ice tea would be wonderful. - Very good. - Thank you. Well, we could keep heading north - and end up in Chicago two days early. - Mm-hmm. Or we could take a left and spend a few days in Memphis. What's in Memphis? Nothing but the home of the king of rock 'n' roll, baby. Elvis, you hunk, a hunk of burnin' love. I'm all shook up, baby. - Let's go. - Really? Yeah. Let's do it. Let's do everything. Always. - I love you, baby. - I love you, too, king. Can I get you another one, hon? Yeah. - Another ice tea? - Um... - Just the check, please. - Of course. What is the shortest verse in the Bible? "And Jesus wept." So, what does that... What does that tell us? Sorry, one second. I have to take this. Hello. Yeah. Yes. I could do that, definitely. Okay, I'll be there in about 20 minutes. Okay. Sorry, duty calls. Um, would you mind leading the rest of the Bible study? - Not a problem, absolutely. - Thank you. - Everything okay? - Yup, - I just have to take off right now. - Okay. - Um, thank you all, see you next week. - Be careful, please. Rough week? Well, aren't you a big hunk of a man? Can I get you something? Nothing. Thanks, I'm fine. - How about you? - He's done. I'm all set. Okay. I know this isn't exactly your job description. No, it's right up my alley. Excuse me. You're gonna be sick? I'm fine. Just in case, take this bag. Thanks. I'm not a bad person, you know. I know that. Then tell me, why do I feel so bad? Life goes on, Tom. Is that what God says? Actually, it's Lennon and McCartney. Or Robert Frost. Take your choice. Your wife, what was her name? Sarah. And she was beautiful, inside and out. It won't always be this way. You don't understand. No one really does. Tom, let me help you. You could have called anyone to come pick you up, anybody from the firehouse, but you called me. - Talk to me. - You can't help. I'm not God. I don't even claim to be a good person, but I try. Let me try and help you. Thanks for the ride, Dan. Hey, Tom, it's Melissa. If you're on your way to the restaurant, just forget it. I'm leaving. I'm not mad. I just... I just hope everything's okay. Goodbye. Hi, Dan. Thought you could use a good cup. Thanks. It's a little early, isn't it? It's a beautiful morning. Need a ride to your car? Oh. Yeah. I forgot about that. - All right. Thanks. - Sure. I just need to take care of some things real quick. Come on. Big fan of spinach? I hate it. The spinach reminds me, "I yam what I yam." And this sculpture, the sculpture reminds me that God is the redeemer of broken things. In him, all things are made new. It's called "born again." All right, just one more thing before we go. And, Lord, I just wanna thank you for... Well, you know. You're good, and I need you, every day. They meet once a week, praying for each other and over requests for prayers. Amen. - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you for being faithful. God has been working on my heart lately, like he often does. God wants to be an active part of our life, but he doesn't force himself upon us. The Bible says that Jesus stands at the door and knocks. He's waiting for us to open the door and invite him in. We are weak. He is strong. When we let him in, we allow ourselves to depend on him. His power is made perfect in our weakness. What do you want from me? My wife died two years ago. It was sudden. We barely had time to say goodbye. Everything happened so quickly. One minute we were in college, then married with a kid. It was my idea to become a fireman. I was away three or four days a week. She would have gotten cancer either way, Tom. It makes no difference where you worked. I don't know. With the baby and getting the house together and me always gone. Maybe if I had been around more and we moved slower, we could have caught it earlier. It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault. It's life. Tiffany has renal cell carcinoma. It's rare with children, but there you have it. Our lives are like flowerbeds. Most just see the colors, but when you get in real close, you realize we're all just sitting in manure. I don't know about you, Dan Underwood. Hi, I was looking for my daughter. Mr. Hatcher, we've been trying to get a hold of you. I don't have any messages. Did you call Mr. Hatcher's cell number? No, I called his house. I left a message. That's why you have my cell. We had to move Tiffany to ICU. She had a seizure this morning. Mr. Hatcher? Mr. Hatcher? Mr. Hatcher, are you okay? Feeling better? What's this? Tylenol. Take it easy. Tiffany is not going anywhere. How is she? Well, why don't we make sure that you're all right first, Tom? You always call me Mr. Hatcher, but never Tom. Would you like me to go back to calling you Mr. Hatcher? It's okay. It's not very comforting, but it's okay. So, how is she? Well... Craig, tell me how my daughter is. Cancer has moved into her lymph nodes, and we're gonna have a meeting to discuss treatment. - But you said the tumor hadn't grown. - It hasn't, but the cancer has spread. So, what does this mean? We'll know more soon. Daddy's here, Tiff. What do you want me to do? I'll do anything. Just tell me. Please. - Hey. - What time is it? You need to get some rest. I'll be all right. - Sleeping pills? - Yeah. Why don't you just go home, take a shower, eat something, take the pills and get some rest? We'll take care of her. Maybe a shower, but no pills. At least, get something to eat. Oh, uh... Hospital has showers here if you wanna use it, but I still recommend going home to get some rest. Okay. Thanks. Hey, baby. How you feeling? Will you sing me a song? Sure. Anything special? One of Grandpa's silly songs. Okay, I'll try. ♪ Up and down ♪ Monkey on my head ♪ Swinging on my ears ♪ His name is Fred ♪ She was awake. She laughed. Can we talk? Tom... How long? It's not long. I'm sorry. Hey, Daddy. You okay, bug? You want anything? How is she feeling? Are they making her comfortable? She's a little groggy because of the meds, but they're doing a fine job at the hospital. Did Sarah have her own cookbook? If there were any meals that Tiffany liked, I could try to make them for her. Thank you, that's very nice of you. She made a special mac and cheese. I don't really remember how she made it, but I can look around for the recipe. So, I've been talking to a pastor. Dan Underwood from the church where Sarah and I used to go. He helping you at all? He can't help. Doctors can't help. What does God want from me, David? I don't know. My parents really loved your family. I ever tell you that? They always respected your parents' devotion to their faith. You know, when my parents died, there was this... This just hole in my heart. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I'm not talking about my parents, David! Parents are supposed to die! Grandparents are supposed to die! My wife was not supposed to die! My daughter... My daughter, David. Hey, there's my little munchkin. Hey, monkey, how are you? Hi, Uncle David. - Wanna play Go Fish? - You bet I do. - And you know what? - What? This time, I'm gonna deal. And do you know why? - Why? - 'Cause you cheat. - No, I don't. - You do. Can I give you a kiss on the forehead first? Ready? All right, card time. Who else is in? - Me. - Dad? - I'll play, sure. - Go Fish, that's right. She looked really good today. She's a trooper. Just like her mom. We'll come back in the morning, okay? We'll bring you a change of clothes. Thanks. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi, Tom. I left you at a restaurant. - I don't know... - It's okay. I understand. No, it's not. I should have at least called. How's Tiffany? We're preparing. I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry. - Thanks. Tiffany? Sarah, where's Tiffany? Hello? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Can somebody help me, please? You thirst. What's going on here? Can you help me, please? Nurse, have you seen my daughter? Have you seen my wife, Sarah? Have you? Have you seen Sarah? Sarah, where are you? - Tiffany! - Tiffany. Sarah? Tiffany? Drink and thirst no more. Drink. Thirst no more. I can't, it's empty. Drink. It's empty. You must drink and thirst no more. Drink and thirst no more. I can't, it's empty. I can't! Mr. Hatcher, I'm sorry. Did I wake you? Mr. Hatcher, are you okay? Hey. How's she doing? How are you doing? I could complain, but who's listening? I'm listening. The cancer has spread. It's everywhere. They've done all they can do, and now my... My daughter... It wasn't supposed to be like this. It never is. That's it? The biggest and most unanswered question of the human race is "Why?" "Why is this happening?" "Why now? Why me?" Twelve years ago, I find myself sitting in an emergency room asking "Why?" "Why is this happening? Why me? "Why them?" I wasn't always a pastor. I was an engineer. At Ford. I was married, had two kids. Two boys. Charles and Jake. They were good boys. What happened? She had just picked them up from daycare, and they were headed to the mall to buy me a birthday present. He crossed the median. They were dead on impact. So, I sat in the emergency room and I asked "Why?" Is this where you tell me that God answered all your questions? No. We're always asking him why, and he rarely answers in that moment. Then why are you here? Because, Tom, that wasn't the end of my story. In all my brokenness, God wasn't done with me. In fact, it was that very brokenness that allowed people to let me into their hurt, and I discovered that I could be a light to others suffering in the darkness, and that is how I found life again. "Why" was the question I asked 12 years ago. I finally asked, "What do you want me to do, God?" And? And I allowed God to work through me. Things started to change in my life, a lot of things. When you live a life submitted to God, it's an adventure, and you never know where it will take you. Which, I have learned includes me getting punched in the jaw by a fireman. You're crazy. I'm a lot of things, Tom, but crazy's not one of them. Hi. Ooh. That's a nice picture. It's me, and that's everybody I know. That's very pretty. What's heaven like? Well, it's a lot like here, only nobody's sick, everybody's happy. I don't wanna be sick anymore. - It stinks, huh? - Yeah. Tiffany, can I pray for you? Okay. Dear God, touch little Tiffany. I pray peace and comfort for this family. We ask healing and comfort. Thank you, Lord, for everything you've done, are doing and will do. - Amen. - Amen. She was always so worried about those ducks. Always. I couldn't find the words. All night, I wrote. It wasn't good enough. I couldn't find the words. Though Tiffany has left this world, she is more alive than we could ever imagine. But here, our memories help keep her alive in our hearts. I was blessed... I am blessed to have met Tiffany. It was only a month, a month I will always remember. A little girl spoke into my life, and I am better for it. However, it's her father, Tom, that will keep her memory alive. At this time, I'd like to invite him to share with you some of his cherished memories. Tom. I spent all night trying to write a eulogy worthy of her memory. Then I found this book. "This is a story of how Tiffany Hatcher..." "...beat the devil. "My name is Tiffany Hatcher, and I am six-and-a-half years old. "I have cancer, but this isn't a sad story, "this is a happy story. "I live in Michigan with my daddy, "and we have a pond in the neighborhood. "Ducks live there. "I like to play with them. I think we're best friends. "My daddy is a fireman..." "My daddy is a fireman and my mommy was a mommy. "She was the best mommy, and we did everything together. "When Mommy got sick, we were all sad." "...we were all sad. Daddy cried a lot, and I prayed a lot. "When Mommy died, I asked God to help Daddy. "We played again. "Then I got sick." "Then I got sick. "Daddy yelled at God a lot, "and I told God I was sorry. "One day, I dreamed about Mommy and God, "and they told me that Daddy would be okay." "...and they told me that Daddy would be okay. "They said I was a good girl, "but I was still sad because Daddy was sad." It'll be okay, Daddy. I know, bug. "Then, one day, Pastor Dan came to see me. "He told me angels were our helpers. "I told him I saw an angel once. "He was nice." "I hope my ducks will be okay "and not miss me as much as I'll miss them." So nice. This is how Tiffany Hatcher beat the devil. She was an angel. My angel. Each day I spent with her was a tiny glimpse into heaven. She made me smile when I was sad. And she was so smart. And she often challenged my own stubbornness. Just like her mom. I'm going to miss her more than I could ever explain. Thank you. - Great sermon, great words. - Thank you, Chief. - God bless you. - Thank you, Chief. Bless you and your family. Thank you for coming. I appreciate it. Tommy, we're gonna go back to the house now. - Everything okay? - He's tired. First my Sarah, now this. I just can't be here anymore. Let me get you a ride, okay? We're gonna walk. Okay. Guys, take care. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Tom. Thank you for coming. She was a special little girl. Please, let everyone at the hospital know how much I appreciate them. You know, in case I don't get a chance. I will. Thanks. Tom, I have something for you. It's from Tiffany. It's a letter, a note, that we did together, but I swear she wrote it all herself and it was all her own idea. I just feel kind of funny giving it to you. I just could never keep it from you. Just, please, read it later, okay? Okay. Thank you. Hey, it was a beautiful service. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, Pastor Underwood would like to see you in his office if you have a minute. Sure. You don't to have to worry about them. No one's gonna leave before they serve the chicken. Tom, come in. Sit down. This is for you. It's a Bible. I can see that. It's from Tiffany. "Dear Daddy, Merry Christmas and Happy Birthday. "I love you. Tiffany." There's more. "Dear Tom, you gave your daughter a good life, "and now it's time to do the same for yourself. "Tiffany loved you very much, "but her love is nothing compared to the love of the Father. "So use this book wisely, my friend. "Yours truly, "Dan Underwood." When I asked her if there was something I could do for you, she said she wanted to get you a Bible. When I asked her if there was anything else, she said, "For my daddy to be happy." It's gonna take some time, and you'll never get over this, but I do hope that one day you can be happy again. I'm lost. We all are. We're all alone until we realize that God is right there, alongside us, always. He will never leave us or forsake us. I don't know what to do, Dan. Don't lose hope. Have faith. Can you feel it, even with all of this garbage heaped upon you? Feel what? God's love. It's all around. Sarah said the same thing to me just before she died. Thanks for everything. This is just the beginning. Hi, Dad. I'm not gonna be around much longer. Dr. Robinson says so. I'm scared. But it's okay because I wanna see Mommy. Nurse Melissa is really nice. She gives me ice cream and reads me stories. I think you should marry her. I talk to Mommy when I dream and Mommy likes her, too. I like getting to talk to Pastor Dan. I'm glad he's your friend, and you're going to church again. You're a fireman, and you know medicine, too. You can help people. Please let God work through you. I love you. Bye, Daddy.
