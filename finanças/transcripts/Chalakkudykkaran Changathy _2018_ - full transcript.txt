Once Rajumon asked me, Who is uncle's father? I told he is a king. One with crown, scepter, And a throne. Aking! Whenever he would see me then, He used to tease and call me, Friends Rajakumaran. Aking's son. Yes, I am an Uhd6FWOTld prince. I am the prince ofthe Llhd6HNOTld. My father, He was one of the rowdy in this city. Yourfather was a snake who used crawl on the ground after drinking. Hey Mani. Speak what you can pronounce properly. Have you finished all your acts? It's over. Then do one thing. Rowdy's son get down from the throne, Climb that slanted coconut tree and pluck a bunch of ripe ones. Okay. If the Lord says then nothing to talk back. "L told you before itself not to go, not to go" -"Don't go to pluck coconuts" - Hey Mani. What? Is it not the season? Yes, it's at the right stage. If it stays more itwill go hoar and become rotten coconut like Lord. Hey Raja Mani. Yes Lord. Climb four more extra coconut trees, And try to earn more money instead of playing frog game. This is not frog ortoad, Lord. This is Mimicry, Mimicry. Oh yeah. Whatever cry it is, Cinema is not for you. Nothing as such, Lord. Someone will give me a chance and I will become a great actor.

If it is to drinktoddy go find someone else. Let him work. Toddy? We? We were talking about drinking Scotch. Scotch? Yes Scotch. From where? Adding nice grapes, battery and leech, We made the proper Scotch. When we said Scotch did you see how the Lord's face turned? Stop making Lord yearn and tell the reason why you came. Hey Mani they took you in cinema. They called the medical store and asked you to come quickly. That's all. What did you say? Tell me once again. Hey dearthey took you in cinema. Oh.

Oh now the mike is in trouble. Hello, hello, hello. Let's give it the other side. There is no sound heard from this, are you fooling? - Greetings Mani brother. - Greetings. - Greetings Mani brother. - Sit, sit. No need of so much respect. I am the father. He is taking out the drinks. Ifyou take it out I will hit you. With Tamil and Telugu I got little busy. I am unable to meet you guys. Today I will clearthat complaint. Being only a comedian Rajamani, When the first movie you acted as Hero and it was a hit. Many said jackfruit fell and rabbit died. Now Rajamani has turned into the busiest actor in south India. - What do you feel? - Feels proud. I feel happy- I neverthought I will reach still here. Who didn't think? - I knew it. - He started. The astrologer had said that he will become a big actor. It's all His blessings. Then her prayers. All this is her luck too. Only after she became a part of me. All this happened. I have something to say. What father? What do you have to say? Nothing, I have nothing to say. Was it an arranged marriage? Why are you asking so? My son is dark. And saying that his caste is low. Many have rejected him. But God himselfgave this beautiful girl to my son. Do you know? One question to Mrs. Rajamani. How is the life with a cinema actor? Tell. I am lucky enough to be Mani's wife. So it's over lets drink? In Trikaavil temple, I saw Anitha forthe first time. I thought it's just my thinking. Then I saw her properly. Then I started visiting temple regularly. I can see God and also. Valya house Menon sir's? Daughter. Don't you know me? I am Rajamani. I know. Once I knew Anitha likes me. I decided to ask Menon sir for her hand. But when I saw Menon sir's silence. I thought it's gone. When we went to Kanoor girl's father was Aromal's son in law. Will this be a relative of Thacholichan? But Menon sir said something else. What caste? There is only caste on this earth. Humanity. Then in my life only luck and heights were there. So it's over right? Let's drink. Oh he came. Greetings, oh my Sooriyanna do you know where and all I went? If it was a blue film I would have easily got it. You are the true Sabu secretary. You have a good future. I don't like this alcohol at all. I won't say so I love it. Sabu pour one more. No need, no need. Let's talk first and then drink. Suriya is already too much now. No. Kananuni. We must destroy that company of Hari completely. You were doing lot of work under him for some time. That's why we are giving all this work to Kananuni. Instead of bending your knees in front of the stars, It's better to have a street shot in Paalarivatta is what he said. We will make director Hari in Paalarivatta, Put a street shop. No need of street shop. Let him put a toddy shop. But that Hari shouldn't raise his finger at the stars, if he does, Not just the finger. We will chop his hand also. That's what even I want. The one who came to teach me the rules in cinema. We don't want him in cinema. If we take Hari out from industry. Two superstars date, Will be given to me. Remember right? He is the one who got profit out ofthis. He will do only super stars movies henceforth. He is coming, Hari's assistant. Everyone is here, greetings sir. Greetings. - Eepachappa greetings. - Sit. You are looking smart. Sit. Just sit. Should I sit down or on lap? I will stand here sir. Why did you call me for? Malayalam cinema's directors, New associations, Secretary is Kananuni. He will tell the matter. This director Hari, Disrespecting an, He disrespected our art? Without my knowledge? Not that Kala, its art field. He has dirtied the entire art field. We are banning him. He is the leader. I am not acting in any of Hari sir's movies. But for my new movie's deity. It will be Hari sirwho will be lighting the lamp. Just lighting lam p right let him do it. No need in manners and in status too, He has done lot of dirty works. We don't want him in cinema field anymore. Okay no need. What are you doing? Hey Mani. Oh no. Oh. What kind ofdrinking is this Mani? Even I got stunned. Forgive sir, this is the habit of us from Chaalakudi. One sip we finish it. Smart. Kananuni sir. Don't scare us. Tomorrow the one who will be lighting the lamp for my movie, Will be Hari sir. It's my good luck charm. Oh like that. He is good. He drank 34 pegs together. Very strong. What strong? More stronger people than them, We have made them kneel down and ask for forgiveness. Malayalam cinema's roaring lion, Tilothaman, what is his current state? From Christian fathers and English movies we took him out right? What is this Mani, who has no name and place? Who is standing there? Hey Mani, haven't you gone yet? Thief. Brother. I didn't see. You get LIP- Get up. What did you say in TV today? The actor in Thilothaman died. Do you knowthe meaning of acting? Kananuni. Tell me. That's because you were in bad manners, And bad behavior. Ba, ba, ba, ba. You all have gathered here to discuss, About banning actors, I have come knowing that. You called Ayikode as crazy. Now you want to destroy Hari. Forthat you will say any kind of lies. Hey Kananuni. The association that you are making now. For the heads of the cinemas, And for your sake. Understood Kananuni. But Su riya. I didn't expect you in this group. You were like a son to me. To ban me, Okay. Tilothaman brother don't get emotional. Sit here, what is this? Hey Dhinesh. I know you are the most poisonous in this group. You arethe main role in this group. If you go fonlvard Iikethis. Time will give it back to you, be careful. Kananuni got scared. - Who ran? - That's great actor Rajamani sir. - Which room? -504. Keep this bag in my room. Sir. Hari sir. Why did you run seeing me? I am unfaithful guy sir. Rogue, only a rogue. Butyou didn't do anything right? Is there anything more to do than this? Though sirtold me no need, no need. I took you forcefully. Then forthe same movie they made some other fellow and light the lamp. No other way sir. What you did was right. You always say that I am responsible for your growth. If you had taken another decision. For your destruction also, I am the reason you would have said this. All my hopes are going wrong. No matter how big I become. I am the same old coconut tree climber for people. Mani, taking all the troubles of life. Without anyone's help you earned this position. Don't lose that. You must go to greater heights. You don't worry about me. No one can ban or defeat anyone. Except death. Paadi, Dravida king's palace. Today I will handcuff, And take him through Chaalakudi town. Good themed set up. Is no one here? Hello. Oh everyone is here. How come sir here? A black tea? Oh black tea? I thought toddy. Yesterday drinking toddy near forest check post you gave full performance right? We have got com plaint. It's over yesterday only sir. Who said so? Come and get in the vehicle. You should have thought before drinking. Many are trying to prove that I am a drunkard. Let it be. But yesterday I wasn't drunk. Without reason they came up on me. Still Iwas quiet. If that's not it. And you wish to arrest me and put me in jail and disrespect me. Let it happen. Oh respectful person from respected family. You are coconut climber Ramappan's son right? Well known super star, Rajamani. Notjust Ramappan, Even Rajamani was a coconut tree climber. Why do you want to take my father's name in vain? Don't tell my father's name again. Who are you? A fellow who is from nowhere. Attitude of making a little money. You built police station and gave. You built house for poor ones. You made marriages. Who are you? Mahabali king? You have experience in hitting police in cinema. But have you experience the heat of the original police? Not just once about your father, lwill call 10 times. Has my hands got heat? Hello, Eepachha I am Rajamani's manager Jose. Police have come here. Full fights. Eepachhan should immediately call minister and SP and tell. I don't involve in such shameful cases. What shameful case? It's not rape. You involve and close even such cases too. From yesterday we are holding your leg. To solve this problem. If you like finish it. If not there are proper boys who have guts. They will finish it. Listen, he is almost killing sir. Let's not involve he needs it. You thought you will do it to me. This is the hand which has climbed trees and done all sort of work. If I give you one with this. - Sir, ADGP. - Leave. - Sir here. - To insult Rajamani, Few forest officers, And police officers, Built this fake case. Though everyone says save the schedule caste and protect them. When it comes to action it's only in words. For the people belonging to that part, An awkward feeling towards them, Is what they have in heart. Instead of Mani, If it was any other super star who would have done this, Would the police behave like this? So in Malayalam cinemas are there caste and creed sir'? Notjust in Malayalam cinemas. In our state, When it comes to action, These caste and color will all come up. But we won't keep such kind of people in police. Than cinema fight this was superb. It's Eepachhan. Hello. RajamanLyou did well. ADGP Ben Kumar spoke about you, In TV now did you see? Why? Didn't Eepachhan like it? From the time the forest officers held me yesterday. I have called around 50 times. I was about to call the Minister now. That's when I saw the news on TV. Don't act anymore Eepachha. I have seen this a lot. When I first acted as Hero. Saying my caste and color, You ignored and left the movie, without forgetting that, I came to help you in election. That's Mani, I love my people so much. That director Mani just made it up. You said so and tried to make everyone believe that. But time is proving that what Hari sir said was true. Okay Eepachha. Justgo. Understood, this is the shot. Superb shot. Trolley back, trolley back. Oh bestjuice. Art. Fill this glass. You finished it? Very good. Mix some more and keep. Here. Where is it? Oh okay. Ifthis is the shot. Art guy's hands will break by filling the glass with juice. - An. -| will rm sir. Good. Bring and give. Jose picked the call. Mani is not keeping well. How is that possible? Ask him to come. There are a couple of shots here then it's over. Othenivise too this will finish. They are not listening though I said you are not well, Mani. - Let's go. - I am sick. But Mani what about the money we took in advance? - How much did you take? -5. Give it back. I am planning to stop acting. What are you saying? Where is the Laddu? In the tension that Mani hasn't come yet. Sir. - What? - I don't think he will come. What? He don't like to act now a day. If he says so how is it possible? He said he will give back the advance. Shall we see someone else? No need. No need John. Only if he does that character it will be good. But what about your date? Don't bother about that. You speak to him. Iwill come. Mani brother. How is it going? Is it Kavitha? Sit. How come here? A Telugu film shoot. I came for that, that's when I got to know you are here. Which movie? Not cinema. A program for Malayali assembly. Now you are in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. Very busy right? It's all because of your help. I know only to help. What's the reason? What's hurt and what's hardship. I have experienced it properly. Shall I ask you something? I thought of asking several times. What brother? You said you will become my heroine. Then you refused it. Was it to make fun of me? Or was it because my color is black? What? Did you forget? No, I won't forget. In controlling cinema, We ladies have no role brother. Some decide. Sometimes they order. We have to obey them. They say it's common in cinema. Do you know why you don't understand that brother? Because you are only a human. An innocent human. Attimes notjust in cinemas, We will have to act in real life too. I am yourfan brother. Morning he started drinking. He won't listen too. He didn't eat anything too. From morning you are drinking. Eat at least this. You go inside, And bring one more bottle. No need Mani it's too much. I need one more peg. You listen to me, how much will you drink like this? I asked you to bring. Go and get it, go. Who to say? Who will listen? Here drink. - What? Do you want money? - No need. - Then? - I cameto take you home brother. Drinking like this and making people talk unnecessary things. Why are you self spoiling like this brother? You won't understand that. You go. No, lwill take you and go home. Bala I told you to leave. Bala you go now. Iwill bring Mani. You guys are spoiling my brother like this. You drink or die do anything you want. Just leave my brother alone. Brother, come let's go, come. I shouldn't see you here again, get out. Is Mani sirthere? Oh YOU guys? You guys are still alive? Mani sir, are you well? Oh they have come to ask about my health, All the way from Chennai taking vehicle. Tell the reason why you have come. Mani sir we would like to talkto you. You complaint SP that we cheated crores of rupees from you. That's not a problem for us. We will make IG call. Do you know that we have bigger actors than you with us in this case? That too Malayalam actors. Do you want to fight unnecessarily? There is no document for the 10 crores that you gave sir. No need of any document. If I have given money I know to take it back too. The 10 crore that I gave was not to push it into yourthroats. I gave my money and bought a land. With trust I wrote it on your boss's name. Now that land was sold for 10 times more value. I should get 25 crores from that. 4 crore is there in this. This should end here. You can't do anything even ifl don't give this now. But a cou rtesy. If still it doesn't get over. You cannot work with this face again. - Take out your hand. - I will. No need leave. Leave m e. Listen to me Mani let them go. Leave. Let's inform the police. That's stupidity. This is black. There are chances that they might inform, Police that there is cash here. Then what will we do? You movethe cash from here. What if we keep it in your house? No need, it's not safe. For now take it to your house and keep. Let no one else know about it now. Okay. H 6V- Hey what happened? Nothing. Then what is this blood? Haven't I told you not to drink? -It's okay. - Get u p. Get up. He has good drinking habit right? Hey nothing as such, occasionally. You mean once in a week? There is no day ortime where he won't drink in a week. That's true. Mani is our favorite artist. Vomiting blood means, You must stop drinking. Oh no, I haven't vomited. A little. And a little color change that's it. No doctor it's been a couple of times now. How much ever it is, you must completely stop drinking. If not you will lose liver. If it becomes addiction it's very difficult to stop. So stay here for a week. It would be a rest too. No, it's not possible. Today we have auto drivers program. I was also an auto driver before. Program means it's a strain Mani. That's not a problem. Program means it's a spirit for me.

There is no more medication to be given than this. Doctor, any other way? He is in a state where his liver cannot be replaced as well. If he won'tdrink he will live for some more time. If a 200 ml alcohol enters his body. In this current state anything can happen. God. Mani. Let's go come, get up. What did the doctor say? But there is no drinking from today. He has given medicines.

"This year we will get" When did you come, Sakir? Quite some time. Where were you? I called you many times. I was very busy. Here. Scotch, 90 years old. Oh glad, but I don't want it now.

Buy it. - Mani I will be back. - Okay go and come. - Sakir. - Okay go. Okay then. Sakir come let's sit inside. Okay come. Sit. Make some black tea. - Sugar is fine right? - Yes. - Why did you take such a decision? - Why? Ifthe registration is not done, We will lose the 10 Iakh given as advance. They are not simple guys. If the agreement won't happen, You won't get back a single rupee. If it happens, if you sell it again you will get 20 lakh profit. If you won't get when you catch. Then what to do? Everyone whom I trusted cheated me properly. I put 4 crore rupees trusting you. Can you arrange the rest in a week's time? If not all the money is gone. It's not that I haven't tried, if you add it won't increase. This real estate business won't suit me. Black tea is ready. First time I am drinking black tea coming here. Good. 6 crore is not a big deal for you guys. If you do a Telugu movie you can get it back in 56 months. But it's not the same with me. 4 Crore rupee means, If I work hard a lifetime I won't get it. You don't worry Sakir. You trusted me and putthat4 right? Iwill give that. You won't go on loss for standing with Mani. What happened, Mani? In new business Mani close friend. I heard that he joined the enemy gang. Are these cinema guys like this? Acting Sri Raman's role on the screen. But in actual life it's Ravan's role. There is no use of talking about that. I am not there to cheat anyone. It's enough if Sakir gets his money back. Then mine. It's okay they are all friend's right. Raju, take that money and give it to Sakir. No need now, tomorrow get it to office. - Then lwill bring it tomorrow morning. - That's enough. Shall I leave then? - Okay then let's see later. - Okay. Oh you came early. Did son wake up? Father. Come, come, father's son come here. Are you going to hospital? Yes brother, how is Mani brother? Now everything is fine. What happened to Mani brother? Nothing. A little chest burn. - Then? -lt's better now. Not chest burn, liver problem because of alcohol. You haven't told anything here? Shall I leave now sister? Ask brother to reduce drinking. God, hope nothing happens. You freshen up and come I will make dosa. No need, give me that cup board's key. I have to take the money. What? Jessy. What happened? Give the key. - I have to take the money and go. - Raju. Son. Father. No take me wrong. That money. I rolled that money. What have you done? With whose permission did you take that money? Oh my God what will I do now? Don't worry money is not here now. Only one hour is needed. We will get the money, rightfathel'? Yes, then what? Son, it's not safe to keep that money here. Moreoverthere is no use of it to anyone. I have given it to our Thomas. 5 for 100 interests. 5 percent of 5 crore means its 20 Iakhs. Have you ever seen 5 crores and 20 Iakhs? This is one indecent work that you have done. Did you forget all that? Do you remember the reason why he is standing Iikethis here? At time you go there you will get it back. - Then what? - Still this is kind of cheating. Don't fear son. One day. I will give backthe money tomorrow. One day? You said one hour'? He trusted me and gave it. Have some patience Raju. You will get back the money tomorrow itself. Shavaliyar Sir. Yes Raju, sit. No need. I asked you to sit not because of the respect on you. Ifl keep looking up my neck hurts. Sit. Sahir sir. Sahir sir had to go to Mumbai urgently. He had told Raju will come. Sir. Where is it? Is it in vehicle? Sir. I haven't got the cash. Key is with father. He will be back tomorrow morning. Once he reaches immediately I will bring it to you. That's okay. You should tell Mani brother not to delay any further. Sahir sir is really in a lock. - Hey Raju. - Where are you going? Start moving. - Where? - Move the vehicle. - But where? - Hey just move. First when you hear you will feel bad. You might even get angry. Maybe you might feel like killing me. But. You won't get that money for now. Not that you won't get, I won't give. What did you say? Do you know whose money is that? What's there to know? It's Mani's. There is no paper for that money we both know it. Meaning its proper black. Mani has got around 200 crore of property if he loses 4 in that it doesn't matter to him. But for you to say 4 crore you would need one whole life. You. Leave me boy, don't ever think you will get back that money. Sometimes man has to show unfaithfulness. That's for his own goodness. Sin of killing will go once you eat it. By cheating him ifl am going to get some money. If it's for my children's goodness. I don't find any mistake in that. See the vehicle came. Don't go. Iwill hold yourleg. For God's sake don't do this to me. Son in law, he is taking blessings. Move son. You. "Without sucking milk, I am feeling hungry" "Breaking the peanuts have to make food" "Stomach" - Hello sir. - What's the matter'? Where are you? Iam here in Paadi. What happened to you? What? Nothing sir. I had met doctor Vasudevan. He told me everything, what is this Mani? Doctors just say something and make usfear sir.

Okay, be careful. Okay sir. Raju, Raj-u- Oh okay. Why did you hide the bottle? You said no one will drink, but you can drink right? What is it? Nothing. Did you give money to Sakir? Yes, I gave. What did he say? Nothing, I have to see someone urgently. I am a little busy. What happened to him? Did he drink so much? Hey waiter. It's a good feeling to drive without drinking. That's Raju right? What is he doing? Stop, SfOP- Is he raping the bike? Hey Raju. What is this buffalo? What happened? Get up - Vehicle's. - Vehicle's? Vehicle's petrol got over. Not because vehicle's petrol got over. Because the petrol you drank is too much. What are you thinking? If Mani gets to know. Looking at this even he will start. Hold him. Put him in vehicle. Hey Ramu. Go dunk him in water for some time. Nonsense fellow. Hold him. Get down. Get down. Go give him bath, onlythen he will be fine. Just dunk him and bring. He has got from me. - Mani. - Mani, everything is okay.
