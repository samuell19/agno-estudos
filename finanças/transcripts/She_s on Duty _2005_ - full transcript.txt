She's on Duty Operation Dokdo: 67 days 20 hrs 48 min Kim Sun-ah Gong Yoo - Let's rock'n roll. - Move! Nam Sang-mi Ha Jung-woo Noh Ju-hyun, Kim Sang-ho Hey, what's up? Long time no see! Stupid girls! This isn't a fuckin' picnic! You know that? They'll let us do some freaky video thing! You're not afraid? Cut the crap, you thought it could be something like washing dishes? Okay, got you. You're all dead, bastards. 318, come in, Dokdo, over. I'm starving. Hurry up and get me out of here! Hold on, we'll be breaking out the champagne in a minute. 3 spotted on the 2nd floor. 3 at the entrance. 4 on the stairs, and... - What about Hammer? - Hammer? What the...! Just hang on until we spot him! Got it? Hey, you're not really a teenager, are you? What're you talking about? Of course I am. I'm a junior in high school Take a close look. You'll see just how young I am! Get outta here! Who wears their school uniform to a place like this, huh? You're really driving me crazy, I was born in 1988, wanna see my ID? ID? I mean... my student ID. You just don't get what you need for this kind of work, do you? This outfit and this cute hairstyle are just what it takes to drive men wild. I really don't give a shit about what you think! Hammer has just come in. Okay, hang on one minute. We're moving in. What do you think? These chicks are hot. Aren't they? I'm sure my boss will be happy with them. Absolutely. Tonight you'll be on your way to Japan! Excited, right? Damn! Hammer! You're under arrest... for human traffic and suspected murder. Who the hell are you, bitch? Who do you think I am? I'm a cop. Get your hands up, or I'll blow your head off! You're a rookie, aren't you? What? Kiss my ass, you stupid. I'm dying to taste that bullet! I bet you don't have the guts to pull that trigger! Watch the hair! Sir, kill the bitch! You idiot! Hammer, real name LEE Man-duk! - And you're...? - Yeah, I'm a cop... it sucks, huh? He's Detective JOH from the head office. Known as "the snake." He's notorious for not letting anything go once he bites into it. A minute? I didn't know one minute took that long! And how about the champagne you promised me! He said this was theirjurisdiction, and for us to back down! You call that an excuse? Just image talking a hot girl into coming home with you, And right when you're about to score, your friend comes in and takes her. Would you just stand back and say, "Hey, she's all yours"? You think I'm an idiot? I'll kill the fucker. Yes, you're an idiot! How would I ever trust you? Thank you for your cooperation. A pity, the mission ended up so badly. I'll e-mail you my report. I'm not worried. I put full trust in you. - Well then - Crook! Excuse me? Think about what you did! Even before that, think about how you ruined the operation! What did I ruin? What did I ruin? Why don't you kindly let me know what it is that I ruined? Hammer was small time! If you hadn't stuck your clumsy nose into it, we'd have gotten the Yakuza under boss! Now do you get it, idiot? Hey, Jane, where're you going? Hey! I'm going to see the captain. Wanna come? No. Directed by K.C. Park CHA Young-jae, age 45. The number 2 man of the Whacker, the biggest crime gang in Seoul. Our target is BAE Doo-sang, its boss. CHA accepted our deal to testify against BAE, in exchange for immunity. But the deal went bad yesterday while he was being transported. You mean there was a leak? The worst of it is that we've lost CHA's faith. The trial is only weeks away, so... We have to do whatever it takes to get him back in our custody. So what are our options? CHA Seung-hee, age 17. Ajunior at Young-Mun High School. She's CHA's only child. Our plan is to put her under around the clock surveillance. The moment CHA contacts her, we'll get him. Thank you. You're kidding right? - Pardon me? - Around the clock? Are you talking about installing damn cameras everywhere? How would you watch her 24 hours? Use your head, and think of something! Sir! Now that's using your head! Uncle, you can't be serious? Don't call me uncle. This is official business. Alright, SIR! Me going undercover as a high school student? Do you really think this will work? This is your assignment. Make the impossible POSSIBLE! You gotta be kidding! You know how much I hated school! It's hell. How could you make me go back? Everyday the same boring routine, study, study, and more studying! Study? What do you know about studying? You don't even know how to spell 'study'! You hated studying, books! And what did you wind up being in school? The leader of the school gang. That was a long time ago. And I'm not going back to school, period. Why not something other than a student! Let me go undercover as a teacher. It's more natural, what do you think? Teach what? English? Math? Korean? Physics? Science? History? Uncle, think about your health! You always talk about quitting smoking, but you never do. Don't change the subject. You have choices do it, or turn in your badge. Are you threatening me? That's not fair. CHUN Jane! Yes, sir, Mr. CHUN! Get out! I want to introduce a new student joining our class. Welcome her! Okay. I'm CHUN Jane! It's nice to meet you, guys! - What's wrong with her? - Oh my god. If you have anything you want to say, go ahead. No, sir. Go have a seat in the empty desk over there. Be quiet, guys. Remember, you've just made a new friend. At your age, friendship is as important as anything else in school life. So I want you to help her kindly get used to things around here. Got it? Prefect! Attention. - Bow! - I love you all! What's with the I love you all? It's his idea of not making anyone feel left out. Wow, that's really something... What's with the wrinkles! You had aging disease or something? What? Look who's talking! What's with you and your oversized boobs? You got inflammatory disease? Disease? - It's over for you, girl. - What? The leader of the school's girl gang protects her. - Gang leader? - Yeah, She's cold blooded and ruthless. Just say to her, you're sorry. Once someone pushes her buttons, nothing's gonna stop her! You're new here. Don't forget that. You should watch what you say and do, bitch! And why are you causing troubles on your first day, bitch? Are you trying to get yourself killed, bitch? In the yard, at lunch, be there. If you don't show, you can say goodbye to that cute face of yours. It's over for this bitch. Hey! Where is the yard? You! Think twice about trying to be so tough. Yes, ma'am. Or I'll make you regret ever being born. Hands up! And you! I'm sick of your dirty mouth! Calling people bitch! Okay. I said hands up! Hi, you're in my class, right? I just transferred here today. I get the feeling that... there's something we have in common. Let's be friends. You and me? Excuse me. Don't take it personal. She's shy, that's all. I'm KANG No-young. Um... right. I'm new here, too. How about being friends? Friends? What class are you in? I love you all! My class? What's this? Sorry about earlier! From now on, I want you to look after me. Seung-hee isn't her usual self today. Making a mistake on a simple problem like this. Anybody else want to give it a try? If Seung-hee can't do it, none of us can. That's right. Well, looks like there's a new student here? Jane! Where are you? Yes? Your file says you were a top student at your previous school. I was? Come up and show us how smart you are. No... there must be some kind a of mistake. There's no need to be so modest. Show us what you can do. Alright, let's continue next time. Are you trying to kill me, or something? It's bad enough being stuck here in school all day! Then what, a top student? You want me to give up this op! Calm down. Seung-hee's good at classes. So it'd help in getting you closer to her. Alright, just do get the job done. Hey, see what your excessive loyalty to her did? - It'd help her befriend... - Shut up! This is where you'll be staying during the assignment. Do you like it? What's all this shit about? Seung-hee might come over at any time, so... I made sure to make everything just right. Again the excessiveness! And what's with the bags? It's for your convenience. Each bag has different books in it, depending on what day it is. That's Seung-hee's house. Wow, look at that. - It must me very expensive. - Why? Panning on buying one? Noway. Even gang's family live in luxury. What about us? Do you still rent? Don't ask about it. I just moved to a smaller house. My wife got sick and kids' tuition... You can't imagine. I feel like having a drink. Shall we? It's on me. I don't drink with minors. Oh, come on. Are you kidding me? I got more information about Seung-hee, Take a look. There's more? You live here? I'm over there on the 2nd floor. How nice! You're welcome any time. Hey, Seung-hee, wait! CHA Seung-hee, born in Seoul, on Sep 141988, used to be cheerful. Experienced a sudden change and became introverted... Since her mom's death from breast cancer. And she's almost given up her social life. Almost? No! Completely given up. Yes! Let's see... her hobby is computer... What's that you're reading? What book is that? For whom the bell tolls. You have taste! Yeah... I like classics. What are you doing here, anyway? Me? I live here. BAE Doo-sang, the infamous leader of the Whacker, the biggest crime gang... was summoned to the prosecutors office in question for murder charges, but was released due to insufficient evidence and health problem. The prosecutors have ordered him not to leave the country, and are in a desperate search for solid evidence and witnesses... before his upcoming arraignment. This is CHOI Yoon-young, MBN News. Your blood type? Go to hell, you son of a bitch! Type A? Type B? Or Type C? Tell me, if you want to live. Well, I don't fuckin' care whether you tell me or not. A? AB? A? Once a dog is pushed to the point of death, it becomes a meek slave. - You know what to do! - Yes, sir. Any news about CHA? Sorry sir, but... You know my rule. Don't show any mercy to rats. Bring me CHA before the trial, or you'll be the on this bed bleeding to death. Don't worry about a thing, boss. I'll have the bastard kneeling down in front of you soon. How? You know my men, sir. The Jellyfish, the Giant Clam... They're out there as we speak tracking him down. There's no way he'll get away. Do you actually think those idiots are capable? CHA worked his way to be the second boss. He's not stupid like you! But you, on the other hand, obviously are stupid! What's a nerd like you doing with a trendy phone like this? - How much was it? - Give it back to me! That's pretty good. You do talk. I thought you were a mute. Give it back! Hey, take it easy, bitch. I just wanna see it. Hello? Seung-hee's busy working the streets right now, who's this? It's... your father. I didn't know it was your father, he should've said something earlier. You bitch! Get up! Did you forget? I love you all! What the fuck? Who do you think you are? Hey! What did I tell you about your being tough? Man, what a beautiful day! I know you're depressed 'cause of what happened... But forget it, just think about this beautiful weather. Thanks for what you did for me, but... Don't get the wrong idea and try to get sweet with me! Such a pessimist! You remind me of a stubborn person I've known of. It isn't easy trying to be friends with you, is it? I just don't feel like talking to anyone right now. What are you doing? It's a... I'm doing yoga. Can't you see? Come on, try it. Stretch your legs! - Jane! - What? - You're a cop, right? - What? Seoul Police Department Well... this is... uh... Don't you have any other shirts? Do you want one of mine? Yeah... thanks. Dad! What do we have here? Why aren't you changing into your gym clothes? My advice, get to class on time! Shut your mouth! Hold on. Any ideas about who these guys are? He's the best fighter. I heard of you, you little punk! Wanna dance with me, sweetie! - Dance? You mean like this? - Shit. Sorry, but I'm a little busy to take care of you now. Go on home babe. You lost your mind or something? Don't even try to talk your way out of this! - Outside, now! - Where? Is your brain not working? You wanna do it here then? Your coming to me like this doesn't surprise me anymore. I'm happy to see my daughter. Are you all right? Look at you, you look like you've been sick. Are you serious? I'm going to be an adult soon. So, you need to be taking care of yourself, not me. Don't worry, I'm fine. I don't have any problems. So then why do you have to come to see your daughter this way? I love you, even if you are a murderer. You're the only family I have. But I can't forgive you. Don't worry about a thing, I'll handle this. You cuties. Seung-hee, What's going on? Open the door! Oh, please, I can't hold it anymore! Is it locked? I saw Seung-hee go in. She must've fallen asleep while studying in there. Don't say 'study'. It makes me even sick! Unlock the door, Seung-hee! I want you to study abroad like you always wanted to. - As you've always said so... - I won't go! Why don't you just go to another bathroom? I can't move a bit. Just one step and I'll 'go'. - Is Seung-hee... - Stop talking to me. - I am... - Open the door Seung-hee! Is Seung-hee inside? Open the door Seung-hee! Out of the way. Hi! Seung-hee! Ah, feels like heaven. No sweat! What the! You're dead man. Wanna go another round? - KANG. - Hey, Jane. - CHA's here! - What? He's back? - Are you serious? - I'm serious! Get the hell out of my way! She is running away. Who does she think she is! Come back here! You're dead. Who the...? What are you doing? Stop right there! Come back here you punks. Sir, CHA's here. - Where? - Behind the school. Hurry, move. Stop! Damn! What took you so long! He got away! - Can I drink this? - Sure. KANG, look up the license plate number 36Ra2623. What's your take on this? I've got a better idea. It's clean and simple! I'll threaten Seung-hee like hell to tell me where her father is. What if she doesn't talk? I'll beat her until she does. That's what we do best, right? We're not thugs! We're cops! This car's been reported stolen. It must've been CHA. Get an APB out on the car. Anyway, Seung-hee is the key, for sure. How is it going with Seung-hee? Coming out could be a way! You know what? Maybe I should force her to like me? We're totally on two different pages! Then we need something to spark the friendship! What? The classical way is the best. I'll have some disguised thugs attack her on the way home. You jump in and save her life. And you'll gain her trust! How cliche! This is the 21st century, we need something modern! Don't we? Well, I think it's a great idea. Where did scientific methods go? Forget about science, I put more trust in my gut in certain cases. Make sure that you put some good men on this assignment. I want a real clean job. I'm happy to take care of them in an unscientific way. By the way, are you going to be okay? What are you talking about? Well, you're officially playing hooky right now. Is there no limit to the trouble you can get into? Cutting class, jumping the wall, and getting involved in gang fights? I'm sorry, sir. I'm positive your school records are false. You must've cheated! Don't say that, sir. I'm just not good at adjusting, but... So what exactly do you need to adjust? Your file says that you're under the custody of your uncle, right? What? Yes... sir. And your parents? They passed away. Oh... Well I need to see him tomorrow. What? What's with you anyway? Leave me alone. Go home already! She gave me a scary look today. You have to walk me home. Get outta here, or she won't be the one you have to worry about! Jane, please! So, you ran damn fast! But it ended up bad for us. We got in some serious trouble. So now we're gonna share some of the misery with you. Oh, really? You think you can talk your way out of this? Um, since your business is with her, it's alright if I go, right? You bitch, we're gonna take care of you first! You think you can get away with what you did? We'll teach you a lesson, you slimy traitor! Listen, I'd like to play, but I'm busy now. Tomorrow okay? Busy? You're not the only one busy! 1, 2, 3, let's do it! Let me do you a favor. I'll make this game short, all right? Man, you're really starting to annoy me! Am I? Well what are you gonna do about it, babe? What? How's this, boy? Don'tjust stand there, kill her! Shit, this is getting on my nerves! No-young! Sorry you had to get involved. Are you hurt? No, I'm fine. It was a good exercise. I feel refreshed! Hey, No-young, Seung-hee! Are you hurt? Are you all right? I saw everything! Alright, I'm gonna go. See you tomorrow. Alright, see you. Good-bye. What the...! Damn, that's some way to treat the guy who saved her life! I love you all. Why do you always play the nice guy? I hate the way you show off! Hey, come on! We're friends, remember? What happened to your leg? I must've landed on it wrong earlier. You looked all right up to now! I tried not to show it, so she wouldn't feel bad. Hey, that hurts! Can't you be gentler? Hey, you looked fine before, so... Why are you acting all soft in front of me! I pretended not to be in pain. So then why don't you keep pretending! You trying to finish me off, or something? You hurt your ankle and broke your watch... To impress a girl, but it cost you so much! But think about it, without the watch, I would've hurt my wrist, too. Okay, all done! You're really good at this! It's really your lucky day! Done. - Are you all right? - Yeah... How could such a young kid be so cool! But he's just a high school kid! Oh, come on, Jane! Who is it? Who is it? What're you doing here? Did I wake you? No, I was up, reading, you know. Can I come in? Well... I don't think it's appropriate. Please, don't say no, I can't take it anymore! It's not right... because... You're just a student! Aren't you a student? Oh my god, snap out of it! I must be crazy! Who is it? Stay calm, Jane. You can do it, come on. What's up? Aren't you going to school? It's already 8! What? School? Oh, damn! What do I do first? Socks! Shit, they stink! I wore them yesterday. Damn! So-young, what's going on? Um... Well... The whole school knows. You are the best fighter in school now! You big mouth! You told everything? But it's so cool! You control the whole school now! Very cool. Excuse me, but you must in the wrong room, this is music class! I know. Your music teacher is on leave for a short time. I'll be your sub for the time being. My names JOH Ki-hoon. Hey, rookie! We're going to have fun. I want answer, now! Is this supposed to make sense? First calm down, then we'll talk. You have to learn to control your anger, alright? How come JOH is involved now! Oh, that? It was a decision from the top. Just cooperate with him. Sorry, but I can't. I won't work with that guy. You haven't had an easy time and so now you have help, alright? Forget about your pride! Learn to confront challenges, stop being chicken! Chicken? Me? When? You want some lunch? I can order right now. No, thanks! By the way, my teacher wants to meet you. Me, why? Well, my records say that you're my legal guardian! That's what you wrote on my file right, KANG? I apologize for having to call you in like this. Jane told me what happened, sir. She's just not used to the school yet... so... Please understand, sir. What's this? It's a small token of appreciation... I apologize. I should've come to see you early. Wait a second! There was a time when I dreamed about being a police officer... So I know how this works. Take it back now, or I'll have to report this to the police. You're violating Para 1, Art. 133 of the Criminal code. Do you really know what's going on with her at school? She's been involved in gang fights, and beaten the leader to a pulp! What? Yourjob was to watch and befriend her, instead, what do you do? Your old habits just came right out! But they wouldn't leave me alone. They picked on me! You should've let it go! I told you, I didn't want to do this! Listen carefully. This isn't your uncle speaking. It's your boss. Whatever happens, don't forget you're an officer, 'cause you're one. If your reckless behavior jeopardizes this mission, you're out! All right, I won't complain about JOH anymore. That's not enough. You need to get serious... Follow his orders no matter what. Whatever they are. Uncle! You know what I'm gonna say, so just do it or quit! Once a dog is pushed to the point of death, it becomes a meek slave. - You know what to do. - Yes, sir. In business, without betting money, you won't earn a thing. It's the same with dogfights. - Feed the dog. - Yes, sir. Any news from CHA? Well, I'm still... in the process of moving on it, sir. This is CHA's dauther. I got a better idea! What about using her! We could torture the hell out of her, then she'll talk. You are worse than the dogs. I should feed the dogs with you. Remember, I do business with dignity! Watch your mouth, or I'll rip it off. Sorry, sir. I told you to plant a man at her school. It's done sir, we have someone good working for us. Good, it'll be my wild card, to make sure we don't miss. Don't ever ease up, stay alert! Police Bingo! Turn left at the corner. Move. My investigation concludes that... BAE must have gotten KANG, who's CHA's right hand. I bet, 'cause we're getting closer to them and CHA is still missing. How about giving up on Seung-hee... And launch an all out attack on the Whacker Gang? It's not like we couldn't do that! But it's just not an option! We can't beat them that way. I'm sure their next target is Seung-hee. It's time to tell her the truth and put her under protective custody. It sounds like you want to give up the mission. Look, detective JOH! I'm not thinking about giving up... but while undercover I can't guarantee her safety! I don't think they're after Seung-hee. If so, they could've gotten her earlier. Just a small slit up could ruin everything and BAE'll walk! But I can'tjust sit back and watch, knowing she's a target! A little advice, don't allow your emotions to interfere with work. Just like you did with Hammer! - What...? - Jane! Jane, you keep an eye on her. Detective JOH, get evidence of KANG being held by BAE. And me, sir? Damn! Hey, KANG! You know how much I wanted to get Hammer, right? Of course, you didn't even hesitate to offer to be sold to the Japanese! - What? - Sorry. And JOH just slyly slid right in when everything was perfectly in place. That wasn't his intention, so don't take it personal. I know that. But then why is that bastard playing his game again? At least he did make out good by finding CHA's right hand! He was quick on the move. Just admit it. Shit, so you're on his side now, right? There aren't any good cops or bad cops. We're all on the same side! Choose, him or me? Which is it! On your side, period! Alright! Cheers! Ah...! What the hell! Got you! What do you think you are doing here? What's even worse, is that you're in a forbidden... Who the hell are you? - Well... Um... I'm... - Be off, man! - I'm OFF, sir. - You're... what? Come here. Can you imagine what went on here? It was just an hour ago... My loving student was cheerfully drinking with an older man. As her teacher, I feel responsible and helpless... You can't imagine... I've lost face to your dad up in heaven. Drinking during an assignment? You constantly cause trouble! I'm sorry. You're too emotional. That's why you're always one step behind JOH. Do you get it? I'll do better, uncle. I mean... sir. Gosh. Oh sweetie, I've never seen a cuter dog than you, my precious. Cheer up! You look so down, it's not like you! All right. What's this? It's money for your expenses. I have money. Take it. Uncle...! Think about your health and please quit smoking. Thanks. Good night. So-young. I saw everything, and it's okay. You saw what? You don't have to pretend to be something you're not. I hate guilt, but never the person who's guilty. Hey, don't get the wrong idea, that man and I... See you. Hey, So-young. Hi! Hey, you smell like alcohol! I drank. Is there a problem? - Jane... - Yeah? To be honest... I... Never mind. - What? - Nothing. - Go ahead inside. - Alright. Good night. - Good night. - Bye. Uh... I'll be up late reading. Oh, okay. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. You know where CHA is hiding out, don't you? I don't know, bastard! Are you gonna stick me in the gut to see if I'm lying? Yeah? My personal surgery is always the last measure, it's so messy! I like clean jobs. You still don't understand my work ethics, do you? Negotiation is the foremost way, kid! I don't care about your fucking work ethics! I gave him everything and this is how he thanks me! I want you to go tell that rat that... I put my one of my top dogs on his daughter. He'll get the message! Come on! I've decided to trust you. But remember, I'm gonna be keeping an eye on you, got it? Yes, sir. Don't look so down. The world is not over. Hey, take your time! I heard the rumor. Seung-hee! Whatever So-young said about me, it's not what you're thinking... It must be hard to deal with your dad's death, but it's not the solution. - What? - I completely understand. I used to think of doing crazy things 'cause of how I felt about my dad, too. Let's be friends. Sure. You wanted to see me, sir. Yes, come here. I needed some more info about you and called your previous school, and... they told me that you immigrated here. Is it a problem? Well, no, but I need to get some things straight. You know, academic records. My parents are still in Japan. I came back to Korea alone to finish my schooling here. Can I ask why you came back to Korea alone? I'm Korean, that's why. Is there any need for more explanation? No-young! What did the music teacher say? That I should be ready for the exam. What... exam? Don't you know that we have am exam tomorrow? I'm ready to stay up all night to study not to lose my top to you. Exam? Tomorrow? Who's in charge of Math? It's me. 1 for question number 19. 4 for 20. 3 for number 21. 1 for 22. Wait a minute. Number 26 isn't a multi choice. - Pass. - Pass? Pass? All about Crime Investigation Hold on, he's working on it. Then what's the next one? Siir... Quiet, you see! I'm working on it! What kind of nut would put these questions on a test? I feel sorry for these poor kids. This is way too hard. I told you that I trust you. And I made it clear you need to meet my expectations, right? Hey, what's with you? Come here. What's this about? Give it here! What the... cheating? Come with me! Sir, let's just move on to number 27. Let me focus on my job! I'm almost there! I even don't use a pen to solve these, but this one is so tough... Is this the way you return my love and trust? I don't believe you did this. Let me explain something, sir... You committed a crime, and got caught in the act. What's there to explain? Sir, calm down and listen to me. It's not what it looks like. Ouch. Okay, I'll give a chance to defend yourself. Go ahead. Well, the truth is that... I'm not the student on the file. What? I'm a police detective, undercover, on an assignment. You're killing me! Call your uncle to come to school. Now! Wait, how did you get here so fast? She's telling the truth. We're detectives. Who is it? Who is it? Hey, Seung-hee! Are you free? Yeah. Come in. I'm not saying I don't understand your side of it, but he's your dad. It's family, so nothing's unforgivable. It's easier said than done. So you won't leave the country? I don't know. I'm terrible, aren't I? No you are not. You pray for your dad every night. He knows how much you love him. How do you know I pray for him every night? It's what everybody does, right? Pray for their families! But you're lucky to even have your dad. I miss my dad in heaven! Let's pray for our fathers. Jane. Yeah? It hurts so much. My heart aches so bad. Why are you crying? I asked you to pray, not to cry. Damn! The more you cry, the more I feel like drinking. There he is! Jane, you did a greatjob! What's wrong? It feels like I am betraying a good friend. That's why ourjob is so tough. If Seung-hee shows up, she's your responsibility. Please, don't come, Seung-hee. Huh? What's this? Keep my last butt. I quit smoking just like you wanted. If I try to smoke again, threaten me with that. You don't really have to. I quit. I want to live long, and see you walk down the aisle, have a baby. Alright, it's show time, Detective JOH! Ready to go, sir. Detective KANG! All set, sir. KANG, JOH! Get him! It's him, CHA! What are you doing? Stop! Move it! Hey, it's been a fucking long time. Jellyfish, long time no see! Stop! I said, stop! You son of a bitch! You could've hurt innocent people. You fucking psycho! - Hey! - What the...! Shut your fucking mouth! Or I'll kill you. No-young! Hey, No-young! Open the door. You trying to break the door down? What's wrong? Where did you come from? - Grocery store. - Why? I was hungry, you know. Were you home all day? Are you examining me or something? You got a warrant? Where did your watch go? I took it off in the shower. Why, did you wanna get it fixed for me? I'd be unhappy if you lost that watch. Make sure you hang on to it. - What's this? - The real No-young. No-young? The real No-young emigrated to Japan and now lives there. - Emigrated? - That means... No-young is posing like a studentjust like you. Do me a favor. Keep this between the two of us, all right? What're you going to do? Hey, Jane! We're going to have sparring practice. Any volunteers? No-young, get up here. And his opponent...? Me, sir. Detective, remember he's just a student. Ready, begin! You're so good! Who the hell are you? What about you? I got your stupid broken watch! Why do you have my watch? Just fess up! I'm giving you 24 hours to get out of here. When I see you again, I'll throw you in jail. Please forgive me. - Seung-hee! - Forgive What? I've been lying to you. What are you talking about? To tell you the truth... I'm a police officer. My assignment was to get your dad through you. I don't believe you. Police, miss. Your father has asked us to keep you safe, in return for his testimony. I don't want to be protected by the police. Jane, I'll forgive you under one condition... just leave me alone. Uncle... Come on in. It's just for 2 days. I'm sorry for this. I'm doing this for my dad, so it's alright. So, it's you? Is he all right? What happened? They got him. KANG, where're we going? Hey! I'm sorry, Jane. I need the money for my wife's medical expenses. What? Jane! Damn! - Seung-hee! - Get off! The Whaker's second boss. CHA Young-jae! Kneel down! I thought meeting you was the luckiest thing to happen to me. Why? We've shared joy and sorrow, pleasure and hungerjust like families... And we've accomplished everything together. Dad. Seung-hee... Shut the fuck up! Put it away! I don't want her hurt, she used to be like family to me. Okay, let's do it, man to man. If I win, you and your daughter's lives are mine. If you win, you're undisputedly the Whacker's number 1 man. This is the last gift of love, I'll give you out of friendship. I look cool, don't I? Don't I look like a real mob boss? - Do I? - Yes, sir! You don't always have to agree with me. No-young? What a shame! I've been away from the action too long... Let's finish this, boss. Wow, it really hurts. Dad! Dad! Dad! The good news is that you won't feel a thing... But you will feel the pain. So, you'd better die before that. Dad! Dad, Dad, Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad, Dad! I love you, Seung-hee. I love you, Dad. Freeze, Police! Don't move. Unbelievable! I got a question, you're a thug anyways, right? Is this the right time for such a question? You're the most mysterious bastard. Look who's talking. Shoot, bitch! No, I won't. Come on! Dad, Dad! You bitch! Seung-hee, are you all right? Jane...! You go after BAE, I'll take care of this. - Sorry, sir! - You idiot! Don't leave even a cent behind! Yes, sir! Let's go. Sir, don't...! - Damn! - Stop the car. You have the right to remain silent... Hey, rookie, I told you this was my case. What are you going to do about it? I'll give you whatever you want, double the usual. Double that! You son of a bitch! Deal! He said deal! You make me sick. Are you joking? Put your gun away! I might kill you if you don't. You still don't get the picture, do you, rookie? You'll be the one who is dead. Like your uncle. What? What did you say? So, it's you? Someone's gotten in! Move! Shoot! It takes a lot of guts to kill someone. Rookie, can you do it? Shoot me in the count of three, or I will. One... Two... Fuck! Keep my last butt. Just like you wanted. I want to live long... and see you walk down the aisle, have a baby. You son of a bitch! Why? You worthless piece of shit! Tell me, why him? Detective CHUN! Get up! Calm down! I'll kill this bastard! Let me go! Let me go! Get up! You son of a bitch. Could we slow down? How is he? He's all right. The injury wasn't fatal. What a relief! Thanks Jane. Your dad's gonna be all right. You! You back stabbing son of a bitch. You fucking dirty dog! Let me go! You! All I can say is that I'm sorry. You're the worst kind of rat, you know that? You call yourself a cop? Captain CHUN has regained consciousness. Thank you. Here is the report, sir. Hey, Detective KIM, come here. So are we on undercover here? You see, the suspect is on a move.
