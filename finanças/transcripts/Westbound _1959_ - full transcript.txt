SORRY, SIR, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU. COLONEL VANCE IS EXPECTING YOU. GO RIGHT IN. COLONEL. COME IN, HAYES. SHAKE HANDS WITH JIM FULLER. MR. FULLER. MY PLEASURE, CAPTAIN. WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE LINE? A WAR. JIM HERE IS THE ASSISTANT POSTMASTER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU WERE LINE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE OVERLAND STAGE LINES BEFORE THE WAR, I BELIEVE. THAT'S RIGHT. I WON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH -- WE'VE GOT A SITUATION, AND WE THINK YOU'RE THE MAN TO HANDLE IT. YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO RENDER A GREAT SERVICE TO YOUR COUNTRY. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THESE YET? JUST ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT. I'VE SEEN 'EM. THE HOLDER OF ANY OF THESE NOTES CAN PRESENT IT AT ANY BANK, AND REDEEM IT FOR ITS EQUIVALENT IN GOLD. TO PRESERVE ITS CREDIT, THE GOVERNMENT MUST, AT ALL TIMES, HAVE THE GOLD IN ITS MINT TO BACK IT UP... GOLD FROM CALIFORNIA. UP TO NOW, THERE'S BEEN NO SCHEDULE FOR BRINGING GOLD IN, BUT THE ISSUANCE OF PAPER MONEY WILL CHANGE ALL OF THAT. WE NEED GOLD TO FIGHT THE WAR. WE NEED AS MUCH AS WE CAN GET AND AS FAST AS WE CAN GET IT, AND THE OVERLAND STAGES ARE GOING TO BRING IT IN FOR US. THERE'LL BE OTHER CONVEYORS, BUT OVERLAND WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF IT. AND WE WANT YOU TO TAKE OVER YOUR OLD JOB -- TO RUN THE OVERLAND STAGE LINES. I RESPECT MY GOVERNMENT'S WISHES -- MY APOLOGIES, SIR -- BUT I DON'T WANT THE JOB. YOU'RE THE BEST CAVALRY OFFICER IN MY COMMAND, JOHN, BUT THERE'S NO MAN IN COMBAT THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED. I THINK YOU SHOULD GO WHERE YOU'RE NEEDED MOST. THERE ARE MANY GOOD MEN THAT CAN RUN A STAGE LINE, SIR. WE'RE SUBSIDIZING OVERLAND WITH $1.5 MILLION DOLLARS TO HIKE THE SCHEDULE FROM A WEEKLY TO A DAILY RUN. IT'LL MEAN 60 MORE CONCORD STAGES, 2,000 MORE HORSES AND MULES, THOUSANDS OF TONS OF HAY AND GRAIN. I'D APPRECIATE THE NAMES OF A FEW MEN YOU THINK CAN OPERATE THAT SIZE LINE. THAT'S THE SITUATION WE'RE IN. 2,000 MILES -- 1,700 THROUGH THE WORST TERRITORY IN THE COUNTRY -- COUNTRY THAT'S NOT EVEN A STATE YET. YOU KNOW THERE'LL BE BREAKDOWNS, BANDITS, INDIANS -- YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT THE CONFEDERATES WANT THAT GOLD AS BAD AS WE DO. A DAILY SCHEDULE... I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT. WE THINK YOU CAN. WHERE WOULD I OPERATE FROM? MAIN OFFICE -- ATCHISON. YOU'LL WORK OUT OF JULESBERG. IT WOULD BE JULESBERG. PRETTY ROUGH RIDING, SIR. I'VE RIDDEN WORSE. YOU'RE JOHN HAYES, AREN'T YOU? I WAS A MESSENGER FOR OVERLAND WHEN YOU WERE LINE BOSS. I'M ROD MILLER, 7th REGIMENT, 3rd DIVISION, INFANTRY. HOW IS CAPTAIN GRACE? FINE, SIR, WHEN I LAST SAW HIM. HE'S A STUFFED SHIRT. YOU CAN SAY IT -- I CAN'T. YOU WEREN'T A MESSENGER WHEN YOU JOINED THE ARMY. NO, A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR THAT, SIR. I LEFT OVERLAND WHEN I GOT MARRIED. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HER PICTURE. WE GOT A FARM JUST OUTSIDE OF JULESBERG. PRETTY. PRETTY? SHE'S THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE TERRITORY. EXCEPTIN' ONE, MAYBE. YOU HOME ON FURLOUGH? FURLOUGH? I GUESS YOU MIGHT CALL IT THAT... A LONG FURLOUGH. GANGRENE. TOO BAD. WHOA! WHOA! 10-MINUTE STOP, FOLKS! WITH ANY LUCK, WE'LL BE IN JULESBERG TOMORROW MORNING. YOU'LL BE THERE. I UNDERSTAND THEY GOT A GOOD MAN RUNNIN' THIS PLACE. I'LL LET YOU KNOW AFTER I DRINK HIS COFFEE. YOU BETTER EAT IF YOU'RE HUNGRY. SUPPER'S A 4-HOUR RIDE FROM HERE, AND BESIDES, I COOKED THIS PIE MYSELF. WHAT KIND IS IT? WELL, I NEVER WAS ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT. I'LL TAKE A PIECE. I'LL HAVE SOME, TOO. COFFEE? GOT ANY MORE OF THAT PIE? SURE! SURE... HOW ABOUT YOU, MISTER? I'LL STICK WITH THE COFFEE. I'LL FIX THAT YANKEE. GOOD COFFEE. THERE YOU ARE, SOLDIER. THANKS. HEY, THIS PIE HAS BEEN SALTED. SALTED? HOW'S YOURS? Man: MINE'S FINE. Woman: DELICIOUS. YOURS? WONDERFUL. HEY! ANYTHING WRONG? THERE'S SALT IN THIS PIE. WELL, NO ONE ELSE IS COMPLAININ'. WELL, NO ONE ELSE GOT THE SALT. SOLDIER, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DON'T EAT IT! JUST PAY UP AND GET OUT! SUPPOSE HE DOESN'T? THEN I'LL TAKE IT OUT OF HIS HIDE, BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT PIE. THEN YOU EAT IT. THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS! I SAID, "YOU EAT IT." YOU BETTER EAT IT, WILLIS. NO MAN TELLS ME WHAT TO DO. HE CAN -- HE'S JOHN HAYES, YOUR NEW LINE BOSS. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL OF IT. [ GULPS ] COME ON, ROD. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS THE MATTER WITH HIM? COME ON, FOLKS! LET'S GET GOIN'! THINKING OF TOMORROW? I HAVEN'T SEEN JEANNIE IN MOST OF 18 MONTHS. THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE AWAY FROM HOME. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MR. HAYES? I DON'T WANT PITY. DON'T LOOK FOR IT. YOU GOT ANY FAMILY? NO. MAYBE SOMETIMES THAT'S THE BEST WAY. I WOULDN'T KNOW. WHOA. WHOA! [ HOOFBEATS ] Rod: JEANNIE! ROD! OH, ROD, I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER GET HOME! [ CRYING ] GOT TO GET MOVIN', SOLDIER. HERE'S YOUR BAG. Rod: JUST THROW IT DOWN. HONEY, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET SOMEONE. THIS IS JEANNIE, MR. HAYES. HELLO, JEANNIE. JOHN HAYES? THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, EVERYBODY IN JULESBERG KNOWS YOU'RE COMING. Driver: READY TO GO, BOSS? ANYTIME. GOOD LUCK. YOU COME AND SEE US WHEN YOU GET FIXED UP. THAT'S OUR PLACE. THANKS, I WILL. HELLO, MR. MILLER. HELLO, MRS. MILLER. LET'S GO HOME. HERE SHE COMES. Driver: WHOA! WHOA, WHOA! THIS HERE IS JULESBERG, FOLKS -- 2-HOUR STOP. STOCKTENDER! STOCKTENDER! IF I GET MY HANDS ON THAT STOCKTENDER, I'LL -- HEY... THE OVERLAND STAGE SIGN IS MISSIN'. SOMETHIN' IS WRONG. FOLKS, THERE'S A CAFE ACROSS THE STREET. YOU CAN WASH AND EAT THERE. WE'LL PICK YOU UP LATER. LOOK AFTER THE HORSES. I'LL SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. SURE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIGN? OVERLAND? MOVED OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. WHERE'D THEY GO? I WOULDN'T KNOW. IS PUTNAM HERE? YOUR NAME HAYES? TRY THAT DOOR OVER THERE. I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. I SORT OF GOT THAT IDEA. YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED. YOU HAVE. WELL, I'VE MADE A LITTLE MONEY. I OWN THE HOTEL AND SOME OTHER THINGS. I GUESS IT'S GOIN' ALL RIGHT. TELL ME ABOUT THAT LATER. WHERE'S THE OVERLAND STATION? WELL, I WROTE A LETTER RESIGNING AS OVERLAND'S AGENT ABOUT A WEEK AGO. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE IS NO STA-- NOBODY GOT YOUR LETTER. I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME. I NEEDED THE ROOM HERE. RECORDS, SUPPLIES, AND HORSES -- WHERE DO I FIND THEM? I WROTE THE MAIN OFFICE ABOUT THAT, TOO -- THEY'RE GONE. A COUPLE OF STOCKTENDERS LIT OUT WITH THE HORSES AND SUPPLIES AND BURNED THE RECORDS. THE TERRITORIAL MARSHAL IS WORKING ON IT NOW. BOOTING THE SCHEDULE UP TO DAILY RUNS -- THAT MUST BE QUITE A JOB. THE WAY YOU HANDLE THINGS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT ANY EASIER. THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES. JOHN! YOU KNOW I MARRIED NORMA. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, CLAY? WHAT HAPPENED? YOU HEAR ABOUT THE STOCKTENDERS STEALIN' THE HORSES? I HEARD. I BRUNG THE STAGE AROUND TO A COUPLE OF STABLES -- FULL UP...AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME. I HEAR PUTNAM'S OUT, TOO. YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING. OH, AND ANOTHER THING -- LOGAN, WILSON, AND PINES QUIT. YOU GOT NO DRIVERS. I GOT YOU -- OR YOU QUITTING, TOO? WELL, ALL MUSCLE AND NO BRAIN -- SURE, I'LL STICK. HOW MANY PASSENGERS ARE GOING ON TO SALT LAKE? ALL OF 'EM. THEN WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE. YOU TAKE THE STAGE ON TO CROWN POINT AND PICK UP YOUR RELIEF DRIVER THERE. I'LL NEED SOME FEED FOR THE HORSES. ALL RIGHT, GET IT. THAT BUNCH ON THE PORCH -- YOU KNOW 'EM? SURE. THEM'S PUTNAM'S BOYS. THE ONE IN THE ROCKER WITH THE BLACK HAT -- HE'S MACE. HE RUNS THINGS FOR PUTNAM. HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PRICE ON HIS HEAD IN THREE STATES. THEY GIVE HIM PLENTY OF ROOM AROUND THIS TOWN. CLAY PUTNAM DOESN'T NEED ANYBODY TO FIGHT HIS BATTLES. AS RICH AS HE IS, HE CAN AFFORD TO HIRE SOMEONE TO KEEP HIS NOSE CLEAN. YOUR NAME MACE? YOU SAID IT RIGHT. MINE IS JOHN HAYES. GLAD TO KNOW YOU. Mace: MISTER! TURN AROUND. LIFT UP THOSE SKIRTS. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT UNDER THERE. UP! WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO FORGET IT -- THE NAME'S MACE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHOA! OH, HELLO, MACE. AFTERNOON, MA'AM. I, UH, THOUGHT I'D DRIVE INTO TOWN AND PICK UP MY HUSBAND. SOME MEN ARE JUST BORN LUCKY. RUSS, TELL MR. PUTNAM HIS -- MR. PUTNAM ALREADY KNOWS. HELLO, DEAR. HELLO. WILL YOU BE NEEDING US FOR ANYTHING? NOTHIN' I CAN THINK OF. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. JOHN! THAT WASN'T NECESSARY, CLAY. YOU KNEW JOHN WAS ON HIS WAY BACK. THIS TRIP TO PICK ME UP WASN'T NECESSARY EITHER. I DON'T THINK THAT EVEN NEEDS AN ANSWER. THAT'S A LOT OF WOMAN! EVER HEAR ANY OF US DISAGREEING...ABOUT THAT? WE'LL BUY THIS PLACE OR RENT IT -- YOU MAKE THE DEAL. IF THERE'S ANY SENSE TO IT, I'LL TAKE IT. JUST DROP 50 CENTS ON THE TABLE -- ON YOUR WAY OUT! Man: TAKE YOUR SOLDIER BOY HOME, LADY. Man #2: NO-GOOD BLUEBELLY! WE DON'T LIKE THE COLOR OF THAT SUIT, MISTER. IT'S TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T SHOOT YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF THAT ARM. Man: STAY OUT OF JULESBERG! THAT GOES FOR ME, TOO, YOU NO-GOOD YANKEE! SO YOU'S A NORTHERN SOLDIER, IS YOU? DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION, ROD. THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY WANT. Man: WE DON'T WANT NO YANKEE-LOVER AROUND HERE. THAT'S A PRETTY OUTFIT YOU GOT ON, DRUMMER BOY. YOUR MAMA BUY IT FOR YOU? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT A LOUD MOUTH, BUT I DON'T SEE NO GRAY ON YOU! COME ON, ROD. IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHAT YOU SEE -- WHAT WE SEE IS WHO WEARS THE PANTS IN YOUR FAMILY. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE DRUMMER BOY'S SUIT OFF. YOU'RE A BRAVE BUNCH! YOU'RE SCARED OF NOTHING AS LONG AS YOU'RE FIGHTING ONE MAN! YOU MEAN HALF A MAN, DON'T YOU? HE'S A LOT MORE MAN THAN YOU'LL EVER BE! WELL, I'LL SURE BE AROUND ANYTIME YOU'D LIKE TO FIND OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GONNA HAVE MORE TROUBLE WITH HER THAN I AM WITH HIM! Hayes: ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN. LET HIM GO. ANOTHER BLUECOAT... OR IS IT YELLOW? FRIEND OF YOURS? WAS ONCE. THROW HIM IN THE WATER TROUGH. MY APOLOGIES, MA'AM. WHEN HE COMES TO, I'LL BEAT A LITTLE SENSE INTO HIM MYSELF. I THINK MR. HAYES HAS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THAT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, MA'AM. I'M GONNA BEAT HIM FOR LOSIN' THE FIGHT. [ SPLASH ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHING ] CLAY, I'M TELLIN' YOU -- SHE RARED BACK AND "POW"! YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN RUSS'S FACE! YOU ALREADY TOLD ME. SO? SO, THE LAST TIME I SAW HAYES, HE WAS RIDIN' OFF WITH THOSE TWO KIDS. I WISH NONE OF THIS HAD HAPPENED. HAYES HAD NO FRIENDS IN THIS TOWN -- NOW HE'S GOT TWO. WHAT CAN THEY DO FOR HIM? PROBABLY NOTHING. MY POINT IS IT JUST WASN'T NECESSARY. I STILL SAY WE SHOULD LET OVERLAND OPERATE AND GIVE HAYES ALL THE ROPE HE NEEDS TO HANG HIMSELF. WE COULD HAVE PICKED THOSE STAGES OFF ONE BY ONE. I'LL TELL YOU AGAIN -- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HIM. NEVER SAW A MAN I COULDN'T HANDLE. I WON'T ARGUE THE POINT. WE'VE ALREADY HACKED AT OVERLAND'S ROUTES HERE. THE THING TO DO NOW IS MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SPROUT AGAIN. EASY WAY TO DO THAT IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE. HOW'S THAT? GET RID OF HAYES. IF WE DO THAT, WE HAVE EVERY UNION SOLDIER IN THIS TERRITORY ON OUR NECKS. OUR JOB IS TO SEE THAT GOLD DOESN'T GET THROUGH TO FIGHT THE SOUTH. NOTHING MORE... NOTHING LESS. MEANING? MEANING WE'LL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER SHORT OF BLOODSHED TO STOP HAYES AND THE LINE -- WRECK HIS STATIONS, RUN OFF HIS ANIMALS, BURN HIS BARNS AND HIS FEED. THAT'S THE HARD WAY, AIN'T IT? THAT'S THE ONLY WAY. I STILL SAY WE OUGHT TO KILL HAYES. GET OUT. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE GREW UP WITH ME -- KNOWN ME SINCE I WAS A KID... YELLIN' AT ME AND CALLIN' ME NAMES LIKE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR. EVEN IN THE LINES, WE NEVER HATED THE MEN WE WERE FIGHTIN'. WE BELIEVED ONE THING, AND THEY BELIEVED SOMETHIN' ELSE. THEY WERE ON ONE SIDE AND WE WERE ON ANOTHER. BUT WHY SHOULD THEY HATE ME HERE? THIS AIN'T EVEN A STATE YET. IN THE LINES, YOU CAN HEAR A MAN CRY WHEN SOMETHING RIPS INTO HIM. SEE HIM DIE, AND IT'S COMMON PAIN AND MISERY -- NO MATTER WHICH SIDE HE'S ON. PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHO ARE OUT OF IT. THEY -- THEY GET HURT BY SEEING FRIENDS AND KIN DYING, AND IT'S THE OTHER SIDE THAT DID IT. IT GOES BOTH WAYS. MAYBE. [ GUN RATTLES ] MORE COFFEE? IF IT'S LIKE THE LAST, BETTER JUST LEAVE THE POT. WHY, THANK YOU, SIR. ROD? HONEY, YOU SIT DOWN. LET ME DO THINGS. [ CRASH ] THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE CLEANED UP. I CAN PUT ON A FRESH POT. HALF A MAN! THAT'S NO LIE! OH, ROD! I'VE BEEN HOME ONE DAY, AND ALREADY I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TRYING TO RUN A FARM WITH ONE HAND. WE'LL DO ALL RIGHT. YEAH, SURE -- WITH YOU DOIN' ALL THE WORK! HOW ABOUT RUNNING A STAGE STATION? THINK YOU CAN DO THAT? SURE. SURE. WHERE'S THE STATION? RIGHT HERE. OVERLAND WILL USE YOUR HOUSE AND BARN, BUILD A CORRAL AND BUNKHOUSE. YOU'LL GET PAID FOR ANY CHANGES AND RENTAL, BESIDES YOUR WAGES. BUT WHAT ABOUT PUTNAM? PUTNAM QUIT. WE MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE FROM HIM. WHY WOULD PUTNAM WANT TO MAKE TROUBLE IF HE QUIT? BECAUSE HE'S A SOUTHERNER. WE'RE CHANGING TO A DAILY RUN. IT'LL BE A LOT OF WORK, BUT THAT ISN'T ALL -- THOSE STAGES WILL BE CARRYING GOLD FOR THE UNION TREASURY FROM SACRAMENTO. AND YOU THINK HE'LL TRY TO GET THAT GOLD? IF HE CAN'T STOP US FROM RUNNIN'. JULESBERG IS MOSTLY REBEL NOW. YOU, UM, SAW THAT THIS MORNING. THEY WON'T SELL TO US. I'LL HAVE TO BRING IN EVERYTHING WE NEED -- EVEN DRIVERS. PLENTY OF FARMERS AROUND HERE WERE UNION WHEN I LEFT. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET SUPPLIES FROM THEM. HOW ABOUT HORSES? ROD WILL GET HORSES IF HE HAS TO TAKE THEM OFF THE PLOW. I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE BOYS TO HELP ME PUT UP A CORRAL -- AND A BUNKHOUSE, TOO. YOU SLEEP ON IT. I'LL GO HAVE A LOOK OUTSIDE. WELL, WAIT -- I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND. [ GUN COCKS ] HEY... HEY! COME ON -- I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE WE CAN BUILD THE CORRAL, AND THE BUNKHOUSE OUT HERE. Hayes: WHAT ABOUT WATER? [ HORSE NEIGHS ] [ NEIGHING CONTINUES ] JUST AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT, JEANNIE. I AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT. JUST HALF A MAN. LISTEN -- IT DOESN'T MAKE A MAN ANY LESS BECAUSE HE LOST SOMETHING FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. COME ON IN THE HOUSE. I'LL FIX US SOME BREAKFAST. [ GUNSHOTS ] HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! [ HOOFBEATS ] YOU'RE TWO DAYS LATE! DID YOU SEE THE INSIDE OF THIS STATION? YOU SAW ME COME OUT. EVERY STATION FROM HERE TO DAWSON IS THE SAME. I'VE BEEN RIDIN' FOR TWO DAYS WITH THESE SAME HORSES. I HAD TO STOP TO FEED AND REST 'EM. THANKS. YOU'LL DRAW A BONUS FOR THAT. I'LL DRIVE THE STAGE IN. YOU CAN REST. I CAN USE IT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT THE STATIONS? KEEP GOING WITH NEW MEN AND EQUIPMENT. YOU BETTER SEE THAT THE MEN HAVE PLENTY OF BULLETS. KIRK WHO RUNS DAWSON TOLD ME SOMEONE TRIED TO BURN HIS PLACE DOWN AND STEAL HIS HORSES, BUT HE SCARED 'EM OFF. MY BONES ARE STIFF FROM RIDIN'! WHEN DO WE GET OUT OF THIS BOX? PRETTY SOON. NOW, LET'S NOT HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM YOU. WE GOT ENOUGH ALREADY. WE GOT A STATION IN JULESBERG YET? YEAH -- MILLERS' FARM. HYAH! ROD! HI, HONEY! WE ALWAYS CAN USE SOME COFFEE. HEY, BILL! PULL THAT WAGON OVER THERE BEHIND THE WELL! COFFEE? COFFEE? COFFEE? ROD! NEW BUNKHOUSE AND CORRAL -- IT'S NOT HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A CHEAP LITTLE RANCH NEEDS THEM FOR. YEAH, AND ALL THEM HORSES. JUST MIGHT BE FOR HAULIN' STAGES. YEAH, THEY SURE GOT 'EM -- MEN AND HORSES -- PLENTY OF BOTH. RECOGNIZE ANY OF 'EM? JUST TWO OF 'EM -- ANDERSON AND ANOTHER -- I THINK HIS NAME WAS BAUMEISTER. FARMERS! YANKEE HOTHEADS! THE MILLER KID HAS COLLECTED EVERY UNION SYMPATHIZER IN THESE PARTS FOR HAYES, THANKS TO THE LIKES OF YOU. SODBUSTERS -- ALL OF 'EM! YEAH, WELL, WHEN ONE OF 'EM HOLDS A SHOTGUN IN YOUR FACE, YOU TELL HIM THAT. I STILL OWE THAT MILLER KID AND HAYES A GOOD GOIN' OVER. Hayes: HYAH! HYAH! Hayes: HYAH! YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR MAIL AT MILLERS' FARM. HYAH! HYAH! WH-O-O-OA! ROD, JEANNIE. HI. HI. HO! ONE-HOUR STOP -- ALL OUT. I HOPE WE GET SOMETHING DECENT TO EAT HERE. WE DO THE BEST WE CAN, SIR. GO RIGHT ON IN. WASH 'EM DOWN AND SEE THAT THEY GET PLENTY OF REST. THEY EARNED IT. EAT UP AND PICK YOURSELF A PLACE IN THE BUNKHOUSE. YOU CAN SLEEP FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. MUCH OBLIGED FOR THE SHORT NAP. AND LOOK AFTER MY HORSE. THE HORSES LOOK LIKE THEY'VE BEEN TRAVELING A LOT FURTHER THAN CROWN POINT. SINCE DAWSON. THE STATIONS ARE THERE AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL. I'LL NEED MEN, HORSES, AND FEED. I'VE BEEN RIDIN' AROUND SEEIN' FARMERS. YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF HANDS TILL HARVEST. THAT'S TIME ENOUGH TO GET ROLLIN'. TELL 'EM TO BRING GUNS AND WATCH OUT FOR HORSE THIEVES. AND I'D BE CAREFUL ABOUT RIDIN' AROUND THE COUNTRY. WHY? YOU EXPECTING TROUBLE? WE ALREADY GOT IT. WHO'S TAKIN' THE E@ATBOUND? Man: I AM! GOT ANY OBJECTIONS? YOU SURE ARE SCRAPIN' 'EM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS OLD RELIC? RELIC?! I WAS DRIVIN' STAGES WHEN YOU WAS STILL IN SWADDLIN' PANTS! AND I CAN STILL OUTDRIVE YOU! ANY MAN'S BEEN AROUND THAT LONG HAS GOT TO BE DEAD! YOU SURE THIS AIN'T OLD CHRISTY'S GRANDSON? [ LAUGHS ] I WAS A WHIP WITH OVERLAND WHEN JOHN FIRST COME TO WORK FOR THE LINE. HE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT KNOWIN' YOU -- JUST SHOWED UP THIS MORNING AND ASKED IF WE COULD USE A DRIVER. GOT ME A SMALL FARM DOWN A PIECE. I HEARD ABOUT YOUR SITUATION, AND I FIGURED YOU COULD USE A DRIVER. HOW'S THE WAGES? BAD DEAL ALL AROUND. DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE'LL BE A MANAGER NEXT RELIEF STATION. WELL, IF THERE AIN'T, JUST GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE. IF THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' THERE, JUST GO ON TO THE NEXT. JUST LIKE WHEN I FIRST STARTED! 15 YEARS AGO. 20! AND I RUN A PONY EXPRESS BEFORE THAT! WELL, DO I GET THE JOB OR DON'T I? YOUR FOOD'S ON. COMIN'. YOU GOT IT. JUST SHOW BACK IN ONE PIECE. HEE HEE HEE. SAME ORNERY CUSS! AIN'T CHANGED D BIT IN 10 YEARS! HEE HEE HEE! SAY, HOW DO YOU DRIVE ONE OF THEM THINGS? THOUGHT YOU'D BE ASLEEP BY NOW. ROD'S ASLEEP. I DECIDED TO CATCH UP ON SOME SEWING. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? I PUT ANOTHER MAN ON TO WATCH THE HORSES. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ROD -- AND FOR ME, TOO. IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND -- I SHOULD BE THANKING BOTH OF YOU. MR. HAYES, THEY SAY A WAR MAKES A MAN GROW UP FAST, BUT IN A LOT OF WAYS, ROD'S STILL A BOY. THINGS HAVE ALWAYS HURT HIM EASIER THAN MOST, AND STAYED WITH HIM LONGER, TOO. AND NOW HE JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT LOSING AN ARM COULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WITH US. HE KEEPS SAYING HE'S HALF A MAN. I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME, BUT...I THINK THAT... YOUR LETTING US RUN THIS STATION IS ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT'S GONNA MAKE HIM FORGET WHAT'S HAPPENED. Rod: JEANNIE? JEANNIE? GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. YOU GOIN' SOMEPLACE? I'M QUITTIN'. YOU CAN'T STOP ME FROM LEAVIN'. NOBODY'S STOPPIN' YOU AFTER YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HORSES. STOCKTENDERS STOLE 'EM. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. ALL RIGHT, SHOOT HIM. BE GLAD TO. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. I AIN'T DONE NOTHIN'. YOU CAN'T KILL ME. GO AHEAD -- BLOW HIS HEAD OFF! WAIT A MINUTE, MR. HAYES! I'LL DO ANYTHING! YOU CAN'T KILL ME. I WON'T ASK YOU A SECOND TIME -- WHO TOOK THE HORSES? IT WAS LOGAN, WILSON, AND A COUPLE OTHERS I NEVER SEEN. WAS ONE OF 'EM CALLED RUSS? YEAH, RUSS -- THAT WAS IT! I HEARD ONE OF 'EM SAY IT. WHERE DID THEY TAKE THE HORSES? WING CANYON. THEY'RE ALL THERE. THAT THERE RUSS -- HE'S GONNA DRIVE 'EM SOUTH IN A COUPLE DAYS. WHO GETS 'EM? HE'S SUPPOSED TO TURN 'EM OVER FOR DELIVERY TO CONFEDERATE CAVALRY, BUT I THINK HE'S GONNA SELL 'EM. YOU KNOW SOMETHIN'? YEAH? MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO GET OUT OF HERE -- QUICK! YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. [ GRUNTS ] COME ON, BOY! [ LAUGHS ] LOOK AT HIM GO! [ THUNDER CRASHES ] DON'T SEE ANYBODY. NO. HERE WE GO. HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! [ GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ] DO YOU KNOW IT'S 10 MILES BACK TO TOWN? IT'S CLOSER TO 11! YOU LOOKIN' FOR SOMEBODY, MISTER? YOUR BOSS. HE AIN'T HERE. HIS HORSE? MRS. PUTNAM'S. OH...I'LL WAIT. Norma: IT'S ALL RIGHT, ED. YES, MA'AM. I'M EXPECTING CLAY ANY MINUTE. WON'T YOU COME IN? I DON'T THINK CLAY WOULD APPRECIATE FINDIN' ME IN HIS HOUSE. IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO. HELLO, JOHN. NORMA. YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL FOR YOURSELF. [ LAUGHS ] I GUESS I HAVE. IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, ISN'T IT? IN MOST WAYS. IT WAS YOUR CHOICE. WHY DIDN'T YOU WRITE TO ME? WOULD IT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE? IT MIGHT HAVE. MY BAD LUCK. I'M GLAD I GOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, JOHN. WE'RE STILL FRIENDS. YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS WILL BE. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU WERE EXPECTING COMPANY. I CAME HERE TO SEE YOU. WELL, I SUPPOSE IF YOU WANTED TO MEET NORMA, YOU WOULDN'T DO IT IN MY OWN HOUSE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? BETTER SAID BETWEEN US. THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT ME NORMA DOESN'T KNOW. THAT'S RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, I'VE JUST COME FROM WING CANYON. WE'VE GOT OUR HORSES BACK. YOU'LL BE HEARING IT FROM YOUR MEN PRETTY SOON. I'LL MAKE THIS SHORT -- THE STAGES ARE GOING TO RUN. YOU AND NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO STOP THEM. YOU MAY STOP ONE, OR MAYBE TWO, AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL. THERE'S ENOUGH BLOOD RUNNING ON THE BATTLEFIELDS WITHOUT STARTING HERE, BUT WE'LL PLAY IT ANY WAY YOU WANT IT -- IT'S UP TO YOU. HAYES, HOW MANY OF YOU DID IT TAKE TO GET THOSE HORSES? TWO -- ME AND THE ONE-ARMED BOY. I WARNED YOU ABOUT UNDERESTIMATING HIM. ANYTIME HAYES WANTS TO FACE-OFF WITH ME, HE CAN DO IT, I DON'T WANT BLOOD SPILLED ANY MORE THAN JOHN. THAT GOLD ISN'T GOING INTO A UNION TREASURY WITHOUT A FIGHT FROM ME. I HAVE NO QUARREL WITH THAT. JUST REMEMBER YOU'RE FIGHTING THE UNION. YOU KEEP YOUR PURCHASES IN THIS ROW AND CHECK THEM AGAINST WHAT WE SEND THE OTHER STATIONS. THAT WAY YOU'LL ALWAYS KEEP A RECORD OF IT. HOW'S THAT SEEM TO YOU, JOHN? HMM? REASONABLE. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE AS MUCH OF A BOOKKEEPER AS I AM. ALL I KNOW IS I'M GLAD WE'VE GOT ROD AROUND. WELL, IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE ROUNDS. STAY WHERE YOU ARE -- I'LL DO IT. POUR YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE. HOW ABOUT YOU, JEANNIE? NO, THANKS, I'M FULL UP TO HERE. [ GUNSHOT ] AAHHHHH! [ MEN SHOUTING ] [ GUNSHOT ] WHEN YOU BRING IN THE HORSES, PUT HIM ON HIS AND CART HIM BACK TO TOWN. [ JEANNIE SOBBING ] I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S ALIVE. HE'S ALIVE. NOTHING WORKS FOR HIM. THAT SHOT WAS MEANT FOR ME. LET'S GET HIM TO BED. [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] WELL, WE GOT REAL TROUBLE. Shhh! Russ is dead. Rod Miller is probably the same by now. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? AFTER HAYES TOOK THE HORSES, RUSS TALKED SOME OF THE BOYS INTO GOIN' BACK AFTER 'EM. THEY WAITED TILL NIGHT. NOBODY FIGURED RUSS WOULD DO ANY SHOOTIN'. HE TRIED TO GET HAYES -- SHOT THE KID INSTEAD. HAYES PICKED HIM OFF. IF HE HADN'T, I WOULD HAVE. THAT'S IN THE FIRE NOW. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THIS BREAK OUT INTO OPEN KILLING. I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR FACE. YOU GOTTA MAKE UP YOUR MIND. DO YOU WANT OVERLAND STOPPED OR NOT? THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN A CAT. SURE...BUT YOU EVER TRY TO SKIN A LIVE CAT? THE MAN'S GONNA GET PRETTY SKINNED UP HIMSELF. YOU CAN'T PLAY A GENTLEMEN, CLAY, AND DO WHAT YOU WANT DONE. I COULD HAVE...ONCE. NOT ANYMORE, THANKS TO YOU AND RUSS. YOU ALREADY HAVE THE FARMERS AGAINST US, SO KEEP THIS DOWN. ANYONE THAT WANTS TROUBLE WILL GET IT. DON'T GO LOOKIN' FOR IT! I'M NOT RUSS! I'LL WAIT FOR HAYES TO COME TO ME! GOOD NIGHT. DOCTOR, LET ME HEAR THE TRUTH. HE HASN'T GOT A CHANCE. LOOK, MR. HAYES, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF JULESBERG AFTER ALL THAT'S HAPPENED TO THAT BOY. IT'S TRUE THAT WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SOUTH, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT WE DON'T SYMPATHIZE WITH CLAY PUTNAM AND HIS KIND. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH, MR. HAYES. WHENEVER YOU GET READY TO MAKE YOUR MOVE, WE'LL ALL BE BEHIND YOU. THANKS, DOCTOR, BUT THIS IS MY FIGHT. SHE'S GOT A LOT OF NERVE -- COMIN' HERE. HOW IS HE? NO BETTER. MAY I COME IN? HE'S SLEEPING. NO POINT IN YOU COMING IN. YOU KNOW I'M NOT YOUR ENEMY... NOR YOURS. YOUR HUSBAND IS. YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THAT. JOHN, STAY OUT OF JULESBERG. MACE IS WAITING TO KILL YOU. JOHN, BE SENSIBLE! MACE IS A PROFESSIONAL KILLER! THANKS FOR TELLING ME. [ ROD MOANS ] [ MOANS ] I THINK YOU'D BETTER GO. HOW'S IT GOIN'? THEY'RE ALL READY TO ROLL! WELL, LET'S GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE! COME ON, FOLKS! LET'S GO! I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE, LITTLE HONEY! COME ON! LET'S GO! COULDN'T WE WAIT FOR THE NEXT COACH? WHY? THE LITTLE GIRL! LET'S GO! HYAH! [ GUNSHOTS ] HYAH! HYAH! [ GUNSHOTS ] AAHHH! THEY'RE GAINING! AAHHH! AAHHH! AAHHH! Mace: LET'S GO DOWN THERE AND GET THE GOLD! GO TELL MR. HAYES. Man: HOW'S THE BOY? NOT SO GOOD. YOU TAKIN' CROWN POINT? HANKS AND CROWN POINT. TELL 'EM THE NEW STAGES WILL BE COMIN' THROUGH NEXT WEEK. YES, SIR. AND TELL 'EM TO BE CAREFUL -- YOU, TOO! YES, SIR! STUBBY. BOSS. MR. HAYES! MR. HAYES! MR. HAYES! EVERYBODY'S DEAD! THE STAGECOACH WRECKED! QUIET DOWN, SON! TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. EVERYBODY'S DEAD. LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. ALL THOSE PEOPLE DEAD... THAT LITTLE GIRL. WE DIDN'T FIGURE IT'D BE QUITE THAT BAD. STAGECOACH ROBBED... DEAD PASSENGERS LOOTED... SCAVENGERS! EVERYONE LOOKS OUT FOR HIMSELF. I BLAME MYSELF. TROUBLE WITH YOU, CLAY, IS THAT YOU'RE RICH ENOUGH TO BE AN HONORABLE MAN. I CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND TO THINK THIS HAPPENED IN THE NAME OF THE CONFEDERACY! WHETHER THE SOUTH WINS OR LOSES MEANS NOTHIN' TO ME. NEVER HAS. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THATCUM LIKE YOU COULD NEVER PUT ANYTHING ABOVE YOURSELVES! I WANT YOU OUT OF JULESBERG! MATTER OF FACT, ME AND THE BOYS ARE STAYIN' FOR MORE OF THAT UNION GOLD COMIN' THROUGH. YOU GET OUT OF JULESBERG BEFORE I KILL YOU. KILL ME? I DON'T THINK SO. [ Laughing ] I DON'T THINK SO AT ALL. I'VE HANDLED 2-BIT GUNSLINGERS LIKE YOU BEFORE. NO POINT YOU AND ME FALLIN' OUT, CLAY. I'M STILL GONNA STOP OVERLAND, AND I'M KILLIN' HAY-- I DON'T WANT YOU FOR ANYTHING! SUIT YOURSELF. YOU JUST MIGHT ASK YOUR WIFE WHAT SHE WAS DOIN' VISITIN' HAYES THIS MORNIN'. TAKE HIM ON INTO TOWN. I'LL BE ALONG LATER. JOHN... HE'S DEAD. [ SOBBING ] [ SIGHS ] I'VE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER, CLAY. I CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU ANY LONGER. I'M LEAVING YOU IN THE MORNING. WELL, I -- I CAN'T STOP YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANT. IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT. IT'S WHAT YOU'RE FORCING ME INTO DOING. YOU'RE BLAMING ME FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STAGECOACH AND THE MILLER BOY. YES, I TOLD YOU BEFORE -- SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS! YOU KNOW, IT JUST DOESN'T FIT YOU! WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT AND SAY WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT! I UNDERSTAND YOU. YOU NEVER WORRIED ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE BESIDES YOURSELF IN THE WHOLE OF YOUR LIFE... INCLUDING ME. [ SIGHS ] I WON'T LISTEN TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE LIKE THIS. I NEVER FOOLED MYSELF ABOUT THE REASON YOU MARRIED ME, EITHER. IT WASN'T FOR LOVE. ALL RIGHT, THEN -- AT FIRST THAT WAS SO -- I WON'T DENY IT. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T! SEE, THAT'S THE TROUBLE -- I UNDERSTAND YOU. AND I STILL LOVE YOU. YOU'D NEVER BE LEAVING ME IF YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU HAD SOMEBODY ELSE TO GO TO. THAT'S NOT TRUE! YOU'RE A LIAR! LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND TELL ME THAT YOU'RE NOT STILL IN LOVE WITH HAYES. I TOLD YOU WHEN I MARRIED YOU THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH JOHN AND ME, BUT YOU'VE KEPT BRINGING HIM BETWEEN US. IT'S NOT JOHN HAYES THAT'S BREAKING US UP -- IT'S YOUR JEALOUSY! THEN YOU'VE GIVEN ME YOUR ANSWER? THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO SAY. EXCEPT THIS -- YOU WALK OUT OF THIS HOUSE, YOU GO OUT THE WAY YOU CAME IN -- WITH NOTHING BUT THE CLOTHES ON YOUR BACK. AND I WOULDN'T DEPEND ON GOING TO HAYES, EITHER, 'CAUSE MACE IS GONNA KILL HIM -- IF HE ALREADY HASN'T. I LOVE YOU, CLAY. I GUESS I KNOW I ALWAYS WILL. BUT IF YOU LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO JOHN HAYES, I SWEAR I'LL SEE YOU HANG. [ GLASS SHATTERS ] I gotta stop Mace... gotta stop him. [ GLASS SHATTERS ] [ GUNSHOTS ] ABOUT TIME HE GOT HERE. GET OUT THERE AND COVER ME. MACE! LOOK THIS WAY! I EXPECTED YOU A LITTLE EARLIER! I'M HERE. AND I'M COMIN' OUT! GO GET HIM! BACK OFF, MACE! [ GUNFIRE CONTINUES ] [ NEIGHS ] I NEVER HAD IT FIGURED THIS WAY. I HAD TO STOP MACE. JOHN, TAKE CARE OF NORMA. I INTEND TO. WHOA! WHOA! HOW ARE THINGS IN JULESBERG? BETTER. THAT'S GOOD. Driver: HERE WE GO! HYAH! HYAH! WHAT ABOUT MRS. PUTNAM? NORMA'S GOING BACK EAST TO LIVE. WE JUST SAID GOODBYE. OH. I, UH, I'M GOING TO MOVE YOUR STATION BACK TO JULESBERG. I WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT. I CAN STILL RUN IT. I THINK YOU COULD AT THAT. I KNOW I COULD... WITH A LITTLE HELP. WELL, SEEIN' AS HOW THIS IS STILL GONNA BE AN OVERLAND SWING STATION, I'LL DROP BY AND LOOK IN ON YOU FROM TIME TO TIME... IF YOU DON'T MIND. I'LL MAKE IT SOON. SOON.
