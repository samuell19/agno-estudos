In other news, authorities are still investigating a suspicious fire at the Abernathy State Mental hospital. Although one unidentified body has been recovered from the ashes, several staff and high-security patients remain unaccounted for and it is not clear if they all perished in the fire or if some of the inmates may have escaped from the burning building. Not bad, huh? It's going to be the jewel of the neighborhood when we're done. I still say it's kinda creepy. Oh, come on. It's gonna be fun fixing it up. And it's even closer to your school. I can sleep in an extra five minutes. Whoo hoo. You're welcome. Hello? - Hi, I'm Frank. - Hi, I'm Maggie. I see you bought the old place. Yes. It's a beauty. Gonna need a lot of work though. Mom? Mom is that you? Hello? - Oh my. - Geez. No more coffee for you. You all right? Yeah, I'm just a little light headed. That was quite the scare you gave me. Why don't you sit down for a second? Mom, I'm fine. I think I just freaked myself out. I heard noises. It's an old house. They do that. You'll get used to it. I still don't get why we had to move, especially to an old house in the same town. Sometimes it's good to have a fresh start, make new memories. You say that like the old ones are bad. Oh no, baby. They're not bad. They're just... A lot. Looks like you've already started on your room and you are still holding onto that old music box. - Does it even play anymore? Not really, but I don't want to get rid of it. Are you sure you're all right? Yep. Never better. Come on. Let's get all this unpacking over with. Guess I'm moving out. Man. Ah. Oh. My dear sweet Alex. I'm watching over you. Please, don't scream. Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you. I could never hurt you. My name is Albert. Albert Beck. I'm a surg... I was a surgeon, one of the best in the world. So, don't you worry. I know how beautiful life is, how precious. What are you doing here? I saw the place was empty and I didn't have any place to stay. The last hospital I was at, I was cured, So I left. It was all just a big misunderstanding. I just needed them... I needed them to love me. My poor Albert. So sweet. Who couldn't love you? I won't tell. Morning sweetie. Morning. I'm leaving in a minute of you want a ride to school. Scott's picking me up. One of the perks of moving closer, right? Well, have a good day. Tell Scott I said hi. Bye mom. Morning, beautiful. Hey. You all right? Yeah, it's nothing. All right, come on. I'm so glad you called. This house is creepy as hell and I'm all alone because Mom went to some real estate thing. So, how's the unpacking going? Endless. You never realize how much stuff you have until you have to pack and then unpack it. It mean it's a good thing this house is so big. I need three rooms just to hold... Hey, what's up? This house makes the weirdest noises. It's haunted, it's definitely haunted. Yeah, that's what I told my mom. Babe, are you okay? I'm just gonna get some water. I'll call you back in a few. Okay babe, love you. Oh no. Oh no. Okay. Pulse is weak. Irregular heartbeat. 911, what is your emergency? I need an ambulance, 721 Charaday Lane. I have an 18 year old female she's having cardiac... I have a girl who's passed out. I don't know what's wrong though. Please send somebody. Ambulance is on the way. What is your name, sir? Nope. Okay. Hang in there, beautiful. Help's on the way. Paging Dr. Stavan, Dr. Stavan please. All nurses to the nursing station. Paging Dr. Bender, paging Dr. Bender, please. Mrs. Newell? Yes, Doctor. Your daughter is doing just fine. The surgery went very well. We installed a pacemaker, but that's just a temporary fix for her condition. Her condition? Alex is suffering from the same cardiac degeneration as her father had. I'm afraid that she's gonna need a heart transplant And I can't stress enough that time is of the essence. Within six months, maybe sooner. Alex also has one of the rarest blood types. Finding a suitable donor is gonna be extremely challenging. Oh God, I can't... I can't lose my baby girl. We're gonna do everything we can to help her. Come on, let's see if she's awake. Okay. Wow. Dr. Bender to the mental ward please. Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender, Paging Dr. Bender. You're very lucky the paramedics got there when they did. There could have been some serious damage. I guess I have you to thank for that. I didn't call. I don't understand. If you didn't call, then who did? Maybe a good Samaritan walking by, heard your cry for help. I don't remember doing that, but it's still kinda fuzzy, so I... If it were me I'd count my blessings and pay it forward. Now Alex's pacemaker is wireless so we can keep track of any abnormalities in case they occur. However, that means bedrest, minor activity. We don't want to worsen your condition. I added Alex's name to the transplant list. So I'll keep you involved as it develops. In the meantime, I recommend hiring an at-home nurse to keep an eye on her, help out. We can't count on the good Samaritan being there again. Okay. I'll have the nurses leave a referral. - Thank you. - In the meantime, she should get some rest. You had quite a day. I'll check in on you later. Are you okay, baby? Do you need anything? Mom, nothing's gonna happen. I'm exhausted. Try and get some sleep then. I love you, baby. I'll bring your homework by tomorrow. Bye baby. Love you. See ya. It's okay, she's gonna be all right. An at-home nurse. Paging Dr. Stavan, Dr. Stavan please. It's clear now this was meant to be. Me choosing your home, meeting you, And you needing a new heart. I'll get you that heart, Alex. I'll even do the surgery myself... to prove how much I love you. Sleep well, beautiful. Dr. Beck will take care of everything. Chris McCoy. Oh, uh... No. What are you doing in my house? Is your name Chris? Who the hell are you? I'm from Midhaven General. I'm here to notify you there's been a misunderstanding regarding your referral. The family won't be needing your services so I'm here to take your place. Ow. Man on man. You did that to yourself. Oh. Hi. I didn't know anyone else was here. I'm a friend of Chris'. You know, she had an accident. She tripped, she fell. You scared me, you dummy. Hello, this is Chris McCoy. This is Maggie Newell. Hello, Mrs. Newell. - Hi. - Yeah, the hospital said you might be calling. Are you available? - Yes ma'am. - Tomorrow? - Available. - Noon? Yes ma'am. Wow. It's what the hospital recommended. Just to make sure you're okay. Lucky me. You know, I've always wanted... whatever that is. That must be the nurse. You mean my babysitter? Alex, play nice. - Okay. - I'll be right back. Why don't you sit down? I'm fine. Really, go. Maggie. I'm nurse McCoy. But you can call me Chris. Oh, hi. Sorry. I just, well I wasn't expecting... That's all right, I've heard it all before. But experience only comes with time, right? That's true. Please, come in. I'd love to. What a lovely home. Oh, thank you. Still have a lot of work to do. You're renovating. Yeah. I adore these old Victorians, kinda my thing. Saving places like this. You ever heard of St Agatha's? No. It's an old hospital on the outskirts of town. Been abandoned for years. Our company just purchased it and I'm renovating that too. Turning it into a recreation center. Nice. Let me introduce you to Alex. Mmhmm. Alex, this is Nurse McCoy. Please, call me Chris. Okay, Nurse Chris. So the hospital said you had quite the scare. Yeah, but they patched me back up. I actually feel pretty good right now. I know what you're thinking, that a beautiful young woman like yourself does not need a babysitter. So, think of me as your personal physician, as if you're a big time celebrity and I'm on your staff. Okay, Doc. I'll need my hand back eventually. Just checking your pulse. All good. You're so lucky your mom found you when you collapsed. Oh, actually I didn't. Apparently I have a mystery stalker who called 911. Stalker? Sounds more like you have a guardian angel watching over you. Maybe it was Dad. Well, I should go. - But... - I promise you, she is in excellent hands. Okay. I'll be back. Call me if you need anything. - Okay, love you. - Love you. Please. So this must be sentimental. Let me guess, first boyfriend. No, my dad actually. It reminds me of him. Oh, I can't think of a better reason to hang on to it. Just because something's broken does not mean it should be discarded. Let's check out your equipment and set up your app, huh? Okay. Hey there. Morning, neighbor. How's it going? Hi. Frank, right? I couldn't help, but notice your security camera. Yeah, we had some trouble with mail theft a while back. It's motion activated. Really? How long does it store footage? This app gives me live updates on your pacemaker. That way I'll be alerted if ever anything goes wrong. Also, it has GPS. So it keeps track of you if you sleep walk. You don't sleep walk, do ya? No. So, I'm basically a human GPS. Just to keep you safe. All right, I'm need to check your incision, make sure everything looks good. Tell me if anything hurts. It's just sore. Completely normal. Means you're healing. Look at me. I'm such a freak. Hardly. The scar will fade. Okay. All done. Okay. How about some tea? I make a mean chamomile. Sure. That sounds good. 'Kay. Oh, those are lovely. Yeah. They were in my hospital room with no card. I guess my boyfriend sent them Well, whoever sent them, they think you're very special. It doesn't make sense. There must have been a late night jogger or a dog Walker. You saw it. There was no one. So who called 911? Maybe someone heard it from the backyard. Why would someone be in my backyard? And at that time of night? We'll spend the day together, have some lunch. Maybe go for a walk. Hi? I'm Scott, Alex's boyfriend. You must be the nurse. Yeah, hi, I'm Chris McCoy. Shouldn't you be in school? Yeah, they gave me early release so I can bring Alex her homework. Oh, well, Alex is resting. It's not a good time for a visitor. Well, we've been texting all day, so she knows I'm coming. Okay then. I was just taking her tea and biscuits. Yeah, cool. Let's do it. Son of a... Hey, I thought I heard your voice. What's up? How you feeling? - Hi. - I missed you. Here's your tea. - Thank you. - Mmhmm. And thank you for the flowers. They're beautiful. Flowers? - Yeah. - They were from you, right? Yeah, of course. No, they should've left the card. There's, there wasn't a card? Nuh uh. Huh, so lame. Well, they really made my day. I'm glad. - You're the best. - I love you. I love you too. You liar! Liar, liar, liar. I brought her the flowers. I got those flowers for her. I left 'em for you. It was me. - It's so hard. - It's not hard. All right, so Mr. Sanders gave us so much homework. Oh my gosh, I swear he likes to torture us. - Yeah, definitely. - Alex. You need to rest. I know, but I'm so bored. Just like an hour, please? Okay. One hour. - Thank you. - Trust me, bro. I can get her anything she needs. All right, so we have an entire chapter due. I'll go downstairs, then? Yeah, please do. What the heck is a logarithm anyway? Oh beats me. I never understood this stuff anyway. Okay, so we have an entire chapter due by Tuesday. I think we're both in trouble here. Oh man. Oh yeah, oh yeah. This will do perfectly. Dr. Beck to the ER. Dr. Beck, you're needed in the ER. Dr. Beck to the ER, urgent. Dr. Beck to the ER, Dr. Beck to the ER. Dr. Beck, you're needed in the ER. Hi, Dr. Beck. Hello, darling. You're still the greatest heart doctor in the world. I know. There you are. Got outta your room again I see. No. I would love to talk to you, but I'm needed in surgery. Stop! Time for your electrotherapy. Electrotherapy. I'm cured. I don't see fake people anymore. Like that guy, especially that guy in the hat and Hawaiian shirt. I never see him. Oh, but you do, Dr. Beck. You see fake people all the time. No, no, no, no. What do you think I am? A fake person? Yeah. You are so funny. Get the hell outta my hospital! Oh man. AB negative. Hello. Benedict, John H, 52. Heart disease? Pass. Daniels, Mary age 46 diabetes and chronic smoker. You're supposed to treat your body like a temple, not a temple of doom. We only want the best. Here we go, Carlisle, Patrick, age 42, no family history of disease. Put him in the folder. And moving on, Matthews, Gail, age 35, non smoker, no underlying disease. She might be just what the doctor ordered. So to speak. Let's look her up. She got a dating profile. Hey, kinda sexy. Don't be jealous. You have nothing to worry about. A woman her age'd never work out for me. She's active. I like that. She keeps herself in shape, that's for sure. In to beer. Good thing you don't need her liver. All in all, I think we might have a winner. Let's say hello. Saw your profile, would love to meet you in person. Hoping I can steal... your heart. Too much? Maybe Albert Beck hasn't lost his charm. Oh, I didn't realize you were here. Sorry to scare ya. It's okay. I'm running late. I'll see you later. Alex will be down in a minute. She's just having a shower. Wow. Thank you. You really don't have to do all of this. Don't be silly. The fastest way to heal is to keep your strength up. Looks like someone's got a secret admirer. No, no. I just enjoy... Your phone. Looks like you've got plans with a special someone tonight. Oh, that. "Looking forward to meeting you tonight." Followed by lots of heart emojis and a few others. It's nothing. Just a first date. So, any news on your good Samaritan? No. Now my mom's thinking someone saw me from the backyard. Why would anyone be back here? Well maybe they saw you from there and they didn't want to seem like a peeping Tom. So why leave their name? Maybe. I just wish I knew who it was so I could thank them. Yeah. What would you say? - I'd thank them for noticing me. - Mmhmm. You know they had no idea who I was and they still cared enough to help me. That's unconditional. Like it was with my dad. Like your dad. Wow. What else? I'd tell them that they have no reason to be afraid to come forward and reveal who they are. You know, maybe... maybe they did something in the past but it doesn't matter 'cause they still have a really good heart. They proved that by caring about someone they didn't even know. Right. Alex, I um... What? Oh, it's Scott. Hey. Yeah I know, I want to go. Of course it is. - Whoo. - Whoo is right. So tell me about you, Chris. Oh, not much to tell. I'm in the medical profession. A doctor! Well a nurse, actually. A male nurse. You don't see too many of those. Oh, we're more common than you think. So, tell me about you. Divorced, kids? Never married. So, no in the kids department, that I know of. My family's on the other coast. So it's just me doing my own thing. No baggage. That is so refreshing to hear. I'm the same. Look Chris, you seem like the type of guy who goes after what he wants. Oh I am. I'm the same way. I'm not one for wasting time. When I want something, I go get it. That scares a lot of guys off. Probably the reason I'm still single. Probably. So, what do you say we cut through all this pre-foreplay crap and get to the good stuff? Your place or mine? Definitely mine. You okay? Mom, I'm fine. Goodnight, baby. If you need anything, just give a shout. Okay, I love you. I love you. Cute place. Thank you. A little bit more feminine than I expected from a single guy. Well, I am gonna redecorate. I just haven't had time what with work. What's in here? Oh, hold on a sec. Oh, uh... Uh huh. That's just for work. Kinky. Is she gonna join us? Why don't I make us a couple of drinks? You read my mind. Back in a sec. Baby, are you sure about this? Yeah, come on. Let's go. Okay. Cheers! Oh, yeah. - Salud. - Thank you. - Ha! - Whoo! Whoo mama. - Come here. - Oh baby. Yeah. Let's lose some of these clothes. I'll take care of that. I'll take care of that. You first. Oh! Why do you carry handcuffs? Duh. All cops do, silly. Oo, what's this? Aw, I was just- I knew you were fun. You didn't tell me you were a cop. Detective actually. I don't mention it because the idea of a strong woman turns a lot of guys off. Right, right, right. But I didn't get that vibe from you. Actually I um... That's my phone. I have to, it could be a patient emergency. Thanks. It is a patient. It's an emergency. Heart rate is spiking. I'm sorry. I have to go. - I get it. - I'm sorry. I have to go. We'll take a rain check. Absolutely, we will. Don't for a second think you're getting away that easy. Oh baby. Alex. - Alex. - Hey come on. You can catch me if I faint. Oh, God. - Alex! - Hey, how are you? I miss you. We're going crazy tonight. Alex! Here. Thank you. What are you doing? - What? - I want to dance. - Alex! - Please. - Alex! - Come on. - You wanna do too much. - Just one night. We'll go slow, I promise. Slow, all right? I promise if you start spitting up, I'm done. I'm serious. Please. - Okay. - Okay. Is this a good pace? I like it. Maybe a little slower. This party's gonna be so dope. I can't wait. What is she doing? Man. So this is your song? Oh, so you wanna dance? Yeah. Oh you wanna. Oh okay. Yeah. No baby. You've got to slow down. No, no. No. Hello. Sorry to call so late but I'm getting some weird readings on Alex's pacemaker app. Weird how? Well the locations are all screwy, but can you check on her just so I know? Oh sure. Hang on. Alex? She's not here. So the app isn't broken? Where does it say she is? I'll go get her. What are you doing? What is this? I don't know what this is. All right. Okay well you're gonna go for it. I'm going. I mean time to go for it. Let's go, all right. Okay. Okay. - Okay, I'm gonna spin. - Ooh! Okay. Okay. Let's go. Mom, what are you doing here? Alex, I am not kidding. You let her do this? No ma'am. Not good. We'll talk about this at home. - Come on. - No, I'm staying here. Baby, baby. Whoa, whoa. - Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. - Baby? Alex? Talk to me. - Baby. - I need to sit down. Okay. Irresponsible. All of you, you know this could kill her, right? Do you even care? Hi Chris. I just found her. Great. Look, I know you're probably really upset right now but we need to calm her down. Her heart rate is too high. So let her know you love her and everything's gonna be all right. And please get her some cold water. Maggie, I know you're pissed, but do it for Alex. Okay? Come on. Baby, you're gonna be okay. I'm sorry that I embarrassed you. I love you. Great job. That's better. I will meet you at the house. - Yeah. - You're okay. - I'm scared. - I know, baby. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. I just don't get it, Alex. What were you thinking? I just wanted to get out and have fun for like a few. Is that what you thought you were doing? 'Cause I'd say it's more like toying with your life. You could have passed out or worse. Why would you help her sneak out? No, I didn't... It's not Scott's fault. I was going with or without him. He just came to keep an eye on me. At least he didn't rat me out. Alex, I'm here to keep you safe. I don't understand. Are you trying to kill yourself? No! Then what? Explain it to me. It's my life. I don't want to live it like he did. You mean your dad? Look, if I'm gonna die, I just, I just want to live first, before... Alex, you are not going to die! Mom, a heart's not coming. Not in time. It's not. You just need to face it, like I have. I just want to use what time I have left. No matter how much or how little that may be. I'm not gonna spend it trapped in a bed like dad was. That's how I remember him. Sick, bed bound. Those are my last memories of him. Oh baby. Not the man that he was. And that's, that's not gonna be how I'm remembered. So, don't even think about checking me into a hospital. 'Cause I, I won't go. Alex, you can't give up hope. I'm not. But I'm not gonna pretend either. I'm just facing reality. Maybe you should, too. Well, I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed. Here, let me help. Don't. Scott can help me. Goodnight, baby. Oh, oh, everything is gonna be okay. She's right about her dad. Once he got into that bed he never came out, he just... withered. Oh my god. I'm gonna lose my baby girl. No, I won't... That's not gonna happen. I promise you. You can't. Even I can't. The odds of a donor popping up in time? One will. I've been doing this a long time. These things, these things have a way of working themselves out. Trust me. How can you be so sure? Let's just call it gut instinct. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Good morning. How are you feeling? Fine. Look... I know you're mad at me about last night, but my job is to keep you safe. And if that makes me the bad guy, then I'll wear that like a badge of honor. Just to make up for it... I brought you a little surprise. Oh my God. I know how much it meant to you. So, I got you a new one. I can't take this. You really shouldn't be buying me things. Oh no, yes, yes, no. I am here to help you heal. And in my experience patients do that faster when they're surrounded by things they love. You're gonna put yourself out of a job. Good as new. Just like you'll be soon. This is Maggie Newell. Hi, this is Grace from 911, following up on your inquiry. Oh yes. Thank you for getting back to me. I was just wondering if I could get some information on the night of my daughter's emergency. The call definitely came from your daughter's phone. The audio has been deleted but I was the dispatcher who took the call. Oh, you were? Great. Did you notice anything... unusual about my daughter's call? Your daughter wasn't the one who made the call, ma'am. It was a man. - A man? - Yes ma'am. Are you sure? Yes ma'am. He sounded older, whoever he was, he had medical knowledge. I hope that helps. Not really, but thank you for the information. - No problem. - Okay, bye. No, next week won't work. I need to see him as soon as possible. So sir, are you having dark thoughts? Am I having dark thoughts? - Yes. - Well, yes, actually, I am. How dark, exactly? Very dark. Which is why I need to speak to someone today. - End of the day? - End of the day is fine. - Okay. - Yeah. - 6:30? - 6:30 is perfect. - You're all set. - Thank you. Are you sure that this is a good idea? Why wouldn't it be? 'Cause he's a psychiatrist, they're trained to read people. What if he figures out what you're doing? I would just hate if anything happened to you because of me. That is so sweet, but everything's gonna be fine. He's a match. That's all that matters. It'll be fine. So Mr. Johnson, my service noted you were having violent thoughts. Sure. Sometimes. But I mean, don't we all? These thoughts about harming yourself or harming others? Others, definitely. But only when it's absolutely necessary. When is violence necessary? Sometimes you have to make sacrifices, you know? Sometimes you have to sacrifice for love, Doctor. Do you believe in love? True love. Unconditional. So there's a woman involved, or a man. A very special young woman. How young? Let's talk about you for a minute. Got any hobbies? Any sports you play to keep fit? I'm sensing a lot of conflict in you. - Conflict? - Mmhmm. - No. - It seems to stem from this young woman you mentioned. You know what you're doing is wrong. But your need to love so that you can be loved in return, drives you to do it anyway. I'm not a big fan of this psycho-babble stuff. You came for my help, yes? Well yes, absolutely. And I have no doubt that you can help me. It's just, I don't... I don't like people poking around in my head. You've been to therapy before. Once or twice. But let's just say it never quite worked out for me. What did you talk about with your previous therapist? Well, you know, the usual. Think good thoughts. Don't listen to the bad voices in your head. Voices? Tell me about the voices. There's nothing really to tell. I mean, they're just... voices. These voices ever appear to you? I mean, do you, do you ever see people who, um... are not really there? Come on, man. I'm not crazy. I just have an overactive imagination. Mr. Johnson, I'm concerned about you. I will prescribe you something for your anxiety. Thank you. But I do... Excuse me. I do think that we need to set up weekly meetings to discuss these voices. Just to make sure that these voices that you're hearing don't manifest into anything more physical. Doc, ya helped me already. Anxiety-free. Lucky me. Oh my god. Help! Buddy! Where ya going? Stay back. Stay back. Look, there's nowhere left to run. Be reasonable here. I can't have you damaging that heart. I need it. You're insane. That's a little judgmental of you, isn't it Doc? Judgmental, you want to hear judgmental? - Sure. - How about this? You're a hyper-neurotic, egotistical narcissistic freak. You deserve to be locked away forever. In fact, in fact, prepare to go to jail for the rest of your life, you son of a... Well that heart's no good. Man. The cause of the fire at the Abernathy state mental hospital is still under investigation, but authorities now strongly suspect that it was arson and that it was an inside job. So far the bodies of three people have been pulled from the rubble and positively identified as hospital staff. But several high security inmates are still missing - and it is not clear... - Oh God. If they perished in the fire or somehow managed to escape in the mayhem that followed. Good morning. So how's Alex today? She's tired. Says she feels weak. Scott's upstairs with her. Terrific. I have to make a stop on the way into work. Have you noticed anything odd around the house? Like signs of someone else being here? Someone else being here? No. What about in the neighborhood? Anyone who looks like they don't belong? Why do ask? Just wondering. I'll check in later. Okay. Okay. Hey! You fixed it! No. Nurse Chris bought me a new one. He bought that for you? Don't you think that's a little odd? I mean at first, yeah, but then he explained how it's like part of the healing process. How things that make you happy help you heal faster. You mean like me? I'd give you my heart if I could. If anything ever happens to me I want you to have it. See, we're the same blood type. We match. I mean, it's like we're meant to be together. Like it was fate. Alrighty, here we go. Nice! Same blood type. Fate indeed. Knock knock. Oh, Scott, hi. I didn't know you were here. Oh, hey man. Well, I made tea. You can have mine, Scott. I'm good. No, I insist. Plenty of herbs in this stuff. Good for everybody. Here you go pal. If you insist. Will you all excuse me for a second? - Mmhmm. - We'll be right here. - So Chris... - Mmhmm? Can I ask you something? Yes. You have a girlfriend? I do. Someone very special, if you must know. Oh yeah? So what's her name? Bésame el Trasero. - Spanish. - Something like that. Oh right. Make sure Alex drinks her tea. Will do, man. Scott? Scott! What's the matter? Chris! Nurse Chris! Hey, hey, wake up, hey, Scott. Scott wake up. Scott, Scott. You should have some more tea. What are you talking about? Something's wrong with Scott. We have to call an ambulance. Actually everything is just right. What are you talking about? Something's wrong with Scott! I can't wake him up. I know, that's because he's, he sedated. He'll be fine. What? I found it, Alex. I found your heart and it was right in front of me the whole time and I didn't even know it. What are you, what are you talking about? Scott! He's a match. I can save you again. Again? I was the one Alex. I was the one who found you that night. - I called 911. - You? Yeah, I was here in the attic. Yeah. I was watching from above. If I hadn't have been, you'd be dead. Don't you see, it was fate. I was meant to be here to save ya. Now with Scott I can save you again. Oh my god, you're crazy. Why do people keep saying that? Alex you've got to calm down. That's why I drugged your tea. So your heart wouldn't go crazy. Just trust me Alex. And you'll wake up with a brand new heart. Get away from me! Alex, Alex, Alex. I did it for us. I did it for us, Alex. Oh. Don't you worry. I'll fix everything. I need some help. I found that in my attic. One moment, please. I think someone was living in there, an escaped patient. Gotta call you back. I'm afraid they might be dangerous. Wait right here. Hi, I'm Detective Matthews. You said you found this in your attic? Yeah. Follow me. Nice and snug. Man oh man. Hate to be you. What's it say? It looks like this place got hit by a pretty bad fire. And now they're thinking it was arson, probably set by one of the patients. And it looks like a few of the inmates were unaccounted for. Hospital folks thought they must've burned up in the fire but I guess one of them got away and decided to squat at your place. Do you have photos of them? Let me see. What the f... Suspect should be considered extremely dangerous. If possible, let me take the bastard down. Come on Alex, answer. It's Alex, leave a message. Alex, it's Mom, where are you? Call me immediately. Nurse Chris isn't who he says he is. When you get this lock your bedroom door. We're on our way. Ready? Let's go. No, no, no, no. Please let me go. Untie me! Relax. Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. I've done this a million times. Oh my god, Scott! Scott, wake up! You've got to try to calm down. The strain is bad for you. Who are you? Name's Albert Beck, Dr. Albert Beck. And lucky for you, I'm on call tonight. Oh my God. Help! Someone help me. Help. Albert Beck, you're under arrest. - Alex? - Stop! - Alex? - Wait. She's not here. Oh God. Where could he have taken her? I might have an idea. What are the odds of a boy who already gave you his heart could literally give you his heart? No, stop! It's what Scott wanted. He said so. - No! - I know, he wasn't my first choice either. But the others, they didn't work out. The pacemaker isn't showing up. Oh come on, show me her signal. It's not working. I don't know why. He probably disabled it. Alex? They just found something at the McCoy home. Oh my god. Those are my daughter's clothes. I need all available units to St. Agatha's Hospital. Suspect is believed to be on location with one, possibly two hostages. Please don't hurt him. No, no, no, no. Please, please don't. But this is what you wanted. You asked me for it. So we could be together. What? I never said that. I never said that. He's here. All units, we have probable location of suspect. St. Agatha's Hos... Get back... Ms. Newell! There's always an element of tragedy to these things. One person loses their life so another can live. But it'll make for a great conversation with our kids one day, right? Scott! Now, I haven't done this in a while so I might be a little rusty. Speaking of a little rusty. Hmm. I'm begging you, please. Hopefully it's like riding a bike. Oh no. No, no, no, please! Please! Alex! It's Mom! Mom? Mom! Mom, help! Mom, I'm in here. Help! Mom! - Alex. - Help, I'm in here. Mom! Help! Mom! Don't you go anywhere. Scott? Scott wake up. Scott! Scott, Scott wake up. That's it! That's it! Come on. Albert Beck, come out with your hands up. Hey, hey, hey. Wake up, I need you to wake up, okay? Al. Wake up, wake up. We gotta go. We gotta go. Okay. Where were we? Oh no. Alex, come out, come out wherever you are. Alex! Alex! Where are ya? I'm your doctor. We have an appointment. Alex! Alex! Why are you running? Shh, shh. I'm doing this for you, for us. Alex, please. Alex, you need to stop. Your heart won't take much more. I just want to save you. Come on. Scott, I need your help. Hey, it looks like I saved you again. Get away from me. Don't touch me. Alex, stop fighting this. This is for you, all of it. Alex, I'm doing this because I love you. I don't love you. It's okay. I love you enough for the both of us. And when you have your new heart I know you'll see things differently. Listen Alex, now Scott can die for nothing or Scott can die for you. Take my hand. - Alex. - Alex! - Mom! - Oh baby. Oh, careful. You're okay. You're okay. The police are here. It's over. She's dying. Look at her. I can save her. I can save her. You'll have to kill me first. Oh come on. Okay. - Gail! - It's over, Beck. Hi, sexy. How 'bout that rain check? Both the hostages inside. Move, move, move! Hands up! Drop it! Not another step. Down on your knees, now! Officer down, officer down! Check over there. Clear. Clear. I need an ambulance to St. Agatha's Hospital on Highway 27. Officer down, critical condition. - I repeat, officer down. - Mom! Critical condition. Oh baby. Oh my god, Alex. Alex, hang on, baby. Somebody please, someone help. Hang on baby, hang on baby. Just relax. The doctor'll be here any minute. Everything's ready, Doctor. Please, please someone help me. Hello, Alex. No, no, no, no, no. Just a tad more anesthesia. Please someone help me. Yes, Doctor. Please, please someone help me. I could never hurt you Alex. I'm here to save you. Where is he? Where is he? Oh, be careful, baby. It's okay. You're safe. The surgeon, it was Beck. It was him. Oh no, baby. No, it wasn't. Mom yes, it was. I saw him. Alex, we've just been through hell and you're on a list of medication that is longer than... No, it was him. I saw him. It was Beck. Shh. Something wrong? No, no, no. The surgery was a huge success. Except... What? We just found. Dr. Courdier in the men's room, bound and unconscious. He didn't perform the transplant. Someone else did. I told you. It was Beck. He saved me just like he said he would. Everything's gonna be all right. He's gone now. Man. Yeah, like any of these guys are gonna give you a ride. Man. What the hell are you doing here, man? I got rid of you back in the asylum. I was on sabbatical. I mean, let's face it, man. We needed a break from each other. Well, I don't need you anymore. I'm cured. I'd hardly call what happened back there cured. Hey, hey, hey, where ya headed? Oh man. Here we go. Hey, can I have a ride? Well... sure. Come on in. Thanks, pal. I usually don't pick up hitchers but you seem like a decent fellow. Thank you. I got to say you're traveling awful light. Never seen a hitcher with no baggage. Oh, he's got baggage, plenty. I need a fresh new start. New place, new clothes, new me. Sounds like you got woman troubles. How'd you know? I've had mine too. Broken hearts are a bitch. Ain't they? They certainly are. Well, where are ya headed to? Anywhere but here. I've been there too, many times. Maybe give he can give you a lobotomy at the next stop. Shut up. Well, here we go. Ask him if he has a new teenage daughters.
