* Brooklyn: This is a story about the guy I fell for. But to really understand why, You have to know a little bit about the game he loves. The game has been played by native Americans For centuries. It requires speed and agility, Teamwork, strategy, And a bit of violence. You may know it as lacrosse, But native Americans know it as baaga'adowe... The little brother of war. Their matches took days And were played over Miles of terrain. The winners got land, wives, and sometimes glory. There's a lot that's different about the game now. But the thing a player needs most hasn't changed at all. And if you find someone who has it, I'd tell you to never let go. (Whistle blows, crowd cheers) (Overlapping shouts) Get it over there! Center it! Swing it! Watch his pass! (Shouting continues) (Whistle blows) (Shouting continues) (Whistle blows) Who's Jimmy's back-up? Hanson. We're in trouble. (Whistle blows) (Sportscast playing on radio) Hey, coach says he's having second thoughts. * You ready for this? I was born ready, bro. Whoa. A moment with my player, ref? Hansen's the backup, and I don't want to hear any arguments. I thought I was getting a second chance. You're arguing. There's a delay of game penalty with your name on it If I don't get a resolution A.S.A.P. I can win this. What's it gonna be, coach? (Whistle blows) We'll run a switchblade first, coach says. Yeah, sure. I mean it, man... Switchblade! Trying to win the game by yourself. My play is called "the iceman". I'm not talking about your play. Do it... switchblade. Bring us all in. You got no time for one shot, And I know wherever you're going. 15 seconds? All I need is 10. (Whistle blows) All right, go! Go! Go! Come on, Conor! Switchblade! Run switchblade! Conor, pass! Sullivan, that's not switchblade! (Cheering) Good job out there. Good job out there. Hey, Riggins. Hey, did that go in? I didn't see. Conor, man, let it go. Come on, fighting means suspension. That was wonderful. Yeah, nice, man. You should call your father. The only time he won't pick up Is when he's on patrol. He's okay. Dad calls that "being in the shit". Hey, Keegan! Top-key mushrooms. Maybe he didn't pick up Because his phone is turned off. Or maybe dad flew back early from Iraq To surprise his family. Dad, you're home! Ha ha ha! You're looking rather dashing, colonel Sullivan. As are you, Mrs. Sullivan. Perhaps I could escort you home after this. Perhaps you should. Heh! Aww. Perhaps I could escort you home right now. Easy, marine. Get a room. Ahh. So, how come you're home? I'm wondering the same thing. Can't a guy just slip away from the war Without his family thinking something's up? No. (Laughter) I got some news. I'll be right back. Where are you going? 30 minutes, Conor. Conor: I can win this. Dad: Other than the fact that you let 14 get inside your head, I thought you were ten tons of awesome. Why are we doing this, dad? You know why. We're gonna move again. Then they'll call you back, And it'll all be for what? Sorry, pal, that's the military life. Sometimes you gotta just suck it up, son. (Sighs) Conor... It's very important That you tone your attitude down here on and off the field. I had to pull some strings to get you in here. I want you to promise me that you'll show humility. Conor, you listening to me? Not really, dad. (Chuckles) Come on. He's really cute. Brooklyn: It's funny what you notice The first time you see someone... Confidence, a nice smile, A little connection. What you don't see... What's impossible to know at first glance... Is everything else. At least everything that counts. Hey, dad, how many of those are yours? That one. And my name is on that one. And that was taken right after the state championship. How many of those did you win? Four in a row. Four? Heh heh. All right. Hey, who's that one guy you always... Dave Milligan. You're about to meet him. Straighten your tie. He played on one of the best west coast teams ever. The kid scored 70 goals last year. Look, nobody plays varsity their first year. I can't bench somebody who's paid their dues. It wouldn't be fair. Since when are you a stickler for propriety? Why'd you bring him here? Because, despite our considerable differences, I know your reputation as a coach, And you turn out a hell of a lacrosse player. We play real lacrosse here, not that west coast field hockey. Just play him, see how he does. I'm not asking for favors. I'm doing you a favor just by giving him a look, And right now, that's all I can give you. Fair enough. (Indistinct chatter) Can I help you? Thanks, but I'm pretty good at dressing myself. No, varsity only here. Scrubs dress in there. So, you're what passes as varsity around here? Yeah. Heh. Awesome. Yo, skip, toss me a ball. Watch the ball. Sticks up, sticks up. Watch that throw. Watch the ball! Let's go! Great, guys. Keep the pace up. Stay focused. Really well done. Good, keep the ball moving. Oh, you're late, west coast. It's 4:00. If you're not early, you're late. You owe me a lap. Let's go, cradle it out. Sticks up. Keep your feet moving. Nice. Nicely done. Watch the ball. Get the energy up. Sticks up. You okay? Cradle it out. Sticks up. Sticks up! Sticks up! (Overlapping shouts) Come on, you can take him! (Grunting) (Laughs) You think you can do better, Sullivan? Only one way to find out. Switch up your Jersey to white. Coach, give me a whistle. You got it, coach. (Blows whistle) Braveheart, give me Bryant! Let's go (Overlapping shouts) Bryant, Sullivan, let's go! Anytime today, Sullivan! Here we go! Joe's gonna crush you. One-on-one, go on my whistle. First one to score wins. It's that simple. Got it? Down. Keep it clean. Good luck, brother. I'm not your brother. Oh, we're all brothers in lacrosse, west coast. (Whistle blows) Come on! Come on, west coast! (Grunting) No, no, no, no! Hey! Yeah! (Cheering) You should've shot when you had the chance. Yeah, I guess so. Welcome to Briarfield, Sullivan. Conor. Conor. Hey, come on, wake up. Dad? Is the house on fire? No, it's morning. No, it isn't. It's close enough. Let's go. (Laughing and grunting) Not bad, not bad. (Cell phone rings) Hang on a sec. I gotta take this call. Sullivan. Morning, general. Yes, sir. Right. Okay. Thank you, sir. What was that about? Nothing. Just some advisory work they want me to do. That it? Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about it. Let's go. Okay. Keep your arms extended, this side. Let's see what you got. Go. (Grunting) Oh, nice, nice. Except you gotta learn how to shoot. Who's gonna pick up a guy who shoots like a drunk woman? Huh? Come on. * Brooklyn: There are a bunch of ways to find out about someone. You can watch them around other people, Find out what their interests are, How they react to new circumstances. Sometimes, if you really want to know, It's easiest to just talk to them yourself. Hey. Hey. Hey yourself, newbie. Name's Conor Sullivan. Brooklyn... Milligan. Ahem. (Mutters) Coach's daughter. Ahem. (Laughs) So, my dad says you come out here To practice every day at 5 A.M. Oh, does he? He does. Does that make you wonder how your dad knows that? Because it sure makes me wonder. (Laughs) Hey, Joe, think fast! Ha ha! Hey, babe. Hey. Hey, this is my girlfriend Charlie. Hey. Hey. Um... We should probably get back to practice. Yeah. See you later. Bye. See you later. See you later. Nothing's hotter than chicks with sticks. Nothing. Just doesn't sound right. I didn't mean it that way. (Overlapping shouts) Gotta watch the pick! Ohh. (Grunts) This kid can play. He most definitely can play. So, what do you think? You want to move him up? We'll see where he is in a week. Hey. Nice practice. Thanks. You're not taking my spot. Do you play right-side attack? Damn straight. Then I'm definitely taking your spot. Let it go. (Chuckles) Ahh. (Knock on door) You wanted to see me? Yeah, take a seat. So, uh, you've been practicing with us... For, what, about a week now? What do you think? Uh... Well, I think you've got a good system going on... Thanks, kid, but I don't need you to kiss my butt. I'm asking if you can play with them. Not a one-man dance out there, But actually working with them as a unit. I thought you weren't gonna play me. Well, that may change. May? May. You're not the God's gift you think you are, But you're better than I expected. Yes... I can play with them. Good. You'll suit up on Friday. It's our last game before the playoffs. Impress me. (Overlapping shouts) Why isn't he playing Conor? Relax, he knows what he's doing. I don't think Dave's gonna give him a fair shot. You know us Sullivans, huh? We always a way to get it done. (Laughs) Move your feet! Let's have some pressure, defense! All right, Dupree out! Sullivan! Eh-eh. Remember what I told you? You got it? Got it, coach. Dad: Okay, here we go. It's about time. He just wanted to show Conor who's boss. You think that taught Conor anything? Heh! Doubt it. (Shouting) Let's go, baby! Nice goin'! You gotta get your body between the ball and the goal, son. What is this, girls' volleyball? (Cell phone ringing) Good scrimmage! First team, come off! I'll be right back. Dave: Nice job, first team, good work. Good work today. Nice. Good effort. Let's go, second team! Let's see some pressure, let's hear some talk! That's what I'm talk... come on, let's hear some talk! (Shouting) Come on, let's go! Keep it moving! Keep that ball high! (Shouting continues) (Whistle blows) End of the day. Hit the showers. Good work today. Good work today, everybody. You didn't have to wait. Well, I think we should talk. All right. So, who was that on the phone? They need me back in Iraq. Well, mom needs you here. So does Keegan. Under six months. That's it. That's just another surge. We could've just stayed in California. At least then I'd have some friends to hang out with... I know it wasn't part of the plan. Then this is where you need to be. This is your future. Six months. Come on. * Conor? I've got something for you. What is it? A box of roses. Just open it. That's what you said they called you, right? Captain America? Hope you score a lot of goals with that, son. But it's important how you score. Never put yourself above the game. Now, give your old man a hug. Come on. I'll have my right hand shot down when you get back. Can't wait. Keep your head down over there. You just keep your head up over here. (Alarm ringing) * He's here. You're late, west coast. Late to my own practice that you're intruding on. Intruding, huh? We could leave. You can stay. My work here is done. At least try to play hard-to-get. Shut up. You ready? Let's do it. (Grunting) You okay? Yeah. Fine. I can't shoot with this thing. Shooting strings are a mess. Ahh. Much better. Maybe if you didn't shoot so hard. I heard about your dad. Yeah? How long is he gone for? Six months. Hmm. (Car horn honks) (Sighs) Same time tomorrow? Well, I'd hate to intrude. (Chuckles) Uhh! Morning. (Sighs) It's fine. When your daughter leaves the house before dawn, It's not spying, it's parenting. (Scoffs) I'm not sure it's a good idea To hang around that Sullivan kid, though. Dad, I barely even know him. Right. Everybody gather up! Whole team, gather! Let's go! Everyone, bring it in! I've just been informed That Briarfield has been selected as the location For the first ever east-west championship game. Gentlemen, it is my intention That we're not only hosting that game, But we're playing in it. Hands in, men. Warriors on three. (Cheering) One, two, three. All: Warriors! Let's go out and show 'em who we are! Come on! (Overlapping shouts) (Whistle blows) Sullivan, get in there for Dupree. Uhh! Uhh! (Overlapping shouts) Bounce back up. Let's go. (Whistle blows) We got number 9... unsportsmanlike conduct. Two minutes. That was a stupid play. He pushed me, I pushed back. Come on Briarfield! Man down! Let's go! (Indistinct shouts) Nice game, Conor. Except for the penalty. Dad would've been proud. Thanks, mom. There's some mail for you. (Laughs) What is it? Dad signed me up for some old-school lacrosse camp. Looks good, doesn't it? Run by native American players. Your dad used to love it up there. "Ha ha, dad. Indian lacrosse camp. Hooray east coast." Your dad knows how to text? Uh, yeah. He said he made his private show him. (Coughs) * then we went up * we are much older * you wait like an angel * and I pine like a soldier * * but I remember love * love don't remember me * it's been a long * long time * since I've been on * your mind * but I cannot * decline * anything for you * I'll drink the whiskey * you'll drink gin and tonic * * you got much more strong * * I got more neurotic * but I remember love * but love don't remember me * * now that I've been replaced * * I have the guts to face * (Lyrics indistinct) Mother: Thank you for coming. Is it cold in here? (Indistinct chatter) Hey. With all due respect, son, I think your mom needs you here. I can't stay. I just can't. A warrior doesn't run from pain. Do the right thing by your family And stick around. I'm sorry, but I just really need to get out of here. (Indistinct chatter) Hey, you mind if I, um... I'm... I'm so... It's okay. I'm so sorry. I can't go back in there right now. Let's... Let's get out of here. Okay? I'll drive. Yeah. (Grunting) Arms extended. Are you better? A little. As good as I can be. Hey, Brookie. Come on, we gotta go. (Sighs) See you tomorrow? You know the time. I thought I asked you to stay away from him. What is your problem? He just buried his dad. He's not real stable right now. I just don't want to see you get hurt. * Uhh! What was that? What? What was that? (Overlapping shouts) Hey! Hey! Settle down! Settle down! Dupree, you're done. Back off, back off. Sullivan, get out. Go, go. Get out of here. Let's go, everybody back to work. Come on. Get back to your stations. Let's go. Mom: Is this about what happened? Dave: Believe me, it's not about that. I have a responsibility to... Hello, Conor. Coach. I was just talking with your mother About whether to let you play again. It's been a month since... I thought you'd be a little less hotheaded by now, But after today, I... I need this. Otherwise, I can't play at the naval academy. I know. But I need you to be a player, not a liability. I'm trying to get this team In the national championship game. We could use you. But if you fight again, That's it... You are off my team. So, what you're saying is, I have to let them beat on me and just take it? If you want to come back as a player, you're welcome. Otherwise, don't come back at all. But what you're doing out there now Is not lacrosse. Brooklyn: You think you know someone. You have a nice connection. But before they can let you in, They've got to let themselves in. They have to learn their own heart. Come on, you're gonna be late. Come on, you said yourself you needed to play. Don't waste this opportunity. I'm not going. You've been given a second chance. Just leave me alone. Honey, I know this is hard for you. Do you?! Come on. You need to suck it up, mom. That's what this is? You're sucking it up? Since you've got it all figured out, Why don't you step up and be a man? Get yourself to school on time. Maybe you can spend a little time with Keegan. Because you know what? He's not sucking it up. He's gotta learn. Hey. Hey. Where were you this morning? I was up late. Okay. I thought you wanted to be the best. What's the point? You know your dad's never liked me. Doesn't even want you around me. Oh, come on. We both know My dad cares more about winning the championship game. But it isn't enough to be good, Conor. Maybe if you were more of a team player, He would find a way to use you. Wow. So, you're taking his side now? Are you serious right now? I have been on your side since day one. Frankly, I don't know what your side is anymore. (Whistle blows) Sullivan, Douglas is banged up. Get in there. Left side attack. Yes. All right, Briarfield, let's go! Come on! Hey, Sullivan! How you liking that left side? (Whistle blows) (Overlapping shouts) Here, here, here! Come on! Come on! (Shouting continues) Ref, come on! (Cheering) Conor, no! (Whistle blows) You're done. Get out of my sight. You all right? (Indistinct chatter) * (Yells) What is wrong with you? Hey! Stop right there! (Sighs) Heck of a way to start spring break. Any idea who might've done this? Um, it all happened so fast. I didn't... * in the light of the sun * is there anyone? * oh, it has begun * oh, dear, you look so lost... * No. * your eyes are red, your tears are shed * * this world you must have crossed, you said * * you don't know me * and you don't even care * oh, yeah * you said * you don't know me * and you don't wear my chains * * oh, yeah Conor. I'm going to bed. You're not going anywhere, Conor Sullivan. * essential, yet appealed * you carry all your thoughts * * across an open field * where flowers gaze at you * they're not the only ones * who cry when they see you, you said * * you don't know me * and you don't even care * no, no, no, Sullivan! He doesn't deserve that name. The kid has no idea. You wear glasses? No. Any prescription medication I need to know of? What? No. Do you have a cell phone? No. From this point on, you do not speak unless spoken to. Am I clear? You're coming with me. Like hell I am. Fine. Spend another night in jail. Okay, okay. So, where are we going? The six nations work camp. It's where we send all the reservation kids Who can't get their life together... Kids like you. Work camp? Like picking up litter and shit? Get out. (Both speak native language) Court papers? Didn't get that far. Weapons? Drugs? Pornography? What? No. I'm gonna frisk you just the same. And this will turn into a court case if you're lying. Hands on the counter. Spread your feet. And your cheeks. Sit. I'll grab your counselor. I am his counselor. Yeah? Okay. Missionary Ridge. Think you can find your way back in the dark? Shitfaced and blind. (Both speak native language) (Thunder) Not that it matters, But would you mind explaining to me this whole thing? Do not speak unless spoken to. Well, where are we going? What are we supposed to eat? You gotta be kidding me. (Thunder) Jeez! You need to build a shelter If you plan on getting some sleep. It's impossible. (Thunder) Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! * If heaven would fall down from the sky * * and I'd walk right in * I wouldn't know where to begin, no * (Lyrics indistinct) * what did I ever do * to deserve to be kicked out? * * oh, oh * can you remind me? * or can we write the songs... * Who are you texting? Joe? Yeah. Any news from your felon? I can't stop thinking about him. But how do you know if someone's right for you? Obviously, I can't ask my dad about Conor, And my mom's been gone for so long. I just don't know. I guess you just have to trust yourself, And if he's right for you, you'll know it. Mm-hmm. (Coughs) (Coughs) (Coughs) Hey, home slice. How come you slept out in the rain last night? I got a great shelter here. Why didn't you come get me? Is it noon yet? I don't know. Aren't you an Indian? Can't you look up at the sun or something? Well, it's gotta be noon somewhere. Well, you'd better get started. Started on what? Knocking it down. Why would I want to knock down A perfectly good shed? Don't you live in this place? I've got my reasons. I don't even know how to use one of those. This is gonna be harder than I thought. Which is your chicken-choker? My what? Answer the question. Are you really asking me that? You could've killed me, man! Lefty. Interesting. One hand on the bottom, one on the top. Swing over your shoulder, extend your arms. You get a lot more power that way. This place is a freakin' mansion. How am I supposed to knock it all down? Board by board. Board by ever-loving board. Am ambidextrous. * * you feel like a candle * in a hurricane * just like a picture... Be sure to extend your arm. * alone and helpless * like you've lost your fight * * but you'll be all right * you'll be all right * 'cause when push comes to shove * * you taste what you're made of * * you might bend till you break * * 'cause it's all you can take * * on your knees, you look up * * decide you've had enough * * you get mad, you get strong * * wipe your hands, shake it off * * then you stand * whoo, ooh * 'cause when push comes to shove * * you taste what you're made of * * you might bend till you break * * 'cause it's all you can take * * on your knees, you look up * * decide you've had enough... * (Man screaming) Get working. I have blisters. (Laughs) There's gotta be a purpose. Crazy Indians got me knocking down a stupid shed 'cause it represents me breaking myself down. Yeah. So stupid. Why am I doing this? You tell me. You're the one who screwed up. When do I get to go home? When you learn your lesson. When's that gonna be? When I'm finished knocking down your palace here? Kid, there's dozens of buildings just like this Waiting for you and that sledgehammer. What, Sully's little boy Want to come out here and take a swing? Temper is good. It's how you use it that matters. When you fight, you quit. Right? In life, in lacrosse... You know you failed. You know you're not gonna win. So, you throw a punch. And you quit. Get back to work, you little jerk-off. (Squawking) Is it 12:00 yet? Crazy Indian. Where's your sundial? Save it. You work, I'll talk. You know, I'm a full-blooded Iroquois. This may sound antiquated to you, But the Iroquois banded with five other tribes To form the six nations... A participatory democracy That lasts to this day. I have no idea what any of that means. A participatory democracy Means that my people got the vote 100 years before Thomas Jefferson Decided all men were created equal. So? So, you couldn't be more authentically And originally American than that. So, the next time you call me a crazy Indian, I will personally tattoo those words to your forehead. Do I have to remind you again? Do not speak unless you're spoken to! I was talking to myself. What? I'm pretty sure this is illegal. So is destroying a trophy case. Now, work! (Man shouting in the distance) (Shouting continues) (Shouting) Heh. Permission to speak. Define "warrior". Someone who spills blood on the field of battle. What about... I know what you're gonna say. But don't waste your breath asking. Turf burns do not now and never will count As spilling blood. I'm sure your dad taught you all this. My dad was never really around to teach me much. Well, that's too bad for you. 'Cause my colonel was there for me in a big way. Let me tell you a story. I left the F.O.B. In a re-supply convoy To the other side of Fallujah. You know what we were carrying? Ammo? Energy drinks. Gatorade and red bull. The bare necessities, right? Then, all of a sudden, we come to a traffic jam. Before I know it, I'm hit. And the corpsman takes one in the head As he runs to save me. And, I mean... We can't move. All of a sudden, we're surrounded. End of story. Then your dad just comes out of nowhere, Like the cavalry. You know what he says to me? "I'll never drink another Gatorade As long as I live." And somehow he gets the medevac. He gets me out. He gets everybody out. I never knew a warrior better than him. Duke: Well, you're up early. Can't sleep. I could swear I'm hearing things. Well, all right. Let's go find them. Find what? The noises. (Men shouting and whooping) Conor: So, that's what I've been hearing? (Shouting) Some of those guys are the counselors From the six nations lacrosse camp Your dad signed you up for. They come down here To play the counselors from the work camp. Who are the other players? It's just them. It's real lacrosse. And, brother, let me tell you... real. Your dad played here. He was a counselor? Just a camper. Hand-picked... For his love of the game was pure. (Overlapping shouts) You know, Milligan played at this game, too. You didn't know that, did you? He and your dad played together at Navy after that. They were cool until a woman came between them. Milligan fell hard for her. Your dad just stole her away. My mom? My dad did that? To a friend? You know, every great man has a weakness, And Sully's... It was Claire. I'm giving up lacrosse. Why? Just because your old man wasn't a Saint? You don't get it. Every time I pick up a stick, Every time I hear the word "lacrosse", I think of my dad. You know, if I could say something... Let him run in your veins. Let him make you better. He was proud of you. Don't forget that. Let's go. (Shouts and laughter) West coast. Duke, how you doing, sir? What are you doing here? Spring break. This is where I learned to play. Briarfield made the championship. Good for you guys. Thanks. Come on, be on my team. Let's go. Here we go! Go! (Cheering) All right, guys, I found a couple more. This game's faster. Looks the same to me. Heh. Ready? Game on! Trash talk out here... You lose a few teeth. (Overlapping shouts) Ha ha ha! You see that? Were you watching the roll dodge Or were you watching Joe getting burned? I was watching Joe get schooled. Iron sharpens iron. All right? Joe's getting awfully sharp today. Two points down! (Shouting continues) Go! Go! Go! (Shouting continues) Go! Go! Ha ha ha! Ha! Yeah! (Shouting continues) What the hell, man? Joe! Joe! Joe! Come on, man! (Shouting continues) Here we go, here we go. Really?! (Grunting) Get off me! (Grunting) Nighty night. Let's go! Play on. Here we go. It's more than a game, west coast. When are you gonna learn that? Brooklyn: It's hard to say if warriors are born Or if they're made by circumstances. I know everyone faces hardship in life. It just seems like some people Are actually made stronger by it. Brooklyn: I thought you wanted to be the best. Dad: Sometimes in life, you just gotta suck it up, son. What you're doing out there now is not lacrosse. When I was your age, I could go for hours. Conor: Think I don't do that? I never see it. Brooklyn: What is wrong with you?! Mom: Why don't you step up and be a man? Hey. This place is starting to bore me. Let's head back. So, I still don't get it. Was this supposed to be a metaphor? Was I knocking down the walls of my anger? I mean, what was I doing up there? You think too much. It's a simple question. How do you feel right now? Pissed that you kicked my butt. Other than that. Honestly? Confused. It's about time. What? I spent a week... Knocking down a house... So I could feel confused? You spent a week knocking down a house So you could feel at all. Look, you're on your own now. I'm not gonna be able to be there To rein in that temper Or whisper words of sweet wisdom in your ear. You gotta hold it together. Can you do that? Yeah. Sure. Well... That's a resounding hoorah. You know, if I was a betting man... which I am... I wouldn't put a single George Washington On your self-importance. Ahh... that's just the way I am. Now, your old man... He would've probably done things differently. You asked me for the definition of a warrior. A warrior gets the job done. That's all I got. Now get out of my truck. Yes, sir. Hey, kid. For the record, I'm rooting for you. Thank you. (Starts engine) Whoa. What's up, buddy? Man, you need a shower. I try. Mom... Is it okay if I go see Brooklyn? Here. Wish me luck. (Sighs) (Playing classical music) (Stops playing) (Doorbell rings) (Resumes playing) Help you? I'm here to see Brooklyn. I'm not so different from you. You're never playing for me again. But I'll play. Anywhere there's a couple of goals and a field, I can find a game. I'm a lacrosse player. And that's one thing no one can ever take away from me. And, with all due respect, Tell Brooklyn I stopped by. Hey. * Brooklyn: The heart's a funny thing. It can break, it can beat a little faster. But the most important thing it can do is heal. And if you follow it, It'll lead you where you need to go. (Beeps) * (Beeping) Get up. (Laughs) Where'd you come from? (Indistinct chatter) Oh. (Laughs) I can do that, too. Aah! Ha ha! Goal. That was cheating. (Beeps) All right. Oh! (Indistinct chatter) Here, take it. Oh! (Beeps) (Laughs) * will you feel anything at all? * * if I kiss you where it's sore * * if I kiss you where it's sore * * will you feel better, better, better? * * will you feel anything at all? * * will you feel anything at all? * (Beeps) * will you feel anything at all? * Joe: Good, Sullivan. Nice to see you, east coast. Nice to be seen, west coast. Performing your penance? How'd you know I was here? Word gets out. If you don't mind, I invited some friends. Let's go, guys! Whoa! There he is! The boys took a little vote, And we decided we could use your help this next game. In case you didn't hear, we're, uh... We're playing your old school for the championship. Thanks, Dupree. I won't let you guys down. What's up, boys? Let's go, guys. Let's throw some balls around, huh? Brooklyn: The beauty of finding yourself And really knowing who you are Is that it allows the possibility For others to be a part of your world as well. Hey. Heh. * do you * want to get to * know me? * every little thing that * makes me me * if you want the best I've got * * it'll cost you a little honesty * * take a deep breath * and tell me what you're feeling... * (Sighs) Hey. Hey. What the hell is this? We need west coast. Out of the question. We aren't asking, coach. This isn't a democracy. He knows Sierra better than any of us. Come on, you guys. Get back to class. Brooklyn? You need to find a way, coach. This is a team issue, Brookie. No. No, it's personal, daddy. So find a way. Either Conor plays, or none of us play. There's a national title on the line. We're a team. Remember? Sullivan's a good kid, and he's been through a lot, But he's not up to this. And he'll take you all down with him. Then we all go down together. Big game today, dad. I'm sure you'd have something inspirational to say. Well, guess what? I met a girl. She's beautiful, dad. And the best part is... She's Milligan's daughter. I'm sure you got a kick out of that. You should see my right-handed shot. I miss you, dad. I'm gonna get it done. I promise you. (Cheering) (Overlapping shouts) Look sharp, west coast. Respect the game, east coast. You ready to win this? How cute is he? He looks like his father. (Whistle blows) Let's go! Sideline, everybody! Gather up, gentlemen. This is it. The national championship is on the line. It's yours to win. Hands in, gentlemen. Do or die. "Warriors" on three. One, two, three! All: Warriors! Let's go, baby! To the national high school lacrosse championship, This will be the first ever national high school lacrosse championship, Featuring the best of the east... the Briarfield warriors... Versus the best of the west... The Sierra lions. Shake hands. The captains shake as we get ready For the national championship high school match-up. Dude. Midfield, new team. Fresh start, green hornet. What's Riggins doing here? Late-season transfer. How sweet is that? You hear me, Sullivan? Did you say something? Both teams at midfield as we get underway. We'll have a chance to see If west coast lacrosse is ready For the national stage, And whether they can overcome the transfer Of their former star player... Number 9, Conor Sullivan. All right, all right! (Shouting continues) Shot, and a goal! Briarfield goes on the board first. Possession Sierra, to number 14... That's Riggins moving the ball up the field. Unchallenged on the outside. And a nice save by the Briarfield goalie, And the ball's out the other way. These east coast teams can move the ball well, And Briarfield's "d" is doing just that With a diagonal up the field. (Shouting continues) Go to 3! And a shot! Goal, Briarfield. Late in the second quarter, With a 3-1 Briarfield advantage. Shot Sierra... score! All right, good finish! Let's do it! Goal, Briarfield! Yes! Number 9... Sullivan... Doing it all by himself. Sullivan scores! This could be a different game tonight If 9 were still wearing the purple of Sierra. (Shouting continues) Sierra just needs one to take the lead, And the later in the game we go, the more the momentum seems to shift to Sierra. Oh, and a huge hit by number 77! Next time, take his head off! And Sierra's gonna have a shot here. We're under a minute, tied at 9. (Shouting continues) Sierra working it around, controlling the pace. They swing it back up top. Riggins, stick somebody! They've got time to set something up. And a goal! Sierra has scored the go-ahead goal! Sierra has just silenced this home crowd. 28 seconds. This is embarrassing. We gotta tie this up. What you got in mind? You're captain America. Nah, they know my moves. That's why we gotta change it up. Hey, offense, get in. Come on, guys. Briarfield needs a big play If they hope to pull this out. All: Break! Let's go, white! Nice play, white! Come on, guys. Come on, Briarfield! Here we go. National title on the line. 10-9, advantage Sierra. Captain America! Sullivan! Find Sullivan! The ball's down. The ball's up. Oh! Possession Briarfield! That's Joe Bryant. The long stick is going across midfield. He's looking to pass inside. Finds Sullivan. Sullivan with a great dodge. He cuts to the middle, looking for his big left. Needs a shot. No, he dishes back! Goal Briarfield! There's no time on the clock. But we are not done yet. Hey, we've got overtime. Don't get kicked out of this. You east coast guys, man. Talk about overrated. Did Riggins just call me east coast? You are, aren't you? That's not captain America. It is over here. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, by coaches' choice, There will be no overtime. We're still in there. The game will be decided by braveheart. Why are we doing braveheart? Before the game, the officials asked, "do you want to do overtime or braveheart?" You agreed without asking me? I didn't know a west coast team would be that good. Let's go! This is our game! All right, guys. Settle down, it's not over. Come on, settle down. Gentlemen, the game is gonna be decided by braveheart. Dupree, that's you. Not me, coach. Bryant's hurt. But Conor's not. You know these guys better than Dupree. It has to be you. Sullivan, you up for this? Okay, we know Sullivan's looking for a fight. Find it for him. Hit him, and hit him hard. Sooner or later, he'll lose it. All right, let's do it. Let's do it! Let's go! Let's go! The nets will be brought to center field. This is sudden death. No time on the clock, no time outs. Simple rules. The first to score wins the game. Ladies and gentlemen, please join us on the field for braveheart. Oh, I can't take this. We have to go. (Laughs) Braveheart may be a new development for organized lacrosse, But its pedigree comes straight out of the sport's history As a true test of a warrior. No rest, nowhere to hide... Just man-on-man sudden death. Who has the heart to battle it out to the finish? Down. Too bad your dad's not here to see you lose. Don't worry. There's more than enough of him here. (Whistle blows) Possession Riggins. Driving Sullivan up the field. Left hand hold. No clean opportunity. Come on, Conor. Fires. Blocked. First chance for Sierra comes up short. And now to Sullivan. Come on, Sullivan. Sullivan looks for an opportunity. And he's down. Riggins... Going back the other way. Sullivan holding ground. Riggins lowers his left shoulder, Tries to spin. No movement. Sullivan denies. You can take him. Come on, Conor! Come on, get him! Riggins fires from the outside, And shot blocked. Easy save. Back the other way. Let's go, Sullivan. Ohh! Riggins lays into him. Get used to that, Sullivan. This contest is a bit chippier As time goes on and tempers flare. Sullivan looks fired up by the contact. Come on, come on! Sullivan hunting for the game-winner. Working the right side now. Come on! Come on, Sullivan. Lining up for his big left. Fires it! A clutch save! You can't let him take that, Riggins! (Shouting) Riggins gets past Sullivan. He's driving. Take him down! Get him! A shot! Crowd: Ohh! His stick got tangled up in Sullivan's facemask. The shot was wide, but Briarfield may be in trouble here anyway. You all right, son? Dad: Conor... Hope you score a lot of goals tonight, son. But it's important how you score. Never put yourself above the game. Conor: I have to let them beat on me and just take it? Duke: Temper's good. It's how you use it that matters. Dave: If you fight again, you are off my team. Dad: Promise me that you'll show humility. Duke: When you fight, you quit. It's more than a game, west coast. When are you gonna learn that? Duke: A warrior doesn't run from pain. A warrior gets the job done. 9, you okay? If you can't continue, I'm gonna have to call a forfeit. Nah. We've got business. All right, play on! (Blows whistle) Come on, boy! Sullivan attacks, powers. Come on, Sullivan! (Grunting) Ride him, Sullivan! Push him out! Push him out! Riggins giving nothing away. Come on, come on. Take the shot! Sullivan spins, he's got an opening. It's in! It's in! Briarfield wins! Briarfield wins! The first national high school lacrosse championship Will go to the east coast Briarfield warriors. Thanks for being part of a great championship game. Congratulations on the game, Conor. Coach, thanks again for the second chance. I could say the same to you. Great job. Good job, Conor. Coach, congratulations. Thanks. You played a hell of a game. Impressive... Captain America. Nice right-handed shot. Yeah? Well, now I'm ambidextrous, too. Way to go. Your boys played well. Thank you, honey. Congratulations. Go ahead. You heading back? Unfinished business. Sergeant major. Hey. I gotta ask you... Hammering down the house... Metaphor or not? Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Well done, honey. Thanks, mom. Hey, Sullivan. You got a minute? With all due respect, sir, I need a few minutes with my family. All right. Nice job. Brooklyn: It isn't easy watching people you love get hurt, And it's impossible to replace Some things in life that are lost. But everything I look for in a person... Someone who stands up when they're knocked down, Can work with a team, And has strength and humility... Can be found through this game. Maybe that's why lacrosse... Or baaga'adowe... Is known by another even older name... The creator's game. Native Americans believe they play For the pleasure of their creator. Sometimes I think that's why we do anything at all. (Cheering) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please rise As we honor the memory of lieutenant colonel Sully Sullivan With a missing man formation. You do your dad a great honor. Respect the game. Hey, Sullivan, give me your stick. You know what? Today you're gonna carry this. Lead us out. Let's go. Let's go!
