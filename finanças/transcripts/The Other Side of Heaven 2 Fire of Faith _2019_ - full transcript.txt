My name is John H. Groberg. I served my first mission to Tonga in the 1950s as a 19-year-old young man from a small town in Idaho. The things I experienced there, the people I met changed me forever. The faith of the Tongan people and their unconditional love live on in my heart to this day. When I returned home after three years, I married the love of my life, Jean Sabin. And we settled in Idaho Falls where we started our family which soon included four vivacious girls. It was the '60s and the world was changing in profound ways. Reeling from President Kennedy's assassination, the tragedy of the Vietnam War, and the eruption of an exuberant rock and roll counterculture. But the most powerful change of all came when African Americans, led by a Baptist minister named Martin Luther King, Jr., demanded their civil rights. I remember watching Dr. King speak to 200,000 supporters on the National Mall in Washington DC. As I watched him on my little black and white TV set, inside my little house in Idaho Falls... I have a dream today. I felt a familiar spirit. It was the spirit of the Tongan ministers I had heard preach during my mission to Tonga. Men whose faith and works were mighty. Since that time, I have known and served with some of the most wonderful religious leaders the world has ever known. But all these years later, I can say in all sincerity, that none of them were better men than the humble, faithful ministers I met during my time in Tonga. Those in whose hearts burns most brightly the Fire of Faith. Daddy. Hey, here we go, ready? Hup, hey, around. My turn. Don't fight over your daddy. It's okay, I have two arms, come here. - Ready? Off we go. - Whee. - Yes. - Yay. Ah, now I'm dizzy. Daddy. Ah, Jean, that's our song. Sister Olsen, would you mind? Absolutely, Bishop. All right, girls, you stay with sister Olsen, it's Mommy's turn. Let's go, kick off those shoes. There you go. Don't overexert yourself. You'd think I was pregnant with our fifth baby. You are. That's it. Nice. Okay, how about this? And up and over. Yes. Be careful, Mommy. Go, Jean! Beautiful. Jean, what's wrong, honey? Are you okay? Jean, are you all right? Jean, how can I help? What's wrong, honey? How can I help? I'm just kidding. Hey! Still got it. You still got it. Come on, girls. Daddy, yay! Here, hold my hand. And apart, and together, and apart, and... Yep, watch your step. Good night, Bishop. Good night, Sister Cadmol. Great party. Thank you for coming, Sister Smith. Whoo. Sorry to keep you waiting. Aww. It's so peaceful out here. Yeah, it is, isn't it? All the noise and the joy in the church, and then... just peace. Kind of makes me... Feel like I... I... I wanna burst. Well, forgive me, my dear, but I think you're about to. Ha ha. John, you do know you're driving without your lights on. I do know. It seems like it'd be an insult to all this beautiful moonlight. Do you have any idea how many miles that light has traveled to shine down on you? I know. I know. On us. Even better. Good afternoon, Natani, I see your wife is better. Yes, there, Minister. Our prayers have been answered. Thanks be to God. And to you. My faith was in God, I hope yours was also. We only knew of God because of what you taught us. And I because of what others had taught me. We thank you for listening to them, so that you could teach us. There have been others who have taught us as well. We've decided to join with the Mormons. We have brought you this month's offering, some ufi, some talo and baby pig. God willing, we'll have enough to give offerings to both churches this coming year. That will not be necessary. We are in your debt. You are in God's debt, and this is how you repay him, with this... with this blasphemy, huh? We had hoped that you would give us your blessing. I cannot do that. Then we can only give you ours. Thanks be to God for you, Reverend Paletu'a. You brought us to Christ. Natani! Do not ever come back. - Fatai. - Yes. Take this food, burn it in the fire. Yes, Father. Throw the pig in the sea. But Father... Throw the pig in the sea. So you're telling me you're at an impasse? Bishop, I haven't budged one bit. Only person at an impasse here is her. Get your finger out of my face or I'll bite it off. Sister Lawson, please don't bite your husband. Sister Lawson. If he's gonna treat me like a dog, I may as well act like one. Your dog is the problem. My dog saved your life. I would have gotten out of there without its help. You would have died stuck on the pot and you know it. Sister, brother... Lawson's, please. You ought to thank your lucky stars Bonnie came in with the newspaper. Okay, all right, all right. Uh, Bishop Groberg, are you okay? Yes, but... please tell me how I'm supposed to feel when two of my ward's stalwarts are threatening divorce over a dog. Uh, I-I'm sorry, Bishop, but that dog pees everywhere. Look who's talking. A-And... she... She loves that dog more than she loves me. That's because he treats me better than you do. Is that true, Verl? What, that she loves the dog more than she loves me? That the dog treats her better than you do. Well, I don't know, Bishop. I mean, I don't roll over and play dead every time she asks, if that's what you mean. Yeah, and you don't curl up and snuggle with me either, unless you want something. Well, it sounds to me like you're both getting better treatment from the dog than you are from each other. No, but that's the whole point, Bishop, that's why we gotta get rid of him. - Or you. - Or you. I said it first. I rest my case. I'm hungry, Mommy. It will be ready soon. Bang, bang, you're dead, Lucy girl. Nancy don't kill your sister in the kitchen. You can't kill me, I just killed you. Girls, don't talk like that. We're not talking, we're yelling! Kaboom! That's my canon! Kaboom! Kaboom! Who put a Q-tip in the yogurt? I wanna eat, Mom. - Bang, bang! - Boom! Oh, what in the world, John? I had another meeting with the Lawsons. Uh, no, you... ah. Can you put that thing in the garage please? Good idea. Okay. He likes you, Daddy. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got a letter from Salt Lake today, I think it's a mistake, though, because it's addressed to Elder Groberg. Hmm. Ah, girls, help... help me clean this up, will you? Come on. Put them all on the side, this one... Is very heavy. John, what's wrong? How soon can you have that baby? Dear, Brother Groberg, you are hereby called to serve as President of the Tonga Fiji mission. You will serve for a period of three years at the mission headquarters in Nuku'alofa, Tonga. You will preside over 200 missionaries on 40 islands in three countries, speaking five languages. We trust the Lord will watch over you and your family as you lose yourself in His service. She loves being held by you. I love her, but when are we gonna get a boy, Mommy? Well, whenever Heavenly Father sends us one, darling. Where is your father? Selling kava at the other end of the market. I do not think he would approve of your talking to me. My father would not approve of many things. How is our little pig? He's not here for sale if you're looking to buy him. I am going to make him big and fat, and I am going to offer him to your father again. I don't think my father will change his mind. Then I will own the oldest, fattest pig in all of Tonga. Why did you do it, Natani? Why did you leave my father's church? I had questions your father could not answer. But you shamed our family, our village. I honored your father. I honored your father by building upon the truth that he gave to me. If he allowed me, I would tell him all about it. He would rather die. He would rather I die. Perhaps. I heard my father speaking with the leaders of the village. You should move, quickly, before there is trouble. But Tofua is my home. Tofua was your home. Until you joined with the Mormons. I heard my father say it with my own ears. There will never be Mormons in Tofua. Ever. Your family is young, your farm is small. You can do better elsewhere. You'll be safer elsewhere. You will help me? I will come tomorrow night. My father sleeps soundly after eating momo. Toutai. Thank you for warning me. Thank you for taking care of my pig. Wow, Daddy, everybody's brown here. Yes, they are. And everything's green. Everything but the sea. Is this where I'll shop? Uh, well, there's a store in town, but the freshest stuff is all here. Sure is fresh. - There it is. - It's our new home. Isn't it great? That was a wonderful dinner, Sister Dalton. You should thank Siueti. - Malo aupito, Siueti. - Yes, thank you. Thank you so much, Sister Siueti. You're welcome, Elder Monson. Can we be excused now, Mommy? Um... Just stay in the courtyard. Let's go. Not you, honey, it's bedtime. Up. Come on. No, no. Go with Kesaia, please. President... Groberg, Sister Dalton and I were talking with Elder Monson before you arrived. I know you've been a missionary in Tonga before, but I'm not sure you've thought about how this place suits your children. We just worry about how young your family is. Ew, Nancy, that's gross. Well, I'm sure the Lord will take care of us. The Lord cares for those who care for themselves. Missionaries have died serving here. The medical care is primitive. You should ask to be reassigned. That's a juicy one! Uh, President Dalton, I... we appreciate your concern. Elder Monson, you were involved in our call, what do you think? I think President Dalton is right. And I think you are right. I'm sorry? The Lord could make good use of you elsewhere, but I think if you decide to stay and trust in the Lord, there will be challenges, but He will take care of you. We thank all of you for your concerns. Yes. But we believe the Lord sent us here for a reason, and we believe He will see us through. Yeah, well, I understand. But I'm not sure you do. Yes, President... I think he does. But what about... Why don't we go back to the hotel so that John and Jean can get settled. Certainly. You made the right choice. Squish, squish, squish, got 'em! Me too. We're killing bugs, Mommy. Yeah, I can see that. We'll be at the hotel if you need anything. Thank you. Have a safe flight. Let's go, girls. Get 'em. Got him! Big one. Two one. Okay, so let me get this straight, we have ten districts. Eleven. Eleven districts, uh, 100 branches. Ninety-eight. Thank you, Nancy. Uh, 200 missionaries, 10,000 members on 40 different islands. In three different countries. And five languages. Okay, uh, who handles the finances? Um, you do. Uh, government relations? Also you. Chapel construction? So, tell me, when am I supposed to do missionary work? The cart horse seemed tired today, huh, Fatai? Yes, Father, it did. And then this morning, Natani and his family are gone. Like bats in the night, disappeared. Coming back from the garden, I find this on the beach, full of seaweed. Did I not ask you to throw Natani's pig in the sea? Yes, Father, you did. And did you do it? You were very angry. Did you do what I asked? No. I thought you would regret your decision. So you defy me? You taught me to never waste what God gives us. This is not from God. This is from the devil. No, it's from Natani, who loves and admires you. And he has left my church, and our village with your help. You taught me to always serve my brother. I taught you to obey your father. Before those were always the same. And why not now, huh? Because you are not yourself. Because you are afraid. Afraid? - Hmm? What am I... - Please, please, please. Please. Afraid of what? Of teachings. Teachings you do not understand. What are you talking about, huh? The things that... the things that Natani learned from the Mormons, they make sense to me... Gah! Both of you, get out. Get the shovels. Get out! Sione, Sione. Think about my church. Please, please. No, don't. He must learn. Enough! And even though they were sick, the missionaries stood up in the back of their wagon and they raised their arms in the air, and they yelled "Hurrah for Israel!" - Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah for Israel! Yeah, that's right. And they all lived happily ever after. Good night, girls. Daddy? Yes, Nancy. How come do all your stories end happily ever after? That's because I'm telling them to you. No, really, even your sad stories seem to end happy. Well, if you're good, and you wait long enough, all your stories will end happily. I lost all my friends in Idaho when we moved here, what's happy about that? In three years, you're gonna go back to Idaho and you will be happy to see them. My cousin Levi died, what's happy about that? When you die, you will be with Levi in heaven. Honest? Honest. Sometimes I get scared and lonely here. Sometimes I do too. What do you do when you feel that way? I tell stories with happy endings to my daughters. Daddy? Yes, Nancy. If I die before you, wherever I go, I will wait for you there. Thank you, honey. I will... I will wait for you too. Enough. Get up. You, get in. Get in the hole. Get in. You will spend the night here and have a good think. We shall see how you feel about these Mormons in the morning, huh. Fatai! I will come back for you in the morning. Yes, my father. Spend this time with yourself, huh. Have a good think. Fatai, come. What was that? Oh, it's just coconuts being blown out of the tree, honey. John! My eyes, Daddy, my eyes! Oh be careful, Jean. Okay, sweetie, yeah, keep your eyes closed. Shh. That's it. Hey, keep your eyes closed, sweetie. - I've got glass in my eyes. - That's okay. Come on. Come on, everything's okay. Everything's fine. Okay. Ow! Okay, come on, come on. - My eyes. - It's okay. Oh, God. Dear, God. Please have mercy! Give me strength! Ahh! God! Oh, dear God! Your brother, he'll die. Fatai, come! Get the gate. Father. Let me help you. Fatai, go get your brother. Ahh! Fatai! Fatai. Fatai! Fatai! Natani! Natani, come quick. Toutai, my brother, what happened to you? Peace, I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth... Give I unto you. Do not let your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid. Toutai? You are awake. I'm so happy to see you. Why did you come? What are you doing here? I need... I want you to baptize me. Okay, Toutai, I will baptize you tomorrow but you need to go back to bed. - No. - You need to rest. I need... I want to be baptized now. You have the authority. Toutai, it is the middle of the night. I will baptize you in the morning. If I die before morning, I want to die baptized. You are sure? I am sure. Okay, I will baptize you. Tonga Toutai Paletu'a. Yes, that is me, Lord. Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ. I love Jesus Christ. I baptize you in the name of the Father. I love the Father. And of the Son. I love the Son. And of the Holy Ghost. I feel the Holy Ghost. - Amen. - Amen. I have to put you under the water now. I know. It will probably hurt a lot. I know that too. Toutai? Toutai, my friend. Where have you gone? When you wake up, we are going to have a long talk. My doll's a pretty one. My doll's prettier. Oh, girls, don't fight. We're not. We are too. Jean? Jean, we got it! Got what? Approval to build a chapel in Niuatoputapu. In new what? I just got word from Elder Monson, he's going to come visit us. Oh, that's wonderful, John. How do you spell that island? It doesn't matter, I'm taking you there. What? When? Tomorrow morning. I can't wait for you to see it, Jean. This is the place where it all happened. I know, I remember. I remember. Careful on the dock, girls. It's so strange not having Marilyn and Jane with us. Oh, I know, but Siueti will take good care of them. So how long does it take to get there? Uh, five days. Give or take. We have to tow that barge. It depends on the weather. Oh, watch your step. Careful, girls. Josiah, be careful with them. This dock is not in great shape. There's a hole right there. Daddy, what's that? You'll see. Isn't he cute? You like it? Oh. Be careful, she might bite you. She doesn't have teeth yet. Ow! She does. It's a miracle, you know. What is a miracle, Kolipoki? That there's going to be a chapel on Niuatoputapu. You're right, it is a miracle. Yes, it is. It is also a miracle that we are here on this boat together, eh. Why is that? Because we are old friends. Well, why don't I recognize you, then? Because I'm all grown up. When I was little, I fell from a mango tree and hit my head on the roots. I was dead through the night but your prayers brought me back. Nuku. - You're Nuku? - Yeah. What? Come here. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't ask. It is such a blessing to see you. What are you doing here? I am working to save money for my mission. Ah, of course you are. Hey, come with me. I want you to meet my family. Girls, there's someone I want you to meet. This is Nuku. Nu who? You remember the boy on my mission that God brought back from the dead? Is it true? Are you really him? Yes, I am Nuku. I've always wanted to meet a miracle. Me too. Jean! Jean, come here, there's someone I want you to meet. This is Nuku, the boy who fell from the mango tree. How wonderful to meet you. Uh, I should go back to my post now. Ah. I have to keep watch on the barge. Can we go with him, Daddy? Please? All right, just for a little while, but do what he says, and stay away from the edge of the boat. - I will. - Okay. We will. Not you, you're too small. What are they doing, Daddy? They have to take turns on the barge. Here we go. Nuku, you can't go. Why not? Because you are our miracle. Well, then, why don't you come with me? Can I, Daddy? Can we? Uh... Just Nancy, and just for a little bit. - Yippee! - Wah. Come on. Wait a minute, we forgot Abigail. Who? Our goat. The goat. Okay, hold on. Oh. Ready? Come on, let's go. Be careful, Nancy. - I will, Mom. - I wanted to go. Well, when you're older, okay? Promise. Oh. Kolipoki, Kolipoki, come quickly. Come. Look. Reel 'em in. Reel 'em in! It's too heavy in the waves. Well, cut the engine! We'll lose control. Come on! Turn. No, don't grab it. No, no, no, no, no, no! The boat, to the boat. - Come on. - Nancy! Daddy! Ah, it's stuck! Help! Take my hand! Nuku. John, do something! Jean, get back inside. - You have to save her! - Get back inside! I got you. Jean! Go back inside with the children. Kolipoki, Kolipoki, you have to cut the rope. The barge will sink. Do it now, or we will all die. All right. Do it! Daddy! Why? Please. Please! Not my child. Don't take my girl. Please... We're okay, Daddy. Jean, they're all right. We're alive. Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah! - Hurrah! It's gone. In the storm. What do we do? John, what are we doing here? This is where we get off. How? You'll see. No, John. John, what is this? This is our only choice. No, it's not. We can turn around and go back. Go ahead, Nancy. Go ahead. This is going to be the hard part. No, no, no, no, no. - That's it, that's it. - No, no, no. - Okay. Jean, it's okay. - No, John. It's okay, it's okay. No. Ah! Feki? Feki Po'uha. Okay, just get me up there. Okay, okay. Welcome back, Kolipoki. Malo e lei lei. It's good to be back. It's good to have you. And my son with you. He didn't remember me. Well, he's all grown up. Yes, Kolipoki. Please. Good to see you, Kolipoki. Yes, very good to see you. Oh. I can't believe you still have these. Thank you for our family, Kolipoki. Well, you're very welcome. And you, really are as beautiful as he said you were. So are you. Ah. They are beautiful, Kolipoki! Asi. Your feet are fine. Yes, they're fine, they're fine. It's been a long time, Kolipoki. It's been a long time. This is my family. My wife, Ole. Ole, this is my wife, Jean. Feki, what are you doing here? I will build your chapels, Kolipoki, and you will fill them. Abigail. - Abigail. - She's alive. - Wait up, Abigail. - Abigail! Come on. True love. Yes. Jean, are you okay? Honey, are you all right? You've never been seasick before. I don't think that seasickness is the problem. I want you to know that even when it's hard... Especially when it's hard, I know we are about God's work. I will be praying for your success and happiness. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Amen. Thank you, Sister Groberg. All right, Elders and Sisters, I will now announce missionary assignments for our new missionaries. Elder Mapa? Here, Kolipoki. You'll be training Elder Wolfgramm in Nomuka. Thank you, President. You're welcome. Sisters Mataele and Niu? You will be serving together in the Liahona District. Elder Paletu'a? You will be serving with Elder Latu in Niuatoputapu. Welcome, Elder Paletu'a. Elders, that is my island. We know, Kolipoki. Thank you for sending us there. Give them all my love. We will. Foggy day, no? Yes, Reverend Sione. Very foggy. Good for planting. And fishing. This is true. You look tired, Reverend Sione. In one year, I have lost both my sons. One of them still lives. Both of them are dead to me. I have felt your pain and I have prayed for you. Thank you for your prayers. Tell me, Natani... Where is my dead Mormon son? He is a preacher. Toutai, a preacher? Like you. Where? Where does he preach? I do not know. You would have to ask the Kolipoki. The... the Kolipoki? The palangi president. His office is down that road. He can tell you where he sent your son. I have to ask the palangi president where he buried my boy? Sione Paletu'a. The Kolipoki is a good man. Like you. We shall see. Yes, come in. There's someone here to see you. Well, who is it? He says he's the father of Elder Paletu'a. Well, please send him in. Brother Paletu'a, John Groberg, pleased to meet you. I am not your brother. Well, um, please have a seat, let's talk about it. Bro... Mr. Paletu'a. Reverend Paletu'a. Reverend. I have many friends in Tonga who are ministers, they're some of the best people that I know. I am the minister from the village of Tofua. You stole my son and turned him into a Mormon. You're not a member of our church. I-I did not know that. You didn't approve of your son's baptism? I did not know that either. Where is he? Your son? He is no longer my son. Your... Elder Paletu'a is in Niuatoputapu. Samoa? Yes, almost. Why did you send him all the way there? It's a beautiful island. Your son is working hard. He is a very good missionary. A Mormon missionary? Yes. Then he is dead to me. I'm very sorry to hear that you feel that way. Is there anything that I can do? No, no, there is nothing you can do or say. Except, please tell my son... Yes? You tell him to never come back. Hi. Hi. What are you reading? A poem by Matthew Arnold. Really? It's about a husband and a wife who live in a cottage by the sea, just like us, and it's night and they hear the sound of the tide going out... Like that. And it makes them think of the loss of faith in the world. Yeah. Will you read it to me? "The sea of faith was once too at the full "and the round Earth's shore lay like the folds "of a bright girdle furled. "But now I only hear its long melancholy withdrawing roar." "Our love, let us be true to one another, "for the world which seems to lie before us "like a land of dreams "hath really neither joy "nor love, nor light, nor certitude, "nor peace, nor help for pain. "And we are here, as on a darkling plain "swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, "where ignorant armies clash by night." Ignorant armies? Hmm. Sea of faith. Be true to one another. Yes. Sort of hard to do, though, you're never here. You're always in Fiji, or some other far-flung island. Well, you are right. But I am here now. So... Take a good look. Jean, do you know why I know the Gospel's true at this very moment? Tell me, John, why is the Gospel true? Because, other than preaching that Gospel... I can't think of anything that could keep me from spending every minute of every day right here with you. How about a son? Mm. What? Queen Mata'aho had me over to the palace. She said she'd been praying, and she believed that one of the reasons God brought us all the way to Tonga, was so we could have a Tongan son. You think we're having a boy? I think the queen is gonna be really mad if we don't. Well, that would be fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Many of you have asked me what to do when the Mormon missionaries come to your houses and ask to teach you. Some of you wonder if my mind has changed now that my son is one of them. I say to you now, as I said to you before... Ignore them. Do not speak to them, smile at them, or let them teach you. Do not offer to sing in their choir. Do not send your children to their schools. Let them be dead to you as my son is dead to me. There will never be Mormons in Tofua as long as I live. Let us pray. I think it's coming. Here you go. That's it. Mommy. It's all right, Liz, just go home and go to sleep. I'll put them to bed. Okay, thank you. Nurse! Nurse! Sini, what are you doing? I'm having a baby. Do you think you could go get... - I'll go get Dr. Tapa. - Thank you. You just hold on until she gets back. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Almost there. What in the world could be taking them so long? It's a long run to Otuhaka. She's running all the way to Otuhaka? By now I hope she's running back. It's okay, honey, it's gonna be fine. - Easy for you to say. - Sorry. Okay, Sini, you can't stop them, but you don't have to help them. Try very hard to relax. I am trying. I'm gonna go get the car. I wouldn't do that, Kolipoki. They're probably almost here. Ah. Sorry, Kolipoki. It's all right, I'm okay. Baby is coming. Where's John? Where's... Sini must be calm. I can't... I can't wait. I can't stop it. Slow down, Sini. Relax. The baby is coming. The baby is coming. The baby is coming! - Oh, no! Oh. - Here it comes! It's a boy, Sini! A boy. It's a boy. He's here, he's here! - I wanna see him first. - Me first! Who wants to meet their brother? I want to see him. All right, oh, let Mom get out of the car. One at a time, girls. Tonga has a new son. It's true, Elders and Sisters, absolutely true. I took that dear Sister Morley by the hand and I promised her, "Alice," said I, "you will be with him again." Kolipoki. Daddy, you have to come home. What is it, Nancy? Johnny's sick. Jean! Jean, what's happening? He won't keep breathing. There he goes, there he goes. We should take him to the hospital. Yeah, okay. We'll give him a blessing on the way. Go, go, go, go, go. John Enoch Groberg, by virtue of the holy priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ... He's not breathing. Help, Daddy, help him. Whoa, cow! Let me drive. Get out of the way. Go. Yes. By the power of God's priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to live and breath until we can provide the proper care to sustain your life, amen. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. No, no, Nancy, you stay in the car. I want to see the miracle. Stay here and pray for it, dear. Pray very hard. Dear God, Johnny's sick, please make him better. Please, God, no, no, no. Come on, come on, breathe. - Come on, Johnny. - Come on, baby. Breath. Thank you, Lord. Thanks be to God. Your son is very weak. His heart is barely beating. He will die soon if we cannot find the cause of this weakness. Well, then we should do some tests. We don't have this kind of test here, only in the United States. Well, we should fly him there. He is dehydrated and too weak to fly. He would never make it. Well, then what? We will try to get fluids into him and we will pray that he gains the strength to make the trip. I'm so sorry I can't stay longer. God's work waits for no one. Your family is God's work. I know, I know. I know, it's just, there's a thousand saints in Fiji expecting me next Sunday. You are not to go to Fiji unless John Enoch is stable. That's one more reason to pray for him, isn't it? I'll pray for you every minute of my trip in New Zealand. God loves you, John. Thank you, Elder Monson. And so do I. Thank you very much. We interrupt this broadcast to announce a special need for faith and prayers on behalf of the baby boy of the Mormon mission president, Kolipoki. The baby is very sick and needs to fly to the United States for an operation. Please pray that the baby will get well enough to fly away soon. A fast will be held through all of Tonga for baby boy Groberg tomorrow. Anyone discovered eating before sundown will be given an opportunity to repent and fast again the next day. You heard it for yourself? In the marketplace yesterday. Just because the queen is praying for the palangi boy doesn't mean we have to. There are many in Tofua who have sympathy for the little boy. Everyone in Tofua belongs to my church. They should know better. Everyone in Tofua has been taught to be Christlike, by you. You are a good man, Seoni, but you are stubborn as a pig. You should be praying for the American boy with all your heart. You should have forgiven our son. And you should never ask a Tongan mother to choose between her husband and her son because you may not like the choice she makes. Ah. That's right, just like that. Where's your phone? It's cooler down here. Elder Monson called. He said he has a strong feeling that you and John Enoch are gonna be on the next plane to the US. He said he thinks the Lord will open the way to make that happen. The doctor tried to get an IV in for over an hour this morning, but he's just too little. And dehydrated. His veins are too small. Has he eaten at all? No. He's too weak. They were hoping to feed him intravenously. How can this happen? It can't happen. It is happening. Why don't you go be with the girls. I'll stay here with Johnny. We have brought you some dinner, Kolipoki. Thank you, but I'm fasting. No, no, we are fasting so you don't have too. Please eat this banana bread, it'll give you strength to pray. Thank you. Kolipoki, we have come to tell you, everything is going to be all right. You have? Thank you. How do you know? We have fasted and prayed since this afternoon. We will continue fasting and praying tomorrow but God has already answered our prayer, and we wanted you to know that everything is going to be fine. It will be fine, Kolipoki. We know it. Thank you for your faith. And thank you for sharing it with me. You're welcome, Kolipoki. Now you go to sleep and get some rest. I will try. After you eat my banana bread, Kolipoki. - Yes, after. - Good. One more thing, Kolipoki. Yes. We would like to sing a little more. That would be wonderful. He's my son. He's my only son. Get him! Hello, Tonga Toutai Paletu'a. What are you doing? You have dishonored your father. My brother. I'm here to teach you a lesson. Leave him alone, take me. I will take whoever I want. I do not want to fight. I am a servant of the Lord now. Your Lord will have to fight for you! My Lord has more important things to do. You better pray to someone else. I will pray for you. I will pray that the Lord forgives you. Toutai. I will pray with all my heart, my dear uncle. Go, come. Nuku! Nuku, we need a doctor. Can you take him to the hospital in Nuku'alofa? Yes, yes, of course. I'll send a telegram to Kolipoki. Kolipoki. Nice and easy. What have they done to you? We have to get him to a doctor. Watch his head. Yes, the doctor, of course. I will pay all. Would you like to come with us? Yes. Oh, Toutai. My son, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. His brain is swollen. We won't know anything until the swelling goes down. And how long will that take? Could be days, could be months. The swelling may never go down. Is there anything we can do? Have you given him one of your blessings? I think it's time you did. Yes! Yes! Please, Kolipoki, please, please, please, please, Kolipoki, do what you need to to save my son. Tonga Toutai Paletu'a, by the authority of God's holy priesthood I anoint you with this oil which has been set apart for the healing of the sick. I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen. Tonga Toutai Paletu'a, in the name of Jesus Christ, and by the power of God's holy priesthood we lay our hands upon your head to seal the anointing you have been given. And we bless you, Tonga, with the full and complete recovery from all of your injuries. This is our blessing and our promise to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen. O yah wey! Amen. Tonga, come back to us! O yah wey! I'm sorry, I have something else I need to attend to, but I will back to check on your boy very soon. God bless you all. Thank you, Kolipoki. Saibe. O yah wey! How is he? Alive. How's Elder Paletu'a? He's pretty beat up. But he'll be all right? I don't know, Jean. I don't know much of anything anymore. Yeah, me neither. The doctor tried to put another needle in this morning. It was terrib... it was just terrible. He doesn't even cry anymore. I don't know John, I just... I'm afraid we're not gonna ever get him on that plane. Would you like to say a prayer? No. I think I'm all prayed out. It's all right. Let me take a turn. You should go home and rest. John. Yeah, honey? If by the time I come back, he's gone... It's not your fault, okay? Okay? It's not your fault. I love you. Dear God, dear Heavenly Father. I do not know why you have brought this white man to my island. I do not believe what he teaches. But my son is dying and his son is dying, and he has tried to heal my son. So now I will try to heal his. Hear me, Father in heaven, hear me now and heal this white man's boy. Because he has done nothing to hurt his son like I have hurt mine. If you heal my boy and take his away, I would be so mad at you. I do not think I could ever come to heaven. I will have to go to hell. And that would be bad for the people in my church because they depend on me to be better than I am. So please, heal this man's boy, and heal mine after. And if you have a little time... Please tell me what to do with this white man sitting here. I do not know if I should love him or hate him. Amen. Amen. I'm sorry I borrowed your baby. I wanted to see if I could help him. I think he would get better faster if the people from my church are praying for him too. I think you're probably right. I felt something when I laid my hands on your baby. I felt that he will grow to be a great man. I felt that about your son also. Is there a doctor on board? I'm a doctor. I say, chappies, unhand me this instant, or I'll report you to Her Majesty, the Queen of England. It wasn't enough that you pull me off my aircraft, now you drag me around like a common criminal. I do say, I must say there's no kind of excuse for this kind of comport... Oh, I see. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so glad you brought me here. Right there into the cut. Pull up the vein. I was taught this technique in Australia, why weren't you there? I had to stay with the boy. Right, jolly right. Now slice it open. Needle. Bang on. He did it. Let's attach the bag. Now, if you don't mind, I have an aircraft full of angry passengers awaiting my return. Thank you for your help. - Yes, thank you. - Thank you. Bloody well didn't have a choice, did I? No. But you're welcome. John! John, wake up. Hello, little man. Welcome back, welcome back. I'm so glad you can cry again. Look, look. - Look, look. - Oh. Look, look. Seoni. Seoni. Your prayers have worked. The little boy is better. Seoni, Seoni. My boy. My boy. Home. Home. Yes, my son, you have come home. Okay, girls, it's time to say good-bye to Mommy. Don't go, Mommy. It's gonna be all right. Okay? You need to be strong. - I hate it when Daddy cooks. - Oh! Me too. I won't be gone long. I never thought you flying away would be the answer to my prayers. Yeah, it does seem kinda backwards, doesn't it? - Yes, it does. - All aboard. Okay, well, I guess I better go. I love you. I love you too. Bang, bang, I got you, Liz. You can't get me, I just got you. Bang, bang, bang, bang, boom. Elders and Sisters, thank you for your patience. Before we adjourn, we have some new missionaries, and I'd like to announce their mission assignments. Sister Mokena? You've been assigned to serve with Sister Isikiela in the village of Tokomolu. Thank you, President. Elder Hinton, Elder Manu, you've been assigned the island of Ha'ano and Ha'apai. Elder Fonua. - Nuku! - Miracle man. I'll miss you too. Go back, go back, go back. Welcome to your mission, Nuku. Thank you, Kolipoki. You have been assigned to work with Elder Paletu'a... In the village of Tofua. The home of Elder Paletu'as father. Are you s... are you sure, Kolipoki? Yes, I am sure. Then thank you. Thank you for sending me there. Elders Nefai and Sitadini. And they all lived happily ever after. Good night, girls. Good night, Daddy. Good night. Daddy? Yes, Nancy? Are you sure that if you wait long enough all stories have happy endings? I'm sure. Then why hasn't Mommy come home yet? I guess we haven't waited long enough yet, hmm. Hey, you know what? Your brother is getting better and better, and your grandma and grandpa are getting ready to take care of him, and then Mommy will come back to us, promise. Daddy? Yes, Nancy. I think you're handling this all very well. Me too. Thank you, girls. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Daddy. Get under those covers. Dear Jean, how I wish you could be here with me and the girls, how I wish you could see our great missionaries. But whether you are there, or here... I sent Elder Paletu'a to his father's village today. It was one of those times the spirit whispered "yes." Having my own son so far away, thinking of his father losing his... Can you imagine it, Jean? Can you really imagine it? God sending His only son to Earth. To die. But he did it. He did. He really did. I wish you could see... - What I see. - I see.
