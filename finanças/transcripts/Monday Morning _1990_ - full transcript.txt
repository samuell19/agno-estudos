I'll never forget that morning. I don't think any of us will. Police, the newspapers, all wanted an answer. Why did it happen? Why does anything happen? Bobby was my best friend and a good guy. I'm sure he had his problems at home, what teenager doesn't? But when you move around a lot, you try not to make waves. Not Bobby. There were a lot of us new in oceana that spring and tensions were boiling at the high school. The town kids hated us, and we tried to stay out of their way, except for Bobby. What he did made all hell break loose. Come on, we gotta make it before they wake up. Mellow out, you said they're never up before 6:30, right? Yeah, we'll be done by then. It's locked? Yeah. What are you gonna do now? Find another way in. You're not gonna break in? Don't think of it as breaking in. Christ. I think it's open. Shh! Shh. I got it. Good, now get in and get out. Don't worry. Bobby, Bobby. All right, listen, go around, the keys are in the car. Bring it to the front, I'll be two minutes. All right, two minutes. Bobby, what are you doing here? Nothing. You weren't expected. Yeah, I know. Well, I came anyway. Your father's not gonna like it. I'll try to keep him busy. Don't do me any favors. Look, please. Don't start. Get what you need, maybe he won't see you. Sounds like a hell of a solution, mom. Bobby, please. For me? Think fast. Whoa. So what's that, a new ball? Nah, just a friend's. Yeah? You're back? Yeah, but not for long. , he was yelling all night. Was he yelling at you? Nah, just yelling. So where have you been staying? Where I've been staying. Well, I stayed in the car, that was really nice. I stayed over at bill's. I guess that's about it. - Hey. - Hey. So why don't you stay here? Oh boy, I'd like to but I can't. Well, a guest appearance. I thought you weren't welcome here. Thanks, I'm just leaving. Come on, Bobby. Move it, please. I'm going. Look, everything will work out. Yeah? I don't see how, we never stay in one place long enough. I thought daddy threw him out. Look, we just won't let him know. So why are you here? Answer me! I just came by to get some stuff for school. Oh yeah, right. Mr. Studious, aren't you? Frank, calm down. Kelly, get your sister ready for the center. You know, I care about school, dad. It's you who doesn't give a shit. Hey, you watch your mouth! I don't want that language around this house. Yeah, I'll watch it or I'll get hit, right? Well you ask for it sometime. Hey, hey, I'm talking to you! What about that job down the loading dock? What happened to that? It's going great, dad. I just made my first million. Oh, your first million, you made your first million. Where'd you make your first million, with that faggot music business? Why do you got an attitude all the time, huh? Why the hell does it bother you so much? Why don't you to just go. We don't need you around here. Is that it, dad? Is that it? You don't need me? Maybe you don't want me. You know, I'll tell you, I don't know what you want me to be, but this is it. I mean, this is the best I can do. Well, what do you hate me for? For what I am, or for what I'm not? Or maybe just for what you are, huh? God! Frank, calm down, calm down. You gotta get ready for work. Come on. Look, I'm sorry. No, that's it! That's the last time. Bobby! No, I don't know where I'm going, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. So just go back in and take care of your sisters. Are you all right? Yeah. Let's see. You'll be okay. God, we don't need this. We? That's a funny kind of we. He didn't mean it. He's just all wrapped up in his work. Yeah, I know. But it's just getting a little old. Look, do one thing for me, okay? Please just make sure he doesn't put his hands on them. And if he does, for god's sake let me know about it. J' Monday, Monday, so good to me he's just an asshole, man, he never listens. Yeah, well neither does my dad. I wouldn't worry about it. Maybe we could get them together, they could start an assholes club. I know some teachers that belong in that. J' that Monday evenin' you would still be here with me > Monday, Monday, I can't trust that day > Monday, Monday, sometimes it just turns out that way > oh Monday morning you gave me no warning of what was to be Hey guys, some good work. Oh look, if it isn't the great poet himself. Did you guys see this shit? No, what's it all about? The after prom celebration? Yeah, a bunch of 'em were having it at the shanty. I still don't get it. We haven't been here long enough, we are not allowed in. You know what they say, residents only? You gotta be here at least a year, man. They do that? Obviously they can, they're doing it. Just because we're new? I mean shit, our folks are just doing a job. This really pisses me off, I can't believe they'd do that. I can't believe they're allowed to do that. Yeah, well you better believe it, 'cause they are doing it and there's not a thing any of us can do about it. Let's just forget it. Let's get outta here. This really does suck, man. Yeah. Hey, wait up. Hey guys, wait up! Hey look, James is already here. Who cares about him? He doesn't appreciate what he's got. Don't be silly. You know you still love him. I think the only thing that he and his friend, Mark, love, is their damn golf clubs and maybe every other girl at school. Come on, Ginny. I know my brother better than that. I really think you're overreacting. Hey sis. Hi babe, you still mad at me? What did I tell you? She still loves me. Yeah, yeah. Well we better get going if we're gonna get back in time. All right. Where are you guys off to? We're gonna go shoot a few holes. It's called skipping homeroom. That's right. What did I tell you? Golf. Hey, don't get. We'll see you guys later, okay? Bye. Golf before school? You've gotta be kidding. The sad part is he isn't. All right, so you were right. But come on, he's not as bad as all that. He's so damn sure of himself. I'm sorry, I know he's your brother. Hey, all that means is that I have to live with him. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know if he realizes it or not. Just be cool. I know, it is dumb. Hold on a sec, okay Ginny? Are you serious? Just hang on. You gotta be kidding. Hold on a second. It's time for Noreen and me to go public. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? I was just coming over to say hi. Oh well, hi. That's your friend over there, right? Yeah. Why don't you introduce us? Come on, Noreen. Let's get moving. Okay. Bobby, this is Ginny. Ginny, this is Bobby. So you're the musician guy? Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's me. Well, I can see why Noreen's been keeping you a secret. We're going to winchell's for donuts, why don't you come with us? What? Come with us. I don't know, my friend's waiting. Come on. All right, let's go. Okay, lemme just go tell him. What was that all about? Oh, come on, don't be so serious. Um, I think I'll pass. I don't wanna be late for bio again. Come on. No, I'll catch you inside. - All right. - Have fun. He's not gonna go, he is going to class. I'm ready. Okay. You sure? Sure he's sure. Sure I'm sure. Okay, your time is up. Those of you that identified the cell as a white blood cell are correct. This is our friendly leukocyte, a white caucus. This is our friend because it protects us against invading armies of viruses and bacteria. Now, give me your attention up here to the front. Let's move to the bigger part of the blood system, the pump, the heart. Now we've gone over this a great deal but I do want you to remember. Please hold it right there, Mr. Parker. Ladies take your seats. These are class specimens who can't even tell time correctly. Ms Nolan, you're good at looking at the clock. Why don't you tell your classmates just how late they are? 15 minutes. 15, which you will make up when, Mr. Parker? After school, I guess. Thank you very much, we'll talk later. You've disturbed the class enough. Okay. Where were we? Let's shift to the respiratory system, and how the blood affects it. I'm talking about air and lungs. Now, you're all gonna be taking a final in less than six weeks. Look, man, we just went and had some donuts, all right? It's no big deal, I just wanna forget about it. Forget about it? Bobby, you show up late for class with the hottest girl in the school, the girlfriend of the mayor's son, and you say, forget about it? Look, I wasn't with her. I mean, I was with her, but I was with Noreen. Well, either way you're screwed. Why am I screwed? You just shouldn't be seen hanging around with Noreen. Listen, James is gonna freak out. Bobby. What? If you have to, at least play it cool. You know, I'm sick of playing it cool. You must have known that was gonna happen. It's okay. It got Mr. Golf's blood boiling, didn't it? That's not the point. That's exactly the point. Just watch. What the hell is wrong with you? Ah! Don't make a fuss. Beat it, Noreen. You can talk to me with her here. All right, fine. What the hell's going on? Don't make a fuss. You went out to play golf, I went out too. Oh, you went out too. You went out with that Parker scum. He's a transfer Ginny, in case you hadn't noticed. He's a nobody, a nothing. He doesn't mean anything to me. Good. Noreen likes him. Is that so, Noreen? That's great, that's really great. Look, I don't want either one of you seeing the guy, okay? Look, what I do is my business, you don't own me. Fine, you don't wanna listen, I'll speak to Parker myself! I think I better go warn Bobby. Here, you drive. I'll get a ride. You're wasting your time, Noreen. J' there used to be hope for the future > that we could hold in our hearts > a place that we could turn to > when the world tore us apart > but now the picture fades to black j'and hope's so hard to find > we trust ourselves and no one else j'and leave the rest behind > if this is the end, if this stops now > I'd like to take you with me somehow > we'll call it quits and blow it all to bits > and take our final bow > if this is the end Bobby, that was great. Uh, what are you doing here? Did you write that song yourself? Yeah. I mean, it's not done yet. It needs another verse or something. What do you think? You wanna know the truth? Yeah. I hated it. Oh you did? Yes, I hated it. It was the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life. Come on, we gotta go. Why? My brother's planning something really stupid. What else is new? I'm serious, he is. Okay. You don't even know how to dress. I warned you this would happen. Come on, out of my way, junior. I said, take it back! Don't you think we should do something? Maria, we don't want your type here. Susan, leave her alone. Noreen, who's side are you on anyway? Get lost, hedges. And where did you come from anyway? Don't you think she's- - Noreen, just snap out of it! Noreen, forget about it, all right? Come on. Forget it, forget it. Come on you guys, let's go. Come on, you okay? Yes. I'll be looking for you, bitch. Are you okay? Yes. Are you sure? Yes, I'll be okay. I'm gonna go take care of her. Okay. Hey, hey, wait a minute. Can I see you tonight? Yeah, where? How about the shanty? How are you gonna get in there? I don't know, I'll find a way. Okay. Yeah? Go take care of her. Bye. Let's go, we got two more loads to do before we quit. Move it, move it! Let's go, Parker! You gotta make up for being late today. I know, I know. Come on in there, let's move it. Let's go, let's go. Parker. Hey there, pal. We came to lend a hand. I guess you thought I forgot about this morning, huh? Look, I'm working right now, all right? Oh yeah, you're working all right. Making time with my girlfriend. How about me and you talk about this some other time, all right? Talk about what? Talk about going out with Ginny and Noreen? Whoa, whoa, you mean he went out with one of our girls? Yeah. Oh. I'm sorry, I wasn't sure they were your girls. Oh. I went out with Noreen and, uh.. And? And nothing. You thought you were smooth this morning, buddy. |'|| tell you. Get him up! Get him up! Hit him! Hit him, James, hit him! Hold him still. Hit him again, James, come on! Hit him! You transfer in and now you think you can take over? Look, I don't wanna take nothing, all right? Yeah! Drop him. Oh shit, the boss! Come on, guys, let's get outta here. So they made it residents only just six months ago? Yeah. Right about the time they started bringing the workers in to build a power plant. And of course, to be a resident you have to be here at least a year. But it doesn't matter, I mean, who needs them anyway? Yeah. Hey, guys. Hey Bobby, I thought you were at work. Yeah, well not anymore. What happened, Bobby? James and some of his girlfriends paid me a little visit and I got fired. What kind of town is this? Yeah, well welcome to the club. So what? We should just accept it? Whatever, what can we do? I don't know, but I'm not so sure we just accept it. Can I get you anything? Yeah. Um, no, no, no. Thanks. J' hey, hey, hey > hurry up, child > my sweet, sweet child > hurry up, child hey. How'd you get in? I just came in. Through the kitchen with an apron on. I'm glad you're here. Yeah, me too. Well?

And the waiter says, that's the fourth time she's asked for broccoli, right? Yeah. So he goes, "ma'am spell as in dogmatic." She goes, d-o-g. And he goes, "spell the cat as in caterpillar." She goes, c-a-t. But I really don't... Now spell the... Now spell the... Hey! Oh man, come on. "If this is the end", an original masterpiece by Bobby Parker. Come on, let me read it.

Oh well, that's all right 'cause last night him and some of his little friends jumped all over me about you. He's got this thing about the town, you're either from town or you're not, and you're not. Yeah. Well, you know, he's just gonna have to live with it. Why? Why? Why? Because you're gonna go to the prom with me, right? I'd love to. I'd love to. You'd love to. I'd love to. This Is cold. Why don't you order something else. What? You want that shit they call a taco? Now come on, tacos aren't so bad. Yeah, how would you know? All you've been doing is eating caviar lately. What are you talking about? I'm talking about somebody who doesn't know his place. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Riley. No, no, no. I guess you're too good now to hang out with the rest of us, huh Bobby? And what do you mean by that, Nancy? You were at the club last night. Yeah, so what? So, it's true. I guessed you were there. Why Bobby, with who? Why? What differences it make? I'm going again anyway. Hey, I'm not gonna put up with this bullshit, man. I'll tell you what's bullshit, Riley. What's bullshit is sitting around here eating this bullshit food. So what would you like us to do, huh? Well, I don't know. What's tonight? Friday. Oh, you are so smart. Where is everybody? Hmm, hanging out? The club. So let's go to the club. Bobby, you'll get killed. Okay, I'll go by myself. I'm with you. No. Hey, wait a minute. I'm gonna go with you, 'cause I wanna see you get your head handed to you. Well, I'm going. Come on. Come on, Maria. I've never seen you guys before, you got some ID? Um... Come on man, I don't have the whole night. If you don't have what I need, get out. All right. Give me one sec, all right? This was not a good idea. Just give me one second. Just give me as much money as you got, all right? Just trust me, Riley. How are you doing? Have a good one tonight, huh? There you go, man. Looks good to me. Thanks. Move it. Charming, that was all the money we had. What do we do for drinks? What the hell do I know. I got us in, didn't I? J' always keep your brother by your side > your brother is an enemy of mine > don't he know that I don't like his kind > he says you're his sweetest little sister > but I'll make you mine so far so good. Yeah. We should go to the back bar. Ah, the back bar? Are you kidding? No, we're here man, why the hell not? Sure. J' 80 come on sister, won't you decide > show me what you really feel inside > don't just do what your big brother tells you to do > you can jump in my car Hey, can we have two beers? Holding out on me, huh? Oh yeah, I've been holding out big time bro. Big time. This is great. Yeah, not too bad. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. All right. Thanks. How's it going? Hey, can I get a water please? Psst, you hear with anybody? You couldn't stand to be away from me. No. Well, actually I was just in the neighborhood, so. I brought a few friends with me, I wanna show you off to them. Not too shabby. Yeah? Well, should we have a seat? Yeah. I came here with Ginny. She came here with James, Bobby. So what? So maybe we should... Hey Noreen. Have you got any smokes? Well, look here. I didn't know they started letting the help in. It's nice to see you too, Ginny. Yuck, what is this crap? It's alcohol, Ginny. I think you've had enough. Impossible, you can never have too much. Isn't that right, Bobby? Yeah, I guess so. You could write a song about it. Call it, "never too much alcohol". Yeah, I think you're onto something there. Hmm, flatterer. Well, they have started to let everyone in, haven't they? Bobby, you got us in here man, now let's go. Yeah Bobby, let's get outta here. Okay. You proved your point, Bobby, but we're not gonna stay where we're not welcome. You children can go, the adults are staying. Bobby, are you coming or what? Yeah, I'm coming. Susan didn't teach you too good the other day, did she, grease ball? Ginny, calm down. Look, I'm sorry. Who are you are you calling a grease ball, you tight ass gringo? You. Hey man, is that Ginny? No, Maria! Maria! Get her outta here! I'll take care of it guys, come on. Hey, hey Bobby, what the hell was that all about? I don't know, man. This place is nuts. What the hell's going on here? Okay, listen. Give me a minute, all right? We're gonna take care of this, just give a minute. Is she all right? Yeah. Bill, make sure they get her out, all right? Hey, no problem. I'll meet you at the car. Yeah. Lori, get your ass over here. I'll be right back. I gotta go talk to him, just wait here. What? Listen, I don't care if you wanna ruin your life, that's up to you. But I don't want you doing it on my territory. Would you knock it off, James? I'm serious, I want him gone, in one piece or two. But I want him gone, now! You know, James... I think you better leave. Yeah why, huh? Is that what you want? Or was that what James told you? No, I don't want you to go, but I think things are gonna get really crazy around here. What's gonna happen, huh? Look! Just go, Bobby, go! Okay, okay. Let's fuck him up. Come on. My keys! Bobby, need a lift? Where are we going? I don't know where, just out of there. Did you have fun at the club tonight? The time of my life. Hmm. I just wanna thank you for that, Ginny. Oh Bobby, the only reason why I did that is because you turn me on. Lighten up, all right? Look Ginny, look around, there's nobody here, okay? I know, it's perfect. Look, I got enough trouble with James as it is. James is boring, just like everybody else in this town. But you, you are not boring, Bobby. Come on, I thought Noreen was your best friend, huh? Shh, don't think about her. Look Ginny, you're really drunk, okay? Why don't you just climb in the back, all right? Only if you get in the back with me, Bobby. Ginny! Jesus, look out! Ginny? Oh man. Ginny come on, say something. Come on, Ginny. Help me here. Come on now. You're gonna be okay, Ginny. Come on. Get me outta here. I've got bail. Can I get anything to read around here? Yeah, I got the wall street journal, pal. All right buddy, let's go. Rise and shine. Hey listen, man. Can you just talk to me for one second, please? Talk to him, he's driving me crazy. You shut up. What do you want, kid? Can you just tell me how she's doing? That's all I wanna know. Well, she's real bad kid. I hope you're proud of yourself. Wait a minute. What do you mean bad? I mean, how bad? What is bad? I don't know, kid. I'm not a doctor, okay? Okay. I just, um... Can you tell me when I'm gonna get outta here? I ain't the judge either. Thanks, I appreciate that. Oh man, I thought you guys got rid of me. Well, we didn't. Bobby, are you all right? Yeah, I am okay. Look, just get me outta here, okay? I'm afraid that's not so easy. Why not? Look, we don't have time. Just relax. Now we think your son has been drinking and driving, now that's a criminal offense no matter what the age. And he almost killed a girl in the process. She's okay, isn't she? Look, I was just trying to get out of there and save my ass. So you keep saying. Barnes. Look, I'll vouch for him, just bring him down to my custody. Look, until we talk to the girl, we don't know what happened. What do you think we're gonna do, skip town? With your status in town, that has to be a real consideration. My status in town? What kind of crap is that, huh? Dad. Do you know what I do? Do you know what I do? Dad! I got a respectable job, that's what I do! Just listen! We'll know more in a couple of days, but until then- - for Christ sakes, I didn't break any laws, did I? How about that kidnapping charge, huh? Barnes. What are you talking about? The girl's boyfriend claims that she was taken against her will. I don't believe this. You didn't tell us about that. What other lie have you got hanging around out there? Dad i- - don't you dad me. And here I am trying to defend you, jerk! Listen, I... Bobby? Hmm? You know, I wanna believe you. But you're making it real hard. I know. Well they're right, mom. I did kidnap her. See, it was all part of my master plan that I had. I was gonna hijack a plane to South America, and hold her for ransom. Actually it was just the beginning of a much larger plan to take over the entire world. This is what I really was gonna do. Hey, can we get some service here? Jesus! Come on. Look, Riley, Bobby's supposed to be our friend. I say we do whatever it takes to help him out. He got himself into this. Oh, so we're just gonna let him rot? Let him rot? The guy leads us into the club and then he takes off, and leaves us all standing there alone. He didn't know anything was gonna happen. Yeah, well he should have waited. Or maybe he was just a little too anxious to get into that bitch's pants. Ah, come on. That's not true and you know it. I don't know anything. Miss! Miss, can we get some service when you get a chance, please? I mean, this is... This is crazy, man. Hey, excuse me. Can I get some service here? Talk to my boss, okay? What do you mean talk to your boss? Is there something you need? Yeah, I'd like a couple of cheeseburgers. Well, you have to wait your turn. Yeah, well I've been waiting a long time. You don't like the service? You can always go somewhere else. I mean, we don't need any accidents happening here. What kind of attitude is that? No attitude. It's your choice, kid. Excuse me, sorry about that. Come on, Riley. What an asshole! It's all right. Come on. Let's just forget about it, we'll go somewhere else. Up yours. Come on, Riley. Hey, that's another thing we can thank Bobby for. Okay, up and out! You, up and out! What's going on? Well you leave, I guess, the girl's gonna be okay. Thank god. So I'm not gonna keep you. I just hope you appreciate the break. Yeah, I do. Wait a minute. There's still some questions unsettled that you're gonna have the answer to. Look, man. I'll answer any questions you want. In fact, ask her if you want, she'll tell you. She can't tell me anything. I mean, her jaws are wired, memory very hazy. Oh Jesus! Look, kid, I think I know what went down. I just want you to keep your nose clean. Let it blow over, it'll be okay. Okay. Hey, else I wouldn't let you go. Okay. All right. Oh god. You're Parker? I am. Bobby. I'm sorry. They're saying you'll be okay. Get some rest, all right? Oh, you've come to admire your handy-work? Look man, I feel bad, all right? Just leave me alone. Yeah yeah, listen, stay away from my sister. I don't want you hurting her too, you understand? No, you understand. You've got no idea how this happened, man, none. And if I told you it would make things worse. Spare made your bullshit. Spare me yours. Stay away. All right, here you go guys. All right, thanks bud. Hey look, James man. I don't know, but I think this whole idea is pretty stupid. Hey, I'm sorry you feel that way about it, chip, but I think it's the only answer. Hell, why'd you have him bring it if you're not gonna use it? It doesn't make any sense. Look, have I ever misled you guys before? I haven't, right? Right. The guy is an asshole, he's got it coming. All right, well you're not gonna load it, right? We'll have to, we'll use blanks, you know? He'd know if it wasn't loaded. It's just to scare him. Sure. Well, when? Monday, before bio, we'll get him on his way to class. All right, you guys. James, do you think you can give me a ride home? Yeah, no problem. What was that? What was that? That was nothing. That was one of Mark's toys, just a toy. We'll see you, guy. - All right, hey. - All right, man. Have a good weekend guys. All right. Hey, and relax. What's up? What was that all about? That? That was nothing. That was a class assignment for Monday. That was a gun. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but that's not important to you. James, if you're mad at Bobby, you should- - what? You'll run and tell him, huh? I didn't say that. Look, it's bad enough that my girlfriend's almost been killed because of him. Now my own sister's crossing me? Why do you automatically just hate him? You're being an idiot about this whole thing. I'm not being an idiot, I'm trying to do what's best for you. Can't you understand that? How would you know what's best for me? But he's a transfer. He doesn't belong. Who died and voted you god? Look, I don't want you to see him at all! You're not listening as usual. I don't care what you have to say. My own sister, a traitor. I don't need a ride. You're a goddamn traitor, Noreen. Do you think he's gonna hurt you? Yeah, is that what you think? Bobby, I said he had a gun. Yeah, I know, I heard you. I'm worried. So what do you want me to do? I don't know. This whole thing is outta control, I don't know. So what are you saying? What are you telling me, huh? Why don't you just say it? What, are you scared? Is that it, you're scared? Gee, I'm scared too. So what are we gonna do? I don't know. If this is too much for you, I mean, if you can't handle it, then all you gotta do is say so, and I'm gone. But if you want... I mean, if you want me, even half as much as I want you, then I don't care what James or his friends, or anyone in this whole goddamn town has to say. Because I'm yours. I wanna stay with you, Bobby. I love you. Look, you guys, I told you what happened, and that's it. Come on, we gotta all stick together on this thing. Yeah right, is that why he left us standing in the club alone? Oh come on, Riley. You didn't hear a word he said. Yeah, well look, he's the one who led us on this stupid invasion. Not a good idea to begin with. You had to get us in trouble because you have to put a town girl in the hospital. Yeah, what were you doing with her in the first place, huh? Yeah, let me get this straight, now there's a gang after you? Yeah, there is. None of this would've been happening if you weren't fooling around with those girls. None of this. Jesus, you guys are as bad as they are. Yeah look, just forget him. You're messing things up for us, Bobby. Lotta of help they were. What'd you expect? There's nothing they can do anyway. Hey, is James really gonna bring a gun? I don't know. I mean, that's what she said. She sounded pretty serious. Jesus! Bobby, I don't wanna tell you what to do, but... Well how much do you like this girl? Is she worth it? Man, she is... She is worth all of it. Come on, I'll race you. Oh yeah? Come on man, I got boots on. What's up guys. Oh shit man, you're serious. You're damn right. Is it loaded? Of course it is. Why didn't you use blanks. I couldn't find any. I mean, I guess it's all right if you don't really use it. Well, we shouldn't have to. Here Mark, you carry it. Hey, what if we get caught though? Who's gonna know? It's just us and Parker. 80 guys, before bio lab, right? Right, we'll get him on his way to class. All right then, see you guys. Yo Parker! Your ass is toast, man. Yeah. Well, I figure you should want my ass, chip. James is the one that wants it, asshole. Well, he knows where to find it. Yeah? I got a little news for you, buddy. Today after school, when we're alone, you're dead man, you're history. I'll blow it out your ass, chip. Hey well, maybe I'll finish you off right here, huh? Are you sure? All by yourself? You don't need a little help? Hey punk, where do you think you're going? Enough! Enough, right now! Enough! Hey, he started it. That's bullshit, man. I'm sure you all have classes to go to, now. You pick up your bag and I'll see you in detention hall after school. But Mr. McMahon, I didn't- - go! And you can come with me. Mikeila, get me chief woods on the phone. Yes, sir. You. Just sit there. Yes. Yeah, this is McMahon at the high school. It's about the Parker boy. I see. Yes, if you say so. Well, they did let you out. What did you think I did, escape? No wise talk. One thing I don't need is wise talk. I'm sorry. And I won't stand for anymore from you. Can I go now? You may return to your classes, but I'll be watching you, you can count on it. Watching me do what? I'm well aware what you did to Ms. Amsden. Look, that was an accident. And I won't stand for a repeat performance here. Look, I just wanna graduate and get out, do you understand? Oh, believe me, I understand your type all too well, Parker. My type. Listen- - no, no you listen. That'll be enough. What about chip? - I said that's enough. - Good day, mr Parker. Thanks. Hey Parker. How you doing, bud? I'm doing great. That's good. Having a good Monday? Yeah, it's fabulous. It's even gonna get better. Order in the court. What is this shit? I said, order in the court! What are the charges? Well, your honor, what we have here is a case of complete stupidity. The defendant, Bobby Parker, is hereby accused with first degree harassment of the judge's sister and girlfriend, as well as failure to comply to the warnings of this court. And generally being a trailer park scum. How do you plead? Uh, I guess I have to plead that you guys are a bunch of assholes. Gosh, that's not very nice. Now is it, Bobby? Considering that we've been waiting here for you for a very long time. You've been found guilty. I will now administer sentence. Fellows, the weapon please. Your honor. All right, come on. You guys gotta be kidding me, right? I told you just stay away from Ginny, and look what happened? I told you to stay away from Noreen, still you don't listen. Parker? I think it's about time you learn. Go ahead, James. Don't let him get away! So you see Tommy, why this muscle would, of necessity, have to be under a layer of subcutaneous fat. I know all that, but what I don't understand is why it is under a layer- - Look, I'm sorry. These guys are still coming after me. Parker, what is wrong with you? Are you on something? No, just look! What is this? Nobody comes to class on time anymore? Look, I'm sorry mr kasabian, it's just a Parker here was... Look, we will take care of this after class. Now all of you, take a seat. No, we still need to finish this. Hey come on, James. This can wait. No! What are you gonna do James, huh? You're gonna blow me away right here in front of everybody? Mr. Hedges, take a seat now. I said, take a seat! Hey relax, man! All right? Relax! Listen to me. Look, it can wait, all right? It can wait. Come on. Take it easy. Now, I'm absolutely shocked at this behavior. By all of you. You're a dead man! Is this what you want, James? Oh my god, he's got a gun! He brought it here! Let me go! Someone will get hurt. Stop it! You killed him! What? You shot him. What are you talking about? You killed him! You're a fucking murderer! I didn't! Look at him, he's goddamn fucking dead! I didn't do this. Is he dead or what? Jesus, this is unbelievable. Bobby, are you okay? Someone needs to check if he's all right. Shit, man. I don't believe this shit! I'll go look, stay here. Help, help, help. Sorry, teacher. Jesus Christ! You're getting his blood all over my shirt, stop! So what's the story? Is he okay? He's dead. Parker is too good a shot. No look, all three of us had the gun when it went off. Bullshit, man! No way, man, I saw it. You were the one that went for the gun. Yeah, I did too. Who else saw it? Yeah, it was Bobby. It looked like it was him. Come on, it looked like him, but that doesn't mean it was him. Maria, Nancy? I don't know, Bobby looked like he- - Bobby, you were the one that went for the gun. She's right? Yeah, she's right. You see Parker? Even your friends saw you do it. Some friends. Look, so what if went for the gun? Did any one of you see what happened out there, huh? I'm not getting blamed for this. Bad move putting the gun down. Fuck you. Get over here. You ain't going nowhere, killer! What the hell are you guys doing? Hey, we've gotta hold him for the authorities. Listen, chip, Tommy and you, move this shelf, move it against the door. Come on, now! James, you can't do this. Look, I'm not getting blamed for this, you asshole. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to be blamed, in jail. Look, he's our friend, you guys. Shut your hole, man! Unless you're gonna help, shut your hole! This is such bullshit, you guys. Of course you'd say that, man. Let him have his say, you guys don't know him like I do. Yeah, coming from a traitor, huh? No, if there's an explanation, I think we should listen. There's no big explanation! Look, he brought a gun! I took it from him, and I'm telling you all three of us had it. You are such a liar. No, I'm not. I didn't do this. Maybe he's right, we didn't see it. Yeah, she's right. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys. I don't believe what I'm hearing. The guy's new, right? So what does that show? Do we really know this guy? Look what he did, look what he did to Ginny. What are you talking about? Yeah right. Now look what he's done to kasabian. He's got to pay. You know, you were the one that brought the gun first, James. Don't forget that. I brought it to teach him a lesson. Yeah, I can vouch for that. He's the one that used it. All right, that's it! Nobody move! You down, go! Uh-uh, Tommy. Inside. You're the boss. Bobby, be careful. Bobby, what are you doing? Look Bobby, don't shoot, okay? Why? You're so ready to blame me for this, huh? Maybe I oughta give you something to blame me for. What the hell is going on in here? It's Bobby, he shot Mr. Kasabian, and now he's gonna shoot us. Look, stop! Turn around and leave. I said, stop. Get out. Why are you doing this? Oh, come on McMahon. You know my type, don't you? We just do this shit for fun. Son, we can still work this out. No, it's too late for that! Okay. Nancy, lock the door. Bill, the rest of you guys, move that thing in front of it. Sure, anything. Nancy, why don't you push from the back? Come on. All right. Now, everybody just sit down. Let's take it easy, Bobby. What's the point of all this? Parker here has just figured out that he's in deep shit. No one's going anywhere right now, I just uh... I just gotta think for a second. Well, think about what? What hostage you're gonna shoot first? I don't wanna shoot anybody. Oh, well yeah. Well you'll forgive us if we don't believe you, huh? Look, I'm not getting blamed this time. Well, I'm certainly not. What? What about us? I don't care who did what or why. Can I leave? I never said you couldn't. I'm not the one holding you here. If you have to go, speak to Parker here. James, you're an asshole. This is police chief, woods. I'm addressing the Chief woods, we're being held hostages up here! Get away from there! From bad to worse. Just sit there and don't move! Bill, move that shade. Lower it down there. Yeah, sure. He's not gonna hurt us, right? He wouldn't. Do we know anything yet? We had the school principal. He says the gunman is a senior, name of Bobby Parker, been in trouble before. Parker? Wasn't he the one with the accident a few days ago? It's the same guy. That's right. Great. Look, we gotta be careful here. These are kids and they can't get hurt. What about for press? Keep them away. Tell them as little as possible. What about the special team? Look, I want them up in those trees as far as possible without being seen. But under no circumstances are they to fire except by my orders. Done. Look, scope out the whole building. I wanna know how many ways in, how many ways out, and how many he can see. Will do. Find out what you can about the kid. Why is he doing this? Any history of mental illness. Oh, and arrange to have the parents brought in. Right away. This is the head of the school, he was inside. He knows the situation. So what can you tell me. It's a lab, biology, there's about a dozen kids in there. They blocked the door. The teacher's probably dead. Are you sure? I didn't see him, but somebody said he'd been shot. What about the gunman? Parker? I don't know much, he's new. His family just brought in. He never caused any trouble until... Yeah, until he almost killed a girl. Now I've gotta figure out if he's loony. What do you think? He seemed excited, tense. Well, tell me something I don't know. Well, I think... I'm not sure, but I think your son is in there. Oh, wonderful news. Bobby, you realize this is only gonna get worse. Parker, just wait and see what happens when my dad hears that I'm up here. Bobby, what are we gonna do about this blood, huh? Look. I don't know. Just gimme a minute, all right? Bobby. Oh, now you're looking to be an accessory, Noreen? Oh, Christ. Don't you ever shut up? Just forget about him. It's not too late, think about what you're doing. I know. Look, I'm just... I'm not sure what I'm doing, okay? It's just how we gotta play it for now, right? Well, we got nowhere to go. I have got to change this blouse. Hey, you think maybe you could stop whining just for a second, huh? Maybe the guy has met his match, all right? Look, I'm not trying to be anybody's match, but I'm not gonna get blamed for murder. What's happening outside? Yeah, we need to know that. Bill, check the windows, all right? Yeah, sure. The big black cop is coming towards the building. The big black cop is the chief of police, and my dad. Is he alone? It looks that way, it's kind of hard to tell. You're gonna be locked up for murder, Parker. Murder? Shit, you're in deep, bud. You're not gonna see daylight for years. Yeah Parker, be careful of those big smelly guys who invite you to bend over. Look, would you just shut up for one second? Or what? Are you gonna kill me too? Dios mio, will you shut up? Hey, who the hell invited you to speak? What have I ever done to you? This is chief woods again. I had to come into the school. Don't say a goddamn word. Okay, I don't need to. I need to know what is going on. Look I'm alone. Bobby, talk to him. Parker, answer me. Hey, you're famous now, Parker. Shut up! Parker, I'm willing to follow your rules, but you're gonna have to talk. What should I say? Just wait a minute! Fine son, fine. Now, whatever you want, you just tell me. I'm here to help you. Uh, I don't want anything. Why are you doing this? Look, I'm not doing anything. I can't hear you. What am I gonna do? I mean, we go out there and he tells his story and I tell mine, who do you think they're gonna believe? I don't know. Maybe I ought to just let everybody go. Yeah, you're right, Parker. Now's a good time to dismiss the jury, 'cause I think we all know where we stand. - So do I. - I agree. Leave him alone. Come on, let us go. Oh thank god, we need to get out of here. Parker, I can't hear anything. Sit down and wait! Shit man. Look, everything's okay here. I'd like you to leave now, please. I'm sorry, I need to know more. Now how is everyone else? They're fine! Just get out now, okay? Look son- - Chief woods! I don't want this to get any worse than it is. Worse? For Christ's sake how could it get any worse? He's losing it guys. Chill out, man. Hey man, you lost it a long time ago. Parker, listen. No! You listen, all right? Wake up, kids. Now get out! Okay, okay. Relax. I'm going. You two stay out of sight, but be ready. I'm worried. Shit. Help me get him out of here. Get the paramedics. I'm sorry. They're probably getting help to blow you away, Parker. And what the hell is with you, James? Excuse me, hello? Hello? What? Look, I'm sorry. But after that, I gotta go to the restroom. How? What do you mean, how? I mean, what do you want us to do? You want us to move all the stuff out of the way and then put it all back? I don't know, I gotta go. Man, when you gotta go, you gotta go. That's right, man. Bobby, come on. Nobody's leaving right now. Oh, we're back to being hostages now again, huh? I can't wait. What about the washroom in the front of the room? I've never been back there. Well, it has a sink at least. I'm not gonna use a sink. Bill, will you check it out? Yeah, right. It's a little cramped, but who needs luxury? Look, let me leave. I'll come right back. It's not funny. Of course not. Hey man, it's getting stuffy in here. Can you at least open a window? Hey Carol, how's it going in there? I can't go with you all listening. Who's listening? I'm not, I'm not listening. I think he's listening. Look, go or don't go, but do it now. Parker, give the girl a break. Come on, I can't. I'm too scared. She's too much. Hey, there's something happening outside. Come on, Carol. Look, maybe if you all did something, I could believe you weren't listening. Yeah, we can all punch Bobby's face. What do you want us to do, sing? Yeah, that would be good. Is she serious? Yeah, let's sing a song. Come on, you know a song, chip, why don't you sing a song, come on. We're gonna sing a song here. Okay, let's sing a song then. I think we should sing something we all know. How about, row, row, row your boat? Okay? Row, row, row your- ready? And... J' row, row, row your boat > gently down the stream > merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily > life is but a dream > row, row, row your boat no, but the paramedics have the teacher and they're stabilizing him inside. Hey, what the hell is going on here? Have they all gone nuts? I don't know. I've got the kids' parents though. Well, get 'em! This is Vicky Wallace for channel 10 news, standing outside oceana high school where a student has taking an unknown number of his classmates hostage. Police chief Bart woods is currently heading the negotiations. And police chief, can we get a comment from you please? Hi, unfortunately at this time we don't have any sort of comment. Are you at least able to indicate what the gunman's demands are and how many are currently being held? No, not really. No comment. What about reports that drugs are behind this latest round of teenage violence in our school? Look, there's no indication that that is the case. Now, if you'll excuse me. Well, as you can see the police chief has no comment at this time, but we are reporting to you live. This is Vicky Wallace with Chanel 10 news. You remember the Parkers don't you? It can't be Bobby, it just can't be. Just what's going on here? Look, to be quite honest with you, Mr. Parker, I'm not sure. Now I know students are being held, a teacher is shot, and your son has a gun. Yeah? Well he didn't get it from me. But where did he get it from? I don't know where he got it from. Oh you wouldn't, would you? You never pay any attention to him at all, do you? That's not true. Listen, I've got a situation here. And what about friends, hobbies? Well, he likes to write songs. His friends are no good. What about the accident? I don't know. I didn't talk to him about it. I just thought he was causing trouble for us again. Dammit frank, I told you we should have believed him. I'm gonna send someone in to check his locker for other weapons. Now, do you have any other suggestions? I don't know. I just don't know. Everything come out okay? You're so crude. Hey man. Hey Bobby, it looks like your parents are down there. Oh, dragging your family to this, Parker? Why don't you just lay off the guy, hedges, all right? What, are you taking the killers side? I'm not taking sides. You know, I'm just starting to realize that you want us to hang this guy based on your say so. It's the truth. And what makes you so sure it was him? Not you too! Not another fucking traitor! Hey, well why'd you bring the gun when I told you not to, James? Dammit, that's it! Sit down. No, I can't stand it anymore. It's not that bad. That's not what I'm talking about. I have got to get this blood off of this blouse. Oh, do we get to watch? Oh, you need the gunman's permission. If it'll shut her up, I don't care what she does. What can I change into? I don't think you need to wear anything. I think there's a jacket around here somewhere. You need us to sing or something while you change your shirt? You can sing if you want to, but I won't hear you. Do you feel safe letting that little girl undress alone? Maybe you oughta go help her with your big, strong gun. Look, James, if you keep pushing me, I'm gonna have to shut you up one way or another, okay? Oh, okay. Hey Bobby. Don't worry about it, huh? Come on, you don't wanna shoot anyone in cold blood. No, no, I don't want to, but I don't really see any other way out of this right now. Bobby, you could just let everybody go, please. Yeah, if you're ready face those people in prison, Parker. Yeah, what's taking Susan so long? How long does it take to change a blouse? Maybe she went out the other door. - What? - What? What door? The other door in the back. Sit. Bill, you go check it out, all right? Yeah, sure. Why didn't you leave? I didn't know where it went and I didn't wanna get shot. There is a second door, Bobby. It leads into the chemistry lab, she's gone. It's okay. It's okay, relax. Relax. It's horrible. He's got a gun, he's crazy. He said he's gonna start killing people. Who is? Bobby, Bobby Parker. Come on, what could she possibly say? I don't know, but it's probably not gonna help. Not gonna help? I can guarantee she's out there frying your ass right now. You are such an idiot, man. A complete sucker, you know that? Well, she got outside and she's on TV. The morning of terror has ended for one of the youth, Susan pensive, a senior here at- - that's pevensi. Yes. Susan, can you describe the violence in the classroom? Oh, well he had a gun. Bobby did, Bobby Parker. He had this gun and I was so scared that he was gonna use it. We'll keep you updated. For channel 10 news, I'm Vicki Wallace. Do you believe her? I don't know what to believe, but we gotta try something. Yeah, like what? I wanna get a message inside to my son. Isn't that risky? How? With this note. Where's the mountain dew? Right here. Whoa, whoa, what's that gonna do? Look, my son swears by mountain dew so he'll get the note. Which says what? Which says to throw open the blinds exactly at three o'clock. Then we'll be able to see for ourselves. What if it doesn't last till then? Then he'll open them in case of emergency. He's got to know that. Shall I bring them in? I'll come with you, he's already talked to me. Now what about the teacher? The paramedics should have him by now. Sharpshooters? They're still watching. Great. Look, see if you can get the principal to show you something; Files, lockers, something. - Okay. - Let's go. Chief woods, what are you bringing in now? Is it one of the gunman's demands? Yeah, pizza. So the first of the gunman's demands, pizza, has been provided. Parker, let me talk to my son. Yeah, go ahead. Parker, I'm waiting. Yeah, dad. Hey, how are you? I'm fine son. I'm fine. How's everything in there? Well, it's pretty wild, but... No, I mean anyone hurt or anything? Nah. Some people are pretty worried, but we're all okay. Good, good. You see, son, I brought some food for everyone, pizza. That's just great, dad. I also brought some sodas, I even got your favorite, mountain dew. All right, thanks. Well, where do I put them? Tell him the door, then leave. Dad, put the food by the door, then leave. Okay. And tell Parker, it's time he made up his mind. Bill, chip, you guys move that stuff. What are you doing? Taking orders from him now? Hey, I'm hungry. All right, man? Yeah, I'll take a little pie. Give me one of those too. Get that thing back in front of the door. Yeah, Maria, you wanna help me? Hey, save a slice for us guys, okay? What are you doing? That's mine. Fuck you, it's mine now. Well if you're gonna cry about it, I'll take anything. All right, thanks. What's this? Holy shit! Mark, what time do you got? It's just after two. Great. Well Parker, did you enjoy your last meal? Because I'm sure chief wood's gonna be sending a bullet up for dessert. Why don't you come off it, James? Yeah man, this is getting old real fast. Just grow up. Seriously, James, you should see how stupid you look. I'm stupid, huh? I look stupid? Is that right, Noreen? I look stupid? Do I look stupid, huh! You fucking bitch! If you hadn't betrayed your friends and family for the piece of shit, none of this would have fucking happened! You're nothing but a whore, Noreen, a whore! This is the end, I wanna take you with me somehow. We'll blow it all to bits. It was stuck to his locker. Shit, this changes everything. How? Jesus, this sounds like he planned everything, and that he plans to kill everybody and himself. What do you want me to do? Look, we can't take any risk. Get on and warn the sharpshooters. Tell them, the first shot they get, take it. All right. You can't do it, Parker. I'll do fine. Everyone just settle down. I'm the one in charge and he can't get away! No. See, I got the gun, and I say this is done. It's over. Not after what you've done to me. Not after what you've done my sister! You made her a traitor and she turned against me. You put my... You put my girlfriend away, you put her in the hospital! You just shot the goddamn teacher! No, you can't do this to me, okay? Come on, come on! This guy can't get away with this. Come on, we gotta make him pay for this. Look at what he's done, come on. Well, to hell with all of you! To hell with all of you 'cause I don't need you! Because I am in charge here. It's over. Is it over? I gotta go again. Look man, that's it. That's it, man. You just went too far. You know, James, why don't you just let the adults fix things, all right? Bobby, I don't believe this. What is it? Hey, what's going on? Kasabian's still alive. - So nobody's dead? - What? - Yes! - Yeah! Yeah, fucking a, man! All right. So what was this all about, James? We're all finally going to get out of here. I thought you said you checked him, man. I did. Yeah, but you said he was dead. Bobby, this is great. Now kasabian can set the record straight. Yeah, he will. Everything's gonna be okay. Fuck! What happened? There were shots. Who fired them? I don't know, I think they were ours. You think? Find out dammit! Repeat, shots just fired in this the third hour of a standoff between a student and local police. Maria, I need some help. Come on! Get some help! Wake up, you're gonna be all right. Come on, hurry! I got the gun. I got the gun, okay? Relax, everybody relax. Okay? The police are gonna be here any minute, all right? So listen, we need Tommy and bill, you get over there, you open the window and tell the police what's going on. Open all the blinds up, okay? We need you, chip, Nancy and Carol to unblock the door, get the door unblocked, okay? And then you and me, Mark, you and me, we're gonna tell the police what happened, everything, okay? When they come in, just you and me, man. You were gonna let kasabian bleed to death. Come on! When I give an order I want you to move! - Shut up! - Shut up! Come on! Goddammit bill! It's over, James. Attention Parker, play time's over. I'm coming in, we're all armed. What's that? I'm not sure. You hear me, Parker? We're coming in and we will shoot. Don't shoot. Come here, man. You all right? Yeah, I'm all right, man. That shot, it hit Parker. He's in there with a bullet in him. Don't worry, the paramedics are on their way. Get them in now. What's happening in there? Okay. Let's go. Move it, please. Move it, move it. He's doing okay. Oh my god, Bobby. He's he gonna be okay? It looks that way. What's gonna happen to him now? Maybe nothing, I need more details. Can I ride with him? Yeah. I'm going too. Come on. Let's break it up everybody, back up. Break it up. Well, they had Bobby in the hospital for two weeks, intensive care. He got a lot of attention on the television and in the papers, and overnight all of us became celebrities. The police didn't know who to prosecute, so when our teacher recovered they pretty much dropped the whole thing. Soon everyone else forgot about it too. James, all but vanished from the town. I never did find out what happened to him. Bobby eventually returned to classes with the rest of us. Graduation came, and we all went on with our lives. But somehow we knew, all of us, that despite everything nothing had really changed. > There used to be hope for the future > that we could hold in our hearts > a place that we could turn to > when the world tore us apart > but now the picture fades to black > and hope's so hard to find > we trust ourselves and no one else > and leave the rest behind > if this is the end > if this stops now > I'd like to take you with me somehow > we'll call it quits and blow it all to bits > and take our final bow > if this is the end > ooh > ooh > we were told the time was coming > a chance to state at our case > but tough love to you fellow > if you don't know your place > it shouldn't make a difference > where you're from or who you know > if all the spots > There's nowhere left to go > if this is the end > if this stops now > I'd like to take you with me somehow > we'll call it quits and blow it all to bits > and take our final bow > if this is the end > Let's take a ride in the night > leave town and head out of sight > don't you know the darkness will > you're the only thing that I got > can't you tell it means a lot > it's no fantasy > can't you see > take a chance with me > until the morning light, yeah > if this is the end > if this stops now > I'd like to take you with me somehow > we'll call it quits and blow it all to bits > and take our final bow > if this is the end > if this stops now > Monday, Monday, I can't take that day > Monday, Monday, sometimes it just turns out that way > oh Monday mornin' you gave me no warnin' of what was to be > oh Monday, Monday, how could you leave and not take me > Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday > Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday
