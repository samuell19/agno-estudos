Thank you for your hard work. Two tops in my company have finally meet. Ozaki and Tsuburaya, please continue to work hard. President, you can't say there are two tops. I'm team A's top right? If you are easily hotheaded like this. You can't be top. Right, President? Ah. It's almost time for me to water my plants. Yeah. Keep working hard. I'm number one (top). No, I'm number one (top). Fate has brought them together. They put a bet on their own prides to become top. This unique love story has begun. You're Tsuburaya? Yeah. So? I will let you know that I'm better than you.

Such a new way to exercise. Tsuburaya, I've heard rumour about your beauty. But you are more beautiful than they described. You too. You are also more handsome than they described. Now I understand why they call you as the perfect piece made by God. I also heard that you can raise one's beauty standard. Then, see you later. Wait. Here. This is my number. I must get to know such a beautiful person. Are you... Gay? I'm just a person who like to admire beautiful things. Let's put it this way, If I have to... If I have to tell you. I'm Bi. Hey, don't ignore me. As for me, I'm not interested in men. Really? I am sorry about that. Then.. Let me become your first man. I'm not interested in men. Really? I am sorry about that. Then..

You are the one who keep talking non-stop. I just want you to feel that you can't live without me. I can't... I'm too dizzy. Shit. I like you. What? "Bullying" only occurs between lovers, right? Don't tell me you were taking it seriously. Ozaki. I've been interested in you for a long time. I don't want to leave you...that's why I rejected the job offer. Huh? What? Say it one more time.

He is everyone's ideal prince. Were those threat messages? Yeah... I'm happy that you admire me but... I'm not the person who you think I am. Yeah yeah... He got bullied as a child, and far from being a Prince... This is not Tsuburaya. He's not. He's not like this. Ozaki! Who? Ozaki! Who are you? Katsumata! Why are you here? I will be working here starting tomorrow, so I came to say "Hi" But...what's going on? It's no biggie. I'm sorry. I shouldn't say things to ruin your dream. He is actually a kind person. I won't hang out with him anymore. Not hang out with me? I hate people like him. You see... He is a henchman. Because he's a henchman, he needs to be beside me. If not ... I can't be a prince. Okay? Who the hell is he? Well...He's my friend from college. I'm Katsumata. I will be interning starting tomorrow. I will be working under Ozaki's department. Oh...really? And this is... Prince.

I'm sorry. How can I say this... It's fine. I didn't tell you that she's my girlfriend. I'm really...sorry. No matter how many times you apologize, it won't change the fact that you stole someone's girlfriend. I pray for the day that it will no longer hurts. So. That's how is it. Tsuburaya! So? You must have something to say, right? What is it? Are you dating Ozaki-senpai? Why? I heard that you guys are really close. I'm a man, you know? Since long ago, Ozaki-senpai is popular with both genders. Beside...such a beautiful person like you, Ozaki-senpai won't let you go easily. It's a secret. In the past, my old girlfriend got stolen by Ozaki-senpai. Well...Now that I think of it, I don't think it's Ozaki's fault. Until now, I still can't forget that conversation. He's really popular. I'm so envy of Ozaki. Having an admire like you. It's really nothing- No! Even with this painful memories, you still willing to work under his department.... either you really hate him or you really admire him. There's only two explanations. You... Which one are you? What is this? It's like someone looking through me. Which one you think I am? Who knows? Which one... Wa-wait... What- what are you doing? With beauty like yours, of course people will misunderstand. S-stop... That's the worst feeling ever. What's the meaning of this? I also... I like Ozaki-senpai too. Don't take him away from me. This... it's not how it looks like.... huh? I... I like you. Me too.... Senpai. What are you mumbling about? Senpai. Well..I'll leave the orders from the president to you. I'm preparing them now. Ok. Wait! I'm very happy that you and I have the same feeling for each other. Wait! You're being too obvious. Think about what other people will think of us. I'm sorry. You see... I've been meaning to ask you. You...do you want to be top or bottom? I want to be top. But if you... No No No...Doesn't matter. What? Doesn't matter. Understand? Let's treasure ourselves more. Us. We will never see each other naked. Will never... We are not like that. I understand. I'm used to one-sided love. Even if I got hurt, I've always been thinking of you. I never thought of getting an answer from you. As long as I can work by your side, that's enough for me. Katsumata. I don't care if you have a girlfriend or getting marry. I never thought of stealing you away. Unless, Your love walked away. I knew you would be here. Hello there. I'm sorry about yesterday. I acted on my intrusive thoughts In order to help you, Ozaki-senpai lied that he likes me. I finslly understand now. I won't tell anyone about you guys. So don't worry. I'm really sorry. It's okay. Don't worry about it. Oh right... Our department is going on a company field trip. I'm sorry if something happened. Please have fun for me too. Sure. Will completely. Don't fuck with me. Touching my thing? Who the fuck are you? Tsuburaya-san? I don't care what he did in the past. I don't even want to mention it. And the fact that you can't get it over after many years... I don't fuckin' care. I'm joking about the company field trip. It's a joke. I don't care if you're joking or not. What I want to say is... If you ever get close to Ozaki, I will destory you. Do you understand? Yes. With LOUDER voice! YES! Please take good care of my Ozaki. Calm down.. Calm down. You know that it's hard to control it, so why don't I just go ahead first. Wait, you are acting crude since the morning. I got it from you. Wait.. Katsumata is not type of person who will do something like that. I should be on top. I don't know what's wrong with me. If this is just a habit or I'm just being very protective. But. His existent is making me feel uneasy. That's why... I told you Katsumata is not that kind of person. You really trust him a lot. huh? Ozaki, to be honest you used to like him too. right? Sorry. I said things that I shouldn't have said. Just give me more time. What are you talking about? Because I don't know about your past. Me too. I know nothing about your past. But... It's normal. After I met you, It's my first time getting mad, sad and happy because of someone. To be honest, I don't want anyone but you. That's why you know me more than anyone. Ozaki-senpai. Can you take a look at this? Hello there, Katsumata-kun Don't be like that, Tsuburaya-san Pushing away your rival like that! Pardon? Well, I will get going now. What is this? Seems like he gave up. Seriously? Hey! Why are you easily giving up on me? Don't joke around like that. I always think about it. What if Ozaki-san likes someone else? What will I do? What will you do? I won't give up. No, I will continue stay the same. But...You will give up on me, If I like someone else right? Well.... Will I give up? If you are happy with that person, I will give up. So, in conclusion... He has to be you. Right. I also don't want anyone, but you. Either way is fine, right? You're right. These are the twin towers of the major corporation which located in the heart of the city. There are only elicits in this building. They're separated in Team A and Team B. Within each team, there's a leader. Team A's leader, Ozaki Team B's leader, Tsuburaya. This is the love story of how both Ozaki and Tsuburaya met by fate with their heated men pride on the line.
