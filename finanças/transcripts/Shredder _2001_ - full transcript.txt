Jesus Christ! Christ, Cole! You scared the shit out of me! Save your energy for the mountains. Come on. Or we could do it right here. Hey, good call. And mess up all my clothes? Don't you want it to be special, and romantic, and unforgettable? Back in the bathroom then? I'm sorry. I'm just, really anxious for this weekend. A romantic getaway alone, holed up in a secluded mountain chalet, just the two of us. Honey, about that romantic weekend alone? No more rsvps. Well, that's too bad. I think there's room for one more on the luggage rack. Aw, don't you be such a grumble bunny. Relax there, bunny. We just came to shred and no doubt, my cousin dragged us along to cramp your style. Close up. World-champion snowboard god kirk Armstrong and, this chick. Pike. Exterior: U.S. 23. The fateful road. The road to... The highway to destiny. At the wheel, we have Cole Davidson. Cole, you look very, very focused. - Oh shit. Very intense. Hey, are you prepared to face death on the mountain? Your camera's going to make us crash! Dang, stop! Jesus, man! I'm going to chop off your arm, you crazy driver! In the front, we have hot Robyn with hot coffee, and at her side, miss Kimberly Van arx. Beautiful, sexy, rich. - That's right. So tell me, miss Van arx, how does a college co-ed come to be the owner of a private ski resort? Well, you see, it's not exactly private. It's more along the lines of closed. We're just going to go up there and check it out and daddy's company is going to develop 20 jillion vertical feet of virgin powder. Virgin powder. That's what I'm talking about. Robyn could use a blizzard with that shit. Yeah, bite me. Oh, don't listen to her, baby. I respect you. Out of my face, dweeb! Ow, you hit me. Oh! God! Pull over! Live, on tape, the world's sloppiest home videos. When good coffee goes bad. Ha ha! T-shirt. Pull over, please. Okay. Let me out! There's nothing like seeing a beautiful pack of women visiting the watering hole. My god, my god. Hey pike, pike! Yo pike, hey, take this. Document everything. Oh, right. I'm going to film my pee. So you can sell it on the Internet. She wants me. Pubic flosser. What? Dude, she will be mine. Carpet muncher. What, like bi? Pike, dyke. Pike-dyke. Come on, she's not gay. You don't know that. Whatever, she's waiting for the right man. Who? You? The world's oldest living virgin? I'm saving myself. Yeah, for a farm animal. Darn, it's not coming out! You can get a new one. Honey, the sweater's from Paris, not some downtown discount store like ugly clothes for the sheep or hillbillies of California. You are starring in Skyler's next wet dream secrets of the ladies room. Hot girl on girl action. Here it is, Skyler. As close to the real thing as you're ever going to get. Kimberly, do a striptease for Cole. Or are you still making him beg for it? Oh, now why would I stop? It's kind of nice having my own little puppy. You know he won't always be satisfied with just humping your leg. Cole's not really my breed, you know? Maybe I'll just have him fixed. What do you want? This week, Chad. Chad charnley. He's meeting us at the lodge. Ooh, can we share? How much longer to this ancient ski hole anyway? I don't know. On the map, it's about 70 miles up the road or so. Hello. Hi. Uh, skirt, symbol for the ladies room. Where the door is always open. Well, in my country, men and women share the toilet. It's okay. Where are you from? I am from Europe. Christophe. And I am Robyn. You are getting all wet. You can tell? Oh, no way. Oh, shit, forget it. He could be some psycho killer, for Christ's sake. Shit.

She's either a local or a ghost, and either way, she's not begging to blow you. Downhill phantom. Whatever, dude. I saw her, and she was skiing, and I'm not making it up. Hey, how many boards do you need exactly? These are pro samples, dude. If a company can put kirk's name on one of these babies, it, like, doubles the value. Firestone. Weren't those things recalled, bro? Inca, respect. It's not the board that counts, man. It's the rider. Hey, chill out. He's just giving you shit, dude. Kirk is like the master of all this pro crap. Do you know that this man right here took the silver medal at the shasta games? You are god! Hey, wasn't there, like, a urine test for substance abuse? And he's also up for the Olympics, man.

We have a serious flaw in your social planning here. There is an immediate beer run required to ensure the survival of our species! Since you're going, don't you think you might need some, like, food or something? You're a sweetheart. You know, chips or something. Hey, yo Christian, you want to ride to town with us? No, no, you go ahead. I'll stay here, look around. Keep the ladies warm. Weekend alone in the mountains, priceless. 98.74. For everything else, there's my credit card. J I heard the same old bad advice again You fellas ain't heading up to rocky summit, now, are ya? No, sir. Huh? No. Not us. What's rocky summit? According to the legend, it's haunted. Weather changes every five minutes, angry spirits. Okay, then. Well that's good advice. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. I'm telling you fellas for your own good. Listen to me. Stay away from rocky summit. There's folks around here don't want you nowheres near that old place. It's dangerous. Evil. That was her, man. That was the chick that I saw skiing. I want to. Well, that figures, man. Your little mystery-ghost girlfriend works at the nightclub of the living dead. She's an angel, dude, not a ghost. She's cute, all right, I'll give you that. No, she's mega-spankworthy. Spankworthy? You just said spankworthy in my car. You are so not sleeping in my room. Holy shit! What an asshole. Holy shit! Jesus! Here I go. So good! Two in a row. I get to make a new rule. My new rule is no more drinking games. Oh, come on! Truth or drink. Yeah! Truth or dare, okay? No more drinking. It's kind of like that, except for when we don't like your answers you have to drink. No, no, that sounds suspiciously like a drinking game. Okay, okay, I go first, I go first. Are you afraid to go without underwear, cousin? J come on, baby, light my fire » truth, baby, truth, truth! Good morning. Oh, my god. Sexy! This is some quality! Yeah! That's what we like to see. Wear that trophy on your head, son. Prom. Hook it up! Come on, honey! She's raising the stakes. That's my girl. Raising the roof is more like it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! I think it's stuck. Maybe you can help me sky. Tada! That's my girl! Who the hell is that? Charnley. Chad. Tell me what the hell is going on in here. Who the hell are you? I'll ask the questions here. Now you kids understand you know, that I'm going to have to take you all in, don't you? You're trespassing. How can we trespass on our own property? I'm Kimberly Van arx, as in Van arx construction. That's great. I'm the sheriff, as in you have a right to remain silent. Hello, sheriff. Why don't you just come right in to our party and let us warm you up? Look, you can't stay here, no. This whole place is condemned. Ooh, toney. Is that as in tiger? Hi, like I said, my daddy's buying the place. It's really sweet of you to take care of us. You're so nice. And so handsome. Yeah, it's really not safe up here, what with the murders and all. The murders. Let me get some I.D. Oh, lordy. No, look, look, you can't stay here, no matter who you are. I gotta run you all in. I gotta run you out. I gotta... This wind, it just chills me to the bone. Maybe you got some ID, too? Officer, here's my I.D. Yeah, okay. But you better be gone first thing in the morning. You're a very compassionate man, officer. Yeah, I don't, I don't want to see you kids up on that hill with your goddamn snowboards. No one wants you up here. - Oh yes. It's very dangerous out here, and that's a fact. I just don't want to see anything happen to you, you pretty ladies. You know, we never caught the killer so you got to get out. God, he grabbed my ass! What the hell did you get us into? Wait, this place is scary, but it's not deadly, right? Oh, well, actually, it sort of is. So why did this place close down? Okay, like, 100 years ago when snowboarding was new, they tried to ban it up here. You know, attracts the wrong element, not safe, but of course, people were riding anyway. And then there was this egregious accident. Wait, I believe officer easy-bribe used the word murder. Okay, there was this little girl. She was kind of, like, skiing by herself... And these three boarders, totally faded, like, 10 point a million blood alcohol level. No, please! Leave me alone! Bono. Skied a tree. You mean she died? 1 guess so, duh. So what happened to the assholes that killed her? That's the weird thing. They had these, like, perpetrators, you know, but when the cops went to arrest them they had just vanished. Wait, so how did uncle warbucks end up buying the place? I guess daddy heard about the tragedy up here and the ski resort couldn't get insurance or whatever after the little girl died, so our lawyers are working with the bankruptcy court. So we're checking out an investment? I mean you tricked us into breaking into an abandoned ski resort, the site of unsolved murders, killers on the loose? Wait, we're shredding on the grim reaper discount plan. Bad Karma. Word. You and your old man are gonna incur some serious Karma deficit. Totally. And they say the ghost of the little girl still wanders the slopes, seeking revenge. And when the wind picks up, you can hear her crying for her long lost family. Jesus! The window! Ooh, scary. There was someone there, seriously. Was it a killer ghost of a little girl? No, more like... Chad. Chad. Hello, is anyone there? Hey, come on, Skyler, let's go take a look. Uh uh. Kirk? Jacques cousteau? Ah, come on. You're all a bunch of pussies. Pussy! Boo. Holy shit! Oh, Jesus Christ. Murderer part's making you jumpy? You're cruel, pike. Hey, check it out, electricity. No no, no goddamn way am I going down there. Right, killer ghost of an eight-year-old. I'm sorry, you've got more balls than any of us do. What is that supposed to mean? Hey, relax. I was just kidding. It's always like you guys to take everything the wrong way. Us guys? Which guys? Hey, you know, I mean, it's cool, baby. Your lifestyle is none of my business. My lifestyle? It's okay. I know, I understand. I'm with it. I like chicks, too. Did Kimberly tell you that I'm gay? Well, you know. Pike, dyke. And Cole rhymes with asshole. Intrusive bitch. Ah, shit. Ooh, the modern miracle of electricity. Don't go into the light! Nuh uh. Awesome! I bet this whole mountain has power. Awesome! - Alright! Tomorrow we ride in style. Leave me alone! Help me please!

So let me know if you find out. Morning. Oh, hey. Where were you last night? Did you miss me? You're a sight to behold. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Morning. It's time. Morning. Let's ride. Don't you think we should wait for Chad or something? He could be lost. No. Or maybe we should report him missing. And get arrested for trespassing? No, screw him, man. He's a survivor. Regardless, if he's frozen solid somewhere it's time to board. Powder. It's time to shred! Powder! Besides, there could be a whole mountain of freshies up there, cuz. You know it! It's boarding time and we are gonna shred until we're dead! Come on, sexy! If Chad was dead, you would totally be on top. You would be the fucking endorsement king. You would have so much cheddar. You should've killed him a long time ago. Oh, sick. No, dude, even if we were supposed to be here, we weren't allowed to do that. Disgusting. Dag, that's like trespassing while you're trespassing. Tight. Dude, no! How are you gonna clean up on Chad's sponsors if you're killed by the drop? Later. Yo! Man! Hey, I hope you know your way back!

Okay, here's my problem with snowboarding. Snowboarding has completely ruined the fashion of skiing. Exhibit a, your giant ass. Now gaze upon the work of art that is my derriere. Alright, woo hoo! Well, I could teach you to ride. Come on. Hey, label baby, your artwork ass is gonna enter its blue period. Its black and blue period. I was just kidding. Seriously, I'll teach you how to rip. I thought you weren't supposed to teach a girl how to ride. That's drive, you're not supposed to teach a girl how to drive. Single. Look, seriously, I'll teach you. It's cool, it's no big deal. But christophe has technique that you can't compete with. Well, we shouldn't separate, okay? What if you get hurt or something? You know what? Maybe I'll call you sometime. Leave me alone! Help me please! Yo! Whoa! Whoa, dude! Oh, gouge. You, Karma, bad. J somebody kill me j j somebody kill me j» holy shit! Cole! Oh, shit! Cole! Oh my god, Cole! Cole! Are you all right? A dead snowboarder! I could tell you were gonna go for a little mouth-to-mouth there, weren't you? Get out! I didn't even touch you. Somebody was dicking with my bindings. A poor workman blames his tools. Blow me, okay? I was going to, but you woke up. Oh, damn! Come on, help me. Get up. We're gonna have to share a board. Come on. Whoa! I totally didn't see you coming. I didn't know anyone else was up here. Hello, hot babe talking to you. Are you deaf or just rude? My girlfriend owns this place, Mr. Friendly guy. And we only share with people who don't totally suck. Get used to it. You know, you don't have to like us, but boarders are the future. Whatever. We make our own rules, dude, and you better get used to it. Those are skiers rules, asshole! What is your damage, dickweed? You could've killed me! I don't ski, I shred. Oh, beautiful baby. Look at the snow bunny. Hey, hottie! Over here! I'm right here! Ow! You surprised me. How come I'm the one injured? Well I'm usually up here alone, but thanks for fixing my chair lifts. I saw you skiing yesterday. And at the bar last night. You're one of those snowboarder guys, right? Yeah, yeah. Just boarder or shredder. Shredder's good. Sounds dangerous. Danger is my middle name, baby. Skyler. Skyler's my name. Oh, hi, I'm Shelly. - Hi. Whoa! Maybe you're the one who's dangerous. You don't even know, Skyler danger. I could teach you to ride. To do the snowboard. No. Oh, sorry. Well, no, it's just, I tried it once, but it's not for me. Hey! Oh, shit! Wait! Stop the lift! Somebody help! Curses. The snowboarding superhero and his fair maiden are foiled again. Wait, let me be your knight in shining armor. All clear up top? Not really! All clear bottom? Dude, you are so killer. You live up here long enough, you learn some job skills. Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Oh god. Whoa, whoa! No! And I'm telling you, he's only, like, the best snowboarder in the entire world. That's what I'm doing my documentary on. So, how come you chose our little mountain to do your movie? Well, it's not really like that. See, my friend's, like, buying the place and she wanted us to come and, you know, check it out. Well, actually, she wanted kirk to come and check it out. You know, I'm just along for the chowder. My dad hates snowboarders. He says you're all irresponsible. Well, I'm not really a snowboarder. I'm a filmmaker. Snowboarding's just my hobby. Wouldn't you rather ski? So where do you... Are you... Where do you live? Go ahead, go first. No, it's okay. We are staying at the old lodge. Jeez. You can't stay there. Well, it's cold, and it's pretty creepy but, hey, the price is right. No, I mean, well, I used to work there, before my mom died. Oh. I'm sorry. Damn. Wow. I like the cold when it gets hot. It's kind of like going from the hot tub to the snow. Right. Yeah. No, I totally understand. Sometimes I wear boxers, you know? Keep in the chill. Yeah. Your hand, it's so warm. Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, my god! Uh, keep your, keep your tits. Uh, shit. Keep your tips up, prepare to unload. Hey, get your ass over here! Shelly. God, dad, are you following me? Don't get smart with me, young lady. You know better than to get mixed up with this. You are a control freak. I can take care of myself. No, you get your ass back home now! I warned you kids to stay away from here. My friends are buying the place. Nobody's bought nothing! You get your friends off this mountain or you'll have hell to pay. And you stay away from that girl. Hey, man, but... Whatever, dude. Deborah to Kimberly, can you hear me? Kimberly, can you hear me? Bitch. Kimberly. God damn it, you made me fall over. We're having lunch. Where are you? I'm in the snow on the damn ground. It's cold up here. Come and get me. Hey, are Robyn and christophe with you? No, they ditched me. Sit tight, okay? We'll come find you. Where the hell have you been? Kimberly. Never mind, someone's here to rescue me. Well, what about your lunch? Eat it. I have a surprise for you, my angel. Okay, we'll catch up with you later then? Hey, Cole! Cole, dude, yo, wait up! Hey hey. I totally saw her! Who? Shelly, man. The bartender chick. I talked to her, man. We hanged. Well, we hung. Shut up. No, dude, I'm serious! She's totally into me! Whatever, I'm serious. Wait, she skis nude. Aw, what, did you smoke, your entire stash in one day? No, no, he saw her, too, man. But not, like, nude or skiing. That old dude was there, too, but, he was... That's a totally whacked snowman. Oh, my god. Whoa! Your sense of humor is perverse, Skyler. Too bad it's totally fake-looking. Holy shit! What in the hell did you do that for?! Jesus Christ! That sick bastard. Who? That goddamn, that euro-trash piece of shit. We gotta find Kimberly. Kimberly! Kimberly do you copy? Kimberly! Is anyone here?! Oh, man. He called her his little snow angel or some shit like that. I mean, if he could kill the sheriff, who the hell knows what he'll do to Kimberly. Wait, you think that christophe did that? I never trusted that guy. No, come on, Cole, he was right here all night. Oh, was he? I mean, you saw the way he looked when Skyler filmed him. Oh, come on, guys, we can't jump to conclusions. We don't know who killed frosty the sheriff man. It could have been Chad. No one's even seen him. Chad's not here. Listen, you saw the way he acted when the sheriff came in. He's freaked out. He's totally split. So, he's got a problem with authority. Why are you defending him so much? I'm not defending him! But just because some jerk-off exotic foreigner's a threat to your shitty relationship with that manipulative bitch of a girlfriend does not mean he's a killer! Listen to me. Your cousin is fighting for her life out there and who the hell knows what he did to Robyn and kirk. He's right. We should go form a search party of our own. Hey. Whatever. Such exquisite beauty I have not seen since Florence and Raphael's Venus. Stop it, christophe. But I cannot help myself. Venus, the goddess whose very name represents beauty is nothing compared to your loveliness. No, I mean it. Can the little act. It's getting old. It's time for us to play our own little game of truth or dare. Whose dump is this? I can explain... You didn't meet up with us by accident, did you? Did you? - No. I saw you at the gas station. I heard you talking, and I just thought that you... No, no, no, no. You know this place too well, and you were hiding from the sheriff. Yes. What are you, what are you doing? No, give me that back! "Chris ramos, 217 central Avenue, Fresno?" Fresno? This, this is my friend's parents' place. Before the accident, we used to come up here every year. You are quite the bad boy. You had me fooled until you pulled out the high school French. No, you don't understand. I needed to get in the lodge, all right? Since I've known you, you've done nothing but pose, front, and lie. I kind of like that. Come on! These tracks totally go through here! Rip it up! No way, dude! Oh, man. Pike! Kimberly! Pike! Kimberly! Pike! There's more to it. Really? I'm a killer. But the whole thing was an accident, and not like in your story. You know, about the little girl, the ghosts, all that. I think my friends were murdered. And what's this, your knife? What happened to that little girl was wrong, but we didn't kill her. Then who did? It was all one big accident. I mean, I think my friends were killed for it. You know that girl Shelly, that's hanging out with your friend? Well, I guess you could say we dated and she was a little young and, anyway, it was her little sister. The whole point is, her dad hates snowboarders and I think he did something to my friends. In order to prove it, I had to get in the lodge. So you're like Mr. detective guy? Fugitive is much sexier. Yo, kirk! Dude, you in there?! Kirk! Kirk? Kirk? Cool. Well, he's not in here, so, come on, let's go. Come on. Pike, girl, it's freezing in here. Wait. I'm out, no, I'm out. I'm out. Check out all this junk. These things are everywhere. "Drunk driving teens kill wife of resort owner." Hello? Kirk? Damn. This place is nuts. "Snow-surfing." Whoa. Hey, get a shot of this doll and junk. "Rocky summit closes early." Dude, come get a shot of this. Whoa, this thing's totally real. Creepy. I don't think that's a doll. Whoa! - Oh, my god! She's like preserved! No shit! Frozen. Jesus, this dude is sick. If the dude that killed this little girl also killed the sheriff, that makes him, like, a serial killer. Cool. No, no, I mean, from a documentary... Whatever. Yeah, until he kills you. Wait, what if this is the little girl that was... No, this is crazy. Shit! Get him off me! Oh, my god, get up, get up! Go, go, go! Come on! My camera! Hey! Back off! Yeah! Cole! What the hell are you doing? I swear to god, it's not what it looks like. I can't believe this. I risked my life to save yours. I thought you were in danger. I was trying to go slow and not pressure you. I didn't realize you were saving yourself for... I mean, he's a killer! I mean, do you realize that you're banging some murderer?! No, I know. He told me it was an accident. Accident? What the hell are you talking about? He killed your friend, and he murdered the sheriff in cold blood. The little girl wasn't my friend. Jesus! God damn it, Cole! God damn it, Cole! Cole, Kimberly, over here! What happened?! We just had a rendezvous with the killer. No, no, no, no. She's been keeping him busy. Stop calling him that! We just saw him! We found kirk's body. Oh, shit! What do you mean kirk's body? Yeah, and then the mo'fo attacked me. Hey, your goddamn lover is a killer, okay. He stabbed the sheriff, and he got Robyn, too. She's strung up on the lift. He told me it was an accident! No, no, no. He's a cold-blooded killer. Wait, I'm telling you, if christophe was with her there's no way it was him. I was face-to-face with the killer 10 minutes ago. Christophe is not a killer! The little girl was killed in an accident! Wait, wait, what little girl?! The fossil. Freaky, frozen dead girl. What about Robyn?! She's been dead for a while now. Aren't you cold? No, no, no baby. You gotta let me get some rest. I'm tellin' ya, you're gonna kill me if you make me go another time. Oh, no. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't say anything, okay? Don't do this. Don't don't do this. Oh, god! No! No! Okay, it's not him. Let's get outta here. Call the sheriff! The sheriff's dead. Jesus Christ. Shit! Shit! We're screwed. Damn it! The sheriff, Robyn, kirk, probably Chad. Careful. Oh, my god, that's it. We're irresponsible. We're negligent skiers. What? That's why he keeps killing us. We broke the rules. Look. "Observe all posted signs and warnings. Help me. "Keep off closed trails and out of closed areas." That's kirk. "State law prohibits riding lift or skiing "while under the influence of alcohol or drugs." I didn't break any of those rules. And that's why you're not dead. Come on, knock it off, all right?! He's not killing us because of these stupid skier rules. Hey, reality check! Nobody would kill over this, okay! Because if he was, we'd all be dead already! Just give it time. Look, haul bleeder upstairs right now. We've gotta get outta here, okay? Owl! Kimberly, find some weapons or something. = no! No! Ow! Normally, I'd charge you extra for multiple piercings. I have a coupon! Hold that closed. Sorry. Jesus Christ! A gift from Robyn. Maybe she'll have to wear something else to the debutante funeral. Ouch! Stop! We have to get out of here! Wait, not tonight, okay. He's down for the count, and we don't have a car. There was a radio and a telephone in the basement, but they're dead along with christophe's friends. What, snowboarders? Not anymore! How did they get down there? I don't know! I didn't ask them, they've been dead for a while! They could have been down there a long time like that girl. Freaky, frozen icicle chick. But you know what, for future reference, Kimmy, the next time we're being stalked by a serial killer, do not go into the basement! How's it going, tool master? Not good. Look, go back inside, okay, it's not safe. Pretty weird in there, too. Cole. Just in case we don't get another chance. There, I just wanted to get that out of the way. Good call. We could just run around the lodge in our underwear until we die. That's not a bad way to go. No. Yes! I'll be right back. I guess I should have taken shop. You know you can't kill me 'cause I'm still a virgin. Skyler? Skyler Whoa, hold it! I'm sorry, Chad. Okay, try it again. Shit. Cole, Cole. Cole! Cole, can you hear me? Cole. Cole. Kimberly?

And I shouldn't even be using this equipment unsupervised! Look! Check it out! No safety strap! I have no device to prevent runaway equipment! And I'm littering! I never take responsibility for people ahead of me on the trail! Where the hell are you?! Come and get me! I hate skiers! Oops. Shit. Shit! Shit! Shit! Holy shit! God damn it! Okay, okay, extreme sports. Life or death. Freeze! Stand up! I'll fucking shoot you! Get off my mountain! Who are you? Why can't you leave us alone? Leave you alone? Are you crazy? You killed my friends! I didn't kill anybody! Who are you? Lose the mask, you bastard! You? What the hell? You goddamn snowboarders killed my wife and my little daughter. A dozen simple rules, and you irresponsible punks can't follow one of them! Freeze! I'll shoot youl! Look, son. I was just trying to scare you all. Get you off my mountain.
