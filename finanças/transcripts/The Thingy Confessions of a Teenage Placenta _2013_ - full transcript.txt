[music playing] NARRATOR: In the beginning, as was said of old, the earth was without form and void. Rivers and seas appeared on the face of the earth, and presently the waters teemed with living things. And in due time, creatures, more or less independent of the water, producing eggs with shells. Finally, there evolved what scientists call the intra-uterine form of gestation, most highly developed in the mammals. In this class of animals, the development of the egg takes place solely in the dark confines of the mother's womb. It is this mysterious prologue to life that we shall attempt to portray in this film. The story of the adventures of the mammalian egg. Out of which has come all the higher animals, including mankind. All the armies that have marched the earth, and drenched its soil with their blood. [GRUNTING Come on, Reggy. Hey, it's just a little prick. You know it doesn't hurt. [Speaking Italian] You have had dozens of this! I know, Doc, but it-- it just gives me the chills -to see it every time. -Oh Reggy! You're never going to be a big boy if you're if you’re going to be afraid to watch it. Don't look away. Come on. It's just-- -It's just-- -DOCTOR FORD: That’s it! Watch it! Watch it, damn it! MAN: Doctor Ford, Marianne-- Marianne is giving birth. Oh, no. Not now. [Speaking Italian] Suzy, get my tools! What now? What now? She was training her pelvic muscles on the big machine in the back. And then the contractions begun. [Speaking Italian] -DOCTOR FORD:[Speaking Italian] -[Panting and moaning] [Grunting and panting] Oh! Aqua! Can, uh, some-- someone bring me towels? What's your best, Marianna? Everything is looking fine. Ahh! Push it, Marianne. Push it! Concentrate! Oh! Oh! -Here, Marianna. These might help. Take deep breaths. In and out. Push! Push, Marianne! Push! [Speaking Italian] Push it! Push! I see its head! I see its head! Ah! Here we are. [BABY CRYING] Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful little baby boy. Oh, yes. Ma'am, we're going to have to ask you to sign this form. We need your permission to donate your placenta to the medical industry, so that it can be processed into drugs and cosmetics. No. Just put it in a bag. I'm going to eat it. Family tradition. [Speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] Suzy, we need alcohol. Oh, you're beautiful, baby boy. Come on, baby boy, drink it. Drink it. You have to be strong. Reggy, could you hold this for a minute for me? Yeah, no bother. Oh, my Lord. Jesus Christ! MARIANNE: Come on, drink, son. Drink it. Drink it. -You have to drink, son. -[CORK POPS] [MEN LAUGHING] [CHEERING] You have to drink it. Drink it. MARIANNE: Yes. Yes. [BELL RINGS] Father? That's a long time ago. So? Father, I'm here because... it’s-it's not that... it needs to be baptized, Father Gritty What? My son. And is it? Is he... in there? Yes. Oh, what a wonderful life that awaits this child. Can you do it, please? Yes, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Let's have a look at the little fellow. You know, Madam, that the good shepherd, our Lord, doesn't appreciate the black sheep in his flock. However... I for one have never been afraid to make my hands dirty. Let's just prepare him a little bath. I have never... in my entire career... put an unclean baby in the baptismal fountain. What will be the child's name? Luke. Does Luke have a godfather? Would-- would you like to be his godfather? We cannot baptize him without... so I guess, I would be honored. I hope as his godfather I will see little Luke quite often in my church. I promise if you die I will take good care of him. Thank you, Father. No, no, no, no. It is my duty. [PURRING No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look. My first present, for my first godchild. Thank you. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the [inaudible]. Birth is like a little wonder. Every child is a gift of God. Only God can provide that special gift of life to us, which carries the hope in the future of all mankind. In nomine Patris in Spiritus et Spiritus Sancti.

We will never be able to join competition like this. Well, I'm not ready for competition yet. That matter with that pregnancy... with my husband, and I have to take care for Luke, right? [SLAMMING WEIGHTS] -What? -But- it's been five years. Since Reggie died... I need-- I need a new student. Someone I can teach all my knowledge. Like I said, first I have to find a decent school for Luke. And then we'll see. [OMINOUS BUZZING] [BREATHING] [OMINOUS BUZZING] [OMINOUS BUZZING CONTINUES] Get off me. Come on, give us some!

Mom! Ah! Ah! [LUKE WHIMPERING] Laika! [LAIKA WHINING] LUKE: Can you tell another bedtime story about daddy? MARIANNE: Your daddy is the best driver in 'nam. And once, he drove the whole battalion through the jungle. He saved them all from the claws of Charlie-- men without legs, men without arms men without their testicles. No, that wasn't enough. He even brought his dead comrades back to their families, so that they could be buried the Christian way. LUKE: The Christian way. One day, he will be back from his mission, I promise. Can I have a race car too, mom? MARIANNE: Well, I'm going to ask Santa Claus. Hmm? [KISS] Good night, you little soldier. [LUKE VOCALIZING] Here, your grenade. Bye bye! [LUKE SNORING SOFTLY] [WIND HOWLING] [LUKE VOCALIZING] [UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [LUKE VOCALIZING] MAN (ON TV): The processes here described are the same for all mammals, even man. For each baby rabbit, there must have been a separate egg. But before the egg can develop, it must be fertilized. And this is the important contribution of the male of the species. The spermatozoa act here like very active squirming fellows. Notice the large head, the lashing, whip-like tails, and the streamlined effect in general. LUKE: Hmm. [MAN CONTINUES ON TV] FRANCIS: I heard, Mr. David, he always carries that gun, and that once he shot a kid in a classroom because she failed a physics test. My parents would sue his ass if he ever shot me with a gun. Pfft, what a loser. My parents would try to get as much money as possible out of his ass. Your father can't even afford a lawyer. Spit your silver. But silence is golden, you little prick. [LUKE VOCALIZING] Don't tell my little brother to shut up. He's right, you know? Please keep it silent during the movie! [LUKE VOCALIZING] [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] MR. DAVID: Sit down, class. Let's at least keep watching until fertilization has taken place. [SMALL CAR WHIRRING LOUDLY] LUKE: Um-- oh, whoa. Whoa! Uh-- Don't die under me now. [engine turns over] MICHAEL THE BULLY: Come on, move it you freak! It's not his fault. Why don't you take on someone of your own size? I heard he still sucks his mother's tits. [BLEEP] Oh, let's just move over him. [ENGINE TURNING OVER REPEATEDLY] I hunted you. [TV PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] And I shot you, and I- I stuffed you. Only because I love you. (CHANGING PITCH) I love you too, David. [SMALL CAR WHIRRING] LUKE: I hate you, car. Always embarrassing me. I'm the worst driver in the land. [SMALL CAR WHIRRING, APPROACHING] [KICKS CAR, ENGINE STOPS ABRUPTLY] MICHAEL THE BULLY: What, you fucking meat, you following me or something? LUKE: No, I was just-- [struggle] Ah! Ah! [LUKE GROANING] You have picked the wrong guy to mess with, Luke. Please, I didn't mean to follow you. I live here, on the fifth floor. Fifth, huh? OK. Prove it. What are the names of the two bums who live down the hallway? Um-- the tall one is Harry. And I don't know what his friend is called. Please don't hurt me. I don't know either. I suppose it doesn't have a name. I guess you're legit, kid. [LUKE VOCALIZING] [SQUELCH] LUKE: Your name is Francis, right? You're in my class. But I didn't know you lived in this neighborhood too. FRANCIS: Sure. See you around, or whatever. [luke vocalizing] FRANCIS: Maybe you should sell it, baby. It could be a crazy adventure. Maybe not. [WHISTLE BLOWS] MICHAEL THE BULLY: Oh!

LUKE: I didn't do anything, Michael. You know what we're talking about. LUKE: What-- My little brother saw you today, at the gym. [LUKE VOCALIZING] Trying to get some ass for yourself, aren't you? Hitting on one of my girls, aren't you? LUKE: Ah! MICHAEL THE BULLY: What are planning to do, Georgie Boy? Gonna make a move on her? You gonna ask her out? Watch one of your geeky science-fiction movies with her? [LUKE BREATHING HEAVILY] Is that what you're planning to do? Is that what you're planning to do? And then what? You're gonna take her home to your room? You're going to penetrate her with this umbilical cord of yours? Pump her full of enzymes, vitamins? Some amino acids? Is that what you're after? Sodomizing her to nourish her? That's what your kind is known to do, right? Nourishing? [SQUISHING, PUNCHING] [LUKE GRUNTING] Now give me your lunch money. LUKE: (WEAKLY) I don't have money. I always bring lunch from home. I'll just take your lunch. [LUKE GRUNTING] [LUKE WHIMPERING] Oh, ham! I love ham! [LUKE WHIMPERING] Thanks for the meat, freak.

Luke, that's a long time ago. Are you here for your uncle, or for God, the Almighty? Both. What's the matter? A lot. Not a lot of people come here for advice anymore these days. You can tell me. What's the matter, my little friend? Yesterday in school, there was a girl. Ah, the sin of flesh. I knew the day would come. How old are you now, 13? That's not too early. Tell me about it. I mean, tell me about her. LUKE: Her name is Rihanna. And she's most beautiful girl in school. Mhm, tell me about her legs. She would never go out with me. She dated Michael for a long time. Tell me about her legs. Michael's the best-looking guy and the biggest bully in school. But teachers let him beat me up, because he's the best baseball team leader the school's ever seen. Luke, whatever happens, you have to tell me all the delicate details, so that God can forgive you. Did you spoke your mum about it? Haven't seen her for a while. Yeah, but she wasn't listening. She's just busy training her arm. Competition year, competition year. You think she'd go out with me? I mean, it's over between Michael and her. Don't tease me. You would like to tell me. Stop it, please. [FATHER LAUGHS] [WET NOISES] LUKE: Please. Stop. [grunting] FRANCIS: You're perfectly built to rip off these fucking machines. I taught that same trick to my sister. She had these very skinny arms for awhile. Lots of people called it a disorder, but whatever. She had to get some more meat on her bones, anyway. Because they wouldn't let her join the army otherwise. My dad's still in the war, too. War's fun, you know? She always writes about how they get wasted on this real local booze. She's going to bring me some when she gets back. If you don't have anything to talk about, might as well catch the afternoon movie. LUKE: Uh-- I don't know, Francis. Maybe I should go home. Mom always hits Laika when I'm late. Do whatever you need to do, man. MAN ON FILM: Alright, let her go LUKE: No, wait for me. [sci-fi movie playing] MAN 1 (IN MOVIE): What is it? MAN 2 (IN MOVIE): I wonder if it is a form of life. I'll investigate at once. MAN 1 (IN MOVIE): All right, Chen Yu. And while you're doing that, let's go and try to follow that line. MAN 3 (IN MOVIE): OK. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] MAN 2: On again. Come on. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Be right back, I guess. LUKE: Hmm? [MOVIE PLAYING] [GIRL GIGGLING] [GIRL CLEARS THROAT] [MOVIE PLAYING] [LUKE VOCALIZING] [MOVIE PLAYING Look, I'm going to get some snacks. -Wait for me here. -Oh, uh- you want me to help you steal stuff from the machine, like you showed me? No. We'll be fine. See you in a minute. Uh-huh. Oh. [MOVIE PLAYING] [LUKE VOCALIZING] Hmm, Mhm, mhm. Of course. Oh, so that's how they do it. Ah. MARIANNE: Luke! Supper's ready! I'm studying, mom. Well get your ass over here! I'm already lactating! OK. MARIANNE: Hmm, yesterday-- yesterday, Luke told me he's too scared to ask a girl out. Scared. But what's the matter with that boy? I-- I mean, you never have been scared of something. Where did he get that kind of foolish behavior? Well, not from me. I tried to give him everything he needs. Maybe you gave him too much. You should really stop breastfeeding him. [CLOCK TICKING] Oh, I don't like this. [EXHALES] That's what, uh, Reggy always used to say. Oh, I love this. Oh, Ford, your flu shots are still the best. De la casa. MARIANNE: (WHISPERING) Yes. It's on the house. Mhm? Thanks. DR. FORD: Just make we win the next contest. [SPANISH] We still have six weeks. Six. DR. FORD: And then there is another thing-- something else you do. MARIANNE: Oh, what? You still have that baby, do you? Oh. I see. Well... everything for my own, Ford, everything. [BEEPING] [BEEPING] [POURING GASOLINE] ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: But what if Mr. David's going to see us? No worries. He's probably fucking one of his birds right now. Can't you just let it go? You have me now, huh? She doesn't matter anymore. A man's got to defend his honor. One day, I'll do the same thing for you. Hey! Leave some for the fuse! OTIS THE LITTLE BULLY: Can I light it? MICHAEL THE BULLY: You can't even light a cigarette! [GAS IGNITES] [FLAMES CRACKLING] [EXHALES] [DOOR OPENS] LUKE: Hey, guys. Car broke down. LUKE: Burnt to pieces. Here, kiddo. Have a drink with us. You look like you need it. LUKE: Uh, no-- uh-- [pouring booze] [luke chokes, coughs] [laughter] BOTH: He can take it! LUKE: I better get inside now. Before your mother sees you with us, right? HARRY THE STREET BUM: Will you give the kid a break, Bill? LUKE: So your name's Bill? [PEOPLE SPEAK ON TV] Dirty scumbags. LUKE: Um-- mom? Oh, Luke, something arrived for you today. But you better watch out with it. I think those dirty bums from down the hall have tampered with it. They've been through our mail. Here, smell it. [LUKE SNIFFS] LUKE: I only smell Laika. MARIANNE: Oh no, definitely the smell of sticky fingers and cheap liquor. Terrorists. All three of them. LUKE: Three? MARIANNE: Oh yeah, today there was a smaller one with them, a young punk with a dragon T-shirt. How tasteless can you be? LUKE: Oh. [NATURE DOCUMENTARY PLAYING ON TELEVISION ABOUT PREYING MANTIS MATING HABITS] LUKE: Please. mom, you don't need that stuff anymore. It killed Reggy. MARIANNE: He had bigorexia, Luke. When he looked in the mirror, he saw the skinny Reggy. He wouldn't allow the muscles in his own life. And look how he ended up. Hmm? [SIGHS] MARIANNE: You hungry, Luke? I have good news. I've decided to join competition again. Good for you, mom. So... How is your little girlfriend? So you did listen. MARIANNE: Of course I've listened. You're my son. LUKE: I called her. And I asked her out. You really did? LUKE: Yes, mom, like a soldier. MARIANNE: Ah. [LUKE GROWLS] Please, mom, I'm not a little baby anymore. So when is your little date? LUKE: In two weeks, Thursday. Ah... then I have my competition. I wish you could be there, to see your mom behave like a real man It's going to be our lucky day then, I guess. You little charmer. Your father would be so proud of you if he could be here. Hmm? [GRUNT, THUD] Hmm? LUKE: Thanks, mom. I knew smoking can be addictive. I didn't have that one yet. Come. Yes. Yes. Good dog, huh? [SIGHS] MARIANNE: That's good. [SHOWER RUNNING] [WEIGHTS SHAKING, HEAVY BREATHING] LUKE: (WITH DEEP VOICE) Hey, baby. [CLEARS THROAT] (WITH DEEP VOICE) Hey, baby. Check out my car.

Rihanna, that's a biblical name, right? Yeah. LUKE: Excuse me, waiter? Yes? LUKE: This napkin also has greasy stains on it. WAITER: Yes. I also forgot how the lady would like to have her meat? I like my meat bloody. WAITER: Right. So... I heard from Michael that you own a car. LUKE: Oh, yeah. I have a white Audi sports car with lots of corporate publicity stickers on it. I have publicity for a gas company and for the telephone company. Ooh, and I have publicity for the Monte Carlo Rally Company. Sounds like a nice car. Yeah. I can't drive it for a while now though. Michael got jealous and he set it on fire. I guess all is fair in love and war. Yeah. LUKE: I'm here with you now. Can I have one? Feel free. There you go. [COUGHING] [LAUGHTER] LUKE: I'm sorry. [LUAGHTER] It's all right. It's not your fault. [LAUGHTER] [COUGHING [COUGHING] Hey, mate, what do you think? Nice fish for your nice lady? LUKE: I don't know-- I have a very good one, how about this one? LUKE: Sure, I guess-- MERCHANT: This one? LUKE: Keep the change. OK, thanks. And I would say, uh-- enjoy the rest of the evening, love birds. So-- what are you going to name it? It may be dead, but it still deserves a name. Actually, I need to pee. OK. RIHANNA: Actually, this is quite embarrassing. Could you come with me to the lavatory? Oh. [LUKE VOCALIZING] What do you think you're doing? You're not coming in here with me!

Just sip a sip of our bottle. You look like you could need it. Have you guys seen Francis around lately? Haven't seen him for weeks now. Me either. Damn shame too.

That's how I got what I wanted, with half the effort. It's usual you just get the half... of what you want. But it is just half as good as you thought it would be before getting it. So I thought, I'll just go for one. Then I wouldn't be disappointed afterwards. Excuse me, I never did a woman before. -So I-- -MARIANNE: It's not for me Do I look like someone who would go to the hookers? Pumping iron... blood rushing through my veins, that makes me cum. I cum 100 times a day. I cum in the gym. I cum at home. I even cum while ironing your panties. I don't need a ride on the dirt bike. ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: I prefer not to be called that way. Oh. Yes. I'm sorry. It's for my son. $50, paid in advance. MARIANNE: Oh? Don't you want to meet him first? He's your son. It's his first time, I guess. Fine. If you say so. Wait here. I told you to wait over there. Watch out for our dog. He can be a bit ratty sometimes. Back off, Laika! Just follow the slime track. And... don't forget to close the door, will ya? [SIGHS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [DOOR CREAKS] LUKE: Mama delivered me herself, took me from between her legs. Bloody little mess. They were just about to feed me to the chickens. Daddy said, maybe we could use a boy, Marianne. ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: Jesus. [LUKE VOCALIZING] [WET NOISES] LUKE: Mama told me such horrible things. All that killing, and all that blood, she loves him for that, worships him. But who am I kidding? He's just a dead loser. But still... I would so much like to meet him once. I know the feeling. LUKE: Why? Did your mama tell you horrible things about your dad too? I never met him either. LUKE: That's a pity. You're a pretty girl. ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: So? What do you want me to do? You don't have a little race car, do you? Hmm? LUKE: It's just a joke. Do you want to sit down? [CLOSES DOOR] [FLY BUZZING] ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: Mind if I smoke? LUKE: Can I have the warning print of the package? [FLICKS LIGHTER] ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: What? LUKE: Um, I collect these prints. On your package it's a picture of a pregnant woman. I never saw that one before. Oh. You want the picture. I guess you can have it. The package is nearly empty. So-- LUKE: Can you cut it out for me? There are scissors on the table. [LUKE MOANING] So... What do I do with it next? LUKE: There's a book on the table that has some empty pages. I would be real nice if you could glue it in. [LUKE VOCALIZING] [LUKE GRUNTING] LUKE: Thanks. Mmmm... Is it OK on that page? LUKE: Thanks. Do you want to see the rest of the pictures? Wait. I still have to glue it. You shouldn't listen to that girl. And you shouldn't listen to your mother either. You don't know what your father really wanted. If you don't want to be a soldier, then don't. I do what my mother always did, and my life's a living nightmare. LUKE: I'm sorry. [THUNDER RUMBLING, RAIN HITTING WINDOW] Have you ever been with a girl? LUKE: Hmm-- [LUKE MOANING] [THUNDER RUMBLING, RAIN HITTING WINDOW] [LUKE MOANING] [THUNDER AND RAIN GROW LOUDER] Do you like my breasts? LUKE: Uh-- you're sweet. Don't be shy, you little ham, OK? LUKE: Would you Like to touch my umbilical cord? Do I have to be gentle with it? LUKE: No, nothing special about it. [LUKE MOANING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS FAINTLY] ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: I wanted to leave. But his umbilical cord wouldn't let go of my hand. I wonder how long he had been clinging to you. MARIANNE: I didn't ask you to stay all night. ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: Like I say, he wouldn't let go! MARIANNE: Bullocks! You just have had a sleep instead of doing your job, you lazy piece of shit! And I already paid you $50 more than I was supposed to do. An entire night is $150. MARIANNE: Oh, well, you seem to like it, whore. But you didn't do what I paid you for. You didn't even fuck him. And now you dare to ask me for more money? ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: Better just give me the money if you don't want any trouble with Big Jack. Your muscle-pumping arm isn't going to save you. He's going to put his little knife right through it. [LAUGHTER] Don't worry, he won't cut it off-- LUKE: Just give her a chance. ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: You'll still be able to jerk off some clients -with it,of course -LUKE: Just give her the money. ANGIE THE PROSTITUTE: --earning him back the money he lost. And [inaudible] with the monster. Just give her the money, mom. Well. Here. Now get the hell out of my house. [DOOR CLOSES] Am I really that ugly? Then you can just say it. Go ahead, say it to my face. [SUSPENSFUL MUSIC BUILDING] [YELLING] FATHER JULIO GRITTY: Luke, if you don't talk, God won't be able to forgive you your sins. LUKE: You aren't God. But when you don't want to tell it to God, you could at least tell it to your uncle. You promised it. So... How was the little party? LUKE: She tried to eat me. Ah, it's a good sign. She loves you, like I love you, and God loves you. Lovers eat other, you know? LUKE: Nature, perhaps? You know, Luke, when I first saw you, your mother asked me to baptize you. Remember? You were so cute. I'd rather eaten you. LUKE: I've been with a hooker. In my opinion, hookers are a bit like Big Macs. At first you're hungry, you really want them. But the moment a piece of meat is in your belly, you feel sick about it. LUKE: She was standing at my door. Mom called her after my date disaster. She seemed real nice, real sweet. She touched me and I touched her. And the morning after, I found out that I gave her the creeps. Now I feel so dirty. Feeling dirty is a way of repenting.
