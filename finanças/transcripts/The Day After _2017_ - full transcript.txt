Why go out so early? Not now, I'll go out a bit later. What are you going to do? Why go out early? Because I can't sleep. Why can't you sleep? I just keep waking up. Something bothering you? What would bother me? You're acting strange these days. - I am? - Yeah. How? Your face... Yeah? It's different from before. My face is different? Really? And you lost weight.

What are you talking about? Don't you? And you losing weight? It's weird! Huh? Look at me, for real. Are you seeing someone? Why don't you speak? Why don't you speak? Wait. Wait. Don't embarrass me, Tell me. Are you seeing someone? What? You're seeing someone. Right? Honey! I'm fine. Are you sure? Want to come in? No. You won't come in? No. You should go in. Okay. Thanks for your help. I'll come early tomorrow. All right. Let's meet early tomorrow. I'll wait in the office. Take your time coming, you drank a lot. Just a minute. Let's go in here. Just a minute. Okay. Bongwan. Changsook. Bongwan. What? You're a beautiful person. Really? Me, really? Yes. You really are. It's you. You're the beautiful one. Really? It's you. I love you. Honey. I was too sensitive. I'm okay, don't worry. I must be a menopause. - Want some coffee? - Hello. - Any problem getting here? - No. Shall I make some coffee? Yes, thank you. I'll do it from now on. Doesn't matter who makes it. Congratulations on your first day. Thank you. Is it worth congratulations? Sure it is. Kang Publishing House How is the coffee? - Wow, it's great. - Good. But actually, I've no real taste for coffee. Really? Prof. Hwang recommended you strongly. Thank you. Have you known him a long time? I met him long ago, but... I just run into him here and there. I'm such a fan of his writing, I'm always glad to see him. I see. Yeah. Then, who do you live with? Now I live alone. I had a roommate before, but we had a falling out. A falling out? It was a really old friend. Then what caused you to fall out? Just... we found out we had different ideas about life. Too late... That happens. If you're alone... what about your parents? My mother's in Incheon, and my father... passed away. He must have Passed away early. He moved out when I was little. They divorced then. He was alone that winter. One morning he collapsed in the bathroom. Oh my... He really had no one. I feel so sorry for him. He was a really good person. Then do you have siblings? An older brother. My older sister died of cancer three years ago. - You're the youngest. - Yes, I am. I see. What kind of cancer? Uterine... I see. She was much prettier than me. She was very feminine, and such a good person. That's a shame. Yes, it's a real shame. I was closest to her among my family. Really? She was such a beautiful person. You'll do great. We'll do our best, have fun. Let's do our best. - Thank you. - Sure. Sorry. I'm not usually this way. Changsook. Yeah? Want to have lunch? Yes, just a minute. What? I know that pool hall. I know here. - You've been here? - Yes, I have. So it joins up there. Miss Song... So that we can work together comfortably, shall we drop formalities? What? So, how about using informal speech? Yes, that's fine. - We'll be casual. - Yes. - Let's do our best. - Yes, I'll do my best. What does Areum mean? - It just means beauty. - Right, beauty. - It's a good name. - My father named me. Then how should I call you? You can just call me Boss. Boss? - How could I? - Why not? Shouldn't I call you President? I like Boss better. That's what I am. I don't preside over anyone. I'm the boss of a publishing company. Okay, you're right. Boss is good. The sunlight is so pretty. Yes, it is. It's so pretty. What's the title of your piece in the contest? - The title? - Yeah, what's the title? - The title... - Why? What does the title matter? Please look at it later. All right. You judge that contest, right? Occasionally. Because they pay me. Really? Were you ever shortlisted? No. How many years have you entered? - Six years. - Six years... I see. What? Why enter if I have no talent? I never said that. No, not at all. You look young for your age. Me? Really? Wow, there's not a single wrinkle on your neck. You noticed? It's genetics. My mother is 85, - but she has no wrinkles. - Really? - That's amazing. - Isn't it? - Look, I don't have any either. - Yes. Boss. You write so well. How do you write that well? Thanks. No, I really mean it. You're one of the 3 or 4 best critics in Korea. - You read my writing? - Of course. - Lucky you, to write so well. - What are you talking about? Let's have some soju. No. My face will turn red. Like a tomato. It's hideous. Who cares if it does? It's pretty. No, it's terrible. - I'll pour... - No. Sorry. Show me your writing later. Okay. I'm curious. I'm curious what you'll say. Can I ask you something? Sure. Can I ask anything at all? What's this? Ask. Why do you live? Why do I live? I don't know. How should I know? The fact that we're here, or us being born, none of that is our intention, is it? You don't know why you live? Well, love? Are you looking for a word like that? So you really don't know. But how can we know something like that? Corning up with some words and believing in them... that has no connection to reality. That's just thinking up words. It's not connected. Reality is separate. Are you okay living without knowing? - What? - Is it possible to live like that? No, I want to know. If there's something worth believing. But I won't believe just anything. Not just anything, there are things you can really believe in. So... right. How is your belief related to reality? How would I know? I just try. I know I should believe, so I do. But can words really capture reality? Have you ever thought that? I've read about these things. So? But what's reality? If reality is unknowable, then it must not exist. Your presumption to know reality, which is unknowable, is a lie, isn't it? But reality does exist. Words can't describe it, but we can feel it. - Can you feel reality? - Sure. But... is that feeling grounded in reality? That, too... how do you know it's not a construction of your mind? Anyway, things expressed in words have no bearing on reality. Because words are too crude. Honestly, saying that seems lazy or cowardly. Cowardly? That's cowardly? Because having your own belief, and living faithfully by that belief is too hard. Living faithfully, huh? You need to find that belief. That belief makes you healthier and happier. Refusing that belief we urgently need, because of that illusion you call reality, isn't it silly of us? I guess you do know something. You're smarter than I thought. - I'm not smart. - No, really. You're very smart. - Good. - Thank you. I've found someone good. Prof. Hwang made a good recommendation. No. Really. Then what do you believe in? That I'm not the master of my self. That I'm not a leading character. Not in the least. And second, that I can die at any time. I really believe that's okay. Third, that everything is okay. That actually, everything is beautiful. Always. I believe in this world. That's nice. Why did I meet someone like you? Why are you such a coward? You really think I'm a coward? Aren't you? Don't you know? If you stop... if you stop lying to yourself, don't you see it? You say I lie to myself? Of course. Every day you go home and lie. You lie to look good to others. You smile at her without love. You bring home bags of chips. You bring home steamed buns. - What else do you bring? - Is that what you think? Yes. - I'm not a coward. - Yes, you are! Don't say that. - I'm not a coward. - Yes, you are! You're a gutless coward. A real, stinking coward. Should I call her right now? Should I? Call her. Do it. You want me to call home now? Call her. - But you won't do it. - You think I won't? No, you won't! Sorry, but you won't. Because you're a coward. I'm not a coward! Don't you say that! I'm not a coward! Don't you shout at me! How can you... If you think that way, how can you love me? You're a coward. Regardless of love. But... I really hate it. Want to see my daughter's photo? I've seen it. You showed me your pretty daughter's photo all the time! Am I really a coward? Just believe it. Because it's true. It's easier that way, right? Sure, that's easy. You're right. I'm a coward. You're right. You coward. You're a real coward. You're such a coward! Do you work here? Yes. Get over here. Who are you? Don't you know? I'm the boss's wife. So you're that cunning bitch? What? How dare you? You dirty little bitch! Why are you doing this? How dare you do this to me, you bitch! What are you talking about? What's with you? Don't you know? You should know what you did! Are you insane? Why hit me? How dare you hit me? You deserve a beating. You're completely mad! Where are you going? Get back here! You are my light. Inside your light, I am healed. Such beautiful, such human things become part of me day by day. Seeking your light, I hurry down dark morning paths. In this way you have made me a man, and you have become my heaven. I'm done reading. Sit down, don't stand. Yes. - You suit each other. - Stop it! It's not her. How'd you find this? It's not her? Give me a break. This person here, she's my employee. You made a mistake. I'm sorry. You think I'll believe that? It's not her, I'm telling you! Why do you keep lying? It's not a lie. You misunderstood. Misunderstood? I misunderstood? I know what dirty things you've been up to! Why don't you speak? Just admit it! Hey. I wrote this ages ago. Just forget it. It's all over. It's all over? Yes, it's over. She has nothing to do with it. Today was her first day at work. Apologize to her. Apologize? Why should I? Huh? Why should I apologize? How can you lie so shamelessly? It's not her! What's with you? Are you going to make me miserable? Don't do this to me. That's not it, dummy. It's not her. Then who is it? Who is she? The one you're dying to see every morning? She's gone. She quit. She quit? When did she quit? A month ago. A month? Well, about two months. Bastard, lying again. I'm not lying! Anyway, it's not her. Okay? What's your name? Why? Why do you want to know? Areum. Song Areum. It's her first day at work! It's your first day? Yes, it's my first day. And my first time in a situation like this. You've got an attitude. So shameless! Who's shameless? You are. You are! Find out who you're talking to before saying that! Don't just shout at anyone. It's really not you? I don't even know what it is. But it's not me. Can I believe you? - Can I really believe you? - It's true! Stop this, okay? Let's stop. Like hell I'll. Then where's that bitch? What's she doing? Is she prettier? You set her up somewhere? Who knows? I don't see her anymore. Give me that note. You hurry down dark morning paths? Why are you hurrying? You left early this morning! I just went out. I just felt like going out. You shameless, lying shit. Then where is she? Where did she go? I don't know, really! She went abroad. Really? - Where'd she go? - I don't know. England, or something. She must be rich. - Did you give her money? - No. - I don't see her or call her. - Then how do you know? Don't lie to me! I heard it from someone! Really? Is it all right? Taste okay? Yes, it's good. Want some soju? Yes, I do. Sure. That tastes good. Really? So why did she quit? It was just too hard for both of us. You didn't make her quit, since it was hard on you? It was hard for us both. What happened to her after that? I don't know. I didn't call. I wanted to, but I held back. Why? Things had run their course. We had reached the end. Did you really love her? Though it's not really for me to ask. I liked her a lot. Why? Are you curious? No. I'm not. It doesn't concern me. You've been through a lot today. I'm sorry. I've thought about it. I'm sorry, but I think I'd better quit. Really? Yes, I think so. Sorry. It's uncomfortable? Why? Why do you want to quit? Your wife was too violent towards me. I know. It was outrageous. I keep thinking it was like an exorcism. Exorcism? What exorcism? There's some bad energy hovering over the office. You did a lot of wrong things with that woman, and that created bad energy inside her. Really? So that's how you see it. And you should call her, to see how she is. You think so? Isn't it better to leave it alone? You're just choosing the easiest path. I don't think so. Here. Thank you. Anyway, I think it's better that I quit. Your wife will prefer that too. Stop it! Work is work. What does she matter? This doesn't concern your work. I think it will matter for her. It'll be uncomfortable. - She'll keep suspecting us. - No. We didn't do anything wrong, what do you care about? You'll be great at this job. Quitting because of this is just wrong, you know? Maybe I deserved a beating. What? You deserved it? That must be why it happened. But what did you do? I talked about what I believe... Remember? Yeah. People in this field sneer if you mention God. It's unfashionable. Yeah. My talk about believing... I believe in God. That's the prayer I make each day to God. I see. I just left the word God out, to make you comfortable. It's shameful. So you believe in God... And that's why I was punished. Those people who sneer are absurd. They're ridiculous. That's how people are. They're scared of believing, and if you believe in God, they see you as less intelligent. I get what you mean. It's the first time I was ever hit. Right. It must be. Does it hurt? - Pour me another shot. - Okay. You're a good drinker. No, I'm not. But my face gets red. It's not red now. - Really? - Yeah. Want to go somewhere else? No. Really? Then let's stay here. Anyway, come early tomorrow. Got it? - Can you be on time? - Of course. Good. I'll come early. Let's have fun! Don't worry about anything! Work is work. If you want it so much, I'll go. That's good. Great. I'll go to the restroom. - Me too. - Really? Let's go together. Why should we go together? You first. All right then. What do I do now? What do you mean? Just stay with me. Okay? Really? I want to work with you again. Really? I want to work hard as if nothing happened. I missed that time. Did you? Let's do that. For sure. - I want to start again. - Sure. What does it matter? If we really love each other, then I'm not scared of anything. Right. I'm not scared either. I love you. I love you. Just a minute. Here you are. This is Lee Changsook. - Hello. - Hello. The person who worked with me. She came back. Really? Who is she? Sorry. This is Song Areum. She started working with me today. It's her first day. Say hello. I already did. Right. You hired someone already? It's too fast. You're pretty. She's really pretty. I needed help. You weren't there. Still, it's only been a month. It wasn't like that. You didn't call, or answer. You know I couldn't answer. I needed time to adjust. - I'll use the restroom. - Sure, go ahead. - She started today? - Yeah. Then what about me? What do you mean? You'll work with me. - Really? - Yeah. Can you do that? Of course. All right. Thank you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Let's love each other to death. I guess you'll be going home now? Why? You said you'd work early tomorrow. Right. Are you going home? Yes. Are you going somewhere else? I think we should talk a bit more. - Really? - Yeah. Shall we go to the office? We won't stay long. - All right. - Okay, to the office. - Are you cold? - I'm okay. Let's cross. What is it? You bought three bottles? We don't have to drink it all today. Here. - I should do that. - No, it's my work. Really? Sure. Shall we toast? - Cheers. - Cheers. I've got something difficult to say to Areum. Rather than delay it, and make things harder, I'll just be honest. Yes, tell me. Now that she's back, she'll start working again. But I can only afford one worker, as a small company. So I'm really sorry, but I don't think you can work here. Did you decide that? That's what I need to do. She needs to work here. I'm really sorry. After you begged me to stay... I didn't expect this. Right? Yeah. What to make of this? What do you mean? Wasn't today your first day? Yes, it was my first day. But you act like you worked a month. - Right? - Really? You're pretty shameless. Me? Whatever your situation, business and personal should be separate. I'm being pushed out because of you, and your relationship. But you talk that way? You are a bit shameless. You think I'm shameless? Really? - Did I say something shameless? - No. She really didn't. No no, I'm not trying to hang onto this job. Boss, do you remember? I told you I wanted to quit. You knew already. Answer me! Yeah, you had a hard time. I told you first I'd quit, right? You had a tough day. That's how you expressed your frustration. - What was so tough? - There was an incident. What was it? Boss! Say it plainly. Did I say I wanted to quit or not? All right, what does it matter who said what? What matter is your real intention. My intention? What intention? You didn't really intend to quit, you just needed a way to vent your anger. What? So I went along with your feelings. Why won't you tell me what happened? My wife visited the office earlier. So? What did you go along with? Want me to tell you? No, that's okay. You tell me. - You want to know? - Yes! Tell me. I wrote something to you. My wife found it and brought it here. What was it? But there was nothing I could... Let's talk later. Anyway, I'm really sorry. I don't know what to say. Please don't take it badly. Anyway, let's not work together. Okay? No need to say sorry. You mix business and the personal, and make such a mess of things, I feel a bit lousy. What are you so sorry about? It's only been one day. No, I... Forget it. I'll take some books, okay? Why are you crying? Easy, right? You're doing well. - I've done it before. - Really? This program is easy. Simple to learn. I think so. Your hands are really pretty. Really? They're big. But they're nice. Slender. I prefer scrawny hands like this, rather than plump and feminine. Right. I agree. - I'll let you work. - Okay. Oh, right. These shelves are books we published. If you want any, take them. Really? That's great! Take as many as you want. They're ours. Thank you. ...a rare art that utilizes concrete human forms to reveal the phenomenal disposition and attitude of humans. I guess you've stopped coming home. Why? Are you scared? You two acted well. You could be actors. All you care about is yourself. Sex addict! Hypocrite! Thought you could fool me? You devils! Did you get a message? Huh? Yeah, from home. What did she say? - Want to read it? - Yeah. That's harsh. You must be annoyed. She called us devils. She doesn't even go to church. She sneers at churchgoers. But she calls us devils. How can she say that? But she wasn't talking about us. She said it about that other woman. Right. That's a relief, huh? Still, she found out. It might be a help that she didn't see me. Right. She thinks you're abroad now. No. She doesn't believe a word I said. Anyway, she doesn't know your face. How about... saying you dated her? What? Admit to it. She won't be back anyway. Can you say you broke up with her? I guess I could. So later when you come to work, she'll think you're the new employee, right? That's right. I think that'll work. I think it'll work. Okay. So I admit to dating her. What happens then? I think she'll be a help to us. Your wife saw her in person. And she won't be back. If you tell your wife firmly she won't be back, then it might work. All right. Okay. Let's consider that. But won't you go home? Should I? I really don't want to. And you're here. Go back home. You need to, today. I sleep in the office all the time. Go home. I think you'd better today. Go home, it'll be hard, but tell her firmly. That you talked with her, and it's really over. She won't be back. I think you need to say that. Right now we need to reassure her. Should I? I guess that's best? - All right. - Yeah. It's hard, right? But we need to do this. It's humiliating, but we need to do it. Okay, thanks. I'm really thankful. Let's... be strong. Okay? Yeah. We'll be okay. We'll use her to get through this crisis. Let's do it. Okay. I'm so tired. Take a rest. Then go. Yeah. I'll rest a bit. Okay. You are really into that book. Yes. Does reading books help you in life? A little, I guess. I see. I don't read books. - You don't? - No. I think... I drove you once before. I remember it now. - Really? - Yes. You've got such a unique look. - I'm sure I remember. - I look unique? Sure. You're extremely pretty. Thank you. Don't go around at night, it's dangerous. I don't intend to. Tonight's a bit late. Suddenly it's snowing hard. Yes, it's snowing a lot. It's pretty! Isn't it beautiful? This snow... it's really pretty at night. Yes, it's such a blessing. Lord, I pray. You are everything, and everything is in your embrace. So let all be done according to your will, exactly as you wish. Hello. Yes, hello. Sorry, no one was here so I came in. I was looking at books. Sure, go ahead. Would you like coffee? Yes, thank you. No problem. I was about to have some myself. - Is the coffee okay? - Yes, it's great. Good. Congratulations on your prize. Thank you. Yesterday I treated friends with the prize money. I really overdid it. - Did you? - I drank so much. Congratulations, really. I wanted to say that. It was long overdue. I was really happy. Thank you. It was so sudden, I was taken aback. No, you really deserve it. You write so well. Oh my. What are you doing these days? I'm writing every day. And working part time. - You write every day? - Yes, I make sure to do that. It's my routine. That's nice. What else do you do? It's cold, but I take a walk every day. - Where do you live? - In Sajik-dong. - Sajik-dong, by Seochon? - Yes. Which school did you attend? - Konkuk University. - I see. - You can speak informally. - No, no. You live alone, then? Yes, I live alone now. Your parents are somewhere else? Yes, my parents... My mother lives in Incheon, and my father passed away. He passed away? He must have died quite early. Yes. He died quite early. How did he die? A stroke. I see. In the bathroom, one morning. Right. That happens often. Need to be careful on winter mornings. And you have siblings? Yes. My sister passed away. And I have a brother. How could she pass away so young? Yes. You were close to her? I liked her best of all. I see. Were you two similar? No. She was much more feminine than me. Really? Do you have any recently published work? No, not yet. I'm submitting it. - Where? Literary contests? - Yes. What's the title? Of the piece you did most recently? I'm not very good at titling my work... The title's not important. It's just a title. Am I taking too much of your time? No, no. It's not that, I just... - When we... - What? I mean... oh god... That time... how did we end up drinking together? You don't remember who I am? What? Not really. I'm sorry. My memory... I remember! I remember now! It's you! Right? I remember, really. And your name too. Areum, right? - Yes. - Right? You didn't remember me? Wait, did we speak informally back then? I don't remember. Sure, that's possible. I remember it at all. You worked here one day? Yes, just one day. Great. It's great to see you. Thank you for coming. As I said, I wanted to congratulate you. - Thank you. - It's nothing. Here you are. Wow, it's so cold. Thanks for your help. Are we going to eat? I'm so hungry. Should we eat? Should we go out? Let's order in. It's cold. The high is -3. - What should we have? - What do you want? We're going to eat, will you join us? No thanks, I'm fine. Chinese food? - Good. - All right. Why don't you order something? I'm fine. I had a late lunch. Really? - What will you have? - Me? - Well, black bean noodles? - Okay. The Chinese restaurant here is really good. Really? I think I went there. Right. That's right. It's the same place. You went there. Oh my... I don't see that woman. Who? Oh, her? How is she? I'm not sure. Haven't seen her. - Really? - Yes. We spoke informally then, right? I don't remember. Yeah. It's okay, I don't either. Your face seems to have changed. Really? How? You look more comfortable. - Really? - Yes, you look different. Do I? Is everything okay? What, me? - Oh, her? - Yes. After seeing you then, I left home. Was it a month? I stayed out for a month, then I returned home. I never saw her after that. - I see. - Yeah. I was staying at her house, then my wife brought my daughter there. At night. Really late at night. She brought my daughter. She dressed her up in an English-style blue coat. She had done her up so pretty. The moment I saw my daughter, I decided right there. To live for my daughter. To forget everything else, and just live for her. To give up on my life. I made up my mind. It didn't take a second. You'd been living with her then? Yes. She had a townhouse, with two really small rooms. The rooms were tiny. I lived there. So you don't know what she's doing. I don't know. She was really hurt, and that's how it ended. I was such a fool. Don't lose heart. Then I got this prize. That's right. - Because I returned home? - That's not it. Right? - Are you really not hungry? - I'm okay. Okay. Since you're here, you want some books? You can take them. I took a lot last time. Did you? Good for you. - Miss Song! - Yes? Just a second. Take this. I really like it. You take it. It's Soseki. It's newly translated. I like this book so much. Thanks, I'll read it. It's great. He wrote so well. He did. Well... Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye.
