Loyal readers, my favorite holiday is just around the corner. Christmas means joy, excitement, family, love and lights. It also means my first year as Queen of Aldovia is nearly under my belt. And just... Wow! What a year. Royal life has a way of transforming everything. As the year began, Richard and I enjoyed a magical honeymoon. Once home, our revised new Aldovia initiative continued to grow. And that's how we'll fund the tech center. And the new hospital. And quickly began paying dividends. As did my efforts to learn about Aldovia's history and families. That knowledge is very helpful at functions like Royal State dinners. And the people of Aldovia are fully embracing their Queen Amber of New York. This year has been super busy, but next year is gonna be... even busier. Richard, this way! Congratulations on the baby! Over here! Beautiful! Have you chosen the baby's name? No. Are you expecting a boy or a girl? - We haven't found out yet. - We're waiting to be surprised. You've updated Aldovia's line of succession to include females. Does that mean it's a girl? It means that we are hoping to bring Aldovia into the 21st Century culturally, just as the new Aldovia initiative has done economically. Will you at least tell us the baby's due date? January the 11th. Will you be taking time off? - Yes. - Starting in two days time, following the centennial treaty signing with the Kingdom of Penglia. Our last official duty of the year. Now are there any policy questions, economic queries, foreign affairs? No. About the baby. Do you have any names to share? No. Have you truly not chosen the name? You won't give up, will you? Well, I'd be delighted to finally know what names you're considering. We're not telling anyone, Mother. We're all family here. What Richard said. - For a girl, I say Khaleesi. - Hermione is lovely as well. Claudette is a family name I'm very fond of or Claude for a boy. Well, if it is a boy, I won't be offended if you decided to name him Simon, or Simone for a girl, obviously. All lovely names, we will take them under advisement. Your Majesty, in a few weeks' time when the baby arrives, the surprise will be all the sweeter. You always put things in perspective. I just hope I'm half as beautiful as Amber is when I become pregnant. That's an unsettling thought to put into your mother's head. Not nearly as unsettling as your continued presence. Your Majesties, you have a guest. I wonder who on Earth that could be. Surprise! Melissa! Oh, you look fantastic! I feel like a watermelon. But it's so great that you could surprise me early for the baby shower. I am early, but that's not actually the surprise. Simon's invited me to stay through Christmas. A fabulous idea, if I may say so. Wow, great! It's so good to see you. Yeah. You too. So, are you daddy ready? Getting there, I think. Staying with someone's family over Christmas is a big deal. - She should've told us. - She wanted to surprise you. She knows how you feel about Simon. - Well, I don't trust him. - No, neither do I. He has behaved all year. In the hope that we'll give him an official position. Which we haven't. I just don't want Melissa to get hurt. Let them be. We have more important issues to attend to. Like my birth plan. And the baby's musical enrichment. I'm pretty sure research debunked the myth that classical music makes your baby smarter. Classical music makes everybody smarter, which I need to be to build this crib. Instruction manual's more complicated than differential calculus. Taxi! Oh! Hey, Pop. Hey Peanut. I'm almost packed. What's cracking in Aldovania? You still can't say it right. Pack warmly, it's cold here. Now why couldn't you marry the king of some tropical paradise? She sunburns too easily. Did you figure out how long you can stay yet? Gus is gonna cover the diner, so I can stay from the baby shower all the way until little Rudy's birth. - Pardon me? - Oops! Sorry. Prince Rudy's birth. - Pop! - Hey, I'm just saying. Amber, what are you doing out here? It's so cold. - Just getting some air. - You should've woken me up. You need your sleep. You know, when the baby comes. What do you have there? Nothing. Don't judge my cravings. Never. What do they call it? Sympathetic weight gain syndrome? Don't tattle to Dr. Magoro. I'm supposed to watch my sugars. You have my word. Mm. Fetal heart rate excellent. Amniotic fluid levels superb. Your baby is beautiful. Going forward, anything special we should do? Avoid special as much as possible. Queen Amber needs her rest and relaxation, nothing more. That sounds ideal. Hello, can we get a peek? I'd love to see my little grandchild. Can you print a copy for auntie Mel? If you want to know if it's a boy or a girl, you'll be disappointed. Foiled again. Try harder next time. Just what the doctor ordered. Nothing is more important right now than time to ourselves. Ooh... To quote your sister, I'm not a china doll. No, you're far more valuable. I want you both to have the best of everything, including sleigh rides. I've been thinking, and I want this baby to have a normal life, as normal as possible. Our child will be heir to the Kingdom. Still, I went to public school, I played with neighborhood kids. I went to boarding school and played polo. I was riding a subway by myself when I was ten, and I ate diner food. I had nannies to make sure I ate my vegetables. - I turned out all right. - So did I. We'll find a new definition of normal together. - No boarding school. - No boarding school. But no subway riding, either. Well, luckily for you, Aldovia doesn't have a subway. Your Majesties, with an eye to the Penglians' official visit and treaty signing proceeding as smoothly as possible, we feel a review is prudent. Thank you for making the time. Well, this is the last of the time you will get of our Queen, for the rest of the year will be dedicated exclusively to the preparations for the birth of the royal baby. Of course. Mr. Little. The centennial treaty renews an ancient truce between Aldovia and Penglia that dates back to a war 600 years ago. That was the war over Silk Road trading routes, right? You've studied your history, Queen Amber. It was a fearsome and brutal war with no end in sight. Finally, on Christmas Eve 1419, Prince Claude of Aldovia and Prince Jun of Penglia, inspired by the season of peace and goodwill, found a way to end the conflict. Just before midnight, on that fateful Christmas Eve 1419, the truce was declared and the treaty signed. The treaty, your Majesties. To honor the peace and friendship between our nations, the treaty has been ceremonially renewed every 100 years since, without fail. The artistry is incredible. It's a treasured artifact. It's been under our protection since 1919. And after the signing, it goes back to Penglia for the next hundred years. It's beautiful, with the signatures of every king. I'll be the first queen to sign it. You will, indeed. As long as the royals from Penglia agree. Whilst Aldovia boldly plunges into the 21st Century, this treaty dates back to the 15th Century. We'll have to proceed very carefully, Amber. The Penglians are our closest allies but, in many respects, they are quite traditional. An attitude personified by the Queen of Penglia, Queen Ming. Compared to Queen Ming, even Mrs. Averill comes off as rather carefree. I have my carefree moments. I had one last Sunday. I love a challenge. I can't wait to meet Queen Ming. They shall be here momentarily. Now come on, everybody. Move into place, quickly. Once they exit, meet them in the center. King Richard will give a formal greeting. Welcome to Aldovia. A most hearty welcome. We're here to celebrate a hand clasp on a battlefield 600 years ago. That changed the fate of both our nations. King Richard, so glad to finally meet you in person. Good to see you too, King Tai. May I introduce my wife, Queen Amber. An honor. You're as lovely and charming as they say. My wife, Queen Ming of Penglia. - Queen Ming. - I'm most pleased to be here. And to finally lay eyes on the famous Queen Amber of New York. Wonderful to meet you, Queen Ming. And you. I'm Amber, hi. Lynn is our attach√©. Oh. Lynn? Fantastic! Beautiful. No one does Christmas like the Aldovians. Thank you. We do our best. If Emily had her way, we'd have a tree in every room. Actually, I believe you do. Indeed, Tom. We have quite a bit of mistletoe too. That's spectacular. So, how do you two know each other? We studied together, Oxford. I studied. Simon... caroused. I may have enjoyed the occasional night out, but I'm not the one whose picture... - Hey, hey, hey! - ...is hanging in the King's Arms Pub. Red for you, your Highness. And sparkling water for you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Mr Zabala. It appears you've adapted comfortably to your new role. I like to think so. Not to say there haven't been growing pains. What with the Belgravians here, in Aldovia, as well, it seems royals marrying outside of noble classes has become quite fashionable. And now your first child on the way. Congratulations. Providing your kingdom with an heir is historically a Queen's utmost duty. Oh, I don't see it as a duty at all. Richard and I are simply excited to start our family. You have three children of your own? Yes. Harry is 13. Vivian and Amanda are ten. Twins? I can't even imagine. I have to admit, I was excited to finally meet the playboy prince. I enjoyed living vicariously through your exploits in the press. It's all greatly exaggerated. I was actually hoping to talk some business with you. Business? Quite honestly, I prefer to leave that tedium to Lynn. Congratulations on your new position, very impressive. It's a start, but I soon hope to be accomplishing more. Ambitious as ever. What's your role at the palace? Cousin to the King, but you know me, working the angles. Oh, you always do. Pardon me, got to take this. Angles of my own. Mm... She's a live wire. Enjoying yourself? Of course, yeah. Are you familiar with Aldovia's modernization efforts? I'm familiar with all aspects of Aldovia's policy. Given its success, I spoke with Richard and we feel that you and I should add our signatures to the treaty. You wish to modernize our 600 year old tradition? We, the Queens, could bring the tradition up to date. History isn't made by those who follow rules. Your Majesties. May I announce the arrival of the CEO and the Chief Designer from S & A Events International. - Your Majesties. - It's a pleasure to be here. Andy, hi! Sahil! Wow, look at you. You've never looked more beautiful. So this is what you've been doing? Your secret project? Consider Andrew and myself early Christmas gifts. Weddings were too small a niche for such a big talent. We rebranded and expanded Sahil's business. I was happy to give Andrew the opportunity. Design genius meets management expertise. Mrs. Averill engaged us to make sure that you had the most spectacular royal baby shower of all time. - You deserve it. - Thanks. May I also offer our service, free of charge, to the elevation of tomorrow's treaty signing? Elevation? I have seen the artifact. It's a bit tacky, no? It's a priceless work of art. We will be standing by if you need us. Great. Next question. During labor I would like to spend the first stage lying down, standing up, walking around, in the shower or in the tub? Lying down. Walking around. New York, born and raised. Never realized labour came in multiple choice. Testing. Testing. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Let's test it for real. Extraordinary. - Are you seeing this? - Yeah. Whoa... Can you still see me? Amber, hello? This is unbelievable. You're right. This is amazing. Should we try from the nursery? Now transmitting from the nursery. Can you hear me? Amber, hello? Are you there? I need a little help. Is that crying? Amber? What is it? I can't even reach my own slippers. Allow me. Perfect fit. Cinderella was a bit more graceful. But nowhere near as beautiful. This storm could spell disaster. Where's Lynn? I asked for an update four minutes ago. Apologies, Queen Ming. I was speaking to the pilot. And? The storm brought the country to a standstill. All flights have been canceled. How would this affect the treaty signing? The Aldovians wish to proceed the ceremony as scheduled. I agree. Very well. Find us a way home directly afterwards. Our children expect us back. Yes. Such a shame there are so few guests to witness this beautiful event. Yes, I'm afraid no one's been able to travel anywhere today, Your Majesty. Your Majesties. As expected, the Penglians have officially rejected either queen signing the treaty. I'm sorry. In a few minutes, this will all be over and then we can focus on what's most important. You and the baby. There's a little too much red. I think they can do with a little bit more blue, - to be honest. - Yeah. I'm thinking royal blue. Mm... Yeah. Could work. In honor of the sacred treaty, signed on the battlefield on Christmas Eve in the year 1419, the monarchy of Aldovia welcomes King Tai and Queen Ming of Penglia. No. No, no, no. It is my great honor and privilege to preside over the seventh signing of the sacred truce between our realms. The entire Kingdom of Aldovia heartily embraces our alliance with Penglia. What began as a handshake on Christmas Eve has evolved into an ever-growing bond represented by our invaluable, ever-expanding precious treaty. Mr. Little, let the signing begin. How is this possible? Where's the treaty? It's supposed to be there. We do apologize. I'm sure we can get this little mix-up straightened out right away. Well this is certainly embarrassing. If we don't sort this out, we'll all end up in the dungeon. Indeed. Perhaps now it can be replaced with something more palatable. There must be an explanation. Does anyone have any idea what's going on? The treaty was there last night when we checked. - I can confirm. - And now it's vanished. I've been saying that we should update the security protocols ever since... well, you infiltrated the palace. But no one has come or gone since the blizzard. So the treaty must still be in the palace. Along with whoever took it. - What do we do now? - I don't know... Simon. We need your help. You're kidding. Well, I'd be delighted. What can I do for my king and queen? Find a way to occupy our guests while we locate the treaty. It's okay, we'll make sure... I'll make sure everything's sorted. And how am I to do that? You're friends with Lynn. Keep them entertained. Lynn's easy to entertain. Not so sure about the others. One thing is for certain. Just stick with Simon and make sure he doesn't do anything Simon-like. I'll be your eyes and ears. I know what might be a bit of fun. Is this some kind of game? Top of the tree, a classic Aldovian Christmas game. Wow, I haven't played this since I was a kid. Shockingly good idea, Simon. Two teams compete, the goal being to decorate your side of the tree first. The team that places the star on top of the tree wins. You want us to play a children's game in the midst of this scandal? Well, it's an unfortunate delay, it's not really a scandal, yet. Simon has a great talent for games. He's definitely talented at many things. Ornaments are awarded for answering questions about famous royal traditions and legends. Count me in. Our children would enjoy this. I'll go and inform them about the delay. Of course. It's a pity though, we should have even teams. Well, I'm happy to sit out if it helps. I'm not exactly a whiz at royal traditions yet. I'll join King Tai. I embrace any opportunity to beat Simon. I like your spirit, Princess. Well, guess that makes it... you and me. - Would you like to start? - Yes, please. Any luck? Not yet. We know the treaty was here last night. We know that nobody's entered or left the palace. Are you proposing we make a list of suspects? Investigative journalism 101. The treaty didn't fly away on its own. Did you notice the look that Simon and Lynn exchanged when the treaty went missing? And Sahil called it tacky. I wouldn't put it past him. Who in this palace had the means, the opportunity, the motive? - Did you take it? - No. Neither did I. That's two down. Very funny. Lynn. This is an easy one. In the legend "Princess Froon," Grendel's pet is what animal? Even I know this one, from your Christmas pageant. - Don't you dare say. - Turtle! Yes, well played. One more and we win. Tweet, tweet, tweet. That is beautiful. Do you see that, Melissa, what she made? It's amazing. I can make you one. Actually, I need to get some air. Melissa! Melissa... Wait! We should probably check on Ming. A pity, Princess Emily, we would have won. Sorry. This game was a favorite in my family, too. Final question. Who was Aldovia's greatest king and father? That isn't a real question. But you know the answer. My father. The star. You win. Will you do the honors? As you wish. Hey! Where are you going? Simon and I need some alone time. Melissa suggested a walk in the snow. What about the Penglians? Well Emily's more than capable and my priority is Melissa. Mel, can we talk a sec? Yeah, sure. I'll see about clearing a path. My hero! What's up? Well, you and Simon, for one thing. I never realized you were so close. We talk for hours every night. He's really smart, funny, super cute and really misunderstood. Misunderstood? Mel, all your bad boys have left you heartbroken. He's more than just a bad boy. He cares about me. It's starting to feel real, you know? We are just worried about his intentions. Have you seen the way he looks at Lynn? He swears Lynn is just a friend. I don't know, sometimes I get a little insecure, out of my depth with royals, you get that. Yeah, but you don't know Simon like we do. And you don't know Simon like I do. I appreciate you looking out for me, but Simon and I... we're in love. Wow! Not just like a lot or heavily infatuated? I want it to work. I hear you. Has the treaty been found? It pains me to say no, Your Majesty. After our initial survey, we can assume it's nowhere obvious. Your Majesty, please, be assured no one will rest until it's located. Thank you. Because, according to the treaty's terms, if it's not renewed by midnight on Christmas Eve, Aldovia and Penglia technically return to a state of war. Should be interesting, as neither country has a standing army. Emily, I thought you were with our guests. Simon had to end the game abruptly. They've returned to their rooms. This situation is just so inelegant. Please, continue to search. Your Majesty. Is this about the treaty? Mother, did you read this? "If there comes a day the sacred truce is broken, the Kingdom disrupting the peace shall suffer a dreadful fate: upon the firstborn a beshrew." What's a beshrew? It's a curse. People believed in things like that back then. How did it work? A sorceress would conjure a spell to ensure that the two kingdoms upheld the treaty. So, if we don't sign the treaty by Christmas Eve, there'll be a curse on the firstborn child? That's Amber and Richard's baby. Sorcery fell out of favor centuries ago. Emily, we're not going to bother anyone with this nonsense. But what if it isn't nonsense? Ow! What is it? Baby's kicking a lot. Amazing. Little striker in there. More likely upset about my chat with Melissa. Does Simon have an alibi? No idea, but she thinks he's a great guy, says they're in love. Love is blind. Perhaps sleuthing while pregnant isn't the best idea. I may be expecting and Queen, but I'm still a journalist. And right now, my investigation needs your help. Not now, Andrew. I'm in the zone, designing. Andrew! Andrew... Oh. Your Majesty. Please, come... come in. Sorry to disturb you, Sahil. I have a design question about the nursery. Do you have a moment? Now? Of course, Your Majesty. I appreciate this. It's about the best location for the crib, given the layout. Spatial flow is absolutely crucial. I have studied the Aztecs, Mongols and Zulus to arrive at my own theories. - I should get my tape measure. - No, no, no, no! I mean I have a royal tape measure waiting for us. Oh! I am envisioning monochrome with geometric prints. Sahil? Hi, Eddie. Andrew. Amber. Is Sahil here? - No, I was just... - Just... Helping with the search. Sahil called the treaty tacky. I went too far. Don't be mad at me. Mad? Look, I work with the guy daily. I get it. He's opinionated. It was a lead. We follow leads, remember? I do, it's just we have a multi-million dollar business now and Sahil would never risk it. Multi-million dollars, really? Yeah. So if you wanna write a story, write about us. - Like a puff piece? - Exactly. - After the baby, of course. - Of course. Tell me you had success. Thanks to your little ruse, the last hour's felt like a month. - Once Sahil gets in the zone... - He didn't take it. You're right, I don't need to focus on this missing treaty. No, you absolutely don't. Actually, you do. Emily. I'm not meant to tell you this because it's probably rubbish. But... a curse will befall the King and Queen responsible for breaking the treaty. Seriously? A curse? Concocted by a sorceress to ensure the treaty wasn't broken. Sorcery. Hardly a cause for concern. If the treaty isn't signed in time, by midnight Christmas Eve, it takes effect. Why are you putting stock in this nonsense? It's a curse on your firstborn. On this baby? Our baby. According to the history book. The chance of this being real is infinitesimal. I don't care if it's one in a billion, I'm not risking it. We need to find this treaty. Attention, flight 1225 to Aldovia is still canceled. Eh, no clue when they'll start letting flights in, but I'll be on the first one as soon as they do. How about you guys, how you doing? Honestly, disaster on all fronts. Melissa is in love with Simon. We have to cancel tomorrow's baby shower, the treaty is missing and if we don't find it by midnight on Christmas Eve, our baby is cursed. Hold on, you're gonna have to explain that one. - It's a long story. - Emphasis on story, and we have until Christmas Eve to sort it out. Tomorrow's only the 23rd. Well, I don't know much about this supernatural stuff, but go easy on Melissa, huh? Love makes people do funny things. You gave up New York slices and bagels for meat jelly. Oh! Could you please bring me some bagels? You got it. Now, why'd you cancel your baby shower? No one can get here. The storm. There's plenty of people in the palace. Have it anyway. It just doesn't feel like the right time. From what you're saying, sounds like a little hope and joy is just what the palace needs. Have the shower. A curse upon the firstborn, upon the firstborn... Richard. The Royal Scandal of the Fathers of the Silk Road Treaty. Royal scandal? Did you know there was a love triangle between Prince Claude and Prince Jun over Claude's newlywed, Princess Jocelyn? I believe they taught us that at boarding school. Oh my gosh! Soon after the royal treaty was signed, Prince Claude was poisoned. Many believed Prince Jun did it. The house of Devon, Claude's family, fell out of power and Claude's descendants swore vengeance. Devon. Why does that name sound familiar? You're up early, my dear. Oh, I couldn't sleep. Baby had a restless night. One day, you'll look back on all the sleepless nights and you'll realize they're amongst your sweetest memories. It's a big change, isn't it? It's the greatest adventure, but your life will never be the same again. There are so many things that I wish I could ask my mom. Amber, never forget that she's right here. Her spirit's in you and your baby. She gave you good instincts and, through your baby, she'll guide you, always. I'm so grateful I have you. I'm here. For anything. When you were expecting Emily, did you try hypnobirthing? Hypnobirthing? What on earth is hypnobirthing? Fear causes the body to tense up and pain in childbirth becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So you're saying no pain is really an option? Language is powerful and we want to have a positive view of birth. For instance, instead of contractions, we'll call them surges. - Surges? - Like a surge of energy? Exactly. Your body is powerful. And during labor, every surge you feel is a wave of relaxation, pleasure and love. Hm. Lucky you, men don't get those. I want you both to lie back and close your eyes. I'm going to lead you into a guided imagery meditation. Imagine a surge, relaxation, pleasure, love. Feel its pulse. We thought we'd be home by now, too. No, you may not peek at your presents. We'll be home as soon as we're able. Love you! Bye, now. This predicament must be resolved. If only the children were stuck here with us, wouldn't be so bad. No place is more Christmassy. Leave it to you to find light in any situation. I assume that's why you keep me around. Still, I'd like to find a way home. If we don't stay to sign the truce treaty, our kingdoms technically return to a state of war. Of course, a war that would be fought by lawyers. Just a thought. What if the Aldovians orchestrated this on purpose? They want the treaty signed just as much as we do. Unless it's a way for them to force an unfair renegotiation of terms. Renegotiation under duress? No. Good day, Your Majesties. Forgive me, am I interrupting? Not at all. May I present, with the compliments and best wishes of Queen Amber of Aldovia. Thank you and good day. Hm. An invitation to attend Queen Amber's royal baby shower. Today. Amber! Wow. Oh my goodness. It's amazing! Seriously? Your Majesty, our gift from S&A Events International. Sahil, you have really outdone yourself. And you, Andy. We're here to celebrate new life and strong bonds. Thank you. Baby guessing game. I love it! Ladies and gentlemen, please, our Queen. That's me. There I am, there. And who is this little cutie? Yeah, that's... that's me. Me. Never would have guessed. Oh my goodness, look at this! It's so cute! Thank you so much, guys. Will you look at this little bear. Oh, that is... Look at the little ears. So cute! For you. Did you make this? Today. Thank you so much. That's so sweet. Queen Amber, King Richard. My gift is a song. ‚ô™ Hark the herald angels sing ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Glory to the new born king ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Peace on earth and mercy mild ‚ô™ ‚ô™ God and sinners reconcile ‚ô™ Thank you. King Tai played beautifully. Everyone adores King Tai. He is the only leader Penglia needs. But he's not the only leader Penglia has. You and King Richard are truly a team. I do admire that. I think you deserve more credit. Credit is not something I seek. Looks like our queens are getting along nicely. Happy wife, happy life. Speaking of which, mind if we slip out for a moment? Sure. Excuse me. Please, could you tell me the status on the search of the treaty? Well, we remain certain it's still in the palace. King Richard has called for a specially trained police dog to sniff out the artifact. The dog arrives tomorrow morning. Okay. Thank you. I promised I'd build the crib on my own but I found the instructions impenetrable. I remember building our baby's crib. Took me a month. We each rule a kingdom. This can't be beyond us. We'll build like we lead, by instinct. I never knew how complicated preparing for a baby would be. Did it take you a long time to feel comfortable with fatherhood? Only until the birth, then it was automatic. I never experienced feeling that type of love before. When the most dire problem in the kingdom pales to a scuffed knee, you know you are a parent. I read more of that history book today and you know what? This isn't the first time the treaty's disappeared. It's not? Two hundred years ago, there was another incident, here in Aldovia. The thief made off with the treaty, but was caught red-handed. Spent the rest of his years locked in a dungeon. Princess Emily, please don't fret, I have never heard of such a legend. And nor have I. I have. I started working for your grandparents when I was just a lad. They told me that the ghost of that wretched thief still roamed the darkest depths of the dungeon, searching for his coveted prize. - I've never heard such nonsense. - Neither have I, Your Majesty. I was of the same mind, Your Majesty. Then, one Christmas Eve, despite all the warnings, I snuck into the dungeon. And? I heard a tortured moaning. Then I felt a chilling breeze... and then... I ran. Okay, so this is my favorite. - Aw! He's so cute! - I know. Queen Helena said that it was Richard's favorite childhood toy. Mr. Paddy Claw Paws. Oh... I hope you have veto rights on your baby's name. Oh, okay, very good. I can't believe you made this for me. - I hope you like it. - I love it. It's a special Penglian pattern my grandmother taught me. She must've been very talented. - She was. - Thank you. I appreciate it. Have you guys seen this part? They're such fun. I think we're almost done here. Looks like it. I'm sorry for all the strife the treaty has caused. Well it's not your doing the treaty disappeared, right? Well, it's not that. I know that Ming was uneasy about the idea of her and Amber signing it. I'm happy for Ming to sign, but she's worried what our people will think if she seeks credit, despite all she does for Penglia. Aldovia has embraced Queen Amber. Penglia adores Ming. She deserves her due. Not bad for a couple of kings on their own. - Look at that. - Huh. - Uh-oh... - What? Pretty sure this is meant to be on the outside. Is it? Do you think it matters? I think it might. You really haven't missed a beat. You... are not so bad yourself. I think we deserve everything that's coming to us. There's something I want to show you. Come with me. - Simon! - Melissa, I... I was... How about some tea? What's that you're hiding? Nothing. What's really going on with you and Lynn? What's going on? I told you, she's just an old friend. Okay. We dated, briefly, at school. Two dates, three at the most. We quickly realized we're better suited as friends. Now, about that tea. Amber was right about you. An early Christmas gift. You two can match. Melissa. It's Simon and Lynn together. What's going on? What's wrong? You were right about Simon's intentions. He's hiding things. Look at this. This is private financial information about the trade agreement. Is this an assessment of Aldovia's debt to Penglia, a billion euros? That sounds correct. But a year ago it was five billion, and with our economy, it should be gone by spring. Unless the treaty is broken. In which case it's due immediately. Simon's helping Lynn for a piece of the action. Selling out his own kingdom. I say we make a formal accusation. I'll help you make it. I'm so sorry, Melissa. I never wanted to be right about him. I didn't want you to be, either. We have a Malinois, a police dog arriving first thing. Once it sniffs out the treaty, we'll make a move. - Why wait? - We have to have proof. Can't offend the Penglians. As long as this treaty is signed by midnight tomorrow. Meanwhile, I want you to keep an eye on Simon. - I'd rather not look at him right now. - Please. It's important he doesn't suspect a thing. Our baby's future depends on it. On the treaty? How? Sit down. Melissa. You of all people know me better than that. No, it's too pathetic. Melissa, you just don't understand how things work in a palace. No, too arrogant. Melissa, if you could only trust... You came back? I grew up with this breed, Your Majesties. Their sense of smell is unsurpassed. The treaty will be sniffed out imminently. Can you please tell me the status on Aldovia's roadways? Fully plowed by the end of day. And the airport? Rescheduled to open this evening. I've already spoken to our pilot. We depart at first clearing. Have faith. The dog will find it. Mr. Little has advised that we remain outside the palace so the dog can work without distraction. Where are we to go? Aldovia's Christmas market is just a short walk down the hill. It's absolutely magical on Christmas Eve. ‚ô™ It came upon the midnight clear ‚ô™ ‚ô™ That glorious song of old ‚ô™ ‚ô™ From angels bending near the earth ‚ô™ ‚ô™ To touch their harps... ‚ô™ Perfect place to hope for a Christmas miracle. A Christmas Eve miracle. - We only have till midnight. - ‚ô™...goodwill to men ‚ô™ ‚ô™ From heavens all gracious King! ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ The world in solemn stillness lay... ‚ô™ - Oh! It's Queen Amber! It's Queen Amber! - Merry Christmas, Queen Amber! - Oh! So lovely to see you both. Thank you very much. Hi, Merry Christmas. - Hello, merry Christmas. - You look amazing. Thank you so much. - Hello. - Hello. Merry Christmas, Queen Amber. Merry Christmas, Queen Amber. Happy Christmas, King Richard. - Thank you. - Are you enjoying the market? Loving the market. Thank you so much. The people adore their Queen Amber. I'd say they're both beloved. You deserve the same. You should accept the credit for all you do for Penglia. Hi, everyone. Queen Ming, King Tai, do come and join us. ‚ô™ Dashing through the snow ‚ô™ ‚ô™ In a one-horse open sleigh ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Over the fields we go ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Laughing all the way ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Bells on bob-tail ring ‚ô™ - That looks fun. - ‚ô™ Making spirits bright ‚ô™ ‚ô™ What fun it is to ride and sing ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ A sleighing song tonight ‚ô™ - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - I wish. - ‚ô™ Jingle bells, jingle bells ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ O' what fun it is to ride ‚ô™ - Say no more. ‚ô™ In a one-horse open sleigh ‚ô™ I can't believe they let us do this. Sometimes it's very useful to be king. Or a princess. Faster, faster! You asked for it! We will turn you into an extreme winter sports athlete yet. - I'd like to try snow kiting. - Oh! Perhaps next year. You're my witness, Tom. You heard my brother. I did. This looks so fun. I'll see you on the ice, all right? Oh! Come on, keep up! You're such a show-off. - Keep up. - And can't promise anything. Don't fall behind. What? Are you hurt? He's a lot tougher than he looks. I'm really not, actually. I feel like a ballerina! Look at them. That was amazing. For a moment, I almost forgot about everything. It's going to be fine. With us and the baby. I hope so. King Tai. Come on, Ming. It's been too long not skating. Anything else? Archery! That's something I can do. - I challenge anyone to archery. - You may regret it. We have a champion archer in the fold. Champion archer? Me? According to Queen Helena. I've seen her stop an embezzler with her bow. Sounds like a bit of fun. Visiting kingdom shoots first. Richard... Nicely done, my dear. Excellent shot, my Queen. Clear your mind and focus on what's most important. You got this. Excuse me, Your Majesties, a message from the palace regarding the treaty. The dog failed, the treaty remains lost. Whoa. Bullseye! Oh! She's fainted. Let's just make it to the chaise. Really, Richard, I'm okay. I just want to make sure. Doctor Magoro. Sir, it's Dr. Magoro. Thank you. - I understand the Queen's fainted? - Yes. Yes, she fainted, but she's awake now. - She has been overdoing it. - I thought so. You've overdone it. She needs rest. Rest, yes. I'll tell her. Why don't I drive to the palace? We'd be very grateful. Thank you. She's on her way. I told you, I'm fine. Still, you must rest until she gets here. That's doctor's and king's orders. Princess' orders as well. Rest. How can I when we only have until midnight? How long? Great, thank you. The airport is opening shortly. Will you please arrange transport? I will see to it, Miss Lynn. There you are. Sorry, I have some news. The airport is open. The Penglians are leaving. Oh my goodness. Shall I speak to them? - Please, Mother. - Mr. Zabala Yes, of course, Your Majesty. Excuse me. What do we do now? We have to expose Simon and Lynn. It's our last hope to find the treaty. Absolutely. Simon? He and Lynn have been conspiring since she arrived. - That's disgraceful. - But not unexpected. Listen, something is nagging at me. Call it instinct. If we are correct, and Simon and Lynn took the treaty and hid it, why didn't the police dog find it? - We'll have to ask Simon. - But there's more. The old scandal between Prince Claude and Prince Jun. The family swore they would get revenge. Maybe that's why the treaty was nearly stolen 200 years ago. The treaty was stolen before? What, what's wrong? I don't know, cramping. Cramping bad. Oh my gosh. Does that mean... - I think so. - What is it? I'm going into labor. Oh. Hello? King Richard? Doctor, Amber's gone into labor. Labor? Now? No, no, no, she's not due until January, Your Majesty. Her back hurts and she has cramping. Could be forced labor due to over activity. She has been very active. Tell the Queen, deep breaths and remain calm. All right. Thank you, Doctor. See you very soon. Bye. Ooh! - Is it true? Have you gone into labor? - It appears so. - How far apart are the contractions? - Close. Getting stronger. We call them surges as per the doctor who's on her way. This is her. King Richard... I found myself in a bit of a situation. Where are you? North road. Stay in your car. What is it? She's stuck in a snow bank. But the baby's coming. I used to volunteer at a maternity ward. I will help you through this. Tai, cancel our flight. Of course. Lynn! Thank you, Queen Ming. - I'll get Dr. Magoro. - Richard! I'll be back with her as soon as I can. You can do this, birth plan or not. I love you. I love you. Take care of her, please. Richard, we heard about Amber. Is there... - I'll deal with you later. - Wh... Good boy, let's go. I too had the baby come early. - You did? - My son. He's okay? He's intelligent, capable and has the energy of three boys. Your baby will be perfectly fine. Your child is strong, Amber. Like you and Richard. But I can't help but worry that it's going to be midnight soon. If that treaty isn't signed, my baby is cursed. Emily! I told you not to worry Amber with that nonsense. But what if it's true? Sorcery was discredited a long time ago, for good reason. Many old treaties involved punitive superstitions. It's not unusual. Tell me about this one. Well, what I read was about a sorceress that cast a spell. Not tonight. Come on! The curse affects the firstborn child of whichever kingdom causes the truce to break. Typical for its time, but that time is not our time. Still... You don't want to risk it, I understand, as small a chance as it may be. A mother's love for her child is greater than anything. Someone in this palace sabotaged the signing of the treaty. Why? Your Majesty! I've spoken to the doctor and she said it's acceptable to administer pain medication for your... surges. Thank you, Mrs. Averill, but I need to keep my mind sharp. Amber... We all want what's best for your baby and for you. Please try not to worry needlessly. Maybe it isn't needless. It could be real. After all, our dungeon is haunted. - Haunted? - Yes. Mr. Little even encountered it, the ghost of the thief who stole the treaty 200 years ago. Emily, listen to me. I need you to do something for me right now. Why on earth did Amber want us to come down here? She insists we search the furthest corner. Pray we avoid the ghost that haunts this dungeon. You're not scared of the made-up ghost, are you? What was that? Just... Just our imaginations. Working in unison. Come along. Leopold was here. Now we are. Oh, no! Help! Oh, dear. Help! Help us! Help! Please help! Dr. Magoro? - Are you all right? - I am now, thank you. I trust you know how to ride. I do, indeed. You're doing good. Poor thing. This is not the time, Simon. Amber. You look like you could use these. Squeeze these when you're feeling overwhelmed. Works for me. Thank you, Simon. The hot water you requested, Your Majesty. I need a heating pad and a paint roller with a good handle. Of course, straight away. I have a heating pad and good luck with the roller. Is there anything we can do to help? I am charged with finding a paint roller in a palace. I possess such an item. - Really? - You do? With a good handle? A very excellent handle, yes. And may I ask why? No, you may not, Andrew. Come, Mr. Z. - We will get it. - Thank you. Help! Please help us! Help! It's no use, darling, no one can hear us. Look, a key! It's too far. That's really helping. How long did you volunteer at the hospital? - Many years. - You certainly learned a lot. I learned no job is more demanding or rewarding than motherhood. Penglia now has services in place to assist and support all of our mothers in any way they might need. I heard about that program, it's fantastic. I'm trying to implement something similar here, with a few updates. You're so close. That's it, almost. You have it, you've got it. You got it! There you are. Good girl. Almost there. Lift it up. Oh! Emily! Emily, are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. - The stone didn't hurt you? Look, in there. - I can't believe it. - The missing treaty. What was that? The ghost, coming to get the treaty. No, listen. It's the wind blowing through the stones. So, no ghost? No. But we have the treaty. But we're still locked in. - Amber. - Richard. - How are you? - No baby yet. Everything's going to be fine, Your Majesty. How far apart are the surges? Five minutes, progressing steadily. Ah. Thank you for being so attentive. It's useless. It's nearly midnight. It's over. We mustn't give up. But what can we do? This. Brilliant, Mother. The linens, doctor. What time is it? Ten minutes to midnight. Where are they? The treaty, we found the treaty. What? Where? In the dungeon. How did you know? Amber solved the mystery. I did. Come in, everyone. You all need to hear this. Someone right here, in this very room, stole the treaty. Tell us everything you know. The scandal that followed the signing of the treaty resulted in the alleged poisoning of Prince Claude. His family swore vengeance and a member of that family is in this room. Go on. Prince Claude's family name, Devon, was familiar to me and tonight I remembered why. I read it in this book. Your mother's maiden name was Devin. Wasn't it, Mr. Little? I know it was you, Mr. Little. You were the last one to lock up the treaty, you kept the dog out of the dungeon and you tried to keep Emily out of the dungeon with some made-up ghost story. If you're guilty, Mr. Little, confess here and now. I did do it. To break the truce and sever our ties with Penglia. But why? I was bound by a solemn blood oath, a sworn duty to avenge the crime against my family by the Penglian Prince Jun. Mr. Little, Prince Jun's guilt was never proven. Our historians believe that the real culprit was a covetous feudal lord. I had a duty. I fulfilled it. You nearly started a war. And could have cursed an innocent baby. I didn't know about the curse until tonight. And I would never bring harm to your baby. - Mr. Zabala. - Ma'am? Take Mr. Little to the Leopold Suite. At once. Simon, I apologize for my behavior earlier. Did you think... We had our suspicions. Not you, too! Lynn and I have been working diligently on economic amendments to the treaty which should benefit both kingdoms. And we've found a very promising solution. That's all it was, I promise. What is it? When I came to your room last night after Lynn left, you hid something. How can that relate to the treaty? It didn't. Lynn was helping to make sure I chose well when picking out the most important gift I'll offer you. I wanted to wait until tomorrow, but... Melissa, my love... Although I'm undeserving of such an honor, will you marry me? Yes! Yes. Yes! Congratulations. Congratulations, Simon. Congratulations, Melissa. You could have done worse. Oh, that's a ringing endorsement. Don't let it get to your head. I see a royal title in your future, Simon. Perhaps Duke? I accept. This is such wonderful news. I'm so happy for you. But we're running out of time. It's nearly midnight and there's a treaty to sign. - Quickly. - Yes. We must allow the time for the Queens to sign as well. There's always time to make history. But not too much time. Your Majesty, King Tai. The visiting monarch signs first. After you, my Queen. You have made me and all of Penglia very proud. At the hour of 11:59, on December the 24th in the year 2019, I declare the truce and treaty between the kingdoms of Aldovia and Penglia executed, ratified and renewed for the next 100 years. We made it. Merry Christmas. Happy anniversary. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Mrs. Averill. I think it's time. Everyone except the father, out. The royal baby is ready to make its entrance. Okay. - Yes. - Thank you. Okay. Congratulations. A healthy, beautiful baby. Thank goodness. Well done, Amber. Queen Amber, King Richard, may I present to you the future monarch of Aldovia, your daughter. Oh... Hi. She's beautiful. She's incredible. Just like her mother. Thank you. Amber and I are the proud parents... of a new... baby girl. I knew it was a girl. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Your father would be overjoyed if he were here. Mr. Zabala, champagne for the baby girl! Girl? Did I just hear I have a granddaughter? Merry Christmas, everyone. I fought my way onto the first flight. You're just in time to meet her. Mother, Rudy. Pop, you made it. How's my little peanut? Never better. Meet your granddaughter, Elleri. You named her after mom. Elleri. You're perfect. - Here. - Ooh! Come to grandpa. She likes you. Yeah. Elleri. Such a beautiful name. Beautiful baby. Congratulations. The plane is standing by. We can be back in Penglia by sunrise to enjoy Christmas with your children. Go home, be with your family. And Ming... thank you for everything. Thank you. Call me anytime. Even better, bring your little one for a visit. We can discuss our programs for mothers in person. I'd love to. King Richard, it's been an adventure. A Penglian symbol of mother's nurturing strength. It's yours now. Are you sure? Queen Amber of Aldovia, you are going to be a wonderful mother. Thank you. Today, her Royal Highness, Queen Amber of Aldovia, safely delivered a daughter, Princess Elleri Claire Charlton. Merry Christmas! Beautiful! Come on, Princess! Bravo! Congratulations. I love our princess. So do I. I love you. I want to thank you all, my loyal readers, for sharing this amazing journey with me. I couldn't be more grateful. On behalf of Richard, myself, Elleri and the Royal family of Aldovia, we wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. ‚ô™ It only happens once a year ‚ô™ ‚ô™ When we can spread Some Christmas cheer ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Been waiting for the season ‚ô™ ‚ô™ To celebrate that feeling Of holiday magic in the air ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 'Cause ooh, ooh, I get happy ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And ooh, ooh, I spread some joy ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And everywhere we go We share the love we know ‚ô™ ‚ô™ It is a feeling you can't compare Of the magic in the air ‚ô™ ‚ô™ We can see the Northern Lights Sparkling across the sky ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Sleigh bells in the snow, Kiss underneath the mistletoe ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If I only had one wish ‚ô™ ‚ô™ It would be the gift Of spreading love, love, love, love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ At Christmas ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 'Cause ooh, ooh, I get happy ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And ooh, ooh, I spread some joy ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And everywhere we go We share the love we know ‚ô™ ‚ô™ It is a feeling you can't compare Of the magic in the air ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If I only had one wish ‚ô™ ‚ô™ It would be the gift Of spreading love, love, love, love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ At Christmas ‚ô™
