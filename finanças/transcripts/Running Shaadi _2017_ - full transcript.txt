Encoded by mAck | @ mAck Encodes | Quick-fix. In Punjab, there's a quick-fix for every problem. Coming to the problem... The biggest problem amongst youngsters these days is getting married according to their will. But there's a quick-fix for that too. A website... and it's called Running Shaadi. Love marriage only lasts for a couple of months. Soon after they get fed up, file for divorce. It's not advisable. It's spoiling the society. Parents always do the right thing. It's upsetting the apple cart. No, no. Running away and getting married isn't right. Why would anyone want to run away and get married? Because their parents aren't allowing them or there are problems in the society, like caste and creed problems. So I feel Running Shaadi is a good thing. At least they understand our problems. Parents will never agree. So, we'll have to run away and get married. If someone wants to run away, they will run away. So why not do it in a systematic way. This is exactly why Running Shaadi was created. It's a great site. I'll use it if I have to. Have you lost your mind? Don't you understand what I am trying to say? Don't worry about the price, madam. We'll give you a good deal. Just choose one. Their entire wedding was ruined! The driver didn't know the way. Nimmi, come here. What kind of skirt are you wearing? Is this the way to go to school? -Chotu. -Yes. Take her to the tailor and ask him to stitch a longer skirt for her. Yes. Uncle is in a really bad mood today. He even gave a hard time to Tanny brother. What's wrong with you? That Jobanmeet Bajaj. Did he tease you? He proposed to me on Valentine's Day. I went on a date with him. I... -I missed my period. -Cover it up in the tuitions. We had sex! You're still too young to be doing that. -But I-- -You're still in school! Listen... Listen, please... If my father finds out, I'll get in big trouble. Please do something. Please. What? We're supposed to go play a match on behalf of the school. We leave in the morning and come back the next day. How many weeks has it been? Ten. I don't understand, what do you boys have against condoms! There's something. Because the winds have changed There's something Because I can feel a restlessness So Nimmi, which course did you finally choose? English Honors. It's got the most amazing crowd. Life is smiling The paths are tranquil The dawn and dusk Are meeting over the horizon Something's definitely special Get down here. I'll go from here. -I'll drop you. -No, only students are allowed inside. Please stay, don't go Don't let me spend my evenings alone Please stay, don't go Don't let me spend my evenings alone What is life trying to convey? These moments are going away My desires are scattered And I'm trying to count my blessings You're obsessed. You keep calling me every minute. When I call, you goddamned pick up. What do you want from me? -You want me to sit on your lap all day? -I... Don't I have friends, don't I have a life? -I just want to know who I am. -What? -Exactly, who am I? -What? -Yes, what? -Let me tell you what you are. You're an illiterate idiot, that's what you are. I think we should remain just friends. That we already are. Fine, then let's stay that way. Fine! -Kartar. -Yes, brother. Did you deliver Mrs. Dhillon's order? It's ready. -Are you okay? -Absolutely fine. -It's my birthday tomorrow. -I know. Dad's throwing a party at Kings Retreat tomorrow. I know. Are you coming? Are you asking me or inviting me? It's an invitation. You must come. I'll be waiting for you. -Chotu. -Uncle. Where were you? There's so much to do. Hey, mister, you wanted sauce and ajinamoto, didn't you? Chotu... I don't know what I was thinking. I forgot to pickup the cake. Excuse me, we had ordered for a cake. -Is this the one? -Yes, that's the one. The catering guys didn't arrange for ice. Uncle's screwing me for the goof-up. Nimmi. Happy birthday. -Finally, you found time to come. -I... I... Nimmi, come on, it's your birthday party. What are you doing? -Just a minute, I'll-- -Everyone's waiting. What's wrong with you? Come on. Yes? -Greetings, uncle. -What is the matter? Remember that girl from Patna you spoke to me about. -If she's still interested... -Then? It's a yes from me. I'm hanging up now, talk to you later. Bye. Why are you calling me? You guys mess up everything and I have to face the music! Mrs. Dhillon's been calling me. This is not my job, get it? Do you know to do your job or not? What the hell are you doing out there? Stop arguing and hang up. The embroidery is just pathetic. Even the delivery isn't on time. This isn't the first time we got it done from you. Your earlier work was impeccable. What happened now? It's such a shabby job! This is not even wearable. I'll call Ratni. How much is it going to be? You guys don't do your job and I get blamed for it! Call the guy and tell him to take his stuff back. -What is this? -You tell me uncle what's going on here. You appointed a stupid supervisor for quality control. And cheap workers at half the rate are not doing their job. The order was bound to get rejected. How did the order get rejected? Were you sleeping? This is your responsibility. What are you saying, uncle? What responsibility? Even you know that you do what you like. What are you saying? There's no planning at all. No one knows what to do. I wonder how you're still in business. -Nothing is happening. -What planning-- You couldn't even organize a birthday party properly. -Birthday party? -Of course. What about the birthday party? -Why not? -What was the problem in the party? What was your plan? You employed a stupid caterer only to save a few bucks. It was your daughter's birthday after all. You could've celebrated grandly by spending a bit more. But you had to be such a miser. Everything was fine. Everyone enjoyed. You guys were enjoying, because I was slogging like a donkey until midnight. Get it. It was 1:00 a.m. I brought the slab of ice at 1:00 a.m. while you were drunk and dancing. If I don't enjoy, then who else will? You? Just because I give you a little credit, you think you're my boss now. If I hadn't picked you up from the streets, then you would've been out slogging driving a rickshaw. Get back to your work. I said go. We'll discuss this at lunch-time, there are customers now-- Shut up! I said go. If Singh 'N' Singh can do without me, then even I can do without Singh 'N' Singh. Then do it. After working hard for so long, he says drive a rickshaw. Did I come here to drive a rickshaw? Whatever happened was for your own good. What was good about it? What could you have possibly achieved in Singh 'N' Singh? You think he would've made you his son-in-law? You were treating them more like family. This is exactly why I asked you to join me two years ago. But you were so loyal to him. "They're like family." Now you've to pay. Try to understand, son. It's a small city. Everyone knows everyone here. And if Ratni Uncle isn't positive about you, then no one will be willing to support you in this market. That's fine, uncle, but why did you have to say all that? You see son, that Sinha... He was making such tall claims about his daughter. And I didn't exactly lie to him. I just told him the truth. After all, my nephew works in Amritsar, Punjab. So, what date did you fix? The date is nine months later, -when she turns 18. -Eighteen? There should be a decent gap in the age, for things to go smooth. You know what, just add the girl on Facebook and send her romantic messages. -Understand? -Okay, uncle. This hand too... Okay, I must take care of your cousin now. He's messing things up. I mean... -You must show this-- -Show what? -You couldn't shoot a small-- -Just one spoon at night, and everything will be clear in the morning. All clear in the morning. -Cut it! -Constipation relieved. Stomach cleared! Just one pill at night and all clear in the morning. Cut! Cut. Very nice. Hey, empty-hard disk. Why is that guy from Patna giving you his girl? Don't they prefer IAS guys. Now you're screwing with me too. I am hungry, let's go eat. There's a wedding, would you like to come? -Whose? -What do you care? It's a non-veg party. Free meal for us. Isn't that guy from Patna giving you a car or something? I don't want anything. What's your fetish with Russian salad? I'll go get us a soft-drink. So finally you got the time to call back. I was a little busy? Of course, I know where you've been busy. You just got your wedding fixed. Well, I can't be taking your permission for everything. Show me her picture? I hope we're still friends. If you ever need anything... call me. Take care. What? Ran away! How did she run away? How did she run away? I have invited over thousand guests. And you're telling me she ran away. Stop... Stop the music! Don't just stand there, go find her! Go! She shouldn't have run away so soon. She did the right thing. At least she had the courage to keep her commitment. Her guts made me miss my Russian salad. Come on! Get down! Who do you think you are? Why are they bashing him up? Wait... How dare try to elope with the girl? You don't need to get involved. They were so close. If only they had planned this out, they could've run away and got married. Well, the mind doesn't think straight in such situations. It's totally screwed. How will they plan it out? Well, see you in the morning. Cyber... listen... What was the name of that Windows guy? Actually, he's still around. Bill Gates. I have a really great idea, like he did. Remember last night's incident? If someone had provided a quick-fix or planned for that boy and girl, then... Then what? They could've eloped successfully and got married. Meaning? Meaning we provide a kind of a service for those who want to run away and get married. Then all the problems will be solved. Dot com! Look, I have been thinking about building a website like Facebook. Let's combine both the ideas, and make a website. People make websites for arranged marriage. We'll make one for running marriages. RunningShaadi. Give me your card. Card. My card got stuck in the ATM last night. Forget this ego. Go and meet him once. -What are you doing here? -It's my father's shop. But what are you doing here? Trying to call Tanny, but he isn't answering. Papa sent him to Jalandhar for some work. What is it? I want to buy something from the internet, I just needed his credit card. -Buy from the internet? -Yes, so? -You? -So? I am sure you can. After all, even you have 14 friends on Facebook now. -Take my card. -How can I take your card? Do you want it or not? What mess are you two are getting into now? What website is this? -Mind your own business. -Shut your mouth. Will you be quiet? Done? -You should say thank you. -Welcome not. It's Bhangara-night (dance night) in my college tonight. Would you come? What will I do there? You'll be busy with your friends. Fine. I'll go with Shunty instead. He's been chasing me for a long time now. Bye. Dance nights with Shunty. What do you care? Make the website. But first we must know how will we help them elope? I had to cancel my afternoon date with Shunty for you. Even we took a big risk for you in the Jobanmeet case. Shut your mouth and mind your own business. Control him. Even if you don't take a bath, -at least use a deodorant. -She's right. What's this now? It's for our safety. Aunt Neetu has seen me many times at the shop. What if she recognizes me? Start. Doesn't matter if it's 2013 or 2063, parents never change. Take Nimmi for instance. Do you know her dad? He's not going to ask for her advice for her marriage. Ratni's going to think that he's the only smart guy around. And that's why these lovers run away and get married. You know, Sweety and Ashu from Sandhu colony, their's was an internet case. From chatting on Facebook, we moved on to Skyping each other. And without even a single meeting, we knew we were made for each other. -But our parents were old-fashioned. -We were from different caste. And so, we went to the Gurdwara in Ambala, spoke with the priest and got married. Later, the priest gave us a certificate and we got the marriage registered. So how did your family react to it? Tell us... How do you think the family was going to react? They sent Raje Mama after us. The local gangster. And he troubled us a lot. He was insane. Chased us all over! -Your sister-in-law is from Himachal. -I see. -Yes, yes. -And I am from Punjab. So that's an inter-state and inter-caste problem. But we booked our marriage under the Special Marriage Act. The lawyers do the maximum job. If you can find decent lawyer, he gets the job done for you. Who's it going to be? -How about him? -He looks more like the bad guy. Definitely not him. Let's keep looking. Is the guy local or NRI? -He's local. -And the girl? You might say she's local too. Well then, let's just say she's local then. You see, local's easier. Lasts longer, you see. Tell us the procedure. Just get me the age proof for the girl and boy. Along with their photos and two witnesses who should be their relatives as well. That's all. What if they don't have relatives? No problem. What are we here for? We'll get the witnesses. But... it will cost you extra. Brother, what's the Special Marriage Act? Special Marriage Act is an act made by the Parliament of India, according to which any girl of caste, creed and color, can marry any boy of any caste, creed and color. It is a very Orthodox and ortho-modular law, made by the parliament of India. Sanctioned by Parliament of India. I mean to say, for those special cases. He looks greedy, he'll definitely say yes. -Brother... -Yes. What's the matter? That is a big matter, it's a really big matter, brother. Tell me something, brother. How many cases do you get every day? Summing up an average is difficult. But I do see the judge twice a week. What if we make you see him every day? Every day? You get an average of two to three cases. How do you survive with that? Who says it's enough to survive. It's barely enough to afford one square meal. Exactly our point. We'll make sure that you can't just afford full square meals, but throw in a feast every day. In fact, we'll make sure sister-in-law enjoys it too. Don't drag her into this! It's a very touchy issue, I am warning you. I won't do your job. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? You just have to get us earlier dates under the Special Marriage Act. -And some priority. -Yes. Fine... Deal... done! Take their blessings first. We're no less than Mark Zuckerburg ourselves now. What now? Wait for people to upload their profile. But how will the people know about our site? Hey, intelligent couples... Whenever there's a sale at shop Papa would go to that Popular Press guy, for printing the pamphlets. Yeah, I know. I would take the design to him. So do just that. -She's right. -I am always right by default, you fool. Well, see you. It's Shunty's birthday. Best of luck for your ventures. She's got only one thing on her mind. "Shunty! Shunty! Shunty! Shunty!" You've got work to do, don't you? So stop doing Shunty! Shunty! Shunty! Shunty! Happy birthday to you.

Shonku is the most brainiest person I have ever known, okay. -Stop racking your brain. -Good mental, good mental. -It's a good thing. -Well, madam, tell me why does your family have a problem with such a brainy guy? I don't know what allergy does mom have against Bengalis. But I have made it clear, I am not going to marry any NRI. -That was wrong. -What? Look, first go home, and patch up with your family. And assure them, that you're ready to marry the NRI. And then from tomorrow morning, start jogging. -Jogging? -Yes, jogging. From tomorrow, every morning at 7:00 a.m. you must go jogging in the park near your home. Your parents will think that you're trying to get healthy for the wedding. Preparing yourself.

Bravo, bravo, come on. Do it. A round of applause everyone. Have sweets. Eat it. He who utters the name of Guru, victory is his. We've a new problem. Some Simran, who wants a musical nite before she runs away. Stupid. These things are very important for girls. They are right to demand for a Bollywood style musical nite. What to do? Stop staring at me. The biggest problem amongst youngsters these days is getting married according to their will. But there's a quick-fix for that too. A website, and it's called RunningShaadi. Welcome to our studio. -Hello. -Hello. My first question, why a website? You see, we never think why, we think why not. Marriage is a huge business in our country. There's already a number of matrimonial websites. This could be the only new variation in matrimony. RunningShaadi. The youngsters are very happy with this website. At least they understand our problems. Parents will never agree. So we'll have to run away and get married. If someone wants to run away, they will run away. So why not do it in a systematic manner. But elders, they are not very happy. It's not advisable. It's spoiling the society. No, no, running away and getting married isn't right. Get me some water. And some fritters. Hello, sir. -Password? -Sukhi31. Hello. So it was you guys who helped Jaspreet elope? Jaspreet Dhillon? Yes. I guess she referred you to us. She is my sister. Lucky, come out, guys. -Brother... -Run. Take off their caps. Let's see who they are. Police. Little. Little, wake up. Wake up. What happened? -There's a big problem. -What happened? Remember that lady doctor from the Jobanmeet matter? The stupid wretch came to my shop. Madam, she's my daughter. -Your daughter? -Yes. She told dad everything. My dad lost his mind. There's some Gurwinder Bhatti and he's fixed my marriage with him. I don't want to marry him. What do you want to do? -Love marriage? -With whom? With you. Stop joking with me in the morning. Yes, I was joking. Who's going to marry you, stupid? Have you seen your face? I want to marry Shunty. -Shunty? -Yes. You two have come this far, you didn't tell me. You want me to take your permission for everything. It's not about permission. Your love's always too instant. I can see that Jobanmeet matter repeating again. Stop lecturing me now. Then why did you come here? To invite me to your wedding? Shunty is Tejpal uncle's son. Great. Then uncle will definitely get you two married. How intelligent! That's exactly why I came asking for your help. -What can I do? -RunningShaadi. Help me run away. Are you crazy? What can I do? Stop behaving like that. Didn't I help you out? Try to understand, I can't do this. Uncle will think I am just taking revenge. And your brother, he's my friend. Don't get me involved in this mess, get it? I don't get all this. You're worried about uncle and my brother. And I am trouble? Great. Nimmi, try to understand. I understand. Fine. -Listen... -What? Even you ended up using me. Fine, I understand. It's okay. I'll handle it. But, yes. Do me a favor. Don't tell Tanny anything. Can you do that much? Thank you. That girl is like a virus in your life. Don't be a fool. Don't let this fan the fire between Uncle and you. And isn't Tanny your friend? You want to help her sister elope? You're a weird guy. And what about your own wedding? You're supposed to leave for Patna in two weeks. Don't get in to this mess. Dad misses you too. You should meet him once before you go. It'll be the right thing to do. Tell me more. How can you think like that, Nimmi? Just quietly marry whoever your father wants you to. You'll automatically fall in love. Stop lecturing me on love. You said yes to that Bihari girl out of desperation. And now you're advising me. I wasn't desperate. I just didn't see a future with you, so I quietly moved on. Fine, so let me move on too. I asked for a small favor, and you couldn't do that either. -Tanny is like a brother. -Am I your enemy? No attachment with me? That's exactly why I am trying to explain you. You just recently met that guy. Get to know him first. -You're being hasty. -How can you say I don't know Shunty? You want to know? -Have you met him? -I don't want to meet him, -you're the one getting married. -But you're going to help me elope. Let's meet him. Meet him once. Now you're forcing me. -Come on. -But-- Let's go meet him. He's here. Hi, baby. Hi. Myself Daljeet Kapoor, also known as Shunty. I have told him everything about you. Don't let us down. We want to elope day after tomorrow. But where will you go? We'll settle down in Delhi. He's already got a job in an MNC. And tomorrow is his induction. He's an MBA. Fine, I... -I'll do something. -Thanks. Really appreciate it. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Sure? Thank you. Didn't I tell you he'll help us? Even I am marrying someone else, right? So even she has a right, to move on in life. Right. Martyred lovers look good only in cinema, in real life they are called assholes. Fine, then I am an asshole. -Asshole. -I am a big asshole. Now what? You're a bigger asshole. Hey, asshole. So, when does she want to elope? Speak up. Leave for Ambala tomorrow. Why Ambala? It's just too risky out here. There's a court right next to the Gurdrawa. We'll get their marriage registered there. Shunty has some introduction in Delhi, he'll come directly. And your virus Nimmi... I am sure her father is keeping a strict watch on her. How do we get her out? Hey... Where? Hen-party. What's a hen-party? Just like boys have a bachelor party before their wedding. This one's for the girls. -Like a bachelors party. -We don't want any party. Please, uncle. -Please, uncle. -She will go to Ludhiana. Please, uncle, we won't get another chance. If you want to party, then do it here. No, no, no, uncle, it's not that. It's a girls party, just us only. Please, uncle, please, let us go. -Tanny. -Yeah? Go with them. Tanny? Uncle, what will he do with us? It's a girls party, yeah, please. No Tanny, no party. -Fine. -Come, Tanny. Am I going to sit on your lap? Tanny, let it be. What will you do amongst girls? Pick me up in the morning from Arshi's home. Papa asked me to keep a watch on you. You don't trust me either. Isn't that it? Great. Papa will screw me over, try to understand. I only have two days, after that I'll go away. Let me have some fun. Please, brother. Can't you do this much for your sister? I'll pick you up at 7:00 a.m. Fine. -Go. -Thank you. Go carefully. Bye. Bye. Be careful. Thanks, thanks. And, call me as soon as you get there. Couldn't you park a little further? But I told you, I'll be sitting in a red i10 car outside Avtaar Singh's flourmill. They all look the same to me in the dark. -What if someone had seen me? -But no one did. Are you waiting for someone to see me? Let's go. You're with RunningShaadi, I am eloping you. -We are fool-proof. -Shut up and drive. Let's get a beer on the way, stress-buster. Are you crazy? We're gonna drink a beer now? Only crazy people drink beer? Weird. Did you run away to get married or to have fun? It's not every day that I run away from home. Let's enjoy all the way. -Well, consider it a party from me. -Great. We'll reach drunk at the venue and scare your groom away. Shunty isn't like you, he's broadminded. Fine, I am taking you to him. Did you wash your hands? Always wash your hands after peeing, Little. Learn some good manners. Rascal. What are you doing, Ratni? Slapping your son. I asked him to keep a watch on her. How did she run away? Nothing, the client's demand is to eat first. And we cannot refuse the client. It's the consequence of taking up a glutton like her. Stop blabbering. -Is everything set out there? -Yeah. Everything's set here, but your brother-in-love Shunty's phone is switched off. He'll get there directly. Keep trying. And stop stuffing your face with those fritters. -How did you know? -Hang up. Nimmi, Shunty isn't answering his phone. He's got his Accounts exam today. What kind of exam after a job? Shunty is my senior in college. And he put up this charade for me. Meaning? Meaning, I wanted to elope with you, stupid. You're joking, right? Fine, I admit my mistake. I got too carried away by my college friends. You were right. But you know how they are? -Are you mad? -You lost your mind. And you fixed your marriage with that Bihari girl. As a result, even I made up a fake story about Shunty. I thought I'll make you jealous. I'll go with Shunty. I had to cancel my date with Shunty. It's Shunty's birthday. Tell me something, you think I am crazy to be running around with cards and pamphlets of your Running Shaadi. Don't I have better things to do? I thought I'll spend some time with you. Maybe you'll learn some sense and cancel your wedding. But you turned out to be more stubborn than me. Well, if I didn't have big ego, I would've apologized myself. Then why didn't you? Why put up this charade? I did. -Love marriage. -With whom? You. Did you see your reaction? See your face? It was a complete turn off. And I made up that Shunty story. You've lost your mind? Why are you being so emotional? Chill. The plan still remains the same. We'll go to the Gurdwara and get married. And then the registry. All set. Don't worry. Great, all set. What a great plan you made. How will I face uncle? What about uncle? He must know by now. I left a letter before running away. I wrote "I am running away with Bharose and getting married." Look, Little, I cannot go back now. Father is so dumb. Why will I answer his calls now? And you're so smart, aren't you? You couldn't think of a better idea. I don't understand why you're getting so emotional. You should be happy. I went through so much trouble for you. Actually, it's bigger than you think. And the timing is even worse. It's a feeling. It doesn't give you a warning before it comes. Yeah, great. Only you have all the feelings, don't you? Are you even aware of the consequences? Where are you? I don't care. Sit at the airport and check who's coming and going. The actual root of this mess is Youtube. Great, man. Uncle will have to change the name of his shop, from Singh 'N' Singh to Singh 'N' Bharose. Let it be. That's never going to happen. Your friend is a sissy. If only my father was the programmer at ETC Punjabi, he would've definitely married me. What's ETC got to do with this? Shut up! -You don't get it, do you? -No, I don't. I wasn't ready for such a big mess. I have a commitment in Patna, you know that. Fine, go. Go marry that illiterate Bihari. She's fit for you. -Fine. -Great. -Fine, go then. Go! -Fine. Relax, lovers. Tell me clearly, do you guys want to get married or not? The priests are waiting. No one's getting married. Call your home now and tell them everything you did. Shut your mouth, you fool, and lower your voice! I am not calling anyone. -Hello. -Hello, mom. What's all this charade, dear? -Where are you? -What difference does it make? Let's not get into details. I am coming back. No, no, no, don't come back right now. Papa and Tanny are in an awful mood. I suggest that you two go to Aunt Neetu's airport manor. Stay there tonight. I will try to convince your father. I'll wait outside. Nimmi... Nimmi, I... Best of luck for your commitment, Bharose. Me? -Where will you go now? -Home! Are you crazy? If anyone spots you in the city, they will beat you to a pulp. -You two stay here tonight. -It's all right, we'll manage. Hey, management, you've nothing to lose, but he'll get into deep shit. Stay here tonight. -Think of something in the morning. -I'll tell him. Let's stay. It's safe here today. We'll think of something tomorrow morning. Nimmi, are you okay? Thank God. How are you, son? Come, come in. Give me the car keys. I left my moisturizer inside. Like I said, she's the virus in your life. I am leaving here. What more can I do? Fine. Happy, look. Run, Bharose, run. -Nimmi, give me the key. -What? Catch him. Come on, hurry! Keep looking. There... Come on, let's go. Look behind. I think we left them behind. -I think we're safe. -What safe? I told Nimmi this plan won't work. Shit! I told you don't be a stupid lover. We're in big trouble now. Nimmi, come out. You'll get me killed too. She's been shot! Nimmi. Nimmi. Shit! Get in the car. Get in the car, quick. Go, go, get the doctor! Was it one of those Haryana Roadways bus? -Yes. -They drive pretty rashly. Is it serious? Some glass pieces were lodged in the shoulder. She bled a lot, so she will have fever for few days. How many bullets? Sorry, man. I was worried. Try to keep calm. Yes. The differential's been damaged as well. Nothing serious. Tanny. Inspector. Shit, I wonder why they had to involve the local goon. Let's get out of here. This way, come on. Mister. Nimmi, eat something. You've to take your medicines. There's a bus that leaves for Dalhousie in ten minutes. What to do? I want to run away with you I want you to always be in my destiny The hearts set out on the path of love O Sun, illuminate my path I will patch these bonds That are separate You will find me always Standing behind you If you feel cold I'll shield you with my warmth I feel lost along with you I want you to always be in my destiny What dwells in my soul is your love Like the sun Sailing in a boat over the river Don't waste your luminance Your sorrows are a burden to me My heart wants to keep beating for you I want to run away along with you I want you to always be in my destiny The hearts set out on the path of love O Sun, illuminate my path The fire that burns in our bodies Is also fragrant like love My tresses are drenched And the drops are like fire I can spend a lifetime like this With you, I feel complete Even the dust in my hands Turned to vermillion I want to run away along with you I want you to always be in my destiny The hearts set out on the path of love O Sun, illuminate my path I will patch the bonds that have withered Where are your manners? Sorry for disturbing your activities. But I just saw Raje mama and his gang in the market. He was showing your photos in every shop and inquiring. Sorry, man. I... I uploaded pictures of Dalhousie on Facebook. Sorry. Now, we'll have to run from here too. How long will I keep running with my Nimmi? My Nimmi. Rascal, you're marrying one and running away with another. What do you want? Right now, I want everyone's safety. We can get safety in Laloo's country. -Patna? -Yeah. It's a stupid idea. You know his wedding's been fixed. But that's his area. No one can touch him out there. That's a fact. And will you take me there as your wedding guest? Nimmi... I... I'll think of something. Stop, stop, stop here. Uncle. Bharose. -How are you? -Just fine. You were supposed to come after a week. You could've at least informed me. Doesn't matter. Mukundi would've picked you from the station. Well, I wrapped up work soon, so I came early. Nimmi. Cyber. She's Cyber's sister. -Brother and sister? -Yes. Very nice. -I am heading to the studio? -Are you shooting something? I am making an ad for phenyl. Cockroach Clean Phenyl. Fine, uncle, you leave, we'll take a nap. See you in the evening. Why evening? Come in the afternoon, we'll have lunch together. -Fine, then I'll freshen up. -Take a bath? No, no, no, it's okay. Of course we will, we'll take a bath. It was a long journey, we'll take a bath. Isn't there any water? Of course there's water. The geyser's working too. But it blows up after 10-12 minutes. Fill up a bucket and use that for bathing. Uncle, you're just... I am waiting there, okay? Nice. Get some rest, enjoy. Should I give it a push? -Push? -Yes. You're still hogging this piece of junk. Why don't you buy a new one? I will, this is just for now. I just fueled her up. It's runs really smooth. Just watch it sail smoothly. Yes... yes... yes... Bravo... Bharose... thank you. Ujala Babu. Ujala Babu.

Brother-in-law, when did you arrive? You were supposed to come after four days. -Well, work finished early, so... -But, this is not done. We would've come to pick you up, with special arrangements. Sit, sit. Calm down. -How about some water? -This is bad. You should've informed me before. -Water? -Yes, yes, water. Give me some water. I can't believe it. Nimmi, stay inside. -Water? -Yes. Who is the lady? She's my friend's sister, here to attend my wedding. -Any problem? -No, no. -Any objection? -No. My friends can attend my wedding, can't they? What's to object? I'm just see a new face, that's why I am telling you. No big deal. I came to tell you, that the DJ... -Mithilesh? -Yeah, Mithilesh... He's just awesome. When he plays his music, even the dead start dancing. -That's how good he is. -Is he? Yeah. I'll get you something to eat, wait. I won't eat. I want you, your family. along with your friends to come over for a meal. Why friends? It's a family matter. We'll come. Your friends will come, we'll get to know each other. We'll maintain a relation with her. If uncle finds out, he'll say why I didn't invite them too. -Okay? -Okay, I get it. -I'll get them too. -You get it. Can I leave now? -With your permission? -Of course. Okay. I am so happy to see you. Great. Do come. -Okay. -See you. Savita, when I say action pour a capful in the bucket. This phenyl company, hasn't paid me for my last four ad campaigns. His phenyl isn't selling and he blames my ads for it. But that's not my fault. Back home you would drink even ground water and out here you want mineral water. Go sit in the cow-shed. What's your scene with that girl? -What girl? -That girl who came here with you. -Nothing. -Did you two do it already? -What are you saying, uncle? Why would-- -No, even if you did, just leave her. I don't know you. Mistakes happen. Soon you'll get married, son. Right? Take care. Uncle... I have submitted a pilot episode in DD Patna. Now it's in Sinha sir's hands. But you're in my hand, aren't you? Your aunt has made a heavy investment for the Pilot. Look at that, you're piling on weight. You won't be able to work properly. Look at your aunt. How she's cutting corners on the Unit member's lunch. You two are brothers, right. Eat together, come on. Uncle... I... -I have a doubt about Neha. -What? What doubt? She is a very beautiful, gentle lady. I knew it right away, that she is made for you. Only. Think only about Neha, otherwise the entire family will be out on the street. I beg you. How are you? Yeah, I'm fine. Swine. Never pays on time. Just act smart. See the guy in the black coat? I am sure he alone drinks up all of the phenyl. Nothing must be left for the company. I'll go meet the swine. Yes, I'm coming. You wait here till then, I'll be back. Have your tea. Yeah, sir, I am waiting for you. You're looking a little weak. You didn't tell your uncle, yet. Speak softly, he'll hear you. It's a very complicated matter. Muktiyar, this will go in "the Very Big Mess" package. Are you taking me along to be a part of your happiness? Try to understand. If you don't come, they will ask me couple of more questions. Let's go, please. Tell you what, you pay for everything now. We'll settle the accounts when we get back. Do what you want? Just don't go get married to that girl. Next, you'll see me dancing in your wedding. Is she coming along... that girl, Nimmi and that boy, her brother? Why are you so interested? I am not. The more the people, the better the impression. Let's cheers. Come on. Now that way, this way. You're gonna bump someone. I am driving an ambassador, it's not a joke.

Hello, Nimmi. Come in, please. Nimmi, help yourself with the sweets. Nimmi, it's special sweet, please. Slowly. Now that's called love. He's my nephew, but I have always treated him like a son. After all, he's my sister's son. Great. Well, I think the boy and girl should meet now. Dear, if she's finished decking up, then call her out. -Look, here she is. -There she is. -She's here. -Very nice. Seems like an angel descending from heaven. Take blessings, dear. Go on. -Take your shoes off. -It's all right. -Bless you, dear. -Take your shoes off. -Bless her properly. -It's done. We're modern people, we don't believe in these things. They are modern too. Let Neha sit there. Sitting there like an ox. -Whose son is that? -I told you, he's... -It's their family matter. -There's a history behind it. I'll tell you some other time. You're being shy, how does she look? It's their first marriage, after all. Just beautiful. Who chose her after all? She's my choice. -And Neha sings so well. -Yeah. She sings almost like a nightingale. Come on, sing a song. What would you prefer? -Classical, folk, western-- -Modern. -Sing a modern song, dear. -Yes. Dear, sing a modern song for them. Artists always need freedom. Artists always need freedom. Go ahead, sing. Sing. I'll play and you sing. Come on, start. One-two-three-four Get on the dance floor Bum-shake...

There's a big garden up ahead. Just go take a look. Go on, son. He's a bit shy. Go, talk openly about everything. Tell him about your education too. -Send two cups of tea for the children. -Yes. One-two-three-four Get on the dance floor Bum-shake... Bum-shake Neha's so talented, isn't she? I am really confused. Is she better or her? Even I am confused, should I slap you, or give you a whack? You're jealous, that's all. I am not jealous at all. You guys don't know anything. Did you see her face? She was sad. She's right, something's wrong. That Sinha looks over-exited and his daughter doesn't even talk to me. See. Let's investigate this case. Let's find out everything, like where she goes, when and who she goes out with. RunningShaadi investigation. What a foolish lover Doesn't know the rules of love My crazy beloved always so restless Never listens to me What a foolish lover Doesn't know the rules of love My crazy beloved always so restless Never listens to me What do I say to Lord He sent me a Romeo without brains He looks naïve But he's a complete a devil Gone. She will take at least a couple of hours. She takes so long. She needs it. How about a cup of tea? Come. At least her brothers aren't standing guard anymore. -They are bored too. -Yeah. I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo Now I am in trouble I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo Now I am in trouble Everything he says is meaningless But makes such tall claims No shame at all He robs in daylight Everything he says is meaningless But makes such tall claims No shame at all He robs in daylight Keeps ogling at me In front of my parents Pours his heart out on me In the name of love He looks naïve But he's actually the devil inside He's one of a kind Truly one of a kind I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo I have got a mannerless Romeo Now I am in trouble Sway, sway harder Why are you so late? My UPSC coaching. It's a guy. More hidden qualities of your Neha Sharma. Please try... Look, your wife's kissing him. No, Cyber, this is something serious. No wonder Sinha's getting his daughter married to me, as soon as she turns 18. Stop! Rascal, where do you think you're going? Where are you going? Look, my father is just a fourth grade government officer. You won't get any ransom, please... Do you love Neha Sinha? -Neha? Neha who? -Neha who? Rascal... -My future wife. -Wait! Wait, don't scare him. Don't scare him. Do you love her or not? Tell me. -I do, a little. -What? Little... -No, no! -Little... You love her a little? I love her a lot. That's exactly why I went to see her one last time. -Will you marry her? -How can I marry your future wife? We're not asking, we're telling you. You're going to marry her. Don't worry, come on. Don't worry, I said I won't hit you. Come. What's your name? Tell me your name? You're sweating. Wipe your sweat. -Amit Kumar. -Look, Amit Kumar. She's a nice girl, marry her. -That's fine, but, Neha's father... -Yeah? That old man has taken her phone, internet connection, Twitter, everything. How will I get there? Don't worry, I am there. I'll arrange everything. Are you crazy? Why take the risk of eloping her from her wedding? Let's do it before that. You don't get it, don't you? If the wedding procession doesn't get there, uncle will be ruined. His serial will be scrapped. Why are you so concerned about your uncle's serial? What about our life that's turned into a daily soap? When I was a kid, I had no parents, uncle was everything for me. He always stood behind me. And now that he needs me, I must stand with him. I will have to help him. I can't just leave him alone. And Neha... Nimmi, we'll need your help. Understood? Go to Neha Sinha's home tomorrow morning. It's her 18th birthday. Go meet her under the pretext of wishing her and show her Amit Kumar's video. Convince her that sissy is ready to marry her. Okay? And at any cost... And at any cost, convince her for our plan. When the wedding procession leave, you and Amit Kumar will disappear. You two must get there before we do with the guests. Neha Sinha will be waiting for you in one of the rooms in Pataliputra Heritage. Pick her up from there. I'll hire a white ambassador and tell him to park downstairs. Take the taxi to Bodh Gaya, where Dadua will get you two married and get it registered. And when we arrive with the guests, things would've already gone awry. After Neha Sinha disappears, Sinha will be embarrassed. Okay? He'll quietly approve the serial. Uncle will be happy too, everything will be fine. And anyway, it's only for a couple of months. Sinha and Family will finally accept Amit Kumar. -Just like Milky-Shonku case. -Wow, Little, proud of you. What a plan. Here... have a peanut. -Mithilesh? -Yes. Uncle, I have finished all the arrangements. -Everything is okay. -Okay. It's going to play, it will blow everyone out. Look here, I have finished all the lighting as well. Take a look, see, it looks so beautiful. What happened? No connection. So after all you made me a guest in your wedding. -Shall we? -Come. Let's deal with this. I am your better and you're my best You're my bird and I am your nest So why do you keep taking my love's test? I don't keep taking your love's test Get it See... RunningShaadi's made such a grand arrangement for your wedding. Get in the feeling. You're my east, you're my west You're my prayer and you're my request You're my ludo, I am your chess You look like new and I'm so fresh So why do you keep taking my love's test? I don't keep taking your love's test Nimmi! Something's not right, Little. Yeah, even I don't understand what's going on here. Everyone looks happy. You know what, go inside and check whether Neha ran away or not. Go. Call Cyber. -Call Cyber. -Yes. Quickly. go on. I wonder what happened? Uncle? Uncle? Uncle? Uncle? Uncle, why's everyone so excited? Is everything all right? It's their daughter's wedding, after all. -They are bound to be excited. -Right. Mr. Sinha is giving 5,100 and a really cozy blanket as a welcome gift. Unbelievable! Seems like uncle just robbed an ATM. Yeah. But only 20 rupee notes. Garland, garland. -Ujala. -Two hearts uniting. Uncle, you too. Take this garland. -Blanket, give me the blanket. -Blanket. Here's the blanket. -Why spend so much? -It's done now. Come, come, come, sit. A bit more ahead. Photographer? We've paid him in full. Look here. Look here, look here. You too, come. Let the children sit closer. Look here, children. -Smile. -What's going on? Thank you. Nimmi, what happened? Neha is still in her room, she didn't run away. -What? -What now? Did you talk to Cyberjeet? Some girl keeps calling continuously on your number. One of my constables was doing his duty, but he bribed him with 50 rupees and said share it. Firstly, he was driving that antique piece, without any papers or driving license either. And then bribery. I had to push that heap of junk all the way to the station. -Well, what's plan B? -Nimmi, plan A never failed. So we never had plan B. Do this, go tell your uncle everything. And tell him to forget all about his TV serial. What are you saying, Nimmi? How can I do such a thing? My uncle and his company will be ruined. You'll have to do something, Nimmi. You're stepping into your new life now. -Life isn't easy after... -Neha! -What have you done to her? -What happened? What happened, madam? -Are you the beautician? -Yes, I am. What kind of makeup is this? -What is this hairstyle? -It's fine. -Is this how she's going to get married? -I chose this hairstyle from a magazine. It's really awful. Sister, I have been trying to tell her since morning, that it's an awful hairstyle, but she doesn't listen. She just finished doing your makeup. -How can you tell her since morning? -Brother, please don't interfere in female matters. -Listen to me-- -Nimmi, listen to me. Everyone's waiting out there, we're losing precious time. Her photo and video, everything will be ruined. I'll fix it. -I'll be back soon, don't worry. Okay. -Oh, God-- -Please go, please. -Listen-- -Go. -Stop pushing-- It's her wedding, what have you done to her? -I kept telling her that, but-- -We don't have time. You did what you had to do. But everyone's waiting. Stay here, I'll be right back. Everyone's waiting. Unbelievable. Sister... Tell me something, why did they shift you to the third floor? There was some electricity problem out there. Sister, think of something. -How do I get you out of here? -Think, think, think... It took me four hours to do her makeup. I know you did, you're an artist. I can see that in your eyes. Are you thinking of something? Come here. Climb up. Look... walk on these bricks, till there. Then jump down from there. I'll bring a ladder and help you climb down. What if I fall down? You will only break your back. But if you get married to Bharose? -Eat some... -No, no... -Come on, you'll feel better. -I don't want to eat. I apologise on her behalf. -You know what, just do as I say. -Yes. -Go get some sweets. -Yes. -And ice-cream. -Yes. -Keep the tools down. Keep it. -Now go, and hurry up. Sister, I am scared. -Come on, one, two, three. -No, hail Goddess. Fine, that too. Quickly. Don't waste time, or I'll push you. Wait, wait, wait, sister. -Hail Goddess. -Yes. Fine, I am doing it. Careful, see you downstairs. Here, eat it. Eat... please. See... -Are you guys done? -What done? I mean, If you guys are done setting, let her hair set in. Don't disturb her for 10-15 minutes. Why won't we, why not disturb... Don't disturb her. You act like you're the queen or something. You play with someone's sentiments. Just too much. -Let it be, let it be. -I... She will make her look like a movie-star, I would like to watch too. Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Save me! Save me! Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! -Where's the back gate? -There? Thank you. Hey, is your name Ramkhilavan? Why are you sleeping? Get up! Didn't I tell you? She's looking really beautiful. Priest... I must go to the bathroom. Of course, you can go, but after completing the nuptial rounds. But I must go now. Hold it for a minute, it's almost done. Breathe easy. Concentrate on your belly button. Hello... -He's busy on the phone, I must go... -You can't get up like this. He's busy on the phone, see. I'll throw that phone in the fire. Nonsense. Listen, brother-in-law. Bloody Cyber. Why isn't he answering the phone? Bloody fool. Get done with it... What the... What can I do if he has to pee? It's almost time. Now start... Come on, you're delaying everything. What are you two whispering? -What happened? -What happened to the light? Curse you. Must be a blown fuse. No electricity. What kind of arrangement is this? Find out. Where's the generator guy? What insolence is this? What arrangement is this? Calm down, please. Buntu, go check. Sinha sir... you knew your daughter had an affair, yet, you were so hasty in getting her married to my son. What are you saying, Ujala? Youngsters always do such thing before marriage-- What nonsense! The last time I felt this bad was when Laloo sir was jailed. No need to worry. Prasad, what happened? I spoke with them, we'll know really soon. I spoke with the CA... the PA... -Yes, we'll know in ten minutes. -Ten minutes. Not a single train will leave Patna station without my permission. -Listen-- -Brother-in-law! -Listen, don't call me brother-in-law. -Please... -Your daughter ran away. -Yes. -Get it. -Uncle, let me make it clear. I won't marry a runaway bride. It's a matter of my reputation. Listen, do one thing, return his serial. We don't want any kind of relation with such people. How can we return the contract? We don't want your favor. -What favor? I trust Shanti Productions. -Yes. Why drag the serial in all this? And anyway I already signed the contract in the morning. It's already been passed. Look, it's our mistake, my daughter ran away. Forgive us. Look, son. He's the girl's father after all and he's trying to atone. Get it. Sit down everyone... and tell the MLA to stay in ICU. -Yes, of course. -Yes. Tell him, tell him. Now get some rest, and get some tea for my son. Get some tea... some ginger tea... -Cardamom too. -Cardamom tea. I have a headache from wearing that headgear for so long. -It's possible. -Massage his head. Get some tea, spiced tea. Cyberjeet Singh. First time in the history of RunningShaadi you failed me. All because you tried to be over smart with a cop. He showed you, didn't he? Thank God I ran into Shonku. Brother, glad to meet you. So the guy, getting married outside, is you. Forget it. What are you doing here? Basically, I have come for a... you know, conference. Can you do me a favor? I can lay down my life, without any condition. Tell me what to do. You're not needed anymore... And what's funny is, Sinha uncle, he's searching all over the city for his daughter. Searching, searching... But his daughter is right here. All that's fine, but what's the plan ahead. Plan remains the same. We'll call a taxi and you two go straight to Bodh Gaya. And you two? Beyond this is outside my coverage area. You got to handle it. If you make it out alive, then come see me in the evening. We've a meeting with Muktiyar. I remember. Hey antivirus, don't take it too seriously. Thanks. No virus. Well, see you then. Take care. Bars... that don't break Think again... I say it's a bad idea. Love breaks it all Nimmi, I am tired of eloping with you. Now that we're here, let's deal with it. Nimmi. That double barrel which hangs on uncle's wall. Does it work? Papa would clean it every Sunday. I guess it works then. Doesn't matter, uncle is a big miser. He won't waste 80 rupees bullet on me. Yeah, but he will definitely kick you. You can take it for me. So that's your love, I should take the beating for you. No... Encoded by mAck | @ mAck Encodes |
