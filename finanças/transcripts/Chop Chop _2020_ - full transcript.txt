Hello there. I thought you were taking me out. Then take you out I shall. It's okay. No, no. One second, one second, one second. It's okay. It's good. You're a liar. How's the salt? Salty. Delicious, how's the salt? Not as salty as you right now. Thank you for dinner. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. - Tough day at work? - Mm-hmm. Taking a load up north next week. Some marketing conference. Overnight? All right, I think I'm drunk. Well, it does pay OT and I figured we could use the extra dough. Open a window. Yes? We didn't order any pizza. It's for you. I have abilities. Is he dead? Unconscious. Are you okay? Oh, God I'm out of shape. What... what happened? I don't know. I don't know. He came at me and started attacking. Okay, okay, it's alright, it's alright. Well, he's dead now. I'm so sorry. - Have you ever seen him before? - No. You don't think I'd remember a face like that? - Call it in. - What? Call it in. - Wait. - No, we call it in. - I'm calling it in... - Wait, no. Don't. It was a break-in. It was an accident. It could happen to anybody. We're not anybody. I don't think we have much of a choice here. - He didn't break in. - What do you mean? - You let him in? - No. He was already inside. He was standing out there. Yeah, he had a pizza box. I said, "We didn't order any pizza." I closed the door... he was sitting there. - Okay. I know. I know. I know. - I never let him in. - It's okay. - I have no idea how he got in. I know. You might have a concussion. No one knows we're here, okay? Okay? Just trust me. We have a line on the suspect's vehicle. Standby for plate. - Ah, of course. - How's it going in there? Lock the door. No one comes in. Be careful. - Olivia, it's Jerry. - Oh, hey, Jer. - Oh, hey, Jer. - Hey, hey. Um, uh, is everything alright in there? Tip-top. Okay, I... I thought I heard a noise, and I saw a man outside so... A man, what did he look like? What did he look like? Um... No, I haven't seen anybody. Mm. You alright? Your... Oh this, yeah, no, I... I took a bump earlier. - Oh. - Small space, you know? Yeah, okay. Well, uh, you probably gotta get back so... - Yeah, I better get back. - Yeah, okay. I will probably call the sheriff's department and have them look around. Hey, you be safe, okay? That party downstairs was out of control. Oh, no. - We should... - Hey, Chuck! Cold one out there, huh? - I, um... - Going somewhere? No, we, um... I, uh... We um... I'll follow you and we'll drop the car off after. Okay? - I will be, soon. - Okay. Um, just grab one of these. Yeah. - What's going on? - I don't like this. Like, like what? What do you... - Just get in the car. - No. Not like this. - Like what? - This, like this. - There's a better way. - You didn't get the stuff. I don't like this. I hate this, but why didn't you do the plan? Because nobody gets a barrel in the middle of the night. Yeah but it's not that... He's a friend. You didn't get the stuff? There's a better way. Baby, we don't have time for this shit. Just think for a minute. You're overthinking it. - You pay with cash, you go in, you go out, end of story. - Just listen. Just listen for a second. ...for you or something like that. You need to get to a gas station as soon as possible so... Is everything okay here? Yeah, we're okay. - Are you okay, miss? - Yeah. I was just helping the lady with some car trouble. Do you know this man? No. We were just leaving... We were just leaving actually. I'm all set. Is this your vehicle? Yeah. Alright. Alright. You can leave... Miss. Yes. Now would be a good time. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah, okay. Okay. You mind popping the trunk for me? Is there a problem, officer? Did I do something wrong?

Yeah, we're in the car as we speak. Yeah, yeah. Go. Now, this address I'm about to give you, you go straight there. You're gonna pick up a package for Clark. A package? Christ. Nothing's free, kid. Alright, go. Uh-huh. I'm here for a package. So, uh, Rex told me that you... Access granted. Some project, ain't it? I'm gonna need a few minutes. Nope, not it. Nope, that ain't it. Nope, that ain't it. What you looking at? Nothing. Here with Jeff... Jeffery. Just a second, man, I'm doing what I can here. Jefferey, this square with you? Yeah. He's mine. You ain't fuckin with my man, right? No, I'm here for a... Here for a package. Oh... Mm-Hm. You ain't, uh, fucking with my man, right? - No. - Hmm, like this? Looks like a glock, right? - Yeah. - Um-hm. Nah, fucking grenade launcher. This little fucker will light up the whole room. The whole room. Boom! Relax, square. Takes a little firepower to ignite. Shit'll chop your stiffy right in half. Best sword craftsman in the business right there. Ain't that right, Butch? Shut your mouth and get your dumb ass back to work. This one's a little slow in the head if you know what I mean. Yeah, I met him at a freaking Arby's, chowing down on some briskets with his brother. - Brother? - Yeah, he's a visionary too. Say he can walk through walls or some shit. Like a fucking unicorn. Anyway... here. And don't break the seal. I don't want to hear any complaints this time. You got me? Hmm. What you looking at? Jeffery. Wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Come on now. No, no, no. Wait, wait. You trying to slice us up, square? Look, fellas, it's a misunderstanding, that's all. Well, come on in. Get out of here. I think that car's been following us. It's slowing down. It's slowing down. Are you sure? You should get some shut eye. I can drive. I can drive. I'm alright. I'm alright. How you doing? I'm not sure. He was a dad. Fell out of his pocket. It's almost over. Are you sure about this guy? Eyes open. Yes? Um... Uh, I'm Chuck. I have something of yours. It got shuffled around a bit. Sorry. Merchandise in the trunk? Yeah. We thought he was dead. Who the hell are you, people? Ah... Had some fun with that one, didn't you? Yeah. I'll take it from here. No. Anything else I can do you for? Now... get back in there. Get back in there. Anyone lose a badge? It's... It's not... it's... It's a long story. Oh? - I can explain. - I... Wait. Wait. Wait... I can explain, okay... Nobody needs to get hurt... No, no. Mm-mm. I just hate a copper when I see one. Pardon me. Pardon me. Please explain. Alright, look. This has been the single most bizarre night, just one giant misunderstanding... - We, we... - Hang... hang on. Little daisy. You mind, popping the trunk again for me, hun? No! Don't you look at me funny. I'm just kidding you. Nothing touches this face. Welcome back. Yeah. Sorry about that. Had to be done. You understand? What are you gonna do? Speak. - You don't understand. - No. I don't. First, you don't kill him. Then... then you put him in the back and then you bring him here to me. A lawman. A man of law, the police. You and... You sweet, sweet angel. Don't fucking touch her. Christ. Yeah. I made a few phone calls while the two of you were off snoozing. There's a lot of bad blood, man. You burned a lot of bridges, here too. Enough... enough that it would force someone in your position to consider switching sides. - Turn to the law, perhaps? - No. - No, no, we would never. - Oh? Point is, I... couldn't trust you. Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't. But, I like you. I look at you... I look at us. And I look at you. Hey. You remind me of my mom. You sick fuck. Okay, okay, okay, fine. Fine. I can't wait to slice you up like string cheese. I'll talk. I'll talk. I'll be back. Alright, I'll talk. Alright, just come over here. One wrong answer, two wrong answers, three. Capeesh? Capeesh? Yeah, yeah. Wait. Liv, no. No! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. Okay, please. No. She doesn't know a fucking thing. Okay, please... Take this fucking thing off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take this fucking thing off! Take it off. I'll tell you. I lied. I lied. Which part? He paid me. He paid me to bring him here. That's all I know. Son of a bitch swore nobody knows. Mm. No! Liv. Hey, baby. Breathe. That's it. Look at me. Look at me. Hey. Hey, just look at me. Look at me. Good, breathe. You've got to breathe through it, alright? Breathe, breathe. Just look at me. You gotta breathe. Question. Where did you meet the brother? What? His brother. Oh, yes. It's time for the main event. Gentlemen. My lady. Keep an eye on them for me, won't you, Butchie? Atta-boy. If you so much as move a muscle, Butch here will cut your little stiffy off and, uh, feed it to your bitch over there. Ain't that right, Butch? A man of few words. Oh... and I tried to stop him but he looked in the bag anyway. He knows what you did to his brother. Here we go. Just don't kill him yet. Shh. Just don't kill him yet. Here we go. Sorry. Where are you going, Butch? Butchie? Butchie? That's very funny. That's very funny. Ha-ha. Shit. Can you stand on it? Can you walk? That looks... That looks... It looks... It's good. Probably should get it looked at, though. You think you got one more in you? Go. Cut me loose and get the hell out of here. Go. Aw. I think I'd make a good Miranda. What about me? Glenn. - Glenn? - Mm-Hm. Why Glenn? I don't know. You look like a Glenn. Glenn. So, where to now? I got a place. Really? You do? We just gotta keep moving. You hungry? I think I'll go shower first. I'm gonna see if I can find some food. Any preferences? Anything but pizza. That car's been following us. I saw you there, fella. Did you order any food? Did you? Hey whatever happened to the guy before Jerry? Jerry? You mean the tall... Russian guy? I thought he was Ukrainian. Why? I'm not sure. Well, what's that? Guess we'll be eating tacos for a while.
