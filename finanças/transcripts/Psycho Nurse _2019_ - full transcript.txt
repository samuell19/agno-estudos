Dr. Ford to pharmacy. Dr. Ford to pharmacy, please. Oh. Thank God... that you're here. Where have you been? Can you take me home now? I don't want to be here anymore. Mo... More... air. Please. I'm scared. Ai... Air... I can't breathe. I need... I... I need... Please... Oh... Help! Well, we need help in here! - Hurry, it's a Code Blue! - Code Blue. Come on! Come on! - Come on! Code Blue! - Come on. - Let's go, all technicians. - Get a backboard under her. - I got it. - All right. Check... Where's the AED? Where is the AED? - Come on. - We need to hook her up. Somebody get the EpiPen ready. Where's the oxygen tank? Did it run out? - Come on. - ...on the way. - Come on. - Her lungs needs suctioning. - Come on! - Get her stable. Before we transfer her to ICU... - We need some oxygen. - Emily, check the oxygen. - The oxygen's off. - Come on, Ms. Leonard. Turn up the oxygen. Come on, Ms. Leonard, this is not your time. Come on. Come on! She's alive! Okay, let's prep her to 7 in ICU. Hurry, let's go. Come on, Ms. Leonard. Come on. Breathe deeply. Ready for the transport to ICU. Mm. Honey, what smells so good? Now, why are you cooking? Hm, because I enjoy the craft of cooking and I like to know what's actually in my food and I love cooking for my man. Isn't, um, food the best way to a man's heart? Works for me. But didn't we take these off the menu? Oh, no, these are different. They're actually Max-friendly. I know that you love the full-butter, full-flour things. Don't worry, I didn't forget you. Look here. Hundred-percent pure maple syrup. Oh... - How did I get so lucky? - Mm. I don't know, you tell me. I could show you. Hey, don't forget who's in the house. - Right. Sorry. - Mm-hmm. - Made it. - Mm-hmm. Oh. Morning, mom, dad! Buddy! You made it down the stairs all by yourself? - Sure did. - Max, come on. You remember you're supposed to call down for help first. Mom, I can do it on my own. Babe, let him gain some independence. - It's good for him. - Yeah, and what if he falls? Then I'll get right back up again. That's right. That's my boy. - Where's Ms. G? - Right here. - Ms. G! - Oh, buddy! Max, I missed you so much. I missed you, too. Where have you been? I was visiting a friend. But it's fine, I'm back now. I'm not going anywhere for a very long time. Well, that's good because I'm not either. Sit with me. All right. Oh, uh... Hello? Yes, Dr. Keller. Thanks for returning my call. Oh, that's great news. Okay, thank you so much. Oh, I usually don't have time for anything more than a yogurt. Well, that is just, well, unacceptable. We're a breakfast house around here. I could get used to that. - Wait. I can have these? - Yeah. They're made with some anti-inflammatory stuff. Gluten-free flour, a special homemade strawberry compote, just for you. And some special syrup just for dad. And, well, maybe Gwen? - Do you do real sugar? - Only way to do it. Woman after my own heart. Was that Dr. Keller on the phone? Uh, yeah. She was calling about Max's new medication. She responded to the voicemail I left yesterday. Oh, oh! I got it! I got it, little man. - Thank you, Ms. Gwen. - Not a problem. You know what, that is my cue. I've got to go. I've got an investors meeting at 9 a.m. Investors? Yeah, it's a massive shopping mall that we're building in the Bay Area. Wow! This family is just so full of movers and shakers. I'm so impressed by you all, especially you, Max. Anyway, enjoy your day off, buddy. And, hey, take it easy on your mom and Ms. G, huh? - Never! - Hey! Be careful. - Take it slow. - I got it, I got it, I got it. - Come on, little man. - Okay. How do I look? Like a million dollars. You're so sexy. Get out of here. - I love you. - Love you. Hey, buddy, careful with that in the house, please. - Hello! - Hello! - Thank you! - You're welcome. - How was the drive? - Uh, great. Oh, just got off the phone with that buyer. The intern must've given him the wrong confirmation number. Well, but he has the right one now, so crisis averted. Well, thank you so much for taking care of that. - I really appreciate it. - Don't sweat it. Oops! Hey, Max. - How are you doin'? - Doin' great. - Did you see that kick? - I did. - Can you play outside, please? - Hm? - Tag. You're it. - Oh, you're in for it. I'm gonna get you! He's doing so much better since she arrived here. Oh, they get along well, don't they? Yeah, a little too well, if you ask me. Sometimes I feel she's a better mom than I am. - Oh, Mira, stop. - No, I'm serious. It's true. I feel like he likes her more than he likes me. Do you think she's the right person for the job? Gwen? Oh, yeah, she's a total professional. I trust her opinions completely. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a little bit judged, though. Like, maybe she doesn't trust my maternal instincts or something. I don't know, maybe it's all in my head. She did just move in and I'm still getting used to her. - We all are. - Or maybe... Gwen's not the right fit. Have you thought about trying someone else? No, it... Not, not yet, at least. Well, there's a lot of companies who offer nurses like Gwen. And they have a lot of references you can contact. She checked out just fine and you should see them together. - They're wonderful, so... - Ms. G! Did you check her references? Oh... Where'd you find her? I... I don't remember, actually. Uh, actually, you know what, I think she found us. Well, if she hasn't murdered you by now, you're probably fine. Okay. I just want you to check this one out. - Okay. - See how that... - Ow! - Yeah. Max! Gwen! Max! You okay, little guy? Can you turn over? - Max! - Can you try to sit? Buddy, a-are you okay? - My arm hurts. - I'll call Dr. Keller. - No, that's not necessary. - What happened? Why weren't you watching him? I was watching him. It was an accident. It wasn't Ms. G's fault. My crutch broke. I can call the doctor to order those new crutches. No, I-I, I already got it. Dr. Keller. Hi. Yes, thank you. I'm sorry, Max just fell, his crutches broke, but I... Thankfully, it looks like he's okay. It's just a bruise. He's fine. Uh, if we could order those special crutches, the ones for kids with muscular dystrophy? I don't have muscular dystrophy. Gwen says that some of my muscles are just much stronger than some others. She says I'm like a superhero. What? Please don't say things like that. It's okay that he knows and understands what he has. I'm sorry, but he's just a kid. I want him to know that he's special, he's not different. I-I understand, of course, that's very kind. Come on, little guy, let's get you patched up. All right. That's a tough guy. All right, let's get inside. Sorry. Yes, thank you. Um... I understand. Okay. I will, I will. Thank you. I put Max down. He was wiped. - Oh, thanks for your help. - Just doing my job. I am so sorry about earlier. - I shouldn't have blamed you... - Oh, no, no, no, no. Mira, stop. That was a really stressful moment. How else is a mother to respond? I guess. I should get started on dinner, those veggies aren't gonna cook themselves. I think... Why don't you let me make dinner tonight? That's not necessary, you know? Mira, you are practically shaking. You are in no condition to be working with knives. That, that might be true. Go kick your feet up on the couch. I'll make sure everything gets done. - Just tonight. - Just for tonight. In the meantime, I'm gonna make you some of my special therapeutic tea. You're gonna feel so much better. Trust me. Hopefully. I have another appointment in the morning. - Thank you. - Of course. Thank you so much for sharing your story. What you've been through will definitely help us all learn, grow and become better parents of children with muscular dystrophy. How about you, Mira? Would you mind telling us your story? - Uh, hi, everyone. - Hi, Mira. Hi, Mira. Welcome to the group. Yeah, our-our son was diagnosed this year. And it all started when he, um, had some trouble following his friend, Owen, up the slide. So he tried and he tried, and I just watched, in slow motion, him falling backwards... on to the sand. And I rushed over to him and he just looked up at me and he said, "Mom, I'm so tired." It was awful at first when we got the news. But then after a while, I, I thought about it, and I thought, "You know what, it's going to be okay because now we know what it is, so we can handle it, right?" And I've been doing really well with it since then until yesterday. Ow! But he fell again, and... But he's okay, but I just, I feel like... I can't help but be overwhelmed... because I would like to be the best mom that I can be, but I can't if I'm so scared... every moment of every day. And I guess that's why I'm thankful that I'm here. So that's my story. Thank you so much for sharing. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thanks for sharing. Oh! - Oh, you scared me. - Sorry. - How was your meeting? - Oh, it was good. It's, it was really good, actually. It was nice to know I'm not alone. Yeah, I'm sure. Well, here, I made you some tea. It'll stay hot in this all day long. I got it from my yoga studio. It's neat, yeah? That was not necessary. Of course, it is. It's the least I can do. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello! I'm Dr. Keller. Oh, right. Yes. Hi. So nice to finally meet you. - You must be Gwen. - Yes, I am. Ah, Mira has said so many wonderful things about you. And from what I hear, you are truly a saint. Oh, that's so nice of her to say. Well, actually, it was Todd who said that. Anyway, I promised Mira I would drop these off on my way home from work. You know what, she's actually taking a nap right now. It was so nice of you to come over, but I can just take those crutches. Oh, no, no, I wanna make sure that they're gonna fit Max properly, you know? Do you know what? It's so funny. He is taking a nap right now, too. Well, maybe I should go home and get some shut eye, too. Maybe you should. I was just kidding. Anyway, I'll, uh, come back when Mira and Max are awake. No, that's unnecessary. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No problem at all. I live right around the corner. - Well, I'll see you later then. - You can count on that. Uh, uh, Gwen, by the way, you look so familiar to me. - Have we ever worked together? - No, I don't think so. Are you sure? I wouldn't forget. Never forget a face. Hm. Neither do I. It's gonna really bother me. But when I figure it out, I'll let you know. Sounds good. Just a minute! I'm coming! - Gwen? - Hi. Sorry to bother you. It's just, I finally remembered how we know each other. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, why don't you come in and refresh my memory? Follow me in the kitchen, I'm just cooking something. Thanks so much. Oh! Oh! W-What are you doing? You know who I am. Ida Leonard. Remember? You, you-you-you're that nurse who tried to kill Ida Leonard. Oh, no, I didn't try. I did kill her. But then I called for you and you brought her back. Why? Honestly, I don't know why. You'd have to ask my therapist. But I will say it gives me a sense of power I just can't get anywhere else. Y-you're not gonna try to kill me, are you? Oh, actually, I am. Why? Because no one comes between me and my family, especially not a disgraced doctor with a secret drug addiction. I don... I don't know what you're talkin' about. Of course you know what I'm talking about. Now, normally, I'd call for 9-1-1, but this is a different circumstance. I'm just gonna have to leave you here to die. - No. - Hopefully... Before you start stinking up our beautiful neighborhood. - No... - Goodnight. Please! Hello? Hi, Mira. So glad I reached you. Welcome to the community. Thank you. How did you find me? Phil, your group counselor, he gave me your information. Oh. Well, that was very kind of him. Uh, can you see me? No. Just your picture. It's like a telephone call, but through your computer. Uh, you can turn the camera on, though, and then I can see you. Just hit the button on the top right of the page. There you are. Phil told me that you were feeling a little overwhelmed. Oh. Uh... Yeah. I... I am. Well, unfortunately, that feeling doesn't really ever go away. - It doesn't? - Sorry. I'm trying to be comforting, but I'm doing a bad job, aren't I? No. No, that's okay. Thanks for trying. Um, how do, how do I see you? Uh, just hit the accept button and an image of me will pop up on your screen. Are you seeing it? Uh, it's kind of blurry. All I have is a low-res image. - Sorry about that. - Yeah, no... No, it's okay. No worries. Anyway, my son, Carter, has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, too. He's eight. So is mine. He just started second grade. And it's crazy. They grow up so fast. One day they're taking their first steps. - And then the next, they're... - Regressing. How did you deal with it? Well, I have help. Not as much as I'd want since my wife passed. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm just lucky to have had Jillian throughout this whole thing. - Who's Jillian? - Our in-home nurse. She's the only reason my wife and I got through the first few years. So you-you still feel like it was a good choice? - Even though your wife was sick? - It's the only choice. She's the one who got Carter on the right diet, the right crutches, everything! I couldn't live without her. We, um... My husband and I, we, we have our own live-in nurse. So I guess I did something right. Hey, I know I just met you, but I can already tell from your post that you're a great mother. You just want what's best for your kid. And if you ever doubt that, I'll always be here to remind you. Thank you for saying that. I needed to hear it. Goodnight, Mira. Goodnight, David. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, whoops! Johnny, whoops. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny... - Okay, so... - Okay, so try, try. I don't know, I-I, I feel like if I... Come on, you can. That's Karen. She-she, she's pretty worked up about that. - Hi. - Mira, you're all right? Yeah, just a little under the weather. - Come on. - Okay. My favorite family! - Good morning. - Hi, Auntie Karen. Hi, my Max and Todd. Hey, K. You got some new designs? - I do. You want to see? - Oh! - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Todd. - Whoa, whoa! It's okay. I'll just, uh, I'll just change real quick. - Whoa! - Uh, I-I can take care of this. Why don't you and Karen just go set up in the living room? I can get the boys out the door... Thanks, baby. Tha.. Oh, yeah, I'll-I'll get that in the laundry, ASAP. - How are you doing? - Good. Yeah, oh, I connected with another parent that's in the program I'm in. Gosh, it helped so much. - Oh. That's great, Mira. - Yeah. Oh. We need the handbag samples. Oh, right. They're, uh, in the office. Uh, no. You sit there, I'll get them. Hey, Mira, how's it going? Well, uh, Todd's putting Max to sleep. And I am, uh, having a rough week. Is it Max? Is he doing okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's great. I just have been so tired lately. I thought I had the flu or something, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Hm. You should let your nurse have a look at you. It's another perk of in-home care. Jillian helped me fight off a lot of stress colds. Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. I don't know, I just, I thought I would be fine by now. I didn't want to worry Todd. Um, I was thinking maybe it was just everything since Max has been diagnosed, it's finally catching up to me. - Sounds like you need a break. - Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly a take-a-break kind of girl. Maybe you just need the right person to show you how to relax. - Uh... - I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'll call you later. W... That was strange. Who's David? Why does he want to help you relax? Uh, he is a person that my support group leader recommended that I pair up with. Were you listening to me? Sounds like he wants more than support. - What? - I was just teasing. I came to see if you needed help with anything. Well, I don't. I've got it. Thank you. - What are you doing? - That's the wrong soap! I, I know that. I... I was, I got distracted. I would never... Sorry, I'll try to be less distracting next time I save us all from being poisoned. Gwen. Hey, I was just coming to tuck Max in. Oh, well, he's already asleep. - Oh. - It's okay. You know, he will still be there in the morning. - Right, right. - Is Mira still downstairs? Yeah, she's talking to some guy. Oh? Uh, what guy? Online. I think his name was David. Oh, you mean, David from the DMD group? Yeah, I don't really know. Is everything okay? I'm not sure. I'm kind of concerned. - About what? - About Mira. I just stopped her from using the wrong detergent on the dishes. - Really? - Yeah. Look, I-I know this isn't my place to say anything, but that seems like a really big thing for her to forget. Yeah, yeah... You know, she's been really busy with work. And you know what lack of sleep can do to a person. Right. Completely. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, you'd know best. - Yeah. - Okay. Well, goodnight. Oh. Goodnight. Sleep well. You, too. - She's still sleeping? - Yeah, I just... I-I don't get what's going on with her. Huh. - Yeah, um... - Oh, no, no, no. Let me do this. It's the least I can do. I don't wanna be a burden. Well, um, you're not a burden. Sometimes I think that Mira feels like I'm in the way. Like, maybe I should get a new post. No. Not at all. We need you. Okay? You're, you're like family now. - Really? - Absolutely. I think... I think Mira just feels guilty because she can't take care of Max all on her own. You know, I think that's what's keeping her up at night. I think it might be her online chat friend. Yeah, well, you know, that's my Mira, always trying to do everything herself. Anyway, um... You know, I think you two have a lot in common, actually. You and Mira are the true definition of altruism. How so? Well... you both want to help everyone around you, but you neglect yourselves. You are such a good guy, Todd. Most men don't recognize what women do. They take us for granted. - You don't. - Oh. Todd? Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing down here? I just got through putting you back to bed. Why? I-I have to make breakfast. I have to make, uh, lunch for Max. We have protein pancakes for Max and a breakfast sandwich for Todd. Wow. Two different breakfasts? That's impressive. How early did you have to get up to do all that? 5:00. But I'm used to it. Morning, mom. Hi. Hi, buddy. Hey, buddy. Hm. Smells great, Ms. G. Um, I missed you in bed last night. I didn't come to bed? How... I just walked you up from the couch, like, an hour ago. You don't remember? No, I don't. Babe, seriously, you need to get some more rest. - Hey. - Hm? Maybe cut down your screen time, huh? Yeah. Okay. - Here. Relax. - Thanks. Oh... Todd, here's your sandwich, I did three eggs, just like you like it, instead of two. There's a little bit of fruit on the side for you, okay? - Hey, Karen. - Mira. - I'm gonna kill you. - Why, what's up? Stop playing dumb. The flowers you sent me are gorgeous. But I'm still mad that you reminded everyone that I'm 30. Is today your birthday? You don't remember ordering these? Well, I... I mean, I must have, so you're welcome. I'm getting worried about you. Maybe it's finally time you saw a doctor. Yeah. Uh, I think you might actually be right about that this time. Okay, Ms. Reese is here. I have to run. Thank you again for the flowers. Yeah, uh, yeah. Happy birthday, Karen. I'll, uh, I'll-I'll call you soon. Gwen, I told you I would take care of the laundry. Did you send Karen flowers? - Yeah. Did she like 'em? - Why? Well, I saw it on your calendar it was her birthday. I just didn't want you to forget. Well, I can take care of things like that, okay? Well, you didn't, so I did. It's fine. It's what I'm here for. It's not what you're here for. You're here for Max. Yeah, but anything that helps you helps Max, right? Yeah, I guess you're right. Wh-whoa! Whoa there! Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I, I... Okay. Come on. Let's get you somewhere comfortable. I can get... I'm fine. Says the woman who just fainted. Come on. I will go to the doctor when I can. Please just don't tell Todd, okay? Okay, but sooner is better, Mira. Yeah, you're right, well, in the, in the meantime, please don't tell Todd that I fainted, okay? I promise. Hey, why don't you let me take your blood and, and bring it to the lab? You can do that? Yeah, I'm a registered nurse. That's what we do. I can get your blood panels back really fast. We should see if your levels are off. - Okay. Thank you, Gwen. - Of course. Be our little secret. So you're upset because. Gwen sent your friend flowers? It's not just that. It's... Ever since I almost made that mistake with the dishes, she's been doing everything. She's been taking Max to his appointments, doing chores, and now this. I mean, Gwen met Karen one time. Gwen's doing all this for the family, not Karen. Heh. Well, when you put it like that... I guess I sound like a bitch, huh? You could never sound like anything but an angel to me. Come on, don't do that, all right? You can't be flirtatious with me. Sorry. Sometimes it just comes out. Forgive me? Yeah, but I couldn't be mad at you if I tried. Hold on. - Hey. - Hey. I'm gonna take Max up to bed. You wanna come? Uh... Yeah. Babe? I'm gonna... I'm just gonna wait a minute. I'm gonna finish this up, and then I'll, I'll come upstairs, I promise. One minute. All right. These new crutches are great, huh, buddy? - Yeah, they are... - Yeah, look at you. You're starting to... Baby? Babe? Todd, you and Max need to get going. Right. - I'll be in the car. - Okay. Mom, did you just wake up? Yeah. Is, is it morning? You sleep a lot. Are you hibernating? Mom's not a bear, baby. I'm just really tired. Max, honey, time to go. - Bye, mom. - Bye. Have a good day at school. Oh, what is happening with me? Don't rush yourself. Gwen, I'm not getting any better. Mira, you're just exhausted. You need rest. Take another day and see how you feel. I'm so sorry for being short with you earlier. I have not been fair to you lately. I've been doing this work for a long time. I'm used to it. Yeah, and you've been so good to my family, working here seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. It's my pleasure, really. This is the family that I've always dreamed of. And a family is not a part-time job. That's for sure. Yeah, well, you need to have a night off, like, at least one night a week. It's fine, really. There's no place I'd rather be than here with Todd and Max and you. I want you to go out and spend some time with friends, go out on a few dates. Come on, Gwen, I want you to have what Todd and I have, someday. And I will have that someday very soon. But stop worrying about me. You need to think about yourself. Who's that? Just this guy. It's the weirdest thing. He's been messaging me and everybody else from the support group about David. "For your safety and the safety of your loved ones, do not take advice from or engage with David. He is not who he says he is. Please direct any questions to this address. D. Webber." What a freak. Please stop DM-ing me or I'll be forced to report you. People are insane these days. Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. - Oh, hey, where are you going? - I need to get back to work. No, you're in no condition to be working. Well, I don't have a choice. Karen's depending on me. I hope a hot shower will help. Or maybe a bath. And a change of clothes. So I'm feeling much better. I'm so sorry to worry you. So there's nothing in your blood that indicates anything? - Nope. Gwen was right. - Oh. She got the results back. I guess I just needed some rest. I think it might be a good idea to get a second opinion, one that has no connection with Gwen. Why would you say that? Just a feeling. "Hello fellow forum members." I'm very sorry about the spam. Webber, the person who e-mailed you all, apparently hacked the member roster in an attempt to slander me because of a personal dispute. "Please ignore him. Thank you." What? Oh, it's just drama in my support group. Yeah? This weirdo, he keeps spamming everyone in the group. Which weirdo? The world is full of them. This guy is saying that David is a fraud. Oh, look, he just sent another one. "I think your son might be in danger. We need to talk in person." That sounds sketchy. You're not gonna meet with him, are you? Well, what harm could it do? Uh, I don't know. He could kidnap you and kill you. Oh, come on, Karen. At least, meet in public. All right, there's your ice cream. And we're all set. - Mm... - Nice. This is my favorite ice cream. Mine, too. Well, like father, like son. Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. What? Well, at first, I thought that maybe... - Hey, buddy. - Yeah? Go and get started on your homework. - I'll be right back. - Mm-hmm. This last e-mail that I got, I don't know, there's something about it. I feel like I trust him. He has something to say. - So, he wants to meet me. - Okay. - Oh... - In person. Which I guess is weird. I don't know. He wants to meet you? Yes. Tomorrow, at the cafe. Karen thinks it's better if I meet him in a public place. Yeah, well, Karen's not a mother. She doesn't have a son or a husband to worry about. It's a cafe. It's in public. Nothing's gonna happen there. Okay, but imagine it was me asking or Karen. I mean, would you honestly let one of us go? I'll think about it, okay? Okay. Fine. Hi. Thanks for meeting me. - Webber. - Please, have a seat. Um, let me just start with this. David is my first name, but mostly everyone calls me Webber. There's too many Davids in the world now, you know? Coffee? - No, thanks. - Okay. I'm sorry, maybe I'm still a little fuzzy on this, but if you're David and Webber, then who have I been talking to online? That I don't know. So you don't have a six-year-old with muscular dystrophy and you're not a baker in Tulsa? No. I'm an investment banker. I can't bake and I don't have kids. I don't get it. Then what does this have to do with you? That's why I'm here. That's what I'm trying to figure out. This is my wife. Laurel. She had lung cancer. Never smoked a day in her life. I'm so sorry. It happened all too quick. The chemo, it was really hard on her. - Even though we had help. - Help? Friends, family, you know, in-home care. Really? You know, she worked for the city. She had great insurance, too, it just wasn't enough. And I knew she'd gone online for support. I was okay with that at first. She was happy again. I thought she'd made some good friends that gave her diet tips to help her feel less nauseous, a little more energetic. But what I didn't realize until last month was that she'd stopped going to chemo. She even stopped seeing her doctor. Why? Wha... Why would she do that? Honestly, I think someone online convinced her not to. And now I'm wondering if that person pretending to be me in that forum had something to do with it. I-I don't know. I mean, maybe David, he just looks like you. Maybe this is all a misunderstanding... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Mira... take a look at this. The guy in this picture and the guy in this picture. But... I've seen pictures of his son. This kid? Uh, maybe they are photoshopped. Come on. Think about it. Have you ever seen a picture of your David with his kid? I mean, what parent doesn't have a picture of them with their kid together? No one. Look. I don't know who this person is. I don't know what kind of game he's playing, but I will not... I will not let him do this to anyone else. I won't. She was my everything. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Oh... Ho... Oh! You okay? Yeah. I thought I was feeling better, but I guess maybe I'm not. It's okay. Watch your step. Take your time. - Easy does it. - Thank you. Well, thanks for meeting me. Yeah. It will be all right. Everything's gonna be okay. - Thanks. - Drive safe. Just a minute! Oh. Hi, Gwen. - Is Mira home? - No, she's at a meeting. A meeting? She didn't tell me about any meetings. Uh, well, I have some designs for her to approve, so I'll just set these down. I can take 'em. You know, I've been meaning to talk with you. Would you mind giving me a minute? Talk to me about what? Mira and Todd are very special people. - I agree. - Kind, generous. They see the best in people, even people who are unworthy. Are you implying something? Unlike my friends, I don't see the best in people, I see them for who they are. Hm. What does that mean exactly? I know what you're up to. How dare you walk in to my house and assume you know me? - Your house? - I'm sorry, it's Todd's house. Actually, that's who I wanna talk to you about. I saw you sniffing Todd's shirt in the laundry room. Now, I don't wanna have to tell Mira because you seem to be helping Max, but I want you to know, if you're planning on messing with this family, you're also messing with me. - Is that a threat? - It's a warning. Thanks for the warning. Oh, damn it. Todd. What's going on? I saw them at Lou's. I saw Mira and David! She met with him? Yeah. - I followed him. - Wait. Uh, wait, where are you? I-I-I don't know. Sierra... Some highway hotel. I don't know. So what are you gonna do? You're gonna confront him? Yeah. Maybe. Todd, go back to work. You have a kid to think about. We'll figure this out when I get home. You're right. I'll be home later. Damn it. Mom, you're awake. Hey. I am. Did you have a good time at physical therapy? Mm-hmm. - Now I'm really hungry. - I bet. Well, I have a plate for you over here. I think... I've got it. Okay. - Is Todd here? - Uh, no. He texted he's gonna be a little late tonight. You really didn't have to cook. There's so much food in the freezer. No, no, I'm, I'm actually feeling a little bit better. And I wanna get back to doing what I love. Hm. Hey, buddy, there's carrots in this. I need you to give me three bites, okay? Okay. Okay. Use your napkin, please. Thank you. Hey, are you not gonna stay for dinner? I think I'm actually gonna take your advice and go see a friend. Is it a first date? Old flame's in town. Have fun! I will! Who is it? - Gwen? - Hello, Webber. - Heard you were in town. - Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since Laurel's funeral. Well, who told you I was staying here? My new client. Mira. Wait? What? Mira? - Hey, be careful. - Hm. Wow. Laurel was so beautiful even when she was dying. I gotta know why you were so sad when you lost her. She was my wife. Of course I was sad to lose her. How come you couldn't see a future with me? What? You... Gwen, you were her nurse. It's important for you to understand that I really did everything I could for her. But if someone doesn't wanna get better, there's just nothing you can do. Laurel, she didn't want it bad enough. She wavered on my homeopathic therapy. If she had just committed, then maybe, but... You, you told her to stop the treatment? She had stage-four cancer. It already spread from her lungs to her bones, to her brain. The chemo you had her on was just killing her faster. Laurel's only chance at life was spontaneous remission. She just wasn't strong enough, so she died. But I made it painless. Most importantly, I was there when it happened. Mine was the last face she ever saw. I was her angel of death. You're crazy. You're insane. I knew it was you. It took me a minute to figure it out, but I knew it was you. I'm gonna kill you. Hurts, doesn't it? You know, it wasn't my intention, but I guess I'm your angel of death, too. You're not gonna get away with this. What are you doing? Oh, Todd, you scared me. Is she still asleep? Have you been drinking? Yeah, I've had... two beers. You know, to take the edge off. I need her to know what I saw. I need to know why she's cheating on me. Oh, Todd... Honey... - Gwen? - Come on. We need to get you cleaned up. We'll finish this conversation upstairs. Come on. Oh, watch your step. Okay. You got it. Let's get this off you. Oh. Hey. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I'm helping you get ready for bed, silly. I-I, I can, I can do that myself. - Okay? - Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push you away. Mm, it's fine. You're a man, I get it. Men like a little independence to do things for themselves. Well, yeah, when it comes to taking off my clothes, I can do it. Oh, Gwen, thank you very much. Goodnight. Do you ever get lonely? What do you mean? It just gets so lonely in that room. All by myself, downstairs. I'm... sorry to hear that. Gwen, wh-what are you doing? I hate the way she's treating you. You are such a good guy. You deserve better than this. Okay. Uh... It has, it has been a-a really stressful day and I think maybe... it's time for you to get some sleep, too. - I could use some rest. - Uh, downstairs. Oh. Okay. Well, you know where I'll be if you want company. Mom? Shh. I'm here, honey. There's nothing to worry about. Good morning, Todd. Are you okay? Yeah. I feel like I got hit by a bus. Oh, no. I really need to talk to Mira. Why don't you take yourself out to breakfast? Have the morning off to think everything over. I can handle Max. And I'll tell Mira to call you the second she wakes up. Yeah, uh, yeah, th-th-that's a, that's a good idea. Uh, I could use some time to myself. - Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, Todd, um, I just wanted to say there's no hard feelings about last night. - Okay. Good. - Yeah, you had a lot to drink. And I'm not gonna tell Mira what you said. What I said? Oh, well, it's not that I wasn't flattered, I, I was, but you're a married man, and I believe in marriage and what it stands for. I know you do, too. You just weren't thinking clearly. Alcohol does that to people. I thought that... I apologize for anything inappropriate that I may have said to you. Oh, no. No, no worries. It's already forgotten. Yeah, we would make a great couple. It just can't happen in this lifetime. Mira's already got you. Right. - Uh, excuse me. - Have a good day. Hi. You've reached Karen. Leave me a message. Sorry. I got held up last night. The little guy was up all night with something awful. Little guy, I missed you so much. Come on, little guy. I got it, little guy. He's my little guy. The little guy was up all night with something awful. "Little guy." This is crazy. I'm going crazy. Why would she keep these? Hey, how was school? I did great. I got an A on my math test. Oh, that's good. - You're home early. - Oh, we texted you. We just wanted to come check in on you before the appointment. Oh. What you doing? Oh, I was just doing some work, some e-mails. Oh, hey, careful on the stairs, Max. Well, you shouldn't worry about that. Honestly, I'm pretty surprised to see you up and about. You were basically dead to the world this morning. Mm. Yeah. I just got up, actually, just, just now. Oh. Well, that means you need more rest. Why don't you go to the couch? Make yourself comfy? I'll get you a fresh thermos. Okay. What you reading? I'm just texting Karen about some work stuff. That's odd. Why's that? No, no reason. You really should be resting. Yeah, mom. I learned in school, your body heals better when sleeping. - It's a fact. - You're right. Your body also depends on water to survive, so you should be drinking. She's right. Your body's made up of 70 percent water. How'd you get so smart? Drink up. Good. All right. We'll see you after physical therapy. Gwen? Max can skip physical therapy today. No, I can't. We're playing soccer today. Mm, well, we could play soccer here at the house. Mira, it's fine. Just relax. We'll see you later. - Come on. - Bye, mom. Feel better. My name is Mira Lloyd, and I'm making this video as evidence. - Yeah? - Todd! I've been trying to reach you. - So it's true. - Is what true? You and David. I saw the two of you together. No, you are completely misreading. David is a friend and he is in danger. We all are. I think I have proof. - Proof of what? - It's Gwen. I have pictures and I have a video on my phone to show the police. We have to get Max first. - I... Wait. - What are you talking about? - Mira! - I'll call you back. - Hi. - What's going on? Uh, where's Max? At physical therapy, of course. Right, right. Yeah. Where are you goin'? Uh, I just, um... brought this down for later. Mira, you look a little feverish. I think I should make you something. Actually, you know what, I'm feeling much better. Don't be silly. You need something. Ah... What? You have something on your cheek. Oh. Oops. So, Mira... what'd you do today? Nothing. I... Mira! Max isn't at physical therapy. Where is he? Leave this phone here and I'll take you right to him. Please. Just tell me, is Max okay? I would never do anything to hurt Max. He's my little guy. Tell me, why are you doing this? You never valued the importance of a real home in a woman's life, Mira. Something of your own to take care of people to love and love you back until the day you die. Uh, uh, I don't understand. Before I met Todd and Max, I had nursed people all over the country. But no matter where I went, I just never felt at home. I always felt like a visitor. So I decided it was time for me to find my own family. So you can imagine how thrilled I was when I met Max. My sweet, darling boy who adores me and also just couldn't run away if he tried. - Please, Gwen... - And Todd. So caring and devoted. He'd stick by his unfaithful and borderline involute wife even when a far superior option has presented itself. I have never been unfaithful. Then why have you spent your nights chatting with some guy who was clearly flirting with you? I never flirted back. But you also never told Todd. Even when you went out to meet Webber, you kept him in the dark. Gwen... What kind of wife and mother would do that? Mira! Max! Mira! My name is Mira Lloyd. And she's been drugging me for weeks. So today I'm shooting a video evidence of Gwen's room just in case something happens to me. You just loved the extra attention. I understand. I get why Todd said we're alike. We're nothing alike. You hurt people. No, wrong. I help people. I take them away from their pain and loneliness. You hurt Todd. You betrayed his trust, broke his heart. - I would never do that. - You try to kill people. Yeah, but I only actually kill the ones that put my family at risk. People like... Dr. Keller... Karen, Webber... Wait... No. You didn't. I would sacrifice anything for my family, unlike you. Max! Max! Max! Max! Max? Where is he? Where is he? What did you do to him? I only lied the second time. Max is in physical therapy, he's fine. Did you actually think I would drag my Max into this? That I would be the one to steal his innocence? - You're a monster! - You're one to talk. I'm the one that's been here taking care of Todd and Max. And I plan on continuing to do so. So what? What, are you, you're gonna kill me, too? I mean, I was gonna help you die honorably, but then you had to go behind my back, so... Do you hear what you're saying? Do you really think that Todd and Max aren't gonna notice that I'm gone? That they're not gonna figure out what you did to Webber? Oh, no, what you did to Webber after a lovers' spat in a motel. See, the knife I used to sever his gut is covered in your fingerprints. The blood I drew from you was all over the crime scene, and, yup, you are the last person to have been seen with him at the cafe. Oh, also, you were so worried that Cathy, that dumb waitress, was gonna say something, so you kinda killed her, too. Please tell me that you didn't do that. I didn't. I just thought you'd been sleeping a lot. You were acting strange. I kept telling you to go to the doctor, and you wouldn't listen to me. And then, today, both you and your car were gone. You left Max at physical therapy all alone, without a ride, like the negligent mother you are. See, the police are gonna come later today or maybe tomorrow and that's what I plan on telling them. And then somebody is gonna clock your car at the end of that driveway, and then they'll just figure out the rest. - Figure out how insane you are? - No. Mira, stay with me. That you stole my keys and you holed yourself up here. But then you were so overcome with guilt and shame... that you used the last of poor Ida's pills... and you took your own life. Please don't do this. Think about Max. You don't wanna do this to Max. You don't wanna take his mother from him. I am not taking anything from Max. - I am gonna be his mother now. - It doesn't work that way. Mira, come on. Admit it. Even before I moved in, you hated being stuck in that house with Max. All you wanted was just to go back to work with Karen. - That's not true! - Mira... I am just helping you be honest with yourself and realize that the life that you had is not the life you wanted. I am giving you your freedom just like I did with Laurel and Ida. Stop struggling. Do the right thing for Todd and Max for once! I am! Stop struggling! Someone's feeling much better. Oh, yeah, I'm back to my old self again. That's good because I missed you a lot. I didn't like the sleepy mom too much. - I love you. - I love you, too. Well, I love both of you. Bring it in! Family hug. - This is the best. - Watch this. Hey, you're looking much better, buddy. That physical therapy is really helping. Now that we know that he doesn't have muscular dystrophy, the therapists can start working on building up the muscles in his legs. Todd, Max has muscular dystrophy. No, honey. You heard the doctors, he doesn't have it. He just has a muscle disorder, he'll grow out of it. No. Max has muscular dystrophy. Sweetie, he doesn't have it. Yes, he does. The doctors are wrong. Okay, uh... Uh... Okay. Hey, buddy, let's, uh... Let's, you and me, go for a walk. All right. Cool.
