- Oh, my God. Good morning, Mr. Vidal Black and White, Mr. Cervantes. Just Black and White It's how I like the finances and life as well. Clear and simple... Black and white. There is no such thing as pure black and white in life, sir. There is only black and white in death, death ennobles us. Help! Help me...! I need HELP! This letter comes from China, is marked as confidential. I think you should open it. It is addressed to the Cervantes Bank, not the successor. - Yes? - From the jaws of the Dragon. - No. - A moral debt, The son of a debtor sends money to the Cervantes Bank, from Formosa. - Outstanding. - The original amount was very small, now is great because of the interest. - That money is yours, Mr. Cervantes. Mr. Vidal, when your fater seized our Bank... ...Cervantes Bank, everything fell into his hands. - You said it was a moral debt. - Yes I said it. I want you to keep that money, for the same reason that the Chinese returned the money to the Bank. I was very young when your father stayed with the spoils of my father's bank. When dad fisrt saw the plaque on the door that read "Vidal Bank", he bowed. At that moment I appreciated the true value of money. We all know that my father stole the bank when your father had financial problems. That depends on your point of view. For me money is only paper. A dirty paper, which causes dissatisfaction and evilness. I often wonder if you are bothered to be employed at the Bank that once was of your father. I understand the reason for this man to pay the debt. And you Mr. Cervantes? Do you think that the money was for me? Even so, I will never accept it. Add it to the Calderon's account. Dad always said that business was not given to poets and scholars. Professor Calderón is making a very important research on the Toltecs. I can deposit into his account, anonymously. Fine. - The letter is in Chinese. - And with beautiful calligraphy. - Do you read chinese? - I have the advantage of being relatively poor, and I can enjoy a hobby. Money is a boy who never grows to be a man. A person loses his life caring for that child. There is not a saying form Confucius But he might have anticipated our western wisdom. - With regard to your pay, Mr. Cervantes... - It's enough, I have enough money to enjoy the jewels that are there in the night sky. Yes? No! Wait... let me think about it. I'm Mrs. Vidal. I want to talk with Dr. Gonzalez. He's gone! Who cares for the patients? Then, I want to talk with Dr. Saluby. The maid tried to commit suicide. She still breathing but I wonder if ... I want him to come here as soon as he leaves the operating room. Pedro, what's that? It is the rope that used my daughter, Consuelo. - They look like ties. - Yes, Madam, they are. From Mr. Vidal. - Hello! Did you miss me? - Where is Harry? He is happy, directing to Sophia Loren in Dubrovnik Come home tonight, there will be a party. I'll ask Muriel. Then there will be no party. You are a beautiful girl. You're full of life to die. - You can make any man happy. - Anyone but the man I love. All men are equal. We have two arms, two legs... - A head... - I also have these same things. And other that men have not. - You look better now. - Because of you. - Will you return here to complete the cure? - Always finish what I start. I'm Mrs. Vidal. How's Consuelo? Madame Vidal... I never imagined that you would be so beautiful. I can not imagine why Consuelo tried to kill himself, Dr. Saluby. A girl with a whole life ahead. - It is possible though that. She is alone. Has no reason to live. She has nobody to share her life. She has us. Her father, the other servers... Obviously that's not enough for Consuelo. These letters prove it. - Which cards do you mean?? - Ah, Nick... I want you to meet doctor Dr. Saluby. - My husband, Nicolás Vidal. - I regret why I ever met you... and your wife. I hope to see you again under better circumstances. How is Consuelo? She rests. She lies in my bed. I want her close, just in case... You wonder if she attempts suicide again? It is possible and even probable. - Why? - A servant is a low-value link in the chain of life. When she loves hes master. Hopeless, of course... I think Consuelo just try to do something to justify her mere existence. It's a frustrated girl, is not so, Mr. Vidal? - You were talking about some letters. - Yes, addressed to Consuelo, which describes her immoral behavior. This is impossible, Who could ever write this to Consuelo? Who knows? Anybody... perhaps Consuelo herself. Consuelo wrote dirty letters to herself? And then tried to kill herself because of those letters? - Ridiculous! - I never said that she has sent the letters. I only said that is possible... Perhaps she thought of sending cards due her frustration. Then she agreed to be immoral. And hes own remorse caused suicide. It's possible. My approach may be wright. - Wright? - The power of suggestion is the greatest force - both for normal people to abnormal. - I could write hundreds of letters and send them to myself - I will do, just to prove you're wrong. - Go ahead, Mr. Vidal. - Agreed. Prove that I am wrong. - Maybe I will. - Let's call it an experiment in self-hypnosis. - I have to go. I want to see Consuelo. Nick, Consuelo is going to sleep in my bed, Do you mind if I sleep in your bed tonight? None at all. I'll sleep in the study. Consuelo... Consuelo. Consuelo... Are you okay? You look so beautiful. Do not be afraid. - I feel ... so confused. - Do not worry, we all feel confused sometimes. We've all done weird things. It was for you. You made me think of... What? What did I make you think about? I was not sure that you feel as I do. Until that night... when you kissed me. That night? When I have kissed you? I can understand you very well, Consuelo. Everyone needs someone. I'm sure that you understand me, Mr. Vidal. Thank you. Well. Your case is somewhat different. - Why do you call it my case? - I think you know what I mean. This is the medicine I prescribe. - It has a sedative effect. - Not to me. I think you are wrong, doctor. I'm never wrong. Even doctors can make false diagnoses. My diagnosis was accurate. There's just a lack of treatment. I expected this. That was a conditioned reflex ... Embrace your needs. - I hadn't kissed another man since I got married. - I could feel it. You have kissed with burning passion, like a teenager. There is a cure for that. Do you think so? - Hey, Mr. Vidal. I was leaving... Consuelo needs someone to take care. Ms. Vidal has asked me to come regularly to see Consuelo. Tomorrow... At what time? - It's OK for you at 2pm? - Perfect. It was a pleasure to meet you. I know the way out. Thank you for your interest ... in Consuelo. This letter arrived this morning. Adressed to you. - Thanks, miss Campos. There's a will to death in your hands... I have come sooner. I hope this doesn't bother you. I bought you this. Thank you. - I didn't know that you can read chinesse. - No, please... don't. Give me pleasure, Sidoni. Let your hair go. No, Nicolás... I'm sorry. No. - Why are you always acting like this? If you don't like the way I am, then don't come over here. You know I can help it. I never find what I really need in here. - No. - You know what I mean. I can't stand you keep rejecting me. Every time I feel more and more alone. Sometimes I feel... you disgust my hands on your body. Disgust you my kisses. Sidoni... Sidoni... Oh, Nicolás. - Good evening. -Good evening. - Allow me to tell you that tonight you're gorgeous. - Thank you. Do you know if Mr. Vidal will come to dinner at 8pm? Mr. Vidal said he's not going to dine here. He took his car and left. Thank you, Pedro. Doctor Saluby, please. - It seems as if I had come at the right time. - Agree, You couldn't come at a better time - And... if someone comes? - Don't worry about that. - And if you have an emergency? - Then, my colleague will take over. - This should remind your husband. - I don't know... I Never seen him naked. No doubt about that. He is a lout, and louts can't live well. - Despite being sons of pirates, and have inherited fortunes. - We must talk about him, at this time? - No. Not today. We don't have to mention his great complex fault. - Why don't you take off the stockings? - Do you want to make me feel uncomfortable? - Not at all. I just want you to remove the stocking. - To perform a medical examination? For two reasons: I want to find out "if you have geological wrinkles" - And what about the other one... Mr. Vidal. The lady has gone for a walk. - She is not here. - Ok. I'm glad to see you're fine, Consuelo. May I help you to find what you are looking for? I am looking for a letter adressed to the old Cervantes Bank. I can find it for you. When you kissed me, I knew we both have the same feelings. Consuelo... That was just an innocent holiday custom. For Christmas, I usually kiss Pilar and the other maids. But it wasn't the same, You have kissed my lips. I was going to kiss your cheek, but you moved your head. Things were not so. It was something like this. - Do not forget I'm married. - And you always remember that, Mr. Vidal. You can go now, Consuelo. Good evening, Mr. Vidal. This is an unexpected honor. - I am surprised Mr. Cervantes. - It's amazing how old stuff can seem new to us. - I had not thought of that. - This is my chinesse room. When I'm here, my world is full. Here the world is the way I want it to be. Do you think I'm silly for believing that I live in Xanadu? I could have believed that. But, after seeing this room understand. I think it's possible that everybody needs something like this. Do you care for chinesse tea? - I may not speak Chinese, but I appreciate the good tea. -Speak normally, she will not wake up. - Is she asleep? - Rather, she began a journey. She has a need. She needs her body to release his soul. She use that veil to allow air to circulate freely. Clothing imprisons us. A silver wire attached to the body with the soul. - This prevents that she understands her dream. The mind must go, and forget the things that haunts us. Indeed. A restless mind, prevents the body to relax. Her mind is in Ganghes. Away from her own flesh. I call this "Pan's hoof" She is obsessed with this deformity. Here, she can fly with wings. You also would give her the momentary peace. I understand... She needs her own chinesse room. The words flow better when you're comfortable. Please have a sit. Some time ago you kindly gave me a dozen letterhead from old Cervantes Bank. Do you still have some? I want to tell the story of the bank, including the episode of my father stealing it. And the bank would be mine. Do not feel remorse. One can not escape fate. Do you remember the story of a servant being threatening by death in Baghdad, and how he escaped to Samara? Then someone asked why Death had threatened the man with a gesture... Death replied it was not a threat but a gesture of surprise ... Death did not expect to see that man in Baghdad but in Samara. May I know how many paper sheets are being carried. - They are five. - Thank you. Do you want some more tea? No, thank you, I have to go. Thanks for showing me the chinesse room. I hope you consider this room as your own. - I found a delicious fruit. - I told you I don't want to be here. I want to go to the city, Carlos. I have no money. You said you were hungry, but I do not think you were referring to the fruit. Your skin burns. You need to take a swim. - Do you mean like Adam and Eve. - Yes, let's go find some grape leaves. - What's that? - It's... It's a deer hoof. Someone has killed this animal. Let's go. Someone is comming... - We probably have been seen. - I don't know, and I don't care. - Well, I do not want to end up in jail. - This is the brave diver. Just look at his own shadow and runs away with Mom. Hush! Someone may hear us. I don't care. I don't care about you, either. Please leave me alone. I will find a real man and... - How is he, doctor? - The pain has decreased. He has a great physical condition. Scrapes, minor wounds, and dizziness. Oh, and a bruised leg. - How was he fell off the rock? - He's a sleepwalker, I guess. - I don't think so. - Are you sure that you know him? - He doesn't know you at all. - What you're saying is offensive. The truth is not always pleasant... My dear, fix me a drink while I talk to your husband, - If that does not offend you, Madam. - With pleasure. Doctor Saluby. - What happened? - You felt off from a rock, Mr. Vidal. - Have you always been sleepwalking. - Never. I have a terrible headache. Maybe hypnotherapy can help. Relax your muscles. Listen to the progressive count. One... Two... three... four... five... Seven... eight... nine... ten... Listen nothing, but the sound of my voice... as you float in space, liying a cold white cloud. What was going through your mind? What thought almost caused your suicide? - Did I try to kill myself? - Yes Mr. Vidal. Consuelo tried to do the same. Talking about Consuelo, I want to know how many latters have you written to yourself? - I haven't written any. - You have promised to do so. As an experiment. - I assure you I have not written any. - So, you forgot that you have written several letters. If weren't you, then who has it? You were squeezing this in your fist. Who wrote this, Mr Vidal? - Mrs. Vidal, I'm Juan Cervantes from the Bank. - Allow me to introduce Miss Campos to you. - Please to met you, Madame. Oh, miss Campos. What a surprise. I imagined you were older You are too cute to enslave yourself in these vaults I do not work in the vaults. I work at the office. Do you know? I think I should go to the Bank, one of these days. - Will you show everything to me? - Yes, gladly. But now, we should talk about business. - We bring you some papers to sign. - I suppose it is very important. But first, take something with me. I like to know you a little bit more. - Who is this? - It's me, Consuelo. It's your correspondence, Mr. Vidal. Are you okay? Is there something do you need? - No, thank you. - I almost forgot. Someone left this. It wasn't in the mailbox. I found this attached to the door. Did you see someone near or at the door, before you find this? I saw Mrs. Vidal. Miss Campos from the office is now with Madame. - Is this the first time she comes here? - No. She came before with Mr. Cervantes, but you weren't at home. Nicolás. Still not ready? Everyone is waiting for you to show. - Why didn't you call before coming? - Do I have to? Husbands and wives should share the same bedroom. - Wives must do something in this room. - Nick, I wanted tonight was nice. I wanted you had a happy birthday. Why do we always fight? - Maybe if we both try harder... - I have tried enough. I know you need a brother and not a husband. I thought I was Mrs. Vidal... Not miss Vidal. This is what you wanted, brother and sister. Your mother filled your head with nonsense about the behavior of a gentleman. You became a lady to be treated with gloves. In the morning, afternoon and evening. You can take off the gloves. Maybe I do not want to remain a lady. Do you know how many times I tried to act like a man with you? How many times I knoked at your door, and you didn't answer... A man needs a woman. Not a nun. Are you remembering Miss Campos, my dear? Do not pick up broken glass with your dress, Consuelo. Bring me the broom. Why me? You broke the glass, you whip the glass away. - Pick up the glass, Consuelo. - Always giving me orders. Consuelo clean it, collect it. - You're too good to pick up something. - All my life I tried to be honest. And respectable. I will not let everything crash because of a daughter who doesn't know her place. I've had enough with your suicide attempt. Suicide is dishonorable. I could loss my job. Your job? You don't care about me. - I am your daughter, not a whore. - Okay, never forget that. I will pay the broken glasses with your weekly pay. - A toast to the happiness of my husband. - Yes, tomorrow we will die. - You should make a wish. - A birthday wish? I want everybody to be happy. - And none of you to succeed. - That last, you should whisper it. - Now it will not happen. - Sometimes the wishes are carried out by human means. I would like to try your cake, but I don't eat desserts. - May I say goodbye? - Of course Mr. Cervantes. It was a delicious dinner, Mrs. Vidal. Good evening. - Good evening. Don't come with me. I can reach my room. I regret my delay, Mrs. Vidal... I had a very complicated case. I must have missed dinner, but I have arrived in time for your dessert. She is the secreatry of Nicolás... Miss Sinonia Campos. - He's doctor Saluby. - Now I understand the interest of Nicolás in the Bank. I'll give you a birthday present. Relief for your headache. - No to me. Thanks. - I found it, it's beautiful. Cogratulations Mr. Vidal. - What will you do with that poor girl, Nick? - I don't know. Do not forget that this is a party. A toast to a man who has everything. All. Including a year of happiness. - Is the headache gone? - Your interest in patients is very touching. The head injuries are dangerous. Have you feel fainting? Do you have received more letters? Nicolás! You should not have come here. - This is a brazen ... in your own home. And does that matter? She loves you much, Nicolás. If only a man could see through the eyes of a woman... I'm not interested in Eastern philosophy, Sidoni. I came for something else. - You're not going to say no. - Nicholas, return to your bedroom. - Please... You are about to explode. - You're wright. This time everything will be according to my orders. You were the woman from the Chinese Room. - Do you want to act as the faithful wife but unfulfilled, again? - I owe you this paper. - Do you mean "my training"? - If this is how you call it, yes. I love Nicolás, and I know how to show him my love, In every way. Perhaps he wonders where you have learned to be a real woman. Perhaps... Doctor, I owe you. You helped me to understand myself. I have also undertand you. The account is paid. - And closed. - Your husband is not a gentleman. - It's a neurotic clown. - Nick is possesed. And he needs me. - For a very first time, I'm sure to understand him. - What a wonderful dream I regret not being there when you wake up violently. - Explain your words. What do you mean? - It means that your training has not progressed from the initial stage. It moves me how you want to relieve the poor of Nicolás. But Nicolás may help you? That way my dear. Our love started that way. And it have ended the same way, doctor. You're a perfect lady, Muriel. You're a perfect lady, Muriel. From dusk untill down. My kiss was different. It was Different. It was different. Just black and white. Only black and white. Nicolás... Nicolás... The power of suggestion... Mr. Vidal. Help me! Help me! Are you trying to tell me I'm arrested for murder, Lieutenant Alvarez? No... not yet. I don't want to tell that to a man of your size. - Of course. - My work is unpleasant I feel sorry if the murderer is a cobbler or a millionaire who like to watch divers. My cliff is the only with high enough to practice. They train for a dangerous sport. I'm not saying it's not dangerous. There are other dangerous sports. - Sports with worse consequences. - Explain me what are you trying to say. There are men who believe it is a sport, playing with the feelings of the girls. - I completely reject your hints! I have not played with Consuelo. - That was a perfect dive. - Why do you say that Consuelo was the victim of a crime? I can't be sure. is a fact that she tried to kill himself recently. My boss is sure that she was hanged in her room. And the murderer tried to cover everything with the idea of suicide. And then, the murderer hung the body on that tree. My job is to find suspects. And then arrest that person. I regret to say that the first suspect, is you. This is very serious to me. Have you any idea how this will affect my bank? I Don't know anyone who enjoys this, Mr. Vidal. But, that girl shouldn't enjoy her own killing. - Consuelo had a lot of troubles... - Yes, she was pregnant. - How do you know? - She wrote that in the letters that we found in her bedroom. She says clearly that you would be the father of that child, Mr. Vidal. Nick! Nick! Is that detective already gone? Yes. Did he talk to you? Yes, but don't worry, my dear. I said nothing against you, at least I think I did not. What did you say exactly? Not much, "Consuelo is in love with him, and she knew that we hadn't lived as husband and wife" Ah, and that you were very kind to her. And you always a perfect lady... even when you have to bury your husband. - A lady who could not become a mother. - That baby only existed in Consuelo's mind. Like mines, they only exist in my mind. You were not able to procreate. - Despite having tried hard... I did not try anything with Consuelo. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in prison just because you're jealous. What a good show. Nick Vidal in jail! The powerful millionaire. The almighty Nicolas Vidal in a cage ... like an animal. You wanted to do this for a long some, wright? Well, I wanted to do many thinghs for a long time and I don't need you to to achieve them. I will live, in every sense of the word, Nick. All my represed wishes will be fulfilled. I just discovered that I don't need you anymore. I don't hate you. There is no room for such a feeling in this place. Then, why did you tell lieutenant Alvarez that I had taken Cervates Bank letterhead? - I just tell the truth. - But you have convinced him that my letters and Consuelo's are related. I just wanted to help. On that way? Because of your words and my wife's, the police suspect me. They know that Consuelo wrote me some letters, And I went crazy because of those. Mr. Vidal, please calm down. How come? I imagine the newspaper headlines "Nicolás Vidal arrested for murder" I'd rather be dead than spend the rest of my life in jail. Maybe there's a solution, If you can find out who sent you the letters. Who have written and who has killed may be the same person. Of course the self-hypnotism is a very powerful weapon. It may be you who writes the letters. You sent those letters. Is this your revenge, Mr. Cervantes? My only wish is to live happily in this chamber. I found peace, quiet... Your thoughts remind a chinese puzzle. Allow the secret from the chinese room help you. Hallucinogenic mushrooms, right? After this experience, your mind can see clearly. The useless thoughts will vanish, And you will be freed to focus on what's important. Suppose I discover that you wrote the letters - The criminal... - You have to take that risk. You're taking a higher risk when you try to find out the truth. look at your hands, - Mr. Cervantes... The police...! - What! This man must go. He doesn't belong here. At this time he has as much right and need as you. - Don't touch me! - What you said about the police? They're convinced that you have killed her. Did you? Lt. Alvarez says he can arrest you in two days. Then, I have very little time. - You gave me that. - I did not force you to take them. That does not matter because you've taken and you must rest. Why are you fighting the mushrooms? Perhaps, you may dream new dreams... Where did you take this? - Where did you find this? - Come with me. You must lie down... - To hell with those plants. Tell me, who owned this scalpel. I got it from my cousin. And my cousin is the one who gives me the mushrooms as well. - Manuel, he is a doctor. Manuel... Saluby? - Yes. - Aha, Saluby is also been here He could take the letterhead and maybe... Do not go. The effect of the mushrooms can be terrible. Stay here! - What's going to happen to him? - I don't know. - How is Brenda? - Better, but she have mixed anti-sickness pills and alcohol. - Welcome to our party, Nick. - I was told that he had come here. Where's Saluby? Hey, handsome ... this is a party, let's dance! Hey, Nick. What a coincidence to find you here. You wrote those letters! You murdered Consuelo. - Stop! Nick! - You have used Consuelo to send the letters! - And then you killed her! - Stop, Nick... please! - You're excused! - From what? I excuse your vulgarity, your bad mood and your bad manners. This dinner was your idea, pretend you're a gentleman. I have never pretended to be a gentleman. I have not invited you as a gesture of friendship. One of you will take my place in prison. All of you, my friends have worked to portray me as a criminal. One of you has been sending letters, and police believe that person and the criminal are the same criminal. - What do you think, Miss Campos? - I wouldn't know what to say. Mr. Vidal? What formality! Why not just call him Nick? I suppose that you call him Nick in intimate situations. - In situations such as you and your doctor, Madame? - I just know Dr. Saluby When did you became my husband's lover? Six moths? A full year? More than two years, Mrs. Vidal. But he would not have looked at me if he was happy with you. If you had been his wife, he would not have needed me. You gave him nothing. I just give him what he needed. Yes, until little Consuelo have intruded. Did you kill her because of that? I met Consuelo until I first came here. But you knew her feelings for Nicholas, is not it? Yes, I did. He told me about the letters. And you heard that she wanted to talk to Nick after the dinner. And then, you felt displaced. And what about you? You know nothing about Nick and me that night. But you already knew about Nick and Consuelo. And you heard the same I did, that they would meet after dinner. - Do you think I can be jealous of a maid? - In the Convent you were also known as a jealous woman. And you, you had to have this mistress and the other. - Consuelo was not enough for you. - You were jealous of Consuelo, admit it. Not so jealous enough to kill. I didn't write those letters... with your business letterhead. - Are you accusing me of having written the letters? - You had the paper. Let me remind you that there are also letterhead paper here. You don't own the bank and we do. Besides, you have talked to Consuelo the night she was murdered. I saw her crying in the garden. She was so nervous. I tried to calm her. Yes, maybe Consuelo saw you when you handed a letter... and you had to help her to "calm" for good. - That was your plan... take your Bank? - I am a gentleman. I've never been accused of a crime before. There's always a first time. And you? You'd come to my Chinese room so many times. 18 sheets have disappeared. - You stole those leaves. Me? I only deliver the mushrooms. I give you "Ganghes dreams, Juan. - My cousin, the greedy, also steals the stationery of our old business. How many times did you "treatment" to Consuelo? - Much less time than you. - What kind of treatment did you give her? I suggest we all move on to the lounge. This dinner, hosted by Nicholas, seems like a funeral. - I'm sure you prefer to dine on my corpse. - I Always knew you were a clown. Every day you talk more like Dr. Saluby, my dear. - You're not helping much. - I do not think you need any help. - As I've said, you were deeply in love with your husband. - My husband is acting like a madman. He is full of reproaches and accusations. He has fun watching how we blame each other. It is perfectly normal, he is risking his own skin. Would you like to see how easily I control your husband? Is this another of your treatments, doctor? Remember that you should wait a while, after I was sent to jail. before becoming Mrs. Saluby. - Do not act like an idiot. I will not do it again, Muriel. That is over! I want to know exactly how was the treatment of Consuelo. A reasonable request. I'll try to answer it correctly. And in common terms. Could you sit down, Nicolas? Ladies and gentlemen ... And I hope you will forgive me for using the following expression: Allow me to present the main attraction of the circus One of our best clowns will attempt an act He's Going to explain to the mob, the kind of treatment applied to the, recently deceased, Consuelo Sidoni, Do you want to miss doctor's main attraction? No, I don't want. I have nothing to do with this. Sidoni, I will speak as clear as I can. You have paid your ticket with this. Don't come and say now, that Consuelo didn't know about us. Have a sit. Enjoy the show! - Are you ready, Nicolás? - Of course, You may start, doctor. Everyone here knows that Consuelo had an unbalanced personality. To find the root of his mental problems Problems similar to yours, Nicolas I used hypnotherapy treatment. And Nicholas knows that hypnotherapy is the treatment of the mind through hypnosis. Mute fears. Dilute the irrational with the aid of suggestion. You have to relax your muscles. Step back to a moment in your childhood. You went to the field trip. You will lie on the hay... Empty your mind, but focus on floating clouds. Your eyes are closed now. And you can not open. You can only hear the sound of my voice. Nicolás... go to the writing desk and write a new letter, to yourself. - I see that you have become a very good doctor. - I appreciate the compliment. I did not say that to flatter you. While your served him in his bank, and anxiously waited for spent the night in your chinese room Hypnotherapy began to be used in large scale, and for the best doctors. But the best doctors don't use it to manipulate. Remember that Vidal family robbed Cervantes. We must recover what is ours. Now, Nicolás, Put that letter in your pocket. Nicholas, forget what is written in the letter. Return to the couch. Lay down. I want you to sleep deeply for thirty minutes Wake up, following my orders. Then, discover the letter and wonder who wrote it. sleep, Nicholas. Sleep... I think I need a drink, come to the balcony. Okay, wake up. Open your eyes, Nicolás. - I had a weird dream. - What kind of dream? Well, I dreamed that I came to your office, Saluby. And I found this! The truth is here, in the Consuelo's file You hypnotized and ordered her to deliver the letters that you wrote. Manuel! Was it you? Of course I wrote those letters, to help Nicolás. I can state that, calmly, in court It is not a crime to write letters. I only did my duty. I tried to avoid that Vidal, with the help of suggestion did what he have done. Let's call'em "warning letters" And if he were wise man, he would have voluntarily placed in a madhouse I advised Mrs. Vidal to intern him in the asylum. But that should have been before he hurt someone or commit suicide. I would say that my cousin is much more suspicious than I am. Did any of you see Consuelo alive, after Cervantes talked to her? Yes, her father did. After talking with me, Consuelo said she was going to wait for her father. She was scared to death because she had something to say. My God wants me to say the truth. That night, she told me she was going to have a child, I was overwhelmed with that misfortune. With that... shame. I use my hands around her neck I shook her violently. Yes, I was strangling her. I was so furious. But I didn't kill her. Let miss Campos confirm this. She was walking to her room when I left Consuelo's room. and she heard my daughter weeping. - Is that true? - No. But, miss Campos, you have entered my daughter's room. Pilar have seen you there. I need Pilar in this room. While we all wait for Pilar, would you like to change your story? Ok! I went to her room. - But I didn't kill her! - Ok, you should be talking about your shared lover, I guess. - Where are you going? - I'm calling police. As in the movies. don't you think so? Do not worry, my dear. We will all be present at your murder trial. Believe me, I didn't kill her. I wasn't! Then, why did you go to her bedroom? I wanted to ask her for that hoof. The hoof gave you during dinner. I was desperate. I... I tried to find Mr. Cervantes, but I failed. For that reason I decided to question Consuelo. I had to know how she knew. You... You said it! You saw my foot in the Chinese Room. Damn you. I hate you. Nasty Doctor. You told her to give me that hoof. Yes she told me that, to you, it was very funny. Yes, she laughed when she told me so. And that made you angry, wright? And strangled her because she laughed at you. No! You have to believe, Nicolás! You have to! The lady is unhappy! Everyone is unhappy! Well, keep all of you protesting. And pretending. Eat each other! Nicolás is not going to listen anymore. Tomorrow, my friends... The police will arrest me. The funny thing is that I will prove who killed Consuelo! You're drunk! You say nonsense. I'm drunk, Saluby. But I find something! Just after returning from your office, I stopped in Consuelo's bedroom. The proof was there! But now it's here... safe in my pocket. - What proof, Nicolás? I bet everyone is dying to know. Everyone wants to know. But you all have to wait until tomorrow! - What the hell happened here? I told you I was going to prove who is the murderer. But she proved that by trying to kill me. Out. I want you all to stay away! Don't look at me! Out of here! All of you! - Please don't look at me! - Why did you do that, Muriel? For revenge. Yes, I hate you. Why I should not hate you? Do you know what I felt when the maid said she was going to have your baby? And you thought that was true? Mrs. Vidal... she said coldly, I carry your husband's son inside me. From this day, he will be only mine. You will not have anything. Was it true, Nicolás? We were married. But ... You were never mine. T H E E N D Subtitled by Spinal ******************
