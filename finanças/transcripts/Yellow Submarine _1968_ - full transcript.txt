NARRATOR: Once upon a time... or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called... Pepperland. 80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay, or lie, I'm not too sure. ♪♪ {Brass band playing) (Wicked laughter) Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched. Right, Max? - Yes, Your Blueness. - What?! We Meanies only take no for an answer. Is that understood, Max? No, Your Blueness. That's better. Are the troops in readiness? No, your Blueness. - The Bonkers? - No. - Clowns? - No. - Snapping Turks? - No. - Anti-music missiles? - No. - The dreadful Flying Glove? - No. Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes bluely! Fire!

(Explosions) LORD MAYOR: 4 scores and 32 bars ago, - Our forefathers... - Our quartet? - And foremothers... - Another quartet? made it in this yellow submarine... - What, that little thing? - To Pepperland. Climb aboard, Young Fred. But, sir, I can't even make my soap float. I'm appointing you Lord Admiral. Lord Admiral? In that event, yes. Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help! Where should I go?

PAUL: It's not a goldfish bowl. RINGO: Just a big glass bowl, then. - It's blue glass. - It must be from Kentucky. RINGO: There's something inside. JOHN: Four fellas. GEORGE: What are they doing there? PAUL: They're not having a ball, that's for sure. RINGO: It can't be. GEORGE: It's us. - But we're here. - It's Sgt. Pepper's... - Lonely... - Hearts Club... RINGO: Band. GEORGE: The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here... I think the theory put forward by Einstein could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs... GEORGE: John! - ... beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper... GEORGE: John! - George? - How do we get them out? - Break the glass. - We can't. It's Beatle-proof. - Nothing is Beatle-proof. Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it. - No, I haven't. - Have a look in your pocket. I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if... Yeah, it still works. Ringo, we take back all we said. You're a genius, a sheer genius. I know, I know, I know. - Like coloured telly. - Like crystal. They're decanting. PAUL: Hello, brother. RINGO: Yeah, without a doubt. - We're the spitting image of each other. - Golly, yeah. I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality. - Yes, I'm the alter-ego man. - And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the skirmish must we hence. Shall we hence? Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge! (Trumpet) (Shouting and screaming) JOHN: We're surrounded. RINGO: Nice dog, though.

I think you'd better inquire of the guards, for when I was captured, they took all my cards. Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. - The whole world's being attacked. - What do you want me to do? Do you recommend fisticuffs versus the guard? Oh, guard! Blue Meanio! Left to the nostril, right uppercut, right to the eyebrow, left to the gut. (Giggling) Jeremy! Come on, Ringo! Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now! My kingdom for a horse! (Sobbing) I think I'll tear him up into little pieces. He does, does he? Yes, I think I'll make a blueburger out of him. Ha-ha, I don't care what you think. You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that. He does in truth seem quite annoyed, some reference material before I'm destroyed. Where ground is soft most often grows, Arise, arise, arouse, a rose. A rosy nose? Speak your last piece! Peace, peace, supplant the doom and the gloom. Turn off what is sour, turn into a flower and bloom, bloom. Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, bloom, bloom... (Screaming) (Laughing) First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, - I knew he was somebody. - You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go mingle. - What do you say? - Max? Your Blue... I mean, your Newness! It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go? Argentina? Are you with us? Will you join? - Shall we? - No! (Shrieking) Yes, your Newness! - Yes, Max... JEREMY: Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring, A true, universal, euphonious thing. In genders embracing and chasing of blues, the very best word for the whole world to use. Ha-ha! Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of Happiness.

I gave the rest to Jeremy. What can he do with half a hole? Fix it to keep his mind from wandering. Hey. Look at John, will you? What's the matter, John, love? Blue Meanies? Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre. There's only one way to go out. - How's that? - Singing. One...two...three...four!
