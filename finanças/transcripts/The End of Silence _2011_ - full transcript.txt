THE END OF SILENCE Theo? You need to check on the problem with the water. Jean! Jean! Mom is up! Jean, come on! I'm leaving in five. Yeah, I got it! Jean! Go wake him up, I've had enough! What's the point? Come on Jean, Mom's waiting for you. Don't be a pain in the ass, I'm coming! Come on, stop messing around. Let's go! -Benji? -Do we have any sugar? Are you going to pick me up at soccer after school? Yes, I'll be there. What is he doing? Jean? -Jean? -Too bad, I'm leaving. See you tonight. Yeah. Why haven't you kicked him out? He isn't even trying anymore. -Where would he go? -He's an adult, it's not your problem. No, it's not our problem... -Get up! -Get out, damn it, leave me alone! Get out of here! Son of a bitch! -Son of a bitch! -Don't talk to him like that! -What are you going to do about it? -Don't touch me! Leave me alone! Let me go, don't touch me, damn it! Don't touch me! Get off! Don't touch me! Don't look at him. Don't look at him. Damn it! Not this time! You'll regret it, sons of bitches! You'll regret it! Besides, we're dead! Do you understand that? Damn it! Luc! -What are you doing? What is this? -What? Get off! What? What? -What, what? -What do you want? Asshole! You asshole! Don't waste your time! Let him go. Have you calmed down? Come on, come on. Hey, Luc! -My father's in the shop. -No, don't bother him. Is your brother here? Jean, Nils is here for you! -Hey, Jean! -Hey, I need you for a hunt. Go on, get in. Have you seen his face? So? What happened to you? -How about this hunt. Who's coming? -Eight beaters and twenty hunters. If we want a good hunt, we'll need to get at least 15 animals. -Hey! -Did you have a good trip? Yeah! Excuse me, do you have a light? Do you want a drink? Do you have water? Are you okay, Jean? Here, this is for you. Go on! -I'm not wearing this. -What? You're joking, I got it just for you! Come on, try it on! Take that off. Here. Come on! Here. Let me see. You look like a boss! You're stylish! You can't dodge punches, but you look good! Put this on. You look great! And with the gun tomorrow, you'll see- What's that? The stick is just fine! He's beating tomorrow. Come on! "He's one of us, he has drunk his drink like the rest of us! He's a drunkard, you can see it in his face!" There! Come on, have a drink! Is that good? -I'm going, I've had enough! -What? No, no. Why? -I'm leaving. -No, you'll sleep here. What's wrong? Hey, I need you, you hear? I'll call your mother and check. You can come over any time, you know. Yeah, yeah. I know. -Can you open the door, please? -I'll be right there. -Are you okay? -Yes. Coffee. Want to play? Give me the hose. -Is that good? -Yeah. So what are you doing, staying or leaving? I'm leaving. It would be nice if you stayed a few days. Hey, wait. -Do you want it? -Can I? Do you like it? Give me a kiss! -See you later! -See you later. It's a very good scope. You adjust the focus there. You can aim up to 200 metres away, easily. I told you no guns. Never do that again, you're not his mother, understand? Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Tally ho! Tally ho! Tally ho! Hallo! Tally ho! Hallo! Lower your gun! You never leave the group! She's small, but pretty. Pick her up! Hold it! -Baptized! -Hey, what are you doing? -Hold it, for God's sake! -Baptized! Well done! Theo? Did you hear any thunder? No. Maybe it was a tree that fell. Is it the breakers? I'll go see. No! Hurry, hurry! Help me with the damn hose! Damn it! Come on, I need more! Come on! Stay back! Come on, pull, more! -Stay back! -No! Benji! -Does it reach? -Not enough pressure. Keep pulling! Theo! Benji, Benji! Benji! Benji! -Where were you? -What's your problem? You smell like gas. -Did you do it? -That's enough. Stop. You're crazy! Was it you? You're getting on my nerves. That's enough, okay? That's enough, Jean! -Let me see your hand. -What? -Give me your hand! -Are you happy now? I'm going to beat him up. What are you doing? That's all I have, leave it alone! Give me that, damn it! Get out of here, leave us alone! You think I burned it? Yeah, it was me! Where were you? -I can't. -Come on, please. For God's sake, what are you doing, Jean? Damn it! Come on! Come on, you can do it! Come on, go up the hill! Jean? Jean? Stop! One new message. Nils? We've had some trouble. He burned the car. I don't know what to do. He isn't a child anymore. We have to speak to him together. I can't take it anymore, Nils. Time has passed so quickly... Why the hell was this in the car? The tank was full! The light was on and I didn't want to go down to the station. It's petrol, our car takes diesel. You're completely insane. Jean! Jean? Why did you say he smelled like gas? It's a mess in here. My God! It should be full, right? There's no water flowing in. Maybe the drain is blocked, higher up. It's filled with dirt. Damn! Luc? Luc? You can go back. It's fine, I'll be there soon. How are you, Luc? Take this off, you're soaked. What is Theo doing? -Why isn't he here? -He's coming. -Here you are. -Thanks. -Has Benji done his homework? -He's doing it now. Come have a drink! -Not very talkative, is he? -Come sit with us, Luc. Here. You haven't seen Jean either? Here. You have a problem with your well? The drain was blocked. I saw the car, there isn't much left, is there? What's going on with Jean? Jean didn't start the fire. -Why are you here, Nils? -What happened to his eye? -What does that have to do with you? -Oh, so now you're talking? You should go now, things are already complicated enough as it is. Didn't you hear him? We told you to get lost. Rude! You know he has a gun? Yes, he has a gun! And I hope you weren't the one who hit him! What's wrong? Nothing more to say? Do you still want me to go? You gave him a gun? You're completely crazy! He took it, I'm sorry. I made a mess, I... What are you doing? What are you doing? This stays between us. We'll wait for him together. Theo, what are we going to do with him? We'll see tomorrow. Stay! What did you tell him about me? What did you say to Jean? You should have been here earlier. Do whatever you want, I'm leaving. -Give me the keys. -You're not going anywhere! You want me to stay? He wants me to stay. You can go to bed. I'll stay here. Jean! What are you doing? Stop! It's over! Enough, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shooting, damn it! Let me go! Stop, stop! Is this about the car? It wasn't you! Nils, tell him! Nils! Nils! -Stop! -Stop, Nils! Let him go, for God's sake! Stop! Give him to me, I've got him. I've got him, I've got him! Nils! Nils! Subtitling: Hiventy
