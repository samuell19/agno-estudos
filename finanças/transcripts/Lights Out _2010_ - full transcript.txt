- Hi - Hi, come in. So she came? That's good for you. There's a girl throwing up in your parents room. Frederic? Do you have a condom? Here, I won't need them for the night. Damn it. I flirted with her all night and you're the one who'll get her. Shall we go in a quieter place? - What? Don't you want to go upstairs? - I don't feel well. I'm... Shall we go out? - It's a bit cold, but if you want it's OK. Are you OK? - I have to throw up. I have to walk. Can you talk to me? - What should I talk about? Maybe about your band. Well, we're gonna part. It's a shame. - No, we couldn't understand each other. We even couldn't find a name. Do you mind if I take a piss? No. Could you sing something? the silence blocks me. What's wrong? - There's someone in the bushes. Alive? - I don't think so. Ten days earlier Hi. D'you have football training tonight? - Yes, why? Just like that. Did you calm down, Hulk? You're late again, Jeremie. - Sorry. Do you want to talk about the other day? No. All right. Hurry up, we're waiting. Back to the center. Hi, Legrand. Hello, Madame Legrand. Good luck my dear. I'll pick you up around 6.30 - Thanks mum. Your mother is sexy. - Shut up, Rabier. Why didn't you get a cast? - There was no need. I heard you did that alone. - Yes. Like a dumb. - Shut up man. Why do they call you Hulk in the club? Well, see you later. Mister Legrand is back. Hello. Take a place. Cardon? - Present. Colboc? - Present. Duquesnoy? - Present. I thought you would come back tomorrow? I came earlier, it was too boring with my father. You have no cast. Sure it's not all an act? - She's cute. Don't you have something to color? Take care, I'm the one who took all your homework. Not your best friend Freddy the weasel. Don't you think he has a weasel face? Certainly a rat sex too. Attention please. Salic? - Present. Van den Broeck? Weil? Still no news from Simon Werner? Who's going to correct yesterday's exercise? You should come, you'll have amazing muscles then. Jeremie, should I bring your homework to your house? It's a delivery service. - Asshole, there's a lot that's all. At home, that's nice. - OK, tomorrow? Cool, thanks. She's really hot on you. It's not my case. So there's nothing new about Werner? His parents first thought he ran away. So the cops searched in stations and airports. Then they found blood in the physics classroom. Apparently it's his blood. God she's sexy Alice Cartier. - You're right. Did you know she left Simon? - Did she? Who do you think you are? - Cool down, I'm with a handicapped. Give me the carrots. Some cake? - No, bring me an apple. Diego Maradona is back. How long? - The crutches? One month, I'm disgusted. No sport for one month. - No sex either. Exactly when Punky comes to his place for the homework. It's to study. Not sure I could get an erection with her. She's not Alice Cartier, for sure. Do you have news from Werner? I heard he left because she parted. - They weren't together anymore? Everybody knows that. - I never understood why they were together, he's strange. Girls like the strange attitude. - You like Alice Cartier, don't you? She's hot, for sure. Don't you think so Jeremie? It's a pain in the ass that Werner got her. Rabier got her too. That's not respecting women, Rabier. Everything all right? Now you don't have to do the gym at least. Yes, but what should I do meanwhile? - Check out the girls playing volleyball. Doing well, stalker? - What? What are you doing here in front of our changing room. Hey, Rabier. Stalking is not good. - I wasn't looking at her. Liar. - That's bad. Perverse. He doesn't take a shower and watches the girls. Hi ladies. Have you heard about Rabier's father? Grammont saw Simon giving a blowjob to a tall guy in the physic classroom. Who was it? -A tall guy with a white dress in the physics class. It can only be Rabiers father. - And you're sure he was giving a blowjob? Apparently. - And Grammont is experienced in blowjobs. Giving a blowjob is already disgusting, but Rabier... isn't even worth it. It's disgusting, and he's really not Mel Gibson. Honestly I would prefer to suck Mel Gibson then Rabier. I always knew you were a bit homosexual. - Yes, that's it. Talking about him... Enjoy your meal guys. Sorry, it's the traffic. - No problem, I could meet your dad. Damn it. Sorry. - Hello. Hi, my love. You saw their concert last year? - Of course. Here, that's the math and physics. I copied the bio and philosophy. - Thanks, it's really cool. It's nothing. - No it's really kind. You weren't obliged to do that. It's because I think you're nice. And cute. Really? Didn't you notice? - No. I'm just kidding, you're not my type. You should see your face. It's all in the red map. If something's missing just ask me. It's nice at your place. Hi. What's wrong? - I fell. You fell? - Yes. Shut up man. - Well, the truth is sometimes banal. Everything's fine, Jean-Baptiste? - Yes, thank you. The presence list. It's still on for Saturday? What happened, you fell?.. Of course it's still on. - He's 18, it's a reason to party. You won't give up partying because of your leg. You never dance anyway. I can invite Alice Cartier if you want? - You don't even know her. It's a good occasion. - You're gonna make fools out of us. Is Laetitia Salic absent? Does someone know something? Van den Broeck? Weil? And Werner. Bullshit, what should Simon do in Morocco? Buy some hashish? I just heard that from Boisseau. - But he's not the one who saw him. My dad also read something in the journal, that he would be there for a drug traffic story. Which journal? - The local. Well, that's not the New York Times. - Didn't he play in the soccer club with you? At the beginning, but he left. Why do they call you Hulk there? - Aren't they Punky's parents? I think so. - What are they doing here? Legrand, the director wants to talk with you. What are Starsky and Hutch doing here? - For Laetitia Salic. Nothing new since yesterday afternoon. What did they say? - Not much. They asked when she left my place, what she came for and if she seemed strange. Punky always seems strange. - Her parents looked really worried. Maybe a crazy decided to kill everyone from our class. And why would he? - I don't know... He just decided to kill us all, there are a lot of crazy guys like him. Read the news guys. - That only happens in films. There are just two persons who disappeared, one weird guy and a crazy girl. And Simon's blood in the classroom? Yeah, just laugh. Jeremie, it's still on for Saturday, your party? -Of course. It's gonna be great, alcohol, joints, techno and girls. I'm not sure if I can come. My parents don't want me to go out. And I stop it with the band. How many times have you played? two or three? Three, and we already had no battery. It's a mess, man. D'you come or not? - It will depend of the physics note. A 5,25. And I even studied this time. It's ridiculous to give quarter of notes. What a pity for the party. What time does your mother come? In an hour. It's shitty to wait. - The bus doesn't wait, see you. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for my mother. Don't hang around in the corridors. Rabier's father is really strange, he looks guilty. Yes, for sure. Here's Alice Cartier. If you don't invite her, I'll do it. I count to three. One, two... Hi Jeremie? - Hi Alice. You did that at soccer? You know where the trainer lives? - Yves? Yes, why? No reason. It's the last house in the rue Pasteur, in the Marie Curie, before the woods. Thanks. By the way... I'm having a party tonight. If you want to come by, you're welcome. Since when do you talk with Alice Cartier? - I know her, it's no miracle, stop it. One day you'll ask forgiveness for all your lies. He's crazy In case my parents ask, I'm sleeping at your place and we're studying. A Saturday evening, you study at a friends house?.. Your parents are dumb. No they just trust me. - That's what I say. Silence please. Those who are by the windows, please pull the curtains. Someone's missing? It's Jean-Baptiste Rabier, no? Someone knows if he's sick? No? We start a new chapter today. We're going into the heart of mankind's anatomy. Last time we saw the connection between organs and... Shit, I'm happy not to be in your class. Rabier is certainly sick. - Or he got killed by the crazy killer. We can go and check. - So we meet his father, no thanks. You're afraid he catches you? - At this hour Rabier's father has a class. And his mother? His mother is dead. - I didn't know. She worked here too and died in strange circumstances. The murderer was never found. That's just stories. - Maybe that's why Rabier is so strange. Her death must have been a traumatic shock. - Maybe he stuffed her. Shall we go? Jean-Baptiste, are you there? Nice decoration. - A real psychopath house. Let's go upstairs? What are you doing here? - Shit. You again. Sorry, the door was open and... - Enough Pierre-Alain. Keep your explanations for the principle. Back to school now. I'm sure he's hiding something. Don't mess it up. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him. Cool. Isn't it strange to give a party when three people disappeared in our class? Laetitia just broke out, that's all. - They're three and have no connections between them. Stop it, I'm sure there's a logical explanation. Do you want to stay home alone? You're 18 now, the show must go on. Shut up... There's something special with your class. They all disappear. Our classroom must be built on an ancient Indian cemetery, as in Poltergeist. That's in Amityville. And others use our classroom. I think there's a link with the number of our room. C2 is like double C. Christophe Cardon. Yes, a typical serial killer case. Did you see that guy, he's two foot tall and 40 kilos.. I think it's one of your classmate's vengeance. Could be Rabier, but he disappeared too. - We don't treat him badly. It's the one who lives in the teachers house? He's really weird. Papa takes his students. Strange family. Yes, it quite a strange family. But remember the son is one of the victims. You're all right? Did you hear about the soccer trainer? The cops called him for Simons case. No way. You're all right? Hello. Hi Clara, it's nice of you to show up. Want to drink something? Is there Malibu? - We have everything. Didn't Alice come with you? - No, but she'll come soon. What's that? - You don't know that? It's mythic. Hi. - Hi, come in. Is she here? That's good for you. There's a girl throwing up in your parents room. I have it under control. What? I can't hear anything. What did you want to say? - It's nice that you came. There was no need to cross the whole room just to say that. Why were you so pissed off during the soccer game yesterday? Were you there? I don't know... Will the trainer come too? - Yves? No. He got arrested. Did he? Who is it? - I don't know, no idea. What's wrong? They found a body in the woods? - A body? We' re not sure, but he didn't move. Was it a man, a woman? - A man. I think. Was it Simon? I don't know. What do we do? - We should call the cops. Clara, show us where it was. - Don't you have a torchlight? In the garage. But I also think we should call the cops. Then do it, you can't come with your leg anyway. So? Is Alice here? - She was with you. We don't know... - You, left her alone? She took another way. But the cops will find her. You're really dumb. - Fuck off, man. Simon? Simon wake up. I have to go. Where would you go? - Maybe to see my father. Where does he live? - Near Montpelier. There's a big garden, it's great for Thibault. Would you take me with you? Don't' worry, I'm not gone yet. For that I should earn a lot. I'm gonna say hello to Yves. Calm down, Jeremie. Asshole! Stop it. You-come with me. You - go out. It's all right. I understood nothing about philosophy. I finished it in the bus. You say that but you always have good notes. - No really, and what a shitty subject. 'Can you represent reality without idealizing it?' Did you talk about Schopenhauer? - Why? His principle of 'representation of my shitty world' I always put it on when I can. I understand nothing. I can't even write his name. Did your mother help you? - No, she doesn't give a shit. She certainly thinks I'll make it on my own. Who's that blond guy in the last class? - That narrows it down! Blue eyes, charming. - It's getting more precise. He's in Simons class. - It's Jeremie Legrand. He lives close to me You like him? No, I just saw him flipping out during a match, it was quite strange. Is it fine with Simon? - Yes, why? It looks like you're on the prowl. Come, we could study the math together? - No, I have to go shopping with my mother. She wants to buy a dress. - That's great. See you tomorrow then. You scared me to death, daddy. - Sorry, sweet heart. Can't you knock? - I tried. What is it? - Dinner is ready. Amazing. - Don't make your mother wait please. What a dumb-ass. You're all right? - Yes. Shall we go? You're fine? It won't start and it's just been repaired. Come with me, I'll bring you home. Thanks. Alice? If you want I could bring you home again another day. Please quiet. You're back, you feel better? - Yes Here are your dissertations. It's not brilliant. Tissier, 2. You're all right? Did you know? - What? About Simon. He disappeared four days ago. Why didn't you call me? - I thought you knew. Alice Cartier, 14. Not bad, could be better. But still better then the others. There's an exam soon, you know that? He just ran away. He couldn't stand his mother anymore. She's completely depressed. He went to his fathers in Montpelier. I'm sure. It's strange he hasn't told anyone. When you run away, you don't say it. Otherwise you get caught. What does he do? You're staring? What are doing here, loser. He's disgusting. - It's Rabier's son, the physic teacher. What does the police do at school? So? - The parents of Laetitia Salic, she disappeared. - Is it related to Simon? No idea. But she was in his class. It's frustrating not to know. Miss Werner? I'm Alice, a friend of Simon. He didn't tell you about me? Sorry to disturb, but is there any news? Not yet. D'you think he ran away? - I don't know Sorry, I'm tired. Yes sorry, bye. Yves? - Yes trainer. I saw Simon giving him money the other day. Money? - It's strange no? I'm sure he had some deals, that's why Simon left. There's Jeremie. Hi Jeremie? - Hi, Alice. Did that happen at soccer? D'you know where the trainer lives? - Yves? Yes, why? Just like that. It's the last house in rue Pasteur, in the Marie Curie area, before the woods. Thanks. By the way. I'm having a party tonight, if you want to come by you're welcome. You know the Marie Curie area? - Yes, do you want to go there? Yes, you'll come with me won't you? It's weird here. Is it here? I think that's it - Are you sure? It's the last house before the woods. What do we do now? - I don't know. Someone's coming. That's him. I really don't trust him. We should call the cops. I'm sure he knows where Simon is. He might come to the party. You think so? I'm sure he knows something.. Which way did you take? I think here on the right. You don't remember. Clara, do you know? Not really. - You don't know where you went? It was dark. - It makes no sense to continue. Let's just split up. Clara, you come with me. You go to the right and you take the path. It's better I come with you. Luc, come on. What's that? Must be an animal. What the fuck? - Sorry, I thought. I can't believe it. - Watch out. Come back, you're gonna loose yourself. What a dumb-ass. Frederic? I'm gonna sleep at a friends tonight. That's good. You know what the cleaner found in the school? I don't know. - Just guess. I don't know, a syringe? No, a condom. And a used one. Enjoy your meal. It's unbelievable. Can you imagine... During the classes, there are students who have sex. Or teachers.. At least they protect themselves. And you... - We don't need to have that talk. I know everything about that. I read the brochures you left in the living room. As well as the condoms you left in the bathroom. It's all right, thanks. And I'm not the one who used that condom. Vegetables? - Please. Hi, Jean-Baptiste. Hi Simon. We were waiting for you to start. Hi, Grammont. Where did you buy your pullover? - Really funny. Charlotte wants to buy the same one. That's not kind. - What is it? He doesn't want to tell us where he bought his pullover. Thanks for holding us a place Rabier. He looks happy. The girls are laughing about his pullover - I really don't understand why. It's fine, enough. - He's pissed off now. - Grammont is gonna steal your girl. - She's not my girlfriend. Look how it goes, Rabier, if you don't want to end alone with your hand. I don't think Grammont is interested in girls. Why do you say that? Because he just doesn't like girls. - Is he gay or what? Bullshit. I saw him kiss Julien Moisel yesterday evening. Seriously? I always thought he's strange - Strange doesn't mean gay. So Loisel is gay too? - Apparently yes. That's something. Well, it's not a sickness. - But it's good for you, Kama. Hi dad. - Hi Jean-Baptiste, are you done? There's one missing, could you look in class 202? Calm down. You're gonna regret it. No, there's nothing. Mysterious. See you. So you had your kick and now you leave? Stop talking like in a movie. - Stop acting like an asshole. Hi dad. - Did you eat something? Yes, there's pizza in the oven. Simon Werner, is he in your class? - Yes, why? His mother has no news from him since Thursday. Quiet. Are there absentees today, besides Simon. Does anyone have news from Mr. Legrand? - Yes, he must leave the hospital tomorrow. What happened? - He broke his leg playing football. How did he do that? - Alone, like a dumb-ass. Be serious now. We do the full version. The last test was specially bad. That's nice. It's not full but it's nice. Hi, Legrand. Hello Madame Legrand. Good luck my dear. I'll pick you up around 6.30 Your mother is sexy. - Shut up, Rabier. So you don't take a shower, Rabier? Disgusting, Rabier. Think of the others. Very funny. Wait, Jean-Baptiste. I want to talk with you - Why? I'll change within five minutes, just wait. Are you enjoying watching us? What do you do here in front of our changing room. Stalker. So, Rabier. It's not good to stare like that. I wasn't staring. That's bad. Pervert. Good luck. You all right, dad? Grammont saw them: Simon Werner sucking Rabier. No I really didn't. - Disgusting image. He's gonna get fired, the old Rabier. - No doubt. You heard for Rabier? Rabier is said to have killed Simon, to that he doesn't talk. That's bullshit. - I don't believe that. All right? Yes. Have you eaten? I'm not hungry. I'm gonna cook something, sure you want nothing? All right, Jean-Baptiste? - Yes, thanks. The presence list. Did you fell or what? Quiet. Duquesnoy? Fleury? Guerin? Legrand? Meyer? Rabier? Rastelli? Salic? Is Laetitia Salic absent? Does anyone know if she's sick? Van den Broeck? Weil? Werner? We continue where we were last time. Everybody's looking for you? - I don't care. What did you want to tell me? Did you see us the other day with Frederic? Just wanted you not to tell anyone about it? Now it's not important, as it's over. - Is it? I think so. I made a mistake. You can see everything from here. Look at that bastard Grammont. You should kick his ass. He's really an asshole. Telling all these disgusting stories about your father. I can't understand that you haven't kicked his ass. It's really cowardly to do nothing. How do you know that these are stories? - What? How do you know Grammont is full of shit? Sorry I'm really sorry. Where are you going? - I don't know. Can you open all the doors? - Nearly all. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for my mother. - Don't hang around in the corridors. What a great local. I didn't know there was a piano here. You come here often? - Yes, sometimes. To play piano. Sometimes I sleep here. So you run away then? - Not really. My father thinks I'm not invited enough by my friends. So from time to time, I say I sleep at a friends house, and I spend the night here. It's a nice place. And you, where did you sleep yesterday? Nowhere, I just walked. Will you play me something later? Shit. Laetitia, my watch didn't ring. Shit. Does anyone know if Jean-Baptiste Rabier is ill? We'll start a new chapter today. So we take a day break? It's good not to see some of these faces for one day. So what happened with Frederic? I brought Jeremie his homework. You know him and Frederic are neighbors. So I went to his house. I never went there before, but I just wanted to see him. I was afraid of his reaction, but I couldn't back out. And when he saw me He got pissed off... He said I had nothing to do there. That I was crazy. It made me mad... He caught me by the arm and... I started screaming and insulting him. I called him all sorts of names and hit him. I don't know what I did. You did well. You think so? Aren't you afraid of ladies who can fight? What's that? What are they doing? Is it the police? Maybe looking for Simon Look at that... Shall we take a look? Do you think someone lives here? It's great. I'll come and live here. Simon has the same lighter. Maybe he came to hide here. We could just wait and see Shall we roll one? You all right? Shit, it's really late. Maybe it's time to go back to civilization. And I'm really hungry Me too. It was nice here with you. And if you want to talk about your father and all.. You know you can talk to me. - You know... I said that because I was pissed off. My father never touched me... He's not like that. I'm sorry. - You're really an asshole. I'm sorry. There's really no one to trust. Laetitia? Laetitia? Frederic? Simon, the dinner is ready? All right? I want to talk to you. I'm asking myself what to do next year. I'm not sure to be good enough for high school... And at university I'd just do nothing isn't it better to talk about it with your class teacher? Mister Leclerq? Sorry, but he's really a loser. I wanted your opinion. Because I trust you. You were my teacher last year. You should have given me this work yesterday. I know but I really couldn't. - I told you I don't accept late works. So you're gonna give me a zero? Calm down, Grammont. - It's the first time it happens. My parents will kill me. - That's enough. Sorry. Would you take me with you? I'm not gone yet. I should save a lot for that. I'm gonna say hello to Yves. Hi Simon. - How much is it? One to one Here's your money for the video game. It's no hurry. - It's a great game. Where are you? - I can't pass the tunnel. Is there a secret path? - It's not easy to find. Come by my house I'll show you. Cool down, Jeremie. - Stop that Come with me. Hi, Simon. Grammont has a problem? - Yes. Because of school? - No, he's in love with... someone. He doesn't know who to talk about it. You're the heart doctor now? Hi, Clara. For you, Simon. All right? I came to say it's over. It's not honest towards Alice. Promise you'll leave her. Are you the bastard who told people I'm gay? Bullshit. - I saw you with Yves, he told it to you? He told me nothing. Cool down, damn it. You'll regret it. - That's it. You have the training tonight? - Yes, why? Just like that. Do you have a match? Thanks. Courageous for the defense... The civil part already said he will appeal. Yesterday a 46 year old man got arrested in the Ivelines for the murder of Simon Werner. The man could be involved in other murders Michel, are you ready? Yes, I knew Simon. We were in the same class. Were you close to him? - Yes, we were friends. Alice? We're going for a drink? Will you come too? No, I don't feel like it. Thanks. Shall we bring you home? - No, I'll go back with a friend. Take care. - Don't worry. Rabier is now the big star. Three interviews, it's not amazing either. Are you jealous? In interviews, it's always the weird ones who talk. - Hey, Jeremie. Can I sit here? We're gonna start again with the band. So you felt like coming? We just need a drummer now.
