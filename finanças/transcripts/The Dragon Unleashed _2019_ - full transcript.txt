(ECHOES) Get them. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) BART: Danny! Attaboy! You borrow money from me, you're expected to pay it back. When you pay it back, the collar stays on. You don't pay it back, the collar comes off. It's a simple set of rules. (GROANS) Give us your arm. Hold still. Behave. It's nice. We'll be back. Come on, Danny boy. BART: Well, I had a dream last night. I was sitting under those umbrellas that they make out of palm leaves, you know? And these beautiful golden-skinned girls dressed in just, like, little grass skirts and the skin that they was born in. Yeah. And they came over, one after the other. And they brought me a drink in a coconut. And as they served me the drink, they brushed their tits across my face. Cor! Bloody hell! Hey, boss, I think Georgie's getting a chubby. You shut up, Lefty. You're the one getting a fucking hard-on, not me. Ah, well, that was the end of the best bits. After the girls, the whole thing turned to shit. This giant mumpet turned up with a machine gun. Started blasting away until there was nothing but blood and guts and bits of body everywhere. Nice One. It was a real nightmare. I bet you've never had a dream in your life, have you? Yeah, must be peaceful. Here. Have a bit of that. That's it. That's it. I hate dreams. (CAR ENGINE REVVING) Georgie boy. Hey. Yo, Righty, you mad bastard. Righty, how did you get on? Hello, guv'nor. All my people paid to the penny. 2700. Perfect. Give the lads a drink. Cheers, guv'nor. Yeah? What do you want done with Danny? Well, sort him out. His face is bleeding, look. Sort him out. Anybody have any trouble? Put it on there. Oh, nice. Come on, Danny, you heard the guv'nor. Here's a bonus, all right? Sort yourself out, okay? Come on, Danny. Danny, come on. Danny, come on! (THUMPING) (SAND POURING) (METAL CLATTERING) (SAND POURING) (WOMAN LAUGHING) Here, come on, love. Give us a pose. That's it, that's it. Hold it. Yeah. It's beautiful. Beautiful. Oi. Oi. Get back in the car. Fucking beast. Fucking wanker. I wanna get a close-up, that's it. Right, that's it. Let's have a look. Don't put your hands on it, you'll mark it. Oh, hello. Look at him. No, not here. Oh, yes. Yes, you're right. Let's go somewhere more comfortable. (GRUNTS) Oh, you're so rough. Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! No, turn the light on. No light. Turn on the lights. (LAUGHS) I like to see who I'm making love to. I don't. (YELLS) (GRUNTING) What the fuck? Shit! Fuck! Jesus! You sick bastard! Hey! Where you going? Fuck you. Much obliged! Fucking asshole! (YELLS) Attaboy! No way, boss. Hey, hey, hey, Nigel! Okay, Bart, all right, you want this? Yeah. Fuck! Turn it round, keep it running and keep your eye out for the old bill. Good luck, son. Luck? He don't need it, bro. (DOOR CREAKS CLOSED) (LIGHTER CLICKS SHUT) You know what I've always found fascinating about this whole situation of yours, Bart, buddy? How you basically turned a man into a dog. Well, it's like my sainted mum used to say, "Get them young enough and the possibilities are endless." Unlike yours at the moment. So, um... So let me work this through one more time. I don't pay you, you take his collar off. Correctimundo. You take his collar off, he beats us all to death. Now, who's the bright penny, hmm? So it's in my best interest to keep that collar on. (GRUNTS) Danny! Kill him! Danny! Kill him! Kill him! Danny! Danny! Kill him! Do something! (BARKS) When you've finished with the master, kill the dog. Danny! Kill him! Kill him! (GROANING) Good to see you, Mr. Yussef. (GROANING) (GROANING) (BONE CRACKING) (SCREAMING) Fucked Get them. Find anything you like yet? Not yet. (SCREAMS) Stop him! (WOMEN SCREAMING) (BONE CRACKING) Nice puppy. Good boy! I don't know what it is with people. Maybe I've got a speech deficiency. Take what you want. Oh, no. My mum didn't bring me up to be a pig. Not like some people I know. I only take what I'm owed. But this time... Yeah. With a little interest. Because you are such a fucking asshole. Come on. What are you looking at? Just enjoying the show. Good. Don't you ever leave my side again. You said, "Stay in the car." Shut the fuck up. Get in, bitch. I don't believe it. He just stood there and watched them beat the crap out of me. Even a dog has got the brains to come to his master's defense. Bites them! Claw them! Piss on them! Anything, for fuck's sake. Jesus. Jesus,boss, you don't look too good. Another original thinker. Oh, no. I just meant that maybe you might wanna go home. What's next? Just the antiques place. No, let's do it. Are you sure you're up to this? No, no. You let one of them payments slide and they'll all turn into original thinkers. Find a decent pub first, though. I want a pint. And you, you useless piece of shit. There. Right. Now, here's the plan. I'm gonna try and settle this in a peaceful and professional manner. (ECHOING) But if that doesn't work, I'm gonna press this... Hey! Oi! Oi! You pay attention. Now, when I press this button, this red light is gonna start blinking. Right? The red light blinks, you go through that door quicker than a mouse chasing a bit of... Keep your hands off him, will you? And stop fucking smirking! The red light blinks... Look at me, concentrate. The red light blinks, you go through the door. That's all you've gotta remember. Right? Light. Door. Light. Door. Light. Door. Oi! Right. And don't take your eyes off the light and don't let me down. Georgie? Yes, Bart. Hang that up there. What, up there? Come here. Au right. The light, Danny. The light. Red means go. Right? (PLAYS NOTE) (GROANING) (GASPS) Sounds like someone in here could use my help. (LAUGHS) Hi. How you doing? I'm just gonna tune these pianos. Probably be a couple of hours. If you don't mind. (PLAYING) You like pianos? Yeah, me, too. Of course, you know, this whole place is like a... It's like a big treasure chest. Probably gonna be a whole month getting all these ladies back into health. You know, tuning pianos is really hard work, and my back isn't what it used to be. Are you doing anything important right now? 'Cause I could really use a hand here. How about it? Please. Are you still there? You are, aren't you? Yes.. Good. Good. Come on. You know, a lot of people think because a piano's so big, it is very strong, and you can just pound on it any way you want to and nothing will happen. But that's not so at all. Pianos are a lot like people. I mean, you pound on a person, they get out of tune. Same with a piano. You pound on them and... Oh, Lordy, listen to that. Huh? Sad as a baby crying. I'll tell you what I want you to do now. When I say press, I want you to press on these keys. Starting with this one right here and going to the right. One, then two, then three. Think you can do that? Okay. Put your hand here, just like that. All right? Oh! Oh! Oh, my goodness! Oh. Wait a minute. Loosen up. Loosen up. That's it. Music's got to flow from within, you know. Can't flow if you're all stiff. On the key there. Just relax. Nothing to be afraid of. And there we are. Are you ready? And press. A little harder. Good. Again. Good. Listen, you show a real talent for this sort of work. Okay, press it again. Press. Oh, wonderful. And one more time. Ready? Press. Press. Go ahead. Relax. Let the energy flow. Let the magic happen! Good. Good. Good. Good. Excellent. Excellent. Oh, no, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Now, you want to see what you did? Yes.. Check this out. Is that the sweetest sound or what? Yes.. Want to try it? Here, go on. Put your hand here. Put your fingers right there, there and there. Hit it. Next stop, Carnegie Hall! You know about Carnegie Hall? It's this big place in New York City. All the great musicians want to play Carnegie Hail. I did, too. When I was growing up, it was my big ambition. But I never was that good a musician. Are you okay? Yes.. Good. What's your name? Okay, all right, all right. Mr. No-Name. My name is Sam. Pleased to meet you. Me, too. Good. That's good. So, tell me something, Mr. No-Name. I've been hearing this sort of clicking sound. Do you hear it? Or is it just... (GRUNTING) I'm gonna sell you is what I'm gonna do! If you can't do what I've trained you to do, what fucking use are you? No fucking use is the answer. No fucking use at all. I feed you. I clothe you! I put a roof over your head. And all that time I put in! All the fucking effort to make you the man that you are. And what gratitude do I get? Look at me! I look as if I've just been through the third fucking world war. Take him downstairs. Get him out of my sight. Come on, doggy. Come on. I'm getting too old for this shit. Go on then, Danny. Get in. Get in! (COUGHS) I'm busy. I said get in there. There's a man here to see you. I just told you I'm busy. He says he's got a business proposition for us. He says it's about the show you put on today. Pat him down. Already did. All right. Wheel him in. Fucking visitors, looking like this. It's a joke. Shit! Jesus! Fucking he!!! Leave us. I'm listening. That was a very impressive display your man put on in the jewelry shop today. I assure you, it was entirely justified. I'm sure it was. That thing with the collar, brilliant. And the point of this conversation is? The point of this conversation is I'd like to offer you a lucrative proposition. How lucrative? Very lucrative. Should I continue? Please. MAN CONTINUES: It's an entertainment I produce for some friends once a month. Members only, so to speak. What? We're always on the lookout for new talent. The first fight is a tryout. For that you get 15, 000. For the second, 20 plus the right to bet. We had one chap who, after fees and betting on himself got up to half a million a fight. That's only if you win, of course. BART: Well, how do you get to win? MAN: it's to the death. So glad you could make it. Please, follow me. Where's the money? Oh, well, the money comes after. After what? After you beat him, our current champion. Undefeated in 15 bouts. (YELLING) Would you care for a glass of champagne? We won't be here that long. Kill him. (YELLING) Rip his fucking ass off. groans) That's my boy! (ELEVATOR DINGS OPEN) Thanks for the opportunity. You're most welcome. Very impressive. That bit with the collar, how did you do that? Like my saint of a mum used to say, "Get them young and the possibilities are endless." I thought it was the Jesuits who said that. Aye. Probably got it from my mum. If you want us back, you do know where to find me. Oh, we certainly want you back. Only, if you could make it a little more entertaining next time. I'll see what I can do. Here, remember I told you about that dream I had? What? The one with all the birds in it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I figured it all out. Do you know who Freud is? No. Well, that don't matter. Freud was a genius. And his whole thing was that if you dream something, it means something else. Yeah. Like the girls, the island, the drink. Yeah, right. They were just symbols. What they actually represented was, like, comfort, relaxation, (PIANO PLAYING) no worries. And then this swell turns up offering us more money than we could save in 20 years. Well, it all becomes clear, doesn't it? The dream, the swell. It means retirement. You get it? Yeah. No more filthy collections. No more beatings. Oh, I tell you, I feel really good here. I feel generous. Danny, what do you want? A piano. Excuse me? I want a piano. A piano? Oh, yeah. How about a lobster dinner? I want a piano. How about a woman? You've never had a woman. I want a piano. Danny, you're starting to piss me off. I want a piano. That's what I love about you, Danny. One thought at a time. That's what makes us such a good team. The brains and the brawn. I'll tell you, this is gonna be one lovely day. (TIRES SCREECHING) (SCREAMS) Let's go. (PANTING) Good morning, ladies. How are we all this morning? Here you are. You've been very patient waiting for me, madam, so I'm going to devote myself to you all day. Who's there? It's you, isn't it? Yes.. Well, isn't that something? You know, (ECHOING) I went right home and I told Victoria, my stepdaughter I told Victoria all about you. (GASPS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hello? Don't tell me you're still asleep. Well, now. If I was a fellow who woke up in a strange house wearing someone else's pajamas, I would be pretty nervous. I'd try to find the safest place I could to hide. Now, when I was a kid, the safest place in the whole wide world was right where you are. It does feel safe, doesn't it? Well, I figured a man who'd been out for two days would wake up pretty hungry. So I hope you like peanut butter and jelly. My name is Sam, remember? Okay, you take your time. Victoria and I are not big on asking questions. Figure when the person is ready, they'll give their answers. Okay? Okay. (JAZZ PLAYING ON PIANO) (KEYS JINGLE) (GASPS) Hi! He's cute. Really? I like his haircut. It's like when I was six and used to cut my own hair. Yeah, well... You and Mom thought it was cute. He's not six. More is than not, I bet. Does he like to read? Well, I don't know. Does he like to write? Does he like to draw? Sweetie, I don't know anything about him. Well, that's not all together so. He likes music. Cool. (DOOR OPENS) Hi. Sam said you like music. You know how to use it? See? Nice, huh? Yeah. It was my dad's. He died before I was born and then my mom gave it to me. But she died in a car accident. But not until after she married Sam. He was my dad's best friend. Am I talking too much? You know, 'cause I do that sometimes. And if you're bored listening and I just keep going on and on, you just tell me, okay? I'm gonna go help Sam with dinner. And you can join us if you'd like or you can eat under here. You know, it's just the food goes down easier if you eat it sitting up. You don't burp so much. My name's Victoria. Should I go get him? No. Let's let him get himself. Maybe he doesn't know how. Well, then, let's give him the opportunity to learn. There's nothing like self-discovery for turning a boy into a man. How do you know? You never had a boy. I was speaking from self experience, if you don't mind. I was a boy myself once, you know. No way. Yes, way. Come on. Thank you for the food we're about to eat. Thank you for the peace this house possesses. Thank you for another day of health and happiness. And, please, make sure Victoria kicks butt on her piano recital. I thought we're not supposed to ask for things. Says who? Says you. Since I was a little girl you told me those are the rules. Oh, you mean I didn't tell you about the special exemption for very important piano recitals? Oh, yeah, right. Exemptions. I buy that. Not. You know, I liked it better when you just agreed with everything I said. How about some soup? VICTORIA: (WHISPERING) There you go. Well, you're just in time. This is your place. Come on, sit down. Okay? Victoria, would you... Oh, sure. Sam made this. It's his world-famous potato and leek soup. World-famous. There's your napkin. Bread? Um, no. This is a spoon. And this is your spoon. Like this. (SLURPING) Oh, my God. (BURPS) (BURPS) Oh, great. A duet. My name is Danny. I think we won't put a bandage back on and we'll let some air get to this. You're gonna be just fine. I've been meaning to ask you. What is this? Okay. No problem. I wasn't gonna take it off. You know, when I was kid, I had a cowboy hat. I slept in it, I ate in it, I bathed in it. Anybody tried to take it off, that same reaction. So... Anyway, I've been thinking. You've been cooped up in here for weeks now. Wouldn't you like to get some fresh air? Stretch your legs? It's nice outside. It's nice in here. You're afraid that if you go out you won't be able to come back in? We'll come back. Promise. To tell you the truth, I... I could use a little help. With pianos? Walking Victoria to school. VICTORIA: Here you got sidewalk. Okay. All right, we'll be back to get you at 3:00. I am 18, Sam. Yeah, for a whole week-and-a-half. 3:00. All right. Bye Bye. ' Bye. You all right? She kissed me. Yeah, I know, she does that. How was it? Wet. But is that all? Nice. Wet. Nice. Sounds like what a kiss ought to feel like. Come on, we got a lot to do. Hello, love. Oh, good morning, Maddy. Maddy runs the best supermarket in all of Glasgow. Maddy, this is Danny. Hello, Danny. He's a little shy. Oh, I like my men to be shy. Presents a challenge for a girl. I'm just gonna give him some of the finer points of shopping. Couldn't have a better teacher. Isn't that so? My mother could take two stones and a cup of water and make a three-course meal. As soon as I was old enough, she gave me the secret of great cooking. And now I'm gonna teach it to you. So, you ready to learn the secret to great cooking? Yes. Okay, here it is. Food talks. Food talks? You didn't know that, did you? No. Food talks. It will tell you everything you need to know. All you have to do is learn the language. Take this melon here for instance now. (TAPPING) What do you think that's saying? (PUFFS) laughs) Yeah. But it's also saying, "I am ripe." You know what ripe means, don't you? No. Ripe means sweet and sweet means good. The kiss was ripe. Uh,no,no. The kiss was sweet. The melon is ripe. But ripe means sweet. Well, when you're talking about food. Kisses are nourishing in their own way, but kisses are... Kisses are complicated. For now, let's just stick to melons. (INHALING DEEPLY) Good bread is fresh. Here, smell it. Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. Good. All right. Get some bread, Danny. Okay, now comes the hard part. Cooking. Over there in that cabinet, there's a large, round pot. Would you get it for me? Okay. Now, when we cook the food, it speaks to us in another language, which we listen to with our tongues, by tasting. Look at these beauties. Yeah. Now, you know you've got good sausage when they're attached like this. Hmm. Found something, didn't you? Now, let's see... That's Victoria when she was a little baby. And that's Victoria with her mom. Her father was my best friend. He died before Victoria was born. Her mother was my best friend, also. So, after he died, she and I got married. Then, there was a car accident when Victoria was seven years old. Her mother was killed, and I lost my eyesight. Victoria was left with me. Funny how families get made, isn't it? You got family? Don't know. Well, you must have. Everybody's got family somewhere. I don't remember them. Well, maybe you will one day. The pots are in there. Earth to Danny. Sam sent me. All by yourself? Wow, big day! We should celebrate. What's that? "Celebrate"? It means we should do something special. Sam said right home. Come on. Here. Thank you. Come on. This is the cone and this is the ice cream. You ever have ice cream before? No. Well, this is vanilla ice cream. Vanilla's white. Vanilla is white. Go on, taste it. Oh, no. Just work it around. (SWALLOWS) Oh, my God! You know the thing about ice cream is first it's cold, but then it's sweet. And if you freeze your mouth out, you're never gonna be able to taste the sweet part. So look, here's how you do it. You... Sweet is good. Yeah, right. So look, you lick like that. There you go. How's that? Look. You're getting it everywhere. Shit. Actually, we should really hurry. Come on. You okay? Finish it quickly. And remember, if Sam asks where we were, you let me do the talking. If he knows we had ice cream before dinner, he'll be pissed we ruined our appetite. Understand? What's appetite? Appetite's what you have if you don't have a belly full of ice cream. How's my mouth? Nice. No, it's not. It's full of hardware, but not for much longer. Do you miss your mom? Every day. You miss your mom? I don't remember my mom. Sometimes I think it'd be easier not to remember. Hi. Hi. You're late. It was so nice out we decided to walk the long way. Oh, you... Didn't I say bring her straight home? Sam, it was me, not him. Oh, it was... If you wanted to take the long way home, Victoria, you could have gone to that school in Kansas. Then you could have taken the long way home for 50 miles and I wouldn't care! 50 miles of corn. Corn is safe. Corn is boring. And anyway, this was the better school. Which is why we're here and not with the corn, right? So do me a favor. Don't make me worry. Okay, Sam. Au right. (SNIFFING) What is that? What? It smells like ice cream. Vanilla ice cream. Vanilla is white. First is cold, then is sweet. Sweet is good. (MOUTHING) (PLAYING ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD) Victoria? Yeah? Sometimes I worry about that boy. It's as if something or someone has made him shut down his feelings so hard, he can no longer get in touch with them. That's what I've been trying to get him to do. With vanilla ice cream? Maybe we should come up with some different strategies. Good night. Night. Come on. When I was little, I used to do this with my mom and Sam. It's kind of how I fell in love with music. See these thingies? They're called notes. Notes. Okay. Notes are signals. Notes are signals. Okay. Notes are signals. So if you see this note, it's the signal to play this key. And this one this key. And this one this key. Right? So you're gonna play, and you're gonna hop. Great! Ready? I'm gonna go. (PLAYING HABANERA FROM CARMEN) Keep going. Don't stop. It's not ripe. Hello, Sam. Hi, Maddy. How's the lessons going? On, he’s growing by leaps and bounds. What is this you got here? Too ripe. MAN: I'm gonna fuck you, you fucking tosser. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Alex, go around the other side. Quick. There he is! Get him. Where's Danny? (GRUNTING) Danny! Yeah, that's ripe. (YELLS) Let's go, get out. Danny! This one's ripe. Danny, do you remember when I said that Victoria and I were not big on asking questions? That we thought when people were ready, they'd give their own answers? I remember. Well, after today in the supermarket, I need some answers and I don't think I'm gonna get them without asking the questions. Is that all right? Okay. Okay, so, in the market, those men, they were fighting. You knew that, right? Yes. But that didn't bother you? No. You weren't afraid? No. Normally, people find themselves in situations like that, they get afraid. They weren't fighting me. Okay, one more question. When you first came to us, you were hurt pretty bad. How did that happen? I ask for a piano. You asked who for a piano? My uncle. Oh. Oh, you do have family? No. But you just said you had an uncle. He's dead. Oh. Is this good? That's wonderful. Hey, ready? Yeah. (SCREAMS) God! You're acting ridiculous. It's not so bad. (CREATURE ROARING) (WHIMPERS) (DOOR OPENS) Is anyone thirsty? I'm kind of thirsty. Now, that looks like it belongs there. Where is it? It's right there. Oh, yes. It belongs there. (PLAYING ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD) Hi. Can I come in? Okay. Where'd you learn that? Learn what? The piece of music you just played. It's what I hear in my head. Do it again. It's hard. Someone had to teach it to you. You don't remember? No. Maybe in your other life, the one you had before us. I don't know. Everything is new about you now. Your clothes, your hair, your whole life. This is the last thing that... I think it's time to put the last thing away. Don't you? Everything is new about you now. Good night. Oh, yes. My boy, we're going to have fun. (PIANO STRING TWANGS) That's good. That's good. That's good. Alrighty then. You know, Victoria's big recital is next month, right? Do you remember me telling you about where I grew up, in New York City? Where Carnegie Hall is? Yeah, well, that's where Victoria and I are from. That's our home. This is your home. No, no, this is just a temporary home. We only came here so Victoria could attend school. What I'm trying to say, Danny, is after Victoria graduates, we're gonna go back home. We're gonna go back to New York. And well, I don't know how this would work out but we would really like for you to come with us because we've begun to think of you as family. And, well, that's, that's what families do. They stick together. Or at least this one does. So what do you say? Yes. Yes. Two, three, four, five. This is your pay. Fifty-fifty. Partners. You and me. Happy? What do I do with it? Anything you want. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GRUNTS) For fuck's sake, man. Danny! All right, Danny. Look at you. You look great, man. Look at... You smell divine, pal, I tell you. I don't know what you're wearing. Well, fancy bumping into you, eh? Boss sends me out, get some mangoes and papayas, and look what I find instead. A lemon. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Your Uncle Bart has been sick with worry, mate. Yeah, his little pet all lost in the world. It's all he keeps on talking about, honestly. "Where's my little Danny?" He's dead. Who told you that? I saw. Well, you saw wrong, mate, because he's very, very much alive and very much looking forward to you coming home. Not my home any more. "Not my home any more. Not my home any more." Why? You got a new home, have you, Danny? Eh? You got a new family as well? Well, tell you what. If you don't come home like a good little bitch, Uncle Bart will send a few of the boys out to pay a visit to your new home. Would you like that? Wouldn't be too hard to find, what with you shopping here and all. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) Look who's come home to his loving Uncle Bart. Give me a hug. How's my boy? You're looking smart. Oh, look at her. Ragner the prat. We've missed you around here, haven't we? Yeah, we've definitely missed you, Danny. Must have really scared you, that accident, all that shooting. Yeah, me, too. Well, look at me. Look,eh? I've been laid up for a month but I'm back and I'm ready to roll. You ready to roll? I have a question. (LAUGHING) You? A question? Wonders never cease. It's not about that bleeding piano again, is it? No. Oh, well. Well, listen, as I'm so pleased to have you home I'll answer one question. Go on, fire away. Did you know my mom? Your mum? Why would I know your mum? I found you in the street, laying on the pavement. You was half dead. You couldn't even talk. You was just laying there. No one wanting you. No one caring whether you lived or died. Except me. I've told you all this before, remember? All right, listen, I'll show you stuff that'll jog your memory. That was our first collaboration, that was. Danny, what's this sudden fascination with the past? Have you been talking to people? No. You want some good advice from your Uncle Bart, eh? Don't dwell on the past. Look to the future. The past is behind you. The future is ahead of you like a bright, glittering mountain of gold. Do you wanna know what your future is, Danny? MAN: I'm thrilled you're here. We've been waiting for you. Has our friend been practicing on you? Had an accident. Right this way. Show's about to start. How's our boy? He's never been better. I hope so, because he certainly has his work cut out for him tonight. I've dressed him in his Sunday best. (CROWD CHEERING) We are expecting more of a show this time. Don't worry about it. We've got it all worked out. Isn't that right, Danny? Listen. Give these toffs a bit of a show. Play him for a bit. Make it look as if there might be a chance that you could lose. Gentlemen. Wyeth? To the death. Right. Down you go. Go on. What's wrong with you? I don't want to hurt people any more. Excuse me? Danny, that's what you do. You hurt people. Not any more. What the hell's happened to you? Who's been filling your head with this crap, eh? Anything wrong, gentlemen? No, no, no. We're fine. No, just discussing strategy. Of course. Listen to me, you little shit. You're gonna get down there and you're gonna do your job, or I'm gonna have your balls on a stick. Now go! I don't want to hurt people any more. I'll make you a deal. If you go down there tonight, do your job, I promise you, tomorrow I will buy you the nicest piano in the whole bleeding city. How's that? I don't want to hurt people any more. Then you're dead. Now, go! (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) (CROWD CHEERING) Go get him, tiger. Come on. Come on, Danny. Come on. What's going on? Well, you said you wanted it to be more of an entertainment. He's not even fighting back. Pick it up! ALL; Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Get it! Danny! Danny! I think we have a problem here. What? These people came to see a fight. Not a bloody game of tag. (GROANS) Do you mind if I get a little creative with the format? It's your show. (GRUNTING) (GROWLS) Danny, you're ruining me here! It's time to make some money! Danny, you're gonna get killed! Fight back! Danny! Weapons! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (YELLING) (SCREAMING) (THUDDING) (HEARTBEAT RACING) (HEARTBEAT SLOWING DOWN) Kill him! If you don't kill him, I don't get paid. Jesus! Kill him for Christ's sake. Danny! Come on. Before they kill me! Kill him! Oh, fuck it. No more killing! I decide when there's no more killing. I. Me. The master commands and the dog obeys. I will kill you. Put him to bed. Hurry up. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Why did he leave? Maybe he had something to do. But I thought he was happy here. Well, sweetie, sometimes being happy just isn't enough. Sometimes people have to go back and fix the things that made them unhappy before they were happy. But I could help him. I know. Sometimes people have to do things themselves. (METAL JANGLING) (WOMAN LAUGHING) Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. That's good. You lied to me! You bastard! What are you doing in my fucking chair, you little retard? You lied to me! This is my mother. You knew my mother! She was a whore. Do you know what a whore is, Danny? Money for sex, like the girls I bring here. I did everything I could to help her. I liked your mum. She understood me. If there had been anybody really special, it would have been her. And when she died, I felt I owed it to her to raise you, to protect you. Look, this... Her picture's here. This one. Look. I'm sorry I lied to you, Danny. I did it out of love. Now, let's go and make up some of that money you lost for me the other night, right? You know, Danny, sometimes in families, you need a little tragedy just to bring everybody back together. LEFTY: Absolutely, boss. You know, it's like me and me brother in Blackpool. We used to go down to... Excuse me. Where's the manners? I'm talking. I was just validating, boss. Did I ask for a validation? No, but I thought, you know 'cause... Will you shut your yap? Now I've lost the train of me thought. What was I saying? Families. Right. Right. Yeah. How they should be together. Exactly. Families should be together. No matter what. No matter what. Get off! Get him off! What the hell are you doing? Danny! Slow down! You bastard! Get him, boss. (SCREAMING) Shit! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) My mother. She was a whore. Look, not that I'm an expert, but I have to say, she does not look like, you know, that kind of woman. What does that mean? Well, she's playing the piano. What else is in the photo? There's a bunch of students in uniform. There's a big stained-glass window. It looks like an academy or something. And there's two baby grands, back to back. What kind of baby grands? Pleyel, both. I've got an idea. Excellent job you made of tuning the pianos in the concert hall, young man. Why, thank you, ma'am. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Last fellow we had in was so drunk he didn't find the hall. Ended up tuning the plumbing. Terrible mess. SAM: Danny? Thirty-two years of faces and I've never forgotten one, especially this one. Why especially this one? Brilliant girl. Absolutely brilliant. Destined for great things, we were sure of it. And then one day she just disappeared. We thought she'd gone home. We thought maybe it was financial. We knew she had some money problems. Ah-ha! But then, her family from China wrote to ask why she hadn't got in touch with them. Had a little boy and everything. Very strange. Sad, really. Ah-ha! Here she is. (LAUGHING) You okay? I'm okay. You sure? Sure. Okay. Hello! Guys? Sam? Danny? (KNOCKING) You were supposed to pick me up. I'm sorry. You got another picture. The lady said that she was an excellent piano player. I'm sure. You wanna hear what she played? H ow? See? "Mozart, Sonata Number 11. " Your mom didn't just play music, she played beautiful music. Magical music. Great music. (POUNDING ON DOOR) (CLATTERING) No! (GASPS) I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I really do need to know where to find him. No, I've never seen him before in my life. Let me rephrase the question. What is this? Oh, Sam! Oh, Sam! He remembered. I was playing the piano, the music, and he remembered. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down, slow down. Remembered what? His mother. Who killed his mother. You remember who killed your mother? Sam, we have to go. Wait, son. Wait now. Before we go running off anywhere, let's stop and take a deep breath and decide what's going on. Tell me from the top. I... Danny? Oh, God. Danny. Wait. Listen to me. Danny, wait. Will you just listen? No time. Danny. Danny, wait. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Boss, these boys aren't up to it. He's fucked off. Get in there. Right. Oi, I want him alive. He's not worth shit to me dead. Go on. (GRUNTING) (BONES CRACKING) Shit! You'd better get in there. You. You. That way. (SCREAMS) (YELLS) (WOMAN SINGING) (SHOWER RUNNING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Yeah, nice. This'll keep her out of harm's way. (SCREAMING) Shit! Fuck! (SCREAMING) That's it. That's it! That son of a bitch! It's all going on the bill, Danny boy. Do you hear me? It's going on the bill. And you're gonna pay. Believe me, you're gonna pay. Bastard! You know, it was your fault, really. You were such a scrapper. I could see the potential. With the right training, my own little guided missile. Listen, Danny. I know we've had some rough patches, but what family doesn't, eh? Listen, you get over this business, we can have plenty more. Shit! Find him! (SHOUTING) I can kill him now! Shut up! But he's in there, damn it! Shut up! Shut up. Let me listen. Stop breathing down my fucking ear. Sorry, boss. Just move. Just move back. (GRUNTING) (FAINT THUMPING) Clever little bastard. Wait here. All of you, wait here. BART: Danny! Danny! Danny, where are you? Bastards. Pajamas? Fucking pajamas? You ungrateful little bastard! Where are you? You gave up our good life for this? This is it? This is your refuge? Your home away from home? This is your place of... awakening? Art. Books. Music? For what? Did it make you a better person? Look what you made of it. Nice people took you in. They give you everything, and look how you repay them. You destroyed their lives, like you'll destroy any life. That's because you're not meant for this kind of life, Danny. You're a dog. You're my dog. I fed you, I trained you, I own you. And I should kill you, like any responsible owner would do to a dog that caused this much pain, this much suffering. (SCOFFS) But... I can't. Come home, Danny. All's forgiven. You'll be safe. You'll be back in a world that you understand. The only world you'll ever understand. What do you say? Forgive and forget? I know just how confusing the world can get. We'll make it simple again. You, me. Our cozy little life. Come on, Danny. Come on. Come on. Yes, that's my boy. Yes. Come on. Come on. Come on. Welcome home, Danny. I am home. No! (SHOT FIRED) (BONE CRACKING) (PANTING) No! Danny, don't! He's gonna kill him! Don't, Danny. Danny, don't! Don't do this, Danny. Don't. He killed my mother! It won't bring her back, and you'll be just like him. He is me! We're both animals. Fucking dog! No, you're not an animal. If you kill him, Danny, everything you've done to make yourself happy will be lost. Don't listen to this crap. They will lock you in a cage forever. We are animals. No, Danny. No. Kill me! No, Danny. You know why he wants you to kill him? Danny, listen to me. Listen. Remember your mother? You remember what I did to her? I screwed her every day. I mounted her like the bitch she was! (ROARS) Don't! Yeah. You'll never be anything but a dog. You'll never escape what you are. You'll never escape what I made you. A killer, that's what you are. And that's what you'll always be. Now, be a good dog. Kill me. Get it over with. Come on! Kill me! Shut the hell up. That man could talk some serious shit. You all right with that thing around your neck? Is it okay? Well, I'd have to say it was a decided improvement. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the 200th awarding of the scholarship for excellence in piano, Miss Victoria Mills. (CROWD APPLAUDING) My selection tonight is dedicated to someone wonderful. That's you. Oh, no, no. it's not me she's talking about. Someone whose life was quite literally saved by music. That's you, my boy. (PLAYING SONATA NUMBER 11)
