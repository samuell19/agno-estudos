What day today? - May 3, captain. What do you have, Grappe? Become a politician? Are you in resistance? Are you against the war? It is No? So go back to the front tomorrow. My finger did not heal, captain We will see. Indeed. But it's not serious. You can squeeze the trigger with your middle finger. Enough to kill a Boche. How did you leave? - They did not ask me anything. What are you doing here? Quiet, Grandma. Please. Mrs. Dupuy cried a lot. To the knowledge of the death of the son. If I could have seen him... Glad you did not see it, they cut his nose. He was disfigured. And of the Vaugoubert, Do you remember? You saw him at the farm. He was hit 7 times before he died. When I came back of an expedition without injuries... ...there was no need to apologize, she said it was not her fault. Parents could go to the funeral... ...as long as they were not in mourning. And stay only 5 minutes because of the bombings. I do not want to die. Louise Grappe? - Yes. Had some recent contact with your husband? Not since he went to the front, It's been two weeks. The last time I saw him was in the hospital. After that, no contact Why? Do not say he's dead. He defected on May 19. I do not believe what you're saying. Her husband fled to the countryside. Or to the outside. I'm sure you'll get in touch. For your sake, warn us. I'll do that, of course. And why would he do that, Mrs? Why you disgraceful be the wife of a deserter. Good Morning. Ladies... Close the curtain. Take it, help me. Let's not talk about it with Paul, are you okay? What you make me do... He can not stay here. Louise, You have to be brave. You have to report it. Are you crazy? Do you think I'll report it? The man I love? So let him give himself up. You're right. He's going to be shot. The problem is over. Living with a convict Death is not life. The life is mine. We succeeded in being happy, believe. You're lucky. I'm afraid. Afraid? So, report us. What is he doing? - Causing lice. Need an iron? - Please. With so much lice, not secure the eggs. Ladies, this soldier needs help. Come here. I'm going to iron your clothes. Sit down. Take off the shirt. How are things on the forehead? Maybe you do not want to say it? No, not at all. For the infantry, simple. Do not let yourself be killed by artillery. For this, We left at night. Any displacement it happens in the twilight. We're always hiding. Here is our heroism: to hide as best as possible. Do you like it? - Ah yes. Put this on while you wait. Come have a coffee to honor the French army. A droplet? Why are you tinkering with my things? I'm looking for a dress for Paul. A dress for Paul? I thought you were crazy, but you got over it. Glad you kept this one. Stop moving. Do you like to play dolls? No. It has to stay different of the posters. In two hours, I'll be bearded. So... Oh, that's not it. Please, Paul. - No. Ridiculous Wait. Let me see the light. I have not yet arrived, but it's not bad. How do I have to understand this? Are you taking one with me? No. Where do these insane ideas come from? What if they talk to me on the street? Did you think of my voice? I'm fried. It's not bad being a woman, Paul. At least, we are not going to war At least, we are not going to war I filled you with lipstick. I can not stay here, Louise. Must leave. You just have to take a look. - You know it's impossible. Dangerous. Must have a way out of the country, right? Who do you want me to ask? People talk, Paul. - I do not know... And to escape, it will cost us what we do not have. I'll find myself. Do you think the French army... ...just have this to do, Company Information I It would be good for you. If they arrested me, right? I could get you another. - I do not want another one. He's a little old, but - Stop that nonsense. No. I do not want to get dressed of woman. I told you. We have no choice, Paul. This or getting stuck here, praying that no one will find you. So, you decide. I bought that too. What? A waxing machine, by electrolysis. No... All right? Shall we stick the other? - Let's go. There. Hurt me. - The dress, now. This one? No, not this one. - Why? He's simple... It does not have to be simple. For your body, this is better. I'll look like a grandmother... With some details, It will look more elegant. Do you think? My Adam's apple. Just give him. I thought of that. Ready. I can not believe it seeing me like this. I need to kiss you. - Wait. Stop. She would have to redo the makeup. - No problem. I'm not that strong. I like, but not that strong. Need something? Yes. Air. But Paul... - Suzanne. Suzanne... What are you going to do? Pass the war with those ugly dresses? Paul is hiding. It is being sought. If you have another solution, can tell us. What do you prefer? Let me be a state box and die in the trenches? You're going to have to gain a few pounds... here. I do not know how. Only use a bicycle pump. Ended. - Did you want more? I want to. I'll drink a little more. I'm happy, take it... Light as a feather, How they say. No, thank you. I'm not very well, Paul. Suzanne... Your face is not good at all. I have a business in my stomach. Normal. We'll get used to it. I expect. Come on, Grandma. A toast to Suzanne. Suzanne. - Suzanne. It was good. - Yes, very good. Excuse me, We ended up late in the atelier. All right? I do not want to be a woman. I want to be a man. Your Paul. But you're my Paul. Do you have a fever? - Perhaps. Louise. I need to know if I can get out like this. Is important But what time is it? "Two, I think. Do you want to leave at two in the morning? Can you help me with the necklace? Do not you want me to go with you? - No. I need to have the courage to go out alone. I will take it. Give me more security. Good... I'm fine like this? I'm going. And that's how Paul Grappe became Suzanne Landgard. Venturing into your neighborhood at night, Suzanne discovered the wonders of the Bois de Boulogne. An enchanted garden, the stop of the adventures, voluptuous corner of the meetings, place of all sensual pleasures. All. He was a man, was a woman, the god and goddess of the night. What do you got, little boy? Nobody notices me. - Why? Maybe it's too cute. That intimidates. Sit here. Comes. Three more months like this. Then I'm going to get a denture. The doctor broke the jawbone with a hammer. It stung me alive. It was hard, but it's done. Let's go? Are not you disappointed? No. But you too You risk having a surprise. I love surprises. But I do not have much money. For you, it will be of grace. What happened to your finger? There's nothing. An accident. Good Morning. Look what tonight made me. To the guns, citizens. Form your battles Let's march, let's march That impure blood Bathe our fields Long live the Republic. Long live France. This is a party day. Let's stop working, girls. What are you doing tonight? Nothing special, I'm going home. Let's dance? I'm inviting you. Thank you, but I can not. I promised Suzanne. Call to come with us. Suzanne, Suzanne, always Suzanne. We'd love to meet this Suzanne. This friend of yours never leaves? 'To live happily, Let's hide. ' And why do not you kiss me? I follow you. Raymonde, Do you take care of the tissues? Louise. Have dinner with me tonight. No, I can not. "Suzanne again?" And Paul? You have no news? No, not one. Why are you talking about Paul? Now the war is over. Can I understand two women? Living together. But what about him? He, if he returns, goes to jail. You have to get a divorce. With a deserter, you will. You have a chance to live today. I loved a woman, I hid from everyone. I never told her that. Good evening, Valentine. The preliminary arrangements were made by telephone. The partners without money were rejected. The best conditions for a party in the Forest... ...were the good weather and a little moon. Sometimes Louise was going with Suzanne. At your night out. But Louise was afraid, ladies and gentlemen. Do you think jewelry? I do not know, when we sell, we'll know. When you come, we got double. I do not like to do that. We approach when we go together. I know this gives you pleasure, but it bothers me. What bothers you? All these strangers, I do not give an account. I need... ...meet people to sleep with them. To love them a little. Love them? But I do not love you, Louise. I love you. And you. Kiss Me. With others there is love. Gluttony like that. Take it. Along the useful to pleasant, That's it. If that does not please you, I stop. I'm not asking for this, Paul. Excuse. How are you, Guillemette? - Good. Was Sunday good? - Was. Tighten the seams better. Do everything with English stitching. Sir? The mistress, please. - This way. Good morning lady. Sir? Charles de Lauzin. Sorry for disturbing your work, Suzanne sent me here. We saw each other yesterday in the Forest, Do you remember? I remember. So what? So I fell in love. Why are you laughing? Because it's an idiotic joke. Suzanne, crazy for giving you the address. Will you allow me? I've never seen you in the Forest before. I rarely go. Why? You do not want to indulge in pleasure, like your friend Suzanne? I do not like all the pleasures. And during the week, As you saw, I work. That's why I sleep early. I'm not so lucky. I love to make you smile. I need to get back to work. Let's go back, Mr. Earl? Certainly not. Let's go to Montmartre. Montmartre? - Yes, let's drink together. She's gorgeous. Gorgeous. Good night, have fun. Good night. - Good night. Thank you for coming. Odette. Good night. It's been a long time. Sit down in my chair. An old fellow. She's been with me forever. When I was a dragon in Perpignan. I did not know you were a hero. No... Just decorated. I'm not dead. But I miss my forehead. I miss the front? Do you really want to stay in p? Suzanne's role is over now. Your husband has a reason to hide. Until now, no lawyer it would be foolish to defend him. The deserters did not understand the experience of the forehead. They are not men. Do not you understand that this conquer the c u. When the heart is renewed... I've never felt so free. As in a battle. My life never seemed so precious. However, I would leave her without regret, because I did not belong to me anymore. You can not refuse the experience... ...That's war provides. When you risk your life for the nation, the soldier becomes the whole nation. It is an intense joy. War frees us from ourselves. A higher life. Since the end of the bout, I lost a soul. A soul bigger than mine. Peace only left me the emptiness and disenchantment, the monotony... ...and pettiness. There remained the temptation of despair. I even thought about suicide. Luckily I found you. You became the best part of my life. I will not be the best part of your life. I would not know how to be. The love that I have for you is not blind. He's right. Strong and strong love. He will not disturb you. Good morning, Mr. Earl. Louise is waiting for you, my friend. Mr. German? - No, Miss, I'm Polish. But the Count appreciates the German culture... ...and romantic music. And you too, Apparently. He told me that Mr. It's his real family. Let's go? Why do you cry? I'm happy. Happy why? Because you love me. And I love you. And we travel... ...both. And we go that far. Have you seen the Earl? He's seductive. I warned you. The dog also belonged to him. He did not count your parachute jumps He jumped, sometimes, 12 or even 16 times. 16 jumps in one day, ladies and gentlemen. Suzanne was like, 'Fly with me, Louise.' 'We are not victims, we are free women. ' But Louise resisted. 'I do not understand where you want to take me.' And Suzanne would answer: 'And you think I know?' 'We are explorers, my Louise. ' 'Explorers do not know what I'll find out. ' You have many admirers. I do not have it. Samuel Who always sends me flowers. To encourage me. My boss is very kind to me. People will hear your story. Must be the maximum, no? I'm a circus bug, Mr. Conde. It is not the glory, but give money. Please sit down. Do you still smoke? I'm surprised to see you here. In fact, I'm not happy to show... ...things that must remain secret. Anyway... ...I need to modernize. Congratulations on what you got. You're very lucky. I did not understand. Let's talk about man to man. If I may say so... ...its the only way back to Earth, Forget Suzanne and these nonsense... ...and go back to being Paul Grappe. Back to Paul Grappe? You can count on my support, my friend. What matters to me is Louise's happiness. I'll take care of that do not miss anything to your child. What son? I thought... I'm not ready. To have a child. I'm not ready. Why did not you tell me anything? Because I knew I did not want to. Was that it? You have to give me some time. I need some time. I promise we will have a child later, but now... It's not the time. Stop. This one we will not have. Say something. Why do not you say anything? What's it? Answer me. Answer. Why did the Count know and I did not? Answer. Say something. Paul? Paul? Now you're scared of me? Do not torment me. We were in the good life... Was a dream. Yes, it was a dream. Delicious that soup. - Thanks. I asked your grandmother make this lunch simple... ...what is the best environment to do business. Business lunch? I wanted to transform your story. In a show. But I'll take care of everything. I can drive, act, stay ahead, behind I'll be everywhere. You're a unique case. Yes, my dear Paul. Or my face Suzanne... I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. I'll let you think about the offer. And just a soup is enough for me. I'm on a diet. Take it. Here's my card. Do not delay. I need a big show. Excuse me, but I'm not an actor. Actor, actress... Whatever. You are a phenomenon. They want to see you live. Why did you come back so early? I wanted to find you. Why are you having this? In case of a bad date. It would be good if she stopped prostituting herself. Do not talk like that. I like what I do. I do not want you to judge me. I'm not judging you. - Yes, it is. He called me a whore. Let's live on what? Lead welders and seamstress salary? Maybe you should take Samuel's offer. What do you prefer? You think I'm going to make more? Do whatever you want. I love you like you Love me as I am But I do not know how I am... How she had transformed him in Suzanne, Louise turned him into Paul. One week was enough... ...for the odyssey of defector transvestite ...to appear in every newspaper. And that's how Paul Grappe... ...went from clandestinity to glory. Srs. and Srs. I know you're impatient, but I'm a bit calm. You can ask your questions, but one at a time. Yes? As it passed from Suzanne, the transvestite to Paul Grappe, deserter amnestied? Any other questions? His amnesty rewards deserters. Thus, government encourages other Suzannes. No political question, please. You were a woman... How to be a woman? Mr. Grappe. The cat ate his tongue. Mr. Grappe, answer. I asked a question... He does not want to talk. Yes? Do you think you lived an odyssey? Of sex, as the newspapers say? You've been a woman for years, Will not you regret this time? Our sphinx will guard your secrets. What do I pay you for, Paul? For what? I could not Does not leave. We rehearsed a lot. I knew the answers. We have 30 presentations. I'll cut the questions. It's not the most important. You have to be strong. I'm stronger when I'm Suzanne. And I do not want to choose between Paul and Suzanne. I do not want you forced on me. Louise? Louise... Where is Louise? - He's not here. Where is she? - I do not know. Paul. Is not the mirror over? Can I stay here for a bit? To do what? Like this. Go. Gentlemen? Ready? Mr. Paul Grappe, please. Smile. Can we do another one? - Yes. Yes. Give me a second, please. OK... Do the same thing... All right, Paul. Mr. Grappe... Ready, please? Smile. Perfect again. Thank you. This one here? - No, that fox... We need to get the sawdust for cleaning. Paul Grappe is here. Louise disappeared. I hit her. Is she in Lauzin? I do not know where she is. Thank you. You're not welcome in this house. I'll repeat: no welcome. Mr. Paul Grappe. Thank you, Ludwig. You can leave us. Let's have the son, if you want. I will be a good father, a normal father. Dude, its facets are fun. It would, if it were not a risk for Louise. A good father? A normal father? A transvestite. Come on, Louise. - Enough, Paul. You're not taking Louise for a. She decides. You were good to me. But you're not that I love, Sorry. Paul? Paul. Your face is not good. I prefer Suzanne. Me too. Leave us, my love... One minute break. I'm bothering? - No, no... How's Louise? He's taking care of the baby. And painting lead soldiers. The situation is difficult. And you, my friend, how are you? I'm looking for a job. Would you have nothing for me? All the papers are busy. Ah, not as an actor... I can take care of the clothes, between scenes. Or so... Take care of the projectors. I can learn. I do not know, but I will think. We can have dinner together after the show. You can tell me what you think. I'm glad you came by to see us. Come back anytime. Excuse me, but duty calls me. You know how the theater. Music. Alas, Mrs. Grappe. "Thank you, Doctor." Why did not you tell me you were sick? Three weeks of not normal bronchitis. You're being stubborn. Promise you'll take care of yourself. A little. A little no. You have to take everything. And this is it? Are you smoking? Prepare. Fire. Hey, Louise... You're still young. This submission to Paul has to end. My Submission? Why are you saying that? I love him and that's all. Look how handsome that is. Crepe from China. But I imagine you do not know what. Each one works dressed as he wants. Work for the imbeciles. I do not even want to hear. As in war: let the fools die. Good Morning. How much should I? - 3 francs. Leave me alone. This is no place for a girl. You're embarrassing me with this child. What are you doing? You see. I'm looking for Suzanne. After all this time. But it did not work... Those eyes... This mouth is not good. I lost my way. Good thing he's not crying. Please, do not mistreat it. He stinks. I'm going to change my diaper. Stop. Leave it alone - Are you sure it's mine? That's why you do not want me to get it. Let me get it. - Stop. Paul, you're drinking too much. Let me through. - Where are you going? To the Count's house? You will not leave. Let's stick the three together. Make him quiet, Shit. If he continues, I'll shut his mouth. Stop, Louise. LOUISE WAS PRESERVE. FOUR MONTHS LATER, HAS BEEN JUDGED AND ABSOLUTE FOR THE DEATH OF HIS HUSBAND. We were lucky we did not get it. - Yes. Have you ever had chicken pox? And your fiance works there? Thank your mother for the jelly. She will get irritated, as always... Look at Louise. - Serious? Louise. - Louise. Can I get it? Come here, you little sweetheart. He's got a solution. What's his name? - Paul... Paul Grappe, like his father.
