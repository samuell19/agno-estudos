This is Eagle 107, Eagle 107. Approaching, Delta target. Eagle 107 to base. Eagle 107 to base. We found, found it. Hey guys, the lost canyon is real. Tad, dinner's ready. In a minute. The Explorer's just landed at the excavation site. 107 equipment to the base. Digging started. Yo Tad, you found some treasure? Not yet. Dude, you find anything. Looser. - Tad, dinner's getting cold. - Coming. One, two and three. Gold? Gold. Gold. I found my first treasure. We Want You for the archeology elite. It's one of your father's cufflinks. He always said they were his lucky pair. Finally. I'm not a loser. You sure aren't. Good night, Tad. Wait. You gotta check for monsters, first. I almost forgot. Clear Clear All clear. Dad wasn't afraid of anything, was he? - Sure he was But he had courage to face his fears. What exactly was he afraid of? ...that his little boy never got to sleep on time. Sweet dreams, my little boy. You'll be the best treasure hunter ,when you grow up. Oh this is not good. Grandmother? You know what bandaged face? Some day I will grow up, and then you won't scare me. Stop. Download that moron before he gets hurt Or worse. I get sued. Hey, boy. you're back. Super cookie! Tad, this is your final warning. Stop goofing-off! But there could be important stuff down there. For the last time. You're a construction worker. Not an archaeologist. And stop bringing this mangey mut to work. He's not a mangey mut. Jeff was named after Thomas Jefferson... who is considered the forefather of American archeology. Interesting factoid, right? Don't you think? Here's another interesting factoid. You're fired! Tad, man. You can't keep doing this. This is the seventh time you've been fired this year. Well, I can't be fired forever. How you gonna cover your rent and pay for gas? And buy dog ​​food? Do not worry about me, guys. I've really got something here, I can feel it. See ya'. Metropolitan Museum. - Hey Tad. - How're you doin', Melinda? Hey, it's Max Mordon. - I'm his number one fan. - Really? Is Professor Humbert here? I need him to authenticate anything. Yes, he's in his office. And take him this while you're at it. It's urgent. Urgent, humm? Jeff, you have to wait here. Come on Tad, they're dead. They are not zombies. Thadeus, what brings you in today? Did you make another one of your discoveries? The discovery! I found at the new metro station site, today. I'm sure this is my first step to being the next Max Mordon. Don't even mention that creadon. He turns archeology into a media circus. Let me see. Second hand dealings not my field but let me have a look see. I read they're worth a fortune. I'll gonna' buy the best archeological equipment... - Unfortunately, it's just a replica. - What? Are you sure? A limited edition of 1999. Do not feel bad. As Thomas Jefferson said... in a thousand years will be a valuable archaeological find. Thadeus, my boy. I'm sure you'll find something valuable one day. Don't ever stop dreaming. Keep moving on like a rolling stone. Is that fromThomas Jefferson, too? No it's from Bob Dylan, but it's perfect, huh? Thank you Professor. But after finding a fake Coke bottle a piece of moon rock made of wood, an Etruscan a vase, made in China... My dreams are shattered. - Oh, I almost forgot. It's urgent. - Lavrof. Paititi. This crazy old man has found Paititi! He found what? I can't believe it, he found it. I've been waiting for this moment for more than 30 years, Thadeus Man you're patient. A key. More like half key. Now it seems that 30 years later... Professor Lavrof has found the other half. That's why he wants me to go to Peru. Wouldn't it be cheaper to just with FedEx it? Thadeus, this is the key to the golden city of Paititi. The biggest archaeological discovery since King Tut's tomb. Really? Awsome! - Rats! - What? The plane ticket is for today, 7 PM That's about two hours. - What am I going to do? - Don't worry about a thing. Tad Stone, on the case. So, tell me more about Paititi. See Thadeus, according to legend... 500 years ago, when the Incas discovered that the Spaniards wanted take all their gold... they asked Mother Nature for help. Mother Nature told them to take all the their gold to a secret place, Paititi. Once there, they hid treasure, and in exchange... Mother nature gave them a magic golden statue. Gold Indian of Paititi. A statue with magic powers. Whoever guards it will be blessed with the gift of immortality. So that they do believe that they live in the Lost City thanks to the magic power of the Golden Indian. So they are still alive? It's just a legend, Thadeus. But these tablets prove, that the city exists. Run. They're gonna' close the gates. Here, take this... as a momento. Belonged to Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones? Never heard of him, but Thanks that's cool. Good luck with your trip. Do you like it, Jeff? Drop it. Professor wait. Final boarding call for Doctor Jeremiah Humbert. Doctor Jeremiah Humbert... Professor, your bag CAUTION! Slippery, wet floor Professor. We need a medic. Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine I just need my pills. - Pills? Yes, right a way. Thanks, Thadeus. I do not know what I'd do without my blue pills. Your blue pills? - Pills for blood. - Sleeping pills. I'm feeling better already. Nothing can stop me from getting on that plane. Professor. I've identified the target. He has the tablet, I'm sending his photo. Perfect, I'll report it to the boss. Proceed with the plan. Sir, we've got access to the mass chamber. - Hello, are you an angel? - He'll be fine. Relax. We'll take him to the hospital and pump his stomach. Ok, I'll go with him. He just needs to rest for a few days don't worry. Take your flight Professor. I take good care of him. There are still hidden archaeological finds... in the most isolated places on the planet... Jewels waiting to be discovered that will shed light on mankind's past. Most of them see the light through the man of exceptional qualities... Sir Maximilian Mordon, possibly greatest explorer of our time. Max Mordon on the case. Max Mordon on the case. Professor Humbert can say what he wants, but Max is Mordon the bomb.. This program is sponsored by Super rich, super flavor, super health. The best for your , dog super cookies. - No, Jeff, stop it. - Would you care for more coffee, professor? Thanks. Professor Lavrof? Professor, Lavrof. Great to see you. Nice to meet you, professor Humbert. - I'm not Professor Humbert. - Perfect, I'm not Professor Lavrof, either. He sent me to pick you... I mean Humbert... up. Well, Professor Humbert sent me in his place. I'm Tad Stone. I mean, Professor Stone. I'll take good care of you, Professor Stone. - By the way, is there anything you need? - No thanks. I'm OK. Come on, my friend. Now, with Freddy.

Those guys took him and... Oh my God, they're kidnapping Professor Humbert. Not Humbert. He is... Nice mutt. The stone tablet. This is his back pack. Listen, boss lady I... C'mon, Freddy, to the car. This is... No but's Freddy. We we can't let them go. Come on, Freddy run! You're robbing the wrong man. I'm broke. I just got fired. Shut up. - Give me the tablet. - What tablet? We know you have it, Professor. Ok, A-I'm not a professor, I am a bricklayer. And B, I don't have it. And C, I know where it is. Step on it! Faster! You want us to get killed, boss lady? No way. Ok, How much do you want? Two hundred euros. And I get myself out of here, with my ex-wife and my savings. I'm not Professor Humbert. I swear. Professor HUMBERT. There's a perfecty logical explanation for this. There is also a logical explanation for that too. Wait. Before you turn my face into a Frappuccino... Check-out my passport. Cavalry, Freddy. At your service. Hey, Jeff. You're OK. - OK, you're not Professor Humbert. - That boss lady is what I've been trying to tell you. My name is Stones. Tad Stones. Professor Stones. - Humbert sent me in his place. - Really? That's weird. He never mentioned any Stones. Last minute thing. And you, who are you? I'm Sarah Lavrof. Professor Lavrof's Daughter. How long have you been working with Professor Humbert? - Not so long. I'm new. - Oh great, a rookie. Yes, well. But I've been digging since I was five. You don't look like a professor of anything. - That's because I am a man of action. - Oh really? Check-out G.I. Joe. Is that kind of welcome normal here? What do these guys want? Well, obviously Humbert's tablet. They must know you have it. You're in grave danger. Ah, it's OK. They don't scare me. Jeff stop! Oh my god. Ah don't worry, my room's pretty much like this sometimes. Do not be a fool. Those guys broke in. Jeff, come here. Belzoni. - Give me that. - Belzoni, what are you doing here? Here trade. Super Cookie. What's this? Dear daughter. Take care of this. I'm going to Machu Picchu. Do not let it fall into the wrong hands. - Tad, bring your bachpack here. - Yes, I'm coming! - Hey, isn't that... - The other half of the tablet. What's it say? I don't know. It's in ancient Chimu. My father and Humbert are the only remaining Chimu experts in the world. Belzoni, why are we going to Machu Picchu? Why? Come on bird. Speak up! What do you want? He's mute. And don't call him bird. He get's offended. Just our luck. A mute parrot with an attitude problem. Buzz off! Belzoni, focus. He's put on weight? He had a heart attack? He choked on a chicken bone , peanuts, a hairball. Someone's chasing him. Who's chasing him, Belzoni Belzoni, who? Hey, that's the guy in the SUV, who kidnapped me. - We need to do something. - So, what are you going to do? Call the police? And tell them what? ...that my father sent a mute parrot with a message? - No. I'm going to Machu Picchu. - That sounds dangerous. - Are you sure you shold go alone? - Are you offering to come along, Professor Stone? Well, offering... I wouldn't go so far as to... I'm in. - Let me help you with that. - Thanks. No problem, I'm totally yours. Totally. Hey, what are you doing here? I promised her father I'd look out for his daughter. And I get paid time and a half when I travel. As you know amigo, I have a family to feed. What time is it? Oh no. Good. I missed today's episode of My favorite series... - the lonely passion of Amber. - You'll live. Yes, but will Amber live after her experimental brain transplant... to help her forget Peter who broke her heart? What are you looking at? I'm trying to figure out what these signs mean. Professor Lavrof has been looking for this, all his life. - Why do you call your dad, "professor"? - As an archaeologist, he's the best. Totally. Driven, 24/7. Which kind of gets in the way of the father thing. - They have the tablet, sir. - Excellent. It' ll be great to find the last... - Miss Lavrof what an unexpected pleasure. - Have we met before? It's him! It's him! - I need that tablet. - Never. Got it! Thank you. No, you won't escape. No. Way to go, Belzoni! Stop that bird. Cheap kitchenware. The best in Peru. I'm trying to make an honest buck here. Give it to me. Look out! - It's on the roof. - Got it. Follow me! My bad. - Tad, my God. - I'm fine. Get the tablet. Get your filthy paws off me. - Where do you think you're going? - Upstairs? I'll give you a lift. Tad! We got it, sir. The vehicles are ready. Mission accomplished. Let's bug out.. Instant replay. Odessus. - Tad, I know who these guys are. These goons are from Odessus. - What's that? Pirates. They mustn't get the tablet. Belzoni, here. - Ha! - What you are you laughing at? Tad, look-out! Run! - We're alive. - Yes. What's that smell? It's not me, I swear. They are in the last carriage. Get them, I need that tablet. - Who are these Odessus guys? - They will seek treasures all over he world. Those guys lie, steal and even murder to get their hands on them. And then sell everything to the highest bidder. They don't care about history and culture. They just want money and power. Greedy pirates. If they find Paititi, and the legend of statue is true, they'll become immortal. We'll stop them. We'll find Paititi before they do. Hey guys, we got company. I think we lost them. - They are not the only one's lost. - Don't worry boss lady. This state of the art GPS with advanced Llamavision will take us wherever you want. ...for a little extra. - Come on, Freddy. I have a family to feed. Well, she's family, too. Ok, Machu Picchu. Come on my friends. Machu Picchu? - Wow awsome. - Ok, let's get to work On a second thought. I'll go to the village and grab some munchies while you guys get to work. Ok, we'll meet you later. Let's go Tad. Oh No. We're late. The Pirates of Odessus have been here first. They must have taken my father. - Don't worry Sarah, we'll find him. - Thanks, Tad. Let's look around. Maybe we can find some clue where they've taken him. Wait. This is Max Mordon. - You got to meet Max Mordon? - Well, actually I'm his number one fan. - No, you're not. Because I am. - Okay, sure, if you say so. - Can you help here please? - Yeah, sorry. But.. Look, I have a picture, personally signed. Me and Jeff stood in line for like 25 hours, just to get it. Is this is a #1 fan stuff, or what? - Who is Toad? - He misunderstood my name. - Anyway, how did you meet him? - He was one of the Professor's students. Is this guy your dad? So this must be your mother, she's pretty. She was pretty. She passed away. Now my dad is all I have left. I'm very sorry. Hey, wait. The photo! It was taken at Nasca desert. My father always said these ruins showed the way to Paititi; like a map or something. - But he never had the key for it. - But we do. The tablet is the key. That's why Odessus want it so badly. So, the next stop... The Nasca desert And now. If you buy a treasure pack 3000 in the next two minutes... you get a second one; shipping and handling absolutely free... terms and conditions apply because of the 3000 packs... It's market day, boss lady. Look, I got a burger for you. What's wrong, Belzoni? On the left, look. - It's them, Odessus. - How did they find us? Go! Spread out, I want them alive. Hey, come back. My balloon. Get the white hawks. Hit it, bird. DO YOU EVEN. - Do we really need to watch this, Freddy? - Of course, boss. Today, Amber will find out the secret real identity of her stepmother, Ginger. Listen, they're about to say it. Amber, you always believed I was your mother... but the truth is... I I am your father. What? Dear sensita. This is best chapter ever! The burgers are ready. The Nasca desert must be just over that mountain. I am really looking forward to meeting your father. I bet you're very proud of him. It is not easy to be the daughter of a scholar. They always pay more attention to their discoveries... than to the people who love them.. When I was a kid, my father was hardly ever at home. I barely knew my parents. When I was five, they had a car accident. My grandma raised me. It was my dad's. It's my good luck charm. Sometimes... I feel that he's not really gone. Like he's still watching over me. Oh! Check it out Jeff. The Nasca desert. Jeff are you all right? Hey, guys, I think Jeff is sick. What th... - Come on, boy. What's wrong? - Maybe he's hungry. This has to be serious. He doesn't react to super cookies. Boss, we have a problem here. - What's this, Jeff? - A tracking device. In their groin. - Professor. - Sara. - I finally found you. - You shouldn't be here. - I've come to save you. - Save me? I think you're just as much of a prisoner as I am. Is that's all you have to say? I come all this way from Cuzco to get you. - Me too. - Who are you? - Max, what are you doing here, are you all rightl? - Yeah, don't worry. These grave robbers have kidnapped me because I am the world's greatest expert in mummies and... - and sarcophagi of ancient Egypt. - Max Mordon, is it really you? They had to kidnap this clown. Of all people. Sweetie, I've never been more happy to see you. - Me you. - Me too. I'm your number one... number two, fan. And National Petro graphic subscriber since I was five. I didn't catch your name. Toad, Tad Stone. Professor Stone. Dr. Humbert sent him in his place. Professor? Really? Hey, amigo. Nice machine gun, but it looks old. Don't worry my friend. Let me introduce you to the brand new... Hyper performance 250. 50 bullets and two triggers for just... What are you doing? Dame, just give them what they want and I'm sure they'll let us go. Miss Lavrof may I have the tablet, please? You didn't bring it here, did you? Oh great, I can't believe it. What's he doing? This tablet is a key piece of the map that leads to Paititi. I've been waiting for this moment, my whole life. And now everything is in hands of these pirates. - Well, professor, your turn. - Never. I prefer to die. That won't work. Ok, you win. Leave her alone. From the black peak, the puma sees the red star. In the second moon of the rains, the water's trail goes over the anaconda's skin .. But don't trust the solid rock. For sometimes the alpaca's soft hair is stronger. The Red Star is Mars of course, the second moon of rain is, April... and Mars is in the northeastern quadrant during that time. There is a formation of basaltic rocks here. But don't trust the solid rock. - The babbling of an old shaman. - Got it. Let's mobilize. I'll take Mordon and the profesor. The girl stays as collateral. If her esteemed father doesn't cooperate, she's dead, ok? You better not lay a finger on her! Sorry, sorry. - Take care of yourself. - Max on the case. Trust me, dearest. If anything happens to my father, I'll never forgive myself I got into archeology so I could be closer to him. We'll get out of here, trust me. Don't trust the solid rock for sometimes the alpaca's soft hair is stronger. My father wouldn't ignore something like that. What he was trying to tell me? Don't even think about it, Freddy. Of course not boss lady. I am a businessman, not a thief. And this is good business. Check this out, there's something back there. - Behind the wall? - This is not a wall, This is a door. Believe me, I know what I am talking about. That's it. Don't trust the solid rock. The tablet was just the key to open it. Help me Sara. Freddy, can we get a hand here? In a minute, I'm doing an inventory. But, don't trust the solid rock for sometimes the alpaca's soft hair is stronger. This is alpaca wool. And this is the real map to Paititi. This is what my father was trying to say. - So the Odysseus guys - ... are going to dig in the wrong place. Well done Professor. Hey buddy, how did you get in here? Wait a minute, if your here it means there has to be a way out It's that way? - What th...? - - I didn't touch anything. Jeff, we have to find a way out. Hurry! And I have to decifer the map. Freddy do something, help Tad. Thank goodness, I never leave home without this. What's that? 101 ways of how to avoid a dying a horrible, miserable, escruciating, painful death. Step one, determine the level of visible risk. Are you seriously about to die? Or just over-reacting? Yes, we are over-reacting. Come on. The serpent and the tree, that's it. The snake's a river. Step two remain calm. Don't panic. Panic leads to hysteria hysteria and leads to desparation, and brings no solution. Dah, Is there anything actually useful in that book? - Step three, think outside the box - I would if we could get outside the box Wait, I think Jeff has found... The way out.. Spirals symbolize the air. Air, wind. That's it! Come on Jeff, focus. Step one, stay calm. - That was step two. - Ok, step two. You can't go on to second two, without doing step one first. And what was step one? I'll have a look. all this excitement, I... Trees are the earth, the river's water. Earth, water, wind and fire. - The mother of nature. - Step one. Forget it. Jeff, please we have no time! - Has the mut found the escape? - I hope so. Way to go Jeff. Step Four: If you find the exit. Use it. Yes, yes, all the symbols point to the jungle. Odessus are digging in the desert. I know where Paititi is, I know it. Come on Sarah, let's get out of here. - Well done Jeff, you did it, buddy.. - You're the best. Hey, Belzoni. You're still in one piece? You love her too, don't you? Ok step five, if escape is successful. Turn around and go home. - What? - Yes, I've had enough. We can't go now. The golden statue musn't... fall into the hands of Odessus. Well if I could get a big bonus for... working in these terrible conditions... Is that a "no"? We need to move fast before Kopponen realizes they're digging in the wrong place. Freddy, can you drive an excavator? $ 35 per hour, plus 20 cents a mile.. Forget him, I'm an expert. Hop on.. - How'd you learn to drive this thing? - Oh in the metro works.. - The metro works? - Yeah. - Sara Look, the truth is... - You worked on the Metropolitan Museum... excavation project? Wow. I'm impressed. They only choose the best. Yeah, that's how I roll. No mother you can't die now. You haven't finished your will yet. - We'll spend the night here. - Works for me, amigo. Don't worry, I'm sure your father will be alright. I'm just glad Max is with him. You must be excited about marrying Max Morden... possibly the most eligible bachelor on earth. Yeah, he's a good man: he's funny, handsome, famous... But he's such a workaholic; a lot like my dad. Well I'm sure he'll realize that being successful can't make you happy without someone you love to share it with.. I hope so. And you? Are you happy? Sure, I'm living my dream, of being an archaeologist. - How could I not be happy? - I like your attitude. Most archaeologists I know are only satisfied making big discoveries... which if they're really lucky, it only comes along once in a blue moon. But you're different. Are you for real? Yep, I think so. We should get some sleep. We'll have a hard day tomorrow. Sara, there's something I need to tell you. I'm not a real... - You were saying? - Never mind. Good night. - Hey, you, idiot. - I think he means to you. Better go before he turns you into Chop Suey. - Are you sure this is the place? - Of course I'm sure. And don't call me an idiot. You gorilla! ...just trying to make it believable. What if professor Lavrof lied? Not to me. I'm practically his son-in-law. Exactly, he doesn't seem to be fond of you. - Are you sure he doesn't suspect? - Trust me, I'm a celebrity. According to the hieroglyphics, this is it But there aren't any ruins here. It's been 500 years since anyone laid foot here The city must be hidden under the vegetation. If my prayers are answered, there will be pretty much shovels waiting there too. - Why don't we split up to look for it? - I agree. Jeff, come here boy. Great, another day without customers. Come on Jeff, nose to the ground. Tad, watch out. We've seen a puma. Really? No kidding? Freddy, give me a hand. Olé, maistro. - Guys! Guys! I found it! - What have you found? I found the lost city. 24 hours digging and still nothing. That old coot thinks he can toy with us? Make that idiot talk, now! Oh my God, the symbol of Paititi. It sounds hollow. Gotcha. And I'm not gonna let you go. - Stop playing with us professor. - This can't be the right place. It must be really deep. One, two, three, four... Eleven, twelve, thirteen... Wow, must be extremely deep. Now what? An earthquake? I should have listened to my horoscope. And that little voice in my head. "Do not get out of bed today." We are in deep dog poop. Sara. I read the map, the city is real. We found the entrance. Ok, prepare everything. I want to be entering that hole in 5 minutes. Dearest, thank goodness you're all right. I was so worried. Ok, squad two go down and clear the area. Squad one, get the girl and the professor. Squad Four, take care of those idiots. Tie them up. Don't worry about us. We'll be alright. Hey, put that away from me I know how to walk. Are you stupid? We can't let these guys live. They're no threat, the Peruvian one is a walking home shopping network. And the man in the hat is a brick layer. A brick layer? I don't care what the help they are. If they escape, they could compromise the whole plan. Coming, my sugar plum. - Which one? - Well, interesting. I think, given the position of the two entries... - it's most likely to be... - Even an idiot would recognize... the Incas marks The left one. Wait, before you kill us, can we have one last request? A super cookie. You, get out of there. Hey, the birds! - That's gotta hurt. - Hasta la vista baby. - And now to the temple. - I'm not going down there. They say there are very dead things in those Inca temples. Ok, then stay up here with Jeff and Belzoni. Great idea, boss. Good luck down there. Come on bird brain let's play poker. Help me dad. Sara? What was that? Spirits from the other side. Inca Spirits protesting the... profaning of this place. Tad? - Don't get any closer. - Should we kill him? - Of course. - Max? - I mean, of course not. - Of course, "yes". He's evil Sara. He ordered those goons to kill Freddy and me. I hope you don't believe him. He is a pathological liar. I'm not lying, I saw you giving the order. Oh, so you're not lying? And when you told Sara you're an archaeologist... ...you wern't lying either? - Tad, what's he talking about? - Come on, Professor Stone. Tell Sara who you really are. He's a construction worker. A bricklayer. A nobody. What? Tad, is that true? Ok, yes, he's right, I lied to you. I'm just a big phony. - But you need to know... - That's enough... Toad. Can't we just kill him boss? Boss? Max, what's going on? We don't have time for this, Max. Ok, Ok. Sara look, I'm doing this for me... For us. - For our future. - You kidnapped my father? It was necessary. We were never planning to harm him. You tried to kill Freddy and Tad. Well, I can explain. Sorry, sorry. You're going to regret that. Kopponen. The only thing I regret is the day I said I'd marry you. And to think you were my roll model. You're a fraud. Shut up you monkey. Move. How could I be so blind? How could I fall in love with a guy like that? It's not your fault.He fooled me, too. He's a liar. So are you. You've been lying to me all this time. I'm sorry Sarah. I tried tell you the truth... - But, I was afraid you wouldn't... - Forget Tad, You lied to me. I trusted you, I really trusted you. Sara, help me. - Take my hand. - Can you pull me up? Sure I can, but first tell me if anything you said about yourself was true. I was the Max Mordon's #1 fan. This must be the mummies' work. They're alive, I've seen them. Don't be silly. If they were alive, they wouldn't be mummies. - It's a contradiction in terms. - Whatever they are. - They're here. they're cheesed-off. - Well done monkey. You swine, you didn't care that we could have been killed down there To be honest darling, your father is the one who I really need. Now move. Look, keepus. The Incas used them to keep track of their supplies. White for silver, yellow for gold and brown for bronze. Oh don't look so shocked. I'm not a total ignoramus. So now what? Look, there. That has to be the entrance to the chamber of the golden statue. Pulling the right keepu, is our ticket in. Professor, enlighten us. Oh sure, like I'm gonna tell you. Okay, fine you worthless old fart. Yellow is gold. The whole room is a booby trap. Sara, professor, against the walls. - But he does not know what... - Just do it. You idiot! Kopponen, kill him. Tad, the red kepu. That's the right one. Sara. So long, suckers. Dad. The golden statue. Stop human. The golden idol is off limits. Prepare to die. Ok, ok, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I protected this statue for 500 years. And you're not going to be the one who steals it. Forgive me, please. I surrender. - Please don't shoot me. - Shoot you? This isn't a gun, It's just a... Now I will get eternal life. - Not so fast - Get lost, Tad Stones. Make me, Max "Moron". - As you wish. - Help, He..ll..p. - Are you alright sir? - You're a real life saver. This bag, is already dead. Do you think you gonna defeat my new pet? - Give it up, Toad. - Fight me, Mordon. - Max no. - Sara, welcome to the show. Today we're squashing a bug. This is the last time I have to worry about you... pathetic bricklayer. - Yes - No Too bad toad. Looser! - Now, he's gonna be immortal. - Don't get any closer, just wait. I'm full of life! What? What's happening to me? You may be immortal. But not as you would expect. This is the price for eternal life, Max "Moron". No, this can't be. - Sara, help me. - Get away from me. Don't worry, you're still quite handsome for a mummy, really. You'll fit in right in here. No, no, there must be an antidote to reverse this curse. No, there isn't. This is the reason why the mummie' s still live. Oh, oh, this is great, she's got mummy issues, too. Get some therapy, people. Take him here. Don't even think about it, Toad. My name is Tad. - What are you gonna do, kill him? - Pretty pointless if you to think about it. Oh my God, the treasure of the Incas. It is rich! Take him to our darkest cell. He'll enjoy eternal jail. What? No, no. Who do you think you are talking to? You can't do that. I'm Max Mordon... I am the most famous archaeologist in the world! What are you planning on doing with us? According to the manual, You should become a mummy... or die. - Hey, I saved your life. - But rules are rules. If I let you go, could you guarantee me you'll let us live in peace? This is my most valuable treasure. It belonged to my father. Please take it. This is my promise; no one will ever find out about this place. Keep it safe. You're the best living people I've ever met. Well, this is goodbye. - Have a good life. - You too, I mean... You know what I mean. A mute parrot who is also a card shark? I must be cursed. Now I have nothing, nothing! - Money isn't everything. - I am too broke to believe that. Hey buddy. Hey guys, you're back. And alive! - What happened to the bad guys? - They... gone. We didn't find anything. Everything's over. What about the golden statue? And the treasure? I afraid the legend of Paititi will be keep being a legend for a long time. So it was all for nothing? We are not going to be rich and famous? There's no need to be rich and famous Freddy. There are better treasures. The best one, is being with the people you love. Blah, blah, whatever you say. How will I explain to my family that I've traveled a 1000 miles... just only to sell a stinking Swiss pincher? Hey, I liked that Swiss pincher. Hey, are you ok? Yeah. The Lost City remains lost. By the way, we found so much more. Sorry about Max. It's not going to be easy to find another true hero. - I already have. - Really? Who? Stones. Tad Stones. - I dig you Sara. - I dig you too, Tad. Yo Jeff, through thick and thin, huh buddy. Fetch.
