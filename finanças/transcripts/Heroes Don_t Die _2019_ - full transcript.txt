OK, ready. - Are you filming? - Yes. Could you start over? From where exactly? From the vegetables... No, we don't care. OK. I'm coming back from market carrying two bags. I walk up rue d'Aligre next to the café where we always go, and turn right. And there, there's a guy... Does the noise bother you? Yes. We'll start again. And I turn right and see a guy sitting on the ground fifteen meters away... He's looking at me. As if he knew I was going to... go round the corner. You were looking at him, too? Yes, because I saw him looking at me. He stared intently at me. When I was 2 or 3 meters from him, he started to yell. "Zoran!" With a sort of Eastern European accent, half Russian, I dunno... "Zoran, criminal! You have killed! You have tortured!" I couldn't get it all. It was so muddled. - But he was talking to you? - Yes. I walked on, and behind me, the guy shouted: "August 21st, 1983! You were killed! You're dead!" Rather violent. Well... August 21st, 1983. That's my birthday. So what do you think? That you're really Zoran reincarnated as Joachim? That you're dead ever since you were born? Joachim... - It's not funny. - A bit though. It's improbable, OK, but it's not funny. The thing that's really not funny is what follows, what happens next. - What happens? - I go home, I do stuff all evening, try to forget the incident. It really got to me but I tried to think of other things. But during the night, the thing is... Move back. No, but the thing is, I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm naked, in the living room, covered in sweat, as if I'd just been swimming in a pool. And I start having flashes. I started to draw what I saw. This is what I'm wearing. I think I'm a soldier. - Look at this. - Blimey! I'm actually living this! Another suit. I can't get it out of my head. It's as if the guy had cast a spell on you. Not at all! It's me. I sense... I sense that this is me. It's not like a nightmare where you feel relieved it's over. This is different! I actually experienced this. Could I sleep here tonight? Joachim, are you OK? Are you having a nightmare? Can you hear me? You're freaking me out! Stop it, this isn't funny! Stop, you're freaking me out! Joachim? I don't know what happened... - It's OK, but you scared me. - It's everywhere, dammit. I don't know why I... What's that on your arm? I must have written it. It's like a code. 6, P, A, T, Y... H, A, U... Let me see. Wait. It's Cyrillic. It says Bratunac on your arm. It's a town. And... It's in Bosnia, next to Srebrenica. That's where I did my reports on the genocide. Is Zoran a name from there? Yes. How can we find out if I'm not already dead? You're so pale. You OK? Yeah, fine. HEROES DON'T DIE Alice, say something. What we now know. What we now know. Wait, it's rubbing... Hide this. Joachim, could you close the window? - We'll die from the heat. - No, the highway is too noisy. I hope I'm not too red. OK, I'm ready. So, to sum up. We have a name: Zoran. But no surname. We have a date of death: August 21st, 1983. It's also Joachim's birthday. This coincidence brought us here. What we know of Zoran, according to Joachim's dreams, and what the guy in the street said, is that he is either a criminal or a soldier. Perhaps both. The final clue is Bratunac, a town in Bosnia. We don't yet know the link between Bratunac and Zoran. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a place where he committed crimes. We are looking for tangible proof of Zoran's existence. So, we're looking for a grave. I'll redo the "looking for a grave". We're looking for tangible proof of Zoran's existence. So, we're looking for his grave. I'm just thinking out loud, here, but maybe if I wander the streets of Bratunac, perhaps someone will recognize me. Yes, it's true that... Well, people... People may recognize you. But it might just be a physical resemblance. But if we find Zoran's grave, and he really did die on August 21st, 1983, that's entirely different. Then it would be reincarnation. Can we open? I'm suffocating. - Joachim? - Yes? - Open the window! - Did you like what I said? What? Open it, I'm boiling. Speak up, I can't hear. Open the window, we're burning up! How long did it take you to learn Serbo-Croatian? I don't remember. I learnt it while living there. I didn't learn it from a book. If I used to speak it, I hope it comes back to me. What did you say? That if I used to speak it, it'll come back to me. You may speak it better than me. How do you feel, returning to Bosnia? Strange. Strange how? Just strange. Like your Zoran story. I feel like... The closer we get to Bosnia, the more my legs turn to jelly. Like with the guy at the market. So it makes me... Your initials are J.C.? - Yes, my name is Joachim... - It's crazy! 'Cos the real J.C. really was resurrected. Are you kidding me? Paul, stop filming, we're at the border. Jeez! There are so many graves. Imagine if Zoran had died in Sarajevo. Are those bullet holes? Looks like Swiss cheese! Were there any photos on the website? I kind of like it. It's really great. But there are only two bedrooms? It'll do fine. Great? It really looks alive, but it's dead as dead can be. Is it just me, or is there a weird smell? - No. - Can you smell it, Paul? I'll let some air in. Paul, we'll sleep... on the couch. I'll take this room. There! Like this, even if the set-up is a little... If you want to catch something live, I'll be here. But if you think something's happening and you want to catch it, and I'm not around, you can jump in, be independent. Paris, Bordeaux... Is it modulating? OK. Is it recording? Is the couch convertible? Usually, you pull and it turns into a bed. It's a corner sofa, Virginie. It's a bench. Paul there, and you there. You sleep like that... a bit staggered. It's not staggered. Can you feel your liver? No, I feel the end of my finger. I think there's... One of them's supposed to be the liver. Nothing? No. And now? - No? - No. Here too, normally. Be careful. Dammit, Paul! Look, you've broken it. Watch where you're stepping. We'll be in Bratunac in 50 meters. So, Virginie, can you... start recording. Paul too. You OK, Jo? It's right there. Here we are. Come on, let's go. Walk, walk. - Why is Paul staying in the trunk? - We're doing a shot. - What? - We're doing a shot. Come. But without the camera? Stay in the middle of the road. That's good. Cool. Can he see us from here? - My God... - Virginie! OK, I'll fetch him. I'll be back. OK, sorry! I think it'll look good. I wrote Zoran in Cyrillic. Will you follow me or...? - That's a nice one. - Who cares if it's nice? Have you looked here, Virginie? - Here? - Yes. But not here. It's been erased on some. Have we been there? Did you look there? I've found it! My God! Is this it? That's February. - What? - It's February '83. Dammit! How do you say August? Avgust. How do you write it? I haven't looked over there. - What? - There's a café called Zoran. Café Zoran. No, it's called "Kiklik". Back there, after the red thing. Let's park here and take a look. - Here? - Yes, that's great. Could you translate? What? She knows what's written on her T-shirt! I just want to tell her... Translate the rest. She doesn't speak English. Translate! Even I don't understand what you're saying. I just want to tell her I'm looking for a Zoran. Nothing, nothing. - Ništa,what? - Don't worry. Think through what you want to say first. Damn, I think that's... - She's calling Zoran. - I'm watching the match. Could you come here, please? Hello. Hello. - Say his name is Zoran. - I'm getting there. Easy. Do you understand? Zoran. Dean - Deana. Yovan - Yovana. Goran... Gorana. Is this familiar to you? Do you recognize this place? Virginie, it's best we don't hear you now. Are you OK, Paul? I feel like I'm in a freak show. Want me to twirl my cock for you? Beat it! Joachim? Shit! Are you done acting crazy? Virginie? Virginie, come here. What? Do you believe this? Joachim as Zoran crashing into the plants? It's not a Trivial Pursuit question. Do you believe it or not? Yes, I do. Wait for me here. How long has it been? Eight, nine years? I've lost track of time and space. I didn't think you'd come back. Neither did I. Do I have to speak English all the time? Depends, is your Serbo-Croatian coming back? I feel like I've been fooled. "War isn't pretty. It causes damage..." OK, I get it. - I'm not a total moron. - What do you want? I know this isn't Care Bear Land. Are we doing a film about me? Or a report? Just a second. Paul, come here. Come here. Come here, Paul! I think Joachim wants a biopic. Is that what you want? OK, let's do it. Film him! Paul, film him. Well? In my life as Zoran, I died in 1983. For everyone's mental health, let's say that Zoran died. OK, if you want. But he died 10 years before the war broke out. So it has nothing to do with me. - With Zoran! - With Zoran. I mean... I never knew your pal's war. Not you. Zoran! I was already me. I was 10. I was in Vendée, in Mouilleron-le-Captif. I only saw that war on TV. Are you listening to yourself? For Christ's sake, Jo! We're not the only ones looking for ghosts here! Shit! Here's the list of victims of July 11th, 1995, who will be buried in 2018. Alic Musama Omer, born in 1963. Alic Redge Muhamed, born in 1978. Alisevic Abdulah Farudin, born in 1972. Avdic Osman Asulaj, born in 1962. Beganovic Hasan Azim, born in 1974. Cheers! What's wrong with the music, dude? It's the rotten Chinese mixer! Pile of crap! Goddam Chinese piece of shit. Don't drink so much of that stuff. You'll get sick. I'm already sick. We wouldn't be here if you hadn't made all this up. What did you just say? That you made all this up. You all think that? Why are you here, then? Why did you bring a whole crew? You haven't seen a cardiologist in 10 years. And I clearly remember what he said. He said from the age of 35, you could die at any moment. You're turning 35... in one month. Go ahead, Paul. Film this. It's pretty hardcore. - Fuck! - What's going on? Joachim, are you OK? Did you hurt yourself? I'm fine. Leave it a little longer. It's just slow. Goddam, it pisses me off. The machine is just slow. - Did you hear me? - Yes. Wait. I'll make the coffee. It won't work, with the steam and all... Dammit! Joachim? - What are you doing? - Shit! Are you packing? What? You're packing? Why are you packing? I know he won't get better. That his heart isn't working well. That he can't be operated on. What do you want? For me to hang myself? - Let's finish this film. - There is no film! You're doing the sound. You hear what we're saying? Don't you see he made it all up? Do you want me... to let him think that reincarnation exists? Like: "Don't worry, I'll be back next week." I'm going to pack. Virginie? What? I just wanted to make a film for him. Well, do it then! This is totally insane! Paul, from now on, film all the time. You owe me money. Sure. What does he want? Nothing. Forget it. ZORAN TADIC August 1983 Alice, you have to pay me. I made you a tomb. There's the tractor and the gas. And if I'm in your film, that'll cost you, too. Who the hell was I? Why was I buried here? There's nothing here. Not even... Not a flower or a candle. We know his surname. Tadic. Right, Zoran Tadic. There are tons of them. Zoran Tadic. Serbo-Croatian. Philosoviu. Must be a philosopher. In my dreams, he killed people. He won't be on the Internet. Why not? But... Everyone's on the Internet. The dead and the living. We've been led here. That will continue. But how? By signs... Could we go to Bratunac town hall? This was a war zone for five years. So... the archives are gone. The memory of people went up in smoke. There must be people who knew him. If he died in '83, there must be people who met Zoran. There's not only the memory of the dead. Some people must remember him. I might have an idea. I like all your posts on Facebook, and you never like mine. I never go on Facebook. I thought you were different. But you're not. Your job is to film me, not to love me. I think of you often. If that wasn't so, I wouldn't be here. But you've come with your camera. Come on, try my baklava. I made it yesterday, as if I knew you were coming. Try it. What's your husband doing? Tell him to come and try my baklava. Jo? Want some baklava? It's quite sweet, but it's good. I've been here before. - What do you mean? - I recognize it. What's going on? - What's he saying? - What? Nothing. He doesn't look well. Is he leaving? You can smoke inside. He doesn't have to smoke outside. You can smoke inside. No need to smoke outside. This isn't Europe. Europe doesn't want us. We like Europe, Europe doesn't like Bosnia. Ask her if I've been here as Zoran. - Are you nuts? - Just ask her! Here, you can smoke until you die. I survived the war, your cigarette won't kill me. Sit down and smoke. Sit down. I recognize this place too. Do you all have Alzheimer's? It was in my film, you saw it at my place. - What's with her now? - I recognize the lady. She looks like she's going to faint. Give her some water. Baklava? - Now I remember. - We got it, Virginie. Water? No, thanks. I'm sorry. She needs some baklava. You all act as if my house was haunted. Here, and some water. That's kind of you. Thank you. Drink some water. Don't be afraid. Put down your cigarette. He needs an ashtray. Look at all this rain! Is it like this over there? It's been like this all summer. Give me that. And you, put down your cigarette. This little one is my nephew. This one too. This is my husband. And him, he's my Nino. They were all killed on July 11th, 1995. I can't take it anymore. How many times have I told this story in the past 23 years? And how many times did you film it? Aren't you tired of hearing the same old story? My life... stopped on July 11th, 1995, along with theirs. What about your life? Will you spend it filming the dead? Why don't you film the living? Were you born here, Hajra? I was born just over there, in the house opposite. And I will die in this one, God willing. I haven't traveled far. Do you know everyone here? Of course. This is a village. Did you know a Zoran Tadic, who died in '83? Tadic... It sounds familiar. But Zoran... There is a Tadic who has a junkyard on the road to Kamenica. But he's not dead. He's in his fifties. Could he be the son of your Zoran? Apparently, you have a son. Who has a junkyard. I have a son? He's in his fifties. His son is so old... Wait, there's another Tadic, a widow. I think she's always been a widow. She makes honey, out by Milici. People say it's good. She may be dead. But if she's still alive, she could be the widow of your Zoran. And you have a wife. Who makes honey. What do you want with this dead man, for God's sake? I don't know. Thank you. - Is it good? - Very good. My God, he looks so sick. I'm going to get some air. - Shall I call a doctor? - No. Everything's fine. If you say so. I'm not so sure. - What? - The bed's so small. So... we sleep together...? She thought it right, I told her you were my husband. - Move over. - That I was your husband? Yes, move over. Why did you say I was your husband? - Why did you say that? - It's simpler. I see you can't sleep either. I was reading something. How exactly does your reincarnation thing work? Does a person have to be born the day the other one dies? Is that right? I don't really know. If you came all the way here, you must believe in it. I came to check it out. But I'm not sure of anything. My Nino died on July 11th, 1995. They also killed his father. They killed... over 8,000 people that same day. So I was thinking... if they were all reincarnated into flowers, I would easily recognize my Nino's scent. My children... I would so love to tell myself a story like yours. It's much more beautiful than the one in my head. In there, it's all over forever. I'll let you sleep now. Goodnight. What did she say? She said it's good to tell yourself stories. That they're always better than life. TADIC'S JUNKYARD Excuse me. Where is Tadic? Where is Tadic? Thank you. Who are you? Hello. What's going on? What's the camera for? Who are you? What? I don't understand. What? I don't understand. What's with the camera? Don't touch me! Stop! Stop! Get the hell out of here. - That's enough. - Tell him in Serbo-Croatian! At least the generational order. I don't understand what you're saying. Please, sir. She's trying to tell you that... - Reincarnatia! - Our friend is your father. He's your father. That faggot is my father? Reincarnatia! I'm asking you to leave. He's going to hit us. Jo! Leave! Come on, we're leaving. Enough now! - Want me to guide you? - Want to drive? If you do, it's fine by me. I don't want to get bogged down. You don't get bogged down in the rocks, but in the mud! That's the idea. Damn! We're not equipped for this! We don't even have seatbelts. So? Do you see any cops? - Do you? - Do you want us to overturn? - We're doing 2 km/h! - 2 km/h... I know how to drive! You haven't driven at all so far. Strange. See, there it says "other roads". Perhaps we can't get there... with the van. But we'll go anyway, right? It's raining. There's washing out. Someone lives here. Alice? Yes? There are beehives. Didn't you say my wife made honey? Yes. This must be the place. Wait, what should I tell her? Let me think. We can't just turn up and hug people right off. It's not surprising they react badly. What we say sounds crazy. It's not surprising the guy reacted violently. So I think this time... we need to be a little more... more delicate. And... We shouldn't hope someone will recognize you. You're not the same person. It's crazy that you're a person who died 35 years ago and who has come back. It's only normal. All we can hope is that this person you loved, who was important to you, felt something, love, even if she doesn't know why. Do you see? When you go inside, look as if you recognize things, the house, objects. And her above all. She's your wife, you loved her. But she can't recognize you. No way. Her husband who died 35 years ago, who returns... And you don't even speak the language anymore. So it's normal she doesn't recognize you. That's what is beautiful. That never happens in real life. When you lose someone, it's forever. They never return 35 years later to say, even if you don't know where the words come from, to tell you... I dunno. All the things he couldn't say... when you were in the same life. All the words he didn't say for reasons that remain obscure... which make people pass each other by. And... I think that is the heart of the scene. It's a guy who comes back to see a woman he truly loved and he wants to say something to her, but... they don't speak the same language, so he can't use words. Actually, he'd like... to live again, for a while. To be with her again. But once death has separated them, it's no longer possible. Never again. All the love plays out... separately for each person. Understand? Yes, I understand. Will you be OK? Yeah, I get it. - Where's the door? - I don't know. It's your house. Who's there? What should I do? Take her in your arms. Are you handsome? She's asking if you're handsome. Say yes. Yes. I can't see you. Are you handsome? Yes. I can tell... you're looking at the photo. The uniform. It's... It's exactly like the one I drew. Every detail. The star... It's the one I keep seeing. But his face has faded. One glass of raki, to stir the flames of love. More than two puts them out. He was handsome. Like a god. He was handsome. I can no longer bear to see you hanging on a hanger. Never could I bear to see you hanging on a hanger. Go on... Leave. HEROES DON'T DIE
