What belongs into a good soup? A good soup. A good soup takes time. First and foremost, it takes times. It must cook slowly. All ingredients shall mix and become one. And this way a new flavor emerges from all the different flavors in the end. If the ingredients are correct. Birthe, that sounds like... You were dreaming again, haven't you? Of him again? He rode towards me on a white horse, dressed like a hunter and took me with him to his realm. "Come," he said. "Come with me. At my place, it is warm and bright. You will be as happy as you have never been before in your life." Little princess, little princess. Now you will please shake your pretty little head for me so that this entire childish dream including all its silly ideas tumbles into your Brussel sprouts over there. Birthe, those are not silly ideas. To me it feels like I really met this king. - A dream is a dream. And men are... And riders on white horses... Riders on white horses. They're pipe dreams. Now stop dreaming, my child. But Birthe, what would life be like without dreams? Oops? A nut at this time of year? Please Highness, at least look at it. You must marry again so we will have a queen. Go away with the little picture. It is of no use. And this sun of beauty? What do you think of her? Eyes like black stone. Teeth like ivory. - Is she an elephant? Then her. A goddess sprouted from the sea's foam. The hair flows like ebb and flow over her shoulders. - Richard, please. When will you finally understand? There is no one on earth who compares to my beloved wife. And if you would find one after all, she would not have her golden hair after all. Yes, yes, Majesty. Fine and dandy. Dandy and fine. But life goes on. You should... - No, no! I promised my wife when she died to only marry someone who is as pretty as she was. And who has just as golden hair as she has. I gave her my word, as king and as husband. And now, leave me alone! You. How could it be? Majesty, are you feeling well? I have not been feeling this well in a long time. Majesty, wait. Wait. Majesty, what...what is going on with you? Look. There stands... my queen. But that is your daughter. Father. You here? I finally found you. But I was never gone. Princess, we wanted to go to the kitchen. Kitchen! We did? - Yes! Cooking soup. Brussels sprouts. - Stay here! Or do not. To the throne room. Come to the throne room and listen to what The King has to tell you and the world. No. No, that's no right. - Be quiet, chef. Not a word. To the throne room. I finally found you. Found again. My queen. I want to marry my daughter. Because she is the dead ringer of my deceased wife. And otherwise I cannot find a bride who compares to her. God forbid that a father marries a daughter. And the realm will be pulled along into ruin. - Quiet! No one can change my mind. I will and want to marry my daughter. Please wait, father. Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses. One as golden as the sun. One as silver as the moon. And one as sparkling as the stars. Furthermore, I demand a cloak made from thousands of furs. And every single animal in your realm must give a piece of its skin for it. These are my conditions. What she demands is absolutely impossible. - Thank heavens! Your wish, my dear, is my command. I will fulfill your every dream. The most skilled maids in my realm shall weave your dresses for you. One as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as sparkling as the stars. My hunters will hunt every animal in my realm and will take a piece of skin from each of them. And from that a cloak will made from thousands of furs for you. And then we will marry. Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses. One as golden as the sun. One as silver as the moon. And one as sparkling as the stars. Furthermore, I demand a cloak made from thousands of furs. And every single animal in your realm must give a piece of its skin for it. Here is everything you demanded from me. And tomorrow shall be the wedding. Do you not still want to change your mind and heart? There is nothing to change. Then whatever happens now cannot be stopped anymore. Don't you want to say goodbye to me at all? Birthe, of course. I am looking for you. - Best of luck, my child. Best of luck on your way. - Thank you. Birthe? Did mother really want father to marry me? - But no. Of course not. She just wanted The King to marry a good woman. One with a golden heart. Look. She asked me to take care of this and give it to you when the time has come. Ring, spinning wheel and clock reel will help you to find the right man. Your rider on the white horse. With the ring, you give him a promise. With the little spinning wheel, you spin fine threads that connect you to one another. And with the little golden clock wheel, you'll coil up the threads in a clean manner. How nice. And now, hit the road. Otherwise he might catch you. He will not stop me anymore. Never again. Shoo, shoo. Hey, look what kind of quarry is hiding there. What do we care about the animal in the branches? - I am interested. And? It is an odd animal of which we have never seen the likes before. And on its skin are thousands of furs. But it's laying there sleeping. If it sleeps, then shoot it dead and skin it. - No. Catch it alive, then tie it up and take it along. No, do not! A rider on a white horse. It's not animal, Majesty. It's a girl. A girl. - Is she pretty? Who are you? I am just a poor child abandoned by mother and father. Have mercy on me and take me along. Father and mother should rather have cleaned. Indeed, she is dirty. Tell us, girl, why did you dress up like a little bear, hm? Very funny. Pretty cheeky. Take her along. She shall sweep up the ash in the kitchen. She? In the kitchen? - She shall help in the kitchen. Take her with you. Move, little fury animal. Didn't you hear what The King said? Come on. Hey, what's going on? Back there you can sleep and live, little fury animal. Put your things down there and then go to the kitchen. [sings about cooking] Come in, as long as it's not a cutthroat. What brings you to the realm of Matthis the Chef? I am supposed to help here. Help? You? Do you know how to cook? - A little bit. It learned it at home from my...mother. Learned at home? Well then you surely know what belongs into a good soup. No, I have not learned soup yet. Only Grützwurst and Labskaus. What we poor people eat. But the soup comes first in every cuisine. The first thing people cooked was soup. And that's why I'll explain to you first what belongs into a good soup. It may sound easy but the easy things are often the most difficult ones. A good soup... ...takes time. First and foremost, time. It must cook slowly. All ingredients must mix together. And this way a new flavor emerges from all the different flavors. A new one. Something that never existed before Why are you smiling like that? - I am happy because I can still learn something from you. Just like at home. Well don't be happy just yet. Because you'll do all the bad work first. Pluck the poultry. Clean the vegetables. Get wood, water, and stir the fire. And take of the cloak. You're suffocating under all that fur. - No, I will keep the cloak on. I will be cold otherwise. You feel cold? In the kitchen? If you say so. [Literally: That may understand who wants to.] Welcome, Allerleirauh! [Literally: all kinds of fur] Too bad we did not shoot the deer. - And? What quarry has been hunted today? - Animals and little animals and... She does not care. My dear Riekchen, you get more and more beautiful with everyday. And that? Is that your newest prank? Yes, imagine. He cast an eye at her. - But she snubbed me, unfortunately. See you later. - See you later. Hey. What are you gawking like this? Rather help us out of these boots. Yes, come here, Allerleirauh. Remove your king's boots. Now come on, dirty scut. - How long am I still supposed to wait? Grab tightly. Good, little animal. And now, alley-oop, catch it! Did not catch. We seem to still have to practice. - Allerleirauh, where are you? It is your turn. I need the water to cook. Do you wish to throw the boot at me, Mister King? Go to the kitchen. Clean the boots later. - Killjoy. Weird, this girl. - That The King tags along. When he's usually totally different. Kind, just. With a big heart for all of the people in his realm. It is alright, Matthis. It does not hurt. It doesn't hurt. Of course, it hurts. Here, here in the heart it hurts. I will teach these horse beans some manners. [Literally: pig beans] Your little sister will come in a moment, my dear. But first I must discuss something with you. You know I love you like a brother. We have been friends since our childhood. But because you are The King... Rasmus, please not that same old story. Leave me alone with that. I am hungry, Allerleirauh. Hungry like a bear. Jakob, you will listen to me now, please. It is about your future, the realm's future. It is time for you to marry. Now. I sent messengers to Princess Larissa. She will attend our ball. Why for Heaven's sake should I already get married now? And why Princess Larissa? Because she will not wait for you forever. And because with her as wife, you will be the first among kings in this world. Your realm united with hers reaches from the North Sea to the South, from the ocean to the broad expanses of the East. Rasmus, I do not care about any of that. If I will marry one day, if... then it will be a woman I love. Do you understand? Love. A true queen. Of beauty and a heart bigger than all realms on this earth. You do not talk like a king, you babble like a dreamer. - I do speak like a king. What do you think about it? What is more important? Mind? Beauty? State politics? You ask me, Majesty, but you do not expect an answer. Hey! Stay here. The King asked you something. - Yes, I want to hear your answer. Mind and dress belong together, my king. Mind and dress belong together. Did you expect such a line from our little bear? Exactly that, stupid nonsense. Who oversalted the sauce? Hey, do not run away. I am scared alone in the dark. We are tired, Rasmus. Tired. Come on, go to sleep. Jakob also wants to go to bed already. Your brother. Your brother, Friederike, is a sleepyhead. But we should, we should drink. She is his sister. The magical little fury animal that oversalted my food. I did not. - I am supposed believe that? Then tell me, why are you always hiding in your cloak? Are you hiding your face? What are you up to? - Nothing. I am hiding nothing. Lies. Nothing but lies. Look at me, Allerleirauh. Bear girl. The King orders you to look at him. Well, is it alright this way? You scare me. Can I still be at your service, my king? Give me a little dance, odd child. How you dance, Allerleirauh... ...like a princess. And the hand writing too. Like a princess. - Forgive me, my king. With the little ring, you make him a promise. With the little spinning wheel, you spin the threads that connect you with one another. And with the clock reel, you will coil up the threads in a clean manner in the end. My, my, Allerleirauh! Must I be worried? Why worry, Matthis? Because you're in love. The most beautiful man wildly haunts the little head. Nonsense. You are drunk. - I'm not drunk. I'm deadly sober. Take care with the salt! Now that you're in love... We don't want The King to complain again. Wait a moment. I think you have fallen in love with our king. It's The King. Please, Matthis, it is enough when they mock me and throw boots at me. I'm not throwing anything at you. And most definitely, no boots. How beautiful your hands are. Like those of a a lady. Put the fur into the corner. Show yourself to the world. Then everyone will fall in love with you. They must see you. Once, Matthis... Once I have been seen by someone and I... Sorry, Allerleirauh. I didn't want to offend you. [Literally: step to close to you] You look gorgerous, dearest little sister. The ball should be given in your honor. - Yes, but it is your ball, dear brother, hm? This is about matters of the state. - That is the issue. If I just had not let Rasmus coax me into this. Come, we will just run away. Stay here. Come. Magic, how you do all of this. Today nothing will be oversalted. Today the people shall be pleased. Pleased? They will celebrate you, Matthis. Give three cheers to you. No one will celebrate the chef, little fury animal. And also not its little fury animals. We have to do that ourselves. The lamb was little bit too long in the oven. What do you think? It was wonderful, Matthis. Soft like butter and fine, not the slightest bit dry. And salmon-colored on the inside like painting. Seriously? You know something about cooking, Allerleirauh. One must leave that to you. Matthis? Can I go upstairs and watch the feast for a bit? I want to stand outside the door. Just go. But you'll be back in half an hour and sweep up the ash. I will be back in a moment. Take off the fur. Or they'll laugh about you. King Jakob, it is a joy and an honor to me to introduce you to Princess Larissa. Enchanté, Princess. I am delighted. As am I, Highness. I had the chance to marvel at your magnificent realm. Everything is in the greatest order. The barns are full, the farmers are diligent. I hope you will feel comfortable at our feast. We prepared everything so that we...that w... Who is that? My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful. I think I am tired from the journey. May I have this dance? I feel like...like I am dreaming. And I am a dream weave? - No, no. I just do not know what is happening with me. I believe I am floating. Then take me as a dream, King Jakob. The entire life a dream. - Only a dream? No. No, never. Who are you? What is your name and where are you from? Too many questions. How am I supposed to find an answer so quickly for so many questions? Wait! Where are you going? Wait for me! It is a tragedy, a realm's tragedy. You alienated her. Leave me alone with your state politics. Bring her here. Get a doctor for your brother. He...he is no longer in control of himself. You are wrong, Rasmus. He has never been clearer than now. I am back. Alright, little fury animal. Come here now and cook the soup for The King. You know how to. I also want to go upstairs for a bit and watch. But don't drop a hair in the soup! Or there will be nothing to eat anymore. Do not worry, dear Matthis. No hair will fall into the soup. With the ring, you make him a promise. Oh the little brother struggles with a thousand questions. Where is she? Why did she run away? Did I maybe make a mistake? Have mercy on me, Friederike. I am suffering. She entered like an epiphany. I looked at her and I felt like I had seen her somewhere else before. As if he already knew each other. And then... this dance, this dreamlike dance. And then..then she runs away from me. Why? And at the same time, it is as if she is still in this room. As if...as if she is still standing here. You have fallen in love, Jakob, like never before in your life. But she ran away. Why? If she will ever come back? What is going on with this soup? I have never eaten such a good soup before. That is how it is to be in love. What is that? - A ring? The chef shall come. At your service. I volunteer, most honorable Highness. I wish to serve. Was something wrong with the food? A hair in the soup? Who cooked the soup? - The soup? I cooked the soup with my own spoons, with my own hands so to say. Wasn't it good? It was... ...wonderful. But you did not cook it! Because it was cooked differently and much better than usual! Better than usual? Better than my soup? How is that possible? I must admit I didn't cook the soup but the furry little animal. The furry little animal cooked it. But she followed my recipe. Allerleirauh? Bring her here! Who are you? I am only a poor child who lost father and mother. For what are you at my castle? I am of no use than to throw boots at my head. Look at me! Where did you get the ring from that was in the soup? - I know nothing about the ring. Tell the truth. I am your king. You are my king and I know nothing about the ring. No one has seen this bitch. It is as if she disappeared into thin air. Impossible that a soup tastes better than mine. It is really... It really tastes... ...a little bit better. It's a damn palate tickler for a palate lecher. This soup is a culinary tragedy! On top of that, you let a hair fall into it! You'll be beaten for this. There was no hair in the soup. And I only cooked it the way you taught me. You prepared it differently. There's this special ingredient in there, the ingredient I don't have. And that's why it tastes better than all the soups I've ever cooked. The soup is a dream. And you even more so. We are reading now, hm? Reading books, poems. What kind of behavior is that? I enjoy it, dear friend. But I still do not understand some things. This right here for example. "Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues." "Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues" [Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor] Why understand this nonsense? It confuses the mind. From morning to night, you talk about nothing but love, longing, desire. The realm is perishing due to your craze. On the contrary, Rasmus, the realm will thrive It will become bigger/greater and stronger. Here. "Because love is the greatest of all." It is a craze, a dream for dreamers and fools. The reality... Nothing is more real, Rasmus. Even you will understand that one day. And I will host a second feast so she will come to me again. May heaven grant us that this lady never appears at our court again. What pretty eyes you got, Allerleirauh. That I have never noticed it before... Compliments for the dirty clump as if she was highborn lady. Jakob, this broad made a clunk out of you. Neither fool nor clunk. If I just think about her, I feel like a king. Hey dirty clump, what is there to hum about with a soft voice? At your service. You are at my service, are you not? Clean my boots. But quickly. I am getting the cleaning utensils. - You will stay here! Use the fur, your hands. Kneel. Begin. Why are you gawking like this with your beautiful eyes? Do you want to feel the whip? Do you? Rasmus! Leave her alone! I am only putting her in her place. - You will not touch her. Do you understand? You will not touch her. And you...go to the kitchen. When she comes, I will give you a sign and you will take her before The King sees her. I still must have a word with this lady. Everything is done, Matthis, I would love to... - ...go upstairs? Stand in front of the door? I would love to do that. Well then go for God's sake. But don't let yourself be caught. Who should catch me? - Rasmus. He wants to keep the unknown lady from coming to the feast. There are guards and soldier at every door. Make sure they won't mistake you for her. Who would mistake me for her? You'll be back in half an hour and cook the soup for The King which he likes to eat so much. "Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues. Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues." And I already feared you would never come back. Why? If a king is waiting... This poem... ...I know it, too. I know. You know that? How? Magic. Did you put the ring in my soup using magic? Is it your ring? How should my ring get into your soup, sir? How could I have your soup be served on my ring? I do not know. But I would like to know. What is your name? Lotte. - Lotte. Lotte. Lotte, I know you from somewhere. From the last feast, right? No. I have already known you for longer. I have already known your for longer, too. Wait for me! Do not run away again! Lotte, her name is Lotte. Lotte? Lotte? You make go crazy with this person. Maybe she wants to test you? Test me? Why? - To test your love. About Love. Love. This is about state politics, the realm. I spoke with Princess Larissa again... - Stop it with Larissa. No more word about her. I do not understand you. I must admit, admit again, that I didn't cook the soup. The furry little animal cooked the soup. Like the time before. Bring her here! You summoned me? Can you explain it to me this time around? No, I know nothing of the spinning wheel. Tell me. For what are you at my castle? Did Lotte send you? I am of no use but to throw boots at my head. I am speaking of this golden spinning wheel and of the golden ring. How did they get into my soup. Tell me now. You cooked the soup. I am only a poor child who lost father and mother. Yes, you are only a poor child. - Jakob! Well, well, well, he touches her, she touches him. Go to hell! [Literally: to the devil] I have heard enough of your lies. You taint your regality if you treat the lowest so nefariously. How are you speaking to The King? Get out of my sight! Leave! Leave! - Yes, I am leaving. Heavens! She is a proud as a princess. Princess... - Indeed. Like a princess. Don't do something stupid, furry little animal. You don't want to leave your Matthis? What am I still supposed to do here? - Get water. Stir the fire, sweep up the ash and laugh about The King. And show me how to cook a good soup. You do not need me for that, Matthis. He screamed at me, flung me on the ground... The King...The King... The King is confused, the good guy. Because of her. It has nothing to do with you. He is a good king. With a good heart. And that is why he flung me on the ground? No, of course not. Stay. Please. For me. What am I supposed to do around here without you? And you, where do you want to go? You've got no one except me. Without you... ...I will feel cold in the kitchen. The oven will keep you warm. Your warmth, furry little animal, is what I need. Well come, get wood. I'll cook us something. Come to the kitchen. Come here. Sit with me at the table, pretty as gold furry little animal. Sit down. And enjoy your meal. Thank you very much, Matthis. It tastes even better than usual. Yes, this time I also used this special ingredient. With it, every dish comes out even better. Matthis, you are like a father to me. Like a real father. Since I have no father anymore. Then let me be your father. Allerleirauh. Do not run away. I am not running away. I am just doing my job. Please wait. I just wanted to... Did you want to ask for forgiveness? - Please wait at last. I order you to wait! How can I be at your service, my king? Do you want fling me on the ground again? I wanted to ask, what do you do with such a spinning wheel? With a spinning wheel you spin threads out of fibers. No, that is not it. She means something different. They also say that with the threads that connect man and woman with one another are spun with a spinning wheel. But yes, that's it. Thank you, odd girl. Matthis is waiting for me. That cannot be. One last feat, Rasmus. A third feast. I want wine and dance which last longer than any dance ever danced before. Please no. Not another feast so the unknown lady comes here. - No back talk. Who knows if we really do not know her. So we already know her? Please tell me: Who is she? How great is her realm and where is it located? Wait for it. The third feast is only for her. There you are finally. You are short of everything. Clean the vegetables. No. No. First, decorate the roast. I'll stir the sauce in the mean time. Do not be mad at me, Matthis. - I'm not mad at you. Nevertheless, you'll not attend the feast tonight, Why am I not allowed to stand in front of the door again? Because there's trouble constantly. One time the soup tastes too good, another time a ring or a little spinning wheel is in it. And in the end, The King flings you on to the ground, ,shakes you, beats you and breaks your heart. But he did not beat me at all. And my heart... You won't change my mind, Allerleirauh! This ball will happen without you. Tell Rasmus, he should send all our guests home. The feast is over. Wait, she will come. - No, I scared her away. It is pointless to wait. Everything is pointless. Come here. Sit down, Allerleirauh, drink something with me. It is so important, Matthis, because I... - Because you're a witch? And always put something into the soup so it becomes so good that it tastes better to The King than anything I cook? No, Matthis, I must attend the feast, My life, my happiness depend on it. I don't believe that. I have already taken two steps. I must take the third one now. If everything goes well, I will take off my fur forever. I promise. You'll take off the fur? Promise? Then go. Here. Go. I am giving up. It is pointless. Pointless? I do not believe that. I thought you vanished for always and forever. Why are you always so anxious, my king? Because I have been too blind for too long. I saw you and did not recognize you. What do you mean by that? Like I said. Blind. Do you understand? Like a blind man who does not recognize who stands in front of him. Do you really want to leave once again? And what is in it this time? I think I already know it beforehand. Beforehand? - Here. You finely coil up the thread with the clock reel. Do we engage in needlework now? - Oh Rasmus, you are and always will be an ox. She shall come. Get Allerleirauh. - Not the chef? Allerleirauh shall come. Allerleirauh... Did you cook the soup again? As good as I can. Will you tell me this time? Who are you? Why do you ask... if you already know it? May I? My Lotte. I do not believe it, the dirty clump is... - ...a true princess. I knew it. Now I will never let you go again. You are my dear bride and we shall never be separated again. No, never ever again. [The End] Will you tell me your whole story now? And if it is as long as the path I had to go to be finally and entirely with you? I want to hear it. The whole story.
