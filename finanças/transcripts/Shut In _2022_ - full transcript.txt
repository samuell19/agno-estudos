You are a lovely little monkey. What's that? The rest of our food. We'll eat it during the trip. I got Animal Crackers in here. I don't wanna leave Nana's house. There's no jobs around here. And I don't have any money for Texas. Or anything else. I could sell apples for money. The apples are rotten, Lane. HOLY BIBLE Oh, shit! Lainey! Lainey, come here! Where are my apples, mommy? Lainey, listen… I need you to open the door. Okay? You just turn that little latch real hard. And it's rusted a little bit, so you need to use your muscles. Mommy, where are my apples? They're bad, Lane. Please, just open the door. Did you throw them outside? Baby, we can pick more apples, okay? But mommy needs your help. Can you help me? It's hard to turn, so make sure it's going the right way. Are the apples sick? They're bad, Lane. They're not worth saving. Okay. Stay in back! Fuck. Lainey? Lainey, are you there? Yes, mama. Unlock the front door and go to the red box on the porch. Open it up and bring me a long metal tool. One that has kind of a little X on the end. A tool? Yes. Just bring me what you can. The red box on the porch. Bring me anything from inside of it. - Okay, baby? - Okay. Here you go, mama. Good job. Now try to get one just like this but with an X, okay? Okay. Oh, God. Lainey? Did you find the tool? Someone's here. Who's here? Daddy, he took the red box. Is the front door locked like I told you? Daddy's leaving. Lainey, go outside and get him. Run. Got yourself locked in here again, Jess? Why I'm not surprised. Thanks. This is yours. Thanks. I'm just kidding. Calm down, Jess. Hey. You're hanging out with Sammy? I needed a place to stay. You could've stayed here if you'd passed the drug test, you know that. Hey, small fry, you're so biggie. How old are you? - Lainey. - I'm not a fry, I'm a girl. Lainey, come here. Come here, baby. Come on, let's go to the kitchen. Just go finish your sandwich, okay, baby? Hey, sweetie. You tracked dirt all over the floor, dammit. Sorry. Where's the little guy? He's upstairs taking a nap before the trip. I don't wanna wake him. So, Texas, huh? I can't afford to stay here. Can't afford it. Too expensive. Your grandma didn't leave anything? Like money. No. No, just the house. Look… You're both high. So you should go. Nah, I think this is good for us. I'm glad you asked me. This is our chance to talk. Talk about what? I figured out our problem, Jess. You think you're too good for me. No. No. I don't. I don't. I just got help. You can too, you know. We have kids. You brought Sammy here? You know what he did to that little girl. You're always paranoid about that stuff. It's called projection. What did I do, Jessica? Nothing, I was talking to Rob. What'd I do? Say it. I was talking to Rob, okay? I don't know. You said my name. Tell me what I did. Go ahead, tell me what I did. What'd I do? I wasn't talking to you, I was taking to Rob. Look… I've a lot to do, okay? Thank you for getting me out and I'll call you when we get there, okay? Oh, she's so busy, Rob. She's so busy. I think you've just been dismissed, buddy. I'm tired of getting dismissed by you, you know that? I mean. These are my kids, too. Yeah. You haven't changed. You're still weak and needy. What would've happened to you if I hadn't gotten you out of that pantry? Out here in the boondocks. Miles from the nearest neighbor? You're right. I'm sorry. She's lying. You're a liar. She's not sorry. She's a liar. Lying. Yeah, you just pretend I wasn't here, Jess. I'll tell you what you don't have to pretend. I'll put things back the way they were before I got here. Rob, stop!

I pushed the button on the door and sang ABC's to him until he fell asleep. You did a good job, Lane. Okay. Lainey, listen very carefully. I need you to go lock the front door. You already know how to unlock it. You just turn that little metal thing the other way. Okay. I turned the lock. You're a smart girl, Lane. Okay. Now. What did Daddy do to the door.

"The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing." "Watch out for false prophets." They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn-bushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. "Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them." HOLY BIBLE HOLY MATRIMONY BIRTHS JESSICA ROSE 9/25/1997 DEATHS Nana. APPLE BUTTER FOR JESSICA What good is this to me now? Sammy? You're alive, Sammy?
