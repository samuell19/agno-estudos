Arthur! What are you doing? Why do you spend the night here? Your cavalry's on the march an hour and you're asleep here? What cavalry? Your cavalry, commander. Don't you remember? Quick, my sword! - Where is it? - On the bed. - What bed? - I remember putting it there. Quick, get it! Where's this glove from? How should I know? What are you waiting? Run! I swear, Heinrich. I don't know where I am. In Fehrbellin, in the garden behind the castle. Once again I've gone out walking in the moonlight. There he is! He was drawn here by the moonlight while sleeping. He's asleep? Fast asleep. Call him and he'll fall to the ground. Stand back with the torch! I thought it was a fairy tale. Let's get closer. - This young man is ill. - He needs a doctor. We should help him. Don't worry, he's in perfect health. What is he fiddling with? Willow leaves? No, it's laurel. He could not have found them in the sands of the March. Don't laugh. Don't laugh! Natalia! My princess! My wife! Friedrich! My prince! My father! My mother! - Who's calling his mother? - He's truly mad. Natalia, why do you escape from me? Quick, Prince, let's help him forget all this. Go back to the void, Prince of Homburg. To the void, the void... We'll see each other on the battlefield tomorrow. Glory is not achieved in a dream... Excuse me, now I remember. It was so hot yesterday that I couldn't bear to stay in bed. What time is it? - Eleven thirty. - Have the squadrons already left? Of course, at ten. The Princess of Orange's regiment is in Hackelwitz to cover the advance against Wrangel. Doesn't matter. Kottwitz is in command, he knows the objectives. I would've had to return for the password anyway. Let's go. Does the Elector know anything? He's been sleeping for some time. What a strange dream I had! It was like a royal palace suddenly appeared before me glittering with gold and silver. The people I love most came down a marble staircase: the Prince Elector, the Electress, and then... There was... an other woman. Who? The one... who is on my mind. - Platen? - No, my friend. - Ramin? - No. Bork, Winterfeld? What did she look like? It's not important. In waking up I forgot, it's not important. The Prince Elector stood in front of me holding a laurel crown and to inflame me wrapped his own neck chain around it and then gave it to this person who put it on my head. He handed it... To whom? Answer. It must have been Platen. But she's in Prussia. - Or Ramin... - Ramin? With the red hair! Not her... If anyone, Platen, we know you like her. Yes, I like her. Well... you were saying it was she who offered you the crown? Like in an allegory of glory, she sought to crown a hero. She raises the crown with the chain dangling from it and very moved I reach out to try and grab it. I wanted to throw myself at that woman's feet! But like the mist lifts from the valley with a breath of wind, the group withdraws back up the stairs. I place my foot on the stairs and they stretch to infinity. I wave to try and get hold of their presence, but in vain, the door of the castle suddenly swings open and a flash of light from inside swallows them all up. The door then slams shut. While I followed them, I managed to remove a glove from that gentle dream creature. I found it in my hands when I woke up! And you think it belongs to her? To whom? To Platen? To Platen. - Maybe Ramin. - Maybe Ramin. It's midnight, do we want to sit around chatting all night? Is the Electress still here with her niece, the beautiful Princess d'Orange? Why? I was to have led an escort to take her from the war zone. I entrusted Ramin with the task. They'll have already left, or are about to leave. Ramin spent the night in readiness at the door. Now let's go. I want to rest a little before the battle begins. Let's go. What are these shots? Is it Goetz? Yes, he left yesterday with a division of vanguard. A Swedish contingent has reached the Hackel mountains. Goetz said to proceed as if his division has already beaten them. Gentlemen, the Field Marshall knows the battle plan. Write it down. Is Ramin ready? The plan devised by our Sovereign aims at the total dispersion of the Swedish army... Ramin will escort you to safety with thirty horsemen. You will go to the Havelberg Castle where there is no shadow of a Swede. Has the barge been repaired? Yes, everything is in order. It will be day before you arrive. Natalia... Why are you so silent? What is wrong? I'm afraid, dear Uncle. You are as safe as in your mother's womb. When will we see each other again? Should God lead me to victory, no doubt He will, in a few days. The Prince of Homburg... What is the Prince of Homburg doing? - Arthur! - Present. At your orders, Field Marshall. Where's your head? ...to whom His Highness once again assigns the command of the entire cavalry of the March, without the prejudice of Colonel Kottwitz, who will be his advisor. - Kottwitz is not here? - No, general. He sent me to take down the orders. - Is Ramin ready? - He's waiting by the gate. His Highness the Prince, according to the formal orders of our Sovereign... The glove... What is it, child? I don't know where I left my glove. ...whatever the outcome of this battle. no one is to abandon the position assigned to him. - What is the Prince doing? - At your command. Must not abandon the post assigned to him. - Is he speaking about me? - Certainly. - I must not abandon. - Certainly. ...until, followed by Hennings and by Truchss, the enemy's left wing overturned... Pages, light the way. ...and all divisions fall into disorder. In those marshes with numerous trenches the battle plan calls for their destruction. After which the trumpet will sound. The glove of Princess! - There, at the Prince's feet. - At my feet? Oh dear... Is it yours? Thank you, Prince. - Is it really yours? - Yes, I was looking for it. Farewell. I hope we see you soon and happy. After which the trumpet will sound! But His Highness the Prince Elector, to avoid the possibility that the trumpet is sounded too early... ...to avoid the possibility that the trumpet... ...is sounded too early... - Heinrich? - Yes. - What's going on? - Didn't you see anything? ...will bring you the order to attack the enemy. Before that moment you will not sound the trumpet. Are you with me? Before that moment he will not sound the trumpet. Have you written that? - Field Marshall... - I asked if you'd written it down. - About the trumpet? - What trumpet! Yes, not before... but then he will sound the trumpet. If it's possible, don't forget it, Baron Gotz. I would like to speak with Colonel Kottwitz. I will inform him, Sir. Have you made note of everything? We have finished. Your battle plan has been faithfully illustrated. Sir, Prince of Homburg... I recommend you keep calm. Recently you made me lose two victories on the banks of Rhine. Control yourself and make sure a third time will not happen today. Gentlemen, let's go. My white horse. I want to be on the battlefield before the sun rises. A beautiful day, that God created for other occupations more gentle than fighting. Have you seen how the cavalry's been deployed? I hope you will be satisfied with me. You know I approve everything you do. What orders did Doerfling give me yesterday? You were very distracted, I saw that. I felt bewitched. Don't know what it was, and writing on dictation confuses me. Truchss and Hennings and the infantry attack the enemy. You wait here with the cavalry, ready to attack when the order arrives. How strange... What, my friend? Wrangel is firing on Hennings. Look at the Swedish dispatches how they race right and left. Look, brothers! Wrangel's turning back! He's retreating. Follow me, Kottwitz! Calm down, boys. Sound the trumpet and follow me! Heavens, earth and hell, follow me! The Prince Elector commanded us to wait for his orders. - Gotz, read the instructions. - Wait for the order? - Hasn't your heart given it to you? - Why do you treat me like this? I'll tie that horse that brought you here to mine and drag you back! Trumpeter, sound the charge! Gentlemen we march! - Kottwitz will not stay behind! - Not this! - Hennings hasn't reached the Rhyn. - Take his sword away. Prince, your sword! - Insolent boy, here's your sword! - Prince what are you doing? Guards, take him away, he's under arrest! Now the orders are: he who doesn't follow his general is a traitor! - Who isn't with me? - Why are you so upset? The responsibility is yours and I am with you. Of course, the responsibility is mine. Follow me, brothers! The Elector has fallen! The Elector is dead! So it's true? Who will protect us from this world of enemies? If this wasn't an hour consecrated to mourning, I would tell you... Will I be lucky enough to grow in the heart of your hearts? What? - Let's go. - No, wait. In the depths of my heart! In the heart of my hearts. Prince... The Elector is alive, Count Sparren just told us. Quick, bring him here to me. Count Sparren... is it true you saw His Highness unhurt at Hackelwitz with Truchss' men? Yes, in the church courtyard. He was giving orders to bury the dead of both armies. But I saw him fall with his white horse, hit by cannon fire. Yes, but the man in the saddle was not our sovereign. But where's the Elector? He's in Fehrbellin, all generals are to join him. There's a truce, the Swedish Count Horn's here, we may have peace. - What a splendid ending! - Quick, let's follow him. Whoever commanded the cavalry and attacked on his own initiative before I gave the order, before Colonel Hennings could destroy the enemy bridges deserves to die and I submit him to court martial. Wasn't... the Prince of Homburg the commander? No, sir. Sire, the trophies won from the enemy. The Prince fell from his horse before the battle. He was seen inside a church being bandaged, he was gravely wounded. Good. In any case, today's was a splendid victory, but even if it had been ten times greater this would not justify the man who offered it to me. There will be other battles and we must obey the law. Whoever gave that order, I repeat, will pay, I will bring him before a military court. Prince, from where did you come? From the battlefield, my lord. They told me you were wounded and seriously. My sorrel fell before the battle. I can't really claim that this hand is wounded. Thus it was you who commanded the cavalry? Certainly. The proof is at your feet. Remove his sword. He is under arrest. Allow me a word, Prince. All flags are to be hung from the church tomorrow for the celebration of victory Prince, please, give me your sword. Arthur, keep your calm. Am I dreaming or am I awake? - Am I alive or gone mad? - Please, give up your sword. Am I under arrest? Yes, unfortunately. - You heard him. - And may I know why? You entered the battle too soon, you didn't wait for the order to attack. Help me, friends. I must have gone mad. - Was the March beaten? - Doesn't count, you must obey! I understand. Take him to headquarters and summon the military court. Heinrich... My friend Heinrich... Well, my arrest is over? You're free? - Did he send back your sword? - To me? No. Then why did you say "my arrest is over"? I thought you'd come to tell me. I don't know anything. It doesn't matter. He'll send someone else to tell me. Sit down. Has the Elector returned from Berlin? Yesterday evening. - Did they celebrate the victory? - Yes. The Princess and Natalia were also in the church. By order of the prince you were proclaimed victor. They told me. Your luck has changed in such a strange way. What do you think? What you and Golz and the judges think. The Elector has done his duty, now he will listen to his heart. He'll tell me: "You made a mistake..." Maybe he will even mention death and prison. "But I set you free..." If not, I never deserved it anyway. Arthur. Tell me. Are you really so certain? He's very fond of me, like a son. He's shown it to me in a thousand ways, always... What makes you doubt it? Hasn't he always enjoyed watching my fame grow? And don't I owe everything I am to him? And you think that forgetting that love now... You have been tried by a court martial... and you're still so confident? - For that very reason. One doesn't go this far unless he wants to forgive. I regained my confidence in front of that court! Do you think it is a crime worth death to have destroyed the Swedes two minutes before ordered to? It seems a verdict has been reached. Yes, I heard. The death sentence. You already knew? Golz told me, he was there for the reading. And it leaves you cold? Completely. Then you're mad. What do you base your confidence on? On what I feel for him. Don't insist, why should I torment myself with unfounded doubts? The court had to sentence me to death, it's the law. But the Prince, before allowing that this heart be... - Arthur, I assure you... - Stop it! Please... Just two more words, then I will be quiet. I already know everything. Alright, speak. The Marshall gave him the news of the death sentence at the castle. And instead of granting you a pardon as he could have, he asked for the document to sign it. - It's not important. - Not important? To sign it? I swear to my honor. The sentence or trial record? The death sentence. Who told you this? The Marshall himself, a moment ago. - After speaking with our sovereign? - Just after. Seeing me speechless, he added that not all was lost, that the sentence could be modified even tomorrow but... he didn't believe it either. He admitted "But I'm afraid..." He cannot hold to such a horrendous decision. He can't kill the man who gave him a diamond only slightly flawed! - You must believe it. - The Field Marshal remained silent? What could he say? Have you ever done, consciously or not, anything to hurt his pride? - Never! - Try to remember. - For me even his shadow was sacred. - Don't get angry if I doubt it. Count Horn arrived, the envoy from the King of Sweden. They say that he seeks the hand of Princess Natalia. But something the Electress said appears to have hurt our sovereign greatly. They say that Natalia has already made her choice. Are you involved in any way? - What do you think? - Are you? Well, Arthur? Now it is all clear. This marriage request is my downfall. It's my fault if Natalia refused. The Princess is engaged to me. Help me, my friend, I'm lost. You could talk to the Electress. Guard! Guard! If you can make this move well, you're saved. - Yes, Sir. - Call the officer. Franz! Will you allow me out for an hour? Prince, I'm not your keeper. My orders are to let you go wherever you want. That's better. - Am I not a prisoner? - Even your word is a chain. The chain follows him step by step. Mother! You're under arrest and come here? Why add to your guilt? Do you know what happened? I know everything but what can I do for you aside from suffering? You would not speak like this if you felt the shiver of death. I am alone on the face of this earth. Unarmed. Abandoned, incapable of reacting. You lost your head. Why? What's happened to you? On my way here to you I saw them digging my grave. They want to bury these eyes that look at you now and riddle this chest with bullets. The windows on the square have already been booked to watch this macabre spectacle. The man... who today looks at his future as if it were a fairytale kingdom tomorrow will begin to decompose inside a narrow grave and his tombstone will read "He was". My son, if this is God's will, you must have courage and dignity. But this world is so beautiful! Do not send me into the shadows before my time comes! He can punish me another way, why must it be by firing squad? He can strip me of my command, expel me from the army. Since the moment I saw my grave I want nothing else but to live, I don't care if it's undignified! Have you gone mad? I renounce all happiness. As for Natalia, tell her, I no longer desire her. Everything I felt for her is gone as if I never existed. She can give her hand, word, to anyone, even the King of Sweden. Yes, yes... Go now... Go back to your prison. If you want my favor, this is the first thing I ask you to do. You weep, poor child, for the death of your hopes. I look at you now and I know you will never belong to another. But in my disgrace what can I do to console you? Go, young hero, return to your jail, and look again, without dismay, at the grave they have dug you. It is no less dark than that every battle has prepared you for. I, true to you until death, will say to my uncle those words which may save you. Now go, the propitious moment passes all too quickly! Maybe I can touch his heart. Natalia... - Let me be. - What is it, dear? I beg you on my knees to pardon my cousin Homburg. I do not ask his life for me. My heart desires it, I do confess, but I do not ask his pardon for me. I want him to live for himself, free, serene, like a flower I like... I know you will grant my wish. You know the crime he's committed? Was it nothing? Did he not break the law because of his enthusiasm for your glory? History doesn't want you to crown him because he won and the cut off his head. It would be so sublime, dear Uncle, that appears almost inhuman. No one is more human than you. My child... were I a tyrant, my heart, would already have melted. But tell me yourself can I annul a sentence passed by the court? What would the consequences be? - For you? - What do you mean "for me"? Have you not heard of that sacred thing called the fatherland? It will not crumble if your heart has pardoned him. In fact, that which you, educated in the military, call disorder, the will to annul the sentence to me seems like order in its most precious state! I know... martial law must command. But even gentle feelings must command. The fatherland does not need this macabre sacrifice, the blood of a friend, to survive the splendid autumn of my Uncle. Does your cousin also thinks this? That for the fatherland the law and will are the same thing? Poor young man... What's happened? He only thinks of saving himself. So terrified of the rifle barrels pointing at him, that he is stunned and delirious, he has no other wish than that to live. He could watch the Kingdom of March collapse and not even ask what is going on. That's not possible! Does he beg for a pardon? If you had not condemned him! Is he asking to be pardoned? Why do you cry? Have you spoken to him? Yes, a short while ago, in my aunt's apartment. He was distressed, frightened, he moved like a thief without dignity! A miserable spectacle! I'd never have believed that a man considered a hero could fall so low! Look... I am a woman. and an innocuous worm that touches my foot scares me. By even if death were to confront me with the face of a lion I could not lower myself to this point If this is the case, take heart. your cousin is free. What do you say? He's pardoned. - Your pardon him? He won't die? - No, I swear. I respect his sentiments. If he thinks the sentence is unjust I cancel it and set him free. Heart, why do you beat so fast? Is the Prince still in the castle? No, he returned to prison. Do you want to deliver it yourself? Get a carriage immediately because the Princess must go to Colonel Homburg. This way he can thank you for saving his life. Well, my little one... are we friend again? I'm not interested to know what made you decide for clemency, but I feel certain that you are not fooling me and I thank you. Leave us alone. What news do you bring? Good, very good. You're pardoned, free. Read the letter. 'My Prince of Homburg... when I had you arrested I thought I was only doing my duty. I even counted on your approval. If you feel you have been done an injustice, then write me and I will send you back your sword." What did I tell you? You just have to write. Take the pen. Take it and write. Is this his signature? Yes, it's his seal. It says if I think... Yes, of course. Quick, sit down. I'll dictate. - I want to re-read it. - What for? Have you not seen the grave ready to swallow you? There's no time to lose. Sit down and write. Think of that grave as a partner... Write it or I'll get cross. Franz! Bring me paper, pen, sealing wax and my seal! Stupid beginning... Why? It was fine/ The style of a charlatan, not of a Prince. I must say it in another way. - What did he say in his letter? - Nothing. - Give it here. - Haven't you read it? I only want to see how I should express myself. Look.... You may have missed the point. Which one? He entrusts me with the decision. So what? Very good... A big heart. His generosity is boundless. Now do your part and write what he wants you to. It's only a pretext, two words and it's done. I want to think until tomorrow. But why? You haven't considered the meaning of the letter. I cannot write that I have suffered an injustice on his part. If you force me to say what I feel at this moment, I must say he treated me fairly. You're totally mad! What are you saying? Give me a moment and I'll know how to reply. Homburg... Tell me... My dear friend... I admire your heart's reaction, but the regiment that will celebrate the reconciliation at your tomb has been chosen. If you do not oppose the court's sentence and do what the Elector is asking you to do then he will reply to you in an equally sublime way and, with even great compassion, he will allow the execution! It's not important. He acts as he wants, I must act as I must. What are you writing? Take this letter to my sovereign. I cannot respond in an ignoble way to the man who's been noble with me. The mistake was mine. Even if right now you were to go before a firing squad, and there were nothing I could do, I could shout with joy, cry and say "That is how I like you". But if you follow your heart, then I must follow mine. Count Reuss! Take this letter to Colonel Kottwitz. Immediate departure, orders from the commander. I expect him here before midnight. Highness, a rebellion. Slowly, slowly... You know I cannot bear people entering unannounced... Forgive me, but there's a reason. Kottwitz, acting without orders, is here with 100 officers. - Because of the Prince of Homburg? - Yes. Those madmen want to hand you their petition. If you confirm his sentence, they will use force to free him. If you intend to pardon, the Prince, then do so. All armies love their hero. Colonels Kottwitz, Hohenzollern and others request an audience. Is this from the Prince of Homburg? Yes, Your Highness. Prittwitz, bring me the death sentence and the passport for the Swedish minister, Count Gustav Horn. Kottwitz and the others... Send them in. Allow me to present you this on behalf of the whole army. Kottwitz, who called you to the city? I ordered you to stay in Arnstein. Your orders called me here. What? Let me see. Here, Sir. "Natalia, from Fehrbellin... On behalf of my august Uncle Friedrich." Who brought it to you? - Count Reuss. - Good. Tomorrow you and your squadrons will pay the last honors to the Prince of Homburg after his execution. - What, Your Highness? What news do you bring me? It's a petition from your loyal army but what you have just said annuls all hope. "Petition to Your Royal Highness to pardon our commander, Colonel prince Arthur Friedrich of Axel-Homburg..." - Does the Prince know this? - Not at all. Strange! An old soldier like you defending the actions of the Prince? You justify his attacking Wrangel, disobeying my orders? Yes. I want the Prince of Homburg here. He will teach you what military discipline and obedience are. My dear Prince, I called you here for some help. Colonel Kottwitz has presented me with a paper in your favor signed by over 100 officers. The army asks for your release and disapproves of the sentence. Please, read it yourself. I accept the sentence. - Prince, are you mad? - Prince Elector, listen to us. With my freely accepted death, I want to celebrate the sacred law of war which I violated. Forgive me if I served you with too much haste. Death will absolve me of all guilt. Give this heart which submits to your sentence with serenity the proof that you too will renounce all rancor. And in this hour of farewell, to comfort me, grant me one favor. Speak, my young hero. Whatever you ask is already yours. Do not buy peace from King Gustav Karl with the hand of your niece. Squash whoever made you such a cruel proposal. I will do as you said. I will write that Natalia is the bride of the Prince of Homburg, executed according to the law. The King of Sweden will have to win her from his spirit in battle where he marches dead in front of all the flags. You have now given me back life. Bring him back to prison. My dear, unhappy friend! - Go! - Prince, never! - Where are you going? - I've finished with this world. May we go now, Your Highness? Not yet. I will tell you when you can fall out. This passport must be given to Count Horn. This is the promise I made to the Prince. In three days the war resumes. Gentlemen, judge for yourselves. Last year, because of superficiality the Prince of Homburg deprived me of two wonderful victories. He seriously compromised even the third. Would you want to risk a fourth with him? Would you? Would you?! Now, immortality, you're all mine! Through this cloth you blind me with the light of a thousand suns. My wings grow and my spirit is freed in the silence of the heavens. Like a ship which sees its port disappear, I'll see all forms of life fade from me. For a second more I will distinguish colors and shapes, then all will become haze... the world evaporates... What a sweet scent the violets give off at night! They are stocks and carnations. Stocks, here? Some girl planted them. Can I offer you a carnation? My dear friend... I want to put it in water when I get home. What light is this? Prince, you can stand up. What is it? Nothing to be frightened of. I want to take off the blindfold. In this last moment of my suffering? The joy kills him. Wake him with the cannon! Long live the Prince of Homburg! Long live the hero of the battle of Fehrbellin! But tell me... Is this a dream? A dream, of course, what else?
