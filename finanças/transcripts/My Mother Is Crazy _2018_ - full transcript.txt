We all have a mother. We might love her too much or not enough. Often, she smothers us, but we couldn't breathe without her. She makes us laugh, she makes us embarrassed, she can even make us cry. We all have a mother, but you haven't met mine. -Ms. Nina Weber? -Yes? Mr. Janvier, bailiff. This is my son, he's on a work placement. May we? Yes. What's this about? Didn't you receive a notice? -No. -You've defaulted on your payments. I'm sorry, I have to take an inventory. May I? Yes. So... you borrowed... 800,000 euros, in a mortgage on your home. Oh dear, it's in fine. In fine, that means it finishes eventually, right? Absolutely. If you don't pay it back in a year, they'll take your house. But it's worth far more than that, look! I believe you, but a loan must be paid. -I've been paying it for years. -You've only been paying interest. It's a terrible system. I shouldn't be telling you this, but they want to build apartments. They can't tear it down! The house should be protected. -It was my grandfather's. -I understand. Meanwhile, you have one month to pay off your debt, which is 47,814 euros. How much? Forty-seven eight thousand and fourteen euros. No, wait... I'll renegotiate! The bank doesn't know, I've started a jewelry line! Here, look. I make them from shells and beads. You want to try it on? It's unisex. It suits you. Do you like music? I produced an album. I met this singer on the subway. Do you like it? -What language is that? -Bosnian! -No-one will understand it. -It's rap! You think people understand rap? You're lucky to have a son. -I lost mine... -I'm sorry. Oh no, he's not dead, we just don't talk anymore. His name's Baptiste. Pig-headed, just like his father. Are you alright? I'm sorry. I'm used to it. It's always a shock when we come to visit. Get a glass of water. You feel like a bird on a twig, right? And one day, the twig breaks. I work hard, every day. Music, jewelry, I have a lot of projects, but sometimes I feel like a chicken without a head, still running around. Do you ever feel like that? Emir? It's Nina. We've got a meeting with the head of Sony. No, you have to come with me. Where are you? The squat? Where's that? I'm on my way. Crazy woman! MY CRAZY MOTHER A FILM BY DIANE KURYS -Nina! -Ah, Emir! What's going on? I'm being deported. I have to go back to Bosnia for two weeks before I can apply for a new residence permit. I got us a meeting with the head of Sony, but if you're not there, there's no point. Is this your son? No. He was on the streets, I took him in. Where's he from? -What's his name? -I don't know. What's your name? He only says "no". No. That's awful. Do you know how many kids like him are in Paris? You're sick of this life, no? I'll be straight with you: I'm broke, they're taking my house. I didn't think you were poor. Neither did I. At least... Not this poor. I don't even have life insurance. My life isn't good enough to be insured. I've always been like the grasshopper. The Ant and the Grasshopper. The grasshopper! The grasshopper... The insect. This is good stuff. That's what you have to do... -What? -Sell. -Do I look like a dealer? -No, and that's why. You can just speed by the police. You're asking me to make a drug run? Yes! Who's going to stop a beautiful woman in a car? Do you have a car? You can get one. You just need a little money to buy some stock. How much do I need to buy it, to earn like 50, 100,000? You can start with 10,000, 20,000? You're right, they would never suspect me. I have contacts in Rotterdam. -Rotterdam, really? -You know it? No, no. Vladimir. Tell him I sent you. I'll warn him. But if you have to go home, what are you going to do with him? Everything alright? Everything alright? CANNABIS RAID A little afternoon white. Here. Thanks. It'll be good for us. He doesn't talk at all? Sometimes he says "no". Ah. But isn't that... -Baptiste's jacket? -Yes. Why didn't you take him...? -To who? -To the police! That's the last thing he needs. Don't touch now! -He won't steal anything, right? -Hey, come on. Here. -What's this? -Open it. You didn't! Your Boghossians... You've always liked them. -Do you still like them? -Oh yes, I love them! I'll try them on. Oh, they're beautiful! Like stalactites. How much do you want? -Twenty thousand. -Twenty? I think I have that. Hey, Chiquito! Don't touch anything! Niet! No se toca. No, niet! Well... Here we are! -You keep that around? -Ten and 20. Yes, I have a safe, but I forget the code. So I put it all around, in the drawers. Thank you. You don't know what happened on Saturday, it was funny. I wanted to post a sort of literary tweet. I reached for Alfred de Musset, and what was inside? Ten five hundred dollar bills. I had completely forgotten about them. It's Xavier. We're off to the philharmonic. You know what? Finish your wine, and close the door on your way out. Hey, Jess, could I borrow your car? Yes. It's brand new. -Is it an automatic? -I don't know, the driver bought it. I know nothing about cars, but my keys are there, it's in the garage, the garage is open, and the papers are in the glovebox. -Thank you, my dear. -Bye! I have to give you a name! -A name? -No. Yes! A name! "No, no, no, no", always "no"... No, no... Hey, "Nono"? How's that? Nina and Nono, sounds funny, right? This is more than a journey, Nono. We've chosen a dangerous road. I'm already tired. I'm warning you, I like to talk. Even if you don't understand, I'll talk. Do you know I have a son? When he was eight or nine, like you, we went on a trip together. We called it our "Tour de France". We didn't know where we were going. It was summer. At some point, he asked me to tell him my life story. So, I told him. I think that's when we really got to know each other. How are you? Good, good. -What are you doing here? -Business trip. I thought I'd come and see you. Can I come in? Of course. No, no, wait. Nono, this is Baptiste. -Who's this? -I call him Nono. I don't know his real name. It's crazy how I've never been here. Oh Babou, you're all grown up. How long has it been? Two years. Two years. -You're not sick, are you? -No, why? -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure! You don't seem happy to see me. I am, I'm happy. Can you drink the tap water here? Yeah. I have to tell you, I have a girlfriend. A girlfriend? Great! Here, Nono. What's her name? Elke. Elke! Her name is Elke! Don't start, Mom. Be cool with her, the Dutch are very family-oriented. Unlike me, you mean. Looks like you've got a family now. You know, if each of us took in an immigrant... In France, there's what, 60 million people? -Are those my Converse? -Yes. I kept everything. Whose kid is he? You can speak up, he doesn't understand. He's no-one's, he was abandoned, so I took him in. -Officially? -No, not at all. Wait... That's totally illegal, there are rules... -Oh, you've always been like this... -You can't just do what you like! Always sticking to the rules! Do you want to stay over? Just one night. Is that OK? I'm so happy I'm here! So, tell me... -Are you happy? -Very. I'm at the European Commission, so I go to Brussels twice a month. -You're still an architect? -Yes. What's this? A model. Social housing, made of cardboard. Cardboard, that's amazing. I love it, it's great. Hello. This is my mother. Huh? -Elke. -Guten Tag, Elke ! Bonjour. You didn't tell me she was so pretty! A Northern beauty! -Like a Viking! -Mom... You are gorgeous. Magnifique Mädchen! Stop speaking German to her! She's not German! Who's that? That's Nono, he's a little Kurdish boy, or Syrian, we don't really know. Come and say hello, Nono. "Hello". He's not very good at speaking. He's adorable, isn't he? It's so nice to meet you. I was just going to make dinner, could someone help me? If I ate like that, I'd get no dessert. Yes, I always took away your dessert. Have you noticed, he only uses his right hand. He does everything else with the other one. They invented hygiene as well, not just mathematics. You enjoy food more that way. You feel it, then taste it. We haven't had rice in a long time, have we? We normally eat fruits and vegetables, raw. The "raw foods" diet. It's good for you. I'm sure it is, but isn't that a lot of fiber? -Fiber? -Fiber for... Toilettenproblem! That's enough, Mom. Calm down, Babou! My son is a little stiff. And what do you do, Elke? I'm a graphic designer. And you? Baptiste never told me. What is your job? I do a lot of things. I started young, I had to eat! First, I was a dancer. Three years. -Three years? -Yes. In the opera house. But it was too hard. So, I became an actress -and a singer. -Oh! Then, I married Baptiste's father. He was a doctor, so I had to do dinners, trips. Then, I went into music, some cinema, some musicals... I produced a film and an album. Now, I'm concentrating on my jewelry line. Oh, wait! This one is for you, Elke. -With your lovely blue eyes. -Dankuwel! Baptiste! Come here! -It's lovely! -And this one, this is for you, Babou. Try it on. Is it too feminine? It's very cool! How long have you had this hobby? Oh, it's not a hobby! It's why I came here. I came for the pearl showroom! -Pearl showroom? -Yeah! In Zandvoort. The most famous one in Europe. Don't you know? It's very famous. Calm down, my mother annoys me too. We've all got a mother. Yes, but you don't know mine. I do now. No, you don't. She's a liar. Have you heard of a pearl showroom in Zandvoort? There's only racetracks! I don't know why she's here. Maybe she just wanted to see you but didn't want to say it. No. I don't think you understand her. In two years, she's never come here once. Maybe she's changed. You saw her with the boy, she's nice to him. That's true... Can't she stay until Sunday? -No. -She's your mother! Family is important. I'd like her to meet my parents. -Have you told her? -What? -That we're getting married. -Not yet. She hates everything to do with family and marriage. Hello? Hello, Nina? Hello, Jess. Can you hear me? I hear you. So, how's it going? Awful, it's like I'm a stranger. He's changed. It's the North. The cold has made him mean. No, don't say that. You know he loves you. You were inseparable when he was little. Inseparable! -You wouldn't know him anymore. -I do know him! We talk a lot. I'm his godmother after all. He's like a son to me! You don't know him anymore. What's going on? Nothing, I'm just tidying my books. I'll call you back tomorrow, dear. How are you, Babou? -I hope I didn't wake you. -You did. I can't function without my daily routine. Gently... Can you press down on my back? No, come on, I'm having my coffee. Go on, Babou, with your little masseuse hands. Do you know yoga? It's from where you're from. -He's not Indian. -How do you know? What's that? What? -A bat? -You're kidding, right? It's the Sydney Opera House. Did you design that? -You're making fun of me. -You could have! You should have! I have to go! Where's your girlfriend? She went out. Without waking me. I can't be late. These big events can be crazy... And I have to buy so much. Without pearls, I can't make bracelets, without bracelets, I can't buy food, without food, no more Mommy. I hope they're not too expensive. You never know with showrooms. Well, if they don't agree with my prices, I'll buy nothing! OK, I'm going. See you later, Babouch. Don't go anywhere, I don't have a key. Together again. -You be good now. -No, Nono, he can't stay. I've got to work. Of course, you're right. I'll take him with me, he'll enjoy it. Come on, Nono! What the fuck is she doing? What the hell is this? Fuck... -Hello? -Mom, what are you doing? I'm here at this building. Speak up, I can't hear you... -Mom, can you hear me? -No, I'm not here! But leave me a message and listen to this lovely beep! You watch too much TV. Don't hold on to me, you know how to walk! -No. -Just walk. Get in. Babou, what are you doing here? No, what are you doing here? What? Can't I be a tourist? Tourist? Have you seen where we are? You're going to feel so stupid, Baptiste, so very stupid. Do you know who lived in that house? Anne Frank. That's where she was taken from. Are you serious? Anne Frank was in Amsterdam. The real house was here! The Germans destroyed everything! Why the face? Do you want to ask Google? Stop it. The Germans were everywhere, looking for Jews, and you're accusing me before this sacred place. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, same thing! -Give me the key. -She wrote her book in the attic! Or in the basement, sometimes they hid in the basement, like rats. -Give me the key. -And poor Anne, and Mr. and Mrs. Frank, who are too often forgotten... Mr. and Mrs. Frank... Do you think I'm stupid? You come in with your sunglasses and necklaces! You came here for pearls? To Anne Frank's pearl store? No! Baptiste, I forbid it! No way, you didn't. -Close the door. -You didn't. Close the door, Baptiste. I'll explain. Hurry! No. I'm going to tell them what you've bought. That my mother has gone mad. They have mothers, they'll understand! We shouldn't stay here! French. Go get your bike, Babouch! Hey, it's fine... Everyone smokes nowadays, and they did before too. I can't. You're crazy! Don't tell your mother she's crazy! Do you realize what you have in your car? I don't even know how you got the car. I don't want to know. It's nice, huh? I borrowed it. I really don't want to know. He's mad! Did you see that? He was the same when he was young. Bad nature, the opposite of you. He started talking very early. You're not deaf, are you? OK, you're not deaf. -What happened? -Nothing. I don't want to see her. I'm putting her things outside. If she rings, don't open the door. Do you want to tell me what happened? We had a fight. -Because of me? -No, not because of you. I know this might seem harsh, but if you knew why she was here... Why is she here? Nothing... She came with that kid, she doesn't even know where he's from. Can you pass me his bag? She's downstairs. Baptiste, I'm not a dealer. I've done nothing illegal since '95. If I had the money, I would pay my taxes. It's just... I'm not doing it for me. It's for someone who is very sick. It's for Jess. Is she sick? I'm her only support, and it's expensive, this operation is her last chance. So you can say your mother is crazy, but at least she has a heart. But she didn't say anything. I spoke to her on the phone a month ago. What is it? Is it serious? She's going blind. Jess? Blind? How? I don't know. Like Ray Charles. The glasses, the cane... It's a disease. But what disease? How do I know? I'm not a doctor. -And her husband? -Xavier? He ran off with a 6-foot Russian woman. When she looks down at him, she just sees his bald head. Bastard, threw her away like an old boot, penniless, like your father did to me. You'll see, poor thing, banging into everything. And she's put on weight. It can't be true. You don't believe me? I do, I do, but it's awful. She could have asked someone else. But she asked me. Why didn't you ask someone else? Who? Dad. Don't call him "dad" in front of me! But he could have helped you. Never. I don't want his money. I have my principles. Didn't you spend three years on food stamps? Never! You have to be generous, Baptiste. I always have been. I've never been good with numbers. I don't know if I could do this. Even for someone very close. I think it's crazy, the risks you're taking. Risks... That's a big term for it. It is drug trafficking. Trafficking... You imagine me in prison already? I'm coming with you. No, absolutely not. I can't leave you, Mom. I never could... Never? You did alright on your twentieth birthday! You blew out your candles and left. Can you imagine, a mother, dipping her cheese and toast into her morning coffee, alone? I had no choice... Don't come back after five years saying you'll help me. Go home, go back to Ikea. I'll be fine. I don't need you, thank you. You know we can't go on like this. That's not true. We were a good team, the two of us. Tomorrow morning, we'll leave together. No. Mom, do you know what you've gotten yourself into? Seriously? You want to go on a road trip? Like Thelma and Louise? Yeah, well... Bless you! Whose cat is that? It's to throw off the dogs at the border. -I saw it in a film. -Where did it come from? Your building. It got into the car by itself. Mom, it's wearing a collar. A collar? Oh, I didn't see that. That means it belongs to someone. You don't like cats? I like cats, but I'm allergic. Oh yeah, shit, I forgot. So, what's your plan? You're not going to sell the weed yourself, are you? Yeah, from a stall at the farmer's market. "Who will buy my weed?" Hidden in plain sight, right? OK, you have no plan, but how much did you buy? Two kilos. Shit. Of course, I have a plan! You're surprised, aren't you? It was... I don't know what year... We were in Martinique, Club Med, with your father. He had to go home, some emergency, and I stayed. You lose yourself in those islands. The sun, the rum... And back then, sex was still... Well, that's where I met Alvaro. I know you're wondering. -No, no. -Yes, Baptiste. We made love. One night, we were on the beach... The next day, I had sand everywhere, I can't even tell you! Yet you are telling me. He taught me the tango. His father was Argentinian. He had a friend named Guillermo. I also got to know him quite well. We were a great trio. The things we got up to! -Why are you telling me this? -I stayed in touch with Alvaro. He lives in Brussels now, and I think he can help us. Oh yeah? How? I think he hangs around with druggies and whores. OK. So, wait... If I understand this right, we're going to see a drug trafficker who you slept with on a beach in-- Yes, alright, fine. And you're going to say to him: "Hi. I have two kilos of weed. -"Can you help me?" -Exactly. Isn't he handsome? And he's kind. We'll have to get it some food and let it out, to do its business. I don't think the cat was a good idea. Really? No, not your allergies, I've got a bad feeling. -About the cat? -I think it can understand us. I've been watching what I say. Okay. Cats are reincarnations. How many civilizations worshipped dogs? You're totally nuts, you know that? Don't tell your mother she's nuts! I never said she was ugly. I said she was stern. You're so delicate, it's like a strudel and a pretzel, don't you think? Can we not talk about this? You're allowed to like curves. You wouldn't be the first. But she is... she's stocky. And her face is a little... What? We're allowed to talk about it. No, we're not. I think she's beautiful. And didn't you tell her she was beautiful? I wasn't going to tell her she was ugly, I'm polite. What are you doing? Put that out, Mom. What? Oh, we'll explode, is that it? I know what the problem is. You haven't slept with a lot of girls. So, you latch onto the first blonde who's nice to you. You know, in a seaside resort, it takes just one ray of sunshine to feel like the Maldives. -Where are you going? -To pay. Oh look, he's used a shoelace! Well done, Nono. Give me that. And the cat... Speaking of which, I'll be right back. Here. -I needed that! -Are you doing this on purpose? -What? -What do you mean, "what"? -Goddammit, Mom! -Why are you mad? You don't know what the ladies' is like. Why do you embarrass me every chance you get? You think: "If I can annoy my son, I will." What do you mean? Every day it's been like this, Mom. "I'm going to wear my see-through dress "to the PTA meeting." "I'll give tango lessons at home, while Baptiste is studying." Come on, no-one saw me. You're stressing me out. -Did the cat go? -No. Take it to the bathroom! The ladies'! I think it's a girl! Are you going to sulk forever? A little pee, and I'm excommunicated. I thought you'd changed your opinion, realized I wasn't so selfish. I never said you were selfish. Then why are you always judging me, -criticizing me? -I'm here, aren't I? I'm here with you. And I'm proud that you're doing something good for someone. It's kind. JESS IS CALLING -Aren't you going to answer it? -No. But what if something's happened...? Shit! No! Hello, Nina? Nina, it's me! Jess? Listen, this isn't a good time. Can I call you back? No, no, I'm headed to the airport. Would you believe it, Xavier surprised me. He's taking me skiing! You know how much I love skiing! And he wants to buy me a chalet! It's my dream, a little wood cabin in the snow. Jess, is it a good idea to go skiing in your condition? What do you mean, my "condition"? I'll be fine. You know I love skiing. Listen, I'm calling about my car. I'm worried, I don't want it to come back in pieces! I know you. So, Baptiste? Tell me about his Dutch heifer, what's she like? Your message made me laugh. That's enough, stop! Nina? I know what you're going to say... Don't. It's not what you think. -Jess has lost her mind-- -Don't talk to me. Drop me at the station. How could I think you'd changed? I've been an idiot, as usual. Because I want to protect you, because I'm all you have. I have a girlfriend, friends, a life without you, And you come in with your orphaned boy, to buy drugs! And I'm a scared ten-year-old again. Scared because you're too crazy to be left alone. Because that's the truth, you're crazy! You're not right in the head! Stop, please. And "Dutch heifer"? What fucking disrespect! Have you seen how pathetic you are? Always the same stories, free love, love is everything, but love of what? You've never loved anyone! No-one! And now look at you. You're alone, repeating the same old stories, boring everyone with your failure of a life! Please... You disgust me. -That's enough, Baptiste. -Drop me at the station. Or right here. I said here! Stop the car! We've never understood each other. It's like we don't speak the same language. You don't speak, but you understand. What will I do now? Can we wait with you? Well, we're going to wait anyway. Do you remember... that summer in Brittany? We rented a house on the beach. You wore your yellow raincoat, your little galoshes. You ate ice cream, you fell in love with the girl next door. You don't remember? That's understandable. Sometimes... it's better to invent new memories. You're right, I'm a failure. I don't know why I've never had more ambition... I've never seen anything through. And what do you want me to say? I don't care. I screwed up my life, and I don't care. The only thing that hurts... is you turning your back on me. Not seeing that you were there... and that you won't always be there. And now you hate me so much... you can't even look me in the eye. Don't cry, Mom. I'm sad too. It's how it is. That's our story. I'm sorry. I love you, Babouch. You know, when Dad left, he forgot his toothbrush. And you left it there, next to yours for... over a year, I think. I remember, it was green. One day, I couldn't take it, I threw it in the trash. I didn't notice. You didn't notice anything, Mom. Whenever you had your fun... I had to deal with it. This café is depressing. Come on! Won't you dance? -Will you dance? -No, thank you. Will you dance? -I don't know how. -I'll teach you. It's easy, you'll see. -May I? -Of course! Hello? -Did I wake you? -No, no. How are you? No, I waited up for you all night. I'm sorry, something came up. What? Nothing, I'll explain later, everything's alright. Do you want to cancel Sunday? Tell me now, all my family is coming. No, don't cancel anything, I'll be home tonight. It's amazing, you know... It's like she's got a new lease of life with this kid. -Are you jealous? -No, I'm not jealous, but it's strange. I was around the same age when my father left. You never told me about that. What happened? He asked me to be good to her, stupid things. That's when I started getting up in the night to check on her. I tucked her in and watched her sleep. I never told her. So... See you tomorrow? See you tomorrow. I've been thinking about what you said. You're right, I didn't want to be your mother, I wanted to be your friend. I knew I was giving you a good life, but I wasn't really there. My heart wasn't in it. Do you think I'm heartless? Please, not in the morning. You know, everything I said about marriage... Don't listen to me. Do what you feel is right. I don't know what I'm saying. I love this one! Stop it! Stop! Are you OK? Yeah. Fortunately, you drive like an old lady. I didn't see it. Don't worry. I'll tell Alvaro, we can't be far. Hurry, what if someone calls the police? The police... I don't think this is someone's prize hog we've just hit. Ah, there's a car. -It's the police. -The police? Nono, hide, quickly, don't move! Hello! What did this poor creature do to you? I love Belgian humor! And the police! And Belgians! Ah yes, this poor beast who died senselessly... It's awful! -Hello, Officer. -Did you hit it? No, it wasn't me. -It just came out of nowhere. -Yeah? -It was crossing-- -Well, you didn't miss it! The wheel is shot. We'll get the spare. That's lovely of you, but we'll manage. We'll help, ma'am, that's what we're here for. Just between us, I don't think this lad will be much help. Help me move the animal. Who says we need help? Just because I'm a woman, I can't change a wheel? Yes, you can watch. That's your job! -It might not be dead. -"Might not be dead"? You a vet, are you? Oh, "women drivers", is that it? That's enough! Open the trunk. There you go! Happy? You're gonna break it! You just need one finger, not your whole hand! Give it mouth to mouth then. Karim! Take care of the lady, please! Ma'am, hands on the hood. There is no hood! -I said, hands on the hood! -She's right, Gilou, there's no hood. Fine, well... Hands on your head. Lie down there. Go on. You too! Hands on your head! Stay there. There! You happy? I make jewelry. What did you expect? A truckload of heroin? There's something here. More jewelry? The car's not mine, I borrowed it from a friend. What's this? Herbal tea. I put it there to keep it cool. It's limeflower. That's not tea. Smell that. Do you think that's tea? Yeah. What are they talking about? Yeah, it's tea. You've been duped. Know what I mean? You're not the first. Some people get given lawn grass. -Lawn grass? -Yeah, it's funny. Well, we're going to the station. -Why? -A statement, for the pig. It was alive before it met you. Stop laughing! Those guys... They ripped me off! Good thing they did, or you and I would be in jail. I'd be getting fucked in the shower because of my mother. Well, at least you can sell your herb at the farmer's market. It'll sell better than your necklaces. Seriously, what were you thinking? Are you that desperate for money? I'm in a little bit of debt. Really? How much? Fifty thousand. I'll be OK, don't worry. I'll find a solution. Stay down, you. I did what I could, but it won't last. -What do I owe you? -Two hundred and fifty, please. Hundred, 200, and 250. Thank you. -You're welcome. Sorry for my hands. -It's OK. Be careful, don't drive too far like that! Nono? Sir! Have you seen a little boy? -Have you lost a kid? -Yeah. I don't know, the police station is right there. We just came from there. Hey! What the hell? Nono, you scared me! He was hungry, that's his second cone. I thought he was alone. No, he's with us. Thank you. How long has it been since he ate? We picked him up, we don't know where he's from. He's Bosnian, like me. Look. That's his father, Emir Bracich. No way. His name is Mansour. Why didn't your father tell me? -What? -My rapper, it's his father, Emir. Fries are on me. -Thank you so much, sir. -Thank you. The nerve of that guy! He told me he was abandoned. I'm going to call him. -Two fries, two beers, please. -Two beers. Sounds weird. Hello? Hello, Emir? It's Nina. Why didn't you tell me? What do you mean? where are you? Singapore? He's working on a ship. When are you coming back? A world tour? No, no, I won't forgive you. I can forgive anything, except lying. Hello? It cut off. Don't look at me like that. It cut off. Did your father tell you not to speak? Yes. I'm not going back to him. He's crazy. And he's not even a good singer.q I don't know what I saw in him. Don't worry, Nono, your dad will come back. And I won't leave you. -It's Nina. -Come on in. Alvi! Darling! Nina! How lovely! I'm so happy to see you! You're still beautiful. And you still smell good. This is Baptiste. My son, not my boyfriend! -He's handsome! -Isn't he? And this is Nono. Or Mansour, we're not sure. Hello, Mansour. Give me some, hey! Right on! -Have you seen the car? -Yes. I think it needs a little work. You'll never guess what happened. -The police were involved. -Let's not talk about unhappy things! Hola! Welcome! Let me introduce Miguel. -Hello! -Hello. -I'll get my things. -Oh, I'll get them. Yes. Ask Albert to put the car in the garage. -Vale. -Come, come in. The door is by an Italian artist. Arnaldo Pomodoro. Weighs a ton. It's amazing. A great artist! Come with me. Oh, wow! Here we are! It's like Ali Baba's cave! This is your room. Would you like to put the boy next door? No, he'll sleep in here. Thank you. My pleasure. -I'll let you get settled. -Thank you. I'll show you your room. Will the animal sleep with you too? -Can you keep it? Please? -Yes, sure. After you. It's like a palace, huh? Look how lovely this is! It's amazing. So luxurious! It's like Bill Gates' house. More like Pedro Almodovar's. Don't you like it? I do like it. It's magnificent. It's just, your "ex", he's a little... What? A little what? Mafioso? Oh, definitely mafioso. But also a little queer, right? Alvaro? Gay? -Alvaro, not gay? -Definitely not. I know very well which team he bats for. -Mom... -What? You know, I made a film. Oh yeah? About what? Me. One day, this girl called me, I think she was a journalist. Can you believe that? May as well drive myself to prison. So, what did you do? Gave her 200,000 to leave it alone. I can't believe you're gay now. That's life. It happens. Baptiste was just saying that in his room. He said: "I think Alvaro is a queer." I didn't think so. I didn't say that. Yes, you did. You said it while you were showing me that funny shoe phone. I hope you like it. In Asturias, we call this "fabada". It's a traditional dish from the North of Spain. It's a casserole, pero español. Excuse me. I thought you'd become, I don't know, a guru in the Amazon with 12 wives. And here you are in Belgium, rich and gay! How did it happen? Thanks. -The money or the gay thing? -Both? Well, you had something to do with the gay thing. When you left, I was devastated. It was hard, very hard. Fortunately, there was... Guillermo. -What? You mean... -Guillermo, yes. We had a torrid relationship. It lasted ten years. It was magical. Guillermo... But then, he was taken. -AIDS? -No, a wave in Ibiza. That's awful. Poor Guillermo. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. -I know. It's awful, but it is what it is. It's been a long time. Let's not talk about it. Time goes on. Of course. And I've found love again. Right, Miguel? This smells delicious. The sausage looks especially good. Can't sleep? I was thirsty. Thanks. His fabada was disgusting. I can't say anything, he gets upset. -You're right, it was inedible. -Yeah. So, what happened? Tell me. -I'm a little bit... -Screwed? You could say that. I was conned. I bought two kilos of marijuana, they sold me tea. Don't laugh! I paid 20,000 for herbal tea. No way. So you need money? Yes, why else? I'm in a little debt. Well, a lot. I thought I'd sort it out, here I am. I love you. You're completely crazy, but... I love you. You're the most... fantastic woman I know. And you're beautiful as well. Sometimes I'm scared. That's new, you were never scared of anything. -He left two years ago. -Yeah. I can't seem to get by without him. But I can't live with him, with my son. I told you, we had an accident. But you'll be there on Sunday? I don't know. I'll be back as soon as I can. Ok, Baptiste, listen, I've thought about it. Let's find another date for the engagement, OK? We don't need to rush. -Why? -You've got enough going on. It's important that you two reconnect. Stay with her, as long as it takes. -And your parents? -Don't worry. They're cool, they'll understand. You know I love you? I love you too. I miss you. You know, if you hadn't switched teams, I'd have made love to you like in Buenos Aires. You remember the hotel de la Naranja? Remember the night we broke the bed... Oh, I remember. There was a banana tree on the patio. You remember? A banana tree on the patio, remember? Yes. What was his name? I don't know, but he looked like you. -Really? -Yeah. Somebody slept well! How are you, Nono? Do you want some orange juice? Look at me. My goodness! I'm crazy about your son! Look how handsome he is, he's making me crazy! He's great. Well? It'll be two days. -No... -Believe me, I tried. The parts have to come from Germany. Look what I've got for you. Let's go try it out. I have to get home! Are you not happy here? -Well? -Yes, we're very happy. I'm going to make dinner. Pasta carbonara. Sound good? It's my specialty. You'll see, you'll love it. I'll be in the kitchen. Join me if you wish. He won't stop flirting with me, he's driving me crazy! What do you want me to do? He thinks you're cute. You are cute. You know what? Tell him I'm his son. You're mad. What gave you that idea? When we first came here, I thought that was why you brought me. To meet my real dad. You wouldn't do that, right? Wait, why did you bring me? Tell me the truth. What truth? What do you want me to say? Is he my real father? That guy, Alvaro, is he my father? Oh fuck... No way, it is him. You know, he has a big heart. He's a good man, Alvaro. -He's very... -Fuck. No, he's not your father! Your father is your father. He's a moron, but... I wouldn't do that to you, with Alvaro. A shame, you'd be rich. You're ridiculous! You're ridiculous! What's with the pajamas? I know. Miguel gave them to me. You've got an email, Mom. IF YOUR DEBT OF 47,814 EUROS IS NOT PAID BY JUNE 20, YOUR HOUSE WILL BE SEIZED, AND YOUR LOAN OF 800,000 IS DUE. Hey, you can't just look through my phone! Are you crazy? They're going to tear down the house. Shit, how long have I said you need to get the house protected? Oh, it's not important! It's just things. Houses come and go. Are you sad? Well, yeah. That house... It's us. I understand. I don't, you said it was 50,000 euros. That's the arrears. If I don't pay, they'll take the furniture. But that said 800,000 euros. I mortgaged the house to pay for a film. It was a great screenplay. In the North of Canada. We made sets out of ice, it was amazing. The actor left, he was afraid of the cold. By the time we found another, it was spring, it all melted. -I know what to do. -What? Alvaro! -Where are you going? -Don't worry. Alvaro! I have to tell you something. -Can it wait till tomorrow? -No, it's too incredible. What's going on? You know what Baptiste just asked me? He asked me what year we met, you and I. And you know why he asked me that? Because he thinks I'm his father. I thought the same thing. You've seen how alike we are, the same face, nose... the radiant smile. Is that why you came? No, I wanted you to meet him. Stop, that is why you came, to introduce me to my son. You can't know how... surprised I am. Wait a minute. You can't be 100% sure. We should do a DNA test, right? No, I am sure. When I saw him, I felt a spark, and I've always wanted a child! It's great. It's great! Where was it? In Buenos Aires? The Hotel de la Naranja. That was it, with all the fountains, and there was a banana tree on the patio, I remember. You left for Paris just after. It was tough. Why didn't you tell me? I'm happy you're happy. Happy? I'm not happy, I'm delighted! I'm deliriously happy! This is the best gift you could have given me! You hear that, Miguel, we're going to be dads! Good thing you told me, I was about to proposition him. My own son. Can you believe it? Stop pouting, I'm joking! Go get us some champagne to celebrate. Go on! I'll leave you to your family. Baptiste! Come in, my boy! Come in! Come here. Sit down there. Sit down there. Your mother is an absolutely incredible woman. She is exceptional. You're lucky. And so am I. I have something for you. I'll be right back. You're insane. He guessed it! Well, not guessed... -He drew the conclusion. -We can't do this. I didn't say anything! He got excited, I said nothing. And you're the one who wants to keep the house. Look. I want you to wear these and keep them with you always. This is the sun, and this is the moon. They're like my coat of arms. Thank you. Suits you, huh? Well, before we have some champagne, -we have to take a picture! -Ah yes! -A photo! -Look here... Smile! Smile! I wanted to tell him, but he was so happy. There we go. I warned Jess about her car. She left her vacation and arrived unannounced. I was glad to see her. Thank you. -Hello. -Hello, I'm Miguel. -Miguel? -Yes. -Oh, you have an accent. -Yes, I'm Spanish. Ah, Spanish! Ah, bueno, mucho gusto. Yo tambien hablo español. I see, you speak it well. -Un poco pesado. -No, it's nothing. -Is Alvaro home? -Yes, he is. He's coming down. Please. Alvaro! The house was perfect for Jess, she loved its vibe right away. We celebrated Miguel's birthday, it was a great party. Mom was laughing. She made jokes, like she used to, like nothing had changed. It was like time had stopped. Like a break from our lives. Tell me... What? The boy was conceived in Buenos Aires? -Yeah. -At the Hotel de la Naranja. Yes, a fantastic hotel. There was a banana tree on the patio. And fountains everywhere, always flowing. It was superb. Wonderful. I have some bad news. -What? -It burned down. -What burned down? -The hotel. -Ah, that's a pity. -Yes. How old is Baptiste? Twenty-five, you said, right? Yes. The hotel burned down two years before he was born. And? And he's not your son! One year, two years, what's the difference? What do you mean? Nina isn't an elephant, she didn't carry him for two years! He's not your son, Alvaro! Qué no es tu hijo! I know. But it made Nina so happy. Go get my robe, I'm starting to look like a raisin. We stayed with Alvaro for three more days. We were happy together, like a strange, reconstructed family. And on the last day, Mom smiled at me, and there was something new in her eyes, something I'd never seen. And I wondered if it was my smile that had changed, if I had never seen her as I should have. This woman. Nina. My mother. Where is it? I can't find it! She told me she was going to try to adopt Nono. That she would be fine, Alvaro was going to help. Have you seen it? Come and help me! What are you looking for? My scarf! I thought about all the time we had lost, all the time we couldn't get back... Mom! It's on your head. I'm crazy! ...and I thought about all the time we had left, all the journeys we could make if we kept seeing each other like this. We told Alvaro the truth, but he already knew. In the end, I loved the guy. Nina! Oh, you're here? Come here. Sit down. How much do you need? No, Alvaro, stop right there. Calm down, Nina, I'm not giving you the money. I want you to do something for me. I'll explain. I have to send some diamonds to a jeweler friend of mine in Paris, and I want to do it discreetly. Why discreetly? In my line of work, when a deal isn't concluded, you have to be discreet. Can you do that for me? Of course. Good. Fifty thousand? -Fifty thousand diamonds? -No, 50,000 to deliver them. That's what my insurance wants, I'd rather you had it. -Here. -Thank you, Alvaro. Here, hide this. Go on. The diamonds are in the car, under the back seats. Goodbye, Nina. Hasta la proxima. It was great to meet you. -Likewise. -And thank you for the cat. Goodbye, cat. You'll be happy here. What are you doing? We're leaving. Oh no! Alvaro asked me to spend a few days with the boys! This house has such good energy. And with the cat. You're right, enjoy. -Goodbye. -Bye, Nina, dear. If Xavier calls you, I'm in Ostende for a vegan cleanse. You can count on me. -Bye, Jess! -Bye-bye, love! Hasta luego! I can't believe you gave her the diamonds. She's completely crazy! But I'm not. They're fake. I asked Jean-Paul to play along in Paris. And the 50 grand you gave her, is that fake? Come in, you'll catch a cold. Baptiste! A FEW MONTHS LATER... Baptiste, this is my inheritance. Do you remember my wall of memories? I started with your height, then the photos, then all the rest, year after year. It's all in this box. I don't know if you want to keep it. It's the past... Sometimes it's better to leave the past behind and sometimes not. It's what binds us to life. I think these last few months in the house have made me a little crazy, but then, I always have been, right? You know what your grandmother Léna always said: "Wisdom and madness sleep in the same bed." Love, your mother. Mom? Mom? You still don't lock your door? Babou... What are you doing here? You wanted to see it one last time? Yeah. I know it's sad to leave it, but you can't be too attached to things. Babou, come here! -You call him Babou? -Yes. -You want some toast? -You've grown. He didn't like camembert at first. Any news? From his father? What do you think? He writes occasionally. Show him your dad's postcards. He's doing well. Tahiti, San Francisco... He's coming back in July. But we're doing fine, us two, huh? -He's going to school. -I like school. And you talk now? I don't know about next year. I have to find an apartment. -An apartment. -An apartment. -What's this? -An apartment. The house is protected. I had to fight like crazy, but it's protected. They can't demolish it, they can't touch it. -And you get to keep it. -But I've been evicted. Someone bought it. Who? -You didn't call your father... -No. Jess? -She did that? -Yeah. You know, I've thought for a while, she's been acting strange. -How did you do it? -She's my godmother. She's going to pay it all off. She just wants the house to be in my name. I thought we could share it. We could take the upstairs. With Elke? -You got married? -Yeah. Babou... Wait. She didn't expect it, and neither did I. I'm happy I could do it for her. I'm happy she could count on me... that she could count on someone. She doesn't have many people she can count on. We all have a mother. We build ourselves around them, wherever there's room. And we grow up with a mystery that we'll never solve. And one day, we see them as a woman that we've met in life, who we can love simply for who they are. Subtitling: Hiventy
