It's heavy... Announcement to students. Announcement to students. "Campus closure Graduation Exhibition Cancelled" Due to the spread of COVID, the campus will be closed tomorrow... The school’s going to cover the cost. The exhibit is cancelled too. What a waste. We put everything into it. What about all this? Who knows? Can't they do something? Like what? There's nothing we can do. Hello? I'm calling about the cancellation. Yes. We never expected to be in this situation. The university is cancelling everything. The Graduation Exhibit. Those who want to take home their work must do so by the end of today. The campus will be closed as of tomorrow. Hey. Need help? I'm fine. Thanks. Really? It's heavy... Can you manage? Yeah. I'll be fine. All by yourself? Yeah. No problem. Yeah. No problem. Is that all of it? This is the biggest one. This is the biggest one And other smaller pieces. I don't know...but I think I'll work on it at home if I have the time. Wow... They're all pretty heavy and hard to carry. I wasn't thinking. At least you can take yours home. Some students have to trash their pieces. Yeah, I saw that. The Design students were crying, tearing down their work. Your mask is cute. Sorry. Social distancing... It's cute. Thanks... It's the washable kind. A bit of a hassle. I wouldn't mind. Your work... The school will store it, right? Don't know yet. Really... The teachers are panicking out. I don't blame them. They'll probably store it for me. Yeah. That's good, then. Not really. I can't believe it's actually cancelled. Yeah. I guess there's no other way, right? Not the time to hold an exhibit. It's weird I realized how much I wanted my work to be seen. It was all packed and ready to load onto the truck. What was it all for? It's like our art is reduced to trash. Trash... It's so frustrating. Argghh! Dammit! Ow! It's heavy... Ribbon It's done... “Still painting?” “Not even.” Seriously? Hey! Itsuka? It’s been a while. What's up? I'm so bored. Me too. But I'm hanging my laundry out to dry now. Wait, I do that every day. Every day? You wash one day's worth of clothes? Isn't that normal? How can you do laundry everyday, when you live by yourself? So it doesn't pile up. Incredible, Hirai. How much have you piled up? One week's worth. That's so much work! Washing every day is worse Now I know why your room's super clean. I'm so bored, I clean all day. Seriously? That's creepy. Don't even. My room's messier than ever. Maybe that's why I'm always. bumping into things around here. Check out this bruise. That's even creepier! I had to clear this space behind me just to take your call. Your call came out of the blue and caught me off guard. I just saw your room's a mess! Unbelievable. You need to clean up. You wouldn't normally see this. I was rushing. I'm catching glimpses. Really? Fine. I'll go out on the veranda. One minute. You have time now, so clean up. I don't have time. Are you busy? By the time I wake up, it's almost 3:00 pm. Get up earlier then! I'd like to. Then do it. Wake me up, Hirai! You know I get up at 6:00 am. Seriously? Every morning? The day's longer that way. No kidding. Should I wake you at 6:00 am? No. Thank you. Fine. I'll come by when I can. Sure, Come over. Whenever that will be. I know. It's hard to plan anything. Working on the painting? Not at all. But it's basically finished, right? Yeah, sort of... I just thought I'd put on some finishing touches. But I dont feel like it. I used to be able to paint at home. I wonder why? I wonder. I'll call you when I have time. OK. Clean up, now. Clean up, now. See you. Bye. Bye bye. It's heavy... I was lucky I could take mine home.

Whoa! Whoa! It's still noon. Mom? You came. I was so worried, I had to come! Whoa! Your hairs a mess! You weren't sleeping, were you? You scared me, Mom. You scared me! What are all these shoes? Stop, stop. Just leave it. Are you kidding? Your room must be a disaster. As always. So it's a mess! As always! Yup, it's a mess. Are you sweating? Of course! There's no ventilation in here! Why are you wearing all that? For protection! Just sanitize. Those sprays dry out my hands. I see. I'll get a towel. Don't sweat all over the floor! That's impossible. Here. It's so hot! Oh, my. What a mess. Why are you surprised? It's always like this. It's nothing to be proud of. You really don't have to clean. Huh? What? Itsuka, dinner's ready. Looks delicious. You love hamburger steak. Yup. It smells yummy. Are you eating properly? I cook. Not snacking all the time? You have to cook sometimes. I do. When I have the time. I'm eating! Go ahead. I'm in heaven. Really? It didn't turn out right. It's delicious. You didn't have nutmeg so I used pepper instead. - Is it awful? - It's good. It turned out so good the other day. 100 times better than this! I said it's good! Why do you have to ruin it? Really? Is it that good? Not any more. Tell me one more time. Is it really good, Itsuka? Your attitude is terrible. You'll never get married. Never mind. I'm still a student. Your attitude is terrible. Sarcasm isn't attractive. I'm not like this with other people. How would I know? I've never seen you with other people. I was grateful, but now I'm just annoyed. You were grateful? Itsuka. Not anymore. There's that attitude again. You're so annoying. Mom, where did you put that unfinished painting? Unfinished? The big one I left there. Oh, that. I took it. Took it where? Your rubbish area is outside, right? Yeah. So? It wasn't easy without an elevator. You mean you threw it away? There was all this stuff stuck to it. I thought it was rubbish. No! How could you? I can't believe it! That wasn't just doodling? Was that really a painting? Of course! That was my work. That's not a piece of art! Dont say that! I put a lot into that piece! I can see if you painted something, like your friend, Hirai. But that looked like a child’s project. Hirai is Hirai and I'm me! I think I'd better be going. Dad will be waiting. Make sure you eat. And clean up. Why won't you apologize? Why? You didn't tell me not to throw It out. I shouldn't have to tell you. This place is so cluttered, how was I to know? Your paints and brushes are there. I left the important stuff. This is important to me too! It's not for you to decide! You're my mom. How could you throw away my creation? Was it that terrible? That I worked hard to clean your room I'm not blaming you for that, but... Don't touch my stuff. I'm still working on it. I'll go then. I'm going! Go! I'm actually not painting anything right now. Coming... Dad? Hi, Itsuka. What the hell is that? “Social distancing" right? Yeah, but do you have to use that? This is to ward off burglars and stuff. People gave me weird looks. Lucky no one reported you. Vent, vent. The police stopped me. No way... So what happened? I asked him to maintain "Social distance" He said, "Oh, I see. Please take care." Then he left. That's so irresponsible. He was nice. People move away when they see this. Quite useful. People move away when they see this. Quite useful. They think you're crazy! It's handy! Leave it here. Don't go out with it! Really? I'll leave it if you'll use it. No way. But leave it here. It's so embarrassing. No way. But leave it here. It's so embarrassing. Would you rather be embarrassed or dead? Who was stopped by the cops? Wanna eat? What? Fruit jelly Yes. No spoons. Is it good? Yeah. That's good. Mom came yesterday, right? She was upset. Did she send you? She said, "Go check on her.” Seriously? And, "Take her some fruit jelly. Her favorite." This is from her? You should've told me. I wouldn't have eaten it. Mom... Is worried about you. she didn't understand your art. She wanted me to take a look. At my painting? Not me? She said, "I don't get it." "It looked like she's just playing around.” That's mean. She wonders if you're ready to be an adult. Or get married. I'm too young for marriage! What the hell? It wasn't me. I know. What about your job? Is the offer still good? They haven't said anything. I see. Well... Who knows, huh? It's good. See you, Itsuka. See you. I'm sure your painting will turn out great. I'll try my best. Bye bye. Oh my god. Sis! Mai? What a surprise. Sorry. You're just like Mom and Dad. - Were they crazy? - Insane. Why come separately? Social distancing, of course. I Suppose. You cleaned up! Mom went crazy with the cleaning. Well, good. It was so annoying. You're always annoyed. This time was the worst. Why don't you take it off? Take what off? All of it. Are you "negative"? I haven't been tested, but I think so. "Positive"? Then you shouldn't be here. It's not safe. I check my temperature daily. I don't have a fever today. Will you take it off if I check my temperature? Please? Please take it off! OK... Forehead. 36.2 °G. It's so hot. Don't you have a fan? No. What about A/C? Open the window. How long will this room stay clean? Not much longer. It's still pretty clean, I guess. How can it get messy if I'm not doing anything? If Mom didn't come, it would still be a mess. I know... Mom was wearing so many layers. Ridiculous, right? Dad brought that stick. - That's crazy. - He was stopped by a cop. He bragged about it all day. No way. The whole world’s gone crazy. We're watching the news so I'm sure they're aware. You're all into it, too. Seriously, I don't wanna get infected. Right. Did the police stop you, too? Nope. Neighbors didn't suspect you? I tried to be invisible and walk in the shadows. What are you, an assassin? No. I Know. I'm thirsty. I have tea or water. - Barley tea, then. - I only have green tea. - Coke, then. - Sorry. - Orange juice. - Water, then. With ice, please! Itsuka, come here. - What? - Give me your hands. I feel too lazy to go home. Sleep over then. Really? Are you sure? I've only seen Mom and Dad. I feel like talking. Me too. I only see Mom and Dad now. - I wanna go on a trip. - Yeah. And we never go out. I know. I wanna travel! What are you, Buddha? Shut up. In the middle of your forehead? It's stress. - Mom? - And Dad. Dad! His life revolves around Mom. I ate the jelly without knowing it was from her. It pissed me off. She asked me to bring you pastry. I refused. Mai... You're my only ally! Don't touch me! - Don't touch me! - Mai! Mai! Get up, Itsuka! Just a little longer... It's already 11:00 am. One more hour... It's nice and quiet outside. I want to go out. There's bread in the freezer. I know! I ate some already. I made lunch. Let's eat outside. Go fry some noodles. I made a fried noodle sandwich. Let's go for a walk! There may be people... I'll find a quiet spot. Come on! You look so scary. It'll be fine. No one's out. It's nice out here! Right? Hold on! - You can sit. - Thank you. Let's eat. Mai's special. Fried noodle sandwich. One half has more sausages. This one! Wrong. I knew it. Bon appetit. Looks good. Good. Mayo would've been good. Yeah, maybe. It's delicious. I should've Brought mayo. Mai... - Mai. - What? Look. What? Can you see that? Oh my god. That's scary! Oh my god. Ihat's scary! Scary, right? It looks like a human being. I think it's alive. A real person. A living spirit? A living, breathing person. I thought it was a ghost. No I've seen him sitting there before. - Look, look! - He's looking. - He's looking this way. - It's so scary! - He's looking this way. - It's so scary! Really? Stop staring! Stop it! Think... I'm scarier. You're both scary. No, I'm scarier. It's not a contest! Let's go already! Bring it on! Come on, Mai! Let's go! Let's go! I lost! That was close. Scaredy cat! A strange guy coming our way? I guess. I think I've seen him somewhere. - Do you know him? - Not me. Don't you know him? No way. He's SO SUSPICIOUS. Wasn't he in your grade? I couldn't see his face. But I doubt it. He had a mask on. Maybe without the mask... Ask him to take it off next time. No way! How awkward. Plus we literally fled from him. Oh, come on! Seriously? I looked back to see his reaction. He was just standing there, Staring at us. Poor guy. You don't care, do you? Of course not. That's why it's fun. Ouch! Dinner.... Dinner... Is served. OK. Bon appétit! How is it? Is it good? The best. Yummy. Super yummy. The best. It's SO good. Thanks for having me over. I was bored anyway. Too much time on our hands. Yeah... See ya. Mai! That's creepy. So rude! Were you always like this? I've been so isolated. But it's creepy! Stop saying that. But not now, next time. See ya. Bye. "I'm so bored.” “I wanna see you in person, Hirai.” Asakawa? Huh? Itsuka Asakawa? Yes...? From Art Club in middle school? Middle school? It's me, Tanaka. Your classmate from 9th grade. 9th grade... Tanaka? Yes, Tanaka. Thank goodness. It's you, Asakawa. Your painting s amazing. And cool. Your voice...is lower. Yeah. And maybe your hair's different? I guess. It's been 6 or 7 years, right? Yeah. Since we graduated. I guess Things have changed, and the mask... I didn't recognize you! I see. I kind of recognized you, though. Really? Do you...come here often? Did I look suspicious to you? No! Not at all! Good. It's been a while. Yes, it has. It's weird. I can't see your face with the mask on. Yeah. Things... have been tough. It's crazy all over the world. Yeah... See you, then. Your mask! Don't forget to wear your mask. Sure. Middle school, huh? It's the mask... “Mai!” “The suspicious guy at the park was my middle school classmate! Can you look at my yearbook?" Hello? Hello? You talked to him? Yeah! No, he talked to me! Seriously? His name is Tanaka. Remember him? I remember his face, but not his name. I remember his name, but not his face. I wonder which is better. Never mind. Get my yearbook. Is it with mine? I think so! Let me look. Mom! No, don't ask Mom. I know where it is. Where? Next to the reference books on the bookshelf. I'll go look. Thanks. OK, where should I look? There. Way over on the right. Here it is. Is he in there? Is he? Hold on. Let me open it. Hold on. Let me open it. Hold on. Let me open it. It's Tanaka. Exactly how it sounds. Here he is! Yeah, I recognize him. Show me! "Kensuke Tanaka" I can't tell... Send me a picture. OK. Thanks, Mai! So that's what he looked like. Thanks, Mai! Is that him? Yes! But I don't know if this Tanaka is the suspicious guy at the park. But he said so himself. But he was wearing a mask. And his hair was different. Tanaka is such a common name. Plus his voice sounded different. From middle school, of course. Did you recognize him at all? I couldn't even tell, with the mask on. But I did. Well... Why don't you ask him to take off his mask? I can't do that! Or if he's really Tanaka. That's rude! Why are you so interested? Why...? Why...? Why is that? Stop repeating yourself. Sorry, but I remember him complimenting me. Who, Tanaka? Yeah. He said my painting was amazing and cool. Yeah. He said my painting was amazing and cool. I remember it so well. I do too! You were so excited that someone thought your work was cool. I may have been. Your painting had a lot of stuff stuck on it, so people made fun. Shut up. But Tanaka complimented you, and you really got into painting. Did I? You were so annoying. I was? Every day, you yelled, "Im going to be an artist!" Oh, yeah... It's nice you saw him again. I just remembered! Didn't you wrap it up and give it to him at graduation? I remember now! You took me with you to buy wrapping paper, remember? How embarrassing! Here I am, an unknown artist giving someone my painting! I was embarrassed for you. You were? But you don't know how he felt. Do you think he still has it? You mean now? Did he throw it away? Who knows. Did he throw it out as soon as he got home? If you care so much, just ask him. Ask him, "Do you still have that painting? I can't! I don't even know if that's the real Tanaka. You're still not sure? I'd ask if I was sure it was him. If he took off the mask. Youre such a pain. Take it off... Take it off... Take it off... Hello. Tanaka! I bought two almond jellies by mistake. I can't eat them both. So have one. Yeah. It's really good. Especially if you eat it at the park. Yeah. It's really good. Especially if you eat it at the park. I sanitized my hands. It's safe. Thanks. I'd better be going. Bye bye. See you. Eat it. Come on, eat it! Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Thanks for the almond jellies. You're welcome. - It was good. - Um... I bought two pastries again. Want one? But you're always giving me stuff. If it werent for this pandemic, I'd eat it with my friend. If you insist... Please! Eat it right away! It's fresh from the bakery. Still warm! It's better when it's warm. OK. I have an online seminar So I'd better be going! You still have seminars? Sure. All subjects. I see. Good luck. "Alarm" Yum. "Hirai. What are you up to?" "Hirai, Hirai, Hirai." "Can you talk?" Itsuka? Hirai! You finally called back! Did you lose your phone? Was it turned off? No. There's so much I want to tell you. Can you talk now? Itsuka, I may be screwed. I might get expelled What? Hirai! What did you do? I snuck into school to paint. You snuck in? Yeah. How? I just did. But you can't do that! Are you stupid? What if you really get expelled? You can't go to grad school. It's not for sure yet. But you broke the rules, right? It's tough for all of us! Do you think you're special? I have a job lined up, but you're going to grad school. Don't be so stupid! So getting a job makes you better than me? Good for you. You found a job in this environment. That's amazing! Congratulations! Talented people get to do whatever they want. Think you're too cool? Immune to the pandemic? Some kind of hero? How noble! What the hell are you doing? I was painting! That's what! Why should I be punished for that? Hello? Itsuka Asakawa? Yes. I'm with Hibari Design Studio. I'm sorry to inform you that we are withdrawing our offer. Withdraw... Yes. The COVID crisis is affecting our business. We can't afford to hire anyone. I hope you understand I see. I'm sorry. Please take care. You're my mom. I'm sorry but we have to withdraw... Social distancing... the campus will be closed... We can't afford to hire any new employees. I was painting! What the hell? Why should I be punished for that? I'm sick of it! Sick of it! It's too early. It's too early. God! Morning. What time do you think it is? You're up so early. I was still sleeping. What? What? What is it? What's wrong? You have to speak up. I want to take home my painting. Itsuka. Help me. So it's all on me? Your painting's too big to carry out. What about courier service? Will it even fit in your house? No... I want to take it home. - Now? - Now. - Like now, now? - Now. Right now? That's impossible. Just make it happen, Itsuka. You're being unreasonable. Do something. Do something? I don't give a crap anymore. You sure? Tonight, then. OK. Where shall we meet? School entrance. OK. Bye. I'm here, Hira. What's all that? Just stuff. You're so nimble. Your stuff. Oh, right. Thanks. What now, Hirai? It's unlocked? Security's making rounds now. Is it safe? Be careful. Are you serious? This way? Yeah. It's dark. It's night. - Are there ghosts? - I've never seen any. Good. Here it is. It's locked. We'll be expelled for sure. If they find out. I'll tell them it's your fault. This was your idea, remember? What? You asked me! I just said I wanted to take home my painting. Liar. Should I turn this on? So you've been painting during lockdown. What about you? Nope. It's my fault. No. Because of what I said before? I felt bad, but that's not why. You should've asked me. I would've been your lookout. You called me “stupid” yesterday. You are stupid. You're right. I am. But this is kind of fun, sneaking in. Yeah. Thrilling. Why are we doing this? I heard that people can live without art. But not us. No, not us. You, me, or anyone really. You brought that? You have to destroy it. Even if it makes you cry. Destroy it? With that? I have a saw, too. You said you don't give a crap, right? You came prepared, huh? I don't care. I'm taking it home. No turning back now. Go, Hirai! OK! Itsuka? Are you crying? Well... All the time you spent on it... Why are you crying? Because four years of your life went into this work! How do you know? I threw away my own painting! You did? Yeah! I threw it away! I'm so mad! I spent four years on it! What for? It all went to waste. I'm so mad! Give back four years of Hirai's life! Keep it down! What if someone comes? I'll say, “I'm just taking home my own painting!” I'll protect you! Just keep it down! All done. It's heavy. Get the light. OK. Are you OK? Yeah. - Oh my god. - Are we expelled? Let's go, you idiot. - Wait! - Run! Who's there? You're so fast, Hira. Where'd they go? No one's following us? It's all your fault. You started chopping it down! You brought an axe! I was swept up in the moment! You shouldn't have asked me to help you. I forgot you can't take a joke. This is it. Thanks. Was it too much? Rationally speaking, yeah. “Artwork destroyed by art student.” Should we glue it back? It's kind of cool this way. Like this? This is what our frustration looks like. Then you finish it. Me? Jazz it up. I can do whatever to it? Give it to me. What are you doing? Shoot! Itsuka! Wait! We'll be caught! Don't leave me! I'll escape, even if you get caught. What about protecting me? We're fighting now. Get over it! No way! Didn't you say you were going to protect me? I'm not getting expelled! I'm leaving you. - Isakawa. - Hello. Can you stand right there? Is this OK? Distance-wise? More than enough. Yeah. We've seen each other but we've never really talked. I know. This is... The work I threw away! Oh, good. It's yours. I found it in the rubbish area. What do you mean? I guess we live in the same apartment. No way! I saw you once but I wasn't sure. Oh, wow. And... I thought this may be yours. I felt funny about just leaving it there. This... is amazing. Really? My mom said it's a mess. That it's not real art. Oh... But I like it. It's cool. You said that to me in middle school. I was really happy. You gave me that painting on graduation day. Sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you. It was no trouble. It was no trouble. I didn't know if I deserved it. Do you still have it by any chance? I always wanted to ask you now I should hang it. Things are sticking out. It doesn't look right in a frame. I still don't know if I should hang it "as is." You still have it? Yeah. You gave it to me, right? I thought you would've thrown it out. Don't throw your work away. Are you OK? Thanks. Not at all. I'm going to do my best. See you. It's not trash. Vent, vent. Smells like paint. “Graduation thesis by Itsuka Asakawa and Sachi Hirai" Come in. Thanks. What do you think? It's beautiful. Thanks. So much ribbon. I know. It's not trash. Nice. Yeah.
