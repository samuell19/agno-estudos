[music playing] TAXI DRIVER: Walker's Terrace is that new place, isn't it, just off of Fifth? I remember when they opened that place. It's pretty fancy. You know somebody that lives there? You picked a good time of day. Another hour and you couldn't get through here with a bulldozer. OK. That's, uh, $2.80. Yeah. Thanks a lot. [music playing] MARK POWERS: If you're finished dressing in there, I'll wait and we'll settle that other detail, hmm? [music playing] Gotta tell you, though, in the long run, you're not gonna like it. [phone ringing] Myrtle? [gunshots] [gasp] MARIE: It's just one of those days, you know? I've had two cancellations, and everybody else is late. You mean me? MARIE: No. Oh, here comes your late friend, Mrs. Wood. What's with you people today? [phone ringing] Oh hi, Lynn. Marie, I'm sorry. I've been running all over town with a client. Must have shown him a dozen houses. Nothing pleased him. MARIE: Well, at least you're here. I'll get Florence to do you. She'll be free in a minute. CHRISTINA WOOD: Thanks a lot. I'm running a little late myself today. I had to go into the City. Lord, my nails are set. I wish I had time for a manicure. Oh, yeah. If you don't hurry, you'll miss Larry's train. No. Actually, I told him to take a taxi. I just don't feel up to meeting trains today. You don't? MARIE: Florence can take you now, Mrs. Wood. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well, you will be at the club tonight. I-- we'll see. Oh. You've got to. It's Friday night, Lynn. We never miss. FLORENCE: Mrs. Wood! Please. Mrs. Wood! MYRTLE HOLLANDER: It's just so incredible. I mean, why, not two hours ago-- oh, thank you. Oh. My hands are still shaking. DETECTIVE BENNETT: Take your time, Miss Hollander. Relax. We've got plenty of time. And I mean we're more interested now in what happened after you found the body. Did you see-- SHAFFER: Good afternoon, Inspector. DETECTIVE BENNETT: Have some more tea, Miss Hollander. Excuse me just a minute. Shaffer, take over a minute, will ya? Twice through the chest with a .357. Second shot was a waste of ammunition. GEORGE DONAHUE: Close range, huh? DETECTIVE BENNETT: Two, three feet, tops. GEORGE DONAHUE: Well, it's obvious the door was closed when he was shot. DETECTIVE BENNETT: Yeah. Oh, yeah. GEORGE DONAHUE: He had to be on the other side when it happened. DETECTIVE BENNETT: Worked up quite a sweat, right? GEORGE DONAHUE: Sure did. But was it worth the price? By the way, do we have anything on the gun? DETECTIVE BENNETT: Just that it was his. Suspect dropped it on the way out. They're still dusting for prints. GEORGE DONAHUE: Well, tell them to hurry with the results. I'll be waiting. DETECTIVE BENNETT: Check. Just as soon as they finish. GEORGE DONAHUE: Who's with her? DETECTIVE BENNETT: Shaffer. Thank you, Shaffer. DETECTIVE BENNETT: This is Miss Myrtle Hollander here I was telling you about. Inspector George Oliver Donahue. GEORGE DONAHUE: How do you do, Miss Hollander? MYRTLE HOLLANDER: Hello. GEORGE DONAHUE: Is your tea all right? MYRTLE HOLLANDER: Oh, yes. It's fine, thank you. DETECTIVE BENNETT: I was just telling him you're the deceased's secretary. MYRTLE HOLLANDER: Well, I just worked for him part-time, you understand. It was just a few days a week. I typed up some letters and I ran errands. I was out on an errand when this happened. I was telling Mr. Bennett that. And I really don't know what else there is to tell you, really. Miss Hollander, Miss Hollander, I wonder if you could tell me who the woman was. MYRTLE HOLLANDER: No. I-- I already left when she must have arrived. And I would have no way of knowing which one it was. There were a few of them. Mr. Powers called them-- that really wouldn't interest you. GEORGE DONAHUE: Called them what, Miss Hollander? Well, he called them the hungry wives. It was just an expression. you understand. Miss Hollander, I'm wondering if you could tell us their names and perhaps give us a description of each one. Well, I-- yes, I think I can. But you realize this was just a part-time job for me, you understand. I really don't know much about anything that was going on here. GEORGE DONAHUE: Yes, I understand. And I'm sure you'll do the best you can. MYRTLE HOLLANDER: Well, there is an appointment book on the desk in there. And I'm sure all those names would be in there. GEORGE DONAHUE: Would you please show me? MYRTLE HOLLANDER: Oh. That's funny. There's something missing. I didn't notice that before. GEORGE DONAHUE: What's that, Miss Hollander? MYRTLE HOLLANDER: Well, there were two plain white envelopes. And each one had a woman's name written on it. Well, do you remember the name? No. But I'm sure they were both, you know, two of the hungry wives. I know. I know. I'm late, and I'm sorry so let's go. Where's Larry and Lynn? A woman's place, right? Where were you today, again? Didn't Larry make the train? Where's Lynn. Never mind that. He took a cab. Lynn didn't show. I have been calling you all afternoon. But Lynn never misses. They're coming to the club tonight, aren't they? Oh, cut it out. What do you want from me? I want to know where you were all afternoon. There's a blonde on your coat. Huh? Hair, that is. Must be Marcia's. Probably got it in the coat closet. Odd place to take your secretary, isn't it? Very funny. You still haven't told me where you were today. Oh, for gosh sake. I got Joey off to school and then I went to the beauty parlor. I did some shopping. And then I went to the club for some tennis. This is a tennis outfit, in case you hadn't noticed. Whatever. Karen, I-- I told the agency I was thinking of cutting back on my new business trips. Let a young account man take over that endeavor. What's that supposed to mean? Well, after all, I'll be 50 in a couple of months. Casanova was 60, if that's what you're talking about. RADIO REPORTER: In neighboring New York City today, police answered a call at the-- Listen. RADIO REPORTER: --Apartments, where the body of financier socialite Markus Trajan Powers was found shot to death. His killer is still unknown-- That's Mark Powers. RADIO REPORTER: --but police are looking for a woman believed to have been in the apartment at the time. Well, doesn't that shock you? RADIO REPORTER: Powers was 40 years old and leaves no family. In Washington-- Someone we know well has been murdered, for heaven's sakes. Haven't you anything to say? [music playing] TELEVISION REPORTER: Police are remaining comparatively tight-lipped about the Mark Powers murder, but insiders predict developments within 24 hours. [phone ringing] CHRISTINA WOOD: Vicki, the telephone! VICKI WOOD: Mother, you just missed the news. Somebody shot your boyfriend, twice, with his own gun. Or is that news to you? Hello? Hello! Flake hung up. CHRISTINA WOOD: Vicki, how would you like to visit your father in Florida? VICKI WOOD: Wait a minute. Why now after I've been begging you for years to let me go? CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, I called his office. VICKI WOOD: Why now? I want an answer. CHRISTINA WOOD: I left a message. I'll call him again. I think we need a rest from each other. I know I do. VICKI WOOD: I'll call him myself. CHRISTINA WOOD: He'll put you off again. VICKI WOOD: You put me off. [phone ringing] That creep again. If he breathes, blow a whistle in his ear. CHRISTINA WOOD: Hello? It's me. Now, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't blow up. Don't say a word. Is she still in the room? CHRISTINA WOOD: Yes. All right. Get her out. I heard you come in. I gotta talk to you. Chris. Please. Honey, it's a date. Is she gone? CHRISTINA WOOD: Yes. Why didn't you talk to here? What do you mean, why didn't I talk to her? I didn't have anything to say to her. Chris. Chris, what is this crazy message you left here? You can't be serious. CHRISTINA WOOD: I need to send Vicki down to visit you for a while, Carl. No. It's impossible. You can't. My wife would have a convulsion. I told you. She's jealous. I am not getting unnecessarily emotional. All right. I'm listening. Carl, I just can't! That's Daddy. You lied to me. Daddy? Daddy? Sweetheart. How's my little girl? I hear you blossomed into a raving beauty over the summer. I'm going to take a bath. Hey, listen honey. Now, you got to promise us, one of these days real soon you come down here and meet your new stepmother. She'll love you. She keeps talking about meeting you. Only one thing. You got to give us just a little bit of warning, because then we can get a chance to roll out the red carpet for you. But you gotta promise now. One of these days. I will. Yeah. I knew that. I told her. I know you do. I do too. It's her. [music playing] CHRISTINA WOOD [VOICEOVER]: The house is on Briar Drive, Mr. Powers, if you're familiar with the area. Otherwise you can come to my office and we can drive over together. MARK POWERS [VOICEOVER]: No, I'd rather meet you there. What's the address? CHRISTINA WOOD [VOICEOVER]: 128 Briar. I'll meet you there at 12 o'clock. [music playing] MARK POWERS: I'm late. CHRISTINA WOOD: Yes, you are. [music playing] You said on the phone you wanted the best we had to offer, Mr. Powers. This is it. MARK POWERS: What's upstairs? CHRISTINA WOOD: Five bedrooms, each with its own bath. Come on, I'll show you. MARK POWERS: No, that won't be necessary. Rest of the house furnished? CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, yes, of course. You sure you don't want to see it? With a living room like this, I doubt the rest of the house would be Salvation Army, Mrs. Wood. CHRISTINA WOOD: Then you like it? MARK POWERS: I did tell you, didn't I, it would be for only six months? Oh, yes. That's perfectly acceptable. MARK POWERS: Of course, it could be longer, depending on business. No problem. When would you like to move in? MARK POWERS: Tomorrow. Fine. I'll have the papers ready in the morning. My office, promptly at 10:00? You place great value on your time, don't you, Mrs. Wood? I'll try not to waste a minute of it. Mr. Powers. You didn't ask what the rent is. MARK POWERS: Would you like to tell me? $4,000 a month. Thank you. And I'll see you in the morning. [music playing] I was with him just an hour ago. And when I told him $4,000 a month, he never even blinked an eye. Can you imagine what it must be like to have money like that? KAREN MCCLURE: I imagine nothing else. OK. So what do we have so far? Mark Powers seems to be indecently rich, business unknown, but obviously profitable, eligible, a possibility. So what are you doing about it, lady? CHRISTINA WOOD: Not a thing. I'm not interested. Since the divorce, my husband's work. Who's talking about a husband? Then I give him to you. With the Surgeon General's blessing, he can be hazardous to your health. [laughter] I accept the hazard. Oh, not a minute too soon. Getting a little drunk out, isn't it? Karen, you wouldn't, would you? Wouldn't what? Cheat on your husband. Me? Cheat? When my husband takes his secretary on his business trips and not his wife? Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's having an affair with her. Oh, darlin'. It's a mess. It's OK. You go on ahead. I'm sorry. I've got to stop home and check about Vicki. KAREN MCCLURE: Oh, you don't have to go home to do that. I just left her at the tennis court. Are you kidding? She promised me faithfully she'd stay home and clean up her room today. Just remember, you can get more with a kind word and a club than just a kind word. See ya. KAREN MCCLURE: Bye. So I promised. So what right did you have snapping on me in front of my friends? Why should I have to clean my room anyway? We can afford a maid more than once a week! Why don't you hire a full-time girl and get the heck off my case? Don't you dare talk to me that way. VICKI WOOD: I'd rather not talk to you at all! I'd rather talk to my father! There's the phone. I'll ask him definitely this time to take me away. You know the number. You won't let him, will you? You always tell him not to. That's not true. You've always kept us apart. Anyone I love you always take from me! You're jealous! [music playing] CHRISTINA WOOD: Mr. Powers, good morning. MARK POWERS: Good morning. CHRISTINA WOOD: Please have a seat. MARK POWERS: Thank you. CHRISTINA WOOD: I have the papers all ready. Perhaps you'd like to read them over before you sign them. MARK POWERS: Oh, that won't be necessary. CHRISTINA WOOD: If there's anything you need to know about the house or if something goes wrong, please feel free to call me or have your wife call me. MARK POWERS: Oh, I'm not married, Mrs. Wood. Oh. I guess I'd just assumed you might be. Well, that's where you and I differ. You see, I never assume anything. I always check when I'm interested. You've been divorced for five years. You have one daughter, Victoria, 15 years old. And you are the best agent in this office. Now, would you have dinner with me this evening? Oh. I'm afraid I can't. You see, I'm having dinner with some friends at our country club here. It's a Friday night tradition. No is sufficient, Mrs. Wood. All right. Now here's a check for the first two months' rent. And that should take care of that. Oh, may I have the keys? Oh. Oh, sure. Thank you. [laughter] And it's a charity bazaar. You know, different booths and games, with gambling. Oh, maybe a fortune teller, huh? BILL MCCLURE: Just so it's not another one of those dances. Me and my slipped disco. The table will be ready in 10 minutes. LYNN BRISKIN: Oh, good. Then we've got 10 minutes to decide. KAREN MCCLURE: Is that him? He hasn't lost much time. LYNN BRISKIN: If everybody will just give me a definite maybe on the bazaar. KAREN MCCLURE: He's gorgeous. Who's gorgeous? It's a new edition. His name is Mark Powers, and he just rented the Corbett house. HARRY BRISKIN: When? KAREN MCCLURE: Yesterday. HARRY BRISKIN: He must be loaded. Don't just sit there, Chris. Go ask him to join us. I will not. LYNN BRISKIN: If he's that rich, I'll invite him to the bazaar. Now everybody bear witness. It's a bazaar. Come on, Chris. Be nice. He obviously doesn't know a soul. HARRY BRISKIN: Oh, why not, Chris? Middlegate hospitality and all that. Well, all right. I'll ask him. But don't be surprised if he says no. He's not the politest person I ever met. LYNN BRISKIN: He'll come. MARK POWERS: Oh, enjoying yourself, Mrs. Wood? CHRISTINA WOOD: My friends want to know if you'd like to join us. How do you feel about it? Oh, I agree, of course. I don't think so. You mean you'd rather not? No. No, I mean I think you'd rather I not. But, never could turn down a challenge, Mrs. Wood. CHRISTINA WOOD: Everybody, this is Mark Powers. The Briskins, the McClures. MARK POWERS: How do you do? LARRY BRISKIN: Nice to meet you. MARK POWERS: You know, I thought I was going to have to face an evening of absolute solitude. This is much more pleasant. LARRY BRISKIN: What would you like to drink, Mr. Powers? MARK POWERS: Ah, no. Let me, please. LARRY BRISKIN: Oh, no. No. You're our guest this time. MARK POWERS: No, I insist. Visitor's privilege. LARRY BRISKIN: Thank you. MARK POWERS: Waiter, another round, please. Do you play tennis, Mr. Powers? Well, they also serve who sit and watch. [laughter] Actually, I'm considering it. Oh! There's a very good instructor here at the club. Or I could teach you. I'm here almost every afternoon. I'll vouch for that. Mrs. Briskin, have you lived here long? Oh, Lynn, please. And we moved here seven years and two kids ago. Don't get her started on the kids, whatever you do. LYNN BRISKIN: It embarrasses him to admit it, but we happen to have two of the most beautiful, intelligent, and talented little girls on Earth, Misty 5 Lorraine 7. Would you like to hear all of the remarkable things they said and did today? If you're taking a vote, no. Don't let my wife fool you. We have a son. And she loves him more than anything else in this world. Oh, but that's different. He just happens to be one of the most handsome, intelligent, talented little kids on Earth. Now Mrs. Woods, you have a daughter, don't you? Yes. I have a daughter at home and an ex-husband in Florida. It's known as divorce. Bitter as all that? I'm sure you've checked. LYNN BRISKIN: You know, I wonder who spreads all those romantic lies about divorce. Oh, women who are married for keeps, of course. I mean, divorce is the last romantic dream left to the happily married woman. I remember the first time I dreamed of divorce. It was on my honeymoon. WAITER: Excuse me. Your table's ready. [music playing] VICKI WOOD: Would I? Are you putting me on? It's my main group. I've got every one of their albums! Mom! Oh! I love you! Oh! You'll never guess what. CHRISTINA WOOD: What? Tell me. I'll never guess. The Stones are coming to town and Mark is getting me press section seats free! CHRISTINA WOOD: Oh. VICKI WOOD: Oh, I love you. And I'm sorry. I'll never snap on you again and I'll clean up my room. Oh my gosh. I gotta call Beverly. She'll drop a brick. CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, hello. MARK POWERS: Hello. CHRISTINA WOOD: That was real nice of you. MARK POWERS: Well, now, Mrs. Wood, I do know how to be nice. Look, I'm about to throw something together for dinner. Would you like to stay? No, I'd rather not. You see, I have a somewhat previous engagement and I-- No is sufficient, Mr. Powers. Actually, the reason I've come, Mrs. Wood, I'm having a small party Friday night. And it's at my apartment in the City. I'd like you to be my hostess. Oh, then you didn't just come to my daughter tickets? No, no. Only as a means of ingratiating myself with her mother. You see, it came to me as an inspiration. I thought that if I could-- No thanks. I think I told you about Friday nights. Oh, yes. Country club night. What a pity. Well, then perhaps-- perhaps Mrs. McClure. She seems less of a traditionalist than you. Well, Karen isn't free either. You see, she's part of our-- MARK POWERS: Ah, but she feels she is. Well then, nice seeing you again, Mrs. Wood. CHRISTINA WOOD: You're going to ask Karen? MARK POWERS: Will you come? CHRISTINA WOOD: No. And neither will she, not if it means lying to Bill about where she's going. MARK POWERS: Oh. Didn't you know? Bill's in Chicago this week, business. [music playing] CHRISTINA WOOD: Hi there. How are you? LYNN BRISKIN: Oh, hi Chris. LARRY BRISKIN: Oh, Chris. LYNN BRISKIN: Oh, you look beautiful. CHRISTINA WOOD: Thanks. So do you. LARRY BRISKIN: Here you go. CHRISTINA WOOD: Thanks. WAITER: Good evening. CHRISTINA WOOD: Hi. WAITER: How are you? CHRISTINA WOOD: I'll have my martini, natch. WAITER: And I'll be back later for your dinner order. LARRY BRISKIN: Thank you. LYNN BRISKIN: OK. CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, where's Karen? LYNN BRISKIN: Oh. She called at the last minute. She's in the City. Ran into an old school friend or something. CHRISTINA WOOD: Oh. LARRY BRISKIN: And you knew Bill is in Chicago. I asked Mark to join us, but he couldn't make it either. Oh, and Chris, I had the most marvelous experience with him. I was just telling Larry about it. This guy is a gem, Chris. It was in the car with the children. I don't think I want to hear. You don't? But you don't even know what I'm going to say. Whatever. You all right, Chris? Look, both of you. I just wish you wouldn't encourage him, Lynn. He's not what you think he is. That's not fair, Chris. It is fair. I know him. This is difficult. I think he really wants to hurt you, Lynn. Or no, all of us. I mean it. I think he's cruel and sadistic and he'd run a spear through any one of us if it could hurt the others, particularly me. Totally paranoid, right? What? Or a little jealous, maybe? Is that what he says? You better tell me. No, it's just-- well, he did say that he wasn't like attracted to you the way you are to him. He warned that you might-- oh, Chris, let's not talk about it. Oh, he is cunning. Uh, listen, if you ladies would like to discuss this. No. Stay, please. Stay. Let's not talk about it. Let's just order dinner and I'll try to smother this primal scream I'm repressing. WAITER: Your martini. May I take your dinner order now? Yes, uh-- [phone ringing] CHRISTINA WOOD: Hello? MARK POWERS: Christina? I need you to come over. It's urgent. CHRISTINA WOOD: Mark? MARK POWERS: It's terribly important. CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, I just can't-- um. Wait a minute. What a time is it? MARK POWERS: It's 1:00 AM Tuesday. It's quite late. Please. I need you. [music playing] Well, well, well. Hello! Drink? CHRISTINA WOOD: Uh, no. I thought you said it was urgent. MARK POWERS: To me. You see, I've been fantasizing. I don't believe in fantasy. I believe it urgent that the fantastic be realized. CHRISTINA WOOD: What are you talking about? MARK POWERS: I want to make love to you. It was my understanding that I didn't attract you at all. MARK POWERS: [laughter] You've been talking to Lynn, huh? Well, I told her that to protect you, in case you wanted to keep our affair secret. I wouldn't have an affair with you if you were the last man on Earth. MARK POWERS: Why not? Why not, because you don't love me? Hell, you don't even like me. What's that got to do with it? I mean, hatred could be reason enough, or, uh, curiosity. And you are curious, aren't you? Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like, us together, my mouth on yours, bodies touching? Well, I have, all night. CHRISTINA WOOD: Why don't you leave us alone? MARK POWERS: Why don't you stay? CHRISTINA WOOD: Find another place and leave us alone. MARK POWERS: Why? Your friends don't feel that way. CHRISTINA WOOD: My friends don't know you. Well, Lynn thinks she does. You stay away from Lynn. She has Larry. There's nothing she needs or wants from you. MARK POWERS: Oh, no, no. That would mean that she was invulnerable. And we both know there's always a flaw, vulnerability. One simply has to find it. Why? Are you sure you won't stay? Why, for goodness' sake? Why do you have to discover people's weaknesses? To reach you. Oh, and by the way, I've already found your vulnerability. [music playing] DEALER: Same lucky shooter. Hey, Ace. Here it goes! Hi. Hi, Chris. Well, that's a nice donation. This? Oh. Don't tell Larry. This is my second $10 bill. But I can't help it. I'm having such a good time at the gambling table. Maybe I'll try the dice and save $5 for blackjack. CHRISTINA WOOD: Go get 'em! LYNN BRISKIN: OK. KAREN MCCLURE: That looks good. What is it? CHRISTINA WOOD: Some kind of pate, I think. It's delicious. You realize I haven't seen you in weeks? KAREN MCCLURE: Really? Has it been that long? CHRISTINA WOOD: Everything all right? KAREN MCCLURE: Of course. How else should it be? Life is a bazaar. BILL MCCLURE: Where have you been? You send me for a drink and suddenly you disappear? KAREN MCCLURE: Didn't you see the trail of breadcrumbs, darling? Exactly what in the hell is that supposed to mean? Everything I say-- Come on Bill. The dealers look so lonely. Karen, you don't mind if I borrow your husband? BILL MCCLURE: Mind? She doesn't care if you buy, sell, or use him as bait. I've already played blackjack twice today. CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, you didn't play with me. Now, be a grump, will ya? BILL MCCLURE: Maybe you'll bring me some luck, Chris. We got chips? CHRISTINA WOOD: Mm-hmm. Here's for you. Here's for me. BILL MCCLURE: Well, I'll put my bet here. CHRISTINA WOOD: Would you look at her? I never realized before tonight what a gambler Lynn was. BILL MCCLURE: Got married, didn't she? Stay. CHRISTINA WOOD: Hmm? BILL MCCLURE: Take it. Come on. Here we go! [car horn honking] Vicki! Vicki? Vicki? Where is she, for heaven's sakes? Vicki! [phone ringing] Hello? MARK POWERS: Oh, that's not very friendly. What do you want? I'm at my apartment in the, uh, City. I think you better come in. Oh, really. Just drop everything, hop a train? Yeah. As soon as you can. It's important, Christina. Like the last time? No, no. No, this time it's important to you. Game's ending, Christina. And you are the last play. There's a train at, uh, 1:17. You can't afford to miss it. [music playing] Ah, right on time. Come in. Come in. Drink? CHRISTINA WOOD: No thanks. MARK POWERS: I'm, uh, leaving for Europe at the end of the week, so actually I won't be needing the house anymore. CHRISTINA WOOD: I'm not surprised. Is that why you had me come down? You're not? Not surprised? Funny, I assumed you would be. That's where we differ. I never assume anything anymore. I check when I'm interested. Your application for the public land has fallen through. Our state has decided not to sell. One of the conditions of the land transfer was that only residents of the state would have been eligible to participate. That's why you moved to our town and why your residency is now superfluous. Mm-hmm. I'm not surprised. Magnificent. Magnificent! Well, at any rate, there's a check on the desk over there for the balance of the six months. CHRISTINA WOOD: What are they, those envelopes? MARK POWERS: These? Ah. These are a test of your morality. What if I told you that what's in these envelopes could ruin your friends, could split their lives apart? Furthermore, what if I told you that-- that you, you are responsible for their condition? Me? Yes. They are the victims of-- oh, how shall I say-- a game hunter who's really hunting you. CHRISTINA WOOD: What are you getting at? MARK POWERS: What I'm getting at is what would you do to redeem these? Hmm? CHRISTINA WOOD: You really hate women, don't you? It's your twisted ideal in one form or another to turn all of us into hustlers for you. --[laughter] You know, I really do keep underestimating you. I do. You-- you have no idea how, um, shall I say intimately right you are. OK. So now you know. So what? Get dressed. VICKI WOOD: Not unless he tells me. And if you're thinking of making trouble for him, forget it, because I'll deny whatever you say, Mother dear. You understand me? Leave him alone. Just leave him alone. All right, Victoria. All right. Go on now. You do as your mother says. You get dressed. MARK POWERS: I'll be leaving here on Saturday morning, so you'll have until Friday to collect these envelopes. Last day of the game. If you don't, my lawyer will know what to do after I've left. [music playing] [phone ringing] CHRISTINA WOOD: Hello? Oh, Lynn. I'm sorry. I was in the tub. Oh, Vicki? I guess she's in her room. We had a little scene and she's probably not answering the phone to spite me. Well, now wait a minute. I thought we settled that at Marie's. You can't cancel. You've got to be there tonight. Thanks, honey. I appreciate it. I'll see you tonight. Bye. So, guess it all points to our hungry wives, doesn't it? GEORGE DONAHUE: A little peek under the bed sheets of the American dream. Huh? Yes, it does. It all points to our hungry wives. From is notes in his calendar here, this being his last scheduled day in the States, I'd guess that at least three of them decided to pay him a visit. Two of them made it. Two? What do you mean? There were two women there when he was shot? It's the only way I can figure it, one on the inside, one on the outside of the bedroom. What I can't figure, I really can't figure out what is the connection between the two of them, if any? By the way, you didn't release any information on that gun, did you? DETECTIVE BENNETT: No. You said just that it was a .357. We didn't say whose. GEORGE DONAHUE: All right. Well, we're finished here. Listen, why don't you get started, make the arrangements with the police facilities at Middlegate. Get their permission to [inaudible] suspects alone, if possible. DETECTIVE BENNETT: Check. First thing in the morning, right? GEORGE DONAHUE: Ah, first thing tonight. CHRISTINA WOOD: What happened to the lighting? LARRY BRISKIN: Hi, Chris. They've gone into mourning over Mark Powers. I don't think that's funny, Larry. There's some kind of a power failure. They're working on it. Power. [laughter] Karen? Chris. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. I, I guess I was somewhere else. All night? Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here. I'm glad you could come and bring some female life to the proceedings. Our women are fading on us. Any more on the news? Just that they're pretty sure it was a woman. LARRY BRISKIN: Yeah, we heard that on the 6 o'clock. I think they probably know who she is. They just dont' want to-- KAREN MCCLURE [VOICEOVER]: Do you play tennis, Mr. Powers? MARK POWERS [VOICEOVER]: Actually, I'm considering it. KAREN MCCLURE [VOICEOVER]: Oh! There's a very good instructor here at the club. Or I could teach you. I'm here almost every afternoon. [music playing] KAREN MCCLURE: Oh, great! Oh. Let's take five. MARK POWERS: Well, it's nice of you to break up your game. KAREN MCCLURE: Oh. Only for a minute. They'll be coming after me. Do you wanna sit down? MARK POWERS: My thought precisely. Do you come here often, Mrs. McClure? KAREN MCCLURE: Karen. MARK POWERS: Karen. KAREN MCCLURE: Uh, well, during the daytime, yes. Helps keep my mind off the nighttime. Oh, I didn't mean that the way it sounds. I mean like, uh, dinner and cooking and cleaning. Well, say the drag of 400 meals a year, the small terrors of married life you don't read about in "Bride" magazine. MARK POWERS: I took the liberty. KAREN MCCLURE: Oh, thank you. Oh, you remembered what I drink. MARK POWERS: Cheers. KAREN MCCLURE: Cheers. Well, except for our Friday nights here at the club, we seldom go out to dinner. Bill's very much a homebody, when he's home. I mean, he travels a lot. Client trips, mostly. He's in the advertising business and he-- this must be very boring for you. Will he be taking another client trip soon? Uh, yes. As a matter of fact, he'll be leaving for Chicago on Wednesday for a week. MAN: Hey, Karen. Sounds like interesting work. MAN: Karen! I'm coming! My people. Well, I have your number, Karen. KAREN MCCLURE: Blasted traffic. BILL MCCLURE: Is something bothering you? KAREN MCCLURE: Oh, it's always a bottleneck here. Well, no. It's-- that's Christina's office. I'm sure she sees us. BILL MCCLURE: Oh, really. Is that Christina's office? [car horn honking] Does it bother you if she sees us? Well, no, I guess not. Because I should warn you. It would really bother her. Chris? Yeah. At the risk of sounding like the last remake of Don Juan, Christina has a certain feeling for me, which unfortunately I can't reciprocate. And as a result, I'm afraid she's been making things a bit difficult. Wow. That doesn't sound like Chris. Spreading alarms. Oh, I'm sure that among women, she's-- well, no, actually I prefer someone with a shade more brio, daring. [music playing] KAREN MCCLURE: Oh no. MARK POWERS: Who do you see now? KAREN MCCLURE: I think he's going out the door. I-- I think that was Peter O'Toole. MARK POWERS: Well, he's been known to come in here. You really are enjoying yourself, aren't you? I don't think I've ever felt so inside in all my life. This? Ah, this is only the keyhole. Listen, I'm giving a cocktail party Friday. Why don't you and Bill come? I'll show you the show beyond the keyhole. Well, of course. Why didn't I think of it before? 5:30. I can't. My apartment right in the City. Bill's leaving for Chicago tomorrow. He won't be back by Friday. Oh, that's too bad. That's right, you told me. Well, why don't you come? Of course, you come, be my hostess. Help me greet my friends, keep their cups running over. I don't think-- I don't know. Well,why not? You'd enjoy it, wouldn't you? Oh, yes. Of course I'd enjoy it. It's just that-- well, for one thing, I don't have anything to wear to such an occasion. To wear? Now, let's see, um, size 6. I'll have something fantastic for you. You're making it awfully difficult to say no. Then say yes. In your own time. Sleep on it. You don't have to give me your answer 'til tomorrow. [music playing] BILL MCCLURE: What-- what's all this? Bill, I've never-- BILL MCCLURE: Now Karen-- KAREN MCCLURE: Please, Bill? I've never pleaded with you before. BILL MCCLURE: I told you I-- well, I'm tired. I've got that long business trip tomorrow and I just don't feel up-- well, I don't feel well. KAREN MCCLURE: All right. Then take me on the trip with you. Please, Bill? BILL MCCLURE: Karen-- KAREN MCCLURE: Don't argue with me, Bill. Just do it. Take me along out of town, please. BILL MCCLURE: Karen! We've been through this a thousand times. You don't make any sense. Who's going to take care of Joey? KAREN MCCLURE: I could find someone. Besides, it's a business trip and I wouldn't have any time to spend with you. I could just be there. Yeah, be there. With who? You don't even get along with my secretary. I'm not going to be with your secretary. And on top of that, the agency would never allow for the expense. It's just-- it's utter insanity. Now forget it! Let's get some sleep. Yes, I know it's late. That's why I'm calling. No, no, no. That's just the point, Lynn. I won't be able to make it to the club tonight. I'm still in the City. Well, uh, actually I ran into an old school friend I haven't seen in years, so-- so we decided to make an evening of it, a movie, whatever. OK. Make my apologies for me, will you? Thanks a lot, sweetheart. Sensational. You'll be the queen of the tribe. [doorbell ringing] ---champion of the oligarch. And then she said, yes, but as an actor, he was truly underpowered. GUEST: Ernest knew it. I'm sure he did. He know if he ran just a little faster than he possibly could, he'd just fail to make it to the end of his life. GUEST: Darling, it isn't enough to be simply arrogant. He's also got to be [inaudible]. [laughter] I like your new pony. MARK POWERS: Well, I thought she might appeal to you, Willard. Green to the pasture, isn't she? Her favorite color. And does she wear your silks exclusively? Willard the Oblique. No, no. As you know, one of my deals has forced me to establish a six-month residence out of state. Oh, yes. The land project. And in the deadly interim, I've been amusing myself, playing out of hand. Karen is, so to speak, one of the hole cards. At stake is one Christina Wood. Someone a bit more glacial, I presume. MARK POWERS: And you know how I feel about glaciers. The only peaks worth scaling. GUEST: I had so much fun. KAREN MCCLURE: Thank you. GUEST: Thanks for having us. I'm afraid I'll have a headache tomorrow. Bye bye. MARK POWERS: Don't forget. KAREN MCCLURE: I won't. I'll call you if I change my mind. Thanks again. Good bye. Can you believe it? He thought I was an actress. He wants to represent me! Oh, it's incredible. It's incredible! This whole day has been-- [music playing] I can't believe so much has happened, all in one day. MARK POWERS: $500. You earned it. Yes indeed, every penny. I'll arrange for a car to take you home. [music playing] KAREN MCCLURE: Don't forget your handkerchief is in your back pocket! And use it! Good morning. What do you want? I'm in a hurry. -Get in. -No. Would you rather talk out there in the street? You remember Willard Durrell. Uh, yes. MARK POWERS: He called me last night to tell me he's going to be in town this afternoon. He is desperate to see you. If you don't mind-- MARK POWERS: Would you rather your husband-- You wouldn't. Ah, I mean, it'd be so middle class, wouldn't it, his finding out about Friday night? No, of course I wouldn't. That won't-- won't be necessary. Come on. Cheer up, my love. It's not the inferno. It's just an afternoon out of your life. And it's $600. I'm not a prostitute. I'd hope not. I'd hardly send a prostitute over to entertain a fellow as decadent as Willard Durrell. He's my closest friend, you know. All right now. 2 o'clock, my apartment. Look your best, huh? Don't be late. He despises tardiness. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] Oh, Mark said you'd be on time. DEALER: Seven. CHRISTINA WOOD: Hi. LYNN BRISKIN: Oh, hi, Chris. BILL MCCLURE: How are you? Karen, don't give me that suffering Madonna bit. You're never home anymore. Where in the hell do you go? KAREN MCCLURE: For god's sake, leave me alone. I went to the beauty parlor and then I was at the needlepoint shop. You want an affidavit? BILL MCCLURE: I want a wife. KAREN MCCLURE: Do you? BILL MCCLURE: I want a drink. That's what I want. KAREN MCCLURE: Makes two of us. A double. MARK POWERS: Ah well, the family that drinks together. What do you want? I need you Thursday. No. No more. -Mid-afternoon. No more. I'm done with it. Bill is starting to question every move. 3 o'clock. You don't care about your marriage, not worth a damn, and you know it. I'm not going. You care only about yourself. And if Bill found out, he'd take the boy from you in a minute. [doorbell ringing] MARK POWERS: Oh, come in. You're early. He's not here yet. It doesn't matter. I'm not staying. That's really all I've come to say. I'm not staying and I'm not coming back, ever. You can tell Bill anything you want. I'll deny it. It'll be your word against mine. MARK POWERS: Names, dates, amounts. It's all here, darling. You know, it's amazing, amazing how many dates coincide with Bill's trips out of town and the telephone messages he left when he couldn't reach you. Harry Sheldon, Tom Keller, Burt Fielding. Oh, oh. Burt. Bill Middler. Willard Durrell. Oh, he's going to be in town next week. He's very anxious to see you. Please, Mark. Please let me stop. What difference could it make to you? What possible satisfaction? [doorbell ringing] MARK POWERS: Charlie! Come in. Come in. How are you? This is Charlie. Yes, sir. Best mechanic in my garage. Be very nice to him, hmm? [music playing] LARRY BRISKIN: Karen. Karen? I'm sorry. I guess I was thinking. LARRY BRISKIN: We were wondering if you knew where Powers got his money originally. Well, I for one don't care. I've had enough of this subject. I'm going to the ladies room and get an aspirin. An aspirin? Honey, are you-- are you OK? Just a headache. I'll be right back. [music playing] LYNN BRISKIN [VOICEOVER]: I asked Mark to join us, but he couldn't make it either. Oh, Chris, I had the most marvelous experience with him. I was just telling Larry about it. LARRY BRISKIN [VOICEOVER]: This guy is a gem, Chris. LYNN BRISKIN [VOICEOVER]: It was the car with the children. [children chattering] LYNN BRISKIN: Now be careful, children. Don't go too far! Stay where I can see you! Lorraine, hold your sister's hand! Oh, I don't know what we'd have done if you hadn't come along. I still don't understand it. The darn engine in my wagon just wouldn't turn over. MARK POWERS: Well, now suppose I told you that I had sand put in the ignition. LYNN BRISKIN: [laughter] Oh. I've been planning this Indian picnic for about a month. Larry's got all the children absolutely hooked, hunting for Indian arrowheads. Larry says the Algonquins were-- Oh dear. I think Lorraine needs me. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. MARK POWERS: I'll wait. LYNN BRISKIN: Misty, now you have to watch more carefully, OK? Stay in this area. There are plenty of arrowheads right around here. This really isn't your cup of tea, is it? MARK POWERS: Well, tea isn't even my cup of tea. No, to be absolutely honest with you, I don't have a paternal bone in my body. Matter of fact, neither did my father. And fortunately, my mother had enough for both of us. My mother was the most possessively neglectful woman I ever knew. And I think you're the second nicest man I've met. Next to your husband? Next to my husband. You're very happily married, aren't you? I think I just might be the most happily married woman in the United States. MARK POWERS: And you're wondering why I never got married. Is it that obvious? MARK POWERS: Well, I've learned. I've learned. Every happily married woman is a closet missionary to the unwed. LYNN BRISKIN: Well, why haven't you? There's still time, you know? Well, I'm not really sure yet the kind of woman I want to marry. I'm only just beginning to find out the kind I don't want to marry. That's a beginning. I-- I don't want a woman who's vindictive or jealous, possessive. Well, Christina is a fair example. Chris? Yes. Somehow Christina has got it in her mind that I made some sort of emotional compact with her. And she keeps pushing it with a kind of-- Please. I don't want to hear. ---a kind of paranoia, speaking badly about me to others, denying that-- Please. Oh, I-- I'm sorry. You're not only a star-grade mother and wife, you're also an Olympic-class friend, aren't you? Don't you have a single personal weakness? Oh, damn! Just when I was going so well. Honey-- LARRY BRISKIN: Oh, now darling. LYNN BRISKIN: Just $5 more. After all, it's for charity. LARRY BRISKIN: And we're going to need charity if you don't quit. LYNN BRISKIN: Please? LARRY BRISKIN: All right. This is all I've got left, so make it last, huh? LYNN BRISKIN: Oh, you cheat! LARRY BRISKIN: Now promise, don't bet the children. I'll be in the bar. OK. Get outta here. OK. Here we go. All right. Damn, not again. How are you doing? Oh. Oh, hello. Not too well, I'm afraid. I keep running out of chips. -Oh. Well, we can't have that. Here let's both play this, huh? DEALER: We have a new shooter coming out. Good lord. That's got to be $100 worth at least. And if you don't help me lose it, we'll be here 'til Christmas. Well, what if we win? Merry Christmas! OK. All right, seven. Come on, seven, seven. All right! DEALER: Seven. Seven wins. OK! All right. Let's do that again, all right? There we go. My tab, please. Thank you. LYNN BRISKIN: There he is. Hi. LARRY BRISKIN: Oh, you did it, didn't you? Bet the kids. Ah, only the baby. Darling, something great. We've been talking about you. About me, I-- Oh, Mark. Tell him. It was her idea, actually. See, I told her I'm considering an entire new schedule of insurance. And I told him about this gifted and beautiful insurance agent I just happen to be married to. Oh. Well, I thought if we could get together somewhere informally, I could spell out my exact requirements. Oh, sure. Fine. Just name the time. Well, how about Saturday night? A little business and pleasure. Dinner at my country club. While you and I talk, Lynn can enjoy the entertainment. Oh, fantastic. Saturday then. Saturday night, then. Thank you. MARK POWERS: Good night. LYNN BRISKIN: Bye bye. MARK POWERS: This is really keeping up with the darn Joneses, isn't it? A private dining room of our own. I feel like Cyrus K. Vanderbilt. LYNN BRISKIN: I've never feasted so royally in my life. MARK POWERS: Well, I am pleased. Now, if you're ready, the entertainment. LYNN BRISKIN: Oh. Send in the clowns. MARK POWERS: No, no. Better than that. Why don't Lynn get settled in the other room and then I'll come back in here and we can get down to business. LARRY BRISKIN: Fine. Fine. MARK POWERS: Lynn? LYNN BRISKIN: OK. Bye. LARRY BRISKIN: Bye, sweetheart. LYNN BRISKIN: This is so nice of you. I can't tell you how much I appreciate what you're doing for Larry. MARK POWERS: It's my pleasure. LYNN BRISKIN: Really, I can't thank you enough. MARK POWERS: I have something there that I think you're going to enjoy. LYNN BRISKIN: This place is incredible. I had no idea. MARK POWERS: Oh, yes. Yes. Cards, dice, maybe perversity. But unlike your public casinos, this one is private, discreet, and illegal. DEALER: Place your bets. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. All best down. No more bets, please. Hold the bets. 7 black. Odd's the winner. LYNN BRISKIN: Why didn't you tell me? I've only got five silly dollars with me for my mad money. MARTIN: Mr. Powers, how good to see you. MARK POWERS: Ah, thank you, Martin. Thank you. This is Mrs. Briskin, a very dear and personal friend of mine. I'd like her to have an, oh, $2,000 line to play with. MARTIN: Of course, Mr. Powers. I'll take care of it right now. MARK POWERS: Thank you. LYNN BRISKIN: $2,000? Oh, no. I just-- I mean, we haven't got that kind of money to spend. MARK POWERS: No, no, no. This has nothing to do with your money. I have an account here. I want you to have a pleasant time. No, but $2,000. Mark, I just-- Listen. Listen. This is my mad money that we spend here. Expense account money that I either have to get rid of or pay taxes on. I'd much rather please you than the government. Well, maybe $100. All right. Maybe $100. But listen, you have $2,000, so please, take advantage of it. Now, what would you like to start with, roulette? Oh, yes. Fine. Sure. Oh, Martin. She'll start off with $100. MARTIN: Certainly, sir. Now, take good care of her, will you? You have a glorious time. I will. MARTIN: This is for our persona records, you understand. Oh. Yes, certainly. $100, please. DEALER: $100. All bets down. No more bets, please. MARTIN: Good luck. LYNN BRISKIN: Thank you. [music playing] DEALER: Three up. MARK POWERS: Sound program. I like it. LARRY BRISKIN: Yes. And then those commercial properties. We've got a new term policy that gives you just the protection you're talking about at half the premium you're paying now. I'd like to outline it for you. [music playing] Oh! Very nice. Very nice, indeed. Very creative package. I tell you what. Give me a week, say, 10 days to digest it and I'll get back to you. I'm very impressed. LARRY BRISKIN: Take all the time you need. MARK POWERS: Speaking of time, I think we better redeem your wife. LARRY BRISKIN: Oh, she'll be all right, watching a show. MARK POWERS: Show? LARRY BRISKIN: You did say entertainment, didn't you? MARK POWERS: Oh, that's right, I did say entertainment. But she's not watching a show. She's gambling. LARRY BRISKIN: Gambling? MARK POWERS: Yeah. LARRY BRISKIN: Lynn? Oh no. LYNN BRISKIN: I mean, I added their ages together and I got 12 and I won $600. Cut it out, Lynn. It was blind luck. No, but that's it. I'm lucky. Don't you realize? Think of it! I won $650. Just five nights like tonight and we could pay off all those bills we're drowning in. We could maybe even have-- Lynn, stop. As it is, I won nearly enough to pay off the car. That means-- -That means you're hooked. That means I won! And the next time you'll lose, or the time after. Then you've caught a disease. Kill it now, quick. Up to now your gambling's been a joke. The joke is over. You don't understand. They said I was good, I was a natural. I believe it. Larry, I never felt anything like that in my life. It was almost too exciting to breathe. If I go back, I know that I can-- Lynn! No! No! Let's go to sleep. Turn off the light. [music playing] DEALER: No more bets. All bets down. Ah, Mrs. Briskin. I see you've made use of the passkey. I do hope you're winning. Well, I'm not. As a matter of fact, I just lost what I won the other night. Ah, that's too bad. But there's the still the $2,000, you know. What? Oh, yes. Mr. Powers insisted that amount remain at your disposal. DEALER: Seven black. Well, maybe a few hundred. I'll get it for you, Mrs. Briskin. Thank you. DEALER: Place your bets. [music playing] 30 red. [music playing] 30 red. [music playing] 33 black, and odd. I'm sorry about your bad run today. But there'll be other days. Never. Not for me, ever. I'm finished gambling. Oh? In that case, then I assume we can expect your check in the mail. My check? For what? The amount you signed for, $2,000. You see, Mrs. Briskin, Mr. Powers' name isn't there, just yours. But I-- but I was standing right there when he told you to give me $2,000 to play with. He was asking me to extend that much of a line to you, a line of credit to you because you were a stranger to the club. And as a courtesy to Mr. Powers, we did. VOICE ON TV: You're lazy, you remember? And you were good, I told you, remember? BILL MCCLURE: That's silly. [phone ringing] Oh, I'll get it. -Oh, no. I'll get it. VOICE ON TV: Only you'll do it on the air, on Captain Parson's show. What do you think, Shari? Shari. Hello? MARK POWERS: Lynn? This is Mark. Where have you been? I've been trying to reach your for three days. Yes. I just heard. Listen, I've cleared up that club problem. You don't owe them a penny. Can you come and see me? I'll explain. Yes, of course I can. Yes. When? Uh, right now. Uh-- I'm at my Middlegate house. Make some excuse. I think the sooner we ease your uncertainty, the better. LYNN BRISKIN: Mark, you can't imagine how frightened I've been. $2,000. I had no idea where to get it. We spent every penny we'd saved last year when business fell off and everything went wrong. I was terrified. It could have ruined our marriage. I wouldn't know what to do if I had to tell Larry. Really, I think I'd rather die. Would you like me to tell him? What? MARK POWERS: Well, I could tell Larry. Tell what? You said I didn't owe them a penny. MARK POWERS: Oh, that's right. I haven't explained it to you yet. You see, I bought you markers, so you owe the money to me now. To you? Yes. But you-- I thought-- Mark, I'm all confused. You led me to believe that it was your money all along, somehow that you'd given it to me. MARK POWERS: Oh dear. I have no control over what you choose to believe now, have I? No, no. You see, the point is I'll be leaving for Europe in a few days. And you see, it's kind of a fetish with me. I never leave things unfinished. So you will have the money for me before I leave. Until then-- LYNN BRISKIN: Before-- Europe? But Larry's insurance proposals? Well, until then, I'll be spending most of my time at my City address. Oh, Larry, yes. You see, business deals work out and sometimes they don't. Larry's just didn't. Oh. Here, um, here are the markers, your markers. And, uh, they'll be waiting for you in the desk drawer of my City apartment when you bring the money. Well, I would presume to suggest that you get busy, because you only have a few days. I mean, that's all. [music playing] Why bother? Just going home to bed. And to my husband, that means TV and a bad night's sleep. I feel rotten. You know, I've suddenly discovered it's not his business trips I resent anymore. It's his staying home I resent. And I-- Oh, why don't you stop, Karen? Stop what? Just stop whining and complaining about your miserable life. If it's so miserable, then for God's sakes, do something about it. You're not in prison. No law says you have to die if you can do something about it. I'm sorry, Karen. I-- I'm just tired and upset. I'm a fine one to be spouting advice. VICKI WOOD: Uh, listen. Before the party ends up in here, I'm saying good night. I have a stop to make. I won't be leaving with you. Oh. You never did tell me why you wanted me to be sure and be here tonight. It's not important anymore. We've had some good times together, we three, haven't we? Good night, my friends. LYNN BRISKIN: Night, Chris. Where's my bag? KAREN MCCLURE: Outside, next to mine. I'll be all right. [music playing] BILL MCCLURE: Trouble is you've had too much time on your hands, which has been partly my fault. So, well, I've decided. Definitely no more out-of-town trips. I'm going to stay home with you, give some form to your life, give you some things to do. Oh, we could redo the house. You could do more entertaining at home. Hey, we could even build a play room on the house. That way you could cut out on that tennis hassle of yours. Get one of those video tape machines. Put it in the bedroom. See your favorite program day or night while lying in bed. How 'bout that? [music playing] What's that? LYNN BRISKIN: Nothing. Nothing that matters. The only thing that does matter now is I don't love you anymore. And I've learned that it can be murder, literally murder living with someone you don't love. A new game room isn't going to help anything. And, uh, a new toy in our bedroom isn't going to fix it either. I don't want anything from you at all, Bill. Except I want a divorce. [music playing] Well, I was sitting there and I was watching the 5 o'clock news. And then-- then when I heard it was Mark, I-- DETECTIVE BENNETT: Mark? Did you know him personally? VICKI WOOD: Of course I did. When did you first-- GEORGE DONAHUE: Uh, excuse me. You knew him personally. Now, would you say you knew him well? I'd say. Would you say that you knew him very well? What are you-- what? LYNN BRISKIN: Larry. LARRY BRISKIN: Mm-hmm. LYNN BRISKIN: There's a very good chance the police might want to talk to me about Mark. You? Sure you don't mean Missy? LYNN BRISKIN: I-- I did see him a few times, you know. And-- well, we went with him to that club, remember, the Garrett? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. It very nearly cost the company double indemnity. Lucky that deal broke down. LYNN BRISKIN: No, but, uh-- well, so, when the police start looking for motives, they're liable to find something among Mark's papers that might make me-- Honey, would you light my cigarette? LARRY BRISKIN: Hey. LYNN BRISKIN: What? Oh, uh, um, a cigarette, right. [laughter] You drunk, woman? [laughter] LARRY BRISKIN: You sure you're not drunk? Yes. I am higher than a balloon. I love you, Larry. [music playing] Listen. What I mean is, well, we understand. We're just trying to get to the truth, that's all. We're not blaming anyone. What I-- did your mother really know that you knew him, well, like that, so to speak? VICKI WOOD: Well, I mean, it wasn't just me that liked him. Everybody liked him. He was like your father. Even Momma, especially Mom. CHRISTINA WOOD: Vicki? VICKI WOOD: But she'll tell you she didn't like him, so don't believe her. GEORGE DONAHUE: Mrs. Wood. CHRISTINA WOOD: Yes? GEORGE DONAHUE: I'm Inspector Donahue. This is Detective Bennett. VICKI WOOD: They want to talk to you about Mark, so tell them. CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, all right. But I'm not sure what happened to him. VICKI WOOD: Tell them how much you liked him. They want to know everything. Go on. Tell them. Well, ask her the questions you asked me. GEORGE DONAHUE: Perhaps we could talk in private, Mrs. Wood. CHRISTINA WOOD: Yes VICKI WOOD: No! I've got a right to hear what she says. Vicki, what's the matter with you? I want to hear you admit you went to bed with him. Vicki! She was with him today, you know? So don't believe her if she tells you she's been making time with a client. She Wasn't. She was in the city in his apartment. Weren't your, Mom? Admit it. You see, she was jealous. She was jealous of me. That's why she went to bed with him to get him away from me. So she went there to his apartment and she made out with him and then she shot him with his own gun. Tell the policeman the truth. What's wrong with you? My god. GEORGE DONAHUE: Mrs. Wood, have you ever made such a confession to your daughter? No! Vicki, why don't you tell me again just how you think it happened. Well, it's all so up front. I mean it's right there for everybody to see. She went to his apartment and then she tricked him into bed. And then she went and got the gun from the desk drawer and she shot him. She killed him because he loved me, just like she killed my father away because he loved me too. Everybody I love she kills away from me! She takes them all away from me! GEORGE DONAHUE: I understand. I understand. Look, why don't you got outside with Detective Bennett and just relax. Get some air. We'll all be out in a minute. You do that for me like a good girl, huh? OK. [music playing] CHRISTINA WOOD: What's happened? What's wrong with her? GEORGE DONAHUE: Obviously she's not responsible. But I'm sure they'll take into consideration. CHRISTINA WOOD: Well, what do you mean? I'm afraid I'm going to take her in for the murder of Mark Powers. No. No, you can't. What she said was true. I was there this afternoon. I was in bed with him. I made a bargain with him. I can't tell you about it. GEORGE DONAHUE: Please. I'm really not interested. We know you were there. In your panic, you attracted a great deal of notice from the doorman. He described you right down to your shoes, and the cab driver who let you off at the station. Well, what more do you want? Something you can't give us. Something that only Vicki knew. Powers was killed with his own gun. We never released that information. But Vicki knew. We knew there were two women there. Obviously Vicki was one of them. And what she was describing just now was her jealousy, not yours. And the man, Mrs. Wood, Powers, was a real sickie. He's what our report called a pathological misogynist. Mrs. Wood? Mrs. Wood. I want to go with her. GEORGE DONAHUE: Well, of course. Why don't you call your lawyer and have him meet us? I'll wait for you outside. [music playing] DETECTIVE BENNETT: Fell asleep. GEORGE DONAHUE: Well, now we know what happens to hungry wives. DETECTIVE BENNETT: What's that? GEORGE DONAHUE: They raise hungry children. [music playing]
