My name? What difference does my name make? I am just a lover who finally found his place. My age? Even if I were one thousand years old. In your eyes, I will always be a child. And you will remain my only shelter. I have tales to recount. That no one else can put in words. And if I run out of words. Your eyes will remain my poem in exile. I am made out of love. And only for love I'd die. I will walk the whole earth. To tell everyone my story. A runaway lover who returned to you in remorse. Amal! Amal! Last night, I dreamt of my father. He was a policeman. He carried a gun and wore an officer's uniform. It was my 14th birthday. In January. A day of rage and chaos. People running all around in fear. I heard my father singing to me from far. "Happy birthday to you". But I was scared when I saw him on the other side with the police. What changed? I saw my father walking toward the tear gas' smoke, then he disappeared. He left me all alone. But I could still hear him singing. Singing to me... Then... everything went silent. I found myself lost. I couldn't find my way anymore. I didn't know which road to take. You bunch of animals! Hurry up! See how they obey me? - You, get out of there! - Why are you talking to me this way? - Get out! - I'll spray this on you. - Go away! - Screw you! Just get the hell out! What did I do wrong? - You're retarded. - Why? Because I'm singing? You'll get arrested. Let it be. I'm ready to go to jail. Talk to me as a boy, not a girl. Are you one of those hooligans? No. My boyfriend was. He died in that stadium. You think my hostility comes from nowhere? Let's sing! This revolution was a defeat for you. Who shall we tell. Our policemen are criminals. You took a hard slap on the face. The police are a bunch of thugs. You're a thug. Get out of here. Don't talk to us this way. To hell with you and your platoon. If you are afraid, don't come along. We will not obey your orders. Spare us your presence. They tried to divert our cause. As they always do with their dirty ways, The police arrested me and called me a terrorist. For holding a flare and chanting for my team. You bunch of losers, You failed in school. And joined the police academy. To control us in our house. Greetings to you all. We continue our film of summer 1997. We're at the beach. Today is August 18th, and Miss Amal can sit on her own for the first time as you can see. This is of course a great event. Hello Amal! Today, a group of honest policemen accused the Ministry of the Interior of conspiring against football fans and being responsible for the Port Said stadium massacre. The goal of this conspiracy would be to spread chaos and impose the current state of emergency... The train from Port Said has arrived, carrying the injured and the dead of the stadium massacre as well as the supporters who were attending the game. I wore a red shirt. On my way to Port Said. I came home in a white coffin. I am a martyr on my own land. Mustafa was my first love and my best friend. I grew up with him. On that day, I was so afraid. I begged him not to go to the stadium and to watch the game with me. He refused... He left, then he never returned. I can't bear the thought that he's forever gone. No words can express how I feel. So it's better to keep it all inside. Stop treating me like a man. Nothing scares men, you shouldn't be afraid. If I acted as a girl in the revolution. I would have been useless. I had to be a man. Same as them. So I could have a place, both inside and outside the clashes. But I don't know if I should be happy or sad. When they mistake me for a boy like them. - Till when will you play? - Midnight. Midnight? It's already 11.30pm. - There's too much traffic! - Who cares? It'll be midnight by the time we get to the metro. No, it won't. You want to hit me? - And you call yourself a man? - Yes! Don't you call yourself a man too? Don't cry Amal. Sit-ins are not for girls. Every time one of you guys curses me, and orders me to go home I'm not a child you can order around. No one treated you like a child. It's late and you're the only girl here. Sit-ins are not for girls. You must leave or someone will harass you. I can take care of myself, I don't need any of you. - Do you know what time it is? - Screw the time! I was in the Square for 4 weeks, and I never left! Even when the army took over, I didn't leave. Listen, I don't want to talk anymore! I'm not a child. Not even my mother can order me around. I promised to let you stay. I don't need any promises from you to make or break. You were beaten and dragged around. The Square and you never cried and now you're crying for this? Today is special, It's the birthday of my dear wife, the mother of our darling Amal. We are gathered around to sing for her, No, no, don't sing yet! Turn the light on. Good evening dear Mom, Happy birthday. And here's Dad kissing Mom on the mouth. A little bit of romance. Dad sits next to her. We are all very happy. No! Hush till I finish. We are all very happy, let us now sing for her. Easy! Easy on me, you savage! Amal, give your mother a kiss. Mom, here I come! Where were you? I was so worried. - Kiss your mom. - Apologize to her. They're like your brothers, they can control you. Listen Amal, you're driving us crazy. She never had any siblings to listen to. She just takes the key and leaves I went to honor my departed friends. They're not your real friends, you met in the protests. She was curious about the clashes. No, how could I know this was going to happen? I never imagined Mubarak resigning, nor the regime falling. But I saw with my own eyes people killed by hired thugs, shops' robberies... I understood a big change was happening. Tell them how I looked when I came home. They dragged her and beat her, her body was covered in bruises and scars... Sometimes at night, I can still hear their voices. "What the hell are you doing here, bitch?" They pulled out my hair with their hands. I looked like Cristiano (Ronaldo) with his spiky haircut. Since that day, this hoodie became a part of me. We have the choice between two shitty candidates. Either typhus or cholera and we have to choose the lesser evil. The Brotherhood and their rule of slavery, or Shafik and the military regime. Then everything will return as it was, as if we fought the revolution for nothing. You have pretty braids like these? We are about to elect a new president for a new Egypt, a patriot who loves Egypt and the Egyptians. Is that why you'll vote for a corrupt candidate? No, he is not corrupt. All those who were a part of Mubarak's government are corrupt. I'm voting for Chafik, and he's not corrupt. Mom, you never went to The Square. Yes, I did. - During the clashes? - Yes. You call your 15-minute visit, being there? 15 minutes? I went many times. - Did you see clashes? - No. You were never exposed to danger. You just watched it on TV... Don't interrupt me or I'll stop talking I'm answering you I asked if you were there, you clearly weren't. The media distorted your information. Listen to me - No I was there and I saw it all. Don't forget that you were in favor of Mubarak. Yes, but I never imagined the massive corruption they discovered. Even after he resigned, you supported Mubarak. Even after you saw my body covered in blood, stinking from tear gas. You still never doubted him. If he was a good person, he wouldn't have shot at his own people, he wouldn't have stolen from us or ordered the killings, he would have left us to protest in peace. It was the Minister... The Minister doesn't act without the president's approval. We shouldn't assume anything without proof. Why do you take this matter so lightly? We're not talking about chicken! These are people. People are dying I know that they pointed weapons at their chests and innocent people were killed. And still you were in favor of Mubarak. No, no, no... Swear that you did not support Mubarak. You kept telling me to stay home, that Mubarak wasn't guilty, and I told you that you had no idea what was going on. They hurt you? They threw tear gas at us in The Square. They struck us on our knees, so we wouldn't escape. It was so painful. We couldn't run anymore. There was only a small escape passage and they beat who came through it. The person in front of me was hit and died, and I tripped over him. I fainted I thought I was going to die. The angel of death was snatching souls all around, he leaned towards me, then changed his mind. They burned us with electric shocks. It caused a sharp feeling of pain. I still have scars on my back and arms. They hit me on my head, and dragged me by the hair. Now we're discussing the candidates. We need a president... What does this have to do with me? It doesn't concern me. Because I'm not able to vote, so I can't change anything. You are still too young to vote. So, I don't have a say. But if you had the opportunity to vote. In 4 years, we can talk about this. Going back to Chafik's program... I don't want to hear about Chafik! If you want to vote for him, then this conversation is over! - Is it a grudge against him? - Yes. Listen to me carefully. If you vote for a military candidate, I'm going to disown you. Renounce your mom? Because you never got what they did to me! - What about democracy? - I don't want to hear another word. And I don't want to talk anymore. Now the election runoff is held beetwen Chafik from the old regime and Morsi, the Muslim Brothers' candidate. Both candidates are facing strong opposition from all the political forces in the country. Who are you going to vote for? Many are saying that Chafik was part of the old regime. Yes he was. And you? Aboul Foutouh? He's not bad. I just want to elect anyone who can do the country any good. Someone who can fix the country. So it's back on its feet. And you, did you vote? No, I cannot vote. I just came with my mother. I like the atmosphere here. People here are from all social classes. Who did you vote for? I voted for the one I wanted Ahmad Chafik, right? If your parents want to elect the corrupt, steal their voting card. I should have stolen yours. We'll see what fate has planned for us I hope all the corrupt would die. Let's hope it won't be the Muslim Brothers. Let's hope that Chafik… He's corrupt, corrupt, corrupt. The girls. In my country, the girls, all the girls. They dream to shine like stars. They dream to wave like flags. The girls, the girls, Sometimes they are stubborn. Sometimes rebellious. And they throw away their watches. Because the ticking of the clock hurts them. And suffocates them. In my country, the girls… My girl, are you asleep? So when the election polls name a president, People have to be quiet and to submit to his power. We'll start another revolution. There won't be another revolution. It's none of your business, You're corrupt as they are. Each party creates in us a fear of the other party, but in fact there is a danger that neither one will bring stability. We must realize that we really need a third solution. Neither Morsi nor Chafik represent the people from The Square or all Egyptians... LORD, WE HAVE OBEYED OUR MASTERS AND THEY MISTREATED US. CURSE THEM AND PUNISH THEM TWICE AS MUCH. With The Muslim Brothers We're facing a dilemma. Since the reigns of Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak, they have been in prison. After the revolution, they came into power. We were wrong to let the miltary seize power after the revolution, and we fell into their trap. So, would you vote for The Brothers again? They won't remain in power for their whole term. If they stay for more 4 years, we'll all die of depression. If they impose the Sharia, would you follow it? It won't help to impose it. They want us to become similar to Saudi Arabia. It's not going to work here. Egypt's economy is based on tourism. And they want tourists to dress like us? It wouldn't work. Keep this song! Give me a kiss. You're so sweet. Today is the 7th of January. The birthday of our beloved Amal. We couldn't be happier with her. We wish her everlasting health and happiness. Don't blow your candles yet. It's bad luck to blow your candles before it's time. Loulou is Miss Amal's nickname. Look at me, dad. Put make-up on me. Don't move too much. Put make-up on me. Look at me, Amal. Amal does a lovely little dance for us. Before he died, my father told me. One day there will be a revolution in Egypt. His destiny was to die just 3 years before. I can still hear his voice saying, "Do whatever you want, and have no fear". I never understood what it meant to be alone. Until my father died. We need a light I'll go get one. Thank you. - You smoke cigarettes? - Unfortunately. - Why? - It's none of your business. I know he's with me all the time, and he's watching over me from afar. I don't know if we meet the people we love when we die. One day, out in the street. I went to the supermarket and bought a razor. I slid it over my wrist. I watched my blood dripping. I thought I was going to die. But I just stood there. As if my soul refused to leave my body. Dad told me that I was born prematurely. I was so fragile, they all thought I was going to die. I think I saw the light too early. Even before my eyes were open. When you see death up close the fear dies. You become used to it. Fights and clashes erupted in Cairo's downtown area, between The Muslim Brotherhood and protesters from Tahrir Square. Several ambulances were sent on the field in an attempt to separate the two factions... Tomboy! Hey tomboy! - Why did you spit on us? - I felt like it. Let's get out of here! He called me a tomboy. Hush, he didn't mean you. Maybe he meant you, guys? - Come on! - I can't. Come on! I could hide here, no one would notice that I'm gone. The police is coming for you. Look... because my nerves are damaged. I can't get up. Come on. In the name of God, To the glorious people of Egypt. The Armed Forces were unable to cover their ears or shut their eyes to the cry for help from the Egyptian people. The Armed Forces stepped up to do their national duty. Not their political duty. The Armed Forces have declared that they would refrain from power in the present and in the future and that they'll refrain from any political involvement. - Open your eyes. - My eyelids are stuck. It's very subtle. It looks good. Stop, stop blinking. - Be honest. - It's nice. Put some lipstick on I'll sit next to you. - Did you steal this? - It's mine I always wear it but you never notice. What's in your bag? Pants. Show me. It's a pair of pants. You like them? I told you not to wear them I'm not wearing them. Then why did you bring them? I wanted to wear them later. I don't want to see you wearing them, What's wrong with them? You wear pants yourself! You already wear revealing tops that show your body. Girls cannot wear whatever they want. And you wear your veil on and off I tried to wear it, but I found it very limiting. You told me not to wear it, because of my clothes. So why do you keep your hair short? I cut it since the police pulled it. - Is that why? - Yes, I was traumatized. When I suffocate, I cut my hair. I want to go to the football match. - No. - Why? Only you can go? Not possible! How come you go but I don't? We're different. Lots of girls go I don't care about other girls. Just about you. What does that mean? Didn't you say we were the same? Not in this case. Ok, but I will go eventually. It's dangerous and they always arrest people. So what? If you go, I'll go. We met at the Square during the clashes. During the clashes? Yes, and you forced me to take risks with you I risked my life for you. So what? I came close to dying many times I almost died because of you I almost died by your side. Remember when I fell into the cement? One day, on my way to join her during the clashes I saw Amal coming out of a hole, covered to her ears in cement, with only one shoe left. She was shouting my name. Once, a tear gas' canister landed between her feet I picked her up with one hand to move her away from the explosion. Anyway, when I fell into the cement, I felt buried, I was suffocating. Do you remember what I looked like? I didn't recognize you that day I would have preferred not to. - Is your arm hurting? - Yes, it is. - It's my scars. - You mean your little massacre here? Oh my God. You're the reason. Am I the one who cut you with a razor? Your head is a mess. You have to become an adult. What's wrong? People look at me as a woman but treat me like a child. That makes me feel alone no matter who's around me. If being a woman only means being afraid and worrying about what people think, then what is it good for? Remember when it was raining in the Square? It rained so much, you had to change your shirt I was really sick that day. You remember? I caught a cold. Whenever I think of the past I remember rain. The rain brings us good luck. I enjoy remembering those moments. They were the best days of our lives. You were nicer to me then. What? You were nicer than now. - Why can't I smoke? - Cause I said so. You're a girl and I'm a man. - Girl or boy, it's the same. - It's not! But I'm an old smoker. That's not my problem. It's bad for your health. They're my lungs, and mine are even better than yours. It's bad for girls to smoke. Your kids will be deformed. - That's not from smoking. - Yes, it is. - It's even worse for men. - No. You're so stupid. Today is Amal's first time in the sea, and she swam. Amal is swimming with her father and she looks very happy. - What's your wish? - It's a secret. Not anymore. First of all, a car. Second… Take it easy, it's only one wish. My wish is to succeed in my exams. Nothing more, it'd be enough. - Say you want to marry me. - What? Yes, I want to get married too! I'm trying not to upset you. - Are you mad at me? - I don't know. I love you, I swear. Yeah, right I swear to God I love you I'll do anything you want. - Wanna leave me? - I don't know. Tell me if you want to leave me. If you wanna leave me, go ahead. - But I'll never leave you. - Time will tell. Cut the music. Let's enjoy the party and forget about it. What have the years done? What have the years done to us? Time never separated us. And never changed us. And my longing never dissipated. Oh the years neither time nor place could change our bond. You know how much I love you I love you so. Come here, give me a hug. Why are you crying? How are you little one? Come here. Give me a kiss. You only come to visit us once a year. Have a seat, Amal. Don't you have school? I don't go there now. - You quit school? - No. I'm just preparing my exams. - What year? - Final year. - Did you fail a year? - Yes I have to repeat it. So what? Soon, you'll graduate and go to college. Your cousin wants to become a doctor. She studies day and night. You're the youngest one. I was your age when I came here. Your hair was a mess. They removed all government officials except your uncle, the Governor of Cairo. Your mother also has an important position as a judge. You still live near the Pyramids? And you still walk on the balcony railing? Why are you wearing black? Because today... What about today? Guess... Ah, it's your father's anniversary. You're so sweet to remember. Your dad died on the Prophet's birthday. Yes, March 16. Your father's grave needs some work. Next time, I want to add a piece of marble to it with dad's name I've been wanting to since he died. It was his wish to write his name on marble. His departure came suddenly, we weren't prepared. I need to visit his grave. - Need company? - Come with me. A small fox dug this hole here. - Did it reach the corpse? - No. We have to block this hole. It didn't reach your dad. I will be here, besides my dad. - That one is empty. - Of course, it's mine. Yes, this tomb is yours. Not guilty! Mubarak and his two sons are inside the cage, after he was acquitted from corruption and killing protesters in Tahrir Square during the January Revolution. This resulted in mixed reactions, at a verdict that reversed 4 years of bloodshed after the uprising that overthrew Mubarak's 30 years reign. One must be organized in life. - You're on the first page? - Yes. Really? How did your exams go? I only took French. - How was it? - Very good. Was it good? I like French. What about biology? It's not my thing. Which university do you want to go to? I'm serious. Nobody gets what they want in Egypt. What choices do I have? At the beginning, I wanted to study Pharmacy, then I thought about studying Media. - So there's no hope? - Hope for what? To join a decent college? Your name is Amal, it means hope I'm going to specialize in cotton and have a career in underwear. You'll hire famous actors for your ads. I still hope to go to a decent college. Has your father's absence influenced your studies? Yes, of course. The last time I really excelled in something, he was by my side. After he died, I never studied seriously. Today is the 8th of January 2005. Today we celebrate the birthday of Miss Amal. The most beautiful birthday. And on this happy occasion. I offer her. The most tender feelings of fatherhood and the warmest feelings of affection, sincerely from the heart. Sit down, you're being filmed, these images will remain with you forever. We're trying to add some light. Don't overdo it, her hair is too bright. Everything is being filmed, sound and image. - Dad, I want to… - Later, I'm not done! Please remember, Amal, that I'll always be by your side, at any given moment and whatever happens I want to film. No, stay seated please, over there so I can film you. I'm talking about your future. I'm doing this for you, In the future, you'll see and hear this film alone, and you'll remember these moments. God knows if I'll still be here for your next birthday. It's my identity card. Wait for it to dry. It won't be the same. It might work once it's dry. What did you do today? Nothing special. I was with my friend Nour, we went to ask about admissions, but they told us it was too early. Admission for what? I applied to Law but I don't know if I'll be accepted. What about pharmacy? My grades are not good enough. It was your dream, though. Law opens many doors, there are many possibilities. Such as what? There are courses on criminal law, courses on human rights… After the revolution, people started to become aware of human rights. Criminal law teaches us what criminals are. There's a course on how to recognize a criminal. I can work in Public Defense, as a military prosecutor like mom. I can be so much more than a lawyer. I will join the Military Academy and the police, and I will become a policewoman. After what the police did to you? Would you really join them? It's not the same. It's true that I hate them, but what happened to me has nothing to do with working for them. It's business. It's just a job. If they treated a girl like they treated you, how would you react? I'll be working in an office. Women aren't allowed on the field anyway. Is my ID dry yet? - Show me. - Wait, wait. Is your ID fixed yet? No, not yet. It won't be the same as before. Most of my friends from The Square are now in jail. If I went and protested alone, I would be arrested and nobody would care about me. People became scared and disillusioned. Most of them moved on with their lives. Some got married, others left the country. Those who remained died. My decision of joining the police might allow me to change things from the inside. At this point in my life, as an adult, I don't know anymore, if it's better to be part of the system or remain forever an outcast. People get used to the chaos in which they live in, and I'm trying to find my place. I still have this recurring dream of dad coming back to film my birthday. He asked me what my wish was my tongue froze and I couldn't think of any wish. I just wished deep inside to keep this memory and to live in that moment as long as I could stretch it. I wished to keep dreaming. Maybe I'm dreaming still. It's a beautiful day, and we have all we can ask for I just hurt myself just to justify my existence. Night-child. I'm a night-child. Remember when the music used to move us? Now we fear the dark in which we used to play. We've been there, done that, nothing can impress us anymore. Let the music cover any other sound So that no one can hear us. I was out last night, now I'm worn out. Like I'm constantly drowning, but thirsty at the same time. I step forward once, then I step back twice. I'm not crying, it's all this damn smoke that is to blame I pour a glass for two and I drink it all alone. Who's going to bother visiting my grave at the end? Come light my cigarette, and let's forget about it I hide my loneliness in the crowd, I will never feel abandoned again
