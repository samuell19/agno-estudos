He was afraid. I couldn't blame him for that. Yeah. Afraid... That's all he was. I'm off, sir. But I'll be back real soon. And know that I'm doing my best. Everything is in honor of your memory, Tenny! Oh, Chutaro. Tenka's traveling. How many ways are there to stress this? Your brother is not dead. Tenny! Let me guess, Sora already left to train for the day? Yes. Don't fret. He's just sparring with Takeda today. --Get up! --Damn it! What the hell is he? Kumou. Soramaru Kumou. Tell me. Where might Tenka be? Impossible... Orochi! Takeda! Come on! Huh. Sure is hard to have your world turn upside down. His laugh... His technique. Consider this a preview. Death will be a sweet release for Tenka. Shut up! You're not getting near my brother! Those movements... It's uncanny. But I know how to counter Tenka's moves. I can take this guy! That it? Is that all you've got? I see him! He's over there! How boring. I was expecting more. Someone worth my time. Tenka? Chutaro, you there? Orochi! Hey... You're safe at home. With us, sir! I'm... I'm okay. Takeda? He managed to escape... That man could've easily killed us both. So... why exactly are we still alive? How are you feeling? You're from the Army General Staff Office. Name's Nishino. We put you and your people in grave danger today. I apologize. Oh, no. Your arrival probably saved our lives. Thank you. That said... We're entitled to know what we're dealing with here. A Kumou is no stranger to Orochi rumor and reality. He is an Orochi carrier. A vessel? But, sir, we ourselves defeated the Orochi. Not a vessel. An Orochi carrier. While it is true that Orochi was slain, intelligence confirms that the experiments have been resumed. Orochi cells are integral to these trials, as you've seen. Carrier? Who would... do this? That's unknown. Those responsible aren't priority. You see... That man? He is one of several test subjects running free right now. My men have been ordered to capture them. We must minimize civilian casualties. We'll have to terminate them otherwise. If they're like him... I'm equipped to help you, sir. Please. It would be my honor to aid you in this! Ah, yes... Records indicate you're a former Yamainu. Thank you for your offer. But I must decline. What? Why?! Protocol demands it. My squad and I will see to this matter. Please understand. Numerous factors bear consideration here. Don't tell me... Are you suspicious of those within the ranks, sir? It pains me to admit it, but current and former brass affiliations are not above suspicion. The hell you say? No Yamainu is capable of such treachery! I'll gladly discount them... ...once your former colleagues have been located, that is. Including our brother? That man was looking for him, too... I think he wants to kill him. Where is he? He hasn't sent us letters in a few weeks. Tenka could be anywhere. But... I'll do what I can to help. I will protect him. You should trust Takeda. He is one of us and I would trust him with my life. You have no reason to suspect him or anyone else here. Believe me, I know that we can help. This is the location of the test facility. Perhaps you'll find something we didn't. We've delayed our search long enough. Thank you for this. Please know, Takeda... My intention wasn't to insult the Yamainu. I only wish to put this matter to rest. Yes, sir. Soramaru? This isn't without risk. Proceed with caution. Somebody's gotta know where the other Yamainu are... Right, Sora? Right. Heard from Takamine? We haven't been training. I haven't seen him for some time. He got in our heads. We know these people better than anyone. We have to focus. All of us. We can't let more suffer because of the Orochi. Yes. Restless, aren't you? Yeah. I understand why, of course... But I don't advise moving forward too quickly on this. Your body needs proper time to heal itself. I worry-- I have to do this, Nishiki. I'm the vessel. Please, sir. You have to kill me. I'm the only person alive that can possibly know what this guy's going through. He doesn't have to die. If anyone can stop him... ...it's me. I'm with you. I hope so. This is it. No guards are present. Something strong pried open the door. That's a little unnerving. Nishiki. If something happens, take Chutaro out of here. He's more than capable of handling himself. I can't risk him. He'll be safest with you. I wouldn't ask if I didn't trust you completely. Believe in yourself as much as I believe in you. I won't fail you. I promise. I'm counting on you. That's an intense smell. They're... all dead. Hey... look at this. What is it? An experiment log. April 3rd. Applied the serum to test subject 84. April 10th. Appetite increased. Body temp up two degrees. May 1st. Scales started to appear on their body. They weren't able to maintain composure. Fingers were amputated days later. That's awful. September 27th. Serum administered six months prior to Number 40. Still able to maintain composure. Becoming aggressive, which is causing setbacks. He is becoming stronger... Extremely dangerous. The entries end here. That was days ago. The other room had a cage for someone quite strong. There are only remnants of it now. This Number 40 broke free. Massacring all in his path. This is the guy. What is it now, Takeda? Aritomo Yamagata visited. He reported the details. Yamagata? He's a higher-up from the army. Nishino clearly suspects top brass... This might confirm his suspicions. Unfortunately. Hey. No... Sosei... Abeno? This can't be right. He wouldn't have considered it. The Yamainu were greatly opposed to the Orochi, if I'm not mistaken. Are you truly willing to participate? We existed for the soul purpose of defeating it, sir. Orochi cells are a different matter entirely. It stands to reason that they could prove beneficial. Perhaps they could even advance Japanese medicine. I will do anything to help. I'm in, sir. It is a duty I will proudly uphold. You have my word. Glad to have you. No way. Sosei saw Tenka... He knows all the hell and pain it brought down on our brother... A kid? --Let me! --No, don't! Soramaru! You're okay. It'll be all right. Please... just... ...kill me. Make it stop... Please... It... hurts. I can't... I'm so sorry... I can't. There are a lot of footprints at the back door. I think they belong to the other escapees. It's likely they're going to attack people. We have to catch them before anyone else gets hurt. Come on. Are you okay? I said come on. Why didn't you tell me, Takamine? Hey, Tora. Miss me? Kill anyone interesting or just blow off some steam by scaring the locals? They weren't worth the energy. Everyone here is so weak. I'll try not to take that personally. So much for gratitude. I'd just like to know if you're gonna be showing up bloody like the first time you came here is all. It was dumb luck someone with a medical background found you, Tora. Whatever. Keep on nagging me and see what happens. Understand? The tough guy voice. I'm in trouble. Look, despite my better judgment, I just worry. This Tenka Kumou guy isn't worth your life. Food! I just made 'em. Washing your hands wouldn't-- Eat up. I'll be right back. Don't leave me hanging! Somebody cut me down! --A trap. --Chutaro, I'm coming-- What're you doing on my land? I don't like trespassers. Make this easy for me and get to walkin'. Miss, are you responsible for this trap? Agh! Hey... Have you seen anyone suspicious around here? Anyone at all? Nope. Just you. We mean you no harm. The man we're looking for is dangerous. You should stay indoors till he's found. I can handle myself. Get gone. Ageha Shinomiya... You were charged for murder and arson, correct? You'd been sentenced to life. Take advantage of Gokumonjo's prison break last year, did you? Well... Ain't this nice? And here I thought I hadn't made an impression on the island. You weren't a prisoner. No, I was a jailer at Gokumonjo. And I think you're lying to us. You again. Tora. Tora? Tora! You'll die! Just stop this! Tora! What the hell happened to him? Leave us alone! Hey, wake up! Tora? She was a doctor before Gokumonjo. She might help him. A doctor? He's... dying. It won't be long now. Those experiments tore up his insides. He'll be lucky to live another month. Or unlucky. I don't know. I know you. You're all trying to capture Tora. Please just stop. He's not really a monster. And he deserves to die free. Just leave him alone. Leave us alone. So this is one of the more successful subjects? We received word he'd escaped... I knew he couldn't have gone too far. Commander! Takamine! Go on, Takamine. No! You can't move him now! We found what was left of the lab, Sosei... Both your names were in the logs. The man I know wouldn't do this... Tell me it isn't true. Inukai... Master Shi... All of you are together in this? Have you already forgotten the solemn oath you made to destroy the Orochi? The Yamainu are no more. What're you going to do with Tora? More experimentation, obviously... He's a great resource. How could you say that? What happened to you, Sosei? Remember Tenka's torment? Don't you remember how I suffered because of what the Orochi did? How can you be a part of it, Sosei? Tora! I got no business with you, all right? Just tell me where Tenka is. And what business do you have with him? His tissue cells were transplanted into me. Huh? He did this to me! I'm not some bastard version of Tenka Kumou. I will prove that I am the best! I'm going to eliminate him! Because I know that I'm superior! Yah! Screw this! Tora! Stop right there! Do try to stay out of our way. Commander, wait a minute! Please! Consider yourself warned. Don't interfere. Why? Why didn't you ever tell me any of this?! Am I the only Yamainu that's been left behind?! I have to know! Don't just walk away from me, Takamine! Soramaru. I'll be fine. Thanks. Takeda? I'm ready. Sosei. Is there news? Ashiya is apparently indisposed at the moment. However, he'll help if he can. His pulse is so weak. What on earth happened? Tell me! Sis, I can't... It'll be okay. I'm gonna take care of you! You'll do no such thing, woman! Why not worry about your own patients? He's my brother. I have to help him. Please! You are overstepping. Know your place. Malpractice? So it would appear. Such a tragedy. You have no one but yourself to blame. How does it feel to be a murderer? Of your own flesh and blood, no less? No one'll believe it wasn't you. It's perfect, really. Take it easy. Where am I? What do you remember? You... saved me? That's surprising? The situation wasn't much different from when we first met. It hurts so much... I think we both know I'm not a doctor anymore. Still like to think you're my patient. We'll see this through together. Try to stay put for once. Got it? Who is it this time? If I'm lucky, it's the young'uns. If I'm not... Those guys in black are seriously no joke. Tora wasn't the only one? Hold on! Targets have been neutralized. We're clear, sir. Ageha Shinomiya. You're one of the Gokumonjo escapees. You were spotted with our primary target, Test Subject Number 40. Tell us where he is. And why the hell would I do that? Our directive is to execute you on sight. Cooperate and we'll reconsider that. Yeah, I'll pass... Thanks. You bitch! Sora! What were you thinking? A Kumou defending a convicted felon? This could be considered treason. Don't think you're above consequences! I am a Kumou. Convict or not, I'm not turning a blind eye to someone being unjustly killed right in front of me. --Fire, men! --But, sir-- Fire! Fall back! Nishino! Hurry! Come this way! Think you can run? Yeah. Let's go. Are you all right? Yes. They'll want to keep this attack contained... Don't worry. My men and I can hold them off for the time being. I suggest you get going. Thank you, Nishino. You shouldn't trust him. He's military, after all. He saved us. Nishino... Yamainu are involved. That's disappointing. I know this is hard. And... I didn't want to be right about them. You know what must be done now. They have to be stopped. Them and these damn experiments. That was gunfire... It seems the others are no longer our only concern. We're fine. Focus on the mission. Are you sure you know your way around here? Let me help you! Come on. Let's see. I don't get you lot. You saved me. You want Tora gone, but you don't want the guys in black to take him out. Seems we're on the same side here. So who is he to you, anyway? Like a lover? Don't make me laugh. Definitely not. We didn't know one another before this. No one knew Tora. I don't think he ever had anyone to rely on. You do what you must to live. Even if that means stealing or killing. Tora saw the Orochi experiments as a way to get stronger. As a way to survive. I found him barely alive. His health was pretty bad after his escape. He was so torn up. I don't regret doing what I could to save him. How can you say that knowing what he's done? He's a murderer. So am I. I don't expect you to get it. But you didn't see him then. Careful now. You know chewing wouldn't be the worst-- It's good. It's so good. So warm. You didn't see those tears. You can't know what kind of life he had before. But still... I can't ignore what he's done. There are far too many lives at stake here. You can't possibly know what he's going through! --Tora is-- --But I can. All too well... I know his pain better than even you. Sora. Huh. His endurance is impressive. His stubborn will is likely what kept him alive. His resistance to the cells won't last. Keep moving. Sosei! Are you really planning to put him through more testing? Very well. Inukai, Shi. Head to the facility now. Soramaru, please. You're too wounded. Keep Chutaro safe. Right. Finally using your teeth to fight back. You don't have a chance against me, Takeda! "Even if you stand alone, don't hide your fangs." You taught me that lesson! Takamine! Don't you dare hold back! Was all that talk? Is this it? No! Your form is terrible! Tell me... Why be any part of this? I'll detain you, but I won't kill you. We're currently trying to obtain an item capable of separating the Orochi from its host. Do you honestly think death is the answer? Well? You forget yourself so easily? Pride and strength make a Kumou. Nicely done, Soramaru. This doesn't make any sense at all. You've protected this land. You couldn't let me die! You'd never treat someone this way no matter what they've done! I forget how naïve you can be. In your way of thinking... In your wielding of a sword... Do not pick one up if you don't carry the resolve to kill when necessary. Did you learn anything in all those years? Shut up. The Kumou swords aren't for ending a life. They're for protecting people! Don't you dare discount me. I am still a Yamainu! I'm not naïve. A Kumou is what I am! So annoying. I deserve answers. Why are you doing this? Who has been giving you your information on the experiment? Sosei... You sure? They're too stubborn to let this go... Others will be even less sympathetic. That's hard to imagine. We heard about the experiment from a guy with the army. His-- --Sosei! --No! So... Where is he? Number 40 is on the move. After him. Do not kill him. Sir! Oh, Abeno... Takamine... Your feigned interest in the Orochi experiments was so incredibly predictable. I'm disappointed. Why'd you shoot him? These two gentlemen will be aiding us throughout the trials, Nishino. Sir. You're aware they're Yamainu? Former. We couldn't ask for better help. Their experience with Orochi is essential. It's an honor, sir. I knew from that very moment that you were only going to screw things up for me. It's you, isn't it? You're behind all of this! Yamagata thought he was clever. I will give him credit. Employing a bunch of retired fools did force my hand. What do you want? Money? Prestige? What? Yes, all of that. But... most importantly... ...the extinction of Yamainu! Why did he have to choose you? If only Yamagata truly understood how much I have done! How much I've sacrificed for all of this! The use of Orochi cells will save our great country! Why is it so impossible for Lord Yamagata to see any of this?! I do regret involving you in this, Soramaru. I needed someone without a previous personal affiliation to kill the Yamainu squad... Oh, well. You did give the Yamainu chase... And it's clear you fought with them... It's a very reasonable assumption that not a single soul survived such an intense battle. Bastard! You planned this! I did warn you. You knew the risks. And proceeded to spite them. Fire. I'd reconsider that if I were you. I'm pretty fond of the people you're trying to kill there, bud. Tenka Kumou... ...has finally returned! Tenka! Tenny! Damnit, Sosei. Fire! Run for it! Do not let them get away! Fire freely! Appears we've lost them for now. What're you doing here, Tenny? We can catch up later. But first... You always gotta be so difficult, don't you? Hey, wake up! Tenka! Tenka? Sir! Tenka? You're him? Yeah? Wait a sec. Where's Tora? Hopefully still with Master Shi and Inukai. Probably being chased. Wait! Who's Tora? He was one of the Orochi test subjects. Tenka... I have to save him. Soramaru... You're too injured. Hey, little bro. Head out. I got things handled here. Tenka... I don't think you should be pushing yourself so hard. This is nothing... And I've got four Yamainu for backup. What's wrong? Too much for you, Takeda? Of course not. It's just... the commander... He just needs proper motivation. Wanna sit this one out? Need to borrow my wheelchair, Sosei? Shut up. Run along. Inukai and Shi need your help. Sir! Your return is quite unexpected. The funniest thing happened. This geezer at a teahouse told me something. What was it? Kiiko's working for you and she was supposed to keep me away. Don't look at me... You know how stubborn he can be. There they are! Over here! I'm moving out front! Cover me, guys! You're not a commander anymore, Tenka! --Try to keep up! --Stop arguing, you guys! Don't test me! Takeda... Don't get left behind! Sir! There's no end to them. This is getting problematic. Hey! Ashiya! I thought you couldn't make it. I couldn't ignore the looming despair in the clouds. You ready? Would you look at that? What's with these guys? How are they doing this? Commander! Where's the Commander? Just how strong is this guy? Tora! Tora. Why don't we head home? I'll whip you up some of those rice balls you love, okay? Tora! The experiment isn't over. He's all I need! I got you. You're safe. Ageha. Now he remembers my name. Your timing is terrible, Tora. I thought this would be the other way around. That I'd see you through this. I know you won't understand. But helping you has meant everything. Thank you... See ya real soon. No, wait! Please stay back. It has to be me. No, Soramaru! You can't--! Don't interfere! Tora. Tora! I am strong. No one defeats me! I'm the strongest. I'm invincible! You can't beat me! I am the strongest! You want to help him, don't you? He wants to defeat him on his own terms. I would only interfere. So I wait. So you wait? Doesn't seem like that's what you want. I don't have a choice! I follow Soramaru. His wish is to do this alone and I will honor it. I have to. I suppose so... Then again, honoring someone's wish depends on the true nature of it. Of who commands it. Nishiki? Who are you to him? His ninja? Or something more? He's still alive. Not for much longer. His eyes turned black and his blood's gotta be boiling. I am the strongest. I am strong. Yep. He's done for. Focus. Soramaru... You've got this. I understand. I see now! I am the strongest! Enough! You saved me. I'm so sorry... I remember what you told me. I didn't honor my word, I know. But I couldn't let you die, Soramaru. Please forgive me. I had to betray you to save you and I would do it again. How about that? He was pretty strong after all. It doesn't hurt anymore. I can't move. What did I really accomplish? Was any of it worth a damn? It doesn't matter. Ageha. Hey... I'm... hungry. Sora! You okay, sir? I was so worried! I'm a failure. I just couldn't save him. I couldn't. If it'd been Tenka, maybe he'd... He'd still be... Hush up. I couldn't have done better, little brother. You did him a courtesy, Sora. He got to die a human being. Fighting held back the Orochi. Focusing on his battle with you kept the beast at bay. You saved him. You done good... Real good, Brother. Excellent work, gentlemen. A decision was finally reached for Nishino. The war council will soon determine what's to be done regarding others involved. And what of the research facility, sir? It is dismantled entirely. Any cells, formulas, research, or what have you concerning the Orochi are no longer. Thank you for your cooperation. You have been a tremendous help, sir. Only wish I could've done more to stop this dreadful ordeal sooner. How are your associates and friends faring in the aftermath? Is the Kumou boy on the mend? Sora! Where are you? I could use some help over here! Okay! Be right there! "Wouldn't it be so great if everybody came over to eat?" Tenka has no consideration for those cooking. It will be a treat to have everyone under the same roof again. So... Find your answer? Nishiki? Who are you to him? His kindness overwhelms me. His upbringing was nothing like growing up Fuuma. We're so different. Are the differences too big an obstacle? Could you pack up and leave him behind? I don't think I could. I need help. I long for something like a normal life. I want to be seen as more. More than just an unfledged of the Fuuma clan. More as family. You're so cute. I'd love to help. I... Are you sure? I'd be honored. We'll find your normal. Thank you so very much! You could've done this. I'm not a great multi-tasker. Be careful carrying those. I got it, I got it! What are you doing? You haven't recovered fully! I'm fine. Moving around a little won't kill me. Man, this thing is heavy. Oh. I went through the trouble of making that dish, actually. Get that away from my seat, Sora! You're not gonna grow up to be big and strong if you don't eat, dummy. He makes his brothers do all the heavy lifting. Tenka should really help since this was his idea. Tenka? Hey. What are you doing all the way out here by yourself? Hmm. Realized I never got a good look at the view from here. I figured I'd better do it now. Why? I've got more of the world to see. I can't just stay here. What?! Yamagata seems to think I baby you. "It's time to let the boy prove himself as a man." You're impossible. What does any of that even mean, Tenka? Aren't you worried at all about the shrine? I'm leaving it in good hands. So I'm not worried. Just try not to doubt yourself. You can do this, sweet little brother. Tenny! Tenny! Well, 15th Head... Should we join them? Yeah.
