Hurry up, go, go! Quick, quick, quick! - Hurry, my skirt. - Hurry! The necklace, the necklace. Will you help me? Oh, God, what's the front? Come on, honey, We've got to go quick, quick. Oh, my dress. Can you toss me my dress? Twist the hair. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Hey. - Come on, the zipper's stuck. Can you do me up? Wait a minute. Come on! Uh, take care because my padding's... My shoes. Where are my shoes? Oh, sorry. Please, I can't bend down. Zip up. Stand still. Breathe in. - Hey. - Come on, girls. Come on. Quick, quick, quick. Get ready! My shoes. Oh, hurry. Francesco, Francesco! Quick, quick! Come, come, come, come! Give them to Carter... the plain-looking one over there. Over there! It's lucky he doesn't have a big ego. So what do you think? I think he might have lost his touch. Or his mind. Do you think he's a good guy? - Are you kidding? - No, I mean, deep down. It would have to be very, very deep. I mean, he's made beautiful things. There must be some good in him. Don't be fooled by that. Have you got a thing for him? Please, don't be ridiculous. Of course not. Good. It's a shame your interview with him is tomorrow. They hate his collection. Hello, my beauties! Oh, thank you. Thank you. I love you. I love you all. You are just delicious, all of you. In honor of today's collection, Salvitore would like to invite you all to an evening of wine song and cheese. Whoo! Carol, I need to speak with you. You were a petal today. A little flower opening for me. - Kelly! - Oh! Oh... Okay, I'm sorry. Look at this way, at least you'll have something to talk about tomorrow. Yeah, hi, I'm Kelly Carter. I'm the one who dumped your dresses all over the ground yesterday, remember me? Okay, you're right. Yeah, maybe I should have let it hit him. Good luck tomorrow. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. There are those who believe today's collection to be... genius. Oh, my God! We didn't know you were here. I cleaned the apartment. - Hmm? - Did you? - Mm. - What do you want, a medal? The rent's due on Monday. Don't be late. Don't you get embarrassed sometimes that she lives with us? Wow. Darling... I'm sorry, darling. I'm... just too busy for a long-term relationship. But we just met yesterday. Exactly. - You did this? - Yes. - Magnificent. - Thank you. - Champagne? - Oh, please. - Dance? - I'd love to. How many children would you like? Well, two to start with, three, if we're still getting along. I'm really sick. I'm sick. I'm late. Please excuse me could you help me? Oh, oh, sir, I'm trying to get to the... Could you help me? I'm... Be tough. Be assertive, yet charming. Don't be taken advantage of. Oh, madam, please, I would like to go to the... no, here, can I... Oh... God. Oh, ma'am, excuse me. I'm lost. Can you tell me how to go to... Oh, sir, please can I... can... can you tell me how... Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Oh, excuse me. excuse me, sir. Oh, no. Oh, no, please. Excuse me. Excuse me, can you help me? I think I'm lost. Excuse me. Do you need some help? Thank you. I'm lost. I need to get to the Ile Saint-Louis. - Okay. - You know I was in Missouri a week before I realized I was supposed to be in Paris. Your map's upside down. Okay, okay, you're here, what you have to go is you want to go down here and you want to cross over this bridge there and then you continue and that's it, okay? - Thank you so much. - All right, you're welcome. Where are we now exactly? - There. - Course I am, thank you. I'm really in a hurry. I got to go. Oh, I understand. Nice to speak to you. - You too. - Thank you again. Uh, ma'am! Ma'am, you're going in the wrong direction. You want to go this way. Oh, one wonders how I get anywhere. Thank you. Oh, God! Are you all right? Yes, thank you. That might have been painful. - Oh, I don't know how to thank you. - It's okay. Be careful how you go. You're sure you're all right? - Fine. - Okay. You are very kind, you know that? Oh, no. Oh, God. I wish there was some way I could thank you. Hi, I'm Kelly Carter. I'm late for my appointment with Señor Salvitore. That's my name there. - You're late. - I know. - Kelly Carter. - I'm sorry. Take a seat over there. Uh, Francesco, we have the press clippings and reviews. Rene, you've come to congratulate me. The reviews, yes, yes. Read them to me. I want everyone to savor this moment. As a token for your small but important contribution to the success of the collection, I will be giving each Salvitore employee an autographed photo of myself. Read them to me. Read them to me. - Carter, you're late. - I know. I'm sorry. I don't know if he'll have time to see you now. You can wait if you want to. He's in an important business meeting discussing yesterday's success. Fraud?! She called me a fraud? Do you believe this? Where's my aspirin? This tasteless illiterate of a critic is never allowed to see my collection again. - Is that understood? But, Francesco, you have already banned that one. Then ban her again. She hated my collection. Everyone hates your collection. Everyone hates the collection? Well, yes, but she criticized my darling Carol, the very image of Salvitore. Everyone says the image of Salvitore is stale. Stale? - Ridiculous. - Ridiculous. - Ridiculous. - Ridiculous. Sales are down. Sales are down? Way down. We need to change our entire image. Cancel everything. I want the heads of departments and the assistants in the studio immediately. Make sure Carol is there. Thank you very much. Thank you. Grego, This is a very nice outfit. You're wonderful, and I just want to thank you for all your hard work. Have that man fired immediately. I'm sorry. What do you do for me? Yes, I see. There'll no hats in the next collection. My condolences to your family. Carol, my beauty. Your face is the exact image of my soul. I want a new look for Salvitore. a new image, a new face. Scour the city, bring me every beautiful girl you can find. I want big ones, fat ones, small ones, tall ones, did I say fat ones? No fat ones. Do what you must, but find me that face. There's no point. He won't be able to see you. - Well, I don't mind waiting. - He's left for the day. Mimi! I need you! You missed your appointment. We're just too busy. I'm afraid it's impossible. - I really don't mind... - Impossible! waiting. Oh, Carter? We need dresses for tomorrow, If you're interested, of course. Oh... poor little thing. Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Come here. Excuse me, oh, excuse me, can you tell me, how can I get from down here to up there? Oh, hello. It's you. Um, you go under the bridge and up the stairs there. What's this? I've just told you how to get there. Oh, thank you. I know. Well, the reason you get lost is you don't listen. Oh, I'm sure you're right. What do you do? Are you a painter? No. You draw? What do you draw? Shoes. Shoes? How interesting. I've never met anybody who draws shoes. You must have a very good soul. Sole, get it? - It was a joke. - Oh. Oh, can I look? Oh! These are beautiful. Gorgeous. You did this? Oh, you're remarkable. Oh, be careful. - Did you make these? - Yeah, they're broken. Oh, they don't seem broken. Oh, can I try them on? - Well... - Oh, they look like they're my size. Oh, they're perfect. Oh, don't I look beautiful in them? Oh, you're very talented. I bet you're famous. Oh, I've probably insulted you not knowing who you are. No. You have plenty of company. Well, as long as know who you are. That's all that matters. Uncle Clarence used to tell me that. Oh, I think it was him. I want to thank you again for helping me find my way. You're a very nice person, very nice. Under the bridge and up the stairs. When you're down here, it's always hard to find your way up. Under the bridge and up the stairs. Under the bridge and up the stairs. Under the bridge and up the stairs. These shoes were broken. Oh, you know, another thing uncle Clarence used to say, with wings on your feet, dreams can come true. Oh, I think it was him. Hi, Kelly, how is it going? - Hungry? - We saved some food for you. Let me clear this up. - How was your day? - Did you meet Salvitore? - No. - No?! I thought you said she had a meeting with Salvitore? She told me she did. You told me you did. I did, but it didn't happen. - You told me she could help us. - Help you with what? - Nothing. - Meet Salvitore. He's looking for a new model to represent his house, to be his new image. I should have known. Carter, the rent's due on Monday, okay? I think she should be it, don't you? These shoes were broken. So how was it yesterday, huh? So I waited for him all day. He didn't have time. - You're a poodle. - I'm not a poodle. Come on, concentrate. You got to get his attention. - You're in my way. - Sorry. Oh, sorry. You're handling this all wrong. You got to be more aggressive. You got to be tougher. Stop talking! You're all set. Excuse me, I just want you to know, I did the best I could. You've got to take charge of your life. Stop taking shit. Give some back! That woman's got no chin. You notice that? We'll begin. Next! No! No! No! No! No! You must be kidding. What are you looking for? Your chin, you seem to have lost it. No soul. Tedious. Shallow! Get them out, all of them! Okay, girls, get out, get out, come on. I'm finished. I feel nothing. I'm attracted to nothing. There's no beauty. There's no magic. The world is black! You're in the same room with him. You've got to talk to him. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid? What are you, insane? The guy has just humiliated a huge portion of the most beautiful women in Paris. The guy is a horror show. Don't be afraid? Don't be ridiculous. Go on. Shut up! The guy's a monster. I'm a monster. You see? Even he thinks so. Nothing moves me, nothing touches me. They all look alike. plastic, forced, the image of Salvitore must be life! You've got to get him before he goes. - Information. - No! Veronique, come! Go on! No. No! I have lost my inspiration. I feel nothing. I'm moved by nothing. That is my tragedy. If I could find something beautiful that moved me, it would be a miracle, I think. I want something more than pretty. I want someone who's full of life, full of joy, someone who's truthful and challenging and not... this. I won't find it here. Mnh-mnh. Perhaps I won't find it at all. - Did you do it? - No. Do it right now. Señor Salvitore, I'm Kelly Carter. I'm very happy for you. Great job. You choked. You're a girl. He's a man. You had the natural advantage. You need to do something to make yourself a little less invisible. I am going to help you with this. - I don't need any help. - I'll forget you said that. First thing's first... looks count. You need a new one. You look like a housewife. You're an artist. You got to make an effort to live up to people's expectations. I don't know, you look normal. Rule two, you're exactly what other people think you are. It's an existential thought, I know. If you think you're ordinary, you're ordinary. If you think you're special, then you're special. We are going to rebuild your self-confidence. That doesn't look like tough. That looks like you sat on something. Watch me. Watch me. Try sultry again. Now that looks like you have something in your eye. I can't do this. This is ridiculous. - I can't do this. - Of course, you can. - No, I can't! I can't, okay? - You can. The idea is just to get other people to see you in a certain way. It's no different than clothes. It's a matter of confidence. Rule three... it's all a game. I'll teach you a new one. This is... I've got no plan for this evening so why don't you come over and talk to me? Are you serious? Is there anyone sitting here? - No. - Thank you. I don't know. Just leave me alone. Kelly, I thought you did very well, honestly. - Come on! - It was a stupid idea in the first place. I can't believe I went along with it. The only way I can look is the way I look. And I don't need men to make me feel good about myself, okay? I feel fine about myself as I am except for the fact that these pants are choking the life out of me. I've never been happier. Nobody could be happy like that. Francesco. Francesco? Francesco? Francesco? - Francesco. - Francesco. I... I've lost my inspiration. I can't find a new image for the house of Salvitore. Everything seems artificial. I'm a fraud. And I've let you down. I'm sorry. We should close the house of Salvitore. It is nothing but a house of cards. Only a miracle can save me now. Excuse me, excuse me, when do you open? - What? - This is Versailles, isn't it? Stupid woman. - Go away. - I'm here, aren't I? Your map is upside down. Oh. Stupid woman. Wow. This is some kind of a house. Ohh! You could throw a big, big, big party here, couldn't you? I've got a good idea where I am now. Thank you for your help. Oh, you know, when you're looking for something, it can be staring you in the face, and you sometimes have to find different ways of seeing it. Thank you for your advice. Oh, it was good of you to answer the door the second time. - Hmm? - I usually only knock once. Oh. Rene, Mimi, come quick! I have an idea. Sometimes it can be right in your face. And you need to see a different way of looking at it, you see. Because it's a party, they won't know they're being watched. And when they least expect it, I'll see it... animated and alive. It is a brilliant conceit. Invite everyone. - Did you get one? - Yes! Did you get one? Of course she didn't. Oh... it's... wonderful. You look... oh, you look wonderful. Oh, yes, it's... oh... Oh, honestly. Perfect. Get out of the bathroom. You've been in there an hour! It's not fair! You don't have a chance anyway. So what are you worried about? Oh, ow! You bitch! Get out of there, you bitch! Ah! Get out of there, you bitch! Get ou-ou-ou-ou-t! Get out of there! Bitch, bitch, get out of there! I've got to get out of here. Why don't you be my date tonight? We'll crash this party together. No, I can't. No, I don't have anything to wear anyway. Look, just your size. Oh, it's Salvitore. - What? - I can't wear that. It's stolen. It's borrowed. No, I... I can't. Come on. Who knows, maybe you can get Salvitore's attention, huh? Oh, yeah, sure. You do have a little thing for him. No, I... no, I... I don't have a little thing for him. A big thing. If nothing else, you can prove to yourself that you're not scared of him. Scared? I am not scared of him, okay? Kelly, you're a nice girl. It's too bad you won't let anything nice happen to you. It's okay for a girl to have some fun, huh? - You look terrible. - You think you're so great. Stuff it, Domino. Oh, my God. Wait! Wait, taxi! Wait for me! Taxi! Wait! Oh, excuse... oh, it's you, hi. I was just thinking about you. - You're going out tonight? - No. That is just a super dress. Super! Oh, you're going to look so lovely in it. And it will go perfectly with your shoes. Those shoes are special. Thanks. So how are you? How nice of you to ask. I'm... busy but happy. What is it? Well, I'll leave you to it. I'm sure you have to get ready. Needs work. It's gonna take a miracle. - Excuse me. - Jean Marc? Thank you. Guess this is as good as it gets. You need a taxi back? You can order it now. - Yes, please. - I'll be here at midnight. I've seen enough. I'm going to bed. Thank you very much. You didn't take anything? - No, thank you. - Why? No! Excuse me. Yeah? What's wrong? Are you mad at me? Was I before? Was I your dresser or something? - Who are you? - What do you mean who am I? I feel like everyone is staring at me. Yeah, they are. - Do you think they know? - Know what? That we don't belong here. I belong here. Who are you? What do you mean, who am I? Will you stop playing this game? You're making me nervous. Where did you get that dress? Would you cut it out? You know very well you gave it to me. Kelly? Yeah, who do you think? You don't look like you. What? You don't look anything like you. Belle. Rene, this is my creation. Oh, well, I can explain. - Who are you? - No, no, no! I prefer for the moment that she remain a mystery. Okay, if you want. You will be whoever our imagination wishes you to be. Why is it that we have not met? Well, actually... I don't know. You are a miracle. - I am? - Magnificent. Thank you. Champagne? - Please. - Dance? I'd love to. Yeah, but... did you see how vain she is? Prepare everything. Are you new to Paris? Apparently. I mean, yes, I am. I am flattered that you should wear my dress. The shoes, are they Italian? Oh, no, they're Carter. Kelly Carter. She's a friend of mine. I too would like to be a friend of yours. Okay, If that's what you want. Will you work for Salvitore? That's what friends are for. Oh. You don't know how happy you've made me. Tonight, I will change your life. Well, that's very nice of you. Ladies and gentlemen, The face of the future! The image of Salvitore! Holy shit. They've taken you to their hearts as I have. I will make you an object of desire, such a beautiful creature, pure innocence. We begin at once. I just need some personal information. - Oh, not now, Mimi. - Right, well, it'll only take a couple of minutes. You just read it, fill out the form... - We would like to be alone. - Yes, certainly. - So as I told you... - Please! Yes, just five minutes, just to fill out the form, just five minutes, it won't take any longer. Do you believe in love at first sight? - Uh, not normally. - Sleep with me. - What? - I must have you completely. You wouldn't be satisfied with just a part of me? - I love you. - You don't waste any time. I waste nothing. I want to be one with you. One's the loneliest number. Stay here with me tonight. Why do you resist? Prudence. Prudence. - Um, what time is it? - Midnight. Midnight? I've got to go. - I've got a taxi waiting. - Why? The night is young. Oh, that may be, but you know how it is. I'll turn into a pumpkin, beauty sleep and all that. Um, you've been ever so kind. Thank you very much. Um, you have a lovely home. Good night. We will be together, Prudence. I'm only half a man without you. Good night, my apparition, my paradigm of beauty. - Good night. - Gosh. This is too weird. Temperamental little tart. Just a moment! Just a moment! Did you fill out the form? Wait, wait! - My shoe! - Don't worry. He'll get it back to you. - Nice time? - Unbelievable. Who was she? - Find Kelly Carter. - Her dresser? Oh, my God! Is Kelly Carter here? I need to speak with Kelly Carter. - Ah! - I'm sorry. I'm not looking my best right now, Francesco, but if you give me a couple of hours, I'm sure... Señor Salvitore, I'm sorry I had to leave early last night. - Where is she? - Who? - Prudence. - Who? - Are you Kelly Carter, the shoemaker? - Uh-huh. Where can I find your friend Prudence? Can I get you some coffee? Oh, good idea. Her dress! She must be here. Where is she? I have no idea. She was here, she stayed over, and she left... early this morning, very early thi... She didn't say goodbye. Well, where can I find her? I wish I knew. I can try and get a message to her. Did you do these? Uh, yes. Do you like them? I must find her. Do you understand? Yeah, more than you know. Did you see the way he looked at me? I think he really liked me. I do. Unbelievable. Kelly, Kelly the new image of Salvitore. - You're gonna be rich and famous. - Shh. Oh, oh... oh, my God, what happened? Oh, I get it. It was a joke, right. No, it wasn't a joke, okay? How did you do it? You know, I don't know. And what's worse is I don't know how I undid it. Well, whatever you did, you'd better do it again. - Maybe it was a dream. - It wasn't a dream. Do you realize what's riding on this? Do you realize how much money's at stake? - I don't care about the money. - You don't care about the... You don't care about the money? Are you crazy? You will be world-famous. - I don't think you understand. - I don't think you understand. All I want to do is design shoes. When you look like you looked last night, you can do and be anything you want, even design shoes. Do you really think so? I know. Believe me. If he can have who you were last night, he will do anything for who you are today. Do you know where you lost it? Where I lost what? Your looks. When I lose something, I try to retrace my steps. Kelly, I'm gonna help you with this. You know, I'd done my hair, I'd done my makeup, I put on my dress, I remember looking in the mirror, and I was still me. There's got to be something else. Yeah, I guess I'm just destined to be me. That's okay, it's not so bad. I've been me all my life. And I'm used to it. Want something to drink? Sorry. What is it? What? It... It worked. - Oh, my. - What did you do? I opened the refrigerator. Opening the refrigerator, usually makes you ugly. Close it. Look at me. It's not the refrigerator. What else? Um, I was sitting over there, right? Okay, I'm over here. I was sitting down, I get up, I walk over here. Look at me. No. Um, oh, I remember. I put my shoe on. Sit down, sit down. Put it on. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes? It's you. Thank God, I thought I'd lost you. I am already at work on my new collection... Prudence by Salvitore. I am covering parts of the body that haven't been covered in years. I am alive again. I'm touched by genius. We need to talk business. Okay, the money's not the problem. There are a couple of things we want you to look after... namely, Prudence wants her own dresser and her personal assistant. Fine. Who do you want? Veronique. We can negotiate my fee, signing bonus, - and holiday pay later. - Mm-hmm. Oh, and there's one more thing. There is one more thing. - I want my own designer for my shoes. Who? - Kelly Carter. - Who? She's not a designer. She's not a designer. She is too. She's a great graduate of the Paris institute. A piece of paper doesn't make you a designer. She has no reputation. It's not possible. It's not going to be possible. Have you seen her work? We can't let an amateur work with a master. It wouldn't be good for either of them. I'm afraid we can't say yes to this. They can't say yes to this. We'll pass on this one if we can put aside a little extra money for the dresser. Where... where are you going? Home. - We are not done. - Oh, yes, we are. Thank you very much for your offer, but I'm not interested. Prudence, Prudence... I want to make this work. Now if your friend is good, she can design your shoes. but if she's bad, this I can offer. This I can accept. - Sleep with me tonight. - This I can't. Carter! Kelly Carter. Look at her. She's so ordinary. Hi. Look, I feel so stupid just standing here. Hi, I'm Kelly Carter. I'm thrilled to have a chance to work with you. So what are you working on? You were a dresser, I believe, in my last collection. That's right. I'm sorry it wasn't more successful. I'll try to do better this time. I'm working on a coat. Mm. You know, I... I like the idea. It's similar to what you did last year, but better. I love the idea of a coatdress, but, may I? Um... If you had a great winter shoe. It would really finish the look, Something like this. I think it would work. What do you think? How can I concentrate with everyone in the room? Get out, all of you! Jesus. Carter. Mimi, close the door. Come here. Show me. Well, this one... - I don't need any explanations. Thank you. - Okay. Can I ask you something? How good of friends are you with Prudence? Quite good. You could say we're like sisters. Did she... does she... You are very good. Did she mention me at all? If it's bad. Don't tell me. Well, of course, she mentioned you. Very nice choice of color. Were they good mentions or bad mentions? You're very good with the fabrics. If it's bad, don't tell me. Well, I'd say, on the whole, good. Good? Good. If you talk to Prudence again, you can tell her that I think she is very attractive. I think she got that. And that I would like to get to know her better. Really? I'm not happy with that color. What do you think? I think you're right not to be happy. You don't lie, do you? That's good. Get to work. You've got a job. I do? Oh, thank you. That's great. Thank you. Mimi! I like the shoes-with-the-coat idea. - Work on it. - Okay. Yes, Francesco? I'll show her out. Show her to the studio. Get her a table. See this one? It seems to me that this is that old thing, and we don't need any more at all, right? You know, this is like total Norma Kamali last year, right? So what I... So this could be... Carter? No! That's good. What time is it? - 8:00. - Thank you very much. Good. That's not so bad. Kelly. I've been trying to find you. We've got a problem. - What is it? - Prudence has a fitting today. Salvitore called me an hour ago. - When is it? - Now. I brought these. Yes? We are ready. Shh! Lovely. Thank you. - Fantastic! - Sublime! - Marvelous! - Marvelous! Where's Kelly? I'll get her. Is everything ready for the session... photographers, art direction? - Of course. - It's all ready. - You called me, Francesco? - Yes. Did you see the fitting? Yeah, I saw bits of it. And? The truth? Mm-hmm. Really? Yes. I think it's boring. I think it's pretentious. I think it's two years old, and I don't think it has anything to do with what I thought this collection was supposed to be about. The way they've cut the fabric, I mean, you can't move. Basically... I think it stinks. You're right. Did Prudence tell you you can't move? Yeah, she sure did. Will you tell her that she can address me directly from now on? Are you gonna be on time for the fitting? Of course. Good. I'm gonna want you right by my side. Gonna be there. Mimi, throw it out! Where's Prudence? Prudence! I don't know what you're complaining about. We're created a Frankenstein. Wrong story. Besides, how did it get to be "we"? Do you mind cleaning up your mess when you're done? Yeah, you never know when Francesco might drop in. So what are we gonna do? I am going to sit back and enjoy it. Where are you and Francesco going tonight? - Dinner. - And then? - I don't know, home. - Whose home, his? You know what that means. It doesn't mean anything. I suppose at the crucial moment, you could just kick your shoes off. That would make him wilt. Revolutionize birth control. You know, I don't think you're very funny. I'll handle tonight. What are we gonna do bout that shoot? We'll get through it. Yeah, how am I gonna be at two places at once? Oh! Nice to see you. Francesco? Can I get you something? I'm a good friend of Kelly's. Are you Kelly's roommates? Yes. Oh, she's so sweet, my favorite. Much more than, uh... Well, Kelly was wondering if you mind giving the place a good clean. Francesco will be here in a moment. Francesco's coming? Oh, yes, and and she was wondering, would you mind terribly if she was a little late on the rent this month? Oh, we don't worry about things like that. We're like sisters. Of course you are. Oh, well, that must be Francesco. Oh, my God. - Love to stay and chat. - But got to go. Is he coming in? What am I going to do about my hair? Oh, don't change anything. You're... beautiful. So I guess this means we're not going out for Chinese? Are you trying to impress me? Yes. Well, it worked. - Oh! - You are the most beautiful creature. I wish you wouldn't talk to me like that. I mean, you talk to me as if I'm not a human being. No one ever talks to me like that. It just makes me feel funny. That makes me feel funny too. Oh, my God! I know what... I know what you're expecting. I'm not expecting anything. Sure. I'll wait. You'll wait? I want to wait. Tell the chauffeur to get the car ready. I think it's better if we wait. After all, we don't want to make any mistakes. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Now really? I don't know if he was doing a number on me or what. I'll wait? Maybe he didn't feel well. Maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him. No, he seemed fine. You know, no sicker than usual. You know, he was charming. - Uh-huh? - Well, he was. Are we ready? - Just about. - Well, is Prudence here? - Just about. - Not... not quite. Are you feeling okay? Yes. Have you spoken to Prudence today? - Yes. - No. - Yes. ♪- No. - No. - No. You know I'm very fond of her. She's been my inspiration. She's been your inspiration! What about me?! You're obviously not in touch with yourself. Oh, that's nice. Keep turning. Oh, beautiful. Get Carter. Prudence, you are a spider, spinning... spinning... and spinning. One more but change the this time. I can't find her. - Kelly. - Carter! Just check the make-up. This backdrop is Edward Hop. - Yes, right. It's not... - But I don't want Edward Hop. I recognize that the quality of the painting... Which word didn't you understand? - I don't... - Francesco. - I would like you to watch. - I was. Where were you? I was just getting the next setup ready. What do you think about the clothes? Truthfully. I think they're wonderful. You do? Mm-mm, I do. Thank you. Prudence! Cut it! Um, she's resting okay? And you should just give her... give her a few minutes. - Can you just give her a few minutes? - What? - Let her rest, okay? - Okay, alright. - Just give me a minute, all right? - One minute. Go. Hello? - Where's Kelly? - She just disappeared for a second. Shh. - Snow! - Yeah! Snow! - So? - No snow, you know? No snow! - How is she? - She'll be ready in a second. Good, I want to see her fully dressed before we go. - Of course. - I haven't seen the shoes. - The... the shoes? - Yes, the shoes. The shoes that Kelly designed to go with the coat. I haven't seen Prudence in them. I want to see that before we go. Yeah. We've got a huge problem. What kind of shoes did Prudence intend to wear with this outfit? Oh, my God. One of you two has got to go. And I say we get rid of Kelly. What? Prudence earns more money. Salvitore loves her. She gets noticed everywhere she goes. - She could be important to our careers. - Our careers? I think it is important we are realistic about this decision. I can't believe you're saying this. Prudence? What I suggest is that you go out there in your evening shoes and tell Francesco that the shoes are a real disaster and that you have fired Kelly. Forget it! You want Salvitore, you get him as Prudence. You want a big career, you get it as Prudence. What does Kelly have to offer? Prudence! - A lot. - We're waiting. Okay, let's let him decide. Oh... oh, please. Men always make the wrong decision. She what? She won't wear the shoes. She refuses. You're gonna have to decide. Either Prudence goes or I go. - You can't have us both. - Why not? Listen to me. Either she goes or I go. It is very, very expensive to arrange all this. I'm sorry to do this to you, but you have to decide. - I have to make a choice? - Yes. - Now? - Yes. Good decision. Can I have a word with you over here for a minute? What is this shit, huh? I work with you. I give you support, encouragement. I hold your hand, and now you're telling me to move on? I've never lied to you, Francesco. But you're due for a few home truths. I care about you, I really do, but you don't care about me because you don't care about people. All you care about are appearances, looks, surface. All this, your whole world is images. You're surrounded by people who lie to you, who believe the same shit that you do, but I know you know the difference, and I know you have a heart. But you're just too afraid to use it. And that's what makes you a fraud, not as a designer but as a human being. Do you understand? Adios. - Give me the shoes. - I don't... Don't say a word. - Where's Kelly? - Where's Carter? She's gone, real upset. Don't worry, I'll make sure everything is okay. - She's gone? - Yeah. - Good, she was a waste of time. - She's gone. Oh, good lord, please take those shoes off. No. I can't wear these. They're horrible. I want you to wear those shoes. They're a disaster. I won't wear them. - You won't wear them? - No. - You won't wear them? - No. Prudence is right. Carter's an amateur. Designers like her are two a penny. Another opinion from you and you'll be selling rags in the flea markets. These shoes are a reflection of effort, of style and of substance. She's a fine designer and an inspiration to me. You're lucky to have met her. Prudence, there's a very important rule you may have forgotten. Looks fade. And yours have faded like a bad sunset. - Oh, thank you. - Yes. Where can I find Kelly? Down by the river. There is a little place she goes, down by the river. Kelly! Kelly! Excuse me. I'm leaving now. And I just wanted to thank you for all your help. You've been ever so kind. Stay that way. Kelly! Kelly! How do I get from here to Budapest? Come back. Work for me. Why should I? Because I need you. You're very talented. You've helped me. I care about you. I don't want to lose you. There's something about you... that's magical. You say all the right things.
