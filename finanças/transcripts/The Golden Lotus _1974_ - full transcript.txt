It takes time to make them How can I hurry? Qiuju Stupid maid The lady is going to break your leg The master is hungry How long does it take? Alright That's enough...

It must be that bitch who told lies about me You should ask around first instead of beating me without reason You're trying to talk your way out? Didn't you give this to him? Where did you get this from? I'm asking you The other day when I was working in the garden I realised it's loss after I returned to my room Guess I must have dropped it in the garden I went back to look for it Couldn't find it anywhere How come it's with you now? So you didn't give it to him? Is this your proof? Is this what you've got against me? Think about it How old is that boy!

Tell me Has she been sleeping with Qintong? You've scolded and beaten her No one dares to challenge you when you insist According to you... They didn't? Who said they did?

This is a bell From Burma What is it for? That's him Hua Zixu's hiding jewelery and money in his house He has seized all of our family property Make an arrest... What are you doing? Come along to the magistracy Sir... help me to make a statement Please help me, Mr. Ximen What's the matter? What the hell's going on? The brothers of the Hua family... are fighting for the inheritance They are suing Hua Zixu They also claim that you're holding... most of the property Zixu doesn't know about this Why would they know about it? Are they telling the truth? When the old man died... He knew his nephews were all useless That's why he entrusted me to take care... of most of the Estate and wealth That's it We better think of something Otherwise, if the officials find out Then you'll be in trouble How about... We move the jewels to your house Then we'll hide them up first As for Zixu's case, we still... need your help to put in a good word for him Okay, let it be this way Actually, this is Ximen Qing's wicked plan He worked with Hua Ziyou, Hua Ziguang and Hua Zihua to fight with Hua Zixu On the other hand he pretends to help Hua Zixu And since, Ximen Qing knows that after their uncle's death he left a lot of jewelery behind. And as the nephews are useless, that's why... he left the inheritance in Li Pinger's hand Ximen slept with Li Pinger and schemed her money And he pretends to help with the Hua Zixu's case... from where he got a lot of money Zixu is ordered by the court... to sell his property; And then split among the four cousins. Ximen Qing used part of Li Pinger's money... to buy Hua Zixu's house After the case Hua Zixu has absolutely nothing left All the treasures, property, whatsoever, it's all blown He borrows money from many And he later buys a house Soon thereafter, being distraught... he died because of typhoid fever Li Pinger assumed that she could marry... Ximen Qing after the death of her husband Who knew Ximen would acquire a new love; The new favorite... is Wu Yiner, Hua Zixu's former mistress He had forgotten about Li Pinger (Hua Family Funeral Rites) Lady So? Have you seen Mr. Ximen? I waited for a long time No sight of him I heard from his employees that... Mr. Ximen hasn't been back home for a few days Could he have gone on a trip? Well? No He's at Wu Yiner's place Lady Lady... Li Pinger misses Ximen Qing She falls sick and fantasizes of their love-making every night Doctor Jiang Zhushan takes the opportunity Under the pretext of curing Li Pinger... He pleases her with sweet talks It didn't take long... (Dr Jiang Residence) For him to move into Li Pinger's house And he opens up a clinic there Congratulations! (miraculous cure) Despite being a doctor himself... He couldn't treat his own problem He got kicked off the bed soon Get out You useless man You got me all worked up And then you couldn't do it Get out Sorry, I... You see, I can't during the day Give me a break! You couldn't that night either You're nothing... compared to Ximen Qing Please don't compare him... with that piece of shit Out you go Yes Is the doctor in? Who is it? Come in Taking a nap? Have a seat... Please sit down You two... We're here to get some medicine Yeah? What kind? Dog's lung, got any? Dog's lung? You must be kidding Of course not No? What about wolf's heart? Wolf's heart? You must be teasing me You think this is a joke? Man, we are serious You've got those inside you What are you talking about? I don't know you both Bullshit That's why I said you aren't a human Don't you know me? I'm Lu Hua Which Lu Hua you talkin' about? Where have we met before? Stop pretending When you borrowed money from me You were really polite And now it's time to pay back your debt Pardon me? Where? You asshole Bullshit See this? It's a receipt for borrowed money This is your foot print Foot print? - Guard - Yes sir See if there's a match Yes Lord Master Just as you had predicted After Jiang Zhushan got out of prison He got the boot from Li Pinger Li Pinger told me that she still hopes to marry you Yeah, she's a lot thinner now If you agree to the marriage I need to get back to her Cheap cow Alright, go tell her There won't be any gifts from me Just pick a date Would there be some drinks or lively banquet? A banquet, huh? After she marries me I'll show her my colors I'm staying here tonight It's your wedding night, master Wedding night? Who cares? Master, come here The 6th lady has hung herself Hurry Hurry, you all be quick Faster... The 6th lady has hung herself Hurry up... 6th lady... Please wake up Awoken, she's up... What are you doing? What do she think I am? Coming to my house to kill herself Today... should be a happy day of her But you didn't go to her. You're wrong! None of your business 6th lady... Get the hell out. Didn't ya hear? What are you doing? Get the hell out, all of you Come on, let's go We'll leave her with you Master No matter what She was once your favorite Please spare the lady None of your business, get out Yes master You slut If you did feel guilty... Then why you tried to hang yourself at my house? Since you were married to that asshole You might as well have stuck with that Why did you again come to my house for? Get down here Get down C'mon, kneel You married him You helped him financially But why did you tell him that I took your money? Who? Who said that? You didn't say it? Of course not I wanted to marry you All I wish for is your love Money is nothing to me You want to marry me? That sounds nice indeed! Then why did you marry Jiang Zhushan? You weren't there for me I was crazy about you I missed you all the time I forever fantasized about you so much ...that eventually I fell sick Then Jiang Zhushan showed up I was totally confused That was what happened So you told him that I had taken your money, is it? No God, If I did... I may rot to death, okay Actually it's not a big deal To tell you truth I sent Lu Hua and Zhang Sheng to him He got cornered If I so desired... You too would have ended up in court I knew you were behind it If you pity me... then get me to a deserted place and just kill me there Let me ask you How was I compared to Jiang Zhushan? He's nothing compared to you You're like heaven and he's hell! You're the only man for me After we have met... I couldn't stop thinking about you Really? Good guys never live long Disasters last for centuries Honestly! At times God prefers not to see I mean, take Ximen Qing for instance; If it wasn't for his relatives who introduced him to the grand tutor Cai And kept showering expensive gifts Isn't that why he got promoted? Wu Zhi and Hua Zixu were useless when they were alive And now they're equally useless ghosts That's hard to tell Maybe the time hasn't come yet Sooner or later Karma would tell For what? You see, there's something besides promotion After he got married to Li Pinger She's given birth to a son Come... My son Let me kiss you Only seven months since they got married And she has a son! Who knows... maybe the child isn't Ximen's I think, it's probably Jiang Zhushan's kid Enough of this nonsense talk Don't let him hear you Or you'll be in trouble As if I care! Considering the time frame... Actually I think the kid is probably Hua Zixu's Is it the new wet nurse? She happens to be the wife of Zhang Si Her husband left for the army... when their son was merely a month old They bought her for 6 taels of silver And they named her Ruyi Ruyi, is it? Whatever Wait and see Things won't be so smooth always One's just got to wait and watch Chunmei Lock all the gates What? It's not dark yet I'm going to take a nap... with your lady Silly Slut It's so absurd! Chunmei Yes? Come... What are you trying to do? Come... Come there's something I want to show you No... I don't want to look... This game is - 'striking the swan with the golden egg' I'll have to drink if I miss No... Lady... Lady... Lady... The young master... What about him? He fell off his bed What? He... He has breathed his last Lady... Pinger Pinger, what happen? I... saw Hua Zixu What about him? He... Yes, go on! What about Hua Zixu? He... Pinger Lady... Pinger No, it's me, master Pinger It's me Master Ximen Qing finally celebrated his death which he... brought upon himself being over lascivious He was a landlord, an official; the leader of the gangsters He was also a businessman, a bully... and of course a sex addict He tyrannically abused his powers Usurping people's land and wives Couldn't imagine, hardly had his eyes closed... His family broke apart Soon this rich and powerful family crumbled This grand & tall mansion was thrust to collapse All his concubines dispersed like clouds Even if he would have still been alive, He would never have dreamt it'd come to this!
