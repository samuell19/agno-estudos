Hi, I'm Brittany. I'm 22 years old and I'm from Miami, Florida. Hi, I'm Serena. I'm 19 from Riverside, California. Hi, guys. My name is Savana Anna and I'm from Texas. Hi, boys, or should I say men 'cause that's exactly why I'm here, to find a man. My name is Clarissa. I'm looking for a gentleman who loves his little Russian princess. I'm a singer, dancer, actress, you name it. Entertainment is my thing. I don't really usually do this, so this is new for me. I'm looking for a lovely gentleman with big old heart. I am 23 years young and I am ready to mingle with the right guy. I love to be spoiled. I love travelling. I love shopping. I don't like just staying home and watching movies. No offense, but that just sounds a little clich√© to me. Someone that has a little more wisdom and, uh, little more, you know, thicker wallet maybe. I went on one of these dates and this guy went Dutch on me and I was not having it. I prefer older men because they tend to have more money because they have their priorities in line. I'm just looking for a guy who's really nice, fun, good personality and can take me on a really nice date. I don't cook or clean. Your maid can do that. I like going to Vegas. I want a reason to dress up. I love dressing up. I love shopping. I like looking good. Your little Russian princess. So, swipe right if you like me. If you like what you see, swipe right. Swipe right and maybe you and I could be right for each other. If you like what you see, you can just swipe left. Um, or, no, I think it was right. It all starts with the perfect selfie. If you're serious about being a sugar baby, you need to treat it like a full-time job. Candy. Candy. Excuse me, Candy, listen, it is not... It's not my fault that you chose to give a client a discount. And I'm certainly not going to lose money because you made a stupid choice. Hold on a second. Are you Kimberly? - Yeah, it's me. - Just give me one second. If you want to play housewife, I suggest you take a baking class and quit the business and leave the money making to the professionals. In the meantime, pay me my fucking money. Can I get you something? Water. Got it. Please, I can't with you. I'm sorry. Really sorry. - I just... - Don't be. Did I hear you say discount? Because does she know that she's only worth what her cheapest client is willing to pay her? Oh, my God! I'm going to write that down. I can tell we're gonna get along amazing. Raquelle proceeded to tell me about this dating app she was launching. It matches really attractive girls like me with rich guys. he called it Ballers and Babes . The best part is it's legal. There's never an agreement of sex for money. We all know what the game is but since it's never actually said. It's genius. Mm-Hm. And that way, when the girl actually gets it up, he feels like he's scoring. And what is it with men and their obsession for scoring, sports and sex? You need an app? I know a guy. The internet has been invaluable in terms of what it's done for sex. First, it's revolutionized porn. As a kid, I would jerk off to Victoria's Secrets catalog. These millennials don't know how good they have it. And thanks to the prevalence of porn, the quality of sex has also improved. It used to be you were lucky to get head. Now, it's not even foreplay unless you're getting at least that. Now, there are these sugar daddy sites. Craigslist and Tinder were an okay start, guys looking to get laid, girls who wanted to make some extra cash. These sites cut through all the bullshit. It's a pure business arrangement... hot, young girls and rich guys looking to exploit each other. Let the games begin. - It's a beautiful night. - Yeah, it is. Hey, uh, do you think that we could stop at the Apple store on our way home? Uh, why? Well, the new iPhones just came out. Didn't I just buy you a new phone and a new computer last month? - Yeah. - Is it really that much different? Paul, please. I promise we can go back to your place and I'll make it worth your while. Come on. So, here's how this game works. The girls try to drag as much money as they can from a guy while the guys grab as much pussy as possible without going broke. Thank you again for the watch. It's beautiful. It was my pleasure. It's beautiful on you. Also, I hope you don't think I'm awful but, uh, tuition is due. Of course, I got you. And believe me, these girls will try every trick in the book. How's that? Whenever you guys are ready. Thanks for stopping in. Thanks. You got it. Oh, uh, at least let me get the tip. I mean, you've done so much for me. Well, yeah, thank you. - What's this? - It's a Tip N Split. It's a... a light, a calculator, and a magnifier. It's set specifically for tipping. It's genius. - Okay. - Did you know the average American wastes almost a thousand dollars a year in overtipping? I mean, I have expensive taste but I don't believe in wasting money. - So, it's 17.85? - Oh, I will even... even 18. I'm not heartless. Clearly. So, what do you want to do now? Ah, we go for a ride. - We'll pull over, have a bottle of wine. - Yeah. Let's go. Getting money out of Paul was becoming annoying. I don't know if he was having financial problems but it was clear. I am so over this relationship. So, what do you think? Yeah, the screen is so much bigger and the camera totally kicks ass. So worth it. Well, how about we put this away for a while and we can talk about how you're gonna show me your appreciation. Yep, I'm done. You know what, this wine is going right through me. - Let me go to the bathroom real fast. I'll be right back. - Hurry back. - One moment. - Okay. Be right back. Hey, do we have any more wine? Yeah, I have... I have some wine in the truck. I'll get it. Just give me one second. What in the holy fuck? I wish you hadn't had done that. Jesus, Ted, you scared me. Obviously. What is all this? It was supposed to be a surprise but you ruined it. - Ted, that's not funny. - I'm not laughing. Stay away from me, you fucking psycho. Oh, you got spirit. I like that. Most girls just curl up into a little ball. It's gonna be a lot of fun. - Stay away from me, you ass, or I'll fucking kill you. - Give it a shot. You fucking... We both knew this time was coming. This run is over. Now, it's my turn for some fun. Help! No! Fuck! Oh! Don't make me come on that huge cock of yours. Oh, crazy, babe. You want to go again? Uh, yeah, just, uh... just give me a few minutes, okay? Okay. - How about I go get us some wine and you try and get it up? - Perfect. Paul is really nice. I sort of hated to see things end. Inorganic mercury. It's used to make batteries and is deadly when ingested. It's cheap and super easy to get your hands on. I was watching a true crime story on A&E. One of the stories was about a woman who killed her boyfriend for the insurance money. I didn't even know you could take out an insurance policy on someone you weren't married to. That was a game changer. Believe it or not, I was gonna miss Lisa. But I found the best thing to do after a relationship like this is to get right back out there. Technology also makes it incredibly easy to take on different identities which comes in very handy at times. I just heard about this new app. The girls on here are supposed to be insanely hot. Hello, who do we have here? You look like fun. This guy is hot. If you're gonna have to fuck a guy for a while, it's definitely a plus. - Hi, guys, welcome. - Hey. - Did you find everything okay? - I did, thank you. Oh, this is so cute. - Isn't it so cute? - Yeah. I'm going to Coachella, so I thought it would be perfect. Oh, that's gonna... This is gonna be great for Coachella. - Have you been before? - I have, yeah. It's so much fun. - This is my first time, so I'm really excited. - Oh, you'll have a blast. So, 35.82 is your total. So how do you meet these guys anyway? It's the digital age, how do you think? You mean, like Craigslist? Because you know people get killed on there. Oh, don't be silly, Annie. - All right, have so much fun. - Thank you so much. - Bye. - Bye. That's so cute. Do you want to try it on? Um... You know, it might be a little too short. You know, you always want to leave the guys wanting more. It's a good point. I hadn't thought of that. So what, like, Tinder? Yeah, something like that. It's a little more exclusive and tailored towards wealthy men. Yes, I love that. - Do you want to try it on? - Yeah. Perfect. Right this way. So, wait, you don't actually have sex for money with these guys, do you? Annie, we all have sex for money and the guys have to provide if they want us to provide. I just think you should value yourself a little more. That's all I'm saying. Excuse me, sweetie, can I ask you how much you make a month? Oh, um, I don't know, it just depends on commission. The first year, I made 50,000 and that was going on two or three dates a week. And this year, I wouldn't be surprised if I cleared a hundred thousand. And the guys aren't that ugly. - Here you go. - Thank you. Mm-Hm. Aren't you worried about what people are gonna think of you? - Excuse me. - Yeah. What did you say the name of that app was? - It's Ballers and Babes. - Thanks. First, you really have to vet them. Of course, this guy's going to try and impress you with how much money he has. So, it's really important to see if that's real. Also, it's not just about how much money he has but how much he is willing to spend on you. So, Ted, I'm surprised that you managed to stay single for so long. It's, obviously, not because you can't find someone. Well, I've had my fair share of women but, uh, it just never seems to last. What usually goes wrong? I don't know. I mean, for example, I just got out of a relationship and, uh, we had a good run but, uh, things... things had run its course. It's hard to explain. You just get something, you get... kind of get a feeling for it. I went through something similar myself. They must really want to talk to you, they keep calling. - I'm so sorry. - That's okay. You can take it. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Hello. Can you excuse me for a second? Yeah, how can I help you, Detective? I'm afraid I have some bad news. You knew Mr. Paul Sandberg? Uh, yeah, of course. Him and I were dating. I'm sorry to tell you this but, uh, Mr. Sandberg was found dead in his house a few hours ago. Oh, my God! Uh, what happened? Well, we're not sure yet. I think it might be a heart attack. - Hi. - Hey, can I get you anything else right now? - No, I'm okay. - You sure? - Yeah. - All right, great. Hey, what happened to your foot by the way? Oh, I, uh, I got into a... a rock climbing accident. So, you rock climb? - I... I did, yeah. - Not anymore, huh? Not anymore. Not for the moment. Nice. You gotta be pretty strong for that, huh? Yeah. Do you climb? No, I've always been interested though. - Yeah? - Yeah. Me and one of the cooks, we, uh, we... we climb. I'd love to... to... maybe you'd like to come with us one day. - Your boyfriend? - No, he's not. I'm... I'm single. He's just a friend. Nice. Nice. I'm just on a first date over here. - Ah, first dates. - Yes. - I was wondering. - Yes. You know, nice girl. - How's it going? - She's very nice. Very nice person. - Yeah. - Sounds like it's going well. - Yeah. - Good. - I'm, uh, I'm Ted. - I'm Caitlin. - Caitlin. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. We'll go rock climbing sometime when you're on the... on the mend here. That sounds like fun. - I'll... I'll be right back. - Okay. Uh, would you be willing to meet up with me? I need to ask you a few questions. Just routine stuff. Yeah, yeah, of course. Um, I'm... I'm busy tonight, but I can come by first thing tomorrow morning. Oh, yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. - Hi. Everything okay? - Yeah. It was my landlord and, um, there's a leak in the apartment above me. So, it's fine. So, where are you taking me tonight? There is this underground speakeasy downtown. - We got some jazz. Sound good? - Perfect. All right. So, you guys ready for some dessert? We have an amazing peach cobbler. It's homemade. Is it gluten-free? It's peach cobbler. - We'll just take the check. - Great. - There you go. - Thank you. Have a nice day. A heart attack? I mean... I shouldn't be surprised he did eat like shit. No, it wasn't his diet, suicide. He left a note. It was written to you. Really? What does it say? "Dear Kimberly, by the time you read this I will have already crossed over the other side. I'm sorry to leave you in this dark cruel world without me. But just know that you made it a better place for me. I love you and I hope you find happiness like I found with you. Love eternally, Paul." Forensics confirmed it's his handwriting. As you can probably imagine, his wife didn't take it very well. My God! Poor Paul. It's been a while since you've been in. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry about that, I got really busy. Well, I understand. Um, last time you were in was, um, August 6th. How's the Xanax working for you? Yeah, I didn't actually take it. Why is that? Well, I was reading online about some of the side effects and I had some concerns. Like... what? Well, it says it causes confusion and memory loss and there was this woman online who said she called her mom and forgot about it the next day. Do me a favor, stay off the internet. If you have any questions, call me. Get right back to you. I think that we can make progress by... by talking and you letting me know your feelings about the situation. You mean, this stuff with my mom's ex-boyfriend 'cause I don't really want to talk about that. It was... - Yeah. - ...a long time ago. I know, I know. I understand. And, um, it's... it's never easy to talk about. But, uh, you know, if we don't talk about it and you don't start dealing with it, it's never going to go away. And this is probably where your... A lot of this anxiety, a lot of these problems that you've talked to me about having is stemming from. And I think, the more that you can talk about it, and this is... this does not leave this room, this is me and you, and the more that you can talk about it, the easier it'll be for you. Imagine that the one person that's supposed to protect you, she doesn't even believe you. So, that every time you said no, he made it that much worse. Would you want to think about that? No. No. But I have spoken to a lot of young girls who have dealt with it and the best thing I can suggest is for you to start talking about it. So, if you can talk to me about it, the way it made you feel, I think it can make you better. I think I can help you. I really do. Maybe I'll try the Xanax another time. Okay. All right. Fred is a guy I found to help me with the financial arrangements. He has some great connections that are morally pliable and don't ask too many questions. I give him a third of the cut and I let him have sex with me. I know. But it was the only way he would agree to it. Two hundred and fifty thousand minus eighty-two thousand five hundred for me. I gotta say, we make a pretty good team. Team? What do you mean by team? I just mean we work well together and I look out for you. - You look out for me? - Yeah. Yeah, we do make a good team but this is just business. I know. Okay, good because I don't need you falling in love with me. I'm not. But, you know, would that be so bad? Fred, we've been over this. This is business. I know. I'm... I'm just saying, hypothetically, if something were to happen between us. Would that be such a bad thing? You're married. And you kill guys for money, so, you know, let's not be judgmental. Okay, let's just drop it. Okay, you're my business partner and you get to fuck me, - so that's as good as it gets, okay? - Whatever. So, what's this new guy like? He's okay. I mean, he is kind of a loner and good-looking and he fucks me good. What's that supposed to mean, he fucks you good? It means he has a cock and knows how to use it. Is he better than me? You don't want me to answer that, do you? So, hey, how's your guy coming with the new policy? So, what's it like doing it? Is it hard? - Killing the guys? - Yeah. Yeah, the first one was hard but it gets easier. Key is not to let it get too easy so I don't get sloppy. Hey, I got a question. How in the hell did you get that last guy to write a suicide note? That was fucking brilliant. You know, Dr. Harris told me something very interesting today. Yeah? What's that? Well, he told me about this exercise he has people do in his couple therapy session. Mm-Hm. What kind of exercise? He has them write letters to each other. Um, yeah, my first wife and I did that. It did not work out. No, but Dr. Harris has an interesting twist. He has them imagine that they've died and gone to heaven. - You believe in heaven? - Paul, that's not the point. Okay, okay, fine. Go on. So you imagine that you're in heaven and you have one last chance to write a letter to the one person you loved. - Isn't that romantic? - Yeah, if you say so. It sounds a little didactic for my taste. Okay, whatever, I didn't mean to be didactic. What? I'm just saying it's not for me. That's all. Okay, well, I should sleep in my own bed tonight. Wait, wait, okay, okay, let's do it. - What? - Let's do it. Let's write the letters. No, you're just saying like that. No, it... it sounded weird at first but I... It could be fun. Really? You would do that for me? Of course, I'd do that for you. Here, I'll go get the pen and paper. Done. "Dear, Kimberly, by the time you read this I will have already crossed over the other side. See, everything out of context sounds exactly like a suicide note - and he didn't suspect a thing. - Jesus. Remind me never to get on your bad side. Well, just keep these checks coming and you'll be fine. Fair enough. - Wanna go fuck? - Ugh, do we have to? You don't have to sound so excited. Well, do you want to do it or not? Yeah, no, let's go. So, you know how you're gonna do this guy? Um, well, I'm still figuring it out. You know, I'm learning about a lot of interesting non-traceable lethal chemicals. You know, I think I have a knack for this sort of thing. If I had applied myself, I would have done much better in chemistry. Well, you're applying yourself now. It's all that matters. That's true. Thanks, Fred. Just don't be an idiot and do any research on your home computer. Well, if the Casey Anthony thing taught us anything it was that. Yeah, I always use a cheap tablet, free Wi-Fi at a coffee shop - and then toss it. - Good girl. Yeah, so, uh, I still have 30 minutes before I gotta go. You want to go again? Um... Sweetie, if you want more sex than you're getting, we're gonna have to discuss. You getting a lower percentage of your cut. You can't blame a guy for trying. - There you are. - Hi. How you doing? Wow. - Good to see you. - You, too. You look stunning. - What, thanks. - Very welcome. - You look good, too. - Well, thank you. I don't know, is it just me or is this place a little creepy? I don't think so. Besides, you're here with me. What could possibly go wrong? That's true. - Do you... do you like the wine? - Yeah, I like it. Really? It's a little tannic for my taste. But I have a great Pinot. You wanna try it? - Sure. - Here. It's getting chilly out here. - You cold? - Yeah. Let's just have a little more wine then we'll go back. - How you doing tonight, Ma'am? - Good. - Are we not supposed to be here? - No, you're fine. Just, uh, you might want to keep an eye out. There was a murder here a couple of weeks ago. Is everything okay, Sir? Yes, I was just telling the miss here that we had a murder a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, I heard about that. That was right here? Yep, the police suspect we're dealing with a serial killer. They tend to always return to the same place for more victims. You said we. Are you involved in the investigation? Well, not technically, but this is my territory, so I'm doing my part to keep the police informed, warn the public. - That sort of thing. - I see. Well, thanks for giving us the heads up and, uh, good luck with your case. See, I told you this place was creepy? You got great instincts. You were right. Come on, let's get out of here. Well, you folks have a good evening. You too, Sir. Thank you. Come on. Bye. Goddamn fucking cryptids! Fucking hooker, whore, slut fucking bitch! What do we have here? Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you but I'm a little lost here. Uh, sure, where are you going? Well, my client's having a party around here but the guy's not picking up the phone and I can't find the address. - What street does he live on? - Let's see. I think it's, um, Dickens. That's on the other side of Ventura. Of course. This guy wouldn't live on the north side of Ventura. What are you, like a lawyer or something? Worse actually. I'm a talent agent. I represent actors. Really? Yeah, this guy's TV show got picked up. He's having a little party to celebrate. I really hate going to these things but it would be bad for him if I didn't show up since I'm taking ten percent. Right. - Well, thank you for your help. - Yeah, no problem. All right. Hey, I don't mean to sound, uh, too forward but you wouldn't want to come hang with a bunch of superficial TV people, would you? That actually sounds really fun. Great. Hi. I'm Seth. Hi. I'm Nancy. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Nancy. And what do you do? Uh, you're not gonna believe this, but I am an actress. - Get out of here. What a coincidence. - Yeah. - Do you have an agent? - Uh, no, actually not yet. How about, uh, a reel? You have a reel? Yeah, I just, uh, finished a short film. - Fantastic. I'd love to see it. - Really? - Yeah, you have a great look. - Thank you. You're welcome. I've good eye for these things. It's the fourth one this month. It's the worst one yet. - Hey, Kimberly, did you hear? - Hear what, Janet? Nancy, the actress, that lives across the way, she was murdered. Wait, when, what happened? They found her body up by Topanga Canyon. They think it was a serial killer. I was just up there. Oh, no. Yeah, the ranger came by and said that they found another girl's body there. Oh, my God! I don't know what this world is coming to. People are so heartless. - I have to go, Janet. - Oh. - I'll... I'll call you later? - Okay. I like the new signature. And somehow you manage to keep them all looking differently. It's all about the details. Speaking of details, so does he really fuck better than I do? Jesus, Fred, obsessed much? Well, does he? He's got 20 years of experience. But don't worry, it gives you something to work towards and there's really not much you can do about that cock thing. That's cold. You asked. Can you believe it, we were just up there? Yeah, that is eerie. And that girl, she lives so close to me. I hope they catch this son of a bitch. It's fucking scary. Listen, I gotta run but, uh, I'll see you later, right? - Yeah, okay. - Okay, bye. Damn it, that was too impulsive. What was I fucking thinking picking up a random girl off the street, especially in Kimberly's neighborhood? I'm gonna have to find a new spot for next time. And it happened right in my neighborhood, it's... I get so freaked out at any little noise I hear, I feel like someone's breaking in. I don't think you have anything to worry about. I mean, it seems like this guy's luring them in secluded areas and then killing them, he's not breaking into homes, okay? If it makes you feel any better, you can stay here with me tonight. Thanks, Ted. - I do feel safer here. - Good. Oh, fuck. Uh, that was amazing. You should teach guys how to fuck. You could charge a fortune. Thank you. You're good, too. Fuck. Well, you smoke? Why? Does it bother you? I don't have to. Oh, fuck. My doctor says I should quit. That's good advice. Yeah, I had some problems with my liver. I was drinking a bottle of scotch a night. But since I quit it went away. Just have a couple of glasses of wine at night now. So, you're like an alcoholic? No, I was just bored. Now, I've got some new hobbies. - Like fucking young girls. - For example. Well, I'm glad I could keep you healthy. Me, too. There is a breed of mushrooms that when cooked, they look and taste like regular mushrooms. These, however, are highly toxic. As little as one ounce is enough to kill someone. - Eat up. - This is great. Mmm. Delicious. - Good. - I'm impressed. Oh, God! Oh, my God! 911, state your emergency. I... I need an ambulance right away, please. So, how you been doing? Good. Yeah, this week was a little tough but I was seeing this guy and we went out a few times. And how was that? It was really great, but I sort of put an end to things. Why? I don't know. I didn't want it to get too complicated. Considering what you've been through, you're probably afraid of letting a man get too close to you. Maybe. I never thought about it like that. Might be worth the risk. Well, I'll keep that in mind for the future but pretty sure this relationship was over. You never know. Sometimes these things aren't as final as you think. Mm... Yeah, that's true. - But not this one. Yeah. - All right. I don't understand. How did he pull through? I told you, he's like freakishly healthy. This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought. - Or maybe... - What? Maybe you're starting to have feelings for this guy. Yeah, I like Ted. I also liked Paul. But I still acted like a professional. I don't know. I think it's different with this guy. What are you talking about? Well, you're always talking about how good he is in bed and how hot he is and how he takes care of himself. Are you jealous, Fred? No. No. I just think, maybe subconsciously, you didn't want to kill him. Let's get something straight right now. I don't really want to kill anyone, okay? And I don't really enjoy it. But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to do it. Yeah, I like Ted, but business is business. You're right, I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to question your professionalism. I'm just trying to make sure your head's still in the game. Yeah, don't worry where my head is at. You take care of things on your end and I'll take care of the rest. - I'm sorry. - I think you should go. I... I said I'm sorry. I'm the one taking all the risk here, okay? I don't need you questioning me. You're right. I apologize. - I was thinking, uh, maybe we could... - No. Okay, I have a date with Ted later and I want to be well-rested. - Well-rested up for your epic sex? - Exactly. It's really cool. - Yeah, it's really nice of you. - You have a great laugh. No. - It's true. It's true. - Stop. - How you two doing? - Good, my friend. - Would you like some wine? - Yeah. - And you, Sir? - Yes, please. Thank you. You know, I was thinking... maybe we can get out of town this weekend, you know? It sounds nice. What did you have in mind? Yeah. Maybe we'd go to like a small town somewhere, something secluded, I don't know, like a log cabin. It sounds cozy. My friend has a place a few hours up north. We leave on Friday, maybe get brunch on Saturday, bring a bottle of wine, go for a hike. - I am in. - Great. Oh, I have a therapy session at 3 PM, um, maybe we can leave after that. That works. By the way, how's that going? Well, it's going good. I think I'm having some breakthroughs. Really? What kind of breakthroughs? Well, Dr. Harris seems to think that these kind of relationships are leaving me feeling numb. Hmm. What do you think? I think that the idea of having something stable and more long term has its appeal. What about you? Oh, I mean, yeah, that would... sounds nice. I just, uh, I have some... I have some things in my personal life that I don't think would go over too well on a long-term relationship. Like what? Just some hobbies that I have. What could you possibly do in your spare time that would interfere with a relationship like forever? No. No. I'll tell you what, I could show you this weekend. It sounds adventurous. I'm intrigued. You have no idea. I don't know, it just sounds too risky. Why? Don't you trust me? Yes, I trust you, but involving another person, it just complicates things. And why do you want to be involved now? You never wanted to be involved before. Well, I'm just thinking he... he already survived one poison attempt. If he's poisoned again, it could look very suspicious. Yeah, but you're talking about a botched robbery. I mean, have you ever shot someone or fired a gun? I've never killed anyone but I know I could do it. And, yes, I fired a gun. My dad used to take me to the shooting range every Sunday. I'm a pretty good shot. Okay, shooting someone is a lot different than shooting at a target. Look, I'm telling you, I could do it. Okay. How would it go down? There's a mini mart on the way to the cabin, the bathroom's in the back. You just tell him that you need to take a leak. And when you go into the bathroom, you just wait. After a few minutes, call him on his cell phone and tell him that there's no toilet paper in the bathroom, that you need him to bring you some. When he steps around the corner, I'll be waiting there. I'll put two in his head and one in his chest. It just sounds too risky. I... I've already done some recon. There are no cameras back there and hardly anyone ever goes to this place. All you have to do is make sure no one's around when you call him and then just give me some time to make it to the freeway and we're home free. You really think you could do it? - You think you could pull the trigger? - I know I could. You okay? You seem a little quiet. Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, so how far away is this place? Uh, it's like two and a half hours, maybe a little bit more with traffic. If... if you're tired, take a nap, seat goes back. Okay. You sure you don't want anything to drink? - Mm-Hm, I'm good. - Okay. I'll be right back. Lock the doors. Hey, Fred, it's me. Um, yeah, we have to... we have to call the whole thing off. I have a really bad feeling about this. Goddamn it, Kimberly. Everything is already in place. No, trust me, it's not gonna happen. I knew you were falling in love with him. I'll call you later. Fucking asshole. I can't wait to kill your ass. - Did I scare you? - Yeah. Oh. - Whoa. - I told you to lock the door. Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Don't say I never got you anything. It's okay, well, you know what, I am kind of hungry, so. Okay, I'll feed you. - What are you in the mood for? - Anything. Sushi? - You like sushi? - Yeah. Okay, good, it's a good sushi place on the way. Okay. Right after my dad left, my mom lost her job and then she had to go on unemployment and then food stamps. It was just so embarrassing. Then my mom would sell them for really cheap so she could buy booze and cigarettes. You can't buy that stuff with food stamps. - Makes sense why you're so ambitious. - Yeah. Uh, I remember standing in line in the grocery store and my mama will whip out the food stamps. I just felt like everyone was staring at us. From that point on, I swore that I would never be a loser like that. You're the farthest thing from a loser. I'm just happy we were getting away. Me, too. I'm glad you wanted to come. Is this it? Yeah, I know, it doesn't look like much but it's on the inside. It looks kind of scary. Yeah, let me get the lights on, you'll warm up too, I promise. Hey, how did you sleep? Uh, surprisingly well. It's really quiet here, right? There's nobody around for miles. Now, you want to head into town and get some breakfast? Hmm, yeah, I just have to hop in the shower. - You want to join me? - Definitely. You know, this isn't a place I normally come, but I gotta say it's kind of charming. Good. I'm glad you like it. We've got some fun things planned for us. Ooh. Intriguing. How are you guys doing? Can I get you anything else? - Oh, we're good. Just the check, please. - Okay, be right back. Hey, you know, is there a hardware store around here? Oh, yeah, right up the street like three-quarters of a block up you take a right, it's called Johnson's, run by Bobby and his son Earl Jr. Thank you. I gotta grab a couple of things for the house. Shouldn't be too long. You mind waiting here for a minute? Yeah, that's fine. Beautiful. Don't go anywhere. What the fuck are you doing here? Are you trying to sabotage this? - I need to talk to you. - No, you don't. I told you it was off and I'll call you when I get back to L.A. So, you're not gonna do it? I am going to do it. I just need more time. I don't think that's it. I... I think there's something else going on here. Fred, I'm only gonna say this once. Back the fuck off! This is my business and you work for me. I don't think you fully appreciate what I contribute. Okay, you wouldn't even have a business without me. Okay, you're not the only person that sells life insurance. Are you threatening to cut me out? Because that would be a very bad idea. I'm not threatening you. I'm just merely pointing out the fact that compared to what I have to do, your job is very easy. Hey, I'm offering to be more involved, to share more of the risk here. I appreciate that, but I work alone. You're in love with him, aren't you? Fred. Look, it's okay if you are. Just, you know, tell me. Be... be straight about it. And if you want to call it off, we can. Just don't jerk me around. I'm not in love with anyone. I'm going to do it. Okay. If you say so. Yeah, I say so. Now, you need to leave before Ted comes back. I'm only trying to help. You can help by going home. Fine. If you need me, I'll be around. No, don't be around, Fred. Go home. Hello. Anyone here? - Hey, how you doing, Sir? - Nice to see you, my friend. - How you doing? - Excellent. What can we do for you? So, I'm having a little issue back at the house, uh, a dead deer is entangled in my fence there. You have anything that could possibly cut through it? - Yeah, bone you say, huh? - That's the worst. That's tough. Uh, ax saw, that'll do the trick. - Perfect. - Yeah, I got a bunch of them in the back. Oh, great, great. Do you have anything for any clogged pipes? Oh, yeah, I mean, I got a Liquid-Plumr. You need something stronger than that? You know what, it's really, really backed up. You happen to have anything with some hydrochloric acid by any chance? I might, I'm not sure, but we can go check in the back. - Okay, cool. - Right this way, Sir. Hey, watch your step. Hi, Dr. Harris. Um, I'm sorry to bother you on the weekend. It's no problem, Kimberly. What's going on? I'm just having some really bad anxiety border-lining on panic. Go on. And? I'm just having some really weird feelings and I just don't know what's going on. What kind of feelings? Feelings for a person. Okay, I'm listening. I mean, on one hand, I'm really happy with the way the relationship is going and on the other, I'm really conflicted. And that makes you uneasy? Yeah, like... like, I'm losing myself and I can't get my emotions under control and I just... I don't know what's wrong with me. Nothing is wrong with you, Kimberly. Sounds to me like you are in love. What? I am? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Oh, well, that... that's not good. Why not? Well, it really screws up my plans. Welcome to being in love. You just gotta go for it. Uh, I don't know, Dr. Harris, I... I really don't think I am ready for that sort of thing. This is a breakthrough for you, Kimberly. Give it a chance. Okay. Uh, thank you. I... I gotta go. I felt things with Kimberly had gone as far as they were gonna go, so I planned some fun farewell games. Well, fun for me anyway. But then something caught me completely off guard. Ted, there's something I... I have to tell you. And this is a first for me, so keep that in mind. What is it? I'm just gonna be really honest with you. Okay, now I'm scared. You should be. When we first started dating, I was only interested in you for your money. Oh, we met on a sugar daddy app. It's not a newsflash. Yeah. I just... I've just been through a lot of guys and with you it's... It's different with me? Yeah. I... This isn't supposed to happen. What is it? I don't know, it's... your eyes or that you're really hot or you're really good in bed or that you're really smart and you make me laugh. I am falling for you. You don't seem too happy about that. I'm not. But maybe... maybe it's you. - It's my fault? - Yeah. I don't really believe in love. But maybe we're like soul mates. I just had to get that off my chest. I'm glad you told me. Okay. What is it that you wanted to show me? Oh, you know what not today. Maybe tomorrow. What? You're gonna make me wait for that? You'll be glad I did. Come here. - Hey, are you getting hungry? - Yeah, I could eat actually. Well, the place across the street looks pretty good. Oh, this place is good. You want to go there? Yeah. I'm gonna go in the shop real quick. Do you want to get us a table? - Sounds good. - Okay. - Thanks, Ted. - You're welcome. Take the umbrella. - I'll be right over here. - Okay. That was the second time I saw that guy hanging around. First, I thought he might have just been checking Kimberly out, but then I thought it might be something more. When I saw him the second time, I knew for sure he definitely knew her, probably her boyfriend. Not that I really give a fuck. I can't believe I actually sort of believed Kimberly's bullshit earlier. I got it. A gas leak. What the fuck are you doing here? I followed you guys up to the cabin you're staying at. And after you guys went on your little picnic, I picked the lock and I checked the place out. That old stove would work perfectly. What the fuck are you doing? Stalking us? Come on. Just... just listen to me, okay. All you have to do is just wait till Ted's asleep and then just turn one of those knobs, a quarter turn to the right and then just tiptoe out of there. I'll have my car parked up the street always. He'll be dead by morning. Okay, what if he gets up, sees I'm not there and smells the gas? What then, genius? Okay, okay. Well, uh, I... I still have the gun. I could just wait inside the cabin and pop him when you walk through the door. Fred, I swear to God. I knew you were falling in love with him. I'm getting really fucking sick of this, okay. You... you have to leave. Just... just tell me you're not in love with him and I'll leave. - Why? - Because I'm in love with you. I want to be with you. Jesus Christ, Fred. I really can't deal with this now. Ted is waiting for me. I have to leave. Okay, fine. I'm staying at the Pine Tree and if... if you need anything, if you change your mind. Go home. I'll leave my cell on. So, we're pretty beat. - You want to head to bed? - Yeah. Um, give me a minute. I have something I want to put on for you. Beautiful. Don't be too long. There was definitely something going on here. I don't know what game these two are playing but I had some games of my own that I was looking forward to. Did you sleep good? Look, I... I don't know what Fred told you but I... I told him not to go through with it. What are you talking about? Fred, he was... he was gonna try and kill you but I... I called the whole thing off. - He was gonna kill me? - Yeah. At the gas station, he's gonna shoot you but I told him to not go through with the plan. What plan? What plan? Fred, he sells life insurance and he takes out policies on the guys. It was really easy. And I just... I kept doing it and I'm sorry. You kill guys for money. And you were going to kill me. Yeah. But I... I meant what I said the other night. You are a fucking filthy vile whore piece of fucking trash. I am gonna rid the world of all of you. I am here to do the devil's work, do you understand? Please, please don't do this. You don't have to. Please. I remember begging like that when I was five years old and I begged my father not to kill my dog. And you know what he did, he slit his throat. Oh, yeah, I should have fucking killed you quick like the rest of them. There was just something about you. You're the serial killer? I'm surprised it took you this long to figure it out. You killed my neighbor that night you dropped me off? That was supposed to be you. That park ranger interrupted. I was falling in love with you, and to think I was feeling guilty for trying to poison you. Poison me? That night with the spaghetti and the mushrooms. That was you? Yeah. Bullshit. You have your juice this morning? You're bluffing. And if you're fucking lying to me, I'm gonna cut your tongue out and then I'm going to cut from here all the way to here, and then I'm going to cut this eye out. And then, I'm going to slit your throat until you fucking die while you watch me with this eye. So, let's go get the antidote. How are you feeling? Still a little queasy but better. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry for scaring you. You must think I'm a monster. No, I... I don't. I appreciate that. Why do you do it? I've asked myself that thousands of times. All I could tell you is that I'm wired different than most people. Well, maybe I am, too. We both kill. Just for different reasons. Yeah. Does it have to be women? Why? I don't know, I was... I was thinking that this doesn't have to be the end, like maybe we could come up with an arrangement. Go on. Maybe I could throw some men your way and we already know each other's secrets, so... - Sex is good. - Yeah. I'm willing to give it a shot if you are. It's Fred. What do you have to say now? Nothing. Nothing. You don't kill me. I kill you. Never fuck with me. My mother fucked with me. My dad fucked with me. You don't fuck with me anymore. Anymore.
