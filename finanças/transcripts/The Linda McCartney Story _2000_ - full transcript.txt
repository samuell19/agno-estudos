The pink Chanel suit on page 10. Yeah. You can find it at saks, and you're welcome. [People chattering] I could almost touch the Beatles when they walked by. Weren't they fab? I couldn't hear them through the screaming. I still like the stones better. I love them all. Oh, hey, Rick. Come here for a sec. We need your opinion on something. Mmm. Now who do you like better, the Beatles or the stones? The who? That's another group. The rolling stones. Now you want to sell some magazines, you put them on your cover. They are so sexy. Never heard of 'em. Anyway, June is the Deb cover. Oh, boring, boring, boring. The Deb of the year in a long white gown. Look at US, Rick. We are young. We're interested in pop stars. We're not interested in being debs. It's out of the question. [Sighing] [Phone ringing] He's going to do it. You just watch. I know he is gonna do it. Why would he listen to you? He doesn't even know who they are. My father's company owns the magazine. Daddy's the president of hearst. [Chuckling] Oh, of course. (Woman) You know it's such a good idea. It's so groovy. Oh, god. Felicia? Come here. What? "Meet the rolling stones on board the taconite "in a press conference to kick off their u.S. Tour." [Sighing] Well, it's addressed to the magazine. And there are no names. Ok, so you go to Rick's office, and you remind him that the cover story was your idea... Right. ...and that you insist, you insist on going. Ok. All right. Ok. Hey, I'm going as your photographer.

(Linda) That one afternoon set my life on a new course. I started hanging around in clubs with my camera. I never thought of it as a job, although, eventually, I did earn my living from it. [Camera clicking] Somebody said there was an amazing group down at ondines, ♪♪♪♪[music playing] So I went down there. [All clamoring] I had no idea I was photographing futur e icons.

Cool. Good. Pretty good. [Crowd cheering] [People whistling] Nice, huh? Hmm. [People clamoring] (Linda) My early pictures came out of my friendships with the musicians. We'd meet, and since I always had my camera, I'd take photos while we hung out. If things happened later, well, the '60s was a very different time. [Church bells ringing] (Jim) It's been a while since I was in church. I love the light here. The architecture. It's like being in a painting. It is real peaceful. So what was it like for you before you became Jim Morrison of the doors? I was a fat, little military brat. Your dad was military? Mere admiral. U.s. Navy. Hmm. Oh, I hated everything he stood for, though. Tell me. It's about being tough. Macho. Stiff upper lip thing, you know? Hmm. Poetry was for wimps. You didn't talk about pain.

Let's show grandpa what you learned. Ooh. That's terrific, sweetheart. Is she taking lessons? She's too young. Not too young to be thinking about her education. What about the Dalton school? She loves her nursery school. Wait too long, and she won't get in. Dad, sis, dinner's ready. Hey, come on. Dad, you haven't said what you think. I'm not thrilled my daughter's hanging around with a bunch of long hairs. Did you like my work? It's nothing to hang on the wall. This magazine's going to be gone in 6 months. Dad, I got a contract to, uh, take pictures for a book. Do you-- do you want to give me some free legal advice? Let's have a look. Rock and other 4 letter words. Yeah. They're paying me to take pictures of rock groups. Well, you didn't sign this I hope. This deal is lousy. Don't tell me not to do it. Are you kidding? A measly $1,000 advance? Yeah. It gets me to San Francisco and Los Angeles and London. I have to get the Beatles. What do you want to go to London for? It's a waste of time and money.

Do you believe in fate? Definitely. (Linda) I'd left my portfolio for Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager. 2 days later he called to say he liked my work and invited me to a press launch for the Beatles' fabulous new album, sergeant pepper. Right, hey, girls, what are you doing later? [People chattering] (Les) All right, all right, that's it for now. (John) No, no, I'm too tired, mate. (Les) Let's give the lads a break, here, ok? Thanks. (John) Small, but we did... Did you get everything you needed? Nice one. [People chattering] Who came up with sergeant pepper? It's brilliant. (Paul) Oh, thanks. It was my idea. A bit of a disguise for the lads. Change of identity. [Linda giggling] Just a bit of fun, you know? And the name, sergeant pepper? Well, you know those little packets you get on airplanes? Mmm-hmm. Someone said to me, "oh, could you pass me the salt and pepper?" And I thought, salt and pepper. Sergeant pepper. Just a bit of a pun. That's all. Playing with words. What a mind. And, uh, lonely hearts club band just seemed to flow. Traveling band. Gypsies. And are you a lonely heart? Well, that depends, doesn't it? How long are you staying? I have to get back. I have a little daughter, Heather. She's 4. So you're a mother? Mmm-hmm. I miss her when I'm away. Oh, kids are great. I love 'em. I envy blokes who have 'em. I plan to have a family of my own some day. [Motorcycle engine rumbling] Heather! [Laughing] Where are your clothes, monkey? I took 'em off. Can I take your picture? Come here. Oh, you look perfect. Put your arms right here. (Man) Hi, how are you? [Clicks] That's good. Danny, I'm in love. Yeah, so what's he like? Did you sleep with him? None of your business. Well, did you? Why does it matter? Linda. Danny. No, I didn't. We are talking about Paul McCartney of the Beatles? Heartthrob of millions? Ok, so you didn't have sex with him. You've spent no time alone. You don't know when you'll see him again. And you were together for what, like, an hour? Mmm. Do you want something to drink? Yeah. Danny, when have I ever said that I was in love? Honey, what about this actress, uh, what's her name? Jane something. He's been living with her for 5 years. He'll never marry her. Has he asked you? He doesn't know my number. (Linda) I didn't see Paul for a whole year, but from the moment we met, I somehow knew we'd meet again. [Male announcer chattering on TV.] In 1968, he and John came to New York to announce their new company, apple records. (Male reporter) The contract dispute. (Male reporter #2) Are you planning to leave your old label, boys? Was there a falling out? It's all about the music, lads. Teamwork, integrity, working together as a band. (Paul) Artistic freedom. It's the, uh, it's the Beatles answer to men in suits. You know, controlled weirdness, 'cause the, uh, the bosses aren't in it for the profits. Yeah. A kind of western communism. (Female reporter) Are you a socialist? (Male reporter #3) When are you going to cut your hair? [People laughing] That's all. Thank you. [Reporters clamoring] (Linda) There. Now he has my number. [Giggling] Cool. Hi, it's Linda eastman. Are there any messages? (Woman) Yeah. Paul McCartney from London. He did-- did-- he did? Did--did he leave a number? No. He's on his way to Los Angeles and would like you to meet him there at the Beverly Hills hotel. Is that it? Isn't that enough? [Birds chirping] Hello? Paul? Hi. Hi. You're here. Yeah. Of course. [Moaning] [Giggling] Want some more? Yeah. [Giggling] [Birds chirping] [Exhaling] Good morning. Hey. What are you doing? The light here reminds me of Tucson. Tucson. Is that a real place? Mmm-hmm. In Arizona. I always dream of a little house there, an adobe, and a-- and a horse. Is that where you grew up? No. It's where I got free. Got free? (Linda) Yeah. Society. Husband. Family. It's so beautiful there. Desert. It's nature all around you. When I was growing up in liverpool... Mmm. ...i used to go into the woods looking for frogs. Frogs? Mmm, frogs. With me, it was salamanders. Salamanders, eh? Mmm. That's nice. Mmm-hmm. (Paul) She was a nurse. Midwife. I remember one night, her riding off in the dark on her bike 'cause a baby was on the way. [Crickets chirping] Very kind and loving, me mum. She used to say to me-- she used to say, "hey, just let it be, son." If I was upset or something, just let it be. Mmm, what was her name? Mary. Hmm. Mary McCartney. Oh, she never said a word to the doctors or any of the nurses about the lump in her breast or the pain. Typical nurse perhaps. Took care of everybody else but not herself, you know? By the time they did the mastectomy, it was too late. How old were you? 14. Me brother was 12. And one terrible night, US boys went down the hospital. Oh, they must have known she was dying, but we didn't really know what was happening. It turned out to be our last visit. (Linda) I had never forgotten that story Paul told me 27 years ago. I felt his pain, and I never wanted him to feel that way again. Hey, good morning. Oh. Oh, I overslept? Stay in bed. I'm off. I'll phone you from the studio. Mmm. Isn't chrissie coming today? [Yawning] Uh-huh. A lump? What kind of lump? It's nothing. It's like this little swollen gland or something. The doctor said it was a virus or a flu or something, and he's having me take antibiotics and rest and... Does Paul know? Do you want to try my chili? (Both) It's vegetarian. Whoa. That's hot. Thank you. Mmm-hmm. When's the last time you had a mammogram? Mmm. It's been a while. It is good and hot-- if ever. Uh, look, McCartney, you got to get this checked out. [Mumbling] Yeah. Yeah. I know. Typical chrissie hynde. Hey, I don't want to lose you. Promise you'll go up to London and see a specialist. I promise. And tell your husband, for god's sakes. I don't want him to worry. (Man on intercom) There's a phone call for you, Mr. McCartney. [Piano stops playing] Hello. (Linda) Hi, it's me. [Sniffing] I got the results of the test. And? It's not good. Mmm-hmm. It's all right, baby. It's all right. [Crying] So sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, it is not your fault, ok? There are so many things I can do, and I can beat this. I know I can. It's not like mum. They've got all these new drugs and treatments now. Besides, you caught it early, didn't you? You caught it early. You didn't even know it was there. I think, maybe-- [Shushing] Listen. We'll go anywhere in the world. We'll find the best specialist there is. We'll beat it. You'll see. [Whispering] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. (Mason) We'll treat it aggressively. First radiation, then chemotherapy. No mastectomy. No. The cancer's moved beyond the breast into the lymph nodes. Chemo is systemic. It attacks the cancer wherever it's hiding in the body. Now, it won't be a picnic. You'll probably be tired, nauseous, very weak. You may lose your hair. It's a good idea to be fitted for a wig now, so they can match your hair color. How soon do you start? The sooner the better. Right away then. [Birds chirping] [Scissors snipping] You've never looked more beautiful, darling. (Heather) How do I look, mummy?

[Baby crying] Ringo, George and I have been cooling our arses for two bloody hours in the studio, and you don't have the bleeding decency to show up. Oh, like you've never kept me waiting. What about US out there, eh? What about US? Why didn't you tell US you couldn't make it? So I'm sorry, all right! Lin and I were celebrating our anniversary! [Glass shattering] [Baby crying] Hey! John. Happy anniversary, mate. [Door slamming] (Mason) The cancer has shown up in your other breast here. So, what, it's spreading? Not necessarily. It's possibly a new cancer. So what now? More radiation? More chemo? I'm sorry. Oh. So what do I tell people? I've been saying that eating veggie reduces your risk of cancer. Don't worry about that now. They'll feel deceived. Lin, the most important thing right now is to get you better. Now, we, uh, we read about this experimental bone marrow treatment in California. 50% remission rates, right? Unconfirmed statistics. The procedure needs more testing before we know. But you could do it here? Only if you take part in randomized clinical trials. It's our policy. Randomized, meaning? You're assigned either to a control group getting standard chemo or to the experimental treatment group. Like a Guinea pig. So we have no choice about it? It has to be random. But if it's lin's best shot, can't we just pay for it if we want the experimental treatment? There are other places that do it, yes. Not here. Not until we know it works. There are serious risks. The dosage is lethal. It kills off your bone marrow which must be replaced. It's a long difficult ordeal, and there's no guarantee it's any better than what we're already doing. (Receptionist) Dr. Mason's office. Dr. Mason, they're ready for you. Think it over and let me know. Right. Thanks. Oh, it's a bloody crap shoot is what it is. No. We'll go. We'll go to la. We'll get the treatment. What have we got to lose? Everything. (Paul) So are we gonna continue as a group or not? Listen, lads. We've got to get back to performing. It's been three years since we were last on the stage. I can't see US doing massive big shows again. Ok. So, so we'll go back to small clubs. (George) The Beatles. Impossible. Right. We could go unannounced. We-- we could go in disguise. Change your name. [Chuckling] There's a thought. What a trip. I think you're daft. I'm not supposed to tell you, but I'm leaving the group. Come on, yoko. John. (Paul) It's the end of the Beatles. Without John, there's no group. But it's not the end of apple. It's the only job I've ever had. We got to find a way to cut you loose. Under the contract you signed, apple owns everything you make, every song you write for the next seven years. Even if the band breaks up? And Grossman gets 20%. Oh, you know I never even signed with the bastard. Oh, we can sue to break the contract. They'll never let you out of it voluntarily. [Sighing] All right, fine. Great. Let's do it. Yeah, stick it to him. You can't sue Grossman. He wasn't party to the apple agreement. You have to sue to dissolve the partnership. Sue John, George, Ringo? No, I can't do that. No. It's the only way, Paul. (Judge) In view of the tangled state of the Beatles financial affairs, the unconvincing testimony of Mr. Bruce Grossman, and the absence of staff capable of giving necessary direction, the court grants the petition of Mr. Paul McCartney and appoints a receiver to take over the running of the partnership until a full trail can be held to determine the long-term disposition of the Beatles company. [Dog barking] McCartney, who the hell do you think you are? (Woman) Dr. Hunter to radiology. Dr. Hunter to radiology. Ok, now, you ready for this? All right, hang on. Anyone we know? Oh, look. Here's trouble. Hello, love. How you doing? Hello, beautiful. Something I made for you. Presies. Great. Oh. Oh, Heather. It's beautiful. It's a medicine jar. A hopi design. Mmm-hmm. This is amazing. Look at the detailing. Look at this, Paul. Yeah, it's amazing. Come here. Give me a kiss, talented girl. Heather, I just want you to know that if anything goes wrong-- it won't, will it? You said not to worry. Yes, I did, and-- and I meant that. (Linda) But with high doses of chemo, there's always a risk. I just want you to know that I will always, always be there. Oh, mama, I love you. I love you, too. Come here. Hug me. Good, sweet girl. [Girl laughing] (Linda) After the breakup of the Beatles, Paul was depressed for some time. I was beginning to wonder if things would ever be the same. Whee! Be careful. (Heather) Ok. Paul, you should see this. It's so cute. Mary and Heather are riding in a little wheel barrow. Do you wanna go up with them to, uh, to see the lambs? Do you want me to run you a bath? How about I fix you something to eat? I'll make you anything that you want. I meant food. Just leave me alone. No. No, no, I will not leave you alone. It's been way too long for this. You need to get out of that shirt. You need to go outside! Oh, what's the point, eh? I'm on the bloody scrap heap. Can't you see that? I'm no use to anyone. You are a brilliant songwriter, Paul. No, not without John. He was right, you know. On me own, I'm just a sentimental turd. No. That is not true. You're not Engelbert Humperdinck or whatever the hell that he said, and you do not need those guys. You are a grown man, and you do not need John. [Glass shattering] Just leave it, will ya? Just leave it, lin. You don't know what you're talking about! Oh, where are you going? Out! [Sobbing] I'm scared. I'm scared, lin. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know. [Sighing] You have to pull yourself out of this, because I can't. And you have to stop blaming yourself because it is not your fault, and it is definitely not mine. Oh, Linda, I don't think I can. You can. I know you can. You have your work. You have your music. I feel empty. That's how I feel. Just like when mum died. That's what it's like. [Sighs] All alone. I loved John, you know, I really loved him. You are not alone. No, the way things are going, you'll leave me, too. [Sobs] Are you kidding? I am crazy in love with you. Darling, I will never, ever leave you. You can count on it. [People chattering] Hi. Hello, darling. How you feeling? Hot. Hot? How do I look? Oh, you look very sexy. Yeah? Yeah. You look gorgeous, like a Buddhist nun. Hmm. Well, sort of. Holy. Holy like Swiss cheese. Like Swiss cheese. Hey. What? This kissing, I believe, is not allowed. Oh, I don't see why not. [Knocking on door] I don't think so. Oh, hang, on. Dr. Bone marrow. Hey. How we doing? Look, it's gonna get rough for a while. It's a slow recovery process. Your body needs time to build itself back up, ok? Ok. I'll check back with you in a while. I'm gonna sleep for a while. Yeah, you sleep, darling. You sleep. (Paul) Are you in pain? [People chattering] Hi. Baby's fine. She's in the nursery. She? Yes. So it's Stella. Stella. [Moaning] Oh, I'm so sorry it had to be a cesarean. I might have lost you both. Rough life for daddy. Rough life for me. You have no idea. I was standing outside, standing outside waiting. [Linda laughing] A sort of vision came to me. A bit of a prayer. You know, like angel wings and I thought, "hey, that'll be good for the band." Wings. I like it. Lin, I've decided what I wanted to do. I want US to form a band together. You and me. Go on stage together. But I'm not a musician, Paul. Remember? So what. Neither was I to start out. What did we know? We were just 4 kids banging away in a garage. Yes. But you're Paul McCartney, and I would be the first to tell you that you don't need a total amateur on stage with you. I mean it. Listen, the best thing about the Beatles was being up there with your best friends. Well, you're me best friend. I want you on stage with me. I love you so. I want you with me every second. Darling. Of every minute. Darling. Darling. Of every hour. I don't play an instrument. ♪♪♪♪[Piano playing] (Paul) Now you make a chord. 3 fingers like this. (Linda) Oh. Now, pay attention. Watch. Ok. Mmm-hmm. Here or you can play them one at a time. See, and that's an arpeggio. Very good. [Linda giggling] So then, from there you make other cords, or you can play around like little melodies. That's beautiful. You see? That's really-- that's really all it is. Yes. Just messing around till you find something you fancy. Mmm-hmm. I always hated piano lessons. Oh, it's the yawn. Look. Look, you. I'm a bit nervous, too, you know? It's been five years since I played in front of a live audience. Hardly ever without John. So we'll keep it simple, ok? Ok. Start at square one. Ok. Little "c." [People chattering] Yeah. Yeah, I'm serious. Paul McCartney. Yeah, Paul McCartney, the beatle. I'm not joking. He just walked in, and he said he wanted to perform for US. (Paul) Hello, I'm Paul McCartney. [Crowd cheering] Thank you. Nice. Oh, it's great to be here. It's lovely to be here at Leeds university. I'd like to introduce you now to the new band, wings. [Band playing off key] One, two. I-- i-- [Microphone feedback] [Crowd muttering] What's up, love? I forgot the chord. What? I forgot the chord. All right. Ok. Don't worry. There we go. All right. Ok. All right. Ok. And this is me better half, lin. [Crowd applauding] Is it, uh, is it all right if we start now, love? Yeah? Ok, thanks. One, two, three. ♪♪♪♪[Kansas City playing] ♪♪ Ah, Kansas City ♪♪ ♪♪ going to get my baby back home ♪♪ ♪♪ yeah, yeah ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm going to Kansas City ♪♪ ♪♪ going to get my baby back home ♪♪ ♪♪ yeah, yeah ♪♪ ♪♪ well, it's a long, long time too ♪♪ ♪♪ my baby's been gone ♪♪♪♪ (Linda) We started off small by crisscrossing england and eventually Scotland. Crowds everywhere loved Paul and the critics had a lot to say. (Linda) "The former beatle has gone from Lennon and McCartney "to McCartney and Mrs. "Her colorless, amateurish singing makes me wonder "what Paul could be thinking to let his untalented wife "elbow her way onto his stage." It's me who wants you on stage. I'll have me bloody cat on stage if I want. I did not ask for this. I do not want this. Mick Jagger said that he would never have his old lady on stage with him. Yeah, well, screw him. I already have. You're not quitting, you know? You're not.

How did you get in here? It's like the Pentagon down there. It's Christmas, man. We wanted to see you. We missed you. How are you? Great. Come on. Come in, man. You look great. Linda. Hi, John? Fabulous. Thank you. This is-- this is fabulous. (Yoko) We love Tokyo. Okura hotel. Fabulous. Our home away from home. Yeah, we're dying to go to Japan, [clearing throat] But they won't let US in the country. At least not yet. Denied US visas because of my criminal record. [Laughing] Because of this. Can you believe it? We were in la two months ago, and we got stopped, and they found two joints in my purse, two lousy joints. Hey, man, they're trying to kick me out of the u.S. Same thing. You ever coming home then? They're always on me about US getting back together, you know? I know. It's a drag. Too much pressure. I prefer New York. Come see US again, eh? Yeah. (Yoko) And bring the kids next time. Yeah, of course. We will. We will. And, uh, bring the old guitar. Yeah, soon. Promise. Merry Christmas, John. Merry Christmas. (Linda) Being mobbed by fans and journalists in Tokyo at the start of the wings world tour was a nightmare. We had our kids with US including baby James and thought a quiet vip. Entrance had been arranged. [People chattering] (Man) Mr. McCartney, picture. Hey, you take him. Here. [Photographers clamoring] How's it going? (Paul) Hey, big guy. Oh, great. Wonderful. Mr. McCartney. Hang on. Listen, this is a mistake. [Speaking in Japanese] Hang on. Listen. Listen, mate. This is a-- it's a mistake. It's just a mistake. Mr. McCartney. Mr. McCartney, you're under arrest. (Linda) Where are you taking him? No. Paul. Hey, come on. Lin, just keep an eye on the kids. You come with me both. The hotel, please. It's fine. It's fine. [Speaking in Japanese] (Stella) Mummy, it's on again. [James whimpering] (Linda) It's ok. What's going to happen to him? I don't know, darling. They'll probably keep him overnight. Release him with a fine. Keep him where? I don't know. I don't know. [Cell door opening] [Speaking in Japanese] Mr. McCartney. Dolan Warren knott, British vice council. Very pleased to meet you. Linda must be frantic, eh? Look, we haven't spent a single night apart, you know? So, uh, how long before you can get me out of here? I'm afraid it's not quite so easy, Mr. McCartney. The Japanese are a rather conservative lot on matters such as drugs. By violating their laws, you've shown disrespect to Japan is the way they see it. No. No. No. No disrespect. No disrespect. I just-- I just didn't think, that's all. Well, there's a chap in here who was caught with much less marijuana than you, and he's been locked up for 3 months already. They could give you eight years. Eight-- eight years? Oh. That's barbaric. Yes. But there it is. Look, it's past midnight. I'll visit with your wife in the morning. Rest assured, Mr. McCartney, we shall do everything we can. [Cell door opening] Lin. Lin. Hi. [Sighing] Six days feels more like six months. Oh, how are the kids? Worried, but we're ok. The band left once they realized that there was no way to save the tour, but... Well, they're not happy. Oh, it was so incredibly dumb. [Laughing] I know. [Reporter speaking in Japanese] [Crowd cheering] [Chattering] (Linda) I've had it with touring. 10 years of packing and unpacking. Hauling the kids all around the world. Living out of hotels. I'm tired. Tokyo was rough. It was tougher on you than on me. I promise it won't happen again. No. No more touring. Promise me that. Lin, I can't. Stepping up in front of an audience is my life. What about my life? All right. I'm sorry. Our life. There are other things that I want to do. Like your photography book. Great. My photography book. My vegetarian cookbook. We're always saying that people in our position should make a difference, so let's do more for animal rights. And we should spend more time at home with our family. [Chuckling] Be safe. Be warm. Love you. Thank you so much. Bye, mummy. Bye, baby. [Bird squawking] What's wrong? John's dead. (Male reporter) The news of John Lennon's death has stunned the world. Fans keep a constant vigil outside the Dakota apartments in New York City where he was shot last night. Whenever-- whenever anyone I love dies, I never get a chance to say goodbye. ...as soon as the word was made public. Most say they just want to be near the place where this icon... Mum. ...was gunned down. Now John. Poor yoko and Sean. Will he even remember his daddy? Oh, he'll never forget John. No one will ever forget John. Oh, god. Oh, god. [Dog barking] [Creaking] [Moans] Oh, sorry, love. Did I wake you? No. I had another nightmare. Oh. [Sighing] It's the nights that are worse, eh? That's when all the fears come creeping in. I just wish I could see more progress. [Sighing] Come here, you. They warned US it'd be a slow process. At least they haven't used the word "aggressive." You know it's bad when they say that. I haven't heard that word. If I die, it'll be a family without a mother. Lin, please don't. Sometimes it's so hard. Sometimes I just wanna give up. Please. Don't. Your tests look fine. No sign of cancer in either breast. Yeah? It's gone. So that trip in la was worth it. Well, I wish I could say that but it's too soon to tell. The cancer's in remission, not gone. So far we can only hope to contain it, not cure it. But it's good news. Contain it? For how long? That's impossible to tell. You'll need to be monitored in London every two weeks to make sure. So I can do whatever I want? Quality of life is essential. [Sobbing] Hey. Hey. It's wonderful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Linda) Ok, hold that. What do you think? That could be a great album cover, babe. Mum, it says parsley. Are you sure you don't mean basil? Hmm. Oh. Oh, no. You're right. It-- it is basil. Call the editor. (Linda) I want to include the flowers that I took in the photo show, and let's include these ferns. I took them at kew garden. Ok. (Mary) The florist is cool. The invitations will be ready Friday, and Stella's working on my dress. Oh, I hope she has something for me. Nothing seems to fit, and I've got her Paris fashion show coming up. Mum, you're beautiful as always. (Paul) We can do that. Of course, we can. Yeah, but we'll have to pick it up a bit 'cause the tide's coming in. I want shells. What? It's shells, it's shells you like. Oh, Paul. Oh, you like that, do you? Yeah. Well, let's see. Hang on. There's more over there. I'm sure there are. [Seagulls cawing] (Paul) Hey, there's lots of 'em. You have to wash them though. That's it, see? Hey, are you all right, darling? Mmm-hmm. What's up? I just got so tired. Oh, look. Come on. Come on. Let's get you home. You're all right. Come on. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. Come on. Let's go. Here. Let me take that. [Camera clicking] Wonderful. Thank you. It's so peaceful here. So beautiful. How are your wedding plans coming, darling? Everything's going so well. Mary, do you think that it might be possible to move up the date? Why, mum? Because I wanna be there. And things aren't going well. I talked to a doctor, and it's in my liver. Mary, will you promise me something? If anything should happen to me, will you take care of your father? Of course, I will. We all will. [People chattering] To our lovely star, Stella, whose fashion's successful. You liked it? [Chuckling] We loved it. I am so proud of you. Never in a million years would I have thought that I would produce a Paris fashion whiz. You either. Oh, I don't know. [Chuckling] Brilliant. Thank you. (Woman) Hello, again. Hello. Great show, Stella. It was so good. Thank you. When did you replace Karl lagerfeld? (Both) November. [All laughing] Don't mind US. Don't mind US. We're just the silly, proud parents. Do you mind if I steal her? There some people who really wanna meet her. Hey, she's all yours. Come on. Love you. How about some more champagne? [Sighing] You all right, mum? Listen, if you're tired, we can run you back to the hotel, you know? Where I really wanna go is Arizona. [Birds chirping] We're so lucky, Paul. It's so beautiful here, and it's been here for hundreds of years, and it will be here long after we're gone. (James) You all right, dad? Can I get you something? No. No. You get off to bed. [Dog barking] [Birds chirping] Morning, mum. Good morning, beautiful. Brought you some breakfast. Oh, baby, I'm not hungry. I'll just leave it here then. Mmm. We have an idea. Why don't I bring the horses down, get them ready? We can go for another ride. Yeah? I don't really fancy a ride today. No? Well, would you rather go and sit down by the pool? I'm so tired. You just fancy a bit of a lie in, yeah? You and me both. [Birds chirping] [Moaning] [Gasping] [Panting] Hey, lin. [Moaning] Can you hear me, eh? Can you hear me? I love you, lin. I'll love you forever and ever. [Line ringing] Hi, it's Paul McCartney. I think you should send a nurse. No. Right now. (Mary) What is it, dad? Go wake up the other kids. [Birds chirping] You're on your favorite place on earth. You're up on your beautiful appaloosa stallion, lin. It's a fine spring day. The bluebells are out. The sky is just clear blue. Clear blue. [Sobbing] (Paul) Linda died in the early hours of April 17, 1998. She fought a courageous battle to conquer a disease, but it wasn't meant to be. As a mother, she was the best. We always said that all we wanted for the kids was that they would grow up and have good hearts, and they have. She lives on in all of them. I'm privileged to have been her lover for 30 years, and in all that time, except for one absence, we never spent a single night apart. She was the kindest woman I ever met. She was unique. And the world is a better place for having known her. Her message of love will live in our hearts forever.
