[drum] [gunshots] [drum] [music playing] Look, I want to go on record that I think this is wrong. This is going to be the last time. This is just plain dangerous. So is this. [music playing] You hear something? Like what? Like-- like a Rambo. Huh? You've been dropping acid again? Just a little. I think I'd better break out some coffee. [crash] Uh, huh? Wha? Oh, god! Oh, god! COLE: Jesus! Oh, Jesus! Oh, yes! COLE: Oh! oh! [inaudible] [yelling] [explosion] [music playing] I don't suppose the perpetrator of last nights pyrotechnic display would care to come forward? What is this, Animal? It's a salami, sir? Couldn't you wait till breakfast? No, sir. What's this, son? It's for your hand, sir. Just chew on it. It's certainly a nice morning, sir. What are we going to do today? Detonator. This is it. It was you, wasn't it? I told you time and time again. Uh, sir. Sir-- Detonator was with-- me all right, sir. Yes, to take care of the rats in the barracks, sir. We blowed them up. We blowed them up real good. Fort Lepter was just supposed to be a way station for me on the road of life. I was just hoping I could, you know, relax a little before I die. COLE: Top of the morning to you, Major. Headache. Lieutenant, your men are a mess. I know. Cole. Cole. Yes? You understand, don't you? This camp is hell to me. Your men are the dregs. They are useless. It's not wonder they call us Fort Leper. And my punishment is to be in charge here. Don't be so hard on yourself, Major. You're just barely in charge. I knew you'd understand. You know, I could have had you discharged numerous times for some of your antics, Cole. I never did. You know why? We're just one big happy family. ZIP: No, no that's not it. I never knew why until now. I have an important announcement to make. I had a call this morning from General Makepeace himself. It seems that we at Fort Lepter have been chosen to play host to and compete in the 26th Annual South Western Command War Games. [cheers] Shut up. Do you realize we'll have to get into shape for this? [groans] This is why you're still here, Cole. You're a shooter-- the best-- the best in the Army. I don't know why you've been given this gift. But by god, we're going to put it to use. Winning these games could mean redemption! [music playing] Thanks a lot. [inaudible]. [scream] [crash] [groan] Jesus Christ. [music playing] At last. Major Zip, are you OK? Sir, I'm Andy Parker. I-- I-- I just wanted to say I-- I think we can play this game, sir. Keep that thought. Call me Harley. Plato. Oh, should I used the plate? [crash] 100% steel. You've got a metal plate in your head? Yeah, courtesy of a chopper blade-- Vietnam. I always wanted to be a flyer. Yeah? [helicopter sound] We'll start him off with the tires. [whistle] SERGEANT: You ladies are going to give me 20, aren't you? Huh? [whistle] All right! All right! Get down there! [groan] [whistle] Let's go. Let's go. [music playing] [beep] [explosion] Can we do it, men? Yeah! All right. [whistle] [laughing] [knock] Looks bad. Real bad. No, no, there aren't any tires laid out on the battlefield. It's the spirit that counts. All right, men, let's try it again-- a little bit slower-- one at a time. Right, men? Spunky bunch of guys you got there, Marion. Please don't call me Marion, sir. Don't look so sad, Major Zip. It's not whether you win or lose. It's how you play the game. Isn't that right, General? You should see us shooting, sir. I'm looking forward to it, Marion. [thump] [gunfire] [laughing] [gunfire] Blind group, Major. Let's get going. That's a one-- Lieutenant Harley Cole. He must be rendered inoperative. Have I ever let you down? No, not right now, dear. This is too important. These men must not win the games. Oh, man. What kind of an operation would move guys like us out of these nice comfortable barracks to some stinking tents outside in the cold? The Army. Plato. Finish up here. Let's check out the competition. [music playing] [inaudible] the Vipers. Now we're fucked. Piece of cake. Animal, let's dip them out. These guys are fags. You may want to take that back. OK, we will. [music playing] [groaning] Oh, heel, heel. Why don't you save your strength for the games? Don't tell me-- we're playing you guys. I didn't know they were drafting retards. Hey, I enlisted. We'll continue this in the field. You bet your ass. Huh. I wonder what little hunk of shit wankers are taking over our path. Hey, pal, what are you just trying to-- What's your problem? There's so much of-- I mean, women soldiers. He was wearing a bra. I just-- I am sorry about this young lads behavior. He does this whenever he sees women. His father was like this too. It was terrible to see. We think it's genetic. But since we've all met, what the hell are you doing here? [music playing] I Didn't I tell you-- we're the 110th. You're playing us in the game. Lieutenant Robin Perry. I'm a shooter. Lieutenant Harley Cole. I'm a shooter too. We have something in common. I hope so. These used to be our barracks. Enjoy them. Which bunk was yours? Now, we've got something else in common. [music playing] Nice ass. He's all yours. Maybe. Maybe not. He means the 10th. Huh? Oh. Oh. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. So, uh, who's the competition? A platoon of women. The lieutenant is a shooter. Oh, I've seen that look before. Not this look. She is something special. Ah, they're probably all dikes. Yeah, they're female dikes. Just don't let them distract you guys. We're going to check out the other team-- the Red Vipers. The Red Vipers? Oh, jeez, old man, the Red Vipers. What are they doing here? Hey, everybody blows up in the end. Not these guys, Detonator. They cleaned up in Nam and Grenada single handedly. They ain't human, and they've been trying to prove it ever since. Let's go. Let's check. Let's [snap] scope out the scene. Is this where the party is? I'm Major Lana Lush, commanding officer of the 110th. Women? We're playing women? They threw us in to satisfy the flat-chested feminists. They know we're going to lose. Oh, could you uh get me another drink? Mine ran out. Of course. You're kind of cute. About as cute as a rat's afterbirth. Woof! Marion. Why are you here? To win the games. [music playing] [gunfire] Good shooting, cowboy. That's Mr. Cowboy. Can I just call you mister? Just call? I think I've got your number. Listen, there's a little bar off base called Shooters. Oh, that's appropriate. We go there just about every night. Maybe you'd like to join me for a drink. I'd just like to see you out of uniform. [gunshot] What the hell was that? Ohhh. ROBIN: Where'd you shoot from? Over there. I've been watching you. Generally, people have to pay to watch me, pal. Check this out. Whoa. That's big. Magnetic trigger, modified barrel. Can I try it? Well, generally I prefer the old fashioned way. Well, uh-- I got to get back to, uh-- to uh-- Robin about the bar tonight. Yeah, if I go out, I'll see you there. Here, like this. [gunshot] RICKI: Hi, Harley. The usual? I told you that was over with. Nah, just get us some drinks. Relax man, she'll be here. I've seen you this antsy. Me? Antsy? I'm just trying to find her to spare her the anxiety of me being here and her not knowing it. [whistle] Well, you're a new face. What do you want? Uh, I'll uh, have whatever he is having. Tequila and cherry juice. COLE: Hi, baby That's Mrs. Baby. [inaudible]. Ladies. Oh. The drinks. What are you drinking? Beer. It's beer all the way around. [inaudible]. Ricki? Give me about two minutes, and you guys come on up. I'd love to. You have no idea how much I want to. But I can't. He'd never let me. I feel like such a prisoner. I'm so afraid of him. He said he was much stronger than you-- that you were a fag. A fag? A fag?! What? Oh, honey, why do you always do this to me? Why don't you leave me alone and let me lead my own life? [groan] Hey, watch out. What? Come on. You're coming with me. Come on. Men, can't live with them. Can't shoot them. That's $12.75. What? $12.75. He didn't pay for your drinks. You know, Carly. I guess we do now. Here. Thanks. Hey, thanks. [rooster] Welcome to the first day of competition of the 26th annual war games. What do we do? This competition is shooting. We're sunk. Listen, I can get him out. Yeah, you and whose army? Hey, we're in the the Army. Animal, shut up. ZIP: I wish you all godspeed. You know, Deputy, after this night we've had together, I feel like we've felt a special bond. Now, if you could find a way to let me out. I can't do that. Why you've got to let me out. You don't understand. We're involved in these war games. Oh, I do understand. It's hurting me to have you here. I put a lot of money on you guys-- everybody does. Money? You're betting? Shh. Yeah. Money is going down in every booking shop in the county. The Vipers are favorites to win. Everybody here knows you're the best shot. Here you sit in my jail-- shoot. Today we'll be scoring for marksmanship. Tomorrow, we'll score for the most kills in general battle. And the last day of competition, most points are awarded to the team that captures the flag on the hill. [inaudible]. What if we don't? - You should relax and enjoy it. So what if we don't win? What are they going to do? Fire us? And supervising the games, I'd like to introduce General Makepeace. [applause] And Major Wolf. Commanding the Vipers. ZIP: And Major Lush. [applause] That is all for now. Let us have exciting and successful games. And may the best team win. [whistle] [music playing] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [applause] [gunshot] [applause] [gunshot] Ball busters. ANNUONCER: Lieutenant Perry from the 110th, 75 points. Yeah, right. ANNOUNCER: Lieutenant Buck Nelson. Go get them, Bucky. You're out of here. What? [music playing] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] Yeah! ANNOUNCER: Lieutenant Buck Nelson-- a perfect score, 100 points. Yes! Maybe we can stop. Maybe Harley will be here. Forget it. Take this. Now, there's no way Farley is going to show. So you're up, Animal. It's the rules. Animal? Providence, Animal-- providence has decided to shit on me. Now, you take that rifle, and you go out there and blow the piss out of those targets. And don't fuck up, or I'll see to it that you don't get any food for a week. Godspeed, man. We're dead. Don't worry. I'm taking care of everything. [music playing] [explosion] [explosion] Get down! [explosion] [explosion] [explosion] This is the worst day of my life. I don't know what else could fucking-- [music playing] Care for a drink, sugar? Well, I felt pretty jilted last night. At least after today, I don't feel alone. You let your men down too. I don't even know that woman. Right. I've heard about you. Oh, from a girl with a mohawk. Look, can't you see what's going on here? It was a set up. They wanted me out of the game. You're saying the games are rigged. Why? I don't know why. I just know I was set up last night. I want to believe you. What the hell am I talking about? Why don't I believe you? Shit. I don't even know you. You're just some other guy. [music playing] I've never felt this before. Like what? Like a winner. Do you know what this evening has shown me? There's a time for everything. Maybe my men can win these games. Against the Red Vipers? Wolf has dogged me even back to the academy. I thought I had him once, and I caught him cheating on his exams. He got the Red Vipers. I got stationed here. I don't understand. He must have friends in high places. It's all who you know. You know me. Want to go a second time? Yeah, Mark, yeah. I really appreciate it, man. Hey, of course you're in my will, and curse you for that morbid thought. [laugh] I found out that, uh, all the bookies from here to hell and back have seen a lot of action on these games. All the money's on the Vipers to win. I guess they make a pretty good bet, huh? Yeah, what do you mean? He means the Vipers are going to win. I already lost it for us today. Animal, no self pity. I'm surprised at you. Vipers are wimps. We're going to win this thing. Sure, we might have lost some points today. We've got two days of quasi battle ahead where it doesn't matter about some pansy scoring match, and how's your form, and I'll just mark it on my little, wimpy clipboard. No. No. What matters for the next two days is how many you kill and who takes the hill. We're sunk. I cannot believe what I'm hearing. Detonator, how many different ways can you figure out how to blow up the wrong thing? Huh? Animal, who in his sleep ripped through a 4-foot locked freezer door, looking for cranberry sauce, because he was dreaming it was Thanksgiving? Guys, guys-- we've spent more time and used more smarts trying to figure out how to get out of work than the whole rest of the Army used in the last six wars. Yeah, I'll tell you what, I've got $300 here that says we're going to win this thing. And I'm taken it to the shooters back room tonight and putting it down and us to win. Who else is in? MEN: Yeah, all right, yeah. All right, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am in. I am in. All right. [chatter] [music playing] Hey, hey, Ricki-- Ricki. Oh, I'm glad to see you too. I'll have a brain tumor in draft. Ha, is it safe to serve you tonight? Oh, and who was that little blonde troop treat you were romancing last night, huh? None of your beeswax. I know. I know. I guess I just want it all. I want to go in the back room. You know, Eddie doesn't want US military back there. He doesn't want any hassles for the MPs. Tell Eddie I'm not in uniform, and I've got 3,000 US military dollars I want to lay down. [whistle] Shit. I'll lay down for half that. You'll lay down for nothing. Whoa! Oh, my god. Back off. Stay. No, please, I'm sorry. I wanted to explain and apologize. I went to the Sheriff's today, but you'd already left. To tack on robbery and rape charges? I mistook you for my husband. How long have you been married? I've had a lot to drink, and I suffer the heartbreak of PMS. Very sorry. It seems more like BS to me. Well, I've got some business to go attend to. No, wait. Finish your beer. Why don't you watch this for me? That's odd. I feel really weird. Why don't we take another sip of beer? [music playing] [chatter] Hey, schmuck. [car horn] Damn. [groan] Guys! Guys! [inaudible] lock the door. Ah! Oh, excuse me. [music playing] Is someone here? Hello? Hey, I was confused. We have to live there, all right? But it had to be done. I knew you guys couldn't handle the job. So it fell to me. I think that right here in Fort Lepter tonight, I single handedly elevated the panty raid to the mythic status of sublime performance art. All right! Right. Yeah! [inaudible]. Now, you guys get some sleep. We got us some war games to win tomorrow. Is everything else all right? MacArthur was never in a better positioned on the eve of battle. Now, go. Good night. [explosion] You're dead. What do we got? Mortars came from thataway. Oh, then the sensible thing to do is to, uh, go that way. How are doing? Not bad. Keep your head down. Stay low. OK? OK. Phasers on stun. Let's move out. [gunshot] [gunshot] Flash, you're dead. Medic, these guys are out. Get them to the hospital. Relax. You're going to be all right. Nurses love that shit. (SINGING) I'm a Leper. You're a Leper. He's a Leper. She's a Leper. Wouldn't you like to be a Leper too? Be a Leper! I am a Leper! Be a Leper. I am a Leper! SERGEANT: Be a Leper. TROOPS: I am a Leper. SERGEANT: Be a Leper. TROOPS: I am a Leper! SERGEANT: Be a Leper. TROOPS: I am a Leper! SERGEANT: Be a Leper. TROOPS: I am a Leper. SERGEANT: Be a Leper. TROOPS: I am a Leper! Major Zip, [inaudible]. They're killing everybody. They're maniacs. Shut up. Major. Come here. [explosion] Incoming! [explosion] Nice. Good eyes. We've got to make it to that target. Intelligence report. With these two already, got one left-- let's save it. All right, Plato, take the men and scout that way. Animal, pull out your radio, and stick with me. Stay low. I don't understand. What am I going to lose? General, for the men and myself, this was our chance to show the Army. GENERAL MAKEPEACE: That you can follow orders. You know, there are worse missions than running Fort Lepter, Major. Now, these orders come from a higher authority than I. Back to your command post and see to it that the Vipers win. But, Sir-- Or you'll lose. [music playing] Ah-oh. [explosion] [groan] I'm dreaming. You can't be dreaming. You're dead. Sorry about this. COLE (ON RADIO): Beaner Weiner Command, this is Yo Papa. This is Harley Cole coming to you. Where are you guys? I'll trust you guys to turn yourselves into the officials. We got to jam. [kiss sound] War is hell. Damn, they've eaten it. Put that away, and pick up your rifle. It's up to us now. This is Lieutenant Cole calling command post. Come in. It's Lieutenant Cole, sir. Yes, Charlie, come in. Just me and the Animal left here, sir. We're at coordinates 0905 and 20. We can see the objective from here, sir. Can you give me one last IR for clear sailing to the target? Yes. Lieutenant, you have a straight shot to the southwest. Well, Animal, it's just you and me left. We're going to have to scare them. Give me a mean look. Yes, [yell]. [yell]. No, no, ah, meaner. [yell] [yell] [yell] [yell] Oh, no, you're too pretty. Give me your pack. [yell] A werewolf? Some kind of animal. Seems to be coming from there. [gunshot] [scream] [yell] [gunshot] [gunfire] [scream] [yell] [gunfire] Oh! [yell] COLE: Hey, pretty boy. [gunfire] ROBIN: It was a good game. Let's eat. It's official-- we're in last place. The only chance of winning is taking that flag tomorrow. I could have sworn the two Vipers that shot us this afternoon had already been killed this morning. Yeah, well, they all look alike, don't they? Excuse me, Major. Back there. When you gave your troops instructions, you gave them incorrect information. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. Did not. Of course you did. You're drunk. Not drunk enough. Well, maybe you made the bet, but you just don't remember. No, I never made it to the back room. I mean, somebody took it, and it's gone. You know, I've been involved in a lot of bizarre shit in my life, but I never, ever let anyone down like this. You ever hear of Midnight Auto Supply? That's it. We're probably $200, $300 short. - Don't let the guys go to sleep. When I get back, I want to talk to them. There's been some cheating going on. That'll do it. Cash to spare? Cash to spare. Want me to come with you? Hold down the fort. Good luck. What's this? - Vodka. - No, thanks. It'll smooth out the day. Really, no thanks. You were going to show me how you modified the action on this thing. Yeah, I'll show you this action. Then I'll show you some real action. Hey, mister, you have the wrong idea about this. So what is your idea? WOLF: Bucky! I'll be back. Right here, $3,800? Shit. At 10 to 1 odds, if you win this thing, this whole club could be yours. Don't worry, Eddie. We'll keep going for a smooth transition. You'll know better than anyone we can hire how to clean this place up. Listen, pal, the smart money all across the country is on the Vipers. You guys can't win. Eddie, nice tie. Sucker bet. [harmonica] Oh, for god's sake, Detonator. You're ringing my plate. I can't believe it. Anybody have a guitar? I mean, here we are on the eve of battle sitting around a fire, and nobody-- Where's Harley? He's in town taking care of somthing. Yeah, we're, uh, we're waiting for him. He should be back in, oh, about five minutes. Listen, he was set up. We knew that. Mind if we wait here with you guys? Not if you don't mind if Detonator plays the harmonica. [harmonica] You again? [groan] You're getting better at this. No one wants to hurt you. Oh, I must have misunderstood. We just want you out of the game. We want the Vipers to win. Why? It doesn't matter. General-- I mean, we are prepared to offer you $10,000. What? The General? Make peace? Ha! What did he squirrel away all his money in a Swiss bank account betting on the Vipers? Yeah. What? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life. What a stupid plan! Why don't you sell arms to the Iranians or something? [groan] Because he didn't think of it. [groan] [siren] [howl] Was that a wolf? No, it was definitely a dingo. Not a dingo. A dingo ate my whole family. No? Yes. Oh. Plato. What time is it? Almost 06-- almost 60 hundred-- it's about 6:00 AM. Shit. Where's Harley? He's not in his tent. Something's happened to him. Let's not panic. Look, you guys get ready for the games. Report to the command post. Plato and I-- we'll go see the Major. What has happened to my Jeep? This time, you've gone too far. Sir, it's Lieutenant Cole. He's disappeared, and we think the Vipers are involved. Sir? You two report to the games, and I'll look into this. I know, but sir-- That's an order. Yes, sir. So what's up? Well, nothing. I think I should go find them. You guys are down to two men. She's right, man. Besides, there's still some time. Lieutenant Cole is being held in jail by the Sheriff until the games are over. So you needn't concern yourself any further. And I don't like this resistance I'm getting from you, Marion. You and I go back a long way. And I never even thought I'd see this germ of character in you. I'll tell you what-- I'll promote you to lieutenant colonel if the Vipers win. Lieutenant colonel? Lieutenant Colonel Zip. Sounds good, doesn't it? Yes, sir. Now, off with you. Colonel? Well, until this thing is over-- Look, I've been thinking-- we've got to combine forces and work together if we want to beat the Vipers. ANIMAL: Yeah, especially if they're cheating. Any word on Harley? He's in jail. There's nothing you can do. The Sheriff isn't going to let him out. You men are just going to have to do the best you can without him. ANNOUNCER (ON SPEAKER): Starting positions, everyone. Good luck. Andy-- Get his gear. [music playing] Cheers. It is a nice day for your men to die, huh, Major? Don't be so sure, sweetie. The Major here is on a winning streak. He'll never be a winner. You were destined for this station in life, Major. I am the Wolf. You-- you're Zip. GENERAL MAKEPEACE (ON SPEAKER): Morning, troops. Good morning, General Makepeace. GENERAL MAKEPEACE (ON SPEAKER): As it stacks up today, whoever takes the hill will win the games. Let me say now that winning is secondary. What is important is that for these two days, the participating units have come together in a spirit of brotherhood and cooperation. And now, let the games begin. [gunshot] This is the campfire girls. Come in, guys. We read you. What's up? SOLDIER (ON RADIO): All set to wipe out the Vipers? Wipe them out? We're going to send them alive and nail them to a tree. SOLDIER (ON RADIO): Did you read me, Buck? Talk to you later. Bye, bye, Bucky. [guns cocking] [music playing] Move out. Well, even if you are Harley Cole's sister, I usually only let attorneys in to see the prisoners. [sobbing] Oh, look, all right, I'll let you see him, but only five minutes, OK? Mhm. Oh, man. Booby trap. It must have been set up last night. Hey, Archie. [music playing] It's got to be the Vipers-- those fuckers. Sergeant, they're cheating. Can we cheat too? I came prepared. You're going to kill them? Just scare them a little. You mean you've got this far. You've got no way get me out. Look, well, I thought this took some guts. It did. Yeah, well, I just thought that-- You just thought that you would just take it as far as you could go and leave it up to old Harley to figure something out. Well-- Well? Just this one last time. [inaudible] you guys. You got a hairpin in that thing? - Yeah. Yeah. Unzip, would you? Go ahead. Here. [laugh] [music playing] [explosions] Come here! OK, get out of here. I'll hold him off as long as I can. Go. We'll have the Vipes in no time, Major. How do we look to the hill? Major? Major? You keep saying it's hell here. You know what I think? I think it's hell in here. Be the man I know you can be. Ah, guess Wolf was right. You're not a winner-- just Zip. I'm sorry. I'm drunk. Yes, you are. Thank you. Plato, your Vipers have been cheating. You're going to have to take a shortcut to win this one. Head out to coordinates 18 and 36. Check. All right! We got them. [music playing] [gunfire] Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah! Heart rate up? Check. Vision blurred? Hands clammy? Scared shitless? Check, check, check. Good. Let's go. [music playing] [alarm] COLE: Let's go. Come on! Push some buttons. Which button? I thought you were a flyer. I said want to be. All right, now, give it some power. Right. [music playing] [engine start] Pull up on something. Pull up? What? What? You're flying. Yes! Yes! [siren] ANDY: Whoa! Whoa! [siren] Whoa! Whoa! COLE: Yee haw! Oh, push it. Oh. This is going to be fun [music playing] [yell] [gunfire] Oh! [yell] [gunfire] [scream] [gunfire] Steer them left. Let's mop up. [music playing] [helicopter] Yeah! Watch out! Yes, yes! [siren] Look. [gunfire] Holy shit. [gunfire] Create a base, and move, kid. ANDY: I'm trying to hold it steady. COLE Get off here. We'll veer to the left. Adios! Ha, ha, ha! [siren] Damn! Come back here. Shit! [tires squealing] SOLDIER (ON RADIO): General, the Vipers are killing the competition. They are getting close to the hill. [gunfire] Major! Major! It's all over here now, Major. These guys really aren't human. [gunfire] [gunfire] [groan] [gunfire] [groan] Yee haw! It's the cavalry. Yee haw ha, ha! Who's shooting? Over there. [gunfire] [groan] [gunfire] [groan] [gunfire] Look, it's Buck. Yeah, he's heading for the hills. Go after him. He's getting away. Go after him. I'm trying. I'm trying. [laugh] Major! Major! They just flew over. It's him. It's Harley. He's wiping them out. All right, baby! Son of a bitch. [slam] Oh! What the hell are you doing? Are you nuts? [groan] So that's the way you like it, creep. [thud] Yes. [music playing] All right, pretty boy. Let's see who the best shot is. I am, asshole. [gunshot] [groan] [thud] [groan] [thud] [groan] [thud] That's it, Harley, it's over. Stop. Come on. What? Do you want a shot too? [thud] [groan] It's all yours, ma'am. What do you want? [music playing] Want to go for a ride? Only if you're flying, cowboy. [music playing] Here's your keys, ma'am. Sir. [explosion] Hey, everybody blows up at the end. [music playing]
