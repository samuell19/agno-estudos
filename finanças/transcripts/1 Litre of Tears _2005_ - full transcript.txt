(14 years old, Summer) Oh no. Good morning. You're running late. I know. What a large mouth. I have a large mouth. I'm digging in. I'm heading out. Take care. Hurry up, Sis. Wait up. -We are heading out. -Take care. -We are heading out. -Take care. Go. We are leaving. Good morning. A Litre of Tears Who is that? Did you forget something? What's the matter? What happened? I fell. You look great. Is it alright? Let me look at the front. Are you alright, Sis? Look. Oh my! It looks painful. Do I look like a criminal? A little bit. You are so mean. Hey are you girls ready? I'm leaving first. Let's go or else Hiroki will leave without us. Okay, let's go. We're going. We are leaving now. Aya, I have something to tell you. It's just a cut. She'll be okay. Thank you. However, we would instinctively break the fall with our hands. But your daughter didn't even hurt her hands which means that she landed on her chin. I suggest that you take her to a specialist for a check up. Aya, I think it's better for you to go for a check up. Your health isn't as good as before. And you don't walk steadily. Have you noticed that? I thought about that when you hurt yourself. I was very worried. Perhaps it's because your exams are approaching and you are stressed. So let's go for a check up, alright? It'll be good if nothing's wrong with you and... I don't have to worry about you. Okay. You are right. I'll go. Ako's waiting. Go join her. Take care. Goodbye. Take care. Can you try touching your nose with your left hand, then your right with your eyes closed? Okay. Now try standing on one leg like this. Try it. Thanks. Please take a seat. We'll perform a CT Scan on her. Alright. A CT Scan? Don't worry, it won't be painful. It's done so that we can examine your brain by sections. Sections? I'm starving. It's finally over. Mom... The CT scan was fun. Really? I felt like I was in a space shuttle. You don't get to do this often. It's fun. Right? I'm starving. This is the cerebellum. You can see that it shrunk slightly Balance, coordination and simple reflexes are controlled by the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. Your daughter is suffering from spinocerebellar ataxia. It is a genetic disorder of the neurons in the brain and it will eventually be destroyed eventually. So... what will happen to Aya? She is unsteady and clumsy right now and she will be giddy at times. When her condition deteriorates, she won't be able to walk or stand. She will also lose the ability to speak and move. Eventually, she will be bedridden and have pneumonia. But doctor, she can undergo a brain surgery, right? She can be cured, right? You have to help her. Please. If she needs to have a brain or spinal cord surgery, I'll do my best to pay for it. The cause of this disease is still unknown, so there is no available cure. But her condition won't deteriorate right away. It will worsen slowly, maybe in a year or two, or it may only happen 10 years later. Aya, we have to visit the hospital frequently in the future. Don't worry. A monthly visit won't affect my high school entrance exam. My Lord, I'm still young. I have many unaccomplished dreams in life. (15 years old, Spring) Congratulations! During your high school years, you will have many experiences. I know. Also, you have to come here during your exams. Although you're fine right now, you are a little unstable when you walk. Not being able to move normally limits your daily activities. You may be upset because you are different. But we always have to live with some difficulties in life. Doctor, even though I'm sick, I don't feel unfortunate. So, this is gift for being able to get into high school. It's a diary. Thank you. Start writing in it today. Writing helps to sort out your thoughts. Writing down your worries and doubts makes you feel better. So, it'll also help me figure out what to do in the future, right? I loved to write when I was a kid. And I asked Mom to buy me a diary before. As much as I'd love to write in it, I always forgot. Really? Writing is a good thing. But you have to keep it up. In fact, I made it to the university because of writing in my diary. And I went to Germany for further studies. You're kidding. No, it's true. Let me tell you. When you don't understand something in books, try writing about it. It helps you understand it. Writing is really useful. So, it's all about studying after all. That's right. I guess you have many dreams in life, right? You have to study hard to fulfil them. Am I right, Mrs. Kito? Yes. Keep it up, Aya. Alright. We are going to jog today. After you return, we are going to practise dribbling. Do you understand? Yes. I can't hear you. Do you understand? Yes! Miss Kito. What about you? Miss Takahashi and Kito go for self-study in the classroom then. Let's go. It's both of them every time. Good for you. You're always cheating. Let's go. If they like to study so much, I'd love to switch places with them. She's strange. She is pretending. Don't worry about them. Right, don't take it to heart. Hey, hurry up or you'll be late! He's always doing that. Let's pace up. I'm sorry. I slowed you down. Come on, you didn't. We are friends. Thank you. Friends help each other, right? Friends help each other. But that's not it. I don't wish to have the same experiences in life as my friends. Although they give me courage, I'll lose myself if I'm too dependent on them. To me, I have no choice. (16 years old, Summer) Alright, you can get up now. Doctor, I often have cramps in my legs lately, especially in the morning. Really? Do you feel different when you walk? I feel as if I'm going to fall if I'm not concentrating. And sometimes, I choke if I eat too fast. Really? I got it. What you said was really true. Writing helps to sort out my thoughts. I write about my thoughts and things that I want to ask you. Oh really? Doctor. You have to continue writing your diary everyday. And write it down if there are any change in your body. No matter how trivial things are, I hope you can tell me. It may help in the treatment. Perhaps it can even shorten the duration of your hospitalisation. Dinner will be ready soon. We're home. We're back. Give me a hand, Ako. Blackie, I'm back. Blackie, I still didn't manage to ask that question today. Doctor, what am I suffering from? Mom, will I get well? This is my first summer break in high school. I don't want to stay in the hospital for too long. Aya, you need to pay attention to changes in your body from now on. Write them down. And tell me about everything because it can be helpful to the treatment. This may also shorten the duration of your hospitalisation. And I can only come on Sundays so you have to do your own laundry if you can. Staying in the hospital is troublesome. Rest your chin on it. The University Hospital is like a school as well. Similar to a student like yourself who is studying in school, doctors are learning everyday. They are learning? Yes, and they can help you. They do research on medicine. Some patients come here especially when they find out our doctors specialize in research for this disease. 253t Patients are books for doctors and they learn how to cure them. You said that they specialize in research? It's a beautiful day. I feel like a super star. I have a lot of meetings with many people. The nurse is like my manager who draws up my busy schedule. But I guess I can't be a super star. Because you aren't pretty enough. I think it's very tough to be a nurse. Sis, if you need anything, tell me and I'll bring it next Sunday. Really? I'd like to read... ''A Six Foot Sick Bed'' by Masaoka Shiki. I know that book. It's a good time to read, but you also need to rest well so that you can recover soon. Tell me what you think about the book after reading it. Ok. I'll finish it soon. Good. That's it for today. Thank you. Thanks, doctor. Doctor, I've always wanted to ask you something. What am I suffering from? Okay. Let me explain. You won't be able to walk or stand at some point in life. But it won't happen right away. If you continue your treatment, it'll slow down the deterioration. Doctor, thank you. Doctor, thank you for looking after my daughter. Thank you. Not at all. Aya, you have to continue writing in your diary. Okay. Thanks everyone. Doctor, despite his illness, Masaoka Shiki loved to eat. Oh really? Doctor. What is it? How much longer am I able to walk? Even if I can't walk, there is work I can do sitting down, right? What can I do? Of course there are lots of options for you. You have all my support. I'll keep looking for a cure, so you can't give up. Aya. Be careful. Okay. Thank you very much. Take care. Thank you. Apart from a student handbook for a new term, I also have another one. It's a handicapped handbook. This handbook... is telling me to admit and accept my disabilities. It's higher now. I'll be right back. Good morning. Excuse me. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I'm sorry. Come. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Don't worry, it's not going to rain. You must be Aya Kito. I'm Sachiko Watanabe. I take the same bus as you. Oh. You are sick, aren't you? Let us help you and don't worry about that. We need each other's help in life. Are you okay? The bus is here. Are you ok? Can you stand up? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you alright? She's injured. Can you stand up? Come. Thank you. Don't mention it. -Please accept it. -You don't have to. Thank you for taking her to the hospital. Thank you so much. What about this? I'll take it then. I was worried. But you should thank her. She's been a great help. She's a poor thing. She hurt her face. Madam, it's very difficult to go to school on her own if she can't walk properly. I hope this won't happen again. I can't pick her up from school because I have work. I wish I could have more time. I wish I could do a betterjob in taking care of her. Madam, you can fetch her from here after work. Why don't you ask her to wait here for you to pick her up after work? I don't think that's a good idea. My shop is right next to the school. She can rest here after class. She can do her homework here, or she can go take a nap in there when she is tired. It's a great idea. Let's do it. No, I don't want to impose on you. Don't worry about that. She has a place to go and you don't have to worry when you are at work. And I've got someone to chat with me What are you worrying about? No. So that's the deal. You come pick her up after work, alright? Okay Thank you very much. Excuse me, Aya. Can you pass me an empty box? The one for twenty dollars. This one? Thank you. Does it need to be filled up? Hello. Hello. You look much better. Thanks for your concern. Did you just ask for a week of sick leave? That's nothing to be ashamed of. Let us help you. Okay Why don't you go home? I'm waiting for her to pick me up. Really? That's great. I'll get going now. Sorry to bother you. Take care. Goodbye. Come in. Can I come in? What's up? What are you doing? I'm tearing the book apart. Tearing the book apart? We are starting on a new topic tomorrow. So you only bring the part you need to school. Won't it be inconvenient? No. You are hardworking. Hardworking? Studying is difficult, but I will work hard while I still can. Aya, keep it up. Thank you. {16 years old, Autumn} You've become signature to the shop. No, I'm not. I'm sorry that I have to ask you to help me all the time. That's nothing. I should pay you for it. I'm sorry. I wait in your shop all day. I can't take your money. Take it if she gives it to you. No. Aya is very stubborn, isn't she? God will punish me if I take her money. God will punish you? I know that I can't work anymore but there are still things that I can do. I can still help others. So I'm already very happy that I can help you. But if I take your money, God will punish me. Alright, I won't pay you then. But you can stay here as long as you want. I would treat you as one of my own children. -I want to be your child too. -I don't want you. The best part of working here is that you get food. Aya can eat as much bread as she wants. Thank you. You girls have some too. Thank you. And get some drinks too. Let me treat all of you today. Have some... what would you like? How many high school students are there? 63. What about teachers? We have 145 teachers in our primary and secondary department. What's the difference here compared to normal schools? We teach the handicapped how to look after themselves. Kito, is this yours? I think you dropped it. It's mine. Thank you. You are hardworking but you are so careless. Even if you are slow, you still need to take care of your things. Thank you, Ito. Blackie, I'm home. I'm home. Have you been good today? Should this be the way a school works? Please calm down. Am I wrong? I didn't say that. In fact, we don't have any handicapped facilities in the school. And I have discussed this with the principal. We don't have the resources to build handicapped facilities because of a student. Besides I have spoken to the government. It's difficult for us to improve the facilities right away. So, based on these circumstances, she can't continue studying in our school. I think there are other schools more suitable for her. The school just wants to kick her out, right? She needs help from friends but I know that she doesn't take it for granted. She feels sorry and she blames herself for having such disabilities. I think you are sounding too serious. Calm down. Whatever it is, I hope she can continue going to school. I don't know if she can stay until she graduates, but we'll do our best on not bothering the rest. For now, I want her to continue going to school. She also wants to do that too. Teacher, I suggest that we end here today. Let's talk about this again after we calm down. Alright. But Mr. Kito, I don't want to say this, but the students are tired of looking after Aya. I hope you understand. I'm off. You're too much. Even if she needs help, she is just a high school student. Teacher, I'm sorry. I... know that I'm a burden to others. But I want to be with them. I love going to school. I'm sorry. Aya. Only babies cry to express themselves. You are a disgrace to high school students. Do I... have to quit schooling now? I I've always felt that I've let everyone down. I'm very sorry. I can't be on the same path with others. Even if it's only a short period of time, I just want to stay with them. But I see them everyday. Why doesn't anyone tell me directly that I'm a burden to them? Well, even your teacher thinks he would hurt your feelings if he had told you directly, because you've been working hard. So are your friends. It's not that they don't want to help you anymore, or you are bothering them. They have learnt a lot from you. You are still here today because of your friends. You should thank them. Do you understand? Aya, we have to be strong in facing the next challenge. Keep it up. Hey, stop running. Quiet down. What do you want to tell me? Don't worry. You don't have to worry about going to a special school. Do you need some support? Although... Although I don't want to go, I... I know that I have no other choice. Let's sit down. That's right. Although it's easier said than done, don't regret it. I won't regret it. It's my decision. Your own decision. It's very important. If you chose it yourself, no matter how difficult it is, you have to work hard to overcome it. I know you can do it. I left school to live my life as a handicapped person. I want to be independent and live on. I can be so cool about this because I've cried a lot. It takes me a litre of tears and I guess there'll be more in time to come. Hang in there. My tears. (16 years old, Winter) Saori, Yuko and everyone. Thank you very much. I'm very happy. Thank you very much. Aya, we... can't do much for you. We are very sorry. Don't say that. You've all helped me a lot. We want you to stay. Me too, but I have no choice. Sister Sachiko, Take care. Thank you for taking care of me. Goodbye. Take care. Pass me the flowers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Aya, look. Really? This is a parting gift then. It's some bread. Do you want to have it now? Are you hungry? People are like that. We don't want to be sad or unhappy. We'll be hungry after all. Eat and we'll survive. Have some. You are always welcome here. Till then, I will pay you. Don't forget about me. I'd love to see you here again. Hey, is there chilli in there? No. You're teasing me, Auntie. You are making me cry. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. Come. Let's go, Aya. Take care. Thank you very much. Are you eating or crying? Thank you. Thank you very much. (16 years old, Spring) Morning. You are up already? Morning. Kito, you are too slow. From tomorrow onwards, you just take care of the towels and rubbish. Do you understand? Yes. Thank you. We've finished. We've finished. Thank you. Let's go back. It's already late. Teacher. Good morning. Morning. It's a beautiful day. That's right. The sky is beautiful. It's a beautiful day in May. Good morning. Good morning, Miss Kito. Morning. I wish that there were an escalator. Teacher. You have to walk even if it's difficult. We are humans so we walk. Don't be late. Not being able to move isn't an excuse. You have to be punctual no matter what happens. Hurry up. Hurry. Leave some space. Be careful. Are you alright? Practice makes perfect means that you need to revise your work whenever you get a chance. But not just once though. Revising your work repeatedly should be your attitude in class. ''Practice makes perfect'' not only means that you have to revise your work continuously so that you'll be good at it. It also applies to what you are doing everyday in taking care of yourselves. Practice would make it perfect too. I'm Kito. I've made an appointment to borrow a book. The library is closed. But... You should have come earlier if you want to borrow books. I'll get it for you tomorrow, alright? Miss Kito? Stand up, Miss Kito. You can't cry here. Do you understand? (1 8 years old, Autumn) Burn... Keep on burning... Don't vanish, carry on burning. I feel good. My costume won't be the same as the other ones like that. It's definitely going to surprise everyone. Let them know how difficult it is to make the background. But, those are only our costumes. You said you want to make your own too. At the finale, people who aren't doing anything have to come on stage and sing along together. That includes Jun and me. I said no and I mean it. Why can't I help her? How do you know you can't manage without trying? Do it yourself. It's part of your training. You always say that. You want to turn us into an army or what? She came to me for help. Please try to understand how others feel. Alright, don't say it anymore. No. Right. You help her out of sympathy. That's not good for her. You give up without even trying. You can't be like that. What do you normal people know? Anyway, our bodies will fail one day and we won't be able to look after ourselves. After we leave this place, the society and normal people won't understand us. You are right. We won't understand you. But nothing's going to change if you always rely on others for help. Am I right? Are you okay? That evil principal refuses to tailor the costumes for us again. Can we do it ourselves? We shouldn't have asked her in the first place. Teacher, thank you for lending us the paint and brushes. Thank you. You girls have made a pretty good background. You girls are hardworking. Thanks. Are you okay? I'm starving. Let's go make some food. They'll scold us if we are too late. Look, it's Emiri. Oh yes. Emiri, you are still working on it. Let's go back together. I still have something to do. You girls go ahead. I've said that there are no excuses for not doing anything in class. How could anyone go forward in life if she can't even be punctual for dinner? Wait a minute. Where are you going? I'm going to look for them. Atsuko is very independent. She doesn't care that she's handicapped. She argues with everyone. I want to be like her. She's very strong. I'm envious of her. I'm envious of her but she's quite difficult. She's quite difficult to be with, don't you think so? Well... She's a little. Am I right? If she is more understanding, it'll be easier to be with her. What are you doing? We are... I knew that you girls are here. I'm sorry. I made them stay with me. Did she scold you? I don't understand you girls. You want to sew this on? Atsuko. Four heads are better than three. Burn... Keep on burning... The mountains and trees are covered with snow. There are many fruits on the trees. Burn... Keep on burning... Don't varnish and keep on burning. The bees keep honey in the beehives. There's lots of honey. The field is filled with wheat even during winter. Burn, burn. Don't varnish and keep on burning. Burn... burn... Don't varnish and keep on burning. Well done! It's a great show. Thank you, everyone. Well done. You did well. We did it. We did it even when we are sick. All of us did it. We see other people do it all the time and now, we did it ourselves. Congratulations! You did very well. Thank you. Miss Sato, Thank you very much. We did it all by ourselves. That's awesome. Congratulations. All of you did a great job. (19 years old, Summer) Mom. What's up? Mom smells great. Aya. You sound softer recently. Is it because you are alone at home? No. I sound the same. Listen... I'm worried. Your lungs would become smaller if you don't speak. Should I quit my job? No. I don't want you to quit yourjob. But Aya... When I was in high school, I wanted to go to the university. After I graduate, I wanted to be like you, working in a job that can help others. Really? When I went to the special school, I got up earlier than others. I got up at 4 a.m. because I wanted to study and go to university. I know. Although I'm weak, I want to contribute happily to the society. Really? But when I graduated, I couldn't even do it. Mom. What's up? Excuse me. Alright, take it easy. Keep going. Very good. Take it easy. Very good. Very good. Take it easy. Keep it up. Since you got sick, you couldn't work. What can you do? What kind of tasks can you do? You can still write. Sis. You like to write. You can still write. That's yourjob. Your work is going to help others someday. So don't be lazy and keep on working. Look. It's a beautiful day. I feel great. Let me lend you some books. What would you like to read? What do you have? Let me think. Dr. Kobayashi. Aren't you supposed to be attached to the surgical department? Hey... I just come over. I've finished my class and you are still here? You both get along well. Doc, this doctor... says that he loses his way in the hospital again. Really? It's more convenient to come and ask Aya. Sorry to bother you, Aya. He's still learning to be a doctor. Please forgive him. I'm sorry. I'll make a move now. Huh? Doc? -What's up? -How do I get to the surgical department? (Where is the surgical department?) Go find it yourself. He's silly. He's funny. That's right. How are you feeling, Aya? You aren't a student anymore. Now you... can keep me company. As long as I'm still a doctor, I'll look after you. Okay. Aya. How are you? Actually, I'm on my way to see you. What's up? These flowers are nice, aren't they? They are for you. Thank you. But why are you giving me flowers? I need to act fast. What do you mean? Perhaps you don't know about this. Do you know that you have lots of admirers in the Rehab Centre? I don't. Well... Do you know the old man who is recovering from stroke? The one who grunts all the time. He comes here because of you. Really? Of course. Your hardworking spirit encourages us to keep going. And that old man is one of them. These are for you. Thank you. Can I bring them to your room? Let's go. Thank you. They are really pretty. Who are they from? The people from the Rehab Centre gave them to me. Really? Great. Do you still write in your diary everyday? Only when I remember. Writing is a form of therapy too. I want to be like my mom. I want to work in a job that can help others. But... You love to write, don't you? My mom asked me the same question before. Really? Doc, do you have any siblings? I have a brother but I've always wanted a younger sister. He is now running a hospital for my father. Where is it? In your hometown? In Echigo-Yuzawa. Do you know that place? It's also known as the snow country. It snows a lot in winter. That's great. You get lots of snow. Slowly. Take it easy. Oh, be careful. Take it easy and keep going. My hand can't move properly. Really? Your hand will cramp if you are too forceful. And it won't be able to move. Aya, don't worry and do it slowly. Good. Keep going. Doc. It's good to see you here. You have to be good or you'll become like her. I want to sit in that too. Don't be foolish. You can't walk or run if you become like her. I'm sorry, wheelchair. I didn't charge your battery properly. You can't move anymore. Doctor. Aya, how are you? You are working hard in the rehab centre. Yes. It's tough though. Doctor? What's the matter? Doctor, am I be able to get married? I don't think so. Why... why? Is my disease hereditary? You won't be able to recover. Your condition would only worsen. Therapy helps to delay it. They help stimulate the brain. I'm looking for experts who know about your disease. Doctor, thank you for telling me the truth. Thank you. Aya. We are back. I am back. Welcome back, Sis. Please take care of the luggage. Okay. Aya, the doctor says that even though you are much better now, you have to be careful if you have a fever. It could be quite troublesome if you catch a cold. Let me bring these in first. Aya, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm alright. Really? What is it, that I am living for? This is your room from now on. I've put your bed here. Let me know if it's not convenient for you. Thanks, Mom. I'll tell you if I don't like it. This room is near the bathroom and kitchen. It's convenient for you. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. Are you thirsty? Hey... Hey. Hey. What's the matter, Sis? What's the matter? I'm sorry. I forgot that you aren't in school today. I'm doing my vocal training. I see. I thought something bad happened to you. You gave me a shock. I'm sorry. What's up? Thank you. Alright, if something bad happens to me next time, I'll call out like that. Don't be silly, I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Right, don't be silly. Does it hurt? Aya, you'll be pretty if I push you on this pressure point. Aya, what's wrong? My teachers and friends are very healthy. Although I'm sad, I can't be together with them. I don't think that I'm unfortunate. It's just inconvenient for me. I love going to school I love the teachers, Saori, Yuko and I love everyone in school. I love the auntie at the bakery and my mentor, Sachiko. The thing is that they have become part of my life. In the past, I thought I couldn't do anything when I'm sick. But now, I realise that I can do it if I work hard. Thank you. Aya hasn't been so motivated for a long while. It's all because of the love and care from your family. Aya is working very hard. I didn't know Mom feels like that towards me. Doctor, although I'm very sad to learn about my condition, thank you for telling me the truth. I want to live on. I can't move and I can't help others. But I still want to live. I want to feel my heartbeat. It's still beating. I'm very happy that I'm still alive. (20 years old, Spring) Are you awake? How are you feeling? I'm... feeling... fine. Really? That's good. Mom... What's the matter? Grey... hair I've more grey hair now. I was wondering what you were looking at. Aya, I'm going through what you wrote. Mom... Mom. What's up? I... still want to live... What are you talking about? You've got to hang in there. (Aya lived for another 5 years...) (She was 25 years 10 months when she passed away ) Thanks, Mom. The pretty trees shine one day The sky is soothing during sunset The clouds chase the plane in the sky Where did we come from? And where are we going? Nobody knows We can only carry on walking I'll keep loving them As if I'm spreading it to the sky My love ones I'll keep loving them I'll keep loving them I've found love My love ones are right next to me
