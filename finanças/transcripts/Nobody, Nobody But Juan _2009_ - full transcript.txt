You two behave like you're husband and wife, when you're both men! What are you, billy boys? She's mine! I can't do such a thing to you. It's Lolay here who says all sorts of things. Why me? He's right, Lolay. You're such a teaser! Juan... Juan... Don't be afraid. We won't leave each other. All of you! We won't leave each other. We will stick together until we grow old.

Uhm... are you okay, Juan? Hey! I've noticed that... lately... you haven't been... ...talking! You fell asleep again. Yeah... pardon me. It's really hard to have an illness such as epilepsy. Epilepsy is not your illness! It's Narcolepsy! It's when you fall asleep without noticing ...and instantly That's it! Eclipsy! (laughs) You know, Miting, even if you are the way you are, you entertain me, you give me joy, because you're an idiot! It doesn't matter if I'm an idiot, as long as I see you happy. What really seems to be your problem? Huh? It's hard to explain. Some other time. Does your son know about this? Hi, Dad! I have two sons here, but it's like, they're not. Ahem! Oh my God! Oh, He's notjust your God. He's our God too. Also, a father-in-law's advice, don't use the Lord's name for useless expressions. That's bad! - Ugh! Mario! Mario? My son has so many possible choices for a wife, why did he marry a witch? Hello? I'm still here! I can hear you. Heller! I'm sorry. I thought you evaporated in the air!

(door slamming) What's this again, Dad? Didn't I tell you already that nobody should watch TV? Why do have to invite, even the staff to come to your room and watch TV too? There's something I'm waiting to see. And who are you expecting? We don't have anymore relatives in the Philippines. I'm going to report this to John. Bah! You speak so highly of your brotherJohn. Let's see ifhe even says "hello" to you. Alright, guys! Thanks for coming today for this meeting and you're probably wondering why you're here. The big thing is we're doing this move to try to acquire a company. Pamela Sue is handing out a Profit & Loss of United Capital, which is this firm that we want to acquire. Go ahead! Make your ear swell and gather pus. No one will answer the phone. ...because I want to buy this company for us. But we need one thing, and that's more money. So, the meeting today is I need for you guys, after this meeting, to call your financing, and your investors to help our firm acquire this company. This company has got some big potential, and I don't wanna lose out. Here's the issue though. We don't have a lot of time. Okay? We got thirty days to raise the money, and I'm talking about a lot of money, okay, 'cause, I'm telling you, The mexican cartel, corporations called Julio's really wants to buy this project. I want it for us first. I told you so. John, you see... his role is to be busy with life. Mario! Who do you think are you talking to? That's your father! You scold him like a nobody, have a heart! Mr. Miting, I wasn't talking to you, okay? (breathes deep) Mario! Mario! What? Your wife calls you and you already tremble with fear! Be a man! Whoever is in need of you, should come to you. (snoring sound) (clapping sound) (slapping sound) (clanging sound) (screaming) If that doesn't wake you, I don't know what will... You two... you're both not doing yourjobs well. (slamming sound) This is a warning! Now get lost! Out! Get out of my sight! Clara? - What is it? - Mario, dinner's at seven. Okay. Have you told him? (whispering) I'll tell him later. Fine! I'll do it. - No, no, no, no! I'll take care of it, okay? Cla... Dad? Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Are you sure? As if I'm thrilled to be calling you "Dad" starting today, it is forbidden to watch Wowowee! (chattering) Come on, C-bear! Uhm... excuse me! Tickets please? I have a ticket here! Right here! Thank you! This is fake. Sorry! No! That could not be fake. We bought it and it has signature on the BACK. Yah! Well, even if it has a signature at the "BACK," this is still a fake. Fake at the back? We paid a hundred and fifty dollars for these! Yes! Oh, mother! You got hustled! Watching Wowowee is free! You don't pay anything! You just register to get a schedule. C-bear... Where are the guys who brought us here? Yah. We've been scammed! Scammed? Scammed! Yes, see? S-C-A-M-B... scamb! Yeah, we'll work on that, anyway... Alright... alright... you go back there and No! Don't touch my furcoat! It's leopard print, you leopard! Excuse me! Where's the driver? Driver! - Leopard furcoat... you may have dollars but you're so stupid, you fall for scams. (train trickling) (muttering sound) There! Here you go. There! You better not get the lion's share, Ribio huh! Hey! That's a fair share! There! Hey, Lolay! Scrimp and save that. There's no telling when we can hustle again. With so much we took from those gullible TFC fools, Ribio, there's a big chance they went to the police. You know, we should get inside. Do you know anyone at ABS-CBN? Are you daft? If I did then I would have been a big star since long ago. Shush! We're dead... if we can't get inside... our "business" is dead. Our scheme on... Operation Wowowee Kaput! Oh, I just remembered... how is your wife? She's still there... still loving me as much. Mario? Are you ready yet? - Yup... yup... ready! What are you wearing? A shirt. Look at me! You're trying to make me look bad! Well, what's wrong with my shirt? You look like my driver! You know, Tu... I bet nobody can make me laugh today. Well, I bet this will make you laugh. There! That's funny! (laughing) (audience laughing) Nope! Not yet? Now that's really funny! (laughing) (boisterous laughing) Not yet. Still nothing? There! That's funny! Go ahead laugh! - (audience laughing) I really can't laugh. Son, what should I do to you? How about this? Now that's really funny! (teasingly giggling) Still ain't laughing. Still ain't? For sure, this will make you laugh. There! That's really hilarious! (laughing) There! That's frightening! We better scram. - Let's get the hell out ofhere... All bets are in? Of course. What you need is that your cards shouldn't go over twenty one. If it goes over, you lose. (kissing sounds) Stop munching on my ear! I'm embarrassed to Tu. Why should you be embarrassed to Tu? You're the apple ofhis eye. Come on, Tu, show my Aida, your secret affection. Come on! Show her the look oflove! You're really something... how can you tell that he's got a crush on Aida? Well, Tu is always staring at Aida, Jesus! Well, you stare at me like I'm "lunch". I'm only avoiding you because I don't want to ruin your relationship with Aida. Lolay, I don't eat bittermelon! (gasps) Come on, show her! - Have pity on the guy. Go ahead... take Tu's side... and make his love for you grow stronger. Tu is a good soul... easy to love. (slamming sound) Dear... Aida... Well then Tu... don't you have feelings of desire for me? Hmmm? You know, Lolay, I don't fall for women who look like dried salted candy! But Tu... you can learn to love me, Hmmm? Come on... give me a chance... to prove to you... come on, come on... don't be shy... come on... Takeshi, is lunch ready? Yes! Okay. Make sure that the produce that they deliver are fresh, okay? Yes! Go check the dining area. Come on! I'm tired of this sh... What? Uh... Thank you! (groans) Mr. Miting... Mr. Miting... Mr. Miting... (clapping sound) (gasping) - Mr. Miting...

You know, what you should do, just stand here all the time. Stay by his side. He's so cute. Stay there! (chattering sound) (TV sound disappears) Nobody's supposed to watch TV! - (booing and heckling) Do you hear me? - (booing and heckling) Nobody will watch Wowowee! (booing and heckling continues) (chanting begins) Wowowee... Wowowee... Wowowee... Wowowee... Wowowee... Wowowee... - Dad, can you please make them stop? - Wowowee... Wowowee...

"Alanna"... translated in English..."no more" in Spanish..."no mas!" Dad, is this what you want? You want my wife and I to argue and fight? Our lives are already in chaos!

No eating! Wowowee! No eating! We're two different people, Mario, I want to be in the big time! I've got aspirations. I want to be in an exciting environment. And you... you're contentjust running a nursing home. Well, not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just that I don't understand why you have to be highly involved with these people's lives... and love them. This is just a business. It's my dad. Right? You just can't stand him. You want to know the truth? I'm scared you're gonna turn out exactly like him. We better go. We'll be late for our meeting. Mario. They're here! Alanna Dela Cruz! Nice to see you again! Hello Dr. Calvin and Mr. Klein! Sorry, we're late. I'm sorry, Were you waiting long? Aahh, about ten to fifteen minutes. Filipino time!

Let's fix this, Okay? - Ouch! Ouch! Recovery is faster that way! Mario, help me please! Are you okay? I want a divorce. Hey dude! Your daughter-in-law don't like it. She's like rolling her eyes and moaning wants to get out of the room! Wow! You talk with American twang! Uh huh! You've been here long? Uh huh! About two weeks. Two weeks in Chicago? Naaah huh! In the US! You've been here two weeks and you talk like that already? Uh huh! That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it! Uh huh huh, you like it! But you better be careful, the wind might blow you the wrong way. Uh huh! You take care too, 'cause I care! After a month, she won't understand Tagalog anymore. Uh huh! You see? Some Filipinos... Fine ride! All is well between you and Alanna now? Dad, I don't want to talk about it. You're becoming like Alanna, you've become too negative. Dad, please! But... Dad, please! Can we stop this? The word "please" has a different meaning here. From where we come from, it's nicer when you say, "Pass the water, please?" "Pass the rice, please?" Here? It's "PLEASE! I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO YOU!" So that's how you mean by the word here. But this ride is really mighty fine! Hey... this looks like... it's a television! Can I watch Wowowee here? - Dad, there's no cable, there's no TFC. This one... it's the sunroof, right? - Dad, don't touch that! You could get colds, it's freezing already! Spoilsport! This... what's this? - Dad, that's for the windshield, no! Don't! Don't! We're dead! I gotta go pee! License and registration, please? Uh... yes, officer. Here's my license and here's the registration. And uh... you want to tell me what happened? Uh... my... my... my father was... uh... Where is he? There he is! Hey! That's against the law! No! It's against the car! What are you doing? Uh... washing the car. Don't peep! So what you're saying is that, your father was tinkering with the dashboard, you lost your concentration, and that's why you hit the patrol car... Let me answer this. Miss beautiful... beautiful... Berne. You know, I was talking to my son, And then pressed buttons in the dashboard, and then... wha bang! The police car... come over and... uh... nature called me... I jingle-izer. Wait... what is jingle-izer? Jingle-izer is... uh..."weewee!" Weewee... - Dad, dad, uh, can you please stop talking? You're getting us in deeper trouble. Can you? Uh, can I just use the phone? I'm going to call our lawyer? Yes, you can. Thank you, Okay, Dad? Please? Wowowee! You have Wowowee here! That's my favorite show! Me, too, sir. Are you a Filipino? Of all the luck! What a coincidence! And you're eating my favorite too! Yes. How about you? Go ahead, it's okay. I have some more here. I just came from Seafood City. Why, thank you! Thank you! (TV chatting, cheering and applauding) ...now let's go to Grandma Lolay. Grandma Lolay, how are you? Hi, Will! I'm so happy! I'm so very okay, Will! Where do you come from? I'm from Quiapo, Will. Will. Wait a minute, Will! Can I kiss you? Don't bother! Oh come on, let me kiss you. I'm just kidding. She still smells good! She's still desirable! Lolay... Greet your hometown friends, where are you from again? I'm from Quiapo. From Quiapo, then greet them. Hey! My neighbors in Quiapo! I'm in Wowowee! I'm a celebrity now! To all the snatchers over there! Do your best! I have one grandson there who's one of the best snatchers in town! Grandson, don't get caught! Or we'll have nothing to eat! How old is your grandson? Oh dear... he's only twelve! Willie... the snatchers over there are requesting if they can all come and play here in Wowowee! Do you want that? (audience cheering) Maybe they should play against the police! We'll make announcements soon, grandma Lolay. Grandma Lolay, are you... what were you doing when you were younger? My name is... Lolay Baile Baile as in dance! Whoa! You know Will, I was a great dancer in my younger days! Were you a dancer... Yes, I was in a dance group before, and we danced in various places. We used to perform in... where was that again? Orient... At The Orient... and then at the... at The Clover... and uhm... The Metropolitan. And so many more! We were touring and moving back then! So that was yourjob when you were younger? Oh, there were so many of us in those days. I remember there was Nanding Poe, the father of Fernando Poe. He was our producer that time. And then, for dancing, it was Bayani Casimiro who was our Dance Director. For drama, it was Domingo Prinsipe. You know, Will, it was difficult to be an entertainer in those days, because you need to be able to do everything they tell you to do. Drama... uh... Comedy... and Musical. It's really tough! So were you a good dancer back then? I was really great back then! - So, during your time, what did you do? Can you do what Luningning does? Chicken Feed! Can you show us? Can you do it? Oops, oops... Waaaaah! (shouting, laughing, chattering, applauding) Grandma... Owen! Oh grandma... Are you okay? You're okay? Let's give her a big hand! Thank you. You're welcome! Oh, grandma, are you okay? I'm still okay, Will. How many kids do you have? Oh, I'll tell you that some other time, bacause they're so many I can't count them right now. I'm sure you had a lot of suitors before. I had a fulfilling lovelife in those days! Colorful... Do you wish to greet anybody else? Your friends? You know, we are seen in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao... and every corner of the world. Maybe you have relatives or friends abroad that you wish to greet. I remember one... Juan! Juan Dela Cruz! Hey! He's in America now. Juan! If you're watching, send some chocolates. Juan! Who is Juan? Were you lovers or friends or what? Dancing partner? Yes. He was lusting after me, but I avoided him. Why? I didn't want to ruin the group harmony. Is that so? Who else do you want to greet? I have another friend... Tu! Juan... and then Tu... Yes! They were a tandem! Juan Tu, Juan Tu, Juan Tu... You already have Juan, and you have number two also! Go greet your numer two! Hey, Turibio! Hello! So what's your talent? Oh, I'll do anything to entertain everyone watching Wowowee! Is that okay with you guys? (audience cheering) So grandma, what do you want to do? I want to dance with Owen. Owen? Owen! Okay! Go ahead, can you do it? Presenting Grandma Lolay! Maybe... How can it be that you didn't know? Lolay... Tu's dead. Worms are feasting on him for ages! What do you mean dead? He's still alive! Sigh... why is she this dumb? My Lord, is there really someone this dumb? I know now... That when wisdom and dumbness poured from the heavens, all you caught was dumbness! Lolay... your skull is filled with ashes! As ashen as your hair! Pretty, isn't it? Lolay, have you forgotten? Turibio is my name. I sliced it, and threw away the Tu. Ribio is left, so Juan couldn't find me. Then you shout it out on the Wowowee show, that the two of us were like a loveteam. What are we? John Lloyd and Sarah Geronimo? Why do you have to hide from Juan? If you don't know, don't bother to know, just forget this conversation. Whatever, whatever! But wait... what about our grand schemes? Still pushing through. I still make the plans. Once we're in, you take the lead. Sigh... she really is stupid ...stupid... stupid... Okay, fine! Don't be mad. It seems I'm getting it now. What do you mean, "it seems?" "Parang" is in the ricefields. We are in Quezon City. Old actors who have to be hustlers to survive. Indeed. That's good. That is a big boost to our future. I believe we still have a future. Don't be mad anymore. You might get a heart attack. Cheers! To your stupidity, Lolay! I'm just hungry, I was a wise when I was a kid. Oh, Uncle John's here! You mujst be hungry! He wants to eat with you! I made a bundle, Madelyn! Yes. Oh! By the gods, by the saints! Why are you not eat? Why are you not eat... Teach her later. Hey dad! Hi! Hey bro! Why aren't you eating? You aren't either. You're always on the phone. Hey, listen. I'll call you back okay? My dad and my brother are here. Anyway, you know what, I have to go. Alanna is waiting for me. Hey, Mario... I hope you have more patience for what happened. If you and Alanna are thinking that... I'm screwing up the home with everything I do... you're mistaken. Truthfully, I'm actually trying to help you. I'm trying to bring joy to all your patients there. The thing is, when we're watching Wowowee, we were all joyful. So why do you have to take thatjoy from us? Don't you know that we, at the home, are living on borrowed time? Maybe years... months... days... left. Why prevent us from watching Wowowee? That's when we're joyful. Let us be joyful. And... the reason I watch Wowowee... the feeling I get when I watch it... is like I'm in the Philippines. And it feels so good. That's why both of you, don't ever forget, in your hearts, by your blood, you're still Filipinos! Remember that. I'm not the only one who decides there. Alanna and I make the decisions. And that's what's wrong! It's your family business. You're the head of the family. You're the one who should decide. Nobody, nobody but you! Dad, excuse me. Here are Dad's things, his passbook, and his passport. He's cranky because what? Well, I forbid him, and the other residents from watching Wowowee. Wowowee? The show? Yup. I remember that show from two years ago. Yah! Which means you haven't seen Dad for two years, what a great son you are. Hey, you're always with him, but you're always fighting. I'm not the one he's fighting with. It's Alanna. How is she, by the way? I'm gonna go, okay? Mario... are you alright? If you need anything, just ask me. What do you mean,"if I need anything?" What do you mean... help in what? Opening your own thing. Look, I'm pretty much set up. Sure? Look, just because you have more than I do, doesn't mean I have nothing. Mrs. Sanders? Mr. Dorne? Where is everyone? Why aren't they here? Julie? Chiruwa? Randy? Mario... Mario... I couldn't find the elders! They're gone! Gone with the wind! Gone too soon! What do you mean, "gone too soon?" Where would they go? I don't know. I cannot find them. This can't happen... Mr. Mario! Miss Julie! Hide us! Are you alright? (commotion) Hi, officer! Oh! Oh! Oh, Hi! How are you? I miss you! We were high school classmates, Oh! Do you have a pistol? Are you glad to see me? It's a pistol. I'm not glad to see you. You're so funny! Oh, you have big hands! What can it do? May I speak with who's responsible here? Uh... I... I am... officer. Yes, well, I have good news! Your ID braces are pretty strong. The bad news? Mr. Miting! I'm sorry, officer. If this happens again, I'll have to revoke your license, okay? And in the meantime, I should be putting nasty fines for you. I'm so sorry, officer. Don't be upset. It will never happen again. But you can visit me. Anytime! With pistol! Without pistol! See you. I'm sorry, officer. Sorry! I need to go... need to g... M... muh... Mario... (rambling) Go back to your rooms! Now! Now! Go! What are you, two? Both of are fooling around! Where are they? Have they left? Why were you touching my ass? We don't have, papers, you see. Illegal aliens, as they say. That's why I pretended... I'm black... while he... While I... pretended to be Chinese... when in truth... I'm from Leyte. I, too... changed my name. Back then, my name was Pulong. "Pulong" translated in English is "meeting" right? That's why Miting became my name. But, wait a minute... You have to know, that we can't accept illegal aliens here. Our license will be revoked. How about you, Julie... are you also a TNT? Oh, no! Of course not! Technically, I'm not because I'm new here in the States. But eventually, I will be, If I don't marry a white man. My gosh! The callers are demanding the refund of their payments... and the others, are planning to file charges! Wait a minute, wait a minute! Please don't report us to Homeland Security! Right! Please, at least, give us a little headstart, for us lovers to run and hide. Stop! Don't shame yourselves in front of the elders. The terminal is equipped with state-of-the-art systems for information, check-in and immigration. Is there no TFC? Oh! Uh... what do you want... original or hot and crispy? TFC! The Filipino Channel!

That's perfect! Hi, Andrew! Have you had your DNA test? Mom is asking. DNA test... Andrew, I've been quite busy. I haven't had the chance yet. Are you too busy to find out if I am your son? No time forAndrew... Shut up! Don't write this down! None of your business! Not my business... Pamela Sue! Go to the car! To the car... Go! Disappear! Disappear!

But one thing did happen, that was absolutely wonderful... is we had you! And, since you're asking... you also have two other sisters... and they're not with your mother. So I have two other sisters? Yes! It's, one big happy family! You think I still care about that stupid place? Let the license get cancelled. Let the place go to hell! But you don't understand. The senior folks got out, got through the guards! And you think, that's my fault? Give me a break, Mario! Give me a break! You pay the fines. You pay the damages. You're on your own! I'm done! John, what do you mean Dad is missing? He wasn't at breakfast today. He's gone! Conchang, didn't he say anything about where he's going? I see no evil, I hear no evil, and I speak no evil, senor. Hmp! Dad's passport and passbook savings account's ...missing. Okay, thank you. Dad just made a five thousand dollar withdrawal from his passbook savings account. What's he gonna do with the money? I don't know! Don't worry about him. He survived the war. He'll survive this. Yeah... but what's he up to? I have no clue! Manila has changed a lot! I don't recognize it anymore! But... the potholes are still there. (laughing) Our roads still riddled with holes! Even people's pockets have holes! But... there are others... My gosh... their wallets are still so thick! Why does your meter seem to run fast? No it doesn't. That's normal. Remember, whatever appears on that meter will be your fare. I notice that everytime we hit a bump, your meterjumps with the bump.

We're in friendster! Your meter's really fast! Jesus, Mary, Joseph! My fare might reach ten thousand pesos! Remember, we agreed, that whatever appears on the meter is your fare. Is that so?

Old man, have you no shame? Why did you jump the line? You go in line from the back! This is your fault! I was here earlier, first in line, all alone... you told me to leave, and come back.

Hey, hold it! That's a hundred dollars! That's why I'm holding it! This should be enough. That's more than enough! Five dollars should be enough for scavengers like them. A deal's a deal.
