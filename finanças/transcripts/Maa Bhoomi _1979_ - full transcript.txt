Our Land This is Telangana. The feudal system of the Hyderabad State has occupied half of Telangana. The Nizam, a puppet of British Imperialism... ...rules this land. This is Siripuram, a village in the district of Nalgonda. Hundreds of landless peasants live here. Ramayya is the son of one such poor farmer. This story begins with Ramayya... and follows him, taking new turns. Irayya, give me a beedi. Dawdling like bridegrooms, are you! Get going. Get up! Sailu, get some water for The Master. - Hey you, Iriga! - Yes, sir. Hmm, go! Your son has grown. Starting tomorrow, send him to mind the Dora's cattle. All right. Father... - Father...? - What is it? I won't go to mind cattle. What'll you eat if you don't work? Are you a Dora's son? Look my son, you're the child of a hired hand. A hired hand's son will only ever be a hired hand. It's our fate. You must go to work, even if you're dying. How can it be otherwise... Producers: Ravindranath, B. Narsing Rao Based on Kishanchander's "Jab Khet Jage" Script: B. Narsing Rao, Gautam Ghosh, Partha Banerji O village lad, O able little cow-herd... How long ago was it since you tasted milk? Camera: Kamal Nayak Editing: D. Rajgopal O fresh-faced lad, when did you begin working? Art: T. Vaikuntham You perch on the high rock by the curving path Have you indeed become lord of the pastures? Music: Vinjamuri Sitadevi, Gautam Ghosh Does your little belly go hungry? Your tears stream down and your hands rub the eyes Why do you sob so pitifully? O my fresh-faced lad... Will you say who hurt you, little one? A measure of grain, is that all of your wage? And when you measure, is the amount even less? And when you think of it, are you overcome with grief? Director: Gautam Ghosh Hey, Rangadu! Where are you all off to? Gopayya died. - How? - I don't know. Wait, I'm coming! Oh my God! Oh, God... What have you done to me? How did Gopayya die? The cart got stuck and he fell into a ditch. The cart ran over him, and he died. A man our own age died before our very eyes... Here is Jagannath Reddy, Zamindar of all this land. He is the overlord of 50,000 acres. Earlier, all the Zamindars of Telangana... were only tax collectors. The Nizam later granted them titles and jagirs. They have seized thousands of acres since then. And all the farmers who tilled the land... ...were forcibly turned into tenants. These Zamindars took law and justice into their own hands. They became the pillars of Hyderabad's feudal system. They determine the fate of the thousands who live here. Well, how are the collections, Lakshman Rao? Almost over. Only two or three still have to pay up. Why haven't they paid? How will they pay if you sit twiddling your thumbs! But I've told them... So, you told them, did you? You must hound and harass them into paying taxes! He is here, Dora (chieftain) You think bowing and scraping will do? Who'll pay the tax, you bastard! Will your wife's pimp pay? How will I pay, Dora? When I harvest the crop... Don't give me excuses, you dirty son of a whore! Think you can cheat the Nizam Government? I beg you, Dora... I'll sell what I can and pay the tax. I'll break every bone in your body if you don't pay! What is she waiting for? Hey you! Why are you dumb-struck? Speak up! What can I say...? He died, leaving me high and dry. Help my child and me! I'll serve you dead or alive. Each one to his own fate. We can't change it. Look, let the girl serve the Mem Sahib in the Gadi. And you can get by on daily wage somewhere. I told you to bring me those papers. Are the pots good? How many? You've brought less! No need for all that. Hey Iriga! Come here. Get going! Go on! What are you standing for? Get going! Today is the fair! You talk big, you little bastard! A coolie whore-son wants to enjoy the fair? You dare to hit me? Go! I won't follow. Think new clothes make you a Dora, you thieving bastard? You dare attack him? Come on, get going! Go! Please, sir. He's only a boy. Don't take him amiss. What else can he do but serve the Dora! He has to live by the Dora's grace. Please don't be angry! Come on, you! - Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. How many did you bring? I brought 38, Dora. Don't stare at him! Look down! Go on, quick now! Why are you staring? Get moving! Admiring yourself like a bridegroom, are you? Get going, you whore-son! Oh village lad, Oh able little cow-herd How long ago was it since you tasted milk? Oh you fresh faced lad! I wanted to ask... How long will you put off marriage? I won't marry, Father. No, son. A home needs a woman even to light a lamp! Say what you will. I won't marry now. Father... At least drink this rice gruel. Look, son... Sit here by me. I'm old... I'm waiting for the graveyard. Not this now! Let me say it... Why don't you sleep quietly, as I said? Why don't you listen to me? Drink some gruel first. In my grandfather's time, we had some land. Only two acres of it remained in my father's day. I couldn't even hold on to that! Nor have I been able to get you married. Anyway, you know all this... Not a morsel in our belly until we work. Our lives will pass on serving the Doras. Hey Rama! You're supposed to be working, but you keep looking elsewhere! I know what's up! Don't to try to fool me. Hey Malli! Where are you off to? Come here! I'll feed my baby and come back, sir. How often do you go, you thieving bitch? I really must feed my baby. Please, I'll be right back. You're saying you really have milk? Let me see! Okay. Go, you bitch. Come back before this spit dries up! Oh! It's Ramulu. Hey, Ramulu! How are you? I'm doing fine. What dowry did you get? Ah, what can poor folk give? They just gave the girl. It's up to me to look after her. It's a pretty girl you married, Ramulu Bhaiyya. Pretty, isn't she? Well, Ramulu! That sure is one pretty wife you have! Eh? Wonderful! That's some fine stuff, Pratap Reddy Sahib. It's all by your grace, sir. Mastan, get another glass for the Sahib! You know about this Sangam? There's a lot of talk about it nowadays, I hear. Sangam! Here, in our area? Who will dare do it here? Talk of Sangam? We'll beat up the bastards! Tehsildar Sahib, who can even talk of Sangam here? - May I recite a verse? - Please, do! You are a flower, yet why do you bring me flowers? You are a flower, yet why do you bring me flowers? Overcome with love, I said: you are the flower. Lovers don't die, but are buried alive. Dig up the grave, you will find... They are waiting for their beloved yet! Mastan, is everything ready? Almost done, Dora. Ranga! Any new bird in the village? - Why don't you speak up? - Yes, there is a new girl. - Then bring her! - As you wish, Dora. Bring her into the room. Ramulu! Ramulu? - Coming... Dora asked me to fetch your wife. Oh brother, I beg of you... I'll be your slave! I'll be reborn as your son after I die! Just don't take her. Come on, get going. - Please... Come on! I said get going! Leave me! Let me go! Did you bring her? - Yes, Dora. Stop crying, Ramulu... Crying won't help. These things happen so often. How will our lives go on if we brood over these things? Go...go and sleep now. Ramulu's wife just stepped into her in-laws and... ...the vulture swopped in! And folks here don't bother! - Why are you concerned? This Nagayya has no sense! He brags to the Sangam. And now, not a word! If it had happened to me... Damn son of a donkey! Chandri! You won't ever leave me, will you? Sometimes, I'm afraid. How close we are now! Hey, Rami Reddy! Come here! How often must I tell you to get off this field? I must come all this way to remind you, huh? You've got a swollen head, it seems! Why the sarcasm, sir? You asked me to come here. Where will I go now if you send me away? I don't know about all that. Don't try to wheedle me! I have court orders, I'll have you know! Will you vacate? Or shall I throw you out? You want us to starve and die because you have papers! You may behead us but we won't budge! You talk big, don't you? Maqbool, beat up Malliga. We harm no one. Let us live. What're you waiting for? Throw him out! You may bring the Devil, but we won't budge. I'll see that you pay for this! Get lost! Whatever you may say, what we did wasn't right. He'll take revenge! So what then, we keep quiet? - How will we withstand his fury? He has strong backing! - But we can't keep quiet! What else can we do but bear it? I don't like what Bapi Reddy did. What happened is done. Let's decide what to do next. Who will keep quiet if your land is taken? Do they give charity when we starve? You folks will not listen to me... Wait! Listen to what I have to say. What's the point of arguing? It's better to tell the Sangam folk. They're educated folk. They'll go to court for us. What do you say? What else? Who will say no to a good thing? You're quiet, Hanuma. You have said nothing. What will I say? Who will listen to me? All must speak! Tell us what you think. What he says is good and right. Let's tell the Sangam folk. Let's do as they say. What about you, Veerayya? Let's do it. We won't loose anything. And you, Ranganna? I think it's a good idea! You're quiet, Rami Reddy Uncle. What's there for me to say? Why should I stop you? Do it. Whatever you do, do it soon. The bastards have grown arrogant! They dare attack him! Mastan, what were you doing when all this happened? I told them we had court orders but they would not listen. You were all idle? You were away. Nor was the young Dora here. So what could we do? So, Mastan! You stand twiddling your thumbs! Don't let me hear of such things ever again! Go! And see to the guys who did it. Stop, stop! All of you, hear me! Look at those three. That guy Bapi Reddy ran away with his father. Or his fate would have been the same. Go on, beat them. Thieving whore-sons! Dirty rogues... Come, Ramayya. Sit down. Things all right with you? - Yes. What're you putting in, by the way? Betel leaves and cloves. Gives gruel a good flavour. Why not ghee instead of all this? How can we afford real ghee nowadays? I heard something happened in the village. Nothing new. They paraded Rami Reddy's sons on donkeys. I expected something like this to happen. No sign of Chandri? She's at the Gadi. Pratap Reddy has come. Wait. She'll be back. Hey, Baginayak, come over... - Coming. When did you come? Want some water? I'll fetch it. Where did you go? - To the Dora's Gadi. Why? - Pratap Reddy sent word. So, you go when he calls? - Can you dare disobey the Dora? What happened there? Speak up! What else? What always happens. But believe me...I didn't let him touch my breasts. So? They'll have milk later... I told him not to touch them. May you rot in hell! Ramayya...try to understand! You seem new around here. Will you fill up? The water's over. What caste are you? - Telugu. Where are you from, son? Siripuram. I told you. I forgot. Why did you come to this far off Suryapet? What else but for livelihood? I couldn't live there. Rama, someone's at the door. Go see who it is. You fool. Is the Seth in? Yes, sir. Sir, Amir Sahib has come. How come you graced my poor home so early in the day? No special reason. I felt like seeing you. So here I am. Rama, get some snacks for Amir Sahib. I told you! Find all details before buying that land. Why are you bothered? I'll talk to Amir Sahib. Give him something and everything will be fine. I don't know. He seems very greedy. Seems to be expecting a lot. We're getting such good land so cheap. And you grumble! Don't worry. We'll contact the police when taking claim. One word from him and it's all done. Rama is a good boy. He is good at house work. Don't send him on errands. Let him be at home. All right. How can I say no to you? Give me another pan. No, brother no! - Go on, smoke. Please brother, no. I must go. My Seth is going to town. Madam, you called me? Ramayya, let down the mosquito net. Did you eat? - No. I'll eat now, Madam. I left you some sweets. Eat it. All right. By the way, are you married? - No, Madam. Any kept woman back home? - No, Madam. Well, wait... Come, sit here. Here, some closer... Madam, what's this? Don't tell anyone. It's all right, come here. What a chance! And you lost it! You let go a willing bird! You're a useless guy! Drink. No. - Have a drink, you fool. Give me some money. Why did you leave her? - My god, she's the Seth's wife! So what? She is a woman, too. She'd have given you money if only you'd obeyed her. You ruined it all. Just look at me! Three burglaries! I went to jail ten times! I was working for a Seth, too. He had a daughter. She was 14, a real juicy girl. One day, with her... You thieving whore-son! Up to your dirty tricks, are you? Brought a beggar home and what does he do? Steal! Where have you hidden it? Tell me! I didn't steal. I don't know! Then who stole it? Did it walk away? Look at that ugly thieving mug! I know who you are going round with! Answer me straight. Or I'll have the police beat you up! Madam, I found the plate... ...in the puja room. Were you blind all this time? My god, you think this dirty son of a bitch is any better? Sir... What's the matter? I won't stay here anymore. I'll go. Why? Is your belly getting too full? I beg you, Sir. I won't stay here. Give me my wage. It's a topsy-turvy world, my friend. I told you then but you didn't listen. You did nothing, gained nothing. Only got a bad name. I don't want to live in Suryapet anymore. Where will you go? Back home? My village! What's left there for me? Go there and you'll be Dora's bounded labourer. Wonder how my father is. Chandri...I thought she was mine. The Dora called her... and she went to him. Why should I live there? I have nothing there... Absolutely nothing... Where will you go then? Anywhere... What's it to you? Come with me... I'll show you what fun is. Where's Lachi? - How should I know? Where's Lachi? - Ask over there! He has come for Lachi, I hear... From where? - Seems like a smart guy! Lachi? Lachi! You have to wait a little. Take care of him... What are you staring for? Come, sit close to me. Can I touch you? Your friend has paid me. So do what you want! Come... Ugh! Drunken bastard! Hey, stop! Not that way! This way. No, not that way...this way. What is this? You're making me go around the world. Haven't I paid you? Go on, go! Where have we come to? To the same place you got in! There's the liquor shop! Good, I'll get off. Some fare you are... Take it. Let's go to the cinema. We'll go straight to the theatre. Stop...I'll get down and walk. No, sir. I'll take you. No matter. You stop. Let's go. How long have you had this cough? About a month. Haven't you seen a doctor? What's your name? - Ramayya Where do you stay? You know the chabutra over there? Next to that... By the way, Ramayya... Have you joined the Union? What Union? - The Rikshaw Union Why do I need Unions and stuff? - Why? We're just day labourers. Why do we need it? It's very wrong to think this way. Why are there Unions? to help and look after you! It'll help if you're in trouble tomorrow. A Union will safeguard your rights. Get in, sir. Breathe in. Take a deep breath. What's wrong with my friend? Hakim Sahib says your pain will increase if you operate a rickshaw. No rickshaw pulling, he says. - How will I live, then? Stop for a few days, bhai. You'll get better. Radayya, Maqbool Sahib will speak. You must come. Ramayya... Come to the gate-meeting this afternoon. Don't miss it. What good am I there? Don't say that. Come and hear what he has to say. They're depriving us of all our rights. Sucking us dry! When we ask for a raise, they say yes but never raise wages. The wage they provide doesn't even meet our basic needs. We must be united if our lot is to be improved! Nothing is impossible to achieve if we are united! Long Live Revolution! Long Live the Workers' Union! Workers of the world, unite! I feel we must talk to the owners before the strike. Carry on with that, I told you. Peaceful means may not work... - Let us come to a decision. Don't you recognize me, sir? You look familiar. You got into my rickshaw, and then walked when I started to cough. It was I, sir. Are you OK now? - Yes. When did you join here? - A month ago. Have you joined the Union? No, but I'll join right away. You must. The Union is for you all. Yes, kill me and my kids! Then you'll be happy! When my kids and I die, you can get happily drunk! No one can stop you then, go on! Kill us! You're getting too big for your own good! Naturally! With you feeding me so well! You keep talking and I'll kick you! One more word and I'll kill you! I earn the money, and it's mine to spend. Who are you tell me how to spend it? You talk like your father's the one feeding you. You didn't say it was your father's money. You've no shame while raising kids! You whore! I'll break your bones if you say anything! Yes, kill and eat me! You hungry bastard. I'll teach you! You feel nice when you fight this way? Did I say anything to her? You make my name mud! Look at him! If he drinks away his wages... What will my kids and I live on? Who cares about me? All anyone cares about are themselves. My body, my heart is on fire when I work near the boiler. Do you care? Sure, you do. She only knows how to nag. The factory owners make a lot of profit. Let's see how they do it. Let's take our factory as an example. To manufacture goods, the factory needs... ...machines, fuel, raw material and labour. Machines, fuel and raw material depreciate. Let's take the above cost to be Rs.3000. Now, another value is added to the cost. That's labour. It's value is Rs.1000. So, the total cost is Rs.4000. As far as raw material, fuel and machines are concerned... ...the owner pays the correct price. Do they pay labour its right value? No! They give workers only 500 rupees. What's the total? Depreciation, fuel plus raw stock is Rs.3000. Add 500 for the labour. It all adds up to 3500, right? Where has the other 500 gone? That's called surplus value. The surplus value goes right into the owner's pocket. If a worker works half a day for his own livelihood... ...he works the rest of the day for the owner's profit. Yes, this is exploitation from within. How do we stop it? Good question. The state of the villages is atrocious. You've seen the cities, too. It must change radically. How can that happen? - Why not? For instance, take the People of Russia. They fought and liberated themselves from landlords... ...and capitalists. Similarly, other people are fighting this exploitation. I'll go, sir. Come in. Have some tea before you go. Want some water? - No, sir. Sit down, Ramayya. Surayya, let's have some tea. What's this? - I must send it to my father. Oh, to your village. - Yes, sir. Your father's name? - Irayya. Name of the village? - Siripuram, Nalgonda Zilla. What shall I write to your father? Well, that I'm okay here. Why don't you learn to read? - Me? Yes, I mean you Ramayya. Look, the world of tomorrow is yours. Of workers. What you're learning now is through experience. If you're educated... You'll learn about society and the world. Your skill will improve, and shine. Concede our just demands! - What can I do? We'll stop working if our demands aren't met! Come what may, we must win our rights. Give me a beedi. Ramayya... Let's go and talk. How are you in here? What happened to you? Oh, that. It's a long story. Forget my affair. Why are you here? We had a strike at our factory and I was arrested. I want some water. Mallayya, get some water. How's my father? - He's fine. We didn't know where you were until you sent money. Your father misses you. Is Chandri there? She married and went away. I couldn't think properly then. I came apart because I was angry at Chandri. Now I know how wrong I was. What's the point of repenting now? I heard there was a big struggle in our village. Tell me about it. Our village is really not the same anymore. The entire village is as one. It's joined the Sangam and stands united. Those who had terrorized us can't sleep now! For fear of the Sangam. Really? Are you telling me the truth? Would I ever lie to you? All are one, whether dobi, barber, potter, or cobbler. No bonded labour or tax! Do what you will, we said. We were all one. The Doras were raging with fury. They got us beaten by goondas. Did we take it lying down? We gave it back to them! One day... We must all stand united and face any hardship. But we'll not tolerate their tyranny. We must all be together. Sathi Reddy is like a father to us all. The Police Patel came at that moment. A meeting, is it? Sathi Reddy, come here! What's the matter? Come, I must talk to you. How often must I tell you to stop this Sangam nonsense? Came all this way to tell me this? Dora asked me to tell you to come back to work. Tell your Dora we won't dance to his tune now. Come! All of you! As he ran, Mastan turned and fired. Our Rangadu died. Almost a hundred were badly injured. They called the police and got four of us arrested. And then, they took us away. Beat us up like hell. They branded me with an iron rod. While branding me, they said: "We're laying the road to Moscow on your head." You're going the right way, they said. What's this Moscow? Moscow is a city in Russia. The poor there fought and won. I'm just an ignorant shepherd. I don't have an inch of land. But when I see him, I just fell this. Every man must have some land. We're all attached to this land till we die. What's that ruckus? Shut up! Nagayya, I'm thinking of going to our village. Yes, you must. Go and met the Sangam folk. When will you come? I don't know But tell them all: I will be back. What're they saying, Sir? - Lies. All lies. They say the Sangam members are all goondas. That they loot and burn villages. They are spouting lies by the mouthful. Sir, I want to know: do you think people believe this? Yes. There are a few who believe it. Anyway, you decided as I had hoped you would. I'm very happy you are returning home this way. You'll have to go home via Alipuram. You remember Yella Reddy, don't you? Yes, didn't he come to our meeting in Murshidabad? That's right. You remember well. Give him this letter. His house is by the fort. Remember all that I told you and keep it in view. Understand the conditions of the village well. We'll surely win. The final victory is ours. Red Salute! Halt! Come up this way. I've come from Hyderabad. I have a letter for Yella Reddy from Maqbool Sahib. But when I went there... Yes, I know son. I'm Yella Reddy's mother. But...how did it all happen? Last night, Razakars and the police attacked the village. We didn't know what to do and ran helter skelter. Whoever they caught, they killed. They molested the women. Others they tossed into the garbage. They may come again at any time. Can you spare some water? Did you see Yella Reddy? Were his eyes open? We had beaten back two earlier raids. But couldn't withstand yesterday's attack. We don't know what to do now. We must get more guns... Form more groups. Distribute Zamindars' lands amongst the people. Our people in the cities suffer the same. That's what Maqbool Sahib wrote to Yella Reddy, too. We'll not stop the fight now. In Telangana, by the end of 1946... the Nizam government carried out mass arrests. And let loose police terrorism. Under the pretext of "Law & Order,"... ...Razakars raided villages. Their means of terror were burning, looting, killing... ...raping women, and extortion. Telangana oppressors redefined terror and blood baths in history. The raids continued day and night. People were victims of torture. Some who were captured were tortured into betraying the Sangam. People were imprisoned, spies were let loose. Dark clouds of fear and terror enveloped Telangana. Father... How are you? I'm here, Father. All our troubles are over now. Where's the gun? Hand it over. Telangana is awake. Resistance started everywhere. Andhra Mahasabha and the Communist Party... ...formed groups to resist the terror. The people of Telangana took up arms to liberate... ...themselves from an evil feudal rule. Guerilla groups were formed in villages. People began to collect arms and make country guns. The armed resistance of the people... ...shook the foundations of feudalism. Will you eat? - No. Why don't you eat a little? I'm not hungry now. You're here and back in the jungle within an hour. You don't tell me where you are or what you do. You know everything, Father. The villages are up in arms. All the Doras have fled to the city. Our Dora has gone to the city. He may be gone, but his son Pratap Reddy is here. The whole village is united. Let's see how long he stays. I don't know. I'm afraid for you sometimes. You are my only son. It's not as if I had four and could afford to lose one. What better life is there than working for the people? You know what our life has been like here! Time is on our side now. All of Telangana is aflame! Don't ask me to give up my work. What you're doing is good. I didn't say it wasn't. But you roam all over. I'm afraid of what may happen. Why fear? What's meant to happen, will happen. Dora, the Sangam folk are making bombs and guns. We can't fight them during the day. What do you mean? - What I say is true. They are very strong. - So, then we are weak like women? You cowardly bastard! Sir, we don't have to be afraid. Who is afraid? I beg your pardon, sir. It's better to heed Durgayya. Yes, Dora. You have fed us and we're afraid for you. All the Doras have gone away. It'd be better if you too went to the city, Dora. We will come with you, too. Who are you to tell me? What's life without guts? I'll send for more police and Razakars. Let's see who dares come here! I had my say. It is as you wish. There is no wishing. I'll not leave the Gadi, never. Well, Mastan? If the Master permits... You head over there. I'll approach from here. You know what to do. Throw the bomb from that corner. We must get down after they go to that side. All the others will rush in when the bomb goes off. Mallayya, bring the papers. Throw them into the fire. Wait! These papers held us in bondage all these years. The Doras could play their ruthless game. They sucked us dry. Their game is up. Our hardships are over. Go, set fire to that heap. Victory to the Sangam! We still have the problem of land in spite of all this. All this land was ours once. Then the Doras exploited it. Now, we have our land back. Uncle Sathi Reddy will preside over the land distribution. Why me? there are other elders in the village. It's not a matter of big or small, but for the benefit of all. Yes, what we want is distribution. In the Telangana struggle... ...30 lakhs of people in 3000 villages were liberated. They established a people's rule. People's committees brought about massive land reforms. Nearly 10 lakh acres were redistributed. Bonded labour was abolished, along with exploitation. Look, my Ramayya is giving land to everyone! Whenever I ask, all he says is wait. And wait! Others matter to him more than I do! What is this, Irayya? You're being childish. We are giving to everyone, one by one. You're so impatient! You want to harvest before sowing! That's not it... - Don't drone on in my ear. You called me. I suppose everyone's got land now? Well, what of these people? Let's see. How about land beyond the village for them? Listen, all of you. You will all get land, as Ramayya has said. Don't worry. All of you will get land sooner or later. And Ramayya, we must also distribute... ...the cattle and ploughs we found in the Gadi. Yes, Uncle. I hadn't forgotten that. Ramayya, why don't you give me some land now, at least? I'm tired of asking. Wait, Father. You are driving me crazy. See how he brushes me off! Listen, Irayya. You take the two acres next to the Dhobi ghat. I'll tell Hanuma. You go and tend your land. May you live to be one hundred! God bless you! Your words are sweet music. I'll go see my land. I wonder how my folks are. There's been no word from them. I keep thinking about them. My brother hasn't come by even once. Don't you worry. They'll all be well. I met a farmer from there the other day. All the Doras have gone to the city. That so? - Yes. You know, over there they're fighting hard and well. We're teaching our members rifle shooting there. Why don't you learn? Why don't I learn, if only some would teach me! One...Two...Three... August 15th, 1947 India gains Independence. Power was transferred from the British Viceroy... ...to the Indian National Congress led by Pandit Nehru. The entire country celebrated Independence Day. People danced with joy. But conditions in the State of Hyderabad were different. The Nizam refused to join the Indian Union. He declared that Hyderabad would be free. Demanding that Hyderabad accede to the Indian Union... The Indian National Congress, the Communist Party... ...and other National Parties held demonstrations. The disturbed situation and public pressure... ...forced the Nizam Government to free political prisoners. The white man's rule is over. It's our own rule now. We're free. They've released prisoners from jail. We were freed, too. Sattayya here has been released. Yes, I too am coming from prison. Why not come to our village? - Shall I? Sing for us. Cart yoked to cart, we will build a caravan of 16 carts. And which cart will get you, Oh Nizam of ruthless rule? You've worsted the Nazis, Oh Nizam of ruthless rule. The police and the army, you think they are mighty. You turned them loose, to loot our villages. Oh Nizam of ruthless rule All the landlords and all the feudal lords, too They cower and seek your shelter, oh brave protector. Men and women both, and all the children, too... We collected cart loads of stones and pelted your army. And into their eyes, we threw chilli water Your mighty army turned tail and ran, oh ruthless Nizam Sprawling Suryapeta is ours as is Nalgonda in the Center You're in far off Hyderabad and Golconda towers above Under the ramparts of Golconda fort... We build you a grave! O Nizam of ruthless rule The Nizam's official called the landlords and... ...title holders who had left the villages... ...to an emergency meeting. Speaking to them, he said: "We are all in an extremely difficult situation." "On the one hand, there is the Indian Union..." "...and anti-social forces on the other. You know it all." "You must all go back and protect peace and order." "Foreign powers have promised us weapons." "Similarly, the Government will also provide full support." Generation after generation... ...under the kindness of our gracious Nizam Sarkar... ...we have been the owners of our lands. Our beloved and noble state is threatened by danger now. We'll not resist any sacrifice asked of us. Yes. This is what I expected of all of you. Return to your lands and help us quell this rebellion. Hark, oh victorious son of India, victory is ours! In the North is a hamlet. Rampuram is its name, oh son In that hamlet are only hovels and huts It's the home of workers who labour day and night The sweat of share-croppers water the crops, oh son Whatever the crop, unjust levies are their lot. Thanedar and Tehsildar, all must be given their cut. Get up! Run! The police and Razakars are coming! From where? Which side? We must stop the police and Razakars! You, go over there! September 13th, 1948 The Union Government took Police Action against Hyderabad Within five days, on September 19th, 1948... The Nizam surrendered to the Indian Government. The Indian Army entered Hyderabad and Secunderabad It was commanded by General J.N. Chowdhry The people hailed the army. The State of Hyderabad was declared... ...part of the Union of India. You were saying something. Tell us more. The Congress held a meeting in Pirlapelli. All went well. I'll tell you what happened there. The Nizam is gone. No more trouble from Razakars or cops. Our land is now part of the Indian Union. We, too, must join the Union. We must return the lands to the Zamindars. The people and Zamindars must live like brothers. We must stop the struggle and maintain peace. This is what was said in Pirlapalli. We must think about it. What's there to think about? Think! Might as well garland the Doras! Carry them in a parade! Wait, Nagayya. Why get so impatient? Elders say impatience gets you nowhere. Ugh, Elders! We'll not give up land nor let the Dora return. Listen well to what I say. Even if God comes down, I'll not give up my land! We're not waiting with folded hands to welcome them. This concerns us all. We must all stand united. What do you think? It's like we climbed up a ladder only to be pushed off. It's back to misery again. A three-day wonder, as I expected! We fought hard to reclaim our land. And now, you talk this way? Some integrity! Stop being impatient. Let others speak. Yes, how can all of us get so carried away? We must weigh the pros and cons. You speak, Sathi Reddy. We're all pulling in different directions. We can't be hasty. No point in being wise after the fact. The Nizam is gone anyway. How many have we lost in this struggle? Our life is so hard and brutish. I think it's better to stop the struggle. Why get into this at all, then? You should have kept mum. Is this some practice fight? Stop, he says! We shall never give up our land. Think! How can we retain it? You know, Uncle. That villain won't let us live if he comes back here. We'll die twice! Then let's die now. That's true enough. Our life will go back to misery if we let the Dora return. He's right. That's true. No giving up our land! - Or letting the Dora back in! What's destined will happen! - Wait! What will be, will be. Your thoughts, Elder? So be it. We can't stop fate. Though the guns boom... And bombs rain down... Don't lower the flag we hold aloft Hail, our flag of victory! Dedicated to all who died in the Telangana struggle.
