BANDITS RAID DOWNTOWN BANK Central Trust Victim of Bold Daylight Holdup the dark-haired beauty helps the cops of bank robbers. havin another hold up All our high-powered district attorneys been able to do is arrest one lone helpless little girl she's not so helpless, she doing alright. how long can he hold her? - indefinitely. unless she's smart enough to get a lawyer those are rights. All Sinton trying to do is grab himself some cheap publicity. all that gang we put him in fatten up on the big stuff. money Rex hasn't been an important conviction since he took office. Not bad-looking either. - she looks kind of familiar to me. Oh maybe she want a beauty contest sometime. Miss American bank bandit. - She doesn't look the type. Maybe she's not even guilty. but why don't you feel the might of you're a broadcasting company behind her. Anymore and plan to throw it against Sinton. Yeah, but he's already in. I might be able to stop his reelection this fall you mean you'd really start a political campaign just to help one little gal? I'm not to help anyone necessarily. but to get that chair out of office. You know what I think I'll do? I'm gonna start a series of broadcast. Tanner a dozen. I'm going to expose Sinton that entire set up behind him. okay chief, when do we start? - tonight. I'll switch program to take the 8 o'clock R myself. you better get the newspaper and see that we get a break. Okay again I'm on my way. from the first day Lois Sinton took office criminals have been flocking here in droves. we have had four bank robberies within the last two months. and our esteemed district attorney has made just one arrest. A girl whose picture you probably saw on today's paper. They call her the dark haired bandit to build up the story for publicity purposes but all they have against her actually that she had a dog she didn't know. I think mister Sinton should be our dog catcher instead of our district attorney. I've heard enough of that grill. you're not going to let him get away with this. I can't stop him from broadcasting. - Well, then play it the other way. offered to cooperate ask his advice. tell the newspapers that we're going to work with him. and if he thinks we're holding a Burton girl without reason invite him to investigate. - That's a good idea. he's through. in the fuzz right now. Hello. Get me Kenneth Phillips at the Commodore Broadcasting Company and make it snappy. Hello? Who? oh just a minute, please. now that's getting action quick. Sinton want to talk you. Hello Sinton, mr. Phillips. So I'm willing and anxious to cooperate in every way. And as for that Burton girl, I'd like to have you talk to her yourself. All right, when can i see her? - Anytime you say. I'll call you in the morning. - Right. Well, that's that. - maybe I'm being played for a chump John but Sinton talk to me like a kid brother. He wants my advice my help everything. Particularly your support in the coming election, so go easy. Yes. Well what do you want this time? I told you everything I know. Why don't you let me go home? I'm afraid you're in for more questioning mrs. Burton. There's a gentleman in there wants to talk to you. Would you follow me, please? Well, what do you want? Ken. - Doti. - Well I'm glad to see you. Wait a minute are you the one who wants to ask me some questions? Ah, don't worry.. I'm not going to put you through any third degree. I came down here to talk to a mrs. Burton. I had no idea was that is Doti. I've had an awful time of it Ken. All I've done is answer questions one after another. A million times they've asked me... Where did I get the dog?, Where the men that pull the holdup?, where's the money... - Let me take a good look at you. No wonder your picture looks familiar. Burton, right? - No. I just took that name when I left home. Added the mrs for protection. Seems silly now but I thought I needed a stage name. I even thought I could act. - We all used to think so. I remember during my last year in school how good you were in that comedy part. What happened to me here was tragedy. Bad as all that? - Well, not all the time, of course. I had one summer in stock in New Jersey and last season I had a swell spot in the show in New York, but after a couple of weeks it folded. and it was one agents office after another until finally it came to an occasional week in a nightclub the same old story Ken. Small-town girl goes to city comes the dawn and all she's got left is her Grouch money. Or what? - Oh, Grouch money. That's what show people call their savings for a really rainy day. To me it was money to go home on. So, you want to go back? - do I want to go back? listen Ken, I used to think I hated that place. But now that's all I do want. There's money for my ticket I was putting in the bank when he arrested me. I was tough. It's only because these people here needed a scapegoat that they picked on me. I maybe I can help you. You mean that, Ken? - Let's see. Sinton will you release mrs. Burton in my custody? What? - I'll be responsible for her appearance anytime you say. Phillips I think she's a member of that gang. - I don't. All right. In any event she can't leave town. She won't. She'll be at my home with my sister. When can she go? Anytime you say. Get her discharge papers, Mac. What do you want to do first? Well, I guess I'd better get my things. You want me to sign a surety for her appearance I suppose. I'll have the papers and everything ready for the time she gets back. And I'll meet you here in about an hour. Is that alright? sure I'll do anything you say from now on. Swell Burton. I can't understand how you failed on the stage. it's because I wasn't acting with mr. Phillips. I meant every word. Okay mrs. Burton. Have it your own way, but I still don't believe you. There you are. - Thanks. Don't thank me thank Phillips. That's exactly what I'm going to do. 921 FURNISHED ROOMS Who is it? - It's Dot Burton, Ma. what are you doing here, kid. Come in. - Thanks Ma. didn't jump since did you? - No. Believe it or not, Ma I finally met a man who had faith in me. He's not the only one. - Who else? - Me. I always think you had no business running around with a lot of lugs like the mob upstairs. well I had to live and they staked me. But to put in an owl, aren't you? - I'll say I am, for keeps. Then I feel better. When I introduced you to Carey in his friends I never dream there is bad they are. Dot, there's a police car passing now it's going very slow. well I'm sure they didn't follow me here. maybe they're watching for Carey and the boys. I don't think they even suspect them. By the way, did Carey got a package here for me? No, he didn't. I haven't seen them lately but understand that fixing to leave town I can better have a little talk with him. Now, you said you were through with them. Well I will be. Tomorrow when you pack some things for me I'll be away for a few days. Hmm? cars parked at Smitty's. - okay soon as we get the Louise let's put the dough three ways. what about that sky? I said we were going to split three ways. don't worry about the girl. She's liable to be on ice for a long time. yeah but I still think she ought to get a cut. how'd you get here? - took a squad car from the DA's to a fake address, then taxis here. Two of them so I wouldn't be followed is everything all right? - yeah, just perfect. So you discreetly get out, did you? listen, I got out clean and came here for my share. That's all. Where is it? You'll get it just take your time. I just want to give you a tip. There is a police car outside watching the front. Ma is right.Yyou did lead him here, didn't you? I didn't mean to carry. honest I didn't. well we can't take any chances now. If it catches with this money we're all in for a long vacation. Yeah, she's right. We better blow. I'll stashed it. don't let them take you that. you deserve even more than they promised you. - Thanks, Wilson. You were always okay, and if you ever need a favor just ask. Come on let's go water with a roof and come back to that stuff we're not so hot. I'll go out the way I came. They got nothing on me. okay dad I'll get in touch in a few days. Say Ma, would you do something for me? Anything if it doesn't cost me money. Keep this briefcase and don't give it to anyone unless they give you the other half of this dollar bill. You understand? Hey, that's mine leave a drama has been the airing bride's earrings of this cold and in the second I have two... That's wonderful. Take good care of it Ma, because it doesn't belong to me. I'll do anything you say, dearie. Lo long. - So long. Sorry he's awaiting Ken, there was something very important I had to attend that's all right. Sinton till I have a sign party. Sit dawn. Sounds like I was a telegram or a registered letter. but seriously Ken, there's something I want to tell you. about some money... - don't worry about money and you don't have to tell me anything. bygones are bygones. I know Ken, that's very nice of you to say that. but still it's something I must explain. No there's plenty of time for that after you get out of here. all I want to hear you say now is that from this moment on you're going to forget everything you've been through and start all over again. Promise? Promise. and that gives me courage... the courage to tell you what you must know before we go any further. what do you mean? I mean that up to now.. I haven't been on the level with you. When I realized what influence you had and that you could get me out of here I... well I played up to you. I even lied to you. Lied about what? Well, I was mixed up in that bank robbery. You mean... - that's why I'm trying to tell you. but I want to square it. I'm going to do it. Now, wait a minute. You can't square anything like that. well here we are. All ready to sign. Oh what's the matter? What's happened? when I'm sorry Sinton, but you've been right all along. right about what? I just told him something you didn't know. About bygones. - Bygones. - Yes. Bygones that he promised to forget. as long as he didn't mean it. And I'll tell you the truth. I was in on that bank robbery. Well that's fine congratulations for its good work. Now let's have the rest of it. Who are the men what are their names and where's the money. I'm afraid you'll have to find out those details for yourself. I confess to save him the trouble. And may I add my compliments mr. Phillips. so the quicker you realize, this is neither a country-club nor a concentration camp, the better. it's up to the women themselves how they're treated. if you behave yourself we'll meet you more than halfway. But if you want to be tough we can be tough with you. Now is that clear? Yes. - Yes what? - yes ma'm. Tell her the rules. See that she understands them. And she won't have that for an alibi for breaking them. Come on break. DOT BURTON SENTENCED! I feel rotten. after all I did tell her bygones are bygones. What of it, chief Just another crook. Not exactly. don't forget I've known her ever since she was a little kid. I don't think she ever had a decent chance. well she's in the state prison now. so what are you gonna do? I'm still going to try to help her. And she'll like me. everything okay Burto? - just perfect. thank you. got a private room absolutely every convenience. except of course already on a writing desk. there's a radio in the big room and a writing desk too. but you won't be allowed to send that is the first month. so now I have plenty of time to think what I have to say before I write. Come on into the big room. It'll do you good to meet some of the others talk to them bit. Hey, girls. Look! New fish. Works. And why should Louis Sinton take credit for Dot Burton's conviction? implying his usual bullying tactics he could never have secured her confession in a thousand years. and she responded readily to kindness and reason. and in so doing proved that despite this one mistake she nevertheless possesses a basically sound sense of honour and a high sense of duty towards society. - Turn that off. Dot Burton confessed of her own accord. Turn that off, I said. Who wants to listen to a mealy mom... What right you got telling me what to do? this is my night to play the radio and I'll play what I want. Lucy's right. The girls take turns on the radio and this is her night. - And tomorrow is my night and you can hear music that hot and sweet. say, I never saw you before. Just who do you think you are? My name is Dot Burtn. That mean anything to you? I'll say it does. You're the bandit Beauty that Phillips one after. Take a look, girls. See Arlo's brides a white boys rob banks. Maybe should give us a lowdown on how to keep out of jail. Ha, ha, ha, ha. - Shut up Lucy. you know it's against the rules to remind you inmates what they're here for. Oh sure miss Jenkins ,I'm sorry. I never meant to break the rules. I never do. You know that. Alright, Fenton. And don't you start anymore bronze you'll find yourself a solitary. you got nerve Burton, haven't you? So? - I like women who ain't all sawdust inside. thanks. home was never like this. Most of the girls aren't so bad. I've been here over two years and I controlled it about everybody's number. Who was that little pixie I had to run in with? Lucy Fenton president of the bird club. membership limited as to pigeons only. I want that battle scarred zombie with him. That's Deaf Annie, a life. got nothing to gain by playing the stood 'coz she can't hear it any worthwhile anyhow. So why was he hooked up with her is anybody's guess. they make a great team alright. Yes. A things out of here and go over to my cell I've got a couple of cigarettes tucked under the mattress. - swell. so outside of working for parole the other reason for behaving good is to get sent to the farm. That's open in summer for trustees and a condom girls. well parole is too far for me to think about now. So all I can shoot for is the farm, I guess. of course it ain't exactly Central Park. At least it's away from here and the stoner the head matron. Yeah, she's hard as Flint. We struck sparks the first time we met. how about Jenkins? - tough on the routine. she's okay. say if you ever want to get a letter out or get anything sent in from the outside I've got a friend who's a trustee. Well, I guess that's about enough for the night's lesson. yeah that's enough for tonight. it could be tomorrow and the day after that, the day after that, years of them. Hey, Carey when are we gonna get some action. We're just about out of dope. Yeah, thanks a little play man, we're just about out 40 geez. Maybe it was somebody else you don't even know if it was. No. But I'll find out money soon. What do you mean? I think I go to see her. How? - As a visitor. - A visitor. click on the snake edge. - first-come first-served. you're going to get served alright and I'll cook the dish. you wouldn't put poison in it, would you? orange, who told you about that? A little bird. And not a stool pigeon either. We're that Myrtle. I'll twist her tongue out. I... I'll... - miss Jenkins. Come here, please. miss Jenkins she told me. she called me a poison. time to hurt me humiliate me before everybody. Easy now, don't get excited. what's this all about, Burton. - Nothing miss Jenkins. I just beat her to the ironing board, she got a little math. That's a lie. - Burton, you know the rules about that kind of talk. miss Jenkins I didn't mean to call her a liar, I only meant I never did what they accused me up. I never poison nobody. I was frame. All right, all right, everybody in this place was frameing. Are you leave Burton alone until she finishes and then you can have the board. And you know better than to make cracks like that too. I didn't do it deliberately. I didn't even know why she was in here. Just a shot in the dark. - but I did foam so don't shoot wild again. by the way Burton you have permission to receive a visitor tomorrow. A visitor? Who's coming to see me? Listen, if that's Phillips, you tell him to stay away. That dirty double-crosser... - Is not Phillips. Then, who is it? - your sister. my sister? - that's what the myth says. It says that I... - what's the matter with you, Burton? Nothing I just felt that after Time heals all wounds, deary. it'll be nice to see her and know that she's forgiven you anyway. What's the matter, kid? Your sister isn't a vampire, isn't she? I don't. know. I haven't got a sister. Now you get some. Times up Johnson. - goodbye Bill, I'll see you next visiting day. all right, Burton. Suprise to see me? Just wondering why you're here. that's all. to find out about the briefcase, of course. sure I might have guessed that. but you won't find out. Did they got it? - they didn't get anything... with me. - Where is it? so we've got to write down our cut heaven. - you weren't giving me my cut. you're relieving Tom with that money when I came back. Oh, listen Dot, you know I... You're all a bunch of cheap vulters you're all set to cut me out only I beat you to it. gonna keep it all yourself, eh? That's right. the whole forty thousand. that's what you think. listen sister. we'll be waiting. well don't hold your breath because it'll be a long time. And it's ten to one you'll all be in yourselves before I get out. Now beat it. Before I pull off that trick wig and turn you in. See your brother. - I saw my brother. I saw something else too. the Burton girls are sister, but her sister was a man. oh man. - He came to find the money. forty thousand dollars. Only Burton knows where it is. you sure? - I'm sure. I read their lips just as I read yours. you're going to tell the patron? Nothing I can tell anybody that can help me. - Then it's a secret. your see. maybe I'll help you. - I'll say it will. Did she tell the man where it was? no. Then I can tell Mrs. Stoner whenever it is the most good. See you later. Kuji well So that's who my sister was. Carey Wells, the guy who was glad to see me take the rap so he could get my share of the money. was it a lot? - Yeah, but it's where it won't do anybody any good now. I'm sorry. - So am I. I know I don't mean only about that. I was hoping your visitor might have been someone sent byKenneth Phillips - Phillips? Say, I hate him worse than I do Carey. Maybe so. But he can help you. he already helped me once. To get in here. Yeah but you don't know how he feels about that now, you haven't even read his letters. I've got a hunch a sorrou. - it's too late for that now. don't think so. He's a big shot he's got a tray. he wanted he could help you even in here. shandricka full of it Oh, and think about it now. write him see him find out what's on his mind. I play ball with anybody but Hitler to get out of this hole. quite a big smile. Good news? - You say it, John. Dot Burton wants to see me. I thought you sent back all your letters. she did she must her had a change of mind. Now you just can't wait to see her and give her your love and regret. More than that John. I want to give her a little hope. hope that I can better the chance he wanted before. the chance to go straight. it's now you're paying your debt to society, you earned the right to a new life. yes I know that Ken. and I've learned my lesson at last. so if we can just let bygones be bygones like we talked about before Well that's swell Dot. I'm going to tell you something else. Any more advice, please. I'm afraid I couldn't stand it. well very well then I'll give my advice to someone that will appreciate it. I'm going to ask the board consider your parole. Oh Ken that's wonderful. I never dreamed that you'd ever have faith enough in me again to do anything like that. But I have got all the faith in the world. That's big in you finally generous of you. And I love you for it, Ken. So, your kids made up, huh. - Well when I told him I loved him, he beamed like a Brooklyn school kid with a ticket to the World Series. Sure. Men are all the same. They believe what they want to believe. So, then he said he checked with the district attorney, and have a talk with mrs. Stoner here. he was almost sure the Board of parole me at their next meeting. When you're practically up with Phillips going to bed, for you how can you admit. nerd I feel kind of cheap promoting Ken like this. you know you always liked me when I was a kid. Now listen hon, you're not going to weak. not exactly but I'm beginning to see his angle. Jjust like you said, I made a mistake and I've got to pay for it. Well, if you feel that way about it, you love the guy. but don't let love make you forget the 40 g's. Breather worried about that money again. if anyone here even suspects, I'll really be cooked. Strait it. - Stupid. I have news her friends coming up to parole. What freend? - Dot Burton's. She'll be up next month. Phillips was helping her. - Phillips. She's song today. - And I'll see the matron. And tell her? - all about the money. That will help me with the matron in Vicksburg who you'll never get understand. Not so fast. Vicksburg will asure she never get out. Never. Never get out. - That's what I said. She... (?) - When will you tell? Now? -Yeah. No I wait. I wait over the day of meeting. I'll let Burton build her whole sky high. Then watch him down. BANDIT BEAUTY ASK PAROLE Board To Consider Burton Case Tomorrow It won't be long now, Burton. I hope you make it. Thanks miss Jenkins. I hope so too. Excuse me mrs. Donor, but... can I speak to you a minute, please? I'm busy now Deaf and I have a parole board meeting at 10:00. Yes, I know.Ttthat's what I want to talk about. But you're not eligible for that several months yet. No ma'm, but Dot Burton is today. What have you to do with that? Wel, um... nothing directly, but... you know I'm always interested to help whenever I can. Even if the girls do think I telling I shouldn't. I know you understand that I only doing this for general good. - Come to the point. If you've anything worthwhile tell me, you know I... never forget. It's about the money that was stolen from the bank and Dot Burton's mobster - What about? Well, bank will backed up this. They pay reward, won't think? Certainly, so what? Mrs Donor if you approved at Burton's parole and she gets out, you'll be freeing the only person in the world knows where that money is hidden. How do you know? Once a gang came to see her, and ddressed like the woman she wouldn't even tell me where it was. I can't quite believe that. Oh but ma'am it's true, one note that. Was a way to find out. nd if it is... see who is it. - Yes, ma'm. Mr. Phillips is here ma'am. - Oh tell him I'll meet him in the boardroom in just a minute. But he said he wanted to see you before the meeting. It would be as well to see him first. Show him in there. - Yes, ma'm. Mr. Phillips, please. Good morning, mrs. Donor. I just thought I'd check with you before the proceeding start. I have mr. Sinton's better here approving the application for parole and thought you might submit it with your own letter. Well, that would be the procedure if I were going to approve. If you were going to approval? But you agreed. That was before either in certain new facts concerning the case mr. Phillips. You mean about miss Burton? - I do. Well I don't know what you could have learned that was the first criminal actually ever committed. Now she served more than enough time to be eligible. There's still a question of the stolen money. She didn't take that. She never left the bank until she was arrested. that's the same. I have reasons to believe that she and she alone knows where it is. That's absurd. If she knew where the money was, she'd have told the authorities long ago to help her own case. Ah not necessarily. What are a few months in jail compared to all that money. I still don't think she knows. Well, there's one very simple way to find out. just make her a proposition. - What kind of a proposition? if she'll tell us where the money is we'll approve her parole. I wouldn't do a thing like that for a million dollars. It is she's entitled what unconditional for all she isn't . Just the sam I intend to find out where that money is. So I shall not approve your application at the present time. Well, that's not fair. - That's my decision. May I see miss Burton? - No. Very well then I'll see the district attorney. I'll see the governor. - You can see whoo you want mr. Phillips, exept miss Burton. You did jet right miss Doner. - I'm sure I did that. I know she wants me? - No, you may go. oh tell miss Jenkins the burglars not to appear before the board today. Yes, ma'am. I will. Oh miss Jenkins. Tell Burton to wait. Mrs Jenkins, mrs. Donner said you to tell Burton she's not to appear before the parole board today. Well, seems to me like you told her yourself. Why? Was the meeting been postponed? No. They just remove your name from the list. I can understand that. Mr. Phillips said... Mr. Philips said plenty. Oh what am I supposed to tell her. I'll find out what happened. To me probably just some red tape that's got tangled. what did happen Fenton? I can see you're just itching the gossip. Well ,to tell the truth... - If that's possible. Oh, but I am telling the truth. Mr. Philips tell to mrs Donna that you know where the money that was told her from the bank is hidden. Ken Phillips said that? - yeah, and he also said, that before he'd approve your parole you'd have to tell him where it is. So, that's his game? Aall he wanted was the money. Wait a minute. If Phillips wanted to make such a deal, why didn't they send for Burton? 'Coz mrs. Donor wouldn't go for it. she said parole shouldn't be bought or so and that either Burton deserved one unconditionally or not at all. That doesn't sound like mrs Doner. And she also said that she didn't think Burton know where the money was hidden anyhow. But should have offered to make a deal long ago herself. Why didn't mr. Doner call me and to face that he'll? No. Because 'coz mrs. Doner refuse. Mr. Phillips didn't want you to know that he suspected you. Maybe I'll have you followed, if you ever do get out. That's the dirtiest trick I ever heard of. of play down kid. You don't want everybody to hear this. No. And don't tell anyone I told you niether, I getting wrong. You will always be in wrong with me. And I know that you get out of telling this. come on Dot. Let's talk this over quietly. Something smells pretty sour about the whole setup to me. When it happened. I've got a hunch that scenting was at the bottom of it. Well, I don't trust her either, but one thing makes me believe her this time. Ken Phillip said I had to pay for everything I did. if he thought I knew where the money was he wanted payback. But how did he know? Yu told me. I never told a soul. Well, you talked about in the visiting room too, didn't? Oh, but we were whispering. Just the same I'm giving ten to one that's how I got up. That's it. I told Carey and he told Ken. This is Carey screwing enough to pass up 40 g's to get even with you? No of course he wouldn't. Well that's all. But I'd pass up a mint to get square with mr. Phillips. Tough to do I'd say, you're being in here. Maybe. But if I could play them one against the other. I saw him with mrs Doner, Burton. And the only thing I could learn was that she shelved your application. Well, I think I know why she did it, miss Jenkins. Maybe she's right. that's the way to take it during it. it'll all work out for the best major, I'm sure. Miss Jenkins, will you tell mrs. Doner to get mr. Phillips here? I'll tell him where the money is... if they approve my parole. Oh, so it's money you would give them. well if that's the way it is, I'll tell her. but it's no way for anyone to get a parole. Have you gone crazy? - Not me. I'm gonna outsmart them. That is if you can do what you said you could. What's this? - Get a letter out. That's easy. - Then settles it that. and Ken Phillips gets that money you'll think it was bombed by a Flying Fortress. Dear Wilson: I'm asking the favor you once promised. I had to tell Kenneth Phillips where I hid the stuff, but if you catch him out after he see Ma, he will have it. All I want you to do is... All I want you to do is to see that he gets what he deserves for double-crossing me. D. B. - can you tie that? Paul must have had the dol all the time. With a shake it down furred right now. No, we ain't gonna do that. We're gonna do it just like dad said. good mind she tell me where it was I thought. Maybe she was figuring on buying out with it. Sure it and his trick reform across it. We will take care of mr. Phillips. Burton! I'm told you admit knowing about the stolen money, miss Burton. Is that right? Yes. I know where it is. Where is it? Wait a minute. We got something to settle first. remember I been fool before. That's all then explained. I'm talking about the clever little deal you've made. but I never had... - Don't bother to alibi. I know all about it. You know all about it? who told you? Iif it was Lucy, I'll... - Even if it was Lucy I wouldn't snitch on her. But that's all past history now. How about my application? Have you approved it? the district attorney mr. Phillips and my letters are in here. but you can hardly expect me to submit them yet. Is your letter in there? Yes, it is, but I must admit I hated to write it under these circumstances. I'll bet you did. All I can say is that you'd have had the money a long time ago without writing anything. you'd had half as much faith in me you said you did. well that's pretty hard to believe in view of what you're doing now. I'm buying my freedom, that's all. I got that money as soon as I got out of jail, and I told you in mr. Sinton's office I had something to give you. But you couldn't wait. You were in such a hurry to turn me in. Yes, I think I do remember you're saying something on that sort. Mrs. Doner, you've got to promise me one more thing. I haven't got to promise you anything. Well but this is for your benefit. I don't want anybody choosing in on the credit that belongs to you. So I want mr. Phillips to go for the money alone. And bring you the reward. Well, Burton, tha's very considerate of you, I'm sure. What do you say? All right with me. But you must promise to go by yourself. Here's the name and address of a person who has the money. And here's part of a dollar bill. You'll need it to prove that I sent you. okay it'll have to wait until after my broadcast and I thought. that's all right. you can phone me in the morning that you have it and then I'll have her lease. Yes, be sure and phone as soon as you can. Naturally I'll be anxious to know how you came out. All right Goodbye mrs. Doner. goodbye. Anything else mrs. Doner? No. Yes... exept, well... I appreciate it the way you... handled everything. Thank you. I thought I did a pretty good job myself. in this way I'm you still get my cut and get out of here too. Not to mention getting square with your friend Phillips. I can imagine that. If I know Wilson he'll crashing on him like an army tank. well you played it smart all the way around. If mrs. Doners on the left. - of course she is. she thinks I'm her fairy godmother now. Look around. She's coming in. Oh good evening, Burton. I just stop by to thank you again and to ask you if you remember just how much reward was offered? Well, about $5.000 I believe.. My, that's more than I expected. to think that I almost let mr. Phillips talk me out of making the deal He tried to talk you out of it. But I thought it was his idea in the first place. The idea was soul in mind. That's why I'm entitled to the reward as you said. It wasn't he the one who told you I knew where the money was. It's only nothing it was thought. I found that out myself. How? - That will not discuss. But I'm quite certain that he's not entitled to the reward in any way. I'm not worrying about the reward. I'm wearing how I've been tricked. What do you mean? I never tricked you. Or whoever get it all adds up to the same. I made a terrible mistake How. - But Ken he's innocent. He didn't cross me.. And now he's walking into a trap. I don't know the same. - You don't have to. Only phone call for that money wasn't come. He is in danger. Oh, wow. Why have you imagined all these things all of a sudden? I'm not imagining iit. It's true. How do I know that this isn't just some scheme,, to keep us from getting the money at all? Mrs. Doner, you've got to believe. - I don't. We should get the phone. - I shall do nothing of the sort. I guess I'm some that's all. Where you going, snoop? - None of your business. Won't you come in and visit me for a while? No. - You mean yes. Oh, whoa. You are not to do this. - It's the only thing I can do. There's no other way. You'll ruin everything you'll never get parole now. I'll never want a parole if anything happens to Ken. Ah! Help! Start the alarm! ... for new pacients. well it looks like Dot just giving us another runaround . Dot don't give anybody a runaround. Hey, Carey. What if I tell you? well let's get going Who is it? - A friend of miss Burton. You wouldn't know my name. How? You ain't an actor you wouldn't admit that. What do you want? -To give you this 1/2 of a dollar bill. Oh I remember now. She said if that man sure I could have a package for me. Wait a minute. I'll see if it matches. the two go together like a sister act. how is she getting along? - Fine, fine. She'll feel even better when I tell her I have this. You a good tolerating brother. Come on, Ken. I get the money. After me, Ken. This way! Police headquoters? This is 92000 Ouk Street. Oh, please, hurry. Give me that gun! Ken. ... back! Don't shot. Come on, Ken. Ii get youu to thee car. Come on, but the your protection. - Wait a minute. Let me go. Why it's tanker car. come on, take mine. won't headquarters and tell him car 23 it's been stolen. Get it! Operater. Give me police headquarters. And the carving car was number 23. But car 23 stolen. Broadcast full description. Step up, we gotta shake them. Don't open several on the next turn. that is member the waterfront. Will become a short drive with hit it straight away. But try to have the plenty. like traffic on the coast road or a space to Luthor. Hello, a harbour station? the gang is called car 23 or on Central. Headed for Bayshore. If you work fast you can block him at the intersection. That's all. You haven't got a chance. ....we'll run you down if it takes a million dollars. if you wait that much? - I'm not. Getting you is if you're a killer you shot him in welcome to. Wwhat are you doing? Three in my hand, so we're gonna handle the rod. Okay but don't try to free yourself with all that Jack omn you. You'll get a little closer. Maybe I could plug one of their tires. Don't try it. Rectifier girls in there. Were black! ... ? Dot. Dorothy honey. - Call ambulance, Ed. Every morn I sing this song. So, nothing with me can be wrong. I plexus lunch and dine each day on nutty bread, so I'm - Open. Very good. Ken, we're you listening? Iit's not like you had your heart in it. Tired? - Tired of lying in bed, but not tired of rehearsing. I think you think I really have a chance for a job. oh you have more than a chance. You have a sponsor. Well we can that's not possible. when nobody's even heard me. - I have. I've assured the parole board that you have a job the moment they approve your application. Oh Ken, that's swell. Where is the job? Oh, my studio. What do you think where? well I'd be on as a regular commercial announcer? Well they're going to be with me regularly, anyway. And I hope one of the announcements won't be commercial at all but more on the nature of a society item. That... ? - well you'll have to write that yourself, but again yes. Corrected by suadnovic
