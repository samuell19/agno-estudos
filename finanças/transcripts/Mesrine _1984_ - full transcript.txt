The only power I wield is my sincerity. A determined man can rule Paris if he puts his mind to it. Once you push a man to the limits of hatred. To the limits of despair and his own violence. He has every right. A guy locked up in a high-security unit has every right. Jacques Mesrine. Born 28 December 1936 in Clichy. For Eva. I've seen some guys in my time. But none quite like you. I can't stand pimps. SENTENCED FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. SENTENCED FOR ESCAPE FROM A CORRECTIONAL UNIT (CANADA). Did you fire those shots? Yes, Sir. Open up your boot. Don't you know it's against the law to carry guns? I'm taking you to the station. The escapees. SENTENCED FOR MURDERING TWO PARK RANGERS (CANADA). Surprise was our trump card. We've had it now. Let's get out of here. SENTENCED FOR ARMED RAID ON THE CORRECTIONAL UNIT. The Mesrine case. Jacques Mesrine. You are in court for... Everyone on the ground or I'll kill the judge. Let's go, your Honour. You're going on a trip. SENTENCED FOR TAKING JUDGE HOSTAGE IN COMPIEGNE COURT AND FOR ESCAPE. ARRESTED ON 28 SEPTEMBER 1976 AND SENTENCED ON 19 MAY 1977 TO 20 YEARS IMPRISONMENT. Mesrine, visitors' room. I want to go back in. It's going to rain. - Did you get my last letter? - Yes. What's all this paranoia about microphones? I'm sure there are mikes in the air vents. That's ridiculous. What for? To record our conversation. - Don't move. - You're crazy. You'll never get away with it. Everyone on the ground or I'll shoot. You, open that door. Get undressed and no funny business. On the ground, he said. Go on, get in there. Quick. Everyone in there. Open it. Get down! The ladder! The bag! Is no one coming for the ride? Walk on by calmly. Don't move! Don't move. Prison break. We're commandeering your car. S May 197s RTL. 11. 12am. Paris. Jacques Mesrine's escape. The gangster has escaped from Santé prison with two other inmates. One of them was killed by a warder. The country's borders are closed. Airports, stations and highways are being watched, especially routes out of Paris, since it's unhikely Jacques Mesrine has heft the capital, where he will be seeking refuge. Your documents, sir. - My mission orders. - Thank you. Carry on, Colonel. At 9am Jacques Mesrine, Frangois Besse and Carmen Rives were walking in the prison yard. At 9.30am, Mesrine was called to the visitors' room to meet his lawyer. He heft the room several minutes later, armed with three pistols and a machine gun he stole from a warder. He threatened the guards, seized their keys and opened his associates' cells. A|| three reached the prison's outer wall, seized a ladder and, with the help of a rope, climbed over. Police guards opened fire. The runaways retaliated. Rives, who was still on top of the wall, got hit by a bullet through his heart. A|| I can say is, this is a very serious matter. At first sight, it would seem that this escape was made possible by a degree of complicity. I'm determined to draw all the necessary conclusions resulting from the investigation. What we need to know now is: Who is this man who is now free? What we do know about him is quite worrying. He wrote an autobiography entitled "Killer Instinct" a year ago. And he has a fairly hefty criminal record. Finally, for Mesrine's fellow escapee, Frangois Besse, it's his fourth prison break in seven years. We need better weapons than the cops have. Then we need to rob the best armoury. A cabinet meeting has been called and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing has again asked for sanctions to be imposed. Do you have any handcuffs? Put them on. This one's good for cops. I'm excited about taking over this town. You bet. A spa town, too. With a great casino. It's crazy only having three or four cops on night duty. Once we've overpowered them, we can do the casino in peace. I'm Superintendent Sillard from Paris. - Good evening, Sergeant. - Superintendent. I'm here to see how your colleague, Mathieu, is doing. Mathieu was transferred to the Var region over a year ago. A cushy number in the sun, eh? Yes. He wanted to be closer to his children, too. Anything to report in the region? No, sir. It's very quiet. But the tricky season is approaching. Good luck. I'll be back to see you tomorrow. You do that, sir. See you tomorrow. Four cops on duty in Deauville, eh? You must pass that tip on. It's a tip from four years ago. The number of cops has shot up. There were more than 20 of them. - What do we do now? - Hold up the casino. We'd like to see the manager. Sit down, gentlemen. It's not your books we're interested in. It's your safe. Or rather, what's in it. What do you mean by that? I'm Jacques Mesrine and I want you to open your safe. Paul, give me what's in the safe. Very good, sir. It hasn't been a good day. Would you mind showing us the way out? 26 May 1978 - I've been hit. - Me, too. Let's charge the backup car. Shit! A white Renault 14 drove through the roadblock. Roger. Give us the details. Shit! They'll never get past us. We plan to comb the area. 200 men, 38 roadblocks. And helicopters? Helicopters and dogs within the hour. I think we should be on the scene. Luckily the bullet went straight through. Switchboard, do you read me? Switchboard, here. I read you. Go ahead. Superintendents Broussard and Devos have reached P5. Roger. Switchboard calling Uranus. Uranus here. Nothing to report. - Saturn? - False alarm. Came to nothing. - Calling Mercury. - Nothing to report for the moment. Jupiter here. No one's passed by for two hours. Hurry up, kids. We're late. I'm Jacques Mesrine. Don't be alarmed. We need your help. This won't get violent. What do you need? A car and someone to drive it. My husband will be here in a few minutes. In the area around Bernay in Eure, hundreds of policemen have spent a sunny Sunday searching the woods. The pohice are absohutely convinced one of the men who held up the casino in Deauville is Jacques Mesrine, public enemy number one. Jacques Mesrine and an accomplice escaped Santé prison. The level of complicity they have enjoyed has hed to the dismissal of the head of the prison service. Mesrine is a man with a past. So, boys, first day of the shooting season, was it? What was yesterday still just a commonphace crime in Deauville, has become almost an affair of state. The battle has only just begun. - Can I buy you a drink? - I wouldn't say no. My name's Bruno. I'll have the same again. Cheers. Do you know what you want? I don't know what to have. A tenderloin steak, rare. Wouldn't you rather try the wild duck? It's in season at the moment. Wild? If you like. Two chicken liver pétés to start, with pickled onions. Then duck with pepper sauce for two. Have you got a nice Burgundy? Of course, sir. A 1974 Nuits-Saint-Georges. Very good, sir. For a plasterer, you have a real taste for good food and fine wine. I'm not a plasterer. I'm a lawyer. Here. Look. You make a strange lawyer in your overalls. So as to better defend my clients, I always put myself in their shoes. I got that plasterer out of a tight spot because I was with him on the job. And do you never part with your bag? That's another story for another day. Eat your pété before it gets cold. I'm getting to like you, you know. I'd like... I don't know how to say this. - I'd like us to live together. - Drink your coffee before it gets cold. What happened to you? Those scars and that bandage? I couldn't tell you earlier, but I was wounded by the police. What are you talking about? I was in a spot of bother. It's nothing. Let's just say, I'm rather an unconventional lawyer. Hello. You might recognise me. I'm Jacques Mesrine and I need money again. Keep calm. Don't go upsetting your child. Like I said, I need money. I remembered your testimony at my trial. The raid on the Société Générale in Boulevard Gouvion-Saint-Cyr in 1973. - I've been transferred to Drancy. - It's the bank I'm interested in. Like I said, I need money. Go and get dressed. We're going to open up the bank. Meanwhile, my friend will take care of your wife and child. If all goes well, you'll have nothing to worry about. How did you find me? It's been five years. I don't know anything about managing a bank. But when I want to find a guy, I have no problem. I love you. It must be a brilliant feat. Nevermind manifestos and letters to the press. There are maximum-security wings and men are dying in them. What we need to do is take Mende by force as a symbol of repression by the prison service. It's a real graveyard situated in Lozere, France's most desolate region, 200km by mountain roads from NTmes. It's the only prison in the world to have eight warders per inmate and where the number of prisoners has never exceeded 10. The first rule to learn in Mende is total silence. A|| those who have been inside and survived have lost the power of speech for varying lengths of time and suffered varying degrees of damage to their nervous system. That's if they weren't admitted to the psychiatric wing. We will form a veritable commando. We will free all the inmates. Such chaos will ensue, the media will have to write about conditions in Mende. I guarantee they'll close it. We have weapons and we've just taken out a bank loan to finance the operation. We just need men. If I have to train with the Palestinians, I'll do it. If Peyrefitte doesn't react, I'll launch the most violent attack he's ever seen. It will be worse than the Baader Meinhof gang. I'm an explosives expert. He'd better not push me to the limit. Surely this isn't where you live. My name's not Bruno. It's Jacques Mesrine. Who? What's your name? Mesrine. Jacques Mesrine. Ring any bells? No, never heard of him. This week's Paris Match. Jacques Mesrine, after your escape from prison, do you now live like a hunted man, permanenthy on the alert? A man held at bay is a scared man, but I'm not scared. I've got two and a half months of my life back. The place I was in was killing me. What's left of a man after 20 years in prison? You have to experience isolation to understand. You lose your sense of taste. You lose your hearing, you forget how to speak. If you fancy a boiled egg, you have to wait 20 years to get one. I'm prey now, Surrounded by thousands of hunters. It's the open season all year round. Wherever I am, I always have two grenades and a gun on me. If I hear someone shout "Police" at the door, I have my pistol ready, at arm's reach. It's my life insurance. If the police came to arrest you again, would you turn yourself in? I will never turn myself in. My days of sipping champagne with the cops are long gone. It's war now. There's no hatred. It's survival. They're after my skin so I defend myself. The cops do what they have to do. They won't let me off lightly. In the end, there's a degree of mutual respect. I don't like guys like Broussard, but I respect them. He's a worthy adversary. Wasn't your escape a betrayal of the jury that was throwing you the lifeline of 20 years imprisonment instead of life? If 20 years in a coffin is a lifeline, I don't want it. I was sentenced to 20 years in a normal prison, not a maximum-security wing. I have happy memories ofjuries. Shouting "Die!" in the street is one thing. Sentencing someone to death in court is another matter. It's a jury's job to show understanding and humanity. Jacques Mesrine, do you think you're a dangerous man? Faced with armed cops, I have no bounds. But dangerous? Maybe. I don't know. As for being a public enemy, that's a myth. I don't attack the public. How do you think you will grow old and die? I'll never grow old. I know very well this will end badly. I know I'm going to die. In a week, a fortnight, eight months, or a year if I'm lucky. I couldn't care less. I know they'll get me in the end. If you like, I'll take you away on holiday tomorrow. I'll give you a holiday like you've never had before. Palermo - July 1978 You settle in, darling. I'll be back in less than two hours. Get some lunch sent up for yourself. We'll need eight men for Mende, including an explosives expert. How's it looking on the ground? First we need to take the police station which adjoins the prison. We need two pilots to fly everyone out. It'll be safer than by road. There's a flying club nearby. Taking the station will stop the cops raising the alarm. We'll overpower the three or four warders at the bar. And we'll do that dressed in police uniforms. Do you think your friends here in Palermo will join us? Getting a gang together is easy. I'll talk to Benex in London about pilots. It'll be like old times. For four months, Mesrine and Besse have been making fools of the police. Our weekly meetings are summed up in the minutes by: "Nothing to report". And yet the press talks only of Mesrine. We're starting to look ridiculous and at the Home Office, the situation is unbearable. With Mesrine, we're not dealing with an ordinary gangster. He's set apart from the mob and has never been part of it. He disassociates himself with the world of organised crime. He's a loner. He's a marginal criminal who won't respond to standard police methods. There are no informers prepared to finger him. After his escape from Santé prison, He's in hiding and moving around France and abroad, particularly Algeria, where a villa has been semi-officially put at his disposal. Like a true anarchist, Mesrine has taken advantage of leftist and international terrorist networks. What's more, he has managed to make, by campaigning in prisoners' action groups against high-security units, influential friends from the extreme-left. He's got hold of weapons, money and assistance and he derides the society he claims to be fighting an ideological war with. On a scale of negative values, he scores pretty high. London - September 1978 What got into you? I won't have any man touching the woman I love. I need to go home, Jacques. Leave me your passport. You can travel with your ID card. If you breathe a word, I'll kill you. Jacques! Someone you can trust will be waiting at the airport and won't leave your side. If I ever have to kill you, would you prefer a bullet in the head or the heart? Jacques! Benex! - Still the same. - Jacques. That's it. I hope you haven't lost your touch. I don't have the reflexes I had in Algeria, but never fear, I still have a steady hand. You'll need to see about finding the other pilot. You should have seen Christine on her first day at school. She looked so cute. I bought her a blue dress to match her satchel and I put a ribbon in her hair. _ SAVE? _ Yes? I love you. I love you, too. I love you and I miss you. Damn. I've run out of coins. No wonder. We've been on the phone for over an hour. Sylvia, when I get back to Paris, we really must live... Together. - There's nothing else keeping us here. - Everything's settled. The money, the gang and the two pilots. We could pull off Operation Mende in a few days' time. I'm getting restless. I've got withdrawal symptoms. I need action and risk, for God's sake. Where's your gorgeous Italian? She's gone back to Paris to be with her daughter. Sylvia's important to me, you know, Frangois. I know, Jacques. I trust that girl. But don't forget the golden rule: No women when you're on the run. Come on. Thank you, Mr Vautier. A certain Jean-Luc Coupé, a leftist delinquent, completely off the wall, was bragging that he knew Mesrine. I had him followed for three weeks to no avail, until the day an Italian girl called Sylvia moved into his block. - You're not disappointed? - No, it's perfect. With a certain Paul Vautier who reminded me somewhat of Mesrine. Well? Very funny, boys. I've only ever seen the bastard vertical. I want you to watch him 24/7. I don't want him being tailed. If it is Mesrine, we don't want him suspecting anything, or he'll beat it. Only alert the waiting car if he moves out. - Any news from Palermo? - Yes. There's a delay in sending the men. They're at war over control of the drugs scene in Marseille. But in principle, nothing's changed. We'll get our men as soon as order is restored. - So we just have to wait. - I'm sick of waiting. I need to move. Let's move onto Operation 2: kidnapping the judge. Listen, I agree to kidnapping the judge after the attack on the prison. It will win us public sympathy and give us negotiating powers for our demands. I also agree to kidnapping the judge, should negotiations fail. But it's a mistake to start with the kidnapping. I want you to watch him 24/7. I don't want him being tailed. If it is Mesrine, we don't want him suspecting anything, or he'll beat it. Only alert the waiting car if he moves out. Last stop. A|| change. - Mesrine! - If you don't get out quietly I'll blow your brains out. Bring the keys. Open the boot. Tallest first. Come on, get in the boot. - What are you doing? - I'm going to bed. I'll open. I'm out. We've been in this hole day and night for eight days without being replaced. We're not even paid overtime. Colleagues in the anti-terrorist squad are striking over red lights. It makes tailing impossible. Can you imagine tailing a car and having to stop at red lights? I told the union we're leaving the hideout tomorrow. We're not spending Armistice Day in this room. We'll resume our watch on Monday. 10 November 1978 - 7.30pm Urgent mail for Judge Perrault. Where is Judge Perrault? - My husband isn't here. - Where is he? - He's not home yet. - Perfect. We'll wait for him. Everyone sit on the floor, And I advise you not to move. What do you want from him? I want Judge Perrault to ask the Justice Minister to do away with maximum-security prisons. Otherwise, we'll shoot the judges. Come on, let's split. Call for backup. Drop your gun. Don't shoot. - Quick. We're getting out of here. - What's going on? I've told you before, don't ask questions. Things turned nasty. Coupé got caught by the cops. He might grass on me. - Where are we going, Jacques? - To a friend's house. Just until we get sorted. Here. A|| the morning papers. Just as I thought. Coupé talked. He gave away our address, the studio in London and the weapons stash. It's strange. The papers don't mention you. Are you saying the police deliberately decided not to mention me to the press? It's a trap. Those idiots must think you're a pushover. I feel as if I'm prey now, too. You have nothing to fear. Even if the cops find us, only a sniper could stick a bullet in my head. And they won't want to risk missing me. Algeria made a good soldier of me. A good killer. I even got a medal for killing. I could never forgive the government for letting its youth die for a phony cause while France drank, farted and burped away, with total peace of mind. I was obsessed with the pointlessness of that war, so, on my return to Paris, - I rebelled with my first break-ins. - And enjoyed it. Yes, it becomes a drug. You don't just steal for the cash, but for the risk. But to go from that to killing a human being in cold blood... If men died from my bullets, it's because I had to choose between their life and mine. One day, you pick up a gun, thinking that's the solution. My first murder was with a knife. A pimp who had disfigured a girl. I've always hated pimps. Pass me the cheese. I'm scared, darling. I'm scared for you. I'm scared for us. I'll pull one more major stunt and then I'll stop. We'll settle in Italy. I know a surgeon there who can make me unrecognisable. But first, I've decided to marry you in the town hall in the eighth arrondissement. Marry me? You're mad. We'll have to start again. There are cops everywhere. Our friends can't fathom your partnership with Coupé. He's a tvvit. - I had no choice. You wouldn't join me. - I warned you. I knew it was a mistake. And now we'll have to abandon Operation Mende. It's too risky. Coupé might have come clean. Listen, I'll set up a big job with big money. Trust me. It's best if we split up for a while. I'll find us a big job in Colombia and contact you through Georges Preyer. You finally got a mention in the press. - Really? - Here. Look. "If the police are to be believed, she was living in Germany "before she met Jacques Mesrine after his escape from prison." Living in Germany? What a cheek! - You should write to the editor. - Do you think? - I'll dictate it. - Let's drop it. I will not accept anyone writing such nonsense. Do you hear? "I'll be with him to the bitter end, "to the end of our love affair, "until death, if need be." Without sounding soppy. "Without sounding soppy." Not that bit! No, you're right. Carry on. "If love is a crime, "I'm guilty of love." - That reminds me of a film with Girardot. - Carry on. "Never mind justice and its inhuman laws." And that reminds me of Cayatte. Yes, well... Perhaps we should leave it there. No. End with: "I'll face the music, "as Jacques would say." Brilliant. Read it back to me. "Who are you? Just a woman. But the heart has its reasons..." Here. Choose a photo of the two of us. Make sure we're smiling. It's important. We're heard from Mr Jacques, boss. That bastard's got some nerve. I knew the mutt would react. But not this quickly. Damn it. We've put the paper to bed. The letter is moronic but the girl is gorgeous. He's always had gorgeous girls. Remember Jocelyne? The Canadian. A top model, family girl. Yes, she ended up in Fleury. Let's not get carried away, boys, and stop fantasising about that Canadian. It's the Italian we're interested in today. Bertrand? Get to work. We don't have a second to spare. Pull Chirac in Brittany and insert Mesrine on the run. Just find a way. Wait, that's not all. Put this on the cover: “Mesrine. Photos of the runaway with a gorgeous Italian." Cohas and his wife are on the cover. Won't it be confusing? Just do it. I'm counting on you. Here, Alain. Go and give the letter and photos to layout. - What about the anti-terrorist squad? - We're on the case 24/7. I want the first photo of Mesrine's arrest. Police. We'd like to talk to Mr André Lemaitre. Would you mind waiting here? Mr Lemaitre is having lunch. I'll go and tell him you're here. Sir, two police officers are here. They wish to speak to you. Two police officers? Show them in. What on earth can it be about? Inspector Lambert from the fraud squad in Paris. This is my colleague, Inspector Grénaud. A complaint has been lodged against you at a police station in Paris by one of your tenants at 135 Rue de Vaugirard. The complaint was forwarded to us since it was about excessive rent needing to be paid in cash. I have more than 200 tenants in Paris and believe me, the rents are listed in the ledgers. We believe you, Mr Lemaitre. We think the complaint is slanderous. My superiors would like you to face the plaintiff so the case can be closed. A confrontation? What is this? Yes, we are under orders to drive Mr LemaTtre to the fraud squad in Paris to hear his case in the presence of the plaintiff. Today? Yes, an appointment has been made for 3pm today. But don't worry, it's a mere formality. I see. - I'll come with you. - No, no. You know I'm in good hands. We've issued a description since all the evidence points to a kidnapping. Our experts are working on photo fits of the kidnappers from your statements and we're asking you to collaborate with the police and to inform us as soon as anyone gets in touch. We've tapped your phone. - I've made you some jugged hare. - At the very least... - ...you are hospitable. - You have nothing to fear My name is Jacques Mesrine. It's your cash I'm interested in, grandad. Contact my son. Not André, Mathieu. How much is the ransom? A billion. - It's too much. - Then you die. At my age, I'll have to die sooner or later. That was the best jugged hare I've eaten in a long while. It's been three weeks now. The wait is unbearable. The press say it's Mesrine. Mathieu, one of the kidnappers gave me this letter for you. "You must go tomorrow at 7am exactly "to the Le Canon de Grenelle café in Paris "with 6 million new francs, "that's 600 million old francs, "to receive a phone call there." You should have taken my advice and filled it with paper. Take this so we can keep in touch. - No. I can't take that risk. - I understand. Be precise with your information. To be on the safe side, we'll only use the transmitter installed in your car. Go immediately to Café Magenta, 132 Boulevard Magenta in the 10th arrondissement. "At the intersection of the N2 "and the D18, "behind the road sign "you with find further instructions. " "Carry on until you reach the sign for Soissons "next to which there is a 110km an hour maximum speed sign "with a ringed number 88 painted on top. "You must leave your jacket, take your bags, "and place them at the foot of a dead tree "on top of the embankment beside the road." - Well? - Balls-up. Drat. I'm warning you, I'm sick of this. Your son informed the police. I want my billion. You're going to sign 400 cheques for 10,000 francs. Eight payments of 500,000 francs. You'd have made an excellent businessman, you know. This is no laughing matter. Your whole family will die if this fails. With each payment, the life of one of your sons will be at stake. I always keep my promises. I'm still prepared to pay the 6 million franc ransom. But it's in my interest and the interest of the kidnappers that they don't contact any member of our family. Going via an intermediary will provide them and me with the best guarantees. I would also ask you to provide me with proof that my father is alive. Sign. Is this for your press book? No, for your son's. It's only 7am. Why so early? You're right. He never goes out before 9am. I am reporting that he left home at 7am and is taking the ring road. He's trying to shake us off. Activate the red alert. Backup cars needed, urgently! Damn. It's not him. We've been had. It wasn't LemaTtre's son driving the Mercedes. Me, a billionaire? Are you kidding? 28 July 1979 Far from it, I can tell you. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends, who didn't hesitate to help me find 600 million. I'm extremely grateful to my family for having paid the ransom. Mr Lemaitre, was it Mesrine or not? I am certain that one of my kidnappers... ...was Jacques Mesrine. What's new with you this week, Home Secretary? Apart from the Mesrine case which I know you won't tell me about. That character is becoming intolerable. I thought our police were more effective than this, Home Secretary. The Mesrine case must be resolved, Mr Bouvier. It has become a political affair and needs a political decision. What do you say? Mesrine has had the foresight to study how the police are organised in France and to use that to his advantage. Police throughout France are searching for him, but not the force as a whole. The Mesrine case has simply stirred up rivalries and aggravated matters between the 18 branches in the force, the gendarmerie, the anti-terrorist squad, not to mention the examining magistrates presiding over the various departments. Mesrine strikes in a new area each time. Making the coordination that entails doubly difficult. What do you suggest? Setting up a special Anti-Mesrine Unit under the command of one man. I propose to be that man. But on one condition. Everyone must be under my command, including the gendarmerie. What's up with you today? I'm on a big story. A sex case? A financial scandal? - A scoop. - Political skulduggery? After three months of inquiries, reasoning and tailing, I've finally got him. Who? Mesrine. I'm interviewing him in half an hour. To create some atmosphere. When a guy's about to come clean... ...the lighting has to be right. Shall we get started? Go ahead. You brought me here blindfolded and handcuffed. Are you really Jacques Mesrine? It would appear so. Were you the responsible for abducting Lemaitre? You don't get it, do you? I'm doing the interview. I get to ask the questions. What's your name? Jacques Tillier. - Which publication do you write for? - Minute. So you wrote that article in Minute? - No, that wasn't me. - Who, then? Look at me. You wanted a scoop. You'll get your scoop. Who wrote the article? I want to know. Did you write it anonymously? Yes. I can explain everything. Shut up! You say I don't treat my associates properly? Well, my associates are here. You've got your scoop. We're giving it to you. Why didn't you put your name to the article? - I was on holiday. - You wrote it, I know you did. You've been caught out. So I don't treat my associates well, eh? - I came here in confidence. - In confidence? When you wrote that I don't treat my associates well? We've got some questions for you and you're going to reply. Well? Was it the cops who asked you to write that article? I'm asking you a question! - Is Devos taking backhanders? - I don't know. - Who's greasing his palm? - I've no idea? You've no idea? Do you want me to play you the tape we recorded? - I knew you'd record me. - What did you expect? Devos' address! I don't have it. Let me tell you, I never cross my associates. But dickhead journalists who smear my name get shot in the head. - I am not a dickhead! - We'll see about that. No scoop without photos. This is fun. We could call it, "Libe||er beaten to a pulp." For what you said. For what you wrote. For the hell of it. So long, bitch! Heavens! Can you give me a lift? I've been assaulted. You're in luck. I'm standing in for the prosecutor in Senlis. I'll take you straight to my office. Mesrine did this to me. I'll drive you to the hospital. Mesrine wanted to kill me. He left me for dead in his cave. I have nothing else to add. I'm saving the exclusive for my own paper. It's unbelievable. "He is not dead because I did not want him dead. "I went the distance with my violence. "I used a flash for the coup de gréce. "Nice photo of a beaten-up Iibeller. "He's paid the price for his filth. "From now on, this will be the price to pay for libel." - If Mesrine had wanted to kill him... - Absolutely. Mesrine also wrote to the editor of Minute. "Do not fear for your life. "You are the best justification for my violence. "As for any spies you send after me, "watch out! "I'll be waiting for any bounty hunters with a .357 Magnum." What are these journalists doing, employing police methods? More effectively than the police, too. They've tracked Mesrine down. Match, Libération and now Minute. This has to stop. We can't tail all the journalists. No, and we can't risk another "mole" story, Like the one in Le Canard EnchaTné. But let's get back to Mesrine. In his statement, Tillier wrote that his accomplice called him a fascist. Not uncommon with thugs. And in particular that he said, "I did 14 years in a high-security unit." Gentlemen, that's our first major clue. - Sir, I've got 100. - 100 what? Ex-cons who did 14 years in high-security units. - Do they all match the description? - Damn, I forgot about the description. Sir, of the 100 ex-prisoners locked up in high-security units for 14 years, 94 match the description. Our new hideout. Wonderful. - I love you. - Wait. I love you very much. And that's not all. I love you so much. Sir, after further investigations into the 94 ex-cons held in high-security units... Yes, I know. For 14 years and who match the description. Five of them might be of interest to you. Georges Preyer. He did indeed do 14 years in a high-security unit. And he's free and matches the description. Will you shut up? Well? Georges Preyer. Having the whole force on the Mesrine case prevents us making mistakes. Now we just have to find him. That's like asking us to find Mesrine. Prayer cannot be found. - He went out with a French teacher. - Who influenced him politically. - A pretty blonde, always in jeans. - He was besotted. - What of it? - She disappeared? - I'm listening. - Here, sir. Before she disappeared, Preyer's girlfriend had a beige Renault 14. Here's the registration document. As you can see, there's an address on it. I checked. She's not known at that address. - So that gets us nowhere. - That's what I thought to begin with. But the false address she gave was in Paris so she must live in Paris. Elementary, my dear Watson. And since she lives in Paris, I concluded that the car must have been driven in Paris. I was but a step away from my next move. But you got there, thanks to your vast intelligence. I'm glad to hear you say that, sir. Do you want to see the five parking tickets she got? I didn't have to call on my intelligence to notice that they were all handed out near Saint-Lazare station. I wanted to record this cassette before I die to take stock of my life and my place in society. My choice in life has been to reject institutions. I like this music. 20 years on the run. I was a gangster by vocation, but I've paid the price. At the end of the day, you can't change society. Even by taking up a gun. It's irrelevant who pulls the trigger first. Whoever is shot down is the one who has lost. There is no winning when you live on the fringes. I'm 42 and I've never touched a drop of alcohol. But today I'm drinking to the prospect death. Or life. My death may not be any more senseless than a death at the wheel of a car. If the cops fire first, it's because the order has been given. Preyer and the girl. So they're not responsible for the killing. - Our best bet is to guard the hideout. - Yes. They're bound to come back. Let's warn Broussard. Just seeing maximum-security prisons and how they have been built, not to imprison men... I said 100 francs, sir. Not 10 francs. ...but to completely destroy them... Sorry. ...naturally appalled me. Dying with a gun in your hand is better than snuffing it in a cell. The police need to know that if I have time to reach for my gun, I'll shoot. Obviously, if you're listening to this tape, it's because I'm dead. They live on the sixth floor. They seem to be in love but they don't go out very often. But I have no regrets because I experienced love. And what a good feeling that is. I've always been passionate about women. I remember making love to this music. Listen to this. What's important in life is to carry on dancing. You're here. It's funny, you looked like a clown dancing. You seemed so sad. You are in the house of God, children. We'll get the best view from up here. They're going out, Superintendent. Not before time. It's been three days. - He's going out with his girl. - I need their location and direction. They're crossing at the lights by the Place de Ia Trinité. They're pulling away from the Rue de Clichy. Over to you, 124. Rue de Clichy. I'll take it. Take over if things get heated. 601. Right, lads, don't do anything foolish. At the slightest sign of trouble, take over on the Place Clichy, 143. 143 here. He's on Rue du Mont-Cenis which heads into the Rue Bélliard. I'm gaining on them. Look at them all, lining the streets. We're in the red-light district. Nothing gets in this guy's way. He's parking and getting out of the car. He's a cautious bastard. - Has he seen us? - No, I think they're visiting someone. 133 here. We're peeling off to the left. Take over, 143. They're in Rue Bélliard. They're going into number 37. Get rid of those two whores! That gait, those shoulders. No doubt about it. It's him. It's Mesrine. Your gun's sticking out. Shit. Mesrine's coming out with the girl. They're on Rue du Mont-Cenis, heading for Boulevard Omano. - What do we do, boss? - The road is full of people. I don't want carnage. His bag with be full of grenades. Don't move. Forgive me, I'm on duty. Excuse me, madam. I'm looking for Avenue Kléber. I'm not sure, but go that way. It's that way, is it? Just a minute. Can I just say, you're the only person who's helped me. I've just arrived from Normandy where I live. That's a long way from here. Where are you from? You're not French, are you? - I'm Italian. - I knew we had something in common. - Have you been in Paris long? - Listen, I'm late for an appointment. I understand. Go ahead. I just wanted to say that you're the only person on this square who has taken the time and been kind enough to tell me where Avenue Kléber is. Crafty bugger! I got three close-ups of the girl in her wig, Superintendent. You're late, damn it! I got held up. Held up? You know I wouldn't put up with you... Being unfaithful. I know. - Where were you? - I had to visit my mother. Not the mother story! Mesrine going to see Papillon! You watch Jean Richard in Maigret. Why shouldn't he go and see McQueen in Papillon? - Has the film started? - Yes, ten minutes ago. - You made me miss the start. - Never mind. It only starts getting interesting at Cayenne. - Bouvier here. What's going on? - Nothing, sir. He hasn't moved but he's in there. He came back last night at 1am. - If I go in, he may blow the building up. - No blunders, Broussard. We've been tailing him for 48 hours. My men are cracking up. Christ, my feet hurt. I'm not used to walking in high heels. How much do you think we can get for the photo? It's worth a fair bit. But I'm telling you, we'll get one price for the arrest but we'll get a whole lot more for the body. - I'm going to get one. - Leave that to the snipers. I was talking about a video recorder. Listen, if we manage to catch the big man, what with overtime, danger money and the reward, I'll have enough to buy a VCR. I've been thinking about what you said about the body. You're right, it's worth more. But it depends how long they leave it there. I don't understand. What do you mean? Listen, we'll be the only ones to get the arrest. But if the body's left for three hours, photographers will come flocking. You're right, damn it. The arrest would be better. This is important to me, you know. Broussard didn't believe in me. He's never believed in me. I'm telling you, them getting Mesrine is down to me. I know I don't have his physique, But one day, I'll take over from Broussard. Mesrine has just come out. Let's go. He's under the scaffolding. Shit! It's nothing. I just dropped my sandwich. - He's getting into a grey BMW. - We didn't know he had a car. Roger, start your van. A|| cars, prepare to tail him. - The car's moving. - Go! - He's reversing. - Stop! He's stopped at number 37. The girl's coming out with a suitcase and a dog in her arms. - The car's pulling off. - Go! He's heading for Porte de Clignancourt. Don't let him take the ring road. Regard the green light as the signal to attack. - Why did you call him Scoundrel? - Listen. What else could I call him? Hands up or you're dead! Don't move. The car's bound to be booby-trapped. Bastards! You bastards! You've killed my dog. Go on. Roger, take your van back to the station. You should see your face, little brother. I would have preferred it if we'd taken him alive. - She's alive. Boucicaut hospital, quick. - And the dog? Don't leave it lying here. Take it to the morgue. We got Mm, sh', at Forte de Cfignancourt. He's dead. No police officers were wounded. Great. I'm on my way. The bomb disposal experts. Minister, I thought you should know. Mesrine was killed at the Porte de Clignancourt at 3.12pm. Thank you for letting me know. Jacques Mesrine is dead. Jacques Mesrine, public enemy No. 1, died at the hands of the police in Paris just over an hour ago. It was 3.15pm at the Porte de Clignancourt in Paris. Several vehiches driven by plain-clothed police suddenhy surrounded a car. The men were from the anti-terrorist squad under the command of Superintendent Broussard. The police quickly fired. Jacques Mesrine, who was in the car, was hit. A woman with him was also hit, probably his mistress. At this moment in time, no one knows if she is dead or injured. I've just heard that she is not dead. What did I tell you? Had I known, I'd have waited to hear it on the news at home. I've got an idea but we need to wait for the right moment. We will now hear from a witness who was on the scene when Jacques Mesrine died at the Porte de Clignancourt. We saw the submachine guns and they shot a guy in a car. There was a vegetable lorry and people dressed as market gardeners. Everyone was hugging one another. Everyone was happy. There were at least 15 bullet holes in the windscreen. It was just like in a film. I have just heard that Christian Bonnet, the Home Secretary, has met with President Giscard d'Estaing to discuss the death of Mesrine. The 18th arrondissement's deputy mayor is on the scene. - Do you want to make a statement? - Certainly. Let's go over here. There. Mesrine was born in Clichy and he died at the Porte de Clignancourt. I, therefore, feel doubly involved. First, because justice has been done, and secondly, because it was the courage of the French police that made this arrest possible. Thank you, Deputy Mayor. I don't give a shit about his speech. It's time, Broussard. Have him taken to the morgue at CID. This will be good. Take him away. Shit, it's Broussard I want. Superintendent, a photo, please. No, lean over. Take his feet. Look at me. Look at me, look at me. Look at me. Mesrine's had it. Has there been an accident? Move back, please. You know, my sweet, this will end up costing me my life. Some people with make excuses for me. I make none for myself. There are no heroes in crime.
