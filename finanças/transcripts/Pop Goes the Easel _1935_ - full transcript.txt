People ain't gonna give us a job. We gotta go out and get it. Now, my idear is this: You see that store over there? Each one of us grab a broom. We go up and sweep in front of the place, see? The boss comes out sees three conscientious guys and offers us a job. It's simple. [SNAPS] Get goin'. [PANTING] Stop, thief. Drop those brooms. Thief, police, fire, police. What?

[GRUNTS] The professor wants the first sketch to be The Hunt. Will you get me the hawk? Give her the bird. [TRUMPETS] The bird, the bird. Excuse him, lady. The heel has no soul. Now, here's the idea. You hold the hawk in one hand. And you are listening to the distant call of the hunting horn. I think we'd best release the bird, and in its place, overhead, you discover a group of fine grouse. Now, then. Thusly. I don't see any grouse. See any now? No. See any now? No. Ah! Look at the grouse. Wait a minute. You guys got the wrong idea. Pardon me, miss.
