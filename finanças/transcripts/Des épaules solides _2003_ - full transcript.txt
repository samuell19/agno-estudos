- Mom? - Hmm? - We are good together. - Mhm. You know what is amenorrhea? Why? You know what it is? Sabine, are you off your period? - You know what it is? - I'm asking, do you get your period? Of course I do. Then why are you talking about this? I'm reading an article about it. It looks like female athletes can lose their period for years. - What do you mean, "years"? - No periods for years. It's no joke. - And what can be done about it? - Nothing. It comes back slowly on its own. - You're kidding? - No. - I don't want that to happen to you. - It won't happen to me, don't worry. - Because you're better than the rest? - Yes. - I work with my breath, not my muscles. - That's better. What I love most is long distance. And seeing how the race develops. In sprints, you don't have time. It goes so fast, and you're alone in one lane. It sucks. Me, I don't like working too hard. The article talks about that. It also talks about a girl... who does long distance like me. But she does marathon. Road marathon. It's not the same. Oh la la Sabine, I don't understand any of this. You're interested now? - You're interested in what I do? - Mhm. That's nice! STRONG SHOULDERS hautbasfragile@KG - It's cold! - Jump, it warms you up. - Did you train? - Yeah. What the hell is he doing? We are going to be late. Why aren't you in your tracksuit? We're going to waste more time waiting for you. - What difference does it make? - Gelewski is already late. The championship in a month. I didn't train well this winter because of my knee. There's your buddy. He's not even ready. - No "hello" or anything. - Didn't even cut her hair. I like it this way. He's the new guy. Apparently he does 1.53 at 800 meters. 1 minute 53 seconds?! It's moving fast, eh? - Fuck... 1.53?! - 1.53. Everyone on the track in 5 minutes! Everyone makes an effort, We touch on our tiptoes. And we take a deep breath. Exhale! Exhale on each movement. Fatya, have you gained weight? No no. No? Push here! Tiptoes, there you go! - Ah It hurts... - Now that's a stretch! Roderer, don't force. I have to push the others, while you I have to hold back! On your marks! Emilie, the shoulders! Ready! Go! - Roderer, are you going? - Not yet. - What are you waiting for? - My turn. Be careful, Roderer. You're going next round, I'll be watching you. I prefer to run with the boys. Kevin! Let's go! He's going to get beat up by a girl. Roderer! Your watch. It's not a race, okay? On your marks! Not a race, Roderer, understood? Ready! Go! Hey, new one! You let me pass you. - No. - You did. I know you do 800 in 1.53 - It's because I'm a girl isn't it? - I don't care that you're a girl. - It's my hamstring. - Liar. What hamstring. I have pain in my hamstrings, that's all. It's because I'm a girl. I know. Don't worry, when you're better, I'll take you on. Listen, it wasn't a race, okay? - Are you okay? - I'm OK, just a pain in the hamstrings. - Where do you come from? - From Aix, in the south. - 800 meters? - Yeah, but I prefer the 400m hurdles. - How much at 800? - 1.52. - Ah, well you still have room. - I hope so. And me? You need to lift you ass more, If you want a good start. I set the bar higher, Dani. I'll give you a 1.65... It's important to pass it, it's the minimum for the championship. Go ahead whenever you want. You didn't even believe you could pass it, did you? I don't know where your head is, but it's not here. Bravo, bravo! You suck! You know how to count to five? 5 weeks until the championship! 5 weeks is a long time, we have enough time. - Here, do you want it? - No, that's not what I meant. Okay then, everyone minds their business. All of this is for you. A gift for you. But I do the packing. So if you don't like it... - We... - Now it's him! Is it me running or what? Are you doing me a favor? You do it for yourself, not for me The championship is for you! You are not retired! I don't raise my ass, me? Huh, you idiot, I don't raise the ass? I don't raise my ass... Me? I don't raise my ass? Gelewski? Eh? I don't raise my ass? I don't raise my ass. You'll see if I don't lift your ass! Yeah! I'm sexy! One of these days, I'm going to leave! It's not the moment, where are you gonna go? Monthey. You run and you can't even breathe. Factories everywhere. Smells Where will you go? I don't know, do like Pérec! Perec! I don't know how she handled that pressure. Perec, it was hard for her. It's her thing. No, it was too much pressure. It's even worse that she gave up. - And now she's so unhappy. - She left! Let her bear the consequences. Did you see all the money she made? She was ready to do anything to make money. - You think she does it for the money? - Why else, then? - She doesn't do it for money. - Why then? Me, I don't do this for the money. Yeah, you're young, you do it for fun. Look how hard Sabine works... You can't compare Sabine to a champion! It's not the same! Sabine earns barely 10 francs per race, She made 20 million! Do you see a nice body shape? No, it's all flat, it's ugly! She's not asked to have curves she is asked to run fast... - It's ugly, it's not feminine. - Who cares? Me, I prefer to be slower and look like a girl... Than be fast and look like a man. When you build muscle, you don't think that way... You think that you will run fast. You don't care about looking like a guy. Honestly, look at this, It is a man or a woman? Be honest. Tell the truth, don't lie. - It's like a man, yeah. - It's a man! Marion Jones. If that happens to me, Should I kill myself? Me, if I don't run, I kill myself. If I don't run, I will die. Knock before opening, shit! Emilie, Celine, Delphine, back to your rooms! Floriane, back to your bed, please. And turn off all the lights. Hurry up. - Hi! - Hi. Give me a hand? It smells good! These pancakes smell so good! What do I put? Same as always. - Cinnamon sugar? - Yeah. - Can I take a little candy? - Yeah yeah. Thanks. - That's caramel. It's very good. - I love it. I need to be careful or I'm going to put on weight, I can't stop eating. I'm starving from school. Where are your girlfriends? In front of the store, as always. It's so nice! Hurry, we have to go eat! There's your 1.53. Thanks. What? You're fooling yourselves. He's really precise, this guy. It's like he calculates all his moves. He only makes micro adjustments. Even when he eats. Look... - Roderer! - What? - Are you kidding me? - I just want measures. Measures of what? You don't even run with them! Exactly, I don't think it's fair. Why are you separating girls and boys? I don't understand. Girls should run with boys at the same time. - One simple thing, it's the rules. - I don't agree with these rules. Guicheton! Let him pass while you're at it! Guys, take it easy, since Mr Guicheton is so sensitive! - I want the 800 for the championship. - No! I want to improve, help me! That's all I ask. The championship is in a month, and you don't even care! You train the boys better. - Stop it! I train everyone the same. - No. You always talk about improving, but you run around and you never listen. You are too curvy. You place your arms anywhere. You grind! You run skimpy. And you only think about the clock! I'm the one training you. You won't get the seconds now. Maybe in a couple of years, We'll see about it later. For now, what matters is that you don't break. Damn he is good, this Rudy! Yes, Rudy! Yes, Rudy! Very good, kid! - How much did we do? - Learn to run first, then I'll give you the time! He's so annoying. This fucker won't let me go up to the 800. - Huh? - He doesn't want me to run the 800. What? From now on, I will manage on my own. I will count on myself. I don't need Gelewski. How you gonna do it? I don't know yet. I'll find a way. Don't you think you're exaggerating? Gelewski is very good. - He was at the Games in Munich. - Really? I heard that. Back then with Richter, Matthews... - Ulrike Richter? - Yeah, she did the 100m backstroke. - With Guy Drut and Borsin etc... - See? It's not for nothing. Yeah but look what he's become. He gained weight and lost hair... He stopped everything all of the sudden, just like that. It's crazy. It must've been a personal thing. Because to stop when you are so close to your goal... - Shit, can we sleep here? - Shut up! No, it's fine, leave it, thank you. Fuck! - Bye. - Bye. Sabine! Have you seen my pajama shorts? What? Oh, this goddamn bike! It's been here for two weeks! Where's my pajama shorts? How am I supposed to know where it is-Ouch! - You put it on last week! - Me?! I never find anything. Every time I'm back It's a mess here. What? What did you say? Damn, where are you? Did you tell me: "Don't come back?" Well I won't, bye! It's your bike, You're the one making the mess! Occupied! Can't you wait? - We can share a sink. - I don't like being two. - You got used to it. - To what? Being alone. You think so? Me it's the opposite. I am never alone. I don't like that. It's boarding school, nothing I can do. I don't know... Wake up earlier, sleep later? - That's what I do. - What time do you get up? 6:00, so I have the sink for myself. The horror. What would you say if I became Swiss champion in the 800m? - I would be happy for you. - What about you? I would be happy! What if I was an Olympic champion? The same! - That's all? - Yeah! Olympic champion! Do you know what that represents? You put on some toothpaste. Why am I not like you? What do you mean, "like me"? I don't look like you! We're basically the same size, you put on my clothes! Did you see my breasts? They're much bigger than yours. - You're saying nonsense! - Take your shirt off. No! - Let's compare! - No, stop! - You see, I'm right. - So what difference does it make? Have you ever seen an 800 runner, or even 1500, with big breasts? I've never seen one. Why is it you who has the boobs I want? It's unfair. - Can I use your video camera? - What for? - Micro adjustments. - What? Micro adjustments! Hurry up, Dani. Look, right there! She is so flexible! Look at the stretching material. There's none of this with Gelewski. Look at all these people! Isn't that Diagana over there? - Where? - Across. Diagana! - Look! - Yeah it's him. - I'm going, Fatya. - Where are you going? - Come. - Wait! Here, Diagana is coming. And if he comes? You want to meet him? - Can we a video with you? - Yes of course! - It's no bother? - No at all. Get together, I'll film you. And then you'll do it. - I'll go first. - Yeah, go next to him. - Are you kidding! - Don't be nervous! Can you guys move, so the athletes come through? Yeah thank you, sorry! She's so muscular... Damn... Damn! That's so awesome! I caught her at start-up, right? We thought she was ugly, but she's actually pretty. Really pretty. See her eyes when she drops her head? We see her eyes and she's like a lion. She's like a lion! Look, look! She drains the energy from her arms. And look at this! - Look at her head! - Yeah... Ready! Ready! - What time for the winner? - 10.10 seconds - And Marion Jones? - 10.11. It's not her best time, she's done better before. Not even 1 second between men and women. Are you kidding, It's irrelevant. - 1 second is an hour in a 100 meter. - It wasn't even 1 second! Before, 1 second was a huge difference, but now it's not even 1 second. One day men will peak, And women are bound to overtake them. - Do you know who we saw? - We saw Diagana & took a video with him We saw Marion Jones, we were 5 centimeters away from her! Saint Maurice. Good night! - Hi. - Hi. Did you train this weekend? Not really. He is really bad this photographer. They all have red eyes. Raise your arm! Which side do you want it? - On the left, I'm a lefty. - All good? Hurry up, the girls are coming out. Dani, all good? No, wait, take it off, take it off! - Take what? - Your t-shirt. No! - Are you gonna help me or not? - You're pissing me off. Make a decision! Make up your mind quickly, that's good. You have big breasts, nobody can see anything. Enough! Stop it, or you'll have to go find someone else, okay? What are these holes? - I didn't know where to put it. - Thanks for the airflow. - Watch out with your arms. - Alright, let's go. Let's go! On your marks. Ready! Go! Fatya, don't miss the start... Neither the 1st nor the 2nd turn, nor the acceleration on the last line... - ...nor the end. - In short, I film everything. - Yeah, film everything! Got it? - Alright! You're pissing me off! For the girls, Off to the 400! Be tight on the turn. In the championship, if you're not tight the first 250m, there's no point. Alright, on your marks! Ready! Go! - Did you... - Yeah, yeah, it's done. - Did you get the turns? - Yes! - He didn't see anything? - I don't think so. Wait he's looking. Roderer! Fatya! Girls, am I bothering you? If I am, please tell me. We don't chatter during training, we run! You, you were just wandering earlier... I don't want to hear anything. The championships are in 25 days. If you don't work, you won't go. You won't go because I won't take you! - Her ankle hurts! - Oh yeah? come here. It hurts there. So go to the infirmary. Take 3 days off. 25 days away from the championships... Are you happy? Don't take me for a fool. Come on! Fatya! The infirmary is over there. Please, go ahead! That's it for the day. It's alright Fatya, don't be sulky! Gelewski saw nothing. Be careful, Fatya. You're not even chewing your food, you have to chew... Thanks to your bullshit, the nurse suspended me for 3 days. Exactly what I needed! I'm telling you, Gelewski didn't see anything. Don't be fooled, too. She doesn't give a fuck about us. Be careful! You take less risk by jumping than not. You look like a beginner. If I didn't know you, I wouldn't believe it. Fatya, how is your ankle? Coming back tomorrow? - What did they say in the infirmary? - 3 days. - Huh? - In 3 day! Ready! Go! We resume! - Could you let me have lane 1, please? - Too late, I'm already fixed up. - You could still leave it to me though? - Alright. Be careful with this ball! I suck at football... I may suck at football, but I'm very good at javelin throw! Beware! Excuse me, can you leave me this lane? It's where I run. Your name wasn't written... Ready! Go! - Could you go lane 1, please? - No, I'm good on lane 2, thanks. I'm asking you for a favor, can you go on lane 1, please? Well, if it's a favor, then okay. Ready! Go! Go! Whoa whoa, this is not a barnyard! This is not a barnyard! Roderer, you move! Back to the start! - You have a cold? - It was lying around in my bag. Have you had a cold? Before the holidays. Can I go change? Why lane 1? I don't know. It's like a charm. A superstition. The time I ran best, I was in lane 1, with my bag next to it. I don't like running in the middle, So I continue there. It brings me luck, until the championship. You're kidding me with this charm story of yours. The bag that hangs near the track, what is this nonsense. You're lucky I can't search you. Oh yeah because I'm a girl. Go ahead, search me, I don't care. Go ahead! Call a girl, there's plenty of girls. She can search me in front of a witness, it's fine. - Go take a shower. - Search me. - Pick your stuff and go shower - Search me. Go take a shower! He's crazy. I like how you run. Thanks. - Do you watch me run? - Yes. - So? - You have good base speed. - That's all? - You run badly in lanes. Yeah, I know. I told Gelewski, but he wants me to stay on 400m - You'd like to go up? - Yeah, to 800 or 1500. I don't like the feeling at 400. - You prefer to fight? - Yeah, exactly. - And you? - The opposite. I'd like to come down. Oh yeah... How much do you do on 800? 1.52. - I do 2.13. - Not bad. - 4.36 in 1500. - Oh yeah? - 56.5 at 400. - Well it depends, for a girl. - We could run together. - We've already done that. In competition, I mean. Like for a Paris-Dakar. We have girls and guys mixed. And we all go at the same time. And in the end we make separate rankings. You see, if women and men could run together, Us women could get better, since there's always targets ahead of us. We would run faster. We could do that solely on the 1000 for example. And we would call it the "mixed 1,000", like in tennis. You see? We could do... Uh... We could do it in relay, like in tennis too. We would run as a team. A man and a girl together. And... And that's it. I just think it would be nice to run together... - If we had a "mixed 1000". - You mean the two of us? Yeah. Hurry up, hurry up. Accelerate! Your arms, damn it! You grind... You're ridiculous. You can't run. I will never make it... No way. You really suck. You're worthless, my poor... You won't achieve anything. You are shit. You suck. Just a poor girl. I'm sorry. Push! Push! One, two, one, two. Push! Drag! Push, for God's sake! One, two, one, two, one, two... Come on! Come on! Come on, hop, that's good! Push, push, push. Push! Push! Drag! Push! Push! For God's sake! It's not going well. As soon as you start, it's like you already want to finish - Yes. - And there's no power. I know that I can't. That's why I want to go long. This it's so muscular, I need to do breathing. Work well on 400 and you will go up to 800. - Yeah, sure. - You can do it. You have the ability! You think I would give a shit, otherwise? Imagine for a second, the end of an 800... On the last right line, all the girls take off, they run away. And you, where are you going to get the juice to do that? - Come on, go take your shower. - Already? Yeah, you are doing too much. And I know you train on the weekend... Against what I've always told you... Because the road isn't the track. You could get hurt. - You know that? - I know. - I know what you're thinking. - Well, I don't know. - It will come. - It will be too late. On the contrary. You can't help it. That's very good! Go Fatya, getting better and better! There you go! Dani! Don't obsess over it. We don't know where a blockage comes from. That's why we call it a blockage. It's not necessarily in your head. And then one day, what will happen? Finished, no more blockage. And hop! You will pass it. Do you trust me? Believe it. I didn't want to miss you. - I'll take you. - No, no, leave it. Good morning! You can't, sir, it's a school bus. Public buses is that way. - I'm coming back right away. - I'm moving in a couple of seconds! Don't worry. I found a job, you know? It's her dad You sure? How's training? Remember what I told you: It sucks, and we never see the end of it. But it's only by training that we win these races. Remember that? - I don't worry about you. - You have to get out, sir. - Sabine, can I get a kiss? - Sir, hurry up please! You didn't hear? He asked you to get out. So, get down, please. You have nothing to do here. Come on, get down! Please, I'm asking you to get out. Aren't you bored from doing the same moves every time? Aren't you? You're always doing the same things. - It's not the same for me. - It's worse. What do you do again? - Is that "on your marks"? - Stop! - Stop! - On you marks, with these two fingers? - Stop it! - So, on your marks... Ready! - I lift my backside... - Stop, you're stupid! - Everyone is looking at you! - You need to explain it to me. - You've got to get up! - Ready! And go! Okay here it is, it's in our price range. Oh no, I'm sick of trying on clothes. I spend the whole week changing back and forth, I'm tired. Tracksuits, shorts, showers... I would like to go on just one day without changing. - Bad faith! - I'm not kidding, it's tiring. - Come on, one skirt, just one! - No. - But why? - Cause I'm tired of your skirts. I'm don't even like skirts. Me, I would like, is that you become more interested in what I like. - It does not interest me. - Well it doesn't matter. You just said the opposite. No, it's no big deal. No no! Over there! Small change of schedule. What's going on? Good morning! - You know him? - I think so. - How are you, big guy? - Hi, coach! Yes, it's him! Jacques Piasenta! You know him of course, he trained Marie-Jo Pérec, Christine Arrond... As well as many others, for quite a long time. We all have strengths. At the highest level... Athletes are just like you, they have strengths and weaknesses. And it's important that we have to accept to work on our weak points. Not just to do what we want, when we want it. We are not born Olympic champions. You become one by working hard... on the highest level. You become Olympians. and then, what separates you are gifts. You are young, you're all gifted. But know that hard work pays off. You have to believe in what you do with your coach. You have to be consistent. This afternoon, we are going to do that. We will work on these moves. It's a change of pace... With smaller intervals than your usual training. We will go on high strides. You should not be obsessed with performance when you're young. 13 year old kids often win youth competitions But they don't end up being the best later on. Have you ever let go of an athlete? I train a group. And if an athlete... Expresses harmful behavior to this... This... This group. Well, I prefer to part with them. Which I have done twice, with people of very, very high level. Resume the position like this. Be flexible. Forward! You have to control the knee. Slowly, very good! Now, arms dangling like this, and walk, knees as high as possible There you go, that's very good. Look at her, look! That's good. Push the knees forward. Go, dance, dance! You see, I pull my knee, No foot in front. The foot is hidden by the knee. There is more difficult than this. This is pretty basic. You don't play football. You dance. Like this. Here, like this. Eye-level. Folded, stretched, then again, stretched! Let's go there together. At walking speed. Would you accept me as a companion? Extended feet, don't raise your knees! Thighs down, feet extended. Relax you ankles, there you go! Gelewski doesn't want that I go up to the 800 or 1500. Did you discuss it calmly with him? - Calmly... I don't know. - You have to do that! He's you trainer after all! You should form a tandem. I didn't say a couple, eh? a tandem. So you have to talk to him about it. If we say that most of them, work too lightly This flaw is glaring in Sabine most of all. So she has to work... Even if she has her positives She should work on a finish, she doesn't want to work on her basics. Hey Sabine! Looks like you don't want to work on your fundamentals! Dani... Dani... Can you hear me? Open your eyes. That's good. You're burning out No no no, keep your eyes open. Look at me. Good. We'll let her breathe a little bit. The others, move around a little. Alright, continue with the exercises. Rudy, come help me move her. Stay calm. Don't try to get up, especially. The camcorder is mine. She forced you? Do you have problems with training too, Rudy? - No. - Cause now is the time to talk about it. - No, I'm alright. - Okay. Did she force her? Okay, thanks... Back to work, everyone, except you. So? I'm listening... What do you see there? There... I see my times, my faults. You never give me the time. I don't feel your exercises. You say we feel it when we ran well. Me, I don't feel anything. So I do this. So there you feel it? You just see your time. Listen, you really didn't get it. Piasenta made it very clear... It's the coach, who carries the athlete. It's his vision. You run, I watch you. To each their job. But as long as you don't let yourself be watched, You will won't move forward. Which is what is happening. So listen, uh... For the camcorder, I will say nothing. But from now on... You come here as you want, You go to the championship on your own. Because I can't take you anymore. - Understood? - Yes. Here it is. Here comes my father. - How are you? - Good! We'll go up on the back. He scares me every time he goes backwards, I swear. Stop! I'm holding you because I'm scared! This is awesome, it jumps. This is how we get hamstring injuries too. Come on! - So, how was it, all good? - Very well and you? Yeah, good. - Wait, I'll take it, I insist. - Thank you! There you go, we're home now! - You like it? - Very much. You did well to come. In fact, I invited myself a little. Oh yeah? Well that's good. Didn't you tell me you wanted to change the tables? Yeah, they arrive next week. - Have you seen the new curtains? - Yes. - Good? - Yeah, If you like them. There's room! Miss... - Sabine. - Sabine. - Tap water and a beer? - Yeah. - You doing good? - Mhm. Obviously. - Whoa, Hey! - You're weak eh! Oh! Let's see, go ahead, try me... - Notice anything? - The clock there! I am happy to be here with you. - Me too, it makes me happy. - Yeah? Me too. Here, look. - Ah I hate those, stop! - Yeah? You hate it? - See you later, Miss Carine. - Sabine, dad. Sabine. Yes. Well yes, that's what I said. - No, you said Carine. It's Sabine - Sabine. Is your mom doing well? Yeah. Yeah, she's okay. - She still working? - Yes. - She set up a little place? - Yes... well, she's trying. But... - It's going okay? - Yeah. - Ups and downs. - Well... Like everyone else. And... Is she... - What? - No nothing. Finish your sentence! - Finish a sentence when you start... - Look there! Two cows are fighting. You only see that here. Tell me, Rudy. What do you think about an athlete's body? How do you find it to see all the muscles and everything? Do you find it pretty? And... yeah I wanted to ask, Do you find it pretty... The bracelets, the jewelry, the necklaces and all that, on athletes? Do you find it beautiful? It depends, I don't know, it depends I guess? And uh... and the body of an athlete who has no chest left? Ultra muscular, or ultra thin... How do you find that? Or do you prefer women with big breasts? I... I don't know... I'd have to see... Would you sleep with Marion Jones? Just one night. Just to see... Or would you feel like you're sleeping with a guy? Marion Jones? I... I think I could... Well I think so... - So you like women. - Yeah. I mean, even athletes. Well, yeah yeah. - Why do you ask me this? - No reason, it went through my head. Come on, harder! - Can you hold tight? - Yeah. - You sure? You can hold it? - Yes! Ah! Move! Move! You see there, there are hard zones. And here... It's hard almost everywhere, but here it should be less so. For fibers, it's the same. Biceps. Triceps. Take off your shirt. - What? - Take it off. - Spinal erectors. - I'm ticklish, careful. - Go ahead. - Spinal erectors. They are very important. They allow good chest support, and stability for running. You have less air intake. - Why? - Well you have small shoulders. But that's not all that matters. - I'm standing straight. - You are shaking. - No I'm not. - It must be my hand, then. Show me your calves. Go ahead! Those are the triceps surae muscles, there. They are essential. They give good power of propulsion, and better rebound on the track. Your legs are good. They're thin which is good for long distances. Especially if you want to go up to 800 or 1500. I think you have the stamina. What you lack is power. Here, look. Lay your neck there. Go ahead, push! This will make you work. Push hard, I will resist. More power, come on! Come on! - I'm pushing. - Come on. Come on, push. I've done this before. I haven't. Me neither, actually. - You okay? - Yes. It was good. It gave me an incredible feeling. Stop, it's like you're talking about a race - But it's similar. - Stop. You know, I read an article... about Eastern Germany's female swimmers. It seems they did it on purpose. On purpose to get pregnant. That way they produce more hormones. Well, hormones or whatever it is, I'm not sure. And then, that way they are stronger. And they swim faster. Like real fish. You see how it's similar? We can compare, it's comparable. Sorry, but I don't understand. Me, I understand. I'll show you the article, if you want. - You shouldn't get upset. - Do I look upset? No, but you're breathing weirdly. What are you talking to me about, here? - Well, you got it. - Wait. Did you sleep with me just to get pregnant? Well you know full well that I don't take the pill. Are you crazy? It's not good to be on the pill, you know? No, wait. Did you sleep with me to get pregnant? And if you have a baby, what do you do then? I don't know. I'll abort after the championship. If I'm pregnant, I could improve my performance. I could train harder... ..and longer. You want to be pregnant just for a race? - Yes. - Yes? If you have a baby, you know I'll be the father? - What? - What? You're sick. I can't stand this. I can't make a baby for a girl to abort! Fuck! Who said anything about a baby? You're sick. Tell me you're not serious! But you helped me like this. You helped me. You helped me. You disgust me. Get out! Come on, fuck, get lost! You take your things and you leave. Don't look at me, or call me anymore! I swear if you get pregnant... Shit! Never again, you hear? Never count on me anymore. Come on, get out, get out, get out! Hurry up please, hurry up and leave. Come on! Hop hop hop! You won't let me go... You won't let me go... What is that? You want me to eat you up? You want me to eat you up? You want me to eat you up? No. Get up. Get up. Forgive me... Sandrine, don't slow down at the end. It's useless. Keep the speed until the end. Come on! Dani. Dani... Fatya. Dani has disappeared. Dani has disappeared, I'm telling you. - So what? - So, where is she? - I don't know. - You think she felt unwell again? I don't know. Maybe she went home. Why would she do that? Maybe you gave her the idea. - Me? - Yes, you. And since when do you care about others? I'm telling you, I won't run. - Hurry up! - I won't run. Hush. Hush, I said. Are you scared? - You okay? - Yeah. - We made it this time. - Yeah. I'm scared shitless. It's only normal. We all are. - Are the 800 done? - Yes, they passed. - You okay? - Yeah, kinda. You? - You're not too stressed, are you? - No. - And your butt hamstring, good? - It's been a month, yes it's good. Come on, let's go, let's go!! Sabine! - Gotta go, Sabine. - Sabine? Roderer... Sabine. You okay? I don't think I want to go anymore. You're blocking, but it's normal. This is a good sign. Proves you're ready - Are you sure? - Absolutely. I almost don't recognize you. Me neither. Sabine! Sabine! Next race, 400 meters, women. The line-up... Lane No. 1, Coralie Zimmerman. Lane 2, Eve Darieux. Lane 3, Sabine Roderer. Hey, Sabine! 400 meters, women. Attention, starting. On your marks! Ready! Subtitles by: hautbasfragile @KG
