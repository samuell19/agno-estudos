See, I'm on your side, I always say every family needs at least one hard core gangsta in it, ya know? Right? - Don, leave her alone. You used to like rap music. - I'm all for it, that's what I'm saying. You know, I mean hey, look at me. I loved rap music back in the day, and now living large, G.O. Managing the front desk of a hotel but, it could be worse, right? I mean hey.

Something's not right about clowns. [laughing] Maybe it's all them white faces. - Yeah, that must be it. - You know what they say though, black is beautiful, tan is grand, but white's still the color of the big boss man. [laughing] - Is that what they say, huh? - That's right. - I've heard that a few times. - That so mister boss man? - You'd be the truth. Yes sir. [laughing] - What about you, any plans for the weekend? - Well I think on Sunday we're gonna barbecue for that Cowboys game, course you guys are welcome to come by if you want to. - Wow, that sounds like a plan. Hey, I'll get Mama to make some of her world famous potato salad. You know she won a prize over at the fair with that thing. - Yeah, we've heard that story a few times. - Don't go out of your way or anything. - I'll have to check my busy schedule first. - What? Your playboy lifestyle getting in the way of barbecues now, TC? - Yeah, that plus your wife's potato salad tastes like shit. - Well I'll be. - It does. - I've been eating that stuff for 30 years. - We don't lie to you. - It's honesty. - You know, you really haven't done too bad for yourself. Two perfect children. [clicks tongue] A loving, drop dead gorgeous wife. A gorgeous wife, a nice house. - You're right, you're right. - Yeah, things could always be worse. - I know. You are right. Listen, okay? Just some days I gotta tell ya. I wake up and I feel suffocated, okay? Like ah, it's like being buried under mountains of, of stress and, bills and, I mean I remember when we used to really have fun, right? - You remember that, don't you? - Yeah. - I mean I remember when I looked forward to every day. It was an adventure. Now it's like every day is more of the same. Spinning my wheels, worry, losing sleep. Sometimes I don't even feel like I even wake up. Does that make any sense? Yeah, it does Don, but I think everybody feels like that at times. - You know, you're right. I am grateful. Things are not that bad. When I think of you, and the rugrats in there, it makes me happy, really happy. I mean if I didn't have y'all, I wouldn't be anything. If I didn't have y'all, well I wouldn't even want to be alive. [hammering] [elephants trumpeting] [giggles] She was smiling. - Yeah, she smiled at you 'cause you're standing in shit. - Puta madre. Check this shit out. - What's that, a tarot card? - No man, it's a playing card. Me and my grandma used to play this game with this man when I was a kid. It's like bingo but from Mexico. - So why is there a devil on there? - [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] - English? - Behave yourself, or the little red one will carry you away, the devil. - Ah. - Yeah. * I am dreaming dear of you [screaming] * Still I wonder all in dreams * In the land of muck it seems * Just with you [muffled screaming] - Hi.

[giggling] - Hey Hillary, maybe one of the clowns will wanna be your boyfriend, then you can get married and have little clown babies. - Mom! - Alyssa Ann, be nice to your sister. Clown babies, really Alyssa? - Sounds kinda funny myself. - Don, don't you encourage them. - Mom, Alyssa's making a face at me. - Girls, circus, fun, please!

Here you are. - Running a little bit short on help? - I'm sorry? - Short on help, you know? - Oh, you've made a joke at the expense of someone differently abled, how clever you are. But for your information, Mr. Jumbo suffers from a growth hormone deficiency known as dwarfism. However the last I checked, his sense of humor was quite intact and I'm sure he will find your joke amusing. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to be disrespectful. - I'm yanking your chain, Donald, he's a dwarf. Who gives a fuck what he thinks? [laughing] Oh, you forgot your address. - Is that really necessary? - Yes if you're going to come by for dinner it is. Government regulation, I know man, just a formality, trying to do my job. - There you go. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Well now. - Donald. Adios. Happy trails, until we meet again. - It's been a pleasure. - You and your family enjoy the rest of the evening. - Well I mean we have all this stuff to go home to. - Yes. - [Ringmaster] Let's hear it for the winner, [mumbles]! You rang? - It's that time. - Same as Dallas? - Yes. Although this time let's try to be a bit more incognito, shall we? [applause] - What is this?

We used to be married, remember? I don't care if it's. Hello? Hello? How'd you like the circus, buddy? - Pull over! [screaming] - What the hell? - Pull over now! - Okay, okay. [eerie music] - Listen Noodledome. Please remind me to explain to Mister Blister the meaning of the word incognito. [laughing] - You want the car? Take it, take it, please. Just don't hurt my son. - Paging Dr. Noodledome for an extraction! [suspenseful music] - No, no, no, no! [squeaks] Oh no, no, no, no! [laughing] [ominous music] [screams] - Jesus TC. What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? - I'm sorry. Will you ever forgive me? - No. - How 'bout now? [sultry music] - Maybe. [giggles] We can't do this anymore. I just feel so bad. I thought it would be easier to leave him. - I know. I know it's hard. But what's the alternative? Not be together? - I really have fallen for you. - I know. [creepy music] - Come to Papa. [heavy breathing] Can the coo cunt. Can the coo. It wants the clown. It wants the clown. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come to the circus, bitch. Come to the circus, bitch!

[screaming] Hillary? Alyssa? Girls! [laughing] [screaming] [intense music] [laughing] - Sweet dreams, Don. [sawing] [laughing] [exciting music] - We begin with breaking news out of Odessa. Two people have been found dead, the apparent victims of a kidnapping gone awry. We go now live to News 7's Linda Ito. Linda? - Channel 7 was first on the scene of what police are calling a gruesome discovery. Investigators are tight lipped but we're being told that this is the home of Donald and Tiffany Johnson, and their two children. - Hey guys. Found the wife's cell phone. - Let's see if we can find out where the husband's at. - Yeah. [phone ringing] What in the? [speaking Spanish] [laughing] [muffled yells] Oh my God! No! No! [giggling] - [Stagehand] Better get 'em on, you got 10 minutes. 10 minutes, Pappy. - Rise and shine, asshole. Have a seat, dickhead. - I see you boys have already met. May I formally introduce you? Donald, the formerly motor mouth asshole you see before you is Brandon! Who's come a long, long way on his journey of self-discovery, haven't you? In fact, Brandon not only played with the babysitter but he lived to tell the tale, didn't you Brandon? Didn't you Brandon, didn't you Brandon? Yes? Yes? Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did. You asshole. Brandon. The excellent excuse for birth control you see before you is the Donald. Donald, who had it all. The perfect life, everything a man could want. Beautiful home. Two lovely daughters. Wonderful wife, well, he had a wonderful wife. [muffled screaming] Calm down Bucko, she had it coming. She had it coming. She was dipping in the chocolate. You mean to tell me you didn't notice her love tunnel's recent expansion from two lanes to six? If I was a betting man, and I am. I'd say she's been bumpin' uglies with Mighty Joe Young for months. What's the matter? Yes, can't believe your wonderful, saintly wife would violate the sacred vows of holy matrimony, hmm? Oh, get real, Donald. In marriage you're either the fucker or the fuckee. I guess we know which one he was. Why listen to me, buddy? I'm just a clown. Who the hell cares what I think? Why don't you ask her yourself? [screaming and crying] [laughing] Donald, Donald, Donald, don't you love me? I still love you. I still love you. Yes I do. Yes I do. Yes I do. Yes I do. Love will save the day. Love is all we need. Love, love, love, love! [muffled screaming and crying] What's the matter? You've lost that lovin' feelin'? Too bad I haven't. [moaning] Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Yeah. [shouting] She wasn't that good. [laughing] [cheering] [upbeat music] - Showtime, shitface. [exciting music] - We have the very latest on the story out of Odessa. Two people dead, three missing, two of them young girls, and now we have just learned the identity of the two dead. One, a local police officer, 28 year old Thomas Dwayne Carter. Now Carter was a decorated law man and a six year veteran of the force. The second victim, 35 year old Tiffany Sinclair Johnson. Johnson is the mother of two missing girls, 14 year old Alyssa and 10 year old Hillary Johnson. Now police are looking for these two young girls as well as their father, Donald Arthur Johnson. Officers believe that his reappearance could lead to the whereabouts of his missing children. Ladies and gentlemen allow me to present to you would you believe that justice will be served here tonight? No! You heard them! [heavy music] [cheering] - What a marvelous crowd, what a marvelous show. Shall I use the prod? Now, Donald, you and I must talk. Let us talk. Can we talk? Can we talk? Shall we talk? I am listening, I am listening. [muffled yells] Oh yes, of course. Try now. - My kids. My girls okay? - Your daughters. Such delicious girls. - You sick fuck! If you lay a hand on one of my kids, I swear to god! - Relax, they're fine. For now. But that's where things can get a bit tricky. - I'll do anything, anything you want, just don't hurt my kids. - That's good. That's very good, Donald, that's exactly what I wanted to hear you say. - I wanna see 'em. How do I even know if they're okay? - Yes, good question. Good question, let me see. They're not here, they're with the babysitter, but, I happen to have a video postcard that daddy's precious little angels made just for you. Now. Let me see. Boop! Boop! [screaming] Sorry, that's not it. Ooh, no, not that one. Oh, here we are. [screaming] [laughing] - Stop it, no! - Well you're a lucky man, Donald. You still have two left to fight for. Now, listen to me, carefully. If you do what I say, no matter what I say, I promise you that you will see your daughters again. And why,why, why should I believe you? - Because you don't have a choice. I hold all the cards. Play the game. And I promise you that you'll see your daughters again. Don't play the game, and I promise you that I will cut them into 100 pieces and feed what is left to Noodledome myself. Do you understand? - Okay. - Look on the bright side, Donald. I may be a homicidal serial rapist whose day job happens to be a clown, but I'm not a liar. My word is my bond. Clown's honor. Ew. So, yes? Yes? - Okay. But are they safe, are they really safe? - Yes. Yes, but if I or one of my associates were to open a certain door, let's just say we wouldn't want that to happen. - Why? - Because behind that door is one of my favorite creations. We call him Dollboy. So, enough chitchat. Let's play the game. Gentlemen, start your engines! [laughing] [hard rock music] I'm good. [upbeat Latin music] - Whoa, is the circus in town? - Sit down, sit down. - Can I help you find anything? - Yes, yes you can. - And what might that be? - Well, that depends, Rose. - [Rose] Depends on what? [video game music] - [Video Game Announcer] You are lucky! I am Nami! [laughing] - Hi, can I help you? Do you need help? If there's anything I can do for you just let me know. - You know, my brother is deathly afraid of clowns. - Is that a fact? - Uh huh, I mean like every time he sees one he totally freaks out. I think there's a word for that, right? - Yes. The technical term. - Yes? - It's called quit being a bitch isitus. [laughs] - That's funny. I'll be sure and tell him that next time I see him. What, what are those? Tarot cards or something? - No, it's like bingo but from Mexico. Now, for instance this is la rosa. The beauty of the rose. - I love roses, I even have this rose tattoo. - I see. But unfortunately Rose, that's not a good thing. - Why not? - Whoa. That's something you don't see every day. Hey darling. - Hi Paul. - Hope the goddamn circus is in town. [whistles] Well you're a big one, ain't ya Hoss? Well fuck you very much. - That's Paul Skullet, I'm not sure why they call him Paul but I know they call him Skullet 'cause he's got, you know, a skullet. It's like a mullet but bald in the front, party in the back. - Hey Joe, what are you doing back there? [shushing] Did you see all these goddamn clowns out here? Hey man, they're just fucking clowns. [hits] - What was that? Nothing that's gonna matter to you in about five minutes. [screaming] [crying] - What are you gonna do? Are you gonna rob me? [screaming] - I don't want your money. [screaming] - [Video Game Voice] You are sweet. - Thank you baby. [laughing] [groaning] - [Video Game Voice] Love me. - Oh I'd fuck that. [gunshots] - Here fishy fishy fishy fishy. [gunshot] - No! [gunshots] Naughty. - Dirty whore. [screaming and crying] Rose. It's time for the money shot. Mr. Noodledome. Could you bring Donald, please? Unlock him. - No. - You wanna see your daughters again? Then kill this woman. No. [crying] Take the gun. Put it in her mouth, pull the trigger. - I'm not gonna shoot her, man. - Donald! I'm not gonna say it twice. Rose here is already dead. But your daughters don't have to be. Your choice. - I don't wanna hurt anybody, please don't make me! - I'm not making you do anything. You're choosing this. You're choosing this because you love your daughters more than Rose here. First time is the hardest. First cut is the deepest. Let me help you, here. Ah, open your mouth and say ah. Open your mouth and say ah. Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh. Donald! Relax your elbow. Feels good, doesn't it? What do you say, Donald? Let's play god. - Please, please stop! [gunshot] I'm so sorry. - She can't hear you Donald. She's dead. Alright. Time to go. Take what you want and don't forget the gas. "Change" [country music] * You know there's something I want you to taste * Taste the pistol night * And there's something I want you to kiss * Kiss the pain right now * Right now [heavy metal music] [whistles] [screaming and crying] - Still no word tonight on the whereabouts of Alyssa, Hillary, and their father Donald Johnson.

[gunshot] - Now we are being told by local police that the gun of slain officer Thomas Carter was found at the murder scene.

I'm gonna rape her, slit her throat, and feed what's left to Noodledome to play with. You got a better suggestion? - Just let her go. Don't kill her man. She doesn't deserve to die. - How do you know? - I just know. - You just know? You just know. That's cute. Donald. From the first sin on earth we all deserved to die. We are by accident. Accident.

I've done everything! Everything that you asked me to do! [laughing] - I didn't ask you to shoot me. You thought of that all by yourself. But I am proud of you. You've done everything that I ask, and you've killed a lot of people in the process. You done good. - Then it's over? Is it over? - Not yet. [blows whistle] [chainsaw rumbling] [screaming] Don't you love a happy ending? [knocking] Rise and shine Donald. It's your big day. I've got a big surprise for you. - Hey Dad.
