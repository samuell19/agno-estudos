My parents used to read me a good night story... every night before bed. I don't have any books so I'm happy to tell you this one. There was this girl who wanted to see this beach. And she was in the middle of the country. And she had to travel three days to get to this beach. And this beach had magical sand. And it was purple and said to have healing powers. And even if you sprinkled it on your skin... it would heal all pain and sadness. And even the birds they... loved this beach. Emily? Just go outside and wait. We'll evacuate you to a shelter. Go outside and wait for us. Just go outside and wait. Just go outside and wait for us. It's nice outside. Take your mask off. Kate, Kate? Kate, are you reading me over?
