I wonder if I am wandering around the town or if the town itself is wandering. I'm a castaway who drifted to Tokyo about six months ago. I have no regular occupation at the moment. I was a school teacher when I lived in the country. I was also a writer for TV as I was asked to do some work by a friend who's a TV director. Then I fell in love with a girl who appeared on the program, and just when I started to think about marriage seriously, she ran away with another man. I sank into a sea of despair and wandered about. Then when I opened my eyes I was here. I'm no one in this place. I'm only a swimmer. Then I thought, "I need to know someone." So I decided to follow someone I found in town. I call myself an observer of Unidentified Followed Objects. And the object is always there. IYARASHII HITOZUMA NURERU (Love - Zero = Infinity) It's OK if you don't believe me. But there's no other way to describe it. I believe you. 'Unidentified Followed Object' is funny. But this is my spot. Leave me alone. You're a selfish individual. - If I'm selfish... - It's my privilege to be selfish. Here. Enough? Do you know each other? Yeah. This is our secret garden. There's nothing for it. You followed me and found it. It's cheap if you think of it as a fee for observing Unidentified Followed Objects. Do you know Blood Storm? Chi-ru, chi-ru, Michi-ru. Michi-ru, chi-ru. WARNING Look! There! There! A little more. Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Idiot! Idiot! What are you doing? Ah! A little more! Not yet! I told you not yet! You're crap. Some reports say that those dead bodies found with their blood drained were the victims of a vampire returned to modern times. What do you think? I don't give a shit. I want to get bitten by a vampire. Observer of Unidentified Followed Objects? You don't study UFO's, do you? He told me he follows strangers without permission. - He must be a detective then. - No. No one makes him do it. It's his hobby. I see. There are some strange people in Japan. Don't talk as if you were a foreigner. I'm a returnee from abroad. You're wacko, aren't you? You look totally Japanese. You're the one who's wacko. I said I'm back from abroad, it doesn't mean I'm claiming to be a foreigner. Learn to talk like a woman! What? You're annoying! Are you ill? I'll tell you about Blood Storm to cheer you up. There are special relationships like between lovers or mates, aren't there? We use this to take a little bit of our blood and inject it into the others blood vessel, as proof of a special relationship. The other's blood gets into my body. My blood gets into the other's body. It's sheer ecstasy. I don't need either drugs or sex. You know about AIDS, don't you? I watch TV. - You'll die. - I don't mind. Speed is everything to me. If I have to slow down, I'd rather die. - Do you mean you want to die? - I want to live. But living means running toward death, doesn't it? There was a student like you when I was teaching. He played saxophone in a brass band and was always practicing on the roof. One day one of his friends felt uneasy after hearing what sounded like screaming, and went up on the roof and found him lying there. He'd injected air into his vein. He was killed instantly, of course. He must've thrown away his saxophone in his convulsive fit as he died. It lay shattered on the ground. It became pieces of metal. How very touching. Shut up, brat! Who's the brat? Hey! 9948, 9948. What should I do? Ambulance! Hey! - Here, you're well enough to run. - What was wrong with you? Following people too much, right? Thanks for calling an ambulance, but I'm busy right now. Wait! Are you OK? It must be down to the cold and the fatigue. You must be Mr. Bessho. Yes. Have you forgotten me? I'm Dr. Kurebayashi Atsuo, the doctor at Tohto Hospital. Doctor from Tohto Hospital? I was the first doctor to examine you when you were brought in by ambulance. Although I handed you over to the doctor in charge after seeing your condition. I see. My mind was very hazy at the time and I don't remember. You were talking deliriously. Because of that, I found out that you're an Observer of Unidentified Followed Objects. Was I talking about it? There's something I'd like to ask you about. Would you listen to me? I'd like you to follow a woman who walks around in a coat wearing sunglasses. She's a physician, who's been employed as a guinea pig of steroid medicine for dermatology, which is my specialty. We would stop the doses if she showed unusual symptoms as a result of the medicines. But as she's somewhat highly-strung, and also due to anxiety brought about by her fear of our interruption of her treatment, and the pressures of her daily work as a doctor, she became addicted to the substance. You followed me because you were interested in me, didn't you? No. Why do you want to make it bright? Things are boring without shadows. - I want to see you. - Please answer my questions. You said something earlier. I was interested. That's all. That interest expresses a desire, right? I want to know someone. That interest must be directed towards achieving a sexual desire. That's only a theory. I think I was feeling with some part of my body that I was being followed. But I must have a sexual desire for you too, if I attracted your eyes knowing it. I can't see. We don't need to see. I like darkness. I'm me, and I'm nobody. I'm a woman without a face. In the darkness, my face has probably become your lover's face. My lover's dead. I see. I'm dead, too, then. Show me that face in death. You mustn't look into a dead person's eyes. Why is that? Because they are mere shadow. Because they are just wet glass balls. Take those off and look at me properly. You take them off. With your hands. The shock of the loss of your lover is still causing you after-effects. Are you saying that's the reason I couldn't do it? Don't talk as if you knew. She was only a kid of about 20 years old. Age doesn't matter. She was important to you, wasn't she? And you... Please don't tell me I'm like her. I hope you can forget about her. You know what they say about vampires, don't you? I don't know if it's because I've been tired recently, but she looks like a vampire to me. You know, with the black clothes and the sunglasses. That woman is kind of empty since the central part of herself collapsed. You obviously understand what my wife was like. I can watch her intently but I can't see her present state. That's why I have to rely on you. There was another reason I chose you. When you came into the hospital you gave a blood sample. It was tested and I'm afraid you're HIV positive. You have AIDS. Me? AIDS? Are you sure? When I found out, I wanted to give you something to live for, something you could be enthusiastic about. As I was watching your behavior, I found out what you were in to. It was my wife. She was what you could be enthusiastic about. This is Digitalis. You should take this when you're disappointed in life. You're not treating your wife as a human. You're treating her as a product. I'm... not a carrier of AIDS. Our relationship is no longer based on love. So we are not husband and wife anymore. But we are not lovers either. I'm looking at her through you. I'm only an observer like you now. What a parting gift. Digitalis. It's a poisonous plant and a cardio tonic drug is made from its powder. It's common name is 'Fox Glove'. Oh, here he comes. We're here to collect our pay for observing an observer of Unidentified Followed Objects. You're generous. We'll see you get our special service. Now. Hey, Mister. Come on. Hey! Hey! Don't tell me you're worried about your wife. Hey, come on! Hey, quick! Come on! Come on! I'm bored. I'm bored, too. Chiru, chiru. Michiru. Michiruchiru. Dead. Dead. It's a message. People in Tokyo are massacred. Who's the boy? That's me as a kid. The girl must be you. Were you so bored that you wanted to kill people? It was fun. But it was all black when everything was over. Black? Fade out. Everything was gone and when I looked around there was nobody. But I'm here. The observed object is a bloodsucking killer, who couldn't forgive the agency or the persons in charge of the sales corporation, which sold HIV-infected blood products, and killed both of them. The reason why the client didn't take any action himself, was simply because he couldn't bear finding out that his wife, who was physically and mentally twisted from taking steroid drugs over a long term, killed them. This looks like a public prosecutor's record. Are you taking the blame? Do you want to prosecute her? This is a matter of my wife's honor. Please don't call her a bloodsucking killer. You don't understand. My wife couldn't stand those creatures who didn't destroy HIV-infected blood products, but were happy to ship them to the market place. So she sucked the blood out of them, to the very last drop. In a way, she's a modern vampire. But that was done as revenge for the victims of the contaminated blood products, through the medium of my wife. You're not showing any side effects from the steroids, are you? That's because I'm relaxed by your being so pleasant. It was you not Kurebayashi who tore this up, wasn't it? Kurebayashi didn't deny this, did he? I see. So now I'm a bloodsucking killer then. That's right, isn't it? Do you know how much blood we need to lose to die? I know because I'm a doctor. And so is Kurebayashi. Are you saying that he killed them? It doesn't matter which of us did it. They're dead. They were killed by a vampire. Is the reason your body didn't show any strange reaction to the steroid, that you aren't involved with me as deeply as you are with Kurebayashi? That's why your nerves aren't set on edge and you don't show any allergic reactions. If that's true, you must still be deeply in love with Kurebayashi. Am I wrong? I'll suck out your despair. Chiru chiru michiru chiru, cherry blossoms fall. Chiru chiru michiru chiru, cherry blossoms fall. If cherry blossoms don't fall, Japan falls. If Japan doesn't fall, cherry blossoms fall. Chiru chiru michiru, michiru chiru. Oh, no, no. News flash. This afternoon, police received a phone call announcing a suicide, and officials have confirmed that a man has been found dead in a nearby flat. The man was identified as Kurebayashi Atsuo, a doctor at Tohto Hospital. The police are looking into the cause of death. Next news. I could sparkle just by being watched by you. I could live by being chased by you. But this time, run away please. Please run away from me. I'll chase you. I'll follow you everywhere, you know. Not bad. Hello, how are you feeling? It's small in here, but the town looks big. They've had it. Isn't this what people call 'double suicide'? I thought it only happened in the classics at school? Yeah, like in Chikamatsu Kadoemon. Idiot! It's Monzaemon! Is it? Hey, I've got a rush. - Let's have sex! - In here? Doing it in here is a turn on, isn't it? That's not the point. I've got something more exciting for you.
