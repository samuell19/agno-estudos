Constance, you're still here. I couldn't leave you, Daniel. He'll wonder where you were. He doesn't care about me. He's your husband. He's your brother. I have nothing else in my life. I can't lose you, Daniel. What are we? This is so wrong. I know. Can we cut?! Cut! That's a cut. Back to first positions. What is this? His lips? The lips are fine. They're fine. Could somebody please mop her down? It's not the lips, Harry. It's my face. I powdered it, Harry, I swear. The lights, Harry. You got a million watts all focused on my face. What are you, the lighting director now, Sydney? Harry, fix the light. I'll be in my trailer. Sydney! Brenda, call lunch, will you please? We already took lunch, Harry. Then, call dinner, call five, just get me a tranquilizer. That's a five, everybody. Let's not wander away from the set. Tell the actors to take five! Kill the fire! Give me a playback. She's killing me, Victor. It's the Pinocchio factor, Harry. What? The Pino-- never mind. The light? I checked the bridge. We were missing a gel. It was like a floodlight on Sydney's nose. What the hell is the Pinocchio factor? Her nose, Harry. She thinks her knows is too long. Code word-- Pinocchio factor. What about pain in the butt factor? You'd have to reshoot if she hadn't caught it. Well, fix it. Whatever you do, don't let her know she was right. Brenda, aspirin, fruit basket to Sydney's trailer, asap. Done. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, Ms. Clarke! I'm in Mississippi. I'm from Mississippi, too. I know, I know, me, too. Pushmataha. - Pushmataha. Sydney, we have to go inside. The editor's waiting for us. Um, I want to talk to you. Wait, I want to talk to her. I know she's from Mississippi, but she'll be there when you get out. OK, now, I'm going to go find McAndrew. You wait right here, OK? Just talked to the guys from studio. Yeah? They're ready to greenlight the script I wrote for us. All you have to do is say yes. I told you, I don't like the role. Sweetheart, this is a chance for us to work together again. They're willing to hold up the start date till after the honeymoon. Ryan, I've played a psychopath in two of my last three movies. He's I'm beginning to worry what that says about me. Just read it one more time. Ryan. Fine. Sydney, I found him. Come on. Ryan, you stay. The curator's name is McAndrew, and I've just talked him into going national for this spot. The art gallery spot is beautiful. And here is the wedding spread the "Puree." Ugh. Fran, we don't need any more publicity. This wedding is going to be a media circus as it is. The event, darling-- the event of the century. Wish we could just elope. Elope? Sydney, you're a star. You're royalty. People want to know every detail, and we are not going to disappoint them. What's the matter, honey? I don't know. Maybe just jitters. But everyone gets that jitters. I don't know why we're getting married in the first place. You're a great couple. The press loves you. Now, Harry says he's found the perfect location for the cabin scene, and there's a four star hotel right on the lake. I don't know why we have to go to location, Fran. It's a colossal pain. It's almost May. There's not going to be any snow in New England in May. He's just looking for authenticity. That's not so bad. They're expecting a freak storm. Yeah, well, they'll get their freak storm when Harry gets there, that's for sure. Oh, stop pouting. Harry's film means a shot at a nomination-- Right, Ginger? Oh, absolutely. --better parts, better money. I already got an offer from the studio at double your fee. A comedy? Another psychopath, but Sydney, who cares? It's double the money. Double the money! And as your best friend, I advise you to take it. Oh, how many best friends do you know get 10%? All right, as your manager, I advise you to stay on track. Just look through these tonight, so I can at least get the agents off my back. Oh, flight at 7:00, limo at 5:00. And don't worry about the snow in New England. You'll have snow up to your wazoo, and it will be the real stuff. Yeah. Action on the snow! Action on the camera! [crying] Don't cry, mother. Oh, I can't help it, Miles. If I don't marry Nathaniel, I-- oops, Daniel. Cut! Cut! Miles! I didn't screw up. She did. Camera, you call that a dolly movement? It was pathetic. OK, cut the machines. I said turn off the machines now. Doesn't look like a snowstorm, Harry. It looks like a dandruff commercial. Didn't your weather man call for snow today? Yes, he did. He called for it yesterday, he's calling for it tomorrow. The guy is a liar. - We're into overtime, Harry. - Get me a Valium. None left. Is there an aspirin? - We're out. - That's it. Let's wrap. We're going back to LA. That's a wrap, people! Thank you! Harry, you're kidding me, right? Don't start with me, Sydney. You're flying me 3,500 miles to wait for snow when we could have gone 60 miles to Big Bear or Arrowhead or the 10 other mountains in California. Now, you want to turn around and fly back to LA? I can't make it snow, Sydney. I'm not god. Have you ever heard of snow blowers, Harry? They make snow, real snow, not potato chips. Of course, it's 82 degrees. We can't make snow now, can we, Harry? Give it a rest, Sydney. We will shoot the snow after the next location. You want to shoot the snow, you do it without me. Call Glenn Close. That's who you wanted in the first place. Sydney, come back, darling. Please come back. Look, try and keep it together. We'll find the snow. The writer will make the adjustments. It will turn out fine. It will turn out fine. What's it, Harry? Another pointless film that no one will remember? Sydney, the public buys tickets to see you. We film this, we film that. In the end, it doesn't matter. Oh, god, nothing ever matters. When will it matter? I keep waiting to see what that feels like. Sydney, come back, darling. Sydney, please come back. Syd? Oh, we were rehearsing. She's your stand-in. It makes sense, Sydney. Sydney! Sydney. Sydney, your coat. It's raining. She's going into the woods. Should I go after her? The hotel's 500 yards away. Let her go. If we're lucky, there'll be some big, hairy, hungry thing in there. Brenda, do you not have anything? Midol? Sold. I'm watching it right now. It's fabulous. Oh, Quentin, she's perfect. Fran, it's Harry's office. I'm busy. - You should take it. - I'll call them back. Comprende? Sydney's walked again. Quentin, I'll call you back. Harry, how's my favorite director? You did what? Oh, my god. They've lost Sydney in the woods. They sent out a search party. Harry, are you crazy? Bigfoot's probably eaten her by now. Find her! Sydney, you're such an idiot. Idiot, idiot, idiot! To be or not to be an idiot! OK, OK. You can do this. You can do this. Oh, oh. Which way is up, and which way is down? Oh, god, I think I'm losing it. Oh, I don't believe you did this, Sydney. You're an idiot. You walk off a movie in Manhattan. Walk off a movie in Beverly Hills. You can't walk off a movie in a god forsaken mountainside in the middle of nowhere. Oh, oh, oh. Wait until the Actors Guild hears about this. Oh. Ooh. Oh, oh, oh. [truck horn honking] [car sounds] Oh, hello? Hello? Hello! Hello! Help! Hello! Stop! Help! Stop! Help me, please! Stop! Lady with a baby! Help! No, wait. [grunting and screaming] Oh, oh. This one's mine! You take the next one! Where you headed? What's the name of that town? Deerfield? Deerfield? Lady, that's back over the mouth. I'm headed to Lincoln, about two hours away. Take it or leave it. What, I can't even ride in the back of the truck? No honor among hitchhikers anymore. Might as well take the damn bus. What's that over there? That's the Lincoln steel mill. We're coming into town now. Thanks a lot. Oh, dear. Mommy, is that a bag lady? Good morning. Morning. He picked up his spare. Ooh, Joycee, he's on fire. What's he at? He's gonna nail a 650 series, for sure. Who's this? She could bowl in our bag lady league. Answering machine. It's 4:00 in the morning in LA. Fran, it's me. Don't call out the National Guard, I'm all right. But don't tell Harry or Ryan. Tell them that I am lost and feared dead. Actually, don't tell-- don't tell Harry that. He'll get Glenn Close. I'm coming home. I've got to, um-- actually, I can't come home. I need to get money. You've got to get Fred to wire me some money. I'm in, um-- I don't know what the hell this place is. I can't read the number on the telephone. So I'll call you back. Never mind. Bye. Get the money up front. Coffee? - Yes, please. - Cream and sugar? Just a little cream. It's 7:00 in the morning, who's bowling? That's the Midnight Humpers versus the Dawn Patrol. The Midnight Humpers? Yeah. It's the guys coming off the midnight shift at the mill against the guys coming on the 8 o'clock shift. They've got an hour off, and they're bowling? Are you kidding? These guys bowl in their sleep. They bowl for their wedding receptions. We've got a bar mitzvah bowl. I'm in bowl hell. Can I ask you a question? Shoot. What are these weird things behind me? You mean the bowlers? No, I mean the skinny pins and the tiny balls. Oh. Candlepin. It's an east coast thing. It's English. Can I get you anything else? A plane ticket out of here. Did I mention that I have no money? The coffee I can get you on the house, but you're on your own for the plane ticket. Thank you. You in some kind of trouble? Now, why would you think that? You want to talk about it. No. OK. You can use the phone in the office for free. I don't know who I'd call. That's trouble, all right. Look, um, for starters, how about I loan you some clothes? You would loan me clothes? Why would you loan me clothes? Because you need them. Joycee. Get rid of her. She's a bag lady. She's not a bag lady. She's broke. She's wearing baggy clothes. She's a bag lady. It's a new look. It's that Elizabethan thing. OK, we are RSVPed yes to the Streisand-Lockett party-- Fran. --no to the Thanksgiving Day Parade? Who were they kidding? Fran, listen-- And a maybe to the Ozone Replenishment Benefit. - Fran, Sydney called. - What? Yeah, she left a message. She doesn't know the name of the town she's in. She doesn't have any money. And she didn't know the number that she was calling from. But she's going to call back. - Oh, that's insane. - So what's new? - OK, zip it. Get me Harry on the phone, and then get me the studio. No, no, Harry already called. He knew she was there, was because some gas station attendant saw her with a truck driver. A truck driver? For her? - I'll call the studio. Yeah. Anyone ever tell you, you look like Sandra Bullock? I don't think I look anything like Sandra Bullock. Hmm. Well, her, or a little bit like that actress, Sydney Clarke. Except for the blond hair and those poofy lips. She had them injected with sheep fat, you know? Oh, she did not. I read it in a magazine. It's true. So what is your name? Uh, Cheryl. Cheryl Belson. Well, it's nice to meet you, Cheryl. I'm Joyce McMurphy. You, too. Cheryl, promise me one thing. What? That one day you'll tell me about that dress, and the last couple of days. It's a long story, but I will. WALTER: I don't know what you're doing in there, Joycee, but we're backed up out here! Come on. Only cook it once, kiddo. I know, I know. All cooks are the same. A persnickety group of people. Cheryl, hold your arm up. Palms up. Thank you. Well, what-- what are you doing? Do me a favor, run this down to lane three. Me? Oh, I don't think so. What's your problem? You're asking me to wait tables? No, I'm asking you to do me a favor. How's a person supposed to carry all this? Haven't you ever heard of a tray? Yeah, sure. There you go. - OK. Go, lane three. Lose the attitude, you might get a tip. Yes! Ha ha, see ya later. See ya later, buddy. Can somebody give me a hand, please? Save my drink! Save my-- Hang on, we got them. We got them. Oh, thank you. How much we owe you? I don't know. I'm not a waitress. Well, that's apparent. Hey, Joyce! How much? Uh, $10.50. Ten, fifty. Ah, the Bill Gates of bowling. Tipping is not a city in China, you know? That's good. Thank you, Peaches. Cheryl, and I'm leaving tomorrow. - I wasn't asking. - Yes, you were. What's your hurry? Hard to make a living here. You're telling me. Maybe you're in the wrong line of work. You got that right. So stick around anyway. Now, why would I want to do that? Because I'm here. That's why I'm leaving. Youch! Chewed him up and spit him out. That hurt. Total annihilation, brother. Yeah, you want to know something? She really likes me. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Lot of houses for sale. Well, people are scared. Every time there's another rumor about the mill closing, somebody leaves - Lock up, will you, Joycee? - Sure, no problem. Good night, Walter. - Thanks. You don't mind if I hang here until the rain stops, do you? No, not at all. Um, but can you give me a hand, or are you going to stand there like the Queen of England and watch me drop this stuff? - Sure. What do you need me to do. I'm just kidding ya. Here, take this, push A1 on the jukebox. Ooh, I can handle that. Good. So where are you from, Cheryl. Mississippi. Pushmataha. I thought I heard an accent. How did you wind up here? Sort of walked off a job. That's a hell of a long walk. [music from jukebox] Oh! I used to love this song! Yeah, me, too. Every time we heard this song, we had to jitterbug to this. - Oh, yeah? - Ooh, come dance with me. - Cut it out. - Oh, come on. Put that down. Whoo! I don't do this very well. BOTH: [singing] I'll always love you, always love you. - Get ready now. - What? Whoo! Ah! [crashing sounds] I'll get my crutches. Hang on! Wait, wait, wait, don't move without me. - I'm fine. - Just a second. I'm fine. Ow! - Oh, Joyce, I'm so sorry. - It's OK. I just bumped it. - Are you OK? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Just grab my bag. Thank you. All right, take it easy. Slow! Joyce, wait a second. I've got it. I've got it. Have you got it? I can't remember when I've had so much fun. I'm so sorry. If you say you're sorry one more time, I will whack you, OK? Easy. So where you going to stay tonight? I haven't figured that out yet. Well, you're welcome to stay on my couch. Joyce, you're such a nice person. I don't know what to make of it. Are you sure you're not southern? If that means thank you, you're welcome. Door's unlocked. No, we don't lock it. Oh, small town. I love it. How do you feel? I'll live. Can I see that? - Sure. Thanks. That is so good. Thank you. Is that what you do back in Pushmahooha? Pushmataha. No. Worked at a tropical fish store. That's the job you walked out on? The guppies got to you, huh? No, the piranhas, not to mention a cheating fiance. Ouch. So now what'll you do? I mean, what would you like to do if you had your choice? Ooh, what a question. If I could do anything, what would I do? 36 years old, and I don't know the answer to that. Can I give you a little advice? Sure. I don't think you're quite cut out to wait tables. No kidding. I like my food brought to me, thank you very much. What about you? You gonna hang out with the Midnight Humpers the rest of your life? - No, actually. Someday I'd like to open up a little cafe down by the lake, own my own business. What a wonderful idea. Why don't you do that? Risky. Mill closes down, so does everything else. Well, risks are meant to be taken, right? Well, one step at a time, if I'm lucky. First, I gotta figure out how to wait tables walking on my hands. I gotta figure out how to get out of here, no offense. Where is the nearest big airport? Boston. OK, I have friends in Boston. How do I get to Boston? Do I take a train, bus? What? We got a train station. Train leaves tonight, I think around 8 o'clock. Oh, I just have one little problem. Oh. Joyce, I don't know how to thank you. Would you stop it? Just keep it. I practically break your foot off, and you lend me a week's worth of tips. Cheryl, the way I was raised, somebody needs help, you give it to them. You'll pay me back. You've got my address. - Sure. Thank you. I'll get your clothes back to you right away. Promise. Did I mention the interest payments? I gotta get back to work. Thank you so much. I'll be in touch. You take care. Yeah, you, too. See ya. Bye. This train should be here any minute. Where you heading? Not me. My daughter's coming home. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah, she's 33 now. I haven't seen her for almost four years. Nothing's better than coming home. She must have traveled a lot, huh? Oh, there's been a place or two. Greece, the island of Crete, Italy, Switzerland. Well, most of Europe, really. England, as far up as Norway. Oh, that's not counting the Arctics, both up and down. It sounds adventurous. She went everywhere. But the best place is home, where people love you, where they care about you. Well, she's home. Enjoy the visit. Oh, my god. Otis and Kirby, order's up! Come get it! There you go. Tell you what, Kirby. I'll carry yours, you carry mine. That way, it'll still feel like someone brung it to us. Good idea. Very funny, boys. Two Stooges of bowling. She's back. Fran, you're never there. It's Sydney. Listen, I'm not going to come back right away. I gotta-- I gotta-- I don't know what I gotta do. Something. I'll-- I'll call you in a few days. Bye. Hey. Hey. You all right? I don't know. I thought you were going home. Right now, here seems better than there. OK. Well, what are we going to do with you, then? Besides fish food, what have you done? What have I done? You mean work? Yeah, work. I think we've exhausted the waitress thing. Yeah. Well, I've-- I've done a lot of things. When I was a teenager, I flipped burgers. Mm-hmm. I was a nurse's aid once, sort of. That's how you knew to put ice on my foot. Yeah. I tell you what, my friend, Darlene, is the nurse at the mill, and she is dying to visit her sister in Florida. Oh, I don't know. You could cover for her during her vacation. The pay's pretty good. I can't do that. Just till she gets back. Look, it'll put money in your pocket, get your confidence back. I'm going to set it up right now. All you gotta do is turn on the boss. Gonna get along great. I know we have to make this shipment, but I can't speed it up without slacking on safety, and I'm not going to do that. Mr. Cameron? Peaches. Well, I thought you were leaving town. - You're the boss? - Yeah. Ben, remember? Yeah. Wow, a waitress, now a nurse. If this keeps up, you'll be mayor by the end of the week. Huh, Belson. Mississippi. Pushma-- Pushmataha. You know, I never actually met anyone from Mississippi before. Yeah? Well, most of us are wearing shoes now. We got indoor plumbing, too. You look very familiar. Huh. Let's see. Work history. Sold tropical fish supplies. Gourmet chef. Part time nurse. Well, actually, it was more like a nurse's aide. Well, how are you with splinters? That's about as serious as it gets around here. Of course, there was that one time that Guy Helier got decapitated with a hydraulic drill. You're kidding, right? Yeah. Very funny. Steel mill humor? You're hired. Just like that? Steel mill intuition. You got a certain big city something about you. But not entirely. I like it. I thought you were leaving town. I thought so, too. Well, lucky for us. Come on, Peaches, I'll show you around. The mill has six divisions, deploying over 1,000 men. This division makes steel products, bridges, stuff like that. Mm-hmm. My grandfather helped build this place in the '20s. - Did he really? - Yeah. The town was really prosperous then. Well, it seems busy enough now. Well, what you're seeing are guys working double shifts in order to keep the mill in the black. It's what everybody has to do these days to compete with foreign steel. The nurse's station and the lunch room are up there. Dick, this is Cheryl Belson. She'll be taking over for Darlene until she comes back. Hi. Nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Welcome. - Can you give us a second? - Oh, sure. No problem. Thank you. Ben, did you, uh-- did you send in that report to New York yet? No, I was hoping the output would improve this week, so I can send something more optimistic. Why? - Good. Because I wanted to go to the accounts receivable and see if I can shake loose a few dollars from some of these guys that owe to us, you know, and tip the numbers in our favor a little bit? - OK. - Good. Great. Hey, Dick, everything OK? I just got a call. Elaine fell again. That's my wife. She's been pretty sick. - Is she all right? - Well, nothing's broke. But I can't say she's OK. It's been a pretty tough go for the last two years. She's getting tired. Well, what are you doing here? Go be with her. Oh, I can't do that. You know what's on my desk. Look, If I need you, I'll call you. Go ahead. Go! Thanks, Ben. That was a nice thing to do. Well, I'm a nice guy. A lot of people I know who wouldn't have done that. It sounds like you're hanging out with the wrong crowd. Here's your office. What do you think? Looks like home to me. SYDNEY CLARKE [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: I don't know what I got to do. Something. I'll call you in a few days. Bye. In a few days. Get me the studio. Executives are going to be hemorrhaging all over the lot. Ryan's on two, and your mom's still on hold. Mom, hold on. Ryan? Oh, of course, she's coming. I talked to Sydney this morning. Everything will be fine. You, too. Kiss, kiss. I don't see any splinters, Otis. I don't know, I felt something. A metal filing, maybe? Let me get some aspirin. You can go back to work now. Well, what about checking out that splinter in my butt? Sit on a mirror and check it yourself. Sit on a mirror the check it yourself? What kind of nurse is that? Yeah! Ow. Come on in. Hey. You think about my idea? Ben, it doesn't work. Guys doing these jobs, they don't make enough money to buy back the plant. Hey, John, I need that mig gun by tomorrow! Where do you come up with these Wall Street strategies? Well, we got to do something. Relax, brother, they've been threatening to close this place down since we were kids. Yeah, well, this time it might happen. Look, just because they shut down Ithaca doesn't mean we're going down, too. Hey, you saved New Bedford, you'll save us as well. Stop worrying. Yeah. Hey, Ben, hit me long. Nice hands, Jimmy! Nice arm. You must have played. What, in college? A little bit. Where did he play? As a nurse, what would you prescribe for him? Stick to bowling. So uh, how is your first day going so far? Lot of aches and pains, twisted ankle. Drew the line at checking for hernias. Smart. So what are you going to do to celebrate? Celebrate? Yeah, you got a new job. A person gets a new job, they ought to celebrate. I don't have anything planned, really. Well, in that case, how about dinner at my house? You don't quit, do you? Well, I haven't heard you say no. And if I did? I'd be perfectly fine with it. Nah, I don't think so. Come on! You just got a new job! Ah, it's very sweet of you, I just don't think so. Oh, how do you say I don't think so. It's impossible. Just say yes. Come on, just yes. A simple yes. What else you gonna do? Who do-- what else you gonna do? Who do you know in town? OK. All right, already. As long as I don't have to carry more than one plate at a time. Actually, I was hoping you'd cook. I have to cook? Well, your resume says you're a gourmet chef. Besides, I got a couple of trout I caught yesterday. It needs a little loving hand, a little imagination, culinary skill. Where do you live? I'm staying at Joyce's. Really? Well, uh, I'll pick you up at 7:00. OK. See ya at 7:00. Great. I just don't understand how you could tell him you were a chef when you really weren't. Well, I wasn't lying. I just didn't stick with it for very long. Oh. You like him, don't you? Maybe. You want to try this-- ravishing red? Sure, I guess. I mean, I've never done them before. You've never done your nails before? In this color. Oh. Hey, this one might work-- flambe the trout. Simplemente to flambe. Ooh-la-la. And for your nails, I have the perfect color sweater. [doorbell ringing] Oh, that's probably Carter. Here you go. Hi. Hi. - How are you? - Good. How are you? I'm OK. Ah, the boyfriend. Carter, this is Cheryl Belson. She's visiting from somewhere in Mississippi. This is Carter. Yes, the boyfriend. It's so nice to meet you, Carter. Likewise. She is a bit like Sidney Clarke, but, uh, Sydney is a little more zaftig. Zaftig? It means chunky. I know what it means. Carter's the director of our community theater. Oh, how nice. Mmm, I'm holding auditions next week, "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Why don't you pop along? We'll see if we can fit you in? Oh, I don't know. I'm not much of an actress. Neither is Sydney Clarke. Never stopped her. I'll be there. I'm going to audition, too, and maybe this year I'll get something. We'll see you later, Cheryl. Don't wait up. I'm very impressed. You should be. It's a highly skilled operation. I just can't tell whether you know what you're doing, or you're the best con artist I've ever seen. If the con is done well enough, who's to say it isn't the truth? And what if you don't pull it off? The spell was broken. We're having a conversation, and I don't know what the hell we're talking about. You're driving me crazy. I have to check the trout. No, wait, the trout is fine. I have never seen such beautiful brown eyes in my life. On me, or the trout? Speaking of the trout, watch out. All right. Ooh-la-la. All right, very good. Hey, a bit of cognac. For medicinal purposes? And voila! Oh, here we go. [coughing] Oh! Is this what's supposed to happen? Oh! Oh, yeah, that's much better. You are the worst. What, you never had a smoked trout? Oh, my god. You OK? I'm fine. Really. A little humiliated, but fine. I'm sorry about the trout. I know you two were just starting to hit it off. I just feel lucky we're alive. I still have my home. Not worried about the trout. You like fudge? Love fudge. Do you have fudge? Do I have fudge? I made this. It happens to be the only thing I know how to cook. Is it good? Well, it beats the hell out of your trout. Wouldn't be hard. Mm-hmm. Your fish tank's not healthy. - Really? - Yep. Bringing up the fish tank at this particular moment is, uh, slightly frustrating. Well, I think we hardly know each other, and I don't fool around on the first date. Well, it's early. Come on, let's have our second date. Come on. You really love this town, don't you? Well, I grew up here. There's four generations of Camerons buried here. My mother and father are right over there. You loved them, too, huh? My parents? Yeah, well, they were my parents. What, you don't have warm feelings about Pushmata-- hari? Pushmataha. Would you guys give me a break? Just because you live in cliche-ville Lincoln. Jeez. Pushmawhatchacallit was wonderful. I loved it. I can't say the same thing about my father, unfortunately. He left when I was nine. Hmm, I guess I lived the American dream. You know what's great about you, Ben? Yeah. My broad shoulders and irresistible grin? No. You are who you are. Rock solid, genuine, straight forward. That sounds so boring. You know what I like about you? It's just the opposite. See, I-- I look at you and I see something more. I know there's something more. You got me curious. Is that something new for you, a woman who makes you curious? Well, maybe there was one or two when I lived in New York. You lived in New York? Yeah. You surprised? Yeah, I am a little. You didn't like the big city? No, it was all right. I just moved back when I had the chance. Never really felt right anywhere else. Whoa, do you see that falling star? Oh, yeah, you don't see those too often. Where I come from, you see them all the time. You cold? Yeah, I am a little bit. Thank you. So uh, what's your policy on third dates? Hi. Two, please. Enjoy the show. Yep. You want anything to eat? No, I'm OK right now. OK. Let's sit up on the stage. No, I like to sit right in the middle. Right here. Wow, such a control freak. Ah. What are you so happy about? Oh, I love this. It's just a movie theater. Ordinary and wonderful. Oh, well, you know, if it makes you so happy going to the movies, we should do it more often. I think this date is going really well. I'm having fun. So am I. NARRATOR [ON FILM]: Now, in the role you've been waiting for her to play-- Frankly, I need some help. NARRATOR [ON FILM]: --Sydney Clarke. I need someone who knows the game, and can point the way for me. NARRATOR [ON FILM]: Sydney Clarke, more beautiful and more dangerous than ever. SYDNEY CLARKE, AS CHERYL BELSON [VOICEOVER]: If the con is done well enough-- - Oh, my god. SYDNEY CLARKE, AS CHERYL BELSON [VOICEOVER]: --who's to say it isn't the truth? I could use a real friend right now. And I know that I can't just ask you to-- You're-- --drop everything and run up here, but. NARRATOR [ON FILM]: First, you see her, then you don't. And what happens in between will have you screaming bloody murder. Ben. NARRATOR [ON FILM]: No matter how many nightmares you've had, you'll never have ones like this. Ben. Well, I guess the joke's on me, huh? - Ben, come on. - Wow. Am I going to make the fan mags now? - Let me explain at least. - No, you got me. That was a good one. I mean, you really-- I got to hand it to you, you really did. - It's not like that. - Really? What is it like? What is it? Oh, it's an acting experiment. Is that what it is? Like, uh, research? You know, let's hang out with the little people? That's not what this is about. Then, what is it about? I just wanted to know what it felt like to be Cheryl Belson again. Oh. Oh, I see. So you, uh, what? You show up in some little hick town and look for the biggest sap in it? Is that what it is? Thanks for the date. Good morning. Good morning. Oh. You don't mind if I butt in, do you? Were you telling me something? My time card's gone. Yeah, I figured you had bigger and better things to do. OK. All right. But for the record, I didn't mean to hurt anyone, and I didn't mean to hurt you. I was doing my job here. I think I was doing it well. That was the idea, right? One more thing-- actors may get paid to play emotions, but they've got real ones, too. Don't slam that door. Here you go. Wow, that's amazing. Listen, I don't think Joyce is going to be back for at least 30 minutes. So if you want to wait, I'll make you a grilled cheese sandwich. Yeah, I'm not hungry. Thank you, though. Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Todd. Good morning. How ya doing, buddy? Ronnie. Mark. How you guys doing? I can see how this is going. Good morning, Kevin. Maybe I should try those wussy balls. Yeah, maybe you should. You waiting for this lane? The guys at the mill want you back. There you go. I have never had trouble at the box office. Yeah, they're actually threatening to go on strike unless you come back. Oh. Really? I am so flattered. Well, they are the only reason I'm here. So what do you say? You didn't tell them who I am, did you? How could I? How could I tell them that they're laying their jobs on the line for some Hollywood movie star? It's a joke. Thank you so much for stopping by. Yeah, my pleasure. Hey, can I just show you something for a second? Come here. Hold the ball like this. Now, you want to take four clean steps, and end up with enough room to slide up to the finish line, and end up with your thumb up by your nose. All right? Your right thumb. OK, go ahead. Yeah! Ha! That was really good. So what do you say? You coming back? Who's asking, you or the men? What's the difference? Tell me the answer and find out. Why is my fish tank so sick? You're such a coward. I know. So Sydney Clarke, huh? All right, you happy? - Yeah! - Yeah! Whoo! All right, let's get the worst over first. Come on, Otis. Yeah, I've already seen these. And if we show these to Remsberg, they're definitely going to shut us down. Well, that's why we don't show those to Remsberg. We show Remsberg these. What are these? Ever since the Ithaca plant closing, I've been inflating the numbers. Just enough, you know? Dick, if-- if they see these, you'll lose your job. Well, if they see these, we will all lose our jobs. You think those guys in New York care about this town, Ben? We're numbers. Look, I'm not proud of this, but I got 1,000 guys to worry about. Welcome home, pal. I don't know, Dick. Oh, yeah. How long you been married, Otis? Do we have to talk about that? I'm just wondering. 17 long years. You love each other? Oh-oh-oh. I know. I haven't figured it out either. It always starts out so good, and then ends up awful. Men and women, huh? What a mix. I wouldn't know where to start. Even if I did, I don't think she'd care. Well, I guess life's a gamble that way, huh? I suppose I could try. Start out small, bring her a little something, little present maybe. I used to do that. Yeah? Yeah. Back in the days when she'd rub away your aches and pains? OK, there you go. How's that shoulder now? It's better. Oh, uh, thank you for, you know, putting up with me. Friends? Yeah, as long as you do the splinter checks yourself. I'm gonna have to nominate her for nurse of the year. Hello. Hi. What's that? Special fish food. I used to that stuff, remember? Oh, yeah. Come on in. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. What, uh, exactly brings you to town anyway? I was shooting a movie. I walked off the set and blah, blah, blah, I ended up here. I'll tell you later, but your fish need me. Mm-hmm. They have ich. Ich? Fish disease. See, look, you have to raise the temperature and treat the water every time you change it. I brought the medicine, too, so. When do we start? Now. They're suffering. I'll show you. - I meant us. Well, you asked me who I thought I was, and I'm looking for an answer to that, too. Wish I had something profound to say, but I got a problem. I'm lost without a script. You asked me when do we start, and I'm asking you how. Well, it may be crazy, but I'd say now. And after giving your second question a considerable amount of thought, here's how. How happy some o'er other some can be. How happy some o'er other some can be! Through Athens, I am thought as fair as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so. What a person does for love. I can help you with that. Oh, I don't think anybody could help me. First, you have to answer the big question-- what does Helena want? - Want? - Not just want. Want, want, want! Because when you're working on a character in a play, you have to know what it is they want, so that you can want it, too. Otherwise, the lines you speak have no meaning. So you have to want it so much that you could just burst. Sounds like a lot of work. Well, yeah, it is. But I'll tell you a secret, Joyce, everybody in the world envies this, knowing what you want. Because they wish they knew, too. That's why they sit in an audience and watch, why they cannot take their eyes off you. We're talking community theater here. I love you, Joyce. Come here. I love you. OK. Ay, in the temple, in the town, in the field. You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal upon my sex. She's not very good. She's had the lead every year since Carter started directing here. What about you? I have never been cast. You're sleeping with the director and you've never been cast? Please. We cannot fight for love as men may do. We should be wooed, and we're not made to woo. I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand I love so well. CARTER HALE: Wonderful! Thank you. - He loved it. Go figure. I feel sorry for poor sucker who has to follow that. Uh, Joyce McMurphy. Break a leg. You prefer to take care of that, thank you very much. And you are? Carter. Joyce McMurphy. Began when ready. O, I am out of breath in this fond chase. The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, for she hath-- Thank you. That's very good. --blessed and-- Let her play the first fairy. How was I? Oh, very convincing. I wasn't too la-ti-da? Regal, no la-ti-da. Next, Cheryl Belson. OK, big shot. You get up there and don't pee your pants, I'll buy you a beer. Cheryl Belson, are you here? Well, listen, buster, you think I'm afraid of a 26-year-old executive? Yeah, well, that goes for 28-year-old lawyers, too. Well, you're just going to have to shoot around for a couple of days. What about reciprocity? She's had three hits in a row! Oh, they're going to sue the pantaloons off us. Sydney, wherever you are, I hope you're enjoying this! I just, uh, need a moment, please. What's here? A cup, closed around my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his-- what kind of end?-- Timeless. --timeless end. O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips Haply some-- what?-- Poison. --Haply some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm. Yea, noise? Then, I will be brief. O happy dagger-- Give me thy sheath. --this is thy sheath. There rust and let me die. I hope she doesn't give up the day job. Thank you. That's very good. Thank you. Next! Horace! Carter looks less than impressed. Well, I thought you were wonderful. - Thank you. - But he's the pro. CARTER HALE: Horace! Waitressing, no. Acting, no. Oh, I-- I didn't quite pee in my pants, but I owe you a beer anyway. Come on. Oh. Ah, ah! Sweeney's down! Hey, get over here, we need help! Somebody call the paramedics! Get a stretcher! Cheryl! What? Sweeney, he's having a heart attack or something! It's no joke! Come on! Pete, call the paramedics. Already did. Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. OK, he stopped breathing. Hang on, there's no pulse. Somebody help me. What do I do? Hands right here, and pump five times for breath I do. Hand me that. OK, thank you. Ready? He's breathing. He's breathing. Come on, guys! Hang on, Sweeney, here they come. He wasn't breathing and he had no pulse. We've now got him breathing. All right, I got a good pulse. I want the cardiac monitor. I'm going to start an IV right away. I'm going to need the portable oxygen tank. No problem. Oh, bring me the nitroglycerin. Could Is he going to be all right? He was a goner. Cheryl brought him back. His vitals are looking good. Advise the hospital we have a coronary coming. Hey. Hey. You did great. I hope he makes it. You sure you're OK? Yeah. Wow. There was no mistaking that. What? Something that mattered. I did something that mattered. Ooh. Sweeney? Don't quit on me, Sweeney. I've got a lot riding on you. OK? I don't think he's going to die. It's just not like him to die. No, he's a fighter. That's what got him here. That's what'll get him out. I'll tell him you came by. I know he'd like that. And, uh, thank you. Yeah. [doorbell ringing] - Come on in. - Hey, Pete. Hey. Wow, Cheryl, you look beautiful. Aw, Pete. Thank you. What's she doing with you? Yeah, you are beautiful. [clearing throat] Are you two, having a moment here, because I could leave? That would be great, Pete. Yeah. Come on, I'll show you the joys of fatherhood. Cheryl, CeeCee's in the kitchen. OK, I'll give her a hand. Don't cook. Whatever you do, do not cook. Oh, very funny. CeeCee, don't let her near the stove! Oh, supper's all ready! I don't need any help! I can let you stir, that's it. Oh, give me that. Hey, buddy. Come on, want to get a diaper change? Yeah, let's go. Oh, my god, he's gotten big. Yeah, he's getting big. Hey. CeeCee feeling OK? Yeah, she's holding up. It's been tough, though, especially with me pulling double shifts three days a week. Listen, Ben, um, I know things are tight around town right now for everybody. I don't got to tell you that. And I don't want to set myself apart from everybody else. But the truth is I just don't see how CeeCee and I are going to make it. Listen, Pete-- No, please, Ben, I gotta ask. I need a raise. Well, you're not going to get a raise, Pete. Nobody is. Yeah, well, you know, I just thought I'd ask. I owe it to CeeCee and the kids. I'm sorry. Look, I got to ask, if you really had to, what else would you do? What, you mean not work at the mill? Yeah. I don't know. You know, it's all I've ever done. You remember when dad used to say how steel gets in your blood, I think he was right. Hey, buddy, all done. There you go. You have to use a little imagination, all right? OK. I want to show you this. Come look right here. First of all, you clean up this whole area here for drinks. Come, follow me over here. That would be so beautiful. You have this porch that goes all the way around. I don't think we can get in here. It's probably locked. Ah, it's open. Look how charming this is. Look at the view people would have eating. I hate it when somebody calls my bluff. Well? So it would work fine. A counter over here, deli case, a few tables and chairs, near the lake, some guaranteed business from the hunters and fishermen. Well? Well what? Well, what do you think? I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready for this. Oh. What would happen if it doesn't work out? But it will work out. Easy for you to say. I got that feeling again, like right before I danced with you. Oh, well, maybe we'll just do a waltz next time. Hey. Well, hi. Were you going to leave without saying goodbye? No, I was just coming in to wake you up. Where you going? Going on a little business trip. OK. Mm-hmm, no big deal. Just something I gotta take care of, and I'll tell you all about when I get back. Fair enough. Will you feed my fish? I'd love to feed your fish. In the temple, in the town, in the field, you do me mischief. - I do. - Fie, Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal upon my sex. We cannot fight for love as men may do. We should be wooed, and we're not made to woo. I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell, to die upon the hand I love so well. O'er hill, o'er dale, o'er bush, o'er briar, o'er park, o'er pale, through a flood, through a fire, I do wander everywhere swifter than the moon's sphere. So good night unto you all. Give me your hands if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends. Cheryl. Hey. Oh, you were so wonderful. Oh, get out. Oh, you're too much. Let's go celebrate, get a beer. OK. Good idea. Oh, I should have used my crutches. My foot is killing me. Yeah, you weren't even limping. Hey, did you see Carter anywhere? Yeah, I did actually. Joyce, how well do you know Carter? Pretty well. How come your face is saying not well enough? Well, when a bad actress gets the lead role, don't you wonder? Allison? Yeah. Don't you wonder? You are really something, Cheryl Belson from Mississippi. You sure stir up a pot. Oh, no, Joyce, I didn't mean-- Dance up a storm, Joyce. Open up that restaurant, Joyce. Figure out that Shakespeare, get up on that stage, Joyce. Look at your boyfriend, see who he is, Joyce. Know what you want, know what you really want! God, you ask a lot out of people! Joyce, that's not-- ugh. Ben, it's been over a half a year now. It only took three months to make the call on Ithaca and New Bedford. Are you sure you're not letting a little hometown sentiment cloud your vision? Richard, I don't know if it's clouding my vision or giving it clarity. Look, I want to reinvest in Lincoln. Modernize. I think if we put enough money into this plant, it can turn a profit in 18 months. Why would I want to risk that kind of financial exposure? Because I know the people who work in Lincoln. They are literally giving their lives to keep this place open. I think we should match that effort with our own, give them a fighting chance. You close that place, that town will die. And the people will get severance, extended health, job placement programs. Ben, it's the numbers. No, it's not numbers. It's lives. It's people's lives, thousands of people. Look maybe it was a little unfair of me to send you back into your own home town with this mission, but Lincoln's failure was not my doing. Economics is second only to a force of nature. My decision to close that plant is only a reaction to something that has already happened on its own. [phone ringing] BEN CAMERON [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Hi, this is Ben. Leave a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Thank you. [beep] BEN CAMERON [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Ben, you understood going in that we probably were going to have to close the Lincoln plant. Now, accounting is telling us we have to shut down more abruptly than we thought. We're rerouting orders. As of now, Lincoln is a liability every moment it stays in operation. Don't disappoint me, Ben. Ben, you understood going in that we probably were going to have to close the Lincoln plant. Now, accounting is telling us we have to shut down more abruptly than we thought. [car door shutting] [house door being unlocked] Hey. Hey. This is a surprise RICHARD [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Ben, you understood going in that we probably were going to have to close the Lincoln plant. Now, accounting is telling us we have to shut down more-- I asked you to feed the fish, not to listen to my messages. I was not listening to your messages. I was cleaning your tank, and I happened to overhear that message. Who are you? - What? Are you the prodigal son that comes back to save the town-- What are you talking about? --and has a secret agenda held to the last second? You know, wait a second. I don't know how you could be party to this. All these people are your friends, not to mention your family. I know that! Don't you think I know that? You think this is easy for me? I close this place down, that's 1,000 people out of work. There are only 6,000 people in this town. Well, then, don't do it. Just quit. It won't do any good. Quit. And do what, express my sympathy by living in a ghost town? Quit! You don't know anything! You know, you come here, you think this is some charming little place! - Oh. Fine. How charming is it going to be when everyone in it is out of work, and on food stamps? How charming will it be when you have to hire a steel worker as your gardener? You know, why don't you stick your little telethons, and you won't get your hands dirty? If that's who you think I am, then I guess that's who I am. I got it. Be with you in a sec. Joyce. We got a meat loaf special tonight. $4.99 with super salad. Joyce. Beverage included. So what'll be? I don't have all night. I didn't mean to hurt you. God, I say that a lot. I don't know what you're talking about. OK. I need to make a call. Do you mind if I use your phone? Fran, it's me. And what was in that horrible little town that you can't find here? Nothing. Fran, I'm going to tell you something, and then let's not talk about it anymore, OK? I suppose. I caught Ryan with my stand-in. Caught? As in the biblical sense caught? That's right. Well, the guy's a pig anyway. You want me to dump him? No. Is there a guy in Hicksville? No. Then, what did you do for two weeks? Got a job at a steel mill. You're yanking my chain, right? No, I was a nurse. And when I tried out for a play, didn't get cast. We, uh, pushed back the Vanity Fair shoot, but the Albert Brooks film isn't going to happen for us. They went with Michelle Pfeiffer. Ah. I said they went with Michelle Pfeiffer. I heard you. Instead of you. I know. Don't worry about it. You know, Sydney, you might want to schedule another session with that shrink. And I probably made the biggest mistake of my life. Boy, this is going to be a doozie. What? Oh, never mind. [phone ringing] BEN CAMERON [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Hi, this is Ben. Leave a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Thank you. RICHARD [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Ben, I've left two messages already. They say you're not at the plant, and we need to talk. Ben, I repeat, we need to talk. No. Yeah, I understand-- - Sydney! - --Dick. That's what I thought. If you could put that information together for me, that would be great. I'll call you back. You have no idea what you put us through. We've been worried sick. Yeah, well, I just needed some time to think. Don't ever do a thing like that to us again. I want you to promise me that. I missed you so much. You missed me. You kidding? It was agony. Fran and I are hosting this party just to show you happy we are that you're back. I, uh-- I made some changes I thought you'd be happy with. We can look at that later. Right now, we have a wedding to plan, and this will play in decisions, and you know me, [inaudible]. Ryan, there's not going to be a wedding. What do you mean? This is not easy to say. I don't love you. Actually, that was pretty easy to say. Yeah. Sydney, our plans. Oh, this isn't about me and your stand-in, is it? Because that was nothing. Sydney, we have a wedding, OK? There are 1,000 guests. Ryan, I don't love you. What else can I say? You mean it? Yeah. OK, fine. How do you want the publicist to handle the spin on this thing? We'll tell them you dumped me. We will? Great! But I guess you won't be doing my script now? We'll see. Oh, yeah! What was I thinking? - How did he take it? - He was crushed. What a truly sensitive human being. Sydney! Snappers! OK, the trades are here. They just want to take a few pictures. Oh, this is nice. This is a nice background. Gentlemen, shoot the star. Well, uh, it's been about six months since I came back home to run this place. I jumped at the chance. I grew up here. You guys are my friends, my father's friends. I knew that, together, we'd put up a hell of a fight, because I know what you're made of. Well, I haven't been totally honest with you. You see, uh, this plant was slated to be closed down long before I ever got here. I know that's true, because it was my job to close it, not to run it-- to shut it down. I just thought that, uh, if we had a little more time, I could straighten things out, but that's not what they pay me for. You see, New York pays me a lot of money to shut down plants. You all did the best you could. It's not your fault. It's my fault. I thought I could save it, but I couldn't. And I'm sorry. Uh, Dick and I will be getting to the various departments about the shutdown. That's it. You did your best, Ben. They'll figure that out eventually. Sydney, darling, I'm so sorry about what happened. We sent out search parties. No, no, no, no, it's OK. I was out of line. - You're joking with me, right? - No. I'm really sorry. Listen, Monday, I have a very important meeting. Can we have a later call? Yes. We're in the studio. Make it a 5 o'clock call. I love you. I'll be on my toes for the Geppetto factor, Sydney. It was the Geppetto factor, I think. Yes. It doesn't look anything like her. How we supposed to know? I'm telling you, she stood right in my kitchen. Yeah, well, she kissed me. That was artificial respiration, you idiot. You're just jealous. Of what? She pulled a splinter out of my butt. Yeah, well, in Hollywood, I'll bet that's one thing she'd have used her stunt double for. Yeah, they would have used a stunt butt for Otis. Otis is a stump butt. What's that supposed to mean? Hey, Ben. Get my lawyers and accountants on the phone. I want a meeting this weekend. Lawyers, this weekend? Yeah, this weekend. Yeah, right. Dooley's. Joyce? Don't hang up on me. I won't hang up on you. How are you? Well, we're knee deep, to tell you the truth. The plant closed down today. Yeah, I know. Damn it, Cheryl-- Sydney, whatever-- why didn't you just tell me? I would have gotten you on the phone with My mother. It would have made her day. Because I liked Cheryl Belson better than Sydney Clarke, OK? Well, we like them both. Who cares if you're famous? Well, for starters, the 600 people in my living room. Is Matt Damon there? As a matter of fact, yes. Oh! Why didn't you just tell me? I could have called my sister. She's a Sydney Clarke freak. OK. OK, so I'm the last one to know. Big deal. You OK? I think I knew about Carter all along. I just-- I just didn't want to believe it. We never do. Well, it, uh, made me do a lot of thinking. About what? About want. No, sorry. Want! Is that better? That a girl. I've been doing a lot of thinking myself. About Ben? Yeah. I messed up, Joyce. Well, yeah, you know, Ben kept the plant going a while after the death sentence. Have you seen him? Yeah, I'm looking at him right now. Well, I've got to tell you, he looks like hell. Sydney, Fran says you have a houseful of guys. She'd like you to come right away. Joyce, I've got to go, but I'll call you back real soon, OK? OK. Bye. Bye. Ben, you ever wonder why people sit in an audience? Well, I'll tell you why. Because a character's got a big want, right? You know, like you and me? So you gotta decide what it is you want, and how much. And that's all I got to say. OK? OK. Did I make any sense at all? Yeah. Good. Cut! Sydney, where are you going? Aren't you supposed to be shutting down the mill? I quit. Big risk. It's worth it. I'll do anything for what I want. What do you want, Ben? I want my fish to get better. I want you. I want you, too. Sydney, we have a movie to make. Do you mind? If you quit again-- Can't quit, Harry. I need the money. I bought a steel mill. You what? Me, and about 20 other people. I'm looking for the right guy to run it. Cut! Never thought I'd see that. We're back! Bump-ba-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da. Rah! Rah! It's officially yours. Da-da-dum! Yum-bum-bum! ALL: Da! Whoo! Yes! Look after the old homestead, buddy. [music playing] I love my new house! I love New England! Oh, I hate my cell phone. Hello? FRAN [ON PHONE]: Syd, it's me. It's heating up. I've sent you a script. I want you to read it over the weekend. It's a comedy. It's a comedy. That's great. I'll read it right away. And Fran, after today, I won't have a cell phone anymore. ALL: What? Now, where were we? Remind me. [music playing]
