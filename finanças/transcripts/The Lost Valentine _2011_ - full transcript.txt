You said that, I didn't. Yeah. I hate this. Leaving you. Especially now, knowingI won't be here for you. At least you won't haveto see me get fat. I was lookingforward to that. I sure never dreamedthis is how we would spend our first anniversary. First boardingcall for Southern Pacific train number 37, service to Los Angeleson track 12. Southern Pacific train number37, service to Los Angeles. That's us. Now, I want youto write me every day. I want to know everything. How you feel.What you had for breakfast. Whether I kept it down. Yes. Oh, no, no, no. Caroline, listen, we'll get through this. Promise you'll come back. I'll come back,I'll come back, I promise. Last call forSouthern Pacific 37. It's all right. It's okay.

There you are, Mrs. Thomas.How you doing today? Oh, Mr. Williams. Sit... Sit down. Don't you look wonderful. Well, if I do, thatmakes two of us. I was just saying to myself, it's about time for that pretty Caroline Thomasto show up. And there you are, right on schedule. Wouldn't want to be late. No, I--I don't suppose you would. 25 years I've been working here, and you haven't been late once. Nor in the 40 years before that. I don't know ifI ever told you this, but back whenI was still teaching, I always took Valentine's Dayoff to come here. Can I get you anything? Uh, water? Anything? No, no, I... thank you. I'll just sit here. I have everything I need. Well, take care. MAN: This is your final boarding callfor train 20... WOMAN: And we're out. I've got some new storiesfor us to discuss. Great. Did you getthat school janitor who used his savingsto start a scholarship fund? Uh, Mr. Figueroa does notwant to be interviewed. But Senator Irving, on the other hand-- being up for reelectionthis year-- was very eager to sharehis thoughts and memories. His biography and coverage, his book, more coverage, articles written by him, articles written about him and this is heavy on hisvet rehab initiative. You know, it's notveryAmerican Diary. Exactly. And if you getthe right edge, you get a shotatWorld Profile. And I'm going with youas your producing partner. And we will not bestuck in the land of soft and sappy anymore. Maybe you need a drinkof water, Julie. I'll get right on that. You feeling stuck, Susan? Not me. I'm good. So Julie was justpitching Senator Irving. She said that he'd loveto be interviewed and he's up for reelection.Human interest. Senators are human--sometimes interesting. We're notWorld Profile. We'reAmerican Diary. And this is what worksforAmerican Diary. It's 1944. A young bride goesto Union Stationon Valentine's Day-- her anniversary, no less-- to send her young Navy pilothusband off to war. He swears he'll come back, she swears she'll wait. He goes missing in action. But 65 years later, she's still living upto her end of the bargain, by going down to the stationevery Valentine's Day including this past February, to wait for his train. And? That's it. Well, what elsehas she done? I mean, has she starteda support group forNavy wives, what? She goes downto the station. She waits. It's a love story. You know what itreminds me of? That Japanese dog story. The one with the Akita who goeslooking for his master at the train station ten years after he dies... Susan. No, it'll be a real tearjerker. Dogs and old ladies who wait at train stations for their deceasedloved ones? Come on. Lucas Thomas... Susan Allison. Hi. I'm the grandson of the old ladywho waits at the train stationfor her deceased loved one. Oh... Lucas and my nephew Bobby are old college buddies. You know, when Bobby toldmy wife that story, she was desperate to get meto sit you down, Lucas, and figure out how toget your grandmotheronAmerican Diary. I can see why the piece would work for your show, but I'm just not sure that mygrandmother's the type of person to pursue something like this. Thanks for lunch, Craig. You're very welcome. Nice meeting you. Very smooth, Susan. I'll get the story. Hello. I'm Susan Allison, fromAmerican Diaryon GNTV. Hello. I'm sorry, dear, but I'mnot familiar with your program. Are you Caroline Thomas? Yes, I am. Great. Well, we wouldlove to interview you for our television show. Me? I think you havethe wrong person. Oh, no. I'm pretty surethat it's you. Oh, well, that's nice, but... No, thank you. And, uh, if you'll excuse me, I have a kettle boiling. Okay, well... Hi. Did I say that I wasfromAmerican Diary? Yes, you mentioned that. But I have no interestin television, and as you can hear,I'm a bit busy. I know Lucas. You're a friend of Lucas? Well, why didn't yousay that? Come on in. Make yourself at home.Would you like some tea? Thank you. What did you say yourname was again, dear? Um, Susan.Allison. Ah... LUCAS: Hello? Hello, Lucas? It's Grandma. You didn't tell me you hada friend coming by today. Are you coming, too? What friend? Uh, Susan Allison? Something about an interview. She's there at the house? Yes, we're having tea. I'll be right over, Grandma. Okay, dear.We'll see you soon. Grandma. CAROLINE: Hello, dear. Hey, Grandma. Ooh, oh, hey! Lucas, hi! Hello! How are you? I'm fine. I'm justa little surprised to see my "friend" here. You know, I didn't actuallysay that you were my friend. I just said that I knew you.Hmm. Wow. This rosebushis beautiful. Yeah, that bushis dead. It is not dead. And it's very special to me. My husband and I planted ita long time ago. And when was that? Uh, Grandma, could you justexcuse us for a moment? Uh, well, certainly, dear. Yeah.I'll, uh, I'll get ussome iced tea. Oh.Sounds great. There we are.Thank you. What are youdoing here? I thought you had no interestin my grandmother. You know, I think that I may have given youthe wrong impression. Really? But... I'm here now, so... Five minutes. Please. We think that it would makethe most beautiful story. One that would reallyimpact people's lives, and help themto believe in love. Kind of like thatJapanese dog story. Japanese dog story? Um... Your story reminds peoplewhat matters most. What I don't understand is... why me? There were so many womenwho went through Oh, but it is. Oh, really? Please, tell us, whatmakes her story so... different? Well, um... You know, you, you kept the love alive. I'm sorry, dear. I just don'tthink this is for me. Lots of womenkept the love alive. I just kept goingto the station. JULIE: That is so sad. To have your whole life revolvearound going to a train station, waiting for someonewho's never coming back. Julie, it's nother whole life. It is one day a year. Aw. You spend that much timeevery weekend waiting for me to come back from golf. Susan spends that much time every few weeks going to theairport to wait for Andrew. The difference being, I get off the plane. SUSAN: Uh, usually. One time. One timeI didn't make my flight. Well, um... I'm here now. Cooking for you, serving you. Oh, I knew it. The candles and the flowers. You're buttering me up forsomething. Okay, let me guess. You have accepted an eight-monthassignment in Uzbekistan. A lifetime assignment. That's an engagement ring. That's, uh, what I saidthe minute I saw it. I said, "Now, that'san engagement ring!" And your answer is...? You never asked the question. I never askedthe question? What do you think I was sayingwhen I gave you the ring, uh, "Want to go see a movie?" The appropriate words wouldhave been, "Will you marry me?" And maybe you could havedone it in private. I wanted to share the momentwith our friends, our... our very good friendswho probably haven'tstopped whispering "Poor Andrew" out there.Okay, so what didyou want me to do? Just say "yes" for their benefitand then back out later on? You're saying no? No, I... I don't know. I thought we'd talked aboutgetting married one day.Yeah! We did, as in"If we ever..."Should we just go? My car keys and jacketare in there. We're, we're good together, we get along. How do you even knowif we get along, Andrew? You're always in Guatemala, or Rwanda, or the backside of Egypt.It's what I do! I go to places, and I take pictures. You want me tochange what I do? No. You want to break up? Andrew, there isa huge difference between saying no to amarriage proposal immediately than breaking up. I'll, uh, call you.Or you'll call me. Whatever, I... Keep the ring, think about it, and when I getback from Fiji... Fiji, right. What? Nothing. By the time you get back, you will have forgiven me for embarrassing youin front of our friends, and I will notfeel weird anymore that you put me on the spot, and everything will just... go back to normal. Promise me you'llthink about it? About us. I will, I promise. Hey, good night, you guys. Oh, okay.Night, buddy. Good night, Andrew. That must've been awfulfor you guys, I'm so sorry. There's just a lotto think about. Yeah, what is thereto think about? You guys have knowneach other for years. He's a great guy. He's an incredible guy. Right. So, what moredo you want? I don't know. Okay. Okay. Um... why don't you tell mewhat's really going on? If you're going to spendyour life with somebody, don't you wantto feel excited? Thrilled, even? I mean, isn't theresupposed to be... : magic? Look, I just... I want you to remember that good guys arereally hard to come by. Remember that whenI'm out golfing. Got it. I'm crossing my fingersfor you two. Thank you. You're welcome. Good night. I just... oh. I don't want you toregret this decision somewhere down theroad, that's it. Okay? Okay. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Hello? Ooh. Hello? JULIE: Hi. Why aren't youin the editing room? 'Cause I'm meetingCaroline Thomas again. Until I get that interview, she's my new best friend. Right. But, uh, who is goingto edit your segment? We are, we're already behind. Um, you are. Because you're brilliant, okay? So just cover for me? Craig wants this done, like, now. Listen, I gotta go. Hey, there. You don't believe incalling ahead, do you? Phones can be hung up. What happens when someonesays "no" to you? Uh, never really happens. Oh, you should get out more. Where is she? Oh, she's probably gettingready to go and didn't hear you. Go? She's got a standingdate on Saturdays. Maybe she'll take you along. On a date? She's got a real soft spotfor military men. Uh, I'll just... I'll wait here. CAROLINE: Here's my fisherman. Oh and, Dave, I knowyou like sports, I know that. That's a new one.Okay. Thank you. Hi. Hello. Would you likea magazine? "Vilify the New York Yankees "all you want, but quite simply, the Yankees are greatfor baseball." Says who? Oh, come on. Well, that's whatit says, anyway. "It is precisely their statusas the most hatedIsn't it painful? Franchise in sports history... "Seeing all thesemen who've returned? Now we're talking."This year, yet again, She gets indignant when people get it wrong aboutwho's really in pain here."they lead the league in both spending and revenue." I don't hate them. I just wish they wouldn't beatthe teams I like better. SUSAN: So, you think she's going to let me do the story? Don't know. Well, you do havesome influence on her. Well, I won't use it. Not even if I can convinceyou it's a good thing? It's not my decision to make. I'll supportwhatever she decides. Fair enough. You know, I think it'ssweet that you support her. We support each other. After she lost my grandfather, her whole life wastaking care of others. My father, her students, me, these men. She was 20 years old. I want to take careof her now. You're a very unusual guy. I don't think so. What, you don't help and supportyour family? Um, basically my family'sall in Boston. We're not close, really. My... my dad dieda few years ago, and my mom and I don't really--we don't see each other, so... I'm rambling. And I'm sorryabout that. Is your lowerback bothering you? No, it's fine. Maybe you should trystretching out your hips. You might findyour flexors are tight. And... you weren't rambling. We were talking. Yeah, I think your grandmother'sprobably done now, so... So why do you do this? Honestly? At first I-- I was hoping I'd find my Neil. There were so manywounded men. And I kept telling myselfanything's possible. And then, it changed for you? Yeah, I... I guess it did. It made me feel goodto, you know, to help. Even now. I'm from a generation who honors service. To our country, to each other. Maybe that sounds old-fashionedto a lot of people. I don't know about that. Doesn't sound old-fashionedto me. But it does sound like a Thomas family trait. I like this one. Well, I hate to leavegood company, but I've got somework to catch up on. Oh, that's all right, Lucas. And thank you for today. No problem, Grandma. Same time next week. It was good to seeyou again, Susan. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Me, too. Oh, here. Thank you. So what does... what does Lucas do? You don't know? He's a physical therapist. He's about to be published. Really? He wrote an exercise book. So, this has been lovely. What's next? Next? Uh, do you bring inthe cameras, or...? You're going to letme do the story! Oh, thank you! Sorry. Okay, um... Wow. Ultimately, we would justlike to get you on tape telling your sideof the story in your own words, but in the meantime... I don't much believein meantime. Life happens in real time. How soon do you want to start? CAROLINE: I hope it's okay if we dothe interview like this. I... I'll feel morenatural if I'm busy. Natural is perfect. Who could wantmore than natural? Okay, are you ready to start? Just in my own words? However you want to tell it. All right, uh... I guess we have to startat the beginning. Although with Neil and me it's hard to knowwhere it all began. Uh... I'd known him forever--since grade school. About a year before graduation, his family moved away, and we lost touch. I didn't seen him againtill '43. By then, of course, the war was on. We planted victory gardens, collected scrap metal and rubber for recycling. Everywhere you looked, there was a reminder. Everyone seemed to have something to do behind the scenes for the war effort. That's because we all had someone we loved "over there." Folks put stars in their windows to show how many family members they had overseas. Everyone was united, bound together in a sense of patriotism. I was doing my part by working for the USO. Caroline? Caroline Jensen? Neil. I-I-I can't believe this. I... Jenny, Jenny, look who's here. You remembermy sister? Yes, yeah. JENNY: Neil Thomas. Well, you look better thana man has a right to. You do, too.

I wrote him every day. Sometimes twice. Take it easy. Okay. Oh. Mr. Myers! Hi. Looks like this letter'sfrom someone with the same last nameas yours. Thanks. NEIL: Dearest Caroline, I miss you. Here's a present for my Navy wife and a plane I whittled for our little one. We shipped out of San Francisco and made it to Pearl Harbor in seven days. Because we're replacements, we're awaiting assignments to a carrier. The fighting right now is in the Marianas and Caroline Islands, east of the Philippines. The Marines are taking one island at a time, while the Navy is claiming the air and sea. As for me, I... I think about you every minute. I keep your Valentine in my pocket, next to my heart, to remind myself that one day this will all be behind us and we'll be together again.

Somewhere around Lubbock, Texas. Ooh, that's Lucas. I got to go. Lucas? Hey. LUCAS: Hey. How's our girl? She's asleep right now. She's tougher than she looks. Sweetie. Thank you. And my, uh, my folksare in from New York, so that'll be a nice surprisefor her when she wakes up. How's D.C.? Uh, mission accomplished, actually. I'm changing my flightand heading to Texas. Texas? Do you know what was doneto find your grandfather after he was declared missing? Um, everything that couldbe done, I'm pretty sure. I know that my grandmotherstayed after the Navy for years. And did you know that there weretwo American survivors on the last missionthat your grandfather flew? Just one. A guy named Roberts. He's not a survivoranymore, though. He, uh, he died shortly afterhe came back stateside. Actually, there was another one. Guy by the name ofJeff Billings. The Navy had a reportthat he'd been rescued. Unfortunately, there wasa little paperwork snafu, and he was officially classifiedas killed in the line of duty, until seven years ago, when heactually died of natural causes. Then the paperwork gotstraightened out. And I'm guessingthat your grandmother had stopped looking by then. Not to mention, it was probablya little late for him to tell us anythingreally useful. Well, dead men talkall the time, Lucas. Hi. Mr. And Mrs.Billings? I'm Susan Allison. I spoke with you last nightfrom D.C. I'm Anne. Hi. And this is Glenn. How do you do, ma'am? You're thetelevision lady? Yeah, that's me. The television lady. Can I get yousomething to drink? SUSAN:I'm fine, really. Thank you for agreeingto speak to me. Don't know how muchwe can help you, ma'am. Um, I grew up listeningto all my daddy's war stories, and I do remember him talkingabout the lieutenant-- that's who saved his life-- but he never did knowwhat became of him. Wait a minute. Lieutenant Thomas savedyour father's life? Yes, ma'am. They got shot downover Manila Bay, and they was bothhit pretty bad. They parachuted to the ground, hid out in the jungle on the Bataan Peninsulauntil a local was able to get my daddy backto the Americans. Well, if they were ableto help your father, then how comeLieutenant Thomas...? They had this little cart. It was only big enoughto hide one man, and the lieutenantrefused to go. He said my daddy was way worse than he was, and they could just send somebody back after him. It's all in the letter. What letter? It was the first letter my daddy wrote back homeafter he got rescued. Anyway, that... that was the last timemy daddy saw the lieutenant. Tried to look him up after thewar, but all he could find out was that he'd been listedas missing in action. So Lieutenant Thomasjust stayed there in the jungle? Well, they'dmet some men. Tribesmen and a coupleof rebel fighters. At least he wasn't alone. Here you go, honey. My daddy wrote it all down. And I think my mama kept it inthe Bible, just to remind herself thateverything's in God's hands. I think mydaddy would want the lieutenant's wifeto have that, ma'am. MAN: Here we go. Home at last, huh? Hey, you! Hey. I heard the hospitallet you go 'cause you were too muchfor them to handle. How are you? Oh, glad to see you, that's how I am. Welcome back.Soon as you put himdown, we can talk. Oh. Let me introduce youto my parents. This ismy mother Maggie. Hi.That's my father Neil, Jr.This is Susan. Hi, nice tomeet you.Hi. I feel as ifwe already know you just from watching your show. Oh, I'm gladyou enjoy it. I have a surprise for you. Neil, your father savedthis man's life. He had a chanceto be rescued, and he put the man's life first. SUSAN: Jeff Billings never knewwhat became of your husband, but in that letter, he mentions a tribesman, Morang. I'm gonnacheck it out. Do you think it's possibleyou could find him? Somebody somewhere knowswhat happened in that jungle. And I'm gonna find out. I promise. You promised? It was a bitoptimistic, I admit, but I still thinkI can do it. And with your own workbeing so totally irrelevant. Um, this is my work. You're the one whoput me on the story. And I took you off.Remember that part? Yeah, but I thinkif you and I... No. Fine. Then you know what,I'll see you in a week. It's been three yearssince I've had a vacation, and I'm feelinga bit run down. Are you serious? Yep. Job might not be herewhen you get back. Okay. If that's how you feel. Can you reason with her? I never side with Craig, butall you have is a man's name. No. Actually, I have a place. Bataan Peninsula. Yeah, but you don'tknow he's from there. Morang was a native. The-The letter saysthat he was a native. So? I'm a nativeof New Jersey. This is notNew Jersey. Look, I am not gonnalet Caroline Thomas die without the answersthat she has been looking for. Because you're fallingfor her grandson. Wow. You know what, I teetered on the brink, but Caroline--I care about her. Susan, whathappened? What happened?! Nothing. Almost nothing. What about Andrew? I am working on it, okay? And I'm gonnaback away from Lucas. Okay, because you seem toreally like this guy... Look, can we just talk aboutsomething else, okay? I'm backing away from Lucas. Look at me. Backing. No Lucas. Got it. Hey. Hey. Brought yousomething. This will keep youflexible, healthy and hopefully... happy. Wow. It does all that? Well, it will, soon as Iteach you how to use it. Well, I-I can't accept it. Look, I know how busyyou are with work, and now you're runningaround for my grandmother. I just, I thought, when does she have time to take careof herself? I run. It also comeswith flowers. Just a friendlyreminder to take a moment, stop, lean forward, with your spineproperly aligned and... smell the roses. I love roses. I can't. Why not? It's just a gift. For all you've done. I think maybe we shouldjust keep this friendly. Friendly. Okay. Friendly, it is. I like you. But I am involvedwith someone else. And I... ...need to decide how Ifeel about him-him first. Mm-hmm. You had to go and say that, didn't you? Now I just like you more. SUSAN: Is that as exact as you can get? Just "north of Orion Bataan"? Okay, well, what aboutthe map coordinates? Did the pilot notethe coordinates? Uh-huh. Didn't I tell you? He's becoming a superstararound here. You're right, Mom. Look at allthis stuff. Wow! Oh, I couldn't be more proud. I don't know. It's a littleembarrassing, if you ask me. Why? I just hope that we geta big enough crowd. I mean, who's gonna want a signed copy ofan exercise book? You have helpedso many people. They want to meet you. MAGGIE: And we'll be here. Why not ask Susan? Oh, she's cute. Okay, you guys, stop, all right? She's got a boyfriend. It's not gonna happen. Oh, I'm sorry. It looked like therewas something there. No, there'snothing there. Oh, I agree with Grandma. She looked interestedto me. Well, she mentionedsome other guy acouple times now. I got the picture. Well, don't be soquick to dismiss it. You like her, I can tell. Maybe this person she talksabout isn't the one. Hey! Hey. What are you doing here?! I got back a day early. Well, I wish that youwould have called me, 'cause I could'vecome and picked you up. Well, if you want,I'll let you driveme back tomorrow. So, you're leaving againtomorrow? No. No! No, no, no, no! Let me, let me start over.I am sorry. I've been on a planefor 12 hours, and I need a hug. Okay. Wow. Why all the research? Is that Bataan? What's going on? Remember the storythat I told you I was doing about the lady whose husband she lost inWorld War II? Yeah.Well, I'm tryingto help her find him. After 60 years? Yeah, except now I knowwhere he was and the name of the manwho saw him last. Morang... Mm-hmm. Do you still haveany contacts in the Philippines thatmight be able to help? Uh, yeah, I still have a few contacts there. I haven't spoken to themin a while, though. You know, it'sthe love of her life, and she still has no idea what happened to him. Well, hey, that's allyou had to say. I'll do anything for love. I don't want to hurt you. Right. No, of course not. I'm sorry, Andrew. We're just not ready. Yeah. I was hoping that maybe, uh... But I had a feeling. We're just not therefor each other. And that's not... that'snot your fault, andit's not my fault. It just... it is what it is. Are you seeing somebody? No. Why-Why would you...? No, I'm... I'm... not. Um... Can you e-mail me everything you've found onyour missing soldier? Yeah. But... what about us? Shouldn't we talk about that? Not right now. I, uh...

It's kind ofa long shot.Thank you... for being so incredibly decent. Well, you have to knowwhat you stand for, don't you? And beyond that, it's courage of conviction. And in this case... Hello.
