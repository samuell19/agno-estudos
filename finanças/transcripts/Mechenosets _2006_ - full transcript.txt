Search for him. - Do you know this area? - Yes. - Good. The dogs failed to take scent. They're useless here. - You and your men must go and comb the forest. - Okay. A logging truck got crashed on the side-road... - A logging truck? - There's word it was sliced in two. Police... police... - When the fuck are you gonna come? - We're here, pal. What's wrong? Police... Just look at it! It's really sliced in two. Logs rolled down all over the road. This awful sound... He got this fucking thing in his hand. Here. My head is buzzing... I never give a ride to anyone. Watch out... It can blow up. Nikolai... Let's go. Move it... move it. We better get out of here. Was he alone? THE SWORD BEARER They all got scared of me. No. They got scared of the mad guy. They got scared of me, mom. No. Sleep. Auntie Lida, do you remember me? I'm Sasha. I used to live here. - Yes, I remember you. - Is mother not home now? - No. She is out. - Don't tell her, that I dropped by. Okay? - Okay? I'll do it myself. It's Seryozha. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? Hugging? - Yes, we are. What are you doing? He's my friend. - Your friend? - Yes! - Well, friend? Stop it! Enough! Let's go. - Come on... - What? I can have friends, can't I? Bye. What's wrong? My God... Poor guy. - How is he? Hi... - Have you brought a photo? Ah-huh. - Who? - Here. Bring him some chicken broth. Warm food will do him good. - Is it him, Klim? - Yes, this is him. - Poor guy. Klim, find him. You must find him before cops do. - He disfigured my sonny so bad. - I'll find him, Bella. - So you say you haven't seen or heard of your son for long. - No, I haven't. - Do you know where his father lives? - No, I don't. - If you get any info about him, call us. Okay? - Got anything? - Nothing, she doesn't know anything. Let's go. - Want a dagger? - Show it to me. - Real? - Sure. - Get it out. - I can't. - Let's go to a quiet place. - Okay. This way. - Bastard! I'll pour out your vodka! - Put it back, I say. - Get away from me! - Sit, bitch! And you're here, too, bastard. You eat and drink at my expense! Don't you touch my son! Kolya! What have you done?! Klim, I tracked him down. Come. Mom, and where's my biological father? He's constantly skipping classes, picking up fights, - and his recent act is really bad - he cut his friends' things. - I can't believe it. I'm talking about expelling your son from school. But firstly you're to compensate for the damaged stuff. - I understand. But why this rush? - I'm saying it again... - I'll pay for it, but you know... Now I'll have to work for some months to pay for the things you damaged. You got cold hands again? Why you got cold hands again?! Tell me?! Valya? Valya? Not enough sugar... Valya, where are you? Where are you running, eh?! - To town. - Get in. Bella! Right, he's here. No, I won't come. Too risky to travel with a guy who's wanted by the police. I'm waiting for you. Sucker. Let's take him over there. Why didn't he hurt you, eh? Apartment 4, 12 Sovetskaya Street... Kaliningrad Region. Him? - Wrong, wrong... - And this one? - It's him! How could he escape? What do thugs respect you for? You are worthless. You let a small boy escape... Shit... Klim, Klim! - Tell me how he could get away from you? - Don't yell at me! - What?! Give me some water. - You're sitting in my way. - Want to get to the radiator? - I live here. - I live here. What's your name? - So beautiful. - Uh-huh. - What? - Nothing. Hello? I don't get it. What does this mean? I keep on calling you and you... What a bitch! A fucking bitch! - Okay... - Get out of here! Stay here, stay here for a while! Let's go. Good car. Creep! Hello, hello, Pasha! Pasha! - Finally! - Are you alone? - Right, alone! - No use! Cut it! - I'll do it this way! Well done, let's go! - I want to drink... - You want to drink? Wait. Well, darling, did you miss me? - Not really. - And I did miss you. Show me how he kissed you. Show it to me, come on! Show to me, how he kissed you, come on! Bitch... Show to me, how he kissed you, Go away! I want to go home... Okay, two cellphones... What else do we have here? I know the girl. She came here with guy, who was stabbed. - What else? - A wallet. - As for the guy I haven't seen him before. But I've already said all to your men. Hello, hello, have I reached the police? I got here... ...in my apartment... ...a murderer... His name? Why are you standing there? Why are you standing? Let's go there. Police, open up! Open up! Again... - What? - Why are you smiling? What's your name? - Katya. - Katya? And I'm Sasha. You're so extraordinary. They got a priest driving the car. He complained that he was tired like shit. There's a motel down the road, probably, you'll check it? They couldn't go too far. Yes? Yes, Bella. No. No, I'd like to check one more motel. - Stop yelling at me! - Sorry. Bitch, bitch! What a bitch! - Did I wake you up? - Back in the car I already felt you wanted to talk to me. No, in the car I didn't. I've never confessed to a priest. One person... ...You know... ...She... She became very dear to me. She trusts me, but she can't be with me. No way... I can't... - Sorry. - That's all right. You said enough. Everything will be fine. Can we go together as far as the church? And then each will go their own way? God save you. What happened? Get the fire extinguisher from the trunk. Is there anyone alive? Thank you. - This one? - Thank you, Lyosha. - Okay, I'm off. - Thank you. Okay. Go. - A speaking toy? - Sorry, it's for my daughter. Today's her birthday. Okay, let's proceed. ...I'm asking you again... ...With what weapon you committed this murder by the restaurant? I grabbed something. But I don't remember what. - What's with Katya? - Katya's all right. Actually, you're very lucky. Very few survive such crashes. - So you don't remember. - I don't. But not with this, right? You're gonna have company. Beat the hell out of him. But don't beat him up to death. Got it? Face to the wall. Get into the cell. We've been waiting for you long. Who didn't want to have you around, sonny? Did you hear? A new bride was delivered to Boar. Yes, I heard it. Your turn... It doesn't look like a wedding night to me. Come on, open it! Quick! I'm absolutely fine! I had no time to figure out what's happening. They're kind of weird guys. Got into a fight, started yelling. Stabbing one another. I got so scared. With what did they start stabbing one another? As I said I got so scared... I hid under the bunk, turned to the wall. They're kind of weird guys. Got into a fight. Started yelling. Stabbing one another. I got so scared, hid under the bunk, closed my eyes. I turned to the wall. And saw nothing. Cut it. Stop playing the fool. What happened in the cell? They got into a fight. Started stabbing one another. Yelling. I hid under the bunk, turned to the wall. I got so much scared. I saw nothing. They are all total psychos. That's it. To the cell. Write that you refuse to give testimony. Where's Katya? With what did you stab your cell-mates? I'll tell you all. Where's Katya? Katya is in a mental institution. It's you who got her there. You. It's neither me, nor him. It's you! With what did you stab your cell-mates? Huh? With this. Take him away. You haven't had your breakfast again, sweetie, eh? What shots are you giving me? These are just mosquito bites... Katya! - Why did you come? - Klim! He's escaped! Killed all guards. - We're doing all we can. He just vanished in the air. - What do you mean "vanished"? Where? Come on, get out of there... Apply iodine to the wound. It'll heal soon. Sasha! Sasha... Sasha... He'll come. I'm sure he'll come. He'll come to get his girlfriend out of here. Why the hell should he come? He'll hide away in some abandoned village. And that's it. Or will flee to China. Or will do face-lifting. It's fashionable now. I read one partisan hid in the basement throughout the whole war. The war is over already, but he keeps hiding there, he hides on, and on, and on... - he hides on, and on, and on... - Give me the cellphone! I visited her there. She's sick. They're giving her her shots of tranquilizers. And she's more secure there than together with you. You got lost. Turn to our Lord. He'll forgive you. Excuse me... - This is for you. - Is it God calling me? I have no time. I'm too busy, you know! I'm sorry... I guess, it's too late for me to turn to God. - So? - He has no time, he's too busy, you know... - Must I send units to the church? - Do it! - Seryozha, with the radio, come here, quick! - He'll come here. Hello, hello? Daddy, is this you? Klim, my sonny is still in the hospital, and you're doing absolutely nothing. - Why, Klim? - It'll work out fine, Bella. Where are you going? To the lady's room. It'll work out fine, Bella. Bella... Hold it! - Bring her here! - My daughter's toy. Where's my daughter? Look, don't aggravate it! No negotiations. You're to let us go. You'll know about your daughter later. - Lyosha... - Two of you go with me! Where are you taking me? If you kill me, Sasha will come and cut you to pieces. Sasha! Will you take me out of here? What shall we do now? - Lyosha, go to my place, quick. - Right. Follow me. What are you doing?! Are you nuts? - Where's Anya? - Over there. - And what's with Kolya? - He's alright. - And what about the door? - Hello? Nick, he was bluffing. Anya is home. - Are they all home? Why don't they answer the phone then? The line is cut off with a kind of blade. Okay, I'm on my way already. Jesus... Shoot to kill. All units. You're permitted to shoot to kill. I repeat - shoot to kill! So you wanted to cheat me? - Are they again chasing us? - Right. A bit. - There were so many mosquitoes there. - I know. Get down! What? What's wrong, sweetheart? Katya! Katya? Katya, what's wrong with you? Katya? In this case we say the criminal is exceptionally dangerous. - Okay. - Don't risk your men's lives and the stuff. You have already arrested him once! That's enough. - Where was the logging truck? - Here, by the hill. - You must look for him in this area. - Okay. I'll follow his tracks, and you follow me in the chopper. Go! - Nikolai, take me with you, please! - No, wait here. Like in a fairy-tale. - I had I dream we were sailing... - We were sailing... - We are to go now, right? - Yes. One of them is injured. They won't go too far. Let's get out of here! Bring her down! Katya! Katya, don't fear anything! You're just freezing. I know. You just need to get some rest. Katya, Katya, darling.
