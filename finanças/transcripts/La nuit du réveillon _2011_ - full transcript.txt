CHRISTMAS EVE Stop! Chicken soup... Stop it, Julien! Why don't you open the door? - Mum said we shouldn't. - No, she didn't. Let's play it again. Hello. Can I come in? Your mum is expecting me. I'll go and get my father. If you do that, it will spoil the surprise your mum has organised. You don't want to upset her, do you, Jeanne? Father Christmas! - Hello, children. - Hello, Father Christmas. Don't touch! Otherwise... You won't get any presents. - Do you understand? - Yes. Father Christmas. You're very quiet, Jeanne. My mother will be back soon. She'll be so pleased to see me. - Mummy! - Have you all been good? - He's here. - Who is, - darling? - Father Christmas. - He's old. - No, he's normal. - Father Christmas won't be here - until tonight. -But he's here now. Father Christmas is always old. Come and see him. - Gently! - There's Father Christmas. He looks like an old grandpa. We meet at last, Mrs Boutonnier. I thought for a moment you'd forgotten our appointment. - I... - Don't worry. I've thought of everything. - Did you bring what we asked for? - Did you remember everything? Your children are charming. If you tell them you asked me to come over for Christmas Eve, to be the surprise guest, that might reassure them. They have such vivid imaginations they might think I'm taking you hostage. What do you think? Patricia? - I'll get Dad. - You stay right there. Your inertia is starting to cause problems. You must do as he says, children. Dad will be pleased, but it's a surprise. - Dad hates surprises. - Not this one. He will love this one. My dear Mrs Boutonnier, it's time you and I had a chat in the kitchen to finalise the arrangements for this evening. What do we do? You can carry on watching cartoons. Julien! Keep an eye on them, Jeanne. Mrs Boutonnier? Don't be so nervous. Relax. From now on you will do as I say. You don't want your children to worry, do you? Well? Then be a good girl. You're going to make a very pretty suicide bomber. Put this round your thigh. As far as I know, you not into chemistry, so listen carefully. One false move, one bump and you explode. Bits of Patricia all over the walls. Your children would be traumatised. Perfect. Now, let's go and say hello to your husband. Are you OK? I'm fine. We're going to see Daddy. Us, too. Dad-dy! Dad-dy! Shut up! Otherwise, you won't be getting... this. That's for you, too, Jeanne. Wake him up. Pierre. Wake up. - Feeling rested, Mr Boutonnier? - What the hell...? Don't play any dirty tricks, such as activating the alarm linked to the police station. It would be most unpleasant for your wife. - I've got a bomb. - A bomb? You're crazy. What...? Don't you dare call Father Christmas crazy. - Have you got that? - He's got it. - Stop it. - I want to hear him say it. Say it! - I've got it. - There, that's better. High technology, to be handled with care. Your wife got the message. Around your waist. And to discourage any thoughts of heroism, I'm going to ask you to watch this short film. Oh, God! He's the last person who can help you tonight. But don't worry. Tomorrow morning you'll be free, once you, Mr Boutonnier, have accompanied me to the bank and opened the safes for me for the biggest collection of the year. I love the festive period. I hope you are a morning person. I want to be there at six sharp. The security guards patrol at half past seven. Yes. In precisely eleven hours. If we haven't left the bank by then, you'll explode, you and Mrs Boutonnier. The bombs are synchronised. If one goes off, the other one does, too. Is that clear enough for you? Don't look so miserable. It's Christmas Eve. - We've got guests coming. - I know. Can I put them off? I'll make up an excuse. I have no intention of spoiling your little gathering. Don't change anything for me. It's simple. Just ignore me. Come on. Let's have some fun and games. Have you got anything to treat poor Pierre with? There's some mouthwash in the bathroom cabinet. I'll take care of it. By the way, don't bother sounding the alarms. I've deactivated them. As for your phone, it's linked to your belts. So... one hello and boom. - Is that understood? - Yes. Gérard Soulier. It's a pleasure to meet you. Pass it to me. Oh, no! Come on. - When I've finished this game. - No. - Yes. - No. Yes. But your games last for hours! - Give it to me. - No. I need some mouthwash for your father. He's bitten his tongue. You could jump out of the window and warn the neighbours. - He'd only take it out on you. - There must be a solution. You're trained for this at the bank. Yes. Don't worry. We need to coax him, calm him down, negotiate with him. I'll handle it. He's definitely going to kill us. Otherwise he wouldn't tell us his name. He's wearing a mask. That means he wants to avoid any casualties. Pierre, what if he harms the children? He won't harm the children. Stop it. He won't harm the children. - Where are you going? - To see to my turkey. I need to baste my turkey. It would have been such a shame if you had jumped out the window. Do you know why? Because you would have exploded. By your age I'd been working for six years. It didn't hurt me. On the contrary, I was proud of it. Yes, I was proud of it. I can still remember my first pay packet. I'm not boasting. I was no genius. - Times have changed, Paul. - You've got to want it. - What do you want? - Nothing. Nothing? A kid with no ambition is a parasite. - Do you want to end up homeless? - Calm down. It's Christmas. - Now is not the time. - We always say that. As a result your son is a lazy sod who sponges off us. Kevin! I'm sick of your lectures. You can spend Christmas Eve without me. What are you doing? Go after him. No, thanks. Why are you doing this? The recession, my friend. The recession. Three years ago I was as well dressed as you are, head of an industrial surveillance firm. Surveillance. I kept an eye on things. An annual turnover of one million. Clients throughout Europe. And then... The unpaid bills mounted up. You know how it is. Luckily I had a special relationship with my bank. We knew one another well. We were friends. At least, that's what I thought. One day they cut me off. No more cash advances. They were worried my clients would go bankrupt. After two months that was it. I had to shut up shop. My life's work annihilated in a flash. I was penniless. My wife dumped me. She took my daughter, the house, the TV, the fridge. Everything. I just wanted a job and to get my daughter and my dignity back. I would have been more patient. I always support my clients. That's precisely why I picked you out of the five bank managers chosen at random. You seemed like a nice man. I'm a romantic. If I'm going to steal from those who stole from me, I might as well do it with the help of a nice guy. Why do we have to put up with them every Christmas? - They're not family. - We don't have any family, darling. - Did your Dad phone? - No. See? Don't forget. Any nonsense and I'll shoot, starting with the children. Mrs Boutonnier, didn't you hear the bell? Yes. - I didn't know if I was allowed... - She didn't know! Go on. Mrs Boutonnier? Yes? Merry Christmas. I was wondering if we'd got the wrong night. - Are you OK? - Maeva, you could come too. She left the hospital at five. Isn't that great? I didn't have time to warn you. The bookshop was packed. Here, sweetie. I've brought you a selection of my favourite books. Hello, Jeanne. Merry Christmas. - Maeva! - Hi, gorgeous. - You scared me in that mask. - My humble respects, madam. So you're not Pierre? I assumed you were Pierre. We were hoping you would come. She wasn't meant to be here. She's just out of hospital. She was hit by a reckless driver. - Was it the 15th or the 16th? - Can we change the subject? Who is this guy? He's here to entertain the twins. Aren't they scared? - What's that? - Police! - Don't open the door. - We've got you surrounded. The house is surrounded. It's Paul and Sylviane. Right. Let's go. I hope you're not going to show off all night. - I thought you were in hospital. - I got out today. Kevin will be disappointed. He's got a tummy bug. Mind how you cross the road from now on. Look left and right. - Hello. - Good evening. Look who's here. Pierre, you look quite the part. It's not Pierre. He's not that funny. Not him? How original to have a Father Christmas here. - It is Christmas Eve after all. - It's still original. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. What a lovely dress. You look gorgeous. Kevin's got a tummy bug. I... Good evening. And you look gorgeous, too Thank you. - Hi. - Hi, Paul. How are you doing? Are you bearing up? Champagne? I'd love some. Keeps the spirits up. Are you OK? Crikey! It's going everywhere. What's in this Apache tepee? I can smell young flesh. - Watch out, here comes the ogre. - I'm going to eat you all up. - Where's my knife? - I'm not scared of your knife. Father Christmas has got a gun and he's going to kill you. No, have mercy. Please don't kill me. Not me. - Always showing off. - I'm getting too old for this. - Drinks, ladies? - Thank you. - They're delightful. - They love you. Shouldn't we wait for Pierre? Yes, let's wait for Pierre. No, no, no. No alcohol for Maeva. She's on medication. Where's Pierre got to, then? He's changing his tie. He's such a playboy. Are you OK? You seem tired. God knows where they found that guy but I don't like the look of him. At last. Pierre! - Hello, everyone. - Hello. How are you? - You're hurt. - It's nothing. - I bumped into the shower screen. - I thought he'd bitten his tongue. So you decided on an invisible tie? You're the one who should bite your tongue. Are you OK? I've brought your favourite starters. Foie gras, lobster pâté. I can't tell you how hard it was to get the doctors to discharge her. Water? Thanks. Is that clown dressed up as Santa going to be staying all night? Is he a body guard? Is it because of the attack on the jewellers? Pierre is right to protect you. And dressing him up as Santa means the kids won't suspect a thing. Paul... The... You can tell me anything, you know. I'm more than just a friend. Here. This is for you. You can wear it when you like. Do what you like with it. OK? If you need my assistance, Mrs Boutonnier, just call me. I'm right here. By the way, Paul, I phoned Lambert's. Did they come? Yes. The boss came himself. 2,000 euros for the changing room. It's not as if we're PSG. I've got the paperwork. We can look at it over dessert. Must we talk about the football club whenever we meet? - Why not? - Shall we talk about Kevin's bug? There's so much going on. I find it exciting. As part of this evening's entertainment I propose a very simple game. Jeanne is going to select presents at random and unwrap them. Your task is to work out who these presents are for. Since Kevin hasn't deigned to spend the evening with us, he won't be getting his. - He's got a stomach bug. - Yes, yes. And I wasn't expected. Oh, yes, you were, young lady. I am a very provident Father Christmas. Over to you, Jeanne. So you're the entertainer as well? He's the entertainer. What are they doing here? Aren't those the earrings your mother gave you? Yes. They don't suit me so I gave them to Maeva. - They're too good. - And they have sentimental value. They don't suit me. Next. Jeanne. A bottle of sleeping tablets. You must be mistaken. That's not a present. It's an empty bottle. You're the one who's mistaken, Mrs Violet. My records are up to date. How do you know my name? I've confiscated the pills. I wouldn't want anyone doing anything stupid. What's he talking about? Who is the bloody bottle for? Who takes sleeping tablets? Pierre? No. Patricia? - Not me. - I certainly don't need them. I can vouch for that. She sleeps like a log. Surely you don't reproach me for having a clear conscience? It's nobody's, then. It is somebody's. - We don't know whose, though. - You have to find out. Maybe it's you. When your husband left you, you said you needed... That was ages ago. Your records aren't so up to date after all. I'll take it, but I'd prefer the earrings. - Just kidding, sweetheart. - No, Mrs Généssier. It's not yours. - It might be mine. - Oh? At the hospital they found traces of sleeping tablets in my blood. The trouble is, I've never taken any. Not even before your exams? So you think I take drugs now? I don't believe this. Calm down, darling. They might not be your test results. That hospital is useless. We don't know what to do, Mummy. I don't know what to do. - Let's go down to your playroom. - Yes! No, stay here! They can watch another DVD. I'm going to show you my toys. I'm not coming. I'm sure your parents would like some time alone with their friends. I'll get the next course. Where did you find that body guard? He's a bit heavy-handed. I'll be right back. I'm going to help Patricia. What's going on? - I think they've had an argument. - So that's it. Don't you think he's a bit heavy-handed? He is heavy-handed, but... It's a nice idea, having Father Christmas here. I'm going to crack up. I can't take any more. - I can't take any more. - Calm down. We must stay calm. I don't want him to be alone with the children. Don't worry. He won't hurt them. How do you know? What's the story with the earrings? What do you mean? This is hardly the time. Tell me. - She stole them from me. - Who did? Maeva stole them from me. What? Why didn't you tell me? Because it was one afternoon... It was the day before her accident. I forgot all about it. Pierre. - Promise me we'll get through this. - Of course we will, my love. - Promise me. - We'll get through it. Of course we'll get through it. All right? Yes. You're not talking or eating. Are you both OK? We're OK. Forgive us. We're a bit exhausted. The children... It's the Christmas holidays. They've been so excited. I've had a lot on my plate. It feels weird not having them under my feet. Well? - This is a sordid game. - Where's your sense of humour? Don't be so negative. It's hideous. I'm sorry. We didn't know he'd do this. We recruited him on... On the Internet. You get all sorts of con artists on the Internet. It's a piggy bank. Piggy bank, money, bank. It must be mine. Yes, but why a naked woman? Yes, why a naked woman? No idea. If it had been pig-shaped, we'd have known it was for me. I think I know why. Are you playing or what? What do I press? - To go forward? - Yes. Press X. You're very quiet. I was thinking. What about? About you. Are you married? Do you have children? We all know you're sleeping with her. I'm not sleeping with her. What are you talking about? Me? - It's the slimming pills. - Stop it, Paul. Easy. Are we having cheese? - Sit down, darling. - You're a pervert! You're sleeping with a kid. OK, so she's a slut, a prick-tease, a tart. She's out of her mind! - I'm leaving! - Go on, then. You leave! Calm down. Can't you see she's lost the plot? - It's a misunderstanding. - I'm tired. I didn't come here to be insulted. Do you want me to smack you? Stop it! It's OK. Did you see the way she spoke to me? - I feel as if you all believe her. - Of course we don't. Calm down, Sylviane! She'll apologise. He's killed my children! - My baby! - Jeanne! Are you all right, baby? Are you all right, sweetie? - And the twins? - They're fine. We were just having a bit of fun. I didn't think it would be so loud. Come here, Jeanne. Let her go. Come here. Did you say you thought he'd killed your children? Did I say that? You've gone too far, you know. This is no way to behave. We've had enough of you and your perverse little game. - Are you talking to me, Mr Violet? - Yes. I think you should go. Really? Stop it, Paul. Calm down. Let me talk to him in the kitchen. No, you leave this to me. All right? - You're a pain in the arse. - No, you're the pain in the arse. It's a water pistol. He sprayed me with it earlier. Don't threaten me, you bastard. Take your things and go. The bastard! What a bastard! I'll be fine. It's not your fault. Why are you all looking at me like that? Don't you think it's time you made coffee for your guests? Take Jeanne with you. She's seen enough for one night. Would you rather I finished the poor bastard off? No! But that's what you think of him. You think he's a bastard. Please don't. Please. I know everything. I've been watching your houses, tapping your phones and hacking into your computers. I know all about you and your little habits. I've been watching you phonies for nine months. Has he? I installed cameras and microphones everywhere. I know all about your pitiful lives. Have you forgotten, Boutonnier? I used to work in surveillance. That's impossible. Do you think so? Remember the day your mobile broke and you got a new one in the post? It was a lovely new phone. Its chip gave me access to all your calls and texts. "Mummy's little sweetie pie! Mummy loves you." You can't have tampered with mine. I've had it for two years. Poor Mrs Violet. If only you knew. I'm losing blood. We must do something or he'll die. Maybe. It could be a chance to relieve Kevin of his authoritarian father. Meanwhile you, Sylviane, could start afresh, without the husband you've been refusing to sleep with for 20 years. Did she tell you that? This is nothing to do with me. - Mum, tell them I'm not like that. - Calm down, darling. Since this man knows everything, he'll know that, too. At some point you're going to have to tell them, Muriel. Bandage it up. You mustn't be cross with me. I didn't mean to hurt him. He forced me to. Do you believe me? I know you believe me. Go back and play with the twins. I need you to keep them occupied. You're the only decent person in this house. Are you expecting someone? No. - It's Kevin. - Don't let him in. Shut up! Don't treat me like an amateur. Who is this nerd? I don't know. I've never seen him before. - I think he's the new neighbour. - When did he move in? I don't know. A couple of days ago perhaps. No messing around. There will be sanctions. Get rid of him before I get angry. Think of your children. Good evening. Sorry to disturb you at Christmas but I heard two bangs. The last one sounded like a gunshot. I'm a hunter so I know what a shot sounds like. I nearly phoned the police but then I thought I'd come over and see for myself. We let some fireworks off for the children. - But we've finished now. - Fireworks? Right. It really sounded like a gunshot. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, sir. I hate traitors. - We haven't done anything. - Really? I hoped it wouldn't come to this. But since I can't trust my favourite banker, he's going to put belts on his guests. Take them. Take the belts. Stand up, Muriel. Put it on. Go on, get a move on! Stand up, Maeva. Here! Here. Put it on her. Take your own belts, Mr and Mrs Violet. Take your own belts. And what do these belts do, eh? They blow up. Right. Demonstration. The other side of the table. Go round the other side! Sit down. Sit! It's running. It's no use trying to pull off or cut through your belts. That will instantly lead to an explosion. Just by pressing this button I can blow you all up, just like that lovely cow. You will all agree that it's best if things go smoothly. Early tomorrow Mr Boutonnier will accompany me to the bank so that I can do my Christmas shopping. Then I will give him the code to defuse the bombs. Have you all got that? - Presents! - Presents! This stocking is mine. It's got a suit of armour in it. You only get one stocking. The other one is mine. But there's a suit of armour in it. - I was going to call you. - We want our presents. Go ahead, but don't pinch anything from anyone else's stocking. This box is mine. That little one, too. I fancy some yule log. Don't you? Christmas isn't Christmas without a yule log. Go on, shift your arses. Why didn't you sound the alarm? No chatting in the kitchen. Hurry up. Dad, I got a laser sabre. Beads! You brought me beads! - Did you read my letter? - Of course. A boy at school said you didn't read them. I read them all. This proves it. Will you play with me, Daddy? - Not now, sweetheart. - Please. I want to play now. Now is not a good time. Maybe later. - I'm going to kill you. - Pierre! Stop it, Julien. Paul is tired. Keep an eye on him, will you? Very funny. I'd like to see you try. Stop it, Julien. You'll hurt someone. Since your parents seem to be faltering again, the only sensible person in this house will put you to bed. Jeanne! - But... - No buts. Go to your room and not another word. Come on, please. - I want my toys. - It's not fair. It's not fair. We haven't even opened our other presents yet. It's so annoying! We're never allowed to stay up. I'm starving. Who wants some yule log? An envelope. We'll see what's in it later. What have we done to you? Why are you doing this to us? It's a perverse game. He wants us to kill one another. Belt or no belt, I'm not playing. - I'm too old for playground gossip. - So we see. May I remind you that I have two pistols? One contains water. The second, as Mr Violet can confirm, shoots real bullets. So shut up! And let's have some fun. - I'm not playing. - Shut up, Sylviane! An empty chest. A camera. There. All the presents have been unwrapped. Everyone take theirs. Maeva. Well done. The camera is mine. I film my children all the time. You guessed wrong. The camera is mine. What are you talking about? I know what I'm saying. And what do you film? Muriel. All right, I get the message. I'm the one who's sleeping with Paul. It started one night when he gave me a lift home, the first time we'd been alone since François dumped me. He was troubled, clumsy, charming. You could see he wasn't used to that sort of intimacy. And for the first time in a long while I felt like a woman again. Afterwards I asked him to pay me. I don't know why. I didn't know about the camera. It was easy with the cuckolded wife and the girl, wasn't it? But you didn't dare with Patricia. And yet, whenever you see her, you sweat like a pig. You're way out of line, Sylviane. Paul has always been courteous. And I'm married. But you disappear for hours on end. Play the game, Mrs Boutonnier, or you'll be eliminated. How is she meant to reply to these insinuations? She has shopping to do, that's all. Since it's that simple, I suggest we get her to read out her shopping list. Go on. I don't know what this has got to do with me. "Paternity test." What are you insinuating? She's fragile. Do you want to destroy us? My mother is fragile, too. But you just left her to it. Don't you think she's got something to hide, too? Maeva, I'd keep my nose out of this if I were you, OK? Are you sure you're the father of your children? How dare you? You can't believe she gave me those earrings out of kindness? Patricia told me everything. You're a dirty little thief. You all make me sick. She gave them to me to shut me up. 30, 31, 32, 33... Mummy's home, kids. I'm off. - Stay a bit longer. - I had a great hiding place. He was under the table. I'm going under there next time. Mummy! Are you leaving already? - Do you want a drink? - No, I've got to go. Maeva. Thanks for looking after the children. - They're very fond of you. - We get on well together. I really appreciate you, too. I hope the feeling is mutual. Here. Take them. I'd like you to have them. As a token of our friendship. It wasn't because of the earrings that I said nothing. It's just that I was ashamed for her. - Say something, Patricia. - Don't insult Patricia like that. - Keep out of it. - Don't talk to me like that. - Take back what you said. - Who do you think you are? Stop it! I'm in love with you. I have been for years. It's driving me crazy. I know you don't see it. I don't care. You're doing my head in. Playtime is over. Will the bashful lover kindly sit down and stop bending our ears with his sob story? What do you know about my life, you moron? You're nothing but a parasite, trying to get money at our expense. But you don't scare me. What are you all waiting for? We're not his bloody puppets. Come on! OK, it's half-time. Time to set up the psychological support unit. This is the last time I spend Christmas Eve with you arseholes. Don't just leave him here. I don't want the kids to see this. What do we do now? Wait for him to kill us one after the other? No. He won't kill again. It was an accident. That guy's not a murderer. You're right. How long is it before you have to be at the bank? Less than two hours. Paul was a nice man. What's the use in being nice? My daughter is like you. She understands everything. One day she will live with me. I'm sure of it. And we'll make up for lost time. So much lost time. She's your age, you know. But she's got dark hair. Dark hair with a dimple in each cheek when she smiles. She's so cute when she smiles. But... now... We used to do so much before... Before what? I used to take her pony riding. I took her to the pond to feed the ducks. And then she left with her mother. Why don't you kidnap her? When you love someone, you can kidnap them. You're entitled to kidnap your own daughter. It's jewellery. It must be for one of you two. No, it's for you. He told me in the kitchen earlier. He was hoping you'd like it. I knew he was seeing someone, once a week. I thought it was Maeva. It was driving me mad. Monday was our only day off. We could have gone to the cinema or the shops. Instead, I was alone, waiting for him. One day I cracked up. I decided to get rid of her so that he would come home and spend the afternoon with me. - Hello, sweetie. - Hello, Sylviane. For once. Excuse me. I'm just going to the loo. I put tranquillisers in her coffee. It was easy. Everything went according to plan. My head is spinning. She was yawning when she kissed me goodbye. I told her to go home and rest. Hey! Are you OK? You tried to kill my daughter. Of course not. You tried to kill my daughter. You wanted me dead? I don't believe this. It's insane! How many of you think I sleep with married men? You're sick. Pierre, did you know about Paul and Muriel? He told me they'd got together after François left. You never said. He was my friend. Is that what friendship means to you? Keeping your mouth shut? Not getting involved so as not to create a scandal? "We jump on top of him, "tie him up and call the police." We didn't think it would work. You haven't signed it. On the other hand, the left-hander here has agreed to this proposed putsch. Or should I say, the left-handed female. It's easy to spot the enthusiasm of youth. And there are two more signatures, both written by women. I'd say... Muriel and Sylviane. Neither of them subscribe to it. They probably don't want to spoil a convivial evening among friends and they balk at the idea of taking any physical exercise. What can we deduce from this note? Well, Maeva? Nothing. Brave, maybe, but not foolhardy. So, Pierre, what conclusion can be drawn from reading this note? I don't know. That we don't know whether it was Mrs Boutonnier or you who came up with this plan. We didn't do anything. I think it was her. And I'm going to kill her. No, stop. It was me. It was nothing to do with her. Why are you doing this? Is one dead person not enough for you? Do you want to know what it feels like? Go on. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot! This joke is starting to wear thin. There are still some presents to allocate. Go on, Mr and Mrs Boutonnier. Go for it. I thought it was nothing to do with you. Shut up. Your turn. What's that meant to symbolise? My accounts. Paul's, too. Your accounts? And Paul's? The charcuterie? I invested badly and lost everything. The money Paul entrusted me with, too. We're ruined. It's time. - Let's go. - No, there's no point. It's the same for you. All the safes are empty. The money was taken out at midnight. You must be joking! You knew he was taking you to the bank. By now Roussel will have crossed the Swiss border. Did you know I was coming? Do you mean you could have avoided this carnage? You're a monster. - Shut up. - You want me to shut up? Well, I'm not going to shut up, you bastard. You're worse than him. You've taken us hostage. You killed Paul. I've been planning this for months. Where did it go wrong? A fortnight ago a security guard spotted you on several occasions. He alerted Roussel who is in charge of security. Then when I saw you prowling round my house, we made the connection. Your house? Around your house? You are not alone in this house. Your children live here, too. Did you think of them and me? Why didn't you tell me? We could have gone elsewhere. It was never meant to happen like this. I don't understand. Do the police know? No, we decided to keep it to ourselves and say nothing, to set a trap for him. Roussel needed money, too. Go back to bed. - A robot belt! - Put that down. It's not yours. - Stop it. - Put it on! Examine the facts. Don't underestimate anyone's motives. Roussel would just need to kill Boutonnier during the hold-up. That would get rid of a burdensome husband and free up all the money, yours truly being the ideal suspect. My friends, we have reached an impasse. The easiest thing would be to kill you all. Why would Roussel want to kill me? I am reluctant to kill Jeanne and the illegitimate twins. - I forbid you to touch my kids. - It might upset Roussel. Why do you keep going on about Roussel? Doesn't he know? He's Patricia's lover. Now you understand why he'd want to kill you. - Don't leave on my account. - I was going anyway. - Try not to be too late home. - I promise. Well? The last patrol will be at five o'clock. He'll force you to open up soon afterwards. When will he turn up at my house? Just before that, to tie up your wife and children. - I'd say about four o'clock. - Might he be violent? Whatever happens, don't put up any resistance. He's only interested in the money. Once you're in the bank, do exactly as he says. I'll be hidden in the vault. Once he enters, I'll overpower him. You're lying. He'd never have dreamt this up. - What was the result of the test? - That they're Pierre's children. Of course. That was the plan. If we survive, I'm taking Jeanne with me. She's 11. She can choose to live with me. They're your children. Look. They're yours and you nearly killed them. - You haven't always been so sure. - It was him who doubted it. That's why I did the test, to stop him pestering me. I'm taking Jeanne with me. Please let us go. We've suffered enough, hearing about their sordid affairs. This has got nothing to do with us. I swear we won't tell anyone, ever. Let us go. Please. I'm begging you. Another show of solidarity, eh? You make me sick! What would you have done if the children had been Roussel's? I don't know. I can't believe you cheated on Pierre. I'd never have guessed. Pierre had his work, his bank and his clients. He was never around, even when he was at home. He worked at weekends. I... I felt invisible. Invisible. That's exactly how I felt when François left me. Paul reassured me. His hands and shoulders reassured me. The way he looked at me, too. I'm sorry. Less than five minutes to go. Here.. Thank you. I found it under your pillow. Did you listen to us? Let me go. Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just didn't want you to hear those dreadful things. What's the point of being a perfect little girl if you're surrounded by monsters? If I don't do something, you'll grow up to be like them. Look at Maeva. I'm sure she was radiant when she was your age. But they've gradually destroyed her with their adult stories. I'll never be like that. Juliette. My name's not Juliette. What is it? Shit! What have you done, Jeanne? No, not you! Why have you done this? No, not you! You must key in a code. 6-1-00. It's my daughter's date of birth. I'm not going with you. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
