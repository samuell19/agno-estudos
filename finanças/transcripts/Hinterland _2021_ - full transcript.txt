The world war is lost. Austria is shrinking from a proud great power to an insignificant small state. The emperor abdicates, the republic is proclaimed. War returnees come to a world where nothing is like it used to be. Some years after the end of the war. All for free... All for free. You made a sacrifice for our fatherland, and our emperor. That will never be forgotten. The letter... The letter... My mother... You promised. You'll give it to her yourself, Sesta. We're almost there. When we're out of bloody battle go home exhausted then the flags of victory shall wave everywhere. And announce... Goodbye, Sesta. He did not make it. Take off his clothes and throw him in the river. I promised him I'd take him home! Do you all want to go into the river? But that was not agreed! That wasn't a deal. Too many questions in port. No death, no problem. It means a lot to a mother to know where her son is. Who knows if there's still a mother after all these years. There, Vienna! Vienna! The Freudenau! Graveyard of the Nameless? The dead that wash up. Suicidal, murdered, the ones nobody misses. Heresmaty, come on. Gemma, Gemma out of the way! Gemma out of the way there! - First Lieutenant Perg, Imperial... - Two years too late. Out of the way with you! The sacks of coal should have been in the warehouse long ago and away with the ropes. What is that? Red-white-red, Republic of Austria. There are no more emperors. On the ropes to the other ropes! And the sacks of coal to the coal store. Where is Hrdlicka, that doesn't exist! March without a step. I myself Southern Front Isonzo. Five battles. St Germain. If you want to tell something about the war... People want to forget. Sir, with all due respect, my husband and I were prisoners of war for over two years for our fatherland and no one said... Everything has changed, nothing is as it was. dark times. Here. The Red House, homeless shelter. If you need something to sleep, to eat. You have been discharged from military service. Lieutenant, what's going to happen now? We don't have anyone but ourselves, do we? If you need anything then... Men! That was it then. Heresmaty. Farmer, we'll both see if they're there be able to cook a decent goulash. Kovacs. Farmer, take care. colonel. Much luck. You too, Herr Oberleutnant. Opium! Wonder drug of China! Forget your worries! Silver? From Aryan property! I guarantee. Or are you a Mosaic yourself? A penny, sir. Isonzo, Isonzo! Down your arms, comrade! Peace! Blood boy Haserl, no taboos. Dear boy? I would have a few fresh little boys. Who's there? Who are you? I'm calling the police! Yes, good boy. Jesus Mary, the gracious Lord. you got old Mrs Anna... I mean, the madam is no longer here. Lord, to beggars, they have made us beggars! I'd rather sleep on the street than in this, in this... Poor mouse feeding, damn it! Hi? Is there anybody? - Yes, come! - Wait a bit, not so fast! That's how I lived here, to watch out. Jesus, gracious Lord, take off your coat, they bring nothing but fleas into the beautiful apartment. It was bad for us. Really bad. Nobody had any more money. And then the father-in-law lost his entire fortune. War Bonds, damn it. She went to work, to the factory. So efficient, Mrs. Anna. Where is she now? Yes, everyone thought they weren't coming home. And then she went to her sister in Gumpoldskirchen in the country. There they have at least a little bit! had something to eat. Is Anna... I mean... is there... does she... A decent woman! She worked hard to get through with the child. Everyone's crazy since they haven't got the Emperor anymore. Everyone does what they want. Terrible. So I'm going back downstairs. I'll tell the lady, how happy she will be. No! I... I want to surprise her. Mr Police Council! - Good day. - Good day. Good morning, doctor. I think a good morning looks different, doesn't it? Male over 20, poor condition, imperial infantry uniform, officer, old gunshot wound, several badly healed cuts and bruises. war returnees. Half of all murder victims are war veterans today. And two-thirds of all murderers. So you found the body. Have you seen anything? - I just wanted to go with a john... - A john? - Name Address? - What? Just because someone is banging me doesn't mean I know who he is! It's some drunken Prater story. Severin? Arrest a few Strizis and Gypsies embarrassing questioning, then we'll see. We can't, just because this is a slum here... Then they just secure tracks, interview witnesses, the usual stuff. He was badly abused before he passed out. Inflicting pain must have been the primary goal. Experienced! Postmortem flatulence. Farting is one of the few things which can also be performed successfully after death. That is very interesting. Register with the Zionist Society! Palestine! These Eastern Jewish refugees everywhere! This is a rabble, a dirty one! They just want to live there at our expense. Is that what ours served for? I do not think so. Gumpoldskirchen, please. 70 groschen please. hold him! - Hey! - Hey, slow down! - Where to go so fast? - My wallet! - That man has... - Deport! Are you a late returnee? My discharge papers are in my wallet. - The man stole them! - Buddy! We're slowly emptying our pockets, okay? - Herr Police Council. - Yes? Among the items I found on the victim is a note. And? He is back. - Peter Perg! - What noise are you making? What are people supposed to think in this house, yes? Also, you break the door. You can't just go in there, I can register you. - What's going on here? - Peter Perg? - I said that's not possible. - You come with me. - Why? - But gentlemen policemen... We ask the questions here. Have you done something, sir? Where were you last night? Are the handcuffs absolutely necessary? - Where were you last night? - At home. witnesses? Has anyone seen you? I know what witnesses are. We can lock you up too. Peter, it really is you. how nice to see you Is that why you're letting me be taken away like a criminal? witnesses. I think you know what witnesses are. - He's clever, the young fellow. - What do you think... Come on let's talk in my office. Take off those stupid handcuffs. Yes, sir. Oh, sorry. police council? Respect. You've come a long way, Viktor. How nice to have you back. You look good. I live. You probably didn't expect that. Hurray after the imperial flag on the first day of the war. sense of duty, huh? You could have done your duty as a police officer here, like I did. Grow up, Peter. You made the wrong decision then. Wrong just because of Anna. Leave Anna out of it. There is a dead man. Where I was, it was everyday life. - The war is over. - Maybe he deserved to die. This was found on the body, dear Peter. It's very interesting, isn't it? Show. Probably a comrade of his. A Lieutenant Krainer. They came up the Danube from the Black Sea a few days ago. The two were in a Russian camp. Maybe they quarreled. Nail to a stake? Do you do that in a fight between friends? Yes / Yes... Gentlemen. This is Frau Doctor Körner, our medical examiner. The male colleagues have all been drafted and yes... That's why they put a shotgun in front of us. - Doctor, I would never say that. - Just think I know. Welcome back, Inspector Perg. Ah, you know each other, that's interesting. Yes, thrush marks on his neck, but he didn't die from that. wire loop. Yes, is he now, isn't he? Lieutenant Herman Krainer. Six years of duty. A day back at home. Who was not killed or maimed in that terrible war, came back with severe roof damage. - Excuse me Mr. Perg, that... - You didn't mean it like that. Even if... You would have been right. - Victor. - Pete. Mr Police Council. Madam. Doctor Körner, cross your heart. Do you think the perg might have something to do with this? Of course he has nothing to do with it. But on the contrary. If anyone can solve the case, it's him. He was your colleague, wasn't he? Au revoir, merci beaucoup, Colonel. Scrounger, shitty. Ah, Mr. Perg. I wanted to ask you for the apartment key, if you go to Gumpoldskirchen to see your wife. When are you leaving now? Who helped Anna when I wasn't here? Renner, the great benefactor? Be glad you have friends like this. Such a kind and generous man, Mr. Police Council. Should we starve because of such a stupid war? What do you know about war? That's correct. I don't understand war. A father's place is with his child. We needed you here. Do you want to be brave? Then stop running away. God! You want to add this perg to the corps? The victim had a piece of paper with his name on him. That's more of an indication that it wasn't him. This man is high on our suspect list. List? You already have other suspects thanks to your investigative work, yes? Perg, he's already hunted down criminals when you couldn't even pee straight. in the good old days where the police locked up some poor bastard for a bourgeois system? My brother never came back from the war - while rich falottes like Perg... - The war is over, goodness gracious. And by the way, be so good as to pick up colleague Perg at home. We have a new body. Wien Viaduct. Now to my colleague Perg. Zack, zack! Whether you used to be a police agent or not, I don't give a damn. Unless you have an alibi, you're the prime suspect. All wheels stand still when the red fist wants it! Come on, let's walk. - ID. - I belong to him. Severin. - Has anything changed? - No. That one, that one found the body. We immediately sealed off everything according to regulations. Hey kids, get over there! Gemma! rabble, dirty. Would you be so kind as to help me measure the body? Just ask our new colleague. I have you to thank for that, I hear. I don't trust that. A friend of the boss. But not with me. Devyatikhvostaya koshka. What? The Cat of Nine Tails. the whip? Yes. As if the flesh had been torn from the victim's body with small claws. And the crust on the wound? - I need the substance first... - Salt. Salt? So that he stays awake. You were right. My roof damage. Earlier at the crime scene, death, crime, suffering. That's where I felt at home for the first time and not like here, in a strange world. Would you like to join me for a coffee? I don't know if I fit into this environment. I invite you. If you can accept a lady's invitation. I am a war profiteer. Under normal circumstances, the professors would have turned me moldy - in the forensic archives. - The new times. If you make an effort, you will find a lot of good. Freedom, Justice, Change. i like change The only solution is anarchism! - anarchists. - Oh, not even. Communists when it comes up. Futurists, Dadaists, some Istists are all today. And you? Realist. Despite the reality? Precisely because. And pacifist. All this war romance with honor, loyalty, fatherland. - You can't understand? - No. To put comrades above one's own family. What did your wife say when you came back? Who knows if she even wants me back? How am I supposed to put my daughter through someone like me? What are you afraid of? Sorry, I have no right to talk to you like that. I'm sure your wife still loves you. Thanks for... How stupid... Have you ever seen a dead man? My father. And now he has a stepdad to spank him. You know, I can't even imagine that such an old man found the dead man first. earlier than you. Him with only one leg, crutches and her? Such smart fellows. Maybe there were things like that? I know it's very possible that missing soldiers... Yes, exactly, my brother, Corporal Josef Severin, K.u.K. Dragoon. What do you mean, unanswered? What? i have her The Cat of Nine Tails. What irritates me is that the dead man's fingers and toes were cut off. There is a new method that one can determine the identity of a person with fingerprints. You don't have to believe every newfangled nonsense, Severin, please. Sorry. Maybe a ritual? Then why put a finger on it? About the homicide squad... We talked about your re-admission. actually looks very good but you won't get around a little trial period. Trial period... Do you know how much I've worked for you? How are Anna and Magdalena? marlene Marlene will be fine. Peter, you haven't been... Perg! Count of Starkenberg. Mr. Starkenberg, recently. I'm about to have you arrested for monarchist activities. Former criminal inspector Perg returned from captivity and supports us in a very interesting case. What is the name of Russia now? Soviet Union. Not Perg? Were you also turned over by the Reds? - Chief Police Officer, I understand your... - It was just a question, comrade Perg. Dictatorship of the proletariat, an attractive idea, isn't it? Are you a communist now? I have faithfully served my fatherland. See how he skillfully dodged? You learn that from them. We don't want a red adder's nest, here at police headquarters, isn't it, Renner? Of course not Herr Graf... Herr Starkenberg. Has the case at least been solved, thanks to Bolshevik help? - We're close. - Very good! The interior minister has a press conference in a week. Either he talks about the solved case, or he says that a Bolshevik cell in the Presidium was smoked out. racer! We are confident. They can't cook either, the Salvation Army women. We are treated like dirt, like the last scum. "The sacrifice for your emperor will never be forgotten." An Austrian comrade does that. A private. National Socialists. They're the only ones who understand us. Who care about us. First Lieutenant Krainer was killed. Krainer no longer wanted to live. Didn't want to anymore. He's right. He's not that crazy, the farmer. Krainer no longer wanted to live. Kovacs... Krainer was here with you in the Red House, yes? No, eventually he will be gone. how away Was anything noticeable? There was a man... What a man? Farmer, what kind of man? You don't look each other in the face here. Everyone is ashamed. Mom, mom, mom look! What have you seen again? Go, Marlene. And have we already been to the wife? The silver candlesticks, the Klimt drawings, our things that you are guarding, you can now take them upstairs again. You can also say it in a friendly way. Police councilor Renner always gave me a tip. And if it was in the morning, then twice. Hi! Dear, hello! Victor! Where are you?! Peter, what are you doing here? are you crazy That's fine. He is a friend. I have always loved her. From the first moment. It was in the darkest hours, back in the eighteenth year. We hadn't heard from you for three years. Nothing. It's been four weeks. At some point I realized that she only sleeps with me Because she knew she'd never fall in love with me. That I would be no threat to her love for you. I was never more than nice to her. I actually took Veronal, but even for suicide I'm probably too dull. Peter? Peter? So... Now that might hurt a bit. But the scars heal very well. Don't move now... Good. And? It shouldn't press. 19 beautiful, white teeth. 19 teeth... Be right back. Are you inviting me to something? Normal costs 10, perverse 15. What do you want from me? What do you want from me? You know we couldn't help it! Out! Go away you ass! I'm sorry, doctor. Mr. Perg won't be back here until tomorrow morning. Good. - Thank you, good evening. - Doctor. Excuse me. Pardon. You were just in the inspectorate. You searched Perg. You're giving Perg information that you're not giving me? You don't really know who Perg is, do you? Do you know the report case? The Colonel Report? Yes. The green widow? The Stankowski case? - And Perg has... - Yes. the butcher of hernals, who violated and mutilated women when they could do more than cook and pray or was possibly better than a man? It was enough if there was a shorthand typist in forensic medicine. I'm sorry for that. If it wasn't for Perg, I wouldn't be standing in front of you now. And a man like that has to let himself be humiliated now to be reinstated in the police force. 19 wooden pegs. They wanted to know what I wanted to say to Perg. The first victim was pierced by 19 wooden stakes. 19 pegs. 19 fingers and toes. Maybe a coincidence. You are the detective! What do we have here? There look. Stop! arrest me please I'm a dirty coward. Now let's sleep off the intoxication, shall we? And we'll be happy to arrest you tomorrow. - My wife, she will leave me. - I believe that. She hates me. I lost the whole war. What? Would you rather go to the port than to a woman? Lost everything. Just you and me. Look at me. Look at me, dammit! You! You won't make it, you won't break me. For God, Emperor! And fatherland. you all cheated on me... I have something for you. Oh god no. No! Hi! Police! Police help! No quick death. Wait for suffering. Hi? Hey! What are you doing? Do we have you, laddie! Now you come in the ports, you sow. No! There you stay. We'll grab your accomplices later. - Warden] Your boyfriend has... - He's not my boyfriend. Herr Perg brunzt on the altar, so urinated. Herr Perg is an important witness. Folks, hear the signals... Keep your eyes open, otherwise I'll lock you up with the German Nationals! Maybe, but this is a blasphemous brunch... urinate. Listen, sir, the man is... He's the best criminalist we have. One signature, three copies. Wait there. You got lucky. If you hadn't peed on the altar would not have called the woman for help. She didn't even realize that you were fighting for her life. Körner told me about you Your successes, your mother from the tanning district... She wouldn't have... I don't think that was a coincidence. You got too close to him with your investigations. Crime is a disease that will be cured when the social question is solved. What, you don't believe in the evil in people? I believe in the possibility of a just world. International, in solidarity, without war, without hunger and without crime. My brother brought me to socialism. He always said... Severin. I overheard the phone call because of your brother. And that you still hope. Missing for two years. Virtually no chance. Still hoping is the greatest torment. I have known him. Corporal Josef Severin. Fourth Dragoon. In stock. He is dead. She... I stumbled. i was ten There used to be a ship graveyard out in the bay. I broke through the deck of a rusted tugboat while playing hide and seek. The others were desperately looking for me. A storm came during the night for two days. And me the whole time in stinking brackish water with a smashed leg. I was too exhausted to keep screaming too exhausted to resist the rising Danube for much longer. The search parties had given up. They were sure I drowned or was swept away by the current. Only my brother stayed outside. Against all reason. Until he found me. He never gave up. He was brave. Until the end. Excuse me. Doctor Korner. - May I? - Yes I... I got from your... - Yeah, um... - Heard mishap. Yes... He struck again. In case you haven't been informed yet. no What happened? The victim was placed in a rat cage with her thighs. With two dozen hungry rats. - rats. - Who does something so inhuman? Inhuman? Open the newspapers. Killing and tormenting is typically human. He's vain in a perverse way. He creates tableaux of death. I understand the affect, the passion, the madness I even understand war And there may be emergencies that force people to do horrible things, but... Mr. Perg? What is that? American Negro Music. They call it jazz. But they are not Negroes. Admit it, they liked it, didn't they? I saw your foot tapping. Before I left the city, there was only the Danube Waltz and operettas. After that, a time machine spat me out of here. Thank you for escorting me home. It was nice. I thought so too. What are you thinking about? Are you allowed to be happy? We have to go to the crime scene. - Hoffmann, you stay here. - Yes indeed. The victim was a day laborer named Eugen Richter. And the grains figured out the identity of the one under the bridge. Was a soldier once too, a Colonel Bernfeld. Bernfeld... Eugen Richter was not a day laborer. He was a cavalry captain. And did you know him too? - We have to see Renner, now. - Saturday afternoon? - I don't know where he... - Although Renner changes minds, but never his Saturday afternoon habits. Good evening gentlemen. Are you already a member of our club? Severin, how did the man get out of prison? We don't have time now. Shut up, Victor. We know the killer's motive. In the POW camp where I was the highest penalty was always the maximum penalty for attempting to escape. - The death. - No, worse. Running the gauntlet, the Nine Tails, the rat hole, ice water swimming. And in the end, finally, the anger of the comrades. How so? If an escape attempt was not reported by your own people, every tenth prisoner in the camp was shot. Decimate... We were only 50,000 of the original 240,000 men. Typhus, dysentery, hunger, cold. And the shootings. The Russian. Just as bad as the Englishman, the Frenchman and us. There was a committee in the camp. A committee of six officers representing our people. At some point they found out that 20 new prisoners were planning an escape. So the committee ordered them not to flee, asked her, begged her. Until finally they could convince one of the 20 to tell them when the others would flee. The officers then had only one choice. They reported the escape and saved the lives of 5,000 men. And the others? The 19? They were so tortured that whoever betrayed her has lost his mind. You haven't seen anything like that yet. Are you finally getting to the point? Our case? Krainer, Bernfeld and Richter were members of this committee. Why did the murderer keep his fingers crossed for Bernfeld? He didn't let him keep his thumb, but cut off 19 of his limbs. Krainer was pierced by 19 wooden stakes and I'll bet you there were 19 rats in the cage. 19 men were betrayed. Apparently one survived. We need to find the rest of the committee. Because they're next. And who were the other members of the committee? August Wehninger from the Wehninger Brewery and Count Heresmaty. But you said it was six? The sixth never came back. Let's not waste time. Peter, not you. Starkenberg overheard your altar story. For him it is equal mockery of religion, Bolshevism. I'm not going to dig my own grave for your church burnout. - You can't do that! - You are outside. I'm sorry, it's not my fault. Hoffman, backwards. - Hoffmann. - Yes indeed. We're only taking Mr. Perg part of the way with us. Purely private. Of course, Commissioner. Purely private. - Hoffmann, you stay here. - Yes indeed. The young count? Didn't you hear? Two days after his return... poof. The palace now belongs to of the Lower Austrian fire insurance. They let him stay in the porter's lodge anyway, meanwhile. He wasn't happy anymore. Yes, the new times... It may have saved him a horrible death. Maybe... he missed an interesting life. Commissioners Perg and Severin. Sorry for the disturbance, we are urgently looking for Mr. August Wehninger. Please. Where is Captain Wehninger? He left early this morning, maybe to the brewery. Thanks Fritz, we'll take a ten-minute break. Do you like it? Captain Wehninger told me about a chouchou and that she is waiting for him. Choucho... He had said "she"”. He or she, nowadays... Only love counts, doesn't it? You are Major Perg, with whom August was at war and in captivity. He always said: "The Perg and I were stronger, because we knew that someone was waiting for us." Did he spend the night here? Surely you're not thinking of "fornication against nature"? Of course not, because that's forbidden in our oh so modern republic. But he's lying! Gentlemen, it was really very interesting. But if you don't have a search warrant... We reserve the right to further inquiries. He told me about you. He liked you. A friend. Apparently not friend enough for hiding an important aspect of his life from me. Could you have handled the knowledge? Camaraderie, trench romance... If you guys weren't so afraid to touch each other in peacetime, then we wouldn't need any more wars. Kiss August for me. He's safe at the brewery. - Sorry. - Was unintentional, sorry. Maybe a fuse. I do not know either. August, it's Perg! Captain Wehninger? Hi? Hoffmann! Damned! Forgiveness. I found this. There. Chloroform. - Yes. - Get reinforcements, now! Yes indeed!! Perg, attention! Oh God. We have now found 18 blocks of ice with body parts. - It will be nineteen. Keep searching. - Yes indeed. The murderer wanted to avenge 19 people who had been tortured. But the interesting question is what about the twentieth who betrayed her to the committee? Who went insane? A scoop of soup, a piece of bread, gentlemen. Only one creator, gentlemen! Mr. Lieutenant. Corporal. Come. It's about farmers. Where is he? He's grabbing an extra portion of feed. We have found the Wehninger. murdered. Krainer, Bernfeld, Richter, all dead. The committee? where is farmer Where is he! You don't think that Bauer... You know Bauer. - Listen to me... - No. - Listen to me, Kovacs. - No. Perhaps Bauer regrets his betrayal and now wants revenge on those he holds responsible for it. Maybe his condition is just played. Farmer, tell them all this can't be true! That's him, grab her! Come on Gemma Gemma! No! Away away! - Leave me, you pigs! - Soldier! Take a stand! Let go of the man. Farmer, I just want to talk to you. Chill out. Nothing happens to anyone. This is Hoffman. He's a good guy. he is innocent No more innocent people should die. You know that. It's our fault. The dead comrades. - I just... - I know. Let him go. Yes. let him go yeah give me the knife Farmer... They shot him. The one from the backcountry. Farmer! Farmer! Are you one of them again, huh!? And fuck the camaraderie, huh!? Perg! Perg! - He's just a witness... - I'll take care of it. Very good job Peter. That would have solved the case. Welcome back to the police force. Full salary with pension entitlement. I owe you an explanation. I am so sorry. My wife... We don't owe each other anything. It's nice with you now and tomorrow is tomorrow. As simple as that? no It's terribly complicated, of course. But not while dancing in the Prater. Marlene... Homecoming beast shot, four murders! Stop, police! Homecoming beast shot, four murders! Homecoming beast shot, four murders! I? Forgiveness. Pardon. Hi Peter. You? Where is my daughter? what did you do to her Where is she? You can't threaten me anymore. I'm already dead. give me the gun Otherwise you'll never find out what's going on with your family. - No. - Come on, give me the gun. Please where is she? Come. And when was Bauer not with you yesterday? I already told you that. I have nothing to do with it. Ever heard of complicity? This way. There! Show. Your wife. She got a letter from her husband that he is coming home from the war and wants to meet her right away. Now her husband has sent her a message. She's supposed to come to St. Stephen's Cathedral for the big peace mass. do you see the package She doesn't know it's a mustard gas bomb with a timer. If she goes into the cathedral, a few thousand people will die. If you shoot her, she'll hardly notice. Puff. Out of. What do you think Perg? The calculation is even simpler than it was back then. A life against that of a few thousand churchgoers. Anna dies one way or the other. The bullet or the gas. If you shoot the mother, you save the child. Peter, come on, pull the trigger. On the other hand... the good fools down there think you can pray away war and evil. Let them die, it's not a pity for them. Come on, shoot! The beautiful doctor will comfort you. You only have a few seconds and then you can't do it anymore, Peter. Come on, shoot! Come on! Shoot! I could never harm an innocent child. You damn... And how did you know them? High officers, you as a meaner? - From the prison camp. - Ah. They were on the committee. Richter, Bernfeld, Wehninger, Heresmaty, Krainer... Krainer and Perg. Perg was on the camp committee? I've lain with the dead. Killed like an animal. God let me survive so I could share my pain. We were responsible for fifty thousand men. Fifty thousand! Men? Cripples and sick people just waiting to die. We, we would have had a chance. My men who handed you over to the torturers. I owe you this. Who do you think you are, to be able to decide who has a right to live and who doesn't, huh? are you god God died in the war. Now I am the god of vengeance. The harbinger of the next great killing. Bauer isn't a murderer, believe me. Because I believe you, I know Perg is in danger. If he's still alive. - Is there an Inspector Severin here? - Yes. A man sent me. I should say "Perg" and "Pummerin". pummerin? - The bell in St. Stephen's Cathedral? - And nineteen. Hoffmann, large-scale operation! You would have let thousands die for your wife. And you didn't care about us. Don't you understand that I have to avenge my comrades? What we did was wrong. Wrong because there was no right. Yes, there is nothing right in this world anymore. Nineteen died because of you. come here peter And I'm deader than the others. Do you remember how they killed young Meierhofer? Disemboweled, alive. His screams were terrible. Police, open the door! Hoffman, I'll go alone. stop! I think I met him. The pig is mine. Get reinforcements! No wait. hey! You don't want him to have to do it, do you? give me the gun - Perga! - Stay where you are! Are you crazy! - Get out of the line of fire! - Perg] Severin, stay where you are. You're not supposed to be here. What does he say? Step aside, Perg! - Do what he says! - Shut your damn mouth! Severin, stay where you are! I won't let him kill you. - Out of the way! - No! Joseph... You met me, little brother. Why... why aren't you... I did not know... What have I done? You brought down a murderer. Joseph, come with me. Come home, I... Come home, I... Please, I was looking for you! I did everything! I know, I know... I'm so glad I saw you again. Joseph, come. perg. Go to hell! No! you knew it You knew! you knew it You should have told me that. He wanted to believe that his brother is a hero And I let him believe Hero? First, in the war, you shoot each other dead and then at home your own comrades. It's also easier to kill someone than risk a meaningful life. So bad? Do you need our dashing Frau Doctor as a coroner? Don't look so snivelling. We both managed that brilliantly. Doctor, Peter, see you Monday morning, start of work. I'll bring croissants with me. All these years I've thought of nothing but going back and now... But that can also be the return to life. into a new life. That can also be nice. I'm a different person than the one who went to war back then. Anna is a different person after all these years. I have no idea if these two strangers still have something in common, but... If I don't try now, then... Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
