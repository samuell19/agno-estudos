-It's cute! -Yeah! -I didn't ask your opinion! -That's sleazy! Antonio, did you hear your daughter? Another fight! I drove 200 miles, I am exhausted. Such an effort to come to Forte dei Marmi! -Ischia would have been a better idea. -Marina, I am going to slap you! Mum, I'm 20! I'm fed up to stick to my parents! Shut up! When you'll be 21, you can do whatever you want. -Where's the bag boy? -Dad, he's a porter! You don't need to teach me anything, you failed three classes! -Ah! -Be careful! -Welcome, good morning. -Finally! We are the Pinardi family, from Naples. The ones who booked in January? Come in. -Is there a view on the beach? -Stop it! Hey guy, is there a TV in the dining room? I have a soft spot for Corrado, "The jaguar's friend"! We've a real cool 21 inches TV. -21 inches, great! -We're the only ones with a 13 inches. -Everyone has a 21 inches! -Shut up! A seaside resort is like a small community. People know each other and are connected by small plots to spend their time. But the Pinardis, who came to Forte dei Marmi for the first time, were feeling a bit excluded. -Paolo, eat a supply. -I am not hungry, maybe later. Do you want a small pizza? A glass of cola? -Mum, we're on the beach, not in a snackbar! -I am hungry! -"Even Milva goes on holiday in Versilia!" -Who cares! Hey! Are you nuts? Don't talk to your father like that! -Who cares about Milva! -I'm sending you back to Naples. I wish you would do that! The family Carraro from Milan came to Forte dei Marmi for longtime. The old Carraro was one of the richest contractors in Lombardia and his wife was one of the most insufferable women in Italy. Their youngest son Luca was the worst scoundrel in Versilia. Luca, you can't enter the beach on your Vespa! Alright! # This summer same old plan, I came here just to have fun. And just like last year the stupid lifeguard is here his but already fleeced and tanned. Ve, ve-ry tanned! # Damn you! Son of a stupid! If I catch you, I'll spank you! SONG: "Non ho l'et? per amarti". The whale has swallowed the bait! Last night the hot bombs had success! Your fat flash is still hot! -Be careful, you're too healthy! -Luca, don't bother me! In the morning I have no energy at all! Selvaggia, is your boyfriend reading all the time? -What is it, Gino Bramieri's life? -No, I am reading Bevilacqua. If we don't get informed and just sit in the sun, we'll turn into animals! I am very much informed. Do you know the name of the Beatles' bass player? -Paul McCartney! -Who are these Beatles? -In English it means "cockroaches". -You are two mummies. Marchesini Pucci, in the morning try to leave the family picture! Luca, your brother has arrived. -Brother! -Hi, Felicino! She's Susan, I met her in London, in a new pub where they have a new dance: the "shake". -Brother, calm down. -See what a thing? -She has never been to Italy, so I invited her. -Leave me alone, stupid! -Did you find her at Oxford? -Be careful! -She has already learned Italian! -He is Luca. -Hi, Luca. -Hi, Susan. Have you already... "operated"? Sure, I invited her after the operation. -I don't want to talk about details. -I understand. -So, everything under control? -Yes, everything under control. -He Felicino, me felicina. Very pleased. -Very pleased. -I would like to be pleased too. -Be careful! -He looks like his brother. -"Brothers"! "Daddy", "Mummy"! Dad, mum! -The "prodigal son" is back. -How was London? -Cool. -Susan, she'll spend summer with us. -Hi, dad. Hi, mum. Stupid, try not to make her pregnant. Don't worry, I take the pill. Daddy, nowadays modern girls take the pill. I understand, just do not make her pregnant. Let's have a toast to the return of the big brother! Stop playing "Aga Khan" with your father's money! "Brother" is back after one year and you act as a beggar? Give me a loan, I'll pay you back when I'll get the inheritance. A big toast to the big brother! -Do you want some cola? -Yes, I do. -Paolo, what are you doing! -I am sorry, Marina. -You are so clumsy! -Sorry. -You hussy, come with us. -I am not hussy, it's fashion! What fashion, this is gross indecency! Cecco's word, I'll make a great report! Wait, I'll come too to the police station. They were right, there are children here! -But there are also adults. -Luca, nice joke! Am I right or not? -Oh, God! -Why are they arresting that woman? Because this is a Country of idiots! Let's go. Marina, we have a hot omelette! -Is Marina your name? -Me? Not. -Neither am I. -Marina, come! -I don't want to be recognized! -It's getting cold. Marina! -Is she your mother? -No, my mother is on a boat and my name is Barbara. I order you to stay here! Where do you want to go? Where do you want to hide? -Down. -Picture! -Shut up! -Who is he, Pappagone? It's a movie from the marquises: Sodoma and Gomorra. -I will them have out of this place. -Shut up. All the De Filippo are behind us? -Go on holiday to Taranto, at Nino. -That's cool! -Marchesini Pucci, are you cold? -It's damp here around. We're organized. Look. -What are you doing, the "Manon"? -Look who is here. James Bond, "Thunder operation". What are you doing? Marchesino Pucci, are you chasing butterflies? We are used to play on the English grass. Last winter I liked a lot the movie "Lawrence d'Arabia". -I would screw Peter O'Toole! -Also Omar Sharif is not too bad. Yes, I would screw him too. -What about Paul Newman? -I would screw him! And Steve McQueen? I would screw them all! -I'd screw Brigitte Bardot. -Go to Saint Tropez and try. No, you'd be jealous. I called her and I told her not to wait for me. Are you going to bed together? -What do you care? -Are you or not? -We can't say. I understand, you don't. When I'll be your age, I'll go to bed with my boyfriend. -What are we doing tonight? -I must stay home. A friend of my parents is coming for dinner. How annoying! Rosetta, take the dishes to the kitchen, I'll take care of the wine. -The cake is good, did you make it? -I did. -It's better to eat at home! -Restaurants are so expensive. Yes. Last night at the "Hunter" we spent 4.000 liras each. Nevertheless restaurants are always full. Everything is more expensive! A litre of gas costs 150 liras! And for good shoes you need 7.000 liras! And nannies are so expensive! Mine asked me raise. She wants 50.000 liras monthly. -That's crazy. -It is. -Gianni, can I have some wine? -Gianni! Give some wine to Adriana. -Let's drink not much, it's expensive. -Don't joke, I'll pay everything. -Got a light? -I'm sorry, I don't smoke. Sure, if he starts now, how would he feel 40 years old? -Almost all my friends do smoke. -Their loss! -Do you attend university? -Yes, fist year in Philosophy class. Soon everybody will be a philosopher and nobody will be able to repair a sink. I don't want to be a philosopher, I want to be a journalist. -He was always fond of writing. -Me too. -Why don't you become a writer, then? -I don't know... Maybe because I married too early, or maybe I can't write. It's late, I must go. -Is somebody coming with me? I'm scared to walk alone at night. -I am! Thanks, Gianni. Good night. -It was kind of you to come with me. -You are safe. Tonight Jack the Ripper was on strike! Good night. No, stay, in a few minutes my husband will be back. You can meet him. -Who is your favorite writer? -I have to think about that. -Do you want a whisky? -I don't know if... -Just say yes or not, it's not a philosophic matter. -Yes. My favorite writer is Francis Scott Fitzgerald. I read his novel "For whom the bell tolls". -No, Hemingway wrote that one. -Really? I am not that sure. I saw the movie with Gary Cooper. He was great. -Ingrid Bergman was too. -Will you help me to unzip it? -Do you have a girlfriend? -Yes... almost. -I bet she doesn't wear dresses with zip. -She doesn't. Thanks. I'll be back. SONG: "Tremarella". Are you crazy? Turn it off, my son is sleeping. I am sorry... I don't know... -Are you nervous? -Me? I am not. -What is your husband's name? -What do you care? I don't. Have you been married longtime? I am only 19, I can't have been married for longtime. -How old do you think I am? -I don't know... 34? -No. -33? -You are on the wrong way. Up. -35. -No. -36. -37. -No. -39? -You missed the 38. -38! -No. -40? -Yes. Since last month. -I read it is a nice age. -I read that too, bullshit. -Anyway, you look younger. -Still, I am that old. -You are a beautiful woman. -Do you think so? -I must go. -Don't you want to meet my husband? -He's honking. That's him. -I am going. Fix your hair, he might think you seduced me. -But I haven't done anything! -Then it would be stupid -to get a slap. My husband has a bad personality. -God! -Hi, darling. -Everything fine with your trip? A disaster, a big queue! -He's Gianni, Paola's son, he took me home. -Hello. -I was just leaving. -Where are you going? Adriana, you tell the story of your life, and people run away! -She annoyed you, didn't she? -No, your wife is very nice. You too. I am going to bed. Good night. -Good night. -I'll be with you soon. -Can you play cards? -Me? Pretty much. -Let's play rummy. -Isn't too late? No, just the time to get her asleep, so I don't fulfill my duty. After a week of work, I am tired. On the contrary, wives always think to that. -Let's play. -If you insist...! -Morino, give us the boat. -No, your father left and said that you can't touch the boat. -We'll be back before 1 p.m. -You can't touch it. -You tell him you did not know and that it is Luca's fault. -No! -I'll give you 1.000 liras. -You can't! -I see, 5.000. -I can't! I'll give you 15.000. Agree? -But you be back before 1 p.m. -Sold! SONG: "Abbronzatissima". -Vianello is good. -I don't like him. -The Birds are better. -Vianello, Birds, Beatles. The best is "The voice", the old, dear Frank. The last one who dives gives a kiss to Little Tony. I'll stay and kiss Rita Pavone. Are you always that friendly? Are you always that common? It depends. Sometimes I say: "Hi, how're you?" Sometimes: "Hello". In emergency cases I take it out right away to surprise them. -Stupid! Do you have a girlfriend in Milan? -That story is over. -Why? -She always called me stupid. -Stupid! -Do you have a boyfriend? -Yes and not. Before leaving we had a fight because he wanted me to go to Ischia. He said I am a free girl now. -Are you free? -I am free. -Aah! I can see the Mother Virgin! -Do you feel relaxed? Sure, you have Thai hands! -Shall we play dices? -Do you really want to give me some money? I'll give you a slap you'll feel dizzy for a week. -Do you know how they called me when I was your age? -Felicinino. No, "The nuts punisher"! Come on, I'll draw it first. I am the number one in this game! Ten! Don't bother me while I'm playing! Are you mad at me? Would you make me a sandwich? I'm hungry See? The more you treated them bad... -Wow... -How lucky, 11! -Don't look, help me. -Sure. -My name's Paolo. -I'm Susan. -Creamy Susan? -What? -I meant it as a joke, nut it's a bullshit. -A bullshit? -Yes, a nonsense. -Are you Italian? -No, I'm from Naples. -Then you can make a pizza out of that sandwich. -A pizza? -Shall we do waterski? -We should be back at one pm. -Stop it! -11. -Felicino, I'm winning! -Athletes, are you ready? -Go! -Let's go. -Be careful, we'll smash everything. -Naples' guru has spoken. -Go! -I go. Look, the marquis looks like Ester Williams. Go! -Luca, what happened? -Everything melted! Shit! -You broke it. -I told you, we'd break it. I told you, you bring bad luck! Now "daddy", we'll smash your butt! Instead of being back at one, they were back at sunset. The skate dragged the broken boat. Morino and the parents are waiting for them. -Dad, it was not my fault. -Wasn't it? Silly! Don't get out of your room for the next three days! Go! -Why are you laughing? -I swear, it was not my fault. -Go home, we'll talk later! -Bye, Gianni. Cretins. Scoundrels. Miss Marquis, take them back in your picture, the Louvre is closing. -When your father will know that, he kills you! -It was Luca's fault. Don't bother, tomorrow we'll change the pistons. -I would change your ears! -Are you nuts? Leave me! Cretins, you want my death! -I'm feeling sick! -Mum, stop it, this is not a play! -After what you've done, just shut up! -But the boat is broken. -You shut up! And you shut up! -Let's go. -Everybody shut up! I can't stand this anymore! I'll catch you! -I'm sorry if I gave you troubles! -They are a trouble! -So, that's your mother. -Yes. -And I bet your name is not Barbara. -My name is Marina. -Not mine. My name is Luca. -Hi, Luca. -Hi, Marina. Even the marquis told you that was a stupid thing to do. Stupid?! If I'm lucky I'll have a great summer. Felicino, finally you are here. -London-Milan in 36 hours. -Did you learn to drive? Cucumber head! I changed my car. The Fulvia Coup? is great. The steering wheel is a compass. Look! Women are all bitches. -As soon as you turn away they... -Zac! -What? Come here. What are you doing? -Don't you want to dance? -I don't like you to dance like that. -But in London you liked it. -There I liked and here I don't. -But I just wanted to... -The show is over! Brother! Lots of people tonight, looks like a beauty show. Good for you if you are enjoying. I would just like to watch TV, then "bang" my woman and then get a good sleep. -You don't know what poetry is. -And you don't know what a "cunt" is. We also don't know what money is. We can just afford a softdrink. Sit down, I can treat you. Your pen is treating us. You sign and at the end of summer daddy will pay. -Can I order spirits? -Just drink whatever you want. -Let's call the waiter, then. -Good. The old ladies are more attractive than the girls. Look at that blond. She's the tiger of the mattress. She's got an angelface, but deep inside... Hemingway, would you screw that lady? No, married women have too many problems! She's coming toward me. Maybe I've attracted her. -Gianni! -Mrs. Balestra. -Do you remember Gianni? -Yes I do, he beat me at ramino. -We can play a return match. -No, let's do this. You can have a dance with my wife, I'll drink a bourbon in the meanwhile. -Could you take this please? -Sure. -Let's go. -I can't dance. -Come on! # O mio Signore, in questo mondo io non ho avuto tanto. # What are you looking at? Are you ashamed to dance with me in presence of your friends? Not at all! I don't like very much dancing. -Does your mother know you are here? -No, not even my girlfriend knows it. -What would she say, if she knew? -She's not going to know. -Liar! And clumsy too. You're right, dancing is not funny. Thanks and goodbye. -Who is that woman? -No one... One of my mother's friends. No one... One of his mother's friends. -If my mum had such friends I would never go out. -Exactly! Are you smoking? If dad knows it, he kills you. I don't care at all. Look, wonderful mansion! # Andavo a cento all'ora per veder la bimba mia. # Hi, Marina. Hi, Luca. -What are you doing here? -I accompanied Marina. Otherwise my parents would never allow me. Fine. Come, I'll show you something. Are you her guard-dog? Easy, I won't eat her... I'll tear her in pieces! SONG: "Come te non c'? nessuno". -Don't be silly. -You wanted to learn "the tile dance". -You're holding me too tight. -You've to hold tight in this dance. -I prefer the "surf". -You have 0 technique. This the way you have to do. This is the tile dance. -The tile on the butt! -Wow, how nice of you! Awesome. These parties are so awesome. No, you are a real boar. You forgot that today is our third anniversary. Shall we dance? Look, Gianni turned into Fred Astaire. Cool! Gianni turned into Fred Astaire! That's so cool! That nigger is great! What's his name? Cassius Clay. He won the gold medal in Rome. God! The way he throws! Did you see? -Aren't you dancing? -Fuck you! -How long will it take? -Just leave me alone during the match! Or you can go back on the white cliffs of Dover. Go away, I can't concentrate. I am sick of her! As soon as I saw the directions to "Forte dei Marmi" I got sick of her. Don't laugh, I don't like it. I don't like boxing either. -Have we met before? -Yes, I am Paolo. -Ah, the Sicilian. -No, the Napolitan. Remember the boat? SONG: "Il cielo in una stanza". -Do you like parties? -Is this a party? Nobody looks happy. You look sad too. No, but when I am among people I get shy and I would like to sit in a corner. -It's the way I am. -You must learn to "socialize". -What does it mean? -Socialize, like a bee flying over many flowers. Takes something here, something there... and then she gets better. -Nice song, isn't it? -It is. It's very romantic. You feel like dancing with me, but you are not asking me. -Do you want to dance? -I don't want to stay here. Do you feel like going out? -With who? -With me. I'll be back soon. -Ok, I'll be waiting. -Will you kiss me? -Are you crazy? -I kiss you and if you don't like it, I stop. -Don't be stupid. I'll put my hands behind my back and use only my upper lip. -But we just met a couple of days ago. -Today is the 10th of July, do you think that on the 4th of august we can start using tongues? -First I want to be sure. -I've not eaten onions for a month. -You're very funny. -You're very beautiful. What will your Milan girlfriend think about this? The same that your Naples boyfriend will think. -He says a lot of bad words. -Then he looks like me. No, you kiss much better. Susan. Where are you? You are very annoying, still, you are beautiful. -Come here. -Leave me in peace. Let's see if you like this better than boxing. Ooh! -Are you done? -I am, in five minutes there is on TV track and fields events. I can't miss them. Paolo, where are you going? Don't bother him. We're on holiday, let's enjoy. # Twist, twist, tutto il mondo. # Gino, get some champagne and caviar. The commander is jealous of his caviar. Are you from daddy's side? We're not beggars! It's just caviar! Next winter we'll cut the workers' salary! -Why fathers are such assholes? -Because they have stupid sons like you! -Dad... -What's going on? -It's Luca's fault, not mine. -"Brave captains"! -As soon as I go out, you trick me. It's a surprise party. Twist! # A Saint Tropez... # -Who are all these beggars? -Beggars! Hey! The best people are here. May I introduce you marquises Pucci, blue-blooded, like a blue sky. -Cook! -Enough! Everybody out of here! Get out! Guys, I'm sorry. Music is over, friends go away. -Hi, Marina. -Gianni, a call for you. It's a woman. I am sure it's my mother. What have I done to deserve this? -Hallo? Who's speaking? -Don't you recognize me? It's me. The one that in your letter you call a great woman. I am not offended. Women like to receive such kind compliments. After all, I am really great. I am not joking. What you say is true. I often feel alone and I like to talk to somebody. I am at a party. We're dancing, having fun. It's a nice party. Last night at Capannina I desired to hold you tight. It was tenderness, nothing sexual. I didn't say you are maniacal, I said it wasn't sexual. -Shall we meet again? -Tomorrow? Fine. Tomorrow. -See you tomorrow, then. -Bye. Gianni! Where shall we meet? -My place? -Fine. -Mrs. Balestra. -What are you doing there? -I don't want to give you trouble. -What? If your husband sees us, he might become suspicious. You said he has a bad temper. My husband is here only during week-ends. -Typical! -Come in. -What are you reading? -Hemingway, I followed your advice. To be true I advised you Fitzgerald... This is Fitzgerald. -Is he? -Yes. -I always mix up foreign authors. -I could give you some free classes. -I do really need it, don't? -Well... I have something to tell you, but I feel a bit ashamed. I don't know you very much and I am older than you. Age is just a personal data. -I want to show you something. -I am really curious to see it. -But you don't know what it is. -I think I do know. -Really? -Come into my room. -As you want, madam -Don't be so formal. -As you want, Mrs. Balestra. Nobody ever read these. I wrote them when I was younger. Gianni! -What are you doing in my bed? -Aren't you going you show me something? Yes, my poems. Ah, your poems! Great. -I wanted to listen comfortable. -What the hell where you thinking? Nothing, I swear. Look, I am still dressed. That's crazy! I could be your mother! I just wanted you to read my poems and you sneak into my bed! I just wanted to listen, I had understood. Sit down. -Are you nervous, aren't you? -Shall I say the truth? I am. And... are you nervous? Shall I say the truth? I am not. "When the moon replaces the sun, when the star shines in the sky, hope turns off in my eyes and in my heart the dark turns on." Nice. Very delicate. Feminine. It's very old stuff. You can see a young melancholy. -This is my favorite. Can I read it. -It's why I am here. -The title is "My cat and I". -Interesting. -If you don't like it, just say it. -I will be pitiless. "My cat and I keep each other company, and when the sunset makes us nostalgic, just a stroke and a meow, and night falls soon over the hill side." -Nice, isn't it? -Great. Absolutely great. On boring summer days, we had a bike trip. Everybody was happy. Paolo was the happiest of all. Felicino decided not to come and Susan was ready to socialize. -Selvaggia, where's Gianni? -He had to go somewhere with his parents. -Is Gianni pissed off if I court you? -No, I get pissed off! -Your mind is full of prejudices. -And yours is full of bullshits. How poetic! Did you go to a private school? -Take away that hand! -Do you fear to get tanned? Take it away! -How can you like it if I don't want to? -I didn't say I like it. -Why are you doing it, then? -I just saw somebody doing it. -Who? -Everybody, even actors. -This is not a stage. -I am not an actor either. -But... -But what? Maybe I like it too. Do you want the truth? I like it very much. Lover, picking flowers for your woman? -"While the cat's away the mice can play". -Cool! -Are you jealous of Felicino? -No, you are his girlfriend! Yes, when he's around. When he's not, I am alone. -Why don't you kiss me? -Right, why don't I kiss you? Well? Oh, my God! # ? la pioggia che va...! # Great cycling news. After the last enthralling stop Felice Gimondi won the "Tour de France". It's soaking wet! Give me the blanket. At the end of August usual election of Miss Versilia. That summer Susan won the title of little queen of the beach. -Come on, hug her. -But she's my girlfriend! You're really beautiful. SONG: "Una rotonda sul mare". -Have you seen Susan? -Yes, Cecco is taking pictures of her. He's making... a photo session. A photo session! Cool! Susan! Susan, where're you? Susan! Do you want to become like Francoise Sagan? -I don't know! -Fine. Honey, get off, it's too hot! On winter is cold, on summer is hot, the rest of the time you are tired. -How annoying! -I just need to relax. But I want to talk to you. Talk? It's sleeping time. What do we need to talk about? We've been talking all our life! Yes, about the kid's tonsils, about holidays, about housemaids and about your cars. Once we used to talk in the car. -Do you remember that time in Cortina? -Yes, it was very cold. Is it the only thing you remember? No, I can't remember if I had an Alfa 1900 or the Aurelia Spider. -Can you remember? -It was a Porsche. Exactly, a very sexy car. You're right, nice time! What are you thinking about? I might buy another Porsche. I would have a relaxing trip and be here soon. Good, so we have half-hour more to talk. Good night. The guys often went to a place full of the "locals". There was Gualtiero, who after a little part in "Il sorpasso" was hoping to "smash in" the movies world. There was Dadi, fond of motorbikes and foreign women and there was Dante, fond of politics. SONG: "Guarda come dondolo". Guys, did you see that? -Devil is in her body! -I would know how to take it away! -You talk too much and do nothing. -He's right. Really? I'll show you. Good, keep the flag flying! Gualtiero, what are you doing? -Leave me alone! -First you provoke me and then reject me? -I won't let you go. -Leave me alone! Tomorrow I'll go to Bepy, in Corsica. We'll have so much fun! -And Susan? -She stays here. I don't want a burden to carry along. -What is the burden doing? -Native, what are you doing? If you want to have fun, go to Livornow's harbor, there're so many bitches good for you. You came from Milan to try to fool us! Go back to your pig mother, or I break your legs. Don't mention my mother, you don't even know your own! What a luck, a nice photo session! Beat him! Don't piss me off, or I beat him! I'll tear him apart! Be careful, my brother is an animal. Blood! Since 10 years you come here to make a mess. Enough! I don't want any violence. Let's talk. -Damn, did you see? -Put her up. I can talk to an antiquarian, he might pay you 250 liras. -Your Vespa is a wreck. -Yours is a piece of junk! What? I fixed it, it's great. I can show you which one is great. Let's have a race. The loser can't come here for the rest of the season. -Agree? -Agree. Alt! -Beat him! -Nobody can beat my monster! Luca, stop it, we can go to another cafe'. It's too late. Don't worry, I am on a bed of roses. Go around the pine-wood and back. That's not fair, my capacity is 125, yours is 150. Don't be fussy! It's 25 cubic cm. apart. Listen, mate. I'll bring a passenger. Ok? -Ok. -Who's coming with me? -We can't, we're two. -I'm coming. -No, it's dangerous. -It's dangerous for me. -I'll hold on tight. -Wish him good luck, so the engine turns off. Ready, guys? Go! -Ouch, my leg! -Naples is broken. -Are you quitting? -Screw it, stupid! Where is it? God! How did you fall? He wished himself bad luck. I got distracted. -I bet you were going too fast. -No, we were going... 30 km per hour. Maybe 35. -Did you fall at 30 km per hour? -Our son is so stupid. -It can happen. -Yes, to stupid people. -Doctor, is it serious? -No, it isn't I told you it was dangerous. -I looked so stupid. -Does it hurt? No, if you are here. -Can we keep quiet? -Yes, it's not serious. -Thanks. Do you think our son and the stranger ... are doing those kind of things? If he is like his dad, they do things, big things! -Everything. -Casanova words! Come on! For my fault his holidays are over. At least he'll pass the exams. The cast touches the teachers. Shall I meet you here, tonight? No, I stay with Paolo in case he needs something. I'd go crazy without you. I'll smash my head on the wall so they'll keep me here. I am not running away. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow. "Tomorrow is another day, we'll see". It's better to call it calendar year... -What a fucking day. -Felicino called from Corsica. -What did he say? -Nothing. You know him. -Feel like smoking? -What is it? We call it "pot". It makes you feel good. -You take drugs! -Do I look a drug addict? No, but they say this thing kills you. -Have you never smoked? -No, but I heard about it. -Is it true it makes you throw up? -No, you take trips to fantastic places. You feel like flying. -Like Modugno? -No. -Like in Donovan's song? -More or less. -Do you have a pipe? -Yes, my father's one. -Be careful. -This is fine. What if prof Cutolo sees us? Professor, we're taking drugs! My god! Isn't it dangerous? Wow! Did it already "catch you"? -I feel nothing. -Close your eyes and let go. Susan... Can you hear me? I can't. -Then I can tell you. -I said I can't hear you. -Can you hear me now? -No, I can't. -Then I can go on. -What are you doing? I'm smoking. It's catching me! I can see Donovan, Modugno, I can see prof Cutolo, everything! I can see... God, those balls! -Hallo? -Hi Luca, it's me. How're you? Hi Marina. I'm so bored! I was with prof Cutolo. If father Mariano joins us, I'll go to bed. How's Paolo? Fine, he's sleeping. He always talks about Susan. Is she there? Susan? Let me take look. Susan! -Hallo, Marina? -Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Paolo. My brother is shy and he does not have the courage to say things. -But he loves you very much. -I love him too. -Eh! Ok, tomorrow I'll come to the hospital. Bye. -Shall we do it again? -Come on! "Coitus interruptus". I told you this was going to be a bad day! All going bad. Next thing is my father surprises us. Oh, God! Get dressed, quick! -What are you doing? -Nothing! I told you not to use my pipe! I am sorry. Are you smoking? You know mum doesn't want to. Caino, wasn't your brother "fucking" her? -So it is still a family business. -If you are happy with it...! If the pot will catch him, mum will have fun tonight. Since Gianni had fallen in love with Adriana, he always stayed home waiting for a possible telephone call from her. -Gianni, why don't you go out? -I don't feel to. You stay always home, we could have stayed in the city. -Any problems with Selvaggia? -Let me read. -Are you in love with somebody else? -How annoying! I don't like to see you lying on that sofa, like a pillow! Do you prefer I hang up to the ceiling like a lamp? It's for me! -Hallo? -This is Adriana. Let's meet inside the beach hut. -You believed it! -You'd like to have sex in a beach hut! None of your business! Why don't you tell us what you and Lady Chatterley are doing! For the Casanova of Genova ... Hip, hip... -Hi. -Hi. -Can you talk for a moment? -I'm in a hurry. -Are you running to her? What did I do? -Nothing. -Gianni! You really like her? She could be your mother. -Shut up! -Tell me, If I did something wrong. -You did nothing. I thought you loved me. -Last winter you wrote to me so many love letters. -Now it's different. You're not mature enough for me. Bye, Gianni. Morino, help me, somebody is drowning! Coming! Hold her! Morino, here she is! If I catch you, I kill you! -Play, match, game. -For you! -Do you think this is Wimbledon? -Learn the game! Eat a sandwich with the Davis "Cup"! -Sorry for the joke yesterday. -I am not angry. A sentimental relationship must be respected. Sentimental!? The relationship is sexual. -You and that woman... -Are you surprised? -She looks an honest woman. -Infact, she's treating me honestly! -Don't be mysterious, tell me. -She's consuming me. -She's one of those who does... everything? -Everything. -She likes it? -When you touch her, she starts shaking. I never met a woman like that before. If you tickle her shoulder she cries. When we are in bed she talks like that...! What does she say? -She's a pig, then. -Yes, she's a pig. I think I saw you on the beach with Gianni. I am a good friend of, I 'm his best friend. We talk about everything. He told me to come here. -Am I disturbing? -No, sit down. Some ice tea? -Thanks. Gianni is right, you are great. No, I am a normal bourgeois wife on holiday. -His your husband at home? -No, he's almost never here. -Interesting. -I think it's depressing. Points of view. Is Gianni saying I am a sensitive woman? No, very sensitive! How silly! Gianni and I have no secrets. -I know everything about your shoulder. -What do you know? I know! But don't worry, I won't tell anyone. -What are you talking about? -I know what the situation is, I already had a couple of relationships with married women. -Can you feel it? -No. -You feel nothing? -No. -Not even a little tickling? -No. You should cry, at this point. Do you want me to cry? If you cry, I get excited. And if you tell me the same things you tell Gianni... that would be great! I will tell you, sure. Idiot, stupid. Are you slapping me? Gianni didn't tell me about that. He told you I am a sensitive woman, and what else? He said that you... you are a pig. -What...! -Pig! You and that stupid pig! -I'll show him! -Adriana! -I brought you the novels. -This is the Marquis De Sade. Come here, I want to talk to you. -What's going on? -Out of my sight, you both! -What are you doing here? -I came to show how stupid I am! -Did you tell her what I said yesterday? -I did. -And what did she said? -This is what. Now listen to me. Idiot! I am a soldier, not a murderer. What is the life of 200 people compared to the Reich Victory? -They're like flies. -I don't kill flies. I will never give an order to shoot. Colonel, I have the power. Shove it into your ass! -May I hug you? -If you want. -If you ever try to kiss me... -What will you do? I'll let you kiss me. -I missed you so much. -I did too. -Paolo, how are you? -Better, thank you. As soon as I leave you alone, you get into trouble! The cast gives you a nice look. -What about the cruise? -Very nice! Full of cool women. Pleasant. -What is this? -Stop it, my mother is here. -Let's go into your room. -Are you crazy? Yes. # A very crazy heart. # Wait. I'll get something, be back soon. -What did you write? -"I love you so much". When you're back in Africa, you'll say it was a blond with two big boops. A blond like Susan. I bet you'll tell your friends about her. -Luca! How did you get here? -From the terrace. -You are so crazy. -Yes, I am crazy about you. Marina, open. -My mother! -We're in trouble. No! There. Marina, we have to talk. You like that boy from Milan, don't you? -Any problems? -No, on the contrary. I asked around, his family is very rich. -He's a lot of money. -I don't care about money. I'd love Luca even if he were the baker's assistant. I know, but with money it's better. We'd be very happy if you marry him. His mother looks like the Madonna of Pompei, she wears a lot of jewels. -She's beautiful. -Mum, stop it. You have our approval. Don't lose him. It won't happen again. Give me a kiss. If you are such a nice girl, I take some credits too. -What's up? -My mother spoils always everything. Nothing really happened. Come here to your baker's assistant. SONG: "Una carezza in un pugno". -What are you doing? -Nothing. I want to make love with you. No, please, I've never done it. Soon or later you'll do that. Your mother did it too. I know, but sometimes I want and sometimes I don't. Let's do it now. -I don't know if I can do it. -Sure you can. It's natural. What if I get pregnant? You won't, I have the coil. -Happy birthday, my dear. -Thanks. -Happy birthday. -Thanks. -Why is she here? -Who? You know, your mistress. Ah, Adriana! My parents invited her. Her husband is here too. -I don't want her at my birthday. -I could not avoid it. -Maybe you invited her. -Don't be silly. We should not get together again, you like mature women. -That's not true. -Why is she her, then? -Because I wanted to meet you. -I don't. Were you fighting because of me? -No! -Yes. Gianni is still crazy about you. -Big words! Crazy about me! -That's not true. I believe it. -But she doesn't. -You can't explain these things. Gianni has not fault. Do you believe me? At my age, these things can happen. A woman gets bored and tries to catch a younger man. I "teased" Gianni and he didn't have the courage to refuse me. But he loves you. It's humiliating for me, not for you. Getting old is really bad. You wanted to give me a kiss. My best wishes. Here's Adriana. -Where were you? -I was chatting with the guys. -Bye Adriana, thanks. -Bye. -She's cute. -She's a "bomb"! If I were younger...! But I am stuck. I'm joking! This is Paolo. May I talk to Susan? She left, she went back to her village! I brought her to the station. I feel so free! She didn't want to go away anymore. She ate, slept and got gifts! But I was tired of her, so she realized she had to go. Was she thinking to get married? I will never get trapped. Agree? Hallo? Paolino? Hallo? Paolino? Susan, don't leave! Wait, Susan! Susan! If you want to follow the train, take off the cast, first. -Susan was on that train. -I saw her. -She told me to give you this. -Who? -Susan. -Why she gave it to you? -Are you jealous? -I came to give her some pics. -Sorry. -That's ok. "Dear Paolo, I'm packing, but I want to say goodbye to you. You're the best friend I ever met in Italy. When you're back to Naples say hi to the Vesuvio and "O' sole mio". Soon I'll say hi to them too and maybe we'll kiss. This is my address. A big "kiss". Susan." Summer was over. Big rainy clouds were on the way and the sharp smell of the pine trees were turning into cold wind blows. -I am so wet! -What about Portofino? -It was fun. -Hi, Luca. -Careful. -What's up? -Nothing... -What's going on? -Will you get angry If I tell you something? -It depends. I am leaving this afternoon. You told me you would leave on Sunday. I know, but... Veronica is here. We'll go to the countryside. My parents want to meet her. Is she that cute girl? Yes. She has some make up, nothing special... -Who's she? -Remember my friend from Milan? -Your girlfriend? -Yes, but once in Milan, I... -Will you write to me? -Sure. -I won't. -Why not? -No reason. -Luca, let's go, it's late. -Ok. -You must be Veronica. I am Marina. -Hi. Are you crying? No, it's the rain. We should go. Bye. -Bye, Marina. -Goodbye, Luca. After 18 years, Forte dei Marmi is always there, the Capannina is just the same, happy and arrogant. -Paolo! Susan! -Look, Cecco! -My god, Cecco! -How many years! -Susan and I got married. -We remember you loved each other. -We're happy. -If you had not given that letter... -But I did. -Why did you disappear? -When you're young you do crazy things. I bet you're not married, you're not that kind of man. But I am. She's German, we met 5 years ago. We don't talk much because of the language, but in bed... she's such a pig! -I still have Susan pics you gave me. -I have them too. Nothing changed here, like in the '60. People changed. No, we changed. We don't go out much at night. Many years ago it was different. -Good evening. -They are Felicino and Luca. -Where? -There. -Look at Felicino! Hey, sweetie! Excuse me. Have you seen my brother? He's fat, but he's still an attractive man. -Mind if I say hello to some friends? -Sure, go on, but in 10 minutes we are leaving. -You can come too. -I would not know what to say. -Hi, Luca. -Hi. -Don't you remember me? Sure! You look nice. -You look nice too. -When did you arrive? I am leaving tonight, we go to Spain. -Great! -I prefer Corsica. I have to go, my husband is waiting. It was nice to meet you again. Yes, it was. -Hi, Luca. Hi, Felicino. -Hi, sweety. -Who's she? -Marina, the one with the stupid brother. -The one who brought bad luck? -That one. -Marina! -Is she a friend of yours? He "fucked her" 20 years ago. Same old romantic. Selvaggia comes here too. She's not with Gianni. She's married and divorced and now living together with a car dealer from Pistoia. Gianni comes here sometimes, he's a journalist. He's not married. He says he never met the right woman. Adriana keeps on going out with men younger than her. Feel ashamed dancing with an old woman? No, I like slow dances. At my age they were really cool. Because you could get a more human contact. Mum, you're great! And you can't dance. Mum, what about when you were young? -I don't know... it was different. -What do you mean? I can't tell... our hearts were beating. Yes, I think I remember that our hearts were beating. This is for you, miss. "This message sums up all the letters I never wrote to you. You're always the most beautiful. Luca."
