Where are you going now? After I wake up, I'm going to train. How often do you drive? Of course, nearly every day. Because I have to go to work and I have to go home. Sometimes if my car is at the club, then one of my friends will pick me up, as most of the players live close to me. Harry Kane is two minutes away. Really close. So sometimes I ask them, but most of it I drive myself. So do you like my driving? Oh, you're a great driver! Not so much. Just wondering whether you're comfortable or not. I'm really comfortable right now. Even though I'll arrive at 9:00am, the training doesn't start until 10:30. Since there's still plenty of time, I will have breakfast. Now I'm hungry as I didn't have any. I will have a breakfast and get ready before I start. Here we are now. Harry Kane is very passionate and he also has tonnes of things to learn outside the field. Dele dances by himself when he is excited. He is very innocent, like a child. I love this opportunity, to play with these players. I enjoy it as much as I can. Those opportunities are not given to everyone. Dele, Eriksen, Harry Kane and me seem to be called D.E.S.K as an acronym, four main strikers, the core offence. For now, we've hit it off well. Eriksen, Dele Alli, Harry Kane - we've been playing for almost four years. Now I know what they like and also I know exactly where to go on the field when they position themselves. When the fans came and asked for autographs, my hands would shake. At first, you were nervous, but you are used to it now? It is not about getting used to it. It is rather now what you have to do as a football player. Welcome to my hometown. Have you been here before? No, I've only come here before the construction. This is the first visit, first since the work has been done. How long has it been since you last visited? About three years, maybe more. His first visit in almost three years. Do you have a lot of memories here? Oh, definitely. I grew up here. Ever since he was born, he was a charming boy. Always a smiley face while growing up. Baby Son's favourite toy was always a ball. He kicked a ball around in his room when he turned toddler. All good? Good. Nice to see you. He lived in Germany for a while so he speaks some German. I'm coach Son Heung-Yoon from Son's football academy. I haven't seen him in a long time. How long has it been? I think, last year... We met a few times after international matches. But this is his first time at the academy. We have both been busy. He's got cooler. He's played in the Champions League final. Yeah, but he lost. This is true brotherhood. We're this strict to each other. They only do keepie-uppies all day. Yeah, you get tired... So they always look at me to see if they'll be doing something else today. It was like that for us too. If they get dribbling or passing drills, they get really excited. No keepie-uppies is like a day off. We trained about four times more than they're doing. They train indoors when it's hot. And they train in the shade in the afternoon. They train in the shade. We trained in the sun. On hard ground! Once, me and my brother, we had a fight over nothing. You know, some brother stuff... Dad got angry. He brought two balls and made us do keepie-uppies for four hours without dropping it. You start to hallucinate! We promised not to fight again but that didn't last long. Me and Heung-min had different ways of dealing with dad. I'm more like our father. So I had more attitude and would get punished for it. But Heung-min was cheekier. He acted like he's hurt before dad punished him. He would roll on the ground before dad hit him. So I got scolded a lot more. Hey. Having fun? Is it tough? Which grade are you guys in? All in the fifth? So this is elementary squad. You guys nervous? -Is it surprising? -It's weird. Weird? Do I look weird? No, I feel weird! You feel weird? Feels like a dream. What's so dreamy? I'm like you guys. You guys want to take a picture with Son? How do you concentrate better? Concentration? How do you concentrate better... How would you... You get told off a lot, right? -Because you lack concentration? -Yeah. You need to concentrate to not get called out. Concentrate to not get scolded. You learn as you get scolded. Understand? How long did you train for when you were growing up in Chuncheon? How long did I train for? Yeah, when you were young. I did the same as you guys. But I got scolded even more. This way to the side! Show your sole to the next person. That's it! The foot should be up this way. Leave the hands. Strength. They need to master the basics to become a football player. So they must train repetitively until they master the skills. I think the fundamentals are important for anything. You need to master the basics to move on to the next stage. You want to move on without doing so? That's nonsense. Fundamentals need to be mastered, and players who've done it will grow further. They have higher potential to achieve success, I believe. My approach was a regime that makes you comfortable on the ball. For young kids, this needs to be a priority, and it's the most important thing, anyway. So we did a regime that involves ball control for two hours. Sonny did this for about six years. I was a typical kid who liked football but hated to study. How much did you like football? I really loved football since I was a kid. This is where Sonny started playing football until he graduated. Until he graduated from this primary. He only wanted to play football when he wasn't eating. "Physical movement is excellent and loves football". One day, young Sonny told me he wanted to be a football player. But former footballers mostly don't want their children to become players. Because we know how difficult it is. Parents want their kids to have a comfortable life. He was so firm about it so I asked twice. But he was very young, what did he know? Sonny just loved football. It must have been hard raising your kid to be a footballer? Right. As a parent, if your kids want to do the same as you used to do, something you weren't as good at, and you teach them how, you really have to be thorough. It's hard ground here. It was the same back then as well. Every year from October to December, I put a hundred bags of salt on the ground. More than a hundred bags of salt over this ground. -A bag of salt? -A bag of salt. I hung a bag of salt on a small truck, drove around the field. With salt on the ground, snow melts quicker in winter. When summer comes, it gets really dry here. But that salty ground stays quite fluffy so you won't injure yourself as much when you trip over. And here you see where the pull-up bars are now. When it would snow, I'd come out early in the morning and sweep at least a ten metre radius area to make a space for Sonny to train even by himself at any time, even in the snow right here. Never skipped a training session. Not a day. 365 days. What kind of training did you do with your father? Honestly, a lot of really intense things. For example... running keepie-uppies, three laps around the field. One lap with your left leg and one with your right. And another with both feet. This was really tough. Because it isn't about pace. It requires a real technique. If I ever drop the ball while running, even on the second lap, I'd have to start over from the first lap. Now we have a nice grass pitch but there are memories left on the school field. When my kids did an around-the-cone dribble, I drew on the ground as if with a compass. You draw like this and you have a circle. But this is too small, so I would do another pass. And then you do another one here. You draw here then you make them touch, like this. Now you have figure eight. I drew this so many times so I could see my sock through the hole on the tip of my shoes. He couldn't stand to wait. He couldn't spank us on the bottom because he wouldn't wait for us to bend over. We would have 10-20 balls on the ground at training. He kicked them towards us as if he were shooting. Once, an old lady who was passing by tried to call the police because we were being brutally scolded. While training, father always gave us a demo. But he's a human. He makes mistakes as well. He was dribbling and made a mistake. And being young, I told my brother, "Dad is so lucky," and my brother asked, "Why?" "He doesn't get scolded when he makes mistakes." I still remember saying something like that. That's how much I was afraid of my dad. I was so frightened to make a mistake, I remember saying that during the training. Turn around and keep your head up! Focus! Naturally, kids would lose focus, then I would... People thought I was his step-father because I was so harsh on Sonny. There was a a study-abroad programme at the Korean Football Association. Our family had a difficult financial situation at the time. But I wanted to go abroad. So we prepared really hard for that programme. German scouts came to observe youth players. It was a programme where scouts came from Nurnberg FC, Hamburger SV, to pick three players each - total six players. I was confident because I was good in training. I was confident of going to Germany. Luckily, I was selected to go to Germany. On the first day, I thought what if I can't get the contract here? Because my dad told me before I left, you got to the place you've dreamt of. The professional world. It took over my head. My parents invested so much time in me. Wouldn't they be disappointed if I didn't get the contract? That's all I thought of. That was the first time he was in the spotlight. The light was shed on young Sonny, who nobody heard of before. Everyone was surprised. He broke his foot shortly after. What concerned me the most was due to the injury, he might lose the opportunity to adapt and develop as a professional player, reminding him of the lesson to thoroughly prepare for what comes ahead. Son's return after a three-month gap from injury, Bundesliga debut, when the ball was played in, Son made his run. Son saw the goalkeeper coming off his line, lifted the ball with his right foot, lobbed the goalkeeper and tapped the ball into the empty net. That amazing move from an 18-year-old boy surprised the German media. They said he'd be a leading player in Hamburg. He's likeable and a very good player. He's good at long shots and he can score goals. And also a good dribbler. I remember a game against Dortmund when he scored a beautiful goal. We won it 4-1, I think, and he scored two or three goals. I remember it quite vividly. Those were good times. He played his part in his team winning. He always tries to improve and is often dissatisfied with himself and that is a great character trait. He came back from the Asian Cup having gained 4kg. Most matches were played at night, and I didn't get much game time. It was late when we came home. Those who played ate to recover. But I didn't know that and ate too much. They talk behind him saying, "He's done." The season was over and we had come back to Korea. But I told Sonny, "I'm not coming. I feel ashamed to go back to Korea. I'm embarrassed." Dad told me he's too embarrassed to go back. I told him I wanted to go back to Korea. "I'll do everything you tell me to do. If you tell me to train three times a day, I will." Because I really wanted to go back home. I was young. It was deadly, almost three sessions a day. I would wake up in the morning, lift weights and then go to the training centre, make 1,000 shots, have lunch, take some rest and go back out in the afternoon. Train with the kids dad was teaching. I sent him back to Germany after not giving him a day of rest during the break. But they didn't recognise Sonny. Because he lost so much weight. He had no fat on his cheeks. That was when I had the Champions League in mind already. So when I was making a move, I chose a team that qualified for the Champions League. For the past 40 years in the Bundesliga, I've never seen any player who could shoot as well as Sonny with both feet. That's part of the reason why we scouted him. I'm the one who has to do my best at the stadium and needs to pour everything out at the stadium, and even if it sounds boring, I try to stay at home. Not much to do being alone here. I fully concentrate for ten months a year, and when I am on holidays outside the season I go easy, relaxed. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When I am in Germany, the first step is to learn German to let the Germans recognise me. I have to be able to speak in English when I am in England. Learning the language of the country means to respect their culture, people, country. It also seems important to show that I'm learning. I thought so and felt it important, especially living in Germany. Living in the camp with people from all around the world, that was hard at first, honestly. I can be a bit harsh on myself. "Oh, I must survive here," bearing this in my mind. I told myself, "Hang in there," chewing my bread every morning. We believed in him, in his big talent and he's made phenomenal progress since then. During his last year at Leverkusen, he got several offers from top clubs, in the Premier League and Tottenham. The physical factor seems more required here than in Germany, so I feel [the Premier League] is way harder. Money is an advantage to recruit better players especially in the Premier League. That means intense competition follows within the team. If you are not well prepared, the league could be more physically and mentally tough than expected. Father was a strict teacher. He would punish me or yell at me if I've done wrong. But now I'm thinking back and have to admit that that strictness had a strong influence on me. If you lower your head, you can't figure out the situation around you. Can't sense attack patterns, speed, etc, can't follow up. This became a habit of mine since I was a kid. Even now during training with other players. I automatically turn my head and look. And I've kept doing this. Pochettino seemed impressed with that. I should kick the ball into Dad's hands because that makes it easy to throw back to me, otherwise he has to bend to pick the ball up. I was paying quite good attention to this. Once, it was the team's rehab training day. I did the ball lifting drill for about 20 minutes, which was what I used to do always. A few players were still around there, chatting with other after their training session. They started watching me doing that drill all the way for 20 minutes. They left when I left. All the mates there clapped me. Should put the ball onto your instep. It takes about 40 minutes to finish. And if you drop the ball there, if the ball drops to the ground before 40 minutes are done, then the fierce scolding would be started. That is how I've trained him. Last! One more! Last! The fact that I was able to teach my son by myself, with my own hands not with others, I feel really happy and lucky for that. I feel really happy and lucky for that. I am still so sorry for the children. I often cry alone in my heart. I must help him to focus on kicking the balls. Back from training, let him have his own space to relax in. But he shouldn't have to do such management himself. It's just nonsense. What is your father to you? Always, my answer is the same for this whenever, wherever. He is my soccer senior, soccer friend, soccer teacher. A really good father and the one whose everything is perfect for me. I've watched football matches many times. But definitely I feel the passion heating up in the stadium. The weather is cold, but the atmosphere on the site is hot, I feel. I am very excited to watch Son play in the UK for the first time. It was touching how many British fans in the stadium gave a thumbs up once they recognised the Koreans. Even outside the stadium after the game, they continued to give us compliments. Oh, this "Son Heung-min effect" is just amazing. How have you been? Are you well? You're just awesome. Been a while. I rely on him all the time. Whatever I do, he is the one who has my back. He is like my big brother I can learn a lot from. I saved Heung-min's number in my mobile under the name "Son-Shine". When I get good news that he wins the game or scores a goal, that makes my day. Good mood all day long. Just couldn't think of anything else but sunshine, "Son-Shine". I believe he is sunshine to many of us. I am so glad you came. Is that so? I saw a few players running on the pitch even after the game. Those who didn't get to play much in the match today. Was it like some sort of supplementary training? Yes, like a post-game training. I did it a lot in the first season right after I joined Tottenham. Because I didn't get many chances to play. That is really tough. Is that right? It's tough to stay mentally focused when you missed playing. And that post-game training is more intense than your expectation. Not playing in the matches must have an impact. Right? In a more psychological way. Of course it does. I have been there. I've done that as well. Mentally, it is really tough to deal with. But you just have to pull through. It is inevitable for any players. So we have to go over it. Like I said, for those who work hard, the opportunity comes around. Even if I didn't get to play on the pitch, I did give everything in training. I wanted to play on the pitch. Wanted it so badly. You always manage yourself well enough to be in the starting line-up. I never take it for granted. I just try hard. That's all. If you stay here long enough... can't help dreaming about delicious food back in Korea. Oh, full of tasty choices in Korea. What do you normally have when you travel back? I am craving BunSik. I love them too. Tteokbokki is the best when watching football, your match. Tteokbokki with a glass of chilled beer and watch your game. Tteokbokki and Bibim Mandu as night snacks. Jjolmyeon and Bibim Mandu. But you know, I don't even think of night snacking here. I go to bed too early in fact. You go to bed at ten. You go to bed at ten? Yes, to bed early but when I am back in Korea, I can see myself ending up staying up a little later than usual. Hate to waste time even a minute here. How pitiful. I stay up late, I even try to do that when I am in Korea. And wake up early naturally. I stay up as late as possible. How long do you normally stay in Korea after the season? It depends on the circumstances, usually about six weeks. -Six weeks? -Four to six weeks. It's for quite some time then? I didn't even remember how I played today's match. Today? You did great. It is just another day passing by. I often feel empty. Especially after the match. I think I know what you mean by that. Right after the match, on the same day. There is emptiness coming in. Yes. I feel so empty. I know what it is. Maybe a different kind of emptiness. I definitely know the emptiness you feel. You were surrounded by shouts of crowds. -When I get home... -It is total silence. When I am back home and lie down... I try to sleep... by putting myself down to bed. My body feels so tired. People might wonder, "How can he not sleep? He must be exhausted after the game." The first goal in the new stadium probably will be talked over for the next 100 years. I think it's such an honour to be able to play in such a stadium, and I also think it's been a great day to set up such a wonderful record. My hope is to do better than the previous season. So I wish I can perform better this season again than the last season. Sonny is an inspiration to many people at the moment so I can say he will be remembered for a long time. Son Heung-min, my brother, you are already Mexican. Here in Mexico, many football fans call him "Son-Naldo"! Referring to a mash-up of Son's name with that of Ronaldo because he is a player who really shows his ability when his team most needs him and he really stands out for the team. I think the example Son sets of excelling when someone needs you is something we can all learn from. I think Son Heung-min is the coolest player from Korea. I think Son Heung-min is the best player in Asia. He is a great football player. He has surpassed the Asian standard. I think he has physical condition, technique, sharpness and mentality that has never been seen before from Asian players. He can play in any league in the world. I have no doubt. I played nine years in Europe and I can't break the remaining prejudice against Asians. I still feel it completely. When I first went to Germany, life was harder than I thought. Clearly, breaking the prejudice toward an Asian player requires a tremendous amount of a series of effort. In many ways it could take more time than local players. But you have to prove yourself anyway. These are difficult parts. I can only say, by showing what I am good at in the stadium and ignoring their discrimination. My way of facing against racism should be on the field, I think. It is an award ceremony for the teams and players based in London. I've been nominated to be honoured. I am dressing up for this meaningful event. It would be better if I won the award, but taking part is worthwhile either way. I feel a little nervous tonight. I'd feel a lot less nervous at the match in the stadium. This is a house that brought a lot to me. Since I moved in here, I started playing the game in the team and I got good results. Definitely this home brought me so much luck. So while I am organising to move out, even at this moment I am getting a bit emotional. I have bittersweet, mixed feelings. The reason I decided to move was either for this place or at the new place we will move into soon, the key point to consider is Heung-min's performance. Choose a location close to the training ground and not too much noise for him. Mine is a father's heart that wants his son to focus on soccer. Do you like it, Father? No, I'm going to get rid of all those things. This would be Heung-min's room. Likewise, it will be a minimalist interior. Hello, let me introduce my new home. It's been only a few days since I moved in. As you see, nothing's here, no ornaments. My father likes a space being neat and tidy. He doesn't like leaving things around. This is my dressing room that people expect to see the most. Actually, the wardrobes I ordered didn't arrive yet so please understand my clothes are hung out roughly like this as a temporary measure. I haven't unpacked all of them yet, still lots in the boxes. The reason I like clothes is, honestly, I like to spruce up myself when I go to play. Not that I want to be seen as chic, but I have much interest in fashion. The commuting times are the only chance I get to dress up. I feel good when I see well-organised clothes like this and I get excited when I choose what to wear the next day. This is another of my hobbies. Nowadays, almost all soccer players are well-dressed. It seems that fashion is a part of the soccer player's life. So I think it is necessary to keep up with this theme. This is my bathroom. I don't need to show you this place, do I? I get cleaned here. Really, the reason I moved in here is... this has quite a few great facilities, besides the convenience to my soccer life. Swimming pool, gym, cinema, sauna, etc. This place has choices to relax, this is why I moved in. There are many days the game finishes late and I suffer from insomnia. Then I can go to the swimming pool straight away. That helps me recover. And the gym is not big but very well equipped. I can concentrate entirely on my play and recovery. I'm glad I moved into such a nice house. And this is the end of the show introducing Son Heung-min's house, bye. Everybody forecast City as the winners, and they were saying that City would easily beat us. I had a gut feeling when I scored the second goal. From the first touch I was already planning the next move in my head. The first touch was brilliant, and I dropped the ball exactly where I wanted it to be. The shot was so well struck. If you look at the scene again in slow motion, you will see me running to celebrate as soon as I shot. That is why the goal is more meaningful for me, really. I wouldn't trade it for anything. I couldn't play. I felt so distressed. In fact, not being able to play in the match is the hardest part for a footballer. I kept telling myself to overcome this hardship. My teammates gave their all and I took a rest as I couldn't play. Next game, I'll play harder than the rest of the team. I'll send my positive energy to them for this game. Do you think you can still overcome the score and win? I believe we can do it. Ajax won their away game and we can do likewise. It's important for us players to have faith. Nothing is impossible if you play with "you can do it" spirit. Hello. Where are you heading now? Ahead of game two against Ajax in the Champions League. Got a meeting call from the team so I'm going now. All's well that ends well. I hope we can get some good results for sure. Football is a team sport. I can't build an incredible record by myself, no one can. There were times I've slipped over at the final pivotal step. Or been exposed to physical problems too. The champions are those who overcome all these aspects. We will never give up because this is a chance of a lifetime. Honestly, how many people do you think were expecting us going to the semi-finals or Ajax going there? It was certain that we are a good team. We had no reason to be afraid or feel panic. You can see clearly, it is still a long way to the stadium. Experience of these kinds of big matches to help growth as a better player is what Heung-min and I both wish. From the moment going into the stadium, I saw the trophy. I see the spectators, supporters are cheering half on each side. The pitch is in the finest condition. As I stepped into the stadium... I got chills. How could I put it? I appreciate the huge expectation from people and I hate to lose such a big game. It was very hard to swallow the defeat for myself. I say to him before each match, "Don't be greedy. Empty your mind. Even if the game doesn't go well, it's your favourite, football. You should enjoy, feel happy." I'm still young. I'm not giving up. I'm crossing over the threshold of the grand journey toward higher mountains. I know my fans have been giving me a lot of support and love and that gives me the strength to overcome. I'll work hard to show you how much I've improved. I relieve my stress by playing football. I am a lucky person. I've never regretted playing football for a single day of my life. Football is everything in my life.
