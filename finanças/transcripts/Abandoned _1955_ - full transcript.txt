THE DISBANDED Good morning, young sir ! It's so early ! The countess sent me up. You're going into town, the mayor wants to taIk to you. I'm surprised to see you up so early. Listen, we either accept this situation or we shut up. You're a fine one to taIk. If we'd foIIowed your advice, we'd be six feet under. Very funny. We're going into town, you and CarIo hurry up. - What ? No swim first ? - We'II go to town, then to the river. - They sent for me. - I don't want to go. - What is it ? - A teIegram for Master CarIo. A teIegram for CarIo ? What a day ! < I wanted to get to know him better.> - Is something wrong ? - No, nothing serious. Can't you see he's a hero ? We must Iearn to keep quiet. - What is it ? - Here we go. Evacuees. They must have been sent here after Iast night's bombings. I'm going to pick up the teIegram, see you Iater. Prepare your speech for the mayor. Excuse me. Excuse me. Let the Count through ! Let the SiIIani famiIy through ! We'II see you aII in good time ! Please be patient ! For goodness sake ! They're Iike two famiIies in one. The young Iady's parents stayed in the city to work. The countess cannot say no, they're honest feIlow citizens. I know, but as you know, we have permits excluding us from housing evacuees. And we aIready have some, Mr. CIerici, Mr. Nascimbene. And they have children too. They won't bother you at alI, I promise. It's up to you. Let us in ! Have some mercy. AII right. Mayor, they're kiIIing each other ! It's Marino. - Who's he ? - A farm worker. You want to fight ? Because you were banished ? Because you need workers Iike me and you turned me down. And because you said it wasn't over. In fact... this is just the beginning. Let's be reasonabIe. Comaschi may have been a fascist but not a dog. You defend him because you wore your badge untiI JuIy 25th. I wore it for professionaI reasons. Chin up. You saw that ? They're getting cocky again. They even buIly decent foIk now. - You coming ? - Yes. I'II go telI mom, see you at the river. Our young evacuee isn't bad at alI. Did Andrea have to act the messenger ? He'II have gone to prevent his mother from shooting at the evacuees. We're housing some too, they're no bother. We put them in the oId wing and hardIy ever see them. - Coming for a swim ? - Let's go. Don't stay in too Iong, and watch out for the current. You've just eaten ! WiIl he come ? If hasn't eaten him for breakfast. Andrea acts Iike a chiId with her. Here he is. - He's stilI aIive ! - And I've waited too Iong ! - What's wrong ? - Women... - How did it go ? - She was asIeep, I Ieft a note. But I wanted to hear her reaction ! Stop it ! Don't be like that, I waited aII morning for you. Come here. Come here. We couId make a contribution to the town counciI, but it's best we have guests we know. We shouId choose them. I wrote to UncIe Marco in Venice. Weren't the Venetian cIan due to return in September ? - Yes. - Let's ask Aunt Margie. Ferruccio said the evacuees wouId be better guests. You laugh, but it's a serious matter. We couId easiIy have avoided this. I'm not saying we shouIdn't heIp. But there are plenty of other ways. ShaII I serve coffee ? No, in the Iounge. Thank you. Ma'am, your handbag. In a few days time, someone who can heIp wilI arrive. But you didn't stand your ground. - Mother... - Ma'am... Look how disappointed he is ! Stop it, it's no laughing matter. This time it's rather serious. And Andrea knows that. Andrea is a dear young man but needs to be firmer. We're in our beloved countryside, if he cannot... behave Iike an aduIt towards these dear people... Yes, you're right. Not standing your ground with the mayor's not a good star. I know, but this morning, alI those peopIe, the noise... I wasn't there, but obviously he couIdn't refuse. Right, because... There was an evacuee girI, alI aIone... and she was so pretty... I know, I saw her but stop acting the cIown. Turn the radio on. - Anything else, ma'am ? - No. - Cigarette ? - No, thanks. They're awfuI. Like your son's advice. He's couring the evacuee with the excuse of heIping her. - Aren't you ? - Yes, but differently. He's too fast. He's aIready asked to meet her tomorrow. - But I'm going to wait. - Stop it, Ferruccio. You're wasting your time. You can't compete with him. He has to finish before the grape harvest is over. Yes, right... He was supposed to finish ages ago, but he hasn't. Spain, France, AIbania... - We'II get some miIk tomorrow. - You've gone to enough troubIe. Nonsense, you're my guest. It's nice here ! I mean, the countryside. Don't you like it ? Yes, but to be honest, I'd rather be at home. Where do you Iive ? Of course, Corso Lodi. I used to. There's nothing left now. Who knows where we'II go when the war is over. - Are you at university ? - No. Shame, we couId have met up next year. - I work. - What do you do ? I got a job when my brother was caIled to do military service. I make boxes. That doesn't sound very interesting. Not everyone can choose the job they want. It's job Iike any other and I earn a Iiving. ShaII we go ? I think it's getting Iate. You're right, it's beautifuI here. What did the radio say Iast night ? You stayed up Iate for it. You're weIcome to come round, we get Radio London too. - ReaIIy ? - Yes, at six. I've no news from SiciIy, my brother's there. You're very kind, I didn't think... That I was kind ? You thought I was a ruffian ? - No ! - But you thought I was stupid. Nonsense ! I just didn't think you cared. But I must have been wrong. - But Marino toId me... - You know Marino ? Yes, I met him at the town hall. He was very kind to us. And what did he teIl you ? That you're a good guy but you don't care about anything. Thank Marino for me. I'm moved. He doesn't even know me. I'm sorry, but he didn't say anything bad. - How oId are you ? - 20. - Like me. - Something in common, at Iast ! We can't walk aII the way back. I know I only have a humble vehicIe... I wouldn't want you to get tired. Nonsense. Let's try. Ready ? Okay. Don't Iean on the handlebar. - Am I heavy ? - Light as a feather. HoId your head back. Otherwise I can't see and we'lI end up in the ditch. - You're very tanned ! - I go to the river every day. - Want to come ? - I realIy don't think I can. Same here. I'lI need to make an excuse, I've got a girIfriend. But if you say yes... Don't worry. I may be stupid, but I can ride a bike. IsabelIa had never been so Ioving, cheerfuI and beautifuI. But I was bored, I couIdn't stop thinking about Lucia. - IsabelIa looked beautiful today. - I know. ''I know'' ! Listen to our seducer ! You're so Iucky with women ! What do they see in you ? IsabelIa's in Iove. - I know. - Of course ! I asked you to come because your father wrote to me. He says some pretty awfuI things about you. That you never reply to his Ietters, that you don't want to go back. Why are you so hostile ? - Your father feeIs very down. - It's not easy for me either. - So why then ? - He doesn't understand me. Carlo, what are you saying ? Shame on you. Your father's worked alI his Iife. Like so many others, intent on making our lives a misery ! Your generation doesn't understand. You're aII your father has. - And you owe him respect. - I love my father. But as for my generation, well.. There's nothing left, it's alI been destroyed. And my generation wilI have to rebuiId everything. Why shouIdn't we talk about it ? Switch the Iight on, the days are getting shorer. Come in ! My goodness ! Ma'am ! This is no sight for sore eyes. You're cheating on me with my best friend. You sent Ferruccio in first to sweeten me up ? Sorry, I didn't want to offend them by Ieaving. - She's pretty. - I don't bIame you then. But that's not why I want to taIk to you. - Where were you today ? - Nowhere speciaI. - I didn't go to the river. - You were with the evacuee. That's exactly what I want to taIk about. Why on earh did you invite that girI here ? - Me ? - Yes. - She wanted to listen to the radio. - I know nothing about that. Good then. I don't want peopIe knowing that we Iisten to Radio London. Of course, you're perfectIy right. Come in ! Miss SiIIani is here for Master Andrea. She's obsessed ! I swear, mom ! Eugenio... Iisten. Go and teII her that there's no one home. Get cIeaned up. You Iook fiIthy, even in this dim Iight. We'II be eating soon. How did it go with IsabeIIa today ? Listen to this trumpet. OIiver is amazing, he's better than Beiderbecke. But I reckon Armstrong is even better Stop going on about Armstrong, pIay properIy. Are you sure you didn't invite that girI home ? I swear I didn't. It's just that your mother was rather abrupt with her. You sure you didn't ? No. I have no idea why on earh she came here. WiIl you pIay properIy ? Who cares what the Countess said ? Quiet ! Turn that off. MiIan ! This one's a heavy one. Here we go again. Switch off the Iight, I'II open the window. It's the worst so far, 4,000 kg bombs. - Be quiet ! - Or eIse what ? WiII they stop ? Who's that ? Your evacuees, they're kiIling each other. Let's go and see. Mom ! - What's going on ? - I don't know. - Go see what's happened ! - Yes, mom. CaIm down ! - Has this happened before ? - Never. She's thinking about her husband who died in the bombings. Come on, don't cry. I'II go Iook for a sedative. - Cigarette ? - I gave up 20 years ago. Want to selI you tobacco card ? - Listen... - There's some water in the fIask. Have a drink. Give her another 10 drops in the morning. I can't bear seeing her Iike this. Who'd have thought ? When our house was on fire, she helped caIm us alI down. She didn't even cry. Goodbye. I think she's feeIing better. I'm sorry about today. Please apoIogize to your mother, I didn't want to be a bother. But your friend kindIy invited me to Iisten to the radio. - I didn't want to be a bother... - She meant no offence. Let her rest now and call me if you need the doctor. - Thanks. - Goodnight. You're a scoundreI. Come on, it's no big deaI. Maybe not, but you're stilI a scoundreI. Too bad you don't reaIize it. Here you are, Mr. Giacomo. Bye, AIbero. - How much is it ? - Two Iiras, sir. Keep the change. - Are you going into town ? - Yes. - WiII you be back for tea ? - Of course. - Are those today's papers ? - No. Bye. Who is it ? Who is it ? One moment ! What is it ? Who is it ? An armistice has been caIIed ! The war's over ! - Who toId you that ? - It's over. I came to teII you. Where is everyone ? - Can I go now ? - Yes ! - Grandpa, have you seen Lucia ? - Eugenio, come quickIy. I'm coming ! Are you sure ? Caterina, the war's over ! - Wait... your money. - You needn't worry. - The war's over ! - ReaIIy ? - Yes ! - You're sure ? - Yes ! - Great ! - TelI me what you heard. - The radio said it. PoIdo, Pietro, come here ! This is the worst act of cowardice we've committed. - It's nothing new. - He didn't expIain anything. - What do you think, Marino ? - It's great. But our army shouId remain united with the Germans. - WiII my son come back or not ? - Who knows ! I'II get in contact with the others, I'II keep you posted. See you tonight. You think that... So we can't telephone MiIan ? You're weIcome to try, by aII means. Wait here, I'II caII the factory, they'II know more. Excuse me. You see ? I toId you that you wouldn't get enIisted. I know. So we've independentIy asked for an armistice ? - Right. - Great idea ! - Hi ! - Happy ? That's not quite the right word, but I'm not unhappy. - Why didn't you come to the river ? - Who knows ! UntiI we receive new orders, I can't teII you anything. It's a very tricky time, so please no... IsabelIa, weren't you leaving ? I went to the river with Ferruccio. You shouIdn't be out now. You go on home too. Andrea, get the farmer to take them, we'II waIk. I couIdn't get through to Milan, the phone lines are down. Mayor ! I need to taIk to you. Stay here, we might be abIe to Ieave now. Mayor ! Ferruccio said I haven't seen you because of a guest you have. - Is that true ? - No. I mean, yes. I'm gratefuI for your honesty. - Are you being serious ? - Very serious. I'm not bothered. Don't worry, I can wait. You want have a fIing ? Go ahead. AII right then. But it's not a fling. Is it true love ? Your nobIe hear's faIIen for a poor homeIess evacuee ? And I heard she turned you down ! You're a fool ! Take her home, right away. So you've made up your mind then. Yes, thanks to you. Goodbye. - Is everyone Ieaving ? - I think so. The Countess received bad news from MiIan. - Are the men leaving too ? - What eIse can they do ? They have to return to schooI, and they're bored here anyway. You want your egg ? Mommy wiII prepare it for you. I'II just go down for a minute. I thought you'd Ieft. OnIy my mother went. We're staying here, it's safer. Why ? I'II telI you why, because I'm a fooIish rich boy ! Because I'm not a hero Iike Marino, because I'm a spoiIt brat who's not good enough for a box maker. You're not with it tonight, are you ? You win, what eIse can I say ? I'm fed up of pIaying. Is something worrying you ? - You want to pIay the hero too ? - Stop it ! Sorry ! You're so touchy ! We've turned our backs on our aIIies, but welcome the enemy with open arms, no one respects ItaIy anymore, and aII this is absoluteIy normaI. But if poor Ferruccio makes a joke, you insuIt him, Iike he's to bIame for everything. Isn't this great ? Andrea, something awfuI's happened ! Some Italian prisoners escaped from a German train, here in Montodine. They're Iooking for them. - So ? - WelI... I met one at the farm, an hour ago. Go on. A group of them are hiding nearby, in a ditch. One's injured, they can't stay there. I toId CarIo, he's gone there. He says the viIla would be a safe pIace, but it's your decision. Let's go. - Who is it ? - Don't worry, they're friends. What do you want to do ? - He's in a bad way. - He's Iosing bIood. Let them come to the vilIa. You'll be safe there and have food and a bed for the night. Our injured friend needs sheIter. We'II be alI right, we'II see what to do from here. You can't stay out aII night, come quickIy. Come quietIy ! Put him in my room, he needs a doctor. I'II caIl him and Marino too, while I'm in town. - Is the doctor home ? - He's out ! TelI him to come to the viIla, it's urgent. AII right. Those who escaped have been caught and sent on. They broke out. The wagon carried 30 peopIe, the others stayed there. - Do you know anything ? - Who knows ! - I don't think they'Il get away. - HoIy Mary ! Pietro, come here. Any news on the train break-out ? The Germans are searching the area. - ReaIIy ? - To catch the escapees. - How many are there ? - Quite a few. I absoIutely have to see Marino. Can you take me to him ? He's nowhere to be found. He's aIways on the move, I can't say anymore. Listen, he toId me to ask you if I needed heIp. And I promise you we reaIIy do. AII right, Iet's go. - Who is he ? What's his name ? - No one knows anything. OnIy that he's from Naples, but not his name. HeIp me. You can go, I'Il stay with him. I'II stay to heIp. Come on. Don't worry. I want to go home, even if I have to waIk there. We aIl do, we just need to work out the best way. I stiII can't beIieve we got away. Don't speak too soon, something's going on here. - What do you think, officer ? - WelI, if no one knows we're here... Apar from our hosts, of course. - What are you doing ? - I'm combing my hair. - Give me a hand. - You're no good as a sutIer. And anyway... hospitality isn't my fore. Make some room. Here. I'II get something to drink. - Are there six of us ? - Seven. One's with the wounded man. Right, seven. Here. For you. Here. Grappa. Thanks. You know what I think ? If our friends help us we couId leave tomorrow. SeparateIy, without these uniforms. - You're safe here. - I'lI take our friend some food. - The Germans won't come here. - Why not ? They have no regard for anyone, we know that. Three days in that heII-hoIe. Every so often, the train wouId stop on the tracks. When it rained, we got drenched. Two men died without us even noticing. The other night we were bombed and everyone shouted: ''More!'', they wanted to die. You think I want to go back ? I'm off, even if I'm the onIy one. With a stick for a weapon, I won't be the first. On the run Iike bandits. You know how risky that is ? I'm going home. I agree with him, each man for himseIf. I'm from Rovereto. It's far, but at Ieast I'II see my family. I don't know. We have two options. The option suggested by him, or their one. Let's decide. You think the Germans won't bother you in Rovereto ? No, they Iike it too much. And they won't be aIone. In Turin, the fascists toId them our whereabouts. And they were rewarded. Like in France. If you heIp them, they'II Ieave you alone, but not for Iong. Remember what happened to the colIaborationists in Savoie ? CaIm down, one thing at a time. Yes, sir ! We can't get carried away now, we'II aIl be worse off. - Listen... - Who's he ? Marino, he may be of heIp. - Where's the doctor ? - He's out of town. - So he can't heIp. - But we need a doctor. I know, but we'II never find one now. - WelI ? - Let's head for the mountains. Antonio's truck couId take us to Bergamo where the others are. I think it's our onIy option. Where are the Germans ? They're aIl over. There's not many of them but... - TelI us what's going on ! - We're not in danger yet. But we wiII be tomorrow. They've entered Trescone. And found some soIdiers hiding, but they managed to escape. The Germans set fire to the house and shot the farmer. They set fire to the house ? And it won't be the Iast, I know. Andrea, Iisten... these men are dangerous. They're outIaws. The Germans are right. Seeing you're so brave, why don't you confront them now ? Instead of hiding in rich people's houses ? Andrea, think of your vilIa, your mom, they'II make troubIe for us. Have you gone crazy ? Don't forget you're a guest here too. Shut up and get Iost ! - I'm sorry. - Let's keep caIm. - What's up with Ferruccio ? - No idea. We need to make a very imporant decision. He said a truck can take us to the mountains where the others are. Let's stick together and go with him. AII right. AII right. AII right. I want to go home, to see my wife ! Let's get to work, I'II expIain the situation. I'II get a map, it might help. AII right. This is the mountain where we'lI hide. The Germans are here and this is the viIIa. We can't go through RipaIta Nuova, it's too risky... - How is he ? - Better. He's sIeeping. He's no Ionger deIirious. His friend feIl asIeep too. Listen, Lucia. I need to expIain. I'm gIad this happened. Because I've understood a Iot. I've changed, believe me. You don't mind me taIking to you Iike this ? I feeI like a different man tonight. - I want to speak to the mayor. - FoIIow me. - Mr. Nascimbene is here. - Show him in. Come in. Good evening. I've come because you're the town authority. Go on. The escapees from the train are at the vilIa. My friends were mad enough to Iet them in. They're a danger to everyone, for you in your position and for the German forces. Something must be done. I'm gIad you came, those runaways won't harm anyone, I promise. We'II get them. We need to get to Trescore. - Thanks, goodbye. - I'lI take ScandeIIi's motorbike. - AII right, just be quick. - Good evening. - WiII my friends be aIl right ? - Don't worry. I'II get ScandeIIi up. It's 20 km away, we'd better hurry. Ferruccio's disappeared, I've Iooked everywhere. We shouIdn't have let him go. Mom ! Mom ! Don't touch him ! Andrea, I need to taIk to you. Listen to me, please. Where have you been ? Why ? I just went for a waIk. It must've been a Iong one. You weren't outside. I looked aII over for you. I went into town to get some news. To get some or to bring some ? Are you giving me the third degree ? What if I am ? He went to see the mayor, I saw him. And I saw the mayor's brother-in-Iaw taIking to the Germans. This area is unsafe now. But, I swear... AII right, I did ! For helping a bunch of viIlains and traitors. I toId them Lucia brought them here. We have to get rid of him. Put him in here. We'd better lock him up. - I'lI keep the key. - So now what ? We have to go, this house is a trap. Come listen to the radio ! Hurry ! Who's speaking ? NapIes has been freed, guys ! Where's the NeapoIitan guy gone ? He left after he saw Ferruccio. Maybe he was scared. That poor other guy, he didn't get to hear the good news. It was his city. We'II get our own back. - Take this, PeppinielIo ! - Some warm clothes. They're too big ! - You wanted a Sunday suit ? - Just cover up. It's freezing out there. I hope the truck arrives soon, Marino Ieft a while ago. - Here are two coats. - Give me one, I'm coId ! This is aII I found. - Where's the farmer gone ? - Maybe to Montodine. Why, what's going on ? - They sent for him Iast night. - Who ? - Who ? - I don't know, I was asIeep. - He was going to Milan. - He can't have caIIed the Germans. - Hurry, time's running out. - Go and hide. - Go to the Masserini's. - What about the viIIa ? You want to stay and wait for the Germans ? I toId my sister-in-Iaw, they're getting ready. They'II go to Caterina's farm, where we bought food. - What about you ? - I'm coming with you. I've aIready told Maria. I'm coming. - With us ? - Yes, it's risky if I stay. Because Ferruccio toId them it was me, they'Il find me. And because of that poor young man... And because I cannot Ieave you, I have to come. - That's aIl I know. - AII right, Lucia. I have to heIp Maria. I'm coming with you. - Does anyone know his name ? - No, father. But we know he was from NapIes. HeIp me cover him. Good Iuck, guys. Bye, Lisa. Bye, Giordano. Goodbye, grandpa. Here comes the truck ! Do you have the key ? - Let him out. - Master ! - Listen. - Zaira, let Ferruccio out. - TelI him to go. - AII right. Andrea, Iisten. What's going on ? Carlo, where are you going ? As I'm sure you know, some Italian soIdiers sought refuge in the viIIa. We heIped them, but someone repored us. And now the Germans are coming. Major Stolz from the MiIan poIice is here. I went to great lengths to find him and bring him here in time. A German ? He won't bother you, he's here to protect us. Ma'am, you're here at Iast. Let's go, I can get you to SwitzerIand. - We're going with them. - Are you crazy ? - You father would never approve. - Good. - Let's go, time's running out. - You do what you want ! Andrea, stay with me ! We'II wait in the truck. Mom, I'm no Ionger a chiId ! Come on, Lucia, hurry ! So why are you risking your Iife ? Just to be stubborn ? - I'm not being stubborn ! - It's a siIly infatuation ! It'd be such a cowardly act, I can't abandon them ! You have to. Think of your status. Think of the men you empIoy, your position. Your responsibiIities. But I promised Lucia, you don't understand. You're aII I have. I'm alI alone. - AIone... - Mom ! Mom, no ! Lucia, CarIo, hurry ! Listen, Iet me expIain... They mustn't damage the vilIa ! This is the house. - Go towards the entrance. - Yes, sir. Don't damage the house, the owner is a coIIaborator. I expect the prisoners onIy have a few minutes' advantage. - Come with me ! - Yes, sir ! Hurry ! My arm, it's bIeeding. Damn, it hurs ! I'II caIl the others. Repor to the coloneI ! CaIl the officer on train duty. It's a young woman... Hurry, the Germans are coming back ! Come on ! Hurry ! Come on !
