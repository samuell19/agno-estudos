Claire Girard. Heard of her? The famous pianist. Classical music. Claire Girard. One of the five best in the world. The only woman. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Honored to meet you. Thank you. Claire Girard. - Know her? - No, but I'm thrilled to meet her. You may have heard her play without realizing it. enormous I'll check us in. Thanks. Seen the view? Yeah. - Gorgeous. - Closer than ever to the Empire State. - Great! - We can touch it! - Are you happy? - Yeah. I have to work. Here. - We go to the theater at 4. - Thanks. I'm burning up here. Claire? You know the rehearsal... is at 4 o'clock. - When does the tuner come? - 5 o'clock. - What time do we play? - What? - What time do we play? - We play at 8:30. Not much rehearsal time. Have the tuner come later, that's not enough time. Notice anything? You're handsome? No, I'm ugly. No, you're not ugly. Notice anything new? Like an animal? You really don't see it? Nothing seems new to you? You got new boxers! Yes. Very nice. Really, you like them? Yeah. Very much. Then say so. Sometimes it feels like you don't see me. - A gift from your mom? - No. "You are cordially invited to a reception in honor of Claire Girard." I don't feel like going. We have to go. Too stressful? Shall I relax you? Yeah, good idea. Come. I'll listen from the room. I love you. A big bed. One big bed with a big mattress. Will you be needing an extra pillow? No, thank you. Goodbye. - What'd she say? - Nothing. She offered extra pillows. Like some bergamot tea? Bergamot! Here, dear. Shall we wear Soil of Damascus or Eggplant Delight? - Wear whichever you like. - I'm not wearing it. How about we wear the Cinderella? It's fantasy, it's totally impromptu... It's Fantaisie-Impromptu. Is something wrong? Time to go, honey. She's a bit tense. Could you reassure her? Stop freezing up. Ok? Stop. Let's go. You can do it. One, two, three... Like a bird, fly! You're on. Any questions? Does anyone have any other remarks? I want to thank you for these hours of happiness. The evening was truly exceptional. Exceptional! Thank you very much. Fred! Claire was fabulous. Her fingers are magical, like clouds! And her work with... She hates when I leave her alone. Claire! Come here, honey. It was truly fabulous. Thank you. What's your secret? - Work. - What? - Work! - No, not work. At your level you're like Nadal, the tennis player. It's something else, it's... I call it the gift. You know, behind every great woman is a man. As an ambassador's wife, are you an ambassadress? Is there an ambassadress behind every great ambassador? I hate to toot my own horn, but... And does it work the other way? When a woman does the job, she's called an ambassador. But... - Her husband is not an ambassadress? - No. What is he? Nothing. He's called sir. - Sir? - That's right. Do you feel you've sacrificed your life? In a sense, for your husband? I did all I could to keep the family unit together. How do you two manage? - With the kids? - Know how we manage the kids? It's simple, we have none. - No kids? - That's a sacrifice too. You know, we have no time, no room in our life. We travel all the time... That may be temporary. The Belgian Ambassador. Good evening. How are you? - You seem to love what you play. - Yes. Thank you. Does February 29th mean anything to you? - Yes, yes... - Your Magical Night? The Magical Night? - Will you play The Magical Night? - Seriously? Of course. Just one condition: you play Ravel's Concerto. But I don't play with orchestras anymore. - I only do recitals. - Trust Fred. Fred's a great agent. He's knows what's best for you. A woman has never played The Magical Night. Never, not a one. I want you to be the first. I'll get more champagne. Claire, aren't you happy? Well, I... - It's a year away. - Emmanuel... Here we go. Bravo. One for you, one for me. - Claire? - I don't drink. - Mr. Girard? - Yes, please. Delightful. Here you are. Is this your honeymoon? No. Although every day is a honeymoon with Claire Girard. - Fabulous. - It sure is. PILL Time for your pill. Thanks. Shall I relax you? Yes. We'll do it here. - Are you a doctor? - I know CPR. Can you help me? This woman is in labor. What can I do? Tell her the baby's coming. The head is crowning. She's about to give birth. Should we reroute the plane? I'll do an episiotomy. What's that? A tear in the perineum so the baby can come out. - Should I tell her? - Yes, explain. - What's your name? - Gilberte. Scissors. Tell her it's going to hurt. - Tell her first. - I will. No, don't push. Stop pushing. Put on his bonnet and give him to his mom. Please. Sir? Excuse me, sir... Excuse me, sir. The mother wants her baby. You can hold him again afterwards. Sorry. That's right. There's your baby. Are you happy? How do you feel? Any pain? What is it? Fred! - I can't! - What's up? Look at me, Fred. Look at me. What's on your mind? - Victor! Thanks. - Hi, Fred. - Hi. - Fred? Is something wrong? No, I'm fine. Life is good. What? Something seems wrong? - What is it? - I can help you. How so? Emotionally, spiritually... Come see me, we'll talk. - Ok. - Have a nice day, Fred. No new bookings until March. Right. Because Claire is playing The Magical Night. - Fred! - Yes? Cancel The Magical Night. One sec, let me get this in the fridge. Are you ok, honey? - I can't do it. - What? Cancel the orchestra, the whole thing. I can't do it. I'll be the orchestra for you. Wait'll I insert my flute! C... B... C... Too long! The flautist can't breathe, he died an hour ago! You're not alone now, you have to think of others. Pizza... Eat it all. Shit, I forgot the napkins! - Not eating? - I'm not hungry. Are you tense? Shall we do something to relax? - Like what? - I don't know. The usual. Right. - I have to go. - You do? Where? To my mom's. Why? Because... it's my birthday. - I didn't plan anything. - My 40th. I have no present! Shall I buy one with your credit card? I'll buy it for you, then I'll give it to you. - And you'll give it to me. - Ok. Perfect. Great. Don't you want to make love for your birthday? No, because I can tell you don't really want me. It's more about relaxing you. What? I'm not a spa! A what? A spa! Yes? Hello, my son. - Happy birthday. - Thanks, Mom. No, Frédéric! No more jumping on the couch! - Just testing it. - You're not 10 anymore! You'll burst the seams! You're making me mad now. I may not bring you coffee. - Sugar in your coffee? - No, Mom. - Cake? - No, Granny! - Tiramisu? - Is there a bar mitzvah? No, it's your birthday so I made some cakes. Tell me how it went in Japan. It was good. You look tired. Is it jetlag? Is it turning forty? Are you feeling down? Has the FBI finished yet? I'm just wondering if my son is fine or not. I helped at a childbirth. A woman gave birth on the plane. - On the plane? - Yeah. - I held the baby. - I see. It's a special feeling. Don't burst into tears! It made you want your own baby. - Yes, but with Claire. - Right. But your own baby. - Your own progeny, your own child. - With Claire. Obviously with Claire! But your own child. - No? Your own? - Yes, of course. What's stopping you? You two aren't getting any younger. - Especially Claire. - She doesn't want kids. Then leave her. Boom! Done and dusted. Think it's funny? Have you no shame? - Didn't she get her tubes tied? - What? Behind your back? What are you on about? Her tubes? Ask her. She may have. She's taking the pill, that's all. You need to find a solution. You handle everything, right? So? Her pills and everything? - Right? - Yeah, why? Give her a different pill instead. Just kidding! Just messing around. These look like little pills. C'mon... Fred! What? - You hear me? - Yes. - You're not answering. - I couldn't hear, I was peeing. A baby, a baby! I'm coming! Right, but... Gimme two seconds. I'm almost there. Just a sec. Please. Wanna get on top? Get on top. - Where are you going? - For a pee. - But why? - Because I'm dying to. What do I do with this? Listen... - I can't fake it. - I'm almost there! I want to come inside you. What's the big deal about coming inside me? The flush is broken? One, two, three. Hurry back. What are you doing? I need to pee, too. Hurry up! Not pregnant - Hey! - Hi. I just dropped by to see how you're doing. Wanna come in? I just made coffee. Sure, great. - Have a seat. - Thanks. You smoke a pipe? - Do you mind? - No, go ahead. Do you know what I do? - I'm a shaman. - A shaman? I see. Like American Indians? No. The word "shaman" is Mongolian. "He who knows. He who does things backwards." He who goes against the grain? - Right. Or the fool. - The fool? I say things, and I don't know why. But the things are said. And the patient knows why. I want to have a baby. Right, I understand. Women are lucky they can give life. So true. I'll remove my Victor outfit and put on my shamanic outfit. And take my shamanic name. - Which is? - Zolinkan. It means Lord of the Desert. It may seem pretentious... but it came to me in a sweat lodge. Yeah? - In what country? - In France, in Macon. - Is that right? - Yeah. Local shamans taught me. I see. What's the music? Native American chants? Not at all. The music is German. Pagan Metal. Close your eyes and relax. Any problems in childhood? I want you to visualize a seed in your stomach. The seed takes root. It sprouts leaves, young leaves, tender leaves. The seed is your child. Care for it as though it sprang from your breast. When the seed is ready, see your wife's belly, round and full... Use this moment of grace to care for your body and yourself, and realize your dreams. How long do you think it'll take to start working? Why, is it urgent? Take this stone. It's calcite. Take good care of it. Live with it until your wife gets pregnant. - Yes? - Excuse us. Could I get a photo with you? Smile. Say cheese. Thank you. Wait, where are you going? I want you. This is weird. Five times already today! I don't care. People might come through! Who cares? It doesn't matter! Your belly is so hard! What? No it's not. - Have you been nauseous? - No. - No nausea at all? - No. Are your breasts sore? Strange, isn't it? Everywhere we go, the flush is broken. It's your fault. Are you taking it apart? What choice do I have? I need to verify the reservoir... the cylinder head... Forget it! It worked, it worked! The flush is working, look! Working so great! I'm starving! Here we are. You can't just eat a kiwi. I've gained weight. No honey, you're beautiful. My clothes feel tight. - Could be thyroid cancer. - It's not thyroid cancer. - A cyst? - No, honey. - I may have cancer. - That's not what you have. - You know what I have? - Yes, I know what I have. So what do I have? Ok, I'll confess. I have to tell you sometime. This is the kind of thing, if you wait too long, it can get out of proportion, so you better not wait, because if you do... The thing is, it was totally out of the blue. It was one of those times when you go, "Oh right! "Oh right! This can actually happen!" And you're like, "Ok, this can happen!" You go, "Really? This can happen? Life... can happen?" "Oh yes! Take it from me! Life can happen." Ok. You think you've seen it all, but it turns out you haven't. Sometimes you're expecting... And then you're like, "I wasn't expecting that!" I'm not following you. Please don't get mad. Don't take it badly. Hang on, I don't know what it is. I have to tell you, dammit. I have to tell you. I'm listening. You... Sorry. Remember the birth in the plane? The baby? You're that nonplussed about it? Anyway... The mother asked me if I'd like to be... her son's godfather. Did you say yes? We don't need that in our busy life. Seriously. Tell her no. You'd have no time for him. It's a bad idea. Why is it a bad idea? It's not hard to... What if both parents die in a plane crash? Come off it! Nobody dies like that! Sure they do, people die. What if we get stuck with the kid? We'll do what all parents do! I could've had my own child. But why do it if I don't have time? If you found a baby on the ground, you'd leave it there? Our life doesn't allow it. He'd be raised by a babysitter. That's no life for a child. We've discussed this. There's no room for a child in our life. You should call that woman back. We two plus a child doesn't add up. It doesn't work. - Are you ok? - What was that? My button. My breasts are huge! Make an appointment with the gynecologist. - That'll be tricky. - Why? Our busy schedule. We can't see a gynecologist for... no abortion after 12 weeks... 12 weeks. I haven't seen you in awhile, Mrs. Girard. How are you? I feel bloated all the time and my breasts hurt. When was your last period? Oh right, you're taking Desogestrel. - Are you handling it ok? - Yes. No spotting? Do you ever forget to take it? No. Fatigue is an early sign of cancer, right? You seem very anxious. - Rest assured. - But fatigue is an early sign... Fatigue is a common symptom. Of course. But cancer is common too. Come now! Why are you so anxious? Is a big event looming? Yes, indeed. A very big concert. Any idea when your mother started menopause? - Actually... - We no longer speak. It doesn't matter. I'll examine you, we'll see what's up. You do have a bit of a bump. A tumor? It runs up to the belly button. Let's take a look. I'll put some gel on your tummy. It's a bit cold. So... Now I see. It's a baby. A baby cancer? No, a normal baby. A normal baby? See the head? Look! Are you sure that's my belly? - It's moving. - Not archive images? That's your belly. This is happening inside you. Better a baby than cancer. I'll check for more. There could be more? The head measures... - The head! - 5 centimeters. You're at approximately 4 months. Want to hear the heartbeat? Yes, if... - Mrs. Girard? - Shall we, honey? Listen to the heart to see... Hear it? - Shall I check the gender? - No. We'll let that be a surprise. Honey, we don't want to know the gender, right? She doesn't want to know. Terminating a pregnancy at this stage is complicated. There are risks. We'd have to provoke delivery. It's illegal in France. But I can't. Listen, Claire... I'll take care of it. On your own? You'll do the abortion? No, I'll take care of the baby. What do you mean? How? Is late abortion legal in England? Yes, England authorizes late-stage abortions. But it's dangerous. I don't advise it. No. We're not putting your life in danger, or the baby's. Does it hurt real bad? They do a general anesthetic. People die from it daily. - No, far from it. - Still. But it is risky. There is a problem... With what? With the dates. I have an important concert. Let's figure it out. We have a concert we can't miss. - The concert is February 29th? - That's right. Your due date is February 27th. But you may well deliver earlier. Anytime after January 26th. Great! January 26th is fine. Honey! From that point forward, the baby will be mature. The pregnancy reaches term on February 27th. January 26th Hello everyone. I'm Caroline, a resident midwife. Welcome to our workshop "Love, Milk and Cuddles." A big title for a workshop about breastfeeding. Hello, everybody. How are you? - Sorry I'm late. - No worries. Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves. Tell me who you are. Everyone's here now. Your wife couldn't make it today? No, she's working. - First baby? - Yes, I'm a primipara. Know the gender? I think it's a girl, based on the shape of the belly. - You know. - Right. - But we can't rely on that! - Not at all. Here's something you can try at home, when you get home tonight. I'll show you how to extract colostrum from your breast. Place your fingers on either side of the nipple. Press in towards your thorax, pinch, then come forward. With your fingers around the nipple, you'll get a few drops of colostrum. Women are made to breastfeed. We're mammals, it's natural. When the baby is born, we have all we need to nourish it. Who wants to try? - I will. - Me too. Let's set the pillow up differently. You may have noticed your nipple is darker. That's because newborns only see contrasts up close. This helps them find it. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo. Look! Her little toilet seat. So she can go poo-poo, so she can go pee-pee! With her little bum-bum! Yoo-hoo, bum-bum! Look what I brought, Claire. Know what it is? Dunno. A breast? A rubber breast? It's hideous. You use it to situate the baby's mouth. Dang, I drooled! I'm starving. I'm dying for some Nutella! Yeah, hello. No, unfortunately Claire is not available. Not for a few weeks. A few weeks, really? Gotta go. Speak soon. Sorry, gotta go. My BabyCook! For Baby. I'm gonna make a pile of puree! Let me ask Baby. I don't want any puree. Do you want carrot puree or potato puree? For carrots, kick here. For potatoes, kick here. - Wait, wait! - Did he answer? - She answered. - What'd she say? She wants carrots! My little Beeboon! "Congratulations, your baby is as long as a Swiss chard." - What? - Wow! - A vegetable? - Before she was a fennel. - Why compare them to vegetables? - For the size. They're pineapples at 33 weeks! I love this app. You can do a belfie. A selfie with your bump. "You're starting your 9th month of pregnancy." Already? Today? It's January 26th? I'm giving birth today? Great! Why didn't you tell me? Pack the suitcase. Don't forget the nightshirt. C'mon, let's give birth. When's it scheduled? Mustn't make them wait. - Hi, Claudio. - Hi, Fred. - How are you? - Good, you? - We came... - To have the baby. The baby? - Is today the day? - Yes. We came for an appointment, to... - Have the baby. - See the doctor. See the doctor, ok. See the label? YBF: "Your Baby's Friend." This is as good as it gets. - Anne! - Hey, Fred! - How are you? - Good, you? - Great! All good? - Yep! Meet Beeboon. Hi Beeboon! How are you? - Hi Beeboon! - And I'm Claire. Hi Claire! How are you? - My partner. - I'm ok. I'll be better after the birth. Is today the day? No, we'll... - We'll see. - We'll see? Gotta go. See you around! Hey girls! I want you to meet someone. - How are you? - Good. Sorry I missed the last class, I had morning sickness. I made a cheesecake for us, but I ate it all myself! Of course you did! - See you later? - Yeah, bye. Bye, girls. - Coming? - Bye Beeboon! You know everyone here. - Claire Girard? - Yes? C'mon. Is the baby moving well? Very well. When I lay my hand here, she snuggles right in. Just like that. Let me ask your wife. Is the baby moving? - Yes. - Very well. I see your birth plans. Did you write them together? No, I have plans, but no birth plans. It says here you want a water birth. - Yes, by birth canal. - In a canal? Not in a canal. Through the birth canal. But you do want a water birth, right? - Yes... - Very well. In that case, no epidural. Is that ok? Are we sure about that? It makes the woman's experience more... The woman's experience? She's the one giving birth. - I wish it was me. - Right, but you can't. To give birth, you have to be a woman. Period. The woman gives birth. So, do you want an epidural or not? I think I'd like one. We're here for you. It's not up to your husband to decide what you want or don't want. Fine. You two just decide without me. My choices don't matter. Do what you like, Claire. I've got no swimsuit. No swimsuit. When the baby comes, how will you feed him? - I'll be breast feeding. - I see. Men can do that now? You attach a prosthetic breast to your nipple, which is connected by a tube to the mother's milk... - And then... - Quite the plan. Will you use cow's milk or mother's milk in the bottles? We will use "maternal" milk. It doesn't just come out. The baby has to suckle the mother's breast. If I were to suckle the breasts, would that make the milk rise? Though I won't pump like Baby? Are you fine with him... I'm not sure she agrees. I don't want to breastfeed. You don't have to if you don't want to. This is your baby too. Not just his. But I'm the one who wanted it. You wanted a child? No. - Really? - No. Have you seen a psychologist? No, we don't need one. Let's switch to Trousseau. They're a high-tech hospital, and they won't think we're crazy. Sir, ma'am. Hello. How can I help you? We came to have a baby. How far along are you? 9 months. - First time here? - Yes. - You didn't sign up in advance? - No. There's probably no room for you. You're really at 9 months? 9 months, down to the wire? Come on in. Thank you. Hello, Océane. Hello. - Océane is a student midwife. - Nice to meet you. That was a bit of a walk! Date of conception? May 27th. Exactly. What time is the birth? - I can't tell you the time. - Really? Even the exact date is hard to determine. But we're having the baby today. I don't think that's very likely. You said the date of conception was May 27th. - Yes. - So... Océane and I will calculate the due date. Your due date is February 27th. So it's not coming out today? You've got a month to go. Say something! - So I made a mistake? - Yes. You're just starting your 9th month, you haven't done it yet. How can it be, Fred? - I don't know. - How can it be? - So it's like centuries? - Yes. The 19th century is the 1800s. That's right. Same thing for babies. Like centuries, they take longer than expected. So you're saying pregnancy lasts 10 months? Take off your coat and get in the stirrups. Could you lift the sweater? She's all yours. Océane, start at the top of the pubic symphysis to measure the fundal height. How many centimeters? - 24. - That's not much. Especially a month from delivery. Proceed to palpation, Océane. Make sure it's not too small for the date. Beeboon, Beeboon! They're measuring you! You were diligently taking birth control pills, but this baby decided to come into your life, correct? - It was an accident. - An accident. Right. A happy accident? Why are you looking at me? Baby! Hello. I'll get you set up. One sensor listens to the baby, one measures contractions. Relax, then I'll take your blood pressure. Baby! Hey there! That's a big belly! I'd love to have twins. - Yeah? - Two at once, you get it over with. BAN FORCED MARRIAGE So cute! See the baby bees? Isn't that adorbs? Excuse me, could someone help us? Yikes! It's enormous. It just started swelling. - It sure did. - It tripled in size. - It's enormous! - Indeed. I'm scared. Alix, can you come to Explo? - I'm gonna explode? - No, don't worry. You said Explo. Is this the Explosion Ward? No, the Exploratory Ward. What's up? - It went from tiny to huge. - I'm gonna explode. Relax. Is this a normal pregnancy? It was, yes. Liquid is forming around the baby. We'll have a look. Don't drown! - Swim, Beeboon! - An ultrasound. - A what? - To see inside. I've never seen anything like it. Your baby's having a huge growth spurt. - What was the fundal height before? - 25. Unheard of! 42 now! We were at 24 earlier? Unheard of? I don't know why, but it's huge. Beeboon, what are you up to? You know this patient? It's growing... It's enormous. 113, 114... Godzilla was tiny to start. He was this big. A mere tadpole. Radiation turned him into a gigantic reptile breaking buildings. I have no desire... Ultrasound has no radiation. Even if it did, it wouldn't... Is it time? It's stabilizing a bit now. It's too soon to induce. Does it feel tight? Feels heavy as heck. Yeah? Is it straining your back or belly? Can we get it out now? There's no real reason to induce. I do have tips to help move things along if you like. Clean the house. Scrub the floors. I don't know how. Out of the question. Not moving is bad for the body. It's my house, I run it. Or there are natural ways, like the Italian method. What's the Italian Method? Eating pizza? No, it's not eating pizza. It's making love. The husband's sperm contains prostaglandins. I don't want to make love with the baby inside. The baby is in the uterus. The cervix has a mucous plug, protecting the baby. Right, the mucous plug! If you an orgasm, you'll have a contraction which is exactly the point. - Really? - That's why we recommend making love. Want a prescription? Sure. You could also try hypnosis and osteopathy. Osteopathy prepares the pelvic cavity and hypnosis addresses any anxiety. So those are good too. I've had it, I'm wiped out. Me too. I'm sick of carrying this. And I'm sick of carrying this! I'm exhausted! Me too. My Next2Me came. - My beddy-bye buddy. - Beddy-bye buddy? No, this is my Baby Cocoon. A cocoon for Baby. Baby cocoon, baby coo-coo, koko, doodoo... Are you done? That was as cute as pie. I think it's corny. Well, I love my beddy-bye buddy. Baby can sleep with me. Right by me. Next to me. I wanted her to sleep between us. Between us? - It's cool to feel Baby. - Yeah? But then the midwife said Baby might suffocate in the blankets. I need to study the Close2U. I'll watch the tutorial. Hey... Fred? - Fred! - What? - Come help me! - Relax. No, I want to work. Coming. I can't. It's enormous. Can you please get up? I need you to be more independent. I can't care for you like before. I'm too busy. I gotta get on it. ...ensuring Baby's correct posture in all situations... What's the matter? I can't play. Time for drastic measures. - Fred! - What? Italian method! Look out, I'm coming. Let's go. Get rid of your beddy-bye baby. What're you doing? Italian method. We need to come together. The Italian method, now? Yes. No time to lose. I'm not feeling it... I can't do it with my hand on the belly. - Maybe I should get on top. - Yeah. No, bad idea. The belly's in my way. Let's try this. Here... No, no. The belly's squishing my face. The belly's still in the way, honey. I'm still not in. What is it? What's wrong? Contractions? - Did your water break? - Did it? What's it smell like? They say the water smells faint. So what's it smell like? - Cookies. - Cookies? Chocolate sandwich cookies. Damn, I ate too many! - Hello, ma'am. - My water broke. - My water broke. - Mine too. So you've ruptured. How long ago? - We ruptured? - No, the membranes did. We'll need to verify the rupture and fluid. Is this your first baby? Yes it is. I'm a primipara. The father is the primipara? - Yes. - How unusual. I'll need to know who your wife is. Claire Girard. G-I-R-A-R-D. Frédéric. - The pianist. - The pianist! Wonderful. I'm not into music, but... - First name? - Claire. Claire doesn't talk? The smell is very faint. He says... it doesn't smell like my vulva. No. It's not the usual smell. Take a whiff. Drop your legs to the sides and tell me when it's ok. I'm opening the speculum so I can look inside. All good? The tip of the swab is orange, see? Mrs. Girard, could you cough for me? I'll stop bothering you now. There's no clear rupture. It's negative. If it's not today, it'll be tomorrow. Right? Or the day after. You're at full term now. At this point, Baby decides. Just relax and enjoy it. Pamper yourself. Ok? Before starting the massage, empty your bladder and rectum for comfort. Spread the oil with your fingers, working up from the vagina along the labia majora with circular movements. Visualize a time arc from 3 to 9 o'clock along the posterior perineum. Hook your thumb into the vagina and swing... - Ow! - Sorry. - Does it hurt? - It's not nice. But it softens it up. Apply downward pressure at 6 o'clock to stretch the perineum. Then gradually move up the time arc, stretching at 3:00, 4:30, 6:00, 7:30 and 9:00. - I'm lost. - 4:30, 6:00, 7:30! Press firmly downward and hold. Hurts? I'm sorry. Relax the anus. Relax your anus. 10 minutes a day for 10 days and Baby will slide out like butter. Since Baby decides... I'll pamper myself. I'm home. Where are you guys? We're here. I bought a ton of stuff! Come tell me what you think. We really ought to reconfigure our space. - If we move the piano a tad... - Just sell it! And I bought a Baby Blow. A what? A Baby Blow. I'll show you. - Do I smell cigarettes? - Yeah, I smoked. I smoked 2 cigarettes. Excuse me? Why? Because I drank. What? I had some wine. It made me want to smoke. - No way! - I ate Camembert. To chase the taste, I had some wine. Then I wanted to smoke. You... Are you crazy? - What? - You're crazy! Know what it does to Baby? When I see cheese, I eat it! It's not cheese, it's poison! You're crazy! She's crazy! It's poison! Google it! Want Baby to get listeriosis and be stupid? What've you done? Is she still moving? Unbelievable! - Eat some sugar. - No. Eat it! Calm down. - Eat this! - No. Beeboon! Beeboon! Beeboon! She moved! See, it's not dead. Honey... You don't like camembert. What's wrong? I never drank, I never smoked, all I ever did was work. I just drank, and I liked it. So I think I'll keep drinking. Do you ever let go? Do you ever... you know... let go? Do you sometimes yearn to take a break, suspend time? Drop the piano, the score, the work? Drop Fred? What for? Right in front of you is an elevator... with magic doors. In the elevator, there are as many buttons as there are years of life for Claire. Let the elevator go down to the right number. Maybe it's... year one or year two. Maybe it's year zero. You can even imagine year minus one, when you're still in your mother's womb. Let the doors open. And go. Go forward. Go find that little girl. Envelope her. Keep holding her close. You can even... squeeze her tight. So tight, the little girl is you and you are the little girl. You are now one. - Did you come a long way? - Ground floor. Come in. - Can I sit down? - Please do. Thank you. I see it worked. What? The fertilization. I want it out. I've tried everything. Do you mind? May I? This child is unwanted. Why do you say that? I sense you didn't want it. True, I didn't. Yet it didn't come by chance. Yes it did, it came by accident. Accident? It was no accident. You seem to know more than you say. There are many things I know but don't say. Such as? I gave Fred an orange stone, a calcite. Do you know if he still has it? - How are you, Philippe? - I'm good. - And you, Fred? - I'm doing great. - And Claire? - She's good, too. Yeah? Cool! - Is Claire here? - No. - But she's coming? - No. I see. Clearly, Claire's not here. Claire's not here. For The Magical Night press conference. Claire's not here. You're wondering if Claire's here? She's not! If they say Claire's here, I say what? - "Claire's not here." - Exactly. And if I'm asked if Claire's here, I'll say, - "No, Claire's not here." - Let's practice. - Where's Claire? - Not here. Definitively! Hello, everyone. Where's Claire? She's not here. - She's not? - No. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm home! Well, in the end, it went fine. Seriously, they were cool about it. What the hell? What's wrong? Oh right! This is a stone that spreads good vibes in the home. I got some kebabs... How could you do this to me? How could I do what? From the very start, you lied to me. No. You trapped me. You got me pregnant behind my back. It's harder to do for a man. But you succeeded. I want you to admit you lied to me. I'm so disappointed in you. I'm sorry. - But... - I'm tempted to leave you. - Is it that bad? - Yes. - Where are you going? - Away. Where? Where people will talk to me, not to my belly. - Leaving with the baby? - Got some money? - No. - What're you afraid of? I don't want you to hurt the baby. Claire? What the hell brings you here so late? Come in, darling. Come give your old teacher a kiss. What the heck is that? - Dunno. - You didn't tell me. He got me pregnant behind my back. Why? Tell me. - He tampered with my pill. - How? Instead of giving me birth control, he gave me sweeteners. Why was he giving you the pill? Couldn't you take it yourself? No. Why did he have to do it? As your manager, he does so much. What more do you want? Stop being so proud, it's ridiculous. It simply means he wants a child with the woman he loves. You're wrong. He doesn't love me anymore. - He only loves the baby. - Nonsense! You think men have babies with women they don't love? You have your career, your music. It's a great force. A powerful life force. - He hasn't got that. - I can't play anymore. - Not getting that? - No. I've lost the phone. Outside the clinic... It was magical... having a baby with you! You're in the poddy? Oh, the lobby! - Hello. - Mr. Girard? I can only spare 5 minutes. It's "Dead Justice Day." We're having protests and debates. I can't give you much time. My daughter has been kidnapped. - Kidnapped? - Yes, by my wife. Well, if she left you, you can file a complaint. I'd rather not have to. Do you know where the child is? Yes, with my wife, inside my wife. - What? - She's inside. - So the child hasn't been born? - No, she hasn't. Legally, there's nothing we can do. But my wife left with her. - Why? Were you violent? - No. So what happened? She didn't want the baby. You forced her to have sex? No, never in a million years. I replaced her pills with sweeteners. Sir, that's very serious. You abused your wife. It could affect the outcome in a family court case. Then why'd I do all this? I think you need professional help. A mediator or a psychologist. A mediator? To help you communicate with your wife. It's a big surprise. Go ahead. - What is it? - You'll see. Big surprise. Yes, it's her. In the flesh! Claire was once my student, too. Nice to meet you, I'm Bettina, Ayala's student. Hey, congratulations! - For what? - The baby. She has an important concert coming up. - The Magical Night. - Right. It's sold out. And what'll she play? - My dream! - Ravel's Concerto. Put some life into it. Fingertips! That's good. Don't slow down. Start over. It's no good. No wrong notes this time. Go on. It's good to breathe out before you start. - Who taught you that? - You did! Go on. Problem? You ok, Fred? Need water, or help? Need water, Frédéric? He's got cold water for you. Are you fearing the birth? I understand. It can be hard. Can I show you a model? Remember, this is just a mockup of reality. You'll see a baby come out without medical assistance. I'll hide the mockup. A ventouse can help dislodge a baby. Sometimes it's not enough, so we use shoehorn salad tongs. They look a bit daunting. - Scary. - The main thing is to protect the baby's head with them. What if the placenta is stuck? We go get it. I'll show you a worst-case scenario. It happens sometimes. But rest assured, we proceed very gently to prevent excess bleeding. The midwife or obstetrician slides a hand inside you to gently unstick what remains stuck. You're anesthetized, because it's no picnic. Frédéric, are you ok? What... have I done? I assume you weren't alone. - I was! - It takes two. You were alone? You made a baby by yourself? Breathe deeply. Breathe. Don't hold your breath. Breathe out. That's it, breathe out. What's keeping Claire? We've been waiting for ages. - She's playing hard to get. - Jacqueline? Hey, my little girl. How are you in there? I want to caress her. Give her some of my warmth. I've been buying her lots of little clothes. Seems I'm bothering her. Hi sweetie, it's Grandma! I can't wait to meet you. Hello. I assume I'm seeing you two. Who are you, madam? I'm the mother. This is between the couple and their child. I wanted her to meet the baby. - You'll see them after. - Ok, I'll leave. - If I'm bothering you, I'll go. - This is about them. It's a question of roles. - Yours is different. - Ok, fine. - You're the grandmother. - Such a pity. - Your role is important too. - Sure. - Anyway, see you later. - At the café? Makes me sad though. Bye. - Why did you come today? - The lawyer told me to. - Are you two struggling? - We're separated. Right. Are you angry at Fred? But not at your child? I'm sick of lying down and being poked and groped all over. Seriously, you have no idea! I feel like an object. I can't take it any more. I'm fed the fuck up! Is that clear or is that not clear? Can I say it? Stop touching me! I've had it! I'm not a thing! Get your hand off me, please! Let go of me! Can you do that? I'm warning you. Remove your hand, please. No! Stop touching me! I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you. I'm trying to make contact. Fred, will you go over there? I'm not sure I should. Go on ahead. So, Fred, I want you to be with me. Feel the heaviness of the mattress. Feel how this mattress is carrying Claire and your child. I feel the mattress. Yes. And Claire, especially. - And Claire. - And Claire! You're feeling Claire, and you're smiling. - Yes, true. - Good. She's smiling! May I say hello to your child, or is it still too soon? May I say hello to your child? - Claire decides, right? - Of course. Yes. Say hello to your child. Your hands feel a bit heavy, a bit imposing. That's it. More rounded. More tenderly. Can you feel her responding to her father's voice? Can you look at Claire? She was looking at you, but you didn't see her. Don't forget her! She's the one who needs to feel safe and secure. Ouch! Go easy when you move! My child's beating me up. No, he's moving. You said "my child." That's good. I think we'll get up now, and go play piano. Respect the nuances. Breathe. Fingertips. Perfect. Bust a gut for me. Breathe, honey. I bust a gut! Call an ambulance! I'll call your husband too. You mustn't go alone. Hello ma'am. Hello, sir. This is Mrs. Richard Primipara. Girard! Sorry, my mistake. First pregnancy, 40th week, no contractions, water not broken, no urge to push. But her lower abdomen is tight. She says it's going to explode or burst. That's it. - Hang in there, ma'am. - We'll examine you. If you don't need to be hospitalized, you'll go home. The midwife will decide. Have you had pain during the pregnancy? I don't know. Call my husband, he'll give you all the details. He knows all there is to know about pregnancy. Ok. Can you give me his phone number? I don't know it. - I'll find it. - I'm sorry. PERINATAL WARD You ok? Did you give birth? No. Forgive me. Forgive me. Damn! Hang on. Please! You ok, ma'am? You're having a great contraction. Breathe, it'll pass. - Are you ok? - You had a huge contraction about 2 minutes ago. See? This nice curve here? That's a super contraction. Let's look at the cervix and see where we're at. Bend your knees a little. That's right. Other side too. Perfect. So, we did... - The method... - The method? - The Italian method. - I see. Ok. Here we go. May I? Take a deep breath. This'll be a bit uncomfortable. Your cervix was closed. - Now it's open 1 finger. - Great, 1 finger! - Labor has begun. - Not quite yet. But the cervix is gearing up. I won't leave this place until... I give birth. In order to induce, in theory, we need a good medical reason. You do have an enormous belly. I understand you're fed up. Your cervix is dilating. Not enough, but it's dilating. - We could induce labor. - Yeah, ok. But you need to know the risks you're taking. The main risk is aggravated by the distension of your uterus. Your uterus will be contracting for hours. Induced labor lasts about 20 hours. You risk hemorrhaging. Oh shit. The other risk is the induction fails and we have to deliver by cesarean. Ok. Thank you. I don't want her hemorrhaging. I'm the one who decides. Do you have your things? - Do we? - I brought everything. Sir, put on a blue smock. - See you in a sec. - Yeah. Hang on... I'll insert the drip. Jabbing now. - Could you spell your name? - Girard. G-I-R-A-R-D. - First name? - Claire. I'll get the midwife. This is the birthing room. Remove all your clothes. Put on the smock. Lay down on the bed. Sir, you'll have to leave for the epidural. We do it in a sterile field. Everything has to be sterile, and I'm not. As we know! About 20 minutes, sir. - Undoing the smock. - Putting on the cap. Up we go. Now move back a bit. Ok? I'm scared. Everything will be fine. I'll explain as I go along. First I'll find my marks. It's just my fingers. Could I be paralyzed for life? No, that's extremely rare now. Almost never happens. Do as we say and you'll be fine. Stay as still as you possibly can. Relax your shoulders. - Lower your head. - Don't move. - I can't stop shaking. - Trust us. I'm starting to insert the needle. You'll feel a little pressure in your back. May I? I'll just sit down. I'll break the membrane now. Let's go. I'll scratch the baby's head with this, breaking the amniotic membrane. Tell me if it hurts. Theses membranes are really resistant. There we go. - Did it rip open? - Don't ask me! Perfect. Thank you. - I'm gonna sleep. - Ok. Hello. I'm Anais, taking over for Apolline. She's delivering a baby. - What's your best guess? - For? Dilation. Uh... six? No, not six. Wrong. Same dilation as earlier. Still? Open your cervix! We'll crank up the dose for more contractions. - Oxytocin? - That's right. Good evening. I'm Isabelle, the midwife taking over for Anais. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'll examine you, ok? So now we're at... nine centimeters. No! Superb, bravo. Get some rest. You're in the home stretch. We'll set up in an hour. Are you ready? Shall we set up for delivery? Now? All of a sudden? I'm raising the table and lowering the legs. I'm taking the other leg. Need a kidney dish? I'll tell you if I feel a contraction. And you tell me if you do. Feel any contractions? I felt them earlier and now I don't anymore. I think the contractions are still too far apart. We'll wait awhile. - Really? - Just a short while, to let the baby descend a bit more. If you feel it pushing harder, call me right away. Hello, you rang? I feel it pushing down below. Isabelle's in surgery, so I'll be delivering. Ready to push? Lift your bottom. Sylvie, the stirrup. Stirrup. I don't think it'll stay up. I'm checking the presentation. This is in my way... I'll use the drape. Feel it pushing? I brought a balloon. Should I give it to her now? To help you blow continuously. - Can you reach the bars? - Are the bars good? You can grip here or there. Ok for you? Here comes a contraction. Breathe in. Go on. Bear down. Blow into the balloon. - Blow into the balloon. - Good, keep going. Bravo, that's good. Keep going. Yes, that's good! Bravo, bravo! Yes, bravo! - Bravo, honey! - I see a lock of hair. - A lock of hair? - It retracted. - I'll do it without the balloon. - No help? You can help her by propping her neck up. Don't push her. Just lift her, support her. And make her laugh! It helps the baby descend. Every time you laugh, it descends. Two sheep... I mean two elephants are on the edge of a swamp, right? One of them has her period. She says to her friend, "I'm bleeding, I can't stop the flow!" And her friend says, "Just stick a sheep in it, like I do." - Good one. - I don't get it. - A whole sheep? - Yeah, they use sheep. Very good. Here comes a contraction. Take a deep breath... and push. Keep going, keep going... You're doing great. Look. Keep going. Beautiful. Keep going. Give me one more. Your baby's coming. Keep pushing. Yes! Go ahead. Yes, fabulous. Breathe out. - Can you still push? - Dunno... Let's go, it's moving down again. Push, push. Harder! Harder! Yes, that's great. Push some more. Wonderful. Breathe out. It's not moving now, it's staying put. That was a lie, it's retracting now. What's that mean? Push harder next time. It doesn't like the spot it's in. I feel one coming. Give me 200%. Push as hard as you can. Come on, come on... That's it, keep going... Beautiful. Keep it up. Push, push... Don't stop now, keep going. Push. You're doing great. Can you turn the heartbeat up? I love that little sound. Let's go. Take a deep breath and exhale as you push. Bear down. Hard as you can. Keep going. - Keep going. - Almost there. Take a break. This is exhausting. Do you want to film the birth? Want Sylvie to take photos? - Here comes a contraction. - Hang on. Quick, give her the camera! I'm not much of a photographer. Just press the dot. Push and breathe. Perfect. Stop pushing. Stop pushing. The head is out. Here we go. Let's go. Let's push for the shoulder. - Let's push for the shoulder. - Breathe in. Push for the shoulder. That's it. Beautiful. Poor thing had the cord around its neck. That explains everything. I'm taking its little head... Releasing the shoulder... I'm taking care not to damage the perineum. Here's your phone back. Come, sir. Reach out your arms, ma'am. Reach out your arms, you two. Sir, reach out. Come closer. Release your wife's neck. That's right. Under the armpits. That's right. Pull, both of you. Bravo! There. So what have we here? Can you see? It's a boy. Not a girl? He's worn out from the birth. Sylvie will take him. Sir, you can go with Sylvie. This is not unusual. They can struggle at first. - Can I touch him? - Sure, he's your baby. - You'll get the hang of it. - This is so crazy. The placenta is out now. Your baby is just fine. - Really? - Yes, he's with his dad. He's looking after him. Tending to his first needs. They're beautiful together. Everything's just fine. Madam? There's a trickle of blood at the level of the uterus. We're doing a uterine curettage, scraping your uterus to get the last chunk of placenta and stop the bleeding. Here's your baby. Are you ok? I'll give him to you. Here's your little baby. Look. He's opening his eyes. Hello... - Hello. - Hello, ma'am. Ms. Girard has arrived. Thank you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hi, I'm Claire Girard. I'm late. - Go on in, they're expecting you. - Thanks. Subtitles by Sionann O'Neill Subtitling TITRAFILM
