- Sir. - Hmm? They are here. \{In Mandarin\} \{In Mandarin\} Welcome to brother's country. Hello, General. You haven't fulfilled your promise. Every dollar you gave has been spent in preparation for the war. And we shall continue to do so. \{In Mandarin\} Trust me. Once these planes reach East Pakistan, our enemy will lose both, its land and its people. Pakistan and China are poised to emerge victorious in this war. General, We want results... And you have to curb the upheaval in East Pakistan. You know the consequences otherwise. I will. I'll take care of it. 'Following their defeats in '48 and '65' 'Pakistan was devising a grand plan this time,' 'and we were completely oblivious of their intentions.' 'Majumdar and I had been stationed in East Pakistan by Indian Intelligence,' 'and neither he nor his camera could avert their gaze from the ongoing affairs here.' In order to get a Bengali PM in Islamabad, I... Run! Run! 'Pakistan was killing its own people.' 'And amidst the barbarism,' 'death, and destruction, The people's only hope was...' 'India.' 'While utilizing bullets to suppress the revolt brewing locally,' 'our adversary, in collaboration with China,' 'was plotting to wage a war against us.' Hey! Who are you? Come on. - Hello? - Sir. Our Bengali Babu got caught. With their military secrets? Yes, sir. Can you bring him back? j&Come closer to me,j& j&And into my ears whisper,j& j&Whatever you desire--j& Sir. Some singer you are, huh? Wore this uniform to sing their songs, hmm? Apologies, sir. If you so desire to sing, sing the songs of your country's glory. "My longing comes to my lips as a supplication of mine," "Blessed be my sacred land, Pakistan," Our national anthem? Can't you sing this instead? Sir. How will you hate Indira if you are in love with Lata and Asha, huh? Apologies, sir. You are free to pursue your hobbies, but your country always comes first. Yes, sir. Now tell me, where have you kept that Indian? In there, sir. Has he opened his pie hole yet? Negative, sir. But his other hole is wide open. - Explain. - He's got diarrhea. Bloody Indians, they start shitting in their pants as soon as they enter Pakistan. Get him. I don't follow, sir. His transfer documents. Major has gone on rounds. Can we wait till he returns, sir? These orders come from his superiors. Execute them. Yes, sir. 'Major is on his way back with the supplies.' 'Prepare for unloading.' Copy, sir. Let me go. Let me go. Come on. Stop it. Stand still. If he doesn't cooperate, just shoot this... Bengali Babu. Bengali Babu... Operation East over. I knew you'd come to my rescue. My reels? They have it. They are of utmost importance. Who are you, officer? What are you doing in this camp? First, you tell me, what is Ghalib doing in a Pakistan Army Camp? How will we win the war if our officers are in love with their poets? Where are you from? From Pakistan - body, mind, and soul. Which Province? Sindh? - Punjab. - No. You are from India. You are a Muslim from India. As per your dialect. Good guess. You are right. My father fell in love with my mother who hailed from Lucknow. I guess my mother's influence is reflecting. It is against protocol to enter a Major's camp without permission. And as per protocol, I can shoot you. - Yes, you can. - Identify yourself. Which regiment are you from? Grandfather - Abbas Beg, British Army. Father - Hasan Beg, Pakistan Army, Nishaan-e-Haidar, '48. Uncle - Wasim Beg, Sitara-e-Jurat, '65. Third generation soldier, Major Qamar Beg. Sir? Please come in. He is the soldier, who forgot to pack the reels along with the important documents. - Reels, sir? - Yes. There were supposed to be some reels along with the important documents. And I am not talking about your song reels. Are you aware of the talent he possesses? He is a great singer. Thank you, sir. Shut up. These reels, sir? Thank you. - Don't make this mistake again. - Sir. Major, I share the opinion that breaking protocol is a criminal offense. Hence I gave him the official orders before I came in. Yes, sir. Sir. Major Qamar Beg. Punjab Regiment. Major Mushtaq. Goodbye. Goodbye. Officer... Your Identity Card. Thank you. Soldier, you'll get to sing the National Anthem in Islamabad on 14th August. Yes, sir. - Dev. - Sir. What perils can we expect? Sir. The signs from East Pakistan are not good. They fortified the airfield facility in Lalmonirhat. There is an anti-aircraft battery establishment in Rangpur. New base camps were established in Saidpur and Dinajpur. Sir, what's most concerning is that they have also established 10 new runways. What could be their aim behind it? The ever-changing situation in East Pakistan. Or another war with India. War? No. They themselves are on the brink of a civil war. Will they be able to wage a war against us under these circumstances? Absolutely not. So, we should not worry then. It would be unwise to disregard Pakistan's inherent nature, sir. Even when buried six feet under, they won't miss an opportunity to get a hand out, just to throw a stone at India. Mr. Avasti, they are busy killing their own people in East Pakistan. Keep an eye out. We'll respond at the first sign of danger. I'll update the Defense Minister. Greetings Sir. A man manages to infiltrate our East Pakistan army and our intelligence is fast asleep. Shame on us! Who was he? An Indian agent, sir... What were you doing? Who is there? We are investigating, sir. Afsal, understand carefully, we won't tolerate any security lapse. 10 days. Make sure nothing happens in the next 10 days that puts India on high alert, and ruins our plan. Remember that. This Palestinian plane was hijacked. It helped Palestine's fight for freedom, made headlines across the world. So? So, JKLF's leader Maqbool Bhat is planning to do something similar. He wants Kashmir's fight for freedom to make headlines across the world. I'll shove the very plane down your throat! There must be no activities against India for the next 10 days. Maqbool Bhat isn't interested in joining India or Pakistan. He wants Kashmir as an autonomous territory. He won't listen to us. Stop him. Make sure he doesn't get any help. Sir! You are back. How are you doing, Maratha Warrior? I am fine, sir. Still waiting for my first case. Sir, have some, please. - Laddoos. [sweets] - Hmm. My wife sent them. She is the one who is pregnant, but I am the one being pampered. You are lucky. I'll say I am lucky when I'll get to work on a case with you. Dev sir. We have received a message from an agent in West Pakistan. 10 days. 40 planes. With... China. Yes, sir. They plan to attack us after 10 days. If China is with them then we'll be attacked from two sides. From the East Front, sir. That's not a good sign. Sir, that army movement is for us, and not for East Pakistan. This means they are well-prepared, and we are not. And we have only 10 days. 'We weren't ready for this sudden war.' 'Only a few of our soldiers were guarding the borders of East Pakistan and China.' 'The Indian Forces were focused on protecting the borders of West Pakistan,' 'but the enemy had already established themselves on the East Front.' 'The military planes stationed in West Pakistan' 'were set to traverse through Indian airspace' 'in order to reach East Pakistan,' 'as it was the solitary means for Pakistan to access its other side.' 'China and Pakistan were all set to strike India as soon as the planes got there.' The North eastern States were about to break away from India. We were in deep trouble. How much time do you need to prepare? Two months, sir. But sir, the attack is possible at any moment after the next 10 days. Then how will we stop Pakistan and China in the East? Sir, with your permission? We can stop them, sir. How? By blocking our airspace. This will not only give us two months to prepare, but also slow them down. Please elaborate. Sir, India has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. By law, planes require a flight permit to fly over the airspace belonging to our country. They won't be able to fly over if we block our airspace. Then we won't permit them to fly over. It's not that easy, sir. According to the Tashkent Agreement signed by former Prime Minister Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri, we can only do that if we are at war. But our enemy is going to attack us. Yes, sir. But technically, we aren't at war. Sir, India could face international restrictions for blocking the airspace without any reason. We cannot just stand here and do nothing. Sir, I know it is difficult to block airspace, but we don't have any other options. Dev. We will have to drop the idea of blocking the airspace, because the circumstances are not ideal. - But, sir... - That's it. Find a solution to this problem as soon as possible. I have good news, sir. As per the reports we got, India is not ready for a war. Soon, this sky will witness the victory, East Pakistan will bring us. Dev sir! Sir. May I? You got a new case. How did you guess, sir? Congratulations. This is not fair, sir. I cannot even share this good news with my own family. Protocol. I am supposed to celebrate alone. Have some, sir. What's the case? Not anything big like yours. I just need to keep a watch. On whom? A 17-year-old Kashmiri boy. Qasim Qureshi. 'Perhaps got brainwashed by our neighbors.' What has he done? He was caught with a gun, sir. A 17-year-old carrying a gun, sir? - Look straight ahead. - You think he can pull this off, Maqbool Saab? Straight head. He's like a boil, he has a soft exterior that conceals the toxicity within. Fire. Good job. He will do the job. - 'He must be a new recruit of ISI.' - Uh-uh. He belongs to the Azad Kashmir Organization. They had planned something big. We'll free Kashmir just like the Palestinians freed their country, my brother, Qasim. Maqbool Bhai, I will do whatever it takes. You just have to give orders. They were going to hijack the plane carrying Rajiv, Mrs. Indira's son. He is currently in police custody. What is the problem then? Two more people were supposed to execute this plan with him. Now, Qasim has decided to become an approver So the police are placing him at the airport to identify the other two. As a policeman? Yes, sir. They cannot hijack the plane anymore. We just need to arrest the other two. We should strip not just the land, but also the sky away from such people. Thanks. What is wrong with you?! We have already discussed this. Airspace block is impossible. - It is possible, sir. - How? Pakistan will make it possible. And why will Pakistan do that? We will make Pakistan to do that. You think Pakistan is stupid enough to dig its own grave? I am confident about it, sir. I have a plan. Your plan... it's easy to say but difficult to execute. Only the Defense Ministry has the authority to block the airspace. That's why I think your plan is impossible. Guru Gobind Singh didn't think it was impossible to make one warrior fight 125,000. Lord Rama didn't think it was impossible to fight Ravana with an army of monkeys. Maharana Pratap didn't think it was impossible to fight the Mughal Empire by himself. We are their decedents, We should never dismiss anything as impossible. Sir, if we manage to pull this off, we can not only save our nation but also prevent the loss of human lives in East Pakistan. I need permission, sir. Dev? Do you really think Pakistan is so stupid? No sir, but I think we can outsmart them. - Sir, excuse me. - Sir. This could be the first time in history that such an operation is being executed... And that too in just nine days! That's how history is created. Good evening. Passengers traveling to Delhi are requested to proceed towards the gate. Thank you. Passengers traveling to Delhi are requested to proceed towards the gate. Thank you. Be alert. It's time to put all your senses to work. Look over there.. Hmm? Sir. Three flights take off from this airport every alternate day. To Chandigarh in the morning. Anyone there? To Jammu in the afternoon. And to New Delhi in the evening. Look outside as well. Do you see anyone? Look there. Over there. No. Any of these people? Check properly. No sir, they are not here. Did you see properly? Believe me sir, I wouldn't have let them go, if they were here. Let's go. Qasim won't be able to hijack the plane, but he can lead us to the other two hijackers. Come here, boy. Yes, sir? Keep in mind, if you try to pull any tricks on me, I'll make you regret it. Got it? Trust me, sir, I'll lead you to the hijackers for sure. I promise, sir. His body language suggests that he is scared. He seems that way but not quite. Drive. Qasim? You started working? How responsible of you! I wouldn't have to do this if you had fulfilled your responsibility. What happened? What happened, you ask? You old farts are good for nothing but smoking hookahs... ...Nothing else. Carry on, carry on. What happened? Do you really expect us to take up a vain job like you, that too at this age, huh? We didn't find any leads today. The individuals that Qasim interacts with tomorrow, and his actions should lead us to our next breakthrough. 'We had reached Kashmir,' 'but the local police were oblivious to our plans.' 'That left us without any assistance or support from them.' 'Therefore, we had to work alone to stop this war with the help of Qasim.' You too go and watch the film with him. Good morning. Passengers traveling to Jammu are requested to proceed towards the gate. Good morning. Passengers traveling to Jammu are requested to proceed towards the gate. Thank you. I was the one who arrested Qasim, sir. But we were unable to get any leads on the other two hijackers. How many times will you watch this film? He is crazy. Absolutely crazy. He wouldn't think about hijacking a plane if he was normal. Dev, we are running out of time. Ministry is questioning me. It shouldn't be that they attack us while we are still pursuing leads. Thank you. How many times do you plan to watch this five-year-old film? Just do your duty, old man. He has lost his mind. You still don't understand this film even after watching it these many times? You don't understand what I want. You should try to understand what we want as well. You keep watching the same film again and again. This is what I wanted to show you. Memorise everything. This is a plane. And this is how you sit in a plane. The pilot's cockpit is up at the front. Upon boarding the plane, you'll notice two seats on each side of the row, with a gallery in the middle. Qasim, will our plane... Will our plane be the same? This is what I wanted to show you. We found one. You follow him. I'll find out who the other hijacker is. Okay, sir. Plan to get down on your own, or are you waiting for the heroine to give you a hand? What is wrong with the youth of today? Bloody slackers! He stays in a houseboat at Dal Lake. His name is Ashfaq. He is Qasim's first cousin. That's all I could find out. Sangram, Qasim doesn't go to the theatre to watch the film. He goes there to brief Ashfaq on planes. This isn't just a plane. This is Kashmir's freedom. This is an altitude indicator. It will tell you how high the plane is flying. And this here is the fuel indicator. Crazy boy. You are just a kid. First, learn how to operate it. Don't ever make the mistake of considering me a kid, Or else I'll make you regret it. Got it? Hello? Jai Hind, sir. Ganga? But Ganga has been decommissioned, sir. It's a piece of junk. Okay, sir. Ganga will be ready. Ganga? Strange. - Sir. - Dev, we have identified that decommissioned aero plane. Any clue on the hijackers? Not yet, sir. But we do have a lead. We are quite close to nabbing them, sir. Five days is all we have, before the risk of an attack becomes inevitable. Meet Maqbool Bhai's cousin at the Dal Market, give him this chit, and collect a gun from him. Gun? Bang-bang-bang! Yes, brother, a gun. Bang-bang-bang! Don't worry, brother. There is no room for mistakes, Ashfaq. The film gave you a glimpse of what the inside of a plane looks like. Now, let me tell you the plan. Look, you will be here, in the cabin, handling the passengers. And I... Put it down. I will be in the cockpit. I'll be pointing the gun, that you brought, at the pilot's head and ask him to go towards Rawalpindi. We will land in Rawalpindi, and let the world know about our fight for freedom. Come on, let's kidnap a plane. It's 'hijack', not kidnap. Sir, couldn't Ashfaq find any other place to get the gun? Gun peddler. Police too have been following him. What are they doing here, sir? Someone must have tipped them off. Our plan will fall through if Ashfaq gets caught. You watch over Qasim. Catch him! Over there! Go, go, go! Surround him! Go from the other side. What are you doing? Hurry up! Give it here. Get him as well. Don't let them get away. Who are you? I am also a soldier of Azad Kashmir, just like you. Hurry up! Faster! Faster! He is getting away! Catch him! Hurry up! Stop him! Go, go, go! Bloody rascals! Stop! Don't spare him! Hit him! Catch him! Hey! Damn it! He's getting away! Over here! Thank you. Goodbye. Hello? We are ready, sir. Go ahead. Oh God, please keep them safe. Who were they? Not they, Qasim. Just one person. - Just one person? - Yes, brother. He said... he is a fellow comrade. Only god knows what would've happened if he had not saved my life. It's all thanks to Maqbool Bhai. But Qasim, how will we hijack the plane without a gun? The first flight tomorrow. May God be with you. See you in Pakistan. Jaan, these fake... It's all thanks to Maqbool Bhai, brother. This is an outrageous plan. We'll get our own plane hijacked? Mr. Avasti, This plan is a suicide mission. There will be civilians on that plane. We cannot risk their lives for this mission. Sir, all the passengers on that plane will be our agents. What if Pakistan finds out our true identity and attack us? You still won't fight back. Entering enemy grounds without a weapon... It's like signing our death warrant. I agree. But if we carry weapons, Pakistan will be able to prove that it was an Indian conspiracy, and we will lose this war. You are Indian passengers, and no matter what, you'll be just passengers. Our mission is to go to Pakistan and stop them. Mr. Avasti, a single mistake, and our government will be answerable to the nation. Sir, this hijack will be an act of terrorism by Pakistan. An act of terrorism is an act of war. We will use this international rule to stop Pakistan's fleet from flying over, and protect our States in the Northeast. Fine. We will go with you. But... how will we return home? Indian High Commission will help us. I want our 30 agents back, safe and sound. Do what you must. The first flight tomorrow... to Lahore. - Jai Hind. - Jai Hind. Sir. Qasim and his cousin Ashfaq are going to hijack a plane. Should I kill them? No. It will only make things worse. And we don't want that. Sir. Someone is helping them. Listen carefully, Sikander. Don't let this hijacking happen at any cost. Okay, sir. I'll see to it that no plane takes off. - Greetings. - Greetings. Sir, can I have the one... printed on this pamphlet? Here you go. Amazing. It's a beauty. It looks so real. Do you have anything deadlier, sir? I'd made a couple of grenades, but they didn't sell well. I'll take those as well. Whom do you plan to scare? I rather not say. Just keep your ears glued to the transistor. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. Ma'am, I want 3 tickets for Jammu. Sorry, sir. All flights to Jammu are full. Oh. Come on, let's find another mode of transportation. Stop! I said stop! Hey! Who are you? Why are you following him? Let me go. Please give me a ticket for Jammu. Quickly. Excuse me? Please hurry. Sure. - Your name? - My name is Sheila. - Thank you. - Thank you. Let's go. Two tickets for Jammu. The first flight out is for Jammu, right? Yes. Okay. - Your name? - Ash... A. Qureshi. Q. Qureshi. Thank you, ma'am. Good morning. Passengers traveling to Jammu are requested to proceed towards the gate. Thank you. Good morning. Passengers traveling to Jammu are requested to proceed towards the gate. Thank you. No. No, sir. None of them. Check properly. Sir... I need to go pee. Let the plane take off first. I'll wet my pants before the plane takes off. Fine. Go. None of them. Ashfaq. I am nervous. Gun? I am very scared, Qasim. I am scared. If you look scared, Not only will you get caught, you will also get me killed. - No. - Gun. Go, guard the door. Sorry, Jaan. Morning, Captain. Let's head to Lahore. Captain, the doors are closed and secured. Thank you, Kiran. Has Sangram reported in yet? No, sir. VT-DMA 1-2-3 ready for departure. Requesting permission to take off. VT-DMA, clear for take-off. Runway 24. Good luck. - Hello? How did civilians get into that plane? How many civilians? Where is Dev? Has the plane taken off? Not a good situation. Not a good situation. The Telephone lines are not fixed yet? No, sir. Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. May I have your kind attention, please? We will be landing in Jammu in the next 20 minutes. Thank you. - Hijack! - Hijack! - Hijack! - Hijack! - Hijack! - Hijack! This plane has been hijacked. Sit down! Don't move! Nobody moves! Remain seated! You... Get down. Sit down! Sit down! Nobody say a word. Anyone who acts smart will be blown apart. No, no! If you don't believe me, then look at this! Nobody move! Do as we say, or I will shoot everyone of you. Keep an eye. No talking! Take the plane to Pakistan. My comrade will start killing your passengers if you don't do as I say. Turn it around. Land the plane at Rawalpindi Airport. That is not possible. Our plane doesn't have enough fuel. (Kashmiri) You cannot say no to me! Shut up. We will crash midway if we try to land it in Rawalpindi. I don't believe you. Shoe me the fuel indicator? I don't care, Turn the plane. Turn it around now! Keep heading straight. Keep heading straight... to Rawalpindi! Keep heading straight. We don't have enough fuel. Rawalpindi! We can only fly for 7 more minutes. Rawalpindi!!! This plane will crash if we don't land it right away. I don't care! Keep flying! Keep flying! We will all die... including you! Fine, land it. Land it here on my head. It is the closest. Lahore. What? What did you say? Lahore is quite close. It will only take us 6 minutes to land. Lahore! Land the plane in Lahore. Land it quickly. Ashfaq. Have we reached Rawalpindi? No, we haven't. What happened? These idiots don't have enough fuel to get us to Rawalpindi! Now what? Now what? Now we'll have to land in Lahore. Lahore works. We'll be in Pakistan at least. Go, keep an eye on them. Okay. Were we informed of any flight diversions? No, sir. Good afternoon, this is Lahore Tower. Requesting status of your flight, Captain. This is Indian airplane flight VT-DMA Ganga. We have been hijacked. Requesting permission for emergency landing. I repeat we have been hijacked. Hijack! Hijack! Indian flight hijacked! We are on minimum fuel. I repeat, we are on minimum fuel. We cannot help you. You are requested to turn around and go back. We cannot go back. We have to land. It's not an option. Captain. Give that to me. Let me talk to them. Give it here. Listen you, I am a soldier of Azad Kashmir. We won't turn around. Sir, I request you to... Do you want me to shoot the pilot? Do you? Captain, you are not allowed to land. We are at gunpoint, sir. The fuel tank is empty. Our plane will crash if we don't land. We have to land. We are landing. - Hello? - Apron control, block the runway right away. Unauthorized aircraft trying to land. I repeat, block runway. Abort landing! Abort! Left engine failure. Allow me to land. Do you plan to land on these vehicles? Move! Back up! Go, go, go! Move! Hello? Ganga has landed in Lahore. Hello! Hello! Yes, I can hear you. Then listen and listen carefully. There are 30 Indians on this plane. We will release them only after the Indian Government releases our 36 National Front Activists. Neither this plane nor the people inside will survive if our demands are not met. Do you understand? Sir, your demands can be met only by the Indian Government. And you are currently in Pakistan. We will need some time. Fine. But I want a quick response. - Palestine... - Keep quiet. Shut up. Zip it. What about Palestine? Palestine what? - Tell me. - It's nothing. It's not nothing. Palestine what? They are our brothers. Tell me. Speak up. A similar hijacking took place to free Palestine. So? Those hijackers said they'd only speak to government officials, and not such ordinary airport authorities. India is a big country. And he doesn't have the authority to talk to a big country like India. Then who has the authority? President of Pakistan. Or a minister. Someone who can talk to India directly. Only then will you be able to get your job done. Hello! Hello! Listen to me. I told you to give us some time. Are you, the president of Pakistan? You are not, so listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to the President of Pakistan, or a Pakistani Government official right now. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.' 'News updates from Radio Pakistan, Lahore.' Indian Aircraft Ganga which was hijacked by two Kashmiri boys has landed at Lahore Airport. It has been hijacked by two Kashmiri boys. The President of Pakistan has tasked Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to address this matter as soon as possible. How did Maqbool Bhat pull this off? Where is Sikander! - Hello? - Afsal. - Sir. - You will pay for this. Now listen carefully. Sir. The hijackers have made their demands. They want us to release 36 National Liberation Front prisoners. Okay. Put Indian High Commission on hold. Let's lie low till the Pakistani Government doesn't comment on it. - Sir! - Sir! - Mr. Bhutto! - Mr. Bhutto! - Sir! - Sir!

They did? So quickly? They don't have any other option, sir. But... they accepted defeat so easily? Why? Indian High Commission. We have reached the negotiation stage. How did India let this hijack happen? Is this an attempt to prove that Pakistan supports terrorism? Or is it a conspiracy to malign our reputation on a global scale? Sir. Why did that plane land here then? They want to stop our planes. - I don't understand, sir. - But they certainly do. They know that we are ready for war. They know the only way we can get to East Pakistan is by using... The Indian Airspace. They are going to use this hijacking as an excuse to block their airspace. But how can they do this? They can only do this after we declare war against them. The hijacked plane that is currently in our country will be considered an act of war. - Pakistan chants with pride, - Kashmir is our birthright! - Pakistan chants with pride, - Kashmir is our birthright! Anything could happen to us now. They have come to detain us under a pretext. All of you are requested to leave your bags behind and come with me. Please hurry. Let's go. India has accepted the demands made by Azad Kashmir. The preparation to send these 30 Indians back will begin tomorrow. Until then, we will perform our duty as good neighbors and hosts. Have a good day. - Sir! - Sir! What will be your next step? No more comments, please. No more comments. We are supposed to travel back by plane... - On what? - On the plane. This bus here is for you.

There could be more than one agent here. Oh.. Either they will do something here, or they will get external help. We will have to catch them red-handed. We will need a backup force, sir. The backup force will be there soon. You should personally brief them. - Sir. - Remember, we need concrete evidence. Then we can take action against India for violating Pakistani territory. They all will be executed in a public hanging. Sir. They are under police protection. They are treating them like they are more than just passengers. So, they are suspicious. It means it won't be easy for them to get out of there. Mansoor. I want more security at the main gate. And clear this entry point. Lock the gates right away. Yes, sir. Pilot! Where's the pilot of that plane? He's an Indian Agent. Good. Now we have concrete evidence. What is the Pilot's room number? 270, sir. What is the matter? Not this one, sir. Open the door! Open the door now! Come on out! Come on out now! Open the door! Who is in there? How many people are in there? Open the door! Open the door! Step outside, everyone. Stand in a line. Stand straight. Stand still. You made a big mistake by coming here. What are you talking about? Really? Let me jog your memory. Recognize this blood? It belongs to your friend, Agent Sangram. I killed him and threw his body in the river Jhelum. But I will be burying you right here. Don't do anything stupid, Just come with us, Agent. Mansoor. Keep an eye on all of them. We will skin each of them alive. Yes, sir. No one out there knows what transpired here. - Are you okay? - Yes. We need to leave immediately. No.. Not immediately. We need to stick to the plan. We will leave tomorrow when the police shift changes. The Pakistani Government is only pretending to be a good host. They doubt us, and they want to expose us. But... we will expose them instead. - Chief is on the move. - Okay, sir. Sir. The power will be restored in some time. Okay. I am going to the Ganda Singh border with the Chief. Update the SI during the shift change. Okay, sir. Sir. Done. Sir, this is the coded message Dev sent us last night. Orders to Hussaini... Shift change 07:00 am. Hussainiwala border aka Ganda Singh border. Imperial Hotel. Send the orders to the Hussainiwala border. Immediately. Sir. Where's SI Mansoor? He left for the Ganda Singh border along with the Chief Afsal Aga at dawn. This is the message he had asked me to convey. Good day, sir. Good day. They have been under your custody? I just took charge, sir. Hello, sir. Is there a problem? Why is there so much security here? There is no problem. They are here for your protection. Oh. For our journey then. We have been waiting for you. We are ready. Let's board the bus then. Wait. Why would you board the bus? You are here to take us home, right? No. We didn't receive any such orders. Please go back to your rooms. Please. But sir, that officer had asked us to be ready. He said the army officers would be here in the morning to escort us to the border. - Where is the Chief? - Sir. He left for the Ganda Singh border. I wasn't informed about this. - When did he leave? - At dawn. But they have all gathered here for a reason. You should've known as to when and how are they leaving. Sir, I... Why are you still here? Please go. Please go back to your rooms. We have received no such orders yet. We will inform you once we get them. Back to your rooms. Please. Please go. Why are you not leaving? - Hello? - Imperial Hotel? Yes. There must be some officers standing there. I would like to talk to them. Call for you, sir. Hello? The President wants to know, have the 30 Indians staying in this hotel left for the Ganda Singh Checkpost? - What, sir? - President's orders are that you escort the 30 Indians staying in this hotel to the Ganda Singh Checkpost right away. Who is this? His PA. Hello? Hello? Hello? - What is it? - One man is missing, sir. - What? - One man is missing. Do a head count. Quick, quick. Check the register again. 15, 16, 17, 18 19, 20, 21, 22 23, 24, 25, 26 27, 28, 29... Check all the rooms. Quick. Yes, sir. - Where were you? - I was just checking out the hotel, sir. Get on the bus. Hurry up. Yes, okay, okay. Sir. All clear, sir. Everyone's been accounted for. - Everyone's been accounted for? - Yes, sir. Get the buses on the road. - Hello? - Jai Hind, sir. All our civilians and agents have safely crossed the border, sir. Sir, we have done it. Sir, they just... You idiots! Why did you bring this plane here? You thought you could defeat India with this toy? Shove it down your throat and... - We want our 36 Kashmiri brethren... - Shut up. Your 36 brethren will now rot in Indian prisons forever, and you will not be able to do anything about it. 'If they don't meet our demands,' 'we'll burn this plane down.' You bastards! What have you done? Good morning. It's time for today's news updates. Indian Aircraft Ganga which was hijacked and flown to Pakistan was burnt down at Lahore Airport. The Indian Government claims that Pakistan burnt down the Indian property to destroy evidence, which is an act of war. The Indian Government has decided to indefinitely ban overflights of Pakistani aircraft over the Indian territory citing security concerns. Now, what if we breach this airspace block? Mr. President, India has these surface-to-air missiles. They will shoot our planes down if we violate the ban. 'Pakistan tried to claim that the hijacking was an Indian conspiracy,' 'but failed to prove it.' 'The air space ban significantly weakened' 'West Pakistan troop movement into erstwhile East Pakistan.' 'On 3rd December 1971,' 'Pakistan went to war against India,' 'and in a mere 13 days, India defeated Pakistan' 'and got their entire East Pakistan army to surrender.' 'Their attempt was to severe our North Eastern states,' 'But we ended up breaking Pakistan into two' 'and creating a new country, Bangladesh from their East Pakistan.'
