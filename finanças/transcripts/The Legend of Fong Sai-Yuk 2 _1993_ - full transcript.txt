Seeing each other off in the mountains... The sunset sheds its shadow on the door. The grass will be greener than ever in the year to come. But when will Sai Yuk be back? - Mom... - Run, son! Run! l'll be struck by lightning if l run! l'm coming. lnvisible Fists! Mom, it hurts. You should be grateful to me! l tool them all! Don't hit my mom. You only care for your mom. You never cared for me. Bravo... l do wish that my people will always be that happy! Sai Yuk, don't you think we are very lucky? Of course! That's because you have me. Fuck off, damn monk! Go away! l'm just begging for alms! Get out of here! There's nothing for you here! Don't you understand? Reverend Faha, long time no see! He is my guest. May you be blessed! l'll go prepare some vegetarian food. Why do you kneel? - Reverend! - Please! What's wrong with me? l wonder who did that? Please help yourself, Reverend. May you be blessed! My young man, you have a most handsome face... you'll be rich and famous before you're thirty. - Really? - Of course! l'm good at fortune-telling. You are both mature and elegant. You'll bring wealth and good luck to your husband. You'll bear two children, a boy and a girl. Didn't you hear, Sai Yuk? Only two? Don't worry. You'll be different. You'll have two boys and two girls. How wonderful! Are you sure you're telling the truth, Reverend? Monks don't tell lies. Do they? Tingting... - Help yourself, Reverend. Be my guest. - Thank you. Tingting! My young man, remember... your life will be full of romances. What romance? My godson's no romantic person, how come he'll lead a romantic life? Watch out, Mister, your face is clouded by evil spirits. l never belief in such things. You must belief me, Mister. Can l read your palm? All right. Study it well. Pardon me, your Highness. What a bad joke, Reverend? Aren't you the Emperor? But your palm... lt's the palm of an emperor. Ah Fu, carry him. Yes, my Lady. My son, there're too many evil plotters in the Palace. Ah Fu will take you to Japan to seek the help of Mr. Yu, Chief of the Red Flower Society. From now on, your name will be Chan Jialuo. lnside this Sacred Box, you'll find a letter which will proof your real identity. l'll determine whether you'll return to China or not. Over there. You leaked Heaven's secret, aren't you afraid of being punished? What is my life is my words... can save yours? Remember, the most dangerous persons... are always the ones who're closest to you. But the person to save your life is also the one who's closed to you. l'll warn you. Now that l'm all on my own... and with my Dad being away... you must not take advantage of me. Why must l? You're dearest to me. l don't believe it, unless you... What? No, l can't say it in public. l'm embarrassed. No one will hear. We're up here! Are you sure? l know you won't say it. l'll never talk to you anymore. Come on! l love you! You're not being sincere. l love you... l want more passion! l love you... - More passion! - More passion! l love you! This is illegal! How about... me and this lady? You're nuts. l like you even better. Sai Yuk, give him a slap! This is not nice. What isn't nice? Slap him in the face! - Okay! - Slap me! l'll do it! Don't you dare? Men don't hit women! Young Master! The Master wants you. Go ahead! Your father is looking for you. Send him my regards. You're excused. l'll remember this! Don't remember it for long. Let's go! Move! ''The Dragon Soars!'' Watch out, Reverend. Reverend! Reverend! Someone attacked godfather! l'll go and see what happened. Great! l love fighting. Tingting, he's yours! Got him! Hold on! Still wanna play? The sword! Here! After them! Wait! Watch out! There may be a trap. Brothers, let's go back to the headquarters. Welcome, Chief... l thank you for hard work during my leave. Let's hear the business of our various enterprises. Some reports, please. Chief, we developed a fishing ground near the seaside... Made quite some money. Good! The pigs in our farm... each has give breed to 20 or more piggies. Not bad at all. l truly feel that the Red Flower Society is like a family. Chief, the land we brought last year... Chief, let's have a celebration party for our good business. No! This is the result of the hard work of the people. There's a flood in the east. Let's donate these monies to the refuge. l wonder how much time it'll take me to be Chief? You wanna be Chief? lt's a hell of a job. lt's worth it. What dignity and prestige! Chief, may l have the honour of your naming my new-born kid? l've been waiting for your return. No problem. What a lovely kid! Taian sounds like a good name. lt means prosperity and wealth. l hope he'll bring the same to all of us. Thank you, Chief. You won't live to see that! Assassin! Get her! Don't let her go. Don't kill her. Excuse me for being late, Chief. Please pardon me. Why did Mrs. Zhang have to kill me? Chief, she's not Mrs. Zhang. l've never seen her before. Mr. Yu, you should have known very well. How come a stranger could get into our place? What are you implying? Yotong, let's expose his conspiracy. Let's play no more games with him. The assassin was sent by him. This is a most slanderous attack! Don't you deny! You're jealous of Chief because your father chose him, instead of you, as Chief of the Red Flower Society. Fuck you! What? Shut up! Over aim is to overthrow the Manchu and restore the Ming Dynasty. We mustn't kill each other. They are against each other. Honestly, which side do you support? l couldn't care less. l stand in the middle. You're a time-server! Thank you very much. l value my life. Safely first. My compliment! Chief, to prove my innocence... l'd rather die. l trust you! Your father is most virtuous person. lt isn't possible that you, being his son, are a traitor. Brothers, l swear that l'll kill the conspirator... if l ever find out who he is. Dad... she's bleeding. Shut up! Go home. Wait! Kid, you know this woman? Yes. She gave me a kite. She asked me to bring her in. Brothers, don't you see now? ln this case, l'll just have to kill him. Are you mad? He's your son! You wanna kill a kid? Who are you? You don't know me? l'm Canton's Young Man of the Year... and Chan Jialuo's favourite godson... Fong Sai Yuk! Do you know me then? Yes. You're a beast! Kneel! Behave yourself! How can you talk to Mr. Yu like this? Don't you know our regulations? No. l only know that this kid is innocent. Well, in this case, Guobang... Chief, l'm not in this... Tell him our regulations. No problem. Make sure that he remembers. Yes. Listen to the Ten Commandments! 1. Thou shalt not betray the Chief! 2. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 3. Thou shalt not steal... 4. Thou shalt not gamble. l was just trying to save the kid. l've done nothing wrong. l don't wanna listen to these. 8. Thou shalt not insult the Chief. 9. Thou shalt no seduce your brother's wife. 10. Thou shalt not conspire against others. You must remember these Ten Commandments. They sound very familiar to the Ten Commandments of the Bible. Oh, the Old Mr. Yu was a religious man. That's why he adopted these as our regulations. No one can ever carry them out. Not even Jesus! You son of a bitch! You're insulting my father! He's just a kid! Let him go! So he's a kid! That's why Chan Jialuo asked you to teach him, right! lt's just too obvious that he wants to protect him. Bullshit! You're the one that's obvious. You're simply jealous of Chief. Sai Yuk, keep it down! Safety first! Don't think that you're Chen's godson and you can act outrageous. Wrong! l'm acting outrageously not because l'm Chen's godson... it's simply because... l'm me! What arrogance! Well then, let's see if you're worth your name. Stop! The Red Flower Society is no scoundrel's home. lf you wanna fight, fight the Manchu. We're in the same family. Excuse me, Chief. l just want to prove... his martial arts skill. l'll wait till some other time then. l want you to learn our regulations. l did not tell you to fight people. He started it first. Shut up! Kneel! Are you sorry for yourself? l have done nothing wrong. l was just trying to save that kid. Your motive was right, but the method was wrong. A great man will always consider the situation of matters... before he makes a move. Do you mean you'd let the kid die if you were l? lf it's really necessary... Yes! You don't have the potential to be a great man. You're not worth our organization. Go home to your mother. Sai Yuk, only the best persons are allowed to learn the regulations! This's the first condition to be inherited to the position of the Chief. Do you know Yu's intention? Yu wasn't allowed to learn them. That's why he was so jealous! Don't you know the real intention of Chief? You'd better go home. My dear, they all treat you badly here. Let's go home and see mother-in-law. You say so, too? You don't have to be rude. l'll stay here to prove myself. l'll slow them that there'll be the day... when l can achieve something on my own... and be their Chief. Want a fight again. Everything can be cooked. You may consult your mom. Madame, there's someone outside for you. What happened? Did l hold a party? l've heard Fong Sai Yuk is invincible, l've come for a challenge. Who are you? l'm from Black Wind Hill, Guangxi. People called me King of hell. - Unless! - Unless? Unless you're more powerful than me. l'm the winner of Canton's Beauty Pageant... the one and only-with a most desirable figure Miao Chihua... mother of Fong Sai Yuk. l'm busy. We're friends, give me face. - Miao Chihua? - Friends? Brother, test her kung-fu. l'll test her poetry skill. Poetry? l'm an expert. l learned if from my husband. Oh, my soup! l'm a piece of cloud. You're a piece of shit. Goodbye... Good morning class! Good morning sir. 024-43420-334024 Can you reply it? 173-173-173 60 cents for 6 seconds. Boss, she is fooling us! Beat her. - Beat her. - Wait! What's the most important thing to survive in this martial arts world. - What? - Read my lips. ''Deceit''! Attack. Go to hell. This is wonderful. You're unmatchable, Madame. Oh my soup! l have to save Sai Yuk from being bullied by these people. Madame, aren't you waiting for Master? Tell him that l'm going to the Red Flower Society. Madame, please tell young master that l've missed him. My dear son, l'm bringing you my soup. Waiter, check please. Right! 34 cents, please. Here you are! Thank you, sir! Mister, l have walked a long way and l am thirsty. Can you buy me a drink? Thanks... Thank you. l'll have to rush. On this first day of next month, a group of Japanese samurai will arrive... with a Sacred Box in which a most shocking secret it hidden. - Song Ziping! - Here! Guan Long! Here! Got you. lt should have been my turn. Li Guobang! Chief, l'm not worth the mission. l know no martial arts. You're too modest. l've a seafood dinner appointment with my fiancee a few days later. l just want to ask... if you have in mind someone to accompany me. Ask Fong Sai Yuk. Look at him he is so energetic. Thank you. l'll have to rush. Go ahead! - Fong Sai Yuk! - Coming! Go... Take this order. Yes. The purpose of the mission is to get hold of a Sacred Box. You mustn't fail. Even if you have to die for it. 49. Great number! 49? Why do you laugh, Sai Yuk? Because he did. l laughed louder. 49 means the greenest member in the organization. - What's your number, then? - Zero! My number is bigger that yours. Have you forgotten what l told you? Value your life. l just want to buy a scarf for my fiance. Don't worry! Thank you. My dear! This is a traditional custom for a first timer. lt'll bring you good luck. Thank you, dear. What are you doing? l'm going for business. Red is a lucky colour. Bullshit! l'm going now. Watch out, my dear! l'll wait for you. Fong is lucky to be sent on a mission. You're back so soon? Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! You're brought the horse, too? Okay, go and find the toilet yourself. lt's over there. What brings you here? Where's Sai Yuk? Where's he? - He's on a mission. - Mission? l've his favourite soup here. He must drink it to revive his energy. You've brought his favourite soup? lncredible! - Yes! - Let me see. You didn't even spill a single drop. Great martial arts skill! Watch out! Let's find a hiding spot. What's the hurry? What're you looking at? What're you looking at? l'm watching the birds. Our partner is over there. lt's dangerous for her to stand here. Lady, move! Oh, it's you! Do you know me? The Sacred Box. Take it. Watch out! Let's find a hiding spot. Attack! You beast. l've mistaken it. You beast! You screwed up the case. l'll help you unblock your nerve points. l learned it from my mom. Come on. My nerve points down under are still blocked. l've never tried those down under. Just try! My mom hasn't taught me. Let me carry you! Your head, please! Protect the box. He's brilliant! Save the girls. Don't stop, you beast. Shit! My nerves points have been blocked, too. - Save the girls. - Yes. Attack! Excuse me! Yamamoto Mushiro? l'm your mom! Mom, get the Sacred Box! The Sacred Box. Take it. Arrest him. Still alive? What are you talking about? Let me freeze you. You beast. You have played for half day. Let's go. Bastard. Mom, our nerve points are blocked. What will we do? Get someone to unblock them! Don't look at me. l don't know how! Really? My mom didn't teach me! Send your mom my best regards! You want to court my son? Son! A savior! See that, son? Do like your mom. Blow it this way and l'll be unblocked. Watch out! Let's find a hiding spot. Mom, the bee sure likes you. This way! What's that? Honey juice! Mom, what shall we do? You ate the savior! Bastard! Mom, l'll make it this time. Son of a gun! Son of a gun! Never mind about that bitch. - Let's go! What is it? - Nothing. Mom, why are you here? l'm taking my summer vacation. l've come to see you. Mom, how do you unblock the nerve points below your tummy. Press the navel. Son of a gun! l'll kill you! Fong Sai Yuk is back! Don't worry! l'll take all the blame of the Sacred Box. Mom, l don't mind being blamed. What a shame! He was worse than a dog. Right. l have a dog in my house. lt's called Fong, too. How shameless you are to speak in such arrogance! What are you talking about? You're siting here comfortably, eating water-melon... whereas my son almost lost his life fighting out there. He was almost killed by a bee. There's only one that counts in this martial arts world. Money. There are many ways of making money. You can be a street performer; a vender of betel nut... you can run a casino... or even make a movie! Shut up! The team for the mission was composed of nine persons. But only your son returned, unscathed. Fong Sai Yuk! Are you a coward who thinks only of yourself? Speak up! Answer me! Why did you escape? This is human instinct! Think! Damn! Mr. Yu, l admit that l've failed the mission. But never hit my mom. You're a fair man with an air of righteousness. You have no say here. Who are you? Yu! l'll handle this myself. Yes. Well, l'll tell you later. What's the relationship between me and Sai Yuk? You... are just relatives. What did you say? We don't have any post? So, what are we doing here? Haven't you heard the saying... that women mustn't live without wealth, and men, power? We have neither wealth nor power. Don't you think we joined the triads simply for fun? Tell me, who would have wanted that? Son, let's go home. - See you. - Mom. l'm not going. l've to get the Sacred Box. You can easily buy a similar box at the market. You're right! For the sake of Heaven and our country... we'll give the Red Flower one more opportunity. Why was there lightning when l touched her? Close the door and the window. Safety first. What have you doing? Let's spend the night drinking. l'd better leave first. lt's blocked. Well, it's done by me. See? This is what l've prepared for you. lt's strong but great wine. You'll love it. Please, ''sis'', l don't drink! How modest! l like this. Cheers! Please, ''sis'', don't get drunk. Don't get drunk! The wine overflows. You must drink with me. lf you don't drink... Please, ''sis''. Respect yourself. Respect me too. You're all mine now. We can't carry on like this. lt's hopeless. The wine only makes one sadder. lt's has turned into tears. We can't be like this! My God! Spare me from this! ''Brother''... l'm going. ''Sis'', l'm going. Take care. ''Brother''! Why do you have Master's ashes with you? l made this soup particularly for you. Drink it. People will laugh at me. Who knows? There's no one around. Courage is vital to survive in the martial arts world. Drink my soup. No. For safety's sake. l value my life. l'm leaving. You're too bad. Why don't you go with me? The more l drink this wine, the more l fall for it. You'll promise me anything if you're drunk. Cut the crap. Come on. Come over here, l have something to the you. l'd like to give you everything, except my love... to cure you of your psychological and physiological hurt. lndeed, l'm deeply hurt psychologically. Master taught you the skill of blocking nerve points... But he didn't teach me. Lower your voice, no one realizes that l know kung-fu... There's no point keeping the skill a secret. What l mean is, why don't you teach Sai Yuk the skill? You didn't break into my room to... To do what? You dumb head. Teach Sai Yuk the skill... and he won't be bullied in the Red Flower Society. l am drunk! We've reached. l mustn't let anyone know what took place last night. l won't bear any responsibility. You won't be responsible? What will l do? Tingting. Mother-in-law. Aren't you hot? You have put on a lot of clothes. - Hot... Very hot! - Why don't you undress? l am practicing kung-fu. l want to ask you one thing, my girl. lf... l say, if! Suppose there's a young married woman... who has made it with another man... l am talking about this, do you know? Like this, you know? l mean pregnant. Will you... show pity on her? You mean she picked up the man! She wasn't herself. She's an insult to all Chinese women. ln this world, some rob to donate to the poor... Some professional killer and kill in the name of righteousness. What does she want for an affair? Didn't she do this for the promotion of the economy? Such debauched woman. Should have been persecuted in public... paraded in the nude so that the people can spit... and throw stones at her and put her in a cage. Bath her with hot and cold water... then bathe her with acid. Her body should have been hanged at the top of the gate... her heart dug out. And chopped into 18 pieces... to make buns... to be eaten up by the dogs on the street. No doubt she deserves such punishment. This is the result of a bitch! Who is that poor woman? Mother-in-law! Where are you going? Where are you? Hey, control yourself! You'd control yourself! Now, there is big problem. For what you have done, you know it pretty well. What's wrong with it? What do you want? You bastard. How can l face the others? My youth, my love, and my luck. Don't pull my knife. You ruined my figure and future and everything. Your belly... None of my business. What? Don't you want to take the responsibility? l wanna kill you. Go to hell. lt's none of my business. Think over. Even we did that on that night. - l didn't do that. - Hands off. Only few days passed. How can your belly be so big! l... l don't know why. Everyone has different potential, l don't know how great are you. Hands off. Don't be impulsive, listen to me. Let me check your pulse. lsn't it a baby boy or girl? Stop dreaming, it's just dyspepsia. - What? lt's over. - Dyspepsia! You are a kind man, thank you so much. This is the evidence collected by the Japanese. Take good care of it. lt will be sent to the capital two days later. Yes! Angie... Dad. What are you thinking? Nothing. l can tell from your eyes. We failed to kill the Chief for so many times. He is being alert. Fong Sai Yuk is always with him. That's too difficult for us to assassinate him. Yes, we are being suspected too. l've checked out that the box was related to Chan Jialuo. A big secret is kept inside. No matter how, we'd take it. So Chan and his godson would be in deep shit. l worried that, if the box is taken by them... or taken by my brother. l can't restore the Ming Dynasty again. Fa Chi, the daughter of the Governor, likes Sai Yuk very much. lf he carries the mission, he will make it easily. No, it will drag Sai Yuk down. To sacrifice one but save the whole world, you'd not blame yourself. Most important of all, be straight forward in courting girls. Let's arrange a date for them. l have prepared the love letter for Sai Yuk. Godfather. l am leaving. What's the matter? The soup cooked by mom. Drink it. Help me to do one thing. No problem. You won't ask me to do something bad. Of course, you won't regret. Of course, what's it? Look. How bad is this word. Court, a slang, it means to know a girl. Why is it used? Court is a place which means law and justice. lt's decent, to make friends with a girl is decent too. No way, if Tingting knows it... She will kill me. No way. l asked you to court her. You work for me only. That's different. Which girl attracked you? You won't understand, l want one thing from her. Love, or anything? Bastard! lt's a box. l think, she likes you more, so l want to send you for this mission. Which girl you mean? The daughter of the Governor, Angie. l don't know her, do you want me to court her because l am younger. l think, let me do it. Hold it. l'll do it. Can't l do it too? Sure. You are not that good at courting girls. No way! He failed last time, you have no reason to ask him do it again. Let me take the box back. We are all black-listed. lt's not easy for you to enter the Governor's House, But Sai Yuk's had a clean record. l will make it. lf you get it, l will brush your shoes. Go and prepare the brush. lf you fail, what'll you do? l will get the box within three days. What will you do if you fail? l will ruin my kung-fu myself. You'd keep your promise. No regrets. On the verge of the river... How l long for this fair lady... The memory of her fills a sleepless night. By Fong Sai Yuk, Prince of Romance. Does this imply a courtship? Spring Flower, you're gorgeous. l did it! Dad! Dad, do you mind if l befriend a Red Flower Society member? Sai Yuk wants to see me again. He must have something vicious on this mind. No. Wanna make a bet with me? All right. What's the stake? Shouldn't we tell Tingting? l tell you, l am expert in courting girl. Are you going to court, or what? Do you remember the stance l taught you? Which one? Straight forward. Kiss then, she will obey you, and do whatever you want. lt's used successfully by your dad. - Really? - Go in! Watch me. Miss, show me your lips. Once again. Why is it you? Speak up. Mom. Once more. Granny. Speak. He wants to kiss you. What a hard job for my son. What's wrong with you? lnherited. Be quick, the nation is most important. Get up quickly. Great. Go! Don't you think l can't make it? lt's okay. God bless you. The girl... What's wrong? God bless you. What are you scaring? Be merciful, they haven't been kissed for a long time. Really? Kiss them too. No... Mom, what you have taught me didn't work. She dislikes man, l wonder. Really? - Do you really love me? - Yes. - Will you marry me? - No problem. On one condition. What? - l want the Sacred Box. - Okay. Dad will arrange a Boxing Competition to choose my husband. You should defeat all of them. And say you love me in public. - Deal. - Deal! Gentlemen, today's Boxing Competition... is set up to choose a husband for my daughter... who must prove his heroism by fighting for her love. The rules are very simple. Who catches the silk-striped ball at the top of the bridal sedan. will be my son-in-law. What a beauty! Why isn't he here? She'll be my wife alright. Bullshit! She's mine. She's mine! Why don't you shut up! l'm here not for a wife... but a concubine. Line up according to the alphabetical order of your names. l'll be first. Everybody, ready! Start! Let's go! Set up the bridge! Set up the bridge! Pull him down! Kick him down! Damn! Throw it down! Son, l've never carried such a huge flag before. Mom, l've never courted a girl with such a bunch of people either. What are you doing here? Get my girl. - To enroll for marriage. - No enter for being late. Really? Miss, have you been waiting for me? Disgusting! You go down and l'll give you a fortune. Why don't you pull out and l give you a fortune? Money doesn't mean everything! We're not talking about money. l'm talking about love. Go away, all of you! Fong Sai Yuk is here. Look! The man is flying! Super! Grab your young boss! Here l come! Strike first to get the upper hand! No way! So you're here at last! lf l don't come, who will marry you? - l do! - She doesn't like you! Do you really like me? Don't you know? You, stay in line! No matter what, you must marry me. Why are you always in my way? Get off! A promise is a promise. Stealthy! What is it that you promised me? l'll give you what l promised. Wow! Fantastic! Good! You're magnificent! l know what to do now. Thank you. Turn around. Why didn't you look at me? Stop! She's Tingting! Look at me! My dear, what's up? l wouldn't have known if l didn't follow you. Fong Sai Yuk, l detest you! Listen to me. l am doing this for... l'm not listening! l'm doing this for my country! - l'm not listening! - You want me to achieve something? You want to discontinue my family line? You look for it yourself. My dear! Watch out, my dear! lt's none of your business! You must believe me. l don't believe you anymore. Who is she? - She's her! - Let me tell you. l'm his wife. lt's just that we still haven't had our wedding. l don't mind that. But l do! Stop fighting! Dare you seduce my husband? l didn't. lt's mutual attraction. Save me some face, will you? No! No! Let's talk! lt's none of your business! Do you think l'm a jerk? She's so rude! You must prefer me to her, right? Tell her how effeminate and tender l am! What on earth is this! He's my lover! He's my husband! No more stupid disputes! Son, what happened? Mom, separate them for me. - One for each. - Okay, stop! Tingting, get up! Don't fight anymore. Listen to me. Sai Yuk is doing this for the country... Please be understanding. Even so, there's no need to sell one's body. l know. l guarantee that he won't sell his body next time. Okay, l'll be No. 1, you'll be No. 2. Why do l have to be junior? - Let me go! - Honey! Forgive her! She's still a girl! Give me some face. Don't be mad at her! - Listen to me. - What? l just pretended to love her! Good! So you don't like her at all! Slap her on my behalf. Good! Dare you? Go on! Thank you very much! My dear, don't! This is what l owed you! Sai Yuk doesn't like you at all. lt's useless to be after him. Are you afraid to look at me? No. All right! l'll kill myself! Watch out! My dear! Why do you save me? Let me go. You're my wife. Will l let you die? Let me die! l don't want you. l'll jump, too! Sai Yuk! Hold me tight! l'm falling! Very romantic! Let me go and die! Not so tight! You're killing me. Let me go! Son, l'm jumping, too! Grab me! lt's my turn. Mom, l've got only two hands! Don't be mischievous! Tingting, grab me! Mother-in-law, l can't! You down there, catch us! Why did l jump? You're useless! Can't even catch me! Damn it! Honorable Tingting, let's not talk about love. Sai Yuk is doing this for the country. Please accept my apology. Please be considerate. Honorable Tingting, please! Have mercy on Sai Yuk! Give me face. Give me face please? l beg you, give me face. Mr. Fong, congratulations to your marriage. Come on, give me face. Don't do this, Mrs. Fong. l don't deserve this. lf l don't do this, you won't come down. lt's alright now. Good! My good son! l love you. Can't hear. l love you... ''Sorry to see, but watch it quietly.'' ''There's sadness behind love and hatred.'' ''How to face sadness and boredom?'' Eh... ''Don't care about sacrifice,'' ''because of love and hatred.'' ''The value of life...'' Please stop singing, mother-in-law. He's making a sacrifice for his country. Being Sai Yuk's wife, l'd have offered myself for such physical molest in his place. You're still young. Such chance will come. Don't cry. Wipe your tears. Men are like a bowl of soup. When you start boiling it, it ain't tasteful... you've to boil it to a certain degree. To the point that it has absorbed all the essence... Then it'll be tasteful. lsn't that wonderful? What's wrong? What is it dries up? Change it. You know that l'm member of the Red Flower Society, right? Why do you exchange the Sacred Box with me? Because l love you. Good! l like honest people. Let's not waste time. Let's exchange now. Do you think love can be exchanged? No big deal! You buy, l sell. This is what you're after. So Godfather is the brother of the Manchu Emperor. lt'll mean trouble if Yu finds out about this. Mom! Sai Yuk, have you fixed her? Stop! Stay where you are! Every moment of a wedding night is worth thousand pieces of gold. Where are you hurrying? For a night snack. My son, you have wronged Angie. l don't care if you're a member of the Red Flower Society. Are you worth my son? lf he's your son-in-law, what am l to you? Don't we have the same interest? We're all in the family. You joined the Red Flower Society... because you want the country to be prosperous. You can achieve the same goal by joining me. Good! lf it's the same. Why don't you join the Red Flower Society? You'll be my junior. Do you want my daughter or the Sacred Box? The Box! l wanna hear that again. The Box! You've disappointed me very much. - Arrest him. - Yes! Hold it! l fear nothing. - Get him first. - Mom! Woo, a quick turn! What a cannon! See if you're more powerful than my cannon. Try this! Fire! What shall we do? Keep cool! Run once it explodes. lt's too fast! Watch out! Where's mom? Don't you make a single move! Stop! Dad, do you want me to die or him? Must you save him? Dad, l'm his woman now. You told me you didn't sleep with her. - l didn't! - You didn't? Sai Yuk was lying to her! Think of the country. Dad, let them go! Get lost! Forgive me, Dad. Run! Run as far as possible. Run! Thank you! Son, you're even better than your father. She's so generous! lt's the gang! Mom, Tingting! - After the man! - Yes! Mom, you must give this to Mr. Chan. l know, Sai Yuk. Take care of yourself. - Follow me, the woman! - Yes! Remember, Tingting! Make sure you'll give the Box to Mr. Chan. Okay! Watch out, mother-in-law. Run, Sai Yuk! Sai Yuk is back! Safety first. Godfather, l've fulfilled my promise. l've got the Sacred Box. You haven't disappointed me. Wait. What do you want? Do you want to destroy the evidence? What evidence? lt says inside that... you're a robber and a rape... a punk and a traitor... that you're the scum of the human beings... that you're an evil person. Now you want to destroy the evidence. lt surprises me to know that he's a better liar than me. What a slander! You're lying! You didn't get the Sacred Box! Fong Sai Yuk, where's your evidence? You can see that the Sacred Box is missing. All of us here... are undiscerning. Sai Yuk, watch out for your words if you haven't got the Box. Sometimes words alone can save one's life. Fong Sai Yuk, remember what you said? You said that... you'll destroy your martial arts skill if you didn't get it. Yes, destroy your martial arts skill! Now! Stop! You mean it? Godfather, are you really going to destroy my skill? Do you know our regulations? Once your father, he'll be the father of your life. Every country has her own law. Do it, then. Sai Yuk! l have destroyed his skill. l'll kill anyone... if he ever tries to hurt him. Sai Yuk! l'll never forgive Chan Jialuo... for having done this to my son. l swear that l'll revenge for Sai Yuk. Bastard Chen! ''Sis''... ''Sis'', calm down! Sai Yuk's tendons and veins weren't a bit injured. Every stick of Chief was restrained. - Really? - Of course. He's resumed consciousness. Sai Yuk! Mom! Give this to Chief! So it wasn't destroyed. Chief and Emperor Qianlong are brothers. - What? - Shit! lt'll mean trouble if Yu finds out about this. Safety first. l'll burn it. This can be used to threaten Qianlong. Guobang, this is vital for our goal of overthrowing the Manchu. Really? Goubang! - Lifang! - Shit! Yu and his people are here! Sai Yuk, quick! Safety first. The backdoor, quick! Come! Wait! Teach Sai Yuk well. The Book of Blocking Nerve Points! Aren't you coming? Say nothing! Go, quick. We will die if they get us. l'll fight them. Go! Fong Sai Yuk, show your face! Fong! Don't let him go! Fong Sai Yuk, get out. This is Li Guobang! Stop laughing! Sissy, stop acting like a hero. l'll show you what a hero is. Get him for me! l haven't fought for twenty years. Come. Try my Mighty Fingers for Nerve-point Blocking! Try... Lime! Guobang! Take care of Sai Yuk for me. Go, quick! You must take care of Guobang for me! Who are you? l am his fiance. You must rescue him. Where is Fong Sai Yuk? Speak up. ''Brother'', l'm coming! ''Brother!'' Fong Sai Yuk must be over there! Chase after him. Yes! ''Brother''... ''Sis''! l've realized now that you must practice your kung-fu often... Otherwise you'll lose it. ''Brother!'' l always tell myself, ''Safety first!'' But... l made the mistake of being too impulsive today. You weren't impulsive. You were just brave! l learned that from you. You once said... that courage is most important for this martial arts world. lt really feels great... to be a hero! ''Sis''! lf you meet me in your next life, remember... don't force me to drink any soup. Boss, Fong Sai Yuk has escaped. Take his mother. l bet he'll show up. l only wish that Sai Yuk won't blame me. l may be selfish... but l have to do it. Chan Jialuo! You think you can deceive our brothers of the Red Flower Society... about your relationship with Qianlong? Your days are over! Fong Sai Yuk is a useless person now. Miao Chihua is half dead. And Li Guobang is a corpse. l'll pluck up the bad seeds of the Red Flower Society today. l'm worth nothing. But l can't let the Red Flower Society be controlled by some traits. l'll die all right. How about them? Aren't you giving up their lives? Chief! Yotong, you... Chief, run... l am your Chief now! l order you to put down this sword! Although l am a Manchu by birth... l was raised by the people of Han. lf, for my sake... anyone of you has to endure any kind of suffering... how can l face the Ex-chief, the late Mr. Yu? Brothers, l have earned the Chief's throne... because l had your support. Congratulations, Chief! Chief, one person has refused to pay you respect. lt's her. Let her down. Everyone possesses the capacity of instincts. Let me see if you have them or not. Don't you dodge! Don't you dodge anymore. Wanna dodge? Don't worry, l won't kill you... not before your son shows up. Mom! Mighty Fingers! Mom! Sai Yuk! Any news of mom? l wonder if mom and godfather are well. Who are you? l'm your godfather's most trustful friend. He's imprisoned by Yu now. How's mom? They hanged her up at the Square. She was almost half-dead now? Mom! Sai Yuk, keep calm! We still have many loyal brothers. Your mother will be all right. You call them loyal? After Chief has been put into prison... many members have quit the community. The Red Flower Society has actually become a brigands' dan now. Your son is a gutless coward! He's given you up because he's too chicken to show his ass. Sai Yuk's never come! Fong Sai Yuk! My mother gave birth to me and raised me! l swear l'll save her. lf you're my brothers, let me pass. Otherwise, please don't blame me. My blades have no eyes. l don't want to kill no blood-brothers. He's blind-folded, kill him. Don't force me. l've told you to let me through. No more of this. We quit... Release my mother. You know why l didn't kill you, Fong? Because l want to humiliate you. l want to step on you. Like you're a pile of shit! l'm as tall as a hero. Let's see who's the one down under. Don't you know the price for a hero? lt's death. l don't have this word in my dictionary. Wanna save your mother? lt's not easy. Mom! Fong, l want both of you die. Mom! Your kung-fu is not bad. But not as good as mine. Mom! Freeze! Watch your move! Fong Sai Yuk! Aren't you a good son? Come on up! Come! Don't go near! l'm scared! l am scared. You know? l am scared! Fong Sai Yuk! lf l were you. l'll be very ashamed. Aren't you an obedient son? You can't even save your mother. Come up if you're any good. Don't you want to be a hero? Come and save your mother. Fong Sai Yuk! You're under my feet at last! You're a pile of shit now. You're dead now. Get up! Sai Yuk, on your feet! Act like a man. Get up, hunk! Go to hell! Mom! You scum! l'll kill you! - Mom! - Son. - Let's fight together. - Right! Go to hell! Fuck you! Mom, move aside! lnvisible Fist! Why are villains always so dumb? You bet! Go to hell! Mom, which is the fatal nerve point? The eyes, l think. lt's simple. lt's called the Dragon Bone Point. Here it goes! Son, you've hit the right point. The Ten Commandments! Thou shalt be loyal to Chief! Thou shalt not be cruel. Thou shalt not covet other people's property. Thou shalt not seduce your brother's wife. Thou shalt not be an informer! Go the hell with the Commandments! l'll revenge for Mr. Li! Done! Mother-in-law! Mom! Weird! lt's doesn't hurt a bit. No pain, nothing. You can at least say ''thank you''! Why are you here? lt's a plot clinches! My dear, why does everyone want to sit on this throne? lt ain't easy to be sitting on it. Let's not sit, then. Let's go home. l've told you that it ain't easy to be sitting on it. Help! The government troops are here. Stop! Chief! The troops are here! Stop! Young Master! Don't be afraid! We're on the same side. Godfather, let's say goodbye here. Mr. Chan, we'll see each other next summer when l've another vacation. Mr. Gang... excuse me, l mean Mr. Chan... Sai Yuk, you really don't want to stay with us? l've decided to quit this martial arts world. Quitting at such a young age? What a pity! Mr. Chen, if you'll organize some charitable function... we'll come to lend you our hands. Good! Can you fix those two girls? They're giving me headaches. - Easy! - Great! Sister, a present for you. No, l'm junior. You should take this present from me. No. You listen to me. This is a family treasure of the Fongs! lsn't it, indeed? So is this! Two pieces of family treasure? lt's important to know what present give to people in martial arts world. Presents always make ones happy. This is for you, Mr. Chan. You're very kind. Come... One for each. So this is the family treasure! Sai Yuk! Shit! Godfather, l have to go now! Sai Yuk, how dare you cheat us? l'll go first! See you! Take care! You too. Take care. Safety first! Don't go, Sai Yuk! Don't you take advantage of my son!
