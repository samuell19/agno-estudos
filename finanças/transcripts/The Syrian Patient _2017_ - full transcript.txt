In the dark, close to midnight in the Golan Heights, only a few meters away from the Syrian border, IDF vehicles wait to pick up wounded Syrians. The Syrian civil war, which started in 2011, steadily escalated and is still at the height of its horror. What began as a trickle of wounded fighters became a torrent of hundreds and thousands in the last 3 years, men, women and children. The IDF soldiers stabilize them and then evacuate them as quickly as possible to the nearest hospitals in northern Israel. I was hit by a rocket. Both my jaws were shattered. When I was wounded, the Israeli soldiers picked me up, they inserted a tube so I could breathe. I was unconscious. I was riding in a car and a jeep came towards me. I was bringing home some food, and they shot me from a distance. Had it been at close range, I wouldn't have survived, but it was from very far way. I was shot in the eye and my jaw bone was broken, from here to here, and I lost my eye as well. When he opened his eyes after he was transferred here, I was here beside him, and he couldn't believe it. I said to him: "Yes, you are in Israel. Don't be afraid." At first I was depressed because of my condition. I thought I would never be able to eat again. I am grateful to Dr. Eyal who took good care of me, who operated on me and gave me hope. This is a drawing of a nurse who took care of me. It's a drawing that expresses hope and life. I started drawing in Syria when I was little, it was my hobby. I see a rose and a dove. The dove is the dove of peace, and the heart represents dreams. When will the war end? It has no end, it will never end. He became attached to us and we to him, because he has been here so long and has suffered so much. Do you remember how he arrived? - He was in a bad way. Very bad. He came here directly from the ICU with... It's hard to describe how he cried and screamed with pain and because of... what he saw later, the way he looked. Half his tongue was missing, the jaw was gone, everything was gone. He did nothing but scream and weep. We gave him as many painkillers as we could, but his emotional state, he is alone here, no family, no nothing. To find himself in such a condition... Looking in the mirror, he saw the way he looked, it was terrible, terrible. It took a lot of effort and a lot of emotional support on our part, we were all there for him. In Syria, Assad's army regains control of one of the symbols of the uprising, the city of Homs, but at the same time sustains numerous losses today in a successful operation by the rebels in Aleppo. This is the large Syrian city of Homs, or more accurately, what is left of it. This city, which was the epicenter of the uprising against Assad, was pounded until nothing was left of it but rubble. And with this destruction, Damascus now officially marks an important victory in its war against the rebels. What surgery are you about to have? They are going to fix my nose. And the eyes? As for the eyes, the doctor said I will never see again. But one last operation, and maybe I will see again and go back home. I will go home to my wives and be a burden on them. How many wives do you have? I have two. How's your jaw? Good, thank God. What happened to your leg? I was shot. Where are you from? Homs. Do you have a fever? Does the leg hurt? What's the situation, Doctor? I spoke to the other doctor and we aren't sure we have to amputate. Thank God. - But he has a constant fever and we don't know why, and the leg is the likely cause. We will continue cleaning the wound the same way for three or four more days. He has a cleaning tomorrow. - Please help him, Doctor. He needs you to be strong and project optimism for him. No, he understands and he's a bright boy, a little man, thank God. What he's been through in the last 20 days would've broken grown men. His right foot has been amputated, and now we are not sure whether to amputee the other one. Have you told the mother? - Yes. Does the boy know? - I think so. The problem is that blood no longer reaches the foot. I can feel that his foot is cold. Yes, because blood doesn't reach it. Does it need to be amputated? - What? Does it need to be amputated? - Not necessarily, Rashid. We are doing all we can to make it better. He has taken from us what we held dearest. All we want is to be left in peace. He has butchered everyone. Doctor, bring a chair for my mother. I don't understand. My mother should sit down. - He wants me to sit down. Sit down and rest. I don't want to sit, It doesn't make me feel good. I prefer to be close to you. They are going to amputate. No, they don't want to amputate. Please, God, make him better. They bomb innocent civilians from the air. People uninvolved in the fighting. They have ruined the lives of our children. Nobody is helping us, we are being bombarded and Syria is a heap of rubble. My son has already lost one foot, and the other is in bad condition. He has nothing left. It's all because of the missiles, the oppression and the tyranny. Nobody cares, the world is watching from the sidelines. My son has been hysterical for five days, unable to conceive that he has lost a foot. He looked in the mirror two days ago and couldn't believe his eyes. He was a very active boy, wouldn't sit still for a moment. Now he is crippled for life. Nobody can compensate you even for the loss of a finger. What can he do with an artificial plastic foot? When would you like the CT? Okay, thanks. Bye. How are you? Good? Would you like to watch something on TV, or not? Some of the kids are operated on in Syria, and then they arrive here with all kinds of drains and sutures, and we don't know what was done to them over there. One boy was actually difficult to look at. He was five. He played with a grenade and it exploded. Those are the games they have over there. This boy came here, and in order to supply blood to his hands, to what was left of them, they had sowed his hands into his belly. It's not nice, it's dirty. Okay, here, he got ready. Okay, he is only allowed to change his clothes. I told you that. Come on. Where are you going? His true love, his true love. He' got a girlfriend now. There he is. Have a seat. Pull it down a bit. Open your mouth. This is better. Better. - This is better. Good. Here we are done, it's healing nicely, so we don't need to do any more. He should continue with the ointment up here. On this side it has closed. On this side we will cauterize it a few more times and suture it. That's it. Does he want to ask anything? Do you want to ask anything? - No. -No? He's my brother. - Your brother? -Yes. Like my brother. - What do you mean "like"? He has gotten under her skin. - Yes. He always asked me to bring him lentil soup, that my mother makes, and I bring it, he likes it. Bye, Majid. -Thank you. - You are very welcome. He has a big heart, Dr. Eyal. He likes to help people and make them happy. How did you guys meet? - I work here, I'm introducing a new computer system in the hospital. I used to sit here a lot, especially at night, and he came, stood beside me and started talking, yes. Then he asked for some colors. I brought him some, and we grew closer. You've been here a long time, right? How much longer will you stay here? A month and a half. Majid was hit by sniper fire. His injury was very severe, his life was in danger, and he underwent numerous operations just to allow him to live. It was one of the most complex reconstructions I'd ever seen, and we performed it together with several teams from other hospitals that came to assist us. When he woke up he was depressed. We were doing morning rounds, it was sometime during the morning, he opened the window and wanted to jump. And one of our doctors simply grabbed him and pulled him back inside. He simply wanted to kill himself. I need the "Love Story" theme song. It's a pity he can't understand me. Gila, would you like me to sing to you? Majid... Yes? Where's the Sabrina cake? - In the Fridge. Did you eat any of it? No, I don't have any appetite. - No? -No. Later? -Later. - Okay. I bought him a Sabrina cake. He really likes them. Since he discovered them, he's been saying they don't have them in Syria. She's Juliet and he's Romeo, the two of them... Majid, Majid. You are married. - Yes. Yes... What are you doing with her? She is my sister. - Oh, your sister, okay. I'll take her with me to Syria. I'm waiting for Dr. Eyal. Would you like to stay here? Listen, Dr. Eyal likes me better than you. No, he likes me better. Is Dr. Eyal coming? He goes abroad a lot, and brings me presents. Does he help you? - A lot. Every day. Every day. What does he do? - Beds... helps us do transfers, washes, changes sheets... Okay. In return, he gets a Sabrina every day. He even puts on gloves. I can't explain it, but he has won our hearts, He's like family here. I love him like a son, you understand? It's... There's a doctor-patient relationship. But beyond that, when you invest so much energy, time, thought, knowledge and emotion, there is a bond, no doubt about it. You can't sever that bond. He is already learning Hebrew. Let me remind you that he can't read and write in Arabic. But we talk, yes. He speaks to me in Arabic, and half in Hebrew, and I speak to him in Hebrew, and half in Arabic, yes. I guess you don't need language to communicate. Can you get me a pillow? Where, under your leg here? - Yes. Mom, call someone to give me something for the pain. What? - He wants a shot for the pain. Oh. Oh, it's not done yet. He wants a shot. A shot? No. - No. My leg hurts. A shot... A shot or something else. I'll go check, okay? She'll bring you something for the pain. You have been suffering for a month. Read this verse, read it. I don't want to. - Why? I can't. - What? I can't. He can't stand the pain. It keeps him up at night. He is on painkillers and shots all the time. May it be the end of all tyrants, God willing, and may they receive the punishment they deserve. She will be here in a minute. Amy! Move a bit. - I don't want to. Amy! Quick, quick. Water. Where's the water? The bottle is empty. - Where's the water? Where's the water? You don't feel well? I don't want a pill! Not the pill! Mother... I want a shot. It's not time for a shot. My leg is killing me! Killing me! Killing me! Rashid, what's the matter? You can't have a shot right now. You can't. You can't have a shot. A pill, just a pill. All right? - A pill. Just a pill. Okay? - Okay. Good. Easy does it. Patience, patience. Okay? - Okay. Great. What about some food? Falafel. Since they took off the second foot, the fever is gone. They did everything they could to avoid amputating, but then the blood stopped reaching his foot, so they had no choice. It was one day after you came here last. It was the only way to save his life. Do you feel like drawing, Rashid? Maybe a picture of Syria? He's like a princess now. No more pain now. No, everything is fine. Everything is fine. The defense authorities still don't release information on the Syrians, neither on the circumstances of their injury nor on the circumstances that motivated bringing them to Israel. Far from watching eyes, in a secret location, almost every day anonymous people bring more and more wounded Syrians into Israel for medical treatment, one moment after they cross the border from their bleeding country into what they perceive as an enemy country. Several days later they will again take this tortuous route, back to their villages and towns, where the fighting continues with no end in sight. Nobody knows what will become of them. How are you? - Good, thank God. Since the day I was wounded, I've heard nothing of my family. How were you wounded? I was in a car, and they hit us with a barrel bomb. It's a new rocket they've made, called "the Elephant." Where are you from? - Dera. -Me too. I'm going home in a month. - One month? Before you go, come see me, so I can send a message to my family. They possibly think I was killed. Nobody in my family knows anything about me. You miss your wife... - I want to see my parents, man. You are worried about your two wives. I'll tell them you are having an affair here. Who will you tell? - Your wife. -Go right ahead. I'll tell her you are in love and having an affair... Had you known how to read and write, you'd have done everything you could. But I can draw. - What? -I can draw. I can draw a map of Syria. - You're good only at drawing. -Sure. Call him. No, he went to his room to do his hair. - To comb his hair. Majid... Our sweet Majid is, how do you say it, "the gentleman of the ward." I'm crazy about him, crazy bout him. The first time he went back to Syria, we were sorry, he'd been here for four months. He wept, simply wept. And so did we. Here, mark what you want. - Baked meat, meatballs. Mark what you want, I'll order it for you. Do you want a banana? Banana? I'll put down banana. But you can't have baked turkey breast. Tell him he won't be able to chew it, it'll be hard for him. You can't have baked turkey breast. He can have meat loaf or turkey loaf. I eat, I can eat. All these are for me? Yes, for you. - Thank you. You made beautiful lines. But you don't need this dot. The name "Huda" is written without this dot. It ends with an alif, without a dot. A chair for the dining room, later. Come, love, come. There was another young Syrian here, he was released. When I developed this problem with my leg, they started helping me with the laundry. Hello. - How are you? How are things over in your country? I hear news about airstrikes, everywhere, not only in Dera, all over Syria. He has destroyed Homs, Aleppo, Dera, only the capital Damascus has been spared the airstrikes. He does not bomb areas where his army is, only everywhere else. My sons were arrested three times, it was a nightmare for me. They threw them in jail. They go into homes and arrest the young men, nobody was left in the neighborhood. Why? For what reason? For no reason. They didn't let the women move, I swear. They arrest the women too? - Yes, women and girls. They put them in jail? - Yes, the prisons are full. Children too? - Yes, women, girls and little children. When my son was in jail, there was an 11 year old boy there with him. They take people at random, trying to terrorize us. They are trying to terrify all of us. When we left Syria and came here, there was a massacre in our neighborhood, there were puddles... There were puddles... Puddles of water? - Of course not. Puddles of chemicals. Only a few days ago they bombed Homs and Aleppo. They fire chemical rockets. It causes paralysis, it's a chemical gas. We see it on TV. Here's a living example. Look what happened to him. I told them there were germs. They said, "what germs"? He did not feel it right away during the airstrike. I said: It's from the chemical rockets. How old are you? I'm 45. You are young. I have nine children. -Really? - Five girls and four boys. When did you get married? A long time ago, when I was in 11th grade. What grade is he in? Rashid was supposed to start sixth grade this year. He hasn't been to school for five years? No, he goes to school. - Are there any schools? Yes, makeshift ones. The Syrian people are scattered, most of them have left. At 8:00 or 8:15 in the morning airstrikes began, I think it was the Russians. They cluster-bombed Neighborhoods full of people. Emergency teams came from the city of Binnish. Does he tell you about his family, about the war there? His sister and his brother were wounded and died. - Really? They were killed? - Yes. They went to the market, he says, and a rocket hit them there, exploded right on top of them. Don't you find it strange, this relationship between you? He's like my brother, really. He tells me that I'm like his sister, too. We also bonded because he likes to draw, and I draw as well. I showed him my drawings. He made this bracelet for me, for my hand. When I was in the army, I'd sit in the guard post for hours. I was bored, so I'd make these bracelets from string. So he served in the army? Yes, I was in Assad's army. - Yes. So he made this for me, and I bought him this. See? -Very pretty. - Yes. He's also very funny. Once he asked me to put on a song, and then started dancing. You like to dance, Majid? I dance... when there are lots of people... He needs some friends to... Here everyone is broken and injured. The bench is wet. Let's see. - This is the first time I've seen rain in Israel. Is this your first time out in the rain? I like rain. When it rains hard I put out my hands like this, to catch some rain. My hands are shaking, it's cold. Cold is a beautiful thing. Are you cold? Look, I'm shivering. Let's go. You want to continue sitting out in the cold? Isn't it pretty? No, it's a bad painting. Oh... Look where the wing is attached, From below, not from above. Not from above... See, yellow would have been better. Yes, it would. The wing should be higher up, and slanted like this. Make it move, it won't go. The controls don't work, what can we do? It won't go very far. The batteries are weak. He can't believe it. Every day he thinks he is being released. Today they told him the operation is in a week. I have four girls at home, younger than him. They are alone, they have no father. He died three years ago. Yes, I want to go back. I want to see his siblings. Go where? - Home. -Home. How long have you been here? - Nine days. The house was hit by rocket shrapnel. And you father, what happened to him? He died. What do you want to do? - The girl is scheduled for a CT. She needs... They're going to reconstruct her jaw, and there are blood vessels involved so they need a CT, an assessment before the reconstruction. So you are also her caregiver? Her guardian, yes. -Yes? - Her mother isn't here, after all, so... How old is she? - Ten. Would you like a falafel? Shawarma? No. - No? I do want some! He wants some. - He sure does. He wants some labaneh. - With amba? Shawarma with labaneh isn't kosher. - Falafel? Falafel? You want falafel? We'll get you some falafel. He loves falafel and shawarma. Right now. - Right now? Okay. It's done. - Right, we're done. He takes the shot by himself. He knows the names of the entire staff, you know. - Really? Olga, Yehuda, Anna, Oxana, Marlene. A recovering boy wants to eat the food he knows from home. Even the food here tastes strange and unfamiliar to them. So our doctors even collect money and we collect money and they go and buy a shawarma, which for us is very trivial, but for them it's home cooking, so it's actually part of their recovery process. My husband is a paramedic, and for a while he was one of those who brought in the wounded. He'd bring me the Syrian children and say to me: here's one, and there are more and more on the way. We'd sit at home and talk, and I'd say to him: Do you realize what they have to deal with? Do you realize it? It's all right, everything is okay, don't be afraid. Be strong, you are a good boy. Sit up, sit up. Sleep, look at the world. This is your new home. Let's lean you back. Feel better, sweetheart. Don't be afraid, they brought you out of there. You are in a good place now. Dalia, What's up with the barber? He needs a haircut. His hair is long. It's grown very long. Very long. It's good food. Would you like some now? - No, later. Bon appétit. Do you like the majadra? - Yes. Good. Food chokes her, so for now she takes no food at all, and is fed like this, intravenously. For the time being that's her nutrition. So small, tiny. She's how old? Two and eight months, we said? I am afraid to go back to Syria. Who knows what's happening there? That's life. Good morning. - Good morning. How are you, Suzie? How are you? -Fine. - How are you? Good morning. - You're here? Majid is Majid. Majid, have you eaten? - No. No? Why not? Are you fasting today? It's because you are with him, that' why he won't eat. I'm eating in Syria today. Oh, you are going back today... What a pity. It was nice having you here. You're done? When are you coming back? - In two months. Your hair is standing on end. Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Hi, how are you doing? Actually, I'm not sure. Are you having an operation? - What? -Having an operation? You're going back to Syria? They want to give you an operation? I don't know, maybe I'll have an operation. Where? - Here. And here and here. Suzie! - Yes? Would you like to come with me? - What is he saying? Would you like to come with me? - Will you go back to Syria with him? Well go together. - Sweet Majid. There's no-one like him. And if you don't come back? - No, it's okay. What if you die? - What? Never mind... What? I've had it with those airstrikes. Listen, when you hear a plane, you go like this and lie down. What will he do without you? What will we do? What? Tell him his ride is here. Wait, I'll get Fanny. Wait, wait. So he's waiting. Are you ready to leave? Dr. Eyal is in his office. You can go in there if you want to say goodbye. I want to say goodbye. - So go into his office. Is Majid here? - Yes. What, you're going home? Right now? Really? Don't, don't cry. Okay? If I go back, will you come? Take care of yourself, okay? Take care of yourself, okay? For the road. As though we haven't been eating it all year. It's from all of us at the ENT ward. Oh... he's crying. Now I'll start crying too. Come on. - Come on. They don't want to say goodbye. He doesn't want to say goodbye. Come on, let's go. Bye, Gila, Fanny... Security. She's so cute... It's hard. Is that Majid? That's from before he was wounded. - Oh, before. Wow, I didn't recognize him at all. Where did you get it? He sent it to his friend... He's holding pomegranates. Would you have recognized him? - Of course. I always knew he looked like this. Zoom in on his face. Do you miss him? - Yes, of course. And he? - Yes, he misses me too. Will he be back? He said he'd be back at the end of the month. Hello? - Majid? What? -It's Huda. - Huda. How are you doing? Great, and you? When are you coming back? It's already the end of the month. In two days? Where are you? On the bank of a brook? You have brooks over there? We don't. What? Your sheep ran away? Your sheep ran away? How many? 50 sheep? Bring me one! All right, bye. Be well. - Thank you. Why aren't you stepping on your left foot? - What? Why aren't you stepping on your left foot? - I am. You are, but not all the way. Are these the Syrians? Yes? There's nobody inside? - No. Walk and show me how you put weight on your left foot. He is lifting his left heel. Go on, go on. Are you feeling any pain? - No. He's fighting. - He's fighting? Are you being released today? I meant to release you tomorrow. I think tomorrow is better. - We coordinate with Syria and the army. He coordinates with the army. The army can come today or tomorrow. I asked for tomorrow. I want to be released today. - Don't argue with him. Walk. Step on your heels now. Step on them, go on. Go on. -I'm walking normally. What? - I'm walking normally. Go on. Where are you going? I'm going to run. - You want to run? Go ahead. Go on, run. Fast. What's your name? - Rashid. My name or his? Rashid. He's Rashid, and you? He's Rashid and I'm Sheikha. - Sheikha? -Yes. Where is Rashid? I said Rashid. It's... Rashid. - Rashid. Rashid. Al-Madhayir? - Yes. And what's her name? What's your name again? - Sheikha. -Sheikha? -Yes. We've been here four months. It's not easy. He's... shovav (naughty). Shovav? He's shovav, a troublemaker. Naughty, naughty. - Naughty Rashid. We cried today. Life goes on. No, don't cry. Even if we lose our arms and legs... Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. When peace comes... - You'll come to my coffee shop. -I wish. Thank you, Smadar. Only ENT assist here. Nobody else touches her. Hello, hello, how are you? How are you doing? When is Dr. Eyal coming? - He's in surgery. When will he come? - He'll be in surgery for about two hours. How is Majid? He's lost a lot of weight. Did he say anything? - Barely... They did some tests. Have you fallen out? Is there a problem, or... - Complications. Complications... Inside complications, real complications. He may look different... His hair... Is he here? Wait here a few minutes. I'm afraid. How are you? What's up? How are you? I'm shaking. -What's wrong? - I'm shaking. What happened to you? I got an infection, I had headaches, I was hospitalized there. I was hospitalized for several days. They fed me intravenously. I stopped eating and drinking. You are awfully thin. My face got all swollen... And I can't eat. You stopped calling me. I was in treatment for a month. Your wife? - She's jealous. She didn't like it when we spoke. More importantly, what is it like over there? - What? What's the situation like over there? Over there? Depressing. - What? Depressing? -What? - Depressing. -Depressing? I couldn't wait to get back here. Hi! What? How are you? - Fine. Yes? - Okay... What, he doesn't eat? Huh? No food? No? - He keeps throwing up. Because of the face, I have headaches. Show me your teeth. Open, open. Looks good. It hurts here. -It does? - Inside. -Inside. Tomorrow we'll x-ray his mouth and jaw, and see what to do. Then we'll decide how to proceed. I want to see... Perhaps inside there is exposed bone, and that's why it hurts. Okay? - Good. Sit down. Okay? - Yes. Okay? You want to go in and say hi? What's up? How are you? - Fine. Yes? - Fine... How are things over there? What's the situation like? - What? Horrible. How's his wife? How's your wife? - Okay. Pregnant? Is she pregnant? - Yes. Yes? Yes? - Yes. What? - I'm feeling dizzy. You're dizzy? - Yes. -Why? My head... No, I want to stand. - Sit, sit. No, I want to stand. - Sit... Sit. Want some water? You need to put on some weight. Where's your wedding ring? I took it off. Imagine someone marrying four wives. We have a guy who married seven. They all live together, and eat from the same plate. I was so happy to see you. Majid, why don't you take care of yourself? Your wife hates me, doesn't she? - What? What does she have to do with anything? She hates me. You called me, and we only spoke for an hour, we only spoke for an hour. No, Majid. Majid, she's your wife, I'm nothing to you. - No, no, no... She can't decide for me, about my relationships with people. Majid, I'm nobody. As far as I'm concerned, if life goes on this way, I don't want to stay with her. Majid, Majid... It's wrong to behave this way, okay? She's your wife and she is everything to you. You will stay together you die. You understand? Why does she interfere in my life? I can take a second wife straight away. No, Majid. - What? -No. Is that how I taught you to behave? I'll take a second wife... Majid, I'm not sure I'll ever see you again. I've had a lot of trouble because of you. I'll miss you. I don't want to be loved anymore. I'll miss you. I wish she knew some Arabic, the woman soldier who will be with us in the car. Here's 29 shekel. Slow down, Rashid. You want a plate of shawarma? Want some cabbage? - No. -Onion? -No. That's all? And some pickles. Thank you. No need to pay. No need to pay. You let us have it for free every time. What's up? Will you miss this park? Rashid, bye-bye. Stay well.
