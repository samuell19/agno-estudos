Many readers wrote to ask me how I found so many things to write about In fact, some happened to myself Tonight's theme is about three persons No, two men... and one cat, to be exact And the story should begin with my friend Li Tung You make so much noise at this hour every night Don't people have to sleep? Now I couldn't care less! Open up! Open up! Why don't you open up? Open up, open up! What the hell's the matter with you? You make so much noise after midnight every night What are you hammering? A coffin? Sorry to have disturbed you You're making me nervous If you go on, I'll call the police My goodness! I'll try... to cut down the noise Easy Up! Be careful. Take it easy Easy Be careful! Sorry, I'm really sorry Are you moving? Sorry for the noise I caused You hammer each night... for what? Wait a minute Can start now Li Tung told me that out of curiosity He decided to go to that old man's home to have a look Mr Chen, they can still move These intestines are fresh-scarcely 2 hours old Wang Chieh-mei, the intestines of a child? Don't panic before the truth is out They're intestines all right But it is a cat's, not a man's I told you not to make any fuss! Right No more gory violence. Cheers! Brother, I don't drink before sunset The sun has set in many parts... of the world Come on, drink Really want me to drink? Drink What is that? Vodka, the strongest wine in the world It can burn easily, terrific! Terrific! Pai So, are the crabs ready? You've been teasing me the whole night Don't keep bullying Li Tung We bully you? Eat crabs This wine is very strong Good Give me a gun Gun? Show me Come on, really nice These wines won't agree with you Try yellow wine for better taste Hong Kong people can drink at will. So lucky Thank you, madam Come on Come on, drink A bigger gulp Wisely, there's something spooky about that house That can and girl stared at me with eyes wide open Wang, can the police get someone to investigate The whereabouts and background of that cat? If we had time for that We might as well catch a thief Who's got time to care about that cat? Crazy! But frankly, that cat and girl do Look like demons in Greek mythology Nothing could arouse your interest more than firls Don't get jealous over nothing! I have a strong feeling Friends even suspect me... to be from another star I am convinced that girl and cat come from another star They should be good-natured But kindness is bound to bring evil Evil is coming to pass in this city Something... strange happens in the historical museum There is a gadget in the museum An octagon, which baffles even the archaeologists But to the starmen It's an important weapon Who's it? Who's it? Errol Curiosity is the finest thing in life Curiosity leads to progress And retards the ageing process Young girl, cat, old man, they all disappear But I must follow the case But how to get started? Well, Li Tung said That when that girl moved The transportation company seemed to be Jen Jen I remember seeing the TV... and of and old man lifting his finger My curiosity forces me to get to the bottom of the thing What? Someone's coming? With the address given me by that old man I eventually found the house they live in There's nobody, don't panic! We must find the other octagon as soon as possible Only then can we wipe out the star killer And return home If by chance we can't go back We'd better die over here Who? Who's there? Come out quickly! Don't hurt him! Destroy him just in case No, we can't kill mankind There's no hatred between us I thought I was dreaming Till I see... this wound I never knew a cat could fight too And so hard That cat tried to kill me, but that girl saved me This matter is getting increasingly confusing That cat is dangerous But when I woke up in that house that day I found no trace of either the cat or man I gave up hope... of getting to the bottom of the case Till Pai So... and I discovered that cat's trace On TV News the other morning Got it from a ball game? I hit myself against the wall Why? I could've helped you You? You didn't even come once a week What's the matter? Why take my underwear When you've got so much of your own? It gives me the feeling... of you holding me close? You don't need me any more then You went to bed late last night. Why get up so early today? Want to sleep 4 hours a day like Napoleon did? He'd sleep 3 hours a day only If he knew 1997 was fast approaching Is a man more potent early... in the morning? Here now is a special announcement A mysterious theft occurred In a historical museum early this morning The burglars stole only an octagon... with centuries of history No other items on display were lost The burglars broke in through the window, according to the police They broke the glass box... and took away that We also believe... they fought 2 guards And ended up killing them Here ends this special bulletin I'm sure it's linked with that big cat I'm going too Let me take a bath first Okay Don't! You scoundrel, you fling me down the water! Damn it! Don't go! Wang Chieh-mei? I'm now going to the spot of the theft See you at the Exhibition in half an hour. Goodbye Morning, sir Sergeant, how's the situation? No idea. Go and see for yourself There are traces of burn all over But no signs of a fire I guess no human could've achieved this Everything else okay? Sir, the man who takes fingerprints is here Here? What? Taking fingerprints when it's all burnt A matter of procedure only Morning, Mr Chou Morning Sir, I won't handle the hair I'm sure it was that cat's That cat's wrought so much havoc But I can do nothing about it Animals punish sinning animals One can't live... with incessant barks And still enjoys it. What a crank he is! Chen lives alone in such a big house Because no one cares... to work for him So it's you, Wisely Never imagined that? I only want to see these dogs This is my friend Inspector Wang This is Mr Chen Please come in Chen, tell your baby not to be so passionate Remember you were scared by my dogs last time? Chen, I want to borrow a dog from you The fiercest and most belligerent one What for? To get even... with a neighbor's dog? No, a cat Cat? You must be joking Heard the morning news? I suspect it was linked with that cat Under these circumstances, we must assign Lao Pu Which Lao Pu? Look, he's taking a rest This is Lao Pu He's the most beautiful yet bravest dog in the world No dogs are his match I think he's eligible But how can I take him out if he's not in the mood? There are not more than 10 dogs of this pedigree in this world He has a unique personality... and hates beck and call He keeps calm when facing a strong rival He's a real fighter and looks every inch like one He's a dog with a difference Say something nice to him Lao Pu, you really are a good dog I've never seen anyone as capable as you are Now, take him away I'm leaving Bye-bye Thank you Mr Wang Got a lead... on the bank robbers Let me go and see I've had joy rides with girls But never with a dog! Now that dog has been following me like a close friend I feel the same way too Could I have changed? Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! I've lost my best friend Wang Chieh-mei It takes 3 days... to mutate the human body So we must make use of the human body... before the mutation is complete sure Now go and get the weapons Get going Mr Wang, can I help you? What's so urgent over the phone? Some of your folks got killed? It won't happen at my home What do you mean, Mr Wang? I'm joking too What is it all about? Guns Can't you get them from the arsenal yourself? We must keep this a secret So the police are perpetrating They take the law into their own hands even before 1997 I would've arrested all of you If your brother hadn't been my man Show me This is Milan 357 calibre, the deadliest Colt Fatal Inspector uses it too It has too few bullets Fast loading makes it as effective AKM is the most advanced portable light machine gun of the Communists All the Terrorists use it It has too few bullets and is heavy USMG, an Israeli official; weapon fires 1,200 shots per minute MP5K, H&K, West German It fires 850 shots per minute I also need guns with loose bullets The ordinary Remington has 5 shots only Your looks show it's not enough This is Demonstrator The 1 st Roulette Loose Bullets gun with a round of 12 shots Thank you What for? Business is business. Police or thugs pay alike Collect it from hell! Mr Wang, that's not a funny joke I'm not joking I mean to finish off your mom too You're not human, you're not human I'm not human I'm not human Bye-bye Wisely, hungry? Shall we order snacks? Follow me Quiet! After him! You've made a mess of my Lao Pu Luckily Lao Pu is still alive Or Chen, a pet lover, would've forfeited my life for him Professor Yu, how's Lao Pu? How's Lao Pu? He's going to live. Don't worry I'm now at ease He's so strong, he's going to survive any men He'll be OK in a week or two Thank you. Professor Yu Thanks for saving his life Lao Pu Good boy, let's go home Lao Pu, let's go home Be nice, Lao Pu Lao Pu, let's go home. Be nice Professor Professor Yu, how's the lab report on that cat's tail? Wisely, what are you up to? This is a university lab Why make fun of me with a dead cat's tail? Dead cat's tail? Yes, bone analysis shows it died... scores of years ago After the carving, we can wipe out the enemy? If we piece together the two octagon That'll sure kill the enemy Don't worry, I'll take you back General Errol, he's injured How come that cat's tail is missing? Why did you get to Wisely? Our duty as knights is to protect our master Now you've lost part of your body How can we take you to leave the earth? Errol, don't blame him He is also a brave knight He got that compass himself What happened last night is incredible! The tail of that cat... I chased stuck by my car's trunk And he ran away after biting his tail off After analysis, it belonged to a cat who died over scores of years ago But I saw it... fully alive How could it be a dead cat? Want to have a look? So ugly, it's better to bury it quickly You're evil You're damned, you scare me Could that cat be coming back... to find his own tail? Impossible! Don't make me nervous Pai So, don't move, let me cope with him Wisely, don't! Please don't worry. We mean well Who are you? We... we're not earthmen We come from outer space We fled to the earth... only because Our star was occupied by evil influence When the old man was telling the story Space killers were closing on us I owe you no grudge. Why did you try to kill me at Tang House? We didn't mean to That night you slipped into Tang House We didn't mean to knock you unconscious It was we who saved you What about the cat intestines... Li Tung found at your home? To prolong that cat's life I kept researching the cat bowels Wisely, now we're all in danger Our bodies must get out of earth quickly We must graft this cat's tail first How can you do it?

You take a look too Come over and see How are you going to go back now? Is this your spaceship? What? Spaceship, it's an earthman's term. Primitive Your star emits very strange lights! I've got in contact with them The octagon has picked up signals from space Stellar radioactivity... will melt us into the galaxy To decompose our bodies And we'd be homing on the radio pulses That's tremendous! The general's body has been radiated He's now the strongest knight... in the universe Does it mean that if our bodies were decomposed We could likewise go to your star? Splendid. Let's go up on a pleasure tour You're already going back. Leave quickly If the enemy should keep up, it'd be too Fare you well We can't leave till the enemy is wiped out We now have the conquering weapon That tool? The cat's body The cat's body as the weapon? The octagon, when meshed with cat's hair, can decimate cells Why didn't that cat kill the enemy... when you were at my home? The octagon... didn't receive the stellar signal Now the time is ripe You know where the enemy is? We have hunches of his existence We can leave now Wait Let's go with you Pai So, report to the police now Leave through the back!
