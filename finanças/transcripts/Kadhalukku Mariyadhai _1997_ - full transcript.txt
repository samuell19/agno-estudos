Sending us away you took the dead body in the Jeep Did you bury or cremate him? How?... How? Not to the lower court or High Court We'll go even to the Supreme Court If necessary, his cremation ash may come as witness You're not as simple as I had thought You're very intelligent yes... yes...

If this is your wish, I've no objection _okay So, we both are friends shall we go somewhere? We'll go... We should enjoy life nicely We'll go anywhere No problem But, before going if you produce Raghavan before AC I'll be relieved You don't worry, Raghavan is not dead - that I know it I have hidden him at a place without anybody's knowledge Where?... Where? Tell me..... where is he? That is.... Not only you.... Even if your father and Great Grandfather comes and asks also... I won't tell How dare he talks about our father and Grand father?

This kind of person shouldn't stay alive, Go... Go... For that, why are you tensed up? All these problems are because of me.... What do you mean? Yes, that day, did they come and sit with us in Restaurant? We only went, isn't it? Still, how decently they behaved? He said that he's going to marry you, Is this decency? That's what I didn't understand... What's there to understand in this? We've given him a little space Now he's sitting on our head.... Who is he? "JEEVANANDHAM" They call him Jeeva Now, he's doing MBA Do you like him? Huh? Do you like him? Yuck! what do you mean? I'm very scared that my brother May be suspended Hey! look there.... huh Let's go - Why? He has come to see me only I'm scared... let's go Why should we get scared? Let him come, I'll talk to him Will you come or not? No... I'll go...

I said you're the one whom I'm going to marry' What I've said is true Still, I shouldn't have said like that I realized it later For that, I apologize to you wholeheartedly Forgive me.... Wait.... It's not only your mistake it's also mine That was wrong When I sit near by you at Restaurant There's no other reason it's all because of me.... Give any punishment to me.. If any problem arises for my brother I can't bear it Please, bring out your friend from the hidden place Please, forget everything By saying everything...

Don't believe women They'll deceive us... 1 day or atleast for 1 hour that inspector should be suspended Do you know how much he had beaten us? I didn't count the strokes Shut up Till that inspector gets suspended I won't come out from this place To get my lover Mini, you said you'll sacrifice anything for me Now, if you obey me, I'll get her... Are you sure? Sure... Wait... wait... I'll give to everyone... Shantha, keep it... Ask your mother... Mother... What a great miracle?... You've bought many things... what's the matter? Why are you asking? The problem which would've put me in a soup let me off lightly I would've got suspended but now it seems I'll get promotion The one who died, came alive and stood infront of AC Not only that... He gave the statement that even my little finger didn't touch him Only now, they understood your power For 2 days I was very much tensed up I never slept Only you were tensed up for a small problem We all slept peacefully You should've courage when you're in police force For silly thing, you were tensed up for 2 days...

Wait a minute, I can hear the sound of anklets I saw lightning in her eyes She has en-heartened thousand wishes within me I don't know why she has closed the door of her heart? She has afflicted me throughtout the day and night She changed my heart and stamped on it, her name She has kindled the fire of Love Today, will I get a favourable answer from her? Will she pave a proper way for my peaceful sleep? Will my desire and Thirst be fulfilled? Will the Rhythm and tune be fused?
