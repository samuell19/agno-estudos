Okay, well thanks. Jeff, the SAT NAV is broken. What's the matter with it? It just says we are completely off the map. Could it be isn't it updated or something? How do you date it? Plug it into a laptop. Here, this is a trooper map, Coordinance Survey. And they never lie. There you are, you see? Mortlake. Right up the end of this road. Carry on. - Are we there yet, Jeff? - No. I don't know why you bother her? She ain't going to talk. She like a mute or something. - Woah? What respect? - No, no, it means she gonna talk. Woah! Didn't know you could talk, Tim. Yeah! Cut it out man. Giving me a headache back there. We don't want your life story, man. Alright! - Ow! You fucking bitch! - Well, what's going on, huh? Calm down, please. Hey, Tim .. - Got any sexy pics on your phone? - No, why? Not? Well, you're a bump behind there? - Is he always such a prick? - Yeah. Oi Jeff, can we smoke?

Okay, further up. Keep going. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Why is it not on here? "The Dirty Hole"? That's charming. Well, Mortlake is one of the north's oldest coal towns. I suspect the name probably refers to mining. You'll like that, yeah old Jeff? The cottage should be straight up here. Well, it's been certainly rustic, isn't it? - Rustic? - This gonna be shit. - Did you see that? - Yeah. We have another ... another 200 yards. First one to see it gets a prize. Everybody out. Come out and get some fresh air. Wonderful, huh? No, I'm away till Monday. I called you not to tweet me. Yeah. No, I can't decide. Yeah, alright, so. Just that ... - Dwight, phone please? - What? We haven't come all the way out here to look at another way of life so you can miss it just cos you're chatting to late on the phone or or viewing dirty pics, have we? Hmm. Phone please. No, I'm getting licked from some idiot. Yeah, alright. Later. Good lad. Okay. Same applies to everybody. Just put your phones in the bag, so we can appreciate our environment. - A fucking joke. - Okay. Thank you. Great! - What are you thinking? - What am I thinking? Well, I think that I've stayed in better squats than this, Jeff, really. Don't judge a book by it's cover, hmm. Wow! - What's this? - A poor house. Shit cover. Shit book. We need to locate the fuse box, that's all. Hmm. That's odd. Are you worried? Are you sure? Come on. Whoa! Get English thing, all right! - What are you doing, Dwight? Stop it! - Oh, come on.

If you want you can open the car all the way in and ... - Stop it. - Oh, what's it all about? - She was joking. - Dennis tried to poke ya? - Alright, go on. - Chaotic, it is. Oh, come on guys. Cheer up. We just got the old boiler going. I know it's a little bit ramshackled and a little bit dusty. We are not here on holiday, are we? This is the point. Work together as a team. Pull together, as one. And we can start by clearing this place up together. How about that? Yeah, I'm not sleeping in this Jeff mate, it's a fucking shithole. Yeah, seriously. Am I missing the tip? Yeah, okay. I know it is a bit of a shithole, guys, but we are in now. So we better get working together as a team. And a good team that works together hard, plays hard. Get all cleaned up and go down to the pub. Yeah, can we wait outside. Please, Kate, come. Jeff, what is your problem? I was just having a laugh. Do you think it is wise taking these kids to a pub? I mean, some of them have had alcohol issues. Now, Dwight would be a problem. I wasn't going to get them pissed in giving message. I was just trying to motivate them and have a bit of a laugh. Have a bit of fun. Jeff, we are care-workers, we're not their parents. Why do you always insist on alienating yourself? - Alienate? - Yes, alienate. You think I'm alienating people just because I'm trying to impose a few rules, huh? See, there you go again. Rules. Rules are meant to be broken. These kids are heavy because they bite rules, Jeff. Why don't just chill out, have some fun and call me about a slut like I did. - Finished? - Yeah. I'm finished actually. Thank you. Good. Look at this stuff. Like it's been here for years. What is it? We need this thing along. Yeah, no I'm not walking down to the door. Hey fuck that. Gosh! Think there's something valuable in this one as well. Valuable, you say? - Yeah, I think so. - Alright. Thank you chief. Yeah, well done, guys. This is a very, very real achievement. I think what this proves is that we, we as a group from different backgrounds with different... - Come to a point! - Thank you, Dwight. From different backgrounds with different problems, when we work together as a group, see we can really affect change. Not really reflects well on each and everyone of you. You may not know, but what you learn to do is turn your negatives into positives. Let's go stay with you for the rest of your lives. As you get older and storm ... Alienating. Alright. Come on everyone. Cheer up. Let's walk to the pub, can I see his name.

Don't worry, he's got his gun, though. Going after who? Outsiders. When they got away and went off beyond. For fuck sake, why didn't you tell me? He didn't want to stop the show.

We're not going back. There's nothing else we can do, Sam. We've got to go back. Kate, I'm sorry. But I just meant to. Well, maybe that's what they'll think. We need the maps and we need the phones. We need to tell someone where we are. Can you just get us out of here, please? Sam, that's what I'm trying to do. Come on! Alright, listen to me. We need to be quick. We need to look for the phones and the map. They are in here somewhere. I don't know where Jeff put them. I need to look everywhere, okay. I'm going to check all the stairs. Look, Sam here, you can ... I'm gonna check the kitchen, okay? Where are all the phones, Jeff? Got the maps, did you find the phones? They're not in any, Kate. We looked everywhere. What's in that room? That room's have been fucking locked since we got here, Tim! They are here. I know they're in because Jeff put them in a bag and hid them somewhere. Now we're not looking properly. - Did you try the dining room? - Just long in that. Well, let's look again, shall we! Fuck it! - I can't find anything! - Kate! We're scared! We can't be able to get caught like the others, do we? I'm scared, Tim! I'm scared, scared, scared! We need to phone the police, we need to tell somebody that we're here. They're coming for us. They've got guns. Otherwise, we're dead. Do you understand? Why don't we just go now? Kate, please. We've got the maps. Listen. I'm going to check outside in the barn. You need to look at the map and see where we are. I'll be back in a second and join the family. Good evening. I reckon my first blood lads. Yeah. And it will be fi fy if I go. Well, next we've got the north, they said they want to go... Fi fy if I go. They pulled down father's checks, and chopped off all his legs... Fi fy if I go. They took his dirty wife, and buried her alive... Fi fy if I go. They took all dirty kids, and fed them to the pigs ... Fi fy if I go. Shit!

Double or nought. - 1 leg? - Right. - You, are you alright, are you? - Oh yeah Podge, it's that last break. - What if she loses? - Leg. Only one mine. Let's get it over. Come on. It's alright. You're okay. No! Stop! Fuck! Glad you're on, Podge. - You might know what I told ya. - Yeah, she's proper feisty that one. There she goes. Come on, lass. - What are they doing? - I don't know.

Look. We don't want any more trouble okay? Nor I. Prove it. Well. Greg, come over here. You all right? I'm pretty good. Well? It's safe, Jim. - You found it. - Away, lads. It'll be alright. They are down here. Greg, on with you. What the bloody hell has been going on down here? Stay there. No closer. Don't you dare fucking move! Careful, son. A lot of broken glass. You'll cut yourself. Put your weapons down. Been having a bit of a shindig down here, don't ya? Not me. The party just beginning. Now put your weapons down. Podge, put it down. Put it down. I know what you all are thinking. Would I kill myself? I don't know. Would you? You know how they gamble? Well, we lost a little bit shape lately. Yeah? But its about to get more fucking worse. Time to turn on the heat. - Oh fuck! - You're cold lad? I don't understand me. Alcohol should burn. No. No, no. That's watered down piss, lad. Wouldn't give it to me missus, God rest her soul. We make a good brew bucket in the mill up there. Ain't it a treat. Fuck! Come on! Get on, Podge. Come on son, let's get this sorted out. Fuck you! Fuck you, cunt! Fucker! No! No! No! Please! - What are the odds? - The trap's favourite. Evens. Pit 3 to 1. Tripwire, 7 to 1. My mine's outsider. 15 to 1. - 10 on land mine. - You throwing it away again, Jim. No! No! Fucking bugger. About the time me luck changed. - Oh well. A pint? - Alright! Let me tell thee all, the fate that did befall... Fi fy fi fy go. When outsiders came and tried to stake a claim ... Fi fy fi fy go.
