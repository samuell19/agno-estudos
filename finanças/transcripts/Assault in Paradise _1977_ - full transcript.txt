(moaning) (screams) (gun fires) (horn blaring) (screams) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (groovy music) (slow native instrumental music) (sirens blaring) (steps clattering) (ominous music) - [Man] So you tore up half the super sleuth. - [Man] Half of us are suffering in all of us. - [Man] That sorry son of a bitch. Got some Wild Turkey? - Sure did. - Hey look Jack, I'll have your granddaddy here in the morning. He'll get ya out. (steps clattering) (electronic music) (woman screams on television) (electronic beeping) (thuds) (groans) (slow ominous music) - What the? (dramatic music) - Fred! (sirens blare) - It's Garcia! (dramatic music) - [Man] Steiner get me outta here! Come on, move it! - What the hell's happened here? - Jesus Christ Chief, I can't believe it! - I'll check the back rooms. - Here, in the middle of town, in a police station for Christ sake! (dramatic music) - [Chief] Get these bodies in back out of sight. Clean this mess up. - But Chief, the medical examiner has to know but this. - I'll handle the medical examiner. - [Davey] Oh for Christ sake! - That's an order Davey. If either one of you breathe a word about this I'll have your ass. Now get moving. (door clatters) - Excuse me sir, phone call for you, Chief Haliburton. - I'll call him tomorrow. - He said it's urgent. - Oh, all right. I'm sorry. - If you ever change your mind about mining that valley for any reason, I want first refusal anytime. - Sorry, Golden Valley is not for sale. - Not for sale. - No, not for sale. Now good night. Hal, it's late. You want to play golf it'll have to be Thursday, not before. - [Chief] Wait, listen to me. We've got real trouble down here. - Well go on, I'm listening. - [Chief] Well, we've got real trouble down here. Some lunatic just killed two of my men, here at the station. He left a message on the blackboard, says he wants a million dollars by three tomorrow or the rich will die. I've got us covered but I don't know for how long. - Oh shit. No Hal, you did the right thing. You get over here right away. I'll call Barney, T.J. and the others. (ominous music) - [Man] I am the wind of salvation. I blow gently across the desert mother, caress her flowers, I am her life. But to you, I will be the wind of death. Do you feel something on the back of your neck? No, look around very slowly. Do you feel it? All your money will not protect you. All your friends will turn on you and then run. You will be alone before the wind. All the land you have stolen and raped will only give you up. It will not hide you. It will give you up to the wind. Others may be afraid, in fear they bow before your savage crown. They do not yet see it turn to thorns and slowly tighten. You walk nervously in your palace garden, as the clouds cover the sun. The sign says stop! Do not pick the orchid. But the wind does not read. Look around, very slowly. The wind is always the victor. Who will you send for? Who will stop the wind? Who will you send for? Who will stop the wind? - Hey, you Nick McCormick? I'm Inspector Davey. - Wolf. - I'm pleased to meet you Mr. Wolf. - Not Mr. Wolf, Mr. Heller, Wolfgang Heller. - You bet, Mr. Heller then. - Look, at all costs, we must avoid publicity. Personally, I can't afford anyone looking into my business affairs at this time, and I think the same goes for most of us. - That's a serious problem all right. But if we don't call in the authorities, we're sunk. Hey, we can't fight the bastard ourselves. - I know I don't have to tell you we're scared Mr. Whitaker, but what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do about our wives, about our children? - Barney, I'm aware of your concern. We're all in the same boat. I believe I've taken care of it. - Well gentlemen, how was the flight? - Short. - Palm Springs wasn't it? Is that where you're coming from, Palm Springs? Oh, the car's right out this way gentlemen. Yes sir, it's a great little town all right. Do you realize we have more millionaires per capita than other place in the country? That's a fact. Beautiful scenery, lots of fresh air. - Thank you Carson. I appreciate you coming on short notice. I'm William Whitaker. - Nick McCormick. This is Wolf, he works with me. - Good, need all the help we can get. Gentlemen. How was the trip? - [Nick] Short. - What'd you find out? - Not too much. He's one of those typical soldier of fortune types. - Gentlemen, this is Nick McCormick. I've taken it upon myself to call him in. He's a professional. - Now hold on Whit. I thought we agreed about outsiders. - We agreed T.J., not to involve the state police, the attorney general, the National Guard, or anything Federal. But it should be obvious to all of us that we can't or shouldn't handle this on our own. Nick here comes highly recommended. - What guarantees do we have that he'll succeed? - No guarantees. - I thought as much. - Um gentlemen, if that's what I can call you. On behalf of Wolf and myself, thank you for the plane ride. - Nick! - Later. - I'll personally guarantee your fee. We'll discuss it on the balcony. (crickets chirping) Don't worry about them, I'll handle it. What do you think we should do? - It's what you don't do that's important. I don't any of those people to talk to anybody, not even family or friends. I want you to adhere to the terrorist's every demand. I mean, no matter how crazy it may seem, even the ransom, you understand? - That's no problem, we've got the money. - [Nick] Well that's good. Incidentally, there are two ways in which I work. First one is my way. - And? - The second one's my way. - Don't worry about that, we'll back you 100%. I want you to find that extortionist and kill em. No trial, no publicity. - Seems to me that you're gonna be a prime target sir. I'd rest easier if Wolf here stayed in the house with you. - That's fine with me, I've got plenty of room. Beautiful city isn't it? - [Nick] Yeah it sure is. - I've helped create it and I'm very concerned about it. You do see my problem don't you? I hope we have a deal. - We have a deal sir. - Good. Hal will take you back to your hotel and there'll be a car standing by for you. - Good. (steps clattering) (engine revs) Something on your mind Chief? - It's just not my way of doing things. I'm a police officer. - [Nick] Don't worry Hal, you'll soon catch up. You know this joker? - TV reporter. I think his name is Jackson. - Hey you! - Talking to me mister? - Yes jackass you. Get that light outta my eyes will ya, otherwise you're gonna be wearing it home. - [Reporter] That sounds like a threat to me. - It'll be a fact if I get out of this car. Same goes for your pretty friend too. - This is Cindy Simmons Action News 13 reporting. We're on location at the home of William Whitaker. We're about to interview an unidentified man who has just come from the scene. Sir, could you tell-- - Step on it. (horn honking) - [Man] Hey! - [Woman] Hey wait a minute! That son of a bitch. He's got my microphone. Come on. - How far to my hotel? - [Hal] About 20 minutes. - Nearest bar? - About 10, give or take. - I'll take. Just cocktails please. (low lounge music) - Good evening, can I take your order? - [Nick] Yes, scotch, large, rocks and a tequila sunrise for the lady. - Certainly. (low piano music) - Just who the hell do you think you are? - I know who I am. The question is who are you. - [Waitress] Tequila sunrise for the lady and scotch rocks. Would you like to run a tab on that? - No thanks, we'll be leaving soon. Thanks, keep the change will ya. - [Waitress] Thanks, enjoy your drinks. - Well, cheers, miss? - My name is Cindy Simmons. I'm a professional news reporter. You obstructed my assignment with that little stunt you pulled back there. - Oh yeah, that reminds me, I believe I have something of yours. - You've got some nerve. - Nick, McCormick but you can call me Nick. That's yours Cindy. Will you sit please? Now then, where were we? - That's just it, we weren't anywhere. - Okay, let's start all over from the top huh, from the beginning. (sighs) - Mr. McCormick? - That's it. - Why the meeting at William Whitaker's house? I mean, why all the hush hush? - Well, it was nothing much to it really. Just a few of the boys getting together shoot a little craps, play some strip poker, you know. - I know that that's a load of bullshit. I've been investigating that bunch for months. - Investigating? Investigating what? - Land fraud. Each and every one of them is in it up to here. Now there would have been indictments by the grand jury only the star witness is no longer available. - Oh bad. - Now they don't have any real connections with the syndicate, but believe me, they operate in the same way. Nice, respectable businessmen. Around here they're known as the White Collar mafia. - Well then, the less you know about it, the better. - If there's something going on in this town, it's the public's right to know. I'm only doing my job. - Yeah, trouble is, it could be a little dangerous for you, understand? - Danger excites me, go on. Oh my God! Is that? - Loaded. Yes, it is. And if you make one move I'm gonna blow your pretty little head off. - I'm not moving. - Good girl. Good girl. You never point a weapon unless you mean it. See what I mean? (laughs) God almighty! Hey I never seen so much stuff in all my life! - [Cindy] What do you mean? - [Nick] Look at it all. Electric toothbrush, electric hairdryer, electric curlers, electric toilet paper. You got more stuff here than a party supply shop! Hey, also got a little puppy in your medicine chest. (soft instrumental music) - [Cindy] What? - [Nic] He's a cute little fella. - You sure you don't need any help? - No thanks! (laughs) I am devastating in harvest pink. - [Cindy] Devastating? - [Nick] I'm not supposed to be funny. (laughing) (ominous music) (yells) (helicopter whirring) - Yeah, Billy Martin's wife. Yeah dead. Nick's coming in now. I'll met you at the station in 40 minutes. (chirping) - What I need is some help. I mean, somebody that really knows this terrain. - I think I know just the man. (steps clattering) - Hey. Okay Tomahawk, on your feet. - Hey screw you. (clattering) - Screw you sir. Now you listen to me tough guy. You can sit here with that dumb look on your face until it rots, but the only way you're gonna get outta here is with me. Yep. - Now your grandson's bail is $500.00. This is a list of bondsmen. Maybe one of them could help you out. - Do I look like the type that would volunteer for something like this? I mean, if there's some guy running around out there blowing away the fuzz and ripping off the fat cat it's okay by me. At least in principle. - Sit down. When we were in Nam together who's side were you on then? - I was drafted, I didn't have any other choice. - Hey, what makes you think that things have changed, hm? Deputize him will ya. Open up pal. (clattering) (ominous native music) - Can I help you? - I certainly hope so. I found this early this morning in the street. - Still got money in it? 60 bucks. No drivers license, that's strange. Hollings, Hollins something, it's smeared. Well, if you just put your name and address on this envelope we'll contact you in 30 days. If nobody picks up the money it's yours. - Oh, if no one claims the wallet, give it to the police Boy's Club. - Hey wait a minute. McCall, that's it, Phillip McCall. I thought I recognized you. I was up in Denver when you won that hundred meter freestyle event. I'm Bob Steiner. I'm the coach here for the police Boy's Club team. Boy you were terrific up there in Denver. I heard talk that you were supposed to go to the Olympics. What happened? - Oh, it never worked out. - Yeah, that's tough. You know McCall, I've had a couple of kids that I thought that were really talented and there was one in particular, but when it came down to the real competition, he was just short. He didn't have it, you know. - I had it. I was never short. Good luck to you. - Thank you. - Hi, this is Victor. Whitaker, I know you. Bring one million in cash today to Devil's Mountain. Put money in backpack and drop into yellow smoke at exactly 3 p.m.. Only a madman will catch the wind, but all should try. The rich must pay or the rich will die. (wind whirring) - He said Whitaker. - He's extorting the whole city through you. Should we blow? - Is anything else missing? - No, everything was as I left it. The only thing that's missing is Dennis. (knocking) - What is this Davey? - On top of everything else, we got a missing person. Somewhere up in the Superstitions. It's her boyfriend, his name's Dennis Hollingsworth. (steps clattering) - Nick. - Miss Simmons, this young lady's lost her boyfriend. Now you could do us a big favor by interviewing her. - Nick! - Broadcast the description will ya, thanks. - Wait a minute. You son of a bitch. (fast paced adventurous music) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Nick] Here's your transmitter. There's another one with the money. - Good. Now it'll take be about 30, 35 minutes to get to Devil's Mountain. I hope that guy shows up on time, otherwise I'll have to set it down. My ships only equipped for short runs. - Well, if you want to back out, now's the time. - You must be kidding. I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Don't be a hero Whitaker. Just when you see him, drop the money, pull back out, we'll take it from there okay? - All right, good luck. - Same to you. T.J.? I want you to back him up. And don't go in until I give you a mayday, okay? - Right. Follow us. (engine whirs) - [Man] Base Station to Scarecrow, over. - [Man] Go ahead Base Station. - [Man] Has everyone left the hunt club, over. - [Man] Right, jeeps are heading southeast. We're taking up the position just beyond Devil's Mountian. Should return destination in approximately 20 minutes. - [Nick] Scarecrow at Base Station. Jeeps are now halfway point, turning northwest. - [Man] Roger Scarecrow. (helicopter blades whirring) (wind whooshing) (helicopter blades whirring) (ominous native style music) - [Davey] Mount Force to Base Station over. - [Hal] This is Base Station, go ahead Davey. - [Davey] Hal, we're turning off state nine onto the desert. (dramatic music) (ominous native style music) - Now we're shooting down at the base of Settle Rock. You know it? Now. (dramatic music) Okay, it's your turf, where would he be? - Well, it's hard to say. He could be under any one of those rocks out there. - Tracker. You are so perceptive. - Well, if I was him, I'd do the same thing. - Wonderful, absolutely wonderful. I'm glad I brought you along. - Don't mention it. (phone ringing) - Hey, according to my screen you guys haven't moved an inch in the last half hour. What's going on up there? - This is Farmer, damn near out of fuel. I'm switching over to the reserve tanks. - [Chief] Hold long is that gonna last you? - [William] 10 minutes on the outside. - [Chief] Well, hang on for as long as you can William. He'll show. (ominous native style music) (clacking) - The glasses will ya? Thanks. - You're welcome. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - There he is! He's in the yellow smoke below me. - Don't be a bloody fool. Drop the money and get the hell out of there. (helicopter whirring) - [Man] Get to the ground forces. The money's gone, move out! - Roger. (dramatic music) (hissing) (dramatic music) (clacking) (helicopter blades whirring) (beeping) - Ground force one to Scarecrow. We're in close to the base. If he can get off that mountain he's gotta come this way. (dramatic music) There he is, stop! (gun fires) (engine revs) (dramatic music) Nick, he's off the mountain getting away on a bike! - Where are you? - [Man] Up base. - Well, stay put, we're coming your way. (dramatic music) - [Nick] Get up there and spot him! Whitaker's down about four miles north of here. (motorbike revs) - Nick, he's got a good mile lead on ya. He's heading west towards Sutter's Ridge. (dramatic music) - [Davey] Base Station Whitaker's helicopter is down. We're picking him up now. - [Man] Roger Davey. Well get back to Nick as soon as you can. (dramatic music) (motorbike revs) - Hold it still! - Okay Tracker, what is this shit? - I'll tell you what this shit is. I just saved your ass. (laughing) I don't see what's so God damned funny. This wire woulda taken your head off. - Wow! - [Tracker] Don't mention it, partner. (dramatic music) - Scarecrow. This is Scarecrow pilot. I've lost him. Ditched me near the river. - [Man] Then he's probably headed for the dam. (dramatic music) - He's near the dam wall Nick. I'm setting down. (suspenseful music) (motorbike revs) (gun fires) (dramatic music) - There he is! (dramatic music) (engine revs) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (yells) - [Man] Kill that son of a bitch! (splashes) - That's the only comment I can make at this time. There'll be an official report at a later date, I'm sorry. - [Cindy] Put the camera on Whitaker. - You know Whit, that wasn't too bright an idea, switching money. The whole plan coulda backfired. - It shoulda been obvious to all of us, it was the only way to get that money back. Say, you know what your problem is Hal? You're just not a gambling man. I'm very curious as to find out who that Victor was. Well, that should be wrap for you. There's a bonus in it for ya. - I told you when I took this job Whitaker, things had to be done my way. Now you listen to me, you put ever man's life in danger out there. And as for your bonus, you can stick it. Just make sure Tracker gets something. Tell him what you want Tracker. - I want to take a hike, away from you and your friends here. Ma'am. - See you later. (laughs) (slow instrumental music) What are you doing? - Thinking. I should be mad at you you know. I don't know what I'm doing here. The way you treat me. - Yeah. - Well. - Will you let me do the thinking? - [Cindy] Okay, for now. - [Nick] You cold? Hey, there, what you think you're doing? - [Cindy] Getting even. (laughing) - [Nick] What a way. (chime dinging) (phone ringing) - Hello. Hal, hello? Hello. Hal, Hal, Hal are you there? Operator. Operator? (ominous music) Carson? (crickets chirping) (grunts) (ominous music) Carson! Carson, where are you? Wolf, Wolf, report in! (suspenseful music) Who's there? What do you want? Wolf, where the hell have you been? You're supposed to be protecting me! (ominous music) (gun fires) (booms) (ominous music) (gun clacking) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (clattering) The money's in the safe. One million dollars in cash. Take it, it's yours. It's in the den, behind the big picture. 14 left, seven right, 26 left and open. (gun fires) (door creaking) (ominous native style music) - [Man] Whitaker, you are insane. You try to double cross me, you destroy your own home. Yes, you are insane. So another must die. This will be your last chance. The price is now four million dollars. I will send details. Come alone from your palace garden, alone. Now face the floor and listen to the wind. (wind whirring) - Push, push will ya. Okay let's go. (wheels squealing) (door clacking) - Whit where are you, Whit! Oh my God. - Thanks for the ride. Whitaker. Hal get out here! Whitaker! Whitaker. - Here's something you never thought of Mr. Hotshot professional. Did it ever occur to you that that maniac has an accomplish. - God damn you Whitaker, don't you lay it off on me. If you'd have paid him like you were supposed to have done none of this would have happened. You can't spend people's lives like you spend your money. - Aren't forgetting yourself mister. - You better hope I don't. - Don't you get on your soapbox and lecture me. If I had to do it all over again, I'd do it exactly the same way because with me, it's a matter of principle! That's something a man of your profession wouldn't know anything about. With me, it's a violation of everything I believe in! - I'm not interested in politics I'm interested in doing a job. - You're interested in your precious reputation, which is as expendable to me as a teller is out there. - Then you get another boy. - No, never! You were hired to do a job. You failed. You can't quit when your back is against the wall and your ass is on the line. In that respect, you're just like me. - Wait a minute, we got a war on our hands. Never occurred to me either that he might have had an accomplice. - I wouldn't bank on that one either. (engine rumbles) - Look, I can't go through this again. I'm getting my family outta here. - Larry come here. Larry! Larry you stay and fight you chicken shit! - [Cindy] Mr. Owens, Mr. Owens! - I'll tell you anything you want to know. Listen you gotta warn everybody to get outta here before it's too late. - Go on Mr. Owens. - It's terrible, people are dying like flies and everything. - Larry! - I don't know what to do. (thuds) - Cindy, you get outta here. And you take that fag with you will ya! - Yes, yes I'll hold on. - Whitaker, those-- - Shh, it's the Governor. Well hello Jimbo. To what do I owe this pleasure? Well yes, we did have a slight problem but I assure you, it's been taken care of. We caught him. The killer is dead. Yes Governor, yes. Well Chief Haliburton is here, he'll confirm it hold on. Take it! - Hello Governor. Chief Haliburton. It's just as Mr. Whitaker explained. I'll send you a full report. Thank you sir. - Well that is it. I want out. I've tried it your pigheaded, privileged, principled way and where did it get us huh? Well you look around the room! What do you see huh? You've got to admit it Whitaker, he beat you at your own game baby. - Nick, Nick! Don't bail out on me now I need ya. I'll double your fee. - Forget it. - Pay him, it's over. (engine rumbles) - [Tracker] I figured I'd find you up here. What's happening? - How did he do it? - I don't know but I think you missed him. - Yeah, but how could anybody survive that? I mean, the fall like that? - Do you know I think I could. You know this guy really pisses me off. - Tracker? You know something if you learn to keep your mouth shut and just did as you were told, we'd make a good team. (thuds) - This time we might even catch him. (whistles blows) (marching band music) (slow distorted music) (marching band music) (whistle blows) (slow distorted music) - Innit it nice to see all these good people come out. - Yes thank you. (whistle blows) This is Cindy Simmons, Action News 15 reporting at the parade route. (slow distorted music) (groans) (yelling) (loud marching band music) (crowd screaming) (horn blaring) (motorbike engine rumbles) (wheels screeching) (sirens blaring) (crashing) - Tell me where I'm shooting darling. God damn dumb broad! Get down and get a shot. - [Woman] What's your name honey? Haven't I seen you on television - Can we get the police on that thing? - Sure can ma'am, sure can. Mayday, mayday. Handle? My handle's in my pants asshole now get off band. We're trying to get the police! Mayday, mayday! - Thank you thank you cowboy. - [Woman] She's a pretty little thing innit she honey? Little skinny, but boy she's a pretty little thing. - Will you shut up. We're gonna get a shot outta here somewhere along the way. - Which tribe is that guy from honey? - Shut your damn mouth girl. - What tribe are you from? I haven't had so much fun in my life. - I'm gonna bust his ass. (yelling) (gun fires) Oh yes! - Honey, you think that Indian's got any turquoise? - Right. Okay. Well, we can't keep it quiet any longer. The mayor just bought it on Main Street in the middle of a God damned parade with lots of witnesses. - Get Nick, bring him back. Arrest him if you have to, but get him back here! (horn blaring) (tires squealing) - [Woman] Look out! (horn blares) (crashing) Where's that beer Jay? I had a beer. You want a beer honey? - [Man] Look I ain't got time for no beer! I'm gonna waste your ass Indian! - Will you shut up!

(engine revs) - [Woman] Charlie, you remember when I was (voice cuts out). I was the best of them all! - [Man] Roger Charlie, we're coming in! (screaming) (engine revs) (rumbling) - [Woman] For crying out loud. - [Man] God damn, I'm gonna shoot him! - [Woman] Darlin I wish you'd quit smoking. Have you ever, have you ever seen your lungs? (screaming) (booms) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Man] Whitaker, the time has come to pay the wind. Bring the money to me this hour at the base of Devil's Mountain. Do not think you can cross the wind. You will be alone or you will die. - I'll be there and I'll be alone, you disgusting bastard. - You got the Scarecrow, come on. - [Hal] Tracker, where the hell are you? - Yeah, we're about three miles out on the old desert highway, what do you want? - [Hal] Is Nick with you? - Hey slow down, here's comes the chopper. - [Hal] Nick, all hell's breaking loose in town. You've gotta come back. (helicopter whirring) (tapping) - Hello Tommy? It's Whitaker. I'm fine, thanks. Hey listen, are you still interested in that land deal? Golden Valley, I've got to make a deal right away. I need three million cash. Well, I know it's worth a hell of a lot more than that but I've got myself in a jam. Now can you handle it? Thanks Tommy. - Base station to Farmer, come in Farmer. (helicopter whirring) Nick, he's heading south towards Devil's Mountain. I've got him on my screen. He won't answer me! - Scarecrow to Farmer, Scarecrow to Farmer. - Sorry Scarecrow, I've got to do this alone. - We're airborne, give us you position we're back you up. - Oh no Nick, Victor belongs to me. Now over and out. - Come in Farmer. Come in Farmer. (helicopter blades rumbling) Come in Farmer! Whitaker answer me dammit! (chanting) - [Hal] Nick, he's not moving on my screen now. He must have landed. Southeast corner of Devil's Mountain. - Victor, Victor! I've got the money, do you hear! Come down and get it. Millions! Here it is Victor! Just come and get it! (helicopter whirs) Go back! He's mine, he's not yours, he's mine! (ominous native music) - Get us up there pilot. - Hey Victor! Come on, come on down. Millions! I'm gonna make you a rich man! Come on. Come on Victor. If you want it, you're gonna have to take me too. Yeah! (gun fires) (dramatic music) (yelling) (booms) (yells) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (ominous music) - Go around behind him. Don't go until I tell you, okay? Go! (suspenseful music) (gun clacks) - I told you, he's mine! (gun fires) He's not yours, he's mine! (dramatic music) (gun fires) My money. Where's my money? Answer me you son of a bitch, tell me! Money, what'd you do with my money! You give me that money! (gun fires) (groans) (suspenseful music) - [Tracker] They're both dead. Now what? - Well, it seems to me it's gonna get hotter than hell around here next couple of hours. Maybe you and I should disappear partner. I mean before the Feds turn up and starting asking a lot of embarrassing questions. What do you say? It's like this, a man in my profession spends his whole life just looking for the one big score that's gonna take him out of this racket forever. - I think I know that you mean. - You're not really an Indian are you? - Well who are you partner? - [Woman] Excuse about it. Governor, Governor, what position will the state take regarding the citizens involved in this incident? - As far as the state is concerned, let me say that the Attorney General needs several more days in order to complete his investigation. The grand jury will hear testimony and I as Governor, personally guarantee that indictments will be handed down. That's all I can say at this time. - [Man] Governor, what about the Chief of Police, will you replace him? - I'm sorry, that's all I can say at this time. - Thank you Governor. This is Cindy Simmons reporting, Action News 13. - [Woman] Will arriving passengers Fred Gordon please go to the nearest white courtesy phone. Arriving passenger, Fred Gordon, please go to the nearest white courtesy phone. - Well, guess I better take care of one of these heavy bags. Okay partner. - [Woman] Westers Flight 15 from Denver now arriving at Gate 10. - Well, it's been different. Anything left to say? Well now, there you go. We'll do it again some time. (roaring) - Would you care for a drink sir? - Oh yeah, a scotch, rocks, tall. And a tequila sunrise for the lady please. (slow instrumental music) ("Shoot Him")
