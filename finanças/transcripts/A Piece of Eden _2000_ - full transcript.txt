(bright music) (clock ticking) (bright music) (bright music) - Is the dog away, Mr. Tredici? Is the dog away? - [Bob] This is your first week and you've been late four times. - Well- - No. I'm expecting important calls today. Please do not disconnect anybody. (sirens wailing) (phone ringing) - Television Pub (stutters) Publicity Bureau. This is Happy. Can I help you? Yes, sir. One moment, please. (dial tone humming) - Who was that? - Wrong number. (phone ringing) Television Pub (stutters). - Happy. Could you come in here for a minute? I'd like to speak to you, please. - I'll tell him. Is he a way? - Yes. Tell me, is this your first job? - Well. Yes. - And where are you from? - [Happy] Vermont. - What's your father do? - He's a new age analyst. - What's that? He incorporates Eastern religious philosophies with Freudian and Ericksonian analysis. - Would you do me a favor? Would you say Television Publicity Bureau for me? - Television Publicity Bureau. There you see? - That was very good. - I said it wrong the first couple of times on the phone and then I got so afraid of saying it again and I developed a kind of approach avoidance to it. (phone ringing) Television Publicity Bureau. This is Happy. How can I help you? One moment. It's an Aunt Aurelia. - Hey Aure, how are you? What's wrong? (soft music) Oh my God. How bad? Yeah. No, absolutely. I'm leaving immediately. I'm on my way. (soft music) - [Giuseppe] You mustn't be afraid, Bobby. Now or ever. I will always be with you and comfort you and help you. (soft music) I love you. Your father loves you and your grandma. You are our gold button. (soft music) (sheep bleating) (mountain rumbling) (soft music) - No, no. (speaking in foreign language) (soft music) Stop it, please. (soft music) What are you doing? (soft music) No. No. No. (speaking in foreign language) (soft music) Tredici. - [Clerk] I want your name, not your number. - Tredici is my name. In English it means 13. - 13 in this country is an unlucky number. - In Corsica, too. - Well, here's your chance to change it if you want to. - It's my name. - Well, I hope you have better luck in this country. - That's it. That's it. - [Giuseppe] We moved to Chicago because your grandmother had the relatives there. I got a job. It paid good, but we missed Corsica. We missed our garden with tomatoes and melons. (soft music) But you know, Bobby, God has a way of making things work out. (soft music) When your father was about your age, he found a little plant growing out of a crack in the cement. - I found a plant. (soft music) - Ah. Cork. Probably from a horse (laughs). (soft music) - Aren't we lucky? (soft music) - [Boy] It was just a plant. (train horn beeping) - [Giuseppe] So we decided to buy a farm. It took me to a place on Fail Road. I didn't like the name of the road, but I was not afraid. The house was old and the soil was sandy, but the price was right. - I'll take it. (soft music) - [Woman 1] We'll take good care of your place. - [Woman 2] It's your place now. - [Woman 1] But she's welcome to visit anytime she likes. (speaking in foreign language) - [Woman 2] She wishes you luck. - Tell her thank you. We wish her luck, too. I think we're gonna be very happy here. - Goodbye. Thank you for everything. Have a good trip. - You will cry. (soft music) - [Giuseppe] This worried your grandmother, but I said to hell with her. Come on, kids. Come on, come on, Maria. Come on, come on into the house. (soft music) And we didn't cry. We planted the big peach orchard and then an apple orchard. And your father grew up. (soft music) There were 20 seasons of perfect crops. We bought the farm next door and the one next to that. 280 acres, Bobby, and someday it will all be yours. Your father and Uncle Paulie worked with me in the orchards. (soft music) Grandma and Aunt Aurelia worked in the packing house. (soft music) Sometimes your father, he worked there too, because there was a girl he liked and she liked him, too. And that was your mother. (soft music) - What are you gonna call him? - Bob. - Bob? - It's a good name. - It's not Corsican. - [Giuseppe] You were our gold button. We counted on you, but you didn't stay. I understand how a young man wants to do something new with his life. This is not a new story. When you get older, you'll see there are no new stories, Bobby. Only different characters. Everybody's father dies. (dramatic music) - No. They gave him something. He's sleeping. - Oh my God. - He was burning the fire blight prunings with Andres. The wood was wet and Frank was impatient, so he got a can of gas. I don't know what possessed him, but he lit it with a cigarette lighter. - Had he been drinking? He was, wasn't he? (soft music) (fire exploding) (soft music) - [Gregory] At least he's alive. - [Aurelia] How's Andres? - He's okay. Some minor burns. They bandaged him up. I took him to the bunk house. - Oh, he'll never get any rest there. Bring him to my house and I'll take care of him. - He's fine where he is. You have enough to. - Maybe we should get something to eat downstairs. - Let's go home and put our feet up. We'll come back after dinner. (soft music) - Thank you for making supper, honey. - I did all the shopping, too. We've got plenty of supplies now. - [Aurelia] Well, you're a darling. - [Claire] Greg, stop it. - [Aurelia] Well honey, he's hungry. - It's a nasty habit. He needs to eat with a knife and fork. - Oh, that's all right. - Hello, Bob. How are you? - Okay, I guess. How are you? - Holding the fort. - How are your kids? - Sleeping, thank goodness. - Come and sit, Bobby. - Oh, I will in a minute. - Don't say anything to grandma. We told her that Frank is away on business. I don't know why, but no matter what awful thing happens in my life, it never spoils my appetite. - Grandma. - You? Who are you? - It's me, Bob, your grandson. - Bobby, it's you. - How you doing, sweetheart? - Oh you bad boy stay away too long. I'm so happy to see you. When you come here? - Just now. - [Maria] How long you stay? - I don't know. - Franco, he's away for a few days, but you have to wait or he think you no want to see him. You want to see him, no? - Yeah. - He hurt your feeling, but he was never mad at you. You are his gold button. You gotta make up with him and everything will be good again. Okay, Bobby? - Okay. - So what's been happening with you these days? - Business is good. You know, got a lot of new clients. How 'bout you? - Good. Very good. I've expanded the store in Chicago. - Making great money. - Can you boys afford to be here? - Well, nothing's more important than this, Aunt Aure. - He'll live. We just have to pray, that's all. - I haven't stopped praying since the moment we heard. - Who's gonna take care of the farm? - [Aurelia] I don't know. We'll manage somehow. - Me and Claire have talked this over and we're gonna move out here. Yeah, I'm gonna work with the men. Claire can help out in the store. - I've helped in the store plenty of times, haven't I? - Yes, you have, honey. But moving here? What about the children's school? - They can go right up the road. - [Aurelia] Well, that would be wonderful, but what about the market in town? - Oh, I have a manager. I mean, the farm has to go on and let's face it, someday this will be my children's and my children's children. - Whoa. Whoa. What makes you think it's gonna be your farm? - You're not interested in farming. - Well I might be. I mean, you never know with this economy. - Oh phooey. You're not gonna leave all your famous television stars and come out here to be a farmer. - I might. You never know. - So you're moving here? - Well, I don't know. It's only just occurred to me. I have to think it through. Problem is you've taken over the house. - Well, we have children. - Good, but where does that leave me? In the barn? - Honey, you can stay with me. That would be wonderful. - I know and I appreciate it, but even though I don't live here, it would be nice if I had my own room when I come to visit. - Gee whiz. Why are you making such a fuss? - Gee whiz? - Yeah. - I don't like the way you smile. - What's wrong with it? - You just do it too much. - Sorry about that. - Can't you two ever get along? - I don't have a problem with him. He's the one who always starts it. - Gee whiz. - Oh my darling, dear. - Look. Look what happened to me. Don't touch me. - You need more painkiller? I'll get the nurse. - [Bob] I'll get her. - Bobby, stay. Gregory, you go with Aurelia. Tell the nurse. - Yeah, sure thing. Stay away. Five minutes. I wanna talk to Bobby. - Okay. We'll go for coffee. - Dad. I'm sorry for what I said. - It doesn't matter. I love you. - I love you, too, Dad. - Someone's gotta take care of the farm. - Oh, we'll do it. Don't worry. You just get better. - I'm turning it over to Gregory. - What? You can't be serious. The whole thing? What are you? Dad, how could you do that? - He's the right one for the job. He likes growing things. - So do I. - Yeah Bob, what you like to grow is marijuana. - Oh, come on, Dad. I was just a kid. It was one plant. - Don't make me laugh. - Jeez, Dad. That really hurts my feelings. - Excuse me for a moment. - Bobby, you live in the city. You chase fame and fortune and women. Gregory goes to church. He is married with kids. - Well, so am I married. And my wife's pregnant. And you know, we've been thinking about getting out of the city and living a sane life. - Wish I could believe you. - No, I'll bring her here. You'll see. - You're such a terrible liar. - I'm not lying. - [Happy] You need someone who knows you pretty well to pull that off. I mean, why would you ask me? - 'Cause you're nice and you're intelligent and lady like and I know that my father would like you. - But I don't know a thing about you. - You know, it's nothing you couldn't learn in 10 minutes. Trust me. - I don't lie well. I hate it. - No, no, no. You wouldn't have to. You'd just be the quiet type. (soft music) - [Franco] Oh God. - [Aurelia] What is it, honey dear? - I want a cigarette. - Well, you can't have one. For heaven sakes, Franco, your lungs were seared in the fire and you have to get well. I need you. - Hey, how you doing, Uncle Frank? I told Dean to spray the chestnuts. - Oh good. Good, thank you. - Hi. This is my wife. Happy. - Yes, I'm happy. We're very happy. I'm glad to see you. What is your name, dear? - [Bob] Happy. - Happy. - I'm Greg. Nice to meet you. - My cousin. - Look how pretty she is, Frank. - Come closer. - I'm awful sorry about your accident. - Are you Catholic? - No, sir. Buddhist. - Hm? - Botanist. She's a botanist. - Oh, botanist. Very good. You like plants? - Very much. - Like to grow things, do you? - [Happy] Yes sir. - Not marijuana I hope. - Jesus, Dad. - No, sir. I don't do drugs, Mr. Tredici. I don't smoke or drink. My body's a temple of my soul and I treat it with respect. - You're a nice girl. I can see that. - Now, I have two beautiful nieces. - I saw sheep. - What? - Before. A flock of sheep outside the window. - Dad, we're on the sixth floor. How could you see sheep? - I saw them. - It's the medication, Franco. You're hallucinating. - I saw them. You don't look pregnant. - She's only a couple of months pregnant. You know it doesn't show yet, but she's got terrible morning sickness. - Terrible. - What? You had to get married? - Frank. - No, sir. - Well, how long you been married? - Frank, for heaven sake. - Five months, Dad. We're married five months. She's three months pregnant. So you know. - Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying. - No, you're not. They're gonna fix you up. Don't worry. - I heard the doctors in the hall. I'm dying. Cancer. - You're a burn victim. They were talking about another patient. He's hearing things. - I heard them. - They weren't talking about you. - We gotta get the market painted too and ready to open. - No, no, no, don't paint it. It looks good the way it is. You know, it's got a rustic appeal. I mean, that's what we're selling, right? In fact, why don't we plant some corn out front this year? - No, we always have flowers. - No, no, no. Keep the flowers, but add some decorative stocks of corn, you know, to look festive when the leaves turn colors. - What the devil? What next you're gonna want to have a old covered wagon on the lawn. - Yeah, why not if it bring in customers. I mean, why not a petting zoo? Why not fishing? You know, miniature golf for the bored husbands. - What ideas? - Aunt Aurelia, I'm in the publicity business. I get paid for my ideas. You're getting these for free. - [Gregory] This isn't show business. It's a farm. - I don't want any changes right now. Not any. - So. How'd you guys meet? - I answered the want ad for secretary for the public (stutters). - And it was love at first sight. - That's great. - So where did you get married? - City hall. - I don't know why you didn't tell us. We could have had it in the rose garden. - Yeah, we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Besides, it's not the ceremony that matters as much as the bond between us. - My darling new niece. Welcome (laughs). Welcome to my humble abode. Is there anything you need, Happy? - No ma'am, I'm fine. Thank you. - Well, you're a darling girl. And I am happy that you're one of us now. You know where everything is. - You are doing great. - She's so sweet. I hate lying to her. - Yeah, me too. I mean, I hate lying to my father, but he's left me no choice, you know. - I'm sleeping there? - No, no, no. You take the bedroom. - Okay well, I'm exhausted. So. Goodnight. - Okay. I wanna know what you think of Greg. - You guys are so different. You know he's- - Oh, he's what? He's handsome. He's wholesome. He's earnest. He's honest. Not something that crawled out from under a rock like me, right? - No. - Are you attracted to him? No, because if you are it would be very bad. - No, no, no, I don't. I don't get any sexual vibrations from him at all. - Don't say sexual vibrations 'cause it gets me all like worked up. You know what I'm saying? - Goodnight, Mr. Tredici. - Stop calling me that. - Goodnight, Bob. (hand knocking) - [Paulo] What's up? - Problems, Dad. - Hey, keep your voice down. I got company. What's the matter? Is it, Franco? - No, he's burned pretty bad, but he'll live. - It's his own damn fault. He was drunk, wasn't he? - Yeah. - Jesus, all the flowers he grew to fight his alcoholism. What does the idiot do? He gets drunk and sets himself on fire. - I think you should see him. - The day he bought me out he ceased being my brother. - No, Dad. You should see him and make amends because Bob came back. They made up. - [Paulo] Yeah? - [Gregory] Got a wife for himself, too. And he wants to give up show business to become a farmer. - What's he gonna do? Till the soil in his blue suede shoes? - Yeah, but what if he proves he can do it huh? I'm sure Frank would rather leave it to his son then to yours, and I'll be out and he'll ruin the farm. - Well don't piss and moan. Do something about it. - Yeah but what? - [Woman] Paulie, Paulie. - Listen, I gotta go before my Viagra wears off. See yourself out when you finish your coffee, okay? - Yeah sure, Dad. - Are you, Mr. Tredici? - Yeah. What can I do for you? - I'm delivering your new computer system. - My what? We better check this. - No, no, no, no, no. That's for me. Hey, thanks for getting here with such short notice. I'll sign this. - What is this? - We're bringing the farm into the modern age. - Hey, hey. How much does this cost? - Nothing compared to the benefits we're gonna reap. Look, all you have to do is type in the name with the address and the zip code, then the computer will do the rest. - I'm not good with machines. - Just pretend it's a typewriter. Nothing to be scared of. - [Girl] Can we play with it? - You can play with nothing on this machine ever. In fact, neither of you can even come into this room. - What are you talking about? This is the house. - Yes and it is now also my office, so it is off limits to kids. - [Happy] It'd be better to keep the children away from the expensive equipment. - How expensive? - Never you mind. It'll pay for itself in one good day of business. - Oh listen. We're against any additional expense at this time. You pull on our belts and keep an even keel. - [Bob] Yeah aside from fruit, what else do we sell? - Jelly, honey, chestnuts. - That's it? Customers drive 80 miles and that's it? These people are in a buying mood. I mean, we should have trail mix, herbs, spices. - Scented candles, cheeses. - The customers will never buy things like that. - Yes, they will. They'll buy whatever's there. - Yeah, but first we have to buy it and that costs money. - And that's a short term investment, which you'd mark up 100%. - [Gregory] Oh gouge our customers. They'll never stand for it. - How do you know unless you try? - You'll ruin us. - I will turn this into a competitive moneymaking operation. We have to just spend a few bucks first. - Your father would never allow it. - Yeah, well he already gave me his permission. - Yeah well, I don't believe that. - Well, I talked to him yesterday and he gave me carte blanche. - Bullshit. - Bullshit, go ask him. - Oh, I will. - All right, call New York. Call the Broadway costume shops. - What's the matter with you? - What? - Let him spend all he wants. - No, he's lying. Frank would never. - So what? It's better. Let him spend everything and fail. - Yeah, but if he succeeds? - He'll fail. - Yeah hi, Bob Tredici for Victor Hardwick please. Sure. How 'bout Victor Hardwick? - Who's he? - [Bob] Don't you watch the "Young and the Restless"? He plays Brett Davis. - Brett Davis. He's the sexiest man alive. - No, I'm the sexiest man alive. - Mr. Hardwick, Mr. Hardwick. It's Bob Tredici. - [Director] Oh for God's sake, cut. - Robert? - Hey Victor, how you doing? Are you free to fly somewhere on September 7th? - Why? - They're putting together a farm aid thing in LaPorte County, Indiana asking celebrities to lend support. - Well who have they got? - It looks like Waylon is working into his schedule. Also Willie Nelson. Quite a few day time actors who were in sympathy with the plight of the American farmer have volunteered support. - Look Robert, I think this is something you should run by my agent. Don't you? - Oh look, you should kiss my ass for giving you the publicity, which wouldn't hurt by the way since you videoed yourself with the teenagers. Hey look, I got the other line waiting. You wanna do this thing or not? - Sure. Count me in. - Beautiful. I will call you back with the details. I love you. Goodbye. - How can you lie so easily? - Practice. Yeah, you know. I'm not certain that we should say the winner will have Victor Hardwick. I think we better specify the winner will have dinner with Victor Hardwick. - Oops. (hand knocking) - Just married and sleeping on the couch, huh? - Yeah, she's sick to her stomach. - I can imagine. The hospital bed has arrived. You want it in here? - No, I think Frank would like to sleep in his own house. Don't you? - Okay. - Gosh. - Sh. He's suspicious. He saw me on the couch. - [Happy] Well they're bound to. - Yeah but you know, they never see any affection between us the way married people do. - [Happy] That is the way married people do. You never see any affection between Greg and Claire do you? - Yeah, well they hate each other. We're supposed to be newlyweds. - We are not sharing a bed, Bob. - No, I know. But couldn't we at least hold hands in public. (soft music) (singing in foreign language) See the beams? Not a nail in it. See the ax marks? (singing in foreign language) You sleep here. I'll rig something for privacy and I'll sleep all the way over there, all right. What do you say? - I wouldn't feel safe. I mean, what if the insane son of the farmer- - I am the insane son of the farmer. Okay? - Mr. Tredici, how long am I gonna be here? - As long as it takes. - But what your business? - Well. I mean, we have the computer here. Let's operate out of here. I'm sick of New York anyway, you know? You know, I mean I act like I'm doing well, but the truth is I'm barely scraping by. - I was wondering about that. - I'm going to town. Want me to mail them? - Yeah great, thanks. I'll be ready in a second. - I don't know how we're gonna do if the weather doesn't change. We absolutely have to spray today if we're gonna open on the seventh. - Why? - Laws regulating the amount of time before the fruit can be eaten. They don't wanna poison people. - Do you have to spray? - You think the customers want worms? - Or maybe there wouldn't be any worms. - There's one born every day. - Well, people are concerned about their health about what's seeping into the ground water, about the whole environmental issue. I certainly am. Sometimes I wake up here and just see how beautiful it is. The orchard, the rose garden, the birds singing. And it just makes me wanna cry. - Why? - Because I can see the inevitable destruction of the planets. - You like my farm? - It's beautiful. - Someday it will be yours and you can do whatever you like. And someday it will pass to the little Tredici in your belly. Tell me how much did Bobby tell you about the family curse? - Curse? - I knew it. They never do. You have a right to know. You want to know? My husband's grandfather. He was famous throughout Corsica for his advice. If someone's calf was stillborn, he was the first one to tell them what he did wrong. If a man's wife ran away, he knew why. He was the authority. Everybody hated him. So. One day his boat overturned in the storm and he drowned. A lot of people took credit for putting the malarkey on him. So his son took over the fishing business and he drowned too and then an uncle. He got hit on the head with a sail and it made an idiot of him forever. So they took up livestock and the cows. It was good for awhile until they went over the cliff. But then we come to America and our luck changed. Things is good here. - So you think the curse is gone? - Sh. You mustn't say that or it sneaks up on you. (soft music) - [Woman] And with the sensitive pads of the fingers, press down gently with a massaging motion so you can feel deep breaths. - [Nurse] Oh good evening, Mr. Tredici. - They show this on TV? - How are you feeling tonight, Mr. Tredici? - Much better, thanks. - [Woman] There are three generally accepted methods. - Do you do that? - [Nurse] What? - Examine yourself. - [Nurse] Of course. Every woman has to, although many don't. - Well you know, I might be able to help. - I don't think you're feeling that good yet, Mr. Tredici. Take your pills. - [Woman] Carefully starting from the outside and working your way inward until old breast tissue is examined. With palms on your hips, press down firmly and flex the chest muscles. Once again, looking for changes or dimpling of the skin. (soft music) - Thanks. - Is everything okay on the farm? - I can only pray for the best. - Thank you God you have Greg. - Oh yeah. Bob's back. He's doing the best he can. - But he don't know shit about farming. - Of course he does. He grew up there. He had a wonderful garden as a kid. He loved it. - He loved it so much he left as quick as he could. - Yeah, but maybe now he wants to leave show business. Make an honest living. - Hey, anything is possible I guess. But listen, if you're willing to put aside old grievances, I'd be glad to come back and help you in the meantime. - I don't wanna talk about old grievances. - Hey, no matter what happened, you're my brother. - Let's not get into it. You came to visit me and I'm glad. - I love you, Frank. I didn't plow your flowers to hurt you. - No? - Of course not. I know you're only planting them to save yourself from alcoholism and I was all for it at first, but you got carried away with it and I understood, but you were wasting a lot of time and money and land on it. That's all. And I thought I had to get rid of them. Know what I mean? - That garden wasn't your business, was it? You were the younger brother. I made the decisions. That garden meant salvation to me and you plowed it out. - For your own good and the good of the farm. - Bullshit. - All right, all right. Let's not get into it, Franco. You know, I came here out of the goodness of my heart. - Goodness of your heart? - Come on, come on. - You want me to die. You want me to die. And leave it to Greg so you could have it all. - [Paulo] I knew I shouldn't have come. - I'm dying dammit. - Hey, we're all dying from the minute we're born. It's just a question of when. - These are the words of comfort you bring me. - You know, if you weren't laying in that bed all scarred up from a drunken accident, I'd punched the shit out of you. - Just try it. (speaking in foreign language) - The important thing is not to show fear. We who are about to die salute you. (bees buzzing) Ow, ow, ow. Oh no. Oh, oh, oh. Oh shit. Oh, oh, oh. - How's this? - Aw. Excellent choice. You know, I've always hated these things. They're a barrier to all the manageable delights. - Like this? - However, these main part of sweet nectar. - Excuse me, they're clean. - That's a pity. Just hold that there. Oh yeah. - Oh. It's not going through. Here. Oh my goodness (laughs). - Oh no, let both legs go. I could lick that off. It's in your way. Now watch out for that because that. (woman laughing) Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh, that's one of my bee stings. - Oh, oh, oh. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, you gotta stop this. - I'm so sorry (screams). - Ah. (woman screaming) (soft music) - Wish they'd both drown. (woman screaming) (soft music) (soft music) - No. (soft music) (gentle music) - Oh thank goodness. I prayed so hard. - Welcome home, Uncle Frank. - Hi Dad. Hang in there. - Bring him in the kitchen door. - Careful. - Gracias. - How are you? - Okay, no problem, boss. - You saved my life. (singing in foreign language) Careful. Careful. - I told you to bring him in the other door. (singing in foreign language) - Oh, I'm seeing things. (singing in foreign language) Ah. - And then right in here. (singing in foreign language) - My God. Ah. Ah. Ow. I saw sheep. - Yeah. - No, I really saw them. - I told you I was expanding. - There they are. - [Bob] Yeah. - [Franco] They're real. - [Bob] Yeah. - Oh, that's good. I thought I was hallucinating. - [Aurelia] Everybody out now. Let him get some rest. - What are they doing here? - Well honey dear, they're family. - Not them. The sheep. Why are the sheep here? - They're for our petting zoo. - [Franco] I don't want sheep. - Oh no. The customer's kids are gonna love 'em. - Nah, son. The Tredici's have a tragic history with sheep. - Isn't it time we changed all that? - I won't have them here. - It's just a few of them. - [Franco] They're eating my roses. - Take it easy, Dad. Don't get upset. It won't be a problem. We can slaughter them for the meat. - Bob. - [Franco] What else has been going on in my absence? - [Aurelia] Take it easy, Frank. - What about that stuff in the pantry? Is that a hallucination or did I see a computer? - Oh no. That we need. - [Franco] How much did it cost? - Altogether? 10,000. - 10,000? Oh, I hate to see you spend your hard earned money. - I charged it to the farm. No, but I'll reimburse you. And then with the increased sales, we make it back in no time. Plus, it is a tax deductible business expense. - Get out of my house you son of a bitch. - Dad. - [Franco] Get out of my house. - Calm down, Frank. Don't talk business and let him get his rest. - [Franco] And you. You allowed him to do this? - I? - No, you told me I could expand. - [Franco] I never said a thing like that. - Franco? - [Bob] I'm not yelling. Listen, let me explain how this is gonna work. - There is no explanation. I want that crap out of the pantry and you get the money back in full. - [Maria] Franco? - Oh mama. Mama. - What's this? What? Ah. - Don't touch me. - What happened to you? - I caught fire. - Oh my God. My God. (speaking in foreign language) - No, no. Mom, don't be ridiculous. It has nothing to do with that silly curse. It was just that Frank was being stupid, that's all. - Please God, why you do this? Why? He's not perfect but he's a good boy. Please. - I'm not gonna die, Mama. Please don't cry. - Please and let him live. (speaking in foreign language) I beg you. Lift this curse from the name of Tredici. Take me. - [Franco] Mama. - I'm old. Take me. (speaking in foreign language) - Grandma. - I told you we should have told her. - He's gonna be okay. The doctor said he will be fine really. - Yeah? - Yes, I promise you. Just take it easy. Here. Look, blow your nose and then smile for me. Okay? Just. It's okay. Stay calm. - Sheep. Sheep. - This is your fault. - Hey dad, I didn't set you on fire. You were drinking. - Who told you that? - Well, you were, weren't you? - Please somebody get him out of here. I'm too sick for this. - Hey, you know, I've been doing my best since I got here. I'm sorry if it's not good enough. - That's true, Frank. He's been working his fingers to the bone. - Let him work them to the bone in New York. Let him make a big success in his own stupid business. - It's always gonna be like this, isn't it? - Because you don't have sense that God gave a chicken. - God, I don't need this. - Come on, the man is sick. Don't agitate him. - Hate this farm. - [Aurelia] Bobby. - No, you know, but I'm here and I have been since your accident fighting to keep things going. And it hasn't been easy, but I don't mind. In fact, I've enjoyed it because I'm doing it for you. - Okay. That's good. Thank you. I'm home now. You can go. - That's it. (sheep bleating) (soft music) Hello? Do you work here? (soft music) Grandpa? (soft music) (gentle music) - [Woman] I have to go. You see, it's time. - [Man] But I need that, darling. I need that. I need to go. - What? - [Happy] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. - Crank me up. Where's Aurelia? - She'll be right back. - Bob? - He went for a walk. - Good. Let him walk to New York. - Please, Mr. Tredici, don't send him away. He loves you so much. - You'd never know it. - If you'd been there when he heard about your accident you'd know. He was beside himself with worry. - Is that why he's trying to ruin me? - He's trying the best he can to help you and neglecting his job in New York to do it. He's got such great ideas. Don't you see? His heart's in the right place. - I don't wanna talk about it. It'd be better if the two of you go. - What? You think I'm wrong? - I think you're a little hard on him. - Well, what would your father say in his new world analysis? - He'd say that while the rest of the world was going mad with wars and killing, the trees your father planted went on quietly growing. - Is grandma okay? How's dad? - Exhausted. What do you expect after all that? You better leave him alone. - I need to talk to him. - Stay out of his hair. - I won't upset him I promise. - Oh, it's you. - Can I just to you for a second? - Go ahead. - I'm sorry I yelled at you. Are you okay? - I'm alive. Go on. - I didn't do anything in defiance of you. I honestly thought you gave me permission to expand. - I don't recall that. - Maybe with the painkillers you don't remember, but you said I should go ahead. - So it's my fault? - No. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying. Look, maybe I misunderstood you and if you did, I'm sorry, but can you just wait and see if what I'm trying to do works? - You took advantage of me in a drug state just like you're trying to do now. - Is that what you think of me? - I don't know what to think. - Let me tell you something, Dad, all my life, my whole life- - You hated me. - No, you. I loved you. No, you don't have to be embarrassed about it, okay? It's just my whole life I've loved you. - Then why did you leave? - Because I wanted to do something else with my life. - Then why don't you ever come back? - Because every time I try to, no matter how much I look forward to seeing you, it just turns out lousy. - That's not true. We've had some great times. - Dad. I'm failing in New York. This is all I have. - I'm sorry to hear that. I could see why if that's the way you spend. - Do you think we could just stop fighting? Listen. Can you see that I'm grown up now and that I'm at a time in my life when I can help you? - You never should have gone into that stupid business to begin with. - Why do you hate me? - I don't. You're my only child and I wish the best for you. I want you to be happy and protected because I love you. But it just sticks in my craw that when I'm dead you'll still be alive. - That's great. Great. You want me to leave? - Nah. See if it works. Money's already spent. - Yeah good. It will. - So you say. No more spending. - No, I'm done. - No more lies. Nothing concealed. You understand? Don't make me a fool. - I won't. Thanks, Dad. I won't let you down. - And hang on to that girl. She believes in you. (soft music) - Beautiful. (soft music) Now remember this guy is doing us a favor and he's used to absolute star treatment. Top of the line. Guys like Victor Hardwick don't hear the word no for years on end, so whatever he wants make him happy.

Stay off of them. - What are these? How could you do this? - Well, I was embarrassed by the damn things. Begging people to come. - You moron hick shit. What have you done to us? - I saved us $3,000 postage. Yeah money we desperately need with you spending every cent we have. - We open in a day. We're not gonna have any customers. - We'll have plenty. People know us. They don't need your stupid brochures. Hey, what are you? Get out of here. - [Bob] This isn't about saving money. No, you want the farm. (bright music) (upbeat music) (bright music) - Gregory. Gregory, look out. Gregory. - Excuse me, Gregory. Gregory, we're in the road. We're in the shit. We're in the road. Get off the pedal. (tires screeching) (horn blaring) (bright music) - Victor, my man. How you doing? Good to see you. Thanks for coming. - [Victor] Well, isn't this wonderful? - You all right? - Bob Tredici was to meet me here. Is he around? - Hello Victor. It's me for Christ sake. - Bob, it is you. Where's the amphitheater? - Where do you want this? - Put it in my trailer. - No, no trailer. No, we assist you use the house. Really. It's much more comfortable. Come in, meet my dad, relax, have a drink. - A drink? A drink would be nice. - Did he try something with you? - Sort of. - And? - Nothing. - Have you been drinking? - You told me to make him happy. - Yeah well I didn't want him making happy. - Oh Bob, nothing like that. - Well no, you think he's the sexiest man alive, don't you? - You coming? - Yeah, right there. Talk to you later. Victor, come on, my man. - I'm sorry, Uncle Frank, but this isn't gonna work out. - Upstairs. Kids, pack your things. - [Franco] What? - We're going back to Chicago. - Everything was fine until Bob- - Dad, this is Victor Hardwick. He's here from New York to help us out. - Pleasure to meet you, sir. - Don't touch me. Little accident, huh? - I caught fire. This is my farm. I planted those trees with my father when I was young boy. - [Andres] Boss. - What's the problem? - The apples are dropping. - Well why don't you pick them? - (speaks in foreign language) The men, they quit. My brothers don't work here no more. Say very bad luck. - Don't say bad luck. I don't wanna hear the words bad luck in this house. - Bob, you better come outside. - What now? - The guy in the truck wants to know where you want the fish? - What fish? - What do you wanna do with the ice cream? - Give it to the customers that eat it with the pie. - [Worker] What customers? - What pie? - They just delivered 300 cherry pies and I don't know how many gallons of ice cream and there is no one to eat it. - Where are all the people? - Well the brochures never went out 'cause he- - What brochures? - You never begged for customers in your life before and you're not starting now. - [Victor] Maybe you're not quite ready for me yet. - Vic, you know what? Just give me a second to sort this all out. - [Victor] Not a problem. - [Bob] Thanks. - [Victor] Maybe your assistant could show me around. - What assistant? - This beautiful creature with chestnut hair and rosebud lips. - It's him. Brett Davis, the stinker. You put the nice girl in the cellar and you divorce your wife. - Not I, toots. Merely the character I play on the "Young and the Restless". Happens all the time. - Don't count on my nose people, but them fish are dying. - I don't like that. What's he mean charming with rosebuds? He's trying to get into her pants. - Whose pants? (singing in foreign language) What a stinker. (singing in foreign language) - The ice cream is melting. - Put it in the freezer. - It won't come on. - Oh for God's sakes. - Handmade beams. See the ax marks? They're all pegged together. Not a single nail. (soft music) - How's Frank doing? - Better, but it's hard on him. - You've made a lot of changes here. - We certainly have. We've got jams and honeys. All sorts of things. - But there's no apples. (soft music) - Who sleeps here? - Bob. - Two beds and a curtain in between. Kinky. You're one hell of a woman, Mary Lou. - Happy. - Me too, but not as happy as we could be. - Mr. Hardwick, these people think I'm married to Bob. - Oh? - And if his father sees you coming on to his daughter in law. Well he's Corsican you know. - He gonna shoot me? - They take that stuff seriously. - I tremble with fear. - Stop it. You're here to help not to fool around. - I wanna help. I believe in farm aid but where are the preparations? Where are the press? Where are the people? I mean, where's Willy? Where's Waylon? I have a strong suspicion that this is the farm that I'm here to aid. Where you going? - To pick apples. - We're gonna start a cherry pit spitting contest in 10 minutes. Can I have some people up here, please? Hey, y'all look like a spitter over there. Come on, join us, come on. We're gonna have points for accuracy, points for distance, and points for most disgusting. The winner gets dinner with Victor Hardwick from the "Young and the Restless". Everybody get up here and grab a handful. Let's get your pits ready, come on. Grab a handful here, everybody. - Please, can't we stay and fish? - I don't wanna leave the farm. - [Claire] Shut up. (soft music) I hate your family. They practically kill me and they don't even care. They don't even care. - [Boy] Please, can't we stay- - [Claire] Shut up. They don't care. (soft music) Where are we going? (soft music) - [Paulo] What's up, son? - I did something really stupid. - Yeah, what's new? Just kidding, just kidding. What happened? - Beautiful girl, aye? - Yeah, before you got any ideas, she's my wife. - You're not married. - They certainly are. - Course you are. Just kidding (laughs). (bright music) (crowd applauding) - Franco, people are spitting out there. - Yeah, that's the cherry pit spitting contest. - Disgusting people spitting the fruit. They should respect it. This is no game. It's a food. (bright music) (crowd applauding) - Am I glad to see you. - Okay, come and get 'em. - Oh my God, it's Victor Hardwick. - My sister is not gonna believe this. (women chattering) - How much we take in? - 220 give or take. - That's it? - Better hurry. We need more. - Okay, let's go. (soft music) (singing in foreign language) Uh oh. - Who's he with? - His father. (singing in foreign language) Hello. - This is really nice. - Hi, Deborah Hall from channel 16 in South Bend. - Sorry to keep you waiting, but we've been bringing in the harvest. - Where would you like to do the interview? - Well, how 'bout out here? I mean, let's get the sign. Get the market, get the apples. That's great, yeah. - You don't seem the type for a job like this. - I'm very ambitious. - Good. - [Deborah] Do I look all right? - [Cameraman] You look great. We're rolling. - All right. We're here today with Victor Hardwick, star of the "Young and the Restless" who's actually being a farmer today. - You know Deborah, I've been all around the world, but you know, I never had apples quite like this. Tree ripened. Mm. That's wonderful. You know, fruit like this never makes it to the city. It's too sweet and it's too ripe to travel. You just won't find apples like this in the supermarket because they're picked too green. Try this. - Right, that is good. (soft music) (crowd applauding) - All right, folks. The moment has arrived. We have a winner of the grand prize in the cherry pit spitting contest. Dinner at our expense with the star of the "Young and the Restless" Victor Hardwick. (crowd cheering) And the winner is at an incredible 68 feet two inches, Big Jack Hurley of Union Mills. Come on down here, Jack. Congratulations. All right, there you go. Say a few words. - I'm hungry. Where's my prize? - Victor. Hang on here, Jack. - Let me tell you about the ways of the law. - Vic. Victor. Victor, wait up. - Is he coming back? - Why, do you want him to? - Once is enough. - [Paulo] All right, let's go. - [Franco] How much did we take in? - 900, but it would have been more if the brochures had gone out. - Yeah, you wouldn't have had apples for them anyway. You need more pickers. - Yeah but where? - Well, you better start shaking. - Oh, the shaker's not quite working. - [Franco] No? - No, it developed some hydraulic type problems during the chestnut harvest. Paulo was here today. - He didn't come in here. - Well, he was picking. You know, I think he feels bad. - He should have talked to me. - You awake? - [Bob] Mm hm. - [Happy] I feel like we accomplished something today. Don't you? - Yeah, but the fruit is dropping. - [Happy] People are still coming. I mean, they never advertised before. Now it's a customers sort of thing. - Yeah, we took in a little more than they usually make on opening day. But you know those were old customers. They weren't too interested in the fancy, new, extra things I brought. Spent all this money. I was hoping we'd pull in a lot more. - Well maybe tomorrow they will. There's no use of worrying about it now. Every muscle in my body aches. - Mine, too. You know, you were really something today. In fact, I think you're something all the time. I think you're wonderful. - [Happy] Oh no. What do you want now? - A kiss. (soft music) - [Aurelia] Bob, wake up. Bobby. - What's wrong? - You have to do something. Look outside. (horns blaring) (phone ringing) - Tredici flu farm. Fruit farm. Yes, we do. Yes we are. Victor Hardwick? No, he left yesterday, but he'll be back today. - [Franco] They're showing it on CNN. It's been on twice already. - [Bob] They went national. We're gonna have a million customers. - [Aurelia] And no apples. - [Franco] Paulo. - How you feeling? - You come to help? - You need us, don't you? - You got cars lined up halfway down the road. We don't have enough apples picked. We're gonna have a riot. - [Aurelia] Oh no. - Boss, lot of people. - Well, we're just gonna have to buy apples from our competitors. I'm getting on the phone. - [Franco] Can't find any men (speaks in foreign language)? - Si, two was coming this morning. Paro they don't. - Oh paro, this is a nightmare. - Let me pass this by you, Frank. I've got some inmates I can bring. Good pickers, especially the shoplifters. - No thanks. - [Paulo] No, no. I'm just kidding. These guys are on good behavior. - Good heavens, what an idea. - Why not? How else we gonna get the crop picked? - [Happy] I have an idea. - Dad. Dad. - What? - Come on, you gotta come see this. - I just don't think we should forget we're in the fruit business. - What do you think they're buying? - It's always about the fruit. Now you got fishing, spitting contest and sheep. Like you brought show business into it. - It's what I do. Are you telling me you're not pleased? - It's good. It's good. I just got to adjust.

Buy yourself something nice. (soft music) - Hey, I was watching that. - Shut up. How much, Franco? - 8,900. - Good heavens. - Five times more than we ever took in. - Well, you pick was Happy's idea. - [Happy] Yeah but he put the ads- - I'll see you a store in the city. - You make a good team.
