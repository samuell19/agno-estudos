Yeah, the same guy! -Yes, it's him. He's gone to town and will be back by the 5:30 p.m. boat. It's time I see him up and close! We can't blame him completely.

Isn't it very cold in America? Would you be able to manage there? My dear Hari, do you think I will ever make it big here? True. -Bincy is also of the same opinion. -What? If I make it big in America, it will be easier for me to convince her parents. Oh, okay. After the wedding, we plan to settle in America. Tailors are in great demand there. Not many know how to sew there. -Because they use readymade there! -That's true. Look at this! This is American, Abibas! Now there is a duplicate for this too.

And just, leave me alone! -Okay! -Okay! Bincy! -What will we do? -Oh, God! What is she doing inside? -Maybe she is sleeping? -Don't be stupid! Bincy! Why are you not answering? I was praying! You? She is very religious, you know! Really? -She would pray five to six times a day. -My goodness! Aneesh should know about this. That's why I am telling you. You have a conversation. Let me speak to Santa Claus. You carry on, Daddy. Bincy, are your prayers for me? -Yes. -Really? After we get married, we will pray together! I have a lot of dreams, about our life together.

She ran away with that lorry driver Satheesh. Rumor has it that she is pregnant! -Really? -How tragic? -When did this happen? Is it true? -Yes. She pretended to be the Virgin Mary! Jaison, you have to promise me. What is it, sweetheart? Promise me that you will never leave me! Would you? For that to happen, Jaison has to die! For that to happen, I have to die! Your Aneesh has to die! You stupid Aneesh! You are a fool! A stupid fool! She fooled me. She will fool you. and this entire village too! If she finds another rich guy, she will go after him, as well! -I will finish him today! -No, wait! What did you say?

You and these wretched people that don't give a shit about me -will one day, beg for my benevolence! -You! -Mark my words! -You son of a bitch! No, please don't! Let me go. Don't try to stop me, you half-witted fellow! Don't think you can scare me by flashing that gun! For this not to happen, Jaison has to die. This Jaison has to die! Uncle! You shot him? How would I possibly fire this gun? There are no bullets in it! See? Stop wasting time! Someone, please take him to the hospital. Lift him up. Carefully, carefully! This old man is still loitering here? Go away! Hurry, hurry. Where do you think you guys are going? Move aside! The sparkling stars from the sky Sent a lightening to the earth Which fell upon the man With a daring heart Just step onto the brake for me. I will be back, quick! Did you guys know?

Oh, my lord! -What happened to my dear brother! -Stop crying! Stop here! That would be enough Take him out, quickly! I will get the stretcher. -Stop right there! -Where do you think you're going? You cannot sing carols here. This is a hospital! My dear doctor, we are not here to perform! Santa Claus got struck by lightning! Can you please arrange for a stretcher? Didn't you hear that Santa got electrocuted? -Please get it quickly! -Go get it! Call the doctor! The sparkling stars from the sky Sent a lightening to the earth Which fell upon the man With a daring heart Doctor! There is a patient who got struck by lightning! -What? -A patient got struck by lightning! Oh, God. Come fast! My stethoscope. Oh, the electric shock has bloated his internal organs! Move him! He needs to be operated on! Doctor, that's a pillow tied around his stomach! Really? Oh, dear! He should get CPR. -Where is Jaison? -Over there. -What happened to Jaison? -Mommy! Uncle got struck by lightning! -He is inside. -What really happened? He is over there! Wake up. Who beat you up, this time? If someone gets struck by lightning, an enormous power in the scale of megawatts enters his body. -Isn't it? -Correct! Cardiac arrest, lung failure, spinal cord damage, and chronic burns. By God's grace, nothing of that sort has happened! All of this would have happened, though! So nothing happened? Why, should something have happened? Do we have to find out if something has happened? We will have to take an ECG. -Isn't it? -Correct! Yes. -Nothing happened? -Yeah, nothing happened! -Nothing happened. -Let's go! Cancel the funeral arrangements. -What about the food? -Don't cancel that! Jaison, hurry up. -What happened to you, Jaison? -Do you know what happened? Asking unnecessary questions to irritate me! Why are you angry with me? As if I brought the lightning down to you! Yeah, as if I am the one who brought it on me! Who are you? A doctor? Step aside! I am his father! That's exactly why I am asking you to step aside! -Are you done with the injection? -Yes. Switch it on! Doctor, why is it shaking? How would I know? Maybe this is how it works! Dad, please take me to a good hospital! This is a good hospital. It's just the machine. Get out of my way! Shibu! Get up. Shibu! It's an earthquake! Run for your life! Run! Get up! Run! Don't stop! Keep running! Where is the earthquake? What is wrong with you, old hag? Eat, dog. Is he not dead? -Stop it! -Such a loving brother-in-law! How was the lightning experience, uncle? It was wonderful darling. I had a good time! I've told everyone! Good to know that you're also trying your bit! -You! -What is it? Didn't I tell you to prepare my food before you left for the hospital? Did you die of hunger? -What? -I mean, I had already cooked. Then set it on the table! -This is so irritating! -Are you not going to school? "Aneesh weds Bincy." What is emotion? Chemical changes in the nervous system are reflected as emotions. What are emotional tears? When the mind is turbulent with intense emotions, the human body produces these tears. These contain 24% more protein than normal tears. What are emotional tears? When the mind is turbulent with intense emotions the human body produces these tears. I will show you! These contain 24% more protein… What are emotional tears? What happened? Were you crying? Who cried? -Josemon, go home. -Yes? And, Jaison, you come over here! Come here. Pothan shouldn't know, at any cost! If he does, he will kill me! At least this time, try to succeed in your life! I will! God only knows! But why did you say that? I mean, like last time. Lending me some gold doesn't mean that you can lecture me! Okay? I will return this! Who will give? It is not easy to get a job in America. What is the use of all this fashion nonsense! And then there are some who are trying to. Spare me and keep your ugly business with your customers! Oh, that must have hurt. Jaison. What about the money, I had asked? The doctor says we shouldn't delay Kukkumol's operation. What can I do? I wish I could help! But I am helpless! There won't be any class today. She will beat him black and blue. That 'Bruce Lee' kick is quite something! Is 'Bruce Lee' in? Yes. But it's better if you don't go! Why is that? Her ex-lover has come to invite the teacher to his wedding! Aneesh? Yeah! -Will there be that "kick"? -Of course, yes! What else do you think these people have gathered here for? It's about time! Oh, my god! Why did you kick me? You didn't agree with my decision to end your karate classes after marriage! Else, I would have only married you! Such a glorious man to get married to! Who would want to get married to you? You nincompoop! I haven't even considered you, as a man! If you don't return my money you are going to pay for it, dearly! I will not spare you for this! -My friend, come to my wedding. -Take these. -Bruce Lee. -What do you want? Sorry Biji, that cash is ready. You will pay for this! Wait and watch! -Karate thickhead! -You! Leave it, Biji! He is a scoundrel! What the hell happened to you? Cough. The cash is ready. -Jaison, do you need some water? -No, it's fine. Yesterday a guy was here for verification. It went fine. Once the passport comes through you can leave for America in three months. And then that police verification will also be over by this week. Until then, keep that money with you. Are you even listening to me? What are you doing there? Jaison. Jaison! Uncle! -Uncle. -Yes? Uncle, we should tell grandpa, right? Why don't we wait until morning? It will cost him a lot to repair, right? Maybe. I think the bathroom tap is running. I don't hear anything. But I can! What? I didn't do anything. Something is wrong! -Someone, help! -For what? My uncle has gone mad! Let's wait over there. or let's get in over here. Sasi! -Yes. -Isn't that Daasan's sister? Usha. Yes, it's her! When did she come back? Gone are the days, when she was a pretty little lass. Now she has matured rather well. This is when they are at their best. Call them over. Daasan! Don't get drenched in the rain, come over! And you can have tea too! -Shibu! -Yes? Prepare two cups of tea! Make it a bit sweeter! Where did you go, Daasan? Had to take the little one to the doctor. -Doctor. -Yes. This is the blood result of the electrocuted guy. Can you review it? What? Oh, my god! What happened to your uncle? This has been going on for the last two days. -What happened? -Is there anything to eat? Appam and beef curry. Do you want some? What is this? Only three appams? Jaison had the rest! You gave away my appams to Jaison? So? -Dad! Jaison! -Stop right there! -Shut your mouth. -It's only appam and not gold! -I can make more. -Then you give them the gold too! Pothan! Pothan, stop it! -Dad! -You let it be. I'll handle it. -I will teach you a lesson today. -Dad, leave her alone! -Pothan, leave her! -Get lost! -Oh, God! Father! -Father! -I won't spare you! -Leave me! Pothan, don't you dare touch my sister! And what will you do? If you lay your hands on her one more time, I will not spare you! Now what? What would you do? I dare you to touch a policeman, in uniform! I really want to see that! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me, you dog! Jesus Christ! Brother! My dear! Brother, that was a slight miscalculation! -Get lost! -Sorry. Don't take it hard! -Where is my girl? -I also want to see! I want to see my girl. Don't touch me! Stop doing that! Jaison, go get some soup from the canteen. -Brother, I will get some soup soon. -Whatever. -You! Come here. -What is it? Is he trained in martial arts? Tell me the truth. The men in our family are all skilled fighters! They don't need to take any lessons for that! I will see to it that, he is behind bars one of these days! -Dad, is this a flag? -What? Get this menacing brat out of my sight! Energy! I'm sure you are all familiar with thunder and lightning. Do you know what it is? It's a process by which enormous energy is generated! When lightning and thunder strikes it is dangerous for people to venture outside. Do you know why? Oh, someone is early today! Take your seat. So we were discussing how. Josemon, your uncle is a badass! -Why? -He hit your dad and put him in the well! You are Jaison, right? Yes. After that incident with the lightning, did you feel anything strange? I just had a bout of cough. -No other problems. -I am just enquiring. When I checked the blood results, there were some variations. It was a cough, wasn't it? -Yes. -I knew it! Carry on, carry on. When lightning strikes a person, a thousand joules of energy enter the human body! But the human body cannot contain that kind of energy. That's why people die when lightning strikes them! Teacher, what happens if someone doesn't die? Uncle, have you heard about Miller Urey? Who the hell is he? He was a scientist. His theory is that life took form on this planet, from lightning! There are lightning survivors, who can read minds and who regularly win the lottery. I think all your changes are caused by that lightning strike! There is no other explanation! These changes you have, it's called superpowers! What the heck is this? -Superpowers? -Yes! There are different kinds of powers. For some, it's heightened intelligence, for others, it's heightened strength, and lastly, it's heightened memory, like that! And for some others, it's heightened memory and so on… Have you heard about Spiderman, Batman, and Superman? Not really! Who are those fellows? To know them, you need some brains, to start with! You should read Amar Chithra Katha and other comics! These guys are superheroes! This means, guys with lots of powers! Spiderman got it from a spider bite! I am not so sure about Batman. Maybe, while playing cricket someone would have whacked his head with a bat! That could be the only possibility! Where are these guys now? Uncle, they are all Americans! America is surviving only because of them! Really? -They are all in America? -Yeah! -I will see them there! -Now, it's just not the Americans. We also have our own superhero to save our country! Who is that? It is you, Uncle! No way! I don't want to be stuck here. I will go to America and survive doing some superhero antics. Uncle, please don't say that! Then who would be there for us? Fine! Forget all that. Tell me, what are your superpowers? Is the tossed-away rusted coin Attaining a new shine? A snap of the finger Sounds like a cracker! Seeing the magic They are dumbfounded! We are all astounded Without magic and illusions Like stepping onto a wonderland Jaison! -What's going on here? -Nothing! -Where are my utensils? -It's all in here! Have you gone nuts after that lightning strike? Return my utensils! Seeing the magic, they are dumbfounded! Oh, God, protect me from airplanes. One… Two, three… -Uncle! -What? -Don't jump! -Get lost! I don't think I can fly! Let's stick to what we can do! Come, let's go. This man! This man! Uncle, I want Cuticura! -Cuticura? -Yes. This man! You always complain that I don't get you anything? Tell me, what do you want? Steam cooker. Steam cooker? Here it goes! This man! -Jaison! How did you do that? -This man! This man! You are all very supportive! I like it! This man! Without magic and illusions Like stepping onto the wonderland Glancing at the moon, the two Are musing about selling it in the bazaar Bincy, look here. Let him go to hell! Are you crazy, still thinking about him? You should get inspired by me! I got fooled by Bincy more than Aneesh ever fooled you! -And still, I didn't cry! -Uncle! You should have the willpower to face anything. Be strong! This is for you. You should take care of your beauty. Have the biscuit, you look tired. Desire has descended in honey And a million dreams have risen Love has erected a fort And the longing keeps him alive Desire has descended in honey And a million dreams have risen Love has erected a fort And the longing, keeps him alive The magic show is about to begin. You are all welcome to witness. -Magic Show! Forget Cuticura. -Uncle, my Cuticura? Forget Cuticura These valiant ones When they meet face to face Who will fiercely reign in the realm? That's a lot. Let me know when it's time for an X-ray. Without magic and illusions Like stepping onto the wonderland Uncle, try with more power! More power! More! Leave it, Uncle. We don't have that power! Let's go then. We will try to burst more balloons or win some bangles. Well, god doesn't bless one with all the talents right. HOTEL THUSHAR -Take the money. -Okay. How are you doing, Usha? Daasan mentioned your daughter's illness. You must be tired, managing all of this all alone. Don't hesitate to tell me if you need anything. I understand your situation. It's good that you left Satheesh! Not just in Podimattam, it seems, he has wives in many other places too! Usha, try to drop by when you can. We can spend some time catching up. I am all alone here. Let's go. Do you want to pass? Try! You're no longer the same girl! You are more beautiful now! -Would you like to come home? -Move aside! As if she is an angel! Shibu! Shibu! What is it? Shibu, bring me down! What has happened to you? Shibu! Please, put me down. You should not have spoken to Usha like that! You're right! I should not have! -I am letting you go today. -Okay. But if you ever repeat this, -I'll frame you in a picture on the wall! -My goodness! Your funeral will be at my expense! That won't be necessary. Shibu. Don't speak about this, to the police or to anyone for that matter! I am too big for the jails here! Imbecile! Let's get it done. Aneesh and his gadgets. -I'm seeing this for the first time! -Me too! Aneesh is a smart guy! -Praise the Lord! -Do the sweets taste good? Be careful. Go on, take one. Did you have some? Biji, do you want some ladoo? Get lost! I guess you don't! I just received this letter. You need to see it. Even though I often scolded him, he really wanted this. Biji! Biji, the postman said my passport verification didn't go through! What happened? I don't know what happened. Our application was proper! Recently, didn't you have an issue with your brother-in-law? Yes. Perhaps he would have scuttled it? That can't be. What happened in the past was because of my immaturity. It didn't occur to me that he was cheating! I suffered a lot! I don't want another marriage. You should understand me. Kesavan is aware of our situation. He likes you. That's why he asked me. If you agree, all of our issues will be resolved. -Mom! -What do you want? Spare the child from your anger towards me. I understand. Our father fell ill the day you left us. He never recovered. I borrowed a lot of money for his treatment. Kesavan was the only one to help me. That is why I am a bit reluctant to refuse him! It's all right. You don't have to barter your life for my debts. Kesavan. Yes. She is not feeling well. I guess it's a headache. Can we do it another day? What? I guess the headache is over, isn't it? Yes, it's over! Usha. Hi. I just dropped by to give you this. You left it in the shop yesterday. Do you remember me? I'm Shibu. You left Satheesh, haven't you? Usha, will you go back again? Can you at least, leave me alone? What have I done wrong to you all? Ayyo! My baby! -Dear! -My baby? - My baby! -What happened? -Oh, God! My baby! -Dear! My baby? Will it work? It's a bit complicated, sir! Sir! -Can you let me out for a day? -What for? Movie actor Sudheesh is coming in the evening. I want to see him! Shut up! Aren't you the one who stole Fatima's goat? You are not going anywhere! Idiot, testing my patience. What is the issue, Jaison? -My passport verification. -You failed, didn't you? That's really unfortunate! Sir, if it's because I hit my brother-in-law, -I am willing to apologize to him. -Who told you? At the end of the day, Pothan is family! Why would he do that? Would you do that, Pothan? Never! The guys who came for verification approved it. but I intervened to fail you. I wouldn't let that credit go to your brother-in-law! Please don't pick on me because of our personal grudges. All that happened that day because I was drunk. How many fathers do you have? Sir, you should watch your words! Oh, so you can speak! This is as decent as I can be! Jaison, how come your father's name is different in different certificates? Why is it so? It isn't so for us. On your birth certificate, your father's name is Martin, and on your high school certificate, it's Varkey! So when there is a disparity in the documents, how will we verify your application? Tell me. There must have been an error in the birth certificate. -They said it was not an issue. -Oh, really? Poor fellow! So you don't know the story behind this! Why didn't you tell him all these years, Varkey? Varkey knows the truth. Varkey, you should say it now! If you don't, I will! You tramp! He is not your father! He was a theatre artist. Some Martin! He had gone to perform at a church festival where the firecracker warehouse exploded and he died in that fire. You lost your memory too. From that day on, this useless old man has fooled you by pretending to be your father. This is not your house, town, or family. You are an outsider! Isn't that the truth, Varkey? Isn't that the truth, Varkey? Dad? You bastard. What did you say to my daughter that day, that you will go abroad and get rich? Listen, Jaison! Even if you can't go abroad, there is so much work here. You can clean the drains, wash the toilets and even bury the dead! So many jobs like that! As long as I am here, you are not going anywhere! I won't let you become anything! How dare you play with the police force? Rascal! -What? -What nasty thing have you done? Varkey! Usha, I told you last time not to delay her operation. It has to happen today. Once the payment is done, we will start the procedure. Usha, don't play with your child's life! Doctor, you start the procedure, and I will bring the money. Who is he? I am someone important to her. Don't worry. Where is Jaison? He is in his room. Son! I wanted to give you this a long time ago. But I didn't. Perhaps, I was selfish. I thought, if you knew the truth, you wouldn't call me "Dad." This trunk belongs to your father. This is his only belonging that I have. THE SAINT OF PALLIKUNNU One more thing. Your father did not just die in an explosion. Like many others, that night, he could have escaped the fire. But he didn't. The many he rescued that night, are still alive, even today. My child… Your father was a hero. MINNAL MURALI Dad, who is Minnal Murali? That's the title of my latest play. What does he do? Dad! What happened to you? Why don't you tell me? You just calm down. Let's go to the hospital. Mom, just leave him alone! Did you see this? Did he hit you? Who? Who did this to you? Why don't you just keep quiet? Will you please tell me who did this to you? Why can't you just say that? -Come here. -Get up! Let's go to the hospital. Those Americans you were talking about? Yeah, superheroes! What is their game plan? They will wear a mask, a cape around their shoulders, and beat up the bad guys! For the Kurukkanmoola school anniversary, to enhance the celebrations, having acted in films like Anantharam, Cheppadividya, and Manichithrathazhu, he has become our pride and a youth icon, Mr. Sudheesh! In a few moments, will reach the Kurukkanmoola school grounds. You are all invited to join the celebration! Please come. "Kindi! Kindi!" Stop it! It's okay! Give me a hand… "Kindi! Kindi!" You think you're too smart, don't you? Behave yourselves! Don't worry. I will get it done. Sudheesh had refused to come. But I insisted! Can you please move out of my way? Why can't you move? You should! Ravan, don't mess things up! Mind your business, Ram! I will take your heads off one by one! I can't find my costume! What? Play the song! -Any new movies you're in? -Look over there. KURUKKANMOOLA SCHOOL ANNIVERSARY Now, who the hell is that? Maybe a student with a lot of arrears! A blazing lightning gleamed Wonderful performance! Don't you think so? A raging tempest and rain clouds Rolled over To protect the lands The valiant-one has descended In plain sight, he flew Alongside the crows and its fledglings Thronged together, they hearken to Dishoom, dishoom! Oh, God! Excuse me. Move aside! I'm the actor Sudheesh! You should ensure my safety! What the heck is happening? In the enchanted woods, a long time ago Entered a menacing beast Helpless creatures burnt As the gun roared! Get him! Take him down! -Gandhi, don't! -Oh, sorry. On the branch of a banyan tree He was hung, like a swing The jolted and quivered earth Spinning in its wings -Excuse me. -Yeah. In the dark, fireflies twinkled! Excitement buzzed and brimmed And the fire was felt in the bones The imperious lord, was thus banished! Move aside, brother. Move aside, brother. -I want to watch it. -Dad, I want to watch the fight. Irresponsible idiots! Where will I go now? Welcome to Actor Sudheesh, my foot! Which moron built this wall here? Shame, shame, puppy shame. Saajan, have you heard of the death knell? No. I will be watching you, every moment! I will be aware, of every move you make, every breath you take! If you ever lay your hands on anyone, you will hear your death knell! If you have the balls, reveal your identity. MINNAL MURALI Isn't this Kuku's operation bill? This bill is already cleared! He is the one who cleared it! -Daasan! -Yes. Nothing will happen to your daughter. Everything will be fine. Why was he here? What did he say? He didn't say anything. That's how my leg got stuck, inside the pot. Now, it looks like there is a slight bend. It's not much of an effort to walk… The masked man, who addresses himself as Minnal Murali, assaulted the police on the day of Kurukkanmoola School anniversary, and then pulled off a heist at the Kurukkanmoola cooperative bank, is on the loose. Any information about his whereabouts should be reported to the police station without any delay! Signed by the sub-inspector of the Kurukkanmoola Police Station. What the hell is happening? Yeah! Our police are not efficient in hunting him down! It's been two weeks, and they don't even have a clue! How will they catch him? Isn't he superhuman? I heard he is around seven and a half feet tall! He smashed the shit out of Pothan! A quarter kilo of gold and 150,000 rupees was looted from the bank! How effortlessly he cracked the bank locker. Whatever the case, the name he goes by is simply splendid! Minnal Murali. Move aside, brother. Mo… Mo… Move aside, brother… As he punched me, he said something like, "Marala…" "Marala?" "Marra Laha!" What? Pothan, I am sure he is a terrorist! We have to be alert! Now he'll start doubting everything. We won't be able to contain this! CBI from the center needs to step in! Bullshit. This is some local. He wrote "Minnal Murali" in Malayalam. Doesn't it make sense? We will find some evidence, I'm sure. It's not finished. -I will finish him. -Not him. The buttons. Oh, it's missing. What time is the wedding? -Is there anyone here? -No. A button is missing. I have to wear this for the wedding. Can you fix it? I will pay for it. -Come in. -I don't need your favors. Where are you going? To the wedding. Uncle, can you drop me at the junction? The wedding bus has a stopover there. Let me change. There is no time to change. Let's go, Uncle. Father, I will be back soon. Tell me the truth. Are you planning to sneak into your ex-lover's wedding? Tell me… Move aside, brother. "Move aside, brother." So you're not going to your ex's wedding? You don't feel like going? Tell me and then you can leave. Move aside, brother. "Move aside, brother." Why can't you go with your father? I am not amused, in the company of police. Are you coming to the wedding? They are serving biryani. My dog will attend her wedding. I don't intend to eat her free biryani. Whatever. Another thing, just be a little careful. After being punched that day, dad is determined to find Minnal Murali. Don't worry, your dad is not that smart. That's wishful thinking! I suspect his morning visit to your house was his ploy. Dad, look here! Dad, would you please look over here! Dad! Look here! Dad! Why don't you look at me? Did you hide the mask, in some safe place? If he finds it, then you are done! And then even I won't be able to help you! Why are you scaring me now? Go ahead, I will join you later! Uncle! Dad, is this good? Is it good? -Tell me…. -Move aside! I found you. Minnal Murali! Was that a tsunami? -Hello! -Hi. Where is brother-in-law? No idea. He was yelling, "I found it," and grabbed the dhothi from the washing line and drove off. He said he will be back soon! Oh, it was just these pomelos. You little prick, Minnal Murali! Today, I will put an end to your games! You said only your dog would attend the wedding! Oh, no! Oh, you couldn't resist the taste of biryani. I jumped in by mistake. I'm leaving! -Jaison! -Oh, Bruce Lee! What are you doing here? This is Aneesh's wedding bus! I decided to go, but I didn't think you would come too! What are you wearing? You are wearing a lungi to the wedding? You look like a begger. I'm not attending the wedding. I got in by mistake! -I'm going. -Jaison, don't leave! If we don't go to the wedding, they will think we are still heartbroken! We shouldn't give them that impression. -Take a seat. -Move to this side. What you're wearing is more than enough! How is your neck? Is it painful? How is your neck pain now? It's probably going to last forever! But he doesn't know me well enough! I will show him, one day! Shall I tell her? Why would we hold on to grudges? Leave it! A collar suits you well. My brother-in-law looked so bad with it! You liar! Sir Thomas! I dare you to take a picture of this! Please come! -Enjoy the feast. -Bincy, did you recognize me? -You are a member of the choir, right? -Yes, you are right. Please enjoy the feast. Like an adorable star And a soothing breeze Someone has come to my life Your starry eyes And your sweet whispers May no longer be a secret Let's take a picture. You are looking good in the jubbah but if you don't catch Minnal Murali soon, you won't have a job! Just ignore her. -All the best! -Thank you. Congratulations! I don't shake hands with girls. You should know, Bincy. But Jaison can. How come you are in a lungi? Congratulations! -What happened? -That was an excellent decision! Get lost! Hold this! All the very best! My sweet boy! My sweet sweet boy! -Move aside! -Don't push! I said, move aside! There are no available seats! Move! -Why did you push them? -I didn't. Let's go in. Move away, you idiot! We are here to dine and not to rob! I'm a police officer! I've found my comfort in you We can now embark on a long journey Your presense consoled My grieving heart and weeping eyes The sorrowful time has passed away -The food was good. Isn't it? -Yes. Why is Usha talking to such people? I clearly don't appreciate that! Jaison! -Take it slow! You will break it! -No way! Jaison! -You have the money, right? -Yes, I have it! Let's meet the panchayat members in the evening. He promised to help with the passport! I will see you there with the cash! -All right then! -Okay! Where is he getting all this money from? I'm sure he's the one who robbed the bank! -What is it, sir? -Nothing. -Father. -Yes? Have you seen the money I kept in the drawer? Who keeps money in the shop? Father! Daasan. While you were searching for Ashok's missing pant piece, did you happen to see the money? Daasan, did you take it? Jaison! Where is my money? Sir, these are my findings of who Minnal Murali could be. Oh, this is quite the research! Just 238 pages! Isn't that a stretch? I have an empty stomach. Keep it brief. Sir, I have something to share! He just started. Let him finish! Continue. Sir! One Surendran is here to collect money for the wedding tent! -Tell him, I will break his legs! -I will tell him. -Tell him exactly, as I told you! -Sure, sir! -Sir! -Wait! What happened that night was a terrorist attack! Even though you got beaten up, his target was someone else! -You mean actor Sudheesh? -No, sir. -Principal Mathan? -No, sir. Senator K.C. Gopalan. My good lord! There could be another attack on him at any moment! We have to provide additional protection for the MLA. Perhaps he looted the bank to fund his next attack. Not only that, he kept saying "Marra Laha" while attacking Pothan! -That's another clue! -What clue? Sir, Marra Laha is a place on the outskirts of Iraq! Which means? So this terrorist is from Iraq? -Yes! -Oh, my god! -You are brilliant! I'm proud of you! -Thank you, sir. Believe me, sir, it's not, "Marra Laha." It's "Move aside, brother!" "Move aside, brother." And it's not a terrorist attack! Jaison is behind all this! The attack on you was his revenge for declining his passport verification He is the one who looted the bank too! Pothan, you are consistently proving that you are a dimwit! The way he jumped around and attacked us proves that he is an internationally trained criminal! Do you really think Jaison is capable of doing all this? Don't try to drag your petty rivalries into this case! Attacking me was a ploy to mislead us! Tell me, two days ago, you were convinced that it was, "Marala." How did it change so quickly to "Move aside, brother"? You have to trust me! -Do you have any proof? -I do! The dhothi he wore! I was bringing it over here when he-- What happened then? He… Just because he possesses two dhothis, will he become Minnal Murali? I have three dhothis at home, will that make me Minnal Murali? Sir. -There is a fight in the market. -Who is fighting? Jaison and Daasan! Jaison, don't create an unnecessary issue. -Don't try to stop me! -Let's discuss it sanely. Did you think you could fool me? I didn't have a choice. That was the only way before me, to pay for Usha's child's operation. Would you rob someone for that? My intention was to replace it soon, but I couldn't! If you don't return my money before evening, I will finish you! Jaison, watch your words! Get lost! Why did you do such a thing? Let's go! I would have helped you! You have to stop wearing this, around here. Start wearing proper clothes! I've decided to bring Usha home. Would Daasan approve it? Who do you think you are, to assault Daasan? Don't assume you are big enough for that! Then what should I do with him for stealing my money? I ought to have congratulated him? I want my money back! My money, my life, me, me! You are so selfish! Do you really care for anyone? I don't have to! Are any of them concerned about my wellbeing? No! As if that's a reason. Hey! You forget about the people. Daasan is not like them! You should not have laid your hands on him! You were like a son to him. He is going through a lot of crises. He is struggling hard to make ends meet. We have only one life! Try your best not to err. You should strive to take the higher moral ground. It's not always about you. Your father was like that. You should also be like that. If you can, do apologize to him. What do you want? I need to speak to you. About? I will tell you. I know you're going through a difficult phase. Keep this money! You can return the money you owe to Jaison. What do you really want? Daasan, will you give your consent to marry Usha? That won't happen, Shibu! Better if you don't harbor such intentions! What is your worth, to marry her? Is it your madness? Or the madness that runs in your family, that killed your mother? You better get going. Can I speak to Daasan? He is not back from the shop. All right. Is there anything you want me to tell him? Not really, but I will drop by on my way back. -What now? -I want to speak to you, Daasan! Can you please leave me alone! I am about to leave. You are not going anywhere, Daasan! You also have a mother right? Wouldn't you get hurt if someone called her crazy? It hurts for me as well. When my mother died, my father buried her, and absconded, leaving me all alone! I had nothing to eat for days! No one came looking for me… They would have thought that lunatic Paru's child would die of hunger. Usha was the only one who was there for me and fed me. The mercy Usha showed me, no one ever offered me again! From that day onwards, she was my life! I'm sure you know it! I know she loves me, she loves me a lot. But she will only listen to you! and you would never agree to that! The way I love her, no one can ever love her! Why don't you get that, Daasan? You had asked, what is my worth to marry her right? It's my love for her. That is my worth. At least now, I want to have a life with her, Daasan. For that, you should be gone. Forgive me, Daasan There is no other way! Someone, please help. The shop is on fire. Someone, please help. The shop is on fire. Everyone! Hurry up and come! The shop is on fire! Everyone, come soon! The shop is on fire! My goodness! The shop is on fire! Help! The shop is on fire! Hurry up. Fetch the water! The shop is on fire! Don't waste time. Douse the fire! Pour the water. More water. Don't waste time. Oh, lord! Get more water! Quickly. We need more water! Carefully. Oh, God! Daasan! There isn't space for everyone. Only a few of us need to go. Make it quick! The shop is fully gutted! Absolutely nothing is left! Don't go inside! Come back. Come back. MINNAL MURALI Where are you going, Pilee? I'm leaving! This village is going to be destroyed! If you want to be alive, leave now! Just go somewhere! Save your lives! This village, it's going to be destroyed! MINNAL MURALI I'm totally confused now. Every tom, dick, and harry says it's Jaison! Is he stupid enough to burn down his own shop? Even if he was enraged, why would he kill him, here? Wouldn't he know, he would be the suspect? From a criminal psychology point of view, over-smart criminals would do it! -Did you get confused? -Yes! That's exactly what he also wants! Sir, let's not act on it in haste! Let's get some conclusive evidence! What? Some "conclusive evidence." It's gun powder. Let's also not discard the terrorist angle I mentioned earlier. My intuitions are seldom wrong. Biji, I have to tell you something! I am Minnal Murali. What did you say? The masked guy, who pretends to be Minnal Murali, is me! Yeah, as if I'm going to believe you! Don't do it! -As the police claim, did you kill Daasan? -No! Did you loot the bank? That's not me, Biji! I'm not capable, of all that! So who punched me on the anniversary day? Biji, no! BIJI MOL TRAVEL AGENCY AND MARTIAL ARTS ACADEMY I'm not worried about the police, but… Daasan's face haunts me. I couldn't even get to ask for forgiveness. There is no point fretting over the past! You will be responsible for everything that is done in the name of, Minnal Murali! Now we need to think about what needs to be done! What's your plan? I have to find the imposter, behind all this, and framing me for his mess! I will not let him run free. That's the least I owe Daasan. You get started. We only need one Minnal Murali in Kurukkanmoola. -I am with you. -Exactly! I am also with you, Uncle! If Minnal Murali is spotted anywhere in your surroundings, ring the alarm bell or inform the police station immediately. It doesn't have to be Minnal Murali! If anyone goes by the name Murali, inform us! My fellowmen, who is this Minnal Murali? He is scuttling the peace of this village? Minnal Murali will be arrested now! Come to the police station if you want to see! Don't leave! Please don't leave! Whether Minnal Murali is caught or not, we will continue with this protest. MINNAL MURALI SHOULD BE ARRESTED IMMEDIATELY Don't make noise. We'll find out soon who the person is. To be honest, it didn't occur to me about the CCTV. From the day of the shop's inauguration, everything in this area is recorded! Really? Let me know any time if you need my help. Here we go… A bit dark, though! -Oh, no! -Oh, no! What impeccable timing! What's the commotion there? Go check it out! Who is that? POLICE STATION KURUKKANMOOLA Who the hell is that? Get the gun! Get me the gun! Move! Do you think I won't recognize you Jaison if you wear that stupid mask? Jaison! Jaison. Sir Saajan! -Who the hell are you? -It's me! -Fire! -Sir! Please don't! How should I aim? Without shivering! Sir, don't embarrass us. Who are you? Get out! Get out of here, you rascal! Get away from here. I just got married. My wife is beautiful. Please don't hurt me! I didn't do anything… Sir, you can do whatever you want. Take it! Being an aggressive young leader of this state, I'm very… What is this? God will come! God will come! So soon? You! Oh, God! Give it to me! Mother! -Mother! -My baby… My baby! Can someone save my daughter? Ayyo. My baby! -My baby! -Mother! SAVIOR MINNAL MURALI (ORIGINAL) Minnal Murali is my brother's friend. When he came home, he shook my hand. His hands were like rocks. So strong! Oh, you are so lucky! MINNAL MURALI 1 MINNAL MURALI 2 MINNAL MURALI IS THE LUCKY MASCOT OF THIS BUS MUSCLE MAN CEMENTS Hey! This is for you! Take it… Why don't you come with me, Usha? I promise to take good care of you! Didn't I wait for you all these years? What are you doing here? Don't try to stick around here. Leave! Usha, you can't trust these guys! I will have some tea. MINNAL MURALI (ORIGINAL) How will we find it here? It might no longer be here! If you don't shut up, you will get to know my kick! Oh, sorry! I had to call you over as she was repeatedly using bad words. Sir, you didn't say anything? -Do you have the photos taken by him? -No! We didn't take it! He wanted to charge us for the photographs! Where is he now? A mechanic from Pallikunnu checked it. Oh, okay! But he couldn't fix it. How did this happen? I'm also not sure how it happened! I used it on a guy, who was struck by lightning… All of a sudden, the machine spewed fire and then smoke! -Smoke? -Yes. And then what happened to the guy? Nothing happened to him. He is perfectly all right. I'm anxious to know, what happened to this machine? It's simple. This can be fixed by anyone who knows how to. -So you can't? -No way. -What are you doing here then? -I'm learning… Got it! Shi… Shijil. -Do you have a fever? -Yes. I will give you a token and you can meet Dr. Sambhashivan. My God! -Starting with "Shi" Shinoj? -No! -Shinto? -No! Aneesh? We are not looking for "esh" but "shi"! Shibu! JAISON -Did you get it? -Yes, sir! But I'm not sure if it's recognizable enough. This is enough for me. -Have you seen Pothan? -No, sir! I'm restless until I give him a mouthful! Sir! Where did you disappear to? One tea, please! Any information on the whereabouts of Minnal Murali? Nothing so far. He can't be let loose for long! We have to get hold of him! Of course, we have to! He won't be out there for long! Maybe. He might be in our midst! One day, he will fall into our hands. Okay, I will call. Okay, yeah sure! -Hey! -Yes. Councilor! He is here. Minnal Murali! Come over here! There is something, I have to tell you. What incredible reflex was that? If not, you would have been in a coffin by now! Didn't you see he was having tea? He is here! Do one thing. -Get more people. -He shouldn't escape this time! This way… Walk along. Come. Walk along. Don't force yourself! So you are Minnal Murali. You are good! We can deal with this between us, why make it a spectacle? Let's end this here. I'm done! You have to forget everything. Should I forget Daasan's murder? I didn't know about your relationship with Daasan. He was a nuisance for me since childhood. I would not be able to marry Usha if he was around. So I had to get rid of him! What happens when Usha finds out about it, someday? That day, I will burn down this Kurukkanmoola! Shibu, we were both struck by the same lightning. Don't ever forget that. I don't want to hurt anyone. I assure you, I won't create any problems. Now I have a silver lining to live. It has never happened to me before. I hope you won't stand in between. I will leave this village the day Usha accepts me! Give me some time. Pick up that stone. And that too. Did you think you could have a blast forever as Minnal Murali? Son of a bitch! Bring him here! -Is he the one? -Yes, sir! You may leave now. It's me, who they want. Go get him! Stone him to the ground! Run! Did you really think that you could get away after assaulting policemen? From day one, I knew that it was you! You really did give me a hard time! I won't let you go until you pay for it, dearly! I will prove to you that I'm not a fool! Don't let him escape, at any cost! We have to stand together! Try not to go near him! He may be powerful, but we will catch him tonight! Otherwise, he will destroy this village! -We'll capture him for sure! -Kurukkanmoola doesn't need him! Even if we have to die, we will burn him down! When did you come? My love, without knowing you I never knew! I would have perhaps lived a lifetime Twenty-eight years! Like a blazing flame That's my twenty-eight years of longing! I have not discarded anything, it's all here! I didn't know how to confide in you. I will be with you, love! Will you be with me? My love, without knowing you I would, perhaps lived a lifetime! Like a blazing flame You are a desire, melting away! To tenderly caress my inner wounds I will be moonlight, I will be a shadow I will be with you, forever! I will be with you. Until the end of our times I will be with you, love! You are my dreams, my life! You are my paradise, my everything! You are my dreams, my life! You are my paradise, my everything! The clouds dwelling in the skies May fade afar To reach the oceans below They rain down, again I will fight the worlds, hereafter To win you, my love Here I am ending in you And let us together, flow as a river! Usha! This is Sub Inspector from Kurukkanmoola. Sir, a fire broke out due to burning firecrackers. This happened in Shibu's house. A woman named Usha and her daughter are reported to be dead. We have not been able to find Shibu. Over. This is fun. Have you tried it before? -Never. -Let's try. You will love it! Can I get the yellow ones too? Sir. You should arrest Shibu, as soon as possible. He gets really mad when he loses things he loves so dearly. Only once before has he gone absolutely mad. The day a bull killed his only friend. Do you know what he did then? He burned the bull alive. He was only seven years old, then! He is no longer a seven-year-old. Now he is capable of destruction far worse than before. Did you see my uncle? -What? -Have you seen my uncle? Now he has lost, the most important person in his life! Can I have a balloon? Please! He will unleash his wrath on these people. If you fail to stop him now, you will no longer have a village to protect. Call the fire force. Quick! Don't panic! There's nothing to fear! Don't run. Nothing to fear! There's nothing to fear! -What will we do? -Don't worry, Bincy! Sir, why don't we call for additional force? I did call everyone! By the time they come, it will all be over! Jaison, come here! I have no clue what creature you are or which alien planet you are from and I don't know what powers you have! Our people are in danger. If you can do something, this is the time for it! -Sir! -Shut up! Enough of your investigations! It's not because we are not skilled, it's just because we can't do it! Shinoj! How long have I been telling you to fix this lock? What the hell are you guys doing here? How am I supposed to release someone from the cell? We can try using a spear… I told you, only he can do something! Dad, who is Minnal Murali? That's the title of my new play. What does he do? He is the savior of the people in distress. Is he God? No, he is not! But he will be there, where God cannot be! Can I become, Minnal Murali? For that, you have to grow up… and emblaze! When everything is lost, people around you should look up to you, with hope! That day, you will become Minnal Murali! The savior of this land! Superhero! MINNAL MURALI Uncle! I knew you would come. Shibu, don't do this! These are innocent people trapped here! Don't harm them! I can comprehend the depth of your loss! But… Only I know the value of my loss! Neither I nor you can do anything about it. Nobody offered me any chance, and now, I don't want to offer them any! No one will live, I will burn everyone, alive! Uncle! Weren't you the savior? Go save them! What if I fail, Dad? What if I fall short of saving the people around me? I have seen your destiny in your eyes. In your battles, you will face powerful adversaries, But you will not fail! The strength to fight them will come from within! Because you will be surrounded by people who want you to win. You have to win for them! You will win. We too have that power! What have you decided? I'm not going! I have some unfinished work here. See you later. The destiny my dad saw in my eyes… Now I know what it is. I'm the chosen one for this land, the one chosen to protect. I can see the hope they have when I'm around. This is not the end, but the beginning! Evil powers might emerge again they might threaten to destroy and annihilate, but if they come, I will be here to take them on. As the savior of my land. As their own Minnal Murali.
