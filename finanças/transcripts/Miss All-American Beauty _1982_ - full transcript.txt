[screams] Good morning, your highness. Good morning. Your runner-up's coming this May. Although you're quite hideous, you can't get rid of us. We'll haunt you till your dying day. You guys are asking for it. [screams] [inaudible] You're going to get some royal purple bruises. [interposing voices] Buzz, right now, look at you. Buzzy Butterfield, is that my good green dress you're wearing? Now you take that off immediately. Well, not in here. This is a house full of lunatics. George, would you please do something? Leave your mother's good things alone, Buzz. Go get on a simple house dress or something. I just throw up my hands. I mean, I think you're all lunatics. Look here, Sal. You're on every front page I could find. Local girl wins Texas pageant. Oh, Sal, your pageant trainer called this morning. And she's expecting you in Waco by noon tomorrow. What for? I don't know. She said to call. She's the sweetest little Rosebud that Texas ever knew. Her eyes are like diamonds. They sparkle like the moon. You can talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosalee. But the yellow rose of Texas is the only gal for me. [music playing] Michael. Don't laugh. My personal favorite was the one contestant whose whole talent was fly casting. And her pole wasn't all she was flicking around either, I can tell you. I must have missed her. I liked the packer. Remember her? Oh, and that one poor girl who thought that she could play the piano. Which one was she? Butterbelly. Sally Butterbelly or something like that. Oh. I'm going to miss you. Well, I've got a lot of work to do. So frankly, I'll be relieved to get rid of you for a few months. Not so simple. You have to call me every day and write me every day. Now, how come? You're the one who enters this contest and I'm the one who has to suffer because of it. What about me? Lord knows what this trainer will have me do. Maybe I'll have to bind my feet and dye my hair green. You're the one who kept insisting that you weren't going to win this thing. You were just going to place and get a scholarship. Well, you got your scholarship, and they got you for three months. You better not let this interfere with your music. I'm serious, Ali. I mean, I insist on you practicing at least two hours a day. Keep your fingernails short and don't let that trainer mess you up. You always let people tell you what to do too much. I won't. You will. I know you. You're always getting pulled off your own track. This is a very crucial point in your music studies. You tell that trainer that your piano teacher is an ex lumberjack with a very bad temper, and you've got to practice. Or else. OK. I will. I will. OK. Quit talking so much. Come here. Oh, no. I've just been instructed not to let other people tell me what to do. I know, but the guy who gives out the instructions is the one exception. So that's how it works. And if his authority is questioned, he just uses force. You prehistoric chauvinist. No, no, no. You gave up your right to throw around those feminist phrases. You get to play the beauty queen, I get to play my caveman. I love you, you know. Couldn't help it, mom. That overly ambitious little Turk from the home office kept trying to whip up the whole ballroom into a frenzy of sale, sale, sale. Don't give me the silent treatment, mama. They're late too. It worked out good. Oh, dear. I'm all dressed up just dying to entertain a family. I don't know from Adam. I had the lights off of my teeth out by 7:30 last night. As far as I'm concerned, a chimpanzee could have won that contest. Well, she's far from it, mama. She's perfect. She's wholesome. Not too much of a knockout. An honor student, not a trace of cellulite. Well, she got buckets to learn, but who cares? The only girl who even came close was Waxahachie's entry. The poor thing, her bathing suit kept riding up in her rear. That must be her. Well, she's a plucky little thing. Look at her lift that luggage. I hope I don't have the usual trouble with the mother. Well, I hope you're not bringing me one of those nervous tap dancers like last year's what's-her-name. Like tulip, my kitchen and now. She's a classical pianist. But I'll fix that. Well, that's them. Guess who gets to provide the refreshments. I'll be in to help you later, mama. Here are my Butterfields. Come on in. Miss Blaine, this is my husband, George. And of course you already know our Sally. Hon, the first time I laid eyes on you, I said to myself, Agatha, here before you is sublime pageant material if ever there was any. Oh. Yes, well, we've always thought that she was extra, extra special. I promise you both in two months time, she'll be so gorgeous you won't even recognize her. Oh, this is real. [music playing] Sally. Pageant rule number one. Talent is only as good as its packaging. You probably just can't relate to this highbrow stuff. The higher the brow, the lower the score, as the judges say. But I'm a classical pianist. What can I tell you, sugar? All I know is people around me were nodding off. They were? Now, this Joplin piece is just what the doctor ordered. Oh, it'll have everybody's feet tapping. Miss Blaine, this isn't me. I really want to play my Beethoven. Let me introduce you to Blaine's law, Sally. Now open your ears. If you want to get what you want, you have to give them what they want. Have I been heard? Yes. You can show your stuff and tug at their patriotic heart strings at the same time, and here's what you're going to do. Watch here. A sparkle, now let's see it. There's my winner. All right now. [music playing] Chin up. Where's that sparkle? What's so fascinating on the floor? I don't want to fall off this thing. This runway is your friend. I'll have you on it so much you'll feel funny on solid ground. Keep your lips loose, not that loose. People'll think you're ready for anything. The swivel is the enemy of the glide. You've got to glide through your space. Glide. Do you see me laughing? No, ma'am. Beauty is achieved, not received. You're headed for some tough competition. You're a natural beauty, Sally. But it's my job to turn you into a winner. Now, the key to inner beauty is serenity. The key to outer beauty is inner beauty. Therefore my two magic words, as if. Act as if you are serene. [laughter] Up she goes. Oh, Hallelujah. What do you think, mama? We might just have ourselves a winner here. I'd vote for her in a hot minute. Mama, this pie is like a slice of heaven. Agatha's had me on insect food. Well, it's working because you're pretty as a postcard. Don't raise up your arm, you'll hike up the side. Where is that Michael? He said he'd be here at 3 o'clock. Well, you certainly don't sound like a girl who's got her mind set on winning the crown. Mama, I don't want to win this whole thing. I just want to be a finalist or something. You know that. I think we better get something straight here. Do you have any idea what it could mean to you if you win this contest? I mean, you would get to do things that people only read about in magazines. Mama, I have my plans. I mean, I still have to get my degree and-- well, Michael. Well, now you know that I think that Michael just hung the moon. But if you're going to let your feelings for him jeopardize your chances of winning this contest, then you're going to regret it for the rest of your life. Mama, he's the man I love. Now you listen to me. You are one of the prettiest and smartest girls in the best city in Texas, and you deserve to have your pick of men. And you deserve to travel, and to have first. Chances like this just aren't deposited on doorsteps. Trust me please. How are y'all doing, ladies? Oh. Hi there, Michael. How are you, Queen Mother? Watch out. I'm covered in pins. Well, my dear. Thorns make a rose more interesting. Excuse us, miss Butterfield. But all I've had my hands on for the last three months has been piano keys. Michael. Your daughter seems to have grown a tad, don't you think? Now you just behave yourself, y'all. I'm going inside to fix these puff sleeves. I'll be back to my sloppy old self real soon. Don't worry. Was I complaining? You look great. Wait. What are you going to do? Shower me in diamonds? That's next week. Just turn this way, your celestialness. I want to get a picture of us together. Oh, my rose. Oh. Wait a minute. OK, quick, kiss me. So it'll look like we're in love. Quick. [interposing voices] Could you believe that orientation? Especially the part about not getting to be alone with a man, not even your father. Thank the Lord my boyfriend Ernie didn't come. He'd probably dress up like a chaperone or something crazy and get me in trouble. I love the part where she kept saying, our swimsuit division is not vulgar. It's strictly to reveal our girls' hygiene. They want to check hygiene, they ought to see how many cavities each girl has. I guess we'll just have to grin and bear it. Bare it is right. Oh, watch out for that one. Her bra strap was hanging out at breakfast when one of the judges walked by. So I leaned over to tuck it in for her. The child nearly only bit my hand off. [applause] Thank you, ladies. Thank you very much. Good morning. Well, now that you've all registered, it gives me immeasurable pleasure and pride to welcome you on this glorious July morning. You are quite simply the most well-groomed, talented, and healthy young women our country has to offer. But let me remind you, we are not the Miss America pageant. We don't have a history to stand on. But what a challenge. As a young contest, we get to carve out tradition. The reporters that you see here-- how do you do? So nice to see you-- have been invited to the first press coverage of this exciting event. So please line up, will you, for the first official portrait? Line up right here. So by the way, what's your name? I'm Libby Beloit. Oh, I'm Sally Butterfield. Butterfield? Now there's a luscious name. Beloit must be the worst. My boyfriend Ernie? He says it sounds like a marble dropping into a toilet. Oh. Oh, she's not going to pull that old stunt. Come on. Oh, my God. [screams] Disgraceful. Stop. Sally, Felicity, no! [interposing voices] [music playing] Sally, you were wonderful. You were just wonderful. I could just faint. Oh, me too. I'm so nervous my knees are knocking. Maybe they'll think it's my tap shoes. Yeah. Oh, Sally. I've just got to get in the finals. I've got a whole cheering section out there. Cousins, aunts, neighbors. You name it, they're out there. [applause] Could you believe that, Felicity? I mean, you got to admit the girl can play the harp. Well, I remember her chaperone saying she's got the title wrapped up. Ladies, ladies. Quickly, hurry. Stage right immediately! [interposing voices] Hurry! Number six in our top eight finalists. From Illinois, Miss Felicity Winthrop. [applause] The next to last finalist, ladies and gentlemen, from Texas, Miss Sally Butterfield. [applause] And now, ladies and gentlemen, the judges' final choice. From New York, Miss Cynthia Veazy! [applause] There you are, ladies and gentlemen. The judges' favorites. Our next queen will be one of these eight lovely young ladies you see before you now. Felicity Winthrop is 22, a student at Northwestern University, majoring in television and film. Her hobby is raising Pekingese pups, in preparation for the world's oldest Java ball, motherhood. At 18 years old, Miss Sally Butterfield is our youngest contestant this year. She's an honor student in music at Leland University. Sally plans to pursue a career as a concert pianist. Her goal is to enter the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow. Cecelia Johnson is 21 years old, and a student at the University of Michigan. The daughter of an Air Force Colonel, Cecelia has been singing since before she could talk. Her dream is to perform at the Metropolitan Opera. Ladies, ladies. Make me proud of you. Please. Oh, cover those teeth with petroleum jelly. We don't want our lips hitched up in midair if our mouths go dry from nerves. Remember, there's not a loser among you. Good luck to you all. Break a leg. Those idiot judges could look right out of Fanny Overhang and not even recognize it. Lucky for you they can look right at False's and not recognize them. [interposing voices] Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Somebody put oil in your hairspray container. Oh. Oh, what kind of viper slithered in here would pull a stunt like this? Never mind. I'll fix this. Just pretend it didn't happen. That powder gave it even more body anyway. All right. Now just look judges straight in the eye and thank them. Thank them for being part of this glorious program. Oh, I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. [music playing] All right, ladies and gentlement. Our third runner up is from the state of Michigan, Miss Cecelia Johnson! [applause] And our second runner up, from the state of New Mexico, Miss Heather Green! [applause] Congratulations, Felicity. Thank you. And now, the moment that you've been waiting for. And I'd like to remind you that of course if for any reason our new queen can't fulfill her duties, her runner up will take over her title. Our first runner up, ladies and gentlemen, is from Illinois, Felicity Winthrop! Our new reigning queen is from right here in Texas, Miss Sally Butterfield! [applause] Oh, Sally! Oh, Sally! No more of this, Sally! No more of this! This is the real thing! The real thing! [screams] Dreamed the winning myself, Sally. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. I sure am going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, Libby. Sally. Sally, I need, I need-- excuse me. If you don't mind, Sally, I need you quickly. Sally, dear, I'd like you to meet our vice president of public relations, Mr. Avery MacPherson. Pleasure to meet you, sir. Congratulations. Thank you. Oh, honey. Mom. Oh, darling. Dad. Oh, mom. This is Mr. MacPherson. He's the president. My pleasure, sir. That isn't right? No. No, vice president of public relations. You look like a little angel. We couldn't stay to see you crowned, though, because the policemen dragged us out of our seats before it was over. Oh, I can't believe this is happening. I know. If you invest your daughter's earnings wisely this year, she'll end up with a secure financial future. Yes, sir. I just hope she's going to be happy. Sally! Sally! It paid off, didn't it? You showed them how to do it. Miss Blaine, you've done an exemplary job with Miss Butterfield. Well, she's a hard worker, sir. I'm glad to hear that. Oh. Oh, yes, I did. Certainly would have preferred the Winthrop girl. Could have gotten much more mileage out of her. Well, I tried to warn the judges to pick me a pro, but they're not the ones responsible for sales. Let's just hope she's as malleable as she seems. Mrs. Hunnicutt says you have to leave tonight. So we probably won't get a chance to talk again. She says you'd be getting a whole new wardrobe. And I just want you to know that mom and I'll get your stuff on home for you. And I'll notify the music department that you won't be back this year. Wow, everything's happening so fast. I hate to say goodbye like this. You call us the minute you ever need anything, or even if you don't need anything. We'll sure miss you. Time is up. They're holding up the press conference for you, Sally. There's no time to waste. I'm sure you understand, Mr. Butterfield. Hug the boys for me, dad. Take care of yourself. Here he is. Excuse me. Excuse me. Well, see you after the press conference, Mr. McPherson. In your office, right? In my office. Yes. Well, you're an accomplished pianist. I was very impressed. Thank you. That was just a popular piece they asked me to play. I'm really a classical pianist. Oh, I look forward to hearing your best. Have you ever met the press before? No. Not really. Do not let them pressure you into answering anything that you aren't sure of. All you need to say is that you have no opinion at this time. Now, what is your hobby? They always ask that. I do yoga. It's too un-American. Just say you do aerobics. Now if they ask you anything about abortion, gun control, smoking, drinking, drugs, premarital sex, the ERA, just say it's all right for others, but you yourself wouldn't. You're not engaged or anything, are you? No. Good. If they ask about that, just say you haven't met that special someone yet. OK. OK. Ready? Yes. Good. You know, Agatha, I've been wanting to have this little chat. Come in, dear, come right in. I've watched you now for, well, a number of years. And your girls are always impressive. Oh. Well, my mother's always saying I'm too old to do volunteer work. Never. Well, but you know how it is. Oh, once you catch them, the pageant favorite, you just can't get it out of your blood. I know. And Sally clearly responds well to you, Agatha. So it seems a natural choice for you to continue on as her chaperone during her reign. Well that is, of course, if you'd be interested. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Well, now that that's settled, here are your airline tickets. Where are we going? New York. Sally's makeover starts tomorrow. Hair, nails, wardrobe, et cetera. She does her first television interview on Friday. Here's your itinerary for the year, the rule booklet, credit cards, list of business representatives. Your limos and flight arrangements will be prearranged. Agatha, you will open all Sally's mail. Answer all phone calls. She must never answer the door, and of course, never consume liquor. Oh. But foremost, Agatha, there will be no male visitors alone at any time. You will be present continuously. I needn't elaborate on the scandals that have ensued for other pageants when this rule has been slighted. Am I making myself clear? Oh. Yes. Yes. Oh. Yes. Thank you. You must remember the press will always try to trap you. Never give them what they want. I know you sensed that that lady from the Gazette was trying to lure you-- Michael. When did you get here? Where have you been? The guard at the stage door wouldn't believe that I was your boyfriend. I told you that picture would come in handy. God, I can't tell you how good it is too see you. Can't we just have a few minutes alone together? It is against the rules. Please. All right. Five minutes. Five minutes. I'll meet you in Mrs. Hunnicutt's office. Michael. Nobody had a chance with you up there. You were resplendent. You were. I've never even said that word before. I just feel like this giant clock is going to strike midnight and everything's going to disappear. I'll turn from a handsome coachman back into a hound dog. You'll turn back into a pumpkin. What are you doing? You had to go and win, didn't you? I never dreamed it would turn out like this. So, what are you going to do? You're just going to give up your music? Michael, if I quit now, I'll lose everything, the scholarship. I'll be right back where I started. I don't have to lose my music. I can practice every day. Don't you have to travel like crazy? Well, I guess so. But I can practice on hotel pianos. Michael, we don't have to lose each other. We can write, we can make trips to see each other. I'll write you every day. We can make it work. Well, this half's sure going to be trying. Well, good, this half too. A photographer. No, no, no, no, no, no. Sir, I am terribly sorry. But we must reserve the public's right to view their queen as unattached. I'm sure you understand. This is totally unacceptable. Sally, you're now the queen, and I'm sure your little friend understands. Her little friend's name is Michael Carrington, and he understands that they've been promised a few minutes alone. Out of the question, Mr. Carrington. Her public is waiting for her upstairs at the pageant ball. You two can have your little talk up there. Come on, Sally. Sally. I love you more than words can say. Meet me in the broom closet at midnight. I wanted to let you catch a few extra winks for your 9:00 AM meeting with Mr. MacPherson. You've only been asleep three hours. Well, good morning, darling. Now, you listen to me. Never answer that phone. Miss Hunnicutt said it would be unbefitting to the title. Who are all these telegrams and flowers from? Admirers. Well, maybe not all admirers. Let me screen those. Agatha, we're in New York City, aren't we? Well, I assume it's still down there. So magnificent. Agatha, remind me I've got to send Michael a postcard from Lincoln Center. It's always been my dream to perform there someday. Oh, Agatha. What now? Pinch me so I'll know I'm not dreaming. Oh. It is unbefitting to the title for the queen to have bruises. Well, you could just hot roll it, that would make it look short on top. No, dear. Watch the hair twirling as well. You did that during your press conference. It really doesn't become you. And it reads dreadfully on camera. You have your first talk show tomorrow. So drop it. Oh. The eyes have got to go. We'll bring Francois in tomorrow. Oh, heavens, no. That's more like it. Yes, she's definitely the winter type. I like yellow. I've always felt good in yellow. Yes, dear. By the way, prints are not you. No hands on the face, Sally. Oh, I had no idea you had such short little nails. She'll have to wear fake ones. No. I have to keep my nails short for piano practice. Let me explain something to you, Sally. You now symbolize the ideal American woman. You'll be meeting dignitaries and heads of corporations, but you have never been exposed to this way of life. So trust us to know what's appropriate for you, will you? I dare say you won't be disappointed. Well, now, the picture of propriety. Isn't it a wonderful feeling? Well, there just aren't words to describe it. Seems to me we have a little something to top it off with. Tada! Oh. Oh. I think I could become a legend. Oh, yes, I always watched the contest when I was little. It's funny I hadn't thought about this before, but I used to always cry for the winner. You know, I'd take an old plumber's helper and act like it was my scepter. And then I'd march around like I was on the runway. And you never, ever dreamt that it would be up there someday? Never. I've always been shy. It was hard to picture myself competing like that. The competing was hard for me, especially the bathing suit part. Believe me, to go through the embarrassment of having a crowd stare at your derriere, you really have to want to play the piano. Really? Well, you know. You may have just touched on one of the great ironies of the contest. It's called the scholarship, but there aren't many girls up there with glasses on now, are there? Well, no, sir. But lots of contact lenses. That's very true. Let's see, Sally. You have to admit she's intelligent. I like her spunk. I still say write her speeches. Ghost her. We can't run the risk. She's a malleable girl. She won't give us any trouble. You're probably right. Well, how does your boyfriend feel about all of this? Well, sir. I haven't met that special someone yet. I grew up having the same dream as all little American girls, to be the fairest in the land. To have my pumpkin turn into a shining coach, and my rags into a glittering-- I sound like a recorded announcement. No, you sound divine. Glittering ball gown. --into a glittering ball gown. And now that my dream has come true, I'm so grateful to share the spirit of that event with each of you. Just remember not to twirl your hair, and I think you got it. Oh. Oh, want to see what the rest of our year looks like? Look here. Here we go. First stop, Houston, for the women's club of America. Tupelo Mississippi, for Trixie Perm. Chicago for Children's Hospital. Wink Taxes for new shopping center. Your visit with the president on 14th November. And then down here, Kansas City for the state wetlands convention. I counted them up. There's over 250 towns. Some of them twice. When do I go back to Wichita Falls? Oh, Thanksgiving for two days. That'll be your big homecoming. What are those numbers? Oh, oh that's your salary, pudding. What do you think? Every time you appear, somebody's paying to bask in your radiant glow. I got it. Miss [inaudible]. Yes, she is. Just a moment. Oh. It's that piano player. Miss Butterfield, this is that special someone you haven't met yet. Michael, you heard that? I was just minding my own business, watching TV after a hard day's listening to my students, and what do I hear? The woman I love denying my existence. Michael, you know that wasn't me. That was just queen talk. Besides, if I told them about you, they'd want to know all the juicy details. Listen, do you have any dates for Thanksgiving? Because I'm going to be in Wichita Falls for about two days. Well, my calendar is pretty well booked, you know. Let's see, there's Dixie and Bambi and Poopsie. Michael, I got to go. Listen, I'll call you back tonight. OK? I love you. I love you. Bye. Oh. Oh. This is for you. Sally, keep up the good work. You're a queen among queens. Avery MacPherson. Avery? Sally, keep up the good work. You're a queen among queens. Avery MacPherson. Oh. Oh, I do declare. I may have to just faint right here in San Francisco. Oh, my word. We better get back to work. Where were we now? Oh. I drew-- I grew up with the same dream all little American girls have, to be the fairest in the land, to have my pumpkin turn into a shining coach, and my rags into a glittering ball gown. OK. And now that my dream's come true, I'm so very grateful to be able to share the spirit of that great event with each of you here tonight. Thank you. [applause] I just love you. Go on back out there. Go on. Do that thing they love. Isn't she a darling. Thank you. Wow, Sal, you look like a movie star. It's just me. Agatha's going to be visiting her mom in Waco while I'm here. Oh. Has anyone seen Michael? No, Sally, we haven't seen him lately. All right, Sally. [interposing voices] Looking good. [interposing voices] Congratulations. That's super. [applause] Happy Thanksgiving. Let's get you in a hot bath this minute. Oh, Agatha, I tried your as if, and I was thinking about the Sahara desert. And it did not work. You poor little doll. Look at you, all skin and bones. When we get to Dallas, I'm going to stuff you with barbecue and Pinto beans. Oh. Agatha, I'm real tired. I'm just going to sit here a minute, all right? It's like I said, last year's queen just wore her formal during the Christmas parade, like we're supposed to be grateful she was letting you wear your fur. Agatha, I didn't even get you a Christmas present. Oh, we both know we had good excuses. Oh, that mother of mine. What do you think? Do not open until Christmas, love, mama. What have we here? Oh, my word. Oh. Oh. Well, I declare. Look at that pitiful little thing. Well, merry Christmas, Agatha. Merry Christmas, honey. [humming] Merry Christmas, Sally. Look, the car. She gave me your car. Wow. From the queen of the heir to the king of the road. I'm afraid to even open mine. I could tell how expensive it is even just from the outside of the box. A camera. She gave me a camera! It's what I wanted. I sure hope she got our presents. I mailed them early enough. Poor little thing. She's probably flying in some airplane. All alone up there in that Christmas sky. Don't worry, mom. Now, I'll give a nickel to anybody who can guess what's in this thing. I think, what do you think? A refrigerator. I think it's a kitchen. Oh. Oh. It's-- it's one of those-- A large screen TV. She really outdid herself. It's a mink coat. She gave me a mink coat. She gave me a mink coat. I look like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. Well, at least it'll match your dress. Well. You look gorgeous. Red is your color. Listen, I got a big problem. I told him I think you could handle it. The singer's snowed in in Detroit. There has to be somebody to sing the star-spangled banner. I told him I think you could handle it. With your musicianship and all, you'll be beautiful. No, I'm not a singer. I don't know how to sing. I can't sing. I don't know. I have a sore throat. First, they're going to love you for doing it. Secondly, there's going to be 60,000 people singing right along with you. It's not like it was a solo. And last, I would never ask you to do it if I didn't think you could handle it. Would I? I guess not. That's my girl. She needs to be ready in 15 minutes. And remember, keep your mouth close to the microphone. And tonight, we'll paint the town red to match your dress. You know how I feel. I feel like the tree in the Garden of Eden. That dangling snake's slithering all over the place. I can't even slap him off. Well, you have to admit he's charming. No I don't. Just because he's in the pageant don't mean the rules don't have to apply to him. Listen, I don't think I know the words to this. Help me, OK? Oh, say can you see-- I sound awful. Oh, you sound divine. Just use your as if. Let's go through it again. Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed-- You have no idea. I'm [inaudible] around the clock. We don't have an official name. And they've got tennis elbow, athlete's foot, why not beauty queen's cheeks? Well, it's not a problem I'm likely to get much sympathy with. It's like saying, oh, this mink weighs so much. Oh, you remind me. I have a little surprise for you. A surprise? Don't worry, it's not mink. You can relax your cheeks. Oh, it's beautiful. Let's try it on. Tada. Easier said than done. I love it. Thank you, Mr. MacPherson. Tell you what. I won't call you your highness if you don't call me Mr. MacPherson. My name is Avery. Thank you, Avery. You look French tonight. Trés elegant. Ever been to France, to Paris? Well, I have a bunch of cousins outside of Paris, Texas. But that's as close as I've come. I like you Sally, you're refreshing. You're not like the others. Believe me, I've seen enough to know. You're sophisticated when you want to be, but you're still genuine. I think that's amazing. You are, you know, queen among queens. I mean that. I'd like to get to know you better, if it's all right with you. Well, sure. I think that'd be fine. A toast first. To new friendship. To a new friendship. Hurry up, darling, we'll miss the plane. One for you. No thanks. I see you enough as it is right over there. Pay no attention to him, hon. Let it roll off your back. Fella's a pure creep. [music playing] Oh, look how cute you look. Agatha, that's him. It's him. Oh. I almost didn't recognize you. Am I dressed enough. You look wonderful. This must feel like knowing you're permanently on candid camera. I know. But you get used to it. - You do? I'm Agatha. Agatha. Listen, I have to appear upstairs at the banquet just for a few minutes, then we can be on our way to dinner. Our, meaning we three. One, two, three. Oh, be warned, Agatha. I'm even more dangerous than I look. You don't watch out, I'm going to start yelling a list of obscene things I'm going to do to her after dinner. Oh. Oh. Mild mannered musician. You just wish they'd rev up a little more spunk, don't you? I'll be right at the next table if you need me, I'll order two soft drinks for you. Oh. Yes. I've never been any good in hotels. I guess they're just home, now. I can't judge up this class. Hi. Hi. Oh. What's happening, Sally? Why are we frozen? I don't know. I don't know what to say. I'm very glad to see you. So it's not that. Yeah. Life keeps going on, doesn't it? I mean, you tell yourself you won't change, but you keep changing. You don't take your own advice? Look at me. I just need to get a good look at you. Michael, this is Avery McPherson, vice president in charge of public relations for the pageant. Yeah, I remember you. Sally tells me you play the piano. Is there around something we can help you with? The president of Digicorp Computers Inc. has decided that he wants you to make your speech after all. You have to be upstairs in 10 minutes. There'll be a photo session with the board directors afterwards. You're also going to have to sign copies of the new catalog, a couple hundred. I have plans with Michael. Sally, you're here for a reason. I'm sure we can appease your young friend with something from the bar. He can order anything he likes on the house. 10 minutes. Charming fellow. Michael, I'm sorry. This was supposed to be-- Yeah. Wow, you're really different in this setting, Sally. I mean, I'm seeing a completely different woman. What are you saying? It's just me. I don't know. I mean, this is just coming out. But it's like you've been wooed in the love affair with fame. And I'm-- what's happening? I don't know. I don't fit in. Where do I fit in? Michael, please. It's just hard to pick up again. We can be alone together later. How could we think we'd be different? It's been crazy. I mean, I adore you, Sally. I do. But that's just little syllables. That's nothing compared to what you're getting from your life now. And I mean, how am I supposed to compete with all of this? What can I say? Can I say come back and practice your piano? Come back and eat pecan pie with me and watch the sunset over Onion Creek? That's ridiculous. I mean, look at Prince Charming here. How in hell can I compete with that? How can I compete with your throng, Sal? You need something that I can't give you. That's not true. I need you. You need this more. I couldn't care less about all of this. That's what you say. You say that, but you do care, or you wouldn't be doing this. You care about it more than you care about being a pianist. You care about it more than you-- more than you care about being with me. So, it's that simple. [music playing] I can't tell you how very pleased I am to be able to greet you all this morning. I was very flattered when I found out that you were going to model your new All-American beauty doll after me. I hope this encourages little girls everywhere to develop the best and the most beautiful within them. Thank you. [applause] I told you who knows Sally for more than 10 minutes can help falling in love with her. Now, with such a living doll right here with us, we hardly need a substitute. But for those of you who haven't seen our All-American beauty doll, I'd like to present it to you. But first, Sally, as this company's newly appointed executive vice president in charge of marketing, I would like to present you as a token of our esteem with the very first doll off the assembly line. Could we have the lights off, please? Projector, please. It's pageant night, thunderous applause rings in Sally's ears as she floats down the runway in her sparkling silver gown and shimmering tiara. Little girls everywhere can feel shivers down their spine as they make that walk right beside her. Now, our miss All-American beauty doll will need quite a wardrobe for all those appearances she'll be making during her exciting year. Now, here she is on the beach, making quite a splash in her stunning jade swimsuit. Now, whoa there. Here's Sally our urban cowgirl. You're a high stepping beauty in your red leather cowboy boots. What cowboy wouldn't like to put you in his corral? What's Sally's favorite music? Disco. No more autographs tonight. Clear the dance floor while Sally lets her hair down, and stops the show in her fuchsia mini dress and sizzling purple tights. Now, every queen deserves to be pampered. Sally is no exception. She loves to lounge for hours in her elegant chiffon negligee and dressing gown, dreaming luxurious dreams. Every little girl's ideal of the exceptional woman she will become someday. And Sally is here, as living proof that that dream can come true. Thank you. Lights on, please. Do you believe that doll, Agatha? Don't let it ruffle you, honey. They think I'm only a doll, and it feels just awful. Sally. Sally. Sally'll see you in a minute. Something I need to discuss with her. She'll meet you downstairs. Just be a minute. Listen, I hate to catch you on the run like this, but you got another appearance, I got a plane to catch. The board just came down on me very hard about our seeing so much of each other. They told me that either I leave you alone, or I lose the account. I see. Doesn't leave me much of a choice. It's been great. You're a remarkable woman, I always told you that. Yeah, queen of queens. Listen, maybe I'll see you at the pageant. Yeah. Bye, Sal. Miss Butterfield, I'm sure you won't mind answering a few questions for us. Beauty is the measuring stick most American women feel they must live up to. Our viewers want to know. Are you proud of propagating the myth of the perfect female, or do you realize you're simply a pawn in a male dominated game? After all, Miss Butterfield, you must realize you're nothing more than a piece of meat. Leave me be, madam. Forget that nincompoop. She was just a bull seeing red, and you happened to be in the arena. And I got to iron my own dress now. See you in 10 minutes. We got to leave for the VA hospital in 15. Wait a minute. You know how hard these hospital visits are for me. Especially the men. They've been through so much more than I could ever even imagine. My speech will sound ridiculous. They're expecting you. Now, I'll see you in 10 minutes. It's like you've been wooed into a love affair with fame. You really are, you know. Queen among queens. After all, Miss Butterfield, you must realize you're nothing more than a piece of meat. If you want to get when you want, you have to give them what they want. You care about it more than you care about being a pianist. You're here for a reason. Her public is waiting. Acting as if. It seems like this life suits you. You now symbolize the ideal American woman. I just hope she's going to be happy. [screams] Oh, sweet precious baby. What have we done to you? Agatha, who am I? Who am I anymore? Nothing makes any sense. I don't have Michael. And I've lost my music, everything. Oh, honey. Sorry things worked out like this. I really mean it. Let me help you with that. Hey. How have you been? I hear you get a vacation. Yeah, but I'm going to be just fine. How are you doing? You're growing. I'm doing great. Of course, I dig being famous. Listen, I want you to do me a favor, OK? Field any phone calls from the pageant office today, OK? Would you do that for me? - Sure. I didn't know they'd worked you so hard. Excuse me, I'm looking for Michael Carrington. He seems to have moved out of his upstairs office. Mr. Carrington is on a three month leave, he's touring the East Coast with his quartet. We forward his mail if you'd like to send a note. I would, yes. You're going to be all right? I feel so fragile. And I don't want to. Honey, we're here for whatever you need. I know I'm strong. I feel that too. It's just like I've splintered into all these little pieces and I don't have the strength to pick them all up again. Oh, Sally. What they have done to you, I'm so sorry. It's not just that. I kept telling myself that it was just an accident that I got into this whole thing, but all I really wanted was the scholarship. But all along I think I knew it was something more than that. I wanted to feel loved. I wanted to feel so special that I wouldn't have to wonder who I was anymore. I could be a real somebody, and then that would be who I was. But I gave myself away. I gave a little piece of myself away to everyone I'd meet so they'd adore me. But it wasn't me they adored. They didn't know me. They didn't want to know me. They wanted something else, something I can't give them. Hon, you're their symbol. If they can watch you getting all that attention, then they can feel like that's them up there. But it's never enough. I mean, they always want more. And that's the trouble. It's never enough. If you keep looking for approval from the outside, if you're not listening to the inside, you have to know how lovable and wonderful you are right now. Exactly the way you are. And that title doesn't mean a thing. Sally, I'm just so proud that you're just plain Sally. That's what I'm proud of. I have to find my way back, mama. And you will, darling. I don't doubt that for a minute. Don't listen to me. Sounds like bad advice. But I think you ought to put your crown on in a few days and go back up there as the real Sally Butterfield. Go do it like you want to do it. If that's not all right with somebody, that's OK. It'll be all right with you. Oh, my honey. If you just want to stay home and let that pageant world go spinning by, that's OK too. You know what? I think I was a very lucky person before any of this happened. I just didn't realize it. You come on in here, you boys. Come on in and give your sister a hug because she's falling apart. Come on. [screams] I can't breathe. Oh! Hello, Agatha. Get ready to fasten your seat belt again. Now, Sally. Let's be reasonable. No queen of our pageant has ever quit. It would be a disgrace not only to you, but to everything that our contest stands for. I'm sure that you don't want to bring that kind of shame on yourself, do you? Well, no. I'm very grateful for this. You should be. And I would never have learned so much in such a short amount of time. Well then, what seems to be the problem? I want to do things differently from now on. Starting with I'd like to slow down the schedule. But Sally, you'll be losing money. And money that could go towards your education. I have plenty of money for my education now, and I won't mind the loss. Then think of the pageant. The organizations you cancel on certainly won't renew us for next year. And as a relatively new pageant, every year is critical. As I was saying, Mrs. Hunnicutt, I want to slow down the schedule. And I want to play the piano for the groups whenever there's one available. That's the way I really have something to say to the people. It's much nicer than giving one of your speeches. Now, Sally. Really, if you can't cooperate in a civil-- First of all, Mrs. Hunnicutt, I'd like to say that I hope for the sake of whoever takes over my title this year, that you will let her be herself. If she's special enough for the judges to choose her, she won't need one of your makeovers. She may make a few mistakes, but let her do it her way. That'll be a truer representation of an All-American girl. We're all different. And that's the good part. We're all special in different ways. I'll see you at the pageant. [music playing] [applause] Come feel it as I play. I'll tell you a secret. You have to sing along with the piano. You have to feel like it's part of your body. And that way the two of you can have the same voice. I didn't know you were so beautiful. What do you mean? The sounds you can make. It's because you're so beautiful in here, and you give it to us through music so we can see it too, and that's nice. I'll bet I know what you're thinking. No, you don't. It's almost over? No. You're right. Then I don't know what you're thinking. It's my birthday. It is? We have to celebrate tonight after the pageant. No. We don't have to go to the ball. I don't want to be reminded of it. Don't ask my age either. I've been lying about it for years. There, I said it out loud. Well, now that our year's over, what are you going to do? Well, I guess as long as the pageant bug keeps biting them, there'll be girls out there needing me. Of course, Texas could stand on its panhandle by the time another Sally Butterfield comes my way. Agatha. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too, honey. You know, you're the first person I've ever known who's made me feel like I could run around without my eyes and my blusher and still think I was cute. I'll tell you something else. I've never liked pretty little faces. And it's given me great pleasure to imagine that they don't have two ounces of brains underneath. But you blasted that theory all to bits. I'm not finished. You better come visit mama and me sometimes in Waco. And you better let me know how things turned out with that pianist of yours. I don't think he even wants to talk with me. I wrote him a letter trying to tell him how I feel, and he didn't even write back yet. Well, it's that time, the final runway walk. You put it on, Agatha. Don't be silly. No. Come on. Oh, for heaven's sake. No one's watching. Oh, Sal, this is ridiculous. Oh, Sal. Oh, this is silly. It isn't. I feel ridiculous. Well, you're not. Oh, nuts. No more as if's, Ag. You are the real All-American Beauty, aren't you? Look at yourself. Oh. Michael. [music playing]
