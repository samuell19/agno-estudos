DEATH IN THE FRENCH GARDEN Excuse me. Are you David Aurphet? Yes, I am. I was worried I was late. Julia Tombsthay. My husband and daughter are here, anyway. My new neighbor... Hello, I'm Edwige Ledieu. I moved in this morning. I thought we could meet right away. Good idea. Julia Tombsthay. Your husband? No, Mr. Aurphet is my daughter's guitar teacher. Oh, excuse me. Future professor... Are you happy with your movers? Very... Well... See you soon. Goodbye... Who knows? Coming? You wouldn't think you're in the city. No, you'd think you were in a garden. My new neighbor's house... I think my husband's waiting for us. We were pleased when we learnt that you were available. Isn't that true, Graham? Given your references, my husband wouldn't have any other teacher for his daughter. -By the way, where is she? -Reading in my office now. I'm coming. Viviane, my daughter. Mr. David Aurphet. -Hello. -Hello. You're able to earn a living by teaching guitar? No. I'm also a French teacher... principally. But this year, I gave up French... Will three times a week be all right? That's perhaps a little... That's fine. At your house, or here? I prefer that it be here. As do I. Here? Do you want to see my guitar? I warn you, it's pretty worthless. Better not, then... I propose that we buy Viviane a much better instrument. -It will motivate her. -When? Tomorrow? If you want. Will you help us, Mr. Aurphet? Of course. Tomorrow at 11. At the Oiseau Lyre. -What do you do? -I'm seeing you out. Sorry, I mean, my factory makes instruments for measuring vibrations. All kinds of vibrations. I think they liked you. But we didn't discuss your fee. -100... 150 francs per lesson. -Perfect. See you soon. Goodbye, sir... Tell me, honey, Can't you see you piss me off? Hello? Oh, hello. What did I lose? This... Thank you... I look like I've rushed over, but don't believe it. I didn't find your tuning fork right away. Where was it? On the couch. It had slipped... I hesitated before calling you, coming, then I changed. I hesitated about that, too. How do I look? Fine. Fine... and here we are... -Have a seat. -Sit... where? There... Let's recap. I'll sit on the bed. You're playing this at the moment? -Yes... Brahms. -That's what's playing now? -No... -How lovely. What's playing? Yes... I think my husband liked you a lot. Does the stove work? Yes, but you must wear a mask. No exterior exhaust. Can I offer you a coffee, or plum brandy? I don't have much. I'd like that. -Brandy... -Yes... -I like your place. -Too bad, I move in 5 days. -And why? -A habit. Shall we organize a date now, or wait till you have an address? Thank you. It's a small place, isolated, in a park... surrounded by other houses... So it's not alone, then. Yes. The others have been demolished. One day, your place will also be demolished. -Yes... -And you'll move again. Yes... As for the next meetings, we'll wait a little. Yes... -You have a pretty ring. -Yes. Know why you're so desirable at the moment? Yes... no. Because you're not trying to be. I'll be on my way. Watch your head! Hi, Dad. What? Yes, my boy, your Mom's coming back. -You pleased? -Yes. But I'll need time to get used to it. -When does she return? -In 2 weeks. Frankly, I never knew what she saw in that Swiss. And your bomb, it's coming along? It's coming along... What are you doing these days? Stuffing my face, then going to buy a guitar. For yourself? No, for the lady. Perhaps that one will do? Which would you choose for yourself? If price weren't an issue, this one. So be it, darling. Now I know how much it costs to make you more agreeable. Thank you, see you tomorrow. -I don't like that boy. -Me either. Can we see each other this afternoon? I'd like that. -At the same time? -Yes... I'm parked over there. -Is that her boyfriend? -I don't know. Probably. Does your husband not care, too? He spoke to me about you again. He'd like to hear you play. I didn't tell you last night, but I think you're beautiful. See you soon. I can't wait. -Hello. -Hello. -Things are going well? -Well. Your move, I mean. Yes, I've just got to hang a few things on the wall. -Photos? -Among other things. Can I... offer you a drink? Why not? Been teaching guitar to my neighbor's daughter for long? No, tomorrow's the first lesson. You've always lived here, or are you from somewhere else? No, I've always lived here. With my mother. She died 3 weeks ago. -Just 3 weeks ago... -Oh, I... You had a look at her cleavage? -Ah. .. yes. Daring. -Plunging! You could count the hairs on her pussy. Did you count? -I didn't look that far down. -Really? Miss! There's a little fly in the gentleman's drink. I don't see anything... David, you swallowed it. -Seventeen. -That's all? Not enough time. Have you noticed how blondes' pussies differ from brunettes'? Quite different. You can't see anything with brunette pussies. I'm a brunette, as I hope you've noticed... You can't see anything. It's hidden, buried away, in the thick hair. A brunette's pussy is mysterious. And therefore, very exciting, yes?. With blondes... Do you want me to call the waitress back? You really get to see the pussy. A blonde's covering is so fair, so fine... It's transparent. -Therefore, more immodest, no? -Yes. No. It's more innocent. Reminds one of little girls' pussies. -And a redhead's pussy? -I've never seen one. -But I'm still young. -Me too. Where's my cane? There it is. I've got to get home. Thank you. Why do you stay with your husband? Because I love him. And him? He loves me, too. No... No, maybe he hates me. I don't know. I don't know him very well. -You hate him, too. -I don't know. You don't know yourself very well. What does this drawing mean? A magic sign. It "bolsters" the pillow. Do you get it? Yes... Yes, I do. I had a drink with your neighbor this morning... At her house? No, in town. And? She talks a lot. That's all? I wonder if she saw us say goodbye in front of the shop... Obviously she saw us. You don't know me very well. -Hello, I'm just leaving. -Hello. I hope you will be pleased with Viviane. I'll try to do my best. Before I go: my wife and I would like you to come for dinner. -Pleasure. -Next Monday? -Fine. -Julia will fill you in. I leave him to you. See you later, Mr. Aurphet. Come. She's in her room. Hello, Madam. -He loves you, it's obvious. -I hate you. Can I keep calling you "Mrs."? It's more arousing. I might not be free tomorrow. See you later. Work hard. I like your home. It feels like one is elsewhere. -Yes, but one really is here. -That's its charm. Good. Perhaps the right hand should be more... flexible. Did my mother tell you that I sleep with everyone? -No, why would she? -And if it were true? It's your own business. My mother likes you. And when she likes someone... That's my business. Yes. Bye. See you Friday. Hello. Hello... What an unexpected surprise! You've bought some records? Can I have a look? I can tape a few records for you if you want. -Rare ones. -I bought this, as well. Can I... Can I invite you for a drink? Why not. The street side... The Tombsthay side. -Those are your photos? -Guess. -Yes... -Or not... -Some coffee? -No. I would. I'll bring you an orange juice. I'd prefer a cognac. Put on a record, you choose. Then go for a look around the house. Back soon. Know what I was thinking to myself? I have a "nice backside", as they say, "a cute arse", as they also say... Mine's not too bad... Can I touch it? Excuse me? Do you think I'm a melon? "Can I touch it?" We're not at the Montelimar market, my friend. Cavaillon. Montelimar is for nougat. -What's Cambrai, then? -Near to Waterloo. Exactly, the Berezina. We'll say no more about it. Did you know my esteemed neighbor, Graham Tombsthay, is wooing me? -That's not true. -Quite right. In fact, not true. How could it be possible, I've only known him for two days. Between us, in two days, obviously not... Sometimes I say pointless things as well! Could you turn that lamp on over there? If you want to go and look out the window, do it! The Tombsthay side... The street side. You like night-time? For you, how does it differ from the day? It's like... day and night! -No children outside at night. -Or buses. Do you know this poem? "The time of day when the children roam the streets... "The time of day when... beautiful women run around." -Yes, it's by me. -Only half of it. Do you know who that woman is? A whore. Do you like whores? I saw her one night behind the Prefecture, in the shadow of a streetlight. The streetlight was broken. -And then? -Oh, another time... I... find you very elegant this evening. Me, too. You're going to be late. And my mother's waiting for me! Put your hands flat. Your wallet? In my back pocket. -Are you hurt? -No, just a clumsy kick. -I can call a doctor. -It'll be all right. Thanks for helping out. The crook stole my wallet. -You okay? -Yes... Can I offer you a drink? Great, but I don't want to disturb you. Are you kidding? -Still hurt? -It's gone. One moment, I'll just go put some water... Let me have a look. He had powerful hands. Not too bad. You'll have a bruise. Sit down. Will you file a report? I don't know. Maybe for my ID papers. -Could you see the guy? -Not very well. He wasn't young. You were scared? Yes, a little... I think I've seen you before. Two days ago, and yesterday, in a car. You have a gray Rover, don't you? Yes. I've got a job here in the city, which leaves me a lot of free time. If you weren't there, he would have knocked me out. I don't think so. Otherwise he'd have done it right away and then robbed you. But he... He was aiming for your hand, not your head. But why? You're a musician? A guitarist? Yes. If he'd struck you with this, he would have smashed your hand. -You do it for a living? -Yes. And the wallet? To lead you off the track. The first idea that comes to mind... -A jealous husband... -I don't know any of those. I said, just imagine. -Can I ask your name? -Daniel Forest. And yours? David Aurphet. You're very clever... ...in your deductions. My professional training, I suppose. -What do you do? -You wouldn't believe me. You'll think I'm crazy. Tell me anyway. My job is to get rid of people. You... You're a killer? An ugly word... but yes. If it's true, I don't think you would have told me so quickly. You're mistaken. One makes this kind of admission without thinking. Because the desire to do so is too strong. And you have... a job to do in this city? Yes... Excuse me. I felt a sudden need to talk... -You've killed before? -Yes. I'll go. You're not worried that I'll report you? I know when I can trust people. I'm never wrong. Be careful. Here's my telephone number. Feel free to call me. Even for no reason... I'd be pleased to see you again. You're thinking that it's dangerous to know a killer? I assure you that it's not. My neighbors... goodbye. -Thank you, again. -You're welcome. -See you again, maybe. -Maybe. I love you... My hands love you... My legs love you... My stomach loves you... My mouth loves you... My eyes love you, we love you so much. And you? Me? I don't love myself much. Come now! Except when I love you. -I was frightened! -Of me? No... I always hear it before it rings... Hello? No, of course not. Tomorrow evening. Yes... Yes... We'll do that. Eight o'clock. Till... The man who saved you yesterday, -that was him on the phone? -Yes. He invited me to dinner tomorrow night. -At his house? -No. You don't think it odd he was there when you were attacked? And your husband... Would he be capable of sending someone to smash my hand? Yes. He can become quite violent. But with you... No, I doubt it. Why not? -He would have told me. -Are you sure? No, not totally. I'm getting old, it's a drama. Not a tragedy, a drama. Bye. I won't be home later. Be good with Viviane. -She's a beautiful girl. -Very. -Very good? -Very beautiful. I'm going to the country. I'll miss Monday's lesson. That works out well, I'll be moving. -Can I ask you something? -Of course. I'd like to film your fingers while you play. So I can study the position of the fingers. -Goodbye. -Is it nice, where you're moving? Yes. A house surrounded by trees. -You'll be living alone? -Yes. Goodbye... I didn't want to leave. Am I disturbing you? No, I've almost finished. A friend is coming to pick me up, but a bit later. -My piece? -Yes. Want some coffee? I was just making some. No thanks. A piece of Gruyere, some plum brandy...? Oops, none left... A frozen mushroom, ham and cheese pancake? No, nothing at all, thank you. Does the stove work? No, that's why I'm moving. You've a lovely ring. Yes, I inherited it from my mother. -Do you know this house? -No... Can you call me a taxi? Thank you. One of my students. Why am I telling you that? Yes, why tell me that? Shall we go? Yes, just let me change. It's Saturday, the restaurant is full. We'll go to my place. That's not a problem? No. Nice apartment. Your pupil, the one I just saw. I think I've seen her before. -I wonder... -No need to wonder. It was when you were walking in her neighborhood. Don't think I've been up to anything with her, and that her father sent a hand-smasher so I could no longer teach her. I'm not thinking anything. It's you doing the thinking... Why did you smile a few days ago when you looked at my neck? Smile? I don't remember... Ah, yes! But I shouldn't... I told you that you'd have a bruise. Getting a bruise from a bruiser. You don't think that's funny? Yes. It's good to laugh a bit. Why? Your job isn't fun? Sometimes... Does it take long... a contract? Yes. I don't gun people down on the street two hours after receiving the order. I'm... meticulous. And expensive. -You're pulling my leg. -I promise you, I'm not. What do you have to do here, exactly? Kill a man and steal an item from him. An object? -In which is hidden... -Microfilm, no doubt! Yes. If you don't believe me, stop asking questions. It's true, this is like an interrogation. What was the guy like? Normal? Suspicious? Sinister? No, not sinister. OK, he had... A head like a spoon? Like a small spoon? Or like a big spoon? Or was his head always shaded? OK, a... shady... look, very well, but not si... nis... ter. So what's on these microfilms? I don't know, and I don't want to know. Sometimes diplomatic secrets, sometimes scientific secrets, or industrial secrets. In this case, probably industrial. I don't know what to think of you. Don't think anything. It doesn't affect you, killing people? Do you really want to discuss it? -How did it begin? -Very simply. You meet someone who knows someone. You wait 2 years. And after that you meet someone who suggests introducing you to someone who could offer you something interesting. -How old are you? -Forty. -Never got married? -No, never. And you? Thank you. Good luck with the move. Call me if you want, I'd like that. -Hello? Edwige Ledieu? -Yes. Thanks for letting me come so soon. What's that, a porno film? I don't know. An anonymous gift... Push this button here. I'll leave you. -Hello? -David. -I received... -Me, Too. I've been trying to call you. -Is it your husband? -I don't know. I'm calling from your neighbor's. -Having a change of heart? -No. -Are you alone? -Yes. Can you come out on the terrace? Yes... Hello... Your dinner tonight, should I come, or find an excuse? -You must come! -Are you enjoying this? -And you? -No. Did my neighbor watch the videotape? No. You'd like her to see you... ...naked, making love to you? I'd have liked that. See you this evening! Can I come back? I'm waiting... Me too. Don't forget the drinks, I'm thirsty. So then, the videotape? I imagine you heard everything. Not at all, I heard a click and thought you'd hung up. It was the other one, but don't tell me who it was! Come on, don't sulk, and tell me the story. -It was indeed a porno. -Will you show me? Someone took it upon themself to film my... most private life. -You, by yourself? -No, there was someone else. Let me guess. A married woman? -Yes. -The old story. -Either it's the husband... -Or it's not the husband. No, I mean, some wacko. They do exist! -I even met one recently... -Bring him over here! Or it's you. No, pardon... No, I... Don't excuse yourself. It was I. I like to have fun. -Are you serious? -Are you? -I don't know. -Nor do I, then. -Speaking of tape, you promised. -Sorry. You haven't had the time? No. I think that... I'm a little drunk. And a little crazy. But I don't care. Now go. -Hello. -Hello. I'm just here for the lesson. I'm moving in with some friends. -You'll be able to go there? -Yes. Don't worry, my parents will keep paying you. I'm not worried at all. -I'm sorry. Are you mad at me? -No. And if I don't join you tonight, you won't be mad? No... A great car, but the fifth gear takes a while. That's true. You've got to get on all fours on the passenger side, dust yourself off, take your seat again, and thank God if there's no curve. Excuse me... I think he likes you very much. Come through here, it's better. It doesn't seem like he's received the tape. Don't trust the way he looks. I hope you will agree to play something for us. Sorry, I didn't bring my guitar, and I think that Viviane took hers. By the way, did you see, she brought out the VCR. We gave her a VCR and a video camera. They amused her a bit... Have you seen what beautiful hands he has? You have to watch out for your hands with your job? Yes, one imagines things... At least a guitar is less dangerous than a car, or motorbike. By the way... talking about it, I had an accident today, a very minor one. I had stopped at the lights, and someone ran into me from behind. The guy, or should I say road hog, clearly under the influence of a few drinks, got out, went to the back of his own car and called out to me, "It's all right, there's no damage!" You should be careful, my darling... You've had a tiring day. Look how much David resembles your younger brother. Excuse us. What were we talking about? Oh, yes, the accident... Thanks for coming here so late. I've looked around the house, I didn't see anything. I didn't hear you. -You don't look too good. -I drank too much today. OK, I'll ask you the question again: does anyone have any reason to hold a grudge against you? Tell me everything. From the beginning. -Do you want some coffee? -Yes, with lots of sugar. Is there any more? Stories about jealous husbands are commonplace, but they can be dangerous. Don't forget, people are crazy. Sorry to have bothered you, but I panicked. I'm afraid. In this house that doesn't lock, or so badly... -Want me to stay here tonight. -Yes? You don't mind? Not at all. I've been thinking about it. Best if you don't see that woman for the next few days. Or her daughter, or anybody. You, if need be... Do you still go walking in the park? Yes, I went yesterday. Why? This Mrs. Tombsthay, could she have... -The attack? -For instance... The video? Naturally I'd thought about it. I think she fell into your arms a bit too quickly. I think that you're under my feet a bit too much. Really? You think that? I'm sorry. I've already made a fool of myself today with the Tombsthay's neighbor. I asked her straight out if she sent the tape. -What did she say? -She said she had. Do you feel unwell? Sorry. This happens every now and then. When I arrived in this city, I remember thinking that I would die here. What does that feel like? It depends. It changes... I don't have any pajamas to lend you. It doesn't matter. Good night. Good night. -Morning. -Hello. Have you seen this wind? -You know what woke me? -The wind! No, the smell of the toast. It's like the smell of coffee. Perhaps it was the smell of coffee. No, the coffee smell doesn't wake me. Have you sorted out your ID papers? No, not yet. It's nice not being anyone. It would be better to be someone else. -Who? -And how? And why? I suppose you often change. Change identities, I mean. Sometimes. The police! -I came... -Blew in! To see your house, and invite you to come over this evening! No, no more meals at your house! Graham is going away for three days this afternoon. Did you know my dear husband had a boyfriend some years ago? More than one, perhaps... It smells nice here. Will you show me around? Would you like a tour? No, since you're busy. Will you come? Is that all the effect I have on you? Your pulse hasn't quickened a bit. You know I'm more of a night person... See you tonight. Not at your place, I don't like it. But we must. It's much more interesting at my place. David, I'm off, but before I leave, let me say something: beware of Graham Tombsthay. -He's about to go on a trip. -That doesn't change anything. Believe me, you should stop seeing that woman for a while. Daniel, thanks for everything. You've been very kind... Graham Tombsthay is the man I have to eliminate. -And then steal... -Steal what? -What is this microfilm thing? -A small antique globe. -And you're going to kill him? -Yes. -What... -...an embarrassing... -...situation. -Yes. If you're worried, come stay at my place tonight. You know, the people to be eliminated are often dangerous. I'm seeing Julia Tombsthay tonight. At her place. Don't worry, I'll be careful. I brought a gun last night, just in case. I'll leave it, if you want. It's small and ugly, but effective and silent. It will do much better than a kitchen knife. It's loaded. That's the safety catch. OK, thanks. What about you? I have another one. Much larger. -HeHo? -It's me. -Hi, Dad. -It's ready. -What's ready? -It's a surprise. Hurry over. OK, then, I'm coming over. -So, then? -You took your time. Come on, let's go down to the cellar. Here it is. I've finished. It's wonderful. -What's it good for? -Nothing. To prove I could. So the company was wrong to fire me. Hooray! You'll be the first to win a prize for early retirement! Look, it's so simple. You set the timer on the dial, 1 minute, 5 minutes, press here and goodbye! Imagine, if you were to set this off under a horse, for example, there'd be no more horse. The teeth, hooves, horns... Wait, horses don't have horns... The skin, the bones... all gone. Pulverized. Just a thimbleful. If I gave that to you, would you ask me: "Is that a horse?" No, but what did the horse do to you? -Hello, Mr. Aurphet. -Hello, Mr. Tombsthay. Viviane shouldn't be long. Not only does she disturb you outside of the lessons, but on top of that, she's late. It doesn't really matter. What a day! I was supposed to catch a plane, but at the last minute it was cancelled. Come in. Where is Julia? Mrs. Tombsthay is in her room, or elsewhere. Who knows? She's so strange, and lies so well. You too, I must say. But it's time for me to end this game. And, I must congratulate you on your acting skills! Although now, cameras run on batteries. Before, they were spring-loaded. Quite right! Did you think, my pretty sir, that I'd let you fuck my wife with impunity? On your knees. On your knees! I'm going to kill you, cutie. If you only knew how much I'll enjoy it! It's all been planned out. Failed robbery, attack, self-defense. If need be, a "crime of passion". Are you afraid? I bid you farewell, seducer! Someone is going to kill you! Steal your globe and kill you! Well done! You've won a moment's reprieve. Tell me what you mean... -What's going on? -I've killed Graham... What? Two bullets... You'd better get rid of this. Or return it to your friend. It's his, isn't it? Don't touch anything! Come with me. I'm calling the police. But first, we've got to make it look like a robbery... You like it? Take it, I'll say it was stolen. It's beautiful. It must be expensive. It's exactly what would be stolen. Do you know its true value? Better than you think. It meant a lot to Graham. You're not able to? Here. Now, leave... I feel so good all of a sudden! You wouldn't understand. We can't meet for a while. It's too dangerous. We mustn't call each other, either. But how will I know about you? If you don't hear anything, everything's fine. If not... I'll find a way of warning you. Come on, go! And take care of yourself. Come in! Good morning! I'm coming! That's how it is. My eyes hurt today. That said, don't take anything I say too seriously! I found it! It was in the kitchen. You look rather strange. Is something wrong? My neighbor's death? Did you hear? But of course, you knew him. Needs more salt. Lots of action since this morning! The police questioned me. I saw nothing! I dined out and got home at three. I knew you'd be interested. That's why I called you, not just to thank you for the tapes. I also wanted to show you my recent photos... Nothing amazing, but I like them. It's only a selection, of course. What I like in this one is that Mrs. Tombsthay seems different. You might say lost, distraught. It suits her. It makes you want to take her in your arms, no? And look, her husband. I didn't really like him much. He seems happy. But you can't see what he's looking at. A snake, perhaps, or his daughter... No, it wasn't the same day. Viviane, isn't it? The name doesn't suit her. But then again, I'm called Edwige... The teacher and his pupil. Did you know that whenever you go in or out of my neighbors', you always glance in my direction? It's very flattering. The girl has regained her airs and graces. What was I saying? But you never saw me. Am I mistaken? No, I'm not mistaken. That's the most recent. One hesitates, wonders, but doesn't ring. You did the right thing, I was too busy to answer. Finally this one, taken from further away. I kept it because it's the first photo I took of you. A moment later you led me to that sordid bar with that hussy of a waitress. I was so embarrassed. That's it. I hope you've had a pleasant time. We'll keep the sound of your voice for next time. You were right to warn me. Have you seen the newspapers? Come. Do you know who we suspect? Tombsthay's wife. And you can bet the globe's gone. You came here to tell me that? I'm afraid for you, and I want to help you. It makes no sense. If Julia wanted to kill him yesterday, why invite me over? What do you know? Perhaps you're part of the plan without knowing. Take off. Leave me alone. I'm afraid for you. What did you do with my pistol? I hid it in the power meter cupboard. Bye. Bye. It was a pleasure knowing you. -What's happening? -Viviane's been kidnapped. You know what ransom they're asking for? -The globe. -How did you guess? You kept insisting that I take it... I seem to recall you being very interested in it. -Was it a man who called you? -Yes. -What was his voice like? -Like yours. You seem to be keeping bad company at the moment. Yes. Go away. Go home. I'll go and get the globe. Don't worry, she's alive. -Seducing minors, now... -Yes, that's it. We can't leave her there. I'll explain first. Then your sarcasm. But I'll leave before that. You bore me, David. Viviane... Viviane... So there it is. I took her, and I brought her back. Nice of me. This is just a sample of the pressure I can exert. You're not the strong ones, Mrs. Tombsthay and you. Do you believe me? -What happened? -Don't worry, it's over now. He's my friend. We're at my new place. Rest. I'll see my friend to the door, then I'll be back. Do you know the word "picaresque"? You think I'm illiterate, too? Poor David... You're the one who's been telling stories! The night your mistress's husband was killed, you were there. I followed you. Because I was uneasy... about you. Mrs. Tombsthay is cunning. A break-in? I saw it all from the park. Why wait till now to tell me this? Because I wanted you to be the one to tell me first! Fine, then. I killed him! Unbelievable! You're still trying to defend her! I saw her kill her husband. On the terrace, in front of the French windows. Are you going to try to deny it? It's starting again! You're crazy. Take off! You make me sick. I don't know exactly what you two are up to, but I'm certain that you have the globe. Do you know the orders I got this morning? To retrieve it, at any cost. And eliminate the person who stole it. You cheated me, David. You make me sick. You've already said that. Come on, admit that it's you that has it, David. Admit it! Yes, I have it. In that case, you now know what I have to do. I warned you. I'm sorry. David... It's you who make me sick! -Do you feel better? -I'm OK. -Is your friend in trouble? -Yes, he lost his car keys. -Shall I take you home? -Yes, please. -To your parents' place? -No, to my friends'. Thank you for everything. Did my parents hurt you? Yes, I believe so. They enjoy that. At least, they did. I tried to warn you... And I told you it was my business. You know... I'm not very pleased with myself, either. Hello? It's Julia. Did you receive... Yes, just now. Have you seen it? Yes. Can I be recognized? By someone who knows you, yes. Was it filmed from your neighbor's? Maybe. I can't tell. Got to go. Someone's here. Be careful... Daniel? Where were you? Around the house. It's a large place. -Why? What do you want? -The globe. It's buried in the garden with your pistol. I thought it was in the power meter cupboard. You've lied non-stop to me. Take it and scram. And please, put that away. You don't understand, David. I have to kill you. I said the deal would be finished today, and it will be. Stop it, Daniel. Think! What are you going to do? I'll take a holiday, like I always do after a job. I will send the globe to Felix Andre. Felix, that's his first name. General Delivery, rue Turgot, Paris 9. Soon after, I will receive my pay here, same way. P.O. Box 51, at the central post office. Mr. Dominique Lenaour, that's my name in this city, will receive 300,000 francs, and he'll never be heard from again. Despite what you believe, the most important deals, and the most dangerous, take place simply by mail. I didn't take the microfilms. Won't you check? No, I told you, I always know when someone lies. At least, almost always... If you had believed me... Did Julia lie to me? I don't know her. But without her, we wouldn't be here like this. I'm sorry, David, but there's nothing else I can do... Goodbye, David. Daniel! GOOD LUCK, DAVID. I received another tape. So did Mrs. Tombsthay. Filmed from your place, wasn't it? I don't like your tone. How does your story about the whore end? What whore? I don't know any whores. -The tape, it was you? -Yes. -The first time, as well? -No. -I know. -You gave me the idea. Do killers make you... No. Excuse me, I was going to say... I'll try again. Killers... Sorry, I'll start again. -Do you like killers? -Do you? Have you watched your tape? I haven't. Mrs. Tombsthay has. You can call her Julia. Did she tell you about it? No, I already know what happens. -You certain? -Please, no! Please, allow me this pleasure! You recognize yourself, Mr. Aurphet? Even filmed by me? From far away, and at night-time. Not easy! Impossible to mistake him, it's Mr. Tombsthay. I never heard the gunshot with all that wind. I couldn't make out why Mr. Tombsthay fell. I saw you throw down the revolver, then I understood. What a strange idea to throw it away. Is that what's called "losing one's head"? Anyway, end of act one, or rather, the first set, for in fact it's the second. The match is in three sets. A few minutes earlier... I assume that you recognize Mrs. Tombsthay. That's what intrigued me. I rushed for my camera... What was Mrs. Tombsthay watching so intently in Mr. Tombsthay's study? Now on to the third set. You've just shot Mr. Tombsthay, and rushed into the salon. Now, look carefully! You missed Mr. Tombsthay. He's merely injured. But, surprise, surprise, Mrs. Tombsthay returns. She picks up your revolver and... ...match point! Mrs. Tombsthay didn't miss Mr. Tombsthay. The curtain falls. Well played, Julia! Don't be a bad loser. The blame perhaps lies... Yes, I know. I fell into her arms a little too quickly. What are you going to do? Leave... tomorrow. I hope to come into some money. And... until tomorrow? I don't know. Would you like to stay here? Yes. -Is your mother well? -Yes. I start working with her next week. -What do the two of you do? -Detective work. -That can't be true... -Do you take me for a liar? And the cane? I collect them. The day I moved, I was holding one, so I limped... Why? To get your attention, Mr. Aurphet. Now I remember the story about the whore! What whore? I don't know any whores. She was waiting for a customer by the broken streetlight. A guy comes up and asks, "How much?" She says, "200". He says, "No, that's too much, 150." She says, "No, 200." He says, "Too bad," and heads off. He soon returns. He says, "OK, 200." She says, "No, 250." The guy's taken aback. "But..." She says, "Now, it's 250." He says, "Why?" She says, "That's the way it is." He leaves. Soon he returns, saying, "OK, then, 250." Now the woman hesitates. Finally she says, "OK, but I hope you fuck well, because you haven't got a clue about business." -No, don't leave. -"David. .. " Please I think you know everything now. Yes, it was me who killed him. He hated me. I hated him. And I loved him. And you... You happened to come by... I'd have preferred you to be strong enough to kill him all by yourself. You proved yourself pretty clever as well, though. That globe... You and your friend were already after the globe when we met. No. It's no drama. But you've aged as well. We're through. I'm through with you. I'll... carry on somewhere else. "And the cursed lovers never meet again. " A pity. I could have loved you. Goodbye. My respects to you, "my neighbor." If anyone comes out of this well, it's you: rich and loved. Off you go. All the best to Viviane. And my congratulations. I can't stay, but I'll be back... soon! Look, I still have it! I wrote that I was going to commit suicide. Don't believe it. It was a joke! I'm going on a trip. -Do you want to come with me? -Yes. When? Right now. I'll get my things ready. Come... I'm ready.
