I’m used to this colour and I really don’t want to change it. - If it needs to be done, then why not. Do you have a style in mind? - I’m not sure, I’m feeling so confused right now, no idea what to do. - Why confused? What will you be doing there? - I will be teaching Russian grammar and literature to children. - Oh, dear! - That’s why I must look presentable. - Here is the range of colours that are going to look presentable. - I have no idea how to choose one. - I wish you all the best at the new place. - Thank you! That's all. You’re carrying it. I am drawing the word “enough” in white chalk on the asphalt. Oh god, I’m so old. - How old are you? - 25. - I’m in shock. - Everyone is in shock. Where are your hands, where are your hands, let’s raise our hands, raise our hands and dance. Hey, what’s wrong? Everything will be okay. What are you doing? Oh the bell has rung already? Come on in, take a seat. You have made it to geography class, as you may have guessed from the schedule. I don’t know how strict it is here with everyone standing up... when the teacher enters, and so on. It’s strict? What are we going to do? Alright, let’s have you stand. Let’s all greet each other then. Hello! Great! Take a seat. I really want to have a relationship with each of you as an individual, I think it’ll be great if you all just say your name and something about yourself… Are you both Daniels? - My name is Bogdan. - Oh Bogdan, I’m sorry. - Alexander Gordeev, I came here from the Donetsk region. - Katya. I want to go home. - You want to go home. Okay. Vasily Sergeevich Haritonov, you can write it down if you need to. If there are no questions… - Are you here for long? - For two years at least, and then we’ll see. My name is Ekaterina Alexeevna. I’m going to teach Russian and literature, and I’m a new teacher in your school. You’re scaring me… I’m asking you to prepare… a presentation of a book. I don’t want to yell, please! - I haven’t read any. - Me neither. I’ll finish my thought. Either one that you read this summer — don’t do that — or just your favorite book. Can I trust you? - No. - I can’t trust you? - Not in our class. - That’s too bad. You have a low self-opinion. You’ll manage. I believe in you. - No! - In that case you’re going to prepare for the first class, that’s it. I think geography is a really cool subject, and additionally I don’t think it’s too difficult. If you just attend classes, and work a little at home, do your homework, you don’t have to be super smart in order to understand everything we’re going to cover in geography. - What was your grade in geography? - I don’t remember, an A or a B. - Did you serve in the army? - I have very bad vision, so I wasn’t accepted into the army. But I really enjoy being outdoors, hiking in the mountains, kayaking. - Do you enjoy teaching geography? - I’m going to figure that out in the process. I’ve never taught geography before. I've taught other subjects. In our school… - Vanya is playing on his phone. Put your phone right here. Boys and girls, he just put his phone away and came back. It's not funny. Dear colleagues. Thank god that we are moving away... from the position that education is a service. No, it’s not a service. It’s a public policy directed... at the shaping and education of the next generation. And you are essentially the sovereign’s people. Like the military, the FSB, and others — you are responsible for the security of our nation, to make sure it doesn’t fall apart, that it prospers, and continues to exist. I wish you success and good students. - Really all my kids are good. - There’s no such thing as bad kids. - All of my children lead a healthy lifestyle. We don’t smoke, we don’t drink, and encourage others to follow suit. - I don’t smoke or drink either. - Do you smoke? - I… do a little. - And immediately Vasily felt himself back in 8th grade. - When young teachers come, what do we expect from them? For them to do what to our stagnant swamp? To activate it. “A crow will never be a cow, a frog will never fly in the clouds…” - What? “A crow will never be a cow, a frog will never fly in the clouds…” - You didn’t prepare again? - I want to sleep! - Me too, what can you do. - What time do you get up? - At seven. No, I leave at seven. So I’ve looked over your essays… - And realized that we’re dumbasses? - Of course not…Why do you... - That’s how it always used to be. - Oh jeez. I want to talk to them about self-reflection under the guise of literature. About self-awareness, about different processes... that are going on inside them, which they’re not aware off. Or maybe they are aware of them, I don’t know. Maybe I just think that they’re simple, but they’re actually very complicated. And understand everything about themselves, and I’m the only one... who doesn’t know anything about myself. - I never liked self-reflection. At all. You want to give them a moral education and so forth. Honestly it’s hard for me to make models, to make predictions. Really you have to understand that it’s not up to you... to just do it all and totally take over the process, it is a dialogue after all. I don’t know. I really just want to tell them about our world. Why do you buy garlic in the supermarket and it says “Made in China.” I want them to think about that. - I really want to show the girls that self-actualization... is cool, and shouldn’t be through family. I mean it can be through family, but that’s not the most common version, and that’s not always okay. I want to change perceptions about what girls should do. I am very pro-feminism, yeah. - Yeah. “The woman’s position in modern society.” "the most beautiful, kind for the modern time" — what — creatures? People? - Yeah, people. - Then you should have elaborated, like, why they are the most kind. For example, because female aggression is forbidden. A girl is not allowed to get angry and she grows up helpless. How do you say “human” in Uzbek? - Hamkorlike. - How? Why are you embarrassed? How do you say “human”? Hamkorlike. - Hamkorlike? What don’t you understand? - Anything. - Anything? Nothing at all? Maybe we should start with the alphabet? I’m serious. I really don’t understand where we should start. I’ve never taught Russian to a foreigner. I don’t know how to do it. Give me the wiper. And now take it again, wash it and wipe the blackboard. Boys! - He wrote more than the others. - No, he wrote most of all. It doesn’t matter. Wipe the blackboard to make it clean. And wash the wiper again. Boys, I will send away those who doesn’t want to be here, okay? Come on. Come on. - May I please go out? - What is colored in with this bright color? - It's like women nagging at men. - We are discussing demographics right now, let’s not get distracted. In general are there more men or women being born based on this chart? Men. Why don’t they live as long? - Because we carry everything on ourselves, we crumple. - Oh, did you crumple a lot? - Yes. - Nikita, how do we translate that into regular language? - We labor, and they don’t do anything. - That’s not true. - Yeah right. If you take a look you’ll see that on average women work no less than men. In our class, by the way, they may even work more. - Who’s doing any work? She just blows her nose and says, “My finger hurts.” I like her work a lot. Your opinion is very subjective. - She can work outside of class too. - Okay Nikita. What other causes can you name? Well in actuality, biologically, it’s a little more difficult for men to live, because they are more prone to stressors - On the head… Hey you! - You can go to… - You can leave class and figure it out.. Nikita and Vanya! I need to split all of you who talk a lot into two teams. Come up to the front of the class, we’re going to have an intellectual debate. - Can we punch? - You’re an animal, you understand? You’re the animal, there’s three of us here, let’s go. - You three are like one of me. - I’m ready! - I’m ready! - Alright we’re not doing the game, sit down. I’m going to algebra. See you later. Good bye! - What holiday is today? - Teacher day! - Of course! We’re going to have you go through a series of trials. Are you truly prepared for such a difficult, but interesting process as scholastic work? Are you ready? Ekaterina Alexeevna, you start. That’s the children’s favorite activity — making eyes at you. Where are the hands? Let’s raise our hands and dance. Now we want to have you try an amazing drink made out of students’ and teachers’ tears, in order to understand how difficult it all is. This is real, drink away. Well now you are worthy of the distinguished title of teacher. Happy trails, young educators! Stand up and stay! Why are you taking up everyone’s time? Should I go down the class list? When I asked you to put the phones down, could you not have stood up and told me they were at home? I’ve had enough, I’m fed up. The difference between battles and debates is that here it’s important not to insult you or your point of view, but to competitively dispute it. That is important to understand. Cell phones should be taken away from students during class. One team agrees with this statement. The other team says no. Let’s go. Our team’s opinion: in the 21st century, the era of technology, the phone and the internet have become an important part of life, and the old school… - 10 seconds. - Crap… basically, if you take away our phones, you take away a part of our lives, and education becomes bad… - If you don’t understand what the teacher is saying, pick up a textbook and read it. If you don’t get it, go up to the teacher and he’ll explain. - You can find answers online. You can ask any question, many questions. And if you keep asking the teacher the whole class, he won’t be able to teach. - Why can’t we solve problems, train our mind, and each time solve them better. That will allow us to get better grades… - You’ll lose your mind. - The internet perverts people. And during class it becomes a reason not to pay attention to the teacher. - There is the problem of teacher’s bias. - To Sasha. I have two “plus ones” for rhetoric. You had a great performance. Awesome job overall. - We go on the starting pistol. - I forgot. - One, two, and begin. - Manicure. - Nails? Polish? Painting your nails? - Instrument. - Fingernail file. - Yes. A large ship. - A cruise ship? The Titanic? - Yes. - You got bitten by a mosquito and you got a… - Scap, itch. - No it’s a very southern mosquito, a tropical one. - Fever? Okay, next one. - A woman’s sock. - Hose. - It’s long. - Leggings. Haha, long socks. - You can wash with it, you can sniff it. - Powder? Good. - A large sign. - Poster? Perfect. - We went fast. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7… - Wow. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7… - You’re not like the old teachers who have been here forever — you do creative things with us, we don’t just sit and write facts and drill. And you don’t scream. That’s really important, when you’re just a little late, there’s immediately yelling and trouble. - Well really we just don’t know how to maintain discipline. It’s difficult to not yell and at the same time… - Any discussion leads where it needs to. And you have to have a specific goal: what do you want to get across to the kids? I just want to feel them out, what kind of kids I’m dealing with. - It doesn’t matter, Katya. You’re a teacher now, you’re not just some lady from the street, do you understand? You’re not just realizing your hopes and dreams. You are a teacher. How are you going to feel them out? You have to bring them to the thing that they need to come to in your opinion, what do you think is right? Yes, I get it… No, they can’t be allowed to think. You have to tell them what they’re supposed to feel. No discussion. And even if there is some discussion, it’s there so that they can come to the idea that you have pre-planned. That’s hard. But it’s pretty much what I expected. I mean it’s a regular school. It’s a bit dicey. I’m wondering how soon are they gonna kick me out? I’ll just tell them that there is no God, and that’s it. Be worthy of our school. Behave. I am talking to you, young people. Call those lads, please. - Don’t be afraid, come closer. What are you afraid of? - Excuse me, have you studied history? The events of 1242. The Battle of the Neva. Alexander Nevsky goes into battle with Khorugvi and wins in the name of God. You don’t know anything again. One must bow to the icon of the Mother of God four times. I see you there at the back, not listening to me. God knows what you are doing on your smartphones. People! Learn your prayers, at least the Our Lord prayer. I knew them all when I was your age. Are you staring at that scum again? Look closer at the word «gadget». In our language: got shit! You got shit. It is purely Russian in spirit. The devil walks amongst us. You shouldn't think... that he is somewhere far away. He is next to us. AIDS IS A MONSTER FIGHTING AIDS Choose your friends wisely! Want to die? Choose him! Lead a healthy lifestyle! Make good friends! DANGER!! Wash your hands more often! Say NO to AIDS! Anyone have any questions? - Arina does. - I don’t. Arina got it. Vanya, did you get it? - She didn’t get anything. Stop it. - She’s beating me up right here! Imagine there is a canyon between the two of you, and you cannot reach… - Fall! Look, you still don't have the table. It’s not like you are going to do it at home. You need to look here, remember this, draw the table. Then the natural gasses. - I’m not going to draw it. You won’t make me until I want to myself. - Then start wanting. - Vanya, asshole! He shot my ear. - How did she get across the canyon? Roman! What is going on? - Nastya shot a rubber band! - You are all shooting rubber bands! Nikita, open your notebook. Open your notebooks, all of you. A rubber band just flew past me from your direction. Are you all mad? What was that? Were you shooting at me? You do realize this is war, right? I’m fed up with him. He does nothing. At all. I get that he has a language barrier… - No, he doesn’t! I’m willing to tutor him extra, I’m saying «come after classes», and he is like «no, I live far away." - His father will come tomorrow. Their mom left them. - I see! Single fathers are often angry, and his father probably shouts at him. - I’ve not seen this father even once. He’s never taken part in raising his child. No idea, why the mother left. - She must have been fed up raising her child all by herself. - They have two children. - Even more so. Vlad! What is a metaphor? - It is a metaphor. - Nice one. An F for you. - I don’t remember. - Good for you. Who does remember? A metaphor is a comparative figure of speech. «The fire of a red rowan is burning» is a metaphor. A whole quarter is already gone, and the only result is your writing got worse. - On Sunday night I felt like I was dying. It was agonizing. I couldn’t come up with anything for even one lesson, didn’t even check their notebooks. I simply came and told them to do whatever and I’d look at it later. I’m always told... that a lesson should have at least four different activities. Something like that. Then I thought «God, everything I do is shit. Why do I need any of it?». You have no time to eat or sleep. - I haven’t eaten today. - I hardly eat at all. Sometimes I eat breakfast. - I have a solid one hour break on Mondays and Tuesdays, when I go buy something at Pyatyorochka, and then often go to the village and eat a roll or something. But really I just like it there. It’s all village and fields, an introvert’s paradise. You should try it. A few of my student groups have gone wild this week. No idea why. Maybe because of rubber bands. Even without them. - It may be a symptom. - There is just that thing, which I am completely fed up with. Therefore I want to make some changes starting next week, try out some strict rools. Students asked for it too. How can there be any mutual respect? - Great. We are working on your commanding voice. "All sit!" Careful, you might get sucked in. By the school, teaching. - Well, at the moment I find it rather off-putting. It’s like the Red Sea. You try to dive deeper, but it pushes you out. - Come on! Don’t give up! - I’m afraid I can’t go higher. - Don’t let your fear in, it’s all psychological. The higher the pitch the more difficult it will become. - I can feel how rigid my whole body is. - Why is that? - I don’t know. - Are you scared? - No, I’m tired. - Nikita, come here. - What did I do? - Nothing. Just come here. Can someone tell me the elements of romanticism. - I thought you wanted to tell me something! Can I sit down? - No, you’re going to write something in a moment. Can someone give me an element of romanticism. What is romanticism, Ira? - It’s romantic, there’s candles and no lights on. - No that’s something completely different. Wait, wait. - I don’t remember… some guy was sick with something… crap. We read it in school. - We read it in school. Some guy was sick. Does anyone know what Anton is talking about? - Oh, it’s that… What do they call him? - A romantic hero. Hello! Anton. - Yes? - A romantic hero is always in contrast with the surrounding society. Have any of you ever felt lonely? - No, my mom’s always home. - Yes… - I mean, sometimes… sometimes you feel like… you feel like you don’t have anyone to talk to… - Yes. Yes. - 24/7. The kids read very poorly, very little. I’m suggesting they just read some other literature, not following the school program, just to come and share what they’re interested in, but they say, “We’re not interested in anything, we don’t want to read!” Usually the kids can’t in a short time, in two minutes, come up with a cohesive text made up of 10 sentences. Or if they must answer a particular question. For example: "How do you celebrate holidays at home?" They say: "I don't know”. And reading is very important for this. But I can’t force them to read, right? I think, may be, I don’t know, maybe you should read together, exchange thoughts What did you read, what do you enjoy? What books did you read at their age, why did you like it back than... The love for reading is instilled at home. I don’t know, something like this, really — it’s important to somehow pass on your reading experience. If you read at home, you... but for now it’s all very difficult. That’s it. Yeah, that’s probably it… - Hi! - What is everybody drinking? - This is chacha. Grab a glass then. Good f-ing evening! - Happy New Year, babe! - It’s getting more and more languid! - The evening is languid no more! - It’s a birthday, birthdays shouldn’t be languid! - Birthdays are sad! - Why is Katya doing the cooking for her own birthday? - Everyone, except for me, is asleep. Mafia walks around the town. It goes past player no.1, player no 2, player no 3, player no 4, player no 5, player no 6, player no 7, 8, and 10. - I’m prepared to unite with player no.2; I will also support player no. 3. Perfect, say goodbye to player no.6. I think he is mafia for some reason. Player no.9 convinced me of it. I hate this paperwork. No amendments are allowed. Right, let’s go again. I do remember what I was doing. I haven’t gone mad, have I? Katya, have I gone mad? Let’s go dance a bit and then go home. Even my phone is being slow, never mind me. My hair is oily. The world is spinning around you. Let’s generalize a little. If we have few kids being born... in the region, how can we stimulate the birthrate. Let's listen to the minister of Social Politics of the Tula Region - First we have to build lots of cafes. The cafes will have a very romantic atmosphere. People will fall in love in the cafes, and they will start having more kids. - You’ll have lots of kids, but you’ll be in crisis, you won’t have enough money to build a house. - Kids need to be offered jobs. The kids will enjoy working. And this will be our excuse to use child labor. - Ah, so you want to lower the working age. How sweet! Do you want to go next? Okay, who will represent the republic of Dagestan? - We have employable teenagers who are lazy, they don’t do anything. We could build a factory — a sock factory, for example. They would make 30 ruble socks. I would save money and make a special field, we would gather the harvest and make bread. We would give a beautiful name to this bread, and it would be tasty, and we would sell it. - Well, large manufactorers decide… Okay, we'll say it in a different way. - That's it, that's it. Stop, stop. - Sasha, calm down. - I’m calm. - Sure you are. I can see you do this! - So what? I always do it! - You do it whenever you are nervous. - For a profit! The literature teacher gave us Fs for our patriotic upbringing. - They called Sasha’s parents. We got summoned to the principal’s office and so on. - The principal thought he saw me being inclined towards socialism. He said it’s cool, but there’s no way I can think like that... because I didn’t live under socialism. - There were communists… - You can’t blame everything on communists! - …In China, and now China has low wages! - Where do you have to work in order to be able to afford building... an automobile factory? - Take a loan. Baking bread - Where did factories come from then? - My dad’s a welder at a factory. I’m telling him «set up an enterprise, do something!» But they just sit at work waiting to get paid a lot. If there was this stupid socialism now… - Name one person who changed their life. - …there would have been no Musk, no SpaceX, no solar batteries and no solar shingle! - The market doesn't determine it, but… - It does! - Manufacturers do. - Elon Musk does it for the sake of humanity, of its development. Not so that he can earn more money for himself. He spends his earnings on his company. - Then why do his inventions belong to him and not to humanity, if he does it for the sake of humanity? - They do belong to humanity? - They get paid minuscule wages for their work! - They get normal wages. - Minimal! - They get paid minimum wages in China! - Everywhere! - No! - Yes! I’m telling you that a country must belong to the people. And that would be a good goal for humanity to strive towards. - Democracy. - You can’t call the current situation in capitalist countries democracy. - If everyone has power, then there is no power as such. - In the case of communism, the country belongs to the party. - To the people. - Party! - People! Communism allows no government! - Why are you so jumpy? - I’m furious! Communism has no such concept as a country. - socialism. - Socialism is a step… - It’s a utopia! - No. - We had agreed that all these political things wouldn’t affect our friendship, but so far it’s not really working. I found myself thinking that I don’t like preparing the lessons for you anymore. You’re never interested in what I show you, so now I don’t have any desire to do anything. I know you won’t be interested. We were discussing some grown-up topics, and Nikita... began sending porn site names, which jarred me a bit. I wanted to discuss why pornography is not good. Because it is all ugly. - Why? - What’s ugly? - Pornography distorts your idea of intimate relationships. It has nothing to do with... God, even talking about porn can’t get your attention! What do you find interesting? Lesbians are cooler than faggots! - Hey, shush! - It’s a fact! - Firstly, I have repeatedly asked you... not to use the word «faggot» in my classroom ever! - Homosexuals. - Homosexuals. About half of all animal species have lesbian and gay members. That’s a norm. Secondly, it was considered a norm prior.. to Christianity. It is actually a physiological norm - What about same-sex marriages? - Of course that’s good. I mean, what’s the difference? What’s the problem? - Yegor is breaking a chair! - Yegor is one of those homosexuals. I am Yegor. I am an AIDSie . - Vanechka, you are asking to get kicked out. - Why? I guessed right! What’s with the stigmatizing of people living with viruses? - Dunno. - Why do you think you can use it as an insult? - We’re not, we’re just joking around. I want to talk to you about how you calling each other AIDSies is wrong. - Let’s all go look at the display board. It says «no to AIDS». - … using official names of diseases… - We just love AIDS. We only want AIDS. - In fact, I have… I have…. - That one over there got treated for TB. - Listen, this is impossible. I am trying... - One second! - Unfortunately, we can't wait for you… - Annual grasses! - Yegor and Arina... Activate Captain Obvious. - Well, small rodents… And so… The assignment is as follows: read the paragraph, come up with questions and answers for it, and write them down. The more you can write the better. - I had no idea what we were doing today. - Quit it, you’re a smart student! Where is North? - Oh, wait, one sec… Yes! No, wait. Well, where Moscow is. - Exactly. Where Moscow is is North. So where is South? Right! East? Keep working! A little weak, my dears! Hello! I’m not sure… I’m shocked myself! Hey! Can I read it? - Of course! Go ahead. - Can we not chatter in this moment? Today, I see, your glance is especially sad And your arms, embracing your knees, especially thin. Listen: far, far away on the Lake of Chad Wanders a gentle giraffe. He is endowed with slender grace and bliss, And his hide adorned with a magical design. Which the moonlight alone, shattering and rocking On the wide wet of the lake, dares to rival. I could tell merry tales of mysterious lands Of a black maiden, a young chief's passion But you have too long inhaled the heavy mist, You will believe in nothing but the rain. And how can I tell you about a tropical garden, Slender palms, the scent of inconceivable herbs... Are you crying? Listen... Far off on the Lake of Chad wanders a gentle giraffe. What is this poem about? About a giraffe? The giraffe is the main character? Vlad! Why is the woman crying? Depression and grief, and it’s clear that she is in some sort of very sad state. She doesn’t believe that it will get better… And that it’s better somewhere else. An open patriotic military-athletic competition in memory of Zhukov. Everyone come. For now I’m registering volunteers. If there are no volunteers — it will become voluntary-compulsory. Assembly and disassembly of a machine gun! Good job! Vasily Sergeevich Kharitonov’s team! - What are the rules? - You assemble the machine gun… - I want to help, or it’s going to take a really long time… - Help. - Can I help? - I’ll do this at least! Where is the support? Hey, we’re done! Vasily Sergeevich, you sould dance! Dance, boys! Bitch! Fuck! - Ira - I’m not ready yet. - Vanya - Can I please not go first? - Everyone else is being shy so come on. - I’m shy too. Alright, let’s go around a second time. Yegor, are you prepared? - No. - Not at all? - Maybe I’m prepared, but a bit… - Got it, prepared in your heart. Varya? - I’ll try. “I still languish tormented by desires…” Hey! Quiet everyone. I still languish tormented by desires, I still long for you with my soul — And in a mist of reminiscence My spirit longs to fly to you. - Can you be louder? - No, shut up - you’ll hear better. - Oh she’s yelling! You dog! - Hey, hey, hey! I still languish tormented by desires, I still long for you with my soul — And in a mist of reminiscence I still catch your image… Your dear image, unforgettable, Is always before me everywhere Unreachable, unchangeable, Like a star in the night sky… - A star in the night sky. The emphasis is moved in order to preserve the rhythm. If you knew in your stubborn heart, How a thug can love, How he can be obedient. Stop laughing bitch, shut up! I would forget bars for eternity And would forego my poetry, Just to lightly touch your hand And your autumn colored hair. I would forever follow you To known or to strange places… I’ve starting singing about love for the first time. I renounce brawling for the first time. Another extra comma. What a desperation-filled essay! The nation which I see, it’s impossible to live there anymore. Every year the rules of live become more and more difficult, like in a game, and beating this stage of life becomes more difficult and more impossible. Impossible — impossible. In order for Russia… Russia is with a capital letter, hon. Oh! A young racist! She would make it so that Russia would have fewer people of different nationalities, so that they would leave to their countries. A young nationalist! Half my class are nationalists! - Vanya! - What? - Stop distracting the girls! - Who? The girls? I’m not distracting them, they’re doing it themselves. Alright friends. I want to tell you that people leave places... due to war, unemployment, natural disasters… Half of you wrote in your essay that your ideal nation is one without non-Russians. So you’re trying to say that your ideal nation... is one that is isolated, that doesn’t allow anyone in… - No, it’s just that there are good people, and there are those who… In my opinion there should just be fewer of them than Russians. - Why do they come here? Because they’re so excited to take jobs from dishwashers, janitors, and gardiners? - I don’t know. For them it’s lots of money. - But they get out of line. Seriously. - Well you know, our Russians aren’t as much assholes as them. I mean morally speaking. - But these are people, they are alive, they’re just like you and me. - So what? - They have feelings. Imagine you end up in this situation. - What situation? - And there are fewer Russians. - Where? - I mean here at least, there’s a majority… - Where’s the majority? - I don’t know how to say this. - Where do you see the majority? Look at the percentage composition of the class. - It’s just the class. We have a whole separate class for gypsies. Ask in school number 4, they don’t have a single gypsy. - So what? - So nothing. - The sample size of your statictics is very small. - You know they’re getting seriously insolent. They’re breaking Russian laws. - Are there no Russian people who break the law? - That’s different, they’re Russian! - So? - So it’s like they’re guests and they’re stirring shit. Is it normal that girls walk down the street and those darkies whistle at them, and stare at their asses, is that normal? - Well one time a Russian man slapped my ass on the subway. What difference is their nationality? Varya? - Well you know, most of the time it’s them who do things like that. - It’s an issue of gender relations and of upbringing. - They do whatever they want even though they’re not in their country. - There is no “them”! Each person is an individual, and can’t be reduced to anything but himself - There’s a crowd of them, those wogs! I mean non-Russians! Nikita, I repeat. Every person, every person is an individual, and can’t be reduced to anything but himself! Not to his nationality, or religion, or biological sex, or anything else. You must accept people just as they are. - I don’t accept them at all! - If you start generalising, it will simplify your way of thinking, which makes you feel proud of something that doesn’t belong to you. - I can’t sleep because they make noise! - The fact that you are Russian is not your achievement, you were born like this. It is stupid to be proud of it! It’s stupid to be proud of what was given to you. You should only be proud of what you have achieved yourself. - Why are you preaching? - What do you mean? Because I support people! I believe that every person... - Are you such a good one, right? I don’t know what you mean! What rules am I following here? Olya you had a lot of this in your essay too! Olya, please move, up there by Dima. - No! - Yes! Yes! Move right now. - I don’t want to. - I’m going to go get Kristina Alrbertovna. Because you’re not listening to me. I’m talking about important things! - Don’t touch me! - We’re not even talking about Russian right now. Move right now! - I won’t do it anymore. - There’s no “won’t do it anymore”! It doesn’t exist! - It does! - I’m going to fail you for the remainder of the quarter right now. - Oh yeah, for what? - For not listening to me. - Ekaterina Alexeevna, half the class isn’t listening to you. - Please move forward. - No. - Yes! Certificate of participation in the School Olympiad, “In the World of Law” by the All-Russian State University of Justice. To Aleksandr Gordeev. Congratulations. Sasha is going to St. Petersburg, he wrote an excellent essay on the topic “If I were president.” I also want to tell all the upperclassmen to be very careful with what you put online, not everything is okay — think with your head before you post. - Freedom of speech! - That’s not freedom, that’s demagogy. I understand that at a young age you have have all-or-nothing views, aspirations, your own conclusions. But they must not be unlawful. We wrote with chalk on the board, “Happy Un-Constitution Day,” we drew a flag, we drew a little book and it had “The dumbest book in the RF” written on it. That was in December, that was the most active peak of the Navalny campaign — not that we’re all like “Navalany!” But there are some things he says that really make sense, and Putin has seriously gone off the rails. Sorry, we’ll cut this part out right? It’s not that we hate the Constitution, we just... don’t really like the current regime and system. I get a message from Angelica Radislavovna, “Sasha, delete your bad pictures. Just delete it. Or there might be problems.” I got lectured by the vice-principal, by the principal. Elena Aleksandrova calls and says “You know, your son is out of his mind, we got a call from the FSB — he had anti-government obscenities on his page.” I would like you to imagine yourself in the year 1916. What choice did you make and what do you expect from our country in the future. - Did you serve in the war, on the front lines? - Don’t insult me, you trench rat. - You’re the rat! Who are you calling a rat? - You. - You! We’re gonna get you with the whole squadron… Come on, shoot. - I work on my farm. I toil away along with my kids. - Well then keep working. Why are you bothering others? - I wasn’t bothering anyone. - Why are you ordering them to leave or stay. - I’m not ordering. - Why are you getting angry, why are you making a fuss? I have the right to get angry. I saw there’s this paper: “The right to free speech”. - Kind sirs, do not fight that won’t solve anything. - Were you finally executed? - Yeah – head over there. - Hello, Elena Aleksandrovna. - What’s going on here? - We’re doing a role playing game. About the civil war. Trying to study history in a more playful context. - They’re not saying anything provocative are they? Because Gordeev’s already in trouble, just like you. Did someone allow this? - We’re not even discussing modern Russia. We’re discussing 1917. - You may be discussing 1917, but they might still say something... unflattering about Russia. And I’m the one who has to deal with it afterwards. - No, it’s nothing like that, honestly. - Don’t you have anything better to do? - Well we want to support the kids. - It would be better if you taught the kids. - I am teaching the kids. - You’re not teaching them the right things. I understand that this is the Western agenda again. - Of course not. - Why are you laughing Katya? - There’s no agenda, really. - We’ve had it up to here with you. One of you is doing one thing, the other something else, the third is expressing his views on the government… And then I have to answer to the FSB again, what did you do? - Tedious difficult work, which for some reason I have forced myself to do. I basically stuck myself to the army. - I think I’m enjoying it a bit more. I mean I understood from the beginning that working in a school is working on the battle front. But I go to school in a good mood. Honestly, I like it: now we’re going to do this, now this. It’s not that I get it, I get who the different kids are. Vanya and I have found some common ground, same thing with Nikita — we found a way to communicate. When we aregue for a bit he likes to say something like, "Are you a good fighter? And I also flatter and compliment them. I don’t think a lot of people do that. And I think they enjoy it. And if I do something successfully I like to say, “Wow! Awesome! Let’s all do that.” And if I fail, I say “I’ll say like Ken Kesey hero - at least I tried. But you can’t change anything, so let’s live like we lived.” - I don’t want this. I want to keep developing. I have my own life too. I don’t get anything for myself there. I’m just rotting alive. I don’t understand how all these women live there all this time. For 30 years. I need to collect myself and manage not to leave school right now! Hallelujah. Fuck. Yeahhhhh. That’s it, goodbye. Principal - I’m going to… oh, I wrote it kind of lopsided. - Read it over. - Statement. I ask to be removed from the position of teacher of Russian language and literature, effective March 23rd, 2018, of my own volition. I’m taking it… - I’m singing it right now. My writing was slanted. - Well Ekaterina Alexeevna, I hope there are no hard feelings… - Not at all. - You were just trying to find yourself, which means you’ll probably find yourself somewhere else. You are a smart, educated person, everything will work out. So take this to Natalia Ivanovna? Thanks. I’m in that kind of mood today. Hey, pay attention. Listen folks, we have three more classes together, including today. - Is it true that you’re leaving? - It is true that I am leaving. - I don’t really give a damn. - We’re seeing each other one of the last three times. That’s just what happened because I’m a really bad teacher… - Don’t care about it. School isn’t the future. You’ll go into the movies - Wait, so you won’t even finish teaching us? - Yes, that’s what happened, I’m sorry, Olya. - And you won’t be here for the fourth quarter? - I won’t be here for the fourth quarter. - We’re almost not mad at you. For leaving us. - I’m very sorry, trully. - And you’re going to work there? - I’m thinking about what to do next. - Let’s take a picture together. - Alright, I don’t mind. - Ekaterina Alexeevna, don’t leave. - Do you want a hug? Varya, I’ll always be in your heart, and you in mine. Really, you can always write to me. If you want to come to Moscow to go to a concert or something, I can always meet you… Oh Varya, what’s wrong, kitty? Little kitty is crying… - I can’t cry, my mascara will drip. - It’s okay, I’ll give you a napkin. - Aren’t you sad yourself? - About what? - You’re not sad to be leaving? - No. - Why? - Because an end is a new beginning, Nikita. Besides, since I’m no longer your teacher, I can be your friend. There’s lots of upsides. See how good it is. - So we may call you Katya? - Yes you may. You don’t owe anybody anything. You only owe things to yourselves. Really. You only owe yourselves, and you owe yourselves to be happy, you can always achieve anything. Because you’re great. Because I believe in you. Thank you so much for the time you have given me. Well, how are you doing? - Look it’s my nerves. - What? Your nerves? You’re anxious? Because I’m leaving? A little, sweetie? It’s okay… - I just couldn’t handle the lessons. Don’t worry. Vasily Sergeevich is staying. Vasily Sergeevich is planning to stay for a second year no matter what. - So don’t worry. - We're not. - The last hope of this school is Vasily Sergeevich. - Yes. Alright, good luck, good bye. I want my teacher to know that she has to be bit more strict. That her classes are awesome, that she is modern, smart, understanding, but I am in a bad mood today. I want my teacher to know that in second grade we locked a girl on the roof. That we have a boy, Andrei, who eats his boogers. That we run during recess. Teacher skill “What do I want…” “From life” “Equality” “No violence” “From school” “To impart humane values to them.” “To teach them to read” "To show them that they can do more" “To show them that the world is bigger.” "From school" - I’m not going to come with you, but we’ll also be outside during the 7th period. - Yay! - Why are you carrying that backpack around? - You will find out in a bit. - Hello, Vasily Sergeevich! - Hi! - Listen to the sound of silence, everyone. Give me your phones. Put all your books away, into your bags. Varya, we won’t start until you hide your book. - I’m scared. Does it count even if I don’t look? - I will take a point for any sort of communication, including gesturing. Nikita, want to lose a point? Varya, stop distracting others. I will gladly talk to you after the class. - Can you not answer my question? Wait, no! Why? - Varya! Stop shouting, you are making noise. - You know it all yourself, but you haven’t explained anything to us! And now you are giving us a test! - One minute left. I mean it! I cannot conduct a test under these conditions! - And I can’t write like that! - Varya, it concerns you primarily! - Exactly! - Varya! - Take another point from her! - Let’s all shout! I want to shout more than anyone! Oh my god! - Do you want to be a teacher or not? This is what you need to ask, not sniff around about who wants to fire you today. - I wouldn’t work if I didn’t want to. Moreover, I want to make a difference, so that children aim for self-education and so on. - Unfortunately, at this point it looks to me like you haven’t put in as much effort as you were expected to, hence we have what we have today. There’s a reason they say, “You can’t go against the system!” It’s big. - Redraw it roughly. - I am drawing. - the word “enough” in white chalk on the asphalt. - Wrong. - You are doing everything right, Nikita. You are so involved in the process, almost like you want to score an A today. - I do. If only you knew how much I do. - You got it. - I think this is it. - There, nice one! I’m glad you even found it yourself. Done. I am going to draw you a huge plus. - Will you be working here next year? - Listen. They said I won’t. - Are you sad? - I am, to be honest. I mean, I really did want to work with you, I made plans And then it turns out that I am resigning. Are you happy or like, whatever? - You were kind and let us go home sometimes. I guess it would’ve been better. - Any other benefits of my classes apart from me being kind and letting you go home? - Well, I did learn something. - Like what? - For example, to look up all these diagrams and write out definitions. - Yeah? That’s good if it’s true. - There. - There. - Yes? - There. You keep looking with cloudy eyes, Anticipating new paths and ways. The sad, parting last bell Soon will ring all over the hallways. There is no escaping from these moments, Everyone of us knows this feeling, Which means that more than just our school childhood Leaves us together with this parting bell. - No, not these. Just these lines and the last ones. - Take these out. Yes, all of it. - Victor Ivanovich! I suddenly felt like talking to you about one thing, if it’s okay with you, about my resignation. I just realized that despite me not doing so great as a geography teacher, I would really like to stay in the school. I made some plans, here. And I suddenly remembered that there is a primary school class of gypsy children that everyone is fed up with and that is just left on its own. - Let's think about it. - I am interested in the nation-related topics. - I understood your idea. - Let's think about it. - What was your main school event this year? - Me getting an F! - In Geography? - Geometry. - Geometry. - I got a C for geography. - And you? - Elena Alexandrovna entered the classroom holding her hand like this. - Like this? - Yes, but pointing down here. - Awesome. What else? - I was told I might not make it to senior year. I didn’t pass a couple of tests during military training, because I wasn’t there. But then I somehow got a grade for the military training. And the headmaster and Olga Markovna were like «Ah, the three of you might not make it to senior year». - Who is the three of you? - Me, Oleg and… - I see, so you three. It’s not the main event for you, but it is for Sasha. - What about Vasily Sergeevich? - I’m the one asking the questions here. I don’t know, need to think. I think that me working in the school is kind of the main event for me. - Okay. That’s it boys, we have to run. So again, take care. - Goodbye! - It was good to see all of you. Good luck. - Goodbye! Ring over the past and the present, Over everything I have and haven’t saved, Ring over my passing childhood, The sad parting last bell.
