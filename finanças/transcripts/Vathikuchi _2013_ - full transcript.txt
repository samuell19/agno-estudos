How long have we known each other? Tell me lsn't it for a long time? Whom did we do all this for? Because the garment factory owner in Chrompet asked us to After that I married your younger sister Bring me the egg Then sheer bravado you went inside...jail The hotelier in T. Nagar And the chap who owns a theater in Mount road They repeatedly called and gave me work You know that shop owner Kothal Rao...? He gave me a job It must have been one:30 p.m. I remember that day so well Sir, job done -Where is he? - In my car boot Take him with you to Pondicherry Keep him with you till the conference ends Take him with you to Pondicherry Keep him with you till the conference ends Somehow manage tonight Tomorrow I'll ensure you get the money Okay, sir Has anyone got any money?

That's why We are eating now After we finish eating we must pay that man But if we dig a knife into his neck... ...he'll be giving us money instead! This holds good for people all around us I thought he was like that too But he came back next month Who are you? Don't stand in front of the house Get lost Are you Vetri's man? Did you come to see our boss? What does Vetri want? - No, I came to see you - Me? Why? You took 10,000 rupees from me and I want it back -What? - Last month, Prince plaza Dude, when we went to Pondicherry last month, we swindled him, no? Why didn't you come sooner? Why so late? We spent your money In that one month's gap It was evident he went to the gym He must have eaten eggs raw And in the morning eaten chickpea soaked overnight Must have seen a lot of stunt films Yes! Because that is how he stood So? If you go to the gym and work out...will you become brave? A few pull ups can't make him be like us But he came again He got the shivers looking at us He couldn't even stand one blow He is a real dummy Dude! Look, he's back Ask him what he wants What's your problem? What on earth do you want? You come here to get beaten every month You keep turning up since we hit you in installments We'll make a full and final settlement I need to settle this with you, come down Get lost...go and do your job...go These guys are not really brave Now it's your turn Won't you listen to me? 'My face must've had the same expression that his had...' '...when he was threatened with the knife at the ATM' 'He must've thought I chickened out...true' 'He took me by surprise' 'In brawls, getting beaten up is as common as lashing out blows' 'But it affected my profession' 'All my henchmen went to fall at the mercy of random feet!' 'Will they keep quiet?' 'Benny was beaten up by an auto driver...' '...Benny panicked' ''Benny is useless'' they said 'Those who heard this will naturally think it as gospel' 'I was jobless for a year' So can I carry bags of dried shrimps in the harbor? You should have shown your beast side that day to him He wouldn't be alive today then You've thought it all through What will happen to your wife and kid, you've planned it all I'm out now, no? You take care of my younger sister I'll kill him, Benny Who cares about jail? He walks on the same road I do If I make up my mind he won't exist tomorrow But mustn't kill as soon as the thought strikes you They'll make me count bars! By ruining him I shouldn't be ruined I'll get a chance I'll kill him You'll be a witness How dare you! - Watch your tongue - Father...help - Maa, mother! -Where're you running? Ma, please stop Everybody's looking That's why I'm doing it How dare you run? - Father...! - I'll kill you - Ma, they're hitting her nonstop - Hitting whom? Leena Let them, her tongue wags too much it seems They just moved to this area And I'm already hearing stuff Let her get a few blows Ma, go ask them why We can't do all that It'll seem strange - If you don't go, I will - This boy...! Ma...why? Don't hit me Sister...don't hit a girl like this Why are you keeping quiet? Born under the zodiac Gemini she's destined to be hit today So let her face it Why are you hitting her like this? I picked out such a nice name for her By the grace of God I called her Meena But she calls herself Leena I ignored it thinking she wanted her name to sound stylish Now she says she wants to become a Christian If her conservative grandparents who are devout Hindus hear this... ...how will they react? Won't they say she converted due to lack of money at home? I'll break your leg Hey Leena! Why your mother attacking you? I think no knowledge my mother Are you saying I have no brains? Let her go - lsn't that the guy? -Yes, that's him See how carefree he is! How much money he made us waste Humiliating! Going to court, cops, media, lawyers How much money we'd have spent! How will he understand the value of money? He'll keep driving an auto till he dies I wanted to tell you this There's an accused named Benny in Pallavaram Rowdy He bloodies his hands and dabbles in all illegal matters for many of us He and this auto driver are at loggerheads Benny wants to kill this auto driver He came to our club to ask Kothal Rao for money I was also there Kothal Rao didn't give him money He also left the place Rao is our good friend, no? So I told him, 'don't give money, just agree to handle his case' 'Let him kill whomever he wants' I've planted this idea in Rao's head Why are you silent? - What do you want me to say? - Not you, granny Are you irritated? Your mother took me aside and said... ...'My son is good and intelligent' 'He reads 4 papers a day' 'It's sad that we weren't able to make him study' And said 'You are a very lucky girl' Your sister's calling me sister-in-law so fondly What did you tell them? I didn't tell them that you loved me I told them I loved you - Okay...so why do you love me? - Because you are truly beautiful But won't I expect the same? As if you're handsome! I like academics So do you, no? My friend's here Slow the auto down - Hi, Vijaylakshmi - Hi Leena - How are you? - I'm fine! How are you? I'm fine! Okay, bye -Take care - Bye!

Going to school? Give my regards to your wife How can that be? No one will stand in the middle of a busy road...and discuss where to murder I heard it properly, pa He even said 9:15 a.m Venue is below the bridge It's not like the place he got mugged was empty either There were 100 shops It was broad daylight If something had happened to him that day, could we have taken it? Poor guy...I wonder who's kid they are planning to kill Whoever it is, will have a mother like me, no? She'll be hurt most 'What happened to me will be happening to someone else now' 'But in a worse way What can I do about it?' Did your father send any message? No, I wanted to talk to you Tomorrow at 9:15 a.m they're murdering a man, sir -Who? - I don't know - Kill whom? - I don't know But they've planned it for 6 months As if it's done impulsively? That's how all murders happen...preplanned! You've learned about it earlier, that's all -We shouldn't let it happen, sir - How can we prevent it? You said I should not have beaten up Benny but come to you instead - That was for you - Treat this the same way Look here, son There are million formalities when a real murder is committed My higher officials will torture me You are saying it's going to happen! That's it I can't work here Then leave it Why are you in this job? Get out of here Drive your auto 'Always, when it happens to you, it's an ordeal' 'When it happens to someone else, it's entertainment' 'No one really cared about it And there was a valid reason' 'And that was fair enough in a way But I wasn't able to do the same' 'It kept haunting me, over and over again' 'I saw him the next day again' 'I was pretty sure they'd kill him the next day underthe bridge' 'But no one knew this' 'Why...even the victim didn't know I was the only one who knew' 'How could I sleep? I stayed up all night' 'I only had 2 choices one was to ignore it' 'And no one will question me But I couldn't do that' 'At day break, I stood on the Velachery over bridge' one tea Can you please mend my slipper? - I can't do it now - Little urgent, office hour, man What can I do? I'll give you ten bucks Please oblige - I can't...go away - How helpful is that! - Tell me - Has he started? He'll be there in 1/2 hour, be ready Don't switch off your phone Don't attend any other calls You are smoking in this place with so many people here What 'sorry'? Don't you have any sense?! I stubbed it, okay? But why did you puff away in the first place here? I stubbed it, no? Watch your tongue Measure your words. Smoke suffocates me and I shouldn't ask, huh? Why are you coming to his rescue? You go and do your cobbler's job You'll hit a man in public and expect me to keep mending shoes?! - Okay, then ask me why - That's what I did just now - Daddy...what happened? - No idea I'll call the police If I hadn't picked up a fight, they'd have killed you within minutes How long has he been working for you? 5 months They've been planning to kill you for the past 6 months I don't know the reasons You figure it out yourself You call the police! 'There are 2 financiers in Sowcarpet Gangariya and his son Kolicha' 'They resent paying income tax' 'They bribed all the Income tax officers' 'But they struck a blank wall against Moideen sir!' 'So in the end, they decided to kill him' 'I put a spanner in their works most unexpectedly' 'My father's favorite words...' ''Helping an anonymous person and being helped by a random stranger...'' ''...are the most joyous deeds in this world'' 'I experienced that joy for the first time' 'How do they have the heart to kill such human beings!?' Okay...so the girl in that car came and spoke to you In the jeans and the t-shirt Am I right? Yes Why did you ask me to not take it the wrong way? And gave me such a build-up?! You already think of me as illiterate and unrefined If you knew I was into fighting, you'd get scared and tag me as a rowdy, no? Me? Scared? Of you and fighting? Yes Can I tell you something? Go ahead Please don't tell anyone else the way you spun this tale to me You don't know how to lie Your face gives it all away It seems he stood in a tea shop to see me...! There he overheard some yellow shirt stranger say he was killing someone He got all flustered and told the cops, his family, friends and... ...finally he himself rescued the man it seems! Does this sound like a believable story? Do you even know how to lie? No Look into my eyes Can you believe I've lied? But I have Once, all of us from English class bunked and went to the beach Me, Sivakami, Koperundevi Shanmugasundari...we had fun Entire beach was looking at us We ate corn on the cob, dried our dupattas... ...and got ready to leave And that's when I saw my aunt, uncle and cousins They yelled out my name loudly What would you've done if you were in my shoes? - Tell me - I don't know You'd have turned around immediately ...or scooted from that place But I walked away casually I got into the bus and went home When I reached home, they'd have told her, no? My mother asked me ''where did you go''? I said I went for my English class She looked at my feet It seems I'd have sand on my feet I was too smart for that, right My father asked me to swear on his life I hesitated for a minute I looked at my father And then at his head First my father Then his head I smacked him in the middle of his head I stuck to my story Then my mother said ''your sister will be dying to blame my daughter'' ''As if I've brought her up so badly!'' That is how you should lie! You are hopeless at it If all that you said were true... ...would you be able to roam freely behind a girl? - They'd have killed you -Yes...yes ''Know thyself'' ''Trust in your talent'' ''Believe in your best'' ''Man's deeds burn up in a blaze His guises catch up in many ways'' ''Man's actions in flames burn down His guises come a full circle around'' ''Unseen evil presence hounds us with a vengeance'' ''Hunts us night and day Makes a dramatic display'' ''Times are tough to trust our own self'' ''Treachery and deceit exist without limit'' ''Rely on your resourcefulness'' ''Have faith in your prowess'' ''Don't doubt what you can do'' ''If push comes to shove your best bet is...you!'' If we hire a man to kill Shakthi... ...we'll get caught when he gets caught Only one way out There was a news report about 2 murders in Kanyakumari The police are hunting for Gunaseelan for past one month He is hiding safely in an apartment He parties at night Sleeps during the day I've been visiting this apartment There's a gun hidden behind the God's picture For one week In the same spot We can flick it We can shoot Shakthi in his auto within 10 feet distance We can return the gun back What do you say? Someone was hassling one of our partners I tried talking to him- Come in Greetings, bro -Why didn't you come yesterday? - I was tied up, bro My friend Karuvelamuthu He is into marketing Didn't Durai tell you? They get loans from banks passing fake jewelry as genuine Gunaseelan bro Continue your story What? He was telling us about his escapades - Forget that - Tell me, bro Those days if we needed to hit someone, we'll take him to the seaside We were 3 of us We beat him to a pulp He was lying horizontal on the waters... with imprints of our thrashing, shirt torn and soaked in blood We were drinking tender coconut water I looked down He was staring at me I asked if he wanted a drink He too nodded his head I gave him tender coconut water He raised his head and drank The tender coconut water instead of going down his throat... somehow hit my eye I slashed him, one neat blow with my sickle Right into his Adam's apple His head severed from the body From then on I got a tremendous fan following Son of a wretch! Play that CD ''Golden moon my dearest My dream nestled in your crescent'' Pour him a few more pegs Wash it down ''Thunder applauds my song No picket fence to hinder along'' ''Wild tempestuous jungle Sing while into me you snuggle'' ''Looking at you and at the ground glistens like gold, shimmering around'' ''My dear birdie, my mate Cuddle up to me, satiate'' Chay! Can't find the gun Did you check properly? - I did - Search in that room ''Play the bull taming sport With an apt ally wrestle and cavort'' ''Today is unlike yesterday Tomorrow is not like today'' ''Today is unlike yesterday Tomorrow is not like today'' Only you go I'll stay here Let one of them wake up in the morning Then I'll leave If he asks for me, tell him I got an urgent call, I left Vanu, don't hold the gun in your hand Put it in our hideout and go home That auto guy should NOT be alive tomorrow 'The number you are calling is switched off now' Karuvelamuthu Hey! Karuvelam Why are you sitting here like this? Karuvelamuthu What happened? Hey! Who hit you? Say something I'll know only if you tell me Where have you hidden the gun? Tell me...where the gun is Gun? Which gun? I don't even know what you are talking about You don't know? Oh god...! Don't die Give it back to me I don't understand Why would I take a gun? You won't tell? Oh god...! We didn't take the gun He got a call, he rushed I was drunk, I couldn't go So I stayed behind Hello...tell me? Nachiappan, what happened? These 2 boys don't seem to have taken it Call that George boy He's been asking for money for the last couple of days I refused So maybe he took my gun to sell it Okay, Gunaseela I'll catch hold of George I'll tap his head hard enough for him to cough up the gun Don't be tensed I'll deal with it Hey! Let him go Where did you get the gun from? It's been here all along? That means you took it Listen, this is Gunaseelan's gun I'll talk to him about it You leave now I'm really mad with you right now Shakthi - Tell me - Why do you do this to me? What? I couldn't sleep all night I kept tossing and turning I woke up at 5:00 a.m Even though my mother tried to wake me up... ...I got out of bed only at 8:30 I felt like talking to you But I controlled my urge My hands were itching to dial your number I thought I shouldn't But I did...okay Where are you now? At home I feel like seeing you - Come quickly - Okay, okay Keep that aside Stand here Why do you need my blessing now? Drive carefully Okay, you spoke your heart out You called me And I'm here now Come Sit down Why are you torturing me like this? I haven't been this way before, you know? This is not me at all I was thinking 'oh this boy is crazy about me' 'But if I finish studying, they'll find me a groom...' '...with an office job and get me married to him' Then what'll happen to you? I can't even sleep properly I think you've fallen too much for me You are flying high in the sky If you fall down you are finished I'm only flying, no? I don't mind falling It's easy to say all this But very difficult You won't be able to handle it, when it happens I don't think you've understood love completely You know my friend Sivakami? Her cousin loved a girl For 4 years, sincerely Then she got married to someone her parents chose You know that tall building next to LlC in Mount road? This boy jumped off that building And then my friend Devi...a boy was in love with her for 3 years She loved him too But she dumped him because he was an alcoholic So he jumped in front of an electric train in Chrompet You understand why I'm saying all this, right? I know You slowly try to get me out of your system I'll talk to you and we'll stay the same way we are now Doesn't that auto look familiar? Yes There's a girl sitting inside That must be Leena Hold this, I'll be back Hey Leena Come here Gosh! My mother You stay right here Don't get out What are you doing here? They told me they saw you at the beach and park I turned a deaf ear I believe them now Mother, don't beat around the bush Ask me straight to my face He's the one who's in love with me I'm not in love with him Why? -What do you mean 'why'? -Why don't you love him? I can't get married to an auto driver Though your father works in a Govt. office... ...the money lender grabs a huge chunk monthly He is sozzled every evening This boy doesn't have any bad habits He even owns an auto What else do you want? Mother, don't brainwash me I'll tell my father you said this about him So you'll never fall in love with him? Yes So you shouldn't one day placate and plead with me... ...to support your love and break the news to your father - I won't do that - Sure? Confirmed -What did your mother say? -What did she say? She yelled at me She doesn't like me talking to you as it is And now she saw us together She said she'll break my legs when I get home It's all because of you - Sorry, Leena -What do you mean 'sorry'? Don't ever look at me again...go ''Am I a baby to get terrified if you widen your eyes wild?'' ''Are you a parakeet to repeatedly spear me with words heatedly?'' ''You try to intimidate me with your tricks willy nilly'' ''You try to brainwash me with your words full of honey'' ''I'll have the last laugh after I make you my equal haIf!'' ''Am I a child to get petrified if you roll your eyes owl-wide?'' ''Are you a parrot to constantly dissect me with words so deadly?'' ''I'll ease your pain with kisses 1000 I'll show your life in a nano second'' ''With French kisses I'll savor your flavor With spiky lashes I'll graze you all over'' ''I'll make you mine in a split second I'll caress the fiery rain and sun frosted'' ''Tresses tremble wet Moustache in beads of sweat'' ''Am I a kid to feel threatened if saucer-eyed you beckoned?'' ''Are you a parakeet to frequently chop me with words eloquently?'' ''Both seas merge as one to swell Nailsscrawl their address as well'' ''Closed eyes flare with an intense stare'' ''In my angel's breath is heard gasp and groan love-spurred'' ''Moon yonder, I'm sea here I try to gush to you my dear'' ''When clothes (st)rip my soul I slowly lose control'' ''Eyelids relax Lips drawtracks'' ''Am I a child to get mortified if you rotate your eyes nationwide?'' ''Are you a parrot to recklessly torpedo me with words rapidly?'' Hey Vanu! What are you doing here? He went inside Dude, this is Praveen's area Housing board If he is inside, he has to come out this way There's no other way Everyone knows us here We must be discreet Keep the gun inside at all times -What is it, son? - I'm visiting my friend 'That day I testified for income tax officer Moideen' 'And against the financiers Gangariya and Kolicha in court' 'Afterthat, I've been in various little fights' 'Supporting an old banana vendor, an elderly teacher, mechanic' 'The local police station even has a few cases against me' 'How could I act helpless when I really wasn't?' 'But in that situation, I was really happy' 'I didn't think this would happen then' 'My neighbor, the guy who smiled at me everyday and waved at me...' '...Vanaraj was now suddenly brandishing a gun at me' 'I don't have any problem with him' 'No fights, no enmity' 'I've never crossed swords with him' 'Why does he want to kill me?' 'We'll definitely kill Shakthi today His death is his own fault, not ours' 'A month earlier' His name is Dakshinamurthy He started a company with his friend Middle class Started earning well He has a 4 year old kid Tablets, injections, allopathic medicine won't work on that kid He's allergic to them His body will break into boils That's why Dakshinamurthy loves his son excessively Next month he's getting a big sum of money Nearly 90 lakhs We will kidnap his 4 year old Hold him hostage for one day And we'll send only one message to Dakshinamurthy ...demanding 60 lakhs if he wants his son back alive Everyone will be terrified that the boy will die And Dakshinamurthy will concede to our demands Each of us gets 20 lakhs and we'll all be settled - Won't he go to the police? - He's not that kind How is he getting this money? He and his friend sweated it out for 10 years But he came out over a small dispute This amount is his compensation Such an emotional type Middle class mind His kid is more important to him than money No need, dude We see stuff like this in the news all the time If we get caught we are done for! We only see stuff about people who got caught Are only so many crimes happening in the city? Do you know how many unsolved crime reports are piled up in a police station? So many crimes are committed without complaints being registered Where are all those offenders? Going about their lives around us It's only bad when it's purely physical When it's well planned out, it's called 'being a genius' We'll doubt ourselves Ask 1000s of questions But after it's done we shouldn't be traced - That's enough -What do you want us to do? This is Dakshinamurthy's house That's his kid We'll kidnap him 25 days from today Where will we hide him for a whole day? Avenue no one should know Somewhere not easily traceable What's the best hide-out? What about General Hospital? It'll always be crowded No one will care even if he screams and yells Or even if he dies they'll ignore and walk away If we give him a little tablet right here, that's enough He'll swell up and pass out If someone's crying next to him ourjob will be even easier That's super Only 20 days left 2 questions Where is the venue for 'Operation kidnap'? How do we get the ransom money? Definitely when his mother is with him Only then it'll have the desired deep impact And Dakshinamurthy will react Looks like he is dead It's a police case Hospital is close by Let's lift him up Open the door Only one day left - Let's not take this boy -Why this change of plan? If we take him, we might get caught by the auto driver Simple...we won't kidnap when he's in the auto He is my neighbor I know how his mind works When Rs 10,000 got stolen from him he found the guy and beat him up Someone was planning to kill someone else He overheard this in a tea shop and stopped it! Dakshinamurthy has saved his life Do you think he'll keep quiet if anything happens to that kid? You were the one who dangled a carrot?! That's why I resigned my job I'm getting married I've even paid advance Our lives will be ruined, if we get caught, is that okay? Then let's pick someone else We can't just kidnap anybody Dakshinamurthy was ideal because we knew everything about him How many can we find like him? It's easier to murder Kidnapping is more risky Then let's kill That auto guy Then we'll take the kid How will he stop us then? He can't...right? Dude, you said these famous words! Little courage Lots of thought put into it We should suspect ourselves Even ask million questions But once we kill, shouldn't leave even one clue behind Yes, let's do it Chance of a lifetime It's 15 lakhs each - Let's not change our mind - Okay, let's do it Where is he? Near the housing board Somewhere here -Who are you? - I came to see a friend Go...don't hover around That's him! Hello boss! Aren't you Sukumar? Siva told me you'd come His mother isn't well He's taken her to the clinic He asked you to wait upstairs He has given me the house key Aren't you the electrician? -Yes - Come and sit inside Sit down Switch on the fan - Hey? -What? I locked him inside -Who's house? - Praveen's house - His mother...? - They've gone to Thirupathi - They'll be back only after 2 days - Holy crap! His chapter is closed 'They are 6 of them' 'They are intent on killing me' 'They are armed' 'I can outwit them' 'I'm not too sure about handling their guns...' 'I shouldn't panic now I'll lose my strength if I do' 'I can shout' 'But my screams may swing in theirfavor or mine' 'Let me think calmly' 'I should know not only their words and actions' '...but their thoughts too' Where is Subramani? He's gone to get the car to transport the corpse Okay...call him Ask him to come here Hey, we have to wait till the area quietens and everyone is asleep That's true but we must do it when people are still around Only then we have our alibi If we are the only people around we will arouse suspicion When it is dead calm a small noise from us... ...we'll be caught in our own trap Before this shop closes down... ...before the lights are down we should kill him Call Subramani ''In the coconut grove with swaying trees I plucked the coconut with elan and ease'' ''We seek Your graciousness our dear compassionate Goddess'' ''Accept ourtender coconut offering Listen to our woes; our pitiful suffering'' ''Grace us Goddess with Your gracious blessing'' Leena...? Shakthi speaking I've told you repeatedly not to call me late at night This is why I didn't want to take a phone from you Cut the call I am in a mess Don't hang up Will you disconnect by yourself or shall I? Just listen to me 5 minutes please Okay My mother will be waiting up for me without eating her dinner She shouldn't know about me being in this tight spot Just tell her I won't be back tonight I am working late What's your tight spot? You won't understand if I tell you Will you tell me or not? There are 4 to 5 people waiting to kill me Why do you do this? When I yelled at you tonight... ...I knew you'd come up with some sob story like this You must have got drunk Nothing of that sort Not only getting drunk... ...I'll even tell you where and with whom! Some terrace of a friend's house 5 or 6 of you 2 or 3 bottles must be empty by now Chap next to you must be smelling your head trying his best not to puke! Correct? Inform my mother - I can't do that -Why? lsn't it Friday? We are in Velachery My grandma's house Okay, fine - Hey... - Hmmmm... Sweet dreams! ''Mariamma of Kannapuram, dear Goddess Bless us with your divine auspiciousness'' ''Mariamma of Kannapuram, dear Goddess Bless us with your divine auspiciousness'' What happened? There's no sound His sound has been silenced Dayala, don't go...wait Only your corpse will leave this place! - Subramani...? - Tell me Switch on all the lights Why are you trying to kill me? Tell me Let me tell you Satisfied? Didn't you say you intended killing him? You will die That's why I said so Then we'll kidnap Dakshinamurthy's son You won't come You won't be able to Your family will be hunting for you I'll also join them in their search We've already killed one fellow I'm sure you know Just hit him I am dying of pain Save me Dayala, shut up If you shout we'll get caught Save me It is risky Let's take him out 'They want to kill me' 'But they don't want to be caught' 'They can't do that' 'I feel I can handle their guns now' - What happened? - Electric shock, bro Why couldn't you get an electrician? Why do you never listen? What's happening here? Friends are just having a good time What a stupid answer Open the doorfirst What now? You got drunk whole night?! Praveen, open the door I'll complain to the association Buffalo! You have no sense? Get lost Your mother asked you to eat at home, why didn't you come? I had work, sis-in-law! What work?! Your brother is yelling at me...let's eat You go...I'll be right behind Lets wait for him to reach the main road You planned well But you can't kidnap Dakshinamurthy's son here after Vanu, if we let him go we'll be in a royal soup! Look at these rowdies and their hooliganism He's holding a gun in his hands Look! The gun is right here Get down from the car You mongrel! Are you trying to trick me?! I knew you were up to some mischief one more blow Hit him What did you do to Nachiappan? Did you kill him? Answer me Did you finish him off? Answer me 'You are listening to Suryan FM 93.5' Drunk through every pore ''Man is a beast, roams in the street How best to tame him to retreat?'' ''He's a parasite in this fast world With what can he be eradicated?'' ''Weapon is a shield to pause Situations merely a cause'' ''Know your enemy's powers in the battle's headquarters'' ''Trust your instincts'' ''Believe in your best'' Yov! Stop Don't run I'll shoot you Come back and sit there You know that auto driver who testified in our case He has fallen unconscious in Velachery road I saw someone dragging him away He might kill him Is he our man? No, sir Auto driver got caught (whisper) Then I'll take care Yes, sir You haven't visited our shop, do come, sir I was out of town regarding a case Koli talks often about you Bring your wife to the shop We've got fresh stock ofjewelry from Bombay Yes, sir He is not one of our boys But he should die, sir Then I'll take care I'm glad, sir Get up Come here Don't finish him off here Take him away from the city His body shouldn't be seen in this area Okay, sir ''Rely on your resources'' ''Have faith in your impulses'' ''Trust in yourtalent'' ''Believe in your best'' Sister, don't worry Your son will be fine He'll stand in front of you tomorrow morning for sure If you ask me she is to blame She encouraged him to poke his nose in other peoples' affairs This is the consequence you pay for interference! Get down Move...go inside I just know my son is in some danger I don't know what He hasn't even called me Maybe he hid it from me thinking I will panic Please somehow bring him back to me safe and sound I've always warned him not to interfere in others' business Helping others is as much an addiction as smoking or drinking It is difficult to come out of that I'll tell my boss 'Forget yourself but never forget your mother dear' Benny, if we leave him now someone else will kill him Then you'll lose that pleasure for all times! Let's kill him right now Then they'll put me behind bars for 7 years like they did to you I know how to handle him You watch over him I'll see Kothal Rao and be back Year ending I can't withdraw cash You keep showing up like a bad penny! I'll inform my lawyer He'll take care You 'take care' of him I'll be in for 4 months My family needs to be taken care of If you can spare something... Wait at the basement car park I'll send Murugesan Velachery Velachery Starting now Come soon Velachery Why are you sitting so quietly? Should a girl always be yelling? Can't she be quiet sometime? What did I say that you're getting so hyper?! Have you fought with that chap? Why do you ask? He'll keep hounding you every 10 minutes 'The number you are calling is switched off now' Did he come? Did you see him? I did - What did he say? - He waved to me All you both can do is wave hands Ma, why did you say that? Nothing Something's fishy Tell me, maaaa! Our previous landlady Rani's brother likes you it seems He wrote some exam and got a Govt. job They know you They came and asked your father You will get a Govt. employee husband just like you wanted Happy? Ma, I'm sure you are pulling a fast one! Tell me, ma No, I am serious, dear Both you and my father are uneducated That's why you stopped me from going to school as soon as I fell sick If I also marry an illiterate... ...my kids will share the same fate as me That's why I wanted a husband who is an office employee Shakthi truly loves me, ma He's a good chap We won't be like you both We'll be happy together, ma Give me your consent, ma Leena fall in love! Why give him this much importance? You could've killed him in any road? Only a fight can be covered up in a local police station A murder will go up to the commissioner's office Then the station will be targeted That's why immediately after a murder the police station should be informed If we don't disturb the police they won't disturb us Benny toes the line to perfection -Yes, Benny? -What's that auto driver up to? Dumb ass, shut himself inside the shop out of sheer fright! Bring him to Vellaikal malai Let go of me Bro...Benny...bro I didn't say a word about you, Benny Jain group asked me if I'll kill some girl I agreed I didn't do anything else Other than leaving you in the lurch I haven't maligned you to anyone Why would I interfere with your job, bro?

Give me a day, sir I'll surrender day after I've spoken to the Inspector He has asked you to come to a hotel in Alwarpet - Okay, sir - No problem But the paper won't report you surrendered in the court News will appear only 2 days later That they caught you Are you okay with it? If you say so, sir He has asked you to bury the body there They'll themselves dig it out, it seems Good evening, bro Don't dig too deep Only then the dog will be able to find it He gave us a run for our money Mahesh, tie his hands - Scared? -Why should I be? Hey! Bring the rope If you shut yourself in that shop...? It's such a battered shop with an old wooden door one blow will bring it down Are you that brainless? Did you think you could escape that way? Hey...hey...hey! There's no escape out Let him be inside 'Nothing untoward should happen to me' 'If I die, even my mother will think helping people only ends in death!'

For 2 days and a night they've chased him to kill him His love for eating fruits gave him enough strength to combat them That's why he is alive today He escaped from one chap and fainted It seems when he opened his eyes another chap hit him lmagine my brother's plight He escaped from him also Maybe it's because you also prayed for him I'll be back in a bit Your mother and sister believed all your tales?! What happened to you? You drank and then turned your auto upside down? Your family loves you so much And here you are obsessing about a girl lmagine if you had fallen for the wrong girl! You had a narrow escape because it is me This bad habit of mine from childhood...! I can't bear to see anyone suffering because of me I thought about it really hard If you are in such a state just because I yelled at you... ...what will you do if I'm not in your life? So I decided to reciprocate your love Hey!
