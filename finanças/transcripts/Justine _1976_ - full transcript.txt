Amen. Amen. This creature, innocent perhaps, is, however, treated like a criminal, whilst all about me all is prosperity. I who am soiled with crimes and horrors. Alas, Monsieur, I am a poor orphan not yet 14-years-old and I have already become familiar with every nuance of misfortune. I implore your commiseration, have pity upon me, I beseech you. The services of a child like yourself are of no great use in a household. You have neither the age nor the appearance for the kind of place you are seeking. You would be better advised in devoting yourself to giving men pleasure, to occupy yourself with discovering a man who may consent to take care of you. The virtue whereof you make such a conspicuous display is worthless in this world. In vain will you genuflect before its altars, its ridiculous incense will nourish you not at all. Here on this earth. Odious man, may the Heaven you have so grievously offended some day punish your execrable heartlessness as it merits to be. You are worthy neither of the riches you have put to such vile use, nor of the very air you breathe in a world you defile with your barbarities. Madame, have pity. Yes, yes pity. One need only have pity and one starves to death. Thank Desroches, for it is as a favor to her I intend to show you an instant's kindness. You must surely be aware how little you deserve it after your performance yesterday. Perform your duty, Sirrah. This wretch has stolen from me a diamond worth a thousand crowns, you will find it in her chamber or upon her person, the fact is certain. Between seven and eight the Conciergerie will catch fire, I have seen to it. There's no question about it, many people will be burned. It doesn't matter, Therese. The fate of others is nothing to us when our own lives are at stake. Well, we're going to escape from this place, of that you can be sure. Four men, my confederates, will join us, and I guarantee you you shall be free. There you are, Therese, free. You may now choose the sort of life you wish, but were I to have any advice to offer you, it would be to renounce the practice of virtue which, as you have noticed, is the courting of disaster. Therese, you're young and attractive, heed me, and in two years I'll have led you to a fortune. But don't suppose I'll guide you along the paths of virtue. When one wants to get on, my dear girl, one must stop at nothing. Decide, then, we have no security in this cottage, we've got to leave in a few hours. Oh Madame, I am greatly indebted to you, and am far from wishing to disown my obligation. You saved my life. In my view, 'tis frightful the thing was achieved through a crime and, believe me, had I been the one charged to commit it, I should have preferred a thousand deaths to the anguish of participating in it. I am aware of all the dangers I risk in trusting myself to the honest sentiments which will always remain in my heart, but whatever be the thorns of virtue, Madame, I prefer them unhesitatingly and always to the perilous favors which are crime's accompaniment. There are religious principles within me which, may it please Heaven, will never desert me. If Providence renders difficult my career in life, 'tis in order to compensate me in a better world. Those are absurd doctrines which will have you on the dung heap in no time, my girl. Believe me, forget God's justice, His future punishments and rewards, the lot of those platitudes will lead us nowhere but to death from starvation. O Therese, the callousness of the Rich legitimates the bad conduct of the Poor. Let them open their purse to our needs, let humaneness reign in their hearts and virtues will take place in ours. But as long as our misfortune, our patient endurance of it, our good faith, our abjection's serve only to double the weight of our chains, our crimes will be their doing, and we'll be fools indeed to abstain from them. When they can lessen your yoke wherewith their cruelty bears us down. Nature has caused us all to be equals born, Therese. If fate is pleased to upset the primary scheme of the general law, then it is up to us to correct its caprices and through our skill to repair the usurpations of the strongest. I love to hear these rich ones, these titled ones, these magistrates and these priests, I love to see them preach virtue to us. It is not very difficult to forswear theft when one has three or four times what one needs to live. It is not very necessary to plot murder when one is surrounded by adulators and thralls unto whom one's will is law, nor is it very hard to be temperate and sober when one has the most succulent dainties constantly within one's reach. They can well contrive to be sincere when there's never any apparent advantage in falsehood. But we, Therese, we whom the barbaric Providence you are mad enough to idolize, has condemned to slink in the dust of humiliation as doth the serpent in grass, we who are beheld with disdain only because we are poor, who are tyrannized because we are weak. We, who must quench our thirst with gall and who, wherever we go, tread on the thistle always, you would have us shun crime when its hand alone can open up unto us the door to life, maintain us in it, and is our only protection when our life is threatened. You would have it that, degraded and in perpetual abjection, while this class dominating has unto itself all the blessings of fortune, we reserve for ourselves naught but pain, beatings, suffering, nothing but want and tears, brandings and the gibbet. No, no, no, Therese, no. Either this Providence you reverence is made only for our scorn, or the world we see about us is not at all what Providence would have it. Become better acquainted with your Providence, my child, and be convinced that as soon as it places us in a situation where evil becomes necessary, and while at the same time it leaves us the possibility of doing it, this evil harmonizes quite as well with its decrees as does good, and Providence gains as much by the one as by the other. The state in which she has created us is equality. An instant. He who disturbs is no more guilty than he who seeks to re-establish the balance. Both act in accordance with received impulses, both have to obey those impulses and enjoy them. By God, here's an unhappy little one. What, you shudder before the obligation to serve four fine big boys one after another? Listen to me, my sway over these dear lads is sufficiently great for me to gain a reprieve for you on condition that you can prove yourself worthy. Alas, Madame, what must I do? Command me, I am ready. Join us, throw in your lot with us, commit the same deeds, without show of the least repugnance. Either that, or I cannot save you from the rest. I will go everywhere with you, Madame, everywhere, I promise. Shield me from the fury of these men and I shall never leave your side while I live. Children, this girl is one of the company, I'm taking her into it. I want you to do her no ill. Don't put her stomach off the m'tier during her first days in it. You see how useful her age and face can be to us. Let's employ them to our advantage rather than sacrifice them to our pleasures. Dear friend, the wasting of the seed destined to perpetuate the human species, is the only crime which can exist, such is the hypothesis. According to it, this seed is put in us for the sole purpose of reproduction, and if that were true I would grant you that diverting it is an offense. But once it is demonstrated that her situating this semen in our loins is by no means enough to warrant supposing that Nature's purpose is to have all of it employed for reproduction, what then does it matter, whether it be spilled in one place or in another? Does the man who diverts it perform a greater evil than Nature who does not employ all of it? Now, do not those natural losses, which we can imitate if we please, occur in an abundance of instances? Our very ability to provoke them, firstly, is an initial proof that they do not offend Nature in the slightest. Quite so. It would be contrary to all the equity and profound wisdom we everywhere recognize in her laws for them to permit what might affront her. Secondly, those losses occur a hundred hundred million times every day, and she instigates them herself. Nocturnal pollutions, the inutility of semen during the periods of woman's pregnancy, are they not authorized by her laws, enjoined by them, and do they not prove that, very little concerned for what may result from this liquid which we so foolishly attach a disproportionate value, she permits us its waste with the same indifference she herself causes it every day to be wasted. She tolerates reproduction, yes, but much is wanting to prove reproduction is one of her intentions, she lets us go ahead with our reproducing to be sure, but it being no more to her advantage than our abstaining therefrom, the choice we happen to make is as one to her. Why, Monsieur, do you oppose my flight? Because, Therese, we have got you. And the stronger is always the better reason. La Fontaine made the remark ages ago. All men are born isolated, envious, cruel and despotic, wishing to have everything and surrender nothing, incessantly struggling either to maintain their rights or achieve their ambition, the legislator comes up and says to them, Cease thus to fight. If each were to retreat a little, calm would be restored. I find no fault with the position implicit in the agreement, but I maintain that two species of individuals should not and cannot submit to it, ever. Those who feel they are the stronger have no need to give up anything in order to be happy, and those who find themselves the weaker also find themselves giving up infinitely more than what is assured them. However, society is only composed only of weak persons and strong. Well, if the pact must perforce displease both weak and strong, there is great cause to suppose that it will fail to suit society, and the previously existing state of warfare must seem infinitely preferable, since it permitted everyone the free exercise of his strength and his industry, whereof he would discover himself deprived by a society's unjust pact that takes too much from the one and never accords enough to the other. Hence, the truly intelligent person is he who, indifferent to the risk of renewing the state of war that existed prior to the agreement, lashes out in irrevocable violation of that agreement, violates it as much and often as he is able, full certain that what he will gain from these ruptures will always be more than what he would lose if he happens to be a member of the weaker class, for such he was when he respected the agreement. By breaking it he may become one of the stronger, and if the laws return him to the class from whence he wished to return, the worst that can befall him is the loss of his life, which is a misfortune infinitely less great than that of existing in wretchedness and opprobrium. Hence, there are two positions available to us. Either crime, which renders us happy, or the noose, which stops us from being unhappy. I ask if there can be any doubt, pretty Therese, and where will your little mind find an argument able to combat that one? Softly, my friends. It was not for the sake of their purses that I exhorted you not to spare those travelers, it was solely in the interests of our security. The law's to be blamed for these crimes, the fault's not ours. So long as thieves are hanged like murderers, thefts shall never be committed without assassination. The two misdeeds are punished equally. Why then abstain from the second when it may cover up the first? One must never appraise values save in terms of our own interest. And what makes you suppose, furthermore, that two hundred louis are not worth three killings? The cessation of the victims' existences is as nothing compared to the continuation of ours, not a mite does it matter to us whether any individual is alive or in the grave. Consequently, if one of the two cases involves what in the smallest way affects our welfare, we must, with perfect unremorse, settle the thing in our own favor. For in a completely indifferent matter we should, if we have any wits and are master of the situation, undoubtedly act so as to turn it to the profitable side, completely indifferent to whatever may befall our adversary. For there is no rational commensuration between what affects us and what affects others. The first touches us physically, the other only touches us morally, and moral feelings are made to deceive, none but physical sensations are authentic. Thus, not only do two hundred louis suffice for three killings, but even 30 centimes would have sufficed, for those 30 centimes would have procured for us a satisfaction which, although light, must necessarily affect us to a much more lively degree than would three men murdered, who are nothing to us, and by the wrongs done whom we are not in the least touched, no, not even scratched. Our organic feebleness, careless thinking, the accursed prejudices in which we were brought up, the vain terrors of religion and law, those are what hamper idiots and confound their criminal careers, those are what prevent them from arriving at greatness. Every strong and healthy individual, endowed with a fully active mind, who preferring himself to others, as he must, will know how to weigh their interests in the balance against his own, will laugh God and mankind to the devil, will mock at the law, fully aware that it is to himself that he must be faithful, by himself all must be judged, will sense that the vastest multitude of wrongs committed on others cannot offset the least pleasure lost to himself, nor be as important as his smallest enjoyment purchased by an unheard-of host of villainies. Joy pleases him, it is in him, it is his own, crime's effect touches him not, is exterior to him. Well, I ask you, what thinking man will not prefer what causes his delectation to what is alien to him? And who will not commit to those deeds whereof he experiences nothing unpleasant, in order to obtain what moves him most agreeably? Friend, you understand, don't you, that after having robbed you, we cannot leave you alive. Oh Monsieur, I beseech you not to present me the horrible spectacle, upon my reception into your band, of this poor man's death. Allow him to live, do not refuse this first request I ask of you. The name Monsieur has just given himself causes me to believe we are nearly related. Be not astonished, Monsieur, be not at all surprised to find a kinsman in these circumstances. I will explain it all to you. In the light of this, Monsieur, grant me the unlucky creature's life. I will show my gratitude for the favor by the completest devotion to all that will be able to serve your interests. You know upon what conditions I can accord you what you ask, Therese. You know what I demand from you. Ah, very well, Monsieur, I will do everything. Let him live. But he has got to join us, that last clause is crucial. I can do nothing if he refuses to comply with it, my comrades would be against me. Oh, Madame, I have no idea what that man afterward said or did. The state I was in when I returned to my senses advised me only too well to what point I had been his victim. It was darkest night when I awoke. I was at the foot of a tree, away from any road, injured, bleeding, dishonored. Such had been the reward for all I had just done for the unlucky man, and carrying infamy to its ultimate degree, the wretch, after having done to me all he had wished, after having abused me in every manner, even in that which most outrages Nature, had taken my purse containing the same money I had so generously offered him. He had torn my clothing, most of it lay in shreds and ribbons about me. I was virtually naked, and several parts of my body were lacerated, clawed. You may appreciate my situation. There in the depths of the night, without resources, without honor, without hope, exposed to every peril. I wished to put an end to my days. Had a weapon been presented to me, I would have laid hands on it and abridged this unhappy life, full only of plagues for me. The monster, what did I do to him, I asked myself, to have deserved such cruel treatment at his hands? I save his life, restore his fortune to him, he snatches away what is most dear to me. A savage beast would have been less cruel. O man, thus are you when you heed nothing but your passions. Tigers that dwell in the wildest jungles would quail before such ignominies. Monsieur. Your candor and naivete do not permit me to think you untruthful. I will inquire after no other information save what will authorize me to believe you are really the daughter of the man you indicate. As for the du Harpin affair, I will assume responsibility for settling it with two visits paid to the Chancellor. We have but to prove your innocence to him. All the charges leveled against you will crumble and be withdrawn. All religions start from a false premise, Therese. Each supposes as necessary the worship of a Creator, but that creator never existed. In this connection, put yourself in mind of the sound precepts of that certain Coeur-de-fer who, you told me, used to labor over your mind as I do. If all Nature's productions are the resultant effects of the laws whereof she is a captive, if her perpetual action and reaction suppose the motion necessary to her essence, what becomes of the sovereign master fools gratuitously give her? That is what your sagacious instructor said to you, dear girl. What, then, are religions if not the restraint wherewith the tyranny of the mightier sought to enslave the weaker? Motivated by that design, he dared say to him that a God had forged the irons with which cruelty manacled him, and the latter, bestialized by his misery, indistinctly believed everything the former wished. Can religions, born of these rogueries, merit respect? Is there one of them, Therese, which does not bear the stamp of imposture and stupidity? What do I descry in them all? Mysteries which cause reason to shudder, dogmas which outrage Nature, grotesque ceremonies which simply inspire derision and disgust. But if amongst them all there were one which most particularly deserves our scorn and hatred, O Therese, is it not that barbaric law of the Christianity into which both of us were born? Is there any more odious? One which so spurs both the heart and mind to revolt? How is it that rational men are still able to lend any credence to the obscure mutterings, to the alleged miracles of that appalling cult's vile originator? Has there ever existed a rowdy scoundrel more worthy of public indignation! What is he but a leprous Jew who, born of a slut and a soldier in the world's meanest stews, dared fob himself off for the spokesman of him who, they say, created the universe. With such lofty pretensions, you will have to admit, Therese, at least a few credentials are necessary. But what are those of this ridiculous Ambassador? What is he going to do to prove his mission? Is the earth's face going to be changed? Are the plagues which beset it going to be annihilated? Is the sun going to shine upon it by night as well as by day? Vices will soil it no more? Are we going to see happiness reign at last? Not at all. It is through hocus-pocus, antic capers, and puns that God's envoy announces himself to the world. It is in the elegant society of manual laborers, artisans, and streetwalkers that Heaven's minister comes to manifest his grandeur. It is by drunken carousing with these, bedding with those, that God's friend, God himself, comes to bend the toughened sinner to his laws. It is by inventing nothing for his farces but what can satisfy either his lewdness or his gourmand's guts that the knavish fellow demonstrates his mission. However all that may be, he makes his fortune, a few beef-witted satellites gravitate toward the villain, a sect is formed. This crowd's dogmas manage to seduce some Jews. Slaves of the Roman power, they joyfully embrace a religion which, ridding them of their shackles, makes them subject to none but a metaphysical tyranny. Their motives become evident, their indocility unveils itself, the seditious louts are arrested, their captain perishes, but of a death doubtless much too merciful for his species of crime, and through an unpardonable lapse of intelligence, this uncouth boor's disciples are allowed to disperse instead of being slaughtered cheek to jowl with their leader. Fanaticism gets minds in its grip, women shriek, fools scrape and scuffle, imbeciles believe, and lo! The most contemptible of beings, the most maladroit quacksalver, the clumsiest impostor ever to have made his entrance, there he is, behold, God, there's God's little boy, his papa's peer. And now all his dreams are consecrated, and now all his epigrams are become dogmas. And all his blunders mysteries. His fabulous father's breast opens to receive him and that Creator, once upon a time simple, of sudden becomes compound, triple, to humor his son, this lad so worthy of his greatness, but does that sacred God stick at that? No, surely not, his celestial might is going to bestow many another and greater favor. At the beck and call of a priest, of, that is to say, an odd fellow foul with lies, the great God is going to abase himself to the point of descending 10 or 12 million times every morning in a morsel of wheat paste. This the faithful devour and assimilate, and God Almighty is lugged to the bottom of their intestines where he is speedily transmuted into the vilest excrement, and all that for the satisfaction of the tender son, odious inventor of this monstrous impiety which had its beginnings in a cabaret supper. My hand! Have you been able, Monsieur, to conceive such projects? No, dispose of my life if you must, but imagine not you will ever obtain from me the horror you propose. Hear me, Therese. I indeed foresaw your distaste for the idea, but, as you have wit and verve, I flattered myself with the belief I could vanquish your feelings could prove to you that this crime, which seems to you of such enormity, is, at bottom, a very banal affair. Two misdeeds present themselves to your not very philosophic scrutiny. The destruction of a creature bearing a resemblance to us, and the evil with which this crime is augmented when the said creature is one of our near kinsmen. With regard to the crime of destroying one's fellow, be persuaded, dear girl, it is purely hallucinatory. Man has not been accorded the power to destroy, he has at best the capacity to alter forms, but lacks that required to annihilate them. Well, every form is of equal worth in Nature's view, nothing is lost in the immense melting pot where variations are wrought. All the material masses which fall into it spring incessantly forth in other shapes, and whatsoever be our interventions in this process, not one of them, needless to say, outrages her, not one is capable of offending her. Our depredations revive her power, they stimulate her energy, but not one attenuates her, she is neither impeded nor thwarted by any. Why, what difference does it make to her creative hand if this mass of flesh today wearing the conformation of a bipedal individual is reproduced tomorrow in the guise of a handful of centipedes? Dare one say that the construction of this two-legged animal costs her any more than that of an earthworm, and that she should take a greater interest in the one than in the other? If then the degree of attachment, or rather of indifference, is the same, what can it be to her if, by one man's sword, another man is transspeciated into a fly or a blade of grass? When they will have convinced me of the sublimity of our species, when they will have demonstrated to me that it is really so important to Nature, that her laws are necessarily violated by this transmutation, then I will be able to believe that murder is a crime, but when the most thoughtful and sober study has proven to me that everything that vegetates upon this globe is of equal value in her eyes, I shall never concede that the alteration of one of these creatures into a thousand others can in any sense upset her intentions or sort ill with her desires. I say to myself, all men, all animals, all plants growing, feeding, destroying and reproducing themselves by the same means, never undergoing a real death, but a simple variation in what modifies them all, I say, appearing today in one form and several years or hours later in another, all may, at the will of the being who wishes to move them, change a thousand thousand times in a single day, without one of Nature's directives being affected for one instant. What do I say? Without this transmuter having done anything but good, since, by dismantling the individuals whose basic components again become necessary to Nature, he does naught by this action, improperly qualified as criminal, but render her the creative energy of which she is necessarily deprived by him who, through brutish indifference, dares not undertake any shuffling, as it were, of the pack. O Therese, it is man's pride alone erects murder as a crime. This vain creature, imagining himself to be the most sublime of the globe's inhabitants, its most essential, takes his departure from this false premise in order to affirm that the deed which results in his undoing can be nothing but an infamy, but his vanity, his lunacy alter the laws of Nature not one jot. No person exists who in the depths of his heart does not feel the most vehement desire to be rid of those by whom he is hampered, troubled, or whose death will be of some advantage to him. And do you suppose that the difference between this desire and its effect is very great? Now, if these impressions come to us from Nature, can it be presumed they irritate her? Would she inspire in us what cause her downfall? Ah, be at ease. Dear girl, we experience nothing that does not serve her. All the impulses she puts in us are the agents of her decrees. Man's passions are but the means she employs to attain her ends. If she stands in need of more individuals, she inspires lust in us and behold there are creations. When destructions become necessary to her, she inspires vengeance, avarice, lechery, ambition into our hearts and lo! You have murders. But she has not ceased to labor in her own behalf, and whatever we do, there can be no question of it, we are the unthinking instruments of her caprices. But my aunt is the creature I am going to destroy. Oh, Therese, in a philosopher's view how frivolous are these consanguinary ties. Forgive me, but I do not even wish to discuss them, so futile are they. These contemptible chains, the fruit of our laws and our political institutions can they mean anything to Nature? Desert your prejudices, Therese. Leave them behind, and serve me. Your fortune is made. Oh Monsieur, your mind invents this theory of an impassive, indifferent Nature. Deign rather to heed your heart, and you will hear it condemn all libertinage's false reasonings. I see very well I was mistaken, Therese. I regret it, perhaps as much on your account as on my own. No matter, I shall discover other means, and it will be much you shall have lost without your mistress gaining anything. You are delicious, my child. A gleam of wisdom seems to have penetrated into your mind. That such charming mind as this should have lain in darkness for so long. Incredible. You are the first woman I have ever held in my arms, and truly, it is with my soul. But the abominable crime was to be consummated, some inconceivable permission must have been granted by Heaven that virtue might be made to yield to villainy's oppressions. The animal upon which we had experimented revealed everything to the Count. He heard it howling, knowing of his aunt's fondness for the beast, he asked what had been done to it. Those to whom he spoke knew nothing of the matter and made him no clear answer. From this moment, his suspicions began to take shape, he uttered not a word, but I saw that he was disquieted. I mentioned his state to the Marquise, she became further upset, but could think of nothing to do save urge the courier to make yet greater haste, and, if possible, still more carefully to hide the purpose of his mission. She advised her nephew that she was writing to Paris to beg the Duc de Sonzeval to waste not a moment to take up the matter of the recently deceased uncle's inheritance for if no one were to appear to claim it, there was litigation to be feared. She added that she had requested the Duke to come and give her a complete account of the affair, in order that she might learn whether or not she and her nephew would be obliged to make a journey to Paris. At the time I knew nothing, I was the dupe of everything. Were the appalling crime to be committed as the Count's actions informed me later, he would of course have to commit it himself, but I did not know how. I conjectured much, what good would it do to tell you what I imagined? Rather, let us move ahead to the cruel manner in which I was punished for not having wished to undertake the thing. The criminal capable of having poisoned my aunt is brazen indeed to dare thus write to me after her execrable deed. Better still is the care with which she conceals her retreat, for she may be sure she will be discomfited if she is discovered. But what is it she has the temerity to demand? What are these references to money? Does what she left behind equal the thefts she committed, either during her sojourn in the house or while consummating her final crime? Let her avoid sending a second request similar to this, for she is advised her ambassador will be arrested and held until the law acquaints itself with the place where the guilty party is taking cover. Certainly, dear friend, my father could make ends meet without pursuing either of these two occupations. He pursues both at once, it is because of the two motives I am going to reveal to you. He practices medicine because he has a liking for it, he takes keen pleasure in using his skill to make new discoveries, he has made so many of them, he has written so many authoritative texts based upon his investigations that he is generally acknowledged the most accomplished man in France at the present time. He worked for twenty years in Paris, and for the sake of his amusements he retired to the country. The real surgeon at Saint-Marcel is someone named Rombeau whom he has taken under his tutelage and with whom he collaborates upon experiments, and now, Therese, would you know why he runs a school? Libertinage, my child, libertinage alone, a passion he carries to its extremes. My father finds in his pupils of either sex objects whose dependence submits them to his inclinations, and he exploits them. But wait a moment, come with me, today is Friday, one of the three days during the week when he corrects those who have misbehaved. It is in this kind of punishment my father takes his pleasure. Follow me, I tell you, you shall see how he behaves. Everything is visible from a closet in my room which adjoins the one where he concludes his business. Let's go there without making any noise, and above all be careful not to say a word both about what I am telling you and what you're about to witness. Don't believe a word of it, these are trifles my invents by way of pretext. That little creature is an angel, it is because she resists him he treats her harshly. Dear Heaven! How is one able to surrender oneself to such excesses? How can one find pleasure in the torments one inflicts? Ah, you do not know everything. Listen, what you have seen has perhaps enabled you to understand that when my father discovers some aptitudes in his young pupils, he carries his horrors much further. He abuses the girls in the same manner as he deals with the boys. By this means the girls are not in the least dishonored, there are no pregnancies to fear, and nothing prevents them from finding a husband. Not a year goes by without his corrupting nearly all the boys in this way, and at least half the other children. Of the 14 girls you have seen, eight have already been spoiled by these methods, and he has taken his pleasure with nine of the boys, the two women who serve him are submitted to the same horrors. O Therese, O dear girl, and I too, yes I, he seduced me in my earliest years. I was barely 11 when I became his victim, when, alas I was unable to defend myself against him. Come hither, that room where he chastises his students is the same wherein he enjoys us. The lessons are over now, it is the hour when, warmed by the preliminaries, he is going to compensate himself for the restraint his prudence sometimes imposes upon him. Go back to where you were, dear girl, and with your own eyes behold it all. Anatomy will never reach its ultimate state of perfection until an examination has been performed upon the vaginal canal of a 14 or 15-year-old girl who has expired from a cruel death. It is only from the contingent contraction we can obtain a complete analysis of a so highly interesting part. The same holds true for the hymeneal membrane. We must, of course, find a young girl for the dissection. What the deuce is there to be learned after the age of puberty? Nothing. The menstrual discharges rupture the hymen, and all research is necessarily inexact. Your daughter is precisely what we need. Although she is 15, she is not yet mature. The manner in which we have enjoyed her has done no damage to the membranous tissue, and we will be able to handle her with complete immunity from interference. I must say, I am delighted you have decided to go ahead at last. Oh, I certainly have. I find it odious that futile considerations should check the progress of science, did great men ever allow themselves to be enslaved by such contemptible chains? And, when Michelangelo wished to render a Christ after Nature, did he make the crucifixion of a young man the occasion for a fit of remorse? Why no. He copied the boy in his death agonies. But where it is a question of the advance of our art, how absolutely essential such means become, and how the evil in permitting them dwindles to insignificance. Only think of it. You sacrifice one, but you save a million, perhaps, can one hesitate when the price is so modest? Is the murder operated by the law of a species different from the one we are going to perform? And is not the purpose of those laws, commonly found so wise, the sacrifice of one in order to save a thousand? But what other way can one approach the problem? There is certainly no other way by which to obtain information. In those hospitals where I worked as a young man I witnessed similar experiments by the thousand, but I must confess that I, in view of the ties which attach you to this creature, I would have thought you might hesitate. What? Because she's my daughter? A capital reason. And what rank do you then suppose this title must allot her in my heart? I place roughly the same value upon a little semen which has hatched its chick, and upon that I am pleased to waste while enjoying myself. One has the power to take back what one has given, amongst no race that has ever dwelled on earth has there been any disputing the right to dispose of one's children as one sees fit. The Persians, the Medes, the Armenians, the Greeks all used this right in its fullest latitude. The constitution decreed by Lycurgus, that paragon of lawgivers, not only accorded fathers every right over their offspring, but even condemned to death those children parents did not care to feed, or those which were discovered malformed. A great proportion of savage peoples kill their young immediately they are born. Nearly all the women of Asia, America, Africa, practice abortions, and are not for that reason covered with discredit. Cook discovered the custom widespread in all the South Sea islands. Romulus permitted infanticide, the law of the 12 tables similarly tolerated it, and until the era of Constantine the Romans killed or exposed their children with impunity. Aristotle recommended this pretended crime, the Stoic sect thought it praiseworthy. It's still very much in use in China. Every day one stays lying in the streets and floating in the canals of Peking, over 10 thousand individuals immolated or abandoned by their parents, and in that wisely-governed empire no matter what a child's age may be a father need but put it into the hands of a judge to be rid of it. According to the laws of the Parthians, one killed one's son, one's daughter, or one's brother, even at the age of nubility. Caesar discovered the custom universal amongst the Gauls. Several passages in the Pentateuch prove that amongst the children of God one was allowed to kill one's children, and, finally, God Himself ordered Abraham to do just that. It's long been believed, declares a celebrated modern author, that the prosperity of empires depends upon the slavery of children. This opinion is supported by the healthiest logic. Why, a monarch will fancy himself authorized to sacrifice 20, 30 thousand of his subjects in a single day in order to achieve his own ends, and a father is not to be allowed, when he esteems it propitious to become the master of his children's lives. What absurdity! O folly! What is this inconsistency, this feebleness in them upon whom such chains are binding. A father's authority over his children, the only real one, the one that serves as basic to all others, that authority is dictated by the voice of Nature herself, and the intelligent study of her operations provides examples of it at every turn and instant. Czar Peter was in no doubt as to this right. He used it habitually, and addressed a public declaration to all the orders of his empire, in which he said that, according to laws of human and divine, a father had the entire and absolute right to sentence his children to death, without appeal and without consulting the opinion of anyone at all. It is only in our own barbarous France that a false and ludicrous pity has presumed to suppress this prerogative. No, no, my friend, I will never understand how a father, who's had the kindness to provide it with life, may not be at liberty to bestow death upon his issue. 'Tis the ridiculous value we place upon life which eternally makes us speak drivel about the kind of deed to which a man resorts in order to disencumber himself with a fellow traveler. But the cessation of this existence, or rather what follows it, is no more an evil than life is a good, or rather, if nothing dies, if nothing is destroyed, if nothing at all is lost to Nature, if all the decomposed parts of any body whatsoever merely await dissolution to reappear immediately under new forms, then how indifferent is this act of murder? And how dare one find any evil in it? In this connection I act according to my own whim. I ought to regard the thing as very simple indeed, especially so when it becomes necessary to an act of such vital importance to mankind, when it can furnish such a wealth of knowledge. Henceforth it is a crime or an evil no longer, my friend. No, not a petty misdemeanor, it is the best, the wisest, the most useful of all actions, and crime would exist only in refusing oneself the pleasure of committing it. Dear fellow. I applaud you, your wisdom enchants me, but I find your indifference astonishing. I would have thought you would have been more amorous. I, in love with a girl? Rombeau. I supposed you knew me better. I employ these creatures when there's nothing better to hand. The extreme penchant I have for pleasures of the variety you have make very precious to me all the temples at which this sort of incense may be offered, and to multiply my devotion I sometimes assimilate a little girl into a pretty little boy, but should one of these female personages unhappily nourish my illusions for too long, my disgust energetically manifests itself, and I have yet found but one means to satisfy it deliciously. You understand me, Rombeau. Chilperic, the most voluptuous of France's kings, held the same views. His boisterous organ proclaimed aloud that in an emergency one could make use of a woman, but upon the express condition one exterminated her as soon as one had done with her. This little wench has served my pleasures for five years, now it's time she paid for my loss of interest with her loss of existence. Ah, wretch, where are you going? Why, here's the rascal who has encouraged your flight. Therese, now we see the results of your great virtuous principles, the kidnapping of a daughter from her father! Certainly, and I must do so when that father is so barbarous as to plot against his daughter's life. Well, well! Espionage and seduction. All a servant's most dangerous vices. Upstairs, up with you, I say. The case requires to be judged. Let's punish her a thousand times more than we would were we to take her life. Let's brand her. This disgrace, joined to all the sorry business about her body, will get her hanged if she does not first die of hunger. And our more prolonged vengeance will become the more delicious.
