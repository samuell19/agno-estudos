Between 1963 and 1969, the BBC recorded 253 episodes of Doctor Who. Today, only 143 episodes remain for us to enjoy. Even the Daleks, the arch enemy of the Doctor, couldn't escape extermination. We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks. We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves. Exterminate all humans! Exterminate all humans! Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! (ALL) Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy... (FADES OUT) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) (WHIRRING) Where the devil are you? (ANIMALS CALL IN UNDERGROWTH) - Come on! - (CRUNCH) (GASPS) (WAILS) (WHOOSHING) The 12-part adventure story "The Daleks' Master Plan" is a good example of how Doctor Who episodes were destroyed then rediscovered. That sequence showed the last few remaining extracts from episode one, kept because they were sent to a BBC film library. Other extracts from episodes two, three and four were also kept. Some are original film sequences. Others survive because they were featured in programmes such as "Blue Peter". Operate pyroflames. We obey. (FLAMES ROAR AND HISS) You must find someone you can trust. Someone higher up that can help. Karlton is in charge of security, but he's very close to Chen. - Karlton may be part of the plan. - It's possible. (ELECTRONIC WHINE) Whatever's happening? I think we're changing course! Boosters won't fire. I can't get around. - Switch to manual control! - I can't! I believe we're approaching the gravitational point of that planet. (BRET VYON) Desperus! (DOCTOR) Mm. - Has it any atmosphere? - Yes, but we'll never get off again. - Why not? - Desperus is a penal planet. Well, surely there are guards there to help us. There aren't any. The only craft which stop are prison ships. - If we crash, we'll be left to rot. - Try to land softly! I can't. This vessel is out of my control! Space vessel's instruments now randomised. On course for planet Desperus. Impact in point six. Remote control standing by. Cut in remote control. Now under Dalek control. - Stop that! Turn the talk-back on again! - There's no point. - Turn it on before he really hurts her. - He can't kill her or he hasn't a hostage. - You animal! - (KIRKSEN) That's just a start! - Do as I say! - (DOCTOR) Change course! That's more like it! Take him back to Kembel! Let the Daleks deal with him. - And us. - Don't worry. We'll get out. - (KATARINA SCREAMS) - (KIRKSEN) Stop that! I can't sacrifice everything for the sake of one girl. Without us, you wouldn't have got off Kembel at all! All right, but without me, you wouldn't have either. All right, but I won't let you hurt Katarina. Head for Kembel. - On the way, we may be able to rescue her. - (KIRKSEN) You won't! No! Not that one! Katarina! Katarina! In 1983, two complete episodes of "The Daleks' Master Plan" were returned to the BBC. What they were doing in the basement of a Mormon church remains a mystery. Well, two down, ten more to find. While most episodes were returned from the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Enterprises, many more only survive thanks to dedicated fans and film collectors, who were sometimes unaware of the importance of their finds. I bought "Evil Of The Daleks" part two and "The Faceless Ones" part three at a movie museum car boot sale in 1983. They happened to be in the boot of an elderly dealer who had various TV stuff, and two "Doctor Who" episodes caught my eye. At the time, I wasn't particularly interested in Doctor Who, but "Daleks" caught my eye, having been a fan as a child, so I thought, "I'll have them if the price is right." And it was. Eight pounds, knocked down from twelve, incredibly enough. Move! The weight of your body has fallen by 17 ounces. What do you expect? (SHOUTS) What do you expect? - For pity's sake, let me go! - Speak when you are told to speak. I didn't realise the rarity of the episodes. I assumed the BBC had loads of excess copies of things like Doctor Who and other things, so it didn't occur to me that these may be the only copies in existence. These actually are the original prints which I bought then. "The Evil Of The Daleks", "The Faceless Ones". 16mm optical sound. There we are. Jamie, look! Hey! What's that, Doctor? Someone who's not used to the Earth's atmosphere. In February 1983, I put an advert in my local paper, just advertising for anyone with privately owned film collections to let me know if they had any TV-related episodes, including Doctor Who. Purely by chance, one person actually replied, who, again by chance, didn't have anything, but had been in contact with a collector in Southampton, who, he recalled, did have several Doctor Who episodes. It turned out that one of the episodes was part three of "The Wheel In Space". The X-rays are processed now. Will you turn the light out, Jamie? Here we go. Let's see what we've got. - What's that?! - (DOCTOR) It's a Cybermat! The lights, Jamie. The lights. Cybermats. - That means the Cybermen must be here too. - Yes. And there's only one place they can be - on that rocket! Part three of "The Wheel In Space" was the earliest surviving episode featuring Patrick Troughton and Cybermats, until the later recovery of "The Tomb Of The Cybermen" in 1992. Last time, they were frozen for five centuries. This time, it must be for ever. (ELECTRONIC SCREECH) The classic Doctor Who story "Tomb Of The Cybermen" was returned in 1992 from a television station in...Hong Kong. The reason why episodes are missing from the archives is somewhat complicated. Sue Malden was the BBC's first archive selector, a post not established until1978. (SUE) Like many programmes, the BBC doesn't have a full set of "Doctor Who" episodes. The problems of the rights of the artists and the material and also the BBC's agreements with unions like the Musicians' Union and Equity severely limited the number of transmissions and the kind of use the BBC could make of programming. Originally, this was limited to one UK transmission with one repeat. Thereafter, we see library records indicating that programmes were released for junking or wiping. Take the strain. Stand by. The good news was, though, that we know that Enterprises - or Worldwide now - who sold BBC programmes, often had to transfer the videotape original to film, because many of their customers were still using film rather than videotape. We tracked down many of these film recordings with Worldwide and with their customers. This was a great opportunity to find not just Doctor Who but many other programmes. Series of "Z Cars" came back, "Till Death Us Do Part", "Up Pompeii", but particularly many Doctor Who episodes came back to the archive that way. From that, we know that virtually every Doctor Who was film-recorded, so they are out there somewhere. We've had many successes. They've begun to dry up, but we're always hopeful that there will be some programmes or extracts found out there somewhere. It was our pioneer groundwork that caused these to be found. Otherwise, they'd have all gone the way of all flesh. Everybody knew we were looking. Picture the scene, 1978, John Bridger from Film Library Sales takes me into BBC Enterprises film vault for the first time, like a kid in a sweet shop. All these cans of Doctor Who prints, but my eyes went to this pile of cans - there were 28 cans in the pile - taped up with gaffer tape, and a big oblong sticker, "Withdrawn, de-accessioned and junked", on the top. These were there to be burnt. These were all seven negatives and positives in English and all seven negatives and positives in Arabic of the entire story of "The Daleks". - Any luck, Grandfather? - Hmm? - Have you made another fluid link? - I can't. I've looked through my spares and discovered we need mercury. - Oh, no. - We're in a jam. I must get that fluid link back. I'm afraid my little trick has rebounded on me. We called Sue Malden, who was in a newly created post of senior archivist, and I told her that they were destroying these prints at Enterprises. They obviously thought the BBC film library had them all and they had viewing prints that they could get rid of - which they had been doing. From 1972, every Doctor Who episode existed. Up to 1978, they had systematically destroyed around 160 episodes, of which we found a few in other sources. Help! Cannot control! Cannot control! Help me! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! (WAILS) (IAN) When I started looking for missing episodes in 1977, "The Space Pirates" was only eight years old. It is not unreasonable to find episodes that old, to think you'll turn them up. It is completely unreasonable now, in 1998, to think that "Marco Polo" that was shown in 1964, 34 years ago... Things like that, if they were gonna turn up, they would have turned up. Please prove me wrong, but I think there will always be 110 missing episodes. It's sadly unlikely that any more missing Doctor Who episodes will turn up, but material does still resurface. Recently, a series of clips from missing episodes were discovered in the archives of the Australian government censor. When overseas-produced programmes were offered to Australian TV stations, they were sent to the film censorship board for classification before screening. (SCREAMS) You're a fool, Joe Longfoot. Tell me what I want to know. Speak up! Avery's...curse on you... ..you black villain. In early '96, I began research into the screening of Doctor Who in Australia. This included accessing the censor board's original notes on the series. The government archive internet site led me to particular documents which contained the details that I needed. Several references pointed to footage actually being returned to the board's offices after the physical cutting had taken place at the ABC. It will be a merry night, but... (JAMAICA) No! No! (CROAKS) Fare ye well...Jamaica. Returning cut footage was the best way to ensure that required deletions had been made. I knew that much of the cut material was from episodes not known to exist, and I was very excited about locating them. Keep away! Bring her here. Don't be difficult, girl. It's quite painless. Lights. One tiny jab, and you'll know nothing more about it until it's all over. (SOBS) - The lights are playing up again. - Go and see what's wrong. (RUMBLING) Of all the clips, the best one is from "Fury From The Deep", lasting just under a minute. In the clip, two characters, Mr Oak and Mr Quill, both possessed by the mysterious weed creature, enter Mrs Harris's room and exhale toxic fumes which engulf her. It's possibly the most chilling sequence ever filmed for Doctor Who. What are you doing in here? Is there something that you want? (HISSING) (COUGHS) No! (POUNDING HEARTBEAT) Clips from "The Macra Terror" are nice, as there's only one publicity photo of the Macra beast. These clips show the monster in the shadows. This was responsible for the feel of that story. (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Ben! What is it? Help me! Get it off me, Ben! (SCREAMS) It's got my foot! Oh, Ben! (SCREAMS) Help me, Ben! Help me! Help me! There's another one! (SCREAMS) Ben, they're all around us! (SCREAMS) - I'll obey! - (JAMIE) What's that? These censored clips are important as they give us a proper taste of what many missing episodes were really like. (DOCTOR) Let's get out of here. (DOCTOR) Get us out of here! Bring the lift down! (JAMIE) Victoria, why aren't you listening? (DOCTOR) Why doesn't this work? Jamie, look! (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (GASPS) (HISSING) Robson, listen. Can you hear me? (DOCTOR ON RADIO) Come back, man. Come back! Don't you realise what they're trying to do? - They're trying to control you. - Now, listen... Although only a few clips exist from "Fury From The Deep", some intriguing behind-the-scenes footage does exist, revealing some of the secrets of the special effects wizards who helped make Doctor Who what it was. Keep away from it! Keep away! "Fury From The Deep" was the last story I appeared in. There is also similar footage surviving from my first story, detailing the filming of the explosive climax to "The Evil Of The Daleks". - Exterminate! - This is your emperor speaking. There is danger here. Obey me. Do not fight in here. Do not fight in here! I said obey! (ALARM) Obey me! Your emperor is ordering you! You will not fight in here! Do not fight in here! (VOICE BECOMES DISTORTED) Obey! Obey! Obey! You will be exterminated! All exterminated! (FRAZER) The final end. Perhaps the most sought-after missing episode is the fourth and final installment of "The Tenth Planet". It was William Hartnell's last episode and the first to feature the concept of regeneration. Some clips do survive from part four and from the following story, "The Power Of The Daleks", starring Patrick Troughton. The following sequence was assembled from material of varying quality, so do not adjust your set. This gives us an insight into how the first transition to another Doctor was achieved. ..unless my body is wearing thin. - What do you mean? - Don't worry, child. It's far from being all over. (ELECTRONIC PULSING AND HUMMING) (POLLY) Doctor! Help him! (BEN) No, leave him. (WHOOSHING) (ELECTRONIC PULSING) (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Remember what he said? "This old body of mine is wearing thin." So he gets himself a new one?! It's over. - What are we gonna do? - It is the Doctor. I know it is...I think. It's not only his face. He doesn't even act like him. One of the most impressive finds in recent years comes from 1965's "Galaxy Four". This four-part story remained intact until the BBC's last copy was destroyed in 1977. However, a clip from the first episode was used in a documentary about Doctor Who. This hinted at the whereabouts of further footage. (DOCTOR WHO THEME) While they were making the "Lively Arts" documentaries, Steven Payne and I were advising with the facts side of it. During our chats, it became apparent that there were some film extracts for reference purposes in the documentary, which would be flung out. So we said, "Fling 'em out to us," and, very nicely, they did. And they sat around for a few years, and it wasn't until we discovered what was left of Doctor Who in the archives that we discovered that "Galaxy Four" didn't exist any more as a full programme. We offered it to the archives, who said, "No, thank you. We're after full programmes. "Extracts are not really interesting." Of course, things have changed now. Extracts are very interesting, so this seems very much the time to see an extract from "Galaxy Four". - Oh! Oh, good gracious! - Are you all right? Yes. Hard performing physical exercise at my age. They're nearly here. Quickly, inside. Close external door. Close external door. Well, it was a decent spaceship once. Pretty backward now, isn't it? It's almost fossilised. - Oh, it's got one or two good features. - We only just beat those Chumblies. - Are we safe here? - Yes. They cannot enter. Silence. Maaga is coming. - Maaga? We're back there again. - (THEY LAUGH) - Report. - Mission accomplished. - We have brought the prisoners. - Prisoners?! - And the metal mesh? - It stopped the machine. - We...could not get the mesh back. - What? It became affixed to the machine. - She's got them pretty frightened, Doctor. - Madam, she speaks the truth. The Chumblies are magnetised. I will deal with you both later. Sit. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Won't you sit down? Ah, yes. Thank you, I will. - I must hear the report first. - Naturally. - It is necessary in war. - War? - With the Rills. - The Chumblies. It is a fight for existence itself. - I see. - In which one of us will be obliterated. - As bad as that? - Yes. So bad that it is conceivable that you, too, will be obliterated. - There's no need to exaggerate. - No exaggeration. You want to kill us, don't you? You want to. When a planet disintegrates, nothing survives. Disintegrates? This planet? Hm? Yes. It's in its last moments of life. - Soon it will explode. - When? In 14 dawns' time. How can you be so certain? The Rills told us. That is why they're repairing their spaceship - to escape. Well, that sounds reasonable enough to me. We must capture that spaceship from them. - What for? This is a spaceship as well. - It cannot fly. The Rills shot us down. We cannot move. You don't belong here? No. Nor do the Rills. We come from Drahva, and 400 dawns ago, we were investigating this section of the galaxy. We were looking for a planet like this, capable of supporting life, to colonise it. - There are too many of us. - All women? - Women? - (STAMMERS) Yes. Feminine, female. Oh, we have a few men, as many as we need. The rest we kill. They consume valuable food and fulfill no particular function. These are not really human. They are cultivated in test tubes. We have very good scientists. I am a living being. They are products. Inferior products, grown for a purpose and capable of nothing more. - Grown for what purpose? - To fight, to kill. Yours must be a very interesting civilisation. - You attacked the Rills? - No. We were in space above this planet. We saw a ship such as we had never seen before. We did not know it, but it was a Rill ship. It fired on us, and we crashed. Before we did, we managed to fire back, so that they crashed too. On landing, they killed one of my soldiers. What are they like, these Rills? Disgusting. Well, that's no description, no description at all. That's all I'll say. Yes, I think I'm beginning to understand. So am I, Doctor. This planet's about to explode. The Rills have repaired their ship in time to escape. You haven't, so you want their ship. We have no desire to be here when this planet ceases to exist. Machine approaching! (RHYTHMIC BLEEPING) To your stations. - Switch off the radio. - What are they doing? - Having another go. - Switch off the radio? Why, I wonder? They tell us lies. We do not wish to hear them. Madam, you may not, but I'd like to. - It's not good for my soldiers! - I see. - It's stopped. - Yes, now it is sending its message. - Fire! - (HISSING BLAST) (HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) (CHUCKLES) You didn't do very much damage, did you? My only intention was to scare it off. We've succeeded. To your places. And you haven't destroyed one Chumbly yet. - We will. - I think you rather underestimate the Rills. Why tell you that this planet is dying? They were trying to tempt us on board their spaceship to kill us. - It seems as if they offered you help. - That is what they maintain. - They might have been speaking the truth. - Or it might have been a pack of lies. Generally, what happened to Doctor Who episodes in New Zealand, even those not screened, was they were sent on to another country. "The Lion" was meant to have been destroyed. I knew that stuff did go walkies from the NZBC and that somewhere, somehow, there must be a Doctor Who that had survived. A film buff from Wellington got wind of the dumping and intercepted the consignment of films and rescued about 200 of them, including "The Lion". I bumped into Cornelius Stone, an old friend, in an Auckland comic store, and we were discussing 16mm film prints and the name Bruce Grenville came up, who was a friend of Corn's. We were discussing some stuff that Bruce had, and I light-heartedly said, "He doesn't have any Doctor Who, does he?" Corn said, "Yeah, I think he does." In 1998, Larry Duggan, a fellow film buff in New Zealand, purchased a big collection of old films, and one of those films was "The Lion". I added the film to my collection of 16mm movies and showed it regularly to my friends, and must have screened it quite a number of occasions at my home and out on other locations, but I was totally unaware of the importance of the film. I assumed it was a 16mm print, of which the BBC have hundreds, and I assumed these films were fairly common. - I'll take a look around. - Yes, yes. Bruce very graciously allowed us to videotape the episode, so at least we'd have a visual record of it for starters. I contacted Paul, because he had a video camera, and that night we went round to Bruce's and er...it was pretty amazing. I immediately contacted the BBC's restoration team, and then negotiated with Bruce to borrow the episode for a few weeks. I'm sure that not only in New Zealand, but anywhere in the world, somewhere, somehow, someone will find more Doctor Who. They're out there somewhere.
