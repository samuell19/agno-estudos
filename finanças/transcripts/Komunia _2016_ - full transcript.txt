COMMUNION Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't you see where it goes? Can't put his own belt on. Sheesh! You can't... Boy, it's cold. Cold metal. Wrong again! Wrong, wrong, wrong again! The other way round. The other way round. Don't you get it? Don't you know what it means? The other way round. And wrong again, my gosh. Nikodem, you've packed the wrong books. - You don't need this today. - Stop throwing things. And you didn't need it yesterday... ...or on Friday. - Don't throw it! - So you've packed your books, yeah? You don't have IT today. See how light your backpack is now. And take the religion notebook out. Oh no. - Take it out. - But... 'No Mongols allowed.' 'Life is a rat.' 'He was born to be a rat.' 'When Jesus was born, the dinosaurs& The dinosaurs.' What? 'Most of the dinosaurs&' Why do you write these things? - Shall I tear it out? - Don't! That's not the right topic for a religion class. - Shame on you. - 'The end of Jesus.' Great. Shame on you! I'll tell the teacher you can't do that in the religion class. Stand up, everyone. Lidka, Nikodem. Let's pray. Come on! 'In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.' Sit down. Good evening. Dad! It's the welfare officer. - What? - It's the welfare officer. Come inside, Marek. The dog is running away very fast. - I've heard things aren't going so well. - Kind of. - What's going on? - Some problems with my classes. - Not only the classes. - My behaviour could be better... You mean this? I've got an appointment with the doctor on Monday. She'll fill it in. Is that it? You've been drinking. For heaven's sake. - Coffee! - You know I can always tell. I only drank coffee and ate dinner! Are you messing with me? - How many beers have you had today? - None! You're weren't standing in front of that shop for no reason. I'm telling the truth. Do you want me to report this? Do what you want. I wasn't drinking! - Listen... - Look, I was there to buy... - I'm not going to ask Ola. - Excuse me? I'm not going to ask Ola because she'd tell me the truth. You're not thinking. At all! This will destroy everything you've been building. Ola can't take care of Nikodem on her own. If anything happens to him I will be held responsible. 99 people out of a 100 would take these kids today. But if I see you drunk again there won't be anything left to talk about. - Shut up will ya? - I'm not a human. It's too much. Leave it alone! Don't touch it! You're so smart, but you can't even light it. Leave it! Stop touching it. - It's not burning. - You're not burning. - It goes out when you open it. - So why open it? An animal can kill another animal. An animal can kill another animal, unless it's a human being. The one that is most expansive shouldn't kill at all. Here, for tomorrow. Don't you want it? Thank you. Take my heart. Let them sing thy honour. My heart, my soul. Lord Jesus, take it. The church... ...is no place for stress-free education. Maybe the school is, but not the church. I want to remind parents, yet again, that they are responsible for religious education. They cannot leave this up to the priest or teacher. Let me recall the words of the Scripture. Whom the Lord loves he chastens. He has strong demands. I have a runny nose and it won't go away. And a cough. The communion is on the 25th. Are you coming? I don't know. I'll let you know, don't you worry. - And apart from that? - Everything's fine. The church is on Partyzant√≥w St. Yeah. I'm eating soup. This greasy broth. Yesterday I cooked some yummy chicken for him. With carrots, vegetables and potatoes. I made it for him with carrots and a chicken leg. I see. And it made a nice yellow broth. So I decided to give him some today. All right, I'm off. - I've run out of free minutes. - Sure. - Bye. - Bye. 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen.' Once again and then your turn. 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen.' Now your turn. See? It's not that long. 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners...' Stop messing around. '...now and in the hour of our death.' Say 'Hail Mary'. Have you ever tried an olive? - Yes or no? - No. So why did you say it was yuck? - Why? - Because. You keep giving Casper money. I asked about it today. You keep doing that. - Why? - I want him to be rich. - So you want to be poor? - No. - You will be. Carry it properly! Right now! - That's not right! - Carry it in front of you. That's not right at all. Nikodem! Oh, it's you lady. - Excuse me? - It's you, lady. - Come in. - Right now? 'As a bonus we get... God's love.' Let's stick it here. Come here, boys. '2 for the price of 1. You forgive others, God forgives you.' 'A sale price on God's mercy.' 'The best price is the 3-pack: prayer, fasting and charity.' The three good deeds: fasting, prayer and charity. Well done. We're not finished yet. All right. As we all want to get to heaven like Magdalene in the song let me repeat the moves: when all the saints go to heaven. You all know it well. Let's sing. Nikodem, can you help us? We'll all sing together. Together, all right? When all the saints go to heaven, St. Peter plays the sax, The little angels drum on the tables and Magdalene dances along. Cha cha cha. How may times must I say it? I'm not the air. I have arms, legs, I have a head and a torso. Did somebody say something, or was that just the sound of the air? You're mean. Please, I'm not the air. I am an animal. What are you doing? Time to get out. You can't sit here forever. Oh no. Look at all the bubble bath you used up. - But... - Just look! That much. Get out of the tub. - No. - Get out. Is mum there? Magda's out. She'll be back in 5 minutes. OK, thanks. - I'll be back in 15 minutes. - When will you be back? - And where are you? - I'm in... You're at the pub. Dad, Jesus, who are you kidding? Yourself? If you are not drinking, come back home. He's on his way. Here you are. Thank you. Is this the kind you wanted? It's fashionable. - But don't lose it. - What about the crisps? Don't lose it, because your hand will grow. Put it here for now. - I'll put it on later. - And the crisps? Try it to see if it fits. This is good. - What? - It's really good. - It cost more so it ought to be better. - And my crisps? - Dad'll have to go to the shop. - I'll get you a different watch. Did your mother call? And? She only talked about the kid. I asked her when she's coming. She said she would be here by Wednesday. For sure. Whatever. - What does it mean to believe? - To believe. What is virtue? Which virtues are the most important? What is a commandment? Which one is the most important? Who is the pope? - The bishop? Priests? - Priests? Aren't you ever going to learn? You won't receive communion. He won't accept you. He is mean. He'll be meaner than I am. - He'll shout and he'll send you away. - But he should be kind to me. Why should he if you don't know anything? Repeat 'The Act of Contrition'. - 'O my God, I repent...' - 'O my God', eh... - 'O my God, I repent...' - 'O my God, I repent... ...of my anger... ...only for thy love. Give me your grace. For you I forgive my neighbour.' What do I do for you? What do you do for God? - You for-give. - Grief. Your neighbour, retard. You're not focused. I can't learn English, I have to sit with you, and you do nothing! - Don't call! - Are you going to study? If you're nice I will. - Niko, darling, please study now. - You're just pretending to be nice. - Study. Stop staring at your nails. - These are claws. - Either your claws or studying. - All right. 'A conscience is apti...' It's a difficult word. You can't! Dad, talk to him. We are supposed to go to church, he has got to take the exam. He doesn't know anything and he won't study. He won't receive communion if he doesn't pass. 'The pope is Jesus's deputy.' We have to be there at 6 pm. But dad, he didn't learn it and that priest is strict. If he doesn't know the answers there will be no communion for him. It's no joke. And it's a waste of money. 'You shall love God with all your heart.' - I've invited mum already. - '...with all your heart.' How long will you punish him for this time? - A long time. All right. Bye. - It won't be for long. Dad said he'd keep his word this time. He will punish you for a long time. Not just for 5 minutes. No laptop, tablet, sweets, no nothing. No pleasurable things. I hope the priest will be nice. But he isn't nice to children who don't study. And you don't study. So if you know everything he'll be nicer to you than God above. He'll be very nice. But if you don't study he will shout at you. 10 times worse than I do. - And I am mean, aren't I? - Yes. So he's 10 times worse. Imagine that. Like the devil. Are you ready? Give me the cap. Don't be nervous. Tell me, who is God? God is the creator of the world and our best Father. Well done. And what is Scripture? - Dude, can we go in order? - In order? Fine. Don't say 'dude'. Say 'father'. Who is man? Man is a creature of God consisting of body and soul immortal. Why can't we see God? Because he is a spirit. Great. Who is the Holy Trinity? God the Father, the Son of God and the Holy Spirit. And who is Jesus Christ? Jesus Christ is the second person of the trinity. Became man and died on the cross for our salvation. And rose from the dead. Very good. Who is the Holy Spirit? The third person of the Holy Trinity. What is Scripture? The books written and inspired by the Holy Spirit. - And how many books are there? - 73. Go on, be more specific. How many in the Old Testament? 46 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New. Great. What are the gifts of the Holy Spirit? There are seven. List them. Knowledge, understanding, fortitude, wisdom, piety, fear of the lord and one more. I have to think. Try again. Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, fortitude, fear of the lord, piety and& - Cou... - Counsel. Sorry, but we demand a rematch! Rematch, rematch! You call this a home? It's a pigsty! Nikodem, where is the TV set? I won't ask you again. - Who took the TV set? - He wanted to fix it. - Who wanted to? - He wanted to fix it. - Who? - The TV set. - Who? - A man. - What man? - I don't know. Jesus... So much for the show. Where is the TV set? Ola, don't hit him. I'm not hitting him. Where is the TV set? Are you deaf? Get up. Get up, dad. I've had enough. Is there nothing normal in this place? - Any problems? - No, none in particular. - Any worries? - Not really. Are you sure? - Is everything fine? - Yes. - How are you getting on with your dad? - It's fine. We quarrel a bit sometimes, no more then usual. Bear, bear, bear, polar bear. Polar bear. Bear, bear, be... Lions, lions, lions! It's a mammal. Lions, lions! I'm a lion! A green rhino. Green. A green rhino! Couldn't Karol keep an eye on him? You can't do everything by yourself. Yeah, you know, but look. Dad used to go to work, you were at home, so& Now you have to work and take care of the kid. I'm saying that now you have to work and take care of the kid. You put this part around the other part. Like this. Not with two, I can see it's harder for you. With one is more difficult. I can see it's harder with two. - With one. - As if you could see anything. Hold this in one hand, and this in the other. Isn't it easier? Do it here, but not as much. Can you see? This part goes in here. Go on. No, no, don't fall. Hey, Ola! - Can you do this twirl? - What twirl? Have you tried this routine? She didn't practice with us. She told us to make up a routine. You do: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You need 8 steps. She will tell us what fits in and what doesn't. The communion takes all day tomorrow. The communion in the morning, then dinner. We're going to a restaurant. Then going for a walk. Mum is coming. We'll talk and stuff. I have to be nice to him tomorrow. That's a challenge. It's just confession. Can't you go? Dad! I don't want to go at 5 p.m. Leave now. Please. He won't& He'll behave. Listen to me, go with him. He has to learn to listen to you. I'm begging you, dad. It's Saturday. - We still have an hour. - What good is that. In an hour it'll be cold and I won't want to go swimming. - Go now if you want. - Can't we all go swimming now? Swim and dry off in one hour? - It could work. - Yeah, I bet. We're at the church. Come in through the gate. I can see you. We're here. Me and my friends have to wait for you just because you said so. - What time are you home? - Can I...? No! At 8 p.m. Alright. I'll come back as late as I want if I have to stay with you now! Sure you will. But will you get up tomorrow? - Don't worry, I'll get up. - At 6 a.m. If I take care of him now and leave after his confession, can I stay until 10 p.m.? - No longer than 9 p.m.. - 9.30 p.m. - No arguing. - 9.30. - The house is a mess. - 9.30. I have cleaned it. - You haven't done anything. - 9.30. - No, 9.00. - 9.30. - Where are you going? - Nowhere, we'll be around. Alright, I'll see you at 9.30. Jesus& rules! - I am the Lord, I am a Demi- - God! Flee this church for I make& mysterious virtues. Your cap! And come here. - 'I offended God...' - 'I offended God...' - '...with the following sins.' - '...with the following sins.' Good. And then you list your sins. We will come back to this. - One, two... - Don't count them on your fingers. You will confess them to the priest. One more thing. At the confessional you should whisper. Do you know how to whisper? Try to whisper it. 'I have offended God with the following sins.' Say it. 'I have offended God with the following sins.' - Have you ever tormented animals? - No. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Have you ever told any lies? - Maybe you've been lazy? - No, I just& At school, do you always do what the teacher tells you? - Or are you a little lazy? - I do stuff, obviously. But sometimes you are lazy. And laziness is a sin. And when you are angry with someone? With Ola for example? Anger is a sin, too. Did you know that? You shouldn't be angry. You should be forgiving. Alright. Have you ever wanted to eat something really badly? Even take it away from someone else? - Yes. - That's a sin, too. Gluttony. But I don't think gluttony is a sin. I think it's a virtue. No, unfortunately, gluttony is a sin. You mustn't stuff yourself. For me, gluttony is a virtue. - No, it's not. - Yes it is. There are 3 virtues: Faith, Hope, Love. But love is a sin, because they kiss. - And kisses are bad. - They aren't bad. - They are. - Of course not. Of course not between everybody, right? Faith is the first one. The second is Hope - and the last, Gluttony. - No, it's Love. Not Gluttony. Pick it up. Put your tongue like this. Great, but open your mouth wider. Not like that. Open your mouth. Great, perfect, that's how you do it. One more time. And what do you say? - Amem. - Amen, not Amem. Open your mouth. - Amen. - Great. - Amen. - Where did Amen go? - Can you iron my shirt? The pink one? - Alright. - Should we put a tie on him? - No. Why would he need your oversized tie? - I've got a smaller one. It's yellow. - What? - A small one. - Yellow? - Yes, it goes well with a white shirt. - Yeah, sure. Yellow... Will it match at least? It's got horses on it, no doubt? Alright, I'll dress him. And I'll go with him. You're staying for dinner, aren't you? What? - Do you want me to? - I'd like you to. We'll see... Can't Karol take you to church? Our car broke down. It's being repaired. We can pick it up on Tuesday. Don't you have another car? - What? - Don't you have another car? No, we don't. We'd have to borrow one. I don't know if it'll be possible. I'll see how it goes. One's a 5-seater, and the other one is... - I see. - And the bigger one will be taken. Can't you take the smaller one? You could come by yourself. I know but... I don't know how it's going to be. It's the end of May. The drought is coming. The herd has to make a serious choice. Migration or hunger. Jeez... Put on your shoe. Stop moving your leg. Great. Where's the brush? I look like a cartoon character. I'm not going anywhere. - What are you doing? - Shut up! Magda! Is there no one to help you? Can you do it yourself? Yes. Inconceivable happiness. God himself visits me. Jesus, give me your grace so that I may take you in. The memory of my sins brings tears of grief to my eyes. For I have wounded your heart. Oh Jesus, forgive me. Dear Jesus, we shall take you home. Dear Jesus, we won't let anyone take you from us. You shall be with us throughout the days and nights... - Want some coke? - I'm good. Can I have some more ice? - Give it here. - Careful, it might splash. Here's one, anyway. I'll slice it for you. He should learn how to do it. Please tell him you'll stay longer. You can say it's an order. OK, you can take your time. That's what I'm telling you. Alright, bye. - He will take his time, won't he? - Yeah. - He'll pick you up after 8 p.m.? - After 9 p.m. - What? - After 9 p.m. Oh, good. But really? You'll be staying longer? - That's what we arranged. - Please tell him. Tell him you'll be late, because you don't come often. That you have to spend the whole day with him. Endangered. Close, close, close to danger. Endangered. - Your father looks a little tipsy... - No. This situation makes him nervous. And what do you think about this situation? It would be great to have mum around. The biggest fear is that she'd only come for a little while - and then go running back to him. - Remember, it's great to have mum back... Only the flat is too small. - Endangered. - But think about your mum and dad too. - Right. - At first it might be nice. And then it could all go back to how it used to be. Everyone will tell you it's still too early. Despite the fact, that they're trying. I know your heart wants it... Female, female. - It's not the right time yet. - I see. Try to meet up with your mum. - Do you talk on the phone? Often? - Yes, she calls me all the time. Maybe don't just say no to your mum. Try to explain to her that there are many fears. It's not like whatever she says goes... - Female, electricity. - ...there are the two of you, your dad and a number of problems. - Happiness, happiness. - I can see you understand. - Not tomorrow and not next week. - I'm not saying tomorrow. Things have gone too far. She has to cope with her own problems first. What does she have to do? On the 12th she's going to court to change her last name. She has to tell him she's moving out. - I will tell her. - But you know she... Will he beat her up? No. - How do you know he won't? - If he does, she should call the police. - He'll throw her out of the flat. - He can't do that. Without her clothes - he could leave her with nothing. She's a registered tenant, don't you understand? Could we do it in a month from now? - What? - Maybe in a month's time? - It's already been done. - Jeez, I'm talking about mother. - Could we do it in a month? - I don't know, not now! - Look at your trousers. - They're dirty, so what? And you're still wearing them. I don't want her to change her mind in a week or two. - With her, anything's possible. - Will you take her back in a month? - Come on. - Nikodem... - Come on. - No, we'll go home later. - Now. - I told you, no. - Can I go home? - Go to Ola. I don't want to stay out here without my socks. I've had enough. I'm going home. - Calm down, sit here. - If I stay, I'll die. Then I want to die. I want to go home. - I think I got cut off. - I want to go home now. - No! Magda, you're at a dead end and now you have to&. Think about it before Saturday. You can't make hasty decisions now. You have a small child, don't you? Werewolf. Who is a werewolf? Who is a werewolf? A horse. The horse is a werewolf. Or a werehorse. Werehorse. It would be cheaper to get a new flat than to redo this one. Depends on the renovation though. But you know what the renovation would be like. There won't be any furniture. You can redo things as you like. Everything's already done here. We'd have to change everything. And it would be cheaper to get a new flat. The tub isn't that bad. We've got detergents, we could whiten it. - I said something. - We're doing it now. - I have to buy paper. - We have everything we need at home. - Calm down. - Come on, dad! - We'll do it later! That's the end of it! - No, you'll keep postponing it. - Alright. - Are you doing it or not? - OK, write it. - You should write it. - I don't know what to write. - I will tell you. 'I am writing to request...' - I don't know what. A bigger flat. - A council flat. This is not how you go about it. We need to think carefully. I'm sick of this, Ola! - 'I am writing to request...' - Wait. And now write whatever you want. A different flat. A bigger flat. But you'll need to justify it. We should really think about it, and not act on a whim. We did think about it. There are reasons. Write whatever you want. You could help me a bit. - We're going to burn your snake. - No! - It's in the rubbish. - I'll have no part in this murderous game. - Get out! - I have to save him from death. We're going to burn these. Save the toy. Happiness, happiness... Don't worry. You stink. You're so dirty. I have to give you a bath. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. However, she will. Quiet. - Stay there. - Quiet as a little mouse. I have to fix you up before your bath. I have to fix your holey mistake. - Why did you buy so many cucumbers? - What? I'll eat them. - All 20, for sure. - Put it here, I'll throw it away. - What do you want?! - What's going on with you? You've been like this for several days now. You never like what I do. - Get out of there! - Calm down! - That's enough, Ola. - Stop it! Ola! She doesn't answer my calls. She doesn't answer my calls either. Maybe she can't. It pisses me off. Maybe she can't. Get lost! - Watch your language. - Maybe she can't talk! Reality becomes fi... becomes fict... becomes fiction. She might be afraid. - Or maybe he took her phone. - I wondered about that too. Don't use too much water! Give me his number, I'll call him. - No, it's the wrong number. - Let me see. Ola! - Is that your mum? - No it isn't. Get out of my sight! Shut up, or& What's wrong with you? Nothing! You're pissing me off. - Hi. - Hi. - Close the door. - Better keep it open. Damn, the most important part. Oh God. The most important part. - Look. And where's the mattress? - Right there. - Yes, but what will we put it on? - I don't know. Damn it. - I didn't see it there. - Because he kept it hidden. - We have this. - And the sides. - How is he supposed to sleep? - I'm thinking. Maybe we could find some plywood? - We have to get it, it's an important part. - I know. Well done. It holds together so it should be OK. My little helper! I'll fix it later. Nikodem, you can come in useful. Hold the bed here. Just hold it up. Ola, hold it tighter. I need him here. Go to mum. Drop that. Leave the toys for later. Help mummy. Don't you want to? Go where mum tells you to. All right, hold it children. Nikodem! You have to let the water out of the tub. - Why didn't you let the water out? - He's crying. It's your fault. You threw a toy at him. - I did not. - Bath and bed, darling. Come back home. We're going to bed. Come up. - He has to adapt. - Get out! Are you deaf? You're really getting on my nerves now. Get up. Did you make the bed? A crooked-neck duck. - You're not sleeping with me today. - I am. - Your mother is sleeping with me. - Then I'm sleeping with the two of you. How? The bed is too small. I'm not sleeping alone. - You can sleep next to the baby. - Pardon? What's so funny? - Mum made a mistake. - She'll get used to it. What now? Change your whole life, fuck. Shut up will ya? The baby's asleep. - What? - The baby is asleep. Will you shut up? - I'm not even allowed to watch TV. - Shut the fuck up. A cheetah. Why did it leave? Because it's a horse. Because it's a horse, stupid. A horse. Where are you moving it? Where are you moving it? I'm asking. To Karol's place? To Karol's place? - No. - No? Happiness! Attention, a human child has broken out of the child-house. From the child-house. Be quiet. - Are you taking it apart? - Yeah. - Why? - I don't like it. The bed? Can you tell me what's the matter? Are you moving out? What are you moving out? - Tell me what happened. - Nothing. Is she moving out? - I told you this would happen. - I knew it too. Stop it. There's nothing we can do. Just don't stress out dad, OK? You're not going downstairs, dad. Stay here. We'll talk later. I knew this would happen. Why are you sad? I'm just sad. Grown-ups have problems kids can't understand. Dad, no beer. Stay away from the beer. I know. - Only the foal stays with me. - Do you want to keep it? - Yes. Only the foal survived... the surprise attack. It has to save the other toys. The survivor.
