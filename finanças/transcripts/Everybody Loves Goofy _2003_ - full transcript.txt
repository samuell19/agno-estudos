You forgot the... - Hello from London. - London loves Goofy! We love Goofy. My favourite is Goofy because I think he's funny. He's, like, a bit funny and a bit silly and... yeah. - He's sweet. - He keeps bumping into things. I like when he does the swimming. [gulping] [gulping] [narrator] Everyone should learn how to swim. Perhaps no one factor has contributed so greatly to the current popularity of swimming as has the sensible bathing suit. It should not be too daring, yet bold enough to allow freedom of movement. In the privacy and safety of your own home, and with the aid of a piano stool... ...we learn the basic strokes of swimming. Breathing is of first importance. For, after all, we must breathe, you know. [inhaling and exhaling] Study, carefully, the synchronised movement of arms and legs in the overhand or windmill stroke, compared with the sleek glide - of the Australian crawl. - [brakes screeching] [horns wailing] The side stroke is actually the basic stroke for all advanced methods of swimming. Note the grace and ease of the breaststroke. This is used by pearl divers, lifeguards, frogs and so forth and so on. Should the swimmer become fatigued, it is restful to swim on the back or float. However, this has one disadvantage in that one cannot see where one is going. [splashes] [yelps] [gurgling] [narrator] Having mastered the theories of swimming, let us select some well-guarded modern bathing resort and try our wings, so to speak. First of all, we must learn to dress in the average beach locker. [narrator] In addition to actual swimming, it is well to remember that as many, if not more, healthful benefits can be derived from relaxing on the warm, dry sand and basking in the health-giving rays of old Sol. [pops] There are still a few who are foolish enough to eat a hearty meal immediately before going into the water. To avoid the possibility of being stricken with cramps, one should wait at least an hour or more. Cramps, as you know, are muscular contractions which seemingly tie the tendons into knots. In the event that you are seized with these muscular contortions... ...do not become panic-stricken. Lie perfectly still. Always remember the scientific fact that the human body is lighter than water. Therefore, making it absolutely impossible to sink. Diving is an exact science and should never be attempted without expert instruction. Therefore, with the aid of the chart, we learn the correct form and mechanics of diving. Observe how the board is set into motion by the springy step of the approach run. How the crouch is timed to the oscillation of the springboard so as to launch the diver easily into the jack-knife, the half gainer, the swan dive or many others too numerous to mention. Now, together with the chart, let us put these theories into actual practice. Only the analytical eye of the slow-motion camera can capture the grace and beauty of diving. [board reverberating] [thumps] [narrator] Now, like a feather in the breeze, glide smoothly into that masterpiece of motion, the graceful swan dive. [clattering] It is customary to have the pool filled with water. [narrator] Ah! Surf-bathing! [pops] [clattering] [thudding] [narrator] As the setting sun slowly dips into the azure blue of the western sea... [sizzling, bubbling] [Hawaiian music plays] Reluctantly, we close on this tranquil scene with the firm conviction that everyone should learn how to swim. - [in Italian] Goofy. - Hooray for Goofy! Goofy. [in Italian] [girl translating] My favourite is Goofy because he is forgetful like me. [boy translating] He's a bungler and he's always kicking up a row. [girl translating] I like Goofy very much because he's silly. I like Goofy because he's silly like me. [boy translating] I prefer Goofy because he's crazy. [narrator] "How to fish". Successful angling no longer depends upon fishermen's luck. For today, fishing has become a truly fascinating science. [clears throat] When to fish can be determined by the astrological signs of the zodiac, whose countless stars and planets control all the tides of the earth's waters. Hence, when Neptune enters the constellation of Pisces, or Fishes, the cosmic vibrations create in the fish an uncontrollable desire to bite. When the earth enters this celestial orbit, it too falls under the powerful influence of these vibrations. Now, let us observe the effect of this phenomena on man. Dormant within his bosom slumbers an inert instinct to fish. This desire becomes acute only through bodily contact with the cosmic undulations of Pisces or Fishes. This creates a mental malady known as "fisher's februs", or fishing fever. During this trance-like period, the angler checks his fishing tackle, and succumbs to an overwhelming desire to test his casting skill. A deft flick of the wrist, whip of the pole, the tug of the line and the angler can easily imagine a fighting fish in a crystal pool. "Where to fish". Ah, the beauty of the sunrise o'er high, rugged mountains. The freshness of the early-morning dew. [thundering] The joy of sleeping in the great out-of-doors. The fisherman awakens at the crack of dawn, deeply impressed with this closeness to nature. [back popping] Ah, to breathe deeply of that pure, rarefied mountain air. "The trout". The mountain trout is an alert, intelligent creature. A fighter of the first water. Rugged, strong, daring. [snarling] His dauntless fortitude makes him absolutely fearless. [gasps] "How to approach the stream". - Slip up quietly... - Shh! ...between shrub or bush, and don't let the fish see you coming. Whoo! Uh-oh! Now you've done it. Once the pool is disturbed, the fish can never be enticed to bite. [snapping] "Fly fishing". The fly fisherman must know how his tackle, and other objects, appear to the fish. Therefore, through the eyes of the fish, we view the angler. The tempting fly. And study carefully the reaction of the fish. [chortling] The lure is scientifically designed. When dropped into the water, the resulting optical illusion creates a very realistic effect. [conga music plays] To cast the lure, select a spot free from overhanging brush and limb. Swing the arm with a liquid, rhythmical motion. Straight as an arrow, the lure spins over the water to land, lightly, into that deep, purple pool. The perfect catch! The line sings and the poor fish is really hooked. "Lake fishing". Immortalised in the words of the ancient bard. Quote: "Upon yon lake's calm, placid breast, the angler plies his yawl to tempt a smile from Lady Luck, where'er his hook may fall". Unquote. - [fishing line whirring] - Uh-oh! A strike, a strike! Oh, boy, what a whopper! Look at that pole bend! Hear that reel sing! Don't give him any slack! Play him! Keep cool. Don't get excited. Here he comes! There he goes! Keep cool! Use your head, use your head! Keep your eye on him! Wow! Look at him go! Oh, boy! Keep calm, now. Brace yourself. Ah! We've landed him! Watch it, now! Watch it! Don't let him get back in the water! Truly, no pride is so justifiable... [gasps]...as that of a successful fisherman. [bubbling] - [in German] Germany loves Goofy. - I love Goofy. Goofy is really great. [in German] [girl translating] I think Goofy is funny. If he is laughing, I have to laugh. [chuckles] [boy translating] I like Goofy's voice. [girl translating] Goofy's cool because he's funny and he has that goofy look. [boy translating] I like Goofy most because when he's slipping, he always screams. - [screams] - [Goofy screams] I think that's funny. [narrator clears throat] Skiing is fast becoming the most popular of all winter sports. And small wonder, for there is no finer conquest than that of a mountain clad in its glorious winter mantle of glittering white. [snoring] Skiing, pronounced "sheeing", is a sport that appeals especially to the rugged, wide-awake, out-of-doors individual... [alarm blaring] [clears throat] ...who leaps from his bed at sun-up, in joyous anticipation to the thrills that lie in store for him. The first essential is the correct equipment. Of primary importance is the undergarment. Either one or two-piece, rock-ribbed, pre-shrunk and form-fitting. The skis, er... "shees", should be made of seasoned hickory, and free from knotholes and termites. Mmm-mmm. The shoes should be box-toed, large enough for at least two pairs of socks, yet comfortable enough to wiggle your toes. - Slightly. - [squeaking] - And now... Now... - [snoring] Now! The choice of a sweater should reflect the taste of the true sportsman. In other words, studied carelessness. For, after all, clothes do make the man. Now, we are completely dressed. [narrator clears throat] With the exception of the trousers! The trousers should be light, snow-repellent, with a hard, smooth finish. They should fit snugly, yet allow plenty of room at the hips, shoulders and the knees. Now we are all set and ready to conquer the heights. - [indistinct yodelling] - [narrator] Ode To A Mountain. Quote: "Oh, kingly mountain, draped in royal raiment white, with countless jewels bedecked in dazzling splendour, yet silent as the night". Unquote. Oh, yes. If you should smell something out of the ordinary, don't be alarmed. It is only fresh air. [yodelling continues] Upon reaching the summit, our first step is the turn into position. This is accomplished by the kick turn. One: Knees and skis close together. Two: Firm support on both poles. Now, a decided kick of left leg and ski, forward and high. Three: Bring ski down parallel, but with the point facing in the opposite direction. Four: Swing the other ski around and drop it parallel to the first ski. This is really quite simple and can be easily mastered by the greenest amateur. This is indeed fortunate. [clears throat] How, technically, to get up. First, get the "shees" together. Place them parallel and across the down slope to prevent slipping. Then, place both poles across your body. Now, pull your skis under your body and gently push up. You are now in an upright position. For the first attempt, choose a gentle slope. We start with a joyous Gelandesprung, or hop. And we are off! [drumroll] Always keep the eyes to the front, because objects sometimes appear with amazing suddenness. Skiing is really quite simple once you get the hang of it. The most popular method of ascent is the herringbone, used on short climbs, but not on too steep a slope. The name "herringbone" is derived from the neat, symmetrical pattern left in the snow. Now to change direction at high speed. First, the jump turn. This looks difficult. Once learned, however, it becomes extremely simple. [indistinct yodelling] The schuss, or downhill run. It is the quickest way to get to the bottom. It is so named because of its peculiar sound. - Schuss! - [whooshing] - [thumps] - [Goofy screaming] The slalom, or downhill racing through flags, should only be attempted by an expert skier. [indistinct yodelling] And now that thrill of thrills, the ultimate goal of every ambitious skier. The ski jump! [screaming] Ever faster and faster, a virtual human bullet. Ah, the exhilaration of it. The flight through the air with the grace and beauty of a bird on the wing. Perfectly balanced, complete master of his own destiny. [wind gusting] [glass shattering] [snores] [narrator] After a vigorous day in the open, the skier never has any trouble falling to sleep. [indistinct yodelling] [in various languages] - Bye! - Goodbye. - Bye from London. - Bye from Milan. - Goodbye from London. - Bye-bye. Goodbye.
