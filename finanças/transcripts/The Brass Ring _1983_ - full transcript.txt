[MUSIC PLAYING] -Banker, your payment for $200. -That helps. Now I can buy Vendor Avenue. -Damn, there goes my monopoly. -You're crazy. MERLE: I am not. You'll go broke if you use every last penny to buy property. RON: There are no pennies in Monopoly, stupid. -I don't like that word. -You mean monopoly? -You know the word I mean, Merle. -Do you have any change? MERLE: Well, we're not mind readers, mother. -What do you know about mind reading? MERLE: Nothing. -You know the word I mean. DIANE: Merle, would you move? MOTHER: I don't have to spell it out for you. -You're not the only one here you know. -Sorry. RON: You rolled a six. -Well, that's it. I'm out. RON: Ha ha. -Well, now you can fix up your property even more than it is. -My property, that's a funny joke. They'd love to get their hands on m, property. if they could. -Don't talk like that, mom. Are there any utilities left? -Hey, you want to play or not? -Well? RON: It's your roll, mom. -At least I can live on luxury tax. MERLE: Hi. -Broad daylight and there are lights on all over the place. And I'm the one who pays the electric bills. -It's your roll, Ron. Go ahead I don't-- -No one else cares. -I don't think you could avoid until the end. -Yeah, well I ain't planning on paying, why you even worrying. -You will pay what you sold. RON: Snake eyes. one, two-- ha ha, chance. Rich uncle dies, inherit $200. -I'm still the banker. -Yeah well, I thought you were out. -Well, come on. You've got doubles. Throw now. -Oh crap.

MERLE: Clean it up, Ron. -Well, I guess I have to be lucky at something. MERLE: Clean it up. -Do you mind? This is my newspaper. I'd like to read it in peace. -There's a Clint Eastwood film playing at the Queen's Plaza, but-- -You're not going to help around the house this weekend either. Just going to drag those kids off to a movie again. At least pay me the rent you owe me. It's the middle of the month. -Well, that's tough. I can't pay it! -Well, you're not leaving this house until you do. -If you think you're going to lock a grown person in a room you've gotta be crazy. -I'm not the crazy one in this family. MOTHER: Oh no? -What did you say to me? Now you get something straight. This is my house. I live here and you've got to learn to cooperate. MERLE (VOICEOVER): Mama's been fine all spring. Really. But she's had three nervous breakdowns since Diane was born and she had to be put away. But she's doing OK now. Her skin's cleared up. She can remember everything. -It's not my fault if you can't manage your money properly. Elaine please, give it to me. -I don't have it. -I don't believe you. MERLE (VOICEOVER): She's even held a job for almost six months now. -You give me back that! You keep your filthy hands off that! Give that to me! MERLE (VOICEOVER): Sometimes it's like being on a Merry-Go-Round. The mom keeps reaching out. She's always sure the next time around she's going to get the brass ring. -What are you hiding? Elaine, is that your medicine? -What's in my purse is my affair. -Haven't you been taking your pills? -What pills? -Don't play games with me. Tell me if you've been taking your pills. -(ANGRILY) I don't have to tell you! -Do we have to go through this again? Please. -If I didn't hide everything, you'd take everything that I had. -Let's-- just try to calm down. -It's mine. I earned it. I did it myself. -Let's try to-- -Don't touch me! You keep away from me. Come on, kids. Let's get out of here. -(WHISPERING) I give up. I give up. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "THIS TIME"] DIANE: Shouldn't we call grandma? -No. -At least to let her know where we're going. -(ANGRILY) No! -This place near grandpa's grave? -It's near enough. We're going to be on our own land now. Daddy will know where to find us. DIANE: Yes, grandpa's dead. (ANGRILY) Don't you ever, ever, say such a thing again. MERLE: What about your job, mom? -I haven't thought of that-- -Are we going to back by Monday? Hello. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "THIS TIME"] -Get out of here. -This is Charlie. -Oh honey, he's lovely, but he's too big. Now you go get something smaller. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "THIS TIME"] Kids, get out of the way. -Do you think they've got a big pool here, something like public or a lake? -Well, I could use some coffee. MERLE (VOICEOVER): I can't believe it. My Mother's run away from grandma. All the way to a place in New Hampshire called Lunar Lake. Grandma may be worried, but mom sure isn't. I really can't believe it. RON: Taxi! (OUT OF BREATH) Taxi! DIANE: There's a bug in the bathroom. -Did you wash your hands? -(READING) Tomorrow. See property. DIANE: Where is it? -Down on the ground. -Hello. Sir. Sir. -Hello. May I help you? -I need a hammer. -What kind? -A hammer. -OK. We've got lots of hammers here. I'm sure you can find one that you might like. Which one would you like? -The cheapest will be fine. We're just going to pound in a few tent stakes. Oh, and I need a well. We have property out by the lake. -Artesian? -I beg your pardon? -You want a well with a pump or an artesian? -Cheapest will be OK. -How about this one right here? -It's now awfully big. -I think it'll serve it's purpose a bit. OK. MOTHER: Oh and I need a latrine. -I suggest you buy this and dig the latrine yourself. All you need is a hole and two footprints and this'll come in handy when you bury your garbage. -Now, about the well. -We'll dig that for you. -Good, but I'll have to show you where and I don't have a car. -Mom, what kind of tent we're getting? -Uh, we need a tent. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "THIS TIME"] [PLAYFUL SCREAMING] -OK, come back. OK, that's good. RON: (EXCITEDLY) I've got this mother bug! DIANE: Great bug! [LAUGHING] MERLE (VOICEOVER): So we've found our own hideaway and the first night, sure enough, the moon came out over Lunar Lake. [ANIMAL HOWLING] -Mom. Mom. -Hmm? -Mom, I had a bad dream. -It's OK, honey. Come on. OK, it's all right. [HUMMING LULLABY] RON: The bathroom's all yours. -Don't peek. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "THIS TIME"] [MERLE SCREAMING] -OK kids, let's get ready. We're going for a nature walk. MERLE (VOICEOVER): Mom's nature walks meant hiking into town to do laundry and buy groceries. We became very fond of the public library. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Come in. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -What are you doing? -Trying to wash my face. -Can I watch? -Sure. Come here. -I'll do it. I'll do it. Gimme. -Knock, knock. What's going on in here? -This is the ladies' room. -Come on, guys. I don't think you realize something. Our dear mother is going wacko. MERLE (VOICEOVER): Sometimes I could kill Ron. He always talks like that when he's scared. I mean ma's been doing OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Where's Marge? -I don't know. -Would you like a chair? -Guess I'll wait outside. -I always wondered why dad deserted mom. Don't you think we should call grandma? We don't have to call her. -Yeah, but we should let her know where we are. RON: Naa let her hunt. We let her know where we are she'll call the cops like she always does. -Yeah, she'll probably guess where we are anyway. RON: Mom, I want to go swimming. -No swimming without a lifeguard. -That's ridiculous. How many people do you know that live by lakes that don't go swimming? -Go to your room, Ron. -Great. -Some day we'll have a lifeguard and our own boat in front of our house. -You don't even have a job. -I don't need a job. Oh smell that air. We're I starting over right here near this beautiful lake, in our own wonderful winery. This land is ours forever and ever, I promise you. MERLE (VOICEOVER): Dear grandma, we're all OK here at camp Lunar Lake. Please don't tell mom that I wrote you. RON: You know mom, comics are a good investment. A Marvel Comics number one is worth $16,000. Wish I had one. -Firstly it bills character. -Hi. I brought you Sunday dinner. Pot roast and apple pie. -(ANGRILY) You're not allowed to speak to any of us. -Come on outside kids and we'll set up a picnic. MOTHER: It's probably poison. My kids aren't having any. -I think they will. Come on kids. -Nobody wants you here. -I don't believe that. -Well It's true. Leave. (ANGRILY) You are not wanted here! Get it? Now nobody needs you. The kids don't need you. We do not want you here. I'm going to call the police. -(LAUGHING) Oh yeah, I'm sure you have a princess telephone. Now come on kids. Come on Merle. Come on Ron. (FRANTICALLY) Elaine, what are you going to do? You can't handle this. You can't handle this. You're going to run out of money and the kids have to go to school. -(ANGRILY) Stop it! It's going to be the same old story. We've been through this before. -Just stop it! -You can't expect your kids to take care of you. -Leave us alone! (PLEADING) Elaine, please! Well, anybody who wants to come home with me is welcome, but I'm leaving right now. MOTHER: Well, I hope you've learned your lesson. You can't touch me here. My father's spirit lives in that lake and I know you're afraid of his power. MERLE (VOICEOVER): Well I don't think writing grandma was such a great idea. DIANE: Can I have some applesauce? [VIDEO GAME SHOOTING] -Hey, you like that book? -Yeah. -Oh. Who's it by? -Um, Katherine Mansfield. -Do you live around here? I haven't seen you. -We're staying down at the lake for the summer. -Yeah, it's nice around there. -Yeah, it's really nice. Especially compared to New York in this department. -You live in New York? -Yep, the Big Apple. And you come from Brooklyn? -Actually I come from Bransyn. My father's cable company that he works for moved here about a year ago. What's your name? -Merle. MOTHER: Where's Merle anyway? -I gotta go. Um, uh bye. -Will I ever see you again? -Maybe. -That's all right. I think we can handle it. Um Marge! -Busy? -Huh? -I've got a question. -Yeah? -I'm thinking of renting a place in town this fall. -Is that so? -Nothing too expensive. -The old Claverley place is for rent. -Claverley place? -Yeah. Between Boardwalk and Park Place. -Of course it ain't furnished. -Well, that's no problem. We have furniture. -Do that again honey and I'm going to take your head off. He does that once more, I'll take his head off. RON: It's probably haunted. [MERLE MAKING OMINOUS SOUNDS] DIANE: Come on, don't do that. [LAUGHING] Come on. MOTHER: It's got a very good view. It's got a nice porch. Well, what do you think Merle? -I think it's dirty. RON: Well, no self-respecting cockroaches living here. DIANE: This is gross. -It's big. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [WATER DRIPPING] -We'll take it. [MUSIC PLAYING] MERLE (VOICEOVER): It took us about two minutes to move in and two days to decide where to put a cot, two lawn chairs and an ice chest. But it was fun. RON: No, no, no. I don't want one. -Well, you can't just have fruit loops for lunch. -Why not? -Can I have some more raisins? -Merle, I like your little swinging outfit. Trying to make a big impression on your first day of school. Hey ma, where are you going? -Job hunting. Since you kids are going to be in school, I'll be free to go and look for work. Not to many people know. It's a lucky thing now. Um, hand me my purse. Will you, Merle? -Here you go. -Oh damn. -What's wrong? -Well, look at that. The strap's broken. [LAUGHING] What were you guys laughing at? -It's been broken for two months, ever since you and grandma had your little uh, shouting session. -Don't you think that's funny too? -Get the stupid thing fixed. -Thanks for the advice, Ron. Advice is free after all. -Cut it out. What did you want me to say, ma? -Oh that's all right. Go ahead and laugh at your mother. I don't care. -Maybe the shoe store fixes purses like that. -I'll get it fixed. Your mother can look after herself. Don't you worry, honey. Now, how about a hug? Aw. -Does purple look good on me? -Yeah, it looks good. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] -So uh, how do you like it here, Myrtle? -My name is Merle. -Ok, uh M? -E, R, L, E. -I hope you'll be happy here. It's not New York, but we're friendly. -Um-hmm. -I've uh, never been to uh, New York. I've been to Los Angeles. What's it like, uh Merle? -You want to know what New York is like? -Uh, no. Your home room now, is uh 202 and uh your adviser is Miss Finnegan. -Uh-huh. -We're all here to help ya and you just let me know if there's ever anything I can do for you. MERLE: All right. -Let me help you. -You new? -Yeah. -Yeah, I thought so. We don't seem to get many new kids here. Everybody just stays. -Are you in room 202? -Yeah. Come on, I'll take you. Oh hi, Angela. How are you doing? She's really nice. -Yeah, she seems nice. Hi Mrs. Ed, how are you feeling? She's our home EC and drivers ED teacher. She's really nice. Some of the kids call her fried EC, but we don't say it in front of her. -I don't know how I'm going to remember everybody. -Don't worry you will. You will. Oh, where do you live? -16 Maple Street. -Oh yeah. I heard somebody moved in there. The Clockery house. [LAUGHTER] -No the Claverley Place. -Oh yeah, Claverley Place. Yeah Claverley Place. -I got Mr. Walden. -Oh he's the one that stinks. [LAUGHTER] MERLE: He's got rivers under his arms. -Can I borrow your lip gloss? MARY: Cheryl, I like you and everything but your Kleenex flowers are terrible. Why don't you do the food and let Tony do the decorations? -But I was food last year. -Hi. -Oh hi, Darlene. DARLENE: How are y'all doing? -Fine. How was your summer? -Oh my father just got a new boat and we went roller skating a lot. You guys look great! -Thank you. -Oh got to go. Have fun. Bye. -Bye. I hate that girl. You want to do lights? -I'm not sure if I'm going. I don't know how to roller skate. -You can fake it. Be there Friday night, 7:30, at the Pavilion. -I don't even have skates. -Everybody's going to rent. -Yeah that's right. -Mm-hmm. -Hi. -Hi. -He told Jane that he liked you and Darlene was sitting right there. -Really? -I thought Ricky was going with Darlene. -Well where have you been all summer? [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] -Come on, you guys. MERLE (VOICEOVER): Well, I think I'm really going to like it here. [CAR HORN HONKING] DIANE: The teacher, she asked us all our names and uh, she remembered all of them. After a while she couldn't remember a single one and so we started to call her no name. RON: You got a letter from grandma. It's registered but he let me sign for it. -I wonder what she wants. She says she's worried about us and she wonders why we haven't made any contact with her. She has a envelope for each of us that's stamped. Here we go and there's a dime in each one of them in case we've got to call her collect. That's it. MOTHER: Hello. DIANE: Maybe we should call her. -Good idea. I volunteer you. -Forget it. MOTHER: I'm home! (EXCITEDLY) I got the job! Let's celebrate. I work for the Peerless Feed and Grain company. -(SARCASTICALLY) They pay you in oatmeal? -It's a bonus and it's good for us. -We can't eat it. It'll turn us into horses. -We can make all kinds of things out of it. DIANE: (SOLEMNLY) I can hardly wait. -Like um, well like meatloaf and, and cookies, and oh and probably muffins. RON: (SARCASTICALLY) And oatmeal mache boots come winter time. -(HAPPILY) I got my own office. Oh It's tiny. It's a little cubicle. It doesn't have any windows, but it's all mine. I'm so happy. I'm working! I'm earning money! -(WHISPERING) Thank God. RICKY: Hey, how are you doing? -Not too good. I can't find my notes to the history test. Goddammit. Sorry. -Fine. You still live near Lunar Lake? -Yeah. Here they are. So test me on the bottom half questions right over here. [CLEARING HIS THROAT] -In the early 1700s almost all the work in the world was done by human hands. A yes, B no, C maybe. -Um, B? -Hmm. All right, you don't know.

She's nice, but she's still a mother. -Yeah, I know what you mean. -She's a terrible cook, so if she offers you any food you're allowed to say no. -Honey, why don't you pass these rice crispy bars to Merle. -Thanks. Could I have some milk, please? -Ma, are you sure you make this recipe right? These things look kind of weird. -You're terrible. [LAUGHTER] How are you enjoying our little town, Merle? -It's nice.

Let's see it. We've got to fix the arm. Put it on. I'd love to teach you how to crochet, Merle. -It's easy. -If Mary can do it, anybody can, but she's going to be an antique before she finishes this. -I'll be too big for it when it's done anyway. -If I were you, I'd be thinking about getting smaller not bigger. -I was thinking about my bust. -(TEASING) What bust?

Bill likes me in pastels. He says it lights up my face. RICKY: Bill's playing? I heard he was benched. -Benched? He's one of the best football players on the whole team. He certainly won't be benched for the homecoming game. -So why did he get benched? DARLENE: Well, they went to those parties and-- -He got drunk and called the coach. -It was funny. You should have been there. -Oh, I'm sorry. I'm still in junior high school. -Oh, If I see you, uh, I'll wave to you from my float. -Merle and I will wave too. I'm taking her to the dance.

RON: Yeah, mom used to like everything. DIANE: No she doesn't. -Oh no? And you do moves only. -She promised. -Ah, big deal she promised. -She really promised. -There's no difference, besides what promise has she ever kept? -It's not her fault she can't keep a promise. I mean she doesn't do it on purpose. It's just something she does. DIANE: But she promised. -Grow up, kid. -Move your feet please. What are you trying to do? Cut it out. Stop throwing those dirty clothes at me. -It's Saturday night. Why don't you go out or something? Got to the movies. -Because I've got a lot of problems.

Of course I remember. Has anybody been telling you I don't remember? Is that it? MERLE: No mom. -I remember. Merle. MERLE: Yeah. -There are certain rules about boys in this house.

It's yours. -Shut up, Ron. -You lived in Queens? -Mm-hmm. -Um, we originally lived in Brooklyn. My father's cable company sent him here. -His father worked for a cable company. -Hey, do you think they can get us a free TV? MERLE: Well, uh we'll see you later. -Nice meeting you. Bye. I got you white. I figured it would go with anything. -Oh. -Your mother is very nice. -Yeah. -She smokes a lot. -She's trying to cut down. [MUSIC PLAYING] -That's good punch. MARY: Good evening, Mr. Hall. CHERYL: Hi Mary. MARY: Hi Cheryl. Oh, would you like a beverage? CHERYL: Sure. -Come on. Let's go. -No. -Hmm? -I want to look at the stars. Don't you like to look at the stars? -Sometimes. -Is that the big dipper over there? -No, that's not it. That's it over there. -Then, what's that? -I don't know. No, that's the milky way. That's the big dipper. -No, the milky way is a long band. That's the big dipper. The big dipper is a pot and the milky way is a long band. I don't know what that is over there though. -Sometimes when I am depressed, I look at the stars and think of all the little people on the stars. -Little people? MERLE: Yeah. In each star is a world and we're one star. It's just that there's so many worlds. You know how tiny we really must be? -Come on, Darlene. Let me explain. -No, just get away. -Please, let me explain. -Get away from me. Leave me alone. MARY: Here, you want to have some of my mother's punch? -Yeah. [COUGHING] -How do you like it? -It's awful. -Yeah, it is. -Hi. Hi. How are you? Your dress is really nice. -Thank you. Here, try some of the punch my mother made. -How do you like it? -It needs something. -Sure, something. -I have to tell her not to make any more. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "COULD HE BE THE ONE"] MOTHER (VOICEOVER): Merle. I know all about the boys. Small town boys are no different. Just be very careful. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "COULD HE BE THE ONE"] -Come on-- -Excuse me, I've got to go do something. -Merle, if you see Ms. Eckard anywhere, can you tell her I'm here at the punch bowl? -Don't listen to that guy with that big empty space where his brain used to be. -Shut up. You don't have to be mean. -The guy's a joke, Dar. -I know that, Ricardo. -So then why do you hang out with him? -I'm just trying to make you jealous, you big idiot. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Would you wait. Come on. Let me explain. -Why? -Just come outside. I'll explain. Wait a minute. Just listen to me. I mean Darlene had a very rough time tonight. [MUSIC JOHANNE BLOUIN, "COULD HE BE THE ONE"] -Mom? -Shh. Quiet. -Do we have any Aspirin? -Where? No. -Yeah right. Well, I have a really bad headache. Are you sure we don't have any Aspirin? MOTHER: No! No! [MOTHER RAMBLING LOUDLY] MOTHER: Don't tell me how to spend money. I heard you! Just because I'm broke right now you think you can treat me like dirt. Don't you threaten me. I can take care of myself. I can take care of my kids. They'll never turn on me. Never! You poisoned them! You'll never poison them. We are protected. Keep away! Get away! Get away from me! Merle, go upstairs they're very near and they're going to get me, but I'll keep them away from you. You go upstairs. (CRYING) My God, they're going to kill me. They're going to kill me! Go! Get upstairs! [LOUD CRYING] MERLE: What do we do now? RON: Set her up in the living room and sell tickets. MERLE: Stop it. MOTHER: I'm warning you. Stay away from me. Stay away from me! MRS. HAUSER: Merle, whatever it is, if there is something you need to talk about it's OK. Honey, what's wrong? Are you sick? Has something happened to you and you want to tell me about it? I'm a great listener. -(SADLY) My mother is going crazy. MRS. HAUSER: Aw. [LAUGHING] Mary probably says the same thing about me. -No. She's having a nervous breakdown. I mean, she thinks people are hiding in the house. She's had one before, but My grandmother was there to help us out. -Where is she? Where's your brother? Where's your sister? -They're home. I mean she's not hurting anybody or anything. She's going crazy and she just won't stop. -Do you think we ought to call a doctor? -She'll kill me. I mean, when my grandmother called an ambulance she didn't talk to her for three years. Now they still don't really talk that much. MRS. HAUSER: Well, don't you think we need to do something? -Yeah. I guess this must be about the worst night in your life. -Yeah. MRS. HAUSER: Well um, let's go into the kitchen and a make a few telephone calls. MERLE (ON PHONE): Hello grandma. It's me. I'm calling from a neighbor's house. Yes, I think you better do that. -No more crime. Never. Never. They're watching me. No way! Oh my God! No crime! No crime! [POLICE SIREN BLARING] -Hello. Is Merle Carlson here? -Yeah. That's me. I have some papers I need for you to sign. My grandmother will sign them she will be here in a little while. [MOTHER SCREAMING AND CRYING] SOCIAL WORKER: Excuse me. I need you to sign this. -What? -I need your signature. -Oh uh, yeah. Oh hey, can I have a pen please? [CAR ENGINE STARTING] -Merle, I'll um-- I'll get you some breakfast just as soon as I can. Your rooms are all ready and a lot of your friends have been calling. I-- I had all your clothes cleaned. -She had a good job grandma. She was doing just fine. -She-- she was a double entry bookkeeper. One of the best. The Weavers had a new baby. They want you to babysit. Is it a girl? GRANDMOTHER: (LAUGHING) Another boy. Mark. There's a stack of mail for you from the Fruit of the Month Club. How'd they get your name? -Grandma. -She wouldn't take her medicine. There isn't anything anyone can do if she won't take her pills. That's about it. -I'll get my things. -Good girl.
