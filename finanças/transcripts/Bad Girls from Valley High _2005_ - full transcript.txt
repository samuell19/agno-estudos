This section of the lot is for Huns only, enema head! Hey, Drew. Charity's old locker? Mr. Douglas said that a year was enough. I guess they're short on space. I believe this is my locker. Hi, I'm Katarina. It's ni-- it's nice to meet-- it's very nice to meet you. Um... This is yours, so I guess-- okay. I hope I didn't upset him. It's because you're in his late girlfriend's locker. Late? When will she be here? No, she meant late as in dead. - Hey, babe. - We broke up. - Remember? - Oh yeah. Well, look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call you a spoiled slant-eyed bitch. It was in the heat of the moment. Come on, T, you know I still love you anyway, right? Yo, G Dog, what's up? - Get your dick mittens off me, spooge. - Okay. - Hi, Danielle. - Hi, wart. Don't you love her cool nickname for me, huh? - Hi, Jonathan. - Yo, Brooke. - Wanna have lunch today? - Yeah, I'd love to! Is Danielle gonna be there? Later. Hey, you bros ever need exam notes or a paper done or you want to scratch some vinyl at my crib, I'm your homey! Hi. How you doing? Good morning, Mr. Chauncey. Hello, Danielle, Tiffany and Brooke. Hi, Drew. Before we get started, I want to introduce a new exchange student. Katarina Wolfson. - Whoo! - Settle down! Miss Wolfson, would you mind telling the class a little about where you're from? I grew up in Romania, in a very small and poor town called St. George. The population is 375-- just make it 374 because I am here. Um, well... my mother told me, "In America, if you study hard, be honest and always do the right thing..." "...everything will be fine." That's it. Thank you, Katarina. By the way St. George is in the province of Transylvania, whose main export other than the Dracula myth is chocolate. My personal favorite is the cherry-filled chocolate crucifixes at Eastertime. Ew. Our next assignment will be "The Merchant of Venice." Yes! Who? I'm sure all of you-- Good morning, students. This is Principal Douglas. As you all know, it was one year ago today that one of our students, Charity Chase, passed away. For those of you still struggling with your grief, Dr. Turner will be having crisis counseling in room 105 this period. Any interested student is hereby excused from class. Also, don't forget the big pep rally! Read the first two acts for Wednesday. - We should go. - Why? Because it's gonna look weird if we don't. Okay. And will the party responsible for fire-bombing my car please report to my office immediately? You're not-- you're not gonna go with them? I didn't know the girl. Well, neither did the rest of them. Not really. Please, if I'm not prying, how did she die? They say she committed suicide. They? Not you? Hey, yo, my people, I'll slip you some guts. My idea of hell is being in a room with that dork for five minutes. How long is the MC Wart persona going to last? I give it till the end of the week. What's with this multiple personalities? It's because he doesn't have one. Oh, Charity! Remember, time heals all losses. Next! Oh, get over it! So, where's Drew? Probably in the classroom with the new girl. Holy-- Where the hell are they? I believe that's them out there. I'm just going to the nurse's office. Hey! Hey. You guys are late. Oh, like they're not gonna be old anymore? Brooke had to get her lip waxed. It took longer than we thought. - So, how are you holding up? - I'm okay. It must have been weird, it being the one-year anniversary and all. Yeah, I have to admit it was pretty - hard, but-- - If you need anything, I'm here for you. So, I'd better get to my stroke victim. Don't want Mrs. Witt to think I flaked on her. Can we have an orderly to room 103 for body removal? Wow! - Do you have to get special training for that? - For what? To run bullshit so effortlessly. It's a gift. So, did he seem a little down to you? - Hello! Dead girlfriend! - Hey, girls! Hi, Danielle. - I'm on bathing detail today. - Ugh! Yeah! See you in the break room. Not! God, I hate the way this place smells. Why'd you pick old people for this community service project? And why are we here again? Because you're helping me get what I want. And when I get what I want, I'm happy. And when I'm happy, I'm not a bitch. Surf's up, Winnie. I'd like to introduce you to Gary Pease who'll show us the art and science of gourmet gardening. Let's go find Gary. He's in the garden right now. - Hello, Gary. Fabulous zucchini. - Hi, John. - How are you? - Pretty good. Good to see you. I have to tell you, this is the most beautiful vegetable garden-- Did I wake you? What happened to Mrs. What's-her-name? Did she get bored with your company and leave? So, what do you want to do today? Take a nap? Works for me. Ah... that's better. Sorry, Charity. - He's not coming. - What are you doing here? You've got to learn that only Huns date guys from Hundred Pines. Especially Drew. He's mine. - Tie her hands. - You people are not well. Poor little Charity. Looking for something? Ever see one of those women-in-prison movies? Isn't it a little late for that? Maybe we're going a little too far with this. Jesus, where is she going? Wrong way! Watch out for the fence! Just a minute! What?! I have to tell you something. I was just down at the front desk and I overheard Drew talking to Katarina. Oh God, I can't believe this. Last year, it was Charity Chase with her sad eyes and her dish-mop hair. - We took care of that problem and-- - Shh! What? If she were any stiffer, she'd be in the Petrified Forest. Look. By the by, the three of us stole my father's car when we were 14. At the age of 16, we gave Brooke's next door neighbor's dog Ecstasy. And, as you already know, at the ripe old age of 17, there was that little Charity Chase debacle. Don't you think if she was going to blow the whistle on us she would have done it ages ago? Stop worrying. By the by, if I ever get pickle tits like hers, just shoot me, okay? My dad has a gun. She still pissed about Drew and Katarina? Aren't you supposed to be with Mrs. Fabrizio? You know that stupid machine she's hooked up to? - The heart monitor? - Yeah, well, it started whining. And it was totally annoying. So I unplugged it. The doctors came in and said I should take a little break. How could Drew resist? Killer curves, flawless skin, perfect teeth. - What more could you ask for? - Cherry truffle? - What? - It's Monday. Chocolates from Mrs. Witt's closet. King me. - Queen me. - Eat me! Five's enough. Whitney Houston's husband... umm... what's his name? He is so over. Totally. Tattoos? They're cool in the right places. - Cargo pants. - Oh, stupid. Unless you're from Wisconsin and need the extra pockets for bricks and cheese! Two-parent households. Highly overrated, if you're talking about mine. - Nipple rings? - Oh! - What's with the annoying music? - It's disco day! - Don't you love it? - I'd rather wax my armpits. ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ Burn, baby, burn...

Okay, this is where you make like sweat and evaporate. Bye, Drew. So, to what do I owe this honor? I just thought you might want some company. Drew, I'm sorry about all that stuff with Charity. You know, with me being a bitch and all to her. You were a bitch to Charity? Well, not really a bitch. Just some heated words in gym class. She seemed sweet, even if she wasn't a Hun. What the hell is it with you guys and this Huns crap? Hundred Pines is a high-end housing project. There's not even any pines there anymore. The beavers ate the pines. It should be called Hundred Stumps. Hey, Katarina. What's up? Hi. My name is Gavin Burke. I'm fullback and captain of the football team. Drew used to be the captain, but then he got all sensitive and shit. Now he thinks that jocks are just a bunch of thick-necked Neanderthals, but... Anyway, I'm a solid C+ student, you know? And I have a serious belt in Tae Kwon Do. And I know eight ways to kill a man, so you know, maybe sometime me and you can get together and I can show you some of my... - moves. - Oh my God. Are you okay? I took very, very few lessons in my homeland. So, Drew I'm having my 18th birthday. It's a costume party. It's totally gonna rage. I'd love for you to come. I'm going as a Victoria's Secret model. I don't know. Maybe. - Drew! - Katarina. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi! - You don't have to leave. - Yeah, I do. I'll just be over in the Hun section sucking the nuts out of my dessert. - What's with the limp? - Must have pulled a muscle. Got to remember to stretch after my workouts. What's up with Brooke? She's been that way for a good 20 minutes. What-- Oh God, I am so tired. I almost fell asleep in Mrs. Putman's class. I did. Yeah! You know, maybe it's time we had a little talk with Katarina. Like the one we had at the gorge with Charity Chase? Something like that. Maybe we should try a different approach. And that would be? Well... my mom says that bad medicine goes down easier when you sugar-coat it. - Point being? - Well... maybe we should take her shopping with us tomorrow. Break it to her gently. Try to talk to her as friends trying to do what's best for her. You're such a retard. No... I like that. Like we keep our friends close, but our enemies closer. Is that a map of Asia? Oh, it's some weird freckle outbreak. I noticed it this morning. Okay, where the hell is Heidi? Hi! Sorry I'm late, but I'm still getting used to your streets. Well, I'm excited about going window-shopping with my new American friends. - Window-shopping? - What's that? - You should get it. - It's too much money and I'm on a very small budget.

I think I've lost all circulation in my hands. Okay, this isn't fun anymore. You're gonna tell her in a nice way, right? We spent all day with her and she's actually kind of okay. What the hell is wrong with you? You are a Hun. She will never be anything more than a sheep farmer from Romania. She has to understand that we Huns have rules and boundaries and that certain things are off limits to peasants like her. Like for instance, the Huns Coming Out Ball, the Huns parking spaces, the Huns Invitational, the Huns cafeteria section, - my birthday party and-- - Drew. Yes. Drew. So, is my lesson over? Yeah, it's over. I just realized you must have mycard. Thank you for a lovely day. How the hell did she pull off that switch? Maybe she knows Siegfried & Roy. They're German, aren't they? Do you need socks or a belt with this? It's underwear, bitch. Okay, how in the hell do you lose a car? Maybe Katarina made it disappear like she did your credit card. Ha ha, you so funny. You funny girl! Look, just find the damn car, okay? I gotta pee again. Wait, isn't that it right there? No, I think-- Wait, wait. Oh no, this is it! I'm sure of it. Where the hell is my car? Did I even drive here? Mine, mine! Yes! So much for your little talk. It's just a stupid gym class. Gavin! - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. What? I'm over here. All right, guys, back to the game. Sorry, it's all the fiber bars that I've been eating. All right, everybody, practice is over! Guys, put your balls away! What a bunch of boneheads. What's this say? Did I make the team or not? Maybe you should have your eyes checked. Yeah. Is my name on there or not? Not. But Gavin and I have been working on my splits. Oh my God. Hey, gorgeous. - What's with the towel? - Back off, wart. Your breath is in my airspace. So, what was that all about? Apparently, I've been replaced too. I was supposed to do a French paper for Drew, but now he's decided to let Katarina tutor him. - Where were they going? - It would have to be her place. Drew's house is tented. Silverfish, I think. The girl just doesn't listen, does she? There you go, dear. Good as new. Nurse's office. Yes. Shop class? Oh my goodness. A metal rod?! Whatever you do, don't pull it out. Hmm... Maple. 725... 727... 729... On your mark! What's with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. - I may have. - Come again? Last night, I tried to find Katarina's house. - And? - You're so funny. Her address is the cemetery where Charity is buried. It must have been a mistake. - Are you sure you had the right number? - It was no mistake. 731 Maple. Can I ask you guys something? Sure. Shoot. Has anything strange or weird happen to either of you since Katarina's come to Valley Gorge? No. T, you? Nuh-uh. Why? - Nothing. - Hurdle. What? - Where did that come from? - Keep going. I'm all right. I can't compete with that. She's like Xena. - I think we need to go to plan B. - What's that? I don't know. Never needed a plan B before. All I know is she is ruining everything. My birthday is in less than two weeks and I'm no closer to getting Drew than I was last semester. We have to somehow destroy this bitch! How are we gonna do that? I think I have an idea. Hey! Yo, as salaam alaikum, my brown brother. Mr. Chauncey? Mr. Chauncey? Anyone here? Oh God! Yes, Tiffany. What can I do for you? I wanted to check out one of those digital whatchamacallits with the zoom thingy on it. Yes. I take it you want a camera with a telephoto lens. Yeah. What are you planning to shoot? Oh, wildlife. You know, little squirrels and birds. Dogs. This is a new digital one. It's a 1.5 megapixel, 5X zoom with memory stick and Firewire output. Perfect for long-range photography. I think you'll appreciate the size of this. Fill this out. Name and date, when you're planning to return it. Tiffany? May I ask you something? If it's not too personal. Sure. Just... as a concerned teacher and a friend, I was just wondering how you girls are holding up in the wake of Charity's suicide. W-- uh-- we really miss her. Oh. Foolish question. Of course you miss her. It must be difficult when you don't see it coming. I mean... I certainly didn't. Oh, me neither... I guess. Well... enjoy wildlife. ...in the wake of Charity's suicide. Guilty! Charity. Oh Jesus, he kissed her! That should be me he's kissing! She spends a lot of time down there, just like Charity used to. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm just cold and hungry. Me too. Hey, aren't you on a diet? Lately I haven't needed one. Ow! Oh my God. Please tell me that's not a tooth. Can you believe the stuff they put in candy? I'm totally suing this company. All right already. She loves you, you love her. Just get out of my shot. Thank you. Here's the money shot. Okay, so what we need is to download something that's totally disgusting, perverted and embarrassing and put Katarina's head on it. Ew! Gross! Doesn't the fur get in the way? Okay, let's just rule out animals completely. Stop. Back up. She's a dominatrix? It's perfect. Everyone looks disgusting in latex. Do you think it'll be enough? Would you want to be with Katarina knowing she put baby powder on that guy's ass? So we'll switch faces and post it on the school's website tomorrow morning. Every guy at Valley Gorge High is gonna see it. I want to be there when the first guy comes up to her and asks her for a spanking and a diaper change. She'll be so embarrassed, I'm betting she'll be - on the next bus back to Romania. - I don't like this. It's dirty and underhanded and... it's just cruel. And your point being? What if we try talking to Katarina again? Maybe this time she'd listen. You are so linear. Okay, where the hell is her head? I don't know. Well, can't you upload, upgrade, surf the wave or something? Come on, you're the computer geek. Fix it! I can't fix what isn't there. I mean, look, you can see Drew fine. This is really creepy. What is this girl? The undead? Damn it, T, you must have had your stupid finger in front of the lens. Oh, you mean this one? I gotta pee again. What is that, like, five times in an hour? Hey! I don't keep track how many times you fart in an hour! I gotta go. Hey, Danielle. Gavin! What are you doing here? I'm helping out my old man. He owns the place, remember? What's with the diapers? I'm buying them for my great-grandmother. She's visiting us from Montana. - Really? Where in Montana? - Des Moines. Yeah, I've been there. I need a price check on the econopack of Jumbo Relievers pine scented. So, Danielle... what-- what do you think about maybe me and you going out sometime? What do you mean, like on a date? Sure, why not? You know? Anyway, I kinda dig a more mature woman. What are you trying to say, I look old? Aw, no, well, you know, I mean lately, looks like maybe you've clocked on a few more miles. But don't get me wrong. - That's a turn on. - What do you think Tiffany's reaction is gonna be to all this? See T and I, we have this understanding. I don't tell her anything and she doesn't know anything. You understand? I guess. Hey, Todd, I really need a price check on those adult diapers ASAP. - Oh my God. - Hey, girls. Wassup? - What the hell? - Stupid perfume bottle is leaking? Oh, that's no problem. I'll clean it up. - No, no, no, Gavin! - I got it. Did I wake you? No, I had to get out of bed to answer the phone anyway. Good, because I've been thinking. There's something about Katarina that's not quite right. What are you talking about? Like when the light flickered the first time she came into Mr. Chauncey's class? And the way her image wasn't on the film. And she has Charity's old locker. And she's always at Valley Gorge Park just like Charity. And her address is the cemetery. So, what you're saying is she's... Charity's ghost. Danielle, do you realize how insane that sounds? Look, we caused her death and wrote the suicide note. Now she's come back to get us, and we can either do something about it or let her destroy all of us. You're starting to creep me out. Ow, ow, ow. You girls okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? You look a little pale. Well, except for Tiffany. A little mishap with the self-tanning oil. You're also early. That hasn't happened in four years. People change. No they don't. So, what can I do for you girls? The real reason we came in was, uh, we were, uh, wondering, um, what would cause only part of a picture to photograph? Yeah, like a body with no head? Could be a number of things-- sun flare, a defective chip, dropping the camera. - Ghosting. - Ghosting? It's just a photo term. Oh. I didn't realize you had such a connection with Charity. Charity? How so? Love of photography. She was the president of the A/V club. We knew that. Settle down. Act four, scene one. "We do pray for mercy. And that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy." These are words spoken by the character, Portia. She was a bored, wealthy, young woman who, to amuse herself, created devious and sometimes sadistic little games. Until one day the game backfired and she found herself in a rather painful position - of having to plead for a friend's life. - Oh. I think we can all relate to this character because we have done things in our lives that may have caused another great pain. Shit! What? Okay, let's go. Put it in gear. And close the sun-roof. Great. When the hell did you get glasses? There my mom's. But for some reason they seem to help. You should have put them on before you parked! And by the way, your blinker's been on for the last three miles. My hips are killing me. Oh, I have to rest. My asthma's acting up. Since when do you have asthma? I'm finished. You go on without me. Come on, get off your asses, you wimps! You know I've never actually talked to a real ghost. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you, Katarina/Charity Chase. I'm confused. We all are. Look, we won't be after tonight. Now to prove my point, I just need you to walk through that lamppost over there. - How would I do that? - I don't know. You're the ghost. Look, it's either that or I cut you open to see if you bleed. - Are you for real? - You know, something's been bugging me. If you could come back as anyone you want, why would you come back as pathetically poor and low-class as you were? The weed is a flower whose virtue has not been discovered. Maybe I'm many things, but I can assure you I am not Charity's ghost. Believe me now? Wow, that's creepy. Convinced? Katarina's not mortal. It makes sense, doesn't it? The one-year anniversary of Charity Chase's death and a new girl arrives out of the blue from a far away country at the ends of the earth. - Since when is Romania the ends of the earth? - You mean it isn't? It's so obvious. It's just like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" part two. And they always come back to the place where they died. Why did she come back? To avenge her death. What is she gonna do to us? - She's already done it to us. - What? You're gonna stand there and continue to tell me that nothing strange or unusual has happened to either of you? No aches? No pains? No leakage? No drainage? I mean, look at yourselves! Okay, fine. I'm getting a six-pack and heading to the pep rally. You coming? Let's give a warm beaver welcome to the Valley Gorge High football team and the Valley Gorge High pep squad as they lead us to victory over Central High! And then the optometrist said that I didn't have enough eyelid to cover a contact lens that thick. Remember when I farted in gym class and I said it was because of all the fiber bars? - Mm-hmm. - Well it was, but it wasn't anymore. Oh, my ass has dropped a full six inches. Hell, all of me's dropped a full six inches. I feel like with every minute I grow a year older. I've been wearing adult diapers for two weeks. - Oh. - Ew. - Ahhhh! - B-E-A-V-E-R-S! Beavers! Beavers! We're the best damn beavers! - We're not jammin'... - Are we gonna die? I'm too young to die. You? I have to turn 18 in two days. I look older than Madonna, so shut up already! Oh, this is all your fault! You got us into this, - now you get us out! - It's not that easy, okay? You can't kill a ghost! They're already dead! Now listen, I have watched these movies a thousand times. and there's only one way to get a ghost like Katarina back into the grave. How? We lure her back into the hole with the one person she can't rest without. So, we have to kill Drew so he can be with Charity/Katarina for eternity. Wait. Who are we going to kill? Central High! You know what's weird? I've been having hot flashes and cold spells. And my period, it's practically non-existent. Oh my God, Danny, that sounds like, wait, what's the word? Menopause. Oh, Jesus. I'm not even 18 yet. Katarina screwed us good. I almost wish she'd get it over with and put us out of our misery. Oh, me too. Quit whining, girls. It'll all be over after tomorrow night. The curse will be reversed and we'll be beautiful again. Oh, I feel faint. Oh, I gotta get out. Pickle tits! - Good evening, ma'am. - Hey, Nicole. Oh my God! Is that you, Danny? Oh my God! Who did your make-up? It's so real! Oh my God, it's fabulous! - Yeah, fabulous. - Happy 18! Try it. It's nitrous - Hey! It's not a toy! - Aw, screw you, granny! I can't wait for tonight to be over. - What? - Never mind. ♪ Got a drill to my head, got a monkey in my bed ♪ ♪ Got some breath mints in my hand ♪ ♪ Gotta go work on my tan ♪ ♪ I got eggs over easy and bacon in the pan ♪ ♪ I got bread in my toaster and more breath mints in my hand.... ♪ I thought Gavin was going to learn more songs. - Didn't he? - No, he didn't! He's been playing the same song for like an hour! ♪ We're all rotting ♪ From the inside out ♪ We're all dying - ♪ But isn't death what life's about? ♪ - Gavin! Yeah! Yeah! All right... we're gonna take a little break. Yeah. And then we're gonna come back in 20 minutes and do another song for you. Hey, ladies! - Come on, let's dance. - I don't know. - Hey, you wanna groove? - Get real! - How about you? - Finally! Hey, you all acting like a bunch of old ladies, for real. What the hell are you looking at, Bozo? Oh! - Hey! - Ow! Looking for-- --someone? Danielle! Costumes? Duh! I was actually looking for Drew. Umm... he sent me this and said it was very important that he would see me tonight. Oh my! So where is he? He was here and he was very upset. Said something about him being so rich and you being, well, so poor. And how it'd probably never work out. And he said it was just like Charity happening all over again. He used a lot of buzz-words-- "dying," "eternity," you know, stuff like that. Did he say where he was going? Well, he said he was going home to get a jacket warm enough for the gorge. After that... Oh my God. I must find him! Have a hit of chamomile! Very soothing. We're on! I'll drive! - Do you have the note? - Yeah, yeah... It says all the usual stuff-- disappointment in love, indifference to life, his battle with herpes. I even threw in the guilt he still feels over Charity's tragic suicide and the part he may or may not have played in it. Charity killed herself? Duh! I see they finally fixed the fence. Let's just get this over with. Katarina! I think our human sacrifice has arrived. Katarina! Danielle? I thought you were gonna go as a Victoria's Secret model. - Change in plans. - Where's Katarina? Oh, I'd say about now she's probably at your house discovering you're not home. Then she'll most likely come here to prevent you from committing suicide. You're very distraught, you know? Well, at least that's what her note said. You bitch. Uh, uh, uh! Holy shit! Is that loaded? Yep, it's loaded. Now, if you'll just climb that fence and jump to your death, you'll be saving us all a lot of time and energy which God knows the three of us are very short on. Really, I don't have the right shoes for climbing. Over the fence. Why are you doing this? You really want to know? 'Cause you and me were meant to be together and you were just too blind to see! I mean, Jesus, all you had to do was ask me out again and none of this would have ever happened. I'm free next weekend. Too late. God! Hello! Mouthwash! Now jump. Now look, if you really cared about me, then why would you want to kill me? Because I would sacrifice anything to be beautiful again. Even you. - You're nuts. - Drew! Katarina, run! I mean away. Run away. - What is going on here? - Nothing. So you mean you weren't just kissing her? Katarina, it's not what it looks like. I suppose she had a gun to your head. Come on, let's go. Fluffy! Hey you, Casper, why don't you float over here next to your boyfriend? What is going on here? This... is what's going on. Jesus. You're the ghost of Charity Chase, come back to exact revenge. Oh, not that again! What about Charity's quote? Drew showed me that quote in his yearbook. It's Emerson. Everybody knows that. Okay, you live in a cemetery. What are you talking about? I went there-- 731 Maple? North or south? Screw this! You, quit avoiding the inevitable. Climb the fence and join Charity, - who wasn't even a Hun! - And who we killed. You killed Charity? We sort of all did. - Could you climb the fence now? - Danielle, don't! - This is crazy! - Move! I would have given anything to be a Hun. Jesus Christ! You area Hun! No, I'm not. In reality, I'm no different from Katarina or Charity. My family lived in a trailer park and ate mayonnaise sandwiches three times a day. How did you end up in Hundred Pines? Tri-State Lottery. 56 mil after taxes. That's great. Now move so I can kill Drew. Blood? Ghosts don't bleed, but apparently dirt-poor exchange students from Romania do. Was it possible I had been wrong? That driven by obsession, an overactive imagination and blind jealousy, I had made a mistake about Katarina? And if she didn't do this to us, then who did? - How's that again, ma'am? - It's Romania. R-O-M-A-N-I-A. That near Tacoma? OFFICER Oh, and the captain wants 50 on Bonespur in the third race. Surprised? Mr. Chauncey. - Why? - I'd been watching Danielle and the others. I knew they knew something about Charity's death. I just didn't know to what extent. I did it for Charity, to clear her good name. I loved Charity like a daughter. Not in a dirty sort of way. Did you know she was the best A/V president I ever had? And she didn't just do it to get out of PE or study hall. She did it because, damn it, she loved the job! I waited. I kept hoping Danielle and the others would slip up, and they did. I'm splashing blood all over my rented clown suit. By the way, you failed English. Welcome to "The New Garden." I'm Liz Druitt Those of you who think a deck is just a place to sit and drink beer and swat mosquitoes are in for an eye-opener, 'cause today, we are going to talk with Dr. Sam Bats, head of horticulture at Texas A&M University about how he combined his gardening with his leisure living and made himself a vegetable deck. Let's go meet Sam. - Hi, Sam! - Hi, Liz. How you doing? - Good, how are you? - I'm fine. Sam, you have fabulous zucchini-- My goodness, how you've changed. You don't remember me, do you, Danielle? I'm Mrs. Witt. And I certainly remember you. Oh, poor thing. Barely holding on by a thread, isn't she? Oh... happy birthday-- though I am a couple of days late. Not much to show for 18 years of life, is it? A friend of mine died just last month. She was my roommate when you first came to visit. Of course, we'd known each other for years. Our husbands worked together. She's the one who taught me how to play chess. Oh, she suffered agonies waiting for death. But then, one day, her husband gave her a shot of some kind and it just whisked her straight up to Heaven. For her, death was a blessing. But it isn't always so, is it? Take Charity's death, for instance. Did you know Charity was my granddaughter? I didn't think you did. You see... after my stroke, I couldn't speak. But I could see quite well. And I could hear very well. Which, of course, is how I discovered that you and your friends were responsible for my Charity's death. I asked Estelle's husband to give me an extra large dose of his potion. Of course I had to write it out for him. The dear man. He worked for Denton Chemicals, specializing in biological warfare, aging complexes. I remember how much you enjoy chocolates and these are to die for! The poison was extremely concentrated. Your little friend-- oh, what was her name? Brooke, that's it. She was the only one with any self-control. - Oy. - She only ate a couple of pieces. Otherwise, she'd be lying here with the two of you. My symptoms... completely disappeared. Which is often the case with stroke victims. Youwon't be so lucky. Isn't it silly? Sending for an ambulance when someone is already half dead? I mean, Christ, what's the hurry? We are gathered here to bid a fond farewell to our dear sweet friends, classmates and daughters... So here we are, another rainy day, another funeral. Mine. Oh, and Tiffany's. Must have been a two-for down at the mortuary. On the bright side, I'm rid of that annoyance. Oh, get over it! Who are they? He's still a moron. What's their problem? I mean, I'm the one who's dead. Oh my, look at Brooke. A couple of tucks and a laser peel later. You know, in the right light, she could easily pass for mid-50s. I guess she won't be dating any more seniors. In high school, that is. Okay, I'm sorry, that's just wrong. Our deepest sympathies go out to Tiffany's boyfriend, Gavin, whose broken heart, we are sure, is drowning in endless grief. Remember, my son, in this life and the next, time heals all losses. As we lift our eyes to Heaven, we remand these children back to their Maker for all eternity. Amen. - Danielle, Danielle... - Jonathan! Danielle, I'll always love you! Mr. Chauncey? Mr. Chauncey? Oh my-- oh my-- oh my God! Oh my God! - Danielle? - T? - Can you believe this? - My God! Wait, wait. Where the hell are we? I don't know. But I've got a room just like yours. Who cares where we are? We are young again. It's so totally beautiful! But these rugs have got to go. - Who do you think cleans it? - I'll tell you, from the looks of this place, we're set for eternity. - Wait, you mean-- - Yes. Yes, yes, yes. We're in Heaven! Okay, let's celebrate! You put on some music and I'll go make us some lattes. Uh-oh, I think we've got a problem. No CDs. Don't you dare answer that. Relax. This is Heaven. It's got to be Brad Pitt or Ben Affleck. At the very least, Luke Perry. Hello. These are for you. - What-- - And I brought some tunes. Let's party, huh? What the hell are you doing here? When I was at the funeral, I realized - I couldn't live without you. - This isn't happening! Where are the cute guys? How long exactly were you planning on staying?
