Leo? - I'm back here. - Shit. You know you left a cigarette burning on the table. I'm almost done, come here. - Seriously, Leo. How many hours a day do you spend in here? It's disgusting. - It's the only place I know where I can get some peace and quiet. A little solitude, eh. With no distractions. - Well, how bout an office? - Nah, offices are for bean counters. People who file reports and lawyers, accountants, salesmen. As an artist, you need some ambiance. Some place that nurtures creation. And for you, it's the bathroom? - Exactly. How do you spell embody? E-M-B. There. Ready to go. - So Leo, your medication's on the counter. Do you need anything else? - You know where I can get a peyote button? Relax kid, I'm just kidding. What are you doing right now? - All right, come with me. - What, where? - Come with me, trust me. Come on, just come with me. The hands of time move. A steady beat. I wait. Reflecting on words I spoke. Still kindle the fire within my soul. Now in these final moments, questions everything about you. Everything about me. I wait. Sunshine. Rain in the morning. And you wanna leave San Francisco. - Leo, that was amazing. - Thank you. - Where do you come up with this stuff. - Ah, sometimes the most vivid ideas come from the bowels of ones darkness. Ah, that one I should remember. So how's that work coming along, hm? Am I ever gonna get to see any of those drawings? - Ah, it's garbage. - Talkin' bout, it's garbage? How can you consider yourself an artist and not want people to see your work. - Oh I'm not the artist, you're the artist. - That's where you're wrong. You see what I did in there? You just gotta let it flow. You have it in you. I've seen your work, it's excellent. So you're gonna tell me you're not gonna miss anything about San Francisco? The air, the people, the architecture? You wanna cut and run? I cut and run on my whole life. You wanna cut and run and you don't believe in your own gift when other people around you believe and see that you have a gift and they just want you to be happy. You came out here from back home looking for something. And because it didn't happen overnight, you're looking to run again. I think that you, that's just my opinion. It might be, it might be. - Leo. - What? - I get where you're coming from but. - No you don't, you don't get what you're coming, you set. - No no no, hold up, hold up a second. You don't get where I'm coming from, all right. You're from a completely different generation. I know you're really floaty and flowery and all this stuff sounds great, you know. But I'm 25 years old, you're right. - 25 years old, you have all the answers, don't you? - You didn't think I was 25 years old. - No no. - Hold on. Did you think I was 25 years old once? You think I didn't know everything? I knew nothing, nothing. And once I admitted that I knew nothing, I became teachable. And all I'm trying to do is save you some of the pain that I went through. If you're willing to be teachable. - What? - You do what you have to do. You ever wonder why you came out here in the first place? I mean, you came out here to create. Create your life, create art. To recreate something so completely different than what was dictated to you that it really should be. - I know Leo, it's just, I don't know if that's enough anymore. - I know what's wrong? - What? - You. You just keep getting in your own way. - Okay. - I'll tell you what, I wanna buy it from you. - Buy what? - That drawing. If you don't know what good art is, I do. I'd like to make the investment. - Leo. - I wanna be the first one to own a Robert Matsuda. 300 bucks. - You don't need to do that. - I don't need to do anything. Come on, get the gate. I gotta take a leak. ♪ If these guns were mountains ♪ ♪ You could say they're far away ♪ ♪ Although they are out of range ♪ ♪ You gotta wait a later day ♪ ♪ She's my best friend ♪ - Hey. - Hey, Glen. - Robert, what's up? You need a hand? - Nah, I'm good. - I gotta take it for you. - No, it's really okay. - Piece of cake, I got it. I got it. - All right, thanks. Oh not to the side, this way, this way, this way. - Nah it's okay, we'll just. What you got, it's safe in there? - Yeah, thank you. - Sometimes you just gotta force it in, you know? Fragile stuff. There we go, look at that. Good? - Yeah. - All right, let's go get warm. - All right, thank you. - Yeah, no problem. - Jenny tells me you're headed back east, huh? - Yup. - You excited? - Yeah, yeah I'm excited. - Nice. - I heard they just had a blizzard out there. - Oh, have you seen any protein bars in here? I thought I left it. - I don't know, I would not know. - Um, well, I mean, at least you'll have some opportunities, right? - Yeah, that's one way to look at it. - I mean the economy's bouncing back. Manhattan's a good place to be right now. Even Brooklyn's not bad, I mean, a short commute to the city. - Well actually I'm gonna be in upstate. - Oh. What's that like? - It's cold. - I bet. Well, if you ever need a place to stay in New York. - Hello gentlemen. - Hey. Good to see you. - Hi. - Sorry, sweat all over you. - Hot, sweaty. - Yeah. - Oh how was your party the other night, by the way? Sorry I missed that, I was swamped with stuff. - It was good. - Yeah? - Yeah, it was, it was good. It was really nice that everyone put it together? Last hurrah, huh? Did you behave yourself? - How you felling this morning? I'm feeling great. - Good, good. - Yeah. Well, I will head out. - Feel like getting some take out? - Um. - I feel like Chinese or Thai or something. What do you feel like having? - More Thai than Chinese. Hey. Hey. - Can we talk for a sec? - Hey babe, you want you spice eggplant thing? - Yeah, eggplant's good, thanks. I feel like we should talk about this. - What's there to say? I, I think right now is not really the right time. Hey, can you come here for one second? - And I'm double parked outside. - Is it in your purse? I can't find your purse anywhere. - Hold on. - We'll talk later. - Okay. - Okay? - Sure. - Adolfo, it was a mistake. Mistake my balls, man. You realize what this means, right? - What? - I'm that other guy. I'm the asshole, she's got a boyfriend. - Bro, she's always had a boyfriend. It's all good, my man. - I'm being serious. - I love Jenny, she's a great girl, but you've got her on this fucking pedestal someplace man, you gotta forget about her. Did you sleep with her? - No. Did she blow you? - No. - So nothing really happened. Come Monday, you're gonna be in New York and she's gonna be around here doing whatever the fuck. Problem resolved. - Just forget about it. - Life goes on, bro. On to the next one. - Why do I tell you anything anymore? - Hey, cookie monster, shut up! - Stop. - No. What is the cat's name, Malimar or something, I don't know? - Stop, please. - It's some kind of cookie. Hey, shut up! - Be nice, be nice. - What, it sounds like he's in heat or he's dying or he's both. - Yeah, he's not in heat, he's fixed. I'm just tired of it. It's every single night. Be nice, be nice. - Just one more problem we won't have to worry about on the 14th floor. - Well, what about the next big earthquake. You'll be buried under piles of rubble. - Well it's a good thing we have all these giant parachutes that you brought home with you. Are we taking all these things with us? Yes. - I just thought, maybe you'd give it up by the time we go. Maybe stop, you know, doing the dress up. - It's not dress up. - Okay. - I'm a children's party entertainer. I don't do this for kicks, I make money doing this. - Yeah, I know, I just. I figured it was a fresh start, it was a new beginning and that, you know. It was a chance for you to-- - It's not like I'm a prostitute, I'm a children's party entertainer. I don't need a fresh start. You were the one who last week, you said that I make kids happy. What happened to that? I know you make kids happy, it's just that. - You change your mind so fast, and excuse me, do you do this at the office, 'cause uh? No, I don't take my pants off at the office. - What did you do, there's stuff in there? It's just, it's just a pair of headphones, here. - You hurt my feelings. I don't like it when you call it dress up. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it, okay? You know that I really do love what you do for the children. If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm serious. It's always been that way. Have I ever not supported you? I always have. I just don't want to see you wasting your time. - I'm not wasting time. - I know you're not, I just. I think about this new place, you know, it's a new beginning. For you and for me. I mean, we can really start a life. It's not just shuttling back and forth, and I thought that maybe with a new life you'd want to start a new career, too. - Okay, I'm happy doing this and I'm going to school, so, you don't have to worry about my career yet, all right? - What's R-I-T? - Oh, it's, I don't know, it's Robert's thing. It's his college or something. - Come here. I'm sorry, okay? I am. I just know how much potential you have and, just want to make sure that, you know. When you're ready, you're ready. I'll be here, okay? - Suck up. - That's right. - Hi. - Hi. - You live here? - Yeah, no. - Yeah, no. I don't live here. - Okay, where are you going? - Um, up, stairs. - Okay. - Where are you off to, today? - Well, I'm visiting this guy I take care of. The third floor. - Yeah, what's his name? - Yeah, Leo. - Leo! Leonard, yes. - What you know him? - That's who I'm here for. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Can I, can I? - As in Leo in apartment five? - Yes, yes, five. - You want me to sign for anything or? - No, no no no. This is a hand to hand package deal here. Gotta get it right to him. Forage on. Actually I'll follow you 'cause I don't know where I'm going. - Well it's just that, you know, I take care of him and I'm responsible for his place, so. - Yeah, that's okay. - I can't really have people just following me. - No, that's good, that's good. Can I use the bathroom though? I have to pee really bad. I waited a long time downstairs. - Okay. - Number five you said? Apples, that's good, that's good. Yeah, he loves all that organic shit. - Keeps the doctor away. Where's the bathroom? - On the left. Leo? Hello? - Thank you, God. I was sitting out there for like five hours. I thought I was gonna get another bladder infection. - Ah, you feel better? - Oh God, yeah I do actually. Thank you, but. But what? - Wow. - Everything okay? - Yeah, there's dead animals everywhere. What's that about? What is that? Is that a dinosaur? - No, that's a cat. What's your name again? - Yeah uh, Sara, Sara Landis. - Robert. - Are, are you Hawaiian. - I'm half Japanese. But there are a lot of halfies in Hawaii. - Japanese. You know I love Japan town. Sapporo, there's some great sushi restaurant's there. We should, we should do that sometime. You and me, yeah? What is that? It's a smoking monkey. - Hm. Can I have some water? - Yeah, sure. So are you his nurse? - No, I just, I watch over Leo a little bit. - Where are you from anyway? Are you a native. - I'm from Rochester. - I'm from Vermont. - Cool, same neck of land. - Oh my God. You take the 89 to the four to the 80 and your in fucking Rochester. We're like neighbors. It's like an hour and a half away. - Right. - Well, six hours. But you know, I mean, it depends if you get the. - I'm sorry to cut this short. I would love to hear where you're from, it's just not the right time. - Yeah, yeah. Can I get that water? Really thirsty. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Good? - That was a lot of water. - Is this gonna affect your bladder infection? - I gotta get finished. No, that's actually good for it. - And how did you say you knew Leo? - Yeah, oh we, I told you. Long, long time ago we met. We're good friends. - Okay, you're done with this, right? - Yeah. - Good. Sure. - So what do you, I don't know, what do you want? Ball's in your court. - Yeah, no, we can't, we gotta give it to him. I can't just leave it here. - Okay, so I guess you can try back tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow morning. Catch him either early in the morning or late at night. - Um, let me just, yeah okay. All right, well here, I'll just. - I don't even think it's taking a picture. - Yeah I got it. I guess I'll leave it here, but um, ah, I don't know. - Are you okay? Is everything okay? I have to go. Let's go. - Um, just uh, I'm starving. Oh, can I get a, what the hell is that? - Whoa whoa whoa. Come on, come on.

That's awesome. Oh my God. You know how lucky I feel right now? Let's go. Oh my God. - Okay. All right, that's great, thank you. - Leo will get your package, it's safe in the house. Why don't I take your number, maybe you'll feel better about it? - Yeah, that's problematic. I don't, I don't actually have a number. Uh, but let me take yours. Go ahead. Thank you. - Okay. - Thank you. Good, okay. - I have no idea. - Yeah, oh yeah. - Why you're here or where you're going, but it seems like you're on a journey. - Yeah. - And a nice lady, so. - Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Good luck. - Yeah. You're a good guy, Bobby. You're a good guy. - It's Robert. Who was she? - I don't know. - But was she hot? - She was odd, or odd hot. - Hey you got someone coming up here. Give them a flyer. - Hey, there's this thing tomorrow night and it's this party, and my friends gonna. Fuck him. - Robert. - This sucks, man. - What are you doing, man? What the fuck, man? - Every single fucking time. - Look how many flyers you got in your hand. You can't be acting up, jumping on people like that. It's a party, not a funeral man. There's nothing to be nervous about. - So what do I say? - You got someone coming up right here, right? You make eye contact. Don't jump on 'em. Just say, hey, party tomorrow night. Hope you can make it. All right, here she comes, here she comes. - All right. - Are you kidding me? You look like a retarded Travolta, man. - Really? - Dude. It's a party.

We got here, we found her in one of the apartments. - Okay. - She says that you're her boyfriend. That you gave her permission to be in the apartment. Is that true. - I was trying. - Sir, I need you to focus on my right now. - Yes, that's, that's my girlfriend. Here, there you go. Right, well the address on here doesn't match it. - I understand officer. I take care of Leo Glass in number five. I have keys. - Baby. I missed you so much, sweetie. - You have a key? - Yeah. - All right, go ahead and try to open the door. Let me see if your key works. - Bobby. - Keep your mouth shut. - See I told you, I told you. - All right that's fine, come on over here. One last question. - Yeah. - Where's she from? - She's from, she's from Ver. - From where? - From Vermont. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes I'm sure. - All right. - Thank you so much, officer. I'm really sorry. - Okay, let me give you a little piece of-- - Can I borrow those for the night? - Let me give you a little piece of advice, all right? - Yes. - Next time you're visiting, don't break into the place, all right? If you don't have a key, wait for a person that has a key. - Absolutely. - You get it? - Absolutely. - I don't think so. Good luck. - Bobby! Thank you so much. Did you see the look on his face when your key went right into that slot? He didn't know that. I'm not gonna fuck you by the way. Oh my God, it's still here. Oh God. - You trying to rob this place? No, of course not. - Then what are you doing breaking in in the middle of the night? - Well I just needed to get my package. What's there to rob here besides dead animals? Exactly. - I'm a vegetarian. - Okay, cut the fucking bullshit. - Okay, everyone just chill out for a second. No. - The package, there's no note. It would have been weird if he came home and it was sitting in his kitchen. - You didn't think about this before? The thought didn't cross your mind when you dropped it off? - You got a point. You got a point. - Okay, we're leaving. Bobby, hold on. - We're leaving. - You're the only one that knows Leo, and I need your help. I have to find him. - We are getting out of here. - No, no no no. You have to help me find him. We can stay here tonight, Bobby. - You crazy, you think I'm gonna help you find him now? - I'll sleep on the couch. Come on, Bobby, I thought you were a nurse. Aren't nurses supposed to help people? - I'm here at two o'clock in the fucking morning in my pajamas, all right? No, I know, I know, you're adorable. - No, this is, this is not a joke. Who the hell do you think you are? What makes you think that I should be here saving your ass and how long have you been? - Okay, okay, listen all right? I get it. We got off on the wrong foot, I'm sorry. And the whole situation is very ah! I get it, but, this is a very delicate situation and if you knew you wouldn't be talking like this. You're gonna feel like such a jackass. - Okay, then explain it to me. What's the situation? I'm done. - What are you some kind of soulless maniac? What's wrong with you? I'm in the street tonight. Shit! - Ah, blueberry, my favorite. Hi. - No. - Oh God. - Unbelievable. - Look, hold on, hold on. The way I see it is, you can give in now or later, 'cause we both know I'm not going anywhere. - I've given in, okay? - Take this as an opportunity to help somebody. Meet somebody new. - Yeah well, we've already met. Enjoy the muffin, all right? - I promise, I'm really fun. - Mm-hm. I think I've already seen how fun you can be. - Bobby, wait. Wait wait wait wait wait. Bobby wait. Bobby, wait wait wait wait. Okay okay, let me break it down. Um, have you ever, have you ever had a secret that you couldn't tell anybody in your life that was so important but that, that some fucked up life experience wouldn't allow you to get what you needed? Have you ever, have you ever had that? - Sure, that's the human condition. We have have those, so what? - Look, okay okay, I can help you. - I think the only way you can help me is by leaving me alone. - I'll do anything you need, Bobby. It's that important. - I don't need anything from you. - Just take 10 minutes out of your life and just take me to a place that Leonard goes. 10 minutes. 10 minutes. - I can't help you. This is, it's not my job to, to take care of your psychological issues. - Oh Bobby, I see it. - What do you see? - I see it, I see it, I see it. I'm so sorry. Whatever it is. I know. - 10 minutes, okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. 10 minutes, okay? So I have no idea if he's gonna be here or not. Just letting you know. I don't want to get your hopes up but, a lot of times on a sunny day he does yoga out here. - This is where he does yoga. - Yup. - Oh my God, dog. Dogs! Hi cuties. God, I didn't realize we were gonna be mountain climbing. This bag is so heavy. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Throw it on there. I'm like a snail, you know? A snail has a big apartment on its back. So I just carry. - Yeah, now I'm like a snail. - I just, I don't buy into the whole philosophy of defining yourself by the things you have. I mean that's what the society does. It it it tries to make you think that that's how you have to be. But you don't. - Well if you don't define yourself by your things then why do you carry everything with you? - What do you mean? It means everything that I have is important to me. Don't you have things that people important to you gave you? Like your mom or your sister or your girlfriend? You don't have a girlfriend? - No. - Are you in love with somebody. What's her name, Bobby? - Uh. Her name's Jenny, okay? We'll leave it at that. - Jenny? I can help you with Jenny! I know women, I am a woman. - Yeah? - I am a woman. Okay, we'll set it up. I'll set it up for you. You just sit back and I'll take care of everything. - There's nothing to set up. I'm leaving, she has a boyfriend. - Yeah. - It's complicated. Boyfriends are tough. What's he like? - He's perfect. - Well what time did they walk in today? They didn't call, they just showed up? Yeah, with no appointment? Well I had I no idea they were gonna come in. Sorry, this client came in and didn't have an appointment and they wanted us to come up with a proposal for them on the spot, I just, yeah. - I know, I heard, I know. I hope they give you unlimited minutes on that thing. - It's for the greater good, baby. You want to eat, don't you? Hey good morning. How you doing? - Hey Glen, good morning. - Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - Dr Hollerman, this is my girlfriend Jenny. Jenny, this is Dr Hollerman. Hi Jenny, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - We played doubles last week at the club for the first time. Yeah he beat my butt. - This guys got a hell of a backhand, I tell you. - Really? - So what do you do? - Well-- - She's actually getting her MFA. She's going into publishing. - It's a MFA in writing. - That's terrific. - She's so talented. - He's a great guy, hold on to him. - Aw, come on. - Thank you. My passion is traveling, actually. Yeah. - I love going somewhere new, it's so exciting. And then there's new food and new places. Where have you been to? - I've traveled plenty. - Yeah, where? - I've been to Toronto and Niagra Falls. - Toronto, okay, all right. - That's like being. - You need to get on an airplane and go somewhere immediately, I'm serious. - Yeah, with what money? - Who cares? Just get there. - Okay, so you're traveling the world. You're a nomad, you're a gypsy. How long is that gonna last you before at some point, you have to figure out how to put food on the table? I mean do you want kids? - Food on the table? - Do you want to get married? I mean what about you? You're asking me all these questions about love, love, love, love. Do you have a boyfriend? What? I'm joke, I'm just saying. You know, if you think that it makes, it would make me feel better to talk about my romance. - Just stop, okay? No, no no no no, just. You do not need to be asking me anything about my life. You have no right to pry into my life. You don't know who I am. You don't know what I've been through, okay Bobby? - All right, so I'm just, I'm sorry. I just, I was just asking. I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about it. - What up, bro? - Hey, what's up, man? I'm cooking. Anyway, what are you doing man? Well you're not gonna believe this. I'm in the Hague and I'm still with that chick from yesterday. The nutty one? Yeah. At first she was pretty crazy and, I was a little bit surprised. I didn't know what to do, but she's not so bad. Why are you in the Hague? Yeah, you know, she needs to find Leo and I need to find Leo, so at this point I could really use the money. He's offered to buy my drawing. What? Yeah. That's great. Yeah it's pretty cool, pretty cool. But I think it's a real sympathy move. No, oh come on. No that's validation, baby. That's nothing less. A little validation goes all the way, man. I guess so, but do you really think it's worth 300 bucks? Who cares? Listen, are you coming to the party tonight? 'Cause it's gonna be epic baby, epic. Yeah, well hopefully all that hard work will have paid off then. - Bobby, Bobby! Oh my God. - What's the matter? - Come on, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go.

We were in the moment, all right? So let's, let's stick with that, okay? Okay. - And stop being so fucking grumpy. - There's only on place I can really think of that Leo's likely to be at. - Oh hi. - Hey, you haven't see Leo around at all today, have you? - No, not yet. - No? - Wow.

She's got a really cutesy sense of humor and. - Cutesy. - She's really charismatic. Mm-hm, mm-hm. - She walks into a room and everyone stops for a second, it's, she's breathtaking. - Oh yes, she sounds like a breath of fresh air. - She is. - Have you tried anything with her? - Well, we kissed last Friday. - You piece of shit. - Only once. What? - You're scum. - I know. But I wouldn't expect, you're telling me to be brave and explore, now you're calling, now I'm scum and a piece of shit. - Wow, you kissed a girl with a boyfriend. Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Look. - The "Tropic of Cancer." - Amazing. - Yeah, you know Leo's got that in his house. - Look, okay. You have to read this book, okay? It's gonna change your life. This guy, he just basically picks up and takes off and doesn't give a fuck about anything that he's left behind and he just goes out into the world and he just lives. And he basically just embraces it. You gotta read it. Buy it. I don't have any cash. God, my nails are a mess. - They look fine to me. - No no no no, I have to do a little work, a little maintenance. Just one click little swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. See, that easy. They're cute, they look like abalone shells. - Do you like 'em? Thanks. - Think it fits your style. - What are you eating? Just some noodles and chicken. - Chicken? - Mm-hm. - Bobby, animals are our friends, okay? All right. - They're our friends, be nice to your friends. - Okay, thanks pal. I really appreciate you sacrificing your life so I could enjoy you, your deliciousness and get my protein and thank you very much. - You think you're cute, don't you? You're not cute. So talk to me about Jenny. - I don't want to wallow in my depression right now. I have to be excited about where I'm going. Let's not think about that. Have you told her how you feel? - Sure, she knows I really care about her. She knows. We kissed. That's a connection, she gets that. Am I gonna just, you know, tell her how I feel and screw things up even more? If it really mattered that much to her, she would have come to meet me this morning. - She doesn't know how you feel, Bobby. How is she supposed to give up her entire life for somebody she can't even, she doesn't even know? I'm not asking her to. - Okay. Look, you have to tell her how you feel. If you want her to come to you she needs to know. Put it down. Put it down, gone, gone. All right. I'm gonna give you V-L-T, visual love technique. It works, it works. Okay, look at me. Square up. Go into your Zen Buddha place, heart of the Buddha. And I want you to imagine that I am Miss Jenny. Whatever you say, I'm gonna be completely receptive to. - Okay. - Okay? All right, take your time and when you open your eyes, I am Jenny. - Hey Jenny. I really want to have things be really good with us. - Okay stop, that's pathetic. - This feels silly, do you have to have. - Work with me on this, okay? All right, let's do it again. - Okay. Hey Jenny. - Hey. - You look beautiful. - You're so sweet Robert. You're always so nice to me. - What happened the other night? - I don't know. I feel so confused about that. I've been thinking about what I'm gonna say to you. - Okay. - And I, I still don't know what to say. - Do you feel anything? Am I, am I an idiot? Am I alone on this? - I feel so guilty. And it's not even, I don't even just feel guilty towards Glen, I feel guilty towards you, too. - I need to know, do we have a chance? - Bobby, Bobby. That was so good. Are you okay? That's beautiful, come here. Come here. Sure beats the hell out of the office. I know. - I ready your story. - Falsetto? - Yeah, and I read it and I loved it. And I have a friend of mine in publishing. I forget what company she works for, but I gave it to her and she read it. - What'd she say? - Well, if you're interested, when the semester's over, she uh, would like to offer you an internship. I think she said, I'm trying to remember her exact words but, that you showed a lot of promise as a young up and coming writer. - I do. - Don't you? I like the way it sounded too. It was like print that, print that. Oh, thank you, baby. That's uh, that was so thoughtful of you to show her that. What made you wanna? - Well, I mean, it's your future. It's important to me and I just want to do anything I can to help. So. - Thank you. So um, who were you on the phone with so late last night? - Ah, Sammy. It wasn't a work related call, I swear. Poor guy. Him and Roxy are breaking up. - What do you mean? We just saw them on Friday. - I know. Um, I don't know what happened. She's been, I guess he was just telling me that she's been acting really weird lately. - They seemed fine. - I know, right? - That's too bad. - Yeah. Got me thinking a little bit. - What do you mean? - Just got me thinking about us. Uh, I know that I work a lot and I take phone calls sometimes at inappropriate times. But I'm only doing it for us. Because, I just want to make sure that kind of everything will be okay for the future. I love you. You're the most important thing. So don't ever think you're not, please. - No way. - Jenny. - Hey. Good to see you. - You too. What are you doing here? - Oh, we're just, we had the day off so we're kind of strolling. - I've seen you before, around, I'm not sure. I'm Glen, hi. - Glen, it's Morgan. - We, we go to school together. - Your party the other night was so fun. - I know. Where you pretty hung over the next morning? - I will never drink rum for the rest of my life. - Oh yeah you will. - You sure. - That guy Robert is so cute. He was cracking me up. - Oh, yeah. - Adorable. - You think so. Yeah he's pretty fun. - I don't know why you didn't hook Robert up with your friend over there. - Morgan? She's really not his type. She's hot, she's anybody's type. - Really? She's hot so that makes her anybody's type. Just saying. - She's hot so she's anybody's type. She's not an ax murderer, is she? - Yeah, right. 'Cause if you're not hot, you're probably an ax murderer, right Glen? - Well, guess there's no better time to do this. There's tickets to the theater tonight. - No Exit. You wanna go to this? - Yeah, I love musicals. I just don't know if I want to take you anymore. - Baby, it's not a musical. Right. - You would sit through this for me? - Yeah, you know. You like the theater. I want to make you happy. It'll be fun, we'll make a night of it. - Yeah, but it's Robert's last night here. Well um, maybe we can get out in time? - Yeah, I don't think so, it's. Well it's fine, we don't have to go. - No, no we, I want to go. Yeah, I think we should go. I mean, when else am I gonna get to drag you to the theater, right? Depending on how this goes. Depending on how it goes. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - It's perfect. - Hey Leo, it's Robert. I haven't seen you around in a little while so I hope everything's okay. But I was by the house and I was wondering if you still want to buy my drawing. I didn't see any money there. So please please give me a call before I leave tonight. I'd really appreciate it. I'd love to say goodbye. As a side note, there's someone here that has a package for you, so give me a call. All right, take care, bye. - What's he giving you money for? - It's a, it's a drawing I did of him. - Really? - Yeah. - So you're like a real artist? Oh my God! Bobby, that's amazing! - I guess so. - You're like Picasso or Monet or Terenzio, I'm so proud of you. That's amazing, let's go do something fun. - Well I think he just feels bad for me to be honest. - No, come on, you're amazing. Let's do something fun, let's celebrate. - Like what, like what? - I don't know, anything. Be spontaneous. Come on, Bobby. - Let's get outta here. - Yeah. What's going on? - I don't know, hold on. - Just, you know, give it a good one. Wait, hold on, hold on. Give it a good, you know. Give it a good solid. Come on. - Oh crap. You know how long I had that car for and how much money I've put into it? - Ugh, poor you. Aren't you leaving anyway? Why do you need a car? - My friend was gonna sell it for me. For what? Fives of tens of dollars? - Look, Sara, I think it's best we go our separate ways. What? No. - I gotta catch a bus home. - No, Bobby, what about Leo? What are you talking about right now? - What about him? We're not gonna find Leo. I mean we've looked for him. How do you expect us to get around town? - We can, we can, we can, we can take a cab. - A cab? With my money? I mean, I can't pay for a cab to wander around the city right now. - Yeah, okay. Yeah. Money's tough, huh? - What? - Sara. - Okay. Okay. - Sara, what are you doing? - Come on. - What? - Oh my God, the keys are in it, come on. - This is crazy.

What the fuck do you want me to say? - Well I told you everything about myself. The one time I ask you a question about you, it's like I lit a fire under your ass. - You know what? You know what?

Wait, hold up a sec. - I apologize for overreacting. I just uh, I was really caught off guard by him. I didn't expect to see him. Yeah, who was that? - He's a, he's an old friend. He's a friend of my husband's. We used to party together. Mm-hm. - I don't think he knew. Knew, what? - My husband, he was called on a long tour in Afghanistan and I thought he was coming home but then he got called on a second tour. It must be really difficult to be apart. - You have no idea. The last time I saw him, he made me blueberry pancakes. Brought them to me in bed. He's gone. What do you mean? - He's dead. He died about a year ago. I got a knock at the door. And they gave me a flag and a letter. Your husband's gone. That was it, I don't know. Look, Bobby, you gotta live your life. Okay, you need to everything that, that you need to do everything that you want to do and say everything that you want to say and don't hold it back. 'Cause you don't know, you just don't know. You don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. You could lose everything just like that. You get it? You need to talk to her. No regrets. Time's precious. Are you gonna get that? - It's okay. - No, get it. It could be somebody important. - Oh, it's Jenny. - Answer it. - I don't know. - Are you crazy? Answer it. - Hello? - Hey. So I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to see you before you go. Glen surprised me. He planned this whole day. We went to Sausalito and now I think we're going to the theater. I feel like I'm not gonna get to say goodbye to you. Hey babe, have you seen my contact solution?

You do not know how longingly I look upon you. You must be he I was seeking or she I was seeking. I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you. All is recalled as we flit by each other. Fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured. You grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl with me. I ate with you and I slept with you. Your body has become not yours only, nor left my body. Mine. Only. You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh. As we pass you, you take my beard, my breast, hands. In return I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you and I sit alone, awake. At night alone. I am to wait. I do not doubt that I am to meet you again. I am to see to it that I do not lose you. Are you checking any bags this evening? - Uh yeah, one. - That'll be $35 please. - You know what? Cancel my flight. Cancel your flight. Are you sure? - I'm sure. All right. Just be aware that cancellation of all non-refundable tickets results in $150 administration fee, plus the difference between the previously purchased fare and the new fare. Can I reschedule your flight to Rochester? - Actually, I'd like to book a new flight. Final destination?
