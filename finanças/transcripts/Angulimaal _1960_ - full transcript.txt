I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha When your invaluable heart is afraid When it stumbles Then, oh human, chant I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha When unrest plays its tune When red blood is spilled When the flames of violence rise When humans become animals When people's smiles turn poisonous Springtime has come Flowers bloom in every forest My cheery heart dances Joy is all around The bumblebee hums as it kisses the buds The buds remove their veils and dance The leaves on the yellow peepul sway Nobody is lonely today It is the time of union and bonding With every step, her anklet rings The maiden decks herself up She adjusts her veil and goes to her beloved Shyness in her eyes, love in her gestures Acceptance in her heart, refusal on her lips lnstruments play The water gun sprays colors Today is the day of colors Rain? In spring? This is very inauspicious. Surely trouble is on the way. Congratulations, priest! It's a boy. Really? You've answered our prayers, God. There's no end to my happiness today. - Bahuk! - Yes? Ask the royal astrologer for his horoscope. Here, your darling is ten days old now. Bless him. Long live, my son. Make your clan proud. - Greetings, royal priest. - Greetings, royal astrologer. Come in, please. Greetings, royal astrologer. Have a sweet. What's the matter? Sit down. What does the horoscope say? Why are you silent? What can I say? - Are his stars... - Not aligned properly? They're all wrong. - His lifetime? - Very long. - Health? - Well. - Knowledge? - Lots of it. Then what's wrong with his stars? This child will be a murderer. His hands will slice many necks. He brought storm and destruction when he was born... and it will always follow him. Every place he passes through will be destroyed. He'll thirst for human blood. Oh God, what is this I hear? Don't say that, astrologer. God has given him to us after a lot of worship. Don't say that, astrologer. It doesn't matter what I say. The stars and his horoscope have spoken. Alright, I'm leaving. I have to reach the court. So do I. The king wishes to bless the child. How radiant his face is. Astrologer, have you made our little priest's horoscope? - I have, my lord. - How is his future? - Horrible. - What are you saying? Yes, my lord. His horoscope says he will become a murderer. A murderer? Yes, my lord. His hands will slice many necks. Every place he passes through will be destroyed. This child will thirst for human blood. Child? He's a wolf! This wolf should be drowned in the Ganges! Yes, he should be killed before he kills. My lord! Please calm down. Nobody can be punished before they commit a crime. And then, horoscopes can be wrong. Praise the king. My horoscopes have never been wrong. Alright, astrologer. But how can we strangle a child who can't even move yet? Yes, if he grows up to be a sinner... I'll teach him religion until he's twelve. And after that, I will take him to my gurukul. And the royal treasury will pay for his education. Praise the king. Priest, what have you named him?' My lord, his naming ceremony has yet to take place. Then name him Ahinsak (non-violent). As you wish, my lord. Ahinsak, who can never be violent. Who can never give grief to anyone. Ahinsak. I will practice religion and charity for his betterment. Salutations to the god of Brahmins Salutations to the creator of the world Salutations to Krishna Flute-carrying Gopal My son takes refuge in you He rests in your feet Take care of him My flower is fragile, and your world, tough Kanha, take his sinking boat to the shore Oh sailor... keep away trouble Cleanse his sins with the holy water from my eyes I offer you my life. Make my son immortal May he light the torch of peace in this world May he make his country proud I know. It's my son, Ahinsak. You don't wear good clothes. Why? - So that you're good. - I'm not good now? Of course you are. I ask God to make you better. Why don't you just ask me? You'll tell God, he'll tell me. Why go to all that trouble for an easy task? Rogue! I'll box your ears before I take the easy way. - What's going on? - Father, mother's boxing my ears. Alright. You're not ready yet? Congratulations, your majesty. Long live the princess. Thank you, teacher. Children with gifts for the princess may step forward. The chief minister's son, Maruti. Take it, Mangala. Lord Chandrasen's son, Dhanpal. - Ahinsak. - What a beautiful garland! Thank you. Do you like flowers? Yes. No, put it around my neck. Do it. I want to ask the children a few questions. - Ask, my lord. - Will you answer them? - Yes, my lord. - They'll be difficult. Alright, tell me, who is man's biggest enemy? - A lion. - No. You? - A snake. - No, our fathers, who always hit us. No, child. Fathers are like gods. Alright, you tell me. My lord, a man's biggest enemy is anger. Anger. Good. Who is a man's best friend? - Wealth. - No, a sword. - No, sweetballs. - No. You tell me. My lord, a man's best friend is his religion. - Wonderful! Royal astrologer? - Yes, my lord? Have you seen the power of knowledge? I apologize, my lord, but the stars are powerful too. Gyandutta, you've really bettered Ahinsak. - Teacher? - Yes, my lord? You will take Ahinsak to the gurukul today with the other children. And the day he returns here, even better than he is now... will mark the victory of hard work and ordination over destiny. Son, your teacher is now your father. Respect him, study well, and become a scholar. But mother, how will I have a mother like you in the gurukul? Your teacher's wife will be in the gurukul. She'll be your mother. See that you always obey and serve her. Will she love me like you do? Yes, and you were alone here. You'll have many brothers there. Be good to them and don't pick fights. - I'm Ahinsak, mother. - Yes, you are. But parents' hearts are always worried. Teacher, our only son is with you now. - Please forgive his mistakes. - Don't worry, it'll be alright. Come, son. These are the children of Shravasti. This is your gurumata. - Maruti. - Long live. - Dhanpal. - Long live. - Krishna. - Long live. - And this is Ahinsak. - Long live, son, and stay happy. - Come. When I left home, my mother said I'd have a new mother here. Yes, son. This gurukul is your new home, and she is your new mother. Then I needn't worry. You're just like my mother. My blessings, son. Between his teaching and my love... you'll be perfect when you return to your mother. But mother, you aren't much older than me. You can't box my ears like my mother does. You idiot, age doesn't matter. Of course I'll box your ears. - But not too hard. - Come. - What kind of gurumata is she? - She's barely older than us. You're right, child. For years, the gurukul had no mother. The teacher accepted our pleas, and we got her. Now I get it. The teacher married recently. Alright, come on. Yesterday, Ahinsak won. Today, we'll study the Upanishads. What form does the soul take? Ahinsak? You take aim now, but at the small fruit, alright? - Wonderful. - Well done, son. - All my children are very good. - And Ahinsak? The best. Well done. The race will begin now. Stand by that door, all of you. Run when I ask you to. Let's see who comes first. - Alright, Ahinsak? - Yes, teacher. Maruti? Dhanpal? Krishna? Alright, go. Run! Well done, Ahinsak! Long live, long live. Well done, Ahinsak, you're the best at horseriding, too. These children have grown up. Yes. This is Maruti, this is Dhanpal, this is Krishna. And this is Ahinsak. This is Randhir, the deputy commander. The king sent him to check on your education. What can the students lack when you're their teacher? - I'm satisfied with their progress. - The king specially asked about Ahinsak. Ahinsak? He's the best at everything. Weaponry, academics... and you've seen his horseriding. Alright, allow me to leave. I have to reach the capital and prepare for the princess's visit. - She'll be hunting in the forest nearby soon. - Alright, come. Did you hear that, Maruti? Your princess is coming. - The matter seems delicate to me. - How? How? This mister Randhir will praise Ahinsak there. And if the king decides on Ahinsak instead of Maruti... - This can't happen. - Don't be mistaken. - The king specifically asked about him. - Yes. - The king's promised my father. - But promises... Shut up. The princess is mine and always will be. - Your life is undisciplined. - No, mother, it's... Now you'll say that Krishna messed everything up. Not just Krishna, others came, too. One pulled this book, the other pulled that... - How could I say no? - You should've. - Mother. - What? You musn't care so much about me. Idiot! I don't care that much. - You do. - So what? Who doesn't care about you? - Your teacher... - No, mother. I don't like it. Ahinsak, son, what's happened to you today? Nothing, mother. Just don't care so much for me. Well done, gurumata. I don't like this behaviour. Neither do I. Why's she always going on about Ahinsak? Why doesn't the teacher mind this? Ahinsak is ahead of us all, but it doesn't mean she'll only praise him. Forget it, Maruti. I'm not worried about what's going on in the gurukul. - I'm worried about what'll happen elsewhere. - Elsewhere? Oh, you idiot, stop worrying about guruma'ta. - Keep your princess in control. - She's come, she's come! - Give me a sweet, Maruti. - Who's come? - The one who's yours. - Mine? Who? - The one. Don't you remember? - Why don't you tell me? Your dear princess. She's hunting in the forest nearby. We know that, but how is she his princess? Ahinsak has blocked the path. Why don't you shut up? Come, let's meet the princess. Well done! Your teacher has taught you well. Come, test your arrows. Who's this coward who hides and attacks me? Why don't you come here? Go on, fire another arrow. This one was yours too. Oh, forgive me. I missed my target. You miss your aim, and the arrow hits an innocent. - But it didn't hit you. - What if it had? - What do you mean? - You don't know archery. A woman's soft hands aren't meant to fire arrows, they're... Meant to box a man's ears. Go away. - You didn't obey my order. - Order? Are you a princess? Yes. You're standing before the princess of Shravasti. Princess Maya? You've grown up so much. I apologize for my insolence. - I know you. - But I don't know you. I'm the royal priest's son, Ahinsak. Ahinsak? Now I remember. You once gave me a garland. You remember it? Your garland withered, but its memory is fresh in my mind. Thank you, but why are you here? I've come to hunt. My tent is close by. Will you come with me? - As you wish. - Come. - Sit down. - I? You're the one who's come hunting. You pulled back your bow and fired arrows The arrow hit her heart You're now unconscious of your body and heart Your soul writhes like a fish Look, her eyes are nervous Your heart is restless How will these nights be spent? Why did you come to make my heart ill at ease? Would you look at it, the hunters have come to hunt You've worked so hard to injure his heart Your eyes could very well have done that Why do you throw so many tantrums? Oh, what torture is this? The colors change. Your body dances This bond will never break Why did you come to let your eyes meet hers? To attack these innocent deer - The princess still hasn't returned. - We've been waiting for ages. God knows what she's hunting. I've always said that... Wonderful. What animals the princess has caught! - Oh, so that's why she's late. - Isn't he a good hunter? Oh, you've come here, too? Let us have a chance. Who are these mannerless people? These are my companions. Let me introduce you. This is Maruti, the chief minister's son. This is Lord Chandrasen's son, Dhanpal. And this is Krishnachandra, the commander's mannerless son. Father has told me about you. I was just about to call for you. Thank you for coming. Please have something. - No, it's very late now. - Then please come tomorrow. If he's a brave warrior, then we're cunning, too. Our arrows never miss. You've patted yourself on the back enough. Tell us what to do. What do you mean? Utter a few words of love, and victory will be yours. - Yes! - The problem is that I can love... - but I can't pretend to love. - You can't? - Then take lessons from me! - Really, teacher? - Really, teacher? - Bless you! First, stand before her as if you're the bravest soldier in the world. Then, with your eyes full of love, look at her. You must be smiling, just like this. Not less, not more. When she looks at you, say, "Maya!" "You've stolen my peace and my sleep." "Oh, my beautiful thief, return my peace and sleep to me!" - Krishna! - "Return it!" Say it just like that. Then she'll say, uh, what will she say? She'll look at you with her large eyes and her face will turn red. - As soon as it does, grab the end of her saree. - Oh! - Then give her your sword. Take it! - Take it, Maruti. And say,"If you don't have mercy on me, stab me with this sword!" - Here. - She won't stab you, she'll throw it away. - Throw it, Maruti. - Then she'll say... "Oh, beloved, ever since I've seen you, my eyes have searched for you." "They search for dreams, and look for your lovely face in them." "Don't leave me, don't leave me!" - Well done, teacher! - Hail the teacher! - Listen, Maruti. - What is it, Dhanpal? Ahinsak hasn't come yet. Tell the princess how you feel. Yes! If Ahinsak comes, your feelings will remain in your heart. - But you two? - We'll come. Go. Tell the princess Maruti has come. Oh! Please come in. Princess? - Hail the princess. - You? You're very early. Please come. Where are your friends? - Perhaps you mean Ahinsak. - You have other friends too. - What do you care for them? - I don't understand. - Then try to. - Forget it. I've prepared for your entertainment. Once your friends are here... - Before that, I'd like to say something. - Please go ahead. - In private. - Oh, is it important? - Yes. - Basanti? - I wanted to say... - Yes, go ahead. - The way you're with Ahinsak all the time... - That's all you wanted to say? - That's not a big deal. - It is for me. - Are you aware I'm the chief minister's son? - I am. - Did you know you're betrothed to me? - I did not. - You know it now. It's what the king wants. - Perhaps you do, too. - But do you know what I want? - I do. - You and Ahinsak are very different. - It's my job to think of that. Who I meet and who I don't is my business, too. - I don't need your advice. - You're insulting me, princess. Oh, you've come! - You took so long. Come in. - Oh, Maruti. - Where are you off to? Have a seat. - My friends and I will come in a while. Come. - Did something happen? - No, but it will now. Well done! Princess! The tiger has left its cage. Princess! Don't go outside. - Princess! - Ahinsak! Stop him, Basanti. Let go of me, Basanti. Thank you! What have you done? What if you'd missed your aim? Come in. Basanti. Prepare the medicine. Allow me to leave, princess. I must return to the gurukul now. - No, I won't let you. - But the wound isn't very deep, princess. - I should go. My friends have already left. - Friends? They're cowards. They let you risk your life and ran away. - Come in, you must rest here. - But... Come. Mangala? - Greetings, teacher. - Where's Ahinsak? - In the princess's camp. - In her camp? It's past dusk. He should've returned by now. - He'll spend the night there. - How can this be? The gurukul's rules... We tried to tell him, teacher, but he said rules are for fools. He fought with me about this and ended up injured. - He's become quite mean, teacher. - Send him to me when he returns. What will the teacher think? I can't speak for your teacher, but the princess is definitely lost in thought. - I? What am I thinking of? - How should I know? Oh, yes, I was thinking of how you risked your life for me. - How can I ever repay you? - Repay? Don't worry, our princess has already repaid you. - How? - By injuring herself with you. Injured? Where? Some wounds cannot be seen, princess, and they hurt a lot. What nonsense! Go away! - I've wanted to leave for a while. - Idiot! - Thank you, Mangala. - For what? Leaving? Again? She says such inappropriate things. But there are things you can't say yourself. And there are things that shouldn't be said. - Keep quiet and get some rest. - Rest? There's none for me. - You aren't sleepy? - How can I be, with the moon before me? The moon? But the moon is outside, in the sky. Yours must be. Mine is right here, on the earth. You won't stop talking? Alright, I will. But your eyes have spoken, and I understand their language. Alright, get some rest. It's late at night. I hope this night never ends, and the moon never sets. Set slowly, oh moon This quiet night won't return tomorrow The incomplete dreams of my childhood are coming true today I don't know when these golden moments will return The bride of love has dressed up, clarinets play in my heart Today, I will use the night as kohl to streak my eyes We'll meet in Shravasti now. We'll come to Shravasti in a few days. And I'm returning today. You must come to Shravasti on the next full moon. - Why? - It's my birthday. You once gifted me a garland. That's why I came here. We've met again after so long. Won't you come? No, princess. Leaving the gurukul like this... - No, you must fulfill my wish. - It's my wish, too, but... No buts. You must come. It's very hard to refuse you. Alright, allow me to leave. Come. - You asked for me, teacher? - Where did you spend the night? I was injured, teacher. I couldn't return. - You've broken the gurukul's rule. - Forgive me, teacher. You've broken the gurukul's rule today. You'll break society's rules tomorrow. - It appears the prediction was true. - Prediction? What are you saying? - Ahrinsak, leave before I get angry. - Teacher! The princess was right in asking you to stay, but you weren't right in staying. The gurukul has rules, discipline. You'll be more careful in the future, won't you? I will. Who moves in your heart, in your eyes, in your life? Who speaks in your soul, in your dreams, in your breath? Go away, I won't tell you the name of my beloved This is the secret love of the moon and the partridge Dark clouds live in his curly hair, the moon fawns over his face When I look at his blue eyes and bow-like brows, I nearly die Who is the trickster, the troublemaker, who adds color to your life? Studs in his ears, a bow on his shoulder, a red line on his forehead The one my eyes have fallen in love with is one among a million Who is the beloved who lives in your heart and removes your veil? What are you staring at? Go away! I'll leave too, princess. Will you allow me? You took so long. I've been waiting. It takes time to get here from the gurukul. - And... - And? It's thorny, too. I walked on those thorns and got you this garland. - This is your birthday gift. - There's someone I like more than these flowers. - Who is it? - Someone. - Tell me, who is it? Tell me. - This one. What have you done, princess? You once put a garland around my neck. I've done the same to you today. - But we're not children now, princess. - I know that, too. And do you know what it means when a woman garlands a man? - Tell me. - How can I? Don't address me so formally. Our language has informal words, too. Princess, it would mean something else. It only means what I ask of you now. - What? - Love. I only want your love. May I have it? What can I give someone whose name hits me like lightning... whose voice always echoes in my ears... whose face is a moon when I'm awake and a dream when I sleep? - All I think of is the storm that... - We'll turn the storms into shores, Ahinsak. If our love is true. - Maya... - Ahinsak... Ahinsak? - He still hasn't returned. - Who, Ahinsak? He must've gone to disgrace us. - But why are you here so late at night? - I've worried about him all evening. I couldn't fall asleep, so I thought I'd see if he's returned. - Look, here he is. - Teacher. Gurumata. Where were you? Nobody knew your whereabouts. Do you know how late it is? - Tell me, where did you go? - To meet someone. - Who? - Forgive me, teacher. They don't want me to tell anyone. Ahinsak! It appears the prediction will come true. - A prediction? About me? - Yes. You can't enter the gurukul today. It's the second time you've broken its rules. I didn't punish you last time, but I can't forgive you again. You'll have to sleep outside today, under the open sky. As you wish, teacher. No. You'll sleep without those. Nothing to lie on, nothing to drape. As you wish. What is this cruel wish? Outside, on this cold winter night. - Nothing to lie on, nothing to drape... - Keep quiet. The gurukul has rules, discipline. Go away. - Maruti! - Teacher? I'm coming. Ahinsak has just returned. Do you know where he went? - Yes, we all know. - Where did he go? - To the princess. - Why didn't you tell me? There's a lot I've wanted to say, but I couldn't find the courage. - Is there more? - Yes, there is. What? Promise me you won't get mad when I tell you, and you'll look into it. I promise. Speak. What is it? - Gurumata is very gracious to Ahinsak. - I know, but so what? - This graciousness is frowned upon. - Do you know what you're saying? That's why I didn't speak up. - Well done, Maruti, well done. - You've won. I've poisoned the teacher's thoughts. The arrow has hit its target. Now Ahinsak is... - Gurumata is very gracious to Ahinsak. - I know, but so what? - This graciousness is frowned upon. - Do you know what you're saying? Why are you laughing? Come to the arena. - I'll defeat you, too. - No, you play. I'm unwell. Why not just say you don't dare to face Maruti? Coward. I've learned swordfighting, but I don't believe in it. - Then? - I believe in the power of peace and love. - In the power of the princess's love? - Maruti! Oh? This is your chance, Maruti! Help, help! Teacher! He's killed Maruti! Is anyone here? - Teacher! - What is it? - Ahinsak tried to kill Maruti. - No, teacher. They tried to kill me. They called me cowardly and challenged me. Aren't you ashamed of lying? Krishna did jokingly take the princess's name. - He attacked him with his sword. - And when Maruti tried to save me... Quiet! I've understood everything, Krishna. This is what he's meant to do. It's in his horoscope. Teacher, you often speak of my horoscope. What's written in my horoscope? What's written in it is coming true. Cruel, lowly murderer! - Teacher! - It's two days until gurudakshina. At least let them pass, Murderer! - Get out of my sight! - Teacher! Why's Ahinsak crying? What did you tell the child? Child? Aren't you ashamed of calling him that? What are you saying? What's happened to you? - You're asking me? - Who else should I ask? Ask your heart. Ask that murderer! - Murderer? Who? - Your darling Ahinsak! Ahinsak, a murderer? What has he done? What hasn't he done? He doesn't care for the gurukul's rules. He attacked Maruti. He's entrapped the princess. He... Get out of my sight! Here. It's time to leave the gurukul. - But Ahinsak? - He's ill. - Gurumata must've told him to be. - Why's that? So he can stay back. So he won't give gurudakshina at the dikshant ceremony? God save us from such sinners, such cruel men, such... Forget it. What's it to us? - As he sows... - So shall he reap! - Ahinsak, how are you now, son? - Alright, mother. Oh! You're feverish. Where are you going like this? The dikshant ceremony is today. I have to give gurudakshina. I have to return to Shravasti with your and the teacher's blessings. No, you can't go to Shravasti like this. - But all my friends are going. - You can go later. I won't let you go today. Go to sleep. Such high fever. Ahinsak, you won't forget me when you're in Shravasti, will you? How can anyone forget such love? - You'll visit sometimes, won't you? - Yes, I surely will. When you're gone, I'll be so lonely in the gurukul. - I'll keep visiting. - Alright, I'll bring you warm milk. - Ahinsak! - Teacher? - Leave the gurukul right away! - Teacher! - Leave! - Why, teacher? Why? As if you don't know! Leave! But what's my crime? Crime? It's my crime, not yours, that I couldn't mend your ways. But my gurudakshina? Gurudakshina? What gurudakshina will a lowly murderer give me? Go, murder innocent people! Ruin society's peace! Take away married women's... Oh! Perhaps this was your gurudakshina! - Leave! - Teacher, my knowledge will be incomplete without gurudakshina. Punish me if I've committed a crime. Teacher! - I don't understand. What have I done? - What an innocent child you are! Dhanpal! You know the reason for the teacher's anger. Yes, I know it. You've betrayed the people who loved you. - What? - The king graciously sent you here to study... - and you entrapped his daughter. - Dhanpal! The teacher raised you with care and you cast your evil eye on his wife. Dhanpal! - How dare you? - Such words for gurumata, who is as pure as the Ganges? For a woman who is like my mother? - How dare you? - Take back your words. - Take back your words! - No! What can a lowly murderer like you give me? Go, murder innocent people! Ruin society's peace! Take away married women's... Oh! Perhaps this was your gurudakshina! - Leave! - Dhanpal! Dhanpal, Ahinsak? Dhanpal? Dhanpal! Murder! Teacher! - Ahinsak murdered Dhanpal! - What happened? - Gurumata, Ahinsak killed Dhanpal! - Where's he? He ran away. Gurumata! Inform the king that Ahinsak has committed a murder and run away! The prediction has come true! - What are you saying? - I swear, my lord, it's true. Ahinsak has crossed the gurukul's limits. - He has murdered Dhanpal! - No, this cannot be. This cannot be, my lord. There must be some mistake. There's no mistake. The horoscope was right. - Commander. - Yes, my lord? Send soldiers after Ahinsak. Guard every door in town. Warn the people that anyone who attempts to aid the criminal will die. Destiny works in strange ways. - It's a disaster, princess, a disaster! - What happened? - Ahinsak murdered Dhanpal in the gurukul! - What are you saying? - I've heard, I've heard that Ahinsak, Ahinsak and the gurumata... I'm telling the truth, princess. Maruti has just brought the news... that Ahinsak has run away, and soldiers have been sent after him. What am I hearing? What has happened? God, today is such a good day. My Ahinsak, having completed his education, will return home today. It's such a good day. Perhaps he's come! Coming! - Where's Ahinsak? Where's my Ahinsak? - Forget your Ahinsak now. Throw this away! Extinguish these lamps! All the light has left our lives now. - What are you saying? Has Ahinsak... - He's turned violent. He's murdered Dhanpal and run away from the gurukul. The king has sent soldiers after him. - No, this can't be. This can't happen. - It's happened. All our attempts were in vain. The astrologer's inauspicious words were true. Do you remember what he said? His hands will slice many necks. He brought storm and destruction when he was born... And it will always follow him. Every place he passes through will be destroyed. He will thirst for human blood. Mother Ganges, you are the saviour of the world. Wait for me. I have no one. Wherever I go, people will accuse me, blame me. Give me refuge today, Mother. Hide me in your waves. I'm coming! When the days of sorrow come. When lies win over truth When the clouds of infamy gather over an innocent heart When the winds of injustice hurt your ears Then, oh human, you must chant I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha [Buddhist chant] What a heavenly tone. Are you a gandharv, a transgender, or a god? No, worshipper. I am only a humble follower of the master. - Why are you here? - For your wellbeing. My wellbeing lies in ending my life. I cannot handle any more false accusations. Worshipper, you move from one darkness to another. It is a sin in itself to give yourself to death. Worshipper, you can move from this path to one of goodness. What goodness can one whose life is caught in storms have? Goodness is meant for those who have been injured by sorrow. Forgive me, but my sorrows cannot be soothed by your consolations. Those who dwell in oblivion have no sorrows the lord cannot cure. Then tell me, how can I erase my sorrows? You will have to walk on the path of Sangha. Then I will do so. I will take refuge in him. - Where will Lord Buddha be now? - He will be in his ashram. - Then bless me. - Live well, worshipper. [Buddhist chant] - Who is it? - Your son, Ahinsak. - I have no son. - Father, I'm innocent. - I know that. - Listen to me, father. I don't want to. I heard what the astrologer said when you were born. It was my mistake that I didn't kill you right then. I'm innocent, father. I didn't want to kill Dhanpal. When he falsely accused me, I opposed him... and when he tried to kill me, he died at my hands. Many more will die at your hands. I know it. Don't darken my doorstep with your shadow. Go away! Father, let me meet my mother once. Let me take her blessing. I know a mother will never turn away her son. She doesn't want to look at you. Go away! Father, don't turn me away. Please listen to me. Please open the door! Even my parents have turned against me. I have no one. I have no one in this world. What was that noise? Who were you talking to? - Tell me, who had come? - No one. - How come? Tell me. - Ahinsak. Ahinsak? My Ahinsak came? Where did he go? Who knows? What are you saying? Why did you let him go? Should I have invited him in? He didn't see his gurumata as a mother. He murdered his own brother. - He's your son. - My son is dead! You're saying this? You? Oh, Ahinsak. Hail the goddess! Do you see what humans do? They thirst for innocent blood. Humans are monsters. All these people have been troubled by Ahinsak. He murders people, wears their fingers in a garland, and roams free. - Angulimala (finger garland)? - Yes, that's what they call him now. My lord, based on what they say, he is now a demon, not a human being. - They say he's been possessed. - Maruti, leave with a battalion. Bring him to me, dead or alive. As you say, my lord. But how did so much power fit in such a small body? I don't understand it. What if he's really possessed, and he slices the battalion like vegetables? Maruti! I made you commander because I thought you were brave and intelligent. But I see that I was wrong. My arms are still strong. I can slay that monster myself. Prepare my horse. - Father, I'll go, not you. - Where? After Angulimala? - Yes, father. - Have you gone mad? You'll go after a murderer Maruti fears? Father, arms and armies cannot capture him. - What can? - Sympathy, love, and respect. - Maya! - Father, I'm sure he can change. Our rejection has made him what he is. If... If we fall to his feet and beg him, he'll forgive us. I'm not talking about politics or justice. Although, if you think about it, we're the criminals, not him. We blocked his path and forced him into a life of crime. Who blocked his path? Who forced him? Princess, by siding with the criminal, you're encouraging him to commit crimes. I'm not talking to you, and you cannot understand me. - Nobody sees their own faults. - My lord, she's insulting our politics and justice. I'll leave with the batallion today and bring him to you, dead or alive. Well done, Maruti! Father, stop him! It will be a disaster, father. Stop him. - There's no sign of the monster. - Commander, we're tired. Let's rest here. No! They say he lives around here. Where could that monster be? - Who is it? - Angulimala, you're finished! Where did he go? He must be close by. Light the torch! Spread out. You, come with me. Why do you hide and attack? Why don't you come here? Search for him! He hides and attacks. Why don't you come here? You don't dare to face Maruti. Coward. Come here and I'll show you! Why don't you come out? Why don't you face me? I'm facing you, Maruti. - Ahinsak... - Ahinsak! Call me Angulimala. This isn't the gurukul, Maruti! - Brother, you're my brother, aren't you? - Brother? - Princess? Princess! - Maruti? What happened to you? - That monster did this. Angulimala. - Didn't you bring a battallion? I did. Don't laugh at me, princess. It's your fate and God's mercy that I'm alive. - Come, let's return to the capital. - Coward. Out of my way. Let me go. - Where? Where will you go? - To Ahinsak. - So you still love him? - Love is everlasting, Maruti. - Out of my way! - No! You can't leave me and go to him. I love you with all my life. I've got you now, and I won't let go. - Out of my way! - No! - Let go of me! - No! - He's violent. He'll kill you. - But I won't run like a coward as you did. Maya! - Let go of me. - No. You can't go. You can't escape from me now. - Who, Maruti? - Teacher, forgive me. - What happened to you? - Where's Maya? Where's Ahinsak? - So that sinner did this to you. - No, teacher. I'm the sinner, not Ahinsak. - Forgive me, Ahinsak. Forgive me, teacher. - Forgive? What's the matter, Maruti? I made you hate Ahinsak because I was jealous. Gurumata was pure as the Ganges, but I stigmatized her. I'm the cause of Ahinsak's sins. He's innocent. Gurumata is innocent. Forgive me, teacher. I have paid for my sins. Forgive me. Maruti! Ahinsak! - Who is it? - I? I'm Maya. - Who's Maya? - You don't recognize me, Ahinsak? Ahinsak? Who's Ahinsak? Ahinsak is dead. The princess killed him that night. - Don't say that! - Don't touch me, human. - You're human, too. - I? I'm not human. I'm Angulimala, man's death. Go away. - No. I've come to make you human. - Human? I'll become human? The human inside me is dead. But love has the power to revive the dead. Love? What love? You said that night that there is no love or trust in the world. Where did this love suddenly come from? Love was always there. Love is everlasting. Ahinsak, let's return to the world where humans love each other. Where humans hate each other and falsely accuse them. Where they play with blood. You want me to return to a world with no justice, truth or trust? - Have you gone mad? - You have. You play with people's blood. Ahinsak, is this your truth? Is killing innocents your justice? Nobody is innocent. And who turned me violent? You did! Forgive me. I was mistaken that day. I believed what people said and spoke innappropriately. I never thought what the result would be. I regret it. Ahinsak, I know you can't be heartless. - Maya, I'm bad. Go away. - I won't leave without you. - Go away, I say! - No, I won't. I might attack you. My eyes turn red when I see humans. Then kill me, too. Leave before Angulimala is accused of murdering a woman. Leave? How can I leave when I've found my destination? I'll take you with me or die at your hands. The eyes that see you like this should be closed forever. - Leave! - No, no, no! Ahinsak... Where am I? Ahinsak! Ahinsak? Save us from Angulimala, king! - We want to meet the king! - We want Angulimala's blood! - Give us justice, king! - Save us from Angulimala, king! Have mercy, lord! Please calm down. I've got the news. Angulimala's time is up. I'll leave with a battalion today and kill that monster. Hail the king! Forgive me, I can't wait any longer. I want to see my son. God, protect my Ahinsak. Who should I call for when my listener won't listen to me? This heartless world has never understood love When heartlessness overpowers mercy... when the inferior human forgets his lord... when truth fears and faith stumbles... then, oh human, you must chant... I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha I take refuge in Buddha. - Princess! Maya! You? - Gurumata. Forgive me, Gurumata. I thought badly of you. This is of no use now, princess. By God's grace, my dishonor has gone. - The world knows what the truth is. - Really? Yes, princess. The news has come from Shravasti. - Then the gurukul... - No, Maya. I will serve the lord all my life now. The merciful Lord Buddha will soon take me under his wing. But Maya, how are you here in this condition? Gurumata, I've left my royal life to beg Lord Buddha for mercy. Not for myself, but for Ahinsak. Only Lord Buddha's pure love can save him. A ray of his mercy will reform him. I'll wash the lord's feet with my tears... And pray to him to save my Ahinsak. Reform Angulimala. Maya, you're tired. Rest for a bit, then we'll visit Lord Buddha. - Alright. - Come. Who is it? A human? Thirsting for my blood? My garland has 999 fingers. This kill will make it 1000. The royal astrologer's prediction will come true. Your blessings will come true, teacher. I take refuge in Buddha When all love leaves the world... when the walls of hatred rise... when a mother's love is returned by her son's sword... when the earth quakes and the sky trembles... then, oh human, you must chant... I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha What is this magic? Who are you? Come here! [Buddhist chant] So you're the magician. Wait, I'll kill you first. Stop! Why are you running? Stay still! I'm still. You're not. You're running. I'm running? The world runs from me, and so do you. No. Those who know religion, love, peace and mercy fear no one. I don't believe in religion, love, peace and mercy. To allow insects to live and protect animals, you must have mercy and love. You're the first to say this. Everyone else hates me. - Everyone thirsted for my blood. - Is that why you're violent? Why shouldn't I? I'll avenge everything they've done to me. The fire in my heart will cool down only when I've eradicated humans. Fire is cooled with water, not more fire. Love cancels out hatred, not more hatred. [Buddhist chant] Always remember that humans can be won over with love, not with weapons. - I don't understand your empty words. - I'll explain them. - Take a leaf from the twig. - Now what? Now put it back. It's impossible. It is injustice to kill what you cannot revive. Think, how many mothers have you made childless? How many infants have you orphaned? How many women have you widowed? How many old people have you made helpless? Don't be disheartened, child. You can only see light with open eyes. Go, love everyone. This is your atonement. But society has rejected me. No one loves me. - I do. - What did you say? You love me? Those who are rejected have truly earned my love. Who are you, with a voice that drips with nectar? Gautam. They call me Buddha. Lord Buddha, purest of the pure? Take me under your wing. Enlighten me, lord. I certainly will, but you must apologize to the world first. Love those you have hurt, and beg them for love. Only then will you be worthy of the world's love. As you wish, lord. I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha. - Who is it? - Don't fear me. I am Ahinsak now, not Angulimala. - Ahinsak? - Who, mother? Ahinsak! I looked for you everywhere. You've changed so much. Yes, mother, I've changed completely. Today I've seen Lord Buddha and my mother. I'm blessed, lord. At last you've heard my prayers. - Ahinsak, come home now. - Home? What home, mother? The whole world is my home now. Lord Buddha has given me refuge. Under him, I will wash away my sins and apologize to everyone. - I'll love everyone. - Where you were bad, you were only mine. Now, when you're good, you're no longer mine. Yes, mother, I was only yours until now. Now, I belong to the world. Bless me, mother, so that I am victorious. How can we forgive someone guilty of numerous murders? My lord, I am the criminal, not Ahinsak. I should be punished. No, my lord. The real criminal is the father... who kicked out his son and forced him into sin. Praise the king. We've searched the entire forest, but we couldn't find Angulimala. Is this a joke? You couldn't find one man in all this time? I order you to bring him to the capital before sunset. Father, Ahinsak has reached a place punishment cannot reach. Maya, you? Where were you all this while? Father, your forgiveness doesn't matter now. Lord Buddha himself has given him refuge. Punishment cannot even touch him now, father. What are you saying? Weapons and soldiers couldn't overpower him... - but love did. - But how will the people be pacified? Father, he's gone to ask them for forgiveness. Daughter! Angulimala! Run! Angulimala has come! Listen to me. Don't fear me. I've come to apologize. Please forgive me. Don't be afraid. Lord Buddha extinguished the fire of enmity and violence in my heart... with the cool water of love and peace. I now know that love erases hatred, not more hatred. I've come here to love you and ask for you love. - Give it to me. - Murder this murderer! [Buddhist chant] We've caught him with great difficulty. Hit him! - No! - Move away, princess. Forgive him. Don't hit him. He is no longer Angulimala. He's Ahinsak once again. He's taken numerous lives. He can't escape today. Quiet! What are you doing? It's a sin to hit him. - Ahinsak, forgive me. - What are you doing? Maruti told me everything. I pushed you towards sin. - Forgive me. - Don't say that, teacher. If you hadn't kicked me out that day... how would I have reached Lord Buddha? - Allow me, princess. - I'm coming, too. - Where? - To Lord Buddha. Our paths are the same. I take refuge in Buddha. I take refuge in Dhamma. I take refuge in Sangha. The one who has extinguished darkness from restless hearts Whose one ray has lit up the world May the lamp of truth remain lit May mercy and peace flourish May his love remain where joy and peace reside May Lord Buddha's chant echo in every household Oh human, chant every day I take refuge in Buddha I take refuge in Dhamma I take refuge in Sangha
