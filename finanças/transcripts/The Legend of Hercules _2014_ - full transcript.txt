Accepts save these men? King Anfitrion, I accept the challenge. Prepare to die! O Anfitrion! O Anfitrion! The invasion ends here for now. Chiron told me that invaded Egypt because they attacked our ships. It's true. But Argos, our neighbor posed no threat. I see you expanded your Quiron curricula. I do not need no teacher tell me when there is peace. Argos raided by you. For me? You invaded by gold from Argos. Yes, that too. But I learned that here are obsessed with gods as you. If they had as many soldiers as priests... Today... my body would be the that would burn at the stake. Called, Your Majesty? How is spending the Prince Iphicles? To teach you, Chiron? Will teach you about the war? Could not ignore it, Your Majesty. The story is nothing more than a chronicle of the war. War is only one chronic pain... counted in the tears of... mothers who lose their children. Sometimes, His Majesty... I wonder... who is the teacher, and who the student here. My own vanity made?? me think who could teach the tenderness... a man whose thirst for power is insatiable. And only grows with each victory. Neither the wrath of the Gods could cause so much misery... like... what my King has caused these lands. So bow down before thee, Goddess. It frees us from this curse... and... help my people. Your Majesty! Hera accepted his offer. The Goddess Hera? Queen Alcmene, approach. His Majesty, no! Closer. Let me look at you. You will be liberating. It will be another child of your womb. No, please, another child with him, no. Please Goddess... Tell me, are you able to cheat the King thy .. As well as my... betrays me to want you? You are able to have with him a mortal son to appease your pain... and bring peace to this land? You can bring in your womb the son of Zeus? For peace, yes, I would. So for peace, I'll allow. Put the name you want, but for me it will be Hercules. Hercules. Where is? Who is? Who is this man for whom disdains me, night after night? Your Majesty, please! Who is your lover? My King! An attacker! Search the camp! The find! Find! - Speaks. - It's a boy, sir. Great sound and a child. Her name is Sally... and never will be... standing equality with his older brother. Hercules. His name is Hercules. 20 YEARS LATER Care has snakes in the trees! - I did not know you were afraid of them! - Beware! Than most afraid of? Only one thing, since forever. Your departure, each single time. It is another private cache? Wait. I think you'll like. Alcides! Not! Alcides! Lost something? I almost fainted with fright! Come on, come on. I like your necklace. My mother gave this as parting gift to my father. And how it is now with Gods... I want to give... for you. It is just a stone... but... I wanted it to be gold. There was something more precious that makes you remember me. And there. In my imagination. It is etched your face since the first time I saw you. Be careful, brother. Your horse could have tripped. You be careful, brother. Princess, your father is concerned. He sent an expedition to find you. Glad you knew where to find us. Yes, although we would have preferred have the luck of others. Princess, left without saying a word. And what word would allowed me to leave? Captain, follow the Princess the palace. Tonight is a feast and she should not arrive late. Yes, my Prince. No, brother. You come with me. We'll see tonight. I saw the footprints of horses in the woods. What would you have done if she fell and broke his neck? Thought I knew better. It is more likely that I broke his neck. Today I saw more than footprints of horses. Have you seen? If control! I saw you while you Mature and intentions! I'm older than you, Alcides, and inherit the throne! Let's rewind slowly. Do not turn the horse. - No, we will flee. Your horse is faster. - Your not. What are you doing? - Now turn around behind me. - Yes, of course. What a brave story will have to tell tonight the next King of Tiryns! Iphicles, the idea was that a we could run away! The Lion of Nemea. The devourer of men unbeatable. Our spears are useless! Alcides! Iphicles! Where were you? What's this? Get him. I think it is the skin a lion of Nemea. The lion is killed just two hours. Look, hurt me here. You see, Dad? But I'm fine . not caught in my eye. Where was your brother right now? Alcides? Ran before the first sign of danger. Have you ever seen my brother flee from danger? Ever seen, princess? No, never. I thought I knew better. Tell them! Father! Thus the time required to give that even the most foolish understand. My friend, King Talas, the Brave, Lord of Crete... now... all enjoy the free trade between our kingdoms. Tonight we will make it a offer far more important. The peace between our families will sealed within four moons... during harvest... the full moon, when Prince Iphicles, my heir... marry... Princess of Crete! Yes! Hebe! Hebe for! Why not explain to me what just happened? I think the news surprised him, father. The only surprise is that you let behave in such manner. Doing nothing, lion hunter. And what could they have done? 'M Anfitri�n the Conqueror... King... of these lands, the victor of Argos. And you are my son, but today stood looking... as your future wife... ridiculed both... in front of our large threat: Crete. Look at them. This weakens you. I want to be a man. Are you the next King of Tiryns. Behave like one! Hebe! Hebe, stop! Stop it! Stop it! Come on. I will not marry him. I'd rather die. Love you. And I love you. I need you to be strong. Will you be strong? Wanna run away with you tonight. If we can cross the River toward Tiga... the King's men... not more may follow. Behind them! Runs, Hebe! Westward! No, I will not let you! I 'll chase you. Run! Behind them! You two, after her! Now! Fast! You heard! Do not hurt the Prince! Above! There! - Stop it! - Alcides! Hebe! Help! Alcides! Help! Alcides! Alcides! Captain Sotiris! The room is ready battalion to leave tomorrow? 160 are men, His Highness, ready as you ordered. Good will take half. Nothing more. Half? It's a young man. Learn to command 80 men, and see if we increase the numbers. Do not you agree? No, Your Highness. We will be the winners and will honor your name. I got him, Dad! Are saying that you do not agree with the deal we made. This agreement may spoil if before harvest harvest moon. I do not believe. Tomorrow will ship to Egypt. There is an uprising in Heliopolis north of the Nile delta. Enjoy the war, Alcides, and forget all this. Do not fear for your life. May the gods of your mother you thereto, if any. Ask him about Hebe. One last question. Your brother is obsessed with the idea... that... you stole virginity of the maiden. Why not say it that is not true? I will. Again I tell you, my brother... that... is not your problem. Desire endless triumphs Te on the battlefield, my brother. Why come back here, I'll kill you. Alcides, beg you understand... that... you have a mission on this earth, more important than this desire. There is nothing more important than retrieving my love! Curse the king to deny me this right, and curse the gods for distancing her from me! - Hercules! - Your Majesty, do not! What did you call me? You are no son of Anfitri�n. I swear by my mother's love you 're Hercules. The gift of Hera, the son of Zeus. - Chiron. - My Prince. Did my mother told it to someone else? No, I assure you not. Because the King is a Jealous man... and certainly believe... this madness. Open the gates! Out of the way! Climb in the back! Alcides! Stop it! Resist, my love! 'll Be back sooner than you expect! And you will marry me! In three moons! What worries you? First, the King commanded me that takes the whole battalion... but then the reduced for half. There are no armies on the march. In Crete there is peace. Two divisions were idle in camp. Why does the fool denies me the lowest excess soldiers? We do not know what we Waiting in Heliopolis! The step of Horus. We arrive at dusk and camp. There has to be another way. Not only changed the amount of men but also the route. Your father wants us to get Heliopolis the day before. In front of explorers! There is enough water for everyone! Fresh and clean. Any news of the exploiters? Long time left. We'll camp here. Feed men and horses. We need 20 volunteers walk... to ensure... step. They say that the golden eagle is a portent of Zeus. Yes And others say only one bird. Sotiris. Soldiers, returning to camp. The direct brought to death. Back! Backtrack! The same way! Battle Formation! Turtle Training! Archers! Archers! In training! - Only two of us are left! - I want them alive! Commander, Tarak. Here! The helmet of the Prince. Who is the captain? I. And this is the helmet of Prince named Alcides? - Is it? - Yes Where is he? Where is he? Ali You killed him. Take this to the King Captain, you have willpower... but... this man, even half dead... is... twice as strong that my best fighter. If I thought would survive, sell them for a decent amount of a Prince. But I suppose they want a dignified death of a soldier. On sale. Survive. Who are you, soldier? Hercules. The chilled for you. The pain will be much greater there where you are going. Did the King is able to do this? Sacrificing his men to ensure the death of a? From his own son! Why did you choose to live? Is aware of the commitment... between my brother... and Hebe, Princess of Crete? Yes, the announced before we left. I return there before the wedding. You stand by my side... and... will be the guest of honor... the party... my wedding. I fear that my Prince has passed too much time inside the palace. I have contested the world... - And I know what awaits us. - You are wrong. Surely someone has by whom back. Sure. My wife and my son. So think of them. And nothing more! Tell me. Who is this Hercules? Still do not know. Mother? Are you sick? I look sick? Often when he sees me. What nonsense. You are my son. What remains alive. But I feel more missing than the one who died. Iphicles, both are grieving. But in this sea of?? pain should be at least one drop of joy. I will get married in three moons. Yes. You are right. You got a beautiful bride. Yes a bride, but will have gained a wife? It will be profitable for you. So this is my hope? Mom, I need to do to win her, like my dad you won? Please 'm not Alcides. I know. Not for her, not for you. Your father got me just a moment... so brief that already... do not even remember. That's what will have to Hebe. This is the result... a wedding that... she does not want... and... the death of your brother. I paid a lot for both of you. I hope you give me feedback. Hercules, what happens? It is the first full moon. And she did not even know I'm alive. Come on! Miserable! Told me that Sicilians had money! Who wants to bet on Sotiris? Death! Tell me, friend, You can leave here winning? Sure. There. It's your turn, Greek. You better win, the same way as your friend... or perhaps you prefer... swallowing mud. You said to stay by your side. I say that we're doomed. I promise I 'll take you back to your family. Death! Asked to see me. Here I am. Thanks for coming... Hera... to bless marriage. Because staring at me? You found peace, Alcmene? If you told me how my son found death, I find peace. Will you tell me how he found life? Yes. Yes, Anfitri�n finally I'll tell you. It was my son... I knew it! - Do not you dare deny it! - I will not deny. Who is the father? Tell me! Did you know? - How many lovers have you had? - A! - Bullshit! - I had a lover, a single night... and... with one goal: Finally his reign! - Tell me who! - Zeus! Zeus came to my bed and planted his seed in me... to generate the son... that would end their tyranny! You murdered son the God of Gods... and now... you're doomed. Doomed! You are doomed. Not! The Queen... in his pain... he took life itself. Today made?? me gain a fortune, Hercules. These trifles not interest me. - A man very profitable. - "Very profitable ." If you want to make a fortune in fact, causes us to Greece. Greece? In the realms of Greece... attract thousands... your games. Already attract thousands here. - Thousands of laughter, you mean. - Laughter? What do you mean? Allow me to explain. In the land of King Anfitri�n... the sport is war and War is sport. And between the two, the King .. Is the leading provider... Hades. Once a year, organize an event... the most elaborate, magnificent and luxurious. Remember, it is not for your tip. No, it's too pure. Nobody has dragged through the mud, or dancing over wooden beams. None of that. Men only stop on dry land... with bronze weapons... Forged formats... that... or the same tyrant could have imagined. - And how are the stakes? - How are the stakes? My friend, I doubt that even be able to imagine it. In the last fight, for example, which is... the richest... certainly... two men fight... against six. Six who have never been defeated. If victorious, these two get freedom. But all bets against. - That would be advantageous, surely. - If you win. You gain a good amount of gold. And why would you two? Because we never lose. They did not. He could not be more giddy, or beheaded. To fight you need have strength and brain. Be careful what you say, buddy. I'll organize the largest spectacle of Sicily. You two against Meiacara and Humbaba. Winners will board a ship... me..., towards Greece. And now, the event that everyone expected! Four undefeated champions of Sicily... struggle to get to... more grand tournament in Greece! I present to fierce... and terrifying ...: Meiacara and Humbaba! And his challengers: Hercules of Tiryns and Sotiris! Hercules! Humbaba! Death! Sotiris! Pluck throat him, Humbaba! Hercules! Hercules! Are you crazy? He is injured. You killed the only man who could replace him. - I can still fight, Lucio! - Yes! Against the top six Fighters from Greece. It is the same as suicide. The deal 's off. - They will return to the arena tomorrow. - Do not fight. Unless Greece. So will die. Go ahead, kill us. Who will fight for your money? Dare to threaten me? In fact you lose his two best fighters? To get your money back, no risk a single silver coin... damn... its miserable miser! Look at you! Can barely walk! You 're useless! For I will take you? - To release him. - No, Hercules. I will face them. Alone. Goes against certain death. We have two more days of travel! Since we boarded, not left the bow. We olives the size of melons chickens as big as dogs. My name is Sotiris, Captain of the Fourth Battalion. I went towards Heliopolis with Prince. But just surviving another man and me. The other is a person of great renown. Is called Hercules. A man came to our land! A slave... called... Hercules! Is supposed to be the " Sun of Hera!" The refund not in human form, but a pile of guts and bones... for dogs... the Olympus devoured! I present to you: Hercules! Fight for your freedom... against... the six undefeated champions grandest of Greece! Commander. Captain. See with your own eyes. They say this is the Prince Alcides? It's himself, you're with us?

Sotiris And you, you know also wants to see someone. Soon will. Tell him how you are army morale. Reigns a great distrust since his troops were lost. The King is impoverishing his people outsiders to hire mercenaries. I'll contact our officers more reliable. They heed our call. And my brother, will be on our side? Are your men who plunder the villages. And your payment are fruits of plunder. I think we need to win... this... King and others. Chiron should not say anything to Hebe. She can not hide their happiness. Now, "Gift of Hera ." Gather all your strength, for I must tell you something. I have terrible news about his mother. She is no longer with us. Found dead in his own dagger. I even pulled out of his chest... when... the King fled the temple. In his last breath, pronounced your name. The King will pay for it. His men will support us? Now are thy men. And will support you. Like me. Out of my way, woman! Skirt woman! Move! On behalf of the King will take their property. - Please do not! - Now! On your knees! Really need four to steal a single man? Get your swords! Put the guns down. Is it true? You 're Hercules, God? No, I'm only a man. It's time to send a Message to the King Now I understand why his men prefer to defect, Iphicles. 536:13,345... > 00:57:15,397 - I just know! - What? On these three incompetent imbeciles? That 's a riot on our doorstep? His Majesty said Sotiris, Captain of the Fourth Battalion, returned. It is he who is ahead the deserters. Father, I will assume this responsibility. Let me find Sotiris. Will I take us to Hercules. Tomorrow, when our allies arrive Egypt, Germania and East Africa... Sotiris..., Hercules, and even Zeus himself will turn into memories. What is this place? Captain Sotiris has prepared. This house will serve as a refuge as we prepare. The woman who is there inside says he knows you.

Yes, it's Alcides. - While everyone knows by... - Hercules. Yes, I know . was present when they gave him his name. My friend says he lived in Argos when my father turned his anger there. Your father poured his wrath on many... but... what happened at Argos was the work of a mortal. - Where have you brought me? - Until the truth, Hercules. The truth about you. You can retrieve your bride and spend thousands days of running, but it makes no difference. Your destiny is beyond that. Your path in life will take you farther than love... than you can imagine.

Only then can open the door of your true potential. Accept your father and will discover... powers... who ever thought existed. Where was this good father when 80 men died beside me? Where were you when murdered my mother? Your father was always there, Hercules. Zeus can not change mentality of deadly... but... gave a gift to you. And I warn you that if it abusares, will lead you to destruction. If respeitares, will be the salvation for you and your loved ones. You will accept me. Will love me. We will have children... and will love... all equally! Do you understand? Also! Iphicles. Take me back to my home. Take me along my father. Gods do not want be married. I do not want be married.
