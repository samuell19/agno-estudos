Promises there can be very false. - How is having a community false? - Because it's not a community! Not for real. I mean, humans being together, that's a community, not some culture based on how many likes or followers we can get. - I guess so, but there has to be some good in it. Social media is here to stay, Mom. - Yeah, it can be a great tool for reaching people, I just... I just think we need balance. I mean, too much of the stuff desensitizes us to reality.

(door closing) - (Rick): Watch your head. There we go. - Where am I? What happened? - I think she'll be fine. Just, uh... just call me. If you need anything, OK, call me. - Thanks, Rick. I'll see you at school tomorrow. - Yeah. See you. - Bye. (engine revving up) (ominous music) - (Doreen): Hmm, my head. - Hey there. Feeling better? - What happened? - You slipped on the stairs. - I think you just had one too many. - Yeah. I think you're right about that. Aw, man, from now on, no more drinking. Not another drop. I never want to lose control like that again. - I have to get home. Are you sure Doreen will be OK? - She just needs some sleep and an A.A. meeting. - OK. - Um, before you go, I wanted to give you this. - Your business plan? - It's a management agreement. - Ohhh... Um... wow! - It means we'd be partners. Will you look it over? - I will. You take care of your cousin, OK? - She's a tough cookie. - OK. Good night. - Night. (creepy music) - Aaah... (drawer closing) - Not anymore. Never again. We're not finished, Skylar. Not by a long shot. - You're getting popular really fast. I saw your blog and your profile; you're over 10,000 followers now. - Skylar's been promoting me. She's really good at finding kids online with certain interests. She even has a contract all worked out. Look. - Interesting. Do you mind if I look this over? I want to make sure it's fair. - OK, Mom, but... you should know... the fashion thing is what I want to do with my life. There are so many girls out there who have no idea how special they are. I want to show them that they can be special... that it was inside them all along. - Honey, that's... really beautiful. And I'll support you whatever you want to do. I think it's really cool actually. - Thanks, Mom. (Ding!) - Notes on Jessica Lake. It's progressing as planned. I project at least 50K followers within a 2-week time. By then, we can expect offers from at least two major clothing companies, who I'm already in touch with. That should translate to revenues of at least 10K within the second month. Then, once 200,000 followers are reached, we can pick our marques. Basically, Ms. Lake is the perfect online influencer, a working-class celebrity so speak. And she's all mine. OK! OK! Let's give our best girl a little breathing room. She's got another event coming up very soon, and we'll keep you all posted when it happens. - We love you, Jessica! (girls screaming) - Oh, don't forget! Two pages on I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream by Friday. - (boy): Alright. - (whispering): Two minutes, OK? - So, I watched that video you did last night. It was really fun! You have a way with that stuff. - Thanks, Mom. I really love doing it. - And I also, um, looked over that contract Skylar gave you. - Uh-ohhh! (disquieting music) - Just hear me out. This.... agreement is very pointed, very specific. Do you realize she's asking you for a 10-year term? - Yeah, that's a long time. - And that's just the part I could understand. The rest is written in this ironclad legalese that even I can't pronounce, and I'm an English teacher. - Haha! - Now, I'm serious. She had a lawyer draw that up, or a team of lawyers, and I'd like to have somebody look it over who knows exactly what it means. Will you at least give me time to do that? - OK, Mom. No harm in being too careful. But don't worry so much. - I don't mean to be so serious. I really am proud of you. - Hmm. - Alright, get to class, superstar. - Bye, Mom. (sighing) - Hey, girl! Are you around in a bit? I have some stuff I want to run by you. - Jessica: [No problem.] - OK. Awesome! I... I'll be there in about half an hour. ♪♪♪ (exhaling) (glass shattering noise) Aaah, Doreen... Is that my mother's crystal vase in pieces on the floor there? - Yeah. I guess it is. Oops! - You're gonna have to stop screwing up like this. - Those are your mother's things, Skylar. You only have them because she's dead. Just like you only have any money because she's dead. I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Just like I've been thinking a lot about what happened the other night. - Doreen, you were plastered. - Well, sure, but I am damn sober now, and I'm starting to remember a few things. Like... you were really, really angry at me. You've been a scheming brat your whole life, and I know you keep secrets. - Doreen... clean up that mess, and I'll see you later. - Yeah, I'll clean up that mess alright. - Who the hell do you think you are, drunk loser bitch?! - I didn't lie to you, Skylar... I did go to the library, but I wasn't using the Internet. I was doing my homework. Man, I should have never taken what happened at face value. Not like the police did. - Miguel is willing to sponsor whatever we want to do, so here's the way I see it. We select two or three girls from school, fans of J-Lake TV, and we'll shoot you supervising their makeovers. It'll be awesome. Then, we'll follow that up with five more appearances. One each week, new makeover girl every time. - That's a lot of videos. - Well, this is our career calling. Your last video went through the roof. We can make enough from endorsements that it could pay for your college and guarantee our future together. Hmmm? Have you had a chance to look at our management agreement yet? I was hoping we might sign today. - I'm OK with everything. - Mm-hmm. - My mom just wants a lawyer to go over it first. (ominous music) That's cool, right? - Of course, that's cool. Ha ha!

Congratulations. (chuckling) ♪♪♪ OK, you have beautiful hair. Already have beautiful colour. These curls. So her hair was longer before, but we just brought it up. Maybe one side or both, but we're just gonna do one today. We're just gonna add some volume. You can't even tell that we put an extension. A little bit straighter at the ends... What do you think? - I love it! - You know, it's going in a tiny bit at the ends as well. The hair falling down super long and straight. Are you excited? And she's got beautiful natural volume. And we gave her so much texture! - I feel so healthy. - I know! So we gave you a leave-in treatment. So what it does, it just really makes your hair nice and healthy at the ends, from any kind of heat styling that it's been through. Are we happy? - Oh yeah, so happy. (girls laughing) - Let us know what you think out there. And be proud! You're watching J-Lake TV! (girls cheering) - OK, people! Well, that's it for tonight, but please keep your eyes on J-Lake TV, we're full of surprises. - I love all of you! - Thank you. - Hey, I just wanted to say thank you, Jess. Honestly, I have not felt this beautiful in a really, really long time. - Aww, you are beautiful inside and out. - Thank you! (cell phone ringing) - It's your mama. - Hi, Mom. Did you see the live stream? It went really well. - [I'm really proud of you, honey.] But it's getting late, I want you to come home soon. - OK. See you in a bit. - I do not understand, Jessica. We have big problems here. You failed both of your do-over tests, and they're not gonna let you take them again. - I'm sorry, Mom. It's just been so crazy. - Spent two days getting those girls ready for that video, and you barely cracked open a book. I see where this is going, and it's not good! (sighing) OK, listen. I want you to hear me, Jessica. I am happy that things are going so well for you, but I want you to have a real life. - I think I can decide for myself what kind of life I want. - Honey, you are just 17 years old. - And in two weeks, I'll be 18. And then a year after that, I'll be 19. So what's your point? - My point is you are failing out of school, and I am still your mother! - Fine. ♪♪♪ (sighing) - Six figures, we're on our way, Jess. On our way. ♪♪♪ What the hell are you doing in here, Doreen? This is my room! - Hi, cousin. I saw the big event went well. I've been doing some digging. I went to the library, like you said. See this? This is a listing for the showtimes for the theatre you were supposedly at the night poor Aunt Annie was killed right here in this house. I was at work. Convenient, huh? - Just stop talking, Doreen. - No, you, stop talking and listen. In the statement you gave the police, you were at a movie that night. Well, you were careful because these guys don't have a website and the showtimes aren't listed. Not on the Internet. But I found this in the newspaper archives. It says there wasn't even a movie playing that night. It was a live event. And I'm sure this is all the police would ever need to look deeper into what happened. And you don't want that. Do you? You came back here and you killed her that night, didn't you? You hated her anyway. So you did her in, and you got the insurance money and the house. And I can prove you did it. (foreboding music) I might even be able to prove you had something to do with that Monica Davis girl. I saw you sneak out the night she died. - And what do you want? - Oh, we're partners now. Like I said before, I get half of whatever you do with that Jessica girl or... guess what happens. Alright, well, I'm gonna go to my night shift, and when I get back, we're gonna talk about our new business venture. 50-50. (knocking on door) (sniffling) - Honey, can I come in? - I guess. - I hate fighting with you. It's not like us. - Mom, I just... I don't know what's happening. How did something so cool turn so complicated? - The world is complicated. That doesn't mean we have to let it beat us. (soft music) - Dad used to say that. Sometimes, I miss him so much. (sniffling) ♪♪♪ - Ugh! (laceration) Skylar... (stab) Ah! Argh! - You were never my partner, Doreen. You were never anything. ♪♪♪ No one else came. Doreen's mom ran off a long time ago. She was very lonely. Wish I could have helped more. - It's so tragic. Did the police have any leads? - No. They said that muggings are really bad in that area, and there were no witnesses, so... ...time to put it all past us, I guess. - Of course. - I'm... I'm sorry to bring this up now, but did you sign our management agreement? We need to get official, your big thing at the Teen Club is tomorrow night. (eerie music) - Well, we have a lawyer looking the papers over. To be honest, I-I hadn't really thought about it much with everything that's been going on. I'm so sorry for you, Skylar. - I'm sorry too. But we need to move forward. Doreen would have wanted it that way. - Honey, I think we can take this up at a more appropriate time. - OK, Mom. - Of course. - Call me later. Let me know you're doing alright, OK? - I will. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. I need to go sign some papers. - Mm-hmm. (cell phone ringing) - It's Rick. Hi, Rick. - Hey, Jess. Um, I just heard about Skylar's cousin. Are you guys doing OK? - [We're still at the funeral.] I'm really glad you called. - [Yeah, I just got back in town.] You want to get together? Talk? - [That would be nice. I have my big party tomorrow night.] Would you go with me? I'd really like it if you did. - Yeah, I'd love to. I'll pick you up at 7. - [OK.] Dress kind of fancy. It'll be like senior prom, only more rock and roll. (eerie music) - Good riddance, cousin. Now, I'm in charge. I beat you all. Mother, Doreen, Monica, I won. - I know Skylar's very focused, very business minded, but she didn't even cry back there. Not one tear. She just spoke business with you. - Well, don't we all deal with death in different ways? - That's true, but death has a way of following that girl around. The same thing happened to her mother. Almost the exact same thing. You just met her, Jessica. You only know what she's chosen to tell you about herself. I just... I have a bad feeling about this. ♪♪♪ - So, I want you all out there to know how much it means to me and Skylar that you sent so many well wishes about her cousin.

It... it could be very important. - [Yeah. I suppose so.] (knocking on door) - Hey, you. - Sorry I didn't call. I've been thinking about some things, can we talk? - Of course we can. Mom went to the store, so it's just us. - Oh, good. Um, I saw your post this afternoon, and it was so sweet. Doreen's death has made me realize a few things. One of them is that life is short. - I'm so sorry for you, Skylar. We're all here for you. - I'm glad to hear that because I think we should be roommates. When we finish school. - Roommates? - Well, it's perfect. We graduate next year, and by then you're gonna be huge. We'll both have a lot of money, so I'm thinking loft in New York. We'll run my business out of it, we'll recruit other talent, we'll have them live there too. It'll be our own little empire, Jessica. Oh, we'll be rich. - Wow! I... I'm not sure what to say to that. It's a big step. - Well, we have plenty of time to sort it all out. It's what I do: I take money and turn it into more money investments. That's what my mother could never understand, Jessica. That's what makes us perfect for each other: you understand what is important! - I understand that you've suffered a terrible loss. And I think we should talk about all this another time. You're being very intense-- - Jessica... ...I am your manager, it is my job to be intense sometimes. We need to be smart and prepared for the future. We must seize the day, yes?

That's all that Skylar wanted her to do. And Monica became seduced by it. One night, she came home late... and she'd been drinking and she'd never done that before. And she started to cry.

Skylar, why are you doing this?! - Shh, shh, shhhh, shhh... Think of it as a... pre-emptive disciplinary measure. You have to learn who the boss is. It's me, Jessica. I'm in charge. I rule you! MEEEE! (screaming) (gasping) - OK, so maybe Skylar is a control freak, maybe she's even a little scary; that doesn't mean she killed someone though. - That kid is trouble. Something tells me you know it too, deep down. - She was so different last night, when she came here. I know that has to be why I had that nightmare, but murder, Mom? - Monica fell from a balcony at a party, and two other people in Skylar's life have died... violently. Either it's a morbid series of coincidences or... ...something bad is going on here. - Do you think we should go to the police? - No. There's no real evidence.

I mean, anything at all? There was a girl named Skylar Madison who might have come to visit. She had long, dark hair. - You know, people are in and out of the hospital all the time.
