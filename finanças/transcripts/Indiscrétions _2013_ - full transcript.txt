Well done. Well done. No, no. Buy what you want with it. Go on. Oh, my darling. Bye, sweetie. Did Camille pay you for the lesson? I know her. She's likely to hang onto the money to buy rubbish with. Hello, Clémence. Enjoying the sunshine? Yes, yes. Felicidade, thank you for the mail. You're welcome. Glad to help. There. - Is it already time for my shot? - Yes. Come along. You'll be the death of me. Oh, no. All right, let's go. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Salim Belkacemi, the new tenant. I'll get you the keys, Mr Belkacemi. You'll see, it's a nice place. OK. - Come through. - Thanks. It's nice. Thank you. Hasn't anyone told you curiosity is a terrible defect? It's hardly a defect. At least I don't gaze at my navel. In our jargon it's called a scopic impulse. How dreadful! And what is it in normal parlance? Wanting control over a world that frightens one, live a vicarious sex life, or simply... Looking for a penis. What a damning list! But be aware that, as a piano teacher, I have a good grasp of reality. Ah, Mona called me in tears this morning. - Her boyfriend left her. - It's always the same. She disappears for months and calls you when she hits rock bottom. - She visits when she can. - Once a year. - She's never around. You know that. - You always find excuses for her. I've known Mona for 15 years. I love her and I know she loves me too. You seem to forget how hateful she was when we met. She was afraid you'd come between us. That's what bothers me about her. She won't feel happy for you. She was just 15. I was all she had. Now she has her own life. She's changed. People never change. - Are you around this evening? - I'm on night duty. Sorry. - What will you do? - I don't know. I need a change of air. I wish we could leave together, far from all this shit. There's no need to run away to forget. I forget nothing. Neither the happy moments with you nor the rest. I wish things were different between you and Benjamin. I couldn't bear him treating you as if you were ill. But I was ill, Mona. He cured me. - Do you really love him? - He's always been there for me. - He's a nice guy, you know. - You're right. I'm a fool. He's on night shift at the hospital. Come stay at the house. We'll spend the evening together. We'll eat crisps all night, watching DVDs. You've improved a lot. Do you often play? I always find time for it. - Have you started composing again? - Oh, this? It's nothing special. It's so beautiful. - Why do you keep it hidden? - You know why. Benjamin, as soon as I start composing... Does he worry as a husband or a shrink? - Don't start. - OK. Not saying anything. That boy can't stop looking at you. Sure he's looking at me? I don't know why, but that guy scares me. - I find him rather sexy. - Stop making light of things. And you stop worrying about me. I'd worry less if you weren't so pretty. Hello? OK. OK, I'll meet you later. It was Paolo. - He wants to talk. - Go. I'm sure it'll sort itself out. I hope so. In any case, I'll spend the night here. I promise. I'll buy some croissants tomorrow. Bye, my darling. Hey, take my keys. - You still have it? - Of course I do. Look at these. They don't look like fish or like horses. When they swim, they look like floating twigs. They should keep a low profile. But they do the opposite. They stand proud, with their tiny crown on their heads. Shall I tell you why? They're proud to be different. Later you gave me that key ring, saying I was different too. Admit you're proud of it. See you tonight. Come, Mr Lefort, let's go back in. It's cold. Yes, it is cold. Clémence! Clémence! Mona? Mona, call me as soon as you get this. Benjamin, call me. I'm sure something's happened to Mona. Hello, police? Hello? So, you think you heard a cry. - That's all. - I heard my name. She was crying for help, I'm sure of it. Listen, ma'am, it's three in the morning. If you want my full attention, I'll need more input. - I've told you all I know. - That's not what I mean. I meant I'd like a drink. Your mother didn't teach you manners. - Sorry. What would you like? - That's better. A whisky. Irish? - Will bourbon do? - I knew we wouldn't get on. I don't mind people who drink too much. I just don't trust those who drink badly. Go on, pour, pour, pour. We don't know each other well, so take it on trust, it's best not to cross me when I'm sober. So, let's get back to business. Who is Mona Beccaria? One of my oldest pupils. I'm a piano teacher. - You invite your pupils to stay? - Mona's different. She turned up when she was eight. I heard the piano. Could you teach me how to play? Of course. Come. If she went to see her boyfriend, why do you think she's not still there? She could be drunk, under a table. Best place to be, don't you think? She promised to come home. I gave her my keys. But she preferred to stay with this... Paolo. Amazing! - You OK? - Yes. It must be the sleeping pills I took. Go to bed. Tomorrow you'll find her sleeping on a bed of vomit, like any girl her age. It's normal. Go to bed. I know my way out. May I? - Didn't you get my message? - I called you, but you were asleep. What happened to Mona? She said she'd come back. So? She might have changed her mind. I heard her screaming out my name. OK, don't get worked up. - And then... - And then? - There's the new neighbour. - What about him? If you'd seen the way he was looking at her. When I heard her screaming, I went out. And I saw him. - It's a coincidence. - No, he's strange. I did a search for his name on the Net. There's nothing. - So? - So? There's always something. A swimming competition, a site about friends he made at school. - There's always something. - Had you taken a sleeping pill? - Yes, but still... - I keep telling you, Clémence, too many sleeping pills can cause illusions. I tell you. I heard her. OK, OK. Listen, I'll be at work all day. Don't hesitate to call me. OK? OK. - Hello, Mr Benjamin. - Hello, Felicidade. Don't forget to clean my office, please. - Madame. - So, it's understood? You won't be as rude as you were with Mrs Dolivet. - I hate Mrs Dolivet. - Go. - Can't you see it's wet? - Yes, so? No, I won't play this. It's not possible. So what do you want to play, then? Yes, Mona, if you get this, call me, please. - How are you, Camille? - What's that? It's a flying lantern. It brings luck in Bangkok. That's enough. Get inside. You have homework to do. Shame. It's crashed. Think that brings bad luck? Why are you looking at that guy? Are you in love with him? He's better looking than your husband. Maybe, but my husband is much kinder. - Come on. - Kindness. Yeah. Do you think it's really useful? My grandmother always said, if someone strikes your cheek, punch them three times in the face. Not very Catholic, but effective, I'd have thought. Come on, play. - Well? How did it go? - Very well. Did you manage to get something out of this pig-headed boy? - I'm not pig-headed. - He plays very well. - Really? - What he likes, of course. Ah, there you go. As I said, he always does what he wants. Better than being a lackey. The problem is that he must always have the last word. Only when I'm right. It's not my fault I often am. - And insolent. - Perhaps, but very talented. Really? Teachers usually find him a real handful. - The two aren't incompatible. - Oh, no, no! I managed to see off two nurses in a week, but not to put up with my daughter! - How are you, darling Daddy? - Not well. Not well at all. You keep sending me all these white-shirted dragons! - What's that all about? - Dad, you heard the doctor. It was either that or a care home. - You'd rather go to a care home? - Want to send me to prison? Restore the death penalty while you're at it. - Grab a gun and get it over with! - You said that 20 years ago, - when Mum wanted us to buy a house. - You're like your mother. You always wanted to stifle me. I was dreaming of Marrakech, of Rabat, of Istanbul, of the Gobi desert, of the China sea. But we told you to go. You're the one who never wanted to. Even when you were little, everything was timed to perfection. A constant routine. School, the bath, the meal, the story. But you were great at it, especially telling the story. Yes, well, the story was more or less bearable. - And the good-night cuddle, too. - Vaguely. Vaguely. It was so long ago. I remember it perfectly. Ah, children are terrible. Look at what kind of world we're left with. We're not allowed to drink. We're not allowed to smoke. Coffee comes in capsules. A cup costs 14 francs. A bus ticket costs 10 francs. Nurses who won't allow you do to anything. And we keep asking for more. And we're here kissing you and loving you like fools. I'm off. I'll be back later, OK? Bye, dear. Mona? Mona? - Oh, I'm sorry. - What's wrong? - I didn't want to bother you. - Go to the waiting room. OK. Is anyone there? - Hello. - Hello. Maybe it was Mona calling you. She couldn't hear you and hung up. - It wasn't Mona. - How do you know? Benjamin, something's happened to her. I can feel it. Calm down, my darling. Excuse me, Felicidade. Did you hear anything last night, around two? - It's always noisy here. - Did you not hear a woman scream? - Perhaps. - So I'm not crazy. I wasn't dreaming. Are you prepared to tell the police? I'm not a grass. I don't talk to cops or priests. - That's my religion. - Even if someone's in danger? I was told to mind my own business. So I do. - Though there's not much of it. - One last question. The new neighbour. What's his name? Belkacemi, Mr Belkacemi. He's over there. - Do you know him? - Maybe. Can I go now? Are you though? I've got work to do. We lived at Paolo's, at 9 rue des Bleuets. We often went past it when I was little. Remember? - Yes? - May I speak to Paolo, please? There is no Paolo here. - Are you sure? - I've lived here 19 years. I think I'd know if a Paolo lived here too. There. Goodbye. What the hell do you think you're doing? Nice place. Nice and calm, isn't it? You're not very talkative. We do similar jobs, you and I. We know other people's secrets, clean up their mess, they call us when they need us and despise us. That creates a bond, no? Right. Nothing to report, is that it? Screams? - A succession of nurses? - It's none of my business. - I like you. - It's not reciprocal. - Tell me what Paolo said. - Mona lied to me. They don't live there. They never have. You think you know someone, but it turns out you know nothing. I know nothing about Mona and you know nothing about me, - even though I tell you everything. - We all have our secrets. And, in my experience, they're often best kept hidden. That way we keep our illusions without making things up. I observe people. I don't make things up. Felicidade seems cantankerous, but she's a lost soul. She pretends to be mean, but all she wants is passion. But maybe she has no secrets, no dreams, nothing. I don't want to think about it. It would be too sad. Come. Let's have lunch. - No smoking, sir. - She... she stole my cigar. Did you notice his latest nurse disappeared? - Perhaps he killed her. - Why not? It happens every day. Why shouldn't it happen here? You're not observing, Clémence, you're embellishing. And the ideal family there... As soon as Paule's back is turned her husband smokes and the girl wants to run away. So? We all try to break the rules. It's normal and it's a good thing. I think she's terribly bored and her parents don't notice it. That's half-baked psychology. And I dread to think about the new one. Stop it, Clémence. The neighbours aren't the problem. It's you. You and the stories you invent for them. I'm tired of it. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, but the messaging service is full. Please call later. Goodbye. - Hello. Captain Delépine, please. - Ask the man at the end. Thank you. - Hello. Captain Delépine, please. - That's his office. Thank you. Someone slipped this letter under my door. - This is empty. - I know. - So what do you think that means? - That someone wants to scare me. Tell me, why would a piece of paper frighten you? I don't know. But everything seems odd. Mona still hasn't returned. Judge Lefort's nurses keep vanishing. The concierge refuses to testify. And the new neighbour is always spying on me. OK, I'll be honest with you, because I like honesty. A 25-year-old girl who stays out all night... I know. She was out having fun. My husband keeps telling me that. Your husband's a sensible man. A young woman who stays out with her boyfriend... That's hardly a worrying development, you know. Especially if she's a prostitute. What? What are you talking about? Mona is an air hostess. She lives with her boyfriend and they're going to get married. That's what she told you? OK, if you don't want to listen to your husband, fine. But at least believe the word of a cop. Mona Beccaria is a call girl. We know her well. She works for herself and her stomping ground is the Vibration. - What's that? - A club on the way to Bordeaux. That's where she picks up her clients. So, please take your envelope and your unfounded fears, go home and try to do something normal. Something ordinary, like shopping, preparing a quiche lorraine. Adopt a poodle, take a lover, a mistress. That's none of my business. Play strip poker with Judge Lefort. - You can do something normal, no? - If Mona is a prostitute, does that make her a second-class citizen who can disappear without anyone caring? If she really has disappeared? I'm afraid so. Drive on, please. Where were you? I was worried sick. I wanted to see where Mona worked. Clémence, forget about Mona for a minute. I can't. If I do nothing, I'll go mad. - I must know what happened. - Nothing happened, except in your imagination. Clémence, a neighbour came to see me today. She said you were playing the piano last night, a dark piece, like a funeral march. So I looked... and I found this! I didn't say anything not to worry you. But I do worry, Clémence. I worry terribly. I'm on night duty, but I can't leave you in this state. Go. Listen, go. I'll look after myself. I promise. I know I'm not easy to live with right now. Please, Clémence, leave it to the police. I beg of you. - Come, let's have a coffee. - OK. Have an early night, OK? See you tomorrow morning. - Ah, it's you. Did you hear that? - Hear what? - Someone's up in the attic. - No, there isn't, Mrs Lacombe. The fuses have blown. I'll go change them. Clémence, sure you don't want a whisky? - No, thank you. - It might do you good. I'd rather we continued our conversation. I think we've said everything. I've no reason to doubt Mr Lefort, whom I've known for a long time. - And Felicidade? - She's confirmed it. So you don't remember anything? At my age, you don't have a very good memory. Unless the medication is responsible... or the alcohol. Might the blonde nurse with the glasses remember? No, I had to get rid of her. Please, make an effort. But I hear noises every day. But I imagine it's just people rolling around in the hay. - If you want my opinion. - When the lights went out I ran into the concierge on the stairs. Was she here? You're worse than my daughter! What do you want from me? It's like the new neighbour. What has he done to you? - What has he done to you? - Right, I think we're through. These are the nurse's glasses. Doesn't she need them to read? Have you come here to accuse me? I'll press charges for harassment! The nurse got sick of my temper. And if you don't want to bear the brunt of it, get out of here! - I think you've gone too far. - I feel I'm losing my mind. First, you tell us about the disappearance of a girl who is a prostitute. Then a car tries to run you over, but you're completely unscathed. An untraced anonymous phone call and an empty envelope. And then someone releases marbles down the stairs to scare you. - I know it sounds strange. - No, no. It's not strange at all. Mercifully, Paranoia can be cured. I'm sorry. Really sorry. - Ah, Mr Belkacemi? - Yes? Hello. Have you heard noise these past few days? - What kind of noise? - I don't know, like screams. Like a murder... I've just spent six months on a trawler, with incessant noise. I'd have thought the opposite. The silence of the sea. Are you joking? The sea is incredibly noisy. Here, it's so quiet I have to put the radio on to sleep. You should try drinking. For me, a few glasses work like a dream. Clémence! Clémence! - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you know this girl? It looks like Mona first thing in the morning. - She works here? - Why? Are you a cop? No, a friend, but I haven't seen her for two days, so I'm worried. If you're really a friend, you'll know Mona can vanish with a client without causing alarm. Even if she won't answer the phone? Go and talk to Paolo, over at the piano. They live together. Thank you. No, I haven't called Mona since we split up. - Didn't you call her that evening? - It wasn't me. It was someone else. Probably one of her clients. So it's true, she was a prostitute? She's a stripper. But she often ends up in bed with her clients. She kept saying she'd stop, but she carried on. - Why? - For the money. What else? In a night she can earn a month's salary. I thought she was an air hostess and you were an aeronautical engineer. I'm just a pianist. Sometimes their confidant, their make-up artist, their gofer. Try to understand her. It's hard to admit you're turning tricks in a nightclub. Her mother died when she was six and her aunt didn't look after her. So she was always at my house. She even lived with me before I met my husband. She said her father tried to abuse her. No, she never met him. He died in a car accident when she was a baby. Another lie. Anyway, she lied all the time. That's what my husband says. Maybe that's why she always hated him. I'm better. Don't worry. Meet Dr Lacombe, dearest. - He'll look after me now. - She must take it easy. I'll be back later. What an arsehole. You're not going to take his advice, are you? She hated him from the start. - She was very possessive. - She wasn't so exclusive with me. She slept with any rich guy who came to the bar. I tried to dissuade her. Hello, everyone. You OK, Mona? Oh, dear, girls. That's all rather feeble. Try not to fall. - Please, Mona, stop. - What? I want us to spend the day together, like a normal couple. Push a trolley together at the supermarket, have a TV dinner, brush our teeth, go to bed at the same time, wake up next to each other and eat toast with jam. - Is that too much to ask? - I've made plans. I can't say no. - Later, I promise. - I knew it. You'll never stop. In a few months I'll have enough savings for us to leave. You believe that? You believe in your own lies? I just want to put enough aside to feel safe. Get out of here. It's over. Go away. Get out. Get out! She was really upset when you broke up. - We had no future together. - Where did the postcards come from? Sometimes her clients took her along on their business trips. They were less likely to bump into their wives abroad. I'm sure something's happened to her. But nobody believes me and I'm starting to doubt myself. Her recent progress on the piano is down to you, I suppose. I'm worried about her, Paolo. You're not asleep? It's 6:00. And you're composing! No, I was waiting for you. I went to the place where Mona worked. It's a club on the road to Bordeaux. And Paolo is a pianist there. He told me everything. She was travelling around the world with her clients. Oh, but I told you so. That girl is a pervert. Paolo doesn't think it's normal she disappeared without warning. She'll find some excuse when she turns up again. I feel completely lost. Will you be able to cope while I'm away? - How long will you be gone? - It's a two-day conference. I'll be back as soon as possible. Do you think I'm relapsing? Yeah? I'd like my keys. That's not really our policy. - I've lost mine. - What if there's water damage - and I have to get in? - I don't want anyone getting in. - Not you, not anybody. - Fine. Thank you. Darling, I hope your conference is going well. I'm waiting for you. I miss you. - Oh, God, my darling. - Careful. I'm so sorry. What have I done? Come and sit down. Come, come. Sit down. Sit down. I wanted to surprise you. I was worried about you. It's bleeding too much, Clémence. Take me to the hospital. I'm so sorry, darling. Are you all right? - Has he been here long? - He got here an hour ago. - Is it serious? - No, he's not in danger. - Is his wife here? - She's with him. - It's back. It's back. - I'll help you. I promise. - I'm here for you. - I'm afraid. I fought so hard. - Good evening. - Good evening. I've better things to do than visit the ER. But the doctor spoke of a knife wound. I was told your name. That's why I came. Oh, sorry. Delépine, Arthur. Captain. - Benjamin Lacombe. My wife. - Oh, I know your wife. She called me several times to talk about attacks, and it turns out that the only real, tangible attack was yours. Tell me. Do you often want to kill your husband? I was frightened. I wanted to defend myself. - Did he attack you? - No. No. I thought... You thought your friend Mona had been killed. You thought your husband would kill you. - Want to know what I think? - That I'm mad? No. I'm sure you're mad. That's enough. My wife isn't responsible. Leave her alone. I looked into it before I came here. Your wife was institutionalised. I just want to know whether she's still dangerous. You're quite wrong. Clémence is only a danger to herself. Said the husband who's just been stabbed in the back. Would you mind following me? I don't like hospital rooms. You don't have to go with him. You can wait for a lawyer. I'll come with you. Don't worry. So, why were you put in a mental home? The bloody doctors wouldn't tell me. - I don't have to tell you either. - No, but I'd advise you to. I'm a relentless man, as all my colleagues would attest. They generally add that I'm a complete bastard. I was institutionalised because... I believed erroneous things. Even though my life was going perfectly well. I was a famous pianist. I composed my own music. I lived with another musician. Everything was going fine. Until the day I lost the baby I was carrying. I was on tour. I dropped everything and went back to Angoulême. Mona moved in. She looked after me both cheerfully and attentively. But I was still depressed and I started to imagine things. That everyone had it in for you? Yes. - What's wrong? - Did you make the tea? - What did you put in it? - Nothing. Yes, for a few months, I thought people were out to kill me. Even those closest to me. Forgive me. - And then? - I was institutionalised. Sleep therapy, electroshocks. That's when I met my husband. He saved me. Is that why he fusses over you? Yes. And he won't let me compose. He says creativity can drive frail people mad. - You're frail? - I think so, yes. What's your relationship with your husband like? Very good. And Mona's with him? - They avoided each other. - So she's his mistress. No, she's not. You're wrong. Where was he the night she disappeared? He was on night duty at the hospital in Cognac. Yes, that'll be all. I'll take you home. - Good night. - Good night. It's outrageous! Nobody's forcing you to listen. But I live right across from her, Felicidade, right across. You've got to be crazy to play the piano at four in the morning. Hello, Mrs Secrétan. Hello. Oh, Camille won't come for her lesson today. She's ill. What's wrong? Have you been crying? - Don't be absurd. - I thought one shouldn't lie. - You're right. I cried. - Why? - Because of a friend. - Want an ice-cream? OK. So long as I pay. It's like with Little Red Riding Hood. I'm afraid my friend Mona has been eaten by a wolf. What will you do to the wolf? Kill it? No, I'll open its stomach to see if Mona's inside. Thank you. That's very brave. - You must be very scared. - Very. Come. Let's hurry or you'll be late. Well? Where were you? I thought something had happened to you! - We went for an ice-cream. - You're totally irresponsible! Come. You're never coming back here! - It's me. - Hello, darling? What's wrong? - You OK? - No. Yes. Nothing. - Don't worry. - I'll call you back. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought... Will you be long? Your husband pays me 20 Euros a week to clean. But if it bothers you, I'll take the money and go to the cinema. No, take your time. All right. Clémence, please forgive me for last time. People get cranky as they get old. We lose out tempers easily, but then we regret it. It's my fault. Really. Please don't worry about it. What would this place be like without you, Clémence? A shed without music and without soul. Thank you. Tonight I'm getting a new nurse. But don't tell anyone. - Where did the redhead go? - To the devil. What the hell are you doing here? I wanted to know if I've gone mad. Since my friend disappeared... - What friend? - The one at my house the other day. - What does that have to do with me? - The way you were staring at her, - I thought... - What? I'm sorry. I can't make people disappear by staring at them. - What? You're disappointed? - No, I'm really sorry. The knife? It's a fisherman's knife. I always have with me. I work on a trawler six months a year. I saw you outside, just after I heard my friend scream. Perhaps it was a nightmare? I was all alone. I just saw a car leaving. - What kind of car? - A Renault. Like ours? That's impossible. My husband was on night duty. Is that the only Renault in the neighbourhood? I'd better go. Yes, it would be best. Mrs Lacombe? Your husband will be down in five minutes. Thank you. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just so ashamed of what I've done. It's not important. I'm just worried about you. Here, take this. It's very serious, Clémence. Take this to avoid a relapse. There. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I'm off. Bye. What's going on? Clémence! Clémence! - What are you doing? - You tossed and turned all night. I have to go to the police station. The captain asked me to go round. - What does he want? - To close the file. I must sign a declaration to exonerate you. Hello, Léo. What do you want? My aunt doesn't want me here, so I've come secretly. I won't give in. If I start obeying now, what will it be like when I'm an adult? I might become a real lemming. OK. What's wrong? I need your help, Léo. Will you help? Let's forget about the lesson. You need another teacher. - I'm not talented enough. - They told me I was rubbish. Never let anyone tell you such things, OK? - Come along. - What are we doing? Come with me. Remember I told you about the wolf who ate Mona? - You opened its stomach? - I may have got the wrong wolf. Why are you going through his clothes? Is your husband the wolf? I don't know. Come. Now, listen up. Don't move. If you hear any noise, come and get me and then hide. OK? - And you? - Don't worry about me. Just don't leave your hiding place. OK? Have you ever seen a wolf eat a hunter? Come, go and hide. Oh, no! Oh, no! - Someone's coming! - Go and hide. Go hide! That's Mona's key ring. What did you do to her? Did you kill her? It's her fault. She asked for it. That evening, I was able to leave earlier. When I got back, I ran into her. Good evening, Mona, we must talk. She didn't seem very happy to see me, but she didn't say anything. She followed me, without a word. We hadn't seen you for a while. - I come when I can. - Between two clients? You're in no position to lecture me. Get out! She was always haughty, disdainful. I hate you! You made Clémence fearful, quiet, unhappy! Shut up, you little bitch! I haven't told Clémence anything, not to upset her. But you've gone too far. I'll tell her what a shit you are. You won't say a word! I'll tell her you tried to rape me when I was 15, - and how you threatened me. - And I'll say you're a liar. A lying slut. And when she finds out what you really do, who will she believe? You or me? Clémence! Clémence! It was an accident, you see. - You raped Mona? - She's the one who turned me on. She was already a whore. It came naturally to her. She was still a little girl. So the letter, the blown fuses, the car, it was you? You left me no choice. You kept nosing about. You wanted to make me seem crazy? That was easy. I know you so well. - And now? - Now? Now we must end it. You always wanted to find out other people's secrets, but it's sometimes best not to know. - What's that? - Oh, no! Léo! - Léo? - No, not Léo! You all right? What's happened? Get out of the way. I must take my wife to A&E. - You won't take her anywhere. - Don't interfere! What's going on, for heaven's sake? Call the police! This man is mad! He attacked Clémence! OK. I already called the police. They're on their way. What's going on? Police! Stop that immediately! This man attacked my wife. You must help me, sir. He's been harassing my wife since he got here. - Did you see anything? - Tell him what you saw! - This man attacked me. - I didn't see a thing. You OK, Mrs Lacombe? You don't seem well. Come along. Come here, kid. Don't be afraid. I just ran into a terrified little boy. And he told me a completely different story. And I like listening to what kids have to say. Come with me, Mr Lacombe. - Thank you. - Come along. Follow me. Will you be all right? - Good evening. - Good evening. You all right? We both loved her.

Thank you. - Here you are. - Thank you. Thank you, Léo. I don't know what would have happened without you. You'd have died, clearly. My aunt has agreed for me to go to the Conservatoire. - You'll do really well. - Yes, I know. Don't worry. Even when I'm a great pianist, I'll come see you. And you'll give me lessons. Come back soon. And send postcards. I promise. - Goodbye, Clémence. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Clémence. - Goodbye, sweetie. Mrs Clémence, what shall I do with your post while you're away? - Hold onto it. - Have a nice holiday. Yes, have a nice holiday. We'll miss you. I think you'll manage fine. I know why you got rid of all your nurses. They were all dragons. She's a pearl. Yes, she lets me do what I want. - You OK? - Yes. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
