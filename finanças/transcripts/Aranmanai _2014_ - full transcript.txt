Ayyanar? The whole town is off to see the holy man. Aren't you coming? I was told the owners of the palace are visiting for a few days. They said they'd sell it to me. It has been shut for 5 years, right? That's why I'm going to clean up the place. What about the girl who ran away? - They've traced her. They said they'd be here within 2-3 days. Take the blessings of the holy man on my behalf as well. - Okay. Start the car. Which palace? What is the deal? You're new to the town so you don't know. At the far end of our town, there is a palace that belongs to the old landlord. Acres and acres of land.. Worth millions. Ayyanar is the caretaker for now. He has been a caretaker for so many years. He intends buying it now. But the problem is, the landlord has 3 heirs. Two sons and a daughter. The daughter eloped with a servant. Only if she signs the contract, the palace can be sold. They were searching for her all these years. They must have finally found her. See how smart Ayyanar is! Even before buying the palace he struck a deal with a foreign company. He'll make a fortune soon. Wait here. I'll go and take a look. Go that side. - Hurry up. Are the preparations going fine for the festival of our goddess? Yes, very well. Our goddess is going to be taken on a procession this Friday. You are travelling through our town and we feel sad that you are not stopping by. You know how important project Mukkoodal is! No, Sage, it's just.. I'll definitely come when the time is right. Sir! What is it? It's a termite hill, right in the center of the house. Maybe because it was locked up for 5 years. Maybe this place is.. Don't let your imagination run wild! Go and do your work. Sage, a request. You're not stopping by but do bless our land with your holy tread, please! What is this? He must have struck the snake inside the hill. That blood must have spurted out. Boss, I need a hand. - Let's go help. I will be coming to your town very soon. Sage? Until then, you must all be careful. Chef, check your list. Driver, are you kidding? My aunt isn't feeling well. She might pass away any day. I want to visit my hometown. Just another 2 or 3 days. Then the owners of the palace will be here. - I know. You'll say so and go on leave for 10 days. She raised me. If I'm not by her side, when she breathes her last what will my family think of me? I'll just run away without informing you. Then you just have to find another cook. Keep grumbling like this. It's time to drink. Make 2 omelets for me. What a drunkard! I wonder why he was hired! I thought I saw someone standing over there. Why a power failure at this hour? Who is it? Who is it? Who is there? Tell me, who's there? Who's there? Why are you crying? W-Who? Oh no! Ghost! Who is closing the door? Open it. Open the door. Oh God! Save me! Someone, please save me. You drunkard! Come and save me. Come here and open the door. What are you doing? Look behind you! Ghost! Easwari? Easwari! Eas.. Move. Brother, I'm here. - Easwari, come. Good day. How do you do? This is my son. - Greetings. What happened to your loin cloth? It slipped off in the crowd. Give that to me. My husband's loin cloth is inside, find it and wear it. He's blissfully unaware that he has lost his loin cloth! How did you live with him for all these years? Look here, I'm not your servant that you'd talk to me like this. I'm the son-in-law of this palace. Treat me with respect or I'll leave right now. - No. Don't get angry. I'm so glad you came. Really? - Oh yes! That's my brother-in-law! 'No matter where you go, I'll hunt you down and kill you.' 'Hey! Don't come looking for me' 'If I ever see you I'll kill you.' Welcome! My sister's engagement is going to be held this Sunday. You must attend it without fail. We will, for sure. Who is this 'kulfi' ice cream? What are you looking at? She's my daughter. She has just come back after finishing her studies. Don't embarrass us here. Shut up. - Be quiet. My son is finally doing something worthwhile. If he somehow charms her my brother's share will completely be ours. He has only one daughter. Don't worry, I'll get her. Hasn't the older heir's son arrived from Mumbai? He's newly married. He's taking his sweet time showing his wife all the places on the way. Romance on the road! "Knife-edged glance! Your eyes are as sharp as a needle." "Don't pierce my heart!" "Back to your home town, love." "Don't pinch or tease me now." "Oh yeah, whatever you say is right!" "Thank you.. Thank you, my love!" "Thank you.. Thank you, my love!" "My girl!" "As far as the eyes can see blissful with a capital B.." "As far as the eyes can see blissful with a capital B.." "River with anklets adorned ripples its way singing a song." "Even without the air conditioner the margosa tree's breeze is cool." "Even if no pizza or burger steamed 'puttu' is a tasty appetizer." "Our minds can fly fancy-free beyond barriers beautifully." "Oh yeah, whatever you say is right!" "Thank you.. Thank you, my love!" "Thank you.. Thank you, my love!" "When wind huffing and puffing blows floral fragrance faithfully follows." "Yellow myna on seeing me nods its head from the hedge gaily." "Grandparents' bedtime stories are stored in our hearts as memories." "Even if we leave our native land our soul belongs to this sand." "Let 100 years pass by." "Visiting our place of birth where there is, 24x7 Heaven on Earth." "Oh yeah, whatever you say is right!" "Thank you.. Thank you, my love!" "Thank you.. Thank you, my love!" Wow! - How do you like the palace? - Fantastic! Didn't I tell you that you'd be amazed? You haven't met my relatives as yet. Wait and watch! Welcome, dear. Welcome. - How are you, uncle? - Are you done with your sight-seeing? Come, Murali. - Come. Welcome! Do you remember me? Aunt Easwari! - The one who eloped when she was young! We've come back now. Why bring it up? Come inside. - Step in. Thanks a lot, Murali. You came as soon as I called to solve my financial crisis. Your father would have never let us sell this place. This place has been locked up and not used by anyone, uncle. At least it would come handy in solving your problems. Why didn't you come yesterday? Did you eat? Shall I get you something to eat? Okay, I'll listen to all that you say. My mother will scold me. Who are you talking to, baby? Going now? - She's my daughter. She's slightly retarded. Will you come back at night? Bring me something. Hey, Maya! - Hi! Did you look around our town? How is it? - It's superb! And this palace is extraordinary. Grandma suffers from breathing trouble. Why don't you dial 108 for an ambulance? When I do, they tell me not to call a million times and harass them. They say, they feel like they are making school trips. Only the ambulance's tires are wearing out. Grandma isn't dying. Just dump her under a tree near the hospital premises. When she's about to die, she can go straight to the mortuary. Grandma! Hello, Paalsamy! You're already here! I thought I'd send for you once she becomes a corpse. But you've come ahead of time. Who cares if your grandma is alive or dead? We need interest. If we don't pay up you'll even take our briefs away. You've taken up loans from the entire town, Paalsamy. I feel so bad, seeing you humiliated. What else do I do? I have no choice as I was born into a family of beggars. You belong to a landlord's family, Paalsamy. Here is the proof. The man standing next to me in the photo is your grandpa. He wasn't an ordinary man. Was he the grandpa like actor Kamal in 'Indian'? No, he's the landlord of Poovapatti What? Landlord? - Yes. Even a counselor's wife walks around, decked in jewelry. You claim to be a landlord's wife! And you don't even possess a good blanket. I wasn't his wife. - Then? I was his mistress. This photo isn't your only secret. You've hidden the landlord himself. Why are you telling me about your affair now? He liked me when I was young and secretly got married to me. That is when we clicked this picture. The other copy is in his palace. Why are you sharing these flashbacks now? I kept quiet because I didn't want to ruin his reputation. But now they're planning to sell the palace, my boy. If you show them this photo and prove you're also an heir then you'll get a share of the profit as a grandson. It's worth millions. Millions? What are you saying? Is this really the landlord of Poovapatti? He looks as dark as night. Let me see him in the light. Landlord grandpa! Grandpa Oh no! Grandpa's gone. Grandma is dead too. Grandma! Unfortunately, I destroyed the proof you gave me. How will I prove I'm the heir, grandma? All your hard work has gone to waste! Don't worry, Paalsamy. Your grandma said there was another copy at the palace. Prove your lineage with that. Only then will your grandma's soul rest in peace. You're egging me on to get your loan repaid! Even if not for you I'll ask for justice for my grandma. Grandma, before the 16th day of the funeral if I don't get my share, then I'm not all I claim to be! Is that possible? This Paalsamy is a bad boy, sir. It's 11:00 p.m. and this imbecile is missing. Let him come, I shall give him a piece of my mind. Oh, God! Madhavi? Madhavi? - Yes. It's 11:00 p.m. Aren't you going to bed? One minute, I'll send this mail and come. Okay. Come fast. Shameless man! Roams around town all night and then comes late to bed. Why do you look so strange, Easwari? When did you go to the bathroom? My stomach has been somersaulting real bad. For the last half hour I've been in the bathroom. Half an hour? Then? What.. What happened? I felt as if someone was lying down next to me. Who else will dare to do that other than me? You froze out of fear! Go to bed. Hurry up. Who are you? What do you want? Even if you get a 10% share you'll be a millionaire, boss. Why are you suddenly calling me 'boss'? - Of course. If you want you can lend us money! Boss! - 'Boss' sounds nice. There's something mumbo jumbo about this place. What? They always throw away things that are obsolete. My grandma was obsolete but wasn't useless. She wasn't an ordinary lady. She was the mistress, boss. Why do you look like an owl with a heart attack? Look there, boss. Oh my! She looks like a boiled egg peeled, shining bright and white. Who is she? Who cares who she is? Poor thing, she's sweating! With my loin cloth, shall I offer to wipe her beads of sweat? You think, she'd die of a heart attack because of the odor? Boss, she has a tiny mole on her hip. If I ask you to teach the kids at home you cook up excuses of short-sightedness. We are 500 feet away and you spot the tiniest mole accurately. Who is he? He's springing up like a mushroom. Must be a thief, boss. He has probably come to steal. What the heck? How dare he?! It's my grandma's labor of love! I will get him and.. - He's picking up a stone, boss! Who is it? He seems to be faster than me. - Boss.. He's playing with pebbles. Is she a pond to throw pebbles at? Give me a stick. I'll hit that mushroom head. Follow me. Where did he go? He must be right under. - Hey! Come out! Look for him. Hey! Stop! Who are you? We came to click pictures. Photo? You creeps! Wait till I catch you! - Run! Run! - Rascals, wait! This is the dead end. Boiled egg! - Listen to me. You.. - Let me jump over this side. Wait for me. I'm coming. Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! - If you hold someone like this he won't try to escape even if he's really a thief. Come! - Thief, yes! I'm a thief. I won't let you go. You're trapped. Don't let me go. Please don't. Excuse me, we are the main thieves. We'll be the witness. - No! I'm the boss. Hold me tight. - So, you're the main culprits! You're dead meat. Thief! -Don't let me go. Hold me real tight. Like you held him. 'Their shoulders are sagging like pillow covers.' 'And they're falling all over her.' There you go. - What happened? Who are they? They came to steal and got caught. Do we look like thieves? I wanted to know if I could be a cook here, master. Master? - Yes. - That's me. Shut up! - Only you should have come for the job. Why bring these two accompaniments along? I make the gravy. They add the onions and garlic into it. How will they assist? By flinging stones at me! - No. That wasn't us. There was a head like a mushroom here. You've got the job. Why rake up all that? Who are these people? They are the new cooks I have recruited. We'll be here for only a few days. As soon as we register the property in Ayyanar's name we'll go our ways. Why do we need a new cook? My brother-in-law has hired you. Start your work in the kitchen. Okay, the man in safari suit. I need to test your culinary skills. Cook something for me. What do you want? Chicken curry, fish fry minced mutton, minced egg. Crab soup, turkey roast and prawn masala. This is the menu for lunch now. I'll think about what you have to cook tonight. Let's go in, dear. Now do you realize, why they are selling the palace? Before they finish eating let us find the picture and rake in our share. Wait, sister! I won't let you go. Who are you chasing? - My elder sister. Poor kiddo! Why don't you get her treated? We've tried everything, sir. Nothing has worked. How much can I spend? Come, try to catch me. You can't. Run! Is he hurt badly? How is he now? Doctor is attending to him now. Why are you scrutinizing me like the fuel gauge in a gas station? You smart ass! What are you doing here? The old cook left all of a sudden. He came asking for a job as a cook. We decided to employ him, as it's for a few days. He's reformed now. Ms. Easwari.. Why are you standing all around me? Master, what happened to me? That's what we want to know. You're addressing me as if you work for me. What happened to you? Ms. Easwari, I'm seeing you in a sari for the very first time. You look as beautiful as Goddess Mahalakshmi! He calls her beautiful when she looks like a frizzy haired Chinese film villain. He has forgotten recent events because of the hard knock. - No. Looks like he has a total memory loss. He has gone 25 years behind. He'll get better eventually. You don't need to spend on medication. He'll recover on his own slowly. Ms. Easwari! I'm completely alright. Go and take rest. I'll get back to work. I'm your wife. We are married. You may like me but don't raise your voice like this. If your brother hears this, our love affair will leak, right? He has just now fallen in love, boss. Looks like he'll become a father in 2040. People usually forget the past if they bang their heads. This man has forgotten the present too! They say drumstick is an aphrodisiac. Here, the drumstick itself is in a romantic mood! We can get the registration done tomorrow. I'll pay you soon. Don't we know about you? If you give me the parent document I can do all the ground work. Maya, give me the documents. Oh, God! Why is Maya screaming? Maya, what happened? Why did you scream? What just happened? - How did this happen? I don't know. The wardrobe was filled with water. The pipeline is broken on top. That's how it must have leaked. Oh no! The papers are now wet and ruined. What do we do now? It might take a few weeks to organize the new set of documents. If you want, you can go home. We'll get it ready by then. We can't keep travelling back and forth. Son, I know a lot of people in the registrar's office. If I go there in person, I can get it done in 2 days. It makes sense to finish the work and go. That's right. Let's go. Do you have to go? Yes, if we finish it quickly, we can go home soon. Why? I'm a little terrified by the things happening here. Are you scared? - Please stay with me. There are so many people here. I'll be back in just 2 days. Until then, don't confuse yourself by letting your imagination run. Relax! Okay? I had to go to Tirunelveli, urgently. So, I wasn't able to invite everyone. But you must attend my sister's engagement. We'll come for sure with the whole family. - Thanks. You attend to the paperwork. - Shall we leave? Let's go. Come, onion and garlic. Did you check out all the stuff in every nook and corner here? Boss, Maya lives in the second room on the left of the first floor. Madhavi in the first room and Easwari is in the room towards the right. What about the maid? - She sleeps in the courtyard. I asked for the picture and you come up with the locations where women sleep! My future life lies in my grandma's history. It's the only proof of my lineage. We must find it somehow. Why are you jabbering continuously? Go to bed. Looks like your face has lost a few kilos. I've trimmed my moustache, no? So why are you lying outside here with us? Moron! I'm not your employer. I'm just another employee like you. - Hey! After his head injury, you know he's half a lunatic. Is that why he trimmed his moustache to look young? You call him young? You junk head.. Hey! Go to sleep. "Here is milk and fruits.. Oh, my beloved.." Easwari, I am back. Usually people go bonkers after they fall in love. His case seems topsy-turvy! Let's get to work. - Okay, boss. Easwari? Easu.. Easu.. - What is it? I have got you flavored milk, your favorite drink. This is called 'midnight masala'. One who suffers from jaundice sees the world yellow. To a lunatic, everything seems like a loony bin! I don't want any milk. Go back to bed. Easwari! - What is it? If you don't drink this milk, I'll slit my own throat. I'll drink that darn milk. Drink it up fast. Baby corn soup is also waiting! What happened? - It has no sugar. Give it to me. It seems sweet enough. Idiot! My lips touched it, right? That's why it tastes sweet to you. Add some sugar to it. I'll drink it. If I get caught up with this nutcase I'll have a sleepless tonight! Escape! - Here! Boss? Master! Forgive us. I'm not a thief anymore. I've reformed, master. Master? The landlord must have gone astray. I'm also a product of his labor of love! I swear, master. This is the whole truth. Trust me. Why are you punishing yourself for my grandpa's evil deeds? Even employees own side businesses. What is wrong about it if my grandma was his mistress? Boss, one minute. He's turning him around like a remote controlled car. He seems to be sleepwalking, boss. How sad? This is a lucky disease. Sleepwalkers won't get diabetes at all, boss. Really? - Yes. Those who walk for 2 kilometers never suffer from high blood sugar. How will someone who walks all night ever suffer from diabetes? If I punch you, your nose will bleed. Go, look for the picture. At this hour, whom are you playing 'hide and seek' with? With my husband of course. He's all lovey-dovey at odd times. I can't even go to the bathroom. He drew my face with a chalk on the bathroom wall wrote 'I love you' and ran away. That ugly face like a slit open watermelon was yours, isn't it? Dad? Dad! - How come you are awake at this hour? I was searching for my dad. - We have so much in common. You're searching for your dad. I'm searching for my mom. My son is wooing her with such classical poetry. For the first time, I'm seeing a mother gloating over her son's flirting skills. Dad? - Maya, one minute. Instead of looking for our parents shall we talk about when we should become parents? - Idiot! That slap will make your son get epileptic fits! And you're laughing like a maniac here. He takes after his dad in getting slapped. - Be careful! Uncle, warn him. He's behaving badly. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Who are you, my boy? Are you related to the landlord? Get lost! He's asking his own son if he's related to him. Your husband has lost it. Easu? He's hounding me like a sniffer dog now. Let me scoot. - Why push me? This sapped Sapota must have been the landlord's stooge. If I tap him on the right spot I'll get all the details on the dot. You seem to be drooling all over Easwari of late. Between Easwari and me.. Is there a canal flowing? No love.. What if master gets to know? - No. He'll kill me if he gets to know. Shall I tell him? - Please don't! If you don't want this affair to be leaked you must open up about what I want to know. - What? Where did the old landlord keep his most important stuff? In a box under the neck of the wild buffalo upstairs. That buffalo has given custody of his secrets to his own breed! I'll go right now. - Wait! What? - Suggest me an idea, as to how to make Easwari my mine. Rape her and they will get her married to you! Will that work? - You may find it difficult. I don't mean rape, I mean the wedding. If this can work, all that will automatically follow. There are so many photos here as if it's a studio. He has kept so many items in this box just like your grandma. Does that give you the right to call my grandma a tart? Buffalo! Shut up and search. Boss, I found it. Let me see. This doesn't look like my grandmother. She is my grandma, not yours. Was your grandma a mistress too? That's how it seems. So do we both share the same grandpa? Get lost, you moron. Grandpa it seems! He's collected quite a harem. If we dig too deep, the whole town will stake a claim. Then if we split the palace we won't even get a brick! Will all our labor go to waste, boss? It was our grandmothers' labor of love, squared! Forgive me, Easwari. Only if I rape you, will I be able to wipe out your brother's arrogance. 'What is he looking at? That doll is turning him on.' I rolled a four. It's your turn now. Dear.. Who are you playing with? - My sister of course. Sister? I can't see anyone. You mad fellow! She's right in front of me. You're mad, and you calling me mad! Ask your invisible sister to roll a dice now. Sister, please play! Why is he running like he has been operated with a rusted blade? What happened? What was that scream? - Sir.. Master, it's our boy. He'll be petrified even by a small hole. He saw this palace and got scared out of his wits. Why are you standing around in your underwear? How do I.. Easwari.. What happened? How do I explain this? Forgive me, master. - Yes. I desire to get married to your sister. Therefore, I tried to rape her so that nothing can stop us. Nothing happened. Hey! - He's my husband now. - He's not your husband. He's a servant in this house. Now I know how he lured you. I didn't get a chance to do this, 25 years ago. Now I've got it. Rukku? - What? All kinds of strange incidents are happening in this house. - So? Don't sleep alone. I'll keep your company. Find someone else, you drunkard! - Go. I'll get you someday. Oh, you! What? Sister has called for you. Sister? Or mother? Sister. - Mad girl! She has got her mother and sister mixed up. As long as my job gets done, it's fine! Rukku? Rukku! Where did she go after calling me over? She's faster than me. You took a shower and got ready! Rukku, do you think I can't find you if you hide? I'll come and get you. Who is it? Who is there? Swamy? Swamy! Where are you? Raj, where's the driver? I'm also looking for him. He's nowhere to be seen. I told Ayyanar not to hire drunkards. Who knows where he has passed out? The procession will start by the time he comes. You all leave. - Aren't you coming? No, dear, I got some work in town. I'll finish it and then join you. I've informed the temple trustee. He will take good care of you. What is so special today, sir? - This.. Friday, on the new moon day the solar eclipse starts early in the morning. It's a very bad omen. Even if it's 150 years old the malefic effects will affect even our goddess! So, to negate the bad effect all the villages join to take a procession of the 8 goddesses on the day of solar eclipse and cleanse all the idols in the river. As a result, the malefic effect is erased. It is a traditional belief. Today our village goddess shall go. Salutations to You! O Narayani.. Who is complete with all auspicious attributes.. Giver of refuge with 3 eyes and a shining face, salutations! Hi! Aunt? - What is it? A chap over there is throwing flowers at me. Who? Is it the sixth palanquin bearer? How did you guess so correctly? He targeted me even before you. - What? Threw a flower at you! Why? What do I lack? Maybe you're just a few inches taller. Aunt, he has picked up another flower. Look at my man's skill! You should attend the festival, carry the palanquin and leave without making any trouble. You shouldn't throw flowers on girls and play with them. Who are you to tell me? Shall we leave? - Yes, let's go. Her boyfriend. - Does the girl know that? I have just started flirting with her. It'll take some time to fall into bed. Brother said he'd bring the jeep here, I can't find him. This chap? - Where is he? Aunt, look behind. Just some extra flab of cholesterol! - Aunt! Look behind! Why does he keep hounding us? Let's get out of here fast. If a fair and adorable woman, who looks like a bunny rabbit walks men are bound to get smitten. That's not his fault. It's my fault. I was born beautiful. Don't you think this is slightly over the top? - What? I don't understand a word. - What can I really say? Look behind. He's following only me. Come fast. He's taking a picture on his cell phone. He seems to be getting turned on, looking at our backs. Cover yourselves up. He's following us whichever alley we go to! Look there! My Lord! My sweetheart! Eas.. - How could you throw flowers at us? Now look! I'll throw flowers back at you. He's staring. If you're really brave, fling it back at me now. - Easu.. Stop calling me 'Easu'. Throw your stick in such a way that his ribs fall apart. - You're rattling without realizing that I'm not holding this stick to fight. But to support myself. I was this brave lion and he made me lean like this. He'll aim a single flower at the hip, like bull's eye! Imagine what he'll do with a string of them now! Aunt, we're in a safe place. Even if my spouse is weak co-travelers are in no way meek. Our time is good. Mister, slap him real hard. Come on, attack! Take off your jewelry and give them to me. Be brave, aunt. Nothing will happen to us. Not only our jewelry they can't even touch the tip of our nails! - Do you know martial arts? - Just wait and watch! What happened just now? - What were you looking at? When there's a fight, you must pay attention. Focus on every single movement of the body. Give her the stick - And then? First, give it to her. - Yes. One punch on his face. Twist his hand. You should have seen how he grabbed his neck and spun him around in circles and threw him in mid-air. Instead of thinking how how to attack others we must now plan how to defend ourselves. Let's rush from here. What happened? You already got into a fight, son-in-law! No, it's not that.. - Is he your son-in-law? He's Madhavi's brother. Brother? Yes, he's a lawyer at the High Court. You don't know him because you didn't attend my wedding. I'd have told you earlier. But I thought this would be more fun. I'll urinate, and that's fun to you! - Oh no! Grandma! All your hard work has gone waste. I thought I'd get settled for a life with my legacy. But like a mongrel let loose, my landlord-grandpa has had multiple flings to last him a lifetime. I better stick to loans and spend my days without dreams. - Boss! Boss! Chicken curry is ready! If we make the soup we're all set for lunch. He is really living the role of a cook instead of faking it. Why are you dull, boss? - I need to powder my face. You camphor nosed fella! No picture, no share, the chap who came with me is missing. Are you bothered about any of this? So what if you don't find a proof? You'll definitely get a share in the property. But you must listen to all that I say. Only today, I have heard wise words from your dented mouth. Boss, you know that the head turning, heart breaking, glam doll Maya? If you woo her and trap her, you'll get a share for sure. Why do you confuse conjugal rights with the 64 poses in 'Kamasutra'? Take your leg off me! Sorry, boss. I went a little overboard. How's my idea? Sounds like a good plan. But I'm like some leftover rice. She's a burger. Can the two mix? An elephant will never knows its own strength, boss. Does a cat know it then? Not that. Look at her complexion, height and personality. You are the only perfect match for her. It will work out, boss. Take care. - Thank you. A match made in heaven. I am the right match for her complexion, height weight and personality. I didn't mean you. Look there. Who is he? Looks like Undertaker's brother. Paalsamy, I'm tired. Get me some coffee. Come in. Are you the cook? Is there anything to eat? There's 'Khushboo Idly', soft and spongy, want some? Who are you? A relative? No exclusive! Why are you standing here? Come inside, son-in-law. Sir, is he your son-in-law? We know the boy well. He's Madhavi's brother. I thought he was engaged to Maya. That's a good thought. If their chemistry works out, maybe we can fix them up. Paalsamy, you and your wretched tongue! You're egging on my reticent brother. Why are you talking so loudly like a bike with a faulty silencer? I wanted to get my son married to my brother's daughter. You poured acid on my aspirations! How will I fulfill my dream? He'll dish up tomato rice and you can fulfill your wish-list. Go. Boss, competition is heating up now. One is a six footer and the other one is a short guy. What will you do? No matter who's here to get her, that chick is mine. Paalsamy is a bad boy! Ravi, you've come all the way from Chennai, for the case in Madurai. Is that case so important? It's an important client's case and they adjourned it for next month. Meanwhile, you called and here I am. Massive palace! Looks magnificent. Scary too! I have no clue what's wrong here. Do you believe in spirits? As in liquor! I knew you would ridicule me! I meant ghost. Maya has also felt its presence. She's used to living in a small space with 100 flats bunched together. This is one sprawling palace that measure's up to 100 acres. That too, it's so quiet. The smallest sound will be terrifying. Madhavi, what's wrong? I don't mind if anything happens to me. But I don't want my husband to get hurt. Don't trouble yourself with such negative thoughts. Ravi, do you remember the two wheeler accident during my engagement? - Yes. I never told you this. All the doctors we consulted told I could never conceive. He knew it and still married me. I've consulted all the best doctors to conceive a baby for him. Even before coming here I went through some tests. I'm tense as I want the results to be positive. But the ambience here is scary. The worse thing is, as the registration has got delayed, and we can't leave. He thinks my fears are baseless. How can an educated girl like you be so silly? Till you leave, I'll be here with you and prove your fears are false. I'm here for you. Stop worrying. What, dear? Behind you.. I can't see anything. I saw it. You're really upset. Go and take rest. Listen to me, dear. Cops?! Did a man come here claiming to be a lawyer? Yes, why do you ask? He's not a lawyer. He's an accused. He hit 5-6 men and they've been hospitalized. The tall guy is now out of the game. Then what about the short guy? I don't even consider him my competition. He isn't that kind of a man. That's for us to decide. Call him. We must take him to the station to interrogate. Station! He's not at home. Inspector.. One minute. Instead of coming with a team to nab a professional accused you've come alone, as if you are taking your due from a street vendor. But don't worry. The man you want is inside. I'll help you. Come on. Mr. Lawyer.. Mr. Lawyer? Ms. Maya sprained her back. She wants to see you immediately. Look how he's on his toes to massage her hip! Come, sir. Please come. Did you get caught? Inspector, whether you hang him upside down and dunk him into water or thrash him on the floor. Do show me a demo first, sir. Why does he hate you so much? - What? Now he's giving a bear-hug! He's my friend. Is this how you joke? I was so scared. What brings you here? It's been 2 months since I got transferred. You were getting into the jeep at the temple festival. What are you standing here for? Go and bring some tea. Keep an eye on your cook. He's bent on sending you to inferno! Shift the other eye on that girl. She defends you to the ends of the earth. What's up? - Stop building castles! Paalsamy, I wonder what you have against me. If someone bills the shirt I wanted to buy, how will I feel? I didn't quite get you. - I'm not the cook here as you think. In a way, this palace belongs to me. Only if I woo Maya I can repay my loans. Why don't you do it? How can you say it so easily? If she's a local model, I can lure her with Indian sweets. She's ultra-modern. I don't even know how to inch my way up to her. Every girl in this world has a weaker side. Find that out and you can charm her! You're a lawyer. You know it all. I'm not you, right? Tip me off with a point. That's all? Come with me. That's weak. As per the proven formula, all women are frightened of cockroaches. Maya is in the shower. Throw it in and she will come out screaming. You'll be standing out. She'll bump into you and it will automatically work. Super idea! But you won't gloat to anyone that it was your idea, right? Of course not. What are you doing? Taking safety measures before we are in each other's arms and rolling. I'm adjusting the cot. She'll come out anytime. Go and throw it fast. - Go. Is the 'fall and roll' trick for you? No. - Why are you so over enthusiastic? Hey, wait! It has gone under the cot. I thought she'd come out wrapped in a towel. This roach trapped itself there. Let's catch it. She has come out. - Let's hide. Wow! She's like a 'tandoori chicken' wrapped up in a silver foil. If only I get her, I'll build a temple for you. Hunt for the cockroach, I'll keep an eye on her. You'll eye her! - Don't I have to tell you where exactly to put it? That's right. - So hunt for it. Oh no! Just missed. She wrapped herself again. Didn't you see that? Did you? After using a swab for the ears I should have trashed it. I was so dumb to have kept it inside the ear. After you gave me the idea I should have got rid of you. Go away. - But will you be alone? Am I planting a bomb in Kashmir to need company? I can handle a cockroach. If you need help.. Okay. - Go, please go. What are you doing here? Get down. You're the one on top of me. What's happening? Oh no! Really heavy! Give that to me Sorry. Take it. - Hey! Hey, stupid! Will you just barge in to serve tea at any odd time? You won't tell what you saw here, right? He's guilty and I should zip my lips, is it so? I'm an eye witness to this disgraceful event. I won't tell. - Do you swear? If you don't trust me throw your towel down and I'll swear on it. - Hey! Is the visual proper? But why all this? My sister is scared of something here. To prove her wrong I'm fixing cameras around the house. Madhavi isn't imagining it. I've also sensed someone following me quite a few times. Look properly. It could be your octopus eyed cousin or the cook Paalsamy. The camera has shifted towards the wall. Turn a little to the right. Check now. What happened? I thought I saw a figure standing here. No one is here. I saw it in the monitor. You'd have seen one of the dolls here. I don't know why all of you react so strangely to this place! What are you doing here? - Sister called you. Who is that? - Ms. Selvi. Shut up and go. Nutcase! Why are you still standing here? She's not letting me sleep! If you still bother me, I'll kill you. Loony face! Where are you looking? Baby? What are you doing here, dear? She's always here like a half crazed whacko. Why are you here at this time of the night, sir? - No.. I had a splitting headache. Can you make a cup of coffee for me? - Okay. Go and lie down next to your mother. She's a whacko in her head. Ignore her, sir. Baby, whom were you talking to last night? To my sister. Madhavi? Maya? No. - Then? This is Ms. Selvi. Where does she stay? Right next to you. I can't see anyone. She's looking right at you. Don't you see her? How does she look? Like this. Hello. - Welcome. Welcome, Ayyanar. He is late for his own sister's engagement. I got stuck with work. Let's go in. Where's my husband? He said he'd go home, freshen up and come. Let us not miss the auspicious time. Come soon. Move. We shouldn't be late in serving the food. Instead of stringing along Maya, you're stirring the gravy. Maya wants a groom who is a city boy with a 6 pack. He must also possess a loaded bank account. With many followers on the Facebook.. He should be superb and must be a singer too. How can I fulfill these requirements? You should change into Mohammed of Ghazni. Maya is a Hindu. Why should I convert? You should keep trying till you succeed, I meant. If you try, even trains can play on tar roads. I hereby announce, Valarmathi, sister of Ayyanar of Koviloor will marry Chinnayan, son of Nagaraj of Melur on the 6th day of Karthigai as decided by the elders who have gathered here today. Exchange the plates with your offering. - Yes. "Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?" "Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?" "Kindling you, I was floored. My feelings went overboard." "Love rang on your mobile as a missed call meanwhile." "Shall I open my heart to you? Gather dreams of love true." "I'll caress, express always. I lost myself, don't you see?" "Can't you express your love in a single word?" "Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?" "My white 'puri'.. Sweet pretzel.." "I want to canoodle with every inch of yours." "Tonight I'd like you to be my wife for eternity." "Your glamour and my humor combined will work out fine, my baby." "From the size of your shoe to your diet plan." "I'll note it all. As it's my hobby." "I've bracketed you, dear. You're my target." "Like a rocket, don't fly high into the sky.." "Take U-turn and depart in high speed, towards my heart." "I think of you, and like an angel you appear at once." "I bagged your love-seat with a handkerchief." "Don't make it a no ball, please." "Ask your Doberman about me. Your puppy is my pet-buddy." "I just need your pretty head to nod. Why does it take so long?" "Just one look will do to share your love true." "Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?" "Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?" Why are you still awake? I'm not getting sleep. Thanks for the coffee. - Okay, sir. Jakkamma predicts good time for all of you. Maiden of this house will be married soon. Oracle of Jakkamma! The hero of her heart will come in search of her. Good times ahead. A wedding is just round the corner. Festive air around this house shortly. Lady of the house will have her wishes fulfilled. Happy events will take place. Jakkamma's words.. Oh no! Hello? Ravi? Murali, what happened? I've been hunting for you everywhere. Come down. Tell me. - Come down. I'll tell you. Listen to me. Move aside. Son, look at this tragic occurrence. They were always willing to give their lives for the palace. I never treated them like servants at all. They were more like my own brothers. I won't spare the killer. They've been killed elsewhere and dumped into this river. Old man? Who came to the palace last night to foretell? I think it was Sangili. Hey, Sangili! Someone has come in search of you from the palace. From the palace? Why are you running like this? I don't know anything. Let me go, sir. Tell me the truth. What did you see at the palace? Why did you run away? - Sir. Don't let anyone stay there. Leave that place at once. Your lives are in danger. - What are you saying? One of the inmates of the palace has been possessed by a spirit, sir. I swear on Jakkamma. I saw it myself. When I came to the palace last night.. Maiden of this house will be married soon. Save me.. - Jakka.. I saw it killing a man in the most gruesome manner. Can you identify the person? That's difficult, sir. But the spirit has possessed a girl, sir. It's not an ordinary harmless spirit. It was very ferocious. Its fury has not subsided at all. Take it, sir. This is an egg, sanctified for 41 days in the cemetery. You take it home. This egg will identify the person the spirit has possessed, sir. I don't.. Don't hesitate, sir. We don't know who else it will kill. We already have 3 victims. - Go soon, sir. There is something there. I thought I saw someone standing here. Right next to you. Take it, sir. In this world, there are many powers beyond our perception. Have faith, sir. The cook left without giving us any notice. We thought the drunkard driver had passed out somewhere. We saw the servant even last night. All this is shocking even for us, Inspector. Call everyone to assemble here. We must question all of them separately. - Do you suspect us? The lawyer is here. Clarify with him. This is a common police procedure. We'll have to cooperate. What? Hey, pal.. Wait for me. Are you taking your dirty clothes to wash them in the river? What? Someone killed 3 servants who worked in this house. And threw them into the river. Do you expect the corpse to be thrown in front of your house? The three dead men worked in this place. We are the last employees alive. They were original. We are duplicates. We know that. But the killer doesn't, right? Inspector has told us not to step out till this case is solved. That's why the whole family is staying indoors. If we go out, we'll become the prime suspects. Get back inside. Do you believe firmly that the spirit is called Selvi? Our servant's little girl always talks of a Ms. Selvi. Let's try our luck. 'Mortuary' Wait.. Wait. Don't let them go in. The entire town has gathered here. How long will it take, sir? - Sir.. 3 corpses, sir. We can't cater to your impatience. Please wait. You wanted information on a girl called Selvi, right? I thoroughly checked the police records. 5 years ago, a girl called Selvi ran away with the temple jewels. She is nowhere to be found. This is her profile. - That girl was.. Why do you want to know about her? Already 3 murders have taken place in the village.. I thought it has got to do.. - With that priest's daughter Selvi? She disgraced our entire town. Why discuss her now? Move aside. Watch your step. Let them bring the body out. You left me behind. Selvi was a good girl, sir. Don't believe what they say. You are.. I'm the priest's daughter. Selvi grew up in our house. Though we both weren't blood sisters we grew up like siblings. Hello? - Will you surely chase away the suitor who is coming? Why this silly doubt? So far, I've packed away 11 prospective grooms. How can this one alone escape? He's very affluent. He is coming in a car. Last week, the suitor who came on a moped was sent packing, sans his bike by me. Is the suitor driving down this time? Careful, Selvi. Don't get into trouble. Hang up now. I can see a car. - Selvi.. Bull's eye! How do we go to the priest's house? Go straight and turn right. Thank you very much. Why do you want to go there? To see his daughter as a prospective bride. Daughter? - Let's go. - Then who's he? If you don't know to drive why didn't you bring a driver along? I was driving properly. Some idiot hit me with a stone. Car is stuck in a ditch now. Can you lend me a hand to push the car out? - Sure. Push some more. That's right. You want to take the car out, right? - Yes. Keep the keys in the car and come with me. The car will follow us automatically. What do you mean? Trust me. Are you into this voodoo or black magic and stuff like that? None of that nonsense. Just hide yourself here. The car will come here. If I hide, will the car come here? How? Are you new to this town? This is my hometown. I'm coming back here after a very long time. What are you doing? This is the stone I was hit by. I'll preserve it, complain to the police. I'll set sniffer dogs on to the culprit. And pack him off to jail. Just wait and watch what I do. Why are you making a big issue out of nothing? It's not a small incident. It's an attempt to murder. I won't let him off the hook. If he had missed a little I'd be a dead body! You must be well connected. My car has come just as you said. Go and stop the car without buttering me up. - You're correct! Hello! Hold on. Thanks. Is he the owner of the car? - Thanks. Sorry, sir. Sorry. I didn't know. I'm thanking you but you're apologizing to me. I'm apologizing and you're thanking me! Sorry. - What's wrong with him? Did you think he came to help you? - Then. He came to steal your car. Watch out! This village is filled with thieves. You can't even leave a toy cycle unguarded! And you left the key on the ignition. What planning! Great! Okay, I'll take leave. Your car is okay, no! Someone by mistake threw a stone at you. Why preserve it? You might as well throw it away. I won't let the culprit go scot-free. I'll ensure he or she goes to jail for at least 5 years. Where has this chap disappeared? Hello, where are you? Look up, right above you. This side. It's been half an hour since I came here. As a thief, do you have any sense of responsibility? Okay, fine. Why don't you do your job in a jiffy? What were you waiting for? I need to bargain with you. I'll pay you the 300 bucks that we agreed upon. Not enough. It's a small stone after all that you'll be stealing. The object is small. But the subject is huge! Isn't there a difference in pick-pocketing 50 bucks and stealing the same from a bank locker? - Okay. Agreed! I'll give you extra 50 bucks. Get the pebble. - Done! How much I had to talk to get an extra 50 bucks! What's he doing for so long? Somehow this year, we must find a good girl for Murali. That's why you should perform a ritual in our temple. So I asked you to come here all the way from Mumbai. Make arrangements for it immediately. We are coming here after so many years. We need to consult the priest and fix an auspicious day. Stone is missing. Found it? I got so many items. Not just a pebble or a stone, I can buy even a quarry! I'll kill you. I only asked you to find the stone I hit him with. Is it a priceless diamond? It's just a pebble, right? If I come to such a fancy place and steal just a pebble it's a disgrace to my family. Can a leopard change its spots! If you bathe a mongrel and bring it to the hall it will only go lick all kinds of rotten stuff. Instead of licking, can a dog go to a restaurant and eat? You're talking too much. Go help yourself, okay? Bungling burglar! - Oh no. What's that noise about? - Thieves. They have broken in. How audacious to have broken into the palace to steal! If we nab them, they are dead meat! Search every nook and corner. - Look there. I swear I'm not a thief. Then what are you doing here at this hour? I came to take back that pebble. - Why? If you complain to the police, they'd bring the dogs. Why should that affect you? I was the one to hit you with it. Forgive me. I'm leaving. Don't go that way. You'll get caught. Come with me. Is he hiding somewhere in the dark? Come soon. This way. Look properly, man. Who the heck are you? What are you doing here? Ask the girl standing right beside you. Shut up, you ass. You are to be blamed. I came only to steal the stuff inside the house. You stole the owner himself! I came to save her skin. What kind of landlord are you? Looks like you will hand over the keys to her on a platter! One must never steal in a house without a grill or any thrill! See you? If I get caught alone they'll call me a thief. My reputation will be in tatters if I'm caught along with you! He should not escape. Where could he be? Oh no! What? I'm caught. What do I do now? Remove your half-sari! You have a one track mind. It is only to save you. If I cover my face and run they'll chase me thinking that I'm the thief. You can escape through the other way. What say? Okay. Close your eyes. Close your eyes tight. Didn't you come for this? I'll run this way and you can escape. I heard a sound but I can't see anyone. Ask them to check the terrace. Hey! Who are you? Catch hold of him. If you're a real man, show us your face and don't run. Ask Ramya to get ready soon. I've asked the groom's family to meet me at the temple. I'll go and fetch them. - Is the suitor's family on the way? Father, this is so unexpected. If I tell you in advance some problem or the other crops up. They come into our town but don't visit us here. So I arranged this without telling anyone. Get ready.. - Selvi.. I'll bring them.. - What do we do now? Get married. - I'll kill you. I want to study. I don't want to get married. If he's coming to town I can catapult him away. Now they are coming to our door step! The groom's family is here. Come quickly. Is the priest here? He's expected anytime now. Please sit down. Careful, son. Hello? Tell me, Ayyanar. Where are you? At the priest's house. What? You come here. We'll wait for you. No problem. Will you come here? Thanks, dear. Thank you. I like this groom a lot. You said you didn't want to get married at all. That was before I saw his face. He's too tall for you! If I can get him, won't I find a pair of slippers? I'll wear heels. Why are you both whispering secrets? We all like the groom. He seems too tall. - Groom? Yes, groom. Mani, tell her. It you think he's too tall we can make the girl stand next to him. How can we allow that? The bride and her friend are of the same height. Ask her to come. That's a fact as well. - Go and stand, dear. Stand on your toes and make them agree somehow. Don't feel shy. Come and stand. Mr. Ayyanar is here. Why did you take the trouble? I told you I'd ask the priest and let you know. I was feeling restless. So I thought I'd come in person and find out. Since we are performing the ritual of redemption after a long time the priest feels we should get divine ordinance. Aren't they the groom's family? You silly old lady! They are from the palace. The groom and his family aren't coming today. Tomorrow is Friday. If you go there when our goddess foretells you can find it out. I'll take your leave. - Okay. Priest, please make all other arrangements. I'll go with madam to the temple tomorrow. Mr. Chairman, they are from the palace. Our goddess will foretell only good news for you. In this era, how can you believe in such silly superstitions? Just keep quiet. Our goddess is here. Praise be to Shakti! Didn't we see this girl at the priest's place yesterday? Same girl. - Her family came from North India 20 years ago, to restore the temple. Both her parents died in an accident when the walls of the temple collapsed. The entire town accepted this orphan. And she's being raised by the priest now. No one anticipated this. On a full moon day when she was just 5 years old she was possessed by the goddess and she started foretelling. We believe that maybe having orphaned her the goddess decided to use her body for prophesy. Due to the divine presence, whatever the girl speaks comes true is what we believe. Whoever wants to ask about any problem, please do so. Let's go and find out whatever is troubling you. It's my daughter's wedding next week. And my eldest son is suffering from chicken pox. How can You do this to us, Goddess? He'll be fine within 2 days. - You clear your doubt. I've never left anything undone in any of my vows. And even if I did, please forgive me. We've been trying to find a suitable bride for my son but not a single alliance is suitable. You should only show me the kind of girl he likes. Praise be to Shakti! Offer the lit camphor. Praise be to Shakti! What happened? Nothing. - Hi! Why didn't you answer my mother's question? Let's go. - One minute. I don't know to talk in a roundabout way. I liked you very much the moment I met you. I want to marry you. What say? Tell me, Selvi. I'm not the kind of girl you think I am. My lifestyle is totally different from yours. We won't be compatible. If you had said, you don't like me, I'd have left at once. Don't give me silly excuses. My train leaves at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. I'll be waiting for you till 3:30. I'll be most happy if you say 'yes' by then. If you don't come, I will assume that you don't like me. And after that I won't trouble you. Think and let me know. "You were the one to propose.. I became yours.. Really close.." "All that I have thought, will happen, isn't it true?" "Even if I change into breeze, I'll be a part of your breath with ease." "Even if I am as sublime as a dream I'll hold myself together for you." "What happened to me and you? We found love in each other." "You were the one to propose.. I became yours.. Really close.." "All that I have thought, will happen, isn't it true?" "When I sit on the swing under the banyan tree you'll caress me." "Pinch me and hide." "In the moss laden lily pond when I take bath" "you'll stoke fire in me soulfully." "When Sun is sleeping goats go a-bleating.." "I sleep in a cocoon of your love and you dwell in my heart." "Even our family deity's sari shines like you, enchantingly." "I have a million desires." "I dream of the day we'll unite." "I was a design on the temple stone, you gave me a home to own." "I was a light to the town but you accepted me as yours." "Your memories within me will stay in my soul till eternity." "You're the only boon I need. For nothing else would I plead." "What happened to me and you? We found love in each other." "You were the one to propose.. I became yours.. Really close.." "All that I have thought, will happen, isn't it true?" "Even if I change into breeze, I'll be a part of your breath with ease." "Even if I am as sublime as a dream I'll hold myself together for you." See you. That's the last time I saw her. Then they blamed her unfairly for stealing the temple jewelry. She isn't a thief, sir. Only she can tell us what happened. After she left I lost my happiness and dreams of studying. Then my father got me married to a textile shop owner. Maya, why are you standing here, all by yourself? I'm so bored. They said the store room contains old albums. I thought I'd see them. But I'm scared to step in. - Why? What if there's any spirit inside? How can a ghost appear when I am around? What nonsense! Aren't you scared of ghosts at all? Ask any ghost to come in front of me. I'll give a tight one. I've also been eager to see a ghost for a long time. But the ghost is too scared of me. I take spirits to watch films. I am a brave man! Come inside. Come. I never thought you'd be so brave. When I was young, I used to brush my teeth with ash from the cemetery. And scrape my tongue with a chest bone. Only the coward looks at it as a skeleton. For one who scares others, it's merely a sparrow's nest. But I'm petrified of ghosts. Cowards who can't profess their love and have a premature death end up as spirits. Brave souls like me who can express their love freely, shouldn't fear ghosts. So have you expressed your love? I intend to. You'll witness it. It's time that I express. Paalsamy, I found the album. You can lock the door and come. Then who is this? If you see a ghost, you'll give it a tight slap, right? How will I have the guts to slap a spirit? You said, you scraped your tongue with a chest bone. I didn't realize I said all that. Forgive me. You wished to see a ghost, right? I actually didn't mean it. Should you take my words as that from the Gospel? Boss, why are you in such a pitiful state? When you and Ms. Maya went into a room alone, I was worried. I knew something like this would happen. Like what? What happens when cotton and fire are placed near each other? There ought to be fire. Was her response real wild? You're way too fast, boss. You've played a wild game. Who? Me? You don't know what you're talking about. Wait, boss. Let me pacify your lady love. Any man will feel this way if he sees a beautiful girl. Just say 'yes' and marry him, instead of regretting your deed. There's no other choice. You've lost your chastity and only he can wipe off the stain. Your turn now. - Oh no. Oh no.. Men can make mistakes and get away with it, isn't it? We won't. Boss, save me. You'd have heard of Thai massages. This is spiritual massage. Enjoy! Don't hit me. Do I have to agree to marry him? No, don't. 'You interviewed a ghost.' 'You're so dead.' Why didn't you tell this before? Did you even let me open my mouth? Let's scoot from here. Sister, isn't it over? A little rest.. What? - For you, I mean. My shirt is torn. What happened just now? Boss, when did I come into the storeroom? They must have thought of you as an antique piece! We've come to Level 1 of this house only now. Let's escape before we reach Level 2. Get up. Go. Madhavi, come here. Your brother has bought you saris. Come and choose one for yourself. Take whichever design you like, ma'am. Why are you standing still? Pick one. Look at this. This color will suit you. Ramya, hold on. Keep this money. - No, thank you. Your brother paid. - It's okay, take it. Tell me if you need anything else. No. I'm not used to all this. I have never taken money from anyone in this manner. Won't you take it from your Selvi? Selvi? It was not my fault at all. It was unfair of them to beat me up to death. That day I went to meet Murali so eagerly, remember? Selvi! Mr. Chairman called me to the temple saying it was some urgent business. I'm on the way to meet someone. This is an emergency. Get into the car. He forced me to come even though I refused. Only when I reached the temple I found out that someone had stolen the jewels of our goddess. And replaced them with fake ones. The elders of the village were discussing it. We are the only few trustees. If we go to the police, it will be humiliating. I knew who the thief was when I touched the fake jewelry. We'll collect money from the villagers and get new jewelry. - Don't worry. The jewelry will be returned tomorrow. I stopped Ayyanar on the way and asked him about the jewelry. Why are you talking to me here, instead of talking at the temple? After initially denying it, he ended up accepting it. Not only that. How long will you survive being a foreteller? Take 10 lakhs from me and find a decent way to live. This is all the respect you deserve from me. Before the sun rises tomorrow, return.. I gave you a chance to survive because you're a young girl. Did you listen? Why couldn't you take up my generous offer? You're making me kill somebody you once prayed to! When it's between money or God I'd choose money anytime. Ayyanar, why are you standing here? If your car has conked off, travel by my car instead. Nothing of that sort. Needed to relieve ourselves. That's all? - Then I'll leave. Go, find her. She fell here. - She's not here. Where's she? - Where is she? She's missing. Don't let her get away. This is good news. Selvi is a lucky girl. Give this good news to your mother. She'll gladly prepare for the wedding. Wait, man. I've just expressed my love for her. Don't I need to know what she thinks? Let's see if she comes. Then I'll tell my mother. Why would she ever say no to you? She'll definitely come. Hello? Murali! - Yes. - Let's start. Mom, I'm not ready. You go first. It's time for the train. Let's leave now. He's found a reason to stay behind now. You go. I'll bring him. You are acting so irresponsible these days. You bring him on time to catch the train. I'll take care of it. We'll leave. Start the car. I take responsibility to bring him to the station. Drive carefully. Come, Selvi. Murali told me everything. I'm very happy now. You've found a good family to get married into. You seem to be hurt. - I fell on my way. Sit down. I'll get you coffee. No, I don't want all that. I need to see him. Such a hurry to see him! He's in the shower. He'll come out anytime. I'll go and get coffee. You sit down. Sir.. - What are you doing here? Ayyanar is coming. He shouldn't know I'm here. Why? They want to kill me. They are thieves. They stole jewelry from the temple and.. Why, sir? - What else to do? Luckily, she came here. No one knows, right? That's why I stabbed her before anyone saw her. Samy? Samy? What is it? - What are you doing here? Are you ready? Ayyanar, I thought you were busy. You said you'd come directly to the station. - No. Samy called me here saying he had some important work. Important work? - Yes. You're entrusting this palace to him. He must come and send you off, right? Why this formality? Your mother has called up so many times. You'll miss your train. Leave right now. Sir, come here. - What? You know everything and you're packing me off. How can I go without seeing Selvi? If that girl loves you as much as she claims she'd have come and met you by now. Isn't it evident from this, that she isn't keen? No, I know she loves me. She will definitely come. It's not that. What I want to say is.. As a child, she grew up the hard way as an orphan. I want her to enjoy all the comforts and happiness from now on. I will marry Selvi and keep her happy forever. I know she'll come looking for me. If I wait for a few minutes, I feel my life will change. Just wait and watch. She'll come for me. I can't forget her. Girls here are shy. They won't talk so openly. No, sir. Your mother has been waiting at the station for a long time. Please leave. Leave now. You leave, I will meet her and tell her. Have faith. I'm there for you. Come. Ask the driver to bring the car to the porch. Listen to me! Listen? You're like my brothers. I beg of you. I wish to live. I'll be well settled. I'll move out of the city with him and never tell a soul about this. I won't come near this town ever again. I swear, I'll never come in front of you. I'll go and live somewhere else. Think of me as your sister and let me live, sir. Spare me, brother. I want to live. Ayyanar, why bury her inside this palace? It will stay locked. No one will ever find her. Cover it up with mud. Look over there. I wish to lead a happy life with husband and kids. Leave me. I beg of you. She's not dying though we hit her so hard. Stop showing off your bravery! Just cover up and bury her. Let her be buried alive. Leave me, brother. I want to live. I'm begging you. Do you know how much I begged all of them? One by one, I killed those who tortured me to death, mercilessly. I'll kill Ayyanar as well. And not just that I'll live in this body as Murali's wife, forever. Think it over, dear. Isn't it wrong? What is wrong? Madhavi is living the life I wanted. You know how happily I left home that day. If I had gone 2 minutes earlier the chairman might not have seen me on the way. I'd have met Murali in this very house. I'd have lived as Selvi. So tell me. What's wrong with what I'm doing? I didn't have the chance to unite with Murali till now. Solar eclipse starts at dawn. If I unite with him before that I'll stay in her body forever. Then no one can take me away from this body. Murali, what happened? Murali, you're bleeding. Let's go to the hospital. Don't make a fuss. It's such a small cut. Even if a tiny piece of glass remains inside it will get infected. Come with me. Why weren't you careful? Master's son is bleeding. I'll get the bullock cart. - Where to? We should lock you up in the house first. - Why? Don't we need a doctor? - They'll take care of all that. Just shut up. - Why are you joining us? How can I not come? Start the car. There's been a lot of blood loss. Put him on drips. - Okay. May I leave after this, doctor? - Leave? You have to stay here for 2 days. - Why? Why stay here for 2 days for such a small cut, Doctor? Glass has cut a vein. Bleeding hasn't stopped. He has to be under observation for 24 hours. He's been admitted, Ravi. - Thank you so much, Doctor. I lied only because you really insisted. As a doctor I shouldn't be doing this at all. Even now you have saved a life. Here is the admission form. Doctor, did you see my sister? - She left long ago. Left? Madhavi? Madhavi? Chicken biryani? They've killed 3 people who were with me. I'm really tense and you're talking about food! The number's busy. How will I know who killed them? The police officer is hounding me bad enough! Dumb female! You're adding to my stress level. The number's busy. I can't tell when I'll get back home. I'm on the way to see the minister. Hang up now. Why are you standing here? - My husband hurt his hand. Really? - I need to go to the hospital. My car broke down. Get inside. I'll drop you. Okay. Ayyanar, pick up the phone. I've been going from hospital to the police station the whole day. They've killed 3 people who were with me. I won't let go of the murderer. Let me get my hands on him.. Who's calling at this hour? - Hello! - Hello. Who is this? - Ayyanar, it's Ravi. Tell me. - Is my sister with you? Yes. Do you want to talk to her? Don't let her know I'm talking to you. Escape immediately - What are you saying? That's not my sister. She is Selvi, the girl you killed. She has come to take revenge as a spirit. I don't understand what you just said. Ayyanar? Ayyanar? Do you recognize me? Can you recognize me now? Let me go. - Don't do anything to me. This is exactly how I begged you that day. Why are you standing in there, you coward? Come out. Who is scared? Wasn't getting killed once enough? Have you come to die again? I'll take care of you in the morning. Only if I let you live until then! I won't. Do you know what dreams I had for myself? Did you let me? You killed me. You stole the temple jewelry, then why should I be punished? I won't let you live. You have to come out. We can't exorcise strong spirits like this, sir. She was born with divine powers. Because she was buried alive without fulfilling her dreams she's so fierce. Only a holy man, with divine powers of body and mind can control this spirit. One such good man is doing penance in Mukkoodal. If you ask him, he'll help you exorcise the spirit of Selvi. Hello? What, sir? Selvi is smarter than us. - What do you mean? She has got Murali discharged from the hospital. It'll take you 2 hours to go and meet the holy man. They shouldn't unite until then, sir. - I have a solution to that. Wait, sir. Priest? Why are you saying so about your own sister? Ravi, how can you believe in ghosts in this day and age? If you don't believe me, hold this in your hand and look at her. What is all this? Just look. Did you listen to me? Your brother is glaring daggers at me. I didn't want to come away. Your sister was so stubborn, she forced me to get discharged. Why did you go to the hospital at this hour of the night? Will the hospital take care of him better than I will? Murali is important to you. My sister is my priority! What is this? I saw some other girl. That is the girl called Selvi I told you about. A girl can defeat even a ghost, but the ghost is a girl in this case. Why? - She has come for Murali. If they unite tonight she'll stay forever in Madhavi's body. That shouldn't happen. If you tell Murali about this like you told us the danger can be averted, right? - Right. That will prove as a threat to his life. And if she knows that we know, all of us are dead as well. I'll go and ask the holy man how to deal with Selvi's spirit. Make sure that they don't sleep together until then. Why meet this good man? Be here with us and we'll deal with it together and make sure that they don't unite. It's a problem even if they don't. If I unite with him before the eclipse then I will be with him forever. If we don't, I'll kill Murali before dawn. We'll experience the life we couldn't experience in this world, in the netherworld. If what she intends happens, we'll never get back Madhavi. My sister's future and Murali's life. Both are in your hands. Boss, shall we roll out the spirit? You make it sound like the ghost is a mattress. If you poke your nose in a couple's love affair couples act devilish. Imagine how a spirit would react! I wonder how many of us will get a ghastly bruise! Tell me. - Sir, I've searched everywhere. We've just found this car. There's no one inside. We've found only a broken cell phone. You search. I'll come there now. What, boss? To keep them apart, why are you mixing laxatives to the milk? Then should I mix Ponds talcum powder? If they drink this, they can spend time only in the bathroom. Superb! But I have a doubt. - What? Can ghosts get diarrhea? - Good one. Give this to the ghost and we'll know. So many of you are here. Why should I be the chosen one? Birds of the same feather flock together! So it won't harm you. That's why I chose you. I can't go alone. Let's all go together. If you don't, I'll give this to your husband. He'll bug you by giving this to you as flavored milk. What do you say? - No. I prefer the ghost. - All the best, aunt. Go and give it carefully. If she finds out, just run into the garden. Good idea. Go with her. Grab the spirit's head and have a brawl. I've never served milk even to a cat, in my life. Now they've chosen me to serve it to a ghost. Come, aunt. You seem to be really romantic. I've been waiting for this day. Murali? What, aunt? - Drink a glass of milk before you sleep. Uncle just gave us milk. That's plain milk. This is special milk. How much milk can we drink? Drink it for your aunt's sake. Please drink it. - It's okay, no need, aunt. Didn't you hear him say 'no need'? What happened, aunt? Aunt's been behaving strangely ever since uncle hurt his head. Sorry. - Come, aunt. Milk is been spilt all over your sari, go and change. What happened to aunt? What happened? Did they drink the milk? Is the ghost in the bathroom? You and your stupid ideas. She dropped the glass of milk. Such a small task and she messed it up big time! What are you looking at? You look like a Burma doll with a drained battery! God! My chest is paining. Is that my aunt? - Murali! Come fast. Your chest is paining? - Not me. It's you. Lie down there. He's dying of chest pain. - What are you blabbering? Is Easu having a heart attack? - Not Easu. Our boss! - Boss? Don't spoil it. Be quiet. Shut up. He's dying here. And you want me to watch him die? Only a chef knows the value of another chef. What are you doing? - Mouth to mouth resuscitation. Even if you gave a flying kiss I'd have to clean my face with a disinfectant. A lip to lip! How did the Burma doll manage to make a baby with you?! What happened, aunt? Murali, he's suffering from chest pain. Lift him, let us take him to the doctor. Quick. Get him an ECG scan, X-ray, Xerox.. Everything! We'll follow you. - We'll take you at once. I can't handle this. I won't go. I won't come. - Come on. Don't spill the beans. Just play it cool. I won't go. I won't go. - Go. I thought it was a chest pain, but it's acidity. Let me go and sleep. Come inside. Let's go sleep. After a good deal of introspection I let her be with your family under your supervision. Because it's the family she has been married into she'll never show her true self to them. But she won't be patient for too long either. This solar eclipse, after 150 years coincides with 'Mahashivratri' the holy night when Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvati. At the same time, it's happening during sun rise as well. At this time, evil forces have greater power than the divine ones. No power can separate them if they unite during this time. That's why she has chosen this day. How do we stop her, Sage? - There are only 2 ways. One, your sister's soul should fight Selvi's spirit and come out. That's impossible. - What's the other option? To remove the malefic effect, when the 8 goddesses are immersed in the waters of Mukkoodal you must bring Murali to that spot. I'll bring him right now. - Wait! It's not that easy. The second the solar eclipse starts, her power will just keep multiplying. You can't do this alone. I will also accompany you. Oh God! They've gone into the room again. You missed a good chance. Was it a chance to eat 'dosa' with cricketer Dhoni? The driver of the jeep is a ghost, not Madhavi. She'd have easily killed me on the way. Why are we wasting time? Think of an idea quickly. That lets you off the hook from thinking, right? The makeup, jasmine flowers.. You've turned into a village girl. Because you like me this way. My nephew will have to live with a ghost forever. Do something, Paalsamy. Paalsamy is a bad boy. Just keep saying this and sit idle. I'm going straight into Murali's room. Whoever wants to, can come with me. I'm not so helpless to send you in alone. Let's all go together and attack the ghost. But we have to attack carefully. Let's collect all the stuff ghosts are scared of. Slippers! - Isn't it a good idea? I meant it will be scared of slippers. - Very good. Next? - God's picture. Broomstick. - Vermillion and lemon. - Sacred ash. Why wait? Take all the weapons. Sir, look there! Ayyanar? Hereafter, no one can separate us. Pick him up. Aunt? Always pick on me to cut the ribbon. Stop the car. Ayyanar, don't fight us. We need to go to the hospital. No, I don't need a hospital. Get me to a temple first. Listen to me. My life is in danger. Stop the car. Is Ayyanar out of his mind? Where is he? Your sister stormed out just like a demented soul. Murali has passed away in the bedroom. We can't wake him up no matter what we do. Ask all of them to leave the house. Shall we take Murali as well? They can't do that. Ask them to leave. The solar eclipse has begun. We don't have much time. We must hurry up. No, don't hurt me. Don't do anything to me. No don't. Come fast. Come. She has cast a spell on this boy. We must break that spell. Sage? - Go! What happened, Sage? She's coming back here. She is here now. You asked me to meet you if I loved you, and I did so. But you kept me waiting for too long. Madhavi! Murali, run. Sage.. They won't let us live in peace. Let's go. The spirit that hounds the palace chambers. In a woman like Rama's consort Sita, virtues personified. Flesh devourer who possesses to destroy an innocent soul. Pray to Shiva, the guardian of the cemetery with devout purity. To overcome with His might, drive far away the effacers of life. Let there be peace, peace and only peace. Do you think you can save your sister? Ask him to let go of Murali. You won't! Don't, Madhavi. Only if your sister remains alive can she keep him with her. Madhavi, what are you doing? Madhavi, don't do. Don't.. Listen to me. Madhavi! Listen to me! Madhavi, don't! We have only 15 minutes left. Leave for Mukkoodal with him right now. In this state.. - Don't worry. Nothing will happen to your sister. I can help her only till this fire keeps burning. Go fast. - Murali, come. What about Madhavi? Sage will take care of her. We have to go to Mukkoodal. "Here comes Periyachi the goddess of fury." "Enforcer of the universe shows her picturesque form." "Bedecked up with pearls, corals, gems and her sparkling smile." "One who feeds on bones.. Destroyer of demons." "Goddess covered with vermillion.." "Goddess of might, power and omniscience." Can you prevent me? "Goddess covered with vermillion.." "Goddess of might, power and omniscience." "Epitome of beauty, strength and destruction." "Time for Goddess Shakti to grace us with Her mercy." "Ruler who holds a symbol. Rides on a chariot resplendent." "Anklet tinkling, haunting cemetery. Chamundi.. Goddess of gallantry!" "Demolishing enmity and deceit with her weapon.." "Empyrean skies is Your sphere.. Earth is Your empathy empire.." "Who can oppose this deity? Her eyes are like fish, Meenakshi.." "Bathe the sinners in blood.. Slay the sinners of this world.." "Your hymn will always win.. Releaser of pain and suffering." "One who fulfills all vows in light, darkness and shadows." "Goddess Kali makes what is sown, grow and blossom." "She turns dreams into reality.. Mariamma, goddess of fertility." "She makes what is sown, grow and blossom" "While chasing the culprit, Goddess Neeliamma rises to the hilt." "Alleviating adversity, Goddess Sooliamma offers security." "Another avatar of Shakti helps you unravel a mystery." "Her devotees, She shelters.. She showers love on them.." What will you do now? Mukkoodal, 9 kilometers. Ravi.. Ravi.. What are you doing? Murali, my leg has got stuck. Don't do this. Madhavi, let him go. I still want to give him a child.. Your sister's soul has to fight Selvi's spirit and come out. She is expecting a baby. Happy? Madhavi, come out. Otherwise, the child in your womb will become an orphan. Yes, Madhavi. Doctor had called up and told me so. Before I could tell you, you were possessed. Murali, run! "Snakes coiled around her chest. Kathyayini, the warrior goddess.." "Sword is the weapon for Goddess Angalamman." "Polymorphous Goddess Durga, ferocious in her avatars." "Shiva's wife, Goddess Shakti" "appears in various avatars to help humanity." "Goddess of love and might." "Goddess of weapon and snakes." "Goddess of flowers and power." "Princess of might and elegance." "Omnipotent and omniscient." "Queen of the universe and beyond." "Shiva's other half" "Goddess Shakti" "in various avatars" "to help humanity.." "As Padmini, Malini, Bhairavi, Nandini, Vaishnavi.." "Ragini, Trangini, Eswari, Parameswari.." Madhavi! This area will turn into gold shortly. There will be an airport half a kilometer from here. One kilometer away, there'll be a harbor. Won't the planes clash with the ships? There is no sea nearby. You're lying about a harbor. As if an airport will be constructed here. I have sold illegal land with false documents to many idiots as such. Do you want to sell this place? I do. Have you ever seen a buyer buy after your sales talks? No. - Don't see. Continue. If you dig up the soil here you will find water just 2 feet deep. 2 feet? Then how can a house be built? - Hey.. Don't interrupt, man. You're killing my flow. What's your problem? - Okay. - Idiot. Not just that around this area, many schools colleges, hospitals, flyovers.. They've been struggling for a bus to ply for the past 10 years on the roads to the nearest town. And this fat light bulb is lying through her teeth. Don't kill it, Paalsamy. Then we won't even get the commission. Hey ditcher! How dare you call me by name, without respect! I'm not getting any share anyway. How does it matter how I call you? - Hey! Shall I talk or not? Adjust her makeup. - Okay. - You're sweating. Look, Paalsamy. - What is it, master? I'll give you one week's time. If you don't sell it by then, there's a buyer in Mumbai. Don't be in a rush. With the commission I am about to make, I must pay back their loans. Get it organized fast. Instead of me becoming a millionaire by revealing my grandma's secret I've been made to chase my money like an agent. Don't worry, Paalsamy. I'll give you my share. How do you get a share? If I hook up with someone who owns the property I get to co-own it. He's showing off rubbing salt on to my wounds. You've not just saved my sister, but you've helped me get Maya as well. Me? - Yes. I was helping you out with your problems on love, and I found my life partner. That's why. My share will be yours. Do you want some juice, boss? How low can you stoop? I won! I won! Why is he playing? I won. - What's the matter? He saw me packing my bags and everything. He thought I was going to stay in a hostel and study. And he tied the nuptial thread again In haste. Don't be too hasty, master. Your sister is now an adult. Now you can't do anything to me. Easu, boil some milk for me. Why would you boil milk in a broken down bungalow? - Go.
